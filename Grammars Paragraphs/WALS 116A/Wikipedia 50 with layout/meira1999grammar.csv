Yes/no-questions    are clearly     different     from   wh-questions     (or a- questions, since most Tiriy6 interrogatives start with a): the former are characterized mostly by rising intonation (cf. 2.5.2), while the latter are distinguished by the presence of an interrogative word (cf. chap. 8). To illustrate the intonational difference between normaldeclarative clauses and a yes/no question, examples                   (40a-b) from 2.5.2 are repeated as(72a-b) below.","[580, 581]"
"Hoff 1968:212ff analyzes cognate forms in Carib of Surinam as belonging to two differentverbs;    Gildea   1989    does     the   same   for Panare.    Notice,   however,    that   the   ‘stative’   vs.‘inchoative’ distinction is not really consistent: e-stem forms can have non-inchoative uses,as in (131b) below, the past tense equivalent of (131a).

Table 5.15). Also,all nominalizations have only one form. For instance, w-eh-to(po) is an e-stem form, but itcan have stative (a-stem) semantics, as in (132). For these reasons, it seems better to treatthe a- and e-stem forms as belonging to the same verbal paradigm.(132)         taréno_me        é-w-eh-to                 wi-pono            ii-ja

              ‘I have (just) told him/her that you are a Tiriyé.’              An interesting detail from the comparative Cariban perspective is the existence ofonly one third person form in the Present Gnomic. Many other Cariban languages have atleast two forms: mana            and (h)nae in Apalaf (Koehn & Koehn                 1986:101), may     and nai inAkawayo          (Fox, pers. comm.), man and nai in Wayana (Jackson                       1972:54), mafj, na andnafj     in     Carib   of    Surinam      (Hoff    1968:212),     nas(i)   and     nay   in   Waiwai   (Hawkins1998:167ff), etc. These two forms usually mark the difference between visual and non-visual evidence. In Tiriyé, however, the form nai is used in all contexts. It can be used forboth questions and answers              (133a-b). Furthermore,        (133b) is the only way to say about abox that it is empty, regardless of whether the speaker opened it to look inside, or justweighed it in his/her hands, or is telling someone else that s/he need not open the box. (Butcf. 9.1.3.2, on the particle nara, for possible remnants of another third-person form).(133a)        ari-ra_n-ai ?                        (b)      aha, ari-ra_n-ai

"           About rheme, it is possible to say, judging by the pattern presented by questions andanswers,     that it is associated   with sentence-initial position. Notice      that interrogatives,     ifpresent, always begin the sentence, and that the optimal answers have the unknown elementalso at the beginning (94a-b); the question marks indicate answers that were considered‘possible, but less natural’. Sentence-initial position also seems to be important for focus,considering that it is occupied by elements that correct wrong presuppositions (94c-d).

        Word order appears to be pragmatically oriented. However, the ‘unmarked’ positionis apparently different for different clause types (cf. 10.3). Habitual past clauses (cf. 10.3.4)and remote past clauses (cf. 10.3.3) have a clear tendency toward OVA, while conjugatedsentences do not, as shown in Table 10.5.","[602, 603]"
"            As   is mentioned    in 3.4.5   and   in the beginning      of Chap.     8, the particle _hpe‘indefinite’ always co-occurs with interrogatives to form the equivalent of an indefinitepronoun (‘someone/anyone’,             ‘somewhere/anywhere’, etc.), with the implication that thespeaker does not know—or does not care about—the specific circumstances. So, (26a)was a reply to ‘At what time is he coming?’; (26c) is a reply to ‘What is he doing?’ .'? In(26b), a specific person is coming, but the speaker does not know who s/he is. (26d) alsorefers to a period in time which was specific—the amount of time that a certain characterspent in the forest—but not known to the speaker.(26a) ati        juuru_hpe, ji-wame                  (b) aki_hpe               n-ee-ja-n

Notice also that the combination of the anaphoric animate pronoun néré with _ré is,idiosyncratically, nééré,      instead of the expected    *néré_ré       (30g; cf. 4.1.2).

" 4 KjV/ Sequencies tend to be pronounced as /i.V/ in fast speech, as e.g. /pija_sa/ ‘a little bit’
 [pi.ja:.ga]~[pi.a:.sa] (notice that the /a/ is still stressed, showing that there still is a syllable boundary before
it). In slow speech, especially when the word is carefully enunciated, the /j/is consistently pronounced.
 'S Given this fact, one might wonder whether sequences of vowel + /i/ and vowel + /u/ should not be
analyzed as vowel + /j/ and vowel + /w/. However, in the absence of any phonological processes
distinguishing these two cases, no principled decision can be made. Descriptively speaking, it seems to be a
question of arbitrary choice to decide whether to increase the set of vowel sequences (which would include
/ael, laol, léel, foe/ anyway), or the set of syllable-final consonants (which already has /h/ and /n/). A similar
situation applies to the analysis of inherently long vowels as underlyingly long, or as sequences of identical
vowels (cf. 1.5.1.1).
'€ There is some variation between /ao/ and /au/ in certain words; one speaker had /jaohpi/ ‘my

available corpus; all cases were verbless equatives (e.g. aki €mé ‘who are you?’). Unfortunately, speakers
were not asked about whether aki or ati plus a copula was possible.

3.4.4. Postpositions. Postpositions can inflect for person (with the same markers used toindicate the possessor on nouns, the object on transitive verbs, and the subject on onesubgroup of intransitive verbs; cf. 3.3.1); they also have a reciprocal form (with a prefixalso found on     verbs    and on some      nouns;         cf. 3.3.1.4). They    can be morphologicallydistinguished from nouns and verbs in that they do not take typical noun or verb affixesother   than   person     markers;    moreover,      the     collective    number    of   the   object   of     apostposition is indicated with the suffix -:ne (instead of -ko(mo), used on nouns, or -ti(i),-té, -hki(i), used on verbs). Like adverbs, postpositions can take the nominalizing suffixes-(no) and (more rarely) -to.(34a)   k-éwe              ‘inside of us (=me and you)’
(b)     k-éwéé-ne          ‘inside of us (=all of us)’                     (collective marker -:ne)

Postpositional phrases behave like adverbs;therefore, they cannot be subjects or objects of verbs, or of other postpositions, withoutbeing nominalized.(35)    * j-epiné_pée

        Some   interrogatives   have   nominal   properties   (ati ‘what   (Inanimate)’,   aki   ‘who(Animate)’, aano     ‘which’); these are the interrogative pronouns. Others have adverbialproperties (aja ‘where to’, anpo ‘where’, eeke ‘how’, atitoome ‘why’, etc.); these are theinterrogative adverbs.

In thissection, the possible relevance of the first two distinctions for Tiriy6 is examined;                       cf.4.3.1.4.2, 4.3.1.5 for the question of alienability.","[213, 214]"
"If wéri and kawéno are separated by the verb, their propensity for coreferentiality is greatlyreduced, which is indicated by the question mark preceding the coreferential interpretationin (34d-e). It is much easier to interpret the ‘afterthought’ as referring to the person who istalking (the S participant) than to the woman.               This can be       ‘corrected’ by repeating thepostposition _pé(ké), as in (34f-g). This behavior suggests a closer bond between wéri andkawéno    in (34a-b), where there is no need to repeat the postposition in order to preventkawéno from referring to the person who is talking.",[548]
"           The meaning of _pe(Ke) thus comes very close to that of -ripi. They only differ inthat -ripi may have moral connotations (‘evil’, ‘sinful’) which _pe(ke) does not. Thus, in(76f), witoto-ript may denote a sinner, a bandit, i.e.            a person who does not follow theaccepted moral code; this would not be the case for someone who is witoto_pe.
8. INTERROGATIVES        Interrogative words in Tiriyé do not really form a lexical class in the same sensethat nouns, verbs or postpositions do; rather, they are a group of elements from thenominal and adverbial class that share the following properties (first introduced in 3.4.5):
        (A) sentence-initial occurrence in wh- (rather, a-) questions;        (B) co-occurrence with the indefinite particle _hpe (cf. 9.1.4).","[451, 452]"

The-to(-no) nominalizer, which can still be synchronically analyzed as the nominalized formof -té ‘potential A adverbializer’ (cf. 6.2.2.1, 4.2.2.1), is included in order to fill a gap inthe semantic field in question. All affixes listed here are totally productive within theirdomain      of definition (all verb stems, all transitive verb stems, or all intransitive verbstems).",[188]

9.2.1. Sentence equivalents. These words represent the speaker’s reaction to somethingthat the hearer has just said. More often than not, they occur as single-word sentences;even when an explicative sentence follows, they still remain extra-sentential (compare thepossible positions of _pa ‘Repetition’ with the sentence equivalent ma ‘new theme’ andthe conjunction iréme                ‘then, so’ in (44a-d)). The clearest exception is mpa, which cansometimes be followed by a dependent complement verb in the supine (see below).

         “Then (s/he) went away.’         Aha signals agreement (45a-b), and its opposite, owa, disagreeement (45c). Theyare close to the English word ‘yes’ and ‘no’, but they are not entirely equivalent, since theuse of aha and owa with negative questions is exactly the opposite of that of ‘yes’ and‘no’ in English (ie. aha agrees, and owa                disagrees, regardless of the polarity of thequestion; cf. (45d-e)). Owa        is clearly a word, obviously related to the negative particlewa(a); it can also, given the circumstances, mean                ‘nothing’ or ‘nobody’     (45d). Aha,       onthe other hand, looks less stable. Its pronunciation can vary from [aha] to [sho], comingsometimes quite close to the agreeing sound usually spelled as ‘m-m’                        or ‘hm-hm’        inEnglish. Notice also that it is possible to find intensifying particles after owa, but notafter aha (e.g. owa_rén, owa_rén_ken ‘Not at all! Never!’, with _rén(ne) ‘truly, genuine’and _ke(ne) ‘Continuative’, but not *aha_rén or *aha_rén_ken).(45a)    —sen_se              man-a-n ?           (b)    ——€-waaré_w-a-n ?

Acommon way of ending a story is by saying naka ‘that’s it’, or naka menjaaré ‘that’s itfor now’ (50a). Naka wija ‘enough to me’ can be used to express the idea of satisfactionwith one’s portion (‘no more for me’). It can also be used to talk about the end of anactivity (50b), or about running out of something (50c). In the latter cases, it looks lesslike a sentence equivalent and more like an adverb; however, its lack of class-changingmorphology vouches for its particle status.

        Npa is a hortative particle, meaning ‘let’s go’ (equivalent, in this respect, to thehortative form of té[mi] ‘go’, which is kiténne ‘let’s go’). It is most frequently used byitself, but it can, if need be, take a supine (‘purpose-of-motion’) complement (51). Npasentences are the only attested cases of utterance-initial consonant clusters (cf. 2.4. 1-2).

The      most     ‘interjection-like’   (i.e. less likely tooccur with ka) words in this subclass are tee ‘surprise’, péé ‘concern’ and &é ‘lament’;'®cf. (52a-d). They are usually pronounced with a final long vowel and a non-level intona-tion (tee quick rising, péé slow rising, é€ slow lowering). (52a) is said by a speaker whounexpectedly meets a woman who had already been mentioned to him by his guide. (52b)is said by a speaker who realizes a distressing truth (‘What am I going to do now?’); usedby itself, péé can express pity (e.g. when listening to someone’s complaints:                        ‘Oh, howsad/awful/bad!’). (52c) is said by Cayman,            a character in a folk tale, who tried to catch asquirrel but was fooled by it instead. Notice that é€ can be prolonged quite dramatically,sounding like a wail. The call ee ‘Hey!’ probably belongs here, although it occurred muchless frequently that the other three. In (52d), it signals that the speaker saw something thathe liked (in this case, cassava beer).(52a)    tee!      mée     ponoo-ja-n,     tii-ka-e            witoto

         The sound-symbolic words listed in Table 9.2 as interjections occurred generallywithout ka-support, but not always (54c). Some                  of them refer to noises related to, orproduced by, the action: in (54a), Iguana is making his typical noise as he climbs up atree; in (54b), Tapir is hitting a tree, to cause an old enemy to fall down; in (54c), a man isled back home by the barking of the dogs. In certain cases, the sound-symbolic word issimilar to the lexical verb stem used to describe the action (compare kif in (54d) withKitka ‘rub O’, and perhaps also with [t]ki ‘grate O°; jum in (54e) with juuka ‘bend O’;meen in (54f) with ame[mi] ‘roll O up’), but this is not always the case (cf. (54g-h)). It isinteresting to notice that some of these sound-symbolic words correspond to less ‘noisy’

 10. SYNTAX
10.1. Introduction. Of all aspects of grammar, it is in the realm of syntax that Caribanlanguages are least understood, in spite of having attained world celebrity with cases ofOVS as the basic word order (cf. e.g. Derbyshire & Pullum 1981). There are more detailedstudies for two          languages,        Carib     (also known            as Kari’na: Hoff             1968,    1978,        1986,    1990,1995, and also Gildea 1994a) and Hixkaryana (Derbyshire 1979, 1985, 1986a). The syntaxof four        other    languages       has      received      some        attention:    Apalai         (Koehn        &     Koehn      1986),De’kwana (Hall 1988), Macushi (Abbott 1991, Carson 1981), and Waiwai (Hawkins 1998).","[502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512]"
"            Jahpénté has the -nté ‘beneficiative’ verbalizer (cf. 5.3.3.1.2) on the noun jahpé,which can be used to refer to any of the things necessary for everyday life: food, clothes,utensils,     firewood,   artifacts,        hammocks,      etc. Its original      meaning—and         still its   mostfrequent one—is then ‘provide O with things’, ‘make O’s life possible by giving him/herall the necessary things’. A question that foreigners often hear after they come to a Tiriyévillage is: eeke anja mi-jahpénté-n? ‘How are you going to help us?’, ie. ‘What are yougoing to provide us with (in return for your stay here and our collaboration)?’. Old menhope that their children will jahpénté them in their old age. In a story, a young manpromised to an older one: é-jahpénté-keh-pin_me w-eh-ta-e ‘I will never stop helpingyou (=providing you with goods)’                (-ke(pf) ‘cessative’       [cf. 5.3.3.2.2], -pi(ni) ‘inefficient,incapable of nominalizer (cf. 4.2.2.2], wehtae ‘I will be’, future imperfective form of thecopula      e(i) [cf. 5.4.4]). However,             jahpénté      seems   to have       acquired   a more     general‘helping’ sense. In another story, an old man who could not move asked a young man tocarry him on his back by saying ki-jahpénté-ké ! ‘Help me!’ (cf. ex. (42), chap. 5). The

"          Class-changing           morphology          has     a more      intermediate    status.   There     are class-changing      affixes         that are very productive           and     very regular (e.g. verbal          nominalizers-to(po) ‘Circumstance’ [4.2.2.1.5], nominal adverbializers like t- -ke ‘Having’ [6.2.1.1.1]or i- -nna ‘Privative’ [6.2.1.2.1]); others, however, are quite unproductive (e.g. nominaladverbializers like t- -pore ‘Having a good N’ [6.2.1.1.2], nominal transitive verbalizers
                                                                                                                   127
 like the beneficiative -ma [5.3.3.1.2]). The verbal nominalizers are the most productive and regular of all; it is an interesting question whether or not it would be better toconsider them inflectional (marking e.g. ‘translational inflection’) and the less productive,more irregular class-changers derivational. This is certainly a point at which linguists ofdifferent theoretical orientations would disagree. However, for expository purposes, it issimpler to be able to speak of class-changing morphology                              (nominalizers, verbalizers,adverbializers)        as a whole,      and to describe them in the same               section,     regardless of thelevel of productivity and regularity of specific processes. Thus, in general, when a groupof morphological processes is more conveniently described as a single set, but has bothproductive/regular           and      unproductive/irregular           members,       it     will    be   consideredderivational.”","[147, 148]"

         The   absence     of /h/-initial syllables is as expected;           the other gaps,   however,    aremore surprising. The sequence /te/, which occurred in the text sample but did not in theword list, always includes a morpheme break (/t-/ ‘Rem.Pst’ + /e/-initial Sa verb; the /e/ islengthened if not followed by a tautosyllabic consonant (cf. 5.4.3.1.2)); the sequence /ti/,which did not occur at all, is found only in ideophones and in the collective suffix /-ti(D/.","[78, 79]"

"5.4.3.1.3. Negative forms.            Negative constructions        in Tiriy6 are copular clauses        with      a‘negative    adverbial’    verb   form    (cf.   10.3.5).    The   negative   form    has   a suffix   which     ishistorically derived from -se with the negative particle wa (cf. 8.1.4); the result is a verbalnegative suffix -sewa, which follows, for the first syllable, the allomorphic pattern of the

had been asked if he had seen two other people whom the speaker wanted to meet replied:

     t-see-se_Neg l:Agy
    ‘Thaven’t seen (them).’
   Some other cases of negative t- -se answers to questions have been collected. Their motivation remains
unknown.

The two suffixesthat characterize      these forms      are probably       old postpositions    (compare      the final wé      in-tuuwé with the derived locative postpositions in -wé / -o in 7.3.1.2; notice also the classmarker w-, typical of nominalizations,              in (128), which suggests that the verb form wasetymologically @-nominalized and used as the object of a postposition). Synchronically,however, it seems better to treat them as verbal suffixes, for the following reasons:5! The   ‘Actual S’-nominalized   form of ée(pi) also has an unexpected     t-: t-éeh-ke   ‘one who   comes’   (cf.
4.2.2.1.3). This t- is reminiscent of—but not identical with—the t- prefix of t-adding verb stems.

          (b) the alternative of considering -tuuwé and -tékéré as postpositions has problems:they cannot take nominal objects (e.g. *iré-tuuwé ‘after that’ and *iré-tékéré ‘because ofthat’, with the third-person anaphoric             pronoun         iré), and the verb stems occurring with-tuuwé and -tékéré do not seem to be nominalized, since they can reduce, and a possessed@-nominalized verb stem should not be able to reduce on account of the presence of thepossessive suffix -(ri) (compare (129a-b) with (129c), in which a @-nominalized syllable-reducing verb stem remains in its full grade with the Instrumental postposition _ke).(129a) i-ponoh-tuuwé _ ii-ja                                 (b)     i-ponoh-tékéré ii-ja

"         An      interresting   irregularity    is the case    of /éema/            ‘path,   way’.   Its   ‘0’   (non-possessed) form is /Eema/, and its third-person possessed form, /eema/; with the prefixes/k-/ ‘142’    and /t-/ ‘3R’, however,          a third form /ééma/ occurs (e.g. /k-E€ma/                   ‘our path,trail’). In other words,        /éema/ is the only noun        that has        two back grades         (/éema/    and/ééma/). >*4 Tt must be said, however, that the cases with /a/ as the front grade vowel are by far the most frequent.
* This is certainly related to the fact that the initial vowel in this word was an independent syllable at some
point in the past (Meira 1998a:180 reconstructs it as */ecema/). Apparently, the non-possessed form /éema/
is aremnant from this time; /ééma/ being probably the result of assimilation.

In addition to the ablaut described in the previous section,there is another allomorphic pattern, here called ‘syllable reduction’, which affects a highnumber of morphemes. Basically, this pattern relates allomorphs which differ only by onesyllable       (either the first or the last, here called the reducing    syllable),   and   which    areusually        (though   not always)    conditioned   by the form   of the adjacent syllables.       Theallomorphs in question are:           (1) the full (or CV) grade, in which the affected syllable appears in its full form;           (11) the reduced grades, of which there are two kinds:
           — the coda (or C) grade, in which the affected syllable is replaced with a singleconsonant, either /h/ or /n/, which becomes the coda of the preceding syllable;
           —     the length (or VV) grade,      in which the affected syllable is absent, but thepreceding vowel is lengthened (i.e. becomes a VV sequence);
           (iil) the zero (or @) grade, in which the affected syllable is absent, without            anyeffects on other parts of the stem.","[97, 98]"

Compare (88a), a Carib ofSurinam     example     (the   segmentation       and   glosses     were   added),    with   (88b),   its   Tiriy6equivalent:(88a)     ene:-ko!   nu:no n-o:ne-ya-@ !

In     Carib   of   Surinam,     the‘Extraspective’ form was found acceptable; in Tiriyé, however, the corresponding certaintyform was categorically rejected.

In Carib of Surinam, the extraspective form -take occurs; inTiriyo, several speakers have categorically denied the possibility of using the certainty formin this context. One speaker went so far as to claim that n-ee-ja-e and n-eh-ta-e should notbe used in (88b)      and (89b), but instead with the        1+3     pronoun     anja   to mean    ‘we arecoming’, ‘we will come’ (i.e. he immediately interpreted them as referring to anja, despitethe absence of any contextual clues). Thus, Tiriy6 apparently went further than Carib (inwhich, according to Hoff, third-person extraspective forms are difficult to obtain) in havingsimply   eliminated    the   certainty-doubt    opposition   in    the   third   person.   This   contrastsstrikingly with how easy it is to obtain contrasting pairs such as (90a-b), with the 1+3 form.(90a)    anja _ ni-té-e            pata_pona

         “Maybe we (1+3) will leave soon, I don’t know.’         For non-third persons, the Doubt form is used when the speaker is not sure whetheror not the event is taking place. It is thus the right form for questions (91la-d) and withdubitative particles such as tahke(ne)         ‘maybe’, or _mo     ‘irrealis’ (9le-f). Certainty formsare used when the event leaves no doubts in the speaker’s mind (91 g-h). In these cases, itdoes not seem that the speaker is trying to specify the source of his information concerningthe event, but rather to clarify doubts about it. For instance, in (91c), the speaker and the

The same is valid for (91d), where both speaker and hearer are going together to aneighboring village, but the speaker does not know the particular shortcut that the hearer istaking. Therefore, the Tiriy6 suffixes -e and -(né)/-(ne) apparently do not carry evidential(i.e. information source) meaning; rather, they concern how the speaker feels about his/herlevel of knowledge of the situation.(91a)   kure man-a-n ?

"For these elements, the question of whether or not they are affixes does not seem todepend on any substantive issues, but merely on how far the analyst is willing to push theunproductivity      and    irregularity scales          for affixes.

Sources of such cases are e.g. the ‘Augmentative’ suffix -imé, or the verbalintransitivizer prefix mentioned                in the previous section. Here the problem                 is that the“ Cf. Derbyshire 1985:205ff, in which the postpositions of a related language, Hixkaryana, are analyzed as
combinations of postpositional stems and various spacial suffixes; cf. also Tavares (pers. comm.), who
analyzes Wayana, another related language, in a similar way. In both cases, the degree of regularity seems
to be higher than in Tiriy6.

More divergent cases such as éiwa ‘to hunt’, from iwa‘to look for O’, will be treated as new roots (cf. 4.3.1.1 for further details, and for a list ofthe idiosyncratic cases found in the available corpus).

2. Lexical particles:(a) Independent particles, which usually consitute, by themselves, an utterance.      (a-1) Sentence equivalents are more clearly lexicalized; they are a quick means              to convey the speaker’s reaction to a given situation (‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘all              right’, etc.; cf. 9.2.1).      (a-2)     Interjections     tend to have      emotional     or dramatic         content;          they    are              frequently        onomatopoeic,      sometimes      including        sounds          or        sound              sequences not otherwise found in the language, and some of them seem              to be nonce creations (‘oh!’, ‘hm-hm’, etc.’; cf. 9.2.2).(b) Ideophones, though sometimes showing signs of an onomatopoeic origin, are      more conventionalized than interjections; they occur in constructions with the      Sa verb stem Ka ‘say’ with lexical meaning (‘sneeze’, ‘drizzle’, ‘joke’, etc.; cf.",[463]

         “Are you all really working?’         The particle _nara,       like _hkaté,      adds emphasis      to questions.    Interestingly, itcannot co-occur with a conjugated verb form (24e).!°'° This may result from _mara being a reflex of an older copular form *na with an element ra (possibly an
old particle). In 5.4.4, it was mentioned that Tiriy6 has retained only one third-person form of the copula,
_hai, while other Cariban languages have two or three. It may be the case that *ma is a remnant of another
one of these forms (cf. 8.1 for other possible remnants).

9.1.3.3. _to(o) ‘Collective’. The particle _to(o) is used to indicate that a third-personparticipant is collective. With transitive verbs, if one of the participants is a non-third-person (i.e. if an A- or an O-marking prefix is used), then _to(o) collectivizes the other(i.e. the third-person)      participant.   If both   participants       are third persons,    then _to(o)collectivizes the O participant. With intransitive verbs, _to(o) occurs only in the thirdperson form, indicating that the S is collective. This pattern is exemplified in 5.4.1.2above; here, only its form and syntactic status are discussed. The fact that _to behaves asa second-position clitic can be seen in (25a-d) (note in addition that _to(o) cannot occurclause-initially). (25c) also illustrates its length grade _too.!!

speakers as to whether or not this form was acceptable or even recognizable. Diachronically, it seems that
the original form actually was bisyllabic (cf. Gildea’s 1998:99 reconstruction of *toto to Proto-Carib), and
this may be the source of the observed long vowel in _to(o). Synchronically, the form toto seems to be, at
best, an archaism.

However, there are certain cases for which this explanation does not
                                                                                                            391work, since the nouns in questions are not possessed (24c-k). These instances provideevidence for an independent postposition _htao, conveying the idea of ‘being surrounded’by the object: in (24j),           Iam among the Wayana; in (24d), the meat is in direct contactwith the surrounding fire (which is not the case for the stew in (24f), hence the use of adifferent postposition); in (24k), being ‘in the forest’ can be seen as being ‘surrounded bythe     forest’   (notice   that   ‘in    the   village’,   ‘on the   island’    are   pata_po,   pau_po,   not*pata_htao,        *pau_htao, i.e. if the area is small enough to look more like a point than a‘surrounding’, _htao is not used); even in (24c), the stone is ‘surrounded by’ the garden(cf. (24h), in which _po puts the stone “by’ or ‘close to’ the garden; notice that _po wouldbe used if the speaker were                talking about a human         being rather than a stone). Thespeakers who were consulted could not distinguish (24e) from (24g); but this may bebecause the difference between being ‘surrounded’ by the ground and being ‘placed on it’(as ‘on a table’, in (24a) above) is not very noticeable. It is interesting to note that it wasnot possible to use _htao with one of the words for ‘table’, taafara (a borrowing,ultimately from Dutch tafel ‘table’): *taafara_htao                    was      corrected to taafara_po     (cf.(24a) above) or taafara_juuwé. Notice also the contrast between nono_tao                            ‘inside theearth’ (24i) and nono_htao               ‘on the ground’    (24e). In its conjugated form, _htao can beused to predicate possession (241); cf. also wenje in 7.3.2.

        The aquatic inessive postposition _hkao can only be used if the Ground is water(rivers, lakes, water in containers, etc.). With other liquids, there was some variation:according to some speakers, it was not possible to use _hkao              with munu       ‘blood’   (cf._htao in (25d)); for others, hkao        was possible if the blood was in a container, like water((25c); the question mark represents this variation). Apparently, _hkao (and also _po) canbe used with river names to indicate place; the consulted speakers could not differentiate(25d) from (25e).

7.3.1.1.2. Directionals. As a rule, the directional postpositions listed in Table 7.5 areequivalent to their locative counterparts (recognizable by their common                     initial element:po, t(a), hk(a), etc.), except for the fact that they indicate motion toward their object (theGround)     rather than static position with respect to it. Formally,                they are marked      by‘directional formatives’      (cf. 12.2) such as -na (for _poma), -(ka) for the others (notice

The   absence      of a temporaldirectional, which might have been *ma(ka), is noticeable. Its expected meaning, ‘until’,is actually expressed with _pona.","[408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415]"

          ‘S/he is coming behind me.’ (Lit. tofward] behind me)          The   postpositions      epoe     ‘above,     over’      and epiné     ‘under,     below’     are semanticopposites. Epoe implies lack of contact between the Figure and the Ground (46a). Itsfinal vowel       -e suggests     the perlative       element;      however,     like   (_)nkae,      the    connectionbetween     ‘above’     and   ‘perlative’    is hard to see. It is not clear that epoe                      is a derivedpostposition — in any case, no obvious source seems to exist. The same is true of epiné,which does not even end in any of the known formative elements. Both postpositions areincluded in this list, however, because of their directional form in -na(ka/kii). Epiné canbe semantically distinguished from anmao                   in that it does not imply that the Figure isnecessarily totally covered by the Ground                  ((46b); cf. anmao            in the previous         section,(46f)).

           The   demonstrative      pronouns    distinguish    visible   from   invisible   referents.   (7a)was uttered in a conversation in the speaker’s house to ask about the identity of someonewho was Singing in an adjacent room; (7b) was used to ask about the cause of a certainnoise (in this case, it was the noise made by the electricity generator of the village ofKuwamarasamutu).”          In both cases, the visible referent pronouns               were not acceptedinstead of the invisible referent ones. The reduced (zero) grade form mé of mé(ki) couldhave been      used in (7a), but it is not obligatory;        on the other hand,      the reduced     (coda)grade mén of mé(ni) is the usual form, with méni occurring only in emphatic situations,or when it is followed by a C(CV)-initial clitic (cf. 2.6.2 on syllable reduction).(7a)     aki      méki?

“ There are cases of nééré_ré, in which the particle _ré occurs twice. Although relatively rare, this
phenomenon occurs with other words as well (cf. 9.1.4 on _ré). However, there were no cases of *néré_ré;
this form (which would be pronounced [n9.¢54.¢3]) was consistently refused. There is no phonological or
phonotactic restriction in Tiriy6 that makes néré_ré impossible (compare e.g. the perfectly acceptable
combination of the medial inanimate demonstrative méré with _ré, méré_ré, pronounced (m3.¢54.r9]). Its
non-occurrence apparently results from the idiosyncratic realization of the sequence néré + _ré as nééré.
5 It seems that ‘hearability’ is an important factor in the use of mé(ki) and mé(ni); situations in which the
presence of a referent was noticed by means other than hearing (e.g. smell) produced inconsistent results.

The existence of three degrees is reminiscent of deictic systems ofsome European languages, which are based on person: proximal = close to first person,medial = close to second person, and distal = close to third person, or far away from thespeech              act    situation         (cf.   e.g.   Spanish   este,    ese,     aquel).     However,      the   Tiriyddemonstratives apparently depend on distance alone, not on person. (8a) was used by acharacter in a mythical                        narrative   to show   the way         to a different   village    to anothercharacter who did not know where it was; obviously, méré in this sentence cannot havesecond-person deixis, since the hearer is not yet there. (8b) was used by a speaker whowas watching the hearer taking notes in a notebook; se(ni) refers to the hearer’s writings,which were closer to the hearer than to the speaker.(8a)              méré_po           pai       i-pata

""’ Notice that nééré already corresponds to a combination of the third-person animate anaphoric pronoun néré
with the particle _ré (cf. 9.1.4), i.e. _ré ‘occurs’ twice in this example. In fact, some combinations involving
scope particles have lexicalized to varying degrees (cf. again 9.1.4, and also 6.1.1.4 on ke(ne) adverbs).

"10.2.1.1. Possessive Noun Phrases. These phrases occur in the order possessor-possessedwith the possessed word in its third-person form (i.e. with a prefix i- on consonant-initial> A similar argument can be used in favor of a ‘Causee” participant: just as the Dative participant correlates
with object nominalizations of -nté/-hté (beneficiative) verbs, causees correlate with transitive verbs
causativized with the suffix -po (cf. 10.6.2.3), in the sense that the immediate interpretation of a _: ja-phrase
co-occurring with a causativized verb is that of a causee. Notice, however, that there are no ‘Causee-oriented
nominalizations’, either from the postposition _:ja or from causativized verb stems, which weakens the claim
for a Causee   participant.    It seems   simpler to say that the ‘causee reading’   of _:ja-phrases      in transitive
sentences with causativized verb stems is a question of context, not unlike a ‘preferred directional (allative)
reading’ of _:ja-phrases co-occurring with verbs of motion (18a-b).

Furthermore,       the   possessive   suffix    -(ri)   (cf. 4.3.1.5)   can   occur   in the   N-Npossessive phrase (25d).(25a)      ma, ti-tunta-e,           mée,             wikapau pata_pona

        (26a) contains a regular N i-N possessive phrase, while (26b-c) have N-N phrases.(26d), however, suggests compounding: jaramata-pun looks like a single word for ‘chinflesh’. For this particular combination, the compound and the phrase options are bothavailable; in (26e-g), however, nka-pu(nu)                 ‘back flesh’ has only the compound option.®(26h-j) show a case of full lexicalization: not only is the N-N phrase option for nmapu(nu)impossible,     but     the   original    stem     *nma,         presumably         ‘behind’,   does    not      existsynchronically.

They are obviouslyderived from eta ‘bank, margin’ and enpata ‘face’. Etae is a true perlative, and describesmotion along e.g. a river bank (41a), and presumably also along other objects that haveedges or rims; unlike _tae, it cannot be used if the speaker is in a canoe. Empatae, on theother hand, is a locative; its few attestations were descriptions of the position of a certainhouse (41b), which was located on a hill slope. This may be interpreted as a metaphorbased on seeing the slope as the ‘face’ of the hill, which agrees with the use of (_)rehté,from reti ‘horns, antlers, top of the head’ (cf. next section), for a house located on the topof the hill.

(42a) describes a stone that is on top of an upside-down hemisphericgourd; (42b) refers to a house which is on the top of a hill (cf. the previous section, 41b,for a comparison with enpatae               ‘on the slope of’). When used with a person-markingprefix, _rehté refers to the head of the person in question (42c). The expression in (42d),literally ‘it’s on top of it’, means ‘it’s noon’; presumably, it refers to the sun being ‘on topof the    sky’   (which   can   be   seen    as   a head,    or     an   upside-down     gourd).

"     Tiriy6 was not the first language I studied, not even the first Amerindian one; but itwas the first that I examined       over a long period of time, both by reading the (rathermeager) literature and by going to places where it is the everyday language.

"       A still (but not so clearly) related meaning of this verb is that of ‘imitating’: taripiwi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate a taripi, a capuchin monkey’, said someone who wasabout to entertain his friends by mimicking a Cebus apella. This can be said about peopleas well: waijana wi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate a Wayana’, and also, waijana i-jomiwi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate the Wayana language’. Interestingly, the Tiriy6é alwaysuse the verb ku(ku) to refer to the capacity of speaking a foreign language; it is as thoughthe only language that one really speaks is one’s own mother tongue, while all the otherlanguages that one might know are ‘imitated’, no matter how well or fluently.

I-kuh-ké_pité ! ‘imitate it a little bit!’, i.e. ‘speak some of it (so that we can hearwhat it sounds like)’, he say after an affirmative answer: the Tiriy6, like most Amerindiangroups, are often curious about the languages of other people.","[622, 623]"

 member of the category designated by the stem (1la-d). The ‘former’, ‘ex-’ meaning is compatible with pronouns (lle-f). With possessed forms, the ‘old’, ‘no longer usable’ meaning is still possible, but a more frequent interpretation is that of past possession, i.e. something which used to belong or be related to the possessor. In this case, the word stilldesignates a member of the category in question; it is its relation to its possessor that is nolonger valid ((11g-i), with ji- ‘first person’). With a proper noun, the usual interpretationis ‘old’, ‘no longer existent’, ‘the one which used to be’ (cf. (11j), which was said of aphotograph of an old village, Araraparu, which was abandoned several decades ago).(lla)   maja          ‘knife’           —     miaja-npé     ‘old, worthless knife’

The use of -npé is justified bythe fact that the present-day ancestors of these children will certainly be dead in thedistant future, so that the ‘child(ren)-of’ relationship designated by munké will no longer

         The distribution of -npé and -hpé is discussed in detail in 4.3.1.5. Briefly, -hpéoccurs   on    possessed   (ri)-class   nouns,    while    -npé   occurs   elsewhere   (i.e. on possessed@-class nouns, and on all non-possessed nouns). Although there are a few exceptions,these are probably due to the ongoing disappearance of the possessive suffix -(ri).
                                                                                                         1634.2.1.2.     -imé   ‘Augmentative’.         This     suffix   derives   a noun    with   a larger,   or moreimpressive, or more threatening and scary referent than that of the original noun (14a-e;note that -imé becomes            -mé if the original stem ends in an i-diphthong; cf. 2.6.4). Inmany cases, imé-nouns have lexicalized to varying degrees (14f-j).(14a) pakoro          ‘house’         oe     pakoro-imé             ‘big house; building; chief's house’

This suffix derives a noun with a smaller, more fragilereferent than that of the original noun (15a-d). Affective overtones are possible (15e).(15a)      kaikui        ‘dog’        >        kaikui-pisi          ‘little dog, puppy’

4.2.1.4. -sepi ‘Predilective’. When it occurs on a possessed noun stem, -sepi indicatesthat it refers to something which the possessor particularly likes or prefers, somethingwhich he sees as good for him (17a-c). A possible context for (17a-b) is negotiation witha salesman. With the attributivizer postposition _me, -sepi reduces, forming -see_me(17a); in other contexts, -sepi occurs unreduced.(17a)    ji-majaa-sepi          /      ji-majaa-see_me

         which_Ptc  3:meat.food-Prdl
         “But what could his favorite (meat) food be?’         On non-possessed noun stems, some speakers did not allow the occurrence of-sepi. Others, however, accepted it with a generic meaning (‘which everybody likes orneeds, which would be useful for anyone’). The question marks in (18) represents thisvariation.(18a) ? maja-sepi                             (b) ? pakoro-sepi

It would be interesting to investigate if a historical connection isplausible.
4.2.1.5. -ripi ‘Pejorative’. This suffix derives a noun stem with a referent that is a ‘bad’,‘flawed’, ‘inefficient’ member of the category labeled by the original noun stem.(19a)   maja                 ‘knife’           —     maja-ripi          ‘a bad knife (a dull one)’
(b)     ji-pawana ‘my friend’                  -~    ji-pawana-ripi     ‘a bad friend’            Unlike the past suffix -npé (cf. 4.2.1.1), which designates a referent that no longerbelongs to the category, -ripi marks a noun that still refers to a member of the category,although it performs poorly. Thus, maja-npé is ‘something which used to be a knife’ butnow is not a member of this category anymore, while maja-ripi is ‘a bad, dull knife’, andthus still a member, albeit very imperfect, of the category.","[179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186]"
"      A final word to you, the Reader, the ultimate goal of this work. If this grammar,inconclusive though it may be (hence the ‘first’ in the title), still ends up being a source ofvaluable information for you, then my goals will have been fulfilled. If you also happen toenjoy reading it—who knows, this world is full of all kinds of people, including thosewho like Cariban languages—, then I will be happy. For I will think that someone elsehas   managed     to understand   the joy and     satisfaction   that my    forays   into the Tiriyédlanguage have brought me. Etiam homo sum.

The Tiriy6 people number around2,000, living in various villages on both sides of the Brazilian border, close to theTumucumaque (Tumuc-Humac) mountains, in lowland South America (cf. Maps 1and 2).

"          In the introduction, a major subdivision was made between particles that can standalone (independent particles, including sentence equivalents and interjections) and thosethat usually do not (ideophones). Functionally speaking, sentence equivalents stand out ashaving     no     traceable     relationship      to   onomatopoeia          or    sound     symbolism         (with   theexception       of aha    ‘yes’; cf. below).           As    for interjections        and ideophones,           they aresometimes very similar in meaning, and the border between them is far from beinghermetic. Ideophones are, more often than not, accompanied by one of the forms of the

However, almost any word can, albeit infrequently, co-occur withka;    this   includes       interjections.     Often   enough,     these    are   instances   of indirect   speech(‘Ouch!’,      he   said),     but     there   are borderline     cases,    especially   among    sound   symbolicparticles and animal sounds: the fact that e.g. tfapan ‘sticking’ and koron ‘toad noise’were only found by themselves in the available corpus while manan ‘lightning’ and siri,sirin ‘cricket noise’ co-occurred with ka may have been a spurious conincidence. Incertain cases, however, there is a clear preference: bodily functions (pito ‘spit’, tonton‘cough’ etc.) almost always co-occur with ka, while certain interjections (tee ‘surprise’,péé ‘concern’) almost never do, and even these occurrences are usually indirect speech.","[501, 502]"

        From the formal viewpoint, it is noteworthy that most of the verbalizers (except -ka,-ke(pi), and -wa) can be divided into pairs with a nasal and a non-nasal member: -hté/-nté,-pa/-ma, -ta/-na, and -pa(mi)/-ma(mi). Such pairings are reminiscent of the nominal pastsuffixes -hpé and -npé, which are distributed according to possessed noun classes: -hpéoccurs on possessed -ri class nouns, -npé on possessed -@ class nouns or on non-possessednouns (cf. 4.3.1.5.1). Unfortunately,           a similar distribution does not seem to hold for theverbalizers: nouns of both classes can be found with any verbalizer, nasal or non-nasal (cf.the examples        in the following        subsections).      Although     one   may       speculate    that some

"4.2.2.2, 6.2.1.2). These words are adverbs or nouns, used just like any other members ofthese classes.         —      non-verbal:   this   is the case of negation       by means   of the particles _ta(ike)‘negative’ and _wa(a) ‘negative existential’ (cf. 9.1.4), which take the preceding phrase astheir ‘scope’;         — verbal: this is the case of negative clauses built around the negative verbal form(cf. 5.4.3.1.3);         — polar:      this is the case of the negative sentence-equivalent particle owa               ‘no,nothing, nobody’ (cf. 9.2.1).",[577]
"5.3.3.1.1. The privative verbalizer -ka. From any noun root N, a               transitive verb meaning‘deprive O of N’ can be derived with the privative suffix -ka. (37) shows a ka-verb used ina sentence; further examples are in (38).(37)        ji-nmuku wi-po-ka-e

          A relation with the transitivizer -ka, used with           syllable-reducing    So stems   (cf.5.3.1.2), is perhaps not impossible, but seems hard to justify.             A more obvious connectioncan     be made    with the transitive    stem   ka   ‘remove   O’, which   is the obvious   diachronic

However, it is not‘dead’ morphology, since it can be used on new stems (in (43d), wini ‘trick’ is a relatively

6 Th one case, however, the reverse was observed: the verb stems eka-hté ‘name O, give O a name’, and eka-
nté ‘indicate O, show where O is’, from eka ‘name’. It would be interesting to check the semantics of nté-
verbs corresponding to all the hté-verbs in (43).

There arealso in the corpus three verbs ending in -hté (erahté ‘find O’, amohté ‘call O’, ehté ‘thinkabout O, plan O’); they may turn out to be derived from older, perhaps no longer extantnoun roots.           (44) and (45) are exhaustive lists of the clear cases of the verbalizers -ma and -pa inthe     available   corpus     (wapo-no          ‘first one’     and   epona-n     ‘one   who   believes’         are   thenominalized form of the postposition wapo                       ‘before, in front of’ and epona            ‘fidelitive’);there may be others, among the verb stems ending in ma (e.g. ekarama                               ‘give O’, aarama‘ado       O’,   erekonma        ‘harass   O’,     etc.),   but further research      is necessary        to determinewhether or not they have synchronic nominal sources.","[291, 292, 293, 294]"
"            From the semantic viewpoint, there are certain tantalizing similarities between thetransitive and intransitive verbalizers. All of them concern the relationship between one ofthe participants of the derived verb stem (O or S) and the source noun (N), in a ‘negative’(‘depriving’, ‘ceasing’) or ‘positive’ (‘giving’, ‘having/getting’) manner. If the parallelismswere perfect, one might say that the transitive verbalizers are close to being causativeversions of the intransitive verbalizers: the ‘positive’ beneficiative suffixes -hté/-nté and-pa/-ma      would      describe the action of ‘giving N to O’, while the ‘positive’                               inchoativesuffixes      -ta/-na      (-wa)      and    -pa(mi)/-ma(mi)        would      correspond          to      the     event    of‘producing/getting N’; the              ‘negative’   privative suffix -ka would indicate                    the action of‘taking N away from O’, while the ‘negative’ cessative -ke(pi) would express the idea of‘losing N’, ‘not having N anymore’. There are, however, details which deviate from thisparallelism:     -ke(pi),     for instance,     is much   less productive          on nouns         than     -ka, and itsmeaning       does   not     really    imply   ‘being   deprived’     as    much     as    ‘ceasing         to     function’,‘stopping’; moreover, it is more frequently used with verb stems. In addition, though thedistinction between          -ta/-na    and -pa(mi)/-ma(mi)         roughly     correlates        with   the distinctionbetween -hté/-nté and -pa/-ma (e.g. both -pa/-ma and -pa(mi)/-ma(mi) occur on ‘moreabstract’    noun    roots    like emu(ku)       ‘sadness’,   akunu        ‘laziness’,    etc.,    while         -ta/-na   andhté/-nté occur on ‘more concrete’ roots), the overlap is imperfect at best (e.g. nmuu-ma‘impregnate O’, from nmuku                  ‘son’, corresponds not to *nmuh-pa(mi), but to nmubh-ta,

Although Table             5.8 still looks   suggestive,   and may    haveconsequences for diachronic studies, it seems that, in present-day Tiriyd, the exact processused to verbalize a noun root is, to a large extent, an idiosyncratic lexical matter.","[290, 291]"
