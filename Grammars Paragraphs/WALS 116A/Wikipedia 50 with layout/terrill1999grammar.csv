17.1.2 A NSWERS TO POLAR QUESTIONSPolar questions can be phrased both positively and negatively, as the examples above
have shown. Positive answers to positive polar questions are expressed by iire ÔyesÕ.
Negative answers to positive questions are expressed by tamu ÔnoÕ. The particle comes
first, in its own sentence intonation unit, then a longer sentential answer may follow.
For example the answer to the question in (2) Is it here you want to stay? is as follows:
                                                   409
                                         17 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATION6)     ""Tamu.              Kanifa                    mail           koi"".
       tamu                kanifa                    mail           koi
       no                  along.a.bit               a.bit          also
       ""No. A bit further again"".                                                  b1 030Questions phrased positively are neutral as to whether they expect a positive or negative
answer. However questions phrased negatively expect a positive answer. For example
the question in (4) above The giant here didnÕt eat you? was asked when a boy
reappeared in his village after a long absence. The village people had assumed he had
been eaten by the giant, but seeing him they realised he must not have been, and thus
asked the question knowing that it would receive a positive answer: the giant had not
eaten him. The boyÕs answer is as follows:7)     Tamu.     Ngaulam                         fin.
       tamu      nga- u -la              -m      fin
       no        1sgO- eat -NEG          -sgm    3sgmFOC
       No. He didn't eat me.                                                      mn2 058As the example shows, positive answers to negative questions are expressed with the
negative particle.","[435, 436]"
"Even though negative questions expect a positive answer, it is possible to give a
negative answer to a negative question. This is done using a particle oman Ôon the
contraryÕ. A negative answer to the above question (Q: The giant didnÕt eat you? A:
The giant ate me (which would only make sense if the boy was now a ghost for
example)) could be expressed in the following way, using oman and a positive
sentence:8)     Oman.             Bagatum            na     oum                fongai.
       oman              bagatum            na     o-        u   -m   fongai

       On the contrary, the giant did eat me.                                      e4 018a
17.1.3 CONTENT QUESTIONS USING THE HEO FOCUS MARKERContent questions are those which expect a content word or words as an answer. It was
shown in Section 11.7 that if a content question employs a focus construction, the focus
marker used will be the heo focus marker. The heo focus marker in questions works as
in focus constructions, but the element it is questioning is the element it expresses focus
on, using the agreement system outlined in Chapter 11.",[436]
"The first part of this chapter discusses the syntactic structures used to express questions,
and also all the interrogative lexical items in the language. It also discusses how positive
and negative polar questions are answered. The second part of the chapter presents a
discussion of all aspects of negation, including the role of the focus markers in negative
clauses. The morphological, syntactic and pragmatic features of focus constructions are
discussed in Chapter 11.",[433]
"The sole use of the meo focus marker, then, is in marking focus in polar questions.
Content questions usually use a question word, usually with a focus marker. If the focus
marker is present, it is heo, and it agrees with the questioned item. The following
sections discuss in turn polar questions and then content questions.",[434]
"
17.1 QUESTIONSIn Lavukaleve, questions are very often phrased using a focus construction. There are                                              407
                                       17 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATIONalso a number of question words which may be used, either in a focus construction or
not. All questions are marked, not only by syntactic and lexical means, but also by a
distinctive rising intonation. Questions can be divided into two functional and syntactic
types: polar questions and content questions.","[433, 434]"
"
17.2.4 TAMU ÔNOTÕThe particle tamu negates an entire clause or an NP. It appears postposed to a positive
clause and negates the proposition of that clause, or, as discussed above, it provides an
answer to a negative question. The difference between using a tamu construction and
using the verbal suffix -la or tave Ôbe notÕ, which have the same propositional effect,

                                            17 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATIONappears to be a stylistic one; in texts, particular speakers tend to favour one or the other.","[445, 446]"
"
17.1.1 P OLAR QUESTIONSPolar questions are framed using a focus construction involving the meo focus marker,
with the focus marker agreeing with the questioned element. Since questioned elements
are focussed, by definition, one would expect questions to be expressed using morpho-
syntactically marked focus in a language in which this is available, and this is indeed
what happens in Lavukaleve. Some examples (there are many more in Section 11.7):Questioning an NP:
1)     Vo'voul                  honalari                      minal?

Section 17.1.2 explains how the answers to these and other questions are phrased.","[434, 435]"
"As was shown in Section 11.7, there are three focus markers in Lavukaleve: feo, the
default focus marker; meo, the focus marker used in polar questions; and heo, the focus
marker used, among other things, in content questions. See the above-mentioned
chapter for a full discussion of the focus markers and their syntactic and semantic
functions.",[434]

Questions and negation
This chapter takes as its starting point the semantic fields of questions and negation and
looks at the kinds of constructions used to express them. The expression of questions
and negation in Lavukaleve involves some use of focus constructions, as well as other
syntactic strategies not involving morphologically-marked focus.","[431, 432, 433]"

17.1.4 CONTENT QUESTIONS USING INTERROGATIVE LEXICAL ITEMSContent questions are often phrased in focus constructions using specific interrogative
lexical items. These interrogative words belong to various word classes, and thus have
different syntactic properties. The full list is as follows:WORD              GLOSS                     WORD CLASS

riahi~diahi       Ôwhere to?Õ               particleContent questions generally appear as the first word of the clause, although they can
appear elsewhere in the clause. In particular the intransitive verb vasia Ôbe whereÕ
frequently appears clause-finally, as other verbs do. The following sections exemplify
                                                          411

"Questions are expressed in one of two main ways: either by using a specific question-
word, or by just using a focus construction. Even those clauses using specific question
words are frequently expressed using focus constructions.",[433]
"Stress shift rules such as those described above can be utilised; if it is possible to put the
word in question into a construction in which a stress shift rule will apply, one can then
discern whether the syllable in question still sounds long (in which case it is an instance

"If a speaker does not know the gender of a referent, they can either avoid agreement, or,
they can use question words like man ÔwhatÕ; ami ÔwhoÕ and elahave Ôhow muchÕ, in
which case gender is syntactically assigned, because these question words are masculine
nouns. Thus:19)     Man           hin?

·     Heo as the second focus marker of a focus-echo constructionHeo is also used as the second focus marker in a construction described above (Section
11.5.1) as a focus-echo construction. Constructions of this type are argument focus
constructions, with the added feature that as well as having a focus marker in construction
with the focussed argument, inside the sentence, they also have a second focus marker,
agreeing with the same argument, at the end of the sentence. It was suggested above that
this kind of construction expresses particularly strong argument focus.","[310, 311]"

3.14 ROI ~DOI ÔWHICH?ÕThere is a word roi~doi Ôwhich?Õ (the forms vary freely; see Section 2.10), a question
word, which forms its own word class, on the basis of its morpho-syntactic properties. It
functions as the head of an NP, so one might want to call it a noun, but there are two
reasons that this is not an appropriate classification. Firstly, it is a criterial feature of
nouns that they have their own inherent gender. Roi does not, but instead takes its
gender from the word whose status it is questioning. Secondly, it can appear in an NP in
apposition with, and before, this noun which it is questioning. Nouns do not do this; two
nouns in the same NP must normally appear in a head-modifier relationship, using the
possessive construction (see Section 4.2 for discussion of this). The fact that roi can
appear in apposition with a noun means that it is not a noun. The fact that it appears
before, not after, this noun, means that it could not possibly be modifying this noun;
modifiers invariably follow, not precede, their heads. For these reasons, roi is not
considered a noun or an adjective, but instead is considered to belong to its own word
class.",[85]
"Note that the focus marker does not move to the initial position in questions; rather, it
remains in the position in which it would be if the sentence were not a question. There

is the only example of such ellipsis in the corpus. It is not clear whether the possibility
is to do with the fact that the sentence is a question.",[435]
"Focus is a central part of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax. It is heavily grammaticalised into
clause structure, and extremely frequent in discourse. Roughly one third of all clauses
have some kind of grammatical focus construction. Any constituent can be focussed,
including NPs, postpositional phrases and other nominal adjuncts, adverbs, predicates
(either just a verb, or a verb with its object), subordinate clauses, the lexical part of a
complex predicate, or indeed whole sentences. There are two different kinds of
syntactic focus construction, one with the verb in a special form, used to mark focus on
predicates (verb plus object) or whole sentences, and one without this special verb form,
used for focussing on arguments, adjuncts and non-main verbal forms. In both
construction types, focus is marked by special particles, which occur immediately after
the focussed constituent and show agreement in person, gender and number. The scope

                                       1 - I NTRODUCTIONof the focus is indicated by the agreement of the focus marker. There are three separate
paradigms of focus markers, which differ in terms of the sentence type with which they
occur. One is used only in polar questions; one in content questions and environments
expressing particular kinds of emphasis; the third is used elsewhere.","[39, 40]"
"
11.2 MORPHOLOGY AND SYNTAX OF THE FOCUS MARKERSThe focus markers are independent words which form their own word class. The three
focus markers each form a paradigm of suppletive forms marked for person, gender and
number. The three different focus markers are meo, heo and feo (cited throughout in
their 3rd person singular feminine form). Each one is used for a different sentence type.
Meo is used in polar questions. Heo is used in certain syntactic environments such as
information questions, or where there is a demonstrative pronoun foia in the clause, or as
the second focus marker in a focus-echo construction. Heo can also be used to express
strong emphasis; this use of heo rather than feo or meo is not obligatory (unlike the
others), but a pragmatic choice made by a speaker for a certain effect. The third focus
marker, feo, is the unmarked one; it has the widest distribution and the least constraints
on its use. It is used in all situations where grammatical focus is to be expressed, apart
from those using heo or meo. In this sense, feo can be viewed as the default focus
marker.",[274]

the other is to express strong emphasis. There are some syntactic environments which
require the use of heo. These environments are: content questions, the second focus
marker of a focus-echo construction, focus clauses which contain a foia demonstrative
pronoun, and focus clauses in which a constituent is emphasised using the emphatic
particle ta. In these environments, if any focus marker is used it must be heo rather than
meo or feo. In other environments, heo may be used to express strong emphasis. This
is particularly the case with contrastive emphasis, which is almost always expressed using
heo. For this pragmatic purpose, feo may be always used instead of heo, but if it is, the
strong emphasis reading associated with heo will be lost.","[309, 310]"

Sentence focus is also used in situations where something happens counter to
expectations. In the next sentence the speaker has just been startled by an arrow landing
next to her with no warning, and then is further surprised to see the addressee, who had
sneaked up behind her. She asks the question, expressing surprise that the man in front of
her might own the arrow, although it is clear that she had no expectation of who the
owner is (so this isnÕt contrastive focus):25)    ""Tumai, i n u      ta     mina         onuvem            hin?""

obey their chiefs, and contrasting that with the perceived disobedience in villages now.
He uses sentence focus in this sentence for a strong statement, that those people then
obeyed the chiefsÕ word, which makes an explicit contrast with the people of today. The
speaker is talking to an audience of younger people, and he is perhaps slightly defensively
making a strong point, using the marked sentence focus construction, to achieve this.",[286]

APPENDIX 1: texts
Punctuation conventions are as follows. A numbered chunk of text is an intonation group
plus extra-prosodic afterthoughts which are syntactically and/or semantically linked. Full-
stops indicate sentence-final intonation. Commas represent a pause after a rise in pitch.
Slashes represent a pause after level pitch. Exclamation marks indicate prosodically
prominent elements inserted into the intonation contour. Question marks indicate question
intonation. Double quotes indicate direct speech, which may be pronounced in a different
voice than the rest of the text.","[465, 466, 467]"

3.7 THE FOCUS MARKERSThere are three paradigms of focus markers, which are marked for person, gender and
number of a particular element of the constituent with which they are in construction5.
The three stems themselves have different pragmatic meanings as follows: the meo
focus marker is used in polar questions; the heo focus marker is used in information
questions, in clauses containing the demonstrative pronoun foia, and to mark strong
emphasis; and the feo focus marker is used elsewhere, in other contexts in which focus
is marked (the focus markers are cited in their 3rd person singular feminine forms here).
The focus markers have the following features:·      they each form a paradigm marked for person, gender and number and they can take
       no further morphological affixation
·      they do not function as the head of a clause; that is, they have no arguments of their
       own
·      they can occur in construction with NPs, adjuncts, verbs or entire sentences
·      they are always constituent-finalThe syntactic, morphological and pragmatic functions of the focus markers are
discussed in Chapter 11. The paradigms are given in that chapter.",[82]
"There are various ways to negate different kinds of constituents: including the Negative
verbal suffix -la, the particle tamu ÔnoÕ; the intransitive verb tave Ôbe notÕ; the negative
imperative expressed by the Admonitive suffix; and other negative lexical items.
Frequently, negative predications are expressed using a focus construction. The use of
focus constructions in the areas of questions and negation is a very characteristic feature
of Lavukaleve, and indeed of other languages which have grammaticalised focus
structures.",[433]
"
WHO, WHAT AND HOW MUCHThe question words ami ÔwhoÕ, man ÔwhatÕ and elahave Ôhow muchÕ are all masculine
nouns. They function as the heads of NP, and as arguments of verbs, and take masculine
agreement. They cannot however be modified.",[438]
"Derived nouns have the following nominal features: they function as the heads of NPs,
and can thus appear with the definite article, they serve as arguments of verbs or
postpositions, and they may take the Locative suffix. The question of whether or not they
can take Possessive prefixes is a slightly complicated one, which requires some
discussion.",[345]
"
2.10 ALTERNATIVE REALISATIONSThere are some examples of alternative pronunciations of certain words. These
alternative realisations all involve interchange between different phonemes of the
language. That is, the alternations neutralise the distinction between otherwise
independent phonemes. However, being lexically constrained, and also being optional,
it is never the case that ambiguity arises through the neutralisation of these phonemes in
the words in which it occurs. In each case, I have written the words in question with
their most common pronunciation. The words are:/d/~ /r/    ria            ['dia] ~ ['ria]                   Ôwhere to?Õ
            roi            ['doi] ~ ['roi]                   Ôwhere?Õ
            raine          ['daine] ~ ['raine]               ÔtomorrowÕNote that the /d/ ~ /r/ alternation only occurs in the words initial position. The word
raine also occurs in the word iruraine ÔdailyÕ. In this case the pronunciation can only
be:            iruraine       ['iru'raine]                      ÔdailyÕ
/b/ ~ /v/   beko           ['beko] ~ [ºeko]                  ÔstoneÕ
            vuli           ['buli] ~ ['ºuli]                 ÔbehindÕ/n/ ~ /l/   mulukuita       ['munu'kuita] ~ ['mulu'kuita]    ÔmosquitoÕ
            halangas       ['hana'÷as] ~ ['hala'÷as]         ÔcoralÕThese alternations are all a generationally-based phenomenon. Younger people, in their
twenties or younger, tend to pronounce /d/, /b/ and /n/ in certain words where older
people consistently pronounce /r/, /v/ and /l/ respectively. This is not a universal
generational sound change, but rather is lexically constrained.",[64]

               -> [d] elsewhereLike the other voiced stop /b/, /d/ is often prenasalised between vowels. The phoneme
/d/ is very rare; it appears in only 13 words in the corpus, three of which are obvious
recent loans from Pijin. The words are:daeva             ÔgogglesÕ (cf. Pijin daeva)
dis               ÔbowlÕ (cf. Pijin dis)

de                Ôhere!Õ (Presentational particle)
hide              ÔthusÕIt is considered a phoneme because there are minimal pairs contrasting /d/ and the
closest phonemes to it, /t/ and /r/ (see below, Section 2.4). It does occur in function
words, for example question words doi ÔwhichÕ; dia ÔwhereÕ; however in these words it
freely alternates with /r/. This alternation between /r/ and /d/ is lexically constrained; it
only occurs in a small group of question and time words, and never in any other words
containing /r/ or /d/. The alternation between /r/ and /d/ is discussed in Section 2.10
below.","[43, 44]"
"FoleyÕs (1991) response to a similar question in Yimas (in situations where a
pronominal prefix does not occur but an NP does) is to argue that there is in fact a zero
pronominal prefix there, holding the core argument slot. However I am reluctant to posit
zero pronominal prefixes where there is no direct evidence for them.",[240]
"
THE FEO FOCUS MARKERFeo is the ÒelsewhereÓ focus marker; that is, it is used in all contexts where a focus
marker is needed but the conditions are not appropriate for meo or heo. It is used in
statements, not in questions, and in clauses in which there is no foia demonstrative
pronoun, and where there is no strong emphasis. Examples have occurred frequently
throughout this chapter, and more need not be repeated here.",[318]
"The Presentative suffix -ri derives a presentative form of a deictic, something like the
French voilˆ. Presentatives also occur in languages closer to the Solomons, for example
in Maybrat, a West Papuan Phylum language (Dol 1998). Presentatives are described by
Anderson and Keenan as demonstratives Òwhich are used to indicate an itemÕs location
or to signal its appearance in (or relative to) the observational field of the Sp[eaker]Ó                                                     188

what is here described as a presentative demonstrative:
        A Sentential Demonstrative ... is a demonstrative that can stand alone as a sentence,
        having what can be called a Presentative function. These are sentences whose meanings
        are something like ÔBehold!Õ or maybe ÔLook at this!Õ. Latin ecce, French voilˆ, Serbo-
        Croatian evo, are examples of Sentential Demonstratives. Often a noun or pronoun
        indicating the object being presented occurs in construction with a Sentential
        Demonstrative, as in French Le voilˆ, Serbo-Croatian Evo ga, both meaning ÔHere he
        isÕ. (1982: 47)This is the most common pragmatic function of LavukaleveÕs Presentative suffix 4.
There are a couple of other related functions associated with this suffix. If a deictic is
used on its own as a single-word utterance, as, for instance, the answer to a question
where? or how?, it must appear with the Presentative suffix. For example, in showing
someone how to do something, an action will be accompanied by the single-word
utterance:87)     Akari!
        aka    -ri
        then5  -PSNV

"These question words still take masculine agreement even when their referent is known
to be feminine. Consider for example the following sentence, in which man ÔwhatÕ,

issues. This section attempts to make some generalisations about dual and plural
formation. It also points to some caveats about the extent to which these phenomena can
be analysed as rule-governed and the extent to which they must be seen as
unpredictable. This is particularly the case with respect to the phenomenon of the
masculine singular and feminine singular suffixes, which has been mentioned above,
but which needs further discussion. Also of particular interest are how borrowed words
behave under dual and plural formations; the phenomenon of multiple dual/plural
formation strategies for the same noun; homonyms; and the question of nouns which are
always plural, and have no singular or dual forms.","[139, 140]"
"The fourth part of the thesis deals with interclausal syntax: clause chaining constructions
(Chapter 15) and subordinate clauses (Chapter 16). There are three types of subordinate
clauses; one of them, subordinate adverbial clauses, involves a split-ergative marking
system. Most other areas of the language have nominative/accusative alignment. The final
part of the thesis, discourse organisation, aims to bring together some of the broader areas
of importance to Lavukaleve discourse. The expression of questions and negation is
described in Chapter 17. In Chapter 18 is a discussion of typical Lavukaleve ways of
structuring discourse in narratives for textual cohesion, and an examination of how
reference tracking devices operate across a larger section of narrative than a single
sentence.",[10]

15.5 CLAUSE CHAINING IN OTHER PAPUAN LANGUAGESOne might not expect necessarily to find structural similarities between Lavukaleve and
other Papuan languages; the term Papuan, after all, simply means that the language in
question is from a certain region of the world and is not Austronesian. Nevertheless,
constructions very similar to the one described in this chapter are very characteristic of
mainland Papuan languages, and it is worthwhile to look at how LavukaleveÕs clause
chaining constructions compare with clause chaining constructions in other languages.
Such constructions are not at all characteristic of the Oceanic languages surrounding
Lavukaleve.",[406]

contrast.","[292, 293]"
