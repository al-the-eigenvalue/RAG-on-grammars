"    If the answer is not heard and the essential components of the question
are repeated, the question-word has a high-fall, whilst the final syllable of
the accompanying verb carries a rise (ràt'om mi-(Ø-)di-x-á+r? 'Why are
you going (sc. did you say)?', vin ga-(Ø-)a-k'et-á? 'Who did it (sc. did you
say)'). If an interruption is made using an interrogative only, then that
interrogative carries high-falling pitch (A: london-ši mi-v-di-v-a+r. B:
sàd(a)? 'A: I am going to London. B: Where?'). Yes-no questions take a
rise-fall on the final syllable of the verb, which will regularly be the final
word of the sentence—the presence of this pitch causes a concomitant

[midixáàr] 'Are you going?'). Tag-questions are characterised by a high-
falling pitch on the verb's stressed syllable (e.g. xom mV(0-)di-x-a+r?
'You are going, aren't you?', xom ar rni-(0-)di-x-a+r? 'You aren't going,
are you?'). Alternative questions have high-falling pitch on the negative
element in the second part of the question (e.g. mi-(0-)di-x-a+r tu ara?
= mi-(0-)di-x-a+r tu àr mi-(0-)di-x-a+r? 'Are you going or not
(going)?').","[48, 49]"
"3.6. Particles    (na+c'il+ak'-eb-i)3.6.1 Interrogative Particles
Though OldGEORGIANformed 'Yes-No' questions by means of the clitic
particles -a and -me, the modern literary language does not (cf. 5.1.13.1),
though some mountain-dialects still employ -a.
    Leading questions expecting the answer 'yes' contain xom, those
expecting the answer 'no' contain xom ar/ver (cf. 5.1.13.4).
    An element of surprise is introduced into a question by means of either
of the particles gana or nu+tu (cf. 5.1.13.5).
    We have seen the particle -ga used with interrogative pronouns to
lend them the nuance of 'pray, on earth' (cf. 3.5.3). Less restrictedly such a
nuance can be provided by such particles as gana,                      nu+tu,
vi+to+m/mitam, net'a(v(i)), e.g.     gana ra                ča-v-(Ø-)i-d-in-e            i+s+e+t-i?

The second alternative, either a full clause or just the negative ara 'not',
is introduced by tu 'or'. The verb in the first clause has rising intonation,
whilst the second verb (or the negative ara) carries falling pitch, e.g.   bag-s         mo-(Ø-Ø-)rc'q'-av               tu    jroxa-s

falling pitch on the verb, e.g.      xom       lamaz-i-a              sa+kart+v+el+o?

      'Surely Georgia is beautiful/Georgia is beautiful, isn't it?'    leading questions expecting the answer 'no' have this same particle in

There is a great variety of strategies available to convey a fear. Perhaps
the simplest way to express a positive fear is to use the appropriate tense
of the indicative, preferably accompanied by the speech-particle and also
by either vai-tu 'woe if' or xom ar 'surely not?', e.g.     m-e-šin-i-a,       vai-tu rus-eb-i
     I-IOV-fear-PRES-it          Russian-Pl-NOM
     šmo-gv-e-s-ev-i-an(=me+tk+i)

       PRES                               AOR
   'I am afraid that the Russians will attack us // may be attacking us //
   may have attacked us'which may be alternatively expressed by replacing vai-tu by xom ar
placed after the SUBJect rus-eb-i. These two variants, which are based
on direct quotation, sit happily alongside any tense in the introductory
verb, so that replacing m-e-šin-i-a above by the past m-e-šin-od-a
would give the equivalents of 'I was afraid the Russians would attack us //
were attacking us // had attacked us'.
    An alternative is to turn the fearing clause into a negative wish (sc.
that something may not happen or may not be happening), which joins the
negative particle ar to the appropriate SUBJunctive (viz. Aorist for an
event in the future vs Prešent for one contemporaneous with the fear).
Such expressions may optionally be introduced by the complementiser rom
and optionally accompanied by the relevant speech-particle. The above-
example in this variation would be:   m-e-šin-i-a,     (rom)                    rus-eb-i           ar

moment the fear itself is being expressed. In the case of a simple fear for
the future after a non-past main verb the Future Indicative, with or
without rom, is possible, e.g.      m-e-šin-i-a, (rom) rus-eb-i še-mo-gv-e-s-ev-i-an

"5.1.13 Questions
5.1.13.1 Yes-No'
Questions of this type involve no movement of words but are signalled
entirely by the application of the appropriate intonation-pattern, namely a
rišfalling pitch on the final syllable of the verb, which will normally be
the last word in the šentence.",[584]
"2.2.2 Phonetic realisation of vowelsThe five vowels are short, though there is secondary lengthening under the
influence of the rise-fall pitch that marks a yes-no question (see 2.4.2).
Sequences of vowels are pronounced as such, so that there are always as
many syllables per word as there are vowels (e.g. ga-a-advil-eb 'you will
facilitate X/them' is the five-syllable [gaaadvileb]).
    Sonants in consonant-complexes have no syllable-forming capacity.",[41]
"5.1.13.6 Questions with raising
Questions of the type 'Who do you think will gain the victory?', which

The sequence ma+s še+m+deg,                 ra+c (literally 'after    it, which')
introduces an indicative verb, e.g.    ma+s še+m+deg, ra+c            šen     ga-x-ved-i,

    'After you went out, the teacher fainted'   The allied notion of 'since + Past Tense Verb' is conveyed by the same
construction, though the postposition še+m+deg may be replaced by
uk'an 'behind' or by a+k+et 'on this side, over here', whilst the first two
words of the pseudo-conjunctional complex may yield to the phrase i+m
dro-i+dan 'from that time', e.g.      i+m dro-i+dan, ra+c            šen    mi-(Ø-)m-a-t'ov-e,

      'Since the time you left me 1 have been going around like a ghost'   The English concatenation of 'since' with the Progressive Perfect is
rendered simply by the use of ra+c, which is optionally omissible, with the
Prešent Indicative, e.g.      otx-i     c'el-i-a,      (ra + c) a+m saxl-Si v-cxovr-ob-t

sa+na+m(de) and vi+d+re(+mde) (older variants being sa+na+mdis/
vi+d+re+mdis), both of which roughly mean 'upto where/which point', such
that the different temporal notions are reflected in the varying syntax of
the clauses themselves.5.2.2.1.7.4.1 'while'

The prešence of a negative in the main clause motivates the introduction
of one in the subordinate clause too, e.g.   ar mo-g-šor-d-eb-i,                                    vi+d+re+mdis

adverb and by placing it immediately before the rom, we can start a

a negative, e.g.   i+s     mukta+xora m+gza+vr-ob-s xolme i+s + e, rom

mukta+xora m+gza+vr-ob-s xolme, bilet-s rom ar (Ø-)q'id(+)ul-

    Where the verb has a Privative Participle, it is often possible to
produce an alternative non-finite expression for the meaning 'without

   'Why are you crying? (If the question is 'why',) Because my father has

subordinate clausal sequence, e.g.      mt'r-isa i+m+it'om       m-e-šin-i-a,             rom si+k'vd+il-it

accompanying verb is negated, the šentence is to be interpreted as one in
which the negative negates not the main verb but rather the reason
offered. And so, faced with the sequence mt'r-isa i+m+it'om k'i ar mr

there is a more compelling reason than his mere threats for me to fear the

"    Alternatively, the addition of ara 'no' at the end of a simple statement
turns that statement into the equivalent leading-question. The final syllable

"1.8 Scope of the present workThough the general linguist will, I trust, find in the following pages
whatever he may desire to know about the workings of the Georgian
language, as it now stands this book represents my attempt to consign to
paper in the form of a fully-fledged reference grammar all the knowledge
of (as well as, I hope, the odd insight into) this challenging language that I
have acquired over the last twenty years of close study. Because of the
                              INTRODUCTION                                 15structure of the language it is no accident that the largest chapter below is
that devoted to the morphology of the verb. However, I have endeavoured
to give the fullest possible information also about the language's syntax,
since this is an area that is often cursorily treated, especially by native
linguists in the Caucasus.       The chapter on syntax begins with a
recapitulation of the essentials of the overall properties of the language
discussed in chapters 3 and 4, so that those primarily interested in
questions of syntax might be able to derive some benefit from the syntactic
descriptions presented in chapter 5 without necessarily having to master
all of the complex morphology that precedes them.
    With the publication of my course-book for Georgian in twenty lessons
for Routledge (1995b) and the imminent appearance of my Georgian Reader
(SOAS), I now draw this chapter in my linguistic endeavours to a close,
leaving it to others to work on this language in the certainty that its future
is fully secure; henceforth I shall concentrate on at least two of the
languages in the Caucasus about whose future the same happy prediction
can sadly not be made, namely Abxaz and Mingrelian—the irony is, one
could argue, that it is in the very success of Georgian that the threat to
these languages and cultures lies.","[33, 34]"
"1.3 The History of Georgian PhilologyThe earliest known work in Georgian to deal with philological issues in the
language, namely A Treatise on Articles, was discovered by Mzekala
Shanidze (1984) as part of the 11th-12th century manuscript No.6 from the
collection of the I veron Monastery on Mt. Athos, a work she tentatively
attributes to the scholar Eprem Mtsire. Sulxan Saba Orbeliani (1658-1725)
produced the first native dictionary in 1716, whilst the first grammar of the
6                         GEORGI AN GRAMMARlanguage written in Georgian belongs to Zurab Shanshovani (1737), followed
in 1753 and 1767 by versions of a more comprehensive description by
Patriarch Ant'on I (1720-1788). A number of grammatical works appeared
through the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was essentially in the
writings of T h e Father of Modern Georgian Philology', Ak'ak'i Shanidze
(February 1887-March 1987), that Georgian grammar finally came of age.
His monumental Fundamentals of the Georgian Language, most recently re­
printed in 1980, will long remain the ultimate reference for all students of
Georgian morphology once they have gained a reading-knowledge of the
language. The Georgian Academy published the 8-volume Explanatory
Dictionary of the Georgian Language (KEGL, in abbreviation of its native
title, viz. kart+ul-i en-is gan+mart'+eb+it-i leksik'on-i) between
 1950 and 1964 under the general editorship of Arnold Cikobava, who
contributed his own grammatical sketch in volume 1. I ndeed, it has to be
said that the preparation of this grammar was greatly facilitated by the
invaluable information provided by this magnificent work, for apart from
using the volumes to check the existence and morphology of many of the
verb-forms quoted, I made lavish use of the illustrations included in the
various articles consulted, many of which are quoted as presented, though
in other cases I reduced the content for concentration on the feature in
question. Working so intimately with these volumes over the months, I
came to appreciate even more than I had before just how indispensable
they are for any serious student of Georgian. I know that this dictionary
has been the target of a good deal of criticism over the years, but I am
happy to speak strongly in its defence here. It has the unparalleled
advantage over any other dictionary of Georgian in its inclusion of so much
illustrative material from attested usage. One of the great desiderata in
Kartvelology is for a really good bilingual dictionary including illustrative
material of just this kind, and the first step in any such project would
surely be to render the Georgian definitions in KEGL into some appropriate
second language (like English!) and then to publish the result in a single
volume with a greatly reduced size of font on good quality thin paper, after
the fashion of The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. If such a project
could be financed, at least two observations should be borne in mind: (i) the
long quotes from the published works of Stalin that rather burden volumes
 1-4 could usefully be pruned or replaced, and (ii) since citations are with
3rd person subject (and object(s)), it is not always possible to predict the
form of a verbal root in some paradigms when the subject (or direct object)
is 1st or 2nd person (e.g. given ga-(Ø-)č'r-a 'X cut Y/them', it is not
possible to predict that 'I cut X/them' is ga-v-(Ø-)č'er-i with root
expanded by -e-), so that this information should either be given as part of
                              INTRODUCTION                                  7the citation for relevant verbs, or appropriate examples should be included
in the illustrative materials, which goal KEGL does not always achieve—
see the suggestions along these lines I made in Hewitt (1991a). Without
KEGL whatever value the present volume may have would have been
considerably diminished. Useful articles will also be found in the ongoing
series Questions on the Culture of Georgian Speech, whose 9th volume
appeared in 1989. Numerous dialectal words are contained in the various
volumes of Materials on the History of Georgia's Domestic Industry and
Craftsmanship (in Georgian), which began publication in 1976.
     Foreign investigation of Georgian began in the 17th century with the
work of Italian missionaries—for the history of the study of Caucasian
languages in general see (the Mingrelian) Arnold Chikobava (1965). In 1629
there were published in Rome the Alphabetum Ihericum, sive Georgianum,
cum Oratione Dominicali and S. Paolini's Georgian-Italian Dictionary. In
 1643 M. Maggio followed these with his Georgian Grammar. Facsimiles of
these three bibliographical rarities were published in Tbilisi in 1983 under
the title First Printed Books in Georgian (Xelovneba). F. Bopp, M. Brosset
and H. Schuchardt dealt with aspects of Georgian in the 19th century, and
in 1904 A. Dirr produced his short Theoretisch-praktische Grammatik der
modernen georgischen [grusinischen] Sprache (Leipzig). More recent works
that may be consulted with profit are: G. Deeters Das           kharthwelische
 Verbum (Leipzig, 1930), K. Tschenkéli Einführung in die georgische Sprache
(Zürich, 1958) in two volumes, as well as his             Georgisch-Deutsches
 Wörterbuch in three volumes (1965-1974), which is easily the most
outstanding of any of the bilingual dictionaries currently available, H. Vogt
 Grammaire de la langue géorgienne (Paris, 1971), H. Aronson Georgian—A
Reading Grammar (Chicago, 1982 & 1990)2, H. Fähnrich Kurze Grammatik
der georgischen Sprache (Leipzig, 1986), whilst for Old Georgian there is
this same scholar's 1982 German translation of A. Shanidze's short Grammar
of the Old Georgian Language (both the original (1976) and the translation
published in Tbilisi) as well as in his own right a grammatical sketch of
 1991 and now the monograph Grammatik der altgeorgischen               Sprache
(Hamburg, 1994). My own Georgian: A Learner's Grammar (Routledge,
 1995b) is now available as a self-tutor for English-speaking readers.
     Standing at the intersection of Europe and Asia and occupying an
 important strategic position in the Transcaucasus, Georgia has been
regarded as an attractive prize by more powerful peoples since time
 immemorial. Græco-Roman, Persian, Arabic, Turkish and, latterly, Russian
 influences have all left their traces on the language, especially in respect
of the lexicon. The Academy Dictionary (KEGL) states the provenance of
many foreign lexemes, and in 1964 M. C'abashvili published a dictionary of
8                          GEORGI AN GRAMMARforeign words. The standard reference for Georgian-Iranian linguistic
contacts is the 1966 monograph by Mzia Andronik'ashvili. For Armeno-
Kartvelian contacts see Vogt (1938 & 1988).","[24, 25, 26, 27]"
" Thematic Suffix -am
The prefixal pattern is employed. The Thematic Suffix is retained in its
reduced form of - m - before -eb; if the root should end in -v, this latter
disappears under the influence of the now contiguous bilabial nasal. The
illustrated verb is the Intransitive counterpart of (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-b-am 'you
(will) bind X/them':   be bound/bindable
   v-i-b-m-eb-i                v-i-b-m-eb-i-t
   (Ø-)i-b-m-eb-i (Ø-)i-b-m-eb-i-t
   i-b-m-eb-a                  i-b-m-eb-i-an   Some roots of this sub-class may behave like some of those in -av by
employing the older conjugation in -i without suffix - e b - and with 3rd
person singular marking in - s . The root - s v - in the šense of 'pose
(question), put (Pl.)nctuation mark)' not only illustrates this but also the loss
of root-final -v—from sa+k'itx-s (da-)(Ø-Ø-)sv-am 'you (will) pose a
question' we get sa+k'itx-i i-s-m-eb-a = i-s-m-i-s, which forms are,
however, more likely in the Future Sub-Series (sc. with preverb da-), for
286                         GEORGIANGRAMMARi-s-m-eb-a is more usual in the šense of 'X is drinkable', whilst i-s-m-i-s
is more normally used in the šense of 'X is audible (smellable)'. Belonging
here are the alternatives i - t k - m - e b - a = i - t k - m - i - s 'X is being
said/sayable' from the root -tkv- which we shall see in Series 11 and 111
for the verb 'say' (vid. 4.1Ø), though it also found as a normal Transitive
(with Subjective Version in Series I and II) in the verbal phrase sul-s
(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-tkv-am 'you (will) breathe deeply; exist'. Interestingly,
KEGl quotes only the verb-form (Ø-)e-tk-m-i-s for the bipersonal form
meaning 'X can say Y/them' or 'X can be said of Y'.","[304, 305]"
"1.9 Principles of CitationAll words are divided into constituent morphemes. Morpheme-boundaries
are indicated either by the hyphen or a plus-sign, the latter (+) being used
either when the identity of each morpheme is not important to the
particular phenomenon being explained (and thus they are not individually
glossed in those instances where morpheme-analyses are provided) or when
it is suspected that a morpheme-boudary is present but the precise analysis
might be unclear. For example, we could gloss each component of the Past
Participle 'baked' thus:
     ga-mo-m-cxv-ar-i
     Preverb-Preverb-Past.Participle.Prefix-bake-Past.Participle.Suffix-
                                                              Agreement.Marker
but it would normally be important only to know that this word is a verbal
adjective meaning 'baked', and it would therefore usually be presented
simply as:
     ga+mo+m+cxv+ar-i
     baked-AGR
     'baked'
     To illustrate the second case let us take the verbal noun (Masdar) of
the copula, q'+op+n-a, where the Masdar-formant is the final -a.
16                            GEORGI AN GRAMMARComparing this non-finite form with the finite v-i-q'av-i 'I was' vs i-q'+o
<= earlier i-q'v-a 'X was', we see that the root is -q'((a)v)- (with v -
marking 1st person subject, (-)i- an old passive marker 6 , -i an Indicative
exponent for the Aorist tense, and -a/+o the indicator of a 3rd person
singular subject). Readers will see that I have glossed the old passive
marker with such (Series 11 ) forms of the copula as the Subjective Version
vowel, even though, rather arbitrarily, I have glossed what in origin was
the same i-vowel in the Future Sub-Series forms of the copula, which
derive from an old passive of another root meaning 'do, make' (namely
-k(m)n-), as the Passive marker. What then in the Masdar are the
components - o p - and - n - ? An equals-sign (=) is used either where the
script would itself employ a hyphen or to indicate reduplication. A
question-mark applied to a whole word raises doubts as the
acceptability/existence of that word; when applied to an agreement-affix
within a verb, it questions either the presence of that (zero-)affix or
uncertainty as to the implied referent.
    The provenance of some examples is stated, but mostly no such source
is quoted. A large number of citations are taken from the illustrative
material in KEGL; most of the rest have been noted by me over the years
from my general reading of, and/or listening to, Georgian; occasionally
simple sentences were made up by myself.
    Readers cannot fail to notice the imbalance in the length of the
chapters, with Chapter 4 on verbal morphology representing more than all
the other chapters put together. This is a natural consequence of the fact
that the chief difficulty (and, to the linguist, greatest attraction) of
Georgian resides in the wonderful complexity of the verbal system. I have
endeavoured to give too much rather than too little information on the
various conjugational patterns (to such an extent that I suspect some may
accuse me of unnecessary spoon-feeding). However, as the verb is the
essence of this language, I felt it was important that readers new to the
language should be able to turn up immediately any particular 'screeve' (=
tense-, mood- or aspect-paradigm) and see how any individual sub-class of
verb conjugates therein. I have also tried to give as much guidance as I
could to help readers see and understand the many highways and byways
traversed by individual verb-roots.","[34, 35]"

deliberative questions ('Am I/Are you etc... to VERB?'). Prohibitions
(negative commands) may be expressed by means of ar plus this screeve.
    All Transitive Verbs (other than 'give', which is discussed separately in
4.1Ø), form their Aorist Subjunctive by means of either -o or -a, which
vowels are added to the form of the root used for the Aorist Indicative
with 3rd person subject and remain throughout the conjugation. The 3rd
person singular subject selects the allomorph -s, whilst the 3rd person
plural subject takes -n.",[273]

The simple equivalent of '(either...) or' is (an...) an, and this is true for
disjunctive conjunction of words, phrases or clauses (e.g. an si+k'vd+il-i

by 'or', it may take the ancient form anu (e.g. cocxal-i anu m+k'vd+ar-i
'alive or dead'), which latter is often found when in English we would have

"    With other roots the use of the Subjective Version when the verb has
no indirect object contrasts with the abšence of any versioniser in the
prešence of an indirect object. Examples: p'ur-s (Ø-Ø-)i-txov 'you will
ask for bread' vs mezobel-s p'ur-s (Ø-Ø-)s-txov 'you will ask the

    Since the Subjective Version does not always appear when one would
logically expect it, it is perhaps hardly surprising that one can adduce
examples where the locative Version wins out when either the Subjective
or the locative Version could logically be employed, e.g.      kal-ma        tav-i      da-(Ø-Ø-)a-k'l-a                 kmar-s

    No Subjective Version is possible when the root requires the indirect

      'the hero sacrificed his own life to his own country'    In a colloquial expression for 'gathering X together', the direct object
tav-i does not belong to the verb's subject and so would never motivate
the Subjective Version, e.g.      mo-v-(Ø-Ø-)u-q'ar-e                                    tav-i

and lack of versioniser with some intransitive verb-forms. An indirect
object can be associated with the basic verb of motion. I n the Future Sub-
Series and in Series 11 this indirect object has to be indicated by the
                              VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                           201Objective Version—for mo-svl-a 'coming' this gives examples like ra mo-
g-i-va-t? 'what will come over you(Pl)?', ra mo-gv-i-vid-od-a? 'what
would come/would have come over us?', ra mo-(Ø-)u-vid-a-t? 'what
came over them?', etc... In the Prešent Sub-Series the lack of versioniser
seems more common, for this coupling of preverb and root at any rate (e.g.
ra mo-s-di-t? 'what comes over them?'). This verb-form can also mean
with either marking of the indirect object 'receive, gain, acquire', though in
the expression 'liquid flows from' (as in:      t'an-i+dan sisxl-i          mo-s-di-od-a

For the motion-root in association with other preverbs it will sometimes be
the case that in the Prešent Sub-Series some šense(s) may be conveyed by
either marking of the indirect object, whereas others may be particular to
one method or the other, e.g.      ra-d        (Ø-)t'ir-i?      ga-m-di-s    /       ga-m-i-di-s

Notes1   lat'avra Gelenidze's Vocabulary Connected with the Anatomy-Physiology of
    Man in OldGEORGIAN(Tbilisi, 1974, inGEORGIAN)should be consulted by anyone
    interested in the OldGEORGIANvocabulary.
2   Sulxan Saba Orbeliani (1658-1725) gives a rather interesting list of synonyms in his
    dictionary. I quote: 'sk'ore is the general term for the outpassings [ganavaltaj of
    creatures. But that of birds is called sk'int'li, that of fish t'urt'li, that of reptiles
    curcli, that of goats and wild goats k'urk'li, that of cows and water-buffalo nexvi
    and k'eli [N.B. ModernGEORGIANhas both k'eli and nak'elij, that of pigs čxrink'eli,
    that of horses and donkeys čončorik'i, that of dogs and beasts mčore, that of men
    mjgneri, dried excrement c'iva and pune, watery fæces t'rac'i, the droppings of a
    pigeon naedomi.' As for the basic term, is there a connection with Ancient Greek
    skč:r (Genitive skatčs) = latin stercus = Old Norse sklta = Anglo-Saxon scitan =
    English shit?GEORGIANalso uses the word p'at'ivi 'honour, respect' as a synonym
    (?euphemism) for nak'eli, nexvi. Note the play on words in the proverb: mic'a-s
    (Ø-)u-tkv-am-s: p'at'iv-i da-(Ø-Ø-)m-a-q'ar-e da p'at'iv-s da-(Ø-)g-a-q'r-i-
    o The earth apparently said: «Cast dung upon me and I shall cast honour [sc. in terms
    of a fine harvestj on you»'.
3   The preverb c'a- is given by Sulxan Saba Orbeliani, whilst (ga+)k'u+eb+a is given
    by Fähnrich/Sardzhveladze (199Ø). Because it is reminiscent of this verb, the plural of
    k'u 'tortoise' tends to be avoided — hence the attraction above the city of Tbilisi is
    called k'u-s t'ba Tortoise lake' rather than k'u-eb-is t'ba.
4   This verb is defined in Sulxan Saba Orbeliani's dictionary as: k'ac-ta-gan kal-is
    da-m+dab+1-eb-a 'the lowering (sc. corrupting) of a woman by men'. Dee Ann
    Holisky in her 1981 study Aspect andGEORGIANMedial Verbs' quotes (p.75) c'er-s 'X
    screws Y' vs c'er-a-ob-s 'X screws (intransitive)'. This root's non-slang meaning is,
696                              GEORGI AN GRAMMAR
      of course, 'write'. In Mingrelian part of the paradigm of (do-)xod-u-a falls together
      with that of the verb meaning 'sit down'. If in the Present b-xod-un-k is 'I fuck X'
      and b-xod-u-k is 'I sit down', in the Aorist do-b-xod-i should mean both 'I fucked
      X' and 'I sat down'. In fact, there seems to have been an attempt to avoid ambiguity
      by producing a new form for the commoner verb; Q'ipshidze's 1914 grammar quotes
      ko-do-do-b-xod-i as an alternative for the meaning 'I sat down', where, apart from
      the affirmative prefix ko-, the normal preverb has been reduplicated. When I myself
      was examining this verb some years ago in Ochamchira, one informant gave me the
      following paradigm: do-b-xod-u-k 'I sit down' vs (ks-)do-b-do-xod-u-k 'I shall sit
      down' vs (ke-)do-b-do-xod-i 'I sat down' vs the inverted do-m-Q-)xun(-u) 'I have
      sat down'. What seems to be happening is that, as is generally more common in
      Mingrelian than Georgian, the preverb is not restricted to the non-Present, so that the
      Present here begins with the root's normal preverb. In addition to the affirmative
      prefix, both the Future and Aorist shew reduplication of the normal preverb but with
      the difference from the form given by Q'ipshidze that the inner preverb has fused with
      the root, forcing the subject-marker to follow one instance of the preverb but precede
      the second.
5     Expressions for 'dying' (specifically 'the woman died') include the following: kal-i mo-
      k'vd-a = kal-i garda-i-cval-a = kal-ma sul-i gan-(0-?0-)u-t'ev-a (lit. X gave
      up the soul') = kal-ma c'er+il-i c'a-(0-)i-g-o (lit. 'X took the letter') = kal-ma
      sul-i da-(0-)l-i-a (lit. 'X drank the soul') = kal-s sul-i a-mo-(0-)xd-a.

      This grammar is dedicated to the memory of
           the two finest scholars of Georgian

              Gerhard Deeters (1892-1961)

 unbiased examination of the facts and not on a point of
view with which one has become obsessed in advance and
to which we then have to align and accommodate the facts'

                               PREFACE
This work began with the aim, consistent with the general goal of the
Benjamin-SOAS series of which it is a part, of presenting the essential
structural characteristics of Georgian for the benefit of general linguists.
As it progressed, however, it turned into something more than this. It had
been my aim to write a reference grammar of Georgian after a further ten
years or so of study, but the request from the Series' editors, Professor
Thea Bynon and Professor Matt Shibatani, to contribute a description of
Georgian happened to coincide with an unforeseen rift in my relations with
Georgia which is unlikely to be repaired. And so, rather than continue to
study this language, to which I was introduced seriously in 1975 when I
travelled to Tbilisi as a Cambridge post-graduate student for a year of
intensive learning on a British Council exchange, as, now of necessity for
me, a virtual dead language, I decided that it was time to kill three birds
with one stone. In marshalling here the sum total of the knowledge that I
have acquired over the last twenty years I hope (a) to have satisfied the
faith placed in my ability by Professors Bynon and Shibatani to write a
grammar of use for the general linguist, (b) to have produced a worthwhile
reference-grammar (the first in English) that it had always been my desire
to compose, and (c) to end thereby the period when Georgian has
represented the main focus of my study and research. If I succeed in
easing even a few people's passage through the waiting mysteries, I shall
conclude the last 20 years to have been well spent.
                            CORRIGENDUMThe Georgian for 'you (will) seat (plural) X' is (da-)sx-am, and not (da-)a-sx-
am, as given throughout this work. The latter form does exist but in the
meaning 'you (will) seat (plural) X on Y', which is to say that the pre-radical
a-vowel functions fully as exponent of the Locative Version. The verb-form
(da-)a-sx-am may, of course, also mean 'you (will) pour (liquid) X'.
                      ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
During the two academic years (1975-76, 1979-80) I spent with The British
Council in Tbilisi as well as in the course of other trips, such as my 3-
month sabbatical there at the end of 1987 through the auspices of The
British Academy, I came to know many Georgians, Mingrelians and Svans
whom I regarded as dear friends and from whom I learned a great deal
about Georgian and Georgia, whether or not they were conscious of their
role as teachers! Under normal circumstances I would have been happy to
list them all in the expectation that it might have gratified them to see their
names in such a book. However, circumstances have changed, and, since I
would not wish to embarrass anyone, I shall merely say that my gratitude
remains undimmed and that any Kartvelian who is still interested in
receiving thanks from me may consider themselves included in this
anonymous list.
     Dr. Rieks Smeets (Leiden University) was kind enough to read an early
draft of chapter 5 and offer some helpful comments thereon. Thea Bynon's
advice was, as anyone who knows her would naturally expect, especially
valuable. Professor Donald Rayfield (Queen Mary Westfield, London
University) cast his experienced eye over the whole manuscript and was a
source of constant encouragement during the preparation of the work.
Mrs. Joyce Hutchinson exhibited great patience in bringing the text into
conformity with the requirements of the publishers, and SOAS was kind
enough to support this publication by generously reimbursing her for so
doing. Mrs. Catherine Lawrence of SOAS' Department of Geography
enthusiastically made her skills available by drawing the map for this
volume. And finally without the understanding of my long-suffering wife,
Zaira, and daughters, Amra and Gunda, for my almost umbilical attachment
to the computer-console while this book was gestating, its birth would have
been considerably delayed. I thank all concerned and alone take the blame
for any mistakes outstanding.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"'Be' (2nd/3rd person subject)
GEORGIANis like a number of European languages in using the 2nd person
plural form of a verb for polite address. And so, for the copula we have,
for example, ro+gora x-a+r? 'how are you' as the familiar form vs
ro+gora x-a+r-t? as a more formal question (obligatory, of course, when
addressing more than one person). However, for an even greater level of
politeness we have ro+gor (Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t?. This preverbless
                            VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                           495Intransitive form of the root is restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series, and
the Prešent Subjunctive is common in the parting-expression k'arg-ad
(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-od-e-t! 'Be well!'. The verb-form is also found, if less
commonly, with 2nd person singular and 3rd person subject (e.g.
msaxur+t+u+x+u+c+es-i vardan dadian-i brjan-d-eb-a 'the Chief
of Domestic Staff is Vardan Dadiani').","[513, 514]"
"    The list of Indirect Verbs could be considerably lengthened by
including such Desideratives as g-e-t'ir-eb-a 'you have a hankering to
cry', g-e-mger-eb-a 'you feel like singing', g-e-mtknar-eb-a 'you feel
like yawning', g-e-tk-m-i-s 'you feel like saying X/them', which tend to be
limited to the Prešent Sub-Series. There are also a whole range of
Indirect formations (Judgmentals) based on adjectives, which usually exist
in both Series I and II, though without any preverb, and indicate the
opinion of the Dative nominal that the Nominative nominal has the quality
of the adjectival root (e.g. advil-i 'easy' => g-e-advil-eb-a/g-e-advil-a
392                             GEORGIANGRAMMAR'you judge/judged X to be easy', cot'a 'few, a little' => g-e-cot'a-v-eb-
a/g-e-cot'a-v-a 'you deem/deemed X too few/small', jnel-i 'difficult' =>
g-e-)nel-eb-a/g-e-)nel-a 'you reckon/reckoned X to be difficult' 143                       vs
(ga-)g-i-)nel-d-eb-a 'X is (will) be difficult for you' => Aorist ga-g-i-
jnel-d-a => Perfect ga-g-)nel-eb-i-a). Then there are those verbs
where the Indirect form indicates that the action took place without the
intention of the Dative nominal (e.g. (ga-)g-e-cin-eb-a 'you (will) burst
out laughing' => Aorist g a - g - e - c i n - a => Perfect g a - g - c i n - e b - i - a ;
(ga-)g-e-gim-eb-a 'you (will) burst into a smile' => Aorist ga-g-e-gim-a
=> Perfect ga-g-gim-eb-i-a). With the two Indirect Verbs just prešented
compare the preverbal Mediais ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you will begin to
laugh' => Aorist ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-e => ga-g-i-cin-i-a, and ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-
gim-eb 'you will start to smile' => Aorist ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-gim-e => Perfect
ga-g-i-gim-i-a. But we leave our discussion of this class of verbs here
in the hope that the structure of the system is clear.
                               VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                          3934.7.5 Stative Verbs (st'at'ik'+ur-i zmn-eb-is k'las-i)
The Stative Verbs are a small and somewhat marginal group of verbs used
to indicate a particular state of their Nominative subject. As the state is
ongoing and unchanging, it is has no natural aim or end-point, and thus
perfective aspect is an inapplicable concept, reflected in the total
morphological abšence of preverbs with such verb-forms. A morphological
peculiarity of Statives, however, is that, whether or not they are bivalent
by virtue of there being a Dative indirect object prešent, the screeves
existing in Series I and 11 are nevertheless bipersonal, though in Series 111
the three screeves will be either monopersonal or bipersonal depending
upon whether the verb in question is monovalent or bivalent respectively.
    In the Prešent Sub-Series most Statives possess only the Prešent
Indicative (the Aorist Indicative and Aorist Subjunctive standing in place of
the missing Imperfect and Prešent Subjunctive respectively). Most Statives
only occur with a 3rd person singular subject and usually end in the
morphic sequence -i-a 1 4 4 , where - i - is the Stative Prešent exponent and
-a is the 3rd person subject agreement-suffix, though a few Statives end in
the Prešent in the sequence -av-s. In the Future Sub-Series and in Series
II Statives are formed like prefixal Intransitive Verbs with an obligatory e-
prefix. The structure of the root and the type of ending in Series 11
screeves (sc. Weak vs Strong in the Indicative, and o- versus a-vowel in
the Subjunctive) is determined by the pattern which is usually
characteristic of the given root when it is functioning non-Statively. In
Series III, however, a monovalent Stative is formed monopersonally just
like any monovalent Intransitive Verb (see the relevant sub-sections of
4.7.2.3) with the Past Participle fused to the appropriate forms of the
copula—sometimes, however, an extra component - e b - is introduced; a
bivalent Stative is formed bipersonally just like any normal bivalent
Intransitive Verb (see the relevant sub-sections of 4.7.2.3) with the Masdar
fused either to the Prešent of the copula in the case of the Perfect or to
the increment -od- plus the endings characteristic of either the Imperfect
or Prešent Subjunctive in the case of the Pluperfect or III rd Subjunctive
respectively—sometimes, however, an extra component - e b - is again
introduced.
     In addition to the obligatory indirect object marking with even
monovalent Statives in Series I and 11, one may find a meaningful indirect
object associated with some Statives, thereby making them not only
bipersonal but fully bivalent. Depending upon the verb, this indirect object
will be indicated in the Prešent Sub-Series (which is to say in the Prešent
 Indicative) by (i) placing the relevant agreement-prefix immediately in front
394                           GEORGIANGRAMMARof the root, (ii) using the Objective Version, (iii) using the locative Version.
I n the Future Sub-Series and in Series 11, however, there is syncretism of
the monovalent and bivalent forms. let us illustrate by taking the root
-k'id- 'be suspended' (cf. its Transitive Verbal guise in (da-)(Ø-Ø-)k'id-
eb 'you (will) hang X/them up'): monovalently we have:      surat-i         k'edel-ze h-k'id-i-a
      picture-NOM wall-on         ?3rd.PER-suspended-PRES.STAT-it
      'the picture is hanging on the wall'vs its bivalent usage in:      p'rezident'-s pex-eb-ze h-k'id-i-a,                   ra+m+den-i
      president-DAT foot-Pl-on him-hung-PRES.STAT-it how.many-AGR
      k'ac-i        mo-k'vd-a
      man-NOM PREV-die-3rd.PER(AOR)
      'the president doesn't give a damn how many men died'vs a second type of bivalent usage in:      kal-s     lamaz-i    surat-i                   (Ø-)u-k'id-i-a 145
      woman-DAT pretty-AGR picture-NOM               (her-)OV-suspended-
                                                                      PRES.STAT-it
      k'edel-ze
      wall-on
      'the woman has a pretty picture hanging on the wall'    If each of these three šentences is transposed into the future, only one
verb-form will appear in them, and that verb-form is                  (Ø-)e-k'id-eb-a146
Again only the one form (Ø-)e-k'id-a will appear if the transposition is to
the past (cf. the Aorist Subjunctive (Ø-)e-k'id-o-s). For the Perfect the
monovalent šentence would include the verb-form k'id-eb-ul-a (cf.
Pluperfect k'id-eb-ul-i-q'+o, I l l r d Subjunctive k'id-eb-ul-i-q'-o-s),
whereas the two bivalent usages would require the selection of the
bipersonal h - k ' i d - e b - i - a (cf. Pluperfect h - k ' i d - e b - o d - a , IIIrd
Subjunctive h-k'id-eb-od-e-s).
    Where a Stative is obligatorily construed with a meaningful indirect
object, one feels that the statement being made relates more to this Dative
nominal than to the Nominative one, which raises the question of which of

Stative Verb. I then list with 3rd person subject (and, indirect object for
bipersonal forms) the Prešent Indicative, Future Indicative (FI), Aorist
Indicative (AI), Aorist Subjunctive (AS), plus both monovalent and bivalent
Perfect (MP vs BP) and Pluperfect (MPP vs BPP) (assuming that all these are
found) for at least all the Stative Verbs given by Shanidze (198Ø.315-318) as
existing in ModernGEORGIAN.","[410, 411, 412, 413, 414]"
"4.9.4 Privative Participle
The obligatory component of Privative Participles is the prefix u- (see 3.9.2
for its role as a privative adjective-formant in derivational morphology),
which stands immediately before the root and after any preverb(s) that
might accompany the root in question, for any such preverbs will be
prešent in this participle. The meaning is 'not having VERBed' for
exclusively Intransitive Verbs (e.g. ga-u-svl-el-i 'not having gone out')
and 'not having been VERBed' for Transitives (e.g. gan-u-xorc+iel-eb-
el-i 'not having been realised (lit. made flesh), unrealised'); sometimes such
participles are best translated into English as 'unVERBable' (e.g. eg gegma
srul+i + ad     g a n - u - x o r c + i e l - e b - e l - i - a 'that plan is completely
unrealisable'; mo-u-rč-en-el-l/gan-u-k'urn-eb-el-i c'q'lul-i 'an
unhealed/unhealable ulcer' vs av+ad+m+q'+op+oba-m mi-(Ø-)i-g-o
mo-u-rš-en-el-i/gan-u-k,urn-eb-el-i xasiat-i 'the illness took on an
untreatable character'; da-u-vic'q'-ar-i/da-u-vic'q'-eb-el-i 'unfor­
gettable'). In the Adverbial case the Privative Participle is frequently
found employed both as a simple adverb (mo-u-rid-eb-1-ad 'unreticently')
and as a non-finite method for expressing the notion 'without VERBing' (for
this latter role see 5.2.2.1.2). For some particular verbs with Thematic
Suffix -eb the Adverbial ending -ad is still often replaced by the
somewhat mysterious ending -iv (e.g. ga-u-tav-eb-1-ad/ga-u-tav-eb-
1-iv = da-u-srul-eb-1-ad/da-u-srul-eb-l-iv 'without end, endlessly').
Abstract nouns in -oba based on this participle are very common (e.g.
angariš-is ga-u-c'-ev-l-oba 'not rendering account, neglecting' =
q'ur+ad+g+eb-is mi-u-kc-ev-1-oba 'not paying attention, lack of
attention', ga-u-zrd-el-oba 'uncouthness, lack of manners/upbringing').",[452]

"5.2.2.1.5 Concession
Esšentially there are two conjunctions that mark concession: tu+mc(a)
'although' is found with non-SUBJunctive verbs, whilst tu+nd(+a(+c)) 'even
if' is principally used in association with the Prešent SUBJunctive for
prešent concessions, with the Aorist SUBJunctive for future concessions, or
with the Pluperfect Indicative for past concessions. The latter conjunction
is analysable as tu 'if', the modal particle u+nd+a 'it is necessary', and -c
'even', which element occurs on a number of subordinating conjunctions and
pronouns to distinguish them from their interrogative variants—sometimes
this clitic attaches to some other word within the clause rather than to the
concessive conjunction itself. In addition to tu, the former conjunction
contains the now obsolete formant -mc(a), whose role in OldGEORGIANwas
to lend a šense of non-factuality to the indicative with which it was
construed. Examples:      tu+nd xvale      mo-m-k'1-a-n,                      a r m-e-nagvl-eb-a

association with the Genitive of the 3rd person deictic demonstrative

The simplest construction has ro+gor+c 'as' (cf. interrogative ro+gor?
'how?') introducing an indicative verb, the order of the two clauses being
irrelevant, e.g.   ro+gor+c        šen      g-e-p'rian-eb-a,            i+s + e
   as           you(DAT) you-IOV-appeal-TS-it           so
   mo-(Ø-)i-kec-i
   PREV-(you-)PASS-act-AOR.INDIC(=I MPER)
   'Act as the fancy takes you'    If the correlative is i + m + gvar + ad(-ve) 'in (just) that way', the
manner-clause will be introduced by ro+gor+ada+c, whilst a parallel
correlative-conjunctional coupling is i+m+nair+ad(-ve)...ra+nair+ada+c.
    If the above reprešent factual clauses of manner, the situation is
somewhat different in the case of hypothetical manner-clauses. The
subordinating conjunction is t+i+tk+o(+s) 'as if, as though', which derives
from tu i+tkv+a 'if it was/is said' or tu i+tkv+a+s 'if it transpires that it
is said'. The conjunction permits three constructions: (a) the verb will be in
that tense of the indicative which is appropriate to the demands of the
main verb; (b) the Prešent SUBJunctive may replace the Prešent Indicative if
59Ø                         GEORGIANGRAMMARthe main verb is non-past, whilst the III rd SUBJunctive may replace an
Aorist Indicative or Perfect that would have occurred in the putative
original direct speech, regardless of the tense of the main verb; (c) given
the prešence of a form of the verb 'say' within the conjunction, the clause
may reflect the reporting of original speech (or thought) by coupling the
speech-particle -o with the words originally spoken (or thought), e.g.      sax-is       ga+mo+me+t'q'v+el+eb+a i+s+e+t-i

5.2.2.1.7.1'when'
The basic temporal conjunctions are the fully interchangeable
r(+)o+de+sa+c and r(+)o+ca 'when' (cf. interrogative r( + )o + di+s?
'when?'), either of which will stand at the start of a clause containing an
indicative verb, e.g.      r(+)o+de+sa+c / / r(+)o+ca mo-x-val,                šen-i
      when                          PREV-you-come(FuT) your-AGR

      sister(NOM)-too PREV-(you-her-)SV-bring-AOR.INDIC(=IMPER)
      'When you come, bring your sister too'    Examples may also be found of causal ra+k'i and manner ro+gor
appearing in contexts where it seems more appropriate to translate them
as 'when'.
    The general subordinator rom is frequently used, especially in speech,
in a temporal šense, so that the subordinate clause in the above-example
could be replaced by:      šen / /     a+k    rom      mo-x-val...
      you(NOM)    here   when

suitable insertions to protect the clitic rom from claušinitial position. The
non-finite method of expressing the basic temporal notion is to use the
Masdar of the subordinate verb. It stands in the Genitive case, being
dependent upon dro-s, Dative of the noun dro 'time', e.g.   tv+it+m+pr+in+av-ši š s v l - i s                  dro-s    gul-is
   aeroplane-in        PREV-enter-GEN(MASD)           time-DAT heart-

   churn-TS-MASD(NOM) me-IOV-begin-TS-it          generally
   'When entering a plane I start to feel nauseous as a rule'   The Masdar plus dro-s may be fused to produce the Dative of the
Genitive base within the Masdar alone (i.e. š s v l - i s a - s ) .5.2.2.1.7.2 'as soon as'
Two finite reprešentations exist. The first places the words ro+gor+c k'i
'as soon as' at the start of the indicative subordinate clause, which may
either precede or follow the main clause, e.g.   ro+gor+c k'i       šen-i     c'er+il-i     mo-m-i-va,
   as.soon.as        you-AGR letter-NOM PREV-me-OV-come(.it.FuT)

   it-DAT PREV-I -(it-)SV-read-TS(FuT)
   'As soon as your letter reaches me, I shall read it'    The second strategy is based on the formation of alternative questions
and places the words tu ara 'or not' immediately after the subordinate
verb; a peculiarity of this strategy is that the subordinate clause must
precede the main clause, so that the first clause in the last example may be
recast to give either:   šen-i c'er+il-i mo-m-i-va tu ara,...or mo-m-i-va tu ara šen-i c'er+il-i,...","[607, 608, 609, 610]"

category, e.g.      m+c'vrtn+el-ma          lom-s        (?Ø-)s-cem-a
      trainer-ERGA           lion-DATB     (?itB-)itB-hit-heA(AOR)
      'the trainer hit the lion'    However, colloquially there is a tendency to normalise this verb by
treating the indirect object as the direct object and to c a š m a r k it
accordingly (viz. m+c'vrtn+el-ma lom-i (Ø-)?s-cem-a). A number of
what today are regular transitive verbs with subject and direct object were
in OldGEORGIANof the unregularised 'hit'-type (see Footnote 3 of Chapter
4).
    The Objective Version vowels serve to create indirect objects, cf.      m+xat'+v+ar-i       p'ort'ret'-s     (Ø-)xat'-av-s       sardl-is-tvis

and since one does come across cases of the Pluperfect substituting for the

quotation.","[592, 593]"
"'Motion' (2nd/3rd person subject)
The root that serves as an honorific copula when preverbless, namely
-brjan-, when endowed with a preverb expressing direction becomes an
honorific for the basic verb of motion (e.g. mo-(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t 'you
(will) come' => Aorist mo-(Ø-)brjan-d-i-t, Perfect mo-(Ø-)brjan-eb-
ul-x-a+r-t). It is particularly common in asking questions (e.g. sad mi-
(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t? 'where are you going?) and in issuing commands (e.g.
mi-(Ø-)brjan-d-i-t, g-txov-t 'After you, please' = 'Go thither, I beg
you'). When the preverb is da-, the meaning of the verb-form is 'sit down',
whilst with a- the meaning is 'stand up'.
496                         GEORGIANGRAMMAR'Speak' (2nd/3rd person subject)
The root -brjan- when used transitively (again without preverb) means
'speak' or 'issue an instruction'. Examples: ra-s (Ø-Ø-)brjan-eb-t? 'what
are you saying?', (Ø-Ø-)brjan-e, äen-i xmal-i da čem-i k'iser-il
literally 'Speak, your sword and my neck' = 'Say what you want, I am yours
to command', sardal-ma (Ø-Ø-)brjan-a še+t'+ev+a-ze gada-svl-a
'the general ordered the going over to the attack'. When endowed with the
Objective Version, we get (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-brjan-eb 'you (will) give X/them
command Y','Say to'
Regardless of subject the usual verb for 'say to' can give way for reasons
of politeness to mo-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xs+en-eb 'you (will) say X/them to
Y/them'278 (e.g. mag-is še+sa+x+eb vera+per-s mo-(Ø-)g-a-xs+en-
eb-t for (Ø-)g-e-t'q'v-i-t 'I shall be unable to tell you anything about
that', did madl+oba-s mo-(Ø-)g-a-xs+en-eb-t for (mo-i-(Ø-)g-i-xd-
i-t 'I (shall) give you great thanks'). The Masdar mo-xs+en-eb-a may be
used as '(academic) talk, paper', with the Active Participle m o - m - x s + e n -
eb-el-i (with syncopating suffixal vowel) '(academic) speaker'. Without
preverb (Ø-Ø-)a-xs+en-eb is 'you (will) mention X/them' (Past Participle =
xs+en-eb-ul-i/na-xs+en-eb-i).","[514, 515]"
"     Given two sets of pronominal agreement-affixes, the subject usually
selects its marker from Set A, whilst the object is shewn by a Set B affix
(e.g. m-nax-av-s meB-see-TS-XA(FUT) 'X will see me'), whereas in part of
a transitive verb's set of paradigms and for certain verbs throughout their
conjugation the subject selects its marker from Set B, whilst the object is
indicated by a Set A affix (e.g. ar m-i-nax-av-s not I B - O V - s e e -
TS(PERF)-XA        'I have not seen X', m-q'+av-x-a + r 4          IB-have-youA-
be(PRES) 'I have you').
     Any individual verb-form will be classifiable as (i) Transitive, (ii)
Intransitive (passive), (iii) Medial, (iv) Indirect, (v) Stative. Whilst a single
root does not normally manifest all five types, let us take the root e'er in
an attempt to illustrate each of them: (i) (Ø-Ø-)c'er (you-X-)write(PRES)
'you write X/them', (ii) i-c'er-eb-a PASS-write-TS-X(PRES)           'X is being
written', (iii) (Ø-)c'er-a-ob which is quoted from Holisky (1981.75) as the
slang expression 'you screw around', (iv) (?)m-e-c'er-eb-a          I-IOV-write-
 TS-X(PRES)'\ feel like writing' 5 , (v) s-c'er-i-a ?-write-STAT(PRES)-X 'X is
(sc. in a state of having been) written'.
     GEORGIAN'scomplement of tense-mood-aspect forms (generically
referred to by Kartvelologists as 'screeves' from theGEORGIANword
mc'k'riv-i 'row') are divided into three 'Series': Series I consists of Prešent
Indicative, Prešent Subjunctive, Imperfect Indicative [together constituting
the Prešent Sub-Series], Future Indicative, Future Subjunctive and
Conditional [collectively constituting the Future Sub-Series]; Series 11
incorporates just the Aorist Indicative (or Simple Past) and Aorist
Subjunctive (called by some 'Optative'); Series 111 contains the Perfect
(which screeve, when used without a negative, often implies that the
speaker is drawing an inference from some prešent evidence that some
event must have preceded or that he is reporting hearsay about an

witnessed such that he can vouchsafe for the truth of what he is saying),
Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive. This three-way division is not merely
fundamental for the tripartite distinction in the morpho-syntactic marking
of subject and object of Transitive (and Medial) verbs discussed
morphologically in 4.7.1.3 and 4.7.3 as well as syntactically in 5.1.7, but also
facilitates the description of the morphological patterning of the various
sub-types of verb.
     Roots are normally associated with one or more preverbs, which
typically appear(s) in aspectually perfective forms 6 (which in gross terms
may be taken to mean screeves other than those of the Prešent Sub-Series,
though there are exceptions predominantly with preverbless Series 11
formations). A problem is that, apart from with verbs of motion, it is almost
always impossible to predict which preverb(s) a given root will select. Also
the lexical meaning to be assigned to a particular verb-form is often a
function not just of the root but of the union of root with this or that
preverb (some other concomitant changes, such as to the Thematic Suffix
or Version vowel, may also occur). Examples: out of the basic root c'er we
can produce such Future Indicatives as: (i) da-(Ø-)c'er-s PREV-(Y-)write-
X'X will write (Y)', (ii) mi-(Ø-)s-c'er-s PREV-(Y-)Z-write.to-X 'X will write

     'we shall put a cover over the wine storage-jar'     The formation of screeves for Transitive and Intransitive Verbs will be
given according to a division based on Thematic Suffix—roots which do not
accommodate a Thematic Suffix are called Root Verbs, though one might
equally style them Athematic.
     Sometimes a change of preverb does not alter the lexical meaning of
the verbal complex but introduces a special nuance. For example, the
preverb da- often substitutes for a root's usual preverb if some notion of
plurality is involved, most simply seen in the following example where a
singular subject is replaced with a plural, viz. k'vercx-i ga-laq'-d-a
egg-NOM PREV-addled-become-it(AOR)            'the egg became addled' vs
k'vercx-eb-i da-laq'-d-a egg-Pl-NOM                 PREV-addled-become-
3rd.PER(AOR)       'the eggs became addled'. In the following case the
replacement-preverb reduces the effect of the verbal action, viz. k'ar-i
ga-v-(Ø-)a-g-e door-NOM PREV-I-(it-)NV-open-INDIC(AOR) 'I opened
the door' vs k'ar-i še-v-(Ø-)a-g-e 'I opened the door ajar', cf. kal-i
ga-suk-d-a woman-NOM PREV-fat-becomeshe(AOR)             'the woman grew
fat' vs kal-i mo-suk-d-a 'the woman put on a little weight'.
     Suppletion exists. It may be determined by (a) screeve (Sub-)Series (e.g.
v-(Ø-)amb-ob I-(X-)say-TS(PRES) 'I say X' vs v-(Ø-)i-t'q'v-i I-(X-)SV-
say-lNDlC(FUT) 'I shall say X' vs v-(Ø-)tkv-i I-(X-)say-INDIC(AOR) 'I
said X'—sometimes alteration to a verb's classification combines with
suppletion as in the case of what is formally the Intransitive Prešent ra-s
(Ø-Ø-)Svr-eb-i? what?-DAT (you-it-)do-TS-INDIC(PRES) 'what are you
doing?' becoming the Transitive Future ra-s (Ø-Ø-)i-zam? what?-DAT
(you-it-)SV-do(FUT) 'what will you do?' or again the Transitive Aorist ra
(Ø-Ø-)ken-i? what(NOM) (you-it-)do-INDIC(AOR) 'what did you do?';
alternatively we can illustrate a shift from Indirect verb in the Prešent

     'everyone opposes this'
126                         GEORGIANGRAMMARwhereas at other times it is the Dative nominal which fulfils this function,

     woman-DAT child-NOM along (she-)IOV-have-TS-it(FUT)

      you(DAT) not(PROH) (PREV-)you-I OV-be.shy-TS-X(PRES)
      'don't you be shy (sc. of doing X)!')   Some formally intransitive (deponent) verb-forms are construed with
what appears to be a direct object, e.g.      e + s xe            k ' a r g vašl-eb-s          (?0-)i-jl-ev-a

would stand in the Nominative, whilst the indirect object remains Dative,
prescriptive grammar (to which speech does not always conform—see 5.1.7)
requires that such nominals remain Dative, e.g.      mo+nadir+e     mgvdel-s      mo-(?Ø-Ø-)u-q'v-a

verb possesses forms for the Series 111 screeves, these often revert to

cases either a gap exists or the missing screeve is filled by a variant-form
of the root in question; alternatively, suppletion might occur. These
together with all the other morphological particularities and peculiarities of
theGEORGIANverbal system will be described later in this chapter.

Transitives and Medišis and with Indirect verbs in general will be
described later. l e t us take as model of an Intransitive verb the passive

its role as passive-marker followed by the root followed by a Thematic
Suffix) and illustrate subject-marking in the Prešent, Future and Aorist

      'I am being killed'       'I shall be killed'            'I was killed'    We see that with no preverb, as in the Prešent, the subject pronominal
affix of the 1st person stands first in the complex, preceding any pre-
radical vowel that may be used, whereas it follows any preverb(s) that may
be prešent. If the subject is plural, then the pluralising exponent -t is
added at the end of the complex, to give:

can demonstrate subject-marking for a Transitive verb—the prešence of
the zero-morph from the Set B affixal set in the following verb-forms points
to the prešence of a 3rd person direct object (singular or plural):   Prešent                   Future                     Aorist

Prescriptively, only a 3rd person human plural noun will impose its plurality
on the verb, other 3rd person plurals selecting the 3rd person singular

      'Germany, France and Italy border this country directly'   The opposite phenomenon whereby a human plural subject does not
impose its plurality on the verb is attested in the Memoirs of the great
writer from Western Georgia, Davit K'ldiashvili, viz.      m+sur+v+el-eb-ši     moxuc-n-i-c         k'i    mravl+ad

    let us now turn to the Set B affixes. First we note that to mark 3rd
person direct objects the zero-allomorph alone is used and that
prescriptively the plurality of such 3rd person direct objects is never
indicated, though in practice one does come across such examples as:      e+s           (ma-t)      (Ø-)a-xasiat-eb-t

the object is indicated for 'kill' in the Prešent, Future and Aorist:   Prešent                   Future                      Aorist

   'X kills them'            'X will kill them'          'X killed them'    The affixes are seen to occupy the same positions relative to the other
exponents as do the affixes of Set A. Where both the 3rd person singular
subject-suffix and the direct object pluraliser are prešent, they occur in
this order (as in the sequence -a-t here from the Aorist). But where the
expected sequence is -s-t (as in earlier forms ofGEORGIANwe would here
have had (mo-)g-k'l-av-s-t 'X kills (will kill) you PI.'), the Set A subject-
suffix is deleted. As to the number of the 3rd person object, it is left to
the context to determine whether forms like (Ø-)k'l-av-s etc.. are
construed with a singular or plural direct object.
    We now have to consider how this picture is complicated when
combinations other than with 3rd person singular subject occur. Assuming
that a subject-prefix would indeed precede a direct object-prefix, the
sequence of v - g - anticipated for a meaning like 'I kill you' is never
realised because the subject-affix is dropped before the object-marker
-g-, viz.

   'I kill you'                'I shall kill you'           'I killed you'      I f we now add to such forms the pluraliser -t to give:      g-k'1-av-t              mo-g-k'1-av-t                  mo-g-k'al-i-twe produce forms that are polysemous, for they could be interpreted as: (i)
'I kill/shall kill/killed you Pl.', where the pluraliser is part of the 2nd person
exponent from Set B, or (ii) 'we kill/shall kill/killed you', where the
pluraliser is part of the 1st person exponent from Set A, or (iii) 'we
kill/shall kill/killed you Pl"", where an expected final sequence of -t-t has
been simplified by loss of one of the dentals but it is unclear which one—in
the Prešent and Future the forms here may have as a fourth reading the
one given earlier, namely 'X kills/will kill you Pl', which arises out of the
loss of - s - from Set A when followed by -t.
     There are no problems with combinations of 2nd person subject and 1st
person direct object, e.g.      (Ø-)m-k'l-av           mo-(Ø-)m-k'l-av               mo-(Ø-)m-k'al-i
      'you kill me'          'you will kill me'            'you killed me'

      (Ø-)gv-k'l-av-t        mo-(Ø-)gv-k'l-av-t             mo-(Ø-)gv-k'al-i-t
      'you Pl kill us'       'you Pl will kill us'         'you Pl killed us'    Similarly there are no problems with the combinations of 3rd person
plural subject with (i) 1st person singular or plural and (ii) 2nd person
singular direct objects, e.g.      m-k'1-av-en             mo-m-k'l-av-en               mo-m-k'1-es
      'they kill me'          'they will kill me'          'they killed me'
      gv-k'1-av-en            mo-gv-k'1-av-en              mo-gv-k'1-es
      'they kill us'          'they will kill us'          'they killed us'
      g-k'1-av-en             mo-g-k'1-av-en               mo-g-k'1-es
      'they kill you'         'they will kill you'         'they killed you'    However, since the pluraliser -t may not stand after any of the 3rd
person plural allomorphs -(a/e)n/es/nen of Set A, the forms in the last

singular or plural.
    This brings us to the marking of indirect objects. The Set B affixes are
again employed, except that now the alternative allomorphs for the 3rd
person come into play according to the rule prešented in 2.2.7, namely: the
base- (=historically oldest) morph h- assimilates to s- when immediately
followed by any of -c, -c', - j , -č, -č', - j , -t, -t', -d, being retained as
h - before -k, -k', -g, -q', - p ' 1 3 ; before other consonants or a vowel the
zero-allophone is used. However, if until around the 2nd World War the
allophones s-, h- were still possible between 1st person subject-marker v-
and the root-initial consonant (e.g. mi-v-s-c'er 'I shall write to X/them',
v-h-q'v-eb-i 'I follow X/them'), today this is in general no longer true, so
that these examples would now be rendered respectively as: mi-v-c'er,
v-q'v-eb-i. Examples are from the Future Indicative forms of the
Transitive verb 'write to' and of the Intransitive verb 'follow':  mo-(Ø-)g-c'er                   mo-(Ø-Ø14 -)m-c'er           mi 1 5 -(0-0-)s-

     We have not yet discussed the bracketed 3rd person pluraliser from
Set B or what happens with transitive verbs when both direct and indirect
object would require a non-zero pronominal prefix within the verbal
complex, a couplingGEORGIANseems to prefer to avoid. As regards the
pluraliser, prescriptive rules require that Transitive Verbs simply never
mark the plurality of a 3rd person indirect object, which is why all forms
given above for 'write to' with 3rd person indirect object were glossed as
'to X/them'. I have come across only two examples where the plurality of a
3rd person indirect object is marked with this -t on a transitive verb; the
first is from lit'erat'uruli sakartvelo (29 March 1991, p.2):      xm-eb-i-c,            roml-eb-sa-c        asak'-i      ar
      voice-Pl-NOM-too which-Pl-DAT-REl         age-NOM      not

      'the voices too to which age does not give the means to express their
      wish...'where one would have expected (Ø-Ø-)a-jl-ev-s. The second is from
Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's lord of Rach'a. The verb is one of those which are
Transitive but lack a direct object, their second argument being the
indirect object, viz.      m+sm+en+el-eb-s       žriant'el-ma      da-(?Ø-Ø-)u-ar-a-t
      listener-Pl-DAT       shudder-ERG       PREV-(?3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)OV-run.

      'a shudder ran through the audience'    However, if the verb is a bipersonal intransitive, it is indeed possible to
mark the plurality of the 3rd person indirect object as long as the subject
of the verb is 3rd person singular, so that 'X will follow them' could be
either mi-h-q'v-eb-a or mi-h-q'v-eb-a-t. An attested example of this
feature with this very root, though with a different preverb, comes from

     'From their own root only the Prešent Indicative (etc..) are formed for
     bipersonal Stative verbs'    Whatever factor may determine the prešence vs abšence of this
pluraliser, a consideration of these examples reveals that it cannot simply
be the prešence vs abšence of the plural indirect object in the clause, or
whether the plural indirect object precedes or follows its verb.
    More will be said when describing the formation of Series 111 for
Transitive and Medial verbs and of Indirect verbs in general about the use
with them of the two sets of pronominal affixes, but it is appropriate to
note at this point that, since with these forms the Dative nominal functions
as subject and the Nominative as direct object, the Set B affixes reprešent
the subject, whilst the Set A affixes correlate with the direct object. As
plural 3rd person human subjects impose their plurality on the verb, in
these instances the plurality of the Dative nominal will always be marked
on the verb by the suffixal -t if the Dative noun is human and if the direct
object is 3rd person (N.B. the plurality of the Nominative nominal is just
ignored as far as verbal agreement is concerned), e.g.     m+š+ob+el-s (Ø-)u-q'var-s                šv+il-i            /

     The parents love the child/children'where 'love' is an Indirect verb inGEORGIAN.In earlier stages of the
language, however, such examples would have marked the plurality of the
Nominative nominal and ignored that of the Dative, viz.      m+š+ob+el-s (Ø-)u-q'var-an                     šv+il-eb-i
      parent-DAT     (3rd.PER-)OV-love-Pl(PRES)      child-Pl-NOM

      parent-Pl-DAT     (3rd.PER-)OV-love-Pl(PRES)         child-Pl-NOM
      The parents love the children'   This suggests that during the course of its historyGEORGIANhas shifted
subject-status from the Nominative to the Dative nominal for these verb-
forms. There are two interesting illustrations in KEGl of what is
manifestly a bivalent Intransitive verb, namely 'be born to'. The first
comes from the great 19th century writer Ilia t'avč'avadze:      si+t'q'v+a-n-i      gul-ši        m-e-bad-eb-i-an
      word-Pl-NOM         heart-in     me-I OV-be.born-TS-PRES.INDIC-Pl
      'Words/Speeches are born to me in the heart (= are born in my heart)'where the old plural of the (non-human) subject imposes its plurality on the
verb 16 . This contrasts with the following from Ch'avch'avadze's equally
great contemporary, Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli:      šv+il-eb-i          (Ø-)e-bad-eb-a-t
      child-Pl-NOM        (3rd.PER-)I OV-be.born-TS-Srd.PER-Pl
                            VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                            139   'Children are born to them'where the human Nominative subject imposes no plurality on the verb,
being indicated by the Set A singular suffix -a-, whilst the Dative indirect
object has its plurality shewn by -t, just as if this were an Indirect verb,
which it palpably is not 17 . Thus, one cannot take the mere prešence of this
pluraliser with a 3rd person entity as an indicator that the 3rd person
entity in question is viewed as the subject of the verb-form.
    As already stated, this pluraliser for a 3rd person Dative nominal
should, according to prescriptivists, be found only when the Nominative
nominal is itself 3rd person. Once again, however, one does come across
instances where the pluraliser appears with 1st or 2nd person Nominative
nominals. Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's autobiography furnishes the examples:   da-v-(Ø-)u-brun-eb-i-v-a+r-t                          sopel-ši     da

   me(NOM) sometimes second-DAT-to
   'Sometimes they used to take me to one, sometimes to the other'where we would have expected none of the final dentals.
    How, then, doesGEORGIANavoid having two non-zero Set B affixes
within a single verbal complex, as one would expect in the translation of
clauses like 'they give you to me'?GEORGIANavoids the difficulty by
paraphrasing one of the nominals as a 3rd person NP, which, of course,
takes a zero as its coreferential affix in the verb. The phrase in question
consists of the appropriate case of the noun tav-i 'head; self' preceded by
the possessive adjective of the paraphrased pronoun. This periphrasis then
substitutes for the direct object pronoun, e.g.   šen-i    m+s'+ob+l-eb-i  šen-s  tav-s                 (Ø-)m-a-jl-ev-en

      'our parents give us to you'    This periphrasis will even be used where the indirect object is 3rd
person, asGEORGIANseems to have a preference for interpreting a 1st or
2nd person pronominal prefix on a trivalent verb as the marker of indirect
rather than direct objecthood, e.g.      čem-i     m+š+ob+l-eb-i čem-s tav-s             ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s

      (3rd.PER-her-)lV-entrust-TS-they(PRES)
      'my parents are entrusting me/handing me over to the teacher'    However, where the context makes it clear which nominal is the direct
and which the indirect object, this rule may be ignored—for instance, if I
am the child, it is unlikely that my parents would be entrusting the teacher
to me, and so one might hear in place of the above čem-i m+š+ob+1-eb-i
ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s m-(Ø-)a-bar-eb-en, even if prescriptively this
sequence should be interpreted as though the verb were to be analysed
(Ø-)m-a-bar-eb-en with the šense 'they are entrusting X/them to me'.
KEGl provides an example of the verb 'introduce X to Y' with the
periphrastic rule observed, viz.

      'we always imagined there to be loaves in the chest if a harvestless

Intransitives it is usual for a preverb to be prešent in the verbal complex.
In Series II, however, and less commonly perhaps in Series III, one may
find finite Transitive (very rarely Intransitive) verbs without the expected
preverb. The nuance attaching to such forms is that an action, expressed
as aspectually non-durative (hence the use of Series II), nevertheless does
not reach its natural conclusion, which would motivate the prešence of the
preverb as marker of perfective aspect. Consider the contrast between
preverbless and preverbal forms in the proverb:      tagv-ma       (Ø-)txar-a,            (Ø-)txar-a,          k'at'a

   'this is not an affair that is easily to be accomplished, but it is
   demanded of you that we do it' (Literary Georgia, 18 Jan 1991, p.7)    At first glance this would appear to refer to a quite specific affair and
therefore to require the preverb ga-. However, the previous šentence
reads: 'It is our duty to purify the path for the national movement of all
sorts of falsehood and overpower on this road the enemy's tricks,
deceptions and illusions'. In other words, the sa + km + e in question
involves a whole series of individual actions, the fulfilment of each one of
which will not necessarily result in the completion of the series overall,
hence the lack of the preverb.
    Just as in the Future Participle of the last example, the non-finite
verbal noun (Masdar) may be used without the anticipated preverb. The
following examples from a single article in the paper droni Times' (11 Oct
1991, p.7) shew how difficult it can be to distinguish between preverbal and
preverbless forms, for in both instances we have the same verbal root
dependent upon the main verb 'begin', and yet one occurrence has the
preverb, whilst the other lacks it, viz.   p'at'imr-eb-ma      k'ar-eb-is      ga-mo-mt'vr-ev-a

      'X began to shatter the door leading out of the building that was locked
      from the outside'   One might argue from a logical perspective that talk of the beginning of
any action cannot be the appropriate moment to emphasise perfective
aspect for the relevant activity. However, it is clearly the case that
masdars dependent on this verb more often than not will indeed carry their
preverb (cf. from the self-same article:      da-(Ø-)-c'q'-o              sak'n-eb-ši leib-eb-is

      PREV-burn-MASD(NOM) and outside            PREV-PREV-hurl-MASD(NOM)
      'X began to burn the mattresses in the cells and to hurl them outside')     If, as we have seen, it is often not possible to predict which preverb
will be employed for a given root or why a switch to another preverb
should result in the precise change of meaning that on this or that occasion
will occur, it is nevertheless true that some preverbs have come to be
associated with a particular nuance which they introduce into the
semantics of a verb-form when they replace the root's normal preverb. It
is now time to look at these interesting nuances.
     In addition to the example given in the introductory section of this
chapter for Se- marking the application of the verbal action to only a
slight degree, theGEORGIANDictionary of Morphemes quotes: še-ten-d-a
'dawn broke somewhat' vs ga-ten-d-a 'dawn broke', še-šr-a 'X dried a
little' vs ga-šT-a 'X dried', še-xm-a 'X dried up a little' vs ga-xm-a 'X
dried up', še-c'itl-d-a 'X turned slightly red' vs ga-c'itl-d-a 'X turned
red', še-tvr-a 'X got a bit drunk' vs da-tvr-a 'X got drunk'.
     Further examples of the parallel nuance introduced this time by m o -
from the same Dictionary are: mo-rbil-d-a (= še-rbil-d-a) 'X softened a
bit' vs da-rbil-d-a 'X softened', mo-mc'ar-d-a 'X turned a little bitter'
                              VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                163vs ga-mc'ar-d-a 'X turned bitter', mo-mšav-d-a 'X turned a little sour'
vs da-mžav-d-a 'X turned sour'. Also given under the same rubric are
three more denominal verbs, but this time the preverb is followed by the
Subjective Version vowel and the forms in question are restricted (at least
for the relevant meanings) to the Prešent Sub-Series, a restriction that
does not apply to the earlier examples: mo-i-junc'-eb-s 'X is somewhat
mean', mo-i-sust'-eb-s 'X is somewhat weak', mo-i-did-eb-s 'X is
somewhat big', to which can be added mo-i-k'oč'l-eb-s 'X is somewhat
lame'. Note the same initial sequence of morphemes in the (Serially
unrestricted) verbs of the following expressions: tav-s mo-i-k'at , (?+)un-
eb-s 'X makes him/herself out to be innocent', a synonym of which is
tav-s mo-i-sa+c'q+1-eb-s <= sa+c'q'+al-i 'wretched, miserable'; cf.
tav-s mo-i-m+]in+ar-eb-s 'X pretends to be asleep' <= m + jin + are
'sleeping', tav-s mo-i-m+k'vd+ar-un-eb-s 'X pretends to be dead' <=
m+k'vd+ar-i 'dead'. Keeping this same initial sequence, one can use as
the verbal root the name of a town to produce a verb-form meaning
'find/enjoy TOWN'; such verbs are often used in the past and in questions
of the type: ro+gor mo-(Ø-)i-soxum-e? 'How did you find/enjoy/get on
in Sukhum?', ro+gor mo-(Ø-)i-tbilis-e? 'How did you find/enjoy/get on in
Tbilisi?'.
    With some Medial verbs mo- has a special function. Medišis typically
take no preverb in any Series, but the addition of mo- to any of the three
Prešent Sub-Series screeves of the relevant Medišis produces expressions
meaning 'come VERBing' (e.g. (i-)mger-i-s 'X sings' => mo-i-mger-i-s 'X
comes singing', t a m a š - o b - s 'X plays' => m o - t a m a š - o b - s 'X comes
playing', t'ir-i-s 'X cries' => mo-t'ir-i-s 'X comes crying', xox-av-s 'X
crawls' => mo-xox-av-s 'X comes crawling', Ht'v-i-s 'X seeks refuge' =>
mo-i-lt'v-i-s 'X comes seeking refuge'). One can sometimes additionally
indicate the prešence of an indirect object recipient of the verbal activity
(usually the emission of some sort of sound) simply adding a Set B affix (e.g.
q'vir-i-s 'X shouts' => mo-q'vir-i-s 'X comes shouting' => mo-h-q'vir-i-s
'X comes after/follows Y shouting (sc. at Y)', q'iv-i-s 'X crows' => mo-
q'iv-i-s 'X comes crowing' => mo-h-q'iv-i-s 'X comes crowing at Y').
     For the root -bed- 'dare' the usual preverb is ga- (as in i+s ro+gor
ga-(Ø-Ø-)bed-e/ga-(Ø-Ø-)m-i-bed-e? 'how did you dare that/dare (do)
that to me?'). If we change the preverb to mo-, we produce a short-hand
way of saying 'dare to come here' (e.g. ro+gor mo-(0-?0-)bed-e? =
mo+svl+a ro+gor ga-(Ø-Ø-)bed-e? 'how did you dare to come here?').
By using še- we produce a short-hand for 'dare to go in', though with an
indirect object attached, the verb means 'dare/deign to do/say something
to someone' (as in:

'you (will) dare/deign to do/say X/them to Y/them' (cf. the common
expression ro+gor g-e-k'adr-eb-a-t?! 'how can you say/even think of
(saying) such a thing?!').
    The preverb mi- is similarly employed with the Prešent Sub-Series
screeves of some Medišis to indicate the opposite orientation (e.g. m i -
tamaš-ob-s 'X goes playing', mi-k'iv-i-s 'X goes screaming', mi-h-k'iv-
i-s 'X goes after/follows Y screaming (at Y)').
    Consideration of the special functions of da- can begin with the
observation that, where a Medial's activity in the Prešent Sub-Series takes
place not hither or thither but 'all around', then da- is attached (e.g. da-
tamaš-ob-s 'X moves around playing', but in this case when an indirect
object is prešent, the Thematic Suffix alters to give da-s-tama š-eb-s 'X
plays around Y', da-seirn-ob-s 'X walks around', da-k'unt'ruš-ob-s 'X
capers about', da-laklak-ob-s 'X goes around prattling', da-(5'or+a-
ob-s 'X goes around spreading rumours', da-t'rial-eb-s 'X spins around,
works at speed'). When this preverb is used, there is often a hint of its
original directional force 'down' (e.g. da-s-t'rial-eb-s 'X spins/fusses
around/over Y', da-s-t'rp-i-s = da-s-t'rp+ial-eb-s 'X behaves lovingly
over/towards Y', da-h-q'iv-i-s 'X crows down at Y', da-s-t'ir-i-s 'X
looks down and cries over Y', da-gručun-eb-s 'X goes around grunting/X
grunts down over Y', da-h-q'ašq'aš-eb-s 'X (eagle, etc..) barks down at
Y', da-h-q'mu-i-s 'X moos over Y', da-mger-i-s 25 'X sings over Y', which
as a verb with a full paradigm means 'sing to the accompaniment of an
instrument', as shewn by:      da-(0-?0-)u-k , r-a                   st'vir-i,  ze+da-c

p'ar-eb-a 'X comes thieflike' and mi-i-p'ar-eb-a 'X goes thieflike',
though KEGl also quotes a full paradigm for this latter in the šense of
'sneak somewhere').
    Perhaps the above-usages of da- might just be subsumed under the
general heading of intensification of the verbal activity, which is often
conveyed by this preverb—an action carried on in more than one direction
might be regarded as an intensification or pluralising of that action.
However, the property of intensification/pluralisation is most clearly seen
when da- substitutes for the normal preverb to underline the plurality of a
Transitive Verb's direct object or an Intransitive Verb's subject. Schmidt
devoted an early article (1957) to this very topic, styling it a South
Caucasian 'Aktionsart'. He quoted a whole list of cases, either elicited or
from KEGl, of da- substituting for other preverbs in cases of plurality
(including instances where the nuance is translateable as 'VERBing to and
from/around' and noting where plurality occasions suppletion of the verbal
root itself), observing that most often da- seems to replace ga- in
Transitive Verbs (e.g. ga-gzavn-i 'you will šend one X' vs da-gzavn-i
'you will šend them', ga-jarcv-av 'you will rob one X' vs da-jarcv-av
'you will rob them', ga-rand-av 'you will plane one X' vs da-rand-av
'you will plane them', ga-bt'q'vn-i 'you will pluck one X' vs da-bt'q'vn-i
'you will pluck them'). Prešented separately were other alternations,
including those for Intransitives (e.g. gada-q'lap'-av 'you will swallow
one X' vs da-q'lap'-av 'you will swallow them', mo-lok'-av = ga-lok'-av
'you will lick one X clean' vs da-lok'-av 'you will lick them clean', m o - h -
p'ar-av 'you will steal one X from Y' vs da-h-p'ar-av 'you will steal
them from X', mo-k'1-av 'you will kill one X' vs (with change of root!) da-
xoc-av 'you will kill them', ga-ǰavr-d-eb-a 'X will grow angry' vs da-
ǰavr-d-eb-i-an 'they will grow angry'). Schmidt observed that in addition
to marking the plurality of a direct object, the prešence of da- might
indicate that the verbal activity is applied more than once to the single
object or that the single object ends up in many pieces (e.g. ga-xetk 'you
will split one X' vs da-xetk 'you will split them/one X many times', ga-t'ex
'you will break one X' vs da-t'ex 'you will break them/one X into many
pieces').
    gada- may replace a root's normal preverb to indicate that the verbal
166                        GEORGI AN GRAMMARaction is carried out thoroughly or to excess or for a second time, in which
last instance it equates to 're-' (e.g. da-xarǰ-av 'you will spend X/them' =>
gada-xarǰ-av 'you will overspend X/them', da-gl-i 'you will tire X/them'
=> gada-gl-i 'you will overtire X/them', da-a-mlaš-eb 'you will make
X/them (over-)salty' => g a d a - a - m l a š - e b 'you will make X/them
excessively salty/will overstep the mark', da-c'v-av 'you will burn X/them'
=> gada-c'v-av 'you will burn X/them to a cinder', ga-sinǰ-av 'you will
examine X/them' => gada-sinǰ-av 'you will examine thoroughly/re-examine
X/them', mo-xn-av 'you will plough X/them' => gada-xn-av 'you plough
thoroughly/re-plough X/them', da-a-muša-v-eb 'you will work X/them
over' => gada-a-muša-v-eb 'you will re-work X/them', d a - a - r k m - e v
'you will give a name to X/them' => gada-a-rkm-ev 'you will re-name
X/them', i-t'q'v-i 'you will say X/them' => g a d a - t k v - a m 'you will
renounce what you said', i-pikr-eb 'you will think' => gada-i-pikr-eb
'you will change your mind', i-angariš-eb 'you will work out a sum' =>
gada-i-angariå-eb 'you will re-do a sum).
    gada- may also indicate the superficiality of the verbal action (e.g
xel-s da-i-ban 'you will wash your hands' => xel-s gada-i-ban 'you will
give your hands a cat-lick', da-a-tval+ier-eb 'you will look over/examine
X/them' => gada-a-tval+ier-eb = tval-s gada-a-vl-eb 'you will give
X/them a cursory inspection').
    While not lending any special nuance, the preverb a- is especially
common, though not unique, as the perfectivising exponent for Intransitive
inceptive verbs formed from Medial roots (e.g. i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will
speak' => a-lap'arak'-d-eb-i 'you will begin to speak', i-mger-eb 'you
will sing' => a-mger-d-eb-i 'you will start to sing', i-t'ir-eb 'you will cry'
=> a-t'ir-d-eb-i 'you will start to cry').
    The preverb c'a- in combination with the Subjective Version vowel is
especially common with Medial roots to indicate the marginal
accomplishment of the verbal action and will be re-prešented at greater
length in the description of the Medials (e.g. with the Medial i-sauzm-eb
'you will have breakfast' => c'a-i-sauzm-eb 'you will snatch a bit of
breakfast' compare the non-Medial č'am 'you (will) eat X/them' => c'a-i-
č'am 'you snatch a bite to eat').
     c'a- may also serve to indicate that the activity affects the end or
edge of something (e.g. mo-s-č'r-i = mo-a-č'r-i 'you will cut X off Y' =>
c'a-a-č'r-i = c'a-s-č'r-i 'you will cut a small piece X off the end of Y',
mo-s-č'am = mo-a-č'am 'you will eat X off Y' => c'a-s-č'am 'you will eat
top/bottom X off Y', mi-a-b-am 'you will tie X to Y' => c'a-a-b-am 'you
will tie X onto the end of Y thereby extending Y', mi-a-c'eb-eb 'you will
glue X onto Y' => c'a-a-c'eb-eb 'you will glue X onto the end of Y thereby
                                   VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                       167extending Y').
     There seems to be a roughness or something uncomplimentary involved
when c'a- replaces ga-mo- in the case of ga-mo-a-rtm-ev 'you will
take X off Y' vs c'a-a-rtm-ev 'you will snatch X off Y'.
     The preverb c'a-mo- can also indicate the restricted nature of the
verbal activity (e.g. i-c'vim-eb-s 'it will rain' => c'a-mo-c'vim-s 'there
will be a short rainfall', ga-i-zrd-eb-a 'X will grow' => c'a-mo-i-zrd-eb-
a 'X will grow a bit', k'b+il-i a-g-t'k'iv-d-eb-a 'your tooth will start to
ache' => k'b+il-i c'a-mo-g-t'k'iv-d-eb-a 'your tooth will start to give
you a little pain'). Note, however, c'a-mo-d'arxl-d-eb-i 'you will turn
beetroot red' <= č'arxal-i 'beetroot'.
     c'a-mo- is often found with the Subjective Version vowel, especially
with basically Medial roots, indicating the sudden and swift nature of the
activity (e.g. c'a-mo-i-jax-eb 'you will suddenly shout out', i-q'ep-eb-s
'X will bark' => da-i-q'ep-eb-s 'X will give a bark' => c ' a - m o - i - q ' e p -
eb-s 'X will suddenly let out a bark'). But this nuance is not limited to
Medial derivatives (e.g. da-i-c'q'-eb 'you will begin X/them' vs c'a-mo-
i-c'q'-eb 'you will suddenly begin X/them', a-i-nt-eb-a 'X will light up' vs
c'a-mo-i-nt-eb-a 'X will suddenly light up').
     Perhaps the most interesting case of a special nuance attaching to a
preverb concerns š e - m o - (sometimes just še-). This preverb shews that
the verbal action is committed by an unwilling agent (see Potsxishvili 1969;
Dzhorbenadze 1983:96-97), and not only does še-mo- replace the verb's
normal preverb but the active Transitive Verb is made Intransitive
(passive) and the unwilling agent is reprešented as indirect object of this
 Intransitive verb-form, sometimes in association with the e-versioniser and
in other cases with the locative Version-vowel depending on the
intransitive morphology characteristic of that root, as will be explained
later in this chapter (e.g. mo-v-k'1-av 'I shall kill X' => š e - m o - m - a -
k'vd-eb-a 'I shall unwittingly kill X', which Intransitive is based on m o -
k'vd-eb-a 'X will die' rather than on mo-i-k'vl-eb-a 'X will be killed';
ga-cvet 'you will wear out X/them' => še-mo-g-a-cvd-eb-a = še-mo-
g-e-plit-eb-a = š e - m o - g - e - x - e v - a = š e - m o - g - e - p x r i c ' - e b - a 'you
will unwittingly wear/tear X/them to rags'; da-a-mt'vr-ev 'you will

še-mo-g-e-pšvn-eb-a 'you will unwittingly shatter X/them'; da-xarǰ-av
'you will spend X/them' => še-mo-g-e-xarǰ-eb-a = še-mo-g-e-č'am-

=> še-mo-g-e-tl-eb-a 'you will unwittingly whittle X/them'; da-č""r-i 'you

ga-lanjg-av 'you will insult X/them' => še-mo-g-e-lanjg-eb-a 'you will
168                       GEORGI AN GRAMMARunwittingly insult X'; ga-t'ex 'you will break X/them' => še-(mo-)g-a-
t'q'd-eb-a 'you will unwittingly break X/them'; ga-lax-av 'you will beat

will unwittingly extinguish a light').
     No mention has yet been made of the alternative forms of some of the
preverbs from the earlier list. In general the variants, each with a
bracketed extra letter, reprešent the older forms of the relevant preverbs.
Occasionally the older form is retained with certain verb-forms, sometimes
both the older and the newer forms will be in use, though there will either
be a difference in meaning or the older form will lend an archaic flavour or
higher style to the form in question.
     For ag- we can note that ag+dg+om+a is retained in the šense of
'Easter' whereas the Masdar for 'standing up' today is a-dg-om-a; ag-
k'vec-a indicates 'blessing into the priesthood', whilst a-k'vec-a is today
'shortening (e.g. someone's hair)'; ag+c'er+il+oba is the only word for
'description'. Often forms with the older variant are possible even in the
Prešent Sub-Series (a) for roots never found without this preverb, or (b)
where ag- in the Prešent Sub-Series contrasts with a- elsewhere (e.g. ag-
nišn-av-s 'it means X', ag-ricx-av-s = ag-nusx-av-s 'X enumerates
Y/them', ag-beč'd-av-s 'X leaves behind an imprint of Y', ag-a-gzn-
eb-s = ag-a-nt-eb-s 'X fires/rouses Y/them' vs a-a-gzn-eb-s = a-a-
nt-eb-s 'X will fire/rouse Y/them'). According to the Dictionary of
Morphemes, because of confusion about word-divisions as the older form
was shifting to the newer, the back fricative became attached as part of
the root in a number of cases (such as mi-a-g(+)c'-ev 'you will reach
X/them'—the writer D. K'ldiashvili, who died as late as 1931, used the
original form of the root, as in ra+t'om mi-a-c'-i-a a+m dge-mde?
'why did X survive upto this day?'; in olderGEORGIAN'I confess/
acknowledge' was ag-v-i-a+r-eb, whereas today it is v-a-g(+)i(+)a(+)r-
eb—KEGl has for its entry of 3rd person singular Prešent-Future, Aorist
and Perfect forms: agiarebs, agiara, aguarebia, with the added note in
brackets [and not: agviarebs, ... ugiarebial; V. Topuria and I.
Gigineishvili's 1968 Orthographic Dictionary, on the other hand, gives the
Perfect as: u g i a r e b i a , which can only be analysed as:        (Ø-)u-
g(+)i(+)a(+)r-eb-i-a, in harmony with the re-interpreted Prešent-Future
form given above).
     Similar observations and examples are possible in the case of gan- (e.g.
'hermit' may only be gan+deg+il-i; 'persecution' is gan+d+ev+n+a-, one
way of saying 'X traversed a path' is to say gza ga-(Ø-)i-a+r-a, but with
the alternative root the preverb must be gan-, namely gza gan-(Ø-)vl-o).
                                 VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                   169lexical differences exist between such pairs as: g a n - c x a d - e b - a
'announcement' and ga-cxad-eb-a 'making clear', gan+c'q'+ob+a 'mood'
and ga-c'q'-ob-a 'unfurling (cloth, bed)'. Occasionally one sees the
example ga-a-n(+)tav+is+up+l-eb 'you will liberate X/them', which
arises out of the older gan-a-tav+is+up+1-eb through a wrong division
of preverbal and radical morphemes in the verbal noun gan-tav+is+up+1-
eb-a 'freeing' during the time when the preverbal nasal was being lost.
gan- itself has, however, come to be associated with certain nuances such
as (a) equate to 'un-', 'de-' or 'dis-' (e.g. gan-iarag-eb-a 'disarming' vs še-
iarag-eb-a 'arming', g a n - t ' v i r t - v - a 'unloading' vs d a - t ' v i r t - v - a
'loading', g a n - m u x t ' - v - a 'de-electrifying', g a n - m a g n i t ' - e b - a 'de­
magnetising') or (b) signify division (e.g. gan-št'o-eb-a 'branching', gan-
dg-om-a 'apostasy', gan-tes-v-a 'seeding', gan+xetk + il+eba 'splitting
up, division').
    garda- is retained in a few cases such as: garda+t'ex+a 'break­
through', garda-i-cval-a 'X passed away' vs gada-i-cval-a 'X was
substituted'.
    c'ar- is similarly retained in a few cases such as: c'ar+sul-i 'the past'
(vs. c'a-sul-i '(having) gone'), c'ar+mat'+eb+a 'success', c'ar-a-dg-en
'you will prešent/shew document(s) X'.
    c'ar-mo- is sometimes used as a high style alternative for c'a-mo-. 11
is also found in certain forms such as: c'ar-mo-a-dg-en 'you (will)
reprešent X/them', c'ar-mo-š-ob-it 'by birth' <= c ' a r - m o - š - o b - a
'creating', c ' a r - m o - t k v - a m 'you (will) declare X', c ' a r - m o - e b - a
'production'.
    Shanidze (1976.72) noted four extra preverbs found in OldGEORGIAN:
uk'un-, u k ' u - m o - , c'iag-, c'iag-mo-. The last two (from c'q'al-i
'water') have been lost completely, but one still finds uk'u- in the
occasional verb-form such as uk'u-a-gd-eb 'you throw X/them back' (cf.
uk'an 'back(wards), behind, after')—note also uk'u+kc+ev+it-i 'reflexive'.
It might be pertinent to note the abstract-noun c'in-svl-a 'progress',
where the adverb c'in 'forward, in front' stands in the position of preverb
with what is clearly the masdar-base of the verb of motion (cf. mo-svl-a
'coming', ga-svl-a 'going out', etc.).
170                        GEORGI AN GRAMMAR4.4 Version (kc+ev+a)This term ('Charaktervokal' in Deeters' terminology), introduced by
Shanidze in 1930, refers to the system wherebyGEORGIANemploys a range
of vowels to indicate certain types of relation holding between the subject
and object or between the direct and indirect objects of the verb. The
system is esšentially limited not only to finite verb-forms but to screeves in
Series I and II, for, where a version-vowel appears in some Series III
screeves, the relevant functions are grammatically obligatory and thus no
longer describable in versional terms. We shall discuss below Neutral
Version, Subjective Version, Objective Version, locative Version, and the
e-versioniser, which I call the Indirect Object Versioniser. The description
will be based on Shanidze's characterisations, though he personally
discussed the so-called locative Version under the verbal category of
'Situation' (Shanidze 1973.373ff.). Aronson (1982a) has queried the very
existence of a category of version for the GEORGI AN verb, whilst
Mač'avariani (1980) has proposed a new analysis based on the opposition:
'introversion' (Subjective Version) vs 'extroversion' (Neutral, Objective and
locative Versions).","[175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]"

By the term 'potential' I mean clauses dependent upon introductory
expressions like 'must, ought, should, want, advise, try, be able, necessary,
possible, preferable, e t c . ' . If a finite reprešentation is required, then
where the proposition relates to the future, the Aorist SUBJunctive is used;
where it relates to the prešent, the Prešent SUBJunctive is used; where it
relates to the past, the Pluperfect is used. The complementiser rom is
optional. The Masdar serves as the non-finite reprešentation in such
expressions.
    The 3rd person Prešent of the verb 'want' (u-nd-a) has been
grammaticalised as the invariant particle of obligation. Prescriptively,
nothing can stand between it and its dependent finite verb—in other words,
rom is never used in this expression, e.g.      male u+nd+a            c'a-[v-jvid-e
      soon it.is.necessary   PREV-[I-jgo-AOR.SUBJ
      'I must go soon'   Should u-nd-a be functioning as the 3rd person Prešent of 'wish', then
rom is optional and other material too may separate main from subordinate
verb, e.g.      masp'injel-s (Ø-)u-nd-a,           (rom) male c'a-[v-jvid-e
      host-DAT      (he-)OV-want-it      that soon PREV-[I-]go-AOR.SUBJ
      The host wants me to go soon'    If the SUBJects of the introductory and subordinate verbs are co-
referential, then Equi-NP-Del may apply to produce the Masdar in place of
the Aorist SUBJunctive, e.g.      masp'injel-s (Ø-)u-nd-a (a)        (rom) da-)d-e-s / /

"Some members of the class may appear with a direct object (e.g.
(Ø-)tamaš-ob 'you are playing' vs čog+burt-s (Ø-Ø-)tamaš-ob 'you are
playing tennis'). However, in ModernGEORGIANthese verbs have acquired
a full set of screeves across the three Series by virtue of borrowing from
variant-forms of their root, specifically, in the words of Shanidze
(1973.§418), they 'turn to the subjective versional form of the active voice
of their very own root in order to fill in their missing forms: cxovrobs,
cxovrobda, cxovrobdes [Prešent and Imperfect Indicatives plus Prešent
Subjunctive of the verb 'live'—BGHÎ but i-cxovrebs, i-cxovra [Future and
Aorist Indicatives of the same verb—BGH]. Today we understand these as
forms of one and the same verb ... but in origin they were different verbs:
i-cxovrebs is the subjective version which has as its neutral version a-
CXOVrebS ['X makes Y live'—BGH1. But this form of the subjective version is
drained of any versional content by virtue of the fact that it has been
deprived of its direct object and, as a verb that has been left objectless,
has become intransitive. Despite this, it has retained two markers of a
transitive verb, the one syntactic, the other morphological: (a) with IInd
Series forms it takes its subject in the Narrative case ..., (b) forms of the
III rd Series are produced through inversion and, linked to this, its subject
stands in the Dative ... The verb acxovra has both subject and direct
object: k'ot'em k'argad acxovra col-švili ['K'ot'e gave wife and child a good
life'—BGH]. By the way, as direct object the reflexive pronoun tavi is also
possible with it [tavs saca unda vacxovreb ['I shall settle myself down
wherever it proves necessary'—BGH] (Vazha Pshavela, V,6,ll). But what
34Ø                       GEORGI AN GRAMMARon earth is the direct object with the subjective versional icxovra man?
['What' did it 'make live'?—seemingly tavi ['itself'—BGH], which was lostt
since it was the one and only [possible object—BGH] and thus easily
understood. Because of the loss of its object the verb lost its transitivity
and thus came to match the Medial and took upon itself the function of
filling the Medial's missing forms. Only its syntactic force in the IInd and
IIIrd Series and the morphological indicator in the III rd Series (inversion)
remind us of its active [sc. voice—BGH] formation'.
     This lengthy quote introduces a number of important features that are
characteristic of the Medial Verbs: the Future Indicative (sc. of Medišis
which have no indirect object associated with them; such 'relative' Medišis
will be discussed separately below) is produced by resorting to the
formant-combination i-...-eb, which is taken by Holisky (1981.1)80 as the
defining phenomenon of the Class81, so that the Future Indicatives 'it will
rain' and 'you will play (tennis)' are (?Ø-)i-c'vim-eb-s and (šog+burt-s)
(Ø-Ø-)i-tamaš-eb; in origin these are active voiced Transitive Verb-
forms in Subjective Version with an understood reflexive tav-i 'head; self'
as direct object 82 , and as such the Conditional and Future Subjunctive are
formed as would one anticipate for any Transitive Verb with Thematic
Suffix -eb; Series 11 and 111 are then formed from such Transitive Verb-
forms (almost!) as one would expect, viz. being characterised by, with one
exception, a Weak Aorist Indicative and in all cases an Aorist Subjunctive
in -o, coupled with Ergative subject throughout Series II, and by Inversion
coupled with Dative subject (and, where applicable, Nominative direct
object) in Series III, so that the Aorist Indicatives 'it rained' and 'you
played (tennis)' are (?Ø-)i-c'vim-a and (čog+burt-i) (Ø-Ø-)i-tamaa-e,
whilst the Perfects are (Ø-)u-c'vim-i-?a and (čog+burt-i) g-i-tamaš-
(n-)i-a; though not stated explicitly, it is clear from the quoted forms that
the Medials do not employ preverbs in the perfective screeves, a fact
which is ascribed by Holisky to their esšentially atelic aspect, which is
incompatible with the basically perfectivising function of the preverbs. I
part company with Shanidze only insofar as he assumes that, once these
forms have been borrowed, they take on the intransitivity of the verb-
forms to which they act as paradigm-fillers. Writing a traditional grammar
in an age when it would have been highly unusual to operate with more
than a single level of description (for his Fundamentals of the Grammar of
theGEORGIANlanguage first appeared as such in 1953 and even then was
based on a number of revisions dating back to a slimmer 214-page volume
of 193Ø), it was not open to Shanidze to posit the prešence underlyingly of
the original direct object tav-i that he clearly regarded as the motivation
for the Subjective Version in the screeves of the Future Sub-Series and of
                             VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                             341Series II (as well as, of course, for the prešence of Inversion in Series III).
We are not today so restricted, and, as I have argued in a number of
places (1983, 1987a, 1989, 1995), it is by taking for granted the esšential
(underlying) transitivity of Medial Verb-forms outside the Prešent Sub-
Series that one arrives at the most convincing account of the morpho-
syntax of Medišis and related phenomena. Where we have such forms as
(?Ø-)i-c'vim-eb-s 'it will rain' or (Ø-)u-c'vim-i-?a 'it apparently rained',
I place a question-mark before the 3rd person morph to shew that there is
no argument external to the verb correlating with it, even though
according to the analysis just advanced I assume that the relevant
argument is prešent underlyingly but obligatorily deleted once the verb's
transitivity has been established and the agreement-markers have been
assigned accordingly.
    In addition to not taking preverbs where one would otherwise have
expected them to occur, the other morphological oddity of Medišis resides
in the fact that, even though almost all of them behave like Transitive
Verbs with Thematic Suffix -eb in the Future Sub-Series and Series II, no
Thematic Suffix appears in the Perfect (or in either of the other two
screeves of Series III), but a strange element -n- may optionally be used 83
immediately after the root in all three Series III screeves for those
Medišis whose root-structure does not make the addition of such a nasal
difficult to pronounce. We have already met such a formant, as with the
Transitive root -t'ac-, where the Perfect may be formed normally or with
the aid of this nasal, e.g.   okro-s      kurd-s       ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-t'ac-eb
   gold-DAT thief-DAT PREV-PREV-(you-it-)him-snatch-TS(FUT)

   'you will snatch the gold from the hand of the thief'=> Aorist okro kurd-s ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-t'ac-e xel-i+dan => Perfect
okro kurd-is-tvis        ga-mo-g-i-t'ac-n-i-a/ga-mo-g-i-t'ac-eb-i-a
xel-i+dan. I have suggested elsewhere (1987b) that this nasal may be the
remnant of an earlier formant -in-, just as in Mingrelian one finds exactly
this sequence sometimes turning up in Series 111 of Medials (e.g. Aorist ti-
k (?Ø-)i-ngar-u =GEORGIANman (?Ø-)i-t'ir-a 'X cried' vs Perfect
ti-s    (Ø-)u-ngar-(in-)?u   =GEORGIANm a - s      (Ø-)u-t'ir-(n-)i-?a 'X
apparently cried'), which I related to the Causative formant, arguing that
the Causative may have been employed to reinforce the Transitive status
of the verb-forms in question, just as today one can point to a number of
342                           GEORGI AN GRAMMARcases where the morphological Causative (see 4.8) does not differ in
meaning from the corresponding non-Causative but Transitive form (e.g.
(Ø-Ø-)a-rb-en = (Ø-Ø-)a-rb-en-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to run').
The reason why the Thematic Suffix -eb- itself cannot be used is that its
prešence would entirely alter the meaning. The reason for this is as
follows: outside the Prešent Sub-Series, as we have stated, Medišis borrow
the Subjective Version variant of a form of their root which otherwise is
produced by means of the a-versioniser in combination with the Thematic
Suffix -eb. We, thus, have such pairs as: (Ø-?Ø-)i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will
speak' vs (Ø-Ø-)a-lap'arak'-eb 'you (will) get X/them to speak'. The
former has the Perfect g - i - l a p ' a r a k ' - ( n - ) i - ? a vs Pluperfect g - e -
lap'arak'-(n-)?a vs III rd Subjunctive g-e-lap'arak'-(n-)o-?s, whereas
the latter has the Perfect g-i-lap'arak'-eb-i-a vs Pluperfect g - e -
lap'arak'-eb-in-a vs III rd Subjunctive g-e-lap'arak'-eb-in-o-s. And
so, we see that with the Thematic Suffix -eb prešent the verb-form
actually has the meaning of the (pseudo-)Causative from which the Medial
(outside the Prešent Sub-Series) is itself derived.
    The one Medial which does not have the Weak conjugation in its Aorist
Indicative is (Ø-Ø-)grjn-ob 'you feel/perceive X/them'. Additionally, this
Medial is one of the exceptions in terms of its Future Sub-Series formation,
for its Future Indicative is (Ø-Ø-)i-grjn-ob. Its Series II screeves
conjugate thus:      Aorist Indicative           Aorist Subjunctive
      v-[Ø-)i-grjen-i             v-(Ø-)i-grjn-o
      (Ø-Ø-)i-grjen-i             (Ø-Ø-)i-grjn-o

      (Ø-Ø-)i-grjen-i-t           (Ø-Ø-)i-grjn-o-t
      (Ø-)i-grjn-es               (Ø-)i-grjn-o-n    Series III is then: Perfect g-i-grjvn-i-a (N.B. the root-expansion),
Pluperfect g-e-grjn-o, III rd Subjunctive g-e-grjn-o-s. Medišis only
ever occur with a 3rd person direct object, and since all Medišis apart
from 'feel' have a Weak Aorist Indicative conjugation ending in -a for a
3rd person singular subject, and since the Pluperfect is formally akin to the
Aorist Indicative, all Medišis apart from 'feel' have Pluperfect ending in -a
(and, of course, III rd Subjunctive in -o-s). To illustrate the full Series II
and 111 paradigms of a 'regular' Medial let us take the verb for 'play (X)':

and Prešent Subjunctive are formed as one would expect, except that
where the Prešent Indicative appears to shew the Thematic Suffix -i (as in

incorporate -od- and not -d- alone (e.g. (Ø-)t'ir-od-i 'you were crying',
(Ø-)t'ir-od-e 'may you be crying'); indeed, in the Prešent Indicative some
speakers add the Prešent Indicative of the copula when a Medial in -i has
a 1st or 2nd person subject, so that 'cry' conjugates thus:   Present Indicative      Imperfect Indicative      Prešent Subjunctive

governing a subjunctive verb.
    Another fossil, originally a finite verb meaning 'it is possible for X', is
e+g+eb(+i+s)/e+g+eb+a, which has as a synonym the parallel fossil from
the still very much extant verb 'it will be' i+kn+eb(+a). The meaning is
'maybe' and the associated verb is usually, though not necessarily,
subjunctive, e.g.   e+g+eb                 (Ø-Ø-)a-job-o-s,           rom a+ma+gam

   a+k da-(0-)rč-e
   here PREV-(you-)stay-AOR.SUBJ
   'maybe it's preferable that tonight you remain here'    Similar to the last two particles is vinjlo, which similarly governs the
Aorist Subjunctive. 11 means 'perhaps' but adds a note of encouragement
for the verbal activity, e.g.   vinjlo ar da-(Ø-Ø-)i-c'un-o                                č'iatura-c

   'maybe you'll catch them alive (and I hope you do/do try to)'    Another verb in origin is lam+i+s 'almost', which has as synonyms
k'inagam or t+i+tk+m+i+s (cf. 5.1.12) or again the full expression cot'a-
ga (Ø-)a-k'l-i-a, rom... 'but little is lacking that...'. It takes the Aorist

Notes
      Cf. c'ign-n-i da-(Ø-)c'er-n-a 'X wrote books', which in Modern GEORGI AN is da-
      (Ø-)c'er-a.
      This pronominal prefix should only coördinate with a Dative indirect object, and so
      should strictly not be prešent if the indirect object is reinterpreted as a direct object.
      For a discussion of this verb see Shanidze (1979.122).
      The relevant verbs (quoted in their OldGEORGIANforms) are: (ag-)a-gzn-eb 'you
      (will) stir up', a-gin-eb 'you (will) swear at', (ga-)a-gril-eb 'you (will) cool', a-
      i+jul-eb 'you (will) compel', (da-)a-k'vir+v-eb 'you (will) surprise', (mo-)a-(m)ši-
      eb 'you (will) make hungry', (da-)a-mjim-eb 'you (will) make heavy', a-mxil-eb 'you
      (will) bring X's bad actions to light', a-rcxu-en 'you (will) put to shame', (da-)a-
      rc'm+un-eb 'you (will) convince', (ag-)a-g-eb 'you (will) raise', (gan-)a-gwij-eb
      'you (will) awaken', (še-)a-urv-eb 'you (will) disturb', ( š ) a - š i n - e b 'you (will)
      frighten', (gan-)a-cin-eb 'you (will) make laugh', a-ct-un-eb 'you (will) lead into
      error', (gan-)a-cxr-ob 'you (will) give relief', (da-)a-)in-eb 'you (will) put to sleep',
      a-c'u-ev 'you (will) call upon X to do Y', a-č'en-eb 'you (will) thrust away', (če-)a-
      č'ir+v-eb 'you (will) upset', (gan-)a-xar-eb 'you (will) give joy to', (da-)a-jer-eb
      'you (will) convince'. For the verb 'curse' the 8-volume kartuli enis ganmart'ebiti
      leksik'oni 'Explanatory Dictionary of theGEORGIANlanguage' (KEGL) quotes an
      example with the reinterpreted second argument as direct object (viz. kmr-is
      sa+c'+ol-i š ( Ø - ) a - g i n - a husband-GEN bed-NOM         PREV-(it-)NV-curšshe(AOR)
      'she cursed [herj husband's bed'), but a letter printed in the organ of the Writers'
      union of 31 March 1989 (page 2) has the 'old' indirect object retained (viz. a+m kuč-

      declined to curse Nodar'). Similarly for the verb 'compel' the now defunct journal of
      the Paris-basedGEORGIANčmigrč-community gušagi 'šentinel' had an example in its
      first issue (April, 1984, page 25) shewing Dative for the entity compelled and
      Nominative for the act they were compelled to perform alongside an Aorist verb-form
      (viz. ..sa+idan (Ø-Ø-)a-i+jul-es gad-mo-xt'-om-a xalx-s               whence (itSrd.PER-)

      '...whence they forced the people to burst through'), whereas one would have
      expected Nominative for the person compelled followed by a subordinate clause (in
      this case, sc. after a past-tense verb, with the Pluperfect of 'burst through').
      The Masdar is q'-ol-a = Mingrelian '-un-a/'w-en-a.

    Dictionary (KEGL), which is why I have prefaced it with a question-mark for this
    particular sense — the form may convey any of the meanings 'it is being written
    for/to/on me' without difficulty, though in these instances it is classified as a bivalent
    I ntransitive.
6   Always assuming that Georgian is correctly described as having such an aspectual
    system — for doubts see Rayfield (1994a).
7   For information on the pluraliser - q ' e found in some dialects see the relevant
    sections of Tuite (1991) or Tuite (1989).
8   The final i-vowel in these forms is a marker of the indicative mood.
9   Some might prefer suppletion to v-i-xoc-eb-i-t           when the underlying patient is
    plural.
10 The only screeves today retaining the voiceless back fricative, which was once the
    universal 2nd person subject indicator, are: the Present of the copula = x-a+r(-t)
    'you (you Pl..) are', and, for the verb of motion, which is here shewn with the preverb
    mo-, the Future Indicative = mo-x-val(-t) 'you (vou Pl.) will come', the Conditional =
    mo-x-vid-od-i(-t) 'you (you P1.) would (have) come', the Future Subjunctive ro(m)
    mo-x-vid-od-e(-t) 'if you (you(PU) were to come', the Aorist Indicative = m o - x -
    ved-i(-t) 'you (you Pl.) came', and the Aorist Subjunctive = ro(m) mo-x-vid-e(-t)
    'in order that you (you Pl.) may come'. ,
11. Changes to the root will be explained at the appropriate time.
12 The following examples come from lit'erat'uruli sakartvelo          'Literary Georgia' (3rd
    Feb 1989 page 11 and 1st June 1990 page 2 respectively): ra (Ø-)a-dard-eb- t

13 This h- used also to be found before - b , and it sometimes still occurs in this context.
    Volume 8 of KEGL, for instance, gives the entry-form é a - h - b a r - d - e b - a PREV-
    3rd.PER-be.entrusted-PASS-TS-X(FUT)          X will be entrused to Y'. The Dictionary of
    Morphemes and Modal Elements, published in 1988, also quotes such forms as da-h-
    bzu-i-s 'X buzzes over Y', whereas KEGL volume III, published in 1953, cites this
    latter verb without the h - .
14 These two zero-morphs represent respectively 2nd person subject and 3rd person
    direct object. I arbitrarily assume throughout this work that the affixal ordering is
    subject-direct object-indirect object.
15 The switch in preverb is dealt with below (4.3).
16 In Old Georgian plurals in -n- always imposed their plurality on the verb.
17 There is a homonymous Indirect Verb usually used in conjunction with a negative to
    mean 'have' (e.g. ara+per-i ar m-e-bad-eb-a            nothing-NOM not I-I OV-have-TS-
     it(FUT) 'I shall have nothing', which in the Present I ndicative would be m - a - b a d - i -
    a), but in the present instance we are dealing with the dynamic bipersonal passive of
    the root -bad- 'give birth'.
18 Masdars are usually construed with the relevant preverb.
19 Both variant-masdars (abstract-nouns) are employed by KEGL in the explanation
    offered of the entry-form i-rb-en-s 'X will run', namely: si-rb-il-it i-vl-i-s, r b -
    en-it c'a-va=c'a-mo-va 'X will move about running, X will go and come away
    running'.
20 The presence of a 1st or 2nd person direct object with a root that is construed with
    mi- does not of course occasion any such substitution (e.g. gvino t'k'b+il-ad mi-
    m-a-jin-eb-s 'wine will sweetly lull me to sleep').
5Ø8                              GEORGI AN GRAMMAR21    The natural order in English is of course here to have hither- followed by thither-
      orientation.
22    For the Dative in this quote from Vazha Pshavela cf. 5.1.1.5 (g).
23    The 3rd person subject-affix for this verb-form (sc. with any preverb) is actually zero
      as a result of the historical accident which saw the disappearance of material from
      the original end of the word, which was in Old Georgian da-val-s , where -s was the
      subject-suffix.
24    Note the plural verb-form though the subject is inanimate in this example from KEGL
25    Quoted by the Dictionary of Morphemes as da-h-mger-i-s .
26    The 1953 edition is not accessible to me.
27
      Forms such as (a-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an, (gada-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an, (ga-)(0-0-0-)a-
      t'an, (mo-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an (for which see the final paragraph of 4.4.4) are basically
      Locative Versional forms, for which see also 4.4.4. Note also the difference in the
      formation of the Perfect for the Subjective vs Locative Versional forms of this root
      (e.g. a-g-i-t'an-i-a 'you (have) apparently endured X/them' vs a-g-i-t'an-eb-i-a
      'you (have) apparently gone up and reached').
28    Cf. the Indo-European so-called Dative of Interest seen in this Latin example from
      Livy: militanti in Hispania pater eimoritur 'while he was serving [sc. Historic Present]
      in Spain, his father died', though, unlike Georgian, Latin verbs agree only with the
      subject argument.
29
      This is the Georgian translation (Danelia and Tsanava, 1991.47) of the Mingrelian
      osur-i giti-o-bs-әn-d- ә il ndem-c from one of the texts originally published by
      Q'ipshidze (1914).
30    KEGL does not quote the Subjective Versional form of this verb for the allomorph
      with an r root-finally.
31    N.B. (Ø-)g-i-sm-en-t 'I am listening to you (sc. to what you have to say)' with
      Objective Version, which is the standard opening gambit (a) when answering the
      phone or (b) for a waiter coming to take a customer's order.
32    The use of this verb with 'head' as direct object in the colloquial sense of 'cause
      shame to' necessitates the absence of versioniser (e.g. b i č - m a ojax-sa-c tav-i
      mo-(0-)s-č'r-a da čven-s sopel-sa-c             'the lad brought shame both to the family
      and to our village').
33    Note how this passive idea is conveyed by an active verb with non-referential 3rd
      person plural subject.
34    In verbs of this type the 'prescriptive' periphrasis that would change a 1st or 2nd
      person direct object into the 3rd person phrase 'my/our/your head' in the presence
      of a 3rd person indirect object tends to be ignored.
35
      There is also (mi-)(0-0-)i-p , at , iz'-eb .
36    Two Modern Georgian versions shew here the root - p ' q ' r - 'turn, direct' with
      Locative Version outranking the Subjective because of the (actual or implied)
      presence of an appropriate indirect object (viz. zeca-d ag-(0-?0-)a-p'q'r-o tval-
      n-i vs ca-s rni-(0-0-)a-p'q'r-o tval-eb-i).
37    Seen also in an ancient participle a+dg+il-i, now nominalised as 'place'.
38    Prescriptive grammar suggests that when the direct object is plural the root becomes
      -xoc-, as in (Ø-Ø-)xoc-av 'you kill them'.
39     In a number of compounds such as this the noun jvar-i does not syncopate (cf.
      me+jvar+e 'wedding-witness'), but when used in isolation it does syncopate (cf. the
      Genitive jvr-is ).
40    The element -n(i) here is the Mingrelian equivalent of the Georgian subordinator
      rom. If we transpose the Mingrelian system completely here into Georgian, an
       imperfective Conditional will be achieved simply by putting the auxiliary into its
      Conditional form (viz. i-kn-eb-od-a), whilst an imperfective Future Subjunctive will
      result if the auxiliary is placed in its Future Subjunctive form (viz. i-kn-eb-od-e-s).

43   Clearly the morphemic analysis of this verb-form is problematic: the Nominative case -
     marking of 'enemy' would suggest that the second zero-morph of the verb should
     carry the question-mark, but the fact that this Nominative nominal 'controls' the
     versioniser suggests that the first zero-morph is the one without an external noun.
44
     Under appropriate circumstances the preverb may change to mo-.
45
     Clearly the underlying form here is /ga-0-q'v-a/. Since the 3rd person singular of
     the copula in the Aorist has a similar underlying root-suffixal sequence, namely / i -
     q'v-a/, which in this book I write i-q'+o, for consistency I should perhaps also write
     ga-(0-)q'+o here.
46   At least this is the prescriptive rule, even if the occasional exception is found in
     texts.
47   Note this almost literal equivalent to the English method of giving dates, whereas the
     normal way today would be to say rva ianvar-s 8 January-DAT 'on the 8th
     January'.
48   In such combinations one of these labio-dentals may fail to be pronounced.
49
     Note that the radical labio-dental drops under the influence of this immediately
     following bilabial.
50   As explained in 5.2.2.1.7.4.3, a past temporal clause meaning 'before' is normally
     constructed with the Conditional (or Aorist). Is the presence here of the Pluperfect in
     the subordinate clause the result of the influence of the preceding Pluperfect or just
     a variant in the same way as English here allows both 'before you had VERBed' and
     'before you VERBed'?
51   Interestingly in the Mingrelian language, spoken in part of West Georgia, the
     Pluperfect of active voiced Transitive Verbs stands in the same relation to the
     Perfect as the Imperfect Indicative does to the Present Indicative, with the Objective
     Version generalised for marking the subject (e.g. do-m-(i-)č'ar(-u) = Georgian da-
     m-i-c'er-i-a 'I have written X/them' vs do-m-(i-)č'ar-u-d(-u)         = Georgian da-m-
     e-c'er-a 'I had written X/them').
52   Mingrelian has formalised this semantic distinction, at least as far as Series I
     screeves are concerned: i-č'ar-u 'X is being written' vs i-č'ar-e 'X can be written';
     m-a-č'ar-u 'X is being written for/on me' vs m-a-č'ar-e 'I can write X/them'.
53
     Interestingly Mingrelian uses the active voice (Transitive pattern) for both such
     verbs, viz. (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rz-en-k vs (Ø-Ø-)i-rz-en-k
54   This particular paradigm is a common Present Indicative for a number of verbs
     distinguished outside the Present Sub-Series by different preverbs. Perhaps the
     forms presented here are most often used in the sense of 'I remain/stay', which
     implies the use of the preverb da-.
55   Examples in KEGL suggest that, if the indirect object is inanimate, it may be
     expressed by means of the Objective Version.
56   This is the root-form of the Perfect as quoted by KEGL. However, in V. Topuria and
     Iv. Gigineishvili's 'Orthographic Dictionary' of 1968 the root-form ga-g-i-jg-i-a is
     given.
57   Do not confuse this with (ga-)i-njr-ev-i 'you (will) move', the Intransitive form of
     (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-njr-ev = (ga-XØ-Ø-)jr-av 'you (will) set X/them in motion'.
58   The Imperfect equivalent of sa-k'itx-i i-s-m-i-s 'a question is being posed' is sa-
     k'itx-i i-s-m-od-a.
59   The meaning 'come forth to meet' would result from a change of preverb to mo-.
60    KEGL wrongly gives this form as the impossible mo-i-xvn-a.
61   Note the devoicing of the back fricative in the first two persons.
62    For this one verb Tschenkéli (1958.I.271) reports a variant in - e .
510                                  GEORGI AN GRAMMAR
63    One meets the occasional example (and not infrequently in the works of Vazha
      Pshavela) where, in place of the regular expansion in -od- plus Imperfect Indicative
      or Prešent Subjunctive endings, the Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive of bipersonal
      Intransitives are formed after the pattern of monopersonal Intransitives, i.e. by the
      addition of the Aorist Indicative or Aorist Subjunctive respectively of the copula.
      For example, take the Indirect Verb (and Indirect Verbs are formally identical to
      bipersonal Intransitives in Series III) in romel-sa-c še+u+jl+eb+el-i-a e+s
      si+t'q'v-eb-i da-(Ø-)vic'q'-eb-i-q'+o 'who it is impossible to have forgotten these
      words' (instead of da-(Ø-)vic'q'-eb-od-a ); instead of ar m-a-xs+ov-s vin+me
      gverd-ze mo-m-jd-om-od-e-s                         'I don't recall anyone sitting down beside me' one
      may hear the III rd Subjunctive formed as m o - m - j d - o m - i - q ' - o - s . An example is
      even available of a monopersonal Perfect replacing the expected bipersonal form: it
      is from the now defunct Paris-basedGEORGIANjournal 'šentinel' (No. 29, 1992, p.6Ø):
      kart+ul-i p'resa a+m gir+s+še+sa+nišn+av mo+vl+en+a-s ar g a - m o -
      x m a + u r - e b - u l - a 'theGEORGIANpress has not responded to this significant
      phenomenon' (in place of the 'correct' ga-mo-(Ø-)xma+ur-eb-i-a ).
64    KEGl quotes an alternative ending, namely -ev-i(-t) , when the subject is 1st or 2nd
      person.
65    Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would respectively be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-v-
      i-v-a+r-t, da-(Ø-Ø-)xoc-v-i-x-a+r-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-v-i-an
66    Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-od-i-t, da-(Ø-
      Ø-)xoc-od-i-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-od-nen
67
      This phonetic form may also be interpreted as da-(Ø-Ø-)bad-eb-od-e-t                               'may
      you(Pl.) be born to X/them'.
68    This phonetic form may also mean 'may I/we be born to you(Pl.)' or 'may we be born
      to you'.
69    This phonetic form may also be interpreted as da-(Ø-Ø-)mal-od-e-t                         'may you(Pl.)
      hide from X/them'.
70    This form may also mean 'may I /we stick to you(Pl.)' or 'may we stick to you'.
71    Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-od-e-t,                      da-(Ø-
      Ø-)xoc-od-e-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-od-nen.
72    This is short for magalit-ad 'for example', and I simply give here a possible fIIIer
      just to offer a flavour of the construction.
73    Though this is 'regular' insofar as the form is bipersonal, since the Masdar is g a -
      xir-v-a , one would have expected this bipersonal form to be ga-g-xir-v-i-a,
      seemingly unattested according to both KEGl and Tschenkčli's dictionary.
74    N.B. Tschenkčli offers a choice for the participial base of such forms by prešenting a
      bracketed element, viz. ga-(Ø-)xir-(eb-)ul-x-a+r .
75
      E.g. ar-c c'in c'a-(?Ø-)e-čr-eb-a, ar-c uk'an ča-mo-dg-eb-a                             'X will neither
      push himself forward nor step back'.
76    As in this example: i+ma-s ver v-(Ø-)i-t'q'v-i, rom šuxart-i srul+i+ad ga-
      rk'v-e-ul-i-q'-o-s                  xan-is (resp.           haes) p'repiks-eb-ad         xmar+eb-is
      sa+k'itx-Si 'I shan't be able to say that Schuchardt gained a complete understanding
      of the question of the use as prefixes of xan (or hae)'.
77    As in: čv+e+ul+eba-d m-a-kv-s mo+u+mzad+eb+1-ad ar-sad c'a-v-(?Ø-)e-
      čxir-o 'I have the practice of not getting involved anywhere unprepared'.
78    An interesting example of the use of such a structurally unmotivated -eb to create a
      formal distinction in Series III not found elsewhere in the paradigms is seen in the
      case of š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e c ' - e b - i - x - a + r   'you apparently went in exile to place X and
      took refuge there', which has Prešent-Future (s'e-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xvec , -eb-i                     and Aorist
      ( š ) ( Ø - Ø - ) e - x v e c ' - e . These Series I and II forms are also used in the šense of
      'you (will) beseech X/them', which verb then has the Perfect š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e c ' + n - i - x -
      a+r; this is based on the Masdar ( š ) x v e c ' + n - a 'beseeching; taking refuge', which
      would be expected to underlie Series III for the latter of its šenses too. In the case
                                      VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                             511     of (áe-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xizn-eb-i 'you (will) take refuge in X' (Masdar še-xizvn-a) KEGL
     gives the Perfect as še-(Ø-Ø-)xizvn-i-x-a+r , and yet in the illustrations appended
     to the relevant entry we find an example of the Pluperfect from Tedo Razik'ashvili
     shewing the unmotivated -eb again, viz. bosl-eb-sa da sa+bj+1-eb-s še-(Ø-)
     x i z n - e b - o d - n e n 'they had taken refuge in the animal- and grain-barns'.
79   There can be no doubt about this: KEGL gives as one synonym for (da-)(Ø-)i-c'ok-
     eb-a the (transitive) verb-phrase muxl-s (mo-)(Ø-)i-q'r-i-s , where muxl-i = 'knee'
     and the verb means 'bend'. Thus, the example arčil-i giorg-is login-tan da-
     čok-il-i-q'+o 'Archil had knelt down at the bed of Giorgi' could be paraphrased as
     arčil-s...muxl-i mo-(Ø-)e-q'ar-a. In voluntary buckling of the knees is expressed
     by the bipersonal intransitive verb seen in: vin-me-s muxl-i (mo-)(Ø-)e-č'r-eb-
     a/Amo-)(Ø-)e-k'vet-eb-a, literally 'the knee is/will be cut//sliced for someone'.
80   For my review see Hewitt (1983a).
81   There are two types of exception: (i) Medials which have no Future Sub-Series but
     which would have employed this combination of affixes to form the non-existent
     screeves, had they existed, and (ii) a small number of irregular Medials which use
     only the prefix i- to form the Future Sub-Series.
82   Taking an example like the following from Literary Georgia (18 Nov 1988, p. 15): c ' a -
     val da šv+il-eb-sa-c da-v-(Ø-)xoc-av, tav-s ar v-(Ø-)i-cocxl-eb                          'I shall go
     and kill (my) children; I shall not allow myself to live', we assume tav-s v-(Ø-)i-
     cocxl-eb 'I shall allow myself to live' became v-(Ø-)i-cocxl-eb 'I shall be/remain
     alive'.
83   There are a number of examples where a Series 111 screeve of some Medial is
     presented (sc. other than in actual citations from literature) at different places in the
     8-volume KEGL, now with the nasal, now without it.
84   This is the ceremony when, during the lying-in-state at home in the days before the
     funeral, visitors come to pay their respects by ritualistic weeping over the corpse.
85   Some Medials in -av produce their Perfects like normal Transitive Verbs in -av (e.g.
     (Ø-)bobg-av = (Ø-)bordg-av = (Ø-)xox-av 'you crawl' have Perfects g - i - b o b g -
     a v - s = g-i-bordg-av-s = g-i-xox-av-s, and yet (Ø-)čoč-av 'you crawl' has the
     Perfect g-i-čoč-(?n-)-a!
86   Cf. the synonyms based on cognate forms: varaud-ad a+r-i-s 'it is as a supposition'
     or s a - v a r a u d - o - a 'it is a matter for supposition'.
87   Cf. the synonym based on a cognate form: sa-grjn-ob-i-a 'it is perceptible'.
88   Cf. the synonyms based on cognate forms: na-gul+is+xm-ev-i-a 'it is meant' or s a -
     gul+is+xm-eb-el-i-a 'it is to be meant'.
89   Wherever this o-vowel is absent in the paradigm, the labio-dental is restored, as in
     the Future (?Ø-)i-gor-av-eb-s 'X will roll around'.
90   This sort of verb, discussed under 2.5 with reference to sound-symbolism, is a typical
     member of the Medial class.
91   There is also (?Ø-)a-c'vim-eb-s 'X brings (will bring) rain' (e.g. k a r - i guria-ši
     xšir-ad (?Ø-)a-c'vim-eb-s 'the wind often brings rain to Guria').
92   With Objective Version we have ši+mš+il-it gul-i m-i-c'ux-s 'my heart is heavy
     through hunger', or, from the inceptive, kal-s gul-i (Ø-)u-c'ux-d-eb-od-a                        'the
     woman's heart was turning sad'.
93   For both m o - c u r - a v - s and m i - c u r - a v - s there is a full set of paradigms, so that
     the meanings respectively are 'X swims (will swim) over here' and 'X swims (will swim)
     over there' (=> Aorist m o - / m i - c u r - a => Perfect mo-/mi-(Ø-)u-cur-av-s ).
94   Note a cognate synonym formed as a bipersonal (but monovalent) Intransitive Verb,
     viz. da-(?Ø-)e-xet'-eb-a.
95   Only the form with indirect object is quoted by KEGL when the preverb is da-.
96   Note the shift of Thematic Suffix from -ob without indirect object to -eb here. The
     verb may be used as in the expression av+ad+m+q'+op-is t'uč-eb-s gim+il-i da-
512                                      GEORGI AN GRAMMAR      s-tamaS-eb-d-a = ga-mo-h-k'rt-od-a 'a smile was playing around the lips of the
      sick person'.
97 Note that the preverb here is not in the Prešent Sub-Series.
98 Such formations are not limited to Medials. Consider: c ' a - ( Ø - Ø - ) i - č ' 'you will
      have a bite of something to eat'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-loc-av 'you will say a little prayer';
      c'a-i-t'rus-eb-a 'X will get a bit scorched'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-)in-eb 'vou will snatch a
      bit of sleep'; c'a-i-nam-eb-a 'X will get a bit wet with dew'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-xems-
      eb = š ( Ø - ) n a q ' r - d - e b - i 'you will snatch a bite of food'.
99 Cf. the unmarked Intransitive Verb (da-)prtx-eb-i 'you (will) take fright' <= (da-)(Ø-
      Ø-)a-prtx-ob 'you (will) alarm X/them' or, with ga- as an alternative preverb, 'you
      (will) frighten and put to flight'. With this compare (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-prtx+il-eb 'you
      (will) warn X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)u-prtx+il-d-eb-i 'you (will) be wary of X/them'
      or 'you (will) treat X/them with care'.
100 E.g. delegat'-eb-i si+am+ovn+eb-it (Ø-)p'asux-ob-en q'ovel+gvar t'q'u+il-
      sa da mo+čven+eb+it še+k'itx+v-eb-s 'the delegates provide answers with
      pleasure to every kind of lie and specious question'.
101 Also the indirect object may be the possessor of the subject (e.g. luarsab-s saxe
      mudam (Ø-)u-cin-od-a 'luarsab's face was always laughing').
102 Cf. bed-i g-i-gim-i-s 'fate smiles on you' (vs bed-i (?Ø-)g-i-muxtl-eb-s 'fate lets
      (will let) you down').
103 Cf. (mo-/mi-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-c , od-eb                 -tan 'you (will) issue a call/summons to X/them
       to Y', not to be confused with (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'od-eb                  'you (will) hand X/them
       to Y/them', produced by back-formation from the Aorist mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'od-e
       which originally had the (stIII extant) Prešent-Future (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'vd-i
       with the Intransitive (Ø-)s-c'vd-eb-l 'you reach out and attain/touch X/them'; any
      appropriate preverb is used (as indeed for the corresponding Transitive) to produce
       the perfective screeves (e.g. Future m o - / m i - / a - 7 g a - / ( 5 a - ( Ø - ) s - c , v d - e b - i =>
       Aorist mo-/mi-/a-/ga-/ča-(Ø-)s-c'vd-i                  => Perfect m o - / m i - / a - / g a - / š a - ( Ø - ) s -
       c'vd-om-i-x-a+r).
1Ø4 Note that there is no preverbless Prešent to this Future, for (Ø-Ø)a-)ax-eb is the
       (pseudo-)Causative 'you (will) make X/them shout' (Perfect g-i-)ax-eb-i-a ).
1° 5 For mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)ax-eb cf. Transitive (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xl-i 'you (will)
      bring X/them crashing against Y/them; you (will) shoot X/them at Y/them; you (will)
      hurl verbal X at Y/them'.
1Ø6 NO form with mo- is quoted.
1Ø7 Note the prešence of the Thematic Suffix -eb, which means that this is not simply
       the basic Medial plus preverb.
1Ø8 This example using either of the transitive synonyms would inGEORGIANbe: (i)
       Prešent-Future pot-a-mde or dge-s (mo-)v-(Ø-Ø-)a-nd+om-eb                                         = (še-)v-
       (Ø-Ø-)a-l-ev        si+a+r+ul-s, (ii) Aorist pot-a-mde or-i dge mo-v-(Ø-Ø-)a-
       nd+om-e = še-v-(Ø-Ø-)a-l-i-e si+a+r+ul-s , (iii) Perfect pot-a-mde or-i dge
       mo-m-i-nd+om-eb-1-a = še-m-i-1-ev-i-a si+a+r+ul-is-tvis
 109 Presumably a second Dative (such as game-s 'night' or p'eriod-s 'period') is
       understood.
 110. E.g. č'+a k+on-eb-a-ze h-k'id-i-a 'eating hangs on having' = 'how one eats
       depends on what one has'.
 111 For which c'ign-s da-v-(Ø-)a-t'ar-eb serves as a Transitive alternative in either
       the prešent or the future.
 112
     One of the two labio-dentals in such collocations may be omitted.
 113 For which malmun-s da-v-(Ø-)a-t'ar-eb serves as a Transitive alternative in
       either the prešent or the future.
 114 The archaic mo-m-e-sm-i-s (etc..) is also sometimes stIII found.
 115 For the preverbal form KEGl quotes the Perfect as mo-m-sm-i-a.
                                         VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                                513
116 The only example given by KEGl has the recipient of the information governed by
    the postposition - t a n . However, the preradical - a - is surely the locative Version in
    origin, and if we note that with preverb š                    this same meaning is possible and that
    the recipient may stand in the Dative as indirect object (e.g. me+p+e vaxt'ang ...
    q'een-s š ( Ø - Ø - ) a - s m - i n - e s   'they informed on King Vaxt'ang to the khan'), it is
    likely that the Dative too will be possible with preverb da-.
117 In the šense of 'accept a proposal/plea', in which case it is synonymous with (še-)(Ø-
    Ø-)i-c'q'nar-eb.
118 Sometimes found without preverb even in the normally perfective screeves.
119
    The antonym is (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c'un-eb.
120 Not to be confused with (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c'q'-eb 'you (will) begin X/them'.
121 N.B. such Prešent Sub-Series only formations as c ' a - ( ? Ø - ) i - b o r š č - e b - s 'it
    resembles borshch', c ' a - ( ? Ø - ) i - m e + c n + i e r - e b - s 'X makes himself out to be a
    scholar/scientist'.
122 Cf. from sa+c'q'+al-i 'wretched' we get the similarly formed tav-s (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-
    sa+c'q'+l-eb 'you (will) make yourself out to be wretched', and from m-k'vd-ar-i
    'dead' we have tav-s (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-m+k'vd+ar-un-eb 'you                             (will) pretend to be
    dead'.
123 Also for this šense in the Prešent Sub-Series only we have g-i-mjim-s (from mjime
    'heavy'), as in mo+x+u+c-s suntk+v+a (Ø-)u-mjim-d-a = (Ø-)u-č'ir-d-a 'the old
    man found breathing difficult'.
124 Cf. the figurative expression k'ač'k'ač'-s ga-(?Ø-Ø-)a-civ-a da ga-(?Ø-Ø-)a-
    cx+el-a äiä-isa-gan 'the magpie got a cold and hot fever from fear'. 'Fever' =
    c i + e b - c x + e l + e b a , where the root -ci(v)- indicates 'cold'. We have a similar type
    of construction for the expression ' X D A T comes out in a rash', as seen in the
    following example, where only the agent of the verb remains unstated: bavšv-s mtel
    t'an-ze m u c ' u k ' - e b - i ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-q'ar-?a                 'the child came out in spots all
    over his body'.
125
    Holisky (1981.129) quotes (?Ø-)e-civ-eb-a, but this is not given by                      KEGl
126 As an ailment 'cold' is surdo (e.g. surdo m-a-kv-s 'I have a cold') vs grip'-i 'flu'.
127 The older form of the root was - t ' p - and it is assumed to be a borrowing from the
    Indo-European root that gives us 'tepid'. TheGEORGIANcapital, Tbilisi, literally means
    '(the place) of something warm', usually taken to refer to the hot natural springs of
    the area. The older form of the root gave rise, through Persian, to the former
    English designation of Tiflis.
128 On the same principle one has gril-a 'it is cool' => Future si+gril+e i-kn-eb-a or
    (?Ø-)e-gril-eb-a, which latter may also function with a true indirect object as a
    synonym for (Ø-)u-gril-d-eb-a 'X becomes cool for Y' => Imperfect gril-od-a 'it
    was cool' (cf. s i - g r i l - e 'coolness', g r i l - i 'cool'), without being able to form an
    Indirect Verb from it, as well as bnel-a 'it is dark' (cf. s i - b n e l - e 'darkness', b n e l - i
    'dark') => Future (?Ø-)e-bnel-eb-a or si+bnel+e i-kn-eb-a.
129
    Holisky (1981.129) but not KEGl quotes (?Ø-)e-tb+il-eb-a for the Future.
130 Or should we analyse g-e-t'k'-in-eb-a?
131 In the Future a - g - t V i v - a is also possible.
132 -tvin is an older form of -tvis 'for'.
133 Between vowels the -v- is optional.
134 It would appear that the origin of the sequence -ši(v)- lies in the Aorist of this
    earlier form (viz. mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-m+š-i-e 'you made X/them hungry').
135 Sometimes the preradical - e - is (incorrectly) altered to -i-.
136 Cf. (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)e-vač'r-eb-i 'you haggle with X/them over the price of Y' => Aorist
     (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)e-vač'r-e => Perfect                  še-rø-?Ø-Ø-)vač'r-eb-i-x-a+r           (e.g. ert u r e m - s
     (?Ø-)g-e-vač'r-eb-i 'I am bargaining with you over the price of one wagon').

137 In the šense of 'stretch out to get hold of X/them' this verb-form is bipersonal in
     Series III with the Perfect da-(Ø-)šur-eb-i-a i+s ma-s             'X has stretched out to
     grab Y'.
138 KEGl quotes mo-(Ø-Ø-)u-čkar-eb-s pex-s                  as equivalent to a-(Ø-Ø-)u-škar-
     eb-s pex-s, but in the one example quoted (from Vazha Pshavela) we see the noun
     for 'foot' standing in the Nominative (not the Dative) with an Aorist verb-form (viz.
     mo-(Ø-?Ø-)u-čkar-es        m+dev+r-eb-ma-c pex-i             'the pursuers too increased
     their pace'). Cf. nabij-s/si+a+r+ul-s mo-v-(?Ø-Ø-)u-mat'-o-t 'let's increase             our
     pace/walking', and ma+t'ar+eb+el-ma             (?Ø-Ø-)u-mat'-a/(?Ø-Ø-)u-k'l-o    svl+a-s
     'the train increased/decreased its speed (lit. movement)'.
139
     Or should it be g-c'q'+in-s?
140 As a non-Indirect Verb we can have (Ø-)s-jer-x-a+r as a synonym for (Ø-)s-jer-
     d-eb-i 'you are satisfied with X D A T ' .
141 There is a gap here in the Indirect paradigm which is fIIIed by the Medial formation
     from (Ø-Ø-li-c'am-eb 'you will judge X/them credible' => Perfect g-i-c'am-eb-i-a.
142
     E.g. m+mart+v+el+ob-ts si+sul+el-it xalx-i sa+č'm+l-is na+k'1+eb+oba-s
     gan-(Ø-)i-cd-i-s 'through the folly of the government the people are suffering a
     shortage of food'.
143 For which g-e-mjim-eb-a/g-e-mjim-a                 'you deem/deemed X/them heavy' is a
     virtual synonym vs g-e-mčat'-eb-a/g-e-mčat'-a 'you deem/deemed X/them light'.
144 ALL Transitive Verbs (other than those in -av and -am) end in this same sequence in
     the Perfect when their direct object is 3rd person. In OldGEORGIANboth Statives and
     all Transitive Verbs (other than those in -av and -am) in the Perfect ended in the
     sequence -ie-s . This parallelism leads to the hypothesis that in origin today's Perfect
     of Transitive Verbs was a Stative-Resultative formation that was fundamentally
     intransitive with a Nominative subject and Dative indirect object of the interested
     party (indicated by means of the Objective Version). A reinterpretation took place of
     the roles of these two arguments (leading to the Dative becoming the subject and the
     Nominative becoming the direct object) as the hypothesised Resultative was
     assimilated as the modern-day Perfect screeve within the new three-Series verbal
     system as it affected Transitive (and Medial) Verbs.
145 Vogt (1971.158) gives an example in Objective Version with two Datives (viz. ra-c me
     (?Ø-)m-i-k'id-i-a aklem-eb-s, met'-i ar m-i-nd-a               'I want no more than what I
     have suspended on the camels').
146 Out of context such Future Sub-Series and Series II screeves are ambiguous
     between the Stative šense being discussed here and the Dynamic šense, which would
     be 'X is being hung up for Y' for (Ø-)e-k'id-eb-a, whose Future would now be da-
     (Ø-)e-k'id-eb-a vs the Aorist da-(Ø-)e-k'id-a vs the Perfect da-h-k'id-eb-i-a
147 Vogt (1971.157) not only quotes the Objective Versional pul-i (Ø-)u-bar-i-a bank'-
     ši 'X has money deposited at the bank' but also (p. 166) an MP bar-eb-ul-a, neither
     of which appears in KEGl.
148 Vogt has the Objective Versional maril-i (Ø-)u-bn-ev-i-a               'X has salt scattered
     about', which is abšent from KEGl.
149 This is the form given by KEGl, but Shanidze offers h-bj-in-eb-i-a .
150 Also used in the same šense is h - g o n - e b - s ' X N O M thinks Y' (e.g. v-(Ø-)gon-eb
      tav-s p'irvel k'ac-ad 'I suppose myself to be top man').
151 Or is it d+ev-s/j+ev-s?
152 Vogt offers the variant (Ø-)u-dv-i-a .
153 E.g. xalx-ši v-(Ø-)u-r-ev-i-v-a+r           'I am involved with the people' => Perfect v-r-
      e-ul-v-a+r.
154 E.g. for the Perfect bze-s p'ur-is marcval-i (Ø-)r-ev-i-a               'the chaff apparently
     had wheat-grain mixed up in it'.

    Sometimes the Prešent of this verb in particular takes an extra element -n word-
    finally. The full form of the root is -rkv- (cf. tv+it+ma+rkv+i+a 'self-styled').
156 Vogt gives an example with two Dative: imed-i gul-sa (?Ø-)m-p-en-i-a                   'hope is
    cast over my heart'.
157 Is the sequence -q'en- an amalgamation of the copular root - q ' - plus an old
    Causative - e n - ? If someone is already on their feet and you make them stand
    somewhere, this verb is used; if you help someone to their feet, then the preverb a-
    is necessary; for 'cocking a gun' the preverb is š , just as it is for the meaning 'halt'.
158 This form with initial s- is normally used in the šense given. However KEGl gives
    c'er-i-a as the monovalent form, suggesting that when initial s- is prešent the
    meaning is 'be written for X', though the only example quoted for this is the
    colloquialism a+ka+ur+oba-s jvar-i s-c'er-i-a/(ø-)e-c'er-o-sl 'Touch wood!'.
159 Cf. (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-c'q'-ob 'you (will) arrange (e.g. meeting)', (a-XØ-Ø-)a-c'q'-ob
    'you (will) arrange things on or in somewhere', (ča-XØ-Ø-la-c'q'-ob 'you (will)
    arrange things down inside something/get things sorted out by sly means (e.g.
    bribery)'; cf. ra ga-v-(Ø-)a-c'q'-o? 'what can I be expected to do about it?', ra
    ga-(Ø-)e-c'q'-ob-a? 'what is there for it/what's to be done?', xval tu ar g-a-
    c'q'-ob-s, zeg š v - ( Ø - ) x v d - e - t (ert+man+et-s) 'if tomorrow is no          good for
    you, let's meet (each other) the day after tomorrow'.
160 Note the extra element -eb-. Cf. (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xil-(v-)eb 'you (will) shew X/them to
    Y/them', though tval-s (Ø-Ø-)a-xil-eb may be used like tval-s (Ø-Ø-)a-xel 'you
    open your eyes'; note also from xil-i 'fruit' the verb (Ø-Ø-Ø-)xil-eb 'you (will) give
    X/them the first taste of some fruit Y' (e.g. st'umr-eb-s q'urjen-i v-(Ø-Ø-)a-xil-
    o-t 'let's give the guests their first taste of grapes'.
161 E.g. nene-m š ( Ø - Ø - ) a - v e d r - a gvt+a+eba-s tav+is-i p'ir+m+š+o                  'Nene
    besought the godhead for protection for her first-born'. A synonym for (še-)(Ø-)e-
     vedr-eb-a is ( i e - X Ø - ) e - x v e c ' - e b - a , from which we have the monopersonal
    derivative in the Prešent Sub-Series only i-xvec'-eb-a 'X is urging, pleading' and
     the parallel Causative (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'-eb 'you (will) ask seek protection for
    X/them DO from Y/them IO'. However, preverbless (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'-eb                      may be
     used in Imeretian like either (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'+n-in-eb              or the strange (Ø-Ø-Ø-)i-
     xvec'+i-eb in the meaning 'you (will) get X/them to beseech Y/them (to do Z)//to ask
     for Y/them (from Z/them)'. Not to be confused with (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'-in-eb
     'you (will) get X/them to polish/refine Y/them' <= Prešent-Future (da-XØ-Ø-)xvec'.
162 In OldGEORGIAN- e v - also functioned as a possible Causative exponent, and a few
     verbs are stIII used with this suffix.
163 Not to be confused with (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-}a-)l-eb-in-eb                  'you empower X/them to
     survive//enable X/them to put up with Y/them' from (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-)jl-eb 'you (will)
     survive/stay' or (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)l-eb 'you (will) put up with X/them' (e.g.
     žang+bad-i          (?Ø-Ø-)a-)l-eb-in-eb-s              m+pr+in+av-s aero+st'at'-it did
     si+magl+e-ze a+pr+en-isa-s 'oxygen allows a pilot to survive when flying at
     great height by balloon').
164 This Causative could also correspond to (ča-XØ-Ø-Ø-)a-cv-am                      'you (will) put
     X/them on Y/them' (Perfect ča-g-i-c-m-ev-i-a -tvis), in which                case the original
     indirect object would appear as postpositional object of - t v i s , e.g. deda mama-s
     p'alt'o-s (ša-)(Ø-Ø-)a-c-m-ev+in-eb-s bavSv-is-tvis                   , which in Series III
     produces a second postpositional phrase with - t v i s , viz. deda-s mam-is-tvis
     p'alt'o ča-(Ø-)u-c-m-ev+in-eb-i-a bavSv-is-tvis
165
     The Conditional is (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avl-i-d-i.
166
     The Imperfect/Conditional is (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sc'avl-i-d-i.
167 Cf. the phrase da+xmar+eb+a-s (ga-XØ-Ø-Ø-)u-c'-ev                          'you (will) render

171 Note that the incorporated noun in taq'van-is-m-cem-el-i 'worshipper' is in the

    suffixal vowels - e - and -a- respectively.
172 Though this is one of the Root Verbs which does alter the root in the Intransitive
    (e.g. (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)cvet 'you wear out X/them' vs (ga-)cvd-eb-a 'X wears out'), this
    Masdar may do service for both Transitive and Intransitive forms, even though a
    specifically Intransitive (ga-)cvd-om-a also exists.

      xmar(-eb) 'you (will) use X/them to help Y/them'). Not to be confused with d a - /
      mo-/mi-xmar-eb-a 'help(ing)' from (da-/mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xmar-eb-i.
217   This is 'sleeping' vs m-)in-ar-a 'with a penchant for sleeping'.
218   cf. ga-mo-)in-eb-ul-i 'wide awake (lit. slept out)'.
219   Formally from (š)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'var-eb 'you (will) get X/them to love Y/them' or
      (š)(Ø-Ø-)i-q'var-eb 'you (will) conceive a love for X/them'.
220   From the OldGEORGIANform, a+r-s, comes the derived noun a+r+s-i meaning either
      'living creature' (cf. the synonyms a+r+s+eba or sul+dg+m+ul-i) or 'esšence' (cf.
      ra+oba). The OldGEORGIANform also provides the basis for the verbs (da-)(Ø-
      Ø-)a-a+r+s-eb 'you (will) found X/them', (Ø-)a+r+s+eb-ob ( (Ø-)i-a+r+s+eb-eb)
      'you (will) exist' => a+r+s+eb-ob-a 'existence'.
221   Note the expected Mingrelian correlate in the corresponding Prešent Indicative: v-
      o+r-e-k, (Ø-)(o+)r-e-k, (o+)r-e(-n), v-o+r-e-t, (Ø-)(o+)r-e-t, (o+)r-e-n-
      a(n). Mingrelian has a full Prešent Sub-Series for its copula, but the forms that are
      cognate with GEORGI AN's u n d Series paradigms have the meaning 'become' in
      Mingrelian.
222   Note this construction with net'av plus Aorist Indicative with unexpressed 3rd
      person subject for a wish that is esšentially unrealisable.
223    Changing the preverb alters the meaning accordingly (e.g. a-svl-a 'going up', š e -
      mo-svl-a 'coming in').
224   In effect the 3rd person subject-affix here in the modern form is a zero-suffix.
225    When coupled with the preverb c'a-mo- , as in c'a-mo-di(-t) 'Come on along!', the
      preverb alone is often used in Imperative function (viz. c'a-mo!).
226   Cf. m+q'+op+ad-i 'Future Indicative'.
227   For the preverbless form (GEN = sa-val-isa ) cf. mirian-s jnel-sa-val t'q'e-ši
      gza da-(Ø-)e-bn-a 'Mirian lost his way in a difficult-to-negotiate forest'. It may be
      substantivised as in a+k-e+dan ert-i saat-is sa-val-i-a 'from here it is a one
      hour journey'.
228   Cf. še-mo-sa-val-i (GEN = š e - m o - s a - v l - i s a ) 'income, revenue'. As Future
      Participles 'for entry' we have both ša-sa-svl-el-i and š s a - v a l - i (GEN = š s a -
       vl-isa), though the former is used as the noun 'entrance, way in' — cf. ga-sa-val-i
       (GEN = ga-sa-vl-isa 'exit'), the latter as the noun 'introduction (e.g. to a book)'. N.B.
       the nominal use of g a d a - s a - s v l - e l - i 'crossing-point', as in                  mic'+is+kve+š+a
       gada-sa-svl-el-i 'underground-crossing, underpass'; the nominal use of ga-mo-sa-
       val-i with syncopating -a- is 'escape, way out (of problem)'; the nominal use of tav-
       gada-sa-val-i with syncopating -a- is 'series of adventures in life, biography'.
229    The morpheme-division here assumes that -ul- is the participial formant, whereas
       one could also analyse the word as mo-sul-i with - s u l - a variant of the root - s v l -
       seen in the Masdar.
230    Note the ordering of the agreement-affixes here: the Objective Versional complex
       precedes the intransitive subject marker!
231    Even though their III rd Series are formally identical, do not confuse this verb with
       Future ga-(Ø-)i-vl-eb-s, Aorist ga-(Ø-)i-vl-o, Perfect ga-(Ø-)u-vl-i-a (ra+me-
       ze, as in xanjal-ze xel-i g a - r ø - ) i - v l - o / m o - ( Ø - ) i - v l - o / c ' a - ( Ø - ) i - v l - o   'X
       snatched hold of his dagger'. Note the formally bivalent intransitive form of this verb
       with m o - in the handy expression mag sa+km+e-s mo-(Ø-)e-vl-eb-a, da-(Ø-)
       m š v i d - d - i ! 'that matter will get sorted out, calm down!', where there is no
       Nominative subject external to the verb. This form can also be used (i) in the šense of
       'land on top of' (viz. mt'red-i tav-ze mo-(Ø-)e-vl-o bič'-s                           'the pigeon landed on
       the lad's head') and (ii) as a parallel to the form with preverb š e - m o - in the
                                       VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                           519    expression for 'encircle' (viz. jar-i rk'al-i-vit (gar+s) ( š ) m o - g v - e - v l - o         š
    mo-gv-e-rt'q'-a 'the army surrounded us like a circle'). The expression tav-
    s/tav-ze š e - m o - g - e - v l - e is used as an expression of affection, especially by a
    parent or elder to a child, from the traditional belief that moving round a troubled
    person takes that person's suffering away: cf. g - e - n a + c v + a l - e 'darling' (lit. 'I
    changed places with you') or šen-i č'ir-i me [gad-mo-m-i-vid-e-sj                     'darling' (lit.
    'your woe upon me [may it come overj').
232
    The Aorist is Weak: gan-v-(Ø-)vl-e(-t), gan-(Ø-Ø-)vl-e(-t), gan-(Ø-)vl-es.
233 Also possible (with 3rd person Nominative subject) is (Ø-)e-jd-om-eb-a, though this
    form (along with the variant (Ø-)e-)d-om-il-eb-a ) is perhaps more frequent as an
    Indirect Verb, used in the Prešent Sub-Series only, in the šense of 'X has a hankering
    to sit down' (e.g. ra m-e-jd-om-(il-)eb-a, kal-o, xom bevr-i sa+km+e m-a-
    kv-s? 'why should I want to sit down, woman, I have a lot of things to do, don't I ?').
234 Also used substantivally in the šense of 'bottom'.
235 less common in da-sa-jd-om-el-i (with syncopating - e - ).
236 In speech (Ø-)u-dg-a is possible.
237 The Prešent Sub-Series Indirect Verb meaning 'X is able to stand' (usually negated) is
    (Ø-)e-dg-om-eb-a or ( Ø - ) e - d g - o m - i l - e b - a   or   (Ø-)e-dg-om-in-eb-a (e.g.
    p'art'izan-ta rig-eb-ši               ar (Ø-)e-dg-om-eb-od-a          'X was not able to
    stand/remain in the ranks of the partisans').
238 The I I I r d Series may also be based on the preverbless Masdar of (da-)(Ø-Ø-)dg-
    am 'you put X/them in a standing position', namely dg-m-a , to give v-(Ø-)dg-m-i-
    v-a+r, v-(Ø-)dg-m-od-i, v-(Ø-)dg-m-od-e etc...
239 An indirect object may be added without any versioniser (e.g. sp'ilo mt'er-s pex-
    eb-it š s - d g - e b - a da sul da-(Ø-)č'q'let'-s        'an elephant will stand on its enemy
     with its feet and completely squash it').
240 Is the root -c'ev- or should it rather be -c'+ev- ?
241 unlike the equivalent Stative roots 'be seated' and 'be standing' KEGl quotes no
    parallel Indirect Verb for this root with such a šense as 'X can/wants to be lying'.
242 Note that pursuit of some activity without any reference within the verb to a
    recipient requires the use in the Prešent Sub-Series of the bivalent Intransitive form
    of this root (e.g. xalx-i gan+ma+tav+is+up+1+eb+el om-s (Ø-)e-c'-ev-a
     imp'erializm-is c'ina+ag+m+deg 'the people are engaged in a war of liberation
    against imperialism'), and yet outside the Prešent Sub-Series Transitive forms are
    employed (viz. agit'acia-s ga-(Ø-)s-c'-ev-s//agit'acia ga-(Ø-)s-c'-i-a                         a+m
    k'andidat'-is sa+sa+rg+eb+1+o-d 'X will//did engage in agitation in favour of this
    candidate').
243 This is also used as a substantive equivalent to login-i 'bed' = sa+jil+e.
244 Is the root -dev-/-)ev- or should it be -d+ev-/-)+ev-?
245 Not to be confused with s-d-ev-s (Aorist s-d-i-a , with no Series III) 'X follows
     after Y/them'.
246 Cf. ga-mo-m-c-em-el-i with syncopating vowel 'publisher',               ga-mo-m-c-em-1-oba
     'publishing house'.
247 If this is 'knowing' in the šense of wisšen, savoir, (ga-XØ-Ø-)i-cn-ob 'you (will)
     know (person(s))' is used in the šense of kennen, connaître.
248 Cf. the derived noun uc'q'+i+s-i 'official list of names', and the verbs sa+oc+ar
     ambav-s (Ø-)gv-a-uc'q'-eb-en 'they are informing/will                 inform us of surprising
     news', k'oresp'ondent'-i (Ø-)i-uc'q'-eb-a, rom...                'the correspondent reports
     that...', inglis-is m+k'itx+v+el sa+zog+ad+o+eba-s (Ø-)e-uc'q'-a rom... 'it was
     reported to the English reading public that...', for which last verb-form no Series III
     exists.
249 N.B. the derived adjective u-v+i+c-i 'ignorant', which gives the abstract noun u-
     v+i+c-oba 'ignorance'. Cf. u-c+od+in-ar-i 'ignorant, uneducated' => u-c+od+in-
     ar-oba 'ignorance'.
52Ø                                 GEORGI AN GRAMMAR250 Do not confuse this verb with the Indirect Verb (še-)g-e-cod-eb-i 'you (will) pity
    me'.
251 From vin (Ø-)i-c-i-s?            'Who knows?' is derived the complex conjunction
    vin+i+c+oba+a 'if perchance, in case'.
252 N.B. da-tk-m-ul dro-s 'at the appointed time', š t k - m - u l - e b a 'plot', gada-tk-m-
    a 'gainsaying, renouncing'.
253 Note the semantic difference between such pairs as: a-rč-e-ul(-i) i-kn-a vs a-rč-
    e-ul-i i-q'+o : the former is dynamic 'X was elected (e.g. in the election)' vs the
     latter which is the stative 'X was (in a state of having been) elected'. However, in an
     article in literary Georgia (1 June 199Ø, p.5) by Zurab Sardzhveladze we see that in
     speaking on two occasions of one and the same event (viz. the invention of the Greek
     alphabet) he employs in the first instance the copula plus Past Participle, whilst in the
     second he utilises the dynamic passive of the same verb, which in this case is of the
     synthetic type.         The first example is: sa+varaud+o-a,                   rom berjn+ul-i
     da+m+c'er+1+oba p'ir+v+el-i at+as+c*l+eul-is mi+jn+a-ze i-q'-o-s                             škmn-
     il-i 'it is to be supposed that Greek writing was created on the threshold of the first
     mIIIennium [sc. B.C.j' vs (Ø-)varaud-ob-en, rom e+s                         tav+da+p'ir+v+el-i
     berjn + ul-i        an+ban-i         u+nd+a š e - k m n - i l - i - q ' + o e r t + o b + l + i v - i
     Se+mo+km+ed+eb-is Je+deg+ad 'they suppose that this proto-type Greek
     alphabet must have been created as the result of joint creativity'.
254 This is rather reminiscent of the construction with ga-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-šv-i kal-i                      'you
     let the womanNOM go'-
255 This word is also used in the šense of m+xed+v+el+oba 'sight' (cf. also the phrase
     m+xed+v+el+oba-ši mi-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-eb                 'you         will       take      X/them       into
     view/consideration'). Cf. also xed-i 'sight = what is in vision, view', for which
     sa+nax+a+oba is also used, though this latter may also mean 'something worth
     seeing'.
256 This verb-form may also mean 'get better (in health)' (e.g. av+ad+m+q'+op-ma m o -
     (?Ø-)i-xed-a = mo-(?Ø-)i-k*et-a = av+ad+m+q'+op-i u+k'et ga-xd-a 'the sick
     person got better').
257 Also possible are i-nax-v-eb-a and the older pattern i-nax-v-i-s
258 N.B. (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)i-xil-av 'you (will) examine your own X(s)', which contrasts with the
     specific meaning attaching to the older form of this preverb seen in (gan-)(Ø-Ø-)i-
     xil-av 'you (will) examine/discuss X/them'.
259 As a noun q'ur-i = 'ear'.
260 When used with this i-suffix, as it more usually is, the Imperfect is formed by -od- .
261
     Cf. (mi-)(Ø-Ø-)a-čer-d-eb-i         = (mi-)(Ø-Ø-)a-šter-d-eb-i              (Aorist mi-(Ø-Ø-)a-
     čer-d-i = mi-(Ø-Ø-)a-št'er-d-i , Perfect mi-(Ø-)s-čer-eb-i-x-a+r                          = mi-(Ø-
     Ø-)št'er-eb-i-x-a+r ). Cf. the formal Perfect š ( Ø - ) s - č e r - e b - i - x - a + r , which is
     used only as a Prešent Indicative in the meaning 'you stare fixedly at X/them' (with
     the formal Pluperfect še-(Ø-)s-čer-eb-od-i and III rd Subjunctive                    še-(Ø-)s-čer-
     eb-od-e being used as Imperfect Indicative and Prešent Subjunctive respectively.
262 Mingrelian has a Thematic Suffix -an- (e.g. r - t i r - a n - s 'X changes you').
263 The animate root is used when the object is a car, when used as a synonym for the
     verb in (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c'-ev mo+sa+val-s           'you (will) gather in the harvest', and
     when the object is 'example' (e.g. še+sa+per-i(s-i) magalit-i mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van-e
     'you adduced an apposite example').
264 Note how the expression 'who among you' is formed, namely by associating the
      interrogative pronoun with a 2nd person form of the verb. For a verb close in
     meaning to the one IIIustrated cf. (da-)(Ø-Ø-)e-bgauč'-eb-i                 'you (will) cling onto
     X/them' (e.g. bavšv-i ded-is k'alta-s            (Ø-)e-bgauč'-eb-od-a                'the child was
      clinging onto its mother's hem').
265 Cf. (da-)(Ø-)s-jer-d-eb-i ra-s-me           = (da-)(Ø-)k'ma+q'+op+il-d-eb-i r-iti-me
      'you are (will be) satisfied with something'.

    One would perhaps prescriptively have expected the last clause to read še-(Ø-)g-a-
    xved+r-a ¿em-i tav-i with the 1st person direct object transformed into the 3rd
    person periphrasis, allowing the (2nd) person marker remaining in the verb to
    correlate with the indirect object, but perhaps Vazha Pshavela here prefers the 1st
    person affix in the verb to keep the focus of attention on the 1st person direct
    object, who is the beneficiary of this chance-meeting. In place of a Dative indirect
    object with this verb one may also find the relevant nominal being governed by the
    postposition -tan.
267 Not to be confused with ga-(Ø-)jex-i(-t) 'satiate yourself.
268 Also cognate are the verbs (Ø-Ø-)s-jgvn-i 'you (will) prešent X/them to Y/them as a
    gift' and in the Prešent Sub-Series only (Ø-Ø-)s-)gvn-ob 'you convey gift/greeting
    X to Y/them'.
269
    In the second IIIustration offered by KEGl (vol. VIII) the meaning is rather 'agree
    with X on Y' with two Dative nominals (viz. gio tamasuk-is da+c'er+a-ši ert
    katam-s (?Ø-)gv-jer-d-eb-a 'in writing a note acknowledging the debt Gio comes
    to agreement with us on one chicken'), for which meaning KEGl gives the gloss h-
    q'abul-d-eb-i , though the only example for this verb where the entity agreed upon
    is stated has it not in the Dative but governed by -ze (viz. da-h-q'abul-d-a at
    tuman-ze 'X agreed with Y on ten tenners').
270 In response to the greeting ro+gora x-a+r-t? 'How are you?' one may say tkven
    ro+gor g-i-k'itx-o-t? as the translation-equivalent of 'And how are you?.
271 Cf. ma-txov-ar-i (with syncopating suffixal vowel) or ma-txov-ar-a (Genitive in
    -ar-a-s ) 'beggar'.
272 Recall that this is the regular Aorist conjugation for the root, as in (ga-mo-)(Ø-Ø-
    Ø-)a-k'l-eb 'you (will) subtract X/them from Y/them'.
273 E.g. ded-is juju maga-s š ( Ø - ) r g - e b - i - a                 'X's mother's breast evidently did X
    some good'.
274 E.g. m - k ' b - e n - a r - a jagl-i/k'b+il-i            'biting dog/tooth' vs m-c'ixl-av-s c'in da-
    (Ø-)u-dg-eb-i-an,              m - k ' b - e n - a r - s uk'ana-o 'they will stand in front of a kicker
    and behind a biter, they say'.
275 N.B. t'uš-ze/tit-ze (Ø-?Ø-)i-k'b-en                         'you (will) bite yourself on the lip/finger in
    realisation and regret at something' vs ena-ze (Ø-?Ø-)i-k'b-en                             'you (will) bite
     yourself on the tongue to stop yourself saying anything further'.
276 For a more regular formation in perfective screeves consider the form in the
    proverb: buz-i rom tav-ze da-g-bzu-i-s, k'ogo-c maä+in da-g-k'b-en-s-o
    'While the fly is buzzing around your head, the mosquito too will then bite you, they
    say'.
277 Also heard, though condemned by prescriptivists, is (Ø-Ø-)i-a+xl-eb-i.
278 Without preverb this verb-form means 'mention': N.B. the saying when someone
    hiccups vin g-a-xs+en-eb-s? 'who is mentioning you?' (= vi-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-gon-
     d-i? 'who has recalled you?'). With ga- or š                       the verb-form means 'remind X/them
     of Y/them' (e.g. da+vic'q'+eb+ul-i da+p'ir+eb+a š / g a - ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) a - x s + e n - e
     direkt'or-s 'remind the director of (his) forgotten promise').
279 This is the Causative of (da-)(Ø-Ø-)?s-c-em 'you (will) knock X/them down', and the
     obligatory noun in this expression for 'sneeze' is cxvir-i 'nose'.
280 This example from D. Mačxaneli is quoted in KEGl under d a a m t k n a r e b s .
281 This is in addition to a separate synthetic form that corresponds inGEORGIANto a
     Transitive Verb in the Imperfect Indicative but with an indirect object alongside the
     direct object (e.g. from the lashkh dialect x-(Ø-Ø-)a-gm-ina""-x-i =GEORGIAN(Ø-Ø-
     Ø-)u-šen-eb-d-i t u r m e 'you were building X/them for Y/them apparently').
282 Note how the Prešent-Stative formant - i - is treated as part of the root here.
283 Such is the form prešented by Topuria on pp. 132-133, but on p. 135 the same Svan
     form (= lә-m-č'ued-iel) is rendered as na-k'itx-eb-a , with -eb- replacing -av- .

5    Syntax5.Ø General SyntaxOnceGEORGIANverbal morphology has been mastered, the syntax of the
language is reasonably straightforward. Its subordinate clauses, unlike
those of North Caucasian languages, do not differ markedly from the
familiar structures of typical Indo-European languages with their use of
conjunctions plus interplay of indicative and subjunctive finite verb-forms.
However, so that those interested in syntax can approach this chapter
without necessarily having to work through all the detail prešented in the
preceding chapters (especially Chapter 4), I now include a short resumé of
the non-syntactic component ofGEORGIANgrammar.","[525, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542]"

Though in origin compounds consisting of (a) a reduplication of the cardinal
ert-i 'one', with the first instantiation in the Ergative case, and (b) a fusion
of this same cardinal (this time in the Nominative) with the ordinal
me+or+e 'second', the words today simply function as object-fIIIers, much
like their English counterparts 'one another/each other', e.g.      čem-ma    megobar-ma      ert+man+et-s       ga-gv-(Ø-)a-cn-o

There are three main ways of forming Intransitives for the screeves of
Series I and II—in Series III single pattern is followed (or rather there
is one uniform pattern for monopersonal Intransitives and a distinct but
uniform pattern for bipersonal Intransitives). The formations are known in
GEORGIANas (i) prefixai passives (p'repiks+ul-i vn+eb+it-i), (ii) d-
passives (don+ian-i vn+eb+it-i), and (iii) markerless passives (u+nišn+o
vn+eb+it-i). Type i, the most widespread type, places the vowel i-, which
in origin was presumably the Subjective Version vowel, immediately before
the verbal root; type ii places the consonant -d (called inGEORGIANdon-i)
                             VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                            277immediately after the root; type iii has no particular distinguishing feature.
When an indirect object is associated with an Intransitive Verb in screeves
of Series I and II, the noun stands in the Dative case and either the
version-system is employed or the agreement-prefix is placed immediately
before the root, depending on the verb in question: type i forms simply
change their i-prefix to the Indirect Object Versioniser e-, whereas the
other two types, unless the agreement-prefix stands immediately before the
root, will use either the Objective or locative Versioniser, as appropriate
according to the šense. Types ii and iii always employ the Thematic Suffix
-eb (placed immediately after the d-suffix of type ii) in Series I screeves,
whilst type i use a selection of Thematic Suffixes, depending on the sub­
class of the verb concerned.
    AlthoughGEORGIANphilology styles all verbs belonging to the class we
are about to describe as being of 'passive voice' (vn+eb+it-i gvar-i), by
no means all the relevant verbs are true passives, which is why we have
designated them as 'Intransitive'—for example, (ga-)i-g-eb-a, the
Intransitive equivalent of the Transitive (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-g-eb 'you (will)
open X/them', does not mean 'it is being (will be) opened'; rather it is either
a simple intransitive 'X is opening (will open)' or a potential with the šense
'X may be opened/is openable'. If we add an indirect object to this
monovalent form, this indirect object will, semantically speaking, be either
a possessive or benefactive (cf. k'ošk'-s ga-(Ø-)e-g-eb-a k'ar-i 'the
door of the tower will open' vs ga-m-e-g-o samotx-is k'ar-i 'the door
of heaven opened unto me = I achieved happiness'). However, with some
verbs, where the potential šense is to the fore, the indirect object will
reprešent the entity who is or, more likely, is not able to carry out the
relevant verbal action (cf. e+s p'ur-i i-č'm-eb-a 'this bread is edible' vs   šen-i     p'ur-i       adam+ian-s ar          (Ø-)e-č'm-eb-a
   your-AGR bread-NOM person-DAT not             (him-)IOV-eat-TS-it
   'a human being cannot eat your bread'52)    However, it is type i Intransitives which are most likely to carry true
passive force, and in the case of the verb 'bake', which has both a prefixai
and a markerless formation, the former (i-cx-ob-a) has passive meaning
'X is being baked', whilst the latter (cxv-eb-a) is just intransitive 'X (e.g.
the bread) is baking'. Intransitives formed by means of the suffixal
mechanism often have the force of an inceptive (viz. 'begin.../become...').
    A syntactic peculiarity of some formally monopersonal Intransitives is
that they are construed with a second argument that looks suspiciously like
a direct object, thus rendering them bivalent, but, because such verbs are
278                        GEORGI AN GRAMMARonly used in the Prešent Sub-Series, it is impossible to tell. Examples
include: (active voice) Transitive (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-jl-ev kal-s rč+ev+a-s 'you
give advice to the woman' (for this verb see 4.1) vs (formally passive voice)
Intransitive (Ø-?Ø-)i-jl-ev-i rč+ev+a-s 'you give (out) advice'53; (active
voice) Transitive ra ambav-s (Ø-)g-c'er-en? 'what news are they
writing to you?' vs (formally passive voice) Intransitive g a z e t - e b - i
i+s+e+t ambav-s (?Ø-)i-c'er-eb-a, rom gada-(Ø-)i-r-ev-i 'the
papers write such news that you'll go bananas'; (active voice) Transitive
ga+marjv+eb-is ambav-s (Ø-)m-a-t'q'-ob-in-eb-d-nen 'they were
informing me of the news of the victory' vs (formally passive voice)
Intransitive ga+marjv+eb-is ambav-s (?Ø-)i-t'q'-ob-in-eb-od-nen
'they were reporting the news of victory'. There are other (formally
passive) Intransitives which, however, have no active voice Transitive
counterparts, which exist in all Series, and which are similarly construed
with either one or possibly two Dative nominals across the Series. Here
they are prescriptively treated as Intransitives across their paradigms,
such that even in Series II they have Nominative subject combined with
one or two Dative nominals (e.g. deda zgap'ar-s mo-h-q'v-a 'mother
narrated a fairy-tale' vs deda zgap'ar-s bavšv-s mo-(?Ø-Ø-)u-q'v-a
'mother narrated a fairy-tale to the child'), though in speech one does hear
the construction with these verbs 'regularised' according to Transitive
norms, with Ergative subject and Nominative direct object (viz. deda-m
zgap'ar-i mo-h-q'v-a 'mother narrated a fairy-tale' vs d e d a - m
zgap'ar-i bavšv-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)u-qV-a 'mother narrated a fairy-tale to
the child').","[295, 296, 297]"
"4.7.3.4 Preverbal Medials marking the moderate application of the verbal
activity
The addition of c'a- to basic Mediais in perfective screeves indicates that
the action is carried out to a small degree only. By my reckoning, KEGl
quotes circa 6Ø such verb-forms 98 . It prešents a further 5Ø or so verb-
forms where the preverb c'a-mo- is coupled to a basic Medial in the
perfective screeves; some of these are glossed in the same way as for
c'a-, namely 'X will VERB a little', but the majority seem to indicate a swift,
sudden (perhaps somewhat rude?) action on the part of the subject. For
c'a- we have examples like: c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-varjiš-eb 'you will take a bit
of exercise'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-gund-av-eb 'you will have a bit of a snowball
fight'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-vaxšm-eb 'you will have a light dinner'; c'a-(Ø-

xlič+in-eb 'you will utter something a bit hoarsely'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-xumr-
eb 'you will have a bit of a joke'.
     With indirect object we have formally prefixal bipersonal Intransitive
Verbs, such as: c'a-(Ø-Ø-)e-tamaš-eb-i 'you will play with X/them a
little' (Perfect c'a-(Ø-)s-tamaš-eb-i-x-a+r); c'a-g-e-mat'-eb-a 'a
little will be added to you' (Perfect c'a-g-mat'-eb-i-a); c'a-(Ø-Ø-)e-
xumr-eb-i 'you will joke a little with X/them' (Perfect c'a-(Ø-Ø-)xumr-
eb-i-x-a+r); c'a-(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i 'you will start talking to
X/them who are close to you'.
     One then finds such colloquialisms in the Prešent Sub-Series only as:
c'a-(?Ø-)i-boršč-eb-s 'it somewhat resembles borshch', c'a-(?Ø-)i-
k'oč'l-eb-s = mo-(?Ø-)i-k'oč""l-eb-s 'X limps a bit'; c'a-(?Ø-)i-
tav+xed-eb-s 'X is somewhat arrogant'.
     For c'a-mo- we have examples like: c'a-mo-(Ø-?Ø-)i-t'ir-eb 'you
will start to cry/have a little cry'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-bod-eb 'you will
mumble something incoherently in your sleep'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-gmin-eb
'you will suddenly moan something'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-zmu+vl-eb 'you will
suddenly howl something'; c'a-mo-(Ø-?Ø-)i-k'nav+l-eb 'you will suddenly
mew/utter mewingly'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-k'rut'+un-eb 'you will suddenly
utter something with a purr'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-t'ik't'ik'-eb 'you will
suddenly blurt something out'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-(p)s'mu+vl-eb 'you will
suddenly gasp something out'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'bed-eb = c'a-mo-(Ø-
Ø-)roš-av = c ' a - m o - ( Ø - Ø - ) a - q ' r a n t ' a l - e b 'you will suddenly
blurt/blabber something out'; c'a-mo-(?Ø-)i-kux-eb-s 'there will be a
sudden clap of thunder'; c'a-mo-(Ø-?Ø-)i-q'el + q'el-av-eb 'you will
suddenly push yourself forward'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-xrant'al-eb 'you will
splutter/stammer suddenly something'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-xrinc'+ial-eb
'you will suddenly utter something hoarsely'.
     When c'a-mo- replaces the normal preverbs (da-/mo-/mi-) for the
bipersonal prefixal Intransitive Verb 'help', we get c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)e-
xmar-eb-i 'you will give X/them a little help'.
     Without versioniser there is: c'a-mo-žinžgl-av-s 'there will be a little
light rain', but for 'raining' either a parallel form is possibe, viz. c'a-mo-
c'vim-s 'there will be a drop of rain', or both versioniser and Thematic
Suffix are used, as in c'a-mo-(?Ø-)i-c'vim-eb-s.
358                           GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.7.3.5 Medial Verbs with Indirect Object (Relative Medials)
Indirect objects with Medials are marked in a variety of ways.
     In some cases the Objective Version may be used in the expected way
to create an indirect object for the verb. For some verbs this is only
possible in the Prešent Sub-Series. Examples: sisxl-i g-i-dug-s 'your
blood is boiling'; mgel-s k'b+il-eb-i cecxl-i-vit                  (Ø-)u-el-av-s/(Ø-)u-
el+v+ar-eb-s 'the wolfs teeth flash like fire'; mtel-i sxeul-i m-i-špot-
av-s, m-i-trt-i-s = m-i-trt+ol-av-s = m-i-k'ank'al-eb-s = m - i -
caxcax-eb-s = m-i-)agjag-eb-s 'my whole body is roused, is shaking',
or with a different šense si+garib+e-s ar v-(Ø-)u-trt-i(-v-a+r) 'I do
not quake before poverty' (cf. jar-i ar (Ø-)u-prtx-i-s 99                 si+cx+e-s 'the
army is not afraid of the heat'). Where the Thematic Suffix is -eb in both
Prešent and Future Sub-Series, such forms in Objective Version may be
ambiguous between Prešent of the basic Medial and Future of the
(pseudo-)Causative. And so, if we take the Future of trt-i-s, we get
(?Ø-)i-trt+ol-eb, which gives the (pseudo-)Causative                   (Ø-)a-trt+ol-eb-s
'X makes (will make) Y/them tremble', which in Objective Version is (Ø-
Ø-)u-trt+ol-eb-s 'X (will) make Y/them tremble for Z/them', and this is
given in KEGl with the glosses                           (Ø-Ø-)u-caxcax-eb-s/(Ø-Ø-)u-
k'ank'al-eb-s (and we could add (Ø-Ø-)u-)agjag-eb-s)), even though
surprisingly these verb-forms under their own entries are only glossed in
KEGl itself as though they were restricted to functioning as synonyms of
(Ø-)u-trt-i-s.             However, for other verbs the Objective Version is
acceptable throughout Series I and 11 (e.g. (Ø-Ø-)u-q'vir-i/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-
q'vir-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-q'vir-e/g-i-q'vir-(n-)i-?a m-is-tvis 'you shout/
will shout/ shouted/ have shouted at X';                   (Ø-Ø-)u-mger(-i)/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-
mger-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-mger-e/g-i-mger-(n-)i-?a m-is-tvis 'you sing/
will sing/sang/have sung to X'; ga-(Ø-Ø-)u-rb-i-x-a+r/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)
u-rb-en/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-rb-in-e/ga-g-i-rb-en-i-a m-is-gan 'you
run/will run/ran/have run away from X').
     Sometimes the indirect object along with its agreement-prefix is simply
added to the basic Medial in the Prešent Sub-Series (e.g. (Ø-)p'asux-ob
'you give an answer' vs (Ø-)h-p'asux-ob 'you answer X/them' 1 Ø Ø ;
(Ø-)q'araul-ob = (Ø-)daraj-ob = q'araul-ada x-a+r 'you are on guard'
vs (Ø-)h-q'araul-ob = (Ø-)s-daraj-ob 'you guard X/them'). However, in
the Future Sub-Series and in Series 11 the Objective Version has to be
used when the indirect object is prešent (e.g. (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-p'asux-eb/(Ø-
?Ø-Ø-)u-p'asux-e 'you will answer/ answered X/them'; (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-
q'araul-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-q'araul-e = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-daraj-eb/(Ø-?Ø-
Ø-)u-daraj-e 'you will guard/guarded X/them'); (Ø-Ø-)h-k'arnax-
o b / ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) u - k ' a r n a x - e b ) 'you (will) direct X/themI O in the
                             VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                              359writing/thinking of Y/themDO' behaves the same way. In Series III the
basic Medial formation is used and the underlying indirect object surfaces
as the postpositional object of - t v i s (e.g. sa+gare+o           sa+km+e-ta
minist'r-s (Ø-)u-p'asux-(n-)i-?a šen-tvis 'the Foreign Minister has
answered you').
      In the case of (Ø-Ø-)švel-i 'you aid X/them' (Imperfect (Ø-Ø-)švel-
od-i) the verb cannot be used without an indirect object, and although in
the Future Sub-Series and Series 11 the Objective Version is employed, the
usual Thematic Suffix -eb does not substitute for -i, giving the Future (Ø-
?Ø-Ø-)u-švel-i 'you will help X/them' (for which Vogt quotes the
Conditional (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-Svel-i-d-i)—N.B. 'help!' is (Ø-?Ø-)m-i-švel-el.
      For 'offer' the Future does substitute -eb but additionally takes the
preverb š ( m o - ) (viz. (Ø-Ø-)s-tavaz-ob 'you offer X/them to Y/them' =>
Future še-(mo-}(Ø-Ø-)s-tavaz-eb); in the Perfect this Thematic Suffix is
retained, giving še-(mo-)g-i-tavaz-eb-i-a                -tvis, Pluperfect š e -
(mo-)g-e-tavaz-eb-in-a -tvis.
      For 'laugh at, mock' the endings in all Series are the same as for the
basic Medial (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-i 'you laugh' (Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb =>
Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-e => Perfect g-i-cin-i-?a), but in the Future Sub-
Series and in Series 11 the indirect object prefix takes the place of the i-
versioniser and in addition the preverb da- is always prešent, giving da-
(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-i/da-(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-eb 'you (will) mock X/them'. This
contrasts with the Objective Version coupled to the basic Medial (Ø-Ø-)u-
cin-i/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-cin-eb 'you (will) look at X/them and laugh' 1Ø1
(Perfect ga-g-i-cin-i-?a -tvis), which has the synonym še-(mo-)(Ø-)s-
cin-i/še-(mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-eb (Perfect še-(mo-)g-i-cin-eb-i-?a
-tvis); cf. the semelfactives ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you will break into a
laugh' (Perfect ga-g-i-cin-i-?a), ča-(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you will laugh
quietly to yourself' vs ča-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-cin-eb 'you will laugh quietly to
X/them' (Perfect ša-g-i-cin-i-?a -tvis). The formally bipersonal (but
monovalent) prefixal Intransitive Verb-form (ga-)g-e-cin-eb-?a is, of
course, an Indirect Verb (see 4.7.4) with the 2nd person addressee here the
(unintentional) laugher as the verb-form means 'you (will) break out into a
laugh' (=> Aorist ga-g-e-cin-?a => Perfect ga-g-cin-eb-i-?a).
      [It might be thought that 'smile' would behave the same way as 'laugh',
but this is not so. KEGl recognises no verb-form of the type *(Ø-)gim-
i / ( Ø - ? Ø - ) i - g i m - e b , quoting g i m - i as an alternative to the
Masdar/abstract-noun gim+il-i; and Tschenkčli's Dictionary quotes such a
Prešent Indicative as (Ø-)gim-i only as a theoretical construct on the
basis of the form (Ø-Ø-)u-gim-i with Objective Version, given below.
(ga-)(Ø-)i-gim-eb-i is a normal Intransitive Verb 'you (will) smile' (Aorist

alternative inverted Series III set of screeves with Perfect ga-g-i-gim-i-

morpho-syntax with Future ga-g-e-gim-eb-?a => Aorist ga-g-e-gim-?a
=> Perfect ga-g-g im-eb-i-a. The form da-(Ø-Ø-)gim-i 'you look
smilingly down upon X/them' is restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series and
should be compared with a group of similar verb-forms prešented under
'see' in 4.1Ø. However, the parallels še-(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)gim-i 'you look

ga-mo-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a/ga-mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a), which does not differ
in meaning from ekim-s ga-mo-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-eb (Aorist ekim-s ga-
mo-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-e, Perfect ekim-is-tvis ga-mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-?a).
With Objective Version attached to the basic Medial we have (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-
jax-i (Imperfect (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-d-i/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-od-i), which
means either 'you (will) shout to X/them' or analysed as (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-i
'you (will) give the name X to Y/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-e => Perfect
g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a -tvis), in which latter šense (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-c'od-eb 1 0 3    is a
synonym; in the Prešent Sub-Series only (Ø-(?)Ø-Ø-)e-)ax-i (Imperfect
(Ø-(?)Ø-Ø-)e-)ax-(o)d-i) is also a synonym for both usages. As a
semelfactive in the perfective screeves there is da-(Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-eb 'you
will shout out (something)' (Perfect da-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a) and in Objective
Version da-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-eb 'you will shout out (something) to X/them'
(Perfect da-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a -tvis). da-(Ø-(Ø-))s-]ax-i is limited to the
Prešent Sub-Series and means 'shout down (something) to X/them'. še-(Ø-

(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb (Perfect še-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis), though KEGl also
quotes, interestingly without any indirect object affix indicated, š ( Ø -
?Ø-)jax-eb 'you will shout out in excitement' (Perfect še-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-
?a). With preverb š e - m o - only še-mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb is quoted in
KEGl but with two meanings and two partly differentiated paradigms: in
the šense 'you will start to sing out song X' the Perfect is še-mo-g-i-)ax-
(n-)i-a, whilst in the šense of 'you will address (some words) loudly to a
by-stander Y' the Perfect is š m o - g - i - ) a x - e b - i - a -tvis). For ča-(Ø-
Ø-)s-]ax-i/ša-(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb 'you (will shout something down into at
X/them' the Perfect is given as ča-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis, whereas for a-
(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb 'you will shout something up to X/them' only non-Prešent
Sub-Series forms are given (Perfect a-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis). mo-(Ø-
?Ø-)s-)ax-i is glossed as 'you sound a reply to X/them' or 'you follow
someone coming in this direction shouting at them' whilst mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-
eb (Perfect mo-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a -tvis) is said to be a synonym for the
locative Versional mo-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)ax-eb (Perfect mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a
-tvis) 'you will suddenly hurl a loud verbal message hither at X/them' 104;
and mi-(Ø-?Ø-)s-)ax-i is 'you follow someone going somewhere else
shouting at them', with mi-(Ø-Ø-)s-]ax-eb (Perfect mi-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a
-tvis) said to be a synonym for the locative Versional mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-
jax-eb (Perfect mi-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis) 'you will suddenly hurl a loud
verbal message thither at X/them'105.
    The pattern just illustrated with preverbs m o - / m i - combining with the
locative Version is found with a number of other verbs to indicate
suddenly shouting at someone with the particular voice-quality of the
verbal root. Examples: mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'vir-eb 'you will suddenly
yell something at X/them' (Perfect mo-/mi-g-i-q'vir-eb-i-a -tvis); m o -
/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'iv+l-eb 'you will suddenly crow something at X/them'
(Perfect mo-/mi-g-i-q'iv+l-eb-i-a -tvis); mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'ir-eb
'you will suddenly tearfully shout something at X/them' (Perfect mo-/mi-g-
i-t'ir-eb-i-a -tvis);mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-čxav+l-eb1Ø6                      'you will suddenly
screech/mew something at X/them' (Perfect mi-g-i-čxav+1-eb-i-a
-tvis). For the corresponding forms of 'bark' KEGl quotes only mi-(?Ø-
Ø-)a-q'ep-s '(dog) will bark at X/them' as a synonym for da-/še-(?Ø-
Ø-)u-q'ep-s; the form also differs structurally from those just listed
insofar as it has the Perfect mi-(Ø-)u-q'ep-(?n-)i-?a -tvis.
    Sometimes the e-versioniser is employed, and the verb-form has the
morpho-syntactic patterning in Series 1 and 11 of a bipersonal prefixal
Intransitive (which is to say that the subject in Series II stands in the
Nominative); in these cases there is often no formal difference between
362                       GEORGl AN GRAMMARPrešent and Future Sub-Series. When there is no preverb associated with
this formation, Series 111 departs from the morpho-syntax of an
Intransitive Verbs and simply takes the basic Medial (inverted) verb-form,
making the indirect object dependent on a suitable postposition. With two
such verbs there is a formal difference between Prešent and Future Sub-
Series: from     (Ø-)i-brjv-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-brj+ol-eb 'you (will) fight' we have
(Ø-Ø-)e-brjv-i 'you fight X/them' => Future (Ø-Ø-)e-brj+ol-eb-i =>
Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-brj+ol-e => Perfect g-i-brj+ol-(n-)i-?a -tan; but from
(Ø-(Ø-))i-svr-i/(Ø-Ø-)i-sr+ol-eb 'you (will) shoot (X/them)' we have (Ø-
(Ø-)Ø-)e-svr-i 'you (will) shoot (X/them) at Y/them', which then gives the
Aorist (Ø-(Ø-)Ø-)e-sr+ol-e, which, though formally the expected shape,
is treated as a Transitive Verb with Ergative subject and 3rd person plural
marked by -es (rather than the anticipated -nen); the Perfect is g-i-svr-
i-a/g-i-sr+ol-(?n-)i-a -tvis. Further examples: (Ø-Ø-)e-čurčul-eb-i
'you (will) whisper/talk in whispers to X/them' => Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-čurčul-e
=> Perfect g-i-čurčul-(n-)i-a -tvis-, (Ø-Ø-)e-(5ipc?ip-eb-i 'you (will)
talk with a lisp to X/them' (no Series III); (Ø-Ø-)e-k'amat-eb-i 'you (will)
argue with X/them' => Perfect g-i-k'amat-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-čxub-
eb-i => Perfect g-i-čxub-(?n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i 'you
(will) speak with X/them' => Perfect g-i-lap'arak'-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-
Ø-)e-musaip-eb-i = (Ø-Ø-)e-sa+ub+r-eb-i = (Ø-Ø-)e-maslaat-eb-i
= (Ø-Ø-)e-baas-eb-i 'you (will) converse with X/them' => Perfect g-i-
musaip-(n-)i-?a (etc..) -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-tamaš-eb-i 'you (will) play with
X/them' => g-i-tamaš-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-aršiq'-eb-i 'you (will) flirt
with X/them' => g-i-aräiq'-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-xumr-eb-i 'you (will)
joke with X/them' => Perfect g-i-xumr-(?n-)i-?a -tan.
    Some of these bipersonal Intransitive derivatives may also permit a
preverb to be used in the perfective screeves, the meaning of which seems
to be little more than an inceptive (plus an indirect object). The morpho-
syntax of these forms is entirely regular across the three Series, such that
in Series III they remain faithful to the bipersonal Intransitive paradigm
taking their subject in the Nominative and forming the screeves on a
notional Masdar-stem that incorporates the Thematic Suffix -eb (as noted
in Hewitt 1987a.335-336; and as discussed by Tuite 1993). Examples: da-
(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i      = ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i = g a - m o -
(Ø-Ø-)e-sa+ub+r-eb-i         'you will engage X/them in conversation' =>
Perfect da-(Ø-Ø-)lap'arak'-eb-i-x+ar = ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)lap'arak'-eb-
i-x+ar = ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)sa+ub+r-eb-i-x+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-tamaš-eb-i
'you will start to play with X/them' => Perfect ga-(Ø-)s-tamaš-eb-i-
x+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-aršiq'-eb-i 'you will start to flirt with X/them' =>
Perfect ga-(Ø-Ø-)aršiq'-eb-i-x+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-xumr-eb-i 'you will

take issue with X/them' => Perfect še-lØ-)h-k'amat-eb-i-x-a+r.
    Occasionally the preverbal form changes from an Intransitive to
Transitive Verb-form with indirect object, so that if a person will start a
conversation with someone at his side, this may be expressed literally,
using one of the Intransitive Verb-forms just prešented, as: gverd-it
m+q'+op-s ga-mo-(Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-a; alternatively the Transitive
form (i+s) gada-(?Ø-Ø-}u-lap'arak'-eb-s (Aorist (man) gada-(?Ø-
Ø-)u-lap'arak'-a, Perfect (ma-s) gada-(Ø-)u-lap'arak'-eb-i-?a 107
ma-s-tan) encapsulates this notion entirely within itself; if the speaking to
one's neighbour is soft, then (5a-(?Ø-Ø-)u-lap,arak,-eb-s is used, which,
according to KEGl, contrasts with the bipersonal Intransitive with this
preverb, namely ča-(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i, for which the meaning is
'you will talk down to X/them' (e.g. of a person to a dog). Another such
Transitive is ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-tamaš-eb 'you will skirt X/them playing;
you will start to play with X/them' (Perfect ga-g-i-tamaš-eb-i-?a -tan),
where, however, we have an alternative Intransitive, but this time it is the
inceptive suffixal Intransitive in Objective Version (viz. ga-(Ø-Ø-)u-
tamaš-d-eb-i => Perfect ga-(Ø-)s-tamaš-eb-i-x-a+r)!
364                          GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.7.4 Indirect Verb Class (inversi+ul-i zmn-eb-is k'las-i)However they were originally conceived, Indirect Verbs today are those
whose (logical) subject, no matter what the Series, stands in the Dative
case and is co-referenced in the verb-form by means of an agreement-
affix of Set B, whilst the (logical) direct object, no matter what the Series,
stands in the Nominative case and is co-referenced in the verb-form by
means of an agreement-affix of Set A—allGEORGIANverbs must carry at
the very least a Set A affix, but for some Indirect Verbs there may be no
Nominative nominal external to the verb to provide a concrete referent for
the relevant affix. Since the Dative nominal is today perceived to be the
subject, an appropriate 3rd person plural Dative will have its plurality
marked on the verb but only in the prešence of a 3rd person direct object,
whilst the plurality of a 3rd person Nominative will, of course, never be
marked on the verb today, because this is viewed as the direct object, and
direct objects do not (prescriptively at any rate) have their plurality
signalled in the verb. This gives us, for example, mk'vidr-eb-s s-)ul-t
m o + m + x d + u r - i / m o + m + x d + u r - e b - i 'the natives hate the incomer/
incomers', which is a reversal of the older pattern of agreement, whereby
the plurality of the 3rd person Dative was ignored, whilst that of the 3rd
person Nominative was indeed marked on the verb, giving as the older
part-equivalent to the above: mk'vidr-s/mk'vidr-eb-s                          s-)ul-an
mo+m+xd+ur-eb-i 'the native/natives hate(s) the incomers'. This devel­
opment in the pattern of agreement suggests that originally it was the
Nominative nominal which was interpreted as the subject, whereas the
Dative nominal will at that time have been the indirect object of a normal
bivalent Intransitive Verb; such agreement is common in traditional folk­
tales and is found in the works of the late 19th to the early 2Øth century
writer Vazha Pshavela.
     It is sometimes difficult, especially with verbs containing the Indirect
Object Versioniser, to tell whether we are dealing with a bivalent
Intransitive Verb or an Indirect Verb. In 4.1 we mentioned the different
agreement-patterns for the verb 'be born to' as attested in the two
examples from the 19th century writers Ilia C'avč'avadze and Ak'ak'i
Ts'ereteli respectively, namely:      si+t'q'v+a-n-i gul-ši       m-e-bad-eb-i-an
      word-Pl-NOM      heart-in me-IOV-be.born-TS-PRES.INDIC-PL
      'words/speeches are born to me in the heart (= are born in my heart)'
                            VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                            365vs
     šv+il-eb-i       (Ø-)e-bad-eb-a-t
     child-Pl-NOM (3rd.PER-)I OV-be.born-TS-3rd.PER-Pl
     'children are born to themDAT'Does this feature alone mean that the former verb-form is to be
interpreted as a bivalent Intransitive, whilst the latter is to be viewed as
an Indirect Verb? Similarly, if we translate the example p'at'ar+jal-i gv-
e-čven-o-s, p'at'ar+jal-i! 'let the bride shew herself to us, the bride!',
we would judge it to be a bivalent Intransitive, whereas if we translate the
example cot'a maril+ian-i m-e-čven-a sa+č'm+el-i 'I deemed the
food a little salty', we might be tempted to regard the verb as Indirect
(because the 1st person Dative argument is rendered in English as the
subject of the verb), whereas the translation 'the food seemed to me a little
salty' would perhaps favour a bivalent Intransitive interpretation (with 'to
me' equating to the Dative argument of theGEORGIAN).Personally, however,
I would argue that both these verbs in all the usages illustrated above are
to be interpreted as bivalent Intransitives.
    In the Prešent Sub-Series the Dative subject is sometimes marked by
means of the agreement-affix alone; alternatively some verb-forms require
the prešence of the Objective Version, others the prešence of the locative
Version, and yet others the prešence of the Indirect Object Version. In
the Future Sub-Series, on the other hand, many Indirect Verbs take the
form of a prefixal Intransitive with obligatory e-versioniser.       Indirect
Verbs proper possess no Series II screeves, and so the Imperfect and
Prešent Subjunctive will take the place of the anticipated Aorist Indicative
and Aorist Subjunctive respectively. The Imperfect Indicative (and Prešent
Subjunctive) will take either -d- or -od- as post-radical marker according
to the requirements of the verb-form in question. In Series III Indirect
Verbs have the basic morphology of bivalent Intransitives, which is to say
that the stem is the Masdar, though it is of course necessary to know the
correct form of the Masdar, which in some cases might not be a
straightforward matter.
    In the Prešent Indicative a 1st or 2nd person direct object is indicated
by attaching to the stem the appropriate form of the Prešent tense of the
copula, whilst a 3rd person Nominative nominal is indicated by either -s or
-a, as required by the verb in question. Since it is verb-forms rather than
roots which are classified for conjugational type, readers will by now have
come to expect that the root of any given Indirect Verb is likely to have
cognate verb-forms of other conjugational types; these will be pointed out
as we go along.
366                         GEORGIANGRAMMAR    l e t us illustrate the general principles of formation according to
screeve-(Sub-)Series by taking first the root -nd- 'want', which, when the
direct object is 1st or 2nd person adds an extra - i - between root and
agreement-suffix. The basic paradigms shew changing Dative subject
keeping a constant 3rd person Nominative direct object (producing
meanings for the Prešent Indicative of this root of 'I want X/them', 'you
want X/them', etc.):

part-exponent for the Dative subject. With variable arguments for the
Prešent Indicative we have: m-i-nd-i-x-a+r 'I want you', m-i-nd-i-x-
a+r-t 'I want you(Pl)', g-i-nd-i-v-a+r 'you want me', g-i-nd-i-v-a+r-t

i-nd-i-x-a+r(-t) 'we want you(/you(Pl.))'. The Imperfect and Prešent
Subjunctive follow the normal patterns of agreement, as demonstrated by:
m-i-nd-od-i(-t) 'I wanted you(/you(Pl.))', (Ø-Ø-)u-nd-od-i(-t) 'X/they
wanted you(/you(Pl.))', rom g-i-nd-od-e 'if you were wanting me', rom g-
i-nd-od-e-t 'if you/you(Pl.) were wanting us' or 'if you(Pl) were wanting
me/X/them'.
     In the Future Sub-Series the verb takes on the morphology of a
bivalent prefixal Intransitive but with a root now expanded to -nd+om-
(cf. the Masdar nd+om-a 'wanting'), producing the following paradigms:      Future Sub-Series of -nd-

    Series 11 does not exist. Series 111 is based on the stem of the Masdar,
namely -nd+om-, to which the Thematic Suffix -eb- is added. This b a š

    The forms given above for the Future Sub-Series have a stative force
as far as their semantics are concerned, namely 'be in a state of wanting'.
However, in English such statements as 'I (etc..) shall want X' may be taken
to mean 'I (etc..) shall experience a desire for X' or 'I (etc..) shall conceive
a desire for X'. The former of these alternative interpretations is treated
inGEORGIANas a Dynamic equivalent to the Stative forms already set out
and consists morphologically of the sequence Preverb mo- + Agreement-

xan+da+xan k'oxt'+a+oba mo-(Ø-)u-nd-eb-od-a 'Datuna from time to
time would experience the desire to be dressed neatly', the forms may
convey the notion 'need' (e.g. vano-s 1+od+in-i did+xan+s ar mo-
(Ø-)u-nd-eb-a 'Vano will not need to wait long'). Clearly with these
meanings the verb-forms are still functioning Indirectly insofar as the
subject is still the Dative nominal. However, the verb-form (throughout its
paradigm) may function as a 'normal' (i.e. non-Indirect) Intransitive Verb;
the subject is now the Nominative nominal, and the verb, functioning as a
synonym to the Transitive Verbs (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-nd+om-eb or (še-)(Ø-
Ø-Ø-)a-l-ev 'you (will) devote X (often = amount of time) to activity Y',
may be construed with two Dative (object) nominals (thus: pot-a-mde or
dge-s v-(?Ø-Ø-)u-nd-eb-i/mo-v-(?Ø-Ø-)u-nd-eb-l/mo-v-(?Ø-Ø-)u-
nd-i/mo-v-(?Ø-Ø-)nd+om-eb-i-v-a+r si+a+r+ul-s 'I am giving/shall

digging the earth').
    The second alternative interpretation mentioned above is treated in
GEORGIANas an active voiced Transitive Verb of the form (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-
nd+om-eb 'you (will) conceive a desire for X/them', which behaves like
any normal Transitive Verb with Thematic Suffix -eb in terms both of its
morphology and syntax, e.g.      g lex-ma       c'er+a=k'itx+v-is sc'avl+a           mo-(Ø-)i-nd+om-a

      'the peasant conceived a desire to study writing and reading'   The final versional form, given that we have illustrated the locative
and Subjective forms already, is the Objective, as seen in examples like:

(but only in the Present Indicative!) we have the root -kv- 'have inanimate

such forms as m-a-kv-x-a+r 'I have you' are artificial and not met.
Colloquially the Present Indicative is often reduced to: m-a-k, g-a-k,
(Ø-)a-k, gv-a-k, g-a-k-t, (Ø-)a-k-t.
    In the Future Sub-Series suppletion occurs, the form being the
bipersonal equivalent of the Future Sub-Series of the copula; such notions
as 'X will have Y' are literally then in origin in Georgian 'Y will be to/for X'
(consider Latin id ei erit), thus:   Future Indicative        Conditional                Future Subjunctive

either k+on-a or k + on-eb-a, the latter being also used nominally as
'possessions'110), thus:

(and from there in Series 11 and III), as part of the regular active voiced
Transitive Verb (Ø-Ø-)i-k+on+i-eb 'you will acquire/have inanimate
X/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-)i-k+on+i-e, Perfect g-i-k+on+i-eb-i-a). It is
often difficult to see why in any individual instantiation of this verb
preference is given to it over the Indirect equivalent—for example there is
little to choose for the translation of 'let us hope so (lit. have hope)!'
between the Indirect expression imed-i gv-k+on-d-e-s! and the common
Transitive expression imed-i v-(Ø-)i-k+on+i-o-t!.
     By adding a preverb to the Prešent Sub-Series screeves one produces
the GEORGI AN for 'take/bring inanimate X/them in some specified
direction'—the preverbs have the same force as described for their use
with verbs of motion. Examples: c'ign-i mo-m-a-k(v-s) 'I am bringing
the book' vs ga-m-a-k(v-s) 'I am taking it out' vs a-m-a-k(v-s) 'I am
taking it up' vs še-mo-m-a-k(v-s) 'I am bringing it in' vs mi-m-a-k(v-s)
'I am taking it' vs da-m-a-k(v-s) 'I am carrying it around' 111 . Outside the
Prešent Sub-Series this notion is expressed Transitively by means of a Root
Verb with Subjective Version in the Future Sub-Series and Series II, e.g.
c'ign-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-t'an 'you will fetch the book' vs c'ign-i mo-(Ø-
Ø-)i-t'an-e 'you fetched the book' vs c'ign-i mo-g-i-t'an-i-a 'you have
fetched the book'.
     The root employed for 'have' when the possessed entity is animate
demonstrates an Indirect Verb where, in the Prešent Sub-Series, no
versioniser is used, thus:Prešent Sub-Series of -q'+av-

(5ven-i 'you(Pl) understood us', (Ø-)e-sm-i-s ma-t-i 'X understands

g-i-q'var-s 'you love X/them' (v-(Ø-)u-q'var-v-a+r 'X loves/they love
me') => Imperfect g-i-q'var-d-a => Future g-e-q'var-eb-a => Perfect g-
q'var-eb-i-a. The notion 'falling in love' is expressed as a suffixal
Intransitive, still with Dative subject, which naturally exists in all three
Series: (še-)g-i-q'var-d-eb-a 'you (will) fall in love with X/them' =>
Aorist š g - i - q ' v a r - d - a => Perfect š g - q ' v a r - e b - i - a . The notion
'conceive a love for' is expressed as a normal Transitive Verb with
Subjective Version, viz. (šXØ-Ø-)i-q'var-eb 1 1 8 'you (will) conceive a
love for X/them'; cf. the same with locative Version (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-
qVar-eb 'you (will) get X/them to love Y/them' (e.g. še-(Ø-)g-a-q'var-e
tav-i 'I got you to love me')—the Masdar of both these versional forms is
šq'var-eb-a.             The Causative hardly differs in meaning from the
previous form with locative Version (e.g. k'ac-ma še-(Ø-Ø-)a-q'var-eb-
in-a tav-i kal-s da še-(Ø-)i-rt-o 'the man got the woman to love him
and married her'). There is also in the Prešent Sub-Series the non-Indirect
Verb (Ø-)h-q'var-ob 'youNOM are the lover (= sa-q'var-el-i) of X D A T '
(e.g. čem-i col-i xel+m+c'ip+e-s h-q'var-ob-d-a 'my wife used to be
the lover of the emperor'), though this verb can also be used as a synonym
for 'love' but with Nominative subject and Dative object (e.g. kart+v+el-i

Masdar is q'var-eb-a.","[375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395]"
"Special Verbs in -ob
There is a small group of verbs containing Thematic Suffix -ob in the
Prešent Sub-Series only, which element is preceded by the past participial
formant -ul- (or -il-). All verbs in -ul-ob are Transitive and in the
Future Sub-Series and Series II incorporate the Subjective Version in their
simplest forms, with inversion in Series III. Clearly there are similarities
here with the Medials, and this feeling is reinforced by the prešence of an
optional element -n- in some of the following Series III screeves:
    (Ø-Ø-)g-eb-ul-ob 'you receive X/them regularly' contrasts with (Ø-
Ø-)i-g-eb 'you receive X/them on a specific occasion'. However, outside
the Prešent Sub-Series only one set of forms exists = Future mi-(Ø-Ø-)i-
g-eb, Aorist = mi-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e, Perfect = mi-g-i-g-i-a.
    (Ø-Ø-)g-eb-ul-ob 'you hear about X/them regularly' is a less common
parallel to the above with its alternative for specific occasions (Ø-Ø-)i-g-
eb (Future = ga-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-eb, Aorist = ga-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e, Perfect ga-g-
i-g-i-a).
    (Ø-Ø-)k,itx-ul-ob               'you read/ask about/ask X/them' => Future (Ø-

k'itx-e 270 (or plus preverb c'a- for 'read') => Perfect g-i-k'itx-av-s (or

m o - ( Ø - Ø - ) h - k ' i t x - a v an archaic form meaning 'you will seek

eb 'you (will) get X/them to read Y/them', and, although (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'itx-
v-in-eb may also be used in this šense, this latter is strictly the Causative
of 'ask' (e.g. babua-m mezobel-s šv+il+i+šv+il-is ambav-i (Ø-Ø-)a-

    The verb in -il-ob is exceptional according to the standards of the
pattern just examined. It is (Ø-Ø-)cd-il-ob 'you try (to do something)',
which in the Future Sub-Series and in Series II becomes the bivalent
prefixal Intransitive Verb (še-)(Ø-Ø-)e-cd-eb-i vs Aorist (še-)(Ø-Ø-)e-
cad-e, where we note the optionality of the preverb, (e.g. gogo (še-)
(Ø-)e-cad-a tval-eb-i ga-(Ø-)e-xil-a 'the girl tried to open her eyes').
Alongside this Intransitive Aorist we also find the Transitive (Ø-Ø-)?s-
cad-e (e.g. gogo-m (Ø-)?s-cad-a tval-eb-i ga-(Ø-)e-xil-a 'the girl
tried to open her eyes'). Again in Series III we have a choice between
Intransitive and Transitive forms: the peculiarity of the Intransitive verb is
that, though it is formally monovalent, it may take a Dative object (e.g.

noun in the relevant c a š f o r m stands before the conjunction da 'and'. If
adjectives are conjoined with an NP, the adjective preceding da can be
treated as if it were a noun and given the long desinence appropriate to
the noun it qualifies; this phenomenon is most often seen for Genitive and
Dative NPs, e.g.   (Ø-)e-rid-eb-od-a                     jvel-isa   da sa+šua+l-i

   'X shed light on several unknown and opaque problems'    An oddity was noted in literary Georgia (ll-XI-88, p. 13): as we have
seen, adjectives meaning 'possessed of N' may be freely formed by using
the derivational suffix -ian-i, so that 'a mother with a child' will be
bavšv-ian-i deda. The noun-base of such adjectives is itself qualifiable
by an adjective, and the example in question reads: ak'van-ši m+q'+op-i
bavšv-ian-i deda-c 'and a mother with a child (being) in a cradle'. A
native speaker, when prešented with this example for comment, reacted
somewhat negatively to the prešence on the epithet of the final vocalic
agreement-affix. If such compounds as m+k'vet+r+na+k'vt+eb-ian-i
'sharp-featured' (<= m+k'vet+r-i plus na+k'vt-eb-i), naz+bumbul-ian-i
'soft-downed' and lamaz+q'd-ian-i 'with beautiful covers (of books)'
reprešent the norm, then the bare stem for the adjective (namely m+q'+op)
would indeed be anticipated here. Note also the almost exact parallel to
the oddity above in Vazha Pshavela's ga+šav+eb+ul sa+rkv+el-ian-ad
'blackened cover and all', where the qualifying participle is without any
ending.
    When the kinship-terms m a m a 'father', deda 'mother', bija 'uncle',
p'ap'a/babua 'grandfather', di+deda/bebia 'grandmother', m a m + i + d a
'father's sister', and de+i+da 'mother's sister' are coupled with a possessive
adjective, the possessive is placed after the noun and written with a
hyphen to indicate that the sequence is viewed as a single word, such that
only the possessive changes for case.
    Quantifiers prescriptively require the singular form of the noun, though
538                          GEORGIANGRAMMARcolloquially the plural is also heard (e.g. or-i, ra+m(o+)den+i+me,
mraval-i cxvar-i '2/some/several sheep').
    In an example like '3 Xs of Y(s)'GEORGIANtreats 'Y' as the head of the
expression, whilst the rest functions as a complex quantifier, as exemplified
by three c a š f o r m s for the expression '3 baskets of apples', where sam-i
= '3', godor-i = 'basket', and vašl-i = 'apple':   NOMINATIVE            sam-i godor-i vašl-i

jointly can then similarly function as a complex quantifier (e.g.
na+x+ev+ar-i lit'r-i rje 'half a litre of milk').
    Quantifiers of the form 'cardinal and a half Xs' place na+x+ev+ar-i
after the noun in conjunction with which it functions as a single complex
unit (noun or adjective, as the case may be), e.g.      mo-(Ø-Ø-)m-e-c-i                                    otx-i

      'I am giving you 5 and a half kilos of carrots'    Participles behave just like simple adjectives. Those that reprešent
reduced relative clauses may be accompanied by arguments from that
clause. If the head-noun has attributes of its own, in order not to overload
the pre-nominal slot, the adjective phrase can follow the head. With active
participles of transitive verbs the underlying direct object becomes an
objective Genitive, e.g.

"Thematic Suffix -eb
The Thematic Suffix disappears without exception. For roots with vowels
the conjugation is Weak with 3rd person singular subject selecting -a;
roots without a vowel are usually Weak with 3rd person singular subject
taking -o, though if the root ends in one of the sonants - 1 / r / n the
conjugation is not only Strong with 3rd person singular subject in -o but,
when the subject is 1st or 2nd person, either an -e- or, less commonly, an
-a- will be inserted into the root. Examples:   a-v-(Ø-)a-šen-e      I built X/them   da-v-(Ø-)bad-e       I bore X/them

alternative Aorist paradigms:

    da-(Ø-)d-es                  da-(Ø-)dv-es   The root - š v is also anomalous. The paradigm below is for the
expression še+cd+om+a-s (da-)(Ø-Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-eb 'you (will) make a
mistake', where the referent of the versional object is unclear:      (še+cd+om+a) da-v-(Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-i   (še+cd+om+a) da-v-(Ø-?Ø-)u-Sv-i-t

      (še+cd+om+a) da-(Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-a        (še+cd+om+a) da-(Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-es    An additional syntactic peculiarity of this root when used in the šense
of 'release X/them' is that, although the entity 'X/them' is treated as the

entity nevertheless controls the form of the Objective Version vowel (e.g.
m t ' r - e b - i ga-v-(?Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-i 4 3 'I let the foes go' vs me, m a - t - i
mt'er-i, ga-(?Ø-)m-i-šv-es 'they let me, their enemy, go').
      Some examples for variable combinations of arguments with the verbs
'bear' and 'praise', for which root the use of the preverb is optional, would
be: da-g-bad-e-t 'I bore you(Pl)' vs 'we bore you/you(Pl.)', da-g-bad-a-t
'X bore you(Pl.)', da-(Ø-)gv-bad-e-t 'you(Pl) bore us', ( š ) m - a - k - e s
'they praised me', ( š ) g - a - k - o - t 'X praised you(Pl.)', (s'e-)g-a-k-e 'I

      Some other vowelless roots in this sub-class are seen in: k'ar-i ga-(Ø-

 (Ø-Ø-)a-g-e 'you set a trap'.","[262, 263, 264]"
"    A subtle interplay between affixal marking and preverb sometimes
becomes relevant in such cases. In the non-Prešent Sub-Series the verb
'entrust' can take either mo- or mi-, the former when the verbal activity is
directed towards either 1st or 2nd person (or, more rarely, a 3rd person if
that 3rd person is in the vicinity of either speaker or addressee), whilst the
latter implies an action aimed away from speaker or addressee. This
means that, when prešented with a form like mimabareben, the listener
knows that the 1st person agreement-affix cannot be signalling an indirect
object, as motion towards 1st person would necessitate the preverb mo-.
Hence, this verb-form will be analysed as mi-m-(Ø-)a-bar-eb-en 'they
will entrust me to X/them', making the periphrasis unnecessary. On the
other hand, momabareben can only be analysed as mo-(Ø-)m-a-bar-
eb-en 'they will entrust X/them to me'.
    The esšentials of cross-referencing within the verb of upto three
external arguments have now been explained. More will be said at the
appropriate places about the specifics of Series 111 forms for Transitive
and Medial verbs and of Indirect verbs in general. This section closes
with some further examples of agreement-patterns for different types of
Transitive and Intransitive verb-forms in Series I and II—try to spot just
the relevant affixes, ignoring other features like preverb, Version-vowel,
or Thematic Suffix that may be prešent:

commentators as Prešent(-Future) Stem Formants or Series Markers, are
elements, consisting in all cases but one of the structure VC, which attach
directly to a root (or root + Causative-marker, or root + passive/inceptive
marker -d-) for all screeves in Series I. Since the Perfect of Transitives
is formed on the Prešent stem, most Transitives keep their Thematic Suffix
also in the Perfect. The verbal noun (Masdar) and participles for most
verbs also incorporate the relevant Thematic Suffix (in some cases in a
reduced guise), and, since Series III for monopersonal Intransitives is
formed from the Past Participle whilst that for bipersonal Intransitives is
formed from the Masdar, Thematic Suffixes are widely attested in Series
III for Intransitive (including Indirect and Stative) verbs. Two of the
Thematic Suffixes (with exceptions) even occur in Series 11. For these
reasons I judge the alternative names given above for these formants too
restrictive.
    The Thematic Suffixes in use today with Transitive Verbs are: -eb,
-ob, -av, -am, -ev, -en, and -i. Those in this list are widely used; in
addition one can point to: (a) -em, found in parts of the paradigm for the
root 'give' (viz. Future mi-(0-0-)s-c-em PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)3rd.PER-
give-TS(FUT) 'you will give X/them to Y/them' vs the equivalent Aorist mi-
(Ø-Ø-Ø-)e-c-i PREV-(you-3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)IOV-give-AORJNDIC                 'you
gave X/them to Y/them'); (b) -op, found with the root for 'divide' (viz. ga-
(Ø-Ø-)q'-op PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)divide-TS(FUT) 'you will divide X/them'
vs Aorist ga-(Ø-Ø-)q'av-i 'you divided X/them')—this suffix also turns up
in part of the paradigm of the copula (e.g. the past participle q'-op-il-i
'having been, ex-' and the masdar q'-op-n-a 'being').
    Whilst theGEORGIANmasdar does not normally distinguish active
(transitive) from passive (intransitive), there are a number of roots which
do possess their own passive/intransitive masdars. In these masdars one
finds the element -om occupying the slot normally taken by the Thematic
Suffix (i.e. between root and masdar-exponent -a). Consider the following:
(a-)(Ø-)dg-eb-i 'you (will) stand up' => vs a-dg-om-a 'standing up' (cf.
dg-om-a 'standing'), (mo-)(Ø-)k'vd-eb-i 'you (will) die' => (mo-)k'vd-om-
a 'dying'18, (Ø-)xt'-i 'you jump' => xt'-om-a 'jumping', (ga-)t'q'd-eb-a 'X
(will) break(s)' => (ga-)t'q'd-om-a 'breaking (intrans.)' vs (ga-)(0-0-)t'ex
'you (will) break X/them' => (ga-)t'ex-a 'breaking (trans.)', (mo-)(0-0-)a-
xd-en 'you (will) effect X/them' => (mo-)xd-en-a 'effecting' vs (mo-)xd-
eb-a 'it (will) happen(s)' => (mo-)xd-om-a 'happening'. With this last it is
interesting to compare the verb-form ( g a - ) ( 0 - 0 - 0 - ) x d - i (N.B. the
144                          GEORGIANGRAMMARdifferent Thematic Suffix as well as the structural analysis) (Prev-)(you-
3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)strip-TS 'you (will) remove article(s) of clothing X from
Y/them', for which the masdar is (ga-)xd-a 'undressing', whereas we have
the intransitive form (ga-)(Ø-)xd-eb-i 'you (will) become X; you (will)
grow thin', for which the masdar is (ga-)xd-om-a. However, for the
former meaning of this verb-form there exists the transitive (ga-)(0-
0 - ) x d - i 'you (will) render X/them Y' (e.g. u+en+o-s     ga-g-xd-i-s
speechless-DAT PREV-you-render-X(FUT) 'X will render you speechless').
Yet it would seem that in this instance the Masdar in -om is also used
transitively—KEGl quotes this example for C'avč'avadze:      še+i+jl+eb+a st'umar-i jm-ad                mi-(Ø-)i-tvis-o-s

      'It's possible for a man to accept a guest as a brother, but, as for
      making him (his) master, he will die and (still) not deign to do this'     In the case of šr-om-a the word is viewed today more as an abstract-
noun 'work(ing)' than as the Masdar of (Ø-Ø-)š'vr-eb-i 'you do X'.
     There are a few verbs that employ in places the seeming Thematic
Suffix -ol (e.g. kar-i kr-i-s 'the wind blows' => kr-ol-a 'blowing' and cf.
the Future kar-i i-kr-ol-eb-s 'the wind will blow'; g-q'+av-s 'you have
animate X/them' => q'-ol-a 'having (something animate)' and cf. the Future
g-e-q'-ol-eb-a 'you will have animate X/them'; (Ø-Ø-)i-svr-i 'you hurl
X/them' => sr-ol-a 'throwing' and cf. the Future (Ø-Ø-)i-sr-ol-eb 'you
will hurl X/them'; (da-)(Ø-)c'v-eb-i 'you (will) lie down' => da-c'-ol-a
'lying down' (cf. c'-ol-a 'lying')).
     Another suffix that might be regarded as (at least akin to) a Thematic
Suffix is -il, but this too today has more of the force of an abstract-noun
formant—it is particularly common with Stative verbs, and sometimes it
combines with the prefix si- (e.g. tav-i g-t'k'iv-a head-NOM you-pain-it
'your head aches' => t'k'iv-il-i '(being in) pain', (Ø-)dum-x-a+r you-
be.silent-you-be 'you are silent' => dum-il-i '(being in) silence', (Ø-)k'vd-
eb-i 'you die' => si-k'vd-il-i 'death', (Ø-)i-rb-en 'you will run' => either
si-rb-il-i or rb-en-a 1 9 , g-ši-a 'you are hungry' => ši-mš-il-i <= *si-ms-
il-i, for the bilabial nasal cf. mš-ier-i 'hungry' and (Ø-Ø-)a-mš-ev 'you
                             VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                            145make X/them hungry'). In a few verbs the suffix -il seems to correlate
with -in in other parts of the paradigm (e.g. j(-)il-i 'sleep' vs g-j(-)in-
av-s 'you are asleep', korc'(-)il-i 'wedding-feast' vs da-korc'(-)in-d-
nen 'they got married' and gan-korc'(-)in-d-nen 'they got divorced').
     The Thematic Suffix -i is clearly the exception in terms of its
structure, as well as being the one which is not carried over into the
Perfect. However, at first glance it may seem that this latter statement is
not correct (cf. ga-g-zrd-i-s PREV-you-rear-TS-X          'X will rear you',
which gives the Perfect ga-(Ø-)u-zrd-i-x-a+r 'X apparently (has) reared
you', where we still have an i-vowel immediately after the root. However,
this is no longer the Thematic Suffix but a Perfect-exponent, as we see if
we take any Transitive Perfect formed from roots coupled either with no
Thematic Suffix or any Thematic Suffix other than -av or -am in Series I
(e.g. for the Root Verb (da-)(0-0-)c'er 'you (will) write X/them' we have
the Perfect da-g-i-c'er-i-a 'you apparently wrote/have written X/them',
whilst for (ga-)(0-0-)a-k'et-eb 'you (will) do/make X/them' we have the
Perfect ga-g-i-k'et-eb-i-a 'you apparently (have) made X/them').
     Of the Thematic Suffixes listed above -eb, or, more restrictedly, -ob
and -ev are also found in Series I screeves as part of the morphology of
Intransitive verbs—as indeed is the bilabial element of -am and the labio­
dental for some verbs in -av.
     As to the original function of the Thematic Suffixes, the best
explanation so far advanced is that of Aronson (1979). To anticipate what
is made explicit in Chapter 5, a comparison of the syntax of Transitive and
Intransitive verbal classes for Series I screeves reveals that we are
dealing with a Nominative-Accusative configuration (the Nominative case
marks the subject of both Transitive and Intransitive Verbs, whilst the
direct object is marked differently, viz. by the Dative case). In Series II,
however, we have an Ergative-Absolutive alignment (transitive subjects
standing in the Ergative case, whilst intransitive subjects and direct objects
stand in the Nominative(-Absolutive)). The Dative case is, of course, also
used to mark the indirect object with the majority of finite verb-forms, and
the at first glance surprising fact that the Dative also marks the direct
object for Transitive Verbs in Series I screeves could be straightforwardly
explained, if in origin the relevant argument functioned as an indirect
object of what at the time would have been a bivalent intransitive verb-
form. Aronson illustrated an instance in OldGEORGIANwhere what today
would be regarded as a simple Dative direct object was evidently
interpreted as an indirect object thereby occasioning the Set B agreement-
prefix s- in the verb-form (namely:

      'they were defending the gates')    Taking, as commentators generally do, Series 11 with its ergative-
alignment to be basic in the language, Aronson suggested that what today
are clearly independently existing Series I transitive screeves with their
own restructured tense, and aspectual (sc. imperfective vs perfective)
oppositions (not to mention the active-passive dichotomy) were in origin all
derived intransitive, imperfective forms produced from the fundamental,
ergatively aligned Series 11 base-forms by an anti-passive transformation,
whose morphological markers were none other than today's Thematic
Suffixes. Series I direct objects were, thus, in origin indirect objects and
were naturally marked by the Dative; this case has simply continued to
mark the relevant entity, now reinterpreted as a direct object.
    A given root will normally be used for a given meaning always with the
same Thematic Suffix, even though it sometimes happens that dialects
employ for a given root a Thematic Suffix different from the one generally
in use, and Root Verbs are sometimes assigned a Thematic Suffix, often
-av (e.g. for (Ø-Ø-)t'ex 'you break X/them' one may meet (Ø-Ø-)t'ex-
av). However, we have already given one example where the suffix -av
was replaced by -eb when an indirect object governed by the locative
Versional vowel a- was associated with the root in question. Two parallel
examples would be (še-)(0-0-)k'er-av (PREV-)(you-3rd.PER-)sew-TS 'you

148                        GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.3 Preverbs       (zmn+is+c'in+eb+i)In origin the preverbs were independently standing adverbial elements
which indicated directionality and/or orientation (sc. movement towards or
away from the speaker). Comparison of a case like postposition -gan 'from'
vs preverb ga(n)- 'out of' reveals a clear bifurcation in the development of
one such hypothesised adverbial as it solidified in the former instance with
a noun and in the latter instance with a verb (cf. postposition -Si 'in(to)' and
preverb še- 'in(to)'). Further evidence for the original independent status
of these elements comes both from the frequent examples of so-called
tmesis in OldGEORGIANtexts and from the behaviour of some of the
preverbs in modern Svan.
    The original directional-orientational force of the preverbs is
preserved when they are combined with roots expressing motion. Starting
with the two preverbs of orientation, mi- and mo-, the prešent-day list of
preverbs is as follows:      Simplex                                       Complex

      da-                 down                      [da-mo-]    N.B. the older alternative forms with bracketed material are not in free
variation with their shorter variants, and their use will be described
separately below.
    We can start by illustrating their usage in association with the basic
root of motion for the Prešent Indicative—for the conjugation of this verb
see 4.10. The forms below are given with 3rd person singular subject:      mi-di-s                  X is going
      mi-mo-di-s               X is coming & going
      mo-di-s                  X is coming
      a-di-s                   X is going up
      a-mo-di-s                X is coming up
      g a-di-s                 X is going out
                            VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                            149   ga-mo-di-s                 X is coming out
   gada-di-s                  X is going over/across/through
   gad-mo-di-s                X is coming over/across/through
   še-di-s                    X is going in
   še-mo-di-s                 X is coming in
   ča-di-s                    X is going down (into)
   ča-mo-di-s                 X is coming down (into)
   da-di-s                    X goes regularly; X goes down    Today mi- indicates 'thither', which is interpreted as orientation away
from either speaker or hearer (hence the translation 'go'), whereas m o -
indicates 'hither', which is orientation towards either speaker or hearer (or
towards a 3rd person who is in the vicinity of speaker or hearer—hence
'come'). In OldGEORGIANmo- was associated exclusively with the speaker,
so that, whereas today one can only say šen-tan mo-di-s 'X is coming to
your place', the equivalent in OldGEORGIANwould have been šen-tan mi-
di-s. Where a verbal root implies movement, if that root has as its
preverb mi- when the movement is towards a 3rd person indirect object,
then the preverbal slot will be taken by mo- for movement towards 1st or
2nd person (e.g. mi-v-(Ø-Ø-)e-c-i 'I gave X/them to Y/them' vs m o -
(Ø-)g-e-c-i = OldGEORGIANmi-(Ø-)g-e-c-i 'I gave X/them to you' vs
mo-(Ø-Ø-)gv-e-c-i 'you gave X/them to us'; mi-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)mart-e 'you
addressed yourself to X/them' vs mo-(?Ø-)g-mart-es 'they addressed
themselves to you/you(PD' vs mo-(Ø-?Ø-)m-mart-e-t 'you(Pl) addressed
yourselves to me'2Ø).
    Association of the two orientational preverbs in the order given
indicates movement in both directions (i.e. 'to and fro', 'back and forth').
An example would be mi-mo-di-s tav+is otax-ši 'X is pacing back and
forth/up and down in his/her own room'. Such a coupling can often be
alternatively expressed by a special reduplication consisting of m i - plus
relevant components of the verbal complex upto (usually) the end of the
root followed by (and hyphenated if written) the same sequence but with
mo- plus all appropriate inflexional material after the root (e.g. mi-mo-i-
xed-av-s = mi-i-xed=mo-i-xed-av-s 'X will look this way and that' 21 ;
and mi-mo-(Ø-)a-c , q'd-eb-a = mi-(Ø-)a-c , q'd=mo-(Ø-)a-c'q'd-eb-a
'X will crash into Y this way and that'). However, to judge by the relatively
few examples quoted in KEGl, in the case of the basic verb of motion
reduplication with these two orientational preverbs may imply movement
over a greater distance than is achievable in a single room, e.g.

      man-NOM woman-NOM
      'men (and) women are coming and going to (sc. and from) the vineyard'    This type of reduplication is not of course limited to the two preverbs
illustrated so far—for example, the normal preverb for the root - c ' o n -
'weigh' is a-, but to indicate a very serious consideration of a matter we
can combine this with da-, whose original directional force was the
opposite to that of a-, to give:      a-(Ø-)c'on=da-(Ø-)c'on-es
      PREV-(3rd.PER-)weigh-PREV-(3rd.PER-)weigh-they(AOR)
      'they weighed X/them up and down'    Coupling of m o - with itself would be illogical, as one cannot have
hither-orientation of 'hither', but for the other preverbs abšence of m i -
implies thither-orientation, whilst the addition of mo- as second component
lends the basic directionality a hither-orientation, which explains the
translations appended to the examples listed above.
    The original force of da- was 'down', and this is still prešent in such
verbs as da-(?0-)e-c-a or da-vard-a 'X fell down'. However, with the
verb of motion the meaning 'go down' is rather restricted, KEGl giving just
the one example for the subject 'temperature', viz.      t'emp'erat'ura     gam-it     zog-jer       nul-a-mde       da-di-s
      temperature(NOM) night-INST some-times null-ADV-upto        PREV-fall-X
      'sometimes by night the temperature falls/sinks to zero'    With this šense the verb has the regular paradigm for the verb of
motion (viz. 3rd person Future da-va 2 3 , Aorist da-vid-a, Perfect d a - s -
ul-a). However, da-di-s more usually has the šense of 'go on a regular
basis', which contrasts with mi-di-s 'X goes/is going NOW' and m i - m o -
di-s 'X is going to and fro NOW' (e.g. sk'ola-ši da-di-s velosip'ed-it 'X

   'boats (regularly) journey between Poti and Odessa')    For this šense the verb resorts to (transitive but preverbless!)
suppletive forms outside the Prešent Sub-Series (viz. 3rd person Future

Pluperfect (ma-s) e-vl-o—see 4.10).
    For the coupling da-mo- Shanidze (1976.71) quotes an OldGEORGIAN
example from Acts (possibly 9:39) where the šense is 'down hither', viz.   da-mo-s-di-od-es                                nak'adul-n-i

   'streams of tears were pouring down them'but in ModernGEORGIANthe coupling is found with only one verb root, and
even here it is restricted to the relevant Past and Privative Participles (viz.
da-mo-k'id-eb-ul-i 'dependent', da-mo-u-k'id-eb-el-i 'independent')
and their derivatives (viz. da-mo-k'id-eb-ul-eba 'dependence', da-mo-
u-k'id-eb-1-oba 'independence').
    For the šense of 'X is going down' ča-di-s is used (e.g lipt'-it a-di-
x-a+r tu ča-di-x-a+r? 'Are you going up or down with the lift?'), in
addition to retaining its original force of 'down into' (e.g. magaro-ši ča-v-
di-v-a+r 'I'm going down (into) the mine'), which is explained by the
preverb's etymology (c'a- <= š-ta- <= *še-da-). The intermediate stage in
the development is retained in such forms as š+ta+gon+eb+a 'inspiration',
whereas the Masdar of this cognate verb today is ča-gon-eb-a 'putting a
thought in someone's mind'. This preverb is also used with the verb of
motion to signify 'alight from a car/train/bus' (e.g. ča-v-di-v-a+r, ga-
(Ø-)m-a-t'ar-e! 'I'm getting off, let me pass/off/through!') or 'go
somewhere (covering a large distance, as between two towns)'.               If
orientation is towards speaker or addressee in these cases, the complex
da-mo- will naturally be used (e.g. dge-s vin ča-mo-di-s mosk'ov-
i+dan? 'Who is coming from Moscow today?').
    In addition to being used for the direction 'into from outside', the
preverb še- is used in contexts of signifying 'up onto' (e.g. da-jd-a 'X sat
down' with da- vs še-jd-a cxen-ze/xe-ze 'X sat on the horse/tree' with
še-).
152                        GEORGIANGRAMMAR    On p. 17 of S. Mak'alatia's History and Ethnography of Mingrelia we find
in virtually identical contexts the Past Participle meaning 'preserved', and
yet in one case še- alone is used, whilst in the other we have še-mo-, viz.     mcire      cn+ob-eb-i-a       jvel berjn+ul m+c'er+l+oba-ši

    No example was offered above for the preverbs c ' a - / c ' a - m o - , c'a-
basically indicating 'forward' (cf. c'in 'in front, before, ahead'), in the
Prešent of the verb of motion. This is because such couplings are not
possible in the Prešent Sub-Series. However, elsewhere in the paradigm
these preverbs do come into play, and the question arises as to how one
differentiates between, say, the Futures c'a-va and rni-va, both signifying
'X will go'. The answer is that c'a- emphasises the departure and
journeying, whilst mi- implies reaching the destination (e.g. bič'-i c'a-va
sk'ola-ši 'the lad will go to school' vs bič'-i mi-va buxar-tan 'the lad
will go upto the stove'). The same interplay is observed with the verb for
'take'—in the Prešent Sub-Series only mi- is possible, e.g.      eg c'ign-i       sad      mi-g-a-kv-s?
      that book-NOM where? PREV-you-lV-take-it
      'Where are you taking that book?'whereas elsewhere the same nuances as just described attach to the
preverbs mi- and c'a-, e.g.      malamo          tan    c'a-(Ø-Ø-)-t'an-e! (= c'a-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e!)

'away' towards or with speaker or hearer (e.g. mo-(Ø-)di a+k! 'come

   'Hold on, we'll come along too')    From their original role as markers of directionality/orientation the
preverbs took on the function of marking perfective aspect with the result
that today for the bulk of verbs in the Transitive and Intransitive classes
the relevant preverb will usually be prešent in screeves other than those
of the Prešent Sub-Series. The addition of the appropriate (and usually
unpredictable) preverb to the Prešent Indicative of most Transitive or
Intransitive verbs produces the Future Indicative (e.g. (Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s
'X does/makes Y/them' => ga-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s 'X will do/make Y/them').
 In OldGEORGIANthere was no independent Future Indicative screeve, the
Prešent or Aorist Subjunctive as appropriate (sc. according to aspect)
making up the deficiency. The association of root with preverb can then
come to play a lexical role, for by altering the preverb from ga- to še-
with the root -k'et- we produce a verb-form with the lexical meaning
'repair' (e.g. ro+di+s še-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-en a+m t'elevizor-s? 'When
will they repair this television?'), the preverbless Prešent (Sub-Series) forms
being ambiguous out of context for the meanings 'do/make' vs 'repair'.
Another example would be the verb 'kill' which normally takes the preverb
m o - (e.g. bič'-ma baq'aq'-i mo-(Ø-)k'l-a 'the lad killed the frog'), but if
the killing is with a knife (typically of an animal slaughtered in ritualistic
sacrifice or for preparation as food), then the preverb da- takes over, e.g.   dia+saxl+is-ma katam-i              da-(Ø-)k'l-a               da

   'the housewife killed the chicken (sc. by slitting its throat) and fed it to

the range of couplings well illustrates the way the inter-dependencies of

The reason for the choice of preverb in most of the examples in the
previous paragraph is, I think, opaque—synonymous roots can be found
which, despite their parallel semantics, take different preverbs (e.g. da-s-
cin-eb = ga-kird-av 'you will mock X'). Sometimes, the change can be
explained in terms of the original directional force of the preverb and the
basic lexical meaning of the root is little altered. The normal preverb for
-ngr- 'ruin' is da-, e.g.      revolucia-m       da-(Ø-)a-ngr-i-a             sa+zizg+ar-i

Depending on whether one wants the neutral, potential or prohibitional
pronouns one has a respective choice of ara-vin, vera-vin, nura-vin
for 'no-one', or again for 'no longer anybody' the choice is a-gara-vin,
ve-gara-vin, nu-gara-vin; the declensions follow that of vin? above.
The parallel choices for 'nothing'/'no longer anything' are ara-per-i/a-
gara-per-i, vera-per-i/ve-gara-per-i, nura-per-i/nu-gara-per-i
respectively; these decline like any syncopating consonant-final noun.
    An older alternative to ara-per-i is ara-ra, or just ara. An example
of this last would be: ara-s (= ara-per-s (ar)) v-i-t'q'v-i 'I shall say
nothing'. The longer of the alternatives is today usually only found when
its constituent parts are split by the verb, as in the traditional start to
fairy-tales (viz. i-q'+o da ara i-q'+o ra 'there was and there was
nothing' = 'once upon a time'). For the potential equivalent vera in the
phrase vera-s ga-(Ø-?Ø-)xd-eb-i 'you won't be able to achieve
anything' cf. mag kad+il-it vera-s ga-(Ø-?Ø-)xd-eb-i-t, bič'-eb-o
'with that impudence you won't manage to achieve anything, lads'.","[99, 100]"
"4.8.2 The Causative for Medial Verbs
The Causative of Medials is simply the b a š f o r m with a-versioniser which
in its Subjective Version provides the Medial with its Future Sub-Series and
Series 11 screeves (Series 111 then being formed, as one would expect from
these, esšentially Transitive Verb-forms, by inversion and other
appropriate adaptations). Such (pseudo-)Causatives share with the Medial
the feature that even in the normally perfective screeves no preverb is
used. And so, we have such correspondence-sets as the following:
(Ø-)cek'v-av 'you dance' => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-cek , v-eb vs (Ø-Ø-)a-
cek'v-eb 'you (will) get X/them to dance'; (Ø-)t'ir-i 'you cry' => Future
(Ø-?Ø-)i-t'ir-eb vs (Ø-Ø-)a-t'ir-eb 'you (will) make X/them cry'; (Ø-)
nadir-ob 'you hunt' => Future (Ø-?Ø-}i-nadir-eb vs (Ø-Ø-) a-nadir-eb
'you (will) get X/them to hunt'; (Ø-)i-brjv-i 'you fight' => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-
brj+ol-eb vs (Ø-Ø-)a-brj+ol-eb 'you (will) get X/them to fight'; (Ø-)
cxovr-ob 'you live' => (Ø-?Ø-)i-cxovr-eb vs (Ø-Ø-)a-cxovr-eb 'you
(will) give X/them the means to live'; (cecxl-i) guzguz-eb-s '(the fire)
crackles/roars' => Future (?Ø-)i-guzguz-eb-s vs (cecxl-s) (Ø-Ø-)a-
guzguz-eb 'you (will) make (the fire) crackle/roar'; (jroxa) zmu-i-s '(the
cow) mood' => Future ( ? Ø - ) i - z m u + v l - e b - s vs (jroxa-s) (Ø-Ø-)a-
zmu+vl-eb 'you (will) make (the cow) moo'; (rje) dug-s '(the milk) boils' =>
Future (?Ø-)i-dug-eb-s vs (rje-s) (Ø-Ø-)a-dug-eb 'you (will) boil (the
418                             GEORGIANGRAMMARmilk)'. In Series III, whilst the Medials incorporate no Thematic Suffix -eb
but often do insert the element -n-, the corresponding (pseudo-)Causatives
do incorporate the Thematic Suffix -eb and form the three screeves of
this Series as one would expect—for example: Perfect cecxl-i g-i-
guzguz-eb-i-a 'you apparently made the fire crackle/roar' vs Pluperfect
cecxl-i g-e-guzguz-eb-in-a vs III rd Subjunctive cecxl-i g-e-
guzguz-eb-in-o-s. Note how screeves differ for the verbs 'learn' and
'teach': (Ø-(Ø-))sc'avl-ob 'you learn (X/them)' => Future (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avl-
i165 => Aorist (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avl-e => Perfect g-i-sc'avl-i-a => Pluperfect g-
e - s c ' a v l - a => III rd Subjunctive g - e - s c ' a v l - o - s vs ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) a -
sc'avl-i 'you (will) teach X/them to Y/them' 1 6 6 => Aorist ( Ø - Ø -
Ø-)a-sc'avl-e => Perfect g-i-sc'avl-eb-i-a -tvis => Pluperfect g - e -
sc'avl-eb-in-a -tvis => III rd Subjunctive g-e-sc'avl-eb-in-o-s -tvis;
in the perfective screeves of both 'learn' and 'teach' either of the preverbs
š e - / d a - may in fact be used, presumably when the nuance is of a full
acquisition of knowledge.
      From (Ø-Ø-)xmar-ob 'you use X/them' (Future (Ø-Ø-)i-xmar-eb; cf.
(da-/mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xmar-eb-i 'you (will) help X/them' 1 6 7 ) we have
(da-/mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xmar(-eb) 'you (will) use X/themDO for the
benefit of/to assist Y/themI O', where we note the optionality of employing
the Thematic Suffix -eb in Series I (cf. the synonyms (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-
Ø-)a-švel-eb from             (Ø-Ø-)švel-i/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-švel-i            'you (will) aid
X/them' and (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-s'vel-eb-i 'you (will) come/go to the
assistance of X/them'). Cf. (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-švel+i-eb = (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-
xmar-eb 'you (will) bring in X/them in aid; make advantageous use of
X/them'.
      There are, however, some exceptions to this, as shewn by the following:
(Ø-Ø-)varaud-ob 'you suppose X/them' => Future (Ø-Ø-)i-varaud-eb vs
(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-varaud-eb-in-eb 'you (will) cause X/them to suppose
Y/them'; (Ø-Ø-)grjn-ob 'you feel X' => Future (Ø-Ø-)i-grjn-ob vs (Ø-Ø-
Ø-)a-grjn-ob-in-eb 'you (will) cause X/them to feel Y', e.g.      ek'onomik'+ur-ma  ga+sa+č'ir-ma                  sa+m+š+ob+l+o-ši
