"This usually occurs as an answer to a question (see the question in (122a)and its answer in (122b). The reply takes the certainty marker 'kV-' inorder to assert the occurrence of an action plus the subject pronominal
markers which follow it.
(122)
      ( a) a-diik-ŋaŋ     i-cuuk?           2sg-go-2sg    DIR-market

   ( b) ki-n-diik-dʌ         MM-1sg-go-1sg

The full paradigm in (123) shows the different forms of the Timacertainty marker 'kV-' with regard to the person markers (see also table4.3).",[231]
"
Dimmendaal and Gilley prepared, but have not yet published, some
phonological notes on Tima such as the distribution of consonants and
vowels with some minimal pair examples, the syllable structure of Tima
words with many questions on tones and the ATR system remaining
unclarified. The main purpose behind this phonology write-up was the
development of an orthographic system for the Tima language 2 . The most
recent source for the Tima language is found in unpublished field notes
collected by Dimmendaal in 2004 which is now considered as a basic
source for the current researches on Tima (see Dimmendaal, 2009).",[30]
"The majority of Tima verbs take this suffix. The appearance of this suffixincreases the valency of the verb in question. The '-i' suffix is considered
                                    212
as a derivational marker that adds meaning to a verb root. But it can notbe separated from the root. In other words, the occurrence of this suffix '-i' is obligatory. Therefore, the whole verb form in this case is consideredas a stem which constitutes a root plus derivational suffix '-i'. The suffixvowel is harmonized with the root vowel, either ± ATR. The examples of
transitive verbs are in (124):
(124)
a) mur-i                   'pick (it) off'
b) kɪlɪŋ-ɪ                 'take over (somebody)' (the story of Horse quarrel)
c) kuruh-i                 'push (it)'
d) dah-ɪ                   'say (it)'
e) hada-y-ɪ                'jump over (it)'
f) pu-y-i                  'shoot (it)'
There is an epenthetic glide '-y-' in example (124e and f). This is due tothe fact that these verbs end with a vowel, consequently the glide occursin order to separate the final-root vowel and the transitive suffix 'ɪ-/i-'.","[233, 234]"
"
The examples in (91) show that the numerals follow the nouns they
modify. Thus, the rule is:
NP → N + NumRegarding the ordinal numbers, they also follow the head noun which
they modify. For example:
(92) Ø-wartamadɘh             kɪ-ɲɛr     Nc.sg-man               REL-first
     '(the) first man'
                                         117
The ordinal number 'kɪɲɛr', 'first' also has the same form when it modifiesplural nouns in an NP. But there is an additional marker 'Vŋ' (literallymeaning ‘by’; i.e. it is actually an instrumental marker in Tima)
appearing before the number. In such cases, the plural referents are
treated as one unit as in (93).
(93) ɪ-wɘrtmadɘh-na                  ɪŋ-kɪɲɛr-ɪ          an-cu-uŋ       NC.Pl-man-Dem                 INST-first-FOC    ASP.3sg-arrive-Ven
       'the first men arrived'The ordinal number 'kɪ-ɲɛr' has another plural form 'ɲ-iɲɛr' when thehead noun (referents) is treated as separate units as in (94).
(94) ɪ-wɘrmadɘh-na               ɲ-iɲɛr-ɪ             an-cʊ-ʊŋ       NC.Pl-man-Dem               INST-first-FOC     ASP.3sg-arrive-Ven
       'the first men arrived'
Numerals can be used elliptically without a head noun, (especially in a
response to a question) for example:
(95)
a) a-tɪɪn                 diy-ʌŋ  STAT.sg-one            came-Ven
  'one came'
                                            118
b) ɪ-hɪɪk                diy-ʌŋ  NC.Pl-two              came-Ven
  'two came'
The Tima numerals are similar to nouns in that they can be inflected for
case markers. There are two possibilities for analyzing the form of the
number with the nasal element below. The examples in (96) show that thenumber is inflected either for the instrumental marker '(V)ŋ-', 'by/with'and at the same time it follows the noun which it modifies or by the
ergative marker in Tima N. Such a case usually occurs when the focus of
attention is on the number (this is the same nasal sound N which appears
in ergative case with pronouns and other elements in a sentence, see
4.3.2).
(96)
a) kwana    ŋ-kɪtɪɪn              'with/by one cow'b) yana        ɲ-ɪhɪɪk            'with/by two cows'The form of the inflected number for the instrumental marker usually
appears in the case of focusing on number and not on the action as in (97
a). But if the focus is on the action the instrumental marker disappears
from the number and instead the verb which described the action takes an
ergative case marker (an enclitic ergative pronoun). Compare the
examples in (97b) below.","[138, 139, 140]"
"
4.6.1 Negative declarativeThe negation of declarative clauses involves a denial of intransitive,
transitive and ditransitive clauses or predications. All of these declarative
types are negated by two negative particles in the clause: the negativeparticle 'kV-', which is procliticised to a verb; it occurs in slot 1 in Table4.1, and the negative particle '-Vŋ' which is encliticised to a verb or verbphrase; it occurs in slot 12 in Table 4.1 in case of intransitive verbs, and
the final position of a clause in case of transitive clauses. Therefore, the
former is considered as a particle which negates the whole clause. Theproclitic negative marker 'kV-' always fuses with the pronominal markersin slot 3 in Table 4.1. The following examples illustrate negation with a
negative verb contrasting positive verb forms with negative ones.",[276]
"This name is used by other inhabitants of the Nuba Mountains including
Arabic communities without carrying any negative connotation to its
native speakers and it is widely used in the literature, i.e. this language
name is well known to the outsiders and linguists. Tima people refer to
                                     3
their language as 'du-murik'. It also has several alternative names used by
others neighboring groups when referring to Tima speakers, such as:
Lomoriki, Tamanik, and Yibwa (Grimes, 1984).","[24, 25]"
"
Mood ('modality', or 'mode') is another important category of a verb. It is
defined by Crystal (1991: 223) as ""a grammatical category through which
the speakers of a language can indicate whether they believe that an event
or state actually occurs, does not occur, or has the potential to occur"".
Traditionally, grammarians and linguists categorize a sentence into major
types based on mood. These types are: indicative, imperative,
subjunctive, and interrogative mood. These categories may be signaled by
alternative inflectional forms of the verb. For example, in Alaaba (a
Cushitic language spoken in Ethiopia) mood is marked morphologically
on verbs especially in the case of directive and optative, while the
indicative mood is unmarked (Schneider-Blum, 2007).          On the other
hand, mood may be marked by using auxiliaries as the case in English.",[59]
"
4.4.3.1 The imperative mood
The imperative mood is used to give a direct command to addressee(s)
(Fromkin, 2005). In Tima, the positive imperative form of verbs is                                     205
considered as a stem rather than a verb root. That is, the imperative often
takes different suffixes which provide an additional meaning to the root.
These suffixes are considered as derivational suffixes and the meaning of
verbs can not be completed without the appearance of those suffixes (see
section (4.5).","[226, 227]"
"
Tima has two obligatory negative particles that appear in a negative
sentence: The negative proclitic marker 'kV-' and the negative enclitic
marker '-Vŋ'. In this respect, Tima resembles Hausa, a Chadic language
(Kraft and Kraft, 1973) and Gur (Niger- Congo) languages (Watters,
2000) in using double negative particles which are external to the verb
word. Consequently, Tima in most cases displays the following negative
pattern: (S) NEG-SM-V root-(O)-NEG (see 4.6).",[61]
"
If the imperative verb stem takes a direct object (i.e. if it is a transitive
verb), the second enclitic negative marker is encliticized to the end of the
clause. That is, it negates the whole clause as in (179).",[279]
"
In Tima, the positive imperative mood is unmarked for person in the case
of 2nd person singular; i.e. it does not take any personal prefix as the
subjunctive mood type does. In the case of 2nd person plural it is markedby the prefix 'na-' which is very productive in the language. It is foundthat in the case of the negative imperative mood for the 2nd personsingular that the form is marked by the prefix 'a-' which occurs after thenegative proclitic 'kV-'. In this case the imperative form is classified as ahortative form/mood (weak imperative/command, see 4.6 on verbal
negation).",[227]
"                                           254
In Section 4.6.1 the negative constructions of declarative sentence type
will be presented. The negative construction of the imperative,
subjunctive and veridical mood will be shown in 4.6.2. The negation of
perfective and imperfective verb forms will be described and discussed in
Section 4.6.3.","[275, 276]"
"
The chapter concluded by presenting the two different strategies of verbalnegation: (i) with the negative proclitic 'kV-' and the negative enclitic'Vŋ'and (ii) with the negative expression 'amaŋ'. It is found that Tima has a
                                    314
common strategy of negating declarative sentences, which is the first one
mentioned above. Moreover, the form of negated sentences depends on
the aspect distinction, e.g. whether it is perfective or imperfective. In thelatter, the negation-marking expression 'amaŋ' is used.","[335, 336]"

2.4.1.3 Negation
Sometimes, negation is considered as a mood type in contrast with
imperative and interrogative sentence type. But here the negation is taken
as a verbal inflection which modifies the verb and the verb phrase. This
leads us to distinguish between two types and strategies of sentence
negation as found in African languages. The first type is an internal
negation of the verb word which is common in African languages. This
usually involves affixes either before or after the verb word. An example
of this strategy is found in Aghem, a Benue-Congo (Niger-Congo)
language (Anderson, 1979), and in Labala, a Bantu (Niger-Congo)
language (David Morgan, p.c.). The second type is an external negation
of the verb word. That is, negative particles occur in clause-final position
and it negates the whole clause or sentence. In the case of transitive
verbs, the negative particle occurs after the object. This type is found in
Chadic languages in Nigeria and Cameroon (Creissels, 2008).","[60, 61]"
"
All tenses (future vs. non-future) of verbs are negated simply by addingthe two negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ'. See the examples above.",[278]
"
I would like to express my gratitude to my co-supervisor Prof. Gerrit
Dimmenaal who patiently provided me with the advice and guidance
without which this work could not have been presented in this final form.",[13]
"
15
  Punctual verbs always contrast with durative/progressive term which usually involves an extended
period of time (Lyons, 1968).",[221]
"4.6.2 Negative imperative, subjunctive and veridical moodIn most cases, the imperative, subjunctive and veridical clauses in Tima
are negated in the same way as the negation of declarative clauses, i.e. bythe particle 'kV' and 'Vŋ'. The examples in 178 and 179 show how the                                      257
imperative negation is being applied to the 2sg, 2pl and the subjunctive
weak form in the case of 1pl inclusive. The negative particles areunderlined in the examples below. Concerning the negative particle 'kV',here they are variable with regard to the person and number and they are
changed according to the vowel harmony of the verb root (Bashir
forthcoming).","[278, 279]"
"
2.4.1 Verb structure
Usually, the verb consists of a number of morphemes which express
different grammatical categories plus the verb root. The output verb form
is referred to as a verb stem. For instance, the English verb 'look' is
considered as a verb root where the verb 'look' plus the '-ed' past marker
form the verb stem 'looked'. The order of morphemes in the verb differs
from one language to another. Some of them appear either as prefixes/
suffixes or as infixes. If one looks at Swahili verb structure (an SVO
language), different slots are occupied by different morphological
categories,   for   example,    subject   agreement-Tense/Aspect-(object
agreement)-verb root-(derivational suffixes)-mood vowel. Tima verb
structure is much more complicated than the Swahili verb structure. The
Tima verb, in its most complex form, contains more than ten slots
expressing different grammatical categories, such as the following:
(negative marker) - aspect marker - proclitic subject marker – tense - verb
root - (derivational suffixes) - (object marker) - enclitic subject marker -
(negative marker) (see 4.2 on the verb as a word structure). These various
slots on the verb express different types of inherent grammatical
categories associated with the verb such as subject/object marker (i.e.
person markers), TAM, derivational affixes. These grammatical                                    35
categories of the verb will be discussed below with reference to their
occurrence mainly in African languages.","[56, 57]"

follows:
NEG + IMP/SUBJ (O) + NEG
With regard to the negation of veridical clauses, it has been mentioned inSection (4.4.3.4) that the verdical marker in Tima is 'kV-', thereforehaplology (see section 2.2.1.3) as a phonological process takes placewhen negating these clauses. That is, the proclitic negative marker 'kV-' isdropped because of its similarity with the veridical marker 'kV-', whilethe enclitic negative marker '-Vŋ' occurs. The examples are in (180)below.

4.6.3 Perfective and imperfective negation
Tima uses the two negative strategies mentioned above. In the case ofperfective situation the common negative strategy ('kV-' and '-Vŋ'particles) is used as in (180). Alternatively, in the case of imperfectivesituations the quantifier 'amaŋ' is used as in (181). This form consists ofthe stative marker 'a-' plus 'maŋ' which means 'it is nothing'. But actuallythe form 'maŋ' has no meaning by itself; see the examples below.","[279, 280, 281]"
"
3.2.1 Adjectives
The traditional definition of adjectives identifies them as the class of
words denoting qualities or attributes. Some languages have an open class
of adjectives as the case in English and German, whereas others have a
close class of adjectives as the case in Igbo (Kwa, Niger-Congo, Nigeria)
which has only eight. Other languages lack a distinct class of adjectives
altogether (Schachter, 1985).",[124]
"
Perfectivity indicates completed action with a beginning, middle and end.
In general the perfective aspect in Tima is marked morphologically by a                                         181
suffix '-ataŋ' on verbs 9. This suffix indicates both the perfectivity andcompletion of an action, especially when it is clearly contrasted with an
imperfective form; see the examples below.
(64)
       a) ɛɛ-k-ʌl-ʌk-ataŋ-nin         ASP.PAST.1plexcl-Epen-eat-AP-Comp-1plexcl

       'he drank milk'The perfective suffix '-ataŋ' is often pronounced [ata]. The final nasal 'ŋ'usually disappears in casual speech, see example (65).

        'I broke the stick yesterday'
9
    The suffix 'ataŋ' has a number of different functions in Tima language (see the suffix 'ataŋ' on a
verb). The suffix 'ataŋ' also appears in the imperative forms. In this case it means that an addressee
should complete doing an action/command.
mɔɔk-ataŋ        ɪhɪ        'drink the milk (completely)'/'drink up the milk'
                                                     182
4.4.2.4 Telic/atelic verbs
The word telic originates from the Greek word 'telos' which means 'end'.
Telic verbs refer to situations which have a terminal point; i.e. the
situation has a definite end. The term telic situation corresponds to the
term 'accomplishment'; atelic verbs refer to the situations that can be
protracted indefinitely or be broken off (Lehmann, 1991).","[202, 203, 204]"

Theseverbs use the suffix '-Vl' to express that meaning. The reversive suffix '-Vl' is considered as a part of the verb stem which derives the reversivemeaning but it does not affect the number of argument. Moreover, themeaning of the verb can not stand by itself unless the 'Vl' suffix isattached to it. This suffix is not productive in Tima. It occurs in P2 in
Table (4.5) with its canonical shape of 'VC'. The suffix vowel is
determined by the root weather it should be front/back vowel or ± ATR.

Having finished discussing the derivational processes with the various
suffixes or markers used in deriving verbs out of verbs (verb-to-verb
derivations in section 4.5), another grammatical mechanism related to
verbs (nominalizing of verbs into a noun as in 5.1.1 or to an adjective).
This alternative process is expressed by deriving a new category called
'verbal adjectives' (Deutscher, 2005). In this case the verb is turning into
an adjective (verb-to-adjective). This term is referred to in Indo-European
languages, for example English, as 'a participle' 27. The participle/ verbal
adjective is a verb that is used to modify a noun, for instance, as in 'the
crying girl' (Deutscher, 2005: 346).","[264, 265]"

(IV) The glide 'w' or 'y' is inserted between the verb root/stem and theverbal noun suffix '-Vl', when the verbal nouns derive from a verb rootwhich ends with a vowel; i.e. it occurs intervocalically. These glides arecalled epenthetic glides. The choice of the glide, either 'w' or 'y', shouldbe harmonized with the verb root/stem vowel; i.e. if the verb rootcontains a back rounded vowel, the glide 'w' should be inserted in order toavoid the combination of vowel sequences. The glide 'y' is inserted whenthe verb root consists of a front/central vowel (Bashir forthcoming).",[300]
"2.2.1.2 Stem modifications
A stem modification is another process which affects word structure; it
involves non-concatenation morphology 5 . Spencer (1991) stated that
stem modifications in many languages indicate grammatical categories by
a shift of vowel, consonant, stress and tone. English is an example where
the vowel alternation device marks tense in verbs such as 'drink/drank/
5
 The process of non-concatenative morphology indicates that the complex derived word form can not
be easily segmented into different morphemes; instead the morphological process can be described in
  process terms (Haspelmath, 2002).",[41]

In this
case they function as noun modifiers, as in (161). They are structured bythe relativizer 'kV-', which is also attested with adjectives when theyfunction as attributive modifiers in the NP. In this case the verbal
adjectives behave like pure/content adjectives (Sasse, 1993) 28.

It has been found in the data that the verbal adjectives can be derived
from the verbal nouns or abstract nouns (see 5.1.3) which describe stative
situations (mainly deriving from stative verbs) which end in the stative28
  The term 'pure/content adjectives is used by Sasse (1993) and Deutscher (2005) to refer to the
English adjectives like 'tall, short, big, small, etc'.","[266, 267]"

The definite future indicates that an action will take place definitely a
shortly after the time of the utterance; i.e. there is no long distance or time
elapsing between the speech moment and the reference time of the action.
It is not possible to use the definite future in order to express an action
that will take place later on, tomorrow for example.",[183]
"
4.6 Verbal negation
Tima has different types of negation marking. That is, the negative
strategy in Tima involves negation of the whole clause, in which case it is
described as clausal negation. Or, alternatively, it negates some of the
clause constituents, such as nouns, adverbs, adjectives and quantifiers.
This type is described as constituent negation (Alamin forthcoming).",[275]
"
Type 1: Compounds with 'arɔŋ'Compounds can also be formed by a bound word 'arɔŋ', which means'one who likes'. The word 'arɔŋ' must attach to a noun in order to give afull meaning. Thus, the result is agentive noun, as can be seen in (65) (see
5.1.2). It always carries a negative connotation.",[328]
"Moreover, other Tima words which are originally Arabic loan words take                                     63
one of the various singular class prefixes. The choice of the singular class
prefix depends on the root vowel. See the nouns in (21).","[84, 85]"
"
There is a difficulty encountered in various languages when trying to
distinguish between compounds and phrases (especially NP). Fabb (1998)
mentioned that compounds resemble phrasal combination in some ways 6 .
To avoid such resemblance between the two categories a number of
criteria are stated in order to distinguish between them. Firstly, the
phonological criteria sometimes help in that. The suprasegmental
processes, for instance the stress patterns, which are restricted to the
compounds, may differ from those restricted to the phrases (e.g. English,
'the white house').",[46]
"
3.1.2.2 Variation between speakers
It has been observed during the fieldwork that there are phonological
variations occurring between the speakers in their use of certain forms on
the one hand, and the choice of a certain noun-class prefixes, on the other
hand. These variations are due to the age of the speaker, i.e. the
difference between old generation, mid generation and young generation
(Dimmendaal forthcoming).",[91]
"
Negation in Tima is expressed by using different strategies; see section2.4.1.3. On the one hand, it uses two negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' in asingle clause, especially in negating the declarative and imperative
clauses. It is the most common strategy of negation marking in Tima. On
the     other   hand,    Tima       uses   an    inherently   negative   quantifier'amaŋaŋ'/'amaŋ', 'nothing/lack/not-exist' to indicate that the event orsituation described by the verb does not occur or exist.",[275]
"The suffix vowel harmonizes with the root vowel. The suffix '-ik' occurswith both intransitive verbs as the examples in (133), and transitive verbstems, as shown in examples (134). The causative form '-ik' usuallyappears with the transitive marker 'ɪ-/-i'. The combination of the suffix '-ɪ/-i' plus the causative marker '-ik' yields the form '-ɪɪk/-iik'. Withtransitive verbs, the morphological boundaries should be drawn in order
to separate the two morphemes from each other as in the examples below.",[241]
"
Tima does not have a proper system of noun classes as found in Bantu
languages or other Kordofanian languages. Tima has a reduced noun
class system which consists of two sets: an open set of noun classes and a
closed set of noun classes. Tima nouns are classified according to their
number. The noun classes are realized by prefixes. The open set of
classes consists of singular and singulative nouns. They represent four
singular noun class prefixes with their allomorphs (see 3.1.1) and only
one noun class for plural counterparts with its three allomorphs (see
3.1.2) and for the mass/collective nouns (see 3.1.3). This set is very
productive in Tima. The noun classes in the open set can even be applied
to the borrowed nouns. On the other hand, the closed set of classesconsists of 'd-' class for languages (see 3.1.4) and 'lV-' class for locativenouns (see 3.1.5.1). This set is unproductive, especially with regard to thelocative nouns. Hence, the proclitic locative marker 'i-' (see 3.1.5.2) isconsidered most productive than the locative prefix 'lV-'.",[53]
"
The positive imperative form is considered as a simple form in Tima. It is
always used while discussing other word formation processes or in
explaining certain word-structure through out this study. The examples
are:
(115)
2nd sg                    2nd Pl                    gloss
a) dɨŋʌʌŋ                 na- dɨŋʌʌŋ                'bring'b) daa                    na-daa                    'run'c) hʊdɔnɔ                 na-hadɔnɔ                 'sit down'd) hɘlak                  na-hɘlak                  'remain seated'e) paŋa                   na-paŋa                   'open (mouth)'
                                       206
With regard to the imperative formation of the 2nd person plural, it is
noticed that when the form starts with a consonant as in (115), the
personal prefix is just attached to the verb without any change in the
stem. On the other hand, when the imperative form starts with a vowel asin (116), the glide '-y-' is inserted between the prefix and the stem (anepenthetic glide). This occurs in order to avoid the combination of two
vowels.
(116)
2nd.sg                   2nd.pl                    gloss

The structure of the positive imperative forms can be represented by the
following formula:
a) 2nd Sg: ø-stem
b) 2nd Pl:   na-stem
In addition, there are a number of suppletive imperative forms in Tima.
The imperative form of the 2nd person plural is completely different from
the imperative form of the 1st person singular. Therefore, the 2nd plural
imperative forms are not predictable (see also 4.5.1.2). The examples are:
                                     207

Subjunctive mood refers to verb forms or sentence type which indicate
the attitude of the speaker including tentativeness, vagueness, request or
uncertainty. It is considered as an indirect command. It always asks for
permission (Lyons, 1995).","[227, 228, 229]"
"
Tima has other verbs that are often used iteratively without any
derivational marker as the case mentioned above. For example:
(100)
a) ŋuni          'move repeatedly'              <   awun   'move once'
b) tɘɘn          'run and run (repeatedly)'     <   daa    'run'
c) taan          'knock/hit repeatedly'         <   hɔɔ    'hit once'
Class 6: Inceptive situations/aspect
Payne (1997: 240) mentions that ""inceptive aspect expresses the starting
point of an event"". It is often translated into English as 'to start doing
something'. Inceptive aspect in Tima is expressed morphologically bymeans of a morpheme '-aa' as a suffix on verbs. In this case the inceptiveaspect indicates either a state or an entry to that state; i.e. the situation is
bounded into its beginning rather than its end (Lehmann, 1991). The
inceptive aspect is associated with perfective aspect but it does not
actually indicate a completion of a situation; in fact, they refer to its
inception. The examples from Tima are:

I am grateful to the Tima native speakers, especially Hamid Kafi and
Nasr Al Deen Abdalla Korsha without whose tolerance this thesis never
would have seen the light. They provided me with almost all of the data
presented in this study. Many thanks are also to the Tima language
committee represented by Babu, Ust. Yagub, Ismael Kafi and to the Tima
people in the Nuba Mountain for their hospitality and generosity.",[13]
"
Tima makes a grammaticalized distinction within the past tense. It makes
distinction between recent past vs. remote past 5. Comrie (1976) referred
to a recent past as an action that took place in the past but with some
relevance in the present time, whereas Bybee (1985: 159) referred to this
tense as anterior which is specifically described as a past event with a
present result. In other languages it is called a perfect. The perfect is
usually treated under the umbrella of aspect, as Comrie (1976) did,
whereas in other literature it is dealt with under tense. Therefore, the
anterior/perfect here will be treated under “tense”, since its meaning
indicates the time of an event/situation and its relation to another time; it
is usually the time of speaking. Moreover, Tima speakers usually refer to
the perfect when they contrast it with the general past. That is, they refer
to the degree of recentness to the time of speech. In this study the term
“recent past"" will be used.",[188]
"
2.4.1.2 Tense/Aspect/Mood
Tense, aspect and mood are the most important inherent categories of
verbs. They are inflected on verb by means of different grammatical
processes such as affixation, stem modification, reduplication or
suppletion. With regard to tense, languages usually make distinctions of
events according to the time of speech. Comrie (1985) mentions that
some languages make a three-way distinction for tense: past, present and
future; for example English and Swahili. Other languages make a two-
way distinction: either between past vs non-past or future vs. non-future;
for example Dyirbal (Australian, northern Queensland) and Hua (a
language of New Guinea). Accordingly, Tima can be characterized as a
language that makes a two-way distinction between future and non-
future. The future in Tima is morphologically marked by a prefix 'dV-'
whereas the non-future (which includes the past and present tense) is
morphologically unmarked, i.e. has a zero morpheme (see 4.4).",[58]

This study tries to describe and analyze the structure of the word in Tima
(a Kordofanian language), mainly the structure of the noun and the verb.
Its aim is to fulfill the following two objectives: first, to provide a
comprehensive description of unwritten language. Secondly, to document
Tima as one of the endangered languages in Sudan.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

1.7 Presentation of language data
The Tima language data are presented, for those who want to study/ learn
it, in the following way. In each example, there are three lines: the first
line gives the data in the Tima language. The second line is a word-for-
word translation into English. It includes a number of abbreviations that
are listed in the list of abbreviation (pp xii). The third line gives a free
translation of phrases and clauses in English so that those who do not
understand Tima can understand the meaning.",[32]

It is noticed that there is vowel length with regard to the negative formThe vowel of the negative proclitic 'kV(V)-' is lengthened. It is a result ofthe combination of the proclitic vowel and the person marker in the caseof 2nd sg and 1pl incl, which is usually represented by the vowel 'a-' and'i-', respectively (see 4.4.3.1).",[279]

2.2.1.4 Compounding
Compounding is another morphological process shared in the formation
of word structure. Spencer (1991: 309) defined compounding as
""prototypically the concatenation of words to form other words"". A
compound form consists of two/more members of (potentially) open
lexical class. For instance, English allows several types of combinations
of different word-classes (N+N, A+N, V+N, N+V, N+A, A+A, etc.).
Usually, the two items that are brought together in a compound also
                                     24
appear as independent words in a language on the one hand (e.g.
blackboard). On the other hand, one of the compound elements can
appear as an independent word (e.g. strawberry). Sometimes, both
members of compound are elements that only occur together (e.g.
mushroom) (Fabb, 1998).","[45, 46]"
"
2.2.1.5. Suppletion
By definition, suppletion is the complete (or partial) replacement of one
form by another, as in the English example of 'goes' and went' (Finegan,
2004). This type of suppletive forms is quite common in Greek verbs,
while in North American languages, the suppletive forms are common
among numbers (Matthews, 1991).",[47]
"
With this background information one can imagine the linguistic
complexity involved in the case of the Tima community, a constellation
which is not strange or extraordinary when compared with the language
situation in the Nuba Mountains in general (see Abu-Manga and Abu-
Bakr, 2006).",[26]

The imperfective aspect of the above verbs is formed either by internal
change of the root in addition to the dropping of the suffix, as in the caseof example (75 and 77) with the verb 'tɔmɔ', 'kill', whereas in the case ofthe verb 'tiyu', 'open' as in example (76) above, the imperfective aspect ofthat verb is formed by using the imperfective/habitual aspect marker '-a/-ʌ'. For the imperfective sentences, see the example in (77) and (78),respectively.

Class 2: Suppletive verbs
The second class involves a group of verbs where there is no relation
between the telic verb form and the atelic one. That is, the telic verb is
completely different from the atelic verb; i.e. it is a suppletive form. They
are lexically related from a semantic point of view. Thus, it is
                                           189
unproductive to derive the telic verb out of the atelic verb or vice versa.
This class of suppletive verbs, which are used in order to distinguish
between telic (perfective) and atelic verbs (imperfective), is common in
Nilo-Saharan languages. The verb forms in (79) are examples of this
class.","[209, 210, 211]"

P1 involves the transitive markers which are found in Tima. It occurs
close to the verb root and it is not possible for any other morpheme to
interfere between this transitive marker and the verb root. It is usuallyrepresented by a single vowel (e.g. '-V-') which is influenced by the rootvowel harmony (for the examples see Section 4.5.1.1 on transitive
suffixes). These transitive suffixes are inherent to the verb root. This
property justifies their appearance in verbal noun forms, e.g. the transitivesuffix '-i' (see 5.1.1) and abstract nouns, e.g. the transitive suffix '-a' (see5.1.3).","[269, 270]"
