       response.
    The response usually is a reply to the speaker’s words or an acknowledgment of his words, by the
repetition of the speaker's words, either the complete utterance or the final portion of it. The
section-final pause (a down glide) signals the listener to provide the response. Occasionally the
 listener may interrupt before the section-final pause. The speaker usually continues with what he
was saying, ignoring the interruption.
    in order to signal that he is finished, the speaker repeats (Repit) the response of the listener. This
also permits a chaige of speakers so that the listener becomes the speaker.

                . (it was a long time ago.)
   When additional participants desire to add to a conversation, they do not do so overtly. They do
it by interjecting (Inter) a comment preceding the new section. (See 3.3 [1J.) They choose one of
the main participants, usually a relative, such as a wife, husband, brother or mother through whom
to talk. The culture decrees that only certain individuals freely converse with each other. For
example, a mother-in-law greets her son-in-law, but then she talks to him through her daughter.
Only if there is no other appropriate relative through whom she may converse, does she speak to
him directly.
   if a wife wishes to participate in a conversation which her husband is having with another man or
woman she tells her husband what to say to that individual. She uses the command form jaade, ‘tell
him’. The husband repeats what she has said, omitting the command form. The second speaker then
responds to what the husband has said, ignoring the wife.
   The two main speakers usually talk loud enough for all to hear and they do not face one another
but sit or stand with their backs to each other.
   A response is obligatory and is one of the following:

§.2. Tagmemic Formulae. In the following formulae, the most common order of the tagmemes
     is given. However, the order of the tagmemes is free, with the following exceptions:
(1) +P with high frequency occurs clause finally, but may be followed by +S, +O and+Rep }.
(2) +Rep 2 always occurs clause finally. Rep 2 is obligatorily present with +Cit in Cl }1, 2}. 51.
(3} +Cit follows +P.
(4)      +intro £Neg occur first of second in the clause when +Voc, tEmb, +Excl are not present.
         When the later are present they precede the +Intro Neg.
(5)      +Empb and +Excl are mutually exclusive.
(6)      +g occurs in portmanteau relationship with any one of the tagmemes +8 +C 15 +0, +L +D +T.
         These latter are then filled, not only by the fillers listed in Sections 5.3.1, 5.3.3, but also bv the
         fillers of +[g when in portmanteau relationship with that slot.
(7)      Rel 1 occurs in portmanteau relationship with £8 or +O. The latter are filled by the fillers
         listed in Sec. 5.3.1 and also by the fillers of Rel } when in portmanteau relationship with that
         slot.                                                                      ;
(8)      Rel 2 occurs in portmanteau relationship with +L. The latter is filled by the fillers listed in
         Sec. 5.3.3 and also by the filter of Rel 2 when in portmanteau relationship with that slot.

                     might be unrecognizable.

         2.        Subentries

                     above items are formed to the corresponding item.

  The most frequent type of discourse in Cuiva is a conversation between two individuals.        Even in
nattative, a second individual must   respond in order to keep the speaker talking.   When   under the
influence of vopo, a hallacinatory drug similar to marijuana in action, an individnal may talk to
himself without the need for a response.","[11, 12, 13, 14]"

0.1.  Cuiva isa Guajiban language of the Hanus or plains country in the states of Vichada, Boyaca,
      and Arauca in the east central portion of Colombia, South America, The Cuiva Indians live by
hunting and gathering in the jungles along the Meta, Casanare, and Capanapara Rivers and their
tributaries.
   The language is spoken by an undetermined number of nomadic groups, and estimates of total
population range from several hundred to 8,060. We have had contact with five Cuiva groups or
bands: (1) the Pin Menepiwi (the Big River people), (2) the Mayaraxi (the Mayayeros), (3) the
Yarawutixi, (4) the Wapiwi, and (5) two groups of Aitowapiwi (Masiguares), All the groups are
called Cuiva by the Colombian settlers. There are very slight dialectical differences among these
groups. The Cuiva of the Tomo River (6) in Vichada are of another dialect more closely related to
Guajibo. For the general location of the above groups see the area map of the Cuiva migrations.
The Pin Menepiwi dialect is described here.
   The data for this description were gathered during field work under the auspices of the Summer
Institute of Linguistics from July 1965 to December 1967 and trom July 1969 to March 1970. The
material was gathered using a monolingual approach, since there were no Cuiva who spoke Spanish.
The main informants were:         ;
      Waro       (1965-67)                          Warawanayo     (1969-70)
      Wasimo     (1965-67, 69-70)                   Tabsi          (1967, 1969-70)
      Sepia      (1966-67; died 1968)                  ;
   We are grateful to all the Cuiva Indians for their acceptance of us and their persistence in helping
us to learn their language well.Many of themassisted in teaching us their language, both in their
semi-permanent    village at Mochuelo     and when   we travelled with them on the Meta and Casanare
Rivers.","[9, 10, 11]"

      Cuiva        texts, these two were edited in order to show          the basic grammatical structure of the
language.
   It should be noted that there is always a response included in their speaking. A man awakens his
wife or another member of the family when he wants to talk at night. All they need to do is gnint
at the appropriate time and he continues to talk or tell a story for hours. At times we have heard a
man provide his own response. He takes the part of both the speaker and the listener, adding the
appropriate response as needed.
   There is a large amount of repetition in the texts. Some of this has been left in to illustrate its
frequency.         Subjects and objects are not marked, and at times the Jocation-time markers are also
omitted when the meaning can be understood from the context. Nouns and verbs are frequently
given in the singular even when a plural is implied.
   When a Cuiva returns from a trip, he or she begins conversing with a relative. The two talk
loudly enough for most of the people to hear. The response is often shouted loudly enough to be
picked np and repeated around the camp.                                                         ;9.2. The Buzzard. This is a series of short stories told by Tabshi (T) to Isabel (EF. In order to keep
      him talking, she used verbal responses including mm and the nonverbal response, a nod of the
head.

indicated here.
