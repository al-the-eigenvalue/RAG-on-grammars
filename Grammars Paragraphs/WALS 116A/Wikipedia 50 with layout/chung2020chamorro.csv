"22.2     Polar questions and alternative questionsPolar questions are questions that can be answered hunggan ‘yes’ or åhi’
‘no’. Alternative questions explicitly present two (or more) alternatives for
the answer. Like many other languages, Chamorro treats polar questions and
alternative questions alike. When these questions serve as main clauses, they
are either introduced by the complementizer kåo (glossed Q) or else distin-
guished from statements merely by question intonation. (Question intonation
is indicated by a sharp final rise; see Topping and Dungca 1973: 163-164.)
The options are illustrated for polar questions in (1).(1) a.   Kåo     guaha       nai      manli’i’       håo      lu’åo?

bedded clauses in complex sentences. Then they must be introduced by the
complementizer kåo (see 20.2.1, 20.3.1, and 20.4.1). Consider the embedded
polar questions in (3) and the embedded alternative questions in (4).(3) a.    Ti hu tungu’ [kåo         måolik

2.2.2.1.1      Pronounciation notes
The sound /h/ is often omitted in Chamorro, so the 1 sg. hu is typically
pronounced [u], and the 3 sg. realis ha is typically pronounced [ɑ]. The
orthographies represent the 1 excl. du./pl. as in and the 2 du./pl. as en, but
they have the same pronunciation (i.e. [In] in (35b)). The fact that these two
forms are pronounced the same has a result that language learners might
appreciate. A polar question whose subject is first person inclusive
dual/plural can be answered by simply repeating the words of the question
without changing the form of agreement (see (35a)). In spoken Chamorro,
the same holds true of certain polar questions whose subject is second
person dual/plural. As long as the predicate is a transitive verb, the question
can be answered without overtly “changing” the agreement, because the 1
excl. du./pl. in and the 2 du./pl. en are pronounced the same. See (35b).(35) a.   Kåo     ta nisisita ayudu? — Hunggan, ta nisisita ayudu.
          Q         AGR need   help       yes           AGR need     help
          ‘Do we (incl.) need help? — Yes, we (incl.) need help.’
       b. Kåo     en nisisita ayudu? — Hunggan, in nisisita ayudu.
          Q       AGR need     help       yes           AGR need     help
          ‘Do you (du./pl.) need help? — Yes, we (excl.) need help.’     The first person agreement forms in the irrealis mood include optional
material. The 1 incl. du./pl. irrealis form is usually realized as ta; the pre-
ceding u is now less commonly used. Acccording to Costenoble (1940: 307)
and Topping and Dungca (1973: 262), the bai in the other first person
irrealis forms may be borrowed from Spanish voy. Bai is often present, but
can be omitted. In the 1 sg. irrealis agreement form, either bai or hu can be
omitted, but not both.","[47, 48]"

         ‘Because of that they wanted to push him out.’ (Ginen I Obispo
         March 2, 2003)     Essentially the same patterns were documented earlier for displaced
interrogative phrases (in 22.3.2 and 22.3.3).
     In terms of function, the focus construction provides one way—but not
the only way—of answering a constituent question formed by wh-move-
ment. Consider the question in (15a), in which the subject is a displaced
interrogative word. This question can be answered with the ordinary
transitive clause in (15b) or with the focus construction in (15c). The dif-
ference is that (15b) allows for the possibility that there are others besides
Jose’s teacher who also know the answer, but (15c) does not.(15) a.  Håyi tumungu’              i ansa?

         the teacher.L Jose         WH[SBJ].know    the answer
         ‘Jose’s teacher (is the one who) knows the answer.’    Note that the focus construction can occur inside a polar or alternative
question. In such cases, the syntactically focused constituent is preceded by
the complementizer kåo.(16)a.    Kåo    hamyu lokkui’ ti siña          manmangumprendi?

"22.1     OverviewChamorro has several strategies for forming questions. One strategy for
forming constituent questions involves the dependency known as wh-move-
ment. When an interrogative word or phrase is displaced to the left edge of a
question by wh-movement, special types of agreement, called wh-agreement
and complementizer agreement, are used to register information about the
constituent that has been displaced.
     This chapter is devoted to questions. 22.2 describes the formation of
polar questions and alternative questions. Then, 22.3 lays out the basics of
constituent questions, 22.4 describes the details of wh-agreement and com-
plementizer agreement, and 22.5 discusses embedded questions and long-
distance questions.",[512]
"22.5      Constituent questions in complex sentences22.5.1 Embedded questions
Like polar questions and alternative questions (see 22.2), constituent ques-
tions can be embedded in complex sentences, where they serve as arguments
of a higher predicate (see 20.3.1 and 20.4.1). Embedded constituent ques-
tions have the same form as constituent questions in simple sentences. The
interrogative word or phrase can occur as the (embedded) predicate, or it can
be displaced by wh-movement, accompanied by wh-agreement and comple-
mentizer agreement.
     In embedded questions of the predicate, the interrogative word or phrase
occurs in situ (see 22.3.1), as illustrated in (37). These questions generally
are not introduced by an overt complementizer.(37) a.Ripåra [håyi achahit-miyu].

         August 25, 2002)     In embedded questions of arguments or adjuncts, the interrogative word
or phrase is displaced to the left edge of the embedded question (see 22.3.2
and 22.3.3), and information about the displaced constituent is registered by
wh-agreement and complementizer agreement (see 22.4). This means,
among other things, that complementizer agreement dictates the form of the
complementizer of the embedded question. Some examples of embedded
questions of arguments are cited in (38). (Note that in (38a) and (38e), the
entire complex sentence is a polar question introduced by the comple-
mentizer kåo. In (38d), the embedded questions are coordinated; the first is a
question of a direct object and the second, a question of an adjunct.)(38) a.    Kao      un tungu’ [håyi manggera]?

the embedded questions in (39b) are coordinated. The interrogative word
ngai’an ‘when?’ serves as an adjunct in the first question, and as the em-
bedded predicate of the second question.)(39) a.   Marikunosi               si      Jack    put    [taimanu

questions in which an infinitive clause is introduced by the interrogative
complementizer kåo or begins with a displaced interrogative word or phrase.
There are no exact Chamorro equivalents of English infinitival questions
like They wondered whether to leave early or It was unclear who to invite.
Embedded questions formed with taimanu ‘how?’ are sometimes translated
into English as infinitival questions, as in (40). But these Chamorro ques-
tions are finite embedded questions in which taimanu ‘how?’ serves as the
embedded predicate, and the apparent infinitive is a reduced clause that
serves as the embedded subject (see 21.6.4).","[530, 531, 532]"

In (21c), the state of it being not so hot overlaps with the state of it being

states. The progressive can be used for a state in which the subject takes an
active role. In (22a), the speaker is viewed as wanting to be actively going
ahead down the road; in (22b), the addressee is viewed as actively busy at
her job.(22) a.Ya-hu         ha’      mofo’na             påpa’ gi chalan.

       ‘As time goes on, I get sadder and sadder.’Finally, the progressive can be used when the state is viewed as persisting,
perhaps despite expectations. In such cases, the predicate is usually followed
by the emphatic particle ha’ (see 23.2).(24) a.   Guaha       gagaigi           ha’     gi papa’      lamasa.

with the idea that they describe states rather than events (see 2.2.2.1 for the
details). Nonetheless, these predicates can appear in the progressive, al-
though the neutral aspect is also possible. The nuances that determine which
aspect is chosen can be difficult to pin down. Compare (25a), in which the
adjective fresku ‘fresh’ appears in the progressive, and (25b), in which the
same predicate appears in the neutral aspect.(25) a.   Frefresku        i hanum kada             manhånåo ham

        ‘The water is fresh every time we (excl.) go there.’2.2.1.2.3    Interaction of aspect with negation
Generally speaking, negation does not have an effect on the choice of aspect:
aspect is used in the same way in negative clauses as in the corresponding
clauses without negation. The progressive is used for events that are in
progress with respect to some other event, for repeated events, and for states
that are viewed as persisting. The neutral aspect is used otherwise. In (26),
the predicate usa ‘use’ is in the progressive because it describes a repeated
action, and the predicate tungu’ ‘know’ is in the neutral aspect because it
describes a state.","[41, 42, 43]"
"9.2.2 Meaning and use
General indefinites occur only in constituent questions, negative sentences,
the antecedent clause of conditionals, the standard of comparative sentences,
and free choice contexts. Each of these constructions makes its own con-
tribution to the general indefinite’s meaning and dictates certain aspects of
its distribution. 9.2.2.1 describes the meaning and use of general indefinites
in constituent questions. 9.2.2.2 describes their patterning in negative sen-
tences. 9.2.2.3 deals with general indefinites in conditionals and comparative
sentences, and 9.2.2.4, with free choice contexts. Finally, 9.2.2.5 briefly
describes concealed conditionals.",[219]

This can be seen from the contrast between the statement and the corres-
ponding question in (43). (The relevant noun phrase is enclosed in brackets.)(43) a.  Ha kuntetesta si          Lucy [i kåtta ginin i

         letter
         (‘From whom is Lucy answering the letter?’)Similarly, no argument contained within the i construction can be ques-
tioned, focused or relativized. Compare the statement and the corresponding
question in (44).(44) a.   Båba        i [para un fåla’           i guihan].

         eat.raw
         (‘How many kinds of fish is it not good for you to eat raw?’)This is yet another respect in which the i construction resembles a noun
phrase and differs from an embedded clause introduced by na. When an
embedded clause is introduced by na, the arguments it contains can routinely
be questioned, focused, or relativized, as (45) is intended to suggest.(45)a.    Båba        [na      para    un fåla’     i   guihan].

     In short, the i construction is a noun phrase in which the definite article
is followed by an embedded clause.
     It is more difficult to pinpoint how, if at all, the i construction differs in
meaning or function from a finite embedded clause introduced by the com-
plementizer na. Since the i construction is introduced by the definite article
(see 6.2.1.2.1), one might imagine that the statement expressed by the em-
bedded clause is already familiar to both speaker and addressee (i.e. it is part
of the common ground). And indeed, the i construction typically occurs in
contexts that meet this description. It often serves as the subject of pred-
icates that are evaluative adjectives or noun phrases; see e.g. (37c), (38),
(39), and (44a).
     The i construction may well be the Chamorro analogue of English noun
phrases in which a noun like fact or idea is followed by a finite embedded
clause (which is sometimes called an appositive clause). Further research is
needed to take this conjecture further. Note that Chamorro does have noun
phrases in which an overt noun is followed by an appositive clause, such as
the embedded clause enclosed in brackets in (46), but these are relatively
infrequent.","[476, 477, 478]"
"9.2.2.1      In questions
General indefinites serve as interrogative words in constituent questions. In
this use, they can be translated into English as follows: håyi ‘who?’, håfa
‘what?’, (a)månu ‘where?’, ngai’an ‘when?’, kuåntu ‘how much, how
many?’, and taimånu ‘how?’. Interrogative phrases in Chamorro are dis-
placed to the left edge of the question by wh-movement (see 22.3). This is
why the general indefinite—that is, the interrogative word—appears at the
194

beginning of the constituent questions below. (The questions in (8b) and
(8d) occur in embedded clauses, which are enclosed in brackets.)(8) a. Håyi tumutuhun            i mimu?

       atan    [taimanu gui’         umo’mak].
       watch how?           he       AGR.swim
       ‘Chungi’ told Kanåriu to watch how he swam.’ (EM 83)     The general indefinite håfa has some further uses in constituent ques-
tions. It combines with the prepositions sa’ ‘because of’ and para ‘for’ to
form the interrogative phrases sa’ håfa ‘why?’ and para håfa ‘what for, what
is the point of?’. (Para håfa is also a fixed expression meaning ‘never mind,
forget it, don’t bother’.) In addition, it combines with the general indefinite
taimanu to form the interrogative phrase håfa taimanu, ‘how? (manner,
means)’, which has the same meaning and distribution as the interrogative
word taimanu ‘how? (manner, means)’.
     As mentioned earlier, interrogative phrases formed with the indefinite
determiner (a)månu range over a pre-established set. (A)månu in this use can
be translated ‘which?’ (see (9a)). Interrogative phrases formed with the
indefinite determiners håyi (human) or håfa (nonhuman) can range over pre-
established sets, but need not do so. Håyi and håfa in this use can be
translated ‘what?’ or ‘which?’ (see (9b-d)).(9) a. Månu na lupis para            un håtmi?

fic indefinites. In such cases, håyi can be translated ‘any(one)’, håfa can be
translated ‘any(thing)’, and so on.","[219, 220, 221]"
"
15.4       InterjectionsInterjections are word-sized or phrase-sized expressions used on their own to
make conversational moves. Like other languages, Chamorro has a large
number of interjections. This section surveys some of the most common
interjections used to affirm, deny, greet, bid farewell to, thank, and hesitate.
     The affirmative interjections include the polite hunggan ‘yes’ and the
more informal affirmatives (h)å’a, (h)u’u, and u nai, all of which mean ‘yes,
yeah’.
     There is one negative interjection, åhi’ ‘no’. Doubt, uncertainty, or inde-
cision can be expressed with hekkua’ ‘I don’t know, dunno’. Hekkua’ can be
followed by an embedded question, as in (25).(25) a.   Hekkua’     håfa     na        ti anåkku’        esti i gigåo.
          dunno       what? COMP not AGR.long              this the fish.trap

          dunno       Q for         UNM      devil or for           UNM
          Yu’us ...
          God
          ‘I don’t know if we’re for the devil or for God...’ (from a tape-
          recorded narrative)     The common greetings include håfa dai ‘hello, hi’ and, more recently in
the CNMI, buenas ‘hello, good day’. (Buenas is shortened from greetings
borrowed from Spanish, e.g. buenas dihas ‘good day’, buenas notchis ‘good
evening’.) The common farewells include the informal esta ‘okay, see you’
and the more formal adios ‘good-bye, farewell’, which is used for partings
that are more serious or of longer duration.
     Other common interjections include buen binidu ‘welcome’, put fabót
‘please’, si Yu’us ma’åsi’ ‘thank you (lit. God is merciful)’, diahlu ‘no thank
you (used e.g. when declining food)’, ai adai, ‘oh dear, my goodness’, and
po’lu ya... ‘let go of it, let’s put it off’.
     The pause or hesitation form, roughly equivalent to English ‘uh’, is nu.",[376]

8 that weak pronouns can serve as subjects, but not as the subjects of tran-
sitive verbs. The reason is that transitive verbs show person-and-number
agreement with their subjects, and pronouns that are cross-referenced by
agreement in person must be null (see 8.4.2). Consequently, from the
perspective of this book, Topping and Dungca’s property (iii) is equivalent
to the property of being a content word that is intransitive. (See Topping,
Ogo, and Dungca 1975: xx, where this is made explicit.)
      The defining characteristic of the words in Class III is their exception-
ality. They include the existential verbs (see 14.2.2), the verbs of possession
(14.3), verbs that show agreement as if they were nouns (14.4), the pred-
icates used in negative imperatives (15.2.2); and a phonologically dependent
predicate (malak ‘go to’; 2.2.1.1.2). Every approach to Chamorro grammar
must treat these predicates specially. There is, however, no positive distribu-
tional evidence that they form a unified class. This suggests that they should
be set aside for the purposes of this discussion.
      Two questions now arise about the words in the ‘regular’ Classes I and
II. Does Chamorro have distributional patterns that divide the words in Class
II (i.e. the intransitive content words) into different subclasses? And does the
language have distributional patterns that group the words in Class I (that is,
the transitive verbs) together with some intransitive content words, but not
others? These questions are addressed next.","[626, 627]"

from the other three. (Each row has a different combination of ‘yes’ and ‘no’
cells.) This finding argues against Topping and Dungca’s Chamorro-specific
system of parts of speech. In particular, it contradicts their claim that the
words in their Class II (i.e. B, C, and D words) form a single undifferen-
tiated class. But it is compatible with the approach to parts of speech taken
in this book, according to which Chamorro content words are classified as
nouns, verbs, or adjectives and further cross-classified for transitivity. (18)
shows how this more traditional approach treats the four subclasses of words
investigated earlier in this section.",[633]
"22.3.3 Questions of adjuncts
Interrogative words or phrases can serve as adjuncts to the predicate or to the
clause. Adjuncts are optional constituents that provide information about the
event or state’s location in time or space, duration, frequency, manner,
means, degree, cause, purpose, and so on (see 3.3). Adjuncts that are in-
terrogative words or phrases are displaced to the left edge of the question by
wh-movement. Some examples are given below.",[519]

22QUESTIONS
         Chamorro has several strategies for forming questions. One
         strategy involves the dependency known as wh-movement.
         When an interrogative word or phrase is displaced to the
         left edge of a question by wh-movement, special types of
         agreement are used to register information about the dis-
         placed constituent.","[510, 511, 512]"

22.5.2 Long-distance questions
In a complex sentence, it is possible for an interrogative word or phrase from
an embedded clause—either a finite embedded clause or an infinitive
clause—to be displaced to the left edge of a higher clause. The result is a
long-distance dependency: the displaced constituent ends up one or more
clauses removed from the predicate it is associated with. Consider the long-
distance questions in (41).(41)a.   Håyi i doktu ma po’lu [na                   esta     måmåolik]?
         who? the doctor AGR assume COMP already AGR.good.PROG

         ANTIP.look.for   a new         L   car
         ‘Where do they want you to look for a new car?’In these questions, the interrogative word or phrase at the left edge of the
higher clause has been displaced from the embedded clause. In (41a), håyi
‘who?’ is the subject of the embedded adjective måolik ‘good’; in (41b),
håfa na disgråsia ‘what disaster?’ is the direct object of the embedded verb
cho’gui ‘make, do’; and in (41c), gi månu ‘where?’ is an adjunct of the em-
bedded verb phrase. Long-distance questions in Chamorro must involve wh-
movement. Consequently, the interrogative word or phrase can be an argu-
ment or adjunct, but not a predicate, because predicates in Chamorro are not
displaced by wh-movement (see 22.3.1).
     As expected, information about the displaced constituent in a long-
distance question is registered by wh-agreement and complementizer agree-
ment. Complementizer agreement registers information about the displaced
constituent on the complementizer of the question (see 22.4.2). This special
agreement is responsible for the fact that the interrogative word or phrase is
followed by the complementizer na in (41c), but by the null complementizer
in (41a-b). Wh-agreement registers the grammatical relation of the displaced
constituent on the predicate associated with it (see 22.4.1). This special

agreement is overtly realized on the embedded predicates in the long-dis-
tance questions in (42).(42) a.Håyi sinangåni          håo      gi as    nanå-mu

       Pedro OBL car
       ‘How do you want Pedro to fix the car?’     Over and above this, the higher predicates within a long-distance ques-
tion also show wh-agreement. Wh-agreement on a higher predicate does not
register the grammatical relation of the displaced constituent, but rather the
grammatical relation of the embedded clause from which it has been
displaced. This can be seen from the pairs of questions below. Consider first
the long-distance question in (43a) and the embedded long-distance question
in (43b).(43)a. Håfa dinisehan-ñiha            [para uma        kumpli]?

       FUT      AGR do
       ‘Can you make certain of what you want to do?’ (CD, entry for
       na’fitmi)The displaced interrogative word (håfa ‘what?’) is the direct object of the
embedded verb kumpli ‘accomplish’ in (43a) and the direct object of the
embedded verb cho’gui ‘do’ in (43b). Consequently, both of these verbs
show (the null form of) object wh-agreement. The higher verbs within these
long-distance questions also show wh-agreement. In (43a), the verb diseha
‘wish’ shows (the overt form of) object wh-agreement; this is because the                                                                          509
embedded clause para uma kumpli ‘they will accomplish’ serves as its direct
object. But in (43b), the verb malagu’ ‘want’ shows oblique wh-agreement,
because the embedded clause para un cho’gui ‘you will do’ serves as its
oblique argument.
    The overall pattern is similar in the pair of questions in (44).(44) a.   Håfa na sapåtus hinassom-mu                [ti omlåp-mu]?
          what? L shoes WH[OBJ].think-AGR not WH[OBL].fit- AGR

of omlap ‘fit’, and håyi ‘who?’ in (44b) is the oblique argument of asudda’
‘meet (lit. find each other)’. Consequently, both omlap and asudda’ show
oblique wh-agreement. The higher verbs within these questions also show
wh-agreement. In (44a), hassu ‘think’ shows (the overt form of) object wh-
agreement, because the embedded clause from which håfa na sapatus has
been displaced serves as its direct object. But in (44b), malagu’ ‘want’
shows oblique wh-agreement, because the embedded clause from which håyi
has been displaced serves as its oblique argument.
     Higher predicates in a long-distance question generally show wh-agree-
ment when the interrogative word or phrase is an argument or a ‘close’
adjunct—an instrument, manner phrase, or means phrase (see Chung 1994;
1998). In long-distance questions of other types of adjuncts, higher predi-
cates might or might not show wh-agreement. Compare (45), in which the
higher predicate shows wh-agreement, with (41c), in which it does not.","[532, 533, 534, 535]"

Chamorro, almost all interrogative words are general indefinites (see 9.2.1).
Interrogative words can serve as predicates, arguments, or adjuncts. They
can also be part of phrases that serve as predicates, arguments, or adjuncts,
in which case the phrase is called an interrogative phrase. The syntactic
function of interrogative words and phrases affects the form of the question,
including whether wh-movement and the special types of agreement asso-
ciated with it are involved. The details are described below.","[513, 514]"
"19.4      Coordination of wordsThe conjunctions yan ‘and’, pat ‘or’, and o sino ‘or (else)’ can be used to
combine words from the same part of speech. Coordinate structures of this
type are typically formed from nouns, verbs, or adjectives. The sentences in
(17) illustrate a coordinate noun (in (17a)), a coordinate verb with multiple
conjuncts (17b), and a coordinate adjective (17c).(17) a.   Gi kada    [siudå] o sino [songsung] ni          manmåttu

         ‘The akangkang is a good and fresh herbal medicine.’ (CD, entry
         for akangkang)Coordinate structures can also be formed from adverbs (as in (18a)), numer-
als (18b), or interjections (18c).(18) a.  Siña    ha’       manmåttu [på’gu] o sino [agupa’].

tions, tense-aspect-mood markers, and the like.
     Typically, each conjunct has its own inflection in coordinate structures
of this type. Conjuncts that are verbs or predicate adjectives are each marked
for aspect, mood, and agreement with the subject (see 2.2).(19) a.   Asta    på’gu ha’           [manmamaigu’] yan       [mandiskåkansa]

distribution within the word. This consonant apparently does not occur at the
beginning of words (but see below); when it occurs within a root, it must
follow a vowel or glide (see 29.3.1). And although glottal stop is pronounced
when it occurs right after a stressed vowel, elsewhere it is often assimilated
to an adjacent consonant or simply deleted (see 29.1.2).
     This much is reasonably clear. However, glottal stops also occur in
spoken Chamorro in environments where they are not obviously distinctive
sounds. For instance, when speakers are asked to say a word beginning with
a vowel, such as åsu ‘smoke’, in isolation, they sometimes will pronounce
the word with no initial onset ([ɒsu]) or with initial breathy voice ([ɦɒsu]),
but other times will pronounce it with an initial glottal stop ([ʔɒsu]). The last
pronunciation raises a question: might the Chamorro words traditionally
described as beginning with a vowel actually begin with the phoneme glottal
stop? If such a reanalysis were adopted in its most general form, the lan-676
                                                           Sounds and spelling
guage would have no vowel-initial words at all. Instead, all words formerly
thought to be vowel-initial (e.g. åsu) would begin with an initial consonant,
namely, the phoneme glottal stop (as in the hypothetical ’åsu).
      A few descriptions of Chamorro phonology advocate this sort of re-
analysis (see e.g. Topping and Dungca 1973: 170 and Klein 2005: 973). But
when a broader range of facts is considered, it becomes clear that there is
little positive evidence for taking word-initial glottal stop to be a distinctive
sound.
      (i) In a study of the perception and production of glottal stop, Garellek
(2013) observes that “most languages tend to ‘insert’ glottal stops before
vowel-initial words...Glottal stops before word-initial vowels are often op-
tional...No other phonological insertion rule seems to be as widespread as
glottal stop insertion across languages” (2013: 2). This crosslinguistic ten-
dency could well lie behind the Chamorro pronunciation patterns described
just above. If so, the initial glottal stop sometimes heard in the pronunciation
of e.g. åsu would not be present in the underlying form of the word.
      (ii) Glottal stops occur routinely in inflected words in Chamorro to sep-
arate two vowels that would otherwise be adjacent. Specifically:
      When a prefix or proclitic that ends in a vowel is attached to a vowel-
initial word, the two vowels are separated by a glottal stop. See the mor-
pheme combinations and their pronunciations in (48). (Primary stress in
these examples is represented with ˈ. For simplicity, glottal stops that may
precede the inflected word when it is pronounced in isolation are ignored.)(48)    MORPHOLOGY             PRONUNCIATION

           (‘No one reads the newspaper.’)   Just as clearly, the internal argument of antipassive is not a direct object.
When this argument is syntactically realized, it is in the oblique case, not the
unmarked case.(41) a.    Hassånña             si       Pedro manbisita       as nåna

it cannot be questioned or relativized.(42) a.   *Håfa mamåhan             si       Maria gi tenda?

The fact that the agreement of antipassive verbs is chosen from the para-
digms for intransitive verbs and adjectives provides more evidence that the
internal argument is not a direct object, but rather an oblique.
     Because the subject of antipassive is an external argument, it must be
specific (see 16.4). If it occurs within the clause, after the predicate, it cannot
be a quantified noun phrase, a general indefinite, or any other nonspecific
noun phrase.(43) a.  *Manaitai         kada palåo’an lepblu.

         AGR      answer them
         (‘If anyone is asking a question, I will be the one to answer them.’)    The antipassive oblique is not similarly restricted. It can be implicit (not
syntactically realized at all), in which case it is understood as a nonspecific
indefinite (see 9.3.2).(44) a.  Yuti’ i basula sin             un famaisin.

         ‘Ramon went fishing last night, but he didn’t catch (any) because

noun phrase—definite or indefinite, quantified or not quantified, strong or
230
                                                       Passive and antipassive
weak. (It can also be an embedded clause or infinitive.) This can be seen
from (37), (41), and the following.(45) a.   Mungnga mamatcha              ni iyun          ottru tåotåo.

          AGR.ANTIP.plant the farmer         many.L seedling.L sweet.potato
          ‘The farmer planted a lot of sweet potato stems.’ (CD, entry for
          risiembra)However, when the event named by the verb has a lasting effect on the
internal argument and this argument is definite, most speakers do not use the
antipassive (see 10.3.2.3 and Cooreman 1987: 121-124).
     Finally, when a transitive verb has more than two arguments, the verb’s
morphological make-up determines the structure of the corresponding anti-
passive. There are two patterns:
     (i) Chamorro has applicative verbs that are derived by attaching the
suffix -i to a transitive verb (see 11.3.1). One applicative verb of this type is
sangåni ‘say to, tell’, from sångan ‘say’. Applicative verbs of this type have
a third argument that usually names a goal, recipient, or beneficiary and is
realized as their direct object. (The original verb’s internal argument is real-
ized as an oblique.) In the antipassive of an applicative derived with -i, the
additional argument serves as the antipassive oblique. It is almost always
implicit, as in (46) (see 11.3.2.3).","[254, 255, 256]"

PREFACE
This book has taken a long time to complete. That it exists at all is due to the
generosity of many people.
     First of all, I want to acknowledge and thank the speakers of Chamorro
who have generously shared their linguistic insights with me over the years.
Manuel F. Borja has been a consultant, collaborator, friend, and member of
the family, both in Saipan and in the U.S. mainland, for almost as long as I
have been studying the Chamorro language. Of the many others who have
been willing to share their judgments and linguistic intuitions with me, I
especially want to recognize Priscilla Anderson, Antonio M. Atalig, Felix P.
Babauta, Jose A. Bermudez, Jesus M. Cruz, Teresina Garrido, Ray Lujan,
Maria T. Quinata, and the late Agnes C. Tabor (in the continental U.S.); and
Dr. Elizabeth D. Rechebei, Francisco Tomokane, the late Anicia Q.
Tomokane, and the late Maria P. Mafnas (in Saipan).
     Just as important have been the energy and achievements of the people
in the CNMI who have participated in the project to revise the Chamorro-
English dictionary. Great thanks and appreciation to the members of the core
dictionary working groups, who include: Daisy A. Quitugua, Magdalena
S.N. Mesngon, and Aniceto H. Mundo (in Rota); Ester Basa, Angelina C.
Fitial, Bertha M. Pangelinan, Arsene M. Borja, Diana H. Borja, Florine M.
Hofschneider, and Leon Masga (in Tinian); as well as Viola S. De Leon
Guerrero, Jose D.L.G. Sanchez, Bernadita P. Sanchez, the late William I.
Macaranas, Frances M. Sablan, Carmen S. Taimanao, Rosalina M. Magofna,
Bernadita P. Sablan, Esther M. San Nicholas, Maggie C. Untalan, Vicente S.
Borja, Rita C. Guerrero, Glenn H. Manglona, Jose Ch. Camacho, Ana C.
Baer, and Elizabeth D.L.G. Concepcion (in Saipan). The editors—Dr.
Elizabeth D. Rechebei, Tita A. Hocog, Manuel F. Borja, and the late Dr.
Rita H. Inos—have been extraordinarily supportive. Liz, in particular, read
and commented on every draft chapter. Her high level of engagement with
this project has been wonderful. Cameron Fruit provided an electronic copy
of Nuebu Testamento at a key moment. Sen dångkulu na si Yu’us ma’åsi’

     Work on this grammar has been facilitated from the beginning by the
Chamorro-Carolinian Language Policy Commission of the CNMI and the
xviii
NMI Council for the Humanities. I am especially grateful to the present and
past Executive Directors and staff of the CCLPC, especially Melvin O.
Faisao, Cindy P. Reyes, Bernadita P. Sablan, and the late David Omar. I also
want to acknowledge Scott Russell and Paz C. Younis, both formerly of the
Humanities Council, for their assistance. In 2019, I spent several days in
Guam as a consultant on Dr. Robert A. Underwood and Dr. David Ruskin’s
NSF project to document the CHamoru language. Thanks to the Kumision I
Fino’ CHamoru for an enlightening discussion, and especially to Robert and
David for their hospitality.
     At UC Santa Cruz, Prof. Matt Wagers has been a great colleague, friend,
collaborator, and active user of the draft chapters of this manuscript. Our
joint research, which has taught me a lot, has been a real pleasure. I owe a
special debt to Scarlett Clothier-Goldschmidt, whose research showed me
how to do electronic corpus research on Chamorro, and to Boris Harizanov,
who designed the search engine and parser for the revised dictionary. Many
thanks to Prof. Jess Law, who generously talked me through my worries
about the meaning of mampus. Many thanks also to Richard Bibbs, Steven
R. Foley, Jed Pizarro-Guevara, Jake W. Vincent, and—much earlier—to
Jeanne D. Gibson, Catherine Crain, and Ann Cooreman for their interest in
Chamorro linguistics.
     This material is based on work supported in part by the National Science
Foundation under Grants No. BCS-0753594 to the Northern Mariana Islands
Council of the Humanities (Elizabeth D. Rechebei, PI) and BCS-0753240 to
the University of California, Santa Cruz. It was also supported in part by a
Special Research Grant from the Academic Senate Committee on Research
at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
     Finally, all love to Jim, my daughter Anicia, and her partner Steve for
their constant support, patience, and enthusiasm. This book, which is for the
next generations of speakers of Chamorro, is also for them.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"

22.4    Wh-agreement and complementizer agreementWhen an interrogative word or phrase is placed at the left edge of the
question by wh-movement, information about the displaced constituent is
registered elsewhere by two special types of agreement, which are called
wh-agreement and complementizer agreement (see Chung 1998 and the ref-
erences cited there). Wh-agreement, which is described in 22.4.1, registers
the grammatical relation of the displaced constituent on the predicate.
Complementizer agreement, which is described in 22.4.2, registers other
information about the displaced constituent on the complementizer of the
question. Although the discussion here is limited to questions, these dis-
tinctive types of agreement are also found in the focus construction and in
relative clauses (see Chapters 23 and 24).","[520, 521]"

9INDEFINITE PRONOUNS
        Chamorro has general indefinites—indefinite forms similar
        to pronouns that serve as noun phrases or determiners, but
        only in certain constructions. General indefinites serve as
        interrogative words in constituent questions and as negative
        indefinites in negative sentences. Noun phrase ellipsis and
        implicit arguments are also used to convey the meaning of
        indefinite pronouns.","[214, 215, 216]"
"22.3.2 Questions of arguments
Interrogative words or phrases can serve as arguments, or parts of argu-
ments, of the predicate. Specifically, they can serve as subjects, direct
objects, or obliques associated with a verb or adjective, or as subjects of a
predicate that is a noun or preposition. These interrogative words or phrases
differ from other arguments in that they do not follow the predicate, but
instead occur at the left edge of the question. Their location is determined by
their interrogative status, in other words. The discussion here assumes that
they are displaced to the left edge of the question by wh-movement.
     When a noun phrase is displaced by wh-movement, it appears in the
unmarked case, even if it would have been in some other case if wh-move-
ment had not occurred. Consider the questions in (8) below, which have an
interrogative word that is a noun phrase. In (8a-b), the interrogative word is
a subject; in (8c), a passive agent; and in (8d), an oblique argument that
specifies location. Even though passive agents are normally in the oblique
case (see 5.1.2.2) and noun phrases that specify location are normally in the
local case (see 5.1.2.3), all these interrogative words are in the unmarked
case.(8) a.   Håyi fafa’tinas           guini na guma’?

         ‘Who is the cook in this house?’ (CD, entry for fáfa’tinas)
      b. Håfa sumatba              hamyu gi durantin         i gera?

low a noun phrase to be marked for the local case even when it is displaced492
                                                                      Questions
by wh-movement. For these speakers, a noun phrase that would normally be
in the local case, such as håyi ‘who’ in (9), can appear either in the un-
marked case or the local case when it is displaced.","[517, 518]"

        AGR.want     FUT      AGR AGR.sing
        ‘We (excl.) are afraid that they might want to sing at the ceremony.’23.6    Syntactic focus, constituent questions, and cleftsWhen the focus construction is embedded in an argument clause, the focused
constituent is introduced by an overt complementizer and can be followed by
a complementizer that realizes complementizer agreement (see 23.5.1). One
way of handling this pattern would be to treat the focus construction itself as
a type of complex sentence. Suppose that the focused constituent was not
displaced by wh-movement, but was instead a higher predicate whose sub-
ject was an embedded clause—perhaps a relative clause with a null head.
Then a focus construction like (33) would be a cleft sentence, similar to ‘It
was me that led the novena’ or ‘The one who led the novena was me.’(33)    Guåhu tumutucha                        i nubena.
        I         WH[SBJ].lead.prayer.PROG     the novena
        ‘I led the novena prayer.’ (CD, entry for tucha)This analysis could be extended to constituent questions in which the inter-
rogative word or phrase is an argument or adjunct. Then a question like (34)
would also be a cleft sentence, similar to ‘Who is it that is supporting this
political party?’ or ‘Who is the one who is supporting this political party?’(34)    Håyi gumugu’ut                     esti na pattida?
        who? WH[SBJ].support.PROG this L political.party
        ‘Who is supporting this political party?’ (CD, entry for gu’ut)
                                                                           529
    Analyses that treat syntactic focus and constituent questions as complex
sentences—usually cleft sentences—have been motivated for Tagalog,
Māori, and other Austronesian languages (see e.g. Bauer 1991 on Māori and
Potsdam 2006 on Malagasy). In Chamorro, a complex sentence analysis is
plausible for some instances of these constructions. The most likely analysis
of the constituent question in (35), for instance, is that the interrogative
phrase is the predicate and the noun phrase following it—which trans-
parently contains a relative clause—is the subject.","[554, 555]"
"                                                                            497

         ‘Who is most familiar with the woods in this area?’ (CD, entry for

      c. Håyi sinaolak            as Jose?
         who? AGR.PASS.spank OBL Jose
         ‘Who was spanked by Jose?’ (CD, entry for sinaolak)
      d. Håyi manggubiebietna              guini gi islan       Tinian?
         who? AGR.ANTIP.govern.PROG LCL.this LCL island.L Tinian
         ‘Who is governing here on the island of Tinian?’ (CD, entry for
         gubietna)Similarly, the displaced constituent in the constituent questions in (19) is a
subject, but these questions are in the irrealis mood. Once again, wh-agree-
ment is not realized overtly, and the predicate shows normal agreement with
the subject.(19) a.  Håyi para       u hånåo kuentåk-ku?
         who? FUT        AGR go        account-AGR
         ‘Who will go on my behalf?’ (CD, entry for u)
      b. Håyi para       u yaka’ esti na titiyas?
         who? FUT        AGR knead this L      tortillas
         ‘Who will knead these tortillas?’ (CD, entry for yaka’)     Many Chamorro speakers prefer not to question the subject of a tran-
sitive verb in the irrealis mood, especially when the direct object is animate.
Such questions are typically expressed as questions of the agent of the
corresponding passive verb, as in (20) (see Chung 1989). Wh-agreement
with a displaced passive agent is not realized overtly, so once again, the
predicate shows normal agreement with the subject.(20) a.   Håyi para       u faninatan            i famagu’un mientras
          who? FUT        AGR AGR.PASS.watch the PL.child        while

       ‘Who is going to take the victory (lit. by whom is the victory going
       to be taken) in the election?’ (CD, entry for ginanna)22.4.1.2     With an object
Object wh-agreement registers the grammatical relation of a displaced con-
stituent that is a direct object or related to a direct object, as described
below. This form of wh-agreement is also sensitive to transitivity. It is re-
alized, optionally, as the combination of the infix -in- plus nominalization
when the displaced constituent is the direct object of an ordinary transitive
verb. Compare (21a), which illustrates the overt form, with (21b), which
shows that this form is optional.(21) a.Ya          håfa    hinaso-mu              put     i
       and.then    what? WH[OBJ].remember-AGR about the
       eskuelan-ñiha i Chapanis?
       school-AGR      the Japanese
       ‘And what do you remember about the Japanese school?’ (MM 167)
    b. Håfa un hasu            put    i gera?
       what? AGR remember about the war
       ‘What do you remember about the war?’ (MM 192)    Object wh-agreement has the same optional realization in two other
contexts. First, when the displaced constituent is the direct object of a caus-
ative verb. This is expected, since causative verbs are transitive (see 12.1).(22) a.Håyi nina’kati-mu?
       who? WH[OBJ].make.cry-AGR
       ‘Who did you make cry?’
    b. Håyi un na’kåti?
       who? AGR make.cry
       ‘Who did you make cry?’Second, when the displaced constituent is the oblique object of an appli-
cative or causative verb; that is, when it realizes the internal argument of the
original transitive verb from which the applicative or causative is derived
(see 11.3.2.3, 11.5, and 12.3.4.2). The displaced constituent is the oblique
object of an applicative verb in (23) and the oblique object of a causative
verb in (24).","[522, 523, 524]"
"
                                                                            241
since applicatives derived from transitive verbs can occur in the antipassive
under some circumstances (see 11.3.2.3).
     (ii) In Chamorro, when an argument of the verb is questioned, rela-
tivized, or syntactically focused, the verb shows wh-agreement (see 22.4.1).
This special agreement, which replaces the normal agreement with the
subject, registers the grammatical relation of the constituent that has been
questioned, relativized, or focused—henceforth, the displaced constituent.
For instance, when the displaced constituent is the subject of a transitive
verb in the realis mood, the verb shows the subject form of wh-agreement,
which is realized as the infix -um-. When the displaced constituent is the
direct object, the verb optionally shows the object form of wh-agreement,
which is realized as the infix -in- plus nominalization of the verb.
     Like other transitive verbs in the realis mood, an applicative shows the
subject form of wh-agreement when the displaced constituent is the subject.
This can be seen from the constituent questions in (15).(15) a.  Håyi chumatgi           håo?
         who? WH[SBJ].laugh.at   you
         ‘Who laughed at you?’

the displaced constituent is its direct object. Compare the ungrammatical
questions in (16) with their grammatical counterparts in (17), which show
the ordinary forms of agreement with the subject.(16) a. *Håyi chinatgem-mu / chinatgi-mu?

Just as with the ungrammatical antipassives that were mentioned earlier,
speakers do not recognize the verbs with object wh-agreement in (16) as
legitimate verb forms of the language.
     This generalization has a handful of exceptions. For instance, the
applicative tattiyi ‘follow’ (from tåtti ‘behind’) can show the object form of
wh-agreement, as in (18).4(18)    Håyi tinattiyin-ñiñiha?
        who? WH[OBJ].follow- AGR.PROG
        ‘Who are they following?’But overall, applicatives derived from intransitive predicates cannot show
wh-agreement with their direct object. It is unclear why this should be.","[266, 267, 268]"
"9.1     OverviewAlthough Chamorro has no set of indefinite pronouns, it has indefinite forms
that serve some of the same functions. These forms, which are called gen-
eral indefinites here, occur only in constituent questions, negative sentences,
and certain other constructions. They do not occur in sentences that describe
single, one-time events that occurred or are occurring. The meaning of an
indefinite pronoun can also be conveyed by noun phrase ellipsis in
existential sentences, and by implicit arguments in other constructions. The
form, meaning, and uses of general indefinites are documented in 9.2. Then,
other mechanisms that can be used to convey the meaning of indefinite
pronouns are described in 9.3.",[216]

           ‘It was just the pumpkin plant that the old lady didn’t use, because
           she didn’t know what this food was.’ (Mannge’ 2)      However, the progressive has some more specialized uses in negative
clauses. The progressive is often used in negative clauses when an event or
state no longer holds, meaning that it does not hold at the time in question,
but had held previously. These negative clauses often include the adverb
esta ‘already’.(27) a.   Esta      i neni       ti tumåtangis.

       c. Ti u’uchan.

          ‘It is no longer raining.’     Similarly, the progressive is often used in negative clauses when an
event or state does not yet hold, meaning that it does not hold at the time in
question, but is expected to hold later. These negative clauses often include
the adverb trabiha ‘still, yet’.(28) a.   Trabiha ti hu tataitai         i lepblu ni          ha nå’i      yu’.

          ‘It wasn’t yet time.’ (EM 93)      Finally, the progressive is normally used in negative imperatives
formed with the negative verb cha’- ‘better not’, which shows agreement
like a noun (see 15.2.2.2).","[43, 44]"
"22.4.1.1       With a subject
Subject wh-agreement registers the grammatical relation of a displaced con-
stituent that is a subject. This form of wh-agreement is sensitive to mood and
transitivity. It is realized as the infix -um- when the predicate is a transitive
verb in the realis mood. (Predicates that show an overt form of wh-agree-
ment appear in boldface in the questions below.)(17) a.   Håyi gumugu’ut                    esti na pattida?

          who? L person WH[SBJ].know what? AGR.PASS.experience
          ‘What person knows what happened?’ (CD, entry for pitsona)     Otherwise, subject wh-agreement has no overt realization. The displaced
constituent in the questions in (18) is a subject, but the predicate is intran-
sitive: a verb in (18a), an adjective in (18b), a passive verb in (18c), and an
antipassive verb in (18d). Because wh-agreement is not realized overtly, the
predicate shows normal agreement with the subject.",[522]

         ‘Where do the land slugs come from?’ (CD, entry for sålang)    Finally, Chamorro has a small number of phonologically dependent
verbs that must lean on material to their right to form a phonological word
(see 2.2.1.1.2). One such verb is the phonologically dependent verb malak
‘go to’. Malak can combine with a goal argument that is an interrogative
word, as in (7). When that happens, the two form a single phonological
word, although this is not reflected in the orthographies.5(7)       Manmalak månu hamyu anai             matututuhun           i

          war
          ‘Where did you (pl.) go when the war was beginning?’ (MM 109)     These types of constituent questions are quite common. In all of them,
the interrogative word occurs ‘in place’ (in situ), meaning that its location is
determined by its function as the predicate, or by its syntactic category, not
by its status as an interrogative word. The interrogative words in (5) occur in
the same location as other predicates, at the beginning of the clause. The
interrogative words in (6) and (7) occur in positions normally occupied by
other noun phrases (see (6d) and (7)) or other determiners (6a-c). (The same
positions can be occupied by demonstratives, such as atyu ‘that (near third5
  Although the verbs of possession, gai ‘have’ and tai ‘not have’, are phonol-
ogically dependent, they cannot combine with an interrogative word. This is
because gai and tai must combine with a head noun (see 14.3), but no
interrogative words are nouns. (Instead, they are general indefinites, which
could be considered a type of pronoun.)
                                                                                491
person)’, for instance; see 6.2.2.) The fact that the interrogative word occurs
in situ distinguishes questions of the predicate from other types of constit-
uent questions.","[515, 516, 517]"

22.4.2 Complementizer agreement
Complementizer agreement uses the complementizer of the constituent
question to register information about the displaced constituent’s syntactic
category and meaning. This agreement replaces the normal finite comple-
mentizer, if any, with a special form of the complementizer that follows the
displaced constituent, and is sometimes overt and other times null. The
special complementizer has three overt realizations, na, nai, and ni, whose
use is subject to some regional and individual variation. (The realizations are
different in most relative clauses; see 24.3.2 and 24.4.) One realization, na,
looks like the complementizer for finite embedded clauses (see 20.2.1); the
other realizations apparently do not occur outside complementizer agree-
ment. Na is used most commonly in Guam, nai in Rota, and ni in Saipan, but
many speakers choose freely among several of these forms. The key contrast
is between the overt realizations and the null realization (abbreviated ‘null
COMP’ in (31)). The forms of complementizer agreement are listed below.","[527, 528]"

"23.1     OverviewChamorro has several ways of signaling focus; that is, indicating that the
information conveyed by a word or phrase is contrastive (singled out from a
set of alternatives) or contrary to expectations. The focused word or phrase
can be marked with a focus morpheme, such as the emphatic particle ha’, or
it can be syntactically focused—displaced to the left edge of the sentence by
wh-movement in the focus construction. When wh-movement occurs, wh-
agreement and complementizer agreement are used to register information
about the displaced constituent.
     23.2 describes the emphatic particle ha’ and its distribution. The rest of
this chapter is devoted to syntactic focus. 23.3 introduces the focus construc-
tion and the types of constituents that can be syntactically focused. 23.4

the focus construction when the passive verb is irrealis and the passive agent

passive agent is not questioned, relativized, or syntactically focused), then:
    (iii) The ma-passive is used when the passive agent is higher in animacy
than the subject. This happens, for instance, when the passive agent is hu-
man but the subject is inanimate.(24) a.   Manachagu’    nifin    i hagå-hu            ya          para

names a child.
     Finally, if none of (i-iii) is relevant, then:
     (iv) The -in-passive is used when the passive agent is singular, and the
ma-passive is used when the passive agent is dual/plural or unknown.
     Practically speaking, the result is that the choice between -in- and ma- is
usually determined by the number of the passive agent. Some examples of
clauses with a singular passive agent are given below (see also 10.2.2.1).
Note that it does not matter whether the passive agent is animate (see (25a))
or inanimate (25b).","[245, 246]"

20.4.1 Introduced by a complementizer
Finite embedded clauses introduced by a complementizer can serve as ad-
verbial clauses, although their functions as adverbial clauses are rather
limited.
    Embedded clauses introduced by the complementizer kåo can be used as
adverbial clauses that specify purpose. In such cases, the purpose of the
event described by the main clause is to resolve the issue described by the
adverbial clause. In (22a), for instance, the purpose of the speaker’s smelling
the meat is to resolve the issue of whether the meat is rotten; in (22b), the
purpose of the addressee’s looking at the carpenter’s level is to resolve the
issue of whether the shelf is straight. Kåo in these adverbial clauses cor-
responds roughly to ‘to see whether’.(22) a.   Hu ngingi’ i katni [kåo              båba         esta].
           AGR sniff    the meat Q             AGR.bad      already
          ‘I smelled the meat to see whether it is already rotten.’ (CD, entry
          for ngingi’)
       b. Atan i mubet [kåo               esta     tunas              i istånti].
          look.at the level     Q         already AGR.straight       the shelf
          ‘Look at the level and see if the shelf is straight.’ (CD, entry for
          mubét)
       c. Chagi ennåo na sapåtus [kåo              omlat håo].
          try      that     L   shoes Q            AGR.fit you
          ‘Try those shoes to see whether you fit them.’Note that embedded polar questions can be used as adverbial clauses, but
constituent questions cannot be. (Constituent questions usually are not intro-
duced by kåo; see 22.3.)(23)       *Atan i lamasa [håfa na nengkanu’ manmakånnu’].
           look.at the table what? L food                 AGR.PASS.eat
           (‘Look at the table to see what foods have been eaten.’)     Embedded clauses introduced by na can be used as adverbial clauses
that specify result or purpose. Na in these adverbial clauses roughly cor-
responds to ‘such that’ (if the embedded clause is realis) or ‘so that, in order
to’ (if the embedded clause is irrealis). As usual, na can be omitted when it
comes immediately before the TAM para ‘future, subjunctive’, as in (24c)
(see 20.2.1).","[466, 467]"
"20.3.1 Basics
Recall (from 3.1) that the predicate dictates the structure and function of its
arguments, including their grammatical relations. In line with this, the pred-
icate determines whether any of its arguments can be an embedded clause.
Consider the verb disidi ‘decide’, which has two arguments: one argument
that names the one who does the deciding, and another argument that names
what is decided. The argument that names what is decided can be a noun
phrase (as in (9a)), or an embedded clause (9b).(9) a.   Siña      ha’     ma disidi i difirensian-ñiha sin             mumu.
         can       EMP     AGR decide the difference-AGR without fight
         ‘They were able to settle (lit. decide) their difference without a
         fight.’ (CD, entry for difirensia)
      b. I amun            ennåo na tintågu’           para     u disidi
         the master.L      that      L   servant       FUT      AGR decide

         Q         AGR.good     or not AGR.good work-AGR
         ‘The master of that servant will decide whether his work was good
         or bad.’ (NT 292)    Predicates that have an argument that is an embedded clause can also
dictate whether that clause expresses a question or a statement. Argument
clauses that express questions either are introduced by the complementizer
kåo, as in (9b), or else are constituent questions (see 22.3). Argument
clauses that express statements are introduced by the complementizer na,
which is not pronounced in some contexts (see 20.2.1). Some examples are
given in (10).3(10) a.   Annuk        ha’     [na      guaha       sinientem-mu
          AGR.appear EMP       COMP     AGR.exist   WH[OBJ].feel-AGR3
 In addition, the predicate can dictate whether an argument clause is finite
or nonfinite (see Chapter 21).",[459]
"(15)      Manmantika       i [kininne’-ña        na haiting    si

          Luis
          ‘The bigeye scad that Luis caught are very fatty.’ (CD, entry for
          haiting)However, Vincent (2017) observes that when the head noun occurs inside
the relative clause, it cannot be preceded by an overt determiner, but—
surprisingly—is marked with the pre-head form of the linker. He proposes
that in such cases, the gap is a missing determiner associated with the head
noun—a determiner whose presence is signaled by the pre-head form of the
linker.
     With this in place, it becomes clear that gaps in relative clauses have the
same overall distribution as noun phrases, and parts of noun phrases, that
can be displaced by wh-movement. For instance, interrogative noun phrases
are displaced by wh-movement in constituent questions when they serve as
arguments or adjuncts, but not when they serve as the predicate (see 22.3).
The same is true of syntactically focused noun phrases that are displaced by
wh-movement in the focus construction (see 23.2 and 23.3). The noun
phrases that are displaced can be subjects, direct objects, or obliques, but not
objects of prepositions.2 They can be possessors as long as the possessed2
  Prepositional phrases can be displaced by wh-movement in questions and
in the focus construction, but the gap in relative clauses must be a noun
phrase; it cannot be a prepositional phrase.",[565]

It also includes infinitive clauses formed from transitive verbs, which show
the infinitival agreement infix -um-. (Infinitive clauses must have a missing

tion in (13) is a pronoun that must be null; see 21.4.)(13)       Ha chagi     si        Pai’     umaligåo håo gi giput.
           AGR try      UNM       Pai’     INF.look.for you LCL party
           ‘Pai’ tried to look for you at the party.’    Finally, the restriction has no impact on clauses in which the verb shows
an overt form of wh-agreement, since overt wh-agreement supersedes the
normal agreement with the subject (see 22.4.1). Consider the constituent
questions and the focus construction in (14). The verb in these sentences
shows the subject form of wh-agreement, which is realized as the infix -um-.(14) a.   Håyi kumestiona                håo?

         ‘John got dirt (for someone).’      Nonetheless, antipassive clauses seem to be more tightly constrained
when they are formed from applicatives than when they are formed from
ordinary transitive verbs. The applicative verbs that are known to occur in
the antipassive are among the most common -i applicatives. Whether the
pattern exends to less frequent -i applicatives, or to applicatives formed with
-guan, -iyi, or -ñaihun, is not yet known. Gibson (180: 165) observes that
antipassive clauses formed from applicatives require the applicative object
(i.e. the goal or beneficiary) to be implicit. This requirement may well be the
default, although there are speakers who are comfortable violating it. It is
unclear what is responsible for these patterns.
      (ii) Applicatives derived from transitive verbs show wh-agreement in
questions, relative clauses, and the focus construction, but not when the dis-
placed constituent is the applicative object. In this respect, they behave like
applicatives derived from intransitive predicates. Consider the question in
(33a) and the focus construction in (33b), both of which are in the realis
mood. Here, the displaced constituent is the subject, and the applicative
shows the subject form of wh-agreement.(33) a.  Håyi sumangåni            hamyu para      en suhåyi           i

cative cannot show the object form of wh-agreement.","[274, 275]"

           ‘You often came here before, now you seldom come.’ (CD, entry
           for ekalak)     Manner, too, is typically conveyed through sentence types in which the
predicate is an adjective. In such constructions, information about the situ-
ation under discussion is supplied by an infinitive clause or complex noun
phrase that serves as an argument of the adjective. The sentences below can
be translated ‘Warships are fast to travel in the ocean’ (see (49a)), ‘The way
he was injured was very bad’ (49b), and ‘Why was the way she did it like
that?’ (49c).(49) a.   I batkun gera         siha     manchaddik       manhånåo gi tasi.

          ‘Why did she do it like that?’ (EM 94)Notice that in (49a), the adjective chaddik ‘fast’ agrees with the subject. The
agreement reveals that chaddik is the predicate of the clause, and not an
adverb. (Compare (41b), where chaddik serves as an adverb.) The adjec-
tives båba ‘bad’ in (49b) and taiguennåo ‘like that’ in (49c) likewise agree
with the subject, but that agreement is not realized by any special mor-
phology (see 2.2.2.2.1).
     The fact that these constructions occur frequently in Chamorro may be
related to lexical resources: as mentioned in Chapter 18, the language has no
productive means of deriving adverbs from other parts of speech. (See also
14.2.2 on existential clauses, Chapter 21 on infinitive clauses, and Chapter
24 on relative clauses.)

The questions in (38) reveal that the object form of wh-agreement is realized
optionally, just as it is more generally.(38) a.  Håfa si          Juan     ha sangåni si     Maria?

         ‘Just remember what they were told.’In other words, it is possible for applicatives derived from transitive verbs to
show the object form of wh-agreement when the displaced constituent is the
original verb’s internal argument, but not when it is the applicative object.
    The range of applicatives that exhibit this pattern is not yet known. It is
clear from speakers’ judgments and from naturally-occurring data that one
such applicative is sangåni ‘say to’. For some speakers, but not all, the
pattern extends to other applicatives, particularly when the additional argu-
ment is a goal or recipient. The pattern is even more robust for concealed
applicatives (see 11.5).","[276, 277]"

24.3.1 Wh-agreement
Wh-agreement in relative clauses registers the grammatical relation of the
gap on the predicate associated with it. This special agreement signals
whether the gap is a subject, object, oblique, or adjunct. Like subject-verb
agreement, wh-agreement appears only on verbs or adjectives, and is
sensitive to mood and transitivity. The overt forms of wh-agreement replace
the normal forms of subject-verb agreement. Otherwise, if wh-agreement is
not realized overtly, the verb or adjective is inflected for subject-verb
agreement as usual.
    Wh-agreement has the same overt forms in relative clauses as it does in
constituent questions and the focus construction (see 22.4.1 and 23.4.1).
However, some overt forms of agreement that are obligatory in questions
and the focus construction are merely optional in relative clauses.
    Wh-agreement with a subject gap is realized as -um-, but only
optionally, when the predicate is a transitive verb in the realis mood; see
(16a-b). (This overt realization of wh-agreement is obligatory in questions
and the focus construction.) Otherwise, wh-agreement with a subject gap has
no overt realization, as (16c) shows.(16) a.   Manlibri    yan      ma li’i’     i [hagas           pumoksai

         ‘Don’t give something that is not well-received.’ (CD, entry for

bination of -in- plus nominalization when the gap is the direct object of an
ordinary transitive verb (see (17a-b)). The realization is the same when the
gap is the oblique object of an applicative or passive verb, except that -in- is
omitted when the verb is passive (17c-d). (See 22.4.1.2 on the realization of
wh-agreement with other types of objects.)542

no overt realization otherwise (19b).(19) a.    Måolik     i Lai yanggin ma’usa                  gi [diputsi

         ‘He stayed in that place where he and the turtle had met.’ (from a
         tape-recorded narrative)     The examples above illustrate the pattern of wh-agreement in relative
clauses that precede or follow the head noun, or whose head noun is not
overt. Wh-agreement also occurs in relative clauses that surround the head
noun, when the gap is a missing determiner (see 24.2.2). Then the agreement
registers the grammatical relation of the noun phrase associated with the
missing determiner—the noun phrase whose head noun remains in place
inside the relative clause. In (4c-d), for instance, the gap is the missing
determiner of the direct object, so the verb of the relative clause shows (the
overt form) of object wh-agreement. The pattern is the same when an
interrogative determiner is displaced in constituent questions (see 22.3.2)
and—presumably—when a syntactically focused determiner is displaced in
the focus construction.","[566, 567, 568, 569]"

the displaced interrogative word or phrase in a constituent question. The
assumption here is that syntactically focused constituents, like interrogative
words or phrases, are displaced to the left edge of the sentence by wh-
movement (see 23.6).
     Sentences with a syntactically focused constituent share many char-
acteristics with constituent questions formed by wh-movement—so much so
that one might be tempted to treat constituent questions as a subtype of focus
construction. At the same time, the two constructions differ in certain
details.
     A much wider range of noun phrases can be displaced by wh-movement
in the focus construction than in constituent questions (see 22.3.2 and
22.3.3). Syntactically focused noun phrases can be definite, indefinite, or
quantified, as illustrated below (with the focused noun phrase in boldface).(8) a.   I guella             ha’ gi bandan nanå-hu            hu fakcha’i.

         ‘Only my grandmother from my mom’s side I saw.’ (CD, entry for

The head of a focused noun phrase can be a common noun (as in (8a-b) and
(8d)), a name (9a), or an independent pronoun (9b).(9) a.     Si     Juan dumoti               i tanu’ giya           Langa’sat.
           UNM    Juan WH[SBJ].inherit the land           LCL      Langa’sat
          ‘John inherited the land at Langa’sat.’ (CD, entry for doti)
       b. Hågu abok-ku.
          you     pal-AGR
          ‘You are my pal.’ (CD, entry for abuk)     In other respects, syntactically focused constituents have the same dis-
tribution as displaced interrogative words and phrases. They can serve as
arguments of the predicate: as subjects, direct objects, or obliques associated
with a verb or adjective, or as subjects of a predicate that is a noun or prep-
osition. They can also serve as parts of arguments, or as adjuncts, but not as
the predicate. In addition:
     Like displaced interrogative noun phrases (see 22.3.2), syntactically
focused noun phrases appear in the unmarked case, even if they would have
occurred in some other case if they had not been displaced by wh-move-
ment. For instance, passive agents are normally in the oblique case, and
noun phrases that specify location in time are normally in the local case.
Nonetheless, these noun phrases appear in the unmarked case when they are
syntacically focused, as (10) shows.(10)a.     Kåo     i pulusia pat si         tatan-ñiha para       u
          Q        the police or UNM        father-AGR FUT        AGR
          faninaligåo?
          AGR.PASS.look.for
          ‘Are they going to be looked for by the police or by their father?’
       b. I mit             nuebi sientus        nubenta      na såkkan
          the thousand nine         hundreds ninety           L   year

          COMP AGR.born         I
          ‘I was born in the year 1990.’ (CD, entry for nubenta)    This generalization has an exception: some speakers of the Saipan
dialect allow a noun phrase to appear the local case even when it is
syntactically focused. Compare (10b) with the following.","[541, 542, 543]"
