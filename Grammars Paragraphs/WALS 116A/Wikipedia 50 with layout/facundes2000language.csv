6.7.2       Subordinator Particle         There is also one clear case of a subordinator particle, which is kotxi (or kota, dependingon speech variety) ‘because’, as the example in (35) illustrates. The syntactic properties of thissubordinator are presented in chapter 9, in subsection 9.1.3.1.
 35. nu-su-pe-ka-ko                  kotxi nu-sãpaka
     1SG-go-PFTV-PRED-FUT because 1SG-be.tired
     ‘I’ll get going because I’m tired.’6.7.3 Polarity Particles: Negative, Positive         The polarity particles are simply the word forms used to answer polar questions. Theyare kona ‘not, no’ and aru1 ‘yes’. As suggested by the gloss, the negative particle kona can beused as the answer to polar questions and, also, it can negate phrasal expressions. This, however,is only part of the syntactic functions of polarity particles. The negative particle can be usedmore than as an answer to polar questions, and its functions and scope are described in detail inthe context of simplex clauses in the chapter 8, in 8.7.",[402]
"8.8.2.1          Polar (Yes/No) Questions            Polar questions are used to seek “a comment on the degree of truth of thequestioned proposition” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:179), normally elicit as answers thepositive or negative polarity particles aru ‘yes’ or kona ‘no’ (described in 6.7.3), and areonly marked prosodically by the rising intonation. This conventionalized use of risingintonation to mark polar questions can, nevertheless, be characterized as agrammaticalized property of interrogative sentences. In (112), the first two examples(112a-b) illustrate polar questions for clauses with transitive verbs, and the two lastexamples (112c-d) illustrate polar questions for clauses with intransitive verbs. In all ofthese examples, the only element that distinguishes the interrogative clauses from theirdeclarative counterpart is the rising intonation:22          s-V-o                     O
     112a. p-oka-pe-ru            ãkiti?
          2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
          ‘Have you killed the jaguar yet?’
           s-V-o                       O
        b. pi-keta-ru                ãkiti?
           2SG-shoot-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
           ‘Did you shoot the jaguar?’
22
     I have only recently attested that the speech variety of the Fortaleza village has the morphema –ta, used in the verb
     base to mark polar questions. The equivalent of the sentence in (112b) in this speech community will be
     pi-keta-ta-ru ãkiti ‘Did you shoot the jaguar?’. This same morpheme is not present in the speech of the Japiim
     village.",[567]
"            As already mentioned in 6.7.3, kona is also the form normally used as the shortest(linguistic) answer to a polar question, in the role of counterpart of the positive polarityparticle aru. Furthermore, in some speech varieties (for example, the one spoken in thenorthern-most village, i.e. Jatuarana) the negative can undergo extreme phonologicalshortening. As shown in (110), kona can be shortened to /a/ before a consonant-initialword or to /n/ before a vowel-initial word:20
      NEG#s-V
 110a. a#n-ayata-panhi
      NEG#hunt-IMPFTV
      ‘I’m not going to go hunt.’
20
     In these speech varieties, sometimes kona is reduced to just nasalization in fast speech rates.",[563]

8.8.2.2      Information Questions          Generally speaking, information questions (also known as WH questions) “areused typically when the speaker and the hearer share the knowledge of a proposition —itis presupposed or backgrounded —but the speaker does not know one element in theproposition” (Givón 1990:2.793). As seen in the next subsections, various elements in asentence can be questioned. The major elements within a sentence that can be questionedusing a set of systematic question forms include subject/object, place, time, reason andmanner. The interrogative words are always sentence-initial.","[567, 568]"
"         In addition to the morphological criteria described above there are at least threesyntactic criteria that can also be used to define a grammatical word. The first of them isthat some grammatical words are generally permutable with one another. This can beillustrated with the same examples that were given in (1c, d) to illustrate the pausephenomenon, where watxa and nu-su-pe-ka-ko alternate positions. The second syntacticcriterion is based on the distribution of the word: A grammatical word can generally beinserted between two other words. This can be seen by contrasting (5) and (6); in the latterexample the word form owa-kata ‘with her’ is inserted between two grammatical words:
6. uwa   owa-kata    muteka-nanu-ta                     ‘He was running with her.’

                                                 125
        The third syntactic criterion used to distinguish grammatical words in Apurinã is thata grammatical word is the “minimal free word form”, i.e., “[it] is the smallest unit that canexist on its own” (Spencer 1992:43). This criterion can be illustrated in Apurinã as apossible answer to what probably is the question I have asked most often in Apurinã. Thequestion is as given in (7a), and the relevant type of answer to this question is illustrated in(7b):
7a. kanhipa nhi-txa-ru            “man”?            ‘How do I say “man”?’
    how     1SG-say-3M.Ob. kuku                                             ‘man’
   man
Notice that, unless the speakers are properly trained in linguistic methodology, they will notbe able to answer satisfactorily a question such as “How do I say a plural masculinemarker?”. Here is one clear instance where speakers clearly distinguish words from theirinternal components (introduced later in this section and in the other chapters).","[156, 157]"
"
8.8.2 Interrogative Speech Acts       Interrogative speech acts are conventionally used to seek information, and theycan be divided in two major types: polar questions and information questions. Asidefrom the formal differences described in the following subsections, polar and informationquestions differ in that the former are marked by a rising intonation.",[566]
"8.8.2.2.2      Questioning Time       In order to question time the TEMPORAL bound form -sawaku is added as partof ke-pa subject/object interrogative word form, following the gender marker -ru, as thefollowing example illustrates:
 116a. ke-ru-sawaku-pa       p-oka-pe-ru  ãkiti?
       WH-3M-TEMP-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
       ‘When have you killed the jaguar?’
8.8.2.2.3      Questioning Reason       In questioning reasons it is the noun form nere ‘will, volition’ that is added as partof the subject/object interrogative word form, as the following examples illustrate:
 117a. ke-nere-pa    kariwa        i-txa-pẽ-ka-wa?
       WH-will-INT white.person be-PFTV-PASS-REFL
       ‘Why has he become a white person?’    b. ke-nere-pa    p-oka-pe-ru         ãkiti?
       WH-will-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
       ‘Why have you killed the jaguar?’
8.8.2.2.4      Questioning Place       In order to question places the interrogative word form nhã-pa (or yã-pa,depending on speech variety) is used. The place interrogative word can occur by itself                                                539
introducing an interrogative sentence questioning a place, as illustrated in (118a), or itcan have a pronominal bound form or the GOAL postpositional marker added into theinterrogative word form, as the examples in (118b-c), respectively, illustrate:
 118a. nhã-pa        p-oka-pe-ru        ãkiti?
       PLACE-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
       ‘Where did you kill the jaguar?’    b. nhã-õ-pa         o-su-pe-ru?
       PLACE-3F-INT 3F-go-PFTV-3M.O
       ‘Where has she gone?’    c. nha-monhi-pa         p-oka-pe-ru    ãkiti?
       PLACE-GOAL-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
       ‘Where have you killed the jaguar?’
       There is also an unrelated form that is used to question places, namely atapa-ru(or ĩtepa-ru, depending on the speech variety). This second interrogative word form forplaces does not allow the addition of other forms into it and is generally used in sentenceswith nominal predicates, such as the one illustrated in the next example:
 119. ata-pa-ru         ãkiti?
      PLACE-INT-3M jaguar
      ‘Where is the jaguar?’
8.8.2.2.5      Questioning Manner       In order to question manner, the manner interrogative word kanhi-pa is used. Themanner interrogative word does not allow the addition of other forms into it. Thefollowing examples are instances of kanhi-pa being used to introduce interrogativesentences questioning manner:
                                                540
 120a. kanhi-pa         o-txa?

        MANNER-INT 2SG-do-PFTV
        ‘How did you do (it)?’
          For interrogative sentences questioning manner there is also an unrelated formthat can be used, in addition to kanhi-pa, namely natoko-pa, as the following exampledemonstrates. This second manner interrogative word also does not allow the addition ofother forms into it.
 121. natoko-pa        p-oka-pe-ru             ãkiti?
      MANNER-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
      ‘In which way have you killed the jaguar?’8.8.2.3      Indirect Content Questions          Indirect questions (or dependent interrogatives or embedded-WH questions,(Sadock and Zwicky 1985:186 and Givón 1990:2.804-806) consist of interrogativeclauses whose verbs take an information question as complement. Examples of suchverbs may include ‘ask’, ‘know’, and ‘announce’. Different from languages like Englishand Portuguese, however, Apurinã does not make use of interrogative words in indirectquestion. Instead, indirect questions use the same formal device of relative clauses(described in detail in the next chapter, subsection 9.1.1), as illustrated in (122).

8.8.3 Imperative Speech Acts       Imperative speech acts consists of “syntactic forms that explicitly convey somesubset of requests/commands/orders/suggestions/instructions/entreaties, and so on”(Sadock and Zwicky 1985:170). Pickering (1971:28) lists various forms as markingsubsets of “imperative verbs”. However, commands, requests and instructions take nospecial markers in the spontaneous discourse of any the speech varieties I have observed.","[570, 571, 572, 573]"

       No single property in (9) is used here as a necessary and sufficient condition for theidentification of a formative; rather, the list constitutes a range of properties commonlyassociated with formatives that can be analyzed as morphemes or allomorphs or emptymorphs. When used in combination these properties will serve as a set of procedures toidentify not only the general morphological unit formative (as opposed to morphologicallyinconsequent phonological chunks), but also the sub-type of formative in question, i.e.allomorph, morpheme or empty morph. The data to be represented in chapters 4-7 willprovide examples where some of the decisions on whether a formative constitutes amorpheme or not will be, ultimately, a theory-driven judgment. However, the propertieslisted in (9) will (hopefully) provide completely consistent results. Table 1 lists the valuesfor each of the relevant properties that will determine whether a putative formative realizes amorpheme, allomorphs of a single morpheme, or an empty morph, or whether the putativeformative is just a morphologically inconsequent phonological chunk:

Table 1 reads as follows:I- Meaning: Morphemes and allomorphs will normally have a meaning systematically
associated with them, whereas both empty morphs and non-formatives will not;II- Function: Morphemes and allomorphs may have a function associated with them (e.g.
nominalizer, verbalizer, etc.), whereas both empty morphs and non-formatives will not;III- Form: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs will normally have a constant
shape with predictable variations, whereas non-formatives will not;IV- Part of Speech of base (P.O.S.): Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may be
restricted to a specific word category, whereas this may not happen to non-formatives;V- Restrictions on base: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may also be
restricted to bases with specific phonological or semantic properties, whereas this does
not happen to non-formatives;VI- Range of allomorphs: Morphemes and empty morphs may not only exhibit
allomorphic variants, but also different morphemes and different empty morphs may
exhibit distinct allomorphic variants, whereas non-formatives may not exhibit such
variants at all;VII- Form imposed on base: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may cause
systematic changes in the underlying form of a base, whereas non-formatives will not;VIII- Potentiation of other formative: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs may

“create a suitable base for” another formative, whereas non-formatives will not;IX- Degree of productivity: Morphemes and empty morphs may exhibit degrees of
productivity that may be used to distinguish between two morphemes or two empty
morphs, whereas non-formatives may not;X- Position class: Morphemes, their allomorphs, and empty morphs may occupy a
position class in the word it occurs within, whereas non-formatives will not;XI- Complementary distribution: Allomorphs of the same morpheme will always be
mutually exclusive, whereas morphemes, empty morphs or non-formatives will not;XII- Recurrence: Morphemes, allomorphs and empty morphs will recur in the word
bases they are allowed to occur, whereas non-formatives will not;       Therefore the list given in Table 1 works as sort of tests to determine whethersomething is a formative or not, and what type of formative it is. As seen in this table, everypositive value assigned to the category morpheme implies a positive value to the categoryallomorph. This follows from the assumption that every morpheme is necessarily realizedas at least one allomorph. Thus wherever there is a morpheme there will necessarily be atleast one allomorph, whereas the converse does not hold. The application of the tests givenabove will be illustrated as they are applied in chapters 4-6.","[162, 163, 164]"

"       In order to answer question II, we need a more detailed analysis of the semanticfeatures (properties) of CN2s; we need to specify the shape and consistency propertiesinvolved in the mappings posited in Figures (4-6). In order to motivate the properties ofCN2s in terms of image-schematic mappings, we need to specifically describe whichparticular properties are being mapped between domains. That is, it still remains to besaid which of the several different “physical properties of Plant Parts/Nature Elements”are associated to the “physical properties of Body Parts/Manufactured Elements,” and soon. This is what is dealt with in the next paragraphs.",[223]
"       A semantic analysis of the data allows us to make sense out of the descriptivefacts by positing schematic models which would motivate the association of the semanticfields given in (i)-(iii) above. Such an analysis also allows us to note that it is theperceptually salient physical properties inherent to (i) and/or (ii) that are mapped onto (ii)and/or (iii). However, we have only been able to account for the semantic classes whose
                                                 192
properties are associated to one another (through metaphorical mappings), and tomotivate only one very general set of properties involved in the semantic mappings,namely the set of “physical salient properties.” The obvious question then would be“How do we know which properties are salient?” One way to find the answer to thisquestion would be to perform psycholinguistic experimental tests such as those used inPrototype studies à la Rosch 1977. Another possibility would be to use linguisticinformation through a structural analysis of the data. It is the structural analysis thatfollows below.","[223, 224]"
"         Question I could be answered if we made use of the some sort of cultural modeunderlying the use of CN2s. We may take CN1s (i.e. plant parts/nature elements andperhaps body parts) to constitute the set of semantic properties expressing a sourcedomain, whereas CN2 (manufactured elements) would constitute a target domain. Inorder to understand, express or conceptualize elements within the target domain,elements of the source domain are used. The meaning of CN2s would emerge out of themappings between image-schematic models containing “specific schematic images,such as trajectories or long, thin shapes or containers” (Lakoff 1986:31). There would bethree of such image-schematic models involved here, one for (i) plant parts/natureelements, another for (ii) body parts and, finally, a third for (iii) manufactured elements.",[221]
"8.8.2.2.1        Questioning subject and object          The form used to question the subject or object of a verb is ke-pa (or ki-pa,depending on speech variety). As described in chapter 6, interrogative words in Apurinãcan be compared with interrogative words in other languages. ke- and -pa can becompared with the WH initial in English or the QU initial in Romances languages such asPortuguese. The difference is that ke- and -pa are more clearly segmentable asmorphemes in Apurinã, whereas the others are synchronically more opaque forms, andalso that ke- and -pa are two recurring forms in interrogative words, whereas there is only
                                                  537
one recurring form in English and Portuguese. The following examples are illustrative ofinterrogative words questioning subject/object:
 113a. ke-pa    oka-pe-ru           uwa-nhi?
       WH-INT kill-PFTV-3M.O 3SG.M-AFFECT
       ‘Who/what has killed kill him/it?’    b. ke-pa    p-oka-pe?
       WH-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV
       ‘What/who have you killed?’
       As the following examples show, when nouns such as suto ‘man’ and xenhi‘meat’ occur as part of the interrogative word, the argument being questioned is morespecific, being semantically modified by the interrogative word:
 114a. ke-suto-pa       kariwa        txa-wa?
       WH-woman-INT white.person be-REFL
       ‘Which woman is a white person?’    b. ke-xenhi-pa     hare-ka?
       WH-meat-INT be.good-PRED
       ‘Which meat is good?’
       The interrogative forms in which a noun occurs as part of interrogative wordshave been clearly attested in some speech varieties, and were also reported in Pickering1977b. However, at least one speaker from the Paciá village reported that he himselfwould rather use forms such as the following, where nhi- is added to mark subject/objectas a specific one:
 115a. nhi-ke-ro-pa       kariwa        txa-wa?
       SPEC-WH-3F-INT white.person be-REFL
       ‘Which woman is a white person?’

    b. nhi-ke-ru-pa          ãkiti  oka-pe?
       SPEC-WH-3M-INT jaguar kill-PFTV
       ‘Which jaguar has killed him/it?’
Further research is necessary in order to determine the extent to which this second type ofquestion marking is common in other speech varieties.","[568, 569, 570]"
"Rather, there was a stage when the word meant both A and B, and the earlier meaning ofA eventually was lost” (1991:9). In that view, -muna could be, conceivably, treated as aninstance of polysemy. Now, does this help us answer question I or II posited above?
                                                189
How can we show that each instance of -muna in words like ãã-muna ‘tree,’ aiko-muna‘house beam,’ kiri-muna ‘animal nose’ etc... corresponds to different word meanings thathappen to be expressed in the language by the same phonological form? If we followed astrict version of the polysemy view, we would end up having to accept a lexiconconsisting of lexical entries such as -muna1, -muna2, -muna3, -muna4, -muna5 etc... whichwhen applied to the other CN2s of the language would generate a close to infinite numberof lexical meanings the language learner would need to memorize. This certainly is not adesirable result. If on the other, we assume that there is enough similarities among thevarious uses of -muna that justifies to treat them as semantically related in some way, wefind ourselves in the position of having to show which “similarities” those are.","[220, 221]"

6.4 Interrogative Words            Interrogative words in Apurinã are complex morphological forms that result from thecombination of various formatives. Interrogative words are those used clause-initially tointroduce information questions. They take different forms and are used to introduceinterrogative clauses when questioning subject/object, reason, place, manner, or time, asindicated in Table 5:6

"The answer to this question follows from the definition of word and the domain ofmorphology as described for Apurinã in chapter 3. In its relevant definition, a word canbe as complex as a phrase or clause; in fact, a word can stand syntactically as a phrase oras a clause. However, since the primary goal of morphology is to describe the structureof words, words need to be morphologically described even when they can stand bythemselves as a phrase or clause. This in no way means that all formatives which aremorphologically described cannot be syntactically described as well, or even described asto their discourse functions. To the contrary, such formatives are only morphologicallydescribed insofar as their place in the word needs to be established. Their precisefunction, however, in some cases can only be properly described within the syntactic ordiscourse domain. With this in mind, we can now proceed to analyze themeaning/functional properties of special bound formatives.",[410]
"       One final remark on the syntactic category of VRELs is that a definitive syntacticevidence for the verbal/nominal status of VRELs may be provided by the syntacticexpression of the notional object of transitive VRELs. The question would be whether the
                                               596
syntactic expression of this notional object can be demonstrated to behave as agrammatical object or, for example, as possessive. Further research is necessary here.","[627, 628]"
"        The word forms taking -muna are clearly nouns morphologically, as is attested bythe fact that they take gender markers. Also, there is no question that -ru1 in
                                                244
ãkiti-muna-ru1 is just a gender marker, rather than the object marker for third personmasculine, i.e. -ru (described in detail in chapter 7, in 7.1.12) or the unpossessed markerfor alienable nouns, i.e. -ru2 (described under 4..4.3). If the morpheme in question werethe object marker -ru, it could be replaced with any other object person marker (as in*ãkiti-muna-no/-i/-wa... [jaguar-NMLZ-1SG.O/2SG.O/1PL.O...]), which is not the case;and, if it were -ru2 it could be replaced with -re2 in the possessed form (as in *ãkiti-muna-re2 [jaguar-NMLZ-UNPOSS]), which is also not the case. Finally, the word formationrules for actor nominalization is then as in (88):
          V+muna          
88. NSt →           ru1
           N+muna+ro 
       Finally, although the few instances of words taking -muna are all NOT possessed,I suspect that such words are not sensitive to the alienable versus inalienable markingdistinctions. My suspicion is that nouns marked with -muna can occur either possessedor unpossessed if the appropriate contexts can found. Unfortunately, however, theinstances of such noun forms are too few to allow any satisfactory conclusion on thismatter. More data is required here.","[275, 276]"

 109a. nota kona sa-ru

       d. ??hareka-ru kona
           be.good      not

Masculine and feminine gender can be marked morphologicallyor they can be morphologically unmarked. Unmarked masculine/feminine gender is theone for which no formal grammatical marker is added to the verb. There are variousways to tell the gender of an unmarked noun form in natural discourse, all involving acoreferential formative found in the modifier, determiner or in the predicate. This isillustrated in the following examples in (64a) and (64b), where in the first clause tata‘“umari”’ cross-references the feminine pronominal object form in the verb, whereas inthe second clause yowata ‘knife’ cross-references the masculine pronominal object formin the verb:
                                                218
64a. ata nhika-ro tata
     we eat-3F.O umari
     ‘We eat “umari”.’     b. nota atama-ru      yowata
        I     look-3M.O knife
        ‘I saw the knife.’
           Different from languages such as Portuguese and French, Apurinã does not showcross-referencing between the elements inside nominal phrases, as the possessiveconstructions in (65) illustrate:20
65a. uwa       yowata-ne
     3SG.M knife-POSSED
     ‘his knife’     b. owa      yowata-ne
        3SG.F knife-POSSED
        ‘her knife’
           Nouns that are morphologically unmarked for gender constitute the majority ofthe Apurinã nominal lexicon. They include sex-non-differentiable nouns such as thoselisted in Table 27. As can be gathered from Table 27, the great majority ofmorphologically unmarked noun stems referring to sex-non-differentiable elements isassigned to the masculine gender.","[248, 249, 250]"
"Instead of holding a mass, however, the Apurinãs organize the festival, with muchdancing and singing of Apurinã traditional songs. A special event that is part of thefestival is the ritual of arrival, in which the visitors arrive screaming and giving shots withtheir guns pointed upwards. They go in line around the village with firm steps andscreaming in a thick voice, until a leader in the host village comes to confront a leaderamong the guests in a fast-speaking ceremonial speech. Since this fast speech is anobligatory part of the ritual and since it seems to follow certain conventions in terms of
                                                  25
asking and answering questions, there usually are only a few people in the villages thatcan do it. In fact, the people responsible for this sort of ceremonial speech specialize in itin the same way that some Apurinãs also specialize in carrying the singing through thenight. The difficulty in getting good quality recordings of this ceremonial speech has notallowed me yet to analyze it and verify whether the language used in such a specialoccasion is significantly different from the language used in everyday speech.","[56, 57]"

"        Based on the descriptive information above, two important questions can be askedabout CNs:        I - What is the motivation which may lead the same CN2s with the semantic fieldin (i) to be used to refer to the semantic field in (ii) and/or in (iii), or those with thesemantic field in (ii) to refer to the semantic field in (iii)?

anything on why the source semantic field is (i) rather than (ii), when the converse seemsto be more well attested crosslinguistically?","[219, 220]"
"The definition used here follows from the properties of the Apurinã grammar as well as(partly) from what implicitly or explicitly is found in some of those putativecrosslinguistic definitions of “sentence” (such as the ones given in 3-8). In the wayconceived here, the notion of “sentence”, as unit of syntax, is an abstract construct in away analogous to the way in which “phoneme”, as a unit of phonology, and “morpheme”,as unit of morphology, also are abstract constructs.1
8.1. The Structure of Phrases            The goal of this section is to motivate and describe the constituent structure ofclauses. In providing evidence for parts of speech as units involved in the organization ofclauses, by implication, I have also provided motivation for treating words as constituentsof the clause. What needs to be examined now is the extent to which words can combineinto larger constituents within a clause. There is no question that words constituteindividual constituents within the clause. So, for example, in the first of the three clausesin (9a), suto ‘woman’ occurs preceding the verb apo-pe ‘arrive-PFTV’. As shown by the1
    I have found particular useful the discussions in Lyons 1968:172-180 and Matthews 1981:ch.2 on the various

        One particularity about the positive polarity marker, aru1 ‘yes’, which must be noticed isthat it is the only one (among all particles) that can take the suffix -te ‘really, indeed’, as inaru1-te ‘yes indeed; of course’. Thus, in this respect, aru1 differs from other particles. Polarityparticles are treated here separately from the discourse particles described next because, althoughthey may be used under particular discourse contexts with functions that can only be described interms of discourse-pragmatic factors, they have a well established prototypical function, namelyto mark the polarity of an event/state or of one of its parts. Aside from that, there is at least onehomophonous form, aru2, whose specific function is to serve as a sort of discourse link, thuswithout the meaning associated with a polarity particle.","[402, 403]"

Suchexamples are, nevertheless, given here in order to make complete the list of examples thatmotivate the linear position for each of the special bound formatives in question.

"        Some meanings that are associated with adverbs in European languages (insofar as theyrefer to the intensity of an event/state, the degree to which or the manner in which it takes place)are expressed by bound forms in the verb in Apurinã. Examples of these are –ka‘INTENSIFIER’, -wari ‘almost’, and -ãpo ‘RANDOM’ (described under 5.2.1.1). Otheradverb-like meanings are expressed as verbal constructions, such that, in terms of theirtranslation equivalents, instead of saying ‘He runs rapidly.’ one would say ‘He’s fast.’        Other semantically adverb-like particles include a pair of spatial forms used with deicticfunctions. Analogous to the demonstratives, these spatial adverbial forms can be distal, i.e. farfrom the speaker (or other deictic center), or proximate, i.e. close to the speaker/hearer (or otherdeictic center), as listed in the following Table 7:
                                Table 7: Adverbial Spatial Particles                                    Forms                    Gloss
                                     wai                     ‘here’
                                     werã                    ‘there’                                                       369
The examples in (33) illustrate the use of distal and proximate adverbial particles:
 33a. n-awa-ru       wai
     1SG-exist-3M.O here
     ‘I live here.’    b. nu-sa-ru        werã
      1SG-go-3M.O there
      ‘He went there.’
       One important information related to the approximate adverbial particle wai is that thereis a phonologically identical form that can be used as a descriptive verb. So, the conventionalway to greet a person when visiting an Apurinã village is by uttering (34a), for which (34b) is theconventional answer:
 34a. wai-ka-i             pite
     be.here-PRED-2O 2SG
     ‘Hi there…!’
     Lit.: ‘Are you here?’    b. wai-ka-ra-no                 nota
       be.here-PRED-FOC-2O 1SG
       ‘Hi, I’m here!’
       Lit.: ‘It’s here that I am!’
Both in (34a) and (34b) the form wai is used as a descriptive objective verb which takes theobject pronominal marker to express its notional subject. There are two possible analyses ofthese examples as far as the form wai is concerned. The basic question is whether the proximateadverbial particle and the object descriptive verb are different words or whether they actually arethe same word, namely a proximate adverbial particle that can be used (as other words can) asthe predicate of a “verbless” clause. In this work I will treat wai used in an object descriptivepredicate as a descriptive objective verb, and wai used with an adverbial-like function as an                                                    370
adverbial particle. It is conceivable, however, that this is ultimately a purely terminologicalissue.","[400, 401, 402]"

                                  Verb Morphology5.0. Introduction       The focus of this chapter will be on the internal structure of verbs and theirsyntactic properties; that is, how verbs are formed and the subcategories that may arisefrom their morphological and syntactic properties. As nouns, verbs take boundformatives that only attach to verb forms (i.e. bound formatives that are inherentlyverbal), as well as, also, formatives that occur outside of the inherently verbalmorphology. The majority of this outer-layer morphological forms are not inherentlyverbal insofar as they can attach to nouns, pronouns and/or a few other closed wordclasses (depending on the bound formative in question). In this chapter I will focusexclusively on the morphological forms that are inherently verbal, that is, the boundformatives that only occur as part of verb bases. The bound formatives that occur outsideof the inherently verbal morphology will be described as a special class of boundformatives in chapter 7.","[299, 300]"

7.1.6.      Perfectivity Marking: -pe, -panhi         There are two perfectivity markers that can attach to noun bases, pronoun basesor verb bases, namely the perfective and imperfective aspectual markers. One can arguethat aspectual markers should NOT be considered as part of the noun or pronounmorphology, since the scope of such a marker is the event/state rather than the referent of
                                                394
the noun or pronoun in question. Or, conversely, one can argue that word bases takingperfectivity markers are not noun or pronoun forms since they take marking formsassociated with the event/state expressed in the verb. Although, in a general sense, botharguments could be correct in other languages (or in Apurinã under a different view ofthe domain of morphology), the fact is that the word forms described below as takingaspectual markers fit the definition of grammatical words given in chapter 3, regardlessof their translation into English. In other words, there is no reason to think thatperfectivity markers make a noun or a pronoun into a verb. In the following subsection, Iwill merely illustrate some examples of noun, pronoun and verb bases marked withperfectivity markers. I will return to the discussion of perfectivity markers in chapter 8,in 8.6.2, where I will provide a more detailed description of the semantics of perfectivitymarkers. In translating clauses marked with perfectivity markers, I will use the Englishperfective form have V-ed to translate the perfective marking, and the English formstill/yet to translate the imperfective marking. Although this does not constitute a“perfect” translation of the perfectivity markers, it covers some of their most typicalmeanings —which will be described in detail in chapter 8.6.2.","[425, 426]"
"Furthermore, in addition to these pronominal properties, the following examples showother properties that the morphemes in question also have and that suggest that they markverbal rather than nominal constructions. In (42) (repeated from 36a), the ClREL is anominal predicate with two interesting aspects that require observation: First, therelativization is marked with -karo attached to the copula verb inha, and, second, theverbal reflexive bound form -wa follows the relativizing form. The presence of -karoattached to the main verb is ambiguous because this specific copula verb form occursboth with nominal predicates and with descriptive verbal predicates,6 but, the presence ofthe verbal reflexive morpheme -wa following -karo constitutes unambiguous evidencethat the VREL is somehow verbal —not nominal:
         S/S [ O           V-rel.s]ClREL      V
    42. suto   popũka-ro inha-karo-wa       apo-pe
        woman Apurinã be-REL.M.POS.S-REFL arrive-PFTV
        ‘The woman who was Apurinã arrived.’

    No example is available to decide whether the relativizing forms can also attach to the purely verbal auxiliary form

3.6.2        Allomorphy of Pronominal Markers        Pronominal markers are bound forms inflecting for person, gender, and, under onespecific analysis, subject or possessor. They assume different shapes that are determinedby phonological processes taking place at specific morphemic boundaries and which mayor may not generalize to other environments (depending on whether the shapes arephonologically or grammatically conditioned). Table 2 lists the first set of pronominalmarkers (underlined for emphasis). They always occur when the word form that theyattach to starts with a non-palatal consonant: (I will use a partial phonemic transcriptionin the remaining of this chapter so as to be able to present the relevant phoneticinformation. I will not mark the secondary stress, but will mark nasality even for non-inherently nasal vowels.)

As was noticed in chapter 2, nasalization fluctuates in such anenvironment. Because nasal and oral vowels are in free variation when preceding a nasalconsonant, pronominal markers that appear nasalized in such an environment will not be

taken to constitute a separate set of pronominal allomorphs. The first set given above can beargued to constitute the elsewhere cases, thus representing the basic/underlying forms outof which other forms can be derived as a result of the rules presented at the end of thissubsection. The fact that in Table 2 (as well as in the next tables) the form for third pluralsubject/possessor is realized as the (putative) discontinuous formative /-...-na/ in verbs ishere analyzed as a result of a discontinuous dependency relation between the two formatives/-/ and /-na/. In other words, the forms in question occur in mutual dependency to performa (combination of) function(s), namely to encode third person plural in the verbs. Themorpheme /-/, given here as the third person plural for nouns, occurs in only some speechvarieties, while in others /-...-na/ is used for both verbs and nouns. I will ignore thisdistinction here, and will mention it again in chapters 5 and 7. A more detailedmorphological description of these pronominal markers will be presented in 7.1.1.","[171, 172, 173]"

Amongthem I thank most especially to the two Mipa Xirĩkaya, to Itaruru, Mainharu, Tokatxi,Kasãtomaro, Mokato, Koyoru, Matu, Kaneepa, Oyaka, Xirikoyaro, Powami,Bernaldinho, Artur, Pedrinho, Conceição, Chico Preto, Catuta, Antonio Apurinã, and somany others. Special thanks go also to Matthew Dryer for guiding me through theprocess of writing the dissertation, helping me to learn what I knew and what I stillneeded to know about Apurinã and about linguistics. My thanks also to the other readersof the dissertation, Karin Michelson and Wolfgang Wölck for all of their comments,suggestions and critiques, and to Sasha (Alexandra Aikhenvald) for making me come toterms with other Arawak languages. Most special thanks to my parents and to Kade fortheir love, care and trust. I thank all the professors of the linguistic departments ofSUNY-Buffalo and of the University of Oregon who in different times taught medifferent ways of doing linguistics; among them I thank especially Colette Grinevald,who first taught me how to go about writing a grammatical description. Late thanks go toSarah Lichtenstein, who for some years shared with me certain critical views that need tobe taken into account no matter what. Thanks to Denny Moore, who supported my earlywork in important ways. Finally I thank the friends and colleagues who made graduateschool easier and pleasant, and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico eTecnológico (CNPq), Inter-American Foundation, World Wildlife Fund, and Wenner-Gren Foundation for the financial support during part of my graduate studies.

            AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF       Sidney da S. Facundes     for the degree of     Doctor of Philosophy       in the Department of Linguistics to be taken January 2000               Title: THE LANGUAGE OF THE APURINÃ PEOPLE OF BRAZIL       (MAIPURE/ARAWAK)       A somewhat typologically informed grammatical description of the Apurinãlanguage is provided, including historical, socio-cultural, demographic and geographicinformation about the Apurinã society. The Apurinã communities spread alongtributaries of the Purus River, in western Brazilian Amazon. The grammatical analysisconsists of the phonology, morphology and syntax, with appendixes on languagevariation and the design of the Apurinã ortography, a text sample, a vocabulary list, and apreliminary reconstruction of Proto-Apurinã-Piro-Iñapari. The grammatical analysis isbased on language internal factors, though with some typological observations on majoraspects. The segmental phonology is simple; morphophonemic alternations are restrictedto pronominal subject/possessor markers and a few other bound morphemes. Stress ispredictably penultimate, though with exceptions that need further investigation.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"
"Hence, since the only non-subject argument required in a clause with a ditransitive verbis the goal argument, it would be logical to conclude that only the (morpho)syntactic10
     I have found more recently that this is not true of all dialects, since in some of them the example in (53b) is                                                                   479
expression of the goal argument should be considered the object of clauses withditransitive verbs. So, in an example such as (52b), where it is the undergoer NPnu-serepi ‘my arrow.of’ that is coreferential with the pronominal marker in the verb (notthe goal NPobl uwa-mokaru ‘to him’), the question arises as to which element is the objectof the verb, the goal NPobl or the undergoer NP. I will maintain that the element that iscoreferential with the pronominal marker in the verb is the object in the cause, thuspostulating that object pronominal marking is the primary definitional property ofgrammatical objects. That is, in (52b), uwa-mokaru is the object in the clause. Thisquestion, however, about which element is the object of the verb only appears to arise inelicited data, as there is no instance of natural spontaneous data where the undergoerargument is expressed as a free syntactic expression that is coreferential with apronominal object marker in the verb. In natural texts, only the goal arguments co-occurwith such a pronominal marker. Instances of both goal and undergoer arguments co-occurring pre-verbally (thus, with no accompanying coreferential marker) is even lessnatural and, perhaps, an artifact of the method by which the data are collected, i.e.through elicitation.","[510, 511]"

6.6 Interjections       Interjections are the word forms that are used with particular exclamatory purposes, likecalling somebody, screaming, expressing pain, surprise, or other sort of feelings. A systematicsurvey of exclamatory words in Apurinã still needs to be carried out, since gender and age(among other) factors seem to play a role in determining the use of such words. The examples in(29) illustrate some of these exclamatory words. As shown by (27c), some particles can also beused with exclamatory functions:
 29a. hei!                             ‘man answering a call’    b. oh!                             ‘woman answering a call’    c. ha!                             ‘initiating story-telling’    d. ateeneka!                       ‘Right!’    e. ne-putu-ka-ru!                  ‘True, indeed!’
      ?-EMPH-PRED-3M.O    e. etc...",[397]
"The terminology used is this section is primarily based on Campbell 1999:111-112.         327 words were examined, including body parts, kinship terms, various animal and plant names,descriptive and grammatical words, among others. There were a total of 122 cognate sets shared by API,56 shared by Apurinã and Piro (but not by Iñapari), 28 shared only by Apurinã and Iñapari (but not by
                                                         658
Piro), and 12 shared by Piro and Iñapari (but not by Apurinã). The 122 cognate sets represent 39% ofshared lexical (i.e. vocabulary) retention in API. Although such a vocabulary similarity confirms earliersuspicion that API are closely related and may descend from a proto-language, i.e. API, as part of anintermediary branch of Arawak, shared lexical similarities alone cannot be used to show how closelyrelated to one another these three languages are, nor can they be used to prove that API indeed form asubgroup of Arawak. Table 1 (where Ø marks the cases where the reflex of the proto-sound isphonologically null, i.e. absent, in the vocabulary item in question) gives only a partial list of the cognatesets illustrating the most obvious sound correspondences that were used to reconstruct a preliminarysegmental inventory for P-API. From left to right, the first column of Table 1 provides the English gloss ofthe cognate sets given in the second, third and fourth columns for Apurinã, Piro and Iñapari, respectively;whereas the fifth column gives the reconstructed proto-sounds for P-API. These reconstructed forms areeasily arrived at when their reflexes remain the same in all the sister languages, as shown by most of thesound correspondences given in the table above. So, for example, in the cognate set pekiri:pexØri:pehiri‘agouti’, since the word initial sound p remains constant in the same environment across the three itemsbeing compared, *p can be posited as the ancient (proto-sound) which the reflexes p:p:p descend from. Inother cases, however, a number of sound changes needs to be posited in order to determine which proto-sound will be reconstructed. For example, in the cognate set koti:koti:Øotí ‘rat’, the word initial phonemek is found both in Apurinã and in Piro, respectively, but the same phoneme is absent in the word initialposition in Iñapari in pretty much the same environment (where the absence of the phoneme is representedby Ø). Since the odds are that it is more likely that one language alone changed, while the other two didnot, rather than the reverse (there being no evidence to the contrary), and since the dropping of a consonantis quite common as a historical phonological process (i.e. more common than the addition of it) acrosslanguages, we can posit that in the correspondence set k:k:Ø, *k was originally found in P-API, and thatthis original sound was preserved in Apurinã and in Piro, but *k was dropped in word initial environment inIñapari. In fact, to give a more complete picture, *k was preserved (as k) in all environments in Apurinã (as

encoded crosslinguistically. These generalized semantic notions will simplify thepresentation of the dissociation between core grammatical relations and semantic rolesbut will NOT affect the final results of the analysis in the ways that are relevant formotivating subject and object in Apurinã. The generalized “agent”-like semantic rolewill be called actor, whereas the “patient”-like semantic role will be called undergoer(idem). The example in (47) aims to illustrate that subject can be dissociated from itsmost typical semantic correlate, i.e. actor. So, in the following example uwa-nhi‘3SG.M-AFFECT’ is an undergoer subject: 7
     S                 V
47. uwa-nhi             iri-pe
   3SG.M-AFFECT fall-PFTV
   ‘He/it has fallen down.’
The next example shows that subject can also be dissociated from its most typicalpragmatic role, i.e. topic from previous discourse. The following example could be ananswer to the question “Who shot it?”, where the subject refers to a newly introducedparticipant in the discourse:8
7
    The apparent assumption held here is that there is a strong correlation between subject and actor/cataphoric topic, and
     of object with undergoer. Rather than an assumption, however, such correlations are well documented in the works
     of Givón (e.g. 1995 ch. 3, 1992, 1990 ch. 20, 1988, 1983) and others.

    The two examples above illustrate the type of test that needs to be done in order to show that grammatical relations
     are distinct from semantic or pragmatic relations. Although, in principle, one should perform such tests for each type
     of evidence presented for grammatical relations, in fact, this is not done here. Instead, in the following subsections I
     only perform the test with respect to the most typical semantic role associated with the relevant grammatical relation,
     making only textual mentions of the dissociation between a specific grammatical relation and its pragmatic role.
     This can only be done here because the evidence in the language against treating subject/object as performing purely
     pragmatic roles is so overwhelming that it would be redundant to repeat it for each time a property of a grammatical
     relation is presented.","[503, 504]"
"Although a preliminary analysis of prosodic structures is suggested, more work isrequired in this area. The morphology is complex and includes special bound formswhich are partially distinguishable from typical affixes. Nouns and verbs are clearly

distinct syntactic categories; however, property-referring words are describable as asubclass of intransitive verbs. Classificatory nouns are used as part of productive nouncompounding and a subset of them can be verb-incorporated and refer back to physicaland shape properties of participants previously mentioned in the discourse —in this wayresembling verb incorporated classifiers of North American languages. The descriptionof the syntactic organization of the language involves, to a great extent, examining thefunctions and behavior of bound morphemes, and reaches its highest complexity in thesystem of relative clauses. A subset of property-referring words, called objectivedescriptive verbs, presents a morphologically marked split intransitivity system which ispartly based on the semantic class of these verbs. Such a system is typical of Arawaklanguages. The constituent order is semi-free; the VO order is the most frequent in texts,but the patterns of word order correlations point to OV. Overal, the Apurinã languageconstitutes a laboratory for examining the interplay between morphological forms andsyntactic structure and functions, providing certain grammatical and semantic categoriesand structures that resemble only in part those attested in other languages.

     exists as a head, with no other body parts.)
        In (4), as everywhere else in this work, inalienable nouns are glossed as ‘N of’,where “N” is the lexical meaning of the inalienable noun in question and “of” marks it asobligatorily possessed. Thus, in the analysis proposed here, obligatory possession is partof the lexical entry of inalienable nouns; that is, it is stored with the lexical entries ofinalienable nouns, rather than added by morphosyntactic rules. As seen (4a), nomorphological marker is added when an inalienable noun occurs possessed, and, as aconsequence, the syntactic context in which inalienable nouns occur possessed is onewhere two nouns are placed together by juxtaposition. On the other hand, wheninalienable nouns occur unpossessed they require the presence of the unpossessionmarker -txi:        The example given in (4) may suggest that possession constructions such as[kema kuwu] can be described purely in terms of the syntactic structure internal to thenominal phrase. In this case, the possession relation would not be marked by any lexicalproperty of the possessed noun but, instead, by a syntactic distribution in which thepossessor would always precede the possessed noun. However, while this “precedencerule” is a necessary part of the grammar of possession constructions in the language, it isnot sufficient to describe them. The reason is a twofold one: First, it is necessary to referto the lexical property of inalienable nouns in order to describe which ones take theunpossessed suffix -txi; second, it is necessary to refer to their lexical property also inorder to explain why they do not take the possessed suffixes described below foralienable nouns.","[183, 184]"

"8.5.1.1      Causatives          As seen in 5.2.1.1.1.2, 5.2.1.1.1.5 and 5.2.1.2.1.4, there are three forms ofmorphological causatives in the language. The first causativizer is the class1 boundverbal form -kũtaka, used with transitive verbs, and described in 5.2.1.1.1.5 above. -kũtaka is illustrated in clausal context in (79a), where it attaches to the transitive verb nhika‘to eat’; p-ita-ru ‘2SG-cousin.of-M’ refers to the one caused to do something (i.e. thecausee); yapa ‘“capibara”’ is what was caused to be eaten; and the subject marker a-refers to the one who causes the causee to do something (i.e. the causer). nhika is abivalent verb, but in this example it works as a trivalent one as a result of the presence ofthe causativizer: (In these and in other examples below, underlining is used just to                                                   505
highlight the causativizer, whereas double underlining indicates coreference betweendouble-underlined forms.)

     ‘Let’s make him eat “capybara”.’
       The example in (79b) illustrates the fact that, in causative constructions, thecausee can be marked in the verb as the object marker. Thus, the NP-causee bears thesubject whereas the NP-causer bears the object grammatical relations. The question leftunanswered is what the grammatical relation of ‘what is caused to be V-ed’ is. In otherwords: What is the grammatical relation of yapa in (79)? One possible analysis of thisthird argument of causative constructions is to treat it as bearing an oblique grammaticalrelation. The problem, however, of treating arguments such as yapa in (79) as an obliqueis that this argument is not structurally optional in the clause in the same way as otherobliques are in the language. Another possible analysis is to treat it as a secondary objectthat is restricted to causative constructions. The problem with this second analysis is thatthere is no independent evidence to treat such an argument as an object. The notion of agrammatical object was defined for Apurinã over the possibility of a free expression co-occur with a coreferential object marker in the verb. As was shown in (79), the objectmarker in the verb of causative constructions is coreferential with the causee and not with‘what is caused to be V-ed’. Hence, either analyses have problems. In order to avoidpositing an ill motivated solution to this problem, I will choose to leave undetermined
                                                506
what the grammatical relation of ‘what is caused to be V-ed’ is in a causativeconstruction. I suspect that further research on the intrinsic properties of objects andobliques in Apurinã will reveal ways that will help to resolve the issue.","[536, 537, 538]"
"There are reasons to say that the latter alternative better describes iye. That is, it would appearthat the discourse particle iye is already a lexically distinct word. The main evidence for this isthe fact that iye but not *oye (the feminine demonstrative counterpart) can be used as a discourseparticle. Similar reasoning applies to aru2 in relation to the positive polarity marker aru1.",[404]

"       The semantic development of CNs suggests a number of semantic changes thatcan be explained through metaphorical extensions of particular source meanings intoparticular target meanings. One type of semantic change observed was that which occurswhen plant parts have their meaning extended to refer to body parts. In contrast, anothersemantic change occurs with the extension of meaning from plant parts to manufacturedelements. For instance, there is a sense in which the use of -muna in ãã-muna ‘tree’ isdifferent from its use in kiri-muna ‘animal’s nose’; and the use of -muna in aiko-muna‘house bean’ is different from both of the previous uses. In the first case, -muna refers tothe properties of a plant; in the second case, -muna refers to the properties of a body part;and in the third case, -muna refers to the properties of a manufactured element. Is it thecase that, in the three cases, -muna carries the same meaning properties? If yes, thenwhat are these meaning properties? Are the various uses of -muna a case of polysemy orhomonyny?",[220]

       When these tripartite morphemic clusters are contrasted to the way languagesgenerally mark ClRELs, they are found to be somewhat comparable to the relativepronouns commonly found in European languages (Keenan 1985:149-152, Comrie1989: 149-150, Givón 1990:656-658). Similar to relative pronouns, relative pronominalmarkers in Apurinã occur inside the ClREL indicating the role of the headREL, andfunctioning as subordinators. So, for example, the pairs -k-a-r-u/r-o vs. -k-u-t-u/t-o, inApurinã, and who vs. whom, in English, are both relative pronominal forms that occurinside the ClREL, marking the headREL as subject and object respectively. The differences

between these two pairs are in their phonological status (as bound vs. free forms), in thenumber of functional properties they encode (i.e. grammatical relation, voice, polarity,number and gender in Apurinã vs. grammatical relation and animacy in English), in theirposition inside the ClREL (i.e. following the verb in Apurinã vs. initial in the ClREL inEnglish), and, finally, in that only the Apurinã forms can also mark headless ClRELs.","[623, 624]"

(81a) states that noun stems can consist of roots that follow three morphological markingpatterns; (81b) states that a subset of these roots will follow the inalienablemorphological marking pattern which, as stated in (81b’) is that where the root is markedby the unpossessed marker –txi in noun stems that are unpossessed and where the root isunmarked in noun stems that are possessed; (81c) lists the three subtypes of roots whichfollow the alienable morphological marking pattern which, as stated in (81c’), willconsist of the suffixation of one of the three possessed markers –te, -ne or –re1(depending on which marker is selected by the root) when the noun stem occurspossessed, and of no overt morphological marking (i.e. Ø) when the noun stem isunpossessed; (81d) states that another subset of roots will follow the mixed (double-marked) morphological marking pattern where, as stated in (81d’), such roots will besuffixed by the unpossessed marker –ru2 when the noun stem occurs unpossessed, and bythe possessed marker –re2 when the noun stem occurs possessed.:
4.4.4 Instrumental/Object Nominalizer: -iko       -iko attaches to transitive or intransitive verbs to derive ‘things to V with’ or‘things to V’, thus as an instrumental or object nominalizer, as illustrated in (82):                                                 240

Notice that, as the examples in (82a) and (82c) indicate, -iko can attach to verb forms thatare themselves inflected. When this happens, the verbal formatives that occur within thenominalized form have their meaning and function canceled out —a property which is notexclusive of -iko, as will be seen further below. Differently from other derived formspresented later, there is no question, however, that V-iko forms are nouns rather than verbsmorphologically, as they can take inherent noun morphology such as, e.g., the pluralmarker nu-ru (described later under 4.5.3), as in suk-iko-nu-ru ‘diggers’. -iko has lowproductivity in the language insofar as it occurs with very few of the nouns it couldlogically occur with. The word formation rule for instrumental derivation is then as in(83):
       83. NSt → V + iko
         Moreover, as the examples in (82) indicate, neither alienability nor inalienabilityare grammatically encoded as part of noun stems taking -iko. That is, V-iko forms doNOT require any alienability or inalienability formal marking device, as can be seen bycontrasting (82a,c) to (82b), where in (82a,c) the V-iko is not possessed while in (82c) itis.","[270, 271, 272]"
