4.4. Questions   4.4.1. Yes-no questions. Yes-no questions are basically as in
Spanish, with rising intonation, but with no particular word-order
changes. A few examples are:      1) ta tesu ti-sekmiki?
      what no you-feel cold?
      ""Don't you feel cold?""      2) ti-k-piya we:y pan? (A-12)
      you-it-have lots bread?
      ""Do you have a lot of bread?""      3) uni ti-nemi? (S-22)
      that you-is?
      ""Is that you?""",[128]

              DedicationTo my Pipil teachers, helpers, and friends.
                            Acknowledgements     I owe a debt of gratitute to many for financial, intellectual, and moral support. I
thank the National Science Foundation and the State University of New York Research
Foundation for grants which supported my fieldwork and investigations in El Salvador. I
am also grateful to the Instituto de Investigaciones Filológicas of the Universidad Nacio-
nal Autónoma de México for support which allowed me to complete some of the histori-
cal aspects of this study and to write it up.
    I wish to thank Maria Esperanza Aguilar de Smith-Stark for much help with Salvado-
ran Spanish from the Pipil area. Claudia Parodi also assisted me with Spanish and in the
initial version of this manuscript (which was written in Spanish, but converted to English
for this publication). While Una Canger did not see the manuscript of this book before
publication, discussions with her helped me in many ways to improve both the content
and its organization.
     Above all, I wish to extend my deep appreciation to my Pipil teachers and consul-
tants, who shared their language with me. I hope that this work will some day in some
way come to be of some benefit to them.

                         Introduction
0. Introduction   The native language of western El Salvador, the subject of this
book, is known in the linguistic literature as Pipil, although its
speakers call it na:wat in the language itself and Nahuate in
Spanish. Here it is called Pipil because this usage is so strongly
entrenched in the scientific literature that it could not easily be
changed. Nevertheless, it is to be hoped that Na:wat (Nahuate) may
gain more general acceptance in honor of and in deference to its
speakers.   This book, then, presents a description of this
language.
   This chapter is concerned with the present and past geographical
distribution of Pipil, its history to the extent that it is known,
its genetic classification, and its dialects. The following three
chapters present a description of the language's structure: its
phonology (chapter 2), its lexical categories and morphology (chap-
ter 3), and its syntax (chapter A). Chapter 5 contains the Pipil-
Spanish-English dictionary representing the two main dialects,
Cuisnahuat (C) and Santo Domingo de G u z m á n (SD), with occasional
forms from other dialects.       Chapter 6 is the Spanish-Pipil
dictionary. Chapter 7 contains folkloric texts accompanied by a
morpheme-by-morpheme analysis and translation in Spanish and a more
flowing English narrative translation. Many of the examples cited
in other chapters are taken from these texts, which are coded with
a letter to identify the narrative involved and a number which
refers to the line within the text. The appendices contain addi-
tional historical information. Appendix 1 compares Pipil in detail
with other southern varieties of Nahua in order to determine
precisely its relationship to them. Appendix 2 solves the contro-
versial question concerning the Nahua of central Guatemala, which
have often been assumed to be Pipil but w h i c h turn out to be in
origin post-Conquest and from central Mexico.
   The purpose of this book, then, is to present a basic reference
work on Pipil, a sort of ""handbook"" of the language.

"      4.2.5.2. ""To be"" questions.     S o m e ""to be"" questions are:         ka(h) taha       Who are you?
         ka uni           Who is it?
         ka:η nemi        Where is it?
         ke:n ti-nemi     How are you?
                                                                  113
(For more details and for other questions, see section 4.4.)   4.2.5.3. Irregular ""to be"" forms. Some irregular forms which
function as adjectives with the sense of ""to be"" are:    se:n-kak        to be together (cf. se:(η) ""one, together"")
    mu-ets-tuk (C), to be seated
     mu-es-tuk (SD)
    ihka-tuk        to be standing   A construction with   is also found in the cleft sentences (cf.
4.16); other nemi constructions include its auxiliary function in
'progressives' (see 4.20.1). (Cf. also the -ti 'inchoative'
suffix, 3.7.8.3.3.)
4.3. Non-distinct arguments   The concept of non-distinctness refers to transitive sentences
in which the subject and direct object are either coreferential or
one of these arguments (subject or direct object) is not specified.
The kinds of 'non-distinct' arguments are passives, reflexives,
impersonale, and unspecified direct-object markers (cf. Langacker
1977:46-8). Many of these forms were already considered in the
morphology (chapter 3); for 'reflexives' (-mu-) cf. 3.7.4.1, for
the 'unspecified object' markers, see 3.7.4.2. (both te:- human and
ta- nonhuman); passive verb morphology (-lu-, -ua) was treated in
3.7.8.4.
   There is also an impersonal construction formed of 'third
personal plural' verbs (i.e. with the suffix -t) where the subject
is not otherwise specified, meaning, e.g. ""fish are eaten in
Japan"", that is equivalent to English ""they"" in ""they eat fish in
Japan"". For example:    1) nech-tawilih-ke-t ne pe:lu.
    me-give-PRET-PL the dog.
    ""They gave me the dog."" - ""I was given the dog.""   2) de mala swerte ki-mu:tia-t.
   of bad luck him frighten-PL.
   ""Unfortunately they frightened him."" • ""Unfortunately, he
   was frightened.""
114
      3) yaha ki-tahtan se: konse:hoh wan ki-maka-ke-t.
      he it-asked an advice and it-give-PRET-PL.
      ""He asked for advice and they gave it (to him)."" = ""He
      asked for advice and was given it.""      4) k-ilwih-ke-t ma: ki-ma:waltl chi:l.
      hira-tell-PRET-PL that her-smear chili.
      ""They told him to annoint her (with) chili."" = ""He was told
      to smear chili on her.""      5) nech-ilwih-ke-t ka nu-siwa:-w bru:hah. (N-25)
      me-tell-PRET-PL that my-wife-POSS witch.
      ""They told me that my wife (was a) witch."" = ""I was told my
      wife is a witch.""","[126, 127, 128]"
"   2. Glottochronology. Several calculations of Nahua glotto-
chronology have been presented which involve Pipil and upon which
claims about Nahua classification have been based, e.g. Swadesh
1954-1955, 1963, 1967, Kaufman 1974, Garcia de León 1976,
Luckenbach and Levy 1980, and Fowler 1981. While glottochronology
is at best highly controversial, nevertheless proposals for Pipil
based on these calculations should be discussed. To begin with,
however, it should be mentioned that glottochronology has been
largely discredited, its basic assumptions have been challenged,
and its results often prove erroneous (cf. Campbell 1977:62-5).
   Garcia de León has placed Pipil close to Veracruz and Tabascan
varieties based on his counts. He says:    En cuanto a las relaciones internas del nahua del Golfo
    lo más significativo es el hecho de que la distancia
    interna mayor es de 9 siglos mínimos (between
    Cosoleacaque and Jalupa); en tanto que el pipil
    salvadoreño sólo difiere 6 siglos de Tuxtlas, Jaltipan,
    Pajapan, Boquiapan y Jalupa, lo cual indica que el
    primero es producto de un movimiento reciente que se
    efectuó en tiempos históricos (sólo 2 siglos antes de la
    Conquista); o bien, que habiéndose movido desde antes,
    fue hasta 6 siglos que perdió el contacto con la costa
    del Golfo. No seria nada aventurado suponer que antes
    del 1300 dC existia una continuidad de grupos nahuas
    desde Veracruz y Tabasco, hasta Guatemala y El Salvador;
    pasando por los Altos de Chiapas (dialecto del nahua del
    que quedaban hasta hace poco hablantes en Soyaló y
    Bochil) y por la costa del Soconusco (Huehuetán y otros).
    Probablemente, la expansión de los señoríos quichés y
    cakchiqueles de Guatemala favoreció la separación que
    explicaría los 6 siglos de divergencia entre el nahua del
    Golfo y el salvadoreño. (García de León 1976:41)García de León presented the Swadesh list of 100 words in various
Gulf dialects, but did not include the Pipil words with which he
compared them to arrive at his dates. He calculated that Pipil
shares 84% with the Nahua of Los Tuxtlas, Pajapan, Jáltipan
934(Veracruz), and Boquiapan (Tabasco), a separation of 5.8 minimum
centuries. His Gulf Nahua varied from 8 to 13 centuries with
respect to ""Mexihca"" ( C l a s s i c a l Nahuatl) and to other Nahua d i a -
l e c t s , which compares w e l l with Kaufman's f i g u r e of 11 minimum
centuries f o r General Nahua, i . e . Nahua minus Pochutec (Kaufman
1974:73).
      Luckenbach and Levy (1980), basing t h e i r c a l c u l a t i o n s on 25
dialects, follow Swadesh (1954-1955) in believing that the inter-
d i a l e c t a l r e l a t i o n s h i p s are ""properly thought of as 'chains' or
' n e t s ' , where each d i a l e c t has i t s c l o s e s t a f f i n i t i e s with i t s
immediate neighbor"" (p.456). They support the traditional three-
way s p l i t in Nahua of ""Nahuatl, Nahual, and Nahuat ( P i p i l ) , and a
variant i s o l a t e from Pochutla"" (p.456). They c a l c u l a t e the e a r -
l i e s t separations f o r Pochutla (= Pochutec) and Xochitlahuaca,
Guerrero from the remainder of Nahua at 543 A.D., with their Nahuat
( P i p i l ) node s p l i t t i n g o f f at 801 A.D. and with ""a Nahuat-Nahuatl
divergence ... calculated at A.D. 1072, and younger Intradialecti-
c a l ( s i c ) nodes ... found f o r Nahuat (A.D. 1257), Nahual (A.D.
1442), and Nahuatl (A.D. 1304 and 1511)"" (p.457).
      Fowler's (1981) c a l c u l a t i o n s correspond to these in s e v e r a l
ways. He placed the f i r s t s p l i t , that of Pochutec from other
Nahua, at 15 centuries ago, ca. 500 A.D.. He equated the "" f i r s t
P i p i l migrations out of c e n t r a l Mexico i n t o the lowlands of
Veracruz and Central America"" (p.539-43) with a group he c a l l e d
""Nahuat"" (a _ t - d i a l e c t ) , which includes Zacapoaxtla, Chicontepec,
T a t e l a , Mecayapan, and El Salvador.                   He placed t h i s Nahuat
migration at ca. 801 and put the beginnings of i t s i n t e r n a l
divergence at ca. 965 A.D. This matches Kaufman's (1974) date of
900 to 1,000 f o r the P i p i l migrations.                  S p e c i f i c a l l y , Fowler
(1981:536) presents the following years of separation:      1142 Salvador and Classical Nahuatl
      1097 Salvador and North Puebla
      942 Salvador and Milpa Alta
      1312 Salvador and Mecayapan
      1424 Salvador and Pochutec
      993 Salvador and Zacapoaxtla
      555 Salvador and Las Tuxtlas
      1044 Salvador and Tatela
      1044 Salvador and Chicontepec     Even i f these glottochronologlcal dates could be accepted with
confidence, they would s t i l l present d i f f i c u l t i e s of i n t e r p r e t a -
tion. For example, given Garcia de León's 7 centuries of internal
v a r i a t i o n among his Gulf d i a l e c t s (e.g. between Mecayapan and
                                                               935Jalupa), one must ask how Salvadoran Pipil's separation could be
shorter (only 6 centuries when compared with certain of these
dialects; Garcia de León 1976:41). Ethnohistorical sources seem to
indicate longer separation, but they, too, are difficult to inter-
pret unambiguously (see below). In any event, successful classifi-
cation cannot be based on glottochronology.
   The main question is whether the similarities shared by Pipil
and other Nahua varieties (especially Isthmus (Gulf) and Sierra de
Puebla) indicate a closer genetic relationship, or, whether Pipil's
marked differences mean that it is to be considered a distinct
variety with no closer connection to these other dialects. Given
the untrustworthy nature of Nahua dialectology and the unclear
status of the shared traits, it is possible that the question may
have no satisfactory answer. Nevertheless, based on standard
criteria for classification, I believe that Pipil is a distinct
branch. The similarities are either retentions of Proto-Nahua
features (which dialects may share by virtue of not having changed,
regardless of possible closer connections) or are parallel, inde-
pendent innovations (changes that easily take place independently).
On the other hand, Pipil's differences are not so easily explained
away. To repeat just one example, Pipil preserves original -_t
'plural', which has changed to -h (or corresponding          in all
others except Pochutec. This means that these others share an
innovation which argues that they were still unified when Pipil
split off, after which they changed to -h (~2) and subsequently
broke up into the extant variants. The only alternative historical
explanation that is at all plausible is the possibility that Pipil
and certain others were closer relatives, splitting off as a single
branch, with Pipil subsequently withdrawing while its remaining
close relatives underwent the -t_ to -h change under influence from
other dialects which had formerly so changed. While this is not
impossible, one would need to be able to show that Pipil and its
assumed closer relatives shared certain innovations before the
break up. The similarities are not compelling in this regard.
Moreover, there ought to be evidence of the assumed later diffu-
sion of the -jt to -Ji change in the others, but such evidence is
unknown.
   Thus, while it is not impossible that Pipil bears some closer
connection to dialects of Veracruz, Tabasco, or elsewhere, the
evidence suggests rather its long independence.       It is best
considered an independent branch of Nahua, not a member of Core
Nahua, but having split off from the rest of the family after
Pochutec was first separated.

verbs, corresponding to infinitives in many other languages. In
Pipil, they occur juxtaposed, but each bears the subject pronominal
prefixes. Thus, literally ""I went by to see it"" is ""I-passed I-it-

   4.19. -chiwa + Spanish infinitive. Often so-called minority
languages, spoken in the social or political setting where some
other language dominates them in power or prestige (usually in
situations involving extensive bilingualism) contain constructions
for employing directly unassimilated forms from the dominant
language. Very often this involves the native verb ""to do"" plus an
infinitive from the dominant language, as is the case of Pali forms
used in Burmese, Arabic loans in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu, and of
Chinese borrowings into Japanese, among others. In some of these
languages it is a former contact situation of dominance which has
left its reflexes, although the domination no longer exists.
Spanish verbs are employed in this way in various Mayan languages
and other Indian languages of Mesoamerica. Pipil utilizes -chiwa
""to do"" plus unassimilated Spanish infinitives , which provides
Pipil, in effect, with the richness of Spanish concepts not easily
expressed in Pipil, and allows speakers access to the prestige of
Spanish even in cases where Pipil has perfectly equivalent verbs.
It is also used frequently when the Pipil form is not readily
remembered. Since the Spanish infinitive also functions as a nomi-
nallzation, structurally it is not so strange to see it with -chiwa
""to do"", where it could be thought of as something like, e.g.
 ni-k-chiwa luchâr ""I do fighting"", i.e. ""I fight"". In this con-
struction, the tenses, aspects, pronominal subjects and objects,
reflexives, etc. are born by -chiwa and the Spanish infinitive does
not vary.   While these infinitives are not properly speaking part
of Pipil, they are presented in the examples and in the texts in
the Pipil practical orthography and not in Spanish spelling. Some
examples taken from the texts are the following; for the full
sentential contexts see these texts:   1) mu-chiw-ki proponér (H-6)
   it was proposed (cf. Sp. se propuso)   2) ki-chiw-ki desplumár (H-12)
   (she) plucked it (cf. Sp. lo desplumó)   3) mu-chiw-ke-t afihár (H-13)

   (he) answered (it) (cf. Sp. lo contestò)   5) mu-chiw-ke-t elebár wan mu-chiw-ke-t desaparesér (U-26)
   REFLEX-do-PRET-PL rise and REFLEX-do~PRET-PL disappear.
   ""They rose and disappeared."" (cf. Sp. elevarse, desaparecerse.)

               Pipil-Spanish-English Dictionary
5.0. Introduction       This dictionary covers the two P i p i l dialects which today have
the greatest number of speakers, Cuisnahuat (abbreviated (C)) and
Santo Domingo de Guzmán (signaled by (SD)). Entries are preceded
by either (C) or (SD) to identify the dialect.                      When both dialects
contain a form, the Cuisnahuat version i s l i s t e d f i r s t ( i . e . , in
alphabetical order), followed by the Santo Domingo de Guzmán form.
Material common to the two d i a l e c t s i s presented only in the
Cuisnahuat entry and not repeated f o r the Santo Domingo de Guzmán
version.            Nevertheless, when there are d i f f e r e n c e s , these are
given. Also, occasionally forms from other d i a l e c t s are l i s t e d ,
identified by the name of the dialect before the entry.
       P i p i l words are given with both a Spanish and an English gloss.
The Spanish glosses are given p r i m a r i l y in the l o c a l Spanish of
this part of El Salvador. When this d i f f e r s greatly from standard
Spanish or the variants understood in Guatemala and Mexico, a more
general Spanish translation i s also given, i f i t i s known. In some
instances, mainly in the case of names f o r of wild plants and
animals, local Spanish usage i s a l l that i s known. In such cases,
a b r i e f d e s c r i p t i o n i s given. In a few cases the meaning i s not
secure; these are marked with a question mark in parenthesis, i.e.
( ? ) . In cases where the English name of plants or animals i s not
known, i t i s simply listed with the abbreviation sp. standing f o r
""species"", e.g. ""chichipince"", bush sp. Sometimes various names or
distinct pronunciations of a single name f o r the same thing exist
in the l o c a l Spanish. In such cases, the multiple names and pro-
nunciations are listed in the glosses, with f i r s t priority given to
the names used by my consultants.
      The entries also contain morphological information which i s not
p r e d i c t a b l e or i s otherwise i r r e g u l a r .      In unclear cases, the
syntactic category of the word i s signaled by abbreviations (see
l i s t at the beginning of this book) such as t.v. 'transitive verb',
i . v . ' i n t r a n s i t i v e verb 1 , iij_ 'noun', coni., 'conjunction', e t c . In
146particular, nouns are listed with their plurals (pi.) and possessed
forms (poss.), since these are not predictable. Adjectives are
also often given with their plural forms. Similarly, verb entries
are l i s t e d in the present stems (pres.), but t h e i r p r e t e r i t e
( p r ê t . ) and perfect (perf.) forms are also c i t e d , since these, in
e f f e c t , indicate to which verb c l a s s the entry belongs. Since
these verb forms are not always predictable from knowledge of their
verb class, the actual cases provide additional information beyond
class membership. Other morphemes named in the entries, together
with t h e i r abbreviations, are t a - 'unspecified object', causative
(caus.), a p p l i c a t i v e ( a p p l i c . ) , object incorporation (incorp.),
etc. In particular i t i s important to keep in mind that reflexive
verb forms (abbreviated r . v . ) a r e l i s t e d in the d i c t i o n a r y
according to the r o o t , and not by the prefix mu- which they bear.
Thus, a verb root with both active and reflexive forms has only one
entry, but with forms signaled t.v. ( ' t r a n s i t i v e verb') and r.v.
( ' r e f l e x i v e verb'). Verbs which only appear as r e f l e x i v e s are
given with the mu- prefix, but listed alphabetically according to
the root.
      Forms with a hyphen ( - ) contain a morpheme boundary. Thus, a
hyphen appears between the elements of c e r t a i n compound words.
E n t r i e s with the hyphen at the beginning o b l i g a t o r i l y bear some
other morpheme, a p r e f i x . For example, intimately ( s o - c a l l e d
' i n a l i e n a b l y ' ) possessed nouns do not occur without a possessive
pronominal prefix; the presence of a hyphen shows this. Also, the
absolutive suffix of nouns is separated with a hyphen for greater
clarity. Morphemes which have a special shape in compounds or when
incorporated are c i t e d with t h e i r glosses in single quotes, e.g.
ku:- 'head*. When forms occur which are known only from compounds
but do not appear as such elsewhere, they are given with the gloss
in parentheses, e.g. tankwa- ('knee'). Non-lexical, grammatical
morphemes are also cited in single quotes, while other glosses are
found with no special marking or in double quotes (""..."").","[156, 157, 158, 159, 160]"

4.0. Introduction      This description of P i p i l syntax i s not intended as an examina-
tion of the minor syntactic details nor of the profoundly compli-
cated formal questions that so fascinate many modern grammarians.
I t s goal i s , rather, to provide basic information concerning the
structure of sentences and the function of certain syntactic cate-
g o r i e s , and compounds. The t o p i c s considered and t h e i r order of
presentation follow Langacker (1977), except that more morphologi-
cal topics were covered in the last chapter. Many of the examples
are taken from the t e x t s of chapter 7; these are marked with a
l e t t e r and number code, the l e t t e r to i n d i c a t e the text and the
number for the line within i t ( f o r details, see chapter 7).","[112, 113, 114, 115]"

which a l s o c r o s s - r e f e r e n c e f u l l or independent pronoun, noun, and
noun-phrase s u b j e c t s .         These were presented in section 3.2). Here
we turn to the other pronominal a f f i x e s that occur with verbs.
                                                                 75     3.7.4.1. 'Reflexive' (mu-). By the notion ""reflexive"" one does
not usually understand a pronominal form, but the 'reflexive'
m o r p h e m e s in Nahua have typically been treated as pronominal
because in central Mexican dialects they pattern with other prono-
minal prefixes and vary according to person. The 'reflexive'
morpheme of Pipil is mu- with all persons. Its phonological shape
is normally mu in all contexts, including before vowels, where it
is phonetically (muw-) alternating freely with (mw-) is faster
speech. However, there are a few prevocalic cases where it is
simply m - (see 2.2). Some of these appear to have the m - fused as
part of the root and it is no longer recognized as the historical
reflexive that lies behind it. Nevertheless, in these cases there
exist other derivations which show the root without the otherwise
frozen reflexive.          (See below; cf. section 2.2.) Example of
preconsonantal and prevocalic 'reflexive' paradigms are:
       ni-mu-ta:lia        I sit (literally ""I place myself"")
       ti-mu-ta:lia        you (sg.) sit
       mu-ta:lia           he/she/it sits
    ti-mu-ta:lia-t   we sit
    an-mu-ta:lia-t   you (pi.) sit
    mu-ta:lia-t      they sit    ni-mu-a:paka     I wash myself
    ti-mu-a:paka     you (sg.) wash yourself
    mu-a:paka        he/she/it washes hlm-/her-/itself
    ti-mu-a:paka-t   we wash ourselves
    an-mu-a:paka-t   you (pi.) wash yourselves
    mu-a:paka-t      they wash themselvesSome additional examples of reflexive verbs are:   mu-a:pachua       to throw oneself in the water
   mu-chayuntia       to swing
   mu-i:xraimilua     to roll
   mu-i:xmu:tia       to be frightened, afraid
   mu-i:xpa:ka        to wash one's face
   mu-kxi-pa:ka       to wash one's feet
   mu-machtia          to learn (i.e. to teach oneself)
   mu-na:miktia       to get married
   mu-ne:xtia         to show oneself
   mu-sewi            to rest
   mu-tahkwiltia      to braid (one's hair)
   mu-ta:lua          to run
   mu-tapatia         to dress, change clothes
76     mu-ta: sa                 to bump into
     mu-ta:wa:ntia             to get drunk
     mu-techtia                to be sad, become sad
     mu-te:ka                  to lie down
     mu-tu :nalwia             to sun oneself
     mu-tsinta:lia             to squat
     mu-wawana                 to scratch oneselfA few examples of the prevocalic jn- allomorph, together                   with
related non-reflexive forms, are:     m-a:ltia     to bathe (oneself)            k-altia    to bathe
     m-a:wiltia   to play                       k-a:wiltia to paly it
     m-ihtutia    to dance                      k-ihtutia to dance it
     m-i:naya     to hide (oneself)             k-i:naya   to hide it
     m-ihkwani    to remove (self)              k-ihkwani to remove it
     m-isu :tia   to vomit
     m-itu:ni(ya) to sweatA few verbs which are reflexive in form have developed specialized
senses :     m u - c h i w a to grow       (from c h i w a ""tamake"")
     mu-neki         to need       (from neki ""to want"")There is one suppletive form with mu-, derived from a verb but used
as an adjective: mu-e(t)s-tuk ""seated, sitting"".
   With respect to the order of verbal prefixes, subject pronomi-
nale precede mu-, but the object pronominal prefixes and the
reflexive are mutually exclusive, both occupying the ""object""
position.    I n the f e w c a s e s of v e r b s w h i c h b e a r b o t h t h e
'reflexive* and either the (w)al- 'directional' or -el- 'mentation/
inside' (see below) prefixes, the 'reflexive' follows these, e.g.:     (w)al-mu-ne:lwia            to hurry
     el-mu-yawa                  to be nauseated(Cf. 2.2 and 3.7.6.1.)     In the dictionary (chapter 5) reflexive verbs are not listed
independently (under mu- , but rather are found under the verb root
w i t h the abbreviation r.v. to indicate that the root occurs w i t h
the reflexive morpheme.
                                                                77   3.7.4.2. ta- 'unspecified object 1 . In addition to the object
pronominal prefixes already presented, Pipil has another which is
employed to show that the (non-human) object of a transitive verb
is not specified. Verbs with this prefix, ta-, are translated with
an object ""something"" or ""to be doing"" whatever the action of the
verb is, without specifying what the object of the action is; cf.
ni-ta-hkwilua ""I a m      writing"" or ""I write (something)"" /
ni-k-ihkwilua ""I write it"". For example, ta- forms are much used
for answering the question, ""what are you doing?""; the answer might
be, for example, ni-ta-istawia ""I'm salting"".         That is, the
'unspecified object' ta- is natural in contexts where the action of
the verb is in focus and the object is of little relevance, as seen
in these forms:   ni-ta-u:ya                     I am shelling (corn)
     (cf. ni-k-u: ya ""I shell it"")
   ni-ta-ilpia                    I am tying
     (cf. ni-k-ilpia ""I tie it"")
   ni-ta-ku:taraima               I throw something
     (cf. ki-ku:tamima ""he throws it"")Some instances of verbs with ta- are:   ta-chalua        to hit, beat
   ta-chichina      to smoke
   ta-chihcha       to spit
   ta-chiya         to look
   ta-chteki        to steal (cf. k-ichteki ""to steal it"")
   ta-hkwilua       to write (cf. k-ihkwllua ""to write it"")
   ta-hseki         to toast (cf. k-ihseki ""to toast it"")
   ta-htsuma        to sew (cf. k-ihtsuma ""to sew it"")
   ta-ihxihxi: ma   to scrape
   ta-ilpia         to tie
   ta-iskalia       to raise, grow
   ta-istawia       to salt
   ta-(i)xi:ka      to drip
   ta-ixka          to roast
   ta-ki:xtia       to take out
   ta-kwa           to eat
   ta-mana          to cook
   ta-me:wa         to weed
   ta-mali:na       to twist
   ta-patilia       to exchange
   ta-patka:wia     to replant
   ta-paya:na       to grind corn (first pass)
78     ta-pixka         to pick, harvest
     ta-su:ma         to fight, hit
     ta-wiya          to shell (corn)   3.7.4.2.1.  Non-productive and special ta- forms.      In a few
verbs the ta- prefix is no longer optional, but has become a frozen
part of the verb root. Normally, verbs with ta- as the unspecified
object do not permit the simultaneous occurrence of k(i)~, the
'third person singular pronominal object 1 prefix. However, the
verbs with frozen ta- do take the k(i)~ object marker.     In other
cases the optional ta- prefix is added, but either with specialized
semantic senses or irregular phonological outcomes.            Some
instances of both kinds are:     tah-a:na         to pick up (cf. a:na ""to pick up"")
     ta-chpa:na (C)   to sweep (cf. uchpa:na ""to sweep"";
         (t-uchpa:na (SD); normally only initial _i before two conso-
         nants is lost with ta-)
     takwi:ka         to sing (cf. ni-k-takwi;ka ""I sing it"")
     tahkwiltia        to braid (cf. ni-k-tahkwiltia ""I braid it;cf.
         (i)hkwilua ""to write"")
     tahpiya          to watch, care for (cf. piya ""to have"")
     tah-ta-chiya     to gawk, have fun (cf. chiya ""to look"")

         ""blanket"")
     takimiltia       to load (cf. kimil ""load"")
     taksa             to kick (cf. (i)kx(i) ""foot"" + - a transitive
         present')
     takwi            to borrow (cf. kwi ""to take"")
     ta-mati          to imagine, guess (cf. mati ""to know"")
     tane:si          to dawn (cf. ne:si ""to appear, be seen"")
     tatwi, tatwa      t o d a w n ( c f . ita""tosee"", historically
         *(i)twa)   3.7.4.2.2. Reduplication of ta-. The ta- prefix is reduplicated
with iterative verbs or with plural objects, e.g.:     tah-ta-chiya     to look a lot, to have fun
     tah-ta-ketsa     to chat (cf. ta-ketsa ""to talk"")
     tah-ta-mu:ta     to throw (things)(Cf. 3.7.5 for details about verb reduplication.)

the nouns derived from transitive verbs also contain the ta-

    tachani      mirón lizard   (ta-chiya-ni; chiya ""to look"")

                 tortilla   3.7.4.2.4. Adjectives with ta-. A few adjectives and forms
derived from adjectives also bear the ta- prefix, although it is
not always clear how, if at all, these are derived from transitive
verbs. Some examples are:   ta-kwa:wak          hard

means ""hither"", i.e. motion toward the speaker or toward where the
action of the verb takes place. It is derived historically from
wa:lah ""to come"" ('preterite' form). The allomorph w a l - appears
only if no other prefix precedes it; otherwise, the -al- allomorph
occurs. Also, this is the only prefix before which all the subject
pronominal prefixes lose their final vowel, if they have one, e.g.:
    n-al-kl:xtia      I remove it
    t-al-ki:xtia      you (sg.) remove it
    k-al-ki:xtia      he/she/it removes it
    t-al-ki:xtia-t    we remove it
    an-al-ki:xtia-t   you (pi.) remove it
    k-al-ki:xtia-t    they remove it
Some verbs with this prefix, compared to their counterparts without
it, are:    (w)al-ahsi        to find          ahsi       to arrive
    (w)al-a:na        to bring         a:na       to pick up

     (w)al-xi:ni         to scatter        xi:ni      to sprinkle   3.7.6.2. -el- 'mentation/inside 1 . The prefix - e l - is not pro-
ductive and few examples of it exist, but it appears to mean appro-
ximately ""perception by the senses"", that is, mental or emotional
acts, or ""inside"". It appears with verb roots, but also with other
categories as well:     el-ka:wa           to forget (ka:wa ""to leave, abandon"")
     el-mu-yawa         to be nauseated (yawa ""to turn"" (?))

     -el-pets          animal breast
     -el-tapach        liver   3.7.6.3. - a h - 'buccal'. Pipil has forms which suggest another
non-productive verbal prefix now frozen as part of the root, which
probably meant acts done w i t h the mouth, although today this
meaning is far from clear. It also occurs with some non-verbal
forms. The examples are:      ahkamacha:lua     to yawn (cf. ka:machalua (SD) ""to yawn"")
      ahka:na           to blow, fan
                                                                     83    ahketsawetsi      to fall mouth upward (i.e., on one's back;
                         cf. wetsi ""to fall"")
    ahkwe:chiwi       to sneeze (cf. kwe:chiwi ""to be insect-eaten"")
    ahnekua (t.v.)    to smell (cf. ihnekwi ""to smell"" (i.v.))
    ahpu:tsa          to belch, burp (cf. pu:tsua ""to accumulate"")
    ahwa              to bark, scold (cf. wawa- ""to bark"";
                         cf. CN wawaloa ""to bark"")
   ahwa-t             chaff (that which is blown on to rid it
                         from rice, beans, grain, etc.)
    ahwiya-k          delicious   3.7.6.4.  - i h - 'superperficial'. There is evidence of yet
another non-productive, frozen, and rare verb prefix, -ih-, which
seems to have something to do with the surface of objects. Tt also
is not limited to verbs. The examples are:    ihchiki           to scrub
    ihiya             to hate
    ihkwilua           to write (cf. kwikwil- ""colored"")
    ihnekwi           to smell (cf. ahnekua (SD) ""to smell"")
    ihtsilika          to tremble, shiver (cf. tsili:ni ""to ring"")
    ihtsuma           to sew (cf. tsuma (SD) ""to sew"")
    ihxihxi:ma        to scrape (with machete; cf. xi:ma ""to cut
                         hair"")
    ihiyu             smell, breath

"    1.4. Pipil dialectology. Having considered Pipil's ethnohis-
tory and its position relative to other varieties of Nahua, I now
turn to an inspection of Pipil's own regional variation. My origi-
nal intent in studying Pipil dialects was to determine where the
language is still spoken and to obtain a general characterizataion
of local dialect variation. The goal was not to provide an exhaus-
tive account of minor regional differences. The dialect features
presented here, then, give a good idea of major differences among
local dialects, but it does not provide a comprehensive view of
variation within each location. These dialect traits are presented
in broad phonetic representation, not really phonemic, but
employing the Pipil practical alphabet to the extent that it is
possible (see section 2.1).
   (1) In Chiltiupán _ts tends to change to s, e.g. saput ""Zapote""
(from tsaput; susukul ""water jug (cántaro)"" (from tsutsukul); etc.
   (2) In Concepción de Ataco the vowels i^ and ii have been lost
between stops and semivowels, e.g. kwat ""snake""(from ku(;)wat),
kwa ""to buy"" (from kuwa). maltyá ""to bathe"" (from m-a(:)lti(y)a;
the χ is inserted by rule, cf. 2.2). It should also be noticed
that the lost vowel would ordinarily bear stress when in penulti-
mate position and consequently stress is shifted to the final
vowel.
   (3) Originally the final and preconsonantal -1_ of Pipil (and
probably of Proto-Nahua as well) was devoiced (1), but today there
is considerable variation between voiced and voiceless pro-
nunciation in these position and even in other positions in certain
dialects. In Cuisnahuat the voiced and voiceless counterparts vary
rather freely in final position. Final -1 is always voiceless in
Jicalapa. In Teotepeque, the voiceless 1 (1) has been generalized
to all positions; that is, ¿ has changed totally to    everywhere,
e.g. peíu ""dog"", tihian ""chicken"", tekutut ""owl"", kumat ""griddle"",
chiitik ""red"", maitiya ""to bathe"", kai ""house"", etc.
   In Jicalapa, not only is final         devoiced, but 1_ in all
positions is palatalized, lj, prepalatalized finally,          Some
14exampales are: pel^u ""dog"", tihlyan ""chicken"", tekulyut ""owl"",
chakalyin ""shrimp"", el^ut ""ear of corn"", ul y ut ""corncob"", kumayl·
""griddle"", taxka^i ""tortilla"", tuna^t ""sun"", Imamat ""old woman"",
ka?l· ""house"", etc.
   (4) In Teotepeque χ (/δ/) has changed to / V , a retroflexed
fricative, and now is in free variation with rr (/?/). I believe
the later change to rr. is due to Spanish influence. There is
sociolinguistically conditioned variation in local Spanish between
r and '·è, where at least nearby in Guatemala the s   · variant is
stigmatized. I believe that the negative value placed on this
variant in Spanish has contributed to the Teotepeque change to r, a
change in the direction of the prestige variant in Spanish, the
dominant language in this setting. Some examples are:      Suchit /
ruchit ""flower"", suiet / rul-et ""old man"", teskan ""tick1', sukut
""hogplum"", a'san ""now"".
   (5)Teotepeque and Comasaguya have a before ¿ in monosyllabic
roots where others dialects have e¿ e.g. -may ""hand"", -kway
""skirt"".
   (6) Pipil k has several variants in the different dialects, but
in every case the underlying segment remains Je. In Cuisnahuat Jc is
voiced and sometimes fricativized ¿ between two vowels when the
first is long or if both are ji's. Occasionally it is voiced ini-
tially in certain words, particulary frequent with k(i)~ 'third
person sg. pronominal' prefix.     In Santo Domingo de Guzmán k is
voiced    initially, intervocalically, and after n. In Tacuba,
it is voiced between vowels. In the other dialects Jc is generally
maintained without change.
   In all dialects, final η is velar (g) and the stress falls on
the penultimate syllable except for certain Spanish loans,
occasionally the suffix -tsin (cf. section 3.1.3.8), and those
words in Ataco which lost penultimate i. or ji between stops and
semivowels (see above).
   Vowel length is not represented in the list of dialect forms
that follows due to lack of reliable information except for
Cuisnahuat and Santo Domingo de Guzmán, where it was investigated
systematically . It is to be supposed, however, that vowel length
in the other dialects, where it still exists, will be nearly the
same as in these two dialects.
   The following word lists exemplify the changes and variation in
the individual dialects. The abbreviations are:

see C a m p b e l l and Langacker 1978, Canger 1980, Lastra de Suárez
1975, and Sullivan 1980. The least controversial classification of
Uto-Aztecan has eight branches or subgroups:    UTO-AZTECAN
    I. Numic (Plateau Shoshone)
       1. Mono (Monachi), Paviotso
          2. Panamint, Shoshone
          3. Kawaaisu, Ute
    II. TUbatulabal (Kern River)
    III. Takic (Southern California Soshone)
          1. Serrano, +Kitanemuk, +Vanyume, +Alliklik
          2. +Fernandeño, +Gabrieleño, +Nicoleño
          3. Cahuilla, Luiseño, Cupeño, +Juaneño
    IV. Hopi
    V. Piman
          1. Pima, Papago
          2. Northern Tepehuan, Southern Tepehuan
    VI. Taracahitic
          1. Tarahumara
          2. Cahita, Varihio (Guarihio)
          3. Opata
    VII. Cora-Huichol (Corachol)
         1. Cora
         2. Huichol
    VIII. Nahua (Aztecan, Nahuatlan)
         1. +Pochutec
         2. Pipil         3. Core Nahua (all other Nahua varieties)       Note: + = extinct.
   Many proposals exist for higher-order, more inclusive groupings,
and there is now a near consensus that the family first split into
two branches, Northern Uto-Aztecan (which includes groups I-IV
here) and Southern Uto-Aztecan (groups V-VIII). More controversial
proposals have bunched Takic, Numic, and TUbatulabal in a proposed
Shoshonean group and have linked P i m a n and Taracahitic, and at
times Cora-Huichol and Nahua also, in a group called Sonoran.
Miller's (1984) recent classification is intermediate to these:

i s used here to r e f e r t o any v a r i e t y , be i t a d i a l e c t or indepen-
dent language, of the Nahua subgroup. This term i s purposefully
n o n s p e c i f i c to avoid the confusion t h a t other names used in the
l i t e r a t u r e have produced. I t i s important to explain some of these
terms in order to unravel some of this confusion.
       North American linguists tend to speak of the ""Aztec"" language.
This, however, i s unclear because the language i s not a d i r e c t
r e f l e c t i o n of Aztec culture, since i t was spoken contemporaneously
a l s o by non-Aztecs ( e . g . the T l a x c a l a n s ) . Other names which have
been used in reference to v a r i e t i e s of Nahua are: Nahuatl, Nahuat,
Nahuate (Naguate), Mejicano (Mexicano), Mejicano Corrupto (Corrupt
Mexican), P i p i l Nicarao, e t c .          Pochutec of Oaxaca (now e x t i n c t ,
see Boas 1917) i s the most divergent language of the subgroup.
While the case i s l e s s c l e a r , I believe that Central American Pipil
should also be considered a d i s t i n c t language, but more similar to
other v a r i e t i e s than Pochutec i s .      All others are considered dia-
l e c t s of a s i n g l e language, c a l l e d here ""Core Nahua"".         (For more
d e t a i l s concerning Nahua dialectology, see Campbell and Langacker
1978, Canger 1978, 1980, 1983, L a s t r a de Suárez 1974; c f . a l s o
appendices 1 and 2.)
      Above a l l , i t i s important to c l a r i f y the term "" P i p i l "" .                     For
some scholars ""Pipil"" s i g n i f i e s only the Pipil language of Central
America; t h i s i s i t s most common intended meaning in the s c i e n t i f i c
l i t e r a t u r e and i t i s the usage proposed here as the only clear and
acceptable meaning for the term. Nevertheless, frequently ""Pipil""
has been employed not only for Central American P i p i l , but also for
r e f e r i n g t o Nahua d i a l e c t s of southern Veracruz, Tabasco, and
Chiapas (southern Mexican s t a t e s ) ; c f . , for example, Fowler 1981,
1984, García de León 1976, Hasler 1958a, 1958b, 1961, 1976, Knab
1980, Law 1956, Navarrete 1 9 7 5 : 2 7 9 , Reyes Garcia 1958, Swadesh
1954-1955, etc.                  A d e t a i l e d a n a l y s i s ( s e e appendix 1) of the
a v a i l a b l e data shows t h a t a t one l e v e l t h e s e t h r e e v a r i e t i e s ,
C e n t r a l American P i p i l , Chiapas Nahua, and d i a l e c t s of southern
Veracruz and Tabasco, share certain t r a i t s which suggest a possible
c l o s e r h i s t o r i c a l connection among them (Canger 1980, L a s t r a de
Suárez 1974). On the other hand, Central American P i p i l i s in
s e v e r a l r e s p e c t s q u i t e d i s t i n c t from t h e s e and a l l other Nahua
varieties.                 At i s s u e ,      t h e n , i s both t h e name and t h e

d i s t i n c t name in order to avoid confusion. However, the question
of c l a s s i f i c a t i o n i s complicated by the need to interpret both the
shared s i m i l a r i t i e s and the differences. Those who emphasize the
s i m i l a r i t i e s c l a s s i f y C e n t r a l American P i p i l c l o s e r to t h e s e
6v a r i e t i e s , but i t s d i f f e r e n c e s s u g g e s t a c l a s s i f i c a t i o n which
r e f l e c t s greater distance and divergence.
      Among the more marked d i f f e r e n c e s , i t i s worth pointing out the
following:             1) P i p i l has -_t ' p l u r a l ' where o t h e r s have -Ji ( o r
       which c o r r e s p o n d s t o j i in o t h e r d i a l e c t s ) ; c f . s e c t i o n
       3.1.4.
             2) I n P i p i l - t u - k i s t h e ' p e r f e c t ' o r ' p a s t
       p a r t i c i p l e ' ( c f . section 3.7.2.3), while in others -tuk
       / - t o k i s a p r o g r e s s i v e e n d i n g , s o m e t i m e s used
       a d j e c t i v a l l y . For example, i n P i p i l wa:k-tuk means ""dry""
       ( ' a d j e c t i v e ' ) o r "" i t h a s d r i e d "" ( ' p e r f e c t ' ) , but i n
       P a j a p a n , Veracruz corresponding wa:k-tok means ""dry""
       ( ' a d j e c t i v e ' ) but a l s o "" i t i s drying"" ( ' p r o g r e s s i v e ' ) .

                            The Story of a King
                           (Historia de un Rey)       (1) Once there was a king; he had a son. (2) Since he was his
only one, the king loved him, he r e a l l y loved him. ( 3 ) He bought
gold shoes f o r him, he bought gold shoes. (4) But, since he didn't
play outside, he became sad. (5) They had him there a l l alone; he
began to get sick, he started to get i l l .       ( 6 ) His mother — we
mean the queen — , his mother said, "" l e t ' s go take a walk there in
the woods"". ( 7 ) "" L e t ' s go see i f you won't cheer up a b i t . "" ( 8 )
So the went; she took him. (9) There on the plain they arrived at
an old man's house, a l i t t l e old man.
       (10) There there was an old man; he said, ""come in, Señora, come
i n "" . (11) He gave her a block of wood to s i t on; "" s i t down"", he
said. (12) The queen f e l t good that he attended them. (13) She
was happy. (14) "" W e l l "" , the old man said, ""your l i t t l e son i s
sick, he's sick"". (15) ""Yes"", she said, ""he i s s i c k "" . (16) "" A l l
the doctors have come to see i f they could cure him; they haven't
been able t o , they haven't been able."" (17) ""So, he doesn't get
b e t t e r . "" (18) Then the old man said, ""your son needs something.
(19) ""Let him play with other boys, h e ' l l cheer up."" (20) ""Wait"",
he said, ""don't go"", "" w a i t ! "" .   (21) ""My boys are going to come
soon, they're going to play."" (22) And towards the afternoon they
came. (23) The three boys brought some l i t t l e fish, and the other
brought a nest of the mareño bird. (24) ""Oh, look, mama"", said the
l i t t l e boy. (25) ""That's what I wish were mine, that there."" (26)
The l i t t l e boy was happy. (27) The old man t o l d her, ""look, he's
happy to see the l i t t l e birds"". (28) He said to his sons, ""this i s
                                                               893going to be your friend"". (29) ""You'll go and he'll go with you;
he'll go with you to have a good time."" (30) ""He's not here for
you to hit him."" (31) ""He is your friend."" (32) So they went.
(33) They went there to the shores of the lake. (34) There, over
there they looked for some fish and the other one for a bird's
nest. (35) And they found one, they found it. (36) The little boy
was happy, we mean the prince, was happy. (37) Then they returned.
(38) He said to his mother, ""look, look, I brought a little bird"".
(39) ""That's what I wanted, to play."" (40) ""That's what I was
missing."" (41) ""I'm going to throw my shoes away."" (42) ""I'm
going to be barefooted just like my friends are"", he said. (43) He
threw away his golden shoes; his mother picked them up. (44)
""We're going now"", said the old man; ""you go too, but don't forget,
come anytime with your son; here are his friends to play with"".
(45) ""That's what your son needed.""
   (46) Then, since his father was a king, the king died. (47)
The little boy, since now he was a man, became the king, he became
king. (48) Then he remembered his friends; he said, ""I"", he said,
""I remember my friends, how we went to walk there on the shores of
the lake"". (49) ""I'm going to call them."" (50) He called them.
(51) ""Now"", he said, ""I am the king, look"". (52) ""I remembered
you, that you are my friends."" (52) ""That's why I called you.""
(54) ""I am going to give you a position, an office."" (55) ""You
will be a minister, you will be another minister, and you will be
yet another minister."" (56) The prince gave an office to the boys,
since they were men now. (57) That's how far our story goes.

                              (El Nanahuatzin)      (1) Once there was a man who got married. (2) He didn't know
that his w i f e was a witch· ( 3 ) In the nights he i s s l e e p i n g · (A)
His w i f e goes out to walk around. ( 5 ) She takes her head o f f and
goes out to walk around. ( 6 ) Her body remains and only her head
goes. (7) He asked f o r advice and i t was given to him, they gave
him advice. ( 8 ) They t o l d him to smear c h i l i on her. ( 9 ) So he
smear her. (10) The head came in the morning; she was no longer
able to attach h e r s e l f .      (11) She s t r o v e to do i t , but she
couldn't; she began t o c r y , she began to cry. (12) She spoke to
her husband; he didn't pay a t t e n t i o n to her, as though he was
sleeping, but he wasn't asleep. (13) He was seeing what his w i f e
was doing. (14) When he spoke to her the skull throw i t s e l f and
stuck onto his neck. (15) Whatever the man ate she took away from
him, she took i t away, she took everything, whatever he wanted to
eat she took away from him. (16) He could no longer make i t ; he
was going to die. (17) He went to ask f o r more advice; he went to
the church, to the p r i e s t ' s . (18) He should advise him how he
should do i t . (19) So he went. (20) The head did not want to stay
outside in f r o n t of the church, she didn't want t o .            (21) She
didn't want to get down; that's how i t was, she did not want to get
o f f . (22) But f i n a l l y she got down. (23) The man put his jacket
down f o r her; there he l e f t her; the man went inside. (24) He told
the priest that his wife was a witch.
      (25) "" I don't know, but they t o l d me my w i f e i s a witch, that I
should be careful."" (26) ""Each night she goes out to walk abround,
but only her head."" (27) ""All along the stree the dogs howl 'wawa-
wawawawawawawawa', the dogs howl."" (28) ""In the morning she came,
she came again."" (29) ""But since I put c h i l i on her, she no longer
could."" (30) ""Now the p r i e s t t o l d me that i f I have a farm that I
should go with her that she eat the red custard apples that are
ripe, and then I should hit her with the hard ones in order to k i l l
her."" (31) ""But since I was there, I would be t r y i n g t o . ""
      (32) Who knows from where a deer was startled. (33) I t went by
r i g h t there under the zapote t r e e ; the head threw i t s e l f .  (34)
""Lah"" — i t stuck here on the deer (on i t s neck). (35) The deer
took o f f jumping. (36) Into the thorns i t went; i t f e l l in the
ravine — ""rann"" — i t threw i t s e l f into the ravine. (37) ""Pa!"" —
i t f e l l — i t trembled and trembled — the deer died. (38) Then
the s k u l l l e t go; i t stayed there.      (39) The vultures started
908descending. (40) They wanted to eat the meat, the stinking meat of
the deer. (41) She started to scare them, ""shew, shew, shew, shew,
shew!"" (42) ""Don't eat my husband, don't eat my husband!"", that's
what she said to them. (43) Finally the deer dried up and she, the
skull, was going to die all alone there in the canyon. (44) She
died; where she had died a groud tree sprouted.
    (45) The witch (the ""iron-toothed-old-woman"") came. (46) It's
she who is her mother, the witch ""iron-toothed-old-woman"". (47)
She went. (48) She knew where her daughter was. (49) She found
her there. (50) ""Oh, my daughter, you have died here, but here is
my gourd, your gourd of love is coming to come up here."" (51) And
then she left, she went. (52) The tree grew and it had a fruit, a
gourd. (53) The iron-toothed-old-woman sensed it; she came to go
see it. (54) The gourd was just ripe. (55) ""Oh, my daughter, here
is your gourd."" (56) She cut it off, she cut it and took it home.
(57) She put it over there, in the corner of the house she placed
it.
   (58) About a month went by; the gourd was quite ripe. (59) Then
it split open in the middle of the night, let's say at midnight;
you hear it at midnight. (60) ""Pa!"" — it burst open. (61) The
old woman went to see; the seeds of the gourd were just little
boys, they were just little boys. (62) ""Gramma, gramma, gramma""
they said to their grandmother, ""we want little hammocks, gramma"",
they said to her in Spanish. (63) ""Make us little hammocks!"" (64)
""Wait a bit; I'm going to do it."" (65) So she returned and brought
some hammocks. (66) She went to get her little boys, then she went
under the silk-cotton tree, under the silk-cotton tree. (67) She
started to say in magic, ""down silk-cotton tree, down tree, down
tree, down tree, down tree!"" (68) The silk-cotton tree came donw,
down came the silk-cotton tree and its brances touched the ground.
(69) Their grandmother began to hang the hammocks. (70) After-
wards, ""up silk-cotton tree, up tree up, tree""; the silk-cotton
tree went back up. (71) Later they called their grandmother; they
want to get down, get them down. (72) Well, the old woman went.
(73) She got them down; they were already men.
   (74) They said to their grandmother, ""gramma, tomorrow we are
going to go hunt"", they tell her. (75) ""Go ahead, my grandchil-
dren"", she said. (76) They went; they killed a deer. (77) They
skinned it and told their grandmother to cook it; she cooked it.
(78) When the food was ready, since they had stayed up, they slept.
(79) Their grandmother spoke to them; she said, ""wake up, the food
is ready, wake up my children, wake up, the food is ready!"" (80)
They ate the food, they ate the food that they went to catch.
   (81) But their grandmother deceived them because she had a
lover.    (82) She began to call her lover so they could eat
                                                               909together, so she could eat together with her lover. (83) She no
longer gave the food to her grandchildren; she only ate together
with her lover.
   (84) But as the Nanahuatzln was there, the youngest child, he
saw what their grandmother was doing. (85) He told his brothers,
""my grandmother is screwing you; you're not eating"". (86) ""She
just smears grease on your lips so they will taste."" (87) ""Oh
gramma"", they said, ""gramma, we're hungry"" they tell her. (88) ""I
already fed you, but lick your lips"", she said, since she spoke to
them in Spanish, ""lick your lips, you already ate"". (89) She lied;
they had not eaten. (90) The Nanahuatzin, the youngest child, said
to them, ""take me; my grandmother's fellow, he's the one who eats
the food; so take me!11. (91) ""I'm going to show you where he
goes."" (92) ""Go make a trench; go sharpen gUiscoyols (thorny
palms) so he'll stay there, stay there, he's going to die."" (93)
They went and they took him. (94) ""We're going to take our little
brother, gramdmother."" (95) ""No, because he is going to get stuck
with the thorns, he's going to get pricked"", she tells them. (96)
But they took him. (97) ""Make the trench here, but sharpen the
gUiscoyols and put them in the ground."" (98) ""Now our 'bogeyman'
is going to come there and he's going to feel the ""parran"", ""pa"",
he's going to fall."" (99) ""'top, top, top, top"", the thorns are
going to pierce him."" (100) So that's what they did. (101) The
next night, ""plah""; it's their 'bogeyman', ""ah"". (102) ""Let's skin
him"", they said. (103) They skinned him, washed him, and took him
to their grandmother's. (104) ""Look, gramma"", they said to her,
""we brought a deer"", and it was a lie. (105) That was not a deer;
it was the meat of their 'bogeyman', of their grandmother's fellow.
(106) ""Well yes, yes, my children, I'm going to cook it, we're
going to eat."" (107) No, that was not deer, but rather their
grandmother's fellow. (108) It was him that they killed, and they
took the meat so that their grandmother would eat it. (109) The
food was ready. (110) She said to them in Spanish, ""get up my
grandchildren, the food is ready"". (Ill) ""Oh gramma, my head
aches, I'm exhausted"", they say in Spanish. (112) So, she began to
eat alone. (113) ""Sleep now!"", she said in Pipil, ""go to sleep!"".
(114) They went to sleep again. (115) The iron-toothed-old-woman
began to eat the meat. (116) Afterwards they said, ""how did you
find the meat, grandmother?"". (117) ""Delicious my sons, delicious
my sons, soft."" (118) ""That was our bogeyman's flesh"", they said.
(119) ""Oh, it was shit, it was shit, oh."" (120) She felt like
throwing up, but she couldn't.
   (121) ""Ha, I know that the youngest child has advised you, he
has advised you."" (122) ""Well, that's all right, so be it, but I'm
going to kill that youngest child."" (123) She was wanting to kill
910
him. (124) She went to sharpen her teeth, there by the edge of the
canyon she sharpened her teeth so she could eat the l i t t l e boy.
(125) She was going to b i t e him.
      (126) The other said to the lizard, ""look lizard"", in Spanish he
said, ""go see what my gramma i s doing"", he said in Spanish. (127)
"" I ' l l go"", i t was the l i z a r d ; the l i z a r d went. (128) He went by
and saw that she was sharpening her teeth, she was sharpening her
teeth. (129) The lizard returned. (130) ""She hit me with a rock"",
he said. (131) ""The piece of t i l e stuck here (pointing to the back
of the neck); she found a piece of t i l e and she busted my head.""
(132) ""OK, but my grandmother i s going to see what's going to
happen.""
      (133) Later in the evening she was coming with her wash. (134)
They s a i d , "" l o o k grandmother, we're going to make a b e t ; whoever
p a s s e s h i s / h e r p i s s on top of the house we don't want to k i l l "" .
(135) ""Whoever does not get h i s / h e r p i s s there we a r e going to
k i l l . "" (136) Then the men began, "" c h i r r "" ; another went, "" i r r "" .
(137) ""Now grab our grandmother; l e t her pass her piss."" (138) She
took off running she closed herself in the house. (139) They tied
the rings (of the door) and set f i r e to the house. (140) There the
iron-toothed-old-woman met her end.

1. Introduction    In this appendix the position of Pipil is considered and
clarified w i t h respect to 1) other varieties of Nahua that are
sometimes also called ""Pipil"" and 2) the classification of Nahua in
general and Pipil's position within it.","[908, 909, 910, 911, 912, 913, 914, 915, 916, 917, 918, 919, 920, 921, 922, 923, 924, 925, 926, 927]"
"
                          The Hurricaners
         (Los Huracaneros, English narrative translation)   (1) I remember what my grandmother and my grandfather told me.
(2) In those days there came ""hurricaners"" from a town called
Chilteopan. (3) When they say there is going to be a big storm, so
they say, in the wind that comes by there come men and women in the
wind such that they come to carry off ears of corn for them to eat.
(4) Thus the milpas were left broken, quite flattened, with many
ears of corn disfigured with a look like pustules. (5) Those were
the ears of corn that the Chilteopaners took, according to my
grandfather and my grandmother.
   (6) But in this case, once there was a smart man who held that
what they came to do in our town was too much. (7) So he made a
trap. (8) In the trap he was able to catch a girl of about
eighteen. (9) But at the moment she fell to the ground, immediate-
ly the girl changed into a turkey. (10) Then the man who caught
and grabbed the turkey took it to his house. (11) Immediately he
ordered his wife to kill the turkey so they could eat it. (12) So
his wife killed the turkey, plucked it, and made the food, and they
ate it. (13) But what they noticed was that the dog did not eat
the turkey's bones and feathers. (14) Then the whole family was
left puzzled because the dog wouldn't eat the bones nor the
feathers. (15) On the third day after the storm had passed and
they had eaten the turkey, there came two men and a woman to look
872for it. (16) They arrived at the house of the m a n w h o had caught
it because they more or less already knew who had caught it. (17)
But the did not tell the truth, but rather arrived asking if by
chance he had seen a girl pass near his house the day of the big
storm. (18) W h a t he answered w a s that he had not seen a girl.
(19) What he had found on open ground was a turkey. (20) Then he
caught it and took it home and told his wife to kill it and make
the food, and they ate it. (21) Then the three said, ""well, what
you have done is all right, but I want you to do me a favor"". (22)
""Show me, at least, where the feathers are, where the bones were
left, so I can go see where they are"". (23) Then the man went to
show them. (24) The three came to where the feathers and bones
were that the dog had not eaten. (25) Then they picked up the
bones, made a pile, and asked for a trough and a lot of water and a
spool of thread, and they throw it into the air. (26) Soon it
thrundered. (27) When it thundered he saw that it just turned
around. (28) In the turn that it made it raised and disappeared.
(29) Actually, they took the girl because at the moment the man saw
that they tried this, he saw perfectly (well) that a beautiful girl
came out of the bones and feathers.
     (30) So, the ""hurricaners"" in reality come from Chilteopan; they
c o m e to take ears of corn to eat. (31) But they were screwed up,
because they killed the girl and ate her. (32) That's what my
grandfather and grandmother told me, and big storms always come,
but we never saw if one c a m e to fall. (33) So, today I a m telling
this to my friend so he can take this story with him as a
remembrance.

"This list shows that there are dialects w h i c h are not of the
Eastern group that have the -me-h / -me-t ending and that there are
Eastern (Isthmus) dialects which lack it (e.g. Boquiapan, Cupilco,
Tuxtlas, etc.).    It is very possible that - m e - h / - m e - t w a s the
original Proto-Nahua plural ending in pronouns, which would mean
that it represents a retention in those dialects that have it, not
a shared innovation. Therefore, these dialects could have retained
the trait regardless of their actual classification by simply not
having changed the prior existing form. In any case, its geogra-
phical distribution shows that this feature is not diagnostic for
the classification of Nahua dialects and has no direct relevance to
the position of Pipil.
   Pipil, the Sierra de Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua also share the
retention of initial      w h i c h changed to ye- in many other dia-
lects, as in, for example, e:-t(l) ""bean"" instead of ye:-t(l). But
certain other dialects also preserve e-, e.g. La Huasteca, Jalisco,
etc., and even in Classical Nahuatl e^ varied w i t h ye. The e^ is a
retention of a Proto-Nhaua characteristic; the change of       to ye-
is a relatively recent innovation. Therefore, Pipil and others
could share    irrespectively of their classification (cf. Canger
1978:8).
   These three, Pipil, Sierra de Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua, also
share another trait, the preservation of the root-final v o w e l in
the words toto(:)nik ""hot"" and xoxo:wik ""green""; cf. CN toto:nki
and xoxo:wki (Canger 1978:8). This attribute is not diagnostic
                                                                931for the classification, either, since La Huasteca Nahua also has it
and, moreover, because it represents a retention of the original
form which could be shared without any historical connection after
the split up of Proto-Nahua. The loss of the root-final vowel
represents an innovation in the dialects which underwent it. In
any case, it is also possible that the Pipil form tutu:nk-a:yu-t
""fever"" evidences the change.
   These three varieties share yet another trait; they have changed
the *tl of Proto-Nahua to _t (cf. Campbell and Langacker 1978), but
this change is so natural that it very easily could have taken
place independently, as is suggested by the fact that a number of
other dialects also share this change (cf. Canger 1980:88-9).
   Canger also pointed out that these three (Pipil, Sierra de
Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua) also tend to lose the absolutive suffix
after     (Canger 1978:13), but the circumstances of this loss vary
in each of the three and also, the same tendency is found in
certain other dialects, e.g. in Tlaxcala Nahua (Canger 1978:13).
In Pipil the absolutive has been lost completely with roots ending
in     but also it tends to be lost in other environments. For
example, one of its allomorphs, -ti, occurs after other consonants
(not -1) but is limited for the most part to monosyllabic forms,
save a few exceptions (see section 3.1.1). In Isthmus Nahua the
absolutive allomorph that occurs after final -1_ (i.e. -li) has
been lost only in polysyllabic nouns, while in Sierra de Puebla
Nahua it was lost in this same environment and also in monosyllabic
nouns with a long vowel. Had the loss of absolutive been histori-
cally shared, the only portion of it that one could assume to be
genetic would be the suppression of the allomorph after root-final
   in polysyllabic forms — but not even this small portion of it
is useful for genetic classification, given that Tlaxcala Nahua
also shares that much of the loss.
   Canger also pointed out traits shared only be Pipil and Isthmus
Nahua. These may be more important, although their significance
for genetic classification is not easily determined. Among these
she cites an Isthmus construction with nemi plus a main verb which
results in a kind of progressive: nemi ni-takwa ""I am eating"". In
Pipil this progressive construction is composed of a clear
auxiliary verb, nemi, which means ""to be"" in other contexts.
However, the constructions meaning and function in Isthmus Nahua
varies with the local dialects. For example, García de León tran-
slates it as ""go (about) doing"" (Sp. andar haciendo) in Pajapan,
Veracruz, where he describes the construction as a ""frase verbal
continuativa"":    nemi mawiltia ""anda jugango"".      El uso de esta frase
932      sustituye en mucho al uso del sufijo continuativo -tok de
      los verbos. (García de León 1976:74)Here it is composed of a verb nemi ""to walk, go"" (andar) plus main
verb (cf. CN nemi ""to live"", nehnemi ""to go, walk""). On the other
hand, Wolgemuth (1980:107) presents it as a true progressive con-
struction, e.g. nemi ni-takwa ""I am eating"". In Pipil, one might
expect a progressive construction from a verb meaning ""to be"", as
is the case in many other languages of the world, e.g. English ""I
am eating"" or Spanish ""estoy comiendo"". Moreover, Isthmus Nahua
has a progressive suffix, -tok, as do several other varieties of
Nahua, which Pipil lacks. Therefore, while Pipil and Isthmus Nahua
share a similarity in this case, it is possible that it is due to
independent innovation of the progressive construction, just as was
the case with English and Spanish, related languages which indepen-
dently developed progressives from forms of the verb ""to be"".
Other dialects also contain auxiliary constructions with nemi, but
with it postposed, e.g. mo-laluhti-nemi ""(he) goes (about) running""
(anda corriendo) in Michoacan Nahua (Beller and Beller 1979:282),
wikati-nemi ""sings habitually"" in La Huasteca Nahua (Sischo
1979:355), while Tetelcingo has an 'ambulative' construction,
-ti-nemi (Brewer 1969:46), to which CN kwala:n-ti-nemi ""to go
(around) getting angry"" (andar enojándose) may be compared. It is
also possible, however, given the greater similarity in form and
meaning, that Pipil and Isthmus Nahua share this trait due to some
common history; at this time, it is simply unclear.
   Canger's second feature shared by Pipil and Isthmus Nahua is
-pal 'possession', e.g. i-pal ""his/hers/its"", no-pal / nu-pal
""mine"", etc. Other dialects have a cognate relational noun -pal,
but generally with the basic meaning of ""by, with, near, by means
of, for"". However, these also have contexts with a possessive
sense, e.g. CN te:-pal ""someone's"" (ajeno). At the same time,
Pipil has contexts with the meaning ""by, for"", e.g. pal ""by, for,
in order to"" (conjunction), ""of, from, by"" (possessive,
directional). It is possible that Pipil and Isthmus Nahua have
innovated together the basic sense of possession, but this is by no
means clear.
   Finally, Canger (1978:14) presented certain lexical items shared
by Pipil and Isthmus Nahua, but these are not shared exclusively by
these two varieties (nor by these plus Sierra de Puebla Nahua).
For example, koyame-t / kuyame-t ""pig"" is found in Pipil, Isthmus
Nahua, Michoacan, and Quetzalapa; others tend to have pitso-t(l).
The form teksis-t(l)i ""egg"" is found in Pipil,      Isthmus,    and
La   Huasteca;    others   have totol-te- t(l). tle-tl. tli-tl, or
                                                                933tlexuch-tli.
   In sum, these similarities may suggest a possible closer genetic
connection between Pipil and Isthmus Nahua (and perhaps these two
with the Sierra de Puebla), but their genetic significance is
inconclusive and Pipil's striking differences (cited above) should
be kept in mind.","[946, 947, 948, 949]"
"     In spite of Lehmann's influence, most modern investigators have
accepted Torquemada's account as accurate, and joining it with
Oviedo's, they have proposed a reasonable picture of Pipil ethno-
history. According to their reconstructions (cf. particularly
J i m é n e z Moreno 1966:63-7), the Pipils left the area of Cholula,
Puebla (specifically Ticomega and Maguatega) in order to escape the
tyranny of the historical Olmecs. They came to southern Veracruz,
but shortly after were displaced again, arriving in Xolotlan (the

we would be in a better position to explain the nature of the
postulated relationship shared by Pipil, Isthmus (Gulf), and Sierra
de Puebla Nahua. Given the consensus that the Pipil left central
Mexico and migrated first to the southern Gulf region, it is to be
expected that the Pipil language would share some linguistic traits
with varieties from that area. The question remains, however,
about how the differences are to be understood and about how long
Pipil has been separated from whatever its nearest neighbors or
relatives may be (see appendix 1).","[25, 26, 27]"
"   3.7.2.1. Present. The tense traditionally called 'present' in
Pipil covers m o m e n t a n e o u s (e.g. ""I eat (now)""), habitual (""I
(always, characteristically) eat""), and frequently present progres-
sive (""I'm eating"") senses.         It bears no special affixes, although
the root-final vowel is maintained. Transitive verbs very fre-
quently have an - a which signals transitivity, and some transitive
verbs are distinguished from corresponding intransitives solely by
the presence of this -a. The following examples of third person

-tu- 'past participle' plus -lc (probably in origin the 'preterite')
in the singular and    iwi—t in the plural· The —tu— suffix also
occurs in other combinations, e.g.-tu-ya(-t) (cf. section 3.7.6.1)
and -tu-skiya(-t) (cf. section 3.7.2.4.1). The meaning of -tu-k/-
tiwi-t is 'perfect', both 'present perfect' and 'past perfect',
e.g. ni-k-chiw-tuk ""I have done it"", ""I had done it"". It refers to
past action with present relevance. That is, the 'perfect' refers
to an event in the past which has relation to the present
situation.    Its use in the texts of chapter 7 give the best
indication of its meaning and function.   Some examples of its form
are:   Class I
   chiwa   to do,     -chiw-tuk       -chiw-tiwi-t
             make       (he) has done    they have done

e.g. the 'conditional' and the 'imperfect'; cf. the next section,
3.7.2.4.1 and section 3.7.6.1.)   3.7.2.4. 'Conditional'.     The conditional suffix is -skiya
'singular' and -skiya-t 'plural'. It is normally attached to the
verb root, which is the same as the 'present' stem — that is, the
stem-final vowel is present. However, the verbs of Class III which
end in -ia and -ua in the 'present', -ih and -uh in the 'preterite'
and 'perfect' attach the suffix to the root without the root-final
vowel and also without the ji, e.g. pulua ""to lose"", ni-k-pulu-skiya
Ί would lose it"" (cf. ni-k-pulua ""I lose it"", ni-k-puluh ""I lost
it"", ni-k-puluh-tuk ""I have lost it""). This suffix is called
'conditional' in the literature; it has the approximate meaning of
68""would"" in English. However, speakers at times tend to translate
these forms with the equivalent of ""want"" or ""would like to"". This
'desiderative' connotation may ultimately be due to Spanish
influence, since it is often translated into Spanish with the
subjunctive and Spanish subjunctives can have both the
'conditional' and the 'desiderative' senses. The 'conditional'
paradigm of panu ""to pass"" is:     ni-panu-skiya                   I would pass
     ti-panu-skiya                    you (sg.) would pass
     panu-skiya                      he/she/it would pass
     t i-panu-skiya-t                we would pass
     am-panu-skiya-t (/an-/)         you (pi.) would pass
     panu-skiya-t                    they would pass   3.7.2.4.1.  'perfect conditionals'.     There is also a quite
infrequent 'perfect conditional' composed of -tu- 'past participle'
(cf. -tu-k, -tiwi-t) plus -skiya(-t) 'conditional, with the meaning
""would have"", e.g.:     ahsi-tu-skiya             she would have arrived
     ni-k-taxtah-tu-skiya      I would have paid it
     yah-tu-skiya              he would have gone
     yah-tu-skiya-t            they would have gone

very rare. Usually future meanings are given in periphrastic
constructions, e.g. ni-yu ni-k-chiwa, literally ""I'm going to do
it"". In this, Pipil is very similar to local Spanish, where the
periphrastic forms, e.g. lo voy a hacer (cf. ni-yu ni-k-chiwa) ""I'm
going to do it"" are the most typical, with future forms such as lo
haré (cf. ni-k-chiwa-s) ""I will do it"" rare and stilted. The
Pipil future suffixes are -s^ 'singular' and -s-ke-t 'plural'; they
are similar to the 'conditional' in that normally they are attached
to the verb root ('present' stem) with the final vowel present,
though Class III verbs lack the root-final vowel and the li of other
tenses and aspects, e.g. pulu-ske-t ""they will lose it"" (cf. puluh-
ke-t ""they lost it""). The panu ""to pass"" 'future' paradigm is:
                                                                     69    ni-panu-s                 I wiii pass
    ti-panu-s                 you (sg.) will pass
    panu-s                    (he/she/it)will pass
    ti-panu-ske-t             we will pass
    am-panu-ske-t (/an-/)     you (pi.) will pass
    panu-ske-t                they will passIn Culsnahuat these rare futures are most often found w i t h the
adverbs xa:n ""later, afterwards"" and mu:sta ""tomorrow"", as in:   xa:n ni-k-kwa-s           later I will eat it
   xa:n ti-k-kwa-s           later you will eat it
   xa:n ki-kwa-s             later he/she/it will eat it
   xa:n ti-k-kwa-ske-t       later we will eat it
   xa:n an-ki-kwa-ske-t      later you (pi.) will eat it
   xa:n ki-kwa-ske-t         later they will eat it   mu:sta ti-k-kwa-s nakatamal     tomorrow you will eat tamales
   yaha rau:sta ki-kwa-s nakatamal tomorrow he will eat tamales
   mu:sta ti-ya-s                   tomorrow you will go
   mu:sta ya-s                      tomorrow he will go   3.7.2.6. 'Desiderative 1 . Pipil has a 'desiderative' composed
of 'future' - s plus neki, historically from the verb root ""to
want"". It has the form: pronouns+verb+s+neki(+plural).   The con-
struction means ""to want to do the action expressed by the verb"".
Some examples are:   naha ni-k-kwa-s-neki             I want to eat it
   taha ti-k-kwa-s-neki             you (sg.) want to eat it
   yaha ki-kwa-s-neki               he/she wants to eat it
   tehemet ti-k-kwa-s-neki-t        we want to eat it
   an-ehemet an-ki-kwa-s-neki-t     you (pi.) want to eat it
   yehemet ki-kwa-s-neki-t          they want to eat it   3.7.2.7. 'Imperfect'.       The suffix - y a 'imperfect' indicates
continuous past actions, best translated into English as ""used to
do"" or ""was doing"" the action of the verb. It is equivalent to the
Spanish 'imperfect past' which ends in - i a or - a b a , e.g. c o m i a
""(she) was eating"", c a m i n a b a ""(he) used to walk"". It is employed
rather seldom in present-day Pipil. Some examples are:
70     ni-tawi:kilia-ya     I owed (him money for some time)
     ki-na:maka-ya         he used to sell/was selling it   3.7.2.7.1. -tu-ya 'past imperfect'.    The suffix -tu-ya is
exceedingly rare in today's usage. It is composed of the 'past
participle' -tu- (cf. -tu-k, -tiwi-t, section 3.7.2.3) plus the
'imperfect' -ya. It essentially means an action which continued in
the past but is now ended, e.g.:      ni-k-ltskih-tu-ya    I had been grabbing it
      ni-k-chiw-tu-ya      I had been doing it
      ti-k-chiw-tu-ya      we used to be doing itIt should be noted that the 'imperfect' is distinct from the clitic
-a/-ya ""already, now"", and should not be confused with it (cf.
section 3.8.1).","[79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84]"

"   3.7.3.1. Class I ((C)VCV) verbs. Class I verbs typically lose
their root-final vowel in the 'preterite' and 'perfect'. Some lose
the vowel only in the 'perfect' and not in the 'preterite' (cf. the
vowel-loss rules, section 2.2). Class I verbs are characteristi-
cally of the shape (C)VCV, but do not include the (C)Vka or (C)VCu
forms of Class II. Loss of the root-final vowel in these verbs
creates no consonant clusters of more than two members. The
'preterite' with this class is normally -ki or       except in the
case of certain intransitive verbs which keep the root vowel in the
                                                                 71

largest group is Class II. These verbs do not lose their root-
final vowel in the 'preterite' or the 'perfect'. The majority are
characterized by the phonological shapes: (C)VCCV, (C)Vka, and
72(C)VCu — the shapes that resist vowel-loss either because other-
wise impermissible consonant clusters would arise, or because -ka
and -τι are not subject to the rule (cf. section 2.2). Neverthe-
less, there are some verbs of this class which have none of these
phonological patterns, but fail to undergo vowel loss. The form of
the 'preterite' of Class II verbs is -Jc in the singular (all
classes have -ke-t in the plural). Some examples are:     ahsi         arrive         patska      to milk, twist
     ahwa         to scold       pixka       to pick, harvest

     maka         to give        tsahtsi     to shout
     mu:ta         to throw at   uksi        to cook
     naka         to stay        uni         to drink
      (also Class I)
     namaka       to sell        weli        to be able to
     ne: si       to appear      wetska      to laugh
     pa:ka        to wash        wi:ka       to take
     pata         to change      xu:ta       to wound
     pa: ti       to melt   3.7.3.3. Class III (-ia, -ua). The verbs of Class III end in
-ia or -ua in the 'present'; in the 'preterite' and 'perfect' their
roots end in -ih and -uh; and in the 'conditional' and 'future'
forms their roots end in plain -i_ and -u. Phonetically in the
'present' these are (-iya) and (-uwa) and are not phonetically
distinct from verbs with underlying /-iya/ (and /-uwa/). They
are morphophonemically distinct, however, given that these latter
are either -iya-k or -ix(-k) in the 'preterite'. Historically it
is probable that Pre-Proto-Nahua had an intervocalic li which was
lost in Class III verbs (i.e. -iha, -uha) in their present stems.
This accounts for why ji is present in the 'preterite' and 'perfect'
forms of this class; the ti was not intervocalic here and hence was
not lost. We might further postulate that this historical Ji was
lost in the 'conditionals' and 'futures' of this class because it
would have otherwise created a consonant cluster of more than two
members (e.g. -iK-skiya, -uK-s-ke-t) or two consonants at the end
                                                                    73
of a word (e.g. - i K - s 'singular future 1 ). Also, historically the
verbs with a short vowel before w plus a_ (i.e. -Vwa) changed ulti-
mate to - u a (cf. Canger 1980). This change is evident in Pipil
reflexes as in the pairs of verbs where the transitive has -ua and
the corresponding intransitive has -Vwi. e.g.:   ihtakawi      to break down    ihtakua     to take apart, ruin
   kwe:chiwi     for corn to be   kwe:chua    to grind finely
                   insect-eaten
   kwe:liwi      to curve, bend   kwe:lua     to bend (something)   Thus it seems that historical - V w a became -uha and later the li
was lost intervocalically, giving -ua, but preserved finally and

change of syllable-final w to h (cf. Campbell and Langacker 1978).

with a very high frequency.
      Having defined the verb c l a s s e s , we may now return to the r e s t
of the verb morphology.","[84, 85, 86, 87, 88]"
"      (3) Devoiclng of sonorants. As mentioned above, P i p i l has a
rule which devoices non-nasal f i n a l and preconsonantal sonorants
(ï.t i> i » aid Jl)» which has both allophonic and morphophonemic
e f f e c t s . Today t h i s rule presents considerable v a r i a t i o n in the
different dialects, but i t i s s t i l l in force (cf. section 1.4). By
t h i s rule, final        not only becomes voiceless, but changes to jc as
w e l l , i f the χ i s not of recent o r i g i n in the language. To t h i s
extent, the rule has morphophonemic outcome, given that χ an£ l iL a r e
contrastive segments. The alternation of 1_ with              and w with W,
(and of χ with Y_ in the forms of recent o r i g i n ) i s a matter of
allophonic variants, the v o i c e l e s s allophone found only in word-
f i n a l or pre-consonantal position. The following are some examples
of the alternation of χ with jç:   chiya ""to look""                    -chix-ki ""looked""
   piva ""to have""                     -pix-ki ""had""
   tayi ""to clear ground""             - t a x - k i ""cleard ground""
   u:ya ""to shell (corn)""             -u:x-ki ""shelled""      (4) Loss of h. In P i p i l Jh can appear f i n a l l y , before conso-
nants, and a t the end of a reduplicated f i r s t s y l l a b l e , but in
other contexts the *Ji of Proto-Nahua i s l o s t . This has produced an
a l t e r n a t i o n between ji and 0. I t explains the verbs of c l a s s I I I
which in the ' p r e s e n t ' end in - i a ( p h o n e t i c a l l y - i y a and -ua
(phonetically -uwa), but in other tenses or aspects end in - i h and
-uh. H i s t o r i c a l l y such verbs bore an ji between the f i n a l two
34vowels ( * - i h a and * - u h a ) , which was l o s t when i t came t o be i n
i n t e r v o c a l i c p o s i t i o n . A few examples which show the p r e s e n c e
versus absence of ji in such verbs a r e :       sa:lua ""to s t i c k , glue""                s a : l u h - k e - t ""they glued""
       talua ""to run""                              taluh-tuk ""has run""
       k - i l p i a ""(he) t i e s i t ""           k - i l p i h - t u k ""has t i e d i t ""
       k i - t a : l i a ""(he) puts i t ""          k i - t a : l i h - k e - t "" t h e y put i t ""Although these verbs appear phonetically with ¿ or w before a, t h i s
χ and w can be predicted from t h e i r i n t e r v o c a l l i c position. Such
verbs contrast with those that have ¿ or w as part of t h e i r under-
lying form and therefore do not lose these sounds in other tenses
or aspects, e.g. t i : l t i y a ""to become black"", t i : l t i y a - k "" i t became
b l a c k "" ; i t u : n i y a "" t o s w e a t "" , i t u : n i x - k i ""(he) sweat ( p a s t ) "" ( c f .
kuwa "" t o buy"", puwa "" t o c o u n t "" ) . P i p i l , then, has two r u l e s which
describe these phenomena:       Rule 3) J i - l o s s : an i n t e r v o c a l i c h. ( p a r t i c u l a r l y b e f o r e
       the l a s t vowel) i s l o s t . This does not apply to redupli-
       cated f i r s t s y l l a b l e s .","[47, 48]"
"Forms with epenthetic _i contrast with others which have underlying
Í , which does not disappear with p r e f i x e s , e.g. n u - i h t i ""my
stomach"", (Cuisnahuat) t a - i s k a l i a "" t o be c r e a t i n g (something)"",
e t c . The r u l e i s , then:      Rule 2) Vowel p r o t h e s i s : an i^ i s prothesized to forms
      which begin with two consonants i f these are not preceded
      by a prefix which ends in a vowel.",[47]

2.    Other Varieties of Nahua Sometimes Called ""Pipil""    Given the confusion and controversy occasioned by the use of
""Pipil"" in reference to other southern varieties of Nahua and by
claims that these and Central American Pipil may be close genetic
relatives, it is important to compare these in greater detail.
This examination is intended to help resolve the issues. The forms
compared are from Soyaló, Chiapas (principal examples from Reyes
1961a, c o m p l e m e n t e d by forms from Van Zantwijk 1963, cited in
parentheses; from Huehuetán, Chiapas (Bruce and Robles Uribe 1969,
with a few forms cited from Knab 1980 in parentheses) ; from Pueblo
Nuevo Solistahuacán, Chiapas (Navarrete 1975); from Bochil, Chiapas
(Van Zantwijk 1963); from Salamá, Guatemala (Stoll 1958(1884¿);
from Pajapan, Veracruz (García de León 1976); from Mecayapan,
Veracruz (Wolgemuth 1981); and from San Felipe Río Nuevo, Cardenas,
Tabasco (Rendón n.d.). First a comparative word list is presented,
followed by comments. The abbreviations used are:     Mec   =   Mecayapan, Veracruz

   To begin with, some clarifications of these data are in order.
They are written as in the original sources, only transliterated to
follow the Pipil practical orthography. Soyaló and Pueblo Nuevo
Solistahuacán contain an automatic glottal stop after final vowels;
this is found in many varieties of Nahua, including Pipil, but not
written because it is predictable.
   Intervocalic lc is also voiced in several varieties. However,
this is an independent change, not useful for classification.      It
is variable in Pipil, some dialects having no voicing of lc, w h i l e
others have considerable, e.g. Santo Domingo de Guzmán with voicing
                                                                                                    923i n t e r v o c a l i c a l l y , i n i t i a l l y and a f t e r 11 ( c f . s e c t i o n 1.4 f o r more
d e t a i l s ) . Huehuetán has a voiced f r i c a t i v e (g) i n t e r v o c a l i c a l l y ,
e.g. -maga "" t o g i v e "" , which i s a l s o found in some o t h e r d i a l e c t s .
Soyaló seems to give preference to v o i c e l e s s lc, but in v a r i a t i o n a t
times with                e.g. - n e k i / - n e g i ""to want"". In Salamá, Guatemala the
change to voiced f r i c a t i v e s i n t e r v o c a l i c a l l y has apparently reached
a l l the s t o p s , not j u s t k. T h i s i s not always obvious i n S t o l l ' s
(1958(1884)) orthography, but i t i s not d i f f i c u l t to see when a few
forms a r e compared.                     For 2. t h e r e a r e examples such as t e v e t
""mountain"" ( c f . t e p e : t o f o t h e r s ) , neva / bja "" t h e r e "" ( c f . ne:pa
elsewhere), and cáva ""where"" ( c f . kampa of others). These repre-
sentations with ]> and v^ suggest a phonetic voiced b i l a b i a l f r i c a -
t i v e (fe). For _t there are such examples as - i d a ""to see"" and medat
""quern ( m e t a t e ) "" , where o r t h o g r a p h i c ¿ could s u g g e s t e i t h e r a
voiced f r i c a t i v e ( è ) or a voiced s t o p (d). Examples f o r lc vary
between orthographic                      and        as in tuga / tua ""name"", niga ""here"",
e t c . Salamá a l s o suffered another change with lc; i t was l o s t a f t e r
h., e.g. weha "" f a r "" ( c f . P i p i l wehka), ahu ""up"" ( c f . P i p i l ahku),
tehu "" t o go up"" ( c f . P i p i l t e h k u ) , e t c . P r e c o n s o n a n t a l l y Salamá
a l s o changed _ts t o              and cji t o         but t h i s change i s found in many

Pa japan has changed k_w t o J), a phenomenon found i s s e v e r a l o t h e r
Gulf Coast d i a l e c t s .
      Mecayapan, l i k e many o t h e r kinds of Nahua, has an a u t o m a t i c
p h o n e t i c g l o t t a l s t o p a f t e r f i n a l vowels, but t h e -_t and -Jc i n

t i n c t , the one from f i n a l -t_ and -k being stronger (Wolgemuth 1969,
Canger 1980:70).              Mecayapan monosyllabic forms ending in -t_, how-
e v e r , have not undergone t h e f u l l change t o g l o t t a l s t o p , but
r a t h e r have i n s e r t e d a g l o t t a l stop b e f o r e t h e            e.g. a : ? - t
""water"", t e ? - t ""stone"", t i ? - t "" f i r e "" .          F i n a l l y , Mecayapan words
ending i n - i ( y ) a or -o(w)a have changed with t h e a c c e n t on the

9243.    P i p i l and the classification of Nahua        With the argument presented in chapter 1 that Central American
P i p i l must in some way be considered d i s t i n c t from other Nahua
v a r i e t i e s , the question i s begged, j u s t what i s the p o s i t i o n of
P i p i l within the Nahua subgroup and how does i t r e l a t e to other
dialects?           In the classification proposed here, Nahua consists of
three ""branches"" (independent languages): Pochutec, P i p i l (of
Central America), and Core Nahua ( t o which a l l other v a r i e t i e s
belong, including the s o - c a l l e d "" C l a s s i c a l "" — a l i a s Colonial —
Nahuatl (CN) of the sixteenth century and the various extant
d i a l e c t s of Mexico).      Other c l a s s i f i c a t i o n s which have been
proposed generally coincide with this one in considering Pochutec
as the most divergent member of the group, a separate language.
Nevertheless, several of the proposals d i f f e r in that they group
P i p i l among the dialects of Core Nahua or as a subdivision of some
other imagined Nahua dialect arrangement.
    These claims require some examination, although a l l have been
superseded by Una Canger's studies. For that reason, d e t a i l e d
discussion of the dialect t r a i t s upon which classification has been
based i s reserved for l a t e r , f o r the presentation of Canger's case
(see below). For proposals prior to Canger's, I present only the
main claims with respect to the position of P i p i l .
   Swadesh (1954-1955:179) held Pochutec and Mexihca ( i . e .
Classical Nahuatl) to be distinct languages, where ""todas las demás
forman una red dialectal"", specified in more detail as:       Los datos indican que e l nahua se d i v i d e en t r e s partes
       representadas respectivamente por e l pochuteco, e l nahua
       c l á s i c o o mexihca, y no hay d i a l e c t o s t r a n s i c i o n a l e s
       entre e l pochuteco y l o s demás, ni tampoco entre e l
       mexihca y l o s otros. Aparte de l o s dos t i p o s aislados,
       e l r e s t o forma una sola red d i a l e c t a l con d i f e r e n c i a s
       paulatinas entre pueblo y pueblo desde l a Huasteca
       hasta San Salvador ( P i p i l ) y desde Veracruz hasta e l
       Pacífico. (Fernández de Miranda, Swadesh, and Weitlaner
       1960:141)Unfortunately, Swadesh and his associates did not present the
evidence upon which their proposal was based, but, as we shall see
presently, the facts do no support such a classification.
   Juan Hasler in s e v e r a l publications (1958a, 1958b, 1961, 1975,
1976, 1977) invoked a q u a t r i p a r t i t e view of Nahua d i a l e c t o l o g y ,
with his Eastern branch containing both "" P i p i l "" (which f o r hira
includes Central American P i p i l and v a r i e t i e s from southern

because branching charts cannot be used to show the complex r e l a -
tionships which usually exist among dialects"" (Canger 1980:16). In
c l a r i f y i n g her Central vs. Peripheral division, which she considers
""fundamental"", Canger i n d i c a t e s that i t i s ""founded b a s i c a l l y on
one i s o g l o s s : the presence versus the absence of the stem f i n a l
vowel in the perfect of verbs"" (Canger 1983:30). However, she does
not believe this division to be old, no more that 500 years (Canger
1983:31). That i s , the defining f e a t u r e s of central d i a l e c t s are
not ""due to common inheritance, but rather to late influence from
one p r e s t i g i o u s and dominating d i a l e c t ; and they have had the
function precisely of unifying the dialects"" (Canger 1983:32).                                       In
short, ""peripheral dialects were defined negatively simply by not
having the features diagnostic f o r the Central d i a l e c t s "" (Canger
1983:28).
      I w i l l examine the t r a i t s which Canger (and others before her)
have presented as support f o r placing P i p i l within her Eastern
group (part of the l a r g e r Peripheral group). While she did not
intend her c l a s s i f i c a t i o n to be understood as g e n e t i c , I w i l l
discuss the implications of her dialect t r a i t s for a genetic clas-
s i f i c a t i o n of P i p i l , showing the complications f o r any proposed
                                                                                                      927c l o s e r c l a s s i f i c a t i o n of P i p i l with Mexican v a r i e t i e s of Nahua.

   mu-chi:l         mu-chi:l     ""your chili pepper""
   i-chi:l          i-chi :1     ""his/her chili pepper""
   tu-chi:1         tu-chi:1     ""our chili pepper""
   anmu-chi:1       amu-chi:1    ""your (pi.) chili pepper'
   in-chi:1         in-chi:1     ""their chili pepper""   When a noun bears one of these possessive prefixes, it does not
carry the absolutive suffix, as noted above, but in certain circum-
stances it takes a possessive suffix. That is, noun roots w h i c h
end in -a, -e, or -i. generally take the suffix -w; those which have
root-final -ji or a consonant do not have it. This is illustrated
in the following examples; the hyphen (-) indicates that the noun
bears s o m e prefix, in this case one of the possessive pronominal
prefixes which co-occur with the possessive suffix -w:    -a:ka-w         reed
    -a:ka-peta-w    figured mat
    -a:ma-w         amate (fig tree sp.)
    -a:-w           water
    -a :waka-w      avocado
    -chan-ta:ka-w   person from one's own town
    -chi:la-w       chilate (a corn drink)
    -chukula-w      chocolate
    -e:-w           bean
    -icha-w         cotton
    -ilwi-w         fiesta (ceremomy)
    -ista-w         salt
    -i:x-saka-w     rice
    -kili-w         chipilin (plant)
    -kune:-w        child
    -malaka-w       spindle
    -masa:-w        deer
    -maxta-w        breechclout, loincloth
    -meka-w         string, cord, rope
    -naka-w         meat
    -sa:wa-w        pimple, boil
    -siwa:-w        wife, woman
    -suki-w         clay
    -ta:ka-w        husband, man
    -teki-w         work
44     -te:ntsi:ka-w    chin
     -te-w            stone, rock
     -ti:-w           fire
     -tuma-w          tomato
     -uhta-w          cane sp.
     -u:ml-w          bone
     -xu:chi-w        flower   It is to be recalled that some noun roots lose their final vowel
when they take a possessive prefix. Possessed they no longer bear
the absolutive suffix, which, if present would keep the vowel from
occurring in final position. A few examples are:     -atin           louse            cf. atime-t
     -chikiw         basket           cf. chikiwi-t
     -kakaw          cacao            cf. kakawa-t
     -kax            bowl             cf. kaxi-t
     -ku:n           jug, pot         cf. ku:mi-t
     -kuyan          Pig              cf. kuyame-t
     -kwaw           tree, wood       cf. kwawi-t
     -met            metate (quern)   cf. meta-t
     -pet            mat              cf. peta-t
     -tekun          bottle gourd     cf. tekuma-t   Some other examples which lack -w are the following with either
a final u or consonant:     -a:chiyu        bixa (achiote)
     -cha:luku       guava
     -e:lu           roasting ear
     -exu            green beans, string beans
     -ulu            corncob
     -xi:lu          ear of green corn
     -xu:chu (SD)    flower
     -xuku           hogplum (jocote)
     -a:xi:x         urine
     -ich            string, fiber
     -kak            sandal
     -kamuh          cassava, sweet potato
     -nek            sweet(s), candy
     -pah            medicine
     -sah            wax
     -sin            maize
     -teksis         egg
     -tenex          lime(stone)
                                                                 45
   -tix            corn dough
   -ta:l           land, earth
   -tamal          tortilla
   -chi:1          chili pepper
   -kal            house
   -ma:pipil       fingers
   -lala           orange (Spanish loanword)   There is also another possessive suffix, -yu. w h i c h m e a n s
'intimate (sometimes called 'inalienable') possession'. Forms with
this suffix are inherently more closely connected to, or ""intimate""
with the possessor, often an inalienable part thereof. It is best
understood by seeing it in contrast with the      possessive suffix
which suggests no particularly close association between the noun
and its possessor. Compare, then, for example, nu-naka-w ""my meat""
(to eat, but not part of my body) with nu-naka-yu ""my flesh"" (i.e.
meat that is part of my body); i-u:mi-w ""his bone"" (for chewing,
not part of his body) with i-u:mi-yu ""his bone"" (in his body).
Some examples of 'intimate possession' with the -yu suffix are:    -a:-yu            juice, liquid (from ""water"")
    -bainah-yu        pod, sheath, scabbard
    -es-yu            blood
    -e:wa-yu          skin
    -ikx-u:mi-yu     shin bone
    -iswa-yu          leaf
    -i:x-kal(i)-yu   eyebrow
    -i:x-tsuhtsun-yu eyelash
    -i:x-tsukul-yu   knot
    -kahah-yu        coffin (from Spanish ca.ja ""box"")
    -kakax-yu        animal skeleton
    -kodoh-yu        elbow
    -ko :lah-yu       tail
    -kwe:n-yu         blanket
    -kwerdah-yu       cord
    -ma:mis-yu        elbow
    -mante:ka-yu      lard, grease
    -naka-yu          flesh
    -nelwa-yu         root
    -nex-yu ti-t      fire's ash(es)
    -paletah-yu       hip
    -plantiyah-yu     sole of foot
    -rayis-yu         root
    -se :bu-yu        tallow, grease
    -se :rah-yu       wax
46      -sombrah-yu              shadow (of someone)
      -takon-yu                heel
      -te:ku-yu                owner
      -tripah-yu               intestines
      -tsin-bankuh-yu          tailbone
      -uhmi-yu                 featherThe forms showing intimate possession with -yu generally are body
parts, plant parts, parts of animals, or other things c l o s e l y
associated with the possessor. I t is worth noting that so-called
""inalienable"" possession i s a f e a t u r e common to a l l Mesoamerican
Indian languages, as w e l l as many others outside t h i s l i n g u i s t i c
area. The label ""inalienable"" i s generally employed in reference
to a class of nouns which typically do not occur without possessive
a f f i x e s . These nouns c h a r a c t e r i s t i c a l l y belong to the semantic
classes of body parts (hence the name "" i n a l i e n a b l e "" ) and kinship
terms ( i n t i m a t e l y associated with the possessor, but not so
inalienable). P i p i l , of course, conforms to this pattern.","[56, 57, 58, 59, 60]"

""instrumental prefixes"", but much less extensively than some other
Uto-Aztecan languages. The instrumental prefix is basically an
incorporated noun, usually a body-part term, w h i c h semantically
signals the instrument by which the action of the verb is realized.
These have been called instrumental prefixes because in some lan-
guages the incorporated elements appear in a changed, abbreviated
form s o m e w h a t different from the full nouns from w h i c h they are
derived. (Pipil also has such changed forms, but with incorporated
objects, rather than these instrumental f o r m s (see below).) The
few examples appear to be frozen; they are:     1) tan-kwa             to bite (tan- ""tooth"", kwa ""to eat"")
     2) mu-tankwa-ketsa     to kneel (tankwa ('knee'), ketsa
                              ""to stand"")
     3) ikxi-ahsi           to reach, catch up with (ikxi
                              ""foot"", ahsi to ""arrive, find"")
     4) kwa:ch-ki:xtia      to strain, sift (kwa:ch- ""cloth"",
                              ki:xtia ""to take out"")
     5) te-tsikwini         to cross the river on rocks (te-
                              ""rock"", tsikwini ""to jump"")
     6) mu-tu:nal-tatia     to sun (tu:nal ""sun"", tatia ""to burn"")
                                                                 97   3.7.10.3. Object incorporation. Like other Uto-Aztecan and many
native American languages, Nahua varieties can incorporate an ob-
ject noun directly into the verb. Such incorporated objects have a
generic or non-specific sense. English does not really have this
kind of incorporation, but examples such as ¿o proofread (read
proof), to babysit (sit babies), to deerhunt(?) (hunt deer), and to
barhop (hop bars) give a good idea of the construction. In Pipil
it is no longer productive and most of the forms are frozen; for
that reason, some examples were included in the section on verb
compounds (cf. 4.6.2). The most common are the cases with a body-
part term incorporated. Cases in which the incorporated element
occurs in a special form different from its independent nominal
counterpart are signaled by single quotes ('...') which otherwise
are employed to mark grammatical elements as opposed to lexical
material (marked with double quotes (""..."")).
  Some examples with regular incorporated nouns are:   a:raa-ita              to read (a:ma- ""book"", ita ""tosee"")
   ich-ma:linl (SD)     to twist string (ich ""string"", ma:lini

   kalaki               to enter (kal ""house"", (aki) ""enter"")

   mu-kal-tapa:na
                          ""house"", taparna ""to break open"")

"Some indications of how this rule works are the following.
      a) The root—final vowel i s maintained a f t e r a consonant cluster:
- a h s i - k ""(he) a r r i v e d "" , -chihcha-k ""(he) spat"", - i x k a - k ""(he)
roasted ( i t ) "" , uksi-k ""cooked"", etc.
      b) The root-final vowel i s maintained when the verbal root ends
in -ka: -chu:ka-k ""(he) cried"", -maka-k ""(he) gave"", -tu:ka-k
"" ( h e ) planted"", -wika-k ""(he) carried ( i t ) "" , e t c .
      c) The f i n a l vowel of the verb root i s preserved because i t ends

    (1.2) Vowel loss in nouns. A rule very s i m i l a r to the vowel-
loss rule in verbs also applies to nouns, except that the f i n a l -u
of nouns may also be dropped and the loss of a of noun roots ending
in -ka i s v a r i a b l e with respect to loss. This i s indeed a phono-
logically conditioned rule, though i t s application i s most easily
perceived in certain grammatical contexts, for example in nominal
forms bearing a possessive prefix where the absolutive s u f f i x i s
not present so that the end of the noun root i s bare (see section
3.1.1.), leaving r o o t - f i n a l vowels in w o r d - f i n a l p o s i t i o n . Its

   It should be noted that certain kinds of relative clauses do not
exist in Pipil that are possible in English, such as those of the
form, for example, ""this is the girl whose father I know"" and ""this
is the man for whom I work"". Relativization of possessors such as
English ""the man's house who ... "" are also not found in Pipil,
since the construction is of the form ""his-house the man who"", more
similar to English ""the house of the man who"" (see example 3 of
A.14.1).","[143, 144]"

3.2.3, pronominal object prefixes function most often to indicate
direct objects, but signal indirect objects as well. In either
case, the verb may bear only one object prefix. In the case of
indirect pronominal objects, there is often an independent noun
phrase direct object or clear contextual clues as to the pronoun's
role with respect to the verb. It may be that the indirect object
function of these pronominal affixes has been influenced by
Spanish, which like English has the same pronominal forms for both
indirect and direct objects in many cases, e.g. mje pegó ""he hit
me"", me di6 el libro ""he gave me the book"". In cases where both
the direct and indirect object are pronominal, it is usually the
indirect object that is marked on the verb, with the direct object
signaled as a full independent pronoun (cf. 3.5.2). One possible
interpretation of this is that animate cases are given priority,
since usually the indirect objects are animate.   Some examples of
pronominal prefixes as markers of indirect objects are:
110      1) nech-ahkaw-ilih-ke-t tumin.
      me-leave-APPLIC-PRET-PL money.
      ""They left me (the) money.""      2) ni-yu ni-mitsin-raaka se: pwestoh. (R-54)
      I-go I-you pi.-give a position.
      ""I am going to give you (pl.) a position.""      3) nech-ilwia.
      me-tell.
      ""(She) tells me.""      4) kin-maka-k      pwestoh  ne    prinsipeh    ne    seryuk

      ""She no longer gives her grandchildren the food.""      6) ki-raaka-ke-t ti:-t ne kal. (N-139)

      ""(To) me myself the old m a n has told me (it)."" = ""The old
      man has told (it to) me myself.""","[123, 124]"
"     3.2.5. Indefinite pronouns.            The indefinite pronouns are:     ahakah (SD)             someone, somebody
     kanah                   elsewhere, somewhere
                               (with negative ""nowhere"")
     ka:kah                  someone
     su a:kah                no one, nobody
     tesu katka              nothing
     su kanah                nowhere, there is/are not
     su datka (C)            nothing
     te: datka (SD)          nothing
3.3. Articles and demonstratives   3.3.1. Articles. The Pipil definite and indefinite articles
correspond roughly in meaning and function to those of Spanish,
although they act a bit more like demonstratives. That is, these
                                                                 57articles are slightly less obligatory than those of Spanish or
English, and when they are used, they have slightly more demonstra-
tive force. Thus ne ta:ka-t might be translated equally well as
""the man"" or ""that man"" on many occasions. These are:    ne              the
    se:             a/an (a certain)In normal speech ne is frequently pronounced ili and se: is se
without vowel length.","[70, 71]"
"   Vowel loss in the 'third person singular object' prefix ki-, on
the other hand, is more general, and quite similar to that of
Classical Nahuatl. Basically the i is lost when it is preceded by
another vowel, that is, when preceded by another prefix which
ends in a vowel, e.g. ni-k-chiwa ""I do it"" (from ni-ki-chiwa).
The ¿ is alos lost when followed by another vowel, which generally
turns out to be the initial vowel of verb roots, e.g., k-uni
""(she) drinks it"" (from ki-uni), k-i:xtu:ka ""(he) inserts it""
(from ki-i:xtu:ka), k-uli:nia ""(he) stirs it"" (from ki-uli:nia),
etc. Nevertheless, there are exceptions to this; the _1 is not lost
before -ah or -el, derivational elements (see section 3.3.6) when
ki- is not preceded by another prefix, e.g. ki-ah-wa ""(she) scolds
him"", ki-el-kawa ""(he) forgets it"", ki-ah-ka:na ""(he) fans it"",
ki-ah-kawa ""(he) leaves it"" (cf. ni-k-ah-kawa ""I leave it"").
   Generally the vowel of the 'reflexive' prefix mu- is kept, with
a few exceptions. Some examples of these exceptions are:
32     m-ihtutia ""to dance"" (cf. k-ihtutia ""to dance it"")
     m-ihkwani ""to remove oneself"" (cf. k-ihkwani ""to
        remove it"")
     m-i:naya ""to hide (oneself)"" (cf. k-i:naya ""to
        hide it""
     m-itu:niya ""to sweat""
     m-a:ltia ""to bathe (oneself)"" (cf. k-a;ltia ""to bathe
        him/her"")
     m-a:wiltia ""to play"" (cf. k-a:wiltia ""to play it"")These exceptional forms can be compared with the more general
cases, such as:      mu-i:xmu:tia ""to be frightened"" (cf. k-i:xmu:tia ""to   frighten
        him/her it"")
     mu-i:xtu;ka ""to insert, put in""
     mu-i:xyu;lkwi ""to revive, come to""
     mu-uli:nia ""to be stirred""
     mu-ahkape:wia ""to fan flies away from oneself""
     mu-ahsuma ""to comb oneself""
     mu-e(t)s-tuk ""to be seated""
     mu-a:paka ""to wash oneself""
     mu-ihchiki ""to scrub oneself""
     mu-a:te:kia ""to wet, sprinkle oneself""
     mu-ikxichalua ""to stumble, trip""
     (See section 3.3.4.3.)   Finally, the morpheme -ta- ""something"" ('unspecified object')
loses its vowel (a) before another a^, e.g. t-ahwilia ""to wet
something"" (from ta-ahwilia). In Santo Domingo de Guzmán this a
is lost frequently before other vowels, as well, e.g. t-uchpa:na
""to sweep"", from ta-uchpa:na. compare       Cuisnahuat ta-chpa:na),
t-iskalia ""to raise, grow"" (cf. Cuisnahuat ta-iskalia (see
section 3.3.4.4.)).
   (2) Vowel prothesls. Pipil, like other varieties of Nahua, has
some underlying forms which begin with two consonants, but such
roots show the initial consonant cluster only when they are
preceded by a prefix ending in a vowel. Otherwise, when these
roots occur without a prefix, a prothetic ^ (often called epenthe-
tic in Nahua literature) always comes before the consonants. In
examples presented in this book, the epenthetic i_ is presented in
parentheses, i.e. (¿), and such forms are found listed in the
dictionary under the letter i. Some examples which show both the
presence and absence of this epenthetic jl are:

had a fever. (14) I could barely cure him; I knew the cure.

      Vowel length i s an important c o n t r a s t , but i t i s d i f f i c u l t to
determine in many cases. There are such minimal pairs as pa;ta ""to
melt"" / pata ""to change""; ne: "" t h e r e "" / ne ' d e f i n i t e a r t i c l e ' ; the
roots m e : t s - ""moon"" / mets- "" t h i g h "" ; e t c . , but such p a i r s are not
f r e q u e n t . The d i f f i c u l t y i s t h a t , due to P i p i l ' s moribund s t a t e ,
many speakers no longer make the vowel-length contrast, or they do
i t only in more f o r m a l c o n t e x t s . Among my main c o n s u l t a n t s in
Cuisnahuat, one lacked the contrast altogether, another had i t only
in formal contexts (for example when c a r e f u l l y comparing l i n g u i s t i c
forms, reciting word l i s t s , etc.), and a third used i t consistently
throughout his speech. In Santo Domingo de Guzmán my consultants
generally lacked the contrast in everyday speech, but were able to
produce the d i s t i n c t i o n s when queried about i n d i v i d u a l words.
Nevertheless, only two individuals there maintained the distinction
consistently in a way r e l a t i v e l y easy to perceive.
       In both dialects the léngth contrast i s clear only in stressed
s y l l a b l e s , i.e. the penultimate, in most forms. Notwithstanding,
in many cases d i f f e r e n t s y l l a b l e s may be stressed in derivations
with v a r i e d p r e f i x e s or s u f f i x e s , e.g. / m a s a : - t / ( m á s a t ) "" d e e r "" .
/ m a s a : - t s i n / ( m a s á r t s i g ) "" l i t t l e deer""; / t e : l p u : c h / ( t é : l p u c h )
""son"", / t e : l p u : c h - t s i n / ( t e l p ú r c h t s i g ) "" l i t t l e son""; /tekuma-t/
(tekúmat) ""bottle gourd"", /nu-tekun/ (nutékug) ""my b o t t l e gourd"",
/ t e k u m a - t s i n / (tekumátsirj) "" l i t t l e bottle gourd"" (""tecomatillo"");
etc. (These examples are cited from Cuisnahuat dialect).
      In Cuisnahuat a l l w o r d - i n i t i a l vowels a r e p h o n e t i c a l l y long,
although those followed by a single consonant are longer than those
f o l l o w e d by two, e.g. / i : s a / ( i : s a ) ""to wake up"", / u l u - t / ( u : l u t )
""corncob"", / i s t a - t / ( i ' s t a t ) "" s a l t "" . Underlying vowel length can
be determined in such forms by f i n d i n g the form with some p r e f i x
which removes the vowel from word-initial position, e.g. /uh-ulu-t/
(uhúlut) ""corncobs"", /nu-ulu/ (nu(w)úlu) ""my corncob"",                                   /n-i:sa-k/
( n i : s a k ) "" I woke up"". Santo Domingo de Guzmán has undergone c e r -
t a i n changes with r e s p e c t to vowel length in t r i s y l l a b i c words,
p a r t i c u l a r l y verbs. With V to r e p r e s e n t a s y l l a b l e , forms with
V..tf:..V have changed to                                in many c a s e s .
26     In the f i n a l a n a l y s i s , although I did a l l I could to determine
underlying vowel length a c c u r a t e l y f o r each of the forms of the
d i c t i o n a r y , many c a s e s remain in which vowel length i s simply
uncertain. The marking of length i s much more secure in stressed
syllables and in frequently occurring words.","[38, 39, 40]"
"     3.7.8.4. 'Passives' (-1_, - l u , - l w - , and -ua). Although these
passive suffixes are no longer productive, Pipil has many passive
verbs of this kind derived from actives. The most common type has
-lu. From this comes the             suffix which derives nouns from pas-
sive verbs (e.g. ta-kwa-1 ""food"", ta- 'something' + k w a ""to eat"" +
— ' p a s s i v e nominalization'; literally ""something that is eaten"";
cf. section 3.1.3.10). The - u a class of passive verbs is smaller.
W i t h this suffix, preceding ¿ and Jts are palatalized to x_ and £ h
respectively (cf. section 2.2). Verbs derived from others with
these suffixes have meanings that are either passive or intransi-
tive reflexive. Some examples are:    ahkamacha:lua      to yawn (cf. kamachal ""jaw"")
    (i)hkwilua        to write
90     i :xpanua        to place before (cf. i:xpan ""before"")
     i :xtapachua     to turn over (cf. tapach ""shell"")
     kimilua          to wrap (cf. kimil ""bundle"")
     kwah-kwalu       to be exhausted (cf. kwa ""to eat"")
     kwalu            to be insect-infested (cf. kwa ""to eat"")
     kwalu me:ts-ti   for the moon to eclipse (cf. kwalu)
     pahsulua         for hair to be mussed (cf. pahsul ""nest"")
     pitsakua         to make thinner (cf. pitsa(:wa)k ""thin""
     pixua            to lay eggs (cf. piya ""to have"" (?))
     sa:lúa           to stick, glue (cf. sasa:lik ""sticky"")
     taswilua         to light 9cf. ta:wil ""light"")
     taxkalua         to make tortillas (cf. taxkal ""rigua"")
     tsapalua         to get down (cf. tsapa-tsin ""short"")
     tsitsinua        to break into pieces (cf. tsin ""base""?)
     mu-tsukulua      to squat (cf. tsukul ""lump"")
     ululua           to roll (cf. ulul-nah ""round"")   3.7.8.5. 'Applicatives' (-lia (and -iltia)). In Nahua studies,
'applicative' is the traditional name for the suffix w h i c h indi-
cates that the verb permits three arguments, subject, direct o b -
ject, and indirect object, with the meaning ""someone (subject) does
(verb) something (direct object) for or against someone (indirect
object, 'applicative' suffix). The basic form of the 'applicative'
suffix is -lia, but like the passive, this, too, historically
contained an i. which sometimes causes the root vowel to change to i
and palatalizes /s/ and /ts/ to /x/ and /ch/, respectively. S o m e
examples are:     kuwilia         to buy for (kuwa ""to buy"")
     kwepilia         to return something to someone (kwepa
                        ""to return"")
     pahpa:kilia      to laugh at (pa:ki ""to laugh"")
     tapatilia        to change something for someone (pati
                        ""to change"")
     petstilia        to undress someone (mu-petstia ""to undress"")
     takwi:kalia      to sing for (takwi:ka ""to sing"")
     mu-tate:muwilia to look for something for someone
                        te:mua ""to look for"")
     tepe:wilia       to pile on for (tepe:wa ""to pile"")
     tetilia          to tie tight on (tete-k ""tight"")
                                                                  91
   tsahtsalia      to shout to, to call someone something
                      (tsahtsi ""to shout"")
   wi:kilia        to owe someone something (wi:ka ""to take"")A variant form of the 'applicative', -ltia. occurs with a few
verbs; -lwia in one case:   takwiltia      to loan someone something (takwi ""to borrow"")
   tane:wiltia     to lend (tane:wi ""to borrow"")
   takwi:kalwia    to sing something for someone (takwi:ka
                     ""to sing"")   3.7.8.6. 'Diffusion* verbs (-ni/-na/-nia). The verbs with the
suffixes -ni (intransitive) and -nia/-na (transitive) have a common
semantic trait, although it is difficult to specify that feature
clearly. Many of these verbs refer to sounds, others to breaking
or tearing, and still others to the extension or diffusion of
something. Perhaps it is not wholly felicitous to call these all
'diffusion' verbs, but if w e stretch the notion of diffusion is
stretched to include sounds (which, of course, do diffuse), and if
then breaking and tearing are further placed among the verbs of
sound (given that sound is produced in such actions), perhaps we
can speak of 'diffusion' verbs without misinterpretation. Examples
of these are:  ahka:na          to blow, fan pusu: ni         to foam
  chahchakwa:ni    to mash       sulu:ni         to swell
  chichina         to smoke      takipi: ni      to lightening
  chipi:ni         to drip       tapa:ni (i.v.) to explode
  ihkwani,         to remove     tapa:na (t.v.) to explode
  kahkani          to blow       tatsi:ni        to sprinkle
  kawa: ni         to shine      ta:wa:na (t.v.) to get drunk
  kaxa:ni (i.v.)   to loosen     tikwi(:)ni      to thunder
  kaxa:nia (t.v.) to loosen      tila:na         to pull
  ke:luna          to break      tili:nia        to stretch
  ku:mu:ni (i.v.) to swarm       tsala:ni        to thunder
  ku:mu:nia (t.v.) to excite     tsaya:na        to split
  kupi:nl          to come off   tsikwi:ni       to jump
  kupi:na          to tear off   tsilini         to ring
  kutu:na          to cut        tsupina         to sting, stick
  kuwa:na          to shrink     tsutsu:na       to play music
  kuyuna (t.v.)    to make hole tsuyu:ni         to fry
  kuyuni (i.v.)    for a hole to uchpa:na        to sweep
                     form
  kwala: ni        to get angry uli:ni (i.v.)    to stir, move
92     pala:ni           to rot         uli:nia (t.v.)   to stir, move
     pata:ni           to fly
     paya: na          to grind corn wawa:na           to scrape
                         (first pass)
     pehpena           to pick up
     (peh)petu:ni      to slip, slide
     pipina            to suck
     pitsinia          to tighten
     puchi: na         to unsew
   3.7.8.7.  'Repetitives' of 'diffusion' verbs (-ka 'intransi-
tive', -tsa 'transitive').     Related to the 'diffusion' verbs
(ending in -ni, -na, -nia) are the 'repetitive' verbs. These end in
-ka when intransitive, in -tsa for transitives. Some examples with
comparisons are:
     tsili:ni             ihtsilika             ihtsilitsa
      ""to ring""            ""to tremble""          ""to shake, ring""

      ""to get angry""      ""to boil""              ""to boil""

6.0.   Introduction   This chapter is a Spanish-Pipil dictionary, which also contains
English glosses.    The decision to present it in Spanish rather
than English is based primarily on the fact that many entries have
very clear and distinct meanings in Spanish, for w h i c h only
imprecise English glosses are available, or only wordy paraphrases.
It does not contain full information for each entry, but rather is
intended as something of a ready index to the full entries
contained in chapter 5 (the Pipil-Spanish-English dictionary). The

"   Some examples of this rule's application, in which nouns with
the absolutive suffix compared with other forms, are:      atimi-t,
nu-atin ""my louse""; chikiwi-t. nu-chikiw ""my basket""; kakawa-t.
nu-kakaw ""my cacao""; kaxi-t, nu-kax ""my bowl""; kuyame-t. nu-kuyan
""my pig""; kwita-t, nu-kwit ""my excrement""; peta-t, nu-pet ""my
mat""; tekuma-t, nu-tekun ""my bottle gourd""; ikx-u:miyu ""shin"" (from
ikxi- ""foot"" + u:mi-yu ""bone""); ku:n-ti:l ""soot"" (from ku:mi-
""pot"" + ti:l   ""soot (black))""; kuyan=iswa-t ""cuyanigua (a wild
root like a sweet potato)"" (from kuyame- ""pig"" + iswa-t ""leaf"");
etc.
   (1.3) Vowel loss in suffixes. This same rule applies to suf-
fixes, as well. For example, the absolutive suffix has two main
allomorphs, -ti with nouns that end in a consonant, and        with
those which terminate in a vowel (see secation 3.1.1). With -ti as
the underlying (basic) form of this suffix, the - ¿ i s lost if no
consonant clusters result.     For example, underlying /a:ka-ti/
""reed"" becomes a:ka-t (recall that the root-final -a is not lost
when it is protected by the lc (see above)), while in /es-ti/
""blood"" the    of the absolutive -ti is maintained since that its
loss would otherwise result in a final consonant cluster and also
in a monosyllabic form. Some examples both with -C-ti and with -V-t
are:   kak-ti ""sandal"", pah-ti ""medicine"", tix-ti ""corn dough"",
sin-ti ""maize"", me:ts-ti ""moon""; a:waka-t ""avocado"", a:chiyu-t
""bixa (achiote)"", a:-t ""water"", e:-t ""bean"", e:lu-t ""roasting ear
(ear of corn)"", ku:ska-t ""necklace"", kwawi-t ""tree""; etc.
   Similarly, the 'preterite (past tense)' suffix has two allo-
morphs, -ki after consonants and -lc after vowels. (It also has the
variant   in some cases, but that is not relevant to this rule (see
section 3.3.2.).) With /-ki/ as the underlying (basic) form, the
vowel-loss rule eliminates the      if no consonant clusters arise.
For example, compare -maka-k ""(he) gave (it)"", where the -a of the
verb root is protected from loss by the lc and where the final -i of
the suffix is lost, with -chiw-ki ""(he) did (it)"", where the-root
final vowel was lost which created a consonant cluster which in
turn prevented the final vowel of the 'preterite' suffix from loss
(for more examples, see section 3.3.2.).
                                                                 31
   (1.4) Vowel loss in prefixes. Pipil generally keeps its prefix-
final vowels in contrast to Classical Nahuatl and most other Nahua
varieties which tend to lose a prefix vowel when it appears before
another vowel. Notwithstanding, in certain limited contexts Pipil
also loses this vowel. Unlike these other varieties of Nahua,
Pipil does not lose the vowel of possessive prefixes or of subject
pronominal prefixes on verbs, except before the verbal directional
morpheme (w)al- or before i. Some examples are:   n-i:xwi ""I'm filling up/getting full"" (from ni-i:xwi)
   x-ihisiwi ""hurry up!"" (from xi-ihisiwi)
   t-ihkiti ""you weave"" (from ti-ihkiti)and:   x-al-ahsi ""find it!"" (cf. xi-ahsi ""arrive!"")
   t-al-ahsi-k ""you found it"" (cf. ti-ahsi-k ""you arrived"")
   n-al-ahsi-k ""I found it"" (cf. ni-ahsi-k ""I arrived"")
   t-al-ahsi-ke-t ""we found it""(cf. ti-ahsi-ke-t ""we arrived"").","[44, 45]"
"However, w i t h r e s p e c t t o P i p i l , t h i s c r i t e r i o n f a i l s , or b e t t e r

a n a l o g i c a l changes based on p r e s e n t - t e n s e f o r m s (which a l w a y s
contain the vowel). For example forms such                                       as      ni-k-pix-ki
928""I had it"" ni-k-chix-ki ""I saw it"", ti-k-ihix-ki ""you hated it"",
and ni-k-u:x ""I shelled      it"" (from -piy-a, -chiy-a, -ihiy-a,
and -u:y-a, respectively) show vowel loss to be old, given that the
morphophonemic change of final and preconsonantal χ to j: is ancient
(from Proto-Nahua times, cf. Campbell and Langacker 1978) and is no
longer productive (cf. section 2.2). The explanation of a variant
form such as ni-k-piya-k (SD) ""I had it"" instead of the more
usual and older ni-k-pix-ki (C) is that the former is of recent
analogical formation (occurring with much less frequency than the
original forms without the stem-final vowel, probably based on the
class of verbs which in pipil and almost all other varieties of
Nahua does not lose the stem-final vowel in the preterite (cf.
section 2.2., 3.7.3) and by the vowel's presence in the 'present'-
tense forms. Actually, the class of verbs which loses the stem-
final vowel in Pipil is by far the most ample, with approximately
twice the number of members as the classes which retain the vowel.
   Consequently, given that vowel loss is very old, Pipil cannot
convincingly be considered closely connected with Canger's Eastern
group (part of the larger Peripheral grouping) on the basis of this
criterion alone. This conclusion is seen with clarity when Pipil
verbs are compared with forms from Mecayapan, Veracruz (often
called ""Isthmus"" Nahua, part of Canger's Eastern dialect group),
which is incidentally the dialect many have considered most closely
related to Central American Pipil. Compare the third person singu-
lar preterite forms; note that final -Jc has become    in Mecayapan
(examples from Canger 1980:71):
      Mecayapan             Pipil
      kochi-7               kuch-ki        slept

s t a t e very much l i k e that found in C l a s s i c a l Nahuatl; i . e . , in
general P i p i l has undergone vowel loss in the preterite (-C-ki) in
the verb c l a s s e s which permit i t and in t h i s r e s p e c t P i p i l i s
d i s t i n c t from the Eastern d i a l e c t s (of the P e r i p h e r a l group)
which do not permit t h i s vowel loss.
      A sober assessment of t h i s f a c t leaves P i p i l d i s t i n c t , but,
unfortunately, does not demonstrate that there could not have been
a closer connection between these two varieties. I f they had been
c l o s e l y r e l a t e d , Isthmus Nahua could s t i l l have undergone the
analogical restoration of the stem-final vowel ( i f that i s indeed
what happened) a f t e r P i p i l had separated. That i s , to show t h a t
the two belong together one must demonstrate shared innovations.
Since vowel loss in the 'preterite' i s apparently not shared (which
i s Canger's principal c l a s s i f i c a t o r y t r a i t ) , i f a connection i s to
be d e m o n s t r a t e d i t w i l l have t o be based on o t h e r shared
innovations. I t i s to Canger's other shared t r a i t s that I now
turn.
     The other f e a t u r e s which Canger presented f o r her Eastern
dialects do not serve to prove that Pipil belongs genetically to
the group, e i t h e r . I t should be r e c a l l e d t h a t she did not intend
them to have a genetic interpretation, but i f P i p i l i s to be placed
h i s t o r i c a l l y , their weight for genetic c l a s s i f i c a t i o n needs to be
assessed.
     F i r s t , P i p i l and Isthmus Nahua share the p l u r a l morpheme of
independent personal pronouns, - m e - t ( P i p i l ) / -me-h (Isthmus),
while others tend to have - t i n or -n. Nevertheless, the suffix
-me-h i s found in various other, non-Eastern dialects, such as La
Huasteca, which i s considered Central (Canger 1978:13, Hasler
1961:459). For example, Guerrero d i a l e c t s ( X a l i t l a , C o p a l i l l o ,
Z i t a l a , Acatlan, and X a l a t z a l a ) have tahwameh ""we"" (Canger
1980:96). Thus, the following forms exist for ""we"":

"      3.1.1. Absolutives. In P i p i l a s u f f i x c a l l e d the ' a b s o l u t i v e '
occurs with most noun roots when these appear without other a f -
fixes. Thus, for example, the 'absolutive' occurs with otherwise
bare nouns, as in s i w a ; - t ""woman"", where -_t i s the ' a b s o l u t i v e '
s u f f i x , but not with the noun root when i t occurs in composition
with          another element, e.g. nu-siwa:w         ""my        wife"", siwa:-pil
"" g i r l "" , siwa:-pah ""ciguapate (a medicinal plant, l i t e r a l l y 'woman-

than 1. This allomorph occurs mostly with monosyllabic noun roots,
but some polysyllabic ones also take it. A few examples are:     es-ti      blood                   sah-ti    wax

occurs principally with terms for small animals and a few other
nouns, hence it is occasionally called the ""varmint"" class. This
allomorph, however, is not lost when the noun occurs with a
prefix, e.g. nu-mich-in ""my fish"", but it is absent from compounds:     chapulin ""grasshopper""        chapul-ehtapal ""chapulaltapa""

archaic variant of the - i n a l l o m o r p h in the form of - a n after k-,

including all that end inji, c) with Spanish loans, regardless of
whether they end in a consonant or a vowel, and d) with nouns

     sala       pants, trousers   With a few roots the a b s o l u t i v e s u f f i x i s not dropped when
possessive pronominal prefixes are present. These examples are:      -a:pan-ti            irrigated f i e l d
      -a:wa-t              bud
      -chankwita-t         corn candy

      -tuch-ti             rabbit
      -i(t)sti-t           (finger)nailThese are a l l exceptional in not dropping the a b s o l u t i v e under
possession. In some cases i t may be assumed that the old absolu-
t i v e has become frozen a s part of the r o o t , e.g. - a : p a n t i ; o t h e r s
may be influenced by the f a c t that local Spanish has borrowed the
Pipil form with some indication of the absolutive in the borrowed
form, which in turn may have come to i n f l u e n c e the native P i p i l
form to maintain a root more similar to the Spanish version, e.g.
-awa-t i s in Spanish ""aguate"", -kal-tsun-ti i s ""caisonte"".
      There are also two exceptions with - t i a f t e r a root-final -JL:
(SD) a h s i : l - t i  ""nit  (louse         egg)""    (but   (C) a h s i : l )  and
a : w i l - t i ""toy"" (in both d i a l e c t s ) . However, in the l a t t e r word,
the - t i i s not dropped when i t occurs with p o s s e s s i v e pronominal
prefixes, and for that reason i t i s perhaps better to consider the
- t i to be frozen as part of the root i t s e l f .","[53, 54, 55, 56]"

4.5. Imperatives    In the morphology it was seen that the second person imperative

the negative imperative construction are considered.",[129]
"   4.18. Complex verb phrases. Pipil has other constructions in
which two (or more) verbs occur together within the same (surface-
structure) verb phrase in constructions which would correspond to
infinitival forms in English or Spanish (i.e. sentences which have
undergone Equivalent Noun-Phrase Deletion, see below). Within this
more general class of juxtaposed verb forms, three verbs (wiîts ""to
come"", ki:sa ""to leave"", and -neki ""to want"") have a function
intermediate between full, main verbs and auxiliaries. They a r e
best apprehended from examples.

(See section 3.6.3.)   3.7.8.3.2. 'Inchoatives' of ""perception"" or ""sensation"" (-va).
Another kind of inchoative verb bears the suffix -ya. which derives
intransitive inchoatives from adjective roots which typically mean
something having to do with ""sensations"" or ""perceptions"". Some
examples are:     chichi:ltiya    to redden (chi:l-tik ""red"")
     chichiya        to become bitter (chichi-k ""bitter"")

    ye:ktiya          to improve, get fixed (ye:k ""good"")   3.7.8.3.3. -ti ""to become"". The final kind of inchoative takes
the suffix -ti which is not productive, but which derives inchoa-
tive verbs from some noun roots. The examples are:    ta:ka-ti           to grow up (ta:ka-t ""man"")
    kukua-wits-ti     to prick (kuku(a) ""pain"" + wits- ""thorn"")
    teki-ti           to work (teki-t ""work"")For a detailed discussion of inchoative verbs in Nahua generally,
cf. Canger 1980.","[100, 101, 102, 103]"
"Cf. also, Cortés y Larraz (1958(1771).1:283).
   Brinton's evidence for identifying AlagUilac (Palacio's
Tlacacebastleca) as Pipil included a short word list collected by
Bromowicz in 1878 (published in Lehmann 1920:1062-7) and four
manuscript pages dating from 1610 to 1637 written in Nahuatl and
found in the Parrish archives of San Agustin Acasaguastlan. From
these Brlnton concluded that ""Alagüilac was a quite pure form of
the Nahuatl"" (Brinton 1887:376), closely related to the Pipil of
Escuintla (p.377). These data, however, do not warrant such con-
clusions. The list of words (cf. section 2) was from San Agustin
Acasaguastlan, the town identified in the colonial sources as
""Mexican"" and not AlaglÜlac in speech. Below it will become clear
that this ""Mexican"" indeed owes its origin to people from central
Mexico and has no special connection to Pipil. Futhermore, the
manuscript pages were written in Nahuatl, a central Mexican dialect
of Nahua. Por example, they contain forms with /tl/, which exists
only in dialects originally connected to central Mexico — Pipil
has only /t/, no /tl/. Some cases are:    ictle       good""           (CN ye:k-tli)

    ciuatlque   matrimonio""     (cf. CN siwa:tlanke ""he who helps to
                                  bring about marriages"")
    matlacti-   ""ten""           (CN ma'tlak-)It should be noted that Lehmann (1920:1061) also rejected Brinton's
identification, pointing to similar examples.
   There are at least two possible explanations of how the Mexican
dialect of Nahua registered in the four manuscript pages could come
to be in Acasaguastlan. One has to do with the fact that in New
Spain starting in 1570 the official policy was to make Nahuatl the
general language and no priest who did not know Nahuatl could take
charge of the missions or parishes (Heath 1972:27). This could
explain the Nahuatl fround in Acasaguastlan and in many other
church records of this period from Guatemala and Chiapas in places
where Nahuatl was never the language of the local population. Also
938
many Nahuatl speakers were settled in Guatemala on lands given to
the Mexican and Tlaxcalan auxiliaries who helped the Spanish in the
Conquest. For example, of the town of Los Esclavos in Central
Guatemala Ponce (1873(1586)) said:      LLamanse aquellos indios esclavos, porque realmente lo
      fueronde l o s españoles e l l o s y otros muchos, recien
      conquistada la tierra, quando no estaban las cosas tan
      asentadas ni con tan buen orden como agora están, y un
      presidente (Alonso López Cerrato) de la Audiencia de
      Guatemala lebertó mas de diez mil dellos y los pobló
      en diversas partes, y de aquí se quedaron con aquel
      nombre, hablan la lengua mexicana corrupta, que se
      llama lengua p i p i l (Miles 1957:740).","[953, 954]"

"   The orders:     Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)
     Verb-Subject-Object (VSO)also occur, but with less frequency. The order SVO is used speci-
fically to place greater emphasis on the subject. The VSO order is
rare except when the object is ""heavy"", i.e. when it contains a
relative clause or a coordinate noun phrase. In this way Pipil
conforms to the word-order universal that has been postulated for
VOS languages that a ""heavy"" object is not permitted and is usually
shifted to the end, giving VSO with heavy objects as a very common
104corollary order in basically VOS languages (cf. Campbell and Mithun
1981).
   The following are examples of other orders of transitive verb
sentences which have both an overt sujbect and object. The first
two illustrate VSO w i t h ""heavy"" objects. The third and fourth are
cases of VSO with the object bearing emphasis. The final two are
SVO sentences in which the subject is emphasized.","[117, 118]"
"3.7.3. Verb classes   It is almost possible to define the verb classes totally by
reference to their phonological form (cf. section 2.2), but this is
complicated by some exceptions and by certain verbs whose form
varies. Therefore, verb classes are defined here, and the dic-
tionary entries (chapter 5) indicate them by presenting verb tenses
and aspects which show their phonological form in each case. This
is important information, since the phonological shape is fre-
quently not predictable. It will be noticed, that the description
of Pipil verb classes is roughly equivalent to that presented for
Classical Nahuatl by Andrews (1975).",[84]
"     3.1.3.    Other nominal suffixes.   3.1.3.1.   -pan. The l o c a t i v e s u f f i x -pan ""on, upon, near""
(always in relation to the surface of something) i s not productive,
but i s found in the following forms:
                                                                  47

   xu:-pan      ""winter"" (rainy season) (xuxuwik ""green"" (?))   3.1.3.2. -tan. The locative suffix - t a n means approximately
""in, among, under, near, next to"". Historically it is closely
connected with -tani ""under, beneath, below"". It is also not
productive. Some examples are:  ka:ka:lu:-tan  San Julián          (cf. CN cacalo-tl ""crow"")
                   (place name)
  koh-tan (SD)   forest, woods        (kwawi- ""tree"")

suffix, -Jç after a vowel and -ku after a consonant, which basically
means ""in"". The examples are:   a:na:wa-k      breeze              (a:- ""water"" + na:wak ""near"")

   3.1.3.4. -ta(:)l. Pipil has a suffix which seems to be derived
from the root ta:l ""land"": its basic meaning seems to be ""place of
many"" of the things named by the noun root to which it is attached.
It corresponds to the Spanish suffix -al. -ar (e.g. platanal
""plantain grove"" (cf. plátano ""plantain""), piñal ""pine grove"" (cf.
pino ""pine""), frijolar ""bean patch"" (cf. frijol ""bean""), carrizal
""canebrake"" (cf. carrizo ""cane, reed""), cafetal ""coffee orchard"",
etc. It is possible that the meaning and perhaps even the origin
of this suffix has been influence by this Spanish case, given that
other Nahua varieties are not known to have such an ending. Forms
with this suffix are:     a:ka-tal   canebrake, place of reeds      (a:ka- ""reed"")
     a:ma-tal   many amate trees/paper          (a:ma- ""amate"")
     e:-tal     bean patch, bean field          (e:- ""bean"")
     saka-tal   pasture                        (saka- ""grass"")
     te-tá:l,   rocky place                    (te- ""stone"")
       tetal
     tewti-tá:l dusty ground                    (tew-ti ""dust"")
     uku-tal     pine grove                    (uku- ""pine"",
                                               cf. Sp. ocotal)
     u:wa-tal     canebrake, uncleared land    (u:wa- ""cane"", Sp.
                                                   huatal)
     wa:k-ta:1    dry ground                    (wa(:)ki ""dry"")   3.1.3.5. -ka. Pipil has some nouns which are derived from
verbs or adjectives by means of the suffix -ka. In other varieties
of Nahua this suffix, in addition to being a nominalizer, is re-
lated to the 'perfect' and the 'remote past'. Nevertheless, Pipil
has no 'remote past' and its 'perfect' forms do not include -ka.
Noun roots that take this suffix undergo vowel-loss (see section
2.2, rule 1). The following show it:     cha:mah-ka    waist          (cha:mawak ""thick"")
     i:xpil-ka     squatting      (i:xpilua ""to sqat"")
     mulin-ka      sprout         (mulu:ni ""to puff up"")
     -pat-ka       change         (pata ""to change"")
     pepetska      silver fish    (cf. pets-tik ""smooth"")
     pu:pu:l-ka    dregs          (pu:su:l ""posol"")
     tuhtuk-ka     brooding hen   (tu:ka ""to bury"" (?))
     tumah-ka       fat (n.)        (tuma:wak ""fat"" (Adj.))
     tsah-ka       lid            (tsakwa ""to close"")
     yaman-ka      lukewarm       (yama:nik ""bland"")
                                                                   49   Another very restricted suffix, which appears to be related to
this -ka. is the locative ending -kan. The few examples are:  ta-we:y-kan   country(side) (cf. we:y ""big"")
  ta-ne:s-kan   dawn, clearing (cf. ne:si ""to appear"")
  yeh-kan       alone, to the right (ye:k ""good"" (?))   3.1.3.6. -ni. The 'agentive' suffix -ni derives nouns from
verbs with the meaning of ""one who does the action of the verb"".
Some examples are:  atsakwa-ni       azacuan bird   (a:- ""water"" + tsakwa ""to cover"";
                                      literally ""water-coverer"")
  ehku-ni        ladino,          (ehku- ""to arrive"")
                   foreigner
  kuchi-ni       sleepy-head      (kuchi- ""to sleep"")
  kukuya-ni      sick person      (kukuya- ""to get sick"")
  ma:wiltiaya-ni playful person   (m-a:wiltia ""to play"")
  miki-ni        dead person      (miki- ""to die"")
  tacha-ni       lizard sp.       (ta-chiya- ""to look"")
  takwi:ka-ni    singer           (takwi:ka- ""to sing"")
  tapahtiya-ni   curer            (ta-pah-tia ""to cure"")
  tapa:ka-ni     washer woman     (ta-pa:ka- ""to wash"")
  tatu:ka-ni     planter, sower   (ta-tu:ka- ""to plant"")
  tatsa:wa-ni    weaver           (ta-tsa:wa- ""to weave"")
   3.1.3.7. -s. (-lis, - w i s , -was). The -s, suffix also derives
nouns from verbs, nouns which reflect the activity of the verb. It
is no longer productive, and Pipil has few examples:   tacha-li-s         appearance (ta-chiya ""to look"")
   yuyumuka-li-s     foot fungus (yuyumuka ""to itch"")
   kuku-li-s          sickness   (kuku-ya ""toget sick"")
   a:xa:l-uwa-s      whetstone   (cf. a:xa:l ""sand"")
   ku:-panu-wa-s     bridge       (ku:- 'wood'+ panu- ""to pass"")
   kwahsiwi-s        gumption
   taxwi:-s          pimple      (ta- + ixwi ""to fill"")
   tepu:na-wa-s      drum        (cf. pu:ni ""to burst"" ?)
   tsi:ku-wa-s       comb        (tsikwastia ""to comb"")
   uchpa:n-wa-s      broom       ((u)chpa:na ""to sweep"")   3.1.3.8. -tsin. The suffix -tsin is productive and has a
'diminutive' or 'reverential' function. In some words this suffix
bears the stress even though it may not be the penultimate
syllable. Also, it is pronounced at times as -chin instead of the
50expected    -tsin.   In plural     forms it Is       reduplicated,
tsintsin in many of the dialects, but -tsitsin in Cuisnahuat. Some
examples are:     a:yu:-tsin        turtle
     cha:kwah-tsin     storage hook
     chapa-chin        short(y)       mistun-tsin    kitten

which is not productive and occurs with few nouns. Its plural is
-pipil in Cuisnahuat and -pilpil in other locations. The examples
are:     iknu-pil       orphan
     -kwitapil      tail (cf. kwita-t ""excrement"")
     -nenepil       tongue
     siwa:-pil      girl (cf. siwa:-t ""woman"")   3.1.3.10. -1_ 'passive nominalization'. Many nouns are derived
from passive verbs with the suffix           resulting in passive
nominalizations, for example ta-kwa-1 ""food"", from ta-kwa ""to
eat"" + —_1 'passive nominalization'; or ta-xka-1 ""rigua, tortilla"",
from ta- 'something' + (i)xka ""to roast"", literally ""something
roasted"". Note that frequently nouns derived from verbs bear ta-
'unspecified object 1 (see section 3.3.4.4.). For more details on
passivization, see section 3.8.3.

complicated not only by the fact that there are several different
ways to form the plural, but also because some nouns take a combi-
nation of plural markers. The most common elements in plural
formations are reduplication (see below) and the suffix -t
'plural', also found in plural verb forms. Core Nahua has changed
this -t_ 'plural' to -ji or   thus Pipil is conservative in main-
taining this trait. The various plural markers are now taken up
individually.   (1) -ket is the most restricted plural marker, limited to a very
few human nouns:    lamat-ket,
      lah-lamat-ket      old women
    sih-siwa:t-ket       women
    xuh-xu:ret-ket       old men
    ukich-ket            males, men, husbands   (2) -me-t occurs with a larger, though still very limited
number of nouns; these are also, with few exceptions, 'human'
nouns:    ahsi:1-met               nits
    ah-alma-met              souls
    ah-alwa: si :1-me t      constables, policemen
    ehkuni-met               ladinos
    lah-lamah-tsi-tsin-met, little old women
      lah-lamah-chi-chin-met
    —ma :n—me t              brothers
    nah-na:n-met             mothers
    peh-pe:lu-met            dogs
    pipil-met                boys
    tah-ta:ka-met            men
    tixkwi-met               lazy persons
    tsih-tsinnanats-met      women with large buttocks
    uh-ukich-met             males, men
    xuh-xu:lu-met            babies   (3) -wan, as indicated above (31.2.1), is the plural of w
'possession' and is limited to a few kinship terms (which are in
character 'intimately' possessed).
