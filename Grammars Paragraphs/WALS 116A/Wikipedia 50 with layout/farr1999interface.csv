4.7.2.3 POLAR QUESTIONS
   Polar interrogative sentences often terminate with one or two tag words: ai? 'yes?' or ai
tefa? 'yes or no? ' . In declarative sentences, the copula in topic-comrnent clauses and the
final syllable of the verb in verbal clauses are pronounced with a falling pitch and may even
be devoiced. However, in polar questions, this syllable is often lengthened and distinctively
terminates the intonation contour to which it belongs. In many of the cases, it is assigned its
own intonation contour. The contour begins with a falling pitch, then manifests a slight
.- --        --
        148        Chapter 4        rising pitch and an optional falling pitch. The tag question words may also manifest
        rising-falling(-rising) or falling-rising(-falling) contours. The frequency range for the
        following examples l ies between 80 and 220 hertz, slightly higher than the range for
        declarative sentences and content questions. Polar questions terminate at a much higher
        pitch than do declarative sentences, except when the tag question word tefa occurs.
        Sentence accent in polar questions slightly modifies the stress patterns for individual words,
        especially that of future tense verbs. This is illustrated in the examples below. Example
        4. 1 06 has no tag words.
        4. 1 06 Ni geka s-aresa?
                2S talk    say.I-F.2S.FN
                ' Do you want to make a comment?'","[167, 168]"

4.7.2.4 COMMANDS
   All imperative sentences have the illocutionary force of commands. They are expressed
in order to get the addressee to modify his or her behaviour in some way. Commands are
manifested by independent clauses that terminate with an imperative (having the -u speech­
act-value marker when plural or imperfective) or a hortative form of the verb. Korafe
hortative and imperative final-verb paradigms are detailed in §§2.4. 1 0, 2.4. l 1 and 2.4. 1 2.
The Korafe commands are uttered at a higher frequency range than any other sentence type,
between 1 05 and 260 Hz.
   Commands generally differ from other sentences in that they do not have topical
constituents, unless an addressee is mentioned. The peak of the intonation contour with the
highest frequency is consistently above 200 Hz, higher than peaks of intonation contours
found in most other sentence (except in some instances of polar questons). They also tend
to terminate higher than any sentence type other than polar questions having the tag
question, ai 'yes' .
   Example 4. 1 09 was uttered when the speaker and addressees were i n close proximity.
Therefore, it begins at a fairly low frequency for commands ( 1 50.7 Hz) and terminates at a
low frequency for commands ( 1 1 2.8 Hz).",[170]

1.6 TYPOLOGY
  Korafe is morphologically agglutinating, primarily hosting suffixes and enclitics. It
exhibits both head-marking and dependent-marking strategies:
                                           head-marking               dependent-marking
                   clauses                 predicates                oblique arguments
                                           auxiliary verbs
                   noun phrases            nouns                     qualifiers
                                                                     possessors
20    In Farr and FaIT ( 1 974:26), this vowel length was interpreted as word tone. And a slight down-glide
      often does accompany the lengthened vowel.
21    There are two other subsidiary rules for the today's past and future tense paradigms that constitute
      exceptions to this general rule. These are: ( I ) stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable when a today's
      past tense verb form has more than two syllables (e.g. seteni 'I said', tendeni ' I lashed', but beni ' I got'),
      and (2) stress perturbs from the initial syllable of the future tense suffix to the second syllable when the
      focused element in the clause is not the verb (e.g. Na yarena ' I will go', Na Tufi yarena ' I will go to
      Tufi. ).
           '
                                                                                Introduction   15   The unmarked order of core constituents i n the clause is subject-object-verb (sov), but
word order of clausal constituents is fairly free with the one stipulation that the verb be last.
In fact, the verb is the only constituent of the clause that obligatorily occurs. Any argument
that is recoverable from the discourse context or the external deictic situation can be elided.
   Korafe distinguishes two major open word classes: nominals and verbs. Nominals
include words that correspond to the categories: noun, qualifier, quantifier, numerator, and
adverb in English. Processes that apply to nominals include inflecting for plurality,
intensity, and/or specific focus, but nominals usually occur without inflections. As is typical
for Papuan languages, verbs are morphologically complex, undergoing agglutinating and
fusional processes which link stems with their corresponding inflections. Verb forms differ
from nominals in the inflectional categories they host, intensification strategies, and the
stress rules that apply to them.
   Closed word classes having referential function in discourse are personal pronouns,
interrogatives/indefinites, and demonstratives-deictics. Other closed word classes include:
postpositions, conjunctions, and sentential focus markers. Interjections, response words and
greetings are numerically limited, but the Korafe repertoire is expanding to include English
interjections and responses.
   Postpositions often cliticise to the preceding noun phrase or sentence base that they
relate to a larger construction or to the discourse deictic context. They function as: ( 1 )
semantic case role markers, (2) markers of pragmatic functions, and (3) modal indicators.
Markers of semantic case roles and pragmatic functions are enumerated, and their
function(s) with noun phrases are specified in Chapter 3. Some combinations of these
postpositions with nominals, personal pronouns, demonstratives, and interrogatives/
indefinites are lexically frozen (e.g. sovenida ' across from' , eloda ' on top of' , ikxida,
dengesida 'beside', all nominals occurring with the general locative postposition da to
specify a position).
   Epistemic and deontic modals terminate sentence bases and left-dislocated themes. The
speaker uses these indicators to declare his or her orientation or attitude towards the deictic
situation detailed. They include: vae 'I'm exasperated', ta ' I ' m annoyed' , lano 'probably
so', tanojo 'perhaps', asi 'certainly (a-si, that-saY.II.evidential indicating reported speech)',
re 'relevant to the immediate deictic situation' and the related demonstrative sets ere, are,
ore which spatially link the event to the speaker, the addressee, or some place away from
both.
   Four personal pronoun stems occur in Korafe: na ' 1 ' , ni 'you' , nu 'he, she,it', and ne
'you (pL)/they' . Frozen combinations of these stems with enclitics are used to make dual
and plural as well as first person inclusive and exclusive distinctions. Only pronominal
stems occur with the actor focus suffix -ne and the limiter -suka 'only ' . The nominal
10/0/1010/0 ' self/selves' is used as a reflexive form or to emphasise the subject in a clause
(which is usually a pronoun). Reciprocal relationships are signalled by t% t% .
   Interrogative and indefinite words arise from four basic stems. Two are basically
pronominal : ave/mave 'who' and re ' what' . The referential specifier -jo (avejo ' who
specifically?') and semantic case role and pragmatic function markers occur with these two
16    Chapter 1pronominal forms. The stem ningi 'which' always combines with forms that are based on
                                                                                          ,
the demonstrative a 'that' (ningia 'which one?'). The verb stem nange 'how (lit. do what)
is the only Korafe verb that may be followed by the comparative postposition go/gao In
content questions, the question word retains the same position in the clause as its
antecedent except in the case of subject where OSV order often occurs.
   All members of the Binandere family manifest the same three-way set of demonstrative
stems: e 'this near the speaker', a 'that near the addressee' , and 0 'that away from both ' .
Markers o f pragmatic functions directly follow demonstratives (amo 'regarding that one',
ava 'that as opposed to any others'). Modal enclitics also occur with the demonstrative set
(amasi 'regarding that certain one'). Semantic case role markers or the pro-verb ge 'do
(FOCUS)' follow one of the pragmatic effector of change markers i or mi (aindae ' on
                                                                          ,
account of that', aminda 'there', aminge 'do thus'). The term 'deictics 22 encompasses the
entire range of demonstrative-based forms.
   Korafe contrasts with some Papuan23 languages in having upwards of 20 conjunctions
and conjunction complexes, which are related to demonstrative forms and/or same-subject
medial verb forms. An inventory of these forms and their functions in co-ranking sentences
is catalogued in Chapter 8. Their function in SRCs is outlined in §6.2.4.
   Sentential focus particles include the negative focus marker jo ' not' , the proposition
specifier nu 'this proposition selected from the available ones', taka 'just, frustratingly' .
Sentential focus words such as avose 'perhaps (lit. that. CT. say)' and avori 'all right (lit.
             ,
that.cT.coP) may also occur in isolation as response words. Other than jo which precedes
the negated constituent in focus, these sentential focus markers either occur sentence­
initially or following the subject and are often set off by pauses from the rest of the
sentence. Tag markers for polar questions (e.g. ai 'yes?', ai tefo 'yes or no?' ) also belong to
this class. However, they are set off at the terminus of the sentence by pauses.
   Interjections (termed yove in Korafe) are a small set of uninflected words and fixed
expressions that the Korafe employ to express emotional reactions (e.g. mara 'what a
shame' , arie ' wow! '). Among the response words and expressions the Korafe use are:
aavori 'that' s sufficient', aii 'yes' , and aiyakoe or tanik yu 'thank you' . Like the sentential
focus particles, interjections and response words may be set off from an accompanying
sentence by pauses; but more normally they are uttered in isolation associated with an
intonation contour that can display considerable pitch variation. Greetings and farewells
(termed ategi in Korafe) occur in isolation or with a vocative expression. The current daily
greeting Sifo eveva! ' Good day ! (lit. day good)' has largely replaced the traditional
greetings using present tense forms of verbs (e.g. /resa! 'You are staying! ' , Refesa! ' You
are coming! ', Ravasi! 'You have slept! '). Command forms of verbs (e.g. Anumbeyo! 'Sit ! ' ,
/yo! ' Go ! ' , A viyo! ' S leep ! ') continue to b e used a s farewells. Interj ections and other
utterances that are shouted at a distance terminate with an -0.","[34, 35, 36]"

2.3.2 PERSON AND NUMBER OF SUBJECT
   Five persons are distinguished in Korafe finite verb forms: first, second and third person
singular, first and third person plural conflated, and second person plural. Table 2.4 shows
the five person indexes and their occurrence in some suffix sets.

are: ira*li, a*lara, and areleure. From the overall pattern, i t is possible to posit that 3 S
is realised by 0 or by an underlying morpheme that triggers the mid to high vowel shifts
(e � i and 0 � u) seen in -esa (2S) � -ira (3S) and -eose (2S) � -eure (3 S). The -ra
appears to be a unit, apocopating in third person singular forms predicating content
questions and occurring terminally in third person dependent final forms for near past and
yesterday'S past tenses ?O
2.3.3 SPEECH-ACT VALUE
   The final partial in the suffix set expresses the speech-act value the speaker assigns to
the sentence. Korafe speakers use four speech-act value markers : -a, -i, -e and -0.
   The -e and -0 appear to be deictic spatio-temporal and psychological orienters, related to
the demonstratives e 'this' and 0 'that, far off. As Table 2.3 illustrates, the -e is the speech-20
     The -ra occurs in complementary distribution with -a as allomorphs of the speech-act value partial { -a} .
     The -ra occurs with third person singular independent indicative and dependent final forms; the -a with
     non-third person independent indicative non-past final forms and dependent final forms.
     The -ra could also be related to the copula ri, -ra indicating neutrality with regard to assertion and ri the
     speaker's commitment to the factuality of the marked clause.
                                                                                              Korafe verbs      39act value partial in the two hortative suffix sets. The speaker uses the -e to communicate his
or her view of the temporal proximity of the event and to request that the addressee get
involved in this activity, or conversely, that he or she should not carry it out. The -0
terminates all utterances that are called out to an addressee at some distance away from the
speaker. It is also used as the final recurrent partial in the suffix sets in os medial verb
paradigms (with the exception of third person singular forms).
    The speech-act value markers that usually occur with final verb suffix sets are {-a} and
{ -i}, z l Korafe uses both { -a} and { _i} 22 to mark indicative verbs in declarative sentences.
The { -a} marks all non-past indicative final verbs, i.e. future tense, customary aspect, and
present tense forms. It also marks all third person forms of indicative final verbs, regardless
of tense. The { -i} serves as the speech act value marker on past tense verb forms other than
the third person singular forms. From an analysis of the fixed and productive usages of the
speech act value markers { - i } and { - a} in Korafe, the following pattern can be
hypothesised. The speech-act value marker { - i } appears to register the speaker' s
                                               2
commitment to the factuality o r desirability 3 o f the ideas being expressed; the use of the
speech-act value marker { -a} does not.
     The consistent use of { -a} in a non-past tense is illustrated in 2.43a and b.
2.43a. PRESENT TENSE:
          Embavo                     re-j-irg.

2.43b. Na re-j-eng.
          I S IPF-come.DUR-PRES. 1 S.FN
          ' I ' m on my way.'
   I n the examples in 2 .44a and b, the use of {-a} with third person is contrasted with the
use of { -i} with first person in the distant past tense final verb forms.
2.44      D ISTANT PAST TENSE:
          a. Nu May fu-sirg.                               b.   Na May fu-senf.

                ' He came in May.'                               'I came in May. '
21     The second person plural speech-act value marker i s -u, not i (e.g. selesi 'you (s ) said', but selevu 'you
                                                                     -
       (PL) said'). The person and number of subject markers that precede -i (-n, -s, r ) all have the feature
                                                                                          -
       [+coronal]; the 2PL marker -v does not. Stem II verb forms (introductory section ( 1 ) of this chapter) also
       manifest this alternation.
22     Korafe is atypical of Binandere languages, which manifest -G to signal indicative mood for all tenses.
       Documented languages are: Suena (Wi lson 1 974: 1 ,5-6), Zia (Wilson 1 980); B inandere (Capell
       1 969b: 1 0, 1 9), Ewage-Notu (Parrington 1 9787: 1 9) and Orokaiva (Larsen and Larsen 1 982:26,27,90). The
       -i is used to mark content questions in Suena, Zia, Binandere and Ewage-Notu.
23     Lyons ( 1 977:748-50) defmes Hare's 'neustic' as ""that part of the sentence which expresses the speaker's
       commitment to the factuality, desirability, etc. of the propositional content conveyed by the phrastic
       [propositional content of the sentence]"".
40   Chapter 2   In addition to occurring with past tense final verb forms, the { - i } is the terminal
recurrent partial on final verbs that are predicates of content questions. Even though both
examples 2 .45 and 2.46 utilise the today' s past tense paradigm, the second person singular
verb forms having indicative mood 2.45a and predicating a content question 2.45b do not
differ in form, but the corresponding third person singular forms illustrated in 2.46a and b
do differ.

       ' What specific topic did he discuss?'
   The { -a} is used to mark all dependent final verbs. In the following examples 2.47 and
2.48 , the a. examples are sentences that terminate with an independent fmal verb. The same
lexical verb in the b. examples is a dependent final verb. In 2.47b, this verb is the predicate
of a replacive relative clause.

   In example 2 .48a, ojeni marked with the speech-act value marker { -i} terminates the
sentence. The ojena marked by { -a} is the predicate of the dependent base in 2.48b, an
adversative sentence.

   Although the use of the speech-act value markers { -a} and {-i} is primarily fixed in
Korafe, there are some contexts where the choice of { -a} or { -i} depends upon the speaker
and the perspective he or she wishes to communicate. Hence in example 2.49a, the speaker
uses {-i} instead of the expected {-a} marker to indicate his strong desire to meet up with
the other person. His use of {-a} in 2.49b indicates that he is not really committed to a long
search.

        ' I will go, but I doubt I ' ll find him. (The chances of finding him are very slim.
        There are just too many obstacles.)'
   In example 2.50a, the {-i} signals a proposition that the speaker believes the addressee
does not share with him, so he asserts it. In 2.50b, the {-a} signals a proposition that the
speaker assumes he and the addressee both presuppose.
2.50a. Na uju + erena,                Jamie fur-aett-
        I S want+IPF .do. PRES. I S.D Jamie come.DUR.IPF-CFAC.3S.AQ

        'I would like Jamie to come. (And you and I both know it's expected that
        Jamie be there. I won't take no for an answer.)'
    From the above examples and others arises the hypothesis expressed above, that the
speech-act value marker { -i} registers the speaker' s commitment to the factuality or
desirability of the ideas being expressed; the use of the speech-act value marker { -a} does
not. The { - a} marks presuppositions and uncompleted events that do not require the
speaker' s wholehearted commitment to their validity or desirability, because the addressee
shares them with the speaker or at least is assumed to share them, or they are not firmly
established as facts. Past events can be validated, so they are encoded in sentences that
assert them as facts, sentences terminated by a final verb marked by { -i} or by the copula
rio This hypothesis is less satisfactory as an explanation for the fixed uses of { -a} with all
third person indicative forms and { - i } with all content questions ?4 An alternative24   One might posit that content questions are marked with { -i} , because the very utterance of the content
     question signals the speaker's commitment to the actual existence of the item in question or the actual or
     projected occurrence of the event for which information is sought.
42       Chapter 2explanation is that Korafe has inherited these fixed usages from an earlier stage in its
development.","[58, 59, 60, 61, 62]"

17   The term 'sentence' is not easily defined. Three types differentiated by Lyons ( 1 977:622-635) are:
     system-sentences, text-sentences, and utterance-units. System-sentences can be generated from the
     formal grammatical rules without reference to any deictic or endophoric context. Text-sentences are
     ""context-dependent utterance-signals (or parts of utterance-signals)"" (Lyons 1 977:622). Utterance-units
     are a subset of utterances which Harris ( 1 95 1 : 1 4) defines as ""any stretch of talk by one person, before
     and after which there is silence on the part of that person"". Simple utterance units ""contain one and only
     one simple proposition"" and ""are the basic units of language behaviour"" (Lyons 1 977:633).
          The term ' simple sentences' used here approximates the abstract grammatical construct termed
     ' system-sentences', allowing, as Lyons ( I 977:626) suggests, that at least some part of their prosodic
     structure, including their intonation contour, be accounted for. Declarative, interrogative and imperative
     sentences are system-sentences with a particular grammatical structure. When system-sentences are
     contextualised by language speakers, they can be regarded as ""utterance-un its-to which such terms as
     ' statement', 'question', and 'command' are applicable ( 1 977:633).""

In example 4.96, the speaker uses ta to express his annoyance with the addressee and with
the current state of affairs.

   I n addition to the base, Korafe simple sentences may have initial peripheral segments,
one or more themes (P2), and a tail (P3). Initial peripheral segments usually occur sentence­
initially, but sometimes they follow the theme, as shown in example 4.95 . The initial
peripheral constituents include evaluative/pause words and vocatives. Examples of
evaluative (or pause) words are avori 'all right', avose 'perhaps', rnrn 'yes' and others.
Vocatives may follow evaluative words or be the initial segment in a sentence. They are
                                                                                        ,
either a person's name or kin relationship optionally followed by ko 'dear (honorific) or 0
'that (distal-2 used in declamations)' . Example 4.97 illustrates an evaluative peripheral
word followed by a vocative kin expression. The base is simply a predicate filled by a verb
in the hortative form.
4.97   Avori, nanda rnandi, yaore!
       all.right l S.GEN boy,      go.NDUR-IR.H . l PL.CR
       'All right, my boy, let's go ! '
   Like initial peripheral segments, themes are separated off by a pause from the rest o f the
sentence. In simple sentences, themes may either be NPs or PPs which may be additionally
marked by a topic marker (rno or va). Section 3 .2.3 . 1 provides fuller details and examples
of themes.
   Tails (P3) follow the sentence base. The tag words, ai 'yes ' , ai tefo 'yes or no' often
mark polar questions and are used along with prosodic features to distinguish them from
other sentence types. Examples are given in §4.7.2.3. Other examples of tail constituents
can be found in §3.2.3 . 1 .","[159, 160]"

6.2.2 OPERATION OF ONE PROPOSITIONAL VALUE OVER SRCs
  The SRC functions as a sentential unit, either as a presupposition 1 1 or as a proposition
with illocutionary force. In the latter case, only one illocutionary act is performed when the
SRC is uttered. This illocutionary act can be either ( 1 ) a statement, (2) a question, or (3) a
command. An SRC cannot contain both a statement and a command, as some co-ranking11    The term 'presupposition' is used here to refer to something the speaker assumes as given for the
      context in which he or she makes his utterance. This pretheoretical defmition is basically pragmatic,
      opposing presuppositions with assertion. It is not a ' semantic' notion, defmed in terms of truth­
      conditions, opposing presuppositions with entailments (Lyons 1 977:600).
1 90     Chapter 6sentences do. The same interactive features that indicate the illocutionary force of a simple
sentence illustrate the illocutionary force of an SRC. These features (discussed in §4.7) are
reviewed here and illustrated.
( 1 ) The SRC can contain one and only one dependent or independent final verb, marked by
      a speech-act-value marker, {-i}, -a, or -e in accordance with the specifications given in
      §2.3.3.
(2) The frequency and amplitude contours in the rhythm group(s) assigned to the SRC
    follow the patterns illustrated in §4.7 and its subsections for statements, content
    questions, commands, and polar questions or they terminate with a fal ling rising
    intonation contour which characterises presuppositional material. Pauses can occur SRC
    internally.
(3) Only one modal particle (or two tag words, e.g. ai te/o 'yes no?') can occur at SRC
    terminus; they cannot occur SRC internally. Only one evaluative word, such as avose
    ' perhaps' , may occur sentence-initially or after the subject NP in the initial clause.
    Pause words, such as avori 'all right' can occur several times in an SRC .
   The following SRC has the illocutionary force of a statement. The epistemic modal asi
'thus said' occurs at its terminus. It contains two clauses, which fall under the scope of one
rhythm group with five intonation contours: ( 1 ) na (2) ya-ma (3) a- (4) -fa (5) ga-re-na-si.
6. 1 7    Na y-ama                         a/a    g-aren-asi.
          I S go.DUR-SEQ.IR. SS.EMP father See.l-F . I s.FN-that.say.II
          ' I will go and see father, that was said! '
In auditory analysis, the a in a/a 'father' was considered to be the accented syllable in the
utterance. In the instrumental analysis, however, the ya in yama ' (I ) will go' was the
longest syllable at 3 1 8 milliseconds, the loudest syllable in the first clause at 83.3(- 1 .6dB),
and was given the highest pitch in the utterance: 1 78.5 Hz. The a in a/a was given the
highest pitch in the second clause: 1 72.5 Hz. The re in garenasi ' I will see, that was said'
was the loudest syllable in the utterance at 93 .0(-0.6dB) and the longest syllable in the
second clause, enduring 226 milliseconds.","[209, 210]"

II
        Only complements tenninating with deverbals can occur with the complementisers m a (topic/focus),
        va (contrastive topic/focus), and a 'that'. Complements terminating with dependent fmal verbs can
        occur without a complementiser when they are phonologically set apart from the rest of the sentence.
        Or they occur with demonstratives marked for pragmatic roles (e.g. ama 'that (topical)', ava 'that
        (contrastive)', and semantic roles (e.g. aminda 'there', aindae ' for that one').
12
        Dixon ( 1 987:3) defmes secondary verbs as verbs which ""relate to some action or state and demand a
        grammatical link to another verb"".
                                                                                        Noun phrases     793 .43    Mandi koti-sira,               na nombura=i              b-ari=a             koti-sira ...

         ' (My) son thought that a crocodile had gotten me. (lit. The boy thought, a crocodile
         had gotten me he thought.)'
The above deverbal complement clauses express hypothetical events. Because deverbals
are used when it is not necessary to assign temporal boundaries to the information given in
the complement, they can encode real events or hypothetical events. In example 3 .44, the
event encoded by the deverbal complement clause is neither established nor denied. 1 3

         'John did not believe that Mary died. (And the speaker doesn't know either
         whether Mary is dead or not.)'
  The following example consists of two polar questions that ask the addressee to make an
evaluation. The complements and the complementisers are underlined .

Example 3 .46 contains a deverbal complement, for which an evaluation is expressed.

   Korafe has one other complement structure encoding customary verbal action. This noun
phrase has three constituents : ( 1 ) a genitive PP modifying (2) the nominal head (comprised
of the periphrastic verb sequence encoding sporadic iteration), followed by (3) a
demonstrative ava. This complement construction has object function (cf. discussion of the
object (0) function on page 1 1 6) in the matrix clause in which it is embedded. The referent
of the possessor is coreferential with the referent of the subject of the dependent final verb
in this construction. The English gloss of example 3 .47 could be translated by a gerund
'their doings', but the Korafe has a fully inflected dependent final verb.","[98, 99]"

4.7.2.2 CONTENT QUESTIONS
   Content or information-seeking questions always manifest two components: ( 1 ) a
content question pro-word (e.g. rnave 'who?', rejo 'what?' , nange 'what event?, how?') and
(2) a predicate with the modal orientation suffix for assertions and content questions, {-i} .
The question pro-word is the constituent given focus function. It either occurs near the verb
or in the position of the word it is replacing. In the following examples, the inherently
stressed syllables of both topic and focus constituents are accented. In both of these
examples, the topic word contains the longest syllable with the highest pitch. The focus
pro-word contains the syllable with the greatest amplitude. Content questions resemble
declarative sentences in having a variety of intonation contour patterns and terminating
with a downglide.
      The content question in example 4. 1 04 is realised by a topic-comment question.
4. l 03 Ni rnave-jo=ri?
        2S whO-SPEC=COP.AQ
        ' Who are you?'
The topic ni 'you' is 269 milliseconds long and has the highest pitch ( 1 96.7 Hz). The
syllable ve of the focal constituent rnavejo has the greatest amplitude (2 1 .5(- 1 3 .4dB)). The
lowest pitch (94.0 Hz) and the lowest amplitude (2.8(-3 1 . 1 dB)) occur at utterance terminus.
The graphs of the two men's utterances closely resemble each other.",[166]

18   Unlike innate word stress, a pitch is not necessarily connected with one syllable, but may extend over
     several syllables. However, there are minor pitch fluctuations on every syllable.
19   The fluctuation before fa seems too slight to warrant assigning it its own intonation contour.

    Keghana assigns the greatest posItIve amplitude to the topical component, n i
'you' (which is 3 3 . 1 (-9.6dB) as compared with the amplitude of the focal constituents,
yaresa 'you will go' with ya at 29.4 (- 1 0.6dB) and tela 'no' with te at 27.2 (- 1 1 .3dB)). He
assigns the highest pitch to ya in yaresa (2 1 2.2 Hz as compared with ni which registers
1 7 1 .8 Hz at its highest pitch level). The longest syllable is ya in yaresa at 25 1 milliseconds;
the focal element, ai 'yes', is second longest at 242 milliseconds. Thus, the focal
constituent yaresa is the most accented element in the utterance, ranking first in pitch and
in length and a close second in loudness.
     Seko assigns the highest pitch to the topical component, ni 'you' (2 1 3 .0 Hz as compared
to ya in yaresa 'you will go' which registers 204.6 Hz). The ya in yaresa has the greatest
amplitude in the utterance (32.9 (-9.7dB) as compared to the te in tela ' no' at 24.8
(- 1 2 . 1 dB)). The longest syllable is ai 'yes', at 284 milliseconds, ni is second at 274
milliseconds, and the ya in yaresa is third at 26 1 milliseconds. In the initial auditory
evaluation of this utterance, the focal constituent yaresa appeared to be the most accented
element to all of us listening to the tape. However, the instrument measurements indicate
that yaresa and ni are pretty much on a par. The focal yaresa ranks first in loudness and is
second in pitch and third in length, while the topical ni has the highest pitch and is second
in length and third in loudness.
   Because the focused constituent is the centre of the message the speaker intends to
communicate, it tends to be the most accented element. But, as demonstrated above, the
topic also may be strongly accented. Focal constituents that frequently draw the strongest
accent to them are: ( 1 ) the final lexical verb in a verbal predicate or the stressed word
before the copula in copular predicates, (2) the negative deverbal ae ' not do' in negated
clauses, (3) focus words, such as the focal actor pronouns, the negative specifier ja and the
                                                      Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences    1 43proposition specifier nu, and (4) the interrogative pro-word in content questions. The
Korafe can indicate two significant focal constituents by signalling one with increased
amplitude and the other with higher pitch. In the sample taken, the greatest amplitude is
consistently associated with a syllable of a focal constituent. In over 80% of the cases, the
syllable with the highest pitch also belongs to a focal constituent, but only 1 8.3% of the
examples assign both high pitch and loudness to the same syllable. A syllable belonging to
the topical constituent registers the highest pitch in 25% of the examples and the greatest
length in 50% of the examples.
   The examples illustrating sentence types in the following sections were recorded by
Kingsley Seko (KS: age 65) and Bensted Keghana ( BK: age 5 1 ) in February 1 995 at Baga
village in the Tufi district of the Oro Province. At that point, an auditory analysis using four
relative pitches20 was made both by the men and this writer. Although accent was originally
perceived as high pitch in the auditory analysis, the instrumental analysis by computer
revealed it was only in a little more than half the sentences that high or very high pitch was
the predominant feature associated with syllables perceived to have the greatest accent. For
the others, increased loudness and, occasionally, length played a more significant role. The
computer-produced graphs of amplitude curves and intonation contours convey a more
accurate and complete picture than the 4-pitch auditory analysis, so they are presented with
the examples in the following sections.
    The examples illustrate some trends in the use of intonation contours, loudness, and
length in Korafe sentences. However, the speaker's attitudes at utterance time and motives
in making the utterance also influence the shape of intonation contours, the assignment of
loudness and length, and the positioning of pauses, overlaying and modifying any general
patterns there are. 21 A complete study of the prosodic combinations that are associated with
attitudes such as doubt, relief, joy, grief and anger is beyond the scope of this book.","[161, 162, 163]"

           ' While you are speaking thus, why are you placing the responsibility on me?'
If the final verb in 6. 1 9 were indicating that the sentence has the illocutionary force of a
statement rather than a content question, its form would be fifiteresa ' you were placing' .
   Although the final clause o f an SRC may not contain the focal element questioned, it still
contains the only verb in the SRC marked with the speech-act value for content questions. In
example 6.20, the interrogative pro-word rejo 'what specifically' occurs as the object of the
initial clause that terminates with a medial verb fugeteso 'you threw and' .

          'What did you throw that while the dog is eating (it), he is growling?,
The nominal+verb combination gangara resi ' is he growling?, is the only verb that is
marked to indicate that example 6.20 is a content question. Even though this particular
clause does not have any constituent being questioned, it carries the speech-act value that
indicates the illocutionary force of the entire sentence. If it were marked as a statement, it
would be gangara resira 'he is growling' .",[211]
"
3 .2.3.3 OTHER MORPHOLOGICAL MARKERS OF PRAGMATIC CONSTITUENTS
   The following morphological markers also indicate pragmatic constituents: ( 1 ) current
relevancy markers and ani, (2) modal thematic markers (asi and ta), (3) personal pronouns
including focal actor pronominal set, (4) interrogative pronouns and other forms, and (5)
contrastive specifiers (jo and nu).
   The current relevancy marker re 'here is, currently in focus' marks THEME NPs, given
information the speaker assumes is ""already activated"" (Chafe 1 976:30) in the mind of the
addressee. The noun phrases or noun clauses marked by re are part of the gestural or
symbolic deictic context of the speech act, as illustrated in 3 . 1 3 8 .
3 . 1 3 8 Dudley=re,          a=ni         buva=ghae, a=vo=ri.
          Dudley=COP.here that=COP.there scar=COM.D that=CT=COP.AQ
          ' Dudley here (you want to know which of the twins is Dudley), he' s that
          one with the scar, that one.'
   The modal markers asi ' that certainly was said (reported speech) ' and ta 'unexpectedly,
frustratingly' follow final verbs. They also mark THEME NPs, as shown in examples 3 . 1 39
and 3 . 1 40.
3 . 1 39 Father=masi,              bagia+kato=ri.
         Father=T/F.that.sayJI thief+repeated.doer=coP.AQ
         ' Father, they certainly say, is a thief.'
3 . 1 40 A =mo=ta,        ir-ira                  a=mo!
         that=T/F=FRUS remain-PRES.3S.FN that=TIF
         ' There, you ninny, it' s right over there (near you) ! '
1 08    Chapler 3   Personal pronouns signal contrast, marking the referential animate NP as the significant
one in a set. Two sets of pronouns have pragmatic FOCUS function: ( 1 ) the exclusive focal
actor set with -ne and the (2) exclusive focal experiencer set with -mo+a. Like { imi} , the
exclusive focal actor personal pronoun set (nane ' I myself, nine 'you, yourself , nune 'he
himself , and nene ' they themselves') marks its referent as the specific initiator of the
action encoded by the verbal predicate. However, unlike { im i } , this set is restricted to
clause-internal function, as syntactic subject, semantic AGENT, and pragmatic FOCUS. This
set must be used when a personal pronoun has subject function in an osv-ordered clause.
Therefore, example 3 . 1 4 1 b is ill-formed.
3 . 1 4 1 a. Na nune        de-lira.              b.   *Na nu de-tira.
             I S 3S.ACT hiu-TP.3S.FN                      I S 3S hit. l-TP.3S.FN
             ' It was he that hit me. '                * ' 1 he hit. '
This set indicates the focal actor in both transitive (3. 1 4 1 ) and intransitive (3 . 1 42) clauses.
3 . 1 42 Randall nune        i-sira.
         Randall 3S.ACT go. DUR-DP.3S.FN
         ' It was Randall himself that went. (He'll represent us well.)'
The pronominal referent undergoing some action can be singled out by adding mo+a to the
pronominal root forms, as illustrated by namoa 'me myself in example 3 . 1 43 .
3 . 1 43 Nu na=mo=a de-lira.
         3S I S=TIF=that hit.I-TP.3S.FN
         ' It was me that he hit! '
   I nterrogative p ronouns and other interrogative forms have FOC U S function in
clauses or sentence bases, drawing the accent of the intonation contour to their inherently
stressed syllable, as examples 4. 1 04 and 4. 1 05 illustrate.
   The negation marker jo ' not' is a contrastive specifier that immediately precedes the
focused constituent in the clause or takes the accent in the intonation contour and is itself
the focused constituent. Its function and distribution are detailed more fully in §4.6.
   When the contrastive specifier n ll occurs as THEME, it signals the topic for discussion
that the speaker is selecting out of a range of possible topics, as in example 3 .98 above.
When nu follows the TOPIC in a clause that is part of the initial base in a sentence, it marks
that base as the one contrastively focused on. In example 3 . 1 44, the speaker is correcting a
misapprehension of the addressee, by marking the event he knows occurred, contrasting it
with the non-event which he believes the addressee thinks occurred.
3 . 1 44 Nu nu kambo=da a-ira,                             a=va=ta            vikoko
         3S � house=LOC go.NDUR-TP.3S.FN                   that=CT=FRUS(=but) knife
       jo      b-ae=ri.
       NEG get.I-not.do=coP.AQ
        ' He did go to the house (it' s true), but he didn't get the bush knife.'
   This specifier is further discussed in § 8 . 1 2.

               CLAUSES, PREDICATES, PREDICATIONS AND SENTENCES4. 1 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
   This chapter surveys Korafe clauses/predications and briefly outlines the structure and
intonation patterns of simple sentences.
   Clauses roughly correspond to the semantic notion of full predications, i.e. predications
with both participatory and circumstantial semantic arguments. The predication types
detailed in the following sections are based on the correspondence between the number of
core arguments that can occur and the semantic roles these arguments play. Predication
types in Korafe are either stative or active. Non-verbal clauses and clauses with iri ' remain'
express states of affairs. Other verbal predicates express events, the verb stem being an
""event classifier: a verb stem denoting a kind of action [or process] , conceptually simple or
complex"" (Pawley 1 987:33 5-3 36).
   Simple sentences have two basic components: a base with accompanying prosodies.
Because the base of a simple sentence corresponds syntactically to a clause and
semantically to a predication, predication types are presented first in the fol lowing
discussion. The simple sentences surveyed in the final section of this chapter are:
statements, content questions, polar questions, and commands.","[127, 128, 129]"

        Several Korafe fonns used as conjunctions have other senses. For instance, ailai means 'yes' and ·or' .
        These forms may be either homophonous or polysemous. In the working Korafe-English dictionary,
        they are listed this way:
           ailai intj . ( 1 ) yes
           conj. (2) or
260      Chapter 8The conjunction ailai 'or' occurs only with binary alternatives. In the following elicited
example, either one can be used.
8.22a.      Demusi=ri,             0,      Evertius       y-arira?
            Demus=COP.AQ or           Evertius    go.DUR-F.3S.FN
            ' Will it be Demus or will Evertius go (or will they both go)?'
8.22b.      Demusi=ri,             ai,     Evertius       y-arira?
            Demus=COP.AQ or           Evertius    go.DUR-F.3S.FN
            ' Will it be Demus or, will Evertius go?
If 0 is used, both men may end up going, whereas with ailai, the speaker's expectation is
that only one man will go.
   Where all the options are simultaneously possibilities, 0 is used. Thus, only 0 can occur
in example 8 .23, a sentence with multiple alternatives .

            will go and get pandanus, come and beat it and put it (in the sun), and it will
            dry, and she will weave (it into a mat).'
   Example 8.24 illustrates a binary alternative with the conjunction ailai.
8 .24       Nu y-arira                   ai, ir-arira?
            3S go.DUR-F.3S.FN or remain-F.3S.FN
            ' Will he go or will he stay?'
The disjunctive ailai is obligatory in this sentence where only one alternative can be
selected.
   The 0 can be used between a statement and its paraphrase. In 8.25 which is a
hypothetical condition, base 2 in the apodosis is a paraphrase of base 1 . The two bases are
joined by o.

   The 0 can also be used to express contrast as long as one or both of the alternatives are
true. Example 8.26 contains two contrasting statements made by John the Baptist. Although
the statements are antithetical, both are true. Contrasts with 0 usually occur
intersententially, rather than intrasententially.

8.4 CONJOINED BASES REALISING ADVERSATIVE OR CONCESSIVE RELATIONSlll P S:
         A VA, A VA TA
   The conjunctions ava 'but (that, contrastive focus)' and avala 'but, conversely, even
                                                          ,
though, although (that, contrastive focus, frustrative) encode contrast of all types,
including oppositions where only one of the statements is true. In 8.27, only the underlined
base following avala conveys what really happened.
8.27       ... oka fo-a                      deder-ur-ari                jufu-se      diti

          I ' d fully awake (lit. open my eyes). I would wake up but (instead), I was
          nodding off to sleep . . . '
   Both ava and avala contain va which signals a change of direction or contraexpectation.
Example 8.2 is repeated below as 8.28. Here, avala indicates that the men's treatment of
Soboko is contrary to the norm in Korafe society. The sentence arrangement is paratactic,
with the avala linked intonationally with the second base.
8.28      Soboko=mo           evetu=ri,           avala            gegenembo nu
          Soboko=T1F          woman=COP.AQ.       that.CT.FRUS men.RED       3S

          believe.I-SEQ.Ss+do.again.1I-DP.3PL.AQ
          'Soboko was a woman, but the men trusted her repeatedly. '
   I n 8.29 avala occurs i n the same rhythm group as the initial base. Syntactically, the two
bases are in a non-embedding hypotactic relationship. Semantically, avala encodes a
concessive ' even though' relationship between the two bases as well as the protagonist's
frustration.

   The avata marks contrast more strongly than ava, or else it indicates a much greater
degree of frustration. The free translations of the examples in 8.3 0a and b illustrate this
difference.

      Matthiesen and Thompson ( 1 988:279-284) also distinguish embedding from hypotaxis, which they
      describe as a gramrnaticalisation of the ""nucleus-satellite relation"".

dependent final verbs that predicate dependent clauses (either in embedding or hypotactic
relationships) from independent final verbs that predicate independent clauses.
   Syntactically, modal markers (e.g. fa ' I ' m feeling frustrated', asi 'that was said') can
only cliticise to the final element of bases in paratactic or hypotactic relationships, not to
the final element of embedded constructions.
   Prosodically, sentence bases in both paratactic and hypotactic arrangements are typically
separated by a .2 to .8 second pause. In paratactic arrangements, the pause precedes the
conjunction. In hypotactic arrangements, it follows the conjunction.
   The paratactic bases in a sentence sometimes have similar frequency contours. They
tend to terminate at approximately the same frequency, sentence medially and finally,
although the sentence-medial terminus may evidence a slight upward glide. The dependent
base in a hypotactic relationship usually terminates with an upward glide, which ends at a
significantly higher frequency than the terminus of the dominant base.
   Embedded clauses or clause sequences are not separated by pauses of any significant
length (more than .2 second) from the clauses they are constituents of. Determiners (e.g.
ava and ainda) that are not followed by pauses embed clauses or clause sequences. Thus,
one rhythm group is associated with both the embedded clause with its determiner and the
matrix clause.

252     Chapter 8   With so many features defining the bond between bases in sentences, it is common to
find sentences with some paratactic and some hypotactic features. The degree of integration
between bases can be registered on a continuum5 with pure parataxis at one pole and pure
embedding at the other. Hypotactic relationships would be located at several intervals along
the continuum, depending on the degree of integration between dependent and dominant
bases.
   Example 8.5 with the conjunction avata 'but, although (lit. that, contrastive and contrary
to expectation)' illustrates how a slight change in features places similar CRSs at different
ends of the continuum. The presence of the copula in 8.5a together with the pause before
avata places it at the paratactic end of the continuum. The absence of the copula in 8.5b and
the occurrence of avata in the same rhythm group with the initial base places it closer to the
embedding pole of the continuum.

   The features present in the elicited examples in 8.6 do not indicate pure parataxis or pure
embedding. The speech-act value used for future tense forms, { -a } , does not differentiate
dependent from independent bases. However, a paratactic relationship is signalled by the
conjunction if in 8.6a, and the conjunction amo in 8 .6b indicates either a hypotactic or
embedding relationship. Here, the .3 second pause shown in the frequency and amplitude
contours in the diagrams below the example suggests that the relationship is hypotactic.","[269, 270, 271, 272]"

5.6 WHY DOES KORAFE HAVE TWO CHAINING CONSTRUCTIONS?
   The Korafe utilise chaining constructions (svcs and SRCS) to streamline their accounts
of events. Members of the Korafe community share in many common cultural routines,
which they represent in event schemata with standard sequences of lexical verbs. These
sequences may be compressed into SVCS under certain conditions. Under other conditions,
each verb in the sequence may predicate a clause in an SRC. The use of these familiar
sequences provides an automatically retrievable unit which frees both speaker and
addressee to focus on the novel aspects of the particular discourse. NPs and inflections can
be stripped from these structures because of syntactic co occurrence restrictions.
Demonstrative-based conj unctions are by and large not needed, because chaining sequences
ipso Jacto are temporally conj oined, fol lowing the iconic ordering of the events
represented. 1 2
   But why have two chaining systems, SVCS and S RCS? 1 3 Bruce ( 1 986:26) answers that
question by noting that Alamblak restricts SVCS to ""those [event sequences] which express
culturally determined commonly associated events"". He adds, ""any sequence of events may
be talked about in juxtaposed clauses [which he i llustrates with an S RC], but not every
sequence of events may be described by a serial construction."" Reesink ( 1 987: 1 44- 1 47)
concludes from his study of Usan verb sequences that ""stripped-down"" SVCS merely ""tie
two verbs mentally closer together than would be the case when these events were
expressed by full medial verbs"".
    The answer for Korafe lies somewhere in between Bruce's and Reesink's perspectives.
Korafe SVCS and SRCs certainly can be constructed using the same verbal lexemes. The
recurrent verb sequence buje base 'get, gash and puncture' with medial verb and verb stem
variations was discussed above in examples 5 .3 8 and 5 .40. The verbal sequence in 5 .47a
and b also contains close to the same sequence of verbs: ( 1 ) processing the raw material (be
it flooring or wall boards) [keve ' shave off orje 'chop'], (2) getting it [bu] , (3) coming [fu]12
       Even so-called 'simultaneous' medial verbs are positioned within the sequence according t o the iconic
       ordering of the events they represent. Overlap is rarely total in Korafe, so these events too have their
       niche on the time-line before they overlap with another event. For further discussion, see § 1 1 .2.3.
13
       Part of the answer is, of course, built into the grammar. One must use an SRC to encode a change of
       subject (excepting the apparently anomalous cases, detailed in Chapter 7). However, the use of ss
       SRCs vs. SVcs does involve the kind of choices we are treating in this section.
1 74      Chapter 5
and (4) lashing it [tendi]. However, the packaging of 5.47a differs from 5.47b. In 5.47a, two
SVCs occur with the following verbal components: keve bu fera 'they shaved (off the bark)
and brought it (lit. get-they came)' and fuge tenduduseri 'they threw (it down) and lashed
(it in place) ' . 1 4
5.47a.      . .. taima=da ofo            keve    bu [era

            , . . . in the bush they shaved off the bark of the flooring, brought it, threw it
           (onto the joists) and lashed it securely.'
Only the standardised expression bu foama 'they brought (it)' is an SVC in example 5 .47b;
all the other verbs have medial or final forms. Nevertheless, the sequence involving
processing of materials and using them in housebuilding is common to both examples.
5.47b.      ... ne yavarara     je-do                      bu fo-ama                bauva

            , . . . they repeatedly chopped down yavarara wood for boards, brought it, and
            lashed it as the walls.'
   The use of a medial verb or a verb stem is primarily a matter of staging. However,
staging decisions must reflect the realities of the situation. The switch-reference system,
using the inflected medial verbs introduced in Chapter 2, allows the speaker to specify the
temporal relationships between verbs (either overlap or sequence). SVCs do the opposite.
Because the verbal constituents of S V C S do not specify temporal borders or overlap
relationships, the events they represent can blend into a unit taking the focus off the stems
as individual events and presenting the SVC as a complex, but integrated event. I S The SRC
example in 5 .48b does not reflect the same level of event integration as the SVC in example
5.48a.
5.48a.      Nan=da ghaka          eva=i         bu feunghe                Ughi

14       The motion-orientation verbs, iri 'remain, stay, live, exist',ju ' come, be in motion' and i 'go' have
         unique status in Korafe. They obligatorily occur as medial verbs, so they can never occur svc­
         internally. Thus, the structure of Korafe generally does not permit the speaker to encode a minimal
         discourse as an S vc with the components Pawley ( 1 993: 1 1 2-1 1 4) documents for Kalam. Kalam
         hunting and gathering verb sequences regularly include the following components: � 4 carry out
         activity (e.g. killing game, cutting pandanus nuts, breaking fire wood) 4 � 4 carry out activity
         (i.e. cook and eat game or nuts, make fire), unlike 'go' and 'come' in Kalam. Because Korafe uses
         medial verbs to encode motion events, it does not usually encode mini-discourse schemas in SVcs.
IS       Li and Thompson ( 1 973:99) note the integrated unspecified nature of the Mandarin Chinese serial verb
         chaining structures, stating that the addressee must infer the nature of the temporal link (e.g.
         overlapping or consecutive) between verbs from his or her knowledge of the world and the speech-act
         context.
                                                                                      SVCs   1 75          bunununghu-sira.

          ' My canoe the sea waves took hold of, swelled over, and held, and (afterwards)
          it disintegrated.'
I would rather have been in the canoe mentioned in 5 .48b than the one in 5 .48a. In 5.48a,
the disintegration of the canoe is inextricably tied up with the destructive activity of the
waves; the canoe never makes it home. Because the action of the waves is distinguished by
the DS medial verb jighiri ' it held and ' from the destructive effect on the canoe, example
5 . 48b can be interpreted to mean that the canoe made it back to shore before it
disintegrated.
   Staging decisions reflect the cultural groupings of events. Example 5 .49a is taken from a
culture book. The medial verbs single out events that are considered individually significant
by the author, such as the commencement of the feast preparation and the building of the
trellis. Food preparation activities, making sago cakes and securing the pig are grouped
together.
5 .49a.   Kirumo    tuturo+e-do           isia+bondo           dari-do          fafara

          ' We begin feast (preparations) and put up securely a taro display trellis, and then
          we fashion sago cakes, catch and tether the pig . . . '
In many cases, the staging is a matter of the personal preference of the speaker. When
asked, Bensted Keghana affirmed that the verb stem form fofonghe ' work sago' could be
changed to the medial verb formfofonghedo in the above example. But he suggested that if
the one change were made, it would be better to change the medial verb darido 'moor' to
the stem form dari. This change would group the building of the food display trellis with
the production of sago cakes.
5 .49b.   Kirumo    tuturo+e-do           isia+ bondo          dari      fafara

          ' We begin feast (preparations),and we put up securely a taro fashion sago
          cakes, and then display trellis and we catch and tether the pig . . . '
   Thus, routine, commonplace complex events whose constituents do not need to be

events or ones that deviate from the norm by coding them in medial verb form. Most
Korafe SVCs consist of familiar collocations that signal event sequences that are routinely
linked to each other in the Korafe cultural Weltanschauung. It seems that the speaker
retrieves these collocations from his memory store 1 6 at will and plugs them in his discourse
in much the same way as he does single medial verbs.","[193, 194, 195, 196]"

     etc. in the today's past tense. Fuller details are given in §2.3 .2.4.
17   Both {-a} and {-i} may occur as the fmal speech-act value index on verb forms using the counterfactual
     paradigm. Section 2.3. 1 .3 details the use of these speech act value indices.
18   The enduring past paradigm is rare and seems to be disappearing. There is a suppletive set of endings
     beginning with -i, e.g. -ia-n-a, -ia-s-a, instead of -ua-n-a, -ua-s-a. Both refuira and refeira 'he was
     coming along' are attested, and there seems no way of ascertaining which is ' right' at this point in time.
19   The { -i} speech-act value that marks predicates in content questions occurs in the current data corpus
     only with first person forms in the hortative mood.

mood: -e for present tense, -are for future tense, -rae for customary aspect, -(t)e for today's
past tense, -aete for non-factuallcounterfactual mood, -a for near past tense, -muta for
yesterday' s past, -se for distant past, and -a for enduring past. As noted above, the hortative
is distinguished by the concurrence of -al-aol-o (positive) or -eol-eu (negative) in the initial
slot and an -e in the terminal slot.
   The initial partial in the suffix sets for DS medial verbs indicates status. An -e or -te
indicates realis status. The three sets encoding irrealis status are additionally differentiated
as future tense (-aal-ol-a), customary aspect (-eol-ea),and negative hortative mood (eol-eu).","[57, 58]"

                        CLAUSE CHAIN UNITS (TCCUs)   This chapter examines standardised ways of expressing particular types of events and
situations. It takes up the question: How are things said in Korafe?
     In a much-cited passage, Chomsky ( 1 965 :4) stated that a grammar of a language should
be a systematic description of the linguistic competence of native speakers, competence
being ""the speaker-hearer' s knowledge of the language"". Echoing this view, Radford
( 1 988:3, 27) indicates that ""a model of a native speaker's competence"" is ""a grammar that
tells us what we need to know in order to be fluent in a language"", a grammar being ""a
finite system of rules which generate . . . the infinite set of well-formed sentence-structures in
the language"". In the structuralist grammarian's view, the lexicon is part of the grammar,
lexical items being the form-meaning pairs in a language, morphemes and idioms, that are
unpredictable by the rules of grammar. I
   Pawley ( 1 985 :87-90, 1 994 : 7- 1 8, 27) argues that this ' grammar-lexicon model' presents
                                                              2
an ""impoverished account of linguistic competence"". He argues that a proper speaker
should show nativelike standards in: producing grammatical utterances, pronouncing words
and adhering to conventional intonation, stress and rhythm patterns, being able to decode
fluent speech, knowing the idiomatic way of saying things as opposed to ways that are
merely grammatical, distinguishing between standardi sed expressions and ad hoc
descriptions, and saying the right thing at the right time.
   Drawing on the work of Grace ( 1 987), Pawley proposes an alternative view of languages
as ' subject matter codes (or languages)' . A description of a subject-matter language would
    In recent years, the scope of the lexicon generativists propound has been extended from a minimalist list
    to include: ( I ) more grammatical information about individual lexemes and (2) forms that were initially
    derived by rules of morphonology and syntax, e.g. nominalisations. However, it still differs considerably
    from dictionaries that lexicographers make. Pawley ( 1 986: 1 0 1 ) lists a number of morpheme sequences
    that dictionaries like Webster 's have but grammarians would count as literal expressions, formed by
    productive processes, hence not included in their lexicons.
2
    The term 'grammar-lexicon model' is from Grace ( 1 98 1 ).
        In the 1 960s, Pawley sought to do a grammar and lexicon of Kalam, a Papuan language. Feeling
    dissatisfied both with his grammatical description and early drafts of the lexicon, he ( 1 993 : 1 03) makes
    this comment: ""My thesis . . . failed to record some of the most distinctive and quintessential
    characteristics of the language. The analysis did not give the reader much idea of how the Kalam
    actually say the kinds of things that they say. The most productive patterns for reporting events and
    situations, for instance, were not distinguished from those patterns that were grammatical but
    unidiomatic"" .","[308, 309]"

22
       Korafe follows the accessibility hierarchy Comrie and Keenan ( 1 977 : 1 56) outlines: subject>direct
       object>non-direct object>possessor. Although all unmarked core arguments may be relativised on,
       subject and direct object are the only two arguments that need not be moved. Non-direct objects must
       be y-shifted to initial position in the relative construction. Possessor is still less easy to relativise on,
       requiring a more complex syntactic arrangement that involves a possessive pronoun.
23
       The form ani is composed of the distal- I demonstrative a 'that near the addressee' and the relevancy­
       copula form ra 'relevant to the addressee' s situation' . Other related forms include re 'currently
       relevant' , ere 'this, currently relevant' , are 'that, currently relevant' , and ri 'realis copula' .

   When ara follows the noun being relativised on, the head is external to the postnominal
relative construction. The speaker uses the ara construction to provide enough information
for the addressee to identify the referent involved in the event being discussed. In 8. 78b, the
speaker uses the ara clause to restrict the referent of the faragho ' stick' to the one lying
near the addressee.
8 .78b.     Faragho,       ara                   fas+ir-ira                aimi,           sino

            hit.I-TP.3S .AQ
            ' It' s that stick, I mean the one lying over there, that I used to hit the dog.'
   Example 8.79a answers the addressee' s question: 'what happened to the canoe I took?'
8.79a.      Ara                      ghasemo bu-do            i-sesa               amo,

            smash.I-YP.3S .AQ
            ' (You ask about) that canoe that you took, well, it got smashed. '
In 8 . 79b, the ara construction functions similarly to a restrictive relative clause that
provides additional information so that the addressee can identify which canoe is being
discussed.
8.79b.      Ghasemo, ara                         bu-do         i-sesa               amo,

            ' The canoe, as a matter of fact that one that you took, (is the one that) got
            smashed. '
   Oblique arguments lose their marking and are fronted when they become the head nouns
in ara relative constructions. In example 8 .80, the unmarked head noun complex bougu
begaiya ' large village ' has a locative relationship with sirorusena 'I was born' which
predicates the relative clause. It is understood to be the referent of the obj ect of sosighi
usira in the main clause.

8 . 1 2 REMARKS ON INTERSENTENTIAL CONNECTIVES
    Sentences are either juxtaposed, or they are linked ( 1 ) by recapitulation of the terminal
verb or (2) by virtually the same set of connectives that link internal bases in CRSs.
Differentiating sequences of sentence-internal bases from sequences of sentences is not
                                                                                         2
always straightforward, when the bases or sentences are in a paratactic relationship. 4 The
frequency contours exhibited by bases and sentences in paratactic relationship are similar.
Each contour manifests a glide down to a low pitch shortly before or at its terminus.
However, sentence-internal paratactic bases sometimes manifest a slight glide upwards
following the downglide. The final syllable or two in a sentence is often devoiced; the final
syllable in sentence-internal paratactic bases is never devoiced. A less reliable guide is the
length of pauses. Intrasentential pauses average between .6 to .7 of a second. Intersentential
pauses average between 1 .0 and 1 .2 seconds in the sample taken. However, the averages are
slightly skewed by long pauses after thematic NPs and recapitulating clauses sentence­
initially that can be over two seconds long.
   Most intrasentential conj unctions function as intersentential conj unctions also,
particularly when the sentences being linked are already compound (paratactically linked)
or complex sentences. Conj unctions which occur sentence-initially mark significant points
in the speaker' s or writer's argumentation. Therefore, Korafe conjunctions which
communicate the reason for current results, i.e. ava sedo, ainda beka mo, ainda susu mo
and ainda tuka mo often occur sentence-initially.
   Three conj unctions in Korafe always mark significant points in the argumentation and
are used to l ink sentences only : an additive specifier n u ' that is speci fically ' ; a
circumstantial cause-effect conj unction avo gido ' seeing that crucial point ' ; and a
result-reason conjunction ai resira amo 'that is to say ' .
   The proposition specifier n u has the same form as the third person singular pronoun. The
speaker selects the most significant item of information from the information at his or her
disposal to elaborate on or to explain the previous point. In example 8.8 1 , the writer gives
the specific reason they dig pits on paths into the garden.","[303, 304, 305]"

2.3 FINITE VERB FORMS-THE SUFFIX SETS
   Korafe finite verbs are either final verbs or different-subject medial verbs. They are
inflected by three-part suffix sets that indicate the following categories: ( 1 ) tense-aspect­
mood/status distinctions, (2) person and number of subject and (3) speech act value. The
final verb suffix sets are given in Table 2.3. Although the recurrent partials constituting the
suffix sets are for the most part isolable, the third person singular forms are not. Another
difficulty in segment interpretation arises in the hortative forms; the hortative mood suffix
sets are encoded by the concurrence of specific initial and terminal partials. Therefore,
these partials are outlined in their respective ' slots' in this section and then treated as
composite or portmanteau suffixes in interlinear segmentation for the rest of this book.
     In Table 2.3, where there are two sets of forms in the column, the initial set ending in
{ -a} is the dependent final set, and the second set ending in {-i} is used with content
questions and some assertions. The set used in a particular tense for indicative is indicated
by an asterisk ( * ) , following the suffix form.",[56]

     source of new vocabulary items. Some examples are: masisi ' matches' , sikuru 'school', sisima
      'steamer', maketa e 'sell (lit. market do)' and yus(i) e 'use'. The English numeral system is preferred;
     Korafe numbers above 20 are rarely used. Even English grammatical patterns have an influence on
     Korafe. Inanimate nouns are not marked for plurality. Nevertheless, the collective word mane (which,
     for the Korafe, is equivalent to the English {-s}) is used orally and in written texts in combinations like
     jighomane 'pick combs' and kambomane 'houses' .

      unlum              lUi             [li]17   In Farr and Farr ( 1 974:8-9), nasal consonants (both nasals and prenasalised p losives) were said to
     condition nasalised vowels, which were viewed as allophones of oral vowels. Neutralisation of contrast
     between voiced plosives and voiced pre-nasalised plosives was said to occur following a syllable with a
     nasal onset and a processually nasalised vowel.
     However, non-processually nasalised vowels also occur in quite a number of Korafe words. Therefore,
     the question now is: are all pre-nasalised plosives the result of contact assimilation of voiced plosives
     with preceding nasalised vowels? The following synchronic evidence does not support a phonemic series
     of pre-nasalised plosives in Korafe.
     ( I ) When some words are partially reduplicated, the reduplicated syllable i s not prenasalised. Thus, for
           embo 'person' , the resultant form is embobo 'people', not *embomb o. Likewise, partial
           reduplication of imboti ' mother-in-law' results in imboboti ' mothers-in-law'.
     (2) Evidence from word-play games for the most part supports a nasalised vowel rather than pre­
           nasalised p losives. The word jingabu 'snake' is scrambled as b ugajin; sumbira ' he ran' is
           scrambled as birasum.
     (3 ) Unlike other languages in the Binandere family Korafe does not have word-initial pre-nasalised
           plosives:
          Mado Baruga [ m bu) ' get' (Korafe [bu)),
          Mado Baruga [ndi) 'bird' (Korafe [ci:l.k ha)), and
          Ewage [Ilga) ' canoe' (Korafe [ya.k haD.
     Thus, nasalised vowels occur unambiguously in the corpus, and pre-nasalised plosives do not. This alters
     the analysis, but does not affect the orthography.
18   Nasalised vowels are written as vowel + n before 'd', 'g ', 'j ', 'gh ' and at word breaks and as vowel + m
     before 'b '.
19   The Korafe word for 'and' is written as ii, a compromise that accommodates both those speakers who do
     pronounce it as nasalised and those who do not.
14     Chapter 1   Vowel iength 20 is phonemic and is written as VV. Heterogeneous vowel sequences occur
as bimoric complex nuclei in syllable rhymes. The oral set includes all possible
combinations but 'uo'. The nasal set is limited, with only the second vowel being nasalised
in several cases: 'iii', ' ill , 'ei' , ""eu' 'ai' '01' , and 'ui' . A few words exhibit lengthened
vowels occurring in heterogeneous vowel sequences as complex V1V2V 2 nuclei in a syllable
(e.g. aii 'yes', kiuun 'sneeze').
     Korafe has the following syllable patterns: v, CV, VV, CVV, VVV, CVVV.
   Korafe words are stress-timed, with longer words pronounced in approximately the same
time as shorter words. Primary stress within a word is associated with a 'heavy' syllable, a
syllable which is uttered for a longer duration than the other syllables in the word. For
instance, a spectograph of an utterance of beka ['beg.kh a] 'mouth' indicates that [beg] was
uttered for 2.29 seconds and [kh a] for 1.69 seconds. In a similar word biM [big.'kh a]
'sister-in-law' receiving stress on its second syllable, [big] was uttered for 1.36 seconds and
[kh a] for 2.29 seconds. A heavy syllable may also manifest increased amplitude and a
higher pitch.
   Stress is predictable for most of the words in Korafe. Non-verbs and verb stems manifest
word stress on: (1) the initial syllable of words with two syllables (2) the second syllable of
words with more than two syllables, or (3) the first (c)vv(v) syllable (when this pattern
occurs). In inflected verb forms, 2 1 stress falls on the initial vowel of vowel-initial suffixes
following either the verb stem or an imperfective morpheme when one occurs in post-stem
position. When an imperfective morpheme is not present and the suffix begins with a
consonant, stress falls on the stem vowel or the classificatory vowel. Where stress is not
predictable, an acute C) accent is written over the most sonorous vowel in the stressed
syllable.
   Some basic Korafe intonation contours are illustrated in Chapter 4. More detailed
information on allophonic variation, phonotactics, and other aspects of Korafe phonology is
given in FaIT and FaIT ( 1974: 5-38).","[32, 33, 34]"

8.9.2 INDIRECT QUOTES
   Indirect quotes usually have two components : the indirect quote and the speech-act
formula.
   Indirect quote constructions are differentiated into four structural types by their word
order, their intonational pattern, the type of predicating constituent and by the
complementiser that embeds them. In only one of the types is the indirect quotation
phonologically separate from the speech-act base. Usually it is the dependent base in
hypotactic relationship with the speech-act base. The other three embed as complements in
the dominant or matrix clause and have the following structures: ( 1 ) the indirect quote
terminates with a positive deverbal form followed by a, va, or ava that embeds them, (2)
the indirect quote is a purpose construction embedded by dae in a matrix clause with a form
of se ' say ', and (3) the indirect quote either is a topic-comment clause without the copula
or it terminates with a final dependent verb followed by va or a demonstrative form, and is
phonologically linked to the speech-act formula. (A fuller explanation of the deverbal and
purpose construction types is found in § 3 . 1 .6. l and §7.2.2.)
   In example 8.66 an indirect quote that is an embedded complement is contrasted with an
indirect quote that is not embedded within the speech-act clause. In 8.66a two speech­
act/mental-process bases bracket the indirect quote uvu kafuruva 'the water was deep
water', which is an object complement of the verb setira 'he said' . The complementiser va
signals that the indirect quote (topic-comment structure) is not true.
8.66a.     Nu kate-tira            amo,       uvu         kafuru=va   se-tira.
           3S think.I-TP.3S.FN that.TIF water deep.water=CT say.I-TP .3S.FN
           ' He thought that the water was deep. (And it wasn't.)'
The indirect quote in example 8.66b is phonologically separate from the speech act base.
This quote gives true information.
                                                                                      eRSs   2798.66b.     Nu kote-tira            amo,       uvu   kafuru=ri.
           3S think.I-TP.3S.FN that.TIF water deep.water=coP.AQ
           ' He thought that the water was deep. (And it was.)'
   When the indirect quote precedes the speech-act formula, it is quite often embedded as
the object complement of the speech-act or mental-process verb. However, in example
8.67, the indirect quote comprises a sentence base that is phonologically separate from the
sentence base that contains the mental process.
8 .67

         I S NEG knowledge+not.do=cOP.AQ
        , . . . where I left the canoe, I did not know. '
Pronominal reference in indirect quotes mirrors the external context of the discourse. As
8.67 shows, the narrator uses first person pronouns for self-reference : na ' I ' in the speech
act/mental process base and first person singular marking on dotutusena 'I left ' .
   Second person forms are used for those that the narrator i s addressing. All discourse­
internal participants are referenced by third person pronouns. The second person genitive
pronoun in the indirect quote of example 8.68 refers to the person the narrator i s
addressing. The third person pronoun references the discourse-internal speaker.

         son will come tomorrow.)'
8. 1 0 SENTENTIAL COMPLEMENTS IN CRSs
   Sentential complements that occur in CRSs have theme function in the sentence. Unlike
many complements, they are not embedded in the independent terminal base, but they
occur as a dependent initial base that is phonologically distinct from and in hypotactic
relationship with the terminal base. The complement is predicated by a dependent final
verb, which is usually followed by a demonstrative.
  Korafe complements encode : ( 1 ) indirect quotations or mental processes, (2)
evaluations, (3) final cause (or purpose) and (4) habitual acts. Embedded complements that
express evaluations or habitual acts are discussed in §3 . 1 .6. 1 . Section 7.2 gives
complements that encode purpose. Section 8.9.2 describes and illustrates indirect quotes.
  This section illustrates complements in CRSs that encode evaluation. As examples 8 .69
and 8.70 illustrate, amo 'that' is usually the demonstrative complementiser for sentential
complements in evaluations.
280     Chapter 88.69    Nu i-sira                    amo,     eveva=ri.
         3S go.DUR-DP.3S .FN that.T/F good=COP.AQ
         ' That he went away is good.' (He was a bad influence in our community.)
     In 8.70 the initial thematic complement contains two alternative bases. The second

      Reesink ( 1 987: 1 82- 1 88) discusses gapping i n Usan, also a Papuan language. Characterised by an SOY

   The NPs manifesting subject and object in the first clause are usually more complex than
those manifesting the same constituents in the second clause. In example 6.47, the subject

6.2.6 CONJOINING BETWEEN SRCs BY RECAPITULATION
   The occurrence of a final verb terminating an SRC within a longer discourse signals the
end of a sequence of integrated actions. It often sigrials also a break in iconic ordering. In
order to resume the iconically ordered narrative or procedural explanation of the previous
SRC, the speaker repeats or paraphrases a terminal portion of that SRC. This recapitulation,16     The fJ symbol i n examples in this section replaces the gapped medial verb.
204      Chapter 6often termed 'tail-head linkage' , 1 7 may be accomplished by repeating the same verb that is
the ' tail' in the first sentence as the initial predicate (the ' head') of the second sentence.
This lexical overlapping is illustrated by the underlined verbs ( itira. Itido) at the sentence
juncture in example 6.48.
6.48      ... nunda bayau=ghae             it-ira.         Iti-do . . .
               3S .GEN goOd=COM.DU cook.I-TP.3S .FN cook.I-SEQ.SS
          ' . . . she cooked it with her food. Having cooked it . . . '
Recapitulation is not always limited to repeating the terminal verb in medial form. The
verbs in the svc terminating the initial sentence in example 6.49 are recapitulated by an
SVC that terminates with a dependent final verb.
6.49      ... sumbu         buv-eni.               Sumbu             buv-ena . . .
               run.NDUR arrive.NDuR-TP. I S .AQ run.NDUR arrive.NDUR-TP . I S.FN
          ' . . . running, I arrived. Having run and arrived . . . '
The lexical verb (se ' say' ) in an aspect-encoding clause complex is the repeated segment in
example 6.50; the grammatical aspect-marking verb is not used in the recapitulation.
6.50      ""Aki=mane,       reighi tefo+tafo =ri, ""   se-do        ghe-tira.
           older.sister=PL place nothing+RDuP=COP.AQ say.I-sEQ.SS do.again.I-TP.3S .FN
          S-eari . . .
          say.I-SEQ.IR.CUST.3S .DS
          ""'Older sisters, (this) place (has) nobody at all"", she would habitually say. She
          would say (that and) . . . '
The narrator may summarise the event encoded in the 'tail ' using a generic verb in the
'head' . Commonly used generic verbs in Korafe are e 'do' and aminge 'do that way ' .
6. 5 1    ... ungo ata     de-do      jojore-ge-teri.               E-tero

         see.J-SEQ.SS
         ' . . . they beat and bent their arms and legs. They did (that), and seeing (that) . . . '
Sometimes an NP is also included in the recapitulating segment. In 6.52 the pronoun nu '3S '
is included in the recapitulating clause .
6.52      .. .fumb-ari=dae              e-do         amb-ira.         Nu ambu-do . . .

17       Thunnan ( 1 975 :342-343) borrows from Loos ( 1 963) the tenn linkage to describe the phenomenon of
         lexical overlap at sentence junctures.

"20   Four relative pitch levels, used to explain intonation contours in English, are helpful in the auditory
     analysis of intonation contours in other languages (Pike 1 945 :25-26). These can be labelled extra-high,
     high, mid, and low respectively and can be numbered /' 1 for low pitch, 121 for mid-pitch, III for high
     pitch, and 141 for extra-high pitch, following Trager ( 1 972: 84).
21   Pike ( 1 945 :24) discovered that ""there are many more contours than one for question and one for
     statement"". Because of his findings, he abandoned a grammatical or lexical definition of intonation
     contours in English, preferring to defme them ""in terms of attitudes of the speakers"".
  1 44          Chapter 4    Korafe statements manifest a variety of intonation contours. The only predictable
 intonation contour is the final one, which is a (3- 1 ) or (2- 1 ) downglide that frequently
 terminates with devoicing of the final vowel or syllable(s). For all but example 4. 1 02, the
 fundamental frequency range in declarative examples is 80- 1 801 1 90 Hz. All of the
 examples terminate at 1 00 Hz or below. Example 4.99 is a declarative sentence filled by a
 topic comment clause.
 4.99            Na eva joka o =in=da                 evetu=ri.
                 I S ocean inside that.D2=CEFF=GEN woman=COP.AQ
                 'I am a sea-dwelling woman, belonging there. '
   The amplitude and frequency curves below reflect Bensted Keghana's interpretation of
example 4.99. The utterance is 2.946 seconds long. The topic na 'I' is the longest syllable
(39 1 milliseconds). The loudest syllable at 63.9 (-39dB) is e in eva 'sea' . The syllable ka in
joka has the highest pitch ( 1 73 . 1 Hz). The most accented syllable is e in e va, with the
greatest amplitude and the second highest pitch ( l 7 1 .8Hz). This correlates with the purpose
of this sentence: to emphasise that the addressee's brother was responsible for removing the
speaker from her home environment, the ocean (eva). The final syllable ri is very low in
pitch (87.7 Hz) and amplitude (2.6 (-3 1 .7dB)).","[163, 164]"
"
 16    The question then arises: are all svcs lexemes? Or is there more to being a lexeme than being a unit in
       the memory? As §5.4 points out, not all SVcs have the full set of characteristics of lexemes, in spite of
       the fact that they may be memorised units. We' ll return to this question in Chapter 9.

construction is a chaining construction consisting of two or more clauses (or bases). The
terminal clause in an SRC is headed by a single final verb or an SVC that terminates with a
final verb, which is preceded by one or more clauses, each headed by a single medial verb
or an S VC that terminates with a medial verb. Example 6 . 1 is an SRC with six bases,
annotated (a-f), the first five terminating in medial verbs, the last consisting of a final verb.

   A s described in Chapter 2 , a final verb i s a finite verb form inflected for absolute tense,
aspect, mood, person and number of subject, and speech-act value. It is the only verb in the
SRC chain that is grounded temporally and modally in the speech-act situation. It is often
syntactically independent.
   Unlike verb stems in SVCs, medial verbs are inflected verb forms. They specify temporal
and referential (in terms of identity or non-identity of subject reference) relationships which
hold between two clauses: the ' marking clause' that the medial verb predicates and the next
clause, which is called its ' reference clause' . 1 Each medial verb within an SRC has its own
          In Korafe, the reference clause obligatorily follows the marking clause, except in constructions
          involving purpose and other embedded constructions.
             As mentioned in Chapter 2, the terms marking clause and reference clause are used by Haiman and
          Munro ( 1 983:xii). Others (Comrie 1 983:23; Stirling 1 993 :4; Roberts 1 988b:49) use the term
          controlling clause rather than reference clause.
             I prefer the term reference clause to the term controlling clause, which implies that the marking
          clause is subordinate to the controlling clause. Verbs agree with their subject NP in person and/or
          number; they do not control it. In the same way, the switch-reference system monitors the
          coreferentiality status existent between marking clause and reference clause and indicates it by '""
          or overt marking. The reference clause does not control the marking clause, as cases of referential
          overlap and ' apparently anomalous' switch-reference illustrate. These cases are discussed in
          Chapter 7.","[196, 197]"
"
12    According to Longacre (1 972:68-69, 90-9 1), ""natural languages contain in their lexical structure certain
       Expectancy Chains. An Expectancy Chain may involve (i) a succession of actions which customarily
       follow each other in chronological order; (ii) an intent to act plus the action itself; (iii) an obligation to
      act plus the action; or (iv) the ability to act plus the action ... around the world, we find Expectancy
      Chains which involve successive actions such as: 'leave (someplace). .. go. . . arrive '; 'search. . .find';
        'waste away. . . die '; fall down. . . smash. ...
                                                        '
           Expectancy Chains which involve Succession with different actors are such as the following:
        'shoot... die '; 'hit.. . die '; 'call... answer... '; 'give (to someone) ... appreciate '; give (to someone) ... cook (it) '.
       Although most of his examples are paired collocations, Longacre does not clearly differentiate paired
       clause sequences from scripts. (See discussion of scripts in Chapter 1 0.) And two of his multimembered
      expectancy chains definitely correspond more closely to scripts: 'go with hooks... tie hooks. . . catch
      fish. . . bringfish. .. eat ' and 'cook in leaves.. .put into container... bring to the canoe... come down '.
           The standardised clause sequences described in this chapter, for the most part, contain two verbs.
       They are lexically, grammatically, and phonologically constrained. Korafe scripts often involve more
      than two verbs. Although the verbs in Korafe scripts are lexically constrained, the definition of scripts
       does not involve grammatical or phonological constraints.
                                                       Standardised verb sequences and TCCUs   303  In 9. 1 6a a clause sequence encoding continuous aspect, jofughuse iri 'remain
swallowing', is negated as a unit.
9. 1 6a. Nu uvu jo         jofughu-s'+ir-ae=ri.
         3S water NEG swallow.I I-SIM.SS+remain-not.do=COP.AQ
         ' He wasn't continually swallowing water. '
Examples 9. 1 6b and 9. l 6c are ungrammatical because the negative focus marker j 0
intervenes between V I and V2 . It should occur only preceding V I .
9. 1 6b. *Nu uvu jofughu-se           jo  ir-ae=ri.
          3S water swallow. Il-SIM.SS NEG remain-no.do=COP.AQ

           3S water NEG swallow. II-SIM.SS NEG remain-no.do=COP.AQ
  Non-standardised sequences of medial verbs do occur with the structures found in 9. l 6b
and 9. 1 6c. (Refer to §6.2 . 3 .) It should be noted that the structure found in 9. 1 6c is
permissible with those standardi sed c lause sequences that are not grammatically
constrained, as 9. 1 7 shows.
9. 1 7   Nu, jQ    namane s-aoro                  jQ      siror-ae =ri.
         3S NEG I PL.EXC say.-SEQ. lR. I PL.DS NEG be.born-not.do=cOP.AQ
         ' Regarding him, it wasn't we that caused him to be born, not at all . '
   When these sequences are negated, a discrepancy between their syntax and semantics
occasionally occurs. Syntactically, the negative focus marker jo must precede V I and V2
must be marked by ae. However, in these cases the semantics of the situation indicate that,
while the event represented by V I did not happen, the event represented by V2 did. In (9. 1 8)
the initial clause contains the negative focus marker and its verb is marked irrealis, and the
second predication has the negative deverbal along with the copula.
9. 1 8   Jo    nune    genembo jigh-ari                  amb-ae=ri.
         NEG 3S.ACT man              hold.l-SEQ.IR.3S.DS die .I-not.do=COP.AQ
         ' It wasn't he that killed the man.'
In reality, the first event is the one that did not happen, but a death actually did occur. The
one accused did not perform the sorcery, but the man did die.
   In standardised clause sequences such as the one in 9. 1 8, the speaker must must make V I
a final verb if he or she wants to negate one verbal constituent without negating the other,
as example 9. 1 9 illustrates.
9. 1 9   Nu genembo kae+jigh-ira,                avata            jQ      amb-ae=ri.

3 .2.3 PRAGMATIC FUNCTIONS
   The speaker assigns pragmatic functions to NPs in order to communicate his or her
viewpoint to addressees. This NP denotes the topic to be discussed, the salient focal
information which addressees are meant to assimilate, a significant contrast between
entities, or the focus of the speaker's empathy. Unlike NPs marked for semantic roles which
relate to one predicate at the clausal level, N Ps encoding pragmatic functions often21
        The i occurs before the postpositions da (genitive), ghae, de, dae and kena ainda 'of that',
        ainghae/ainde 'with that', aindae ' because of that', and aikena ' in that direction' . The mi is placed
        before da (locative) and go: aminda 'there', amingo 'like that'.
94     Chapter 3reference entities that extend their scope of influence beyond the clause. Some even are
discourse themes.
   Three types of speech-packaging devices are used by Korafe speakers in oral and written
texts : ( 1 ) word order, (2) postpositions and other syntactic markers (including
demonstratives, interrogative-indefinites, and focal pronouns) (3) phonological features.
   Pragmatic functions are highlighted phonologically by accent, stress, p a u s e s and
intonation contours. (See fn.S in this chapter re definitions of accent and stress.) Accent
and stress are used to indicate the focused element in the clause or in the intonation
contour. Accent (or heavy stress) is manifested by increased intensity (amplitude) and/or a
higher pitch on the inherently stressed syllable of the word that receives the main focus of
the segment that correlates with the intonation contour. Accent within the intonational
contour is symbolised below by a double-underlined single quote ( : ). Stress perturbs from
the antepenultimate syllable to the penultimate syllable of future verb suffixes to shift the
focus from the verb to another element in the clause. Examples 3 .93a and b illustrate the
combination of accent and stress to mark the focused unit in two clauses. In 3 . 93a, the
focus is on the verb and the action of going.
                           FOCUS
3 .93a. Na sifo=de        J!:.!jrena.
         1 S day=COM.D gO.DUR-F. I S.FN
         ' I will go tomorrow. (I am definitely going tomorrow, no two ways about it.)'
In example 3 .93b, the focus is on the argument preceding the verb, as indicated by both
accent and perturbed stress on the verb.
           FOCUS
3 .93b. Na s'.(g =de      y-arena.
         I S day=COM.D go.DUR-F. I S.FN
         'I will go tomorrow. (You thought I'd already gone. No, I ' ll be going tomorrow.)'
   Pauses separate the external or pragmatic functions of theme and tail from the main
sentence base(s). Pauses are signalled by punctuation marks such as commas and full stops
in written texts. For examples with themes and tails, see §3.2.3 . 1 . Pauses also mark rhythm
groups, which contain one or more intonation contours and are equivalent to coherent
informational units or thematic clause chain units (TCC us) in sentences. A fuller
explanation of TCCUs is given in §9.3. The intonation contours and amplitude graphs that
characterise statements, questions, and commands are illustrated in §4.7 and its subsections.
   The pragmatic functions Korafe has, the word order demonstrated by these functions and
the morphological indicators of pragmatic functions in Korafe are outlined in the following
sections: 3.2. 3 . 1 , 3 .2.3.2 and 3 . 2 . 3 . 3 .","[113, 114]"

26     It is possible that the suffix set for the Korafe future paradigm has the underlying configuration: ari 'to
       do, doing' + {-ena}, which has the surface structure: arena, aresa, etc. after the regressive vowel

     The future tense paradigm with stem II must host the exocentric imperfective morpheme
{ -uru } . The r-insertion phonological rule often occurs, as the paradigms for se 'say' and gi
' see' illustrate below:

   This future imperfective set only occurs in dependent bases in sentences within the
current language corpus. The event encoded by the verb it marks overlaps in some way
with another event, as in example 2.65, whereas in example 2.66 the action of the stem 1

2.4.8 CUSTOMARY ASPECT: STEM 1 + { -RAENA }
   Korafe has two constructions that indicate generic/customary and habitual activities,
sentence- or proposition-finally: the customary paradigm and the sporadic iteration clause
complex that is used to encode habitual aspect, described in §9.2.4. 1 .2 . The customary
paradigm has the following independent and dependent forms :
        Person          ' say'             'enter'           'see'            'write'
        IS              se-raena           tere-raena        gi-raena         gembu-raena
        2S              se-raesa           tere-raesa        gi-raesa         gembu-raesa
        3S              se-raira           tere-raira        gi-raira         gembu-raira
        1/3PL           se-raera           tere-raera        gi-raera         gembu-raera
        2PL             se-raeva           tere-raeva        gi-raeva         gembu-raeva
   The customary forms do not refer to any specific instance of an event, but rather to its
prototypical characterisation. As such, they are not bound to any specific time period, such
                                                                                       Korafe verbs    49as future or today' s past. In example 2.67, the customary form gamburaira occurs sentence­
finally in a referencing medial verb clause chain, describing what mosquitoes always do.

1 54   Chapter 5(3) The temporal relationships (i.e. sequencing and overlap relationships) between the
    verbs are not overtly expressed by their structure, as they are by the medial verbs in
    switch-reference constructions (SRCS).
(4) Only the terminal verb is inflected, but the scope of its inflection (which includes tense,
    aspect, mood, subject marking and speech-act value) extends over all the verbs in the
    series.
(5) All verbal constituents encode events in which at least one of the referents, usually the
    one realised as subj ect, is ' shared' . (The default value for subject referent for the series
    is assumed to be the one marked on the terminal verb.) In addition to its direct coding
    on the verb, the subject NP is sometimes referenced by an overt NP.
(6) Nominal + verb combinations (see §2.6) are regarded as a verbal unit, distributionally
    equivalent to single verb constituents of the SVC.
(7) Verbal constituents cannot be embedded by demonstratives and/or postpositions as a
    complement of another verb in the series.
(8) Modal particles (e.g. are, asi, la, (ano, ai), indicating the speaker' s outlook on an event,
    cannot follow bare verb stems.
(9) SVCs encode events. The term ' event' is used without a modifier to refer to ' conceptual
    event' throughout the rest of this work. According to Pawley ( 1 98 7 : 3 3 5-3 3 6),
    conceptual events are ""the meaning of a clause, containing . . . a kind of action,
    conceptually simple or complex."" ! It has been noted (Lord 1 974: 1 96- 1 97; Bradshaw
    1 982:28; Foley and Olson 1 985 : 1 8-22; Sebba 1 987:2 1 2; Givan 1 990b:23,48; Durie
    1 992:2) that each verb in an SVC can often be considered to express a subpart or aspect
    of a single overall event, which correlates closely with a complex or episodic event, as
    defined by Pawley ?
   Two basic structural types of SVCs can be distinguished in Korafe:3 ( 1 ) contiguous SVcs
and (2) non-contiguous SVcs. Contiguous SVcs minimally consist of an uninterrupted
sequence of two or more verbs. This contiguous set of verbs follows any nominals and       In his taxonomy of conceptual events, Pawley lists: ( I ) simple single actions, (2) episodic ""sequences
       of more or less separate acts"", or (3) complex events, which lie ""between simple and episodic events
       occupying various points on a scale of complexity"". Examples of simple events given by Pawley are:
       Bill released the -rope; John winked; Mary gave me a slap in the lace. The following sentences
       exemplify episodic events: Mary painted a landscape; Bill built his own house. These examples from
       Pawley typify complex events: Bill hit a bal/ through the window; Fido is letching his stick; Mary 's
       words made me angry.
          Pawley also lists generic events and events specified for temporal and spatial settings in his
       taxonomy.
2
       Pawley (personal communication) notes that an event does not necessarily have an objective unity
       outside of the speaker's decision to depict it as such.
3      Foley and Olson ( 1 985:57) and Lane and Pawley ( 1 992:4) have also documented a binary split
       between more closely-knit and more loosely-knit SVcs. Foley and Olson defme ( I ) nuclear and (2)
       core serialisation of predicates in svcs, based on a layered conceptualisation of clause structure.
       Predicates joined at the nuclear layer are juxtaposed. They share all arguments as well as tense,
       polarity, modality, mood, and illocutionary force and must be under one intonational contour.
       Predicates joined at the core level also share all peripheral arguments, tense, polarity, modality, mood,
       and illocutionary force, but they share only one core argument, which may intervene between verbal
       constituents.
          Pawley and Lane differentiate two SVC types for Kalam: simple SVCS and multiscene SVCs.
                                                                                    SVCs    1 55modifiers present in the construction. Non-contiguous SVcs allow nominals and modifiers
to intervene between any two verbs in an SVC.
  The term ' serial verb sequence ' (SVs) is also used to refer to the sequence of verbs,
whether contiguous or not, as opposed to the entire SVC.
   The main questions that attach to the analysis of SVCS in Korafe (and other languages)
are : ( 1 ) are some or all SVCS analysed as a single clause, as a reduced clause sequence, or
something different from the notions, clause or clause sequence? (2) Are SVSs not only
single predicates (if the single clause analysis is chosen), but single lexemes? (3) If entered
in the dictionary, how do we describe the role assignment of SVcs? These questions will be
taken up in detail in a later section.","[173, 174, 175]"

        simultaneous with all the past tenses, general past yielding sequential relationships between the
        marked clause and the reference clause, future with future tense, and habitual aspect with
        habitual/customary fmal verbs. Korafe and Binandere medial verbs terminate in -0 (-i for third person
        singular). Suena (Wilson 1 974:42-49) also restricts the 'tenses' that may occur in medial position, but
        the Suena medial verbs have exactly the same form as the final verbs.

   Unlike Suena medial verbs, Korafe DS medial forms exhibit a difference between their
terminal vowel (-0 (-i for 3S» 1 0 and the terminal vowels used in the final verb sets (-a for
non-past sets, -i for past sets (-u for 2PL and -a for 3 S» . Although Korafe DS medial forms
are not as transparently similar to the final forms as Suena ones are, the form still appears
as if it is the today' s past paradigm that is interpreted in a relative sense and used medially.
Just as the today ' s past tense directly precedes the speech-act moment and is limited in
duration, so the similarly marked medial verb signals an event that precedes that of the
following verb and is not durative. The DS medial form muteno ' I gave and . . . ' corresponds
to muteni ' I gave' (today' s past form for final independent verbs) and mutena ' I gave' (for
final dependent verbs).
   L ikewise present tense final verb forms appear to be used as the basis for DS
simultaneous realis medial forms to signal temporal overlap between marking and reference
clauses. The full present tense form pupinona ' I am getting' in Suena appears to be used as
the medial form as well. The Korafe DS simultaneous medial forms (e.g. rur-eno ' while 1
am/was getting' ) lack the imperfective morpheme {ere} and differ in final vowel from the
present tense final form ere-rur-ena ' I am getting' .

          ' While 1 was getting my spear, the pig went (away). (today)'10       This distinction may shed some light on the development of the Korafe medial verb forms. Haiman
         ( 1 983 : 1 26) suggests that DS forms in some languages arose from a combination of the VERB + PERSON,
         yielding a subordinate verb form that is indifferent to switch-reference, to which was added either a
         nominaliser or a conjunction. (Korafe still has a few sets of medial verbs that are homophonous with
         the dependent final verb forms: the same-subject sequencing realis durative [span] verb forms.) Korafe
         speakers index switch of subject reference by adding a final -0 post-verbally to the 'tense' forms that
         are used to convey real is or irrealis correspondences. Possible sources of this -0 are the distal
         demonstrative 'that, away from speaker and hearer' or the disjunctive conjunction 0 'or', used in polar
         questions and other bi-polar alternations. The Korafe demonstrative 0 is a nominaliser, and the
         disjunctive 0 is a conjunction. Clauses embedded by demonstrative topic markers function as
         arguments in the subsequent clause, but medial verb clauses do not function as arguments of
         subsequent reference clauses. Therefore, one can hypothesise that it was probably the disjunctive
         conjunction 0 'or' that became the signal of switch-reference, because it was used so regularly with
         the dependent final verb that fusion has eventuated. It seems appropriate to indicate discontinuity of
         subject with a disjunctive conjunction.

   The immediate future or hortative paradigm is used to indicate events that directly
follow the speech-act moment and precede the ' normal ' future tense. The related DS
paradigm set of irrealis sequencing forms precedes final verbs in the future tense as well as
imperative, counterfactual, hortative, and positive and negative deverbal forms. As
examples 6. 1 0 and 6. 1 1 show, Suena exhibits an e vs. a distinction (potane ' let me give' vs.
potana 'I will give and . . . '), and Korafe an e vs. 0 distinction (mutone ' let me give' vs.
mutono 'I will give and . . . ').

hortative.

terminates with -0 (rather than -i or -a which would make it a final form) can occur with
final verbs having present, today's past, near past, yesterday's past, distant past, or enduring
past tense forms. Th.e abbreviations used are: OS different subject, T-A-M tense-aspect­
mood, SEQ sequencing, SIM simultaneous/overlapping, OUR durative, NOUR non-durative,
and IPF imperfective.
   The realis medial forms accord with final verbs having tense-oriented TAM suffixes.
Any OS realis medial form (other than near past forms) may occur with any realis final
verb, present or past tenses. The near past medial verb forms occur only in sequences with
fmal verbs marked for present, today ' s past and near past tenses. As for the general irrealis8
       When they are questioned, Korafe speakers declare that customary medial forms should be used with
       the customary final verb and the habitual complex terminating with a final form of ghe 'do again'. In
       practice, however, they use both the irrealis future and customary medial forms in conjunction with
       SRCs that terminate with customary or habitual verb forms.
                                                                                                  SRCs      1 85or future medial forms, they may occur with the entire set of irrealis final verbs. The DS
medial customary paradigm is restricted in its distribution to occurrence with final verbs
marked for customary aspect or verb complexes that indicate habitual aspect. The DS
negative hortative paradigm occurs only with final verbs marked for negative hortative
mood.
    All languages9 in the B inandere family except B aruga have similar tense
correspondences to those listed in Table 6.2 for Korafe. To illustrate the similarity in tense
correspondences that languages in the B inandere family exhibit, Suena tense
correspondences are compared with Korafe sets. Examples illustrating the sequencing of
events having realis status are given in 6.6 (Suena) with 6.7 (Korafe), and examples
illustrating the temporal overlap of events having no realis status in 6.8 (Suena) and 6.9
(Korafe). Irrealis sets are compared in 6.9 (Suena) and 6. 1 0 (Korafe).
   In 6.6 the Suena today' s past tense paradigm is used sentence-medially to encode a
sequencing relationship between the marking clause and the reference clause. The reference
clause is predicated by a final verb in each of the following tenses: present (6.6a), today' s
past tense (6.6b), yesterday's past (6.6c) and past (6.6d).

"These structures make use of four pragmatic functions : THEME, TOPIC, FOCUS and TA IL.
THEME and TAIL are external to the predication proper and occupy the special positions, P2
and P3 respectively. TOPIC and FOCUS are internal functions of the predication. In the
schema that Dik ( 1 979:2 1 ) proposes, the P I position is ""taken by elements from special
categories of constituents (e.g. questions words) or is used for constituents with Topic or
Focus function"" . In Korafe, when a TOPIC NP is overtly present in predications terminating
with verbs, it is always in the PI initial position in the predication. But a constituent bearing
FOC U S function may not necessarily be in the initial P I position. In the second Korafe
pragmatic structure, FOCUS is normally associated with the COMMENT constituent.
   The THEME in P2 position is external to the main clause, preceding it, phonologically
separated from it by a pause. Dik's definition of THEME dovetails with Chafe's ( 1 976:50)
definition of ' Chinese topics' : ""the topic sets a spatial, temporal, or individual framework
within which the main predication holds"".
   The TOPIC in P I position is internal to the main clause. It is ""the entity ' about' which the
predication specifies something in the given setting"" ( 1 976:50). TOPIC NPs are marked by
rno in Korafe as ""the starting point of the utterance"" (Brown and Yule 1 983 : 1 26) when no
contrast is involved and { irni} or {va} when contrast is involved.
   The THEME overlaps with the TOPIC in the type of information it conveys, but THEMEs
do not ever function as clausal subjects. Neither the THEME nor the TOPIC are required to
have selectional restrictions with the verb, but the TOPIC is sometimes the syntactic subject
of the clause. As subject, its person and number are cross-referenced by the predicating
verb. Most Korafe sentences have either a THEME or a TOPIC; some have both, but some
have only the comment element. In example 3 .94, the P2:THEME function realised by
orokoe ' nowadays', and the P I :TOPIC realised by ogha rno 'the crow' reference distinct
semantic entities. The THEME provides the temporal setting for the sentence, and the TOPIC
(ogha) has subject function in the clause in which it occurs.
3 .94 [Oroko=e, hHEME [ogha=rnohoPlc Kofure ir-ira.
       today=this       crow=T/F        Kofure remain-PRES.3S.FN
      ' [Nowadays,hHEME [crowshoPlc live at Kofure. '22    The initial pragmatic structure i s abstracted for Korafe from Dik's ( 1 978: 1 9-2 1 ) language independent
      preferred order of constituents ( UPOC) . The UPOC structure that Dik proposes has this format: P2, PI
      (v) S (V ) 0 (v), P3, in which ""s and 0 stand for the neutral or unmarked positions of Subject and
      Object. The Vs indicate the possible positions of (finite and infinite) verbs. P I , P2, and P3 indicate
      'special positions' used for special purposes, and the commas stand for breaks in the intonation"" (Dik
      1 978:2 1 ).
          It should be noted that Korafe switch-reference constructions (SRCS) can occur with large numbers
      of clauses (i.e. (TOPIC) (s) (0) v). Up to 27 have been found in one sentence. SRCS can also manifest
      more than one instance of the entire set of constituents from P2 through to p) with several clauses in
      between.
          Korafe also distinguishes a pragmatic structure centred around a verbless or copular TOPIC­
      COMMENT clause, which is represented by the second formula. The occurrence of more than two
      TOPIC-COMMENT clauses in one sentence is rare. Sentence-internal TOPIC-COMMENT clauses often
      occur without the copula.
96      Chapter 3   In example 3 .95, both P2:THEME and P l :TOPIC functions reference the same semantic
entity. Personal pronouns commonly occur in Korafe as TOPICs copying the T H E M E
constituent. The main clause in this example has TOPIC-COMMENT structure, terminating
with a copula instead of a verb.","[115, 116]"
"
9.2. 1 FIXED AND SEMIPRODUCTIVE SPEECH FORMULAS
   Fixed speech formulas (formulas that do not vary in lexical content or word order) in
Korafe are exemplified by the greeting Sifo eveva! 'Good day ! (lit. day good)' , a calque on
the English expression. Fixed formulas used for expressing gratitude are: A iyakoe!
'Thanks ! ' and A iyakoe bekti resena! ' Thank you very much! ' . The telling of a legend
begins with the fixed formula Kiki! ' Story ! ' and Kiki aghata bamba! 'tall tale ! ' concludes
them.
   Semiproductive formulas occurring with severe constraints on the variation include both
traditional greetings and farewells in Korafe. Some common greetings are given in 9. 1 3 .
9. 1 3   a. R-av-asi!             b.   Ir-esa!                 c.   Re-f-esa!
            IPF-sleep-NP.2S.AQ         remain-PRES.2S .FN           JPF-come-PRES.2S.FN
            ' You slept ! '            ' You are staying! '         ' You are coming ! '
Only second person forms are used in these greetings. They are statements, not questions or
commands, that must occur with near past tense for ravasi! 'you slept' and present tense for
the other forms. In addition to their discourse function as a greeting, they often signal the
initial discourse utterance or the initial response in a dialogue. Movements, such as the third
greeting encodes, can be SVSs encoding direction + motion, such as: Viti refesa! ' You are
coming up.' and Sembu refesa! ' You are coming across (the surface crossed is usually the
fiord)' .
  Farewells are also standardised. However, they are not statements, l iterally, but
commands. The most common farewells are:
9. 1 4   a. Anumbe-y-o!             b. Yasi-y-o!                 c. Avi-y-o!
            sit.IMP-EPEN-STEN          gO.lMP-EPEN-STEN             sleep .IMP-EPEN-STEN
            ' Sit! '                   'Go ! '                      ' Sleep ! '
         d. I            av-ase!
            go.DUR.IMP sleep-H.2S.CR
            ' Go get some sleep! '
These expressions also comprise verbs, i n this case inflected for imperative mood or verb
sequences with V I inflected for imperative and V 2 for hortative moods (see 9. 1 4d above).
All the verbs have the second person singular subject suffix. Those that terminate in -0 are
uttered at a greater amplitude than most conversational exchanges are. As with the
greetings, directional verbs can be juxtaposed with the short form of the command: Vosiyo!
(vose +iyo) ' Go down! ' and Sembiyo! (sembu+iyo) 'Go across ! '
                                                               Standardised verb sequences and TCCUs          3019.2.2 STANDARDISED CLAUSE SEQUENCES
   Standardised clause sequences used in SRCs are among the productive speech formulas
that occur in Korafe. These speech formulas denote conventional activities or grammatical
notions, such as iterative aspect or conative mood. lo They are the primary focus of this
section. They have the general structure:
       C LA U SE I : (x) V I=SSIDS + C LA U SE2 : (x) V2=INFLECTED VERB
where X stands for unspecified non-verbal material and V I is expounded by a medial verb
                                                                       II
form and V 2 by an inflected verb form, either medial or final. (Constraints on the
occurrence of (x) are given below and further discussed in §9 .2.2.2.)
   These standardised clause sequences are more closely integrated than other sequences
involving medial verbs. In addition to obeying all the restrictions that apply to SRCs, such
as tense-sequencing constraints, they are constrained by grammatical and phonological
rules which apply obligatorily to them, but optionally to other sequences involving medial
verbs. These rules include:
( 1 ) the entire sequence must be negated as a unit. If only one of the events represented is
      negated, the initial verb must be changed to a final verb, and the SRC must become a
      co-ranking structure (CRS). (See §9.2.2. 1 .)
(2) The initial clause often manifests tokens of (x) before V I . Normally, nothing intervenes
    between V I and V 2 in C I and C 2 respectively. However, sometimes tokens of (x) do
    intervene between V I and V 2 in sequences encoding generic cause-effect, change of
    location or state, transfer and the inchoative aspect. Examples of exceptional cases are
    discussed in §9.2.2.2.
(3) The entire sequence must be associated with one rhythm unit and often is associated
    with one intonation contour.","[320, 321]"
"
4.6 NEGATION OF PREDICATIONS
   Negation of predications in Korafe is usually signalled by the combination of the
negative focus marker jo 'not' and the stem I form of the terminal verb with the negative
de verbal ae 'not doing' at its terminus. The copula ri follows the negative deverbal,
indicating an event that has occurred prior to the speech-act moment, but it does not specify
any time frame (e.g. today's past, near past, etc.).
4.85   Na jo       ning-ae=ri.
       I S NEG hear.I-not.do=COP.AQ
       ' I didn't hear (what was said). '
If i t is important to link the non-occurrence of a n event to a specific time frame, the
negative deverbal precedes an appropriately inflected form of the verb e 'do', functioning
like a nominal complement to the verb e 'do ' . Example 4.86 with a today ' s past tense form
and 4.87 with a present tense form are commonly used.
4.86   Na jo      ning-ae+e-teni.
       I S NEG hear.I-not.do+dO.l-TP. I S.AQ
       'I didn't hear (what was said just now).'
4.87   Na jo      ning-ae+er-ena.
       I S NEG hear. I-not.do+IPF-do.PRES. I S.FN
       'I do not hear (what is being said).'
If the non-occurrence of an event is projected, a future form of e 'do' must follow the
deverbal.
4.88   Na jo        ning-ae+arena.               Ning-ari imboe+er-ira.
       I S NEG hear.I-not.do+do.F.I S.FN hear. I-DVB dislike+IPF-do.PRES.3S.FN
       ' I will not listen. I don't want to listen (to what I believe will be said) . '
   If the speaker wants t o focus o n the negation o f a constituent other than the verb, he or
she may place jo before that constituent. In example 4.89, it precedes the instrumental
argument.
4.89   Ghaka=mo,      jQ  asi tefo+tefo        aimi          digh-ae
       canoe=TIF      NEG vine nothing+nothing that.CEFF.TIF tie.I-not.do
       e-raera.
       dO.l-CUST. 1 PL.FN
       ' Outrigger canoes, we don't lash together with just any old vine.'
It is also possible to focus on both a non-verbal constituent and the verbal constituent as
being negated, by positioning a jo before each of the constituents. In example 4.90, the
138     Chapter 4speaker emphasises his main point that not everyone will get into heaven by marking both
isasarnbu 'each and everyone' and the verb.
4.90    Narnonde jQ      isasarnbu utu=da          jQ    y-ae +arera.
        l PL.EXC   NEG all .RED     heaven=LOC NEG go.DUR-not.do+do.F. 1 PL.FN
        'Not each and everyone of us will go to heaven.'
    In negated topic-comment clauses, the copula ri must occur with a deverbal form of iri
' remain' : irae 'not remain' . Examples 4.26a and b, 4.27b and 4.27c in §4.2. 1 illustrate this.
   The verb iri 'remain' can replace the verb e 'do' to indicate that non-accomplishment of
an event is or was or will be a continuing state of affairs.
4.9 1   Ni nange     bayau jo       it-ae+ir-esi?
        2S do.how food NEG cook.I-not.do+remain-PRES.2S.AQ
        ' How come you're just lazing around here without cooking the food?'
   The scope of negation may cover either a single predication or a sequence of
predications within SRCs. Examples illustrating the scope of negation in SRCs can be found
in §6.2.3. The scope of negation cannot extend beyond a final verb, however. Therefore all
bases in co-ranking sentences must be individually negated. In example 4.92, the verb aira
'he went' terminates the predication in the positive sentence base, and the predication in the
subsequent antithetical base is negated.
4.92    Nu nu        karnbo=da a-ira,                     avata        vikoko jQ
        3S SPEC      house=LOC go.NDUR-TP.3S.FN           that.CT.FRUS knife  NEG
        b-ae=ri.
        get. I-not.do=COP.AQ
        ' It is true that he went to the house, but he didn't get the knife.'
   As illustrated in the previous examples, predications that are statements (4.90) and
questions (4.9 1 ) are negated by jo 'not' at the onset and ae ' not do' at the terminus.
Commands are negated by using the negative hortative form of the final verb. The scope of
negation in a command can be optionally marked by placing {era} 'don't' before the initial
constituent to be negated. Examples 4.93a and b illustrate negative prohibitions without and
with {era } .
4.93a. Usu          duru=da   anurnb-eose!    Oroko           usu=i        du-do
       coconut      under=LOC sit-NEG.H.2S.CR today           coconut=CEFF fall.l-SEQ.SS
        d-arira.

        ' Don't sit underneath the coconut tree. (If you do,) a coconut will fall down and
        hit you now. '
4.93b. Usu         duru=da      era anurnb-eose!
       coconut under=LOC NEG sit-NEG.H.2S.CR
       ' Don't sit underneath the coconut tree. '
Other examples involving negative hortative forms may be found i n §2.4.2 . 1 1 , §2.S.2.6,
and §7.2.2.2.

   Korafe simple sentences are minimally composed of one base with accompanying
prosodies. 1 7 Sentence bases correspond syntactically to the clauses and semantically to the
predications outlined in this chapter, and have either P I SOY or P I :TOPIC-COMMENT
constituent structure.
   In simple sentences with P I SOY constituent structure, the verb must be an independent
final verb, and those with P I :TOPIC-COMMENT structure must terminate with the copula
(ri). The maximal constituent structure of Korafe simple sentences can be represented by
one of the following two structures:
       Periphery P2:THEME, PI SOY, P3:TA IL or
       Periphery P2:THEME, P I :TOPIC COMMENT, P3:TAIL,
where P I and P3 are NPs or PPs, not clauses.
    Modal particles that attach to the verb or the copula at the terminus of the base encode
epistemic and evaluative modalities. Epistemic particles include: asi 'that was said (quoted
speech or strongly asserted by the speaker)' , tana 'possibly' , and tanaja 'perhaps, maybe
so, maybe not'. Evaluative particles are: ta 'I, the speaker, am frustrated or annoyed', vae
'I, the speaker, am extremely annoyed to the point of anger' , { ere } 'this material is
immediately relevant to our present situation'. Example 4.94 illustrates the use of the
epistemic modal particle, asi 'that was said'.
4.94    Nundae       si-seni,            ""Fu,               nanda dengesi=da

        ' I said to him, ""Come, and dock next to me,"" that was said.
The epistemic particles tana 'possibly' and tanaja 'perhaps' convey two grades of doubt
about the situation, the former expressing more of a possibility. They are often used in
sentences in conjunction with avase 'perhaps, I just don't know (lit. that.CT.say.n)"" which
occurs as an initial peripheral segment or follows the thematic entity, as example 4.95
illustrates.","[157, 158, 159]"

   A pause-free intonation contour or rhythm group is associated with contiguous SVCs. By
contrast, non-contiguous S V c s that contain conj unctions can occur with pauses, as in
examples 5.22 and 5.23. The Korafe editors of the New Testament thought that a comma
should be placed between vose ' descend' and eva etoda to signal a pause in example 5 .24,
taken from Matthew 1 4 :29.
5.24       Peter ghaka=da ghe               vose,      eva                        eto=da fete

           ' Peter got down from the boat, stood on top of the sea and went to Jesus.'
The quotation that is itself two sentences long in example 5.25 intervenes between two
verbal constituents sosofe ' lick' and setiri ' she said' of an SVC. Punctuation marks
indicating pauses are positioned after sosofe, the vocative Fono Gimasa, the command gi
' see (about)' , and the statement ravira ' it is burning' and the terminal verb of the SVC,
setiri ' she said and' .

   Pause words enabling the speaker to regroup his or her thoughts, such as avori ' al l
right', also intervene between verbal constituents i n non-contiguous SVcs. In example 5 .26,
the speaker uses avori ' all right' in (b) to signal that he has mentioned all the events
required to precede the final activity 'eating'.

          Workshop. When Kingsley Seko edited it in February 1 992, he changed the verb stem ghaghose 'she
          chewed' to the medial form ghaghosedo 'she chewed and'. He dropped the oka gae sosofe ' (she) put
          her limestick into the lime and licked it' . In its place he put a final verb as the quote formula before the
          quote: setira 'she said', removing the quote from being embedded in an Svc.

5 . 3 NEGATIVE DEVERBALS IN SVCs
   Like final verbs, deverbals, both positive and negative, may be the final verb in chaining
structures, as example 5 . 7) above illustrates. (For an explanation of deverbals, refer to §2. 1
and its subsections and §4.6.) In these cases, the negative deverbal l inks the S VC it
terminates to the main clause. In example 5.27, the deverbal joins with the copula rio
5.27    Nunda asug-ari     eveva=go eni jo asuge
        3S .GEN clothe-DVB goOd=CPAR a NEG clothe
        fu-r-ae=ri.
        come.DUR-EPEN-not.do=cOP.AQ
        ' He didn't put on any good clothing and come.'
The whole SVC functions as a very complex nominal expression in combination with iri
' remain' or e ' do', as shown in example 5 .28.
5.28    Nengae        ambo=da jQ       okia=da         bayau iti        mind-ae+areva.
        2S.D.COM back=LOC NEG clay.pot=LOC food                  cook.l eat.I-not.do+do.F .2PL . FN
        , After (this) the two of you will not cook food in a clay pot and eat it. '
   When the negative deverbal precedes the verb stems i n an SVC, i t sometimes functions
as an adverbial form expressing manner. The deverbal forms kotae 'not thinking' , kotae
                                                                   ,
kotae ' haphazardly' and sembae 'mistakenly (lit. not crossing) have lexicalised and
standardly function like adverbs in Korafe. They can occur without the negative specifier jo
clause internally.
5.29    Jumbu!        Kot-ae           fgJj       jumbu!
        pull.UMP think. l-not.do press. r pull.I .lMP
        ' Haul (it in) ! Heedless (of all else), put your weight into it and haul (it in) ! '
The main verb is negated in 5 . 3 0 ; the lexicalised manner expression kotae kotae
'haphazardly (lit. not thinking not thinking)' does not influence it.
5 .30   Ghaka digh-ari=da   asi ii                sagho ava,    jo  kot-ae +kot-ae

        bamb-ae+e-raera.
        gather.l-not.do+do.I-CUST . 1 PL.FN
        ' Those vines and poles for constructing a canoe (platform), we don't just gather
        haphazardly from anywhere.'
   In some cases, the negative deverbal preceding verb stems in an SVC functions similarly
to a participle. In 5.3 1 , the nominal object and the deverbal, bayau itae 'not having cooked
                                                                                                 SVCs     1 65food' , function as an incorporated unit modifying the ellipsed subj ect referenced on the
verb as second person singular.
5.3 1    Nange-tira-i             bayau it-ae            fas+e r-av-esi?
         do.whatJ-TP.3S .FN-CEFF food     cook.I-not.do lie+do.I IPF-sleep-PRES.2S .AQ?
         ' How come you, not having cooked the food, are lying down and sleeping?'
    Occasionally, however, the negative deverbal, occurring without jo, intervenes in a
string of verb stems. The role played by the deverbal in these cases is unclear. Does it form
a nominal+verb combination with the verb stem e ' do ' , which is not phonologically
distinguishable, and function as a constituent of the svc? If it does not, is it marking the
terminus of an svc that functions as an oblique manner argument of the following verb or
as a participial modifier of the subject? A good example is 5.32, taken from the translation
of Luke 1 3 : 7.
5 .32    Tava+e       g-ae,          bune         jare-do . . .
         look.for+do see.I-not.do not.know.I despair. I-sEQ.SS
         ' We looked for (it), and not seeing it, we were fl ummoxed . . . '
The Korafe men questioned disagreed on how this construction should be viewed, although
all of them insisted that a phonological j uncture (marked by a comma) occurs at the
interface of gae 'not seeing' and bune 'not know'. The two younger men said that gae 'not
seeing' should be written gae e ' do the act of not seeing'. If the younger men's option is
correct, the combination gae+ e 'not seeing+do' should be a constituent of a contiguous
svc. Why, then, do they assert that a comma is necessary, as if it were a non-contiguous
svc?
   The older man adamantly insisted that only gae 'not seeing' should be written. With this
option, it is necessary to posit two svcs, the first one being tava e gae 'having looked for
and not seeing ' . Since it is phonologically distinct from bune jaredo 'not know and give up
hope' , tava e gae 'having looked for and not seeing' cannot be a manner argument of bune
'not know' . However, it can be an svc acting as a participial expression that modifies the
subject. This option provides a more satisfactory explanation of the construction.","[182, 183, 184, 185]"

4.7. 1 SENTENCE PROSODIES
   Heavy stress or accent marks the thematic, topical and focal constituents in Korafe
utterances. Physiologically, accent is produced by the expulsion of an increased amount of
air from the lungs. In terms of how it is perceived, accent in Korafe coincides with
increases or maj or changes in one or more of three prosodic parameters: duration, intensity
or loudness, and pitch.
   Length in Korafe is associated not only with word stress; increased length is also
associated with accented syllables of utterances (see § 1 .5 and §3 . 1 . 1 ) . Inherently stressed
syllables may be reduced in length when they are not the accented syllables in utterances.
Because of the tendency in Korafe to space stresses uniformly throughout the utterance,
some syllables get reduced to the point of being omitted.
                                                    Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences    141   Loudness i s indicated by amplitude curves in graphs, which were produced for this study
using the CECIL (Computerised Extraction of Components of Intonation in Language)
program: (Hunt 1 990). Amplitude curves display the average heights of the sound wave
from crest to trough correlated with utterances measured over a small fraction of a second.
(The graphs used in this book are calibrated at one tenth of a second.) Two figures are
given for each sound at the measured point in time, the positive number of decibels (dB)
measured from the centre of the frame up and the negative measured from the centre of the
frame down.
   The pattern of pitch changes associated with an utterance or a part of an utterance is
registered by frequency curves (or ' intonation contours'). These contours display the
number of vibrations or hertz (Hz) the sound wave produces in a fraction of a second. Total
intonation contours consist of a precontour and a primary contour that are pronounced
together (Pike 1 945:25-26). The precontour has unstressed syllables, which either rise or
fall in pitch. The primary contour begins with an inherently stressed syllable, termed a
'tonic syllable' by Ladefoged ( 1 975 :99). 1 8 This tonic syllable carries a major pitch change,
either an increase or a decrease in the frequency of the sound wave. A tonic syllable that
occurs with the highest pitch in the intonation contour is called the 'peak ' . Korafe contour
patterns associated with the primary contour, incorporating and continuing the changes that
begin on the tonic syllable, include: falling, falling-slight rise, rising-falling, slight
rise-slight fall-slight rise, and slight fall-slight rise-slight fall. One or more intonation
contours constitute a rhythm unit. A rhythm unit consists of an utterance or part of an
utterance that is bordered by pauses or silence.
   Although the amplitude and frequency curves sometimes vary in harmony with each
other in Korafe, more frequently they fluctuate independently. Thus, the speaker can
indicate thematic, topical and focal constituents with increased length, increased loudness, a
significant fluctuation in pitch or any combination of the three. Prosodic amalgamations
differ in their constituents from utterance to utterance and from speaker to speaker. For
instance, Bensted Keghana ( BK) and Kingsley Seko (KS) assigned distinct frequency curves
(or intonation contours) and amplitude curves to the clause in example 4.98. These are
shown on the following page.
4.98    Ni y-aresa,           ai tefo?
        2S go.DUR-F.2S.FN yes no
        ' Will you go, yes or no?'
   Keghana's utterance is one rhythm group with four intonation contours: ( 1 ) Ni ya re
(2) sa, (3) ai (4) te-fo? 1 9 Seko breaks the rhythm unit constituting his utterance into five
intonation contours: ( 1 ) Ni (2) ya-re (3) sa, (4) ai (5) te-fo?","[160, 161]"

5.4 BONDING AND THE CLAUSAL STATUS OF svcs
   The relationship of the clause to the svc has long been a matter of debate8 among
linguists. There is no simple answer to the question. Are they lexemes, predicates, clauses,
or something more than a clause? The degree of integration or bonding between verb stems
in SVCS can be measured by several variables: ( 1 ) the distance between verbal predicates,8       West African language scholars Williamson ( 1 965), Boadi ( 1 968) and Stahlke ( 1 970) posited that
        some SVcs are derived from multisentence underlying structures, but Schachter ( 1 974:262) proposed
        that ""a verb phrase concatenation"" rather than a multisentence underlying structure is all that is
        necessary. Li and Thompson ( 1 973) saw the possibility of both multiclausal and multic1ausal SVcs in
        Mandarin. Baker's ( 1 989) object-sharing analysis, Schiller's ( 1 989) auto lexical semanticosyntactic
        analysis, and Durie's ( 1 992) fused conceptual structure (that follows lackendoffs linking theory to
        assign more than one semantic role to an N P ) are all attempts to explain a multic1ausal analysis,
        especially of those cases where ""each transitive verb in the series has its own object (Schiller
        1989:405).""
1 66      Chapter 5(2) how many and which argument referents are shared by the predicates, (3) the scope of
inflectional categories (such as negation, tense, aspect, mood) in relationship to the
sequence of verbs, (4) the lexicalisation status of the verbal sequence, and (5) phonological
criteria. On a continuum registering degree of bonding, S V S S that have undergone
phonological reduction and are lexical compounds would be at one end and non-contiguous
SVCs separated by pauses and/or conj unctions at the other end.
   Only a few conventional SVSs have fused phonologically, becoming tightly integrated
lexical compounds. These include posture + iri 'remain' combinations 5 .33a and direction
verb + motion verb sequences 5 .33b.
5 .33a.    jasa+e        +   irira               � jas+ ir-ira (fasirira)
           recline+do    +   remain-PRES.3S.F � recline.do+remain-PRES.3S .FN
           'recline'         ' she is remaining'    'she is lying down'
5.3 3b.     vose         +   a-ira             � vos+a-ira (vosaira)
            descend. !   +   gO.NDUR-TP.3S .FN � descend. HgO.NDUR-TP.3 S .FN
            ' descend'       'he went'           'he descended'
   Quite a number of conventional S V S s recur in Korafe and are utilised as standard
expressions for regularly associated events, e.g. se ningi 'discuss (lit. speak hear)' and kote
do ' forgive (lit. think leave off) ' . They can be considered compound lexemes. Mostly
combinations of two verbs, some of these compound lexemes encode semantic notions,
such as ( 1 ) postural states, (2) directional movements, (3) manner+motion, (4) perception­
communication, and (5) cultural routines. Other compound lexemes have developed a
syntactic relationship in which the final stem has become an auxiliary verb to the initial
lexical one. These convey superlative performance of an action, comprehensive-completive
events, and the conative mood. These lexically and grammatically fixed expressions having
an svc format are more fully explicated in §9. 1 .
   The prototypical svc that Lane and Pawley ( 1 992:6) posit, building on earlier work by
Bradshaw ( 1 982:28) and Crowley ( 1 987 :38, 1 990 :60-6 1 ) does not manifest any clause­
internal boundaries. Their list of characteristics includes the following points:
( 1 ) the two or more verbs that are constituents of SVCs do not contrast in their inflections,
(2) overt morphemes such as coordinators, subordinators or switch-reference markers do
    not occur,
(3) there is no intonational evidence of clause boundary,
(4) core arguments (actor and undergoer) are either identical or the undergoer of the first
    verb becomes the actor of the next,
(5) in some instances, the scope of negation and adverbs extends over the entire sequence
    of verbs.
Foley and Olson ( 1 985 :56-57) specify the nature of argument relationships in SVCS in more
detail. In nuclear layer serialisation, the sequence of verbs is joined in a complex predicate
with one set of arguments. Core layer serialisation joins verbs together that have in
common the set of oblique arguments and one of the core arguments. Their definition of the
                                                                                   SVCs     1 67clause as ""a grammatical structure consIstmg of one and only one non-composite
periphery"" encompasses SVCS joined at both nuclear and core layers.
   Non-contiguous SVCS do not qualify as prototypical SVCs, because they do occur with
coordinators, and because pauses and pause words intervene between verbal constituents.
Some of them do not meet Foley' s and Olson's criteria; they have independent peripheries.
For instance, in example 5 .34, two locations are involved. One is stated in the previous
clause as % % 'the verandas' where the addressees are situated when they get (bu) the
firebrand.
5.34   Sifo eni,          a.   avaraka bu             b.   vose
       day one                 fire    get.!               descend. !
       c . dendegu               ominda              use-vu!
       village. courtyard       that.CEFF. T/F .LOC blow. up.I-IPM .2PL.AQ
       ' One day, get a firebrand (from the fire), get down (from your verandas) and
       get the fire going there in the courtyard). '
The second is encoded b y dendegu ominda 'there i n the courtyard' , the place the addressees
are instructed to move to.
  Contiguous SVCS by and large do qualify as prototypical SVCs, some being joined at the
nuclear layer, illustrated by example 5 .35, and others at the core layer, as in example 5.36.
5.35    ... na /uka=imi            gambu fiti     do=do . . .
               I S pig=CEFF.T/F bite.!    put.I leave.I=SEQ.SS
       ' . . . a pig bit me, put (me) down and left (me) . . . '
In example 5 . 36, sirige ' launch' is transitive and has ghaka 'canoe' as its object, but
sembojighera 'they came across' is intransitive and shares its subject referent only with
sirige.
5.36   . . . ne ghaka sirige        semb+oji+gh-era . . .
            3PL canoe launch.I cross. I+come.NDUR+position-SEQ.PAST.3PL.FN
       , . . . they launched the canoe and came across . . . '
In both of the above examples, each verb contributes its ful l lexical meaning to the
construction; the intransitive combination sembojighera does not gain an object, but just is
meshed with the transitive predicate in a series of events whose borders are left indistinct. It
is possible to convert the verb stem sirige to a medial verb sirigedo, distinguishing more
clearly the temporal relationship between the transitive predicate and the intransitive
compound lexeme without changing the basic meaning of the sequence.
   Some contiguous SVCS terminate with a verb expressing an aspect. For example, the
verb dadabe ' finish' contributes a comprehensive completive meaning when it combines in
                                                                             ,
a serial construction such as mindi dadabe 'utterly consume (lit. eat finish) .
5.37a. Na bayau mindi dadabe-teni.
       IS      food     eaU finish.I-TP. I S .AQ
       ' I totally consumed the portion of food I was given. '
The Korafe cannot change the sequence to 5.37b.
1 68   Chapter 55.37b. *Na bayau mindi-do     dadabe-Ieni.
        I S food eat.I-SEQ.SS finish.l-TP . I S .AQ
The Korafe response to 5.3 7b is laughter. The closest meaning that could be assigned to it
is: I ale food and I terminated. However, animate entities die (ambu); they do not terminate
(dadabe). The lexical verb sequence is acceptable in example 5 .3 7c which contains a
different subject medial verb + verb and encodes the perfective aspect.
5 .37c. Na bayau mind-eno                    dadabe-lira.
        I S food       eat.I-SEQ.R. I S . DS finish.l-TP.3S.FN
        ' I have finished eating.'
    I n example 5.37a, the verb stem + dadabe has fused t o the point where its meaning as a
unit, 'I totally consumed my allotted portion of food' differs from the meaning of its parts,
' I eat' and ' I finish ' . However, the SVC combinations in example 5 . 3 5 and 5 . 3 6 do not
evidence this level of fusion; the meaning of the unit does not differ from the meaning of its
parts. Syntactically, the verbs in 5 . 37a belong to one clause, but in 5 .3 7c, they belong to
two clauses. The semantic difference between casting the verbs in an SVC or in an S R C
(switch-reference construction) is that the SRC makes explicit the temporal relationship
between the events encoded by the verbs. Whereas in the SVC (5.37a) the focus is on the
fact that the food portion was totally consumed, the focus in the SRC (5 .37c) is on finishing
the act of eating.
    What is the clausal status of constructions manifesting core serialisation in which each
of the verbal predicates has its own object? Do they operate as fused units like the aspectual
S V C in 5 . 3 7a? In 5 . 3 8 , the axe (010) is the object of bu ' get' , but the ellipsed object,
jambura 'dugong', is the understood object ofje basiseri 'they gashed and bored' .
5.38    ... 010 b u je           basi-serio
            axe get. I gash.! bore. Ii-DP . I PL .AQ
        , . . . we got an axe and bashed (the dugong) breaking its skin.'
Foley and Olson ( 1 985:44) cite a similar example in Barai, which is given as example 5.39.
5.39    Fu burede ije       sime abe ufu.
        3S bread DEF knife take cut
        ' He cut the bread with a knife.'
They suggest (p.44) that the use of abe 'take' in this Barai example is ""basically a valence­
increasing device; it introduces an instrumental argument into the core frame"". They posit
two role frames for the lexical entry assigned to abe : [A ,U] and [A,U,I]lvt. They note that
predicates in SVCs bond together forming a complex nucleus to which the entire set of
arguments must relate as a unit.
   It is not clear in Korafe that the use of bu 'get' in these cases is basically a valence­
increasing device, introducing an instrumental argument into the core frame. It is often
juxtaposed with transitive verbs in Korafe when the resultant combination does not involve
an instrumental reading. Examples like nu 010 bu mutira 'he got the axe and gave it', or nu
ghamana bu gira 'he got the rock and looked at it' , or nu 010 bu vegelira 'he got the axe
and sharpened it' are all possibilities.
                                                                                     SVCs    1 69   The verb bu appears to contribute its full lexical value to the SVC sequence in the same
way as its corresponding medial form budD does to the SRC medial verb sequence, which is
multiclausal and preserves separate role frames for the verbs. Instruments can be marked by
i or imi without occurring with the verb bu. And the verb bu can have as its syntactic object
an instrument marked by imi. Examples 5 .40a and b use the same lexical sequence as 5 .3 8 .
5 .40a.   . . . genembo gi-do,         goraba a=imi         ale     gae-do,

          and gets rocks and gashes and punctures (the wallabies with them) and they die . . . '
The version given in 5 .40b is a revision of 5.40a, made by a Korafe editor. It uses
customary medial forms, a shortened version of the effector of change marker i and the
verb stem bu in place of the medial form budo.
5 .40b.   . .. gi-do,       goroba=i ale       gae-do,        ii  ghamana=i bu

          and gets rocks and gashes and punctures (the wallabies with them) and they die . . . '
The verb sequences used in 5 .40 represent the standard event schema the Korafe use to
describe hunting and killing wallabies. In example 5 .40a, the obj ect ghamana 'rocks' is
marked by aimi ' with that' and serves as the obj ect of the medial form, budD 'get' and the
understood instrument of je basari ' he will gash and puncture ' . The use of the fuller
marking aimi places extra focus on the instrument. In 5.40b, the use of the short form of the
effector of change marker i without a demonstrative places less emphasis on the
instrumental argument. When the instrument is unmarked and merely functions as the
object of bu 'get' , as in example 5 .38, the verb it occurs with represents an event that is
slightly more individuated and less integrated with the following events than its marked
counterpart. The verb sequence bu je basiseri 'they got, gashed, and bored' terminates
example 5 .38, but the sentence that follows it in the narrative begins with the sequence, Je
basetera, without bu. The omission of bu in the recapitulated segment suggests that it may
not be bound as tightly to je basiseri as the latter two verbs are bound to each other.
   Durie ( 1 992:48-5 1 ) also notes that some SVCs appear to allow for multiple thematic role
assignments. Like Foley and Olson, he prefers a solution using semantic notation in the
lexicon to j ust ""permitting multiple role assignments and saying nothing more"". His
solution preserves the integrity of the original role frame for the instrumental verb. He
assumes that an argument can bear different semantic roles simultaneously and employs
1 70      Chapter 5lackendoff s9 notational system to illustrate the conceptual structures available to TAKE.
Durie initially assigns TAKE (bu in Korafe) the PATIENT role it has with oto ' axe ' . He then
argues that this structure assumes an INSTRUMENTAL role in the overall configuration of the
conceptual structure of the SVC (oto bu je basiseri in Korafe). Thus, he argues for a fusion
of ""the argument structures, allowing for an integrated set of semantic roles"".
   Applying Durie's solution to Korafe would greatly increase and complicate the entries in
the lexicon. One would have to apply this instrumental analysis to quite a number of verbs,
e.g. ale 'throw' , bambu ' gather' , keve 'carve' , dighi 'tie', tendi ' lash' as well as bu 'get',
which themselves occur with many different verbs i n svcs. IO However, i f we allow that the
lexicon can be as large as the lexicographer chooses, what are the criteria determining
entries? Do we want discontinuous verb sequences to count as lexemes? The alternate
strategy Durie mentions-""permitting multiple role assignments""-seems preferable for
Korafe.
Fusion of predicate frames seems impossible in cases where Korafe non-contiguous SVCS
exhibit switches in subjects as well as the switches in objects. Switches in subject reference
that are not overtly coded by the verbal morphology may occur in: ( 1 ) cases of referential
overlap, (2) constructions expressing physiological and psychological responses, (3)
changes of temporal, spatial, and circumstantial settings, and (4) cases where distinct verbal
predicates encode perception and the perceived entity. Referential overlap is exhibited in
example (5.4 1 ). The subject shifts from na ' I ' to nangae ' we two' between vose 'I descend'
and mindorasi ' let' s us two eat, that was said! '5.41         a.   na viti                  b.     jegha=6       bu                  c.    vose       nangae

             mind-or-asi!

             'I will climb up and get the pandanus fruits, climb down and let's eat them the two
             of us (repeated quotation)! '
Although no shift in subject reference i s indicated at lange ' open' in example 5 .42, the
subject Ghebu Mose is not the subject of atetira ' it dawned', sifo 'day' i s. In fact in this
change of temporal setting, the two verbal predicates do not share any argument referents.5 .42a.      Ghebu+ Mose            diti lange
             ghebu. tree+young.lady eye open.!
9         lackendoff ( 1 990) restricts role-doubling by determining which 9-role is dominant in the bound
          complex of 9-roles (the entire set available to the svc). The fused set of 9-roles for an individual verb
          (also termed its fused conceptual structure) arises from the role structures it evidences in its lexical
          entries.
10
          Schiller (J 989:4 1 5) notes that ""so many verbs can take instrumental oblique objects that it would seem
          that most transitive verbs should be treated as triadic"". He suggests freely permitting instrumental
          complements for transitive verbs and requiring lexical licensing for directional and goal complements.
          Durie ( \ 992:46) himself notes that Kalam also manifests proliferation of ""instrumental verbs"".

In example 5 .43, the girl is understood to be the subject of ere ' she arose' , but she has no
role in the event encoded by the following predicate, sandi aviri 'they grabbed and slept' (a
euphemism for having sexual relations) . She just sees it.

Such subj ect shifts mirror the apparent anomalies that the switch-reference system exhibits
and are more fully discussed in Chapter 7. These examples with their distinct sets of
arguments appear to be multiclausal like the switch-reference examples they mirror.
  Thus, Korafe data appear to ""permit multiple role assignments"" in some SVcs. These
SVCs are defined by having one or more of the following characteristics:
( 1 ) embedded clauses and quotations (examples 5 .20 and 5 .25) intervene between verb
      stems,
                                                                II
(2) pauses, pause words, and conjunctions occur,
(3) the verbal constituents themselves indicate shifts in location and temporality or have
    separate role frames that characterise peripheral or clausal junctures (Foley and Olson
    1 985 :56-57). (For Korafe examples, see examples 5 . 1 6 and 5 .34.)
   When the entire set of Korafe SVCs, both contiguous and non-contiguous is accounted
for, the continuum registering the degree of bonding of verb sequences extends from fused
lexical verb compounds to clauses and complex constructions that appear to be more than
one clause. As Lane and Pawley ( 1 992: 1 9) suggest, ""there is no natural break between
multiclause and single-clause constructions, only a continuum of types"". Most SVCs fit
Foley and Olson' s typology which extends the single-predicate clause to accommodate a
multilayered clausal approach, in which the SVc has only one role frame. However, not all
Korafe S V C S fit within these single clausal limits . Some, like the switch-reference
constructions, are joined at the peripheral layer. The deviations from prototypical SVCs that
non-contiguous serial verb constructions manifest are indicative of their ambiguous
position between monoclausal SVCS and multiclausal SRCs. They have the morphology of
SVCs, but syntactically and phonologically, they often manifest multiclausal features.","[185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191]"

4.4.2 PERCEPTION AND FEELING PREDICATIONS
   Perceptions are expressed by a small group of two-place predicates which occur with
either agent or experiencer semantic roles as subject and object-theme as object. Verbs
predicating perception clauses include: gi ' see, look at' , ningi ' hear, listen to, obey ' ,
kasame e 'know, learn' , bune 'not know' , itatame ' feel, touch' , tambu ' meet up with, look
for', kote 'think', tumonde 'believe, trust' , dubo bu ' love ' , uju e ' want', oju e ' fear, be
afraid of . In example 4.53, the syntactic subject is an agent [+volition, +control] overtly
present as an NP in the initial clause and co-referenced on the verb of perception, gosudo
(aira) 'he went along looking at' .
4.53   ... kora=da   ata+kotu aminda              gosu-do       a-ira

       3S.wife=ALOC arrive. I-SEQ.SS
       ' . . . he went along the beach looking at the footprints and approached his wife . . .      '
The subject of example 4.54 is an experiencer [-control, -volition], one who merely
receives the information.
4.54   Na binD ningi-do          dudukughe-do            ghamo keinghu-sira.

       'I heard the news and was surprised and was startled out of my wits. '
   The object of perception verbs is sometimes a sentential complement. The complement
is underlined in example 4.55. As the comma indicates, the pause between the two bases in
                                             ,
this sentence follows ava 'that (contrastive) .

       knowledge+not.do=CoP .AQ
       ' . . .1 didn't know where I left the canoe. '
   With the verbal lexeme oju e 'fear, be afraid o f and occasionally with uju e 'want', the
object is marked by the benefactive-purpose postposition dae 'on account of .
4.56   Namane evetu+genembo vuvuji=dae                     oju+e-raera.

1 26     Chapter 4Purpose and negative purpose or apprehension constructions marked by the complementiser
dae ' on account of are often sentential complements of uju e 'want' and oju e ' fear'
respectively. These constructions are more fully discussed in §7.2.2.

4.4.3 IMPERSONAL EXPERiENTIAL PREDICATIONS
   Korafe has a set of impersonal experiential predications that encode involuntary
physiological and emotional responses. 'Impersonal constructions' are so-called because
any entity that could be construed as controlling or motivating the response is non­
volitional and non-personal. These impersonal predications have the following
characteristics:
( 1 ) up to three entities may be indicated by overt NPs. They are: (a) an animate entity,
      usually human, who experiences the affecting stimulus and responds, (b) the body part
      affected, and (c) the emotion or bodily response. 7
(2) the animate entity making the response is not cross-referenced on the verb as subject,
    and is not in control of its response. Its syntactic status is discussed in detail below.
(3) the verbal predicate invariably cross-references a third person singular subject,
    regardless of the person and number of the overt NPs.
   Physiological responses have three common components: ( 1 ) an animate entity (often
represented by a personal pronoun), (2) an optional body part (represented by an NP such as
jiro 'head') and (3) a body response which has a verbal component (i.e. merna resira ' it is
hurting (lit. it is saying pain)').
        physiological response: (1) animate entity (2) (body part) (3) body response+V
    Emotional responses have two basic components: ( 1 ) an animate entity and (2) an
emotion usually expressed in a nominal+verb combination (i.e. dubo merna erira 'he or she
is sad (lit. he or she/it is doing neck pain)').
        emotional response: ( 1 ) animate entity (2) emotion+V
   Examples 4.58, 4.59, and 4.60 typify physiological responses. In each of these cases, a
human entity (na ' I ' or namane 'we') is the initial element labelled ( 1 ) in the predication.
The second element labelled (2) is the body part involved : jiro 'head' or ala ' leg' . The third
element labelled (3) is the bodily response.
4.58      ( 1 ) Na           (2) jiro         (3) sarig-er-ira.
                IS                 head             split- IPF PRES.3S. FN
                                                             -                ' I have a splitting headache. (lit. lime head is splitting)'7      Korafe does not mark the body part or the emotion as inalienably possessed, as some languages do.
       Roberts ( l 988a: 1 00) documents both for Amele, a Papuan language from the Madang Province.
                                                     Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences    1 27   Example 4 . 5 8 has two overt N P arguments na ' 1 ' and jiro ' head', the response is
registered by the verb sarigerira ' it is splitting' . Example 4.59a has the same two overt
arguments as 4.58, but a verbal lexeme (nominal + verb: mema resira ' it hurts (lit. says
pain)') indicates the bodily response.
4.59a. ( 1 ) Na        (2) jiro           (3) mema+re-s-ira.
             IS               head              pain+IPF-say-PRES.3S.FN
       'I have a headache. (lit. lime head is saying pain.)'
It is possible to use a possessive pronoun with some body parts in a sentence like 4.59a.
The word ungo 'armlhand' shown in 4.59b illustrates this.
4.59b. ( 1 ) Nanda      (2) ungo       (3) mema+re-s-ira.
             IS.GEN          arm           pain+IPF-say-PRES.3S.FN
       ' My arm is hurting (lit. saying pain).'
In some cases, there is no body part included, just the bodily response, ighoi etiri ' it did
hunger' or 'hunger did' in (4.60).
4.60   . . . vare+begata=da semb+i-se,
             garden+path=Loc cross.l+go.DUR-SIM.SS

                l .PL.EXC       hunger+dO. I-SEQ.R.3S.DS
       ' . . . as (we) were crossing on the garden path, we got hungry and. . . '
   Predications indicating emotional responses pattern like example 4.6 1 have two basic
elements: ( 1 ) the animate entity and (3) the emotion.
4.6 1 a. ( 1 ) Na   (3) dubo+mema+er-ira.
               IS       neck+pain+IPF-do.PRES.3S.FN
         'I am overcome with grief. '
Unlike the physiological examples given above, the body part and the bodily response are
not separate entities.8 Instead, they form a compound nominal unit in Korafe, i .e. dubo
mema 'worry, grief, problem (lit. neck pain) ' . Example 4.61 b is ungrammatical.
4.61b. *(1 ) Nanda dubo mema                er-ira.
             I S.GEN neck pain              IPF-do.PRES.3S.FN
       'I am overcome with grief. '
8   There are contexts where it is acceptable to encode physiological responses by an animate entity
    possessing the body part. For example, Najiro mema resira 'I have a headache' can be changed to:
        Nanda jiro mema re-s-ira,                        nanange atimb-aoni?
        I S.GEN head pain          IPF-say-PRES.3S.FN do.how.! carry.slung.on.head-H. I S.AQ
        'My head is aching, how ever will I carry that stringbag slung on my head?'
    Most Korafe lexemes conveying emotions are metaphors composed of a body part (e.g. dubo 'neck') that
    co-lexicalises with a qualifier or a body response. After combination, these lexemes are inseparable. Na
    dubo mema erira ' I am sad (lit. lime neck pain it is doing)' cannot be changed to *Nanda dubo mema
    erira ' my neck is doing pain', nor is it possible to insert a negative focus marker, *Nanda dubo jQ mema
    aeri. But dubo mema 'worry, sadness' can be used as a nominal compound:
        Nanda dubo+mema=mo evi=ri.
        I S.GEN neck+pain=T1F          this.CT=COP.AG
        ' My problem, (well, it) is this.'
1 28     Chapter 4This nominal compound can either be regarded as a complement incorporated into the stem
of a verbal lexeme (nominal + verb) or a separate NP argument if expanded into a full NP
with modifiers, e.g. dubo merna feria beM ' very great grief .
   It should be noted that the animate entity experiencing the emotion is sometimes cross­
referenced as the verb.
4.62      ( 1 ) Na (3) dubo+mema+er-ena.
                IS      neck+pain+IPF-do.PRES. I S.FN
          'J am upset over this(lit. I am doing neck pain). ' (And I ' m going to stay that way.)The semantic difference between examples 4 . 6 1 a and 4.62 is one of control . The
impersonal rendering in 4.6 1 a registers an involuntary emotion, something that over­
whelms the animate experiencer. In example 4.62, the animate entity controls the emotion,
choosing to nurse it over a period of time or even to generate it in his mind.
   The syntactic function of the animate entity experiencing the bodily process or emotion
cannot be conclusively established in Korafe. It could quite possibly have object function,
because it is an unmarked non-subject argument.9 If that were the case, the clause in the
impersonal experiential construction would have OSV as its normal order. It should be noted
that unlike other clauses manifesting O S V order, in this construction, the putative S
constituent is never marked with the effector of change marker imi.
   In fact, there are no clear grammatical criteria for identifying the subj ect of the
impersonal experiential construction, beyond the third person singular subject agreement
marker on the verb. There are at least three posssibilities regarding the identification of a
subject. 10
( 1 ) The body part affected or the bodily response NP when they are not incorporated in the
      verb are the subject.
(2) Some unspecified (in most cases) stimulus triggering the response is the subject.
(3) There is no subject. If this solution is adopted, it could apply globally to all cases.
  Assigning semantic roles to arguments in these predications is also problematic. The
most plausible role designation for the animate entity is experiencer, and for the body part9      In those Papuan languages that do mark the verb for object agreement, it is clear that the animate entity
       is cross-referenced as the object. (See Roberts 1 988a:97, Reesink 1 983 :232-233, and Olson 1 98 1 :296-
       298.)
10
       Stirling ( 1 993 :242-243) gives a fourth explanation for impersonal constructions in Amele, involving a
       'dummy subject'. Rejecting Roberts' (forthcoming:77) solution that ""incorporated nominals"" encoding
       emotions are co-referenced as subject, she ( 1 993 :242-243) cites the occurrence of the 'pseudo-passive'
       in Amele as support for setting up a third person singular ' dummy subject'.
            However, one cannot claim precedence for a dummy subject from the pseudo-passive set in Korafe,
       because Korafe uses a third person plural, not singular, form for the pseudo-passive, as jitoro 'they put'
       below shows .
         ... 'telephone exchange ' nanange-do         jit-oro             Popondetta ghe-do

rather than an experiencer has subject function in impersonal predications encoding
physiological responses. This reverses the subject-accessibility hierarchy, referred to in
§3.2.2 . 1 , in which experiencer is selected as subject before patient. The fact is, though, that
the animate entity never has subject function in impersonal predications. It does, however,
have the genitive circumstantial role in some predications expressing physiological
responses (see example 4.59b).
   The question before us is what the third person subject marking on the verb is agreeing
with. Let us briefly consider each of the syntactic alternatives along with some semantic
alternatives.
   1 . In physiological responses, the most likely candidate for syntactic subject is the body
part experiencing the response. In examples 4.58 and 4.59a, this NP is a body part, jiro
'head', and in 4.59b ungo ' hand ' . It agrees in person with the third person subject
agreement marking on the verb. However, as plural marking never occurs in such
constructions this fact is not diagnostic. In terms of the semantic relations between
constituents, this body part NP encodes the most likely entity experiencing the response. I I
   Physiological or emotional responses (e.g. ighoi etiri 'got hungry' in example 4.60 and
dubo merna erira 'felt grief) can be considered to be incorporated into the verb. However,
when the nominal is modified as in ighoi ambarako etiri 'got extremely hungry' and dubo
merna teria bekQ erira ' is totally overwhelmed by grief , it is certainly a third person
singular form with which the verb could agree.
   2. Viewing an unspecified external stimulus as the subject would scarcely be feasible if
there were no cases where a stimulus is specified. However, in example 4.63, a stimulus is
specified. The flounder's biting the narrator is the external stimulus provoking the vexation
Cedric Moghara reported in the story from which 4.63 is taken.
4.63a. [Gamb-iri. l sTI MULUS      [dubo+eko+e-tiri] RESPONSE gi-do.        kaiya

        ' (The flounder) bit (me), and it greatly upset (me), and I got a knife, poked,
        slashed, and generally severed the (mesh connections of my) fish net.'
In this case the stimulus would be treated similarly to the way the initial event in clause
sequences encoding completive aspect is treated. In example 4.63b the subject of dadabetiri
'it finished' is the event,furu dighero 'they lashed the fence'.
4.63b . . ..furu digh-ero                dadabe-tiri . . .

        they lashed the fence            and it finished
        ' . . . they finished lashing (together) the fence . . . '
II
     Roberts ( 1 988a: 1 00) treats body parts as subjects in Amele impersonal experiential constructions where
     they occur.
1 30      Chapter 4   In the same way , it is possible that the subject of dubo eko etiri '(I) got angry (lit. it did
anger)' is the event gambiri ' it bit (me)' .
   I f this option were chosen, 1 2 one could posit the fol lowing two revised sets o f
participatory arguments for impersonal experiential predications. This solution would allow
the physiological response to be an object, either incorporated in the verb or a separate
constituent from the verb, having the same syntactic role in the cases illustrated in
examples 4.6 1 a and 4.62. 1 3 Physiological response predications would have the following
semantic roles : locus, patient and/or force , and object-theme (where the nominal is a
separate N P ). Emotional response predications would have these arguments: experiencer,
force, and object-theme (where the nominal is a separate N P).
   3 . If the final option were adopted, it could apply globally to all cases, including the
ones where only an animate entity and a nominal+verb combination exist, e.g. 4.60 and
4.6 1 a, in which there is no NP overtly present in the clause that would trigger subject
agreement. However, this option is controversial. Subject is considered by many to be an
indispensable element in a complete sentence. 14
   To sum up, the evidence is divided. Where a body part is present in physiological
responses, it is a reasonable candidate for subject. Option (2) is attractive , but there are too
few instances where a stimulus is specified to provide conclusive evidence.
    These impersonal experiential predications are somewhat unusual in that subject and
topic are maintained as distinct entities. The animate entity is the topic constituent in this
construction, corresponding to P I in the formula P I SOY (Dik 1 978 :20-2 1 ) . Since it never
has subject function, this animate entity cannot be realised by the focal actor pronoun, as
illustrated in 4.64a. Example 4.64b likewise demonstrates that it cannot be emphasised by
t% 'self which marks an actor taking credit for an accomplishment.
4.64a. *Nane       ighoi+er-ira.
          I S.ACT hunger+IPF -do.PRES.3S.FN
                                             ,

         I S self   hunger+I PF-do.P RE S.3S. FN
       'I myself am making myself hungry. '
Since the animate entity has topic function , it obligatorily precedes the negative focus
markerjo.
4.65a. Na jo     ighoi+ae=ri.
       I S NEG hunger+not.do=COP.AQ
       'I'm not hungry. ' or 'Nothing is making me hungry.'","[145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150]"
"16     As discussed in §2.4. 1 2, the addressee o f imperatives i s coreferenced a s the subject.
          The subject argument normally controls the use of the reflexive nominal form to/a 'self,
       possession, relative', but not always, as the following example illustrates.
          Na Edrick=dae, to/a nunda oto ava                   mut-eno               b-ira.

       dog eat. U-SIM.SS growl+IPF-say-PREs.1S,.AQ
       that is causing the dogs to growl while they 're eating it?'
The coreference status of the subjects in the terminal clause of purpose constructions with
the subjects of matrix clauses is also monitored. As terminal predicates in purpose
constructions, deverbal forms indicate coreferentiality of subject and os irrealis medial verb
forms indicate disparity of subject. This is illustrated in the examples in 3 . 5 5 .
3 .55a Same Subject:
       Na Tufi y-ari=dae          er-ena.
       1 S Tufi gO.OUR-OYB=PUR IPF-do.PRES ..l.S..FN
       'I'm about to go to Tufi.'
3.55b Different Subject:
      Nu [na Tufi y-aono=dae]                        re-s-ira.
      3S 1 S Tufi gO.OUR-SEQ.IR..l.S..OS=PUR IPF-say-PRES.1S,.FN
      ' He is saying that I will (must) go to Tufi.'
(3) Korafe has focal actor pronouns (pronoun stem marked by -ne, as in nane ' I', nene
    'you all/they ') which only copy or replace subject NPs (with animate referents). No
    matter where this pronoun is placed in the ordering of constituents in the clause, it
    clearly identifies the subject.
(4) When a predication is deverbalised, only the subject relation can assume a genitive
    relationship with the deverbal nominative.
As the subject in example 3 . 5 6b, Kokombara can be the possessor of the act of running
(sumbari). But '60' cannot, so 3 .56c is ill-formed.
3 .56a. Kokombara 60 sumb-ira.
        Kokombara 60 run.I-TP.3S.FN
        ' Kokombara ran fast (like 60 miles an hour). '
3 .56b. Kokombara=da sumb-ari
        Kokombara=GEN run.l-OYB
        ' Kokombara' s prowess in running'
3 .56c. *60=da     sumb-ari
         60=GEN    run.I-OBY
    Objects are defined negatively in Korafe as those core NPs with the grammatical
function 0 that are not cross-referenced by verbal suffixation. In addition, however, they
are the only NPs that can be relativised on in second position, their normal position. This is
illustrated by the obj ect bare 'taro seedlings' in example 3 . 57.
84       Chapter 33 . 57    Edna bare           nandae futu-sira         a=va,            gov-ari=dae
          Edna taro.seedlings I S.BEN give.II-DP.3S.FN that=CT          plant-DVB=PUR
          er-ena.
          IPF-do.PRES.1 S.FN
          ' I am about to plant those taro seedlings that Edna gave me.'
   Animate recipients (marked dae o r kena) and inanimate locative arguments (marked da)
in Korafe can be unmarked and placed before the object when they act as participants. See
the discussion on LOCUS arguments in §3.2.2. 1 .
   NPs internal to the clause that do not have core grammatical functions (A, S, and 0) have
oblique functions. Except for a few lexical exceptions that are listed below, NPs with
oblique functions have the structure of postpositional phrases. These phrases consist of
noun phrases marked by morphologically autonomous postpositions which cliticise to the
final constituent of the noun phrase. In example 3 . 58 the locative marker da 'at, in, to '
follows both NPs headed by fororo ' mud' .
3.58      a.   fororo=da                b. fororo raugo=da
               mud=LOC                     mud soft=LOC
                ' in the mud'              ' in the soft mud'
  NPs with oblique function basically correspond to and overlap with the set of
postpositional phrases that indicate circumstantial semantic case arguments.
   In contrast to NPs with core functions that get marked to indicate pragmatic functions,
those with oblique function lose their semantic case marking and are fronted when they
have the pragmatic role of topic. In example 3 . 59, the indirect object, Randall, has lost its
marking dae 'to, for' and been fronted to initial position in the sentence where it functions
as the topic for both clauses in the sentence.
3 . 59    Randall jakti         nane   mut-ena          a=va,     e/o=da=go         mut-esi.

          ' Randall I'd already given betelnut to, but you gave him (more) on top of (his due).'
In example 3 .60, i n which both clauses have only NPs with core functions, neither the
subject (A) nor the object (0) is marked in 3 .60a. But the object (0) in 3 .60b is marked by
ava 'that one contrastively' to contrast Boltin Yamboltin with the speaker, who is really the
addressee' s wife.

to the initial position in the clause. In example 3 .6 1 , the ningu 'needle' is fronted. It is not
marked for its instrumental function in its containing clause, because it is topicalised. The
demonstrative aimi 'with that one' indicates that it serves as a left-dislocated topicalised
instrument in the sentence.
3.61    Ningu    ati       gembu-raena           a=imi,        na genembo=da

         'The needle I use to weave string bags with that one, I am weaving (my)
        husband' s personal bag.'
The noun kambo ' house' is not marked as a locative argument with da in example 3 .62,
because it is relativised on and serves as the theme.
3 .62   Kambo evevetu         avi-raera            a=mo, mindafu =ri.
        house women. RED sleep-CUST.3PL.FN that=TIF big=COP.AQ
        ' That house where the women sleep is big. '
   Several words and expressions encoding temporal or manner notions are lexically fixed
as unmarked forms, but are still unambiguously interpreted as temporal or manner NPs with
oblique function. Many temporal and manner expressions that are marked have also been
lexicalised. In example 3 .63a oroko 'today' is an unmarked temporal word functioning as
an N P head, and sifode ' tomorrow' in 3 .63b is a PP that has lexicalised as a temporal
expression.
3 .63   a. Oroko    mind-aresa,     ai ?     b.   Sifo=de         mind-aresa,     ai ?
           today eaU-F.2S.FN yes                  day=coM.PL eatJ-F.2S.FN yes
           ' Will you eat (it) today?'            ' Will you eat (it) tomorrow?
Examples 3 .64a and b illustrate expressions encoding manner that are unmarked and
marked respectively.
3 .64a. Nu tefo      OJ-Ira.
        3S nothing come.N DUR-TP.3S.FN
        ' He came without anything./He didn't come with any specific purpose in mind.

3 .64b. Nu toto=i=go         oj-ira.
        3S speed=cEFF=CPAR come.NDUR-TP.3S.FN
        ' He came quickly. '
    Proper nouns encoding placenames also occur a s bare NPs, Even though Tuft i n example
3 .65 is a locative argument with oblique syntactic function, it is unmarked.
3 .65   Na Papilus 0 Selwyn Tu{i jo                 gae=ri.
        1 SG Papilus or Selwyn Tufi NEG not.see=COP.AQ
        'I didn't see Papilus or Selwyn at Tufi . '
86    Chapter 3   In this section, A, S, and 0, as defined by Dixon, have been used to discuss gramm atical
functions. In Korafe, A and S realise one grammatical relation, subject, so henceforth s will
stand for this grammatical relation that includes both transitive and intransitive subjects.","[102, 103, 104, 105, 106]"

II           The occurrence of pauses and pause words tends to correlate with clause boundaries in Korafe,
             although not all Korafe clauses are bordered by pauses and thematic NPs and PPS can be bordered by
             pauses. Giv6n ( l 990b:44-46) suggests similar findings for Tok Pisin, Tairora, and Kalam. The latter
             two are Papuan languages in the Eastern Highlands and Madang Provinces respectively.

5.5 SOME NOTES ON GRAMMATICI SATION IN KORAFE SVCs
   It is possible that some of the SS medial verbs have arisen in a grammaticisation process
involving serial verbs that have been reanalysed as grammatical functors. (Refer to §2.2.)
The verb stems do ' leave off and se ' say' are either homophonous with the markers of
sequencing and overlap relations indicated on terminal verbs in marking clauses or they
have grammaticised as the markers of these relationships. Given that the entire Binandere
family uses the same lexical verb stems to encode these relationships, grammaticisation is
feasible. (Refer to footnotes 13 and 15 in Chapter 2.) SS sequencing medial forms appear to
be combinations of stem I or stem II forms of verbs with do ' leave off , e.g. sedo 'say and' ,
gembudo ' weave and', avido 'dry and', sido (yarena) '( 1 will g o along) repeatedly saying
and' . The verb stem se ' say' apparently combines with stem II forms of the verb, yielding
SS simultaneous medial verb forms, such as sise 'while saying ' , gefuse 'while weaving' ,
and avise 'while drying' .
   Unlike African languages which have reanalysed verb stems as markers o f object and
case roles and as complementisers (Lord 1 993 :9-2 1 3), verb stems in Korafe, for the most
part, have not grammaticised as case role markers. As was discussed in the previous
section, the verb stem bu ' get' has not grammaticised, becoming solely an instrument
marker. It still contributes its full lexical value to SVCS in which it is a constituent.
   However, the verb ghe has several senses, some of which are 'grammatical' . The verb
ghe can mean ' move from' or ' continue doing'. Its aspectual use in encoding iteration at
irregular intervals and/or sequences of events performed as a habitual routine is discussed
in §9.2.4. 1 .2 . Together with the locative postposition da or placenames, it also encodes the
notion of source, occurring in both SVCS (as ghe) and SRCs (as ghedo). This is illustrated by
the combination sekarada ghe ' (move) from the coral head' in example 5 .44. The
postpositional phrase, sekara dengesida 'beside the coral head ' , illustrates the inessive
locative use of da.
5 .44   ... evetako-i      sekara=da      ghf                  buvu-do
            old.woman-CEFF coral.head=LOC move.from.I          arrive. I-SEQ.SS
        sekara           dengesi=da anumb+ir-iri . . .
        coral.head side=LOC           sit+remain-SIM.R.3 S.DS
        , . . . the old woman emerged from the coral head reef rock and while she
        was sitting next to it. . . '
    Although Korafe does not have any verb stems that have grammaticised as the indicator
of cause, iconically ordered verb sequences have the potential for encoding cause-and­
effect relationships. Example 5.45 illustrates one of the instances where an SVC manifests
this relationship. The stones used as the house' s foundation are both the object put in place
(jiti) and the subject of the verb vitira ' it ascended'.
5 .45   Dobo=da        tutumbi=mo, ghamana=i jiti vit-ira.
        shelter=LOC post=TIF           rock=CEFF put.! ascend.I-TP.3S.FN

relationship in Korafe, because cause and effect situations commonly involve a switch i n
subject i n which the object referent of the initial predicate becomes the referent of the
subject in the following predicate. In 5 .46 an SRC with the predicatesjighiri ambesi ' (who)
peformed (sorcery on you) and you died?' expresses cause and effect.

                COHESION, PROMINENCE AND DOMINANCE IN KORAFE
                            NARRATIVE DISCOURSES   In discussing relationships that underlie discourse, Grimes ( 1 975) distinguishes three
sets: ( 1 ) the cognitive and referential relationships that comprise content organisation, I (2)
cohesion relationships, ""which relate what is being said at the moment to what has been
said"" (p. l 1 2), and (3) staging relationships, ""which indicate the speaker' s perspective on
what is being said"" (p. l l 3).
   In Chapter 1 0, the focus was on the content organisation, in particular the organisational
strategies (chaining and thematic), the discourse rules and the information packaging used
in five types of Korafe discourses. In this chapter, we will examine cohesion and staging
relationships in Korafe narratives.
   Cohesion has to do with the establishment of links between units expressing significant
information in the discourse, such as themes, referents, and events. Cohesion is
progressively established by devices that maintain continuity . Section 1 1 . 1 outlines some
significant signals of continuity and discontinuity in Korafe narrative discourses.
   In constructing discourse, speakers commonly have in mind one or more of the
following questions: Who ' s important? Who' s in charge? What happened? When did it
happen? Where did it happen? Who did it? Why did it happen? Who will correct it? In
formulating discourse, they do more than keep track of participants, the actions they
perform, and the states they find themselves in. They impose their perspective on the
account, assigning relative prominence to participants and topics and making other thematic
or staging decisions. Section 1 1 .2 examines several of the devices used to register the
relative level of centrality and control attributed to each participant.
   The discussion in this chapter is drawn from a corpus of over 50 narrative texts.","[397, 398, 399, 400]"
"
3     The standard choices for number and person shifts that Usan and Kewa allow are documented by
      Reesink ( \ 987:20 1 -202).
220    Chapter 7   In Korafe, when first person occurs in the marking clause, the speaker is free to choose
the alternative. When the third person category shifts only in number between the two
clauses, both possibilities are also available to the speaker. However, when the second
person category shifts only in number between the two clauses, SS is used. 4 With all shifts
in the person category that do not involve first person in the marking clause, DS obligatorily
occurs.","[239, 240]"

                                                ,
   Both the conjunctions ° 'or' and ai/ai 'or } 1 are used to express alternatives. The
conjunction ° ' or' generally combines phrases, clauses, sentences or paragraphs that
express multiple alternatives, binary and n-ary (where n is any number greater than two).",[279]

IS
     The Korafe have long used the words takesi for 'tax', moni for 'money', gavana for 'government' and
     'government officer', and /rovensi for 'province'. Simon Peter Goto who gave this explanation is well­
     educated in English and used the words tax and gaveman rather than the customary Korafe
     transliterations, but I have used the transliterations here to show what the general population does. The
     convention of transliterating in the text and putting the English word in parentheses following it, e.g.
     raiyoni (lion), was used in the New Testament to cater to the Korafe preference to use English spelling
     in written texts. Other words, ' independence' and ' development', they insist on English spelling.

       verb or a topic comment construction. However, bases 1, 9, and 1 0 correspond to

   Evaluations which include the speaker' s commentary on ideas being presented and
defence of beliefs as well as reasons for taking a particular line of argument are expressed
in expositions. In expository discourses, the speaker merely presents his or her views as
statements of personal opinion, in contrast to hortatory discourses, where he or she gives
suggestions and issues commands. In example 1 0.4 1 , the author (a coastal Korafe speaker)
concludes a text detailing the lifestyle of a New Guinea Highlands man with this expression
of disbelief.

1 0.3 .2.3 HORTATORY DISCOURSES
   Hortatory discourses (viron u ) resemble exposItIons in that they are organised
thematically and contain sentences that are not ordered iconically and often terminate with
final verbs in different tenses. However, expository discourses are not punctuated with
commands, and their purpose is to clarify reasons for engaging in the events described,
explain points of information or give the speaker's viewpoint, etc. Hortatory discourses are
punctuated at various intervals (often at paragraph breaks) by value j udgments, commands,
suggestions using hortative forms and assertions. Evaluations in hortatory discourse are
designed to modify the addressee's thinking and/or behaviour. Example 1 0.42 contains
excerpts from Mackenzie Ruaba's plea to the church congregation to pay the evangelist's
salary. It gives only the Korafe text and the free translation.
1 0.42
1.     Gode amo makasi, kitakatako muturaera.
       ' God is a poor person, we give (him) very little indeed! '
2.     Father}o bagiakato iraeri. Father }o gungubokato iraeri.
       ' Father is not a thief. Father is not a liar.'
3.     Amo, namondeda darari. Jo maveda dara iraeri.
       'That (problem about the evangelist's pay) is our fault. It's not anyone else's fault. '
368    Chapter 1 0These evaluations are intended to shame the congregation, modify their beliefs about the
head priest and persuade them to alter their level of giving.
   Example 1 0.43 contains excerpts from the sermon Oscar Done delivered on the the
'wedding banquet' parable. Line ( 1 ) contains his introduction. The second excerpt follows
his outline of the parable. He initiates and punctuates each section with mild suggestions,
such as: kotarera 'we will think' and namonde ava kotarera 'we will think about that' . In
the final section of the sermon, he applies the parable to the parishioners' lives. He switches
from mild suggestions to rhetorical questions and commands (excerpts 3-7). His closing
command is the last excerpt. Only the Korafe text and the free translation are given in the
following excerpts.
1 0.43
1.     Oroko, Sunday nunda geka namonde kena ijugerira, kotarera.
       'Today, we will think (about what this) Sunday' s talk is teaching us.'
2.     Avori, namonde kasia ava ijugerira, namonde ava kotarera.
       ' All right, we will be thinking about those (things) that parable is teaching us.'
3.     Ninda embo boka eveva, ninda isia eveva, ambudo ainghae yaresa, ambaresa
       ainghae? Ava kote simbugarera.
       ' Will you die and go with your nice clothes, your succulent taro, will you die
       with it? We will think carefully about that.'
4.     Ni oroko ambaresa, evetu eveva, gagara eveva budD ainghae yaresa? Kote
       simbugevu! Ava sedo, God bufoa ambokenafitiove!
       ' If you die today, will you get your lovely wife (or) a pretty girl and go with her?
       Think carefully! Therefore, don't take God and put (him) last ! '
5.     /juga eni b u ojeni. Ava sedo, era 'darige yaone ' seose! God bufoa ambokena
       fitiose! God dombuda irare!
       ' I have brought (you) a teaching. Therefore, don't say, ""excuse me! "" Don't take God
       and put (him) last! Let God stay first (lit. in front)! '
6.     Aya afa, emboro esimbuguruvu, sasingu amboda sirore refirore!
       ' Mothers (and) fathers, be preparing the way well, (your) children born after
       (you) are coming along that way now.'
7.     Asisidae eSimbugarera, imemesiri win arera, sasingu win arera. Ava kote
       simbugevu!
       ' If we prepare thoroughly for our spirits, the grandchildren will come out ahead
       (lit. win), (and) the children will come out ahead (lit. win). Think about that! '
The above example was given during a church service with a formal structure set in place,
so the evangelist did not formally acknowledge the audience. At the onset of other orations,
such as the hortatory discourse given in Appendix 5, the various groups present in the
audience are specifically addressed.
                                                                    Introduction to Korale discourse       3691 0.3.2.4 LETTERS
   Personal letters have several features which distinguish them from other thematically
organised texts. They have five parts: ( 1 ) the formulaic aperture, (2) the introductory
greetings, (3) the body of the letter, (4) the concluding greetings, and (5) the closing, which
has the writer' s signature. The Korafe use this structure for writing personal letters to each
other. Business letters, they (or some knowledgeable person that they enlist) write in
English.
  The aperture for letters is an endearment address, Ariel kin relationship + name of
addressee ' (you are) esteemed,      _____
    The introductory greetings include enquiring about the recipient's health, his or her
family ' s health, and giving a rundown on the health of the people in the community. When
the Korafe ask their recipient to greet other people, they use the formulaic expression in
1 0.44.
1 0.44 Se                ning-arelning-orel
       say.IMP(2S.AQ) hear.I-H.3S.CR/hear.I-H.3PL.CR
       'Tell him/them (the news) so he hears (it)/they hear (it) ! '
   The Korafe often punctuate paragraphs, especially at the onset o f the letter, with a
formulaic expression that includes the perception verb, gi ' see, look at' :
1 0.45 Yari budD gif 1 6
       '(The letter) will go, receive (it) and look at (it) ! '
This form may be shortened to budD gi ' getting (it), look at (it) ! ' o r just gi ' look at (it) ' .
Trivial information is given first; the weighty important news is often saved until the last
paragraph.
   The concluding greetings are a shortened version of the initial greetings; they focus
primarily on the recipient and his or her family.
   The formulaic closing includes a short greeting in Korafe (I ' m greeting you again. ) or           'in English (e.g. 'Love,' , ' S incerely,') and the writer' s signature.
     An example of a Korafe letter is given in Appendix 6.","[385, 386, 387, 388, 389]"
"   Twenty-four years ago when my husband, our son Jamie and I went to Tufi, we did not
realise how deep our relationships with the Korafe people would go. They not only allowed
us to study their language; they welcomed us into their family! We appreciate the help and
generosity of all the Korafe and Mokorua people in the Tufi area, particularly the people of
Baga Village where we settled. We are deeply indebted to Justus and Rhoda and Brigitte
Seko, Kingsley and Barbara Seko, Dunstan and Zelma Seko, Michael and Magdalene Mota,
and Kenneth and Norris Mota, Erastus and Eleanora and Grace Mary Avo Daba, and
Demas and Molly Okena, and Patricia Kawoki and her husband, Cooper Samuel, and our
grandchildren, Wendy, Jeff, nunombo 'my namesake', and Junior, who have taken seriously
the family commitments they made to us. I appreciate the many insights into Korafe that

and Rhoda Isari, Newton Jau, Roland Otofia, Lucien Simati, Luke Nunisa, Bensted
Keghana, Evertius Yariyari, David Clark Furifuri, and Randall Simati have provided
throughout the years.
   For their continual encouragement, advice and correction, I am deeply indebted to
Dr T.E. Dutton and Professor A.K. Pawley, who supervised the preparation of the doctoral
dissertation on which this work is based. I have benefitted from the comments and
suggestions of Dr A.D. Andrews, Professor Talmy Giv6n, Professor Graham Scott, and

           SIKURU DA GEKA ' SPEECH ON PRIMARY SCHOOL MAINTENANCE'                                       by Kenneth Mota, age 50
                                              July 1 98 1   This hortatory discourse (vironu ' speech') is on the general topic of school maintenance,
in particular keeping the grass cut. As is customary for public speeches, the audience is
formally addressed. In this case, the speech is addressed to the general populace, the P . and
C. members, the school board members and the teachers.
   Kenneth resorts to commending, cajoling, pleading to their sense of fairness, and
threatening them with school closure.
    As is common in hortatory discourse, the final verbs occur in several different tense
forms. In spite of the fact that this is a hortatory discourse, not one imperative form is used.
The speaker relies on the second person plural contrafactual and future forms to frame his
commands politely. To drive his point home more forcefully, he uses a rhetorical question
in the fourth paragraph and evaluations in the third, fourth, and fifth paragraphs.
     The formulaic closing is typical of Korafe speeches.","[460, 461, 462, 463, 464]"
