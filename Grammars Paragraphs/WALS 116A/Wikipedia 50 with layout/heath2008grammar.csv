13.2.1 Clause-final interrogative particles13.2.1.1 Polar (yes/no) interrogative maThe polar interrogative clause-final particle is (atonal) ma. It is arguably
identical to the disjunctive particle ma ‘or’ (§7.2.1). If this equation is correct, it
raises the interesting question whether one sense (interrogative or disjunctive) is
basic. In German, oder ‘if’ is often added to a statement as a kind of polar tag
question marker: Du hast schon gegessen, oder? ‘you have already eaten, or?’.
If the disjunctive sense is taken as basic in Jamsay, then we have a possible
structural parallel to the German construction, functioning however as the basic
polar-question construction. Since the final ‘or’ (in this interpretation) is the
truncation of a fuller version of the (polarized) second clause (‘you have already
eaten, or [sc. you have not yet eaten]?’), this would account for the typical
nonterminal intonation of the Jamsay particle (see below). On the other hand, a
disjunction of the type ‘X or Y’ could be taken as a kind of question in many
contexts: compare ‘X or Y will come’ with ‘(I wonder whether) X will come,
(or) Y will come’. Moreover, many polar questions involve disjunctions: ‘Will
X or Y come?’.
     However, a complete identification of the polar-question and disjunctive
particles is doubtful. It will be seen below that ma is also optionally used after
WH-interrogatives, which are not interpretable as disjunctions.
     The Jamsay particle appears with variable pitch and duration. In my
interpretation, it is subject first to Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137),
which extends the preceding phonological tone into the particle, resulting in ma@
or ma$. Of these, ma$ is more common (at least at the end of full clauses), since
positive inflected verbs all end in L-tones. After this rule applies, the particle is
then frequently (but not obligatorily) subject to intonational modification, in
the form either of prolongation (), pitch-raising (), or both ().
     Whether intonationally raised or not, the pitch is often steady-state during
the articulation of the particle. However, I have occasionally observed a slowly
falling pitch that I indicate with symbols , similar to the dying-quail
intonation (symbol ).
     In polar interrogatives, the corresponding reverse-polarity statement, or
some other proposition contradicting the first, may also be added. In this case,
ma occurs minimally once, at the junction between the two propositions. The
prosodic grouping is variable, with ma often clearly grouped with the preceding

propositions.(759)     a. [n)a˘&   n)E@˘-sa$-w       ma$] [n)E˘$ -lu@˘-Ø]

             2004.4.5     ma may be repeated after the second alternative (760), though this option
did not occur in my texts. In this case, ma is clearly grouped prosodically with
the preceding segment. Perhaps examples like (760) are abbreviations of longer

tomorrow, or....’).(760)     i@je@  ma@,     yo$go@   ma@

‘if’ may be added. This makes sense when an overt quotative verb is present: ‘if

(762.b).

13.2.1.2 Tag-question (Negative la$˘)Negative la$˘, which is very common after ‘it is’ clitic y$ (§11.2.1.3), is also
used after a proposition-expressing clause, in (polarity-reversed) tag-question
function. One text, from an elderly man addressing a much younger interviewer,
was full of uptake-checking expressions, including (763).(763)   pa@˘mE@-r<a$-w<           la$˘

        ‘You-Sg understand, no?’ 2004.4.21    Another example from the same text is (764). Here the tag functions as a
rhetorical question, eliciting confirmation from the younger interlocutor.(764)   di ˘$ <    a$nsa@˘ra@  ka@r<-a@˘r<a$-Ø           ji ˘$ <

        ‘We saw how the whites used to do it, didn’t we? If we don’t abandon
        that, …’ 2004.4.23    A rhetorical tag question may also be expressed as a polarity-reversed
version of the initial proposition, reduced to its inflected verb. In (765), the
speaker bemoans the fact that young women of the village often go to cities to
work, and come back pregnant. The tag reverses the negative polarity of the
primary proposition.

4.7.1.1    ‘One’, ‘same (one)’, and ‘other’The numeral ‘1’ is tu@ru@. This form is used in counting, and as a postnominal
modifier to denote a single unit (in an unmarked context, as in answering a
‘how many?’ question): u@ro@ tu@ru@ ‘one house’. Unlike other numerals, which do
not take -n and -m suffixes, tu@ru@ often takes (human) Sg suffix -n when
modifying a human noun: dç$ƒç&-n tu@ru@-n ‘one Dogon’. tu@ru@ is also used in the
iterated distributive tu@t-tu@ru@ (syncopated from /tu@ru@-tu@ru@/) ‘one by one, one at
a time’ (§4.7.1.6, below).
     In the form tu@ru@, this numeral behaves like other numerals in requiring that
a preceding modified noun show its lexical tones. However, for paired body
parts (‘hand’, ‘foot’, ‘eye’, etc.), there is an alternative construction with
HL-toned tu@ru$ and all-L tone for the noun, as for nouns preceding ordinary
adjectives: E$nE@ ma$ nu$mo$ tu@ru$ ‘one of his hands (nu$mo@).
     tu@ru@ is not generally also used in the fashion of French un(e) and English
a(n) or some as an indefinite article, e.g. to introduce a new discourse referent.
Likewise, informants rejected plural #tu@ru@-m ‘ones’, with or without a
preceding plural noun.
     Another form, perhaps historically related to tu@ru@ in some way, is the
adjective tu@mno@, which can be glossed (in context) with preceding noun X as
‘(a) single X’, ‘(only) one X’, or ‘the same X’. Here the pragmatic nuance is
more emphatic, denying the possibility that a second X is relevant, or that the
original X has been replaced by another X.
     The adjective ‘other’ is la$ƒa@. It can be used either in the sense of
‘additional’ (as in ‘I already own one house, and want to buy another’), or in the
sense ‘alternative’ (as in ‘I don’t like my current house, I’m going to sell it and
buy another one’). As a pragmatic sentence-adverb with no modified noun, la$ƒa@
is common in the sense ‘furthermore’ or ‘in addition’.
     When a pair of entities or other nonsingular set has already been introduced
as a discourse referent, contrastive sequences of the type ‘one went, the other
(one) stayed here’ can be expressed by repeating the numeral ‘one’ in a
parallelistic construction (236).(236)     i@ne@-m     lE$y,   [ko@   n)a‡˘     ku$<] …

          ‘10’           pE@ru@     The lexical R-tone of numerals ‘2-5’, though heard in isolation (238.a),
drops to L-tone in normal speech when the numeral is NP-final and follows a
noun or other head (238.b). The R-tone is still heard in careful pronunciation in
elicited examples. The modified noun preceding the numeral has its regular
tones; there is no tone-dropping before a cardinal numeral. If Definite ku$< is
added, the R-tone is generally audible even in modifying function (238.c).(238)     a. lE&y               E@˘-sa$-m

suggests a syntactically appositional structure (§6.9). Further support for this
comes from the fact that when a [noun + numeral] combination is head of a
relative clause, the noun and the numeral undergo tone-dropping in parallel
(§14.1.3).","[205, 206, 207]"

13.2.3 ‘Whatchamacallit?’cE&˘ or ci $gE@ ‘thing’ is used as a ‘whatchamacallit?’ filler noun with nonhuman
reference, or as an adverbial. It is not a true interrogative morphosyntactically,
but it does have some similarity to self-directed questions, cf. French comment
dirais-je?(794)   [ga@˘w E$mE$    ya^˘-Ø]                cE&˘   na$˘-y<,

and chosiner ‘do whatchamacallit?’.
    An overtly self-directed question ‘how do they say it?’ (yç&˘-ji $n ga@-ba$) may
also be used as a ‘whatchamacallit?’ phrase.
    There is no simple inflectable verb with the sense ‘do/be whatchamacallit?’.
The phrase ci $gE@ ka@r<a@-, literally ‘do (a) thing’ is used.

13.2.4 Embedded interrogativesIn this section I consider interrogative complements to main-clause verbs like
‘know’, as in ‘I don’t know (whether/who/what …)’.
    An embedded polar interrogative clause (‘whether or not …’) is a simple
quotative complement (§17.1), plus the usual clause-final interrogative particle
ma. The particle distinguishes an embedded interrogative (‘I didn’t know
whether …’) from a factive complement (‘I didn’t know that …’), although the
Jamsay embedded interrogative construction may be used (as complement of
‘know’) where English would use the factive complement. Examples are in
(795).(795)     a. [u@   yE$rE^˘     ma$]    jE@     u@ju@ro@-sa$-ba$

where English speakers would use a factive complement. This is the case in
(796.a), above, which would more naturally be expressed as ‘… who knows that
it was I …’ in a free English translation.
    Embedded WH interrogatives may be of two types. In one, the regular
WH-word is used, with optional clause-final interrogative particle ma. This
type approximates direct discourse, except for deictic substitutions such as
logophoric pronominals, where appropriate (797).(797)   a. jE$yE@-tu$-ba$      ta@Na$˘     de$y,

           [how.much? pay.Perf.L-3PlSQ]       know-ImpfNeg-1SgS
           ‘I don’t know how much they paid.’     This type, with the regular WH-word, is preferred for embedded ‘how
much?’ and for embedded ‘who?’. In the first case, this may be for lack of a
suitable nominal counterpart (‘amount’, ‘quantity’). In the second, the
preference may be due to avoidance of ambiguity between e.g. ‘I don’t know
who lives here’ (identificational knowledge) versus ‘I don’t know the person
who lives here’ (acquaintance).
     The second possibility for embedded WH interrogatives is the literal type
exemplified by “I don’t know the place in which he is” as the translation of
English ‘I don’t know where he is.’ That is, a generic noun like ‘place’, ‘time’,
‘manner’, or ‘thing’ is the head of a relative clause, which (as a syntactic NP)
functions as direct object of ‘know’ or other main-clause verb. There is no overt
interrogative element.

14 Relativization
14.1 Basics of relative clausesThe basic relative clause pattern has an internal head NP (marked by tone-
dropping), and a participle agreeing in gender-number features with this head
NP (rather than an inflected verb agreeing in all pronominal features with the
clause subject). Modifying adjectives and cardinal numerals remain with the
internal head NP, but some other NP-final elements (e.g. Definite ku$<, Plural
be@, universal and distributive quantifiers) follow the participle. The participle
itself therefore behaves somewhat like an adjective modifying the head noun in
several respects (recall that modifying adjectives also force tone-dropping on
the modified noun, and precede the NP-final elements mentioned above).
     It is also possible to expand this core relative clause structure (ending with a
participle and perhaps one or two NP-final morphemes) by adding a copy of the
head noun (not the full head NP), as a special kind of external head.
Specifically, this copied noun is “possessed” by the relative-clause proper,
which functions here as the possessor NP (and is therefore followed by
Possessive ma$). The complete construction may be suggested (crudely) by a
structural paraphrase, whereby ‘a/the dog that I saw’ is expanded as as ‘dog of
[a/the big dog that I saw]’, though of course the linear order in Jamsay is very
different (with the external ‘dog’ at the end). The copied external head noun is
optional, and occurs in fewer than half of relative clauses occurring in my texts,
but it is nonetheless quite well-attested.
     The internal head NP is occasionally omitted, whether or not the external
head is present. This results in an internally headless relative. However, in
such cases it is reasonable to think of a “light” head noun (such as ‘person’,
‘thing’, ‘place’, ‘time’, or ‘manner’) as being virtually present, though
phonologically inaudible. Furthermore, the participle agrees with this virtual
head: (human) Singular, (human) Plural, or Nonhuman. We can therefore think
of the agreement morpheme on the participle as a stand-in for a full head NP,
just as subject-pronominal suffixation on the verb of a main clause can function
as “subject NP.”
     Thus the maximal relative-clause construction might be described as
double-headed. However, the Jamsay construction (when examined in detail) is
rather unique, and I question how useful it would be to assign it to a general
“double-headed” typological category.
480     Relativization
     Within the relative-clause proper, the head NP remains in situ, i.e. it is not
systematically extracted to either the left or the right of (the rest of) the clause.
The head noun often happens to be clause-initial (disregarding topicalized
constituents), as is true of nonpronominal NPs in general, but it need not be so.
     Relative clauses in Jamsay are not used for parenthetical comments, as in
English nonrestrictive relatives of the type I like John, who (by the way) is in
Texas right now.
     Jamsay relatives may be definite or indefinite. If definite (‘the man whom I
saw’), they presuppose that the propositional content of the clause is true, and
known to the listener, often by virtue of preceding discourse. Since the content
is presupposed, there is a high propability that core NPs other than the
relativized NP itself will appear in pronominal form. Since pronominals (if not
topicalized or emphatic) occur in immediately preverbal position, this typically
results in clause-initial position for the (internal) head NP. Indefinite relatives
(‘a/any man who can climb this hill’) characterize an unidentified or generic
referent by the relevant proposition, which may include new nonpronominal
discourse referents, so in such relatives the head NP have no unusual
association with clause-initial position.
     Some notable features of Jamsay relatives, in addition to the use of
participles and the arrangement of (internal and external) heads as outlined
above, are the use of preverbal L-toned subject pronominals in non-subject
relatives with no nonpronominal subject NP, and the application of a H(H…)L
tone overlay to unsuffixed Perfective verbs (which generally replace suffixed
positive Perfective verb forms).
     Some important spatiotemporal and manner clauses are simply relative
clauses with a noun like ‘day’ or ‘place, manner’ as (overt or covert) head.","[497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502]"

10.1.3.2 Negation of unreduplicated perfective-system verbsCorresponding to Perfective in -ti -$ , -yE$-/-ya$-, or -a^˘-, the unsuffixed Perfective,
the Resultative in -sa$-, and (usually) the Recent Perfect in -jE$- and the redup-
licated Perfective, there is a single unreduplicated Perfective Negative form
with suffix -li@-. There are some phonological interactions with pronominal-
subject suffixes (e.g. 2Sg -lu@˘-Ø, 1Pl -li@˘-Ø, 3Pl -l-a@, 1Sg -lu@-m, see §10.2.3,
below). The verb stem drops its tones to all-L.
     Examples of positive/negative correspondences are in (581). When the
negative verb is defocalized, for example in the presence of a focalized
constituent, tone-dropping applies, changing -li@- to -li $- (581.d).(581)          positive                     negative          a.   ya&˘-yE$-Ø                   ya$˘-li@-Ø

This combination did not occur in texts.

suffix (‘have you already searched’), where parallelism between the question
and the response is called for. In other contexts, ‘I have not searched’ would
appear in simple Perfective Negative form as lu$gu$ro$-lu@-m ‘I did not search’.
     PerfNeg -li@- does combine readily with the Experiental Perfect (‘have not
ever’). This is the usual way to express ‘never’. Here the Experiential Perfect
suffix -tE@rE$- is truncated to -tE- before -li@-, resulting in -tE$-li@-. The PerfNeg
suffix forces L-tone on both the ExpPf suffix and the preceding verb stem. The
irregularity in the form of -E@˘- ‘see’ with ExpPf suffix in the positive (E@t-tE@rE@-
instead of #E@˘-tE@rE@-) is carried over into the negative.(583)   positive                            negative        E@t-tE@rE$-w ‘you-Sg have seen’     E$t-tE$-lu@˘-Ø ‘you have never seen’
        a@ƒa@-tE@rE$-m ‘I have heard’       a$ƒa$-tE$-lu@-m ‘I have never heard’
10.1.3.3 Negation of reduplicated perfective-system verbsReduplicated perfectives cannot normally be directly negated.
     A reduplicated Perfective of a stative stance verb, e.g. i $-i@jE$- ‘be standing’,
is negated by adding the usual stative Negative suffix -la@- to the unreduplicated
stem, as in i j$ E$-la@-ba@ ‘they are not standing’. Likewise with adjectival verbs,
e.g. reduplicated positive ji -$ jo^˘- ‘be many’, negative jo$˘-la@- ‘not be many’.
     A reduplicated Perfective of an active verb, e.g. ti -$ tE@mE$-w< ‘you-Sg
found’, normally has a simple (unreduplicated) Perfective Negative counterpart:
tE$mE$-lu@˘-Ø ‘you-Sg did not find’. However, in parallelistic positive-negative
sequences, a reduplicated Perfective Negative is possible.
     For reduplicated Perfective ci -$ ce@˘ne$- ‘be well done, be good’, the normal
negative counterpart is the simple, unreduplicated Perfective Negative, as in
ce$˘ne$-li@-Ø ‘it is not well done, it is not good’. However, for this verb there is
also a parallelistic positive-negative construction, functioning as a “willy-nilly”
conditional antecedent (§16.3), that adds L-toned Negative -li $- to the
reduplicated Perfective stem (with no tone-dropping).

6.9     AppositionThe sequence core NP plus numeral is structurally appositional, unlike other
superficially similar sequences like noun plus modifying adjective (including
ordinals). In the case of [NP + numeral], both the final word in the core NP and
the numeral have their regular tones; in addition, the NP has its regular (human)
Sg or Pl suffix, as it would in the absence of the numeral. When the NP in
question is head of a relative clause, tone-dropping applies simultaneously to
the final word in the core NP (the noun, or a following modifying adjective) and
to the numeral. For details and examples, see §6.5, above, and §14.1.3.
     Apposition is also regular when a pronoun is “modified.” When a pronoun
(with human referent) is logically the head of a relative, it occurs to the left in
its independent (H-toned) form, in apposition to a form of i@ne@ ‘person’ which
follows. Only i@ne@ shows the tone-dropping characteristic of relative-clause
heads (397). I therefore bracket i@ne@ inside the relative clause, with the pronoun
outside the brackets. For more details, see §14.1.4.

             ‘I the person whom you-Sg know’    The same type of apposition is common when a pronoun is “modified” by a
numeral. The pronoun often appears in independent form, in apposition to a
number-marked form of i@ne@- ‘person’, which is directly juxtaposed to the
numeral (398.a). If the numeral is tu@ru@ ‘one’, when added to the proxy i@ne@-n
‘person’ it has Sg suffix -n (398.b). Numerals, especially ‘one’ and ‘two’, can
also be added directly to the pronoun with no suffix (398.c-d).(398)     a. e@   [i@ne@-m     lE$y]

ku@˘< ‘head’ to the equation. In (399), ku@˘< is the immediate complement of the
numeral. The 1Pl pronoun E@mE@ is leftmost, followed by i@ne@-m. Arguably this is
a three-way apposition between the pronoun, ‘person’, and ‘head’ (note the
absence of an overt Possessive morpheme between ‘person’ and ‘head’).

(400.a), u@ can only be analysed as an independent pronoun; contrast 2Sg
possessor a@ in e.g. a@ ç$ƒç&-n ‘your-Sg chief’. With pronouns other than 1Sg and
2Sg (which have special alienable possessor forms), there is no morphological
distinction between apposition and possession. Thus (400.b) could literally
mean ‘our Dogon people’ or ‘we (the) Dogon people’.(400)   a. u@        ç$ƒç&-n

7.1     NP coordinationThere is no basic conjunctive particle ‘and’, nor even a ‘with’ postposition used

19.2.4 ‘So, …’ (bE$y, hç@nç$)Another clause-initial discourse particle is bE$y. It is best translated as sentence-
initial ‘So now, …’. It occurs in the middle of conversations as a presentential
particle, set off with an intonation break. It occurs, for example, when the
speaker is ready to ask a follow-up question of the interlocutor, developing the
preceding discourse. The particle does not mean ‘so’ in the causal sense.(1158) a. bE$y,  [ya$˘ji@˘        pa@ƒa@-tu$˘-Ø]        n)E&-n

12.2.1 Predicative adjective with ji@n ‘like’One semantically symmetrical comparative involves ji@n ‘like’ following the
comparandum. A following predicative adjective is regularly L-toned

directly to the predicate adjective, with no ‘be’ quasi-verb.(738)   a. [mi@      ji@n]     gu$ru$-Ø

12.2.2 ‘(Not) particularly’ (-la$ƒa@)A construction of the type [ADJx-la$ƒa@ ADJx-Neg] is used with adjectives to
mean ‘it’s not very (not particularly) ADJ’. There is no overt comparandum,
and the construction merely emphasizes that the entity in question is only
moderately characterized by the quality. -la$ƒa@ is invariant, while the negated
second adjective may be conjugated. Since it is part of a bipartite construction,
it is difficult to gloss -la$ƒa@ precisely; I use ‘so.much’ in interlinears.(739)    a. gu$l-la$ƒa@          gu$l-la@-Ø

rejected a direct identification.2.4
12.2.3 ‘Equal; be as good as’ (ba&˘-)ba&˘- can function as a transitive verb meaning ‘suffice, be enough for (sb)’, in a
full range of perfective and imperfective forms: mi@ ba&˘kç$ ‘it’s enough for me’,
mi@ ba$˘-go@-Ø ‘it isn’t enough for me.’
     A homophone (or specialized offshoot) of this verb is used in comparatives,
in the perfective system only, in the sense ‘be as much as, equal’. It competes
with dç@˘- (do@˘-) ‘approach, attain’ in this sense; see §12.2.4, below. Unlike the
quasi-verbs and other stative verbs that are confined to the perfective system,
ba&˘- takes regular perfective system suffixes, including Resultative -sa$- and
Perfective Negative -li@- (rather than stative Negative -la@-). However, the
perfective forms are used for any time frame, and no morphologically
imperfective forms occur. For example, Imperfective Negative #ba$˘-go@- (in the
relevant sense) was rejected.
     ba&˘ may be chained to a following VP that expresses the substance of the
comparison. In the absence of such a VP, the default interpretation is ‘be as
good as’. In most examples, ba&˘ occurs in negative clauses (‘not equal X’ =
‘be/do less than X’), but it may occur in positive clauses as well (740.d).

13 Focalization and interrogation
13.1 FocalizationFocalization is a fundamental process in Jamsay morphosyntax, but it is
somewhat elusive. In the usual case, an NP or adverbial is highlighted
(focused), whereupon the remainder of the clause and in particular the verb is
automatically defocalized. I distinguish a marked focalization construction
from an unmarked one, based on the form of the highlighted constituent itself.
     In both marked and unmarked constructions, verbs in the perfective positive
appear in the unsuffixed Perfective form, with stem-wide L-tone, rather than in
a form with overt Perfective suffix. Perfective Negative and the Imperfective
Negative verbs also show stem-wide L-tone (including the AN suffix) in
focalization constructions. This tone-dropping may be interpreted iconically as
a prosodic manifestation of verb defocalization. No tone-dropping applies to
the unmarked Imperfective, or to any verb with overt positive AN suffixation.
     In subject focalization, there is no pronominal-subject suffix on the verb
(the subject is always expressed overtly earlier in the sentence). In all types of
non-subject focalization, the usual pronominal-subject suffix appears on the
verb.
     In the marked construction, in addition to the aforementioned defoc-
alization of perfective verbs, the focalized constituent hosts the Focus clitic y$,
or its allomorph i $˘ (sometimes i^˘ after tone sandhi). This clitic is also added
to NPs and other constituents in the ‘it is’ (i.e., copula) construction (§11.2.1).
As a result, the marked focalization construction resembles English clefts of the
type ‘it’s you (e.g. not that other woman) that I love’.
     In the unmarked construction, we get the verb defocalization described
above, and there is a focal constituent (e.g. ci@n ‘like that’), but the latter is not
overtly marked with the clitic y$.
     Since verb defocalization has audible effects on the stem only with per-
fective and negative verbs, and since the 3Sg pronominal-subject suffix is -Ø,
the unmarked focalization construction is indistinguishable from unfocalized
clauses when the verb is imperfective positive and the subject is 3Sg.
     Quite often in Jamsay discourse, a topic is presented first, followed by
sentence containing a pronominalized or otherwise reduced variant thereof in
focalized form. Schematic examples to give the flavor of this strategy: a) ‘meat,
that’s what I like’, b) ‘we sow seeds early, that’s how we farm’. Real examples
are in (744). In (744.a), the parallel segments are aligned. Note the absence of

13.1.1 Focalization of complement of y$ ‘it is’Although Focus clitic y$ is, to all appearances, morphologically identical to the
‘it is …’ form y$ (§11.2.1), it is possible for the two to co-occur. Compare the
ungrammaticality of English #It’s meat [focus] that it is, in contrast to the
grammatical Meat [focus] is what it is. In (745), the focused constituent is the
complement of the preposition ‘in’. The entire PP is the complement of the
external y$ ‘it is/was’. The construction is rare, but my assistant found it
grammatical.(745)   [ja@ma^˘y$     bE@rE$]y$        ta$Na$-Ø

13.1.2 Subject focalizationIn subject focalization, there is no subject pronominal suffix on the verb.
There is also no participial suffix of the sort found in relative clauses. This lack
of suffixation is a useful diagnostic, except for 3Sg subject which has -Ø suffix
anyway. The subject X is always overtly expressed earlier in the clause, either
as unmarked [X] or in the form [Xy$] with the Focus clitic. If the subject is
pronominal, it appears in preverbal position in its H-toned independent form,

3.7.3.4    Tone-Dissimilation (decimal numerals)Decimal numerals from ‘20’ to ‘90’ are composites of pE@ru@- ‘ten’ plus a single-
digit numeral. (132) presents data; for further discussion see §4.7.1.3.(132)        gloss           form          a. ‘10’            pE@ru@          b. ‘20’            pE@l-lE$y

             ‘90’            pE$l-la@˘ru@wa$ (or: pE$l-la@˘rwa$)    In ‘20’ through ‘50’, the single-digit numeral is really R-toned, though it
appears as L-toned when phrase-final but preceded by a compound initial or a
modified noun. In any event, these single-digit numerals (‘2’ to ‘5’) begin with
an L-tone component. On the other hand, numerals ‘6’ to ‘9’ begin with an
H-tone component.
    The unusual feature of the decimal numerals is that the tone of pE@ru@-
(reduced to pE@r- in ’20-50’ and in ‘90’ by Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) and then
subject to assimilation), is the opposite of the initial tone component of the
final. Since the underlying form is H-toned pE@ru@, we must recognize tone-
dropping in ’60-90’.
    I know of no other tone dissimilation process in Jamsay.
118     Phonology
(133)     Tone Dissimilation          In decimal numerals beginning with pE@ru@- ‘ten’, this morpheme drops
          its tones when the following single-digit numeral begins with an H-tone
3.7.3.5    Atonal-Morpheme Tone-SpreadingThere are a number of suffixes, with no intrinsic tone, that can be added to
nouns, adjectives, or verbs. The relevant phonological shapes are -Ø (zero), -C
(-n or -m, i.e. always a nasal), and syllabic -vC or -Cv.
     The nasals are phonologically straightforward for nouns and verbs, since
the relevant stems are vowel-final and the final vowels carry tones. These tones
are simply spread over the resulting bi- or trimoraic final syllable in a natural
way. If the tone is simple H or L, this pure tone just spreads to the nasal. If it is
a contour tone, the final tone component is realized on the nasal; see Contour-
Tone Stretching (143), below.
     There are two morphological combinations, however, where an atonal
syllabic suffix is added to a tone-specified stem (134).(134)     a. Sg -in or Pl -um after C-final adjective
          b. 3Pl -ba or 2Pl -be in inflected verb     In both cases, there are some issues involving stems with final contour tone;
these will be taken care of in connection with Final-Tone Resyllabification
(148). For present purposes it suffices to point out that the final tone of the stem
is spread into the previously atonal suffixal syllable. This is seen most clearly
when the final syllable of the unsuffixed stem is monotonal H or L. For adjec-
tives, only H-tone occurs (135.a). For verbs, both H- and L-tones can be
adduced (135.b-c).(135)     a. jE@m ‘black’
                 Sg jE@m-i@n, Pl jE@m-u@m          b. ya$˘- ‘go’ (unsuffixed Perfective of stem ya&˘-)
                  3Pl ya$˘-ba$, 2Pl ya$˘-be$          c. ya$˘-go@- ‘go’ (Imperfective Negative)
                  3Pl ya$˘-go@-ba@, 2Pl ya$˘-go@-be@     This process does not apply to 3Pl -ba and 2Pl -be in the unsuffixed Imper-
fective. In this case, Tone-Grafting (131) has already provided these suffixes
                                                                 3.7 Tones   119with a tone, by associating the L-tone (i.e. the segmentally zero morpheme
expressing the unsuffixed Imperfective) with the suffixal mora (stem-L-ba >
stem-ba$); see (130.a).
     The spreading of stem-tones onto an atonal suffix has analogues involving
certain clause-final particles, such as conditional-antecedent particle dey ‘if’
(136.a-b), interrogative ma (136.c-d) and quotative wa (136.e-f); cf. §3.7.1.8,
above. The last two may combine, in the order ma wa (136.g-h). The tonal
markings of the final particles in (136) are based on the most common pronun-
ciation in the absence of special intonational effects. Note that the particle(s)
carry forward the final tone of the preceding verb.(136)   a. n)a&˘    n)E@˘-jE$-Ø         de$y,    …

120   Phonology
      Clause-final particles other than Quotative wa are subject to intonational
modification (§3.8.1). dey occurs at the end of a conditional antecedent clause
that is immediately followed by its consequent clause. Interrogative ma
typically occurs in polar (yes/no) questions and is arguably identical to the ‘or’
conjunction ma, suggesting the possibility that questions like (136.c-d) are cut-
off interrogative disjunctions: ‘Did he/she eat, or [didn’t he/she eat]’. These
contexts for dey and ma lend themselves to nonterminal clause-final intonation,
in the form of prolongation () and/or raising (), which disguise the
(phonological) tone.
      A further complexity is that when two such clause-final particles co-occur,
they may form an autonomous prosodic unit independent of the preceding verb
(and its tones). For example, (136.g-h) show verb-final tones spreading from the
verb to both following particles, but in (136.g) it is also possible to raise the
pitch of both particles due to intonation effects. I transcribe this as e.g. n)a&˘
n)E@˘-jE$-Ø ma$ wa$ in the case of (136.g)
      The ‘if’ particle dey systematically appears as H-toned de@ in the
combinations de@ ke@ and de@ ne$, regardless of the tone of the preceding
morpheme (§16.1.3).
      Clause-final intonational effects can also apply to verbs ending in 3Pl -ba
and 2Pl -be (after they acquire a tone by Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading) in
the absence of a following particle. Moreover, when they occur in all-L-toned
words, under some conditions they (and other pronominal suffixes) may “grow”
a final H-tone; see §3.7.3.6, just below.
      Postposition le$ (instrumental, dative, locative) is normally L-toned (§8.2.1).
It has an H-toned variant le@ in certain fixed combinations, always involving a
preceding H-tone, suggesting that tone-spreading has applied in these combi-
nations. However, in cases like do@ju$ ‘under’, do@ju@ le@ ‘down below’, the
preceding word itself raises its final tone. We therefore have a chicken-and-egg
conundrum, and the tonal pattern of do@ju@ le@ does not lend itself to a simple
phonological interpretation (§3.7.1.8, §8.2.2).
      Likewise, there are three basically purposive clause types involving final le.
In one, we get H-toned le@ after tone-dropped verb, so there is clearly no tone-
spreading here (§17.6.1.1). In the other two, the tone of le is identical to that of
the preceding syllable. In one construction, the verb shifts to all-H tone, and is
followed by H-toned le@. In the other, we get L-toned le$ after an unsuffixed
Imperfective verb, which always ends in a L-toned component (final L or F
syllable). In these last two constructions, le acquires its tone by spreading from
the left (§17.6.1.2-3).
      We could therefore take certain cases of le (but not others) to be
intrinsically atonal and subject to the tone-spreading process.
                                                                      3.7 Tones   121(137)     Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading          a suffix or clause-final particle with no intrinsic tone acquires a tone by
          spreading from the final tone component of the preceding element
3.7.3.6    Pronominal-Suffix Tone-RaisingWhen an atonal pronominal-subject suffix is preceded by a verb (or verb plus
AN suffix) whose final tone component is L, the suffix normally gets L-tone by
Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137).
    However, in the unsuffixed Perfective, under some conditions the subject
suffix can spontaneously “grow” an H-tone. When they are asked to pronounce
unsuffixed Perfectives in isolation, informants frequently pronounced it with
suffixal H-tone, e.g. 1Sg la$ƒa$-m@, 2Pl la$ƒa$-be@. This H-tone was not observed in
texts when the unsuffixed Perfective is clause-final (as it usually is). However,
when it is followed by clitic y$ ‘it is’ or some other clause-final element, the
H-tone for syllabic suffixes was audible in several (though not all) textual
examples (138).(138)     a. [[ko@      bi@rE@] E@˘ me$y< ko$-ru@      yç$wç$-ba@y$

tç$jç$-ba@ ‘they paid’ in (797.d), and jE$yE$-be@ ‘you-Pl fight’ in (772).
      What might be going on here is that, under some morphosyntactic
conditions and in isolation, the Constraint Against All-L-Toned Stems (99) has
come into play, this time less systematically, and at word- rather than stem-
level. The principle is normally disregarded in clause-final unsuffixed Perfec-
122     Phonology
tives; see, for example, L-toned da$˘<-ba$ and da$˘<-y< in (690.a-b) and dozens of
similar examples. However, the constraint is activated in combination with clitic
y$ or other post-verbal morpheme, and in isolation pronunciations.
     The same speaker who gave (138.a), above, also raised the tone of y$ itself,
spoken as a single word in isolation, after the zero-suffix 3Sg verb form in
(139).(139)     yç$wç$-Øy@
          accept.Perf.L-3SgSit.is
          ‘(instead of) he/she accepting (it)’     To model this form, one might suggest adding a floating H-tone at the end
of the verb form (before the clitic), and allow the tone to be expressed audibly
on the clitic (in the absence of a mora-bearing suffixal segment).
     If this analysis is correct, the occasional H-toned pronominal-subject suffix
(following an L-toned stem) does not represent the underying tone of the suffix,
rather is due to an inconsistently applied phonoloigical process based on the
constraint mentioned.
     However, the constraint does not affect unsuffixed Perfectives with zero
(3Sg) suffix, so e.g. yç$wç$-Ø ‘he/she accepted’ and da$˘<-Ø ‘he/she is sitting’ are
L-toned in all environments, including in isolation; one does not hear e.g.
#yç$wç@-Ø as an unsuffixed Perfective. This is evidence against a purely phono-
logical interpretation, attributing the unexpected suffixal H-tones in (138) to a
constraint against all-L words. This would suggest that the unexpected suffixal
H-tones are instead the result of a morphologically restricted tone-dissimilation
by which an atonal suffix following an all-L-toned verb may appear as H-toned.
     In some textual passages, one is initially tempted to recognize a suffixal
H-tone, but one senses that the pitch rise may be intonational in nature. For
example, in the passage (193), the 3Pl unsuffixed Perfectives (each ending a
clause) are …ba$ra$-ba$, … cE$˘<-ba$, … de$˘-ba$, and … de$˘-ba$. The suffixal
pitch is higher on the second and third of these. I attribute this as the  clause-
final intonation based on my interpretation of the discourse structure of the
passage. However, one could argue that the (optional) suffixal tone-raising
process has shifted /-ba$/ to -ba@ in the relevant forms.","[139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"
"
15.1 ChainingThe term “chaining” will be used for combinations of VPs (sometimes reduced
to simple verbs), such that the nonfinal verbs occur in infinitival (=bare stem)
form with their lexical tone, which depending on the verb is either all-H or
L(L…)H. The VPs in question have a shared subject, which facilitates the
reduction of one clause to just a VP. The final verb in a chain is inflected for
aspect-negation categories, and usually for subject pronominal category.
     Chaining covers a range of phenomena involving various degrees of
integration. At one extreme, we have two or more completely separate VPs
chained together, sharing a subject and implying some sort of temporal or
causal relationships, but with no other formal clause-level integration. At the
other extreme, we have a kind of verb-verb compounding, where a pair of verbs
functions like a single verb, with a single set of arguments and adverbial com-
plements.
     Closely related to VP-chaining in form and function is a VP-linking
construction with particle me$y< (§15.1.14, below). There is also a similarity to
constructions with main-clause verbs like ‘want’ that take complements in the
form of VPs ending in bare stems (§17.5).",[542]

19.1.3 ‘Also, even’ (ka^˘<, ka@r<a$)The morpheme meaning ‘also, too’ (see below for ‘even’) is usually heard as
ka^˘<, which can easily be confused with the distributive quantifier ka^˘< ‘each,
any’. However, the particle meaning ‘also’ has a variant ka@r<a$ that is not shared
with the quantifier. In addition, the ‘each, any’ quantifier occurs in a more
limited set of morphosyntactic combinations, e.g. with a preceding unmodified
noun or a preceding relative clause, and it induces tone-dropping in the
preceding word (§6.1.4, §6.8.1). The ‘also, even’ particle occurs after a wide
range of phrases and clause-finally, and has no tonal effect on a preceding
word.
     ka^˘< and ka@r<a$ variants are interchangeable. However, ka@r<a$ seems to
occur chiefly after a pronoun or other NP. ka^˘< is more common in all positions,
but seems especially dominant in clause-final position (with clausal scope), and
in the high-frequency combination ka^˘< nE$ with nE$ ‘now’. The variant ka@r<a$
should be distinguished from the common verb ka@r<a@- ‘do’, which appears as
the form ka@r<a$-Ø in perfective relative clauses with Nonhuman head NP.
     For examples of ka^˘< in the sense ‘also, too’ see (217), (280.b), (435.c),
(556.a), (641), (671.b), (740.b), (749), (795.b), etc. For ka@r<a$ in this sense see
(315.b), (1152.a-b).
     The constituent that the ‘also’ particle has scope over is not always topical,
but it may be (1152).(1152) a. [n)E&˘-r<-u$m        ka@r<a$], a$ra@      nç$˘-w<ç@-n         de@y, …

in the same text as mi@ ka^˘<.
     The sense ‘also’ is closely related to that of ‘even’, the only difference
being that ‘even’ presupposes the unlikelihood of one out of two (or more)
parallel events differing in at least one substantive component. The distinction is
made in English but not in Jamsay, where ka^˘< and ka@r<a$ may be translated
either way depending on context. The choice of translations is fairly arbitrary in
cases like ‘even today’ (= ‘today too’) following a discussion of past practices
(1153.a). The sense ‘even’ may be reinforced by ha^l ‘until, to the point that’

"A single overt head NP may occur in a construction involving two or more
relative clauses, i.e. in a conjoined relative of the type ‘the man [[who went
there] and [who took the horse]]’. (Of course this is distinct from conjunction of
two referentially distinct NPs with relatives: ‘[the man who came] and [the
woman who stayed]’).
     In (805.a-c), there is no overt conjunctive particle linking the clauses, which
is to be expected since a) Jamsay relative clauses are morphosyntactically
nominal (participles have nominal suffixation), and b) conjunction of NPs in
Jamsay is generally expressed by juxtaposition without overt conjunctions
(§7.1.1). The head NP appears overtly once, in the first relative clause. One
might argue that a zeroed copy of the head NP is (virtually but not audibly)
present in the succeeding relative clauses. In a conjoined relative of this type,
the truth conditions of all of the relatives must be satisfied for the overall NP to
484     Relativization
refer properly. In (805.a), the two relatives denote two propositions, one of
which (the negative second proposition) is entailed by the other. In (805.b), the
first relative denotes a primary action, while the second is a higher-level
proposition (‘of whom you are aware’). This example is also interesting in that
the (shared) head NP is the subject in one clause and the object in the other.(805)     a.. [a$r<-u$m     ta$ra@            ya$˘-lu@-m]

             ‘There are people who have fought with an elephant, (people) of
             whom you are aware.’ 2004.3.4     The conjoined-relative construction competes with an alternative where,
given several consecutive VP’s with a shared subject NP, the final VP contains
a participle while all the preceding VP’s are in chaining form (§14.1.15). This
alternative would work easily in (805.a), where the head NP is subject of both
clauses, but less easily in (805.b), where this is not the case.
     A disjunctive relative clause of the same type is possible (806). The
disjuncts are followed by ma ‘or’ (§7.2).(806)     [i $ne$   ni $-di^˘< n)E@˘-r<a$-m     ma$] [nç&˘-r<a$-m         ma$]

          ‘the people who eat here or (who) drink here’     One relative clause may be embedded within another (recursive or stacked
relatives). In this construction, the higher relative clause contains an NP (not the
higher head NP) that is itself expanded with a relative clause. The resulting
center-embedded construction is awkward in production and processing terms
and did not occur in my texts, but it is entirely grammatical and was readily
elicited. The left edge of the lower relative clause is normally marked
prosodically, as the preceding word shows prepausal prosody. This is most
often expressed by a brief pause, represented by a comma, since an inton-
ationally determined terminal pitch drop might not be audible (the word in
question is often the final word of the higher head NP and is therefore already

center-embedded construction is at hand, and is therefore helpful in preventing
misparsing. The right edge of the lower relative may also be marked prosod-
ically in the same ways, but this is less systematic, since the right edge is in
most cases already clearly marked morphologically (e.g. by a participle, perhaps
with a following Definite morpheme or other NP-final element). Thus, in
(807.a), a$-n ‘man’ (word preceding the left edge of the lower relative) and
(optionally) Definite ku$< (final word in the lower relative, i.e. word preceding
the latter’s right edge) have prepausal prosody (final pitch drop and/or brief
pause). The formating in (807) indents the lower relative, and bolds the higher
and lower heads in the interlinears.(807)   a. [a$-n,

14.1.3 Tone-dropping on final word(s) of NP in relative clauseRelative clauses are most reliably identified by observing tone-dropping on the
final word in the head NP. This word would otherwise have at least one
H-tone, but it appears in relatives with all-L tones.
     If the head NP (disregarding alienable possessors) consists of multiple
words, its nonfinal word(s) may already have become L-toned by tone-dropping
triggered by a following modifier (adjective or demonstrative). However, there
are some NP types that end in two (rarely more) words, each of which has at
least one H-tone. When such an NP functions as relative clause head, tone-
dropping applies simultaneously to the relevant words. The combinations in
486     Relativization
question are [noun + (cardinal) numeral] (§6.5), and inalienably possessed
nouns with nonpronominal possessor (§6.2.2).
    The audible tone-dropping patterns for relative-clause heads are
summarized in (808). Please read the “key” underneath.","[505, 506, 507, 508]"

1.1   Dogon languagesDogon is a family of languages spoken principally in eastern Mali, though some
Dogon groups have spread across the border into Burkina Faso. As a whole, the
family belongs to the vast Niger-Congo phylum, but its precise position relative
to other Niger-Congo families (e.g. Mande, Gur) is very unclear at this point.
The internal structure of the Dogon family is also very unclear, as is the number
of mutually unintelligible languages it contains.
     The French colonial administration, having little interest in small native
languages, favored (macro-)ethnic over (precise) linguistic classification, hence
“Dogon” rather than e.g. “Jamsay,” and labeled linguistic varieties within each
such macro-ethnicity as “dialects,” a tradition maintained even in current
Francophone scholarship. For similar reasons, (macro-)ethnic classification
suits African governments fine. The official language policy in Mali, for
example, is to equate “language” with (macro-)ethnicity, select the linguistic
variety spoken in a particular focal community as standard, develop pedagogical
materials in this variety, and teach it as “mother tongue” to schoolchildren and
interested adults everywhere who belong to this ethnicity. In the case of Dogon,
the Toro-So variety of the Sanga area was chosen as standard Dogon and is the
basis of government-approved literacy efforts in the region.
     Using the test of mutual unintelligibility as diagnostic, on the other hand,
there are clearly many distinct Dogon languages in Mali. We do not yet have
Dogon-wide data in a form that would permit demarcation of language
boundaries and accurate genetic subgroupings. However, having surveyed the
varieties spoken in the northern and northeastern parts of Dogon country, I can
report the following as distinct languages, using the towns of Dountza and Boni
(primarily Fulfulde-speaking) and Koro (Dogon and Mossi) as geographical
reference points:
1. Jamsay (aka Diamsay), see below;
2. Beni, spoken in Beni and Gamni south of Dianwely Maoudé, and in
Kumboy village hugging Fombori mountain between Beni and Douentza;
3. Walo, close genetically to Beni, spoken in Walo at the western end of the
long Gandamiya inselberg (on the opposite side of which is Kikara, where the
Songhay language Tondi Songway Kiini is spoken);
4. Nanga (naNa), spoken in a village cluster including Anda, Soroni,
Namakoro, Wakara, and Kono southwest of Beni and broadly east of the
2 IntroductionTommo-So (Tombo-So) speaking zone that begins at Kasa and extends to
Bandiagara;
5. Tabi-Sarinyere, spoken by the people sometimes called Tandam, east of the
town Boni (which is just off the highway, between Douentza and Hombori), in
several villages ringing the widely separated inselbergs of Tabi and Sarinyere,
plus a few small villages and one substantial one (Koyo) on the two inselbergs
framing Boni itself;
6. Najamba (= Bondu), spoken in a cluster of villages west and southwest of
Douentza including Koubewel, Adia.
     After the initial failure of government-supported instruction in Toro-So in
Dogon villages of the Douentza-Boni zone, local groups have launched literacy
programs in Jamsay and Bondu and these are now being taught in primary
schools. Aside from its own mother-tongue villages, Jamsay is being taught in
the Tabi area (whose people have long known Jamsay as a second language,
since Mondoro is not far away). The children of Beni have been attending
school in Jamsay-speaking Dianwely Maoudé, where Jamsay is of course used,
pending the construction of its own school. Jamsay is slowly acquiring the
status of a locally dominant “standard” Dogon in the Douentza-Boni region.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

10.1.2.3 Marked Perfective (-ti $-, -yE$-/-ya$-, -a^˘-)The suffixal (=marked) Perfective is used in positive main clauses where the
verb is not defocalized. The suffixed Perfective is almost always replaced by the
unsuffixed Perfective in relative clauses and related subordinated clauses.
       There are two basic morphological types of Perfective (positive), one with
-ti -$ and one with -yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘-. The first is always a classic perfective, while
the second can be interpreted either as perfective in the same classic sense, or as
a resultative-stative.
       The choice between the two major Perfective types depends chiefly on the
transitivity and (especially among intransitives) on the semantic type of the
verb. The division is summarized in (552). For perception verbs, which do not
readily co-occur with either Perfective suffix allomorph, see §10.1.2.4.(552)    -ti -$                        most transitives
                                       active intransitives         -yE$-/-ya$-, -a^˘-            a few weak transitives (‘resemble’, ‘forget’)
                                       (basically intransitive) motion verbs
                                       (basically intransitive) stance verbs
                                       intransitive (inchoative) adjectival verbs
                                       other intransitive stative verbs
348     Verbal inflection
      Examples of verbs taking -ti $- are: a) classic transitives cE@jE@- ‘cut’
(cE@jE@-ti -$ ), de$ne@- ‘want, love’ (de$ne@-ti -$ ), pa@ƒa@- ‘tie’ (pa@ƒa@-ti $-); and b) active
intransitives plus weak transitives that regularly take fixed “objects” such as
cognate nominals (gç@lç@rç@) dç$n)ç@- ‘snore’ (dç$n)ç@-ti -$ ), (ni@˘) i n            $ e@- ‘bathe’
(i n
   $ e@-ti-), mç$w<ç@- ‘laugh’ (mç$w<ç@-ti -$ ), te@ge@- ‘speak’ (te@ge@-ti $), yi n            $ e@-
‘breathe’ (yi n   $ e@-ti -$ ), and pe@re@- ‘jump’ (pe@t-ti -$ , but with variant pe@y-ya$-).
      I have no clear idea as to the origin of -ti -$ . It most likely has a common
history with ti@ as a linker (indicating a sequential chronological relationship)
among chained verbs (§15.1.16). There is some possibility of a more distant
connection with the transitive verb ti@˘- ‘send’.
      The choice between -yE$-/-ya$- on the one hand and -a^˘- on the other is based
on the phonological form of the verb, as summarized in (553). Variation
between -yE$- and -ya$- is free; both occurred in my tapes in the speech of
individual informants, and it was often difficult to distinguish them.(553)     a. -yE$-/-ya$-

               nonsyncopating bisyllabic stems
               trisyllabic and longer stems     The allomorph -yE$-/-ya$- perhaps derives historically from ya&˘- ‘go’. Indeed,
many of the verbs taking -yE$-/-ya$- are motion verbs. It seems unlikely that
allomorph -a^˘- is historically related to the phonologically similar verb a@˘-
‘catch’, but -a^˘- might have some historical connection to (the onset of) the
Habitual suffix -a@˘ra$- in the imperfective system.
     Monosyllabic stems with -yE$-/-ya$- include dç@˘- ‘arrive, reach’ (dç@˘-ya$-),
go@˘- ‘go out’ (go@˘-ya$-), be@˘- ‘stay, live’ (be@˘-ya$-), ni@˘- ‘sleep’ (ni@˘-y<a$-), na@˘-
‘pass the night’ (na@˘-y<a$-), and ya&˘- ‘go’ (ya&˘-ya$-).
     Syncopating bisyllabic stems (those of shape Cvrv- or Cvr<v- ) that take
-yE$-/-ya$- include yE$rE@- ‘come’ (ye&y-ya$-), ga$ra@- ‘pass by’ (ga&y-ya$-), lo@ro@- ‘get
pregnant’ (lo@y-ya$-), ba$r<a@- ‘become red’ (ba&y<-ya$-), mç$r<ç@- ‘come together’
(mç&y<-y<a$-), and u$rç@- ‘go up’ (u&y-ya$-). On Post-Sonorant Syncope (60), which
(with two exceptions not relevant to this section) applies only to CvCv- stems
with short vowels and with medial rhotic r or r<, see §3.5.3.2.
     Nonsyncopating bisyllabics with -a^˘- include na@Na@- ‘forget’ (na@N-a^˘-),
ti@me@- ‘resemble’ (ti@m-a^˘-), nu$mo@- ‘fall’ (nu$m-a^˘-), su$go@- (su$g-a^˘-), di N      $ e@- ‘sit

(do$n)-a^˘-).
      Trisyllabic examples are ko@mo@n)o@- ‘became wrinkled’ (ko@mo@n-) a^˘-),
na@Na@-r<a@- ‘remember’ = reversive of ‘forget’ (na@Na@-r<-a^˘-), and ba$na$-r<a@-
‘become red’ (ba$na$-r<a^˘-).
      The rare combination of-yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘- with a syntactically transitive verb
is illustrated in (554). The few verbs in question are the very epitomes of wimpy
transitivity.(554)    a. mi@        ti@m-a^˘-Ø
            1SgO       resemble-Perf-3SgS
            ‘He/She resembled (=came to resemble) me’         b. u@         na@N-a^˘-ba$
            2SgO       forget-Perf-3PlS
            ‘They have forgotten you-Sg.’         c. mi@       na@Na@-r<-a^˘-ba$
            1SgO      forget-Revers-Perf-3PlS
            ‘They remember me.’     Non-adjectival verbs denoting state-like processes, such as ‘sleep’, lend
themselves to either the (classic) perfective or the stative-resultative reading.
Thus ni@˘-y<a$-Ø can mean ‘he/she went to sleep’ (perfective, event completed
before time of reference), or ‘he/she is sleeping’ (stative-resultative, state
continuing into the present). Motion verbs favor the straight perfective reading,
though of course a completed motion event also creates a state. Thus go@˘-ya$-Ø
‘he/she went out’, contextually also ‘… has gone out’ = ‘… is out, is not here’.
Adjectival stative verbs also favor the perfective (in this case inchoative)
reading, e.g. ‘became red’, but for a different reason, viz., the adjective itself is
used predicatively to denote a timeless state: predicate adjective ba@nkç$ ‘it is
red’, intransitive perfective ba$na$-r<-a^˘-Ø ‘it became red’ or ‘… has become
red’.
     The fact that the Perfective suffixes can differentiate transitive and
(intransitive) stative verbs makes it easier to understand why Jamsay has so
many ambi-valent stems that can be transitive or intransitive. For example,
do@mno@- ‘finish’ has two Perfective forms, each associated with a particular
valency: do@mno@-ti -$ in transitive function (‘X finished Y’), but do@mn-a^˘- in
intransitive function (‘Y came to an end’). Likewise, with an inchoative-
factitive pair of deadjectival verbs, du$gu$-no@-ti -$ must be interpreted as tran-
sitive factitive ‘X fattened Y’, while du$gu$-n-a^˘- can only be intransitive
inchoative ‘Y became fat’.

10.1.2.4 Resultative (-sa$-)This suffix is added to a verb stem that has its regular (lexical) tones. The suffix
may well have a historical connection to quasi-verb sa$- ‘have’ (§11.5.1) and/or
with the clause-chaining verb sa^˘-Ø (§15.1.15).
                                      10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs   351    I use the label “Resultative” with misgivings. This is not a classic stative
resultative. That sense can be expressed by the marked Perfective (particularly
the allomorphs -yE$-/-ya$- and -a^˘-). The nuance with -sa$- suffix seems rather to
be this: the fact that the event that has taken place is of some continuing
relevance.
    One empirical observation is that -sa$- is the regular positive perfective-
system form of perception verbs E@˘- ‘see’ and a@ƒa@- ‘hear’. These verbs cannot
take Perfective -yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘-, and informants showed considerable aversion
to combining them with Perfective -ti $ -. Except for Experiential Perfect -tE@rE$- in
the sense ‘have (n)ever seen/heard’, these verbs consistently appear with -sa$- in
perfective contexts. Cognitively, what distinguishes perception verbs from most
other verbs is that the agent (seer, hearer) rather than the patient (object seen or
heard) is altered by the act of perception. One can think of ‘X see/hear Y’ as an
event that results in a cognitive state in the perceiver.(556)   a. [ko@    ku$<     ka^˘<]    a@ƒa@-sa$-m

           ‘Now I’ve seen that the millet stem has stopped growing.’     A second observation is that -sa$- is very common with active (i.e. non-
stative) verbs in conditional antecedents, before dey ‘if’ or its syntactic
equivalents. Here the “continuing” relevance of the -sa$- eventuality is causal in
nature, and is terminated when the contingent eventuality is brought about.(557)   a. ya@˘gi@nE@-sa$-Ø,             ya@˘gE$        yE@ sa$-Ø       ta@n,

6.3.3.4    ‘Near X’, ‘far from X’Certain morphological adjectives that can be expanded phrasally. We start with
‘near’ and ‘far’ here, then consider adjectives of evaluation in the following
section. Other concepts that come to mind typologically, such as ‘be angry [at
X]’ and ‘be afraid [of X]’, are expressed in Jamsay by verbs rather than by
adjectives.
    Both ‘near’ and ‘far’ are adjectives that can take locative-adverb
complements. The complement immediately precedes the adjective.
    e@˘N ‘near’ has locative PP (or tonal locative) complements in (361). In
(361.a), the adjective is followed by the ‘it is’ clitic; we infer the presence of a
zero head noun with spatial sense (‘if it’s [(a place) [near (to) this place]]’). In
(361.b), the adjective modifies an overt noun (‘village’), which is therefore
L-toned even though separated from the adjective by the expansion of the
adjectival phrase. In (361.c), the adjective is predicative.(361)     a. [[di $˘<      nu@No$] le$] e@˘Ni^˘

             ‘The market is close to the house.’     In (362), ‘water’ rather than ‘village’ is the subject of ‘near’. The
construction is actually a relative clause with ‘village’ as head. Exceptionally,
‘villages’ is treated as (human) plural here, perhaps since ‘village’ is often used
in the sense ‘population of the village’.(362)     [a$na$        [ni@˘     e@˘N-u$m]]

6.4     Noun plus demonstrative6.4.1    Prenominal ko$Rarely, an L-toned ko$ preceding a noun can be the Nonhuman L-toned
inalienable possessor form, in unusual combinations like ‘its father’. Much
more often, prenominal ko$ is a general discourse-definite ‘that (same)’
demonstrative with any noun (§4.2.2.A). Most textual examples involve
alienable nouns that cannot take L-toned possessor pronominals (367).(367)    a. ko$         u@ro@

            ‘those two (same) neighborhoods’ 2004.4.6   Demonstrative ko$ is compatible with a preceding (alienable) possessor
modifying the same noun, as in (368).

          2SgP      Dem house
          ‘that (aforementioned) house of yours’     However, ko$ is not compatible with an inalienable possessor, suggesting
that it still occurs in the same linear “slot” as such possessors (in keeping with
its probable original morphemic identity to the Nonhuman inalienable possessor
ko$). Thus (369) was rejected by my assistant.(369)     #u$       ko$    de^˘

6.4.2     Postnominal nu@No$A deictic demonstrative sense ‘this, that’ is expressed by adding Nonhuman
nu@No$, human Sg nu$No$-ba^˘<, or human Pl nu$No$-na@m to the noun. For the forms,
see §4.4.1.1. A preceding modified noun drops its tones to all-L, showing that
nu@No$ patterns in this respect as an adjective.(370)     a. u$ro$        nu@No$

6.5     Noun plus cardinal numeralCardinal numerals do not induce tone-dropping on a preceding noun (or other
preceding NP constituent such as an adjective).(371)     a. u@ro@       nu$˘y<
             house       five
             ‘five houses’

           [house.L good]         five
           ‘five nice houses’     In (371.b), u$ro$ has L-tone because it is followed by an adjective, not
because of the phrase-final numeral. In (371.a-b), nu&˘y< ‘five’ is one of the
lexically R-toned numerals, which are optionally (but often) heard with L-tone
when they occur the end of a phrase. The R-tone of nu&˘y< is audible before
clitics and nonfinally in phrases, as for example in (395.a-b).
     When a combination like (371.a-b) functions as head NP in a relative, both
the numeral and the preceding lexical-toned word drop their tones in parallel
(§14.1.3). In general, [noun + numeral] combinations appear to be syntactically
appositional (symmetrical) rather than hierarchical (asymmetrical).
     Human nouns take their regular Pl suffix -m in combination with a cardinal
numeral. Likewise, a noun with (human) Sg suffix -n keeps it before tu@ru@ ‘1’
(which itself has human Sg form tu@ru@-n).(372)   a. i@ne@-m     nu$˘y<
           person-Pl five
           ‘five people’        b. [i $ne$-m     mç$n)u@-m] nu$˘y<

           Dogon-Sg one-Sg
           ‘one Dogon’     When a cardinal numeral follows a combination of noun plus
demonstrative (whether the latter is pre- or postnominal), the expression is
interpreted as nonpartitive. That is, the group in question is either ostensively
indicated (373.a) or discourse-definite (373.b).(373)   a. [gu$-gu$n            nu@No$ nu$˘y<]       E@wE@-y$

           ‘We’ll buy those (aforementioned) five watermelons.’
254     Noun phrase structure
    For partitive sense, an explicit partitive construction must be used. This
construction includes an initial “locational” with a postposition such as ga&nn$
‘between, among’ (§8.3.12) or bE$rE^˘ ‘in’ (\§8.3.3) containing the demonstrative.
The noun in question is resumed within the core clause that follows (374).
Compare (787.e) in §13.2.2.6.(374)     [gu$-gu$n            nu@No$ ma$      ga&nn$],

        Plural (bThe Plural particle be@ is related to 3Pl pronoun be@, and it is part of Logophoric
Pl pronoun E$nE@ be@. However, be@ has fairly low text frequency in Pl function in
nonpronominal (i.e. noun-headed) NPs. Most native Dogon human nouns can
take Sg -n and Pl -m, and the suffix preempts the need for a Plural particle.
However, most inalienable kin terms do not allow Sg -n or Pl -m suffixes, and
these do rely on be@ to express plurality: mi $ yE@s a^˘ ‘my (man’s) sister’, plural
mi $ yE@s a^˘ be@ ‘my sisters’. Other examples of nouns with Pl be@ are ja$msa&y be@
‘Jamsay (people)’ and borrowed nouns like conseiller be@ ‘councilors’ and
aventurier be@ ‘adventurers’.
     For nonhuman nouns, plurality is an optional category and is usually not
expressed. However, Pl be@ is available when the speaker chooses to express
plurality overtly: i j$ u@ be@ ‘dogs’, versus simple i $ju@ ‘dog(s)’. Examples involving
inanimate nouns are in (375).(375)     a. [[ko@    ku$<] ma$ a$-ti^˘]           ma$ tç&g       ku$<     be@

19.1 TopicJamsay discourse has many NPs (and adverbials) that precede the verb and any
preverbal subject or object pronominals. Many of these are best analysed as
topical expressions, and as we will see just below this status is sometimes
explicitly marked by a particle.
     The issue arises whether a topical NP at the beginning of an utterance is
pre-clausal or clause-internal. The clearest indication that a topical NP is pre-
clausal is when it s resumed by a pronominal (other than a pronominal-subject
suffix on the verb, which is obligatory in any event) in the clause proper. This
test is available for all non-subject categories such as direct object, post-
positional complement, or possessor of any NP. In addition, a pre-clausal
topical NP is often prosodically set off (as indicated by a comma).
     In (1147), the fact that topical [ko$ ke@] is sandwiched between sa@bu$ and the
rest of the clause, and the fact that Nonhuman ko$ is not resumed by a further
object pronominal ko@, suggest that the topical phrase is clause-internal.(1147) sa@bu$      [ko$      ke@]     tç$˘-j-e@

7.1.1.4    Conjunction with final quantifierInfrequently, an NP conjunction ends with a quantifier that expresses the
summed cardinality of the two conjuncts. In most such examples, the quantifier
is the numeral ‘two’, as in (416).(416)     ma^˘n      [[[u@      ma^˘n            lE&y]  ma$ ga&nn$]

7.1.1.5    Conflict between dying-quail intonation and syntactic tone-droppingThe question arises whether dying-quail intonation in conjunction can survive in
a morphosyntactic context that requires tone-dropping (i.e. flat, low pitch). The
issue does not arise in connection with noun-adjective sequences, since e.g. ‘big
dogs and big cats’ does not reduce (in Jamsay) to ‘big [dogs and cats]’, where
the adjective has scope over a conjoined (core) NP.
    When a conjoined NP functions as head NP in a relative, however, there is
a potential conflict between the curvacious dying-quail intonation contour, and
the tone-dropped flat pitch required by the larger morphosyntax. The issue is
often avoided by using parallel relative clauses: ‘the man who was here, and the
woman who was here’ (instead of ‘the man and the woman who were here’). As
a result, I have no clear textual examples with conjoined NPs as relative-clause
heads. However, I was able to elicit such examples.
272     Coordination
     In these elicited data, the left conjunct consistently kept its dying-quail
contour. The treatment of the right conjunct was variable. Occasionally, it
appeared with full dying-quail intonation. Much more often, the right conjunct
underwent tone-dropping. When tone-dropping applied, usually there was no
intonational prolongation (i.e., there was no trace of dying-quail). However,
some mixed pronunciations were also observed, with intonational prolongation
of a tone-dropped form. With a noun like n)E-& n ‘woman’, the three outputs for
the right conjunct would be n)E&-n (full dying-quail form), n)E$-n (tone-
dropped but with prolongation), and n)E$-n (tone-dropped with no prolongation).
     The main clause in (417.a) appears in relative-clause form in (417.b), with
three variant forms of the right conjunct. The most common pattern in my
elicited data is the one with n)E-$ n. Two further examples of the construction are
given in (417.c-d).(417)    a. [a&-n       n)E&-n]     ye&y-ya$-ba$

verb). There is otherwise no affix or other segmental change. The noun denotes
an entity that results from the action. See also the cognate nominals of tri-
syllabic stems described in §11.1.6.1, though most of the nominals in question
are not all-H-toned.
       In (189.b), the noun is again all-H-toned, but is segmentally consistent with
a VblN. The actual VblN of trisyllabic verbs has LLH tone (da$nu$N-u@
‘preparing’, i $ji $-r-u@ ‘act of causing to stand’). The nominals da@nu@N-u@ and
i@ji@-r-u@ are therefore the result of overlaying the H-tone contour onto the VblN.
Note that the medial syllable in both the VblN and the H-toned nominal has a
high vowel; cf. VblN V2-Lenition (65).
       In (189.c), bisyllabic CvCv- stems have trisyllabic H-toned nominals
ending in a suffix -gu@. If the stem-final syllable begins with a nasal, the suffix
appears as -Nu@, reflecting Nasalization-Spreading (48); compare the alternation
of Causative allomorphs -gv@- and -Nv@- in (528).
       (189.d) has an apparent suffix -rv@.
       (189.e) is an H-toned bisyllabic, but trimoraic nominal. It is the antonym of
do@gu@-gu@ in (189.c).","[175, 176]"

11.1.5 Fixed subject-verb combinationsA number of expressions relating to time of day, seasons of the year, or weather

             da$˘ƒa@    dE@˘-         ‘night fall’ (da$˘ƒa@ ‘night’)     Elsewhere, ba$r<a@- is a verb meaning ‘beat (e.g. tomtoms)’. It is also in the
phrase cE@nE$ ba$r<a@- ‘be angry’ (cE@nE$ ‘heart’ as seat of emotions). The sense
‘beat’ is felt by informants to be unrelated to ni&˘ ba$r<a@- ‘be summer’ (cf. ‘sun
beat down’), but they do recognize a connection between the latter and ‘be
angry’, and between both of these and ba@n ‘red’ (cf. inchoative ba$na$-r<a@-
‘become red’). There is a related noun ni $-ba@r<a@ ‘summer, hot season’ (with
short-voweled initial morpheme). In ni&˘ si@˘<- ‘day break’, the verb is not
attested except in this combination.
392     VP and predicate structure
     The two stems in pa$ra@ sE@˘<- occur only with each other. There is a related
noun pa$ra$-sE@˘< denoting the post-harvest season in question. a$r<a@ ‘rain [noun]’
and da$˘ƒa@ ‘night’, seen in (625.b), are also common elsewhere. The verb dE@˘- in
da$˘ƒa@ dE@˘- ‘night fall’ has no obvious semantic connection to dE@˘- ‘burn’ or ‘be
burned’. The verb mi $r<e@- in a$r<a@ mi $r<e@- ‘rain fall’ is likewise not close
semantically to homonyms meaning ‘spin (cotton)’ and ‘swallow (food, drink)’.","[413, 414]"

19.5.2 Clause-final ko$yThis particle is added to the end of a sentence as a mild emphatic. Similar forms
occur in Fulfulde and some Songhay languages.(1174) a. n)E&-m      yE@       de@˘-ra$-ba$          ko$y

             2004.3.8    When an original utterance ending in Emphatic ko$y is quoted, Quotative
particle wa precedes ko$y. The result is therefore [S1 wa ko$y], where S1 is the
basic proposition in the original utterance. An example is (1003).

it may be a fairly recent borrowing.
    In (1175.a), the speaker responds with a trace of irritation to a vague
question about what kinds of song-and-dance festivities there are. In (1175.b),
the negation is emphatic.(1175) a. dç$ƒç$-cE$r<E$w<E@   ma$ si^˘      ji -$ jo^˘                de@

19.5.4 Clause-final ‘(not) at all!’ particles (pE@y, so@y, fE@s)Various clause-final emphatic particles, pronounced as interjections, occur in

       ‘They (=Algerians) [topic], if you-Sg are a black-skinned person (=an
       African), your situation (=behavior) is not at all important to them.’
       (gu$ju@-jE^m [bahuvrihi], be$-ru@) 2004.5.4     This is the only occurrence of pE@y in my recorded texts, though I have
heard it in conversation. Elicitation brought out two other particles with similar
’(not) at all’ uses, fE@s and so@y. For so@y, whose more general sense is ‘all,
entirely’, see cf. §8.5.8.7.
     fE@s is unusual in ending in a sibilant, a possibility restricted to interjections
(and poorly integrated borrowings). fE@s itself resembles ‘(not) at all’ particles in
some other languages of the region (e.g. Humburi Senni).

19.5.4.1 Emphatic construction with verb plus topicalized related nominalThis construction has truth-value emphatic function, as when an assertion is
reaffirmed to a skeptical audience, or when someone lays down the law to a
child or other subordinate about what will or will not happen. The discourse
flavor can be approximated by adding ‘sure as hell’ or the like to the free
translation.
    A nominal related to the verb (perhaps a Verbal Noun) is followed by
Topicalizing particle kE@ (§19.1.1), then the inflected verb form (1177.a-b).
There is no prosodic break between the “topical” phrase and the verb,
suggesting that the topical constituent is clause-internal. Where both a Verbal
Noun and another cognate nominal are available, either may be used (1177.c-d).
For verbs like ‘fight’ that are regularly accompanied by a cognate nominal, my
assistant did not accept a proposed version where the cognate nominal and the

uptake checks, where the speaker tests whether the listener is paying attention,
or whether uptake of a difficult passage has occurred.
    As in all local languages, expressions of the general type ‘did you (not)
understand?’ are frequently used by some speakers. The listener is expected to
respond in some way, at least by gesture or grunt. In texts from an older man,
such forms as (1179) were common.(1179) pa@˘mE@-r<a$-w<                 la$˘
       understand-Habit-2SgS           Neg
       ‘Is it not (the case) that you-Sg understand?’     In this pronunciation, pa@˘mE@-r<a$-w< is a slightly irregular variant of
pa@˘m-a@˘r<a$-w<.
     Another backchannel checking phrase, used by a different speaker
occasionally in a long recording, was (1180).(1180) ga$˘-lu@-m
       say-PerfNeg-1SgS
       ‘I did not say …’ (= ‘Did I not say …?’)    In (1180), the preceding discourse is taken retrospectively as a quotative
complement. Though there is no overt marker of interrogative status, (1180) is
evidently interrogative in function: ‘did I not say (…)?’
19.7 GreetingsA greeting sequence begins with an expression relevant to a given time of day
(good morning, good evening, etc.), or to an activity that the initial addressee is
engaged in or returning from (in a field, at a well, at work, arriving at a house,
etc.). The ABAB… sequence is initially asymmetrical (with “adjacency pairs”
consisting of a greeting and a well-defined response) but then may blur into a
symmetrical interaction where essentially the same highly general greetings are
exchanged. ta$˘re@ is used to bring a sequence (or sub-sequence) to an end, but
this may lead to a relaunch of the greeting cycle.
     (1181-2) are examples of morning greeting sequences.","[700, 701, 702, 703]"

20.3 Comparative Jamsay-Gourou phonologyOne striking feature of Gourou is the virtually complete absence of
palatoalveolar {jj c}. In basic (i.e. non-flora-fauna) vocabulary, I recorded
su@ju@rç@ ‘wipe’ (the j here is reduced from *nj, see below), and that was it for
palatoalveolars. In Jamsay, there is some reason to think that a process of
palatalization of velars {g k} before front vowels {i e E} may have been going
on, since e.g. ji is much more common than gi, ce is more common than ke,
and so forth. However, this palatalization is not rigorous in Jamsay, and there is
still a clear phonemic difference between g and j, and between k and c.
      As a result, the Jamsay/Gourou correspondences are g/g or j/g , and k/k or
c/k. Jamsay is more likely to preserve the original distinctions in these cases,
though some recent palatalization may have taken place in Jamsay. Some
examples (among many) are given in (1188). ƒ is essentially an allophone of g
between low back vowels (a_a, ç_ç, ç_a).

pondences. The known cases of the j /z correspondence are in (1189); note that
the consonants in question may be stem-initial or medial (intervocalic).
Where cognates in other northern Dogon languages are known to me, the
consonant (or cluster) corresponding to Jamsay j and Gourou z is given in the
final column: the language (and locality) abbreviations are Nn = Nanga, Be =
Beni, Wa = Walo, Ta = Tabi, Nj = Najamba. The predominant comparative
pattern, seen in (1189.a), is Nn=Be=Nj j (matching Jamsay) but Wa=Ta z

(matching Gourou). Using Beni (for which the current data are fairly complete)
as diagnostic, a smaller number of cases involve Beni s (1189.b), z (1189.c), or
other (1189.d), and there are several sets where no cognates outside of Jamsay
and Gourou have so far been recorded (1189.f). The comparative situation is
complicated by loanwords from Fulfulde (often of Arabic origin) which are set
apart in (1189.g).(1189)    gloss               Jamsay      Gourou         comparative      a. Jamsay/Nanga/Beni/Najamba j = Gourou/Walo/Tabi z

Jamsay j matches Gourou s . In all examples known to me, the consonant in
question is noninitial, and in Jamsay and Gourou always intervocalic. The
usual comparative pattern is that Nanga, Beni, Walo, and Tabi have s (like
Gourou) while Najamba has j (like Jamsay) (1190.a). This suggests that Jamsay
and Najamba have merged two originally distinct consonantal phonemes into j,
while the other languages preserve the distinction (Gourou/Walo/Tabi z versus
s, Nanga/Beni j versus s). In a few cases, the comparative data suggest an
original nasal-initial cluster (1190.b). No comparative data are yet available for

after an initial reduplicative syllable (1192.b). The forms for ‘sneeze’ (1192.c)

comparative evidence points to original clusters of a nasal plus a sibilant or *j

contracted an original bisyllabic *Cuwo to Co˘ (1197.a) and *Ciye to Ce˘
(1197.b). That the Gourou bisyllable is original, at least in the *Cuwo cases, is
showed by wider comparative data not given here. There are several other stems
with w in a similar environment that have not contracted (1197.c).(1197)    gloss               Jamsay                   Gourou      a. *w lost in Jamsay

uncompounded trisyllabic stems. Jamsay likes to harmonize this vowel with one
or both flanking vowels, except for requiring a high vowel in verbal nouns
(suffix -u@). Gourou more systematically favors a high vowel in the middle

Jamsay su@nu@-No@ versus Gourou su@nu@-go@ ‘take down’, causative of ‘go down’
(Jamsay su@go@, Gourou si@ge@). Both causative variants show nasalization of the
consonants, but only one consonant is affected in Gourou. Likewise in the
inchoative adjectival verb ‘go far away’ (Jamsay wa$na$-Na@, Gourou wa$n-ga@),
cf. adjective wa$ƒa@ ‘distant’ (both dialects). A similar correspondence is seen in
the noun ‘trap’: Jamsay jE@nE@NE@, Gourou gE@NgE@.

The following is a relatively comprehensive linguistic bibliography along with a select
bibliography (and filmography) of Dogon ethnography.","[708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720, 721, 722, 723, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, 729, 730, 731, 732, 733, 734, 735, 736, 737, 738, 739, 740, 741, 742, 743]"
"Given the Constraint Against All-L-Toned Stems (99), one could consider the
possibility that one or another of the attested lexical tone patterns is a default,
applied to underlying L-toned stems in order to satisfy the constraint. I do not
favor this (pure) constraint-satisfaction model, but if I did I would suggest final-
mora H-tone as the default. In this view, which I will call the default-final-
mora-H analysis, verbs with (monosyllabic) R, bisyllabic LH, trisyllabic LLH,
and so forth, are reinterpreted as having no lexical H-tone, with the final mora
secondarily acquiring H-tone to satisfy the constraint. The same would apply to
nouns, adjectives, and numerals that have L-tone up to a final H-toned mora.
    Possible evidence for this applicability of the default-final-mora-H
approach to nouns is provided by a small numer of human nouns that normally
(and in some cases exclusively) occur with Sg -n or Pl -m. The stems in
question have a final R-tone in these suffixed forms, and the suffixal nasal is
required to permit expression of the H-tone component of R (i.e., <LH>). The
four known examples are ç$ƒç&-n ‘chief, Hogon’, sa$ƒa&-n ‘chief’s subordinate’,
dç$ƒç&-n ‘Dogon (person)’, and su$rgç&-n ‘weaver’ (plurals ç$ƒç&-m, sa$ƒa&-m,
dç$ƒç&-m, su$rgç&-m). ‘Chief’ has an unsuffixed form ç$ƒç@ ‘leader (e.g. of animal
pack)’, with final H-tone replacing R-tone, and ‘Dogon’ has an unsuffixed form
dç$ƒç@ meaning ‘Dogon language’, while ‘chief’s subordinate’ and ‘weaver’ do
not occur without suffixes. In the default-final-mora-H analysis, these stems are
underlying all-L /ç$ƒç$/, /sa$ƒa$/ , /dç$ƒç$/, and /su$rgç$/, and the final mora secon-
darily acquires H-tone, for example in unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ and in suffixed ç$ƒç&-n.
    A theoretical objection to this argument is that e.g. unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ ‘leader’
can also be derived from /ç$ƒç&/ by a simple tone rule converting R to H tone on a
final monomoraic syllable; see Final-Cv R-to-H Reduction (154), §3.7.4.6,
below.
    Additional grist for this debate comes from tonal relationships between
underived and suffixally derived stems; see below, §3.7.3.1.
    In the sections that follow, I will suggest an autosegmental model for
Jamsay tone, while acknowledging the existence of a few counterexamples to
the rules proposed. In its strongest form, an autosegmental model of tone
separates the segmental tier from the tonal tier. Strictly speaking, the seg-
mental tier must itself be organized into syllables, moras, and feet, but since
these are derivable from the segment string I will speak loosely of these as
elements of the segmental tier.
    A stem, or a word, consists of non-null strings of segments and of tone-
components. Curly brackets {…} will be used for strings of H and L com-
ponents at stem or word level. For example, u@ro@ ‘house’ consists of uro at the
segmental level and {H} at the autosegmental level, while its tonal locative u@ro$
                                                                    3.7 Tones   97‘at the house’ has the same segments but a bitonal {HL} tone pattern. Both the
segmental and tonal tiers may be morphemically complex.
     For this model to work perfectly, there must be rigorous association
processes that connect the tone components H and L to the correct syllables
and/or moras. These processes are easy to formulate when the tonal tier is
monotonal, i.e. just {H}, since of course in this case the H component will
associate to all syllables (and moras) at the segmental level; i.e., it will spread
throughout the stem or word. The rules are also easy to formulate when the
number of tone components, the number of syllables, and the number of moras
all converge, for example bitonal {LH} for a CvCv stem. Complications arise
with bi- or trimoraic syllables, since now the association rules must decide
whether to associate tone components with syllables or with moras. The
challenges increase to the extent that the number of tone components is mis-
matched with the number of relevant segmental-tier units (syllables or moras).
For Jamsay, no pure autosegmental model will work perfectly for all word-
classes. However, it is possible to develop a model that works well for verbs,
and that helps explain statistically important patterns for nouns.","[118, 119]"

person (understood to be a substitute for 2nd person) cannot serve as antecedent
for a reflexive possessor. Therefore ‘you want your nose’ is expressed as ‘3Sg
want 3Sg’s nose’ with no direct indication of coindexation. The Jamsay for
‘3Sg’s nose’ is [wo@ ci@r<E@]. See line 2 of (1267) for the relevant textual example.

i.e. at one or more removes from the ‘say’ verb. In (1119.a-c), there is a
temporal adverbial clause (in the form of a relative headed by ‘day’). In the first
line of (1119.a), the relevant clause has a singular Logophoric, in subject
function. For other pronominal categories, preverbal subject in relative clauses
is expressed by L-toned pronominals (191), but for the Logophoric pronoun we
get E$nE@ with its regular tones (not #E$nE$). A second Logophoric occurs in
(1119.a) in the subsequent main clause as object of ‘have’.
     In (1119.b-c), Pl Logophoric E$nE@ be@ (with regular tones) occurs in subject
function in the adverbial relative clause; see also (839). In the ensuing main
clause, repetition of the Pl Logophoric is optional (1119.b). This main clause
need not contain a mention of the referent in question (1119.c).

                                     18.2 Logophoric and indexing pronouns     651      I have no good examples from the texts of quotations embedded in other
quotations (stacked quotations). The data in (1121), below, were elicited. They
show that it is possible for a logophoric to be coindexed with either the higher
or lower antecedent. I framed the cues with singular and plural antecedents to
reduce any confusion about indexing in any given example.
      In (1121.a), the ‘he’ in the lowest quoted clause is coindexed with Amadou,
the lower of two possible antecedents; either the regular 3Sg wo@ or Logophoric
E$nE@ may be used. In (1121.b), the logophoric ‘them’ in the lowest quoted clause
is coindexed with the higher antecedent ‘they’. These two examples, taken
together, show that logophorics are possible with antecedents one clause up or
two clauses up. In view of this, one might expect (1121.c) as at least an
alternative to (1121.b), with both ‘they’ and ‘Amadou’ binding logophoric
anaphors in the lowest quoted clause. However, my assistant rejected this
version. When the category of the pronoun coindexed with Amadou is made
explicit (as a clause-initial independent pronoun), my assistant gave it as wo@,
i.e., the regular (non-anaphoric) third singular pronoun (1121.d).
      Overall, the data (which should be used with caution) suggest that a) the
highest antecedent readily binds a logophor regardless of depth of embedding,
b) a mid-level antecedent (not the highest quoted speaker) only optionally binds
a logophor, and c) the option to use a nonanaphoric third person pronominal is
especially favored when we would otherwise get two referentially disjoint
logophors in the same clause.(1121) a. [a@˘ma@du$ [wo@ / E$nE@ yE$rE^˘-Ø        jE$-Ø                     wa$]]

           [= (b)]    The use of a logophoric to replace an original first-person pronoun is part of
a broader shift in pronominal categories in reported speech. An original second
person pronominal is regularly converted into a (non-logophoric) third person
pronominal, unless this original second person corresponds to speaker or
addressee in the current speech event. For the larger picture, see the discussion
of “direct” and “indirect” discourse in §17.1.1.","[671, 672, 673, 674]"

18.2.2 Non-logophoric topic-indexing function (E$nE@, E$nE@ be@)Once a discourse referent is established as a topical NP, a co-indexed Reflexive
pronoun (Sg E$nE@, Pl E$nE@ be@) may occur as subject of a following adverbial
clause or non-subject relative clause, or as possessor of the complement of an
adverbial PP that serves as background for a subsequent main clause. The term
“Reflexive” is not quite right for this indexing function, but for lack of a better
label I will use “Refl” in interlinears.
    The adverbial PP type is illustrated in (1122). Such an adverbial phrase is
semantically equivalent to a background clause (e.g. ‘when it is young’).(1122) n)u$˘-to&y     [[E$nE@ ma$     da@ƒa@]        le$], …
       millet.L-seed [[Refl Poss young.stage] in], …
       ‘a millet seedlingx [topic], in itsx early stage of development, …’
       2004.3.8    The adverbial-clause type is shown in (1123), with Reflexive pronominals
in subject function. (1123.b) also has an a second E$nE@ as Reflexive possessor
function, which is not directly relevant here. Another example is (214.a).(1123) b. ki -$ ka@˘         [wa$ka$ti $ [ko@      bE$rE^˘]  E$nE@

            into a better man.’ 2004.3.15 (E$nE@ be@ emended from E$nE@)      The emendation in (1124.c) is based on the plural participle (suffix -m); the
text is about a class of griots (a caste of bards) rather than about an individual.
The speaker’s slip is easily understood, since the initial i n           $ e$ ‘person’ is
unmarked for number, as often with relative heads. The embedded relative
clause ‘whomever they follow’ is headless; the full form would have another
in
 $ e$ ‘person.L’ as head within the brackets: i $ne$ [i n
                                                        $ e$ E$nE@ be@ …].
      The use of E$nE@ in this indexing function does not apply to non-subject
functions within clauses. For these non-subject functions, E$nE@ may only have
the clause-mate subject, not a preposed topic, as antecedent. Therefore we get
ordinary 3Sg wo@ rather than Reflexive E$nE@ in object function (1125.a) and as

to “slip into” the E$nE@ form in a dative (referring to the generic child that has
been the topic of preceding discourse). The dative here is E&n le$, contracted from
E$nE@ le$. The speaker then interrupts himself, and repeats the phrase with the
regular 3Sg dative form wo$-ru@. The example suggests a latent tendency to
expand the use of E$nE@, but one that is subject to self-censorship.(1126) [wo@      u$          ya$Na^˘-Ø                 jE@      me$y<],

above. However, there is a dialectal variant i n$ e@. It appears that some speakers
use this in the full range of functions for E$nE@ (e.g. reflexive possessor,
logophoric). For one of my Dianwely informants, i $ne@ appeared instead of E$nE@

18.3 Reciprocal18.3.1 Simple reciprocals (tç^˘-n, tç^˘-m)Reciprocal is expressed by the noun tç^˘-n (Singular) or tç^˘-m (Plural). The
Singular form is required when there are just two entities involved. When three
or more are involved, either the Singular or the Plural may be used. To the
extent that the Pl form is used when a minimum of three entities (e.g. speaker
and two other persons) is involved, the choice of grammatical number is based
on the perspective of one of the participants (‘me and the other one’ versus
‘me and the other ones’).
     These Reciprocal pronouns are related to a noun meaning ‘comrade,
colleague’, which has the forms in (1129). Human suffixes occur only in the
presence of an overt possessor, as with some inalienable kin terms (§6.2.2). The
possessed forms may be treated as alienable, e.g. ma@ tç@w<ç@-n ‘my comrade’, or
inalienable, e.g. mi $ tç^˘-n ‘my comrade’ (§6.2.1-2). The F-tone in tç^˘-n is
compatible with the overlaid H(H…)L tone of inalienably possessed kin terms.(1129) unpossessed                   possessed Sg possessed Pl        tç@w<ç@

V2-Raising (59). In (528.b), the medial vowel is idiosyncratically syncopated.
Summing across (528), we have the following C2’s: 3 r, 1 w, 2 w<, 1 y<, 2 g.
     The causatives with suffix -Nv@- (528.d-f) are phonologically difficult, but
all have a nasal in the preceding syllable, whereas there are no stems with a
nasal in this position in causatives with surface -gv@- (528.a-b). This suggests
that Nasalization-Spreading (48) has converted /g/ to N ; see (189.c) for a
similar alternation in an unproductive nominal derivation. In (528.c), sa@y<-Na@-
is semantically as well as morphologically specialized, and it co-exists with a
semantically and morphologically regular causative sa@y<a@-w<a@-. Syncope to
(C)vC- before the derivational suffix connects sa@y<-Na@- (528.c) to the two cases
of Syncope in (528.c), reinforcing the view that -gv@- in (528.a-b) and -Nv@- at
least in (528.c) involve the same underlying suffix allomorph.
     To account for the even less transparent (528.d), consider the possibility of
taking the underlying suffix allomorph to be -nv@- rather than -gv@-. (See below
for more cases of -nv@-.) An underlying /su@gu@-no@-/ (the vocalism is regular), in
this analysis, undergoes metathesis of /g…-n/ to /n…-g/, then Nasalization-
Spreading (48) converts the /g/ to N, producing the observed consonantal
sequence n…-N. For the key step (metathesis), see (52) in §3.5.1.2. The same
phonological pattern is seen in wa$na$-Na@ ‘become/make distant’, inchoative and
factitive of adjective wa$ƒa@ ‘distant’ (§9.6, below). However, this brings to only
three the set of derived verbs with this consonantal alternation, and the
phonological derivation I have suggested cannot be very transparent to native
speakers. A similar analysis with -nv@- might work, though, for (528.e), where
however the final shift would be a kind of fortition from w< to N.
     Another phonologically difficult pattern is seen in (529).(529)   input      gloss              causative           gloss        wa$ja@-    ‘be left over’     wa$ƒa$-ja@-         ‘cause to be left over’     The same consonantal alternation is seen in noun we@je$ ‘craziness’,
denominal verb we$ge$-ja@- ‘become crazy’ or ‘drive (sb) crazy’, see §9.7, below.
If the final -jv@- in these two derivatives is taken to be a surface variant of
allomorph -gv@-, an allomorph seen clearly in e.g. bu$ru$-go@- ‘revive’ (528.a),
above, metathesis can again be posited. Thus underlying /Cv$jv$-gv@-/ becomes
/Cv$gv$-jv@-/. If the vowels are from the set {a ç}, the /g/ becomes ƒ by
g-Spirantization (32). This accounts for wa$ƒa$-ja@- in (529); see (51) in §3.5.1.2
for fuller discussion.
     There are some semantically causative derivatives with a third suffix
allomorph -rv@-, identical in form to the productive Reversive suffix seen above,
though the verbs in question do not have reversive derivatives. All known
330     Verbal derivation
examples are in (530). This -rv@- is cognate to Tommo-So Causative -r-

9 Verbal derivation
Derivation of a verb stem from another verb (or an adjective or noun) is by
addition of a derivational suffix to the input stem. Inflectional suffixes follow
the derivational suffix.
     The suffixal vowel in the reversive, causative, and other derivatives with
-CV- suffixes is an unspecified short vowel. It gets its vowel quality by feature-
spreading from the preceding vowel (i.e. the final vowel of the input stem). This
is true even when the preceding vowel is subsequently itself syncopated or
raised to become a high vowel. For the phonology, see Suffixal Vowel-
Spreading (57) (§3.5.2.1) and Presuffixal V2-Raising (59) (§3.5.2.2).
     The suffixes in question will be represented as -rv@-, -wv@-, -gv@-, -nv@-, etc.,
where “v@” represents the unspecified short vowel. This vowel is always
H-toned, but this is predictable since all verb stems end in a H-toned mora.
     If the input verb is all-H-toned, so is the suffixed derivative. If the input
verb is of the type L(L...)H, with only the final mora high-tones, this pattern is
also extended to the suffixed derivative. For example, a bisyllabic HH input
corresponds to a HH-H derivative, while a LH input has a LL-H (note: not #LH-
H) output. (There are a handful of counterexamples to this nonetheless robust
generalization.)
     This phonological relationship between input and derived verb stems lends
itself to an autosegmental analysis, where input verbs may be {H} or {LH}, and
these lexical contours are independently (i.e. noncyclically) applied to suffixal
derivatives, with the final H in {LH} always associated with the final mora.
     -rv@- and -wv@- appear as -r<v@- and -w<v@-, respectively, when preceded by a
nasalized vowel or by a syllable beginning in a nasal or nasalized consonant, by
regular application of Nasalization-Spreading (48) (§3.5.1.1).","[343, 344, 345, 346]"

3.7.3     Tonal morphophonology3.7.3.1    Autosegmental tone association (verbs)The suffixal derivations (e.g. reversive, causative) involve addition of a final
-Cv@- suffix, adding one monomoraic syllable to the stem (§9.1-4). A handful of
lexical idiosyncracies in tone relationships are observed, but the productive
tonal relationships of input to suffixal derivative are those in (120). The hyphen
in the right-hand column corresponds to the stem-suffix boundary in the
derivative.(120)        input        derivative          a. H            H-H
             HH           HH-H

             LH           LL-H
             LLH          LLL-H    In other words, if the input stem is all-H, so is the derivative. If the input
stem has only a final-mora H, so does the derivative (entailing an apparent
“jump” of this H-tone from the final syllable of the underived stem to the
suffixal syllable). An example of the latter: bu$ro@- ‘be revived’, causative
bu$ru$-go@- ‘resuscitate (someone)’.
                                                                  3.7 Tones    109     This problem can be easily resolved within either the default-final-mora-H
analysis (mentioned but not endorsed in §3.7.1.5, above), or the autosegmental
model that I prefer. In the former, the verbs in (120.b) are underlyingly L-toned.
Both the simple stem and the derivative undergo a late rule creating an H-tone
for the final mora, in order to satisfy the constraint (99) against all-L stems.
     In the autosegmental model, the difference between (120.a) and (120.b) is
that the autosegmental level has (lexically specified) {H} in the first case and
bitonal {LH} in the second. In the latter, it is then necessary to specify that the
H is associated with the final mora of a verb stem, as already stipulated in
(113.c) in §3.7.1.7, above. The interesting point is that this association is post-
derivational; that is, it applies to suffixally derived stems in the same way as to
underived stems. There is no evidence for cyclical application. The derivations
of bu$ro@- ‘be revived’ and its causative are in (121), omitting detail about
vocalism that is not relevant here.(121)        ‘be revived’      ‘resuscitate’          comment          a. buro-, {LH}       buro-, Caus, {LH}      lexical input

3.7.3.2    Phonology of H(H…)L and H(L…)L tone overlaysThere are two {HL} tone overlays: a) the widespread H(H…)L and b) the more
restricted pattern H(L…)L that occurs in the first stem in one type of verb-stem
iteration. The two overlays are audibly distinct only with verbs of three or more
syllables. Take, for example, ga$ma$r<a@- ‘divide, share’. The H(H…)L overlay is
realized as HHL in the unsuffixed Perfective ga@ma@r<a$- in relative clause
participles. In the relevant iteration pattern, H(L…)L appears in the first part of
(and indeed the whole of) ga@ma$r<a$-ga$ma$r<a$.
     The existence of two distinct {HL} overlays is obviously a problem for an
autosegmental approach to Jamsay tones, and perhaps to any other “phono-
logical” approach. However, there is a clear asymmetry. H(H…)L occurs
widely in Jamsay, turning up in multiple grammatical contexts involving all
lexical word classes.
     The H(L…)L pattern occurs in one verb-stem iteration pattern that may
involve up to three L-toned stem iterations following the initial H(L…)L
occurrence (§11.6.3). For example, a trisyllabic verb with two iterations has a
tone pattern HLL-LLL-LLL. The iterations have clearly undergone tone-
dropping, erasing lexical tones, but one can argue that the tone-dropping begins
with the second syllable of the first occurrence, hence H[LL-LLL-LLL]. This,
110     Phonology
plus the initial H-tone (which is not lexical), suffice to characterize the tones of
this iteration construction. This is a unique, global tone pattern overlaid on the
entire sequence of stems, not a stem-specific overlay like that for all of the
H(H…)L overlays. Moreover, this iteration pattern is stylistically marked, being
typical of narrative style, unlike the stylistically neutral constructions that
require H(H…)L overlays.
     Given that H(H…  … )L is clearly the phonologically regular instantiation of
{HL} in tone overlays, the question arises whether the association rules for this
overlay are the same as those for basic stems of autosegmental type {HL} as
described above. The central generalization for tone-component association for
stems, extracted from (113.c) in §3.7.1.7, above, is repeated here as (122).(122)    associate final L (preceded by H) to the final mora     For example, the basic lexical forms of {HL} noun stems with a final bi- or
trimoraic syllable are overwhelmingly …F rather than …L in form. For
example, the (C)vCvC segmental shape has 18 cases of lexically HF-toned
(C)v@Cv^C against zero cases of HL #C)v@Cv$C, see (104) in §3.7.1.3, above. The
asymmetry extends to trisyllabic stems, e.g. of shape (C)vCvCvC, where we get
a total of 8 …F stems including 5 HHF (C)v@Cv@Cv^C against one …L stem,
which happens to be of shape CvCCvCvC (107).
     To see whether the grammatical H(H…)L overlay is consistent with this,
we must review how it applies to mono-, bi-, and trimoraic stems. To do this,
we must piece together an overall picture from facts gleaned from the individual
subtypes.
     For inflected verb stems, the H(H…)L overlay occurs in unsuffixed
Perfective participles (in relative clauses). The input-output relations are
indicated in (123). The overlay is limited to stems, disregarding pronominal-
subject suffixes (which have no intrinsic tones and so will eventually acquire
their surface tone by low-level rules). All inflected verb stems of more than one
syllable end in a Cv@ syllable (not Cv@˘ or Cv@C), so we do not have a full range of
syllabic types. The lexical tones of the inputs are irrelevant to the outputs so
they are not indicated here.

            Cv(C)CvCvCv-                    Cv@(C)Cv@Cv@Cv$-     In the monosyllabic case, no choice of association patterns is available,
since bitonal {HL} must associate its two components to the two available
moras, respectively. In the non-monosyllabic cases, we cannot determine
whether the final L tone-component is associated with the final syllable or with
the final mora, since the two converge in every case (there are no final long
vowels, or final consonants, in nonmonosyllabic verbs). The quadrisyllabic case
shows that the H can extend into the third syllable from the left. Example:
gç$lç$rç$-wç@- ‘cause to snore’, Perfective participle gç@lç@rç@-wç$-, as in do$gu$ro$
gç@lç@rç@ mi@ wo$ gç@lç@rç@-wç$-Ø ‘when he/she made me snore’. Since no known
verb has more than four syllables, it appears that once the L-tone is associated
with the final syllable/mora, the H-tone fills up the remainder without limit.

112     Phonology
    Again, in the monosyllabic case there are no choices to be made; when
possessed, the {HL} tone pattern can only be expressed using both input moras,
so we get an F-toned monosyllable. In the bisyllabic cases, ‘husband’ with its
monomoraic syllables can only come out as HL when possessed. However,
‘(man’s) sister’ does provide some new information: for a CvCv˘ stem, the H
component spreads into the onset of the second syllable, resulting in a HF
pattern (yE@sa^˘). The trisyllabic cases do not extend the H into the third syllable,
even in ‘sister’s child’ and ‘grandchild’ where the Sg -n suffix would make a
HHF tone pattern phonologically possible. However, if the domain of H(H…)L
is the stem, disregarding the suffix, ‘sister’s child’ and ‘grandchild’ are
(C)vCvCv- stems of the same type as ‘(woman’s) brother’, and there is no
reason to expect a final-syllable contour tone in the possessed form.
    Modifying adjectives following comparative ga@˘ra@ ‘more, most’ (§12.1.3)
have H(H…)L contours. Some examples are in (125).(125)        gloss         regular form     as modifier, after ga@˘ra@         a. monosyllabic
             ‘black’     jE@m               jE^m         b. bisyllabic

              ‘smooth’     o$nu$r<u@        o@nu@r<u$     Again, the H(H…)L tone overlay applies to stems, disregarding suffixes.
Thus gu$ru@ ‘long’ has an H(H…)L form gu@ru$, from which (adding Sg -n) we
get human Sg HL-toned gu@ri $-n (not HF-toned #gu@ri^-n).
     Bahuvrihi compounds (§5.2.1) have H(H…)L finals. The tones of these
finals are consistent with what we have seen so far in this section. A useful
datum is that HH-toned numeral ko@ro@y ‘six’ (note the final heavy syllable)
appears as HF -ko@ro^y in e.g. mi@r<e@-ku@ro^y ‘having six voices’. This is parallel
in tonal pattern to possessed HF-toned yE@s a^˘ ‘sister’ mentioned above.
     This leaves nominal compounds whose finals have H(H…)L tones. The
data are consistent with what we have seen in the preceding types. Examples are
in (126).

syllabic, I elicited a term for (nonexistent) ‘bush (=wild) cassava’, with the
productive initial e$ju@- ‘field’ or ‘bush, outback’, which is used in several ‘wild
X’ terms. ‘Cassava’ is ba$na$ku^˘< (Bambara loan). The elicited compound ‘bush
cassava’ came out as e$ju@-ba@na@ku^˘<. There is a possibility that the word for
‘cassava’ is a crypto-compound (ba$na$-ku^˘<), as indeed it is in the Bambara
source, so we must be circumspect about assessing this datum. However, on the
face of it, e$ju@-ba@na@ku^˘< does suggest that the H in the H(H…)L overlay may
spread into the onset of a bimoraic third syllable. If so, this strongly supports the
view that the H(H…)L overlay has the same set of realizations as autosegmental
{HL} in lexical stems as documented above. I conclude that the H(H…            … )L
overlay reduces to autosegmental {HL}.","[130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135]"

4.7.2.2    Other ordinals (suffix -nE@)For numerals above ‘1’, ordinals are expressed by adding a suffix -nE@. The
preceding numeral (including composite numerals like ‘eleven’) drops to L-tone
within a level, but if there is a mix of levels (with elements from two or more of
the sets ‘1-99’, hundreds, thousands, and/or millions), tone-dropping does not
cross the phrasal boundary separating two levels. Thus tone-dropping affects the
simple numerals in (247.a-b,d), and the tripartite but single-level numeral in
(247.c), but it affects only the final part of the complex numeral in (247.e),
where ‘hundred’ retains its normal tone.
    For ta&˘n ‘three’, the ordinal is the slightly irregular ta$y-nE@.(247)         form                           gloss          a. single-digit numeral

4.7.3    Fractions and portionsThere are no terms denoting precise numerical fractions of the type ‘half’,
‘(one) third)’, and the like. The relevant sense is communicated pragmatically
by expressions based on a noun such as go@jo$ ‘part, division’ (of an object) or
ku$ru@ ‘(somebody’s) portion, share’, or the adjective ga$ma@ ‘certain (one(s)s, of
a group), some (of a mass)’ (special human Pl ga$ma$ na@m).(248)    a. [ma&Ngo$lo$ ma$ go@jo$]y$        mi&-n       o$˘-Ø

5 Nominal and adjectival compounds
5.1     Nominal compoundsThe combinations noun plus adjective, and noun plus demonstrative (nu@No$),
require tone-dropping on the noun (§6.1.4). This is suggestive of compounding,
since the initials in some noun-noun compound types also drop their tones. In
this section, I discuss phenomena that are more obviously compounds in nature.
     A number of formulae for tone patterns are distinguished in the sections
below, using “x” for a compound initial of variable word-class, “a” for
adjective, “n” for noun, “v” for verb, and Ppl (as usual) for Participial suffix. A
macron (e.g. in “x#”) means that the constituent in question retains the same
tones that it has in isolation. A grave accent (“x$”) means that all tones in the
relevant constituent are dropped to low. An acute accent (“x@”) means that all
tones are raised to high, and a circumflex (“x^”) denotes an overlaid H(H…    … )L
stem-wide tone pattern.","[211, 212, 213]"

3.2.2     Embryonic metrical structureMany languages have stress or accent systems, which generally have at least a
partially undulating, rhythmical nature (alternating stress rules, clash avoidance,
etc.). Jamsay is a tone language, whose tones are important both lexically and
grammatically. Unlike the case in other (non-Dogon) tone languages of the area,
in Jamsay there is no “tone sandhi” across word boundaries. In native
vocabulary, long words may consist entirely of metrically light, monomoraic Cv
syllables. For these reasons, there is no phonetically obvious metrical structure
of the sort we observe in English.
     However, an embryonic metrical structure is manifested in various
phonological rules, particularly those applying to verb stems and their suffixal
derivatives (including Verbal Nouns). The core sequence involved is a stem-
initial bisyllabic [] foot behaving metrically as a trochee [sw], i.e., with a
metrically strong 1 followed by a weak 2. Squared brackets demarcate
metrical feet. Depending on the phonological process in question, there may be
further stipulations on one or both of these syllables (e.g. as to vowel length), or
a following third syllable may be required. There is no clear evidence for
metrical structure in the third, fourth, and fifth syllables of long, uncompounded
stems or words.
     The phonological processes that are at least arguably sensitive to the initial
[sw] asymmetry are those in (28). For each, I give a brief summary (often
oversimplified) of the content of the process, name the morphological
categories affected, and a schematic representation of the relevant structure
                          3.2 Internal phonological structure of stems and words   27(with the targeted segment underlined). In the schemas,  is used for a syllable
that can be of any shape, i.e. initial (C)v(˘)C and noninitial Cv(˘)C, while more
specific representations like (C)v (optional C plus short vowel) are used when
the process requires.(28)    a. g-Spirantization (§3.3.2)
             process: g becomes ƒ in C2 position between low back vowels

            process: V2 deleted after sonorant, usually {r r<}, before coronal

            relevant structure: [Cv]-[C-u@] or the rare [][CvC-u@]        f. Presuffixal V2-Raising (§3.5.2.2)
             process: mid-height V2 {e E) or (o ç} raised to i or u
             domain: suffixally derived verbs (e.g. causative)
             relevant structure: [Cv]-[Cv-     (28.a) is a consonantal lenition that occurs at the onset of 2 (but not e.g.
3). (28.b-e) are vocalic deletions and other lenitions. (28.b,d) are strictly
limited to 2, (28.c) is very strongly associated with 2 though it applies rarely
(in elicitation only) to later syllables; and (28.e) can apply equally to 2 or a
later syllable but there are very few opportunities for it to apply to a later
syllable. (28.f) is not obviously a lenition process, but since raising is associated
28      Phonology
with lenition in (28.e) one could make a case that (28.f) too is a lenition of sorts;
it applies only to 2.
     The relevant structures in (28.a-f) are sufficiently divergent to show that no
fixed “underlying” metrical structure can account for all the data. 2 is always
centrally involved, but the lenitions are in some cases extended to immediately
following syllables. Only (28.a,d) affect stems of all word classes, while
(28.b-c, e-f) apply only to verb stems (including Verbal Nouns derived from
them).
     If the metrical structure were better developed, one would expect some kind
of undulating stress, so that e.g. a five-syllable word would have an audible
organization into metrical feet, e.g. [sw][sw] (with extra-metrical final
syllable). This is not the case.
     A probably related tone-lowering occurs in the second verb stem in certain
types of chains, including iterations (repetitions) of the same stem. This tone-
lowering applies at the level of words (or stems), not syllables. See §15.1.1 and
§16.6.2.","[48, 49, 50]"
"
6.2.2     Inalienable possessionA small number of nouns that I call inalienable have the properties in (334).
The combination of inalienable noun with a nonpronominal possessor NP
behaves like one type of nominal compound (see below).
                                                            6.2 Possessives   237(334)   a. possessed noun has H(H…)L tonal overlay replacing lexical tones
        b. possessor expressed by:
                 L-toned pronominal possessor
             or: noun-headed possessor NP (without Possessive ma$)     The L-toned possessor pronominals are identical in form to the L-toned
preverbal subject pronominals (used in non-subject relative clauses): 1Sg mi $,
2Sg u$, 1Pl E$mE$, etc. (§4.3.1). These contrast with the H-toned possessor
pronominals used with alienable nouns (1Sg ma@, 2Sg a@, 1Pl E@mE@, etc.). A noun-
headed (nonpronominal) NP as inalienable possessor has its regular form
including tones, and the Possessive morpheme ma$ is absent.
     When preceded by a possessor NP or pronoun, the inalienable nouns
themselves take a stem-wide H(H…    … )L tone overlay, realized as HHL on
trisyllables, as HF on bisyllables with bimoraic final syllable, as HL on
bisyllables with monomoraic final syllable, and as F on (bimoraic)
monosyllables. This falling tone contour contrasts with the tone contour for the
same nouns in absolute (unpossessed) position, which is usually a rising
L(L…)H contour, as in ‘I have no …’. I take the absolute form to be lexically
basic. The contrast between absolute and possessed forms is exemplified by
‘father’ in (335). Two possessed examples are given, with pronominal (335.b)
and nominal (335.c) possessors. Note the absence of Possessive ma$ in (335.c).(335)   a. de&˘        sa$˘-ra@-m
           father      have-Neg-1SgS
           ‘I do not have a father.’        b. mi $        de^˘
           1SgP.L      father.HL
           ‘my father’        c. se@ydu$    de^˘
           S          father.HL
           ‘Seydou’s father’    The H(H…L) tone pattern is also found in the final element in nominal
compounds of the type [x# n^] (§5.1.5). In both, the leftmost constituent
(possessor, compound initial) has its regular tones (except for the special series
of pronominal possessors with inalienables), while the rightmost constituent has
the overlaid H(H…L) tone contour. This provides tangible morphophonological
evidence for an abstract grouping of the two constructions. However, the
H(H…L) contour also occurs with Perfective verbs in relative clauses, where
238     Noun phrase structure
both the head noun and any preverbal subject pronominal drop to L-tone. A
grand synthesis of all of these H(H…L) constructions would be audacious.
     The kin terms with inalienable morphosyntax are given in (336), below.
Those not shown with Sg suffix -n do not allow -n (or Pl -m), with the
consequence that they can only be pluralized by adding postnominal Pl particle
be@, as in E$nE@ be@ na^˘ be@ ‘their (Logophoric or Reflexive) mothers’.
     The stems in (336.a) show tonal but no segmental changes. They are
ordered by increasing syllable and mora count. Those in (336.b) involve a
change of final vowel in addition to the tonal change. Those in (336.c) require a
human suffix (Sg -n, Pl -m) when possessed, except that ‘friend’ has Sg tE^n
(apparently with frozen *-n now part of the stem) and Pl tE@n-u$m. ‘Grandchild’
and ‘master’ (336.d) are already H(H…)L, and ‘grandchild’ already has a
human suffix, so there is no audible change in the possessed forms. (336.e)
illustrates how the compound finals a&-n ‘man’ and n)E&-n ‘woman’ are outside of
the scope of the overlaid H(H…)L tone contour, which is realized on the
compound initial ti $rE$-.(336)         gloss                     absolute      H(H…)L possessed form          a. tonal change only

one (‘comrade’) has H-tone, and the others (n=13) have a rising tone contour
with L-tone followed by a single H-tone component on the final mora. This
latter tone pattern is well-designed to maximize the distinctiveness of the
H(H…)L tone overlay in the possessed form. yE$sa&˘ ‘(man’s) sister’ is unique for
a CvCv˘ noun stem in having a LR tone pattern; see (110.a) and cf. §3.7.4.6.
The exceptional noun tç@w<ç@ ‘comrade’ is also unusual in that it has both
alienable and inalienable possessed forms, e.g. mi $ tç^˘-n alongside ma@ tç@w<ç@-n
‘my comrade’.
      Kin and similar relational terms that are treated as alienable include ju@˘ro$
‘twin sibling’, i^-n ‘child’ when used in the kinship sense ‘son or daughter’ (it
also has non-kinship uses), n)E&-n ‘woman’ in the possessed sense ‘wife’, and
tç@ƒç@rç$ ‘namesake’ (<Fulfulde). By definition, these nouns show no tone change
after possessors, and take the regular H-toned pronominal possessors, including
1Sg ma@ and 2Sg a@.
      ba@Na$ ‘owner’ is usually a compound final, but it may also be used with
inalienable possessor; see (283) and discussion there.
      The other noun taking inalienable possessors is ce@ ‘possession’. This is a
grammatically specialized noun, probably related to the regular noun ci g    $ E@ or
cE&˘ ‘thing’, used in ‘whose (is it)?’ interrogatives and as a dummy NP-head with
a possessor when no lexical noun is present. The latter construction is the one
that is relevant here (337). ce@ differs from other inalienable nouns in two
respects: a) it does not occur without a possessor, and b) it does not adopt
{HL} tone contour.(337)       form          gloss            mi $ ce@      ‘mine’ (= ‘my possession’)

          2004.3.24    Recursion is of course possible with inalienable (as with alienable)
possession. In recursive inalienable possession, both kin terms appear with the
H(H…)L tone overlay (339).(339)     [mi $        de^˘]        nE@r<E$
          [1SgP.L      father.HL]   aunt.HL
          ‘my father’s aunt’     In the combination of a nonpronominal NP possessor and a following
inalienable noun, both the possessed noun and the final word of the possessor
NP have at least one H-tone. When the larger syntactic context requires tone-
dropping, both drop their tones simultaneously to all-L, as explained above.
This is a general rule that also applies to compounds with H-tones in both initial
and final. For example, inalienably possessed sa@ydu$ tE^n ‘Seydou’s friend’
drops its tones in (340.a), since it is followed by NP-internal modifiers.
Likewise, when recursive inalienable possession is present, both possessed NPs
drop their already overlaid H(H…)L tones. This is seen in (340.b), where the
NP in question drops its tones as head of a relative.(340)     a. sa$ydu$  tE$n          i $ne$   ga&-n

rather than inalienable in Jamsay: ma@ nu$mo@ ‘my hand’, ma@ bo@n ‘my name’.
                                                              6.2 Possessives   2416.2.3   Independent pronoun plus ma$ in subordinated clauseIn certain complex morphosyntactic constructions, instead of the usual simple
pronominal possessor (with alienable or inalienable noun), we get an
independent pronoun followed by Possessive ma$. We can tell that it is an
independent pronoun (H-toned), rather than an alienable possessor pronominal
(also H-toned), because the 1Sg form is mi@ ma$ (not ma@ ma$) and the 2Sg form
is u@ ma$ (not a@ ma$), these being the two pronominal categories that have distinct
forms as independent pronoun and as alienable possessor.
      This pattern is observable in ‘before …’ clauses. There is a (pseudo-
causative) “verb” form with suffix -wv$, but this word is treated syntactically as
a noun. If just a subject, or just an object, is expressed, the relevant NP takes
(alienable) possessor form. When both a pronominal subject and any object
(pronominal or not) are expressed overtly, the result is normally of type (341),
with m a$ even after a pronominal subject, which takes independent-
pronoun form). (The form of the object NP or pronoun is not at issue in the
current section.) See (941-2) and discussion in §15.2.4.2.(341)   independent.pronoun(subject) ma$ Object verb-wv$ …","[258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263]"

combinable with a manner adverbial clause headed by the L-toned version of

to determine in this case whether the missing head noun is ‘manner/way
(that …)’ or ‘time (when …)’. Perhaps a locative sense ‘place (where …)’ is
also possible, though I can cite no compelling textual examples. Contextual
information and any available native wit must be used in translating such
headless adverbial relatives.
     In (954), because of the immediately following ‘how?’ question, I opt for
‘the way …’ in the free translation, though a temporal reading is also possible.(954)   [i@ne@-m      be$          a^˘-Ø                    ku$<],

15.2.8 ‘From X, until (or: all the way to) Y’The verb ya$Na@ ‘take, pick up’ is widely used to initiate (and continue) a series,
especially in the combination ya$Na@ me$y<. It can take an NP or a clause as
complement. The series is normally concluded with a phrase containing some
combination of ha^l ‘until’, ya&˘- ‘go’, and/or dç@˘- ‘arrive, reach’. The trope is
therefore of the speaker ‘picking up’ one or more objects and going (with it) to
a destination.

15.3 Constructions with superfluous m a$15.3.1 Narrative-climax construction with ma$ plus H(H…)L PerfectiveIn narrative climaxes, it is possible to shift to a highly marked construction
ending in an unsuffixed perfective verb in H(H…)L tone (as in relatives). We
also find Possessive ma$ connecting various preceding constituents in a
somewhat profligate fashion. A pronominal subject is expressed by an
independent pronoun preceding ma$. A chained verb preceding the H(H…)L
verb has its tones dropped to all-L, in the fashion of a compound initial.
Frequently two such clauses are paired, the first of which undergoes intona-
tional prolongation ().
                                     15.3 Constructions with superfluous ma$   573    Some of these features suggest affinities with Verbal Noun complements
(§17.4.1) and ‘before …’ clauses (§15.2.4.2).
    A free translation with ‘suddenly’ or the like captures the narrative flavor.
When two such clauses are paired, a rapid-fire chronological sequence is
suggested, as in line 4 of (963). The contextual translation is ‘no sooner did …
than …’.(963)   ya$Na@       be$        ka^n en France ya&˘        me$y<

specifically as an independent pronoun (here 2Sg u@) plus Possessive ma$.

After a second clause (‘was holding’) whose form is not relevant here, the
passage concludes with a long third clause of the same type as the first
(‘brought down’). What is interesting about this third clause is that each
constituent is linked to the following by Possessive ma$. Excluding one case
where ma$ occurs in its normal function within a possessed NP, the third clause
may be schematically modeled as [he ma$ top ma$ stick ma$ brought down], i.e.
‘he (suddenly) brought down the stick on the top’. When one does include the

preceding object NP (‘a place to put them’) is long and cumbersome is a factor
in favor of inserting ma$ before the verb here.(967)   [i n

        2004.3.9     In (968), what appears to be a chained VP ending in ya&˘ ‘go’ is followed,
after an intonation break, by ma$ plus noun. Perhaps ma$ here is an improvised
connective, as the structure of the sentence is adjusted in mid-stream.(968)   … ga@˘ra@         a&-n       ta@na@-Na@-m$,

16 Conditional constructions
16.1 Simple conditional with d ey (de$ y , de@ y , de @ ) ‘if’The unmarked simple conditional clause is of the form [S1 dey, S2]. In this
construction, S1 denotes an eventuality that has occurred, does occur, or may
occur. The pitch of dey is variable. When clause-final, it behaves as an atonal
morpheme, which then copies the final tone of the preceding word, see Atonal-
Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137). Because of the way H- and L-tones pattern
with AN suffixes, in practice we get de@y after negative verbs (if not
defocalized) and after lexical-stem pseudo-participles, but de$y in the more
common combination with a preceding positive verb.
     When non-clause-final (i.e. when followed by another particle), the basic
form is H-toned de@y. In some high-frequency combinations this simplifies to de@
(§16.1.3).
     Both antecedent and consequent clauses have main-clause form in the
great majority of cases, so their verbs have pronominal suffixes as appropriate.
dey occurs at the end of the antecedent clause, which normally precedes the
consequent, though occasional textual examples of postposed antecedent
clauses (probably afterthoughts) have turned up. The construction is very
common, and one can often translate dey as ‘when …’ instead of as ‘if’. In
other words, [S1 dey, S2] may simply indicate chronological ordering, as in the
description of a complex activity involving multiple sequential actions, so long
as there is some connection between these actions (a necessary sequencing, for
example). The [S1 dey, S2] construction therefore competes with the explicitly
temporal [[S1 (ga@˘) ka^n], S2] construction (§15.2.2.1).","[588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598]"
"
3.7.3.3    Phonology of Tone-GraftingThere are two grammatical contexts calling for Tone-Grafting. These are the
tonal locative of nouns, and the unsuffixed Imperfective of verbs (§10.1.2.8). In
both cases, an L-tone is grafted onto the end of the stem. However, the
phonology differs subtly in the two cases.
    Tonal locatives can be formed from a limited number of noun stems
(§8.1.1). A few noun-like spatial postpositions are also tonal locatives in form.
A tonal locative cannot be followed by a suffix, so there is no further phonology
to worry about beyond the formation of the tonal locative itself.
    As it happens, there are no stems with lexical …HL or …F tone that have
tonal locatives. If they did, the tonal locative would be homophonous with the
simple stem. In addition, no uncompounded noun stem of two or more syllables
ending in a heavy (bi- or trimoraic) syllable has a tonal locative. As a result, the
phonological range of inputs is rather limited: H- and R-toned Cv˘ (127.a-b),
R-toned Cv&n (127.c), and longer stems ending in H-toned …Cv@ (127.d-e).

and gç&˘ $ ‘in the granary’, gu&n ‘back (body)’ and postposition gu&nn$ ‘behind’,
u@ro@ ‘house’ and u@ro$$ ‘in the house, at home’, bç$rç@ ‘bottom’ and bç$rç^˘ ‘at the
bottom’.
      In (127.a) and (127.d), there is no increase in moras. (127.a) goes from long
H-toned vowel to long F-toned vowel. (127.d) goes from …HH (last two
syllables are H-toned) to …HL. However, in the other three cases the final
syllable grows an extra mora. In (127.b), tonal locative Cv&˘ $ is, properly
speaking, Cv$v@v$ with a bell-shaped tone requiring three moras (the extra
duration is audible). (127.e) likewise goes from final monomoraic Cv@ to final
bimoraic Cv^˘. In (127.c), the final n is noticeably lengthened.
      These additional moras are needed to give audible expression to the central
feature of tonal locatives, namely an extra L-tone grafted onto the end of the
noun. To understand the phonology, it is necessary to recognize that the input
Cv@˘ in (127.a) has a single H autosegment spread over both moras of the long
vowel, and that the input in (127.d) has a single H autosegment spread over (at
least) the last two syllables. In these cases, the grafted L occupies the final
mora, without completely erasing the existing lexical H. In (127.b-c,e), if the
grafted L simply occupied the final mora, the existing lexical H would be
completely erased. This is not allowed, so the only solution is to extend the final
segment, creating an additional mora to accomodate the grafted L. This is taken
care of by a low-level rule, Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141), see §3.7.4.1,
below.
      For the unsuffixed Imperfective, things are subtly different. The phono-
logically relevant typology of inputs is this: H- and R-toned Cv˘-, and longer
stems ending in H-toned short vowel (…Cv@-). (The single consonant-final
quasi-verb, ku$n- ‘be in’, has no imperfective forms.) The input-output
relationships are as in (128).
                                                                            3.7 Tones      115(128)         verb              unsuffixed Impf         comment         a.   Cv@˘-             Cv^˘-

                                                                                     @ $
         c.   …Cv@Cv@-          …Cv@Cv^-                if -Ø suffix, …Cv@Cv^˘-Ø

ju$gç@- ‘know’ and /ju$gç^-/.
     Unlike the case with tonal locatives, the H-tone component is never
deleted on the final input vowel, even when, as in (128.c), it is part of an
autosegment extending over at least the last two syllables. This is the crucial
phonological difference between the unsuffixed Imperfective and the tonal
locative.
     The unsuffixed Imperfective is followed either by pronominal-subject
suffixes (e.g. 1Sg -m, 3Sg -Ø, 3Pl -ba) or, in relative clauses, by Participial
suffixes (Nonhuman -Ø, Sg -n, Pl -m). These suffixes may have the shape -Ø,
-C (nasal), or -Cv, and all are atonal (they lack intrinsic tones of their own). The
tone patterns of the -Ø and -C cases can be handled by simple, lower-level tone
rules. With -Ø suffix, the final vowel of the unsuffixed Imperfective must be
prolonged by an extra mora where necessary to permit all tone components to
be expressed; this is the case in (128.b-d) but not (128.a); see Contour-Tone
Mora-Addition (141), §3.7.4.1. With -C suffix, the contour tone is realized over
the entire resulting bi- or trimoraic syllable; see Rightward H-Spreading,
§3.7.4.4.
     The atonal -Cv suffix is more interesting phonologically. The two suffixes
in question are 3Pl -ba and 2Pl -be. Consider the data in (129).(129)         gloss     lexical     3Sg Impf           1Sg Impf            3Pl Impf         a. ‘send’      ti@˘-       ti^˘-Ø             ti@˘-m$             ti@˘-ba$         b. ‘go’        ya&˘-       ya&˘ $-Ø           ya&˘-m$             ya&˘-ba$
                                    [= ya$aa@ $-Ø]     [= ya$a@-m$]         c. ‘know’ ju$gç@-          ju$gç^˘-Ø          ju$gç@-m$           ju$gç@-ba$    For all three verbs in (129), the 3Pl unsuffixed Imperfective (rightmost
column) expresses the grafted L exclusively on the 3Pl suffix, so the preceding
syllable is H- or R-toned as per its lexical form. In the cases of (129.b-c), it
would be possible to first graft the L onto the stem-final syllable, allow the L to
spread to the suffixal syllable by Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137), and
116     Phonology
then simplify the stem-final syllable to R in (129.b) and to H in (129.c) on the
grounds that these syllables do not have enough moras to express their
respective contour tones, see Contour-Tone Stretching (143) (§3.7.4.2, below).
     Objection: there is no purely phonological reason why /ti^˘-ba$/ ‘they will
send’ should reduce its stem tone from F to H to produce ti@˘-ba$. We do in fact
get a surface F-tone before 3Pl -ba$ in combination with Perfective suffix
allomorph -a^˘- (§10.1.2.3), as in na@N-a^˘-ba$ ‘they have forgotten’. Since a long
F-toned vowel can be pronounced before a -Cv$ suffix, I reject a derivation of
H-L ti@˘-ba$ via F-L /ti^˘-ba$/ . This suggests that Tone-Grafting onto the stem-final
syllable does not, as such, take place when a nonzero suffix is present; rather,
the floating L initially located between the stem and the suffix attaches itself to
the suffix (i.e. to the right) rather than to the stem (to the left). Thus the
derivation I prefer for ti@˘-ba$ is (130.a), not (130.b). However, a derivation
similar to that in (130.b) does occur when the unsuffixed Imperfective is
followed by the clitic kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’, as in ti@˘kç$ ‘it will send’; cf. (150)
and (569).(130)    a. (preferred derivation)

Perfective Negative suffix -li@- is further evidence that this reduplicated type
belongs to the perfective system. No other verb is attested in this reduplicated
negative form. The usual negative counterpart of the reduplicated Perfective is
the (unreduplicated) Perfective Negative with L-toned stem followed by -li@-.
     With stance verbs, the reduplicated Perfective is used for resultative-stative
sense: i $-i@jE$- ‘be standing (=in standing position)’, di $-da^˘<- ‘be sitting
(=seated)’. Likewise with ‘shut’ and ‘open’, hence pi@ne@- ‘shut’ (transitive),
pi@-pi@ne$- ‘(e.g. door) be shut’.
     In some textual examples the precise aspectual value of the reduplicated
Perfective is difficult to determine. In most cases (perhaps all) there is an
element of duration or iteration. All textual examples (excluding repeats with
the same verbs) are given in (565).

between the reduplicated Perfective and the reduplicated Imperfective, except in
the presence of a syllabic pronominal-subject suffix. This is because the
H(H…)L overlaid tone of the perfective, and the grafted-on final L-tone of the
imperfective, converge phonetically as F-tone on the base stem following the
Ci $- reduplicative segment. In (567), we cannot directly determine whether the
reduplicated Perfective with H(H…)L or the reduplicated Imperfective with
grafted-on final L-tone is at hand.

          ‘Hey, there are lots of kinds of Dogon festivities!’ 2004.3.22     When we add a syllabic suffix (3Pl -ba, 2Pl -be), however, we can
distinguish the reduplicated Perfective from the reduplicated Imperfective even
for (C)v@˘- stems. For the reduplicated Perfective, the H(H…)L tone overlay
applies to the stem only, and is not affected by addition of the suffix, so the
result is e.g. 3Pl C1i $-C1v^˘-ba$ with F-tone on the base. For the reduplicated
Imperfective, the extra L-tone component is expressed on a nonzero
pronominal-subject suffix if there is one, see Tone-Grafting (131). This leaves
the base with its lexical tone, in this case H, so we get e.g. 3Pl C1i $-C1v@˘-ba$.
Applying this test to ji -$ jo^˘-Ø shows that it is a reduplicated Perfective, as
shown by the F-toned -jo^˘- in (568). This vindicates the perfective labeling in
(567), above. Likewise, wi $-wç^˘-w in (566), above, has a 2Pl counterpart
wi $-wç^˘-be$ ‘you-Pl are’ with F-tone.(568)     ji -$ jo^˘-ba$

          ‘They are numerous.’
10.1.2.8 Unsuffixed Imperfective (positive)The unsuffixed Imperfective is common in positive clauses denoting regularly
occurring events (flanking the present time or a displaced temporal center), non-
adjectival statives such as ‘know’ with present relevance, and future events. It is
glossed as “.Impf” in interlinears, separated from the gloss of the verb by a
period rather than by a hyphen. The category is common in texts describing
routinely recurring event types (e.g. cooking techniques, annual seasonal
patterns). This form gets competition from suffixally marked categories of the
imperfective system, Habitual -a@˘ra$- and (marked) Imperfective -tç@ƒç$-. The
three are, to some extent, interchangeable (the category labeled “Habitual” has
fairly broad imperfective functions).
     The unsuffixed Imperfective is formed by adding a free (i.e. floating)
L-tone to the end of the lexical stem. If there is a nonzero pronominal-subject
or Participial suffix, the L must be realized on the suffixal mora-bearing
segment. In the absence of a suffixal mora, the floating L must be grafted onto
the end of the verb stem (which always ends in an H-tone), resulting in a stem-
final F-tone. If the F-tone at this point is associated with a monomoraic syllable
(i.e. with a short vowel), this vowel is lengthened to two moras to permit
audible expression of the contour tone. If the stem is monosyllabic R-toned
                                      10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs   359Cv&˘-, grafting the floating L produces a <LHL> tone, which forces lengthening
of the bimoraic stem syllable to trimoraic. For the phonology see Tone-Grafting
(131) and Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141).
     In relative clauses, for H-toned monosyllabic stems, i.e. (C)v@˘-, there is
homophony between participles based on the unsuffixed Perfective and those
based on the unsuffixed Imperfective, except for nonhuman subject (on which
see below). Thus a^˘-Ø from a@˘- ‘catch’, with Nonhuman Participial suffix, could
be either the unsuffixed Perfective with H(H…)L tone overlay, realized on a
monosyllable as F-tone, or the unsuffixed Imperfective with final L-tone grafted
on to the lexical tone (in this case, H), again resulting in F-tone. Since the only
Participial suffixes are -Ø (nonhuman), -n (Sg), and -m (Pl), there is no
participle with a syllabic suffix. Therefore, for human (Sg or Pl) subject, the
homophony between Perfective and Imperfective participles of (C)v@˘- is
unrelieved.
     A unique attribute of the unsuffixed Imperfective in both main and relative
clauses is that a nonhuman subject pronominal is expressed by adding
cliticized kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’ after the verb stem. This is a special case of kç$,
a locational-existential ‘be’ quasi-verb (§11.2.2.2). This quasi-verb is not
always cliticized, but cliticized kç$ is also used after predicative adjectives with
nonhuman subject, as in ‘it is (big, red, etc.)’ (§11.4.1). The use of kç$ to
distinguish nonhuman from 3Sg subject is limited to the unsuffixed
Imperfective. For all other AN categories (including all suffixally marked forms
of the imperfective system, and including the Imperfective Negative), verbs
make no distinction between nonhuman and (human) 3Sg subject, which are
jointly expressed by zero suffix on the verb. Compare the (marked) Perfective
and unsuffixed Imperfective of the verb ‘come’ (569).(569)   subject          Perfective       unsuffixed Imperfective        3Sg (human)      ye&y-ya$-Ø       yE$rE^˘-Ø
        Nonh               ""              yE$rE@kç$     This kç$ is morphosyntactically a second verb, albeit cliticized. It is not a
suffix on a par with those for the human pronominal categories. This is shown
by the fact that Participial suffixes are added to kç$- rather than directly to the
Imperfective stem in relative clauses (§14.1.9) and related subordinated clauses.
In addition, kç$ is attested (though rarely) as the final element in a verb-chain
of the type [… VERB me$y<kç$], see (904) in §15.1.14.
     Textual examples of the unsuffixed Imperfective are in (570).

reduplicated Imperfective with final L-tone component grafted on. The two can
be distinguished when a syllabic suffix (3Pl -ba, 2Pl -be) is added. For R-toned
monosyllabic stems, and all nonmonosyllabic stems, no confusion is possible

"(60)      Post-Sonorant Syncope (verbs)          A short vowel is deleted (syncopated) if…

              b) it is preceded by a (coronal) rhotic {r r<}; and
              c) it is followed by a suffix-initial coronal {t d n s l r} or y, or by
                   Linker ti@ (§15.1.16); and
              d) the first syllable of the (C)vCv stem has a short vowel    Condition (60.a) relates to the comments about abstract metrical structure in
§3.2.2, above. Condition (60.d) is less a dynamic process than a constraint on
Post-Sonorant Syncope designed to prevent adverse consequences, since
syncopating the second vowel of (C)v˘Cv would create a superheavy syllable.
The inclusion of suffix-initial y as a conditioning factor for verbs only in (60.c)
                                             3.5 Segmental phonological rules   57is interesting, but also somewhat circular, since the suffix in question (Per-
fective -yE$-/-ya$-) is itself an allomorph that can only be added to a bisyllabic
stem if this is a syncopating rhotic-medial stem (the suffix can also be added to
Cv˘- monosyllabic stems, §10.1.2.3).
        While Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) is almost always implemented in
conversational speech, in formal elicitation I have recorded unsyncopated
variants with suffixes other than Perfective -yE$-/-ya$-.
        Most examples involve AN suffixes. However, the syncope process can
also occur when a verb is followed by Linker ti@ in a verb- or VP-chain
(§15.1.16), as in … ka@n ti@ me$y ‘make … (and …)’ from ka@r<a@- ‘do, make’.
        The process does not apply in nominal compounds: tç$rç$-tu$mo@ ‘mountain
boulder’.
        Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) feeds two other rules that disguise the identity
of an underlying rhotic. Derhoticization (§3.5.5.1) converts r< (which cannot
occur syllable-finally) to n. Rhotic Assimilation (77) (§3.5.5.2) assimilates r
totally to the following coronal consonant, resulting in a geminate, as already
seen in (60), above. Therefore the outputs are nC from underlying /r<vC/, and
geminate C˘ from underlying /rvC/, where C is the coronal. Note that e.g. tt
resulting from Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) can only reflect /rt/, since syncope
does not apply between underlying t’s: ja@tE$ ja@tE@-ti $-Ø ‘he did a calculation’.
        Post-Sonorant Syncope also feeds Rhotic-Cluster Lateralization (79).
        Examples of Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) are ga&y-ya$ ‘pass.Perf’ from stem
ga$ra@- and ye$l-li@- ‘not come.Perf’ from stem yE$rE@- (see next paragraph). There
are many such (C)vC2v- verbs with r or r< as C2, and there are plenty of
coronal-initial AN (aspect-negation) suffixes that can follow them (Perfective
-ti -$ , Resultative -sa$-, Recent Perfect -jE$-, Experiential Perfect -tE@rE$-,
Imperfective -tç@ƒç$-).
        In the case of yE$rE@- ‘come’, Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) is irregularly
accompanied by a change in vowel quality from E to e. Thus unsuffixed

‘he/she will not come’, but suffixed Perfective ye&y-ya$-Ø ‘he/she came’,
ye$l-li@-Ø ‘he/she did not come’, etc. No similar vocalic change occurs with e.g.
bE$rE@- ‘get’.
        The phonological scope of Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) seems to be
expanding, but in a lexicalized way. One expansion is in the direction of
including nasal n along with {r r<} as the preceding consonants that licence
syncope. While most Cvnv- stems do not allow syncope, the important verb
ku@no@- ‘put’ does optionally syncopate before the same coronal-initial suffixes:
ku@no@-ti $- or ku@n-ti -$ ‘put.Perf’. This may have been suggested by the
phonologically (and semantically) similar verb ku@r<o@- ‘put on, wear (garment)’,
which regularly syncopates like other Cvr<v- stems: Perfective ku@n-ti $ ‘wore’.
Because of Derhoticization, the syncopated forms of ku@no@- ‘put’ and of ku@r<o@-
58     Phonology
‘wear’ are homophonous as [ku@n-]. There is no compelling practical need to
distinguish ‘put (object)’ from ‘put on, wear (garment)’, which overlap lexically
in many languages (English put and put on, French mettre).
       Syncopated variants were also occasionally observed with u@no@- ‘put down’
(Perf u@n-ti -$ varying with u@no@-ti $-) and mu$no@- ‘braid’ (Imperfective
mu&n-tç@ƒç$-). Note that ku@no@-, u@no@-, and mu$no@- share a segmental shape
(C)uno- with u in the first syllable. I did not observe syncope with e.g. na$na@-
‘chase away’, pa@na@- ‘butcher’, sa@na@- ‘undo braids’, or pi@ne@- ‘shut (door)’.
       A second extension is in the direction of allowing the first stem syllable to
have a long vowel. There is one Cv˘rv- verb that syncopates, namely jE$˘rE@-
‘bring’. The verb appears in syncopating suffixal environments as /je&r-/, which
invariably undergoes Rhotic Assimilation (77), as in Perfective je&t-ti $- (likewise
je$s-sa$-, je$l-li@-, etc.). The long vowel is shortened and raised from E˘ to e. It
may be that the central irregularity is that jE$˘rE@- is shortened in syncopating
environments; this then undergoes regular Post-Sonorant Syncope (60).
However, there is no shortening of jE$˘rE@- in e.g. Imperfective Negative
jE$˘rE$-go@-, i.e. where the suffix does not begin with a coronal. The lexicalization
of syncopation for jE$˘rE@- ‘bring’ is demonstrated by the failure of the homonym
jE$˘rE@- ‘criticize’ to syncopate: je&t-ti $- ‘bring-Perf’ versus jE$˘rE@-ti -$ ‘criticize-
Perf’. The other case like jE$˘rE@- is the combination of Habitual AN suffix -a@˘ra$-
with following (stative) Negative -la@- (§11.4.3). A form like be@˘-ra$-la@-Ø ‘it
doesn’t happen’ optionally syncopates to be^˘-l-la@-Ø.
       There is one other (optionally) syncopating verb that has both medial n (like
ku@no@- ‘put’) and a long vowel (like jE$˘rE@- ‘bring’), namely mç$˘-nç@- ‘bring
together’ (also ‘gather, assemble’). For example, syncopated Perfective
mç&˘-n-ti -$ varies freely with unsyncopated mç$˘-nç@-ti -$ . Unlike jE$˘rE@-, mç$˘-nç@-
does not shorten its long vowel when it syncopates. mç$˘-nç@- is the causative of
mç$r<ç@- ‘come together’ (50.a), which of course also syncopates.
       Extended exemplification of regular and irregular Post-Sonorant Syncope
(60) with verb-suffix combinations is given in (61), using Perfective allomorphs
-ti -$ or -ya$-. Rhotic Assimilation (77) is also seen in (61.a-b), and Derhoti-

sonorant) other than a rhotic, aside from the few cases of n just mentioned. In
particular, if C2 is l, syncope does not occur: ka@la@-ti -$ ‘park.Perf’, sa@la@-ti $-
‘pray.Perf’. Likewise, if C2 is non-coronal, syncope does not apply before a
cororal C3, hence gç$Nç@-ti -$ ‘spin.Perf’. With the exception of jE$˘rE@- ‘bring’, the
rule does not apply to Cv˘Cv- stems or to trisyllabic stems even if all other
factors are favorable: ga$˘r<a@-ti ‘mix.Perf’, ji $˘rE@-ti -$ ‘mix.Perf’, so@go@ro@-ti $-
‘(unseen object) make a noise.Perf’, ga$ma$r<a@-ti -$ ‘divide.Perf’.
    However, there is a single bisyllabic verb with a medial velar nasal that
undergoes optional syncope when the suffix (or pronominal subject clitic) also
begins with a velar. The verb is ta@Na@- ‘happen’, and the triggering morpheme is
either Imperfective Negative -go@- or (in the unsuffixed Imperfective)
Nonhuman subject pronominal kç$.(62)     a. ta@Na@kç$       = ta@Nkç$        ‘it will happen’
         b. ta$Na$-go@-Ø     = ta$N-go@-Ø      ‘it will not happen’   Since the flanking consonants in ta@Nkç$ and ta$N-go@-Ø constitute
homorganic (velar) nasal-stop pairs, there is a clear similarity between this and
60     Phonology
examples involving coronals in (61), especially ku@n-ti $- in (61.d). Syncope does
not occur when the suffix begins in a non-velar C, such as 3Pl ta@Na@-ba$.
     I have been unable to find examples of Post-Sonorant Syncope (60)
involving labials. The candidates would be verbs like ka@ma@- ‘toss (cowries)’
with 3Pl subject suffix -ba$. However, informants insisted on e.g. imperfective
ka@ma@-ba$ ‘they toss (cowries)’, and I never heard syncopated forms of the type
#ka@m-ba$.
     Another context where Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) occurs is in suffixal
derivation of verbs, when Reversive suffix -rv- is added to a Cvrv- stem (there
is also one example involving a Cvr<v- stem). Here the output of Syncope is
modified by yet another CC-cluster adjustment, this time /rr/ (or /r<r/)
appearing as ll, see Rhotic-Cluster Lateralization (§3.5.5.3, below). In (63.a),
the unsyncopated form of the Reversive is illustrated. In (63.b), we see Post-
Rhotic Symcope and Rhotic-Cluster Lateralization. For more on reversives, see
§9.1.(63)          input     gloss              Reversive     gloss          a. pa@ƒa@-    ‘tie’              pa@ƒa@-ra@-   ‘untie’          b. pi@re@-    ‘get stuck’     pi@l-le-         ‘get unstuck’
             kç@rç@-    ‘hang up, hook’ kç@l-lç@-        ‘unhook’
             ma$r<a@-   ‘be lost’       ma$l-la@-        ‘be recovered    Some apparent cases of syncope can be explained in other ways. For
example, if tE@m-nE@- ‘make (sth) wet’ is interpreted as the causative of tE@mE@-
‘become wet’, syncope must be assumed. However, tE@m-nE@- is more reasonably
explained as a direct verbalization from adjective tE@m ‘wet’.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82]"

8.3.2     Simple and complex PPsA simple PP is of the form [X Postp], where the postposition is added directly to
the complement NP (cf. English in, at). A complex PP is of the form [X ma$
Postp], where Possessive ma$ intervenes. The postpositions used in the complex
type have a (syntactic) possessor as complement (cf. English in front of, ahead
of). Such postpositions probably all originated as nouns in tonal locative form.
The original construction was therefore of the type *[[X’s N]-Loc] (e.g. ‘on X’s
head’), where X was the possessor of the noun N, rather than the (direct)
complement of the locative marker.
     In spite of this historical origin, there remains the question whether
complex PPs in modern Jamsay are still syntactically analysable as [[X’s N]-
Loc] with an embedded possessor, or have been reanalysed so that
[X ma$ Postp] with a purely formal Possessive morpheme now behaves like
simple [X Postp]. It is possible to test this by observing relativization patterns.
When a simple PP is relativized on, both the postposition and the final word of
the complement NP undergo tone-dropping (§14.6.1). When a complex PP of
the type [X ma$ Postp] is relativized on, two patterns are observed: a) both the
postposition and (the last word of) the complement NP are tone-dropped; b)
only (the last word of) the complement NP is tone-dropped (§14.6.2).

8.3.3     ‘in’ (bE@rE$$ and bE$rE^˘)An explicitly locative postposition, specifying that the focal object is enclosed
within the boundaries of the landmark object, takes either of the forms in (450).
Both bE@rE$, which requires a non-pronominal NP complement, and bE$rE^˘, which
can take either a pronoun or an NP as complement, are related to the noun bE$rE@
‘belly’.(450)          after pronoun                      after NP          a. —                                    NP + bE@rE$

alienably possessed noun. Its complement is a possessor in form: noun-headed
NP plus Possessive ma$, or a pronominal possessor. By comparing it to the noun
bE$rE@ ‘belly’, we see that it has an incremental final F-tone (as in tonal
locatives), preserving the lexical L-tone of the first syllable.(451)     a. ko@           bE$rE^˘

             2003.3.1     By contrast, bE@rE$ is used only with noun-headed (i.e. nonpronominal)
complements. With its HL tone, it may be compared to the stem-level H(H…)L
overlay on tonal locatives of nouns, e.g. u@ro$ ‘at the house, (at) home’ (§8.1,
above). However, it is also similar to the compound type [x# n^] (§5.1.5), and to
inalienably possessed nouns (§6.2.2).

fact that only bE$rE^˘ is used with pronouns is an indication that there is little or
no semantic difference.
8.3.4   ‘on; on the head of; about’ (ku^˘<)This postposition is the tonal-locative (HL-tone) form of ku@˘< ‘head’. It may be
used in a fairly literal sense, roughly ‘on the head of’, with human or animate
complement, as in (453). With a noun-headed (nonpronominal) complement,
Possessive ma$ is used.(453)   [e$ju$-nç$w<ç@  te@=>]      [e@    ku^˘<] nu$mo@ ga@˘        ka^n

more general gloss ‘on’ or ‘onto’ is appropriate. An adversarial (or malefactive)
nuance is apparent here, as it is in the following (454).(454)   [a&-n     ma$         ku^˘<]  ya&˘-yE$-ba$  ta@Na$˘  de$y, …

a verb of speech or thought.

rest, on or near the top of the landmark object. Compare the adverbial phrase
ma@na@ le@ ‘on top, up above’ (448.c).
     ma@na$ is added directly to a noun, without possessor marking. However.

locational PP itself does not specify directionality of movement, but is
compatible with directionality expressed by a motion verb (see beginning of this
chapter).

on tree foliage overhead at night. Not understanding this, Hyena had just asked
whether Camel was lying down to sleep all night on the shed.
    ma@na$ can be used with reference to a vertical rather than horizontal
position, e.g. ‘on the wall’, when the context is otherwise suggestive of hori-

connection with a reference time. The complement is again expressed as a

as meaning ‘after our departure’ and the like. As a postposition without le@,

the rough equivalence in English between follow behind and follow after).

1.2   Jamsay languageIn terms of population, Jamsay is the largest of all Dogon languages, with over
30,000 speakers. It is spoken in a vast triangular zone whose apexes are: 1) the
area around Douentza (N 15º 00´ latitude by W 2º 56´ longitude), including
Jamsay-speaking villages Dianwely Kessel, Dianwely Maoudé, Petaka, and
Boumbam; 2) the area around Mondoro (N 14º 00´ by W 1º 58´) near the
Burkina border east of Tabi mountain; and 3) the town of Koro (N 14º 00=4´ by
W 3º 4´)), also near the Burkina border but farther southwest. The Gourou
dialect is spoken in a few villages near Koro, such as Kiri (on the road from
Koro to Burkina). Aside from Gourou, dialectal variation within Jamsay has not
been studied seriously. Initial impressions are that the dialectal variation
excluding Gourou is not great. However, my Douentza-area informants spoke of
distinctive local dialects such as that of Pergué (N 14º 48´ by W 2º 59´), and a
full survey including the Mondoro and Koro areas is desirable. My Jamsay data
are chiefly from Dianwely Kessel, with some complementary lexical data on
Gourou from Kiri.
     The Jamsay recognize that they are newcomers, in comparison to the older
Dogon in the zone, who include not only speakers of the other languages
mentioned above but also some other persons who have now been linguistically
Jamsay-ized while remaining conscious of their status as “owners” of the
country. Prior to the Jamsay migration of perhaps a few hundred years ago,
                                                             1.3 Environment   3Dogon villages were almost entirely confined to the inselbergs (tectonic
mountains, often rising abruptly from the plains in the form of sheer cliffs,
either cone-shaped or extending as ridges). The villages were either on the
shoulders of the cliffs, or on the summits of the inselbergs—locations blessed
by water sources (mountain springs) but also favored by military considerations
(defences against marauding Tuaregs, Fulbe, and slave-traders). These Dogon
would farm some fields in the plains, generally not far from the inselbergs, as
well as some fields on the summits and some vegetable gardening near water
sources. The Jamsay were the first Dogon in the area to build villages in the
unprotected flat plains between the often widely separated inselbergs, and the
first to fully develop fields in the plains. To defend themselves, they developed
a culture of male bravado that is still in evidence today under more benign
external conditions. They do not fit the stereotype of the helpless peasant, ever
ready to pay tribute to foreign warlords to secure a modicum of peace.
     Among Jamsay, to inquire discreetly whether a stranger (within hearing
distance) understands Jamsay, the coded question is su@gu$ ga$n)a@kç$ ma$,
literally “does the francolin (= partridge) scratch the ground?”","[24, 25]"

3.7.4.3    Final-Tone ResyllabificationAs we have seen, an R- or F-tone in a stem-final CvC or Cv˘C syllable is
articulated with the final L-tone component associated with the final C. There
are a few cases, however, where a vowel-initial clitic or suffix is added. This
forces resyllabification, whereby the stem-final sonorant becomes the onset of
the syllable containin the clitic or suffix. For example, R-toned [Cv&C] is a
normal bimoraic syllable in isolation, but adding a suffix -vC forces
resyllabification to [Cv&][C-vC]. This is problematic since the first syllable is
now monomoraic but carries a two-part contour tone.
     The relevant morphological combinations are: a) C-final adjective plus
syllabic postconsonantal suffix allomorphs, usually Sg -in and Pl -um (§4.5.1);
b) any word (usually a noun) plus syllabic allomorph i^˘ of the ‘it is’ or Focus
clitic (§11.2.1).
     Consider first the adjectives in (144). Here I show both the unsuffixed
stem, used in modifying function for nonhuman referents and (for any referent)
as a predicate, and a suffixed Sg form for human singular referents. In (144.c) I
include a long-voweled adjective, in fact the only Cv˘C adjective in my lexicon.
A moraic transcription showing mora-by-mora tone associations, and
syllabification with brackets, are given in addition to regular transcriptions.
                                                                            3.7 Tones   127(144)       gloss            stem                     Sg form        a. ‘firm’            de@N   = [de@N@]         de@N-i@n     = [de@][N-i@n@]        b. ‘confined’        e&m    = [e$m@]          e$m-i@n      = [e$][m-i@n@]        c. ‘cold, slow’      to^m = [to@m$]           to@m-i n

their tones by Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137), which extends the final
tone of the preceding morpheme into the suffix.
     Since (144.a) is all-H-toned, resyllabification in the suffixed forms requires
no tonal modifications. However, in the contour-toned cases (144.b-c),
resyllabification has left behind a monotonal medial syllable. The stem-final
sonorant is now the onset of the word-final syllable. As syllabic onset, it is non-
moraic, and the tone it brings with it to the final syllable cannot be directly
expressed. However, this is moot since Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading
(137) has already copied the tone in question onto the nucleus of the final
syllable.
     Examples of postconsonantal allomorph i^˘ ‘it is’ clitic are in (145).(145)       gloss         stem                      ‘it’s ...’        a. ‘like that’ ci@n                         ci@ni^˘

Resyllabification of the stem-final consonant has no tonal effect on the stem-
final syllable. In (145.b-c), on the other hand, resyllabification deprives the
stem-final syllable of its second tone-component, which is relocated into the
final syllable. The output be$ni^˘ with F-toned clitic instead of #be$ni&˘ $ with
final <LHL> is handled by Clitic <LHL>-Reduction (§3.7.4.7, below). For this
to work, however, it is first necessary to specify that a tone component
associated (after resyllabification) with a syllable-initial consonant is transferred
to the nucleus of that syllable.
128     Phonology
      Of particular interest is the way resyllabification applies to relative-clause
participles ending in Sg -n or Pl -m. Such a participle can have a final-syllable
contour tone under two conditions. First, since all verbs end in an H-toned mora
in their lexical form, the floating L-tone added to the end of the stem to form the
unsuffixed Imperfective ends up being expressed on the suffixal nasal. Thus
/a@˘- L -m/ ‘catch.Impf-Ppl.Sg’ with floating L-tone and Pl Participial -n is
realized as a@˘-m$ [a@am@ $]. Adding the ‘it is’ clitic y$ (postconsonantal allomorph
i^˘), we get a@˘-mi $˘, via the derivation (146).(146)    a.   /[a@˘- L -m] i^˘/    underlying

         e. a@˘-mi $˘              Clitic <LHL>-Reduction     Consider now the unsuffixed Perfective participle corresponding to the
unsuffixed Imperfective participle a@˘-m$ just described. With H(H…)L tone
overlay, we get a^˘-m. Although I distinguish Imperfective a@˘-m$ and Perfective
a^˘-m in transcription, they are homophonous when word-final. However, the
phonological distinction is apparent when the ‘it is’ clitic is added. Whereas
Imperfective a@˘-m$ appears as a@˘-mi $˘ as just seen, Perfective a^˘-m appears as
a^˘-mi^˘. The derivation of this form requires that both tone components of the
stem’s F-tone (i.e. <HL>) be associated with the stem vowel rather than with
the suffixal nasal when the clitic induces resyllabification. This entails ordering
resyllabification before Contour-Tone Stretching (143), which is therefore bled

8.1     Tonal locatives8.1.1     Tonal locative of noun stemA small number of noun stems may be used, as locative adverbs, with an extra
L-tone component grafted onto the end, which results in a final F-toned
syllable or in a …HL contour on the final two syllables. There is no (other)
postposition. In spite of the final F or HL pattern, the tone contours here are
distinct from the exaggerated “dying quail” final intonation pattern (§3.8.3) that
is used with conjoined NPs and for words followed by fu@˘ ‘all’.
     The cases of tonal locative known to me, excluding similar forms confined
to greetings, are listed in (436). The inputs are of the following types: …HH
(436.a), monosyllabic Cv@˘ (436.b), …LH (436.c), monosyllabic Cv&˘ (436.d),
and nasal-final (436.e). There are no cases where a tonal locative is formed
from an (already) …HL or …F input noun, in which cases the tonal locative
would be indistinguishable from the input.(436)       noun           gloss              tonal locative gloss        a. bu@ro@          ‘pond’             bu@ro$          ‘in the pond’

of the input noun, which docks on the noun’s final syllable. The only similar
process is the addition of an L-tone at the end of verb stems to form the
unsuffixed Imperfective stem. In interlinears, the notation “…Loc.HL” will be
used. For the phonology in detail of these two formations, see Tone-Grafting
(§3.7.3.3).
    There is a shred of evidence to the effect that the tonal locative, at least in
specific cases, may still function morphosyntactically as a postposition. See
discussion following example (867), below.
    Textual examples of tonal locatives are in (437).(437)     a. mo$bi^l    o$ju$-ka^˘      ce@je@-sa$-y

           (=your own responsibility).’ 2004.5.1    Ordinarily, tonal locatives may only be formed from nouns, rather than
from modifiers such as adjectives or numerals. (For a rare exceptional case
where a modifying adjective takes tonal locative form, see §8.1.3, below.) The
noun must also be in NP-final position, i.e. not followed by an adjective,
numeral, or particle (including Definite ku$<), with a possible exception
discussed below.
    In a tonal locative, the noun may be preceded by a possessor NP and/or a
compound initial (438.a).(438)   a. E@mE@        dç$ƒç$-u@ro$
           1PlP         Dogon-house.Loc.HL
           ‘(here) in our Dogon country’ (common phrase)        b. [o$ju$-ka$˘    nu@No$]     le$
           [road          Dem]        in
           ‘on this road’     The noun u@ro@ ‘house’ and its tonal locative u@ro$ are ordinarily distin-
guishable. As compound initials, in the main noun-noun compound type with
tone-dropping on the initial, they would both merge as u$ro$-. In e.g.
[a$ƒa$-u$ro$]-ta&N-Ø ‘(bride’s) transfer to her husband’s home’, a compound
ending in a Verbal Noun, the associated VP is a$ƒa$-u@ro$ ta@Na@- ‘move to the
husband’s home’. One could argue, therefore, that the compound initial
[a$ƒa$-u$ro$]- is really a tonal locative whose basic ...HL tone contour has been
erased by an overlaid tone contour. Again, there is no way to demonstrate this
directly.
     The adverbial phrase nu$mo@ nu$mo@ ‘hand to hand’, cf. nu$mo@ ‘hand’, is
used with a verb like ‘give’, indicating that someone delivered something in
person to the recipient (not through an intermediary). For close combat, the
expression used is ‘chest to chest’, which has the same structure: gç$Nç@
286     Postpositions and adverbials
gç$Nç@ cf. gç$Nç@ ‘chest’. I take these to be conjunctions of iterated nouns (e.g.
‘hand and hand’), rather than as iterations of tonal locatives.
    In situational greetings associated with an activity or location (‘well’,
‘work’, ‘market’, etc.), the noun specifying the location in question has a tonal
form consistent with that in tonal locatives. See (1185) and comments there.
    Some postpositions are, or probably originated as, tonal locatives of nouns.
In (439), the HL contour converts a noun into a postposition, with a more
figurative sense than in the preceding cases. The complement takes the form of
a possessor. Textual examples are in (440).(439)         noun     gloss     postposition   gloss          a. ku@˘<     ‘head’    ku^˘<          ‘on the head of; about,

8.1.2     [ko@ X] with tonal locativeThe Nonhuman pronoun ko@ occurs in a construction [ko@ X] with a following
noun like ‘time’ or ‘place’. The resulting phrase may be translated ‘(at) that
time’, but ko@ here is structurally a possessor, hence ‘(at the) time of that’. The
construction should be distinguished from the demonstrative phrase [ko$ X] with
L-toned ko$ (§6.4.1).
                                                              8.1 Tonal locatives   287    The noun following ko@ has the form of a tonal locative. When the noun has
H-tone in the penult, the final two syllables appear as an HL tone sequence. The
other attested example involves an R-toned monosyllable, so the output is bell-
shaped <LHL>. The tonal locative is applied somewhat inconsistently in these
examples, so variants with lexical tones also occur. The data are in (441), the
clear cases with audible differences being (441.a-b). In (441.c), the noun al-
ready has lexical HHL tones, so there is no audible change in the tonal locative.(441)        noun        gloss      with ko@          gloss        a. do@gu@ro@     ‘time’ ko@ do@gu@ru$         ‘(at) that time’

several times with all-H tone on the noun; see e.g. (907.e).","[305, 306, 307, 308, 309]"

13.2.2 WH-interrogativesThe following subsections cover WH (content) interrogatives involving the
senses ‘who?’, ‘what?’, ‘where?’, ‘when?’, ‘how?’, ‘how much/many?’, and
‘which?’ They behave as focalized constituents, and are often (though not
always) followed by the Focus clitic y$. If the clause containing a WH-word
has a perfective positive verb, it normally occurs in the unsuffixed Perfective
(as usual in the focalization construction); examples include (766.a) and (772).
     The WH-interrogative words most often occur clause-initially (if
topicalized constituents are excluded). However, other NPs and adverbials
(whether focalized or not) also occur in this position. The WH-interrogatives
may in fact follow another NP or adverbial that appears to be part of the same
clause, as in (766.a) and (773.a). I conclude that the WH-words remain in situ
rather than being (systematically) fronted.
     The interrogative particle ma, most commonly found in polar inter-
rogatives, is optionally used (redundantly) at the end of WH-interrogative
clauses, as noted in (761), above. Further examples are (768.b) and (770.a).",[486]

15.1.12 Adverb-like chained verbsChaining lends itself to adverb-like modification. Examples of verbs commonly
used in this function are ç@gç@-rç@ ‘be fast, do fast’ and pi@li@we@- ‘go back; do
again’.(892)     a. pi@li@we@  [ç$yç@     nE$]    tç@ƒç@kç$
             go.back [grass        now] sprout.Impfbe.Nonh
             ‘The grass will sprout again.’ 2004.3.6          b. ç@gç@-rç@ ko$       dç@˘kç$       de$ne@-w$<       de$y

             ‘if you-Sg want it (wall under construction) to reach (its endpoint)
             quickly’ 2004.3.25     Another example is with ja$ma@- ‘betray’, which may be glossed adverbially
as ‘treacherously’ in (893).(893)     [da$˘ƒa@ dE@˘-yE$-Ø   de$y] yE$rE@ ja$ma@ lE@jE@-sa$-Ø       de$y
          [night fall-Perf-3SgS if]   come betray push.down-Reslt-3SgS if
          ‘At nightfall, when it (=Hyena) came and treacherously pushed
          (=attacked), …’ 2004.4.3
                                                               15.1 Chaining    53115.1.13 Negation of verb chainsOnly the final verb in a chain may be morphologically negated. In the majority
of cases, there is no difficulty in determining the scope of the negation. If only
the last VP is under negation, a loose chain with me$y< may be used, hence
[VP1 me$y<, VP2-Neg] as in (894).(894)   [na$Na@ E@wE@    me$y<] bu@˘du$    sa$˘-ra@-m
        [cow      buy    and] money        have-Neg-1SgS
        ‘I bought a cow and have no money (left)’   If the negation has wide scope, a simple chain ending in one negative verb
may be used (895).(895)   ni -$ di^˘< nu@˘   di $Ne$-j-e$                      a$ba@da@
        here        enter sit.down-ImpfNeg-3PlS.L            never
        ‘They never come in and sit down here.’     If only the first (or some other nonfinal) VP is negated, there is a
(somewhat cumbersome) way of chaining the clauses using ka@r<a@ me$y< ‘doing’
after a negated verb; see (901.a-c), below. When verbs or VPs are directly
chained without me$y<, the negation most often has wide scope. However,
consider (896).(896)   [d i&˘<   ku$<],     [[i@ne@-n         le$] ja$Na@ me$y<,
        [place Def]          [[person-Sg Dat]       ask    and,
        E@mE@       jE$˘rE@      de$˘ne$-l-a@]
        1PlO        bring        put-PerfNeg-3PlS]
        ‘They (=people of Perge village) didn’t ask anyone and bring and settle
        us (here).’ (i.e., they brought us here to settle without asking anyone
        else for permission) 2004.3.11 [excerpt from (1113.b)]    We can boil this down structurally to the sequence of two VPs followed by
a full clause: [[anyone ask] [us bring] [(us) put-3Pl-Neg]]. The three verbs are
‘ask’, ‘bring’, and ‘put’, with only ‘put’ inflected for negation (and 3Pl subject).
However, the context makes it clear that the bringing and the putting did occur,
while the asking did not. In English, this is best expressed with without in the
negated VP. In the absence of a clause-level ‘without’ construction, the speaker
negated the final verb in the chain, leaving it to the listener to apply contextual
knowledge to piece together the sense. The same text includes other verb-chain
negations of the same type, in the same context (i.e. not first getting permission
before settling). See (907.d) in §15.1.16, below, with linker ti@ rather than me$y<.
532     Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clauses
     (897.a-b) are further examples. The agent does chase or look for, but fails to
catch or find. Therefore the scope of negation is essentially limited to the final
verb ‘reach’ and does not extend to ‘chase’. However, a wide-scope negation
interpretation ([Neg [chase and reach]]) is also logically possible if ‘chase and
reach’ is thought of as a coalesced event type.(897)     a. i $ju@ cE$˘   na$na@ do$˘-go@-Ø                ku$<
             dog thing.L chase reach-ImpfNeg-Ppl.Nonh Def
             ‘what (=animals) the (hunting) dog chases but doesn’t catch’

             ‘what I looked for and (=but) did not find’ (bE$rE@-)     In (898), what is negated is not one or other of the component eventualities,
rather a particular chronological sequence. In the tale, Crane is offered a chance
to eat, but refuses to eat until after it has gone on a mission and come back.
Note the Recent Perfect -jE$ on the chained verb. As in previous examples, only
the final verb is morphologically negated. (The final wa$ is the hearsay quotative
common in tales.)(898)     ku$w<a@     E$nE@    ya&˘ yE$rE@ sç@ƒç^˘-Ø                wa$,

          ‘Crane said, “I will go and come back and (then) eat (by pecking).” It
          said, “I will not go after having eaten,” (it is said).” 2004.4.16
15.1.14 VP-chaining with me$y<A VP with its verb in infinitival (bare-stem) form followed by particle me$y<
may be chained with a following VP (perhaps with inflected verb). Some fairly
long chains with multiple [VP me$y<] constituents occur in texts.
    The particle has variants ma$y< and mE$, and an archaic variant mE@r<E@ was
recorded from an old man (226.e). I generally transcribe me$y< unless the
variant pronunciation is very clear on the tape.
    The particle is sometimes heard with high pitch. When this pronunciation
occurs clause-finally, I attribute the high pitch to nonterminal high intonation
contour  rather than to a phonological H-tone, and accordingly transcribe
me$y<.
                                                                15.1 Chaining    533     There are, however, a few cases where a high-pitched me@y< seems to occur
before a clitic or a clause-final particle, and does not have a convincing
intonational explanation. Here it is necessary to mark the tone as high. See line
1 of (1079) and line 1 of (903).
     For lack of a better gloss, I use ‘and’ in interlinears, but me$y< is not used to
conjoin NPs or other constituents.
     The chained VPs (almost) always have a shared subject. The temporal
relation between the relevant eventualities is variable (anteriority or simul-
taneity). If the VP ending in me$y< denotes a short-duration event, the normal
interpretation is that this event was completed before that denoted by the
following VP. This is the case in (899).(899)   a. [a$na@    ku$<]    n)E&-n       go@˘         me$y<,

           [sa^˘-Ø §15.1.15] 2004.3.17    In (900), the temporal relationship involves at least some overlap. In
(900.a), ‘carry (on head)’ and ‘bring’ overlap, though ‘carry’ focuses on the
onset (when the load is put up on the head), while ‘bring’ focuses on the end-
point. In (900.b), the temporal overlap is complete.(900)   a. … [be@       ne$]      de$˘-ba$,

Rarely, the verb has a nonzero AN suffix. (564.b) has a verb with Recent
Perfect -jE$ followed by me$y<. In (902), two occurrences of Imperfective -tç@ƒç$
occur in a chain ending in me$y<. I have one textual example, however, where
me$y< follows a verb with an AN suffix, namely Imperfective -tç@ƒç$-. The
passage in question comes at a narrative climax, and the VP containing -tç@ƒç$- is
itself repeated.(902)     lE@˘    wo$        ga@˘    ka^n,

majority of textual instances, in (903) it is followed by y$ la$˘ de$y ‘if it is not’
(i.e., ‘unless’ or ‘other than). The final ‘there was none of that’ negates the other
parts of the me$y< chain, but the double negation constituted by the embedded
‘if it is not’ insures that ‘staying on top of the mountain’ is not negated. In
combination with y$, the particle occured in H-toned form me@y<.(903)   [[tu$mo@ ma@na$] be@˘         me@y<]y$< la$˘         de$y,

        (ti@la^y) 2004.3.20     Although nearly all cases of me$y< involve same-subject clause sequences,
occasionally this is not so. It is not clear whether the textual counterexamples
are grammatically significant, however. Since the me$y< clause precedes the
main clause (or the next clause in a more complex chain), there is always the
possibility that the speaker may have incorrectly anticipated the subject of the
following clause. An example is (905), where a string of clauses with the same
human subject, all ending in me$y<, is concluded by a clause with a nonhuman
subject (‘disputes’). The same-subject construction could have been saved if the
speaker had used causative ‘he will bring (the dispute) to an end’, instead of
536     Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clauses
intransitive ‘it (=dispute) will come to an end’. A similar example occurs in

15.2.1.1 Imperfective pseudo-participial clauseIn the examples treated in this section, Pseudo-Participial -n suffix is added to
the unsuffixed Imperfective stem (i.e. the bare stem plus a -L- tonal formative
that docks on a suffix)`. The word-final syllable has F-tone, resulting from
grafting of the floating L-tone of the Imperfective onto the lexical form of the
verb, which always ends in H-tone. The earlier syllables of the verb are H- or
L-toned depending on the verb. If the subject is pronominal, it is expressed by
an L-toned preverbal subject pronominal. Imperfective pseudo-participial
clauses denote prolonged activity (‘keep VERB-ing’), and are often repeated
for emphasis. Typically these are background clauses that lead up to an ‘until
…’ clause or the like, describing the next major event (911.c).

15.2.1.2 Perfective pseudo-participial clauseThe perfective pseudo-participial clause has overlaid H(H…  … )L tone contour on
the verb, as in relatives and other subordinated clauses based on the unsuffixed
Perfective stem (§14.1.13).
     Perfective pseudo-participials in adverbial function are not common. In
(914), which describes the noisy first stage in a collective hunt, the entire
passage is pseudo-participial. There are three perfective pseudo-participial
clauses (verbs ‘go’, ‘follow’, and again ‘follow’), each such clause being paired
with an imperfective participial clause (‘run’ in each case). The perfective-
imperfective pairings involve cause-and-effect relationships, as the advancing
line of villagers making loud noises drives the frightened animals to flight (they
will be met at the other end by hunters). The perfective pseudo-participles are
accompanied by L-toned preverbal subject pronominals. The passage begins
with a lexical-toned pseudo-participial clause (‘be done’), a type described in
the immediately following section. Note that the subject of the “Singular”
544     Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clauses
pseudo-participles is 2Pl, and that there is no head NP suggestive of a true
relative-clause construction.(914)    [pe@˘        tu$tu$˘lu@        si@ne) $] cE$˘        ka^˘<-ka^˘<,

stem pseudo-participial type (discussed in the following section). So (914)
exemplifies all three types of pseudo-participles.
    Perfective Negative -li@-n in (915) also belongs to the pseudo-participial
adverbial type with invariant “Singular” suffix -n. This is shown by the fact that
the protagonists are plural.(915)     [[jE@nE@NE@       ku$<]        do$˘-li@-n]

a verb form ending in suffix -n that looks like the (human) Singular suffix -n,
which is elsewhere added to verb stems only in participial function. There is
another type of pseudo-participial clauses where -n is added directly to the
lexical-toned form of the verb, which cannot happen with true participles. This
type of pseudo-participle is either all-H-toned or L(L…     … )H-toned depending
on the lexical tones of the verb. The -n suffix itself is therefore always H-toned,
since it acquires its tone by spreading from the left. These tone patterns do not
occur in imperfective or perfective pseudo-participles.
     The lexical-stem pseudo-participial is always followed by H-toned de@y, cf.
(atonal) dey ‘if/when’. The H-tone is carried over from the final H-tone of the
pseudo-participle, cf. Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137).
     Another feature of lexical-stem pseudo-participial clauses is that there is no
overt expression of the subject. In particular, L-toned preveral subjects are
strikingly absent. Therefore these “clauses” are better described as subordinated
VPs, similar to chaining constructions such as that with me$y<. However, there
is normally an understood subject, and it need not be coindexed with that of the
following clause.
     In several examples, the pseudo-participial clause denotes an overall
activity in general terms (often with emphasis on the endpoint or objective),
and subsequent clauses may describe individual sub-activities (or even prepar-
atory actions).(916)   a. [ta$ra@            le$],    ya&˘-n         de@y,

15.2.2 Temporal adverbial clauses based on ‘say’ verbs15.2.2.1 Temporal anteriority (ka^n, ga@˘ ka^n ‘after …’)A common clause-type expressing temporal anteriority of a clause vis-à-vis a
following clause ends in ka^n, which I gloss as ‘after’ in interlinears. This is best
interpreted as a reduced and grammatically specialized singular participle of
ka@r<a@-’do’, most likely from (Perfective) participle ka@r<a$-n rather than from
(Imperfective) participle ka@r<a@-n$. The contraction is irregular, and the
morphological structure of ka^n is non-transparent. I will gloss it as ‘after’ in
interlinears, though in free translations ‘when’ is often adequate.
     Preceding verbs are usually chained with ka^n, i.e., they appear in bare-
stem (=infinitival) form. If the subject is pronominal, it appears as an L-toned
preverbal subject pronominal, either directly before ka^n or before a
preceding verb. The fact that the subject pronominal may directly precede ka^n
indicates that ka^n can be treated as a participle.
     In most cases, ka^n (or the extension ga@˘ ka^n, see below) occurs in
conjunction with a switch in subjects (or topics). In this respect, (ga@˘) ka^n
clauses are like jE@ (me$y<) clauses. They therefore contrast with VP chains (with
or without me$y<), which are regularly used when the subject is held constant. A
switch in subjects is observable in the various examples given below. However,
there is often some difficulty in interpreting textual examples, since there are
often two or more adverbial (or other subordinated) clauses preceding a final
main clause, and the higher-level bracketing can be tricky. When adverbial
clause S1 is followed by adverbial clause S2 and then the main clause S3, it is not
always clear whether S1 is locally subordinated to the adjacent S2, or is directly
subordinated to the more distant S3 .
     Simple ka^n without ga@˘ is illustrated in (921). ka^n directly follows the
relevant bare verb stem, except that a preverbal L-toned subject pronominal (if
present) intervenes.

chain-style sequence. Occasionally, the verb is Perfective, in stative sense (922).(922)     [ko$       ma$y<-a^˘ ka@n]i $˘         ko@     ya$Na@-w$<          de$y

          ‘if you-Sg take it after it has dried [focus], …’ (ma$y<a@-) 2004.3.17     In the majority of instances, ka^n is accompanied by a preceding ga@˘ ‘say’, a
verb in infinitival (i.e. chained) form. The interchangeability of ka^n and ga@˘
ka^n is shown by the fact that (921.d), above (‘after another newlywed bride
came’), was repeated by the speaker, after the taping was briefly interrupted,
with ga@˘ ka^n instead of just ka^n.
     Perhaps ga@˘ ka^n originated (like jE@ clauses) as a quotative construction
(‘after X said that a lion has ravaged the animals’), where the act of saying
entails that the protagonists have processed the event in question; see §17.1.
However, in many textual passages there is no suggestion of actual speech or
thought by any discourse referent, and simple free translations like ‘after a lion
had ravaged the animals’ are usually best. To whatever extent the construction
is still felt (by native speakers) to involve quotation (or thought), the source of
the quotation is abstract and impersonal. Therefore ‘say’ in this construction
does not entail the use of logophorics, and the clause preceding ‘say’ has a verb
in bare-stem form, whereas a normal quotative complement has an inflected
verb (§17.1.2).(923)     a. [[e$ju@   ya&˘]      e$           ga@˘]        ka^n

15.2.2.2 Temporal simultaneity (jE@, jE@ me$y< ‘while …’)Another adverbial clause type apparently involving a ‘say’ verb ends with jE@, or
more often jE@ me$y<. Before proceeding, a comment on phonologically similar
morphemes may be helpful. It is likely that some or all of the forms in (924.a)
are historically related, but their connection with those in (924.b) is
questionable.(924)   a. jE$-        ‘say’ (unsuffixed Perfective, §11.3.2)

          b. jE$          ‘holding; with’, reduced from ji@jE$ in chains (§15.1.17)
             -jE$-        Recent Perfect suffix (§10.1.2.6)     Here we are concerned with jE@ and the more common jE@ me$y< in adverbial
clauses. I will gloss jE@ as ‘say’ on the theory that it may still be synchronically
connected to the inflected jE$- ‘say’, and for lack of a better translation. In this
analysis, jE@ is the (bare) lexical form of the ‘say’ verb, which otherwise appears
as L-toned unsuffixed Perfective jE$-. In this analysis, jE@ ‘say’ is chained to the
following clause, with or without me$y<.
     Adverbial clauses ending in jE@ (me$y<) have a range of morphosyntactic
forms. The variables are a) the expression of pronominal subject, and b) the
form of the verb if it is perfective (positive). There are two basic types
involving inflected verbs, i.e. verbs with at least AN marking (925). See (931)
below for an uncommon pattern involving bare verb stems.(925)           pronominal subject                 tone of unsuffixed Perfective          a. quasi-main-clause type
                suffix on verb                     all-L          b. quasi-relative-clause type
                L-toned preverbal pronoun          H(H…)L     Type (925.a) is consistent with main-clause form in most respects. How-
ever, the L-toned unsuffixed Perfective in main clauses is elsewhere associated
with the presence of a focalized constituent, which is not the case in jE@ clauses.
     Type (925.b) is consistent with relative-clause form in most respects.
However, no audible Participial suffix is present on the verb. One might argue
for a Nonhuman Participial suffix -Ø, which would require us to assume a
covert nonhuman head; I will not adopt this suggestion.
     The quasi-main-clause type (925.a) is less common. The clear examples of
this construction have perfective-system verbs or statives, as in (926). I interpret
structurally similar examples involving imperfective (or imperative) verbs to be
purposive clauses (§17.6.2). Note the L-toned unsuffixed Perfective verbs in
(926.a-b) and the presence of regular pronominal-subject suffixes throughout.

(926.b) and in (1236), it is particularly difficult to separate the subordinator jE@
from the unattested #jE@ that arguably underlies unflectable L-toned jE$- ‘say’.
     Perhaps (927) belongs here. The predicate with H-toned jE@ is a noun with
clitic y$ ‘it is’ (allomorph i^˘).(927)   ti -$ ta@˘        [[ko$   ke@]       kç$r-Øi^˘        jE@,

pronominal is more common. It is exemplified in (928). Note subject pro-
nominals throughout, and in (928.a-b) the perfective H(H…)L contour (usually
bisyllabic HL). Another perfective example is the first line in (458.a). There is
no audible participial suffix, but this is interpretable as Nonhuman -Ø. In
(928.a), both of these features are observable in the jE@ me$y< clause. In the jE@
clause that follows, still in (928.a), the verb (‘look for’) is imperfective, so only
the preverbal subject pronominal tells us that the quasi-relative type is at hand.
Similar imperfective clauses occur in (928.c-e). Simple jE@ is present in (928.b),
while the other examples have jE@ me$y<.

             2004.3.25    Some or all of the ingredients in (929) appear to be present with jE@ me$y<.(929)   a.   quotative (‘say’)
        b.   cognitive processing of eventuality by a protagonist
        c.   change of subject (or topic) vis-à-vis the following clause
        d.   simultaneity (durative background clause)     Function (929.a) and its extension (929.b) are consistent with the probable
origin of the jE@ me$y< construction as a quotative (jE@ = ‘say’). A quotative
interpretation is possible in examples (926.b) and (927), above.
     In the cognitive processing interpretation (929.b), the sense can be captured
by the sample formulation “X realized that S1, (then) X …’. Here, referent X
has cognitively processed the eventuality S1, and the same X is a protagonist in
S2. This may be the case in (928.b,d), whose nuances may not be perfectly
captured by the free translation.
     The formulation “X realized that S1 , (then) S2” has the (perhaps accidental)
by-product of favoring subject (or topic) switches. If X is the subject of S2 but
not of S1, a subject switch is at hand. Many, though not all, examples of jE@
me$y< involve a subject switch with respect to the following clause. In this
556     Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clauses
respect, jE@ me$y< is similar to ga@˘ ka^n, both contrasting sharply with me$y<
(which assumes same subjects across chain boundaries).
    However, neither quotative, cognitive processing nor subject-switch
account for all the examples of jE@ me$y<. In many cases, jE@ me$y< functions as a
durative background clause, translatable ‘while …’ (928.a,c,f). Additional
examples are (930.a-b).(930)     a. ti -$ ta@˘ [ko$         ya@ra$-Ø                       jE@  me$y<],

quasi-relative constructions, is for the adverbial clause to end in a bare verb
stem, in effect being chained with jE@ in its verbal function ‘say’. Here a
purposive element (intention) is clear, and a comparison with Purposive
postposition jE@ is pertinent. The clause before jE@ is reduced to a subjectless VP,

11.2.2.2 Locational quasi-verbs (wç$- or kç$, usually without yE@)To indicate that an entity is present in some location, one may use the quasi-
verbs whose inflected forms are given in (665). The quasi-verb wç$-, which
takes subject suffixes for the full range of human referents, is formally an
unsuffixed Perfective in defocalized L-tone form. This could be taken as
evidence that the accompanying locational expression is treated as focal, even in
the absence of a Focus clitic. Suffixally marked forms of the (positive)
perfective system (-ti -$ , -sa$-, -a^˘-, -jE$-, -tE@rE$-) are not possible. Imperfectives are
extremely rare, only a single instance of wç@˘-tç@ƒç$- occurring in my textual
corpus; see (685) in §11.2.2.5, below.(665)             category       form         a.       1Sg            wç$-m

form wç$-Ø. Animals as well as plants and inanimates and abstractives require
kç$ (except where animals are personified in tales). I gloss kç$ as ‘be.Nonh’, and
wç$- as ‘be.Hum’ in interlinears, since the nonhuman/human opposition is sharp
here. Indeed, there is a striking resemblance between wç$- and kç$, on the one
hand, and the pronouns wo@ (human 3Sg) and ko@ (Nonhuman).
     An H-toned form wç@- for the human quasi-verb is arguably lexically basic,
though it actually occurs as such only in lexical-stem pseudo-participial wç@-n
(§3.7.1.1, §15.1.1.3).
     Examples, illustrating the regular use of these forms with overt locational

with mounds in rows, rather than with long furrows bounded by ridges.
Postposition le$ can mean ‘in’ or ‘with’ (§8.2.1)(668)   [nu$mo@ ma$ wç$-tu@mo@]y$< de$y ju$go@-w$]

vowel of wç$- or kç$ must be lengthened (Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141)) to
accomodate the contour tone.

locational ‘be’ and existential ‘be’ is neutralized in relatives.

          ‘Last year he was here.’     For specifically future time reference, an alternative expression must be
used, e.g. with a regular verb like tE@mE@-w<E@- ‘be found’.
     A preceding Existential yE@, in the assimilated form yç@, is sometimes present
in locational function (671). However, the combinations yç@wç$- and especially
yç@kç$ are more systematically used in existential function. There is, moreover,
evidence that yç@ (i.e. yE@) is associated with the absence of a focalized preverbal
constituent (§11.2.2.1). Since wç$- and kç$ as ‘be’ quasi-verbs are already in
unsuffixed Perfective form (which is used for other verbs in focalization
constructions), they cannot otherwise change in form to reflect the presence of a
focalized constituent.(671)     a. u@ro$            yç@wç$-m

they follow adjective stems in adjectival predicates (§11.4.1, below). They can
also be used with numerical predicates, as in (672).(672)   e@       [n)E-& m      na&y<]           wç$-be$     de$y,

11.2.2.3 Cliticized wç$- or kç$ after inflected verb or ‘it is’ cliticOccasionally, cliticized wç$- or kç$ is found after an inflected verb. A
distinction must be made between constructions where the verb is inflected only
for a marked AN category, and those where the verb has both AN (even if zero)
and pronominal-subject inflection. The distinction is not audible for 3Sg
subject.
     Where a verb allows both active and resultative-stative interpretations of the
Perfective, the resultative-stative sense verb may be guaranteed by adding wç$-
‘be’ (or nonhuman kç$). Compare (673.a) with (673.b). The latter has double
pronominal-subject inflection.(673)   a. i@j-a^˘-m

           ‘I am already standing.’    wç$- or kç$ (or reduplicated variant) may also be used after a marked
Imperfective verb with suffix -tç@ƒç$- (§10.1.2.10). In this combination, only the
‘be’ quasi-verb has pronominal-subject inflection (674). The addition of the
‘be’ quasi-verb emphasizes prolongation of the activity. (674.a) has Ci $-

predication with clitic y$ (allomorph i^˘). Parallel examples with e.g. 1Sg
wç$-m ‘I am’ after y$ were elicited, but it may be that the construction is mainly

i^˘) can also function as the Focus clitic. I do not think that y$ has focalizing
function here, but the possibility cannot be excluded. In (677), focalization is
present (ci@n ‘thus’ is commonly focalized). I therefore do not consider (677)

(instead of the usual Perfective Negative -li@-) is elsewhere observed only with
‘have’ (positive -sa$-, negative sa$˘-ra@-, §11.5.1). These quasi-verbs are limited to
the perfective system, so they allow no morphological distinction between
Perfective Negative and Imperfective Negative. In this respect they are like
adjectival predicates, which have a single Negative (not marked for aspect) -la@-.
The phonological similarity between -rv@- and -la@- is historically suggestive.

construction, kç$˘-rç@ is usually generalized to human as well as nonhuman
reference: ‘anyone who didn’t go, he/it doesn’t exist (kç$˘-rç@)’ = ‘everyone
went’. See §14.1.2.

17.3.4.2 Recognition (inference, hearsay) constructionA different construction of the type ‘see that [proposition]’ denotes recognition
(involving inference or deduction) rather than witnessing (simple perception).
Here, instead of a relative-clause complement, we get one with ordinary AN-
                                        17.3 Factive (indicative) complements   609inflected verbs (any aspect, positive or negative). As in the previous direct-
perception examples, there is no pronominal-subject suffixation on the verb.
However, now a pronominal subject shows up not as an L-toned preverbal
subject pronominal, rather as an H-toned independent pronoun (1036.a-b).
     In my interpretation, the complement no longer has a participle (with
unexpressed nonhuman head), rather a verb inflected for AN but not
pronominal-subject category. In other words, the complement clause is similar
to the subject-focalization construction, except that (in my data) the overt Focus
clitic y$ is not present on the independent pronoun in subject function. (1036.a)
is perfective negative, while (1036.b) is an imperfective negative. (1036.c) has
the ‘it is’ clitic y$ (postconsonantal i^˘). (1036.d), with the same meaning, is a
standard adjectival predicate with ‘be’ quasi-verb.(1036) a. [u@     ya$˘-li@-Ø]     E@˘-ra$-m

17.3.5 ‘It doesn’t matter (much) that’ (sa$˘-ra@-Ø)sa$˘-ra@-Ø means ‘it doesn’t have’ (§11.5.1). In this invariant form, it may be
placed after a main-like clause (i.e. a factive complement) in the sense ‘it
doesn’t matter (much) that …’. There may be two mutually exclusive factives,
resulting in a parallel construction. (1038) is from a passage about how a
respectable older man keeps an eye out for a potential bride for a younger man
while visiting other villages.(1038) ye@ri^˘       yE$rE$-Ø             ta$Na$         sa$˘-ra@-Ø,

17.3.6 Factive obligational (wa@˘ji@bi $ ‘obligation’)The Fulfulde (ultimately Arabic) noun wa@˘ji@bi $ ‘obligation, duty’ is used as a
predicative nominal with clitic y$ ‘it is’. The following clause has an
imperfective or imperative verb. In effect, wa@˘ji@bi     $ y$ functions like an
adverbial. Alternatively, the complement may appear as a topicalized Verbal
Noun clause, with following wa@˘ji@bi $y$ ‘it is a duty’.(1039) a. [n)u@˘    ke@]    wa@˘ji@bi 

11.2    ‘Be’, ‘become’, and other stativesUnder this rubric I consider a range of defective verbs, quasi-verbs, clitics, and
morphologically regular verb stems that have stative (and inchoative) senses,
revolving around ‘be’ and ‘become’.
     Defective verbs (with meanings like ‘have in one’s possession’ and ‘be
sitting’) have incomplete paradigms. For example, in positive clauses they occur
only in the unsuffixed Perfective (L-toned sem, no AN suffix). See §11.2.4
(stance verbs) and §11.5.2 (verbs of possession). Quasi-verbs are a set of
morphemes with shapes Cv- and Cvn- (not otherwise allowed for verb stems)
that, like the defective verbs, fail to allow aspectual suffixation. Of the quasi-
verbs covered in this section (§11.2), the locational-existentials wç$- and kç$ are
arguably pronominals rather than verbs morphologically (§11.2.2.2-4), while
ku$n- ‘be in’ is more verb-like (cf. ku@no@- ‘put in’). These quasi-verbs have
special Negative forms with suffix -rv@- (postvocalic) or -v@ (postconsonantal).
     Also covered here are the morphologically regular verbs be@˘- ‘remain,
happen’ and ta@Na@- ‘become, happen’ (§11.2.6.1-2) since they verge
semantically on the other ‘be’-type elements treated here. There is also a section
on the expression di g  $ E$-la@- ‘doesn’t connect’ (§11.2.5).
     y$ ‘it is’ and allomorphs is a pure clitic. In addition, ‘be’ and ‘be in’ quasi-
verbs are cliticized to a preceding word or particle under some conditions. The
criterion for recognizing clitics is any telltale phonological interaction with the
preceding element (§3.6).
                                         11.2 ‘Be’, ‘become’, and other statives   40311.2.1 Copula clitic ‘it is …’ (y$, i $˘)11.2.1.1 Unconjugated positive formsThis important clitic is used in the ‘it is Y’ construction, identifying or
describing a contextually understood (but unexpressed) referent, which may be
concrete (a person or object) or abstract (e.g. a situation). This may be expanded
into ‘X is Y’, where a subject (or topic) X is further identified or described. The
clitic is essentially a copula, and it is functionally distinct from the ‘be’ quasi-
verbs that are used in existential and locational functions (‘there is X’, ‘X is
[here/there]’). Most often it is unconjugated, though the “unconjugated” form
could be taken as having (zero) 3Sg agreement. This subsection covers positive
unconjugated forms; following subsections present overtly conjugated forms,
and negative counterparts of both types. For the use of the clitic in focalization
constructions, see §13.1.
     The clitic may take the surface forms y$, y$<, i $˘, and i^˘, depending on
what segment the preceding word ends in, whether the nearest consonant to the
left is nasal or nasalized or not, and on what the immediately preceding tone is.
The key allomorphic division is between postvocalic y$ (also used after {y y<})
and postconsonantal i^˘. For the phonology, see §3.6.1.
     The ‘it is Y’ construction is illustrated in (647).(647)   [ç$w<ç$-sa&y< ku$<] [a$-ni^˘          de$y], [a$r<a$-lç$gu@       le$]

        ‘(In) the cemetery, if it (=the dead person) is a man, the male drum
        style, that (drumstyle) is what they (=tomtom beaters) will go with; if it
        is a woman, the female drum style is what they will go with.’ (a&-n,
        n)E&-n)     In (647), from a general text about mortuary practices, prior discourse has
made it clear that an unspecified person has died. The conditional a$-ni^˘ de$y
might be more fully glossed as ‘if (the situation is that) it is a man’ or ‘in the
event that it is a man’ (French s’il s’agit d’un homme). The relevant passage is
followed by the parallel ‘if (it is the situation that) it is a woman’. There is thus
here, as often (especially in conditional antecedent contexts), an ambiguity as to
whether the copula is predicated of a referential (though unexpressed) entity, or
whether the copula has scope over an entire proposition, which can then be
analysed as a factive complement (‘it’s the case that […]’); see §17.3.
404     VP and predicate structure
      Further examples of the ‘it is Y’ construction: (392.a) and (499) (‘it’s an
obligation’ = ‘must’ or ‘certainly’), (393) (‘if it’s [=if we’re talking about] the
past’), (452.c) (‘if [the situation is that it’s] in the sauce pot’), (668) in §11.2.2.2
(‘if it’s [=if we’re talking about] (making) ridges’), (975) in §16.1.3 (‘if it’s [=if
we’re talking about] birds’), (976) in §16.1.3 (‘it’s the truth’).
      The ‘X is Y’ construction with two overtly expressed discourse referents is
illustrated in (648). One could argue that the first NP is a presentential topic NP,
in which case ‘X is Y’ is really ‘(as for) X, it is Y’, and the two-NP construction
reduces to the single-NP version described above.(648)     a. ta$ra$-nç$w<ç@           [cE$˘     pç$rba@]y$

   An independent pronoun may be the complement of y$ (649). The clitic
may also take a PP or other adverbial as its complement (650).(649)     [wo$     ke@]      mi@y$         la$˘

11.2.1.2 Conjugated formsWhen the first argument in the ‘X is Y’ construction is expressed by a noun-
headed NP, one could argue that it is a topic phrase, perhaps pre-sentential.
However, it is possible to conjugate y$ to agree with a subject, showing that
the first argument can in fact be grammatically part of the clause containing the
clitic and the second argument. While y$ is the default form of the clitic, in the
                                        11.2 ‘Be’, ‘become’, and other statives   405conjugated system it can function as the 3Sg (including Nonh) subject form.
The paradigm is given in (651). There is no specifically Nonhuman form.(651)   category          postconsonantal               postvocalic

        3Pl          i $˘-ba$        i^˘-ba$         y$-ba$     In the postvocalic forms (rightmost column), we observe the y$ of the ‘it
is’ clitic in the 2Pl, 3Sg/Nonhuman (zero suffix), and 3Pl forms. These involve
simple addition of the regular pronominal-subject suffix to the postvocalic
allomorph of the clitic. By contrast, the 1Sg, 2Sg, and (ambiguously) 1Pl forms
are reduced to the segmental form of the pronominal-subject suffix (atonal -m,
-w, -y), but acquire the L-tone of the (segmentally deleted) y$ clitic. Perhaps
the historical driver of this reduction came in the 1Pl, whose original *y$-y$ may
have been the first conjugated clitic to reduce to just a consonant.
     The postconsonantal forms show similar patterns. For the special L-toned
forms used when the preceding word ends in an F-toned syllable, see Clitic
<LHL>-Reduction (155) (§3.7.4.7). The F-toned conjugated clitics used after
other preceding words can be taken as basic. This still leaves us with two
distinct clusters. 3Sg and Nonhuman i^˘ is phonetically identical to the
unconjugated clitic (postconsonantal allomorph), and may be represented as
i^˘-Ø. 3Pl i^˘-ba$ and 2Pl i^˘-be$ simply add (syllabic) pronominal-subject
suffixes to this.
     The other cluster centers around the 1Sg and 2Sg, with 1Pl again
ambiguous. 1Sg u^m could be derived from /i^˘-m/ by amalgamating the tone
of the clitic with the segmental form of the pronominal, hence /m^/. In
postconsonantal position, this requires one further step, an allomorphic vocalic
extension to u^m. Compare postvocalic Sg -n and Pl -m with adjectives, but
postconsonantal -in and -um with -vC shape (§4.1.1). The conjugated 2Sg clitic
likewise is derived as follows: /i^˘-w/ > /w^/ > /u^w/. However, it needs a final
rule, Monophthongization (93) to u@˘, see §3.5.7.2. The 1Pl postconsonantal
form, though homophonous to the unconjugated form (and therefore also to the
406     VP and predicate structure
3Sg and Nonhuman form), can be derived in a manner parallel to that of the 2Sg
form, ending with Monophthongization: /i^˘-y/ > /y^/ > /i^y/.
     It is possible to add a cliticized form of the ‘be’ quasi-verb after y$, instead
of the conjugated forms given above. In practice, this is uncommon, and is
chiefly implemented with 3Sg wç$-Ø, hence …y$wç$-Ø. In effect, this
provides the 3Sg with a conjugated form of y$ that is audibly distinct from the
unconjugated form. See (676) in §11.2.2.3 for y$wç$-Ø.
     The conjugated variants undergo the same tone rules that apply to
unmarked y$. Examples with a&-n ‘man’, i^-n ‘child’, their plurals a$r<-u@m and
u@r<-u$m, the woman’s name pa$nta@ (singular only), and the political-party name
Adema (plural), are in (652).(652)          category ‘man/men’           ‘child/children’ ‘Fanta/Adema’         a.    1Sg       a$nu^m            i@-nu$-m          pa$nta@m$

‘nothing if not X’, which logically reduces to ‘only (=exclusively) X’. The
predilection in Jamsay for such double negations to express ‘only’ accounts for
the relatively low text frequency of the ‘only’ particle sa&y (§19.4.1). In (656),
for example, ‘eloping’ is not really a truth-conditional subset of ‘tying
(=contracting) marriage’. The logically complete version would be ‘there was
no contracting marriage; (there was no marriage) if it was not (=other than)
eloping’, but the parenthesized clause is omitted.(656)     ya$˘ji ˘$ -pa$g-u@   [gu$j-Øi^˘            la$˘   de$y] kç$˘-rç@

With nonzero pronominal suffix, both a long-voweled type with la$˘- and a
short-voweled type with la$- are attested.
    Most examples have the short-voweled form la$-. In this construction, the
y$ clitic has the ‘it is’ (copular) function. The clitic may or may not also be
conjugated. In (657), only the Negative morpheme is conjugated.(657)     a$ƒa@     [wo$    de^˘      be@]y$ wo@     o^˘,

        Sg (=the woman) are not the authority.’ 2004.4.11    By contrast, in (658), both y$ ‘it is’ and the Negative morpheme are
conjugated. Since ba^˘< ‘owner’ is vowel-final, the relevant instance of y$ is
phonologically fused with 2Sg suffix -w as w$ (then nasalized to w$<).(658)   [ja@ma@˘y$<] ba@˘<w$<      la$-w        ta@n

        2004.3.11     The 2Pl counterpart given by my assistant is (659). He did not like a
proposed version with double 2Pl marking (i.e. with na@mi^˘-be$), suggesting
that double conjugation is somewhat restricted.(659)   [ja@ma@˘y$]   na@mi^˘           la$-be$      ta@n

        ‘if you-Pl are not members of a crowd [focus], …’     If only the short-voweled type were found, one might use it as evidence that
Negative la$˘ was originally contour-toned. This would account for the long
vowel before zero suffix, and the short vowel before a (moraic) suffix that could
express the second tone component without lengthening the vowel; see
Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141).
     The type with long-voweled la$˘- occurred in elicitation (660). My assistant
consistently pronounced the long vowel, in contrast to the short vowel of the
preceding examples. The ‘it is’ clitic itself is not conjugated here. I suggest that
the difference between the two constructions is that in the long-voweled type,
the clitic y$ is the Focus marker (or perhaps jointly ‘it is’ and Focus).(660)   a. tç@˘w<ç@y$<         la$˘-be$       de$y

          ‘They [topic], it is not only (=not all of them are) Algerians.’ 2004.5.2    The sense here is compatible with ‘it is’ clitic y$, but I hear no such clitic
on sa$y (L-toned variant of sa&y ‘only’). If y$ were present, we would get sa&yy$,
and the Negative would be long-voweled la$˘, as in (655.b), above.
    L-toned la$ is perhaps identical morphemically to Negative la@- with statives
(§11.4.3), rather than to the long-voweled la$˘ found after y$. If so, the tone-
dropping is due to predicate defocalization, as is reasonable after a (naturally
focal) ‘only’ phrase.","[424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432]"
