 1.3.4.1     WH       Movement
            Question words in Zuni are marked with the suffix -p (for more on the form of question words, see Chapter 2 Section 2.5).                         Question words undergo movement to the front of the Zuni clause, (43).

           In fact, Zuni     has multiple WH                  movement,       since all question      words   present
undergo movement,           (44a).    As (44b) indicates, the moved question words appear in thesame relative order as their argument structure positions, namely subject - indirect object- direct object.",[42]

          In a final section of this chapter I turn to the question of the Extended ProjectionPrinciple and how its requirements are fulfilled in Zuni constructions with no apparentstructural subject.     I consider the parameterization of the EPP vs. the alternative that anobject inside the VP somehow satisfies the EPP in Zuni.,[135]

"              Returning to the questions posed above, I conclude that VP-internal positions inZuni are deficient somehow because of the movement of V out of VP45: since Zuni weakpronouns         are excluded       from    syntactically deficient contexts,             V movement     triggers
obligatory weak pronoun movement out of VP.                          The second part of that question, whichasked why Zuni weak pronouns should be required to move out of syntactically deficientpositions, can be addressed at the same time as the question of why weak pronouns mustmove into functional specifier positions.                   Earlier I characterized contexts as ‘syntacticallydeficient’ if functional categories involved were either absent or inaccessible in somesense to the pronoun.           This suggests that functional categories are somehow essential to45 Section 2.4 will reconcile how functional categories and the lexical category V can play similar roles in
this respect.",[74]
"             Examples (18a-c) below illustrate the use of Zuni strong subject, object, and
 possessive pronouns as single word (bare) responses to questions.                          No other clausal
 material accompanies the pronoun in this usage.33 Weak pronouns are excluded from this context.",[58]
"
4.1     Inflection and Lexical Structure
          It is an interesting question whether inflection can in fact indicate somethingabout the lexical structure of verbs.           Inflection is generally considered to be the spelloutof syntactic features whose appearance is determined by surface structure relations (cf.",[208]
"         As a    first attempt to answer this question, I note that the behavior of weakpronouns in Zuni is reminiscent of weak pronoun movement in Swedish as described by
Holmberg (1991)4?.           Swedish weak pronoun movement appears to be correlated with
verb movement.         As (39a) illustrates, when V has moved to I, weak pronouns obligatorilymove out of the VP.          Swedish strong pronouns, however, remain inside the VP despite Vmovement in (40b).43                                                                              ’

41 Nichols (1996) suggested a different account, which this dissertation supersedes.
42 While this phenomenon is referred to by Holmberg (1991) as object shift, others (e.g. Josefsson 1992,
Bobaljik & Jonas 1996, Thrdinsson 1997) have argued that weak pronoun movement in Swedish does not
involve movement to a specifier position.
43 Note the contrast with Zuni: Strong pronouns in Zuni never occur as arguments of the clause. This point
will be discussed below in Section 2.4).",[71]
"         The question therefore remains as to where the Zuni weak pronouns are movingto.   It appears that when Zuni weak pronouns move out of the VP, they are moving to aposition somewhere in IP, since as (25a) illustrates, they appear               to the right of an objectquestion word k’ap         that has undergone WH         movement     to SpecCP         (cf.   the clausestructure assumed in Section        1.3.5).     (25b) shows the unacceptability of the pronounmoving to the left of the WH word.",[63]

              The distribution of Zuni WH             words is similar to that of the pronouns.            Strong WH
 words occur in syntactically deficient contexts such as single word questions, (106), and as predicates, (107).           The weak form of the WH               word cannot occur here.","[118, 119]"
"
2.5.1    Zuni Multiple WH Movement
           I have argued that the licensing requirement of pronominal features accounts forthe movement undergone by weak pronouns in certain syntactic contexts.                In particular,
the analysis accounts         for the distribution of short and long pronoun       forms in Zuni,
including the obligatory movement of weak pronouns.             It is noteworthy, therefore, that in
Zuni in addition to pronouns, question words also appear to have strong and weak formsin Zuni.     These are listed in (105).",[118]

4.2.5 Summary and Conclusion
           In this section I suggested that there is a third type of agreement in Zuni, which Ihave referred to as fe- agreement.               te- agreement consists of agreement features spelledout on the lexical head like L-agreement described earlier but instead marks the feature[-referential].         te-    agreement identifies non-thematic elements in syntactic argument
                                                  261
 positions.   These non-thematic elements occur not only in subject position but also in object position.   The evidence presented here allows us to settle the question of whether there can be true expletives in object position.","[275, 276]"

           All three of these statements              or assumptions               concerning     the nature of Zuni
pronouns can be challenged.                In doing so we reveal a rich morphosyntactic system whoseanalysis         will have       implications     beyond       Zuni     itself.    I focus     here on the first two
statements; the third is more innocuous.27           First of all, as indicated in the table and contrary to Newman's statement, object oraccusative forms do have long forms.                  These can be found when the accusative pronounis used as a bare response to a question, as in (2).28 I will return to this evidence shortly.",[49]

          With this evidence in mind, note that examples (100a), (101a-c) and (102a) aboveprovide important evidence bearing on the question of whether the EPP is a parameterthat varies cross-linguistically and therefore whether (103)-(104) indicate that the EPPmay simply not apply to Zuni.        (100a), (10la-c) and (102a) all indicate that null expletivesubjects are indeed required in certain contexts in Zuni, indicating that the EPP does in
fact hold in Zuni.","[202, 203]"
"The distribution of object expletives in these two languages cuts across distinctions madeby object it in English.           Note also that while object it is optional in constructions like(93) above, the agreement indicating the presence of a non-thematic object pro                             in Zuniand     Tiwa        in examples    like   (99)    and    (100)    (te-   agreement      and   na-    agreementrespectively) is obligatory.          Finally, unlike the cases of English object it discussed byRothstein, the Zuni and Tiwa object pro                 in question is non-thematic and has no semanticinterpretation.         Rothstein’s account is therefore not adequate for these cases, and we aretherefore forced to look to an alternative explanation.

" 2.4.2 Movement and Licensing in Specifiers
         I have argued that functional (i.e. case) features associated with some lexical head have the ability to license weak pronouns in situ. If the lexical head in question is moved
 out of this minimal domain, however, this movement will have the effect of disrupting
the licensing relationship between that head and a weak pronoun.                                     This is the case whenthe verb moves out of VP.             The weak pronoun is no longer licensed in situ by features ofthe verb, therefore the pronoun must move to the domain of another potential licenser ofpronominal features.",[114]

assigned.       If Zuni unaccusatives and passives have the structure hypothesized in (52)above, this leaves us with the question                      of how exactly structural accusative case isassigned in these constructions.","[168, 169]"

 3.2.2.3     Evidence Against Null Subjects
            The question of whether there is some phonologically null element in structural
 subject position of Zuni unaccusatives and passives is an interesting one, since the presence of such an element would suggest that these constructions are akin to canonical
 transitive clauses.        Based on the evidence discussed in the last section, I assume that the accusative        arguments     of Zuni     unaccusatives    and   passives    are   structural   objects.
 Therefore evidence of a null element in subject position would render the assignment of structural accusative case to this object no different than its assignment                     in a more
 straightforwardly transitive clause.","[161, 162]"
"            Note that the bare pronoun in Zuni is assigned the same case the pronoun would receive in that grammatical role in a full clause.34

complete clausal representation all of which except for the pronoun is deleted.

indicate.",[58]

3.5 Satisfying Requirements of the EPP in Zuni Unaccusatives and Passives
       In this final section I return to the question of structural subjects in Zuni, and inparticular their absence    in unaccusative       and passive constructions.        If, as the Zunievidence in Section 3.2 and the discussion in Section 3.3 indicate, the internal argumentcan remain     in object position to receive       accusative   case, what is the status of theExtended Projection Principle in Zuni?       I will assume the form of the EPP as proposed inBorer (1986)    and   adapted   in Manzini    (1992)   and   Chomsky    (1995b).     This   proposalassumes that the EPP is not a requirement that there be an obligatory subject position(obligatory SpecIP position) and that this position must be filled. Rather, Borer proposedthat the EPP be understood in terms of the selectional properties of I°:             some elementmust be present that satisfies the selectional properties of I°.        As adapted by Chomsky(1995b:232) this means that the inherent features of I° (D-features) must be checked.",[199]
"         In patterning like structural objects, the arguments of Zuni passives and infinitivesare therefore unlike Icelandic unaccusative and passive arguments (which behave likesubjects) and more like German arguments of passives with non-structural (oblique) case,(42a).   As in Zuni, these German arguments cannot for example occur as an arbitraryPRO subject, (42b) (Zaenen, Maling & Thrdinsson       1985).(42)a.

"         To summarize the discussion of weak pronouns in this section, I have argued thatweak pronoun movement can be characterized syntactically as DP movement out of the
                                         56
 VP into the specifiers of functional projections of IP, and that the order of the pronouns is determined by a ""shortest move"" constraint on pronoun movement.4!
          In the beginning of this section I argued that Zuni strong pronouns                     occur in
 syntactically deficient contexts (bare response, predication, coordination) and showed that the weak pronouns are excluded from these contexts.                We can add to this the fact that weak    pronouns      move     obligatorily    out of the VP      into some      specifier of IP.       This
 observation can be broken down into two parts to ask why the weak pronouns must move out of VP, and why they must move to a functional specifier position.                    I will attempt to address the first part of this question first.
          Since weak         pronouns    in Zuni   are restricted from       occurring    in syntactically
deficient contexts, I suggest that weak pronouns must move out of the VP because theseVP internal positions are syntactically deficient somehow.                 This proposal itself has two
parts: how      are VP-internal         positions deficient, and     why    should     weak   pronouns     be
required to move out of them?","[70, 71]"

 1.3.2.4     The Structure of Noun Phrases
            Elements of the noun phrase occur in the order determiner/possessor - quantifier -N - adjective.      This is illustrated in (34a-c).(34)a.     lukkya   temta        ‘a:-c'ana           these     all         pl.-small(ones)           ""All these children'b.         hom                    temia            Cawe            lsg.acc.(poss.)        all             children           ‘All my children’b.         hot      ko:wi            teSokya_c’ana           indef.   little.bit       hollow           small           ‘in some little hollow'                                                                 [Bunzel 1933]
                                                          23
            In addition,      it seems       that no more        than one adjective can occur with a noun         - compare (35a) and (35b) - nor can adjectives be conjoined as nominal modifiers with the coordinating conjunction tap                 ‘and’, (36).      Since adjectives are stative predicates in Zuni and can take verbal morphology, cf. Silowa-‘kya                        red-past ‘it was red’, the only method
 of combining them involves the formative a separate clause headed by one of the stative predicates, to which the other stative predicated is subordinated with the subordinate suffix -n.        This is illustrated in (37).         This stative predicate clause then is used to referanaphorically to the noun in question by means of the anaphoric particle /e’ .

"When      an NP moves         to the position occupied by [e] in (56c-d), the NP will receivenominative case.         The NP has no opportunity to receive accusative case even if it isassignable in these structures, because it must move out of the accusative position tosatisfy the Extended          Projection Principle condition            on subjects.        Marantz      therefore
hypothesizes       : “since     objects     may    freely    solve    the   subject     requirement       through
movement, it misleadingly appears as if objects are not licensed (assigned case) if there isno subject.”
           !44 145
144 Sigurdsson (1992) argues for a variation on Marantz's analysis, namely that NPs do not raise for case
reasons but rather because ‘it is impossible to keep two potential chains ‘chain distinct’ if their structural
relationship meet the general structural condition on chain formation and if they do not have any distinct
features. In other words, chains must combine or be visibly distinct, Structurally or featurally.’
145 The issues are not necessarily this simple. For example, some languages may allow either movement
or the insertion of an expletive subject (cf. Icelandic examples (21a) and (22) in Section 3.2.1.3), or
insertion of expletive subjects in a variety of constructions (transitives, unaccusatives, and/or unergatives
(e.g. (i) below for the last where it is not clear that satisfaction of the EPP is the driving force). In addition,
expletive constructions are restricted to unaccusative intransitives in some languages but yet in other
languages allowed in a variety of intransitive construction types. The issue is further complicated by the
                                                  157
                    Similarly, other evidence held to confirm Burzio's Generalization can be shown to  be uninformative on the question of the structural case assigning properties of verbs.                               For
  example, we can reinterpret the unacceptability of unaccusatives with pseudo objects.","[171, 172]"

77 As expected for strong pronoun, the Kashmiri independent pronouns allow case matching when
occurring as bare replies to questions, (i). That is, the case on the response form of the pronoun is the same
case that would appear on the pronoun in the same function in a complete clause.(i)a.    Who will kick the dog?         = ---        bI         (Isg. abs.)
b.       Who will the dog bite?          —          me         (isg. dat.)
c.       Who kicked the dog?             _          me         (1sg. erg.)Contrast English, (ii), where accusative case is found on all bare response forms of pronouns. (This
difference will be discussed in Section 2.5).(ii)a. Who will feed the dog?         — me
    b. Who will the dog bite?        — me

            I now tum directly to the Kashmiri person feature hierarchy.                A person hierarchy constraint operates in Kashmiri such that subject person features must outrank object person features.         Person features in Kashmiri are ranked            Ist > 2nd > 3rd.        A curious
 property of this constraint is that Kashmiri displays hierarchy effects in only non-past tenses.     I will argue that hierarchy effects are only found in non-past tenses because (i) the mechanism          responsible for hierarchy effects involves            the comparison        of person
 features of arguments that are visible to one another, (ii) subject person features are rendered non-visible in past tenses, and (iii) case features are responsible for rendering person features non-visible to one another.              In other words, a formal mechanism78 is
 behind the Kashmiri person hierarchy constraint and the presence of case features in K° has an effect on this mechanism.","[99, 100]"

(23)     [jp pro    [,Tns, Agr] [yp     V NP]]         Because this null pro          subject is assumed by Maling & Sigurjénsdéttir to beassigned an agentive thematic role, it is predicted to be interpreted with indefinite orgeneric reference.

In particular, is there some phonologically null element, either a null expletive       or null indefinite pro         in structural   subject    position   of the Zuni constructions?      At least in the case of the latter (i.e. null indefinite pro ), the assignmentof structural accusative case in these Zuni constructions would be unproblematic.","[148, 149]"

2.2 Toward a Theory of Pronominal Structure and Licensing
         Here I will discuss the derivational account of pronominal licensing proposed byCardinaletti    & Starke (1994) and present evidence from O'odham and Belfast English thatwould    seem to contradict their proposals.          In subsequent sections I will present an
alternative    theory of pronouns      structure and licensing that attempts          to avoid these
problems.",[75]
"          Only pronouns that are strong and therefore are otherwise licensed (i.e. have theadditional licensing head F*) should be able to show true default case in bare responsecontexts.      The licensing requirements of weak pronouns will require the selection ofaccusative!©l case in contexts where no other potential licenser is available.                          In bare
responses, any default case specification (or case specified somehow in a clausal structure
that is then deleted) will be overridden on bare weak pronouns in favor of accusative casebecause of the licensing properties of accusative.                   Therefore we should find never findlanguages with only bare nominative weak pronouns but only bare accusative weakpronouns for all possible responses in a language;!0? languages with strong accusativepronouns      f.a.p.r. or strong nominative pronouns                 f.a.p.r.;    and languages with strong
matching-case        pronouns      f.a.p.r.    in bare   response        forms.     ‘Case   matching’   is the
preservation on the bare pronoun of the case the pronoun would show as an argument in a
full clause.       Since licensing considerations override case in weak pronouns, case
matching can only show up in strong pronouns, as in Zuni, (121).

2.3 Licensing Pronouns
          Evidence in the preceding sections has indicated that the distribution of pronounsin several languages is governed by constraints that appear to affect different members ofthe class of pronouns in different ways.              In addition, the same subclass of pronouns maybehave     differently     under   different    syntactic    conditions,    as   was    the   case   for    weakpronouns in Belfast English.          In this section I will begin by suggesting why pronounsmight require special licensing.         This turns out to be a matter of licensing pronominalfeatures, for which there appears to be a range of alternative licensing mechanisms that
share one crucial property:           functional features in a proximal domain to pronominal
                                                 71
  features.     Following Cardinaletti & Starke (1994, 1996) I will suggest that pronouns have  complex       internal structure (though        the proposal       here differs from theirs in several  important details).      It is assumed that weak pronouns and strong pronouns differ in their  internal structure, and it is this structural difference that accounts for differences in the
  effect that licensing requirements have on each type of pronominal form.","[85, 86]"

"           Section 2.1 sets out the nature of pronoun form and distribution in Zuni.   I discuss
an early analysis of the data suggested by Newman (1965) and describe why this accountis problematic.    Extensive new evidence of the syntactic distribution of Zuni pronouns ispresented to serve as the basis of the analysis to follow.    Section 2.2 begins by presenting
the proposals of Cardinaletti & Starke (1994) for a theory of pronominal deficiency and
licensing and goes on to discuss some empirical problems for this account brought up byevidence for the licensing of weak pronouns in situ in O'odham (Papago) and BelfastEnglish.    In Section 2.3 I present a proposal for a theory of the complex internal structureof pronouns and the constraints on their distribution that takes into account the role thatcase seems to play in the licensing of pronouns in O'odham and Belfast English.                   I
present independent evidence for the existence of an extra set of functional featurescontained in strong pronouns and involved in licensing.          In Section 2.4 I return to the
Zuni data to explain pronoun behavior there with this new account, and in addition                                          33
  account for the O'odham and Belfast English data that was problematic for Cardinaletti &
  Starke (1994).              Finally in Section 2.5 I suggest the account may be extended to account for Zuni multiple WH movement and what appear to be strong/weak forms of WH words. I also point out the remarkable similarities in the distribution of Zuni strong pronouns     and   English     default   accusative     case   and   subsequently      suggest    that the
 phenomenon of default accusative case in English can be reanalyzed in terms of the licensing requirements of pronouns.","[47, 48]"

     1.3.3.1    Negation
               Two elements are required to mark negation in the Zuni clause, a negative particle
 and a negative verb stem suffix, (38).                       The negative particle occurs at the head of the clause in a position to which evidential and quantifier-like particles also tend to gravitate (see below).            The negative suffix occurs after transitive subject agreement but before tense inflection. (38)          ka’        hon           waccita        ‘itok'ya-na:w-amme-'kya

pronouns and not the only licensing position.               In what follows I will therefore propose anaccount of pronoun structure and licensing that accounts for ability of V to licensingweak pronouns in situ as well as the licensing of weak pronouns                         in the specifiers offunctional projections.",[85]

           It can be shown that Zuni infinitival clauses lack the functional projections of full
clauses.    If we assume that the presence of functional projections in a clause is indicatedby the presence of affixes on the verbs that correspond to the heads of these projections,we can note that the Zuni verb contains only the stem plus the infinitival suffix -nakya                          ,
(27a), and cannot appear with plural subject agreement (27b), tense inflection (27c), oreven a negation suffix (28a-b).39
39 The impossibility of negation with the infinitive is illustrated with both the non-stative and the stative
form of the negative suffix in (28a-b). The parenthesized example in (27c) and the parenthesis (28c) refer
to the possibility that the -na part of the infinitive suffix may be related to the stative morpheme -na (which
would precede any inflection).",[64]

"52 Object shift is also discussed in relation to verb movement in Early Modern English by Roberts (1995).
53 The various positions of the subjects in (53) are due to the fact that the overt subject either remains in
situ or moves out of the VP. According to Henry, VP adverbs are preferred after the subject in these
imperatives, though they can also occur between verb and subject.

appears to the left of the verb in non-negative imperatives).(i)a.       Don't you do that.

"           First some     background.        Kashmiri      has    two   types   of pronominal          elements,
 independent pronouns and clitics.           Both sets of pronouns are marked for person, numberand case features.        Several diagnostic behaviors indicate that the independent pronounsare strong pronouns.        One such diagnostic is the behavior of the independent pronouns visa vis non-finite clauses.           Clitic pronouns       lack the F° projection         and so require       an
alternative licenser?3, usually a functional head of a finite clause.                            The   Kashmiri
accusative clitic an       in (78) therefore climbs out of the non-finite complement into themain clause.",[98]

 2.1 The Syntax of Zuni Pronouns
          A description of the Zuni pronouns appears in Newman (1965), where it is noted
 that each of the pronouns listed has two forms.            It is stated there that the distribution of
 the two forms of the Zuni pronouns is determined by phonological factors.                  I will present
a range of new evidence in this section to argue that the distribution of the allomorphs ofthe Zuni pronouns is syntactically determined.            In the final subsection (2.1.3) I present an
account of these facts that suggests that functional categories may be implicated in theconstraints on the distribution of the Zuni pronouns.",[48]

              In contrast to English, the Zuni and Tiwa verbs that occur with an expletive objectpronoun            are not of a uniform         complement       selecting   type.     Zuni   and Tiwa      objectexpletives are found both with verbs that take non-factive complements                                (‘believe’,
 “want’), as well as with those that take factive complements                    (‘know’,     ‘see’, ‘discover’ ).","[270, 271]"
"           The accusative case on arguments of Zuni unaccusatives is just as predictable as in passives.       Unaccusative verbs and derivationally related stative verbs occur in minimal pairs with respect to interpretation and case assignment.                     The unaccusative form haseventive interpretation and assigns accusative case, while the related stative form occurswith nominative case.           One such pair is illustrated below in (25).!24             Every accusative
assigning unaccusative Zuni verb has a stative counterpart of this sort.

"63 This assumption contrasts with that of Cardinaletti and Starke (1994), who assume case, agreement and
referential features are located together in a C° head. Further, for them NP not DP is the root of the
pronoun structure they propose.
64 More specifically, I assume K’ either contains case features itself, or is empty and is associated with case
features located elsewhere (Bittner & Hale 1996a). The distinction (and relevance for pronoun licensing)
will be discussed below.
65 [n the case of Zuni singular and plural nominative strong forms (cf. the examples in (1) earlier), F*
appears to be filled by a copy of the number feature of the base. The morpheme -no found in the strong
pronouns is also found in the suppletive plural imperative of the verb ‘a: ‘go’, (i) below. F° can apparently
also be filled by an dummy morpheme consisting of final gemination of weak pronoun +a                   and is found in
the accusative and possessive singular strong forms. This same gemination +a dummy ending can be
found (for different reasons) on items from other lexical classes, (ii).(i)         ‘a:              go

             Recall that it was argued above that pronominal features require licensing as other  inflectional features do, and that pronouns are licensed when they are in the minimal domain of some licensing head X°.             I suggest more specifically that pronominal-licensing head X° is a functional head, and that there are two ways in which pronominal features can be licensed by a functional head.             Either the pronoun must contain some licensing functional head (i.e. F°) as part of its structure, as in the case of the strong pronouns, or if F* is absent, as in the case of weak pronouns,                 the pronoun must move         to the minimal domain       of some    other functional head (i.e. in IP).        In other words,      the need for some alternative form of licensing for their pronominal features drives the movement of weak pronouns.","[90, 91]"
