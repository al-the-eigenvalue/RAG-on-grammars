9.12.3 Alternative questions
So-called ‘alternative questions’ (Dixon 2012:398-400) are made possible in
Ik through the use of the disjunctive conjunction keɗe ‘or’. This conjunction
joins noun phrases in a series or whole clauses into a complex sentence.
Apart from keɗe, Ik alternative questions are not marked by any overt
morphological or prosodic means. In the examples below, keɗe joins two
534
clauses that could each constitute polar questions on their own. Together
they make up a content question whose answer will be the affirmation of
one or the other. Note that the final constituent remains in its final form:
(189)   Maraŋa keɗe gaan?
        [maráŋ-á] keɗe           [ɡaan-∅]
        good-REAL or             bad-REAL
        Is it good or (is it) bad?","[565, 566]"
"
9.12.1 Polar questions
Polar questions generally expect a simple confirmation or denial as a
response. The response can be ‘yes’ (éé/ee) or ‘no’ (ńtóodó) or a repetition of
the question in the affirmative. Such questions in Ik are recognized by two
characteristics: 1) They end with the non-final allomorph of the last
morpheme in the question (as opposed to the final form in an Indicative
sentence), and 2) the last mora of the question takes a low boundary tone:
(166)   Maraŋa?                              Maraŋǃ
        maráŋ-à                           maráŋ-∅                 good-REAL                            good-REAL
        Is it good?                          It’s good.",[558]
"
In answer to this question, one typically responds with another question:
(90)    (Iyida) bia ʝii?
        (i-íd-a)      bi-a=ʝɪɪ
        be-2SG-REAL you.SG.NOM=also
        (Are you there) you also?",[497]
"
In (252), the noun ɲɛƙɛ- receives a H tone on its first syllable as a result of
high-tone insertion disrupting a sequence of more than three L tones.
                                                                                  557
9.16.4 Negative tags
Ik has two negative ‘tags’ that can be used following either positive or
negative statements. When they are used, the speaker normally expects a
corresponding positive reply. These tags and their replies are as follows:
(254)   Nta ƙamatii?                              Ƙamatadǃ
        ńt-á       ƙám-átì=ìINTERROG              ƙám-át-a=dᵉ
        not-REAL be.like-3PL[IRR]=DP              be.like-3PL-REAL=DP
        Are they (i.e. words) not like that? They are like thatǃ
(255)   ...keɗe benia nti?                        Ntia ʝaǃ
        keɗe      beni-a           ńtí            ńtí-a=ʝa
        or        not.be-REAL like.that           like.that=ADV
        ...or is it not like that?                Just like thatǃ
Finally, Ik has both positive and negative independent polarity particles:
ee/éé ‘yes’ and ńtóodó ‘no’. The particle ńtóodó seems to be morphologically
complex, though it cannot be fully parsed out. In any case, it seems to
incorporate the negator verb ńt-. In Ik, contrary to English, a negative reply
to a negative question can be preceded by ee/éé ‘yes’, and positive reply to a
negative question can be preceded by ńtóodó ‘no’. Consider the following:
(256)   Negative question:                 Nta beɗidi?
                                           ńt-á              bɛ́ɗ-ɪ ́dɪINTERROG
                                                                        ̀
                                           not-REAL          want-2SG [IRR]
                                           Don’t you want (it)?","[588, 589]"
"
In principle, any word, phrase, clause, or sentence in the language can be
questioned in a way that expects a confirmation or denial. Whatever
grammatical category the questioned element belongs to, it will be in its
non-final form together with the low boundary tone of interrogative
528
intonation. In (172) and (173), it is a simple NP that has been questioned,
whereas in (174), a simultaneous subordinate clause is under query:
(172)   Ntsa?                                 Ee, nts.
        nts-à INTERROG                        ee         nts-∅
        s/he-NOM                              yes        s/he-NOM
        She?                                  Yes, she.","[559, 560]"
"
9.11.3 Apposition
Finally, an NP can simply be apposed to a following clause in which it has
no syntactic or semantic role, though a pragmatic relationship is implied.
This type of pragmatic operation can be formulated as follows, where S
stands for the main clause (notation borrowed from Payne 1997:274):
(164)   Ik apposition:          [NP] [S]
Apposed noun phrases are also separated from the following clause by a
pause and often solicitive intonation. And the head of an apposed NP must
take the nominative case. But unlike left-dislocated arguments, apposed NPs
are not arguments in the clauses that follow them. As such, they are not
recapitulated in those clauses in any way. For example, in the next example,
the apposed NP simply expresses the reason for the proposition that follows.
It does not figure into the main clause either syntactically or semantically:
(165)   Koroɓaa atsiadee, tawanaa ɲeɗekea imak.
        [kɔ́rɔ́ɓá-a [ats-í-á=deé]SUBORD]NP[tawán-á-a       ɲɛɗɛkɛ-a   imá-kᵃ]S
        thing- NOM come-1SG-REAL=DP harm-REAL-PRF illness-NOM child-ACC
        What I came for, okay...Illness is harming (my) child.
526
9.12 Questions
Questions in Ik may be polar (yes/no) questions or content questions. Polar
questions add an interrogative overlay to a sentence otherwise in the
indicative mood. This overlay consists of a) the non-final form of the final
morpheme in the clause and b) an interrogative intonation. Content
questions, on the other hand, involve a) interrogative words that substitute
for the clausal constituent they question, and optionally b) a topicalized
structure where the interrogative word acts as a verbless clause (copula)
complement. Each type of Ik question is described in more detail below.","[557, 558]"
"
The interrogative tune is the intonational pattern used for yes/no questions.
This tune is defined by a low boundary tone that replaces any high tone on
the final syllable. As a morpho-syntactic correlate of this tune, the final
morpheme of the sentence must occur in its non-final form. This
morphological open-endedness can be viewed as iconic of the fact that a
question is pragmatically open-ended, expecting a response.",[159]
"
The true morphological marker of polar questions in Ik is the final, low
boundary-tone comprising the interrogative intonational tune. In this, Ik
differs from neighboring Teso-Turkana languages like Turkana which
append the invariable question particle -à to utterances to make a polar
question (Dimmendaal 1983:429). Heine & König posited -a as an
interrogative particle in Ik too (1996:116), but this must be based on an
incorrect analysis of the suffix {-a} which marks both nominative case and
realis modality. If either of these morphemes came clause-finally in a polar
question, it would definitely resemble the Teso-Turkana question particle.",[561]
"
When a particular clausal constituent is questioned rather than the whole
clause, it is fronted into a cleft construction. In this construction, the
focused element acts as a verbless clause complement and takes the
copulative case. The rest of the clause then shifts into a subordinate clause
structure. This syntax of this construction is the same as is used for content
questions. The following examples compare non-focused polar questions
(175 and 176) with their respective clefted equivalents (177 and 178):
(175)   Atsia naa kaudzoe?
        ats-íd-a=naa              kaúdzo-è INTERROG
        come-2SG -REAL=PST1       money-DAT
        Did you come for money?
                                                                         529
(176)   Kaudzoo naa atsidee?
        kaúdzo-o=náa         ats-íd-e=è
        money-COP=PST 1      come-2SG-REAL=DP INTERROG
        Was it money you came for?","[560, 561]"
"
9.12.2 Content questions
Content questions in Ik involve clauses in which a constituent has been
replaced with an interrogative word. Unlike in some languages, only one
interrogative word per question is permitted in Ik. Ik Interrogative words—
see (179) below—include those corresponding to (and therefore standing in
place of) (pro)nouns, adverbs, and verbs. Besides the interrogative words
themselves, no other special morphological or intonational means are used.
530
(179) Ik interrogative words
        INTERROG           Meaning                                Word class
        ndo-               ‘who?’                                 (pro)noun
        ndaí-/ńtá          ‘where?’                               (pro)noun
        ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɪ ́-       ‘which (sg.)?’                         (pro)noun
        ńtí-ɛ́nɪ ́-        ‘which (pl.)?’                         (pro)noun
        ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɪ ́-/ńt-   ‘when (+specified unit of time)?’      (pro)noun
        isi-               ‘what?’                                (pro)noun
                           ‘why (with DAT or ABL case)?’          (pro)noun
        ńtí                ‘how?’                                 adverb
        kɪtɔ́ós-          ‘what quality (color, shape, etc.)?’   verb
        taná-              ‘how many?’                            verb
As can be seen from (179), most Ik interrogative words are (pro)nouns and
thus inflect fully for case. Some others, like ńtɛ́- ɛ́nɪ́- ‘which (sg)?’ are
compound nouns. The adverbial interrogative ńtí ‘how’ is an invariable
particle, and the words kɪtɔ́ɔś - ‘what quality?’ and taná- ‘how many?’ are
both intransitive verbs.","[561, 562]"
"
Besides the interrogative low boundary tone evident in (166) and (67), one
may detect a slightly higher overall pitch level for the polar question. This
higher pitch level does not affect tone at the lexical or phrase level but
                                                                                  527
merely raises the relative pitch of the whole sentence. The degree to which
the pitch is raised seems to be tied to the level of emphasis or emotion
behind the question. For more on the intonational tunes of indicative,
interrogative, and ‘solicitive’ sentences, refer back to §3.3.5.","[558, 559]"
"
After these initial greetings used to initiate a social interaction, any of the
following questions may be posed in a polite bid for more information:
(94)    Kutana is?                          Isiemutio iy?
        kʊt-an-a          is-∅              isi-emutí-ó             i-∅
        say-IPS-REAL      what-OBL          what-story/news-COP     be-REAL
        What is said?                       What news is there?
                                                                         467
Of course, like greeting questions in any language, the ones in (94) are more
like rhetorical questions than information questions. There is handful of
standard replies that may be alternated according to the weather, the
relative hunger felt in that land, or the current mood in the neighborhood:
(95)    Biraa emuta iy.
        bɪra-a        émut-a            i-∅
        not.be-REAL story/news- NOM     be-REAL
        There is no news.
(96)    Ɲeƙe eɗa.
        ɲɛƙ-a             ɛɗá
        hunger- NOM       only
        Only hunger.","[498, 499]"
"
The confirmational construction is morphologically interrogative, in that the
final vowel is voiced in a clause-final position. For example, in the
indicative mood, one would expect the phrase in (305) ‘Yes, I did speak (to
so-and-so)’ to surface as noo tódi in Ik, with the realis {-a} devoiced or
deleted. Perhaps at a pragmatic level, the structure is functioning as a
rhetorical question whose implied response is ‘Yes, of course you spoke’.
8 Other Word ClassesIn addition to nouns and verbs—Ik’s large open word classes—the language
also has several other, closed word classes. These include quantifiers (§8.1),
demonstratives (§8.2.), adverbs (§8.3), conjunctions (§8.4), prepositions
(§8.5), interjections (§8.6), ideophones (§8.7), and infantile imperatives
(§8.8). Time expressions, while technically nouns, are discussed as a lexical
subset in §8.9. And though greetings do not make up a separate class in and
of themselves, they are used in a ritualized way that transcends whatever
word classes they consist of. For that reason, they are discussed in §8.10.","[458, 459]"
"
After one’s origin or destination has been revealed, further seemingly (to
outsiders) intrusive questions may be asked. These questions are generally
good-natured and should be viewed as such. Consider the following:
(102)   Isio naa nƙaneid?
        isi-o=náa              ŋƙan-é-íd-∅
        what-COP=PST 1         get-VEN-2SG-REAL
        What did you get (i.e. when you went there)?",[501]
"
The most general greeting and the one usually first taught to outsiders is in
the form of a question:
(89)    Iyida?                           Iyita?
        i-íd-a                           i-ít-a
        be-2SG-REAL                      be-2PL-REAL
        Are you there?                   Are you all there?",[497]
"
With this grammar I have also tried to initiate a philological tradition for
Ik—‘philological’ in the etymological sense of ‘love of learning’, yes, but also
in the sense of language study from written sources. From now on, one can
study Ik from books alone, perhaps furthering the inquiry into the
relationships between East African languages and where they came from.
Attending to these questions is attending to the people who speak these
languages, and this is one way we can communicate our love for them too.
 “Man [and the language he speaks: TBS] is a mystery. It needs to be unraveled,
and if you spend your whole life unraveling it, don’t say you’ve wasted time. I am
           studying that mystery because I want to be a human being.”
                              F. Dostoevsky 1839.","[19, 20]"
"
9.12.4 Tags
Ever given to rhetorical flourishes, Ik speakers may use one of several
interrogative ‘tags’ to solicit a response from those listening to their speech.
Each of the tags is a negated polar question to which the expected response
is in the affirmative. The following two are representative:
(191)   Benia ntia?                                  Nti.
        beni-a          ńtíâINTERROG                 ńtí
        not.be-REAL like.that                        like.that
        Is it not so?                                (It is) so.",[566]
"
A variety of ‘narrative’ or ‘subsecutive’ verb forms are found scattered
throughout the East African region, for example: Lango and Nuer (Western
Nilotic); Toposa, Turkana, Maasai (Eastern Nilotic), and So (Kuliak). As a
result of the long-term contact between Ik and Teso-Turkana languages, one
wonders whether the Ik sequential aspect is a grammatical replication of the
Teso-Turkana ‘subsecutive’ mood. The two have similar functions, but the
morphological resources used for them are quite different. In pursuit of this
question, the following comparison may provide some clues. Data on Teso-
Turkana are taken from Dimmendaal’s description of Turkana (1983):
(149)   Comparison of Ik ‘sequential’ with Teso-Turkana ‘subsecutive’
                                                Ik            Turkana
        After a temporal controlling verb?      Yes           Yes
        Has special agreement markers?          Partly        No
        After an auxiliary verb?                Optional      Obligatory
        Can cooccur with tense marking?         Optional      No
        As hortative & jussive?                 Optional      Obligatory
        In double imperatives?                  Optional      Obligatory
        In simultaneous clauses                 Optional      Obligatory
        After a quotative complementizer?       No            Yes
        Has different aspect marking?           No            Partly
        Indentical to imperative?               No            Yes
                                                                                       367
7.8.2 Simultaneous
The suffix {-kɛ} marks the ‘simultaneous’ aspect in Ik. As discussed back in
§6.4.1, the accepted analysis is that this suffix is a grammaticalization of the
homophonous dative case suffix. Or otherwise, both suffixes arose from a
common proto-morpheme. The reader is referred to §6.4.1 for more details.
The simultaneous suffix attaches directly to the underlying forms of the
subject-agreement markers. This combination resulted in the high-frequency
sequence /-ɪkᵋ/ or /-ikᵉ/ that has often been interpreted as an optative -i
together with the dative case suffix {-kɛ} (e.g. Heine & König 1996:77). In
this grammar, however, the ambiguous sequence /-ɪkᵋ/ or /-ikᵉ/ is treated as
a combination of the 3SG morpheme {-ɪ-} and the simultaneous {-kɛ}.","[398, 399]"
"
Some further examples of Ik polar questions include these below. For each
clause-final element, its final form is shown in square brackets to indicate
how it would look if the clause were indicative instead of interrogative:
(168)   Maa noo tsitsiiƙoti ʝotea?
        má-á=noo           tsits-í-íƙot-i             ʝɔtɛ́-âINTERROG    [ʝɔtɛ́-kᵃ]
        not-REAL=PST 3 roll-PLUR-AND -3SG             sisal.root-ACC
        Did he not used to roll sisal roots?",[559]
"
When the question ‘Where?’ is asked in isolation, the interrogative pronoun
ńt- is used instead of ndaí-, in its nominative case form as ńt-á. For example,
if someone yells ntsúó kɪɗá ‘There it isǃ’, a questioning reply would be ńtá
‘Where?’ rather than ndaíkᵉ ‘where:DAT?’.",[248]
"
In the first example below, the verb is marked grammatically only with the
sequential impersonal passive suffix. But semantically, it implies that when
the thing in question becomes a certain way, it is for a certain purpose.",[542]
"
(257)   Possible answers:
        Ee, nta beɗi.                      Ntoodo, beɗi.

        Yes, I don’t want (it).            No, I want (it).
10       Sentences and BeyondUp to this point, the discussion of syntax has been concerned with the
formation of individual noun phrases and clauses, main and subordinate. It
has also covered the formation of complex sentences that combine a matrix
clause with a subordinate clause. The present chapter moves beyond clause-
level syntax to examine the joining of two or more main clauses (§10.1) and
Ik’s primary clause-linking strategy—clause chaining (§10.2).","[589, 590, 591]"

Finally, after six months away from the Ik area, we returned to Ikland to
intermittently fill in gaps in the data, revise hypotheses, and finish writing
during the whole year of 2013. From the end of 2013 through the early part
of 2014, Lomeri John Mark—at last returned to Ikland—provided crucial
last-minute help in answering grammatical questions, checking examples,
and filling in paradigms. In March-April of 2014, a group of ten Ik men
participated with me in an orthography workshop. More data and insights
came from our enjoyable interaction. Research then concluded in July 2014.

1.3.3 Data
The data used in this description of Ik comprises approximately 6,000 words
(mostly nouns and verbs) in a FLEx lexical database and over 100 texts of
different genres and varying numbers of pages. Additional data was
collected throughout the fieldwork period through direct elicitation,
uncountable scribbled notes, and lots of careful listening. When data is
quoted from previous works, the source is indicated with the example.
Otherwise, data comes from my research, usually through Longoli Philip
and Lomeri John Mark or through daily interactions with Ik neighbors.","[62, 63]"

and the simultaneous aspect on the other. For the sake of illustration,
morpheme-breaks are purposely not inserted between the subject-agreement
markers and the realis suffix {-a/-ᵃ} or the simultaneous suffix {-ɛ/-kᵋ}:

If the simultaneous (‘subjunctive’) aspecutal suffix is -ɛ/kɛ/kᵋ as claimed in
König 2002, where do the subject-agreement markers end in the last two
columns of (184)? In answer to this question, it is concluded here that a)
since the dative case preserves the stem-final vowel in the nominal system,
and b) if the simultaneous suffix is a grammaticalization of the dative case,
then c) it too, by analogy, might preserve the final vowel of the morpheme
to which it attaches. In this case, that morpheme is the subject-agreement
suffixes. So, when the simultaneous suffix in the final column of (184) is
removed, what is left is the subject-agreement suffixes without an
intervening optative marker. The realis forms can then be accounted for by
the realis suffix {-a}, itself a (potential) grammaticalization of the
nominative {-a} that subtracts the subject-agreement suffixes’ final vowel.","[328, 329]"

The final form of ‘at home’ is awákᵉ, as seen above in (81), while the usual
non-final form is awéé. However, in questions with the interrogative tune,
the low boundary tone replaces the high tone on the dative case suffix {-ɛ}.","[159, 160]"

1.2.5 Previous works
It goes without saying that this grammar of Ik builds on the good linguistic
work of many others. The first of these others, Wayland (1931), compiled a
short list of Ik words on a geological survey through the area. In his article,
he refers to the Ik as the ‘Wanderobo’, a common term for non-pastoralist
peoples bordering the lands of Eastern Nilotes. Because his word list
includes several items not immediately recognizable as Ik, it fostered a
belief that persisted for years that ‘Dorobo’ might be a fourth, now extinct
Kuliak language. Careful scrutiny, however, reveals that Wayland’s ‘Dorobo’
wordlist is most likely Ik, poorly transcribed and poorly glossed (Schrock, to
appear; also Serzisko 1992:7)). The implication is that there never was a
fourth Kuliak language called ‘Dorobo’, though credit is still due Wayland
for recording the first information on the language.
                                                                            27
As the years progressed, other linguists undertook to describe Ik. This led to
several early grammar sketches, each with different emphases, including
Crazzolara 1967, Heine 1971, Tucker 1971-73, and Heine 1975. Once Ik
became known to the linguistic world, the question of Kuliak internal and
external classification arose. This question was first addressed by Greenberg
1963, then Heine 1976, and in the same year Bender 1976, followed later
by contributions from Ehret 1981, Fleming 1983, and Lamberti 1988.","[58, 59]"
"
The question remains, however, whether the subordinate clause in (153) is a
relative clause. In the Kuliak language So, clefted interrogative words are
said to be modified by relative clauses (Carlin 1993:135). But for Ik, a
relative clause interpretation for sentences like the one in (153) is ruled out
on the basis that any tense markers immediately follow the clefted
argument, as in (154). Relative clauses, by contrast, are tensed by the
relative pronouns themselves, as in (155):
(154)   Mesoo bee beɗim.
        mɛsɔ́-ɔ́CC=bɛɛ   [bɛ́ɗ-ɪ ́m-∅]CS
        beer-COP=PST 2 want-1PL.EXC-REAL
        It was beer (that) we wanted (yesterday).",[554]
"
Using Speech Analyzer software, the following four nouns were compared in
terms of the duration of their vowel targets. The approximate measurements
from a single Ik speaker indicate that the duration of a diphthong-like sound
is longer than for single vowels but shorter than for double vowels:
(14)    Vowel length measurements
        V      akᵃ             ‘mouth’         (~0:0.1600)
        V      ekwᵃ            ‘eye’           (~0:0.1700)
        V̯ V   e̯akwᵃ          ‘man’           (~0:0.1900)
        VV     seekwᵃ          ‘broth’         (~0:0.2050)
The question of diphthongs versus glide+vowel combinations is taken up
again below in §2.2.3, where a list of representative words is presented.",[76]
"
In closing, the question must be asked: Is the Ik ‘copulative’ really a case?
As mentioned above, Cushitic parallels for the Ik copulative case suffix {-kɔ}
are analyzed variously as suffixes, clitics and ‘markers’ more generally. In
strictly morphological terms, the morpheme {-kɔ} certainly patterns like all
the other Ik case suffixes: 1) It has an identical segmental shape as that of
the dative and accusative cases, 2) it undergoes identical morpho-
phonological alternations as the others suffixes, and 3) it fills the same
nominal suffixal position as the other case suffixes. Then in syntactic terms,
it patterns with other cases in that it is required to mark a unique argument
(complement) in a specific clause type: a negative copula of identity clause.
Thus it is analyzed in this grammar as a ‘case’ proper, synchronically.",[320]
"
Another question relevant to the Ik accusative case is what semantic roles
the object of a transitive clause can take. This question applies to transitive
objects generally, including those marked in the nominative case. Ik direct
objects encode the expected semantic role of Patient, but they can also
encode Direction and/or Purpose. Three Ik verbs of motion—ats- ‘come’, ƙa-
‘go’, and ɪtá- ‘reach’—are unusual in that they can behave like transitive
verbs. Similar motion-verb properties have been reported as common in
Cushitic and Omotic languages (Dimmendaal 2003:100). Old Nubian is
reported to have marked Patients and Directions with the suffix -ka, while
the Semitic language Tigrinya uses its accusative prefix ni-/nä- to mark
Patients, Directions, and many other roles (Dimmendaal 2010:41).
276
The following sentences are examples of a) Ik motion verbs functioning as
transitive verbs and b) object case (NOM or ACC) marking Direction/Purpose:
(130)   Atsaa ƙanesia kuruɓadie ntsi.
        ats-á-á          ƙan-ésí-aO     kúrúɓádi-e ntsí-∅
        come- REAL-PRF get-INF-ACC things-GEN he-GEN
        He has come to get his things.

        go-REAL=PST 1 buy-ACC           food-GEN
        He went to buy food.","[307, 308]"
"
In the neighboring languages of Toposa (Schröder & Schröder 1987) and
Turkana (Dimmendaal 1983), non-voiced vowels have been analyzed as
distinct phonemes, contrasting with voiced vowels. Dimmendaal writes that
“With regard to the position of non-voiced vowels, it is noted that they only
occur in word-final position (i.e. potentially in the position before pause),
but so may voiced vowels. It is, therefore, not predictable synchronically in
Turkana when a vowel is [+voiced], or [-voiced]” (1983:31). But in Ik, it is
generally predictable: Any vowel before a pause is devoiced, and any vowel not
before a pause is voiced. For Turkana it is claimed that underlying non-voiced
[-voiced] vowels become voiced “in the position other than before pause”,
as the following examples illustrate (Dimmendaal 1983:31):
(15)    lo-muɡi ̥ || → [lomuɡ̥ʰi ̥]       ‘the mauve-colored one’
        lo-muɡi ̥ lo → [lomuɡi lo]        ‘this mauve-colored one’
The opposite interpretation is given for Ik: Underlyingly voiced vowels become
devoiced before a pause. Such a view helps explain apparent evidence for
phonemic voicing contrast in examples like the following:
(16)    ín-o     ||   → ínᵒ [i ́no̥]      ‘with (an) animal(s)’
        ínó-o    ||   → ínó [ínó]         ‘from (an) animal(s)’
In (16), the noun root ínó- ‘animal(s)’ takes two case suffixes. In the first
line, the instrumental case suffix {-o}, which first subtracts the root-final
vowel /o/, is devoiced before a pause. In the second line, the ablative case
suffix, also {-o}, which preserves the root-final vowel, gets devoiced and
46
actually deleted, leaving the root final vowel fully voiced. So what first
appears to be a case of contrastiveness between voiced and non-voiced
vowels is really a syntactically conditioned type of allophony. The
devoiced/deleted vowels in (16), when in a clause-medial position, surface
as fully voiced in line with their underlying voicing specification:
(17)    ín-ó=ni      →       ínó=ni       [ínónì]      ‘with these animals’
        ínó-o=ni     →       ínóo=ni      [ínóônì]     ‘from these animals’
The examples above in (16) illustrate another trait of Ik devoiced vowels:
Depending on the vowel preceding them, they may be completely inaudible.
As such, a further allophone of all nine vowels is simply zero [∅]. A
devoiced vowel is inaudible when it is identical or very close in quality to
the vowel that immediately precedes it, for example in:
(18)    baro-o       →       baroᵒ        [bàrò]       ‘from the corral’
        dakú-o       →       dakúᵒ        [dākú]       ‘from the tree’
        ɲɛƙɛ-ɛ       →       ɲɛƙɛᵋ        [ɲɛ̀ƙɛ̀]     ‘of hunger’
        sɪsɪ ́-ɛ     →       sɪsɪ ́ᵋ      [sɪ ̄sɪ ́]   ‘in the honey-beer’
As noted above, pre-pause vowel devoicing is a general rule. The rule is
supsended in the following four environments: 1) when the phrase or clause
has interrogative intonation, 2) when the phrase or clause has solicitive
intonation, 3) when the anaphoric demonstratives =ꜜdɛ́ɛ ́ (sg.) or =ꜜdíí (pl.)
are present, and 4) when the vowel in question is part of a deictic
demonstrative. In environments (1)-(2), the syntax and therefore the
phonology iconically reflect the pragmatic notion that the clause lacks the
level of finality needed for devoicing. For a question, this entails waiting for
an answer. For solicitation, this entails waiting for the desired response:
                                                                          47
(19)    Ƙaa naa awak.                        INDICATIVE        ƙa-a=náa         awá-kᵉ

        S/he went home.

        go-3SG=PST 1     home-DAT
        Did s/he go home?
(21)    Ƙaa naa aweee?                       SOLICITIVE        ƙa-a=náa         awé-eé
        go-3SG=PST 1     home-DAT
        S/he went home, okay?","[77, 78, 79]"
"
If the noun in question is the subject, its number is marked with subject-
agreement suffixes (3SG being null), but this type of marking is defective.
For example, in unmarked main clauses, where the verb comes before the
subject, both 3SG and 3PL overt subjects are marked as 3SG (null) on the
verb. This is true whether grammatical number is encoded generally (39) or
with a plurative suffix (40):
(39)    Bwaanuƙotaa inw.
        buan-uƙot-á-á                     ínw-ᵃ
        disappear- COMP[3SG]-REAL-PRF     animal(s)-NOM
        a) The animal has disappeared.
        b) The animals have disappeared.

        buan-uƙot-á-á                      ɛ́b-ɪtɪ ́n-∅
        disappear- COMP[3SG]-REAL-PRF      gun-PL-NOM
        The guns have disappeared.","[185, 186]"
"
If these differing classifications are any indication, the Kuliak languages
truly are “an enigma in African linguistics” (Carlin 1993:4)
16
The purpose of this grammar is not to advance another classificatory
hypothesis for Kuliak. But nonetheless, it is hoped that the insights gained
from this study will get the problem closer to its resolution. For a variety of
reasons, there seems to be a bias in the literature toward a Nilo-Saharan
classification for Ik (and Kuliak). The question really has to do with what it
means for a language to be related to another. If, as has been pointed out in
Ehret (1981a) and Fleming (1983), a larger percentage of Ik phonological,
morphological, and lexical traits can be linked to Nilo-Saharan than to
Afroasiatic, is that sufficient evidence for positing a genetic relationship
with Nilo-Saharan? Is the ample counter-evidence linking Ik to Cushitic (e.g.
Lamberti 1988) or Omotic not convincing because of lower percentages?","[47, 48]"

                                 To my parents, Arlin & Velma:
 Dad, for imparting his way with words and his search for truth,
Mom, for showing how to learn the world with love and wonder.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

Thanks go to Tim Stirtz for introducing me to the external degree offered at
Leiden University and to Constance Kutsch-Lojenga for frequent guidance
through the early stages of the program, particularly in phonological study.
I am grateful to my Promotor Maarten Mous for his patient mentoring and
timely replies to my unending questions. Gerrit Dimmendaal is kindly
thanked for his camaraderie and insightful responses on many linguistic
issues. I appreciate the valuable contribution Ron Moe made in gathering Ik
lexical data, and I thank the following people for their help in tone and
[ATR] analysis: Keith Snider, Rod Casali, Colleen Ahland, Michael Ahland.",[15]

1.2.1 Classification
Greenberg (1963) is the purportedly the source of the original ‘Kuliak
Hypothesis’ which placed Ik and Nyang’ía into a linguistic cluster based on
observed shared traits (Fleming 1983:426). Heine (1976) elaborated on this
hypothesis with a comparative grammar sketch and internal reconstruction
of the group he called Kuliak consisting of Ik, Nyang’ía, and So/Tepeth.
Since then, the internal linguistic relationship between the Kuliak languages
has never been seriously questioned in the literature (Fleming 1983:426).
But, amazingly, no less than six different external classifications for Kuliak
have been proposed over the last fifty years. These conflicting classifications
and some of the linguists who have supported them are presented below:
                                                                            15
(9)     Conflicting classifications of Kuliak         Afroasiatic, ‘Fringe’ Cushitic—Tucker 1967a, 1967b, 1971‒3.
           This classification was based on, among other things, supposed
           similarities between Ik and Ancient Egyptian personal pronouns.
           Ik’s elaborate case system also suggests an Afroasiatic affiliation,
           but this could just as likely be from sustained language contact.","[46, 47]"

SamenvattingDit boek omvat een analyse van het Ik (Icé-tód), een Kuliak (Rub)-taal
gesproken door 7500 mensen in noordoost Oeganda. Het levert een zo
volledig mogelijke basisinventaris van de klank/vorm/betekeniseenheden
die samen de grammatica van het Ik vormen. Het boek kan voortborduren
op een solide traditie van vijftig jaar taalbeschrijving. Desalniettemin vult
het een aantal belangrijke gaten op. De noodzaak voor een vollediger
beschrijving is nijpend gezien het feit dat de twee andere leden van de
subgroep, Nyang’ia en So/Tepeth, op het punt van uitsterven staan. Een
tweede doel van deze studie is dan ook een precieze en adequate geschreven
weergave te bieden van het Ik voor het geval, door de krachtige neiging tot
assimilatie aan het Engels en de Teso-Turkana talen uit de Oost-Nilotische
(Nilo-Saharaanse) taalfamilie, ook Ik verloren gaat. Een derde doel van deze
studie is een duidelijker beeld mogelijk te maken hoe Ik gerelateerd is aan
de andere talen in de regio, met name door parallellen voor te stellen voor
de grammaticale morfemen van het Ik.","[731, 732, 733, 734, 735, 736, 737, 738, 739, 740, 741]"

But this analysis is flawed due to incorrect morphological parsing. The verb
form in question is not bɪra-e analyzed as bɪra-DAT but rather bɪrá-ɪ́-ɛ
analyzed as bɪrá-3SG-SIML. This form is not a noun or verb fossilized into a
preposition but rather an instance of the impersonal, 3SG adverbial
simultaneous verbs used in clause chains (§11.2.2). It is true that this verb
form is often best translated as ‘without’ into English, but it does not follow
that it has become a ‘preposition’. The example sentence in (160), taken
from König (2002:255) is reanalyzed and glossed here as follows:
(161)   Ƙoyaa Kakumee eɗa, birayee iŋaaresik.
        ƙó-ia-a      kákumé-é         ɛɗá      bɪrá-ɪ ́-ɛ       ɪŋaar-ɛ́sɪ ́-kᵃ
        go-1SG-SEQ Kakuma-DAT         alone    lack-3SG-SIML    help-INF -ACC
        I went to Kakuma alone without (lit. ‘it lacking’) any help.
                                                                            285
6.3.8 Copulative
The Ik copulative case suffix has the form {-kɔ}. In terms of parallels, the
wider Cushitic language family abounds with possibilities. Sidaamo has
-ho/hu as a copulative suffix (Lamberti 1984:5), and Arbore has an
interrogative       copula   with the form -ko (Hayward 1984:122).            An
interrogative copula with the form -ko is also found in the Southern Cushitic
languages Alagwa and Burunge (Mous 2012:398). Suggesting a link with the
Ik copulative’s focalizing function, Eastern Cushitic’s Dhaasanac has an
enclitic =u called a ‘nominal focus marker’ (Tosco 2001:60, 268-269).","[316, 317]"

The answer to both of these greetings, as well as the one presented next in
(93), is the refrain given in (90) above.",[498]

The fourth function of the oblique case is to mark the first element (N1) of a
nominal compound. The first nominal element must be in the oblique case,
while the second element takes whatever case the syntactic context calls for.
In this grammar, compounds are identified with a hyphen between the two
nouns or pronouns in question. (42) gives two examples of compounds in
isolation, and (43)-(44) give two in complete sentences:

"
Chronic hunger, especially in the second and third quarters of the year, has
been part of the Ik people’s normal existence. Over time, the conditions of
hunger have shaped the culture, and this is reflected in another series of
greetings. The following greetings, having to do with hunger and food, are
often quite startling to newcomers in the area. This is because they sound
very direct and are interpreted literally as requests for food, when more
often the people saying them do not actually expect food to be given:
(98)    Isio nƙan?                      Isio nƙi?
        isi-o         ŋƙ-an-∅           isi-o        ŋƙ-í-∅

        What is (being) eaten?          What do I eat (here)?

The standard reply to both of these questions is bɪra ‘Nothing’. But if
persistent, one may further inquire:

9.3     Basic clause structure
The ‘clause’ is defined here as the minimal unit of syntactic organization
that includes a verbal element, finite or non-finite. Thus it encompasses the
‘verb phrase’ (predicate and any modifiers) and any ‘noun phrases’ (nouns
and any modifiers) needed to fill the predicate’s argument slots. The notion
of ‘verb phrase’ per se will not be dealt with further since the ‘clause’
includes the verb phrase by definition. Having discussed noun phrases in the
last section, this one takes up the topic of basic Ik clauses: unmarked main
clauses, subordinate clauses, and various types of marked main clauses.
Other specific topics covered in later sections of this chapter include
questions, reported speech, comparative constructions, and negation.","[510, 511]"

Unlike the grammaticalization links for case>verbal affix discussed above, a
semantic link can easily be envisioned between the present perfect aspect-
tense marker {-ˊka} as a verbal suffix and the recent past marker {-ˊka} as a
suffix on demonstratives, relative pronouns, and tense enclitics. In the same
way, a semantic link can also be established between the sequential aspect
marker {-kɔ} as verbal sufix and the remote past marker {-kɔ} as a suffix on
demonstratives, relative pronouns, and tense enclitics. This is true for the
singular demonstrative forms; it is less clear how the plural ones developed:
(189)   Verbal < > demonstratival grammaticalization
                            Singular      Plural?
        Present Perfect       ats-á-kᵃ                come- REAL-PRF
        Recent Past              ná-kᵃ        ní-kⁱ   PST-REC        Sequential           ƙɔ́ɗ-ʊ́-kᵓ               cry-3SG-SEQ
        Remote Past              nɔ-kᵓ       nu-kᵘ    PST-REMSo based on phonological, morphological, and semantic properties, the
diachronic relationship between the forms in (189) is established. The
question one step removed—whether the present perfect {-ˊka} related to
the accusative case {-ka} and whether the sequential {-kɔ} is related to the
copulative {-kɔ}—is touched on above in §6.4.1 and in Schrock 2013. The
latter source fails to take into account the floating H tone in the present
perfect suffix {-ˊka} which makes a link with the accusative less plausible.
7 VerbsThe Ik language’s second large, open word class besides nouns is verbs. This
chapter begins with an overview of verb roots (§7.1) and then moves on to
describe various verbal suffixes and verb-building mechanism (§7.2-§7.11).","[332, 333]"
"
After greetings, questions, and conversation, leave-taking occurs. When one
participant gets ready to leave, the other may offer such phrases as:
470
(104)   Ƙae ʝaa?                                Ƙoyuo kotoo?

        go-IMP.SG=ADV                           go-IMP.PL=ADV
        Alright, goǃ                            You go thenǃ

        sleep-COMP-IMP.PL        good-2PL-SIML
        Sleep wellǃ
At any point of a social interaction, the liberal usage of maráŋ ‘good/okay’ is
typically appropriate. And if one is particularly happy about what has
transpired during the interaction, it is suitable to add the following:
(107)   Ilakasuƙotiaakǃ
        ɪlák-ás-ʊƙɔt-ɪ ́-a-kᵃ
        happy- ABST-COMP-1SG -REAL-PRF
        Thank you (lit. ‘I have become happy’)ǃ

        happy- ABST-COMP-1PL.EXC-REAL-PRF
        Thank you (lit. ‘We have become happy’)ǃ
9 Phrases and ClausesNow that phonemes and morphemes (words and affixes) have been
described, the present chapter takes up the topic of basic syntax. It begins
with a discussion of noun phrases (§9.1), followed by simple main clauses
(§9.3-§9.6), a variety of subordinate clauses (§9.7-§9.9), and several other
noteworthy syntactic constructions (§9.10-§9.16). In many regards, this
chapter only scratches the surface of Ik syntax, but it is hoped that the
topics covered here will provide impetus for further investigation.","[501, 502, 503]"

"
In both of these examples, there is a lowering of pitch register after an overt
H tone. From a phonetic perspective, this could be understood as an
instance of the cross-linguistic tendency of a falling contour to utilize the
full available pitch range (Yip 2002:49): The transition from H to L goes a
little lower than previous Ls, so low that following Hs do not fully recover.
But from a phonological perspective, whence the L causing downstep?
Possible answers seem to be that a) there is a L boundary tone between the
subject NP and further arguments or b) that the tonal melody of nouns like
ŋókí- ‘dog’ and ɔ́ʝá- is actually HHL rather than simply HH. With no TBU to
dock to, the L in HHL floats and causes downstep on the following TBUs.",[151]

"
The usual citation form of an Ik verb—heard in response to the question
“How do you say________in Ik?”— is the infinitive which is recognizable from
the intransitive nominalizer {-ɔnɪ-} or the transitive nominalizer {-ɛ́sɪ ́-}:
(1)     Verbal citation (isolation) forms
        Intransitive                            Transitive
        ɛf-ɔn             ‘to be sweet ‘        ɛf-ɪt-ɛsˊ              ‘to sweeten’
        zíz-on            ‘to be fat            zíz-it-és              ‘to fatten’
Just as noun roots cannot occur without a case suffix, bare verb roots also
cannot occur. Even those that may sound like a bare root to a non-Ik
speaker—the 3SG realis and singular imperative—have a minimum of one
suffix that may be devoiced or deleted at the surface level. In the realis
modality, 3SG is zero-marked (-∅) because the realis suffix {-a} subtracts
the 3SG subject-agreement suffix {-ɪ}. Then before a pause, the realis suffix
may be completely inaudible, though still present phonologically. Similarly,
the singular imperative {-ɛˊ} may be rendered inaudible before a pause:

7.1     Verbal roots
Ik verbal words consist of roots and suffixes. The present section examines
the structure of Ik roots, while §7.2-§7.9 handle the topics of verbal suffixes.
Whenever it is convenient to refer only to a root without suffixes, the root
will be hyphenated, as in ats- ‘come’ or zɪ́k- ‘tie’. Such forms are considered
lexical and slightly abstracted from actual speech. This section begins with a
few comments on various features of verbal roots in general.","[334, 335]"

The imperative bɪ́rɛ́ should not be translated simply as ‘Give me’ because
there is already another verb that means ‘give’: ma-, or me-et- in the
venitive. ‘Give me’ is the correct translation for the phrase meete ɲ́cikᵉ,
where ɲ́ cikᵉ ‘to me’ is the dative case form of the first person singular
pronoun. So ‘Give me tobacco’ would be Meete lɔ́tɔ́ɓa ɲcikᵉ. As discussed
back in §6.3.3, in the phrase brinji lotop—more accurately written as bɪ́rɛ́ ɲ́ ci
lɔ́tɔ́ɓᵓ—the object of the imperative is ɲ́ ci ‘me’ in the oblique case, while lɔ́tɔ́ɓ
‘tobacco’ is an adjunct argument in the instrumental case. If the grammar is
any indication, then the phrase means ‘X me with tobacco’. As best as can be
gathered from its singular use in this greeting of request, the verb bɪ́rɛ́ ɲ́ cⁱ
approximates to something like ‘Help me’, ‘Relieve me’, or ‘Avail me’.

Another component of Ik greeting is asking about one’s movements to and
fro. In Western society, this may seem rude as most people live out their
individual lives with a good deal of privacy. But in tight-knit communities
like those of the Ik, ones that have suffered from attacks and emergencies of
all kinds, knowing each other’s whereabouts is an expected nicety. The
following questions and replies are respresentative of what one might hear:
(100)   Atsida ndee?                      Atsia awao.
        ats-íd-a          ndɛɛ́           ats-í-á         awá-ᵒ

Although the simultaenous aspect is in principle found only in subordinate
clauses, simultaneous clauses can also be used as pragmatically independent
in everyday conversation. This usage is grammatical only if the matrix
clause for the stand-alone subordinate clause is implied by the discourse
context. And this is true whether the matrix clause was actually spoken or is
just part of the cognitive environment shared by the speech-act participants.
This use of the simultaneous is often heard in friendly bantering in response
to comments or questions, for example:
(154)   Biraa cemerik.                           Iyatieǃ
        bɪra-a      cɛmɛ́r-ɪ ́k-ᵃ    →           i-áti-e

(155)   Maa ƙoti?                                Sarimieǃ
        má-á        ƙó-ti            →           sár-ími-e

        Haven’t you gone (yet)?                  We still haven’tǃ
In both (154) and (155), the two independent clauses on the lefthand side
can be seen as the matrix clauses for the two simultaneous clauses on the
right, even though the speakers are different.","[400, 401]"
