7.2.16 Interrogative (Nuuchahnulth)The Interrogative mood in Nuuchahnulth is used in forming both content questions and yes/noquestions. In content questions it attaches to an interrogative functioning as predicate head.

7.2.15 Content and Polar Interrogatives (Makah)Makah has a mood for forming content questions and another for polar (‘yes/no’) questions.104The Content Interrogative attaches to an interrogative word like F`C`p ‘who’ or v@r` ‘where’,which functions as predicate head. The word may be underived, consisting of an interrogativeroot alone (all the interrogative roots are free roots) (416), or derived, consisting of the interroga-tive root plus lexical suffixes (417).(416) a.

"    Southern Wakashan mood clitics express a varied set of modal, evidential, and speech-actcategories. Most of these are in paradigmatic opposition, but a few may co-occur to form moodcombinations (§7.2.3). Mood clitics include the Indicative illustrated above for both languages,the Purposive M, N <""`9 ‘in order that’, interrogative moods used to form both yes/no and con-tent questions, the Conditional M <pdx(t), N <pt9 ‘if, when; would’, the Nuuchahnulth Dubi-tative <p@E` ‘perhaps’, and the Subordinate M <W, <p`9, N <p@, which forms that-clausecomplements of predicates of saying, thinking, etc. as well as causal (‘because’) clauses, and, inMakah, ‘when’ clauses (in conjunction with Ftxt ‘when’). There are also several evidentialmoods in both languages, including the Quotative M <v`9s, <v`9c`, N <vDFhm and inferen-tial moods. The Makah Relative <(p)hj, <(p)h and Nuuchahnulth Definite Relative <FHsp andIndefinite Relative <(x)h9 moods form relative clauses. See Chapter 7 for more on the form andfunction of these and other mood clitics.",[118]
"
7.4.3   Responsive (Makah)<Rh9 (RESP): This clitic indicates that the utterance is made in response to an utterance of thehearer, generally a question, as demonstrated by the following standard greeting formula:(481) Speaker 1: FtWTF`Q@j

        ‘I who am a Kyuquot look on admiringly.’ (NT 174.13)    The Indefinite Relative frequently occurs with the dubitative formative <(v)t9r to formvarious types of irrealis relative clauses. The vowel of the Indefinite appears short instead of longin this construction, which undoubtedly indicates some degree of grammaticalization in the com-bination of these formatives, though I do not find it necessary to consider it an entirely separatemood as Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 242) do.a) The dubitative Indefinite Relative is used in indirect questions after predicates expressing    lack of knowledge or understanding:(413) a. g`x@F`J`s                 pihXHG`vTrh

"    It is probably the case that the article is sensitive to discourse-pragmatic factors like topicalityand communicative importance in addition to –– or instead of –– definiteness or particular-ity/specificity strictly defined. Other criteria, as yet undiscovered, may also be relevant. As Rose(1981) suggests, it may be necessary to take into account other elements that are present in an RP,and if so, their categories. Further study of how the article is used in discourse is the only sureway of making progress on these questions.",[315]

4.5.2     Root RPsSimple RPs are the most common way of referring to entities. Another option, however, is to usea “root” RP, i.e. an RP containing a relative root. These RPs are also headless relative clauses,and are structurally similar to questions (§7.2.15-7.2.16). In this construction, a relative pronounroot such as M x`p@, N x`pi ‘one who, that which’ or M pih, N pihp ‘whoever, whatever’ ispredicate head with a relative mood clitic and appropriate pronominal clitic attached. Other predi-cative clitics (e.g. passive-inverse, temporal specifier, tense) appear according to their normalgrammatical behavior. Predicates in the phrase other than the initial relative nominal predicate arebare absolutes.",[158]

"    The spirit, if not the letter, of the present analysis of RP structure is anticipated by Sapir(1911a, 1924). The parallelism is somewhat obscured by the fact that, like other writers of thetime (cf. Andrade 1933 on Quileute, and Boas 1947 on Kwakwala), Sapir uses the terms “nomi-nal” and “verbal” in reference to kinds of linguistic categories that are today considered distinct;he uses these terms to refer to both lexeme categories (noun and verb) and logico-syntactic cate-gories (referring expression or noun phrase and predicate). (We leave open here the question ofwhether Sapir himself recognized such distinctions conceptually.) Making allowance for suchterminological conflation, we see the germ of the RPs-as-clauses analysis already in this earlystatement (Sapir 1911a: 17): “In both [Nuuchahnulth and Kwakwala] the stem is, as far as itsmeaning allows, indifferently verbal [i.e. able to function as predicate––MD] or nominal [i.e. ableto function as a referring expression] and one or more suffixes [clitics] are required to give rise todefinitely verbal [predicative] or nominal [referring] complexes; in [Nuuchahnulth] a suffixed[<FH] is often used to substantivize [i.e. make referring] a verb [i.e. predicative] form.” Like-wise, in Sapir (1924: 84, note 9), he says the article is “often used as [a] nominalizing element”.",[157]

7.2.9   Inferential I (Nuuchahnulth)The Inferential I mood is to be compared to the other two Nuuchahnulth non-quotative evidentialmoods below, the Inferential II (§7.2.17) and the Dubitative (§7.2.18). The first Inferential doesnot question the actuality of the event itself as strongly as the Dubitative, but often denotes thatsome aspect of it (cause, duration, etc.) has been inferred by the speaker rather than being defi-nitely known. In (388)a, for example, it is not the sleeping that is in doubt, but its duration. In(388)b, it simply indicates that the event has been learned about after the fact through its effects,rather than being witnessed directly.(388) a. pHF`QhsE`rhR                          vdFhC v@F`Q  ji`sx@s wwwwww

It alsoseems that the fact is generally surprising or unexpected in some way, which makes this mood amarker of mirativity, as this is described by DeLancey (1997).","[291, 292]"

Itmay occur in the main predicate of which the participant in question is an argument, as in (447)a-c and (448)a-b, or in an RP, as in (447)d and (448)c. Further research is necessary to determinecriteria for choosing between these options.

7.2.1   Makah mood-pronominal formsJacobsen (1973) contains the first description of Makah moods and pronouns. My analysis gener-ally agrees with his, but does differ in certain respects. Some differences are merely terminologi-cal, e.g. I have renamed his “nominal” mood the “Relative”. In other places, as he notes, alterna-tive analyses of forms are possible given the raw data. My choice of an analytical alternative forMakah has sometimes been influenced by study of the Nuuchahnulth material (and vice-versa).",[271]

Thisambiguity exists in (220)c, for example. The source translates the sentence assuming the firstreading, as if M@r`otKFh ‘a day screen (a board with a painting depicting a mythological subjecton it)’ were the subject of the nominal predicate ptF`bF`BtK F`Q`F`BtK ‘(be) two people on asurface’, but it is just as likely to be a locative RP expanding the reference of ,-F@Bt(K), that is,an adjunct further specifying the identity of the surface the two people are on. The alternativereadings are ‘a day screen has two people on it’ and ‘there are two people on a day screen’. An-other ambiguous Nuuchahnulth example is shown in (221). This sentence is especially interestingbecause it contains two restricted nominal predicates. The first is the main complex predicatehead b`pHbs`phlKBt l@sl@r ‘twenty tribes in a container’; the second is the relative clausex`Y`pQMtj ‘that which is in the hand’, which is adjoined to the demonstrative F`G ‘this’(221)   NUUCHAHNULTH

  Makah is the usual English rendering of the Clallam (a neighboring Salish language) designa-
tion for the tribe. In their own language, the Makah call themselves pihchCC`F@sW and their lan-
guage piHpiHchCC`p. Both words are regular formations based on the root pihchCC`,p,, a place
designation of uncertain reference (Renker & Gunther 1990: 429). The question of an appropriate
name for the other language appearing in the dissertation is difficult. The traditional name in the
anthropological and linguistic literature, Nootka, is not of native origin and disliked by the
community. In 1978, the Southern Wakashan people of Canada adopted the name Nuu-chah-nulth
(mTC@MtK ‘mountain range’) (Arima & Dewhirst 1990: 410). However, as an ethnonym, this
name actually subsumes peoples speaking two languages, those speaking the language formerly
referred to as Nootka and those speaking the closely related Nitinaht or Ditidaht. I follow Naka-
yama (1997a, see especially p. 2) in using Nuuchahnulth in a restricted sense as a linguistic des-
ignation to refer only to the language formerly known as Nootka. Note that I simplify the spelling
by eliminating the hyphens. Ditidaht is referred to as such.
2
  Makah has not been used as a medium of daily communication for decades, and, at the time of
writing, there were only three fluent speakers, all elderly.
3
  Interestingly, in phoneme charts given in his M.A. and Ph.D. dissertations (1931: 10, 1933: 4),
Swadesh did group /F/ and /Y/ with the glottalized consonants. The latter work agrees with Nootka
Texts in grouping the affricates with the stops, but the former has them listed separately.
4
  Sapir and Swadesh refer to them as “voiced continuants”; Rose and Nakayama call them “reso-
nants”.
                                                 350
5
   Sapir and Swadesh label the “Mid” row “Mid-wide”, the “Central” column “Back”, and the
“Back” column “Back Rounded”.
6
   This, incidentally, is the reason Sapir & Swadesh (1939) represent the high back vowels with
the symbol ‘o’, rather than ‘u’. The mid back vowels are represented by them with open o. Ac-
cording to Sapir & Swadesh (1955: 4), by the time Nootka Texts was in press, Sapir had decided
‘u’ was more appropriate. This has been the standard symbol for the high back vowels since Sapir
& Swadesh (1955).
7
  A syllable consists of an obligatory onset consonant followed by a single nuclear vowel, long or
short. The coda may contain zero, one, or more consonants (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 13, Stonham
1994a: 76). Consequently, a nasal (or any other consonant, for that matter) is in the coda if it im-
mediately precedes another consonant, or occurs in word-final position.
8
   In early works, Sapir wrote the murmur vowel with either ‘i’, e.g. ,pElhK ‘round thing’ in
(1911a: 16) (-phlK in current orthography) and hmhjv,hgk ‘fire in the house’ in (1921) (FhmjihK in
current orthography), or with ‘i’, e.g. ""ιmhj# ‘fire’ in (1924).
9
  [L] indicates the suffix requires the first vowel of its base to be long. See §3.3.1. The colon dia-
critic is explained in §3.1.
10
    This rule correctly places primary accent in Makah, but there may be secondary accent at work
as well since there are sometimes perceived prominences in addition to the primary accent, espe-
cially on long vowels. It is unclear whether these are merely phonetic correlates of vowel length
or part of the accent system. Accent in Makah is stress accent, which is probably the case in Nuu-
chahnulth as well.
11
   Wilson (1986) formulates a similar rule in metrical terms. See also Stonham (1994a, b).
12
   Jacobsen (1969b: 13-14) also discusses Sapir & Swadesh’s (1939) treatment of labialization.
13
    Vowel-glide contraction also operates synchronically in some cases. See, for example, discus-
sion of (65)b in §3.3.1.
14
    However, caution is required here because Makah vowel-glide sequences do not always corre-
spond to persistently long vowels in Nuuchahnulth. For example, corresponding to the Makah
suffix ,Cdx`K ‘... many days’ we find Nuuchahnulth ,CHK, which contains a long vowel that neu-
tralizes as normal.
15
    ,hmj is derived from the underlying form ,(C)hmji by other processes. See below and §3.3.8.
Incidentally, a more accurate, but also more cumbersome, gloss for l`ji, is ‘conduct a commer-
cial exchange, esp. buy’.
16
    There are apparent exceptions in this environment, e.g. l`jFTjs ‘purchased goods’ (< l`ji,
+ ,-FTjs ‘obtained by ...’).
17
   For exceptions see §5.5.4.

    There are several other templates in addition to those listed in here that appear in aspectual for-
mations (e.g. [RepR], [IterL]). These are described in Chapter 6.
19
     The [LR] abbreviation is introduced in Jacobsen (1997a) as a substitute for Sapir and
Swadesh’s original symbol [RG].

    This process, traditionally referred to as “hardening” by Wakashanists, occurs in both branches
of Wakashan, and is one of the best known aspects of the phonology. Confining ourselves first to
sources that deal only or primarily with Nuuchahnulth, we can cite (among others) Sapir (1911a:
16; 1924: 82, note 1, 90, note 62; 1938), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238), Swadesh (1933: 6), Rose
(1976, 1981: 18-19), Nakayama (1997a: 16-19). On hardening (glottalization) in Ditidaht, see
Swadesh & Swadesh (1933: 200), and, for Makah, see Jacobsen (1996) and §3.4.2.

22
   Cf. also Sapir’s (1938, reprint 1949: 231-32) discussion of the historical origins of glottaliza-
tion, where he argues that it is unlikely to have been simply a result of coalescence of consonant
+ glottal stop clusters.
23
   Like glottalization (§3.3.2), lenition (referred to as “softening” by Wakashanists) is a well de-
scribed process, and the two are often treated together. Many of same sources are relevant: Sapir
(1924: 92, note 84; 1938), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238), Swadesh (1933: 5-6), Rose (1976,
1981: 18), Nakayama (1997a: 19-20). On lenition in Ditidaht, see Swadesh & Swadesh (1933:
199), and, for Makah, see Jacobsen (1996) and §3.4.2.
24
   Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238) cite QtX`r ‘good on the ground’, but this form is not attested in
the corpus. QtKF`r is found at NA 15.18.

   Final /a/ is present underlyingly, but does not appear in the surface form due to a rule of final
vowel deletion in Makah (§3.4.3) (cf. also Jacobsen 1971).

32
   This, incidentally, raises the question of the historical source of modern Southern Wakashan
non-labialized velars, which, with the exception of /w/, are by no means rare in the present day
languages. That is, if PW velars became alveo-palatals, whence the velar in morphemes like the
N, M root j`, ‘stick-like object protruding’?
33
   TRANS = transitivizing suffix used with stative or intransitive verbs (Boas 1947: 241, #6); NOM
= nominal suffix (Boas 1947: 323). Thanks to Emmon Bach for checking my Kwakwala forms.
He drew my attention to the fact that Boas (1947: 353) erroneously writes the ‘lick’ root in (120)c
with a plain voiceless velar stop. I have substituted the correct glottalized form per Lincoln and
Rath (1980: 244).
34
   See Haas (1969: 111-112, 115-120) for discussion and examples of similar correspondences
between Nuuchahnulth and Ditidaht.
35
   This word, like many others with original */Wi/, now contains morphophonemic /Gi/ (§3.3.2).
36
   Makah voiceless stops undergo the allophonic process of coda aspiration described for Nuu-
chahnulth in §2.1.
37
   This example and the next are found on page 16 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in
Jacobsen’s possession.
38
   Jacobsen (1996) indicates these segments with a capital barred-l.
39
   Jacobsen (p.c.) has recorded this suffix as ,#` and ,#h. The ,#t form appears in my data.
40
   This example is found on page 9 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in Jacobsen’s posses-
sion.
41
   See §2.5 for accent.
42
   Some speakers change /@/ preceding /v/ to /N/ so they would have [c`9Kn9w].
43
   Interestingly, Ditidaht shows similar patterns of syncope except that, in Ditidaht, it is the sec-
ond of the two vowels that deletes rather than the first. See Swadesh & Swadesh (1933).
44
   This first-syllable shortening sometimes seems to apply also in words that have undergone ep-
enthesis (§3.4.3).
45
   More fully translated in Makah as ‘good, rich tasting, full of fat (said of shellfish)’.
46
   Actually, the question of whether Makah, Nuuchahnulth, and other languages with lexical ver-
balizing suffixes can be characterized as incorporating is controversial. I am agreeing with the
                                                352
view expressed by Sapir (1911b) and Mithun (1984), among others, that these languages are not
incorporating. See Jacobsen (1993: 266-67, note 2) for discussion.
47
   Swadesh himself (1933: 11, note 1) compares them to the Latin enclitic conjunction -que.
48
   At least one of these, x@K ‘yonder’, is attested in Makah as well.
49
   See §4.4.1 for brief comments on grammatical relations. The relevant aspect of this topic here
is that a subject category can be justified for Southern Wakashan.
50
   Cf. Swadesh (1933: 101-02).
51
   This characteristic of Nuuchahnulth and Southern Wakashan languages contrasts sharply with
the situation in Salish languages, which are generally quite careful about indicating transitivity.
52
   However, equational clauses involving personal names, place names, and RPs that contain the
article do require a copular element. See below for discussion.
53
   See Chapter 8, note 114 for discussion of classification of property words.
54
   Jacobsen (1979a: 114) tentatively reports a possible restriction in Makah against occurrence of
the future tense clitic with nouns. However, I was able to elicit several examples of nouns with
this clitic with no difficulty.
55
   A few exceptions to this generalization have turned up in Nuuchahnulth, but syntactic predi-
cates expressing names all seem to have existential readings, e.g. there at the door is Codfish-
always-getting it (the name of a family crest), rather than equational readings.
56
   See §8.2.3 for the forms of independent pronouns.
57
   Cf. Sapir (1924: 86, note 31)
58
   This claim does not apply to proper names, which, as discussed in §4.4.3.2, cannot function as
(syntactic) predicate heads.
59
   Swadesh (1939: 82) proposes the same analysis, labeling the Nuuchahnulth article a “subject
relative” in a list of modal formatives and glossing it ‘he who is, does’.
60
   However, the proper analysis of Makah RPs with possessive clitics, which have essentially the
same syntactic distribution as the article, (e.g. E`o`b<rhr ‘my canoe’) is as yet unclear.
61
   Some have suggested that referring expressions in Salish languages are also nominalized predi-
cates or clauses. See, for example, van Eijk (1997) on Lillooet and Thompson, Thompson, &
Egesdal (1996) on Thompson. Similar claims have been made for other languages of the Ameri-
cas. See Comrie & Thompson (1985: 391-95) for a brief review.
62
   Relative roots do have the special property of remaining the grammatical head of the word
when affixed by nuclear lexical suffixes, which otherwise become head themselves. See §5.1.
63
   These might be considered a kind of equational clause (§4.4.3.2).
64
   Often it is also possible to express manner of action and relation in a single derived verb, with
the manner expressed by the base and the relation by a suffix, e.g. M J`b,hx@, N J`b,H pinch-
give.PERF ‘pinch sth off and give it to’, M C`p,hx@, N C`p,`xH push-give.PERF ‘push sth to sb’,
M Bhbj,hx@ throw-give.PERF ‘throw sth to sb’, N b`r,Hbr chase-bringing.along ‘chase sth
along’. For an example of the first word, see (201)b.
65
   With some hesitation he terms this construction “serialization”, a characterization I find mis-
leading because of the many differences between the Southern Wakashan construction and con-
structions called “serial verb” constructions in other languages, e.g. 1) any number of predicates
can be so combined (although more than two or three is uncommon), 2) the set of predicates from
which bare absolute predicates can be drawn is open-ended, 3) any lexical item can fill the role of
main predicate or of the bare absolute.
66
   “Serialization combines multiple clauses into a unit that expresses a single state of affairs (=
event or state), i.e. a predication” (Nakayama 1997a: 115).
                                                 353
67
    See Anderson (1985: 9-10) and Spencer (1991: 37-39) for introductory discussion. In Sapir’s
(1921: 142-43) morphological typology, Nuuchahnulth (or Nootka, in his terminology) is classi-
fied as having a polysynthetic level of synthesis and “agglutinative (symbolic tinge)” technique.
68
   See Fortescue (1994) for more detailed characterization of polysynthetic languages.
69
   In a 100-word sample from Text 2 in Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 19-21), Jacobsen (1993: 266)
counts an average of 3.66 morphemes per word in Nuuchahnulth, which just slightly lower than
Greenberg’s (1954) figure of 3.72 morphemes per word in a similar sized sample from Eskimo.
70
   Figure 2 should be understood as a static representation of the structure of existing words,
rather than a generative device for creating new words. Without extensive filtering or constraint
mechanisms, Figure 2 will generate many impossible words.
71
   This statement does not apply to words formed on relative roots like N x`pi, M x`p@ ‘one
who, that which’, which always determine the category of the resultant word regardless of suffix
type, e.g. N x`pi plus the verbalizing suffix N ,FhC ‘clothed in ...’ forms the noun x`piFhC
‘clothing, what one is wearing’ rather than the verb *‘wearing sth that is ...’.
72
   The terms “core” and “peripheral” are borrowed from Nakayama (1997a), where they are used
in a different sense.
73
   See Haas (1972) for more on Nootkan root structure.
74
   As mentioned later (see note 114 in Chapter 8), it is not clear if evaluative and dimensional
terms are a subclass of verbs or constitute a separate class of adjectives.
75
   See Rose (1981: 284-89) for a different classification scheme.
76
   Eskimo languages also have suffixes of this type, which are sometimes called “post bases” in
the specialist literature (e.g. Jacobson 1984, Miyaoka 1996). Eskimo, Wakashan, and Quileute are
strikingly similar in their reliance on these suffixes to the virtual exclusion of other word-
formation techniques. Eskimo languages are even more extreme than Wakashan and Quileute in
this respect.
77
   Other works refer to nuclear suffixes as “governing” suffixes, a term I avoid since nuclear suf-
fixes sometimes do not “govern” the base in the sense used in current grammatical theory.
78
   This statement is generally true, but oversimplified. Certain restrictive path-orientation suffixes
have the effect of deriving verbs due to their inherent perfective aspect (§5.5.1). In these cases,
the restrictive suffix could be considered the grammatical head, but the base remains in some
sense the main semantic element.
79
   These types roughly correspond to Swadesh’s (1933, 1939) governing action and governing
state suffixes.
80
   Rose (1981: 357-58) categorizes most of my verbalizing state suffixes as “adjectival” rather
than “verbal” suffixes, but, assuming her (p. 344) definition of the adjective class, it is not clear
how this could be correct. Jacobsen (1979a: 139) refers to Makah ,h9b ‘belonging to ...’ as form-
ing adjectives, but since he considers Makah adjectives a subtype of intransitive verb, there is no
disagreement with the present analysis.
81
   Locale suffixes are called “zone” suffixes in Davidson (1999).
82
   The initial vowel is shortened due to insertion of the long epenthetic vowel (§3.4.3).
83
   “The use of suffixes for adding new material ideas to the initial morpheme is common to a re-
stricted area inhabited by all the Kwakiutl dialects, Nootka [and other Southern Wakashan lan-
guages––MD], Quileute, and Salish. Outside of this area it is unknown. Its closest analogue is
found in the suffixes of the Eskimo language” (Boas 1947: 236).
84
   This root element must go back to Proto-Wakashan, cf. Kwakwala forms such as vhP5mWi` ‘to
fail to go straight to a person’ (Boas 1947).
                                                 354
85
   My analysis of Southern Wakashan aspect draws on that of Swadesh (1931, 1933, 1939), Sapir
& Swadesh (1939), and Rose (1981), but, as will be seen, differs in certain respects from each of
these.
86
    Actually, to be more precise, aspect is indicated by the final morphological constituent of a
stem. This is often a single morpheme, as stated in the text, but may also be a combination of two
or more restrictive spatial suffixes, which together have a single aspectual value (§5.1), or an as-
pectually significant CV template applied to a base.
87
   “[A]ll verbs have durative and momentaneous, or inceptive, aspects, most have also at least one
iterative aspect, and many have still other aspects” (Sapir 1924: 82, note 1). “The aspect system
consists of a set of categories based on two primary aspects, durative and momentaneous.” (Sapir
& Swadesh 1939: 240).
88
    “We may class Nootka words into three semantic types, on the basis of their meaning in the
durative and momentaneous aspects” (Swadesh 1931: 24).
89
    These definitions were formulated for momentaneous and durative categories in Ditidaht, but
can be shown to reflect Swadesh’s thoughts on Nuuchahnulth as well, although these were never
so succinctly expressed.
90
   Some authors (including Klein) reserve the term “aspect” for viewpoint aspect.
91
   In fact, potential for occurring with the graduative imperfective is a good test for determining
whether a base is perfective.
92
   Rose (1981: 275) describes the graduative morpheme as [L] in Kyuquot dialect, but examples
like perfective M, N v`g@j ‘go’: graduative M, N v@g`j ‘going’ show that it must be [L+S] in
Tseshaht and Makah.
93
   The term “continuative” is from Rose (1981). Sapir & Swadesh (1939) simply call this aspect
the ‘durative’, not differentiating it terminologically from the ,`ji/,tj durative described in
§6.5.2.
94
   This kind of “what-if” elicitation technique was suggested to me by Ann Renker (p.c.).
95
   Formation of the repetitive in Makah is first described in Jacobsen (1971).
96
   Iterative formation is first described for Makah in Jacobsen (1971).
97
   Note in this regard that the formal resemblance between the Habitual enclitic <F`9K` (§7.4.2)
and iterative II morphology may not be coincidental.
98
   See also Swadesh (1933: 8-11), Rose (1981: 291-92), and Nakayama (1997a: 21-23).
99
    Jacobsen (1973) describes a “relative” formative ,W (e.g. in vhJHsW vdFhC ‘no one is sleep-
ing’). Since I judge this to be a specialized use of the peripheral suffix ,(W)W ‘while, meanwhile’
rather than a clitic, it is not discussed in this chapter.
100
     See also Rose (1981: 212-234) for Kyuquot dialect forms and Nakayama (1997: 30-41) for
Ahousaht.
101
    The Inferential I is, however, listed in Sapir (1924: 101, note 178).
102
     These formatives are not mentioned in Sapir & Swadesh (1939), but are listed in Swadesh
(1939: 82-83).
103
     Two other Makah morphemes given by Jacobsen (1986) as evidentials, ,P`ch and Jtj, are
here analyzed as specialized peripheral layer evidential uses of lexical suffixes rather than as cli-
tics. In this regard, it is significant that <oh9s follows the temporal specifier, which shows it must
be a clitic, but -P`ch and ,Jtj precede it. This does not guarantee peripheral suffix status, but is
consistent with it.
104
     Jacobsen (1973) refers to the first of these moods as the “informational interrogative” and the
second as the “confirmational interrogative”.
                                                355
105
    There are a few examples of it attaching to a lone demonstrative in Nuuchahnulth, however,
e.g. F`GjTFh ‘that one’.
106
    Tseshaht x@ is probably cognate with the morpheme g@ in Kyuquot dialect that Rose (1981:
40) describes as a definite article.
107
    In Makah, the article itself may be extended by demonstrative elements: <?hp`9c proximate
article, e.g. PhcHkhp@c ‘this dog’, <?hp@b distal article, e.g. PhcHkhp`9b ‘that dog’.
108
    See Rose (1981: 206, ex. 43; 209, ex. 60-61)
109
     Rose (1981), Rose & Carlson (1984), Whistler (1985), Emanatian (1986), and Nakayama
(1997b) may be consulted for further discussion of passivization in Nuuchahnulth, especially the
controversy over whether this construction should be properly be considered a passive or an in-
verse. The reader will correctly infer from my labeling the morpheme in question “passive-
inverse” that I consider the question to be terminological. The Southern Wakashan construction
simply mixes properties associated with constructions called “passive” and “inverse” in other
languages. It appears to be intransitive like the English passive, but is subject to person and topi-
cality hierarchies like inverse constructions in Algonquian languages.
110
    An obvious alternative analysis of this construction some have suggested describes ,(C)hK as an
object case marker. Rose (1981: 62-67) presents several arguments against such an analysis and
for a multi-clausal analysis like the one given here.
111
    This is perhaps a typo for ,@bxhm, the normal shape of this suffix, cf. Sapir & Swadesh (1939:
319).
112
    Makah has a morpheme ,""tW seems analogous to the Nuuchahnulth irrealis clitic, but it is not
yet fully analyzed.
113
    In formal speeches first person singular forms may have plural reference (i.e. ‘I’ = ‘we’).
114
    The classification of many words expressing property concepts is unclear. This uncertainty
primarily involves free roots like dimension terms, e.g. M, N F`p ‘wide’, M FhFHWi`, N FHGi
‘big’, and evaluative terms, e.g. M QtKT, N QtK ‘good’, and also some words with the durative
aspect suffix, e.g. M, N Ihrtj ‘white’, M, N F`C`ji ‘propped, wedged up’. Most property words
probably belong to a subclass of verbs, as proposed by Jacobsen (1979a), but some may consti-
tute a separate class of adjectives (Rose 1981). Their syntax requires further investigation before
definitive classification can be made. Other property words such as those formed with suffixes I
have classified as verbalizing state suffixes (§5.4.1), e.g. M ,chs, N ,mhs ‘stocked with ...’, M, N
-h9b ‘belonging to ...’, are more clearly verbs.
115
    Jacobsen (1979a: 84-108) includes a thorough review of various proposals concerning South-
ern Wakashan word classes in both the primary and secondary literature.
116
    This is a different sense of “nominal” from the one used in the preceding list of word classes,
where the word simply means ‘having the character of a noun, noun-like’.
117
    I therefore disagree with Nakayama’s (1997a: 64) contention that “...[T]here is no strong for-
mal basis for positing word classes in Nuu-chah-nulth. That is, there is no unique and constant
correspondence between sets of words and formal markers or formal structuring patterns that jus-
tifies grammatical classes among words.”
118
    Note also that this is a rare example of a post-head predicate modifier hosting a clitic.
119
    The speaker is the mythological culture hero Kwatyaat, whose speech is characterized by in-
serted /x/’s (Sapir 1915, reprint 1949: 186; Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 210, footnote 8).
120
    Jacobsen (1979a: 106) makes the same claim: “[T]he momentaneous [i.e. perfective––MD]
formation ... derives verbs from stems of other classes.”

Citation of Nuuchahnulthsuffixes is based on the more-or-less complete list provided by Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 316-34).","[365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372]"

7.2.2   Nuuchahnulth mood-pronominal formsEarlier descriptions of Tseshaht Nuuchahnulth mood and pronominal subject forms are found inSapir (1924), Swadesh (1933: 16-17), Swadesh (1939: 82), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 242-43),Swadesh (1948a), and Haas (1969).100 The analysis contained herein is along the lines suggestedby Sapir (1924), although the Indicative paradigm listed by Sapir (1924: 82, note 1) does notsegment the modal formative from the pronominal endings.","[275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280]"
"She also reports a dominance hierarchy among certain templates that determines which will pre-vail in combination. These possibilities require further investigation for Tseshaht. Incidentally,affixes are frequently associated with different templates in Kyuquot and Tseshaht, e.g. -(b)rS`K‘reciprocally’ is neutral in Tseshaht but associated with template (i) in Kyuquot (Rose 1981: 361).
                                                 47    Some affixes are associated with more than one template. Sometimes the meaning of the affixdepends on which template is used.

"    By far the majority of suffixes are lexical suffixes. Lexical suffixes are a Northwest Coastareal phenomenon that also appears in Salish languages, and Quileute.76 They earned this namebecause they have meanings more typical cross-linguistically of open-class lexical morphemesthan closed-class grammatical morphemes. They express a wide range of concepts, and research-ers on languages that have them have proposed various semantic classification schemes. Boas(1947: 236-7) expresses reservations about classifications of this sort on the grounds they imposecategories of the researchers’ languages on the languages of study, but concludes in the end thatthey are harmless and descriptively useful as long as it is clear that they make no claim to repre-sent native classifications.
                                                180    His worries about imposition of external categories on the object language are clearly well-founded, and even today this is a common pitfall of comparative semantic research. Lucy (1994:624) describes such research as follows:         Lexical items are grouped together [in analyses of this sort] and analyzed as a
         coherent set not because speakers of those languages group them together in a set
         as revealed, for example, by common grammatical treatment, but because the
         analyst so groups them. And meanings are assigned not on the basis of close ex-
         amination of actual usage, but on the basis of rough functional equivalence with
         forms in our own language. Thus an external framework is imposed on the lan-
         guage in place of a framework deriving from its native logic.","[195, 196]"

There are other suffixes beginningwith each of these consonants that never undergo initial deletion. Deleting consonants are sym-bolized with parentheses, e.g. ,(p)@r ‘daughter of ...’.

"Class-inclusion predicatesIn Makah and Nuuchahnulth, nominals may function directly as predicate heads with no interven-ing copular element.52 They take predicate clitics exactly as verbal predicates do: there are no re-strictions on the predicate clitics they may occur with. The words in (205)-(206) show Makahnouns and property words as heads of class-inclusion predicates; that is, predicates denoting aclass of entities the subject is asserted to be a member of.53 Example (207) shows an intransitiveverbal predicate for comparison. The coding of each clause type is identical: the mood and pro-nominal clitics are attached directly to the predicate head in all cases.

3.2 Automatic alternations
3.2.1   UmlautThe low central vowels /` @/ are raised and fronted to /d D/ when followed in the next syllableby /h/ or /H/ and only /F/ intervenes (Sapir 1924: 85, note 22). This environment may occur inderivation when a suffix or clitic beginning with glottal stop and a high front vowel is added to abase ending in /`/ or /@/ (26)a-b, or it may occur morpheme-internally (26)c:

Sapir (1924: 85-86,note 22) writes: “[T]hese [umlauted] vowels are felt as distinct from secondary d, ε, and D …that are merely lowered from h, H because of preceding or following velar consonant.” (By “ve-lar” he means “uvular.” It is unclear why there is no mention of the lowering by pharyngeals). Healso describes the umlauted vowels as “open”, probably indicating a lax quality versus the tenserquality of the high vowels lowered by the pharyngeals (and uvulars). The fact that the two sets ofphones, the umlaut set and the lowered set, are distinct removes the possibility of a violation ofbi-uniqueness, i.e. a situation in which a single allophone belongs to two phonemes.","[48, 49]"

"    There are some complexities with regard to vowel length. Often, length is unchanged in ei-ther the reduplicated syllable or the original first syllable. Sometimes, however, one finds theoriginal first syllable lengthened (e.g. M ji`Qji@C ‘back up at intervals; lobster’ < ji`, ‘movebackwards’, N rtQrTj ‘take up at intervals’ in (350)c), or both vowels lengthened (e.g. MB@B@FtpR ‘gaffing fish’ < *B`Ftp, not attested outside this formation, N m@rpm@rpR < m`rp,‘beat time with sticks’ at NA 398.14). Rose (1981: 277) analyzes forms in Kyuquot dialect like

She writes that theiterative “denotes sporadic occurrence of an event” (p. 271), while the so-called “graduative itera-tive” “indicates that the iterativity is more intense, frequent, or progressive” (p. 277). I have beenunable to evaluate this claim for the Tseshaht corpus because forms with both vowels lengthenedare exceedingly rare, only two have turned up so far, and the translations are not precise enoughfor comparison with other forms. Makah iteratives with one or two long vowels do not seem tohave contrasting forms with short vowels.","[257, 258]"
    Throughout the preceding discussion readers may have noted the lack of any forms with thirdperson subjects and first or second person non-subjects. This is explained by the hierarchical pat-tern of subject choice described in §4.4.2 and §7.3.5; propositions with a third person A and firstor second person P are expressed by a passive-inverse construction with the first or second Pcoded as subject.,[275]
"    Underlying forms, which do double duty as citation forms, frequently contain diacritics thatspecify how or if certain morpheme-specific rules apply. It has not been possible to avoid usingmorphemes with diacritics in examples before the diacritics themselves have been introduced;readers may consult the list of abbreviations and symbols after the Table of Contents for briefexplanations of them. Most are used in the same way as in Sapir and Swadesh’s works, wherethey were originally introduced (see especially Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 236-39), although theirdiacritic conventions have been simplified in a few cases. Some of their original diacritics areused to abbreviate sets of allomorphs (cf. McCawley 1967: 108): they represent the phonologicalproperties of each allomorph in a single citation form by “superimposing” the allomorphs on oneanother. Sometimes, however, the present analysis posits a single underlying form for such lexi-cal items rather than an allomorph set, which eliminates the need for Sapir and Swadesh’s dia-critic. For example, labialized consonants alternate with their non-labialized homorganic counter-parts in word-final position and a few other environments (§3.2.2), e.g. we find l`l@rhX`ji,Hb
                                                 28‘belonging to a mud shark’, but l`l@rhX`j ‘mud shark’ without the suffix. In Sapir andSwadesh’s analysis, the ‘mud shark’ root has two allomorphs, the word-final allomorph/l`l@rhX`j/ and the pre-vowel allomorph /l`l@rhX`ji,/. They merge these to produce thecitation form l`l@rhX`j(i,), where the parentheses and hyphen show that the labialized allo-morph appears before vowel-initial suffixes. The analysis proposed in §3.2.2, on the other hand,posits the underlying form l`l@rhX`ji and an automatic delabialization rule. With this analysisthe parentheses and hyphen are redundant: since no labialized final consonant fails to alternate inthe relevant environment, there is no need for a special mark to signal the alternation.12    Many of the alternations described in this chapter are triggered by affixation. The languagedistinguishes an inner layer of affixes, mostly suffixes but also a few infixes, from an outer layerof enclitics. The inner affixes include various aspectual formatives and “lexical” suffixes, suffixeswith relatively concrete meanings like the verbalizing suffix ,rhlC ‘doing ritual for ...’. The cli-tics are more loosely joined to their host phonologically, and typically have more abstract gram-matical functions than inner-layer affixes, coding grammatical categories like tense, mood, andperson and number of the subject. The inner affixes and the clitics behave differently with regardto several of the phonological alternations described. Differences will be noted piecemeal as wego along, and a summary list of them can be found in Chapter 7.","[43, 44]"
"    Finally, there is an obvious difference in denotation between lexical suffixes and clitics. Aswe have seen, suffixes often have semantic content akin to that of independent lexical items, oreven phrases, in English, e.g. M ,(ji)h9K [L+S] ‘making ...’, ,hctW ‘looking for ...’, -`chK [L] ‘onthe neck’. The meanings of clitics (e.g. tense, mood) are much more abstract by comparison, andclearly mark them as belonging to the grammatical, rather than the lexical level, of the language.",[269]

"Swadesh (1939: 79) points out two lexical suffixes with both obvious phonological and semanticsimilarity to an extant root: the path suffix N ,l`K,, M ,a`K, ‘moving about’ with root N l`K,‘move’, M a`K`s, ‘(large object) tremble, shake’, and the verbalizing suffix N, M -v@(K) ‘say ...’with root N, M v@ ‘say’. We might also compare the root N FHpG, ‘tell, narrate’ (probably re-duced from earlier *Fhx`pG,) to the verbalizing suffix N ,hx`pG [R] ‘sing ... song’, or, in Kyu-quot dialect, ‘tell ... story’ (Rose 1981: 356). A final example involves the primitive root elementN, M vh, that occurs as a component of various roots expressing negative concepts, e.g. N vhj,M vhjH ‘not’, N vHX`, M vHx` ‘never’, M vHa` ‘not know, recognize a person’, N vhF`ji‘invulnerable, unafraid’, N, M vH,p, ‘angry, unpleasant; stormy, bad (weather)’, and many oth-ers.84 This element evidently occurs as a suffix in a single Nuuchahnulth derivative, rtvHX`j‘instrument for not holding, nothing to hold’ (< rt, ‘hold’ + ,vH + ,X`ji ‘... instrument’)(Swadesh 1933: 154). These root/suffix pairs exhaust readily detectable examples.

Rose 1981: 271-74, Nakayama 1997a: 28), e.g. B`wB`wR ‘spearing every now andthen’ (< B`wi, ‘(to) spear’ + iterative I). These translations might imply that the repetitions mustbe temporally distant from one another, perhaps days or weeks apart, and that the series as wholeoccurs over a considerable length of time, but no such restrictions exist: B`wB`wR can denote aseries of events that lasts only a few minutes. The temporally extended sense may be more typicalthough; in fact, iteratives sometimes have a habitual connotation, as shown by their tendency tolexicalize as deverbal nouns (§8.2.1), e.g. CHCHv`GrTK ‘bureau (of drawers), lit. gets pulled outat intervals’ < CH ‘pull’ + ,v`Grt(K) ‘move out’ + iterative II.97    Exceptions have been recorded to the generalization that iterative I and iterative II are merelyformal alternates. For example, Sapir (1924: 87, note 37) notes for the root Qtoj, Qhlj, ‘awake’that the iterative II form (which he calls the “durative iterative”) QTojRHK ‘to be waking up timeand again’ contrasts with the iterative I form (which he calls the “momentaneous iterative”)QtojQtojR or QhljQhljR ‘to keep waking up by fits and starts’. More investigation is neces-sary to see how general the possibility for such contrasts is, but, at this point, it appears limited.","[260, 261]"

        ‘He/she/it is sleeping.’In general, words functioning as predicate heads in main clauses have the greatest potential forhosting clitics. The clitics occur in an ordered sequence of slots following their host (§7.5). Firstcome clitics coding categories like the causative, passive-inverse, and tense. Next are mood andpronominal clitics indexing subjects and, in Makah, some non-subjects. As seen in (153), thirdperson formatives in Makah have fused with mood clitics. In Nuuchahnulth, there is no markingfor third person in most moods. Finally, a word may end with one or more clitics drawn from asmall post-modal set that includes a morpheme expressing the plurality of a third person partici-pant, a morpheme meaning ‘again’, and a habitual marker. See §4.3 for more on clitics and theirplace in the structure of the predicate.",[111]
"Kenstowicz 1994: 57). Thus, the present chapter is concerned with the inventory of consonantand vowel phonemes in Nuuchahnulth. It also touches on ablaut patterns (patterns of functionallysignificant changes in vowel quality and quantity) and the accent system. Chapter 3 then de-scribes the most important automatic and non-automatic (morpheme-specific) phonological alter-nations in Nuuchahnulth. Unfortunately, time has not permitted much discussion of phonotactics,that is, the patterns of the distribution of phonemes in the various units of phonological structure(see, however, §2.3), but other authors have made references to the subject, e.g. Sapir (1911a,1933, 1938), Jacobsen (1969a), Haas (1972), Stonham (1994a), inter alia. Rose (1981: 29-31)provides basic information on phonotactics and morpheme structure in Kyuquot dialect. A briefdiscussion of Makah phonology is provided in §0.",[25]
"    In addition to the graduative, durative, and continuative imperfective aspects, which can becalled “uniplex” imperfective aspects, there are two multiplex aspectual formations, the repetitiveand the iterative. These imply various types of iteration of events versus the essentially steady-state meanings of the uniplex aspects. The repetitive, which expresses events repeated at regularand generally narrow-spaced intervals, is formed by a special reduplication type plus the suffix-(x)`. As we will see below, the repetitive has expanded its function somewhat beyond this inMakah to cover semantic space expressed by the continuative in Nuuchahnulth. The iterative,which expresses irregular iteration, is formed in two ways, one involving reduplication, and theother involving changes to the perfective form of the base.

6.4 PerfectivePerfective aspect indicates that all internal phases or boundaries of a situation are included in theassertion, i.e. are asserted to have taken place; the situation thus is presented as complete relativeto other situations in the discourse context. The exact meaning of the perfective word depends onthe semantics of the base to which the perfective suffix is attached. With punctual bases like MF`bj`s,, N stw, ‘jump’, M, N IhQp, ‘explode’ or M, N ghr, ‘strike with a beating instrument’the perfective expresses the simple occurrence of the event. If the base denotes an event that mayoccur repetitively, the perfective normally has a semelfactive sense –– it expresses a single repeti-tion of the event.","[239, 240]"
"    While it is generally true that Sapir & Swadesh (1939, 1955) do not record the actual pho-netic variation in labialization, even in these texts it can be found in few places. Consider the ex-amples in (34): addition of the Subordinate mood clitic <p@ (§7.2.7) to G`xt ‘ten’, a base end-ing in a rounded vowel, produces a form transcribed variously as G`xtp` or G`xtpi`. As previ-ously mentioned, clitic boundaries are treated like word boundaries for purposes of labialization,so such variation is expected:(34)    G`xtp` or       G`xtpi`
        G`xt<p@

        ‘that there were ten’ (first form at NA 344.20, second at NA 62.33-34)
3.2.3   Reduction of vowel sequencesVowel sequences are not permitted. When two vowels come to be adjacent in the course of deri-vation, the sequence is reduced to a single vowel whose length and quality are determined by thelength and quality of the underlying vowels (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 236-37). The rules for re-duction of vowel sequences that involve the first root vowel (i.e. the vowel following the initial
                                                      37consonant of the root) differ slightly from those for sequences that do not involve the first rootvowel. This involves a bit of morphological conditioning (because the rules need to “know”whether a vowel is the first vowel of a root –– a morphological rather than phonological ques-tion), so reduction of vowel sequences is not a purely phonologically-conditioned process like theother processes in this section, but it is regular, unlike the morpheme-specific processes describedin §3.3.","[52, 53]"

                           pl    <?hb`9                  <r`9have longer shapes when followed by certain post-modal clitics, especially the habitual <`9j(§7.4.2) and the responsive <Rh9 (§7.4.3), e.g. the Set 2 second plural form is<rn9v`C whenfollowed by<`9j: <rNv`C@j ‘you (pl.) always ...’. Presentation of these longer variants ismostly reserved for later sections to avoid cluttering the table with alternate forms. We can notehere, however, that the first person singular Set 1 form is <rh when followed by the habitual andresponsive, otherwise it is <r. The first person plural Set 1 form is <c unless it follows a con-sonant and is not in turn followed by a vowel, in which case it is <hc.",[273]
"This fact can also be used to show that long vowels imposed by templates are not persistentlylong. For example, the suffix ,`oh [L] ‘in the air, erect; standing’ is associated with template (a)[L]; applied to the root b`oji, ‘have head bowed’, the suffix produces the form b@oji`otQ‘bow one’s head’ (the form also includes the perfective aspect suffix ,tQ). Distributive reduplica-tion places the initial vowel in the reduplicated syllable, where it appears short:(44)    b`b@oji`otQ

        PL–have.head.bowed–erect–PERF        ‘each bowed their head’ (NA 449.1)    The requirements for vowel length made by affix templates have precedence over require-ments on length that later rules in the derivation would otherwise impose. Section 3.2.3 describedthe reduction of vowel sequences involving the first root vowel to a single long vowel with thequality of the root vowel. Consider the derivation of FtFTs`G ‘hunt it (whale)’ in (45), repeatedfrom (39):

If, however, the word contains an affix like-hsX`j [LR+S] ‘fearing ...’ that specifies a short second base vowel, this precludes a long vowel;the vowel must be short:(46)    Ft,hsX`j                 underlying form        FTFŭhsX`j                application of CV template (e) [LR+S]        FTFŭsX`j                 reduction of vowel sequence        FTFtsX`j                 resultant form        ‘fear it’    Any portion of a word falling within the domain of a template that already meets the tem-plate’s specifications is unchanged. If template (a) [L] is applied to a word whose initial vowel islong, for example, then the word meets its specifications, and no changes are necessary.    (47) shows suffixes specifying each template with various short monosyllabic roots, exceptg`V`, ‘eat’, which is disyllabic.(47)    a.

B0UG0cB0UG0       FTbFTL`ÊGr`              ‘at the very edge’ (FtL@ ‘as far as’)    An affix-associated template must be satisfied regardless of how long a word is, or how farthe affix is from the portion of the word specified by the template, either in number of syllables orin number of morphemes. The locative suffix -`oh ‘in the air, erect; standing’ selects the (a) tem-plate. If attached to the four syllable (synchronically) monomorphemic base j`Kjhms`ohlK,‘strawberry’, the first syllable must be long even though the affix itself is separated from it byseveral intervening syllables:(48)    j@Kjhms`ohlKÊ`oh                  ‘strawberry up in the air’Similarly, the word F`E`otFhKhl ‘a pad underneath’ consists of four morphemes, the root F`C,‘support with a block or pad’ and three neutral (not associated with a template) suffixes, ,""`ot(K),‘underneath’, ,#hK ‘in the house’, and -hl ‘... thing’ (lit. ‘thing serving as a pad underneath in thehouse’). If affixed by the suffix -GVhmji [L] ‘using ...’, which selects the (a) template, the firstsyllable is lengthened despite the three suffixes between the specifying suffix and the specifiedsyllable:(49)    F@EÊ`otÊFhKÊhlÊGVhmj              ‘using a pad underneath’    Affixes are subject to their own templatic specification if their position in a base is withintheir template’s domain. Let us consider a straightforward example. The suffix -bh9Xtj [L+S]‘going to ...’ is associated with the (b) template, the two-syllable template that requires the firstsyllable of the word to be long and the second syllable short. If this suffix is affixed to a monosyl-labic base such as the relative root pih, ‘whoever, whatever’, the persistently long first syllable of
                                                  45the suffix ends up as the second syllable of the resultant base and is thus subject to shortening bythe template: piHbhXtj ‘wherever one is going’:(50)    underlying        →        B0 UG0 B1 E1        pihÊbh9Xtj        →        pi H b h---Xtj    A word can contain multiple template-specifying affixes (suffixes or infixes). Three types ofinteractions are possible. The affixes can specify 1) the same template, 2) compatible templates,or 3) conflicting templates. The result of the first situation can be predicted from the principles Idescribed above: because a base that conforms to a particular template requires no alteration uponaddition of an affix associated with that template, we would correctly predict that a given tem-plate is only applied once; addition of a second affix associated with the same template as an ear-lier affix will thus produce no change. Example (51) demonstrates this with a word with two af-fixes specifying template (a):(51)    FTrhlCM`Gh
        FtÊrhlC [L]ÊM`Gh [L]
        so.and.so–do.ritual.for–ready.to
        ‘ready to perform a ritual for it’    Assuming that templates are applied in order from left to right as their affixes are added to thebase, we would expect the effects of compatible templates to be cumulative. That is, effects oflater templates are applied to the form that results from application of earlier templates. Exampleslike (52) seem to bear this out:(52)    Y@Y`pl`pJtji`MTG
        Y`pÊl`pÊJtj [R]Ê@Mt(K) [L]Êh9G [L]
        grass–plant–resemble–along.length–PL
        ‘made of hemp rope, pl.’ (NA 63.46)The leftmost non-neutral suffix is -Jtj (,l`p, ‘... plant’ is neutral), which is associated withtemplate (d), initial CV reduplication with nonspecified vowel length. This template applied tothe underlying form Y`pl`pJtj produces Y`Y`pl`pJtj. The (a) template associated with
                                                 46-@Mt(K) [L] ‘along a length’ is then applied producing Y@Y`pl`pJtji`MtK. Addition of the plu-ral suffix ,h9G rounds out the attested form. (The final /K/ of ,@Mt(K) is deleted before the pluralsuffix.)    Following the same logic, conflicting templatic effects ought to be resolved by the later tem-plate undoing the effects of the earlier template. Conflicts always involve conflicting length re-quirements. For example, when a suffix specifying the (a) template (long first syllable) is fol-lowed by a suffix that specifies the (c) template (first and second syllables both short), the resul-tant word should have a short first syllable. Comparison of (53)a-b supports this hypothesis:(53)       a. F@S@MtK
              F`S`Ê@Mt(K) [L]
              thick–along.length

              thick–along.length–very
              ‘very thick along its length’The effect of the (a) template of -@Mt(K) [L] ‘along a length’ has been undone in (53)b by the (c)template associated with ,(p)`p ,`p`p [S+S] ‘very’.","[58, 59, 60, 61, 62]"
