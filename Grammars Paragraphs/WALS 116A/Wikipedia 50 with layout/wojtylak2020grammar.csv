11.2.4 Alternative questionsAn alternative type of questions is formed by a disjunction of two simple polar questions (ofwhich, the second is always negated). The final element in the alternative question is alwaysa negated verb, with rising-falling intonation. This is illustrated in (11.44-46):
(11.44) PedroS    bi-t-ePRED    oo bi-ñe-d-e?PRED
        Pedro     come-LK-3 or come-NEG-LK-3
        ‘Did Pedro come (lit. did Pedro come or didn’t he come)?’
(11.45) FlorA rokoPRED       oo roko-ñe?PRED
        Pedro cook           or rook-NEG
        ‘Did Flor cook (lit. did Flor cook or didn’t she cook)?’
(11.46) (nai-makɨ)S               ɨraɨzi-d-ePRED   oo ɨraɨzi-ñe-d-e?PRED
        ANA.SP-CLF:PR.GR.AN celebrate-LK-3 or celebrate-NEG-LK-3
        ‘Did they celebrate (lit. did they celebrate or they didn’t celebrate)?’
The origin of the discourse linker oo that conjoins the two questions is unclear. It has theform of the Spanish discourse linker o meaning ‘or’. Nowadays, even the Murui elders neverdrop the linker oo in questions that involve the ‘X not X’ opposition. These alternativequestions form a single unit. They can be answered with jɨɨ ‘yes, no’ when the answer isnegative (note the function of jɨɨ is to confirm a positive or a negative value of the
                                                                                                 478
preposition). When the answer is positive, then a verb is repeated without negative marking.","[502, 503]"

Often both mechanisms are combined. The interjection jɨɨ can be interpreted as some type ofagreement rather than a full-fledged positive or negative response item. Examples (10.90-91)illustrate the reading of jɨɨ which ‘agrees’ with the verb’s polarity:
(10.90) a. iraiS bono-dɨ-o?PRED
           fire burn.SMLF-LK-2sg
           ‘Did you set the fire?’
             b. jɨɨ!
                yes
                ‘Yes.’
280
      Murui has no word for ‘bad’. Maraiñede ‘no good’ is the nearest approximation of the English ‘bad’, the
antonym of ‘good’.
281
      Murui has also an independent positive response form ɨjɨ ‘uh-huh/yes’ used by hearers and speakers mainly
as a type of an acknowledgment during narration of traditional stories.
                                                                                               454
(10.91) a. irai bono-ñe-dɨ-o?PRED
           fire burn.SMLF-LK-2sg
           ‘Didn’t you set the fire?’
         b. jɨɨ!
            no
            ‘No.’
Frequently, when as an answer to a negative question, as in (10.91b), the independent wordjɨɨ is stressed, the predicate has a slightly higher pitch, and it is accompanied by a firmheadshake. A negative answer can also be a full clause. (10.92-93) could be the answers toeither (10.90a) or (10.91a) above.
(10.92) bono-dɨ-kuePRED
        burn.SMLF-LK-1sg
        ‘I set the fire. ‘
(10.93) bono-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
        burn.SMLF-NEG-LK-1sg
        ‘I didn’t set the fire. ‘
The negative answer can also consist of the interjection jɨɨ and a full clause combined, as in(10.94-95):
(10.94) (jɨɨ!) bono-dɨ-kuePRED
        yes burn.SMLF-LK-1sg
        ‘Yes, I did set the fire. ‘
(10.95) (jɨɨ!) bono-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
        no burn.SMLF-NEG-LK-1sg
        ‘No, I didn’t set the fire. ‘
When one disagrees, they respond with jɨɨ obligatorily followed by a full clause with reversedpolarity. When a question is positive, as in (10.96), a full clause is marked for negation, as in(10.97); cf. with (10.98). In case of a negative question, as in (10.99), the full clause ispositive, as in (10.100); cf (10.101).
(10.96) kaka-dɨ-o?PRED
        hear-LK-2sg
        ‘Do you understand (lit. hear)?’
                                                                                             455
(10.97) jɨɨ! kaka-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
        no hear-NEG-LK-1sg
        ‘No, I don’t understand.’
(10.98) jɨɨ! (kaka-dɨ-kue)PRED
        yes hear-LK-1sg
        ‘Yes, I understand. ‘
(10.99) KataS bi-ñe?PRED
        Kata     come-NEG
        ‘Didn’t Kata come?’
(10.100) jɨɨ! bi-t-ePRED
         yes come-LK-3
         ‘Yes, she came.’
(10.101) jɨɨ! (bi-ñe-d-e)PRED
         no come-NEG-LK-3
         ‘No, she didn’t came.’
Example (10.102) is a negative answer to the question uru-e-re-dɨ-o? (child-CLF:G-ATT-LK-2sg) ‘Do you have children?’. Additionally, the noun uru-e ‘child’ which is the head of theintransitive predicate, takes negative attributive marking to express lack of possession.
(10.102) jɨɨ! uru-e-ni-dɨ-kuePRED
         no child-CLF:G-PRIV-LK-1sg
         ‘No! I don’t have children.’
The young speakers of Murui negate the ‘positive possession’ expressed with the positiveattributive -re with the standard negative -ñe, as in (10.103a-b). The elders consider this to beincorrect. Once a Murui elder Lucio asked Walter whether he had a boat motor. Walteranswered with (10.103a). Lucio corrected him with (10.103b):
(10.103) a.   W: jɨɨ! moto-re-ñe-dɨ-kue PRED
                 no motor-ATT-NEG-LK-1sg
                 ‘No, I don’t have the motor.’
         b.   L: moto-ni-dɨ-o…PRED    bueñe?
                 motor-PRIV-LK-2sg WHY
                 ‘You don’t have the motor... Why?’
                                                                                                456
Murui has also the sentence final jɨɨ used in narratives, usually followed by a significantpause (see §13.3.1).","[478, 479, 480, 481]"
"(Q2-CLF:SP.PLACE-LOC Tadave exist-LK-3) ‘Where is Tadave?’:

        ‘She is at home.’
(11.49) jo-fo-moLOC
        house-CLF:CAV-LOC
        ‘At home.’
Another frequent way of answering one’s question is the ‘confirmative’ interjection jɨɨ that isused when a speaker ‘agrees’ with the value of the preposition. Simply saying, depending onthe polarity of the verb in the question, jɨɨ will be interpreted as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Theelement in focus, or even a whole clause, may or may not be repeated. Examples are given in(11.50-51):
                                                                                             479

                       ‘Yes! She came.’(11.51) Question:      uzu-ño                 bi-ñe-d-e?PRED

          Answer 1:    jɨɨ!
                       ‘No.’
          Answer 2:    jɨɨ! bi-ñe-d-e?PRED

11.2 Questions ‒ general characteristics
A real question requires an answer, unlike a rhetorical question or an interrogative command(Dixon, 2010, p. 390). Murui distinguishes between content (§11.2.1), polar (§11.2.2), tag(§11.2.3), and alternative questions (§11.2.4). All of these have some phonological andmorphological properties characteristic for them (i.e. different intonation patterns, presenceof a tag, and special kind of morphological elisions). Murui interrogative content words arediscussed in §3.3.4.","[497, 498]"
"While positive interrogatives are questions seeking information (‘Yes or no?’), negativeinterrogatives presuppose negative answers. There is no difference between positive andnegative interrogatives in their intonation contour. They all have the rising-falling type of
                                                                                                443
intonation which is characteristic to all types of interrogative clauses (see §2.4). Negativeinterrogative clauses and their structures are discussed in turn.","[467, 468]"
"
10.3.1 Negative answersMurui lacks independent positive and negative words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’. 281 The language hasthree ways to respond to positive and negative questions. They involve:
          – the interjection jɨɨ whose meaning ‘yes, no’ depending on the polarity of the verb          used in a question, or          – a full clause.",[478]
"11.2.5 Exclamative questions and sentencesInterrogative forms with nɨɨ and buu followed by the focus marker -ka are commonly used inexclamations. An example is given in (11.47) (see also example T2.27 in the Appendix). See(3.99) in §3.3.4 for an example of an exclamative sentence containing buu-ka (Q1-FOC).
(11.47) nɨɨ-ka raifi-yaPRED              [nai-e            dɨne]LOC   erua?

"
A. NEGATIVE DECLARATIVE CLAUSES WITH INTERROGATIVE INTONATION – structurally, suchnegative clauses do not differ from the plain negative declarative constructions. When thistype of negative question is used, there is a slight presupposition that the answer will benegative. Compare the positive question in (10.49) with the negative question in (10.50).
(10.49) [kue dɨga] jaai-aka-dɨ-omɨko?PRED
        1sg WITH go-DES-LK-2du.m
        ‘Do you (two men) want to go with me? (Yes or no?)’

        ‘Sisters (ego feminine), didn’t you clean outside the house? (You probably didn’t)’
In (10.51) a girl was inquiring about her uncle; she asked her cousin if he was making acanoe at the moment. In fact, she wanted to know the real whereabouts of her uncle. Shesuspected that he went to another village, and that was why she could not find him anywhere.
(10.51) [oo moo]A [nai-e            nokae]O fɨno~fɨno-ñe-d-e?PRED

        ‘Your father isn’t making (and making) that canoe? (He is probably not)’
In some specific context-bound situations, negative questions seem to be understood as ‘yesor no’ questions. In the following example (10.52), Rata asked Maria to go and do somethingtogether. Maria seemed to be quite sad that day, and Rata wanted to cheer her up:
(10.52) Maria! jo-fo-moLOC            fɨebi-ñe-no!PRED      [kaɨ dɨga]

        ‘Maria, do not stay home! You do not want to go with us? (Yes or no?)’
                                                                                             444
B. NEGATIVE DECLARATIVE CLAUSES USED FOR 3rd PERSON WITHOUT PREDICATE MARKERS –structures of predicates referring to 3rd person present a peculiarity – the omission ofpredicate markers. They are used exclusively for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural, and aremarked with both the standard negative and the negative attributive markers. Such structuresdo not differ in terms of their intonation from other types of questions. They alwayspresuppose that the answer will be positive. In (10.53), a woman asked her daughter to sweepinside the house while she went to work. She came back a couple of hours later and upon theentering the house, upon entering the house she asked her son:
(10.53) [jo-fo           jerei]O     gaya-ñe?PRED
        house-CLF:CAV inside         sweep-NEG
        ‘Did (she) sweep the house? (She probably has)’
(10.54) is a response of elder Lucio to his wife Clementina. Clementina asked Lucio wherehe left the basket with fruit he brought in the morning.
(10.54) anane-ko-moLOC                i-ñe?PRED
        maloca-CLF:COVER-LOC exist-NEG
        ‘Isn’t it in the maloca? (it’s probably there)’
Another example is presented in (10.55). A man came to the village looking for a localshaman. He kept looking but he did not find him. He asked another man:
(10.55) bi-rui              [kaɨ mano-ri-raɨ-ma]S          Nofɨko-moLOC           jaai-ñe?PRED
        this.CTS-CLF:DAY 1pl heal-DUR-AGT-CLF:DR.M La.Chorrera-LOC                go-NEG
        ‘Didn’t the healer go to La Chorrera today? (he probably has)’
The following examples illustrate verbs without predicative marking followed by thenegative attributive -ni. In (10.56), Sandriela asked Flor if Rata could cook at Flor’s house.","[468, 469]"
"           From the phonological point of view polar and content questions have a distinctintonation. 288 Generally, Murui has three intonation types: falling (A) for declarativesentences, rising-falling (B) for questions and commands, and rising intonation (C) forcalling from a distance. The rising-falling intonation in questions distinguishses the rising-falling (B1) intonation for content questions, rising-falling (B2) intonation for polar questions(B2), and rising-falling (B3) intonation for commands (see §2.4). Morphologically, thecontent questions and the polar questions are marked in similar fashion. 289 Polar questionsdiffer from content questions in the optionality of verbal marking for 3rd person. Murui tagquestions are characterized by the presence of a special tag words erua and ua. In addition tocontent, polar, and tag questions, Murui has also a special kind of alternative question thatinvolves the ‘X not X’ opposition. Gestures, such as raised eyebrows, wide-open eyes andeye contact with the addressee, generally accompany all kinds of questions in Murui.",[498]
"For instance, to answer positively the alternative question in (11.44), one says bi-t-e! (come-LK-3) ‘He came!’.",[503]
"
288
      Intonation being the main marking of polar questions (as opposed to content questions) is encountered in
other languages from Amazonia, e.g. in Hixkaryana, a Carib language (Derbyshire, 1979, 1985).
289
      In many languages this is the case. As Dixon (2012: 389) put it: “(…) a person asks a question because they
want to know something. Polar questions and content questions are two ways of seeking to satisfy this want”.
                                                                                              474
11.2.1 Content questionsContent questions are considered to be questions that seek information and include aninterrogative content word (Dixon, 2012: 400). Generally, interrogative content wordsspecify a part of the proposition for which specific knowledge is sought (see §3.3.4). InMurui, an interrogative content word occurs generally in the position of the omitted coreargument and it ‘replaces’ a core-argument in a particular functional slot. This is illustrated in(11.34) where the interrogative bue ‘what’ appears in the position of an O NP argument. In(11.35) it occurs in the VCC function.

The intonation contour of Murui content questions involves a high rising pitch (marked with↗↗) on the first syllable of the content interrogative content word followed by a fall (seeintonation contour B1 in §2.4). This is illustrated in (11.36):

There is the same kind of intonation pattern as in negated content questions. An interrogativecontent word that refers to non-core arguments is usually fronted and occurs in the clause-initial position. This is illustrated in (11.37).

11.2.2 Polar questionsPolar questions are generally considered to be questions that seek an expression ofconfirmation or negation of the questioned proposition (positive and negative polarquestions). Morphology and syntax of Murui polar interrogatives are identical to those of adeclarative clause. The only true distinction between the content and polar questions (besidethe absence of the interrogative content word) is the intonation: polar questions in Murui areachieved by means of a sharply rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the predicate(content questions have a high rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the interrogativecontent word).","[498, 499, 500]"

10.4 Summary
Murui negation involves the morphological process of affixation, where negative markers areadded to a corresponding positive in both main and subordinate clauses. Negation of Muruipredicates is expressed in two different ways: by the standard negative marker -ñe and thenegative attributive -ni for ‘lack of attribution (ability, property, possession)’. Murui lacksindependent grammatical words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’ (for which jɨɨ is used). Question words canfunction as indefinites. Their positive and negative readings depend on the predicate’spolarity.

Structurally, negative interrogative corresponds to positive interrogative with omittedpredicate markers used for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural (see §11.2). Positiveinterrogatives with the omitted predicate markers have the same ‘yes or no?’ readings asthose which bear such markers (see for instance (10.49) above). An example of a positiveinterrogative with omitted predicate markers is given in (10.58).

If the answer to the negative question is negative, the independent word jɨɨ is stressed and thepredicate has a slightly higher pitch accompanied by a firm headshake (see §10.3.1).","[469, 470]"
"        Any declarative clause may become a polar interrogative by using a subtype of arising-falling contour (B2) that involves a high rising pitch that falls on the first syllable ofthe last word of a clause and is followed by a fall. There is no distinctive intonationpatterning between positive and negative polar questions. (11.38) is an example of thepositive polar question. The sharply rising intonation is over the verb jaai(de) ‘go’:

        ‘You are hungry, you didn’t eat at the jungle garden?’
Polar questions in Murui have a unique feature that other types of questions or any kind ofdeclarative clauses do not have. There is an optional omission of the verb inflection for the3rd person, e.g. jaai? (go) ‘Did (he) go?’ and jaai-ñe? (go-NEG) ‘Didn’t (he) go?’ instead of
                                                                                                                476
the normal jaai-d-e? (go-LK-3) ‘Did (he) go?’ and jaai-ñe-d-e? (go-NEG-LK-3) ‘Didn’t (he)go?’. All being the same, even in those instances, the intonation does not change.","[500, 501]"

3.3.4       Interrogative content wordsMurui distinguishes between content, polar, tag, and alternative questions. All of these havesome phonological and morphological properties characteristic of them, such as differentintonation patters (see §11.2). This section focuses on interrogative content words.",[191]
Commonly used answers to questions and greeting formulae are dicussed in §11.2.6-7.,[498]
"       Murui distinguishes between content, polar, tag, alternative, and exclamativequestions. All of these have some phonological and morphological properties characteristic to

them (i.e. different intonation patterns, presence of a tag, and a special kind of morphologicalelisions). All interrogative content words are based on two free forms: buu ‘who’ and nɨɨ‘which, where’. To express meanings like ‘what’, ‘where’, and ‘when’, buu and nɨɨ takeclassifiers, e.g. nɨ-rui? (Q2-CLF:DAY) ‘when (lit. which day)?’. Question words can alsofunction as indefinite words; their positive or negative reading depends on the polarity of theverb, as in (1.15a-b).

Murui canonical and non-canonical imperatives are usually formally marked, and havespecial paralinguistic features such as intonation, frequently accompanied by distinct facialexpressions. Murui has canonical imperatives (that is those which are directed to 2nd person)and non-canonical imperative forms for 1st person (with hortative meanings). There is nojussive for 3rd person. Imperatives can be marked with a special aspectual marker -kai whichfollows the imperative suffix and indicates urgency and expectation of an immediateresponse. Compare the examples below:
(1.16) gui-ño! (eat-IMP) ‘eat!’
(1.17) gui-ño-kai! (eat-IMP-RAPID) ‘eat quickly!’Additionally, there are a number of imperative strategies, which involve among others futureevent nominalizations, e.g. maka-ye (walk-FUT.E.NMLZ) ‘go walking (lit. future action ofwalking)’. Murui questions and commands are discussed in Chapter 11.","[34, 35]"
"
    3.2.1    Adverbs    Murui adverbs constitute a semi-closed word class. They are modifiers to verbs and    predicates (never used as predicate heads); the majority cannot take case marking (but some    can be marked for the topical non-S/A marker -na). The majority of Murui adverbs are of    adjectival origin (where deadjectival forms function like adverbs; these constitute an open    word-class); other types form closed word classes. Another distinguishing property of    adverbs is that they answer the question nɨeze? ‘how’, rather than bue? ‘what’ or nɨe?    ‘which’ (see §3.3.4). Murui distinguishes between adverbs of manner and place. The    properties of the Murui adverbs are summarized below:

A. ADVERBS OF MANNER – on morphological grounds, adverbs of manner can be divided intoa number of classes:
A1. OPEN CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN MARKED WITH -re – most ofthese manner adverbs are of adjectival origin (and as such can be used as heads of intransitivepredicates). They belong to an open class and cannot take case marking. This is illustrated in(3.32), where the adjective jea- ‘dirty’, followed by the positive attributive -re, modifiers theverb eruaɨ(de) ‘look’:
(3.32) bi-kos                   jea-re       eruaɨ-d-ePRED
       this.CTS-CLF.REP:DOG dirty-ATT        look-LK-3
       ‘This (dog) looks dirty.’
A2. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN (OPEN WORD CLASS) MARKEDWITH -re – a small group of adjectives, which have the positive attributive -re as a part of theroot (rather than a separate suffix, see §3.1.3), obligatorily take the topical non-S/A marker-na in adverbial position. This is illustrated in (3.33), with the adjective mare ‘good’modifying a verb.
(3.33) [kue jɨko]S mare-na                   joruaɨ-d-ePRED
       1sg dog     good.ATT-N.S/A.TOP        seem-LK-3
       ‘My dog seems well (lit. good).’
A3. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN (CLOSED WORD CLASS),UNMARKED – there is a small group of adjectival roots which can function as adverbs andquantifiers (see §3.1.3). These are komo ‘new (recent)’ and aiyo ‘big (a lot)’. Similarly toother adjectives, they take classifiers to form ‘headless’ nominal modifiers, e.g. aiyo-ko (big-CLF.REP:DOG) ‘big (dog)’. Underived, they function as adverbs and quantifiers. This is
                                                                                                140
illustared in (3.34-35) (see also §3.3.1 on the quantifier aiyo ‘a lot’). They can be furthermodifier with the intensifier eo ‘very’.
(3.34) eo aiyo i-t-ePRED
       very a.lot exist-LK-3
       ‘There is a lot (of it!)’
(3.35) komo       rii-d-ePRED
       recently arrive-LK-3
       ‘(He) has just arrived.’
Interestingly, when they take the generic classifier -e obligatorily followed by the topicalnon-S/A subject marker -na, they can also occur in the adverbial position, as in (3.36).","[163, 164, 165]"

(11.27) is an example of a negative question with command-like meanings. A grandmotherasked her daughter if she did not have food with her. She knew however that her daughterbrought cassava with her (she was in the kitchen when her daughter was packing it into herbag). By asking the question, she was simply saying that she wanted some of her daughter’scassava.

        2sg-LOC    eat-FUT.E.NMLZ exist-NEG
        ‘You don’t have food?’ (meaning ‘please give me some food!’)
B. BARE NOUNS – this is a sort of directive one answers to promptly; it serves as a weakcommand. Bare nouns seem to be highly elliptical directives, with omitted verb. For instance,shouting dɨo-kaɨ! (tobacco-CLF:STEM) ‘cigarette’ when entering maloca at night, wanting tobe given a cigarette. The usual way is to ask dɨo-kai kue ine! (tobacco-CLF:STEM 1sg give)‘give me a cigarette!’.","[493, 494]"
"
11.2.3 Tag questionsMurui tag question are characterised by the presence of a special tag words erua meaning‘really’. Among younger speaker of Murui, the form ua ‘really’ seems to be usedinterchangeably but the form erua is nevertheless more frequently used as a tag word. 290 Bothtag words are added after a statement which has a normal declarative intonation. The tagsform separate intonation units, and have a sharply rising intonation. Murui tag questions aregenerally used in positive polar questions when a speaker predicts that the statement iscorrect and seeks agreement from the addressee. Examples of erua and ua are given in(11.40-41) (see also T2.24 and T2.27 in the Appendix).
(11.40) bi-mɨeVCS            [Pedro dofora-to     jito]VCC                         ↗↗e↘rua?
        this.CTS-CLF:PR.M Pedro first-CLF.REP:SON son                              see.really
        ‘This is Pedro’s first son, isn’t it?’(11.41) ieS           jarire      fui-t-ePRED    ↗↗u↘a?
             CONN     quick.ATT finish-LK-CLF:G really
             ‘It’s finished quickly, hasn’t it?’
The origin of erua is likely to be the nominalised eru-a (see-E.NMLZ) ‘seeing’ (cf. the verbero(de) ‘see’). However, the two tag words can also be used in contexts where ‘seeing’ is notinvolved: 291
(11.42) [ziyɨ-na       jazikɨ-mo      ñaɨ-a-na]O                  kaka-dɨ-oPRED erua?
        bird-N.S/A.TOP jungle -LOC speak-E.NMLZ-N.S/A.TOP hear-LK-2sg see.really
        ‘You have heard the bird talking in the forest, haven’t you?’
290
      Elsewhere in the language the free form ua is an intensifier (see §3.3.1). Erua does not have such a function.
291
      This is possibly a semantic extension of ‘seeing’.
                                                                                               477
Negative questions rarely occur with the tag words. When this happens however, there is nochange in their intonation patterns. The following example illustrates that the tag erua has thesame sharply rising intonation as the tag would have in any positive question:
(11.43) [Pedro nokae-do]INS jaai-ñe-dɨ-omoɨPRED ↗↗eru↘a?
        Pedro canoe-INS        go-NEG-LK-2pl         see.really
        ‘You did not go by Pedro’s canoe, didn’t you?’
The tag forms erua and ua can also stand on their own. It is common to use both forms tosustain conversations and let the speaker continue (see examples T2.15, T2.31, and T2.45,T2.51, T2.70 in the Appendix and §13.3.2 on the use of ua in discourse).","[501, 502]"
"
All types of negative questions can occur with either the standard negative or the negativeattributive markers. Positive interrogatives differ from the negative ones in their semantics.",[467]

In the text, vernacular data is given in italics. Examples are numbered according to the
Chapter they are in (e.g. example ‘(1.5)’ refers to Chapter 1, example 5). Examples have
three lines. The first line is orthographic and breaks up each word into morphemes. The
second line shows morpheme-level glosses. SMALL CAPS are used for grammatical glosses.
Proper names are reproduced throughout the glossing. The final line provides a free
translation into English. The free translations are as idiomatic as possible; parentheses
complement contextual meaning of the free translations. If an example is to be found in the
text in the Appendix, it is marked with ‘TextNumber.SentenceNumber’, as in (T3.3).
      In the text, verbs are given in a citation form, where the predicate marker (-dɨ/-tɨ) is
followed by the 3rd person pronominal subject marker -e. For instance, the verb ‘write’ is
presented as kue(te) ‘write’, where kue- is a verbal root. Punctuation depend on the pauses in
speaker’s speech after the sentence is considered to have been completed. Clauses and
sentences are not capitalized. When one word has several different meanings, the most
appropriate one is given in the gloss. ‘Headless’ nominal modifiers that are used as heads of
intransitive predicates are often shown in brackets to indicate non-verbal forms used
intransitively, e.g. [mare-ko]-d-e (good.ATT-CLF.REP.DOG-LK-3) ‘it’s a good (dog)’.
      The quotation marks placed around the term Witoto are done at the request of the
Murui, Mɨnɨka, Mɨka, and Nɨpode people. ‘Witoto’ subsumed these four separate groups. The
term Witotoan refers to the language family (that consists of ‘Witoto’, Ocaina, and Nonuya).
      Throughout the chapters, there are a few numbering gaps, as some examples were
eliminated in the final stage of the revision process.

The graphemes follow the already established writing conventions for Murui, Mɨka, Mɨnɨka,and Nɨpode. In this work, the majority of the phonetic symbols follow the conventions of theInternational Phonetic Alphabet. The ones that do not, are:

1 The Murui language and its speakersMurui, also known in literature as Búe, Uitoto, Witoto, and Huitoto, belongs to the Witotoanlanguage family, one of the smaller linguistic families in Amazonia, that consists of two otherlanguages spoken in the area, Ocaina (still spoken by about 90 people) and Nonuya (amoribund language). Murui is spoken by about 2,000 people that traditionally inhabited theregion of the Amazon Basin between the middle sections of the Caquetá and Putumayo riversin Colombia and their tributaries, the Igara-Paraná and Cara-Paraná rivers. Today, smallerMurui tribes live also ‘outside’ the Caquetá-Putumayo region. There is a mixed communityof Murui-Mɨnɨka people located in the Resguardo Indígena Tikuna-Uitoto (known as‘Kilómetro 11’) close to Leticia (Colombia). Some also inhabit areas along the Ampi-Yacúand Napo rivers in Peru (see e.g. Petersen de Piñeros and Patiño Rosselli (2000: 219)).","[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"Verbless clauses expressing attribution are negated in the same manner as any other types ofverbless clause. This is illustrated in (12.19).

        ‘That dog is not a good dog.’
E3. POSSESSION ‒ verbless clauses with possessive meanings obligatorily receive either thegenitive -ɨe, as in (12.20), or the connective ie that occurs following directly the R, and makesanaphoric reference to the R, as in (12.21) (see also §5.1 on the expression of possession).

VCC arguments of verbless clauses can take case marking to have benefactive meanings, as(12.22), where the VCC is marked with the topical non-S/A subject -na. Under negation, apossessive NP functions as a head of a negated intransitive predicate, as in (12.23):

        ‘That is not (for her) hers.’12.1.2 InterrogativeInterrogative clauses have a typical rising-falling intonation (§2.4) as well as specialproperties available to them (see the optionality of verbal marking for 3rd person in polarquestions in §11.2.2). Polar questions do not contain interrogative content words unlikecontent questions; only one constituent of an interrogative clause can be questioned. Questionwords (§3.3.4) can also be have indefinite reading; the value depends on the predicate’spolarity. There are also a special type of a tag, alternative, and exclamative questions(§11.2.3-5) which have certain phonological and morphological properties characteristic tothem (i.e. different intonation patterns, presence of a tag, and special kind of morphologicalelisions). Gestures, such as raised eyebrows, wide-open eyes, eye contact with the addressee,occasional lip pointing, generally accompany all kinds of interrogatives.","[513, 514]"
"Declarative, interrogative, and imperative are the most common sentence types (also referredto as a system of mood) that are used for expressing the main speech acts. Many languagesemploy specific structures for these: declarative mood is used for statements, imperative forcommands, and interrogative for questions (Dixon, 2012: 376):
                           SPEECH ACT        GRAMMATICAL CATEGORY
                           statement         declarative (or indicative)

                           question          interrogative
This chapter discusses Murui commands (§11.1) and questions (§11.2) (see also §12.1 onMurui sentence types). This is followed by a brief summary in §11.3.",[483]

       ‘Neither Katarina nor Maria came (lit. Kata with Maria never came).’
A constituent of a negated clause may bear additional stress. Additionally, the topical S/Aand non-S/A subject markers are present on a constituent that is in constrative focus. Toexpress meanings such as ‘it wasn’t the man we met, it was the spirit’ speakers say ‘we didn’tmeet THE MAN; we met THE SPIRIT’, as in (10.4) below (cf. jɨko=dɨ (dog=S/A.TOP) ‘dog’in example (6.10) in §6.2.1.1):
(10.4) ɨɨ-ma-naO                   bai-ñe-dɨ-kokoPRED taɨfe-naO   bai-tɨ-kokoPRED

(10.5) is an example of the nominalized clausal constituent ‘one who doesn’t talk’. Cases ofdouble negation within a sentence, such as in (10.5), are not too frequent.

In Murui, questions differ from declarative and imperative clauses in both their intonation aswell as structure (see §11.2). The structure of some type of questions is unusual in thatpredicate markers can be omitted for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural. Negative questionswith omitted predicate markers have different readings than their positive counterparts (see§10.2.2). Murui has a single negative imperative (prohibitive) form, the standard negativemarker -ñe followed by the marker -no (see §10.2.3). Many of grammatical categoriesavailable in positive clauses are available in the negative as well but there is some minordegree of paradigmatic asymmetry between positive and negative imperatives. For instance,the grammatical category of rapid action (used for immediate imperative meanings) cannot beexpressed in negative imperative. The language has two ‘privative’ markers -nino on nouns,and -nino and -ñeno on verbs and adjectives (on verbs, -ñeno has prohibitive meanings, see§10.2.3).","[456, 457]"
"      Negative questions without predicative marking are commonly expressed with verbs asheads of the predicate, as illustrated throughout examples (10.53-57). The omission of thepredicate markers on negated adjectives and nouns seems to be less common, but does occur.",[470]

The narratives frequently finish with a number of formulaic expressions containing theauditory demonstrative aki- ‘this/that (as heard)’ and akɨ ‘auditory there’ (see §3.3.3). Anumber of such formulaic expressions are given in (13.22) (see also T1.81 and T4.41 in theAppendix):

In conversations, the intensifier ua is conventionally used with the interrogative intonation, asa customary response to a question asking for confirmation. (13.34) comes from aconversation about fishing. When a woman said that her husband came back from fishing,another woman asked:

     Murui has a special speech-register-like intonation for talking in the jungle at night. It involves a similar
conversational and narration patterns but higher by at least half or double of the frequency of normal pitch. I
was told that this is to disguise people’s voices so that they would not be recognizable for evil spirits.

B2. RISING-FALLING INTONATION IN POLAR QUESTIONS - this intonation contour involves ahigh rising pitch (marked with ↗↗) that falls on the first syllable of the last word of a clauseand is followed by a fall, as in (2.10):

C. RISING INTONATION ‒ this is a special (non-canonical) kind of the intonation contourpattern in Murui. It is mainly used when calling from a distance, or during festivities (forinstance, to announce somebody’s arrival, or gifts acceptance, and it is a usual way to bringto an end traditional songs). 76 Calling from a distance can be considered a special speechregister, conditioned phonologically rather than lexically. A characteristic of this speech-register feature is a steep rise in pitch of the high central vowel ɨ that usually follows finalelements of a clause, as in (2.15-16) (see also §2.5.2 for more details on vowel change usedfor calling from a distance). Its duration can lasts up to a several seconds. The high openvowel ɨ is treated here as a prototypical vowel because it holds the syllable nuclear position.

Similar vowel centralization techniques have also been reported for other Amazonianlanguages spoken in the area, such as Tariana (Aikhenvald, 2003). 77
2.5      General phonological processes
In this section I will discuss a number of the general phonological phenomena associated witharticulatory processes in Murui which affect alternations of phonemes. They are divided into
76
     These are a customary way of finishing traditional songs. They seem to be fixed expressions that contain
many lexical elements from other varieties of ‘Witoto’, such as Mɨka or Nɨpode, which is suggestive of where
the Murui ‘acquired’ some of their traditional songs from.
77
     Vowel centralization used for calling from a distance is not uncommon. For instance, ‘call-at-distance’
messages are shouted out among the Nungon speakers of Papua and New Guinea (Sarvasy, 2014: 122-124,
669), and are marked by an alternation of the final vowel of an utterance.
                                                                                                                  98
those involving vowels (§2.5.1) and consonants (§2.5.2). Murui phonological processes occuron the boundaries between a root and a verbal suffix and between two verbal suffixes. Thereare some phonological processes that can occur on the boundaries between roots, suffixes,and enclitics.","[120, 121, 122, 123]"
"            Murui lacks an independent grammatical word ‘no’; negative answers are expressedby jɨɨ ‘yes, no’ followed by negated predicates instead (§10.3.1). 272 Murui has a number ofquestion words which can function as indefinites, such as ‘nobody/somebody’ and‘nothing/something’. Their positive and negative readings depend on the predicate’s polarity(see also jaka in (10.3) that can mean ‘always’ or ‘never’). The language doesn’t seem tohave inherently negative words. A few positive words however, such as mare ‘good,272
      Jɨɨ ‘agrees’ with predicate’s polarity and, depending on the context, can be translated as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
                                                                                                                 433
beautiful’, do not have dedicated negative counterparts; the only way to say ‘bad’ is to negatemare, as in maraiñede ‘bad (lit. not good)’. 273
10.2 Clausal negation
Expression of negation in Murui involves morphological processes of verbal affixation of thestandard negative -ñe and the negative attributive -ni used both in main and subordinateclauses. 274 There is no special negative construction type ‒ a negative clause is structurallythe same as the positive one, with the addition of -ñe or -ni. These markers have the same slotin the structure of a Murui predicate (see §7.1) and thus never co-occur. While the standardnegative -ñe marks negation of all kinds, the negative attributive denotes either ‘lack ofability’ (with verbs), ‘lack of property’ (with adjectives), and ‘lack of possession’ (withnouns). The negative attributive -ni is the ‘dedicated’ counterpart of the positive attributivemarker -re (meaning ‘ability’ with verbs, ‘property’ with adjectives, and ‘possession’ withnouns) (see Table 10.3 §10.1). In the speech of older speakers of Murui, the positiveattributive marker -re cannot be negated (the negative attributive is used instead). Someyounger speakers do however negate -re with the standard negative marker -ñe.","[457, 458]"
"The marker ua might be a reduced form of erua, cf. example (13.25). Ua and erua areinterchangeable in questions (but not elsewhere in the grammar). Ua can be further followedby the classifier -fue (CLF:STORY) as in uafue for ‘truth’.",[562]

"
10.3.2 Negative wordsThe interrogative content words buu ‘who’ and bu-e (Q1-CLF:G) ‘what’ that are used incontent questions (see §3.3.4 and §11.2) can have indefinite readings. If the sentence containsa negative predicate, their meaning is ‘nobody’ and ‘nothing’; if the predicate’s polarity is‘positive’, they mean ‘someone’ and ‘something’. Examples are given in (10.104-105). Thereference of buu ‘who’ is reserved only for human referents, bue ‘what’ refers to non-humanreferents.

E. VOWEL CENTRALIZATION AND CALLING FROM A DISTANCE TECHNIQUE ‒ statements,questions, and commands can be shouted out and used for calling from a distance. As such,they not only receive a special rising intonation (see §2.4 on the rising intonation contour),but also involve lengthening and vowel change of the final syllable in the clause, as in (2.28).",[127]

When meeting on the path in the forest, people greet each other by saying:(11.58) beno-na                       jaai~jai-kai-dɨ-o?PRED

In such situation one usually answers:(11.59) benoi 292-kai-dɨ-kuePRED
        go.here-INCP-LK-2sg
        ‘I am going through here.’
The following example is used when leaving as a kind of ‘goodbye’. A person always bidsfarewell in the same way, that is by saying (11.60):

        already go-LK-1sg
        ‘I go already.’
11.3 Summary
While the declarative is the formally and functionally unmarked sentence type in Murui; theimperative is formally and functionally marked. The interrogative is formally unmarked, butfunctionally marked. Murui imperatives are either marked with a suffix or they can also beexpressed by verbal roots without any marking. Murui can express commands without usingdedicated imperative forms. Command-like meanings involve statements and questions, barenouns, inflected verbs in non-future and future tense. All types of Murui command strategiesdiffer in their strength. Murui distinguishes between content, polar, tag, and alternativequestions. All of these have some phonological and morphological properties characteristic ofthem including different intonation patterns, presence of a tag and special kind ofmorphological elision.","[504, 505, 506]"
"            Murui interrogative content words fill an argument slot in content questions. Thereare two free interrogative forms: buu ‘who?’ and nɨɨ ‘which?’. With classifiers (that occur on133
      In fact -ne in an unproductive locational suffix, which occurs with the demonstrative bene ‘here’, the
postposition dɨne ‘at’ (see §3.3.6), the interrogative nɨne ‘where? (referring to an unspecific location)’, and the
number word da- ‘one, alone’, as in dane for ‘once (again, more)’.
134
      In the neighboring Kotiria (East Tucano) the O marker -re has also ablative meanings (Stenzel, 2013).
                                                                                              167
‘headless’ nominal modifiers), they have other meanings, for instance ‘when’ is expressed asnɨɨ-rui (Q2-CLF:DAY) ‘lit. which day?’. Unlike nɨɨ, the interrogative buu (and its derivations)can have indefinite meanings. Murui interrogative content words are summarized in Table 3.3below.","[191, 192]"

180
      Elsewhere in the grammar, the connective ie is used for purposes of clause linking and referent-tracking (see
§3.3.5). The connective ie is never fully coreferential in Murui (that is, it never agrees in classifier, number, and
gender with its referents). In other languages spoken in the area, such as Bora, the connective aane is always
coreferential (Seifart, 2010).
                                                                                                256
‘truly’ possesses the D; they are emphatic in nature. They are frequently used as answers forthe question bue (baie)? ‘what (is that)?’. Compare (5.87) and (5.90). (5.87) is a typicalverbless clause in Murui expressing identity; (5.87-90) are ‘possession’ verbless clauses withthe connective ie.

       Kata      mother CONN father
       ‘(This is) Kata’s mother’s father (lit. Kata’s mother HER father).’
In verbless clauses with the connective following the R, the R can be a noun or a ‘headless’nominal modifier, but never a 1st and 2nd person pronoun (as mentioned in §5.1.1.2, non-3rdperson pronouns cannot co-occur with ie), e.g. *oo ie jebe-gɨ (2sg CONN abdomen-
                                        rd

       ANA.SP-CLF:PR.M CONN         ANA.NSP-CLF:WATERY
       ‘(This is) his drink (something to drink).’
B. CONSTRUCTIONS WITH THE CONNECTIVE ie FOLLOWING THE R, AND THE D OMITTED ‒ inconstructions with the connective following the R, ie always refers anaphorically to the R, asillustrated in (5.92). The D is omitted from the NP; in verbless clauses expressing identity itcan occur as the VCS argument, as in (5.93). Such constructions are the most frequentanswers to the question buu ie baie? ‘whose is this?’.
                                                                                              257

       ‘This dog is my father’s (lit. this dog - of my father, belonging to my father)’
In the verbless clauses expressing identity, occasionally the VCS (that refers to the D) can beomitted when the referent is clear from the immediate context. Such omissions occurfrequently as answers to the question buu ie? ‘whose?’. This is shown in (5.94), where Ratapointed to a camera, asking to whom it belonged. The argument camara is not overtly stated.(5.95) shows the underlying VSC-VCC structure of (5.94):
(5.94) [Kata ie]R
       Kata CONN
       ‘(The camera) is Kata’s.’

       ‘The camera is Kata’s.’
5.1.4   On ‘possessibility’ of Murui nounsThe vast majority of nouns in the language are optionally possessed and take the possessivepronouns, or the possession is marked by juxtaposition of possessor and possessed. A fewnouns, such as fueo-tɨ-mɨe (learn-LK-CLF:PR.M) ‘student (lit. (male) who learns)’, never seemto be possessed. Elders prefer to say kue yofue-ga-mɨe (1sg teach-PASS-CLF:PR.M) ‘myapprentice (lit. (male) who I taught)’. This is similar with gɨbokɨ ‘type of beetle’ disliked bythe Murui. One can possibly say kue gɨbokɨ ‘my beetle’ but people normally would not saythis ‒ why would one want to own a beetle? See also Aikhenvald (2012: 163-169).","[280, 281, 282]"

      The major speech acts are conventionally referred to as ‘mood’ where statements are characterized by
declarative/indicative mood, commands correspond to imperative mood, and questions are referred to as
interrogative mood (Aikhenvald 2010).
                                                                                              483
12.1.1 DeclarativeThe most frequent clause type is the declarative (affirmative). This is the ‘default’(functionally unmarked) clause type in the language. Similary to the interrogative, thedeclarative clause is not marked with any separate morpheme. The declarative vs.interrogative distinction is made using a special intonation contour (see §2.4). The constituentorder of the declarative is usually of the AOV/SV type but it can also be determined bypragmatic factors (with O being postposed to the clause-final verb) (this is in contrast withdependent declarative clauses, where the constituent order appears to be rigid, being verb-final). In natural discourse, clauses with two overtly stated arguments, A and O, are rare (see§6.1-2). Declarative clauses in Murui are A. INTRANSITIVE CLAUSES, B. EXTENDEDINTRANSITIVE CLAUSES, C. TRANSITIVE CLAUSES, D. EXTENDED TRANSITIVE CLAUSES, and E.","[507, 508]"
"Grammatical categories of mood in Murui are not part of the non-spatial settingspecifications but they correlate to a certain degree. Depending on sentence type, there arefewer distinctions in expressing certain grammatical categories. For instance, evidentiality isnot expressed in commands, and it rarely occurs in questions. Also, clause types and negationcan affect expression of certain grammatical categories on the verb. An example of this areverbless clauses which cannot occur with any of the TAME markers (§12.1.1).",[347]

      The attention getting marker baa occurs also in the neigbouring Tucano (Ramirez, 1997: 341-342) (see also
§13.4). Tariana has the ‘urging’ particle ne to attract attention (Aikhenvald, p.c.).
                                                                                              543

         ‘Bah! When one goes with children, it is scary!’
Example (13.61) comes from a conversation between two women. Sandriela’s response toMonika’s question ‘Where did you wake up?’ is preceded by Sandriela’s rhetorical question‘Where’. She did not know where she woke up. This is followed by the attention getting baa,to further emphasize her not knowing the place.","[567, 568]"
"
B1. UNDERIVED ADVERBIAL DEMONSTRATIVES – these are monosyllabic bii ‘here’ and baa‘there’. Murui nominal demonstrative bound forms bi- ‘this’ and bai- ‘that’ discussed in Aabove share their forms with bii and baa. The underived adverbial demonstratives are rarelyused. The most common context of their occurrence are fixed ceremonial forms: upon giftingan object, it is customary to say either bii (understood as ‘here it is, take it’) or baa (for ‘thereis it, take it’); cf. with the question nɨɨ? ‘which, what are you giving me?’ in similar contexts,§3.3.4). Neither the adverbial demonstratives nor the interrogative nɨɨ take classifiers in such
                                                                                                164
situations. The adverbial bii and baa can also be used as interjections in discourse (see§13.4).","[188, 189]"

7.4   Summary
This chapter focused on the elements of the non-spatial setting in Murui. The verbal categoryof tense in Murui is manifested as a binary opposition between non-future and future. Thenon-future tense is the unmarked ‘default’ verb form. The language has an extensive array ofaspectual markers on the verb, which cover phase of activity, temporal extent, degree,frequency, and manner. With respect to the system of modality, verbal suffixes includeattitudinal modalities (speaker’s attitudes towards an event in terms of the desire,apprehension, and ability to perform an action), epistemic modalities (‘unconfirmed’ and‘confirmed certainty’ which cover speaker’s degree of confidence in the utterance); the

deontic modality is expressed by a future tense nominalizer. Murui has a simple system ofevidentiality with two choices available, ‘reported’ (formally marked) and ‘everything else’(unmarked). Murui has two distinct direction markers, the andative and the ventive. Acomplete list of Murui TAME markers, together with their semantics, is given in Table 7.3 in§7.2. Table 7.4 below illustrates their co-occurrences in the language.

8 Valency-changing mechanismsWhile the valency-reducing mechanisms signal demoting an argument – the erstwhileambitransitive and strictly transitive verbs become strictly intransitive, valency-increasingdevices indicate that an argument has been added. Murui has one type of valency-reducingmechanisms ‒ the passive (discussed in §8.1), and one valency-increasing mechanism ‒ thecausative and the double causative (§8.2). Murui reflexive and reciprocal constructions arenot valency-changing mechanisms (they maintain the clauses as transitive) but are included inthis chapter in section §8.3. The last section §8.4 offers a brief summary.","[394, 395, 396, 397]"

A. CLAUSES OF CONTRAST AND ADDITION ‒ the linker iadɨ is expressed by two main clauses ofwhich the second is introduced by iadɨ ‘but, although’ and occurs in the clause-initialposition. Iadɨ typically has a contrastive meaning, as in (12.26-28) (see also example T2.27,T2.37, T2.41, and T2.65). Occasionaly, iadɨ is interchangable with iadedɨ (a form of iadɨfollowed by the topical S/A subject marker =dɨ), as in (12.29).

Iadɨ is not always strictly contrastive. Its semantics appear to also cover such meanings like‘so, even so’. Example (12.30) shows overlap with cause and result, followed by a purposiveclause (marked with the future event nominalizer -ye).

Iadɨ is a multifunctional form that can be used within a single clause (independently of itbeing coordinated). This is shown (12.31); the meaning of (12.31) is that ofcounterexpectation.

B. CLAUSES OF DISJUNCTION - disjunction in Murui is encoded with the linker oo ‘or’ inalternative questions. 296 They are formed by a disjunction of two main clauses that share thesame subject (of which, the second clause is always negated; see also §11.2.4). The sameverb is obligatorily used in both clauses. The linker oo occurs in the clause-initial positionintroducing the second clause. For example:
(12.32) PedroS bi-t-ePRED     oo bi-ñe-d-e?PRED
        Pedro come-LK-3 or          come-NEG-LK-3
        ‘Did Pedro come? (lit. did Pedro come or didn’t (he) come?)’
296
      As discussed in §11.2.4, the linker oo does not appear to be a borrowing from Spanish (the Spanish linker o
for ‘or’).

12.3 Dependent clausesMurui distinguishes between subordinate clauses (§12.3.1), and complementation (§12.3.2)and relativization strategies (§12.3.3). Murui dependent clauses differ from main clauses interms of marking on verbs (verbal suffixes marking clausal dependency occur on a clause-final verbal predicate and are mutually exclusive) and their placement with respect to themain clause (in natural discourse, the AOV/SV constituent order in declarative clauses can beconditioned by pragmatic factors; in dependent clauses the constituent order appears to berigid, verb-final).","[515, 516, 517]"
"       The classifier -kɨno is commonly used as a conventionalized question when greetingsomebody, nɨ-ga-kɨno? (Q2-QUANT-CLF:NEWS) ‘what are the news (lit. how many news?)’. Anexample with -kɨno is presented in (4.60-61). (4.62) illustrates that such forms can furthertake plural number markers. Such uses, however, are not very common.

The morphological composition of the classifier -kɨno is not semantically transparent (that is,at least synchronically, -kɨno does not appear to contain a meaningful linear sequence of twomonosyllabic classifiers).",[238]
"        In discourse classifiers have anaphoric functions, and partially mark agreement (see§4.1). There is no agreement within an NP, and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers are markedwith the generic classifier -e, regardless of their semantics or number distinctions. This isillustrated in (4.15-18). In (4.15) the demonstrative bie ‘this’ modifies a noun with an animatereferent; in (4.16) the demonstrative bie ‘this’ modifies a noun that has an animate referentmarked with the collective -nɨaɨ; in (4.17) daje ‘one’ modifies a noun with an inanimatereferent; in the last example (4.18) baie ‘that’ modifiers a noun with an inanimate referentfollowed with the plural number -ɨaɨ:

4.2.2   ClassifiersThe multiple classifier system of Murui has a number of classifier types. Considering theirsemantics, functions and morphosyntactic loci that they occur in, the language distinguishesbetween the following classifier types:
        - PHYSICAL PROPERTY CLASSIFIERS ‒ referents are characterized in terms of their         physical properties (discussed in §4.2.2.1),        - ANIMATE CLASSIFIERS ‒ based on inherent sex-distinction male vs. female         distinction for humans and and sex differentiable animals (§4.2.2.2),        - ABSTRACT CLASSIFIERS ‒ denoting abstract concepts (§4.2.2.4),        - THE NEUTRAL CLASSIFIER -ra ‒ for unspecified referents (§4.2.2.5),        - REPEATERS ‒ partially repeated non-human nouns used for referents for which no         classifiers exist (§4.2.2.6).","[211, 212, 213]"
"       Verbless possessive constructions involve the R (and, often, the D) followed by theconnective ie that refers to the R anaphorically. Examples (5.3-4) are illustrative of this. (5.3)is verbless possessive construction with the R and D elements expressed in the clause. (5.4) is
                                                                                                 237
a verbless possessive construction with the omitted D. Verbless possessive constructions,such as (5.3), are frequently used as answers to the question bu-e bai-e? (Q1-CLF:G that.FSH-CLF:G) ‘what is this? (lit. what - that)’ while constructions such as in (5.4) are used as repliesto buu ie bai-e? (Q1 CONN that.FSH-CLF:G) ‘whose is this (lit. who his/hers - that)?’ (see§5.1.3.3).

      father spirit-CLF:INHER CONN
      ‘father’s spirit’s (belonging to the spirit of the father)’
Additionally, Murui has a construction which involves a morphological process of affixationwhere the genitive -ɨe is applied to pronouns. Such form function as arguments of verblessclauses; they can also head an intransitive predicate. The marking of the genitive isconditioned by the Nominal Hierarchy, where the 1st and 2nd person pronouns (singular, dual,and plural) in R function are marked with -ɨe, as in (5.5). 3rd person pronouns referring to theR are marked with the connective ie, as in (5.6). The genitive marker is discussed in §5.1.1.2.

Murui lacks a verb ‘have’. Stating relationship of possession in the language is achievedthrough predicative possessive constructions that involve markers on nouns and expressattribution or its lack (see §5.1.3.1), and the intransitive verb i(te) ‘exist’ where the R ismarked with the locative case (see §5.1.3.2). Another way to express possessive meaning isthrough a verbless clause marked with the connective ie, as illustrated in (5.6) above (see§5.1.3.3 for details).
                                                                                             238
        Although the vast majority of Murui nouns are optionally possessed, there are somewhich cannot be conceptualized as ‘ownable’. These are, among others, certain naturalphenomena. While some nouns (e.g. names of insects), tend not to occur in possessiveconstructions, others (such as kinship terms) are frequently possessed. A few nouns havedifferent readings when they occur in possessive constructions. The ‘possessibility’ of Muruinouns is the topic of §5.1.4.","[261, 262, 263]"
