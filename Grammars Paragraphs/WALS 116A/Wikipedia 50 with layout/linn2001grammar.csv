       The certainty of h a is more apparent when it functions as a support verb
for a main verb. This is the same as 'do' in English. The question in (69a) is
followed by an answer in (69b). This answer keeps the main verb 'run' but the
truth of the assertion is empahasized with iva 'does.' Another answer to this
question is in (69c). Here, the main verb is uns~atedand itla carries all the

3.1 Y ES/NOQUESTIONS: t E AND 'YA
        Yes/No questions are a type of question where the expected answer is
'yes' or 'no.' Yes/No questions are fonned with the irrealis mode particle ye,?
although )a can be used in the conditions described below. In addition to a
mode particle, Yes/No questions are signaled by rising intonation.
        Wagner (1934: 357) called the particle 'Ie a suffix and described the
placement as verb final, except for the attachment to the negative pre-clitic n2-.
This overlooks two importatn facts about Ye. First, it can be found at the end of
most complete phrases (noun phrase, postposition phrase, verb phrase). Second,
it has a propensity to be found in the second position (in the position after the
first phrase of a sentence). These facts make it a likely candidate for a clitic (or
bound word). However, there is evidence that the morpheme is an independent
word. First, 'Ze is not reduced phonologically but always bears the most
prominent stress of the utterance and is generally accompanied by high pitch.
Second, like other irrealis particles, 7e can be the verbalizer for verbal nouns.
       The Yes/No question marker 'le prefers to be in the second position, that
is, after the end of the first phrase. When there is an independent noun phrase,
the panicle can be in second positon (after the noun phrase) or after the verb
phrase. In these positions, the question marker has scope over the whole
sentence. If the particle comes after any other phrase, it changes the focus to
that phrase.
       Because the Yes/No question marker 'le must appear at the end of a
phrase, it can be used as a test to determine the boundaries of phrases
(constituents). The end of phrases often coincides with the end of words, and as
such, it has been helpful in determining suffixes from clitics. Therefore, most of
the patterns are given below to amply illustrate its placement. Although not all
the possible sentence patterns are given in the sections below. the rule that the
Yes/No question particle must be at the end of a complete phrase and its
preference for second position is illustrated in the common sentence patterns
below. These are followed by the exceptions.","[477, 478]"
"
Negative Phrase
       The sentential negative phrase is a pre-clitic on the verb phrase. The
Yes/No question panicle comes after the negative phrase, and so negative
cliticizes to the Yes/No question panicle.(18)   a. Nele k'ashz?                   'Aren't you eating?
          Nele k'zthle'2lre?             There's nothing wrong, is there?
          Nele 'yo'aa?                   'Don't you know?'       b. Nele k'ala h6k'6?              'He isn't working?/Is he not working?

             ?NEk'ala hGk'6 le?",[481]
"
       Information (or content) questions are questions in which the response
contains information beyond 'yes' or 'no.' Information questions contain a
question word (interrogative pronoun). The question words not only signal that
the clause is a question, but they indicate what kind of information is being
asked. With the exception of w i k 'what,'
                                   ~       all the question words are formed with
the question stem wa. The question word has rising pitch (indicated with a [;I),
but the end of question has falling intonation. With only a few exceptions, the
rising pitch is on the second syllable of the information word. The list of
question words is in (34).(34)   wan6                         'who'
       wiki                         'what'
       wahi                         'where'

       wac'i                        'which (round one)'
       The question word is generally found a t the beginning of the sentence, as
in (35a). However, when the question word refers to the actor of two-place verb,
it can also be immediately before the verb phrase (in situ), as in (35b).(35)   a. Wan6 neci h6b'6j65?

             'Who made this?'","[490, 491]"
"Although the Yes/No question particle is in second position, its placement with
the negative pre-clitic can also be due to the focus on the negative in negative
questions.",[481]
"The question 'What?' can have several intonation palterns depending on the
meaning.
   )   [wiks]         'What?'      (requesting information/ what is that?)
       [wikieL]       'What?'      (didn't understand or hear/ please repeat)
       [wik@]         'What?!'     (frightenedtsurprised)       The Yes/No Question particle always bears prominent stress and has the
highes~pitch in the utterance. This is true no matter where it attaches. Its
placement is discussed in Chapter 8, but (92a) provides examples of several of
its possible placements. The Yes/No Question particle can be left off. but this is
rare. When it is, rising intonation indicates the question, as in (92b).(95)   a. [k'anjinehd wesha gnthlel]        (contraction)

           'Do you want to go to the store?'","[124, 125]"
"       When Yes/No Questions are negative, the question post-clitic is almost
always attached to the negative pre-clitic.(62) a. Nele k'ala h6k'6?
        ne-1e k'ala hBk'6

        'Isn't he working?'",[503]
"          The expectation Iva also functions as a Yes/No question panicle. In
questions about the future using a verbal noun. the expectation >a is used instead
of Ye. As a question particle, )a generally precedes the noun.
(82)   a. Ya weyugone?                   'How about Friday?       b.   a 'agahe?                    'How about tomorrow?

          'How much money do you have?' (=with you right now)
       The question word war'e 'how much' can be suffixed with the general
location suffixes -he to create the question word war'ehe 'what time.' The answer
must be a specific time, or number. The question word wa'ehe is used for both
future time and past time. It does not have a past time variation *war'ele,like
wakhestahe 'when, in the future' and wakhstale 'when, in the past.' The example
in (56a) gives a typical war'ehe question and specific time response.","[499, 500]"
"    Although this is the probable structure, speakers treat the phrase as one word
    (indicating that 'le cliticized t~ ke). The question particle with the adverb kide
    'now' is treated here as a whole, and is glossed 'n0w.Q' for convenience.
           If kide is present, the Yes/No question prefers to attach to this adverb,
    with very few exceptions for extreme emphasis elsewhere in the question. The
Y
    Yes/No question panicle can be moved after the verb phrase, but speakers rarely
do this outside of elicited forms. The adverb and Yes/No particle keVde is
translated as 'yet' or 'now.' Examples are given in (26).(26)   a. Kelede khrenewi?

YeslNo Qlresrions with Only Intonation
       Yes/No questions can be performed without Ye. In these questions, the
rising intonation of the Yes/No question is exaggerated. In (33). the Yes/No
particle is used, but in (33b), the same question is given w i ~ hjust the rising
intonation. (33c) is another example of rising intonation.(33) a. Maxine 'le sio'y6thl'i?            [Maxine '16 sho'yq4'iPl

"       Unlike the other irrealis panicles, the Yes/ No question particle can be
used in all types of verbal constructions in order to ask a question. The
placement is like a clitic in that must come at the end of a complete phrase and

position). The placement of he Yes/No question particle 'le is detailed in
Chapter 8, Section 3.1.",[337]

Lareral, Nasals, and Glides (Resonants)
           Resonants consist of laterals, nasals, and glides. They are all voiced and
contrast by glottalization.                  -le                          'stative verbalizer'

particle 'le.

English bomowings. such as Walman' and 'amen' and in English personal names,

"
Noun Phrases
       When the question contains an independent noun phrase, 'le generally
comes at the end of the complete noun phrase. This is the second position.
However, speakers can (and do) put the Yes/No question marker after the verb
phrase when noun phrases are present, apparently without awkwardness and
without a change in focus.
       The examples in (19) show 7e after noun phrases which contain only one
noun with no modifiers.","[481, 482]"

Ya YeslNo Quesrions       The mode particle 'ya can also be used to ask Yes/No questions. The
precise nature of the question varies, but all reflect the future and tentative
nature of the copular use of 'ya. Wagner (1934: 357) gave a [-ya] as a suffix for
all Yes/No questions concerning the future, but this comprehensive usage does
not exist today. In dl instances, the question is short (noun) and the )a still
functions as the predicate. The position of >a is sentence initial. These Yes/No
questions are transtated as 'how about.'(31)   a. Ya weyugone?               'How about Friday?       b. 'Ya 'agahe?                'How about tomorrow?

"
       The panicle Y creates active verbs out of other pans of speech. Unlike
the nominalizer -Re, which makes nouns from verbs, the verbalizer '2 can make a
verb out of any part of speech. In the majority of cases, '2 creates an impersonal
sentence, or one that begins 'It is...' in English. The verbalizer 5 also has the
aspectual meaning of 'in progress' or temporary.' This is especially apparent
when contrasted with the stative verbalizer le.
       The verbalizer '2 is an independent panicle, which, when unstressed,
becomes attached to the stem (a bound word or post-clilic). Verbalizers are
usually part of the stem of the new word (derivation), not a separate word.
However, there is good evidence that the verbalizer 5 is not a suffix on the verb.
First. primary stress regularly falls on the last syllable of a stem. This includes
the nominalizer -ne. When the verbalizer 5 attaches to the end of the stem, it
does not bear primary stress. This indicates that it is not pan of the stem. The
second piece of evidence comes from the placement of the Yes/No Question
panicle 'kc. which comes after complete phrases. In the expression ' a h 2 'it is
that way' below, the Yes/No question panicle le comes between the stem and
the verbalizer.",[307]

Exceptional 'le Position: Tense and Mode
       The Yes/No question particle can never be placed after the tense or mode
phrase. The questions in (14) are repeated in (28) below, with the addition of
the ungrammatical placement word finally after a tense or mode phrase.(28)   a. S'eyo'aene & je?
          s'e-yo-'me                                      je

Changing 'ie Posirion: Focus       When Ye is not in the 2ndposition, it changes the focus of the question
from the whole sentence to the phrase that it is immediatley following. The
difference can be seen in the meeting questioned in (29) below. Tuesday is the
usual meeting day for this group. In (29a) the question is sentence-level scope.
The question particle comes after the verb phrase and the verb 'see each other' is
in question. However, in (29b) the verb is 'meet', but question does not focus on
whether or not they will meet. Rather, the question panicle comes after the
noun phrase 'Monday' because it is different from the usual. So, 'Monday' is the
focus of the question in (29b).

"       These verbalized question words are often used as the main clause in
specific information questions. This causes the content verb to be an embedded
clause. Thus, questions such as 'Where did you go?' or 'What is this called?' are
literally 'Where is it that you have been?' and 'How is it that you call this thing?'
Several examples of this construction are given in (38). In (38a) the content verb
'do' in the embedded clause is in the past tense. It is marked with12 'past
imperfective', but (38b) shows that the older past imperfective sh2 used for
embedded clauses is also possible. The example in (38c) also shows that the
content verb 'eat' is embedded since it has requires the begative pre-clitic Itcr-,
which also marks negative embedded clauses.

5.5 QUESTIONING:
              i!.e
       The Yes/No question particle is a n irrealis mode particle. Like the other
panicles, it can cause any stem to be read a s a verb. In this case, the truth of
the situation expressed in the verb is questioned. This function of 'le is clear in
the examples below, where Ye is the only verbalizing particle.(85)   a. Maxine 'le sio'yijthl'i?
          Maxine l e sio-'y6thl'i
          Maxine Q 3SG(~~.r).~oss-knife

Askirlg and Granting Favors: Te       Thc ability re is used to ask a favor of someone else, such as the informal
English 'Can you help me?' The favor can be asked in question form, such as
(50a) below with the Yes/No question particle 'le. Or they may simply be stated
as a need, as in (50b). Notice also in (50b) that the auxiliary verb follows the
verb in the dependent clause. The placement implies that the speaker can not
get the car started, so being able to get the car running is the favor rather than
simply going out to start it for her.(50)     a. Dithotoneci k'ap'ochu le nedzothla te?

"       Besides stress, the placement of the Yes/No question panicle /-'Is/ can be
used to determine suffixes on the verb from bound and independent panicles
following the verb. The Yes/No question particle must appear at the end of a
phrase. and it prefers to attach to the second phrase in a clause. See Chapter 8.
Section 3.1 for details of its placement. Since it attaches to the end of a
complete phrase. it is the most reliable test for the end of the verb phrase in
~uchee.' In the examples below. (2a) shows that the ability mode te .can' is
separate from the end of the verb: (2b) shows the same of the past imperfective
j2.

          'Did he ask you?' (women's speech)       The result is that the Euchee verb is not as synthetic as was previously
assumed. The verb stem has the pronominal and valence prefixes and only a
few aspect suffixes. All other aspect, tense, and mode are independent particles
following the verb.
       There are several problems in determining the linear order of tense,
global aspect and mode particles. First, they are at the end of utterances and
undergo phonological reductions. Some are dropped or are contracted with the
auxiliary stems; the vowels reduce to t'([A] or [a]) and voicing distinctions are
faint, causing distinctions between panicles to blur or be lost altogether without
more historical re-creation. Second, some of the panicles can be combined in
different orders to create subtle nuances in mood and aspect. Third. some mode
particles are resistant to placement tests (the Yes/ No question particle and the
past tense) due to their meanings. These are usually put with the other mode
particles until a more definitive placement is found. Finally, some of the
information is carried by mode in Euchee is elusive to speakers. They are best
understood in context, and so there needs to be more analysis of texts.","[291, 292]"
"    E.rcepriona1 Ye Position: Kede           A notable exception to the end of phrase rule is with the adverb kide
    how.' Whenever kide is used, the Yes/No question particle is placed between
    the two syllables, resulting in ke'lide. This apparent infixation is exceptional in
    all of Euchee morphology. However, the irrealis modes, including Ye. are
    verbalizers. And -de is the completed aspect suffix. Therefore, the likely form
    of ke'lede is not infixation. but the apsect suffixing to the verbal element 'le. This
    is illustrated below.    (25)   ke 'lede
           ke      le-de

"The verb go2 is derived from k l 'to accompany' and the verbalizer z . ~
' This order is a little odd for an A-P-V (SOV) language. One expects to find
the copula immediately following the verbal noun. This order is also inconsistent
with the rest of verbalization in the language. which is found after the verbalized
pan of speech.
- An alternative word for 'green, blue' is hifa. However, it does not seem to be
in widespread usage.
  Wagner (ca. 1935: 47) gives 'have' as kl 'to be with.' See Chapter 4, Section
3.3 for the stem uses of k5.

         This chapter describes how noun phrases, verb phrases (including the
verbals structures), and particles are put together to form longer utterances.
People do many things with language. We make statements concerning the
world around us (declarative sentences). We ask questions, and sometimes
command someone to do or not to do something. Each of these kinds of
utterances has one (or more) specific constructions. Statement, question, and
command forms can then be used for a variety of other functions. For example,
questions can be used to make requests or invitations. Statements can also show
empathy, expectation, or obligation. These functions are shown through the
mode particles and auxiliaries following verbs and are found in Chapter 5. The
first three sections of this chapter describes the construction (syntax) of utterance
types.
         In addition to types of utterances, an utterance may be simple or complex.
A simple sentence has one clause. A clause has one main verb which shows
agreement and may show tense, aspect and mode. Chapters 3 and 4 developed
the verb phrase with pronominal agreement. The inflected verb phrase is the
simplest complete clause in Euchee. A complex sentence has more than one
clause. The second clause may be embedded within the main clause, or the two
clauses may be joined one after the other with a coordinating conjunction.
         Sentences that are manipulated to focus the most important information in
the sentence are given in the section 7.
       This section describes the basic word order for Euchee. Although the
noun phrase is free to move into many places, the word order in daily usage is
fairly constant. Changes in word order generally create a change in focus and or
for topicalization.'
       The basic word order in a one-place declarative sentence is Actor (A) or
Patient (P), then Verb (V). In a two-place verb, the order is Actor (A) then
Patient (P), then Verb (V). These orders are illustrated below.
       Since the participants are marked on the verb, they can be left out of
sentences.(1)    a. 'Ahdgwa.
          'a-hd-gwa
          LOC-~PL(E).ACT-say
          They say'       b. Wethyaeyu.
             we-thyreyu
             3sG(~~).ACT-be.stingy
             They restricted it (water).' (JC)       c. Dzoshifa k'a se 'yushi.
          dzoshi-fa                k'a           se-'yushi
          sofki-CL/DET(STAND)      thing         ~sG(EF)-s~~
          'She's stirring up the sofki.'       d. Sedo'rene jt
          se-do-'me                               je
          ~SG(EF).PAT-~SG  . ACT/PLUS-ask         PAST
          'I asked her (already).'         1
        Because the information on the participants is marked on the verbs, it also
allows the noun phrases to move. Speakers can still undenand who is doing
what to whom because that pronominal prefixes make it clear, even if the Agent
and/or Patient is not in their usual places. In the sentence below 'Sissy loves
Sonny,' the pronominal agreement on the verb is sio-. This informs the hearer
that the actor is female, so 'Sissy' must be the actor (the person doing the loving,

"
       The affirmative answer hb 'yes' also functions as a mode panicle at the
end of an utterance."" Wagner (1934: 354) states that hb is an emphatic suffix.
The affirmative hb is emphatic in the sense that when ones affirms one
commitment to a future action or affirms one's belief that something is possible,
it is generally more emphatic than withodi such confirmation. However, the
basic conlent and function is one of affirming and confirming not emphasis.
                                  -
       The affirmative hb - [hJ] [hv], and sometimes [hC], is used to confirm
one's commitment to a future action. It is most common when offering to do
something, such as the example from (52) above. It is provided again here in
(95a). It is also used when giving permission, as in (95b).

"       Unlike the emphatic -:le, the particle -gd can not be used on verbs. It is
used only with adjectives. Because it is associates with adejctives, more
examples and discussion of -gi is in Chapter 7, Section 2.4
7. AUDITORY EVIDENCE:-Ke       Evidentials are markers which indicate the source of information for a
proposition. Euchee uses -ke to report an event that the speaker hears but does
not see. It is therefore an auditory eviden~ial.
       A typical use of the auditory -ke is shown in (89a). The sentence is an
assertion 'They're coming' and the evidential -ke gives the additional meaning of
'I hear them.' However, the verb cannot agree with the speaker. The same
meaning can be expressed with verb chkZ 'hear' in the main clause, as seen in
(89b). This time the speaker is the actor of 'I hear' and there is no evidential.(89)   a. 'Ahe 'ig6ke.                                 ['a he 'igq ke]

           'I hear them coming.' (women's speech)       The evidential -ke are normally not used in questions. However, the
Yes/No question in (90) is possible. However, the speaker is showing more
excitement or surprise that they are coming rather than needing information.
The position of the Yes/No question marker between the verb stem and the
auditory -kp shows the evidential is a clitic.
(90)   'Ahe 'igo 'leke?                        rahd 'ig3 like]

       here ~SG(E).PAT-COW Q-HEAR
       'Are they coming (you hear them?)' (women's speech)       Although it usually becomes a fully voiced /g/ today, the auditory -ke is
the same as the location suffix -ke, which means 'yonder' o r 'way over there.'
Like its locative meaning of 'far away,' the auditory -ke conveys the idea that the
action is so far away that it can only be heard and not seen, as in (91a-b). The
auditory -ke does not have to be used with all sound verbs, such a s 'blow' in
( 9 1 ~ ) but
          . can be attached to any non-sound verb to indicate that it was heard.","[339, 340]"
"       Thus, the location particles in Particle + Verb Constructions are not
prefixes. However, they can become cliticized. This occurs when some other
pan of the sentence is given prominent stress for emphasis or clarification. and
when the panicles are contracted, as seen in (90).(90)   a. ['a wegwaL]                                     Gwal]

Clitics
          Clitics are bound words. The word it binds to in the phrase or clause is
called its host. hust as affixes can be prefixes or suffixes, clitics can attach to
the beginning (pre-clitic) or the end (post-clitic) of a word. Euchee has both pre-
clitics and post-clitics. Unlike affixes, which are bound to a specific part of
speech, clitics attach to a constituent. either a phrase or clause. For example. the
noun classes always move to the end of the noun phrase, so they may appear
after a bare noun, or a quantifier, or an adejctive; they are not always attached
to the noun itself. Since clitics can attach to several different hosts, they are
more loose1y bound than affixes. In Euchee, all one-sy llable independent
particles are stressed. If they are not stressed, due to emphasis elsewhere. they
can become cliticized to a host. The difference between ciitics and independent
words. then, is mainly phonological.
          The Yes/No question particle 'le is an irrealis mode particle. It is always
an independent word. It is not phonologically reduced, but carries with it a
prominent stress. However, it has characteristics of a clause-level clitic. It
prefers to be after the first complete phrase in a clause, called a 'second position'
clitic. While Ye prefers the second position, it can be placed at the end of any
constituent in the clause. Because of this, it is a good test for constituency in
Euchee, Chapter 8, Section 3.1 Yes/No Questions for examples.
          Most of the independent particles can be several phrase-level clitics when
unstressed. These attach to the phrase which they modify, and are typified by
the noun class/determiner post-clitics, the piural particle, the tense particle. This
is similar to the English 'not,' which must be attached to a host when it is
phonologically reduced, as in 'doesn't.'
          Only the negative pre-clitic nP- - me- is always attached and can never be
an independent particle. The negative pre-clitic attaches to the besinning of
either the noun or the verb phrase, similar to the English 'I do not have any
urandchildren' and 'I have no grandchildren.'"" The evidence that they are bound
r'
and not free comes from the fact they follow the stress patterns of the verb and
noun. The negative pre-clitic bears secondary stress of the first syllable,
although they are often emphasized for pragmatic purposes. See Chapter 8.

"Postposition Phrases
       The Yes/No question particle can appear after a postposition phrase. This
can have very little change in scope, as shown in the (24a). However, in general
the 'le on a postposition particle emphasizes the exact placement, and thus
changes the scope from sentential to the location phrase.

"More on the active verbalizer of adjective stative verbs is found in Chapter 7.
Section 2.3.
        The verbalizer -1e attaches to nouns (weather, numerals, and color terms)
and adjectives to create a stative verb. The created state is permanent or
enduring.
        Like the active verbalizer -2,the stative verbalizer -1e is not stressed.
Therefore, it is treated as an independent particle which attaches to the stem.
However, unlike the active verbalizer 2, the stative verbalizer -1e is never a
stem. In addition, there is no instance where the Yes/No question particle comes
between the stem and -1e. Instead, the Yes/No question marker -?e is used in
place of the verbalizer -1e. There is no clear evidence. then. that the verbalizer
-1e is ever an independent particle.f
        The verbal adjectives and nouns with -le are permanent or enduring
states. In fact, they are so permanent that they are just barely verb-like. Verbs
can have tense, aspect. and mode. But because the verbal adjectives and nouns
with -1e are so static, they require the copula ka inserted before they can be put
into the past tense. or show other aspect and mode. Several examples are found
in Section 2.2 Past Imperfective, example (10) above, and a few more are siven
here.(32)    a. Wret'e wesale 'wa-ne.

"       When the question word asks for information beyond the actor or patient
roles, the question word stays immediately before the verb phrase, as in (36a). It

"Ability: Te Can'       The ability of the actor to complete the action in the verb may be due to
'internal' or 'external' forces. Internal force refers to the actor's physical abilities,
mental abilities, or willingness to help. External force refers to social conditions,
such as prior commitments or obligation to family and elders. The auxiliary verb
re 'able' is used for both kinds of ability.
       The examples give simple sentences which illustrate the basic use of re
'ability' in relationship to the main verb. In (35a) gives the ability 'can.' In (35b).
the Yes/No question particle comes between the auxiliary re and the verb. In

"       As can be seen, The actor or patient can be behind the verb. This is
ususally done to emphasize the one that is remaining in front of the verb. An
example is in (3a) where the speaker was emphasizing that the man in the

(3b), the speaker is focuing on whether or not William was visited, not that
Henry was the visiter. In (3c), the word order PAV is shown. That is because

"        2) If the question contains is comprised of only an inflected verb and that

panicle, then 'le comes immediately after the required khla noun phrase and
