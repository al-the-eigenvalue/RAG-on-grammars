The focused constituent most usually represents newinformation. The function of -hya can be clearly demonstrated in content questionsand answers to content questions; -hya is used in such clauses because there isalways a focused constituent which seeks or provides new information. It is alsogrammatical for content questions and answers to be marked with -hwa instead of -hya; -hwa is simply indifferent to — rather than negating — the fact that somethingis focused in the clause. Nevertheless, -hya is much more common with contentquestions, and answers to content questions are also nearly always marked with -hya.","[367, 368]"

We have seen that future declaratives are expressed by semi-realis verb forms(§6.2). Future interrogatives, however, must be in irrealis status. The futuretentative verb form is used for both content questions (question word questions) andpolarity questions (yes-no questions). The following are some examples of contentquestions in future tense.6-150. dani=hya=na            ga=na           po-ma-afu?          here=ABL=TOP where=ALL go:FUT-NEG:IR-2SG          ‘From here where will you go?’ (pi (pi-/ po-) ‘go’ class I; -afu class IB)6-151. nahombo kaha-ma-wa-a?          why        chop-NEG:IR-2SG-3FSG:O          ‘Why will you chop it down?’          (kahefi (kaha-) ‘chop standing things’ class IIB; -wa-a class IIB)6-152. nuŋgwi         bli-ma-ha-a?          how.many buy-NEG:IR-1SG-3FSG:O          ‘How many should I buy?’ (bli ‘buy’ class II; -ha class IIA, -a class IIB)                                              390

6.2.3   Functions of semi-realis verbs        Verbs in semi-realis status are statements which convey the speaker’sabsolute certainty that a proposition will hold in the future, and that the speaker iscommitted to the truth value of of the proposition. Semi-realis sentences cannot beused as questions; future tense questions are in irrealis mood (§6.3). The followingare a few examples of clauses with verbs in semi-realis status.",[390]

I leave this question unanswered; I adopt a theory-independent view that a core grammatical relation can be expressed by both a cross-reference suffix and an agreeing (pro)nominal.18 After all, the full interpretation of asemantic argument may sometimes need to be established by both a (pro)nominaland an agreeing person marker, even in a language like English which is said to onlyhave ‘grammatical agreement’ only, e.g. in a sentence like the fish eat-Ø everythingI drop into the tank. In Menggwa Dla, there are also cases where the fullinterpretation of a semantic argument can only be established by both a (pro)nominaland a cross-reference suffixes. In the following example, the citation pronoun si(§4.6.1) has a more specific person feature than the cross-reference suffix -efi (classIB; §5.2.1), but the cross-reference suffix -efi carries number and gender featureswhich the pronoun si lacks. Together the pronoun and the cross-reference suffix
18
  Nonetheless, this ‘theory-independent’ view is in a lot of ways akin to the position taken by Barlow
(1992) and Pollard & Sag (1988). For Barlow, agreement is not a morphosyntactic notion where
morphosyntactic features have to be matched between two linguistic expressions, nor a semantic
notion where certain semantic properties of one or a group of referents are expressed; agreement is
a discourse notion where both the agreement expression and the agreed reference contribute to the
identification and characterisation of the discourse referents.",[317]

These post-verbal nominals are most usually used to introducenew information which is not important to the discourse. These post-verbalexpressions belong to the clause of the preceding verb syntactically as they are notseparated with the preceding verb by a pause, and no resumptive elements are usedbefore the verb. (However, see §2.4.2 on intonation patterns of post-verbalnominals.) The following are examples of post-verbal nominals in subordinate (§7.1)and chain clauses (§7.2).","[342, 343]"

3.2.9   Interjections, greeting phrases and miscellaneous would classes        Interjections are words which are semantically not related to the rest of theutterance. All of the following words except hya can form utterances on their own.        a              ‘ah’        o              ‘oh’        wu             ‘oh’        hya            INTJ        yambi          ‘OK’ (example 3-160 below)        ai             ‘ai!’ (exclamation of surprise/ accidents/ forgetfulness)        ini            ‘yes’        awe            ‘no’        The interjection a ‘ah’ can be used utterance initially (example 3-144 below)or medially (example 3-75 above), o ‘oh’ is used utterance-initially (example 3-102above), and wu ‘oh’ is used utterance-medially (example 3-145 below).3-144. a      yanu.        ah enough        ‘Ah, (that is) enough.’ (N)

       Other than forming utterances on their own, the words ini ‘yes’ and awe ‘no’can also be followed by gwa ‘but’ (§3.2.6), the exclamatory particle ke or thecautionary particle we (see below)). The word ini ‘yes’ is used to indicateagreement or existence (ini ‘yes’ is used in agreement with a negatively-polarisedquestion), whereas awe ‘no’ is used to indicate non-agreement or non-existence (inexample 3-151 below, awe ‘no’ signifies non-existence rather than non-agreement toa statement raised by someone).3-150. “ga        po-l-afa?”                “ini, (ga       po-l-aha.)”       “NEG:SMR go:FUT-LIG-2SG”             “yes (NEG:SMR go:FUT-LIG-1SG)”       “You will not go?” “Yes, (I will not go.)”3-151. awe, munika hof-ehye-mbi.       no    nothing come-1DU-PRES       ‘No, we are coming back with nothing.’ (N)       In addition, awe ‘no’ can also be used in an independent clause as a predicatemeaning ‘be not’. Unlike verbs, the predicate awe is not inflected, and unlike nouns,awe cannot be followed by a copula.3-152. awe, ai=na dani=hya awe.       no    3=TOP here=ABL be.not       ‘No, s/he is not from here.’

Thefollowing example shows that hwambo can take an object argument. The phraseimbumamo waplumbi ekwahya is a zero-headed relative clause (§7.1.1.3): -hya isthe only past tense suffix available to relative clauses, and the only mbo morphwhich can follow -hya is the object case clitic =mbo (§4.5.2).283-154. [imbumamo waplu=mbi                ek-wa-hya]=mbo              hwambo        [three          bucket=PROP exist-3FSG-PAST]=OBJ be.the.case        pi-Ø-a-Ø,        go-CR-1SG-DEP        ‘With there being three buckets I go, and…’ (B)The following is another example of hwambo; the object case clitic =mbo is notobligatorily used in Menggwa Dla (§4.5.1).","[193, 194, 195, 196]"

"       There is no affix marking positive irrealis specifically. The positive irrealisverb forms have the following morphological structure (the prohibitive mood verbsare never in positive polarity):       FINITE VERB STEM — CROSS REF SUFFIX(ES) — TM SUFFIX
       Formally, the negative irrealis verbs differ from the positive irrealis verbs byhaving an extra negative irrealis affix which is affixed to the verb stem. Thenegative realis affix has the form of ma-, -ma, -me or -m. The negative realis affixis always ma- when affixed to non-finite verb stems (§5.1.1). For finite verb stems,the regular allomorphy of the negative irrealis affix is as follows:   •   -ma is suffixed to class IIB, class II or class III verb stems.   •   ma- is prefixed to consonant ending class I or class IH verb stems;   •   -me is suffixed to vowel ending class I verb stems, except that when the       following class IB cross-reference suffix begins with a, the negative irrealis       suffix becomes -m.",[393]

4.5.6   Topic clitic        The topic clitic =na marks a (pro)nominal as a topic expression. Topicexpressions are placed at the beginning of a clause, except when they are precededby a locative word (§3.2.7), temporal word (§3.2.8; example 4-136 below), orconjunction (§3.2.6; example 4-145 below), in which case the topic expressionwould follow these constituents immediately (also see below for clauses with twotopic expressions). Alternatively, a topic phrase may be not clause-initial because itis preceded by another topic phrase (see towards the end of this §4.5.6). Topicexpressions are most usually also the grammatical subject of the clause; subjects arezero case-marked in Menggwa Dla (§4.5.1; 5.3.1), and the topic clitic =na isattached directly at the end of the topic expressions. The following are examples oftopic expressions are also the subject of the clause.4-133. wali=na ga           ke-o?        pig=TOP where COP:where-3FSG        ‘Where is the pig?’

The clause-initial position is also not‘reserved’ for topic expressions. For instance, a topic phrase can be preceded by alocative/ temporal word as in example 4-136 above. Focused expressions, e.g.interrogative words (§3.2.3), can also be in clause-initial position, as shown in theexample below. As expected, the topic clitic =na cannot be attached to questionwords, as question words are always focused and cannot be topicalised. In theexample below, =na is an allative case clitic (§4.5.3) and not a topic clitic. Thiscan be established by the fact that allative case clitic can freely alternate between=na and =nambo, whereas the topic clitic has only one form: =na.17
17
  The topic clitic is not homophonous with the allative case clitic in Dla proper and Anggor. In Dla
proper the topic clitic is =nya and the allative clitic is =na(mbo). In Anggor, the topic clitic is =ana and
the allative clitic is =na(mbo) (Litteral 1980: 79-80).","[250, 251, 252]"

Reference disambiguation is basically not needed whenone of the subject suffixes is first or second person, or when the gender features areconflicting. In the examples below, the person-number-gender features of thesubject cross-reference suffixes already indicate the coreference (1SG and 1SG in                                           466

The primary function of canonical SR systems is theindication of discourse participant continuity versus discontinuity, i.e. a CR markerindicates that the ‘salient’ participant — the SR pivot — will continue to beforegrounded in a following clause, a DR marker indicates that the ‘salient’ will notbe foregrounded in a following clause; see de Sousa (2005, in press) on this.","[480, 481]"

6.1.3   Negative realis verb boke and boka        A negative realis independent clause is formed by the lexical verb in its non-finite form (§5.1.1) followed by a negative realis verb boke (class I) or boka (classII). Whether boke or boka is used depends on the verb class membership (§5.2) ofthe lexical verb: for class I, IH and IIB lexical verbs, boke (class I) is used; for classII and III lexical verbs, boka (class II) is used. Class IH, IIB and III lexical verbshave mismatching classes of cross-reference suffixes between positive and negativerealis verb forms: in positive realis, the finite lexical verb stem itself controls theclass membership of the cross-reference suffixes; in negative realis, it is the negativerealis verb boke (class I) or boka (class II) which controls the membership of thecross-reference suffixes. The following table summarises the class of cross-reference suffix used in positive realis verb form versus negative realis verb form.","[370, 371]"

6.2    Semi-
       Semi-realis status       Semi-realis status encompasses only one tense-mood category — futuredeclarative (other future categories are irrealis; §6.3). Future declarative verbs ofpositive and negative polarities have markedly different morphological forms:positive semi-realis verbs are characterised by a serialised ‘positive semi-realis verb’
                                          366
samby (class I) (§6.2.1), whereas negative semi-realis verbs have a negative semi-realis particle ga (§6.2.2). Finite verb stems are used for semi-realis verb forms(§5.1.1), and if the lexical verb lexeme makes a distinction between future versusnon-future finite verb stems (§5.1.2), the future form must be used. The form of thepositive semi-realis verb varies greatly depending on the person-number-genderfeatures of the subject, and it is difficult to give a general morphological template ofpositive semi-realis verbs. In some cases the positive semi-realis verb forms aseparate phonological word from the lexical verb, and in other cases the positivesemi-realis verb forms a phonological word together with the lexical verb (see§6.2.1). On the other hand, negative semi-realis verbs are morphologically simple incomparison. Negative semi-realis verb forms begin with a negative semi-realisparticle ga and then followed by a (future) finite verb stem (§5.1.1-2) together withits cross-reference suffix(es). The cross-reference suffixes used in negative semi-realis verb forms are always class A suffixes (§5.2).

Positive realis and positive irrealis are indicated by zero morphs (but the tense-aspect-mood affixes for positive realis and positive irrealis moods are mutuallyexclusive); negative realis (§6.1.3) is conveyd by negative realis verb boke (class I)or -boka (class II); positive semi-realis (§6.2.1) is conveyd by the positive semi-realis verb samby or its bound form -mby/ -mb; negative-semi-realis (§6.2.2) isconveyd by a particle ga; and negative-irrealis (§6.3) is conveyd by an affix ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m.,[350]
"       The negative form of a DR chain verb is formed by serialising a negative verbboke (class I) or boka (class II) in DR chain verb form to a non-finite form of thelexical verb; class I, IH and IIB lexical verbs take boke (which takes class I cross-reference suffixes), whereas class II and III lexical verbs take boka (which takesclass II cross-reference suffixes). This is formally the same as the negative realisverb boke/ boka used in independent clauses (§5.1.3). Nevertheless, the chain clausenegative verb boke/ boka does not indicate status, unlike the independent clausenegative realis verb boke/ boka which indicates realis status. The following areexamples of positive CR chain verbs, positive DR chain verbs and negative DR chainverbs in different verb classes.

"       Negative non-future copulas and the future interrogative copulas have thesame forms (e.g. both have the non-finite form me).

Negative realis verbs are formed with the lexical verb in its non-finite form plus afollowing negative realis verb boke (class I) or boka (class II). The non-finite verbstem (§5.1.1) of the lexical verb and the negative realis verb boke/ boka are separatephonological words.

One salient feature is that most realis tense-aspect suffixes havecase clitic counterparts; it is most likely that these realis tense-aspect weregrammaticalised from the case clitics. Cross-linguistically it is not uncommon tohave tense-aspect-mood markers grammaticalised from case markings (e.g. Blake2001:180-131). One transparent example is from Kalaw Lagaw Ya (a dialect of theWestern Torres Strait language) where pratically the whole set of case suffixes arealso used on verbs to indicate tense or asepct (Kennedy 1984). Aikhenvald (2005)mentions that in Manambu (a Ndu language spoken in East Sepik Province in PapuaNew Guinea) and a wide range of other languages in her survey that case markersare often used with dependent clauses (often at the edge of the clause) to indicatevarious dependent relationships. These dependent clauses may be reanalysed asindependent clauses (‘desubordination’), and the case markers may be reanalysed asverbal tense-aspect-mood affixes. This is also likely the path of grammaticalisationof most of the realis tense-aspect suffixes in Menggwa Dla (except -hwa; see below);it is likely that the relative clauses (§7.1.1) were reanalysed as independent clauses,maybe through a stage of ‘obligatory’ cleft constructions. Amongst the four realistense-aspect suffixes (see table 6.4 below), -mbi, -hi and -hya are the ones which canbe used on relative clause verbs (§7.1.1); these are also the ones which have
                                           339
corresponding case clitic forms. The remaining past tense suffix -hwa cannot beused on any dependent verbs, and -hwa is also the only realise tense-aspect suffixwhich does not have a corresponding case clitic form. The following table lists therealis suffixes and the corresponding case clitics.","[352, 353, 354]"

Correspondingly, past tense and future tenseconvey non-immediate past time and non-immediate future time respectively. If theprogression of time is represented by a horizontal line running from left to right, andthe time of utterance by an × on the horizontal time line, this is how the tenses inMenggwa Dla dissect the time line:

7.1.2.1          Realis -hwani ‘when’ clauses          A realis -hwani verb has a (non-future) finite verb stem (§5.1.1-2), subset Across-reference suffix(es) (§5.2), and a -hwani ‘when’ suffix at the end. With realis-hwani clauses, the situation is known by the speaker as having occurred (positivepolarity) or not occurred (negative polarity), or habitually occurring (positive) orhabitually not occurring (negative), and the situation of the matrix clause beginsafter the inchoation point of the situation of the -hwani clause. The use ofsubordinate realis -hwani clauses is rather rare, for that sequential meaning is mostlyconveyed by chain clauses (§7.2). A realis -hwani clause is used as the final clauseof a non-finite clause chain or when it is followed by non-finite chain clauses (andnon-finite chain clauses themselves are rather rare; §7.3.1). In a non-finite chainclause, the subject must be coreferential with the subject of the following clause inthe clause chain. On the other hand, the subject of a -hwani clause must be disjoint-referential with the subject of its matrix clause. In effect, a non-finite chain verband a realis -hwani verb is the coreferential (CR) and disjoint-referential (DR) verbforms — respectively — of a switch-reference (SR) system. Nevertheless, this non-finite/ -hwani SR system is used much less often than the chain clause SR system.","[448, 449]"
