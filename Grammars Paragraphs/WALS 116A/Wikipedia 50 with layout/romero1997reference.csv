  11.1. Yes/no questions
  Warao marks yes/no questions with the sentence—final verb
suffix —ra ’INTERROG’ in the absence of constituent order
change  from declarative. Yes/no questions are      normally
neutral; i.e.,
         l .e.  their marker and arrangement do not lead to
                              22
negative or Iaffirmative answers. For example:  (42) tama•—te —a   osibu    ,yaba —n —a  —e   —ra
       this, LOC LOC morokoto Fish sg PUNC PAST INTERRQG
                     (kind of
    i' ,             Fish)
   . , ‘Did'you Fish any morocotos (in) around here?’
    (42) m a y 1 be equally answered negatively or aFFirmatively
depending Upon the results aF the action or the judgement oF
t h e ‘actor. However, Further modiFication brought about by the
negative marker -naka 'NEG' may signal a leading question, as
shown ,in ,(43) >
  (43) hi-      rima.  naa -naka ta -te      -ra
      1 2sg.PDS Father come NEG AUX NGN-PAST INTERROB
    1   (lit.) ’Doesn’t your Father come?’, or
    '   ’Your-Father doesn’t come, does he?’
  (435 expresses the speaker's doubt about the attendance oF
that particular Father,   which suggests that the expected
answer is,negative.","[29, 30]"
"  Interestingly, short answers to yes/no questions in Warao
exhibit a. peculiar phonology:    they are often more like
paralinguistic utterances than like ordinary morphemes, for
instance, affirmative uh—hunh and negative unh-uhn. which may
be furnished as answers in the language. These expressions are
nasalised since they must flow out through the nose given
total closure at lip level.",[34]
"
  To question constituents within postpositional phrases, the
corresponding head nouns must be replaced by the proper
interrogative pronoun. The following pair illustrate the case:
  (48) a. atono     kaika oka naru —ki —tia
          Antonio   with we go      INT HAB
          (Anthony)
          'We are going with Anthony as usual'
                                 25
           b. sina kaika ako naru -ki -tia -ra
              who with we ga       INT HAB INTERROG
              'With whom are we going as usual?'
  (4 9 )   a. tai a wahibaka wanari —a —e
              he of canoe     sink    PUNC PAST
              (lit.) 'The canoe of he sank’
           b. sina a wahibaka wanari -a    —e   —ra
              who of canoe       sink  PUNC PAST INTERROS
              (lit.) 'The canoe of whom sank?', or
              'Itlhose canoe sank'  In the absence of interrogative pronouns to question about
place,   time,   quantity or amount, etc.,      (Warao   lacks
interrogatives with where, when, how many connotation), the
language uses sina 'who' and kasikaha 'what' as interrogative
determiners which modify nouns referring to location, time,
currency, price, etc., giving the idea of what place?. what
day?, what Quantity?, who individual?, etc. Some examples are
shown in (50)
  (50) a. kasikaha ama a hokahi        eku
          what     moment of sun       in(side)
                   (to)day             naru —te      —ra
             go    NON-PAST INTERR06
             (lit.) 'In what day do/will you go?', or
             'When da/will you leave?'
           b. sina warao -tuma yaota rubohi —te      -ra
              who Warao PL      work hurry   NON—PAST INTERROG
              'What Warao da/will hurry the work?’
  11.3. Echo questions  Warao echo questions require no special answer words. Simple
affirmative or negative responses to questions may involve
repeating the verb of the question, with or without additional
material:       YES/NO ECHO QUESTION
  (51) A: ama a hokahi ata oka yaota -te
          (to)day      in we work    NON—PAST
          'We are work today'           B: (ama a hokahi ata) yatu yaota -te      -ra
               today         in    you work  NON-PAST INTERROG
              'Do you work today?'","[32, 33]"
"
                                  26
  i:   A:   (ama a hokolii ata ’oka) yaota -te
  ‘1         1today          in we    work   NON-PAST
  1         ’ (We)'work today'f i    QUESTION-WORD ECHO QUESTION
  (52) A: domu ine hat -a     -e
           bird I   spear PUNC PAST
           'I speared a bird'       B; kasikaha —ra       (yatu hat —a  —e   )
  1       what      INTERROG you spear PUNC PAST
          'What (did you spear?)’       C: domu (ine hat —a —e       )
          bird I     spear PUNC PAST
  i     - ' (I speared) a bird'
  In Warao, the repeating of the verb in a yes/no echo
question is obligatory, such as it is shown in     (51). This
response may be preceded by the affirmative words nome 'yes'
and tuatane 'it is so', or the negative tuatane ana 'it is not
so' .","[33, 34]"
"
  However, —ra ’INTERROG’ cannot be directly attached after
the negation marker -naka 'NEG' as well as same mood markers
that break the verbal inflection string. In those cases, —ra
'INTERROG'  is added to the auxiliary ta 'AUX', which is a
locus for tense,    aspect and questioning, under specific
conditions. An example is presented in (41) below
  (41) naba muhoko tatuma    waba -komoni
       river side of they    die  NEG.POT        t   —a ■ —e   -ra
        AUX PUNC PAST INTERROG
        'Couldn’t they die on that side of the river?’
  -ra   'INTERROG'   must be present     in   those   contexts
corresponding to the following two types of questions:     (i)
yes/no questions, and (ii) question—word questions. Rising
intonation is associated with questioning. This matter has not
been sufficiently explored by the author though.",[29]
"
  There is an alternative mechanism to question constituents
within embedded clauses in complex sentences. This implies the
use ;of sina 'who' and/or kasi kaha ’what’ preceding the
embedded clause provided that the main clause is left out, in
a treatment identical with echo questions. Such a treatment is
by thejWay:of illustration applied to (46), as shown in (47)  (47) a. sina —ra       hi      ribu nona —naka —kore 0
          who   INTERROG 2sg.F'OS say do     NEG   COND
          ’If who do not do as he (the chief) says?’
          b. kasikaha —ra       yatu nona —naka —kore
             what      INTERROG,you do     NEG   COND
             ’If you do not do what?’  s   ""
  Since the interrogative marker —ra ’INTERROG' only attaches
to main verbs, which in this particular context is absent, the
question-word themselves suffix them. This is a commonplace
procedure in Warao, more likely to take place in copulative
sentences in which the copula may be omitted, such as
exemplified in (44f).",[32]
"          15. 'FOCUS -(Romero—Figueroa, 1985)      Warao,. permits variations,, from the basic OS9 order. Far
    example, S is moved to initial position in question—word
    questioning: 1      (66)    •siha tama — ha   ribu —te •      —ra
             ""■< who this NOM, say   ;NON—PAST INTERROB
      i       ;] ’Who says that?’        i      t
                                      33
                                                              I  The sentence initial occurrence of S in        (66) may be
accounted -for by an obligatory rule of WH—QUESTION MOVEMENT.
In (66), the -focal point has been fronted. The concept focal
point or focus here is somewhat similar to that of new
information:  it applies to what is requested through the
question rather than to what is already common knowledge or
pressuposed. Thus, the fronting of the focus is a dominant
device far question formation in Warao. Since all major
sentence constituents may be questioned in the language, when
WH-movement operates upon sentences having multiple objects,
i.e., sentences containing direct objects plus        indirect
objects   with or without obliques, or sentences containing
several oblique objects, such movements have the effect of
reversing the position of some of them respecting the others.
Far instance, the questioning of the direct object of i a
sentence such as in (67)
  (67) buare       aisiko ibure    hua    n      -a   -e
       machete     with   wild pig Juan   kill    PUNC PAST
       (big knife)                 (John)
       'John killed a wild pig with a machete'
  implies the fronting of such a direct abject which makes the
oblique appear after the direct object in the interrogative
farm of the sentence:
  (6B) kasikaha buare       aisiko hua
       what     machete     with   Juan
                (big knife)         (John)       n   —a   —e   —ra
       kill PUNC PAST INTERROG
       'What did John kill with the machete?'","[40, 41]"

typoiogicaliy-oriented referente grammar of the language, and
it.:also describes, on the grounds of sociolinguistic data, the
speech styles observed in.Warao. I have striven to make the
grammar j a s ’ .general as possible, covering as many topics as
possible; , in. a f ramework that is understandable and usable by
linguists of all theoretical persuasions. Additionally, I have
endeavoured           to  depict styles by    considering    language
structures           that  correlate with spatial,    temporal    and
referenbialtcontent factors, as well as social factors defined

features of* Warao.          In the remaining part, consisting of
SECTION FIVE, I describe speech acts, participants roles and
styles detected in the language. For the purposes of handling
the contents, all throughout this investigation, SECTIONS have

  11,2. Question-word questions
  Information    questions   are Formed with    the    use   of
sentence-initial interrogative pronouns co-occurring with the
sentence   Final    interrogative  marker   -ra     ’INTERROG’.
Interrogative pronouns are obligatorily sentence—initial     in
Warao questions.",[30]

  In cases of elliptical answers to yes/no questions, such as
in (75), any constituent other than the verb may be left out.
For question-word questions (and echo questions as well), any
constituent may be elided.  (iv) Copulative sentences:  The copula is omitted very frequently. It seems that,     in
Warao, the copula is the LOCUS for past tense. Non—past tense
is not marked in the copula. The copula in this language is a
sort of semantically—empty dummy verb. Copulative sentences,
temporarily unmarked simply do not need the dummy carrier:  (77) a. dims   a kabesekuhu     irida    O

postposition aisia   'by' as a trace, which makes eminently
clear that a doer exist, even when it remains unspecified.
  (vi) Possessive phrases:
  In Warao, a-possessive noun phrases may be reduced by
eliding the possessor, with retention of the postposition
                                                                  ml u
'of'. Elliptical a-possessives take place under anaphori
correspondences, depending upon who the speakers are and their
roles in the events being narrated:  (79) a. tai a nibora ribu —n —a    —e

  17. ANAPHORA
  The presence of full noun phrases is generally interpreted
as a signal of pragmatically—marked contexts. Such items often
introduce new information in discourse or clarify referents
when sufficient ambiguity has arisen in a piece of speech.. For
Warao, this assertion seems to be rather valid because -full;
noun phrases have a low rate of occurrence in speech,! as
compared, far instance, with free and bound pronouns, which'
are primary means of referring to participants in discourse.
Free and bound pronouns couple with contextual     information
that helps to identify participants,       allowing a    proper
development of the speech sequences and favoring adequate!,
interpretation of the messages:                            t

participants in any syntactic role can be questioned.      For
example, (44a) and (44e) question subjects. (44b) questionsan
indirect   object and    (44c) questions an oblique.     (44d)
questions a direct object. (44f) and       (44g) question the
complement of the copula. Even, some elemets of a complex
quotative sentence may be questioned. For example, (6b) cited
above makes possible questions such as those in (45)  (45) a. sina tira wab —a  —e   tatuma

clause constituent by using question—words appears in the
Collected data. In addition to that fact, all the hypothetical
examples 'presented    to the informants      were  considered
ungrammatical.1  It is likely that the fronting of         the
questioned1constituent inherent to question-words brings about
syntactic complications that act as deterrant. Quotatives seem
to escape this restriction because the embedded clause, i.e.
the quote, precedes the entire main clause, which makes the
former behave as any initial object that needs not be further
moved from;its original position.","[30, 31, 32]"

  11.   QUESTIONS
  Questioning in Uarao involves the obligatory suffixing of
the verbal   interrogative marker —ra 'INTERROG' . This is •- a
closing suffix within any chain Qf inflectional morphemes
attached to any main verb (verbs in embedded clauses do not
question mark). For example
  (40) noboto yahinoto —ya tobe    yawar —a  —e   —ra
       child burrow     ALL jaguar pull   PUNC PAST INTERROG
       (myth.) 'Did the jaguar pull the child to its burrow?'","[28, 29]"
"  So   far, basic OSV order for Warao has been         exemplified     in
                                6
each    of the major sentence types.      However,   structural
arrangements different from OSV are often found in the
language.   It is common in WaraD discourse to leave out P ’s
whose referents have been set' up earlier. Since the person of
the object of transitive verbs may be     marked in the verb,
transitive.. sentences occur frequently with the verb and the
subject; only. For example, (B) below      TRANSITIVE OSV
  (B) ma     hi       rakoi ahi -a   —e
      lsg.O 2sg.POS sister hit ! PUNC PAST
      'Your sister hit me’  may be reduced as in:       TRANSITIVE SV
! (9) 0 hi        rakoi m—           ahi   —a    -e
; ! :‘    2sg.P0S sister lsg.Q       hit    PUNC PAST
   ( : 'Your sister hit me'   On the other hand, copulative sentences in Warao nearly
always      are      subject    initial,     showing     mostly
S—COMP(lement)—CPF' (ula) order. Further, ha —kitane ‘BE/HAVE
— INFINIT.’, the form denoting ‘COP’ may be deleted giving rise
to S-CQMP order. The examples below illustrate the case:
          COPULATIVE S-COMP-COP
  <1Q) a. tai tira burebaka ha
   i      that;woman insane   COP
          ’That woman is insane’          COPULATIVE S-COMP
       b. tai tira burebaka O
          that woman insane
   1      ’That woman (is) insane’
  Different from 0 and COP which, as shown, may not explicitly
appear in the Warao sentence, B tends to be expressed. This is
so ;because the WaraD verb is unmarked for subject agreement;
hence, subjects need to be present to avoid ambiguities and
misunderstandings. A subjectless sentence such as (lib) below
is exclusively motivated by the discourse environment:   (lib)
ohviously reflects a short answer to a question:
  (11) a. Q: ihi    ma     kaika nao —nak.a        —ra
             2sg.S lsg.O with come NEG              INTERROB

                  come NEG
             ’ (I) do not come’

  The process illustrated by til) above involves a principle
of economy of words which operates in languages wherever the
logic of conversational sequences allows no possible confusion
                                                            1
  From the review of (1-10), the facts of imnportance about
Warao word order are: ti > V is final, (ii) S nearly always
immediately precedes V, and (iii) D mostly occurs in sentence
initial position. Ahead in this Section, the rules that permit
variations from the basic QSV order    are    discussed    and
explained.                                                  I  7. VERBAL SENTENCES                                       ■

  Subjects in Warao lack morphological devices that allow
their identification; for instance, they are not case-marked.
This feature coupled with the fact that Waran is a verb final
language in which the remaining sentence constituents    (both
subject and objects)     usually precede, make subjects very
resistant to deletion. It      might   be expected that overt
subjects contribute to preserve meaning.     Subjects normally
express the agent     of    the action, if there is one. This

"  Moreover, objective PREF PRO’S attach to verbs as the
leftmost morpheme within any possible prefixal chain. PREF
PRO’S often undergo morphological shortening depending upon
whether they are directly attached to c e r t a i n vowel initial
verb roots and other vowel initial verb prefixes (Warao does
not permit vowels of the same quality to come into contact).
The prefixation process and its implications is illustrated in

other languages be distinguished as adverbs,    and including
also locative and time expressions. Adverbs are bound together
into one class on the grounds of their common function as
complement of copulative sentences and obliques (or adjuncts)
in any other sentence types. Adverbs constitute a relatively
large class covering a wide semantic range. They groupi (i)
general verb modifiers, and (ii) manner, location, time i and
quantity expressions.","[74, 75, 76, 77]"

       As a response, the one inquired might choose to narrate
any of his/her most recent experiences. This choice implies
the development of a speech act that may be considered a
sub-type within DEHEWARA A RIBU 'words of saying stories’. The
telling of stories about personal affairs already past or in
progress is known as ERIBU 'words of saying about common
events'. These stories may deal with topics as diverse as
family news, financial or health problems, communal routines
or travelling episodes. A fragment of a conversation on a
journey is offered in (313)      (313) a. wahukatu -ya aka nabaka —n —a  —e

as some particular meanings in euphemistic senses, in accord
with the interacting dyad, since it must be remembered: that
the speaker and the hearer share a religious status. In (316),
maraka 'a rattle’ and kareko ’pebbles of a rattle; are
fundamental instruments to be used and invoked in shamanistic
c u rin g  rituals. This is so in the case of the pebbles of the
rattle because stones are very uncommon in the territories

    according    to circumstances' such as kinship, degree      of
    intimacy, frequency of meeting, purpose of the encounter if it
    is .intentional, and others. Jhis particular speech act tends
    to be rather formal particularly because among the Warao,
    personal relations are plentiful of respect and consideration
    for. the elderly and for the masculine members of the nuclear
    and extended families. Ttius,' this greeting formula is almost
    compulsory;    It is quite likely that individuals who are
    closely: acquainted will use jargon of over sexually—oriented
    content    in   their greeting.    These   interlocutors  will
    incorporate such sexual remarks into BAHUKA A RIBU bringing
    about 'a different type of speech act known as ENOYABA A RIBU
    ’words : of.making fun'. The resultant speech act, an informal
    variant. of BAHUKA A RIBU,; often involves two males, or
    females, of similar age, usually youngsters, that may belong
    to '■the same family or to different ones. The discoursive

       These speech acts and their verbalizations are free
from spatial, temporal and contextual constraints in BAHUKftYA
A RIBU and ENOYABA A RIBU, person is determinant for ,the
occurrence of either one code or the other. If the encounter
of the interlocutors— or participants— in these speech acts
lasts enough as to consider that it fits into the categoryi of
a visit, the interplay of space, time and person contributes
to define a new different speech act called DEHEWARA A RIBU
'words of saying stories'. The latter often proceeds indoors,
once greeting has finished and participants have taken seats
an the floor, or in any available piece of furniture including
hammocks.  The act in most cases begins by questioning the
visitor as exemplified in (312) below
   (312) kasikaha deh -ekira -ra

                     Cpotapotdl ar Cbotobotal. But, Cb3 will tend to appear in
                     Spanish loans, whether they contain /p/ or /b/ stops, for
                     instance, Spanish pelota 'ball* borrows as Warao berota.

                     initial   Cp3 is found in a very reduced set of lexical  items,
                     for example,    [payaral 'kind of fish' which never was heard
                     with the voiced stop. In Warao, Cp3 and Cb3 are unaspirated as
                     all remaining stops,
                       On the other hand, the J r / allophones Cd3Cr3 occur in quite
                     specific phonological environments: (i) Cd3 always appears
                     initially, and (ii) Cr3 is always intervocalic. In Warao,    the
                     Cr3 variant has the highest frequency of occurrence given the

        linguistic     work  draws close    to    social  anthropology.
        Anthropologists working on South America have drawn attention
        to the notion of ""social space"", that is SPACE conceived as
        relevant to society. Brahaoi (1986) studied the usage of three
        styles;    ritual wailing, communal singing and        political
        oratory.   She observed that the styles tends to be associated
        exclusively with distinct parts of the Xavante social space.
        Xavante villages are organized into a semicircle of houses
        around a central plaza. Graham       (1986) noted that ritual
        wailing occurred almost exclusively around the hut, whereas
        political oratory was associated with the plaza, the area
        where the meetings of the men's council occurred. Communal
        singing was in this regard intermediate, taking place in the
        plaza, but also between the plaza and the hut as groups of men
        marched around the village singing.

  (ii)    TIME. Time is a very -frequent co—determinant of usage.
One example of this is discussed by Urban (1987) along the
following lines: in Shakleng, the origin of myth-telling, dr
ceremonial dialogue style, known as the waneklen. and the ■
dyadic chanting style known as the ahan are closely related in
structure-independent     forms,    differing     markedly;  in
structure—dependent aspects. The former style is associated i>
with these rituals for the dead, and it is in this measure
temporally—bound. The latter style occurs at the lip—plug
giving and thigh—tabooing ceremony for 1— to 3—year— old
children.   It only takes place in the latter temporallyj-bound ,
context.  (iii)     PERSON.  A basic distinction, Urban   (1987) notices,
among personal determinants of style has to do with their
relational as opposed to non-relational character. The ! style
may be determined more in terms of the person who is speaking,
regardless of the interlocutor or other aspects of the
context, or mare in terms of the relationship            between
speaker(s)     and   hearer(s).   Among   the    non-relational
determinants are such basic oppositions as that between,; male
and female.    In some cases, there may be full of structural
differences    between men's and women's      speech.    Another
non-relational contrasts involves age, especially, differences
between elder and younger speech.                         j         A relational determinant is style variation depending
upon the kinship relation between speaker and hearer. In; some
Central Brazil    languages, affinal relationships demand a E
formality in interaction which includes linguistic styles.      i.

    (iv)     RFERENTIAL CONTENT. This refers to the content or
subject matter of the discourse which may be associated with ,
stylistic distinctiveness.    In general, style determined by
content is usually referred to as ""genre"". Urban (19B7) i notes
that there are many formal features that          differentiate |‘
myth-telling from other instances of language use, and that j
differentiate one type of myth—tel1ing, that dealing' with
traditional stories, from another, that dealing with the
origin myth. In the case of Shakleng, Urban paints out, , these i-
are mainly lexical and syntactic; however, in other Amazonian |.
languages they may be basically phonological.            j

"   (3) This sociolinguistic sketch of Warao incorporates this
language to the very reduced set of Amazonian languages that
have been looked into upon an adequate theoretical framework.
Many existing analyses written at the turn of the century have
described native languages against a Latin-based grammatical
background.    Despite  increased contributions    about   the
functioning of native languages developed during the past
twenty   years, the Amazon—Orinoco axis still remains        a
linguistic    reservoir about which very little has       been
investigated.   In this particular linguistic context, some
studies of strict phonological, morpho-syntactic and lexical
scope have been completed. Nevertheless, little attention has
been paid to language and society interaction.   Native South
American languages very often offer different patterns and
alternative    forms rooted in societal traits.      In  these
languages, perhaps more than in any others, the property of
variation in languages becomes remarkably significant. I have
found for Warao oral performances that the diverse forms of
stylistic differentiation are intimately linked to social
organization— interacting actively and each one supporting the                               134
other.   In   the   Waraa case, the     study   of   styi isti c
differentiation demands considerations about customs beliefs,
political order,   kinship, alliance, etc-, as well as about
more restricted social circles within society.","[141, 142]"

 there is one or several story—teller(s) addressing a group or
'auditorium. ,<317—319) represent an unidirectional system.
 Uriidirectional    telling 'of 'ancestral tales involves       the
pres'elice:of ‘one, or more individuals of social relevance, as a
 stoHy-teller’ or story-tellers.     Hence, it may be expected
formality, ’ or iat least, a semi—formal treatment.      fts well,
istrnry—tel1ing sessions conducted by such characters appear to
,be highly-bound to spacer They preferably occur in the place
 or the; addresser, who ,would probably be the kobenahoro
 ’governor’ or any aidamp ’chief'. A further aspect to be
considered about the unidirectional situation relates to the
 behavior o f ; the listeners which is almost totally passive,
remaining in silence all over the delivering. In this case,
 listeners' - participations— “if      any— generally       confine
 themselves to collective laughing as a response to stimuli of
 comic nature;    !

       Another speech act that has been detected— called
DIHIBU 'words of giving explanations'— covers discussions
intended for solving communal problems, particularly those
which have caused physical and verbal violence or any other
kind of disagreement among the Warao of a village. !The
contextual situation for DIHIBU is somewhat defined by ithe
time, space, person and referential content parameters, i A
DIHIBU session meets at night in the place of any community
leader, whether this is the home of the kobenahoro 'governor',
or   any airamp 'chief'— the bisi kari     'fiscal',  kabitano
'captain'   or borisia 'policeman'. The confronting parties
together with relatives and friends show up at the meeting
place where the kobenahoro and other chiefs might have
convened, and one by one expresses points of view about the
matter. They may be questioned to clarify doubts.         Once
argumentations    have been evaluated,    one of the    chiefs
interprets what has happened and makes a point on what the
consequences of such deeds may be or might have been. Finally,
he encourages the ceasing of hostilities and the restoration
of harmony between the upset men, groups or families. ;The
chief emphasizes in the need of sticking to peaceful solutions
such as the ancestors always did. The chiefs’ pieces of advice
seldom generate reactions other than those leading to a
settlement;   nonetheless, the participants in DIHIBU meetings
may go on in the discussion of the problem for several hours
to adjust the terms of the arrangement. My data suggests that
consensus is obtained very quickly when the chief is a
skillful orator.    In egalitarian societies like the Warao,
leading statuses correlate with ability to preserve good
interpersonal    relations in groups and communities.      The
opposite condition— current alteration of social order :and
delay to bring it back— means leadership weakening, and often
this triggers the renewal of community heads.","[128, 129]"

Warao examples. Three lines of information appear with most
examples    in the body of the paper:       ii)    a    morphemic
representation giving the underlying     forms    of    all     the

morpheme—by—morpheme English gloss, and (iii) an appropriate,
rather    free,  English translation.    In this     system , of
representation,   common recurring    morphemes      are     given
abbreviated glasses indicated in uppei— case letters. A list- of
these abbreviations is found in the introductory pages of this
research. It must be emphasized that the morpheme glosses are
intended for helping the reader to understand the structure or
usage, either in isolation or contextually.         It is worth
mentioning as well that when examples are intended for
presenting the referential content that characterizes some
styles, the morpheme-by-morpheme English glosses are avoided,
and an almost literal translation is included.                  |                                4

  12. NEGATION
  12.1. Simplex sentence negation (or main clause negation)
  Negation is expressed by means of the suffix -naka 'NEG',
whose scope is the entire sentence. The negative marker —naka
'NEG' is directly attached to the verb root, possibly followed
by a mood marker if the need arises to indicate modality
overtly. It is convenient to state that all unmarked for mood
main clauses are in the indicative. Once —naka 'NEG' has been
added to the verb root, the inflectional markers for number
and aspect/tense appear on the auxiliary verb ta 'AUX'. For
example, the negative sentence in X53)

  In (55), -naka ’NEG’ breaks the verb inflectional string,
inducing the presence of the auxiliary on which aspect j and
tense must appear. In (56) —naka ’NEG’ admits a followingjmood
marker,   in this case —turu 'OPT', which in turn disrupts the
verb inflectional chain, bringing about tense suffixing to the
auxiliary   (In Warao mood markers as well as negative, and
interrogative markers are closing morphemes, so they do, not,
allow further suffixing. Once they break the verb inflectional
chain, the auxiliary becomes the locus for tense/aspectj and
number markers. ISee 26.1.2.3. and 26.1.2.33.             :  12.2. Negation in some sentential constituents                ■

addition of the indefinite determiners ekira 'no' and, ana
’n o ’. ekira/ana 'no' postposed to a noun, an adverb and a

"  26.1.2.1.2. Non-past tense  The non-past marker -te ’NON—PAST’ is used with reference to
present (currency) and future (subsequency) without any formal
distinction between them. Also, -te ’NON-PAST’ is inherently
imperfective, which is inferred from its possible association
with the imperfective punctuality aspect marker -a 'PUNC'. The
non-past tense marker is incompatible with the completive
(inherently perfective) aspect marker of the language:

  Non—past tense adds an element o-f uncertainty since ;a
distinction between ""an event in progress”, ""a         regular
practice"" and ""an event to take place later"", all encoded by
-te 'NON—PAST', is not likely to be captured directly from it;
the precision in meaning being determined only by contents.

   Embedding    in  Warao implies one     clause    holding   a
hypatactical relation with another, whose linkage may be
indicated either by an inflectional morpheme in association
with aspect/mood, or by an independent word        (a sort of
complementizer), or by nothing. The possibilities of combining
negative and non-negative main and embedded clauses, no matter
the kind of linkage between them, are:     (i) negative main
clause/non-negative embedded clause, (ii) non—negative main
clause/negative embedded clause, and     (iii) negative main
clause/negative embedded clause.    In the types in    (i) and
(iii), negation has a broad scope covering the           entire
sentence. Within this context, negation, morpho-syntactically
speaking, operates just as it does within the simplex sentence

  Comitative is expressed by means of the postposition kaika
'in the companion o f ’ or 'with someone’. This postposition
conveys   the comitative sense by indicating someone : in
association with which some entity was or is, or was or is
during the enactment of a situation. In the fallowing example,
the noun phrase in constituency with kai ka 'with someone'
represents someone the actor was in association with while
enacting the situation:

        Antonio   with we go      INT HAB
        (Anthony)
        'We are going with Anthony as usual'
  As well, the presence of kai ka 'with someone' may imply,that
the entity which it introduces is typically of higher status
than the one representing the partner, as in (239)

  (239) reveals the kind of relationship that the Warao      and
the missionaries keep, which is often one in which           the
religious leaders are official authorities protecting        the
natives.","[96, 97]"

                         CONCLUSIONS
   (1) The data provided by Marao and the descriptive analysis
here offered is expected to have broadened the data base
available to linguistic science for purposes of formulating
substantive    and   formal universale an     human   language,
particularly in areas of current theoretical interest s u c h ; as
the determination of basic constituent order, Waran has proven
to be a predominantly object initial language within a very
steady verb final sentential      pattern, which favors       iOSV
arrangement in simplex sentences. Although subjects in Warao
appear    to be erratic constituents often,       fronted     for
highlighting purposes, they may be adjacent to verbs, behavior
which works in support of its classification as a prototypical
CSV language.","[139, 140, 141]"
"        Coming into political organization, the Warao society
is egalitarian,      although social order is controlled        by
individuals who exercise leadership on the grounds of their
•mastery of supernatural and natural farces as well as their
control of oratory and their language proficiency.     Any Warao,
as he grows older and his success in salving community
problems has been tested in practical situations, would have
access to 1eadership.in his family group and by extension to
his neighbors and even his settlement as a whole.       Thus, as
Suirez    (1971) notes, two sorts of jural statuses can be
distinguished:     one for the kobenahoro 'governor’, kabitano
 'captain', bisikari 'fiscal' and borisia 'policeman', who are
the leaders; the other belonging to the nebu 'young men' or
 'workers’.    The   former set groups     under   the    generic
denomination airamotuma 'chiefs'. They are usually the oldest
men in the village. Within the airamotuma 'chiefs', the
kobenahoro takes the supremacy on the grounds of extensive
accumulated experience over the longest time period             as
compared with the others. The remainder-- kabitano. bisikari
and    borisia— become    the   kobenahoro *s  assistants.    The
                              127
kobenahpro ' 5 assistants are younger people and are related to
him by kinship ties in most cases. The need o-f assistants- will-
straight— forwardly depend upon the size of the communities and
even their distribution in the area. Biven that the terms
kobenahoro.     kabitano.   bisikari and borisia are      Ularao
adaptations of Spanish 'gobernador’, ’capitan’, 'fiscal'I and
'policia', it is likely that the original system— prior to the
presence     fo Spanish-descent     settlers  in   the     Warao
homeland— were simply called airamotuma 'chiefs', under; the
supreme leadership of a nobo 'grandfather' of widely-accepted
respectability. At least, the DENQBQ A R1BU 'words of telling
stories about ancestry’ does not report instances of any of
the Spanish-based terms. Rather, such stories often report
ancestral     gran-fathers’ physical dexterities    and   mental
capabi1ities.                                               1
  32. RELEVANT WARAO LINGUISTIC PATTERNS IN SOCIAL CONTEXT       An important linguistic aspect linked to religious, and
political leaders is in passing viewed by Wilbert (1975) when
analyzing a Warao folktale. Wilbert (1975) notices that | ""the
use of metaphoric language among the Warao is largely related
to the social and religious elite of the tribe.    They either
choose archaic words, no longer in common use, or modify* the
current lexicon ""by adding,     suppressing or     substituting
letters, syllables and even words with or without semantic
meaning"" (Barral, 195B:30). Independently from his use of -such
terms as tribe and elite which are incompatible with the Warao
organizational   and   social systems    (Warao   society)  is
egalitarian), Wilbert    (1975) offers adequate observations
about language use. He points out that ""on special occasions
priest—shamans, in trance or not, chant texts that are totally
unintelligible...and chiefs are prone to use connotative
language when each morning before sunrise they chant their
work orders."" Barral (1945:157) also provides information of
linguistic value as follows: The hoarotu when chanting his hoa
artificially modulates his voice in rythmic and varied tones;
intensifying and diminishing volume, always keeping a ipace
with his sacred rattle, wisthing like birds, buzzing) and
chirping like insects, hissing like snakes and s d forth, j       Language codes, or styles, of the kind reported by
Barral   (1945) may of course be distinguished apart frbm a
knowledge of structure.    In such cases, in the absence of
previous contact with Warao, any hearer can nevertheless
detect that a particular style of language is in use, because
it will develop in a specific phonological framework.     These
code variants are in some measure structure-independent;
therefore, they fall outside the scope of this work. In accord
with the theoretical background on style offered in (Bee 30.),
distinctive intonation, metering and voice quality say l,ittle
about language structure. I will exclusively focus on lexical
factors such as the ones mentioned by Wilbert (1975)   inj the
preceding, as well as ir. morpho—syntactic patterns operating

     Harao rj:eligion and order have also been overviewed— the
     possibilities of interlocution may be characterised. It must
     be .'accepted that an explanation of styles in any language
     depends! upon ah adequate interpretation of the roles of the

    ;          The '■ speech act ranking in terms of strong binding on
     person ;at the BAHUKA A RIBU ’words of expressing well-being’
    end ..and ,mild binding on person at the 0IHIBU ’words of giving
    {explanations’ end suggests ;a correlation with a range of
    participation from duads to meetings. BAHUKA A RIBU on the one
     hand presupposes two participants in the absence (or in the
    (presence) of an audience. TJIHIBU on the other includes several
    {participant's performing ""one 'at a time, or even at the same
    time. The intermediate ranking' position— DENOBO A RIBU ’words
    ""ofretelling ‘stories about ancestry’— turns around only one
    (individual addressing to an audience.","[134, 135, 136]"
"      Given   its peculiarities, DIHIBU ’words of       giving
explanations'  as a speech act sets down a specific style.   I
have called it the DERI STYLE 'council style'. The passages of
talk in the DERI STYLE offer very interesting saciolinguistic
data for the three following reasons: (i3 participants focus
on just one topic in most of the cases offering explanations
of actions that depict a problem and identify individuals
playing parts in it. This sort of explanations contain varied
                                130
  phonological, morphosyntactic , and lexical forms that make
  possible to compare manners of saying and behaving. The DERI
  STYLE! closely associates with direct speech, the manner of
  speech nowadays ; considered the keystone for understanding
  dxscoursive sequences and their socio-cultural      meaning and
  inip1ications, Cii) language is used not only for transmitting
; expressions and discussing actions, but it itself represents
  actions    since   every   participant— using   all     possible
, resources— attempts to convince the others of accepting his
 point .of view., One of the major efforts in this respect should
  be .made by the airamotuma 'chiefs' whose fundamental role is
 the -finding; of a solution' to each problem,     for instance,
  persuading the protagonists of an impasse to change the
 attitude of one towards the other and viceversa.         In this
  sense, - the DERI STYLE is a source of data for studying
 performativity’ (Brimes,    1975), and   (iii) contents reveal
 linguistic     usages   that allows to explore degrees        of
 proficiency and personal attitudes of the Warao towards the
 Warao language. The passages of talk in the DERI STYLE offered
 by participants, independently from statuses, point out the
.relevance, of such conceptual relations as those shown in
  (323> belriw        (36) obonobo ===> dibu ===> yanoko ===> yakerata
             think        say       listen      solve
             (Briggs, 198B)   '    Several notes of morpho—syntactic value about Warao by
Barr si   (195B) have been included in ethnographies, grammars
and dictionaries in the absence of an analysis of styles in
this language. As a result, some of the remarks by Barra! lack
justifications,    and in the case of other       authors their
appreciations are not convincent. For instance, Barral     (195B)
mentions     that ""occultism""— or what he personally        calls
 ""literary camouflage""— is an outstanding quality of the speech
of the airamotuma 'chiefs' and wisiratu 'shamans'. Barral adds
that the airamotuma and wisiratu try to create a sort of
mysterious environment around them to reach the goal to put
intentionally a belief into any Warao's mind, and since the
Warao are candid, as he says, the use of language showing
uncommon     arrangements   and   realisations   of    difficult
interpretation becomes an instrument f a r     such a purpose.
Socially,    Barral's judgement may be true, but from           a
linguistic perspective, his explanation is insufficient.         I
have found that what seems to be simply ""literary camouflage""
represents indeed manifestations of stylistically-motivated
syntactic    patterns and lexicon.    For instance,     suffixal
pronouns, and morphological causatives of di—transitive verbs
are typical in the DERI STYLE, and some of these structures
are variants of other structures commonly used in everyday
language. It appears to be that the emphatic value of suffixal
pronouns as opposed to the semantic effect of prefixal ones
arid   the    possibilities   of   language   enrichment     that
morphological di—transitive causatives bring about as compared
with other causatives are important tools in discoursive
                              131

  12.3. Complex sentence negation
  For complex coordinate sentences which relate two (or more)
finite  (or tensed) clauses paratactically, negation operates
such as in simplex sentences: —naka 'NEB' is suffixed to the
verb of one or the other clause, or both, depending on whether
conjointness  (or disjointness), or adverseness is involved.
Such an addition of the negation marker to verbs triggers :the
regular tense and aspect inflection movements linked to the
presence of the auxiliary ta 'AUX' elsewhere.","[36, 37]"
"          10.1.2. |1.1. Clausal conjunction
      .Clausal! conjunction takes place when referents in subject
     and/or object roles within two paratactical1y-related clauses
     do not change, making possible reduction in one of them. Even
     when the1 two clauses may keep:all their constituents— in a
     sort of full coordinate sentence— such as      j (20) o s i b u 1,, h o s e i t o         yaba    -n   -a   —e      teka      tai
      I ..'i ,mo‘rokDto Joseito                  fish    =g    PUNC PAST   peccary   he

      kub -a     —e
      hunt PUNC PAST
      'Joe fished morokoto (and) he hunted peccary',
  it is likely that repeated subjects and/or objects       undergo
ellipsis, such as illustrated in (21)
  (21) osibu    hoseito   yaba -n -a  —e      teko     0
       morokoto Joseito   fish sg PUNC PAST    peccary

       fish)      kub   -a   -e
      hunt   PUNC PAST
      'Joe fished morokoto (and)   (he) hunted peccary’
  Another example of clausal conjunction is offered in (22)
  (22) aru    tai kona -n -a     -e    hi sab -a  —e
       manioc he bring sg F'UNC PAST cook      PUNC PAST
       ’He brought manioc (and) (he) cooked (manioc)’
  10.1.2.1.2. Clausal adversative junction
  Paratactical clauses may also suggest an         adversative
linkage.  Adversative coordination is normally encoded by
negating one of the clauses within the sentence. This is often
the case in Warao, as illustrated in (23)
  (23) a. tai   ine hahobu     —bu -a   —e    mi -naka
          3sg.O I   search for ITER PUNC PAST see NEG
          ’I searched for him repeatedly (but) (I did) not see
          (him)’       b. warao ekoro —naka —te      musimo        ekoro
          Warao finish NEG   NON-PAST Carib people finish
          (lit.)  ’The Warao do not finish (but) the Caribs
          finish’, or
          'The Carib are terminated, but the Warao are not’
  There    are   also instances of antithetical adversative
junction in which apposite lexical meaning (in the absence of
the negation marker —naka ’NEG’) is sufficient to express
adverseness:
                              14
         (24) tama -tika -mo sanuka    tai mi -na —te

    .    1 ' ■: ■
      Disjunction conveys the idea of exclusion. In Waraa, the
    logics of discourse is the only        resource to be used for
    determining which clause content excludes the other one.
    Disjunction   seems not to be         well integrated      in   the
    interclausal   relations   of     the   language.    Warao—Spanish
    bilingual speakers who know the use of              the     Spanish
    disjunctive: coordinates frequently express doubts about the
    appropriatness of examples when asked to     attest     them. They
    sometimes frame their disjunctive coordinates upon the Spanish
    framework incorporating o ’o r ’ to their native utterance.    The
    best example collected in my data is presented in (25) below
! , (25) yatu nao -te         nao —naka ta -te     —ra

comparison.   (26d) is a case of an attribute noun functioning
as an adverb.","[20, 21, 22, 23]"
"
  The   predominant   pattern of heavy stress is       onthe
penultimate    vowel, antepenultimate heavy stress remaining
confined to same onomatopoeic words and ultimate heavy stress
to Spanish loans which are heavily stressed in the ultimate
syllable in that language.       Heavy stress almost    without
exception falls on the second syllable from the end in
disyllables, trisllables and polysyllables.       Monosyllables
generally bear heavy stress if the syllable pattern in CV, and
weak stress if the syllable patern is V (Romero Figueroa,
1986b).    In    some cases,    monosyllables  are   completely
unstressed. Further, heavy stress in Warao often shifts to the
right in search for penultimate syllables once roots take
inflections.     This displacement obviouslyoccurs    across
morphemic boundaries.    fin example of Warao stress shift is
provided in (309)
  (309) nahbro        nShord -te            'You eat'        nahiro —nAka          'You do not eat'         nahorb -nak& -ra     'Don’t you eat?’
  The marking of weak stress in (309) agrees with a rule by
which alternate syllables are stressed with weak secondary
stress, counting back from the heavily stressed syllable, and
syllables not stressed with heavy stress are unstressed;  In Warao, no two words are distinguished by placement of
stress.   Stress has a purely delimitative function in the
language. Root boundaris may be set departing from the
syllables    bearing   heavy stress which will     always   be
penultimate, alterning with unstressed and weak syllables
either to the right or to the left. This behavior implies that
the next heavily-stressed syllables necessarily belong to
other roots. Root boundary setting also demand an analysis of
allophone    distribution, specially that of those      solely
appearing word-initially.",[119]

 : 20. DETERMINERS
 ' 20.T. Demonstrative determiners
  This is a class of three members which shares with nouns the
suffixation of the number marker -tuma 'PL'. The paradigm of
Warao demonstrative determiners is presented in TABLE 3 below               PROXIMAL              SINGULAR                PLURAL              tama      'this'        tama —tuma ’these'               DISTAL              SINGULAR                PLURAL              ta(i) 'that'            ta -tuma    'those'
              ama   ’that yonder'     ama -tuma   'those yonder
           TABLE 3: Demonstrative determiners  The items in TABLE 3 are part of a small set of definite
determiners, which locate their heads with respect to the
deictic center of the speech situation in at least three
degrees of distance.    Such demonstrative determiners     may
indistinctly precede or follow head nouns within noun phrases,
though postceding seems to be most widely spread:
  (112) a. noboto -ma ta    -tuma
           child   PL that PL

 20.2.   Interrogative and indefinite determiners
  As in a number of Amazonian languages, WaraD has a small set
of determiners which show two major uses:      indefinite I and
interrogative. These are                                  !                a. sina     'who/some/any'               b. kasi kaha 'what/some/any’
            TABLE 4: Interrogative   and   indefinite
                     determiners  The two major senses for each determiner are linked, iWhat
the determiners indicate is that the identity of an entity is
not known to the speaker. The interrogative sense may be
engendered, depending on content although it may be morpholo­
gically instantiated by the verb suffix —ra 'INTERROG'.  These
process is exemplified in (113)                          I
        INTERROGATIVE                                    i

         'In what day will ou go?'","[58, 59]"
"                    Moreover^, the, verb number marker -na 'sg' in several of the
                 sentences of the narrative in          (81) sets up a sort of
                 cor-eferential | relationship with; the     sentential   subjects

                 ta| the fact that third person subjects are usually left out,

construction consisting necessarily ot a head noun and a ‘rc
which restricts such a head noun by giving a proposition that
must be true ot the actual reterent ot the overall sentence
(Comrie,    1981:136),     In    agreement    with     Camrie’s
characterization, Keenan (1935:141) points ou that RC's are
tull noun phrases consisting at a determiner, a common noun
and an rc. Keenan adds that semantically the common noun
(henceforth N) determines a class of objects, called the
domain of relativization and the rc identifies the sub—set of
the domain, those elements which satisfy the condition given
by the RC. In Waraa R C ’s, the domain N occurs within the rc,
which makes them internal (as opposed far instance to English,
in which the domain N occurs outside the rc):  (32)   ima -ya domu nari       -te   Icotaimi — kitane

  In (32), the rc imaya narite kotai 'that flies at night'  is
split   by domu 'bird', the domain N. Thus, the RC iroaya domu
narite kotai 'the bird that flies at night' is clearly of  the
internal class.    In Waraa, subject and abject nouns may : be
relativized. The relativizer item is kotai 'REL'.","[48, 49]"

         understood, the remaining varieties up to the most formal one
        .can be grasped. This approach strongly favors sociolinguistic
         studies,   concerning societies different from those        most
        !linguists belong to, and languages quite distinct from the
         one, or ones they speak. This is so because we would be unable
         to =comprehend language performances if the social       setting
         where they occur is unknown to us. Of course, the linguistic
         interpretation ; of any language is successful when          the
        .researcher is perceived by natives as a part of the group and
         they start to act as if the linguist were not present.","[119, 120]"
"
          Styles can also contain phonological markers.        In this
        respect,   Brown   & Fraser   (1979)   indicate   that    radio
        commentators,   for instance, make use of extra stress for
        loudness contrasts, and use intonation both to          connect
        segments into lengthy, apparently coherent, sentences, and
        also to give clear indications of finality.     This kind of
        phonological features that may be associated to particular
        styles are widely spread over languages of the world.",[120]
"
  Structurally speaking, nominal (label covering denominal
adjective—like   nouns    and     adverb—functioning     nouns)
comparatives in Warao consist of    two sentences     holding a
paratactical   relation, one containing the       standard,   of
comparison and the other containing the topic of comparison.
Some constituents which are repeated in the standard and topic
clauses, that is to say, that are common to both, are often
deleted, and the remaining are joined together to give rise to
an elliptical comparative sentence. Thus, at a level below the
surface, for example, (26b) and (26d) would respectively ;have
syntactic configurations as follows in (27a0 and (27b):    ;
                                                           I  (27) a. Cihi kubatu yak    —era ha 3 Choseito kubatu

   .On the other hand, -from the review o-f (26-28), some -facts of
 importance about the Warao comparatives are: (i) the language
 uses analytical comparison'exclusively, and (ii) it lacks an
 element that 'may be considered to have the status of a
 ""complementizer"".   Related to '(ii), in the absence of a
;""d:ompiemehtiZer""-like element,ino alternative mechanism such
 as case—marking of the standard Iof comparison is used.","[23, 24]"

of expressing large amounts and quantities, the trend in Warao
is to use indefinite determiners and pronouns. Further, the

kind    exemplified  in  (135). Further,    a   sub-class   of
distributives is exclusively expressed as a postpositional
phrase containing cardinals introduced by tane, which can be
roughly‘glossed as English ’times’, tane ’times’ postposed to
any figure indicates the number of times an action occurs. For

            In Warao,    parts of the sets of personal pronouns are
          independent.   or free morphemes in all of their possible                                         63

occurrences in sentences, whether they identify singular or
plural persons. Also, parts of the sets of subject and abject
personal pronouns may be affixed, or bound, to verbs. These
sets of bound morphemes are reduced in number, and they ; are
restricted to the first and second singular person as well as
the first person for both subject and object functions.   j  The subjective free pronouns (hereafter IND PRO's) and the
bound ones   (hereafter SUF PRO's) arrange in a system as
follows in TABLE 11:                                    !","[67, 68, 69, 70, 71]"

           To obtain casual speech in context implies the sharing of
*i       experiences    with   the   social group    or   groups under
        •
        ‘investigation.   This also means an extensive involvement with
‘r 1     the; members of the group(s). A fundamental achievement in
         sociolinguistic researches the obtaining of speech in which
         experiences and involvement conflate.n           In   most societies, perhaps all, contexts of
         interaction    set up such dimensions      as
         serious—trivial, open network-closed network,
                                                                 speech
                                                         sacred—secular,
                                                             and several
         other value scales CBrown & Fraser, 1979), which ultimately
         lead to the use of particular styles. Speech styles vary with
        ^participants in diverse manners. According to Brown S< Fraser
          (1979), we may distinguish between speech styles as markers of
    i    various characeristies of the individual speakers and speech
         styles as markers of relationships among participants. What is
         mast distinctive about many of these styles is the nature of
        -the. lexicon.   Brown 5* Fraser.(1979)  mention that doctors,
         stockbrokers and gamblers,use different words while performing
         their respective roles. Since the topics of their talk are
         quite different this is harly surprising, and if all, what was
         claimed was that different activities require          different
         vocabularies.   But of course, even as far as vocabulary is
        -concerned, there is more to it than that.     For professional
        -groups are likely to be using technical terms for activities
         which would be discussed in different terms by layman.",[120]
"  24.1. General modifiers  These   items   and   attributive nouns    do   not   differ
morphologically. Their adverbial connotation is set up by the
relationship they hold with the verb to which they adjoin. For
example!  (172) dakobo rakobo hi-       esemoi aisia asa

 :24.2. Manner adverbs i    ^           i'              -i        ‘
  Manner :is usually expressed by the pair tuatane ’thus' and
tuatane ana 'not thus"" preceding verbs. This usage suggests an
extra pragmatic -force in the verb:
 ; (175), monida:  ebe        iwirinoko a iramo tuatane
          sickness because of Wirinoko o-f chief thus           , .eicoro —n —a    —e
          ’; ; finish' sg PIINC PAST
               '.The chief of Wirinoko finished (died) thus because of
               sickness'
     (176) tuatane ana nana —naka ta —n —a   —e
          1 thus     no do     NEB AUX sg PUNC PAST
            'He did not do (it) (not) thus'  Furthermore, manner may be denoted by the postposition tane
'manner/way of doing something’ attached to nouns, which gives
rise to postpositional phrases functioning as either comple­
ments in copulatives, or adjuncts in other types of sentences:
 t(177)' irtare  tane   naru -Icotu
         silence manner go    2pl.IMP
         'You all, go silently!’

           jaguar', or
           'We thought (that) you were like a jaguar'  Manner   is   also encoded by means of       the   privative
postposition omi   'PRIV or 'without' which is intended for
preventing the entity to which is attached from the effects of
the verb of the sentence, creating an opposite meaning:                                       71

previous participants.                                ,  24.3. Location adverbials                                                         i
  Adverbial location is expressed by either a small set, of
deictic locatives, or a large set Qf postpositional phrases,
or a few adverbs of place.                              ^

   TABLE 13: Deictic locatives  TABLE 13 shows that local meaning is expressed by the ;same
set of ""general"" local case markers of the language, with the
exception of —ti ka and ^a which seem to be pertinent to. the
deictic locatives.   Also, TABLE 13 reveals that such local
markers may co-occur to increase the level of specificity of
the locatives, which makes them morphologically complex. :Some
examples of the usage of deictic locatives are presented in

"        It j(is .clear from (26) that the language has asymmetrical
      comparison of inequality,      (A>B, and A<B). klarao also has
      comparison    of equality,    (A-B). The data, by      means    of
      arrangements .such as the-: one in      (26d) demonstrates the
      possibility 'of asymmetrical equality.      However, the     data
      indicates!that symmetrical equality (AB=) (similar to English
      ’same/equal/like/alike') is prevalent in the language.        The
      strongest! indicator of symmetrical equality is the kind of
      relationship ti holding between the topic of comparison and the
      standard of comparison in casesIsuch as (29), far example:
         (29) tama —ha , raisa monuka ha
             : this iNOM other same     i COP
             ) 'The other! and this one are the same', or
             > 'This and the other are the same'Y t Ina (29), t t h e topic of'comparison and the standard of
   comparison     keep a figure/figure relation rather than a
   figure/background one.
.}. ,    .<(
     .Also,, from   (26—29), it might be said that in Uarao,
   comparison is expressed by postposing to atributive nouns some
•!.quantity jdeterminers, such as Ikuarika 'more' and sabuka or
- valioto 'iess'     in the c a s e ’of inequality, and the adverb of
   manner..monuka 'same/equal'j' in.the case of equality.",[24]
