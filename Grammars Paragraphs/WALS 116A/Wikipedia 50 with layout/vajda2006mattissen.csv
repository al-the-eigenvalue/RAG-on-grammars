   DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND W O R D H O O D IN NIVKH
After having studied the morphophonemics characteristic of Nivkh, the crucial questions
to explore are (i) which status do the entities in which we observed these mechanisms
have? and (ii) which morphological type does Nivkh exhibit? The first question can be
reformulated in the following way: Are the complexes single words? The answer to this
question is of course the basis for any discussion about the morphological type. It is,
however, not easy to determine, and constitutes a topic carefully avoided in grammatical
sketches of Nivkh after a first dispute on it ended without agreement between the parties.
We will therefore proceed to study the evidence for the morphological status of Nivkh
complexes.","[75, 76]"

"3.8.3 The complex in the clause
Turning now to the syntactic behavior of words, Nivkh complexes are permuted in a
clause as wholes, and their rightmost constituent, the head, is inflected for the gramma­
tical categories a simplex lexeme of the same lexical category is. In particular, it is the
only constituent to bear the markers of the obligatory categories of case, mood or con-
verb, which mark the right edge of a complex.
         Complexes are also questioned and substituted as wholes. A nominal complex
is questioned with the interrogative pronouns aŋ ""who"", siḑ ""what"", or řaḑ ""which one"",
and can be substituted by the demonstrative pronouns, such as təḑ ""this one"", həḑ ""that
one"", etc. A verbal complex is questioned by jaḑ (~jā- -jaγa-) ""what does s.o./sth. do?""
(for dynamic verbs) or jaʁoḑ ""how is s.o./sth./what is sth. like?"" (for static verbs) and
substituted by haḑ ""s.o./sth. does so"" or toyaḑ, hoγaḑ, etc. ""s.o./sth. is thus"" (see e.g.
Panfilov 1962:255, Otaina 1978:16). The verbal question and substitute forms are verbs
themselves, as their inflectional paradigms show.",[124]
"Interrogatives questioning an undergoer synthesize to the verb in spite of their usually
assumed focal status. An undergoer interrogative is external only of a topical verb: ex­
amples (111) and (113) contrast different uses of interrogatives.",[162]
"The case of coordination nicely supports the general principle of complex formation in
Nivkh: only adjacent constituents in a dependent-head relation synthesize. Coordinated
forms, however, are not in a dependent-head relation to each other. We therefore should
not expect synthesization.
          Coordination is different from other cases of non-synthesization as there is still
a noun + verb complex (with the last coordinated undergoer). Syntactic mechanisms and
pragmatic reordering of constituents in the sentence result in the complete dissolution of
the complex, i.e. undergoer and verb are two separate and usually non-adjacent consti­
tuents, as we will see. In this situation, the transitive verb, for which a reflex of its under­
goer is obligatory, takes a 3s undergoer prefix or (if it is single obstruent initial) appears
in its fricative-initial allomorph. A noun which is 'excorporated' from a primary object-
verb complex never triggers a bound allomorph or an alternated initial sound of the verb.
Thus, there are then two elements in the sentence referring to one and the same partici­
pant, the undergoer. The important question arising from this situation concerns the ar­
gument and referentiality status of the elements referring to that participant. Remember
that the undergoer prefix is obligatory in the absence of a nominal undergoer synthesi­
zing to the verb, but mutually exclusive with this nominal undergoer in the undergoer
slot of the verbal template. This question will be discussed in chapter 5.",[166]
"Interrogative pronouns questioning attributive nouns and quantifiers are themselves
found in the attributive slot, synthesizing to a noun (see Panfilov 1962:242, 254-255).
They may not be constructed as free forms, despite their inherent focusing.",[239]

         Determiners are not obligatory and thus not grammaticalized in Nivkh, i.e. they
do not function as an article system. Therefore it seems safe to assume that the head con­
stituent of a noun complex is indeed the noun, not the determiner. Determiners obliga­
torily synthesize to their head noun (Krejnovic 1966:38-40). There is no other way of
constructing a determiner in an analytical fashion.

"8.1      Synthesizing possessor
Besides prefixes, a possessor is expressed by non-singular personal pronouns, by inter­
rogative or demonstrative pronouns, or by nouns. Prefixes and pronouns are mutually
exclusive as possessors, but may be combined with nominal possessors. Pronouns syn­
thesize to their possessee in the absence of corresponding prefixes. Compare:        ţ aqo ""knife"" (Krejnovič 1934:205)

        p-saqo           ""one's own knife""All pronouns trigger nasal alternation regardless of their final sound
         A possessor may also be expressed with a demonstrative pronoun, which is com­
posed of a deictic root and a suffix (see chapter 1.3.2), most commonly -ḑ. The presence
of a suffix, e.g. -ḑ, the alternation triggered on the noun, and the meaning distinguishthe
demonstrative from the determiner, as in the following examples.

dent from consonant alternation. The complex is not split up if any component is ques­
tioned, but instead remains intact.","[235, 236]"
"The last sentence was not read from a card, but uttered spontaneously in a conversation
between the consultant and the interviewer.
         For phonetic proof of the accent position in a language, it must be determined
which parameters identify the accentuated syllable. Possible parameters are fundamental
frequency, formants, intensity and duration of segments (see Sachse 1998). As the rele­
vant parameters and their correlation vary by language, speaker, situation, and linguistic
context, a larger sample of speech data has to be evaluated. Unfortunately, we only have
data from one single speaker for the present analysis, and the relevant parameters for the
determination of accent in Nivkh have never been examined.
         Thus, as a first approximation, a waveform, an intensity plot, a fundamental fre­
quency plot, and a spectrogram were calculated for each sentence. The respective dia­
grams are displayed in that order for each sentence in the appendix, and they gave rise to
the following observations:
         The comparison of Bondarko & Zinder's waveforms and ours confirms the ob­
servation that in (undergoer) noun + verb complexes there is a greater amplitude in the
noun stretch, e.g. in the waveforms for (38a), (38d), whereas in noun + noun complexes,
e.g. vo-nlami ""half of the village"" in (38d), there are no significant amplitudinal differen­
ces, e.g. in (38f), (38g), where there are structurally parallel forms to Bondarko &
Zinder's examples.
                  DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD                                    91
In the question in (38c), the waveform shows a greater amplitude in the verbal element
stretch. This may be influenced by the question enclitic, which has the greatest ampli­
tude in the complex. The emphatically lengthened vowel in (38f) also has a conspicuous­
ly high amplitude, which fits in nicely with Panfilov's observation that emphatic leng­
thening attracts stress (see above).
          As is obvious from sentences (38a), (38b), and (38e), all exhibiting a structure
not represented in Bondarko & Zinder's sample, amplitude is greater for the verb root
than for the noun root in attributive verb + noun complexes. This leads us to suspect that
stress falls on the attributive verb, which is confirmed by the auditive impression.
          In the fundamental frequency plots (the 'pitch contours'), which suggest the
location of stress, there are visible stretches in all plots which start around 220 to 250 Hz
and drop to around 140 Hz. In some of these stretches, fundamental frequency decreases
rather continuously: mer-umgu-k'ezḍ ""told our woman"" (possessor + undergoer noun +
verb), ţaq-xir ""with a trident"", q otr-t'ər-lovř-ţevḍ ""stabbed the bear in its left armpit"" (a
rather large complex containing a possessor, an attribute, the undergoer noun and the
verb), imŋ-k'imḍ ""gave them"" (undergoer and ditransitive verb), ţaq-mi-fiḍ ""is lying in its
cradle"" (noun + relational morpheme + local transitive verb), řaŋzlu ţo-voḍ ""took some
fish"" (copredicate + undergoer-verb complex). In others, fundamental frequency first
rises to some extent, then drops. The latter behavior is true of subjects (Vagun, aŋa
""who"", vo-ñlami ""half the village"" (nominal possessor + noun), maţkilk-ōla ""small
child"" (attribute + noun), ţo-ŋəŋ-ñivy-ux ""from the fisherman"" (inflected compound
noun)) and discourse markers (haŋan ""then""), as well as of amra-qauḍ ""has no taste""
and ţaj-ra-ja ""drink tea!"" (undergoer + verb). These stretches of a recurring fundamen­
tal-frequency contour (which we perceive as pitch contour units) are thus highly charac­
teristic in that they end in an extreme section and always start anew at the same medium
height. In other words, pitch contour units are formed by discourse markers (like haŋan
""then""), the subject complex (e.g. Vagun, maţkilk-ōla ""small child"", tuzyət-ţaj ""cooled
down tea""), the undergoer-verb complex (mer-umgu-k'ezḍ ""told our woman"", q'otr-t'ər-
lovř-ţevḍ ""stabbed the bear in its left armpit"", ţaq-mi-fiḍ ""is lying in its cradle""), and also
compounds (amra-q'auḍ ""has no taste"", ţo-ŋəŋ-ñivy-ux ""from the fisherman""), which
may become quite complex as well. The spontaneous utterance is no different than the
ones read from the cards.
          Somewhat less clear are ku-ena-umgu ""that other woman"" (determiner +
attribute + noun) with an unexpected rise at the end, hays-ku-fχojḍ-ŋa ""is washing the
clothes?"" (inflected undergoer noun + verb), and dlf-yo verax-ko ""servants and slaves""
 (coordinated nouns), which all lack an overall falling contour. In the question in (38c),
 frequency starts decreasing in the predicate, but then rises to over 350 Hz in the question
 enclitic; the whole contour is obviously influenced by the question intonation at its end.
 Interestingly, fundamental frequency decreases in the roots of the two coordinated nouns
 in (37d), but the coordinating associative morphemes display level frequency as a sort of
 additional phonological marker of coordination. Thus, an overall principle of stretches
 characterized by a falling pitch contour seems to be justifiable and applies to all three
 structural types of complexes, noun + noun, noun + verb, and verb + noun.
92                    DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
The intensity level plots (representing loudness and displayed in the 'magnitude' dia­
grams) show a certain correlation to the fundamental frequency plots in their peaks.
Compare the diagrams for hagan ""then"", mer-umgu-k'ezḍ ""s.o. told our woman"", tuz-yət-
ţaj ""cooled down tea"", pq-mi-fiḍ ""s.o. is lying in the cradle"", Vagun, vo-ñlami ""half of
the village"", imŋ-k'imḍ ""s.o. gives them"", as well as the question word aya and the ques­
tion enclitic -ŋa. The string tuz-yət-ţaj ""cooled down tea"" is a nice example.
          Fundamental frequency starts at 325 Hz and drops continuously. Intensity also
peaks on the first syllable and never reaches this level again in that string. This is true
mutatis mutandis for the first syllables of the other complexes listed above. Pitch and in­
tensity seem to correlate in marking the stressed syllable in these cases; their peaks,
however, do not necessarily coincide in our diagrams, e.g. in ţoŋsŋñivyux ""from the
fisherman"", q'otr-ţ'ər-lovř-ţevḍ ""stabbed the bear in its left armpit"", and ţaqxir ""with a
trident"".
          The spectrograms allow us to identify pausing (in contrast to the waveforms
against background noise). Krejnovič (1979), Jakobson (1971:78) and Watanabe (1992:
 185) point out that within a complex, pauses are inadmissible. The spectrograms display
some telling pause units between (exceptionally) black stretches wherever there is no
energy output during a sound chain, e.g. ku-ena-umgu ""that other woman"", containing
determiner, attribute and head noun; pq-mi-fiḍ ""s.o. is inside the cradle"", consisting of
a local transitive verb and its complement, a noun + relational morpheme; ţaj-ra-ja
""drink tea!"", with a monotransitive verb and its patient; and imŋ-k'imḍ, a ditransitive
verb with its recipient. They each have continuous spectrograms just like the compound
ţoŋəŋñivyux ""from the fisherman"".
          The individual pause structures of the utterances analyzed here confirm the pitch
contour units we identified above, as there are pauses before each medium fundamental
frequency onset and after each extreme offset.
          Hence, there is good evidence for the existence of accentual units in Nivkh that
are also pause units and which are co-extensive with the complexes identifiable on mor-
phophonemic and structural grounds. As accentual and pause units, complexes are no
different in status than inflected forms or compounds.","[101, 102, 103]"

the same way allomorphs of other inflectional suffixes are. They are mutually exclusive

They are distinguished from mood here because they are identical in form to suffixes of
the nominal paradigm.

stem and the finite ḑ-form. The difference in semantics is not easy to pinpoint (cf. Krej-

"Not all of these criteria must be fulfilled for a language to be considered polysynthetic,
but the questions of which parameters are essential or how many of them must be ful­
filled in which combination is usually not discussed in the literature. An exception is
Drossard (1997:253), who postulates as a minimal condition that a language must inte­
grate adverbial material in a bound form within the verb form in order to be counted as
polysynthetic, even without polypersonalism or the integration of nominals (via noun in­
corporation or denominal verbs). This condition seems to be designed too broadly in
view of the fact that languages possessing preverbs,. such as German, Russian, or South
Caucasian, also fulfill it but are otherwise not convincing polysynthetic languages. Com­
pare some examples:

a lexical or morphological word.
         Native speakers of German have a feeling for the ambiguous status of the
remnant. When asked how many words Eröffnungs- und Schlußwort are, informants said
three; the explanation for this assessment was: ""because that is the way you write it"".
The third question, whether *Eröffnungs then constitutes a word, prompted hesitation
and finally denial, the informants' explanation being that ""the word is actually/is
abbreviated from Eröffnungswort"" ""opening address"".
         Such a clash between phonological and morphological word status could be at
the heart of Nivkh complex splitting under coordination as well (note that we already
distinguished phonological and morphophonological wordhood in 3.7). Evidence for this
assumption is constituted by the behavior of personal prefixes. As we saw above, perso­
nal prefixes are always the leftmost element in a word form and need a host to attach to.
If, for example, a nominal head is modified by two coordinated attributes and is pos­
sessed, the possessor is marked on the first, non-synthesizing attribute, while the second
118                   DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH

Non-transitive verbs do not participate in the dependent-head synthesis as heads, with
the exception of intransitive verbs (expressing value, dimension, color, or quantity) that
incorporate the noun which would be their theme in a clause construction (cf. chapter
2.1). The mechanism as such is productive, as can be seen in a whole series of forms
from a handful of verbs, urɖ ""sth. is good"", qoɖ ""sth. hurts"", pilɖ ""sth. is big"", kәlɖ ""sth.
is long"", verd ""sth. is wide"", ulɖ ""sth. is high"", ţarjɖ ""[pelt] is white"", piuɖ ""[hair/skin]
is black"", tamɖ ""there are a lot"" (cf. Otaina 1978:36-38, 17-23). In addition, intransitive
verbs can incorporate body part nouns. All resulting incorporating forms seem to be lexi-
calized, as the nominal component cannot be questioned or substituted, which is possible
in noun + verb complexes (cf. Otaina 1978:32; chapter 3.8.3).","[146, 147]"
"Three other languages with inflection within a word unit are Greenlandic, Huichol and
Ket (see chapter 9.3). In the following example from Greenlandic, not only an interroga­
tive root, but also a form bearing possessive and case inflection (local case only) is de­
rived to form a denominal verb. The verbalizer ""be"" is, however, lexicalized together
with the case marker.

whereas for plural goals, such as the name of the city of Aasiaat, a plurale tantum, the
verbalizer starts with a string identical to the allative plural on nouns {-nú). Altogether
there are four such verbalizers in Greenlandic. The Greenlandic case shows that inflec­
tion is not incompatible with derivation and gives rise to the question of whether noun
incorporation may resemble word formation in this respect. Nivkh is less spectacular
than Greenlandic in that case is never integrated into a complex.
         Iturrioz (2001:721) claims that in Huichol (Uto-Aztecan), nouns may be incor­
porated with number and case marking, but only gives examples for number marking.","[189, 190]"
"These findings should serve to remove any reservations about the wordhood of Nivkh
complexes.
         Having studied different cases of complex nouns cross-linguistically, we have
found two basic types: (i) languages which form complex nouns with a chain of deriva­
tional or inflectional morphemes, and (ii) languages which form complex nouns by con­
catenation of lexical roots. This classification fits the picture of polysynthesis well,
where we observed a type which chains affixes and a type which coalesces lexical roots
(see chapter 7). The existence of complex nouns does not necessarily presuppose a poly-
synthetic language, as Sanskrit and German show.
         Here we will again take up the question posed at the end of chapter 8: How are
such noun complexes to be interpreted in linguistic theory? Is there such a thing as a po-
lysynthetic noun? The complex nouns in all the languages we have presented at least ex­
hibit the principle of head marking in the sense of Nichols (1986).
         Looking at the situation from the perspective of the concept of polysynthesis, we
find that while the ideas about polysynthetic verb complexes are fairly congruent, there
is no unanimity as to what nominais should look like in polysynthetic languages.
Mithun, working on Native American languages, points out that nouns are for the most
part not inflected for number, gender, or case, and that there are no obligatory NPs or
number agreement (1988:443, 444). Baker, restricting the domain of polysynthesis to a
phenomenon consisting, roughly, of polypersonalism and incorporation (and thereby ex­
cluding languages such as Greenlandic; 1996:18-20), adds that word order is free and
that there are no true quantifiers or determiners in polysynthetic languages. Nichols
(1986:105) explicitly states that ""there are no polysynthetic nouns"", relegating complex
noun forms in languages like Eskimo, Algonquian, Sioux, and Iroquoian to word forma­
tion. She also considers the ""adjective-noun"" relation to be ""least prone to be head-
marked"" (1986:76). As a quintessence, the noun in a polysynthetic language leads a life
in the shadow of the highly complex verb form due to its presumed simplicity. As we
have seen in the last two chapters, however, nouns need not be that simple, as evidenced
e.g. by Greenlandic, Tariana, Chukchi, and Wichita.
         The only authors who allow for such complex nouns in polysynthetic languages
are Fortescue and Aikhenvald. Fortescue (1994:2601) includes, in his catalogue for the
identification of polysynthesis, criteria such as the incorporation of an adjectival stem
into a noun and the marking of the possessor on a noun, which correspond to the features
observed in this chapter. This different viewpoint is understandable when taking into
account that Fortescue has Eskimo in mind. Aikhenvald (1999) explicitly describes the
structure of the complex noun form in Tariana as polysynthetic, as we saw above,
without discussing the theoretical implications of this claim.
                                 COMPLEX NOUN FORMS                                          271
Support for the idea of a poly synthetic noun comes from old sources: In drawing a di­
stinction between incorporation and poly synthesis, Hewitt (1893:392) cites an article by
Brinton (1885) stating that ""polysynthesis is a method of word-building, applicable
either to nominais or verbals"", and adds from the same source (1893:398)        As polysynthetic elements we have the inseparable possessive pronouns which
        in many languages are attached to the names of the parts of the body and to the
        words for near relatives; also the 'generic formatives', particles which are pre­
        fixed, suffixed, or inserted to indicate to what class or material objects belong;
        also the 'numeral terminations' affixed to the ordinal numbers to indicate the
        nature of the objects counted; the negative, diminutive, and amplificative
        particles which convey certain conceptions of a general character,*** but are
        generally not words themselves, having no independent status in the language.","[281, 282]"
"7.4      Role of morphology
Morphology plays a more prominent role in polysynthetic languages than syntagmatic
rules on the clause level, as word forms are highly complex and encode syntactic rela­
tions within them. From a syntagmatic perspective, however, these word forms tend to
be controlled by pragmatics rather than by syntax. This is especially true of languages
like Cayuga in which, except for particles and some simplex 'nouns', all word forms are
predicative (cf. Sasse 1993:203-204), and their interrelations in discourse entities which
are translated as sentences into English are clause-like, not constituent-like.
         Polysynthetic languages, e.g. in the Americas, are head-marking (in the sense of
Nichols 1986), contain a rich inventory of non-root bound morphemes, such as Green-
landic (Eskimo; see Fortescue 1980), Klamath (see Barker 1964), Slave (Athapaskan;
see Rice 1989), Tarasco (see Foster 1969), Capanawa (Panoan; see Loos 1999 ms.).
These affixes tend to have fairly concrete meanings, represented by lexical morphemes
in more analytic languages (compare e.g. the semantics of the Greenlandic suffixes,
Fortescue 1980:274-278; see (66) of chapter 6.4 and table 9.1 of chapter 9.1). Further­
more, the already weak distinction between derivational and inflectional morphology in
polysynthetic languages is further blurred by the fact that obligatory categories are
marked closer to the root than derivational ones (Fortescue 1994:2601).
         Nivkh is a head-marking language, in line with Fortescue's postulation about
polysynthetic languages (1994:2601, point (i)), but not a non-configurational one. The
asymmetry between the free subject constituent and the synthesizing object, together
with the fact that undergoer marking is obligatory and that the non-discontinuous object-
verb-complex is permuted, questioned and substituted as a whole (see chapter 3.8), are
good arguments in favor of the existence of a VP and of configurationality. Configura-
tionality contradicts Fortescue's postulation (h) (1994:2601), but as the combination of
214                   DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
head-marking and configurationality is obviously rare cross-linguistically1 (cf. Van Va-
lin 1985:406 vs. 1987:380), it is conspicuous in itself, not only in relation to polysynthe-
sis.
         Interestingly, Nivkh exhibits exactly (see chapters 2, 3.8, 4.1) the ""productive
morphophonemic processes resulting in several allomorphs (phonological shapes) for
both lexical stems and bound morphemes"", Fortescue's criterion (g) for polysynthesis
traits (1994:2601; cf. also Mithun 1988:442). In this, Nivkh resembles, for instance,
Greenlandic.
         As opposed to languages such as Greenlandic and Klamath, Nivkh has a compa­
ratively small set of non-root bound morphemes, viz. for aspectoid (seven suffixes), de­
gree (three suffixes), modality (eleven suffixes), scalar and focal (at least seven suffixes
on the verb root), as well as numeral (five suffixes) and locational categories (twelve
morphemes), but these affixes do fulfill the criterion of having a ""fairly concrete
meaning"" (cf. chapters 1.3.4, 6.4). Besides, they outnumber the corresponding category
of suffixes in Chukchi, see chapter 10.2.1.","[224, 225]"
"5.1       Parallels of dependent-head synthesis in Nivkh to noun incorporation
In Nivkh noun-verb complexes, a lexical noun stem and a lexical verb stem are com­
bined productively to form one single word, which may be the finite predicate. The noun
represents an undergoer of the verb which is the patient/theme, standard of comparison,
or location of transitive verbs and the goal of some ditransitive verbs (see chapter 4.2.2).
In addition, 'subjects' of intransitive verbs may be incorporated if they are body parts, or
if the verb expresses a quantity, color, value, or dimension (""long"", ""big"", see chapter
4.2.1); they may alternatively be interpreted as locations rather than subjects. Only one
participant at a time forms a complex with its verb. The noun-verb complex may be
paraphrased analytically for pragmatic reasons. Thus far, Nivkh dependent-head synthe­
sis is in line with approaches to incorporation (Sapir 1911; Gerdts 1996; Mithun 1984,
Mithun/Corbett 1999; de Reuse 1994b; Baker 1988). Only Rosen (1989) excludes goal
relations from being incorporated, whereas Hagège (1980) includes them. Neither of
them furnishes details. Goal incorporation is extant, however, for instance in Chukchi
(see Spencer 1995:458, 481), Southern Tiwa (Tanoan; Allen/Gardiner/Frantz 1984),
Kiowa (Kiowa-Tanoan; Watkins 1984:227), and Bininj Gun-wok (Gunwinjguan; see
Evans 1996:73, 75).
          Further characteristics are not as easy to decide on. A point of debate which be­
gan with Sapir (1911) is the linguistic level on which incorporation takes place, i.e.
whether incorporation is a morphological, word-formation process (Sapir 1911, Mithun
172                    DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
1984, Mithun/Corbett 1999; Rosen 1989) or a syntactic mechanism (Sadock 1980,1985,
1986; Baker 1988, 1996). The discussion between Mithun and Sadock on this point has
suffered from two shortcomings: first, the idea held by Mithun that morphological for­
mation of word-units implies lexicalization (1984, Mithun/Corbett 1999; see chapter
3.8); and second, the fact that the linguistic traits which motivated the recognition of
incorporation as a syntactic mechanism by Sadock, such as modifier stranding, have
been shown so far to be true only of Greenlandic1, which has denominal verbs only and
no nominal incorporation. Thus the syntactic mechanism postulated by Sadock may be
more adequately ascribed to denominal verb formation and is therefore not necessarily
valid for Nivkh. Compare an example from Japanese, which has denominal verbs as well
as modifier stranding:(6)     Japanese           (Martin 1988:105)

        ""it is my dream to make my garden into a mass of pretty flowers"" (lit.
        ""make it nice flower-full"")Kirei-na hana ""pretty flowers"" is an NP, kirei-na an attributive form only (adverb: kirei-
ni, converb: kirei-de), and -darake a non-root bound morpheme deriving a special sub­
class of adjectives (which are themselves a verbal subclass; cf. Mattissen 1995).
         On the other hand, it has already been shown in chapter 3.8 for German ad hoc
word formations that word formation does not entail lexicalization (pace Mithun); Ma-
jewicz (1980:140) claims that both incorporation and polysynthesis form words ad hoc.
Even Baker (1995, 1996) distinguishes between lexical and syntactic incorporation, al­
though his classificatory criteria lead to conflicting results. So the basic question concer­
ning the level on which incorporation takes place is still undecided. It is even unclear
whether the question is adequately posed in this form. In Nivkh, based on the evidence
presented in chapter 3, the noun and verb synthesize ad hoc on the morphological level
without necessarily being lexicalized.
         On the semantic level, a distinction between incorporation denoting ""permanent
or general activity"" and ""predicating a single act"" is made by Sapir (1911:259), a point
which has not been elaborated upon in subsequent incorporation models. Some studies
mention that noun incorporation in their respective languages is used for habitual or
projective events (e.g. Sullivan 1984 on Yucatec Maya, Rigsby 1975:349 on Nass-Git-
ksan (Tsimshian)); however it seems unreasonable to assume that, in languages where1
  The phenomena claimed to be modifier stranding in Mohawk and Southern Tiwa (Mithun 1986,
Baker 1988,1996) seem to be equal in translational effect but different in construction, since the
'modifiers' are full-fledged predicative forms (cf. Sasse 1993).
                         NOUN INCORPORATION IN NIVKH ?                                 173
incorporation is obligatory for nouns of a certain animacy, control (e.g. in Southern
Tiwa, see Allen/Gardiner/Frantz 1984, or Koyukon (Athapaskan) non-intentional actors,
cf. Axelrod 1990) or discourse status (non-human singular nouns in Southern Tiwa are
obligatorily incorporated if they are not modified or determined, see Allen/Gardiner/
Frantz 1984), incorporation should be confined to expressing habitual events. This
means that a non-modified non-human singular noun could not occur as the participant
of a particular event in Southern Tiwa at all. In Nivkh, noun-verb synthesis is fully pro­
ductive and may encode both habitual and particular states of affairs.
         As incorporation is not yet well defined with respect to morphological level and
semantics, the Nivkh phenomenon cannot be readily distinguished from it.","[182, 183, 184]"
"10.2     Basic structural types of polysynthesis - an attempt at a classification
As there is no accepted definition of polysynthesis, and polysynthesis in the traditional
sense is a 'feeling' rather than a clear-cut class, we have to compare Nivkh to the lan­
guages which make a polysynthetic impression in a heuristic approach according to the
parameters listed in chapter 7. In the same chapter, we already alluded to the heteroge­
neity of such languages. It has led Fortescue to set up a first classification of different
types of polysynthesis as follows (1994:2602)1:
         (a) pure incorporating (Chukchi, Onondaga)
         (b) recursive affixing (West Greenlandic, Yupik)
         (c) field-affixing (Atsugewa, Kalispel)
         (d) mixed 1+3 (Koyukon)
         (e) mixed 2+3 (Kwakwala)
         (f) mixed 1+2 (Nahuatl).
         Based on an examination of approximately 75 languages, we will rearrange and
modify this classification somewhat, restricting us to verbal polysynthesis for the
moment.2
First, based on the catalogue of polysynthesis traits (by Mithun 1988, Fortescue 1994,
and Drossard 1997; see chapter 7), I use the following set of formal and semantic criteria
for polysynthesis:(3)      A language is acknowledged to be polysynthetic because of
(i)      the existence of complex, polymorphemic verb forms which allow, within one
         word unit, for components in the form of non-root bound morphemes with quite
         'lexical' meaning or optionally for the concatenation of lexical roots;
1
  The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are obviously meant to refer to the small letters (a), (b), and (c) by
Fortescue.
2
  In order to assess these languages, I had to rely on grammars that varied in their extent of detail.
It may well be that the classification reached in this study will need future correction because
relevant information on the classificatory parameters used here was misinterpreted or is not expli­
citly or unambiguously mentioned in the grammars consulted. When there was any doubt, the
language in question was left out of the classification.

(ii)    these components express several of the following categories: event or partici­
        pant classification and quantification, setting (e.g. ""in the night""), location or di­
        rection, motion, instrument (e.g. ""by hand""), manner (""by pulling"", ""quickly""),
        modality (including evidentiality), degree, scale (""only"", ""also"") and focus,
        chronology (e.g. ""first"", ""again""), as well as the usual categories such as va­
        lence, voice, central participants, tense, aspect (phase), mood, and polarity.","[287, 288]"

        ""he cannot climb that high mountain""Note that it is the recipient or goal of ditransitive verbs that synthesizes with the verb,
not the patient. Possessors may be of prefixai, pronominal or nominal form, attributes of
nominal, verbal or clausal form, and undergoers of prefixai, pronominal, nominal or
clausal form in a complex noun or verb form. Relative clauses, on the other hand, do not
exist. Units of synthesized dependent and head will be called 'complexes' henceforth.
Such complexes are single words (as will be shown in chapter 3), but they are not lexica-
lized items. They are formed productively and ad hoc. They are not restricted in their
combinatory potential (except for semantic compatibilities), but are restricted in their in­
ternal form. There are four basic types of dependent-head complexes:
(i)      noun stem + noun, with the first noun modifying the second one or being its
         possessor,
(ii)     verb stem + noun, with the verb modifying the noun,
(iii)    noun stem + verb, with the noun being an undergoer of the verb, and
(iv)     verb stem + verb.
34                    DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
Thus a complex is a synthetic unit consisting of at least one head constituent and one
dependent constituent. The basic complexes may be enlarged by recursively substituting
a simple dependent (noun or verb form) for a complex one of which the same category
is the head. The verb + verb construction will be treated separately in chapter 6; the other
types are described in detail in chapters 2, 3, 4 and 8.
         Although modifier+modified and object+verb coalescence has already been
identified by Krejnovič and Panfilov, who discussed the status of the construction with
respect to incorporation (see chapter 3.1), the phenomenon has not been systematized,
the pervasiveness of the principle within Nivkh grammar has never been treated in any
detail, and the question of its syntactic and typological relevance has not been settled.
The present study tries to fill these gaps.
         I will now proceed to the prerequisites for the recognition of complexes, namely
Nivkh phonology and morphophonemics.
                                               CHAPTER 2
              NIVKH PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONEMICS
Nivkh is rich in morphophonemic processes, which, because of their pervasiveness and
functionality with respect to dependent-head synthesis, deserve a detailed exposition.
The most important ones are the alternations of initial and final consonant sounds at the
boundaries of adjacent lexical and/or grammatical morphemes.","[44, 45, 46]"
"10.2.1 Affixal and compositional polysynthesis
The application of these parameters to the languages in question results in different for-
mational types with two extremes, either
(i)      languages which use non-root bound morphemes for all of the above-mentioned
         categories in catalogue (3) and allow only one root per verb complex, which we
         will henceforth call the affixal strategy, or
(ii)     languages which ad hoc combine more than one lexical root in a verb form to
         attain a polysynthetic verb form, called the compositional strategy.
'Affixal' and 'compositional' have been chosen here as handy terms for the phenomena,
based on the terminology for the mechanisms of word formation. The former strategy is
not generally inflectional since most affixes are not obligatory, nor do they represent in-
282                   DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
flectional categories. They are fully productive and marked on the verb ad hoc, so their
status is actually somewhere in the grey area between derivation and inflection. Affixal
and compositional poly synthesis are not complementary types: affixes (non-root bound
morphemes) are a necessary condition for the recognition of poly synthesis.
         Before proceeding to a finer-grained classification, let us consider an example of
both types: Greenlandic, an affixally polysynthetic language, and Chukchi, a composi-
tionally polysynthetic one.
          Greenlandic (Eskimo-Aleut; Fortescue 1984) allows only one root morpheme
per word form (in the initial position) while all other categories are expressed using non-
root bound morphemes or the final inflectional suffix (for mood and person). Fortescue
(1990:321-332) lists 262 suffixes that are non-root bound morphemes and which express
categories from the catalogue (excluding category-changing, nominal affixes and inflec­
tion; see also (66) in chapter 6.4 and table 9.1 in chapter 9.1). Noun incorporation and
verb root serialization are absent in Greenlandic. There are, however, denominal verbs
(formed from lexical noun roots with verbalizing suffixes).","[292, 293]"
"8.9       Conclusion
As the preceding sections have shown, there is a nominal complex in Nivkh which
parallels the verbal complex. The general principle for the noun complex structure, ana­
logous to the verb complex, is that adjacent elements in a dependent-head relation syn­
thesize; thus the Nivkh noun is head-marked as well. The nominal complex may contain
determiners, possessors, different kinds of attributes (nominal, verbal, quantificational),
and relational morphemes. Again, possessors and attributes may be roots, but may also
248                   DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
be inflected for all categories except case, focus, mood or converb.
         Moreover, the synthesizing non-head elements may be proper names, personal,
demonstrative or interrogative pronouns, or interrogative verbs. Excluded from integra­
tion into the complex are adverbial material and non-last coordinated elements.
         It is important to note that synthesization in the nominal complex is absolutely
parallel to synthesization in the verbal complex, subject to the same morphophonological
rules. Therefore, if we accept the existence of a verbal complex, with its similarities to
noun incorporation, we have to accept the existence of a nominal complex as well. This
principle is also stressed by Krejnovic (1934, 1937). With determiners, possessors, and
attributes being integrated into a single nominal complex, the whole complex contains
components which form noun phrases in other languages. We may thus say that the com­
plexes resulting from dependent-head synthesis in Nivkh, both verbal and nominal, cor­
respond to phrases in more analytic languages and are 'word-phrases' in that sense.
         If the Nivkh verb complex is thought to be polysynthetic, however, and the
Nivkh noun complex parallels it in complexity and in evidence for wordhood, are we
then dealing with polysynthetic nouns in Nivkh? We will concern ourselves with this
question in the next chapter after studying complex noun word forms in a preliminary
cross-linguistic overview.
                       CHAPTER 9
      COMPLEX NOUN FORMS IN THE WORLD'S L A N G U A G E S
To my knowledge, a typological study of complex noun forms has not been carried out
thus far, nor has a comparison of nominais in polysynthetic languages been made. In this
chapter we will concentrate on an intersection of the two, viz. complex noun forms in
polysynthetic languages. Against this background, the Nivkh phenomenon may be better
assessed.
         A first difficulty which arises with nouns in polysynthetic languages is that there
may not be such a class, or, if there is, only a small one (as has been described for Salish
languages (see Kinkade 1983), Wakashan (Jacobsen 1979), Cayuga (Iroquoian; Sasse
 1993), etc.). Instead, translation equivalents to nouns in European languages are roots
forming predicative expressions which are distinguished from 'verbal' predicates by a
restricted paradigm, e.g. in terms of aspectual and person inflection (Sasse 1993:209-
210). To avoid false predictions connected with this problem, the languages examined in
the present sample were chosen because of the existence of a lexical category which also
forms non-predicative expressions. Generally, such nouns bear possessor markers (see
also Fortescue 1994:2601) and a few case or 'adpositional' affixes. They may also be­
come quite complex in some languages by either accumulating non-root bound mor­
phemes on the nominal root or by concatenating roots. In this chapter, examples for both
types will be presented.","[258, 259, 260]"

"4.5     Conclusion
This chapter has presented formal (based on the initial sound(s) and ablauting vowels)
and valence subclasses of the verb in Nivkh, and the noun+verb complex. It was shown
that the primary object relation in Nivkh is encoded by dependent-head synthesis of the
undergoer and the verb, evidenced by morphophonemic alternations signalling the syn­
tactic relation in the absence of central case marking. The patient of mono transitive and
the recipient or goal of ditransitive verbs may be marked on the verb in the form of a
prefix (singular persons, reflexive, reciprocal) or a non-singular personal pronoun or
noun, the marking being obligatory. In other words, the primary object is a dependent
which its head in fact requires, contrary to what Nichols (1986:108) predicts.
168                   DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
Secondary objects (the patient of ditransitive verbs) are free constituents which are never
marked on the verb.
         The undergoer-verb complex may be dissolved under certain syntactic condi­
tions. The lexico-morphological status of a noun, however, does not cause such a disso­
lution: noun roots inflected for number, scalar operator, or relational morpheme (but ne­
ver for case or focus) synthesize to their governing verb, as do proper names, non-singu­
lar personal, demonstrative and interrogative pronouns, and nominalizations.
         If two or more undergoers are coordinated, each one bears the associative mar­
ker and the last item synthesizes to its governing verb; all others are phonological words
outside (and preceding) the complex.
         If the undergoer is topicalized, dislocated, or focused or if any other constituent
is focused, the undergoer-verb complex is dissolved, i.e. the undergoer appears in the
clause-initial position while a prefix takes its place on the verb. Any focused constituent
other than the undergoer is found in the immediate pre-verbal position. Complex dissolu­
tion also occurs under resultative or reciprocal formation or under the demotion of a par­
ticipant of a ditransitive verb.
         Demotion of the primary object does not lead to the promotion of another parti­
cipant, however. Instead, the undergoer prefix is found on the verb. Demotion of or re­
sultative formation to the secondary object does not change relations otherwise.
         Thus, the dissolution of a complex is a systematic mechanism occurring under
well-defined syntactic and pragmatic conditions, and not an arbitrary or a sheer surface
phenomenon, as Panfilov believed (1960a, 1966). The question of whether Nivkh noun-
verb-synthesization constitutes a case of noun incorporation will be tackled in the
following chapter.

    Except for nominalization incorporation in Spokane (Carlson 1990).
                     NIVKH - A POLYSYNTHETIC LANGUAGE ?                                219
With respect to the last point, we can specify that nominal material is integrated in the
form of lexical noun roots (not affixes like in Quileute or Spokane) into a lexical verb
form (and that noun roots are not verbalized as in Eskimo) which corresponds to
Drossard's type C3, represented by Takelma and Chukchi.
          The peculiarity of Nivkh within this classification, however, is that whereas
some of the necessary categories are encoded via non-root bound morphemes on the
verb, it is the basic structural principle of dependent-head synthesis which chiefly contri­
butes to the complexity of a Nivkh verb form through the integration of lexical roots,
whether they represent nominal material (undergoers in the case of Nivkh) or adverbial
material (manner or location). The question is whether this structural principle is an in­
stance of polysynthesis or of something different.
          We will return to this point in the last chapter, after an examination of Nivkh
nominais. As polysynthesis is understood to be a phenomenon rotating around the verbal
complex only, dependent-head synthesis stands out against it as being operative in the
nominal complex as well.
                              CHAPTER 8
                     THE NIVKH NOMINAL COMPLEX
In the previous chapters, we examined complex verb forms in Nivkh with respect to
noun incorporation and polysynthesis. Nivkh seems to be unique in the form its no­
minals take, since not only verbs but also nouns may become complex units.
          Several chapters already alluded to the existence of the two complex types
headed by a noun, the noun + noun and the verb + noun complex (see chapter 1.3.7).
The former type is used for constructions of possessor and possessee or nominal attribute
and head, the latter type for verbal attribute and head. These complexes with nouns as
heads are accentual, pitch and pause units (see chapter 3.4), with the same morphopho-
nemic mechanisms, especially consonant alternation, active between their components
like they are between components of a verb-headed complex (see chapter 2). They are
not lexicalized compound nouns, but are formed ad hoc and freely according to a pro­
ductive pattern with a fully transparent meaning. Within such a complex, there are fixed
slots for its components, and the direction of modification is rigid as well. The complex
is inflected and permuted in a clause as a whole. On the other hand, there is no possessor
case, attribute marker or linker in Nivkh. In other words, we are dealing with an equally
strong dependent-head synthesis in nominal as in verbal complexes, signalling a modi­
fier-modified relation in the absence of case or other marking.
          Unlike a noun complex, apposition exists as a different and rather marginal con­
struction type. A simple example will illustrate the difference between an apposition and
a possessor construction.","[229, 230, 231]"
"Non-root bound morphemes with 'quite lexical meaning' are understood to be affixes
with meanings which would be expressed by independent forms, especially lexical roots,
in more analytic languages. Polypersonalism, in conjunction with the discussion in chap­
ter 7.1 and in line with Boas (1911a) and Drossard (1997), is not considered a necessary
condition here. A language with TAM, polarity markers, polypersonalism and valence-
related morphology on the verb is not considered polysynthetic if no other categories
from the catalogue can be marked on the verb.
          When examining languages which fulfill these criteria we observe that quite dif­
ferent sets of criteria apply out of the pool of ingredients and that the categories in (3),
such as central participants, instrument, quantification, location/direction/motion, moda­
lity, manner, chronology, and phase, may be encoded in basically two different forms:
either as lexical morphemes, which are understood to be roots, i.e. forming word forms
on their own outside of a larger complex, or as non-root bound morphemes. Participants
(except person marking), classifiers, instruments, and location encoded by non-root
bound morphemes on a lexical verb root are usually termed 'lexical affixes' or 'field-
affixes'.
          Lexical morphemes, depending on the number of lexical categories that are di­
stinguished in a language, may be nominal, verbal, adjectival stems, adverbs or even ad-
positions. In most of the languages in question, however, only noun and verb roots seem
to be involved. The morphological and phonological integration of a (lexical) noun root
into a verb complex then is known as noun incorporation (cf. Gerdts 1996). The morpho­
logical and phonological integration of an additional verb root into a verb complex cor­
responds to verb root serialization (see Bisang 1995).
          At this point, it is important that an essential distinction be drawn. Noun incor­
poration and verb root serialization are phenomena which are independent of one
another and of poly synthesis. Languages that have either
 (i)      noun incorporation alone (e.g. Danish, Dutch and Frisian (Weggelaar 1986)) or
 (ii)     verb root serialization alone (e.g. Yamphu (Kiranti; Rutgers 1998), Yuchi
          (North America; Mithun 1999:571-573))
without further polysynthetic traits included in the above-mentioned catalogue (e.g. loca-
tional affixes) are not considered polysynthetic. Noun incorporation and verb root seria­
 lization contribute to the polysynthetic character of a language, however, and it seems
that most noun incorporating languages are indeed polysynthetic, since non-polysynthe-
tic noun incorporating languages are not so easy to find.
          The third possibility, languages with both noun incorporation and verb root se­
 rialization, is more difficult to decide on, as both mechanisms together lead to fairly
278                   DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
complex verb forms, even leaving the additional criteria aside. Yucatec Maya, for in­
stance, manifests noun incorporation, polypersonalism and suffixes for aspect and va­
lence-changing categories, but quantificational, chronological or manner material seems
to-be integrated into the verb via verb root serialization only (or possibly via adjective
incorporation), not in the form of affixes (cf. Blair 1964:65, Bricker/Po?ot Yah/Dzul de
Po?ot 1998). According to the criteria in (3), Yucatec is a borderline case. It lacks non-
root bound morphemes with fairly 'lexical' meaning, but verb root serialization may be
considered a sort of compensation for that, as categories out of the catalogue (quantifica­
tion, manner, chronology) are expressed this way.
         Swedish is a similar case, with noun and adjective incorporation as well as verb
root serialization. Adjectives integrated into the verb form also express degree and chro­
nology.","[288, 289]"

the polysynthetic verb form in the form of optional suffixes. The morphemes number in
the hundreds and have quite concrete meanings, but a lexical source cannot be recon­
structed for them (see Fortescue 1992a:245). Here are some suffixes, including the se­
mantic domains Nivkh expresses with verb root serialization and modals:

 in a serial root construction, lost connection to their sources to different degrees (we do
 not know how old the different modals are) and underwent further changes until some
 reached a state comparable to the Greenlandic non-root bound morphemes. The greatest
 formal change has occurred in -yzu-, the negative experiential and negative habitual. It
 has lost phonological substance and become bound in comparison to its source verb
j-әyzu-a1 ""s.o. ignores sth."", and it has developed its own allomorphy -yzu- ~ -ksu- ~ -xsu-
 (in line with the usual consonant alternation and parallel to the completive -yet-, for
 example).
          In terms of semantics, there is a change from jdyzua1 ""ignore"" via ""not know how
 to V"" (with a verbal complement) to Negative Experiential (""never have V-ed"") and fi­
 nally to Negative Habitual. In East Sakhalin, it is even close to a simple negation marker.

        shell             of-bishop     large
        ""large shell of the bishop""  (kįkóloombe ""shell"")The common denominator of these examples of sandhi phenomena (as they are called)
seems to be that they are defined with respect to a word boundary (Hooper 1976:17,
Clayton 1981, see e.g. the contributions in Andersen 1986). This introduces the first re­
levant parameter, viz. the domain in which sandhi applies. Sandhi phenomena have been
described in domains ranging from the word via the phrase to the sentence and even
across sentence boundaries (such as the English linking-r, Vogel 1986).
          If we restrict sandhi to a morphophonemic process applying across a word boun­
dary, as Ternes (1986:14-16) proposes, the identification of word boundaries must pre­
cede the recognition of sandhi. For Nivkh this would mean that we would have to prove
independently where the word boundaries are. The question still remains though: which
boundaries count, the phonological word boundaries or the morphological ones?
          The original phenomenon for which the term 'sandhi' was coined in Sanskrit is
observed both within words as well as across word boundaries, known as internal and
external sandhi (cf. Ternes 1986:11). The actual processes consist of different pheno­
mena such as voicing or vowel hiatus elimination, but are largely identical for internal
and external sandhi (Bucknell 1994:5). Furthermore, the fact that identical sandhi pro­
cesses occur both within a word and across a word boundary is not unique to Sanskrit:
this also occurs with, for instance, the English linking-r (Vogel 1986) and Italian Gorgia
Toscana (Nespor/Vogel 1982:238). Phenomena such as these seem to have inspired
Basbøll's claim that the ""boundaries surrounding a non-phonologically defined word
have no special status with respect to sandhi"" (1986:24).
          With this in mind, the status of Nivkh complexes remains hard to determine,
since the consonant alternations in Nivkh apply, as we saw in sections 3.3 and 3.3.1, at
inflectional boundaries, i.e. word-internally, as well. Nivkh cannot be said to lack a
phonetic word boundary, as Ternes (1986:20) proposes for Spanish with respect to its
voicing of any intervocalic stops. The final devoicing of fricatives and the restriction to
initial clusters of at most two consonants establishes such a phonetic word boundary in
Nivkh. The boundaries between the elements of complexes could thus be word-internal,
paralleling inflection, or could be found between words. In the latter case, consonant
alternations would be sandhi occurring both word-internally and across word bounda­
ries, but only across 'words' without finite or case inflection and in a syntactically well-
defined relation to one another. These relations roughly define domains which are
phrases in European languages. Otherwise there are not any morphophonemic processes
96                    DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
in Nivkh occurring in domains larger than the complex, e.g. after discourse markers,
case-marked nouns, mood-marked verbs, converbs, between subject and predicate, or
between adverbials and anything preceding or following them. This is worth noting if it
is taken into account that sandhi phenomena which have been described as applying
within phrases, e.g. Italian raddoppiamento sintattico, also occur across phrases (see
Nespor/Vogel 1986:38-40,165-174). Suspending a conclusion for the moment, we turn
to further parameters describing sandhi phenomena.
          A second parameter concerns the obligatoriness of morphophonemic processes.
Both obligatory processes, such as Sanskrit sandhi, as well as register-dependent (e.g.
English linking-r, Vogel 1986:60pp) or speech rate-dependent ones are subsumed under
the term sandhi. One sandhi phenomenon can even be both obligatory and optional
under different conditions, e.g. French liaison (see below) or Danish nasal alternation,
which is obligatory on the syllabic and morphemic levels, but register-dependent on the
utterance level (Basbøll 1986:23). In Nivkh, all morphophonemic processes are obligato­
ry, and not dependent on the speaker or the occasion.
          Further, sandhi may be conditioned phonologically only, as in Sanskrit, where
it applies in any syntactic constellation with only a handful of minor exceptions (see
Bucknell 1994:4); morphologically or syntactically only (e.g. Kimatuumbi vowel shorte­
ning of the phrasal head, Odden 1987; Welsh mutations, Ball/Müller 1992); or both pho­
nologically and morphologically/syntactically, e.g. Italian raddoppiamento sintattico
(Nespor/Vogel 1982). Nivkh consonant alternation is conditioned by both the phonologi­
cal (final and initial sound constellations) and the syntactic context (undergoer-verb, at­
tribute-noun, possessor-noun).
          Finally, whereas most sandhi processes occur under adjacency of the target and
trigger, Welsh mutations, which are termed sandhi, occur under both adjacency and non-
adjacency (syntactic triggers). With respect to this criterion, Nivkh consonant alterna­
tions occur strictly under adjacency.
          Besides these defining parameters, the actual morphophonemic processes recog­
nized as sandhi are quite heterogeneous. Among them are assimilation (Sanskrit), vowel
harmony (e.g. in Hungarian), elision (French), epenthesis (French liaison, English lin­
king-r), resyllabification (French enchaînement), lenition (Gorgia Toscana, Welsh muta­
tions), fortition of segments (Welsh word-internal mutations) and also of suprasegmen-
tals, e.g. tone sandhi in Chinese (Chen 1987).
          These varied features make sandhi a very vague concept, or rather a melting pot.
In view of the variety of the phenomena, a more concise classification is missed if all of
 them are subsumed under the one term sandhi which conceals their status and functiona­
 lity. While Kimatuumbi vowel shortening seems to be a strict phrase marker, Welsh mu­
tations are not consistently so, and Italian raddoppiamento sintattico is consistent within
phrases, but also applies between constituents of different phrases (Nespor/Vogel 1986:
 228). English linking-r and Sanskrit sandhi, on the other hand, obviously do not define
 syntactic units.
          A case in point is the French liaison, which at first seems to bear a resemblance
 to Nivkh in that it leads to a coalescence of independent words in a phrase. However, a
                 DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD                                   97
distinction is to be made in French between environments in which liaison (and analo­
gously, enchaînement) is obligatory, optional or impossible; furthermore, liaison (conso­
nant epenthesis), enchaînement (resyllabification), and vowel elision complement one
another in a common functionality, a fact which is not of interest to a number of studies
concerning French (see for example De Jong 1990, Klausenburger 1974:175, Kaisse
1985:162-168).
         Liaison, enchaînement, and elision are obligatory in two environments (ignoring
frozen expressions): (i) between the determiner (articles; several indefinite determiners;
possessive, demonstrative, and interrogative adjectives; quantifiers; and numerals (De
Jong 1990:79)) and the following element (modifier or head), and (ii) with pronominal
markers directly preceding or following the verb as well as with the negation marker on
the verb (cf. Malécot 1975:163-166). In both cases, all three mechanisms operate on dif­
ferent forms constituting one paradigm, as exemplified below.","[106, 107, 108]"

This thesis was accepted as a doctoral dissertation by the Philosophische Fakultät of the
University of Cologne, Germany in Summer 2001.
While writing it, I have profited from the support of many people. First of all, I would
like to express my gratitude to Hidetoshi Shiraishi and Svetlana Filimonovna Polet'eva.
Hidetoshi Shiraishi so very kindly conducted field work for me, too, during his own
research trip. From the materials I sent him, he wrote filing cards, did the interviews with
the consultant and recorded and documented the spoken language. Svetlana Polet'eva
kindly read out the materials on the cards. I am very much obliged to both of them for
the pains they took and time they sacrificed on my behalf.
I am very grateful to Hans-Jürgen Sasse and Elisabeth Löbel, my supervisors, for their
valuable comments, and to the other members of my doctoral committee, Franziska
Ehmcke, Ursula Stephany, Fritz Serzisko, and Frank Heidermanns. Hans-Jürgen Sasse
let me work on Nivkh freely within the parameters of the projects on lexical categories
and polysynthesis. It was through Werner Drossard's structural course, however, that I
first came to be interested in Nivkh.
My work profited greatly from discussions with and comments by Daniel Abondolo,
Christoph Benden, Bernard Comrie, William Foley, Ekaterina Jur'evna Gruzdeva, Tôru
Kaneko, Martin Haspelmath, Siri Tuttle and several audiences in Cologne, Leipzig,
Zurich, Tübingen, Leuven, and Berlin, for all of which I am really thankful. A thousand
thanks to Tarek Ahmed, Antje Casaretto, Michael Dunn, Mats Exter, Sevim Genç,
Claudia Leto, Andreas Mühlhäusler, Tomiko Murata and Georg Sachse for sharing their
expertise in Swedish, Sanskrit, Chukchi, Laz, Wichita, Japanese and phonetics with me.
Also, I appreciated so much that Hiroshi Nakagawa shared his materials with me and
introduced me to the Japanese community of Nivkh linguists. Elena Skribnik sent me
papers from Russia that I could not get ahold of here, and Carmen Dawuda showed me
the audio software which was really helpful.
To Pamela Perniss and Aria Jackson I am greatly indebted for correcting my English. I
lived through the whole thing thanks to Karsten Piaszenski's support, both moral and
technical.
Finally, I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Deutsche Forschungsge­
meinschaft (DFG). It funded the project on ""Lexikalische Kategorien und Argumentlin-
king in polysynthetischen Sprachen"" [Lexical categories and argument linking in po­
lysynthetic languages] as part of the special research program SFB 282 ""Theorie des Le­
xikons"" [Theory of the Lexicon] I have been working on during the writing of this
thesis.
                                     CHAPTER 1
                                  INTRODUCTION
1.1      The aim of this study
Determining which morphological type a language exhibits does not seem to pose too
many difficulties, especially as the catalogue of types is a fairly fixed and widely agreed
upon entity in linguistics. Nevertheless, languages may, upon closer examination,
challenge the established order in that they manifest a synthetic organization of a quality
not covered by the traditional types of isolating, agglutinating, fusional, root-inflecting,
and polysynthetic languages.
         One such language is Nivkh (also known as Gilyak), which stands out from
other languages because of its highly complex word forms of both verbs and nouns.
They are formed from the fully-productive and ad hoc concatenation of lexical roots
which stand in fixed relationships of dependent and head (in the sense of Nichols 1986)
to each other. These complex word forms represent either the most common or even the
only way of encoding the syntactic relations of undergoer / verb and modifier / noun or
verb, in the absence of any morphology specifying the precise kind of the relation within
a complex form.
         There are various morphological synthesis phenomena in linguistics - one or
more of which Nivkh could instantiate - viz. noun incorporation, a construction type
concatenating noun and verb, as has been described by Sapir (1911), Mithun (1984,
1994), Baker (1988,1996), Rosen (1989), de Reuse (1994b), and Gerdts (1996) (to name
only the broadest approaches). Furthermore there are verb root serialization (the
concatenation of more than one verb root in one verbal word form; Bisang 1995), and
polysynthesis (Mithun 1988, Fortescue 1994, Baker 1996, Drossard 1997), which both
lead to complex word forms. Noun incorporation and verb root serialization, however,
focus on single domains of morphosyntax, whereas in Nivkh, one single principle domi­
nates the whole of morphosyntax. Polysynthesis is an organizational principle which en­
compasses a larger area of morphosyntax, but which comprises a range of heterogeneous
phenomena such as polypersonalism, noun incorporation, verb root serialization, deriva­
tion, and affixation.
         In contrast to this, a single homogeneous structural principle is active in Nivkh.
This principle consists of a systematic and consistent synthesis of heads and their
dependents under adjacency in the order dependent-head, both for modifier and modified
and for governee and governor, and leads to the complex word forms characteristic of
Nivkh.
         To my knowledge, such a structural principle of dependent-head synthesis has
not been described for any language heretofore, although any other languages which
could be adequately described by such a principle are of great typological interest. The
principle will be studied here by analyzing Nivkh construction types in detail, and its
2                    DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
affinity to noun incorporation, verb root serialization and different types of polysyn-
thesis, for which this study furnishes a systematization, will be discussed.
          Since not only verb forms but also noun forms manifest a complex structure in
Nivkh, they will be compared to complex noun structures in a range of (mostly polysyn-
thetic) languages. The classification of complex noun structures observed in the context
of different polysynthetic structures opens up a new perspective on the morphological
organization of languages, in particular an overall uniform formation principle domina­
ting several polysynthetic languages which has so far not been acknowledged in the ap­
proaches to polysynthesis. My study concludes with an assessment of the status of the
principle within morphology.
         The study is organized as follows: Chapter 1 furnishes an overview of the Nivkh
people and introduces an outline of Nivkh grammar, including the four basic moldings
of dependent-head synthesis, viz. the noun + verb, noun + noun, verb + noun, and verb
+ verb complexes, with which we will deal throughout this study. Chapter 2 gives a de­
tailed account of Nivkh morphophonemics, which dominate the morphosyntax of the
language and are instrumental in the identification of complexes. This prepares the way
for Chapter 3, which addresses the phonotactic, accentual, morphophonemic, morpholo­
gical, and psychological evidence for the wordhood of the different Nivkh complexes.
Chapter 4 is dedicated to the structure and use of the noun + verb complex; Chapter 5
examines its affinities to noun incorporation. Chapter 6 deals with the verb + verb com­
plex in Nivkh as an example of verb root serialization. Chapter 7 discusses the question
of whether Nivkh exhibits polysynthesis on the basis of the findings of Chapters 4
through 6. Chapter 8 is concerned with the structure and use of the nominal complex
(noun + noun and verb + noun complexes) in Nivkh, and Chapter 9 contains a cross-
linguistic study of complex noun forms, helping to assess the Nivkh phenomenon. The
final chapter presents a summary of the morphosyntactic structure of Nivkh, an attempt
at a typology of polysynthesis and an interpretation of the dependent-head synthesis in
Nivkh in light of this typology.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"
"6.4        The modal verb construction
Modalities are expressed in Nivkh either in auxiliary or complement constructions, with
suffixes, or in a construction which originated in verb root serialization. The latter form
is typical for deontic modality, and more specifically for negative modality and negation
itself in the Amur variety (whereas complement-taking modal verbs are both affirmative
and negative). It is fully productive and formed ad hoc, and the first verb root is not
subject to any restrictions. The modal verbs take the position of the second root. The

"3.6      Consonant alternations outside Nivkh
Morphophonemic processes called consonant alternation or mutation are reported in
Celtic languages and languages in West Africa, where they are incidentally termed san­
dhi. We will compare these phenomena to Nivkh in terms of their functionality.
         We have already looked at Welsh mutations above. From the point of view of
the phonological processes, Welsh mutations are quite similar to Nivkh. Four kinds of
mutations are distinguished in Welsh (Ball/Müller 1992:5):
1. Soft Mutation, which is actually lenition via voicing of/p, t, k, ɬ, ṛh (to /b, d, g, 1, r/),
spirantization of /b, d, m/ (to /v, ð, v/), and elision of /g/ (Ball/Müller 1992:12).
2. Nasal Mutation, which nasalizes the plosives /p, t, k, b, d, g/ (to /ṃh, ṇh, ŋh, m, n, ŋ/).
3. Aspirate Mutation of/p, t, k/ (to /f, θ, x/), which is lenition via spirantization.
These three types operate productively at the word boundary and are lexicalized word-
internally (Ball/Müller 1992:5).
4. Hard Mutation, which is fortition via devoicing and affects /b, d, g, v, ð/. Hard muta-
3
  Panfilov (1965:45) cites apparent exceptions. In some of these cases, however, he misses a topic
construction made up from topic, subject and intransitive verb, in which there is never alternation
(see chapters 1.3.7, 4.4.1), e.g. in
(i) mer         lumz       roi-ḍ
      1p.incl victuals not_suffice-IND/NML
      ""as for us, the victuals do not suffice""
In other cases, a probably denominal transitive verb begins with a non-alternating fricative (see
chapters 2.4.1, 2.1: fn. 2), e.g. vauḍ ""chew"", valvalḍ ""cut"" (cf. va ""sabre""), vayzaḍ ""s.o. stops up
sth."" (vay ""hemp"", zaḍ ""s.o. hits sth.""). The rest of the verbs appear in the dictionary as normally
alternating verbs (Savel'eva/Taksami 1970), e.g. fəvrkţ""s.o. plucks [feathers]"".

tion only occurs at morpheme boundaries within a word, not across word boundaries.
As we saw above, however, these alternations are not phonologically conditioned and
even occur under the non-adjacency of trigger and target word, which are both separate­
ly inflected. Thus the question of wordhood does not come up as it does in Nivkh.
          Consonant alternation is also common in the West-African Mande and Bantu
languages. In the Bantu language Fula, only initial plosives alternate with homorganic
continuants and nasals, but the alternations are not synchronically motivated phonologi­
cally. The initial sound of nouns changes depending on the suffix on that noun; for suffi­
xes, it changes depending on the stem they are attached to (cf. Skousen 1972). The alter­
nating initial sound of verbs now functions as a number agreement marker (cf.
Gottschligg 1995). The situation is obviously not comparable to Nivkh.
          In Mande languages, initial consonant change taking place under the adjacency
of trigger and target is obligatory, and both phonologically and syntactically condi­
tioned. Hence a comparison to Nivkh seems worthwhile.
          Let us consider two examples, Kpelle and Mende, which represent two subclas­
ses of alternation languages within Mande. In Kpelle (and Manya, Manessy 1964:165-
 168), a final nasal triggers alternation of a following initial non-nasal; in Mende, Loma
and Bandi, alternation takes place after a preceding final vowel, i.e. in the intervocalic
position.
          In Kpelle, the alternating consonants are non-nasal plosives and fricatives as in
Nivkh, but also glides and laterals (Bird 1971). Nasals and voiced obstruents (except for
Ibl and lyl) do not alternate. The initial voiceless plosives and fricatives of nouns, nume­
rals and verbs are voiced, and initial /b/, /y/ and sonorants change into a homorganic
nasal if they follow a syllable consisting of a syllabic nasal with a low tone.","[109, 110]"

word forms in Nivkh and is a valid criterion for morphological wordhood.
         Jakobson, like Krejnovič, considers the complexes (his 'syntactic sections') to
be stress and pause units (1971:78).
         Furthermore, in 1962, at the time when the question of incorporation in Nivkh
was being hotly debated by Krejnovič and Panfilov, Bondarko & Zinder examined com­
plex structures in Nivkh in phonetic experiments. They submitted 30 test sentences to
five native speakers each and evaluated the waveforms of the recordings. The test sen­
tences represent the following types of syntactic constructions:(i)     [subject predicate], e.g.
(32)        aŋ χa-ḍ
        who      shoot-IND/NML
        ""who shot it?""(ii)    [subject undergoer-verb-complex], e.g.

        ""whom did he shoot?""

        ""railway""(v)     [attributive noun-noun complex], e.g.
(37)    k'eq-zif
        fox-track
        ""fox('s) track""Their results, illustrated in part by waveforms, are as follows: In type (i) subject-predi­
cate constructions, ""both words have the same intensity"" (1962:85) [actually referring to
the amplitude instead of the intensity], i.e. the waveforms show two stretches of acoustic
signal, one for /aŋ/ ""who"" and one for /χaʤ/ ""s.o. shoots it"", with the amplitudes of the
two (identical) vowels being equal. In type (ii), with the assumed undergoer-verb com­
plex, there are three sections of which the first two, /if/ ""s/he"" and /aŋ/ ""who"", show
equal vowel amplitudes, while for the section /qhaʤ/ ""shoot"" the amplitude is clearly
lower. This pattern constitutes a regularity observed in all speakers, differing only in de­
gree (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85). The problematic point about this interpretation is that,
because the low-amplitudinal section is at the sentence boundary, it may represent a
sentence-final creaky voice phase.
          Bondarko & Zinder see their findings confirmed by an evaluation of the duration
of the vowels. In type (ii) constructions, the duration of the vowel of the verb forming a
complex with its undergoer is shorter than in the corresponding type (i) constructions
with the bare verb. For three speakers, the vowel of the 'non-incorporating' verb in type
(i) constructions was 1.5 to two times longer; the minimal difference of duration,
observed with a fourth informant, was 20 ms. This vowel reduction is not dependent on
the phonetic context of the utterance (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85). Amplitudinal and du­
rational differences, if accepted as significant, support Krejnovič's stress rule that in
noun + verb complexes, stress falls on the noun (see above).
          For constructions of both type (iv) (lexicalized noun compounds) and (v) (non-
lexicalized complexes), Bondarko & Zinder note a low amplitude for vowels in the
second element of both types in comparison to the same element as a simplex form, but
the overall difference is less clear-cut. The duration analysis, too, shows less consistent
and more ambiguous results (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85-89).
          In comparing type (ii) and type (iii) constructions, Bondarko & Zinder point out
that in ñivx ləyi-ŋəŋḍ ""man hunts salmon"", there are two amplitudinal maxima, one on
the /i/ of ñivx and one on the /a/ of ləyi (as is typical for construction type (ii)), whereas
                 DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD                                 89
in ləyi-ŋəŋ-ñivx ""man who hunts salmon"", there is only one, namely on the first /ə/
(1962:89).
         Bondarko & Zinder conclude from these results that independent word forms are
distinguishable from elements in word complexes. They also find that in word-comple­
xes, such as aŋ-q'aḍ ""s.o. shoots whom?"", two (or more) elements are ""fused into one
whole"", constituting a phonetic unit (Bondarko/Zinder 1962:85). This experimental re­
search supports Krejnovič's analysis of the Nivkh complexes as 'wholes'. It has not re­
ceived, however, much attention among Nivkhologists.
         Elaborating on this experimental basis, we will now proceed to an analysis of
Nivkh speech material. The speaker is a middle-aged Nivkh teacher of Nekrasovska
(North Sakhalin), whose linguistic background comprises North Sakhalin and Amur
Nivkh. She read out a sample of 55 different sentences (taken from the extant language
materials), which were written on cards, to the non-native speaker interviewer, repeating
each item about ten times in random order. On the cards, the modern conventional ortho­
graphy was used which follows Panfilov's tradition of writing as separate words as much
as possible. The speaker's articulation was clear and rather slow. The recordings were
analyzed digitally with regards to different parameters. For this presentation, a number
of the more complex sentences which illustrate different structural types of complexes
have been chosen, as well as inflected word forms and compounds.","[98, 99, 100]"
"3.1      The old dispute
The question of wordhood in Nivkh was first raised by Krejnovič (1934, 1937) and was
discussed in the 1950s and 1960s by the two Russian 'Nivkhologists' Krejnovič and
Panfilov in a series of articles dealing with ""incorporation in Nivkh"" (Krejnovič 1958,
1966;Panfilov 1954,1958,1960a, 1963,1966). Their dispute prompted phonetic experi­
ments carried out by Bondarko & Zinder (1962), but did not lead to any agreement.
         Panfilov's position, as it emerges from his articles and his grammar (1962:25-
33, 1965:23-30), is based on a morphosyntactic and semantic argumentation. Although
he does not contest the ""tight phonological units"" in Nivkh, pointed out by Bondarko
and Zinder (1962; their results will be taken up below), he considers these phonological
properties first not to be sufficient ( 1960a), later not to be decisive (1963:157), and final­
ly not even to be relevant (1965:27-28) for the recognition of word units. The word, in
his view, is neither a phonologically nor a morphologically defined entity, but a lexico-
grammatical unit (1963:27-28). As such, he continues, it is characterized, in contrast to
morphemes and components of compounds, by having a relatively autonomous meaning,
by being a member of a paradigm, and by contracting syntactic relations with other parts
of a sentence; and it is characterized by a semantic and syntactic integrity in contrast to
what he calls 'word unions'. His 'word unions' are our complexes of modifier + head
and undergoer + verb, which undergo consonant alternation as described in chapter 2.
The complexes are thus, in his view, loose syntactic concatenations of free words by
means of sandhi and do not form a single word unit together (1966:62-63). Evidence for
the independence of the parts of a complex are, according to Panfilov, the facts that each
part of the complex preserves its lexical semantics, that each part is inflectable and
focusable (but see section 3.8.1), and that it can bear a syntactic relation to an element in
the sentence outside the complex, e.g. to an adverb, another 'direct object' or modifier,
or any other constituent. Furthermore, Panfilov claims that the elements of a complex
need not be adjacent and that there can be, as he puts it, more than one modifier,
66                    DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
modified, direct object or verb, i.e. in the case of coordination. In the cases of both non-
adjacency and coordination, Panfilov goes on, a form occurring outside a complex has
the same form and function as the corresponding form inside, and he postulates that
identical forms have identical status. From this he concludes that the components of a
complex are not roots or stems, but free words, and that the phenomenon in question
therefore can be neither incorporation nor composition (1960a).
         These arguments will be treated in detail in this chapter as they require minute
exposition in order to be made comprehensible. Suffice it here to say that Panfilov's ar­
gumentation suffers from methodological shortcomings instigated by a strict structuralis­
tic and largely Russocentric approach.
         Compounds do exist in Nivkh, as Panfilov shows (1958), and he is of the opi­
nion that they express single lexical meanings and concepts, that any component prece­
ding another one may not be inflected (but see section 3.8.1), and that none of their parts
may be focused separately. Panfilov does not present further formal differences between
complexes and compounds, and does not discuss consonant alternation at the compound-
internal morpheme boundary. Incorporation, as he understood it in accordance with the
then-valid doctrine of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, is characterized by the compo­
nent parts preserving their lexical semantics and their mutual syntactic relations within
the incorporation unit, but having a different form from their free occurrence, losing
their independent word status and forming one morphological word together, as eviden­
ced, for instance, by vowel harmony, consonant alternation, etc. (1960a: 51). Further­
more, they do not contract relations to parts of the sentence outside the incorporating
unit; in other words, Panfilov postulates that an incorporated noun may not be modified
by an attribute outside of the noun-verb complex (the concept of stranding is not known
to Panfilov).
         For him, any paradigmatic noun form and any paradigmatic verb form are free
word forms because they can occur as such in a sentence (Panfilov does not discriminate
between categories in this respect, see also chapter 6.1) and because all allomorphs of
one morpheme must have the same morphological status. There cannot be both free and
bound forms of one morpheme in one paradigm (1966). In particular, Panfilov considers
the suffixless attributive form of the verb in the Amur dialect to be a participle and a free
form. This claim is based primarily on treating the suffixless Amur form as equivalent to
the attributive form in the Sakhalin varieties, which has a suffix and is therefore consi­
dered to be a participle, because the Sakhalin participle ending is represented by the
nasal which has elided on the Amur (see chapter 2.3). In the Amur variety, however, the
attributive form is formally identical to the verb root (see chapter 2.4.1), and thus no par­
ticiple form exists.
         Panfilov further deduces the free-form status of the attributive form from his
erroneous claim that the finite ḍ-form, which doubtless is a free form, is used as an attri­
bute in the same way his so-called 'participle' (suffixless attributive form) is, a claim
which he believes is proven by the following example.

""dead person"" as a finite verb form in attributive use. Muḍ, however, is not a verb in its
finite ḍ-form, but a nominalized verb form lexicalized as a noun. As such it is identical
in sheer form to the nominalized/indicative/citation form of the verb muḍ ""s.o. dies/
died"". Krejnovič (1966:39) correctly criticizes Panfilov for not observing categorial dis­
tinctions when citing these examples. Further arguments against Panfilov's approach to
the 'participle' are presented in chapter 6.1.
         Panfilov's main criticisms of Krejnovič are first, that Krejnovič does not con­
form to the official opinion regarding incorporation as forwarded by the Soviet Academy
of Sciences (presented above), and second, that his argumentation is contradictory.
         Krejnovič, on the other hand, who in his earlier works writes cautiously of 'syn-
thetism' in Nivkh (1934:194 and 1937:26-35), takes up the term incorporation from
Panfilov (who suggests that Krejnovič actually means incorporation when he talks of
synthetism, 1954:12), and, following Boas, conceives of incorporation as the inclusion
of an object noun or pronoun in the verb (1958:21).
         He considers the Nivkh noun + verb and verb + noun complexes to be cases of
incorporation, forming one single word and encoding syntactic relations (1958, 1966).
He points out that the components of the complexes in Nivkh are not free words, but
bound 'bases' (stems), and that lexical morphemes have several phonologically- and
syntactically-conditioned allomorphs. In the case of nouns, one allomorph is used as a
free form because it is a case form (nominative); the others are bound forms which enter
into the complexes or are inflected. The appearance of allomorphs with different initial
sounds, then, produces the effect of consonant alternation. According to Krejnovič, a
verb root cannot be used as a free form (contrary to Panfilov's claim), but has to be
either minimally marked by the inflectional suffix -4 or to enter into a complex with a
noun. Furthermore, transitive verbs are not complete without a personal prefix or a noun
expressing the direct object (1966:41-42). To summarize, Krejnovič correctly observes
that the verbal allomorphs are bound forms and that the finite marker -ḍ (and indeed any
modal marker for that matter) is not permitted to appear on an attributive verb form. He
adds that, parallel to the disallowed finite markers, case marking is not allowed within
complexes, either (1966:42).
         Krejnovič considers the nasal alternation triggered by a lost weak nasal to be
evidence against Panfilov's interpretation of consonant alternation as external sandhi
(1958:26): whereas Panfilov interprets two morphemes between which consonant alter­
nation occurs as two separate words, Krejnovič points out that since the alternation-trig­
gering nasal elides in the Amur dialect, there are no nasals in the surfacing syntagmatic
68                    DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
chain (where words come together) which could plausibly induce the special alternation.
The alternation must therefore take place at the level of word formation. This reflection
leads Krejnovič to locate the formation of word complexes on the morphological level,
because lexical properties of the constituents play their part in it, although he generally
considers the Nivkh type of 'incorporation' (as he calls it) to be a syntactic device.
          Krejnovič presents us with the bracket-like function of personal prefixes in com­
plexes (1958:26, 1966:40, 42), to which we will return in section 3.8. He furthermore
stresses that the same obligatory consonant alternations are observed at morpheme boun­
daries in noun + verb complexes, verb + noun complexes, on suffixes and in compounds
(1958:30-31). Nevertheless, complexes, according to Krejnovič, are distinguished from
compounds in their formational potential. Krejnovič demonstrates that consonant alter­
nations do not just occur anywhere in identical phonological environments, but are strict­
ly syntactically conditioned (1966:48). He also describes the syntactic conditions under
which there is no complex formation of undergoer and verb (1958:26-28), namely in
object focus, in the coordination of objects or modifiers, and between ditransitive verbs
and their patients (he does not use this terminology, though; cf. chapter 4.4).
          Thus, Krejnovič introduces a considerable amount of relevant and conclusive
evidence for the discussion of wordhood in Nivkh. His arguments and valuable insights
will be taken up throughout this study.
          This short overview was presented in order to demonstrate the nature of the
argument between the two scholars. Their main point of conflict comes from a different
conception of the linguistic entity word and its application to Nivkh. The constituents of
a complex are analyzed in two diametrically opposed ways, either as free words or as
bound stems. Today, forty years after the dispute, the difficulty in reconstructing their
arguments lies partly in the evolution of the discussion of incorporation, which renders
a number of (especially Panfilov's) points unsubstantiated. Whether or not there is incor­
poration in Nivkh from the current viewpoint will be discussed in chapter 5. Suffice it
here to say that neither Panfilov nor Krejnovič consider the paraphrasability of incorpo­
rating constructions to be a necessary criterion for the recognition of incorporation. On
the contrary, Panfilov values the existence of a paraphrase for an object-verb complex as
evidence against incorporation (1954). Other current parameters of incorporation, such
as categorial prerequisites, referentiality and modifier stranding, were equally unknown
in Panfilov's and Krejnovič's time. Furthermore, Panfilov adduces several idiosyncratic
criteria. An evaluation of these points necessitates the presentation of the details of the
structure of word complexes, which will be done in the course of the following chapters.
For this reason, the original dispute has not been reconstructed in greater detail here.
          Krejnovič's position is backed by two other independent studies, Korsakov
(1939) and Bondarko & Zinder (1962). Korsakov compares what he calls incorporation
in Chukcho-Kamchadal languages, Nivkh, and Native American languages (especially
Lakhota, but also Delaware and Nahuatl), and describes different types of incorporative
structures shared by these languages. He presents what we have called the noun + noun,
verb + noun, noun + verb, and verb + verb complexes, as well as complexes formed
 from more than two roots, using several examples from the different languages, and
                  DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS AND WORDHOOD                                    69
attributes the same word status to the Nivkh constructions as, for instance, to the
Chukchi and Lakhota ones (1939). We will examine Bondarko & Zinder's study in de­
tail in section 3.4; they analyze phonetic properties of Nivkh complexes and compounds
and come to the conclusion that they are both units (1962).
          It is interesting to note that after the dispute between Krejnovič and Panfilov, the
issues of wordhood and incorporation are not touched upon in grammatical sketches or
papers on Nivkh, e.g. Hattori (1962a, b); Otaina (1978); Beffa (1982a), etc.; the topic is
mentioned cautiously if at all. Only Savel'eva (1966), in a review of Panfilov's grammar,
criticizes Panfilov by repeating and elaborating upon some of Krejnovič's arguments.
Jakobson (1971, originally published in 1957, i.e. at the time when the dispute had just
begun) proves to be indecisive. On the one hand, he identifies 'syntactic sections' which
are defined as constituting a sentence, being stress units, and only admitting pausing at
their outer boundaries (not within). He addresses the constituents of his 'sections' as
morphemes and points out that there ""are striking differences between intersectional and
intrasectional laws of phonemic combination"" (1971:78). On the other hand, he con­
ceives of a word as a 'monothematic section' (consisting of one stem) or a ""component
of a polythematic section"", only to go on to say that ""the fusion of two words into one
syntactic section takes place always and only when the stem of the subordinated word is
immediately followed by the subordinating word"" (1971:80). He adds that he uses a dash
""to separate stems within a polythematic section"" (1971:80). Thus on the whole, it is not
clear which status he considers complexes and their components to have. Otaina (1978:
 104) mentions the disagreement on the status of the unmarked attributive verb form and
without further discussion takes sides with Panfilov. Gruzdeva (1998:16) devotes one
paragraph of her grammatical sketch to stating that ""Nivkh is an agglutinating synthetic
language"" in which the constructions attribute + head and direct object + verb ""are
sometimes considered as incorporated complexes"" because they form ""particularly close
units"" syntactically and phonologically.
          Nearly forty years after the original dispute, the subject was revisited by Kaneko
(1999), who in the first part of his paper outlines the discussion between Panfilov and
Krejnovič, agreeing largely with Panfilov's arguments. He then reassesses the old mate­
rial from a general formal stance, proposing a bipartite interpretation of the phenomenon,
viz. classifying any concatenation of uninflected object and verb as the incorporation of
word stems (which Krejnovič advocated), and any concatenation of an inflected form
and a verb as the sandhi of words (Panfilov's solution) (1999:40-46). Alternatively, he
proposes the solution to stipulate (in a generative model) that the whole of a maximal
projection (an object + verb or an attribute + noun phrase) is incorporated even if it con­
tains coordinated free forms outside of a complex (1999:45, 47).
          What has not been undertaken to date is a study of Nivkh based on current
models of both wordhood (see e.g. Hall 1999a) and incorporation (e.g. Mithun 1984,
Gerdts 1996, etc.). Wordhood is usually considered to have phonological as well as
morphological and psychological aspects to it, so the bulk of this chapter will be devoted
to the study of the phonological, morphophonological, morphological, and psychological
 aspects of the word in Nivkh. These criteria have not been treated in a thorough or
70                    DEPENDENT-HEAD SYNTHESIS IN NIVKH
detailed fashion for Nivkh to date, and it is intended both to flesh out the old debate and
to examine it from a contemporary perspective.","[76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81]"
"Nivkh converbs, as shown in chapter 1.3.4, are of two types: those which encode their
subject and those which do not. Three forms are of the former type: the general converb
-t/-r (-n/-t/-řon Sakhalin), the anterior converb -tot/-ror (-non/-tot/-řořon Sakhalin), and
the enumerative -ta/-ra (-na/-ta/-ra on Sakhalin). With these verb forms, the /t/-initial
variant cross-references 1s, 1p, 2p, and 3p, and the /r/-initial variant cross-references 2s
and 3s. While the general and anterior converbs occur in embedded clauses (the general
one also with auxiliaries, see chapter 1.3.4), the enumerative occurs in coordinate non-
embedded clauses, in two kinds of constructions. On the one hand, as exemplified in (7),
a chain of the originally non-matrix enumerative forms is closed with a form of the dum­
my matrix predicate haḑ ""it is so"", which also bears any mood inflection.(7)     (cf. Taksami/Polet'eva 1992:50)

suru, with -tari the enumerative converb and sum ""s.o. does sth."" the dummy matrix
form bearing mood and negational inflection.
         On the other hand, the enumerative form in Nivkh can be used without its
dummy and then looks like an independent mood form (see (8), after which Beffa puts
a full stop). The second alternative is found much more frequently.","[215, 216]"

case is marked only once on the last item. Thus, associative, which is known as 'comita-
tive' from other sources, is analyzed as belonging to the category of number here. The
only deviation in behavior from number lies in a positional alternative. Panfilov pre­
sents, without further explanations, two examples of associative marking outside of case
marking as a possible variant to the usual morpheme order [associative_number-case]
(1962:167).",[19]
"10.3     A wider view of polysynthesis
The study of different aspects of Nivkh morphosyntax has shown how structure is orga­
nized by a consistent principle according to which complex word forms are formed from
the concatenation of nouns and verbs in strictly defined relationships, and that the single
compositional mechanisms resemble or partly overlap with noun incorporation and poly­
synthesis. By just describing them as such, however, the concepts of incorporation and
polysynthesis would have to be broadened, but the general principle behind the mecha­
nisms would still not be grasped.
          The comparison of dependent-head synthesis with noun incorporation showed
that tests or criteria of referential activeness and argumenthood of the synthesizing noun,
of polysynthesis, head marking and configurationality do not necessarily apply the way
they are expected to just because the primary object synthesizes with its governing verb
and, as a dependent, is directly marked on its head. This insight suggests that the Nivkh
root concatenation phenomenon should be described in terms of what it actually is, viz.
dependent-head synthesis, and recognized as an organization principle in its own right.
          The question then arises of whether this organizational principle, general as it is,
may be found underlying the structure of other languages as well. This, however, cannot
be determined based only on extant materials.
          A further question concerns the status of dependent-head synthesis with respect
to polysynthesis. The reconciliation of both structural types is subject to the discrepancy
between the homogeneity of the principle of dependent-head synthesis and the heteroge­
neity of the ingredients and cross-linguistic moldings of polysynthesis. It first has to be
decided how broadly or narrowly polysynthesis is to be interpreted.
          The structural parallelisms of Nivkh with Chukchi, Ket, So:ra, Wichita, Nez
Perce, Lakhota, Comanche, Kiowa, and Ainu, besides the differences in the internal
organization of the verb forms and in the role non-root bound morphemes with fairly
concrete, 'lexical' meanings play, lie in the complex verb forms arising from the synthe-
sization of noun and verb roots. Especially between Chukchi and Nivkh, differences
seem to be of degree rather than kind. The parallelism among the languages mentioned
would be veiled by a sharp delimitation of polysynthesis. On the other hand, such a deli­
mitation from non-polysynthetic agglutinating languages by way of minimality con­
straints seems desirable.
          For complex noun forms, formed by integrating modifiers such as lexical roots
or non-root bound morphemes in addition to the expected categories of number, case,
                               TYPOLOGICAL OUTLOOK                                      289
definiteness or gender, the notion of polysynthesis would have to be enlarged, as sug­
gested in chapter 9. Polysynthesis then would actually assume the status of a separate
morphological type. Complex noun forms, however, exist in otherwise non-polysynthe-
tic languages as well, such as Sanskrit and German, which suggests that they follow a
principle of their own, independent of the verb form. A separate term for this phenome­
non would then be needed.
          All the languages mentioned above manifest both complex (polysynthetic) verb
forms and noun forms all of which arise from root concatenation (see chapters 8 and 9;
Spencer 1995, Werner 1997, Rood 1976, Boas/Deloria 1979, Charney 1993, Watkins
1984, Tamura 2000; Nez Perce, however, has non-root bound morphemes only, see Aoki
1970). This means that a uniform formation principle is valid for both verb and noun
forms in these languages (as is the case with Nivkh), which is not taken into account in
the traditional approach to polysynthesis.
          Furthermore, a uniform formation principle is found in Greenlandic, Kwakwala,
Tsimshian, and Tariana, in which both noun and verb complexes arise from the affixing
of non-root bound morphemes (see chapter 9; Fortescue 1984; Boas 1911c, 1911b;
Aikhenvald 1999).
          Thus, both the compositional and the affixal strategies are not only valid for
both verb and noun forms, but may also apply to both at the same time and thus describe
an overall structural principle of a language.
          Such languages stand in contrast to (verbal) polysynthetic languages such as
Karok (Bright 1957:56-57), in which noun forms are barely inflected or derived at all.
Languages such as the latter seem to be a minority, however, since in most polysynthetic
languages examined here nouns (if they can be delimited as a separate lexical category
at all) are not so simple (see chapter 9; in contrast to what Mithun predicts 1988:443). In
fact, no language in the sample lacks number, case, possessive marking or derivational
affixes (such as diminutive or 'tense') altogether, even if these categories are less salient
than in e.g. some European languages (with the exception of English) in disposing of
few or no central cases, in marking collective instead of number or number on animate
nouns only, etc. Nevertheless, the noun form in a polysynthetic language is generally
more simply structured than the verb form if templates are compared, but this applies to
non-poly synthetic languages as well.
          It seems to make sense to acknowledge the overall structural principle as a type
in its own right, perhaps even as a morphological type, as it is superordinate to polysyn­
thesis (as it is presently understood). We might call this overall principle polysynthesis,
but in that case the delimitation to verb-only polysynthesis must be reinterpreted.
          Leaving these points for further reflection, we close with the final observation
that it is on such a superordinate principle, independent of polysynthesis and operating
on both noun and verb forms, that Nivkh dependent-head synthesis is cast as well.

1998:30).
         The tense-unmarked verb form in Nivkh is in fact non-future. Future events are
signalled in the Amur dialect by future -nә- or by intentional -inә-, and by -i- in Sakhalin
(Krejnovič 1979:315, Austerlitz 1958:480, Watanabe 1983:65, Hattori 1988:1412). In
the Amur dialect, an element -i- appears in verb forms before a modal or focal element,
or before a derivational suffix, but has no temporal function.
         The modal domain is encoded on a Nivkh verb form with suffixes expressing
deontic and epistemic modalities and moods. Deontic modalities are encoded by non-
final suffixes (table 1.7; see also chapter 6.4; Krejnovič 1934:217-218, 1979:317;
Panfilov 1965:104-106, 155-163; Otaina 1978:93).
         Further modalities are encoded in periphrastic constructions. In the Amur dia­
lect, additional deontic modalities are expressed with a free modal verb taking the propo­
sition as its complement (in the ḑ-form, see chapter 4.3).(37)     complement taking modal verbs
        jajmḑ ""s.o. knows how to V""
        jәyzuḑ ""s.o. does not know how to V""

        jәyiḑ    ""s.o. does not want to V""
        jaliḑ    ""s.o. cannot master/cope with V-ing""

  In the East Sakhalin dialect, the modality morpheme -t'әym-/-řәym- ""show signs of' seems to be
a contracted form after the model of the habitual and progressive as well because of its person
marking (with the /ţ/-allomorph for Is and plural persons); the source of *(h)әym-, however, is
not transparent.

root, and a considerable range of inflectional affixes, including possessive marking, po-
lysynthetic languages like Greenlandic and Tariana come up with complex noun forms
into which components that are separate constituents of noun phrases in more analytic
languages are integrated.
         In contrast to Greenlandic, in which the derivational, i.e. non-obligatory catego­
ries prevail, nouns in the polysynthetic Arawak language Tariana, spoken in Northwest
Amazonia, are described by Aikhenvald as being inflectionally-complex. She gives 15
position classes, some of which are recursive, i.e. may be marked more than once.

cult to assess (Sascha Aikhenvald, pers. comm.). Slots 10 to 15 are filled by case, scalar
operators and focus markers, a feature reminiscent of Nivkh. Positions 5 to 15 are only
filled on the head noun of a noun phrase, i.e. once per phrase. In addition, 'tense' and de­
gree markers are found on the noun. Other modifiers are not attached to their head
nouns, however, but are separate constituents bearing an agreement marker which is also
encountered on the head noun (Aikhenvald 1999).","[263, 264]"

German coordinate gapping in ad hoc formations.",[129]
"4.2.1 Non-transitive verbs
Non-transitive verbs are characterized by the absence of an undergoer slot. Avalent
verbs, such as weather expressions, e.g. lajuɖ} ""it is stormy"", do not license a participant.
There are labile verbs which allow two constructional alternatives, an avalent and an
intransitive use (i.e. with a subject), e.g.tivaɖ""it is cold"", qavɖ ""it is hot"",vukvukuaɖ""it
darkens"", Ŋɖ ""it is dark"",k'unuaɖ""it is bright, clear"",letBd""it is slippery"", rjalsqo ""it is

In organization type (ii), the components of a verb form are not fixed in their position,
but rather in their scope, which allows them to be ordered according to the intended mea­
ning. This can be seen in Greenlandic (in which only the first (root) and the last (inflec­
tion) slot are determined, cf. Fortescue 1980:260) especially with the causative, passive
and with negation, as in the example below in which different orderings of suffixes yield
different meanings (in type (i), on the other hand, there are no ordering alternatives at
all).","[297, 298]"

conditions and how frequently it is employed. The contexts in which a plain verb root
occurs as a phonological word are thus clearly restricted and marked; there is no general
free use of a verb root and no evidence for postulating a participle in the Amur variety.
This observation is in line with Krejnovic (1966) and Bondarko & Zinder (1962).
         We turn now to the details of verb root serialization.",[199]

tive verb, it becomes the subject, and a 3s undergoer prefix takes its place on the verb, as

"3.5      Nivkh morphophonemic alternations as sandhi
Disregarding the evidence for the wordhood of Nivkh complexes for the moment and
approaching them from the reverse angle, we must examine what else they could con­
ceivably be.
         Panfilov considers morphophonemic alternation in Nivkh to be a case of sandhi
between independent words (1966:62). In the current linguistic apprehension, sandhi is
a rather loosely defined term, comprising a wide range of different phenomena, as
Andersen (1986:1-2) and Ternes (1986:11) admit, even including allomorphic alterna­
tion and cliticization. To demonstrate this heterogeneity, a range of phenomena descri­
bed as sandhi in the literature are presented in (39) to (45), to be referenced throughout
this section.
