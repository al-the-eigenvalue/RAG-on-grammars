"                        10.6        SENTENCE    CONNECTIVES   Sentence connectives include such words as hinya’tihé ‘‘now,
then, so, after that’’; hz’nahkuhé ‘“‘now, then, so, after that’ (used
interchangeably with hinya’tihé); hi’nahkuskan ‘‘nevertheless,
however, in spite of this, that’’; hz’nahk?ohéat ‘therefore, for this,
that reason’; ka’Sile’he, ka’Slehe ‘“‘forsooth; it turned out that
way”; 2a’/hak?thé “otnerwise, or, or else, or perhaps.”          These
words are used to establish a loose conjunctive or contrastive re-
lation between a sentence and the sentence that precedes it.
Examples:
        hinya'tthé, ?u'k?uhke'nt. (48:b) Now he sat down.
        hinya'tihé, te’Cak ?uya’nako'nt. (4B:ak) Then Woodpecker spoke
             to him.
        hi'nahkuhé, ha’ttkan, ?uya'nakate'ni. (13:k) Then she spoke to
               him again.
           hi’nahkuskdn, ha'tikan, haka’likate'nt. (4B:f) But in spite of
                this she stood up again.
           hi’nahkuskén, ta’ sithkalte'ntku, hi’hé ?una'ni. (224:e) However,
                the Avoyelles were living there.
           hi'nahk?ohéat, ma’runistuk?oh3S. (12:b) Therefore I cannot re-
                turn.
           ka’ Slehén, yu'katthé, hopi’?unthke'ni.           (19:1) It turned out that
               way; when (the time) came, they got out.
           ?a'hak?ihe, ka'pasi ha'raktin, ni’kate'ni.     ?a’hak?thé, sa'?an,
                wo'huktin, ni’kate’ni.    (12:b) “Or perhaps a rooster was
                crowing?”’ she said. ‘“‘Or else a dog was barking?” she said.
  In addition to its use as a sentence connective                  ?a’hak?thé is also
occasionally used as a word connective, e.g.,
           wi'ran ta'ythkin, ?a’hak?thé, tt’ sthkin, yu’ katihé (19:1) in seven
                or eight minutes < when it gets to be seven or eight
                minutes (?a’hak?ihé used as a connective between ta’yihku
                seven and t2’sihku eight)
134                                HAAS      TUNICAIn a similar manner the adverb ha’t?ena ‘“‘again, once more’’ is
sometimes used as a word connective with the meaning ‘‘and,”’
e.g.,
           to/nisise’man, ha’t?end, to'ninu'hisi’niman,           hi’ putahé (41a%a)
                  when the men and the women dance (ha’t?ena used as a
                  connective between to’nisise’ma the men and to’ninu’ héisi'-
                  nima the women)
                   10.7     EXCLAMATIVES        AND      IMITATIVES   Exclamatives           and   imitatives     are    always    used    as    minimal
clauses, i1.e., they constitute a clause by themselves.                      The   most
important exclamatives are hin “‘yes,” ?ahé “no,” and dé “now;
ready.’ Of these ?ahé is used not only as the equivalent of Eng-
lish ‘no,’ but also as the equivalent of such an expression as
‘nothing much” in answer to a question like ‘‘what are you do-
ing?” or as the equivalent of ‘‘nowhere (in particular)” in answer
to a question like ‘‘where are you going?’ Examples of exclama-
tives:
            ?uhk?a'katohk ?ula'kdn, niko’ni.          (4a:bn) hinya’tihé, hén, ?uni’-
                  kate’ni.  (4a:bo) ‘Does he have           any little children?”     he
                  said. ‘‘Yes,” she told him.

"                         7.4    Typrs    orf CLAUSES
   7.41 Clauses are of two principal types, main and subordinate.
In addition it is necessary to distinguish four types of subordinate
clauses: dependent, complementary, relative, and adverbial. Note
also that dependent clauses may be subordinate only to the main
clause whereas complementary, relative, and adverbial clauses
may be subordinate to the main clause or to a dependent clause.
   7.42   Main clauses are constructed like simple sentences (7.31)
and differ from them only in that they are a part of a compound or
complex sentence, e.g.,
          (pwimc-1)     ?uya'nale'pihk?a'taman,       (pw:Mc-2)     ?uso'lekate’nt.
               (9:1) She was speaking to him and creeping up on him, it
               is said.
          (pw: Dc) tiya’nawthé, (pw: mc) haka'l?eke'ni. (48:bm) When he
               spoke to her, she stopped, it is said.
_ 743     Dependent clauses are constructed like main clauses but
in addition their predicative word contains a subordinating post-
fix. For example, in the sentence quoted immediately above tiya’-
’ The following abbreviations are used for the various types of clauses: Mc, main
  clause; pc, dependent clause; cc, complementary clause; Rc, relative clause;
  AC, adverbial clause. In addition a numeral following a hyphen indicates that
  it is the first, second, third, etc., main clause, dependent clause, etc.

-hé, subordinating postfix (9.32, no. 4). Other types of subordinat..
-ing postfixes are discussed and illustrated in 9.32.
    7.44 Complementary clauses may be (1) clauses of direct or
indirect discourse or (2) “‘what’’ or ‘‘where’’ clauses.
   Clauses of direct discourse may be constructed like simple sen-
tences or like complex sentences but in addition they are subordj-
nated to a main or dependent clause by hypotaxis. The predicg-
tive word    of the clause which they complement                    is usually built
upon the active verb stem nz’ ‘‘to say; to say to, tell,” though in
rare instances it is built upon the stem pa’ka. .c. “to answer, re-
ply; to reply to” or upon the stem wi’ra. .c. ‘‘to ask; to question,
ask a question of,’ e.g.,
           (Pw: cc) ?a’nistuk?ohd5, (Pw: Mc) ?u’niko’nt. (144:1) “I can’t go,”
               he told him, it is said.
           (is:mc)   ta’nardku,    (Ppw:cc)      ?ri’hé?ikin,       (pwimc)   ntko'ng.
                (14B:e) ‘“‘Tie me!” said the snake, it is said.","[90, 91]"

72                                 HAAS      TUNICAOn the other hand, if the events expressed are consecutive, the
stems occur in the logical order of the sequence of the events, e.g, .
             haka'liya'n?ake'ni.    (5B:d)    She stood up and spoke;    based on
                  ka'li to stand + ya’na to speak
             na'raya' kapo'wthé (5B:a) when he got up and came and looked:
                  based on na’ra to get up + ya’ka to come + po’ to look’
There are, moreover, a few stems which, by virtue of the fact that
they express       an event which         must    logically succeed     the other
events in the linkage, always take final position.            The most widely
used of these are ho’tu ‘‘to finish, complete, end” and ha’pa “to
stop, quit, cease,” e.g.,
             yu’ kiho'tusi'tthé (13:v) when they had finished cooking; based
                   on yu’ki to cook + ho’tu
             wa'haha'pawthé (6a:b) when he quit weeping; based on wa’ha
                  to weep + ha'paIn connection with the last example note that it must have been
from such occurrences as these that the atonic thematic                     suffix
-hapa- (see 5.219) was developed.
     5.232    In case an intransitive stem is linked with a transitive
stem the pronominal prefix may be placed in front of either stem,
though it will ordinarily be placed in front of the transitive stem,
e.g.,
             ya'k?iwa'&uhki. (4a:v) he came and fought me; based on
                  ya'ka to come + wa’ to fight, to which the 1s pref.
                  ?thk- is attached
             ?uwe’ sata’p?ehkint. (30) I jumped and caught him; based on
                  we'sa to Jump + ta’p7 to catch, the 3ms pref. ?uhk- being
                  placed before the intr. stem we’sa
   In case two transitive stems having the same logical object are
linked the pronominal prefix is used only with the first of them,
e.g.,
             Puxu'
                 ira’ p%ik?thé (4B:m) if you shoot him and kill him; based
               on Su’ to shoot + ra’pa to kill, the 3s pref. ?uhk- serving
               as the obj. of both
             tira’ pape'k?uhke'ni. (9:1) He hit her and killed her; based on
                   ra'pa + pe’ka to hit, the 3rs pref. téhk- serving as the
                  obj. of both   5.233 There are a few cases in which the linkage of active verb
stems results in a specialization of meaning and some of these have
become stereotyped or petrified in combination. The following
cases are the most important:
     (1) éu’ “to take” + ya’ka “to come”               (or rarely, ya’ka + éu’)
has the specialized meaning ‘“‘to bring to,” as in na’rdn,                 ?ihéu'-
yak?ik thé (148:a) “if you bring me a snake.”
              HANDBOOK       OF   AMERICAN     INDIAN    LANGUAGES              73      (2) hu’&, of unknown meaning,            + la’mz, perhaps ‘“‘to soften”’
    (cf. 5.5) has the meaning “to tan (hide),”’ as in hu’éila’mthk?ura’ni
    (21:a) “he was tanning (hides).”
        (3) ri’héu + to’wi or to'wi..c.' has the specialized meaning
“to tie,” as in ka’tan, ?uri’héuto’wentahé (20:e) ‘where they tied
him.”      But the informant would also use either stem alone with
the same meaning, as in wir2’hé?5né (14a:d) “if I tie you” and
ka’tan, ?uhto’w2entahé (20:h), the exact equivalent of the example
of the combined form just given.
   (4) A bound stem le’pz. .c. is used only in combinations wherein
it is preceded by (or rarely, followed by) the stems ya’na ‘‘to
speak, speak to” or wi’ra. .c. “‘to question, ask a question of.’’ It
has not been possible to detect any clearcut difference in meaning
between ya’na or wt’ra. .c. used alone and either of them used in
combination with le’pi..c. Examples are ?uya’nale’pthk?ata’ni
(13:q) ‘she was speaking to him’’; wi’rale’pihk?ata’ni (non-text)
“she was asking a question.’”” Compare these with the following
words of respectively identical meanings: ?uya’nakate’nt (13:k)
and wi’rahk?ata’ni (13: aa).
   (5) 2a’ru, a bound stem of unknown meaning, + po’ “‘to look”
has the meaning ‘“‘to dream,” as in ?a’rupo’hk?a’rani (30) “TI lay
dreaming.”’
   (6) se’ha, of unknown meaning, + po’ has the meaning ‘‘to ex-
amine, make an examination,” as in se’hapo’hk?urana’ni (25:c¢)
“they were examining.’’ The combination also occurs in the agen-
tive noun stem (5.44) ta’sehapo’ “‘mirror’’ (< ‘‘examiner’’).
   (7) pa’ri + ne’hka has the meaning “‘to copulate, have sexual
intercourse” (no text examples). Though the informant would
also use either stem alone with the same meaning, the combination
was preferred.
   5.234 This process of linking active verb stems is one of the
most interesting features of Tunica. The few examples given in
the preceding paragraphs are scarcely sufficient to make clear the
frequency with which the process is employed; for an understand-
Ing of this, the reader is referred to ‘‘Tunica Texts.’ By means of
these linkings we have in Tunica the possibility of a sort of mor-
Phological telescoping whereby it becomes unnecessary to repeat
the subjective element with each stem and, in the case of transi-
tive verbs having the same object, we have a further telescoping
whereby it becomes unnecessary to repeat the objective element
with each stem. Such forms have a stylistic conciseness and vivid-
hess that is unfortunately often lost in the English translations.
Another feature deserving mention in this connection is that vir-
    This stem is sometimes used as a causative, sometimes as a non-causative, with
1      °      .       °                    °         .                    .     .
    no difference in meaning.
74                                HAAS   TUNICAtually synonymous stems are sometimes linked in order to make
more vivid the picture that is being portrayed, e.g., t’Slindhé,
ta’yoronéa'hak ?uhk?o'nise’man, na'mu ri'kin sthko'héusa’kukate'ni
(4B:k) ‘The Stone Witch was devouring and eating too many of
the Tunica chief’s people” wherein sihko’héusa’kukate'ni is based
on ko’héu “to devour” + sa’ku “‘to eat.”","[70, 71, 72, 73]"
"       4.56     THE     OBJECTIVE     INFLECTION      OF     ACTIVE   VERBS   4.561   Objective inflection, in which both non-causative and
causative verbs are treated alike, is accomplished by means of the
alienable pronominal prefixes or the reciprocal prefix. Examples
of the use of the alienable pronominal prefixes @. 21) as objects of
transitive verbs are as follows:
         ?ithpe’k?ontd.   (14a:1) they hit me < #hk-, 1s pref., + pe’k-
               2onta they hit

              pref., + sa’kuti she ate + -aha, neg. postf., + -a’niTunica recognizes no formal difference between direct and indi-
Tect objects of transitive verbs.           In the case of a transitive verb
which seems (from the English viewpoint) to require both a direct
and an indirect object, we find that pronominal reference is made
only to the latter, e.g.,
         tryu'w?ak?thé (11a: d) if you give (this) to her < thk-,               3Fs

sub-classes: intransitive, transitive, impersonal, and transimper-
sonal. While none of these sub-classes makes use of any special
inflectional elements, each of them (except the transitive) is re-
stricted in a different way as to which of the total number of in-
flectional elements it may use. Thus intransitives are inflected
only for pronominal subject while transitives normally undergo.
additional inflection for pronominal object.      Impersonals differ
from intransitives in that they may be inflected only for a third
person feminine pronominal subject. Transimpersonals are like
impersonals in inflection for subject but undergo further inflection
for pronominal object.              Hence impersonals are to intransitives as
transimpersonals are to transitives.
                                4.62     INTRANSITIVES
     Intransitives may be inflected only for pronominal subject and
the rules for the subjective inflection of active verbs already given
(4.52 to 4.54) take care of all that need be said concerning the in-
flection of this sub-class. A special sub-group of intransitives is
discussed in the next section.
          4.63     LIMITED     INTRANSITIVES            OR    PERSONIFICATIVES   There are two types of limited intransitives which may be re-
ferred to as masculine and feminine personificatives, respectively.
The former may be inflected only for a 3Ms pronominal subject,
the latter only for a 3Fs pronominal subject. With respect to their
limited subjective inflection, personificatives resemble imper-
sonals.     There is, however, an important distinction between the
two types of verbs: Whereas the subjective element of personifica-
tives refers to a realistic entity (as shown below) which may be
substantivally expressed within the sentence, the subjective ele-
ment of impersonals refers to a non-realistic or nameless entity
1 There seem to be no text examples in which this prefix occurs before a stem be-
  ginning in ?.

  Masculine personificatives comprise verbs referring to certain
weather manifestations thought to be controlled by the Thunder
Being (personified as a man; see texts 4a and 48). The following
stems come in this category: ya’lu..c. ‘‘to hail”; mi’ra. .c. “to
lighten”; mo’éa..c.           “to drizzle”; mo’htt..c.         or mo’htu..c.       “to
snow’;   sa’pi     “‘(rain)    to beat    down’”’; sa’é      “to rain”;     la’ka “to
frost’; ra’hi..c. “to thunder”; Sa’hu “‘(rain) to patter.” Note
that a form like ra’hin?u’hkz “at has thundered” (< ra‘hi..c. +
_n + ?u’hki, 3Ms) carries the implication that ‘he (the Thunder
Being) has thundered.”
   Feminine personificatives comprise (1) verbs referring to the
changes of the moon (personified as a ‘‘granny’’) and (2) verbs
referring to the diurnal periods controlled by the sun (personified
as a young woman; see texts 3a, 3B, and 3c). The verbs referring
to the changes of the moon are we’ka “‘to wane’ and he’mu “‘to
wax’’ (no text examples).             The verbs referring to the diurnal pe-
riods are: se’hz ‘(the sun) to rise,’ hence, ‘‘to get to be day, morn-
ing’’; ta’ha. .c. ‘(the sun) to pass the meridian,” hence, “‘to get to
be afternoon’’; la’ ‘(the sun) to set,” hence, ‘‘to get to be night,”
€.g.,
         se'hitihé (15:f) when day came < when she (the sun) had risen

               meridian
         la’tthé (4a: ar) when night came < when she had set
Note particularly that se’hitihé is often used in place of such Eng-
lish adverbial expressions as ‘‘in the morning” (9:f), ‘‘tomorrow”
(1la:a), “the next day” (9:d) while la’tihé is similarly often used
In place of “at night”? (8B:c) and “after dark’ (19:b).","[54, 55, 56]"

two (of them) were running toward the bank.           The waves were coming
(toward them). When they came to the bank, the waves reached them
and caught them.    Then the orphan boy climbed up onto the bank
alone. The girl had gone down (into the water) and had disappeared.
The orphan boy went home.
  ce. He lived with his maternal uncle at (the latter’s) home.             Every
morning he went (there) and tried to find his sister.        He could not find
her. He went back home. One morning he forgot (to go). He was just
sitting at home. One day she came back. She brought two beans. She
spoke to him.   She asked him a question.          ‘Have    you   (pl.) anything
good to eat?” she said.
   d. “No. There is nothing,” he said.
   e. “If you place the kettle on the fire, it will be a good thing,” she
told him. So he placed the kettle on the fire. Then she broke one of the
beans and put it in the kettle. She spoke to him. ‘If the kettle boils
thoroughly and (the bean) gets done, you will eat well (of it),”’ she
told him.
   f. He, on his part, wanted to play (but) she did not wish to play.
She spoke to him. “Four days after I plant the bean I eat it,’’ she said.
He did not hear her.
  g. Then she spoke to him once more.            ‘Four months after I plant
the bean I eat it,” she said.    “If I give you (this) bean and if you plant
it, you will (be able to) eat it in four months,” she told him.
    h. When she had finished speaking, she went back and disappeared
into the ocean once more.","[141, 142]"

"In rare cases (perhaps incorrectly) -ki is followed by the impera-
tive -n, e.g., 2iri’hé?ikin (14B:e) ‘Tie me!’ Note also that in the
first telling of Text no. 4 the form ki’?umu’r?eki (4a:br) ‘Shove
him in!’ is employed              whereas in the second telling the form kz’-
?umu’r2én (4B: bt), having the same meaning, is used in the same
situation. If any conclusion can be drawn from these two exam-
ples it is that the affective difference between -kz and -n is not very
great.
   (10) -héan, imperative postf., used only with the semelfactive
forms of auxiliary or active verbs. Since there is some reason to
think that -héan is used with a somewhat more persuasive force
           HANDBOOK           OF    AMERICAN         INDIAN     LANGUAGES                      119than the other imperative postfixes, it is rendered as ‘must                                . . .,”
e.g.,
          ya'k@thcdn.   (14a:h) You must come.   (< ya’k?2 you M come
               + -héan)
          27’ma ro'hpant ?u'k?théén. (148:0) You must sit near me.
          ta’ri ki’ én, 2a'k?thédn. (148:0) You must come into the house.
                (Cf. the second example below under -tan)
   (11) -tan, imperative postf., used with the semelfactive forms
of an auxiliary or active verb in only two cases, viz.,
          hi'héin, wt’natdn.          (4atae)    Stay here!         (wi’natan < wi'na you
                M stay + -tan)
          ta’ri ki’ Gin, 2a/k?itdn.       (144:1) Come into the house!
In all other cases -tan is used in connection with the negative post-
fix -?aha (no. 17 below) with the force of a prohibitive. Prohibi-
tive forms are not inflected; in other words, -?aha + -tan (in this
order) are added directly to active verb infinitives, e.g.,
          2uhpe'k?ahatan.           (13:1) Don’t beat him!            (< ?uhpe’ka to beat
               him + -?aha + -tan)
          ?u'run®chetdn.  (2:a) Do not shout!                   (< ?u’runi, caus. infin.,
               to shout + -?aha + -tan)
   (12) -k?ahéa, future postf., used only with the semelfactive
10orms of auxiliary and active verbs or with semelfactive inchoa-
tive forms of static verbs, e.g.,
          2a'nik?ahéd.        (14Bin)     I'll go.      (< ?a’ni I go, smlf. aux. vb.,
                + -k?ahéa)

                tutik?ahca < wispi'tutti          you     forget,     smlf.    inch.    st.    vb.,
                + -k?ahéa)
   (13)   -k?7 or, rarely, -?¢ “‘if,’”’ conditional postf., used with the
semelfactive forms of auxiliary and active verbs and with non-
inchoative forms of static verbs.                Conditionals of static verbs may
be formed only by means of this element. Auxiliary and active
verbs, however, have conditional paradigms which may be em-
ployed in place of the conditional postfix (4.44 and 4.523). The
conditional postfix (or a conditional paradigmatic form) is always
followed by the subordinating postfix -hé (no. 4, above). Examples
of -k?2 are:
          mo’yuto'hkiuin,      wi'yak?thé        (20:e)    if   you     proceed        stealthily
                (wi'yak?thé < wi'ya you              M go, proceed,           smlf.    aux.     vb.,
                + =k? + -hé)
          ta’yiwo he'rawi ‘nak thé (9:d) if you guard the fire (he’rawi’-
               nak?thé < he'rawi'na you Mp guard, watch, smlf. act. vb.,
                + -k?¢ + -hé)
           he'main,   se'mi        hiwa'nak?thé      (4B:ca)     if you       want     to     come
                (hiwa'nak*thé < hiwa’na you F want                    + -k?2     + -hé)
120                                    HAAS    TUNICAExamples of -?2 are rare:
         9/ri& se’mt wiwa'n?thé (12:f) if you want to come to my home
               (wiwa'n?ihé < wiwa'na you M want + -?7 + -hé); contrast
               with example immediately above
         ka'kuin, hu’mara ya'weh?ihé (1) should anyone not have fasted
               < if anyone did not fast (ya’weh?ihé < ya’wi he did, made
               + -aha, neg. postf., + -?2 + -hé)
   (14) -pan “even if, even though, though,” concessive postf.
used two or three times with a semelfactive form of an auxiliary
verb, once with a habitual form of an active verb, e.g.,
         wt'yapdn (14a:p) even if you                go away     (< wi’ya you M           go,
              smlf. aux. vb., + -pan)
         ?¢’mayo, ni'kupan (4B:ar) even if he says “It is I” (ni’kupan
               < nt'ku he says, hab. act. vb., -+ -pan)
   (15) -k, future subjunctive, used with the semelfactive forms
of auxiliary and active verbs. It is used only in clauses of indirect
discourse and is attached to the predicative word of such clauses
whenever the future tense is intended, e.g.,
         ho'nuwtk, ?uni’sina’ni.              (4a:az) They told him to come down
               < that he should           come     down.    (ho’nuwik < ho’nuwit he
               came down + -k)
         hthé ?a'kawitk,       ?u'niko’ni.      (19:h)   He told him to go in there
               < that he should go in there.
         2a’ Su sa’hkiin, we'ran?u'wdk, niko'nt.             (20:2) One day he said
               he was going hunting.
If the verb of the clause of indirect discourse is negativized the
element -k precedes the negative postfix -?aha (no. 18 below) and
such cases are not to be confused with the negative postfix -k?aha
(no. 17 below), e.g.,
         hopt'wik?ahdn, ?uni’wihkt. (4a:v) you                 told him not to come
              out < that he should not come                     out    (hopt'wik?aha
               < hopt'wi he got out + -k + -?aha)                        9.34       NEGATIVE        POSTFIXES
   (16) -aha “not,’’ negative postf., used only with the semelfac-
tive forms of auxiliary and active verbs and with the semelfactive
inchoative forms of static verbs. When used with active verbs
(4.55) or inchoative static verbs (4.74) it forms what may be called
their negative semelfactive paradigm. Examples:
         2a! éehe'ni, ti/ri¥     (4a:c) she was not at home < was not sitting
              at her home              (?a’éehe'ni < 2a’ she was sitting, smlf.
              aux. vb., + -aha + -a’ni, quot. postf.)                                 ;
        ya'kawcehe'nt          (9:b)    he did not come        back   (< ya’kawi he
              came back, smlf. act. vb., + -aha + -a’nt)                          .
         ?uya' Sitehé. (non-text) He did not get angry.               (< ?uya’ site he
              got angry, smlf. inch. st. vb., + -aha)
          HANDBOOK          OF   AMERICAN   INDIAN    LANGUAGES           121   (17) -k?aha “‘not,”’ negative postf. In contrast to -aha (no. 16),
-k?aha is used to build what may be called the negative habitual
paradigm of active verbs (4.55) or of inchoative static verbs (4.74),
even though, on the formal level, it may be attached only to their
semelfactive forms. Examples:
         ta’ri ki’ Gin, sa’ Giwik?aha'nt. (36a:c) It would not rain in the
               house. (sa’éiwik?aha’ni < sa’ciwi it rained, smlf. act. vb.,
             + -k?aha + -a’'ni)
        we'r?utak?aha'ni. (20:2) He would not hunt.           (< we’r?uta he
             hunted, smlf. act. vb., + -k?aha + -a’nz)
         ?uya’ sitik?ahd.    (non-text) He does not get angry.   (< ?uya’ str
              he got angry, smlf. inch. st. vb., + -k?aha)   (18) -?aha “‘not,’? negative postf. In -?aha we have a third
negative postfix which is used in still other ways, viz., with non-
irchoative forms of static verbs (4.74) and with independent
personal pronouns, nouns, and adjectives when these are used as
predicative words. Moreover, when a predicative noun is modified
by an adjective or when a non-inchoative static verb or a predica-
tive adjective is modified by a comparative, the element -?aha is
attached to the adjective or to the comparative, as the case may
require. F-amples:
        ?use'paha’ni       (4B:w) he was not pleased        (< ?us?e’pa he
              was pleased, non-inch. st. vb., + -?aha + -a’nt)
        ?u'wrehé (19:e) it isnot he (< ?u’wi, 3ms pron., + -?aha)
        ka’pas?ché. (12:b) It is not a chicken. (< ka’pas chicken,
              noun, + -?aha)                            ,
        ta’wismi'liku, ti’k?aha'ni. (28) Red River was not big. (ti’k-
              2aha'nt < te’ka big, adj., + -?aha + -a’nt)
         ?¢’yut2ema’ kan, la'pu pa’n?oho'nt. (85D: c) Lard is not very good.
              (pa'n?oho'nt < pa’nu very, comp., + -?aha + -a’ni, modi-
              fying la’pu good, adj.)
In addition, -?aha may be added to an active verb infinitive to
form a prohibitive with or without the further addition of the
imperative postfix -tan (no. 11, above), e.g.,
        ta’la ki’Cuin, 2a'm?ché. (4a:y) Don’t go into the canebrake!
              (?a’m?che < ?a'mi to go + -?aha)
        ?ira'p?ahatan.       (10:e) Do not kill me!    (< ?ira’pa to kill me
              + -?aha + -tan)
   (19) -p?aha “no, not any” (< -pa, no. 22, + -?aha, no. 18),
used with nouns and interrogative-indefinite pronouns when these
occur as predicative words, e.g.,
        20'ntp?aha'ni. (44:an) There were no people. (< ?0’nt person
             + -p?aha + -a’nt)

                 like a person. (?0'ninah(ku) < ?0’ni a person + -nahku)
           HANDBOOK           OF    AMERICAN     INDIAN      LANGUAGES                123  (24) -tahki “only, nothing but . . .,”’ used with substantives.
When used with pronouns it may often be rendered ‘‘. . . alone;
by .. .-self.””.     Examples:
          ?u'witahk     ?uya’?ake'nt.       (7B:c)     He   came     to be   by   himself.
               (?u/witahkt < ?u’wi, 3Ms pron., + -tahkt)
          2u' Sahpus, po'wihé, ta’hkitahke'nit    (19:f) when he looked in
                his face, it was nothing but bones    (ta’hkitahke’ni < ta’hki
                bones + -tahki + -a’nt)
   (25) -Stahahki “only            . . .,”’ used with numerals, e.g.,
          sa'hkustahahk        ?una’s?uwa'ni.        (9:q) He went on leading only
               one.     (sa’hkustahahki < sa’hku one + -stahahkt)
   (26) -te’pan or, in a few cases -hte’pan “every                    . . .,”’ used with
nouns denoting a given length of time, e.g.,
          yu'pahta pa'nu ya'kate'ni, ti'hikate'pdn                 (1) it gets very cold
               every year.         (ti’hikate’pan < ti'hika year + -te’pan)
          2a’ Suhte’pan       (25:b) every day        (< ?a'Suhki day + -te’pan or
               -hte’pan)
          la’wute'pan (31:4) every night (< la’wu night + -te’pan)
          la’wuhte'pan (10:a) every night (< la’wu + -hte’pan)
          se’hthte'pan (7a:        a) every morning (< se’hi morning + -hte’pan)
The form la’wuhte’pan occurs still more frequently in a shortened
form lu hlepan (e.g., 32:b) ‘every night.”
   (27) -8a“‘ . . .-ish; almost, not quite, somewhat.” It does not
occur in the texts, but in non-text examples it is used with adjec-
tives and with non-inchoative static verb forms, e.g.,
          mt'liga reddish; almost, not quite red (< mi'lired + -Sa)
          2usru’kasa he’s somewhat afraid (< ?usru’ka he’s afraid
              + -§a)
   (28) -&t?e “very much”               (prob. < -Sa + -i?e, aug. suff.), used
with adjectives and with non-inchoative static verb forms, e.g.,
          ra’ st?e very hard (< ra’ hard + -8?e)
          lo't ?iwa'nast?é.    I want very much               to run.        (#wa'nast?e
                   < ?iwa'na I want + -st?e)
   (29) -Sto’hku       “fairly, quite,      a little bit’? (prob. < -Sa + -to’h-
ku, dim. suff.), used with adjectives and adverbs, e.g.,
         ta'wisthé, ru'winasto ya'téhé (38:b) when they make the water a
               little bit warm (ru’winasto(hku) < ru’wina hot, warm
                   + -sto’hku)
          ro'hpanstohk ?u'k?ik?%thé (14a:%0) if you sit quite close (ra’h-
               pansto'hku < ro’hpan close + -sto’hku)
   (30)   -le’he “right, precisely,’’ occurring but rarely, e.g.,
           la'pule'hén, ?uwi'rahk?uta’nt  (21:d) he questioned him thor-
                oughly. (la’pule’he < la’pu good + -le’he)
          hi'héile’hén, po'wthé (9:h) when he looked right there                     (hi’h-
                Gile’he < hi'h& there + -le’he)
124                                     HAAS     TUNICA                           9.36         OBSCURE       POSTFIXES
   There are a few postfixes which occur only once or twice in the
available material. Some of these are probably archaic and most
of them are of doubtful meaning.
   (31) -we, prob. an archaic exhortative postf., occurring in two
identical examples, viz., sa’kunawé (224:f, 22B:f) which the in-
formant translated as ‘‘Let’s eat!” If the first person dual is im-
plied it should be sa’k?inawé and the form as dictated is apparently
incorrect. In corroboration of this we find that Gatschet wrote the
form as sa’kinawe ! and, since he did not record glottal stops, we
may read his form as sa’k?inawe < sa'k?ina “we eat’? + -we.
    (82) -yo, of no certain meaning, occurring only in the word
 ?7’mayo (4A:ar, 4B:ap, 4B:aq, 4B:ar) with the meaning “‘It is I”
(< ?¢’ma, 1s pron., + -yo).
    (33) -tan, some kind of subordinating postf. In the only two
instances of its occurrence it is translated once as ‘‘after’’ and once
as “while,” e.g., 2a’m?uhkitan (4a:p) “after he had gone” (< ?a’m-
?uhki “he had gone” + -tan); hi’htin, ?u'natan (4a:bd) “‘while
he lived there” (?u'natan < ?u’na “he lived” + -tan).
   (84) An element -at (or possibly -hat, though apparently unre-
lated to no. 21) is used once with a verb form, viz., po’nihcét (30)
“when I looked” (< po’ni “I looked” + -héi + -at or -hat). It is
assumed that -hci may be the unapocopated form of -hé (no. 4
above) but it has not been possible to establish a meaning for -at
or -hat; note that po’nihé (< po’ni + -hé) would mean ‘“‘when I
looked.”
   (35)   In one case an element -?aha is used in a context which
does not require a negative (see no. 18). In this case it has seemed
appropriate     to render         the    element        as    ‘“‘indeed,”’   viz.,    te’hé?ehé,
?o’wand (13:y) “It is she, indeed, (that) I want.” (ti’héehe < ta’h-
i, 3FS8 pron., + -?aha). Though the same form could mean “‘it is
not she,” such a rendition would not fit the context.
                    9.37      ORDER            OF THE        POSTFIXES
   In certain cases more than one postfix is attached to the same
word and in this event their order is fixed. Note the following
rules. The references are to 9.32, 9.33 and 9.34:
   Rule 1. The quotative postfix -a’ni (no. 6) follows any other
postfix which is used with the same word, e.g.,
          lu'piwik?ahéa'nt.   (42H) He will die, it is said.                         (< lu’piwt
               + -k?ahéa, fut. postf., no. 12, + -a’nz)
          sinsa'kutche'ni.         (44:1)       She   did     not   eat   them,      it is   said.
               (< stnsa’kuli + -aha, neg. postf., no. 16, + -a’nz)

              liwi + -k?aha, neg. postf., no. 17, + -a’nz)
         ?0'rus?aha'ni. (48:a}) He did not know, it is said. (< ?0’rusa
              + -?aha, neg. postf., no. 18, + -a’nz)
         ?o'nip?aha'ni.    (4a:an) There were no people, it is said.
               (< ?0’ni + -p?aha, neg. postf., no. 19, + -a’nz)
         tthpo’wistuk?oho'ni.     (7a:c)   He    could not find her, it is said.
               (< tihpo'wi + -stuk?oho, neg. postf., no. 20, + -a’nt)
   Rule 2. The interrogative postfix -n (no. 7) follows any other
postfix which is used with the same word, e.g.,
         ka’ 2a, ya'k?tk?ahéan.    (11B:b) When will you come back?
               (ya'k?ik?ahcan < ya’k?i + -k?ahca, fut. postf., no. 12,
               + -n)
         ?unpo'?ehén.     (13:ag)    Didn’t      you     see    them?   (< ?unpo'?
               + -aha, neg. postf., no. 16, + -n)
         ta’yiwe’ han?’ stahé, po’ %k?ahdn. (13:aj) You don’t see a blue
               light, (do you)? (po’?tk?ahan < po'?i + -k?aha, neg. postf.,
               no. 17, + -n)
   Rule 3. The imperative postfix -tan (no. 11) follows the nega-
tive postfix -?aha (no. 18) when the two are used in forming the
prohibitive, e.g., ?ira’p?ahatdén. (10:e) Do not kill me! (< ?¢ra’-
pa + -?aha + -tan).
   Rule 4. The negative postfix -?aha (no. 18) follows the future
subjunctive postfix -k (no. 15), e.g., hopi’wik?ahdn, ?unt’wihkt.
(4a:v) You told him not to come out. (hopi’wik?aha < hopt’wi +
-k + -?aha).
   Rule 5. The subordinating postfix -hé (no. 4) follows the con-
ditional postfix -k?2 or -?2 (no. 13), e.g., we’yak?thé (20:e) if you
proceed (< wi’ya + -k?2 + -hé).
   Rule 6. The conditional postfix -/?2 or -?2 (no. 13) follows the
negative postfixes -aha (no. 16) and -k?aha (no. 17), e.g.,
        ka’kiin, hu'mara ya'weh?ihé (1) should anyone not have fasted
              (ya'weh?thé < ya'wi + -aha + -?¢ + -hé)
        lo'tantk?ahak?thé (non-text) if I don’t run (< lo’tani + -k?aha
               + -k9i + -hé)
    Other combinations of postfixes may be possible but they do not
occur in the available material. Note that rule no. 1 does not con-
flict with the other rules for the following reasons: (1) The quota-
tive postfix may not be used in direct discourse whereas the inter-
rogative postfix (rule 2) and the imperative postfix -tan (rule 3)
may be used only in that way. (2) The quotative postfix may like-
wise not be used in indirect discourse whereas the future subjunc-
tive postfix -k (rule 4) may be used only in that way.      (3) The
quotative postfix may further be used only in main clauses
whereas the conditional postfix (rules 5 and 6) and the subordinat-
ing postfix (rule 5) may be used only in subordinate clauses.

                                         10.11      NOUNS   In connection with the discussion devoted to noun inflection
(4.81) it is pointed out that there are two primary noun categories,
the indeterminative and the determinative.          In addition it is
shown that the determinative category is subdivided into three
case categories, the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.
In this section it is shown how these various categories are used.
   Nouns in the indeterminative category or in the definitive case
of the determinative category are used in the following ways:
(1) as predicative words, e.g.,
           ?u'w Pone'nt          (6c:a) he was a person              (?one'ni < ?0'ni a per-
                son + -a’nt)
           Puha'yikti. (13:g) It is the old man.
(2) as independent subjects of predications, e.g.,
           no'kus ka’l?ura'nt              (20:b) a bear was standing                 (no’kusi a
                   bear)
           to'niku ?uya'nako'nt.            (20:e) The man spoke to it.              (to’niku the
                   man)
(3) as independent objects of transitive                             and    transimpersonal
active verbs and of static verbs, e.g.,
           Ci'yan,       ?uwe'n?uhke'ni           (20:a)     he   found    a squirrel       (’ya
                   a squirrel)
           ta'nardku,       ?uhka’hawthé (148:b) when he met the snake (éa’-
                   naraku the snake)
               ?o'hayahtet, no'kusta’witin,          tihpt'r?ake'ni.       (4B:cc)    His sister,
                   on her part, became a woodcock.                  (?0’hayahéet his sister, on
                her part)
           ta’rustak ?u’ Sepa’ni.                (14a:h) Rabbit was glad.             (ta’rustaku
                Rabbit)
(4) as complements of impersonal                            and   transimpersonal         active
verbs and of static verbs, e.g.,
               ti'hika ta’ythkin, yu’ katihé (12:d) when seven years had passed
                 < when it reached seven years (ti’hika year)
           ta’hé?thé, tihpt'r?ake'nt.    (38:d) She became the Sun.                        (ta’hé-
                 ether the Sun)                                                             ;
           ?o'hoyahé, 2uspi't?oke'nt.       (non-text) He forgot his                       sister.
                 (?0'hayaher his sister)
      Nouns in the non-definitive case of the determinative category
are    often     found     to occur       in uses     no.    2 and     3 above       if they   are
modified by a quantificative (see 10.21), e.g.,
         ?u’sa_sa’hkiin, wa’hako'nt    (19:g) one (of) his dogs                            yelped
              (?u’sa his dcg, modified by sa’hku one)
             HANDBOOK         OF   AMERICAN      INDIAN     LANGUAGES            127
In addition nouns in the non-definitive case of the determinative
category are used in the following way:
(5) as objects of postpositions, e.g.,
           Si'mina’?ard, ta’hahéu ha'yiht’       (78:b)    they are playing on the
                 sand     (ta’hahéu the sand, obj. of postp. ha’ythta on)
   Nouns in the locative case of the determinative category are
used as follows:
(6)    as modifiers of auxiliary and active verbs, e.g.,
            ?u’ri§ 2ata'nit. (4a:ae) She went to his house. (?u’rist to his
                 house, modifier of ?ata’ni, aux. vb.)
           ta’haltan, u'h?uhke'ni    (4a‘:az) he spat on the ground        (ta’-
                 halta on the ground, modifier of ¢u’h?uhke'’nt, act. vb.)            10.12       THE   INDEPENDENT        PERSONAL     PRONOUNS
   The independent personal pronouns are inflected for person,
gender, and number (4.22) but do not have special forms distin-
guished as to the indeterminative and determinative categories as
nouns do. They are used as substitutes for nouns and hence,
except for the fact that they do not occur in the locative case
(noun use no. 6), they may be used in all the ways that nouns are
used, €.g.,
           ?u'wiehé     (19:e) it is not he        (< ?u'wi, 3ms, + -?aha, neg.
                postf.; predicative word)
           ?u'w 2one'nt        (6c:a)   he was   a person      (?u’wi; independent
                subject)
           se’man, stya'n?uhke'ni (Qin) he spoke to them                (se’ma, 3MP;
                independent object)
            ?1’man, wispt'tutik?ahéd.      (13:am) You will forget me.        (?2’ma,
                 1s; predicate complement)
            ?7’ma rao'hpant ?u’k?@ihcan.   (14B:0) You must            sit near me.
                 (?2’ma; obj. of the postp. ro’hpant near)
   Other special points regarding the use of the independent per-
sonal pronouns follow:
      (1) They   are used as substitutes only for animate               nouns    and
must agree with them in gender and number (see 8.22).
   (2) Since all verbs contain pronominal referentials it is not
necessary to employ an independent personal pronoun as inde-
pendent subject or object unless there is a shift in the animate
referred to. In other words, once the characters are established
in the context by means of nominal referees, the independent per-
sonal pronouns are used in cases like the following:
            ka’na la’pu yu'k?éné, la’pu sa’k?ik?ahed, 2uni’kate’ni.           hinya'-
                 tthé, ?u'win, pa’kahk?uta'ni. ta’hein, ya'nakate'ni.         ?u'win,
                 pa'kahk?u't?una’ni. (4a:d) “If I cook something good, you
                 shall eat well (of it),’’ she told him. Now he replied. She
                 was talking.      He was replying.       (?u’wi, 3ms; t2’hct, 3Fs)
128                                  HAAS     TUNICAHere we have a man and a woman established as the characters
in the context. Each time the interest shifts from the one to the
other the appropriate pronoun is used to call attention to the shift.
Similar examples are the following:
          ?4’man, tt'ri§ na’ ?and, ma’?an, 2a’hkis na’ 2k? thé, la'puhé, ?uni’-
               kate'nt. (4a:g) “If I lie to the front and if you lie to the
               back, it will be a good thing,” she told him. (?2’ma, 1s;
               ma’ 2s)
          sinsto'hk?oke'nt. (4aray) hinya’tthé, ?u'win, 2e’ruko'ni. (44:82)
               They got tired. Then he was laughing. (?u’w7, 3ms)         10.13      THE    INTERROGATIVE-INDEFINITE               PRONOUNS   The interrogative-indefinite pronouns are ka’ku “who, some-
one, anyone” and ka’nahku “what, something, anything.”’ The
former is a masculine singular but the latter is genderless and
numberless. They are used as substitutes for nouns with the fol-
lowing restrictions: (1) They do not occur in the locative case,
noun use no. 6, and (2) ka’nahku does not occur as independent
subject, noun use no. 2. Note also that when ka’nahku occurs as
independent object, the verb never takes an objective pronomi-
nal referential (see third example below). Examples:
           ka’nahkiin.     (11a:e) What is it?           (< ka’nahku + -n, interrog.
                  postf.; predicative word)
           ka’k sihpe Pun.           (33:a) Someone has seen me.       (ka’ku; indep.

           ka'na ra'p?dné (9:4) if I kill something (ka’na(hku) ; indep. obj.)
           ka'nahk ?unpi’ratik?ahca’ni = =(8a:b) they would turn into
                  something       < it    would   turn   them   into something   (ka’-
                  nahku; predicate complement)                              10.2       QUANTIFICATIVES
   10.21 Quantificatives include the numerals (5.9) and other
quantifiers such as ho’tu “all, everything’; na’mu “many, much”;
ka’ sku “‘a few, a little bit”; ka’Skuto’hku “several, quite a few”;
2a’mari “enough.” ! These words are used as follows:
(1) as minimal clauses, e.g.,
           sahkiin, %'lin, 2e'nthkin, ni'wthé (16:1) when he said “one,
                two, three” (sa’hku one; ?2/li two; ?e’nthku three)
 (2) as substitutes for nouns in all the ways the latter are used
 except no. 6 (10.11), e.g.,
           hthé ?a’mart.          (14B:y) That’s enough.        (?a’mart; predicative
                  word)
           sa’hkun, ya’n?uhke'ni.           (5a:b) One spoke.    (sa’hku; independent
                subject)
 * The word ?a’mart differs from other quantificatives in that it may also be used as
  & comparative    (see 10.42).
            HANDBOOK       OF   AMERICAN       INDIAN   LANGUAGES                129          ho'tuin, stra'’p?onta'ni (20:})      they killed them   all    (ho’tu all;
                independent object)
          sa’hkun, wiwa'nak?ihé (13:w) if you want one (sa’hku,; predi-
               cate complement)
(3) as modifiers of nouns, e.g.,
          ti’hika ta’yihktn, yu’ katthé (12:d) when seven years had passed
                (ta’ythku seven, modifier of t2’hika year)
          to’kate’kaha   ma’nkin,    ?u’k?e%era'ni.     (9:a)   Once    there   were
               four orphan boys.       (ma'nku four, modifier of to’kate’kaha
               the orphan boy)If the quantificative modifies a noun used in the definitive case, it
is usually incorporated within the noun complex, i.e., stands be-
tween the noun stem and its gender-number suffix (cf. the treat-
ment of adjectives; 10.41), e.g.,
          ?uhk?o'katohk?1'l?uniman, ?unya’nako'ni. (44:be) He spoke to
               his two boys. (?uhk?o'katohk?1'l?unima < ?uhk-, 3Ms pref.,
               + ?0’kato’hku child + ?2'l¢ two + -?u’nima, mp sufi.)(4) as modifiers of active verbs, indicating the number of times
an event takes place, e.g.,
          ta’hahku ha’ ytht, 2e’nthku pe'kawe'ni. (13:t) he rapped on the
               cypress trees three times (?e’nthku three; three times)   10.22 In addition to the words mentioned above we find that
the word sa’hu ‘‘other’”’ is best classified as a quantificative even
though it may not be employed in uses no. 1 and 4 above. When
used as a noun substitute (use no. 2 above) it takes either the ms
or the Fs gender-number suffix depending on the gender classifica-
tion of the noun for which it is substituted,’ e.g.,
          sa’ hiku, ti’hika& ?a’m?uhke'nt.       (8a:d) The other went to the
               south. (sa’huku < sa’hu + -ku, Ms suff.; substituted for a
               masc. noun; independent subject)
          sa'hihé, tiya'nakate'nt. (44:ax) She spoke to the other. (sa’-
                huhci < sa’hu + -hét, Fs suff.; substituted for a fem. noun;
               independent object)The word is also used as a noun modifier (use no. 3 above) and in
this event it is always incorporated within the noun complex like
an adjective, e.g.,
          ta’ herit?esa'huhé, hana’ ?ake'ni.   (228:c) The other boat stopped.
               (ta’herit?esa’huhti < ta’-, art. pref., + he’rit?e large boat
               + sa’hu + -hét)1 Whether or not sa/hu could also be used with the masculine and feminine dual
  and plural gender-number suffixes is not known but no such examples occur in
  the available material.
 130                                HAAS     TUNICA    10.23   Like sa’hu, ?a’m?ilta “‘both’’ is best classified as a quan-
 tificative even though it may be used only in use no. 2 above, e.g.,
            2a'milta, ?unka'l?utéhé (6c:a) when he had created them both
                 (?a’m?ilta, independent object)                             10.3     POSTPOSITIONS    The postpositions (see 5.61 and 5.8) govern substantives in the
 formation of postpositional phrases. These are used as locative
 predicate modifiers, e.g.,
            2¢’ma ra'hpant   ?u'k?ihcén.        (148:0)      You   must   sit near me.
                 (ro’hpant near, governing          ?7’ma,   1s pron.; postp.   phrase
                 modifying ?u’k?chéan)
            ta’hal?u’kini ki’ Gin, stha’l?uhke’nt (4a:k) he sent them into
                 the town (kz’éu in, into, governing ta’hal?u’kini the town;
                 postp. phrase modifying stha’l?uhke'nt)                              10.4         MopIFIEers                             10.41         ADJECTIVES
      Adjectives may be used in the following ways:
(1) as predicative words, e.g.,
            S'htuna’ni   (8a:a) it was dark          (< s¢’htuna dark + -a’ni)
(2)    as modifiers of nouns used as predicative words, e.g.,
           te’Caku, ku'wa lapo'nt. (43a:b) The crow woodpecker is a good
                 ey      (lapa'ni < la’pu good + -a’ni, modifying ku'wa
                bird
(3) as modifiers of the interrogative-indefinite pronoun ka’nahku
“something, anything,” e.g.,
           ka’na la’pu yu'k?éné (4a:d) if I cook something good (la’pu,
                modifying ka’nahku), but this usage may be a case of
                idiomatic borrowing from the English expression ‘‘some-
                thing good.”
  As would be expected, adjectives are also used as modifiers of
nouns other than those used as predicative words (use no. 2
above), but in this event the adjective is incorporated in the
houn complex, i.e., stands between the noun and its gender-
suffix when the latter is used. Such formations are structurally
identical with noun plus adjective composites (5.432), e.g.,
           to’mahkami'liku (1) the red alligator (< t-, art. pref., + 20’-
                mahka alligator + m2’lt red + -ku, Ms suff.)
           ta'yorum?ahawi'ratahasi'nima (18:a) some fearful wild beasts
                (< ta’- + yo'rum?aha         wild    beast + wi’rataha      fearful +
               -st'nima, FD-P suff.)
          HANDBOOK        OF    AMERICAN      INDIAN       LANGUAGES               131
   There is one special adjectival form which is always used as a
predicative word, viz., la’puhé “it is good” (< la’pu good +a
suff. -hé of unknown        connotation).          This    word     is used    as the
equivalent of a number of English expressions, such as, ‘“‘it is
good”’; “it will, would be good”’; “it will, would be nice’’; ‘“‘it will,
would be a good thing.” It is widely used in direct quotations as
the resolution for conditional or concessive clauses, e.g.,
         Pusu’ ik?thé, la’puhé, 2u'neka'ni.     (10:e) “If you shoot it, it
               will be a good thing,” he told him.
         Ip't?ek?thé, la'’puhé, 2u'niko'ni.   (19:f) “You had better run
                < if you run, it will be good,” he told him.","[117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130]"
"‘The material presented here was obtained in two ways: (1) from tonal notes
 made directly from the dictation of the informant and (2) from somewhat more
 detailed tonal notes based on phonograph recordings of Tunica speech. The
 phonograph recordings, however, are not of the best quality and some words
 are too blurred for identification.    Hence the sort of detailed study that I had
 hoped to make was not possible on the basis of these recordings. However, since
 the results obtained from direct dictation are in close agreement with those ob-
  tained from the phonographic study, it seems reasonable to suppose that the
  description presented here is sufficiently accurate to serve the general purpose

20                                         HAAS   TUNICAHere ta’- is roughly a major second higher than any succeeding
syllable except -¢dé which in turn is roughly a minor third higher
than any preceding syllable except ta’-.                      The intervening syllables
(including the stressed.-ra’p-) are uttered on a monotone.
    (2) When the falling melody is used the ultima starts about a
minor third higher than the penultima and then slides quickly
downward about a perfect fourth or fifth. In other respects the
contour of this type of phrase is like that of one having a high
melody. Example: ?a’hkig ma’r?1ki (4a:bg) ‘““Go back!”
    (3) When the low melody is used the ultima is pitched about a
perfect fourth or fifth lower than the last stressed syllable which in
turn is pitched about a minor third higher than the immediately
preceding syllables. Any unstressed syllables coming between the
last stressed syllable and the ultima have the same pitch as the
latter. The first stressed syllable (unless it is also the last stressed
syllable) is ordinarily pitched a major second higher than any
succeeding syllable except the last stressed syllable. The interven-
ing     syllables     are     monotonous.             Example:        ?u’rig   ma’r?uwa'ni
(7a:c) ‘‘He went back home, they say.”
    (4) When the rising melody is used the ultima starts about a
perfect fourth or fifth lower than the last stressed syllable and
then slides quickly upward about a minor third. In all other re-
spects (including the pitch of the last stressed syllable) the con-
tour of this type of phrase is like that of one having the low mel-
ody. Example: lo’ta wiwa’ndn (16:h) ‘Do you want to run?”
   (5) The falling-rising melody consists of a quick drop of a per-
fect fourth or so followed by a quick rise of a minor third. This
melody occurs only with the one monosyllabic word hén ‘‘Yes.”’                             2.          PHONOMECHANICS
                                  2.1     GENERAL     REMARKS
   On the phonemic level the smallest phonetic group is the
phrase. On the phonomechanical (phonological) level, however,
it is possible to distinguish between the word and the phrase on
the basis of certain differences between internal sandhi (phono-
mechanical          changes         operating     when      grammatical        elements   are
combined       into     words)            and   external     sandhi    (phonomechanical
changes operating when words are combined into phrases).","[18, 19]"
"                             4.74   NEGATIVE   FORMS
     The negative non-inchoative forms are built up by adding the
negative postfix -?aha (9.34, no. 18) to the positive forms, e.g.,
          Piya’ §2ehé.   I am not angry < ?cya’si        Iam angry + -?aha
          2usre’p2aha'ni.  (4B:w) he was not pleased < ?u§?e'pa he is,
               was pleased -++ -?aha + -a’ni, quot. postf.
The negative inchoative forms, on the other hand, are constructed
like the negative forms of active verbs (4.55), e.g.,
         ?uya’ Sitehé. He did not get angry < ?uya’ sit he got angry
               + -aha
          ?uya’ Sitik?ahd.      He does not get angry < ?uya’ sitt + -k?aha
The reason for this is to be found in the fact that the positive in-
choative forms of static verbs are constructed by the use of ele-
ments normally employed by active verbs (4.731).",[61]

                         1.23         THE     PHRASAL        PHONEMES      The vowel of the ultima, or, in certain instances, the vowel of
the penultima, of the last word in every phrase is subjected to one
of the following phrase-final melodies:
   (1) High, orthographically indicated by an acute sign (’) placed
over the vowel,! e.g., ha’raku “‘he sings.”
   (2) Low, indicated by a grave sign (*), e.g., ha’rako’ni “he
would sing, they say.”’
   (3) Rising, indicated by an inverted circumflex (‘), e.g., ?2’-
mapdn “I, too.”
   (4) Falling, indicated by a circumflex (‘), e.g., &u’&?7ki “Shoot!”
   (5) Falling-rising, indicated by a circumflex plus an inverted
circumflex (~), e.g., hén “Yes.”
   In case the ultimate vowel is u preceded by k or hk, the low and
rising melodies may be placed, if desired, on the penultimate
vowel, e.g., to’niku “the man,” la’hontdhku ‘very early’; in
this event the u is unvoiced.                      The remaining melodies are placed1 Note that the diacritics indicating the melodies are placed over the vowel while
     the one indicating stress is placed after the vowel.

on     the    ultimate       vowel        without         exception,   e.g.,   pi’taku   “he
walks.” ?","[13, 14]"
"        4.54      THE   INFLECTION      OF   CAUSATIVE    ACTIVE      VERBS   4.541  The inflection of causative verb stems is normally peri-
phrastic. Their semelfactive, habitual, and conditional paradigms
require the use of the causative auxiliary. Other types of peri-
Phrastic inflection. (involving the use of the other auxiliaries) are
also possible with causative stems provided they are extended by
means of the causative thematic suffix -n (5.212). The infinitive
form of a causative verb is likewise extended by -n or its variant
-nt. Note that the causative auxiliary and the causative suffix are
mutually exclusive although no causative verb form is correctly
Inflected unless one or the other of these elements is employed.
   In the following sections a causative stem is indicated by the
device illustrated in ?u’ki..c., which is to be read ?u’ki, causative
verb stem.
  _4.542   The rules for the construction of the normal semelfac-
tive, habitual, and conditional paradigms of causative verbs are
as follows:
52                                 HAAS   TUNICA   (1) The semelfactive paradigm consists of a causative stem plus
the semelfactive forms of the causative auxiliary (4.426), e.g.,
             Puhk?u'k?utahé (44:0) when he had put him (lit., caused him to
                  sit) < ?uhk-, 3ms pref., + ?u’/ki..c. to cause . . . to sit
                  (hence, “‘to put, place, set .. .”) + -?u’ta, 3ms smlf.,
                  + -hé, subord. postf.
             ?uhpi hust’ntak?ahca (4B:ax) they would hide him (lit., cause
                  him to hide) < ?uhk- + pi’hu..c. to cause . . . to hide
                  (bence, “to hide . . .”) + -st’nta, 3Fp-P smlf., + -k?ahéa,
                  fut. postf.
   (2) The habitual paradigm consists of a causative habitual
theme (< a caus. stem + the hab. suff. -hk-) plus the semelfactive
forms of the causative auxiliary, e.g.,
             tuhke’pahk?uta'ni. (43c) he is marrying her off (lit., causing her
                  to marry) < tihk-, 3Fs pref., + kz’pa..c. to cause . . . to
                  marry (hence, “to marry . . . off’) + -hk- + -?u'ta, 3ms
                  smlf., + -a’nt, quot. postf.
             tthe'yahk?ata'ni.   (4B:ba) she would wake her up (lit., cause her
                  to awake) < tihk- + hi'ya..c. to cause... to awake
                  (hence, “to wake... up”) + -hk- + -?a’ta, 3rs smlf.,
                  + -a’ni
   (3) The conditional paradigm consists of a causative stem plus
the conditional forms of the causative auxiliary (4.44), e.g.,
             Puhka'liwi't?ahé (7a:e) if you place it (lit., cause it to stand)
                  < ?uhk- + ka’li..c. to cause . .. to stand (hence, ‘‘to
                  put, place, stand   . . .””) + -wi’t?a, 2ms cond., + -hé
     4.543    In a very few abnormal instances the semelfactive para-
digm of a causative verb is derived from a causative theme (caus.
stem + caus. suff. -n) plus the semelfactive              inflectional endings
normally used only with non-causative stems (4.521),! e.g.,
             ?uhpi'hunsi’nak?ahéa (44:ba) they would hide him (lit., cause
                   him to hide) < ?uhk-+ pi‘’hu..c. to hide...+-n
                   + -st’na, 3FD smIf. endg., + -k?ahéa, fut. postf.
             ttyo'lansi'tihé (4B:aq) when they turned her loose (lit., caused
                   her to get loose) < tthk- + yo'la..c. to cause . . . to get
                   loose (hence, “to turn . . . loose’) + -n + -si’ti, 3FP smilf.
                  endg., + -hé
But in different tellings of the same myth the informant uses the
correct forms of both of the above cases, viz.,
             ?uhpi'husi'ntak?ahéa (4B:ax) < ?uhk- + pi'hu..c. + -st’nta,
                   3FD-P of the caus. aux., + -k?ahca
             tiyo'lasi’ntahé (4atat) < tihk- + yo'la. .c. + -si’nta + -hé
1 Instances of the type illustrated here are undoubtedly analogical. Throughout
  the whole of the texts they do not occur over a dozen times as against more than
 two hundred cases of regular causative semelfactive inflection in accordance
 with rule (1) above.
               HANDBOOK        OF   AMERICAN         INDIAN       LANGUAGES                   53     4.544     When the non-causative auxiliaries are used with causa-
 tive verb stems, their special meanings are the same as when they
 are used with non-causative stems (4.53). The following forma-
 tional rules apply under these circumstances:
    (1) To form the semelfactive, repetitive, or conditional para-
 digms    causative theme (caus. stem + caus. suff. -n) is placed in
 front of the appropriate form of the given non-causative auxiliary,
 e.£-,
             sinha’ pan?uhke'ni.   (19:j) he has stopped them (lit., caused
                   them to stop) < sink-, 3rp-P pref., + ha’pa..c. to cause
                   . .. to stop (hence, “to stop .. .”) +-n + ?whki, 3ms
                  smlf., + -a'ni (cf. 4.532)
             ?uhta'kan?u’rana'ni.        (7B:c)      they     were      chasing    it < ?uhk-
                  + ta’ka..c. to chase            ...+-n-+            ?u’rana,    3mp    smlf.,
                  + -a’ni (ef. 4.533)
             ha'ran?una’nt.     (15:d) he played (lit., caused it to sing) < ha’-
                  ra..c.   to cause    . . . to sing        (hence,    “to play an instru-
                  ment’’) + -n + ?u'na, 3ms smlf., + -a’ni (ef. 4.533)
             we'ran?u'?uwa'ni. (11a:a) he used to go hunting < we'ra. .c.
                  to hunt + -n + ?u’?uwa, 3s repet., + -a’'ni (cf. 4.534)
             we'ran?r'yan?Ghé       (4B:w)   if we     go     hunting     < we'ra..c. +-n
                  + ?’yan?a, 1p cond., + -hé (ef. 4.534)
    (2) To form a habitual paradigm involving the employment of a
 non-causative auxiliary, double periphrasis is sometimes used.
 Thus a causative habitual theme (caus. stem + hab. suff. -hk-)
may be followed by a semelfactive form of the causative auxiliary
which in turn may be followed by a semelfactive form of a non-
causative auxiliary. Both auxiliaries are inflected in the same
person, gender, and number. The following illustrate all the types
of examples that occur:
             pa'kahk?u't?una’ni.   (4a:d) he was replying < pa’ka..c. to
                  reply + -hk- + -?u’ta, 3ms smlf., + ?u’na, 3ms_ smlif,,
                  + -a’ni
             ?u’ruhk?u't?usa’nt. (8a:e) he was whooping as he came < ?u’-
                 ru. .c. to whoop + -hk- + -?u’ta + ?u’sa, 3ms smlf.,                   + -a’ni
             ?u'ruhk?u't?uwa'nt.      (8B:d) He was whooping as he went < ?u’-
                 ru..c. + -hk- + -?u'ta + ?u'wa, 3ms smlf., + -a’ni
There is also one text example in which the second auxiliary is in
the repetitive aspect, viz.,
             ?u'ruhk?u’t?u?uwa'nt.       (8a:f)    He keeps whooping              as he goes
                  < ?u’ru..c. + -hk- + -?u’ta + ?u’?uwa, 3ms repet.,                    + -a’ni
Although examples of double periphrasis are rare, the following
Tule apparently governs its use: Whenever it is desired to use the
 abitual suffix -hk- with a causative stem, it is necessary to employ
the causative auxiliary 1 and then if it is desired to express an addi-
en
* Because the causative suffix and the habitual suff
                                                     ix may not both be appended
  to the sam e stem (5.213).
54                                HAAS    TUNICAtional notion normally indicated by a non-causative auxiliary, the
latter auxiliary may follow the causative one, as in the examples
quoted above.     The paucity of examples of double periphrasis
seems to be caused by a certain reluctance on the part of the in-
formant to use the process. Thus it turns out that causative stems
usually exhibit no difference between the immutable and the mu-
table duratives (4.532). Since the mutable durative requires the
use of the habitual suffix, its occurrence with causative stems
would call for double periphrasis. But because of the informant’s
tendency to avoid the process an immutable durative is often
found where one would expect a mutable durative, as in pa’-
kan?una'ni (4B:d) “he was replying,’ used in place of the more
correct pa'kahk?u't?una’ni (4a:d). At other times the informant
tries to get around the situation by using an incorrect form involv-
ing the use of the habitual suffix and the complete omission of
any element indicative of causativity, e.g., ku’hpahk?u’rana'ni
(10:d) as against ku’hpan?u'rana'ni (4a:aj) ‘they were feather-
ing (arrows),” and é0’luhk?una’ni (54:a) as against ¢o’lun?una'ni
(5a:b) “it was dripping (down).”’ It seems likely that both alter-
natives for each example are incorrectly used in place of forms in-
volving double periphrasis, viz., *ku’hpahk?u'nt?urana’ni and
*(o'luhk?u’t?una’ni, respectively.
   4.545 The following synopsis of 3mMs subjective forms shows
the principal differences in inflection between the non-causative
and causative categories. The prefix tzhk-, occurring with the caus-
ative examples, is the 3rs alienable pronominal prefix used as
direct object (4.56).

          4.55    THE    NEGATIVE       PARADIGMS     OF   ACTIVE    VERBS
     The negative paradigms of active verbs are formed by means of
the negative postfixes -aha (9.34, no. 16) and -k?aha (9.34, no. 17).
On the formal level both of these postfixes must be added to the
non-periphrastic semelfactive paradigms of non-causative verbs
(4.521)     or to the regular       semelfactive      paradigms      of causative
              HANDBOOK       OF   AMERICAN     INDIAN      LANGUAGES              55verbs (4.542, rule 1). However, on the functional level the ele-
ment -aha is used to form what may be called the negative semel-
factive paradigm of active verbs while the element -k?aha is used
to form what may be called the negative habitual paradigm of
active verbs. The following synopsis illustrates the difference be-
tween the positive and negative forms of these verbs.

lo'tawik?aha “he does not run” is < lo’tawi + -k?aha.     Further
examples of the negative semelfactive and habitual forms of active
verbs are given in 9.34.","[50, 51, 52, 53, 54]"
"                      4.523    The    Conditional    Set   The conditional endings may be appended to any non-causative
active verb stem to form its conditional paradigm. These endings
are based on the semelfactive endings in much the same way that
the conditional paradigms of auxiliary verbs are based on their
semelfactive paradigms (4.44). Note the following rules:
   (1) With the exception of the 1s, 2mMs, and 2¥Fs forms, the con-
ditional endings are formed by inserting the conditional infix -?-
between the last consonant and vowel of the semelfactive endings,
e.g.,          -w?t, 3Ms cond. endg. (-w7, 3ms smlf. endg.)
          -?1'n?a, 1p cond. endg. (-?2’na, 1p smlf. endg.)
          -si't?7, 3FP cond. endg. (-s7’t7, 3FP smif. endg.)     (2) The 1s conditional ending -?an consists of a special condi-
tional infix -?a- plus the semelfactive ending -nz which is always
apocopated to -n in this case.
   (3) The 2ms and 2¥s forms, which are -?2k?1 and -?ak?1, re-
spectively, consist of their corresponding semelfactive endings
plus the conditional postfix -27.
   Note also that with the exception of the 2ms and 2rs forms
(whose only conditionals are non-fusional) there are alternative
non-fusional conditionals for the rest of the forms. These consist
of the semelfactive endings plus the conditional postfix -&?: and
may be used in place of any of the fusional endings described under
the first two rules above. In contrast to what is true of the condi-
tionals of auxiliary verbs, however, the fusional forms are used
much more widely than are the equivalent non-fusional forms.
            HANDBOOK         OF   AMERICAN    INDIAN    LANGUAGES            49   4.538     THE   PERIPHRASTIC INFLECTION             OF NON-CAUSATIVE
                             ACTIVE VERBS
  4.531      In the      periphrastic   inflection   of non-causative   active
verbs any auxiliary except the causative may be employed.                    In
such 2 case the auxiliary follows the active verb stem and the two
are combined according to the regular rules of assimilation (2.23)
and syncope (2.24). The auxiliary undergoes its normal inflec-
tion and the pronominal subject of the complex is indicated by
the auxiliary.     In their independent usage auxiliaries cannot ap-
pear in the habitual aspect (4.41).             In their periphrastic usage,
however, this aspect is expressed by placing a semelfactive form of
the auxiliary after a habitual theme (< an active verb stem + the
habitual thematic suffix -hk-, 5.213). This rule applies in the case
of all of the auxiliaries except ?u’hkz which, on its part, is never
used with a habitual theme.
   When the auxiliaries are used in periphrastic inflection their
primary meanings are largely obscured. Certain ones of them are
used to express the secondary verbal categories which include the
past tense     (4.532)     and the immutable         and mutable    duratives
(4.533). These categories are secondary for two reasons, (1) they
are not obligatory and (2) they cannot be expressed without the
inclusion of one of the primary categories. The special function of
each auxiliary when it is used in periphrasis is discussed in the
following sections.
   4.5382 The auxiliary ?u’hki “he is, was’ (4.421) is regularly
employed to express the notion of priority in'time. It covers the
simple past, the present perfect, and the past perfect tenses of
English. Examples:
           ?unt'wihkt.     (4a:v) you told him < ?uhk-, 3Ms pref., + nz’ to
                tell + w2i’hki, 2ms smlf.
           ya'kfahkint. (7B:e) I have come < ya’ka to come + ?a’hkini,
                ls smlf.
           ka'ta ya'k?akthé (9:m) whence she had come; ya’k?akihé
                 < ya’ka + ?a’ki, 3¥s smlf., + -hé, subord. postf.
           €u'?u?uhke'ni. (421) he always took < éu’ to take + ?u’?uhki,
                 3MS repet., + -a’n2, quot. postf.
           ra’ paw’ hk?thé (19: c) if you have killed < ra’pa to kill + w’hk-
                 27, 2Ms cond., + -hé
  4.533      The positional auxiliaries,        ?«’ra “he lies, lay”    (4.422)
and ?u'na “he sits, sat’ (4.423), are used periphrastically to ex-
Press two types of duratives, the immutable and the mutable. In
expressing the immutable durative either of the positionals may be
added to an unextended active verb stem or to any theme except
the habitual. In expressing the mutable durative, on the other
hand, either of the positionals must be added to a habitual theme.
50                                 HAAS   TUNICA  In English translations it is sometimes difficult to render ade.
quately the subtle distinction between the two types of duratives,
Both may be rendered by the English present or past progressive,
For example, a sentence like “‘the man is standing” requires the
Tunica immutable durative while a sentence like “the man ig
running” requires the Tunica mutable durative. However, the
immutable durative may also be rendered by the English simple
present or past, as in “the man stands, stood,’ or by such an ex-
pression as ‘‘remains (or stays), remained (or stayed) doing . . .”
The mutable durative, on the other hand, is preferably rendered
by the present or past progressive.
     Examples of immutable duratives:
             te'tin, ho'n?ora'ni, ta’nahta ha'luht.   (4a:aw) There was a path
                  going down under the bank; ho’n?ora'ni she lay in a going
                   down position < ho’nu to go down + ?a’ra, 3rs smlf.,
                   + -a’ni, quot. postf.

                  postf.
             la'tthé, he'r?unana’ni. (9:d) At night they kept watch (or more
                    lit., remained watching); he’r?unana’ni < he’ra to watch
                    + ?u’nana, 3mMD smlf., + -a'nt     Examples of mutable duratives:
             lo’tahk?u'rana’nt.   (13:aa) They were running < lo’ta to run
                   + -hk-, habitual suff., + ?u’rana, 3Mp smlf., + -a’nt
             ta’wisthé, hi’ Staha wi'ihk?ara’ni.      (5B:e) The water was still
                   rising; we'cthk?ara’nt < wi’        to move up, rise + -hk-
                  + ?a’ra, 3Fs smlf., + -a’ni
             sa’kuhk?una’nt.   (4a‘e) he sat eating < sa’ku        to eat + -hk-
                  + ?u'na, 3ms smlf., + -a’ni
             pi'tahk?u'?una'ni. (421) He kept on walking < pz’ta to walk
                  + -hk- + ?u'?una, 3ms repet., + -a’ni. (Repetitive ex-
                  amples are rare.)   It should be noted that whether one uses ?u’ra or ?u’na in ex-
pressing the durative is largely a matter of idiom. However, it has
been possible to work out certain rules of positional classification
which govern the choice of auxiliary in a great many instances,
particularly with respect to such contrasts as that found in p2’-
tahk?ara’ni (18:b) ‘‘she was walking along” (employing 2u’ra1) as
against pi'tahk?una'ni (14a:r) “he was walking along” (employ-
ing ?u’na).       These rules are provided in section 8.3.
     4.534    The auxiliary verbs ?u’sa “he comes, came”’ (4.424) and
?u'wa “he goes, went’’ (4.425) tend to retain their literal meanings1T.e., an inflected form of ?u’ra, in this case the 3rs smlf.

stems connoting movement from one place to another and in this
usage express the notion of hitherward and thitherward direction
respectively, e.g.,

stems     and    carry the meaning        “‘he comes,    came     while   . . .-ing

  4.535         While there are no text examples of the periphrastic use
of la’ka (4.427), there is a non-text example in which its repetitive
form is used periphrastically, viz., wa’kala’laka “‘they used to
command.”      Here la’laka replaces the 3mpP repetitive form of
?u’hki (4.421 and 4.43) as is evidenced by the following form given
in the same paradigm: wa’k?0?on?iti “we used to command.”","[47, 48, 49, 50]"
"                               4.64      TRANSITIVES
   Transitives are normally inflected for pronominal object as well
as for pronominal subject. Inflection for pronominal subject is
the same as for intransitives while inflection for pronominal ob-
Ject is accomplished by the use of the alienable pronominal pre-
fixes or the reciprocal prefix (4.56). It should be noted that a
number of stems may be used as either transitives or intransitives
depending on whether they occur with or without expressed pro-
Nominal object, e.g.,
         ?uya nakate’ni.       (44:d) she spoke to him; ya'nakate'nt.          (5a%c)
              she spoke

tively unless they have been causativized (see 5.212).","[56, 57]"
"  (2) All words ending in a consonant (whether predicative words
or not) are likewise set off as pause forms only by the use of a
melody, e€.g.,
            ta'nisarahéét (16:q) the young woman, on her part
            hi’nahk?ohédt (33:d) therefore
            ha’ ratihé (3B:c) when she sang
            lo'ta wiwa'ndn. (16:h) Do you want to run?
            ya'k@thédn.   (14a:h) You must come.
In addition, many words ordinarily ending in vowels may, if it is
so desired, undergo apocope in phrase-final position. Most of such
words are those which lack a penultimate stress and end in a con-
tinuant plus 7 or in a continuant plus a voiceless stop plus 7.         In
addition, the postpositions ma’yihta “to, on the other side of”;
2a'hkihta “behind”; ha’ythta ‘‘on, upon, onto”; and ha’luhta ‘‘un-
der, beneath” are frequently apocopated in phrase-final position.
Such vocalically apocopated words are treated like other words
ending in a consonant, e.g.,
            si'nri§ (4a:az) to their home < st'nrisi
            2a'mar (21:d) enough < ?a’mari
            te'Cardhé (36a:c) the palmetto < te’€arahct
            ht’ Stahahk (22B:}) still < hi’ Stahahki
            ma’yiht (4a:bd) to the other side of, across < ma’ythta
            ha’yiht (7B:b) on < ha'ythta_ (8) With the exception of predicative words, all words ending
in k or hk plus u may be set off as pause forms by having the rising
or low phrase-final melodies placed on their penultima (1.6) with
the consequent unvoicing of the u, e.g.,
            to’mahkdku (14a:k) the alligator
            ta’yoroniku (22a:a) the Tunica
            la’hontohku (9:g) very early
This method of indicating pause forms of such words is, however,
not obligatory; they may also have pause forms built according to
the rule given immediately below.
34                               HAAS     TUNICA   (4) With the exception of predicative words, all words ending in
a vowel build their pause forms by means of an incremental -n
plus the appropriate phrase-final melody. However, non-apoco-
pated words having a stressed ultima require a special type of in-
crement (rule 5 below) before they can take the nasal increment.
The following examples illustrate words requiring the nasal in-
crement only:
             ha'tikan (4atat) again < ha’tika
             sa’hkiin (4A: ax) one < sa’hku
            ta’ éahtase’man (31:b) the Choctaw < ta’éahtase’ma
Under rule (2) it was noted that certain words are often apoco-
pated in phrase-final position; such words also occur in non-
apocopated form and in this case take the nasal increment, e.g.,
            ma'ythtan (25:a) on the other side of
Words coming under rule (8) above may also have alternative
pause forms in which the nasal increment is added, e.g.,
            ta’rustaktin (144:}) Rabbit < ta’rustaku; contrast       with   ta’-
                 rustaku (14a:j) coming under rule (3)
     (5)   Non-apocopated words having a stressed ultima and ending
in a vowel construct special pause forms characterized by an in-
cremental syllable consisting of ? plus a vowel having the identical
quality of the preceding vowel.    This incremental syllable then
takes the nasal increment and a phrase-final melody. The words
affected by this rule consist of monosyllabic stems or composite
stems ending in a monosyllabic stem.            Note the following chart:
            Context Form                            Pause Form
            rt’ house                               ridin; ri Pin
            ke’ wasp                                ke’ ?én}
            ma’ you (Ms)                            ma’ ?an
            ru’ hickory                             ru’ ?in
            la’spiri’ bank (< money-house)          la' spiri’ ?in
            2a'rupo’ dream                          2a'rupo’?6n
In one or two isolated instances (as against dozens of correct in-
stances) the monosyllabic word ma’ “you (ms)”’ occurs in phrase-
final position without an incremental syllable. In this case it takes
the nasal increment and a phrase-final melody but loses its stress.
1 As in the case of the word for “‘house,’”’ the remaining words may also take
 either the rising or the low melodies.
                CHAPTER         II:    MORPHOLOGY        3.   GENERAL       REMARKS          ON   STRUCTURE   3.1 The Tunica language is mildly synthetic in structure. In
its technique of synthesis it is for the most part agglutinative
though it also employs a limited amount of fusion. A number of
morphological processes are used: juxtaposition, affixation (pre-
fixation, infixation, and suffixation), reduplication, and suppletion.
Of these, prefixation and suffixation, particularly the latter,
are exploited to a much greater extent than are the other
processes.
   3.2. The structural elements of the word are a stem and one or
more affixes.    Stems   may   be primary    or secondary.   Secondary
stems are built up by means           of the formational techniques    of
affixation   (i.e., the addition of an affix to a primary stem)       and
juxtaposition (i.e., the placing together of two primary stems).
In either case the result is a new stem whose meaning is particu-
larized from the sum of the meanings of the component elements.
Once such a new stem has been formed, it may serve as the basis
for new formations in the same way that a primary stem does.
   Affixes are of two main types, derivational and syntactic.
Derivational affixes, as indicated above, are added to primary
stems to make secondary stems. Syntactic affixes are best sub-
divided into the inflective type and the non-inflective type. In-
flective affixes are always appended to stems while non-inflective
affixes may be appended only to formally complete words. Once
the necessary inflective affixes are appended to a stem, the result
18 @ word which is, by means of these affixes, fully defined as to its
relation to other words within a phrase or sentence. Such affixes
are employed extensively for purposes of inflection and define
person, number, gender, possession, aspect, and, in one instance,
modality.    Non-inflective affixes consist of the preverbs    and the
Dostfixes.   The former indicate direction of movement        while the
latter express a wider range of notions, including coordination,
Subordination, tense, and additional types of modality.
   3.3  The word-classes of Tunica, which have been worked out
On the basis of syntactic as well as inflectional considerations, are
as follows: the independent personal pronouns, nouns, the in-
terrogative-indefinite pronouns, quantificatives, postpositions,
36                                 HAAS   TUNICAadjectives, comparatives, adverbs, the auxiliary verbs, active
verbs, static verbs, sentence connectives, and exclamatives and
imitatives.     The   inflected classes are the independent       personal
pronouns, nouns, and the three classes of verbs.            The remaining
word-classes, which some might prefer to group together as non-
inflected particles, are distinguished here because of definitive dif-
ferences in syntactic usage (see section 10).","[32, 33, 34, 35]"
"                 4.44     THE   CONDITIONAL       PARADIGMS
   The rules for the formation of the conditional paradigms of the
auxiliary verbs are as follows:
    (1) With the exception of the 1s forms, the fusional conditional
forms are made by inserting the conditional infix -?- between the
last consonant and vowel of the corresponding semelfactive forms,
e.g.,
         wi'hk?¢ if you exist (semelfactive form w7'hki, 4.421)
         ?u'r?a if he lies (smlf. ?u’ra, 4.422)
         ?7/tan?t if we come (smlf. ?2’tani, 4.424)
         -?a'nt?a if they cause (smlf. -?a’nta, 4.426)
_ (2) The 1s fusional conditional form of ?u’wa follows the rule
just given and is accordingly ?a’n?2 “‘if I go” (smlf. ?a’n2, 4.425).
The 1s form of -?u’ta takes a special conditional infix -?a- (cf.
4.523) which is inserted before the ending -nz (always apocopated
to -n in this case) giving -hta’?an “if I cause” (smlf. -hta’ni, 4.426).
The 1s fusional conditionals for the remaining auxiliaries do not
Occur in the available material. Non-fusional forms for them may,
however, be formed according to the following rule.             .

 fix -k?2 (9.33, no. 13) to their semelfactive forms. Such alternative
 forms are used just as often as the fusional forms; hence a form
 like wi'yak?1 “if you go” (< wi'ya, 2ms smlf. of ?u’wa, + -k?4)
 occurs just as frequently as its equivalent fusional form wz’y?a.","[44, 45]"
"                          4.8       Noun   INFLECTION                         4.81       GENERAL    REMARKS
   The primary categories of the noun are the indeterminative and
the determinative. The indeterminative category consists of the
simple uninflected noun stem which may serve as either a singular
or a plural, e.g., ru’sta ‘‘a rabbit; rabbits.””          The   determinative
category, on the other hand, is marked by the use of the determin-
ing prefixes, i.e., either the articular prefix (4.82) or the pronom-
inal prefixes (denoting possession with nouns; 4.83). In addition
the determinative category is subdivided into three case cate-
gories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.! The
first of these is called the definitive because it requires the use of
the gender-number suffixes (4.841) and is the only category in
which the gender and number of a noun are explicitly defined.’
The non-definitive case makes use of no inflectional suffixes what-
soever and may be construed as either a singular or a plural de-
pending on context. The locative case is expressed by one of three
locative suffixes (4.85) and, like the non-definitive case, may be
construed as either a singular or a plural depending on context.
1 The syntactic functions of these cases are described in section 10.11.

  tion 8.1.
              HANDBOOK      OF   AMERICAN          INDIAN    LANGUAGES                  63                         4.82    THE     ARTICULAR        PREFIX  4.821       The articular prefix, which is used as a determining pre-
fix, usually has the force of a definite article but in some contexts
it is equivalent to English            “‘some.”’    It regularly appears in the
form ta’- before all stems except those beginning in ? or in é. Be-
fore stems beginning in ? it appears in the form ¢- with the conse-
quent syncopation of the ? (see 2.255). Before stems beginning in
t it is usually haplologically omitted (2.26) though it may some-
times be analogically restored. Examples:
          ta’ Cohdku (21:e) the chief < ta’- + éo’ha chief + -ku, ms suff.
          ta’nakase’mdn (20:f) the warriors, or (in another instance in the
               same paragraph) some warriors < fa’- + na’ka warrior
               + -se’ma, MP suff.
          lotmahkaku       (144:f)     the   alligator < t- + ?0’mahka        alligator
                 + -ku
          ta’ lahé (tay)     some     cane < é- + ?a’la reed,       cane + -hé(2),      FS
                 suff.
          te’ti ha’ythta (33:a) on the road; te’tz the road < te’tz road; note
                the absence of the art. pref.
          ta’torahkiku (5B:a) the ice < ta’- + to’rahki ice + -ku; the form
                 to’rahkiku could also be used here
Some noun stems undergo a change in form when preceded by the
articular prefix, e.g., ta’rkuku “‘the tree” (< ta’- + ri’hku “‘tree”’
+ -ku).   This is discussed in 2.244 and 2.251.
    4,822 Proper nouns, with the exception of those whose stems
begin in ¢, cannot be used without the articular prefix. Those
whose stems begin in ¢ omit the prefix for the reason given above
but they nevertheless configurate as determinatives.       Proper
nouns include place names and names of mythical characters,
e.g.,
          ta’wist?e the Mississippi < fa’- + wi’ §(2)t?e big water
          ta’wismi'li Red River < ta’- + wi’ §(t)mi’li red water
          ta'lunti'tthki Bayou des Glaise < ta’- + (ha’)lunti’tihki                 field-
                 bayou
          ti’niko’wi the Clawed Witch (no known etymology)
          ta’ Slina the Stone Witch (no known etymology)
Names of animals are also used as proper nouns when the animals
occur as characters in myths or tales, e.g., ta’rusiaku (14a:b)
“Rabbit” < ta’- + ru’Sta “rabbit” + -ku.
_ 4.823 There are a very few inherently determinative nouns,
1e., nouns which are used in the determinative category without
taking a determining prefix. Two of these are derived from the
Static verb      stem -ha’yi ‘“‘to be old’          (4.71)   and   are respectively
?uha’yi   “the     old   man”        (<“he    is old’’)      and   tiha’yz   “the     old
woman” (< “‘she is old’’). A third is ?uha'yimi’&tihki “the oldest,
older one” (< ?uha'yt + mi’Stthki “more’’).
64                                  HAAS    TUNICA     There are three proper nouns referring to ‘‘the Lord” which arg
also inherently determinative.                  The first of these is ?uha’yi (aj.
ready mentioned) which has the meaning “the Old Man,” ie.
“the Lord.’’ A more common term, however, is ?uha’yi&i “the One
Above”’ (possibly < ?uhk-, 3ms pref., + ha’yii “above,” ang
hence probably more or less equivalent to “His Aboveness’’). Ag
the third term, we have ha’yist which is probably a simplifieq
form of ?uha’yisi.
   In a few instances postpositions (5.61) are used as nouns and
these, too, are inherently determinative, e.g.,
            ?a/hkisiku (9:p) the one in the rear < ?a’hkisi back of, in the
                 rear of + -ku, ms suff.
            ?a'hkihtaku (9:0) the one             in   the    rear,    or,    the    one   behind
                  < ?a’'hkthta behind + -ku
            te’risiku (4a:bf) the first one, or, the one in front < é’ri& in
                  front of + -ku     4.83   THE   USE   OF    THE   PRONOMINAL               PREFIXES         WITH     NOUNS   When used with nouns the pronominal prefixes (4.21) configur-
ate as determining prefixes and, as such, exclude the occurrence
of the articular prefix with the same stem. They may be attached
to any noun stem to denote its possessor.                       There are, however, a
special group of stems, known as inalienably possessed noun
stems, which cannot be used without a pronominal prefix. Stems
of this type include:
   (1) kinship terms, e.g., -e’st “father”; '-gaci “‘mother’’; ’-ki
“maternal uncle’’; -a’haya “‘sibling of the opposite sex”; -a’néayt
“wife”; -Sa’yz “husband.”
   (2) body-part terms, e.g., -e’sint “head”; -e’neri “horns”;
-e’ruhki “neck”;        ’-lu “tongue”;           -e’yu “arm”;               -a’htart “wing”;
‘-hkeni “‘hand”’; -a’ska ‘“foot’’; -a’stayi “body.”
     (3) the miscellaneous terms -e’htiwa’hkunt “breechcloth” ; -e’hi-
Zura “‘clothing’’; -e’tisa ‘“‘name.”’
   Inalienably possessed nouns take the inalienable prefixes while
all other nouns take the alienable prefixes. Examples of inalien-
ably possessed nouns are:
            2e'stku (29) my father < 4- + -e’st + -ku, Ms suff.
            ?o'hoyahé (7a:c) his sister < ?u- + -a’haya + -hé(2), Fs suff.
            20’sin ha’ytht (13:h) over his head; ?0’sin(z) < ?u- + -e’sine
Examples of alienably possessed nouns are:
            2thk?o'nise’man    (25:b)      my     people < %hk-,             1s pref., + %0'nt
                 person + -se’ma, MP suff.
            ti’sast'nimdn (4B:ap) her dogs < tthk-,                   3rs    pref., + sa’     dog
                 -+- -st/nima, FD-P suff.

definitive case of the determinative category (4.81). This means
that whenever a noun stem is used with one of these suffixes it
will also take a determining prefix (4.82 and 4.83).
    The paradigm of the gender-number suffixes is as follows:
              Sg.                      Du.                   Du. and PI.                   Pl.
M       -ku, -ku’hu              -?u'nima                                           -se’ma, -sem
F       -héi, -hév’he                                        -st’nima, -sinThe same feminine form (-sz’nima or -sin) is used both as a dual
and as a plural. Note also that the dual and plural suffixes are
related to the independent personal pronouns ?u’nema (3MD),
si’nima (never *sin; 38FD-P), and se’ma (never *sem; 3MP), respec-
tively (see 4.221). The function of the suffixes is, however, quite
distinct from that of the pronouns.
   The alternative forms -sin (for -si’nima, FD-P) and -sem (for
-se’ma, MP) are irregularly apocopated atonic forms. The alterna-
tive forms -ku‘hu (for -ku, Ms) and -hét’hi (for -hct, FS), on the other
hand, seem to have a special implication (see 4.842).
   Examples of these suffixes (exclusive of the forms -ku’hu and
-héa’ht) are as follows:
            ta’Cohdku (58:c) the chief < ta’- + ha                       + -ku
            aria?             Afacb)         the    girl < ta’- + ni’sara        young     person
                    + -hé(a
            tithk?o’katohk?u’nimdan            (4B:ab)       her children < tthk-, 3¥s pref.,
                   + ?9’kato’hku + -2u'nima            ,
            te’ sasi/nimdn (4B: ap) her dogs < tihk- + sa’ + -si’nima
            ta’yorum?ahasin (4A: ar) the beasts < ta’- + yo’rum?aha + -sin
            to’nisise’mdn (35a:b) the men < ta’- + ?0’nisi’ + -se’ma
            wihk?o'nisém (224:j) your people < wthk-, 2ms pref., + ?0’nz
                 -+ -sEm   4.842 The alternative singular forms -ku’hu (m) and -hé’hi
(F) are used very rarely in the texts, but on the basis of what few
examples there are, it seems likely that they carry the implication
of selectivity. Hence, to’niku’hu may mean “‘it is the man who” as
Opposed to to’niku which means simply “the man.’”’ Examples:
            2y'kiku'hin, 2iha’l?uhkt. (4a!ad) my uncle has sent me, or bet-
                 ter, it is my uncle who has sent me
            to’gacthce'hin,     ?asa’'nt.          (13:ak)     it was   her mother       who     was
                    coming    4.843     In addition to their use with nouns we find that any of
the gender-number suffixes may be added to an inflected verb form
to convert it into a relative clause.                    In some cases the noun is fol-
66                                  HAAS      TUNICAlowed by the appropriate gender-suffix and in addition the verb of
the relative clause is followed by the same suffix, e.g.,
             to'nise'man, ta’herit?e ki’ Cin, 2u'k?erase’man (5a:d) the people
                  who were in the boat; to’ntse’ma the people < t- + ?0’nj
                  -++ -se’ma; ?u'k?erase’ma who were sitting < ?u’k?era they
                  were sitting + -se’ma
In other cases, however, only the verb of the relative clause takes
a gender-number suffix, such suffix being omitted from the noun,
e.g.,
             to'nt hi'p?ontase’man (5B:e) the people who had been dancing;
                   hi'p?ontase’ma who had been dancing < hz’p?onta they
                   had been dancing + -se’ma
Since the less than two dozen examples of this usage are about
evenly divided between the two procedures, it is not possible to
determine which is correct.","[61, 62, 63, 64, 65]"

APPENDIX: SAMPLE TEXT WITH GRAMMATICAL ANALYSIS..                  135
   The Tunica } were always a comparatively small tribe of Indians
but today their numbers are reduced to a mere handful living near
Marksville, Louisiana. Of these there is only one individual, Sesos-
trie Youchigant (born c. 1870), who speaks the language with any
degree of fluency. He also speaks Louisiana French and English,
the former more readily than the latter.                      While there are a few
other Indians who know some isolated words and phrases of Tu-
nica, none of them is familiar enough with the language to con-
verse with Youchigant. In fact Youchigant has had no occasion
to converse in Tunica since the death of his mother in 1915, and,
even before her death, he preferred to speak French to her al-
though she always spoke Tunica to him.
   Tunica was probably in a more or less decadent state even two
or three generations ago. The reasons for this are obvious. Near
the end of the nineteenth century the Indian village near Marks-
ville was inhabited by remnants of at least three rapidly dying
tribes: Tunica, Ofo,? and Avoyelles.? To add to the linguistic con-
fusion there were Biloxi? and Choctaw Indians living nearby and
the various groups frequently danced and played ball together.
Since the language of each of these tribes (except the Choctaw)
was known to only a few individuals, intertribal communication
was possible only through the medium of the Mobilian jargon °
1 For a presentation of what is known of the history and ethnology of the Tunica,
 see John R. Swanton, Indian Tribes of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Adja-
 cent Coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Bulletin, Bureau of American Ethnology, 43,
 1911), pp. 306-337.                     .
   Swanton has also published a sketch of the Tunica language (see The Tunica
 Language,   International   Journal of American          Linguistics,      vol. 2, pp.       1-39),
 based on the notes of Albert 8. Gatschet and some additional notes of his own.
 Gatschet’s notes were recorded in 1886 and contain many of the phonetic inac-
 curacies commonly made at that time. His material is particularly weak in that
 he failed to record glottal stops.   Hence a better understanding of the phonetics
 of the language coupled with the great amount of new grammatical and text
 material obtained from Youchigant has contributed much toward making pos-
 sible a fuller and more adequate analysis of the language.

 Ofo Languages (Bulletin, Bureau of American Ethnology, 47, 1912), p. 12.

   That Tunica has been remembered somewhat longer than the
other languages of the vicinity is a matter of accident. At present
it serves no sociological function whatsoever and when a language
has reached that stage it is to all intents and purposes a dead lan-
guage. Hence it is to be assumed that what Youchigant recalls of
Tunica is at best a mere remnant of what the language must have
been when many speakers used it as their only means of communi-
cation. Indeed, I often had the feeling that the Tunica grooves in
Youchigant’s memory might be compared to the grooves in a
phonograph record; for he could repeat what he had heard but
was unable to make up new expressions of his own accord. He
himself is keenly aware of his deficiencies and often expressed his
regret that he so seldom heeded his mother when she reprimanded
him for speaking French instead of Tunica. He is also conscious
of the fact that his polylingualism interferes with his ability to re-
call Tunica.
   Youchigant’s comments with respect to the speech of the “‘old
people’ deserve some attention.                He himself always spoke very
rapidly as if he might be in danger of forgetting the words if he did
not utter them as fast as possible. But in contrast to his own man-
ner of speaking he says that ‘“‘the old people sitting around the fire
telling stories always talked slow, slow.’’ In addition he often
commented on the fact that the old people “‘spoke more plain.”
   In spite of the obvious deficiencies in Youchigant’s command of
the language, I think it is safe to say that I obtained as much lin-
guistic information from him as it is possible to obtain. While it
cannot be denied that there are certain lacunae in this material,
most of these are to be interpreted as lacunae in his knowledge of
the language. Although the grammatical analysis of a dying lan-
guage presents for this reason many problems and difficulties, I
have made every attempt to present the grammar of Tunica in the
same way that I would present that of a living language.
   Most of the illustrative material quoted in the chapters on
morphology and syntax is taken from my book Tunica Tezts.? The
source is given in parentheses immediately after the Tunica exam-
ple.   The text number reference is separated from the paragraph
letter reference   by means        of a colon, e.g., 44:c,                which is to be1QOr, to put it in his own words: “It’s not good you learn too much language
 [= too many languages].   It broke your language. You can’t speak plain.”

tion entitled A Grammar of the Tunica Language, which was pre-
sented to the faculty of the Graduate School of Yale University in
candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1935. The
field work which served as the basis for the dissertation was fi-
nanced by the Committee on Research in American Native Lan-
guages. After the preparation of the dissertation the work on
Tunica was temporarily laid aside until the summer of 1938 when
the Committee furnished me a special appropriation for the prep-
aration of Tunica Texts. After the texts were prepared the de-
sirability of enlarging and revising the original draft of the gram-
mar became apparent and in the summer of 1939 the Committee
furnished me another grant for the purpose of accomplishing this
task.       My sincerest thanks are due to all of the members of the
Committee and particularly to Professor Franz Boas for his un-
failing encouragement and inspiration.

phonetic group of Tunica is the phrase, which may contain a single
word or several words. Phrases are always set off from other
phrases by pauses and are also characterized by special intona-
tional or melodic features. On the other hand, words occurring
within the same phrase form a unit. They are not set off from
each other by pauses nor by any other special characteristics of a
phonetic nature.
   Every phrase, every word, and every syllable must begin in a
single consonant but may end in a vowel, a consonant, or a cluster
of two consonants. Hence vowels are never clustered and clusters
of more than three consonants do not occur. A phrase or a word
may have one or more stressed syllables but these are never con-
secutive.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"
"  8.33   In the above examples it is shown how the assumed or
characteristic position of a noun determines the type of positional
verb to be used with it. Certain other special situations also reflect
the positional classification of nouns.
   In the first place we find that there are three active verb stems
in Tunica meaning ‘‘to place, put . . .”’ and the choice of stem
to be used depends on the assumed or characteristic position of the
noun which functions as the objective referee. These stems are as
follows:
   (1) ra’wu “to lay . . .; to place, put . . . in a horizontal posi-
tion,” e.g., ta’ydku, ta’haltan, ?ura'w?oke’ni.                (4a:d) “She put the
deer on the ground.”
   (2) ?u’ki..c. “to set . . .; to place, put... in a squatting
position,” e.g., ta’kuwato’hoku, ta’haltan, ?uhk?u’kin?uhki. ‘He
put the bird on the ground.”
  (3) ka’lz..c. “to stand            .. .; to place, put ...             in a vertical
position,” e.g., to’Skaée’hkinik ?uhka’lin?uhke’ni, ta’yi ha’yiht.
(7a:e) ‘He placed the kettle on the fire.”
   8.34   There are also two expressions having the specialized
112                                  HAAS    TUNICAmeaning “‘to stop, come to rest,’’ one of which refers to a horizon.
tal position, the other to a vertical position, viz.,
      (1) ha-..na’ (see 9.21, no. 4) referring to the horizontal posj-
tion, e.g.,
              ta’herit?esa'huhé, hana'?ake'nt. (22B:c) The other boat stopped.
              ta’nakahé, hana’tthé (22a:m) when the war was over < when
                   the war stopped !
      (2)   ha-. .ka’li (see 9.21, no. 4) referring to the vertical position,
e.g.,
              tiya'nawthé, haka'l?eke'ni.    (4B:bm) When he spoke to her, she
                    stopped (i.e., in standing position).
              ta’lahé, yu'kaka'l?eke'ni      (4a:bj) the arrow got there and
                    stopped (i.e., in vertical position); yu’kaka’l?eke'nt, amal-
                   gamated      < yu'kahaka’l?cke'ni.
   8.35 In the discussion devoted to the formation of active verb
duratives (4.533) it was pointed out that either of the two posi-
tional auxiliaries (?u’ra “‘he lies” or ?u’na “‘he sits’’) could be used.
Although the choice of auxiliary is in certain cases apparently
arbitrary, it is found to depend in large part on a combination of
the features of gender and position. The following rules apply in
too many cases to be considered a matter of accident:
   (1) In the case of a single male animate subject whose position
is free, the auxiliary ?w’na is used if an erect or sitting position is
implied in connection with the activity involved, whereas the
auxiliary ?u’ra is used if a lying position is implied in connection
with the activity involved. Examples:
              pi'tahk?una'nt      (4a:b) he (a man) was walking along
              ta’ st?éku, we' sahk?una’ni.   (13:1) The horse was jumping.
              pa’ kan?una'ni.     (4B:d) He (a man) replied.   (From the context
                   we know the man is in a sitting position; contrast with the
                   next example.)
              pa'kan?ura'ni. (4B:e) He replied. (From the context we know
                   that the man is in a lying position.)
   (2) In the case of a single female animate subject whose posi-
tion is free, the auxiliary ?u’ra is used if an erect or lying position
is implied in connection with the activity involved, whereas the
auxiliary ?u’na is used if a sitting position is implied in connection
with the activity involved.       Contrast with the preceding rule.
Examples:
        pi'tahk?ara'nt. (18:b) She (an opossum) was walking along.
             (Contrast with pi’tahk?una’ni, above.) (?a’ra is the 3F8
             of ?u’ra)
              ta’ Slina wa' G&hk?ard. (44:1) The Stone Witch is fighting.
              to'ninu'hethé, ha'rahk?ace'nt, ta’rihkuya’hona'yiht.    (33:a) The
                     woman sat singing on the limb. (?a’&% is the 3rs of ?u'na)
1 The word na’ka “‘war’’ is an abstract noun (see 8.32).
            HANDBOOK         OF   AMERICAN     INDIAN    LANGUAGES           113  (3)   If the characteristic position of a single male or female ani-
mate subject is horizontal, the auxiliary ?u’ra is used, but if the
characteristic     pc ition is squatting,       the auxiliary     ?u’na is used.
Examples:
          to'mahkdku, hi’puhk@ura’nt.        (14a:k)    The alligator was danc-
               ing
          hi'kidiin, ha'rahk?ace'nd.      (18:a) She (@ wren) was singing in
                 there.
   (4) In the case          of a single inanimate       subject   the auxiliary
?u’ra is used, e.g.,
          ta’ythé, 2e’mahk?ara'ni. (44:m) The fire was burning.
          ta’wisihé, wi’ cthk?ara'ni. (5B:e) The water was rising.
    (5) In the case of dual male animate subjects whose position is
free, the auxiliary ?u’na is used if an erect or sitting position is im-
plied in connection with the activity involved, e.g.,
          pt'tahk?u’nana’ni.       (10:e) They (two boys) were walking along.
          lo'tahk?u'nana'ni.       (19:h) They (a man and a dog) were run-
                 ning along.
   (6) In the case of dual female animate subjects or of dual male
and female animate subjects whose position is free, the auxiliary
?u’ra is used if an erect or lying position is implied in connection
with the activity involved.      Contrast with the preceding rule.
Examples:
          ta’hka to’musi'rana'ni.      (4B: au) They (two girls) were pounding
                 corn.
          lo’tahk?u'rana’ni.       (13:aa) They    (a man and a woman)       were
                 running.      (Contrast with lo’tahk?u’nana’ni, quoted above)
   (7) In the case of all types of plural animate subjects, the
auxiliary ?u’ra is used if an erect or lying position is implied in
connection with the activity involved, whereas the auxiliary ?u’na
is used if a sitting position is implied in connection with the activ-
ity involved, o.g.,
          pi'tana’?arahé (9:p) as they (three men) were walking
          to’nisém, hi'puna’?ara’nt. (144:0) The people (men and women)
                 were dancing.
          ta'nisarast'nima yu'kina’?ara'ni.        (13:v) The girls were cooking.
          ta’ satost’/nimdn, &t'mina’?ard.     (7B:b) Some puppies are playing.
          ta'herita’losa lo’sahk?u'k?era’nt.      (224:e) They (men) were pull-
                 ing the oars.
          to’nise’mdn, ?uhpo'hk?uk?era'ni.         (4B:a) The people (men and
                 women)     were looking at him.
   While these rules do not cover all possible types of situations,
they are based on those which are illustrated in the available mate-
rial. There are a few exceptions to these rules which at present
cannot be explained. In particular we find that the paradigmatic
114                                       HAAS    TUNICAforms     of     the        combination      ka’li    “to   stand’?    +    ?u’ra     “the   lies”
> ka'l?ura are used with both male and female animate subjects
whereas a theoretically possible combination ka’li + ?u’na “he
sits’ is never used.!","[110, 111, 112, 113]"
"                         4.85     THE    LOCATIVE      SUFFIXES     4.851    There are three locative suffixes used in the formation
of the locative case (4.81). All nouns in this case also take a de-
termining prefix (4.82 and 4.83). The gender-number suffixes and
the locative suffixes are mutually exclusive but the number of a
noun in the locative case may be singular or plural depending on
context. In addition to their use with nouns the locative suffixes
are widely used in forming postpositions and adverbs from post-
positional stems         (5.61 and 5.62) and in forming demonstrative
adverbs from demonstrative stems (5.7).
  4.852 The most widely used locative suffix is -32 (generally
apocopated to -S; see 2.822). This suffix is used as a general locati-
vizer having the meaning                ‘‘at, to.”    From    the English point of
view it is occasionally best rendered by “‘in, into” or “‘on, over.”
In the Tunica idiom, however, the meaning remains “at, to” and
it is not possible to substitute the postpositions kz’éu “in, into”’ or
ha'yihta ‘“‘on, onto, over” for the suffix in such cases. Examples:
             2u'rts   2una'ni.    (7B:d)     He    stayed   at home   < at   his   house;
                  ?u'ris(t) < ?uhk-, 3ms pref.,         + ri’ house + -s¢
             ha'tikdn, ma'r?ota'nt, ta'yanerds.         (7B:j) she went back to the
                   ocean; ta’yaneras(t) < ta’- + ya’nera ocean + -si
             ?u’ Stahpus Cu’h?uhke'ni. (9:f) he spat in his face < at his face;
                   ?u’' Stahpus(t) < ?u-, 3Ms pref., + ’-Stahpu face + -s
             ta’luntt’ tthki§ ?u'?una'ni. (non-text) He used to live on Bayou
                   des Glaise; ta’lunti’tihkis(t) < ta’lunti'tihki Bayou des
                   Glaise + -&
             lo’hkatéhku, te'yus ku'n?ara'ni.         (9:1) She had a basket hooked
                  over her arm;     te’yus(t)     < ti-, 3Fs8 pref., + -e’yu arm + -82
An additional use of -§2 is discussed in 4.855.
          HANDBOOK          OF     AMERICAN          INDIAN   LANGUAGES                  67   4.853   The second of the locative suffixes is -Stihki (prob. < -8&
‘at, to”? + a bound element -tzhki) meaning ‘‘toward, in the direc-
tion of.”” It is rarely used except with the names of the directions,
e.£>
        ta’sap?arastihk          (22B:c)     to    the   west < ta’-+ sa’p?ara         west
             + -stihki
   4,854 The last of the locative suffixes is -hta ‘‘on, onto.”                        It is
rarely used except with ta’halz ‘‘the ground,” e.g.,
        ta’haltan, éu’h?uhke'ni. (4a:az) he spat on the ground;                     ta’halta
              < ta’- + ha’l(t) ground, land + -hta
In the available material it also occurs in one other expression,
ViZ.,
        st'luhtdn, siya’nakant.            (22a:h) I am speaking to them in their
             (own) language;           sz’luhta < si-, 3mp         pref., + ’-lu tongue;
             language + -Ata
   4.855   In addition to its use with nouns -s2 is sometimes at-
tached to an inflected verb form in order to convert it into a loca-
tive clause. There are no instances in which the other locative
suffixes are used in a similar manner.                   Examples:
        ta’ttht?&n, 2u'ras, ya'k?undhé (13:ak) when they came to a
              river < a river to (where) it lay; ?u’ras(i) < ?u’ra he lay
             + -%
        ma’r?uwa'ni, ?uha'yik ?u'nds.   (14a:v) He returned to (the
             place where) the Old Man was < to (where) the Old Man
               sat, lived; ?u’nas(z) < ?u’na he sat, lived + -s%
        ta’ St?zku, ka’l?uras yu'kawihé (13: h) when he came up to the
             horse < to (where)              the    horse stood;     ka’l?uras(t)   < ka’l-
             2ura he stood + -s2
It should be noted that locative clauses built up with -&7 are freely
Interchangeable with “where’’ clauses employing the interrog-
ative-indefinite adverb ka’ta (7.46) in place of -%, e.g.,
        ka’tan, ta’tiht?&n, ?u'rdhé (22c:c) where a river lay.                  (Contrast
              with the first example above.)                       5.    STEM           FORMATION
                 5.1        FoRMATIONAL              TECHNIQUES
   The formational techniques employed in building secondary
stems are prefixation, suffixation, juxtaposition, and implicit
Process. Of these the process of juxtaposition is used far more
Widely than are the other processes. Suffixation is next in impor-
tance and after that implicit process. Prefixation is used so rarely
that we find it occurring only in the formation of agentive noun
Stems and in the formation of a few adverbs.
68                                        HAAS   TUNICA                              5.2    Active      VERB     STEMS
                          5.21      THE     THEMATIC      SUFFIXES   5.211  The thematic suffixes may be added to an active verb
stem to form an extended stem or a theme. These suffixes fall into
two classes, the restricted and the non-restricted.    When the
former type is used the resultant theme may be inflected only
periphrastically, but when the latter type is employed the result-
ant theme may be inflected in all of the ways in which a non-causa-
tive active verb stem may be inflected (4.52 and 4.53).
   5.212 The use of the causative suffix -n in the inflection of
causative active verb stems has already been discussed (4.543)
and it will be noted in that discussion that this suffix is restricted.
In addition to its use in inflected forms we find that its variant
-ni} is used in causative infinitives (e.g., ?u’runt “‘to whoop’’)
and in agentive noun stems derived from causative stems (e.g.,
ta’harani “‘fiddle’”’; see 5.44).2. There are a number of inherently
causative active verb stems in Tunica but in addition the process
of causativization may be used in forming transitives from in-
transitives and in forming either intransitives or transitives from
impersonals or transimpersonals.*                  Examples:
         Causativized Stems                                      Basic Stems
wo'ru. .c. tr. to show, teach...                         wo’ru intr. to learn
pihu..c. tr. to hide...                                  pi’hu intr. to hide oneself
le’. .c. tr. tolose ...                                  le’ intr. to disappear
ka’li. .c. tr. to place, put, stand                     ka’li intr. to stand
      ...;)    tocreate     ...
ha’ra..c.      tr. to    play...          (an           ha’ra intr. to sing
     instrument)
wt’..c.     intr.   to    listen;   tr.    to           wt’ imp. to sound
     hear...
hi'yu..c.      tr. to wake ... up                       hi’yu trsimp. to awaken
pi'ra..c.      intr. to turn oneself                    pi'ra imp. to turn, get to be;
     into; tr. to turn       . . . into                      trsimp.   to turn into, be-
                                                             come
In addition to the types of causativization illustrated above we
find that any non-causative intransitive stem may be causativized
and thus become a transitive stem having the meaning ‘‘to cause
...to...,” eg., lo’ta..c. “to cause... to run” < lo’ta “to
run.”
 1 The form -n rather than -n7 is set up for inflected forms because of the fact that
   following vowels undergo no assimilation, e.g., ?u’run?a’ki “she whooped.”
? By entering into such forms as these the causative suffix differs from all other
   thematic suffixes for they must be followed by inflectional elements.
* The abbreviations used in this list are as follows: c., causative; intr., intransi-
   tive; tr., transitive; imp., impersonal; trsimp., transimpersonal.
            HANDBOOK         OF    AMERICAN           INDIAN     LANGUAGES           69   5.213    The     habitual      thematic     suffix -hk-'! is restricted.        It is
used only to form a habitual theme of an active verb stem when it
is desired to express the habitual aspect in periphrastic inflection
(4.531; 4.542, rule 2; 4.544, rule 2). Although the causative suffix
and the habitual suffix are mutually exclusive, a causative stem
may form a habitual theme in the same way as a non-causative
stem but in this event the causative nature of the verb is indicated
by the use of the causative auxiliary (4.542, rule 2; 4.544, rule 2).
Examples of the habitual suffix:
           hi'puhk?ura’ni. (14B:h) he was dancing; based on hi’puhk-
                < hi'pu to dance -+ -hk-
           pa'kahk?uta'ni.  (4a:d) he was replying; based on pa‘kahk-
                < pa’ka..c. to reply + -hk-   5.214 The thematic suffix -tahk- ‘constantly, always, all the
time”’ is restricted in use not only to verbs undergoing periphrastic
inflection but is further restricted in that the auxiliary used in
periphrasis must be in the repetitive aspect (4.43), e.g.,
           2ame'katahk?u'?unana’ni. (11B:a) They were constantly quar-
               reling; based on me’kaiahk- < me’ka to quarrel with
                  + -tahk-
           Pus’ hkantahk?u'?uhke'nt. (24:a) they have always helped
                them; based on S&’hkantahk- < si’hka..c. to help + -n,
                  caus. suff., + -tahk-  5.215     The thematic suffix -hapa- “already” is non-restricted.
It is undoubtedly related to the active verb stem ha’pa “‘to stop,
quit, cease, finish’? but must be classed as a suffix (1) because it
is atonic and (2) because it loses the h and undergoes contraction
with the preceding vowel when attached to non-monosyllabic
stems (see 2.222). The difference between the two elements is
nevertheless largely formal and the suffix may often be translated
more literally by means of the expressions ‘‘having stopped, quit,
ceased, finished.’’ Examples:
           na‘hap?ake'nt.  (4B:e) she had already gone to bed < lain
                down; based on na’hapa- < na’ to lie down + -hapa-
           2a'mep?ake'ni. (4B: as) she had already gone; based on ?a’mepa-
                < ?a'mi to go + -hapa-
           sa’map?u'tahé (11B:d) when he had finished cooking; based on
               sa’mapa- < sa’ma. .c. to cook + -hapa-
  5.216     The      thematic      suffix    -hila-     “being    about   to,   almost,
nearly”’ is likewise non-restricted.            It is possibly related to the ac-1 The probable connection of the habitual suffix -hk- with the element -hk- and
  suppletive forms -ka- and -k- used in the habitual paradigm of non-causative
  verbs is discussed in 4.522.

reasons as those given for -hapa- above.           Examples:             la’hilatthé (4a:b) when it was nearly night < when (the sun)
                   was about to set; based on la’hila- < la’ (the sun) to set
                   + -hila-

                 ta'pila- < ta’pi to catch, take hold of + -hila-   5.217 The thematic suffix -po- is non-restricted but it is used
so rarely that it has not been possible to assign a clearcut meaning
to it. Tentatively, a meaning ‘“‘to try to . . ., tried . . .-ing’’ has
been assumed for it. It may be related to the active verb stem po’
“to look, see’”’ but differs from it formally in being atonic. Exam-
ples:
             si'nken ta’pipoko'ni. (13:y) he tried taking hold of their hands;
                  ta'pipoko'ni based on ta’pipo- < ta’pi to take hold of

                  na’ Sipo- < na’ st to lead, take along + -po-     5.218    In only two cases has it been possible to find instances
wherein more than one thematic suffix is attached to the same
stem. In both cases the causative suffix -n (5.212) is involved as
the prior element. It is followed once by -tahk- (5.214) and once
by -hapa- (5.215):
             ?usi'hkantahk?u'?uhke'nt. (24:a) they have always helped
                  them; based on &’hkantahk- < Si’hka..c. to help + -n
                  + -tahk-
             2u'runap?a’hkint. (non-text) I have already whooped; based on
                  ?u'runap- < ?u’ru..c. to whoop + -n + -hapa-  5.219 It has been mentioned that -hapa- “already” (5.215) is
probably related to the active verb stem ha’pa “‘to stop, quit,
cease, finish,” that -hila- “being about to, almost, nearly” (5.216)
is possibly related to hz’la ‘‘to move,” and that -po- “to try to...,
tried . . .-ing’”’ (5.217) may be related to po’ ‘‘to look, see.’’ In
section 5.23 it is shown that two or more active verb stems may
be linked together, sometimes resulting in a specialization of mean-
ing and sometimes not. In all probability it is through this process
of linking that the stems ha’pa, hi’la, and po’ have been worn
down to atonic suffixes with specialized meaning (5.231). It is, how-
ever, impossible to postulate a similar origin for the remaining
thematic suffixes. Here again, then, we have a distinction between
the restricted and the non-restricted suffixes, for it is only in the
case of the latter that we find a relationship to active verb stems.
           HANDBOOK           OF    AMERICAN    INDIAN     LANGUAGES           71                       5.22        THE   PURPOSIVE      SUFFIX  The purposive suffix -wan “‘in order to . . .”’ is added to non-
causative or causative infinitives (4.51 and 4.541). The resultant
form may be inflected for pronominal object (4.56) but not for
pronominal subject, e.g.,
          2u'kiwan ya'k?ahkint.           (12:e) I have come to stay; ?u/kiwan
                < ?u’ki to sit, dwell, stay + -wan
          na'rawan ?a'm ?uwana'ni. (15:f) he wanted to leave in order
               to fly; na’rawan < na’ra to fly + -wan
          mu’ éusina’ni, ?uhta’piwan. (4a:ay) they were diving in order
               to catch him; ?uhta’piwan < ?uhk-, 3ms pref., + ta’pi to
               catch + -wanAs is illustrated in the above examples a purposive form may be
freely used as the complement of any verb. In addition it is often
used as the complement of an active verb form built on the stem
ya’ “to do, make, commit” giving a somewhat idiomatic construc-
tion having the meaning ‘‘to try to, intend to; start to” (< the
literal meaning ‘‘to do in order to’), e.g.,
         ta’ st?ekiin, ?uhke’héawan yako'ni.         (13:h) the horse was trying
                to bite him; ?uhke'hédawan           < ?uhk- + ke’héa to bite
                 + -wan
          ra’puwan ya'wthé (42F) when he intended to sleep; ra’puwan
                < ra’pu to sleep + -wan
          lo'tawan ya'tthé (9:}) when she starts to run; lo/tawan < lo’ta
                 to run + -wan               5.23   THE     LINKING     OF   ACTIVE    VERB    STEMS   5.231  Two or more active verb stems having the same logical
subject are often linked together, the subjective inflection being
provided in connection with the last stem only. In all cases this
linkage constitutes a copulative construction ! comparable to the
copulative noun stem plus noun stem composites discussed in 5.433.
   The events expressed by the different stems may be simultane-
ous or consecutive. If simultaneous, the stems may occur in any
order, e.g.,
          ha’raht' putthé (38: d) when she sang and danced; based on ha'ra
                to sing + hi’pu to dance
          tira’pape’k?uhke’nt. (9:1) He hit her and killed her; based on
                 ra’pa to kill     + pe’ka to hit; note that since the events are
                 simultaneous it is not necessary to place pe’ka first
          kipa'tamu’ €?uhke'nt.   (16:1) he dived and fell in; based on
               pa'ta to fall + mu’éu to dive; contrast with kimu’'éupa’-
               tawe’nt (16:m) wherein the order of the stems is reversed.","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70]"
"   5.92 The numerals from one to eight inclusive are unanalyza-
ble beyond the fact that many of them appear to contain a special
suffix *-hku, viz., sa’hku, ?e’nihku, ma’nku, si’nku, ta’yihku, and
ti’sthku. Although the similarity between Tunica si’nku and Mex-
ican Spanish       cinco is striking,         it is not certain that the Tunica
term is a borrowing,         particularly since the latter is one of the
numerals      which appear to contain a suffix *-hku.                  The term to’h-
kusa’'hku     ‘nine’     seems    to     be     < *to’hku-,      meaning     unknown,
 + sa’hku “one” and may originally have had some such meaning
as “one ‘lacking.”’
   The stems mi’cu “ten,” po’lun “hundred,” po'lunt?e ‘“thou-
sand,” and the composite po’lunt?e tiha’yi ‘‘million’”’ must be fol-
            HANDBOOK          OF    AMERICAN      INDIAN    LANGUAGES                    85lowed by another numeral defining the number of tens, hundreds,
thousands, or millions involved.
  The ’teens are based on mz’éu sa’hku ‘‘one ten’ to which is added
an element -teya, presumably having some such meaning as
“plus.” This gives us mi’éu sa’hteya which must in its turn be
followed by another numeral defining the number of digits added.
Terms for “twenty plus .. .,” “thirty plus . . .,” and so on, are
formed in a similar manner, and these must also be followed by an-
other numeral defining the number of digits added, e.g., m2’éu
94/liteya sa'hku “twenty-one”; mi’&u 2e’nihteya sa’hku “‘thirty-one.”’
   5.93 The stem po’lun “hundred” is also used as a general
term for “measure”? and hence may also be interpreted ‘‘mile,
acre, etc.”’ in the appropriate context, e.g., po’lun ta’yihkin, ka’-
nako’nt. (13:aa) “He would step seven miles.”’ The term po’-
lunt?e “thousand” is < po’lun + -t?e, aug. suff., and hence means
“big hundred.” The term po'lunt?e ttha’yi ‘million’ means lit-
erally “big hundred (who is) old,” the word tiha’yi ‘‘she is old”’
being < t-, 3Fs pref., + -ha’yi “‘to be old.”’? The informant occa-
sionally used the adjective ha’yi ‘‘old”’ in place of the form ézha’yt,
giving the alternative expression po’lunt?cha’yi “old big hundred.”
   5.94 Before concluding the section on numerals certain other
words require mention: (1) Terms referring to given amounts of
money, e.g., di’su “dime,” te’skalahki “‘a bit,” and la’spit?e “a
dollar,’”’ are like numerals in that they must be followed by a nu-
meral defining the number of dimes, bits, dollars involved. (2) The
postposition and adverb ti’ri& “in front of; ahead’’ is also used
with the meaning “‘first,’”’ in its adverbial, not its ordinal, sense.
(3)   The   special    form        ?a’milta     ‘both’?    seems   to    contain     the
numeral ?2’lc ‘“‘two”’ but further analysis is not possible.","[83, 84]"

                           2.24    VOCALIC     SYNCOPE  2.241  In the process of combining grammatical elements into
words a vowel which would come to stand before ? is ordinarily1In any other similar circumstances assimilation cannot occur. Thus a after a
 remains a; ¢ after 7, e, a, 0, or u remains 1; u after 1, e, a, 0, or u remains u; 9
   after 7, e, a, 0, or wremains 9. No other successions of vowels separated by ?
   are found.
 2 The informant rarely uses this word and is somewhat uncertain as to its pre-
     cise meaning.

syncopated unless it stands at the end of a monosyllabic stem or
prefix.? Examples:
           9q/k?uhki he entered < ?a’ka to enter + ?u’hke he did
           9a'm?chkini I went < ?a'mi to go + ?a'hkini I did
           la'p?aho not good < la’pu good + -?aha not
But note the lack of syncopation in the case of monosyllabic ele-
ments:
           po’ ?uhki he looked < po’ to look + ?u’hki
           ta’?eru laugher < ta’-, agentive pref., + ?e’ru to laugh
In addition to the regular exceptions just noted, there are a few
irregular cases in which vocalic syncope does not occur before ?,
as in to’mahka?o'Staku (1) ‘the blue alligator” where we should ex-
pect to find *to’mahk?o'staku.?
   2.242 Another common type of vocalic syncope is found under
the following circumstances: When a stem ending in hki, &, ni, li,
or 71 comes to stand before a grammatical element beginning in a
consonant, the 7 may be syncopated unless its stem has a stressed
penult. Examples: *
          ta’tiht?e river < ti'tthki bayou + -t?<, augmentative suff.
          no'kusnu'hét female bear < no'kusi bear + nu’/hci female
          20! Skace’hkint?e large pot < ?0'Skace'hkini pot + -t?e, aug. suff.
          ta'haranci the fiddle < ta’harani fiddle + -héi, Fs suff.
          ta’halta on the ground < ta’hali the ground + -hta on
          &'kurp?aha no knife < s¢t’kuri knife + -p?aha no
This type of syneopation, though of very wide occurrence, is not
obligatory and hence ?9’Skace'hkinit?e, for example, is just as ac-
ceptable as ?0’Skaée’hkint?e.
  2.243 Sporadic cases of vocalic syncope occur under tHe fol-
lowing circumstances: (1) Some stems ending in ni will syncopate
the 7 even though the penult is stressed. Such cases are mostly
confined to the stem ?0’nz “‘person,”’ as in 20’nrawa ‘‘white person,”
?0’nmeli “negro,” 20’nmahoni “Indian.”               (2) Certain stems ending
In hku will syncopate         the u, particularly secondary           noun    stems
derived by means of the diminutive suffix -to’hku, as in ta’satosi’-
numa “the puppies,” based on sa’tohku.                    (3) Stems ending in a
liquid or a nasal plus a vowel occasionally syncopate the vowel
* Most monosyllabic prefixes have a special form to be used before elements be-
  ginning in ?,
? It is possible that cases like this are errors, possibly errors induced by analogy.
 For example, in the same brief text in which the above form occurs we find the
 form to'mahkami'liku “the red alligator.” Since the final vowel of to’mahka
 cannot be syncopated in the latter word, it is possibly true that this fact has in-
  fluenced its retention in to’mahka?o'Staku.
* Some of the examples quoted here and elsewhere in 2.242, 2.243, and 2,244 in-
  volve consonantic as well as vocalic syncope; see 2.25.

Such instances are, however, exceedingly rare and seem to be con-
fined to careless or allegro speech, as in he’rpohk?una’ni (4a: aw)
“the watched,”’ based on the stems he’ra ‘“‘to watch” and po’ “to
look”’ ; ma’rhotutihé (48: d) ‘“‘when she finished clearing (the table),”’
based on ma’ru “to pick up” and ho’tu ‘“‘to finish”; s2’mhihki
‘“‘you (Fs) played,” based on 82’mz “‘to play.”
   2.244  There are a few noun stems beginning in a continuant
which usually syncopate the vowel of their first syllable when they
are preceded by the articular prefix ta’-. This type of syncopation
is undoubtedly archaic and occurs with a very limited number of
noun stems, most of which have alternative non-syncopated forms
which may be used in the same circumstances. However, the syn-
copated forms are usually preferred to the non-syncopated ones.
Note the following cases:
          ta'rku the tree, stick, wood < ta’- + r(t)'hku tree, stick, wood ?
          ta’hka the corn < ta’- + A(a)'hka corn
          ta'luni the field < ta’- + h(a)'luni field
          ta’l?ukini the village, town    < ta’- + h(a)'l?ukinz village, town
          ta’l?upisi the mud < ta’- + h(a)'l?upis? mud
          ta’st?e the horse < ta’- + s(a)’t?e horse
          ta’stohku the puppy < ta’- + s(a)/tohku puppy
Composite noun stems having one of the above stems as their first
member may also appear in syncopated form after ta’-, e.g.,
          ta'rkuya'honi the limb < ta’- + r(¢)’hkuya’honi limb
          ta'rkuwo’hku the box < ta’- + r(¢)'hkuwo'hku box
          ta’hkawi'sta the sweet corn < ta’- + h(a)’hkawz'sta sweet corn
          ta’hkapu’ri the mush < ta’- + h(a)’hkapu'ri mush
Non-syncopated forms of all these words (i.e., forms like ta’rihku,
ta’hahku, etc.) also occur though very rarely. Note also that since
this type of syncope is archaic, most noun stems do not employ it
even though they may begin in a continuant, e.g., ta’hahéu “‘the
sand” < ta’- + ha’héu “sand.”","[21, 22, 23]"

   Analysis.   All of the sg. and du. forms, except 1s and 3rs, are
based on a stem *-hki to which the appropriate inal. pron. prefixes
are attached. The du. infix used is -ni-, as in the case of the indep.
pers. pronouns, instead of the -n- characteristic of the pron. pre-
42                                 HAAS    TUNICAfixes. The form ?a’hkinz (1s) is based on a stem *?a’hki-, appar-
ently related to *-hki, this fact being the more likely since the 1s
stems of four other aux. verbs are related to their more usual stems
in the same way. The person and number of the 1s form are indi-
cated by the ending -nz which is the 1s ending of ali aux. verbs as
well as the regular 1s ending of the semelfactive paradigm of the
act. verb (4.521). The form ?a’ki (3¥s) is suppletive and anoma-
lous. The pl. forms of this paradigm are based on a suppletive
act. verb stem *?9’na- (used only here) and the various persons are
indicated by the regular pl. endings of the semelfactive paradigm
of the    act.   verb   (4.521).    The     form      ?9’nta   (3mp)     is irregularly

     Metathesized dual forms, involving the reversal of the last two
consonants, are occasionally used, e.g., ?2’nara, etc.
  This paradigm is defective in that the plural forms for 1, 2m,
and 2F are wanting. Possibly the corresponding dual forms could
be used to supply the lack.           Note also that the 3m and 3F plural
forms are not differentiated.             The paradigm of ?u’na (4.423) ex-
hibits these same peculiarities.
   Analysis. All of the sg. forms except 1, 2F, and 3F and all of
the du. forms except 2F are based on a stem *-ra, the persons being
indicated by the appropriate inal. pron. prefixes.                The form ?a’ranz
(1s) is based on a related stem *?a’ra- plus the 1s ending -nz,
while the form ?a’ra (3¥Fs) is possibly this same stem minus affixes.
The forms he’ra (2¥s) and he’rana (2FD) are based on still another
related stem *-a’ra, the person and gender being indicated by the
appropriate pron. prefix. The du. sign‘is a suffixed -na (or, in the
case of the alternative metathesized forms, an infixed -na-). This
same du. element is also used by ?u’na (4.423) and ?u’wa (4.425).
The pl. form na’?ara (3M-F) is suppletive and is based on the act.
verb stem na’ “‘to lie down” (regularly used outside of this para-
digm) plus the bare stem *-?ara. The pl. form of ?u’na is analogous.

for 1, 2M, and 2F while the 3mp and 3rpP forms are again not differ-
entiated.        Perhaps the corresponding dual forms could be used in
 Jace of the missing plural forms.
  Analysis.        All of the sg. forms except 1, 2¥r, and 3r, and all of the
du. forms except 2F are based on a stem *-na, the persons being
indicated by the appropriate pron. prefixes.  The form ?a’nani
(1s) is based on a related stem *?a’na- plus the 1s ending -nz. The
forms he’na (2Fs) and he’nana (2FpD) are based on still another re-
latea stem *-a’na, the person and gender being indicated by the
appropriate pron. prefix. The form ?a’é (3rs) is suppletive and
anomalous. The du. sign is a suffixed (or infixed) -na. The pl.
form ?u’k?era (38M-F) is suppletive and based on the act. verb stem

The forms he'sa (2¥s) and he'nasa, he'nsa (2¥Fp) are based on still

of the forms of this paradigm are based on a stem *’-ta.          The dif-
ferent persons are indicated by the appropriate pron. prefixes and
the regular du. infix -n- is used in the du. forms. The Is smlf. form
-hia’ni is based on a related stem *-hta’- plus the 1s ending -n1,
while the 1s hab. form ?a’tanz is built up in a similar manner except
that it uses a different, though related, stem *-?a’ta-. The forms
-he’ta (2Fs) and -he'nta (2FD-P) are based on still another related
stem *-a’ta. The 3rs form appears to be the bare stem -?a’ta while
the 3mp form -?a’nta appears to contain the stem *’-ta but is other-
wise unanalyzable.
   The forms of this paradigm are never used independently but
are employed only in the inflection of causative active verb stems
(4.54). Of the two 1s forms -hia’ni is used only in causative semel-
factive paradigms while -?a’tanz is used only in causative habitual
paradigms. All other forms of -?u’ta are to be classified as semel-
factives.

the informant occasionally used the verb as a masculine plural.
This verb is classed with the auxiliary verbs because, like them, it
has @ repetitive form made by reduplication (4.43).","[40, 41, 42, 43, 44]"
"It will be noted at once that a number of the stems which express
an emotional or a physical state resemble adjectives on the seman-
tic level. On the inflectional level, however, they are quite distinct
from adjectives. Whereas static verb stems, as mentioned above,
must be inflected by means of the inalienable pronominal prefixes,
adjectives are never permitted to undergo this or any other type
of inflection (3.3). Note the following contrasting pair of exam-
ples:

rendered as subjects in English translations (as above).
   4.722 The stem -e’rusa “to know”’ forms its dual in an irregu-
lar manner. Unlike other static verb stems it has a special dual
stem -e’runasa formed from -e’rusa by the insertion of a dual infix
-na- between its second vowel and the following consonant. The
dual stem is used for the 1p-p, 2mp-P, 2FD-P, 3MD, and 3FD-P forms
of its paradigm and the infix -n- belonging to the inalienable pre-
fixes is then omitted, e.g., 2e’runasd ‘“‘we know” (< %%-, in place of
9j-n-, 1p-P pref., + -e’runasa). The simple stem -e’rusa, on the
other hand, is used for all of the singular forms and for the 3mp
form, e.g., ?0’rusa “he knows” (< ?u-, 3ms pref., + -e’rusa);
se'‘rusa ‘they know” (< si-, 3mp pref., + -e’rusa).","[59, 60]"

before another word beginning in ? under the following circum-
               HANDBOOK       OF    AMERICAN    INDIAN   LANGUAGES              29stances:    (1) If the prior word           does not have    a stressed penult,
       1
e.g:
           tu’wak(u) ?u'’wako'ni. (20:e) The owl hooted.
           ka'nahk(u) ?unpi’ratik?ahéa'nt.  (84:b) They would            turn into
                something.
(2) If the prior word has a stressed penult but the following word
does not have a stressed first syllable, e.g.,
           Pu'w(t) 2one’nt.        (64:2) He was a person.
           ka’'k(u) 2chpo'?uhkt.   (33:a) Someone has seen me.
           sa’hk(u) 2uhta’p?eke'ni. (7B:c) She caught one.
Note that unlike the similar rule operating in internal sandhi
(2.231, 2.241), vocalic assimilation does not accompany the opera-
tion of this rule in external sandhi, e.g., ?0’n(z) 2asa’ni. (4B:c)
“A person was coming.”
   Note    also   the   following       circumstances    under   which    vocalic
apocope cannot occur before ?: (1) When the final vowel of the
prior word is itself preceded by ?, e.g.,
           po'lunt?e ?1’lin (428) two thousand
(2) When the prior word has a stressed penult and the following
word has a stressed first syllable, e.g.,
           sa'hku ?u'hkigskan (29:e) although there is one
           2usi’ra 2a'hkihtdn (48:bz) behind his back
There are, however, two irregular words having a stressed penult
which are always apocopated before ? whether or not the following
word has a stressed first syllable. These are hi’héi “here, there,’
as in hi(’)hé(2) ?u’kera’nt. (22c:e) “they remained there,” and
ka’ta “where,” as in ka(’)t(a) 2a'rahé (10:e) ‘where it lies.”
_ 2.322 Vocalic apocope also occurs in the case of words ending
In @ continuant plus a voiceless stop plus 7 or u and in the case of
words ending in a continuant plus 7 (except when these have a
Stressed penult). Many such cases are accompanied by conso-
nantic apocope      (2.33).        While this type of vocalic apocope is not
obligatory it is very common, e.g.,
           ta'l?ukin(é) (7) ka(’)t(a) 2a’rahé (10:e) where the town lies
  ta’wisi(hé) (2) wi’ &ihk?ara’ni. (5a:b) The water was rising.

 n the examples quoted here the apocopated vowel is placed in parentheses.
 hee a stress loss (2.35) is induced the stress sign is likewise placed in paren-

word hi’héi ‘here, there’”’ and various words ending in the diminvu- |

their penult may be stressed, e.g.,

   2.331   When words vocalically apocopated according to the
rules given in 2.322 and 2.323 would come to end in a consonant
group composed of a continuant plus a voiceless stop, they un-
dergo         consonantic        apocope      according      to   the    following     rules:
(1)    A voiceless       stop      which   would     stand   between      h and      another
voiceless stop is dropped, e.g.,
               hi’ Stahah(k) (1) ka'lina’?ara'ni.      (20:1) They were still standing.
               hi’kuwanah(k)(u) pi'tako'nt.          (42p) He walks like a panther.
(2) A voiceless stop preceded by any                         continuant      except h       is
dropped before another consonant, e.g.,
               ta’l?ukin(€) (2) ka(')t(a) 2a'ra&hé (10:e) where the town lies
               2uha’san(é) (2) ne’l?utéhé (4B:u) when he rolled his vines
 (3) A consonant group consisting of h plus a voiceless stop is:
 dropped before a continuant, e.g.,
               ta’hali(hé) (2) he'kina’ni. (4a:bj) The land was far away.
               ha’ Staha(hk) (2) wi'&ihk?ara'nt. (5B:e) It was still rising.
               ?u'kina(hk)(u) wi'kate’ni.        (19:b) It sounded like his uncle.
 But in a few sporadic cases an hk group is retained before h, e.g.,
 te’tehk(2) ho'tuéin (21:e) “the end of the bayou.” Exceptions occur-
 ring in the case of amalgamations are given in 2.34.
      2.332      Under    rule      (8) above      it is provided       that a consonant
 group containing h plus a voiceless stop is dropped before a con-
 tinuant. On the analogy of this regular rule we find that there
 are a few cases wherein such a consonant group is likewise dropped
 before a voiceless stop even though according to rule (2) the
 should be retained,? e.g.,
               ta’la(hé)(t) po’htuka'ni.      (44:2) He cut some cane.
               te’ Carate'raski(hé)(t)     éu’'tahé (36a:a) when they took the pal-
                      metto leaves.         Contrast with te'éarate’raskthé, éu’tahe
                     (36a:b)       wherein the Aé group is retained in phrase-final
                  position.
 1 Instances of this sort are probably irregular. They usually involve (on the
   morphological plane) the complete omission of the feminine singular gender-
   suffix (4.841) and it is difficult to determine whether this omission is the result
     of a somewhat sweeping type of external sandhi or whether a morphological
     error is involved. But note that the complete omission of the feminine singular
     gender-suffix is also induced by the operation of rules (2) and (3) above.

ceded by a vocalically apocopated word.                      Since every Tunica
word must begin in a consonant, instances of this sort are consid-
ered amalgamations. Examples:

                + (h)aka’liwan in order to stopIn addition we have one amalgamated word which never occurs in
non-amalgamated form, viz., ta’hkala’yihta (e.g., in 4B:bk) ‘‘on
the bank, shore” < ta’hkal- ‘‘the bank, shore” + (h)a’ythta. Ex-
cept for this one word amalgamations are probably to be con-
sidered as characteristic only of careless or allegro speech. They
would seem to result from a habit comparable to the English one
known as “running one’s words together.”","[27, 28, 29, 30]"

                              4.   INFLECTION                        4.1        GENERAL   REMARKS   Inflection is accomplished almost exclusively by means of syn-
tactic affixes of the inflective type. However, suppletion and re-
duplication are employed in the inflection of the auxiliary verbs
and the periphrastic inflection of active verbs is accomplished by
juxtaposition with auxiliary verbs.
   The primary paradigmatic categories of the verb consist of the
semelfactive, habitual, and repetitive aspects, and the conditional
mode. Each of these categories comprises a separate paradigm
and the inflectional categories of each paradigm consist of person,
number, and gender. On the other hand, the expression of the
future tense and of several types of modes (including an alterna-
tive method of expressing the conditional) is accomplished by
means of postfixes (i.e., syntactic affixes of the non-inflective
type) but does not function as a part of the inflectional system of
verbs as such.
   Two paradigms of personal pronouns are distinguished, the
dependent and the independent. The inflectional categories em-
ployed by both are the same as those of verbal paradigms, namely,
person, number, and gender.
   The primary categories of the noun are the indeterminative and
the determinative.     The latter is further subdivided into three
case-categories, the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.
It is noteworthy that whereas the gender and number of a noun are
of primary importance on the syntactic level, these are not ex-
plicitly defined on the morphological level except in the definitive
case.
     It will now be pertinent to further describe the inflectional cate-
gories of person, number,           and gender.    There are three persons
(first, second, and third), three numbers (singular, dual, and
plural), and two genders (masculine and feminine). Number dis-
tinctions are made in all three persons. Gender distinctions, how-
ever, are made in the second and third persons but not in the
first. The independent personal pronouns and all of the types of

given below the inalienable form of each prefix is given first and
the alienable form follows it. With the exception of the third per-
son masculine forms, the dual and plural forms fall together.

The alienable forms are made from the inalienable forms by the
addition of an element -hk- which, according to a regular phono-
mechanical rule (2.251), appears as -k- after prefixes ending in
-n-. The 1p-p, 2mp-p, 2Fp-p, and 3mp forms are composed of the
corresponding singular forms plus the dual infix -n-. The 3rp-P
form appears to be related to the 3mp form in exactly the same
manner,
   4.212 The inalienable prefixes are used with two sets of bound
Stems, possessed noun stems (4.83) and static verb stems (4.7);
these stems in turn may not occur without these prefixes, e.g.,
             ?0'stku his father < ?u- + -e'st father + -ku, Ms suff.
             wiwa'na you want < wi- + -wa’na to want
The dual inalienable prefixes are listed with the dual infix -n- set
off by hyphens to indicate that when these prefixes are attached
to bound stems beginning in a vowel (with the sole exception of
~€rusa “to know’’; see 4.722) the initial vowel of the stem con-
tracts with the prefix vowel (2.221) and the infix is then inserted
between the initial vowel and the following consonant, e.g.,
 O'nstku ‘their father’ < ?u-n- + -e’si + -ku.
38                               HAAS   TUNICA  4,213 The alienable prefixes are used with free stems. They
denote possession with noun stems (4.83) and objectivity with
active verb stems (4.56), e.g.,
         Puhk?t'yut?eku his hog < ?uhk- + ?2’yut?e hog + -ku
         2thk2e'h?uhki he kicked me < ?thk- + 2e’h?uhki he kicked
Note also that in the operation of the phonomechanical               rules of
consonantic syncope (2.25) the element -hk- of these prefixes is, in
the proper circumstances, reduced to -h- or lost entirely, e.g.,
         2thti’rahci my cloth < %hk- + tr’ra cloth + -hét, Fs suff.
         tisa’t?eku her horse < tihk- + sa’'t?e horse + -ku
In addition there are occasional analogical instances in which the
element -hk- is lost before stems beginning in voiceless stops; thus
27p0 ?uhkz in place of the more correct 27hpo’?uhki “he saw me”                <
?ahk- + po’?uhki “he saw.”","[35, 36, 37]"

* Due to the paucity of examples in which a stem ending in hk comes to stand
  ' lore another stem beginning in h, it is not possible to ascertain why there are
      0 different types of treatment under what seem to be identical circumstances.
26                               HAAS    TUNICA  2.255 The articular prefix ta’- ! takes the form ¢- before stems
beginning in ? and the ? in turn is regularly syncopated.? Ex-
amples:
           to’niku the man < t- + ?0’ni person + -ku, Ms suff.
           to’mahkaku the alligator < t- + ?9’mahka alligator + -ku
           te’yuse'laku the opossum < t- + ?2’yuse'la opossum + -ku   2.256 When § would come to stand before another §, one of
them is dropped. This rule applies in the case of stems ending in
§2 in circumstances which permit the syncopation of the 7 (2.242),
e.g,
           no'kusi’ male bear < no’kus(z) bear + sz’ male
           ka’pasi' rooster < ka’pas(z) chicken + &’                               2.26     HAPLOLOGY   Although instances of haplology are not common, the process is
found under the following circumstances: (1) When the last syl-
lable of the prior member of a composite noun stem consists of k
plus a vowel, this syllable is dropped if the second member begins
in k,* e.g.,
           te'rasko'ta cabbage < te’raski leaf -- ka'ta whitish, grayish
           ha’hkiri cornmeal < ha'hka corn + ki'ri ground
           rt hkora table < ri’hku wood + ko’ra disc-shaped
           ri'hkora wagon,    composed    of the same elements as the above
                except that here the meaning implied is “that which is
                characterized by having disc-shaped wood, 1.e., wheels’’
(2) Noun stems beginning in ¢ usually omit the articular prefix
ta’- by haplology, e.g.,
           te’teht?eku the river < ts'tiht?e river + -ku, ms suff.
           to'rahkiku the ice < ta’rahki ice + -ku
But analogical reformations           containing ta’- also occur, as in the
case of ta’titihi?eku and ta’tarahkiku which may be used in place of1 This prefix is not to be confused with the agentive prefix ta’-. The latter always
 appears in the form ta’- including the cases wherein it is used before a stem be-
  ginning in ?, e.g., ta’/?eru “laugher.”
2 Tn rare cases we find analogical reformations in which ta’- rather than ¢- is used
  before stems beginning in ?, e.g., ta’?udehkato'nayihti (10:g) “Old Toad
 Woman.”     A similar slip occurred with the word to’sinlu’piku (15:b) ‘‘Whoop-
 ing Crane” which was originally dictated in the form ta’?osinlu'piku; the in-
 formant later corrected himself voluntarily.
3 This type of haplology is sporadic and, as far as I have been able to ascertain,
 does not occur except in the examples given below. In similar circumstances
 other composites are formed without haplology, e.g., ha’hkako’pu “parched
 meal.”’ Moreover, the composite stem ha’/hkiri “cornmeal” sometimes occurs in
 non-haplologized form, viz., ha’hkaki’ri.
              HANDBOOK       OF   AMERICAN        INDIAN    LANGUAGES             27
the above forms.          On the other hand, proper nouns beginning in ¢
never take ta’-, e.g.,
             ta’hé?thci the Sun < ta’hé?i + -hét, Fs suff.
             ti’ Slinahéi the Stone Witch    < ti’ Slina + -héLikewise, agentive noun stems (derived by means of the agentive
prefix ta’-) may never take the articular prefix, e.g.,
             ta'haranci the fiddle < ta’harani fiddle + -héi
             ta'haraku the singer < ta’hara singer + -ku
(3) There are a very few sporadic cases of distant haplology, viz.,
ta'hkato’muku        (54:8) for ta’hkata’tomuku             (found in 5B:a)     “the
mortar” and ta’yanisne'raku               (438)     for    ta'yanisya'neraku    ‘‘the
ocean bull (mythical).”’                      2.27    STRESS    LOSSES      AND    SHIFTS   2.271 All free stems and most bound stems have an intrinsic
primosyllabic stress, while the remaining bound stems have an in-
trinsic pre-primosyllabic stress, i.e., a stress which is placed on
whatever prefix is attached to the stem, e.g., ’-ki “maternal un-
cle,” !as in ?u’kiku “‘his maternal uncle.” All stems, then, have an
intrinsic stress. In addition, a few monosyllabic prefixes and a few
polysyllabic (but not monosyllabic) suffixes and postfixes have an
intrinsic primosyllabic stress. When grammatical elements are
put together to form words, their intrinsic stresses are retained
wherever possible, but since two stressed syllables may not occur
consecutively (1.1), certain accommodations (consisting of stress
losses and shifts) are necessary when two intrinsically stressed
syllables occur in juxtaposition. These are discussed in the fol-
lowing paragraphs.
   2.272 When a monosyllabic or syncopated disyllabic stem is
followed by another element having an intrinsic stress, the latter
loses its stress, e.g.,
             po'?aki she looked     < po’ to look + ?a'ki she did
             ha'r?aki she sang < ha'ra to sing + ?a'ki
             po’kati she looks < po’ + -ka’ti, 3rs ending
             ?una’ §am?u'hki he took him and went < ?uhk-, 3Ms pref.,
                  + na'st to take . . . + 2a'mi to go + ?u'hki he did
     2.273     When a stem is combined with a stressed monosyllabic
Prefix, the stem loses its stress, €.g.,
          ta’ naraku the snake < ta’-, art. pref., + na’ra snake + -ku, Ms
                  suff.
             ta’wisthci the water    < ta’- + wi’si water + -héi, Fs suff.

                                                                                   the
    Stress diacritic placed in front of the stem, as in this example.

na'ra + -ku) wherein na’ra retains its intrinsic stress because the
prefix lacks such stress.
   2.274 When a monosyllabic noun stem is preceded by a stress-
less monosyllabic prefix, the stress of the stem shifts to the prefix
whenever the stem is followed by a monosyllabic suffix, a stressed
polysyllabic suffix, or another stem, e.g.,             ti’risi to her house < tehk-, 3Fs pref., + rz’ house + -s to
             ?y'saku his dog < ?uhk-, 3ms pref., + sa’ dog + -ku, Ms suff.
             ?u'sasi’nima his dogs < ?uhk- + sa’ + -st'’nima, Fo-P suff.
             2u'yata’hkist his deerskin < ?uhk- + ya’ deer + ta’hkist skinMonosyllabic verb stems, in contrast to noun stems, retain their
primosyllabic stress under such circumstances, e.g., ?uhpo’wi ‘“‘he
saw him” (< ?uhk- + po’ “to see .. .”? + -wi, 3Ms endg.).
   2.275 When a word which has a stressed penult is combined
with a stressed disyllabic postfix beginning in a vowel, the word
loses its penultimate stress, e.g.,             mile’ni it is red < mi’li red + -a'ni, quot. postf.
             niko'ni he says < ni’ku he says + -a'ni
             lo'takata’ni they run < lo’taka’ta they run + -a'ni     2.276    When a      disyllabic word with a stressed penult has a
prefix in front of it, the stress of its penult will shift to the prefix
as soon as the word is combined with a stressed disyllabic postfix
beginning in a vowel, e.g.,             te’mile’ni it is red all about < te- all about + mi’li + -a'ni
             ?u'niko'nt he says to him < ?uhk-, 3ms pref., + ni’ku + -a’ni

                     4.32     THE   THREE    CLASSES     OF   VERBS   On the basis of certain fundamental differences in method of in-
flection Tunica distinguishes three classes of verbs: auxiliary,
active, and static.
     The auxiliary verbs have the following unique characteristics:
(1) All of them exhibit the same general types of irregularities in
inflection, namely, that certain forms are inflected like non-inchoa-
tive static verbs, others like non-causative active verbs in the
semelfactive aspect, while still others are unanalyzable. (2) Cer-
tain of these irregularities are occasioned by the use of supple-
tion, a process not used by any other word-class of the language.
(3) Reduplication is regularly employed in the formation of their
repetitive paradigms, and, like suppletion, is not used elsewhere in
the language. (4) All of these verbs are employed in the peri-
phrastic inflection of active verbs although all but one of them
may also be used independently.
     The     characteristics of active verbs, which fall into two inflec-
tional categories           (non-causative    and     causative), are as follows:
(1) Non-causatives are inflected              (a)   by suffixation, as exhibited
in the use of the semelfactive, habitual, and conditional sets of
endings, or (b) by juxtaposition, as exhibited in periphrastic con-
structions involving the auxiliary verbs. (2) Causatives are nor-
mally inflected only by juxtaposition. (3) Both types of verbs are
inflected for object by means of the alienable pronominal prefixes.
   Static verbs exhibit the following inflectional traits: (1) Their
non-inchoative forms are constructed by means of the inalienable
pronominal prefixes which function on the grammatical level as
objects, on the interpretive level as subjects. (2) Their inchoative
forms are constructed by the use of certain active verb inflec-
tional elements but at the same time retain the inalienable pro-
nominal prefixes in the function just described.
                   HANDBOOK         OF   AMERICAN           INDIAN    LANGUAGES                41             4.4        Tuer     INFLECTION      OF     THE    AUXILIARY     VERBS
                                  4.41    GENERAL           REMARKS
   The primary paradigmatic categories of these verbs are the
semelfactive and repetitive aspects and the conditional mode.
Fach verb has a separate paradigm for each of these notions except
that the causative auxiliary lacks a repetitive paradigm.      The
pasic paradigm in every case is the semelfactive one and the other
two paradigms are formed from this basic one according to the
regular rules provided in 4.43 and 4.44.
   For convenience, each auxiliary verb except la’ka (an anoma-
Jous plural verb) is referred to by its third person singular mascu-
line semelfactive form, that being, as a rule, the least ambiguous
form. The complete list of auxiliary verbs follows:
              ?u'hki he is, was; he exists, existed; he lives, lived (is, was alive)
              ?u'ra he lies, lay; he is, was lying; he is, was situated (of that
                   whose normal position is conceived to be a lying one)
              ?u’na he sits, sat; he is, was sitting; he lives, lived (dwells,
                   dwelt); he camps, camped; he is, was living, dwelling,
                        camping;    he stays,     stayed; he remains,      remained;        he is,
                        was situated (of that whose normal position is conceived
                        to be a sitting or squatting one)
              ?u'sa he comes, came; he is, was coming
              ?u'wa he goes, went; he is, was going
              -?u’ta he causes, caused
              la'ka they live, lived (dwell, dwelt); they are, were living, dwell-
                    ing (an anomalous 3m-FP verb)
All of these verbs except -?u’ta are used independently as well as
in the periphrastic inflection of active verbs. In their independent
usage they make no distinction between the semelfactive and
habitual aspects; the semelfactive paradigm is used for both. The
definitions given above cover the semantic range of their inde-
pendent usage; the ideological complexities involved when they
are employed in periphrasis are discussed in 4.53.","[39, 40]"
"                4.5     Tue      INFLECTION       OF     ACTIVE   VERBS                              4.51      GENERAL    REMARKS      4.511   Active        verb stems     fall into two main        categories,    the
non-causative and the causative, each of which has its own special
characteristics of inflection. While there are a number of cases in
which it is not possible to make a distinction between the two
types of stems except on the formal level, the terminology ‘‘non-
causative” vs. ‘‘causative”’ is based on the following circum-
stance: Any non-causative intransitive stem may be transitivized
by     being transferred         from     the   non-causative     to the   causative
category.      Thus, to mention only one of numerous examples, we
find that ha’pa has the function of an intransitive stem meaning.
“to stop, cease’ when it undergoes non-causative inflection but:
assumes the function of a transitive stem meaning “‘to cause . . «:
to stop, cease’? when it undergoes causative inflection.     (Other:
instances in which a given stem may be inflected in both categories
with a similar difference in meaning are provided in 5.212.)
   In contrast to those cases in which there is a clearcut semantic
distinction between the non-causative and causative categories, it
is found      that some       stems     are always       inflected in the causative
category even though their meanings do not reflect the notion of
causativity.         Some    of these     are transitive,     e.g., wi’sa..c.    (read::
wt’sa, causative verb stem) ‘“‘to tease . . .,”’ S’hka..c. ‘to help,
aid . . .,’’ while others are intransitive, e.g., ?u’ru. .c. “to whoop,
shout,” wi’ra..c. “to count.”
   4.512 The chief differences in inflection between the non-
causative and causative categories may be summarized as follows:
(1)    In the case of non-causative verbs inflection for pronominal
subject is accomplished by suffixation or by juxtaposition.                     Suffix-
ation is utilized when the semelfactive, habitual, and conditional
sets of inflectional endings are employed.                 Juxtaposition is used in
periphrasis which consists in placing the stem of 2 non-causative
verb in front of an inflected form of any auxiliary except the
causative.     (2)    In the case of causative verbs, on the other hand,
inflection for pronominal subject is normally accomplished only by
juxtaposition.        Their semelfactive, habitual, and conditional para-
               HANDBOOK           OF    AMERICAN       INDIAN       LANGUAGES                   47  ipms require the use of the causative auxiliary but other types of
   # phrastic inflection (involving the use of the other auxiliaries)
are also possible provided certain special formational rules are
applied.              us     gs                    ;             ,
   4.513        The distinction between non-causative and causative
yerbs is maintained only in the type of subjective inflection each
uses; in objective inflection (4.56) the two types fall together.
Note also that unlike the stems of auxiliary and static verbs, the
stems of active verbs (both non-causative and causative) may be
used independently; in this usage they are infinitives.","[45, 46]"
"     2.42   STRESS   LOSSES AND      SHIFTS REQUIRED    BY PAUSE   FORMS   2.421   Since all of the phrase-final melodies preclude a stress on
the ultima of the words with which they are used, special incre-
mental pause forms are constructed for words which would other-
wise have a stress on their ultima (2.48, rule 5).
   2.422 In the case of words which take the rising and low
phrase-final melodies on their penultima (1.6), their penultimate
stress, if any, is lost, e.g.,
           lo'‘hkatohku (9:i) a basket < la’hkato'hku
          to'kasiku (4B:ad) the boy < to’kasi'ku
  2.423 The high and falling phrase-final melodies, which must
always be placed on the ultima, induce the loss of a penultimate
stress, e€.g.,
            2asdé (4B:a0) she is coming < ?a’sa
            lo'takant (16:b) I (can) run < b’taka’ni
            po?5n (4a:ax) look! < po’?9 you Fs look + -n, imperative postf.
But in the case of a trisyllabic word having a penultimate stress
and a prefix in its first syllable, the stress will shift to the prefix,
e.g.,
            ho’ poki he looks out < hopo'’ku
            ?u’wand (13:k) he wants < ?uwa’na
On the other hand, if such a word is preceded by a monosyllabic
or apocopated disyllabic word in the same phrase, this shift can-
not occur.       The preceding word has an inherent stress which takes
precedence over the non-inherent stress (because resulting from
shifting) of such words as ?2’wand ‘I want.”’ Note the following
contrasting pair of examples:
            lo’t 2iwand. (16:1) I want to run.
            ka'na ya' ?ik?thé, ?1’wand. (144:q) I want you to do something.

     9.43      RULES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF PAUSE FORMS
   The rules given below take care of the construction of all types
of pause forms. It is to be remembered throughout that each of
these rules may be accompanied by stress losses and shifts in ac-
cordance with the rules just given.
  (1) Predicative         words   ending in vowels    are set off as pause
forms by the use of the appropriate phrase-final melody, e.g.,
            tarts 2a'hkint, 2u’niko’nt. (16:m) “I am ahead,” he told him.
            tiya’hpa, ni'kate’nt. (8a:b) She said she was hungry.
            wi'yaki. (148:p) Go!","[31, 32]"
"                      2.25    CONSONANTIC         SYNCOPE   2.251  Anh which would come to stand between a continuant
and a voiceless stop is dropped. Examples:
          ?inta’t?e our brother < ?7-n-, 1p pref., + -hta’t?e brother
          ?u'ruhtané when I whoop < ?u/ruhta’n(t) I whoop + -hé when
1 The latter are probably to be interpreted as reformations induced by the anal-
 ogy of the large number of noun stems which have no syncopated forms.    Hence
 the use of the non-syncopated forms of stems which also have syncopated forms
 is comparable to the English situation wherein “‘oxes” is used in substandard
  speech for ‘‘oxen.”’
2 In this and succeeding examples a syncopated vowel is placed in parentheses.

monymous stems ri’hkora meaning “table” and “wagon,” re-
spectively. These drop the r and retain the h when preceded by
the articular prefix giving the articularized form ta’hkara for both
stems.
   2.252   A k which would come to stand between                    an A and     a
voiceless stop is dropped. Examples:
          ti'tiht?e river < ti’tihk(z) bayou + -é?e, aug. suff.

   2.253 An hk group which would come to stand before a con-
tinuant other than h is dropped. Examples:
          2a'Sume’li Easter day < ?a'Suhk(t) day + me’lt black
          ta’ kosust'’nima the crawfish < ta’- + ko’suhk(z) crawfish + -sz’-

          ?usa’t?e his horse < ?uhk-, 3ms pref.,       + sa’t?e horse
  2.254     In the case of an hk group which would come to stand
before h two different procedures are followed: (1) When a prefix
ending in hk comes to stand before a stem beginning in h, the hk
is dropped as before all other continuants, as in
          ?uha'l?eki she sent him < ?uhk-, 3ms pref., + ha’l?eki she sent
          ?tha'sant my vine < %hk-, 1s pref., + ha’sani vine
(2) When a theme ending in hk comes to stand before an auxiliary
verb beginning in h, the hk is retained and the h is dropped, as in          yu'kthke'ra you are cooking < yu'kihk- to be cooking + he'ra
                you (FS) are.      . . -ing
But there are two irregular examples found when a stem ending in
hk is followed by another stem beginning in h. In one case the hk
is dropped and the his retained, viz., t2’/Suha'hka “window”                < ti’-
Suhk(i) “door” + ha’hka “opening.”’ In the other case the hk is
retained and the h is dropped, viz., 2a’yimuhke'ri “‘steamboat”’? <
?a yrmu’hk(z)    “smoke, steam”          + he’ri “boat.” !

It will be noted that certain of the habitual endings are identical
with the semelfactive endings, viz., 2mp, 2Fp, 3FD, 2MP, 2FP, and
8FP.   This is explained in the following paragraph.
  There        is obviously           an historical connection              between        the two
Paradigms.          Except in the case of the identical forms, the habitual
endings are built up of an element -ka-, -k-, or -hk- followed by the
48                             HAAS    TUNICAsemelfactive endings. This element is probably connected with
the habitual thematic suffix -hk- (discussed in 5.213). It appears
in the form -ka- before monosyllabic semelfactive endings other
than those beginning in ?, the form -ku (8ms) being contracted
 < *-ka'wi. Before monosyllabic endings beginning in ? the ele-
ment appears in the form -k- with the consequent loss of the ?,
Before disyllabic endings beginning in ?, the element appears in
the form -hk-, but before disyllabic endings beginning in other
consonants, the element does not appear at all; hence the identical
forms in the two paradigms. Since all of the disyllabic endings be-
ginning in consonants other than ? begin in a continuant, the non-
appearance of -hk- is to be ascribed to the regular phonomechani-
cal rule providing for the syncopation           of an hk group   before   a
continuant (2.253, 2.254).","[46, 47]"
"                            5.4     Noun    STEMS
                     5.41         GENERAL   REMARKS  Secondary noun stems are of four main types: (1) those formed
by adding one of two derivative suffixes to a primary stem, 5.42;
            HANDBOOK          OF     AMERICAN   INDIAN      LANGUAGES            75(2) those    formed     by     the    juxtaposition    of two    primary   stems,
5.43; (3) agentives, 5.44; and (4) those derived by implicit proc-
ess, 5.45. It should also be noted that once a given type of sec-
ondary stem has been formed it may in its turn serve as the basis
for building other stems in the same way that a primary stem may
(5.46).
                    5.42       THE     DERIVATIVE     SUFFIXES  Two derivative suffixes, the augmentative and the diminutive,
are used in deriving noun stems from noun stems.                  The use of the
augmentative suffix -t?e may be illustrated by the following ex-
amples:
          sa't?e horse < sa’ dog + -t?e large
          ru’ stat?e sheep < ru’ sta rabbit ++ -t%e
          te’tiht?e river < te’tihki bayou, stream + -t?e
   The diminutive suffix appears in the form -to’hkwu in all situa-
tions except before the ms suffix -ku; in the latter situation it ap-
pears in the form -to’ho-, e.g., ta’kuwato’hoku “‘the bird”                <   ta’-,
art. pref., + ku’wato’ho- “bird” + -ku, ms suff.                   Examples       of
diminutive derivation are:
          ku'wato’hku, -to'ho- bird < ku’wa duck + -to’hku, -to'ho-
          sa'tohku, -to’ho- puppy        < sa’ dog + -to’hku, -to'ho-
          ni'nito'hku, -to'ho- minnow < ni’nt fish + -to’hku, -to'ho-
          ya'ruhto’hku, -to'ho- hatchet < ya’ruhki ax + -to’hku, -to’ho-                             5.43     COMPOSITE     STEMS
   5.431  Composite noun stems are formed by juxtaposition and
are of two main types: (1) those composed of a noun stem plus an
adjective stem and (2) those composed of a noun stem plus a
noun stem.
   5.432   Noun stem plus adjective stem composites fall into two
classes: generic and characteristic. The former are endocentric,
the latter exocentric.!
   (1) Generic composites are built up of a noun stem having a
generic significance followed by an adjective stem which descrip-
tively limits the application of the noun              stem to which it is at-
tached, e. g.,
          na'rame’li congo snake < na’ra snake + me’li black
          20’nrawa white person < ?0’nt person + ro’wa white
          wi’ Stru’wina whisky < wz’& water, liquid + ru’wina hot
   (2) Characteristic noun stem plus adjective stem composites
are built up of a noun stem which signifies a part of the entity to
‘ Bloomfield, op. cit., pp. 235-6.
76                             HAAS     TUNICAwhich the composite refers followed by an adjective which de.
scribes the part. This gives a composite meaning “‘one who, that
which is characterized by having            . . .,’ e.g.,
         29! Skayo'ta (kind of) fern < ?9' Ska root + yo’ta rotten; hence,
               that which is characterized by having rotten roots
         ?9' Skame'li (kind of) wild potato < ?0'ska + me'lt black; hence,
             that which is characterized by having black roots
        te'rasko'ta cabbage < te’raski leaf + ko'ta grayish, whitish;
              hence that which is characterized by having whitish leaves   5.483   Noun stem plus noun stem composites likewise fall into
two classes: determinate and copulative.
   (1) In the case of determinate noun stem plus noun stem com-
posites the determining element, as a general rule, has the prior
position, e.g.,        yu’ Sho'sant (kind of) vine < yi’si raccoon + ho’sani vine;
               hence lit., raccoon-vine
        2a’lako’hku terrapin < ?a’la reed, cane + ko’hku turtle; hence
               lit., cane-turtle
        ta’lunti'tihki, proper n., Bayou des Glaise < ta’-, art. pref.,
              + ha‘lunt field + ts’tihki bayou; hence lit., the field-bayouIn contrast to the above type of examples                   (oi which there are
dozens) there are a very few determinate composites in which the
determining element comes last. At least one of these admits of
free transposition, viz., na’rurt’hku or ri’hkuna'ruhki “pestle.” In
the first form, na’ruri'‘hku (< na’ruhki “mortar” + ri’hku
“‘stick’’), the determining element comes first.              The second form,
ruhkuna'ruhki, is composed of the same elements transposed so
that the determining element comes last. One might argue that
the second form is an error but for the fact that the informant
feels there is no real difference between them.
   (2) In copulative noun stem plus noun stem composites the
elements are coordinate, the whole having the meaning “he who,
that which isa ...anda...,’ eg.,
        yo'ronéo'ha   Tunica    chief   <     yo'ront   Tunica    +   ‘ha    chief;
             hence, he who is a Tunica and a chief
        ku'wata’ puheu nighthawk < ku'wa duck + ta’puhéu discharger
             of wind; hence, that which is a duck (or bird) and a dis-
             charger of wind
        ?a’/lata'wuci whistle < ?a’la reed, cane             +   ta’wuct whistler;
              hence, that which is a reed and                a   whistler   5.484 Certain composites contain bound stems and if such
stems occur in second position it is not possible to determine
whether they are adjectival or nominal stems. A number of bound
           HANDBOOK         OF    AMERICAN      INDIAN     LANGUAGES              77
stems occur only in one composite and in such cases the meaning
is usually unknown.         A few examples are:
          27'yuse'la opossum < ?2’yu- + -Se'la; cf. ?7’yut?e hog < ?2’yu-
                + -é%c, aug. suff.
          S'laka'lu.    spider < S'la worm, insect + -ka’lu, meaning un-
               known
          rt'hkuya’honi limb of a tree < ri’hku tree, stick, wood + -ya’-
               honi, meaning unknown
          te/rasa'nt    handkerchief < tz’ra_      cloth   + -sa’ni,   meaning   un-
                known                                 5.44   AGENTIVES  5.441    Agentive noun stems are formed from active verb stems
by means of the agentive prefix ta’-, not to be confused with the
articular prefix ta’-, t (4.821).          The agentive prefix, unlike the
articular prefix, always appears in the form ta’-, even before stems
beginning in ?, e.g., ta’?eru “laugher” < ta’- + ?e’ru “to laugh.”
Other examples of the use of this prefix are:
          ta’hiru file < ta’- + hi'ru to rub
          ta’hara singer < ta’- + ha’ra to sing
          ta’hipu dancer < ta’- + hi’pu to dance
Agentives formed from causative stems have the causative suffix
-ni (5.212), e.g.,
          ta’harani fiddle < ta’- + ha’ra..c. to play (an instrument)
          ta'makini plow < ta’- + ma’ki..c. to plow   5.442 Agentives frequently occur as second members of noun
stem plus noun stem composites. Note the following points with
respect to this usage: (1) If the second member is an intransitive
agentive (i.e., an agentive < an intransitive stem), the composite
is copulative, e.g.,
          2a'lata’wuct whistle      < a reed and a whistler
          2a'lata’ Suru blow-gun < a reed and a blower(2) If the second member is a transitive agentive to which the
first member stands in objective relation, the composite is deter-
minate, e.g.,
          nt’ nita’ ?ert fish-hawk < fish-lifter
          na’ kata’watani (kind of) insect < warrior-concealer(3) But if the second member is a transitive agentive to which
the first member does not stand in objective relation, the com-
posite is copulative, e.g.,
          rt'hkuta'tomu pestle < a stick and a pounder
          rv’ hkuta'peka war-club < a stick and a beater
78                             HAAS        TUNICA            5.45   MISCELLANEOUS           NOMINAL      DERIVATIVES     There are a few noun stems derived by implicit process from
stems belonging to another word-class.                In addition, there are jp.
stances in which noun stems of one category (specifically, non.
possessed noun stems) are derived from noun stems of another
category (specifically, possessed noun stems).
   Noun stems derived from adjective stems by implicit procesg
include the following:
          ni’sara young person < ni’sara young (which may represent 9
               special kind of abbreviation of the composite ?0’ninz' sarg
               young person)
          to’stohku, to’stoho- little one < to’stohku small (related in some
               way to the diminutive suffix -to’hku, -to’ho-, 5.42, and
               resembling it in having a special form to’stoho- to be used
               before the ms suff. -ku)
   Noun stems derived from active verb stems by implicit process
include the following:
          hi'pu dance < hi’pu to dance
          ha’ra song < ha’ra to sing
          ka'na step, pace < ka’na to step, step over
          ko'la flower < koa‘la to bloom
          ?u’cu breast < ?u’éu to suckle
   As has already been shown, two inherently determinative nouns
are derived from the static verb stem -ha’yi (4.71). These are
2uha'yi “the old man” (< “he is old’) and tiha’yi “the old
woman” (< “she is old’’); see 4.823.
   Most interesting of all cases of implicit process, however, are
those in which inalienably possessed nouns used with the 3Ms
pronominal prefix have       come      to be independent         (i.e., non-pos-
sessed) nouns by virtue of specialization as to meaning, e.g.,
          29' Ska root < ?u-, 3ms pref., + -a’ ska foot
          ?0’sint?e big knot on a tree < ?u- + -e’sint?e big head
          20'sinlu'pi whooping crane < ?o’sini + lu’pi dead (character-
                istic composite); ?0’sini < ?u- + -e’sint head            5.46   NOUN    STEMS      OF    COMPLEX      FORMATION
     As would be expected, some of the composite stems of Tunica
have as one or each of their members a noun stem which is itself a
secondary stem formed by one or the other of the formational
techniques already discussed.          Note     that no composite or other
type of secondary stem may             have     more than two immediate
members though either or both of these may be secondary. For
example, ?0’nrawaka'Si “Frenchman” is not to be analyzed as
20'nt + ro'wa + ka’&i.      Instead,        it must    first be broken up into
           HANDBOOK       OF    AMERICAN      INDIAN    LANGUAGES              7999'nrawa ‘‘white person”         + ka’s “real,    original’! and       then the
frst element ?o’nrowa can be broken up into ?0'nz “person” +
ro'wa “white.” Other instances of complex formations are the
following:
          2o'nmelim2’li mulatto < ?0’nmelt negro + mili red; ?0’n-
               meli < ?0'nt + me'li black

               eater; ta’saku < ta’- + sa’ku to eat
         29' Skame'li (kind of) wild potato < ?0'ska root + me’li black;
               29’ Ska, specialization < ?u-, 3ms pref., + -a’ ska foot        5.47    ABBREVIATION         OF    SECONDARY    NOUN     STEMS   Once they have been introduced into the context certain sec-
ondary noun stems may thereafter, at the discretion of the narra-
tor, be abbreviated. This is particularly true in the case of aug-
mentativized stems and of determinate or copulative composites,
€.g.,
         ta’ Skaée'hkint?cku (7a:e) the kettle < #-, art. pref., + 79’ skaée’-
               hkint?e + -ku, ms suff.; 20’ Skadée’hkint?e < ?0' Skaée’hkini
               pot + -t?e, aug. suff. This form may be abbreviated to

                                 9.1      GENERAL      REMARKS
  The      preverbs and postfixes are discussed in connection with
syntax for two reasons, (1) because they are attached only to
formally complete words, and (2) because for the most part the
rules for their use are based on the syntactic classification of the
words to which they are attached.                      Some linguists prefer to sepa-
rate such elements from the words to which they are subjoined by
means of hyphens. In Tunica such a device would prove imprac-
tical because several of the postfixes undergo contraction with the
final vowel of the words to which they are attached (2.22), e.g.,
nara’ni “it was a snake, it is said” (< na’ra + -a’ni, quot. postf.);
to’hcét “she, on her part” (< te’he + -hat “on .. .’s part’);
nika'ni “he was saying, it is said” (< ni’ku + -a’nt).
                                    9.2     Tur      PREVERBS  9.21         The      preverbs       are most       widely    used       with     active   verb
predicative words.               However, one of them (te- “about, all about’’)
may also be used with a noun or adjective predicative word.
  (1) te- “about, all about,” e.g.,
               tewe’sasite’ni, ta'wis ha’ytht.         (5B:e) They were jumping about
                       on the water.          (tewe’sasite’nt < te- + we'sasite’ni            they
                       were jumping)
               ?awa’ Cihk?u’ranahé, teha’hpaya'ni. (4B:g) As they fought to-
                    gether, there was noise all about.    (teha’hpaya’ni < te-
                    + ha'hpaya'ni there was noise)
               te'mile’ni       (var. for mile’ni, 20:h) it was red all about.               (< te-
                       + mile’ni it was red)
      (2) ki- “in, into,” e.g.,
             2u'nir kt’ ?uhpe'k?uhke’ni.   (14871) he hit him in his teeth.
                   (kt ?uhpe'k?uhke'nt < kt- + ?uhpe’k?uhke'ni he hit him)
               ?uso'hu ki'Gin, ki!?uhpe'k?uhke’ni.              (144:j) he hit him in his
                       mouth?

? Note that in this example the postposition k7’¢u “in, into” is used in addition to
  the preverb ki- whereas in the immediately preceding example the preverb 1s
  used alone. Whether or not the use of the postposition in addition to the pre-
 verb involves a redundancy cannot be ascertained because the available exam-
 ples are more or less evenly divided between the two types of treatment.

           ta’wis ha'yihtan, hopo'rusi'tihé (15:g) when they float out on
                 the rater (hopo’rust’tihé < ho- + po’rusi’tihé when they
                 float
           ta’yt ra'hpdn, ho'poko'ni. (10:k) He was looking out near the
                 fire. (ho'poko'ni < ho- + poko'ni he was looking)

                 < ho- + po’wihé when he looked)
In addition to the types of cases illustrated above wherein ho-
may be freely attached to an active verb form, there is one bound
active verb stem which is not used without ho-, viz., ho-. . pi’ “to
get out, emerge,” e.g.,
           hopi’?uhki     (4a:v) he got out
In case ho-. . pi’ is linked with another active verb stem the pre-
verb may precede either stem, e.g.,
           na'rahopi' ?eta’nt_ (18:e)     she flew out < she flew and got       out
           hona'rapi' ?uwdhé (42p) when he flew out < when he flew and
                got out
   (4) ha- “up, down.” This preverb is used somewhat idiomati-
cally and its meaning is perhaps best described as resultative as
in “‘to stand up,” ‘‘to kneel down,”’ e.g.,
           hatu'hkupa’takate'ni. (4a:h) She fell to her knees < kneeled
                aie and fell. (< ha- + tw’hkupa'takate'ni she kneeled and
                fe
           hasu'hp?ake'nt        (2:b)   it closed up.    (< ha- + Su’hp?ake'ni it
                closed)
           ha'tikan, haka'likate'ni.   (4B:f) She stood up again.           (haka’-
                 likate’nt < ha- + ka’likate’ni she stood)
The last example illustrates the use of ha- with the active verb
stem ka’l: ‘‘to stand.’’ This same combination is frequently used
with the specialized meaning ‘‘to stop’? when a vertical subject
(8.34) is referred to. Similarly, ha- is used with the active verb
stem na’ ‘‘to lie’’ with the specialized meaning ‘‘to stop, come to
rest’? when a horizontal subject (8.34) is referred to. Examples:
           haka'liwik?aha'ni.       (421) He would not stop.
          ta’ herit?esa’huhé, hana’ ?ake'ni. (22B:c) The other boat stopped.

                             1.41     DISTRIBUTION    Consonants occur most frequently before and between vowels,
e.g., 2uya’nasite’ni “they spoke to him, it is said,’ but they also
occur after vowels and before, between, and after consonants,
e.g., ru’Stat?e “sheep,” wi'sk?ohku “robin.” While all consonants !
may occur between vowels, the occurrence of ? in this position is
less common than that of other consonants.
   Every syllable, every word, and every phrase must begin in a
single consonant. In word- or phrase-medial position clusters of
two or three (never more) consonants occur freely but the double
clusters are more common than the triple.                     In phrase-final position
not more than two consecutive consonants are permitted.","[14, 15]"
"                  1.42     MEDIAL     CONSONANT               CLUSTERS     1.421   Most instances of word- or phrase-medial double con-
sonant clusters come under one of the following rules: (1)                      ? may
be preceded by any consonant except itself, e.g., 2u’r?ut?a “if he
whoops,” ka’8?che “not true,” ¢u’h?uhki “he spat,”’ and clusters of
this type are very common.             (2) Any voiceless stop may be pre-
ceded by any continuant except y, w, or m, e.g., we’sta “sweet,”
wi'ska “gun,” ha’hka “corn,” ma’nku “four,” S2’lka “blackbird,”’
ta'rkuku “‘the tree,” the most common of such combinations being
h plus a voiceless stop, as in ha’hka. (3) Any consonant may be
preceded by n, including n itself, e.g., yu’nka “rope,” ?u’nsa
‘they are coming,” ?unna’siku “he leads them.”’
     We also find that § occurs rather often before other consonants,
as in such sporadic cases as ?a’hkisse’ma ‘‘the rest,” 2usni’y?oke
“he got lonesome,” ta’Sle “beautiful,” ?usru’ka “he is afraid,” in
addition to those instances which come under the first two rules
above. Still other types of double clusters occur but these are
likewise sporadic, e.g., 2e’k&a “pine,” ko’tyuki “hominy,” te’swayu
“her vulva,” te’rwast “claw, nail.’”’ A very rare type of cluster is
found in ro’ptini “cotton,” an abbreviated variant of ro’puhtint.
   Note also the following negative rules with reference to the
combining of consonants: (1) No consonant except n may be pre-
ceded by itself. (2) With the sole exception of ro’ptini (var. of
ro’puhtint) no voiceless stop except ? may be preceded by another
voiceless stop.
   1.422    Most cases of word- or phrase-medial triple consonant
clusters fall under one of the two following rules: (1) A permissible

 these phonemes are of rare occurrence          (see 1.21).

double cluster composed of a continuant plus a voiceless stop may
be followed by ?, e.g., ta’wiSt?eku “the Mississippi,” pi’tahk?u'na
‘he is walking.” (2) Any permissible double cluster (except one
whose prior member is n) may be preceded by n, e.g., ?2n8?e'pa
“we are happy,”           ?unsru’ka “they are afraid.”            A sporadic triple
eluster   occurs        in the    borrowed        word   ?2’ngrasa   ‘Englishman,
American” (see 1.443).

but 7, k, ?, s, y, w, and h do. not occur here. The most widely used
single final consonant is n (see 2.43, rules 4 and 5). Occurrences of
double consonant clusters in this position are also found but they
usually consist of a continuant (except y, w, or m) plus a voiceless
stop, e.g., ta’wist ha’ytht ‘on the water.”","[15, 16]"
"                     5.38     Static     Vers     STEMs
   5.381 In one instance it has been found that the thematic suffix
-hapa- (5.215) is added to an inchoativized static verb form (4.73),
viz.,
        ?uya' Sep?ake'ni.  (4B:br) he was already angry < had al-
             ready got angry; based on -ya’sepa- < -ya’s& to be angry
             + -hapa-
On the basis of this single example it is not possible to determine
whether such formations are legitimate or not. If they are, it
seems likely that they would require the verb to be of inchoative
form since -hapa- must be followed by an inflectional element.
   5.32 What remains to be said about the formation of static
verb stems is concerned with petrified or non-productive forma-
tives. We find that there are a few static verb stems beginning in
two consonants and that in most cases the first of these is § In
addition, a few of such stems appear to be related to certain active
verb stems, and, on the strength of this observation, it is assumed
that we have here an archaic prefix *-§(7)- which may at one time
have served the function of deriving static verb stems from active
verb stems. Note the following cases:
        -sni'yu- to be lonesome; possibly related to the act. verb stem
             ni'yu intr. to think
        -§pi'tu- to get lost; possibly related to pz’tu trsimp. to get lost
        -Sru’ka to be afraid, scared, frightened;         possibly related to
             ru’ka..c. tr. to frighten, scare
For other stems beginning in § plus a consonant              no connections
with active verb stems have been found.              The prefix is set up as
*.§(7)- rather than as *-§- because of such stems as -3?e’pa ‘“‘to be
happy” which may be derived from *-%- + *-?a’pa, the trace of
the 7 being preserved in the presumably assimilated vowel e. Note
also -§?e’lama ‘“‘to be helpless” which may be <*-&i- + *-?a’lama.",[73]
"                              5.5     ADJECTIVE        STEMS     Derivation is of relatively minor importance in the formation of
adjective stems, most of which are primary.                     However, a few ad-
jective stems are derived from active verb stems by implicit proc-
eSS, €.2.,
           yo'ta rotten < yo’ta to rot
           yo'la empty, abandoned, deserted < yo’la to abandon, desert

           ka'sa stripped < ko’sa to scratch, scrape, strip
           lu'pi dead < lu'pi to die  A few other adjective stems appear to be related in various
ways to active verb stems but instances of each type are rare and
none of the types is productive. One type would seem to be de-
rived by means of a suffix *-hAta, e.g.,
           li’kahta shining, shiny < li’ka to shine + *-hta
           la’mihta soft, mushy, possibly < la’mi,               which may mean to
                soften, + *-hta; la’mi occurs only               in the combination
                hu’ & + la’mi to tan hide (5.238, no. 2)
          hi'lahta happy, possibly < hi’‘la to move,                 tremble,   quiver
               + *-hta
           ri'yuhta burny, pungent, possibly < rz’yu to parch + *-htaNote also that the stem ru’kaya “dangerous” is possibly derived
from a stem *ru’ka- + a suffix *-ya, *ru’ka- probably being re-
lated to ru’ka. .c. “‘to scare, frighten” and to -sru’ka “to be scared,
frightened.”’                        5.6     PosTPosITviIONAL         STEMS                 5.61         FORMATION       OF   POSTPOSITIONS   All of the postpositions are fundamentally locative in meaning
and the majority of them are derived by means of one or the
other of two of the locative suffixes: -hta “on” and -& “‘at, to”
(4.85). Several postpositions go in pairs, that is, from one stem
are formed    two postpositions,             one with -hia, the other with -%.

                         2.41      GENERAL    REMARKS     When words occur in phrase-final position special forms known
as pause forms are employed.             Pause forms have a phrase-final
melody      on their ultima,      or, in those cases where it is permitted
(1.6), on their penultima, and many pause forms are indicated
only by means of their melody. Others, however, require some
sort of phonetic increment in addition to their melody.
   All examples of Tunica words quoted in this grammar are pause
forms when their phrase-final melody is indicated (e.g., ha’rakatt
“‘she sings’’; ta’rustaku ““Rabbit”’; ka’tan ‘“‘where’’) while examples
quoted without a melody are context forms (e.g., ha’raka’ts “‘she
sings’; ta’rustaku ‘“‘Rabbit’’; ka’ta ‘“where’’).","[30, 31]"
"                       1.3    DIscUSSION             OF    THE     VOWELS          1.31     DISTRIBUTION             AND     GENERAL        CHARACTERISTICS   Vowels occur after and between consonants but not after other
vowels. They may not initiate the syllable. Although 7, a, and u
occur freely in all positions, the remaining vowels are relatively
rare except in stressed syllables. Occurrences in word-final posi-
tion of vowels other than 2, a, or u are also rare. Moreover, vowels
in general are rare in phrase-final position for reasons that are
made clear in the section on pause forms (2.4), but when they do
occur here they are accompanied by a strong aspiration, e.g.,
lo'taku “he runs.”
   All vowels are normally short but those occurring in stressed
syllables are somewhat               lengthened, particularly if such syllables
are open. Vowels occurring before n in the same syllable are nasal-
ized, e.g., yu'nka “‘rope’’; ?z’mapan “I, too” (pause form). All
vowels are fully voiced in all positions with but one exception: In
phrase-final position an u preceded by & or hk is unvoiced in the
event that the phrase-final melody is placed on the penultimate
vowel (1.23).",[14]

 ast   depending on context, whereas English translations must be
P ade in terms of tense, the following paragraphs are designed to
elucidate the specific connotations of the Tunica categories, par-
ticularly with regard to their rendition into English.     a
   4.312      The semelfactive aspect is punctual.                     In translation it is
usually rendered by the English simple past tense, or, occasionally,
by tue past perfect tense, e.g.,
             howe'sawe'ni.        (144:}) He jumped out.
             ha’tikdn, ya’kawthé (144:k) when he had come again  4.313       The       habitual aspect is either a seriated punctual                   or a
linear aspect, i.e., it implies either that the action is habitually
performed or that it is in a state of progress. If the present tense
and the habitual aspect are contextually implied, the English
rendition may employ the simple present tense (as in “he runs
every day’’) or an expression like ‘‘do, does . . .”’ (as in “‘how do
yourun?’”). If the past tense and the habitual aspect are implied,
the English rendition may use the simple past tense (as in “‘he ran
every day’’) or an expression like ‘‘would . . .” (as in ‘‘when he
got cold he would run’’). If the present tense and the progressive
aspect are implied, the English rendition may employ the present
progressive (as in “‘he is running’’) while if the past tense and the
progressive aspect are implied, it may use the past progressive (as
in “he was running’).                  Examples:             sinsa’kuko'nt. (15:g) He eats them.
             ka’na ya’ ?éhé, sa'kukdn. (14B:r) How do you eat?

                          6.1       GENERAL       REMARKS
   Foreign influences upon Tunica, though not numerous, are re-
flected in three ways: in direct borrowings (6.2), in translation
borrowings (6.3), and in borrowed idioms, i.e., translations of
phrases of idiomatic meaning (6.4). Aside from names of tribes
and peoples, most of the direct borrowings are taken from French.
The number of such borrowings is surprisingly small considering
the long contact between the Tunica and the French. Some trans-
lation borrowings are taken from French and some from English,
1 There may be more translation borrowings from the French than I have found
 because I seldom     recorded     the French   rendition of Tunica     words   except    in
 cases where the informant had difficulty in providing an English rendition or
 where he volunteered a French rendition in addition to the English one.

exhaustive but have been selected to illustrate the types of for-
eign influences that are found.","[84, 85]"
"Contrariwise,     three other postpositions        are formed     with -& but

Of these, ha’wasi is obviously connected in some way with the pre-
verb ho- ‘‘out, out of” (9.21, no. 3); possibly ho- is a contraction
of ho’wa-.    Furthermore, the stem used in ho’tu%i is related to the
quantificative ho’tu “all” and to the active verb stem ho’tu “to
finish.”
   There now remains only one postposition, namely kz’éu “in,
into, inside of,’’ which also appears in the irregularly apocopated
atonic form kié. It is related in some way to the preverb kz- “‘in,

the connection.",[80]

consonantic     syncope,                haplology,       and   stress   losses   and         shifts.
These are discussed in detail in the following sections.
                            2.22         VOCALIC     CONTRACTION   2.221 Of the two types of situations requiring vocalic contrac-
tion the first occurs when a grammatical element ending in a
vowel is combined with a grammatical element beginning in
a vowel.    In this case the following contractions take place:
(ljite>e,             (2)     ute>o,               (3)    i, e, ore+a>e,               (4)     u or
g9+a>a,!(5)a+a>a.                            Examples:
          2e’rusa I know < %%-, 1s pref., + -e’rusa to know (1)
          20’rusa he knows < ?u-, 3ms pref., + -e’rusa (2)
          mile’nt it is red, they say 2 < mi’li red + -a’ni, quot. postf. (8)
          tasgle’nt it is beautiful < ta’sle + -a'ni (8)
          lu’pitehe'ni she did not die < lu’pitehe + -a'ni (8)
          molo'ni it is full < mo’lu + -a’ni (4)
          mo'l?oho'nt it is not full < mo’l?oha                 + -a'ni (4)
          nara’ni it is a snake < na’ra + -a’ni (5)
  2.222    In the second type of situation requiring vocalic con-
traction we find that if a suffix or postfix beginning in A plus a
vowel is attached to a polysyllabic stem ending in a vowel, the h
is lost and the vowels thus coming together contract as follows:
Qita>e2Quta>oa,B8jata>a,(4i,a,oru +1 >2.
Examples:
          ?u'wet he, on his part < ?u’wi he +°-hat on . . Os part (1)
          ta'narakot the snake, on its part < ta’naraku the snake +
               -hat (2)
          ?u'nimat we, on our part < ?u'nima we + -hat (3)
          2a'milawthé when he was about to go < ?a’mi to go + -hila-
               to be about to + -wi, 3ms endg., + -hé when (4)
          lo’tilawihé when              he was   about     to run < lta       to run + -hila-
               + -wi + -hé (4)             .
          sa'kilawihé when he was about to eat < sa’ku to eat + -hila-
               + -wt + -hé (4)
After a monosyllabic stem, on the other hand, the h is not lost and
contraction cannot occur, e.g., ma’hat ‘you, on your part”? < ma’
 you” + -hat.
                            2.23         VOCALIC     ASSIMILATION
  2.231    Of the two types of situations requiring vocalic assimi-
lation the first occurs when a suffix, postfix, or auxiliary verb be-, Instances of o + a do not happen to occur.
  To conserve space the quotative postfix, which always means ‘‘they say, it is
 Said,”’ is usually not translated in connection with the examples wherein it ap-
 pears hereinafter.
ae                                HAAS   TUNICA
ginning in ? is added to a stem or word ending in a vowel.                 In this
event the vowel following the ? assimilates to the preceding vowel
which in turn is syncopated unless it stands at the end of a mono-
syllabic stem (see 2.241).    The following assimilations occur:
(1) a after 7 or e > e€, (2) a after o or u > 9.1 Examples:            m1'l?che not red < mi’li red + -?aha not (1)
            me’ ?eki she searched < me’ to search + ?a‘ki she did (1)
            po’ ?aki she looked < po’ to look + ?a’ki (2)
            mo'l?oha not full < mo’lu full + -?aha (2)Note particularly that these assimilations occur only with suffixes,
postfixes, and auxiliary verbs. When two stems are juxtaposed,
assimilation does not occur, e.g., tina’S?am?uhke'ni (8a:a) ‘“Tak-
ing her (with him) he went (home),” wherein the stems na’& ‘‘to
take ... along’ and ?a’mi “to go” are juxtaposed without
assimilation.
   2.232 In the second type of situation requiring vocalic assimi-
lation it is found that whenever the first vowel of an aha or ehe
group changes its quality by contraction with or assimilation to a
preceding vowel, the second vowel assumes the identical quality of
the first. Examples:             te'heyaku her brother < ti-, 3Fs pref., + -a’haya sibling of the
                   opposite sex + -ku, Ms suff.
             ka’ §?ehe not true < ka’ st true + -?aha not
             29’hoyahtt his sister < ?u-, 3Ms pref., + -a’haya + -héi, Fs suff.
             la'p?oha not good < la’pu good + -?aha
             2o'hokumaku his younger brother < ?u- + -e’hekuma younger
                   brother of a man (?) 2 + -kuMoreover, in certain grammatical situations an infix is inserted
after the first vowel of an aha or ehe group without preventing the
assimilation of the second vowel, e.g., ?o’nhoyahci their sister <
?u-n-, 3MD pref.,      + -a’haya + -héi.","[19, 20, 21]"
"                                4.65      IMPERSONALS
   Impersonals may be inflected only for a 3Fs subject. This im-
plies an impersonal or nameless agent which may never be sub-
stantivally expressed within the sentence. The more important
impersonal stems are: ya’ “‘to become, get, turn; to be done, made,
formed’”’; yu’ka “to reach (e.g., a certain length of time)’; we’
“to sound”’; p2’ra ‘‘to turn, get to be”’; ho’tu ‘‘to be ended, finished ;
to come to an end, be all.’”’ Examples:
         Si’htuna ya'tthé (4a:ar) when it got dark; ya’tihé < ya’ + -tt,
              3Fs smlf. endg., + -hé, subord. postf.
         hi’na ya'kati. (41a:a) It goes like that < it is done like that;
              ya'katt < ya’ + -ka’tt, 3rs hab. endg.
         ta’'hika ta'yihkiun, yu'katthé (12:d) when seven years had passed
                < wien it reached seven years; yu'katihé < yu'ka + -tt
                + -hé
         2u'kina wi'kate’ni. (19:b) It sounded like his uncle; wi’kate'ne
              < wt’ + -ka’'ti + -a'ni, quot. postf.
         2a’ Su ma’nku     pi'ratthé (8a:c)       four days later;   (8a:b)   in four
                days < when it turned four days; p7’ratthé < pr'ra + -it
                  -hé
         ho'tukatt (41a:a) That’s all < it is finished; ho’tuka’ti < ho'tu
               + -ka’ti
   A few of the above stems are also used as intransitives, e.g.,
ya’ “‘to do, commit”’; yu’ka “‘to arrive, get there, reach one’s desti-
nation’; ho’tu ‘to finish, complete.”’                 Others, however,   may    not
be used intransitively unless they have been causativized (5.212),
e.g., wr’. .c. “to listen”; pz’ra. .c. ‘to transform oneself.”’                         4.66      TRANSIMPERSONALS
   Transimpersonals are like impersonals in that their subjective
inflection js limited to 3rs forms. In addition they must be in-
flected for pronominal object by means of the alienable pronom-
inal prefixes (4.56) though they may never take the reciprocal
prefix.   The 3rs subjective element implies an impersonal or
nameless agent which is conceived of as acting upon the pronom-
inal subject.    In some cases we find that impersonal stems are also
used as transimpersonals, e.g.,
         ka'nahk3t, heya’?akin.   (4a:u) what has happened to you?
               < what has it done to you? heya’?akin < hehk-, 2¥s pref.,

             pref., + ho’tu + ?a’ki + -a'ni
  In at least one case we have a transitive stem used as a transim-
personal and here we have what amounts to a true passive con-
struction, viz.,
        Puwe' nitistuk?oha'nt. (43B:a) he cannot be found < ?uhk-,
             3s pref., + we’nz to find + -t¢ + -stuk?oha cannot, postf.,
             + -a'ni
But in a different context this same construction could mean ‘‘she
cannot find him.”’
  In addition to the types of transimpersonals                    discussed   above
there is evidence that stems denoting involuntary action (e.g.,
“to breathe”’; ‘‘to cough’’) were formerly used as transimpersonals.
The more usual procedure now is to treat such stems as intransi-
tives. Note the following pairs of words given by the informant as
equivalents:
             Transimpersonal                           Intransitive
          the’ hakatt              or         he’hakant I am breathing
          2thk?u' hukatt           or         2u’hukant I am coughing
          2thk?o0'wikatt           or         ?0’'wikant I am sweating
          ?ule’ hukatt             or         le'hukw he is panting
In addition, there is one stem denoting an involuntary action
which is always transimpersonal, viz., hi’yu ‘“‘to wake up,” as in
thi'y?2okt (30) “I woke up.”","[57, 58]"
"               5.62     FORMATION     OF   LOCATIVE     ADVERBS
   All of the postpositions formed with the suffix -& are also used as
locative adverbs and it may be that such usage is their primary
one.    On the syntactic level they are considered postpositions
when   they govern a substantive and as adverbs                when    they are
used alone.      The following locative adverbs are such: ha’yi&t
“above’’; ha’lusi “below, beneath’ ; 2a’hkixi “behind, at the rear” ;
te'ris¢ “in front, ahead”; ha’wasi “outdoors, outside’’; ho’tuss “at
the end, edge.”
   There are a few locative adverbs based on the stem ma’yi- (cf.
the postposition ma’ythta “‘on, to the other side of; across’), viz.,
          ma'yito'ru sidewise, crosswise < ma’yi- one or the other side
               + -to’ru, meaning unknown
          ma’yisa’hku on, to one side < ma’yi- + sa’hku one
          ma’yisa’hu on, to the other side, left side < ma’yi- + sa’hu
                other
   The locative adverb ha’yigke'ra ‘backwards, on one’s back, in
Supine position” is of uncertain etymology but may contain the
adverb ha’yi& ‘‘above.” The remaining locative adverbs are dis-
cussed in sections 5.7 and 5.8.
‘ However, a confusion has arisen between the postposition ra’hpant and the ad-
 verb ra’hpan so that the latter word is also often used as a postposition.

formed by means of a prefix ?a- which is possibly related to the re-
ciprocal prefix (4.56), e.g.,
                ?ama’yisa’hku on both sides, on each side; on all sides, every
                     which way; in opposite directions, in all directions (adv.)

                ?ate'pt together, side by side (adv.) < ?a- + -te’pi, meaning
                      unknown
                ?ate'hkala in the middle of, in between (postp.); in the middle,
                      in between; evenly (adv.) < ?a- + te’hkala mid (adj.)
                ?ate'hpunt halfway; in half (adv.) < ?a- + te’hpuni half (adj.)
                ?a’sahku (perhaps read: ?asa’hku) all together, in a bunch
                     (adv.)   < ?a- + sa’/hku one   5.82         A   few   adverbs      contain   the   diminutive    suffix   -to’/hku.","[80, 81, 82]"
"On the other hand, it is equally possible to place both modifiers
either before or after the predicative word, e.g.,
        (1s) to’mahkdku,    (pm) ha’tikdn, (pM) ta’wist ha’ytht, (pw) hopi’-
             Puhke’ni.     (14a:k)    The alligator again came out on the

            He went into the woods early, it is said.
  Rule 9.   All non-locative predicate modifiers are permitted
considerable freedom as to placement. They may precede or fol-
low the independent subject, the independent object, the predica-
tive word, or a locative predicate modifier. They may stand at
the beginning of the clause (after the sentence connective) or they
may stand at the end of the clause, e.g.,
        (sc) hinya’tthé, (pm) ha’tikdén, (pw) ya'nako'ni.          (44:b) Now he
             was speaking again, it is said.

             Rabbit was speaking to him again, it is said.
        (pm) hihé (pw) ?u'k?anta'ni, (pm) ha’tikdn.          (22B:c) They settled
             there again, it is said.
   Rule 10. A predicate complement normally immediately pre-
cedes the predicative word it complements. If an adjective is used
as a predicate complement it must immediately precede the pred-
icative word unless it is modified by a comparative.                 No phrasing
is permitted between the adjective (or adjective plus its modify-
ing comparative) and the predicative word, e.g.,
        (pc) mi’li (pw) ya’kate'ni.      (368:c) It would turn red, it is said.
        (Pc) yu pahia pa'nu (pw) ya'kate’ni             (1) it gets very cold, it 15

precede the predicative word and no phrasing is permitted be-
tween the two elements, e.g.,
           (pc) lo’ta (Pw) wiwa’ndn.         (16:h) Do you want to run?
A substantive used as a predicate complement of an impersonal
verb must immediately precede the predicative word unless it is a
noun modified by a quantificative.                 Sometimes the two elements
are separated by phrasing, sometimes not, e.g.,
           (pc)    2a’ su sa’hkin, (pw) yu'katihé (4a:p)       one day < when     it
                  reached one day

                days < when it turned four days
A substantive used as a predicate complement of a transimper-
sonal active verb or of a static verb immediately precedes (or,
very rarely, immediately follows) the predicative word. Phrasing
normally separates the two elements, e.g.,
           (10) ?u’win, (Pc) ni’mdn, (Pw) 2uhpi’r2ake'ni. (9:p) He turned
                into a horned owl, it is said < it turned him into a horned
                owl, it is said.
           (pc) sa/hkuin, (pw) wiwa'nak?ihé (13:w) if you want one
           (10) ?u/win, (pw) ?uspi't?oke'ni, (pc) ti’héin. (13: an) He forgot

All of the forms except 2ms, 3Ms, and 3¥Fs are based on a stem
*ma or *-a’ma to which the inalienable pronominal prefixes are
attached, e.g., 27’ma < ?1-, Is pref., + *-ma. The stem *-a’ma
occurs only in he’ma (2Fs) and se’ma (3mpP). The dual infix of this
paradigm is -n7- in place of the -n- characteristic of the pronom-
inal prefixes, e.g., 22’nima < ?ini-, in place of ?2-n-, 1p-P pref.,
 + *ma. The forms ?u’wi (3ms) and ti’hé& (3Fs) appear to contain
their corresponding pronominal prefixes, ?u- and ti-, respectively,
but further analysis is unfruitful. The form ma’ (2ms) is anoma-
lous unless by chance it is the bare stem *(-)ma.

The du. forms appear to be related to the du. inal. prefixes except

suffix -na is replaced by a pl. suffix -é7.",[46]
"                        4.73      INCHOATIVE        FORMS   4.731  Most static verbs may also have special inchoative
forms which contain not only an inalienable prefix but also a 3Frs
subjective element, i.e., either a 3Fs inflectional ending (normally
attached to active verb stems, 4.52) or the 3rs form of the auxili-
ary verb ?u’hki (4.421). The use of one of these 3rs forms adds an
inchoative significance to the static verb complex, e.g.,
         ?uya'hpatihé    (421)    when   he   got    hungry   < ?u-,   3ms_   pref.,
               + -yavhpa to be hungry + -t, 3Frs smlf. endg., + -hé,
              subord. postf.
         Puya’ Seke’ni. (4B:r) he got angry < ?u-.+ -ya’& to be angry
               + ?a’ki, 3Fs smlf. of 2u’hki, + -a’nt, quot. postf.
         sinsto’hk?oke'nt.   (4a:ay) They got tired < si-n-, 3Fp-P pref.,
               + -sto’hku to be tired + ?a’ki + -a'ni
   4.732 Inasmuch as the inchoative forms of static verbs contain
an element which must be construed as the grammatical subject,
we have in this fact justification for our assumption that the in-
alienable pronominal prefixes function as grammatical objects
when used with static verbs (4.721). Attention should also be
called to the fact that the inchoative forms of static verbs are con-
Structed in a manner comparable to the construction of transim-
Personal active verbs (4.66). The difference between the two types -
of verbs lies in the fact that whereas transimpersonal verbs can-
hot be used without an expressed 3rs subject, most inchoative
Static verb forms have           corresponding non-inchoative forms in
Which no expressed       grammatical        subject is required.       However,
two static verb stems, -&ni’yu- “to get lonesome”              and -Spi’tu- ‘to
forget,” form exceptions to this rule. Although they may occur
Only in inchoative constructions, they are classed as static stems
Tather than as transimpersonal stems on the basis of their phonetic
Structure.    It will be noted that they begin in two consonants
62                                  HAAS   TUNICAwhereas active verb stems (including transimpersonals) invariably
begin in only one consonant. Moreover, the first consonant in
both cases is § and, as is shown later (5.32), probably represents
an archaic derivative prefix *-§(7)- which may have served the
function of converting active stems into static stems.","[60, 61]"
