"       Finally, in clauses that include an auxiliary, it is the auxiliary and not the main,lexical predicate which is fronted.(112) a. utsu       n=iriwa

       „Are you coming back?‟9.4.1.4. Short answers to polar questions       Answers to polar questions are in principle either yes or no. Example (113a),cited earlier as (109a), gives a question with a complement-taking verb „know‟ and asubordinate verb „speak.‟ A positive answer to this question could minimally consist ofthe main verb alone (114a), but it can also include the main and the subordinate clause(114b), or include the subject in between the two verbs (114c)(113) na     mɨmɨrakunia ikua kumitsa          kukama?

       A negative answer to the same question in (113), would include minimally thenegative marker tɨma (115a), tɨma plus the subject and the main verb (115b), and finally
tɨma plus the subject and both verbs (115c). Note that just tɨma plus the main verb isrejected (115d), as is an answer with ni (115e).(115) a. tɨma                                  „No‟ (ED)

9.4.2. Content questions       Content questions — also known as information questions or constituentquestions — are formed by means of interrogative words. Cross-linguistically, some ofthe strategies used to form polar questions are also attested in content questions, buttheir use seems less wide-spread. For instance, morphological marking and intonationmay be optional (König & Siemund 2007). This is the case in KK.","[571, 572, 573]"
"11.3. Selection of pronominal forms: grammar and discourse       As introduced in Chapter III, and pointed out throughout this dissertation, KKhas three sets of forms for expressing pronominal referents: long form free pronouns,short form free pronouns, and enclitics. Upon looking at them, some questions arise: dothe different forms correspond to different meanings or functions? If yes, what kinds offactors drive the choice of one form or another at the moment of the utterance? Thissection is an attempt to answer those questions by examining natural discourse.",[742]
9.4.   Interrogative sentences       Interrogative clauses are typically used for eliciting information. The languagehas two types of questions: polar questions and content questions. Polar questions arecreated by means of the second position clitic =tipa plus a word order alternation.,[565]
"
11.3.4.2.     Long forms       Long forms are used for expressing various types of focus. Following thetypology introduced in §11.1.2, we have found that long forms are employed, forexample, in information questions and answers to those questions. This would be a caseof completive focus, in which the focused information is filling a gap in the hearer‟s                                              722
knowledge. Examples (41b, 42b) are answers to the information questions presented in(41a, 42a). Strictly speaking, in (41b, 42b), either short or long forms could be used;however, a long form is preferred.(41)   a. awa=tipa ikian marawe               yaukia-ri
          who-Q      DEM fan                  do-PROG
        „Who is doing this fan‟       b. etse         yaukia-ri
          1SG.L.F        do-PROG
          „I‟m doing (it)‟(42)   a. awa-tipa    ene
          person-Q 2SG.L
         „Who is there?‟ (Lit. Who are you?)       b. etse
          1SG.L.F
          „(It‟s) me‟       Another example of completive focus using a long form pronoun is presented in(43). The speaker is describing the day that the teacher arrived in the community. Aboat was approaching the village but it was not yet close enough to identify who wascoming. The interaction of some community members in this particular context ispresented in (43). First they started guessing (43a-b). After one of them identified whothe person was, he made a strong assertion using (43c), where he uses the third personsingular long form uri to refer to the person in question.(43)   a. wepe awa        uri-ari,
          one  person     come-PROG
        „Somebody is coming‟       b. ikua-ta-wara-taka        uri-ari,
         know-CAU-DER-MOD          come-PROG
        „Maybe the teacher is coming‟                                           723
       c. uri          uri-ari
          3SG.L.M come-PROG
         „[Yes], he [is the one that] is coming‟       However, in some questions, the missing information is not always the onlypiece in focus. The sequence of examples in (44) comes from a story about a man whois looking for his girlfriend in the darkness of the night. At some point, he starts callingher:(44)   a. maka=tip(a)=ene, waina=kɨra
          Where=Q=2SG.L, woman=DIM
         „Where are you, little woman?‟       b. ajan=ka    etse
          DEM=LOC 1SG.L.F
         „Here I am‟       Note that in (44a) the second person long form appears attached to theinterrogative word, and this is the only form allowed there. Interestingly, in (44a) themissing information is the location. However, the answer has multiple foci, „where‟ and„who.‟ In (44b), the location appears in sentential position and the located person isexpressed by the long form.","[751, 752, 753]"
Typical examples of this subtype of focus are answers to information questions (e.g.,[703]
"        KK has five vowels, but the apparent fact that three out of the five vowels arelocated in the front area deviates from the above predictions. Then, the question is,would an acoustic study confirm that three phonemes are in fact placed in a small areaof the vowel space? If this is the case, why would a language exhibit such overlap? The

        In the following paragraphs I describe in some detail polar questions (§9.4.1)and content questions (§9.4.2).,[566]
"9.4.1. Polar questions        Polar question are typically employed to inquire about the truth or falsity of theproposition they express often with focus on one specific part of the proposition (Givón2001). Cross-linguistically, six strategies to encode polar questions have been found.",[566]
"9.4.1.1.   The morpheme =tipa       Polar questions are primarily formed by adding the morpheme =tipa at the endof the questioned element. Every element in the clause can be interrogated by means of=tipa, but the questioned piece of information must occur in first position in the clause.",[567]
"       To close this section, it is possible to say that the most productive devices forinterrogation in KK are the morpheme =tipa and interrogative pronouns. In theory,every piece of information contained in a sentence can be interrogated by simplyplacing it in sentence-initial position and marking it with =tipa. Content questions areformed by means of interrogative pronouns which must appear fronted; =tipa is optionalin this type of question. KK has a small set of interrogative pronouns; however, on thebasis of this small set many others can be derived by means of postpositions and
                                               546
subordinators. Intonation alone and subject-verb inversion are less productivemechanism for forming questions.","[575, 576]"
"This sentence would be used to ask someone to come back; here the return of the personis expected, so the question is not whether, but when it might happen.(21)   a. mania-puka       n=iriw=utsu

"In both polar questions and information questions this morpheme appears appended tothe first element in the clause. The examples below demonstrate that polar interrogative

"       Faust (1972:88) claims that Kokama has a third type of interrogativeconstruction: indirect questions. Faust indicates that, in addition to =tipa, Kokama hasthree other interrogative suffixes, -taku,-raku and -nda, which she says are employed tocreate indirect questions. Cabral (1995:216, 351) echoes this claim. Here are theexamples provided by Faust (1972:88). The orthographic adaptation, glossing andtranslation are mine.

          „Maybe that one is your mother‟
         (Tal vez ésa es tu mamá. ¿Es ésa, tal vez, tu mamá?)        According to my analysis, examples (102a-c) are in fact questions. They arecontent questions, not because of the suffixes -nda, -raku, or -taku but rather becausethey involve the interrogative pronoun awa „who.‟ Contrast these with Faust‟s example(102d), which does not include an interrogative pronoun, and whose primaryinterpretation is hence not that of a question but a weak statement (see §9.4.2 for adiscussion of content questions). As for the markers themselves, -taku (=taka, in thisvariety) indicates uncertain modality (see §9.1.2.1.4). The forms -raku and -nda are notattested in the database for this study. In conclusion, in this variety, only =tipa operatesas an interrogative marker.","[565, 566]"
"       In the examples in (103), the piece of information being questioned is thepredicate. Note that the verb occurs in first position and then is marked by =tipa.

"Every instance with =taka is translated into Spanish with tal vez, quizá „maybe,perhaps.‟ In previous analyses of the language, the uncertainty marker —cited as taku—has been described as a suffix used to formulate indirect questions (Faust, 1972:88), or aparticle to form rhetorical questions (Cabral 1995:216). In the database for this study,neither use was confirmed.",[525]
Information questions are formed by means of interrogative pronouns.,[565]
"       The functional load of the future markers is further demonstrated in the elicitedsentences in (21). Note that the sentence with a straight forward future interpretation is(21a), with the form =utsu. The speaker explains that he would ask this question to aperson that is leaving the village in order to know when s/he is coming back.

The context given for this example was this:one guy and his mother have an accident and someone asks: have they died? Theanswer to this question would be (25), where the first clause is a negative statement, andthe second a positive one.

"      However, what is basic and how to identify it remains debatable. None of thestandard strategies to detect basic word order — statistical frequency, descriptivesimplicity, and pragmatic neutrality —is without problems. As a result, some scholarshave questioned the universality of the very notion of basic word order; when languagesdisplay several order patterns, instead of asking “what is the basic order”, some scholarsadvocate asking a different question, namely “what is the communicative function ofone order, rather than another” (Mithun 1992, Payne 1990, 1992). Thus, the firsttypological division should be made between those languages in which word orderprimarily correlates with grammatical factors, and those in which word order primarilycorrelates with pragmatic factors (Thompson 1978).",[759]

       Generally, =pura occurs appended to the last word of a constituent or phrase(e.g., 3a-d). On nouns, however, =pura exhibits an odd distribution because it occupiesa slot position close to the root. That is, it shows up between derivational morphemesand the evaluative morphemes, as shown in the following examples:(4) tsuwɨ=pura                  blood=FOC           „the blood‟

"Applying Croft‟s categories, it is possible to say that in a number of tokens it has adefinite interpretation. The question then is where the definite interpretation comesfrom. Because of this discovery, each of the 38 give scenarios was further examined. Itwas found that the R can be inferred from other pieces of the sentences, such as: i) asthe possessor of the object; ii) as an argument of a relative clause modifying the object;and, iii) as an argument of an adverbial clause. The results are summarized in Table 9.8,followed by examples that illustrate each category.",[554]
"As Lambrecht puts it, information structure is concerned with psychological phenomenasuch as the speaker‟s hypotheses about the hearer‟s mental states “only inasmuch asthey are reflected in grammatical structure.” (1994:3). It should be pointed out thatinformation structure differs from (conversational) pragmatics, in that the latter isconcerned with the interpretations of sentences that emerge from conversationalsettings. That is to say, “while conversational pragmatics is concerned with thequestion of why one and the same sentence form may express two or more meanings,discourse pragmatics is concerned with the question of why one and the same[propositional] meaning may be expressed by two or more sentence forms.” (Lambrecht1994:5). A basic claim of information structure is then that different constructions thatseem to be describing the “same” scene in a single language express different ways ofconceptualizing that scene. That is, different constructions appear to have a differentconceptual content (cf. also Croft 1993).",[698]
"         The example in (110) comes from a text. It includes the word tupa which, in thatsyntactic position, operates as a noun with the meaning „place.‟14 However, with theappropriate intonation and in the appropriate context it is interpreted as a question.(110) inu    yanuka          tupa=ka
      3PL.F put              place=LOC
      „They put it in (what) place?‟9.4.1.3.    Subject-verb inversion         An additional strategy to indicate polar questions is a combination of inversionof the subject and the verb plus ascendant intonation. We have seen already that inquestions with =tipa, the piece under interrogation must be fronted. Subject-verbinversion is different in that the verb is fronted, but not marked by =tipa. The elicitedexamples in (111a-c), cited earlier as (22a-c), illustrate this pattern. This strategy is notproductive in texts.(111) a. uri=n=á          kamutun
         come=2SG-FUT2 tomorrow
        „Will you come tomorrow?‟

          „Do you want to come tomorrow?‟ (ED)
           (Lit. „Want you come tomorrow?‟)14
   When tupa appears fronted in a clause it operates as interrogative pronoun „where‟; when it attaches to
a subordinated verb it functions as a relativizer of locative obliques. See Chapter X.",[570]

with respect to the verb (Hawkins 1983, Dryer 1992, among others). This has constituteda way of categorizing languages in typology. However, what is basic in terms of orderand how to identify it remains debatable. As a consequence, some scholars havesuggested that the first typological division should be made between those languages inwhich word order primarily correlates with pragmatic factors, and those in which orderprimarily correlates with grammatical factors (Thompson 1978). Thus, in languageswhich display several order patterns, instead of asking “what is the basic order”, it shouldbe asked “what is the communicative function of one order, rather than another” (Payne1990, 1992). In order to answer this question, explanatory factors beyond syntax, such asinformation structure and pragmatics, must be taken into consideration. The case ofKokama-Kokamilla is interesting because both grammatical relations and pragmatics playa prominent role in the distribution of the different order patterns.","[73, 74]"

However, what triggers the speaker‟s choice seems to be too subtle tohave been adequately captured at this point in the analysis.",[659]
"       However, the amount and kind of evidence needed to argue for the existence ofgrammatical relations seems controversial. For instance, for Comrie, “a number oflogically independent criteria must be established that serve to identify the grammaticalrelation in question as being syntactically significant in the language in question”(Comrie 1991:66). However, Van Valin (2002:205) argues that “there are purelysyntactic grammatical relations in a language if there is at least one construction with arestricted neutralization of semantic and pragmatic relations for syntactic purposes.”",[84]

apprehensive modality (Dixon 1977, Aikhenvald 2003), timitive mood (Palmer 2001), admonitive mood
(Meira 1999), etc. The syntactic scope for apprehensive modality markers could be independent clauses,
subordinate clauses, and noun phrases. To my knowledge, questions bearing apprehensive epistemic have
not yet been reported in typological works.",[533]

"       As for the Tupian origin of the KK people, there is a consensus amonganthropologists and historians alike that the KK and Omaguas living in Peru aredescendents of the Tupí ethnic group. As been pointed out by Lathtrap 1970, Chaumeil1981, and Rivas 2000, among many others, the early chonicles clearly report themigration of Tupí groups from Eastern Brazil towards the Western Amazon centuriesprior to the arrival of Spanish explorers. That is, prior Tupian presence in the region is                                                753
out of the question. However, the fact that the main vocabulary of KK is of Tupí originclearly shows that a Tupían language was crucially involved in the genesis of thelanguage.","[782, 783]"
"However, the quantifier can be nominalized, and thereby become the head noun itself(141c); again, this phenomenon seems parallel to the Spanish expression unos cuantos„a few.‟(141) a. awɨ rɨ     kumitsa=kɨ ra=nan              ya=kumitsa

  An example would be the rhetorical question: Cuántos hijos quizás tendrá? „How many kids might he
have?‟ which implies this person has many kids.",[300]

        The semantics of =era is somehow complex. It not only indicates that the eventexpressed in the utterance is non-factual but also involves what Lichtenberck(1995:293) calls an apprehensional-epistemic, a mixture of epistemic and attitudinalmeanings having to do with “the speaker‟s degree of certainty about the factual status ofa proposition and with his or her attitude concerning the desirability of the situationencoded in the clause.” To be more precise, =era signals that the situation is not onlyuncertain but in some way undesirable, which makes the speaker nervous, or“apprehensive.”6        In the text database, the morpheme =era appears primarily in questions, morerarely in declarative sentences. In their discourse context, these are in fact rhetoricalquestions; they are not used with the expectation of eliciting a piece of information, butto express a speculative comment about inexplicable, enigmatic events that involve fear.","[532, 533]"
