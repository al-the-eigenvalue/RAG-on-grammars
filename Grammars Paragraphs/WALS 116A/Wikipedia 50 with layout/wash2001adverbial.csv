"Though all three cleft constructions consist of an NP followed by a
nominalized clause, in only one of the cleft constructions does the nominalized
clause have the same form as typical, nominalized relative clauses in
Barbareno. I refer to these three kinds of clefts in the following way: i) true
clefts; ii) pseudo clefts; and iii) hi clefts. True clefts and pseudo clefts have
nominalized clauses that begin with the stative clitic ka=; hi clefts have
nominalized clauses that begin with the focus clitic hi= (not to be confused
with the dependent clitic hi=). These cleft constructions are illustrated in turn.e True clefts
       In true cleft constructions, the clefted NP either has the stative prefix
2al-, as seen in (282) and (283) below, or it has the predicating particle
?akay (glossed 'cLeFrr'), as seen in (284). In both cases the clefted NP is
followed by a nominalized clause that has the stative proclitic ka=.(282)          sathip        2alhé?iel-2elyewu*-h

clefts. In pseudo clefts, the clefted NP is ""bare"" in the sense that it does not
have the stative prefix 2a1-, nor is it preceded by the predicating particle
?akay. Also, pseudo clefts are much more frequent in the corpus than true
clefts. Two illustrations of a pseudo cleft are given in (285) and (286). (For

two or more referents. In (287) the clefted NP            ‘a fox' is an alternative
referant to the NP     'a coyote' in the line above it.      _(287)   sAihip         wa‘yi hinasi-won                   ilagka2

main clause. It continues tracking the referent Lucrecia, first introduced in line
b. The temporal clause has to be postposed because, if it were preposed, the
third person subject prefix s- (in the temporal clause) would be referring to
Florentino, the topicalized NP in line a., instead of Lucrecia, the object NP in
line b. (It will be recalled that pronouns in Chumash languages do not
distinguish gender.) Thus if the order of the adverbial clause were changed,
the meaning would change to:

nature of the conditional relation. The main clause also has another irrealis
operator in the form of the particle kimini 'if so; in that case; then', which
only occurs in conditional relations.",[243]

was something that could be self-evident to anybody, i.e. something that could
be treated as a matter of course in the real world. Or, they could treat the
terminal event as one whose occurrence was subjective--subject to the opinion
or judgment of someone else. For narratives, the opinion or judgment in
question is that of the narrator or that of a protagonist within the story.",[150]
"12.2 Non-adverbial Gukanu clauses
         There are several non-adverbial clauses that have the Gukanu
conjunction. To a certain extent, these non-adverbial clauses reflect the
patterns of subject marking that we have seen in the adverbial Gukanu
clauses. In the non-adverbial clauses, the conjunction translates variously as
 ‘so that; and so; such that; that is why'. Unlike the adverbial clauses, non-
adverbial Gukanu clauses with the same subject as the preceding clause
always retain the subject pronoun. For example, in (26), the same subject is
indexed on the verbs with the second person subject pronoun p-. The
éukanu conjunction in question happens to have scope over two clauses (lines
c. and d.).",[306]
"1.9.2.3 Conditional relations
       Generally, an adverbial clause that provides the condition(s) under
which the event/state in the main clause occurs is analyzed in this dissertation
as a conditional clause. However, as discussed earlier, conditional relations can
be conflated with temporal relations in Barbareno, with the result that the
clause in question may not be a true conditional clause, even if it has an
adverbial conjunction that Harrington translates as ‘if’. In identifying a                                                 21
conditional clause, then, I looked for the following factors: (i) the adverbial
clause must code a hypothetical, i.e. unreal, situation; and, (ii) the main clause
must have one or more of the following features (following Givén 1990:829)
all of which underscore the irrealis nature of conditional constructions: the
modal verb uniyiw ‘to be necessary, to have to, should', the modal verb
alaqway      ‘can, to be able', the future tense prefix sa?-, the modal particle
may ‘would, should', a marker of certainty such as the particle pa ‘must be,
must have', the hortative particle kuhhe 'let it not be (that)', the particle
kimini 'then (in that case)', an imperative verb, an indirect request, or a
question. Negation in the main clause was another criterion I considered, since
in some languages all clauses that have negation are treated as irrealis (T.
Payne 1997). I decided not to treat negation as one of the structural criteria
in the identification of a conditional relation. However, in those cases where
I gave a conditional interpretation based on a pragmatic interpretation of the
context, i.e. where none of the above structural criteria were found in the
associated main clause, it was almost always the case that the main clause had
negation. These judgment calls were rare, however.
        Following Givén (1990:831) a counterfactual conditional relation was
identified as one in which: (i) the adverbial clause has a firm and negative
truth-value; (ii) the adverbial clause has a realis operator such as the past
tense suffix -wa5; and finally, (iii) the main clause has an irrealis operator
such as future tense or a modal particle. Counterfactual clauses are rare in my
corpus, however.
        The passage below has several conditional clauses: a conditional na
clause (line a.), a conditional haku clause (line c.), and a counterfactual
conditional haku clause (line f.).","[43, 44]"
"23.2.1 Referent tracking
        Most neutral clauses occur in final position for reasons that have to do
with the demands of referent tracking. There are two prominent patterns in
the data, these are explored in 23.2.1.1 and 23.2.1.2 respectively. In the first
pattern, the main clause predicates something about a referent expressed in
the immediately preceding material. The main clause provides a comment or
an evaluation, while the neutral clause provides further information about the
meaning of the proposition in the main clause. In most instances, the referent
in question is a statement about habitually-occurring events, past or present.
In the second pattern, the main clause introduces a full NP whose referent has
a role as a Given core argument in the neutral clause. Both scenarios allow
for easier cognitive processing, in that the main clause and the adverbial
clause immediately follow the material which is most relevant to the meanings
of their propositions, and about which they comment on further.",[560]

        Thompson and Longacre (1985:198-199) state that there are two kinds
of concessive adverbial clauses: definite and indefinite. Definite concessive
clauses have a concessive conjunction like English ""although ' or Barbareno
Chumash ?iyeme. The indefinite concessive clauses typically contain an
indefinite pronoun or question word, such as 'whoever', 'what', or 'how',
as in 'No matter what he said, she still refused to go out with him' or
 ""Whoever he is, ’m not opening the door’ (1985:199). The example in (2)
above illustrates both the qualities of definite and indefinite concessive
clauses: it has the conjunction ?iyeme, and at the same time it has the
indefinite question word 2akay ‘how much'. None of the Barbareho
Chumash concessive clauses were found to have indefinite elements without
the conjunction 2iyeme.10.2 2iyeme clauses that code concessive conditional relations
         Several tokens of the 2? iyeme clause type code a concessive conditional
relation. Concessive conditional clauses are often referred to as ‘even if'
clauses (Thompson       and Longacre       1985, Givén 1990), as in the English
sentence ‘Even if it rains we'll have our picnic' (from Thompson and
Longacre 1985:196). Crosslinguistically, these clauses are similar to the regular
conditional clauses in a given language, but they carry a contrary-to-
expectation presupposition not normally found in the ordinary conditional
clauses for that language (Thompson and Longacre 1985). In Barbareno
Chumash, a concessive conditional clause has the conjunction 2iyewhe
 ‘although, though; even if"". (Cf. however example (8) in chapter 8, where the
adverbial clause has the conjunction 2iyena ‘if’, which leans toward a
concessive conditional meaning.) Also, it may be followed by the conjunction
haku 'if' or na ‘if in the same adverbial clause. The main clause may have
markers of irrealis modality, such as the future prefix sa2-, that underscore
the hypothetical nature of the conditional relation. An example is given in (3).
The concessive conditional clause in line b. also happens to be in medial
position. It appears to be in a dependent relation with the main clause
preceding it and the main clause following it.","[255, 256]"

lines b. and d. The overlap in question involves the verb 'to open' and the
noun 'the door’. In line b. we see that Luisa never opened her door to
strangers, but in line c. we see that, under certain conditions,     she quickly
opened the door. The conditional clause in line c. introduces the hypothetical
scenario that is essential in establishing the contrast between the propositions
preceding it and following it. The contrast is further underscored by the
conjunction 2ik®u ‘but! and the emphatic particle ine in the conditional

above, unlike what we saw for conditional clauses that explore options,
establish contrasts and repeat claims. The exemplification of a generalization
does not necessarily have to involve lexical overlap, as it often must for the
previous three tasks. However, lexical overlap plays a role in those conditional
clauses that do the fourth task (exemplifying), if the generalization in question
is being exemplified by two or more conditional clauses. When this happens
one sees a parallel structure among the conditional clauses that do the task
of exemplifying. For example, in (17), the excerpt begins with Mary Yee
stating the generalization that the Chumash and the Spanish (of more olden
times) were very superstitious people (lines a. - d.). She focuses on the
Spanish (lines e. and f.), and gives four examples of their superstitions (lines
g. - n.). Conditional clauses introduce the superstitions in turn.","[461, 462]"

There is no specific morphology that indicates a simultaneous temporal

happens to the wooden bowl, as a matter of course, after the coating of lard
has been applied. A conditional interpretation is therefore not possible with
the wa clause above. Only a temporal interpretation is acceptable.
Interestingly, in this same narrative there are some elicited clauses that are
near-minimal pairs of those occurring in the text, and in one of these, a mali
 ‘'when' conjunction was used instead of a wa conjunction. The meaning
appears to be the same. The mali 'when' clause in question occurs in (3)

"Their main function is that of qualifying the meaning of the main clause
proposition. These two factors alone, i.e. i) that the adverbial clause does not
have a global role in structuring the discourse and ii) that the adverbial clause
serves mainly in the localized role of qualifying the meaning of the main
clause, are often enough motivation for the adverbial clause to assume a
postposed position. In this sense, the postposed position is the default position
for adverbial clauses. (Since topics and themes come first rather than last, in
the order of topic-comment and theme-rheme, the adverbial clause that is not
serving in a topic-like or theme-like capacity, ie. as a point of orientation,
would most likely be postposed.) There are, however, other factors that
increase the probability of an adverbial clause appearing postposed instead of
preposed: i) referent tracking; ii) an embedded main clause; iii) a main clause
that already has preposed material, such as a topicalized NP or a preposed
adverbial clause; iv) the adverbial clause has the additional function of an
afterthought or reminder; v) the adverbial clause is part of a routinized
construction in which the adverbial clause is always in final position; and
finally, specific to temporal clauses, vi) the adverbial clause codes a terminal
temporal boundary.
         For some of these factors, to understand why they increase the
likelihood that an adverbial clause will be postposed it is helpful to look to the
theory of information flow (Chafe 1976, 1987, 1992, 1994), the principle of
least effort (Zipf 1935) and iconic motivation in language (Haiman 1983), all
of which are interrelated. Considering first the factor of referent tracking, we
saw that an adverbial clause tends to be final if it is tracking a referent that
was introduced (or re-introduced) into the discourse context as a full NP in
the associated main clause. The full NP has New information status in the
main clause, as it is being activated or re-activated in the listener’s
consciousness. In the postposed adverbial clause, the NP acquires Given
status, as it is then already activated in the listener’s consciousness, and the
referent is indexed as a pronominal affix instead of as a full NP. A reversal of
the clausal order would in many cases lead to ambiguity in meaning, as it
would not in all cases be clear who or what was being referred to, by the
pronominal affix, if the adverbial clause were preposed.
        Other factors underscore the importance of conceptual relevance and
(hence) iconic motivation in the ordering of clauses. A clause is more likely                                              553
to be contiguous to the clause whose meaning it qualifies or completes. Thus
in all cases where the main clause was embedded, the adverbial clause was
never preposed. If the main clause in question was a complement clause, the
adverbial ciause did not come between it and its matrix verb. If the main
clause in question was a relative clause, the adverbial clause did not come
between it and its head NP in the matrix clause. In the former case, it would
be infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the matrix verb
and complement clause, because the complement clause completes the
meaning imparted by the matrix verb, while the adverbial clause adds further
information about the complement clause. In the latter case, it would be
infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the head NP and
relative clause, because the relative clause provides information that is directly
relevant to the head NP, while the adverbial clause provides information that
is directly relevant to the relative clause. The clausal orders are iconically
motivated in that the clauses most conceptually relevant to each other are
always positioned next to each other. Such iconically motivated clausal orders
should require the least cognitive effort in processing information about the
events and states named by the clauses in question.
        Iconic motivation also has a crucial role in the factor specific to
temporal clauses: in the corpus, temporal clauses that code terminal
boundaries tend to be postposed rather than preposed. The motivation is
iconic in that terminal-boundary temporal clauses code events that happen last
in a given series of events. Hence, the clauses that code them tend to be last
in a given series of clauses. The only exceptions are those that also perform
as pivotal points of orientation, making reference to a prior event and also
providing a context in which a succeeding event occurs. In such cases there is
a competing motivation: terminal events are last in a given series of events
and hence should be coded by final clauses, but pivotal points of orientation
need to be coded first in a given a series of clauses, because they provide
crucial, contextualizing information for the following event(s) or situation(s).
In such cases, the latter motivation takes precedence. So the terminal-
boundary temporal clause, which would otherwise be postposed, has to be
preposed in those cases.
        Adverbial clauses also tend to be final when the associated main clause
already has preposed, associated material, such as a topicalized NP or another
adverbial clause. This preposed, associated material is already doing the task
of setting a scene or otherwise breaking the discourse into thematically-
coherent chunks. It is not necessary (or perhaps even possible) for the
adverbial clause in question to assume that role, so it assumes the postposed                                       354
position. Another possible reason that the adverbial clause is final, in such
cases, is that it might too much of a cognitive burden to have so much
pragmatically-marked material preposed to the main clause, especially in a
      initio! language Uke Darhasohn Chumas
       Finally, adverbial clauses that serve as reminders or afterthoughts are
always final. The order is again iconically motivated in that reminders and
afterthoughts are comments on events and situations that were mentioned in
the preceding context, and the clausal order reflects this by the fact that
reminders and afterthoughts are coded by final clauses.","[575, 576, 577]"

          Examples with four lines begin with a transliteration of Harrington’s
  phonetic transcription. I include a hyphen in the phonetic line if it appears to
  me that Harrington was using it as part of his phonetic transcription;
  otherwise, it is left out. The ways in which these kinds of hyphens can be
  distinguished in Harrington’s notes are discussed in Wash 1997.
          The second line shows the morphemes and morphological boundaries,

  A hyphen (-) follows affixes. Finally, a plus sign (+) indicates that the affix in
  question is lexically fused to the rest of the stem.
          The third line gives glosses. (See the List of Abbreviations page.)
          The fourth line gives a free translation. On many occasions Harrington
  provided only a partial translation or no translation at all for a given line of
  text. Apparently this was to save time. Harrington worked with three
  generations of people who spoke the Barbareho language. He could speak
  Barbareho and apparently understood just about everything Mary Yee said

texts used in my database, his free translations are usually not line-by-line
translations. Rather, the translations, when given, appear at the end of a text

     clauses with respect to level of expectation and likelihood
        As has been pointed out by Thompson & Longacre (1985:193), Givén
(1990:830, 832-833), and Comrie (1986), many languages code distinctions in
conditional and time clauses, distinctions that have to do with the speaker’s
level of expectation about the possibility or hypotheticality of the event in
question. For example, Thompson and Longacre (1985:193) state that the
difference between the English sentences 'If he comes, you will see him' and
                                              205
 ""When he comes, you will see him' is that the latter, 'when he comes"",
codes a higher level of likelihood or expectation that the event 'he comes'
will occur. Thus with the English conjunction 'when', the speaker has a
higher expectation that he will come; with ‘if’, the speaker     Fe
                                                                    has

expectation that he will come.
         Like English and many other languages, Barbareno Chumash codes the
speaker’s level of expectation via the choice of an adverbial conjunction. This
is particularly clear for three of the adverbial conjunctions: mali 'when', na
 ‘if; when' and haku ‘if; whether'. The schematic in Figure 3 shows where
these conjunctions stand, relative to each other, on a scale of expectation,
likelihood, and hypotheticality.              haku    ‘if!          na   ‘if; when'       mali     ‘when!","[227, 228]"

7.0 Introduction
         There are 23 tokens of adverbial clauses that have the conjunction
haku 'if; whether’. This conjunction has also been found to occur with two
other adverbial conjunctions as the second member in a complex conjunction:
the manner conjunction kaheé 'like, as if' and the concessive conjunction
?iyeme 'though, although; even if'. Ineseho Chumash also has the haku
conjunction with the meaning 'if'. This conjunction is probably related to the
general connective *ha, which still occurred in Ineseno but not in Barbareho
during the time of Harrington’s field work, and the adverbial conjunction ku
 ""lest; so that..not...'. One word known to be based partly upon the haku
 ‘if’ conjunction is kKehaku 'or', derived from the conjunction ke 'and' and
haku 'if'.
         Adverbial clauses of the haku ‘if' type appear in initial and final
positions: 15 are preposed, 8 are postposed. These adverbial clauses either
code a conditional relation with a main clause or a relation that is semantically
neutral with respect to conditionality or time.7.1 haku ‘if’ clauses that code conditional relations
       In a conditional relation, the event or state named by the adverbial
clause provides the condition(s) under which the event or state named by the
main   clause   can occur.   In such relations, the adverbial   clause   denotes   a
hypothetical or unreal situation, and the main clause will typically have certain
lexical items and morphosyntax that further point to the irrealis nature of the
conditional relation (Givén 1990). For example, in Barbareno Chumash the
main clause may have a modal verb such as uniyiw 'to be necessary, to have
to, should' or alaqway 'can, be able, be possible', the future tense prefix
sa2-, the modal particle may 'would; should; might', the hortative particle
kume   'let it not be (that)...', a marker of certainty such as the particle pa
 ‘must be, must have, probably, likely' or kalpas ‘surely, certainly', the
particle kimini 'then (in that case)', an imperative verb, an indirect
request, or a main clause verb that is itself a question (Givén 1990). Some
examples of these features in haku 'if' conditional clause constructions will
be illustrated throughout this section.","[197, 198]"

tense-aspect marking in the adverbial clause, the adverbial clause conjunction
is not semantically specific, and there is no lexical item within the adverbial
that indicates a time frame, a temporal interpretation of the adverbial clause
is still possible if the pragmatics of the context demands it. In these cases, I
also apply a process of elimination by seeing, for example, if the adverbial
clause makes just as much sense with a conditional interpretation, or a reason
interpretation, etc. In (4) and (5) there are two adverbial clauses from the
same procedural text, both of which happen to be minimal pairs. The version
in (4) appears to be a constructed sentence. The two adverbial conjunctions
in question, mali 'when' ((4) line d.) and wa ‘if; when' ((5) line c.) are
semantically non-specific. Both adverbial clauses have a temporal
interpretation in this context, however, because the context does not permit
any other interpretation.","[40, 41]"

23.1.4 Exemplifying a preceding generalization
        Like conditional and temporal clauses, neutral clauses may also develop
a discourse by introducing examples to illustrate a preceding generalization.
Only 9% of the neutral clause tokens perform this function, however. Four
examples of these neutral clauses are seen in the following two narrative
excerpts. In (13), the neutral clauses in question appear in lines b. and f. They
introduce examples of the generalization given in line a., that old men are
always talking lies.","[548, 549]"

"       Exploring options and alternatives is the most common function that
Barbareno Chumash conditional clauses were found to have in my corpus:
Out of the 76 preposed tokens, 31 (41%) have this role. Example (3) presents
an entire text about the kinds of animals one could have for a spirit helper or
talisman, referred to as 2atiSwin in the Barbareno Chumash language. The
structure of this narrative is centered around the choices of animals that one
could have for an 2atiSwin. The preferred choice (Prairie Falcon) is coded
by a superlative clause in line b. Four alternatives are then offered in lines d.
(Snake), g. (Skunk), k. (Rabbit) and n. (Bear). Each alternative is coded by
ana ‘if’ conditional clause. These conditionals have an unusual predicate
nominal form, of which more will be said later.",[447]
" 22.2.1 Coding terminal temporal boundaries
        In Barbareho Chumash narratives, temporal clauses tend to be final if
. they code an event that is the final step in a given process. Exceptions to this
  generalization occur only if the temporal clause is, at the same time, creating
  a link with a previous event, as through recapitulation. In such cases, then, a
  temporal clause that codes a terminal boundary will be preposed, instead of
  postposed. As discussed in chapters 4 and 6, Barbareho Chumash codes both
  kinds of terminal-boundary temporal clauses with different adverbial
  conjunctions: final temporal clauses that code terminal temporal boundaries
  always have the adverbial conjunction 2akay hu 'until', but initial temporal
  clauses that code terminal temporal boundaries always have the adverbial
 conjunction mali 'when'.
         Three examples of temporal clauses that code terminal boundaries are
 given below. (See also chapters 4 and 6 for a detailed treatment of the
 semantic and morphosyntactic properties of such clauses.) The excerpts in (25)
 and (26) illustrate prototypical, final temporal clauses that code terminal
 boundaries. The excerpt in (27) shows a preposed clause that codes this kind
 of temporal relation.
         The excerpt in (25) is from a procedural text about making posoli. The
 temporal clause in question occurs in line e. It names an event in which the
_Skins of the ears of corn finally all come off. This event is the point at which
 the main clause action of rubbing the skins (line d.) ceases to occur.",[514]
"15.1.1 Kinds of causal/reason relations
        A subtle but important semantic distinction between mehu and kayké
 ""because' clauses concerns the kinds of causal/reason relations that the
adverbial clause codes, and the degree to which the causal relations are
treated as being self-evident. ehu reason clauses only code fact-based causal
relations, where there is a direct, causal relation between event X and event
Y. They do not code motivations for speech acts, as kayké clauses do, nor do
they code causal relations that are not self-evident or which can only be
inferred with particular evidence or information. Verbs in mehu reason clauses
almost always denote a state of being of the subject in question. This state of
being then becomes the source or cause for the state of affairs named in the
corresponding main clause. Importantly, the cause/reason is not one that is
consciously intended (i.e. not consciously intended by the mehu-clause
subject). Likewise, the event or action in the corresponding main clause is not
something that the main-clause subject intentionally plans. Thus as we saw in
(1), the people’s state of being respectable is the reason their behavior does
not include breaking into other people’s houses. In (2), the man’s physical
state of being--i.e. his suffering--is what caused him to tremble a lot. In (3) d.,
the mehu clause predicate is a collocation meaning 'to be glad in spirit, to be
happy’. That state of being is the reason for the state of affairs in the
corresponding main clauses in lines b. and c.",[337]
"1.6 Literature review
       Taken as a whole, the literature on adverbial clauses is immense. This
topic has been written about from vastly different perspectives not only within
linguistics, but within other fields of learning such as philosophy. As discussed
in section 1.8, my data on Barbareno adverbial clauses occur within narrative
discourse. Most of the vast literature on adverbial clauses, however, deals with
constructed data. I am particularly interested in studies that examine adverbial
clauses within a discourse context, such as monologic narrative or
conversation, because such studies focus on questions and issues that are most
relevant to a functionally-oriented perspective on language. The following are
some of the sources that inform my descriptions and analyses of adverbial
clauses in Barbarefo, though these of course are not the whole extent of my
references to the adverbial clause literature in the dissertation: Haiman 1978,
Chafe 1984, Thompson 1985, Thompson and Longacre 1985, Ford and
Thompson 1986, Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990, and Ford
1993,
        Some of the sources mentioned above give an overview of adverbial
clauses from a functional and cross-linguistic perspective. Givén (1990)
discusses adverbial clauses in his chapter on interclausal coherence. First he                                         6
gives a typology of adverbial clauses by semantic category, i.e. temporal,
conditional, cause and reason, concessive, substitutive, additive, and purposive.
Following that is a discussion about participial adverbial clauses, which are a
type of adverbial clause that does not have a specific semantic relation.
Finally, he discusses the functions that adverbial clauses are known to have in
the coherence and grounding of discourse, with a specific focus on the
differences between preposed and postposed adverbial clauses. Most if not all
of the examples in Givén 1990 are constructed sentences. Still, this source
provides a good starting point for ways in which to analyze adverbial clause
data.
       An extensive taxonomy of adverbial clauses from a cross-linguistic
perspective is given in Thompson and Longacre 1985. Adverbial clause
constructions are defined as 'a set of two-clause constructions in which one
clause can be said to modify the other in a way similar to the way in which an
adverb modifies a proposition' (p. 171). This article has two parts. Part I
discusses in detail the types of adverbial clauses found around the world.
These are labeled according to the kinds of semantic relationships that they
signal,   specifically:     time,   location,   manner,   purpose,    reason,
circumstantial/means,     simultaneous, conditional, concessive, substitutive,
additive, and absolutive. Thompson has since discarded the absolutive
category.’ With each semantic category of adverbial clause, Thompson and
Longacre describe and explain certain structural or morphosyntactic
regularities that one usually finds associated with them. Part I of the study also
highlights similarities between the types of adverbial clauses and other kinds
of syntactic structures, for example juxtaposed clauses, that can convey similar
meanings.      There is also some discussion of borrowed subordinators;
specifically, the factors that lead to one language borrowing an adverbial
clause conjunction from another language. Part II of the Thompson and
Longacre study examines adverbial clauses from a discourse perspective in
monologic texts. It focuses on the ways in which adverbial clauses are relevant
to the structure of paragraphs and of the discourse as a whole. The issues and
questions addressed in Thompson and Longacre 1985, regarding both specific
types of adverbial clauses as well as specific functions, are a useful heuristic
for anyone planning a case study on adverbial clauses.
         Chafe 1984 explores how intonation contours and punctuation units
reflect the extent to which an adverbial clause is bound to its main clause, in
English written and conversational discourse. If both an adverbial clause and
its main clause occur in the same intonation or punctuation unit, the adverbial
clause is said to be 'bound'. Otherwise, it is said to be 'free'. This study                                        7
 compares four types of adverbial clauses: preposed clauses that are free,
 preposed clauses that are bound; postposed clauses that are free, and
 postposed clauses that are bound. A major finding was that adverbial clauses
 that are bound are almost always postposed. Chafe explains this tendency
 through the theory of Information Flow. The intonation/punctuation unit is the
 domain of information flow, with information flowing from the old or familiar
 to the new or unfamiliar. When two clauses fall under a single contour, it is
 likely that only one of the clauses will convey new or unfamiliar information.
 Chafe found that the postposed adverbial clauses contained the new or
unfamiliar information. A second important finding is that free adverbial
 clauses are much more common than bound adverbial clauses. Free adverbial
clauses tend to occur initially, however, because they function as 'guideposts'
to information flow, 'signaling a path or orientation in terms of which the
following information is to be understood ' (p. 444). This, according to Chafe,
is probably the prototypical function of adverbial clauses. For the free
adverbial clauses that occur postposed, Chafe found other explanations. Some
were afterthoughts. Other free, postposed adverbial clauses functioned to
modify only the latter part of the preceding main clause, rather than modifying
the entire main clause. This suggests, according to Chafe, that '...the modified
portion of the main clause [is] not even clearly articulated in the speaker’s
mind until the main clause was completed' (p. 447). The findings in Chafe’s
study are incorporated into the issues and questions I address in parts three
and four of this dissertation.
         Ford 1993 is an entire monograph devoted to the discourse functions
of adverbial clauses in American English conversation, using the sociological
framework of conversation analysis. Focusing on prosody and interaction
within a conversational context, the author examines the distribution and
discourse functions of temporal, conditional, and causal (reason) adverbial
clauses. There are two main conclusions. The first is that preposed adverbial
clauses play a significant, global role in the structuring of a discourse. The
second is that postposed adverbial clauses have a local role of modifying the
proposition of the preceding main clause, without affecting the overall
organization of the discourse. These conclusions are echoed throughout all of
the literature on adverbial clauses reviewed here, including those studies using
monologic data. Ford’s other findings are that conditional clauses are most
often initial, while temporal and causal (reason) clauses are most often final.
The reasons for these distributions are discussed in terms of factors that are
specific to talk-in-interaction, e.g. the system of turn-taking, problems in
understanding and agreement between speaker and hearer, the need to soften                                       8
assertions, personal motivations, listener prompts, etc. None of these factors
are directly applicable to the data in my Barbareno corpus. However,
throughout the book Ford makes specific predictions or generalizations about
the functions of initial and final temporal, conditional, and causal clauses.
These predictions provide another perspective that has proven useful to my
analyses of the Barbareno data in parts three and four of the dissertation.
        Haiman 1978 is a crosslinguistic study of the connection between
conditional clauses and topics. The author finds that, very often among
unrelated languages, conditional clauses and topics resemble each other in
marking and in function. Haiman notes that this similarity is at first surprising,
since topics and conditional clauses are structures that one would not normally
think to be related. Haiman’s discussion follows the premise that similarity in
structure must reflect a similarity in meaning since '...grammars tend to miss
semantic generalizations, rather than to create spurious ones' (p. 565). He
compares traditional definitions of conditional clauses in the philosophical
literature with definitions of 'topic' found in linguistics literature, and finds
that the definitions are similar. Topics and conditional clauses are found to be
unchallengeable and thereby ‘constitute the framework which has been
selected for the following discourse’ (pp. 583,585). In other words, both are
pragmatically presupposed (Givén 1990:830). The main conclusions from this
study are that conditional clauses and topics belong to the same category, and
that conditional clauses are the topics, i.e. givens or presuppositions, of the
sentences in which they occur. As Givén (1990:846) notes, this comparison of
adverbial clauses and topics can only go so far. Prototypical nominal topics
tend to be highly recurrent and important, i.e. anaphoric and cataphoric,
whereas adverbial clauses are rarely recurrent. Still, Haiman’s observations are
relevant to Barbareho data in that many initial adverbial clauses precede the
topic marker 21. This is especially true of those adverbial clauses that express
a conditional relation. The foregoing is the extent of the insight that Haiman
1978 provides for the purposes of my study, however, since his data consist of
sentences constructed in isolation.
        Ford and Thompson 1986 is a study of the discourse function of
conditionals in both spoken and written texts. One of the central aims of that
study is to test Haiman’s (1978) proposal that conditionals have the same
function as topics. The authors found that there are several functions that
conditional clauses may have in discourse contexts. Most of these are
associated with conditionals that occur in initial position. Like topics, initial
conditionals serve as a framework of shared information for the following
discourse. First, initial conditionals may be used to repeat claims voiced earlier                                        9
in the discourse. A different, second function is that they may establish
contrasts with information given earlier in the discourse. Or, third, they can be
used to introduce particular cases exemplifying preceding generalizations.
Finally, initial conditionals may also function to offer other options or points
of view that are relevant to those of the preceding discourse. Final
conditionals, unlike initial conditionals, seem to be motivated by factors that
have little to do with the need for a shared frame of reference. For example,
the length of the conditional clause can affect whether it is initial or final;
lengthy ones tend to be final. If the conditional clause is embedded within
another clause then it tends to be postposed, and its scope is limited to the
embedded clause. Also, important or lengthy subjects in the consequent clause
tend to be initial rather than final, which means that the conditional clause has
to be final. Ford and Thompson also found that final conditionals tend to
follow main clauses that express an evaluation or question, though they cannot
explain why this should be so. Final conditional clauses do not play as
important a role in organizing the frame of a discourse as initial conditionals
do; they are not pivotal points in the development of a discourse. One notable
function of final conditionals, however, is that they often function to introduce
afterthoughts or serve as reminders. In conversational texts, conditionals are
used to make polite requests, or otherwise make a given point of view appear
less dogmatic or intrusive. The texts in my Barbareno database are not
conversational texts. Nonetheless, the Ford and Thompson study provides
many insights that have been incorporated into chapter 21 of this dissertation.
         Thompson 1985 is a seminal study of the discourse properties of
purpose clauses in written English texts. The author focuses on the different
discourse functions of initial and final purpose clauses. Her main findings are
that initial and final purpose clauses have radically different roles with respect
to the organization of the discourse, even though both types of clauses have
a similar structure:        '...the initial purpose clause functions to state a ""problem"" within
       the context of expectations raised by the preceding discourse, to which
       the following material (often many clauses) provides a solution, while
       the final purpose clause plays the much more local role of stating the
       purpose for which the action named in the immediately preceding
       clause is performed' (p. 55).","[28, 29, 30, 31, 32]"
"
21.1.2 Establishing contrasts
        A second discourse function that conditional clauses are known to have
is that of establishing contrasts with information given earlier in the discourse
(Thompson and Longacre 1985:222-223, Ford and Thompson 1986, Ford
 1993). This function is another way that an initial conditional clause provides
a framework of shared information, through which the reader/listener
interprets the information in the immediately following discourse.
        This function of establishing contrasts could be subcategorized under
the broader function of exploring options and alternatives (Ford 1993:56-59).
Contrasts often involve pairs of initial adverbial clauses, the first one
introducing one option, the second one establishing a contrast or opposing
option to the first option (Ford 1993; see also Longacre 1976:105-106 on the
relation between two-pronged contrasts and 'but' structures). In addition, as
we will see, in the Barbareho data there is significant lexical overlap both in
conditionals that introduce options and in conditionals that introduce
contrasts. However, in the Barbareno data, negation is always directly involved
in creating the contrasts that initial conditional clauses help to establish, but
negation may or may not play a direct role in helping initial conditional
clauses create options and alternatives. For this reason I treat these two
functions as being separate, though they are related. The important ingredient
of negation is echoed in the schematic formula in (7), which Ford and
Thompson (1986:357) give for this discourse function (though Ford and
Thompson do not suggest that contrasting conditionals must have a morpheme
that signals negation).",[454]

        As noted in Thompson and Longacre (1985:193), in languages
throughout the world it is not uncommon to have neutralization of conditional
and temporal relations. Such neutralization is found in Barbareho Chumash
as well. Out of the 152 tokens of mali ‘when' clauses, 133 (87.5%) are
temporal. The other 19 (12.5%) are semantically neutral; neither a temporal
nor a conditional relation can be strictly inferred. No time frame, temporal

"12.1.4 Exceptional cases
        There are a few baffling Gukanu clause tokens that do not fit any of
the patterns discussed above with regard to subject marking. These tokens are
especially troubling because it appears that Harrington changed his
transcription. He seems to have inserted a subject pronoun into the verb in
question, a pronoun that should not be there given the patterns of control and

subject does not have much control over its situation. Instead, it is the main
clause subject that has control. In (15), the main-clause shaman is able to
scare away the adverbial-clause ghost. In (16), the main-clause people are able
to make the adverbial-clause bear calm down by providing it with honey.
(Presumably an out-of-control bear cannot, on its own volition, change its state
of mind.) Yet, this lack of control on the part of the adverbial clause subject
is not what accounts for the absence of the subject prefix in those Gu clauses.
If lack of control were a motivation, then the subject prefix would be absent
in all of the Gu clauses seen earlier in (7) though (10), where the main clause
subject has control over what happens to the adverbial clause subject.
         The most likely reason that the third person prefix s- does not appear
in the Gu clause verbs in question is that the s- would be difficult to
pronounce or hear, given the kind of phonetic environment they are in. In
each of these tokens, the Gu-clause verb stem begins with a sibilant, ie. [s]
or remy. Also, in (15), in the éu-clause verb stem suxnihan 'to scare
away', the next consonant after the stem initial [s] is the velar (or back
velar) fricative [x]. Given these facts, it is possible that articulatory difficulties
rendered the third pronominal prefix s~ unpronounced. For example, in (15),                                                    251
the Gu clause verb is phonetically [Gu.su.xi-.fhan]. If the third
pronominal prefix s- were to be pronounced, Mary Yee would have had to
aspirate the stem-initial [s ] of the verb, and thus say [éu. s®u.xi:.han ]2
The Gu-clause verbs in (16) line d. and (17) would also have the difficult
pronunciation of [Gus.é""o- ], if the third pronominal prefix s- were to be
pronounced. Given the close proximity of so many sibilants and fricatives, this
articulation would be especially cumbersome, except perhaps in unnaturally
slow speech. In the regular rate of speech, it would be much easier to say
[Gu.su.xi:han] and [Gu.é""6: ], which are the attested forms.","[272, 273, 274]"

       so that all will respect him as a person. 'In (9) above, the main clause is in line f. It is followed by two Gukanu
clauses: a same-subject Gukanu clause in g. and a different-subject Cukanu
clause in h. The same-subject clause in g. did not retain the subject pronoun
s~, but the pronoun for the different-subject clause in h. is retained. The
reason again has to do with whether or not the main clause subject has
control. As has been pointed out, those who wear the bear claw talisman can
become strong, at will, by using the bear claw talisman. The same-subject
éukanu clause in g. reflects this control by the suppression of the subject
pronoun. The ones who wear the bear claw talisman do not, however, have
control over whether people have respect for them or hold them in high
esteem. The different-subject adverbial clause reflects this by retaining the
third person subject pronoun s-. Possibly a very strong person could threaten
others and thereby force them to act respectfully. If such were the case, one
would expect that the subject pronoun s~ would not be retained in the
adverbial clause. That is, one would expect to see *?amsa?2suku instead of
the attested samsa?suku in line h.
        Another instance in which the main clause subject does not have full
control is given in (10). The example is from a narrative about a man who
wanted to give the appearance of having many lovers. Though the main clause
subject has control over how much he scratches himself up (=the main clause
event), he does not have control over the extent to which the scratches make
him look, in the eyes of others, to be the favorite of women (= adverbial
clause event). In fact, the point of the story is the humorous irony that, in
spite of his efforts, he did not fool anyone; everyone instead thought that he
was simply half crazy. The main clause in question is a relative clause with the
meaning 'who used to scratch himself up'. The Head NP, hi=1=2ihiy ‘a
man', has a grammatical role of subject in its relative clause. The referent is
indexed on the verb 'scratch up oneself' with the third person subject prefix
s-. The different-subject Gukanu adverbial clause 'so that it would appear
they (women) like him very much' has pronominal marking with the third
person s— on the verb uxwal 'to resemble, to appear'.","[288, 289]"

                                  Chapter 19             Differences in the Prosodic/Punctuation     Boundary
         In studies done mostly on English adverbial clauses, it has been found
that initial adverbial clauses are more likely than final clauses to be separated
from the corresponding main clause by a prosodic boundary or pause in
spoken speech, or by some form of punctuation (such as a comma) in written
language (Chafe 1984, Thompson 1985, Quirk et al. 1985, Ramsay 1987, Givén
 1990:847). The extent to which there is a boundary or pause corresponds with
the extent to which the dependent clause is conceptually bound to its
associated modified material. Furthermore, the degree of conceptual
connectedness varies depending upon the kind of semantic relation coded by
the adverbial clause. For example, Ford (1992, 1993) found that final temporal
clauses are most likely not to be separated from the preceding, associated
clause by a prosodic boundary in spoken speech, or by punctuation in written
speech. Final reason clauses, however, are more likely to be separated from
the preceding, associated material by a prosodic boundary or by a punctuation
mark. This difference in the presence/absence of a prosodic/punctuation
boundary relates to the difference in the degree to which the adverbial clause
is conceptually dependent upon its preceding, associated material (Ford 1992,
1993; see also Hengeveld 1998:347).!
         In this chapter we will explore how Harrington used punctuation in his
transcriptions of adverbial clause constructions in Mary Yee’s Barbareno
Chumash narratives. Working from the assumption that punctuation marks
such as a comma and period indicate a pause, we will explore the extent to
which the punctuation marks in Harrington’s transcription show any patterns
and, if they do, we will see to what extent they reflect the patterns of
punctuation and prosodic boundaries reported in other studies of adverbial
clauses.
         It is first of all an interesting question whether the punctuation in
Harrington’s transcription really does reflect prosodic boundaries in Mary
Yee’s speech as she was dictating the narratives to him. There is an inevitable
obscuring of prosodic boundaries when texts are dictated, and even more so
when the stories that are dictated are ones that have been handed down
through the generations. A philological study of Harrington’s transcription
revealed that he was meticulous in noting pauses or hiatuses between                                       374
morphemes, by using a hyphen (Wash 1997). He did not appear to be as
meticulous in noting pauses at the more macro, discourse level. However, an
examination of Harrington’s punctuation in adverbial clause constructions
reveals some systematic usage. An overall tabulation of punctuation for the
preposed and postposed adverbial clauses from chapters 4 - 16 is given in
Table 42. Slightly over half (58%) of the initial clauses are followed by
punctuation, but a greater percentage of final clauses (62%) have no
intervening punctuation after their main clause.","[394, 395, 396, 397]"
"Ways in which point of view ts coded
       Four adverbial clause conjunctions were found to have a significant role
in coding the narrator’s or speaker’s stance, point of view, or expectations
about when and whether a given event had occurred, could occur, or would
occur. Generally, when the haku ‘if' conjunction is used, the event or
situation named in the adverbial clause is believed to be very unlikely but not
altogether impossible. When the na 'if; when' conjunction is used, the event
or situation is believed to be possible indeed, but it is not necessarily expected
to occur. When the mali 'when' conjunction is used, the connotation is that
the event or situation is not only likely to occur, but it may also be expected
to occur. The conjunction wa ‘if; when' seems to be used when the speaker
does not wish to frame a given event or situation from his or her own
perspective, expectations, or experience. One reason for the speaker’s
reluctance could be that he or she does not have enough first-hand evidence                                                          350
or personal experience to make claims concerning the matter under discussion.
The conjunction wa also appears to be used when the speaker wishes to
refrain from making any assumptions about what another person or entity can
dc or will do,
            do. In
                ¥
                   other
                    +
                         words, the speaker is not asserting his or her own
personal stance when he or she uses a wa adverbial clause.
        The usage of the wa ‘if; when' conjunction is similar to the usage of
the na ‘if; when' conjunction in certain respects. The na conjunction can be
used to express a neutral stance, or a neutral expectation, about what another
person or entity will do or is able to do. However, whereas the na conjunction
implies that the speaker is speaking from his or her own perspective (however
neutral), the use of the wa conjunction seems to imply that, whatever the
speaker is saying, it is not something he or she is framing from his or her own
perspective.
        At least three of the four adverbial clause conjunctions mentioned
above (wa    ‘if; when', na   ‘if; when'    and haku   'if') can be combined with
other adverbial clause conjunctions to convey even more subtle distinctions in
the speaker’s stance or perspective. We saw, for example, that the conjunction
wa can be combined with the adverbial clause conjunction 2akay hu ‘until’.
The result is still an adverbial clause that codes a terminal temporal boundary,
but the conjunction wa adds an additional layer of meaning. It says that the
speaker’s own perspective is not adequate for determining when the terminal,
temporal event has happened, or whether it even can happen; rather, the
perspective necessary is that of someone else, specifically that of the referent
that is coded as the subject of the adverbial clause. Also, the concessive
conjunction 2iyeme ‘though; even if' may combine with either haku 'if'
or na   ‘if; when’   to form different kinds of concessive conditional relations.
Though there were not enough tokens of the 2iyemhe 'though; even if'
clause type to allow strong claims about the exact meanings that could be
conveyed, there is little doubt that Barbareho Chumash speakers were able
to make subtle distinctions in concessive and concessive conditional meanings
by varying the combination of these conjunctions and other morphosyntax.
        Understanding how expectations and points of view are conveyed by
adverbial clause conjunctions is a difficult task, especially when the language
in question is no longer spoken and all of the data come from monologic
narratives. It would be doubtless enlightening to see how these conjunctions
were used in interactional contexts such as conversation. The analyses I have
offered give at best a glimpse of the ways that Barbareho Chumash people
once used these conjunctions to express, or to refrain from expressing, their
expectations and points of view.","[372, 373]"

Emphatic glottalization is often encliticized onto the final syllable, and an
epenthetic /?/ begins the word if it is otherwise vowel initial. The imperative
form of kutiy takes a slightly different form when its meaning includes a
third singular object. In such cases it ends with /l/ instead of /y/.       kutiyit                   ""look at me!*

features of irreality found in conditional relations (Givén 1990). I code it as
a conditional token, though Harrington translated the wa conjunction here as
 'when'. One could possibly analyze this token as a temporal clause that
codes an initial boundary, such that the main clause event 'Take notice!' is
only to occur upon the start of the adverbial clause event 'when you hear an
owl sound'.","[243, 244]"

special conjunction for negative purpose clauses. An example in English is the
negative purpose conjunction ‘lest '. In Barbarenho Chumash, that conjunction
is ku 'lest, so that..not'. The Ku adverbial clause type is rare, with only two
tokens in the corpus. Yet, it is worth a brief discussion because it shares some
semantic space with negated Gu 'so that, in order to' purposive clauses
(chapter 11) as well as with haku '‘if' conditional clauses (chapter 7).
         The ku conjunction probably has a historical connection with the
conjunction haku 'if', found in conditional and semantically neutral relations.
Adverbial clauses with the conjunctions ku and haku are alike in that both
clause types code unreal, hypothetical situations. But whereas haku clauses
may code a condition, ku clauses code the purpose of the main clause
subject’s action. Specifically with ku clauses, the purpose of the main clause
subject’s action is to avoid an undesirable situation.
         It is not entirely clear what the difference in meaning would be for a
purpose clause that has the ku conjunction versus a clause that has the Gu
 'so that, in order to' conjunction and the negative prefix e-. In line c. of the
first example below, Mary Yee offered two ways of saying a purposive clause
in which these two conjunctions were contrasted. Harrington noted that these
minimal pairs were ‘carefully contrasted' (59.0586), but he did not state
whether Yee preferred one over the other.","[311, 312]"

preceding the verb, then the article will be attached to that element instead
of the verb. The verb is then inflected for person the same as it would be in
an independent clause. For example, the verbs in (268) and (269) are both
preceded by the particle howo 'still, yet'. In (268) the third person subject
is singular; in (269) the third person subject is plural. In both instances the
verbs retain the third person pronoun s-, while the article 1= is attached to

same thing: 'one who was unknown! or 'one who they (indef.) did not
know '. In head-marking languages, especially, NPs that are clausal arguments
further delineate or elaborate upon the information encoded in the head verb.

        Nominalized clauses with a first or second person subject are relatively
infrequent in the corpus. Unlike nominalized clauses with a third person
subject, such clauses do not take the article 1=. Also, the pronoun is always
kept: k- if the subject is in first person, or p- if the subject is in second
person. Finally, these clauses always have the prefix -al-. This subordinator
appears mainly in constructions involving focussed or contrasted NPs,
appositions, questions, and relative clauses. Almost always, the subject of the
clause is in the first or second person; exceptions are rare.’ Below are some
examples of nominalized clauses with subjects in the first or second person.","[99, 100, 101, 102]"

Since the subject of the verb s-?ip 'she said' in line h. has not been
previously mentioned in this text, it has to be introduced. Otherwise the
listener would not know who the third pronominal prefix s~ was referring to.
The subject is thus explicitly mentioned in the form of the NP hi=luwisa
 'Luisa'. Since this referent is now activated in the consciousness of the
listener, the temporal clause need only refer to it with the third person subject
prefix s- in s-tikuy-us '(lit.) she talked about it'. Since the temporal
clause only refers to this referent with a pronominal affix, the postposition of
the clause makes it possible for the listener to know immediately who is being
                                           507
referred to (in the temporal clause). If the temporal clause were preposed,
however, it would not be immediately clear to the listener who was being
referred to in the situation ‘when she talked about these songs'.
        For the same reason, ie. ease of processing
                                             Tere
                                               Nh   and information flow, one
would not expect a scenario such as the hypothetical example below,(38) Hypothetical example based on (37) lines h. and i.a.     nali_   s-tikuy-us     hi=he?=1   =niw-niwiS-?       bhi=luwisa

       <When Luisa talked about these songs,>b.     ?i =s-?ip:
       TOP=3-say
       <she said:>
In the above hypothetical example, both the full NPs hi=he?=1=niw-
niwiS-2 ‘these songs' and hi=luwisa 'Luisa' are core arguments of the
verb tikuy-us 'to talk about'. One of them ('Luisa') has not been
mentioned previously and is therefore not already in the listener’s focus of
consciousness. The other core argument (' these songs'), has been mentioned
previously (line f. of (37)), but it has to be re-activated in the listener’s focus
of consciouness because other referents have been mentioned in the
meantime. Situations such as this, where a single utterance has two core
arguments that require activation, create too much of a cognitive-processing
burden for the listener. It is for this reason that, in spoken genres of discourse
crosslinguistically, one rarely finds utterances with two core arguments coded
as full NPs (Du Bois 1987, Mithun 1987, Doris Payne 1987, 1990, Durant and
Ochs 1990). The generalization has likewise been proven true for Barbareno
Chumash (Ono 1996; see also Ono 1996 for a clear discussion of argument
structure, constituent order and information flow in Barbareno Chumash
discourse). The hypothetical scenario in (38), then, would not be a likely
option.","[528, 529, 530]"

20.1 Initial purpose clauses
       As is true for initial purpose clauses in English (Thompson 1985), initial
purpose clauses in Barbareho Chumash generally function to state a problem
or goal, one which   results from    an expectation     oor assumption       expressed   irin thepreceding discourse. The solution typically involves a sequence of events that
form a procedure for achieving the goal named in the initial purpose clause.
Hence, initial purpose clauses tend to be found in procedural texts, or in
stretches of speech that describe a sequence of steps for accomplishing a given
goal.
        The excerpt in (1) describes the procedure for making a kind of home-
made candle, called      a candil, which the Chumash began to use soon after
the Spanish came to their land. The context preceding the initial purpose
clause is given in line a. We learn that there was a type of tallow candle
available for purchase, but it was a kind of candle that was not economical to
use. The Chumash used a more economical, home-made alternative called the
candil. Thus in the preceding context there arises the expectation and
assumption that there was a need for the candil, and that there must have
been a way for the Chumash to make it. The initial purpose clause in line b.
expresses the problem, 'To make a candil...', and serves as a link between
the preceding context in line a. and the sequence of events in lines c. through
x., Which delineate the procedure or ‘solution’ for making this kind of light
source.","[422, 423]"

          Part ITypes of Adverbiai Ciauses
            115
                             Introduction to Part IE
        Barbareno Chumash is a language with a rich variety of adverbial
clause constructions. In this part of the dissertation I discuss and illustrate the
subtleties and complexities one finds in the syntax, morphology and semantics
of this domain of Barbareho grammar.
        Barbareho adverbial clauses code a variety of semantic relations with
main clauses, including temporal, conditional, concessive, purposive, reason,
and manner relations. Some adverbial clause types code only one of these
relations, whereas others code several of them. Some of the adverbial clause
types, however, have tokens that are semantically neutral with respect to
conditionality and time.
        As we explore the ways in which these adverbial clause types code
semantic relations, we will come upon interesting issues and striking
grammatical patterns. Some of these are discussed and predicted in the
typological literature on adverbial clauses, in particular Thompson and
Longacre 1985 and Givén 1990. For example, it is known that adverbial
conjunctions that are semantically unspecific, like English 'when', generally
need to be accompanied by specific tense and aspectual morphology, and/or
lexical temporal indicators, in order to code specific kinds of temporal
relations unambiguously. We see further confirmation of this generalization in
such Barbareho adverbial clause types as mali ‘when' in chapter 6, na if;
when' in chapter 8, and wa ‘if; when' in chapter 9. These adverbial clause
types code temporal relations as well as other kinds of relations.
        One often finds conditional relations to be indicated and underscored
by the modal morphology of a language. We will see that this is also the case
for conditional relations coded by Barbareno adverbial clauses, specifically
haku   'if' clauses in chapter 7,na     ‘if; when'   clauses in chapter 8, and wa
 ‘if; when' clauses in chapter 9.
         Distinctive patterns of pronominal subject marking are well known and
expected in purposive relations. In English, for example, subject marking can
be suppressed in same-subject purpose clauses. In chapter 12, we will see in
the Gukanu clause type, which codes only purposive relations, that subject
marking may be suppressed in either same-subject or different-subject purpose
clauses. We will see that the semantics of agency and control is the motivating
factor that affects pronominal suppression in this adverbial clause type. In
other Barbareho adverbial clause types, however, just the fact that the                                       116
adverbial clause has the same subject as the main clause is enough to create
a semantic bond that is tight enough to allow such pronominal suppression.
We will see this pattern in simultaneous temporal relations coded by
 2akimpi ? ‘during; while' clauses in chapter 5, reason relations coded by
kayké       'because' clauses in chapter 14, and finally in manner relations
coded by kaneé        'like; as if‘ clauses in chapter 16. Pronominal subject
suppression is attested only for third person subjects--first and second person
subject pronouns are always retained in the adverbial clause.
         Sometimes mentioned in the crosslinguistic literature is the fact that an
adverbial conjunction may code the speaker’s or narrator’s expectations with
regard to the likelihood that a given event will occur. For example in English,
the conjunction 'when' connotes a greater expectation or likelihood than the
conjunction ‘if'. In the grammar of Barbareho Chumash adverbial clauses,
this is an important and complex category. Several adverbial conjunctions play
a role in coding the speaker’s point of view with regard to when and whether
an event can occur, will occur, or could have already occurred: mali                   ‘if;
when' clauses (chapter 6), haku 'if' clauses (chapter 7), na ‘if; when'
clauses (chapter 8), and wa _ ‘if; when' clauses (chapter 9). See also the
2akay hu ‘until' clauses in chapter 4 and 2iyeme ‘though; although'
clauses in chapter 10.
        Barbareno Chumash has two adverbial clause types that code
distinctions in reason relations. The Kayké 'because' clauses (chapter 14)
tend to provide motivations for acts performed through talk such as
commands and claims, and reasons for conclusions that are inferred. The
ihehu ""because, since, from' clauses (chapter 15) code causal relations in
which   one    event   causes     another      event   to   occur.   Also,   mehu   clause
constructions always depict unintentional acts or results. The differences in the
reason relations coded by these two clause types reflect distinctions between
internal and external motivations (Halliday and Hasan 1976, Givén 1990:834-
835), distinctions among action-based, knowledged-based and fact-based causal
relations (Schiffrin 1987), and distinctions among fourth-, third- and second-
order types of causal relations in the Entity Type Hierarchy (Hengeveld 1998),
in that mehu     clauses   code    external,    fact-based,    and   second-order   causal
relations.
        There is an array of adverbial clause types that one can identify based
upon specific adverbial conjunctions. Thirteen such clause types are analyzed,
discussed and illustrated in chapters 4 through 16. These comprise almost all
of the adverbial clause types that have conjunctions in this language. There
may be other kinds of Barbareho adverbial clause types that have                                            117
conjunctions, but some possible adverbial clause types were not included
because they could not be clearly identified as adverbial clauses. Also, a
possible adverbial clause type was omitted if there were not enough data or
context that would allow a substantive-enough discussionand illustration for
that particular adverbial clause type. Still, the adverbial clause types discussed
and illustrated in chapters 4 through 16 range from the very rare ku ‘lest, so

the adverbial conjunction, including its history and any cognates it is known to
have. Next is an overall view of the number of tokens the adverbial clause
type has, what kinds of semantic relations it codes, and what positions
(preposed or postposed) it may take. The body of each chapter then illustrates
each relevant semantic relation and the ways in which it is coded in that clause
type. Special attention is given to those issues and patterns that stand out, e.g.
unusual or prominent patterns in person marking, tense/aspect/modality, ways
in which the speaker’s point of view is coded, etc.
        The focus of part II of the dissertation is upon 13 adverbial clause
types that have adverbial conjunctions. A much smaller subset of Barbareho
adverbial clauses lack adverbial conjunctions. They are discussed in chapter
3, to which we now turn.","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140]"

21.0 Introduction
         Like initial and final purpose clauses, initial and final conditional
clauses have different functions within a discourse context. (See especially
Ford and Thompson 1986, Ford 1993 and Ramsey 1987 for conditional clauses
in English discourse, and Marchese 1987 for conditional clauses in Godié
procedural discourse.) My approach to understanding the discourse functions
of conditional clauses in Barbareho Chumash oral narratives owes much in
particular to the insights of the Ford & Thompson 1986 and Ford 1993
studies.
         As is true with initial adverbial clauses in general, initial conditional
clauses in Barbareno Chumash have a more global role than final conditional
clauses, in discourse. Both initial and final conditional clauses serve to qualify
the meaning of the associated main clause, but initial conditional clauses in
Barbareho do several kinds of discourse-management work that final
conditional clauses do not do: i) they may develop a discourse by introducing
options or alternatives; ii) they may establish contrasts with information given
earlier in the discourse; iii) they may repeat claims that were mentioned
earlier in the discourse; iv) they may give a particular example of a
generalization given earlier in the discourse; and finally, v) they may establish
a background setting, often at or near the beginning of a narrative.
         Final conditional clauses in Barbareho are restricted in function to
qualifying the proposition expressed in its main clause. They do not create
discourse-level links as their initial counterparts do.
         Conditional clauses in Barbareho have an overwhelming tendency to
function in the more global, discourse-organizing capacity. This functional bias
is reflected in the distribution of conditional clauses, in that 86% of the tokens
are preposed. The reason for this preference in function is that the inherent,
hypothetical meaning of a conditional clause lends itself well to the creation
of temporary discourse worlds or realities (Ford 1993), which then provide a
framework for contextualizing the information in the propositions that follow.
        This chapter is organized as follows. Preposed conditional clauses are
discussed in 21.1, followed by postposed conditional clauses in 21.2. A
summary closes the chapter in 21.3.","[444, 445]"
"The   conditional   clause    in line     d.    ‘but    if they    don’t   come   down',    has
significant lexical overlap with the clause that immediately precedes it, ' they
come down right away'. It thus establishes an explicit contrast with the
preceding material. The second contrastive conditional, '[Because] if they
don’t escape the freshet' (line f.), does not explicitly link up to anything in the
prior text. It establishes a contrast with the implicit assumption, in the
preceding discourse, that the salamanders instinctively know to escape the
freshet by climbing up the hill before a big rain and staying on the hill until
the rain stops.
       Negation that is involved in establishing contrasts does not necessarily
have to appear in the conditional clause, as it does in examples (9) and (10).
For example, in (11) line b., the negative prefix e- appears in an independent
clause, preceding the conditional clause in line c.",[458]

                                      Suzanne Wash
        This dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareno Chumash, an indigenous language of California. It explores the
semantic relations, morphosyntactic structure, and discourse functions of
adverbial clauses in this language, with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses crosslinguistically, and from a functionally-
oriented approach to linguistics. Almost all of the data come from narratives
recorded in the 1950s by John Harrington from Mary Yee, the last speaker of
the Barbareho Chumash language.
        The dissertation is divided into five parts. Part I is the preliminaries. It
includes a detailed grammatical sketch of the Barbareno Chumash language.
In Part II I analyze the semantic and morphosyntactic characteristics of
thirteen structurally-distinguishable adverbial clause types. The adverbial
clauses    code    temporal,   conditional,     concessive,    purposive,   reason/causal,
manner, and semantically neutral relations. Semantically neutral adverbial
clauses have both temporal and conditional meanings, and though most
researchers treat such clauses as conditional, in this study I treat them as a
category separate from the temporal and conditional categories. In Part TI I
compare the initial and final tokens of these clause types with respect to
similarities      and   differences    in       structure,    extent   of    scope,    and
punctuation/prosodic boundaries. In Part IV I focus on the similarities and
differences in discourse functions between initial and final clauses that code
purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral relations. In addition
to their qualifying role, the initial adverbial clauses function as pivotal points
of orientation that help create a cohesive and coherent text. However, the
final adverbial clauses only serve to qualify the main clause. They do not
function as pivotal points of orientation in a discourse. These differences
between initial and final adverbial clauses are found crosslinguistically, and
reflect the general cognitive processes involved in the production and
comprehension of discourse (Giv6n 1995). Finally, I conclude this study with
the closing remarks in Part V.                                                               ,                                              viii

1.1 Purpose of this study
         This dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareho Chumash, an indigenous language of California. The goals of the
dissertation are two-fold. First, it describes what adverbial clauses look like in
this language, sorting them into types that correspond to certain structural
criteria. Second, it explores discourse-functional explanations for the ways in
which the adverbial clauses pattern as they do in Barbareho Chumash
narratives. Both of these goals are met with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses cross-linguistically, in both their grammatical
and discourse-functional properties.
         Much has been published on adverbial clauses. Almost all studies on
adverbial clauses, however, use constructed sentences for data. Relatively few
studies have examined adverbial clauses within the context of non-constructed,
connected discourse, such as monologic narratives and conversation. This
dissertation not only examines adverbial clauses from a discourse context, but
it also provides a rare, in-depth look at adverbial clauses in an American
Indian language. For the reasons cited above, this study aims to be a worthy
contribution to the cross-linguistic literature on adverbial clauses and, more
generally, to discourse-functional perspectives on language.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"The conditional clause ‘if Domi hadn’t (come)' has negation in the form of
the contraction -n’t on the verb had. Negation in Barbareno Chumash always
appears in the form of the prefix -e-. As we will see shortly, in the
counterfactual conditional clause in (9) line f., this negative prefix is seen in
the verb s-e-2u8""02-was '{if] she hadn’t let (him)'.
        In the narrative below there are three preposed conditional clauses.
The first one (line a.) sets the scene with the hypothetical scenario of an old
man wanting to hold a baby. The second preposed conditional clause (line c.)
explores a possible option within this hypothetical scenario, one in which the
old man has some kind of power in his blood that would necessitate him
holding the baby for only a brief moment. Finally, the counterfactual
conditional clause in line f. gives a counter-consideration, a hypothetical
scenario in which the mother had not let the old man hold the baby at all, and
all the consequences that would result from that.",[455]
