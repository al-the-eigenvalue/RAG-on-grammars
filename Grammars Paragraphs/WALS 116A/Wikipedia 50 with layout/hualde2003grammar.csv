"Verb focalization is occasionally found in yes/no questions. This is possible
in the event emphasis type of focalization described in 4.4.3.2.1. Thus, the
following questions contain a verb emphasized with egin(957) Ahaztu egin al zarete nirekin?
       forget do     Q AUX        I.with
      'Have you forgotten me?' [Atx. Ob.:54](958)    ΉίΙ      egin      al da?'        galdetu    nuen.
         die      do        Q    AUX       ask       AUX
        ""Has he died?', I asked.' [Atx. Ob.: 125]As for positive polar emphasis, it uses the same verb-fronting mechanism as
yes/no questions, and is therefore virtually indistinguishable from it.",[526]
"4.4.5.1.2.1. Indirect yes/no questionsAs an alternative to -n, yes/no questions may also be marked by -n(e)z,
-nen(t)z in eastern dialects. Moreover, in substandard southern usages it is
common to find the conditional particle ba (usually with a suprasegmental
pattern which differentiates it from the emphatic marker ba) as the only
marker of indirect questions (cf. Spanish conditional and interrogative si):(890) Ez dakit zure laguna etorriko            d-entba-da.
       not know your friend come.FUT AUX-COMP/if-AUX
      Ί don't know whether your friend will come.'
      [Hualdeetal. 1994:186](891) Irunen           eman zuenez      bere leheti meza,
       Pamplona.in give AUX.COMP his           first mass
       ala Baionan, ezin       jakin dugu.
       or Baiona.in cannot know AUX
      'Whether he sang mass first in Pamplona or in Baiona, we can't tell.'
      [Etch. Id. 1:236]Abstracting away from the effects produced by scrambling, indirect yes/no
questions tend to be verb final, unless they contain any focalized material,
in which case the verbal element will immediately follow the focus in the
left periphery of the clause. Thus, in the last example above, Irunen has
been contrasted with Baionan, and as a consequence of their left-position
the object appears to the right of the verb. When no constituent has been fo-
calized, there is no apparent leftward movement of the verb (unlike what
happens in many direct yes/no questions). Due to the lack of verb fronting,
ba is less common in indirect than in direct questions, although examples do
exist:

        'The king asked him whether he knew [how] to do anything.' [Atx.
        Ob.\21A]Verb focalization with egin is also possible, just like in direct yes/no ques-
tions:(894) ea denak         lotsatu              egiten    ziren     beren     lanaz
         ea all       be.embarrassed do.lMPF AUX their                    work.lNSTR
        '[I asked him] whether all were ashamed of their job.'
        [Atx. Ob.: 138]It is difficult to form tenseless indirect yes/no questions, perhaps because
the only overt marker (-n) can only be attached to tensed forms and nothing
would signal the presence of an indirect question in a tenseless clause.
However, they can be formed by adding question identifiers such as ala ez
to the participial form (or to the root in eastern dialects):(895)    *Ez dakit gelditu.
          not know remain
        Ί don't know whether to remain.'","[512, 513]"
"    The words or phrases responding to the question words sir 'what' and
nor 'who' are interpreted as the most important part of the sentence infor-
mationally, that is, as phrases that provide the necessary information that
fills the gap corresponding to the question word. In pragmatic terms, this
constituent is referred to as new information, rheme, or focus. Azkue and
Altube called this element the 'inquired element', referring to the corre-
spondence between this phrase and a presupposed question, and the position
immediately preceding the verb as the position of the inquired element. The
verb itself may be the most prominent element prosodically and semanti-
cally, as we will see below.
    But the focus or rheme of an utterance does not have to be triggered by a
question. It might appear in a sentence independently in a discourse, as the
speaker organizes and divides his/her utterances in parts carrying different
informational load: theme and rheme, old and new information, or topic and
focus. Like with answers to questions, the constituent that represents the
rheme, new information or focus of a sentence without being the answer to a
question appears immediately preceding the verb, at least in Northern Biz-
kaian varieties such as Lekeitio Basque (cf. also 4.4). In other varieties, fo-
calized or new information constituents can appear postverbally within a
78      Phonology
speaker's narrative discourse, but they must appear preverbally when they
constitute the answer to a wh-word in a preceding question (cf. section
4.4.8).
   It is important to point out that the preverbal constituent is not always in-
terpreted as the most prominent element informationally. A whole sentence
may constitute new information as well, if it is uttered out of the blue or as
an answer to a question such as 'What happened?', and reflects the canoni-
cal word order in Basque (S-IO-DO-V). In this case, it is still the word pre-
ceding the verb that receives the main prosodic prominence, without any
difference in pitch level or pitch excursion with respect to a sentence in
which the word or phrase preceding the verb constitutes new information.
Thus, if the sentence in (7) were the answer to a question such as 'What
happened?', or were uttered out of the blue, the pitch contour of the utter-
ance would be the same as if the preverbal phrase (i.e., the direct object
madari bat 'a pear') were the focalized constituent. The FO contour is illus-
trated in Fig. 3.","[107, 108]"
"   Nevertheless, this strategy has limited occurrence; it cannot be applied in
answers to questions, for instance. Thus, the previous example would be in-
felicitous as an answer to the question 'Who is that?'. This strategy is found
in narratives, with a pause after the verb, as if the element were dislocated
from the rest of the sentence. Leaving aside these cases, it can be stated that
in Lekeitio Basque there is a fixed position for the occurrence of a word or
phrase that constitutes new information in the sentence (see section 4.4.3.2
for more detailed information).",[113]

4.4.3. Yes/no questions and verb focalization4.4.3.1. Direct yes/no questionsYes/no questions need not be signalled by any mark other than interrogative
intonation:(818) Jonek       liburu hori irakurri du?
       Jon. ERG book that read         AUX
      'Has Jon read that book?'",[497]
"(1475) Et        taigu   inor         ari gau               eta     egun        bi
         not     AUX     anybody      ari     night       and       day         two

          and two four arc.ela say.ten

         [Mitx. EIG 1:143]
                                                                Subordination 645
In example (1475) the author, Κ. Mitxelena, is taking for granted that two
and two are four; and in (1474), when -ela is used we presuppose that the
earth truly revolves around the sun regardless of our daughter's beliefs,
whereas no such presupposition is made with the form -enik. Laka
(1990:214) and Uribe-Etxebarria (1994:173) suggest that a sentence headed
by -enik is necessarily interpreted within the scope of negation, whereas the
opposite would be true of a sentence headed by -ela. See 4.5.4.4.
   It is hard not to see that this -enik suffix looks like the combination of the
-en (be it relative or interrogative) plus the partitive determiner -rik. Two
pieces of data confirm this suspicion: just like in the case of the partitive de-
terminer, a yes-no matrix question may reportedly trigger the use of -enik
(instead of the more general -ela) as the head of the embedded non-
interrogative clause:(1476) a.   Uste al dezute dirua          nik    ostu dedanik?
            think Q AUX          money I.ERG steal AUX.enik
           'Do you think that I stole the money?' [de Rijk 1972:170]
        b. J akin dok ezkontzen               gareanik?

           'Did you know (anything about the fact) that we are getting mar-
          ried?' [Arejita 1984:83]Furthermore, the same may happen when the subordinate clause is itself in-
terrogative, provided there is a yes-no matrix question or a governing ne-
gated verb; in this case, we find -enik instead of the more general -en:(1477) a.   Badakizu    zuen   laguna    datorren    astean
            ba.know     your   friend    next        week.LOC

            Ί don't even know when you will arrive.' [de Rijk 1972:170]Nonetheless, despite the last two appearances (as complement to a yes-no
question, and as alternative to interrogative -en in either negative contexts
or yes-no questions), the most common syntactic environment for -enik is as
the head of a declarative complement to a negated governing verb.","[674, 675, 676]"

4.4.6.1.2. Yes/no questions and fociFoci may occur inside yes/no questions. In these cases, as usual, foci must
occupy the pre-verbal position.","[525, 526]"
"In yes/no questions, negation and the auxiliary appear in the left-periphery,
as in declarative clauses. Optionally, the yes/no question particle al occurs
in between the two:(1086) Ez (al) da       Xabier etorri?
       not Q     AUX Xabier come
       'Didn't Xabier come?'",[552]

plements of nouns denoting question events:

         b. *[Nor ez den etorri\ galderari]...",[554]
"The preceding sentence is acceptable as a yes/no question on the matrix
verb galdetu 'ask', but not as a direct wh-question about nola 'how'. How-
ever, the same pied-piping structure is possible if the wh-word is empha-
sized. In that case the whole sentence is not a direct question: the embedded
clause is not behaving as a single interrogative constituent, but as a single
focalized element:(918) Liburua NORK          idatzi duen         galdetu         dit    Jonek.
       book      who.ERG write AUX.COMP ask                     AUX    Jon.ERG
      'It is WHO wrote the book that Jon asked me.'",[518]
"4.4.7. Focalization and interrogation in negative clauses4.4.7.1. Negative questionsNegative wh-questions are formed in the same way as positive questions:
the wh-word will occur immediately to the left of the tensed verbal form.
However, when the latter is an auxiliary, it will appear displaced to the left
of the clause, away from the position to the right of the participle it occupies
in positive sentences (see 4.5). Indirect negative wh-questions are formed in
the same way, differing only in that their tensed verbal form is marked with
the complementizer -n:(992) Nork        ez du       ulertu       esan             dudana?
        who.ERG   not AUX understand say                   AUX.COMP.DET
       'Who did not understand what I said?'",[533]
"
3.5.7. Modal particlesA small set of particles can be attached immediately to the left of the tensed
verbal form (whether auxiliary or synthetic verb) to modulate and validate
the information conveyed by the clause: omen 'hearsay information', ei
'hearsay information; Bizk.', bide 'apparently', al 'yes/no question; desid-
erative', ote 'rhetorical question'. These particles are mutually exclusive for
any single verb:(455) Egia osoa         jakin    omen        du.
      truth whole know apparently AUX
      'He has apparently found out the whole truth.'",[346]
"Such construction is totally impossible in western dialects. It is not clear
whether this pattern represents a different strategy or whether it corresponds
to constituent negation. See Lafitte (1944) and Oyha^abal (1985).
   Negative yes/no questions are not marked in any special way other than
the presence of the negative particle ez. The yes/no interrogative particle al
and the northern yes/no complementizer -a may be found in these negative
questions:(996) Ez         al gara lagun           handiak?
         not     Q    are     friend   great.DET.PL
        'Aren't they great friends?' [Atx. Ob.: 143](997) Ez         al zaizu poeta        haundi     bat     iruditzen?

        'To do and undo everything, isn't that this world's law?' [Etch. Id.
        1:336]Indirect negative yes/no questions differ from direct ones in that auxiliary
preposing is not obligatory. This correlates with the tendency towards verb-
final orders in positive indirect yes/no questions:(999) a.        Galdetu dit       ea ez zaion             poeta haundi
                ask        AUX ea not AUX.COMP poet               great

4.4.7.2. Focalization in negative clausesJust like wh-words, foci may appear immediately to the left of the tensed
verbal form. The focalized constituent is pronounced with contrastive stress:(1000)    JONEK       ez   du        eskaera   sinatu.
          Jon.ERG not AUX petition             sign

          proposal      my    favor.in    came.because
         'That is why I did not reply to my friends, because their proposal
         was beneficial to me.' [Atx. Ob.:77]This focus is interpreted outside of the scope of negation: in the first exam-
ple above, we identify Jon as the person about whom the presupposed nega-
tive statement not sign the petition is true. Similarly, in the following exam-
ple, a reason is identified that explains why the event answering my friends
did not take place. Thus, continuations like the following are unfelicitous:(1002)     #JONEK ez du eskaera sinatu, Peruk baizik.
         'JON did not sign the petition, but Peru.' (cf. [1025])(1003)    #HORREGATlK ez        nien     lagunei   arrapostu,   beste    arrazoi

          one.because but
         'That is why I did not reply to my friends, but because of another
         reason.'","[534, 535]"
"
4.4.6.1. Clausemate operatorsThis section examines sentences where more that one operator (focal or in-
terrogative) occur in the same clause. Cooccurrence of foci with wh-words
and focalization in yes/no questions will be dealt with in turn.",[525]
"The adjacency phenomena described above for foci and wh-words are fairly
conspicuous and recognized in traditional grammars of Basque. The behav-
iour or foci is sometimes claimed to be less strict than normative grammar
suggests, especially in narrative or discursive contexts (Michelena 1978,
Villasante's 1979 preface to the second edition of Altube 1929). It has also
been mentioned that the situation may be different depending on the dia-
lects. With respect to the former remark, de Rijk (1996) has pointed out that
special effects obtained in narration by 'breaking' focalization rules presup-
pose the existence of such rules. As to the latter, dialectal differences will
certainly occur, but in the absence of detailed and reliable studies of focal-
ization in most dialects, this is a fairly impressionistic criticism. In-depth
studies from this perspective only exist for western dialects, where the fo-
calization strategies described below are generally held to be more robust:
Hualde et al. (1994) in fact describes a dialect with a more strict, rather than
looser, focalization system. In any event, the focalization (and certainly
question formation) strategies described in this chapter are generally re-
spected in conversational style in western dialects, and, more or less con-
sciously, in the standard written language. Section 4.4.8 below will present
some less standard patterns. Except where indicated otherwise, the gram-
matical system which will be described in this chapter corresponds to an
464 Syntax
educated standard central variety of the language close to Northern High
Navarrese (Iran).
   In order to emphasize the essential similarities between focalization and
question formation, we will be discussing the two processes simultaneously.
Thus, we will consider wh-questions and non-verbal focalization under the
same heading (section 4.4.2), and include yes/no questions and wh-
questions, in a different joint section (section 4.4.3). Subconstituent ques-
tion and focalization will be the topic of section 4.4.4, where different pied-
piping possibilities are mentioned for operators inside different non-clausal
phrases. On the other hand, questions and focalization of elements inside
embedded clauses is discussed separately in section 4.4.5, whether the op-
erator originating in an embedded clause is maintained there, as in indirect
questions, or moved to a different higher clause. Since both foci and inter-
rogative elements seem to vie for the same pre-verbal 'position', an obvious
question which emerges is whether two or more wh-words, foci, or combi-
nation thereof are compatible, and this issue is addressed in section 4.4.6.
The special problems associated with focalization in negative clauses will
be examined in section 4.4.7. Finally, section 4.4.8 will deal with cases
where foci or wh-words occur in a position other than the immediately pre-
verbal one.","[493, 494]"
"
2.3.1.2.1. Main prosodic and pragmatic prominenceTraditional grammarians such as Azkue (1931, 1932) and Al tube (1934) de-
scribed the word preceding the verb as the most prominent element in a sen-
tence, both prosodically and pragmatically. That is, the word preceding the
verb is perceived by speakers as the most prominent, or 'stronger' than the
rest of the words in the utterance. At the same time, Azkue and Altube iden-
tified this word, or the phrase it is contained in, as 'the most important piece
of information' in a sentence. This word or phrase could be the element con-
stituting the answer to the interrogative pronoun in questions such as 'What
happened?' or 'Who gave you the book?', for example. This is illustrated in
the question-answer pairs in examples (4) through (6) below. The most
prominent or focalized constituent appears in boldface:
                                                                  Intonation   77

"
2.3.3.2. Intonational division of an utteranceOne important word-order feature that distinguishes the variety of Baztan
from the varieties of Tolosa and Lekeitio is that main prosodic prominence
can appear postverbally more frequently in Baztan than in the other two va-
rieties. When the whole utterance is new information, not only in narratives
but also as an answer to a question such as 'What happened?\ the constitu-
ent with the most prominent pitch accent appears postverbally. Thus, an an-
swer to the question 'What happened?' could be the one in (57):
                                                                         Intonation   109

also have been placed in between the neg+auxiliary unit and the participle.
The third sentence provides an example of a tenseless negative question.
Some dialects occasionally admit negative questions where no split between
the auxiliary and the main verb takes place. Such uninverted negative ques-
tions have a rhetorical flavor. The 'unbroken' negative pattern was more
widespread in older stages of the language.
504 Syntax
   Eastern dialects possess an alternative strategy, whereby only the auxil-
iary is preposed and the negative element appears joined with the participle:(995) Nork             du      liburua     ez     irakurri?
         who.ERG       AUX book            not    read
        'Who hasn't read the book?'","[533, 534]"
"Some dialects possess overt morphological markers for yes/no questions,
such as G al or eastern (LN, Z, R and Sal), -a; the former is a verbal particle
(3.5.7), while the latter occupies the same position as complementizers
(3.5.7.3). -a is restricted to direct questions, while al may also be found in
embedded contexts:(819)    Gure literaturak       aurrerakada   haundirik  egin    al

ticular verb fronting:

rogative particle al as well as the yes/no marker -a. As usual, a clause-initial
verb may be preceded in turn by any number of topicalized/scrambled ele-
ments and a focalized constituent. Since subjects tend to be topics and ob-
jects are often focalized (see Hualde et al.1994), this means that it is not
clear whether SOV sentences like the following exclusively involve inter-
rogative intonation on a neutral word order or whether the object has been
focalized:(824) Baina       entzuleak       egilearen      esan-rtahi    berbera
        but       listener.ERG    author.GEN     meaning       same

synthetic verbs. These are clitic-like elements which lean on the element to
their left and which cannot therefore occur in absolute initial position in a
main clause. Where verb-fronting to that position takes place, they are sup-
plemented by the particle ba to their left:(826)    Ba al dugu musikan euskal         eskolarik?
         ba al have music.in Basque school.PRTT
        'Do we have any Basque school in music?' [Mitx. EIG 1:49](827) Ba      al   duzue    idazlanik            aski?
         ba   al   have     manuscript.PRTT    enough
        'Do you have enough manuscripts?' [Mitx. EIG 1:83]Topics may occur to the left of the initial verb, which will then also appear
with ba- (828); however, this is not the case if a focalized constituent pre-
cedes it: that constituent 'counts' as first element to support the synthetic
verb, as in (829):(828) Euskal doinuek       ba al dute        berezkotasunik?
       Basque songs.ERG ba al have peculiarity.PRTT
      'Do Basque songs have any peculiarities?' [Mitx. EIG 1:48](829)   Kaltegarritzat     al daukazue   joera           hori?

        'Do you consider that tendency harmful?' [Mitx. EIG 1:86]
4.4.3.2. Verb FocalizationVerb focalization stands out from the main focalization strategy described
in the preceding sections in that it seems to employ, at least in part, different
mechanisms. Since Altube (1929), a distinction has been drawn between
two types of 'verb focalization': a) cases where the event itself is empha-
sized, contrasting it with other type of events, and b) cases where 'the posi-
tive or negative quality of the verb is emphasized', i.e. where what is em-
phasized is that the action or state did take place or is true, as opposed to not
taking place or not being true. A priori, the contrastive overtones of the for-
mer seem more akin to the types of constituent focalization discussed in
section 4.4.2, while positive verbal emphasis falls fully in line with the
yes/no questions discussed in 4.4.3.1 However, both types of verb focaliza-
470 Syntax
tion will be discussed in this section in order to prevent dispersion and to
facilitate a sharper distinction between the two. Contrastive event focaliza-
tion will be dealt with in 4.4.3.2.1, and 4.4.3.2.2 will be devoted to polar
emphasis. Since negation presents additional problems which will be exam-
ined in section 4.4.7 below, we will concentrate here on positive polar em-
phasis.","[497, 498, 499, 500]"
"Like in Lekeitio and Tolosa, pronominal questions do not have a higher
pitch range than declaratives. The interrogative pronoun is the most promi-
nent word in the utterance, after which there is a big drop in pitch level, and
the rest of the utterance has a reduced pitch range, close to the speaker's
baseline. Following pitch accents are almost imperceptible. This can be ob-
served in Fig. 31, the F0 contour of the wh-question in (60):(60)   Norena                da       liburu       au?

"It is worth pointing out that aux-fronting in negative clauses is also far less
common in adjunct clauses, ranging from impossible in relatives to only op-
tional in many others (explicatives, conditionals, etc.); in fact the contexts
of lack of obligatoriness of aux-fronting in negatives coincide to a large ex-
tent with those in which egin and ba are less common. It is precisely in rela-
tives, which are obligatorily verb final, that these strategies are more
marked. If the latter, as suggested above, also involve fronting to the left of
the clause, the difficulty might be in verb fronting in those contexts in gen-
eral.

4.4.5.1.2. Indirect questionsAll indirect questions may be marked by the coftiplementizer -n, attached to
the conjugated verbal form. If true questions (as opposed to semiquestions),

preceded by scrambled material. Some examples will be given in

"    Pronominal questions present a similar pattern to the one found in
Lekeitio, that is, they have falling intonation at the end (like absolute inter-
rogatives and declaratives), and do not have a higher pitch range than de-
claratives. The interrogative pronoun is the most prominent word in the ut-
terance, and the peak for the interrogative pronoun reaches F0 values which
are higher than a word in a declarative sentence would reach in the same po-
sition, i.e., (usually) at the beginning of the utterance. This means that pro-
nominal questions have a bigger pitch range at the beginning. After the in-
terrogative pronoun there is a big drop in pitch level, and the rest of the
                                                                   Intonation   107
Figure 27.utterance has a reduced pitch range, such that following accents have very
small peaks.
    As in Lekeitio, among younger speakers of Tolosa Basque it is possible
to find pronunciations of interrogative sentences with final raising intona-
tion, probably influenced by Spanish.
    Repeat or echo-questions in Tolosa present similar features to those de-
scribed above for Lekeitio Basque in 2.3.1.3.3. They have an overall high
pitch level, which in absolute echo-questions is maintained throughout the
utterance. At the end there is a slight final lowering. As for exclamatives
and exhortatives, these types of utterances present the same basic character-
istics described for Lekeitio above.
    As pointed out in section 2.3.1.3.5, in most European languages continu-
atives or unfinished utterances are characterized by a final rising intonation.
Although in Lekeitio this does not hold, in Tolosa we observe final raising
at the end of adverbial clauses and topic phrases separated from the rest of
the utterance by a pause or strong juncture. This pattern is illustrated in Fig.
28, for sentence (56).","[136, 137]"
"Some negated main verbs such as uste 'think' also allow partitives inside
their complement clauses, as do inherently negative verbs like debekatu
'forbid', ukatu 'deny', etc. See 4.10.1.1.4 for complement clauses marked
partitive. 'Negation' must be understood here in a loose way, since formally
                                                            The noun phrase   125
positive sentences containing semantically negative adverbs such as nekez
'hardly', gutxitan 'seldom' may also license partitive phrases.(b) Complements of 'affective' predicates such as arraroa izan 'be strange,
    funny', harrigarria izan 'be surprising', harritu 'amaze', gaitza izan 'be
    hard', ebitatu 'avoid', sentitu 'be sorry' admit partitive phrases.(c) Interrogative clauses. Main and embedded yes-no questions are typical
    contexts where partitive expressions are found:(84) Behar dugu ogi-rik?
      need AUX bread.PRTT
      'Do we need any bread?'","[154, 155]"
"This strategy corresponds to the equivalent negative question structure men-
tioned in 4.4.7.1. See references quoted there.",[537]
"In the same manner, (23) could represent the prosodic pattern of a sentence
with wide focus or completely new information, or a sentence where only
etxia 'the house' were the focalized constituent. To express focus on the
genitive rephrasing would be required; e.g.: semienä ikusi dot Ί have seen
the one of the son'.
   Interestingly, multiple foci type of questions would not constitute triggers
of multiple prosodic prominence in this case. Thus, the correct answer to
86     Phonology
(25) is (26) (=[23]), not (27). This indicates that it is not possible to have
more than one word with prosodic prominence within a phrase:(25) Es tot entendidu. Noren                                       sir ikusi dosu?
     not AUX understand whose                                      what see AUX         Ί haven't understood. Whose what have you seen?'","[115, 116]"
"2.3.1.3.3. Echo-questionsThe main characteristic of echo-questions is their overall high pitch level. In
absolute echo-questions, after the word with main prominence (i.e., the
word which in the original declarative utterance that is being repeated had
main prominence) the fall in pitch is not the same as in declaratives or abso-
lute interrogatives, and the high pitch level is maintained throughout the ut-
terance (cf. Fig. 16, illustrating the contour for sentence 43). Indeed, in
some speakers' utterances there is no fall after the word that would have
main prominence in the declarative, even if the word is accented, and the
pitch level is high throughout. The high pitch level is maintained until the
end, when final lowering applies, and by virtue of the combination of the
high pitch level and final lowering even unaccented words ending an echo-
question appear as if they were assigned a pitch accent (cf. Fig. 16). Length-
ening of final syllables also applies in absolute echo-questions, like in their
non-echo counterparts:

"Wh-questions occasionally licence partitive phrases; however, more than
genuine questions these are rhetorical expressions which negate what they
formally inquire about:(85) Nola eros     auto-rik diru-rik      gäbe?
     how buy.RAD car.PRTT money.PRTT without
     'How can one buy a car without any money?'(d) The previous example also shows that it can optionally be attached to an
    object of the postposition gäbe 'without'; see also besterik gäbe 'with-
    out anything else', 'without further ado'.(e) Some speakers allow partitives in existential sentences (as in [a]; note
    the singular verb-form). This seems to be possible especially when an
    adjective modifies the head noun. An emphatic existential interpretation
    is also found with partitives used with non-existential predicates (b), (c):(86) a. Bada hemen neska ederr-ik.

    mon phrase eskerrik asko 'many thanks'. Nouns modified by superlative
    adjectives can also appear in the partitive. See section 3.1.3.3.

"
4.4.6. Wh- and focus compatibilitySince wh-words and non-verbal foci may occupy the pre-verbal position, it
is important to consider whether, in general, focalization is compatible with
interrogation. We will address this issue first with respect to focaliza-
tion+interrogation inside a single clause, turning later to examine the com-
patibility of the two in different clauses of the same sentence. Multiple
questions and multiple foci will be considered in section 4.4.6.3.",[525]
"These examples are well-formed in Basque. In both cases, the wh-word is
moved to the preverbal position, but along with it the whole NP in which the
relative is included has to move. Observe that in the examples (1896-1898)
the relative clause itself is not a question. The wh-word has scope over the
whole clause.",[816]
"
4.1.2. Intransitive monovalent structures4.1.2.1. Simple existenceThe simplest intransitive monovalent structure in Basque is constituted by
the verb izan 'be' as a lexical verb, in statements of existence:(500) Izan ala ez izan, horra              auzia.
       be    or not be           here.to question
      'To be or not to be, that's the question.'

"   Pronominal questions also have an overall high pitch level, but unlike ab-
solute echo-questions there is a clear and sharp fall after the interrogative
pronoun carrying main prominence. Another characteristic of pronominal
echo questions is that they are pronounced with final raising intonation (cf.

"This happens only with eta and when the agreement with the verb is plural.
It must be noted that it is not obligatory to take the question word as third
person for agreement purposes.
   The examples in (2126) illustrate another kind of structure where ques-
tion words appear as conjuncts:(2126) a. Norekin   eta Joxerekin etorri naiz.

The question word is always the first element in the coordination and both
conjuncts must have case endings.
   In questions with the disjunctive coordinators, we have the possibility of
not specifying the second conjunct:(2127) a. Nora      zoaz,   zinemara       ala?
          where     go      cinema, to     or

"Tenseless indirect questions are formed by placing the perfective participle

2.3.1.3.2. Pronominal (or Wh-) interrogative sentencesLike absolute interrogatives and declaratives, pronominal questions present
a falling intonation at the end. Unlike absolute interrogatives, they do not
have a higher pitch range than declaratives, however, and do not have longer
final syllables. The interrogative pronoun is always accented, and is the
most prominent element in the utterance. After the interrogative pronoun
there is a big fall in pitch level, and the pitch range is reduced, such that fol-
lowing lexical pitch accents have almost imperceptible peaks. This is also
                                                                  Intonation   95

4.4.6.3. Multiple questions and multiple foci
This section examines the possibility of finding more than one wh-word or
focus in the same clause (4.4.6.3.1) or in different clauses (4.4.6.3.2).",[527]
"   The only exception to this pattern would be cases of multiple foci, where
the sentence is uttered as a response to a question with two inquired ele-
ments. For instance, to a question such as (20) one could respond as in (21),
with the two words in different phrases having almost the same kind of
prominence. It is important to point out that the first word, i.e., the subject
Aitorrek is lexically unaccented but receives an accent in these circum-
stances:(20) Es tot    entendidu.
     not AUX understand.
     Ί haven't understood.
                                                                  Intonation 85
      Nok         nori       emon dotzo dirua?
      who.ERG     who.DAT give       AUX      money
      Who has given the money to whom?'","[114, 115]"
"However, the questioned complement may not cooccur with a degree word,
and must be detached from the rest of the phrase to occupy the preverbal
position. This option is not available for genitive modifiers:(874)    *Zeren       oso hurbil        dago?
          what.GEN very close           is
        'What is he very close to?'",[508]
"
4.5.4. Negative constituents4.5.4.1. Negative polarity itemsNegative polarity items in Basque are built on words which are homony-
mous with the question words, by the addition of a prefix e- (>i- by dissimi-
lation) (Michelena 1985[1961]: 67, 304), probably related to negation ez
'in-, not, no' (3.1.6.1.4):(1149) a. i-nor           'anybody'
       b. i-noiz         'ever'
       c. i-non          'anywhere (location)'
       d. i-nora         'anywhere (direction)'
       e. e-zer          'anything'
       f. e-zein + Ν     'any n' (literary)Although these polarity items seem to incorporate morphologically a nega-
tive element, for most speakers, they don't have a negative value by them-
selves. They need the presence of an independent clausemate negation, as
shown by the contrast in (1150):
                                                                   Negation   541
(1150) Zer   ekarri duzu? Ezer                 *(ez).
       what bring AUX        anything           not
       'What did you bring? Nothing.'","[570, 571]"
" Verb glosses
Verbal inflection in finite verbal forms is also glossed in detail only where
 directly relevant. Since the only relevant information, outside the chapter on
 verbal morphology itself, is person agreement (including person, case and
number morphemes) only that information is specified. Unless PL 'plural' in
explicitly marked, 'singular' is the default value. We have tried to represent
person agreement information in the order in which it appears on the verb.
Thus, subjects will be variously marked to the right or to the left, depending
on whether they are cross-referenced by the ergative or the absolutive
marker. Person morphemes are separated by slashes from each other in
pluripersonal agreement forms. Mood is only marked when the potential or
hypothetical marker -ke is present or when the subjunctive auxiliary is se-
lected, if directly relevant. Where none of this is relevant, only 'AUX' has
been indicated. Full information is given in 3.5.2.
    As for aspect information, following Basque grammatical tradition, we
gloss perfective participles as infinitives. This is so because they work as
the unmarked, citation form of the verb. Thus, a form like hartu is glossed
as 'take'. Similarly, the future morpheme -ko is added to this citation, parti-
cipial form, and we gloss hartuko as take.FUT, disregarding again the 'per-
fective' aspect marker -tu-. The auxiliary izan 'be' reinforcing perfective
tenses (3.5.4.2.1) or inserted to provide a verbal host for aspectual markers
in verbal locutions (3.5.4.2.2) is always glossed as 'be' regardless of its
grammatical function.
    The perfective present form ikusi dut can be translated as a present per-
fect of simple past in English. Both translations are given for this tense
throughout the grammar. The different tense values are described in 3.5.4.
Finally, some verbal expressions can be analyzed as regular verb+auxiliary

combinations or as noun/adjective + 'be, have' periphrases: bizi naiz Ί live,
be alive', nahi dut Ί want, have desire'. We have maintained the different
authors' preferences in this area.

                             Introduction
                                J. I. Hualde1.1. The Basque language and its nameThe word 'Basque' derives, through French, from the name of the Vas-
cones, a nation or tribe that in Roman times occupied an area of the Iberian
Peninsula including most of present-day Navarre and neighboring parts of
Aragon. Whereas, on the one hand, possibly not all Vascones were Basque-
speaking (both non-Indo-European Iberian and Indo-European Celtiberian
appear to have been used in parts of their territory) and, on the other hand,
Pre-Basque and related languages seem to have been also spoken by some
other neighboring nations (at least the Aquitanians in Gaul, see Gorro-
chategui 1995), in medieval times the name Vascones became identified
with the speakers of the direct ancestor of the language we know as Basque.
The traditional name for the Basque language in Spanish is vascuence, de-
rived from Latin uasconice '(to speak) in the Vasconic way', which is paral-
lel to and was opposed to romance < romanice 'in the Roman way'. In post-
Renaissance Spain, the name vizcaino, strictly speaking only the western-
most dialect of Basque, became for several centuries a frequent designation
for the Basque language and its speakers.
    The Basques call their language euskara (and dialectal variants: euskera,
eskuara, iiskara, auskera, etc.). Euskara is opposed to erdara (or erdera)
'foreign language', used to refer to Spanish on the southern side of the po-
litical border and to French on the other side. Both words have an ending
which very likely derives from the word era 'manner', used as a suffix in
many words, such as ibilera 'way of walking' (from ibil-i 'to walk'), etc. In
erdara the first element appears to be erdi 'half. Etymologically erdara
would thus be 'a half way of speaking', 'something that is not fully a lan-
guage'; a not unusual way to characterize a foreign language. On the other
hand, the original meaning of the root eusk- in euskara is less clear. Among
the proposed etymologies we find the name of the Ausci, a Pyrenean tribe in
Roman times, and the reconstructed verb *enau(t)s-i 'to speak' (Irigoyen
1977, 1990).
2 Introduction
    Basque speakers refer to the land where their language is spoken as
Euskal Herria (euskal = compositional form of euskara + herri 'country' +
-a 'singular determiner') 'country of the Basque language' and to them-
selves as euskaldunak 'those who have the Basque language' (euskal- +
-dun 'possessing' + -ak 'plural determiner').
   In the first decades of the 20th century, the eminent Basque politician and
not-so-eminent philologist Sabino Arana Goiri (1865-1903) and his follow-
ers changed the spelling to euzkera in the (mistaken) belief that this word
must be related to eguzki (dialectal euzki) 'sun', on the Classical Greek
model that sought a connection between Hellen and helios. Related coinages
of that vintage are the words Euzkadi 'Basque Country', later reformed as
Euskadi, the adjective euzko (later eusko) 'Basque, in an ethnic or political
sense' and euzkotar (later euskotar) 'Basque citizen; ethnic Basque'. The
truly great and very influential Basque linguist Luis Michelena (in Basque
Koldo Mitxelena) promoted the use of some of these neologisms to preserve
the traditional link between euskal and the Basque language. His wish was
to avoid the misuse of words like euskaldun, which traditionally can only
mean 'Basque speaker', as 'Basque citizen'. He succesfully campaigned for
terms like Eusko jaurlaritza 'Basque government' instead of Euskal jaur-
laritza, which in the Sprachgeflihl of traditional Basque speakers could only
mean something like 'Government of the Basque language' (see Michelena
1984).","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]"
"    In elliptical negative sentences the use of ez 'no' after ere is obligatory:
Jon ez da herrira joango bihar eta ni ere ez 'Jon will not go to the village
and neither will I'; zuk ez dakizu eta nik ere ez 'you don't know it and nei-
ther do I'. Alternatively, the expression baita (affirmative, < bai eta) or ezta
(negative, < ez eta) precedes the modified element and ere follows it in el-
liptical sentences: baita ni ere Ί do too' (= ni ere bai)] ezta Jonek ere 'nei-
ther does Jon' (= Jonek ere ez)', baita guri ere 'also to us' (= guri ere bai).
Being a clitic, ere can not constitute an utterance by itself. On the other
hand, baita (ere) and ezta (ere) can be used as answers to questions: Jon
etorriko da, eta zu? — Baita (ere) 'Jon will come, and you? — I will too';
Jonek ez du egingo, eta zuk? - Ezta (ere) 'Jon will not do it, and you? — I
won't either'.
   There is a discontinuous expression ez ezik... ere 'not only...but also':

      inside    not.only outside also was                people much
      'Not only inside, but also outside there was a lot of people.'","[357, 358]"
"In (1896) the wh-word is extracted from the subjunctive complement, and
the example is perfect. This is not the case in (1895), because the wh-word
is extracted from the relative included within the complex NP.
    However, provided there is no extraction, NPs within relatives can be
question words. In this case pied-piping (4.4.5.3) is obligatory:
