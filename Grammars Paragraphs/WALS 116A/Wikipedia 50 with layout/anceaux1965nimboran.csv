"   More intricate is the question of sand h. No minimal pairs are
found showing the opposition between these consonants. And not only
that, but some words having s occur side by side with words having
the same meaning and the same form except for h instead of s. These
cases are:
     semit3 and hemit3 - food
     sne and hne - breathless, panting
     setJgo and het3go - only

"   Morphology is concerned with those words which show a partial
similarity in form and in meaning, in so far as their partial differences
in form and meaning show a systematic character. As there appears
to be a good deal of misunderstanding with regard to this matter, we
have to enter, at least, into the basic principles.
   In many languages, including Nimboran, groups of words are found
which show a partial similarity in their forms and also have a common
element in their meanings, whereas each of these words can be opposed
to one or more other words from which they are differentiated by
precisely the same formal and semantic element. Such groups we call
m 0 r p hoi 0 g i c a I cat ego r i e S.l The formal feature(s), shared
by the members of a category, need not be absolutely uniform but may
show some variation, provided that this variation is defined by the
phonemical shape of the word and, therefore, is predictable. If differ-
ences are found which are unpredictable, the words in question do not
belong to one category.",[61]
"   All these forms follow the rules, so far established, except for the
tense-morpheme which is -r- in all these forms instead of -d-. As this
appears to be the case with all members of these Position categories,
we state the rule that the morpheme, characterizing the Future category,
is -d- in members of the First Position category and -r- in members
of the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Position categories.
   Side by side with the forms of the Fourth Position category, e.g.
'I3guasaru etc. and 'I3guasaku etc., we find forms in which the s is
replaced by h as free variants: 'I3guaMru, 'I3guaMku etc. But these
h-alternants only occur if the consonant in question immediately follows
the root-morpheme and immediately precedes a vowel which has an
accent and is followed by at least one consonant which is not word-
final. As we shall see later on, these conditions are usually fulfilled
only in the Singular forms of Future and Past.",[77]
"  In such cases the meaning is ""get into the state (which is denoted
by the lexical meaning)"".
  In § 46 we saw that Infinitives may have the function of adjectives.
In other words, the Infinitive form is a means to make verbs into
adjectives. As those members of the category in question which have
corresponding forms in the verbal categories, enumerated above, always
have the form of the Infinitive as the form of their root-morpheme, it
may be said that the Infinitive is the connecting link between that
category and the other categories. The other members which correspond
with adjectives only make it clear that this has something to do with
the adjectival function of the Infinitive.
  For this reasons we call this category a Secondary verbal category
and, as it is not the only one of this kind, we call it the First Secondary
Verb Category.
  There is one series of forms, belonging to this category, viz.
   remedaru - I will change, become transformed (here),
      etc., etc.,
the root-morpheme of which (reme-) is not found otherwise.
  Moreover, all forms of this category occur with zero root-morpheme:
   daru or raru - I will become (here),
      etc., etc.",[131]
"   As has been said before, the members of a morphological category
show a common formal feature. This formal feature becomes apparent
from the comparison with morphologically related words (co-members
of morphological sets), belonging to other categories, e.g., English
worker vs. worked, walker vs. walked, etc. In this example there is
an opposition between words having one categoric morpheme (-er) and
words with a different categoric morpheme.
   However, in many cases the formal opposition is found in the
presence of a certain formal feature in the one case and its absence
in the other; e.g., English work and walk as opposed to working and6 In our morphological description we will regularly add a translation to the
  words under discussion. This translation usually contains only a superficial
  indication of the lexical meaning. A more detailed description of the meanings
  will be found in the vocabulary in the second volume.

  Roman Jakobson, p.568.

walking. In such cases we may speak of a z e rom 0 r p hem e with
those words which are characterized by the absence of a certain formal
feature. It is clear that this is just another way of saying that a certain
element of form is absent and that this absence determines the place
of the word, or words, in question within the morphological framework
of the language.
  In our discussion of Nimboran morphology we will time and again
come across cases which can be described with the term zero morpheme.
In some cases we will even have to speak of zero root-morpheme.","[63, 64]"
"  As the opposition between r and all consonants other than sand h
has been discussed in the §§ 1 to 9, here instances are given of minimal
pairs for the opposition between rand s, h, and zero only:     rao - sleep                     sao - drive away
     iru - bone dagger               isu - shake
     mare - unconscious              mase - vomit

11. s.
   s is a voiceless apico-dental grooved fricative (rill-spirant), occurring
word-initially and word-medially, e.g. sy - name, besam - unwilling,
skirj - ripe.
   It is in free variation with voiceless lamino-alveolar grooved fricative
[sY], if immediately followed by i, e.g. besib - bend, and at the same
time with voiceless lamino-domal grooved fricative [~Y], if immediately
followed by an i which has no accent and is immediately followed by
a vowel, e.g. denstarj - noon, insium - mouse, isiu - shake.

the opposition between s and the other consonants was shown in the
§§ 1 to 10, only the following examples are given here, demonstrating
the opposition between s and zero:
     siaflj - young man                    iaflj - ask
     skie - deep                           He - hand
     spou - undo                           pou - blow
     uso - tadpole                         uo - nest12. h.
  h is a voiceless glottal fricative, occurring word-initially and - only
in some verbal and pronominal forms and in some names - word-
medially. If wo·rd-initial and immediately followed by fIj or n, it may
be actualized as a voiceless nasal of the same point of articulation as
the following nasal, so [IJ] or [N] respectively; e.g. hfljari - bird of
paradise, hnaflj - louse, hnum - know.
   But many speakers (probably even a majority) never pronounce
word-initial h which is immediately followed by fIj, n, or r, and say ru
for hru - man, etc. Therefore one might say that these speakers have
zero as an allophone of h in this environment. But this reasoning would
do no justice to the fact that the speakers in question do not have any
opposition between words like:
     hnaflj - louse,                 and      naflj - straddle-legged,
     hno - a place-name.             and      no - he, she, they,
     hrao - carry,                   and      rao - sleep,so that for them these pairs of words are just homophonous forms,
whereas an opposition between them does exist for the other speakers.
In fact this a question of coexistence of an older 17 phase, in which
there is opposition between hflj- and fIj-, between hn- and n-, and
between hr- and r-, and a later phase, in which these oppositions do
not exist, so that more homophonous words are found. The line,
separating these two phases, lies in between individual speakers,1817 It is not without reluctance and only for want of better terms, that we
   introduce words like ""older"" and ""later"" here in our description. Still, we
   are fully convinced that, historically, these terms are right, all the evidence,
   produced by comparison with closely related languages, pointing in this
   direction.
18 We got the impression that the older phase is found mostly with older
   speakers, but the dividing line between the two phases certainly does not
   coincide precisely with difference of age.
26                        TIm NIMBORAN LANGUAGEalthough it is certainly not beyond possibility that the same speakers
use forms of both phases alternately.
   As the opposition between h and the other consonants, except s, has
been discussed in the §§ 1 to 10, it remains to speak of the opposition
between hand s and that between h and zero.
   As to the opposition between h and zero, just now we saw that in
certain environments this opposition is not found with all speakers.
The remaining cases of word-initial h are those in which h is immedi-
ately followed by a vowel. But words having initial h, immediately
followed by i, y, or u,19 do nOit occur, whereas words having initial
e, a, or 0 are very few in number, so that the possibility for minimal
pairs is extremely limited. The only instance found is that of hambot3 -
horn, and ambot3 - Ambon, Ambonese (a loanword). Another proof
for the existence of the opposition is given by the fact, that dropping
an initial h (which is immediately followed by a vowel) may affect
the recognizability of the word in question: the (non-existing) word
""ake"" would not be accepted by any speaker of Nimboran as being
identical with hake - torch, but is felt to be different.
   Instances of opposition between h and zero in word-medial position
are found in verb-forms, e.g.
     tet3gat3hake - you knocked there      tet3gat3ake - you knocked below.","[36, 37, 38]"
"16   La. comparison with related languages makes it very plausible that 9 originally
     was only an allophone of k. But this is a historical question which can be
     very well left out of discussion here, because now the relation between k and 9
     is different.

   and also if being word-initial and immediately followed bye, i, or y;
   e.g. emberekrise - maize, herikenum - purple, hri - go down, hrym -
   friend, ire - slanting, sloped, iryb - camouflaged hunting-box in a
   tree, reb - drink.
2° voiced apico-alveolar flap [r] in free variation with voiced apico-
   alveolar trill [r] in all other environments with preference for the
   flapped allophone, except if immediately preceded by k or g in
   which case the trilled allophone is preferred; e.g. narob - rubbish,
   hrap - shadow, iare - source, prirj - fly, krym - sound, pakrup - lid,
   cover, narjgrei - three.","[35, 36]"

"   In Nimboran, as in most languages, borrowing words from other
languages is an important means for enriching the vocabulary.
Especially in recent times, foreign cultural influence has been the
cause of many words being borrowed. The most important lending
language is the lingua franca, which is used - with some regional
variaDJts - in the coastal areas Oof western New Guinea. This language
we call New Guinea Malay (NGM), for want of a better tenn. This
NGM is not very much different frOom Bahasa Indonesia, the national
language of Indonesia, so that in many cases the question, if a word
was borrowed from NGM or from Indonesian, is utterly senseless.
For words, borrowed by Nimboran frOom other languages - among
which in the first place Dutch must be mentioned -, NGM often, but
not always, served as an intennediary. As Indonesian/Malay was
introduced in primary education already years ago, every Nimboran-
44                         THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGE
speaker has a certain knowledge of this language .and borrows words
from it freely, not only in high-flown speech-making and in technical
statements, but also in everyday conversation. Especially among the
younger generart:ion, garnishing the language with Malay jIndonesian
words is an established custom, even in those cases in which original
Nimboran words would be as good or even better.","[55, 56]"
"   If an Infinitive has initial u, this u is doubled in the corresponding
Final Infinitive, except if the initial It of the Infinitive is immediately
followed by a second u in which case the Final Infinitive has the same
shape as the Infinitive, e.g.
   uau - to rasp,                    uuau - in order to rasp,
   uo - to dibble,                   uuo - in order to dibble,
   uou - to row,                     uuou - in order to row,
   UU13 - to weed,                   uU13 - in order to weed,
   uuo - to answer,                  uuo - in order to answer.",[127]
"  The result of this limited occurrence of g is that minimal pairs,
showing the opposition between g and any other consonant, are of
extreme rarity. Instances of contrast in similar environment are more
easily found, e.g. ne13ki - his wife, be1'jgib - sea. An instance of opposition
with zero is 13ga13 - construct (a wall), vs. 13a13 - open (mouth).
  Yet there is no reason for the assumption that g is not a separate
phoneme, for it does not occur in complementary distribution to any
other speech sound and is not interchangeable with any other speech-
sound. This last statement seems to be contradictory to the fact that
some verb-forms occur with k as well as with g without any difference15   For a difficulty with such cases of opposition between k and g in verb-forms,
     see § 8.

 These, however, must be regarded as different fonus, as other verb-
 fonus, fully comparable with those in question, have g but never have k
 (d. the difference between fonus of the 1st and those of the 3d Position-
 Category in the § mentioned above),169. '3.
   1'3 is a voiced dorso-velar nasal; it occurs word-initially, word-
medially, and word-finally, e.g. fJare - myself, fJgYfJ - fall, indiofJeirum -
Jew's harp.
    I,t is fronted, if immediately followed by i or e or by a k or g which
is fronted because of an immediately following front vowel (see § 7
and § 8), and also if word-final and immediately preceded by i, e.g.
fJei - tear, rend, fJgfe - resin, fJgesi13 - wipe off, usf13 - say, tefjgeifJ - cut.
   If 1'3 is word-final and the immediately preceding vowel is a, this a
is nasalized [3.]. The same may happen to 0 or tt, if immediately
preceding a word-final 1'3, but then only as a free variant. With some
speakers word-final 13, preceded by a nasalized vowel, is practically
inaudible so th3Jt the 1'3 is mainly represented by the nasalized quality
of the preceding vowel. E.g. ta13gafJ - string, urafJ - long, temufJ -
remainder, SOfJ - mosquito.
   As the opposition between 1'3 and other consonants has been discussed
already in the preceding §§, we here give some instances of minimal
pairs for the opposition between 1'3 and r, s, h, and zero:     130 - I, we                           ro - wash
     13yei - stir                          syei - kind of fibre
     fJaio - father                        haio - kangaroo
     bMj - broken                          ba - far
     fJuaro13 - fibrous husk of            uarofJ - nail
                        coconut10. r.
   r is a voiced apico-alveolar vibrant; it occurs word-initially and
word-medially, e.g. karofJ - thorn, fJgrafJ - bumble-fly, kekruab - white,
rer£13 - push, shove.","[34, 35]"
"  Words, belonging to different morphological categories but corres-
ponding with each other in form and meaning, constitute a m 0 r-

phological set and those between members of a category are across
each other:

   preceding foot-note, and also: H. Schultink, De morfologische valentie van
   het ongelede adjectief in modern Nederlands, Den Haag, 1962, p. 11. In
   Schultink's book a lucid exposition is given of the consequences of the
   principles, laid down in Uhlenbeck's article, for morphological research. As
   our methods are along the same lines, it is enough for us to state briefly the
   outlines and to refer the reader to these two authors. Needless to say that
   for the presentation given here only the present author is responsible.

5 Here the same terminological difficulty arises as was found with the term
   ""morpheme"" (§ 2). An expression like ""basic morpheme"" might have been
   used instead of ""root-morpheme"". Bloomfield's term ""kernel"" has to general
   a meaning and his term ""stem"" we prefer to use in a different, more specializecl,
   meaning (cf. Language, p. 225 sqq.).

statement of a categoric meaning is often far from being a simple
matter, as the lexical meaning of the words in question may enter
largely into the establishment of the categoric meaning. The short
formulas we will use for indicating the categories are only meant as
practical labels. 7 The term ""categoric meaning"" will be used here for
the total, non- formal, value of membership of a category and so will
also include the conception of syntactic valence, discussed in the
preceding §. To avoid any misunderstanding, it must be added that
the meaning of a polymorphematic word can not be said to be the sum
total of lexical meaning plus categoric meaning(s); but these meanings
are somehow represented in the total meaning of the word.","[62, 63]"

3. How the materials were collected.
    The data for the present description were gathered in the years 1954
 to 1957. In the following years from time to time incidenta:1 additions
 were made. The way of collecting data was based on the assumption
 that '<lin accur<lite idea of the structure of a language can only be formed
 when the 'reseal'cher has acquired a sufficient degree of mastery - both
active and passive - of the language in question. This appeared to be
an exacting and timetaking affair, but was most remunerative. However,
even if the researcher learns to speak the language, he can ill dispense
with the help of informants, because otherwise he might stand in
 jeopardy of describing not the language itself but only tht part of it
whioh he has learned to use. On the other hand mastering the language
is a powerful means to the efficient use of informants.
    During ;these years so m<liuy people served as informants for the
r'esearch from which the present description has resulted, that it is
imposs~ble to mention all their names. But an exception must be made
£01' Dina N apo, an adolescent girl, who was a daily collaborator f'Or
years. She proved to possess an outstanding intelligence and a natural
gift for linguistic work whioh was not hampered by any preconceived
theory whilch might have made it less easy for her to look upon her
language with an open mind. Very soon she got a dear perception of
the how and why of linguistic research and helped to think out means
to discuss linguistic matters in her own language, showing great powers
of invention in coining grammatical terms -etc. Moreover, she had the
sense not only to check up - in a crafty, subtle way - doubtful points
wi,tIh other informants, but also to be constantly in search for exceptions3   See: H. K. J. Cowan, Notes on Sentani Grammar. Oceania, XXI (1950-1951),
    p. 214 sq.

fallacy of preliminary conclusions (the latter case receiving her prefer-
ential consideration I).
   Work with Dina and other informants in Hollandia was kept going
and supplemented by the results of periodical visits to the Nimboran
villages. During these stays usually no systematic procedures were
foUowed and most of the attenibion was given to the unconstrained, free-
and-easy, conversation of the villagers which always yielded pointts. for
further investigation. As a matter of fact, it would have been impossible
without observation on the spot to fonn an accurate idea of the
Nimboran people's environmenit, daily life, and culture and corres-
pondingly of the words of their language and ,the contents of their
conversation.
   Although collecting traditional tales was not entirely neglected, the
main object always was the study of the living language: detection of
the rules according to which the Nimboran language is spoken. 4
4   There is only one publication giving information on the Nimboran language,
    viz. : G. Schneider,Proben der Nimboran-Sprache. Zeitschrift fUr Eingeborenen-
    Sprachen, XVIII (1927-1928), p. 128-140. We mention this here only as
    a matter of curiosity, as it is the result of superficial observation and so full
    of errors that it is of very little use.

and their functions, we have to discuss a term whioh - although a
common notion in non-linguistic use - in many linguistic puhlications
is either purposely avoided or used without any definition or discussion:
the word. Our description is based on the standpoint that the Nimboran
language has wOf'ds as its sma!l1est independent meaningful units. As <this

points, reference may be made to the existing literature.1     In general, the word, as a linguistic unit, is characterized by:

2. isolability.","[16, 17, 18, 19]"

   In the preceding chapter we stated that every word has its specific
sound-form. These forms consist of sound-units which are called
phonemes. Phonemes differ from each other in distinctive features;
each phoneme may be considered as a bundle of such distinctive sound-
features.
   Phonemes are important means for ·!:'he identification of word-forms
through hearing. The determination of the role, played by any phoneme
in the recognizability of a word-form, is conditioned by several factors,
including the number of phonemes constituting the word,3 ,the existence
 (or non-existence) of other words which show a certain degree of
sim~larity in sound-form to the word in question, and the contribution
to the recognizability offered by the context or the situation. In the
practical use of language redundancy of means of identification is of
quite commOon occurrence. The distinctive value of phonemes, their
identificational function, reaches a maximum, when words are isolated
from any context. 4
   So the distinctive value of phonemes does not stand out clearly under
all circumstances. On the other hand not all phonemes are the same in
this respect, as they appear to show differences in their possibilities of
mutual combinability and in the places they can occupy in a word-form.
Consequen1'ly, some phonemes have much more chance of showing their
distinctive, identificational, value than other phonemes have. But the
mere fact that a sound-unit's possibilities of occurrence are limited,
need not be a reason for denying its phoneme-status. In the discussion
of1!he separate phonemes we will come across some instances of this sort.
   Our description of the phonetic characteristics of the phonemes will
be limited to tJhe way in which the sounds are produced. 5 Of course their
identificational function is connected with their acoustical qualities but,
as we are not able to make a description along these lines, we are forced
to co~fine ourselves to the articulatory characte6stics, as is indeed
common practice.","[19, 20]"
"    Members of this category are characterized by Actor morphemes
of the Apophonic series and an element -met3- immediately preceding
the Position morpheme or, if this is zero, the Tense morpheme or
I terative morpheme. This -mClj- never has an accent so that the Actor
morphemes of First Position forms all have an accent, e.g.   iamendy - I will ask (here),
   tekumentim - he meets (here),
   pebmefJkekCljyem - they two (non-masc.) call names below,
   uuimenskCkim - they answered there repeatedly.",[135]
"   Members of this category show the same forms as those of the -ma'3-
category except for their Actor morphemes which are of the Apophonic
series. Consequently, the vowel of the characterizing element is e.
  The members of this category are:
forms with the root-morphemes
   uu- - answer;
   ic£'3- - ask;
   teku- - meet;
Momentary forms with the root-morpheme u- that never has an accent
  and for which Plural forms have i-, also without accent, having the
  lexical meaning ""tell, say to"".",[151]
"   Together, they constitute a productive category. Their formal mark
is the absence of any categorial morpheme: they consist of a bare
root-morpheme. The common seman tical element is less easy to
describe. It appears that some heterogeneous semantical elements are
found side by side, distinguishable in the different cases in which the
forms in question are used:1° just the absence of all the other categorial meanings, in cases like:
   no po 1Jgua - he wants to bite,
   130 l3gua besam - I refuse to bite.2° a curt order: 1Jgua - bite! For a more polite order, a friendly request
   etc. the Second Person Future is used:
   l3guade - please, bite! have the goodness to bite!3° a state, caused by being submitted to the action, attributed to a noun:
   ndie hru me l3gua - that man is already bitten,
   hru l3gua be ndie - the bitten man is there.
   This use is the same as that of adjectives, e.g.:
   ndie hru krap6 - that man is bad,
   hru krap6 be ndie - the bad man is there.
   This category we call the category of the Infinitive.
   The indifference of Infinitive forms in regard to the other categories
is seemingly absent in cases like:
   tao - to put many objects,
   dao - to give (take) many objects,
   ,.au - to roast many objects,
   prei - to bring many objects,as these could be thought to be connected with the Plural Object
category. However, we must assume that these are Infinitives of verbs,
                               MORPHOLOGY                             113having the semantical element of ""many objects"" as part of their lexical
meaning. In the cases of tao, rau, and prei this becomes quite clear
from other forms which, without being Plural Object forms, still
possess the plural object-element in their meaning. The fact that tao,
dao, rau, and prei and words, morphologically related to them, are
used, by way of suppletion (see Ch. I, § 10), instead of the (non-
existing) forms of the Plural Object category of tey - put, tei - take,
give, dey (dy-) - roast, and a series of forms with zero root-morpheme
to which belongs rebedu - I will bring from here to above, respectively,
is not relevant, as the latter have no morphological connections with
the first.
   In the examples, cited above, the form of the Infinitive is the same
as that of the root-morpheme in its combinations with the various
morphemes but not the same as the special Singular or Plural stem,
found with some root-morphemes. This appears to be the case with
the great majority of Infinitive forms, e.g.:   nC13ga - to light (etc.),                 uo - to dibble (etc.),
   tC13ga13 - to knock (etc.),               sebuo - to sew (etc.),
   sam - to put inbetween (etc.),            trao - to lift (etc.),
   skye - to smoke (etc.),                   dou - to start (etc.),
   bie - to open (etc.),                     hru13 - to break (etc.),
   13gri13 - to draw, trail (etc.),          siab - to pour out (etc.),
   tC13gei13 - to cut (etc.),                peb - to peel (etc.),
   13gedey - to fasten (etc.),               pyb - to stick (etc.),
   temY1J - to stab (etc.),                  brub - to fold (etc.).","[122, 123]"
"  As with these three negative rules not everything is said, we still
have to survey the various consonant-sequences found. They will be
arranged under the heading of the first consonant.",[43]
"  Members of this category show the following formal characteristics:
1. all Actor morphemes are of the Apophonic series;
2. First +  Second Person Singular forms have an element -ke- im-
   mediately following the root-morpheme;
3. except for the First  +  Second Person forms, there is no formal
   difference for the number of the Actor;
4. all forms are characterized by an element -13- which in Momentary
   forms of the First Position category immediately precedes the
   Tense morpheme, in Iterative forms of the First Position category
   immediately precedes the Iterative morpheme, and in all other
   Position categories immediately precedes the Position morpheme;
                                          +
S. all forms, except those of the First Second Person Singular,
   have an i immediately following the last vowel of the root-morpheme,
   except with those root-morphemes which have a Plural stem
   without i;
6. all forms have an i immediately preceding the first vowel following
   either the root-morpheme or, in First   +   Second Person Singular
   forms, -ke-, if that vowel is preceded by d, t, n, or s.
  The members of this category are:
   forms with the root-morpheme uu- - answer;
   forms with zero root-morpheme and with the lexical meaning ""say
   to"" ;
   Singular and Plural forms with the root-morphemes ici13- - ask, and
   teku- - meet; for these two root-morphemes the Dual is blockaded
   by the -ri13- category (see under K.).

Some examples:
      uuindiy - I (we) will answer them (here),
      ia13isieki - you asked them there,
      tekukentiim - you and I meet them (here),
      indiy - I (we) will say to them (here),
      kementim - you and I say to them (here).","[161, 162]"
"   For these reasons word-final n may best be regarded as a normal
form of the phoneme n} although of limited occurence.
   n is in free variation with a voiced lamino-alveolar nasal [nY] , if
immediately followed by i} e.g. meni - other, some. The lamino-alveolar
allophone always occurs, if the n is immediately followed by the lamino-

that, ansi13 - come here!
   If n is immediately followed by an i which has no accent and is
immediately followed by a vowel, besides the lamino-alveolar allophone,
already mentioned, also a voiced lamino-domal nasal [1)'] occurs in
free variation, e.g. minie - before, iniom - middle. The lamino-domal
allophone always occurs, if n is immediately followed by the lamino-
domal allophone of t, d, or s (see § 11), intiym - screen, cover, indio -
mother, insium - mouse.
   As examples for the opposition between n and the bilabial consonants,
t, and d are given in the §§ 1 to 5, we here give some instances of
minimal pairs, showing the opposition between n and the other con-
sonants and zero:   nab - spirit                        kab - game
   mana - mythological name            mako - mode of procedure, custom
   no - he, she, it, they              130 - I, we
   na1'3 - louse                       1'3a1'3 - open (mouth)
   nasi1'3 - go away                   rasi1'3 - come into contact
   heni - ill                          heri - you will go
   nao - break                         sao - chase away
   nu - sight                          su - walk on!
   naku - yolk                         haku - areca-nut
   nanda1'3 - theft                    handa1'3 - try
   ndi - dream                         di - wood
   mensy - navel                       mesy - small bead
   nane - who?                         nae - sale7. k.   k is a voiceless dorso-velar stop, occuring word-initially and word-
medially, e.g. krom - grindstone, karey - quagmire, bciky - dance,
keikcio - narrow.
   k is slightly fronted, if it immediately precedes i or e, e.g. keki - raw,
He - hand, iakey - crumble.
   Word-initial k may be rather lax, if the word in question is syn-
tactically closely connected with the immediately preceding word and
the latter has a final vowel. e.g. di kekuye - bush, shrub.
   As examples for the opposition between k and the bilabial and
apico-dental consonants are found in the §§ 1 to 6, we here give some
22                           THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGE
minimal pairs, showing the opposition between k and the other con-
sonants and zero:

         peatedly throwing here                              throwing below 15
     ko - you                             130 - I, we
     ka13 - emaciated                     13a13 - open (mouth)

     iciky - buttocks                     iciy - uncle, aunt8. g.
   g is a voiced dorso-velar stop which is very much limited in its
combinabilirty with other phonemes. It is a bit fronted, if it is immedi-
ately followed by e or i, e.g. 13gesim - roll up, be13gib - sea.
g only occurs
      word-medially, preceded by 13 or - less frequently - by m, e.g.
      13gm - fall, bC1'Jga1'j - wasp, damg6u - yawn.
      word-initially in ge which never occurs sentence-initially and also
      otherwise is limited in its possibilities of occurrence (see Ch. VIII,
      § 3).","[32, 33, 34]"
" The members of this category are forms with the following root-
morphemes:

   Here we find members of a productive category, formally marked
by the element -re- which has its place immediately following the
root-morpheme except in those forms which contain the Dual mor-
pheme -ke- which then precedes the element -re- and takes the form -k-.
   The common semantical element can be described as ""the action is
connected with an object, consisting of one or two male beings, not
identical with the speaker or the person addressed"". If the object is
explicitly mentioned or not, does not make any difference for the use
of these -re- -forms. We call this category the category of the Mascu-
line Object.
   The Masculine Object forms of the Sixth to Sixteenth Position
categories answer fully to the description given above, e.g.:      pribrebedu - I will throw him from here to above,

"   Because - as will be shown clearly in our further description - the
form of the root-morpheme found in the Singular forms is much more
limited in its possibilities of occurrence than the form found in the
Dual forms, we take the latter as a norm for the root-morpheme.
   The form of the root-morpheme occurring in Singular forms we
call the Singular Stem of the root-morpheme. V.,r ether a root-morpheme
has a special Singular Stem or not, only depends from its phonemical
structure. The rule appears to be: All root-morphemes have the same
form in both Dual and Singular forms, except:

 in the §§ 1 to 4, we here give only some instances of minimal pairs
 showing ,the opposition between 0 and u and zero:      do - there                         du - child

      iduo - kind of frog                idu - flying-fox6.    u.
   u is a voiced high close back unrounded vocoid [i]; it occurs word-
initially, word-medially, and word-finally: udb - crawfish, umie -
crocodile, kuir6b - lightning, muo - make, ndnteku - day before
yesterday.
   u has a high open allophone, used - in all cases - by those speakers
who are in the habit of using the backed allophone of y (see § 4).
   A word-final u which has no accent and is immediately preceded
by 0, is actualized as voiced back dorsa-velar stop [G] by a minority
of speakers,14 e.g. [speG] for sp6u - unloosen.
   For examples for the opposition between u and other vowel-phonemes
the reader is referred to §§ 1 Ito S. The opposition between u and zero
is apparent from minimal pairs like the following:      bud - beat                         ba - far
      ir6u - kind of frog                ir6 - fill

2.    point of articulation,
3.    shape of articulator,
4.    impedance or exit type.",[21]

(see § 6), these two facts are obviously connected. The number of these
speakers can not be given; probably they are in a minority.
   If y has an accent and is immediately followed by i, it is less tense
and lowered to high open position, e.g. fJgetyidiu - we shall rub,
fJgedYikam - they atItached.
   As examples for the opposition between y and i, e, and a were given
in the §§ 1 to 3, we here only give instances of minimal pairs showing
the opposition between y and 0, u, and zero:     iy - bird                     i6 - we
     keby - hornbill               keb6 - netbag
     kYfJ - stoop                  kOfJ - set down
     iay - aunt, uncle             iao - on guard
     ky - faeces                   ku - time, day
     demye - dead                  demue - stone
     iary - strong (wind)          iaru - shoulder
     mey - cloud                   me - mother
     kay - a proper name           ka - out of the way there I
     krya - defecate               kra - hunt5. o.  o is a voiced mid back unrounded vocoid, occurring word-initially,
word-medially, and word-finally: opMmufJ - (at) first, SOfJ - mosquito,
teMo - fry, bake, kaiter6 - border.
  The allophones of this phoneme are:
1° voiced mid close back unrounded vocoid [e], if the 0 is word-final
   and has no accent, e.g. mo - sago, batO - wide, broad.
2° voiced mid open back unrounded vocoid, if the 0 has no accent
   and is immediately preceded by an u which has an accent, and
   also if the 0 has an accent and is immediately followed by a word-
   final consonant, e.g. sMo - crab, ibuo - pig, utOb - star, betOm -
   freckle, mole.
3° voiced low close black unrounded vocoid, if the 0 is immediately
   followed by an u which is immediately followed by a word-final
   consonant, e.g. ifJg6ufJ - prickly, nimbr6ufJ - squatting.","[25, 26]"

"  A morphological category may be productive or improductive. If a
category is improductive, new members can not normally be added,
and, consequently, its members can be enumerated.
  Productive categories, however, have no fixed number of members;
they represent a procede that may be extended over ever more words.
Such productive procedes provide a speaker with the morphological
means for forming new words, no matter wether he has heard these
words being used by other speakers or not. Investigating the ways in
which this is performed is the main subject of descriptive morphology.s7. The limits of productivity.",[64]

  If categories, belonging to the same system, show opposition and,
therefore, are mutually exclusive within one word, they are of the

order. A word may be a member of more than one category but never
belongs to two (or more) categories of the same order.

                           PREFACE
   During three years of linguistic research in \Vestern New Guinea
in the service of the Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volken-
kunde (Royal Institute of Linguistics, Geography and Ethnology, The
Hague), the writer had as his main task the study and analysis of a
hitherto undescribed language. \Vhen the choice fell on the Nimboran
language, it was not to be foreseen that this meant opening up a gold
mine of linguistic data. Indeed, the investigations, though often slow
and laborious, proved most rewarding. The amount of data was so
overwhelming that remoulding them into a complete description required
much time. Moreover, it was my wish to do more than just listing the
facts. From the outset, I tried to undig the generative aspect of the
linguistic structure. Therefore, the idea was not to compile a corpus
of data which could be analysed later on, but to find out what role
every element that was recorded could play in building new utterances.
This meant that the description was to be made along new lines. It
was only after years that I found the peace to complete this task. In
the near future I hope to add a description of Nimboran syntax, some
texts, and a vocabulary to the phonological and morphological parts,
embodied in the present volume.
   I owe a great debt of gratitude to the Koninklijk Instituut voor
Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde for both organizing the research and
publishing the results, and to the former Government of Netherlands
New Guinea and the Netherlands Organisation for the Advancement
of Pure Research (Z.W.O.) for liberally subsidizing the project.
   I am also deeply in debt to Dr. J. van Baal, then Governor of
Netherlands New Guinea, whose sympathetic and interested attitude
appeared most helpful, and to Mr. C. J. Grader and Dr. J. V. de Bruyn
of the Bureau of Native Affairs (Kantoor voor Bevolkingszaken) who
did very much in paving the way and taking charge of all sorts of
practical arrangements. Much help was also given by the District-
Officers, Dr. Vv'. J. H. Kouwenhoven and Mr. E. van Voskuylen.
VI                            PREFACE
   Warm thanks are also due to Dr. E. M. Uhlenbeck and Dr. H.
Schultink for their important suggestions and constructive criticism
of which, I hope, I have gratefully taken advantage.
   It is impossible to mention the names of all those who in some way
or other have been helpful. Above all, this is true for the Nimboran
people whose assistance, willingness, hospitality, and patience were
essential for the success of my work. I will hold them in grateful
remembrance for the rest of my life.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"
"  Corresponding with root-morphemes, ending m          -y we find the
Infinitives ending in -ey, e.g.:   dykedu - we two will roast (here),
   dey - to roast (etc.).",[123]
"   Corresponding with root-morphemes, ending III -aofj, we find In-
finitives ending in -Ofj, e.g.
   saofjkedu - we two will water (here),
   SOfj - to water (etc.).",[124]
"  Members of this category end in -ou, whereas the corresponding
root-morphemes end in -0. These members are:
   damgou - to yawn,
   tapou - to help,
   uou - to paddle.",[173]
"Examples:
   i1'3gadu - I will wash (here),
   tektike - you drew (water) (here).",[164]
"   All these new forms belong to a productive category whose members
have in common the semantical element ""the action is connected with
a plural object"". Formally, the members are characterized by an
element -de- that immediately follows the root-morpheme and takes the
form -da- whenever it is immediately followed by the Tense morpheme.
   This category we call the Plural Object category. It is in opposition
with the Masculine Object category and also with those verbal forms
which are not marked as to object. These unmarked forms are used,
if the speaker thinks the action connected with a singular or dual
object which does not consist of one or two male beings, but also if
the action is not thought being connected with any object. These
unmarked forms constitute the category of the Unspecified Object.
   The members of the Plural Object category ask for further dis-
cussion. The first striking fact about them is that with those verbs
which have a special Singular stem for the Unspecified Object and
Masculine Object forms (see § 35) this special form of the root-
morpheme does not occur in Plural Object forms. Further, it must
be observed that all non-Singular forms have the -i- which we came
to know as Plural marker and also the special form of the root-

meaning is concerned, they are no typical Plural Actor forms, as they
may have the meaning of Dual Actor, in the case of the Third Person
Neutral even exclusively so. In the Plural Object category there is
no opposition between Dual and Plural of the Actor, except with the
non-masculine Third Person for which there is a separate form having
only Dual meaning, whereas there is only one form for both Third
Person Plural (regardless of sex) and Third Person Dual Masculine.
   As to the meaning of the members of the Plural Object category,
is must be remarked that in case of a dual object (not including the
speaker or the person addressed) the speaker has a free choice between
forms of this category and those of the Unspecified Object or Masculine
Object categories.","[116, 117]"
