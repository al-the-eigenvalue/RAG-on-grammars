                       The    active         voice        in Halkomelem                is perhaps               best     defined                       as non-passive                and non-middle                  voice,          The        inflectional                       affixes        and     paradigms            of     the     active        voice           are     given                       and    discussed             in    the     chapter         on    pronouns            (4.4,        4.5,                       4.8,     4.9,        4.12,        and 4.13).             The passive            voice            can be
                       defined         as a verb           with         an object           pronoun         being        acted

                       also     given        and discussed                in Chapter               4 (4.10,            4.12,       and
                       4,13).          The     middle           voice     can     be        defined        as    a verb         with                       a     subject        pronoun         acting        on    or     for     itself           without         an                       object        pronoun.             Should         this     include           reflexives               and
                       also     many        intransitives                which       have      a patient               (semant-                       ically)         as     subject?            In     fact,         it is difficult                  to     decide

                  degrees            of    phonemic         pitched             stress:             [’/        primary         or    high-                  pitch     stress,               /*/     secondary             or    mid-pitch                stress,        and                  (unmarked)               low-pitch         unstressed.
                           /’/ nas               several     allophones,                    conditioned                by length        (in
                  the     syllable               in question)             and        by stress             (on the           other     syll-

This     allophone               occurs                  only     on     short           vowels     immediately                preceding                a weakened            word                 boundary’;                the     short     vowel         is        always         the        end     of    a monosyll-                  able     (demonstratives                           and particles                    which            otherwise        occur

But     first,        what                      is     an alloseme           or a sememe?               Allosemes                of a single                       sememe       are    meanings        which        are     in    complementary                   dis-                      tribution           in the        semantic        environment                   and    are     seman-                       tically       similar.

Allosemes                are    narrow         glosses                       (in    the    sense        of    narrow        transcription),                   while        sememes                       are    the    broad        glosses       from     which            the narrow               glosses                       are    predictable.               The     following           notation               seems     best                       to    distinguish           these       glosses         and        levels:                       semantic            ['narrow gloss']              or ['alloseme']
