"        Polarity questions may be expressed with exactly the same kind of structure assimple declarative clauses, but with a distinct intonation pattern; or the question may beintroduced by the positional clitic c (alternative form co, depending on the speaker),which co-occurs with the mode markers, but at absolute clause-initial position (45.a-b).",[240]
"Other uses of the morpheme apu still remain to be identified. The expression may comeaccompanied by an extra interrogative pronoun, as illustrated in (115).
(115) a.     Per=apu d      bj     na    ka          ri     bra?
            why         but   what RLS      2           LOC    wander
            ‘Why are you wandering around?’      b. D per=apu         ta=m         na         ka     ri       ami=t-=ane?

         ‘But why are you acting like this?’
           All these interrogative pronouns occur at the beginning of the clause, precedingthe mood marker. Depending on the discourse context, however, they may themselves bepreceded by conjunctions or other categories of that sort. Besides interrogative pronouns,which introduce information questions, there is a question clitic that introduces polarityquestions in Apinajé; this morpheme is discussed in section IV.3.2.",[183]
       The examples in (1.a-d) illustrate the parallel distribution of clausal complementswith that of an O noun phrase. The noun phrase in (1.a) occurs immediately preposed tothe matrix verb (which therefore displays its relational prefix-equivalent form pubu) andpostposed to the dative phrase that indicates the A argument of the verb in question.,[291]
"          Example (13) illustrates the use of the inchoative with an intransitive verb thatincludes a locative oblique participant.
(13)      na      pa     ra       ickr wr ic-c-m       kacw
          RLS     1      ASP      house ALLT 1-RP-enter.NF about.to
          ‘I was about to enter the house.’
          The examples (14.a-c) show the use of the inchoative with non-canonical markingverbs of sensation and emotion. In (14.c), the verb in question is bivalent; however, noergative marking is involved, as its first argument already takes a case marker, the dativem.",[301]
"       Finally, the adverbial notion of a temporal negative, ‘never’, involves the co-occurrence of the generic negative marker ket with what could be analyzed as a temporalcomponent, a, glossed here as ‘ever’. Together, a...ket form what could be describedstructurally as a “circumclitic”. The temporal marker precedes the element under thescope of negation, and the negative marker ket follows it, occupying the constituent finalposition, as expected.
(81) a. a     prõ    ket.    ajt na       t     ri     bra.
       ever wife NEG alone RLS             HAB    DEM    wander

4. Grammatical relationsKeenan (1976) proposes a set of criteria, which may apply to different languages to agreater or lesser extent, for a definition of Subject as a universal category. The idea ofgrammatical relations as a universal category has been questioned by Dryer (1997), who
                                                                                              254
points out that, while a set of criteria may be helpful to establish what similarities thereare amongst languages, these similarities do not explain why languages are the way theyare. Any similarities are, he claims, the reflexes of functional and cognitive processeswhich themselves may be universal. Thus, it is not grammatical relations as such that areuniversal. Each language displays its own relevant grammatical relations, which may ormay not coincide with the notions of “Subject” and “Object” as found in other languages.","[267, 268]"
"       Starting in Chapter III – Morphology, the transcription conventions employed inthe remainder of the dissertation assumes, with the segmental analysis proposed, thatprenasal consonants are part of the phoneme inventory of the language; therefore they arerepresented as such. Because each of the phonemes in question requires the use of two ormore symbols for its representation, a different set of symbols is adopted for the sake ofeconomy. Thus, the prenasal consonants /mb, nd, d / are represented thereafter as b, d,
                                                                                             34j. Also for the sake of simplicity, the velar nasal consonant / / is represented as g; thealveopalatal affricate /t/ as c; and the alveolar flap // as r.","[47, 48]"
"       Some aspects in the overall structure of ri constructions which show that the ri-marked clause is in fact structurally subordinate to that in sentence-final position are asfollows. In examples (16.a) and (17.b), repeated as (18) below, the sentence-final clauseshave the typical distribution of a main predicate, and the subject of each is that expressedby the nominative pronoun at the beginning of the whole complex sentence. As for theri-marked elements, they have the distribution that a postpositional phrase would have,and they come marked with a postposed particle that, in other contexts, may functioneither as a demonstrative or a locative. An alternative semantic interpretation of the ri-marked expressions in the examples below then could be, respectively, ‘at/upon/when[clause]’. Hence the alternative translations:
(18) a. Kt paj       [kag n-ipec         pa]    ri        ktm apku.

5.2. The postposition kutep       The morpheme kutep marks a temporal adverbial construction, which consists ofclauses that encode simultaneous events. The clauses in question do not occur in asubordinating relation: they occur in a paratactic relation with one another and each hasits own subject. That the clauses involved belong in the same sentence is indicated by thefact that they fall under the scope of the same mood marker; and by the intonation patternof the utterance, which clearly includes them both.","[305, 306]"
"        The fact that some of these core arguments will be marked with adpositions orcase-marking certainly makes it hard to decide whether the participant in question is infact a core argument of the verb. Thus, as Onishi wisely points out, “both morphologicaland syntactic criteria [are necessary] to determine which arguments should be regarded asA, S, O and E” (p.2).
                                                                                         232
       The noncanonical marking of core arguments is understood here, with Onishi(2001), as those patterns that deviate from the standard patterns of argument markingused in a given language. In the case of Apinajé, the canonical pattern is the use of freepronouns to indicate SA/SO/A (nominative pattern), and bound person markers to indicateSO/O (absolutive pattern). Noncanonical marking in Apinajé then involves the use ofvarious postpositions for the expression of what appear to be core arguments, that is,participants that are obligatorily required by verbs.","[245, 246]"
"        Apinajé cosmology, social and physical organization is permeated by thisdualism, which is not as much hierarchical as it is dialectic. This may be observed in theApinajé creation myth, according to which all things existing on Earth were created bySun and Moon. Sun, the older character, is the initiator, the one who poses a particular,harmonic state of affairs. Moon, the younger character, is the antithetical element, theone who questions the order and brings chaos into the status quo. The result of thisinteraction is a thesis that justifies the dual aspect of all creation in both nature andculture. Thus, animals, colors, name sets, ceremonial roles, among other things, aredivided in pairs which are directly associated with either one or the other mythicalcharacter; and the members of each pair stand in a kind of inalienable relationship, for theexistence of one is only justifiable by the existence of the other (Text I, Appendix B).
                                                                                                 4
           Kolti and Kolre, the most relevant pair of moieties of Apinajé social organization,are associated to Sun and Moon, respectively. The village layout and, with it, thedistribution of marriage groups and formal friends, is guided by this affiliation.","[17, 18]"
"       Nonfinite verb forms are characteristically distinct from the base. The changes inform may be subcategorized into three patterns, to be introduced shortly. However, it isnot uncommon for the nonfinite counterpart of a verb to remain unchanged. Descriptiveverbs are the most stable in this respect, followed by transitive and intransitive verbs,respectively.
                                                                                         191
       A base verb may end in a vowel or in a consonant. In the latter case, it is notuncommon for an echo vowel to occur after the word final coda. The quality of the echovowel is typically the same as that of the nucleus of the syllable in question, except whenthe syllable nucleus is /a/: under these circumstances, the tendency is for the echo-vowelto surface as [i] provided it follows a flap; otherwise, no echo-vowel occurs (145). In anycase, verb stems ending in a consonant do not undergo changes due to nonfinite status,except for the fact that the echo-vowel does not occur in the nonfinite form.

       There are two strategies for the expression of imperative constructions. One ofthem is the use of an irrealis clause whose nominative participant is the addressee of thecommand (46.a). This strategy is employed when the speaker is making a request orgiving advice to the addressee. The other strategy is used in more direct commands, andthat is reflected in the structure of the imperative construction (Haiman 1985; Givón2001: 34-35). Here, no mode marker is employed. The proposition is expressed, instead,by the bare or inflected form of the verb, depending on its morphosyntactic class. This isthe only construction type in which a transitive verb may display a nominative pattern ofinflection (i.e., it takes the second person prefix, as one might expect of an imperativecontext (46.b)).(46) a. kt  kaj    i-m me       ok      j-akr          pa     bu

In (1), the matrix verb stem follows a transitivepattern of inflection, whereas in (2), the matrix verb follows a descriptive pattern ofinflection. That is, in (2), the first argument of the matrix verb is indicated by both anindependent pronoun (when it occurs) and the person prefix attached to the verb. In itsturn, the dative marker attaches to the constituent that refers to the (noncanonicallymarked) O argument of the verb in question. When that constituent is a clausalcomplement, the dative marker follows the final boundary of the subordinate clause.","[291, 292]"

       Noun phrases that occupy predicate position in copula constructions can be propernouns (68.a), alienable (68.b-c), or inalienable nouns (69). Prefixes attached to aninalienable noun in predicate position refer to a possessor, which is non-coreferentialwith the subject of the clause; compare (69.a-c) with (69.d).(69) a. pa    na     it-pe a-prõ

        In the case of coreferentiality between the subject and the possessor, as in ahypothetical example such as “I’m my own boss,” the possessor would probably beexpressed by the reflexive marker ami. In verbal clauses, at least, this morpheme isobligatorily present under such coreferentiality conditions (70).

3.5. Locative predicatesLocative predicates follow the same pattern as verbal clauses, since they involve positionverbs, which are typically intransitive. Thus, this clause type includes the mood marker,the subject nominal, the locative adverbial and a position verb, such as ca ‘stand’,  ‘sit’,or other, depending on the number of the absolutive argument (section III.3.1.2.3.)(71) a. kt   kaj      ja=ri            arik.

3.6. Existential predicatesExistential predicates are structurally similar to locative predicates, except that in theseconstructions the verb is dispensed with. The necessary elements are simply the locationand the referent located, which typically comes accompanied by a quantifier or theexistential negative amrakati in the predication.

3.7. NegationNegation is another dimension whereby clauses can be subcategorized into structuraltypes. Negation applies differently depending on the type of predicate being negated.","[260, 261, 262]"
"       It has been noted, for instance, that the negative clitics not only require suchmorphology, but display a morphological make up that may be seen as evidence for averbal diachronic origin, namely, the consonant k-, analyzed here as a reflex of the thirdperson accusative prefix. Other factors that have been considered are its clause-finalposition and its possiblity of occurrence with the clitic ne. The presence of this cliticsuggests an affinity of the form ket with the class of descriptive verbs, in that some ofthem often co-occur with the morpheme ne. These are simple observations, however, andneed to be further investigated.
                                                                                                     298
        The morphosyntactic and distributional facts about the negative morphemessuggest that they may have all originated diachronically from verbal sources. At least inregard to the morpheme ket, a plausible hypothesis is that it must have started out as amonosyllabic negative predicator of tV structure, and that the kV- syllable is a reflex ofthe accusative prefix ku-, also noted in other function words, such as kumrc ‘INTS’ andkt ‘3.ERG’, among others (see chapter IV). The hypothetical predicator *tV must havebeen responsible for the negation of the proposition described in the clause, thusrequiring the nonfinite form of the subordinate verb; whereas the morpheme ku- couldhave operated as an anaphoric/resumptive pronoun, referring back to the negatedproposition. Verbs do take noun phrases as arguments; and it is quite possible that thedistribution of ku- was restricted to cases of propositional, not nominal, negation in a paststage of Apinajé.1 However, since the most frequent scope of negation is the proposition,the use of the *kVtV form may have become more standardized, leading to its reanalysisas the negative stem of Apinajé thus replacing other related forms elsewhere in thegrammar. As far as phonological changes, one could speculate a path such as *kute >*kete > ket, for Apinajé, with vowel harmony and eventual deletion of the stem finalvowel. In any case, it is no longer possible to speak of ket and ketne as true verbs in1
  In Kaingang (Southern Jê), one of the negative markers is indeed a monosyllabic morpheme beginning in
/t/: tõ ‘NEG’ (Wiesemann 1986). However, in that language this form of the negative is employed in narrow
scope negation, specifically, in the negation of nouns; sentential negation is expressed by a similar ket
morpheme. (Thanks to Eduardo Ribeiro for calling my attention to this piece of data, in personal
communication.)

Apinajé. These morphemes have now become positional clitics which do not display thefull morphosyntactic behavior and semantic content of a lexical verb.","[311, 312, 313]"
"        Thus, the strategies presented in (39-40) are not exactly instances of noun phrase,but clausal coordination. Further details on this subject are in section (4).

3. Clause structureIn what follows, the various types of main clause structure are introduced. It will be seenthat some of the variation found in verbal clauses is due to the major distinction betweenthe realis and irrealis mode, as well as to speech-act distinctions, especially the contrastbetween affirmative and negative sentences. Other differences in the structure of verbalclauses are due to the morphosyntactic nature of the predicators involved, namely, thosethat entail the standard pattern of argument marking already introduced (sections III.3.2.1.and III.4.1.1), as against those predicators that involve non-canonical patterns of argumentmarking.
                                                                                          224
3.1. Mode distinctionsThe realis and irrealis encompass all clause structure types in Apinajé. That is, clausesare either realis or irrealis, structurally. From a semantic and functional perspective, therealis mode includes past, present, habitual – negative, positive or interrogative –propositions. The irrealis mode comprises future, hypothetical, counterfactual,conditional, intentive – negative, positive, interrogative and some imperative –propositions. Speech act distinctions therefore do not interfere with mode distinctions,for the most part (except for one type of imperative, as will be seen below).","[236, 237, 238]"

The nasal front mid vowel /e/ is realized by the allophones [ , e] in free variation. Thenasal back mid vowel /õ/ is realized as slightly lower than [õ] and slightly higher than [ ].

       One instance of alternation between this allophone of /õ/ and higher counterparts[, u] has been noted in the corpus. The alternation applies to one morpheme inparticular, the indefinite determiner õ. The alternative realizations of this morphememight be partially due to factors external to the phonological system, however. It appearsthat the indefinite article um [u] has been borrowed from Portuguese and phonologicallyadapted into Apinajé as /õ/. The high allomorphs could be a retention of the originalshape of the borrowed morpheme.","[76, 77, 78, 79, 80]"
"       The third person form i- does not occur very frequently. Although the occurrenceof i- seems to coincide consistently with the absence of a dependent noun phrasecontiguous to the head noun (137), Ø- may also appear in this context (138). It seems,then, that the use of i- is lexically, rather than phonologically or grammatically,motivated.

"The class of plosives comprises stops and affricates (section 1.1.1.); the continuantsinclude fricatives and nasals (section 1.1.2); and the approximants are the flap and glides(section 1.1.3). The contrast amongst Apinajé phonemes is illustrated in examples (1-7)(where “x” stands for “contrasted to”).

  Although it is natural for vowels to become somewhat nasalized in the context of nasal consonants, I have
not been able to perceive any degree of nasalization of oral vowel phonemes in this phonetic environment,
reason why no nasalization is indicated in the phonetic transcription of such examples. The phonetic
nasalization of oral vowels in nasal environments can certainly be captured in an acoustic analysis of the
data; the results could then be compared to the quality of oral and nasal vowel phonemes in other

1.1.1. Plosive phonemesAs a general rule, Apinajé plosives have voiced and voiceless allophones, with thevoiceless counterparts appearing at the onset of stressed syllables, and the voiced onesoccurring in more marginal positions, such as non-stressed syllables and coda position.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]"
"       Noncanonical marking in Apinajé is noticeable with verbs of cognition, emotion,utterance, and sensation, among others. The patterns observed with these verbs all departfrom the basic canonical patterns of argument marking and involve many sorts ofpostpositions – from locative, to dative, to instrumental to ergative. The semantic sub-categorization of such predicators corresponds somewhat to the kinds of postpositionsused, but not necessarily so.
                                                                                                       233
Notionally monovalent non-canonical predicators. Most (notional) monovalent non-canonical predicators (and I say “predicators,” rather than “verbs,” because some of theseare based on nouns4) have their sole participant marked with the dative postposition,although there is one verb, ami kati ‘have fun; enjoy oneself’, which calls for thereflexive pronoun.

 That the elements involved are nouns, and not simply the result of conversion of nouns into verbs, can be
seen from morphological differences between the members of a pair, for instance, as in akr ‘be cold’ as
compared to kr ‘cold (?)’; another example is t- go [RP-LOC water] ‘sweat’, as against  ‘LOC’ and go
‘water’.

         At a closer look, one could hypothesize that the predicator in these cases may betaking a zero third person marker, in which case the predicator could not be adequatelydescibed as monovalent. The difficulty with confirming this hypothesis is that, in somecases, a regular verb adopts an alternative form which is specific to this kind ofpredication. Take the example of m kr ‘feel cold’: elsewhere, the form of the predicatoris akr ‘be.cold’, which may take person inflection, thus also employing the relationalprefix j-. In the case of a zero third person form, the relational prefix would not occur; butthe formative a- would not be lost either. Therefore, the best criteria for deciding whetherthese are mono- or bivalent predicators, and even whether the participants marked withpostpositions are or are not core arguments, must come from syntax. For the time being,I will simply lay out the morphological patterns involved, and will postpone a discussionof the syntactic evidence until section 4.
                                                                                          235
Bivalent non-canonical predicators. Bivalent non-canonical predicators come in avariety of patterns. The primary difference between the patterns is whether A or O isnoncanonically marked, and secondarily whether we should think of some of these asextended intransitives rather than noncanonical transitives. We begin with two clearcases of noncanonical A: some verbs require that the A be marked as a dative, others thatit be marked as ergative.","[246, 247, 248, 249]"

        If the subordinate verb is transitive, the ergative argument of the relative clausemust be overtly marked as such (16.b-c). The ergative marker is a positional clitic andhas the alternative forms t and kt: the former is used with first and second personarguments, and takes person prefixes; kt refers to third person arguments, and takes noprefixes (see chapter VI for a diachronic hypothesis about the development of differencesin the form of the ergative clitics).
                                                                                           209
        The ergative marker indicates the initial boundary of the subordinate clause – andconsequently, of the noun phrase. At the other end, the clausal boundary may coincidewith the nonfinite verb form (16.a) or with a nominalizer clitic (16.b-c). However, as faras the noun phrase boundary is concerned, it is the definite article ja that usually seals it,in these circumstances (16.a-c).","[222, 223]"

takes person inflection and is deictic in nature, its distribution is restricted to the lexicalitems just presented; that is, tar does not occur productively as head of postpositionalphrases. In addition, its semantic content is not transparent, if analyzed in isolation.","[178, 179]"
"Compensatory lengthening applies to a plosive-final lexical base when it is followed by aconsonant-initial morpheme – that is, the plosive is deleted, being replaced by vowellengthening. If the lexical base ends in glide or vowel, no lengthening applies (91-92).

4.5. ProsodiesAspiration. Aspiration occurs between a syllable-final vowel and a stressed syllablebeginning in voiceless obstruent. Vowels often involved in the process are the centrallow phoneme /a/ or the back high phoneme /u/. Aspiration often takes place atmorpheme boundary, but within the same phonological word.

Echo-vowels. Closed syllables usually display an echo-vowel word finally. The echo-vowel is a phonetically reduced sound whose quality is reminiscent of that of the vowelat the nucleus. Words ending in the voiceless affricate /t/ are an exception; the quality ofthe echo vowel in this case is reminiscent of the palatal quality of the consonant – it is [i].

        The echo-vowel indicates the end of a phonological word. It occurs most often incontent words, though there are instances of echo-vowels in function words too. Themorphemes ket and kot, in (96), are a negative particle and a postposition, respectively.","[91, 92, 93]"

               consonants.
a ... ket ne   advl.neg.cmp. never . Ex.: Na t da wr ru ne d um go ja a upm ket ne. ‘It rains a

               atkapi) ‘I cut myself and my blood spilled.’ Nonfinite form: aˆk (before consonants),
               aˆr (before vowels and consonants). Inflection pattern and relational prefix: O=j-aˆ.
               Related forms: u-j-aˆ ‘brocar’ (elderly). Grammatical restrictions: *Na pa ku-j-aˆ.
               *(?) Aw-j-aˆ. *Na ra aˆr ç te) ‘S/he went and cut as they went’; Na ra aˆr/ujaˆr ç mõ
               ‘S/he was cutting/was about to cut’. See kˆjt.
a(C)–          prfx.der. detransitivizing prefix. Grammar: a. Occurs in a large group of intransitive
               verbs, some of which do not have a transitive counterpart characterized simply by the
               absence of this prefix. In such cases, the occurrence of the prefix appears to have been
               lexicalized, and the prefix might be better analysed as a formative in the stem, rather
               than a derivational prefix. b. The presence of this prefix in most verbs simply
               indicates intransitivity; there is a contrast between this and the prefix aw- in that the
               latter appears to encode the antipassive. See aw-.
ajgr          v.intr. scatter. Nonfinite form: S=pigr. Ex.: Ja na m pip ketne; na m m ajgr

           jac. ‘I put my flip-flops on.’ Semantics: This verb root seems to contrast with agje in
           terms of number. Ac is used when the absolutive argument is singular. See r, agje.

           O=j-ac. Nonfinite form: O=acn. Grammar: This verb has a derived intransitive
           counterpart in awjac. Ex.: Na m kupedir jaja kupip jac. ‘The kupe women buried
           the mat.’ Na pa pˆka kam´) ac‡´ ‘I buried it in the ground’. Na pa t, ka ijac. ‘I died

           table). 2. place an object in horizontal position. 3. comb one’s hair. Inflectional
           pattern and relational prefix: O=j=acw . Nonfinite form: acw r. Semantics: One
           aspect in which this verb (and its counterpart i) contrasts with the pair m, ujw is that
           the former may refer to objects shaped in such way that would usually be conceived of
           as lying in horizontal position (e.g. forks and knives), whereas the latter often refer to
           those that could be thought of as “standing up” (e.g. bowls, plates, cups). On the other
           hand, the former pair may also refer to this same class of objects, but indicating that
           they lie upside down. Ex.: Na pa amim iõ kuj jacw . ‘I’ve set my spoons down.’
           Na pa amim iõ prat jacw . ‘I’ve set my plates upside down.’ Akupm im acw .

ag´        n.al. the seed of the tiritica plant (see kapar) used for making necklaces and other
           adonrments. Lexical restriction: *ag . The word  is not appropriate because it

           tiririca seed.
ag       v.tr. thresh; remove the seeds from the chaff (of rice). Nonfinite form, -g´)n. See ag.

           on a string (e.g. glassbeads); pull something through a whole. Inflectional pattern and
           relational prefix: O=j-agje. Nonfinite form: agje. Ex.: Na pa m agje. ‘We all went
           in.’ Im ken kw jagje. ‘Thread some beads for me.’ Impõij u p pa ami jabak
           kot agje. ‘Get me a little põ stem for me to hang on my ear.’ Semantics: This verb
           stem is used when the absolutive argument is plural. See gje; ac.
ago        n.inal. saliva; drull . Relational prefix: ¯-ago
agr´       v.intr. get damaged or impaired. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=j-agr.

           Grammar: This verb seems to have a transitive counterpart: gr. There is one example
           in the database that is indicative of this, but it is not to be confused with the verb gr
           ‘dry’. Lexicon: This predicator may be simply an alternative use of the verb agr
           ‘scatter’. Ex.: Na ickrE krac‡ agr´ ‘The wall got damaged.’ Tm na ami gr. ‘I got
           damaged (i.e. it wasn’t me).’ See gr; ajgr.

           2. be hanging. 3. reach; catch up with someone. Nonfinite form: S=jet. Grammar: a.
           Clause typically includes a postpositional phrase expressing the location in which S is
           suspended or from which it is hanging. If a location from which S is hanging is not
           specified in the clause, it may be expressed as kc pe ‘from a [hanger]’. b. * ajet.
           Ex.: Mkarõ kawr  ajet. ‘The photograph is (suspended) in the basket.’ Na mkarõ

           on the fire.’ See k.
akçt       v.dscr. 1. round; spherical (e.g. of berries). 2. short in length (e.g. of garnments and
           shoes) or in duration. Sociolinguistic: The second sense of this word is used

ake)c‡        v.dscr. spin; turn around. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-akec.
              Grammar: This verb cannot take the detransitivizing morpheme aw-: *awjakec.
              Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: This predicator has a bivalent counterpart in  akec.
              Ex.: Ajakec! ‘Turn around/spin!’

akrˆ          v.dscr. be cold. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-akr. Nonfinite form:
              same. Grammar: a. In predicate position, the relational prefix does not show with a
              third person S, since the third person participant appears in subject position, and there
              is zero third person agreement marking. In attributive constructions, the verb does
              take a relational prefix with a third person participant, and that indicates both elements
              belong within a single noun phrase. b. This verb has a bivalent counterpart in  akr.
              c. This verb can take the detransitivizing morpheme aw-: awjakr. Ex.: Na pa ra ijakr

                 icpe apikudr  mõ. ‘You’re disappearing from me.’ See  akud.

ami)            pro. reflexive marker. Grammar: May occur in a truncated form with the dative
                 morpheme m, resulting in the form amim.
ami c ba     Idiom. Feel ill; suffer from disease. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: [amiS
                 c-] O ba. Nonfinite form: ami c bar. Grammar: The reflexive pronoun refers back
                 to the S of c, whereas the predicate am  c is the O of the verb ba. (Ami=c-=ba
                 ‘RFLX=RP-ill=feel’) See ami kam abak.
ami kam abak Idiom. Feel better; recover from disease. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix:
                 AmiS kam S-j-abak. Nonfinite form: same. Ex. Na pa ra ami kam ijabak  mõ.
                 ‘I’m feeling better.’
ami kati       v.intr.noncan. play; enjoy onself. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: Although the
                 reflexive marker occurs with this verb, the reflexive-verb root pair have become
                 lexicalized as a single predicator. The word kati by itself means ‘waist’; there is no
                 evidence for its use as a verb. In addition, the compound predicator may apparently
                 have its valency increased by means of the morpheme , in  ami kati. Ex.: Na pa
                                                                                                         366

                  like).’ Na pa ict am ar um at im sa nipec prm ne. ‘I wish you’d make me

                  form and relational prefix: S=j-ap. Grammar: a. The use of plural nouns may
                  require the co-occurrence of the dual marker. Presumably, this peculiarity has to do
                  with the semantics of the verb. b. This verb has a causative counterpart,  ap. c.
                  This verb allows for variation in nonfinite forms. It is possible that this variation is
                  determined by the meaning of the verb in each use. Ex.: Akrecti ne Kenkut wa ap ne
                                                                                                     367
              ikw. ‘Akreti and Kengutã were lying side by side.’ Pitt pip pa. ‘Everyone is lined
              up side by side.’ M pa jaja na wa m icpip ket ne. ‘We all are not lined up side by

              ap.
ap´           v.tr. put (e.g. two-by-fours) tidily together. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix:

ap´ rˆ        v.dscr.cmp. be in line. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j=apr. Nonfinite

              offspring at a time, possibly two as it gets older.
ape           v.intr. work. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=j-ape, apen, alternate form:
              S=j-pe. Grammar: This verb does not take the derivational morpheme -ji: *apenji.
              Usage: Variation seems to be due to age groups, the former being spoken by younger
              speakers and the latter by elderly ones. Ex.: Di muj ja km apen prm. ‘That woman
              enjoys working.’
ape´          v.tr. look for; seek; hunt. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-ape.

apirc       n.al.der. 1. ladder; staircase. 2.                  incline; slant; slope (apir=c
              ‘climb.up.NF=INSTR.NMLZ’). Ex.: M apirc ja  mduju. ‘The slope is hard [to
              climb].’

apje          v.intr.dscr. long.

apkatim     n.advl.cmp. tomorrow. (apkati=m ‘morning=DIR’)
apku          v.intr. eat. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=j-apkur. Grammar: a. Related to the
              transitive verb ku ‘eat’ and apparently created by the addition of the detransitivizing
              prefix ap-. Differently than other ap- verbs, however, it maintains this formative in its
              nonfinite form. Ex.: Na pa ra apku. ‘I’ve eaten.’ Na pa ra ijapkur pa ‘I have finished
              eating.’ Na pa ktm ijapkur ket ne. ‘I haven’t eaten yet.’
apkurji      n.inal.der. one how enjoys eating; one who is characterized by the habit of eating.
              Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=j-apkurji. (apkur-ji ‘eat<INTR.NF>-
              AG.NMLZ’). Ex.: Brˆ japkurji ‘Wild animal that eats all the time.’

              marked with the postposition wr.) Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-apoj.
              Nonfinite form: same. 3. v.tr.noncan. find something (pl). Inflectional pattern and
              relational prefix: O=m A=j-apoj. Nonfinite form: same. Phonology: In nonfinite
              position, especially preceding a vowel, the last consonant of the root is realized as the
              voiced alveolapalatal affricate [j], as in poj  mõ. Semantics: The semantic contrast
              between this verb and kat has to do with the number of participants, kat being the
              singular and apoj the plural counterpart. Grammar: a. In the compound verb ‘wake
              up’, the verb roots alternate according to the number of the absolutive argument, thus:
              krkat ‘wake up (sg.)’ and krapoj ‘wake up (pl)’. b. The same is true when the root
              is used with directional postpositions such as wr ‘ALLT’ and m ‘DAT’. C. This verb
              cannot take the detransitivizing morpheme aw-: *awjapoj. Ex.: Na pa m ijapoj. ‘We
              left.’ Na pa m km ijapoj. ‘I found them.’ See kat.
apok          v.tr. make holes. Ex. pi) j‡ˆ rE na tE pi) japok ‘The termites make holes in in wood.’
              Form with relational prefix, -japok.
apr           v.tr. slander someone. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-apr . Nonfinite
              form: same. Grammar: ujapr; ujaprji; *awjapr. Ex.: Na ijapr . ‘That one slanders
              me.’ Na ka ijapr . ‘You dishonor my name.’ Na pa ajapr . ‘I gossip about you.’ Na
              ijapr  ca. ‘That one has been gossping about me.’ Muj na ijapr  ri pa. ‘That one
              has been gossiping about me.’ Pai na kt atpen t kaper prm, ne km atpen kure ne
              km atpe ja pr prm. ‘Panhi like to speak of each other, they get angry at one
              another then fight and slander one another.’ See ujapr ; ujapr ji.
apr´)         v.tr. become satisfied; finish. Relational prefix: -japr´)
apr´)r       v.tr. provoke; tease. Ex. ickra ja na amni icpr´) ne ‘My son is provoking me.’
apro          v.tr. 1. bring; take. See  mõ,  te. 2. buy. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix:
              O=j-apro. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: This verb can take the detransitivizing
              morpheme aw-: awjapro.
apu/´)        advl.cmp behind. the last one in a line; the last thing to be done.

are           v.tr. dig (of potatoes, etc.). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-are.
              Nonfinite form: are. Related forms: are (detransitive form); arei (participial
              resultative form). Ex.: Kwr ja na pa ra are pa ‘The yucca, I’ve dug them all up.’
              Kwr ja na are pe mduju ‘This yucca is hard to dig.’ Kt ar t na pa are ‘It’s that
              way, but I’ve dug it nonetheless.’ Na ra arei ‘They are all dug up.’ See re.
are)          v.dtr. 1. tell. 2. confide about oneself. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: EO=m
              O=j-are. Nonfinite form: are. Grammar: a. The transitivity pattern of this verb is
              the same for both senses. In the second sense, O is encoded by the reflexive pronoun,
              which is controlled by the subject. b. This verb can take the detransitivizing
              morpheme aw-: awjare. See awjare.
ari          v.dscr. 1. jump on or onto the ground; land. 2. dance in a festival. Nonfinite form and
              relational prefix: S=j-ari. Ex.: Te na ajari ne at. ‘Jump and stand on the ground.’

              like to come down here.’
atm          v.intr. 1. walk together as a pair or group. 2. stick together as a close pair or group of
              friends or companions. Nonfinite form and infectional pattern: S=pi-tm. Grammar: a.
              This verb takes the clause-final particle ne. b. There appears to be free alternation
              between finite and nonfinite form when this predicator is modified by kacw. Both
              forms were possible, according to speakers’ judgements; however, there was
              preference for the nonfinite form when the clause was realis, and for the finite form
              when the clause was irrealis. Ex.: Kt paj m akupm atm ne. ‘We’ll walk together
              again.’ Kt ja m akupm atm ne. ‘Those are going to wander around together again.’

atkaje        v.intr. crack; fissure. Nonfinite form and inflectional pattern: S=pikaje. Grammar: a.
              This verb does not have a transitive counterpart in kaje. b. There is evidence of free
              variation between pikaje and atkaje as nonfinite forms; in the latter case, it is not
              possible to tell from the examples what the inflectional pattern is. Ex.: Ka na ka icpe
              i¯õ kukrac‡ me) ¯um atkaje ‘You threw my bowl and it cracked.’ Pa kt paj bri iõ
              kukrac km amim meõ kw men ketne. D na iõ kukrac icpe atkaje pa. ‘I’m not

atkatE        v.intr.der. 1. break into pieces; shatter. 2. crack; fissure. Nonfinite form and
              inflectional pattern:. Grammar: This verb does not have a participial counterpart in pi-
              the same way as other verbs of breaking. Ex.: Na kp tem ne atkat. ‘The glass fell
              and broke [it wasn’t me].’ Kp ja na ra bu um ra atkat. ‘I saw that glass and it was

                Grammar: a. In its first sense, this verb is a reciprocal one; the predication subsumes
                two participants. b. This verb has a bivalent counterpart in  atkje. Ex.: Na pa wa
                atkje ‘The two of us parted ways.’ Icpe apikjer ketne. ‘Don’t part away from me.’ See
                 atkje; kje; akje.

aw–             prfx.infl. detransitivizing prefix. Grammar: Occurs mostly, though not exclusively,
                with verbs that begin in /a/ and take the relational prefix j-. This morpheme contrasts
                with the other detransitivizing prefix aC– in that it appears to encode the antipassive
                and other uses of this category. In this sense, it appears to be better characterized as an
                inflectional rather than derivational morpheme. See aC- ‘detransitivizer’.

                aw-j-ako ‘INTRZ-RP-smoke’; nonfinite form: c-u-j-ako ‘RP-INTRZ-RP-smoke<TR>.)
                Ex.: Di cujakor cw ja na  ne. ‘The woman that smokes is ill.’ *Di kt ujakor.... Di
                cujakor   cw muj na in na. ‘That woman who is smoking is my [formal] mother.’

          Na ra awjakr ne. ‘[The weather] is already cool.’
awjan´)   v.intr. return. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=c-u-j-an. (Finite form: aw-j-
          an ‘INTRZ-RP-?’; nonfinite form: c-u-j-an ‘RP-INTRZ-RP-?). Grammar: a. This verb
          follows the same morphological patterns as other derived intransitive verbs belonging
          to the aw- class. However, there is no evidence for the existence of an as a verb on its
          own. It is possible that this form may have been monomorphemic once, but has
          become lexicalized through history. b. This predicator follows the same pattern as
          awjako in subordinate position, in that it does not employ the ergative marker kt/t;
          instead, it occurs in constituency with the noun, evidence of which is the presence of
          the relational prefix in such contexts. Ex.: Di cujan cw muj ja na in na. ‘That
          woman who has returned is my [formal] mother.’ See aw-.
awjapro   v.intr.der. shop; purchase items for a party or a festival. Nonfinite form and relational
          prefix: S=c-u-j-apro. (Finite form: aw-j-apro ‘INTRZ-RP-buy<TR>; c-u-j-apro ‘RP-

                  the clause-final particle ne. b. The alternate form does not appear in nonfinite
                  position. c. It has an adverbial use in which it modifies certain predicates with the
                  role of an intensifier. Ex.: Na ra kabekr bc tjc kumrc. The jussara is quite good

bra            v.intr. 1. go on foot; walk. 2. stroll. Nonfinite form: S=brar. Semantics: The semantic
               contrast between this verb as against mõ/te apparently has to do with the number of
               participants (bra being plural) as well as the specificity about going ‘on foot’ .
               Grammar: The root may cooccur with the directional/movement particle ma in the
               clause; the combination of particle and verb root means ‘go’. If the particle is absent
               in the clause, the verb root means ‘come’.

ca‡         v.intr. stand in vertical position (of one or a pair of objects or people). Nonfinite form
            and inflectional pattern: S=cm; alternating form: S=car. Semantics: The semantic
            contrast between this verb and kue appears to be that the former indicates movement
            towards standing position, whereas the latter indicates being in that position.
            However, only ca seems to occur in constructions that require position verbs,
            indicating, in this case, something already in standing position. This hypothesis is at
            odds with the morphological class of each verb and their correlation with descriptive
            and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is that the contrast may have to do with the
            number of participants, ca being the singular and kue the plural counterpart. A third
            hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be standing’, but with the semantics of kue
            focusing on the resultative aspect of getting up, and ca not having such connotation.
            Ex.: Pa na pa ca. ‘I’m standing (here).’ Ktm ca. ‘Stand up (few people).’ Na ka va
            km ca. ‘The two of you stood up.’ See kue.

c‡w´        cl. phrase-final clitic, nominalizer of agent. Grammar: This morpheme occurs in
             relative clauses indicating the relativized noun, which may be a subject or object.
             Structurally, it is placed at the end of the relative clause and is followed by the definite
             article ja, or another determiner. Its occurrence in this context appears to be optional.
             Ex.: B t cw ja na pr km apen prm. ‘The man who died enjoyed working.’ Di

da           n.al. rain.
da ac‡et     n.al.cmp. lightning. (da=a-cet ‘rain=dtrz-burn’). Alternate form: da acen. Grammar:
             The presence of the formative a- in this word makes it comparable to words such as
             amgr ‘drought; dry season’. In both cases, the base of the word is a descriptive verb.
             It might even be possible to include awjakr in the equation. Ex.: Da acet ka:pri. ‘It’s
             lightning a little.’

duj          v.dscr. bad; ugly; badly. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=p-uduj; alternate
             form: çmduj. Nonfinite form: same. Alternate form: puduju/mduju; this form does not
             occur in nonfinite position. Grammar: This verb may occur with the clause-final clitic
             ne, which expresses temporary state or condition, in this context. Ex.: Ata na mduju.
             ‘This one (over there) is bad.’ Ata na m mduj tjc kumrc. ‘That one is really
             mean!’ Na pa icpuduju. ‘I’m ugly/mean/sickly.’ Na pa icpuduj ne. ‘I look ugly/am

e            v.tr.noncan. tie; fasten. Inflectional pattern: OE=m e; no relational prefix. Grammar:
             a. One piece of evidence of the absence of a relational prefix for this verb is the
             ungrammatical form *aje (for “tie [it] up!”). b. When there is a beneficiary, the clause
             will contain two dative-marked nominals: one being the beneficiary and the other the
             dative-marked, extended O. c. This verb contrasts with pr, katpr in that it may have
             a participial reading with no change in form. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Kt paj pi
             m e. ‘I’ll fasten the lumber.’ Im iõ boc m e. ‘Tie my cow for me, will you?’ Km
             e! ‘Tie it up!’ B pip muj, na m ra km e. ‘That drunk man, they’ve tied him up.’
             B na ra km e . ‘The man is tied up, sitting.’ Pa na pa m b jaja m e  ca. ‘I’m

ec‡          v.dscr. lie; deceive; cheat; pretend. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c=ec.
             Nonfinite form: et. Grammar: This verb may occur with the dative postposition m in
             a noncanonical pattern of argument marking; in such cases the inflectional pattern is as
             follows: EO=m S=c=ec.

             a table); 2. put away one or a pair of objects. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix:
             O=c-i. Nonfinite form: ir. Grammar: Allows for third person accusative prefix ku-.
             Semantics: One aspect in which this verb (and its counterpart acw contrasts with the
             pair m, ujw is that the former may refer to objects shaped in such way that would
             usually be conceived of as lying in horizontal position (e.g. forks and knives), whereas
             the latter often refer to those that could be thought of as “standing up” (e.g. bowls,
             plates, cups). On the other hand, the former pair may also refer to this same class of
             objects, but indicating that they lie upside down. Ex.: Na pa kuci ‘I’ve put it away.’
i            n.inal. bone. Inflectional pattern: PSSR=i; no relational prefix, apparently. Phonology:
             form alternates between ji and i. The former occurs after conosonant-final nouns and

                   Semantics: This verb appears to contrast with nõ in terms of number. This root is used
                   when the absolutive argument is plural. See nõ. Grammar: The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and 
                   ‘sit’ contrast with their respective counterparts ikw and kri in that the former seem to
                   have a more flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of the absolutive, than
                                                                                                           381
                the latter. It is possible to find examples of m nõ and m , even though these verbs
                refer basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw are often not found
                with singular absolutives. Ex.: M krar jaja m ikw ne. M piget jaja acwj jaja, m
                 ne ikw. ‘The children were all lying (there). The elderly also, they were all ill and
                lying (there).’ Co na ka m ari aikw. ‘Are you all lying there/resting?

                ami nikra kr imõk kr ta. ‘I was chopping onions, then I cut the tip of my finger.’
ipˆ             psp inside.
ipec‡           v. tr. make. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=-ipec. Nonfinite form:
                same; alternate: ipet. Ex.: Na pa ict am ar um at im sa nipec prm ne. ‘I wish
                you would make me some tea.’
ipecji        n.al.der. person who is characteristically known by making things. (ipec=ji
                ‘make=ag.nmlz’) Ex.: kaw´ nipec‡ j‡i ‘basket maker.’ Grammar: When ji is used with
                transitive verbs, the derived word may require the use of relational prefixes
                dependening on whether the verb root starts in a vowel.
ipetc´         n.inal.der. father. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=-ipetc. (ipet=c
                ‘make.NF=INSTR.NMLZ’).
ipok            n.inal. 1. the center of a particular space. 2. the midst (e.g. of a crowd). 3. the
                innermost area of a large location (e.g. a forest). Inflectional pattern and relational
                prefix: PSSR=n-ipok. Grammar: Due to its semantics, this noun is sometimes used
                similarly to a postposition; but its referential nature is also very clear. In cases of
                referential use, a postposition or demonstrative is likely to follow this noun, such that
                the integrity of the genitive construction (or, the NP) in which it occurs is maintained,
                thus avoiding any kind of structural ambiguity. Ex.: Pr nipok ri. ‘The center of the
                forest.’ Pr nipok. ‘In the middle of the forest.’ Kri rac nipok ri. ‘The downtown
                area.’ Kri nipok. ‘In the middle of the village.’ Kapot nipok. ‘In the middle of the
                outdoors.’ Go nipok. ‘In the middle of the river.’ Arigr nipok ri. ‘In the middle of the
                sunlight.’ [Notice the contrast in meaning between this ri-ending phrase and the ones
                above: it could be that in this phrase, the sense of the word is more one of ‘midst;
                being involved/engulfed by’, similarly to the next example.] M ipok ri. ‘In the
                middle of the crowd.’ *Na pa m ipok ca. Na pa m ipok ri ca. ‘I’m standing in the

                 with the sense of bleed is also possible, but the construction is grammatically nominal,

              Inflectional pattern: O=m A=kat; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: m katr.
              Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb and apoj apparently has to do with
              the number of participants, kat being the singular and apoj the plural counterpart.
              Grammar: a. In the compound verb ‘wake up’, the verb roots alternate according to the
              number of the absolutive argument, thus: krkat ‘wake up (sg.)’ and krapoj ‘wake
              up (pl)’. b. The same is true when the root is used with directional postpositions such
              as wr ‘ALLT’ and m ‘DAT’. Ex.: Na pa ickat. ‘I left (the premises).’ Na pa uti
              ipok ri km ickat. ‘I found it out in the woods.’ Na pa km ickat. ‘I found this
              thing.’

              fruit with a hard shell, as a coconut or cupuaçú). Inflectional pattern: O=kat; no
              relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Kp ja na m prir jaja icpe kat. ‘The
              boys broke the glass (to my detriment).’ Na m icpe iõ kp kat. ‘They broke my

katpr        v.tr. tie; fasten. Inflectional pattern: O=katpr; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form:
              same. Grammar: a. This verb is related to pr, which seems to be a participial form of
              it. b. There are examples in which the form pr seems to occur as a nonfinite
              counterpart of katpr; in such cases, pr takes person inflection for object, and that
              contrasts with its use as a participial/resultative form.
katut         n.inal. back

                 ne ‘I haven’t grated them (the yucca roots) yet.’ Phonology: The vowel of the
                 nonfinite form is not nasal; compare with the vowel of the word ken ‘pebble’, which
                 does have a nasal vowel in this position.

kep              cop. third person form of the copula pe ‘be; become’. Grammar: The copula pe is
                 used in nominal predicate constructions, especially those expressing equative
                 predicates and true nominal predicates. It is not used in locative or possessive
                 predicates.
ket              cl. negative marker; negative existential marker. Alternate form: kete. Grammar: a.
                 This form is often used in nominal predicate constructions, although it is not restricted
                 to it. b. This negative marker is used in clauses that indicate a habitual negative, or in
                 a noun phrase that describes a negative property or habit of the head noun referent.
                 Ex.: Ja na kom kete. ‘This person doesn’t drink.’ Ja na kt gwra kago  kom kete.

ketne           cl.cmp. negative marker; factual negative marker. Grammar: a. This form is often
                 used in verbal predicate constructions, although it is not restricted to it. b. This form
                 is used in certain clauses expressing a nonhabitual negative. It contrasts with kete, in
                 this respect. See ket.

kje            v.tr. drag; pull. Inflectional pattern: O=kje; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: kjen.
               Grammar: Like other transitive verbs, this predicator may take the second person
               subject prefix in imperative clauses. However, this inflected form is not to be
               confused with the verb akje ‘open’. Ex.: Kri) pic‡i kam´) go kjen c‡´ ‘Only one of the
               villages has water pipes (água encanada).’ Amn akje! ‘Pull it over here.’ Kjen ketne.

krak               v.dtr.noncan. shoot (a gun). Inflectional pattern: EO=kam [kuce]O=krak. Lexicon:
                   This verb is inherently transitive, but with an invariable O, the noun kuce ‘weapon’.
                   This noun is often ommitted in clauses containing this verb, whereas the target is often
                   overtly expressed, thus giving the impression that this is one of the many noncanonical
                   verbs of Apinajé.

                   This verb contrasts with ku ‘eat’ in that the former refers to a single type of food,
                   whereas the latter makes reference to a meal consisting of many different items. Thus,
                   the notion of number plays a role in the contrast, although it is not controlled by the
                   quantity of food as such but by the variety of the meal. Ex.: Na pa ra aroj kw´ kre)
                   ‘I’ve eaten some rice, already.’ Pa kukre. ‘I’ve swallowed it (e.g. of a pill).’ Kupe

kri)               v.dscr. 1. be seated. Inflectional pattern: S=kri; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form:
                   kri; alternate form S=krir. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb and 
                   appears to be that the latter indicates movement towards sitting position, whereas the
                   former indicates being in sitting position. However, only  seems to occur in
                   constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case, something already in
                   sitting position. This hypothesis is at odds with the morphological class of each verb
                   and their correlation with descriptive and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is that
                   the contrast may have to do with the number of participants,  being the singular and
                   kri the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be sitting’, but
                                                                                                     394
          with the semantics of kri focusing on the resultative aspect of sitting down, and  not
          having such connotation. 2. v.tr. sit multiple people on a particular place. Inflectional
          pattern: O=kri; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. 3. n.al. village. Grammar:
          The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and  ‘sit’ contrast with their respective counterparts ikw and kri in
          that the former seem to have a more flexible use, with respect to the number
          distinction of the absolutive, than the latter. It is possible to find examples of m nõ
          and m , even though these verbs refer basically to singular and dual absolutives; but
          kri and ikw are often not found with singular absolutives. Ex.: Na pa ickri. ‘I stay
          seated [in a particular place]; I live [in a particular place].’ Pa na pa m km ane um
          pip  m m akri pa ka m . ‘I told you guys to sit so you all be seated in the

ku        v.tr. eat, esp. a meal consisting of various kinds of food items. Inflectional pattern:
          O=ku; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: kur. Semantics: This verb contrasts with
          kre ‘eat’ in that the latter refers to a single type of food, whereas the former makes
          reference to a meal consisting of various food items. Thus, the notion of number plays
          a role in the contrast, although it is not controlled by the quantity of food as such but
          by the variety of the meal. Grammar: a. This verb has an intransitive counterpart
          formed by the accretion of the detransitivizing prefix aC-. b. The nonfinite form of
          the verb does not allow for the use of the accusative third person prefix ku-. c. When
          used in the context of this verb, the particle pa apparently refers back to the direct
          object, i.e. ‘all of OBJ’, rather than to the event/action described by the verb itself. Ex.:
          Kt paj kur pa. ‘I’ll eat all of it.’ Ata kur ket ne. ‘Don’t eat that.’ Na pa ra kuku.
          ‘I’ve already eaten it.’ Kaj kur pa. ‘Swallow them all (e.g. of various kinds of pills)’.
          See apku; kre.
ku–       Prfx.pron. third person accusative marker.              Grammar: a. This verb occurs
          overwhelmingly with monosyllabic verb roots. b. This prefix never occurs in
          nonfinite verb forms. c. It indexes the accusative argument of a finite transitive verb
          and the object of a postposition.
ku/e      v.dscr. stand in vertical position (of multiple objects or people). Nonfinite form and
          inflectional pattern: S-kue; no relational prefix. Semantics: The semantic contrast
          between this verb and ca appears to be that the latter indicates movement towards
          standing position, whereas the former indicates being in that position. However, only
          ca seems to occur in constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case,
          something already in standing position. This hypothesis is at odds with the
                                                                                                              395
                   morphological class of each verb and their correlation with descriptive and eventive
                   notions. Another hypothesis is that the contrast may have to do with the number of
                   participants, ca being the singular and kue the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis
                   is that both verbs mean ‘be standing’, but with the semantics of kue focusing on the
                   resultative aspect of getting up, and ca not having such connotation. Ex.: Pa na pa
                   ickue. ‘I stood up.’ Ka na am´) ktm´) aku/e pr´m ‘You want to stand up.’ Ktm

kw                 encl. a bit; some. Grammar: This is a quantifier for noncount nouns, esp. food. Many
                    verbs require its occurrence, and it occurs immediately preposed to the verb. It might
                    be possible to analyse it as occurring within the noun phrase immediately after the
                    noun. Nonetheless, it appears that it is the verb that requires this element, since kw
                    seems to occur most often in noun phrases in direct object position. Ex.: Kçt paj ´bri
                    me/õ kw´ kre) ‘Now I’m gonna have some food.’

ma               cl. centrifuge movement marker. No inflection. Grammar: This particle is used with
                 movement verbs such as mõ, te and bra. It may also be used independently from those
                 verbs in imperatives. Ex.: Pa ra ma mõ ‘I’m going away.’ Ma ‘Go on!’

                 usually presented in a single container (e.g. a stew). 4. throw away. 5. name someone.
                 Inflectional pattern: O=me; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: The
                 use of this verb with the sense of ‘serve food’ contrasts with the verb re, with the same
                 sense, in that the former requires the quantifier kw to determine meõ, whereas the
                 latter occurs without the quantifier. One could describe the distinction also in terms of
                 mass versus count objects. Ex.: Ka na ka i¯me) ‘You threw me.’ Te ne amim meõ
                 kw me. ‘Go help yourself to the food.’ Me bra ne me amim meõ kw me. ‘Go over

mõ                v.intr. come; go. Nonfinite form: S=mõ; alternate form: mõr. Semantics: The semantic
                  contrast between this verb and te apparently has to do with the number of participants,
                  mõ being the plural and te the singular counterpart. Grammar: a. The root may
                  cooccur with the directional/movement particle ma in the clause; the combination of
                  particle and verb root means ‘go’. If the particle is absent in the clause, the verb root
                  means ‘come’. See te, bra; ma. b. This root may be used with the morpheme  in
                  what appears to be a transitive verb compound, ‘bring/take’. c. This root may be used
                  in V mõ (serial) constructions, basically expressing progressive or inchoative aspects;
                  it contrasts with te in this respect, in that the latter may not be used in many of these
                  constructions. In such cases, mõ appears to have acquired a more grammaticalized
                  meaning, whereas te is understood more literally, which makes its use inadequate.
mrõ               v.intr. dive. Nonfinite form and inflectional pattern: S=mrõ. Grammar: This verb
                  cannot take the derivational morpheme -ji (*mrõmji), unless it is used as a transitive
                  verb: kr mrõmji ‘one how likes to sink her/his head’. Ex.: Na pa mrõ. ‘I dove.’ Na
                  pa imrõ rac kumrc. ‘I dove for a long time.’ Na pa imrõ tjc ne. ‘I dove hard (e.g.
                  jumping off from a high spot and splashing water all over when reaching the body of
                  water.)’

nõ                v.intr. 1. lie down; lie in horizontal position (of one or a pair of objects or people). 2.
                  lie at the bottom of a container (e.g. starch). Nonfinite form: S=nõr. Grammar: The
                  verbs nõ ‘lie’ and  ‘sit’ contrast with their respective counterparts ikw and kri in that
                  the former seem to have a more flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of
                  the absolutive, than the latter. It is possible to find examples of m nõ and m , even
                  though these verbs refer basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw are
                  often not found with singular absolutives.
o                 n.inal. 1. leaf. 2. bodily hair. Inflectional pattern: pssr=o; no relational prefix. Exx:

                  nose’. Phonology: apparently no glottal stop before o. This is indicated especially
                  because of the phonetics at the word boundaries: [ka cdo] and [ka bero]
                                                                                                    400

õ kr´)        n.cmp.inal. forehead ¯õ kr´)
õ           n.inal. belly. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=-õ. See u. Semantic
              note: As explained by speakers, the formative õ refers to inner body parts: the guts, the
              intestines, the throat (seen from within), etc. Grammar: This noun changes form
              somewhat when inflected for second person; in that case, the form is atu (a-t-u ‘2-RP-
              belly’, presumably). It is not yet clear why there is such variation. Ex.: Di ata na km
              õ c prm. ‘This woman over there always has intestinal problems.’
õji         n.der.act. One who always has intestinal problems. Ex.: Di ata na õji. ‘This woman

              not take a relational prefix. Ex.: Na pa iõjairi. ‘I vomited.’ Na m õjairi pa. ‘They
              threw up.’ Na pa mebç ja ç i¯õjai)ri) pa ‘I threw up with everything (that was in my

              Grammar: a. This verb apparently contrasts in number with ibc. b. The occurrence of
              the conclusive particle pa with this verb root indicates the end of the action; however,
              with its (presumably) plural counterpart ibc, the construction seems to be point to the
              entirety of the group of objects (i.e. “all of them”), rather than the conclusion of the
              action. Ex.: Na pa ra kupi. ‘I’ve killed it.’ Na pa ktm pir ketne. ‘I haven’t killed it
              yet.’ Na ktm icpir ketne. ‘They haven’t killed me yet.’ Na pa pir pa. ‘I’ve finished

               This verb has a bivalent counterpart in  piao. b. Although this verb does not seem to
               take inflection in either form, it does require the occurrence of the ergative marker
               when in subordinate position. Compare with piagri, in that respect. Ex.: Na pa piao.
               ‘I’m nursing.’ Na pa piao ketne. ‘I’m not nursing.’ Prir kt piao cw ja na ickra ne.

               kaek. Similar to the nonfinite form of aC- verbs, although atkaek is a nonexistent
               verb in the language. The semantics and use of this form is adjectival, as in a

               kaco ‘tear; rip’ and the intransitive atkaco ‘tear, rip’. The semantics and use of this

pikuke        v.prtcpl. broken into pieces. Inflectional pattern: S=pikuke. Grammar: Related to the
               transitive verb kuke ‘break into pieces’. Grammar: This is essentially a nonfinite form
               of the verb, even though it may occur in a regular finite position with no variation.
               The semantics and use of it is adjectival, as in a participial resultative. Ex.: Pipç na ra

pr         v.prtcpl. tied up. Inflectional pattern: S=pr; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form:
            same. Grammar: a. This form has the semantics of a participial resultative form, and
            follows a descriptive pattern of inflection. It is related to the verb katpr, which is a
            transitive counterpart it. b. There are examples in which the form pr seems to occur
            as a nonfinite counterpart of katpr. In such cases, pr takes person inflection for
            object, and that contrasts with its use as a participial/resultative form. Ex.: Kt paj
            akatpr. ‘I will tie you up.’ Im ickrkrac  tjc pa katpr. ‘Keep it steady against the

prek             v.dscr. tall. Inflectional pattern: S=prek; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same.
                 Phonology: The final consonant of this verb is realized as a compensatory lengthening
                 of the root vowel when it is followed by another consonant. If that consonant happens
                 to be the coronal stop /t/, another effect is that the coronal will be realized as voiced.

                Nonfinite form: same. Phonology: The initial consonant of the verb is realized as the
                lateral alveolar approximant [l] in the context of a preceding coronal. Thus, /it-r/ is
                produced [il]. Notice that there is no vowel length, which suggests the alternative
                hypothesis that it is the coronal vowel itself which is conditioning the alternation. Ex.:
                M pa jaja na pa m pr ne arik um m kwr jaja na m ir ne m ma apec. ‘As for
                us, we were left behind and stayed, the others left us and went away.’ Kt ja ir. ‘S/he

rac‡            adv.1. intensifier. 2. adj. large. 3. qtf. much. No inflection. Semantics: The use of rac,
                as well as ru, seems to imply that the predicator being modified encodes a permanent
                property. Both these intensifiers contrast with tjc in this respect, which is used with
                predicators encoding transitional or temporary conditions/states. Phonology: This
                morpheme is realized as [lac] if following a coronal sound — vowel or consonant.
                Grammar: a. This morpheme is used to modify verbs and nouns. There is no evidence
                                                                                                     408
            that it follows the inflectional pattern of descriptives. b. It may, in turn, be modified as
            well (e.g. by the morpheme kumrc). c. This intensifier is compatible with words
            derived by -ji, in contrast with the intensifier ru, which is not. d. There is evidence
            which indicates that, if used with a transitive verb, this morpheme may refer to the
            quantity of the direct object, rather than serve as an intensifier of the verb. Ex.: Go rac
            ‘river (water=large)’. Na ra im bc rac kumrc. ‘(Things) are really good for me.’
            Ickengrji rac ne. ‘I’m really easy to get tired.’ Na pa icpuduj rac ne. ‘I’m really

            which do not form a pair. 3. help oneself to foods of various kinds. Inflectional
            pattern: O=re; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: The use of this
            verb with the sense of ‘serve food’ contrasts with the verb me, with the same sense, in
            that the latter requires the quantifier kw to determine meõ, whereas the former occurs
            without the quantifier. One could describe the distinction also in terms of mass versus
            count objects. Ex.: Me ac‡w´j jaja apen kr´) ti re) ‘They are also going to play (with
            the mangaba ball).’ Ma te ne amim meõ re. ‘Go help yourself to the food.’ Me ma bra

ru)        adv. 1. intensively; repetitively. 2. adj. plenty. 3. grand. Phonology: This morpheme is

                                                                                                        409
            vowel or consonant. Semantics: The use of ru, as well as rac, seems to imply that the
            predicator being modified encodes a permanent property. Both these intensifiers
            contrast with tjc in this respect, which is used with predicators encoding transitional
            or temporary conditions/states. Grammar: This intensifier is not compatible with
            words derived by -ji, and thus it contrasts with the intensifiers rac and tjc, which are
            used in those cases. Ex.: Mõkrpoj ruti ‘name of a traditional festival’

t´jc‡       adv. 1. intensifier. 2. adj. hard; tense, stiff, rigid; robust. 3. fast. No evidence of
            inflection. Nonfinite form: t´jt. Semantics: The use of tjc seems to imply that the
            predicator being modified encodes a transitional or temporary condition/state. This
            intensifier contrasts with ru and rac in this respect, since these seem to be used with
            predicators encoding permanent properties. Grammar: a. This morpheme is used to
            modify predicates. In its turn, it may be modified by the intensifier kumrc. b. This
            morpheme has a descriptive counterpart, itjc. Ex.: Ibut tjc. ‘My neck is tense.’ Na

                third person demonstrative muj. In the first case, the resulting form is a proximal
                demonstrative with a second person as the deictic center, atar ‘over there (close to
                you)’. In the second case, the resulting form is a distal demonstrative, mujtar ‘over

te ti           n.al.aug. insect (sp.), Port.: carrapato.
te)             v.intr. come; go. Nonfinite form: S=tem. Semantics: The semantic contrast between
                this verb and te apparently has to do with the number of participants, mõ being the
                plural and te the singular counterpart. Grammar: a. The root may cooccur with the
                directional/movement particle ma in the clause; the combination of particle and verb
                root means ‘go’. If the particle is absent in the clause, the verb root means ‘come’.
                                                                                                     411
                See mõ, bra; ma. b. This root may be used with the causative (?) morpheme  in what
                appears to be a transitive verb compound, ‘bring/take’. c. This root contrasts with mõ,
                in that the latter may be used in V mõ constructions, whereas the former has limited
                distribution in this respect. In such constructions, mõ appears to have acquired a more
                grammaticalized meaning (progressive; inchoative), whereas te is understood more
                literally, which makes its use inadequate.

            something; drop. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=m A=-r. Nonfinite
            form: same. Phonology: a. In the context of a following vowel, an epenthetic flap [r]
            separates the two, as in arr  mõ. b. There is root-initial vowel alternation between
            [u, ], such that [u] occurs in initial position (although it may fluctuate with [ ], in this
            position) and [ ] occurs systematically after the relational prefix. This process is
            observable in other verbs as well. Usage: This verb is used by older generation
            speakers with the sense desciberd in 2, whereas younger speakers tend to use the verb
            kaga, instead. Ex.: Na ka ra im arr  mõ. ‘You’re already leaving me.’ Na km
            ickine t im ur. ‘He liked me but left me nonetheless.’ See kaga.

            2. place multiple pots or pans of food on the fire so as to cook. 3. stick something into
            the ground, right-side up. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=c-ujw.
            Nonfinite form: ujw.. Semantics: This verb (as well as its counterpart m) is used
            with reference to objects shaped in such a way that allow the speaker to conceive of
            them as “standing up”, such as plates or cups. Its use would be more problematic with
            objects such as forks and knives, for instance, since these kinds of objects are typically
            laid in horizontal position. Ex.: Kt paj amim meõ kuw kam ujw. ‘I’m going to put
            my foods on the fire.’ Na pa ra amim iõ prat ne iõ kpti cujw. ‘I’ve already set
            my plates and cups.’ Pa iõ kp cujw ketne. ‘I’m not going to set my cups (e.g. at the

            has a counterpart which is derived from the transitive counterpart of the verb. Ex.: Di

ukrarkr       v.dscr.cmp. belch (with an offensive odor). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix:
               S=c-ukrarkr; alternate form: S=p-krarkr. Grammar: The inflected form of this verb
               alternates between cukrarkr and pkrarkr. This may be a case of innovation in the
               making from one pattern to the other. It is possible that, for the basic form of the verb,
               presumably ukra, the use of one of the relational prefixes is steady, with no
               alternations. But this hypothesis needs to be verified in future research, as there are no
               occurrences of the basic verb stem in the database as it is. Ex.: Pa na pa icukrarkr.
               ‘I’m burping.’ Na ka acukrarkr. ‘You are burping.’ Ne na ukrarkr. ‘This one is

               morpheme . b. The occurrence of the relational prefix in this descriptive does not
               seem to correspond to a difference between attributive and predicative positions, as is
               the case with jakr ‘cold’, for instance. Ex.: Na pka kr cupm. ‘The whole on the

               form:  kw r. Grammar: This verb does not require the use of a relational prefix with

/o            v.tr. 1. suck on a piece of fruit (e.g. mango); ingest juicy foods (e.g. honey). 2. drink
              the juice extracted from fruits or plants. Inflectional pattern: O=o; no relational
              prefix. Nonfinite form: O=or. Semantics: This verb contrasts with its counterpart kao
              in that the latter refers specifically to the act of sucking the juice out of a fruit, e.g. an
              orange. Grammar: usually employs the quantifier kw when O is a mass noun. Ex.:
              Na pa manti o. ‘I ate the mangoes.’ Ma:di o tjc ne. ‘I sucked the mango hard (until

              ne ç kuc‡wa t´jc‡ kumrEc‡ ‘Dada put the chicken to cook and now it smells good!’
              Phonology: The basic form of the verb assimilates to the environment and is realized
              as [cn ], as it precedes the conjunction ne. 2. v.intr. roast; cook; grill. Inflectional
              pattern and relational prefix: S=c-r. Ex.: w, na ra ´r´ ‘Yes, it is roasted.’ Na ktm
              r  ca. ‘It’s still cooking.’ Na ktm meõ r  ca. ‘The food is still cooking.’

√r            v.dscr. enter. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c- r; alterate form: r .
              Nonfinite form: same. Semantics: It appears this verb does not participate in the
              number opposition that characterizes the verb pair ac/agje, in which the former is the
              singular counterpart and the latter the plural one. Ex.: Na pa ra ic r . ‘I went in.’ Na
              t ri akupm r pr k. ‘Looks like it went in again.’ Ma, ata ra m kapot  ca t na m

ˆr          v.tr. cut off; remove; pick (of fruit). Inflectional pattern: O=r; no relational prefix.

            (bunch).’ Na pa iõ pico r kaciw ‘I’m abou to get my bananas.’ Na pa iõ pico r 
            ca ‘I’m getting my bananas.’
r          v.tr. weave. Inflectional pattern: O= ; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: O=r. Ex.:

            in a deep container (e.g. a bowl). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=c-.
            Nonfinite form: r. Semantics: This verb contrasts with such others as me, re and gje
            on the basis of the category of number, among other details. Morphology: The verb 
            ‘serve’ is almost homophonous with the verb r ‘cook’, except that the former has a
            different finite form and a relational prefix, and the latter has the same form in both
            finite and nonfinite positions, and it has no relational prefix. Ex.: Na ktm meõ kw
            cr  ca. ‘She is still serving herself to some food.’ Te ne amim meõ kw c ne ip
            amim meb ata kw re. ‘Go help yourself to some food, get yourself some of these

¯ˆ)         v.intr. sit. Nonfinite form: S=r. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb
            and kri appears to be that the former indicates movement towards sitting position,
            whereas the latter indicates being in sitting position. However, only  seems to occur
            in constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case, something already
            in sitting position. This hypothesis is at odds with the morphological class of each
            verb and their correlation with descriptive and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is
            that the contrast may have to do with the number of participants,  being the singular
            and kri the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be sitting’,
            but with the semantics of kri focusing on the resultative aspect of sitting down, and 
            not having such connotation. Grammar: a. This verb is used in VV constructions,
            indicating progressive or continuative aspect. b. The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and  ‘sit’ contrast
            with their respective counterparts ikw and kri in that the former seem to have a more
            flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of the absolutive, than the latter. It
                                                                                                  421
        is possible to find examples of m nõ and m , even though these verbs refer
        basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw are often not found with
        singular absolutives. Ex.: Pip  muj  . ‘Sit on that bench.’ See r, kri.
ˆ)r     v.tr. sit one person or two people on a particular place. Inflectional pattern and
        relational prefix: O=-r. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Ja mu atõ pip  r. ‘Sit your
        brother on that stool.’ Pip ata  r ketn d pip ata mduju, ra pikuke. ‘Don’t sit

m      v.tr. 1. place one or a pair of objects right-side up on a surface (e.g. table, counter or
        ground). 2. place (a pot or pan of food) on the fire so as to cook. Inflectional pattern
        and relational prefix: O=c-m. Nonfinite form: same. Semantics: This verb (as well as
        its counterpart ujw) is used with reference to objects shaped in such a way that allow
        the speaker to conceive of them as “standing up”, such as plates or cups. Its use would
        be more problematic with objects such as forks and knives, for instance, since these
        kinds of objects are typically laid in horizontal position. Ex.: Kt paj ami m kuw

 The phenomenon described here as conversion is sometimes referred to in the literature as functional shift
or as zero derivation. As Bauer (1988) points out, however, the term “zero derivation” is not felicitous
because it would imply a contrast between a pair of word forms based on the presence versus the absence
of some distinctive morphological element between its members, which is not true in cases like these.
Thus, the “zero morph” analysis would be more suitable when describing a paradigmatic contrast.

2.3.5. SuppletionSome postpositions display suppletive inflectional forms. The postposition pe‘detrimental’, inflected for person in (28), is illustrative. A hypothesis for thesesuppletive forms is that, at an earlier historical stage, these postpositions must have takenthe third person prefix ku-. Vowel harmony may have applied, affecting the quality ofthe prefix vowel, followed by deletion of the word final vowel. This hypothesis needshistorical-comparative verification, however.

       A subset of verbs display different forms depending on the number of participantsin the events they describe. I do not analyze these cases as suppletion; these are actuallypairs of semantically related but distinct verb stems (section 3.1.2.3).","[112, 113]"

3.1.2.3.Lexical pairsPlural Stems vs. NonPlural Stems. Apinajé displays verb pairs which encode basicallythe same semantics, but contrast in the number of the absolutive argument. The contrastseems to lie in a distinction between plural, on the one hand, and singular, dual, or massabsolutives (termed here “non-plural”), on the other. Both bivalent verbs and monovalentverbs may have such pairs; in the case of monovalents, each member of the pair maycome from a distinct class – intransitive and descriptive. Most such monovalent verb

pairs consist of movement and position verbs (60). Transitive verb pairs include abroader range of meanings, from position manipulation to ingestion, to killing (61).(60) a. Descriptives:           PL              NON-PL

        The pair ku/kre encodes an interesting distinction: here, the contrast is not somuch in quantity, but whether the absolutive argument consumes a diversified meal,consisting of servings of different foods (ku); or whether the participant ingests food of asingle kind, regardless of the quantity or number (kre). Additionally, there is anindependent distinction between these two stems, with the possibility of kre indicating amore perfective action, ‘swallow’, in some contexts, whereas ku is unmarked for thatdistinction.","[142, 143, 144]"

       The negation of descriptive verb predicates, illustrated in (80), presents somevariation as to which form of the negative should be used. Most consultants tended toemploy ket=ne for negation of descriptive predicates. However, at least one consultantshowed preference for the use of the simplex negative morpheme ket in these contexts.","[265, 266]"
"          Consider the examples in (20). In (a), the regular use of the verb t in a simpleclause is illustrated. In (b-c), the lexical verbs of each clause co-occur with the sequence mõ ‘do go’ and  nõ ‘do lie’, respectively. The lexical verb appears in its nonfiniteform, as already mentioned, whereas the other two verbs appear without any sort ofinflection whatsoever. Both examples (20.b-c) encode the progressive aspect.(20) a. na        pa     t.

          In examples (20) as well as (21-22), we notice the use of the verb mõ ‘go’ withlexical verbs of varied semantic nuances, such as ‘die’, ‘disappear’ and ‘mature’. This

fact demonstrates that the meaning of the movement verb is not literal, although it mustbe compatible with the semantics of the lexical verb to some extent. It indicates ametaphorical transition from a previous stage to a new one: from life to death, fromappearance to disappearance, from green to ripe.(21)    ka     na     ka      ra     ic-pe a-pikudr                        mõ

        Compared to (20.b) and (21-22), it is possible to note that similar constructionsinvolving position verbs focus more on the activity being performed, ‘cry’, ‘fasten’,‘dance’ (23), rather than the result accomplished after the activity has been concluded.

        Not all movement verbs are eligible for appearing in this construction type, asthey yield literal rather than grammatical meanings. Thus, the verb te ‘go’ in (24.a)indicates the actual movement of the participant as s/he fastens the wood sticks; that is,

there are two simultaneous actions going on. Comparatively, the examples in (24.b),involving the dative postposition m in place of the morpheme , indicates literalmovement towards the locus of an action.

       Some alternative hypotheses are possible for the analysis of the morpheme  inthis context, since this marker appears in various positions with distinct meanings, in thegrammar of the language. One hypothesis could be that  is the instrumental postpositionin the examples above, and that would even justify the nonfiniteness of the precedingverb; after all, in order for it to be the object of a postposition, it must be more nominalthan verbal – and that is what nonfinite verb forms are, in Apinajé.","[307, 308, 309]"
"        Like the ku- formative discussed above, it is possible that the i- observed in theseverbs may have started out as a third person prefix which became reanalyzed as part ofthe stem. Additionally, as with the õ- formative described above, this morphologicalpattern is also observable in a large number of nominal stems.(56)    ibc      ‘exterminate; kill [PL] O’ [TR]

Õ- Verb Stems. Õ-verbs constitute a fairly transparent semantic class. The morpheme õ-refers to the inner side of the body, as may be seen in most examples of the set (57). Themeaning of this classificatory morpheme becomes most obvious when it occurs withnouns, which form a much larger õ- class than verbs. These verbs, as well as the nouns,take the relational prefix -. Of the verbs below, the first three are descriptive; the fourthis a transitive, and the last is an intransitive.(57)    õcwa                   ‘be sleepy’

Pia- Verb Stems. Pia- verbs also have to do with the body, and make more sense if pia-is thought of as a nominal component. Of the base roots occurring with these verbs, atleast two are clearly identifiable: o ‘suck’ and gri ‘be small’. It is possible that m is anonfinite form of such a movement verb as ‘enter’ (in which case the meaning
                                                                                          127
‘embarrassed’ would call for a metaphorical interpretation), except that in that case, onewould expect the relational prefix c-, which does not occur.","[139, 140, 141]"
"As a final result, she concludes that there are just two series of phonemes: oral stops andnasal consonants.

       The intention here is to propose an analysis alternative to Ham (1961), one thattakes into consideration the existing contrastive pairs. I then propose three (not two)series of related phonemes – stops, nasals, and prenasal stops –, noting that the contrastbetween nasals and prenasal stops is observable only before nasal vowels, as illustratedby the following examples.(32) a. /na/                   [na]           ‘RLS’
     b. /nda/                  [nda]         ‘rain’

       One initial hypothesis for the case of Apinajé obstruents would be that theprenasalized phoneme series is a recent development starting off from the nasal-oralcontexts in which transitional segments are inserted, as seen with the velar nasal phoneme//, where an oral velar transition [k, g] appears before oral vowels but not before nasalvowels (section 1.1.2, examples (37-38)). Obviously, this historical hypothesis needs tobe tested through comparative analysis. This is a task that is beyond the scope of thisdissertation, and therefore will be postponed.

      The inventory of relational prefixes for intransitive verbs also includes coronalelements, but – crucially – only intransitive verbs display the form pi-, which applies tobase stems beginning with a specific middle prefix. The set of relational prefixesobserved in intransitive verbs is displayed in (141). Notice how distinct the pattern isfrom the other two sets: not only does pi- occur exclusively in this set, but it seems to bethe preferred choice. The stem acquires a consonant-initial form, once pi- has beenattached to it.

This state ofaffairs indicates that, even though pi- has a distribution similar to relational prefixes, it isnot a member of this class, but rather a morphological component that serves to indicate acategory pertaining to the class of intransitive verbs itself (reason why I consider it to bea the “pseudo-relational prefix”). The semantic value of this category is not clear,however.

The occurrence of the latter prefix, which may also have originatedhistorically from a distinct source, coincides with vowel alternations in certain stems: avowel /u/ is realized as //, in some stems, and as // in a few others (142.e). This stem-initial u- is in fact a formative that occurs with a small set of stems, characterizing twomorphological classes (section 3.1.2.2).","[198, 199, 200, 201, 202]"

Minas Gerais, Goiás, Tocantins, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, and parts of theStates of São Paulo, Paraná, Maranhão and Piauí (map 1). The biome characteristic ofthese areas is the cerrado, a savanna landscape typical of Brazil.2         The cerrado is characterized by hot, semi-humid weather consisting of rainysummers and dry winters; rainfall indices range from 32 to 64 inches a year. The soil isancient, deep, and naturally poor in chemical nutrients. Cerrado vegetation ischaracterized by a herbaceous stratum that extends over continuous, mostly flat areaswith a variable quantity of trees and shrubs, and by forest formations at river banks; itincludes, in addition, patches of palm trees and wetlands. Both the herbaceous layer andthe ligneous vegetation are characterized by the ability to sprout or rapidly recover afterthe dry season or forest fires, a morphology that may have been an adaptive developmentof the vegetation to survive frequent natural fires caused by lightning and other naturalphenomena. The various possible combinations and densities of the basic elements foundin the cerrado vegetation result in a wealth of different ecosystems which house one ofthe largest diversities in plant and animal species on the planet (Pivello 2004; Delitti andPivello 2004).3         The Apinajé, like most Jê, are a cerrado people. Traditional Apinajé territory isthe delta at the confluence of the Tocantins and Araguaia rivers, in the north, extending2
  Because they differ in various respects from the savannas of Africa, the term “cerrado” has been adopted
in the literature to refer to these typically Brazilian ecosystems (e.g. Goodland 1971; Pivello 2004). Being
the second largest biome of Brazil, the cerrado originally extended over about eighty-five percent of the
Central Plateau, which represents about 1,5 to 2 million square kilometers or approximately twenty percent
of the Brazilian territory (Delitti and Pivello 2004; Fonseca and Por 2004).

 For that reason, the cerrado is one of the priority areas for the preservation of biodiversity on Earth
(Delitti and Pivello 2004).

In spite of theproximity to the main rivers, the Apinajé typically build their villages inland, close tosmall creeks. Their economy relies basically on crops, gathering and hunting, differentlyfrom other Macro-Jê, such as their Karajá neighbors, who typically live at the river banksand rely mostly on fishing.","[19, 20, 21]"

"        One set of nouns includes prefixes that occur more productively in verbs, namely,the middle prefixes (a-, aw-, am-; see section 3.1.2.4). When attached to verbs, theseprefixes typically result in detransitivization of the base. A similar result holds withnouns, in that the valency of the noun may also be reduced: inalienable nouns becomealienable after the derivation (44.a). There is one instance in which the opposite is true,with the derivation departing from an alienable noun (44.b). Other cases involve the useof verbal roots as bases, a role that may be performed by transitive, intransitive ordescriptive verbs (44.c-d). Sequences of morphemes belonging to the “middleinventory,” such as aw- and am-, apply to these verbal bases for noun derivation.

Ambivalent Nouns. Some nouns may follow either of the two patterns just introduced –prefixation or the postpositional genitive construction. This property defines the set ofambivalent nouns, which include terms for work tools, utensils, cultural items, amongothers. The choice for one or the other morphosyntactic pattern seems to be determinedby extralinguistic factors, such as whether the possessor is the same person who made thepossessed referent; personal preference for a given referent, among others. Apparently,the closer the involvement or interest on the part of the possessor for the possessed item,the more likely it is for the inalienable pattern to be used (38.a); otherwise, the alienablepattern applies (38.b).(38) a. ic-kaw                                   ‘my basket’

3.1.1.2.Morpho-semantic classesNouns have in common with Verbs and, to a lesser extent, Postpositions, stems thatinclude the formatives õ- and i-. Presumably, these formatives are historically derivedfrom nominal elements; -i is a third person prefix of limited occurrence, elsewhere in thelanguage (section 4.1.1). The formative i- appears in Verbs and Postpositions. Theformative õ appears in Verbs but not Postpositions.

Õ-Noun Stems. The semantics of the formative õ refers to ‘inner side’, combining thesenses found among Verbs and Nouns. In Nouns, the formative seems to have a morespecific meaning, especially among inalienable, body part nouns. Body part nounsconstitute the majority of nouns formed with õ; here the formative refers to the ‘innerside of the body’. Other related meanings occur with other nouns of this class, includingcompounds.","[122, 123, 124]"

  Coronal vowels are those produced in the coronal area, i.e. non-low front vowels. Non-coronal vowels are
those produced elsewhere (Lahiri and Evers 1991; Clements 1985).

 The following example illustrates one instance of the flap allophone in the context of a non-coronal
vowel. Here, the condition for this allophone to occur at syllable coda is presumably the nasality of the
vowel at the nucleus (the flap does not occur in the context of oral /o/, as demonstrated in (18.a)),
associated with the coronal properties of // at the onset.
      /põt/                        [põo]                   ‘run’

       Word-medially, the voiceless alveolar allophone [t] is preferred at syllable codawhen followed by a voiceless obstruent (20). The voiced alveolar allophone [d] occursbefore a sonorant, as illustrated by the compound in (21.a), compared with that in (21.b).

        As with the other voiceless obstruents, there is alternation between the voiced andvoiceless counterparts of /k/ word-finally, with preference for the voiced allophone [g] inthe presence of echo-vowels.

        The occurrence of /k/ at syllable coda does not seem as frequent word mediallywhen compared with other supralaryngeal stops. The data in (25) are compoundsinvolving the diminutive clitic  ; the allophone [g] is preferred when followed by thesonorant. (25) a. /pt=ka k= /         [ptka g ]         ‘anteater (sp.)’
      b./mbek= /             [mb g ]            ‘seriema (bird sp.)’
        The phoneme /k/ is palatalized [kj] before front vowels, which is especiallynoticeable in careful speech (26).
(26) a./ ken= /               [kjenl ]             ‘pebble’

The glottal stop phoneme // occupies stressed syllable onsets, where it contrasts with thepresence or absence of other segments (see (7) above). Other occurrences of [] arephonetic, particularly observable in careful speech and typically indicative of syllableboundaries involving obstruents.

Affricates. The palatal affricate /t/ comprises the allophones [t, t, d, d], though it ismost often realized as alveopalatal [t, d]. It may occupy syllable onset or coda. Aswith other plosives, voiceless allophones of /t/ occur in stressed syllable onsets andvoiced allophones in unstressed syllables (28).(28) a. /ta/                   [ta]                  ‘stand’
                                [ta]      b./aptet/                [aptet]               ‘peba (armadillo, sp.)’

        In word medial and final positions, voice alternation is largely determined by thesonorant quality of the environment. In the context of nasals and glides word medially,the voiced allophones [d, d] may even occupy the onset of stressed syllables (29-30).
(29) a. /mb =t /            [mb d ]             ‘bee (sp)’

        Word finally, voiced alternants are preferred in sonorant contexts as well. Noticethe absence of sonorant consonants in example (31.a) and the presence of the voicelessallophones. Contrast with (31.b), where the word/syllable begins with a prenasalizedconsonant. The voice properties of the pre-nasal phoneme favor the occurrence of thevoiced allophones [d, d]; so does the presence of echo-vowels (31.b-c).

Prenasalized Stops. The labial and coronal prenasal(ized) phonemes /mb, nd, d/ arevoiced complex segments consisting of homorganic nasal-obstruent contours. Theirdistribution is restricted to stressed syllable onset, word initially and medially. Theprenasal stops contrast with nasal consonants before oral vowels, but they do not contrastbefore nasal vowels. In addition, there is no contrastive prenasalized velar stop, and thenumber of contrastive pairs for the series is rather small, amounting to only six or sevenpairs in my database.","[62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]"
"       The ergative markers t and kt must have evolved from a nominal source. Myclaim is based on their distribution in the sentence and their function in present-dayApinajé syntax, as case markers of nominal elements. However, the possibility that theprefix ku- may have participated in the development of the suppletive third-person formof the ergative is also present here – a path that I propose for the other two postpositionsthat display suppletive forms, namely, the detrimentive and the dative, as well. Thehypothesis is displayed schematically below:
(1)            *ku-m        >       k-m >       km     ‘3.DAT’
               *ku-pe         >       ke-pe >        kep     ‘3.DTR’
               *ku-t         >       k-t >        kt     ‘3.ERG’
       The idea proposed in (1) is that all three postpositional markers may once havebeen used with the third person prefix ku. With the frequency of use, the vowels involvedunderwent certain phonological changes, such that non-low vowels ended up in fullharmony, whereas in the environment of a low vowel, only partial asimilation took place,
                                                                                              300
such that the high back vowel became lowered. Eventually, all word-final vowels werelost, giving way to a heavy monosyllabic word.","[313, 314]"

Associative me. The associative me is not as frequent in the database as the instrumental, used for the same purpose. There appears to be a slight semantic distinction betweenthe two, as witnessed by translations provided by the speakers: while  means ‘with’, memeans ‘along with; in addition to’. This may not be that significant a distinction,however; and it seems as though the former is gradually replacing the latter in terms offrequency of use, though this is just a speculative remark. Structurally, the associativepostposition requires the presence of the dual marker wa in the clause (further syntacticdetails are in section IV.2.1).

  The festival celebrated the end of the mourning period for the passing of a certain Apinajé man. The
Krikati singers had been specially invited for the occasion; I had the privilege of being recruited by the
Apinajé organizers to document the event.

working with speakers out of the field probably adds up to some twenty days. On theother hand, I made four trips to the Apinajé area, staying in the field for a total offourteen months. The main loci of my field research were the villages of São José andPatizal. It was not until 1999 that I had the opportunity to visit the remainder of thevillages distributed in the reservation (a total of eight, at the time). I was accompanying acrew from FUNASA who had to visit all the villages on that same day. For me, the tripserved better as a first pass to the locations of each village than as a suitable occasion forcollecting reliable linguistic information. Other trips to those areas are still necessarybefore I am able to provide first-hand information on the sociolinguistic aspects of eachvillage or on any linguistic variation among the Apinajé communities. For that reason, Iwill not speak of dialectal variations of Apinajé in this dissertation.","[46, 47]"
