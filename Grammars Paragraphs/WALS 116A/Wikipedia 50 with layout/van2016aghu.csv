Examples of the use of future forms in the text corpus are restricted to a
handful of cases, all of which are presented here. The first example is found
in (73) below, which is a reaction to the question presented in (72) (for
question formation with a xajo see Table 31 in section 2.7). Note that both
the question clause and the declarative-affirmative clause are headed by
finite future forms: ièna and ieje, respectively.",[95]

4.1.2 Negative clauses and question clausesFor negative verbal clauses and verbal question clauses the reader is
referred to 2.6 and 2.7, respectively. In 4.6 below, we will compare the

"2.7 Verbs combined with polar question particles
    ka or a xajo
Drabbe 1957: section 17, page 9; section 45, page 17-18Parallel to what we saw for negative polarity in the previous section, polar
questions are also formed by the use of elements that have a predicative
function. The following table compares the strategies of forming polar
questions in nominal, adjectival and verbal clauses.

It should be noted that in nominal and adjectival clauses =ka and a xajo do
not just mark a polar question, but are at the same time predicators over the
noun or over adjective. If we take this into account, the structure of the
polar questions formed with verbs is strikingly similar to the structure of
negative verbal clauses described in the previous section. Here too, the
verbal clause is embedded in another clause; the structure and semantics of
this construction could be rendered as in the following figure.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                      125Syntactic structure          [[dade]verbal clause      =ka / a xajo]interrogative clause
Semantic structure           [[I come]                 is it?] -> ‘Is it: I come?’
Figure 8: verbal clauses embedded in an interrogative clause
In the figure above, =ka has been rendered as a clitic and not — as is done
by Drabbe — as a suffix. This is to express that the formative is
syntactically independent from the verb that it follows, but probably
phonologically dependent, in that it seems to need a host to lean to. 89 It
follows the verbal or nominal clause, and is in free variation with a xajo.
Somewhat atypical for a clitic, however, it causes stress shift in the verb
that it attaches to, making the stress shift from the verbal suffix to the final
syllable of the root (cf. section 1.2.3). As can be seen in Table 30 below,
for semifinites and distant past forms stress shifts to the syllable preceding
the person-number marker; for historical past forms stress is on a in dia,
while in future forms stress shifts to the person-number markers.","[141, 142, 143]"

4.2.5 Questions
Drabbe 1957: section 17, p. 9Interrogative nominal clauses are formed by means of the question particle
ka, as in (492), or by means of sentence final da xajo, where da is analyzed
as a copula, and xajo as a question particle, as in (493) and (494).209 The
optional use of the case markers te ‘NOM’ and the focus marker ke ‘FOC’ is
analogous to what was described for the affirmative counterparts.(492)      g-eto          ka.
           2SG-father     QST
           ‘Is it your father’? (Drabbe 1957:9a)
(493)      g-eto          (ke/te)           da    xajo
           2SG-father     (FOC/NOM)         COP   QST
           ‘Is it your father?’ (Drabbe 1957:9a)
(494)      amgiobü         da        xajo
           girl            COP       QST
           ‘Is it a girl?’ (Drabbe 1957:9a)
Interrogative adjectival clauses are formed by the use of the copula o(xo) or
a, followed by the question particle xajo. 210 The copula o(xo) is most
209
      For the analysis of ka, da and xajo, see also section 2.7.
210
      Drabbe remarks that ‘we do not find de (da) very often with adjectives’. This suggests
that it is possible, though rare, to form adjectival question clauses in the same way as
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure                                           293
commonly used after adjectives in -a, while the copula a is most common
after other adjectives.211(495)      tadixa      o(xo)     xajo

1.2.2 Syllable structure
Aghu syllable structure could possibly be rendered as in the following
figure:
24
     Drabbe gives quite a few instances of /jV/ and /wV/-initial words, but only the following
/iV/ and /üa/-initial words: io, ‘stone’, üaboxofi ‘lay down’. In these few instances, we can
contrast /j/ vs. /i/ and /u/ vs. /w/ in analogous environments: io ‘stone’ vs. jõ ‘copulate’ and
üaboxofi ‘lay down’ vs. wa ‘bad’.
25
     I have analyzed long vowels as VV. It is also possible, however, to analyze them as V. It
falls outside the scope of this book to go deeper into this question.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 1: Phonology                                   21
                    not in word-final position
(C)V(C[+nasal])
Figure 5: Aghu syllable structure
It should be noted that this syllable structure follows the assumption that
the vowel sequences given above are not part of the same syllable, but that
the second vowel of each sequence forms a syllable on its own (possibly
followed by a nasal consonant). Another option would be to consider the
vowel sequences described above as (possibly) part of one and the same
syllable, and to analyze them as sequences of two vowels. In that case,
Aghu syllable structure would have to be presented as follows:                               not in word-final position
(C)V(V)(C[+nasal])
Figure 6: alternative Aghu syllable structure1.2.3 Lexical stress
Lexical stress is on the last syllable of the word. Drabbe speaks of a “weak
accent.” Following Drabbe, I have not indicated stress in case it is
regular, and use an accent grave to indicate stress in irregular cases, as
in toxopòmu ‘some’. Scattered over the book, Drabbe gives several
examples of stress shift to the prefinal syllable caused by “a strong
connection between a word and another element.” A case in question is
the sequence sì-ke nisi [build-N1.RLS[SG]] ‘the one who builds’, where
stress has shifted from the suffix -ke to the stem (cf. Drabbe 1957:11).
22                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 1: Phonology
Another example is formed by the question particles ka and (a)xajo
discussed in 2.7.","[38, 39, 40]"
"In the section where Drabbe describes the use of predicative de after verbs
he also points to the use of mV ‘do’ as a predicator. The verb can be used
to predicate over adjectives and nouns. This is illustrated in (529) and
(530). Compared to ‘normal’ predication with de or oxo described in 4.2.1
and 4.2.2 above, the use of m-oxo plus copulative de emphasizes a
causative relation between the respective clause and the following:(529)   oxo      tadixa    m-oxo                 de      onu-d-oan=de            xo
        water    high      do-N1.RLS[SG]         COP     cross-1.RLS-1PL=NEG     COP
        ‘because the water was high we did not cross’ (Drabbe 1957:39b)
(530)   na      nagã      m-oxo                 de!
        1SG     wife      do-N1.RLS[SG]         COP
        ‘(The reason is that) she is my wife!’ (Drabe 1957a: 39b-40a)
In line with what was described for de in 4.3, here too it is possible to
embed a verbal clause. This is illustrated in (531) and (532).

         ‘I came in (into the house) because it was raining’ (Drabbe 1957:40a)
Moxo de can also take the position of xo in a negative construction, as is
clear from a comparison between the following two clauses:(533)a       nu     etosume-n=de          xo
             1SG    see.IT_II-VN=NEG      COP          kia           asi-n=de                        mu-ne

    clausesTo close off this chapter, this section compares the clauses discussed in 4.2
with those discussed in 4.3. The following two tables compare verbal and
non-verbal question clauses, negative clauses and positive clauses.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure                                             305
First consider question clauses, formed either by a combination of copula a
and question maker xajo or by a single question copula ka. Note that —
analogous to what we saw for the use of moxo de in 4.4 above — the
verbal clause fills the same structural slot as a nominal or adjectival phrase.","[321, 322, 323]"
"
Finally consider Table 31, which shows verbs followed by the predicator-
question particle combination a xajo. Note that a is usually elided after
vowels, but merges with final e. Main stress is the same as for the
construction with =ka in Table 30 above, except from the historical past
forms, where stress is on the verb stem and not on -dia.

N1PL        dàxenã xajo     dākenã xajo          dàdianã xajo        adenàna xajo
The following sentence illustrates the use of a xajo:(144)   gu       afì-n-a           xajo
        2SG      take-N1SG-FUT     QST
        ‘do you want to have it (lit. ‘will you accept it?’; Drabbe 1957:18a)
In the text corpus only one example of a verbal interrogative clause is
attested:(145)   Oxe:                   Kiawi,     gu      okag ̀mu          ièna
        o-xe                   Kiawi      gu      okag ̀mu          iè-n-a

        QST         such=speak-N1.RLS[SG]
        ‘He says: “Kiawi, will you stay there?”’ (2.198)
In negative questions, the question particle ka or xajo follows the negative
particle de. Note that in this context we find xajo as a surface form, not *a
xajo, and that the copula xo — which is used in analogous positive clauses
— is not used. Drabbe gives the following two examples:

        ‘shall we not go?’ (Drabbe 1957:18a)2.8 Posture verbs
Drabbe 1957: sections 78-88, p.31-36Following Drabbe, who devotes 11 sections to the verbs ba(x) ‘sit’, e(k)
‘stand’, and i(g) ‘lie’, this book also devotes a separate section to the
discussion of posture verbs. Following a brief introduction about irregular
inflections, section 2.8.1 offers a discussion of the meaning and use of
posture verbs as lexical verbs. Section 2.8.2 shows instances where posture
verbs are developing into a copula, but where the meaning aspect of posture
is still part of their lexical entry. Section 2.8.3, finally, considers several
other types of verbs derived from posture verbs and their uses.","[144, 145, 146]"
"Very similar to the nonverbal clauses discussed in the previous session are
those which are formed with the use of the copula verb ki(k) ‘become’.
Following Dixon’s analysis of copula clauses, one could consider these
clauses as headed by a copula verb ki(k) which takes two complements: a
copula subject and a copula complement (Dixon 2010b:159f). This copula
can be a noun, an adjective or a numeral. Unlike the copula clauses
discussed above, the verb can be inflected not also for person and number
of the subject, but also for tense and mood, which makes that the clauses
under discussion here can also be used to invoke a future interpretation.
When combined with adjectives or numerals, the copula may be interpretednominal question clauses, namely by means of da xajo. Drabbe’s description contains no
examples, however.
211
      Drabbe does not refer to a as a copula, but as “possibly not more than a ligature”, and
refers to the use of a in questioning verbs (see 2.7).
294                                 PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure
either as a ‘being’ or as ‘becoming’, as can be seen in the different
translations of the examples given below.(498)    na        xü             tadixa   ki-ke

         ‘the musquitos are many’ / (the musquitos have become many)’ (Drabbe 1957:9b)
With a nominal complement, the only possible interpretation of ki(k) is
‘become’; for the notion of being, one uses the verb positional verbs ba(x)
‘sit’ etc., more on which can be found in section 2.8.2. The following two
examples exemplify the contrast between the use of ki(k) and the use of
ba(x).(503)    aki=            ò-xo-nisi                      ki-ke

The verb ki(k) is also used in combination with nonfinite realis forms.
Drabbe gives the following three examples, and writes that “one should
note that in all cases it is about a totality” (Drabbe 1957:40a).(505)      efe      gõ            isiom=       mi-di            kike

    ending in de
Drabbe 1957: section 97, p39b-40aIn sections 2.6 and 2.7, it was shown how verbal clauses may be embedded
in an interrogative or negative non-verbal clause, by the use of a copulative
xo (a)xajo ‘QST’ or ka ‘QST’. Here I would like to discuss another example
of embedded clauses, namely those embedded in copula clauses ending in
de.212 Consider the following example:212
      Drabbe explicitly states that “predicative de” can only be used after semifinite (realis
and irrealis) forms, not after future forms. An example like (513) below, however, seems
to contradict his claim, as we do find an embedded future there.
296                              PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure(508)      o-xo                  de          da-de
           speak-N1.RLS[SG]      COP         come-1.RLS[SG]
           ‘I came because he asked me’ (Drabbe 1957:39b)
Drabbe contrasts the sentence above to (509) below, where one uses the
different-subject marker -ne. Compared to (509), sentence (508) stresses the
reason or the ground for coming: it is because he asked me that I came.(509)      o-xo-ne                    da-de
           speak-N1.RLS[SG]-DS        come-1.RLS[SG]
           ‘he asked me and I came’ (Drabbe 1957:39b)
I follow Drabbe in analyzing de as a copula.213 As the number of examples
given by Drabbe is limited, and as we have only few examples of this
construction in the text corpus, it is hard to characterize the precise function
of this construction. It can at least be said that speakers may embed verbal
clauses of different moods, including content questions. In (510)-(512) and
(515) we find realis verbal clauses (serving as an assertion), while (513) is
an example of an embedded irrealis. In (514) we have to do with a (realis)
content question (more on which will be said below). Example (516) and
(517), finally, are examples of embedded imperative clauses. In order to
clarify the structure of the clauses, I have given both a translation that
follows the Aghu structure quite closely, and a more liberal rendering.(510)     üfü-du           de          efe     wusoxo    xaimenaŋ   gi-ke
          hit-1.RLS[SG]    COP         3SG     body      pain       become-1.RLS[SG]
          ‘it is (because): I hit him and his body became painful’ ⇒ ‘his body is
          painful because I hit him’ Drabbe 1957:39b)
213
      Drabbe states literally that these sentences should be analyzed as verbal clauses thate
are “predicated again” by the use of de (Drabbe 1957:40)

298                              PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure
In the text corpus, verbal clauses embedded in a clause ending in de are
few. A clear example is found in the myth on the two brothers, where the
younger brother commands his brother twice to let loose of his scrotum.(518)      nēxo,                midik                      ena             de
           n-ēxo                mi-di=k                    ena             de
           1SG-elder.brother     come.down-SS=CON           stand.IMP[SG]   COP
           ‘my elder brother, you [let loose and] come down and stand’ (3.140, repeated
           in 3.158)
In order to better grasp the function of embedding verbal clauses in copula
clauses ending in de, it is important to note that the copula here stands in a
paradigmatic relation with negative de xo ‘NEG COP’; with interrogative ka /
(a)xajo ‘QST’, and with counterfactual fini oxo ‘CFT COP’, more on which
can be found in 5.5.2. Especially informative is the contrast between open
questions and polar questions. Open questions begin with a question word,
and are optionally embedded in a copula clause ending in de, as illustrated
in (514) above, and (519) below. Closed or polar questions, however, are
embedded in clauses ending in ka or (a)xajo, as can be seen in (520)(519)     makum                axì-n-e          de
          how/where/when       go_II-N1SG-FUT   COP
          ‘(it is:) where will you go?’ (Drabbe 1957:40a)
(520)     dà-xe=ka
          come-N1.RLS[SG]=QST
          ‘(is it:) ‘he is coming’ ⇒ ‘is he going to come?’ (Drabbe 1957:17a)
Compared to polar questions, in which the entire state of affairs is
questioned, here we have a given state of affairs, in which it is one
information gap that is emphasized. 214 Two further examples of verbal214
      It should be noted that there is a fundamental difference between these two types of
predicates. The use of de implies that the event has taken place, is taking place, or is

clauses embedded in de-copula clauses are the following. Note the use of
the focus marker ke in (522), which might be here taken as implying a
contrast.(521)     ek’               üfü-oxe-nã

Grammatical tense plays only a minor role in Aghu. Although the language
has a category of fully finite verbs, which bear a formal expression of tense
(historical past, distant past or future), these finite verbs are attested very
rarely in the texts available to us. The texts contain only four cases of a
future tense, historical past verbs are attested only in the concluding
sections of the narratives, while distant past tense forms are found
predominantly in contexts where the distant past meaning has bleached (cf.
2.3.3.1 example (65); 2.4.3.3 examples (105) and (107)). It is important to
be aware, however, that the text corpus is highly biased, as it contains only
very little direct speech. In fact, all four examples of future tense forms in
the text corpus are found in quoted direct speech, which makes it very
likely that investigation of Aghu daily conversation would yield a much
higher frequency of future forms compared to the frequency in Drabbe’s
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                         31
corpus. Whether this is also true for the different past tenses is a question
that cannot be answered.","[48, 49]"
"
A clause can be defined as “the linguistic expression of a proposition”
(Payne 1997:71). In the present study, a verbal clause may contain
maximally one inflected verb: a nonfinite, semifinite or fully finite verb.
Sequences of verbs within one sentence are referred to as ‘clause chains’ or
even sequences of clause chains, more on which can be found in Chapter 5.
The first section of this chapter discusses verbal clauses (with the exception
of those headed by the copula verb ki(k) ‘become’), while the second
section deals with nonverbal clauses: nominal, adjectival and numeral
clauses. The second section closes with a section on clauses headed by the
copula verb ki(k). The remainder of the chapter will deal with a number of
other phenomena that operate at clause level. Section 4.6, finally, will
summarize the similarities and differences between the types of clauses that
were discussed: verbal and non-verbal positive, negative and question
clauses.",[289]

They come and say, they say to the old Apupüsimo: ""our mother and our father,
where are they (lit. they are)?"", so they say.
For ioxe Drabbe refers to section 81 in his grammatical introduction
(Drabbe 1957ː33), where he states that the form is a 'defective' form of
io(x) 'be present'. See also section 2.8.3.2.
Although Aghu has grammaticalized ways of marking a question (for which
see section 2.7), these are not used here. Note, however, that in many
languages intonation is one of the ways to mark questions, and that we do
not have any information about the intonation of this sentence (neither

of -de, while the N1SG semifinite realis suffix -oxe alternates with oxo- (cf.

"As was stated in 3.1.7 and 3.6, there are good reasons to analyze te and ke
as case markers. Here I will defend this analysis, but show that they also
have a pragmatic function, which I tentatively describe as ‘focused’. I will
also explain why I analyze ke in certain contexts as a focus marker rather
than a case marker.
expected to take place. The use of ka or axajo puts in question whether the event has taken
place, is taking place or will take place. One might say that the use of de implies a high
degree of authority from the side of the speaker for the truth of the proposition, while polar
questions hand the authority for the truth of the proposition over to the addressee. Cf.
Timberlake (2007: 315f.).
215
      This is the only case where I have analyzed eke as an accusative; in all other cases it
has been analyzed as a 3SG pronoun plus focus, and glossed as 3SG.FOC; cf. 3.2.3.1.
300                             PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structureThe most convincing arguments in favor of ke and te as case markers are
the following. First, Drabbe gives some contrastive examples in which the
markers serve to disambiguate between the syntactic roles of subject and
object. A very convincing example, which was given in 3.1.5 and is
repeated here, is the following:(523)a   na         n-amse        t=       ed-oxe-nã
         1SG.POS    LNK-child     NOM      give-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘my children gave it’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)

         1SG.POS   LNK-child      ACC     give-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
Second, the case markers are in complementary distribution with other case
markers, discussed in 3.6.","[317, 318]"
"
Drabbe’s description of Aghu started off as a follow up to an earlier article
on the Pisa and Sjiagha “dialects of the Awyu language” (Drabbe 1950). In
the preface to Spraakkunst van het Aghu, Drabbe writes that after
publication of the respective article, he was asked from different sides to
provide original material to illustrate the “grammatical rules.” In answer to
this question, Drabbe started collecting texts in what he calls “a third
dialect of the Awyu language”, with the aim to publish them as an
illustration of his 1950 article. During the process of collection, however,
Drabbe discovered that the dialect was so different from the other two, that
the texts could not serve the original aim, and even justified the publication
of a separate language description or spraakkunst:“Hereby we offer this [language description] to the practitioners of linguistics, together
with some texts as an appendix, with interlinear literal translation and some notes”1
1
    “We bieden die thans de beoefenaars der taalwetenschap aan, tezamen met een aantal teksten
als aanhangsel, en wel met interlineaire letterlijke vertaling en enige nota’s.” (Drabbe 1957:iii)

From the study of Drabbe’s work, I have come to know Drabbe as an
outstanding scholar, with a fine eye for the character and own ‘peculiarity’
of individual languages. As a Roman Catholic priest, Drabbe had received a
decent training in classical languages, and it is this background that
provided Drabbe with the tools he used to produce his language
descriptions. The fact that Drabbe had not received a formal linguistic
training at academic level, at times seems to have been a cause of tension in
the contemporary acceptance of his work. The following 1957 preface gives
some insight into the dynamics of this discussion, and may also serve as a
justification of the present ‘re-publication’ of Drabbe’s work.","[5, 6]"
"

     In fact, the data provided by Drabbe are too limited to decide when we have to do with a
phonologically dependent realization (a clitic) or a phonologically independent realization
of ka. While Drabbe writes ka as a suffix in combination with a verbal clause, and as a
separate word when following a nominal or adjectival clause, I have consistently written ka
as a clitic.

"
When used as arguments in verbal clauses, the interrogative pronouns
behave the same as nouns. They optionally combine with the nominative or
accusative cases markers te NOM or ke ACC, as can be seen in (264) and
(265)a-c below. Note that, parallel to what we saw for full NP’s in 3.1.7, te
is used to mark either an intransitive subject (as in (264)) or a transitive
subject (as in (265)a and b), while ke is used to mark an object. As is clear
from (265)a-c, the function of the case marker is to disambiguate between
different syntactic roles. The fact, however, that it is also possible to use a
case marker in (264) — where the syntactic role of meoxo is not ambiguous
— shows that it must also have a pragmatic function.154(264)       meoxo    (te)       da-xe
            who      (NOM)      come-N1.RLS[SG]

154
      Cf. the discussion of te in 3.1.7, especially example (222).
200                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesc         meoxo     ke      ü-ge

          ‘*Who has stabbed someone?’ / Whom has he stabbed)?’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)
As can be seen in (266)a - c below, in nominal predicates, interrogative
pronouns obligatorily combine with te or ke. In this respect, they differ
from nouns, where the use of te or ke is optional. The difference between
the use of te and ke is not clear, but their function is clearly not to
differentiate between different syntactic roles. It is more likely that their use
has to do with the type of focus, but we have insufficient data to say
anything more about the respective roles of ke and te with any certainty.155(266)a     *meoxo     de
           who        COP
           * ‘who is it’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)

           ‘who is it’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)
155
      Interrogative pronouns are focused in the sense that they represent the ‘component of
(...) the proposition whereby the assertion [WvdH: in this case expressed by the question
word] differs from the presupposition [WvdH: the fact that there is someone]’ (cf.
Lambrecht 1994:213). This may explain the use of ke. Whereas te is not a focus marker, it
is not incompatible with focus, and it is not unthinkable that te would represent a different
tye of focus than ke, like presentational or thetic focus, with the focus on the predicate as a
whole. With the little data that we have, however, we can only speculate about this
difference.

Drabbe also gives a number of examples where the interrogative pronoun
meoxo is used to refer to the possessor in a possessive construction. First
consider (267) and (268), where the latter gives two possible answers to the
former.(267)       gu          meoxo        n-axu           de156
            2SG         who          LNK-human       COP
            ‘what clan do you belong to or where are you from?’
            (lit. ‘whose person are you?’; Drabbe 1957:27a)
(268)      Eba                     n-axu         de /        Xoxonasàfo        n-axu       de
           name.of.river           LNK-human     COP         Xoxonasàfo        LNK-human   COP
           ‘I am from the area of the Eba-river’ /
            ‘I am someone from the Xoxonasàfo clan (Drabbe 1957:27a)
Two other question-answer pairs are the following:(269)       gu     meoxo      xu       de /      gu          meoxo       siü     de
            2SG    who        man      COP       2SG         who         woman   COP
            ‘whose man are you?’ / ‘whose woman are you?’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)
(270)      Mā     xu          de      / Magubo       siü           de
           Ma     man         COP     Magubo         woman         COP
           ‘I am a man from the Mã clan’
            / ‘I am a woman from (the place) Magubo’(Drabbe 1957:27a)
Examples (271) through (273) form two final examples of interrogatives
referring to possessors. Note that (273) is an example of a possessive
construction embedded in another expression.","[217, 218, 219]"
"
Before we go deeper into to the distributional properties of verbal nouns,
first some words need to be devoted to their semantics. If we take a verb
with a basic lexical meaning X, a verbal noun formed from lexeme X
usually refers to ‘the activity or event of X-ing’. With certain verbs,
however, the verbal noun may also refer to what Drabbe calls the result of a
process (1957:15), or to what could tentatively be called the ‘effected49
     That stems in e have verbal nouns in ã or ẽ with different distribution raises the question
whether it wouldn’t make more sense to speak of two types of ‘verbal nouns’ with
different function. For stems in e these two types would then be distinguished formally,
while for stems that end in other vowels the types would have no formal distinction.
Before deciding to reanalyze Drabbe’s data at this point, one would first have to consider
the question whether the alternation between ã and ẽ could not be explained on the basis of
the phonological environment in which the two alternants are used (vowel harmony, stress
pattern). As the data are too limited to investigate the influence of the phonological
environment, however, I have decided to follow Drabbe’s analysis.
50
     More precisely, Drabbe speaks of ‘nominal use of the future stem’. Drabbe’s formulation
betrays two aspects where the analysis here differs from his: (1) where he speaks of future
stems, we speak of irrealis stems or stems of type II; (2) for Drabbe, the forms under
discussion coincide with the stem, as for him the future stems or stems of type II discussed
in 2.2, Table 3, end in a nasal, cf. also footnote 33.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                        55
object’ or ‘affected subject’. He gives some examples of effected objects of
transitive verbs: ga noŋgã [2SG LNK-carve_II.VN] ‘your carved.work’; efe
tamã [3SG write_II.VN] ‘his written work’; na soxo kumã [1SG ground
put_II.VN] ‘my planted.work’. Later on, Drabbe gives a number of verbal
nouns “that can be rendered in Dutch by a past participle” (Drabbe
1957:16), and which designate ‘affected subjects’. Thus, we have axu
akümã [human die_II.VN] ‘dead person’; genimiã [clip_II.VN] ‘stump (e.g. of
arm)’; ān-afi [woman-take_II.VN] ‘married man’ and xu-afi [man-take_II.VN]
‘married woman’.","[72, 73]"

this publication or sections in Drabbe are printed in the position following
the English translation (e.g. 1.135 etc. at a(x)). Numbers in non-bold font
refer to sections in the text corpus or in the grammatical introduction,
dependent on the structure of the code. References to the English-Aghu
wordlist, on the other hand, are given in bold font. The absence of numbers
in non-bold font means that the morpheme in question was attested in the
wordlist only. This is the case, for example, for adena above, which only
has a reference to the wordlist, in bold font: 029. Likewise, absence of a
introduction uses small caps to grammatical functions, the wordlist and texts use ‘normal’
capitals.

Note that most of the verbs listed above have, in addition to the

in the b- example, however, is harder to define. If we consider joxo te as
the subject — which is what I would propose, given its marking as

kinoxo? I will leave this question for further research.","[299, 300]"

Comparison of these two examples confirms that the main function of the
durative is to express the internal temporal structure of the event, as an
activity with a certain duration; the question of overlap with neighboring
events is not part of its meaning, but a matter of inference from the context.
It is also possible, however, that the different durative constructions (the
morphological duratives given in Table 15, durative with particle bu and
analytic duratives) differ at this point, in that some imply overlap and some
do not. Unfortunately, the data are insufficient at this point.","[108, 109]"

      Dixon stresses that case may be expressed in different ways: either as affixes (ideally
and typically called case inflection, or as clitics (ideally called case clitics, typically called
case or apposition), or — as is the case in Aghu — as grammatical words, in which case
they are ideally called case words, and typically called adpositions. This book uses the
term postpositional case marker, to express both its realization as a grammatical word that

Before coming to a one by one discussion, it is helpful to first give some
general properties of the postpositional case markers listed above, to
delineate them from members of other word classes. The defining
properties of the markers above are the following:
       -   They appear in final position of the phrase.
       -   They mark the syntactic or semantic relation between the noun
           phrase and the verbal predicate.
       -   Their use is generally optional, at least in certain contexts.179178
      In his discussion of “schakelelementen” Drabbe also mentions maga, used only in
combination with to ‘opening’ (Drabbe 1957:43a). To maga, then, is translated by Drabbe
as ‘in the opening’ or ‘at the door’. This maga is probably better analyzed as spatial noun
(3.5.2), rather than as a postpositional case marker.
179
      Here we are limited because of a lack of data, and suffer especially from the lack of
data obtained from independent fieldwork. One of the most straightforward ways to find
out whether a morpheme is optional, is to present an informant with both options, and ask
for the acceptability and meaning of both cases. Given that we lack this type of data, we
may conclude that the use of a morpheme is optional only in those cases where Drabbe´s
corpus happens to provide contrasting examples. And even then we do not know whether
there might be a subtle meaning difference going along with the use or non-use of the
morpheme in question.
242                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
The case markers te and ke were dealt with in 3.1.7, where it was shown
that they answer all three criteria mentioned here: they are used
postnominally, they mark the (semantic or) syntactic relation between the
predicate and the noun, and their use is optional. We now turn to a
discussion of the other postpositional case markers.","[258, 259, 260]"
"If we follow this definition, it is immediately clear that Aghu ‘clause
chains’ as defined in 5.1 do not always answer the definition given by
Longacre. On the one hand, most Aghu ‘clause chains’ do fit the definition,
namely those which consist of a final semifinite verb and one or more
preceding nonfinite SS forms. They fit the definition because nonfinite SS
forms have ‘more restricted features’, lacking the inflection for person and
number of the subject that is found on semifinites. On the other hand, quite
a few Aghu ‘clause chains’ contain more than one semifinite verb, and
these clearly fall outside Longacre’s definition. For Longacre, it is
impossible for verbs of the same unrestricted type to be used in sequence
within one and the same chain (2007:375). That this is perfectly possible in
Aghu, however, is clearly illustrated in the following example. Here we
first find a sequence of SS forms (adek badek), then a clause headed by the
semifinite form pemoxe, which is followed by another semifinite form:
mike
(534)   Adek                  badek           kufe       xabã      pemoxe

           come.down-N1.RLS[SG]
           ‘He takes hold (of the head) and sits down and casts the enemy's head and it comes
           down.’ (1.190)
According to Longacre’s definition, only those Aghu ‘clause chains’ with
one, final, semifinite (or finite) verb and preceded by one or more nonfinite
verbs would qualify as clause chains. Interestingly, however, Aghu ‘clause
chains’ share two additional features that — according to Longacre — are
frequently found in and characterize clause chaining languages (cf.
Longacre 2007:399)222:
       -    Clause chaining languages often have a switch reference system;
            Aghu can be analyzed as having a rudimentary switch reference
            system.
       -    A further characteristic of clause chaining can be the marking of
            clauses for temporality: the question whether two events overlap or
            take place in chronological succession. In Aghu this marking for
            temporality is found in the type of clause chains that are discussed
            in 5.4.2. This type of clause chains is rather rare, however.","[328, 329]"
"
In the following two sentences, makumaŋ and manmaŋ are used as copula
complements. Drabbe gives no example of makumu here, which might
again be seen as a confirmation of the more adverbial nature of makumu (as
the language has no other examples of adverbial copula complements) and
the more nominal nature of makumaŋ and mamaŋ.(297)a    geto           fi       mamaŋ          ge         de
          your.father    name     how/where      FOC        COP

  b      geto           fi       makumaŋ              ge          de

         ‘what’s your father’s name?’ (Drabbe 1957:28a)
In addition to the verbal noun makumã, Drabbe also points at the existence
of a question verb makumu ‘do what’. To illustrate its use, Drabbe contrasts
the verb makumoxenã to the homophonous makum= oxenã, as illustrated
in (298) and (299) below.(298)    makum=                  o-xe-nã
         what/where/when=        speak-N1.RLS-N1PL

         ‘what did they do?’ (Drabbe 1957:27b)
The following example has been taken from the text corpus:

Twice we find the form maketa, a form which is not further discussed by
Drabbe, and which he glosses as ‘where’, and ‘whence’, without any further
comments. The two occasions where they are attested have been rendered
here as (301) and (302).","[226, 227]"

5 Clause combinations
5.1 Sentences as combinations of clauses or clause
    chainsIf we study the text corpus as published in Drabbe (1957), it is clear that for
Drabbe, Aghu clauses generally combine into larger units: A sentence,
marked by a capital at the beginning and a full stop in the end, often
comprises more than one clause. Some sentences are subdivided
orthographically into smaller units by the use of semicolons or comma’s.
Although Drabbe’s (1957) description lacks an explanation of the use of
diacritic signs, I assume that semicolons and commas generally refer to the
presence of a pause in the spoken text, probably going along with a certain
intonational pattern.219 We do not have any information, however, on the
type of intonational pattern(s) going with these pauses, and neither do we
know what motivated Drabbe’s choice between a full stop, a comma, or a
semicolon. For reasons to be explained below, we will refer to the units
demarcated by Drabbe that consist of more than one clause as clause
chains. This can be represented as follows:
219
      I admit, however, that one cannot exclude the possibility that Drabbe was led (also) by
the logical relations holding between sentence parts, rather than by intonational patterns.

3.8.1 Conjunctions conjoining noun phrases
Drabbe 1957: section 103f, p. 42bThe two conjunctions used to conjoin (nouns or) noun phrases are kini ‘or’
and ko ‘and’. In a series of conjoined elements, both kini and ko follow
each of the conjoined elements, as indicated in the following figure:
187
      The form is, most probably, historically related to amu ‘flesh’ or ‘meat’. Although it
should be distinguished from namu ‘WITH’, in many contexts stress on nàmu is not
realized, so that the two forms are formally undistinguishable (cf. 3.6.1.2 above).

          ‘will you eat bananas, or tuber, or sago?’ (Drabbe 1957:42b)
The use of ko can be observed in (404), while (405) illustrates that ko is
also used to connect pronouns.(404)     efe      xasi     ko,      efe         dibisi   ko,        efe      tetabago   ko

Drabbe writes that Noun Phrases are sometimes also conjoined
asyndetically, but does not give any examples. As stated above, the text188
      From Drabbe’s description, it is not clear whether kini should be taken as disjunctive
(‘and /or’, so that the question reads as: bananas, and/or tuber, and/or sago) or exclusive
(‘or’, so that the parts are mutually exclusive: either bananas, or tuber, or sago).
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                     257
corpus likewise lacks examples of conjoined Noun Phrases. As an
alternative to conjoined noun phrase, we find examples like (406) below.
There we can observe an asyndetic repetition of the same verb axe ‘he
takes’ with a different object: first xabü ‘stone axe’, and then motü ‘sack’.
This example is in line with a general tendency in Papuan languages to
limit the number of NP’s per clause, and to distribute nominals over
different clauses (cf. de Vries 2006:813).","[273, 274, 275]"

3 Other word classes
3.1 Nouns and noun phrasesAghu has very few morphological processes operating on nouns. The only
ones are: (1) plural suffixation, on a very restricted set of kinship terms and
nouns denoting humans (3.1.5.1), and (2) suffixation with a possessive
linker, on vowel-initial nouns in possessive constructions (3.1.2; 3.2.2).
There are no productive processes of noun formation, except from
compounding, which is the topic of the following section.107
3.1.1 Compounding
Drabbe 1957: section 7, p. 4a-bThe Aghu language has two types of nominal compounds, illustrated in the
following figure. In both constructions, the modifying noun has main
stress.108
107
      Cf., however, section 2.3.2.2 on verbal nouns, formed on the basis of irrealis stems and
exhibiting certain nominal properties.
108
      Drabbe speaks of woordaccent ‘word accent’. He also remarks that compounds of type
1 are found in “all Papuan languages”, and that they are also found in the Germanic
languages.

Cross-linguistically, in compounds the exact semantic relation between the
constituents is often a matter of interpretation by the language user (Booij
2005:75). Language users have to interpret the relationship on the basis of
the meaning of the composing parts, their knowledge of the world, and
sometimes on the basis of the context. At the same time, one may think of
certain types of compounds as imposing a ‘semantic scheme’ on the
composing parts and or on the resultant meaning. This scheme may be
rather loose, and put only few restrictions on the possible range of
constituents, or rather strict, allowing only for certain constituents, and
specifying the semantic relation between the parts as well as the meaning of
the whole. If we compare the two types of compounds in Aghu, it seems
that those of type 2 are more specific or answer to a stricter scheme than
those of type 1. For compounds of type 2, Drabbe gives the following three
subtypes, with a strictly defined range of possible constituents — fillers of
the N1 and N2 positions in the figure below — and a strictly defined
relation between the two composing parts. . Drabbe is not explicit about the
question whether the modifying elements in these compounds are also
attested as separate words.

Some examples of type 2 compounds are the following. Siü is the general
name for ‘banana’, while the compound siü-mĩ refers to a ‘mĩ-banana’.
Wisi is a general name for snakes, lizards and crocodiles, and is used in
compounds like wisi-anù ‘anu-lizard’; wisi-künü ‘künü-snake’. The general
name for marsupials, little bears, rats and mice is kuso, and is used in
compounds like kuso-bax ̀ ‘kangaroo’; kuso-kamà ‘cuscus’; kuso-maxikò
‘field mouse’. The noun ̄ is found in virtually all bird names, e.g. in i-wiã
‘owl’; i-skamiaxà ‘duck’; i-soxù ‘hornbill’ (Dutch: neushoornvogel). 109

constituent that specifies the kind of fish, as in axe-fifiò ‘fisio-fish’; axe-mü
‘mü-fish’. Coming to the names for parts of the arm and leg, we find bedo
‘hand’ or kito ‘foot’ plus specifications, as in bedo-butõ ‘finger’; bedo-
wodò ‘thumb’; bedo-gõ ‘wrist’; kito-babù ‘sole’; kito-baxamgò ‘lower leg’;
kito-sigiã ‘small toe’.","[161, 162, 163, 164, 165]"
"“There is another desire which, unfortunately, also this time we couldn’t fulfill. One would
want us to provide many and exact phonetic data about the languages whose grammatical
structure we analyze and describe; ideally, one would like to see these data accompanied
by an analysis of the phonological structure. We fully acknowledge this desire as justified,
but are not capable to meet this desire, as we know that we are not competent. Although it
is, in principle, possible to learn what one does not know, given our age and the amount of
work it would take to do such a study, which — if one wants it to lead to the desired
results — would take a lot of time, we think we serve the interests of our mission — our
primary aim — better if we spend the rest of the time that will be given to us in the same
way as before. Although we acknowledge the desire mentioned above as justified, and
although we acknowledge that our work will also in the future, seen from a scientific
perspective, contain a gap, we are nevertheless of the opinion — and we are not alone in
this — that our labour is not without merit for linguistics.”22
    “Aan een andere wens konden we helaas ook ditmaal niet voldoen. Men zou gaarne zien, dat we in
ruime mate exacte fonetische gegevens verstrekten over de talen, waarvan we de grammaticale
grondstructuur ontleden en beschrijven; liefst zou men deze gegevens nog vergezeld zien gaan van
een analyse der fonologische structuur. We erkennen ten volle het rechtmatige van dit verlangen,
maar zijn niet bij machte eraan tegemoet te komen, daar we ons incompetent weten. Weliswaar kan
men leren wat men niet weet, doch gezien enerzijds onze leeftijd en anderzijds de omvang van een
dergelijke studie, die — wil ze tot de gewenste resultaten leiden — geruime tijd in beslag zou nemen,
menen we de belangen van het missiewerk — ons eerste doel — beter te dienen, door de tijd die ons
nog geschonken zal worden, te besteden als voorheen. Het rechtmatige van bovengenoemd verlangen
erkennend, en toegevend, dat ons werk ook in de toekomst, van wetenschappelijk standpunt bekeken,
een lacune zal blijven vertonen, menen we toch — en we staan daarin niet alleen — dat onze arbeid
niet zonder waarde is voor de taalwetenschap.” (Drabbe 1957:iii)
viDrabbe concludes his preface with the following words:“Where our opponent [Prof E.M. Ühlenbeck] rightly signals the lack of exact phonetic
signs as a lacuna in our work — but, in our opinion, values this too highly — his judgment
should be explained not out of prejudice or bias, but out of his great enthusiasm for
structural linguistics. We can fully appreciate this enthusiasm, as we too consider a
structural analysis to be necessary, if one really wants to bring all secrets of a language to
the surface of conscious knowledge. We would therefore be delighted if the work, with
which we only made a beginning, would, in this spirit, be brought to completion by
others.”3
Although this book does not work within the paradigm of structural
linguistics that was current in the Fifties, it shares the same enthusiasm to
bring all secrets of the Aghu language, as hidden in this Spraakkunst, to the
surface. Not only to be seen by those who are competent in Dutch or those
who manage to get hold of a copy, but by all those who, with Drabbe,
would like to know more about this language, because“Each language is a fascinating miracle, and because it is an intense joy to analyze
such a miracle, as one repeatedly does new and unexpected discoveries.” 4
3
    Waar onze opponent het ontbreken van exacte fonetische gegevens terecht signaleert als een lacune
in ons werk, doch naar onze mening dit al te zwaar laat wegen, moet zijn oordeel verklaard worden
niet uit vooringenomenheid of partijdigheid, maar uit zijn grote enthousiasme voor de structurele
taalwetenschap, een enthousiasme, dat we ten volle kunnen waarderen, omdat ook wij een structurele
analyse als noodzakelijk beschouwen, wil men uiteindelijk erin slagen alle geheimen van een taal aan
de oppervlakte der bewuste kennis te brengen. Het zou ons dan ook ten zeerste verheugen, wanneer
anderen de arbeid, waarmede wij slechts een aanvang maakten, in deze geest zouden kunnen
voltooien” (Drabbe 1957:iv).
4
    “…[omdat] iedere taal een boeiend wonder is, en het een intens genoegen is zo een wonder te
ontleden, doordat men telkens nieuwe en onverwachte ontdekkingen doet” (Drabbe 1965: 27).

This book and Drabbe s Spraakkunst
The present book can be seen as an adaptation of Drabbe’s 1957
Spraakkunst van het Aghu-dialect van de Awju-taal. It is intended to make
the entire text collection, all lexical material, and the grammatical analysis
of Drabbe (1957) available to a wider public, including those who are not
competent in Dutch. Although the present book is entirely based on Drabbe
(1957), and generally follows his grammatical analysis rather closely, at
points I have added some of my own insights, or tried to make a connection
with relevant developments in linguistic theory that have taken place since
the Fifties (e.g. a growing understanding of clause chaining and switch
reference).","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"
Nevertheless, the case markers are somewhat atypical. First, they are
optional, so that the following sentence, minimally differing from (523)a
and b, is also grammatical.  c      na        n-amse               ed-oxe-nã
         1SG.POS   LNK-child            give-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘my children gave it / they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
Their optional nature raises the question about the precise motivation for
their use. One might hypothesize that they are used only when an NP’s
function is not clear from the context. This cannot explain, however, why it
is also possible to use these markers in case the verb has only one
argument, whose role can only be that of a subject, as in the following
example:
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure                                           301(524)      na         n-amse          te       da-xe-nã
           1SG.POS    LNK-child       NOM      come-N1.RLS-N1PL
           ‘my children have come’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
This example shows that the use of te cannot fully be explained from its
function as disambiguator between the syntactic roles of subject and object;
it must also have a pragmatic function. As our data are too limited — we
especially lack minimally contrastive examples and descriptions of their
meaning differences — we have to remain ignorant about the nature of this
pragmatic function. In verbal clauses, therefore, we analyze te and ke as
case markers, the use of which is also guided by pragmatic factors that
remain to be investigated.216
In nonverbal clauses, the use of te and ke again is optional, except in
clauses with meoxo ‘who’ as a subject, where it is obligatory.217 As was
shown in 4.2, both te and ke may be used either in subject position or as
marker of the copula complement. Te is consistently analyzed as a
nominative marker. Ke, however, is analyzed as a a focus marker. This
shown in the following table:Table 54: Analysis of ke and te in nonverbal clauses
                           te, analyzed as                   ke analyzed as
In subject position        Nominative case marker            Focus marker
As a complement            Nominative case marker            Focus marker
Considering ke in subject position, my main argument to analyze it as a
focus marker is of a negative nature, in that it is hard to think of ke as an
accusative marker:
216
      An interesting example of the use of ke is found in 3.024, which was cited in 4.1 above,
example (452).","[318, 319]"

Now consider Table 27 below. This table shows that there is a certain
asymmetry, within the domain of irrealis forms, between positive sentences
and negative sentences when we consider their relation to mood. The
relation between finiteness and mood in positive sentences was discussed in
2.3.1.4 above: finite future forms only allow for a declarative reading, while
semifinite forms are used for optative modality, volitive modality (strong
intention) or may even have a declarative-affirmative reading; see the
second column in the table below.

"Summary of 2.175 to 2.186. He goes down along the high shore of a swamp, and sees
people walking ahead of him. These people see a certain Kiawi at a canoe, and ask him
to take them to the other side. Kiawi does what they ask, and then rows back to the
middle of the swamp. He hears Apupüsimo coming, who asks him: where are my
enemies? Kiawi answers: they have crossed at the tree that lies across in the water over
there.",[596]

      The hypothesis that we have to do with grammaticalized forms which are no longer in a
productive relation to the shorter form is reinforced by the fact that the longer forms are no
longer fully predictable from the shorter forms, e.g. botu corresponds to boteaxa not
*botuaxa, and bodü corresponds to bodixa not *bodüaxa. We find the same axV and oxo in
the question words meoxo ‘who’ and makeaxe ‘what’, discussed in 3.2.5.1.

1. Drabbe makes a distinction between adverbs that modify adjectives and adverbs that
modify verbs. That certain adverbs may also serve to modify an other adverb, a clause /
sentence or another noun, has been added by Wilco van den Heuvel, on the basis of the
data attested in the corpus. The adverbs da, tafeaxa and xati are not mentioned by Drabbe
in his discussion of adverbs. 2. Drabbe is not consistent in rendering stress for this word,
which may indicate that it alternates. In this book, the form is consistently rendered as
isiomu, except when citing examples provided by Drabbe. 3. Xati seems to indicate the
repetition of an earlier event. It is also used in cases where the same event is performed on
a different object, e.g. in 2.094, where first some moldered wood is brought up, and now
(again / also) a stick. In such cases, we would use 'also' in English, instead of 'again'. This
might be seen as an indication that xati (in these cases) modifies the verb (only the
bringing up is modified), and not the entire clause (which includes the object).

3.4.1 Modifiers of adjectives
Drabbe 1957: section 75, p. 30a-bAs intensifiers of adjectives we find xajã ‘really’, püsiü ‘very’ or püsiüaxa
‘very’ and isiomu ‘very/all’, all of which Drabbe proposes to gloss as
‘very’. In all the examples provided by Drabbe, the adjectives are used
predicatively. Xajã ‘very’ and püsiü ‘very’ are also attested as adjectives:
xajã ‘real’ and püsiü ‘big’. Isiomu is placed before the adjective that it
modifies, while the other forms follow the adjective. As can be seen in
(307), the pre-adjectival and post-adjectival adverbs can also be combined.(306)       jafi            xajã /           jafi           püsiü /        isiom=       jafi
            beautiful       very             beautiful      very           very / all   beautiful
            ‘very beautiful’ (Drabbe 1957:30a)
(307)       Eŋge                    isiom’          jafi           püsiü   oxo.
            ẽ-ge                    isiom=          jafi           püsiü   oxo

            ‘She eats and it is very good.’ (6.225)
Isiom= has a wider distribution than the other intensifiers, and can also be
used to modify a verb (or another adverb).163 In order to catch all these
adverbial uses, I have chosen to consistently gloss it as ‘very/all’.(308)       isiòmu        da-xe-nã
            very/all      come-N1.RLS-N1PL
            ‘they all came’ (Drabbe 1957:29b)
(309)      nu        isiom=          üfü-oxe
           1SG       very/all        hit-N1.RLS[SG]
           ‘he hit me very hard’ (Drabbe 1957:30a)163
      Drabbe writes that isiomu can also be used in combination with adverbs, but does not
give an example.
214                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes(310)   isiom=      tadixa      ke        de
        very/all    big         FOC       COP
        ‘it is very big’ (Drabbe 1957:29b)
(311)   isiom=       kisièmu    küŋ-ge
        very/all     real        die-N1.RLS[SG]
        ‘he really really died’ (Drabbe 1957:30a)
One could also argue that in cases like (308) isiomu is not so much
modifying the verb, but rather the covert subject of the verb. This could be
taken as an argument to analyze the forms in cases like these as indefinite
numerals (modifying the covert subject) rather than as adverbs. In this
context it is relevant to compare (308) above to (312) below. In both cases,
the gloss is a literal translation of the gloss given by Drabbe, where the
gloss in (312) shows that Drabbe sees the form as an indefinite numeral.
This is in line with Drabbe’s earlier section on numerals, where he
describes isiomu as an indefinite numeral, used — like other numerals — in
postnominal position. Although Drabbe may very well be right, I believe
that — given the analogy to (308) — it is still possible to analyze isiomu as
an adverb. This is expressed by the second gloss.(312)    axu       isiom=       da-xe-nã
         human     very/all     come-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘all people came’ (Drabbe 1957:29b) / ‘the people all came’ (my alternative
         interpretation)
We find something of the same ambiguity between an analysis as an adverb
or as indefinite numeral in the two following examples, which are part of
one and the same narrative. As Drabbe does not give a sentence-by
sentence translation in his textual corpus, the translations are more guided
by my own interpretation than in (308) and (312) above. The sentences are
part of a passage where a younger brother is located in a house. His older
brother comes flying to this house, and bumps into it when trying to get in.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                              215
In (313) it is worded how, because of this, his head gets crushed entirely.
Here, the position of isiom= does not allow for an analysis as an indefinite
numeral, as it is not in a postnominal position.","[229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"

For less animate nouns, however, subject inflection is singular also when
reference is made to more than one entity. Consider (195) and (196) below,
with semantically plural subjects and singular inflection on the verb.(195)   dü       pupe            osüke,

The language also has a category of nouns where we find alternation.

situation can be visualized as follows:Humans; larger animals; ?smaller animals; trees; larger objects; smaller objects; mass nouns 122

the respective category is not clear. The use of dashed instead of closed
lines indicates that the borders between the categories are not clear. In
sentence 10 below, for example, we find two nouns that refer to smaller
objects, which nevertheless combine with plural inflection. I would
hypothesize that here plural inflection is used because of the strong
association with animacy; it might even be that here the genitals, as it were,
represent or stand for the persons themselves.","[181, 182]"
"Summary of 2.187 to 2.202. Apupüsimo walks into the water at the tree, but when the
water comes to his armpits, he says to Kiawi that the water is too deep. ""They have
swum across"", Kiawi answers. Apupüsimo, who cannot swim, sinks to the bottom, and
when he comes to the surface again, after having done his best, he calls Kiawi. Kiawi
says: ""change into a crocodile"". After he has asked Kiawi to stay there, Apupüsimo
starts to swim and dives under water (having become a crocodile).",[600]
"Although these conditions do seem to hold in Aghu, I would like to add
another, formal criterion: in the data available to us, the great majority of
semifinite clauses with SS interpretation are followed by a break, indicated
by a comma, a semicolon or a temporal expression like bagidi ‘next day’.249
248
      “Ziehier een ander voorb.: jã bodo kutofidik tümoghe, ghabã tümoghe hij legde (de
verslagene) op een boomtak en sneed af, hij sneed het hoofd af; ghabã tümoghe kan men

249
      We restrict ourselves to sequences of verbs within one and the same sentence. Examples
of semifinites with same subject separated by ba-gidi sit-next.day — which marks the end
of a clause chain — are plenty. The following list forms only a small part: 1.016, 1.017,
1.019, 1.021, 1.023, 1.025 (...) 1.116. Some of the few exceptions to the strong tendency
334                          PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations
If we recall that clause chains are defined as clauses demarcated by pauses,
we must conclude that — within the definition that we use in this book —
these semifinites belong to different clause chains, although they are part of
the same sentence. We can still state, therefore, that sequences of
semifinites within a clause chain imply DS; over clause chains, however,
they may be used in SS conditions. This is only possible, however, if the
conditions (a) and (b) given above are answered. In other words, in order
for a sequence of semifinite verbs within one sentence to be interpreted as
having the same subject, separation by a pause is a necessary, but not a
sufficient condition.250
Sentences (570) through (572), all taken from the text corpus, form a good
illustration of these ‘inter-clause-chain’ but intra-sentential sequences of
semifinites. The relevant verb forms have been printed in bold. First
consider (570). The sequence of memoxenã ‘they continue (placing)’ anddescribed above are the following (these are intra-clause-chain semifinites referring to the
same subject): 2.150, 2.173 (where we find two semifinites separated by dateke. If we take
dateke as a temporal expression analogous to bagidi, however, we might also state that it
introduces a new clause chain, which would make the relation between the two verbs inter-
clause-chainal rather than intra-clause-chainal), last two verbs of 5.16.
250
      This means that the text corpus also contains examples of DS forms within one sentence
separated by a pause. A clear example is found in 5.16, presented here, where we find a
switch of subject between afamoxe and ogüke and again between ogüke and sibumoxe.
Between sibumoxe and kifioxe there is no change of subject:
Xati       woki        fe      to          afamoxe,               sia

daxenã ‘they come’ answers criterion (a): the verbs express sequential
actions that have no temporal overlap. The sequence of daxenã and daxenã
is seen as an instance of condition (b): the second clause forms a
specification of the first. We see something similar in the repetition of the
verb bimoxenã in (571): the second clause specifies that it is the front of the
body that is cut open. The sequence of bimoxenã and afogioxenã in the
same sentence is probably best explained as expressing two events that have
no overlap, although it is also possible to read the second clause as a
specification or explanation of the first.","[351, 352, 353]"
"
Further down in the same text, we find an example of an irrealis semifinite
that refers to an event that the speaker presents as very likely to happen.
The sentence is part of a passage where the two children of the couple
mentioned above come to Apupüsimo’s house to ask where their parents
are. Apupüsimo answers that they have probably gone out to look for sago.
The children wait in Apupüsimo’s house while Apupüsimo goes out to
collect some bananas. Then they hear their parents’ genitals scratch the
inside of a water quiver, and conclude (although this isn’t told explicitly)
that their parents have been killed. When Apupüsimo comes back, he tells
the children:(10)     Oxe:                  gügu    napi             gügu     neto            bagidi

       ‘He says: “your mother and your father will come tomorrow.”’ (2.137)
Semifinites irrealis forms are also used in the protasis of conditional
sentences, as in the following examples. The first has been provided by
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                            47
Drabbe in his grammatical introduction, the second has been taken from the
text corpus.(11)   fiko       afĩ              sumke          edaxe-je

       ‘If (the skirt and the penis gourd) wear down, then Apupüsimo has killed us, (...)’
       (2.074)
A final example of the use of the semifinite irrealis is the following. We
have insufficient data to conclude whether the irrealis here indicates that the
event of pounding sago has not been actualized yet at the moment of
speaking, or whether it is used because the event was not yet realized at the
moment of going.","[64, 65]"

Drabbe remarks that here the 'connective' ke harmonizes with the
preceding noun (Drabbe 1957ː85, note 44). I analyze Apupüsimo efe dü kü
as the complement of the predicate, from which follows that kü is
analyzed as a focus marker, see section 4.4, Table 54.

"
First consider the following examples, which exemplify the use of makeaxe
in a nominal clause. It is important to note that here we do not find the
focus markers te or ke, which are obligatory in analogous sentences with
meoxo, like (266)a-c above. The examples below are sufficient evidence to
show that the particles are not obligatory. Drabbe nowhere states, however,
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                          203
that the markers cannot be used, so we must remain ignorant with regard to
the question whether it is indeed impossible to use them.(275)      makeaxe     de
           what        COP
           ‘what is it?’ (Drabbe 1957:27b)

           ‘They get up and ask “what was that?” ’ (5.29)
Sentences (277) and (278) illustrate the use of makeaxe as arguments in
verbal clauses: either object or subject.(277)      makeaxe     ẽ-ge
           what        eat-N1.RLS[SG]
           ‘what did he eat’ (Drabbe 1957:27b)(278)      makeaxe     de          i-ge

           ‘what is lying there?’ (Drabbe 1957:27b)
The combination of makeaxe and postpositional case marker ni is used in
the sense of ‘what for’ or ‘why’, as can be seen in (279) through (281):(279)      makeaxe     ni            de
           what        DAT           COP
           ‘what is it meant for’ (Drabbe 1957:27b)
157
      It is not unthinkable that de should be analyzed as a copula or emphasis marker here, so
that the sentence should be read as ‘what is it - it lies?’. Cf. section 3.11, esp. example
(437) napi de baxe ‘mother is sitting there’, where I argue that locative de may have
developed out of the copula marker de or emphatic *de.

Unlike meoxo ‘who’, makeaxe can also be used adnominally in the sense of

          ‘What kind of house do you live in?’ (Drabbe 1957:27b)
To close with, a remarkable use of makeaxe attested in the text corpus is
the following:(283)     Oxe,                  joxo     neto             posiü     oxe:

Drabbe 1957: section 67, p. 27-28
158
      Note that adnominal makeaxe is not translated by Drabbe as ‘which’. For this, the
language uses makumã or mamã, for which the reader is referred to the following section,
examples (290) through (293).
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                          205
Two other interrogative forms discussed by Drabbe are makumu, and
makumã, which according to Drabbe mean ‘how, how many, where, when’.
To generalize over all these contextual inferences, I will use the gloss
‘how/where/when’. To these two forms Drabbe adds a third one, mamã,
which is another form that can be used to inform after someone’s place of
living.159 Finally, we find the form maketa ‘what’, to which we will come
back at the end of this section. Drabbe analyzes the form makumu as an
adverb, in line with the adverbs in mu discussed in 3.4.2, and makumã as a
verbal noun. Following Drabbe at this point we would expect makumã to
exhibit more nominal properties than makumu. We will see that this is
indeed seems to be the case. Unlike makumu, both makumã and mamã may
be marked for accusative case (see (287)), are used as part of a possessive
construction (see (288) and (289)), and as a copula complement ((297)a, b).
All the interrogative forms can be used either independently, or —
analogous to makeaxe above — adnominally.","[220, 221, 222, 223]"

5.5.1 Simple conditional sentences
Drabbe 1957:23aSimple, positive conditional sentences consist of an imperative or semifinite
irrealis clause that forms the protasis, and a future clause that forms the
apodosis. (575) through (577) are examples with a semifinite protasis, while
(578) exemplifies the use of an imperative. Note that (578) differs only
minimally from (577).(575)   ba-gidi             a         aw=            akī

Negative conditional sentences are formed by the use of a negated verbal
noun which is predicated by the use of ki(k) ‘become’. This was illustrated
in (52) and (53) above (section 2.3.2.2.9 on verbal nouns in negative
sentences), and is repeated here as (579) and (580), respectively:(579)   ba-gidi                a       aw=akin=de                       kĩ

5.5.2 Counterfactual conditional sentences
Drabbe (1957): section 58, p. 23Counterfactual conditional sentences are marked by a marker fini + copula
oxo in the final position of the protasis. Although Drabbe refers to fini as
an irrealis marker, I will gloss it as CFT ‘counterfactual’, to avoid the
suggestion that fini would combine with irrealis verbs; in fact, in all cases
fini combines with realis verbs. There is a certain ‘logic’ to the use of a
realis, in that fini combines with verbs that refer to events that could in
principle have been actualized — this is expressed by the use of realis in
the verbal clause — but in fact have not — this is expressed by the use of
the counterfactual marker plus copula oxo. The structure of the protasis is
analogous to the structure of negative clauses and interrogative clauses
(discussed in 2.6, 2.7 and especially 4.6), as is clear from a comparison of
the following clauses, where NgCFT stands for negative counterfactual.","[355, 356, 357]"
"
It should be noted that in both of the examples of the use of bu ‘DUR’ in the
text corpus we have to do with a situation that is presented as being
perceived: either audible (in (93)), or visible (in (98)).69 In that respect it is
relevant to pay attention to what Drabbe remarks at the end of his section
on duratives. He points out that most of the time duratives (in i- or formed
with bu) combine with demonstrative pronouns. 70 In my opinion, these69
     This is also true in most of the examples from the text corpus. Clear examples of events
presented as perceived are found in 1.071, 1.306, 2.049 and 2.053/54, 3.054, 3.057,
3.072/73, 3.076, 3.085, 6.055, 6.063, 6.077, 6.122, 6.161, 8.018. The other examples of the
use of bu can also be taken as such: 2.004, 2.022, 2.029, 2.036, 2.052, 2.054, 2.059, 2.118,
2.169, 2.201/2, 2.207, 2.208, 6.053, 6.195 and 8.001.
70
     This tendency, however, is not confirmed by the data in the text corpus.

demonstratives — which will be dealt with in more detail in 3.2.4 —
contribute to the visualization of the event, or — more broadly — present it
as being perceived: either visually, or audibly, or possibly also by other
sensory means. The combination of durative aspect and the use of
demonstratives — deictic by definition — places the event in the ‘here and
now’ of either the addressee (as in the examples that follow), or of the
participant that perceives the event (as in (98) above). Drabbe gives the
following examples:(99)    fiko    xo        b=          afī-ke

         ‘we are clearing the garden’ (Drabbe 1957:22a)2.4.3.3 Durative aspect expressed by constructions with posture
        verbs
Drabbe 1957: section 84, p. 34-35; section 87, p. 35In addition to the morphological and lexical means discussed in the two
previous sections, durative aspect can also be expressed analytically, which
in fact is the most common way to express durativity (Drabbe 1957:40b).
98                                            PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs
The analytic construction71 is formed by a nonfinite realis form in –dV(=k)
followed by a (semi)finite realis form or a –ke final durative form of one of
the posture verbs ba(x) ‘sit’, e(k) ‘stand’, or i(g) ‘lie down’.72 Consider the
following example, where we find the nonfinite realis form adek followed
by a semifinite realis form of the verb e ‘stand’. It should be noted that in
the durative construction under discussion, the posture verbs still have a
lexical semantic content, in that the posture of the subject is still part of the
meaning. Thus, the construction with e ‘stand’ in (103) not only implies a
durative meaning, but also implies that the subject is in standing posture. In
this book, this has been made clear by adding this meaning aspect in
brackets.(103)      fiko     a-de=k             e-ke
           work     take-SS=CON        stand-N1.RLS[SG]
           ‘he is / was (standing and) working’ (Drabbe 1957:34a)
As mentioned, it is also possible to use a finite form of the posture verb. In
(104) we find a historical past, while (105) forms the distant past71
     Here, the term ‘construction’ should in the first place be taken in a rather loose sense, as
indicating a certain constellation of verbs. Whereas in stricter definitions of the term
‘construction’ the term entails that its properties are more than the sum of the properties of
its parts, this is not necessarily the case here. In fact, I will argue below that the durative
reading can very well be seen as a contextual implication, and not as a necessary part of
the meaning of the construction. On the other hand, as we will see below, it is specifically
within the framework of this construction that the so-called distant past and historical past
have a wider range of possible interpretations. In other words: while the durative reading
may be seen as a contextual implication, and cannot be taken as an argument that we have
to do with a construction in the strict sense of the word, the range of interpretations
imposed on distant past and historical past forms seems specific to this construction, does
not seem to follow from the sum of its parts, and can be seen as an argument for
considering this as a construction in the stricter sense of the word.
72
     Drabbe does not explicitly restrict the construction to realis (semi)finite positional verbs.
As he does not say anything about irrealis positional verbs in this construction, it is safest
to remain ignorant at this point, and to leave this out of the discussion.

counterpart of (103) above. Interestingly, the use of the distant past in this
construction is extended in that “[the forms] are indifferent with respect to
a more distant or a more recent past, and can even be used as present; only
from the context can one conclude which tense is intended” (Drabbe
1957:34). 73(104)      bigio        si-di=k                 ba-dia

         go-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘After they have been (walking and) searching (for a while), they come home, and
         the following day they come down (out of their house) again and go out.’ (1.027,
         028)
The use of the durative construction at the beginning of (107) (fomenek
ēkena) stresses that the searching is a process: going on for a while, and not
a punctual event. Similar to what we saw in (85) above, the event does not
overlap temporally with the event expressed by the following verb: daxenã;
first they search for food and only after they have searched for food, they
come home. This means that the durative aspect expressed by this
construction primarily has to do with the internal structure of the event, and
does not relate to the (temporal) relation between this event and events
expressed by following verbs. This is even clearer from the fact that we
also find the durative construction combined with the use of –ku SS.SEQ.74
This marker, further discussed in 5.4.2.1, expresses — in addition to
identity in subject — that the following event is sequential to the present
one:74
     In the durative construction, we find the suffix -ku used in combination with ba, i, and e,
as well as with their continuous counterparts bame-, imi, meme- (see section 2.8.3.4).
Consider the following example, which differs from (108) below in the use of (1PL rather
than 1SG and) a continuative stem rather that a ‘normal’ stem of type I.
           bigio       si-di=k             bamoaŋ=gu            ax-oa-ne

           ‘We will first be busy twining the matrass for a while and then go’ (Drabbe 1957:37a,b)
The suffix does not seem to be used, however, in combination with the continuatve_II
forms bambax, mebax, and ibax. At least, this is what I conclude from the fact that Drabbe
does not mention this possibility, and from the fact that he only gives examples of
continuative_II forms without =ku.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                     101(108)     bigio        si-di=k             boxo=ku              axi-je
          mattress     twine-SS=CON        sit_II[1SG]-SS.SEQ   go_II[1SG]-FUT
          ‘I will first twine the mattress and then go’ (Drabbe 1957:37a)
The passage cited in (106) - (107) above also nicely illustrates the extended
use of the distant past; the form is used in the middle of a story which, as a
whole, has been placed in the historical past (which becomes clear only in
the last sentence of the narrative). This is incompatible with a reading in
which the distant past form ēkenã is understood as referring to a past ‘not
too long before yesterday’ (cf. 2.3.3.1).75
As stated above, the posture verb can also be a durative verb in -ke. This is
the case in (109) and (110) below, which differ only minimally from (104)
and (105) above.(109)     bigio        si-di=k            bo-ke
          mattress     twine-SS=CON       sit_II-DUR[1SG]
          ‘I am / was (sitting and) twining a mattress’ (Drabbe 1957:34a)
(110)     fiko       a-de=k           iā-ke
          work       take-SS=CON      stand_II-DUR[1SG]
          ‘I am / was (standing and) working’ (Drabbe 1957:34a)
Finally, consider (111) below. Although the sequence of verbs here would
formally count as a ‘durative construction’, the context makes a durative
reading impossible. The sentence is not about a durative going up, but
about a going up and a subsequent sitting down. In my view, this example
shows that the durative construction that has been described in this section
is not a fully grammaticalized construction. The durative reading has not
75
     Although the story has been placed in the historical past, like Drabbe I have chosen to
translate with present tense. With this, I have wanted to express that the story, as it
unfolds, can be seen as neutral between a ‘normal present’ reading and a historical present
reading, cf. the introduction to the text corpus.
102                                        PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs
fully become part of the construction, but should rather be seen as a strong
contextual implication. If we find a nonfinite V1, followed by a verb of
posture V2, there is a strong implication of (1) overlap between V1 and V2,
and (2) a durative reading of (V1+V2). Examples like (111) below,
however, show that the question whether this reading really holds, is still
dependent on the context.","[114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"

be seen as the negative counterpart of the expressions with positive

A final example is the following, where we do not find a spatial noun.

wounded (cf. 1.158, 1.211, 1.217 etc.), here it is only one body part that is

In the text corpus, kumu ‘ACC’ is attested only three times, in 3.184, 6.078

shooting of an arm), in the other two cases kumu can be said to modify a
spatial noun. One of these cases is presented here:(397)       Emu       to             kumu        pemoxo

     Note that we have to do here with modality, more than with mood, which can be seen as
grammaticalized modality that is morphologically expressed, cf. footnote 83 above. In
Aghu, the core system of oppositions in mood is formed by a system of morphological
oppositions between three types of stems: stems of type I, stems of type II and imperative
stems. Here we have to do with other ways of — less grammaticalized — expressing
oppositions in modality.

Considering the form of the negated semifinite forms, it is not hard to see
that here we have to do with a formative ku and a formative oxo, where the
latter can be functionally and formally equated to the predicator (o)xo that
is also used in the other negative constructions. The formative ku, which
given the analogy to the negator de in the other forms is synchronically
analyzed as a negator, can probably be historically related to the emphatic
marker ku ‘EMP’ that we find in emphatic pronouns, cf. section 3.2.1. This
would make the development of ku analogous to what Wester describes for
the negator de (Wester 2014: 131-32). Citing Croft (1991:5) on the sources
of verbal negators, she convincingly argues that the negator de that is found
in several Awyu languages has an emphatic marker de as its source (which88
     It is noteworthy that the verb forms in this column could, formally, also be analyzed as
semifinite forms, with assimilation of the final autonomous nasal (in all forms except 1SG)
to the following alveolar. Drabbe, however, analyzes the forms as finite forms in which the
final e of the future marker is elided. I will follow Drabbe at this point for two reasons.
First, analyzing the forms in =kuoxo as semifinites and those in the first column as finites
makes sense from a paradigmatic point of view, and is in line with the function of the two
forms. Both in positive sentences and in negative sentences we then have finite and
semifinite forms, with the finite forms associated (primarily) with indicative-declarative
mood, and the semifinites with other types of mood — see Table 27 above. Second, we
find an analogous elision of final future e in the interrogative forms discussed in 2.7
(which are forms that cannot be analyzed as semifinite forms, see the discussion there).
The forms should, therefore, be analyzed as ade-Ø=dè xo [hear_II[1SG]-FUT=NEG COP] ‘I
will not hear’etc.

has survived in Aghu as an emphatic marker de with copular function, as
well as in the optional negator fede.)
Drabbe describes the negated semifinite forms as ‘negative optatives’ and
gives the following examples. Unfortunately, no additional examples were
attested.(136)   nu       atosunu             aküme=ku            òxo
        1SG      take.care.IMP[SG]   die_II[1SG]=NEG     COP

        ‘do not let the children go home’ (Drabbe 1957:14b)
Drabbe gives only few illustrations of negated finite future forms. With the
following example he illustrates that negated future forms are also used for
expressing “a not being allowed”:(138)   siü        fed’              axij-e              xo
        1SG        NEG               die_II[1SG]=NEG     COP
        ‘I am not allowed to eat bananas’ (Drabbe 1957:17b)
He uses the examples below to illustrate that instead of the future forms
“one likes to use, if this matches the meaning of the sentence”, a negative
verbal noun plus mũ ‘not want’, so that (139) and (140) can be used in the
same situation:(139)   axi=de              xo

        eat_II-VN=NEG      not.want-N1.RLS-N1PL

        ‘I do not want to obey him’ (lit. ‘I do not want to listen to his voice’;
        Drabbe 1957:16b)
Note that the examples above contain a negative marker de, in spite of the
fact that the verb mũ has a negative meaning in itself (cf. 2.3.2.2.10).
Instead of a verbal noun, one may also use a negative future form. Thus,
(143) below has the same meaning as (141) above:(143)   adi-nan- Ø=-de             muŋ-ge-nã
        eat_II-N1PL-FUT=NEG        not.want-N1.RLS-N1PL
        ‘they do not want to eat’ (Drabbe 1957:16b)

Papuan languages to have personal or possessive pronouns that are tightly interwoven with
kinship terms was already noted by Drabbe (1950:101), and gives an anthropological
explanation: “in Awyu-Dumut languages, kinship terms express a dyadic relationship.
They do not refer to one person, as such, but to the relationship in which that person stands
to the speaker or another person (Stasch 2009:72). Awyu-Dumut kinship terms are not
inherently possessed, but it is rare for a kinship term to occur without the ‘possessor’ of
that particular kin being named” (Wester 2014: 56-57).
120
      From Drabbe’s description it is not clear whether contracted forms exist for all kinship
nouns, or only for a subset.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                               159
Examples of this dyadic construction are given in (186) through (188)
below:(186)       efe       n-eto             efe         n-amoko
            3SG       LNK-father        3SG         LNK-son
            ‘father and son’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)

            3SG       LNK-husband             3SG        LNK-wife
            ‘husband and wife’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 4.003)

            ‘younger and elder brother’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 3.001)
It is important to note that the dyadic construction can be used for dyadic
relations only, not for reference to pairs in a non-dyadic relation. In that
respect, it can be contrasted to the use of ko, as in (189) below, where the
phrase can refer either to a married couple (dyadic) or to a non-married
‘man and woman’:(189)       ãŋ           go        ku
            woman        and       man
            ‘man and woman’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)3.1.5 Number
Drabbe 1957: section 9, p. 5a-b; section 14, p. 7b-8aThe famous linguistic scholar Roman Jakobson once stated that ‘languages
differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may
convey’ (Jakobson 1959). Every linguistic system, in other words, has
grammaticalized other aspects of reality, and every linguistic system should,
therefore, be described in its own terms. In this section, I would like to
160                        PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
make clear that Aghu differs with respect to a language like English in what
it must say about number. This is also true for definiteness, which will be
the topic of 3.1.6 below. speakers of English must specify each Noun
Phrase for number and definiteness: Noun Phrases are either singular or
plural, and either definite or indefinite. This is not true for speakers of
Aghu. Noun Phrases are generally not specified for number, and there is no
requirement in Aghu grammar to specify Noun Phrases for definiteness. In
the words of Drabbe:“axu k’etede [human ACC see-1.RLS[SG] may mean: ‘I saw the man, a man, the men,
men.””121
Thus, while Aghu differs from English in what it must convey, speakers of
Aghu may choose to specify nouns for the categories expressed by number
and definiteness: they may choose to express whether a Noun Phrase refers
to single or multiple entities, and may choose to specify whether Noun
Phrases refer to entities known to the addressee or not. In the remainder of
this section we will consider number, while we will have a look at the
category of definiteness in section 3.1.6 below.","[176, 177, 178]"

Drabbe discusses various ways in which pronouns can be modified, many
of which, however, are not attested in the text corpus.137 What needs to be136
      According to Drabbe, the basic form of the 3SG pronoun is efe, while eke is analyzed as
a contracted form of efe + ke. Wester (2014:71) gives both efe and eke as Aghu 3SG
pronouns, and derives the latter form from pA *eke. She also writes that the form efe (or
ewe in Shiaxa and Yenimu) “could well have originated in an Awyu-Dumut deictic
element ep or e ‘there’.” Irrespective of the question whether these reconstructions are
correct, it is clear that efe and eke synchronically have different functions. More on this
can be found in 3.2.3.2.
137
      Drabbe (1957:7a) mentions the following. (1) ku ‘EMP’ (discussed in the text above) can
be followed by gedeme, which further emphasizes the concept of ‘self’: nu ku gedeme
‘1SG-EMP EMP’. (2) Emphatic pronouns can also be followed by a pronoun of same person
plus namu, which has the same meaning as the construction with gedeme: nu-ku nu-namu
‘1SG-EMP 1SG-EMP’. (3) Instead of emphatic oku following the pronoun, speakers may also
use okagi or okagimu. (4) Drabbe points to the use of emphatic pronouns in certain
nominal clauses: ok’ iman e-ke [3SG.EMP EMP stand-N1.RLS[SG]] or ok’ iman ba-xe [EMP
EMP sit-N1.RLS[SG]] ‘that’s how he is’. In these examples, the posture verbs e ‘stand’ and
178                          PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
mentioned here, however, is the use of the emphatic suffix -ku ‘EMP’, which
may follow the 1SG, 2SG or 3PL pronouns. In 3SG the form oku is used,
which Drabbe tentatively analyzes as a contracted form of efe and ku.138
The forms of 1SG and 2SG plus -ku are also used for reference to plural
speakers and addressees, so that we get the following paradigm:Table 42: Emphatic pronouns
          SG        PL
1         nuku
2         guku
3         oku       joxokuThe emphatic pronouns from Table 42 alternate with oku followed by the
independent pronouns of Table 41. In other words, oku nu ‘EMP 1SG’ has
the same distribution and meaning as nu-ku ‘1SG-EMP’; oku gu ‘EMP 2SG’ is
identical in meaning and distribution to gu-ku ‘2SG-EMP’, and ok’ eke
alternates with oku. The form oku therefore seems to show traces of a
diachronic development from ‘3SG-EMP’ to a grammatical formative
unspecified for person, to be glossed as ‘EMP’.139 In this book, the form is
glossed either as 3SG-EMP or as EMP, dependent on its position.ba ‘sit’ function as a copulas, cf. 2.8.2. (5) In possessive phrases we find nu namu na büsiü
[1SG only 1SG.POS house ] ‘my own house, a house belonging to me only’; eke namu efe
büsiü [3SG.FOC only 3SG house ] ‘his own house’, or oku ga büsiü ke de [EMP 2SG.POS
house FOC COP ] ‘it is your own house’.
138
      I have used the term ‘tentatively’ here to make clear that Drabbe notes the ambiguity
between 3SG reading of oku, and one in which it is used to strengthen other than 3 rd person
pronouns; see the discussion below.
139
      Alternatively, one might hypothesize that * oku is the basic form, which, in a position
after pronouns — which are all vowel-final — developed into a suffix -ku. In third person
singular, the form oku might either be suppletive for the 3SG pronoun + oku, or be the
result of a contraction between *oku and a 3SG proto pronoun (which has now become
lost).

In combination with the word nikiaxamu ‘back’, the emphatic pronoun gets
a reflexive reading, as in the following example:(223)     oku            nikiaxamu   mü ̃           kõ       ku-nu-k      küŋ-ge

          ‘I wounded myself while chopping’ (Drabbe 1957:7a)3.2.2 Possessive pronouns: form
Drabbe 1957: section 13, p. 7a/bThe language has dedicated possessive pronouns for 1SG and 2SG only: na
and ga, respectively. In all other cases, the ‘normal’ independent pronouns
of Table 41 above are used. Possessive constructions formed with pronouns
are parallel in structure to the possessive constructions described in Figure
10 above: possessive pronouns directly precede the nouns they modify. This
is indicated in Figure 14:(possessive) pronoun                     N2

180                      PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
Here too vowel-initial nouns combine with a possessive linker n=.
Interestingly, it is only before these vowel-initial nouns that the possessive
pronouns na and ga alternate with the free pronouns nu and gu.(225a)   na            n-amu                        / (b)    nu          n-amu

         ‘my meat’ (Drabbe 1957:7a)                          ‘my meat’ (Drabbe 1957:7a)
(226a)   ga         n-eto                           / (b)    gu                     n-eto

         ‘your father’ (Drabbe 1957:7b)                      ‘your father’ (Drabbe 1957:7b)
With consonant-initial nouns, however, only the possessive pronouns can be
used, so that (227a) is ungrammatical:(227a)   na                      xasi     /   (b)      *nu        xasi

Nouns referring to kinship may, in 1SG and 2SG, take possessive prefixes.

As argued in Wester (2014:103-4), in Awyu languages semifinite verb
forms contain reflexes of proto-Awyu realis markers *-d and *-k, used for
verbs with a speaker-subject (first person), and for verbs with someone else
than the speaker as their subject (nonfirst person), respectively. In Aghu,
these reflexes can be discerned in the form of the realis suffix of the first
and nonfirst persons: the first person singular -de and first person plural -
doã reflect *-d, while the nonfirst person suffixes -ke and -kena reflect *-

     In the tensed forms of distant and historical past, the realis marker d is used in all
persons; see Table 9 in section 2.3.3 below.

     The e in 1st person singular de is probably a reflex of proto-Awyu *-e(fe) ‘1SG’, while e
in nonfirst person can be traced back to proto-Awyu *-en ‘N1SG’ (reconstructions from
Wester 2014:85). Synchronically, however, I have analyzed -de and -ke as portmanteau
38                                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: VerbsThe form of the realis nonfirst marker is -ke, -ge, -xe, or -oxe, and is
dependent on the verb. Each verb stem, in other words, combines with only
one of these allomorphs, and which allomorph is chosen is part of the
lexical entry of the verb. That the choice of the allomorph is not (fully)
phonologically conditioned is clear from the existence of minimal pairs:
verbs that differ only in the form of the realis marker with which they
combine. Some examples are given in Table 6 below.
morphemes of person and mood, which are singular forms due to the opposition with the
plural suffixes d-oã and ke-nã (-de and -d are considered allomorphs). A strong argument
in favor of the analysis of the first person singular as unmarked compared to a marked
plural form can be found by analogy to the paradigms of the historical past forms, as well
as to the irrealis paradigm. In the irrealis we have singular afi ‘take_II[SG]’ and plural afi-
oã ‘take_II-1PL’, while historical past singular da-dia ‘come-HST[SG]’ can be contrasted
with plural da-dia-oã ‘come-HST-1PL’. The allomorphy -d~de finds a parallel in the distant
past, which has an e-final allomorph -dke used in singular (e.g. in da-dke ‘come-
DIST.1[SG]’) and a C-final allomorph -dk used in the plural (e.g. in da-dk-oã ‘come-DIST.1-
1PL’). The first person plural suffix -oã goes back to proto-Awyu *-fan, which can
ultimately be traced back to proto-Awyu-Dumut *-ep ‘1st person’ + *-an ‘plural’. The
nonfirst plural suffix can be traced back to proto-Awyu *-enan.

Verb           N1 realis      Example
               marker
da ‘come’      -xe            da-xe-nã [come-N1.RLS-N1PL] ‘they come’ (1.005)
da ‘hear’      -ke            da-ke-nã [hear-N1.RLS-N1PL] ‘they hear’ (8.018)
i ‘sing’       -ke            i-ke-nã [sing-N1.RLS-N1PL] ‘they sing’ (1.173)
i ‘lie’        -ge            i-ge-nã [lie-N1.RLS-N1PL] ‘they lie down’ (1.030)
ü ‘stab’       -ge            ü-ge [stab-N1.RLS[SG]] ‘he stabs (a person)’ (1.138)
ü ‘cut’        -ke            waxajo ü-ke-nã [sago.leaf cut-N1.RLS-N1PL] ‘they cut
                              sago leaves’ (1.160)
Stems ending in a nasal vowel invariably combine with the allomorph -ge,
while the autonomous nasal segment is realized as a velar nasal consonant
(cf. section 1.1.1.1 on nasal vowels). Thus we get xafüŋ-ge [break-
N1.RLS[SG]] ‘he breaks’ as a N1 semifinite (singular) realis form of xafü ̃
‘break’, or sikuŋ-ge-nã [place-N1.RLS-N1PL] ‘they place’ as a N1 semifinite
(plural) realis form of sikũ ‘place’. Another category with a fully
predictable ending is formed by the category of stems -mV ‘do’. These
stems invariably combine with -oxe, with elision of the final vowel of the
stem. Thus, atetame ‘split.IT’, when combined with the N1.RLS suffix,
results in atetam-oxe-nã [split.IT-N1.RLS-N1PL] ‘they split’ (1.009), while
efegem-oxe [cut-N1.RLS[SG]] ‘she cuts’ (1.011) is an example of a
semifinite formed with mV-derived efegeme ‘cut’. While the final vowel of
-mV final verbs usually harmonizes with the final vowel of the root, Drabbe
notes that it may also harmonize with the vowel of the suffix. As the only
illustrations he gives fime-de as an alternative for fimi-de and fimo-d-oã as
an alternative for fimi-d-oã, and he points out that we find “the same” for
the distant past and historical past forms.","[55, 56, 57]"
"
It is not possible to negate an imperative form. Instead, Aghu speakers use
an imperative form of mũ ‘not want’ with a verbal noun as complement.
Some of the examples given by Drabbe are presented here (mafi-oxone is a
shorter variant of manefi-oxone):(129)   dugu          simã          manefi
        roof          twine_II.VN   not.want.IMP[SG]
        ‘don’t twine a roof’ (Drabbe 1957: 16b)
(130)   tamã          mafi-oxone
        write_II.VN   not.want.IMP-PL
        ‘don’t write’ (Drabbe 1957:16b)
Instead of a verbal noun, the imperative may also combine with a future, as
in (131) below(131)   afi-n-e               manefi
        take_II-N1SG-FUT      not.want.IMP[SG]
        ‘don’t take’ (Drabbe 1957:17b)
Drabbe remarks that the future suffix -e bears no stress, and therefore is
often elided (‘cannot be heard’). We find an example of this in one of the
texts, presented here as (132). Note, by the way, how the verb manefi takes
the entire series of preceding verbs as it complement.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                          117(132)      osubu          küobu         ku              adin’ 86               manefi

           ‘don't go up and carve and eat the youngest shoot of the stem’ (3.050)
Although not mentioned explicitly by Drabbe, (133) below shows that mũ
can combine not only with finite, but also with semifinite irrealis verbs (the
future — finite by definition — would be oxenan(e) instead of oxenã.)(133)      em’           ob’         oxenã                   mafioxone
           em=           o-bu        o-xe-nã                 mafi-oxone
           then          speak-SS    speak-N1.RLS-N1PL       not.want.IMP-PL
           ‘then don’t speak about it’ (5.28)2.6 Negation
Drabbe 1957: section 16, p. 8-9; section 29, p. 14; sections 42-44, p. 16-17In 2.3.2.2 (example (48), repeated here as (134)), it was shown how verbal
nouns are used in the negation of past and present events:(134)     joxo      de         baxe-n=de          xo
          3PL       LOC        sit_II-VN=NEG      COP
          ‘they are not here’ (Drabbe 1957:16a)
An alternative way of negating past and present events is by the use of
semifinite or finite realis forms, again followed by de xo NEG COP, with
final stress of the verb shifting to the negator de. The verbs are optionally
preceded by fede. Consider the following example.(135)      (fede) da-de=dè                  xo
           (NEG) come-1SG.RLS=NEG            COP
86
     Note that the form adin(e) differs from the verbal noun adĩ and from the (homophonous)
semifinite irrealis N1SG form adĩ.
118                                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs        ‘I didn’t come’ (Drabbe: 1957:17)
In cases like this, one could state that the entire clause is predicated over
and negated. We have a complete verbal clause dade ‘I come’, which is
embedded in a negative clause. The syntactic and semantic structure of this
clause (not considering fede) could be rendered as follows:Syntactic structure       [[dade]VERBAL CLAUSE =dè   xo ]NEGATIVE CLAUSE
Semantic structure        [[I come]          it is not] -> ‘It is not (the case that): I
                                                                 come’
Figure 7: verbal clause embedded in a negative clause
It should be noted that the negator is syntactically independent of the verb.
Therefore this book deviates from Drabbe, in rendering the formative =de
as a clitic instead of a suffix. The form of verb +clitic is fully regular, with
autonomous nasals rendered as n before =de, as in (semifinite realis:) da-d-
oan=dè [come-1.RLS-1PL=NEG] ‘we come’, so that we get the following
paradigms:Table 25: Negation of realis verbs

Turning to verbal clauses headed by irrealis verbs, we see that the same
construction is used for the negation of a future event, but then with a
verbal clause headed by a finite future verb. Thus, we get the following
paradigm, again with autonomous nasals rendered as n before =de. The
future marker e has been elided, more on which can be found in note 88 at
Table 28 below.","[134, 135, 136, 137]"
