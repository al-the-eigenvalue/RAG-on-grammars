"          Back to the negation of pieces of information, what about when the piece beingnegated involves an adverb or a verb? In the case of an adverb, the negative word used ishahak, which means ‘no’ and which can be the answer to a yes/no question (example 71).",[274]
"Basically, these clauses are the usual way of answering a yes/no question about a habitualevent.",[226]
"        This is the overall scenario with regard to simple declarative clauses. Now, let ussee how clauses are configured in other kinds of modalities.
                                                                                             2306.2. Interrogative clauses        This section will be dedicated to the study of interrogative clauses in Trumai andhow they are organized. The interrogative clauses can be divided into two major types: (1)polar questions, which request a yes-no answer, and (ii) information questions, which canrequest information about a participant in an event (who; what), about a location (where),a specific time (when), a reason (why), and so on.","[257, 258]"
"         A question is then raised: is the ke observed in clauses where the Absolutive NP isfar from the verb the same ke as found in nominalizations? Is it the same ke as found incleft clauses? We would like to say yes to this question, in order to have a unified accountfor all these three cases, since in all of them the form in question is the same, ke.",[207]

Again, clauses with verbs showthe syntax of nominal predicates, but the Negation particle used is the one that typicallymodifies verbs, tak. '9 For instance:Negative answer to question - first person:

19 This is observed with Transitive verbs too:

           ‘I did not call you.’
20 In affirmative answers, the order [V ke ka_in S Cop (DAT)] or [V ke ka_in A O Cop (DAT)] is used
when the verb refers to an habitual event (e.g. I work). In negative answers, this order occurs for non-
habitual events (e.g. I am not working, I did not work). When the negative answer refers to a habitual event
(e.g. I do not work), the morpheme t(a)ke ‘Privative’ is used (cf. chapter 4, section 4.3).
                                                                                             199        Pred       Neg         Cop-s

        (same as example (65-b)        Looking at these two last examples, we can see that the morpheme ke is notpresent in the clauses. When the Negation particle tak is used, the presence of themorpheme ke is not obligatory (so far, we have not identified a difference in meaning):
Additional examples:

          ‘He does not have long arms.’        Then a question arises: can the order between ke and tak be reversed, in order tonegate not only the verb, but the whole predicate? The answer is no. The negator tak isused if we negate the verb itself, that is, if we want to negate the nucleus of the predicate.","[223, 224, 225]"
"         A problem regarding the pronominal set in Trumai involves two forms observedin the corpus that seem to be also pronominal: in and ni. These two forms can be foundbehaving as pronouns, that is, acting as the head of an NP and receiving nominalmorphology:(44)     in yi-ki                   ‘at it (it = the event of a woman going to work)’
         it   yYI-Dat
(45)     in-is                      ‘at it (it = the event of a friend making a question)’
         it-Dat(46)     in lots’                   ‘from it (it= the event of some men making houses)’
         it Allat(47)   — ni-ki                      ‘in this.one (one= place, the village), here’
         this.one-Dat
(48)     ni   lots’                 ‘from this.one (one=place, the village), from here’
         this Allat
         However, there are no examples of in referring to a physical object rather than toan event. Perhaps this is just a matter of a gap in the corpus. More complicated is the caseof ni, which sometimes behaves as an adverb:(49)     ni-a           hi chi?
         here-Quest 2 Cop
         “Are you here?”®8 Observe that the adverbs nina ‘here’ and ina ‘there’ do not receive case marking:
                                                                                                32
(50)   ni!
       here
       ‘Here!’ (answer to the question: Where is the coffee?)
        Could we say that ni is a pronoun that sometimes can behave as an adverb? Or isthe adverbial occurrence of ni actually a reduction of the adverb nina ‘here’? At themoment, there are no definitive answers for these questions. The only thing we could sayis that it would be possible to align in and ni with the attested Trumai pronouns:       Masc_      Fem        Neuter
        ine       inatl      in                 ‘he - she -it’
        ni'de_    ni’datl    ni                 ‘this.one (M) - this.one (F) - this.one (N)’
        However, there are further questions: (1) it is necessary to check if both in and nican be pluralized. This capacity would make more clear their pronominal status; (2) thereis no neutral form for ‘that one’. In one text, the form inde was found, but it seems to bean adverb rather than a demonstrative pronoun (i.e. ‘there (not so far from speaker orlistener)’ rather than ‘that one’). This third form needs to be investigated further, and theother ones - in and ni - need extra checking, with special attention to the interplaybetween ni and nina.","[57, 58]"
"       Examples (50-55) seem to be what Heine and Reh (1984) call completive focus:“This type of pragmatic function does not involve contrast, the focus information ismeant rather to fill a gap in the pragmatic knowledge of the addressee. Most clearly,completive focus manifests itself in answers to WH-questions. It may refer to eitherarguments (term focus), or predicates (predicate focus), possibly also entire clauses.”",[206]
"       These questions are not easy to answer. A linguist may address them in differentways, depending on his/her theoretical perspective, and different answers have differentconsequences. Depending on how the second question is answered, the analysis of amorpheme/construction can change a lot.
                                                                                              XXHl
        In this dissertation, the formal aspects of Trumai are taken into account, but thesemantic and pragmatic aspects also have a very importance place. I am presenting herethe analyses that seem more adequate for the facts observed in the data. In some cases,when the scenario observed in the Trumai examples is too complex and more than oneaccount is possible, I prefer to present all the possible competing analyses withoutdeciding in favor of any of them. It seems to me that it is better to leave some point opento discussion than to decide on an analysis that is not clearly the best. In the future, asfurther research brings new information about these points, I will revisit these points.","[25, 26]"

6.2.1. Polar questions
        Polar questions require the use of the enclitic a, which occurs after the element(the constituent) under interrogation:(1)     [hi fa-tke]- a    hai-tl ?
         2 kill-Des-Quest 1-Dat
        ‘Do you want to kill me?’(2)     [hiwan    xot’ken]-a
         2 PL    dig-Quest
        ‘Are you (PL) digging?’(3)     [ni] a       de        hi chi ?
        here Quest already 2 Cop
        ‘Are you already here?’(4)     [wanyi sone-n]-a ?
         PL YI drink-3Abs-Quest
        ‘Are they drinking?’
        It is also possible to express interrogation without the use of a. A change in theintonational contour of the clause can indicate that the clause is a question.
                                                                                            231This is the case for questions used when the speaker wants confirmation about something(the declarative clause has a descending contour at its end, while the question has anascending contour):
                   _>,
        ho’kela. hi ma.
                                                       .
                                ‘Ok. You eat (some kind of food).’        —_
        hi ma?                  ‘Are you going to eat (the food that is being prepared)?’
        However, this kind of interrogation with only change in the intonation has limiteduse, because sometimes it can cause ambiguity (it may be not clear to the listener if theclause is a statement or a question). The use of the enclitic a is preferred and is quitefrequent in the data.","[258, 259]"
"       We also have in this section a discussion with regard to scope, based on the ideasof Givon (1984). As he explains, sometimes the scope of negation can be narrowed down,with only one constituent being negated (the verb, a NP, etc.). By narrowing the scope, aspeaker can make the grounds of denial more precise. When scope is not narrowed, wehave a neutral negation, that is, the event as a whole is denied. According to Givon,different strategies can be used for the negation of a single constituent. Some languagesfront the constituent to be negated; other languages move the constituent to the clausefinal position. Trumai has both strategies, but fronting is more common.
                                                                                                          2336.3.1. Negation in verbal predicates
6.3.1.1. Negating the verb         As already mentioned in chapters 3 and 5, to negate verbal predicates, theNegation particle tak follows the verb, or the verb plus other elements, such asauxiliaries. Negative clauses can present different word orders, depending on whether theclause is a simple statement or an answer to a question. When it is the second case (i.e.answer), the clause has a nominal-predicate configuration (cf. chapter 5, section 5.2.3 onthis issue). For instance:              A                                    V     Neg
(11)     hai-ts            chi(_in)            kuhmu tak.
         1-Erg Foc/Tense throw                              Neg
         ‘I didn’t throw it away.’              V             Neg                         A         O
(12)     kuhmu              tak         chi(_in)       hai-ts iyi.
         throw                  Neg Foc/Tens           1-Erg IYI
         ‘I didn’t throw (it) away.’ (answer to question: Did you throw (it)?!","[260, 261]"
"            As showed in chapter 2 (section 2.2.3), not all WH-questions have the morphemein, because the use of the WH-word itself is enough to indicate that information is beingrequested. The use of in just makes more explicit which piece of information is missingin the knowledge of the person who makes the question.",[198]
"However, not all clauses contain adverbs or Focus/Tense particles. In a text, we observethat in general the first clause presents the Focus/Tense particle or an adverb. Thefollowing clauses occur without any tense indicator, but by the discursive context and bythe indicators in the first clause, we can identify if the event described in each sentence isoccurring in the present, past or future. This means that a clause in isolation - that is, outof context - can be ambiguous in relation to tense, but in context there is no suchproblem. The examples below illustrate what was said here:(1)     ha    ami.                                       ‘I speak (habitually).’
        1Abs speak                                       ‘I spoke (still today).’
                                                         ‘I spoke yesterday.(2)   — ka’ne chay chi_in       ha hu’tsaha pine yi-ki.
        yesterday    Foc/Tens 1      see   1 friend Yi-Dat
        “Yesterday I saw a friend of mine.        in-is hen haami..
        it-Dat then 1 speak
        ‘Then I spoke...’
        Besides the first clause in a text, other clauses can contain Focus/Tense particles,under specific conditions. First, let us examine these particles in more detail.
                                                                                             169
5.1.1. The Focus/Tense particles ka in and chi in        In several Trumai examples, it is possible to observe the occurrence of acombination of morphemes: ka + in. For example:(3)     misu-s         kain    dewan_         yi        Sone.
        water-Dat          oldman YI                    drink
        ‘The old.man is drinking water.’
        This combination has an interesting behavior. On the one hand, ka + indo not form a single morpheme, because adverbs can be inserted between them, asalready mentioned in chapter 3 (section 3.4):(4)     Sa       tak          kanuk      in        ha     hat’ke.
        dance Neg                 then             1      in.future
        ‘I will not dance.’        On the other hand, the morphemes ka and in always work together in thiscontext, almost as if they were a lexicalized unit. The idea of unity is reinforced by twofactors: (i) the existence of another combination, chi in, which is similar in shape andwhich exhibits similar behavior; (ii) the elements in the combination seem not to have thesame value that they have when they appear by themselves in other contexts. This isespecially true for chi in. We can have two morphemes chiin the same clause, but withdifferent positions and functions:(5)     ine chi chiin      ofa ke     kasoro-tl
        3    Cop           hit Rizr dog-Dat
        ‘It was him who hit the dog.’
                                                                                           170        The idea of unit is also reinforced by the fact that ka in sometimes can bephonologically reduced to kan in fast speech. Example:(6)      a.axos yi kan dama          ke pitik      asix yi-ki.
           child YI         pull    KE monkey tail yI-Dat
           ‘The boy is pulling the tail of the monkey.’                 [FAST SPEECH]        b.axos yi kain dama            ke pitik      asix   yi-ki.
          child YI            pull     KE monkey tail       YI-Dat
           ‘The boy is pulling the tail of the monkey.’                 [SLOW SPEECH]
        The main function of ka_in and chi_in is to indicate that the information shouldbe the goal of the listener’s attention, for some of the following reasons: (i) theinformation is new; (ii) it is the information whose confirmation was requested bysomebody; (iii) it is very relevant information for the conversation and therefore needs tobe highlighted. When the clause has no ka_in and chi_in, it means that no element isbeing highlighted or deserves special attention. Examples:
New information (in answers to a specific question - new info comes in first position)
(7)   ham     de       axos yi      pumu?
      where already child YI        enter
        ‘Where did the child enter?       pike-ki     chi_in de         iyi pumu-n.
       house-Dat             already IYI enter-3Abs
       ‘S/he entered inhouse.’
                         the
Information that needs confirmation (answer to a specific question)
(8)     hu’tsa tak-a        hi chi?
        see     Neg-Quest 2       Cop
        ‘Aren’t you seeing?’        hahak, hu’tsatak     ka_in      ha    chi.
        no     see     Neg              1    Cop
        ‘No, I am not seeing.’
                                                                                            171(9)    kamayula-a        hi chi?
       Kamayura-Quest 2 Cop
       ‘Are you a Kamayura?’        ee,     kamayula   kain      ha chi.
        yes     Kamayura             1 Cop
        ‘Yes,     Iam a Kamayura.’Highlighting information: if the clause as a whole is in focus, then the Focus/Tenseparticle comes at the end. If only one piece of information is really salient, it comes at thebeginning of the clause, followed by the Focus/Tense particle.(10)   ha       lax ma’tsi ka_in.
       I        nose hurt
        ‘My nose is hurting.’       lemxo-k    ka_in ha lax mox ka.
       injury-Erg        1   nose swell Caus
       ‘An injury caused my nose to swell.’
       It is important to observe that there is in Trumai a morpheme in that occurs inWH-questions, right after the NP that contains the interrogative word:(11)   hamuna       in     hi wan    chomta-tke?
       where   Focus 2 PL play-Des
       ‘Where do you (PL) want to play?’(12)   hele in      hi katnon yi?

        When demonstratives are used as modifiers, it seems that the masculine andfeminine forms can freely substitute for each other, although the masculine form is moreoften used.

        In the case of nominal predicates, no changes are necessary from the normal wordorder, Pred Subj Cop. The scenario is different in the case of verbal predicates, becausethe order now is changed, becoming the same as nominal predicates. More interesting,now the Copula also occurs, and a morpheme ke appears after the verb. For example:Answer to question
               Vv                S          Cop

        b. katnon ke ka_in       — chi-n.                     ‘He works.’        In some cases, the presence of ke makes the difference between a nominal and averbal predicate: when a nominal root is involved, the presence of ke preserves thedifference between a nominal predicate (be an X) and a verbal one (have a X), as inexample (69).",[223]
"         However, as already mentioned, sometimes obligatory participants can be absentfrom the clause because of discourse continuity (i.e. zero anaphora) or because ofpragmatic questions (i.e. the participant is suppressed because it is indefinite or has lowdiscourse importance; cf. chapter 9 on voice manipulation). Thus, if the Dativeparticipant under investigation is not present in some clauses, we have to analyze theconditions that motivate its absence: is the participant absent because of discourse/pragmatic questions? Or is the participant omitted because it was just extra informationthat can de dropped anyway? A ‘goal’ participant that is obligatory will be omitted onlyin certain circumstances, while the one that is not obligatory can be omitted in any case.",[313]
"        An alternative analysis would explain the morphosyntax of a cleft as indicatingthe historical source of the modern construction, but would argue that, as in the case ofthe clefts for old obliques/NP Possessors that became main clauses (as argued in section5.1.3), the construction has been reanalyzed into a standard clause type. Thus, thepresence of the Copula, the morpheme ke relativizing the verb, and the Negation particleanuk would be explained. However, both the construction and the morpheme ke wouldhave changed their status as the construction was used more and more. Finally, it wouldhave been reanalyzed as a regular clause, with the difference that the verb comes in firstposition. The morpheme ke does not indicate relativization anymore; the fact that ke isoptional in the negative clauses would be evidence for reanalysis. The question is toidentify the function of ke in the examples (68-69b), (74), and (75) above.",[227]

Contrary to what was said inprevious work (Guirardello 1992), postpositions in Trumai have independent stress.                   lots’                        ‘Ablative’

         What are the differences and similarities between the case markers and thepostpositions? The difference is that the case markers are phonologically bound forms,while postpositions are free. The similarity is that both occur at the end of the NP, not onits head, as we would expect for the case markers if they were suffixes instead ofenclitics. This fact could lead us then to the question: are the Trumai case markers merelycliticized postpositions? We could say yes, because of the similarity in the site of location
*8 The Allative postposition is represented with the initial sound h in parentheses because we are not sure
about its occurrence (some few consultants claim that there is an initial h , but not the other consultants).
          The Allative seems to have another allomorph, ata, attested in only 2 cases:
(i)       ham ata           ‘to where’                   (ham ‘where, which place’)
(ii)      in ata            ‘to it (it=meeting) °        (in ‘it’)Since ham and in seem to be pronominal forms, we could say that ata is the Allative allomorph used with
pronouns. However, it is not so clear that this is the best analysis, because: (a) (h)ita is also attested with
pronouns (example (iii) below); (b) the other postpositions do not have special allomorphs for pronominal
forms (example (iv) below). It might be that the allomorph ara is simply morphologically conditioned,
occurring only with ham and in.
(iii)    inak a          (h)ita

              it Ablat
              ‘from it (it=event of reaching a place)
          A final remark with regard to the postposition (h)ita: sometimes it can alternate with the Dative
marker -ki, which can also mark ‘location’ if motion is involved. The difference between (h)ita and -ki is
that with -ki, the entity performing the motion reaches its target (cf. chapter 7)

However, this does not mean that NPsmodified by postpositions and case markers all have the same status. As we will see inchapter 7, there are motivations for treating the NPs marked as ‘Ergative and ‘Dative’ asdistinct from the NPs modified by the other case markers and from the NPs modified bypostpositions.","[100, 101, 102]"

                             chi   [NP     Verb in nominalized form]
          The specific element under focus (for example, an oblique such as by the man oron the monkey) would be isolated in first position. kKa would be the Copula forpresent/recent past tense, with chi being the Copula for distant past tense. A possibleinstance of this cleft construction would be something like:by the man Copula [house construction]          ‘It is by the man the construction of the house.’on the monkey Copula [Karu’s eyesight]                 on the

9 Observe that in the current data, a verbal root sometimes can behave as a noun without any Nominalizer in
the root (cf. chapter 10). This could be seen as a remnant of the fact that the current main verbs came from
nominalization of verbs that were eventually reanalyzed.
                                                                                            186being used, perhaps because the cleft was already losing its force and needed to berenewed. In modern data, in can be found in questions following NPs with WH-words (cf.section 2.2.3). So, the configuration of clefts changed to:               oblique    ka in   [NP     Verb in nominalized form]
               oblique    chiin   [NP     Verb in nominalized form]
       As said before, over time the nominalizations of verbs were reanalyzed as verbs inthe infinitive. The NPs that were their possessors were reanalyzed as their S/O arguments,and the other NPs were reanalyzed as A/DAT arguments:               A/DAT     ka in    [O/S_   Verb]
               A/DAT     chiin    [O/S    Verb]
       At some moment in the history of the language (stage 3), the cleft constructionreplaced the main clause, that is, it became the norm instead of a special kind of clause(Heine & Reh 1984 attest a similar development in African languages). This wasespecially true for clauses that were an answer to a question (in the modern language, wecan see that answers tend to have the presence of ka_in or chi_in). The sequences ofmorphemes ka + in and chi + in started being seen not as mere linear sequences ofmorphemes, but as morphemes in association. They were reanalyzed as units, becomingnow markers of focus which, at the same time, would carry tense information too. Later,in some cases, their use became optional. We know this because not all modern clauseshave the presence of ka_in or chi_in; however, the morphosyntax of the modern clauseswith ka_in/chi_in and the ones without them is basically the same: the original NPpossessor became Absolutive NP; the verb is “naked”, without inflectional marks. If the

These morphosyntactic facts aretrue for all main clauses, with or without ka_in/chi_in. Therefore, they came from thesame source (clefts),!° and if some of the modern clauses do not present the Focus/Tenseparticles, it is because these particles became non-obligatory (the clauses without themwould have not completive focus, but neutral focus, that is, no element under focus).

So, example (68a), which is an answer to thequestion ‘Do you work?’, could be interpreted as: ‘Yes, I am one who works’. The use ofthe negator anuk in example (75) suggests that the verb is relativized. Therefore, onepossible analysis would be to say that all the examples above are instances of cleftconstructions with focus on the verb/predicate.","[225, 226]"

          one    chicken     white YI
         “one white chicken’b. an adjective cannot be the head of an NP by itself. It always needs extra
   morphology:

             ‘the white one’
The morpheme -ake found in the example (79b) is not the ‘Possessive’ morpheme thatoccurs with nouns. Rather, the -ake here seems to be an indicator that the adjective is nowbehaving as a noun, being the head of the NP. In this sense, we could consider -ake akind of Nominalizer. The problem is that -ake does not occur with the adjective, butrather at the end of the NP (the morpheme yi occurs before -ake, not after it. If -ake was amere Nominalizer, we would have [tore-ake yi], which is not what we observe in the
'4 Perhaps the difference between this example and the previous one with wanach is that here a change of
state might be involved (become hard), while in the other only the state itself matters (be hard, behave in a
hard way).

        In the examples above, we can see that the [N Adj] construction is different from[NP NPmoa]. As already seen in section 2.1., the [NP NPmog] construction can havepluralizers both in the NP modifier and the NP being modified. The same is not true forthe [N Adj] construction, where only one pluralizer can be used, modifying the head ofthe NP (the Adj cannot be modified by another pluralizer, otherwise it would need to bethe head of another NP, which is not possible without extra morphology):(81)    a. fhuch kasoro dat     a                 yi]

   prefix tsi- , which is not a possessive mark, but rather seems to be linked to the

The function of tsi- is still not clear. Possibly it could be linked to mirativity, that is, thegrammatical marking of unexpected information. In mirative constructions, the speakersignals that the fact being reported was not expected or is a surprise to him/her, becausehe/she was not aware of it (or, as Delancey (1997:36) says: “..the proposition is onewhich is new to the speaker, not yet integrated into his overall picture of the world”).

Other negative words (‘nobody’, ‘nothing’, ‘never’)          As Givon (1984:323-328) points out, negative sentences normally are not used bythe speaker to convey new information about the verb or its arguments, but rather to denyinformation that the speaker thinks the listener has in mind. Any negative act has apresupposed (or backgrounded) portion and an asserted (or foregrounded) portion. Thebackground portion means that there is some shared knowledge between speaker andlistener, who have a kind of communication contract. The negation denies the assertedportion of the corresponding affirmative sentence, but the presupposed portion is notdenied. So, when a speaker negates an event involving an entity, he may deny that theevent happened, or that the entity was involved in the event, but he does not deny theexistence of the entity, which is assumed by the speaker. As Givén says, the negation ofthe referentiality of the entity is coded by other forms, such as the negative words nobodyand nothing.","[274, 275]"

Actually, the clause is not really in the negative modality, since no negationparticle is employed, but there is a sense of negative condition due to the semantics oft(a)ke. When contrasted with negative clauses that have tak, clauses with t(a)ke actuallypresent a semantic difference: the negative condition indicated by t(a)ke is permanent. Forexample:(29)    ami   tak   ka_in       chi-n.

        [ lit: He is deprived of speaking.]        The use of the ‘Privative’ t(a)ke is the only alternative way of expressing negationfor verbal roots. The occurrence of the negator n(i)kik, whose use is observed in nominalpredicates (cf. section 6.3.2.1), is not possible with verbal roots:(31)    a.sonetak ka_in        hachi.

Negating other elements of the verbal predicate             For the negation of a S or O argument, we have clefts® in the negative modality,with S/O in first position, followed by the Copula and the negator anuk:e S:
(32)         hachi anuk chi         katnon ke.
             1 Cop Neg Foc/Tens work Rlzr
             ‘It was not me who worked.”e O:

             2 sister Cop Neg 1-Erg call             Rlzr
             ‘It was not your sister that I called.’             To negate the A argument, the negator anuk is also employed, directly followingA, which is naturally in first position.:e      6A:
(34)         hai-ts anuk     hi adifle midoxos.
             l-Erg Neg       2   sister call
             ‘(It was) not me (who) called you sister.’
             The negation of the DAT argument and other kinds of NPs usually employs thenegator tak. The constituent being negated comes at the end of the clause; additionally,there is a pause between the end of the clause and the negated element:
3 The construction in example (32) is a cleft. Observe the occurrence of the Relativizer ke and the presence
of two morphemes chiin the construction: one is the Copula, negated by anuk; the other one is the
Focus/Tense particle. The negator anuk is never observed modifying the Focus/Tense particles (in simple
clauses, anuk and the Focus/Tense particles cannot co-occur; cf. section 6.3.2.1).
*As mentioned, the negator anuk and the Focus/Tense particles cannot co-occur in the same clause. The
exception is negative clefts, like the example above, where anuk and the particle co-occur. However, notice
that here the Focus/Tense particle is in its reduced form (i.e. chi). The occurrence of the full form (i.e.
chi_in) is not accepted by the Trumai consultants:
(i)          * ha chi anuk chi_in katnon ke.
             (It was not me whe worked.)The construction above needs further investigation, in order to be better understood.

        ‘I cut my hand, (but) not with a knife.’        Apparently, there are other possible strategies for negating the DAT argument,like the examples below. However, in example (38), one can wonder if what is beingnegated is really a DAT or rather a phrase that is the nominal predicate of a non-presentsubject. That is, perhaps in example (38) we do not have ‘I saw somebody, (but it was)not your sister’, but rather ‘I saw somebody. (Whom I saw) was not your sister’. Thepresence of the negator n(i)kik, used for negating nominal predicates (cf. section 6.3.2.1)suggests the second interpretation. See the discussion presented in section 6.3.5 withregard to this issue (and also with regard to the use of hahak).(37)    inatl-ekkafe    yi kiti Kumaru-tl.    hai, hahak.

        ‘I saw somebody, (but) it was not your sister.’6.3.2. Negation in non-verbal predicates        In the next section, we have an overall view of how negation is expressed innominal, equative, locative, and existential predicates.
                                                                                         239
6.3.2.1. Negation in nominal and equative predicates       Nominal predicates are negated via the Negation particle anuk. Since one of thepossible orders for nominal predicates is [Pred Subj (Cop)], no special strategies arenecessary to narrow the scope of anuk. The Focus/Tense particles cannot co-occur withanuk. Examples:(39)    axos   anuk    ha chi.
       child Neg     1 Cop
       ‘Tam not a child.’(40)   paye         anuk     hi chi.

          ‘I am not her husband.”       b. *t-eche anuk ka_in ha chi.
          (I am not her husband.)
       There is an alternative way to express the idea of negation in nominal predicates,involving use of the morpheme n(i)kik (probably another kind of nominal negator).","[261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"
"         With regard to iets’, as already mentioned in section 10.1.3, both the Causal/Reason clauses and the ‘Consequential’ ones have a morpheme iets’. The morpheme iets’of ‘Consequential’ clauses receives a prefix, tsi-, which seems to be an anaphoricmorpheme. The question is whether tsi- is a possessive morpheme, like the tsi- thatoccurs in nouns. If that is the case, what then would be the status of the morpheme iets’?",[435]
"        Juxtaposition and ‘coma intonation’ are used for the noun phrase coordination inTrumai (cf. chapter 2, section 2.1). In the case of coordination of clauses, the matter ismore complex. There are three attested ways to combine clauses. The question is whetherwe can call any of them real instances of ‘coordination’.
(i) in one case, we have the strategy described by Mithun: two clauses are juxtaposed, andthey are under the same intonational contour (the short pause between them is non-final).",[395]
"         In terms of control-and-behavior properties, S and A do not coincide either. Thestrategies for reflexivization and relativization used in Trumai do not show alignmentbetween S and A (cf. chapters 8 and 10, sections 8.2 and 10.4 respectively). The controlof anaphoric elements (coreference) is not helpful either. For the anaphoric possessivemarker tsi- and -ake, the antecedent is not obligatorily S or A; it is the NP that for logicalor other pragmatic questions is the best candidate (cf. chapter 2, section 2.4.2; cf. chapter8, section 8.2.6).",[318]
"        The question of identifiability raises the issues of topicality and discursiveimportance. The identification of an entity (or group of entities) may depend on howrelevant the entity is for the event that is being described. If the entity is not one of thecentral participants of the event, the speaker probably will not offer much informationabout it, and therefore, the listener will be less able to identify it. Conversely, if the entityis not so identifiable, it almost certainly is not so relevant or has no great importance inthe discourse, and therefore it will not be the goal of the listener’s attention.",[307]
"* Observe that here, the possessor here is being marked as O. This could be considered a case of external
possession (not ‘I pulled his shirt, but rather ‘I pulled him (by) the shirt.’). The question is to determine

         The non-presence of the 3Abs enclitic in a clause has some semantic effects. If theclause has an Intransitive verb, the non-presence of the enclitic coding the Absolutiveargument gives to the clause a generic sense with regard to the initiator of the event (i.e.an event is happening, but we do not know who exactly is performing it). If the clause hasa Transitive verb, the omission of the enclitic can signal that O has little discursiveimportance, that is, it produces an antipassive sense. This point will be discussed in moredetail in chapter 9 (section 9.1.1).","[122, 123]"
"        The morpheme ke of the third type is parallel to the enclitic of 3rd person -n/-ewith respect to the argument involved in their use (both are related to the Absolutive NP),but they are not of the same kind, since ke is not pronominal and it is not restricted to thethird person. Also, the enclitic occurs in complementary distribution with the lexical itemor pronoun which is the head of the Absolutive NP (cf. section 3.1.3), while ke occursmerely when the Absolutive NP is not adjacent to the verb (the NP is not in its “normal”position, but it is still present in the clause). Actually, the enclitic -n/-e and the morphemeke are incompatible, that is, they do not co-occur in the same clause: ke occurs when the8 It might be that we have one more morpheme ke, because the behavior of ke in negative clauses is not

"        However, a problem remains: what are the semantic differences between the twoways of expressing temporary states? So far, the only difference that could be detectedwas due to pragmatic factors: the Subj Adj or Adj Subj (Cop) order is selected dependingon which information the speaker wants to highlight:(83)    kafe      yi     supi.
        coffee    YI      bitter
        ‘The coffee is bitter.” (comment)(84)    supi     ka_in         kafe   yi.
       bitter Foc/Tens coffee YI
       ‘The coffee is bitter (new info).’ (answer to the question: Is the coffee sweet?)        In sum, it seems that the more adequate way of understanding attributivepredicates in Trumai is to take into account whether the attribute being expressed ispermanent or temporary. If permanent, we have a nominalized adjective in a nominalpredicate and no further complications. If temporary, we have a “hybrid” predicate, withtwo possibilities: (i) nominal syntax but not-nominal nucleus (and consequently, not-nominal Negation particle); (ii) verbal syntax but not-verbal nucleus and not-verbal
                                                                                           206Negation particle. We could go deeper into this issue and explore the nature of adjectivesin general. As some scholars point out, adjectives refer to entities that are more time-stable than verbs, but less than nouns (Givén 1984). This being so, it is not surprising thatin some languages adjectives shows properties of both nouns and verbs, since theyconstitute an in-between category. Perhaps the temporal attributive predicates in Trumaiplay along with this in-between nature, oscillating between nominal (permanent) or verbal(temporary) characteristics. Could we say that an attributive temporal predicate withnominal syntax indicates a slightly less temporary attribute than one with verbal syntax?","[231, 232]"
"       The reflexive effect is observed with Ist and 2nd person subjects, and it wasexemplified in chapter 8 (section 8.2.2). With regard to the antipassive effect, we observethat when a Trumai speaker is referring to an event that is habitual, and the “patient’’/second participant is completely irrelevant for what is being said about the event, the“patient” can be omitted from the clause. For example:(41)   hama kate-ki.
       1 eat fish-Dat
       ‘T ate a fish.’(42)    hama k’atsi         huk’an.
        1 eat be.seated     still
        ‘I am still eating, being seated.’
        [it does not matter what I am eating. What matters is the act of eating]
(43)        haadifle yi ka_in    ndakchi        ke  tak-e           axos-pa       wan ma_ hak.
        1     sister YI Foc/Tens work.w/hand    KE manioc.bread-Dat child-collect PL eat Purp
        ‘My sister is making manioc bread for the all the kids to eat.’
        [here, there is something to be said about the ‘manioc bread’ (they it will be eaten
         by the kids), so the Dative NP ‘manioc bread’ is present in the clause]
                                                                                                   354(44)   ha adifle dakchi          huk’an.
       1 sister work.w/hand still
       ‘My sister is still making (manioc bread).’
        [there are some activities that can be done with the hands, but the most referred to and
         usual one is ‘to make manioc bread’, so ‘manioc bread’ here is implicit by the cultural
         context. It does not need to be mentioned]
       The case of the omission of the DAT argument of Extended Transitive verbs is alittle more complicated. In general, the recipient NP of such verbs is omitted because itcan be recovered by context. However, there are examples in which the Dative NP isomitted because apparently it does not matter who the recipient is. For instance:         Vv                        NPéxg   NPaps        NPpat
(45)    kiti tak chi_in         hai-ts       @O         oD
       give Neg Foc/Tens
       ‘I will not give (it) away.’
       {some people were asking for my old cloth, but I decided not to give it away]        NPeérg                Vv           NPaps   NPpat
(46)   ine-k      chi_in     kiti tak      iyi     4)
       3-Erg     Foc/Tens    give Neg      IYI
        ‘He did not give (it) away.’
The question is to determine whether in the examples above there is suppression of theDative because of pragmatic questions (i.e. recipient is unimportant), or rather because itcan be recoverable by the context (i.e. a Dative NP such as ‘to anybody’ would beimplicit in the examples). And, in case the suppression is due to pragmatic factors, howshould we label the semantic effect obtained here? It could not be classified as anantipassive, since the Dative NP here is not “patient”-like. It is difficult to answer thesequestions; that is why the absence of the Dative NP in a Extended Transitive clause ishard to analyze. However, at least, one point can be made here: if the suppression is
                                                                                           355indeed pragmatically driven, then we can say that the principle behind the omission of theDative NP of a Extended Transitive verb is the same as the Dative NP of ExtendedIntransitive verbs: when the DAT argument is unimportant or irrelevant, it is notexpressed in the clause, being taken out of the scene; that would occur independently ofthe semantic role of the DAT argument (i.e “patient”-like or recipient).","[381, 382, 383]"
"          All these factors work together in conditioning the choice of a Dative marker: ifthe NP refers to a participant highly individuated, highly identifiable, and high indiscourse salience (animate), the enclitic -(V)t/ is used. If the participant is lessindividuated, or it is individuated but not so identifiable or not so salient, the enclitic -kiis used. If the participant is even less individuated, less identifiable and even less salient,the Dative mark will be -(V)s. Therefore, we can say that there is a hierarchy involved inthe use of the Dative marks:-(V)tl                   >               oki                  >           -(V)s
*   individuated                 * jindividuated but              * non individuated,   not
*   identifiable                   not identifiable                 identifiable
*   salient                      * individuated   but   not       * non individuated,   not
                                   salient                          salient
                                 * non individuated,
                                   identifiable
         The only exceptions to this hierarchy are:(i) the NP with a SG inanimate possessed noun, whose possessor is anaphoric. Even     though the noun is inanimate (therefore, less salient), it receives the mark -(V)zl. It     might be that the nature of the possessor has some influence here, given that     anaphoric possessors are more definite;(ii) proper nouns, which are highly individuated, highly identifiable, salient, and yet they     can choose between -(V)¢l or -ki, instead of receiving only -(V)tl. Perhaps the use of     -(V)tl with proper nouns expresses more intimacy of the speaker in relation to the     person being referred to (something like the use of definite article with proper nouns     in Portuguese, which imply more closeness of the speaker in relation to the person
                                                                                                                    281       mentioned).” So, -(V)tl would indicate more proximity in relation to the individual       being referred to, and -ki less proximity. This proximity in some sense can be       correlated with the question of identifiability: a more identifiable entity is better       known by you, and being better known, it is closer to you, too.","[308, 309]"
"        However, a question arises: why does the causee in the causative constructionwith an Intransitive verb not share the ‘agency’ with the causer as well? Why is it not alsomarked as Ergative? Perhaps because this causee cannot be considered an agent, given thenature of the event expressed by the Intransitive verb: a typical Intransitive event has onlyone participant; there is no patient in an Intransitive event. Thus, the causee of acausativized Intransitive verb is not an agent, since there is no affectee; rather, the causeeis also the participant affected by the event. Therefore, since the causee of causativizedIntransitive verbs is the patient-like participant in the event, it makes sense that thiscausee is marked in the same way as patients of simple Transitive clauses, i.e., asAbsolutive.",[346]
"         In other words, the function of the markers -(V)tl, -ki, and -(V)s is to markelements that are semantically a kind of goal for the event, independent of whether theelement is obligatory or not. Therefore, semantically speaking, the occurrence of theDative markers with non-obligatory participants is not problematic, since they can be alsobe seen as ‘goal’ participants. The problem is with regard to the obligatory status of the
                                                                                              285NP: when a clause presents more than one NP marked as Dative, how can we determinewhich NP is an obligatory argument, and which one is not? For example:(78)   — tsul       iyi   ka_in     chamlo   ma   ke   sida-s_     miso-es.
         river.turtle IYI Foc/Tens early       eat KE leaf-Dat full.river-Dat
         ‘In the time of full river, the river turtle eats leaves early.’It seems to us that the best strategy for that is to compare the clause in question with otherclauses where the same verb is used. By the comparison, we can see which subtype ofDative participant is consistently required by the verb; the participant that is obligatorywill be the one that is consistently present in all the clauses.","[312, 313]"
"       When the order is [S Pred], alternation between -s and -is is possible (although theuse of -s with words ending in vowels is preferred):(71)    a.hama-s     hayotl    take.
          1 eat-S 1 sleep Des
          “When I eat, I want to sleep.’       b. ha ma-is hayotl take.
          1 eat-IS 1 sleep Des
          ‘When I eat, I want to sleep.’       A question is then raised: is the morpheme -(V)s here the same as the Dativemarker that occurs with NPs? In terms of allomorphy, the morpheme -(V)s here isconsistent with the Dative marker that occurs with NPs; that is, the Dative marker -(V)salso presents the allomorphs -(i)s and -(e)s (cf. chapter 2, section 2.3). In terms ofsemantics, there are also some similarities: the Dative marker -(V)s can also be foundmarking NPs that refer to time, with the sense of ‘(being) in the time’ (cf. chapter 7,section 7.2.3.2). The problem is that, unlike the Dative-Complement clauses, theTemporal/Conditional clause is not nominalized; on the contrary, it can receive the 3Absenclitic. There is no evidence that the clause is being treated as a NP. The morpheme yi,which occurs at the end of NPs, is not observed in Temporal clauses between the Verb +3Abs and the marker -(V)s , that is, we do not find: [V-3Abs yi]-(V)s.
                                                                                              393        Therefore, we cannot equate the marker -(V)s in Temporal/Conditional clauseswith the Dative marker that occurs with NPs. Perhaps both markers were historicallyrelated, but in the current data, we analyze them as being different morphemes.","[420, 421]"
"         However, if ine was originally a demonstrative pronoun, now it seems to be only apersonal one, because its use as modifier of a head noun in an NP seems not to bepossible, or at least it is controversial. According to one consultant, this example wouldbe acceptable:(51)     [ine axos yiJ-ki           chi_in    ha fa.
          that child yI-Dat          Foc/Tens 1 _ beat
         ‘I beat that child.’° There is one example that suggests that the difference between nina and ina is not only one of distance,
but also proximity in relation to locutor or interlocutor: in a letter to a friend, a Trumai used nina (here)
when refering to her own village and ina (there) when referring to the friend’s village.
 10 ni’de can also be used to contrast situations:
(i)      fa       maxke-s     de        aloke haa        hat’ ke.
          kill/fit ?-S          already fast      1 Dual in-future

         this.one kill/nit Neg already 1 Dual in.future long              already 1 Dual in-future
         ‘In contrast (in this other situation), if we do not kill anything, we will take time.’
                                                                                              34The example above was not spontaneously given by a speaker, but it was ratherconstructed on the basis of patterns observed in the language and presented to theconsultant for an opinion. So, even though the consultant accepted the example, thequestion remains whether she really says it. A similar example was presented to anotherconsultant, who refused the use of ine as modifier, saying that it did not make sense:(52)    a.ni’de        misu                               ‘this mirror’
          this(masc) water/mirror        b. ka’ne      misu                                ‘that mirror’
           that(masc) water/mirror        c. *ine misu                                      ?*he mirror’ (strange, nonsense)
        Therefore, it seems that ine is a personal pronoun indeed. The question is to knowif it was originally the medial demonstrative pronoun (with the full demonstrative setbeing: ni’de - ine - ka’ne    ‘this’ - ‘that’ -‘yon’) or if Trumai has another form for themedial demonstrative pronoun.","[59, 60]"
"And why are A and DAT insensitive to this morpheme (i.e. why can A and DAT be farfrom the verb without triggering the occurrence of ke)?(iii) why does Trumai have the two Focus/Tense particles ka_in and chi_in?

4 For the affricates, there is no ‘dental-alveolar’ distinction. For this reason, although phonetically the
affricates are [ ts] and [ ts’], in the phonological level we represen them without the dental mark [_], since at
the phonological level this detail is not important.
> Greenberg also notes that ejectives are frequently misanalyzed as clusters in some grammars. The previous
analysis of Trumai ejectives (Guirardello 1992) appears to be another such case.
        The Trumai tap is /r/, and the liquids are /I/ and //. The lateral fricative wasanalyzed in previous works as an allophone of /I/ following /t/ (Becquelin 1975;Guirardello 1992), but it is better analyzed as a separate phoneme because: (i) it is notclear that a /t/ really precedes the lateral fricative (as already mentioned in Guirardello1992, sometimes the realization of the sound seems to be ['t], sometimes only [%]); (ii)given the phonetic presence of [t], the sequence [t?] would be better analyzed as anothercomplex segment rather than a cluster, for phonotactic reasons: there are no other cases ofthe combination stop + liquid, and as mentioned above we do not find the syllable typeCCV or VCC with other consonants; (iii) at least one minimal pair was found: [ka'le]
‘thus’ - [ka'te] ‘small.lizard’. The only question in need of further research is whether thephoneme is better treated as a lateral fricative or an affricate (i.e. /t/ or /tt/). For themoment, it will be treated as a lateral fricative, until we find more evidence of itsphonological alignment with either the affricate or the fricatives.","[29, 30]"
"        There is one extra problem that needs to be discussed: the behavior of ke innegative answers with a verb in first position (such as in example 74) is not exactly thesame as the ke that occurs when the Absolutive NP is non-adjacent to verb, because the

         The question is how to deal with examples in which the clause does not have theCopula chi, and there is a morpheme yi. Is this yi the “Copula” or the NP-finalmorpheme? For instance:(175)    atsiwe             tak        = yi        ka_in            Maria.

         ‘The name of my mother is Mary.’         Example (173) above suggests the analysis in (176a) below. However, it wouldnot be unreasonable to propose the analysis in (176b), since: (a) the order [S Cop Pred] isattested with the Copula chi; (b) (i)yi can be parallel to the Copula chi, as in example(172); (c) the nominal predicate does not always need to have the NP-final morphemeyi),                     P                                       Subj

verbs, since the presence of only one argument makes it easier to analyze the organization of the clause. We
use Intransitive clauses as the basis for the comparison, but the facts presented here (i.e. position of enclitic;
word for negation) are also valid for Extended Intransitive and (Extended) Transitive clauses. When
necessary, we present information on these kinds of clauses too.
'S Nominal predicates can also present an alternative order (Subj Cop Pred), depending on pragmatic
factors:

'6 As already mentioned in chapter 3 (section on Copula), there are actually two possibilities for the
nominal predicate:
(i) Occurrence of Copula:                        dika_in   chi-n.    ‘She is a woman.’
(ii) Occurrence of morpheme iyi:                 dika_in iyi-n.      ‘She is a woman.’The morpheme iyi/yi and the Copula cannot co-occur. Usually, the Copula is used, but when it does not
occur, the presence of iyi seems to be obligatory if the 3Abs enclitic -n/-e is used (iyi is the site where the
enclitic attaches).

nominal predicates: the use of n(i)kik. See chapter 6, section 6.3.2.1.

5.2.2. Nominal roots as verb
          In chapter 2, we saw that a nominal root can function as a nominal word (‘an X’)or as a verbal word (‘to have an X’). If it functions as a verb, occurring in a verbalpredicate, it shows the behaviors observed with this kind of predicate (examples (b)below):Nominal vs. verbal, first person:

                                                                 (lit: I have a woman)Nominal versus verbal, third person:

          Sometimes both nominal and verbal predicates can become very similar in form,and that represents a problem of analysis. Basically, when the clause is an answer to aspecific question, and the verb codifies the new information or the information that needsto be confirmed, the clause has the structure of a cleft construction with the verb in focus.","[220, 221, 222]"
"Therefore, it behaves differently from verbs:(132)      *paye        ha chi-tke.

        here, the speaker has less respect for the person who is the subject of the talk -
         perhaps a more casual speech]        In relation to the occurrence of the Copula in dialogues, some remarks need to bemade: observing the Trumai discourse, we can see that the morpheme chi is very frequentin use. However, not all occurrences of the form chi represent the use of the Copula. Wehave to distinguish between the chi ‘Copula’ and the chi which     is reduction of theFocus/Tense particle chi_in. Historically, the chi of the Focus/Tense particle came fromthe Copular use (cf. chapter 5 for details), but its modern function and meaning are nowdifferent. In order to determine whether an occurrence of chi is the Copula or a reducedform of [chi_in], we have to look at the distribution of the morpheme in question, since
                                                                                                                   125chi ‘Copula’          and chi reduction of [chi_in] occur in environments that are similar, butnot quite the same. Also, in elicitation the replacement of the occurrence of chi by thewhole unit /chi_in] is a good strategy for the differentiation, since the replacement isallowed only when chi is the reduction of the Focus/Tense particle.'?","[149, 150, 151]"
"Given that Trumai is an isolate language, there is no possibility of comparing it to othergenetically related languages, a fact that limits the work of analysis (comparison withother languages of the same family can be very insightful, because the developmentsobserved in the related languages can help the linguist to understand better the facts thats/he is observing in the language under study). Thus, in the absence of genetically relatedlanguages to compare, the contribution of typological studies has been very important formy work, because these studies provide a view of what kinds of phenomena are observedin the languages of the world. Knowing that some of the patterns found in Trumai werealready attested in other languages (therefore, they are possible in human languages), Ihad a better basis to understand and describe the Trumai data.
                                                                                           XXii
        Historical studies, such as those made by Heine and Reh (1984) and Heine (1993,1997) have also been very insightful for me, giving me an idea of how historicaldevelopments can give rise to some patterns observed in a language. Some of Heine’sideas were the basis for my analysis of the Trumai auxiliaries (chapter 4) and for theinternal reconstruction that I propose in chapter 5. As J mention in the latter chapter, theinternal reconstruction presented there does not have the purpose of describing thesynchronic data; it is merely a way of bringing new light on the facts observed in the data,seeing them from a different perspective. Of course, when we talk about historicalchanges and the rise of new patterns, several questions have to be addressed, such as:(i) how can we avoid the danger of transferring diachronic analyses to the synchronicgrammar?(ii) how can we recognize that a morpheme or a construction is still the same or is alreadya “new” one? Which or how many criteria are necessary to qualify a morpheme/construction as reanalyzed? Are semantic and pragmatic differences enough, or do weneed also syntactic, morphological and phonological differences?(iii) how can we avoid performing the analysis of linguistic data only on the basis ofsyntax? That is, how can we use the evidence from syntax without being completelydriven by it, to the point of ignoring other levels, such as semantics and pragmatics?","[24, 25]"
"        It is not clear if this analysis is desirable; that is, if it is really necessary todistinguish every single instance of ke as being a different case, or if it would not bebetter to unify them. It is hard to make a decision. An additional fact that deservesattention is that a verb negated by tak patterns together with nominal elements in othercontexts, for example, in imperative constructions (cf. chapter 3, section 3.3.4, andchapter 6, section 6.4). Thus, perhaps the presence of morpheme ke in negative answershas to do with the negative modality itself rather than to the “answering question”construction. In the moment, what it is visible is that ke here interacts with both focus andnegation.",[228]
"The full form iyi is also quite frequent, occurring in cases when the noun is not mentioneddue to discourse continuity (i.e. zero anaphora). The morpheme is also often found in NPsin which the head noun is modified by an adjective.(167)   iwir fapti-s ka_in    make [huruts        yi].

        1 see       Foc/Tens   Indian individual beautiful    -Dat
        ‘I saw the beautiful Indian.’        It is difficult to determine the semantic contribution of this morpheme to the NPwhere it occurs. The morpheme (i)yi is reminiscent of many things, but is not consistentlyany of them:(1) not a pronoun: the allomorph iyi occurs by itself in the NP; therefore, it might beconsidered pronominal. The allomorph yi can occur in an NP that has a 3rd personpronoun, that is, [Pro yi]. If we say that yi is also pronominal, then we would have twopronouns in the same NP, a fact not otherwise attested in Trumai. Therefore, we have toconclude that yi is not pronominal. But then, can a morpheme have an allomorph that ispronominal (iyi) and another one (yi) that is not? And if the allomorph iyi is reallypronominal, why can it not receive case marking by itself? We cannot have [iyi]-ki(Dative) nor {iyi]-k (Ergative), only [noun yi]-ki or [noun    iyi]-k, as in the example (166)above. As we can see, there are problems in considering the morpheme (i)yi a pronoun.
(2) not an indicator of definiteness: at first sight, we could imagine that (i)yi is a definitearticle, given its frequency of use, its occurrence in 3rd person noun phrases, and itsposition in the NP (i.e., the rightmost element). The problem is that this morpheme alsooccurs with indefinite NPs, as we can see in the example (168a) above, and it co-occurswith pronouns (examples 160-161). Therefore, we cannot call it a definite article. On theother hand, it is noticeable that the use of (i)yi is more frequent among the youngspeakers, who are all bilingual in Portuguese (our unquantified impression is that older
                                                                                                  66
people use (i)yi much less frequently than younger speakers). It might be that the high useof definite articles in Portuguese - which are employed even with proper names - isinfluencing the younger speakers of Trumai, and perhaps because of such influence, thesespeakers are attributing new functions to (i)yi. However, this is just a hypothesis thatneeds to be explored.
(3) not an indicator of referentiality: we could say that the morpheme (i)yi is linked to theexpression of referentiality, because many of the NPs where (i)yi occurs have a referent(if it is identifiable or not to the listener is another question). The problem is to deal withexamples such as (170):(170)    [yaw-t’a              yi]   ka_in       [pitik     yi].
         human.being-NzrEx       Foc/Tens monkey
         ‘The monkey was a human being.’ (lit: the monkey is an ex-human being)
In (170), the NP /yaw-t’a yi] is the predicate of the clause; so, what is being made hereis a predication, rather than a simple reference. It is true that the predicate in (170) isnominal, and nominal predicates can be referential. The question is to explain theoccurrence of yi both in the subject and the predicate. If the function of the morpheme(i)yi is merely to indicate referentiality, why do we have the “overuse” observed in theexample above? What is the motivation for that?","[90, 91, 92]"
