           that can be answered yes or no.                                 Read these statements that you
           learned in Lesson 6 and compare                                them with the questions.           a.        T    tka.                        - becomes                   Ka nétka?                            ‘Is he sleeping?!

            is changed                to a question?                 (ti)

"     Bach sentence consists of the same set of words.    They are, however,
     arranged differently.    Each arrangement expresses a different attitude
     by the speaker toward the action that he is talking about.     In the
     first one he is making a simple statement of fact.     In the second
     sentence he is not certain of the fact and is posing it as a question.
     The third sentence expresses his wish that the action be done, and
     forms a command.   These notions and the ways in which they are ex-
     pressed               are        called               modes        (or mood).",[285]

Arikara.   By the time you have completed all of the 50 lessons, you will
be able to use your new language skill in talking about one or more
individuals engaged in a variety of activities in the past, present, or
future.   You will know, among other things, the Arikara names for various
tribes, utensils, animals, colors, everyday items of clothing, and how to
greet a person.   You will, moreover, be able to form both simple and
 complex        sentences,
       The lessons begin very simply, taking you one step at a time into
the Arikara language.   Gradually the lessons become more complex, each
one building on what you have learned previously.   This gives you a firm
foundation for the basics and a usable vocabulary.",[13]

           true of the English language.   For example, an English                                                 word may end in
           ng (sing), but no English word begins with that sound.                                                    If you learn
           the possible positions of each Arikara sound, you will                                                  be able to say

Arikara verb forms involving more than one person are quite different
from English.  Consequently, to avoid confusion, more than one in
Arikara will be called non-singular rather than plural.   Non-singular
verb    forms     are     divided           into       two categories:                          _                  dual                      meaning           two                  plural          -         meaning more than                     two.",[155]
