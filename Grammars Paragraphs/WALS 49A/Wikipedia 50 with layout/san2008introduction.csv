     The main divergence from Giles’ orthography is in the representation of the voiceless stops:
Giles represents aspirated stops as p, t, k and unaspirated stops as b, d, g. Whilst not ideal, the
orthography I use here (using ph, s, kh) arose as a functional stop-gap adjusted to the current literacy
situation of Duna speakers in the Lake Kopiago area. All the Duna speakers with whom I spoke
about this issue strongly associated the graphemes g, d, g with prenasalised stops, and found the
employment of these letters to represent voiceless stops extremely confusing and very obstructive
to reading or writing Duna. A major effort to train people in the conventions of the standard (that
is, Giles’) orthography will be necessary in order to make this system viable in the north-west Duna
region.
Chapter 3Word classes
3.1    Introduction
This chapter introduces Duna word classes as referred to in this thesis, identifying
different groups to which a root form may belong, and which predict certain aspects
of a word’s use, including its distribution, function, and structural capacities. The
chapter includes some additional comments on features of certain word classes or
subclasses that are not discussed in detail elsewhere in this thesis, and lists all known
members of smaller closed classes for quick reference.
    The word types I present here are largely categories that can be defined on the
basis of morphosyntactic characteristics. For example, roots that belong to the class
of verbs can be marked with certain bound forms that are not generally applicable to
the members of other classes. However, the types are functionally and semantically
as well as formally motivated, and in some cases no clearly distinguishing morpho-
syntactic features are identified; certain words are presented together because they
belong to the same kind of semantic domain, or share a similar function.
    Sections 3.2 and 3.3 describe formal and functional features of the major Duna
word classes, nominals and verbs. Members of the nominal and verb classes are
generally used in denoting entities and events, respectively, and are thus typically
fundamental to establishing fairly basic ingredients of a described situation (who are
the participants, what are they doing?). Nominals are divided into two open classes
(common nouns and proper names), and one closed class, personal pronouns. The
overall category of verb contains three closed classes of morphologically and func-
tionally distinct verbal roots, as well as an open class of regular verbs.
    Verb adjuncts (§3.4) are similar to verbs but have somewhat distinct distribu-
tional properties, and adjectives (§3.5) comprise a class of words which show both
nominal and verbal properties.
   The closed classes of quantifiers and demonstratives are treated in §3.6 and §3.7,
and §3.8 looks at a ‘mixed bag’ of words and expressions that are used in talking                                           69

about time and manner. Duna interrogative forms (§3.9) group together as a func-
tional class, but also cut across the classes described in §3.2 - §3.8. Sections 3.10
and 3.11 describe some other minor groups of words, including dependent postposi-
tional modifiers, linkers, sentence pro-forms, and some conventionalised utterances
or ‘sound gestures’ such as attention-seekers and exclamations.","[97, 98, 99]"
"4.2.4.4    Right dislocation
In what I term right dislocation in Duna a participant is referenced or reiterated
following the predicate. The final verb of the clause has closing intonation, and the
final NP is tacked on as an afterthought. Right dislocation is used in clarification,
for example to repair a sentence that contains hesitations, truncations, repetitions
and/or referential ambiguity (106 and 107), or to expand on something the speaker
feels they have described erroneously or imprecisely (108).(106)     ho-ra-ka        khena ra.. anda ngi-ya. ingini ndu su.

Chapter 5Constituents of nominal phrases
5.1     Introduction
This chapter outlines the structure of nominal phrases (NPs) and describes in more
detail the words that can occur as part of them, including common nouns, adjectives,
quantifiers, demonstratives, proper names, personal pronouns, and interrogatives.
The chapter examines properties that are relevant at the word level (for example,
the morphological structure of nouns), and those that apply at the phrase level (for
example, what words do and do not typically co-occur within an NP), as well as out-
lining some features of NPs that have to do with the clause as a whole (for example,
reference properties of personal pronouns with regard to grammatical relation). It is
mainly concerned with free and phrasal rather than bound constituents of referring
expressions, the latter being described in the following chapter.
    Nominal phrases are (potentially) referring expressions that describe entities,
typically those that are participants required by the predicate that heads the clause
in which they occur. A nominal phrase functions as one constituent within the larger
structure of the clause. It may consist of a single word, or a sequence of words that
follow a fixed templatic order. Morphological operations that relate to features such
as specificity or semantic role are applied once to this constituent as a whole.
    The clause shown in (109) contains one nominal phrase, describing the single
participant (the subject) required by the monovalent verbal predicate he- ‘cry’. This
NP includes a common noun ima ‘woman’, an intensified adjective khera kone ‘very
old’ that describes a further property of the woman, and the quantifier ndu which
indicates both singularity and indefiniteness.(109)   [ima   khera kone    ndu] he-ya...

              NP                   Predicate
        ‘A very old woman was crying...’ (T/YS:KGV7.22)   A common noun such as ima in (109) is the notional head of the NP, in the sense                                        127

that it “refers to the same entity that the whole phrase refers to” (Payne 1997:73).1
A nominal phrase that is notionally headed by a common noun (a ‘common noun
NP’) can consist of a common noun (N), one or more Adjectives (A), a quantifier
(Q) and a Demonstrative (Dem), which occur in fixed order, as shown in Figure
5.1. In nominal phrases that include a spatial demonstrative, an NP marker (§6.3)
is obligatory. Note that adjectives, quantifiers, and demonstratives can function
pronominally as well as adnominally, as the notional head does not need to be overt
in the phrase as a common noun if its identity is recoverable from context, for
example if it is referenced in the preceding clause or sentence or is a salient item in
the current speech setting.

                       Figure 5.1 Ordering of words in a nominal phrase
    Common noun NPs can also include a phrase-initial constituent that denotes a
possessor. This possessor can be expressed as an unmarked NP or a postpositional
phrase (formed with the NP postposition -ya ‘BEN’, §6.5.4). I notate this phrasal
constituent as ‘XPposs ’. Nominal phrases that exemplify the different possiblities of
the template shown in Figure 5.1 are presented and discussed in §5.2.
    The clause shown in (110) contains two NPs, describing the two participants
required by the bivalent verbal predicate, sa- ‘strike’. The first NP consists of a
(CS-marked) proper name (PN), Polo-ka, the subject argument. This is a ‘Proper
name NP’ (NPP N ), further discussed in §5.3.2. The second nominal phrase consists
of a personal pronoun (PPro) no ‘1SG’. This is a ‘Personal pronoun NP’ (NPP P ro ),
discussed in §5.3.1.","[154, 155, 156, 157]"

  44
    This in turn supports the function of contrasted subject marking as an indicator of pragmatic
prominence, rather than of syntactic structure.

         * Kenny hit Justin and Melo (CD)   Example (443) shows (442) with the CS-marked NP removed. KK judged that
Melone Jetine =kheno could not be interpreted as an object NP, but could easily be
understood as a subject NP in which the object NP was elided, as shown in (443b).
Other speakers made similar judgements concerning other structurally comparable
examples, typically rejecting the use of dependent pronouns in object NPs, and
readily identifying any NP that included a dependent pronoun as a subject argument.(443)    a. Melo-ne Jeti-ne =kheno so
              PSN - PR   PSN - PR =3 DL     strike.PFV

              PSN - PR   PSN - PR =3 DL     strike.PFV
              ‘Melo and Justin hit [someone]’    Judgements such as those illustrated in (442) and (443) suggest that dependent
third person pronouns function as nominative (or at least non-accusative) markers.
However, the more highly contextualised data shows that dependent pronouns do
sometimes occur in object NPs. This reference strategy typically coincides with
pragmatic prominence of the NP, in that it represents a highly noteworthy piece of
information.45
    Example (444) shows a constructed sentence in which the inclusion of a de-
pendent pronoun in an object NP was judged acceptable. The hypothetical context
for this example is that the addressee has been hassling the speaker to give them a
particular object; the speaker tersely draws the addressee’s attention to the fact that
she has already given the item to someone else.(444)    na      Nikolo =kho ngu.

         ‘I gave [it] to Nicole.’ (so you won’t be getting it!) (CD/XIV:109)    Example (445) shows an excerpt from a rindi malu narrative. Prior to this ex-
cerpt the main character, an ancestral spirit, has been introduced and his domestic
situation (making a garden, living with his wife and son) has been explained. Line
(445a) details how this spirit has planted certain vegetation; these plants are typ-
ically steambaked with meat in an earth oven, so this information implies that the
spirit is planning some cooking. At line (445b) the speaker reveals the identity of
  45
   Dependent pronouns thus in effect provide a way of marking contrast or emphasis on arguments
where CS-marking is not available for this purpose.

the spirit’s intended meal in a dramatic way; it is his own son that he wants to eat.
The object NP includes a pronoun, as the identity of this argument is particularly
noteworthy. Note also that the verbal predicate is inflected with the verbal morph-
eme -raka, that marks surprising events (§9.3.3.3).(445)   a. ayu lira,       alupa, kerepa-tia hi-ya       ha-ta    ko.

            ‘Living there, this one, [he] wanted to eat the son,...’ (T/RS:270405ia)   NPs that are marked as locative with -ta show similarities to object NPs in that
depedent ponouns are not readily accepted in isolated sentences, but do occur in
contextualised material where the NP is pragmatically prominent.
   Example shows a rejected constructed sentence in which I included a dependent
pronoun in a LOC-marked NP.(446)   a. sirako        ka     Petrusi-ta wana-no.

            * You ask Petrus tomorrow (CD/VIII:79)    Examples (447) and (448) alternatively show more highly contextualised ex-
amples in which LOC-marked NPs include dependent pronouns. These NPs occur
in situations of emphatic or contrastive identification, for example where the speaker
wishes to underline the fact of direct communication with the precise referent of the
NP.(447)   inu-ka Wakili =kho-ta wana ngoae             ruwa-ta...

6.6. NP marking: grammatical relation and prominence                             217
    In sum, the use of third person pronouns constitutes a reference strategy that
is typically associated with animacy and discourse prominence but can, especially
in the case of non-subject participants, additionally indicate pragmatic prominence.
This situation is somewhat parallel to contrasted subject marking, which is formally
associated with a particular grammatical function, but can, especially in the case of
S (as opposed to A) arguments, mark contrastive focus; and also to -nga marking,
which can indicate a structurally relevant feature, reflexivity (a single participant
occupies both the A and P argument slots of a bivalent clause) and/or emphatic
identification.
Chapter 7Some complex predicate structures
7.1   Introduction
Predicates of verbal clauses in Duna often consist of a verb only, in the sense that
a single inflected verb root occurs clause-finally, and denotes ‘what’s going on’,
determining the argument structure of the clause and the semantic roles of the par-
ticipants. Predicates of verbal clauses may also be complex, being “composed of
more than one grammatical morpheme (either morphemes or words) each of which
contributes part of the information ordinarily associated with a head” (Alsina et al.
1997).
    This chapter identifies five major complex predication structures in Duna, sum-
marised in Table 7.1.","[243, 244, 245, 246, 247]"
"(833)     Monika =kho nu            ware-na.
          PSN       =3SG netbag weave-SPEC
          ‘(I see) Monica is weaving a bilum.’ (CD/III:25)     The association of na-marking with sight raises the issue of whether specificity
marking on final verbs should be construed as part of the visual evidential category
(§9.2.3).43 It is unproblematic to say that -na in some ways ‘fills a gap’ in the evid-
ential paradigm, which does not include a ‘current visual’ category morpheme (that
is, lacks a form that describes seeing as contemporaneous with utterance). How-
ever, it is important to recognise that -na does not treat the semantics of ‘sight’ in
the same way that visual evidential markers do. With evidential markers, there is
a strong implication that the subject argument is someone other than the informant
(see, for example, (1062)). A visual evidential implies observation rather than par-
ticipation. However, with na-marking there is no such implication, and this marker
occurs freely in declarative sentences with first person subjects; see examples (827)
and (830).
     I turn now to an issue of analysis that I do not explore in detail in this thesis,
but which is significant to the development of a more comprehensive description
of the Duna language. In examples (827) - (833) I identify the form -na that is
added to an uninflected verb root as the specificity marker, that is, the same form
  43
    One argument that can be brought against this is that being able to physically see the predicated
event is not an absolute prerequisite of the morpheme’s deployment, as shown by its use with the
predicate khou ‘pain’ in (828), for which there is no clear visual manifestation, or in (832) where
-na occuring on a ‘sound’ verb that represents a birdcall. However, this latter example at least is, if
anything, supportive of an evidential interpretation as it is redolent of the use of the perfective visual
evidential marker in indexing the witnessing of sonic events (see example (756) in §9.2.3.2).
9.3. Information status markers                                                                345
that is used to indicate that the referent of a nominal phrase is a specific (and typic-
ally definite) individual (§6.3.2.1). As is shown in the following chapter, -na SPEC
can also be added following an inflected final verb in a main clause, with similar
‘attention-drawing’ implications. There are also a number of complex constructions
in Duna in which the specificity marker -na is added to a verb (inflected or other-
wise). These include for example: relative clauses (see (682), (394)); background
reason/cause clauses (in which case the clause is overtly marked with either =nia,
-ka, or -ta, see (704), (574)); nominalised purpose clauses (often on verbs that are
marked with -noi, see (800)); complement clauses headed by the verb wa- ‘do’ (see
(345), (448)); and other reified propositions, where the activity described by the
clause is nominalised as a named situation (994) or process (30). In these cases the
verb to which -na is added can generally be regarded as heading an embedded, sub-
ordinate, and/or nominalised clause rather than an independent verbal clause. The
additional use of a SPEC-marked clause as an independent utterance seems to be an
example of ‘insubordination’ (Evans 2007).
    It can be noted in examples (827) to (833) (and elsewhere) that I typically
treat definite-marked final verbs that are sentence-final as heads of ordinary verbal
clauses. However it follows that if -na is an NP marker, its use in final clauses could
be more appropriately described as a nominalisation construction that is function-
ally related to information status, rather than an example of a potentially inflectional
information status marker. A sentence such as (830) could be analysed as a ‘non-
embedded nominalization’ (Matisoff 1972) and rendered as ‘(It is the case that) I
am spinning yarn!’, or as a cleft construction, ‘It is I who am spinning yarn!’. A
comprehensive assessment of this issue demands a thorough description of com-
plex constructions, as well as an explicit account of information structure in Duna
conversation and extended discourse, areas that I do not embark upon in this thesis
owing to time and data constraints. As a practical measure, I treat -na SPEC as it
occurs in main clauses as a morpheme that is functionally equivalent to an informa-
tion status marker, as it can: derive a finite predicate, ascribe temporal value (present
time) to the clause in which it occurs, and convey an attitude (a judgement/assertion
of ‘noteworthiness’) to the information that is encoded in the utterance.44 I translate
final verbs that are marked with the specificity marker as if they are heads of main
verbal clauses unless there is uncontroversial indication that the clause is not inde-
  44
      cf. Woodbury (1985): In examining ‘participle constructions’ in Yup’ik Eskimo that can occur
either as noun phrases or as independent clauses, Woodbury says that: “When participle construc-
tions function as clauses [...] the participle suffixes act as mood markers. Rather than convert the
verb base to which they attach into adjectival nouns, they become part of their inflection as verbs.
[...] In addition to looking like mood markers, participle suffixes have mood meaning. They signal
vividness and sometimes exclamatory force in main clauses, forming a paradigm set with the other
main clause moods” (1985:76).
346                                 Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
pendent but is part of a larger complex sentence structure; for example if the marked
clause bears a specific function in a matrix clause (cf. Bickel 1999:3), or is overtly
marked as a clause of purpose or reason (etc.). This is not entirely satisfactory, but
is adequate for my basic descriptive purposes.
    It is of interest to note that the Duna use of the specificity marker on final
verbs in independent clauses shows some structural and functional similarity to
non-embedded nominalisations in several Tibeto-Burman language subgroups (for
example, Kiranti and Bodic), in which a morpheme that is used in nominalisa-
tion operations (and in some cases also functions as a singular definite article in
noun phrases) marks main clauses in attention-drawing, emphatic and/or ‘constat-
ive’ (“it’s a fact”) utterances.45 More generally, these ‘nominalisations’ are probably
examples of insubordination, the independent use of an apparently (or erstwhile)
subordinate structure (Evans 2007). Two functions of insubordination identified by
Evans that are of particular relevance to the Duna and Bodic examples are the ex-
pression of epistemic and evidential meanings, and the signalling of presupposed
material.","[373, 374, 375]"
"6.6     NP marking: grammatical relation and prominence
6.6.1    Contrasted subject (CS) marking
A subject NP (§4.2.1) can be formally marked as a ‘contrasted subject’ (CS). There
are two main situations in which it is necessary or appropriate to mark the subject
of a clause as contrasted. One is when there is a need to distinguish the subject NP
from other clausal participants. This situation typically arises in clauses headed by
multivalent predicates, the A argument (usually with an actor semantic role) being
overtly distinguished from other predicated arguments (P, R, T, see §4.2.1); this
use of contrasted subject marking functionally resembles ergative case marking.
Another such situation is when there is a need to distinguish an NP referent from
other referents, for example when the identity of the subject is new, unexpected,
and/or contrasted with the identity of another expected or potential subject; this
latter use resembles focus-marking.35
     Singular and dual personal pronouns have special contrasted subject forms, first
listed in §3.2.3 and reproduced here in Table 6.6. Other NPs are marked as contras-
ted with the postposed bound form -ka. 36
    In regard to the singular and dual pronouns, there is a regular relationship between
the non-CS and CS forms in that the final vowel o in the non-CS form changes to
  35
      Duna thus provides another example of a TNG language in which particular marking of an
NP matches ergative distribution to some extent, but cannot be adequately described on a syntactic
basis. See for example Renck (1975), Foley (1986), Scott (1986), Donohue and Donohue (1997),
Donohue (2005), Rumsey (MS), Priestley (2008). As is also fairly common in Papuan languages
(as elsewhere), the ergative-like marker in Duna is homophonous with a morpheme that marks an
instrument-like role.
   36
      I view contrasted subject marking as NP-internal as it can be expressed by stem alternation
rather than the application of a postposed clitic. However, the CS marker is not a kind of NP marker
as it does not attach directly to a spatial or Class I epistemic demonstratives, and commonly occurs
in combination with -na SPEC. In these two ways the CS marker resembles an NP postposition.

contour (§2.2.2). First and third person pronouns fluctuate as to whether contrasted
subject marking consists of a stem change only, or a stem change in combination
with the regular CS marker -ka. For example, in reference to a first person dual
contrasted subject the forms kena and kenaka are both used.37
    In its ‘actor-distinguishing’ capacity, CS-marking typically occurs on: subject
NPs of multivalent clauses with an animate or highly individuated object (one of
the features typically associated with high semantic transitivity, cf. Hopper and
Thompson (1980)); and on low animacy subjects of any multivalent predicate.
    Examples (409) - (414) show clauses headed by the verb sa- ‘hit, kill’, a Duna
primary transitive verb (Andrews 1985). In elicitation, CS-marking is judged to
be obligatory on the subject NP of this verb, as shown by the ungrammaticality of
(412) and (413). If no other NP occurs in a clause headed by sa-, an NP that is not
CS -marked will be interpreted as an object argument, as shown in (414).38 Overtly
marking the subject NP can thus be crucial to identifying a referent as A (an actor),
not P (an undergoer).(409)    noni-na-ka          ndulu iwani-na so.

     Marking through stem alternation only appears to be more common. In a sample of 29 CS-
marked first person dual pronouns in the textual data, there are nineteen tokens of kena and ten of
kenaka.
  38
     Note, however, that in the case of third person subjects, use of a dependent pronoun (§6.6.3)
may alternatively be sufficient to indicate subjecthood.

        * The snake killed a bird (CD)(414)   no so.
        1SG hit.PFV
        ‘[Someone] hit me.’ (CD)    With some bivalent predicates, for example the verb na- ‘eat, consume’, relative
animacy may be sufficient to identify the A participant, and CS-marking is typically
only used if the subject is low animacy (non-human). This is the same pattern as for
‘optional nominative case’ marking in Fore as analysed by Donohue and Donohue
(1997), following on from Scott’s description of the Fore ‘delineator’ morpheme
(Scott 1978 1986). The pattern is exemplified in (415) - (418). In (415) and (416),
the subject of the verbs na- ‘eat’ and sa- ‘take’ is highly animate (being first per-
son) and CS-marking is not used. These are typical ‘direct’ scenarios, in which
the roles of the participants can be correctly predicted from their relative animacy
(high/human = actor, low/non-human = undergoer).(415)   no ita na-ya-roko...

are low animacy (non-human), the scenarios are not direct, and CS-marking is re-
quired on the subject NP. Note, however, that it may not be strictly obligatory if the
identity of the A participant is already sufficiently established. In (419), only the
first iteration of the subject NP is CS-marked, as in the second iteration the identity
of the subject is assumed and does not need to be overtly contrasted.(417)   yawiputi-ka uru na-na.

         ‘If the dog eats the rat, the dog will eat chickens.’ (ED LSRV:99)    In clauses with monovalent predicates, CS-marking is less common than for sub-
jects of bivalent predicates, but is robustly attested in the textual data. CS-marking
in these cases typically indicates that the identity of the subject is new, unexpec-
ted, and/or contrasted with the identity of another expected or potential subject.
The subject is in ‘contrastive focus’ (Dik 1989). This again maps to functions of
the Fore nominative marker, which can also mark contrastive focus (Donohue and
Donohue 1997:85).
    In examples (420) and (421), the subject argument of nga- ‘go’ is marked with
-ka. Example (420) is taken from a point in a text just after the activities of a certain
dog have been descibed. The story now turns to the activities of another dog, which
is marked at first reference with -ka.39(420)    yawi-na-ka ndulu nga-ta...

         ‘One time another dog went...’(T/HY:201003i)    Example (421) is taken from a text in which a duck has just tried unsuccessfully
to retrieve a magic object that has been stolen. The duck’s companion (a cat) now
asserts that (?s)he will make a second attempt to get it back.(421)    na      ngui-na         ri-tia         ri-na.

         ‘Now I am going [he] said it is said’ (T/PK:080605ii)   Contrastive focus is also suggested by RA and KK’s assessment of suitable cir-
cumstances for the constructed sentence shown in (422), in which the subject ar-
gument of a monovalent complex predicate (§7.5.2) is CS-marked. RA and KK
thought that this sentence could occur as an answer to a father’s question to his
daughters, ‘Which one of you girls will marry?’.(422)    na      anoa nga-nda.
         1SG.CS man go-INT
         ‘I (out of all of us) will marry.’ (CD/XIV:113)    The major functions of CS-marking (identifying actors and marking contrast-
ive focus) are not mutually exclusive, and it is not always possible to distinguish
between them. For example in (423), the fact that the three dream women (ima
  39
    Note this dog is also marked as specific with -na despite being a new character, apparently
supplying contrastive identity implication; see discussion at various points in §6.3.

itupa) are CS-marked may indicate that they are contrasted both as new subject
referents, and as effective actors, because their actions have a direct (and adverse)
effect on a human entity, the speaker. In (424), a human subject of na- ‘eat’ is CS-
marked. This may be motivated by the fact that the object is as highly animate as
the subject, as well as contrastively focussing the subject and distinguishing it from
the other third person plural referent that has just been described.(423)    hindeke-roko, ima          itupa-ka hoa-ta         no sia         ho-yaki ra-ya,

         ‘Some men that had died earlier too, they [i.e., the women] had eaten [those

textual data) in which a subject NP is marked as contrasted. Both of these examples
describe the growth of cultivars, and are excerpts from stories in which the main
human character is incompetent at growing food and is helped in this task by a
supernatural creature who secretly plants crops for the human to harvest. In these
examples the use of contrasted subject marking perhaps highlights the fact that these
cultivars appear to grow ‘by themselves’ rather than being planted and tended by
humans in the usual way.40 The particular bananas and sweet potato runners referred
to in the story are special and contrast with ‘typical’ plants.(425)    hale     -ra-tia-ka     kete ndu loko rorane...

  40
     Interestingly, description of vegetable growth is also identified by Donohue and Donohue
(1997:78-9) as a situation in which the Fore nominative marker occurs on inanimate subjects of
monovalent clauses. However, Donohue and Donohue further argue that in the Fore case the relev-
ant predicating verbs are ambivalent, and that nominative marking makes explicit the fact the plants
are subjects of monovalent clauses, rather than objects of bivalent clauses. This does not exactly par-
allel the Duna case, as (from the currently available data) the predicating verbs in (425) and (426d)
only ever head monovalent clauses.

ations where a human subject argument is an involuntary experiencer rather than an
agent. For example, RA thought that using a CS pronoun with the monovalent verb
khou- ‘feel pain’ as in (427) was unusual and ‘not very sensible’. However, he sug-
gested that the sentence shown in (428) could be used by a sulky young person in
unrepentant sarcastic response to a parent who has been telling them off. Although
this ‘feels right’, I find it difficult to explicitly identify how the contrasted subject
marking contributes to the sarcastic or scornful nature of the sentence; perhaps it
asserts the speaker as someone who is ‘in control’ of the situation, even though the
semantics of the verb suggest otherwise.(427)   ? na      khou-yarua

     These ‘common sense’ definitions of speaker, addressee and other follow from a fairly proto-
typical utterance situation and do not precisely capture all circumstances in which we may be able
to identify speaker and addressee parties. For example, someone might appear to address one person
whilst intending that his or her utterance be heard and acted upon by someone else; see Goffman
(1974) and Levinson (1988) for detailed proposals of how speaker and addressee roles can be sys-
tematically decomposed into more narrowly defined roles to cope more explicitly with these kinds
of circumstances. Irvine (1996) asserts the relevance of this approach for analysing language, but
argues that it remains useful to maintain the maximally simple set of speech event participant roles
(speaker, addressee, other), and derive more subtle types through reference to the complex variety
of ways these are enacted, referenced, and evoked in a given speech situation.

          ‘They went to chop wood.’ (T/KK:090305)5.3.1.1    Special features of third person pronoun use
In regard to the difference between Duna nominal phrases consisting of a third
singular pronoun kho as opposed to those consisting of a common noun, Richard
Alo commented that, “As you are getting along with a story, kho will identify that
it is this man [...] kho will occur when you already know a particular person”.22
As Richard’s explanation indicates, third person pronouns (kho ‘3SG’, kheno ‘3DL’,
or khunu ‘3PL’) are in general used in reference to highly animate ‘others’ that
the speaker assumes are identifiable from context. Using a personal pronoun in a
sense raises this referenced participant to a level of animacy and identifiability that
is equivalent to that of speaker and addressee.
     Third person pronoun use is strongly associated with subject reference.23 In
ordinary circumstances, using a third person pronoun as an object NP is generally
considered odd or unacceptable, as illustrated by KK’s judgements of the pair of
constructed sentences shown in (204b). However, third person pronouns can be
used to highlight the fact that the identity of the object argument is unexpected and
pragmatically prominent. For example, PK said that the constructed sentence shown
in (205) would not be used normally, but would make sense in a situation in which
the speaker, intending to hit a certain person in a general skirmish, hit somebody
else by mistake.(204)     a. Keni-ka Melo-ne Justi-ne so.

                * Kenny hit the two of them (CD/VIII:111)
  22
       As recorded in XIV:127: ‘Yu wokim wanpela stori i go go nau, kho bai tok long dispela man
[...] kho em bai kam insait taim yu save pinis long wanpela particular person.’
    23
       For example, in looking at (free and encliticised) third person pronouns in three short texts,
30 out of 38 tokens occurred in subject NPs, five were in object NPs, and three were possessors.
Compare this to the 47 non-pronominal referring expressions in one of the texts, which included 16
subject NPs, 13 object NPs, and 18 obliques.

         1SG.CS 3SG strike.PFV
         ‘I hit him!’ (i.e., someone other than person I was intending to hit)
         (CD/VIII:41)    Third person pronouns can also be encliticised to a common noun NP, carrying
the same implications of animacy, topicality, and subjecthood (§6.6.3).
    The third person pronoun khunu has a further special area of use in denoting an
‘addressee group’. As seen in examples such as (200) and (202) previously, the pro-
noun inu is normally used in reference to more than two addressees, and the pronoun
khunu in reference to more than two others. However, there are a few occasions in
the data where khunu is used to denote a group of which the addressee is part.24
This use coincides with a situation in which the group referred to includes others
who are not present in the speech situation (as well as the ‘actual’ addressee(s) who
is/are there listening), and there is some increased degree of ‘distance’ (either lit-
eral or metaphorical) between the speaker and members of the addressee party. Two
examples are shown in (206) and (207). Example (206) shows a question asked of
two Duna people (KK and RA) about Duna people as a cultural group. In (207),
the speaker (KP) refers to the addressee (LSR) in conjunction with other members
of her (LSR’s) household, not present at the time the recording is made. LSR’s
household is ‘distant’ from KP in being composed entirely of Australian visitors
(also KP’s employers) in contrast to the other residents at Rewapi hamlet (KP’s
immediate kin, see §1.3.1).(206)    khunu watano          ndaka na-na=pe.

  24
    It is of relevance to note that syncretism of second and third non-singular markers (includ-
ing bound pronominal agreement forms) is common in highlands languages of New Guinea (Foley
1986:72-4, Suter 1997). Free pronouns in Huli, for example, distinguish between second and third
person in the singular but have single second/third person forms for dual and for plural (Rule 1974).

    A distinction between ‘close/present addressees’ (inu) and ‘distant/absent ad-
dressees’ (khunu) was also suggested in discussion with my Duna collaborators on
appropriate plural address terms. On one occasion when I asked about using either
inu or khunu in giving directives, KK and RA said these forms were basically inter-
changeable, but suggested that inu was more appropriate for giving commands to
a group of people that were nearby (see, for example, (200)), and khunu would be
used when shouting out a command over a distance (for example, from on top of a
hill). In talking over the two constructed questions shown in (208a) and (208b), PK
and KP initially said that they were ‘the same’, but added that (208a), in which inu
occurs, ‘includes everyone’, perhaps expressing a sense that inu maximally referred
to the present audience as an ‘in-group’, whereas khunu did not.(208)    a. inu-ka      karia-na=pe.

clude addressees relates to debate concerning the existence of a grammaticised
‘second person plural clusivity’ distinction. This refers to a theoretically possible
system whereby groups that are composed of actual addressees that are all present in
the speech situation (denoted by Cysouw (2003) as a ‘2+2’ group) would be referred
to in a different way to groups that consist of an actual addressee in combination
with others who are not present (a ‘2+3’ group). Whilst the existence of such a
system has been claimed for some languages (see, for example, Giridhar (1994) on
Mao Naga, Tibeto-Burman family), Cysouw (2003) and Simon (2005) argue that
these kinds of alternations do not really encode a grammaticised person distinction,
but have to do with extended uses of categories that belong to other domains in the
grammar, are tied to the expression of variables such as politeness and solidarity, or
have simply been described as a result of misinterpreted dialect variation.
    In the Duna case, there is currently too little information to contribute definit-
ively to this debate, as there are only a few examples of the pronoun khunu being
used in reference to addressees, and very few clear instances of reference being
made to ‘2+3’ groups in the textual data in any case.25 However, it seems likely
that Duna supports Simon’s (2005) findings that where a formal alternation maps to
  25
    Note also that Giles does not explicitly describe the Duna pronominal paradigm, and the few
examples of addressee group reference that I have found in her material are with the pronoun inu.
These all seem to be ‘2+2’ situations, as they are directives such as ‘Everybody sit down’, etc.

an inclusive/exclusive distinction within second person, this relationship is largely
epiphenomenal. The function of any such variation in Duna is probably anchored in
the expression of interpersonal meaning (that is, creating a distancing effect), rather
than the reification of a distinct person category. Further study of the uses of inu
and khunu in addressee reference is needed to to test this hypothesis and obtain a
clearer understanding of what is signified by this contrast.","[178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183]"

      I have also noted variant pronunciations of [p(j)ERO] ‘forehead’ in which the consonant is not
palatalised; this suggests a process of simplification as complex consonants are lost and merged with
simple stops.
   21
      While the idea is highly speculative at this stage, it may be productive to further consider the
presence of palatalised stop consonants in a diachronic context. For example, it is possible that cur-
rent word-initial unaspirated dento-alveolar stops are derived from erstwhile palatalised stops; these
have been retained as simplified plain stops with palatal lateral allophony, while earlier unaspirated
dento-alveolar stops merged with the alveolar tap word-initially (§2.1.2.2).

2.1.6   Notes on English and Tok Pisin loan words
Many vocabulary items in present-day Duna are transparently related to English
and/or Tok Pisin vocabulary.22 In this section I briefly outline some of the most
common ways in which these words are altered to fit the Duna phonemic invent-
ory and requirement for open syllables, referring to numbered loan word (LW) ex-
amples as listed in Table 2.36 (Duna terms shown in phonemic form). However, it
must be noted that pathways by which these terms entered into the Duna vocabu-
lary may be indirect and complex. For example, it is not unlikely that some terms
were first borrowed into neighbouring languages such as Huli, adapted to the Huli
sound system, and then passed on to Duna without direct transmission from the
‘original’ language. Further, in many cases it is unclear whether the Duna term is
derived from English or Tok Pisin, which itself imposes phonological changes on
English-derived lexical items. Additionally, the consonantal system of Tok Pisin
varies widely both historically and geographically, so it is not always clear exactly
what sounds were used by the people that introduced Tok Pisin-derived terms to
Duna speakers. Thus, I present here some typical correspondences rather than un-
equivocally Duna adaptative processses.
    Consonants of English or Tok Pisin correspond to what is perceived as the
closest match in the Duna system. Voiced stops correspond to Duna prenasalised
stops; see example words LW4-7. Voiceless fricatives correspond to voiceless as-
pirated stops word initially (LW1 and 2), and voiceless stops word-medially (LW9).
Word-initial alveolar liquids typically correspond to the alveolar lateral flap (LW11
and 12). A word-initial voiceless alveolar stop usually corresponds to an alveolar
flap (LW10). English voiceless alveo-palatal fricative or affricate consonants (in
non-initial position) correspond to voiceless dento-alveolar stop phonemes (LW9
and 13).
    Duna does not allow phonemic consonant clusters. Consonant clusters in for-
eign words are typically broken up by an intervening vowel (LW1 and 6), or sim-
plified to a single consonant (LW3 and 10). An exception to this is if the cluster
consists of a homorganic nasal + oral stop combination, in which case this can be
retained as a prenaslalised stop (LW3).
    Duna syllables are open, and consonantal codas do not occur. A final vowel is
added to words derived from foreign terms that end in a closed syllable. Typically
the added vowel is /i/ following a back consonant and /u/ following a non-back
consonant, as seen in LW4-11. However, there is also some variation between these
vowels and /a/ (LW4 and 5), and E is also sometimes used, as in LW3.

duced into Duna vocabulary for the description of novel items, for example rama anga ‘devil/spirit

2.2.1    Introduction
Hyman (adapting from Welmers 1959 and 1973) defines a language with tone as
“one in which an indication of pitch enters into the lexical realisation of at least
some morphemes” (2006:229). Lexical roots in Duna are realised with contrastive
pitch contours, and the language exhibits a word tone system in that “the word as a
whole is more important than the syllable as a domain for the assignment of tones”
(Donohue 1997:360). Contrastive tone melodies are contracted or stretched to fit as
many syllables as there are in the word.23
    My understanding of Duna tone is preliminary and I have not achieved a co-
herent analysis of Duna tone as a linguistic system (or indeed as a part of a group
of inter-related prosodic systems). This description is largely limited to outlining
the fundamental frequency (F0 ) signatures of four distinct pitch contours24 as theynut.pandanus’ for ‘corn’. Corn is now commonly termed kon anga in the Kopiago area.
   23
      Giles (MSb) describes the tone system of Duna as follows: “Duna is a tone language. Depending
on whether a word is uttered in a rising, falling, or level tone its meaning is altered. It appears that
syllables may have a mid, high, level, rising, or falling tone”. Whilst she clearly suggests in the
second sentence that the domain of contrastive tone is the word, she does not comment on how this
relates to the five proposed syllable tones. Her analysis of level, rising, and falling tonal contrast
largely concords with my own assessment.
   24
      As pointed out by Rose (1989), fundamental frequency (an acoustic property) does not directly
correspond to tonal pitch (a linguistic property), as “tonal pitch is the perceptual result of both
general auditory and speech specific processes [e.g., speaker and context normalisation] operating
on F0 ” (1989:61). Rose further demonstrates that some changes in F0 are intrinsic, that is, “not
deliberately produced, but occurring as the result of some other, deliberate gestures (F0 targets;
voiding on intervocalic consonants)” (1989:73). However, fundamental frequency is indicated as a
basic term in the function that relates acoustics to tonal pitch (Rose 1989:61, 78) and a description

occur on monomorphemic (non-verb) roots of up to three syllables, in citation form
(§2.2.2). In §2.2.3 I provide some discussion concerning the identification of under-
lying contrastive tone melodies that predict these pitch contours.","[82, 83, 84, 85]"
"5.4.2.3    Double personal pronouns
Examples (254) to (257) show clauses in in which one participant is referenced by
two adjacent personal pronouns. Doubling a pronoun emphasises the nature of the
referent as distinct and solitary. (I include an approximation of this emphasis in
parentheses in the translation lines.) There is no intonational evidence that the pro-
nouns are separate phrases. Example (258) shows a doubled inclusory pronominal
(§5.4.2.2).

ent adjacent pronouns, the second being marked with the exclusive morpheme -nga
(§6.6.2). In this case, one could argue that each pronoun is a separate NP, one
being the subject argument and one being the object argument. However, this inter-
pretation runs counter to the fact that the exclusive marker -nga can only sensibly
occur on the second pronoun in a double pronoun sequence, not the first pronoun, as
shown in (259b). This suggests that -nga is being applied to a single NP constituent
that is composed of two pronouns.(259)   a. no no-nga            so.

              I hit myself (CD)    Example (260) shows a reciprocal clause, for which it could also be argued that
the identical adjacent pronouns represent two distinct argument NPs. However I
find it most sensible and consistent to interpret khunu khunu as a single subject NP.
5.4. Participant reference with multiple NPs                                        165
The double pronoun construction emphatically identifies the participants as a dis-
tinct group, and contrasted subject marking with -ka (§6.6.1) further highlights the
fact that it is this group only who engaged in this activity. The fact that the contras-
ted subject marker occurs on the second rather than the first pronoun (that is, the
opposite of what would be expected from typical word order if these pronouns were
separate subject and object NPs) supports a ‘single NP constituent’ interpretation.(260)     khunu khunu-ka hara-tia.

Chapter 6NP, PP, and PlcP morphology
6.1     Introduction
This chapter describes bound forms that occur at the right edge of a referring expres-
sion; constituents of a phrase that are dependent markers rather than free lexemes.1
    The bound forms presented in §6.2 - §6.5 are grouped according to a combina-
tion of semantic, distributional, and functional properties into four types: epistemic
demonstratives, NP markers, PlcP markers, and postpositions. The general order
of application of these markers is shown in Figure 6.1, with ‘L’ standing for ‘last
potentially free-standing lexeme of the phrase’ (a nominal, adjective, quantifier,
demonstrative, or interrogative root).2
           ——————————————————————————-
                               (                         )

           ——————————————————————————-
                     Figure 6.1 Order of co-occurring phrase-final morphemes
    Epistemic markers can be included in a phrase to indicate features concern-
ing speaker and hearer knowledge of the referent (§6.2). These markers occupy a
roughly equivalent position in the referring expression to a demonstrative (§5.2.4),
and can (and in some cases must) be followed by an NP or PlcP marker. These
forms also occur mark epistemic assessment on final predicates, where they take
scope over a proposition rather than an entity.
   1
      Note that, although all of the bound morphemes described in this chapter are postpositional in
that they are placed after the lexical constituents of a phrase, I reserve the label ‘postposition’ (P) for
the forms described in §6.5 only.
    2
      This representation does not provide a minimal or exhaustive template, and does not address
the complex co-occurrence restrictions and dependency relationships that exist between individual
forms. Rather, it is intended to indicate that if more than one type of marker is present in a single
referring expression, this is the way they will be arranged.","[192, 193, 194, 195]"
"
Numbers derived as ordinal nouns  Applying -ne to a numerical quantifier (§3.6.1)
derives an ordinal noun.3 An example is shown in (114).
   2
      See also Haley (2002:123) and Gillespie (2007b:145-6) concerning more elaborate address or
referential terms that relate to parish membership.
    3
      An ordinal marker -ne ∼ -ni is also suffixed to numbers in Huli (Cheetham 1978).

(114)    yapa-ne ha-na.
         two-ORD there-SPEC
         ‘The second is that one.’ (LIV/PK:080605i)   The special quantifier ndu ‘one’ (§3.6.3) does not derive an ordinal noun when
marked with -ne.4 This construction derives a noun that means (roughly) ‘thing’, as
shown in (115).(115)    ndu-ne      mangene kone         ndu

         ‘a very important thing’ (T/JS:KG05V5.40)
Adjectives and -ne   The current data includes only a few examples of -ne occurring
on adjectival roots. Example (116) shows the adjective kete ‘small’ in combination
with -ne. The derived form ketene is the only constituent of a possessor-referent NP.
In this example ketene functions more like a noun than an adjective, as adjectives
do not typically occur as the final constituent in an NP, but are usually followed by
another word or a bound form such as an NP marker (§5.2.2).(116)    kete-ne       ramene-na
         small-TYPE group-SPEC
         ‘the group of little bits’(T/PP:250903)    In example (117) (taken from a text by one of the oldest contributing speakers),
ketene occurs following a noun. This is a position that can be occupied by adjectives
(§5.2.2), suggesting that -ne is not functioning as a nominaliser in this example.5(117)    nane kete-ne         roka roka
         boy small-TYPE many many
         ‘many many little boys’ (T/RS:221203ii)   It is also plausible that ketene occurs in (117) as a nominal specifier (§5.2.1.5)
specifying a particular kind of nane.6
   4
      An ordinal noun meaning ‘the first’ is perhaps derivable from the number mbitu ‘one’, but I
have not tested this.
    5
      This example may illustrate a relationship between the nominalising -ne and the homophonous
pairing marker that occurs on nominals: an earlier generic marker -ne can be posited meaning some-
thing like ‘items of like kind’ that has split into distinct nominalising and pairing functions. It is
also noticeable that several kin-terms and human-referent nouns include the sequence /nE/ as a final
syllable, suggesting thay these terms may derive from complex words that specified related kinds of
people (consider, for example, imane ‘girl, young woman’ and ima ‘woman’).
    6
      Note that nane is an appropriate term for a wide age group, and can be used to refer to adult
(typically unmarried) men as well as male children or adolescents.
5.2. Constituents of noun NPs                                                                          131
Nominals derived from verbs       Marking a verbal root with the suffixal form -nane
derives a noun. I assume that this suffixal form is complex, composed of the habitual
verbal inflection -na (§8.2.3.2) followed by -ne.7 As explained by Giles (MSa:L31),
the resulting expression describes an item that is “for the purpose of” the verb (or
complex predicate). Examples are shown in (118) and (119).(118)     ka       na-na-ne          peli ndu sa-ta         si    heya          neya.

In this section I describe two operations which are similar to a compounding oper-
ation (§5.2.1.3) in that a morpheme with denotative meaning is added to a lexical
root to form a noun. However, the second morpheme in the construction is not itself
a free form (although in one case it is transparently related to a free form).","[158, 159, 160]"

An introduction to Duna grammar             Lila San Roque
    A thesis submitted for the degree of
           Doctor of Philosophy
   of The Australian National University
             September 2008
This work contains no material which has been accepted for the award of any other
degree or diploma in any university or other tertiary institution and, to the best of
my knowledge and belief, contains no material previously published or written by
another person, except where due reference has been made in the text.
Abstract
This thesis is an introduction to Duna, a language spoken by approximately 25,000
people living in Southern Highlands Province in Papua New Guinea. Duna (also
known as Yuna) is classified as a member of the Duna-Bogaya subgroup of the Trans
New Guinea family. This study is primarily based on work with Duna speakers of
the Lake Kopiago region.
     The thesis provides a basic treatment of phonology, describes the structure of
simple sentences, and examines in detail the expression of epistemic assessment
(the treatment of a proposition as representing knowledge), a semantic domain that
is richly encoded by bound morphemes in the language.
     Chapter 1 gives background information concerning the Duna lands, people,
and language situation. It also describes previous work that has been done on the
language, and the nature and sources of the data used in this study.
     Chapter 2 includes an overview of Duna segmental phonology and gives an
account of citation tone contrasts in monomorphemic words.
     Chapter 3 outlines Duna word classes, including large open lexical classes such
as nouns, and smaller closed grammatical classes such as demonstratives.
     Chapter 4 deals with the structure of the basic clause, describing the different
clause types and outlining dominant and pragmatically marked word orders.
     Nouns and NP structure are treated in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 details NP marking
that encodes epistemic positioning, specificity, pairhood, grouphood, semantic role,
grammatical relation, and discourse or pragmatic prominence.
     Chapter 7 analyses complex predicates, for example, those that are composed
of a verb and a verb adjunct, or of several verbs in series.
     The remainder of the thesis focusses on bound morphemes that are added to
the predicate of a final clause. Chapter 8 treats markers which specify features
of the denoted situation in terms of time or event modality. Chapters 9 and 10
describe evidential markers, information status markers, and epistemic particles,
morphemes which attach to a final predicate to express an epistemic assessment of
the proposition.
     Chapter 11 describes the formal and functional features of Duna sentence types
and discusses typical implications that certain predicate markers have concerning a
speaker’s or addressee’s relationship to the denoted situation.

Acknowledgements
Many Duna people in the Lake Kopiago area and in Mount Hagen (Western High-
lands Province) have contributed language material and discussion to this work. I
thank them wholeheartedly for their essential part in this study, as well as their ex-
cellent company. Kenny Kendoli, Petros Kilapa, Kipu Piero and Richard Alo in
particular translated and discussed their language with humour, patience, tenacity,
thoughtfulness, and insight. Richard, you were taken from us too soon, and I con-
tinue to honour your great courage, intelligence, and compassion.
    Whilst at Lake Kopiago I was very lucky to be able to record texts from the late
Sane Noma and Raki Patako, and from Pastor Hagini Yami, three senior Duna men
of extraordinary wisdom and spirit. Special thanks also to Kipu, Metai Heri, Haya
Suku, Monica Kenny and Metina Kali for the hard work they put into conversing
with a learner of their language.
    In the field I was based at an ANU research house in Rewapi (Hirane parish),
next door to Kenny and Kipu and their family members. Many thanks to them
for putting up with the extra disruption and responsibilities that this entailed, and
to other members of the Rewapi/Hirane and wider Lake Kopiago community who
were so welcoming and kind. I hope to find some way to repay you.
    In writing this thesis I have been privileged to be under the tutelage of my su-
pervisors Andrew Pawley and Alan Rumsey of the Research School of Pacific and
Asian Studies. Andy whipped the bulk of my early chapter drafts into shape, and de-
voted much time and effort to his careful reading of a near-final draft of the thesis.
His stringent and perspicuous advice has been of immense value to me at every
stage of the writing process. Alan Rumsey has conscientiously read even my most
off-the-rail writings, and consistently offered wise and sensitive feedback. He has
helped me to battle with some difficult organisational problems, and been encour-
aging and engaged throughout.
    My advisor Malcolm Ross contributed significantly to a reworking of Chapters
1-7 with his thoughtful, precise, and clear-sighted comments. Nicholas Evans got
stuck into Chapters 8-11 with enthusiasm and incisiveness. I enjoyed our discus-
sions and arguments very much, and they were very important in helping me revise
the thesis.
    I began my studies at the ANU in 2003 as a member of an interdisciplinary
project ‘Chanted Tales from Highland New Guinea’ (funded by the Australian Re-
search Council), of which Alan Rumsey was the lead Chief Investigator. Being
a member of this project provided me with some additional funds for fieldwork
and translation, and gave me the opportunity to take part in some very stimulat-
ing workshops and collaborations. Thanks to Alan and also to Don Niles (Partner                                         iii

Investigator on the project) for all their hard work in this regard.
    The anthropologist Nicole Haley has been working with Duna people since
1994, and was a postdoctoral fellow on the Chanted Tales project. She was in-
strumental in making this language study happen, and I have benefited greatly from
her experience and hard work. Nicole organised the establishment of the ANU re-
search base at Rewapi, introduced me to the people who were pivotal to my study
of Duna, and facilitated Kenny Kendoli and Richard Alo’s trips from PNG to Can-
berra. I was able to use some recordings that Nicole made in 2003 as part of my
data set, and am grateful for this important contribution to my work.
    The ethnomusicologist Kirsty Gillespie also joined the Chanted Tales project
in 2003, and was awarded her doctorate this year for her research into creativity
and change in Duna song. She has been an inspiring colleague and a warm and
supportive friend. Kirsty made a number of excellent recordings of spoken Duna
texts in 2005 (listed in Appendix 1) and made these available for my use. These
have greatly added to the richness and quality of data I had available for analysis,
and include some of my favourite stories. There are also several language structures
and subtleties that I would have missed entirely were it not for Kirsty’s study of song
texts while we were in the field. It was great to work together and I look forward to
doing so again.
    I am grateful to my fellow students in the linguistics department at RSPAS, in
particular Carol Priestley and Antoinette Schapper, for their reading recommenda-
tions, problem-solving suggestions, thought-provoking discussions, and comrade-
ship. I only hope I can be half as enlivening and encouraging in Antoinette’s final
thesis months as she has been in mine. Extra thanks also to Bevan Barrett for always
answering my sudden random questions with poise and acuity, and to Susan Love
and Doug Marmion for their technical help.
    Many other scholars contributed to my research through their advice, discussion,
and encouragement at various times during my candidature. I am indebted to Alex-
andra Aikhenvald, Avery Andrews, Chris Ballard, Tom Ernst, Glenda Giles, Rachel
Hendery, Darja Hoenigman, Pascale Jacq, Gabriel Lomas, Elizabeth Minchin, Nick
Modjeska, Don Niles, Stephen Pattemore, Hans Reithofer, Bambi Schieffelin and
Dan Seeland. Discussing issues of evidentiality with Robyn Loughnane was es-
pecially stimulating and helpful for me, and I thank her for her insights and sug-
gestions. The attendees at the Monday morning Research Roundtable meetings at
ANU helped to get me through some dark thesis days.
    I am indebted to Kevin Murphy, Esther Fasnacht, and Esther’s late husband
Pierre, for their kindness and openheartedness in looking after me while I was in
Mt. Hagen, sending treats to the field, and taking care of my family members who
were able to visit. Kevin’s generosity in sharing his home made it possible for me
to stay and work in Hagen for an extended period when access to Lake Kopiago
was difficult, and I don’t know what I would have done without him. Pierre gave so
much in his life, and I am lucky to have known him and his family. Thanks also to
the other pilots, ground crew and office staff of the Missionary Aviation Fellowship,
and the staff at the Mt Hagen Missionary Home. These dedicated and hard-working
people solved a lot of problems for me, not to mention keeping me cheerful. Like
so many other PNG researchers, I also thank Jim Robins of the National Research
Institute in Port Moresby.

     My interest in New Guinea languages was sparked and developed by two caring,
energetic, and inspiring teachers, Bill Foley and Mark Donohue. I am profoundly
grateful to Bill and Mark for fostering the will and providing the opportunity for my
first trip to Papua New Guinea in 2000, which I undertook with Mark and another
great companion, Melissa Crowther. It was also around this time that I met Miriam
Corris, who has been a leading light for me throughout the writing of this thesis.
Warm thanks to Mim for her understanding and encouragement, and also for the
generosity and patience of her and her partner Phil Hayman in helping me with
formatting.
     My dear friends Anna Lockwood and Jessica Kemp were resident in Hewa and
Bogaia communities, neighbouring Duna country, on my first field trip in 2003-4.
Heartfelt thanks to both of them for all their stalwart and loving support, not to
mention providing me with a home at various times. Other people whom I wish to
thank for especially helping to make Canberra home and for urging me on with this
thesis are Matilda Thomas, Steph Garling, Yuri Cath, Ben Jeffares, Brett Calcott,
James Berrell, Maggie and Sweep, and my indomitable grandmother Ma’adi Miller.
     My family have been extremely supportive throughout my doctoral research,
as ever. My parents Craig and Georgina and sister Mehera undoubtedly planted
the seeds that gave me the confidence and curiosity to begin language study in
an unfamiliar country. Thanks also to their respective partners Jude Prichard, John
Diamond and Tim Edmond, and to my brother Matthew Hall and sister-in-law Anita
Bulan. Having my mum and John visit in the field was a wonderful experience, and I
am so glad they could come. Finally, there is my husband Chris Haskett, a powerful
sustaining force in my life since we met in 2004. Thank you, darling, for sticking
with me and keeping me going through this foolhardy project.

Other glossing conventionsIn example sentences I use a hyphen (-) to represent ligature between two morphemes where
(at least one) of the morphemes does not occur as a freestanding form. I use the equals sign
(=) to represent ligature for: bound morphemes that attach to the final predicate, but do not
occur in a primary inflectional capacity (§8.1.1.1), that is, epistemic particles (§10.4) and
the sentence-final markers =nia ASSERT and =pe ‘Q’ (§11.1); and dependent third person
pronouns (§6.6.3). I do not use ‘-’ versus ‘=’ to represent an overall distinction between
affixes and a clitics. A large number of the bound forms that I describe in this thesis are
arguably clitics on the basis of their distributional flexibility. However, a more developed
understanding of Duna phonology is necessary to explore the validity and applicability of
a clear clitic/affix distinction, and I use ‘=’ for morphemes which are anomalous in other
ways.
     Where a single Duna morpheme requires glossing with more than one English word,
these are separated by a full stop. In certain cases where a given morpheme encodes more
than one category or meaning I use a forward slash (/) to separate these two meanings.
     Words in example sentences that are clearly related to Tok Pisin and/or English words
are annotated ‘lw’ (for ‘loan word’) in the gloss. Some of the examples in this thesis in-
clude Duna words that belong to a “special esoteric vocabulary” (Haley 2002:132) called
kẽyaka. Kẽyaka terms are used extensively in song, but are not typically used in everyday
conversation or spoken narratives. Kẽyaka terms are indicated in example sentence glosses
with ‘k.’ preceding the approximate import of the word.
     In Chapters 9 to 11 approximations of perception events that are entailed by evidential
markers (§9.2) are shown in curly brackets in the English translation.
Chapter 1Introduction
1.1     The Duna community
1.1.1    Duna lands and people
Introduction    The Duna language is spoken by approximately 25,000 people liv-
ing in the north-west corner of Southern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea
(Figure 1.1).1 The word ‘Duna’ refers to both a language and a people. This term
(derived from a Huli designation, see §1.1.2) was adopted by the Australian admin-
istration and is now conventionally accepted as standard reference in English and
Tok Pisin; see Haley (2002:14). The indigenous self-designating term is Yuna. The
language is classified as a member of the Duna-Bogaya subgroup of the Trans New
Guinea family (Wurm 1975; Ross 2005a).2
    Duna lands extend from the headwaters of the Pori and Tumbudu Rivers in
the south-east, through the river valleys to the Strickland River in the north-west
(Figure 1.2), and lie within the Koroba-Lake Kopiago district of the province. The
information that I provide in this section predominantly applies to the north-western
Duna region (§1.2.1), particularly the Lake Kopiago area. This is where several
researchers who have contributed significantly to the available literature on Duna
were based, and is also where I conducted my own fieldwork (§1.3.1).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"

          ‘I am cold.’ (CD/III:71)    Note that in (50), the single argument of this monovalent clause, Yuna anoa
‘Duna men’, is marked with the contrasted subject marker -ka (§6.6.1). KK judged
that his would be unacceptable in a clause headed by a non-verbal adjectival predic-
ate (i.e., one that is not marked with inflectional morphology, see §4.1.1), as shown
in (52). (52) * anoa ha-na-ka            paya kone
            man there-SPEC-CS good INTENS
          That man is very good (CD/XV:6)4.1.3     Bivalent clauses
Bivalent clauses are headed by a predicate that semantically requires two parti-
cipants. For example the bivalent verb sa- ‘strike, hit, kill’ subcategorises for a
striker and a thing that is struck. The verb encodes an activity that includes an
agent, “a participant which the meaning of the verb describes as doing something,
or causing something to happen” and a patient, “a participant which the verb de-
scribes as having something happen to it, and as being affected by what happens to
it” (Andrews 2007:137). I refer to items that fill the participant slots of a bivalent
clause as ‘A’ and ‘P’ arguments. Typically an A argument has agent-like semantics
and a P argument has patient-like semantics, but this is not always the case. For
example, the verb may specify other kinds of semantic roles such as the theme and
path required by the verb mbite-, ‘cross (a waterway)’; or a bivalent verb may be
used in expressing an involuntary experience in which the A argument is an experi-
encer and the P argument a stimulus (§7.6).
   An A argument can be realised in the clause as an NP, or through zero ana-
phora (§4.2.3.3). An A argument NP is typically either obligatorily marked as a
‘contrasted subject’, or eligible for contrasted subject marking if certain pragmatic
conditions exist (§6.6.1). The identity of an A argument restricts or predicts the
4.1. Clause types                                                                                103
range of bound morphemes that can be applied to the predicate (§11.2). Unlike P
arguments, third person A arguments may typically be referenced by an NP that in-
cludes a free or dependent personal pronoun without any implication of pragmatic
prominence (see sections 5.3.1.1 and 6.6.3).
    A P argument can be realised as an unmarked NP (that is, one that is not overtly
marked for semantic role, grammatical relation, or prominence, see Chapter 6),
an NP marked with -ta ‘LOC’ (§6.3.4.2), or have zero anaphoric reference. A P
argument NP is never marked as a contrasted subject, and its identity does not have
direct bearing on predicate morphology.
    Three examples of bivalent verbal clauses are shown in (53) - (55). In each
case the P argument is realised as an unmarked NP. The A arguments are realised
as either an unmarked NP (example (53)) or an NP that is marked as a contrasted
subject (examples (54) and (55)). In each example the A argument NP precedes the
P argument NP, and this exemplifies typical word order (§4.2.2). (53)    ko ita-na        no-rane...

5.3.1   Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns by nature usually have referents that are highly individuated and
unique. They are typically unmodified, occurring as the only lexical constituent
of an NP (although see also §5.4.2.2 and §5.4.2.3 concerning the occurrence of
personal pronouns in complex nominal phrases, and §6.6.3 concerning third person
pronouns that are encliticised to a common noun or proper name NP). Examples
(188) - (190) show nominal phrases that consist of a singular personal pronoun. The
first person form no is used in reference to a single speaker (roughly, the person who
is talking), the second person form ko in reference to a single addressee (roughly,
5.3. Personal pronoun, PN, and interrogative NPs                                               149
the person the speaker is talking to) and the third person form kho in reference to a
single ‘other’, someone who is neither speaker nor addressee.21 Special reference
properties of third person pronouns are discussed in more detail in §5.3.1.1.(188)    ...no waki-u.

animates, for example, magic animals). Examples that illustrate the pronoun keno
‘1DL’ are shown in (191) and (192). In (191), keno is ‘inclusive’, used in reference
to a pair composed of the speaker and the addressee. In (192) it is used in ‘exclusive’
reference, denoting a pair composed of an the speaker and an ‘other’.(191)    keno ngoae.

ample (195) the third person dual kheno.","[175, 176, 177, 178]"
"Enclosure marker -nda      The suffix -nda (ENCL) occurs on nominals and demon-
stratives to form a noun that denotes an enclosure or shelter.8 This morpheme is
transparently related to the common noun anda ‘house, home, dwelling’; see fur-
ther remarks at the close of this section.
    Some examples of ‘enclosure’ nouns are: khananda ‘cave’ from khana ‘stone’;
hinanda ‘men’s house’ from hina ‘sweet potato’ (presumably because men would
traditionally eat together separately from women); palenda ‘bachelor cult enclos-
ure’ from palena (a sacred plant of the bachelor cult); and sikinda ‘hospital’ from
siki ‘sickness’ (<Tok Pisin/English).9
    The enclosure marker -nda is commonly suffixed to social grouping names
(§3.2.2.3), for example, in Mbaranda from the parish name Mbara. The derived
term refers specifically to a (literally or notionally) enclosed locus of domestic set-
tlement belonging to the parish, making it clear that it is a place rather than a people
or language that is being referred to.
   7
      However, this may be a fossilised rather than productive composition. In some instances the
first vowel of -na is reduced, being realised as [E] or [@], and this is not a usual feature of the habitual
morpheme.
    8
      Where the final syllable of the root word starts with an alveolar nasal, this syllable is com-
monly deleted upon the addition of the enclosure marker, i.e., the word undergoes haplology. For
example Hirane (a parish name) in combination with -anda is usually Hiranda (‘Hirane enclosure’)
not Hiranenda.
    9
      Compare the Tok Pisin term for hospital, ‘haus sik’ (‘haus’ = ‘building, house’, ‘sik’ = ‘sick-
ness’).
132                                           Chapter 5. Constituents of nominal phrases
   The enclosure marker occurs productively with demonstrative roots as well as
nominals. An example is shown in (120).(120)    hata        inu   roma-nda u.
         yesterday 1/2PL above-ENCL sleep.PFV
         ‘Yesterday we slept at the upper dwelling.’ (T/HK:250903)    As mentioned previously, the enclosure marker is related to the noun anda
‘house’, and in some cases there is variation or ambiguity as to whether a phrase
represents a derived ‘enclosure’ term or a possessive construction in which the first
noun refers to the ‘owner’ of a house. For example, in describing a ‘mourning
house’ (a place where people gather to mark a recent death, typically in company
with the corpse, see Gillespie (2007b:Chapter 4)) it is possible to use a possessive
construction khene anda (‘house of death/corpse’) composed of two nouns khene
‘death/corpse’ and anda ‘house’, or a derived term, khene-nda (death-ENCL). Note
however that derived forms behave differently to NP phrases headed by the free
form anda with respect to how they combine with NP markers. A nominal phrase
that is headed by anda ‘house’ is marked as locative with -ta (§6.3.4.2) when it de-
notes a goal or location (see, for example, 319), whereas terms derived with -nda
‘ENCL’ typically occur as unmarked obliques (§6.4.4.4).","[160, 161]"

          ‘The Phawa [mountain] above smiled...’(T/HY:201003iii)     In telling a narrative, sopa ‘below’ can denote an earlier point in the story; events
or things that have already been described are ‘lower’ than the current topic. Thus,
if a speaker has to back-track to an earlier point in a narrative (for example, if they
have forgotten to include an important part of the plot), they will introduce this by
saying they ‘forgot something below’ or similar; see for example (787) in §9.2.5.2.17
The term eto is used in denoting successive time periods. For example, the week
(sarere, from Tok Pisin) following the current week (‘next week’) is referred to as
sarere eto.185.2.5    Co-occurring adjectives, quantifiers, and demonstratives
Adjectives, quantifiers and demonstratives can co-occur in one NP, as represented
in Figure 5.1. More specifically, it is common for adjective NP constituents to be
followed by quantifiers or demonstratives, but unusual for quantifiers and demon-
stratives to occur together.
    Examples (166) and (167) show nominal phrases in which a quantifier follows
an adjective.19
  17
      There is some evidence that roma is conversely used in anticipation of new things to come. For
example the conventional phrase roma ai ‘above who?’ that is used at the beginning of text/melody
blocks in sung pikono typically occurs at the introduction of new characters, whereas sopa ai ‘below
who?’ is used when returning to the activities of old characters who are already known. However
I have not examined whether this correlation holds true in all cases. The pairing of ‘below’ and
‘earlier’ may relate to the fact that in typical traditional stories the hero starts in a low altitude area
and travels into a high altitude area (see Kendoli forthcoming). This may in turn reflect larger themes
in Duna cosmology, as human life itself is described as having begun in the lowlands and moved up
into the higher country (see Haley 2002).
   18
      There is some evidence that eto is also used for linking/temporal ordering in descriptions of
successive events, that is, with a roughly equivalent function to ‘then’ or ‘next’ in English sentences
such as ‘He went to the house, then/next he called his sister’.
   19
      Note that in the case of (167), the meaning of the sentence discourages an interpretation of the
adjective as being part of a smaller unit with the noun that is then modified by the quantifer. That is,
the sentence does not appear to mean ‘eat [many [big choko runners]]’.

               (CD/2003)    Example (169) shows an adjective and demonstrative in an NP with no overt
notional head. The identity of the referent is clear from the interactional setting, in
which the speaker has just swiped at a mosquito.(169)   [kete ha-na-ka]          na-nda ruwa-ta...

phrase kete ndu is modifying the verbal predicate, and does not refer to an entity. It
is an adverbial phrase, not an NP.(170)   hale-ra-tia-ka           kete ndu loko ro-rane          ho-ra-tia       nei-yaka-o

        ‘The bananas ripened a little and she ate these.’ (P/PP:KG05V2.15)    Quantifiers and demonstratives very rarely occur in the same NP.20 The sentence
shown in (171) is the only example I have found in the textual data where the quan-
tifer ndu occurs in combination with a locational demonstrative. In this example
ndu has numerical rather than indefinite meaning.
  20
    Note also that, as outlined in §6.2.1, the occurrence of ndu in combination with epistemic
demonstratives forms a complex epistemic demonstrative, rather than constituting a [Q Dem] se-
quence.

A noun NP can include a phrasal constituent that denotes a possessor-like entity
(XPposs ). This may be a nominal phrase or a postpositional phrase formed with
the NP postposition -ya ‘BEN’ (§6.5.4). The nature of the ‘possessive’ relationship
may differ somewhat according to the animacy and individuation of the possessor.
The positioning of a possessor NP before the possessed item is a typical word order
pattern in verb-final languages (Dryer 2007b).","[173, 174, 175]"
"6.6.3   Dependent third person pronouns
Proper name or common noun nominal phrases that denote third person parties can
include a postposed coreferent third person pronoun, as in (436). Typically a third

person pronoun that occurs in this position is encliticised, that is, it shows some level
of phonological dependency. It may be very short and fit into the intonation contour
of the nominal phrase rather than sounding like a separate word, and there may
also be loss of segmental content. For example, I have heard third person singular
pronouns in this position realised as nothing more than a brief phrase-final [O]. I
refer to a pronoun that occurs in this position, with no pause intervening between it
and the otherwise final NP constituent, as a dependent pronoun, and represent such
forms with a preceding ‘=’ in example sentences.41(436)    no ame-tia         =khunu ha-me           wa-ya ka-na.

         ‘My ancestors would live doing thus.’ (T/RS:270405a)    Free third person pronouns typically reference participants that are animate, def-
inite, and discourse prominent, and are associated with the grammatical relation
subject (§5.3.1.1). This is also true of the use of dependent pronominal forms.42 De-
pendent pronouns occur frequently in subject NPs, but the inclusion of a dependent
pronoun in an object or oblique NP is unusual and indicates pragmatic prominence.
    The importance of current discourse prominence to dependent pronoun use is
illustrated in the contrast between the referential treatment of the two human par-
ticipants Layapi and Wakili in lines (437d) and (438b) of text excerpts (437) and
(438), respectively. In both of these excerpts the speaker (KK) describes a roughly
similar sequence of events, the death of a person and the happenings that surround
this.
    Excerpt (437) is taken from towards the end of a narrative which describes an
attack on an old man named Layapi by a mysterious supernatural force. At (437a),
Layapi is a participant with high topic continuity and is covertly referenced through
zero anaphora. However, from (437b) onwards Layapi starts to ‘drop out’ of the
text. When we get to (437d), in which Layapi’s death is described, Layapi is no
  41
      In cases where a non-prononimal NP and a third person pronoun are coreferential and contigu-
ous but there is a pause or clear intonation discontinuity between the two constituents, I analyse
these as separate NPs, not a dependent pronoun construction. Such an example may alternatively be:
a left dislocation construction, §4.2.4.3; an ‘umbrella’ pronoun that follows a listing construction,
see §5.4.1; or two adpositional NPs that occur at points of disjuncture, periphrastic expansion, or
repetition, for example when a speaker hesisates mid-clause and then repeats or corrects themselves.
However, it must be added that as my judgment of whether or not discontinuous intonation is present
is subjective, the decision between whether a ‘NP Pronoun’ string counts as left dislocation or a de-
pendent pronoun construction is somewhat arbitrary. I do not regard this as highly problematic in
my description as the functions of the two constructions are highly compatible, and I further believe
that ambiguity between them reflects a genuinely continuous relationship between the construction
types.
   42
      An examination of 47 third person pronouns as they occurred in three short texts suggested that
free and dependent pronouns occur with roughly equal frequency in narrative material; there were
23 free pronouns and 24 dependent forms.

     From discussion with KK it does not appear that this single-verb clause includes an identifiable
‘participant’ as such, but is more of a narrator’s comment external to the story. The subject argument
is in a sense the situation that KK has just described.

and discourse prominent participants, the use of dependent pronouns can bear the
burden of ‘subject identification’ to some extent.44 Example (439) shows a clause
with high semantic transitivity in which the object and subject arguments are equally
animate. The subject argument is referenced with an NP that includes a dependent
pronoun. This example shows a situation in which CS-marking of the A argument
NP would be preferred (if not obligatory) in less contextualised utterances (for ex-
ample, constructed sentences or ‘bare’ elicited data for which context has not been
imaginatively developed or imported from a real-life situation).(439)    e    anene =kheno ho-na           neya ka-ya           ra-na.

         (T/YS:KG05V7.22)    Example (440) shows a textual excerpt in which the third person subject of
ngua- ‘give’ is referenced by an NP that includes an unmarked dependent pronoun;
in bare elication contexts, subject NPs in clauses headed by this verb were consist-
ently CS-marked.(440)    nane-na =kho imanoa -ra-tia            hatia kondarake ngi-ya...

         ‘The boy gave these people the road contract...’ (T/PK:080605ii)    The association of dependent pronouns with the subject argument of a clause is
further illustrated by the constructed examples shown in (441) and (442). Example
(441) shows an acceptable sentence, in which the subject NP, Kenika is CS-marked
and the object NP, Melone Jetine, is unmarked. Example (442) shows the same
sentence with the dual third person pronoun kheno included as a dependent form in
the object NP; KK rejected this as nonsensical.","[240, 241, 242, 243]"

Interrogatives in Duna that do not contain an interrogative pro-form are commonly
structured as ‘alternative’ interrogatives which “provide a list from which, the speaker
suggests, the right answer might be drawn” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:179). Two
(or more) alternative scenarios are presented in the sentence. =Pe indicates there
is a choice to be made between these scenarios, and is felicitously represented in
English translation as ‘or’. Examples (1030) - (1032) show interrogatives in which
two alternatives of differing polarity are suggested. In (1030) - (1032) the positive
iteration of the predicate is placed first, inflected and further marked with =pe. The
negative iteration that follows is derived with the negative circumfix na- -ya (§8.3),
and is not marked with =pe. This is typical of ‘alternative polarity’ interrogatives
in Duna (see also Giles MSa:L5). An appropriate answer (as shown in the b lines
of (1031) and (1032)) usually repeats part of the original question.

functionally akin to ‘yes/no questions’ in that they ask, is something the case? How-
ever, the scenario of this something not being the case is made lexically explicit in
the utterance; these examples are thus similar to ‘disjunctive-negative’ structures
(König and Siemund 2007:297) that occur in languages such as Mandarin.
    Examples (1033) - (1035) show some further alternative interrogatives. These
do not offer two alternatives of differing polarity, but detail possible propositions
that ‘sketch’ (either more or less exhaustively) the semantic domain of the required
information. Answers are shown in the ‘b’ lines.(1033)    a. kei=pe,              ngoya?

tions. The form =pe is repeated as a semi-independent form in between the altern-
atives, functioning like a coordinating conjunction. This repeated semi-independent
use of =pe is common if the alternatives are contrasted but not really ‘parallel’ pro-
positions (that is, they differ according to several parameters, as in (1036)), or if
more than two alternatives are listed. See also (603) in §7.5.5.2.(1036)     oke, imanoa mbatia or say Kristian mbatia-ka, ha-me-ka                  ka

Interrogatives may alternatively be ‘question word’ interrogatives (Payne 1997) that
contain an interrogative pro-form (§3.9). The pro-form stands for information that is
missing from the speaker’s knowledge of the proposition, and which the addressee
is asked to supply (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:185). Some examples are shown in
(1037) - (1041). Interrogatives that contain pro-forms may be marked with =pe,
as in (1038) and (1039), or not, as in (1037), (1040), and (1041). I do not know
what factors motivate this alternation, but the presence of an interrogative pro-form
means the sentences are formally interrogative and inherently question-like in either
case.6(1037)     ko ai.

     König and Siemund (2007:300) note that, although the application of an interrogative particle
would seem to be superfluous in constituent (question-word) interrogatives, it was nevertheless the
case that in approximately half of the languages they sampled, interrogative particles could option-
ally be added to constituent interrogatives.

         ‘Is that one Ambu, or who?’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).2)11.1.3.6    Speculative sentences
Speculative sentences are those that are marked with -rape (UNC, §9.3.3.2), =koae
or =nokoae (HYP, §10.4.3). Speculative sentences are like interrogatives in that they
are always either include (a reflex of) the interrogative marker =pe and/or include an
interrogative pronoun. However, the interrogative marker is not really productively
applied. Removing pe (or replacing the interrogative pronoun with a noun) does
not result in a corresponding declarative or optative sentence. A speaker typically
uses speculative sentences as an invitation to an addressee to assess a proposition,
without necessarily expecting the addressee to be able to resolve the speaker’s ig-
norance or uncertainty concerning it. An example is shown in (1043).(1043)      a. Speaker A: Lepani Mospi ngo=koae=pe. Lepani hundi-ranua.

ture of alternative interrogatives.

The imperative sentence type generally “indicates the speaker’s desire to influence
future events” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:160) and the optative represents “an ex-
pression of the speaker’s wishes” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:164). I define imperat-
ive sentences in Duna as those headed by a predicate that is inflected as imperative
(§8.2.4.1), and optative sentences as those headed by a predicate that is inflected
as desiderative7 (§8.2.2.4), prohibitive (§8.2.4.2) or hortative (§8.2.4.3). Examples
of imperative and optative sentences are shown in the sections in Chapter 8 that
introduce the relevant morphemes.
    Imperative and optative sentences in Duna share a formal feature that unlike
(most) declaratives they cannot be marked with -na (SPEC) or =nia (ASSERT). Both
sentence types are typically directive in function, being used as requests or com-
mands to get other people to do (or not do) something. They are two distinct sen-
tence types in that optative sentences can be recast as interrogative sentences,8 but
imperatives cannot. Interrogatives formed from optative sentences typically func-
tion as a request for guidance from the addressee concerning the undertaking of a
predicate activity, and are exemplified in §11.2.4.2.
    There remain two TAM markers that, on a semantic and functional basis, are
included here as belonging to the larger notional imperative/optative group: the
‘warning against’ marker -wayeni (§8.2.4.4) and the ‘suggestion’ construction with
kone (§8.2.4.5). At present it is not possible to identify these as comprising distinct
types within the imperative/optative group or otherwise, but from a functional per-
spective sentences that are marked with these forms are directive, and thus more
like imperative and optative sentences than they are like any other kind of sentence.
I have found no examples of them being used in interrogative sentences, or being
marked with =nia or -na, and these possibilities have not been tested.
   7
      That is, when it occurs utterance finally as the only, and terminal, inflection, not when it is
followed by further ancillary morphology (§10.2.2.3) or is part of a complement structure.
    8
      I was first alerted to this possibility by Giles (MSa:L9).
11.1. Overview of sentence types                                                                 421
11.1.5    Assumptive
Assumptive sentences include those with predicates that are marked with certain in-
formation status markers: the shared standpoint morpheme -ra (§9.3.3.1), dramatic
markers (§9.3.3.3), and the provocative inflections (§9.3.4). I call sentences that
are marked with these morphemes ‘assumptive’ because they signal an assumption
the speaker is making concerning the addressee’s state of mind, and express the
speaker’s ‘take’ on the addressee’s epistemic relationship to this proposition.9 For
example, use of the expective marker (§9.3.4.2) signals a speaker’s assumption that
the addressee has failed to consider the situation denoted by the proposition.
    The illocutionary force of an assumptive sentence is complex. They function
somewhat like statements, in that they present the proposition as information that
is known to the speaker. However, each morpheme has further particular functional
characteristics. For example, the expective marker is typically used in obliquely
advising the addressee concerning a course of action, which relates to the function
of directive speech acts. The potential observation marker is typically used in trying
to extract information from the addressee, which relates to the function of questions.
    In keeping with this inherent functional multiplicity, the way certain assumptive
sentences fit in with an overall formal classification of sentence types is problematic.
As can be noted from Table 11.1, assumptive sentences are basically defined neg-
atively as those that do not show features typical of other identified sentence types.
They are grouped together as a collection of misfits that share some formal, func-
tional, and semantic commonalities, but it is not clear that they represent a unified
category of their own, and in some cases there is evidence to support classification
as belonging to another major sentence type.
    For example, the shared viewpoint marker -ra marks a proposition as somehow
familiar to both speaker and hearer. Such utterances are not typically informative,
as the speaker intimates that the addressee already has a pretty good idea of what
he or she is talking about, but they are assertive, and in this respect are similar to
declarative sentences. The shared viewpoint marker also appears to have a formal
property that is typical of declarative markers, the ability to be marked with the SPEC
marker -na. However, it is difficult to assess whether -ra shares the core property of
declarative markers, which is the ability to occur in interrogative sentences.
    The marker -ra does not occur productively with =pe in interrogative sentences,
but this combination is represented in the fused form -rape that occurs in speculative
sentences (§11.1.3.6), so there is not really a clear answer to this question. Further,
   9
     This is not to say that the use of other sentence types does not also involve making assumptions
about the addressee’s state of mind: this is a fairly essential tenet of talking to other people. How-
ever, assumptive sentences necessarily signify something quite particular about the nature of this
assumption, which is not generally the case for other sentence types.
422                                      Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
it is possible to use -ra in a question word interrogative that is not a real question,
but more of a (musing) attempt to recover once known but subsequently forgotten
information. For example, PK explained that the constructed sentence (1046) is
the sort of thing one might say to oneself having momentarily forgotten Kipu’s
destination, and that sentence (1047) would be used if the speaker had forgotten the
date of the addressee’s mother’s arrival and was asking to be reminded of it.","[445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451]"
"9.2.2.2    Personal or impersonal viewpoint
I divide Duna evidential markers into ‘personal’ and ‘impersonal’ forms. Personal
evidentials entail an identifiable perceiver who has a specific viewpoint. This per-
ceiver is typically understood to be the informant person (speaker in declaratives,
addressee in interrogatives, see §11.2.2.1). In extended narrative a central charac-
ter can also be treated as a perceiver, in which case evidential markers reflect this
character’s viewpoint as events unfold.5 All personal evidential markers can occur
   5
    Cf. Banfield’s (1982) discussion of the ‘subjective character’ in narrative, a participant whose
consciousness is adopted, and through whom the reader/listener becomes focussed on the direct
experience of thoughts, feelings, and perceptions (Chun and Zubin 1990). See also Lawrence’s
310                                 Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
with ancillary as well as primary inflectional function and can be followed by the
specificity marker -na; see Chapter 10. Each evidential category in Duna also has
a form that marks impersonal perception, rather than representing a specific view-
point. At least some of the impersonal forms can be used as ancillary markers.
Unlike the personal forms, impersonal evidential markers do not generally occur in
interrogative sentences, and are not marked with -na.
    The personal/impersonal contrast relates somewhat to languages in which the
identity of the perceiver(s) as the speaker, addressee, or both, may be indicated by
a bound form that is portmanteau with or added to an evidential marker. This kind
of feature is found in (relatively) nearby languages of the New Guinea Highlands
region (see Rule 1977; Madden MS; Sillitoe MS; Loughnane and San Roque forth-
coming), as well as further afield (Kroeker 2001 on Nambikuara, Brazil6 ). In Angal
(Mendi), for example, there is a marker which can be added following an evidential
morpheme to signal that both speaker and hearer perceive the evidence in question
(Madden MS).
    In Nambikuara, morphemes that comprise the ‘evidential suffix system’ make
reference to kinds of evidence, for example marking ‘deductive orientation’ (similar
to the Duna results evidential category), and to ‘verification’, which may be either
‘individual’ or ‘collective’. These suffixes indicate tense and occur in combination
with aspect suffixes. Kroeker paraphrases use of an ‘individual verification, de-
ductive orientation’ suffix as signaling “I’m telling you my deduction of an action
that must have occurred because of something I saw/see” (2001:63). In contrast, a
‘collective verification, deduction orientation’ suffix signals “both speaker and ad-
dressee deduce that an action must have taken place” (2001:64). Two examples that
contrast with respect to ‘verification’ value but have the same ‘orientation’ value of
reported evidence (termed ‘narration orientation’ by Kroeker) are shown in (740)

    Although there is some commonality between such systems and Duna, in that a
‘single perceiver’ is contrasted with ‘more than one (potential) perceiver’, the Duna
impersonal forms do not specifically identify the speaker and addressee as joint
perceivers, but rather identify evidence as perceivable without saying by whom.
However, we can see that the Angal, Nambikuara, and Duna systems are all sens-
itive to the notion of differential access to evidence. The use of speaker-only or
personal terms typically highlights one person as probably having better access to
certain evidence or knowledge than anyone else in the speech situation. In contrast,
collective or impersonal terms place the speaker and addressee on a roughly equal
footing in terms of access to evidence. This has some significance to which kinds
of Duna evidential markers are used in questions, that is, in situations where there
is usually a strong assumption that the speech act participants do not have equal
knowledge of the situation (§11.2.2.1).","[338, 339, 340]"

viduality and grouphood, respectively. The two pair marker (PR) forms -ne and
-yane (§6.3.3) indicate ‘pairhood’. These markers make reference to number as part
of their semantics, marking oppositions that are comparable to the singular, dual,
and plural distinctions encoded in personal pronouns (§3.2.3). However, number
is not an obligatory category in Duna, and the SPEC, GP, and PR markers indic-
ate number as a facet of their meaning, rather than as their primary function. The
group marker and the pairing markers are more appropriately described as collect-
ives (Corbett 2000) than as basic number markers.
    The locative marker -ta (§6.3.4.2) and inner/concealing location marker -ra
(§6.3.4.3) provide information concerning the semantic role of the NP referent, and
mark the NP as being in an oblique relation (§4.2.1). The specifications of -ta are
quite general, and it is used in marking NPs with quite a wide range of semantic
roles (e.g., location, goal, path, source). This morpheme can be thought of as a
general oblique case marker. The marker -ra on the other hand is quite narrowly
specified, indicating that the denoted participant is a container-like entity within
which something is concealed (or becomes concealed).
    Some co-occurrence of certain NP markers is possible (illustrated throughout
the following sections), and the order of application in such instances is represented

in Figure 6.2. The current data thus suggest that NP markers divide into three
pairs of mutually exclusive forms, those that mark specificity/grouphood, pairhood,
and grammatical relation/semantic role. Some combinations of NP markers are
particularly unusual; for example, it is very rare for a nominal phrase to include
both the specificity marker -na and another NP marker.

6.3.2     Specificity and grouphood
6.3.2.1    Specific individual -na
Haspelmath (1997:38) observes that “an expression is specific if the speaker pre-
supposes the existence and unique identifiability of its referents”. The Duna marker
-na (SPEC) marks specificity in this sense, indicating that an NP has one uniquely
indentifiable referent. This is exemplified in the contrast between (288) and (289).
Example (288) is a general statement about all cats and rats rather than specific
individuals, and the NPs yawiputi ‘cat’ and uru ‘rat’ are not marked with -na. Sen-
tence (289) is more limited, being an explanation as to why the corpse of a rat just
recovered from a rat-trap should not be given to the house dog. In (289), both yawi
and uru have specific and identifiable real-world referents, and both are marked
with -na. Note however that heka ‘bird (chicken)’ in the latter part of (289) is not
marked with -na, as there is no specific chicken that is being referenced.(288)     yawiputi-ka uru na-na.

from an account by Sane Noma in which he describes how when he was a young
boy living alone in the forest he saw a woman bring some food for pigs, which
he took and ate. There is no previous frame of reference in the text for either the
woman or the food she brings. In (291), Jeremiah Piaro describes a group of people
who have already been detailed in the text as bringing a stove to his house. This

stove was a locally unique item that was the subject of much discussion at the time,
as well as having been spoken of earlier in this particular text.(290)   ima      ndu-ka ita hina        si     hutia.

        ‘They brought the stove.’ (T/JP:250903)    The text excerpt shown in (292) exemplifies how an item can be marked as
specific after its identity has been established in a discourse. In (292a), Kipu Piaro
describes the intended purchase of food (hina), which is at this point non-specific,
non-referential, and modified by the quantifer mbatia ‘some’. The noun hina recurs
as the notional head of an NP with a specific referent (the particular food that was
bought and eaten on this occasion) in (292b).(292)    a. Nikolo-ka hina mbatia stua-ta           sa-nda=nia      ri-tia.

              (T/KP:120205i)   The specific individual marker can attach to proper names, but this is uncommon
except on PNs that occur in complex ‘generic-specifier’ nominals (§5.2.1.5). An
example is shown in (293).(293)   ima      Wakili-na wanengini sakane-ta ko                 kei-na.

        ‘The woman Wakili has become pregnant.’ (T/KK:230205)    Although it is rare, proper names can also be marked with -na when they are
the only lexical constituent of the NP, as in example (294) from a story told by Irari
Hipuya (see also (941)). At this point in the narrative Irari talks about the main char-
acter’s wife who was introduced at the very beginning of the story but has not been
mentioned for several minutes. From his hesitation (indicated by dots) it appears
that Irari takes a moment to remember the name of this person, before marking the
name’s subsequent iterations as specific. It may be that (294) exemplifies a kind of
180                                            Chapter 6. NP, PP, and PlcP morphology
meta-level specificity in which -na marks the name as a specific known word, 13 as
well as (or instead of) indicating that this NP references a specific participant.(294)    sopa Aleya Leyapa =kho iwani roma ... Mbarapiame-na,

         ‘Earlier Aleya Leyapa his wife... Mbarapiame,14 Mbarapiame was staying
         at a place above and he arrived there.’ (T/IH:NH03T6A)    There is one noted example in the textual material in which the specific indi-
vidual marker attaches to a personal pronoun, shown in (295). This is from a point
in a story when a host has been sharing out food and is confused and suspicious as
to why there is a portion left over. He thinks that there must be someone else present
who has not come forward to take their food, but his companions assure him that
nobody is left emptyhanded.(295)    inu-na       ndu na-ra-ya,          inu    kharu-ta      yaka-na=nia.

         ‘There is no one else of us, we are sufficiently counted.’ (T/YS:270205)    The specificity marker can combine with the interrogative root pa- ‘query’,
forming an interrogative which indicates that the speaker is seeking the identity
of a specific place. Examples are shown in (296) - (298). Note that pana occurs as
an unmarked oblique NP that is understood to be place-referent (§6.4.4.4).(296)    ko pa-na          kei.

         ‘Which place does the boy live?’ (ED/2003)   Certain uses of -na SPEC mark contrastive identity between items of the same
kind. One such use is when -na occurs on the quantifier ndu ‘one’, which commonly
  13
      This kind of specificity may also be marked with common nouns. For example, I have observed
that some Duna speakers may mark a word with -na when discussing its meaning. In this case the
‘specific referent’ is the word itself.
   14
      Note that this name ends in the sequence /me/, which is a common feature of the names of
women in traditional Duna stories. Franklin (2003:257) notes that female personal names of the
Kewa people may optionally end in /me/.
6.3. NP markers                                                                     181
marks indefiniteness when a (potentially topical) participant is being introduced to
a text (see for example (148)). The use of ndu in combination with -na may contrast
the identity of one referent with another, and/or assert the separate yet parallel nature
of activities performed by like participants. Some examples are shown in (299) -
(301). In (299), Tindei Kendoli has just finished telling one story, and is now starting
another one with a different main character.(299)   ndu pi, ayu, anoa ndu-na ko.

        ‘The nine brothers, each one hadn’t come... [i.e., none of them had come]’
        (T/YS:KG05V7.22)     Contrastive identity also seems to be implied when the definiteness marker fol-
lows the epistemic demonstrative -ra (§6.2.4), as illustrated in (302). This example
is taken from a pikono story in which two mysterious suitors keep leaving parallel
gifts (in this case, armbands) outside the house of a young woman.(302)   ho-ra-na         kho sa-ta     ro-narua ri-tia-o
        here-SHRD-SPEC 3SG take-SEQ put-NTN . P say-PFV.VIS . P-voc.
        ‘She picked each [armband] up and put them on it was said.’
        (P/PP:KG05V2.15)    Example 302 is unusual, because -ra SHRD and -na SPEC very rarely occur
together. Both morphemes typically indicate that the marked phrase denotes some-
thing that is already known to speaker and addressee, that is, has a definite refer-
ent, and the forms are in near-complementary distribution. In nominal phrases the
demonstrative -ra is typically used preceding an NP marker (the group marker -tia,
pair marker -yane, locative marker -ta, or concealing location marker -ra). In con-
trast, the specificity marker -na cannot occur with -tia, and very rarely occurs with
other NP markers. The demonstrative -ra occurs in place phrases (§6.4), but the
specificity marker -na does not. The typical distribution of -na and -ra as indicators
that the referent of an NP or PlcP is definite is summarised in Table 6.3.
    The specificity marker can occur on verbal predicates of final clauses, as well as
in nominal phrases. This is discussed in §9.3.2.2.

ents.15 Nominal phrases in (303) to (305) denote groups that are made up of the
same kinds of things.(303)     imane-tia-ka           wa ambua ambua sapu reya-na.

          these things [i.e., ancestral traditions].’ (T/RP:270405b)    The group marker is not compatible with the specific individual marker -na16
but groups can be marked as having definite referents with the shared reference
demonstrative -ra (see Table 6.3). The group reference marker does not commonly
attach to personal pronouns or proper names except in lists that detail heterogeneous
group members (§5.4.1), although see also (252).
    The group marker can be used with the interrogative pa-. This combination ap-
pears to create a pronominal term that means roughly ‘which/what things?’ (unlike
pa-na, see (296 - 298), which is typically place-referent). However I only have one
example of this form, shown in (306), and its semantics range needs to be further
investigated.
  15
      The group marker -tia combines with the locational demonstrative ha, but not with the loca-
tional demonstrative ho. The proximal demonstrative hutia (§5.2.4.1) may well be derived from this
construction, so that it no longer occurs as a transparently compositional form.
   16
      Attempts to combine the two morphemes (in both possible orders) on the nominal yawi ‘dog’
were definitively rejected by KK and RA as ungrammatical.

Pair markers indicate that the NP in which they occur refers to a pair, or an item
that is one of a pair.17 The pair markers are in near-contrastive distribution with the
specificity marker -na and group marker -tia and have comparable functions to the
group marker in particular as they are similarly ‘collective’. However pair markers
have on a few occasions been noted to occur in combination with -na and -tia (ex-
emplified in (310) and (311) below). Their meanings are not entirely incompatible,
as it is possible to have a pair that is made up of two specific individuals, or of two
groups of things.
    The forms and the typical distribution18 of the two bound NP pair markers are
shown in Table 6.4. As outlined in the table, the two forms are in near-complementary
distribution. It is generally true to say that -ne applies to nominal roots whereas
-yane applies to demonstratives (including epistemic demonstratives), but there are
a few exceptions to this pattern in the textual data (see, for example, (309)).19 I treat
the pair markers -ne and -yane as variant forms, but with an awareness that fur-
ther study may enable them to be clearly defined as representing related but distinct
categories.","[206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212]"
"3.2.2    Proper names
Proper names (PN) denote particular unique items and are always referential.3 Un-
like personal pronouns (§3.2.3) proper names are not deictic shifters, as the indi-
viduals they denote do not shift with respect to the identities of speaker and ad-
dressee. Duna proper names cannot usually be modified (for example, by demon-
stratives or quantifiers) or marked for specificity with the NP marker -na ‘SPEC’ (al-
   1
      It is noticeable that many human-descriptive nouns have the (immutable) final syllable /ne/,
for example: imane ‘girl, young woman’; khane ‘cross-sex sibling’; wane ‘daughter’. It is likely
that this derives from a fossilised morphological operation, perhaps incorporating the ‘type’ suffix
described in §5.2.1.1.
    2
      The word antia has an additional sense ‘big(gest), fat(test)’, showing a semantic extension that
is quite widespread in the world’s languages, see for example: Matisoff (1991) for a general survey;
Blust (1993) and Donohue and Grimes (2008), mainly in regard to Austronesian languages; and
Evans (2003) on Bininj Gun-Wok (Western Arnhemland, Australia).

though see also examples (165), (278), (294)). Like common nouns, proper names
can function as nominal specifiers, following a generic term (§5.2.1.5).
    I divide Duna proper names into three groups: personal names (PSN), place
names (PLN), and social grouping names (GPN). These are not strictly distinct cat-
egories, but show different patterns of typical use that spring largely from their
different semantic domains of reference.","[100, 101]"
"3.6.3    The quantifier ndu
The quantifier ndu is an alternative form to mbitu (Table 3.8) for the number ‘one’,
but has some additional features and functions that are not shared by other quantifi-
ers.
     Like spatial demonstratives (§3.7), ndu can combine with epistemic markers to
form a complex epistemic demonstrative (§6.2.1), and like directional demonstrat-
ives it can be marked with a PlcP marker (§6.4). It can also function as: an adverbial
expression (immediately preceding the verb), meaning something like ‘on one/some
occasion’, ‘at one/some point’; an adverbial expression in combination with the
adjective kete ‘little’ (425); a pro-form in left dislocation constructions (105); a
marker of indefiniteness in contrast to the NP marker -na ‘SPEC’ (§6.3.2.1); and
can perhaps combine with some interrogatives to form expressions that function as
indefinite pronouns (360).
     The quantifier ndu combines with some bound morphemes in non-standard ways
to form several idiomatic expressions, shown in (21).23 (21)     a. ndu-lu-(ngi)
              one-OCC-TIME

      The form ndulu as shown in (21a) is commonly pronounced with an o rather than u in the
first syllable. See also §2.1.2.4 concerning the importance of ndu pronunciation as a shibboleth for
north-western Duna people.
3.7. Demonstratives                                                                85
pronouns, which can have pointing (or deictic) reference”. Diessel (1999) defines
four syntactic contexts in which demonstratives occur: as independent pronouns
that occupy an adpositional or verbal argument position (‘pronominal’); with nouns
in nominal phrases (‘adnominal’); as verb modifiers (‘adverbial’); and in copula
and non-verbal clauses (‘identificational’). There is no evidence that the ‘identific-
ational’ distinction is formally relevant in Duna (although see §6.2.5) and I do not
employ it further in my description. I call a demonstrative that occurs as part of a
nominal phrase (NP) or place phrase (PlcP) a ‘referring’ demonstrative, in contrast
to adverbial demonstratives (which are not specifically described in this thesis).
    Duna demonstratives form a closed class of words that provide information
about the ‘positioning’ of something (for example, a participant, a predicated activ-
ity) relative to speech-act participants and the environment. I define two classes of
Duna demonstratives: ‘proximal’ (§3.7.1) and ‘spatial’. Spatial demonstratives are
further divided into the ‘locational’ (§3.7.2) and ‘directional’ (§3.7.3) subclasses.","[113, 114]"

336                               Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
9.2.9    The perfective TAM marker revisitedAs can be seen in Table 9.4, the majority of evidential markers are used as primary
inflections in declarative (or interrogative) sentences that describe past time events.
In this respect, they are in contrast with the perfective TAM inflection described
in §8.2.2.1. This raises the question of whether the perfective inflection, like the
morphemes to which it is opposed, itself encodes an information source value; is it
really just marking a temporal feature, or does it also say something in particular
about evidence?
    Two additional information source types that are of particular relevance to this
issue are the ‘participatory’ (also termed ‘performative’) and ‘factual’, because
these are the kinds of evidence that the perfective might reasonably encode.31 Par-
ticipatory information source relates to situations in which the speaker is actively
involved in the event described, and knows of it as a participant.32 Factual inform-
ation source relates to “actions or states which have been observed enough by the
speaker for him to generalize them as true and [...] which are simply common
knowledge” (Oswalt 1986:36).
    The construal of factual and participatory semantics as a distinct category or
categories within an evidential system is a feature of languages such as Kashaya
(Oswalt 1986) and Central Pomo (Mithun 1999) of the Pomo family, northern Cali-
fornia, and, closer to home, Oksapmin (Loughnane 2007; forthcoming) and Foe
(Rule 1977). In Central Pomo for example, one of a set of seven enclitics is nor-
mally added to an inflected verb to indicate information source. Categories distin-
guished in this evidential system include ‘general knowledge’ (factual) and ‘per-
sonal experience of one’s own action’ (participatory), as well as those that encode
more canonical information source types such as hearsay, inference, and auditory
evidence (Mithun 1999:181).
    In Foe and Oksapmin evidentiality is an obligatory verbal inflectional category
in at least some areas of the grammar (for example, indicative past tense forms). By
this, I mean that the encoding of information source can be identified as a requisite
component in the grammatical system: in certain kinds of sentences, a speaker must
choose not whether, but which kind of, evidence is specified. In Foe and Oksapmin,
verbal inflections that make reference to features such as visual or other sensory ob-
servation are formally contrasted with an inflection that makes reference to factual
and participatory meaning; participatory/factual semantics are grammaticised as an  31
      Aikhenvald (2004) and Willett (1988) do not generally recognise participatory or factual mean-
ing as being relevant to evidential systems cross-linguistically.
   32
      Compare Oswalt’s definition of the performative in Kashaya: “the speaker knows of what he
speaks because he is performing the action himself or has just performed it” (1986:34).
9.2. Evidential markers                                                                               337
evidential category.33
     The kinds of evidential systems outlined above thus suggest a particular ques-
tion concerning the Duna perfective inflection, namely, whether it is a semantic-
ally complex form that specifies both time and information source, and represents
a participatory and/or factual evidential category.34 If it were, this would allow an
analysis that evidentiality is an obligatorily marked category within a certain area of
Duna grammar (declarative sentences that denote past time events). However, while
it seems very likely that the perfective inflection at least implies participatory/factual
semantics as a consequence of contrast with other possible primary inflections, at
this stage there is insufficient evidence to claim that it actively encodes information
source and is itself an evidential marker.
    In languages in which participatory and/or factual evidential markers occur, they
are members of a closed set of mutually exclusive morphemes that have information
source as a primary meaning. That is, there are compelling categorical reasons, as
well as semantic and functional motivations, to treat the markers in question as
evidential.
    This is not so in the Duna case, as there are clear indications that while the per-
fective inflection contrasts with each evidential marker, it is not part of the same
formal set. As has already been mentioned, the perfective inflection has much more
restricted distribution than evidential markers, as it only occurs as a primary in-
flection on verbal predicates, whereas evidentials can occur as ancillary markers
with verbs (§10.2.3), and most can mark nominal predicates (§10.3). The evidential
markers as identified in §9.2 comprise a mutually exclusive set of forms that cannot
co-occur; however, many of them are attested occurring in combination with the per-
fective inflection (§10.2.2.5). Verbs that are inflected as perfective are commonly
further marked with epistemic particles (§10.4), whereas verbs that are inflected
with evidential markers typically are not, and in some cases are barred from doing
so (§10.4.2). A further significant point concerns the application of the assertion
  33
      In the Oksapmin case, as described by Loughnane (2007), the participatory/factual evidential
is zero-marked in some person/aspect categories, and is also the inflection that can be most widely
used in more complex morphological structures. For example, a preverbal particle that encodes
inference can be used with a verb that bears a participatory/factual inflection, in which case the
information source meaning of this inflection is bleached. Thus, the participatory/factual forms are
the functionally unmarked way of expressing past tense in the grammar. Nevertheless, as argued by
Loughnane (2007), in view of the paradigmatic formal opposition displayed and contexts in which
the independent inflection is appropriate, the most sensible interpretation is that verbal markers
comprise a distinct evidential category—the participatory/factual—in these languages.
   34
      One alternative analysis would be to posit a ‘zero’ participatory/factual evidential marker. How-
ever this would not add anything to the present discussion, which is concerned with markers that can
occur as primary inflections. Such a morpheme would have to be defined as a marker that can only
occur in an ancillary capacity (Chapter 10), as it is not the case that a verb can occur as a final predic-
ate in (apparent) bare root form, inflected with the postulated ‘zero’ participatory/factual evidential
only.
338                                 Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
marker =nia (§11.1.2.1), which marks certain kinds of declarative sentences. This
form is not applied to verbal clauses following evidential markers, but is commonly
added following the perfective inflection.
    Additionally, there are some problems with saying that the perfective TAM
inflection contrasts exclusively with evidential markers, because certain informa-
tion status markers are also available for use as primary inflections in describing
past time events (§9.3.3, §9.3.4.3). These morphemes are also (at least margin-
ally) present in the overall ‘past time’ group as contrastive forms (Table 8.2), and
this makes the proposal that the perfective inflection marks a specifically evidential
value less compelling.
    We must therefore look mainly at contexts of use to examine whether the per-
fective inflection encodes participatory/factual semantics, and at the current time it
is not clear that this is the case. Further analysis and data are required to investigate
a) the presence and strength of a correlation between use of the perfective inflection
and participatory/factual meaning; and b) whether any such meanings can be con-
vincingly distinguished from those that might arise through a situation of ‘default’
use, where the perfective inflection is an unspecified form that implies epistemic
assessment values by dint of contrast only, rather than positive specification.35
    In sum, I find that there is not a strong case for defining the perfective TAM
marker as a morpheme that actively encodes information source. However, because
most of the morphemes to which it is opposed specify particular kinds of non-
participatory information source, this inflection is likely to at least imply a speaker’s
involvement with the event that is so described, and/or their understanding of it as
  35
     For example, it is possible to make a general observation that verbs in the textual data which
denote events in which the speaker was personally involved as an active participant (for example, in
clauses with a speaker subject) are usually inflected as perfective (and are not followed by further
markers of epistemic assessment). However, this could just as easily be a consequence of the fact
that evidential markers are rarely appropriate to speaker subjects in statements (§11.2.2), rather than
reflecting the fact that the perfective inflection is inherently participatory in meaning.
   Similarly, while the perfective inflection is quite commonly used in those histories which can be
posited as representing as general ‘facts’ or common knowledge (for example, the narrative concern-
ing the origin of Lake Kopiago), there are also myriad examples in the textual data of the perfective
occurring as an independent inflection on sentences describing events that the speaker would not
claim to have been directly involved in, and would not claim to be general factual knowledge (for
example one-off ‘made up’ stories with imaginary characters). There are several competing conclu-
sions that could reasonably be drawn from such use. One is to say that the perfective inflection is
completely neutral in regard to epistemic assessment features and anybody can use it anytime about
anything, with no concomittant evidential or validational (etc.) effects. Another is to say that it does
specify a participatory/factual evidential value, but that this is construed from the point of view of
characters within the narrative, as other evidentials are. A further option is to say that the perfective
inflection, although not positively specified, typically implies factualness, participation, etc, but that
this can be construed within the larger frame of the narrative (cf. Lidz 2007). That is, it is not spe-
cifically encoding a personal viewpoint, but can be understood to be functionally unmarked in the
context of the story-world, rather than in the actual world. This latter interpretation seems the most
convincing to me.

9.3.1    Introduction
In this section I introduce a further group of bound forms, ‘information status mark-
ers’, that can occur in an inflectional capacity on final verbs in statements. The in-
formation status markers as applied to regular verbs are listed in Table 9.5. A sum-
mary of how these markers occur on consonantal and wa-class verbs is provided in
§9.2.8. Some of these forms can occur in combination with certain TAM markers
and/or evidential markers; see Chapter 10.","[363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368]"
"3.2.3     Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns are terms that are used in reference to participants in the speech
situation (speaker, adressee, and groups of which they are part) and other things
(typically people, that is, potential speakers or addressees) whose identity is as-
sumed to be recoverable from context (Schachter and Shopen 2007:24).
   Duna personal pronouns comprise a closed subclass of nominals. Personal pro-
nouns typically constitute a complete NP (§5.3.1). Unlike common nouns they are

they were typically blond babies; see Gillespie (2007b:107-8).

not modified by postposed constituents such as quantifiers and demonstratives, and
unlike both common nouns and proper names they do not occur as nominal spe-
cifiers. Personal pronouns (excluding special contrasted subject (CS) forms, see
Table 3.3) can be doubled to emphasise the solitary nature of a participant (§5.4.2.3).
They may also be marked with the ‘exclusive identity’ marker -nga (§6.6.2). This
morpheme does not occur on other nominals (although it is applicable to locational
demonstrative roots, see §6.4.4.1).
    The ‘unmarked’ set of personal pronouns (that is, as opposed to CS forms) dis-
tinguishes first (1), second (2), and third (3) person and singular (SG), dual (DL),
and plural (PL) number as shown in Table 3.2. Within the plural pronouns, there
is a conflation of the first and second person reference forms. Third person pro-
nouns can be encliticised to NPs, and are typically only used in denoting subject
arguments and possessors (§5.3.1.1, §6.6.3).","[102, 103]"
"7.5.2   Adjunct noun constructions
In an adjunct noun construction the predicate consists of a noun (N) and an con-
sonantal or wa-class verb. The noun cannot be analysed as denoting a participant
that is subcategorised for by the verb (it is not an argument), is non-referential, and
is typically not modified either lexically (for example, by a postposed adjective)
or morphologically (for example, by an NP marker). The noun is placed after all
other referring expressions that occur in the clause and usually immediately pre-
cedes the verb. The noun contributes to the semantics of the predicate in a way that
is semi-transparent, but is not predictable or productive.
    The general template for a typical adjunct noun construction is shown in Figure
7.4. This template resembles the structure of a verb adjunct construction in that a
non-verb element immediately precedes the verb, contributing to the meaning of the
predicate. However, unlike a verb adjunct construction, the argument structure of
the predication is entirely predictable from the verb, and the noun and verb cannot
be treated as comprising a unitary stem for the purposes of negation.

                      Figure 7.4 Typical ‘adjunct noun’ construction     An example of an adjunct noun construction is shown in (547a). The predicate
consists of the bivalent verb suwa- ‘hold’ in combination with the common noun re
‘eye’ and means ‘watch closely, guard’. The clause includes both a subject NP (no,
‘I’) and object NP (anda ‘house’), and as the verb is bivalent there is no subcatgor-
ised participant slot left that re could be occupying as an argument. In all elicited
and textual examples of this construction, the noun re ‘eye’ immediately precedes
the verb. However, in constructed sentences placing the day-term hata between the
adjunct noun and the verb as in (547b) was judged acceptable, showing that the
noun is not formally bound to the verb root. Another example that includes the
expression re suwa- is shown in (548).

noun with suwa- ‘hold’. This expression means ‘count time periods’, and relates
to the traditional practice of marking time periods by tying knots in a cord (KK
pers. comm.). Example (550) shows sia ‘foot/leg’ occurring as an adjunct noun in
construction with the verb ka- ‘be/stand’ in an expression that means ‘step, place
one’s foot’.(549)    mali            paneki suwa=pe ke-nda khana pongo suwa-no.

         ‘Now when we see the baby can step and go, like Monica...’ (T/HS:061103i)    The adjunct noun construction anoa nga- (lit. ‘man go’) exemplified in (552) is
a monovalent predicate that means ‘marry (with a man)’.21 Example (553) shows
that the adjunct noun cannot precede the subject NP no ‘I’. Example (554) shows
that when it occurs in construction with nga- the noun anoa ‘man’ is not a suit-
able candidate to head a full NP; further information concerning the nature of the
marrying partner is expressed through the addition of a pair-marked NP (§5.4.1).22(552)    no phukao-ya no anoa nga-ya...

     The bivalent verb rou- is used to describe a man marrying a woman.

     When using a referential NP that denotes a particular husband (‘X’), it is more usual to use an
alternative idiom, ‘go to X’s house’ to describe marriage, as shown in (551).

constructions such as those shown in (547a) to (552) are not usually negated as a
unit, as shown by the unacceptability of (555a). Negation can be expressed through
applying the negative circumfix to the verb only, as shown in (555b). Example
(555b) shows that in an alternative interrogative (§11.1.3.4) the nominal may be
omitted at the second iteration of the predicate.(555)   a. * Juli anoa ngo=pe na-anoa nga-ya

    Object-verb predications are predications that involve an NP and a verb. They
do not really represent a single formally distinct construction type, as the major
defining criterion is semantic and gradient rather than structural and categorically
discrete. Clauses that include object-verb predications show some characteristics
of ordinary bivalent clauses with subject and object NPs. They also share similar-
ities with adjunct noun constructions in that word order is typically restricted, and
the meaning of the predication is substantially derived from a nominal constituent.
Object-verb predications are similar to ‘restricted collocations’ (Cowie 1998), com-
binations of words where the meaning of one element is “governed by its association
with another word or phrase” (Pawley 2007:7), for example, the expression ‘meet
demands’ in English. They are also idiomatic under Nunberg et al.’s (1994) defini-
tion in that the meaning cannot be predicted from the sum of its parts, and a literal

interpretation of the phrase is cases possible, albeit rather odd. Some examples of
object-verb predications are shown in Table 7.10.
    It can be seen in Table 7.10 that some object-verb predications are part of a
family of expressions which follow a generalised semantic structure, rather than
being one-off expressions. For example, the existential verb (e)ra- ‘be/put’ occurs
in construction with nouns that denote bodily substances in clauses that describe
extrusion or excretion. The more members there are of the family, the more tenable
it becomes to say that what we are dealing with here is (constructional) polysemy
of the verb (see also §7.5.4.2).
   Examples (556) - (560) illustrate some of the expressions shown in Table 7.10.
The apparent ‘object’ noun is unmodified and immediately precedes the verb.(556)   khia ra-nda          ma   ru.

        ‘I will hang myself.’ (lit. eat rope) (ED)    As with adjunct nominal constructions, placing the ‘object’ noun before the sub-
ject argument usually doesn’t work; see (561) and (562). This kind of inflexibility
argues against treating the expression as a typical bivalent clause (as subject and
object NPs can normally appear in either SO or OS order, the latter being pragmat-
ically marked).(561)   * heka imane su
          bird girl      hold.PFV

          cord 1SG eat-INT
        * I will hang myself (CD/XIV:156)
        (Could mean: ‘I will eat cord’)    However, for at least some expressions, the nominal appears to be the head of a
full NP that references a P argument. In (563) the noun is modified by an adjective.
In (564) the noun is marked as specific (that is, is clearly referential) and does not
occur in the same clause as its host verb but in the preceding clause, that is, the
item is referenced through zero anaphora. In (564), there is no reason to analyse
mbalutana ‘the plane’ as anything other than an object NP, beyond the fact that it
collocates with a particular specialised meaning of the verb suwa- ‘hold’. This is
not in itself sufficient grounds to propose a distinct structural relationship.(563)   ho-na         nane kete si-tia        ri-na.

        (T/JP:KG05V7.11)    Individual object-verb predications show some differences concerning whether
or not the nominal element and the verb in the construction must be immediately
contiguous. For example, for the phrase khiau suwa- ‘use fire-making kit’, it is
possible for the time/manner word ala to occur in between the constituents (565),
and a locative NP can occur between hapa ‘egg’ and era- ‘put’ in the expression
‘lay eggs’ (566). See also the phrase mali suwa- ‘hold a mali dance’ in (549), in
which an (interrogative) temporal occurs in between the noun and the verb.(565)   no hawa na-nda            khiau ala suwa-nda...

        ‘Now the kango bird lays its eggs in trees [they] say.’ (T/HS:080305ib)     However, RA and KK judged that the phrase heka suwa- ‘transform into a bird’
does not allow a temporal to be interposed, as shown in (567) and (568). The expres-
sion is fixed, and the special meaning it has cannot be maintained if arrangement of
its elements is disrupted.(567)   imane ndu (ala) heka (*ala) su.

        girl   one yesterday bird yesterday hold.PFV
        ‘A young woman (yesterday) turned into (*yesterday) a bird.’ (CD/XIV:76)    Like adjunct noun constructions, object-verb predications do not undergo unit-
ary negation. If the negative circumfix is used it will be applied to the verb only. An
example is shown in (569). However, the lexical negator neya (§8.3.3) is preferred
for object-verb predications.(569)   imane-na heka su=pe, na-si-ya.

7.5.4     Inceptive/factitive uses of ka- ‘be/stand’
7.5.4.1    Adjunct noun type
The verb ka- ‘be/stand’ can occurs in construction with a noun that cannot be iden-
tified as denoting an argument, is unmodified, and immediately precedes the verb,
that is, resembles an adjunct noun. However, the derived predication may be either
ambivalent or bivalent. This goes against the usual pattern of adjunct noun con-
structions, in that the argument structure of the complex predication is different
from that of the verb when it occurs alone as a simple predicate. A general template
for constructions that use employ ka- in this way is shown in Figure 7.6.

means ‘begin’. This can head a monovalent clause, as in (570), or a bivalent clause
as in (571).(570)     hata       ka-ta         arene      se     kutia.

          (IV/KK-KY:KG05)    Nominals that denote liquids or transferrable substances such as dirt or mud
occur like adjunct nouns with ka- ‘be/stand’ to describe saturation or staining, as
shown in (572) and (573). Example (573) shows that adverbial modifiers such as
peli ‘well, thoroughly’ can either precede the nominal or be interposed between the
nominal and the verb (but not both at the same time).(572)     no slipas iwa-ta         nga-yaroko, khiapo ndola-ya, haka khiapo

Other complex predicates with ka- ‘be/stand’ are more like object-verb predications.
In combination with certain nouns, ka- appears to have the bivalent sense ‘make’,
as shown in (576) - (578). The nominal occurs in an NP that refers to the ‘made’
item. A general template for a clause in which ka- has this ‘make’ sense is shown
in Figure 7.7.23

    This construction relates to possessive expansion of existential clauses (§7.5.5.1), in that a
monovalent existential verb is used as a quasi-bivalent predicate to describe a relationship between
two items.

Some adjectives can be marked with verbal inflections and head verbal clauses.
Verbal clauses headed by an adjective are monovalent and generally atelic, describ-
ing a constant state rather than a changing process. Alternatively, adjectival roots
may occur as part of a complex predicate preceding the verb ka- ‘be/stand’. The
general pattern of this construction is represented in Figure 7.8. As can be seen
from a comparison of this structure with that shown in Figure 7.3, the adjectival
root is somewhat equivalent to a verb adjunct in a verb adjunct construction.

    Complex predicates composed of an adjective + ka- show similar properties to
verb adjunct constructions in that ka- supplies an inceptive/factitive frame but little
semantic content. They are also similar in that they may be negated by the negative
circumfix as a single unit, as shown in (585a). In this case both RA and KK felt that
negating the verb only as in (585b) was equally acceptable.(585)     a. ka ipa roro ko=pe,                  na-roro ka-ya.

7.5.5.1    Expressing possession
In many non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea existential clauses can be ‘ex-
panded’ to express possession (Rumsey 2002). In this section I provide examples of
the three major Duna existential verbs ka- ‘be/stand’, ra- ‘be/sit’ and era- ‘be/put’
as they occur in this kind of possessive clause.
    The relationship between an existential clause (examples (586) - (588)) and an
expanded existential possessive clause (examples (589) - (593)) is summarised in
Figure 7.9. The grammatical status of the NPs in expanded existential clauses is
discussed further at the close of this section.

    In monovalent use, existential verbs describe the existence or location of someone
or something as shown in (586) - (588). The nature of the S argument (for example,
as a large upright vs small squat animal) determines which existential verb is selec-
ted (§3.3.2).(586)     ita teng    raki       khou-ra       kei.

possessive relationship. Examples are shown in (589) - (593).(589)   no ita phukao ndu kei.

          ? I have two pigs {I saw} (ED/XV:19)    The oddness of the use of the visual evidential in (599) could also be because
this morpheme has a distancing effect (§11.2.2.6). It sounds strange to describe
one’s own possessive relationship with something using a morpheme that implies
one has nothing to do with the predicated state. Nevertheless, there remains some
justification for regarding the possessor as a subject in this situation. The structure
of an expanded existential clause under this reading is represented as in Figure 7.10.
The possessor is a subject, and the possessed item—which continues to control the
existential verb that is selected—is like an object NP in an object-verb predication.

7.5.5.2    Existential verb as copula
As described in §4.1.1.1, nominal phrases can occur as non-verbal predicates in
clauses that express relationships of equation and attribution. These are generally
understood to describe relationships that are currently observable. Alternatively, the
time-frame of a relationship of proper inclusion can be made explicit through the
addition of an existential verb. This verb serves as a copula, forming a complex

This section describes a range of constructions that are grouped together on the
semantic basis that they describe involuntary experience (cf. Pawley et al. 2000).
As the subject argument in clauses headed by involuntary experience predications
in non-volitional, some morphological operations (for example, CS-marking of the
subject argument, see §6.6.1) and typical structural restrictions (for example, the
dispreference for evidential marking in a clause with an informant subject, see
§11.2.2) are not maintained as typical correlates of subject identity.
    The different kinds of complex predicates that describe involuntary experience
can generally be identified as structurally analogous (to at least some extent) with
one of the constructions described in §7.4 or §7.5. Sections §7.6.1.1 and §7.6.1.2
describe two kinds of predications that are composed of a noun in combination with
a verb, and show some similarities to the adjunct noun and object-verb predications
described in §7.5.2 and §7.5.3, respectively. In §7.6.2.1 I look at four ‘involuntary
experience expressions’ which are perhaps derived from verb adjunct predications,
but show features suggestive of lexicalisation as nominal/verbal roots in at least two
cases. Section 7.6.2.2 examines clauses that include ‘emotion words’, which can
function as either verbal roots, or as nominal roots in construction with a verb.","[274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287]"
"1.4    Thesis overview
This thesis describes certain structures of Duna grammar that are used in building
simple sentences, and looks in detail at some semantic themes that are encoded in
the bound morphemes of the language, particularly those that are to do with ex-
pressing attitudes to knowledge. It is an introduction to the language, and does not
present a comprehensive inventory of Duna grammatical morphemes and opera-
tions, or deal with complex sentence structures (for example, those involving clause
embedding or coordination).
    Chapter 2 provides an overview of Duna phonology, including a description of
the phonemic inventory and the major allophones of these phonemes, and a prelim-
inary statement concerning lexical tone in monomorphemic words. In Chapter 3, I
define Duna word classes as referred to in this thesis, and list the known members
of small closed classes. Chapter 4 presents an overview of major clause types and
features of basic clause structure.
    In Chapters 5 and 6, I examine the structure of nouns, nominal phrases (NPs),
place phrases (PlcPs), and postpositional phrases (PP), constituents that typically
occur to represent participants in the clause. This includes an account of morpholo-
1.4. Thesis overview                                                                27
gically complex nouns and the lexical structure of NPs (Ch. 5), and itemisation and
illustration of bound morphemes that indicate the epistemic positioning, number,
definiteness, grammatical function, semantic role, and/or prominence of the phrase
to which they are added (Ch. 6).
    In Chapters 7 to 11, I look in more detail at predicating constituents. Chapter
7 provides examples and discussion of certain complex predicate constructions, in-
cluding complex verbs, serialised verbs, and predicates that are composed of a verb
in combination with a free lexeme such as a noun or adjective.
    Chapter 8 begins my exploration of bound forms that occur on ‘final’ predicates.
Final predicates head an independent clause that constitutes a complete sentence
in itself, or occurs last in a chain of dependent clauses. Chapter 8 is concerned
with inflectional forms that occur on verbs, and indicate time, event modality, and
polarity features of the predicated activity, for example whether it is complete or
ongoing, or whether the speaker desires it to occur.
    In Chapter 9 I describe two groups of bound forms (evidential and information
status markers) that a speaker can use as final verb inflections to supply an epistemic
assessment of the proposition that is encoded in the utterance, as well as to supply
temporal information. Evidential markers typically indicate a source of information
(for example, whether the predicated activity was seen to occur), and information
status markers encode other kinds of attitudes towards the proposition (for example
as knowledge that is new or familiar).
    In Chapter 10, I illustrate complex final morphology constructions in which
evidential and information status markers are added following inflected verb forms
rather than bare roots, discuss the use of these forms in non-verbal clauses, and
introduce some further bound forms and constructions that are concerned in the
expression of epistemic assessment.
    Chapter 11 examines final predicate markers as described in Chapters 8 to 10
with respect to the sentence types of Duna, focussing on the way that certain forms
make different predictions about the relationship of the speaker to the proposition
in interrogative as opposed to non-interrogative sentences. In this last chapter I also
provide an overview of epistemic assessment and the final predicate in Duna.
Chapter 2Phonology
This chapter itemises the segmental phonemes of Duna and their major allophones,
and outlines some generalised phonological processes (§2.1). In §2.2 I describe
some aspects of contrastive lexical pitch, and §2.3 provides a key to the orthography
used in this thesis.","[55, 56, 57]"

3.3    Verbs
Words that are members of a ‘verb’ class typically express actions, processes, and
states (Schachter and Shopen 2007:9; Evans 2000:712). A Duna verb typically
functions as the head of a clausal predicate, in which case the verb root must be
inflected (either medially or finally). The ordering of bound verbal morphology is
represented in Figure 3.1. Derivational affixes and directional demonstrative roots
3.3. Verbs                                                                                      75
occur in the ‘modifier’ position following the verb root (§7.2). The negative cir-
cumfix (§8.3) is applied to the (modified) stem, deriving a negative stem that can be
used as a medial or final verb or have inflectional morphology added to it (that is,
once the negative circumfix has been applied to a verb, further inflectional mark-
ing is possible but not strictly obligatory). With respect to final verbs, ‘inflectional
morphology’ includes tense, aspect, and event modality markers (§8.2), evidential
markers (§9.2), and information status markers (§9.3). Duna also has a range of
medial inflectional morphemes (not described in this thesis) that typically indicate a
time or aspect value with respect the following clause (for example if the predicated
activity is completed before the activity predicated in the following clause begins)
as well as signaling features concerning ‘cohesion’ (for example, if the identity of
the controlling argument changes from one clause to the next). In complex predic-
ations up to three verb roots can occur in series, with only the last verb of the series
bearing inflectional morphology (§7.3).

                           Figure 3.1 Ordering of verbal morphology
    Predicating verbs determine the argument structure of a clause (although see
also Chapter 7 concerning complex predication). I describe verbal roots in Duna
as monovalent (taking one argument), bivalent (taking two arguments) or trivalent
(taking three arguments). Monovalent, bivalent, and trivalent clause types are de-
scribed and exemplified in §4.1. Some verbal roots can take either one argument or
two arguments and I refer to these as ambivalent verbs (§4.2.3.4).
    There are three (partly cross-cutting) closed verb classes within the class of
verbs. Two of these are defined on the basis of shared morphological and distri-
butional characteristics. The third group, existential verbs, is defined through a
combination of formal and functional features.","[103, 104]"

     The word maki in ‘mark out, choose’ is presumably derived from English ‘mark’ or Tok Pisin
‘makim’. As I have never noted this word occurring as a noun or verb I classify it as a verb adjunct
(rather than, for example, a serialised verb root or adjunct noun). It is not uncommon for Tok Pisin
verbs to be borrowed into Duna as verb adjuncts.

suffix -pa to anga ra- ‘collect, gather’, rather than using the suppletive imperat-
ive verb form ra ‘be/put.IMP’ (see (537), previous). This is suggestive of either a
general trend of regularisation of consonantal verbs, and/or a lexicalisation of the
expression anga ra- as a regular verb root rather than an adjunct + verb combination.(540)     khana anga ra-pa            ruwa-ta...

Verb adjunct constructions can be formed with the bivalent consonantal verbs suwa-
‘hold’, sa- ‘take, get’ , kuwa ‘carry’, kua- ‘hide’ and sa- ‘strike’.18 Some attested
combinations of verb adjuncts with these verbs are shown in Table 7.9 and exem-
plified in (541) - (546).
    The complex predicates shown in Table 7.9 head bivalent clauses, that is, the
argument structure of the verb is the same as in simple predication. The verbs
contribute more or less recognisable semantic content. For example, kua- ‘hide’
relates generally to hiding things away and suwa- ‘hold’ to retaining, but sa- ‘take,
get’ does little beyond supplying a bivalent and telic frame.(541)     no antia-ka nane ambolo ndu ngora ki-tia.

7.5.1    Introduction
The kinds of complex predicates looked at so far involve morphemes that typically
occur as part of a predicating constituent.19 This section examines complex predic-
  19
   The exception to this is complex verbs that include a directional demonstrative. Directional
demonstratives have a wide range of functions and probably most typically occur as PlcP constituents
244                                         Chapter 7. Some complex predicate structures
ations involving nouns, morphemes that are typically used in participant reference.
These include some more idiomatic predications that are not easily identified as
structurally distinct and productive operations. Rather, a combination of certain
words in certain expressions appears to ‘borrow’ an existing grammatical structure
in the language in an idiomatic way.
   I begin by looking at two general classes of construction that I term ‘adjunct
noun constructions’ and ‘object-verb predications’.
    A complex predication with an ‘adjunct noun’ (§7.5.2)20 is one in which an un-
modified noun precedes a consonantal or wa-class verb, supplies semantic content
to the predication, and does not occupy an argument slot of the clause as required
by the verb. For example, if the verb is bivalent, the adjunct noun is additional to
(rather than replacing or making redundant) separate subject and object NPs that
may occur in the clause. The adjunct noun must follow other NPs, PPs and PlcPs in
the clause, although some other kinds of constituents (for example, temporals) may
be acceptably interposed between the adjunct noun and the verb.
    An ‘object-verb predication’ (§7.5.3) is one in which a nominal phrase occupies
the P argument slot of a consonantal or wa-class bivalent verb. The apparent object
NP works in construction with the verb to provide the meaning of the predication,
and so cannot be elided in the usual way (§4.2.3.3). Object-verb predications are
idiomatic, in that the structure as a whole can be assigned a ‘literal’ meaning that
is distinct from its typical interpretation (Nunberg et al. 1994). Specific pairings
of nouns and verbs in Duna object-verb predications differ as to whether they are
fixed expressions that structurally resemble adjunct noun constructions in certain
ways (being more restricted in terms of word order flexibility and NP complex-
ity/referentiality, and less semantically transparent) or more like independent object
NP and verb constituents in a typical bivalent clause.
    Section 7.5.4 discusses a number of further expressions employing the verb ka-
‘be/stand’ that do not clearly match the structure of the other kinds of complex pre-
dicates discussed. As a simple predicate, this verb occurs with monovalent sense.
However, in combination with certain nouns, nominal phrases, or adjectives, it ex-
hibits a constructional ambivalency; the introduction of a nominal or adjectival ele-
ment can apparently license an additional argument in the clause. These expressions
are thus different from adjunct noun constructions, in which the argument structure
of the verb is unchanged; and from object-verb predications, in which the colloca-or free adverbial elements.
   20
      I use the phrase ‘adjunct noun’ as an alternative to the phrase ‘adjunct (nominal)’ that is often
used in the Papuanist literature for nominal-like words that occur in constructions similar to those
described in this section. I use ‘noun’ rather than ‘nominal’ as in the Duna case the relevant words
are recognisable as ordinary common nouns.

tion of the object and the verb creates a special meaning.
    Finally, I look at special uses of existential verbs in the delineation of a relation-
ship of possession (§7.5.5.1) or proper inclusion (§7.5.5.2) between two items that
are expressed as NPs in the clause.","[269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274]"
"5.2.3.2    Non-numerical quantifiers
Known non-numerical quantifiers are itemised in Table 3.9. Two examples of NPs
that include the quantifier mbatia ‘some’ are shown in (145) and (146).(145)     [wi        mbatia] so         ri-tia.

          [Q]N P
          ‘[He] held some [food] in his stomach...’ (T/PK:201003i)    Non-numerical quantifiers that describe a proportion commonly occur as adja-
cent NPs in a ‘whole-part’ construction (§5.4.2.1). Non-numerical quantifiers are
rarely followed by the NP markers -na ‘SPEC’, -tia ‘GP’ or -(ya)ne ‘PR’; their se-
mantic domains overlap to some extent and the forms are in some cases functionally
opposed (see, for example, mbatia versus -na SPEC in (292a-292b)).

5.2.3.3      The quantifier ndu ‘one’
The quantifier ndu ‘one’ typically occurs in NPs that have indefinite reference, func-
tionally contrasting to some extent with the specificity marker -na SPEC (§6.3.2.1).
Example (147) shows ndu following the common noun imanoa, ‘person, people’ in
an expression that is functionally eqivalent to an indefinite pronoun such as Eng-
lish ‘someone’ or ‘anyone’.14 Example (148) shows an early line of a narrative, in
which new protagonists are being introduced.(147)      ...imanoa ndu ho-rane             ke-ta, rẽware        reware    reware

           ‘Before, a woman, a man, a little son,...’ (T/JK:KG05V5.27)    The quantifier ndu can function as a coreferential pronoun in left dislocation
constructions; see (103) and (105). See also: §5.3.3.1 and §6.4.2 concerning com-
binations of ndu with interrogatives; examples (299) - (301), showing NPs in which
ndu occurs in combination with -na SPEC to indicate ‘contrastive identity’; and
§6.4.2 concerning uses of ndu in place phrases.","[167, 168]"

3.9     Interrogatives
Interrogatives are words that occur in questions to “indicate either all by themselves,
or with the help of syntactic features of the question in which they occur, which
part of the proposition the the asker is interested in knowing about” (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985:185), and thus typically (although not necessarily) delineate a gap in
speaker knowledge. Duna sentences that include an interrogative word are defined
as interrogative sentences (§11.1.3.5).
    Duna interrogatives split into two groups, non-derived and derived. Non-derived
interrogatives cannot be productively composed from extant morphemes (although
in most cases the forms suggest that they were originally compositional). Derived
interrogatives are formed from the interrogative root pa- ‘query’ in combination
with a bound morpheme, for example an NP marker.
  28
    An exception to this is sakore ‘quietly, slowly, gently’, which in one instance in the textual data
occurs with the iterative medial verb inflection, -rua (ITER).
92                                                                   Chapter 3. Word classes
                             Table 3.18 Interrogatives (non-derived)                             Form            Approximate meaning

                             akita           ‘how many’
                             pania           ‘which’
                             paneki          ‘when’
                             pano            ‘where is’
                             paneme(ta)      ‘how/why’    Table 3.18 shows known non-derived interrogatives. Schachter (1985:34) notes
that “[t]he set of interrogative pro-forms typically cuts across other part-of-speech
classes” and this is the case in Duna. For example, the interrogatives ai ‘who’
and aki ‘what’ are pronominal and occur in NPs (§5.3.3), whereas the interrogative
pro-form paneki ‘when’ stands for a temporal expression (380). Several of the non-
derived interrogatives have formal similarities and are almost certainly historically
related. For example akita ‘how many’ appears to be based on (or at least share an
etymology with) aki ‘what’.29 The words paneki, pania, pano and paneme probably
include the interrogative pa- (or a forebear of it).30
    The interrogative root pa- ‘query’ is formally most similar to a directional or loc-
ational demonstrative (§3.7), as it shares several distributional properties with these
classes (but does not exactly match the distributional properties of either). The kind
of missing information that pa- stands for will depend on the bound marker that
follows it and the syntactic context in which it occurs. Table 3.19 shows the dif-
ferent bound forms that are known to combine with pa-, the approximate meaning
of the resultant expression, and the section of this thesis where this expression is
discussed.
    An example of a phrase that functions similarly to an interrogative is the expres-
sion aki wata, ‘why?’, ‘what’s the reason?’. This is composed of the interrogative
form aki ‘what’ and the consonantal verb wa- ‘do’ inflected with the sequential
medial inflection -ta, so that it literally means something like ‘what happened and
then..?’. The hesitation pro-form apoko(ne), ‘whatchmacallit’ (§5.3.3.5) is similar
to an interrogative pro-form in that it stands for an unknown item. However this
does not function as interrogative, but acts as a filler while the speaker is trying to
remember a word, typically a nominal constituent.
  29
      Cochrane and Cochrane (1966:20) also note the existence of an interrogative akinda ‘how’. This
form does not occur in the 2003-7 data.
   30
      For example, the word paneme ‘how’ may be derived from morphemes that are related to the
currently productive forms pa- ‘query’, -ne ‘TYPE’, and -me ‘MNR’. However -ne and -me do not
otherwise co-occur.

The forms angu ‘only, just’ (glossed as ‘RESTRICT’) and kone ‘truly, very, really’

can modify nominal phrase constituents, verbs, temporals and manner adverbs.
The form angu typically modifies nominal phrases. These forms are phonological
words, but do not occur as independent utterances. I treat these words as part of the
constituent which they modify, and they are not further discussed in this thesis, but
can be observed in many of the example sentences.","[120, 121, 122]"

     The ailment nouns siki ‘sickness’ and malaria ‘malaria, (fever, sickness)’ are clearly derived
from English/Tok Pisin. I assume that the constructions using the two new terms are based upon
an original construction, naki sa-. Haley (2002:111) reports that khenekene was originally used to
refer to influenza (§1.1.3); it appears to be derived from a reduplication of the nominal/verbal root

in some expressions the ailment noun (or NP) occupies the P participant slot that is
subcategorised for by the bivalent verb that it occurs with, and is an object NP.
    Firstly, it can be seen that although one can view the ailment as affecting the
experiencer, it is not the subject of the bivalent verb in the construction. Examples
(614) and (615) show different uses of the noun malaria. In (614), malaria heads a
subject NP in an ordinary bivalent clause headed by the verb kole- ‘break, split’. The
NP is marked as a contrasted subject with the morpheme -ka. Example (615a) shows
the noun malaria occurring with the verb sa- ‘take, get’ as part of an ailment+verb
predication. It is not the subject of the clause and cannot be CS-marked, as shown
in (615b).","[289, 290]"
"5.4.1   Collocation: detailing pair and group members
Individual members of pairs and groups can be denoted by adjacent nominals or
NPs. Two nominals may be tightly bound and operate as a single constituent (a
‘pair compound NP’), or adjacent NPs may be more loosely bound and understood
as ‘collocated’ through a conventionalised principle of interpretation, in combina-
tion with distinct intonation (‘listing construction’). Prototypically, these two kinds
of collocation have several distinct identifying features, but they are not entirely
discrete structural types; it is more appropriate to think of adjacent referring expres-
sions as being more or less bound rather than strictly one or the other.
160                                      Chapter 5. Constituents of nominal phrases
5.4.1.1    Pair compound NPs (tight collocation)
Prototypical features of pair compound NPs are: they include two adjacent nom-
inals that make up a single intonation unit with no discernible pause after the first
nominal; there is morphological group or pair marking (§6.3.2.2, §6.3.3) as for a
single NP; and other bound forms such as role-marking markers or dependent pro-
nouns are applied as for a single NP constituent. Examples (235) - (237) typify pair
compound NPs.(235)     wi       yawi-ne stori ndu ha-na.
          tree.game dog-PR story one there-SPEC

          son   mother -SHRD-PR tree.var -SHRD-LOC ascend ascend-DEP go-DEP
          ‘This mother and son, they climbed away up the ayake tree...’
          (T/JK:KG05V5.27)    In examples such as (237) the pair compound NP is functionally equivalent to
a dyadic kin term. Such terms are present in one of Duna’s neighbours, Oksapmin
(Loughnane 2008).
    In example (238), the paired nominals are the same word. This can be inter-
preted as a complex repeated nominal (§5.2.1.4), comprising a simple NP that is
marked for pairhood (§6.3.3), or a pair compound NP.(238)     sakore sia     sia-ne-ta       ndu-ka retoro si-ya...

          (T/IH:NH03T6A)5.4.1.2    Listing construction (loose collocation)
Prototypical features of a listing construction include: it occurs at the beginning of
a sentence; has an intonation pattern such that each NP is a distinct intonation unit;
shows parallelism across members, for example, each NP is similarly marked as
definite or otherwise; either none or all of the NPs in the list are marked with a pair
or group marker; and the list is followed by a nominal phrase that is an umbrella
term for all the pair/group members (for example, a plural pronoun), and that bears
NP-final morphology as relevant (for example, contrasted subject marking).
    Two examples that typify the listing construction are shown in (239) and (240).

          (T/JK:KG05V5.27)   Verbal clauses headed by an existential verb marked with the general dependent
verb inflection -ya (DEP) can also be used in a listing construction. An example is
shown in (241). It is typical for the last clause in the chain to be marked with the
sequential medial inflection -ta (SEQ) following -ya, as in this example.(241)     no ka-ya            Juli ka-ya         Monika ka-ya-ta,                inu     Hagen

Many collocations in the textual data show features of both tight and loose bind-
ing. Two adjacent NPs that are each group or pair-marked (that is, are characteristic
of listing construction) generally also show some pair compound NP features. Ex-
ample (242) shows two adjacent NPs marked with the group marker -tia, and an
intonation break after the first NP. These are features of listing constructions. How-
ever, the collocated group is not clause-initial and is not followed by an umbrella
term. Example (243) shows the same pattern, with each collocated NP marked with
-ne ‘PR’.(242)     ka,     hina-tia, ta-tia ruka ki-ya                nga-ta...

    Similarly, in (244) adjacent NPs are marked with -ne and and there is an inton-
ation break after the first pair member. However, the dual pronoun that follows the
two NPs is not preceded by a pause and in this respect sounds like a dependent pro-
noun (§6.6.3), not an independent ‘umbrella’ pronoun. This is more characteristic
of tight binding, that is, NP-final morphology occurs as for a single nominal phrase.(244)     wi          Andatia-ne, wi             Yawuna-ne =kheno ra-o.

trasted subjecthood with -ka (§6.6.1). Marking the individual NPs separately was
judged unacceptable (KK).","[188, 189, 190, 191]"
"1.3.3.2    Notebook data
I use the term ‘notebook data’ to refer to language data that I recorded in written
form only. The bulk of the notebook data is material collected during more formal
elicitation sessions, that is, where I worked closely with a single speaker or a few
speakers to investigate a particular topic in Duna grammar or vocabulary, within
an explicit context of writing language down. (As with translation of textual data,
such investigation was typically done using Tok Pisin and some English.) I des-
ignate language data that I received during such sessions as ‘ED’ (elicited data).
However some ED examples are less formally ‘elicited’ that others. For example,
during more casual conversations (or sometimes out of the blue), speakers would
often suggest appropriate things for me to say to fit a certain real-life situation, or
extemporise sentences that showed how to use a particular vocabulary item. These
more spontaneous or natural language kinds of examples are also indexed as ‘ED’.
    I use the letters ‘CD’ (for ‘constructed data’) to mark those examples that I
constructed during elicitation sessions, typically for the purpose of obtaining gram-
maticality, sense, or pragmatic judgements concerning the example’s viability as an
utterance.
    Three further kinds of notebook data that I distinguish are ‘learner conversa-
tion’ (LC), ‘corrected conversation’ (CC) and ‘overheard speech’ (OH). ‘LC’ marks
examples from Duna conversations in which I was included as one of the conver-
sational participants, that is, replies or comments made with me as listener. ‘CC’
  34
     Exceptions to this process are the texts of speakers Apokas Mbuli and Irari Hipuya, which were
transcribed and translated (into Tok Pisin/English) by Kenny Kendoli and Richard Alo.
1.3. Fieldwork and language data                                                                 25
includes Duna speakers’ corrected or improved versions of an utterance I had just
made in conversation. ‘OH’ indicates the example is (a fragment of) overheard
Duna speech; unusual or complex examples have (unless otherwise stated) been
checked subsequently to make sure that I heard and interpreted them correctly. 351.3.3.3    Other data
The data also includes some short texts that were independently written by Duna
speakers and then given to me by their authors. These are designated ‘WD’ for
‘written data’.
    At some points in this thesis I reproduce Duna sentences from Giles (MSa), in
which case citation details are included after the translation line.36 Giles provides
English sentence translations of Duna examples (except in practice exercises), but
does not commonly add any interlinear gloss or indicate word-internal morpheme
boundaries. Where I include examples taken from Giles’ materials in this thesis, the
translation is supplied by Giles and the interlinear gloss supplied by myself, unless
otherwise indicated.","[53, 54]"
"1.2.2    Tok Pisin and English in the Duna community
In the Lake Kopiago area, Duna is the primary language in all domestic settings
and in most public domains (for example, at the market, in court sessions, com-
munity meetings). Children learn Duna as their first language, and many people I
met (especially older women and younger children) are apparently monolingual in
Duna. On occasions where I witnessed an outsider in Lake Kopiago making pub-
lic speeches (or suchlike) in Tok Pisin and/or English, their words would typically
be translated into Duna by a self-appointed interpreter.20 Similarly, in church ser-
vices that I attended the preacher would sometimes read from a Tok Pisin Bible, but
would then ‘translate’ the passage immediately into Duna (sometimes producing an
interpretation with additional commentary rather than a straight literal translation).
    Tok Pisin ((Neo-)Melanesian Pidgin) is the major lingua franca throughout at
least the northern half of mainland PNG, and is also widely used in the National
Capital District. It is an official national language of the country, along with English
and Hiri Motu. Tok Pisin is primarily used in the Duna community to communicate
with outsiders (that is, those who do not speak Duna); see also §1.2.3 concerning
the school setting. Most people in the Kopiago area appear to have at least some
familiarity with Tok Pisin.21 This familiarity ranges from full fluency, to passive
comprehension but low production competence, to knowledge of a few vocabulary
items and structures (for example, common nouns, imperative sentences). The level
of competence typically reflects whether and for how long someone has spent time
outside of the Duna community in areas where Tok Pisin is used as a major language
of communication (for example, urban centres such as Mount Hagen). Fluent Tok
Pisin speakers are typically men between the ages of about 25 and 60, who are likely
to have spent periods outside of Duna territory looking for adventure and employ-
ment. People with very limited competence are (as already intimated in the previous
example, in the New Testament orthography, a voiceless velar stop is represented as ‘g’. This is
problematic for Duna people with some literacy in Tok Pisin who have had no training in the Duna
orthography, as their expectation is that this symbol will be associated with a prenasalised voiced
velar stop. People respond to these kinds of problems by divining that what is written is not actually
‘our language’, but that of the south-eastern, Huli-like, Duna. It appears that the current orthographic
and educational situation in the Lake Kopiago region (i.e., a severe lack of consistent training and
institutional support for vernacular literacy educators, see §1.2.3) is incorporated into a mutually
re-enforcing relationship with the trope of the north-west/south-east Duna divide.
   20
      However, see also Haley’s description of a significant meeting between Duna people and tele-
communications officials where this was not the case. Haley comments that particular older, more
knowledgeable men were effectively excluded from taking part in this discussion as it was conducted
in Tok Pisin.
   21
      See also Gillespie (2007b) concerning the use of Tok Pisin in songs.
1.2. Duna language                                                                              15
paragraph) typically older women or young children. Stürzenhofecker (1998:118)
notes that women in Aluni have “very limited knowledge of the lingua franca”.22
Differing levels of Tok Pisin competence according to gender (men having higher
competence than women) is a typical pattern in rural settings in much of Papua New
Guinea (Foley 1986:37).
    In the 2003-5 textual data (§1.3.3.1) there are several instances of speakers us-
ing a Tok Pisin-derived form as a replacement for a Duna form; see, for example,
(77), where the speaker uses the Tok Pisin-derived siriki rather than the Duna verb
adjunct ho to mean ‘trick’. Although the speakers I worked with on transcription
and translation would typically ‘correct’ a Tok Pisin-derived form to the Duna equi-
valent, I did not generally hear people express a great deal of anxiety concerning
the encroachment of Tok Pisin on their language. Adults who are fluent Tok Pisin
speakers encourage children to learn this language, and this aim is seen by at least
some parents or guardians as a good reason to take a child traveling to town areas.
     People recognise the value of English for obtaining paid employment, but have
little opportunity to learn it and little or no application for it in their daily lives.
During my time in the field I did not hear Duna people using English amongst
themselves, beyond the occasional adoption of a word or phrase, and few Duna
people living in the Kopiago region have a high level of competence in the lan-
guage.23 Such skills are typically only gained through education at a level that is
not available in Lake Kopiago, and generally those who can speak good English
seek work outside the Duna community.","[43, 44]"
"6.4.3   Multiple areas -kuru
The place phrase marker -kuru marks a phrase that refers to multiple areas, describ-
ing a group of like settings.27 Examples are shown in (366) - (368).(366)    hina khei [anda manda manda -ra-kuru]                      ke-ya-roko...

  26
      I assume that in this example Sipiki is a separate object NP (the P argument of mbite- ‘cross
river’), not part of the place phrase.
   27
      Unlike -ka, -kuru does not occur following ndu. I assume this is because their semantic spe-
cifications are at odds, that is, ndu is semantically singular and -kuru is non-singular.
196                                                Chapter 6. NP, PP, and PlcP morphology
    There are no examples in my data of -kuru combining with the interrogative pa-
‘query’ to form an interrogative meaning ‘what places?’ (or similar). However,
the form pa-kuru does occur in the textual data in a specialised construction that
is used to describe mysterious or extraordinary places, typically those that are the
realm of pikono narrative (§1.3.3.1) and can never be known by people in ordinary,
everyday way. Pakuru follows a verbal clause (predication ‘X’) in a phrase that
means something like ‘places where X happens’. Two examples are shown in (369)
and (370).28 In (369), the speaker describes how a woman in a story (who has
wandered off, flouting the express orders of her brother) is charmed by a water spirit
and led down into his mysterious world of underground rivers (see Haley 2002). In
(370), the hero of a pikono story takes leave of his beautiful female companion,
going off on a journey of his own into distant regions of the pikono world.(369)    siri ndu kho hoa-ta           ho-na        salo      ka-ta           si-ya-ta         ipa

         (P/KY:KG05)6.4.4    Other ways of denoting locations
In this section I describe some further kinds of referring expressions that denote
times and places, in order to give a fuller picture of how description of spatial and
temporal locations can be included in a clause.
  28
     I find this construction difficult to analyse, and to do so would require a more comprehensive
analysis of Duna (including further examination of complex sentences) than is attempted in this
thesis. However, I believe it is suggestive of a relationship between the interrogative root pa and
the ‘individual standpoint’ marker pa that occurs as a verbal inflection (§9.3.2.1). Briefly, it makes
sense to interpret the interrogative root ‘query’ and the predicate marker ‘INDV’ as (deriving from)
a single form pa which is concerned with not knowing. This is commensurate with the occurrence
of forms such as -ra ‘SHRD’ as both an epistemic demonstrative and a predicate marker. The inter-
rogative function of pa (‘query’) relates to the epistemic demonstrative function of forms such as
-ra, and indicates that the referent of a phrase is not known (specifically, not known to the speaker
but assumed to be known to the addressee). When it marks a final predicate, pa (INDV) indicates
that the speaker knows about the predicated activity, but assumes that this is individual knowledge,
not necessarily shared by the addressee. Examples such as (369) and (370) give a window into a
situation where pa is exploited as: a form that is demonstrative-like, as it is followed by the place
phrase marker -kuru in a referring expression; and a marker that affixes to a verb root in a clause that
describes an ‘unknown’ situation.

6.4.4.1    Locational demonstratives and -nga ‘EXCV’
The bound form -nga occurs on personal pronouns (§6.6.2) and the locational demon-
strative roots ho ‘here’ and ha ‘there’. Its generalised meaning concerns emphatic
and exclusive identification of a referent.
    Locational demonstratives that are marked with -nga reference locations that
are exclusively identified as ‘exactly here’ (honga) or ‘exactly there’ (hanga). Ex-
amples are shown in (371) and (372).(371)     inu   ho-nga       waki-ya ra-o.

          ‘You have brought something to the house right here.’ (T/YS:270205)6.4.4.2    Time marker -ngi
The bound morpheme -ngi (TIME) occurs on words or phrases that describe the tem-
poral setting of the predicate. This marker can be viewed as somewhat equivalent
to a PlcP marker, used in the formation of a special kind of phrase (a ‘time phrase’)
that occurs only as an adjunct expression in the clause. However there is insufficient
data at present to be able to describe a general template for such a phrase.
    The time marker is attested occurring on common nouns, adjectives, and loca-
tional or class II epistemic demonstratives (examples shown in (374) - (377)), and
(rarely) on two-word phrases as in (378) (see also (389)). In some combinations -ngi
appears to be only minimally productive, occurring in fixed idiomatic expressions.(374)     ho-yarua-ngi       elekota ruwa-ta ndu se             neya-o.

  29
     Note that anda ‘house’ is not marked as locative so cannot be interpreted as a separate NP that
references a goal or location. Rather, it is part of phrase that finishes with honga.

probably represents a conventionalised use of the temporal marker rather than pro-
ductive application of it.
    There is one example in the data (379) of the temporal marker -ngi occurring
in combination with the interrogative pa-. Pa-ngi seems to express an indefinite
time (‘sometime’), but further data are required to test this. Example (379) is taken
from a pikono narrative; at this point in the story the hero is teasing a host of young
women who are keen to come and spend time with him. He has told them that he
can’t be with them now, but that one day in the future they will see signs that a big
party is about to happen and they should come then.(379)    ha     pa-ngi        warama pana-ta            wa-no        ri-tia-e

(380). The temporal interrogative is not productively compositional, although it
bears a clear relation to the productive interrogative root pa (as well as having a
final syllable that is suggestively similar to -ngi).(380)    ko antia paneki hutia.

    ‘Sweet potato time’ is contrasted with specific periods that are defined by the availability of wild

6.4.4.3    Territory marker -li
The bound form -li (TERR) occurs on locational and directional demonstratives,
forming a word that refers to a place. In all noted examples the place is a region that
is occupied by a distinct cultural/linguistic group, suggesting that -li is a ‘country’
or ‘territory’ designator.31 However, -li is rare in the textual data and the scope of
its application (both formally and semantically) is not known. Two examples are
shown in (381) and (382).

          ‘Once from here [i.e., Duna territory], I went without stopping, I went to

    Some other occurrences of -li include use of roma-li (‘above-TERR’) to refer
to the Mt Hagen area, and sopa-li (‘below-TERR’) to refer to the low-altitude Bo-
gaia/Yeru region (§1.1.2).32
    The morpheme -li is akin to the place phrase markers -ka and -kuru as it forms a
place-referent expression based on a demonstrative root. However, it is unlike these
markers in that it has only ever been observed to mark a single lexeme, never a
phrasal constituent, and does not precisely share PlcP marker distributional restric-
tions, as it does not occur on Class II epistemic demonstratives, and can occur on
locational demonstratives.
    According to a conversation I had with PK, it is perfectly sensible to add -li
‘TERR’ to the interrogative pa- ‘query’. Unfortunately I did not record the meaning
of pali, and there are no examples of this word in the textual data. I assume that it
means something like ‘which territory/country?’.
6.4.4.4    Morphologically unmarked oblique NPs
Certain kinds of NPs can occur as place-referent adjuncts in a clause without overt
marking as to their semantic role and oblique relation. These include NPs that con-
sist of: a placename only; a word formed with -(a)nda ‘enclosure, shelter, dwelling’
  31
      The Huli-English Dictionary (Rule and unknown collaborators 1971) records a Huli suffix -ali
‘tribe’ and this is perhaps a related form.
   32
      KK and RA suggested that, based upon observing latitude relationships on maps of the world,
sopa-li could also be used to refer to Australia, and eto-li to refer to the USA. I do not know if this is
common practice. The sequence li also occurs in some placenames (e.g., Ekali (Ekali/Agali, SHP),
previously Yeru territory and now occupied by Bogaia people), and this may be a related form.
200                                               Chapter 6. NP, PP, and PlcP morphology
or -yaki ‘side’ (§5.2.1.2); or a locational or directional demonstrative that is marked
with -na ‘SPEC’ and functions as a pro-form for a particular (endophorically or
exophorically identifiable) place.
    Examples (383) - (386) show NPs that consist of a placename. A nominal phrase
headed by a common noun would be overtly marked as a location or goal-like entity
in clauses predicated by existential or motion verbs; see, for example, (314) and
(319) in §6.3.4.2. However, an NP that consists of a placename typically is not.
Such words are inherently place-referent and their relationship to the predicate can
be assumed.33(383)    inu    Kalipopo ra-o.

         ‘I took sick at Mt Hagen.’ (CD/XIV:166)    In examples (387) and (388) the NP consists of a word formed with the ‘enclos-
ure’ morpheme -(a)nda and no further marking is used.(387)    hatia-nda yapa-lu ua-na=nia                        ri-tia.

  33
      In some cases it is alternatively possible to argue that unmarked NPs are arguments that are
semantically required by the predicate, and that this is the reason they are realised as unmarked.
Whilst it is certainly true that NPs that I analyse as unmarked obliques typically occur with motion
and existential verbs (i.e., those verbs for which it would be quite sensible to argue for subcategor-
ised location or goal-like arguments), the ‘core argument’ interpretation does not account for the
acceptability of sentences such as (385) and (386). In these examples the placenames Hakene and
Yerikuru are unmarked NPs, but there is no obvious reason why the predicates in these clauses would
‘require’ a place-like argument.
   34
      This place name appears to include the ‘place group’ marker -kuru as a fossilised form.
6.5. Role-marking postpositions                                                    201
    Example (389) shows two unmarked oblique NPs that consist of a demonstrative
marked with -na ‘SPEC’. Context makes their place-referent function clear because
the sentence is about two known individuals who live at different places and thus
are not able to meet easily; sopa-na ‘the below one’ is understood to refer to the
place Ekali (the low-altitude Bogaia settlement in the Strickland Gorge), and hona
‘the here one’ is understood to refer to Rewapi-Hirane (where the sentence is being
spoken).(389)   ko pi     sopa-na      ra-ya,      no pi   ho-na    rei-na,

        ‘She’s at the below one [Ekali], I’m at this one [Hirane], I’ll only see her at

to Aluni, a Duna area that is lower than Hirane (but higher and closer than Ekali,
referred to in 389). This example is the answer to a question as to where the speaker
(met on the road) is coming from. In this case other relevant context is that the
speaker has close land and family ties in Aluni and travels there often; Aluni is thus
the most salient ‘below one’ in this conversational situation.(390)   sopa-na     ko            hoa-ya.

        ‘I am coming from the below one [i.e., from Aluni].’ (CED)    Unmarked potentially referential temporals such as day-terms (see for example
hata ‘yesterday’ in (404)) can also be understood as unmarked ‘circumstantial’ ob-
lique NPs (§4.2.2.2). Referential temporals are nominal-like, but are almost entirely
constrained by their meaning to occur as adjunct expressions in the clause; the ma-
jor function of a word that denotes a period of time will be to describe the temporal
setting of a predicated activity.","[224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230]"
"3.2     Nominals
A prototypical semantic property of members of a ‘nominal’ word class is that
they refer to ‘time stable’ concepts (Schachter 1985:6) and designate objects (Evans
2000:710), for example persons and places.
    Duna nominal roots can constitute complete nominal phrases (NPs) by them-
selves, and typically occur in NPs that denote participants in a described event or
relationship (Chapter 5). NPs can also occur as predicates (§4.1.1.1), but unlike
predicating verbs, nominals cannot be marked with TAM markers (§8.2) or the neg-
ative circumfix (§8.3). Nominal predicates can however be marked with (a restricted
range of) epistemic assessment markers (§10.3).
    I divide Duna nominals into three subclasses: common nouns (§3.2.1), proper
names (§3.2.2), and personal pronouns (§3.2.3). The former two groups are open
classes, to which new members may be added. Personal pronouns comprise a small
closed class. See also §3.9 concerning quasi-nominal interrogative forms.",[99]
"11.1.3     Interrogative and speculative
11.1.3.1    Introduction
Sadock and Zwicky distinguish the interrogative sentence type generally as that
which “signal[s] the desire of the speaker to gain information from the addressee”
(1985:156). I define Duna interrogative sentences as those that contain an interrog-
ative word (§3.9)4 and/or the interrogative marker =pe (§11.1.3.2). They are derived
from declarative or optative sentences; in this section I exemplify interrogatives that
are derived from declarative sentences only, including three basic structures: yes-no
interrogatives (§11.1.3.3), alternative interrogatives (§11.1.3.4), and question word
interrogatives (§11.1.3.5).
    Interrogative sentences typically function as questions. In prototypical question
situations the speaker: does not know something (or does not know it for sure),
expects the addressee does know it, and asks the addressee to tell them this inform-
ation (or to confirm it). In some situations an interrogative sentence can be used
as a ‘rhetorical’ question, for which an answer is not expected. The speaker does
not ask the addressee to fill a gap in his or her knowledge, but may use an inter-
rogative to convey an attitude (for example, surprise, criticism) towards a situation,
and/or draw the addressee’s attention to something (see, for example, (222)-(224)
in §5.3.3.2).
   This section also describes a further minor sentence type, the ‘speculative’ (§11.1.3.6).
This type is defined on the basis of final predicate morphology, comprising those
   4
     A possible exception to this is where interrogative words appear to be used in construction with
other morphemes as indefinite pronominals (see example (360)). Too few examples exist in the data
to pursue this issue further.
11.1. Overview of sentence types                                                             415
sentences that are marked with the uncertainty maker -rape (§9.3.3.2), or the epi-
stemic particles =koae and =nokoae (§10.4.3). In these cases the marker =pe also
occurs, but is not really productively applied, as in the case of -rape it is represented
as a frozen component of the morpheme, and in the case of (no)koae is basically a
required element of independent use of these forms (unless an interrogative word
is present in the sentence). Speculative sentences are like interrogative sentences
in that the speaker expresses ignorance of the proposition, and encourages the ad-
dressee to have a look at what they know about it. However, unlike typical contexts
of interrogative sentences there is little expectation that the addressee knows the
answer and will be able to respond definitively.","[443, 444]"
"4.2.3.1       Reflexive clauses
A clause with reflexive semantics describes a situation in which something acts
upon itself, fulfilling both the actor and undergoer participant roles required by a
bivalent predicate.13 As far as I am aware Duna does not have a distinct formal
construction that is specifically reserved for this kind of situation. In certain cases,
a clause can be identifed as reflexive, but this is a semantic rather than morpho-
syntactic label.
    Examples (72) and (73) show clauses headed by the complex predicate waya
sa- ‘wash’. This predicate can head a clause with non-reflexive meaning (72), or
reflexive meaning (73).
  13
       I have no data regarding reflexive trivalent clauses.
110                                                    Chapter 4. Basic clause structure

          1SG baby     wash take.PFV
          ‘I washed the baby’ (ED/V:27) (73) ko waya so-wei.
          2SG wash take-PROHIB
          ‘Don’t wash [yourself]!’ (ED/VII:23)    I analyse NPs such as the pronoun ko ‘2SG’ in (73) as subject NPs that are under-
stood to ‘stand for’ both the actor and undergoer participants that are required by the
predicate. The semantics of the predicate, the lack of any overt P argument, exclus-
ivity marking (see following) and/or emphatic double pronoun reference (§5.4.2.3)
generate a strong implication of reflexive meaning.
    A subject NP in a semantically reflexive clause is likely to be an ‘exclusive’
nominal phrase, that is, a pronominal NP marked with the exclusive identification
marker -nga ‘EXCV’ (§6.6.2). This reference strategy indicates that an A or S argu-
ment acts solely by, for, and/or upon themselves or their possessions,14 and is not
restricted to reflexive clauses. An example of a reflexive clause that includes an NP
marked with -nga is shown in (74). The example shown in (75) can be considered
reflexive or not, depending on whether one includes in the definition that actor and
undergoer can be in a whole-part relationship rather than completely co-identified. (74) no-nga         sa-ta      khene-nda.

          1SG-EXCV 1SG hand/arm axe-INSTR cut-PFV
          ‘I cut my hand with an axe.’ (CED/VIII:184)4.2.3.2    Reciprocal clauses
Examples (76) and (77) show clauses headed by bivalent predicates that describe
semantically reciprocal events. Two entities perform the same predicated activity
upon each other and so correspond to both the actor and undergoer participants
required by the predicate, as they simultaneously ‘do’ and ‘be done unto’. In (76)
and (77), the clause includes a single NP that refers to both participants; this is
typical of semantically reciprocal clauses that occur in the Duna textual data. Verbs
that describe a reciprocal activity are usually marked by a morphological operation
which indicates multiple instantiations of the predicate, that is, reduplication (full
or partial) of the root and/or the iterative affix -(r)uri (§7.2.3), as in both of these
examples. Such marking is not exclusive to clauses with reciprocal meaning.
  14
    KK and RA felt that use of -nga was most appropriate for situations involving high animacy
possessions, such as children and domestic animals.
4.2. Participant reference in verbal clauses                                                         111

          ‘The pair would trick each other...’ (T/HY:201003ii)    Example (78) shows a clause with reciprocal meaning that is headed by a trivalent
predicate, the complex lexeme ngirane ngirane-, meaning ‘exchange’.15 In this con-
struction the givers and recipients are in a reciprocal relationship, and correspond
to a single NP, the dual pronoun keno. (78)     keno ngalipe ngirane ngirane-o.
          1DL peanut.lw exchange exchange-PFV
          ‘We two exchanged peanuts (with each other).’ (CED/VII:8)    As for reflexive subjects, I interpret unmarked NPs such as those that occur in
(76) - (78) as subject NPs that stand for both the actor and undergoer participants
that are required by the predicate, or, in the case of a trivalent predicate, for both the
givers and recipients. Overtly marking a nominal phrase such as keno in (78) as a
contrasted subject triggers a slightly different reading of the clause, in which an R
argument NP is assumed to have been elided.16 (79)     kena-ka ngalipe ngirane ngirane-o.
          1DL-CS peanut exchange exchange-PFV
          ‘We two (as a pair) exchanged peanuts (with other people).’ (CED/VII:8)    In the constructed example shown in (80), each participant is referenced by
a separate NP. I believe this is best interpreted as a ‘collocated’ NP construction
(§5.4.1), that is, with anoa ndu and ima ndu being collocated as a multi-referent
subject argument rather than representing distinct A and P arguments.17 (80)     anoa ndu ima          ndu rembo rembo-ya rei.
          man one woman one stare             stare-DEP be/sit.STAT
          ‘A man and a woman are sitting staring at each other.’ (CD/V:70)
  15
      This is presumably derived from the trivalent verb ngua- ‘give’ and the sequential (switch)
medial inflection -rane, although as far as I am aware this morphological template is not productive.
   16
      It is alternatively possible to use contrasted subject marking as an indication of contrastive focus
in reciprocal clauses, for example, to emphasise that out of a group of potential participants, it was
X and Y in particular who engaged in a reciprocal activity; see §5.4.2.3.
   17
      The collocation analysis seems the most sensible interpretation because encoding the parti-
cipants of a reciprocal activity as one NP is the usual pattern in the textual data.
112                                                  Chapter 4. Basic clause structure
    Example (81) shows another constructed clause in which the verb is reduplic-
ated, and two NPs are present; however, in this case the first is marked as a contras-
ted subject. KK thought that the most likely interpretation for this clause was that
a cat or cats scratched other cats, but that reciprocal semantics were not strongly
implied. The first NP, puti nduka (‘a cat’ or ‘each cat’), is interpreted as an A argu-
ment, the second, ndu (‘one’), as a P argument. Reduplication of the verb indicates
multiple instantiations of the predicate activity, triggering the reading that there are
several P arguments, and possibly also several A arguments. (81) phuti ndu-ka ndu hara-ra-tia.

          ‘A/Each cat scratched others.’ (CD)4.2.3.3    Argument elision
Predicate arguments are not obligatorily realised as NPs in the clause, but may be
covertly ‘referenced’ through zero anaphora. A lack of any overt reference signals
to a listener that they should identify the ‘missing’ argument as a participant that
has already been referred to in the preceding discourse, or can be inferred from
exophoric context.
    Example (82) shows an elided S argument, the identity of which is understood
from exophoric context. This was a comment made by a child upon seeing an
elephant in a film; the S argument of the clause is clearly understood to be this
unfamiliar animal. (82)           ho-li      hoa-na=pe.
                here-TERR come-PROPH=Q
          ‘Will [that animal] come here?’ (OH)    Example (83) shows a clause headed by the trivalent verb ngua- ‘give’ in which
the A, R, and T arguments are not overt. This utterance was called out by an audi-
ence member during a pikono performance. The previous few minutes of the per-
formance have been devoted to describing how one of the heroes of the story has
killed and cooked numerous pigs for a feast, and detailing the guests that he is now
giving food to. All of the participants can thus be inferred from the context of the
narrative. (83)                   ngi-ku-rape
                        give-EXHAUST-UNC
          ‘Maybe [he] has given [all the guests] [all the meat].’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).4))    The text excerpt shown in (84) exemplifies text-based zero anaphoric reference
of an S/A argument that is maintained across several clauses. Each line is a clausal
4.2. Participant reference in verbal clauses                                                     113
unit,18 commas indicating rising intonation followed by a pause, and full stops
indicating falling intonation followed by a pause. The subject of the first clause
shown, (84a), is realised as an NP, no ‘1SG’ (shown in bold). This participant (the
speaker) is maintained as a subject argument across seven subsequent clauses. Hori-
zontal dashed lines in the Duna text represent the gapped argument.19 Identification
of the missing argument is supported in a number of ways, for example: there are
no other participants mentioned that could potentially occur as arguments of these
predicates; the gapped argument is highly animate, and thus a good candidate for
‘topical continuity’ (Givón 1983); most of the predicates are monovalent, so there
is no potential for ambiguity or misidentification of an argument position; and four
of the clauses completely or partially repeat the predicate of the preceding clause.
When a different subject argument is introduced in (84i), this participant is overtly
referenced as a nominal phrase. The medial verbal inflection that precedes this
clause, -roko, also strongly predicts (but does not absolutely determine) that S or A
argument identity is about to change. (84)     a. no waya sa-ya            ngo.

"9.2.5     Results evidential markers
9.2.5.1    Introduction
The results evidence morphemes mark events that are primarily experienced through
their observable results. Typically these results constitute visible evidence, such as
footprints or burnt remains, from which the informant infers that the event has taken
place. KK and RA succinctly defined the primary meaning of these morphemes as
‘to look and know’.20
    The results evidence markers are only suitable for marking events that have (or
are inferred to have) occurred and been completed before the time of utterance.21
The resultative evidence morphemes are functionally akin to a perfect aspectual
value (and may, in the case of the regular morphemes, derive from a perfect aspect
serialisation construction), as they indicate the presence of a resultant state that
follows an event.22 This is particularly evident in clauses headed by regular verbs.
  20
      This definition also highlights the fact that the resultative evidence category does not necessarily
imply a lack of certainty on the part of the informant that the event took place.
   21
      Note that is not the case that the idea of inference itself is logically limited to completed past
events, as it is also possible to observe evidence and infer that something will happen or is happening.
However these kinds of inference are not drawn from specifically resultative material.
   22
      See Comrie (1976:108-10) and Aikhenvald (2004) for further comments on the relationship
between perfect aspect and indirect information source evidentiality categories, and Johansen and
Utas (2000) for discussion of this relationship in particular Turkic and Iranian (and neighbouring)
languages.

    Results evidence markers in statements are added to the o-base of consonantal
verbs (including ra- ‘sit’), the i-base of wa-class verbs,23 and the i-base or a-base of
partial wa-class members.
    In terms of attested cross-linguistic evidential categories, the Duna results evid-
ential category most closely resembles the ‘Results’ category as defined by Willett
(1988) and the ‘Inference’ category as defined by Aikhenvald (2004).","[351, 352]"
"1.3.3.4    Summary of data types
A key to the datatypes that are indicated in example sentences (and referred to else-
where in the thesis text) is shown in Table 1.3. Data type designations are shown in
parentheses following the translation of an example, preceding further information
that indexes the particular source text. For example, when ‘(P/AM:NH03T12A)’
follows the English translation, the initial ‘P’ shows that this example is taken from
a sung pikono text. The following two letters represent the speaker, and ‘NH’ shows
that this text was recorded in audio form by Nicole Haley. The remainder of the des-
ignation details the year and tape of Haley’s recording.
    In certain cases, data represents a combination of types. For example, there are
some texts that start off as straightforward ‘T’ narratives, but shift into the ‘Learner
Interview’ category as I start to ask questions of the speaker about their story. Some
sentences in the notebook data may be a mix of constructed and elicited material,
for example in situations where I have constructed the first half of a sentence and
asked a speaker to finish it off. Where I judge that two designations are equally
  35
      My level of competence in spoken Duna is quite basic. During my time in the Duna-speaking
community I grew to be able to: engage in simple, highly contextualised, conversation; follow more
extended monologues that were presented slowly in a step-by-step and/or repetitive way for my
benefit; communicate more detailed stories and explanations (depending on the forbearance of my
interlocutors); and follow overheard comments, requests and responses where my comprehension
was significantly assisted by the interactional setting and/or prior knowledge.
   36
      In most cases the context and provenance of these sentences is not indicated. In many cases
content suggests that an example is reproduced from (or at least inspired by) natural conversational
language. In other cases the sentence appears to have been extracted from a sermon or biblical story,
or simply to have been constructed to illustrate or test a point of grammar.

"9.2.3     Visual evidential markers
9.2.3.1    Introduction
Duna visual (VIS) category evidentials mark events and situations that were directly
observed by the perceiver. Prototypically, this observation is visual in nature, and
the markers are used in describing things that the perceiver saw happening. Clauses
that include visual evidentials are identified by at least some Duna speakers as spe-
cifically entailing an act of visuo-perception, as illustrated by the fact that they are
commonly translated into Tok Pisin and English as complements of ‘see’.11 The
VIS markers index previous perception of the evidence, but contrast with respect to
aspectual features: perfective v. stative. (See also Table 10.3 concerning aspectual
distinctions and visual evidential markers.)
    Visual category markers can also be used in some contexts where the direct
observation involves something other than visuo-perception. For example when
somebody describes having witnessed a sonic event (such as a door creaking, see
(755)) they may use a VIS marker, even though hearing is (presumably) rather more
important than seeing in this situation. This highlights the fact that in relation to
the Duna evidential markers the label ‘visual’ (VIS) is not a completely transparent
semantic term. It is semantically motivated, but it does not capture all of the contexts
  11
     Cf. De Haan (MSa:10): “[S]peakers who are bilingual in a language that has evidentials and
in one which lacks evidentiality tend to use evidential constructions in the language that otherwise
lacks evidentials.” See Aikhenvald (2004:296-9) concerning the development of evidential strategies
in contact languages as spoken by speakers of languages with grammaticised evidentiality.
314                               Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
in which markers of the relevant category are applicable; we cannot necessarily
intuit from our understanding of ‘seeing’ whether or not the Duna visual evidentials
are appropriate to a given situation.
    This issue is further relevant to cross-linguistic comparison of evidential cat-
egories. Evidential systems quite often include a marker (or markers) that has
visuo-perception as a particularly salient aspect of its meaning and contexts of use
(see Willett (1988), Aikhenvald (2004), De Haan (MSb)). Comparison of vision-
related evidential markers in different languages shows that there is not a univer-
sally equivalent ‘visual’ evidential category (König and Siemund 2007:290). The
Duna vision-related category more nearly resembles the vision-related category of
languages of the same area such as Oksapmin (Lawrence 1987; Loughnane forth-
coming) and Foe (Rule 1977), and Tibeto-Burman languages (for example, Qiang,
LaPolla (2003)) rather than the vision-related category in languages such as Tari-
ana (Aikhenvald 2003) or Tuyuca (Barnes 1984). This is because in Duna visual
category evidential markers strongly imply that the informant is not an active par-
ticipant in the event that is described, and as such are generally incompatible with
informant subjects (§11.2.2); one is either a ‘see-er’ or a ‘do-er’. In contrast, in lan-
guages such as Tariana vision-related evidentials are typically used with informant
subjects, and there is no conflict between ‘seeing’ and ‘doing’.129.2.3.2    Visual (perfective previous)
The regular morpheme -tia (PFV. VIS . P) marks events that were observed occurring
before the time of utterance. The fact that the perception is ‘previous’ and the
aspectual specification perfective means that the event is understood to be some-
thing that happened in the past and is now completed. This morpheme is generally
more appropriate to telic than atelic activities. Some examples are shown in (745) -
(747).13(745)     khunu-ka ndune ndu phulu-ku-tia.

          ‘I was sitting at Hirandareke, and Paul arrived {I saw}.’ (TLIV/KK:230205)
  12
      In the case of some languages (e.g., Eastern Pomo) it can be argued that the evidential marker
which is most appropriate to visually witnessed events does not specifically encode visual semantics
at all (McLendon 2003). Rather, the system includes a participatory/factual evidential (§9.2.9),
which typically implies visuo-perception for certain kinds of events, for example, those with third
person subjects.
   13
      In this and the following chapters approximations of the perception events that are entailed by
evidential markers are shown in curly brackets in the English translation. These ‘evidential transla-
tions’ are impressionistic and derived from contextual features as well as grammatical content.

        (T/JS:KG05V5.40)   Consonantal verbs have a special PFV.VIS . P form, which comprises the base
consonant (§8.1.2) followed by the sequence utia. Some examples of consonantal
verbs marked as perfective visual previous are shown in (748) - (750).(748)   nane no kheni kete-na          sutia.

‘sit’ as in (751), the i-base of wa-class verbs as in (752), and in my experience the
a-base of partial wa-class verbs as in (753), although Giles (MSa) notes that it may
also occur on the i-base of these verbs.(751)   mana ho-me-ya            ho-me-ya         rao-tia-na.

        ‘My father didn’t come either {I saw}.’ (T/SN:101203i)   The perfective visual morpheme may also mark ‘sonic events’ that the speaker
witnessed firsthand. This includes predications whose most salient feature is sound,
such as verbs that describe noisemaking activities (for example, verbs of utterance)
316                               Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers

dium to long-range message communication, when the speaker and addressee are
far apart and may not be able to see each other clearly.(755)    piriri-ngi no hatia ruka-ya-roko,            hatia-na rẽ-ya          angu

         ‘Sandy was standing below and she called me {I observed}.’ (ED/VIII:127)    Examples such as (755) and (756) suggest that it is not truly representative to
identify ‘seeing’ as a primary meaning of the Duna ‘visual evidentials’. In the case
of a verb that describes a primarily sonic event, the visual marker seems to show
that the informant directly witnessed the verb-denoted activity to the highest degree,
given the nature of that activity, rather then identifying it as something that was seen
happening.14 This provides an alternative understanding of the visual (VIS) versus
non-visual sensory (SNS) evidential opposition, namely that they encode relative
degrees of ‘direct witnessing’ (VIS=‘strong’, SNS=‘weak’) which are typically con-
strued as a difference in perceptual mode.
    Further data are needed to investigate whether ‘degree of directness’ repres-
ents a uniformly significant motivating factor in selection between visual previous
(VIS . P) and sensory previous (SNS . P) morphemes. In my data there are few natur-
ally occurring examples of predicates that describe the same kind of sonic event but
are differentially marked with respect to evidential category, and there is no clear
consensus on what this kind of difference encodes. I adopt the view that there are
some competing contexts of use in regard to the distribution of the VIS . P and SNS . P
markers, namely where an event is both sonic in essense and directly witnessed; but
that defining the categories primarily in terms of perceptual mode still provides the
best organising principle for this description.
    The perfective visual marker is generally incompatible with verbs in declarat-
ives that have a speaker subject, as shown by the unacceptability, in ordinary cir-
cumstances, of (757).
  14
    This supports the theory that visual evidentials are generally towards the ‘strong evidence’ end
of a hierarchy of evidential categories in a given language; see, for example, Oswalt (1986:43),
Aikhenvald (2004:307).

ations in which the speaker wishes to place the addressee in a position of epistemic
responsibility. See §11.2.2 for exemplification and discussion.","[342, 343, 344, 345, 346]"

     There are a few recorded instances of an (older) speaker producing sa- ‘take, get’ with an initial

distinct.

Duna has a closed class of existential verbs that can predicate the existence or loc-
ation of someone or something. An existential verb can perform an ‘existential-
classificatory’ function (Rumsey 2002), as different kinds of entities require differ-
ent verbs of existence (§4.1.2.3). The existential verbs also have lexically specific
meanings (for example describing a posture) and grammatical or aspectual mean-
ings in complex structures. The use of a set of verbs that can have either existential
or non-existential meaning, and function (more or less rigorously) as a covert classi-
fication system, is well attested in other languages of New Guinea (see, for example,
Lang 1975; Foley 1986:88-90; Rumsey 2002; Corris 2005:215-6), and elsewhere.9
Clauses headed by existential verbs in Duna can be ‘expanded’ to express possess-
ive relationships (§7.5.5.1).
     Duna existential verbs are listed in Table 3.6. Typical characteristics of an ex-
istential subject argument for each verb are shown in the table. I refer to the top
three verbs as ‘major’ existential verbs, as they are used to describe the existence
and/or location of a wide range of things, and existential/locative predication is one
of their primary functions.10 The lower section of the table lists ‘minor’ existential
verbs, for which the class of appropriate ‘be-ers’ is very limited. These are only
rarely used with existential/locative function.
     Giles (MSa) discusses the use of the three major existential verbs in some detail,
and I reproduce her description of the three-way classification system here, as I find
it very informative and largely agree with her original analysis. In this passage Giles
refers to the verbs using their stative forms, kei (= ka- ‘be/stand’), rei (= ra- ‘be/sit’),
and iri (= (e)ra ‘be/put’).
   9
      See for example Hellwig’s (2006) in-depth semantic analysis of postural/existential verbs in
Goemai (West Chadic).
   10
      In this thesis I conventionally gloss the major existential verbs as ka- ‘be/stand’, ra- ‘be/sit’,
and era ‘be/put’. I do not feel it is possible at this stage to maintain a meaningful gloss distinction
between different senses and functions that can be consistently applied to all occurrences of the verbs
in the language examples.

includes adult males and also larger creatures such as pigs, cassowaries and dogs
(regardless of their sex). The designation ‘body parts’ includes internal organs as
well as limbs and other body parts. The rei (‘be/sit’) class includes squat or broad
items, female humans, and smaller creatures such as possums, birds, and most in-
sects.12 The iri (‘be/put’) class also includes other crawling creatures such as grubs
and is used for more abstract items such as words, songs and customs.","[105, 106, 107]"
"11.2.4.2     Prohibitive, hortative, and desiderative
The prohibitive, hortative, and desiderative morphemes occur as final inflections in
optative sentences (§11.1.4), exemplified in §8.2.2.4 and §8.2.4. These inflections
also occur in interrogatives that function as requests for permission or queries as to
what it would be best to do. Typically, the speaker asks the addressee whether he
or she supports an activity that the speaker intends to carry out. This is exemplified
in (1126) and (1127a) (with the hortative inflection) and (1128) and (1129) (with
the prohibitive inflection).29 An assent to a hortative imperative request is typic-
ally couched as an imperative (§8.2.4.1) as shown in (1127b). The prohibitive and
hortative only occur in yes-no interrogatives in the current data.(1126)     na       ke-wae=pe.

  29
     Giles suggests that these two constructions maintain the immediate/deferred contrast as for dir-
ective utterances (§8.2.4.6), the hortative being an immediate request for permission and the pro-
hibitive a deferred request (that is, for something that the speaker would like to do later rather than
straight away). This seems a sensible analysis and is not contradicted by the 2003-7 data, but I have
no contrastive examples that clearly confirm it.

use of these inflections, in which the subject is the addressee (in the case of the pro-
hibitive) and typically the speaker + the addressee (in the case of the hortative). The
hortative/interrogative can also be used in suggestions regarding group activities, as
in (1130).(1130) hina piriri koro-wae=pe.

curring in an (question word) interrogative utterance, in which case the subject is
the speaker, as shown in (1131) and (1132). This does not appear to be a common
construction, and all but one of the recorded examples come from a rather special
situation, a mourning song where the singer (Kipu Piero) directly addresses the
deceased, a close female friend (see Gillespie 2007b:Chapter 4).(1131) no pa-ka           nga-no=pe.

bearing some relationship to disjunct distribution, as there is a predictable alterna-
tion between a non-speaker subject (in optative sentences) and a speaker subject (in
450                               Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
interrogative sentences). For the hortative, the situation is muddied; the hortative
typically has an inclusive speaker + addressee subject in optative sentences and a
speaker subject in interrogative sentences, but these are not the only options (see,
for example, (706)). However, the fact that there is ‘something going on’ in rela-
tion to a non-speaker/speaker subject switch in all cases suggests that someone who
supplies (or is asked to supply) deontic attitudinal rather than propositional inform-
ation is included as a kind of informant. As with the evidential markers (§11.2.2)
and the prophetic inflection (§11.2.3), the prohibitive, hortative and desiderative
morphemes, broadly speaking, imply a non-informant subject.

11.3     Epistemic assessment and the final predicate: an overview
In this thesis I have described a range of bound forms that express epistemic as-
sessment meanings, including evidential markers, information status markers, and
epistemic particles. These are used by a speaker in indicating how they and others
are positioned in relation to the propositional content of an utterance as knowledge.
They frame the utterance with respect to such questions as: does it represent know-
ledge that was gained through a particular kind of perceptual experience? Is the
proposition a state or event that other people can independently observe and know?
    In this concluding section I summarise certain formal, semantic, and functional
characteristics of these forms, consider the issue of whether these groups should be
gathered together as members of a superordinate formal-functional category, and
comment on the nature of epistemic assessment as an obligatory or optional com-
ponent of final predicate morphology.
    Bound evidential markers (§9.2) target ‘information source’ as their primary
semantic domain. Evidential markers do not co-occur and can be arranged as a
paradigmatic set that encodes a set of contrasts with respect to three parameters:
the evidence category (one of four possibilities derived from the features ‘seen’
and ‘direct’), personal vs impersonal evidence and current vs previous evidence.
The forms of the morphemes typically show some relationship to each other, for
example, the sequence nua recurs in the impersonal evidential forms for each cat-
egory (and does not occur as a component of other inflectional forms). Evidential
markers can typically function as both primary inflectional and ancillary forms.30
    Information status markers (§9.3) indicate features that relate to the incor-
poration of information into the presumed ‘knowledge store(s)’ of the discourse
participants speaker and addressee. They are typically used by a speaker to advise
an addressee on how they should treat the proposition encoded in the utterance, for
example as something that is familiar to them or as something that is particularly
noteworthy. Information status markers do not represent a category of formally
equivalent morphemes, although they are functionally comparable. They all oc-
cur as primary verbal inflections and some may also function as ancillary markers.
Some information status markers can occur in combination with some evidential
markers.
   Epistemic particles (§10.4) indicate features that are relevant to the semantic
domains of information source and/or information status, for example, that a pro-
position is a reasoned judgment of the speaker, or is something hypothetical that
cannot be directly verified. Epistemic particles do not occur as verbal inflections,
  30
     Note however that, excepting for the sensory category marker, impersonal evidentials are not
attested as ancillary markers.

information status markers.","[477, 478, 479, 480, 481]"
"6.6.2   Personal pronouns and -nga ‘EXCV’
The ‘exclusivity’ (EXCV) marker -nga occurs only on locational demonstratives
(§6.4.4.1) and on (non-CS) personal pronouns.
    With personal pronouns, -nga can indicate reflexive activity (the subject acts
upon itself, see §4.2.3.1) as in (429), and/or emphatic identification in that the sub-
ject acts alone and for themselves, as in (430) and (431). Note that if the participant
is referenced by a noun or proper name, -nga is attached to a coreferent dependent
pronoun (§6.6.3) as in (432). This is so even for nouns denoting items whose anim-
acy would not normally be sufficient to warrant pronominal reference; see (433).

"1.2.3    Language and formal education
Children’s schooling is one domain in which language choice is officially legis-
lated. Current national education policy in Papua New Guinea is that the first year
of formal schooling be conducted primarily in the local indigenous language (or a
language that is already known by the students), with English progressively intro-
duced into the classroom after basic literacy and numeracy skills have been acquired
in the vernacular. After three years attendance at a local elementary school, children
progress to primary school (entering at Grade 3), and from this point English is to
be the main language of instruction.24 Schooling in the Duna region, as in many
areas of Papua New Guinea, demonstrates a large gap between national policy and
local practice.
  22
      I assume that Tok Pisin is the lingua franca Stürzenhofecker refers to here.
  23
      Although several of the people I worked with closely spoke English very well, this was largely
as a consequence of having worked for many years in collaboration with the anthropologist Nicole
Haley, that is, a very specific and unusual circumstance.

ment of Education, Papua New Guinea.
16                                                           Chapter 1. Introduction
    The effective running of the Kopiago Community School is beset with diffi-
culties (for example, staff shortages, absconding staff, a dearth of materials). The
teachers I spoke with appeared to be confused about the curriculum they were sup-
posed to be teaching; the institution of elementary schools comprised a consider-
able re-structuring of the schooling system, and was supposed to be accompanied
by further curriculum reform, but the school had not received any new textbooks or
materials relating to this. The policy of using English as the main language of in-
struction from Grade 3 was as far as I could tell only marginally implemented. One
teacher from the Kopiago Community School that I spoke with (who came from an-
other Highlands province and was not a native Duna speaker) explained that in his
classroom he used some English, some Tok Pisin, and some Duna (having learnt the
language as a consequence of moving to Kopiago). I met no school-age children
during my fieldwork (including children living in the greater Lake Kopiago area,
Aluni Valley, and Yokona) who demonstrated any degree of fluency in English.
    The operation of elementary schools in the Lake Kopiago region is sporadic and
receives little consistent attention from the Provincial Education Department (situ-
ated in Mendi, the provincial capital). Under the current education system, it is in-
tended that local people receive elementary teacher training, including guidance and
practical assistance in the development and productions of vernacular curriculum
materials. The running of an elementary school becomes largely the responsibility
of these individuals in collaboration with their immediate community and perhaps
a church organisation. However, the elementary teacher training is not extensive,
and for someone from the Lake Kopiago area is comparatively costly and involves
travel that may be expensive or dangerous. It is difficult to obtain reliable informa-
tion about when the training courses are scheduled, and problematic to organise any
financial transactions from the Kopiago area (both in terms of paying initial fees
and receiving subsequent wages or school funding) owing to poor communications
and a lack of any local banking service.
    During my time in the Duna region, I saw no evidence that any elementary
schools in the area were receiving consistent government support. The schooling
that is available to younger children is thus largely an ad hoc affair, as it relies on
impetus from the community and/or church as concerns building and furnishing a
school, and the dedication of individuals who have some literacy skills and are will-
ing to spend time and effort trying to disseminate these without the benefit of train-
ing or materials. As the sound representations of the official Duna orthography (i.e.,
that in which the New Testament translation is written) are quite difficult to master
without explicit training and much practice, the self-designated teachers themselves
generally find reading and writing in Duna quite problematic, and do not feel com-
1.2. Duna language                                                                                17
fortable teaching it. Thus in at least some elementary schools Tok Pisin rather than
Duna is employed as a language of literacy acquisition (although most children do
not actually speak Tok Pisin when they start attending school). In some cases the
teacher may also introduce English language exercises, based on any textbooks they
have to hand or their memories of their own schooling.
    Some adult literacy education programmes (focussing on bible study) are also
run in the Lake Kopiago region through church networks. My impression is that
these are primarily conducted in Tok Pisin, but I have not discussed this issue in
detail with trainers or participants.","[44, 45, 46]"
"3.5     Adjectives
I refer to a group of Duna words that have formal features of both nominal and
verbal roots and generally describe properties of things as adjectives. Like nom-
inals and unlike verbs, adjectives can occur as clausal predicates in bare root form
(§4.1.1.2). They may also occur as modifiers in nominal phrases (§5.2.2). Adjectival
roots can be inflected with some morphology that is not available to nominal roots,
for example the habitual inflection -na (see, for example, (50)). Certain adjectives
can occur in a complex predicate construction with the verb ka- ‘be/stand’, describ-
ing the inception or achievement of a change of state (§7.5.4.3).15
    Some examples of Duna adjectives are shown in Table 3.7. I have grouped to-
gether adjectives that have some semantic features in common (for example, dealing
with dimension), but I do not propose that each group represents a distinct category.
The forms in Table 3.7 represent the four ‘core semantic types’ that are typically as-
sociated with the word class adjective (dimension, age, value and colour), as well as
the ‘peripheral semantic types’ of physical property and human propensity (Dixon
2004).
    As can be seen in Table 3.7, many adjectival words finish with a sequence Vo. In
Duna as spoken in the Kopiago area, the final o is subject to deletion in some lexical
items with no clear change in meaning or function.16 It is highly likely that this
final o is a semi-fossilised reflex of the perfective verbal inflection, -o (§8.2.2.1).17
  13
      Note that I designate these forms as members of a particular word class rather than as con-
stituents that are occupying a particular structural/functional position in construction with a verb.
This Duna word class could also be termed that of ‘coverbs’, following the use of this term in the
Australianist literature.
   14
      As a general rule, if the root is not attested occurring with final verb morphology (or has been
judged unacceptable in combination with it), typically occurs in bare root form, and immediately
precedes a consonantal or wa-class verb in all known examples, I interpret it as a verb adjunct, not a
verb.
   15
      The root kete ‘small’ can additionally be used in adverbial expressions (see, for example, (425)).
However this is not a general characteristic of adjectival roots.
   16
      Results of the orthography survey carried out with Duna speakers from the Kelabo area suggest
that deletion of the o is not acceptable for speakers of the south-west Duna variety.
   17

                    ndeo        ‘hard’ (GG)This analysis would suggest that the roots in question originally had a more clearly
inceptive or progressive meaning (e.g., ‘become big’, ‘become yellow’) and that the
perfective inflection was added to indicate complete achievement of the specified
change. This can also be argued for those adjectival roots that end in u, as the
perfective inflection has an allomorph -u.
    Some adjectival roots, such as kete ‘small’, typically occur in nominal phrases
whereas others such as rakare ‘cold’ typically occur as predicates of verbal clauses.
The latter term can be negated with the negative circumfix na- -ya (§8.3), whereas
the former cannot. The behaviour of all adjectival roots with respect to this property
is not known. However, it is likely that further study will provide formal evidence
for the existence of different noun-like and verb-like classes within the proposed
group of adjectival roots, primarily relating to a distinction between properties that
are more time-stable, and those that are more dynamic.","[109, 110]"
"3.2.2.1   Personal names ( PSN)
Personal names are given to high animacy individuals, typically humans but also
supernatural beings, pet animals, and sometimes animals that are characters in nar-
ratives.
    Traditional Duna personal names were and are drawn from a variety of sources,
for example the term for a kind of plant or animal, or words that reflected an event
that occurred around the time of a person’s birth; see Stürzenhofecker (1998:48).
Kenny Kendoli commented to me that a highly appropriate name for a male child
was that of his father’s father’s father. Most Duna people born after the derestric-
tion of the area (§1.1.3) have a ‘Christian’ or baptismal name as well as or instead
of a traditional name (whether or not they were actually baptised). These names
are usually related to recognised biblical or secular names of the English-speaking
world.
    A personal name may consist of several phonological words. In a two-word
name of a present-day person, the first may be traditional or non-traditional, and the
second the name of the person’s father (or, in the case of a woman, sometimes her
husband’s first name). These patronymic and andronymic naming practices were
introduced by the colonial regime throughout Papua and New Guinea. In a three-
word name, the first name is typically non-traditional, the second traditional, and
the third again the father’s or husband’s. For example, one of the Duna people I
worked with closely gives his full name as Kenny Yuwi Kendoli. His traditional
name ‘Yuwi’ was given to him at birth, and the name ‘Kenny’ acquired later in life
(see Haley 2002:122). ‘Kendoli’ is his father’s name. People address Kenny as
either Kenny or Yuwi, and might use either ‘Kenny Yuwi’ or ‘Kenny Kendoli’ to
clarify reference when talking about him. Kenny’s wife Kipu has a traditional first
name and takes her father’s name, Piero, as her last name.
   Nicknames (for example, expressions that relate to a person’s physical appear-
ance, shortenings of Christian names) are widely used.4 For example, Kenny’s
     4
    These may provide a roundabout way of reinterpreting a Christian name as a Duna name through
loan-blending. For example, in one case a chubby baby boy was named ‘William’. His family
quickly shifted to calling him Wimo, which is segmentable as a Duna phrase composed of wi ‘game
animal’ and mo ‘like’. See also Gillespie (2007b:107-8) for discussion of the history and meaning
of one young woman’s nickname.
3.2. Nominals                                                                                   73
eldest son is officially named ‘Rodney Kenny’ (for example, this is what appears
on his government issue health card). Members of his family might call him by the
name Rodney or by the name ‘Yaku’ which means ‘white-haired’ and refers to the
fact that he was very blond as a little boy.5
    It is quite common for same-sex siblings to be given names that contain matched
strings of sounds, for example Joselin and Josepin for two sisters. This kind of
name-matching is found in the names of spirit women, ancestral beings, and pikono
characters, for example the supernatural sisters Papumi and Lupumi who appear in a
narrative about the placement of gold in the Ok Tedi mining region. See also Haley
(2002:123) regarding the naming of twins with parallel terms.","[101, 102]"
"‘Side’ marker -yaki    The bound form -yaki attaches to a lexical root in expressions
that denote a ‘side’, in the sense of a contrastively defined space or direction.10 In
talking about this form, Duna speakers I worked with treated it as something that
had independent denotative sense—that is, they would unpick it from a construction
of which it was part as a separate term that meant ‘side’—but it does not occur as a

Compounding is defined by Anderson (1985:40) as “word formation based on the
combination of two or more members of (potentially) open lexical classes”. In
this section I describe Duna compounds that are composed of two common noun
elements that form a new common noun. This kind of word formation does not
appear to be widely productive in Duna and is mostly limited to the semantic domain
of kin and peer terms.
     Kin and peer compounds are formed from two nouns that describe types of
people, generally those that are of an equivalent generation and opposite gender (for
example, mother-father). These correspond to Anderson’s typology of ‘parallel’
coordinate compounds (1985:50).
     Some common compounds of this type are shown in Table 5.1. The meaning
of the resultant term does not transparently describe the combination of two indi-
viduals. For example the term ima-anoa ‘woman-man’ is used to mean ‘person,
people’, not ‘a man and a woman’. Similarly kheni-khane ‘male’s brother-cross-sex
sibling’ can be used as a generic term ‘sibling’ referring to the siblings of both men
and women (see, for example, (225) in §5.3.3.3), despite the fact that kheni as an
individual term only refers to male siblings of males.
     Compound terms show elision at the boundary of two vowels (see for example
ima-anoa ‘people’), and this together with intonation suggests they are a single
word. In some compounds there is a significant phonemic difference between the
independent words and their compound form, for example the loss of the final syl-
lable of imane ‘girl’ in imanane, an example of haplology. In some compounds the
nouns are less tightly bound; for example the ordering of the elements ingini ‘son’
and wane ‘daughter’ in ‘offspring’ is not fixed, as both inginiwane and wanengini
occur in the textual data with no discernable difference in meaning.11 This flexibil-
ity is more characteristic of productive collocation of separate nouns (§5.4.1) rather
than word formation. This is in contrast to imanane ‘children’, which is a fixed
term, and cannot be substituted with naneimane (or similar).
     A few other lexicalised ‘natural kind’ collocations are also attested in the data,
comprising two nouns that function as a unit without being pair-marked (§5.4.1).
  11
       Of 36 instances of the two terms in texts, inginiwane occurred 26 times and wanengini 10 times.

(1060), and interrogatives with speaker subjects, as in (1061). The latter situation
in particular is functionally/pragmatically marked, and may highlight the fact of
the evidence itself rather than of the predicate activity. Timon Kangapu suggested
to me that a question such as that shown in (1061) would be suitable for a court
dispute situation, in which the speaker refutes a claim by the addressee concerning
their (the speaker’s) activities. The interrogative is rhetorical as the speaker already
knows whether they went or not; this utterance questions the addressee’s evidence,
covertly asserting that the activity did not happen.(1059)     anoa hinanda-ta ru-yarua.

         (CD/XIV:76)    Evidential marking typically does not occur in declaratives with a volitional
speaker subject, or interrogatives with a volitional addressee subject. Such marking
is generally judged odd or ungrammatical. I found that this judgment was partic-
ularly strong concerning visual and sensory category evidential markers; KK, RA,
PK and KP all categorically rejected constructed declaratives such as (1062) and
(1063) (speaker subject + visual or sensory evidential) and interrogatives such as
(1064) and (1065) (addressee subject + visual or sensory evidential) as unsayable.(1062) * no hutia

evidential markers in some constructed sentences. These were not judged to be
ungrammatical, as a sensible interpretation of a third person subject argument was
readily plausible in each case. In (1066) and (1067), the pronouns that correspond
to the informant were assumed to be object NPs, and subject NPs were assumed to
be elided (§4.2.3.3). In (1068) the second person pronoun ko was assumed to refer
to a possessor, and the subject NP elided.(1066)    no ke-ya     hutia.

         ‘[They] steambaked your pig {you infer}?’ (CD/VIII:3)    The examples shown in this section illustrate that evidential markers exhibit a
disjunct distributional pattern in that they are typically inappropriate for (volitional)
informant subjects but are generally appropriate in other contexts.19 Activities in
which one is a volitional and controlling participant (an agentive subject) are more
normally presented as ‘directly’ experienced, not mediated by perceptual evidence.
    As we have already seen in several examples in the preceding chapters, within
narrative texts, it is often the perceptual world of a main protagonist in the story
that is important to the choice of evidential marker, rather than the viewpoint of
the actual speaker (the storyteller). The typical collocation of informant and per-
ceiver is not maintained, because the storyteller commonly steps back and forth
between his or her own viewpoint (for example, using the previous notional evid-
ential in its ‘hearsay’ marking function) and information sources that are present
in the story-world as in (1069). In such cases, the usual implications that relate to
subject identity (and volition, see following) are transferred to the individual (or
group of individuals) that is the empathic deictic centre at this point in the narrative.
That is, evidential markers that evoke a protagonist’s information source will occur
in situations where this protagonist is not a volitional subject.(1069)     ra-ta       ka-ta,          khene kaki-ra-ra              khulau-yatia.

One context in which evidential markers do occur with informant subjects is when
the described activity is non-volitional. This is a common pattern in languages with
evidential morphology (cf. Curnow 2003), and is quite typical of disjunct forms in
languages with conjunct/disjunct systems.20 Examples (1070) - (1072) are headed
  19
      It would be somewhat misleading to say that evidential markers are highly suitable to all non-
informant subjects, as interrogatives that combine a volitional speaker subject with an evidential
marker are also atypical (see (1061)). However, this ‘oddness’ stems in the main from an unusual
arrangement of subject identity and speech act type (i.e., people do not typically ask questions about
their own volitional activities), rather than solely from incongruity of subject identity and predicate
morphology.
   20
      However it may not be a necessary attribute of such systems; see Curnow (2002) concerning
Awa Pit.

  21
     I would not say that it is entirely typical to mark involuntary experience clauses for sensory
evidence in this way; in the textual data (which includes many descriptions of speakers’ illnesses,
fears, emotional responses, etc.) it appears just as usual for people to use non-evidential inflections
in recounting these kinds of personal experiences. However, sentences such as (1070) - (1072) are
always accepted as perfectly sensible and sayable, in contrast to the ungrammatical volitional subject
examples shown in (1063) and (1065).

"3.2.1   Common nouns
Common nouns typically occur in nominal phrases, where they may be modified by
postposed adjectives, quantifiers, and/or demonstratives (§5.2). A nominal phrase
that includes a common noun may be referential and denote a particular individual
(or group of individuals, etc.), or non-referential, denoting a generic class of items.
Some examples of common nouns are shown in Table 3.1. These are simple root
forms. Common nouns can also be morphologically complex (§5.2.1.1 - 5.2.1.3).
    Common nouns such as hatia, ‘accessway’, denote a fairly general semantic
field. When used alone, hatia typically means ‘path, road’, but it can alternatively be
preceded by a nominal (in possessor position, see §5.2.6) to form a phrase with more
specific meaning, for example: anda hatia (house accessway) ‘door, doorway’;
ambu hatia (lips accessway) ‘mouth opening’; or khia hatia (faeces accessway)
‘anus’.
    Words for describing plants and animals include generic terms such as heka
‘bird’ or rowa ‘tree’, and terms that describe particular varieties of generic types,
such as wawa ‘egret’ and yawale ‘casuarina’. Words that denote individual kinds of
flora and fauna are likely to occur in complex nouns as nominal specifiers following
generic terms (§5.2.1.5).

                         mana            ‘custom, manner of behaviour’    The common noun nane ‘boy, young man’ is a human-descriptive noun that
makes reference to gender and age. Other human-descriptive nouns are kin terms
such as hakini ‘female’s sister’, ame ‘father, male ancestor’.1 Human-descriptive
nouns are productively combined as compound nouns (§5.2.1.3). They are com-
monly used as terms of address (see, for example, (113)), and some (most notably
antia ‘mother’2 and nane ‘boy, young man’) are used as interjections and exclama-
tions to express overwhelming emotion (for example amazement or grief), particu-
larly in storytelling and song (see also Gillespie 2007b:107).
    Some common nouns can occur in construction with a verb in complex predic-
ation structures (§7.5). For example, the common noun mboko shown in Table 3.1
is one of a small group of what I term ‘ailment nominals’. These occur in complex
predicates that describe indispositions and are exemplified in §7.6.1.2.","[99, 100]"

kone (which is generally quite unrestricted in terms of what it can modify), but are
not usually marked with other bound forms, and do not occur as constituents in
independent structural units (for example, nominal phrases). In this typical use I
refer to them as adverbs. However, there are also some examples in my data in
which time-of-day terms are inflected with (non-final) verbal morphology, in which
case I understand them to be functioning as a kind of verbal predicate. Time of
day-terms are also used as greetings, in which case a drawn out vowel o is typically
added to the end of the expression.",[119]
"1.2.4    Previous description of the language
Previous descriptions of the Duna language that have been available to me comprise
three unpublished works, one by Dennis and Nancy Cochrane, and two by Glenda
Giles.
    The missionary team Dennis and Nancy Cochrane produced a 26-page manu-
script, ‘Duna essentials for translation’ for submission to the Grammar Department
of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) in 1966. Voorhoeve (1975) cites this
document (plus two wordlists) as his source.
    Glenda Giles produced an (undated) 11-page ‘Guide to the Pronuciation of
Duna’, as well as a set of 41 ‘Duna language lessons’ comprising approximately
109 pages25 and a 5-page index (cross-referenced to the numbered lessons) of bound
morphemes and irregular verb forms. These were probably produced in the 1970s,
and stemmed from Giles’ intensive work on the language in the course of bible
translation and other mission work with Duna people.26 Lessons are typically struc-
tured around the introduction of bound verbal morphology and/or irregular verb
inflections, with examples of every newly introduced form, and practice exercises
that require knowledge of material presented in earlier and later lessons. She also
provides several summaries of covered material. The description in her lessons is
occasionally repetitive and/or contradictory, as it is clear that she was developing
her analysis as she wrote, and did not regard the document that I have a copy of as
representing a final version.27
  25
      In the copy I have of the document a few pages are clearly missing but I do not know exactly
how many.
   26
      It seems likely that Giles had access to the Cochranes’ report before she started her work, and
that she and the Cochranes worked together to some extent. Giles’ major Duna project was the
translation of the New Testament, and this was presumably something the Cochranes were initially
working towards; mission gossip has it that the Cochranes were extremely disheartened by Giles’
quick aptitude in the language and vigorous efficiency, and so gave up working on Duna themselves.
   27
      For example, in Lesson 37 Giles introduces a “general summary of the final verb” with the
following words: “The material presented here is in summary form and is not entirely consistent
with what has gone before but I think presents a more correct analysis. [...] I hope to re-order these

    Giles typically worked with Duna speakers at Kelabo in the south-east region
(see §1.2.1), or with Duna students who were attending Koroba High School (again
predominantly drawn from the south-east region). I initially approached her work
with strong doubts about its relevance to a study of Duna as spoken in Lake Kopi-
ago, as a number of people had made comments that her materials represented a
very different variety of the language.28 However, the differences I have found
between Giles’ manuscript data and the 2003-7 data collected from Duna speakers
of the north-west region are quite small,29 and less than I originally anticipated.
    Giles’ manuscripts have been extremely useful to me in my study, particularly in
the middle stages of my work.30 Her materials have in many cases provided me with
ideas and/or confirmation concerning analyses of many forms and structures in the
2003-7 data, as well as additional language data through the example sentences that
she provides throughout her materials (see also §1.3.3). Although our approaches
are quite different (for example, her purpose is primarily pedagogical whereas mine
is descriptive) and our structural analyses of the Duna language diverge in many
respects, my description owes a good deal to Giles’ earlier work. I have noted
very few bound forms that Giles does not provide some mention of in her work,
and very few instances of a significantly divergent semantic interpretation of these
forms from the ones I present in this thesis. In several cases I have adopted the
labels that Giles proposed for particular verbal inflections and verb classes, and this
is indicated when the terms are first introduced. Throughout this thesis I further
reference other sections of Giles’ work which I found especially comprehensive,
and/or which I judge contributed significantly to the development of my analysis.
    As intimated throughout this chapter, the Duna world has been investigated and
described by researchers in the fields of anthropology and ethnomusicology. Sev-
eral of these researchers include extensive documentation and discussion of Duna
vocabulary, as well as including Duna text in their works. I also draw upon these
sources to some extent in my analysis of the language and these are cited as relevant  28
      Duna speakers (from Lake Kopiago) with whom I was able to work before going to the field
suggested that Giles’ work was a description of Duna as spoken in the south-east, and was not
highly applicable to north-west Duna. Academic researchers working in Lake Kopiago, Horale, and
the Aluni Valley also all reported that Giles’ description was unhelpful to them in terms of language
learning in the field (which is not to say that they did not learn Duna), and the main reason given for
this was dialect difference.
   29
      For example, there are a few cases where a bound morpheme described by Giles was unattested
in the 2003-7 textual data. The Duna speakers I worked with found these forms readily interpretable,
but typically identified them (in full knowledge that I had noted them in Giles’ work) as being
specific to south-east Duna or being of Huli origin. Some lexical differences were also noticeable
(§1.2.1).
   30
      This statement has a kind of backwards logic, but is nevertheless true; it was often only after I
had independently arrived at a tenable analysis of something that aspects of Giles’ description would
suddenly make perfect sense. See §9.2.6.3.
