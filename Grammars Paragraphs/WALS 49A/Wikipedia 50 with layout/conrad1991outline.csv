   Bukiyip (Mountain Ampesh) is a member of the Atapesh familly of the Kombio stock-of the
Torricelil phylum in Papua New Guinea, as documented by D.C, Laycock (1973:14-15). It ix
spoken by approximately 5,000 people living on the southem side of the Prince Alexunder Ran
between Yangoru and Maprik in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea, The peas
recognise at least four minor dialect variations: Charnaun, Buki, Lohuhwim and Yamil, ‘The same
language, with considerable dialect variation, is         en in a wide region extending north and
      west bap     the Torricelli Range to the coast   between Dagua   and Suom, as reported by Bab
Bugenhagen (1981), The other two distinct languages ofthe Araees family listed by Laycock
(1973) are Muhian (Southem Arapesh) and Bumbjita, which are 5     fin the area west
                                                                                  of      Mapri
ee the Amuk River and Drekikir. Nekitel (1985) has            Abn’ ass fourth member of the
family.
   The distinctive feature of the langeages of the Arapesh family is their extensive noun class
system, which plays a central roje in their grammatical structure. In the verb morphology, every
subject and object alfix agrees with its nomindl referent. In addition there is obligatory noun
phrase agreement between every modifier and the head noun, Beyond this, every pronoun and
demonstrative also agrees with the noun to which it refers.
   The only previously published study of Bukiyip is the work of RP. Fortune (1942); which is
based on the coastal dialect spoken around Dagua, This present study? follows Dy Fortune's basic
analysis of the noun class system, with minor adaptations, ag well as benefiting from certain
insights presented in his grammatical notes. The grammatical structure of the coastal diatect is
quite similar to Bukiyip. “A comparison using the SIL 200-word list shows 86 per cent probuble
cognates in noun and verb stems.
   The data consists of 85 texts collected during 30 months residence a} Bubuame village between
1971 and 1976 under the car raha the Summer Institute of Linguistics, These texts represent
Lohuhwim, Chamaun and Buki dialect groups, but are primarily from the later two.
   The approach of this study is somewhat eclectic. It usually follows the tagmemic model, but
be      rom it in the use of transformational rales to describe certain stem-level and clause-level
relationships,
   The sentence level analysis in section 7 follows the approach of Ballard, Conrad and Longacre
(1971), That study is committed to the thesis that “a set of deep grammar relations necds to be
posited to account for the moving of the same or very sitnilar lexical material through changing
pattems of interclausal relations, The sentence, as the immediately ascending hierarchical level
oc
disjunction, > for ‘if-then"" and P for ‘negation of predicate P’, have a precision in mathematical
logic which does nor allow them to correspond precisely with natural language structures,
However, the correspondence is sufficiently close hy           their use here, The symbolism used
to represent deep Structure relations in section 7 is used with   the realisation thas it must be treated
with caution and not ken to imply perfect correspondence with its use in mathematical logic,
   Because of the elaborate noun phrase agreement system in Bukiyip, this study begins with
word level and works up through stem, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph and discourse,
     Some features of the verb morphology are rather unusual for 4 non-Austronesian language,
With very few exceptions, every verb is affixed for person and number. Therefore the verb
morphology is essentially the same, regardless of the verb's distribution, Outside the Arapesh
family, no other language in the Torricelli phylum {s Known to have this extreme scarcity of
unaffixed verbs,                                                                             =
~The     two major exceptions to universal verb affixation for person. and number are some
imperitive forms in which all affixition is fost in certain cases, and cerjain infrequent constructions
consisting of repeated idemical unaffixed verb stems used to signal intense or continued action,
Discounting these exceptions, there are no ‘medial verbs"" which have « more limited affixation
pattem. This means that the verb        hology is not useful in determining sentence boundaries.
Intonation is not very wseful cither,      refore 4 set of multiple tazmemic and lexicosemantic
cfiteria have been used to define the sentence, These criteria include repeated verb or repeated
close pias Resa of the verb, quote closers, question closers, scope of negation, occurrence of
Time,        tion, and or Benefactive-Instrumenial fagmemes, and the occurrence of certain
senlence-level tagmemes at certain characteristic places in clause. strings. The application of this
diverse set of criteria gives. a consistent and plousible analysis, Furthermore, these units
correspond closely with the conclusions-of a strictly      lexicosemantic approach 10 unother non-
Austronesian language of the Sepik-Ramu phylum (Abbot 1979).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"

RULE 23: Semivowel insertion
  In this mule, the following two definitions are used:
V- is defined as u, o (rounded vowels)
Vy is defined as & 6a, 4, ¢, ae (unrounded vowels)
        Vib+ Vo             +    Vw
        Vut + Ve            >=     Vow,

This rule generally does not apply in fast speech.

   In the   previous three examples (115) to (117), there seems to be no difference in meaning
between the owo forms other than the fact that the object has more prominence when it occurs as
the free form. However, in (118) to (£20) there is a slight semantic or pragmatic difference which
is. specific to the particular verb involved. In (118), for example, the form with the free object is
used in the case where there is some doubt whether the speaker knows the woman involved,
vies the second form is used there is no doubt: the speaker knows both the husband and bis
   ic.

    In (119), the form with the free object is obligatory               if the object referent is visible. However, if
the object referentis inanimate this distinction is much                Jess clear cut.

     In (120), there is a slight semantic contrast present. The free object form is used in situations
where the object is new information, such as when someone does not sce the pig. The bound
pronoun form is used if the object is given information, in such contexts as people looking for a
pig and then finding it.

       In some cases, presumably to avoid ambiguity, the rule does not apply. For instance, in (122),
if the rule were to apply, reducing -ch to h, the form would be ta-h-2h, which would be
ambiguous. It could mean cither “The dog ate fingers’or ""The dog atea finger’,

    Verbs are divided into eight classes.on the basis of affixation with members. of the classes
<n-> ‘subject marker’ and/or <-und> ‘object marker’ and occurrence with free subjects and/or free
objects, as indicated in Table 7.
   In every case the members of classes <n-> and <-und> show obligatory agreement in number
and gender with the nouns to which they refer. The summary, Tabic 4, indicated some of the
         features of these eight verb-classes, which are shown
                                                           in Table 7. Each class will now be
  escribed in detail, since the differences in affixation and co-occurrence restrictions are
considerable. The verb nucleus for each verb class will be filled by the verb root corresponding to
that verb class, There may be other verb stems which are fers as well,
       Class 1 is a relatively small class:of wansitive yerbs in which the subject prefix from the class
<n->is followed by amood marker and then by an obligatory object prefix from the class <-und>
Which is followed by the verb root:

   These semantic classes of verbs based on case frames can be grouped into nine different classes
which can be ordered according to the degree of transitivity, somewhat similar to the approach
used by Bruce for Alamblak (Brice 1979;345-353),                   In this analysis the ordeting was determined
by the number of participunts and by the applicabrlity of the imperative and reciprocal-reflexive
transformations. Those verb classes which could not undergo these transformations were
considered to have lower brnggl Hs diese was verbAlin to be ich there big ol irae cipro
be              without difficulty,              er signifies      the                degree of transitivity,   beginning   with   the
vant manchilee and going on to the highest (case frame Hie do 9). ‘This order is Hustrated in Table
9, which shows the acceptability of these two transformations for cach verb class.

of transitivity as determined by such factors as number of         participants and occurrence with an
object. If netther transformation is acceptable, as in verbs of classes | and 2, this correlates with
verbs such as éma- ‘heavy’ and -gak ‘die’, which do not take an object and have only one
participant. If only one of the pt dha              fox      degen with verb classes 3 and 4, this
correlates wtih verbs such as -wich ‘enter’ and éigei- “to be afraid’,                              If both transformations are
acceptabic, as in verb classes 5 through 9, this correlates with verbs which either have more
panicipants or which take an ores or both, such as -/eh ‘ery’, -nak “go”, -tik ‘look at, find’,
~klupu ‘wash’, -bitk ‘put’ and -ki ‘give’, There is one intermediate class, class 5, which ig in the
middle position among the nine classes. In class 5.verbs, both transformations are acceptable, but
not unconditionally so, The reciprocal/reflexive transformation is generally acceptable only if there
is an additional free advetb present, as illustrated in (167) through (170), The examples

3.6 NUMERAL
   Numerals are a class of bound stems occurring with the noun suffixes in Noun Class Matrix 1,
Numemis occur in the Head Slot of Numentl Phrases (5.15) and in the Modifier slovof Modified
Noun Phrase, (5.2:1).
   The assumed basic forms of the numeral roots are:
       wu-     = *one’
       bia-      “two""
The particular morphophonemic rule governing the uffixation of these forms is that the final vowel
of the numeral assimilates to the point of articulation of the final vowel of the noun stem
                                                                                            it
modifies. Other                        honemic rules also apply following this assimilation, such as rule 11,
iustrated in (192) through              {195).

                one                   cl9    orb                  one
   In (195) the si does not change because the final vowel of Jabip ‘rib* is also a central yowe!
thus the conditions for morphophonemic rule 1] are not met: therefore ain atdp does not            and
                                                                                               change

(201) nobati    + -m = (élmam) ~            =nobatin
      four        cy. omen                  four

      four        cILIPL houses              four
There is also a similarly suffixed quantitative stem éné- which can mean ‘one, an, some’,
depending partly on the noun which it modifies and pany on whether the suffix to show
concordance with the noun is marked for singular or plural. This stem occurs in the Modifier, stot
of Modified Noun Phrase; (5.2.1) and is importunt in the introduction of new information. That
is, when a new participant ts introduced in o naruive, itis obligatory that it be introduced with this
form.

"6.2.5 NEGATION TRANSFORMATION
   Negative Clauses are formed fram the indicative clauses by application of the Negation or
future Negation transformations as illustrated in Table 11, Conse Matrix 1, feciion 6.1, and
defined by the following rules:
Past Negation Transformation:
 1, Inteansitive/transitive Clause + wo/wotak + Clause + ¢,
2.. Topic Comment Clause: + Topic + Comment+ + Topic wo. + Comment e,
3.. Stative Clause: + Temporal + Subject + Predicate: adjective + + ‘Temporal + Subject + wo +
Predicate: adjective e&
4. Equational Clause:     Temporal + Subject + Predicate: adjective + Temporal + Subject + wo +
Predicate; adjective e,                             ~
Future Negation Transformation (Fur Neg):
5. Intransitive/transitive Clause > kobwi + Intransitive/ransitive Clause.
6. Topic Comment Clause: + Topic + Comment + Topic + kobwi + Comment.
Conditions of application:

   A relative clause is formed from an indicative clause or from an indicative Topic Comment
Clause by the following relative clause transformation:
       indicative Clause -+ indicative Clause + dit = nominalised clause
       Topic Comment Clause + Topic Comment Clause + <-uni> + -iii = nominalised clause
  ‘That is, the transformation adjoins to an indicative Clavse the relativiser afi ‘the one{s) who,
that which’, cic. The wansformation can also apply to a Topic Comment clause by adjoining a
member of the <-unti> class, followed by -afi.   ¢ that the resulting relativised clause is called-a
nominalised clause, That is because here sezms to be no difference bewween nominalisation and
relativisation.
   Relative clauses are very frequent in text. They occur primarily manifesting the Modifier 2
tagineme in Modified Noun Phrases, the Subject tagmerme of indicative transitive clavses, and the
Tople tagmeme of Topic Comment Clauses,
Rules for relativisation trunsformation:
 1. Usually the final vowel of the <-umi> class sufitxis replaced by a.
2. Comment tagmeme of the Topic: Comment Clause must be manifested by wak ‘no’ and the
Topic tagmeme can be deleted (jee (823) below),
3, Most frequently the Topic Comment Clause occurs manifesting the Condition tugmeme of i
Conditional   Sentence,

         ted verb or repeated close synoiym of yerb is.a particularly useful and objective critetion,
but difficult to apply.   It is necessary to note carefully whether or not (1) the repeated stretch is
identical with ors    than the first occurrence, or (2) the repeated stretch is longer than the first
occurrence — particularly whether an additional clause level tagmeme or verb phrase level
tagmemie is present. In case (1) the repeated verb marks a sentence boundary while in case (2) the
repetitions are joined to form an Amplification Sentence which ends at the end of the repeated
Stretch,
    Enis of quotations are ovcasionally marked by QF 2 (see Direct Quote Sentence) but more often
simply by the context and meaning and the reference af the pronouns or person-subject affixes on
the verbs,
   Ends of questions are marked by context and occasionally by characteristic question words
and/or intenation,
   Usually the Time clause-level tagmeme occurs at the beginning of a clause or string of clauses
which turns out to be a sentence, while the Locative or Benefactive ctause-level tagmemes usually
occur at the end of such a string,
   Vocative tagmemes, manifested by pronouns, personal names, and cenain kinship terms, all
with u charicteristic calling intonation, typically occur at the beginning of a string which T would
hope and expect to be a sentence. Afterthought tagmeme, manifested by a Coordinate Noun
Phrase or an Apposition Noun Phrase, typically occurs-at the end of                2 string. There are
several conjunctions which typically occur preceding one of these strings: these items include na
‘and’ (which is a loan from      Tok Pisin), dowk   ‘now, and’, olf or orait ‘and, but, all right, like
this, and now"".   Therefore such items, provided they occur following an immedintely preceding
final intonation, are often good indications of a sentence boundary. Such conjunctions typically
precede the Vocative tagmeme if it occurs and would generally be the first clement of any such
= which might be called sentence, Sec the bidimensional array for Simple Sentence in section
TAB.and their real function can be seen only by studying the various examples given throughout section
7, with the qualification thar the full function can be understood only by looking at the entire
discourse context.
   Except for the intonational eriteria, many of the above criteria for sentence may seom rather
arbitrary, The claim that they work together as a system is supported by a Separate analysis: of
Bukiyip sentence using the criterion of local cohesion (Conrad 1983). ‘This stud provides

carefully with native speakers and in the particular contexts in which they occur they do have the
meaning indicated.
   The following approach has been used in the. presentation of each sentence type: Pollowing an
introductory section discussing the function and distribution of the sentence type is @ bidimensional
array Indicating the structure. If an asterisk occurs at the bottom of any column in which fillers of
a particular shot arc fisted, this means that it is posable that the present list of fillers is exhaustive,
If there is no. such asterisk, then it is probable thal a number of other types of fillers also can occur.
                                                                          pny
Examples-are grouped according to the deep structure they encode. If a sentence type encodes
more than one deep structure, the order of presentation corresponds with the order in which the
deep structures are listed in the lower half of the bidimensional array. The percentages which
occur above or near the + (optional) symbol in the first line of the array indicate the approximate
percentage of the examples in which the optional tagmeme is present, Following the bi imensional
array are various rules which include details and restrictions that are significant to the particular
sentence type under discussion. There are other rules, such as many co-occurrence restrictions on
the fillers of various slots, which arc unstated unless they seem particularly important in the
construction.","[109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115]"

   The analysis of this example (597) poses some interesting      lems. The surface structure is
marked first person singular (rather than second person singular) in the object in the Quotation,
ch-e-lepwee    ‘they are mourning me’.      Therefore it scems that this must be a Direct Quote
Sentence, However, this contradicts the general rule that all quotes embedded in direct quotes are
indirect instead of direct. Also this is the only example of Direct Quote Sentence encoding
Awareness. All other Direct Quote Sentences encode speech. Possibly       this is a case of surface
structure fusion of Direct and Indirect Quove Sentences. Or, possibly, this example indicates that
Direct and Indirect Quote Sentences should be redefined so that this cxample is an Indirect Quote

   The Explanatory Sentence is used to explain yarious procedures, rules, desires, customs, tind
also to explain the meaning of one language in snother, This sentence type is similar to the
Limitation Sentence in that it has not been observed embedded in any other sentence type, It
occurs in all types of discourse. In adklition to its explanatory function, this sentence type can be
used with the Explanatory slot deleted, as the closing formula in Procedure} Discourse and as the
closing formula for an Explanatory Paragraph,        When occurring with this closing function, the

7.2.8 AMPLIFICATION SENTENCE
   Amplification Semence is a very common       sentence type and is found in all typesof discourse,
                                                                            final base of a Narrative
SSS
S   SSS
     e other term present in the Statement slot; and {4) as a strong emphasis. or highlighting of the
 additional tagmeme not present.in the Statement slot.
    Amplification Sentence is identified by the repetition of the identical or closely 5 dine
 verb following a final intonation. In most cases theze is an additional Time, Location,         fective.
 Instrument, or Object Clause evel tagmeme occurring with the repetition of the verb, Occasionally
 the only expansion is an addirional stot in the verb or in a verb phrase,         It is this additional
 lagmeme, affix or verb phrase slot, crucial in distinguishing an Amplification Sentence from a
 repeated verb construction, which is onc of the few clear marks of a sentence boundary. In the
 repeated Verb construction, the verb is repeated in identical or abbreviated form with nothing added
 from the previous clause. In the Amplification Sentence something is nearly always added.
 Intonation also helps in distinguishing     these two constructions.    In the majority of cases, an
 unembedded Amplificalion Sentence will end with a final intonation, In the great majonty of cases
 of a repeated verb:construction, the repetition of the verb will be followed by a non-final
 intonation.
    The Amplification Sentence is similar to the Parallel Sentence, from which it is distinguished by
 the following contrastive fealures:
 (!) Number of bases: Ainplification Sentence is a two-base structure, while Parallel Sentence is
 multi-base,
 (2} The actors in Amplificition Sentence are identical in deep structure (i.e, reference)-and in
 95% of the examples in Surface struciure also, while in Parallel Sentence the actors can be same or
 different.
 (A) ‘The verbs in Amplification Sentence can be transitive or intransitive, while all examples:of
 Priutlel Sentence, excepr one, occur with transitive verbs,

"6.1    INDICATIVE CLAUSE TYPES
      Clause Matrix 1 (Table 11) indicates five basic clause types: transitive, intransitive, stative,
equational and chat             Distinctions benween these types ure summarised in Clause Matrix
2 (Table 12).   ‘The imperative, interrogative. yes/no question, and past and future negative
hear               hal these five basic types are derived by the transformations described in sctions
       2 to   6,
6.1.1 ‘TRANSITIVE CLAUSE
      The structure of the indicative transitive clause with the most frequent order of the optional
tagmemes is:
(Temporal)                       {Subject)                            Transitive Predicate
Temporal Word                    Apposition Noun Phrase               Compound Verb Stem
Temporal Phrase}                 Coordinate Noun Phrase               Modified Verb Phrase
                                 Modified Noun Phrase;                Repeated Verb Phrase
                                 Modified Noun Phrase?                Coordinate Verb Phrase
                                                                      Motion Verb Phrase
{Odject)                          (Indirect Object)                   (astrumental-Bencfactive)
Apposition Noun Phrase         — Apposition Noun Phrase               Instrumentil-Benefactive Phrase
Coordinate Non Phrase            Modified Noun Phise}
(Locative)                        (Modifier)
Locative Phrases                  enyudsk ‘like this’
Locative Phrasez                  namuduk like that’
                                                                                                         8l an Instrumental-Benefactive Phrase followed by an optional Locative tagmeme manifested by a
 Locative phrase of type 1, 2 or 3, followed by an pHeatl Modifier tagmeme minifested by
 enyudak ‘like this', namudak “like that’ or a Similarity Phrase.
 Rules:
 1, The Instrumental-Benefactive tagmeme occurs preceding the Object if used as Iastrumcnial
 and following the Object if used as Benefuctive.
2. Only transitive verbs (clisses 1 through4, and 8 and 9) can oceur manifesting the head
tagmemes of any of the verb phrases in the transitive Predicute slot.
3. The Temporal tagmeme can optionally occur following Object, giving Temporal agmeme
greater emphasis.
4, If ay other tagmeme except Temporal or Subject occurs precoiag the transitive Predicate, the
prepredicate tagmeme is assumed to be functioning as Sentence ‘Topic. This means that the
Topicatisation transformation has been applied to the transitive clause to transform it into a Simple
Sentence with Sentence Topic tagmeme occurring before the trinsitive Predicate. (See section 7.1
on Simple Sentence for details and examples. Also sce section 6.2.1 for details of the
Topicalisation transformation.)
5. Not all optional clause tigmemes can co-occur. Usually one, or at the most two or thiee
optional tagmemes occur with transitive Predicate, When the Modifier tw,        occurs, then itis
possible for three other optional tagmemes to co-occur (see example (443). If Object occurs,
    icect Object and Instrumental Benefactive cannot both occur.
6. The Modifier tagmeme occurs only if the transitive clause is manifesting the Explanation slot
ofan prpenaeey Paragraph (see section 8.5) or if the transitive Clause manifests the Quotation
“slot of a     Direct Quote Sentence or the Indirect Quotation slot of an Indirect Quote Sentence,
7. The Object tagmeme and possibly others (but not the predicate occurring clause final) can
optionally      be repeated for edditional emphasis or as an afterthought to add a small amount
                                                                                             of new
inf               (See example (443).
$. Long or repeated manifestations of optional tagmemes can be shifted to clause final position
(as in exumpte (443)),
      In all the following   analysed clause examples, square brackets indicate the filler of a tagmeme in
which the filler is soiee then one word.                                                             ;

6.0     INTRODUCTION
   A clause is defined as 8 construction containing one and only one predicate, equational,
lagmeme. This analysis makes no distinction berween dependent and independen                or topic
                                                                                     t clauses, nor
between medial and fina) clauses: The various relationships which some linguists
as dependent clauses are handled in this analysis as Temporal Clauses (6,1,7)        have described
                                                                                and in the sentence
analysis in section 7, This is because the morphemes signalling these relationships are separate
words or particles instead of affixes,                      ,
      There is no need to distinguish between final und medial clauses  final or media) verbs, since
there is only one general kind of verb affixation, Within cach verband class, the verb affixation Is
essentially the same regardless of where in a sentence the verb occurs,

analysed as Repeated Verb Phrase (RVP) or Coordinate Verb Phrase (CVP).
   There is ane example of one construction in which the verb stem pwe ‘to be’ occurs unaffixed
shea a fully affixed verb and evidently means continuous action. This is the Coordinate Verb
   rase in (423) below. The following examples include every observed instance of reduced verbs
except the imperatives mentioned above.

   The distinction between tight and loose sentences hus been made by                    acre (197020) ina
number of languages with varying degrees of success. Because it seems to              fit Teasonably well in
us 7h           i acated because at present no other meaningful arrangement of the sentence types can be
ound,    it s     used   here,.
   A tight sentence is a sentence type with relatively few deep structures, usuntly only one, A
loose sentence, on the other hand, has a relatively Jange number of different          structures which
are encoded, ranging from two 10 eight or ten, sepencing oa the degree of distinctions which arc
made in the deep structure types       subtypes,    Using this criterion, there are only four sentence
types which tum out to be borderline cases: Amplification Sentence, Cantrast Sentence, Direct
Case    Sthicace         eat Indirect Quote Sentcace. Contrast Sentence is categorised as loose because it
has slightly more differences in its deep structure than A        ication Sentence, On the basis of
frequency of encoding, the Direct Quote Sentence is classified as tight. It very rarely encodes
anything else but Speech. Indirect Quote Sentence, however, frequently encodes both Speech and
In(ent or Desire; therefore, ic is classified as loose, The Completed Action Sentence is an extra-
5 cing pte sentence, Table 13 indicates the arrangement of sentence types according to the
above     criterion,

"7.1   SIMPLE SENTENCE AND SENTENCE PERIPHERY
    The Simple Sentence is extra-systematic in that it has only one base, the Nucleus, while all
other sentence types haveat least two bases, ‘The Nucleus contains cither one clause or one clause
containing one or tore ombedded clauses. A Simple Sentence is distinguished from a clause by
the presence of one or more peripheral tagmemes:
    These peripheral tagmemes oceur with many and probubly all sentence types. ‘To avoid
repetition they will be described here along with Simple Sentence, rather than repeating them in the
discussion of cach sentence type, The somewhat free orderof these lagmemes is as follows:
Sentence Conjunction, Vocative, Response, Sentence Topic, Remark, ‘T               Margin, Nucleus,
Afterthought. Of these peripheral tagmemes, Response, Sentence Topic, Remark, Temporal
Margin and Afterthought can occur with a sentence which is embedded tn another sentence, and
ure therefore defined as the Inner Periphery, Sentence Conjunction and Vocative are designated
Outer Pesipheral because they do not occur with an embedded sentence except occasionally within
a Direct Quote Sentence. For the fillers manifesting these various peripheral tagmemes, see the
bidimensional array for Simple Sentence, section 7.1.3,7.1.1   INNER PERIPHERY

   Hortatory Discourse involves exhortation for some individual ar group to change
behaviour.   The common features are second person plural verbs in
                                                                                        their

rhetorical questions, extensive use of Conditional Sentence, Warningthe Semence,   Negative
Sentence, Parallel Sentence, and a Motivation tagmeme near the end of the
                                                                                  discourse. The
     graphs are marked by time words, eli ‘and, then, and so, but’, change of person and
                                                                                           number

   Procedural Discourse is characterised by many repeated verb constructions,
meme and a definite lack of internal structure. The only formal markings for internal structure
other than the peripheral tagmemes of Aperture, Stage, Closure, and Finis are. temporul words
which correlate somewhat with the Continuation Sentences and also the verb -atuk ‘finish’, which
has been used as an indication of paragraph boundaries,
   Procedural Discourse is used to describe a process either currently practiced or one which was
practiced long ago and is presently practiced only infrequently or not at all. There are three
subtypes depending on the type of process being described and also on the attinade of the narrator.
These three subtypes are termed Autobiographical, General, and Specific.
   In Autobiographical Procedural Discourse, the focus is on the narrator as a real or hypothetical
participant. It is told in first person singular, irrealis. mood,
   General Procedural Discourse is used when the narrator is not necessarily involved in the
procedure, This type occurs in irreslis mood, either first person seme or third person plural mixed
cae The propenures involving ancient customs, some of which           aré not currently practiced, are
included in this subtype. ‘They are almost always told in third person plural mixed gender.
                                                                            rocedures. ‘They are told

a numberr of procedures to the author, Each Procedure discourse level tagmeme is munifested by 9
brief embedded discourse. This may explain why this texthas one unique feature. The Procedure
tagmemes are bordered by a stereotyped Equational Clause,
       aneny — bolany = namudak,
         some one talk         like that
         ""One story is like that.’
This Equutional Clause seems to serve a triple function, It is the conclusion of one Procedure, the
Finis of the embedded distourse, and the Aperture of the following embedded discourse.

7.3.8 PARALLEL SENTENCE
   The Parallel Scatence is a myelti-base structure which links together by juxtaposition clauses
and/or sentences with identical predication in which one corresponding term in éach predication is
changed. The clauses or sentences are either joined in temporal pea or simply conjoined
because of similar subject matter and roughly similar temporal sett ng. In this fatter case the
Parallel Sentence describes a series of events somehow unified without focusing on the temporal
sequence, Unless there are specific lexical clucs given (as is true in (709) and (710) encoding
Succession), it is not possible to tell whether or not Succession or Conjoining is encoded.
However, the author was on cycwitness to the events described in the (711) encoding Succession,
sa in that case, itis known that the order is significant ~ that is, it coincides with the chronological
order.

   A Loose Sentence was defined in section 7,2 asa sentence type which encodes a relatively large
number of different deep              structures. On this basis the following sentence types are classified
“loose” in contrast to “tight”.
148non-final intonation never occurs following the link umru, alitough a final intonation often
precedes the urnti,
   The Purpose Sentence occurs frequently in Narrative and Explanatory Sentences; embedded in
Base) and Base slots of the Narrative Sentence.
      Although Purpose Scatence is marked by the umu link and the intonation as stated above, this
construction is nol always casy to recognise.            Not every sentence-medial uni marks a Purpose
Sentence, The two most Common exceptions to this are the constructions in which the umu marks
an embedded clause or sentence and those in which wri simply marks a Benefactive clause-levet
slot.
   The following example illustrates both uses of umu. The first wu following redim ‘prepare’
occurs with bulguh ‘pigs’ in a Benefoctive Relutor-Axis Phrase filling the Benefactive slot in the
clause, ‘They will go and prepare for pigs’. The second umu is the next to the lust word in the
sentence. It marks the embedded clause alkiidb chichtikalas umu ‘the coconut leaves with which
they had covered up the slit gong drums’. In an embedded construction the umu often occurs
sentence finally, If it occurs sentence medially, it is usually followed by a final intonation.

7.3.7 CONTRAST SENTENCE
   Contrast Sentence is a two-base strocture ideatified by a negation and unreal aspect in the fillers
of Base; and real or imperative aspect with the absence of negation in Buse2. This sentence typeis
uscd (0 express a contrast between two opposites, oF to restate a similar statement using a negated
antonym,
   Contrast Sentence is similar in structure to Evaluation Sentence from which it is distinguished
by the following contrastive features:
(1) Significant difference in fillers of re        epee bases: Contrast Sentence has Base, and Base?
expounded by only       an Indicative Clause of Narrtive Sentence, while Evaluation Sentence has its
first base expe           by a wide variety of phrases, clauses, and sentences. The second base of
Evaluation       Sentence can be expounded by a closed class of words or phrases, or by =» Topic(2). Contrast Sentence is a two-base structure while Evaluation Sentence is potentially-a multi-
base structure,
{3) com base in Evaluation Sentence is often negated, while Base in the Contrast Sentence
 never

                                   temporal stem
That is, an Apposition Noun Phrase consists of an obligatory Head slot manifested by onc of a
variety of fillers: a Coordinate Noun Phrase, another Apposition Noun Phrase and Intensive
Phrase, a demonstrative, a-pronaun, a. temporal stem, or a class 18 noun (place name), The Head
stot is followed by an obligatory Apposition slot manifested by either a Modified Noun Phrase), &
Coordinate Noun Phrase, a nominalised clause, 2 derived noun stem, a class 17 or 18 noun (i.e. 0
personal name ora place name), a pronoun, a temporal stem, of a clause, The apposition slot is
followed by an optional identification slot manifested by a pronoun.
                                                               penton
above, Apposition Noun Phrase occurs filling the Subject,     Object and Indirect Object slots in
transitive and intransitive clauses and the Topic slot in Topic-Comment clauses, and in the
Modifier slot of all types of Modified Noun Phrases,
Rules:
 t. If Head is manifested by a pronoun, Apposition is not, and conversely.
2. oy two levels of self-embedding of Apposilion Noun Phrase in the Head slot have been
observed.

3.4.5 DIRECTIONAL SUFFIXES
   The directionals in Table 4 are -w ‘displaced reference’, (-i) ‘motion toward speaker’, and
(-tik} “permanent aspect’.
   The morpheme -uv is used to sigan! motion to a place distinct from that where the speaker and
hearer are.at the time of Speaking. 1 is used only with motion verbs or verbs that are semantically
compatible with a motion verb,

      *Tomorrow I will take the things and bring them to where you (ihe hearer) will be.""
   The morpheme {-i} “motion toward speaker’, is used to signal motion in the direction of the
speaker, There are two different allomorphs:
lf occurs following vowels;
+f occurs elsewhere.
This morpheme {i} is illustrated in (90) and (91).
20   The morpheme f-1ik) is semantically complex. Although usually glassed as PERM (permunent
aspect) for iy & it does not mean metely permanent aspect. When occurring with an
intransitive verb, It signals that the agent went to another place and remained there. When
occurring with a verb that takes a patient as well as an agent, however, this suffix signals not only
that the patient remained at a given location, but also that the agent did not remain there but went to

     In (92) the suffix -ik means not only that the sago leaves remained but that the speaker
                                                                                           went to

3.4.6 MORPHEMIC ALTERNATION IN VERB STEMS
   There are a number of changes in verb stems which occur when the verb occurs with an object
affix (a member of <-unil> defined in the context of Table 6). Many of these changes are
explained by the morphophonemi¢ rules in section 2. Miuny of the others are caplained by the
following additional partially ordered cules which ppoarently apply only at morpheme boundaries,
The rules are numbered beginning with number 19, which follows the last morphophonemic nile
Of section 2, number 18,RULE 19: we deletion: C(C)¥ + w+ CXC),
                                      illustrate

                                                  Rule 19. (94) 6first establishes            of a verb stem
                                                                                 the presence of

From this point on in the examples illustrating rules 19 through 24, each example shows a free
object which is then replaced by the corresponding object affix to show the change which occurs,

‘The intensive imperative prefix kwV is used only in a very Himited number  of situations.in which it
is necessary to give commands to fellow-workers on a group project, or fo command children,
such as when someone clse is unknowingly blocking the path into ahouse. To vse it in any other
situation is an indicationof anger on the part of the speaker and may result in a fight. Part  of the
restrictions on the use of it may be due to the fact that it is identical in form with the third singular
feminine indicative verb forms, which may result in ambiguity.                  The usual rule for V is:
        V = wif the following vowelin the verb stemis w,
        V = Jif the following vowel in the verb stem is tf,
        V =a otherwise.

7.2.9 SUCCESSION SENTENCE
   The Succession Sentence consists of two bases and is used to conjoin clauses in temporal
succession. The link douk frequently indicates a very shor time between the event described in the
two bases.
  This sentence type is used mainly by the Chamaun dialect group, and is used by some speakers
mach more frequently than others.
  The link douk xiso occasionally functions on a higher level in addition to its linking function in
this sentence type. In the first two examples it signals the entrance of a new participant or the ré-
introduction of previous participants who will begin a new episode in the narrative.
    The same particle douk oxcurs in other contexts besides this sentence type. Most frequently it
occurs atthe beginning of anew paragraph.","[155, 156]"

   There are a very limited number of verb roots, descriptives, and nouns borrowed from Tok
Pisin which have been observed manifesting corez tagmeme. Note that some verb roots from Tok
Pisin are also noun roots (j.c. fakis “taxes or toll, to pay taxes or toll’).
Verb roots borrowed from Tok Pisin:

      Compound verb stem occurs manifesting the verb nucleus tagmeme in class 2, 4, and-5 verbs,
Which class occurs depends on whether the Tok Pisin form coupled with the verb ne to do*

    Reflexive verb stems are formed by the application of the Reflexive Transformation to the verb
root, This transformation applics to verb root 3 and verb root 4, and consists of adjoining na-
‘refiexiviser’ to the left of the verb root.

7.3.2. CONDITIONAL SENTENCE
    The Conditional Sentence is 1 wwo-base structure occurring in a wide vuriety of paragraph and
discourse types. Itis identified by the optional conditional inarker sapos ‘if’, the Link expounded
by non-final intonation, all verbs in the same aspect (95% of the time irrealis aspect), and frequent
negation in the Condition base, This sentence type is used         primarily to express a hypothetical
condition but occasionally to express Contrafsctuality or            ncy. The verbs in the Condition
and Result bases ure in the real aspect if the sentence encodes      bniare This sentence type is
similar to the Contrary to. Fact Conditional Sentence but is distinguis    tom it by the following
contrastive features:
(1) Conditional Sentence has jts link manifested by non-final intonation only, the Contrary to
Fact Conditional Sentence Link is manifested by fe.
(2) The Condition base of Contrary to Fact Conditional Sentences does not occur negated, while
Condition base in Conditional Sentence can be. This isnot a conclusive contrast because ir is
possible that in a larger corpus Contrary to Fact Conditional Sentence will occur with a negated
Condition base.

Rules:
1. A Nominalised Clause expounds Condition base only if the sentence encodes Contingency.
2. If the sentence encodes Contingency, the verbs in both bases can be in real aspect. However;
the sentence
           can also encode Contingency with all verbs in unreal aspect.
3. With sentences encoding all other deep structures except Contingency, verbs in both bases
must be unreal aspect,
4. Bither or both bases can be negated_
5. If the Link does not occur, either the Condition Base is manifested by an involved embedded
construction and terminated by final intonation or else the sentence encodes contingericy.
6. In one example ((630) encoding Hypothetical) it seems that Condition base is repeated. This
is interpreted as a false start. This same example also is unique in that the Link is expounded by
orait ‘then’ as well as the non-final intonation,

   The embedding involved in Conjunction Sentences can be fairly complex. The general principle
of analysis used is that embedding beyond three layers is considered improbable and too complex
for easy decoding by the hearer, This follows Yngve's depth hypothesis (Yngve 1964:135-138).
That js, one Conjunction Sentence is allowed to embed another if this docs not result in more than
three layers of embedding in the entire sentence, Instead, the remaining occurrences of olf joining
clauses or sentences
                   are analysed as sppecitions of Link2 and Basez. The repetitions of up to four
consecutive strings of clauses joined     by off have been analysed using these principles to avoid
more than three layers of embedding,

1247.2.3, CONTINUATION SENTENCE
   Continuation Sentence is identified by the link aliga ‘continue until’ with or without other
conjunctions and/or Sopeitions of aliga, which are discussed in the rules following the
bidimensional array. It is used to join clauses and or sentences in temporal succession with a
particular relationship between thems: the first action or state is viewed as continuing over 9 span of
time, Jong or short, until another punctiliar event or action spread over a period of time occurs,although it does occur embedded in Purpose Sentence, Conjunction Sentence, and Narrative
Sentence, Continuation Sentence occurs in al] major discourse types and in most paragraph types,
although most frequently in the various types of narrative discourse,      In homatory discourse this
sentence type is rare, and so far occurs only embedded in a Narrative Sentence, Within Narrative
Discourses which frequently shift location, such as travel narratives, Continuation Sentence very
frequently functions as the transitional sentence which signals the movement from one place to
another. As such, Continuation sentence is often right at the border of two parugraphs, marking
either the end of one paragraph or the beginning of another.","[132, 133, 134]"

repetition of the same person (second pease or first person plural) as subject, and repetition of the
imperanive aspect, but ragrrag ine ge is by simple juxtaposition or by the generally anaphoric
demonstrative namudak ‘like that; like this"" seed cataphorically (see first ee            101),
