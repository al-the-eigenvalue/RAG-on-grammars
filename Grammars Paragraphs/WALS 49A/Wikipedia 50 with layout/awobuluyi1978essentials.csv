 Serial verbal sentences are formed by combining parts of                             in meaning. Partly for this reason, they are not formed
                                                                                                                                                    by
 simple sentences. Thus, the example given above was formed                           combining simple sentences.
 by combining the following two simple sentences:                                       _ To see this, consider the following serial verbal sentence
              O ji eran.                     (He stole meat.)                         given earlier:
            O je eran.           (He ate meat.)
                                                                                           O ji eran je.          (He stole some meat and ate it.)

 about a change in meaning. For example:

The type of sentences referred to by this term can be exemplified   is:

Not much is known at present about how such sentences are           Generally speaking, sentences with the particle nf sound more
formed. They seem to be related to serial verbal sentences.         elegant than synonymous sentences without it.
However, their meanings, unlike the meanings of serial verbal

                                                                                                 Furthermore, a topical qualifier, like other qualifiers,
          This kind of lengthening normally does not occur when

              ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
My indebtedness to earlier writers on the Yoruba Language
will be apparent on many of the pages of this book and is
readily admitted in the Introduction. Beyond that, I am
deeply grateful to my past students at the Universities of
Lagos and Ibadan, and my colleagues in those two institutions
as well as at the University of Ife. It was the former who
first began pressing me to write this book, and they together
with the latter helped considerably in their different ways to
clarify my thoughts on the language. Lastly, but not in the
least,   I am grateful to Mr. S. F. Odebo   who patiently and
expertly typed the entire book from manuscript.

                  INTRODUCTION
There has existed for quite some time now a keenly felt need
for a simple, straightforward, comprehensive, and scientific
book on Yoruba grammar for use in Grammar Schools,
Colleges, and introductory courses for undergraduates. The
present one, it is hoped, will go some way in filling that need.
      The book is an abridged version of a much longer work
in progress. As such, it contains for the most part and as its
title suggests only the barest facts of the structure of the
language as perceived by the author in part from ‘his close
study of earlier works on the same subject and in part from
his own on-going independent research begun almost a
decade ago. Not only does the book omit criticisms of tradi-
tional misconceptions, detailed arguments, and long proofs,
except where they are considered absolutely necessary for
comprehension,   but,   because      of its introductory     character,
it also avoids as much of the technical language of Modern
Linguistics as it safely can.
      The book attempts to present the grammatical structure
of the Yoruba language in a genuinely modern (but not
ultramodern) way. For this reason, most readers are going
io find in it much that is new or untraditional. For example,
the consistent employment of function as the only criterion
for establishing the major parts of speech of the language,
the claim’ that words like ki4kié (quickly), wéréwéré (quickly)
are nouns and not adverbs, the claim that all but two of the
verbs presently existing in the language are transitive, and
the claim that qualifiers always follow the nouns they qualify.
Such claims may be new, but they all follow very logically
from long-established but easily overlooked facts of the
language. Thus, to give one simple example, the word gbogbo
(entirety) in these two sentences:     Mo na gbogbo ow6 n4a.               (I spent all the money.)
     Mo na gbogbo ré.                    (I spent it all.)                                  xiil

is analysed as a noun in the present book. This analys                         because they would at least in theory appreciably simplify

      (a) The word 7? is a qualifier. (Given/known fact).                      Thus, 6 f¢ ’#lp sf apd dhun as just written means only ‘He, she,
      (6) This same word is mutually substitutable with owé                    or it wants to go in that direction’. Written as 6 f¢ lp sf apd
            nda in the first sentence; hence owé ndé is a qualifier            dhtin, however, as has been suggested in some quarters, this
            also.                    ‘                                         sentence would not have only the meaning given it earlier,
      (c) Qualifiers    occur   with   nouns only.                             it would also mean ‘It blew in that direction’. In other words,
      (d) The qualif   iers  r?  and   owé ndd@ occur with gbogbo in           the hitherto accepted way of writing the language does not

       All the other claims in this book have been arrived at                  direction’. It represents these two utterances ambiguously.

1.1   Any     given language      is made      up of syntactic classes of
words';     that   is, words   that   behave       in a similar   way   in the
sentences of the language.            Such   classes of words are tradi-
tionally referred to as parts of speech. The primary job of
the grammarian of any language is (1) to establish the number
and types of syntactic classes of words in the language, and
(2) to-describe how individual members of such classes of
words are combined to form acceptable sentences or utter-
ances in the language. A good description must be straight-
forward and easy to follow.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"

The actual distinguishing feature of the class as a whole is                   the language. For example,

This is true of all the three examples given above.                             First, roboto and kidkié cannot be adjectives in the above two
      Some people regularly leave out such a preposition from                  sentences because they do not qualify any nouns there, as
some expressions other than the ones given here. For example,                  every adjective must do (see Chapter 3). They are not adverbs

1.2 There is no fixed number of parts of speech that must
be found in every language. In other words, some languages
have more parts of speech than others. This being the case,
it is no use for someone warting to find out how many parts
of speech there are in Yoruba to look to Hausa, or Igbo, or
English for guidance. Such a person must find guidance for
himself within the Yoruba language itself and there only.
1.3   To ask how many parts of speech are in Yoruba is to
ask how many syntactic classes Yoruba words can be divided
or sub-classified into. If Yoruba words can be sub-classified
into ten groups,       then there are ten parts of speech in the
language.",[9]
