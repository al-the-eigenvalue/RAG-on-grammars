§2.4. Nominal predicates.
      Tagalog nominals, whether serving as predicates or occurring in other sentence positions, may be
divided into two large classes: MARKED and UNMARKED, A masked nominal is a nominal whose
function in a sentence is always explicitly indicated in one of the two following ways: (1) by the form of
the nominal itself, or (2) by the form of a preceding MARKER. (A marker is a word that indicates the
grammatical function of another word or group of words.) Tagalog has three types of marked
nominals:   PERSONAL      PRONOUNS,          DEICTIC        PRONOUNS   (sometimes   called   DEMONSTRATIVE
PRONOUNS), and PERSONAL NOUNS (in general, nouns that name specific persons). In the case of
personal and deictic pronouns, the function of the pronoun in the sentence is always marked by its own
form. In the case of personal nouns, the function of the noun in the sentence is always indicated by the
form of a preceding marker.
      Tagalog has eight personal pronouns and four deictic pronouns. Each of these pronouns occurs in one
of three different forms according to its function in the sentence. (The preceding statement is a slight
oversimplification in the case of the second-person-singular pronoun and that of the composite pronoun
kita: cf. §3.3.) These are, of course, a great many personal nouns, but all are marked by a single set of
three markers, one for each of three different kinds of sentence functions. (For the pluralization of these
markers, cf. §3.9).
       Complete lists of the forms of the deictic and personal pronouns are given in § §3.3 and 3.4
respectively. The personal-noun markers are summarized in §3.5. For present purposes, it is necessary to
present only the forms that occur in predicate-nominal position. These are:
        a). the following personal pronouns:
                 ako      T                    kami   = ‘T_and others/we*
                 kata     ‘you and I/we""       tayo     ‘you and I (and others)/we’
                 ikaw     ‘you’                kayo     ‘you (and others)""
                 siya     ‘he/she’             sila     ‘he and others/she and others/they’        b). the following deictic pronouns:
                 ire                  ‘this’                          iyan                   ‘that’
                 ito                  *this’                          iyon                   “that?","[73, 74]"
"
§3.3.     Personal pronouns.
        The forms of the personal pronouns are given in Chart 7. On the chart, the pronouns are arranged in
two groups: NON-PLURAL and PLURAL. (The first group is called non-plural rather than singular because
it included dual pronouns, meaning literally ‘you (singular) and I’. The plural pronouns have, as a group, the
meanings of the corresponding non-plural pronouns with the additional meaning ‘and others’ (or ‘and
another’): thus the first-person plural is literally ‘I and others’, the dual plural ‘you (singular) and I and
others’, etc. For each pronoun, both the conventional spellings and a phonemic transcription are given. For
the sake of simplicity, only subject pronouns (c.g., ‘I') are shown in the English translations, although in
many cases an ang form may actually correspond to an English object pronoun (e.g., ‘me*), ang form toa
possessive pronoun (e.g., ‘my’, ‘mine’), and asa form (o either an object pronoun or a possessive pronoun.
The translations on the chart are, in any case, only approximate. (See below for details about the use and
English equivalents of the Tagalog pronouns.)                                                       CHART 7

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                                                      89       As the chart shows, Tagalog distinguishes eight different categories of personal pronouns: a
non-plural and a plural of the first person, the dual, the second person, and the third person. One of these
categories, the second-person non-plural, is represented by four distinct forms:                    two ang forms (ikaw and
ka, predicate and topic forms respectively — cf. §2.13), a ng form, and a sa form. The other seven
categories are represented by three forms each.
       The first-person singular — ako/ko/akin — is the only category of Tagalog personal pronouns that
corresponds      with     perfect    consistency       to   a   category   of      English      pronouns        (the     first-person
singular: ‘I/me/my/mine’). In other cases, a single Tagalog category corresponds                            to several English
categories and/or several Tagalog categories to a single English category.
      The     Tagalog    dual   non-plural — Kata/nita/kanita -- corresponds           to the     English   first-person       plural
(‘we/us/our/ours’) when the latter is used to refer to the speaker and a single individual addressed. The dual
non-plural is thus, literally, ‘you (singular) and I’. Dual non-plural pronouns are obsolescent in educated
Manila Tagalog, and many speakers do not use them at all, using the dual plural — sayo/natin/atin — for
‘you (singular) and I’ as well as ‘you (plural) and I’; sce below.
      The Tagalog second-person singular — ikaw/ka/mo/iyo -- corresponds to the English sccond-person
(‘you/your/yours’) when the latter is used to address a single individual who is a relative belonging to a
younger generation, a friend, a social inferior, or — in the case of children and adolescents — an age-mate;
the secund-person non-plural is also used in addressing God. In addressing single individuals who do not fit
into one of these categories, the second-person singular is replaced by the sccond-person or third-person
plural; see below. (As was noted in §2.13, there is a special composite pronoun kita /kitah/ that combines
the meanings of a first-person-singular mg form and a second-person-singular ang form. Kita thus occurs in
place of the non-occurring sequences *ku ka and *ka ko).
      The      Tagalog     third-person     singular — siya/niya/kaniya — corresponds              (o   both       the    masculine
third-person singular (‘he/him/fhis’) and the feminine third-person singular (‘she/her/hers’) in cases where
these English pronouns refer to human beings, or to pet animals. The Tagalog third-person singular also
corresponds to the English neuter third-person singular (‘it/its’) in the few cases in which the latter is used
to refer to a baby or a pet animal. The range of English counterparts for siya/niya/kaniya is illustrated
below:                                           ang lalaki
                                           ang babae.
                 Wala rito                                             Nasa bukid siya.
                                           ang sanggol.
                                           ang aso ko.","[98, 99]"
"      Tagalog sentences that include nominal or adjectival predicates may conveniently be grouped together
into a single class of EQUATIONAL          SENTENCES; sentences that include verbal predicates may be called
NARRATIONAL SENTENCES. Tagalog equational sentences differ from their English translation-equiv-
alents in the following principal ways: (1) the absence of a linking verb like English be; (2) the absence,
in the case of indefinite nominal predicates, of an indefinite article like English a/an; (3) word order, the
Tagalog predicate being sentencc-initial, the English predicate sentence-final. The first of these differences
applies in all cases: the equivalent of be in Tagalog is simply the cquational structure itself, the nominal or
adjectival predicate plus the topic. (An equational sentence may be translated with a present or a past form
of English be, according to the context.) The second of the differences docs not apply in the case of
adjectival predicates (or in the case of marked-nominal or definite predicates — cf. §2.4 for a discussion of
marked nominals, and §7.17 for a discussion of definitization of the predicate).
      The third difference between Tagalog cquational sentences and                      their   English   translation
equivalents — word order — exists in the case of all basic equational sentences. But Tagalog does have
certain non-basic sentence types, both equational and narrational, in which the topic precedes the predicate
(cf. §7.2).
       Tagalog narrational sentences fail to correspond to their English translation-equivalents in a variety of
ways, some of which have already been mentioned. The difference between English and Tagalog in the
order of the components of basic sentences obtains in the case of narrational, as in that of equational
sentences. And, as was noted above, the subject of an English narrational sentence frequently corresponds
to part of the Tagalog predicate.
62                                                                                                              CHAPTER 2       But even where there is considerable surface correspondence between a Tagalog narrational sentence
and its English counterpart, there is a fundamental, if subtle, difference between them. This difference has
to do with the status of verbs and nouns in the two languages. The distinction between verbs and nouns in
English is a basic and far-reaching one. English verbs and nouns occur in few, if any, of the same contexts.
Tagalog verbs and nouns, on the other hand, have many contexts in common. Not only can both nouns and
verbs serve as predicates, but there is virtually no context in which a noun occurs in which it cannot be
replaced by a verb or verb phrase. Thus, for example, a verb like yumaman ‘got rich’ or a verb phrase like
nagluto ng pagkain ‘cooked some food’ may, like a noun, occur in topic position after ang: ¢.g.,                  Artista ang yumaman.
                  ‘The one who got rich is an actress.”","[71, 72]"
"§1.30 Spelling and pronunciation.
      Written Tagalog uses the same letters as does written English. The seven letters c, f,j,q,v, x, and z,
however, occur chiefly in proper nouns of foreign origin and in certain other borrowings from English or
Spanish; for example:
      c        Carlos            (man's name)                    q       Quirino              (family name)

               mag-fishing       ‘go fishing’                            vanilla              ‘vanilla’
PRONUNCIATION                                                                                                                 37      j          Jose                  (man’s name)                              x      Roxas                 (family name)

                 zipper                ‘zipper’      These seven letters are not included in the conventional Tagalog alphabet, which consists of twenty
letters, in the following order:                                    abkdefhilmnngoprstuwy(Note that ug is conventionally considered a single Ictter.)
      Tagalog spelling is very much more consistent than English spelling in reflecting pronunciation.
Except in the case of certain borrowed words, and in a few other cases to be noted below, each of the
above twenty letters is consistently used to represent a single phoneme, and each phoneme is consistently
represented by a single Ietter.
      Two      Tagalog     phonemes,    /n/ and /t8/, are conventionally symbolized                   by digraphs: ng and ts
respectively, as in:      bangko              [banko/                ‘bank’                 tsa             fkahf                    ‘tea’
      hanggang            {hanga-n/              ‘until’                litser          [ti Ber/                 “teacher”

by the Institute of National Language, a system that has not been generally adopted in popular Tagalog
writing). When /’/ occurs word-initially, however, its presence may be inferred from the conventional
spelling, which, in such cases, always begins with a vowel letter (a, e, i, 0, or u); for example:                 asin                                      [asin                                    “salt”

word-final /’/ nor word-final /h/ is represented in conventional spelling, pairs of words that differ only in
that one of them ends in /*/ and the other in /h/, are spelled in the same way:      bata             fba‘ta’/        “child®                                   bata      foa‘tah/             ‘bathrobe’

represented in conventional writing by consonant-iy and consonant-uw respectively, whether or not there is

      Conventional spelling normally reflects changes of vowel quality as a result of length shift in the
presence of the suffixes -an and -in (see § 1.12):      tiket /ti-ket/ ‘ticket’                   _—          tikitan /tiki-tan/ ‘to give a ticket’
      palo /pa‘lo? ‘flogging’                   _—e         paluin /palu’’in/ ""to flog’Changes of vowel quality under other circumstances (see §§1.7, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12) are not normally
reflected in the spelling. For example, the spellings Kayo and po are used consistently in the following
sentences, although kayo is /kayoh/ in the fisst sentence and /kayu/ in the second and third, while po is
{po / in the second sentence and /pu:/ in the third:                Kayo. /kayoh/ ‘You.*
                Kayo po. /kayu po’/ ‘You, sir.’
                Kayo po ba? /kayu pu’ bah/ ‘You, sir?’      Length is not indicated in conventional written Tagalog. Such pairs of words as the following are
therefore spelled identically:      bukas            fou'kas/        ‘tomorrow’           bukas           foukas/           ‘open’
      galing           /ga‘lin/        ‘fron’               galing           /galin/          ‘excellence’       There are two very common words — the complement and possessive marker ng (cf. § §2.12, 2.14,
3.20, etc.) and the plural marker snga (cf. §§3.9 4.11, etc.) — whose conventional spelling does not reflect
their pronunciation. Ng represents /nan/; mga represents /mana/.

Basic   Sentence   Structure
BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE                                                                                       59§2.1. Introduction
      This chapter outlines the grammatical structure of certain basic sentence types in Tagalog. The
sentence types whose structure is outlined are considered basic for two reasons: first, they are, in general,
the shortest and simplest types of complete sentences that occur in the language; second, the structure of
other, more complex, types of sentences may be described as resulting from particular elaborations or
combinations of elements from the basic sentence types. An example from English may serve to clarify this
second point. The sentences               John ate the apple.
               Mary ate the pear.may be considered representative of a certain basic type of English sentence. Once the grammatical
structure of this sentence type has been adequately described, the structure of the sentences               The apple was eaten by John.
               The pear was eaten by Mary.may be quite simply accounted for as a particular rearrangement of (and certain particular additions to) the
elements of the first set of sentences. Similarly, the structure of the sentences               John ate the apple and Mary ate the pear.
               John ate the apple: Mary, the pear.may be quite simply accounted for as particular combinations of these elements. Elements of the sentence
types considered basic serve, in short, as the building blocks with which the other sentence types of the
language are constructed. It follows that a description of the grammatical structure of the basic sentence
types will facilitate the description of the full range of sentence types that occur.
       The outline of basic Tagalog sentence structures presented in this chapter is followed, in succceding
chapters, by a more detailed examination of certain components of basic sentences. The outline itself
contains an ordered inventory of basic-sentence components, together with a preliminary discussion of the
internal structure of the components and the kinds of meanings they express. The inventory moves from
the more general to the more specific:       that is, from the components that all Tagalog basic sentences have in
common, to those that distinguish the various types and subtypes of basic sentences from one another.
      The structure of a basic sentence may be viewed as a branching diagram. For example, the structure
of the English basic sentence John loves Mary may be diagrammed as follows:                                     Basic     Sentence                  Subject                                 Predicate
                                             Verb                 Object
               Proper Noun                                     Proper Noun                   John                      Loves                    MaryA diagram of this kind presents, as one moves from the top to the bottom, a number of progressively more
specific characterizations of the structure of the sentence. Thus the most general characterization of the
sentence above is that it is a basic sentence. Increasingly specific characterizations of the sentence, involving
progressively more refined and limited components, are:

                b. Subject + Verb + Object
                c. Proper Noun + Verb + Proper Noun
                d. John + loves + MaryCharacterizations b, ¢, and d distinguish John loves Mary from progressively larger groups of English
sentences.   Thus   while   characterization   a, Subject
                                                     + Predicate,     applies   to a sentence   like    John   ran,
characterization b, Subject + Verb + Object. does not; and, while characterization b applies to a sentence
like John ate the apple, characterization c, Proper Noun + Verb + Proper Noun, does not. Finally,
characterization d distinguishes John loves Mary from all the other sentences of English.
      Branching diagrams of the kind just illustrated are used from time to time in the course of the
following presentation of Tagalog basic-sentence structure, both as a way of keeping track of the different
sentence structures under description and as a way of representing graphically the hierarchical relations
between the more general and the more specific components of basic sentences.","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70]"

it has no overt equivalent in Tagalog. Thus:                                                      baka.

                  ‘The cars       The third-person plural is occasionally used as a substitute for the second-person plural in addressing
one or more persons. Used in this way, the third-person plural indicates great respect and very marked
social distance. It was formerly used, for example, by subjects addressing monarchs, and might now be
used, especially in writing, by a humble citizen addressing an august politial personal.
       The third-person plural is also occasionally used as a substitute for the third-person singular in
referring to a respected personage. Thus a child might use the third-person plural in referring to one of its
parents.

the other hand, are in most cases preceded by the marker sa. Sa regularly fails to occur before the sa form
of a pronoun only where the pronoun is used as a possessive modifier (cf. §3.20), and is optional when the
pronoun occurs in a possessive predicate (cf. §4.22) or after the comparative marker Kaysa (cf. §4.15). In
all other cases, sa obligatorily precedes the sa form of a personal pronoun.
      (In certain specifiable cases, the ang and ng forms of the personal pronouns obligatorily occur in
sentence positions that are either distinct from those occupied by nominals of other types, or not
obligatory in the case of nominals of other types. Details are presented in §3.29.)
§3.4.      Deictic Pronouns.
      Tagalog distinguishes four categories of deictic, or demonstrative, pronouns. The ang, ng, and sa
forms of these pronouns are shown in Chart 8. In the discussion that follows the chart, the ag forms are
used to signify the entire category, unless otherwise specified.

                                                   noon /nu‘on{
92                                                                                                            CHAPTER 3
(The forms shown on the chart are the most common forms of the deictics. In addition to these forms, the
following literary variants occur: yart /yarih/, niyari /nyarih/, and yaon /ya‘on{ — variants of, respectively,
ire, nire, and iyon. In informal conversation, iyon is sometimes pronounced /yu'on/.)
        English distinguishes only two categories of deictic pronouns: ‘this’ and ‘that’. (The English deictics
have, however, distinctive plural forms, ‘these’ and ‘those’; for pluralization of the Tagalog deictics, cf.
$3.9.) Each of the English categories corresponds to two Tagalog catcgories: ‘this’ to both ire and ito,
that’ to both iva and iyon.
      Some Tagalog speakers use ire and ito interchangeably to refer to things close to the speaker
(approximately within arm's reach). Others make a distinction between the two, using ire for things in
actual contact with the speaker's body (c.g., something in the speaker's hand or something worn) and ito as
a more general category indicating proximity to the speaker. Still others — possibly a majority of educated
Manila speakers — use ire rarely or not at all.
       A much more consistent distinction is made in the case of iyan and iyon. Jan is used to refer to
things close to the person(s) addressed (approximately within arm’s reach) and less close to the speaker,
while iyon is used to refer to things close to neither the speaker nor the person(s) addressed. (As Chart 8
shows, ivan has two ng forms, niyon and nuon. These forms are free alternants. Thus:                                  niyon
                Uminom                            ang bata.
                                  noon
                ‘The child drank some of that.’)       Like English, Tagalog uses deictic pronouns to refer to abstractions, situations, actions, etc., as well as
to concrete    objects.   In   these     cases,   the choice         of deictic category   is a matter   of ‘psychological
proximity -- whether the abstraction, etc., is felt to be closely identified with the speaker, with the hearer
but not the speaker, or with neither. If the abstraction, etc. is felt to be closely identified with the speaker,
ite (or ire) is used: if it is felt to be closely identified with the hearer but not the speaker, /yart is used; if, as
is perhaps most often the case, it is felt to be closely identified with neither the speaker nor the hearer, jyon
is used. Some examples are:                                                           ire.

                 ‘That      The Tagalog deictics may be used to refer to people, in which case (as in certain other cases) they
must often be translated ‘this one’ or ‘that one’ in English: ¢.g.,                Maglalaba ito; magpaplantsa iyon.
                ‘This one will wash; that one will iron.”

        Sometimes a deictic, particularly iyon is used in contexts in which English would normally use a
personal pronoun: e.g.,                                        si Linda.                     Maganda

                 ‘I saw                 Ben.                                 He’s           handsome.’
                                        the movie.                             It’s         interesting.’Tagalog too may use a personal pronoun in such cases, provided that the referent is human. Thus:                 Nakita ko si Linda. Maganda siya.","[100, 101, 102, 103]"
"There are, however, a few cases of obligatory number agrcement — as well as of obligatory absence of
number agreement — which are discussed below.
     Plurality in Tagalog is expressed through a variety of grammatical devices. In the case of personal
Pronouns and certain personal-noun phrases, it is expressed by distinctive plural forms: in that of
interrogative words and certain adjectives, by duplication. In other cases specific pluralizing affixes are
used. Elsewhere its most common expression involves the word mga, which adds the meaning of plurality to
the sentence element that follows it.
       The plural forms of personal pronouns are presented in §3.3; those of interrogative words, in §7.7.
Plural noun and verb affixes are presented in § §3.9 and 5.14 respectively; the pluralization of adjectives, in
§4.11. The present section deals first with the use of ga as a pluralizer of unmarked nouns, deictic
pronouns, and personal nouns, then with the pluralization of personal-noun markers.
      Mga is a conventional spelling for phonemic /manah/. This word, which is a PROCLITIC (i.c., does
not occur phrase finally), has two different meanings — approximative and plural — according to the type
of construction in which it occurs. Sfga is approximative when it occurs with a cardinal number or witha
time   expression.       [n its approximative           meaning    siga         translates       English ‘approximately’,     ‘about’, or
‘around’:     miga sainpu    ‘approximately       ten’; mga       ala ura        ‘about      one    o'clock’; sa mga buwan ng Encro
‘around the month of January’. (The approximative use of sga is discussed in § §4.4 and 6.8.) In all other
cases niga adds a plural meaning to the sentence clement that follows it.
       Mga occurs in its plural meaning with unmarked nouns, deictic pronouns, and personal nouns. (Plural
niga also occurs with adjectives — cf. §4.11 — and with nominalized verbals and adjective phrases — cf.
 §3.24.) Normally, it immediately precedes what it pluralizes:
                     mga librong para sa bata                                       ‘books for the child/children’
                     librong para sa mga bata                                       ‘a book/books for the children’

      (When mga is used to pluralize a modification construction in which the modifier precedes the
head — cf. §3.11 — mga may precede either the entire construction or the head. Thus:                   mga para sa batang libro
                                                              “books for the child.’)
                   para sa batang mga libro       In the case of unmarked nouns, Tagalog makes a distinction between pluralizable and unpluralizable
nouns that is like a distinction made in English. Some English nouns, e.g., table and party, have distinct
plural forms, while others — ¢.g., furniture and fun — normally do not. Similarly in Tagalog there are some
nouns that occur freely with »nga and others that normally do not. The two classes of nouns may be called
COUNT and MASS nouns respectively, following the usage of English grammarians.
       In gencral, Tagalog count nouns correspond             to English count nouns, and refer to items that are
perceived as discrete units: e.g.. bahay ‘house’. baro ‘dress’, bata ‘child’. Similarly, Tagalog mass nouns
generally correspond to English mass nouns, and refer to items that are not normally perceived as discrete
units: e.g., alikabok ‘dust’, asin ‘salt’, aso ‘smoke’. In some cases, however, the Tagalog
translation-equivalent of an English mass noun is a pluralized count noun: mga balita ‘news’, mga
kasangkapan ‘furniture’, mga maleta ‘baggage (bags)’. (Some speakers occasionally use mga with a mass
noun   (1) to express the idea of several masses:      e.g., wga alikabok ‘heaps of dust’ or (2) with the implied
deletion of a count noun: ¢.g., sga tubig, short for mga baso ng tubis ‘glasses of water’.
       When a deictic pronoun is pluralized by mga, the ang form of the deictic is used in all cases, and the
function of the deictic in the sentence is indicated by a marker (ang, ng, or sa) before the mga, rather than
by a change in the form of the deictic itself. Thus:       Silya ito                                        but                Silya ang mga ito
       ‘This is a chair.”                                                  ‘These are chairs.”","[121, 122]"

§ 6.9.     Locative adverbs.
         Locative adverbs are sa phrases. They represent the place where the action expressed in a sentence
occurs, or where the condition expressed in it prevails. The sa phrases that commonly occur as locative
adverbs include the following: sa plus an unmarked noun: kina plus a personal noun;sa plus the sa form of
a plural personal pronoun, the sa form of a deictic pronoun. Some examples are:                                                               sa iskwela.

                 Diyanitor                  siya
                                                               sa kanila.

                       eats
                                                     at Ben’s place.”
                 ‘He   is a janitor
                                                     at their place.’
                       has a job
                                                     there.’A locative adverb consisting of sa plus an unmarked noun js usually translated by an English ‘at,’ ‘in,’ or
‘on’ phrase; a locative adverb consisting of kina plus a personal noun is usually translated by ‘at             ’s
(place)’; a locative adverb consisting of sa plus the sa form of a plural personal pronoun is usually translated
by a phrase of the shape ‘at our/your/their place’; the sa form of a deictic pronoun used as a locative adverb
is usually translated by ‘here’ (in the case of dine and dito) or ‘there’ (in the case of diyan and doont). (Sa
phrases of the shapeXay plus a personal noun, or of the shape sa plus a singular personal pronoun rarely
occur as locative adverbs.)
      In a sentence with a verbal predicate, a sa phrase is sometimes ambiguously interpretable as a locative
adverb or as a directional complement. The sentence Suenulat siya sa mesa is an example of this kind of
ambiguity:    it may be interpreted as meaning ‘He wrote at the table,’ in which case sa mesa is interpreted as
a locative adverb, or it may mean         ‘He wrote (directly) on the table (itself), in which case sa mesa is
interpreted as a directional complement. (It may be noted that Sumudlat siya sa mesa has two different
goal—focus counterparts, each of which is unambiguous: Pinagsulatan niya ang mesa ‘He wrote at the table’
and Sinulatan niya ang mesa ‘He wrote (directly) on the table (itself).” The first of these goal—focus
constructions involves the locative—focus counterpart of sumulat (cf. $5.9 for a treatment of locative
focus), while the second involves its directional—focus counterpart.)
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                                  451       There are also cases in which a sa phrase may be ambiguously interpreted either as a Jocative adverb
or as a locative adjective phrase (cf. §4.19) modifying a noun. The sentence Mabait ang batasa iskwela is an
example of this kind of ambiguity: it may mean ‘The child is well-behaved at school,’ in which case sa
iskwela is interpreted as a locative adverb, or it may mean ‘The child (who is) at school is well—behaved,’ in
which case sa iskwela is interpreted as a locative adjective phrase modifying bara. (In the latter
interpretation, bata sa iskwela represents an optional abbreviation of batang nasa iskwela ‘child (who is) at
school’ — cf. §3.14.)
       Like the nasa of a locative adjective phrase, the sa of a locative adverb may be followed by a
positional phrase: a phrase consisting of a positional noun plus a mg phrase. (cf. §3.14 for a listing of
positional nouns.) A locative adverb that includes a positional phrase has the same English equivalent(s) as
the corresponding locative adjective phrase. Some examples are:
                                            harap
                                            Jabas
                Nakita ko siya sa                         ng teatro.
                                            likod

                ‘I saw him                                the theatre.”

                                            next to       A locative adverb in which sa is followed by may plus an unmarked noun, positional phrase, ctc,
expresses approximate location: e.g.,                Nakita ko sila sa may (harap ng) teatro.
                ‘I saw them in the vicinity of (the front of) the theater.”","[561, 562]"
"Some examples of basic sentences with marked nominals in predicate position are:                 Siya ang Amerikano.           *He’s the American.’
                 yan ang bahay.                ‘That's the house.”
                 Si Juan ang bunso.            ‘Juan’s the youngest child.’(Note that in the examples the marked-nominal predicate is translated by a subject in English. More precise
but more awkward English equivalents might be ‘The American is he’, etc. In any case, the Tagalog
sentences suggest contexts in which the predicates represent relatively new information — cf. §2.2).
        All nominals other than personal and deictic pronouns and personal nouns are UNMARKED NOUNS.
The function in a sentence of an unmarked noun is never explicitly indicated by the form of the noun
itself, and is not always explicitly indicated by a preceding marker. Unmarked nouns do occur in many
constructions after function-indicating markers (e.g., after the marker ang in topic position — cf. §2.16),
but unlike personal nouns, unmarked nouns also occur in constructions without markers. One of these
constructions is the nominal predicate.
     An unmarked noun in predicate position usually expresses one of two kinds of gencral meanings: ‘a
member of the class      ” or ‘the class      *, These two kinds of meanings may be called INDEFINITE
and GENERIC respectively. In English, these meanings are normally expressed by the choice of the article
that precedes a noun or by the absence of an article before the noun: the articles a/an, and some are the
usual signs of the indefinite; the absence of an article is a frequent sign of the generic. Note the English
translations of the Tagalog unmarked-noun predicates in the following examples:                 Isda ang bakalaw.                                    ‘The cod is a fish.’
                 Isda ang pagkain niya.                               ‘His meal was some fish.*
                 Isda ang paborito niya.                              ‘His favorite is fish.”",[74]
"       Of the two occurring possessive modification           constructions   that involve sa forms of personal
pronouns, the one in which the pronoun precedes the linker (¢.g., aking lapis) is very much more common
than the one in which the pronoun follows the linker (e.g., lapis na sa akin). The construction in which the
pronoun precedes the linker is, in fact, the only commonly used sa-possessive modification construction.
When   the possessor   is expressed by something other than a pronoun, there is a strong preference for the
ng-possessive construction, to be presented later in this section.
       The third type of possessive modification construction to be dealt with has the following structure:                Head (Possessor)                  Linker               Modifier (Thing Possessed)
                Noun                              na/-ng                Adjective + ang + Nouneg.,            batang bago ang lapis
                ‘child with the new pencil’
136                                                                                               CHAPTER 3This construction differs from the two previously discussed in several ways: it does not allow alternative
word order, and its head and modifier are not directly referable to the topic and predicate of an underlying
constituent sentence. From the point of view of meaning, however, the construction is similar to a
construction with a modifying may phrase that includes within it a modifying adjective: e.g.,                batang may bagong lapis
                ‘child with a new pencil’But, while the construction with may generally expresses the thing possessed as indefinite (note the
translation with ‘a’ rather than ‘the’), the construction under discussion always expresses the thing
possessed as definite.
       Note that the modifier in this construction has the shape of an ordinary equational
sentence — adjective + ang + noun. Further examples of the construction are:
                 bulaklak na mahaba ang tangkay
                 ‘flower with the long stem’                 babaeng berde ang baro
                 ‘woman with the green dress’                 doktor na malaki ang bahay
                 ‘doctor with the big house’
        The fourth type of possessive modification construction to be dealt with has the shape:                 Head (Thing Possessed)              Modifier (Possessor)
                 Noun                                ng PhraseC.g.,            lapis ng bata
                 the
                           ‘child’s pencil’
                 a(As in other cases, ng phrase is to be understood as a cover term for: ng plus an unmarked noun; ni or nina
plus a personal noun; the ng form of a personal or deictic pronoun.)
       This construction differs from the three previously presented possessive modification constructions in
that it does not include the linker na/-ng, and differs from the first two in that its components are not
directly referable to an underlying constituent sentence, and in the general nonreversibility of its
components. (The ng form of a personal pronoun may, however, in certain cases precede a noun expressing
the thing possessed; see below.)
      The possessive-ng-phrase construction is the most common Tagalog translation equivalent of English
possessive modification constructions involving the possessive suffix-’s, or involving ‘of: ang buntot ng aso
‘the dog’s tail’, ‘the tail of the dog’. Only when the possessor is a pronoun (expressed in English by my,
your, etc.) is the sa-possessive construction equally common:                fekine lapis
                 lapis ko
                 ‘my pencil’        A possessive ng phrase never begins the construction in which it occurs. When the possessor is
expressed by the ng form of a personal pronoun, however, and a modifying adjective precedes the word
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                               137 that represents the thing possessed, the pronoun may follow the adjective and precede the noun. Thus, an
 alternative to:
                    maliit na anak ko
                    ‘my little child.’there is also:                   maliit kong anak.","[145, 146, 147]"
"In the example, the resultant sentence has the same basic structure as the matrix sentence — subject: ‘the
book’; predicate:        ‘is a novel’ — but ‘book’ has been expanded by a phrase, ‘on the table’, taken from the
constituent sentence.
      The     above   example               illustrates one of the most important classes of embedded
constructions: MODIFICATION                 CONSTRUCTIONS. Modification constructions are distinguished from
certain other embedded constructions by the retention within the resultant sentence of all the elements of
the underlying matrix sentence. Some types of embedded constructions — for example, the Tagalog
nominal clause constructions (cf. §3.28)— involve the replacement of part of the matrix sentence by
elements taken from the constituent sentence. But in a modification construction the matrix sentence is
retained intact, and elements taken from the constituent sentence are merely added to it, serving to expand
a given part of the matrix sentence (e.g., ‘book’ in the above English example.)
       Strictly speaking, the term MODIFICATION CONSTRUCTION applies to that part of the resultant
sentence that consists of the element of the matrix sentence that has been expanded and the elements
(from the constituent sentence) by means of which it has been expanded. The modification construction in
‘The book on the table is a novel’ is thus ‘book on the table’. A modification construction consists of two
parts:     a part common       to the matrix sentence and the constituent sentence (hereafter, the HEAD), and a
part taken from the constituent sentence (hereafter, the MODIFIER). The two parts of ‘book on the table’
are: head, ‘book’; modifier, ‘on the table’.
      Tagalog shows a great diversity of modification constructions from the point of view of the types of
heads and modifiers that occur. But in one important respect almost all Tagalog modification constructions
are      alike.   This   is   that —with     the     exception    of certain   constructions   presented   in   §§3.19   and
3.20 ~ modifiers always correspond to the PREDICATE of the constituent sentence, while heads always
correspond to the TOPIC of the constituent sentence. In other words, the relation modifier-head in the
resultant sentence corresponds to the relation predicate-topic in the constituent sentence. To illustrate:          Matrix sentence:                          Nobela ang libro.
                                                    ‘The book is a novel.’          Constituent sentence:                     Nasa mesa ang libro.
                                                    ‘The book is on the table.’          Resultant sentence:                       Nobela ang librong nasa mesa.
                                                    ‘The book on the table is a novel.’The modification construction in the resultant sentence is librong nasa mesa. It includes the modifier nasa
mesa and the head libro. (The -ng after libro will be discussed below.) Note that in the constituent sentence
nasa mesa is the predicate while libro is in topic position. This same proportion — modifier is to head (in
the resultant sentence) as predicate is to topic (in the constituent sentence) — obtains in almost all Tagalog
modification constructions.
       In English the relation predicate-subject is frequently reflected in the relation modificr-head. But this
relationship in English is less consistent than the Tagalog proportion just presented. Thus the head ‘book’ in
the modification construction ‘book | read’ corresponds to the object of the constituent sentence — ‘I read
118                                                                                                   CHAPTER 3the book’ — rather than the subject, while the modifier ‘I read’ corresponds to the subject and a part of the
predicate. In the Tagalog modification construction librong binasa ko ‘book I read’, on the other hand, the
head libro and the modifier binaso ko correspond, as is usually the case, to the topic and predicate
respectively of the constituent sentence: Binasa ko ang libro ‘tread the book’.
      There is a second respect in which — again with certain exceptions discussed in § §3.19 and 3.20 — all
Tagalog modification constructions are alike. This is in their use of the device of LINKING. (As was noted
in §3.8, linking is the connecting of two sentence elements by means of a third, called a LINKER, which
has as its sole function the indication of a relation between the two elements it connects.) The clements of
Tagalog modification constructions are in the great majority of cases connected by the linker na/-ng, one of
the two major linkers of Tagalog. (The characteristics of the other major linker, the linker -ng, are presented
in §3.8.)
       The linker na/-ng has two different forms. The form that occurs in any given case is determined by
the final consonant of the independent form of the element that precedes the linker. If this final consonant
is /h/, {’'/, or /n/, the consonant is replaced by /n/, which is represented in conventional writing by -ng at the
end of a word. For example:        mabuti /mabu:tih/ ‘good’+ linker na/-ng + mabuting /mabu:tin/
        mayumi /mayu:mi / ‘modest’ + linker na/-ng - mayuming /mayu:min/
        mayaman /maya:man/ ‘rich’+ linker na/-ng - mayamang /maya:man/as in
                 mabuting                                                   good
                 mayuming              tao               ‘a                 modest                person’
                 mayamang                                                   richIf the final consonant is not /h/, /*/, or /n/, it is not replaced. Instead, it is followed by /na/, which is
represented in conventional spelling as a separate word, na. Thus:        masipag /masi:pag/ ‘diligent’ + linker na/-ng — masipag na /masi:pag na/
        magalang /maga:lan/ ‘courteous’ + linker na/-ng -> magalang na /maga:lan na/
        matakaw /mata:kaw/ ‘greedy’ + linker na/-mg > matakaw na /mata:kaw na/as in
                Masipag                                                     diligent
                 magalang             na tao             ‘a                 courteous             person’
                 matakaw                                                    greedy(The /na/ form of the linker na/-ng also occurs after a pausc, whatever may be the final consonant of the
word that precedes the pause — cf. §3.18.) (Some speakers occasionally, and others regularly, omit the /na/
form of the linker ma/-ng immediately after one of the enclitic particles daw, la(majng, and tuloy — cf.
§ §6.4 and 6.5. Thus the following sentence is acceptable with or without na:                 Masipag daw (na) tao ang kailangan nila.
                 ‘They say that what they necd is a diligent person."")        English has no device used in modification constructions that corresponds very closely to the Tagalog
linker na-/-ng. The most important grammatical device for expressing modification in English is word
order: one-word modifiers usually precede, and phrasal modifiers usually follow, the head: ‘new book’
versus ‘book on the table’. In Tagalog modification constructions, on the other hand, word order is
relatively free. Thus ‘new book’ may be either bagong libro or librong bago, and ‘book on the table’ cither
nasa mesang libro or librong nasa mesa. Certain Tagalog modification constructions, however, do show

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                               119      The modification constructions that have been used by way of example thus far have all been of quite
simple structure, with the modifier corresponding to the predicate of a basic sentence, and the head to the
topic of a basic sentence; such constructions may be called SIMPLE MODIFICATION CONSTRUCTIONS.
Both the modifier and the head may, however, be of more complex structure. Consider, for example, the
sentence:
               Nobela ang librong nasa mesang mababa.
               ‘The book on the low table is a novel.’Librong nasa mesang inababa ‘book on the low table’ is a modification construction. consisting of the head
libro, a linker, and the modifier nasa mesang mababa. But the latter itself includes a modification
construction, mesang mababa ‘low table’, which consists of the head mesa, a linker, and the modifier
mababa. Similarly, the head of a modification construction may itself include a modification construction:               Nobela ang bagong librong nasa mesa.
               ‘The new book on the table is a novel.’Here, bagong libro ‘new book’, which is the head of bagong librong nasa mesa, includes the modifier bago
and the head dibro. Modification constructions like these, in which the head and/or the modifier includes a
modification construction, may be called COMPLEX         MODIFICATION      CONSTRUCTIONS.
      In the sections that follow, simple modification constructions are dealt with first. Since the head of a
simple modification construction is, by definition, a noun or a pronoun (corresponding to the topic of a
basic sentence), the various simple constructions may be classified and discussed on the basis of the kinds of
modifiers involved. Simple modification constructions headed by personal pronouns and personal nouns,
however, have certain peculiarities that warrant separate discussion. In the sections that follow, the simple
modification constructions of Tagalog are presented in the following order: noun head with noun modifier
in §3.12; noun head with one-word-adjective modifier in §3.13; noun head with phrase modifier in §3.14;
modification of personal pronouns in §3.15; modification of personal nouns in §3.16. (For examples of
modification constructions with nominalized adjectivals and verbals as heads, cf. §3.24.) Complex
modification constructions are presented in §3.17.
      Like English, Tagalog distinguishes between        modification   constructions involving RESTRICTIVE
modifiers and those involving NONRESTRICTIVE modifiers. A restrictive modifier is one that limits the
reference of the head with which it occurs. A nonrestrictive modifier is one that merely gives information
about the head. Some English examples may clarify the distinction. Compare:               a. ‘The students who worked hard passed.”
               b. ‘The students, who worked hard, passed.”","[127, 128, 129]"

      By the MANNER OF ARTICULATION is meant the way in which the air escapes. The consonants of
Tagalog and English may be divided into seven classes on the basis of manner of articulation. The labels
given to six of these classes are listed immediately below; each label is followed by a brief statement of how
the air escapes in the given case.
       a.     STOP (the air passage is completely blocked)
       b.    NASAL      (the air, completely blocked   from escape through the mouth, escapes through the
             nose)
       ¢.    FRICATIVE (the air escapes through a relatively narrow passage between an articulator and a
             point of articulation)
       d.    AFFRICATE (first the air passage is completely blocked; then the block is rather slowly
             released, and the air escapes through a relatively narrow passage between an articulator and a
             point of articulation)
       e.    LATERAL      (the air escapes over and around the sides of the tongue, passage over the center of
             the tongue being blocked)
       f.    TRILL (the air is intermittently blocked and allowed to escape, through a series of rapid
             tongue-movements; a single such movement is called a TAP)
       The seventh class includes sounds which, from the point of view of manner of articulation, are similar
to vowels, but which, unlike the vowels themselves, are characterized by movement            from one vocalic
tongue position to another. This seventh class is:
       g.    GLIDE.
     VOICE as noted above, is the characteristic noise produced by the vibration of the vocal cords. A
sound during which voice is present is called VOICED; a sound during which voice is absent is called
VOICELESS.
PRONUNCIATION                                                                                                     5§1.3. Phonemes.
      Every language makes use of a considerable variety of speech sounds. Not all of the differences among
the sounds that occur in a language, however, are used to distinguish words of the language from one
another. In English, for example, the initial consonant sounds of the words goose and geese are not
identical in their articulation. The point of articulation of the first is the velum; that of the second, the hard
palate. But the difference in articulation between these sounds never constitutes the only difference
between two English words. In the other hand, the difference between the initial consonant sounds of glass
and class (the first is voiced, the second voiceless) can, and often does, constitute the only difference
between two English words.
       From the point of view of their function in distinguishing the words of a language from one another,
the speech sounds of a language arrange themselves into a system of contrasting classes. These contrasting
classes are called the PHONEMES of the language. Two speech sounds of a language belong to the same
phoneme if, first, they cannot constitute the only difference between two words, and, second, they have a
certain degree of articulatory similarity to one another. Both requirements are met by the initial sounds of
goose and geese (which are similar in being voiced stops), and the two sounds thus belong to a single English
phoneme. Two speech sounds of a language belong to different phonemes whenever the difference between
them may constitute the only difference between two words. Thus the initial consonant sounds of glass and
class belong to two different English phonemes.
      A speech sound that is a member of a phoneme is known as an ALLOPHONE               of that phoneme. Thus
the initial sounds of gouse and geese are said to be allophones of the same phoneme.","[13, 14]"
"       An abbreviated alternative to a head-linker-modifier construction may occur whenever the modifier is
a reservational, partisanship or purpose phrase of the shape para + sa + noun (cf. §4.20) or a locative phrase
of the shape na + sa + noun (cf. §4.19). In the case of a para-sa-phrase modifier, the abbreviation consists in
the deletion of the linker, so that the resultant constructions has the shape: head + para + sa + noun. If, for
example, the linker is deleted from regalong para sa titser ‘present for the teacher’, what remains is regalo
para sa titser, which has exactly the same meaning. In the case of a locative-phrase modifier, the
abbreviation consists in the deletion of both the linker and the na of the locative phrase, so that the
resultant construction has the shape: head + sa + noun. If, for example, the linker and the na are deleted
from librong nasa mesa ‘book on the table’, what remains is libro sa mesa which has exactly the same
meaning. Some further examples of abbreviated para-sa-phrase-modifier and locative-modifier constructions
are given below. In each case the full form of the construction, which includes the linker (and, in the case
of locative modifiers, the na of the locative phrase), is given above the abbreviated form:
                                   titser na para sa ikalawang mt
               Sino ang
                                  titser para sa ikalawang grado?
               ‘Who is the teacher for the second grade?’                                   telegramang para sa iyo.
               May
                                   telegrama para sa iyo.
               ‘There’s a telegram for you.”                                   bahay na nasa |
               Malaki ang
                                 bahay sa kanto.

                                          silya sa salas.
               ‘He took the chair (that was) in the living room.’
(The last of the above examples is actually ambiguous in its abbreviated form, since sa salas may be
interpreted not only as a locative modifier of silya, but also as a locative adverb placed in sentence-final
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                            125position — cf. §6.9. With the latter interpretation, the sentence Kinuha niya ang silya sa salas would have
the meaning ‘He took the chair from the living room’. This type of ambiguity is quite common when the
abbreviated locative-modifier construction is used.)
§3.15.     Modification of personal pronouns.
       Modification constructions headed by personal pronouns are considerably more restricted, both in
their internal structure and in the contexts in which they occur, than are modification constructions headed
by nouns. The order of elements within a modification construction headed by a personal pronoun is
always head (pronoun) + linker + modifier. Thus:                                  mga sundalo                                 soldiers’
                                  tatlo                                       three’
                                  mga pagod                                   tired ones’
               kaming                                             “we
                                 mahihirap                                    poor ones’
                                  nasa hukbo                                  in the army’
                                  pinili niya                                 whom he chose’but not: *nga sundalong kami, etc.
       In the case of singular pronouns, only the ang forms (cf. §3.3) may occur as heads of modification
constructions, and then only in predicate position. Thus:               Ikaw na Pilipino ang kailangan ng heneral.
               ‘What the general needs is you, a Filipino.’but not:
               *Kailangan kang Pilipino ng heneral.
These restrictions do not apply to plural pronouns. Ang, ng, and sa plural pronouns may all head
modification constructions, and such modification constructions may occur in all the same contexts as the
unmodified pronouns. Thus:               Kailangan kayong mga Pilipino ng heneral.
               ‘The general need you Filipinos.’               Mahal ninyong mga Pilipino ang bayan ninyo.
               ‘Your country is dear to you Filipinos.’               Para sa inyong mga Pilipino ang paanyayang ito.
               ‘This invitation is for your Filipinos.’       For some speakers, any noun or pluralizable one-word adjective modifying a plural pronoun must be
explicitly pluralized (cf. §§3.9 and 4.11). For other speakers explicit pluralization in such cases is not
obligatory, but merely preferred. There is thus a certain amount of disagreement about the acceptability of
constructions such as kayong Pilipino and kaming mahirap. All speakers prefer kayong nga Pilipino and
kaming (mga) mahihirap, and some reject the constructions with nonpluralized modifiers altogether.
       Modification constructions headed by the ag ang sa third-person-plural pronouns nila and Kanila are
relatively rare except where the modifier is a cardinal number. Thus constructions like nilang/kanilang mga
Pilipino ‘(of/to) them who are Filipinos’ are uncommon, but constructions like nilang/kanilang dalawa
‘(of/to) the two of them’ are of frequent occurrence.
       In many cases, sentences that may be interpreted as involving modification constructions headed by
ng Of sa pronouns are susceptible to another structural interpretation as well. Thus the sentence:               Ilan ang pipiliin naming mga opisyal?
126                                                                                                      CHAPTER 3may   mean     either   ‘How     many   will   we officers choose?’ (in which         case naming mga opisyal is a
pronoun-headed modification construction) or ‘How many officers will we choose?’ (in which case pipiliin
naming mga opisyal is a modification construction headed by mga opisyal: literally, ‘(the)
will-be-chosen-by-us officers’). Similarly the sentence:                 Para sa inyong mga ina ang paanyayang ito.may mean either ‘This invitation is for you mothers’ (in which case inyong mga ina is a pronoun-headed
modification construction) or ‘This invitation is for your mothers (in which case inyong niga ina is a
possessive    modification     construction — cf.   §3.19). In most such cases of ambiguity, native speakers of
Tagalog tend to interpret the sentences as not involving pronoun-headed modification constructions unless
the context makes this interpretation perfectly clear.","[134, 135, 136]"
"§3.12. Modification constructions: noun head with noun modifier.
     In this and the following two sections, NOUN is used as a cover term for unmarked nouns and deictic
pronouns. (Note that the term noun, as used in these sections, does not include personal pronouns or
personal nouns.)
120                                                                                                     CHAPTER 3      Any   equational    sentence   with    a noun   predicate    and a noun topic may serve as the constituent
sentence of a modification construction of the shape noun + linker (na/-ng) + noun. Thus corresponding to
sentences such as Repolyo ang gulay ‘The vegetable (dish) is (made from) cabbage’ and Besbol ang laro ‘The
game is baseball’, there are modification constructions such as gulay na repolyo ‘vegetable dish made from
cabbage’ and darong besbol “baseball game’.
     The preferred ordering of nouns within a simple modification construction is: head-linker-modifier.
That is, the first noun of the construction generally corresponds to the noun in topic position in the
constituent sentence, the second to the noun in predicate position. In most cases, therefore, the first noun
represents older information or a more general semantic category, while the second noun represents newer,
more explicit, or contrastive information. Thus, to convey in a modification construction the relation
expressed in the sentence Kalan ang laruan ‘The toy is a stove’, the order laruan-linker-kalan (laruang kalan
‘toy stove’) is preferred. Only when there is a wish to contrast ‘toy stove’ with, for example, ‘real stove’, is
the order kalan-linker-laruan (Kalang laruan ‘toy stove’ or ‘stove that’s a toy’) preferred; and here the
underlying sentence would be Lanuan ang Kalan ‘The stove is a toy’.
       The modifying and/or contrastive function of the second noun in a modification construction is also
evident when one of the nouns is a deictic. In a sentence like Mahal ang danit na ito ‘This dress is
expensive’, the deictic ito is a modifier that makes the referent of the noun damir explicit. Expressed in
terms of matrix, constituent, and resultant sentences, the relationships within Mahal ang damit na ito are as
follows:                Matrix sentence:                            Mahal ang damit.
                                                            ‘The dress is expensive.""
                                                                                          —_——    ee
                Constituent sentence:                        Ito ang damit.
                                                             ‘This is the dress.”","[129, 130]"
"§3.2.     Marked nouns.
        As was stated in §2.4,a MARKED NOUN                         is so called because its sentence function is always marked,
either by its own form or by the form of a preceding marker. Every marked noun occurs in three different
forms or with three different markers, each form or marker indicating a particular set of sentence functions.
The three forms (of the marked noun itself or of the preceding marker) are called: the ang form, the ng
form, and the sa form. Ang forms (or nouns preceded by ang-form markers) occur as predicates or topics:
ng forms (or nouns preceded by ng-form markers) occur as verb complements or possessive modifiers (sce
§3.19), and in general, in all other contexts in which ng-plus-unmarked-noun phrases may occur:sa forms
(or nouns preceded by sa-form markers) occur as verb complements, as possessive predicates or modifiers
(cf. § §4.22 and 3.19), and, in general, in all other contexts in which sa-plus-unmarked-noun phrases may
occur.

14                                                                                                                           CHAPTER 2§2.11. Verbal complements in basic sentences.
         The three kinds of verbal complements introduced in §2.10 are discussed below in the following
order:    (1) the    actor        complement;        (2) the     object    complement;     (3) the     directional     complement.   The
discussion covers only those forms of the complements that occur in basic sentences. (Those forms of the
complements that do not occur in basic sentences      — viz., the sa-pronoun actor complement and the
sa-phrase object complement — are presented in §5.25.)
       (1). The actor complement.     An actor complement may occur with any object-focus or
directional-focus verb, whether the verb is single-object or double-object. In basic sentences, the actor
complement is expressed by a ng PHRASE. The term ng phrase designates the following structures: the
marker ng (/nax/) plus an unmarked noun; the marker ni plus a personal noun, the ag form of a personal or
deictic pronoun. (A ng form is so labeled because it occurs in some of the same contexts‘as structures that
include ag.) The ng forms of the personal pronouns are:         ko                  a                                     namin           ‘Land others/we’
         nita                ‘you and I/we’                        natin           ‘you and I (and others)/we’
         mo                  ‘you’                                 ninyo           ‘you (and others)’
         niya                    ‘he/she’                          nila            ‘he and others/she and others/they’The ng forms of the deictic pronouns are:
                    nire                    ‘this’                              niyan                         “that?
                    nito                    ‘this’                              niyon/noon                    ‘that’
Some examples of basic sentences with actor complements are:                                                      ng modista

       An actor complement that consists of ug plus an unmarked noun is sometimes translated in English
by a definite noun phrase (i.e., a phrase introduced by ‘the’), sometimes by an indefinite noun phrase (i.e.,
a phrase introduced by ‘a/an* or ‘some’). This:               Ginising ng ingay ang bata.may mican cither ‘A noise awakened the child’ or ‘The noise awakened the child’. (In most cases, however, a
ng-plus-unmarked-noun actor complement in itself suggests a meaning of definiteness, and indefiniteness is
indicated unambiguously only by the insertion of isa ‘one/a’ plus the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11) before the
noun. Thus:               Ginawa ng modista ang baro.
               ‘The dressmaker made the dress.”but:               Ginawa ng isang modista ang baro.
               *A dressmaker made the dress.”)       Marked-noun actor complements are necessarily definite, because of the definite meanings of marked
nouns themselves.
      (2). The object complement. An object complement may occur with an actor-focus object verb or
double-object verb or with a directional-focus double-object verb. In basic sentences, the object
complement is expressed by ang phrase, which must be either ng plus an unmarked noun or the ng form of
a deictic pronoun. (Personal pronouns and personal nouns do not occur as object complements in basic
sentences. Their occurrence as object complements in certain derived sentences is discussed in §5.25.)
       Some examples of basic sentences with object complements are:
                                     ng estudyante
               Pumili                                                       ang titser.

               ‘The teacher chose
                                             some of that.’                                     ng pagkain
               Nagdala                                                      sa handaan ang Nanay.

and is translated by an English noun phrase that includes an indefinite article. The ng form of a deictic
pronoun also has, as object complement, an indefinite meaning: e.g., ‘some of this/that’.
       (3). The directional complement. A directional complement may occur with an actor-focus
directional verb or double-object verb, or with an object-focus double-object verb. The directional
complement     is expressed by a Sa PHRASE.       The term sa phrase designates the following structures:    the
marker sa plus an unmarked noun or plus the sa form of a personal pronoun; the marker kay plus a personal
noun; the sa form of a deictic pronoun. (A sa form is so labeled because it occurs in some of the same
contexts as structures that include sa.) The sa forms of the personal pronouns are:      akin             ‘me’                      amin              ‘me and others/us*
      kanita           ‘you and me/us’           atin              ‘you and me (and others)/us’
      iyo              ‘you’                     inyo              ‘you (and others)’
      kaniya           ‘him/her’                 kanila            ‘him and others/her and others/them*The sa forms of the deictic pronouns are:                dine               “this/here’                       divan              ‘that/there’

with cither a definite or indefinite noun phrase in English. (To express a meaning of indefiniteness
unambiguously within a sa complement, isa ‘one/a‘ plus the linker ma/-ng (cf. §3.11) is inserted before the
noun. Thus:               Bumalik sa isang gulsali ang bata.
               ‘The child returned to a building.’To express a meaning of definiteness unambiguously within a sa complement, the noun within the sa
complement is modified in some way (cf. §3.11, ff.). Thus:               Bumalik sa gusaling iyon ang bata.
               ‘The child retumed to that building.’)      Since the topic usually corresponds to a definite noun phrase in English and a directional complement
frequently does so, it is not always easy for an English translation to reveal the difference between an
actor-focus construction with a directional complement and a directional-focus construction with an actor
complement. For example, the Tagalog equivalent of ‘The child returned to the building’ may be either an
actor-focus construction with a directional complement:               Bumialik sa gusali ang bata.or a directional-focus construction with an actor complement:               Binalikan ng bata ang gusali.","[83, 84, 85, 86, 87]"
"      When the first of two potential coordinates is expressed by a personal pronoun and the second by a
nominal other than a personal pronoun, Tagalog in some cases allows, in others requires, the use of a

SPECIAL COORDINATE CONSTRUCTION in place of the coordinate construction with at. This special
coordinate construction consists of a plural personal pronoun followed by a ng phrase (ng plus an
unmarked noun, ni or nina plus a personal noun, or the ng form of a deictic). If the underlying pronoun is
singular, the pronoun in the resultant sentence is its plural counterpart. Thus from the underlying sentences
Nakita ko siya ‘| saw him’ and Nakita ko si Juan ‘| saw Juan’ is derived:                    Nakita ko sila ni Juan.
                    ‘I saw him and Juan.”","[125, 126]"
"In each sentence, niya follows hindi, which is the first word of the predicate. In sentence (1) the predicate
is sentence-initial; in sentence (2) it is clause-initial; in sentence (3) it follows the topic (and the inversion
marker ay). Regardless of where the predicate occurs, the wg pronoun that constitutes an immediate part of
the predicate follows its first word.
      A ng pronoun that occurs as part of a marked construction normally follows the first word, other
than the marker itself, within that construction. The marked construction may involve either a noun and a
ng pronoun used as a possessive modifier, or a verb and ang pronoun used as an actor complement. (Verbs
occur after markers in nominalized verbals — cf. §3.24.) Note, for example, the position of niya in the
following sentences.

        The word that an enclitic follows (either immediately or after one or more other enclitics) within a
given construction may be called the PRE-ENCLITIC WORD (hereafter, P). In sentences cited thus far, P
has in cach case been the first word of the construction of which the enclitic constitutes an immediate part.
There are, however, cases in which P is preceded by one or more other words. Any word that precedes P in
a given construction is a NON-PRE-ENCLITIC (hereafter, N). An inventory of common words, word
classes, and structures that function as N with respect to enclitic pronouns is given below. (The inventory
does not apply in all cases to enclitic particles, since certain sentence elements that function as N with
respect to enclitic pronouns may function as P with respect to the particles —cf. §6.6.) From this
inventory the position of P (with respect to pronouns) in any given construction may be determined, since
P is always the first word of the construction that is not N.
      The inventory is divided into two parts. Part I, labeled OBLIGATORY                           NON-PRE-ENCLITICS, lists
sentence clements that never function as P with respect to enclitic pronouns. Part Hl, labeled OPTIONAL
NON-PRE-ENCLITICS, lists sentence elements that may function either as N or as P with respect to enclitic
pronouns.

                   ‘The teacher bought a book from the store.’ §2.13. The topic.
       As was stated in §2.2, the topic is the second major component of a basic sentence. The topic of a
basic sentence is expressed by an ang PHRASE. Ang phrase is a cover term for the following structures: ang
plus an unmarked noun; si plus a personal name; the ang form of a personal or deictic pronoun. (An ang
form is so labeled because it occurs in some of the same contexts as structures that include ang.) The ang
forms of personal and deictic pronouns, which also occur as nominal predicates, have been presented in
§2.4. There is only one case in which the predicate and topic ang forms differ from one another. This is the
case of ‘you (singular)’, which is expressed by ikaw in predicate position, by ka in topic position (c.g.,
Matalino ka ‘You're intelligent’ versus /kaw and matalino ‘The intelligent one is you’).

     To summarize:

             Topic                      Topic                       Topic               Topic

      In basic sentences the topic commonly follows the entire predicate. If, however, the topic is the ang
form of a personal pronoun and the predicate is a phrase (e.g., an adjectival phrase or a
transitive-verb-plus-complement phrase), the pronoun usually must follow the first word of the predicate,
rather than the entire predicate. (More preciscly, the pronoun follows the first word other than a
NON-PRE-ENCLITIC. For a detailed discussion of the sentence positions occupied by personal pronouns,
cf. §3.29.) Thus the topic ako ‘I’ in the following sentence appears immediately after the predicate verb
and precedes the complement of the verb:               Bumili ako ng bigas.
               ‘I bought some rice.’Compare this sentence to:                                         ang babae.
               Bumili ng bigas           si Rosa.
                                         iyon.","[89, 90]"
"Nor is the same flexibility present in the case of sentences that include the ne form of a personal pronoun
used as an actor complement. Thus there is a grammatical sentence:
                   Nakita niya si Ben.
                   ‘He saw Ben.”but there is no:
                   *Nakita si Ben niya.
This difference in behavior between personal pronouns and nominals of other types reflects the fact that
the pronouns are, in certain of their uses, ENCLITICS (or ENCLITIC WORDS).
         An enclitic is a word that obligatorily occurs in a position after some other word or group of words.
In Tagalog, enclitics, with certain statable exceptions, follow the first word of the construction of which
they constitute an immediate part. (See below for an explanation of IMMEDIATE PART.) Note, for
example, the position of the enclitic pronoun siya in the following sentences:
                   (1)   Masaya siya ngayon.
                         ‘He is happy today.’                         (cf.   Masaya si Ben ngayon.
                                ‘Ben is happy today.’)                   (2)   Hindi siya masaya ngayon.
                         ‘He isn’t happy today.”                         (cf.   Hindi masaya si Ben ngayon.
                                ‘Ben isn’t happy today.)                   (3)   Bakit siya hindi masaya ngayon?
                         ‘Why isn’t he happy today?’                         (cf.   Bakit hindi masaya si Ben ngayon?
                                ‘Why isn’t Ben happy today?’)
184                                                                                                CHAPTER3
Siya — which is, in these examples, an immediate part of the entire sentence — occurs after the first word of
the sentence in cach case, whatever the grammatical function of this word. (In sentence (1), a basic
sentence, the first word is a predicate adjective; in sentence (2), the first word is a negator — cf. §7.13; in
sentence (3), the first word is an interrogative — cf. §7.10.) This behavior is notably different from that of
a non-enclitic nominal (such as si Ber).
       Tagalog has enclitic words of two types: enclitic personal pronouns and enclitic particles. The
enclitic personal pronouns are discussed in the present section, the enclitic particles in § §6.2 through 6.6.
       The sa forms of personal pronouns are never enclitic. The ang forms of personal pronouns (hereafter,
ang pronouns) are enclitic when they are used as topics, except that ang pronouns used as inverted topics
(cf. §7.2) are non-enclitic. The sg forms of personal pronouns (hereafter, ng pronouns) are enclitic both as
actor complements and as possessive modifiers (cf. §3.20), as in:               Hindi niya kaklase si Ben.
               *Ben isn’t his classmate.’               (cf.   Hindi kaklase ni Pedro si Ben.
                      *Ben isn’t Pedro's classmate.’)(The composite pronoun kita —cf. §3.3 —is also enclitic.) (Topic ang phrases other than personal
pronouns occasionally occur in typically enclitic positions. The placement of such a topic in enclitic
position is always optional. Optional enclitic behavior may be manifested by non-personal-pronoun topics
in, for example, sentences introduced by mayrvon, hindi, or wala (cf. §§4.22, 7.13, and 7.14), and in
sentences with modification constructions in predicate position. Examples are:               Mayroon ba ang batang lapis?
               “Does the child have a pencil?’
               (cf. Mayroon bang lapis ang bata?)               Hindi si Juan darating bukas.
               ‘Juan won’t be coming tomorrow.’
               (cf.   Hindi darating bukas si Juan.)               Wala itong takip.
               ‘This one doesn't have a cover.”
               (cf. Walang takip ito.)               Magaling ang aspirinang gamot.
               ‘Aspirin is an excellent medicine.’
               (cf. Magaling na gamot ang aspirina.)Optional enclitic behavior may also occasionally be manifested by non-personal-pronoun topics in
constructions of various other types.)
      When a sentence includes an ang pronoun and a ng pronoun both of which are enclitic to the same
word, the following rules of order obtain:       (1) the monosyllabic pronouns ka (ang form, second-person singular), ko (ng form, first-person
singular), and mo (ng form, second-person singular) always precede any other enclitic pronoun;
       (2) in other cases, an ang pronoun and a ng pronoun may occur in either order, but the order
ng-pronoun-plusag-pronoun is the more common, especially when the ng pronoun is niya (third-person
singular). Examples of the operation of these rules are:                                      niya.
               Nakita ka              namin.

        As Chart 2 shows, Tagalog has five vowel phonemes, symbolized /i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, and /u/. From the
point of view of tongue height, there are two high-vowel phonemes, /i/ and /u/, two mid-vowel phonemes,
fef and fo/, and one vowel phoneme with a range from mid to low, /a/. From the point of view of tongue
frontness, there are two front-vowel phonemes, /fi/ and /e/, one central-vowel phoneme, /a/, and two
back-vowel phonemes, /u/ and /o/. There is a correlation in Tagalog, as in English, between the tongue
frontness and the shape assumed by the lips in the articulation of the vowel. The front vowels of Tagalog
are characterized by spread lips, the central vowel by neutral lip position, and the back vowels by rounded
lips.
        Chart 3 shows the principal allophones of the Tagalog vowel phonemes, As in Chart 2, the range of
tongue positions of the phonemes is delimited by heavy lines. Broken           lines are used     to mark   the
approximate boundary between allophones of a single phoneme.
        As Chart 3 shows, cach of the Tagalog vowel phonemes has two principal allophones. The principal
allophones of the phoneme /fi/ are (i) (upper-high front) and [/] (lowcr-high front); the principal
allophones of /e/ are [e] (upper-mid front) and [¢] (lower-mid front); those of /a/ are [9] (with a range
from upper-mid central to upper-low central) and [a] (lower-low central); those of /o/, [o] (upper-mid
back) and [9] (lower-mid back); and those of /u/, [u) (upper-high back) and [vu] (lower-high back).
      Chart 4 shows certain English vowel phonemes and diphthongs to which the Tagalog vowels are
compared in subsequent sections. (A DIPHTHONG may be defined, for practical purposes, as a vowel
followed by a glide consonant in the same syllable.) The English vowels and diphthongs are arranged, once
more, according to tongue position. In the case of the diphthongs, the tongue position shown is that of the
initial vowel of the diphthong. The /y/ represents a glide upward and forward from the vowel position, the
/w/, a glide upward and back from the vowel position.

not shown in Chart 4. These include the upper-low-front vowel /ae/, as in ‘pat’ /paet/, which has no
Tagalog counterpart, and certain diphthongs that are discussed in connection with the Tagalog diphthongs
in §1,11,)
      The Tagalog vowels are presented in detail in §§1.6 through 1.10: /i/ in §1.6; /e/ in §1.7; /a/ in
§1.8: /o/ in §1.9; /uf in §1.10. The Tagalog diphthongs are presented in § 1.11.
      Before the individual vowel phonemes and diphthongs of Tagalog are discussed, a few general
observations may be made about the Tagalog vowel system as a whole. All Tagalog vowels show a
correlation between length and tenseness, long vowels tending to be tense, short vowels lax. (Long vowels
are marked in the phonemic transcriptions of this book by a raised dot following the vowel symbol: thus
fir] is long, /i/ short, as in Mnis /linis/ ‘cleanliness’.) Vowel length in Tagalog is phonemic: that is, there are
pairs of words that are distinguished from one another on the basis of vowel length alone (cf. §1.12
and — for a discussion of the relation of vowel length to stress — § 1.29).
      As in American English, nasalized vowels frequently occur in Tagalog before or after the nasal
consonants /m/, /n/, and /n/ (see §1.16). Thus the vowels in words like the following would frequently be
nasalized: Jamlam /lamlam/ ‘gloom’, bunton /bunton/ ‘heap’, hangang fhangan/ ‘until’, manganak
/mananak/ ‘give birth’. In other positions, Tagalog vowels are oral.
       The present five-phoneme Tagalog vowel system has developed historically from a three-phoneme
system, in which there was one front-vowel phoneme, /i/, one central-vowel: phoneme, /a/, and one
back-vowel phoneme, /u/. The change from the three-vowel to the five vowel system (with the addition of
the phonemes /e/ and /o/) very likely has been brought about through the incorporation into Tagalog of
many loan words from Spanish and English, by Tagalog speakers more or less familiar with these languages.
While there is no doubt that educated Manila Tagalog now has five vowel phonemes, there are perhaps other
Tagalog dialects that still lack a phonemic distinction between /i/ and /e/ and between /u/ and /o/. And
even in the case of the educated Manila dialect, there are still many instances of interchangeability between
the members of these pairs of phonemes, as is explained in the appropriate sections below.
§1.6. fi/.
      The phoneme /i/ has two principal allophones: [i] and [/]. The allophone [i], an upper-high-front
spread vowel, is similar to the English vowel that occurs as the first element of a diphthong in ‘be* /biy/ or
‘beat’ /biyt/. In English, this vowel is regularly followed by a forward and upward gliding movement of the
tongue (represented by /y/ in phonemic transcriptions of English). In Tagalog, on the other hand, there is
no /y/ glide regularly associated with [i].
       The allophone [/] , a lower-high-front spread vowel, is similar to the vowel of English ‘bit’ /b/t/.
       While the sounds [i] and (/] occur both in English and in Tagalog, the sounds play quite different
roles in the vowel systems of the two languages. In English the difference between the two sounds may be
used in distinguishing two words from one another (e.g., ‘beat’ and “bit’). In Tagalog the difference between
the sounds is never used in this way, and any word in which one of the sounds occurs may be pronounced
with the other as well, with no change of meaning.
PRONUNCIATION      Although [i] and [7] are interchangeable in Tagalog without any resultant change of meaning, one or
the other of the sounds is the more usual under certain specifiable conditions. A long /i/ is usually
represented by the [i] allophone. Thus the [i) allophone normally occurs in the following items:                biro                           {birro’/                               ‘joke’

the [i] allophone when the phrase-final word is being emphasized.
       Many words that have the phoneme /i/ in a word-final syllable allow the replacement of /i/ by /e/ if
the word is phrase-final. Most of the words that allow alternation between /i/ and /e/ in a phrase-final
syllable are words of native Tagalog origin. (Details and examples of such variation are presented in §1.7.)
Loan words from Spanish and, especially, from English, on the other hand, rarely if ever allow replacement
of ji} by /e/. The /i/'s in the following loan words, for example, are perfectly stable:                abril                          abril/                                 ‘April’

        The two principal allophones of the Tagalog phoneme           /e/ are   [e]   and      [e]: respectively, an
upper-mid-front spread vowel and a lower-mid-front spread vowel. The allophone [e] is similar to the
English vowel that occurs as the first element of a diphthong in ‘bay’ /bey/ or ‘bait’ /beyt/; the allophone
{e] is similar to the English vowel that occurs in ‘bet’ /bet/.
        In the Tagalog of some speakers, the two principal allophones of /e/ are in completely free alternation
with one another. (That is, the two allophones are used interchangeably, each occurring in all the same
contexts as the other.) Other speakers prefer one or the other of the allophones in some or all contexts,
but, since there is no context in which a majority of speakers reject either allophone, either [e] or [e] may
be used to represent the phoneme in all cases.
      Some illustrations of the phoneme /e/ are:                ate                             [’ateh}{                              ‘elder sister’

lif by fe/ if the word is phrase-final. Such alternation between fi/ and fe/ is extremely common in the case
of words of native Tagalog origin with short penultimate vowels; and in fact, the great majority of such
words allow the alternation. For some speakers the alternation in these words is entirely free, the two
phonemes being used interchangeably; for other speakers, cither /i/ or fe/ is normal, the other occurring
under certain conditions of style or in special contexts. At any rate, both fi/ and /e/ are very common in
the final syllable of words like the following, when the words are followed by a pause:               gabi                 {gabih/                  or                 /gabeh/            ‘night’
               itim                 fitim/                   or                 fitem/             *black*
               mabait               /maba’it/                or                 /maba’et/          *kind’      It should be noted that, when words like those just listed are not phrase-final, there is no alternation
between jij and /e/, only /i/ occurring under these circumstances. Thus:               gabi ba                                 fgabi bah/                              ‘night?’
               itim ba                                 Pitim bah/                              ‘black?’
               mabait ba                               /maba‘it bah/                           *kind?°      There is also a good deal of alternation between /i/ and /e/ in phrase-final syllables in words of native
Tagalog origin with long penultimate vowels. The alternation is particularly common in the case of syllables
ending in /h/. (Words that end in phonemic /h/ are written without a final consonant in conventional
orthography; see § § 1.17 and 1.30.) The following words illustrate this alternation.               gabi                 fgarbih/                 or                 /ga-beh/           ‘yam’
               lalaki               falakih/                 or                 flalakeh/          *man’
               sili                 {sivlih/                 or                 {sirleh/           ‘pepper’      One final case of alternation between /e/ and /i/ may be mentioned. This is the case of a short /e/ ina
word-final syllable which is not phrase-final. The /¢e/ in such cases may be replaced by /i/, as the following
examples show:               kape pa = /kape pah/                    or         /kapi pah/                ‘more coffee*
               Lunes na_=/luenes nahf                  or         flurnis nah{              ‘it’s Monday”
               sige na       {siege nah{               or         fsi-gi nah/               ‘OK’      Sporadic replacement of short /e/ by short /i/ in a non-word-final syllable may also occur, but in
general short /e/ in this position is quite stable. Thus the replacement of short /e/ by short /i/ in words like
the following would be highly unusual:               arkitektura                      Parkitektusrah/                             ‘architecture’
               eleksyon                         ‘eleksyon/                                  ‘election’
               eroplano                         feroplanoh/                                 ‘airplane’        In addition to the cases of alternation between /e/ and /i/ discussed in this section, there are also
certain cases in which a short /e/ is replaced by a long /i/ asa result of the length-shifting effect of certain
suffixes. These cases are discussed in §1.12.
        In spite of the many cases of alternation between /e/ and /i/, there is no doubt that the two are
distinct phonemes in Tagalog, since there are a number of pairs of words whose members differ from cach
other only in that one has /e/ while the other has /i/. Examples such pairs are:               benta         /be-ntah/          ‘sale’      binta           /di-ntah/          ‘Moro canoe’

               senyas        /se-nyas/          ‘sign’      sinyas          /sinyas/           *zinnias’
PRONUNCIATION                                                                                                         in        It may be noted that the phoneme /e/, except when it occurs as a replacement for /i/ in a phrase-final
syllable, is usually found in words borrowed into Tagalog from other languages. In native Tagalog words,
the sound most often occurs as a variant of the diphthong /ay/, and is discussed as such in §J.11.
        In the Tagalog of certain younger speakers, long /e/ also occurs as a free alternant of the sequence
fi'af. These speakers may,        for example, pronounce hindi ako            ‘not   I’ (normally, /hindi’ akoh/) as
fhinde‘kohj.
§1.8.    /a/.
       The two principal allophones of Tagalog /a/ are [a] and [2]. [a] , a lower-low-central neutral vowel, is
similar to the vowel that occurs in mid-Western American English ‘pot’ /pat/ or ‘part’ /part/. [2] coversa
range of tonguc-positions, from upper-low central to upper-mid central, and, like {a], is characterized by
neutral lip position. The range of tongue positions of Tagalog [9] includes that of the vowel of American
English ‘but’ /bat/ (lower-mid central), as well as that of the unstressed vowel of ‘sofa’ (upper-mid central),
and that of the vowel that occurs in a common British pronunciation of words like ‘but’ (upper-low
central). For practical purposes, the allophone may be considered identical with the vowel of American
‘but’.
       The allophones of Tagalog /a/ are distributed as follows. Long /a/ is always represented by the (a]
allophone. Thus the [a] allophone occurs in words like the following:                 bakit                               {barkit/                                   “why”
                 Juan                                {hwarn{                                    ‘Juan’
                 marso                               {marrsoh/                                  ‘March’
                 pares                               /parres/                                   ‘pair’faf in a phrase-final syllable is also represented by the [a] allophone. Thus the [a] allophone occurs in such
words as:                 bola                                {borlah/                                   ‘ball
                 Klima                               /klitmah/                                  ‘climate®
                 pekas                               /pekas/                                    ‘freckles’
                 sulat                               /suclat/                                   ‘letter’Short /a/ in a non-phrase-final syllable is usually represented by the [9] allophone. Thus [9] would
normally occur in words like the following:                 ako                                   Jakoh/                                   T
                 damit                                 /damit/                                  ‘dress’
                 magaling                              /magalin/                                ‘excellent’
                 sandali                               f/sandali’}                              ‘moment’Short /a/ in a non-phrase-final       syllable   may, however, be represented        by   [a]   in especially careful or
emphatic speech.§1.9. fof.
      The principal allophones of the Tagalog phoneme /o/ are [o] and [9]: respectively, upper-mid-back
rounded and lower-mid-back rounded. The allophone {o} is similar to the vowel that occurs as the first
element     of a diphthong in Midland       American     English     ‘boat’ /oowt/ or ‘bow’ (‘bowknot’) /bow/. The
allophone [9] is similar to the vowel of Midwestern American English ‘bought’ /bot/ or ‘Baugh’ /bo/.
      As in the case of the other mid-vowel phoneme, /e/ (see §1.7), the two allophones of /o/ are in free
alternation   for some      speakers, while others prefer one or the other of the allophones in some or all
contexts, Once again, then, cither allophone may be used to represent the phoneme in all cases.

alternation between /i/ and /e/, alternation between /u/ and /o/ is characteristic mainly of that part of the
Tagalog vocabulary which is of native Tagalog origin. The large stock of Tagalog words borrowed from
Spanish and English, on the other hand, shows relatively little alternation between /o/ and fu/. In
particular, it may be noted that, in a non-word-final syllable, long /o/ (which occurs in this position almost
exclusively in words of foreign origin) is never replaced by long /u/. The long /o/’s of the following words,
for example, are perfectly stable:               bola                           [oo-lah/                             ‘ball’

               notebook                       /notbuk/                             ‘notebook’
               oras                           /’orras/                             ‘time’       In a few cases, long /o/ may occur as an alternant of the diphthong /aw/ or the sequence /au/. These
cases are discussed in §1.11.
§1.10. /u/.
     The principal allophones of the Tagalog phoneme /u/ are [u] and (v]: respectively, upper-high-back
rounded and lower-high-back rounded. The allophone [u] is similar to the vowel that occurs as the first
element of a diphthong in English ‘boot’ /buwt/ or ‘boo’ /buw/. The allophone [vu] is similar to the vowel
of English ‘put’ /put/.
       A long /u/ is usually represented by the (u] allophone. Thus the [u] allophone is normal in words
like the following:
               grupo                          {gru:poh/                            ‘group’

like the following:               lunsod                        /lunsod/                             ‘city’

foreign origin. In this position, short /u/, though normally represented by the[v] allophone, may be
represented by the [u} allophone if the phrase-final word is being emphasized. Some further examples of

PRONUNCIATION
[uf in a phrase-final syllable are:
                 konsul                               /kornsul/                                  ‘consul’

fuf. The most important instances of alternation are those in which a word that normally has short /of ina
phrase-final syllable is used non-phrase-finally. Under these circumstances, /o/ is always replaced by /u/ if
the word is of native Tagalog origin. Thus the following words have /o/ in their final syllable if they appear
at the end of a phrase, but /u/ in their final syllable if they appear in the middle of a phrase:      ano        Janoh/      ‘what?’                  but             ano pa      f'anu pah/       ‘what else?”
      opo        fo:po’}     ‘yes, sir’               but             oponga      f‘opucna’s       ‘yes indeed, sir’
      ulo        Jurloh{   — ‘head’                   but             ulo ko      J'wlukoh/      — ‘my head’      (Note that the change from /o/ to fu/ is not reflected in the conventional spelling. See § § 1.14 and
1.17 for the dropping of word-final }""} and /h/ in the middle of a phrase, and § 1.12 for the compensatory
vowel lengthening that accompanies the dropping of word-final /’/.)
      In words of foreign origin that have short /o/ in their final syllable, when phrase-final /o/ alternates
freely with /u/ for most speakers in most cases when the word is used non-phrase-finally. Thus:
      asbestos ba              asbestos bah/                     or            fasbe-stus bah/             ‘asbestos?’
      dialog ba                {daryalog bah/                    or            {daryalug bah/              ‘dialog?’
      mascot ba                /marskot bah}                     or            /marskut bah/               ‘mascot?’
      pingpong ba              /pinpon bah/                      or            [pi*npun bah/               ‘pingpong?’       Sporadic replacement of short fof by short /u/ in a non-word-final syllable may also occur, but in
general short /o/ in this position is fairly stable. Replacement of short /o/ by short /u/ may thus occur
occasionally in words like the following,but the forms with /o/ are normal:
      onorable                                        Jonora’bleh/                               ‘honorable’
      otomatik                                        J’otomartik/                               ‘automatic’       There are also certain words in which short /o/ and short /u/ in a non-word-final syllable alternate
freely with one another. Thus:      biyolin              /biyoli-n/                       or                 [biyulien/                  ‘violin’
      doktrina             /doktrnah/                       or                 /duktrienah/                ‘doctrine’
      tsuper               [tSope'r/                        or                 {t8upe'r/                   ‘chauffeur’
       In addition to the cases of alternation between /o/ and /u/ already discussed, there are two other
cases that are discussed in subsequent sections: cases of alternation between the diphthongs /oy/ and /uy/,
to be discussed in §1.11; and cases of replacement of short /o/ by long /u/ as a result of the length-shifting
effect of certain suffixes, to be discussed in § 1.12.
       In spite of the many cases of alternation between /o/ and /u/, there is no doubt that the two are
distinct phonemes in Tagalog, since there are a number of pairs of words whose members differ from cach
other only in that one has /o/ while the other has /u/. Example of such pairs are:      baboy         /baboy/            “pig’                babuy          /babuy/               *pig-like person’

14                                                                                                       CHAPTER I
§1.11.      Diphthongs.
      As was stated in §1.5, a diphthong may be defined, for practical purposes, as a vowel followed by a
glide consonant in the same syllable. Tagalog has two glides, /y/ and /w/, which are presented in detail in
$1.21. After a vowel in the same syllable, /y/ represents a glide from the tongue and lip position of the
vowel to extreme high-front vowel position with spread lips, /w/ a glide to extreme high-back vowel
position with rounded lips. Diphthongs formed with /y/ are called FRONTING DIPIITHONGS; diphthongs
formed with /w/,   BACKING        DIPHTHONGS.
      Tagalog has four fronting diphthongs: fey/, /ay/, foy/, and /uy/. In most cases the vowels in these
diphthongs are short. Long vowels, however, occur in certain words of foreign origin: e.g.,                reyna                           /re-ynah{                               ‘queen’
                ice box                         [‘arys barks/                           ‘ice box’
                boyfriend                       {boyfren(d)/                            ‘boy friend’
                Uy                              fury!                                   (Chinese surname)      fey/ is similar to the diphthong of English ‘bay’/bey. With a short vowel, /ey/ occurs primarily as an
alternant of /ay/, as explained below, but it also occurs as a primary diphthong in a few words of foreign
origin: e.g., Reynaldo /reynaidoh/ (man’s name).
       The diphthong /ay/ is similar to the diphthong of English by /bay/. /ey/ may occur as an alternant of
any short /ay/ which is not phrase-final. In rapid speech, fe'/ may also occur as an alternant of a short
non-phrase-final fay/. Thus, while words like bahay ‘house’ or suklay ‘comb’ have /ay/ in their final syllable
if they occur at the end of a phrase, they may have either /ey/ or fe‘/, as well as /ay/, in this syllable if they
occur in the middle of a phrase:                   Phrase-Final                                         Non-phrase-Final
      bahay           /barhay/        ‘house’         bahay ko           {barhay koh/            ‘my house’
                                                                         /bathey koh/
                                                                         {barhe* koh/      suklay          {suklay/        ‘comb’          suklay ko          fsuklay koh/            ‘my comb’
                                                                         {sukley koh/
                                                                         {sukle* koh/      (In a limited number of cases, {if also occurs as an alternant of short non-phrase-final /ay/ in rapid
speech: thus, also /bachi koh/)
      Since short /ay/ alternates with fey/ and /e*/ in any non-phrase-final syllable, there are certain words
which always allow the alternation, either because the words never occur phrase-finally, or because the /ay/
occurs in a non-final syllable of the word. Some examples are:      aywan                  f’aywanf, /‘eywan/, /’e-wan/                                  ‘not known*
      kay                    fkay/, /key/, /ke-]                                           (personal marker)
      may                    /may/, /mey/, /me*/                                           ‘have, there is*
      mayroon                /mayru’on/, /meyru'on/, /me-ru’on/                            ‘have, there is’      In certain cases the diphthong /ay/ occurs as an alternant of the sequence /a’i/. The alternants /ey/
and fe: also occur in these cases. Thus:      kaibigan /ka’ibigan/, /kaybi-gan/, /keybi-gan/, /ke*bi-gan/ ‘friend""
      kailan /ka’ilan/, /kaylan/, /keylan/, /keslan/ ‘when’      The Tagalog diphthong foy/ is similar to the diphthong of English ‘boy’ /boy/. The Tagalog
diphthong /uy/ is similar to the diphthong of English ‘buoy’ /buy/ (where this is differentiated from *boy’).
In Tagalog, phrase-final fuy/ occurs primarily as an emphatic alternant of foy/. There are, however, a few
words that have only /uy/, never /oy/, in a phrase-final syllable: eg., any /‘aruy/ ‘ouch’, babuy /ba-buy/
‘pig-like person’. (The last word contrasts minimally with baboy /ba-boy/ ‘pig’.)
PRONUNCIATION                                                                                                                1S
       Just as /uy/ is relatively rare in a phrase-final syllable, so /oy/ is relatively rare elsewhere, since, as was
explained in $1.10, an /o/ in the last syllable of a native Tagalog word is regularly replaced by /u/ when the
word is not phrase-final. Thus:
       amoy                Pamoy/          ‘odor’          but           amoy ba          /‘amuy bah/            ‘odor?*
       kahoy           [kahoy/             ‘wood’          but           kahoy ba         {kashuy bah/           ‘wood?’Only in words borrowed from other languages may                       a word-final foy/ be retained in the middle of a
phrase: e.g., cowboy ba /ko*boy bah/ ‘cowboy?’.
       The Tagalog backing diphthongs are: fiw/, few/, /aw/, and /ow/. (/aw/ occurs with a long vowel in a
few words of foreign origin — e.g., loudspeaker flawdispi-ker! — but is short in all other cases. fiw/, few/,
and /ow/ always have short vowels.) Most dialects of English have no diphthongs that are similar to /iw/ or
few/. (Jiw/ occurs, however, in Southeastern American English in certain words where other dialects have
lyuw/ or juw/:        ¢.g., ‘due’, ‘new’, and /ew/ occurs in some British dialects in words where other dialects
have fow/: ¢.g., ‘boat’, ‘no’.) In Tagalog, few/ occurs only as an optional alternant of fiw/ in a phrase-final
syllable, in some words, for some speakers. (See §1.7 for a discussion of alternation between ij and Je/ ina
phrase-final syllable.) Thus some speakers pronounce words like sisiw ‘chick’ or baliw ‘crazy* with cither
fiw] or few/ if they are phrase-final, but only with fiw/ if they occur elsewhere, Other speakers have /fiw/ in
all cases.
        The Tagalog diphthong faw/ is similar to the diphthong of English ‘brow* /braw/. In a non-final
syllable, some speakers occasionally replace a short /aw/ by /ow/ or by the long vowel /o-/, in rapid speech.
(/ow/, which occurs in Tagalog only as an occasional alternant of faw/, is similar to the diphthong of
English ‘boat’ /bowt/.) Thus, sporadic pronunciations of, for example, ikaw ba ‘you?’ as [ikow bah/ or
f‘iko+bah/ may be heard, in addition to the usual pronunciation /‘ikaw bah/.
        In many cases the diphthong /aw/ occurs as an alternant of the sequence /a‘u/ in capid speech. Ina
few such cases pronunciations with /o-/ or fow/ also occur: e.g.,
       kaunti /ka‘unti'/, /kawnti'/, /kownti'/, /kornti’? ‘a little’
       magsauli /magsa’uli’/, /magsawli’}, /magsowli’/, /magsorli’/ ‘return’§1.12 Vowel length.
       Vowel       length,     or   duration,   is significant    in Tagalog.   There   are    pairs of utterances   that   are
distinguished from one another on the basis of vowel length alone. Thus it is only the difference in the
length of the vowel of the second syllable that distinguishes the verb magnanakaw /magnana*kaw/ ‘will rob’
from the noun magnanakaw /magnana-kaw/ ‘robber’,
       Tagalog vowels are characterized by one of two degrees of significant relative length. The significantly
longer vowels may            be called   LONG       VOWELS,      the significantly shorter vowels may be called SHORT
VOWELS. (In the phonemic notation used in this book, long vowels are marked by a raised dot after the
vowel.) Every significantly long vowel of Tagalog may be explained as an instance of one of the three follow-
ing   cases   of   vowel      length:    INHERENT      LENGTH,       COMPENSATORY             LENGTH,    or COALESCENCE
LENGTH. These cases are dealt with in tum below. Then the phenomena of NON-SIGNIFICANT
LENGTHENING and LENGTH SHIFT are discussed. (For a discussion of the relationship between
vowel Iength and stress, see § 1.29.)      By INHERENT LENGTH is meant vowel length that is present in a word regardless of the position of
the word in an utterance. In words of native Tagalog origin, inherently long vowels occur only in syllables
that are not word-final. Thus monosyllabic words of native Tagalog origin — e.g., the markers ang, sa, Si,
etc. — never have inherently long vowels. The vowels of monosyllabic loan-words from English and Spanish,
on the other hand, are always inherently long. The following proper names, for example, have long vowels
regardless of their position in an utterance:
                    Bill                  {birlf                                Luz                  flurs/
                    Fe                    {ferh}                                Boy                  [bo-y/
                    Bob                   /ba-b/
16                                                                                                                 CHAPTER I       Final syllables of disyllabic or longer words of native origin never have inherently long vowels. Final
syllables of disyllabic or longer words from English (but not from Spanish) sometimes have inherently long
vowels in free alteration with short vowels. That is, the vowels of the final syllables of such words may be
either long or short if the words occur in the middle of a phrase. (This is in contrast to words of native
origin, all of which have only short vowels in their final syllables under these circumstances.) Some
examples are:      balloon ba                foalu:n bah/                      or         /balun bah/              ‘balloon?*
      cartoon ba                /kartu'n bah/                     or         /kartun bah/             ‘cartoon?’      Tagalog has many pairs of words that differ from one another only in that one member of the pair
has an inherently long vowel in a non-final syllable while the other has a short vowel in this syllable. Some
examples are:      aso          [asoh{          ‘dog’                    vs,        aso            f’asoh/         *smoke*
      baga         foagah{       = ‘ember’                 vs.         baga           /oagah/         ”

the left-hand member          of each pair being stressed on the first syllable, the right-hand member on the
second — sce §1.29.)                                                          ;
      By COMPENSATORY LENGTH is meant length that appears with the dropping of a consonant after
an otherwise short vowel. Certain cases of compensatory length have already been presented in
§1.11: namely,     the long /e-/ and /o:/ that occur as alternants of diphthongs. The length of these
vowels   ~ in, for example aywun ‘not known"", pronounced fe-wan/, and kaunti, ‘a little’, pronounced
/kornti’/ — may be regarded as an instance of length compensating for the loss of a following glide
consonant.
      Another, and still more frequent, case of compensatory lengthening is the lengthening of vowels in
word-final syllables that accompanies the loss of a following glottal stop in the middle of a phrase. (The
glottal-stop phoneme is not represented in conventional spelling, but is represented by the symbol /""/ in
phonemic transcriptions. See §1.14 for a general discussion of the phoneme.) Tagalog has a great many
words that end with a glottal stop: e.g.,               baba                                  {barba’/                                   ‘chin’
               hindi                                 fhindi’/                                   ‘no’
               luto                                  flu-to’/                                   ‘cooked’When such words occur in the middle of a phrase, the glottal stop                          does not occur, but        there   is
compensatory lengthening of the vowel of the word-final syllable. Thus:               baba ba                               /ba-ba* bah/                               ‘chin?*
               hindi ba                              {hindi+ bah/                               ‘no?*
               luto ba                               /lustus bah/                               ‘cooked?’(As was noted in §1.10, /o/ in the final syllable of a word of native Tagalog origin is always replaced by /u/
if the word is used non-phrase-finally. Therefore /u:/ results from the compensatory lengthening of /o/, as
in the Jast example above.)
      COALESCENCE         LENGTH           is length that is the product of the merging of two identical vowels that
have become contiguous as the result of the omission of a glottal stop. A glottal stop between vowels is
often omitted in normal rapid speech. The sentence Nasaan na ako? ‘Where am | now?’, for example, which
would have two intervocalic glottal stops in careful speech — /na’sa’an na ’akoh/ — would normally lose
them both in rapid speech, and the contiguous identical vowels would coalesce into long vowels: /na’san
PRONUNCIATION                                                                                                   17
nakoh/. As the above example shows, coalescence length may result from the merging of vowels cither
within a word (stasaan) or between two words (na ako).
       In addition to the three types of significant vowel length just discussed, Tagalog also shows
NON-SIGNIFICANT LENGTHENING of the vowels of phrase-final syllables. All Tagalog vowels in
phrase-final syllables are phonetically long. This being the case, vowel length in a phrase-final syllable is not
significant — i.c., there is no possibility of contrast between long and short vowels in this position — and
hence, in general, it is not marked in the phonemic transcriptions of this text. In phonetic transcriptions, on
the other hand, all vowels in phrase-final syllables are shown as long. Thus isa ‘one’ is transcribed
phonemically /‘isah/, phonetically [‘isach] , and apart ‘four’ is transcribed phonemically /’a*pat/, phonetically
[‘a‘part]. (In phonemic transcriptions of phrase-final monosyllabic loan words, however, vowel length is
shown. As noted above, all monosyllabic loan words have inherently long vowels — i.e., vowels that are long
regardless of the position in which the word occurs. While it is true that such length is not in itself
significant phrase-finally, there being no possibility of length contrast in this position, phrase-final
monosyllabic loan words are nonetheless distinguished from phrase-final monosyllables of native Tagalog
origin by the way in which      they are treated in texically-determined two-point intonation patterns — see
§§1.23 and 1.25. In these patterns, phrase-final monosyllabic loans are given the treatment accorded other
syllables with significantly long vowels.)
      By LENGTH SHIFT is meant the transfer of vowel length from one syllable of a word to another,
Length shift in Tagalog is associated with a number of different word-types — notably, verbs formed with
the two verbal suffixes —an and -in. (A VERBAL SUFFIX is a sequence of phonemes that is added toa
word to form a verb.) When either of these suffixes is added to a word that contains an inherently long
vowel, this vowel is normally shortened and the vowel in the following syllable is simultaneously
lengthened. For example:      tasa /tarsah/ ‘assessment’ > tasahan /tasashan/ ‘(to) assess’
      pala /parlah/ ‘shovel’ > palahin /pala-hin/ ‘(to) shovel’(Length shift does not occur in those few cases where the inherently long vowel is in a closed syllable, i.e., a
syllable ending in a consonant (cf. §1.22). Thus when the suffix —in is added to plantsa /plantsah/ ‘iron’,
the resultant form, plantsahin {pla‘ntSahin/ ‘(to) iron’, does not show length shift.)
      There are certain changes of vowel quality that are associated with length shift. These changes
concern the lengthening of short /e/ and /o/. In certain specifiable cases, short /e/ is replaced by long /i-/,
and short /o/ by long /us/. In other specifiable cases, the original vowel quality is retained under length
shift. The condition that determines whether or not the vowel quality is retained is the quality of the vowel
that precedes the /e/ or/o/. If this preceding vowel is either /e/ or /o/, then /e/ is lengthened to /e*/ and /o/
to fo}. If the preceding vowel is /i/, /a/, or /u/, however, then fe/ is replaced by /i‘/ and fo/ by fu’.
Examples of the retention of vowel quality when the preceding vowel is /e/ or /o/ are:      kolorete /kolore-teh/ ‘rouge’ > koloretehan /koloreteshan/ ‘rouge’
      lote florteh} ‘lot’ -* lotehin /lote-hin/ ‘(to) parcel’
      belo /be-loh/ ‘veil’ - belohan /belohan/ ‘(to) veil’
      lobo /lo-boh/ ‘balloon’ ~ lobohin /loborhin/ *(to) make into a balloon’Examples of the change of vowel quality when the preceding vowel is /i/, /a/, or /u/ are:      tiket /ticket/ ‘ticket’ > tikitan /tikitan/ ‘(to) give a ticket’
      dibate /dibateh/ ‘debate’ > dibatihin /dibati‘hin/ ‘(to) debate with’
      ule fuleh/ ‘oilcloth’ > ulihan /’uli-han/ ‘(to) put oilcloth on’
      pino /pirnoh/ ‘fine’ > pinuhin /pinushin/ ‘(to) make fine’
      palo /paslo'/ ‘fogging’ > paluin /palu-in/ ‘(to) flog’
      saludo /salu:doh/ ‘salute’ - saluduhan /saluduchan/ ‘(to) salute’

      (In other cases, sa-phrase object complements may occur only after nominalized verbs.) §5.24. Irregular verb formations.
      Certain verbs formed with the suffixes -an and -i, or with complex affixes that include these suffixes
(eg., Ka-...-an, pa-...-in), are irregular. In irregular verb formations, the shape of the verb base shows
certain differences from the shape of the same base in citation or in formations that do not include a suffix.
(The differences referred to are differences other than those that reflect the regular process of length
shift - cf. §1.12 —or the regular phonemic interchanges of fo/ and fu/, /d/ and /r/ — cf. §§1.10 and
1.20.) The most common type of irregular formation involves clision of the vowel in the final syllable of a
base that lacks inherent vowel length. Thus, for example, the base bukas fbukas/ forms, with -an, the
irregular verb buksan /buksan/ ‘open.’ (This may be compared with the regular formation wakasan
{wakasan/ ‘put a stop to,’ formed with the base wakas /wakas/.) Elision of this type, which characterizes a
number of the most common -an and -in verbs in the language, occurs very rarely in cases where the
penultimate syllable of the base ends in a consonant: thus, puna /puntah/ +-an > puntahan {puntahan/
‘go to.” (Note, however, the form hintin /hintin/ ‘wait for,’ formed with the base Aintay fhintay/, which
does show elision of the vowel in the final syllable of the base, as well as elision of the base — final
consonant.) When the citation form of the base ends in /‘/ and the vowel of the base—final syllable is
deleted in an irregular verb formation, the /""/ is also deleted. An example is gawin /gawin/ ‘make, do,’ an -in
verb formed with the base gawa /gawa’/.
       The occurring irregular -an and -in formations are listed below in alphabetical order. Only the basic
forms of the irregular verbs are shown, but it is to be understood that the inflected forms generally show
the same irregularities. Thus the inflected forms of the irregular verb bigyan /bigyan/ ‘give to’ (base: bigay
fdigay/): are: bibigyan /bi-bigyan/ ‘will give to,’ binibigyan /bini-bigyan/ ‘is/are giving to,’ binigyan
/binigyan/ ‘gave to.’ In the case of irregular verbs whose basic form includes the suffix -in, however, the
imperfective and perfective forms of the verb are regular, since the suffix does not occur in these forms (cf.
§§5.20 and 5.21). Thus, the imperfective and perfective forms of the irregular verb hingin /hinin/ ‘ask for’
(base: hingi fhini’/) are, respectively, the regular formations hinihingt {hini-hini'/ ‘isfare asking for’ and
hiningi [hinini’/ ‘asked for.*
      In most cases, the listed irregular formations are -an2 or -int verbs. It is to be understood, however, that
any verbs formed with the same base and with complex affixes that include the suffix -an or the suffix -in
show the same irregularities of formation. Thus, while only bigyam ‘give to’ appears on the list, such derived
verbs as mabigy'an ‘be able to give to,” pabigyan ‘permit/cause to give to,’ pagbigyan ‘give (to) at/in, ctc.,
are also irregular. In cases where the base forms irregular verbs with complex affixes that include -an or -in,
but either does not occur with -a or -in alone, or does not form irregular verbs with them, a pertinent
formation that includes a complex affix is listed.
       In some cases, a base occurs with -avz or -in in both regular and irregular formations. In some cases, if
the two formations have the same meaning, only the irregular formation is given, and an asterisk is placed
after it. Thus the notation dakpin® (/dakpin/ ‘arrest’ — base: dakip /dakip/) indicates that, in addition to
the irregular formation, there is a regular formation with the same meaning (dakipin /dakipin/ ‘arrest’. If
the regular formation is considerably more common            than the irregular one, the asterisk is immediately
preceded by the letter r (for ‘rare’) in parenthesis. Thus the notation alsan (r)* (/‘alsan/ ‘leave’ — base: alis
f'alisf) indicates that there is a regular formation that has the same meaning and is of considerably more
common    occurrence (alisan /‘alisan/ ‘leave’). If the regular and irregular formations differ in meaning, a
note on the occurrence and meaning of the regular formation appears below the listing of the irregular
formation. Notes of various other kinds may also follow the listing in some cases.

§5.25. Summary of verbal complements.
          Tagalog has verbal complements of four types: actor complements, object complements, directional
complements,        and   secondary—actor      complements.   A   detailed   presentation    of   secondary—actor
complements is to be found in §5,12, subsection (1), and no further information about them is presented
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                              381
in the present section. The three types of complements that occur in basic sentences — actor, object, and
directional complements — have been introduced in §2.11; the present section summarizes the information
previously given about these complement types, and presents certain additional details.
       (1) THE ACTOR COMPLEMENT. The actor complement is in most cases expressed by a ng
phrase: ng plus an unmarked noun, mi plus a personal noun, the ng form of a personal or deictic
pronoun: e.g.,                                ng babae
                                ni Helen
               Binili                            ang baro.
                                niya
                                noon               ‘The/A woman
               ‘Helen
                                       bought the dress.’
               ‘She
               ‘That one
An actor complement consisting of mg plus an unmarked noun is usually equivalent to a definite noun
phrase in English (e.g., ‘the woman’), but may occasionally be translated by an indefinite noun phrase as
well (e.g., ‘a woman’). The connotation of definiteness is least clear when the unmarked noun is explicitly
pluralized (cf. §3.9). Thus in the sentence:               Binili ng mga babae ang mga baro.
               ‘The/Some women bought the dresses.”the indefinite noun phrase ‘some women’ is as likely a translation equivalent of ng mga babae as is the
definite noun phrase ‘the women.”
      When the nominal within an actor complement is a personal pronoun, a sa-form pronoun may in
some cases be used instead of the ng-form pronoun. Unlike the ng-form pronoun, the sa-form pronoun
precedes the verb and is linked to it by the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11). Any enclitic pronouns and/or particles
(cf. §§3.29 and 6.2 through 6.6) occur between the sa pronoun and the linker. The following are some
examples of sentences with sa pronouns serving as actor complements. (The equivalent sentences with
ng-pronoun actor complements are cited in parentheses.)               Aking gagawin ito.
               ‘Til do this.’
               (cf. Gagawin ko ito.)               Amin siyang tatawagin.
               ‘We'll call him.”
               (cf.     Tatawagin namin siya.)               Kanila din bang dadaluhan ang pulong?
               Will they attend the meeting too?’
               (cf.     Dadaluhan din ba nila ang pulong?)      Sa-pronoun actor complements do not occur in negated sentences. Thus there is no:               *Aking hindi
                                       gagawin ito.
               *Hindi aking

corresponding to:               Hindi ko gagwin ito.
               *I won’t do this.’       (The alternation between ng-pronoun and sa-pronoun actor complements is comparable to that
between ng-pronoun and sa-pronoun possessive modifiers — cf. §3.20.)
       (2) THE OBJECT COMPLEMENT. In basic sentences the object complement is expressed by a ng
phrase, which must be either ng plus an unmarked noun or the ng form of a deictic pronoun: c.g.,                                { ng aksidente
               Nakakita                                    ang bata.
                                l noon                                         f an accident.”
               ‘The child saw
                                         l some of that.”","[386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393]"
"(This tendency    of short components       to precede   Jong components     is particularly   apparent   in derived
sentences, in which the length differences between components may be more striking. Thus the placement
of the adverb (BUKAS) before the expanded topic (ang iseng babaeng, etc.) in the following sentence
represents a very much more likely ordering of components than would the reverse:                 Darating bukas ang isang babaeng nakilala ko sa probinsya.
                 ‘A woman I met in the provinces is coming tomorrow.’)

Nominals   and   Their    Expansions
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                                                               87§3.1. Introduction.
        The        preceding   chapter      introduced      four        major   classes    of     sentence   components:       NOMINALS,
ADJECTIVALS, VERBALS, and ADVERBIALS. The present chapter and the three that follow it examine
these classes in detail. In each case, information is given not only about the members of the class that occur
in basic sentences, but also about certain EXPANSIONS of the class and certain other DERIVED CON-
STRUCTIONS relevant primarily to the class.
        An EXPANSION             is a structure that does not itself occur in basic sentences, but that occurs in some
or all of the same             contexts     as a particular class of basic-sentence components. An expansion of a
component          class may    consist of a member          of the class plus some other structural element(s), or it may
consist of a structure that entirely replaces a member of the class. For example, an English noun phrase like
‘a question’, which occurs in a basic sentence like ‘The man asked the woman a question’, may be replaced
by such constructions as ‘a difficult question’ and ‘what to do’: *The man asked the woman a difficult
question’, ‘the man asked the woman what to do’. Both constructions may be considered expansions of the
noun phrase. In one case, ‘a difficult question’, the noun phrase itself appears in the expansion; in the
other, ‘what to do’, it does not.
      A DERIVED CONSTRUCTION is any construction that does not itself occur in a basic sentence, but
that is related to a construction that does so occur. An expansion, therefore, is one type of derived
construction. There are, however, other types. For example, ‘The woman was asked a question by the man’
may be considered to be derived from ‘The man asked the woman a question’, yet does not include any
expansions.
        Derived constructions of the type just exemplified,                            which       show, rather than an expansion, a
rearrangement          of sentence        components     and/or         the addition       and/or    the deletion     of components,        are
discussed in one of two places in the present text. If the derived construction is best understood in relation
to a particular class of basic-sentence components, it is discussed in connection with that class in Chapters
3, 4, 5, or 6. If, on the other hand, the derived construction is not relevant primarily to a particular class of
basic-sentence         components,         it is discussed         in     Chapter    7,     DERIVED          AND     MINOR      SENTENCE
STRUCTURES.              Thus, for example, the various derived verb focuses (benefactive :ocus, causative focus,
etc.) are dealt with in Chapter 5, VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS, since they are best understood in
relation to the class of verbal structures, while negation, a gencral phenomenon                                     that is pertinent to a
number of different component-classes and structure types, is dealt with in Chapter 7.
     The present chapter is arranged as follows. §§3.2 through 3.8 deal with the various classes of
nominal words that occur in Tagalog:                 marked nouns (3.2), personal pronouns (3.3), deictic pronouns (3.4),
personal nouns (3.5), unmarked nouns (3.6), derived noun formations (3.7), and nominal compounds (3.8).
§3.9 is concerned with the pluralization of nominals, §3.10 with coordinate nominal constructions.
Modification constructions other than possessive modification constructions are presented in §§3.11
through 3.19; possessive modification constructions are presented in §3.20. Reflexive and intensive
nominal constructions are presented in §3.21, limiters and limited nominal constructions in §3.22, and ng
phrases       of     specification   in     §3.23.    The    next        five   sections    are     concerned      with   various   types    of
nominalizations: nominalized adjectivals and verbals (3.24), nominalized basic forms (3.25), gerunds (3.26),
nominalized verb bases (3.27), and nominal clauses (3.28). §3.29 deals with enclitic personal pronouns.","[95, 96, 97]"
"In Tagalog too, nonrestrictive modifiers constitute separate intonation phrases while restrictive modifiers
normally do not:      ang mga mag-aaral, na nagtrabaho nang masikap,... (two phrases)
      ‘the students, who worked hard...’vs.   ang mga mag-aaral na nagtrabaho nang masikap... (one phrase)
      ‘the students who worked hard...’      Another similarity between English and Tagalog nonrestrictive modifiers is that, in both languages,
such modifiers always follow their heads. Thus the reversibility of head and modifier that has been ascribed,
in preceding sections, to Tagalog modification constructions as a group does not apply in cases when the
modifier is nonrestrictive. In all cases of nonrestrictive modification, the head is the first element of the
construction, the modifier the second.
      The fact that a nonrestrictive modifier always constitutes a separate intonation phrase, and is
consequently preceded by a pause, has consequences for the shape of the linker a-/-ng in nonrestrictive
132                                                                                                   CHAPTER 3modification. As was noted in §3.11, only the /na/ form of the linker occurs after a pause, whatever may
be the final consonant of the independent form of the pre-pausal word. Therefore, in cases where the /n/
form of the linker occurs before a restrictive modifier (i.¢., cases where the preceding word ends, in its
independent form, in /h/, /*/, or /n/), there is, in addition to the pause, a second formal distinction between
modification    constructions     involving nonrestrictive       modifiers   and   those   involving   restrictive
modifiers: namely, the distinction between the /na/ and the /n/ forms of the linker. Thus:      ang mga ¢studyante, na nagtrabaho nang masikap
      ‘the students, who worked hard’vs.   ang mga estudyanteng nagtrabaho nang masikap
      ‘the students who worked hard’       There are certain types of structures that may serve freely as restrictive modifiers but that either do
not occur or occur rarely as nonrestrictive modifiers. Unmarked nouns, for example, do not occur as
nonrestrictive modifiers unless they themselves are modified. Thus, while there are restrictive constructions
like ang guro kong Amerikana ‘my American teacher’ or ‘my teacher who is an American’, there are no
constructions like “ang guru ko, na Amerikana. (To express the equivalent of ‘my teacher, who is an
American’, Tagalog requires the use of isa ‘one/a(n)' plus linker within the nonsestrictive modifier: ang
guro ko, na isang Amerikana.)                             .
       One-word adjectives occur rarcly if at all as nonrestrictive modifiers, except when the adjectives are
intensified. (Cf. §4.12 for the intensification of adjectives.) While constructions like ang guro ko, na
napakahusay or ang guro ko, na mahusay na mahusay ‘my teacher, who is very good’ are quite acceptable
(napakahusay and mahusay na mahusay are doth intensifications of mahusay ‘good’), constructions like ang
guro ko, na mahusay are of questionable grammaticalness.","[141, 142]"
"By analogy with ng phrases of similar meaning that occur in verbals, the mg phrase in a pseudo-verb phrase
may be called the ACTOR COMPLEMENT of the pseudo-verb. (The pseudo-verb ayaw contracts with the
actor complement ko /koh/ — the ng-form of the first person singular pronoun — to form a single
word:   ayoko }’ayo'koh/ ‘I don't like/want (to)’.
       None of the pseudo-verbs occurs in all cight of the listed construction types. Ayaw occurs in
construction types (1) through (7), Xailangan in construction types (1), (2), and (5) through (8). Guszo,
ibig, and nais occur in construction types (1) through (3) and (5) through (7). Dapat, maaari, and puwede
occur only in construction type (8).

      (1) PSEUDO-VERB           PHRASE          PLUS DEFINITE     OBJECT. Any pseudo-verb but dapat, maaari, and
puwede may occur in this construction (and in the following one). The construction consists of a
pseudo-verb phrase (pseudo-verb plus actor complement — see above) followed by a phrase that is
translated by a definite object (‘the’ plus noun, etc.) in the English equivalents. Normally, this phrase is an
ang phrase (ang plus an unmarked noun, si(na) plus a personal noun, or the avg form of a personal or
deictic pronoun): e.g.,                  Kailangan
                  Gusto
                  Ibig                      ni Pedro ang libro.

                  ‘We               like/want                     that.’
                                    don’t like/want       If the pseudo-verb is gusto or ayaw, an animate definite object (person or animal) may — or, in some
cases, for some speakers, must — be expressed by a sa phrase (sa plus an unmarked noun or plus the sa form
of a personal pronoun, kay/kina plus a personal noun, or the sa form of a deictic pronoun). Thus most
speakers may use either an ang phrase or a sa phrase to express the definite object in such sentences as:                                                 ang

§4.19.    Locative adjective phrases.
       Tagalog has LOCATIVE PHRASES (phrases expressing location) of two classes: LOCATIVE
ADJECTIVE PHRASES and LOCATIVE ADVERBIAL PHRASES. Locative adjective phrases are discussed
in the present section; locative adverbial phrases are discussed in §6.9.
       Locative adjective phrases normally consist of a /na‘/ plus a sa phrase. When the nominal in the sa
phrase is an unmarked noun or (the sa form of) a personal pronoun, na and sa are conventionally written as
a single word:                 nasa kusina             ‘in the kitchen’                                         ‘with you’
                 nasa iyo
                                         ‘in your possession’
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                            255When the nominal in the sa phrase is a personal noun,sa is replaced by Xay (or its plural counterpart kina),
and na is conventionally written as a separate word:                                      ‘with Nena’
               na kay Nena
                                          ‘in Nena’s possession’                                     {wien Nena and her friends’
               na kina Nena
                                     lin the possession of Nena and her friends’When the nominal in the sa phrase is a deictic pronoun, the sa form of a deictic is used. As was noted in
§3.4, the sa forms of the deictics are: dine, dito, diyan and doon. In locative-adjective phrases, either the
initial /d/ of the deictic is replaced by /r/ (a common phonemic alternation -— cf. §1.20) or an /n/ is
inserted between na and the initial /d/ of the deictic. The two formations alternate freely for most speakers.
Thus:
               narine /na‘ri‘neh/         )
                                                          ‘here’
               nandine jna-ndi-neh/ |               narito /na‘ritoh/
                                                          ‘here’
               nandito /na‘ndi’toh/               naryan /na‘ryan/
                                                          ‘there’
               nandyan /na‘ndyan/               naroon /na‘ru'on/
                                                         ‘there’
               nandoon /na‘ndu’on/
In addition to the above formations, there are formations of identical meaning involving duplicating
syllables. These formations are:               naririne /na‘ri(-)ri‘neh/
                                                                    ‘here’
               nandidine /na‘ndi(-)di-neh/               naririto /na‘ri(‘)ritoh/
                                                                    ‘here*
               nandidito /na‘ndi(‘)di‘toh/               nariryan /na‘ri(*)ryan/          )

to nandoon in educated Manila Tagalog.)

       When the nominal in the locative phrase is an unmarked noun representing a place or an inanimate

"      Object complements in basic sentences are normally translated by indefinite noun phrases in English.
      Within a nominalized verbal (cf. §3.24), an object complement is in some cases expressed by a ng
phrase, in others by asa phrase, and in still others may be expressed by either a ng phrase or a sa phrase.
Only a ng phrase may be used if the verb within the nominalized verbal is a double—object verb. Once more
the ng phrase must be either ng plus an unmarked noun or the ng form of a deictic pronoun: ¢.g.,                                              ng premyo)

definite or indefinite in reference.
       If the verb within the nominalized verbal is an object verb, and if the nominal within the object
complement is a personal noun or a personal pronoun, only a sa phrase (Kay plus personal noun, sa plus
sa-form personal pronoun) may be used to express the object complement:                      e¢.g.,                                                { kay Jose.

"(The usual equivalent of an ‘of phrase with such nouns is not a modifier, but, rather, a ng phrase of
specification — cf. §3.23. Thus ‘a picture of Manila’ is larawan ng Maynila, not *Maynilang larawan., The
reflexives, however, do not normally occur in ng phrases of specification, and a construction like /arawan ng
sarili niya is of questionable grammaticalness.) Constructions with reflexives used as modifiers are always
ambiguous, since the savili constructions in them may also be interpreted as emphatic possessives. (English
constructions like ‘his own picture’ are similarly ambiguous, and may mean either ‘a picture of himself or
‘a picture belonging to him’.) When a reflexive construction is used as a modifier, it may be preceded by the
marker ng if this is the appropriate marker for the modification constructions as a whole: e.g.,                                                               _       niyang

                            ‘Pedro was looking at a picture of himself.’Except when used as a modifier, a reflexive construction is rarely, if ever, preceded by ng.
        The Tagalog counterpart of a construction involving an English intensive pronoun (and of certain
other English constructions -- see below) is a construction involving the intensifier mismo. Mismo may be
used to intensify any marked noun, and any unmarked noun preceded by ang, ng, or sa. (It is, however, less
common with ng phrases than with eng or sa phrases.) Afiseno does not occur with unmarked nouns in
predicate position unless the nouns are definitized by a preceding ang (cf. §7.17).
      Mismo may cither precede or follow a sentence-initial marked noun. (In the case of personal nouns,
mismo either precedes the personal-noun marker or follows the noun.) When mismo precedes, it is linked to
the nominal by the linker 2a@/-1g; when it follows, no linker occurs. Thus:                     (      {Mismong ako)       _)

it may occur in any of three positions. It may precede either the marker or the noun, with linking, or it
may follow the noun, without linking. (The last is the most common.) Thus:               Mismong ang Amerikano
               Ang mismong Amesikano?               ang pumunta.

               Sa Maynila mismo
               ‘It's in Manila itself that he lives.’      A nominal intensified by mismo most often occurs at the beginning of a sentence. Occasionally,
however, a non-sentence-initial nominal may be intensified by mismo. In such cases, mismo always follows
the nominal:                                    siya

an intensive pronoun. In particular cases, it may have certain other English equivalents as well: e.g., ‘very’
and ‘right’ as in:                 Sa gitna mismo ng siyudad siya nakatira.
                 ‘He lives in the very heart of the city.’                 Dito mismo siya nakatira.
                 ‘He lives right here.’
§3.22.    Limiters and limited nominal constructions.
       The class of LIMITERS includes various words and phrases that express quantity, distribution, or
order in a series. While some limiters may be classified as nouns and others as adjectives, the members of the
class show certain differences from nouns and adjectives of other types, that make a unified presentation
convenient. (Certain details are, however, presented elsewhere in the text: e.g., the details of the formation
of cardinal and ordinal numbers, presented in §4.4.)
       The major limiters are the cardinal and ordinal numbers and the items in the following list:                 bahagi                                  ‘part (of)’
                 bawa’t                                  ‘each, every’
                 kakaunti                                ‘only a little’
                 kalahati                                ‘half (of)*
                 kapiraso                                ‘a piece of

                 kaunti                                  ‘a little, little, few’
                 hindi (ka)kaunti                        ‘quite a lot (of), not a little’

                 hindi iilan                             ‘quite a few, not a few""
                 huli                                    ‘(the) last”
                 iilan                                   ‘only a few’
                 ilan                                    ‘a few, some, certain’
                 lahat                                   ‘all’

                 parte                                   ‘part (of)(The notation hindi (kajkaunti signifies free alternation between the fonn with and the form without the
duplicating syllable. Note that the other limiters that include duplicating syllables         — Kakaunti, hindi
gagaano, and iilan — although related in meaning to their nonduplicated counterparts — Kaunti, hindi gaano,
and ilan respectively — do not alternate freely with them.)
       Two of the limiters, bawa't and lahat, are dealt with individually later in this section. The remaining
limiters are dealt with in groups, immediately below, in relation to structures of four types: unmarked
predicates, modification constructions, limiter-plus-sa-phrase constructions, and limiter-plus-ng-phrase
constructions.
       The limiters that commonly occur as unmasked predicates are: the cardinal and ordinal numbers,
kakaunti, kaunti, hindi (kajkaunti, hindi, gaano, hindi gagaano, hindi iilan, huli, iilan, and marami. The
cardinal numbers, /rindi iilan and iilan normaily occur as predicates only with count-noun topics (cf. §3.9):      Dalawa                                                                  two

iilan ang mga bulakiak, but not:          *Dalawa ang mga bulaklak).","[149, 150, 151, 152]"
"
§2.6. Verbal predicates.
       All Tagalog verbal constructions include a verb: a word that is capable of INFLECTION to indicate
aspect. (By INFLECTION is meant systematic changes in the form of words correlated with systematic
changes in meaning. Most English nouns, for example, are capable of inflection to indicate
number: *boy/boys’, ‘man/men’, etc. Aspect is defined in §2.7.) In addition to the verb, many Tagalog
verbal constructions include one or more COMPLEMENTS. A verb that accepts a complement in a basic
sentence is called a TRANSITIVE VERB; a verb that does not accept a complement in a basic sentence is
called an INTRANSITIVE VERB. (The terms transitive and intransitive are applied somewhat differently in
the case of DERIVED VERBS: verbs that occur only in derived sentences — cf. §5.1.) A transitive verb in a
basic sentence always precedes its complement(s).
       The verb itself, whether transitive or intransitive, has two components: its aspect and the BASIC
FORM of the verb. The following diagrams show the structure of basic narrational sentences as summarized
thus far:                                       Basic Sentence                                                Basic Sentence                             Predicate                  Topic                               Predicate                 Topic

                           Form                                                                          Form
§2.7. Aspect.
         The Tagalog verb system includes no true tense distinctions like the English distinction between past
and non-past: past as in ‘He lived in Manila’, ‘He worked too hard’, ‘He left this morning’; non-past
(present, habitual, or anticipated) as in ‘He lives in Manila’, ‘He works too hard’, ‘He leaves this morning’.
This English tense distinction, by means of which events are expressed as cither limited or not limited to
some time before the moment of speaking, has no genuine parallel in Tagalog.
         But the English verb system makes certain other distinctions that do have Tagalog parallels: ¢.g., the
distinction between events viewed as completed — ‘He walked down the street’ — and those viewed as
on-going — ‘He was walking down the street’. This type of distinction is a distinction of aspect.
       For purposes of describing the Tagalog verb system, aspect may be defined as the characterization of
an event as completed or not completed, and, if not completed, as begun or not begun. All Tagalog verbs
are inflectable for three aspects: PERFECTIVE, IMPERFECTIVE, and CONTEMPLATED. The perfective
aspect characterizes an event as completed, the imperfective as not completed but begun, and the
contemplated        as not begun. (Some           verbs also occur in the RECENT          PERFECTIVE         aspect, which
characterizes an event as recently completed. Recent perfective formations do not occur in basic sentences,
and are discussed in §5.23.) Since these three aspects are not associated with a tense system
(past/non-past), no one-to-one correspondences with English tense/aspect formations obtain. Each of the
Tagalog aspects has several English equivalents. The closest cquivalent in any case depends upon the
semantic and structural context in which the verb occurs.
       English has at least three different tense-aspect formations that may be used to report events as
completed. One is the simple past, as in ‘Mother cooked some food’. The second is the so-called present
perfect, as in ‘Mother has cooked some food’. And the third is the so-called past perfect, as in ‘Mother had
cooked       some   food    (when      I arrived)’. The   Tagalog counterpart of all three of these formations is the
perfective aspect — plus, in the case of the counterparts of the English present perfect and past perfect, the
enclitic particle na (cf. § 6.3):
BASIC SENTENCE       STRUCTURE                                                                                                       67                 Nagluto ng pagkain ang nanay.
                 ‘Mother cooked some food.’                 Nagluto na ng pagkain ang nanay.
                 ‘Mother has cooked some food.’                 Nagluto na ng pagkain ang nanay (noong dumating ako).
                 ‘Mother had cooked some food (when I arrived).’      English also has at least three different tense-aspect formations for reporting events as begun but not
completed. If the event is recurrent, English uses the simple non-past: ‘Mother cooks some food every day’.
On-going events are represented by the non-past progressive or the past progressive: ‘Mother is cooking
some food’; ‘Mother was cooking some food’. All three of these formations correspond to the Tagalog
imperfective aspect:                 Nagluluto ng pagkain ang nanay araw-araw.
                 ‘Mother cooks some food every day.”","[75, 76, 77]"

§3.23.        Ng phrases of specification.
      Several types of expanded nominal constructions that consist of or include a noun followed by ang
phrase are presented in other sections of this text. Among these constructions are: constructions in which
an object ng phrase follows a derived noun with a verbal base: e.g., /tiramnan ng pera ‘place for borrowing
money’ (cf. §3.7, derived noun classes (1), (12), (1S}H{17)); constructions in which ang phrase expresses a
specific selection after an expression of measure, amount, ctc., or after a limiter, e.g., isang salop ng bigas
‘one ganta of the rice, Kalahati ng mansanas ‘half of the apples* (cf. §§3.17 and 3.22); and possessive
modification constructions: ¢.g., buntot ng aso ‘dog's tail’ (§3.20). The present section is concerned with
certain other expanded nominal constructions of the shape noun + 2g + noun, constructions such as:                   buwan ng Agosto                       ‘month of August’
                   grupo ng babae                        ‘group of women’
                   mina ng karbon                        ‘coal mine’
                   sakit ng ulo                          ‘headache’The ng phrases that occur in these constructions serve to specify the referent of the preceding noun, and
may be called PHRASES OF SPECIFICATION.
     Constructions that include mg phrases of specification may be divided into a number of classes on the
basis of the kind of specification expressed by the mg phrase. Among the morse productive of these classes
are APPELLATIVE            CONSTRUCTIONS,            COMPONENTIAL     CONSTRUCTIONS,      and   CONTENTIVE
CONSTRUCTIONS
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                             149
      Some examples of appellative constructions are:               araw ng Lunes                                 ‘Monday’
               ‘day’  ‘Monday’               Bundok ng Banahaw                             ‘Mount Banahaw’
               ‘mountain’  ‘Banahaw’               lalawigan ng Batangas                         ‘province of Batangas’
               ‘province’   ‘Batangas’               Look ng Maynila                               ‘Manila Bay’
               ‘bay’ ‘Manila’               siyudad ng Maynila                            ‘city of Manila’
               ‘city’   ‘Manila’      In these constructions. the ng phrase specifies the name of a period of time, geographic phenomenon,
or political division designated by the preceding noun. When the first noun represents a geographic
phenomenon, there is in some cases alternation between the appellative construction and a nominal
compound (cf. §3.8); in other cases only an appellative construction may be used, and in still others, only a
compound. For example, the names of mountains usually show alternation (Bundok ng Banahaw or
Bundok-Banahaw ‘Mount Banahaw’), while the names of bays allow only an appellative construction (Look
ng Maynila ‘Manila Bay’) and the names of rivers only a compound (/log-Pasig ‘(the) Pasig River’).
      Examples of componential noun-plus-g-phrase constructions are:               balasa ng baraha                             ‘deck of cards’
               ‘deck’    ‘card’               katipunan ng kuwento                          ‘collection of stories’
               ‘collection’   ‘story’               kawan ng isda                                 ‘school of fish’
               ‘group’ ‘fish’               koponan ng manlalaro                          ‘team of players”
               ‘team’  ‘player’               grupo ng babae                                ‘group of women’
               ‘group’  ‘woman’               hanay ng tao                                  ‘line of people’
               ‘line’   ‘person’In these constructions, the ng phrase specifics the units of which the collection or group designated by the
first noun is composed.
       Examples of contentive noun-plus+tg-phrase constructions are:               bote ng pomada                               *pomade bottle’
               ‘bottle’  ‘pomade’               bukid ng palay                               ‘tice field’

                lata ng serbesa                                “beer can’
                ‘can’    ‘beer’                mina ng karbon                                 ‘coal mine’
                ‘mine’       ‘coal’      In these constructions, the ng phrase specifies what the receptacle or place designated by the first
noun is meant to contain. (As was noted in §3.17, a complex modification construction is normally used to
designate what a receptacle — regardless of its original purpose — actually contains:       thus: isang latang
serbesa ‘a can of beer’ vs. lata ng serbesa ‘(a) beer can’.)
       In addition to appellative, componential, and contentive constructions, mg phrases of specification
occur in a variety of other constructions. Most of these constructions, like those already presented, are
translated either by noun-of-noun constructions or by nominal compounds in English. Some examples are:                banda ng musika                                ‘band’
                ‘band’       ‘music’                klase ng Ingles                                ‘English class’

                ‘year’      ‘birth’§3.24.    Nominalized adjectivals and verbals.
       In the analysis of the structure of Tagalog basic sentences presented in Chapter 2, a severely limited
distribution is assigned to adjectivals and verbals. While nominals are described as occurring in a variety of
positions in basic sentences, adjectivals and verbals are described as occurring in predicate position only.
This restriction upon the distribution of adjectivals and verbals in basic sentences is, however, largely a
matter of analytic and expository convenience; for, as noted in §2.2, Tagalog adjectivals and verbals may
actually occupy most of the same sentence positions as unmarked nouns.
       In a derived sentence, then, an adjectival or verbal may occupy virtually any sentence position that, in
a basic sentence, is occupied exclusively by an unmarked noun: e.g., topic position after ang, complement
position after ng or sa. Similarly, an adjectival or verbal may replace an unmarked noun in most of the
derived constructions — e.g., the ng-possessive construction (§3.19) — which are introduced as involving
nominals only. An adjectival or verbal used as something other than an unmarked predicate or a
modifier — modifiers are derived from predicates, as explained in §3.11 ~ is said to be NOMINALIZED, or
aNOMINALIZATION
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                                         151      Tagalog adjectivals and verbals undergo no change of form when they are nominalized. Their English
equivalents, on the other hand, usually involve the addition of the pronoun ‘one(s)’, or of *one(s)’ and a
relative pronoun, to the adjectival or verbal itself. Thus:                                    bago.

§3.7.     Derived noun formations.
        A DERIVED    NOUN       is a noun that includes at least one NOMINAL         AFFIX and        aNOMINAL BASE.
For practical purposes, a nominal affix may be defined as a meaningful element that characteristically
occurs as part of a noun and never occurs independently as a distinct word. Nominal affixes are either
PREFIXES      of SUFFIXES, according to whether they precede or follow the nominal base.                 A nominal base
is a meaningful element within a derived noun that may also occur independently (¢.g., as a noun or an
adjective) and/or as the base of a non-nominal word (e.g., as a verb base).
        The inventory of classes of derived noun formations presented in this section is not intended to be
exhaustive.   However,   with    the   exception     of the   GERUNDS,   or verbal   nouns,   which    are reserved   for
separate presentation in §3.26, the inventory includes most of the more productive classes, as well as
certain less productive ones.
       In the inventory, each class is designated by a formula in which the symbol *B’ stands for ‘nominal
base.’ The symbol ‘dup, -’ in a formula stands for a prefix that normally consists of a duplication of the first
consonant and first vowel of the syllable before which it occurs, except that: (1) the vowel of dup,- is
always short, whether the vowel of the syllable it precedes is short or long; (2) the vowel of dup,- is /i/ if
the vowel of the following syllable is /e/, or if the following syllable begins with a consonant cluster whose
second member is fy/; (3) the vowel of dup,- is /u/ if the vowel of the following syllable is /o/, or if the
following syllable begins with a consonant cluster whose second member is /w/. The symbol ‘dup,-’ in a
formula stands for a prefix that normally consists of duplication of the entire base, except that: (1) the
last vowel of dupp- is long if the independent form of the base ends in /h/ or /""/ (the /h/ or /""/ does not
itself occur in dupg-): otherwise it is short; (2) all other vowels of dupg- are short. Affixes other than
dup,- and dupp- are represented in the formulas by their conventional spelling, except that prefixes are
followed and suffixes preceded by a hyphen. In cases where there are two classes identical in composition
but unrelated in meaning, the classes are listed separately without comment.
      For each class of formations listed, the class meaning(s), expressed as a function of the meanings of
the bases, and examples with translations, are presented. Each example is followed by a parenthetic citation

unless otherwise noted.
       Many of the listings include a discussion of pronunciation. In the absence of any comment to the
contrary, it is to be understood that there is no inherent length in the affix(es), and that the bases show no
phonemic change from their CITATION            FORMS. (The citation form of a base is the form that it has in its
independent     occurrence — or, in a few cases, in its occurrence           in a related      formation.) Such general
phenomena of Tagalog phonology as the interchange of /d/ and /r/, ef and /i/, or /of and /uf (cf.§ §1.20.,
1.7, and 1.10) or the loss of /h/ and /’/ before a consonant (cf. § § 1.14 and 1.17) are not commented upon.","[107, 108]"

               ‘The woman has a book..’)       When the nominal in a locative adjective phrase is a deictic pronoun, the phrase is equivalent to ‘here’
or ‘in/at this place’ or to ‘there’ or ‘in/at that place’. (The four categories of deictics show the same meaning
differences in locative phrases that they show elsewhere — cf. §3.4). Thus:               Narito si Juan.
                                     here.’
               ‘Juan is
                                     infat this place.’               Naroon si Juan.
                                 { there.’
               ‘Juan is
                                 ( in/at that place.’      A locative deictic is often used as the first clement (and head) of a modification construction, in
which case it is followed by asa phrase. (As was noted in §3.12, the sa form of a deictic, when it occurs as
the head of a modification construction, is followed by a sa phrase, rather than by a linker-plus-modifier
construction.) For example:               Narito sa Maynila si Juan.
               ‘Juan is here in Manila.”",[267]

§4.2.     Unaffixed adjectives.
        Most of the commonest adjectives of Tagalog are either              UNAFFIXED       ADJECTIVES      or mia-
ADJECTIVES. Unaffixed adjectives, as the labe] suggests, include no prefixes or suffixes in their formation.
They fall into two major subclasses. The first of these subclasses consists of unaffixed adjectives that lack
inherently long vowels (cf. §1.12), and that are related to nouns and/or verb bases with an inherently long
vowel in the penultimate syllable. (Except for vowel length, the adjectives and the nouns or verb bases are
identical.) Some examples are:                           Adjective                                        Noun and/or Verb Base

English: ayos ‘arranged’, bali ‘fractured’, basag ‘broken’, etc.)
       All other unaffixcd adjectives belong to the second of the major subclasses. The members of this
subclass may or may not include an inherently long vowel. Those that lack inherent length are, in any case,
not related to nouns and/or verb bases with inherent length. Some examples of adjectives in the second
major subclass are:                 banal                        ‘virtuous’                 pisa               ‘crushed’
                 berde                        ‘green’                    pula               ‘red’
                 bihira                       ‘uncommon’                 puti               ‘white*
                 duwag                        ‘cowardly’                 yayat              ‘emaciated’
                 hilaw                        ‘raw’                      putot              “bent”
                 hinog                        ‘ripe’                    sariwa              ‘fresh’
                 mahal                        “expensive”               suwail              ‘insolent’
                 mura                         ‘cheap’                   tama                ‘correct’
                 payat                        “thin’                    tahimik             ‘quiet’
                 pipi                         ‘dumb’                     tamad              ‘lazy’         There are certain types of formations and constructions in which members of this second subclass of
unaffixed adjectives occur while members of the first subclass do not. For example, virtually all members of
the second subclass occur in intensive formations with napeka- (cf. §4.12), and many members of this class
occur in exclamations after kay ($4.24), but no members of the first subclass so occur. Thus there are
formations like napakabanal ‘very virtuous’, napakaberde ‘very green’ and constructions like kay banal ‘how
virtuous’, Kay berde ‘how green’ (banal and berde belong to the second subclass of unaffixed adjectives),
but there is no *napakaayos, *napakabali, or *kay ayos, *kay bali (ayos and bali belong to the first
subclass).
    Within the second subclass, there is a small group of unaffixed adjectives that are
GENDER-MARKED. These adjectives, all of which are borrowed from Spanish, occur in two different
forms:     one ending      in -o /oh/, the other ending in -a /ah/. The forms ending in -a are used when the
adjectives refer to female human beings or female animals; the forms ending in -o are used in all other
cases: i.e., when the adjectives refer to male human beings or male animals, to groups including individuals
of both sexes, to inanimate objects, to abstractions, etc. Thus:
                 Komika si Linda.                           ‘Linda is funny.”                                        si Fred.                     ‘Fred is

Some other adjectives belonging to the gender-marked subclass are:                ambisyoso/-a                ‘ambitious’                   nerbyoso/-a                  ‘nervous.
                delikado/-a                 ‘delicate’                    relihyoso/-a                 ‘religious’
                guwapo/-a                   ‘handsome’                    romantiko/-a                 ‘romantic’
                loko/-a                     ‘crazy’                       simpatiko/-a                 ‘pleasing’
                    modemo/-a               ‘modern’                      tonto/-a                     ‘stupid’(cf. also §3.6 for a discussion of gender-marked nouns.)
§4.3. Ma- adjectives.
      Ma-adjectives consist of the prefix ma- (/ma/) and a ma-adjective base. Most ma-adjective bases also
occur independently, either as nouns or as unaffixed adjectives; a few ma-adjective bases do not occur
independently.
       ma-adjective bases that occur independently as nouns may be divided into two subclasses, according
to whether the nouns designate abstract qualities or concrete objects. These two subclasses of bases differ in
distribution in the following way: bases that designate abstract qualities generally also occur in intensive
formations after napaka- (cf. §4.11), in -am- verbs of ‘becoming’ (§5.6, class G) and in exclamations after
ang or kay (§4.24); but bases that designate concrete objects do not generally occur in these formations
and constructions. Thus the base of mabigat ‘heavy’ (cf. bigat ‘weight’) also occurs in napakabigat ‘very
heavy’, bumigat ‘become heavy’ and ang/kay bigat ‘how heavy’; but the base of mabundok ‘mountainous’
(cf. bundok ‘mountain’) does not occur in similar formations and constructions: there is no
*napakabundok,     *bumundok, or *ang/kay bundok. (The distribution of ma-adjective bases that occur
independently as unaffixed adjectives and of ma-adjective bases that do not occur independently generally
resembles that of the bases that designate abstract qualities.)
      The meaning expressed by a ma-adjective whose base is a noun is, generally:                          having an abundance of
what the base designates. This is the case whether the base itself designates an abstract quality or a concrete
object.
        In the following list of ma-adjectives whose bases function as nouns in their independent occurrences,
the   nouns   are     cited    and   translated      in   parentheses   after   the   adjectives.      (There     are   five   adjectives
listed — mabundok, mabuto, madagta, malangis, and matao — whose bases designate concrete objects; the
other bases designate abstract qualities.)                    mabigat                 ‘heavy’                                   (bigat ‘weight’)

subclasses, according to whether the ma- adjective does or does not have the same meaning as the unaffixed
adjective. Examples of ma- adjectives that are more or less identical in meaning with their bases are:                 maaliwalas                        ‘bright’                       (aliwalas ‘bright’)

                 mapayapa                          ‘peaceful’                     (payapa ‘peaceful’)
                 masagana                          ‘prosperous’                   (sagana ‘prosperous’)

the mma- adjective generally designates the transitory and/or non-inherent possession of a quality, the
unaffixed adjective the permanent and/or inherent possession of the quality. This is the case with many
adjectives designating color or shape. Compare the meanings of the mma- adjectives and unaffixed adjectives
in the following pairs of sentences:                 Maputi ang bulaklak.
                 ‘The flower is white (e.g., it has faded).’                 Puti ang bulaklak.
                 ‘The flower is (naturally) white.’                 Madilaw ang buhok niya.
                 ‘Her hair is yellow (¢.g., bleached).’                 Dilaw ang buhok niya.
                 ‘Her hair is (naturally) yellow.’                 Mabilog ang buwan.

      Like English, Tagalog distinguishes between CARDINAL NUMBERS (i.e., numbers used in counting
or in expressing quantity: cf. English ‘one’, two’, etc.) and ORDINAL NUMBERS (i.¢., numbers used in
expressing   order     or   rank:   cf.   English      ‘first’, ‘second’, etc.). The      Tagalog cardinal    numbers   may,   for
descriptive purposes, be divided into two classes: SIMPLE and COMPLEX, Simple numbers consist of a
single meaningful element, complex numbers of more than one meaningful element. The simple cardinal
numbers of Tagalog are:                isa                          ‘one’                                 lima                ‘five’
                dalawa                       ‘two*                                 anim                ‘six’
                tatlo                        ‘three*                               pito                ‘seven’
                apat                         ‘four’                                walo                 ‘eight’
                                                         siyam            ‘nine’All the complex numbers include at least one of the simple numbers and at least one other meaningful
clement. The other meaningful elements that commonly occur in complex numbers are:                pu                           ‘times ten’
                labi                         ‘ten plus’
                daan                         ‘times one hundred’
                libo                         ‘times one thousand’
                milyon                       ‘times one million’Multiples of ten are formed by adding the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11) plus pu, daan, libo, or milyon to one of
the simple numbers. (The -ng form of the linker is always manifested as /m/ before pu, and this
pronunciation is reflected in the conventional spelling. The -ng form of the linker is often manifested as /n/
before daan and libo and as /m/ before milyon, but the -ng spelling — except in the case of the variant
forms for ‘one hundred’ and ‘one thousand’, sandaan and sanlibo — is retained. The first syllable of isa ‘one’
is dropped in sampu ‘ten’( <— isa + linker + pu), and in sandaan and sanlibo. Daan has a variant form, raar,
which is a normal after the na form of the linker.) Examples are:                sampu                        ‘ten*                             limampu              ‘fifty’
                dalawampu                    “twenty”                          animnapu             ‘sixty’
                tatlumpu                     ‘thirty’                           pitumpu             “seventy”
                apatnapu                     ‘forty’                           walumpu              ‘eighty’
                                                  siyamnapu                 ‘ninety*                isang daan (sandaan)                                    ‘one hundred’
                dalawang daan                                           ‘two hundred’

                apat na raan                                            ‘four hundred’
                isang libo (sanlibo)                                    ‘one thousand’
                dalawang libo                                           ‘two thousand’                isang milyon                                            ‘one million’
                dalawang milyon                                         ‘two million’(Three additional elements ~ laksa ‘times ten thousand’, yuta ‘times one hundsed thousand’, and angaw
‘times one million’ — are used by some Tagalog speakers in forming numbers representing multiples of ten.
When used, these elements, like pu, etc., occur after one of the simple numbers plus the linker na/-ng: isang
laksa ‘ten thousand’, isang yuta ‘one hundred                    thousand’, isang angaw ‘one million’. These elements are,
however, unfamiliar to perhaps the majority of educated Manila speakers, who would express ‘ten
thousand’ as sampung libo, ‘one hundred thousand’ as isang daang libo, and ‘one million’ as isang milyon.)
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                           _ 201       Numbers from eleven to nineteen are formed by adding the linker -ng plus one of the simple numbers
to labi. (The linker is manifested as /m/, /n/, or /n/ according to whether the first consonant of the
following simple number is bilabial, dental/alveolar, or velar/glottal. The variation is reflected in tho
conventional spelling.) Thus:               labing-isa           ‘eleven’                       labinlima            ‘fifteen’
               labindalawa          ‘twelve’                       labing-anim          ‘sixteen’
               labintatlo           ‘thirteen’                     labimpito            “seventeen’
               labing-apat          ‘fourteen’                     labingwalo           ‘eighteen’
                                           labinsiyam         ‘ninteen’      Other complex numbers are formed with the coordinating conjunction at ‘and’ (cf. §7.19), which
occurs between any number representing a multiple of ten and another number. (As noted in §7.19,at is
optionally cotracted to ‘t /t/ after a word which, in its independent occurrences, ends in {°/, {h/, or /n/. The
final consonant of the preceding word is simultaneously dropped. The contracted form of a¢ is normal after
the elements pu, daan and libo. Thus:               pu /pu’/ + at                     ~             pu't /put/
               daan /da’an/ + at                 >             daa’t /da’at/
               libo /li‘boh/ + at                >             libo't /li‘but/.)Some examples are:               dalawampu’t isa                                 *twenty-one’
               tatlumpu’t dalawa                               ‘thirty-two’
               apat na raa’t sampu                             ‘four hundred ten’

               ‘nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine’               isang milyon at limang daang libo.
               ‘one million five hundred thousand’      There is only one common        expression for a fraction:   Kalahati ‘(a) half — cf. §3.22. Kalahati may
occur without other numbers, or it may be joined by the conjunction at (or its contracted form ‘t) toa
preceding cardinal number, as in isa’t kalahati ‘one and a half’. (Arithmetic is taught in English in the
Philippines; hence no extensive Tagalog vocabulary for fractions has developed.)
       Tagalog has two common ways of expressing ‘about’ or ‘approximately’ with cardinal numbers. One
is the particle mga {manah/, which immediately precedes the number. (This particle is homonymous with
the pluralizing particle mga discussed in § §3.9 and 4.11.) The other is the expression hi(um iigit-Kumulang
(literally, ‘exceed fall-short’, i.e., ‘more or less’), which also precedes the number, but is separated from it
by the linker na/-ng (as well as, optionally, by any enclitic particles that may be present — cf. §6.6). Some
examples of the use of mga and h(um figit-kumulang with cardinal numbers are:                         mga
               May                                       dalawampung tao doon noong Biyernes.

               ‘There are about two hundred of them now.”
               (Literally: ‘They are now about two hundred.’)
      Tagalog has two sets of ordinal numbers, one formed by prefixing ika — to the cardinal numbers, the
other formed by prefixing pang- to the cardinal numbers. In both sets the first three ordinal numbers are
irregular. (In the ika- set, the expected but non-occurring form for ‘first’, *ikaisa, is replaced by the Spanish
loan-word una which in turn serves as the base of the first member of the pang- set, panguna. Sce the list
below for the other irregular formations.) Peng- shows the variant forms pam-, pan-, and pang-, according to
whether the first consonant of the cardinal number is bilabial, dental/alveolar, or velar/glottal. Examples of
the ordinal numbers are listed below:

ika- formations are common, the pang- formations relatively rare.
      In addition to the numbers dealt with above, Tagalog uses numbers borrowed from Spanish and
English in certain semantic contexts. The borrowed numbers have, in general, the forms that they have in
the language of origin, but their pronunciation is in many cases slightly modified so as to conform to the
Tagalog phonemic system. For example, Spanish diez ‘ten’ is borrowed as diyes ({dye‘s/~/diye‘s/), and
English three as a Tagalog word is pronounced /trith/. (The sequence diez y in Spanish numbers is
pronounced /disi/- in Tagalog, as in /disisye*tch/ ‘seventcen’ (Spanish diez y siete).) In conventional Tagalog
spelling, Spanish numbers are respelled to reflect their Tagalog pronunciation; English spellings for English
numbers are retained.
       There are some semantic contexts in which a Tagalog speaker has the option of using numbers from
any one of the different sets (i.e., numbers of Spanish, English, or native Tagalog origin), others in which he
may use numbers from either of two of these sets, and still others in which numbers from only one of the
sets may be used. Numbers of Tagalog origin are the most versatile, numbers of English origin the most
restricted in their occurrence — at least in standard formal Tagalog. (In the following presentation of the
uses of numbers in various semantic contexts, English numbers are, in general, discussed in detail only
where theirs usage in Tagalog differs from native English usage.)
      The following are some of the more common semantic contexts in which numbers are used:      (1) ADDRESSES. Spanish and English cardinal numbers are used. the latter only colloquially. The
Spanish numbers are more or less obligatorily preceded by the word numero; the name of the street is
optionally preceded by the word kalye ‘street’ or by daang (daan ‘strect’ plus the linker na/-ng):

pronoun after karamihan: ‘most of them’ is only karamiltan sa kanila. Mass nouns do not occur in phrases

§1.4. Phonetic and phonemic notation.
       Since conventional Tagalog spelling (cf. §1.30) does not reflect the pronunciation of the language
with perfect accuracy or consistency, it is necessary to make use of a special system of notation for
representing Tagalog speech sounds and phonemes. For the same reason (and to a much greater degree), a
special notation is necessary for those speech sounds and phonemes of English with which the sounds of
Tagalog can profitably be compared.
       An accurate and consistent written representation of speech sounds, in which cach symbol represents
one and only one sound, is called a PHONETIC NOTATION. In this book all phonetic notations appear
between square brackets: e.g., [bu:x/'d].
      An accurate and consistent written representation of phonemes, in which each symbol represents one
and only one phoneme, is called a PHONEMIC NOTATION, In this book all phonemic notations appear
between slant lines: e.g., /bu-kid/.
      Citations in conventional spelling are italicized, and       English   translations of Tagalog words and
utterances appear between single quotes: ¢.g., bukid ‘farm’.
      The following list shows the twenty-three symbols used in this book to represent the vowel and
consonant phonemes of Tagalog:
                            labdefghikimnnoprsttuwy
       As can be scen, all but three of the symbols on the list are also used as letters in conventional written
English (although the Tagalog sounds represented by the symbols are in some cases quite different from the
English sounds usually represented by the letters). The three symbols not used as letters in written English
are /n//t$/, and /*/, The sounds represented by these symbols are discussed in §§1.16,             1.18, and   1.14
respectively,
      In addition to the above symbols for the phonemes of Tagalog, certain other symbols are used for the
phonemes of English. and for allophones of the Tagalog phonemes. The meaning of these symbols is
explained as the symbols are introduced.",[14]

                       palantsahin       Pronunciation:
       (a) Bases with long penultimate vowels:
       If the base has two syllables, the derived noun shows one of two patterns:                        (1) length on both the
penultimate and final base vowels; (2) length on neither.
                 (1)      Pa:wi:tin/                      (/'a:wit/)

                             lu:tu:’in/Speakers may differ as to which of these two patterns they use for a given derived noun, and in some cases
a single speaker may use the two patterns as free alternates. For bases of three or more syllables, see (b),
immediately below.
(b) Bases with no long vowels:
       The normal vowel-length patterns of disyllabic bases are the same as those for B + -an formations,
classes (1) and (2) above. Bases of three or more syllables have the same vowel-length patterns as in Class
(2) B +-an formations, whether or not the penultimate vowel of the citation form of the base is long.                 /a:la(:)ga:’in/                              (/‘ala:ga’/)

about’ (cf. »ag-alala {ma’alalah/ ‘worry’).
(4) dupg- + B + -an
       Meaning: an imitation of what the base designates.
       Examples:
       bahay-bahayan                             ‘doll house/*house (the game)’                     (bahay ‘house’)

       Pronunciation: The last vowel of the base is always long. All other base vowels are short. These rules
apply regardless of the presence or absence of inherent length in the citation form of the base. Examples
are:

      Meaning:     a person      (occasionally,    a   thing)   reciprocally   associated   with    another;     the   basis   of
association varics with the meaning of the base and may be: (a) a place of residence, occupation, or origin;
(b) a quality: (c) membership in a group; (d) spatial position; (¢) participation in an activity.
       Examples: The examples are arranged according to the classification given under Meaning.)      (a)     kakwarto             ‘roommate’                                               (kuwarto ‘room’)

     Remarks: There are a few irregular formations: ¢.g., Kababayan ‘compatriot’ (bayan ‘country’), in
which a duplicating syllable occurs between the prefix and the base; Xasambahay ‘housemate’ (bahay
‘house’), in which -sam- (probably from isa ‘one’ plus the linker -ng) occurs between the prefix and the
base.
(6) ka- + B+-an
       Meaning: the class (of qualities) or group (of things/people instanced by what the base designates.

                 kaintsikan                  “the Chinese’                       (Intsik ‘(a) Chinese’)

       Pronunciation: If the penultimate vowel of the citation form of the base is long, there is normally a
shift of length to the last base vowel in the derived noun:

the penultimate base vowel is or is not syllable-final:                    /kaba:na:lan/                          (/banal/)

                    /kata:ma:ran{                          (/tamad/)       There are many derived nouns that are pronounced according to the first of these patterns by some
speakers, according to the second by others. And there are also many that show alternation between the
two patterns in the speech of a single speaker. It is probably the case, however, that the first pattern is the
more common.
     Remarks:         Virtually any unaffixed adjective or sa-adjective base (cf. §§4.2 and 4.3) may occur in
this formation. (In the case of ma-adjective bases — e.g., kapal, lungkot, tapang— there is usually little
difference in meaning between the base itself and the derived noun.) The occurrence or non-occurrence of
bases of other types is not susceptible to generalization. There is, for example, no *kahapunan (cp. Hapon
*(a) Japanese’) paralleling kaintsikan.
       There   is at least one       irregular   formation:   katotohanan   /katotoha:nan/   ‘truth’ (cf.   totoo {toto oh/
“true’).
(7) mag- + B
         Meaning:     two relatives, one of whom         bears to the other the relation designated by the base. (The
selation is reciprocal when the base designates a relative of the same generation.)
       Examples:                    mag-ama                      ‘father and child’                (ama ‘father’)

homophonous verbal prefix (cf. §5.2, Subsection (12)), certain assimilatory changes occur. Base-initial
/p,t.s.k/ are regularly replaced by their homorganic-nasal counterparts: /p/>/m/, /t,s/>/n/, /k/>-/.
Basc-initial /b,'/ are in some cases replaced by nasals, in others not. When the replacement occurs, /b/>/m/,
Ulefnf. (A nasal that replaces /p,ts,k,b,""/ is treated as the basc-initial consonant in duplication.) The final
{nl of the prefix is dropped before a nasal consonant, and is replaced by /m/ before /b/, by /n/ before /d,l/.
These changes, most of which are illustrated in the examples above, may be summarized as follows:

action to be performed, and frequently followed by asa phrase expressing the performer:              e.g., -                 Paluto ni Pedro sa nanay ang bibingka.
                 ‘The bibingka is what Pedro asked Mother to cook?”
                 lyon ba ang pagawa mo sa sapatero?
                 ‘Is that what you’re having the shoemaker make?’      The pa- that occurs in this formation is related to the pa- that occurs in indirect-action verbs (cf.
§5.12).

      Examples: (Citations in parentheses are the basic forms of the related verbs.)               tagapamili                 ‘shopper’                               (mamili ‘shop’)
               tagapamintuho              *(delegated) wooer’                     (mamintuho ‘woo’)
               tagapanghiram              ‘borrower’                              (manghiram ‘borrow’)
               tagapangahoy               ‘wood-gatherer’                         (mangahoy ‘gather wood’)
               tagapangisda               “fisherman”                             (mangisda ‘fish’)      Pronunciation:    Any assimilatory changes evidenced in the related mang- verb (cf. §5.2, Subsection
(12)) are also evidenced in the derived noun.
       Remarks: Derived nouns in this class may take the same ng- phrase object complements as do the
related verbs formed with the same base: e.g.,               tagapamili ng damit              (cf.       mamiling damit
               ‘clothing shopper’                          ‘shop for clothing’)               tagapanghiram ng pera            (cf.       manghiram ng pera
               ‘money borrower’                            ‘borrow money’)
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                                107§3.8.      Nominal compounds.
       A COMPOUND may be defined, for practical purposes. as a word composed of two potentially
distinct words; a NOMINAL COMPOUND, as a compound that functions as a nominal. Tagalog nominal
compounds differ from the derived noun formations dealt with in §3.7 in several ways. In the tirst place,
both the components of nominal compounds are capable of occurring independently, as distinct words,
while at least one component of a derived noun is a prefix or a suffix that occurs only in complex
formations. Thus, while both the components of the nominal compound bagoong-Balayan ‘pickled fish
from Balayan’ (bagoong ‘pickled fish’, Balayan ‘Balayan’) may occur as independent words, only the second
component of the derived noun faga-Balayan ‘person from Balayan’ may do so. Nominal compounds also
differ from derived nouns in that they involve the device of LINKING.         Linking is the connecting of the
elements of a word or construction by means of a special connecting clement, or LINKER. The linker has
as its sole function the indication of a relation between the elements it connects, and has no meaning apart
from the indication of this relation.
       Linking is a characteristic device of Tagalog grammar, and occurs in a number of constructions apart
from compounds. Tagalog has two important linkers (besides coordinating conjunctions — cf. § §3.10 and
7.19), which may be called the linker -ng and the linker na/-ng. The characteristics of the linker na/-ng are
presented in detail in §3.11. The linker -ng, which is the only linker that occurs in compounds has one
overt form and one ZERO FORM: i.e., a form without phonemic representation. The overt form of the
linker occurs if the first of the two elements it connects ends (in its independent form) with one of the
three consonants /h/, /’/, or /nj. In this case the linker consists of the replacement of the final consonant by
{n] (represented by -ng in conventional spelling). Note the following examples of nominal compounds
whose first elements, in their independent forms, end in /h/, /°/, and /nf:        mata                 +-ng     +           lawin                       matang-lawin
        /matah/                                   /la:win}                    /matanla:win/
        ‘eye(s)’                                  ‘hawk’                      (‘eyes like a hawk’s’)
                                                                              ‘keen eyes’
        nguso                + -ng    +           baboy                       ngusong-baboy
        {nu:so’}                                  {ba:boy/                    /nu:sunba:boy/
        ‘upper lip’                               ‘pig’                       (‘upper lip like a pig’s’)
                                                                              ‘protruding upper lip’        ngipin               + -ng    +           aso                         ngiping-aso
        {ni:pin{                                  [a:soh{                     {nipin’a:soh}
        ‘tooth/tecth’                             ‘dog’                       (‘teeth like a dog’s’)
                                                                              ‘sharp tecth’       The zero form of the linker -ng occurs if the fisst linked element ends in any consonant other than
fh/, ['/, or {nf. In effect, the resultant formation consists merely of the two linked elements in their
independent forms. But a zero form of a linker — rather than the absence of a linker — is posited because of
the otherwise perfect parallelism with formations involving the replacement of /hj, /""/, or /n/ by /n/. Thus,
for example, silid-kainan ‘dining room’ and mesang-kainan ‘dining table’ are obviously similar compound
formations, although the first (whose components are silid {silid/ ‘room’ and kainan /ka’inanf ‘eating place’)
involves no overt linker, while the second (whose components are mesa /me:sah/ ‘table’ and Kainan) does.
       Some other examples of compounds involving the zero form of the linker -rg are:
        isip                 + -ng    +           lamok                       isip-lamok

      ‘walk’                                        “turtle”                       (‘walk like a turtle’s’)
                                                                                   ‘slow walk’      Just as nominal compounds differ in several ways from derived nouns, so also do they differ in several
ways from the modification constructions dealt with in § §3.11, ff. One of these ways is that modification
constructions involve the linker na/-ng, rather than the linker -ng. As is explained in §3.11, the linker
naf-ng has the form /naf (spelled na) after a consonant other than /h/, /'/, or /n/. Therefore, when the first
element of a modification construction ends in a consonant other than /h/, /°/, or /n/, there is an overt
difference between it and an otherwise identical nominal compound. Compare, for example, the
modification construction anak na mayaman ‘rich child’ and the nominal compound anak-mayaman ‘person
born to wealth’. The components of the modification construction and those of the compound — anak
‘child’ and mayaman ‘rich’ — are the same but the resultant formations are differentiated by the presence of
na in the first, its absence in the second.
      When      the first element of a modification construction ends, in its independent form, in /h/, {°/, or
{n/, there is no overt difference between the modification construction and a compound with the same
components. For the linker na/-ng and the linker -ug both have the same phonemic realization in such
cases: viz., the replacement of the final consonant by /n/. Thus the modification construction barong
pamparti ‘dress wom at a party’ and the nominal compound barong-pamparti ‘party dress’ are
homophonous. (The elements in both cases are barv /ba:ro / ‘dress’ and pamparti {pampa:rtih/ ‘used/worn
at a party’.
      Nominal compounds, then, are not always distinguishable from modification constructions on the
basis of form. There are, however. a number of other ways in which the two may be distinguished. For
example, the elements of a modification construction may be separated from one another by certain
structures —¢.g., a possessive ng pronoun (cf. §3.20)— while those of a nominal compound are
inseparable. Thus: baro mong panparti ‘your dress worn at a party’, but barong-parmparti mo ‘your party
dress’. Also, the order of elements within nominal compounds is fixed, while that in modification
constructions is, in general, reversible. Thus the modification construction barong pamparti is matched by a
construction of identical meaning but reversed word order, pamparting baro dress worn at a party’; but
there is no nominal compound *panparting-baro.
      Another,      and   very    important,   difference      between   nominal    compounds       and   modification
constructions lies in the semantic relation that obtains between the two linked elements, and the semantic
relation between these elements and the resultant formation. The semantic relation that obtains between
elements linked in a simple modification construction (i-e., a two-component modification construction) is
essentially the same for all such constructions. This is because, as is explained in §3.11, one of the
components of a simple modification construction always corresponds to the predicate of a basic sentence
and the other to its topic. And, since the relation between the predicate and the topic is always essentially
an equational one (cf. §2.2), so is the relation between the elements of the simple modification
construction. Thus in a modification construction like anak na mayaman (or mayamang anak) ‘rich child’
mayaiman ‘tich’ is equated or identified with anak ‘child’ just as it is in the corresponding basic sentence
Mayaman ang anak ‘The child is sich’.
      The elements of a nominal compound, on the other hand, while they in some cases stand in an
equational relation to one another, may also stand in one of a number of other kinds of semantic relations.
Thus the semantic relation implicit in the compound anak-mayaman ‘person born to wealth’ is a possessive
one (‘child of the rich’), as is that in the compound matang-lawin ‘keen eyes’ (‘eyes like a hawk’s’); the
semantic relation implicit in the compound fubig-ulan ‘rain water’ is that of object to source (‘water (tubig)
from rain (ulan)’), as is that in sukang iloko ‘vinegar (ska) from the Ilocos (Moko)’; etc. (A fuller treatment
of the semantic relations that obtain between the elements of nominal compounds is presented on the
following page.)
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                                            109      The semantic relation of the elements of compounds to the compounds themselves also shows a wider
range than does the selation of the elements of modification constructions to the constructions. The
meaning of a modification construction can always be inferred from that of its elements. Thus the meaning
of the modification construction bahay na malaki ‘big house’ is directly inferable from the meanings of
bahay    ‘house’ and mulaki           ‘big’
                                        — given, of course, the equational            meaning      implicit in modification
constructions       in general.     In the case of nominal        compounds,   on   the other hand, the meaning of the
compound may or may not be inferable from the meanings of the clements, even when the semantic
relation between the elements (which, as noted above, may vary) is known. Thus while the meaning of
bahay-pukyutan ‘beehive’ can be inferred from the meaning of its elements (bahay ‘house’, pukyutan
‘honeybee’) once it is known that there is a possessive relation between the clements, the meanings of
certain other compounds involving a possessive relation cannot be inferred from the meaning of the
clements. For example, busgang-araw ‘prickly heat’ probably reflects a possessive relation between buiga
‘fruit’ and araw ‘sun’ (‘fruit of the sun’), but the meaning of the compound is not inferable from the
meanings of the elements plus the meaning of possession. And even in such a case as matang-lawin, the
meaning of the compound cannot be directly inferred from the meaning of the elements plus the meaning
of possession, for the compound does not mean ‘hawk’s eyes’ (which would be expressed by the possessive
construction mata ng lavin — cf. §3.20), but, rather, ‘eyes dike a hawk’s’ or ‘keen eyes’.
      Some of the more productive classes of nominal compounds in Tagalog are illustrated below. The
basis of classification is the semantic relation that probably obtains between the elements of the
compounds. (No attempt is made to subdivide the classes according to the semantic relations of the
elements of the compounds to the compounds themselves, but since the meanings of the elements as well as
of the compounds are given, the range of such relations within each class may to some extent be inferred
from the examples listed.) Each listed compound is followed by a gloss of its elements and then by a
translation.
        (1) Descriptive: The second element of the compound describes or specifies the first. In some cases
the first clement represents a genus, the second a species; in others, the second element represents the
material of which the first is composed; in others, an equational relationship obtains.

      tubig-ulan              (tubig ‘water,’ ulan ‘rain’)                      ‘rain water’      One general fact about the order of elements within Tagalog nominal compounds in relation to that
within English nominal compounds emerges from the above examples: viz., that in cases where the two
languages have compounds with similar elements and similar meanings, the order of elements within the
Tagalog compounds is usually the reverse of that in the English compounds. Thus: punong-mangga (puno
‘tree’, mangga ‘mango’) versus ‘mango tree’; pammatid-uhaw (pamatid ‘used for cutting’, haw ‘thirst’) versus
‘thirst-quencher’; bahtay-paaralan (bahay ‘house’, paaralan ‘school’) versus ‘schoolhouse’; bahay-pukyutan
(bahay ‘house’, pukyutan ‘honeybee’) versus ‘beehive’; tubig-ulan (tubig ‘water’, ulan ‘rain’) versus ‘rain
water’.
       (In addition to nominal compounds, Tagalog also has certain compound adjectives and compound
verb bases. These compounds resemble nominal compounds both in their formation, which involves the
linker -ng, and in the kinds of semantic relations that obtain between their elements. Thus a possessive

                 a                    8            ®                      e          <       e         .          ’lasang-isda (lasa ‘taste’, isda ‘fish’) ‘tasting of fish’, an object relation in the bases of such verbs as
magbigay-galang (bigay ‘giving’, galang ‘respect’) ‘show respect’ or magbangong-puri (bangon ‘raise’, puri
‘honos’) ‘redeem one’s honor’, etc. Because of the similarity of compound adjectives and compound verb
bases to nominal compounds, no further treatment of the adjectives and verbs is included in this text.)
§3.9. Pluralization of nominals.
       Tagalog has devices for pluralizing nouns, deictic, personal, and interrogative pronouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adjective phrases. Thus Tagalog has a wider range of plural formations than does English, in
which only nouns, personal and deictic pronouns, and verbs have distinctive plurals. The number
distinctions of English, however, have a more central role in the language than the number distinctions of
Tagalog. In the first place, obligatory choices between singular and plural formations are common in
English, but rare in Tagalog. In English, for example, a speaker must make a choice between expressing the
plural in the case of most common nouns. If he says te book, he is clearly referring to one object; if he
says the books, to more than one. In Tagalog, on the other hand, although there is a way of explicitly
pluralizing    most     unmarked   nouns,   the        pluralization   of a noun             need   not — and,   in some    cases in fact,
cannot — be formally signaled if the context makes the plural meaning clear. Without context the sentence
Nasa mesa ang libro means ‘The book is on the table’. But the same sentence can be used to mean ‘The
books are on the table’ in a situation where both the speaker and the hearer know that more than one book
is being referred to. (The insertion of the word mga (/manah/) before /ibro would make the plural meaning
explicit — sce below).
      In English there are also certain obligatory number agreements between the subject and the predicate
of a sentence: The man is a lawyer{The men are lawyers. \n Tagalog there is, in general, no obligatory
number agreement between the predicate and the topic. Either the predicate alone, the topic alone, or both
may in most cases be pluralized:                     Mga abogado ang lalaki.
                     Abogado ang mga lalaki.                                  ‘The men are lawyers.’
                     Mga abogado ang mga lalaki.","[108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"
"     Any of the various goal-focus types (object focus, directional focus, benefactive focus, etc. — cf.
§§2.9 and 5.7 through 5.12) may occur in an indefinite may phrase. The meaning of the verb in such a
phrase is essentially the same as its meaning when it occurs as a verbal predicate:     e.g.,               May sinulat ako.                             (cf.   Sinulat ko ang liham.
               ‘I wrote something.”                                “lL wrote the Ietter.’)               May sinulatan ako.                           (cf.   Sinulatan ko si Pedro.
               ‘I wrote to someone.’                               ‘I wrote to Pedro.*)               May isinulat ako (ng liham).                 (cf.   Isinulat ko (ng liham) ang Nanay.
               ‘I wrote (a letter) for someone.”                   ‘I wrote (a letter) for Mother.’)               May pinagsulatan ako.                        (cf.   Pinagsulatan ko ang desk.
               ‘1 wrote (it) somewhere.’                           ‘I wrote (it) on the desk.’)               May ipinangsulat ako.                        (cf.   Ipinangsulat ko ang lapis.
               ‘Il wrote with something.’                          ‘I wrote with the pencil.’)      (Instead of an inflected form of a verb, an indefinite may phrase may include a pseudo-verb — ef.
§4.21 — followed by the linker ng and the basic form of a goal-focus verb. Some examples are:
                               ayaw
                               kailangang

                               wants      An indefinite may phrase may include, in addition to the verb (and its complements other than an
actor-complement), a noun that partially specifies the person, thing, place, etc., to which the verb refers.
This noun may cither precede or follow the verb (or verb phrase). In either case, the linker na/-ng
immediately precedes the second clement. As was mentioned above, the English equivalent of a sentence
whose predicate is an indefinite may phrase introduced by may or mayroon often includes an indefinite
pronoun or adverb. When a specifying noun is present, however, the English equivalent normally includes,
instead of an indefinite pronoun or adverb, an indefinite noun phrase:        that is, a phrase consisting of ‘a/an'
or ‘some’ plus a noun. Thus:                                  istudyanteng dumating

                             ‘He goes somewhere every day.” )      (As was noted in §2.2, the topic of a Tagalog sentence always expresses a meaning of definiteness.
Therefore the predicate-plus-topic structure cannot in most cases express the equivalent of an English
sentence with an indefinite noun phrase as subject. The equivalent of such a sentence is instead commonly
expressed by a sentence with an indefinite may phrase that includes an actor-focus verb and a specifying
noun. Thus, while the English sentences ‘A student came’ and ‘The student came’ are highly similar in
structure,    their        Tagalog     counterparts — Afay        istudyanteng        dumating      and    Dumating     ang   istudyante
respectively — are not.)
       The presence of a specifying                  noun       in an indefinite phrase          introduced      by marami     normally
corresponds to the presence of a phrase consisting of ‘a lot of or ‘lots of plus a noun in English:                           e.g.,                                              trabahong gagawin
                    Maraming                                               si Juan.
                                              gagawing trabaho
                    ‘Juan has a lot of work to do.’                    (cf.     Maraming gagawin si Juan.
                             “Juan has a lot to do.’)      A verb (or verb phrase) and a specifying noun within an indefinite may phrase need not occur in
immediate sequence. They may be separated by an adverb, by the topic of the sentence, etc. (In all cases,
however, whichever element — verb or specifying noun — is second is immediately preceded by the linker
na/-ng.) Thus, there are such sentences as:                                              istudyante kahapong dumating.
                    May
                                     dumating kahapong istudyante.
                    ‘A student came yesterday.""                                              trabaho si Juang gagawin.

                                       gagawin si Juang trabaho.
                    ‘Juan has a lot of work to do.”as well as sentences of the type previously exemplified.
       Existential say phrases, like possessive smay phrases (cf.                         §4.22), normally         consist of may      (or
mmayroon     plus     the     linker   -ng,    smarami   plus     the   linker   -1g)    followed     by    a   noun.   Sentences     with
existential-phrase predicates differ from those with possessive-phrase predicates in the absence of a topic.
The sentence consists either of a may phrase alone or of a may phrase plus one or more adverbials.
      Sentences with existential-phrase predicates introduced by say or mayroon are often equivalent to
English sentences in which initial ‘there’ is followed by some form of ‘be’ plus an indefinite noun
phrase -- e.g., ‘There’s a book on the table’, ‘There was a party yesterday’. (The ‘there’ in the equivalent
English sentences is unstressed. The Tagalog equivalent of sentences with stressed initial ‘there’ — ¢.g.,
‘There’s a bus’ (= ‘There comes a bus’) -- begins with an attention-directing deictic ~ cf. §4.6 — rather than
an existential phrase.) Some examples are:
                May libro sa mesa.
                ‘There's a book on the table.”","[288, 289, 290]"

questions, cf. §7.13.)
§7.7.   Information questions: introduction.
      As was stated in §7.3, an information question is a question to which the expected answer is
information that falls within a semantic— and, to some extent, structural—category indicated by the
questioner. In Tagalog as in English, the category within which the expected information falls is indicated
by the use of one of a relatively small group of INTERROGATIVE WORDS: e.g., kailan ‘when’, nassan
‘where’, sino ‘who.’ The answer to a kailan question, for example, is normally a time adverbial, the answer
‘DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES                                                                      505to a nasaan question a locative adjectival, the answer to a sino question a nominal that represents a human
being.
      From the point of view of grammatical function, as well as that of meaning, the several interrogative
words funtion as interrogative substitutes for the class of structures they normally elicit. Thus Kailan has
grammatical functions similar to those of such time expressions as ngayon ‘today’,sa Lunes ‘next Monday’,
or tuwing Sabado ‘every Saturday’ (cf. §7.8), and may occur as:
               (1)   a pseudo—predicate:       e.g.,
                     Kailan ang miting?
                     ‘When is the meeting?”","[616, 617]"
"
§3.6.    Unmarked nouns.
       An unmarked noun is a nominal of invariant form that may occur without a marker in predicate
position. The unmarked noun class is the largest nominal class of Tagalog. Most of the members of the class
correspond to common            nouns in English:             e.g., bata ‘child’, bukid ‘farm’, buti ‘goodness’. The class also
includes certain nouns that correspond to proper nouns in English: place names, names of events, etc:               Maynila ang bayan ko.
               ‘My home town is Manila.’               Pasko ang paborito kong pista.
               *My favorite holiday is Christmas.’
(Generally, however, unmarked nouns that correspond to proper nouns in English are definitized in
predicate position. Thus, preferably: Ang Maynila ang bayan ko, Ang Pasko ang paborito kong pista. (Cf.
§7.17 for a discussion of the definitized predicate.)
       As was noted in §2.4, an unmarked noun in predicate position usually expresses either an
INDEFINITE or a GENERIC meaning: respectively, ‘a member of the class__’ or ‘the class__’. An
unmarked-noun predicate expressing an indefinite meaning is usually translated by an indefinite article
(‘a/an’ or ‘some’) plus a noun in English:               Bahay
               Mansanas                    ito.
                Kape                                           a house.’
                ‘This is                   an apple.”
                                           some coffee.
%                                                                                                                  CHAPTER3An unmarked-noun predicate expressing a generic meaning is often translated by a noun without an article
in English:                  Mansanas
                                        ang pangunahin nilang ani.
                   Kape                                                     'apple(s).""
                  “Their major crop is
                                                     coffee.”
       In topic position unmarked nouns are preceded by ang. An ang-plus-unmarked-noun topic normally
expresses either a DEFINITE meaning, ‘an identified member of the class    * (corresponding to ‘the’ plus
noun in English) or a generic meaning:                  Matamis ang kendi.
                  ‘The candy
                                                     is sweet.”
                  *Candy       Unmarked nouns serving as actor complements after ng and directional complements after sa may
express either definite or indefinite meanings (cf. § §2.11 and 5.25):                   Ibinigay ng maestra sa bata ang aklat.
                  A                                                               a

                   ‘The                                                           theUnmarked nouns serving as object complements after ng normally express indefinite meanings:                   Bumili ako ng sombrero.
                   “Ll bought a hat.’The kinds of meanings expressed by unmarked nouns in other constructions — e.g., adjectival and adverbial
phrases, possessive modifiers — are dealt with in connection with the constructions themselves, in the
appropriate sections below.
      The unmarked-noun class is divisible into             a number of subclasses. One such subclass is a relatively
small group of GENDER-MARKED nouns borrowed from Spanish. The gender of these nouns is indicated
by the final vowel. Members of the gender-marked subclass with masculine referents all end in-o /oh/: ¢.g.,
biyudo /biyu:doh{ ‘widower’; maestro {ma‘e:stroh{ ‘teacher (masculine)’; members of the subclass with
feminine      referents all end    in -@ (fah/):   e.g., biyuda      {biyu:dah/         ‘widow’, maestra /ma‘e:strah/ ‘teacher
(feminine)’. A good many gender-marked nouns represent occupations:                   kosturcro/-a                                    ‘dressmaker’
                   kusinero/-a                                     ‘cook’

"      (For the use of sarili in reflexive constructions, cf. §3.21.)
§3.21.   Reflexive and intensive nominal constructions.
       The English *-self/selves’ formations (‘myself, ourselves’, etc.) have two different uses: reflexive, as
in ‘I hurt myself, and intensive, as in ‘] went myself or ‘I myself went’. Tagalog uses distinct constructions
to express the reflexive and the intensive.
      The Tagalog counterpart of the English reflexive pronouns is identical in shape with the emphatic
possessive construction discussed in §3.20: viz., a possessive modification construction whose head is sarili
‘self, own’ and whose modifier is either the zg form or the sa form of a personal pronoun. As in the case of
other possessive modification constructions, the ng form follows the head without linking, while the sa
form precedes the head and is joined to it by the linker na-/-ng. Thus:               sarili ko
                                           ‘myself?
               aking sarili      Some examples of the use of reflexive constructions in sentences are:                                           sarili ko.
               Sinaktan ko ang
                                           aking sarili.
               ‘L hurt myself.’

       Manner adverbs do not occur initially in ay inversion, contrastive inversion, or emphatic adverb
inversion, but do occur initially in non-cmphatic adverb inversion, in which case they are linked to what
follows by the linker na/-ng (cf. §7.2, subsection (4)).
      As is noted in §6.7, a nang or linker that introduces a non-initial adverb is dropped when the adverb
occurs in initial position. Some examples are:
               Biglang binuksan ni Fred ang pintuan.
               ‘Fred opened the door suddenly.’
               Gaya ng mga ruwisenyor na kumanta ang mga bata.

§6.11.         Other movable adverbs.
        In addition    to time    adverbs,    locative     adverbs,   and manner        adverbs (cf.   §§6.8, 6.9, and 6.10
respectively), Tagalog has movable adverbs of a number of other kinds. These adverbs are presented below
under    the   following   headings:    (1) adverbs      with   non-initial   sa   phrases;   (2) sa... ng adverbs; (3) nang
measurement adverbs; (4) miscellaneous movable adverbs.
        (1) ADVERBS        WITH NON-INITIALsa PHRASES. Members of this class of adverbs consist of an
introductory word followed by a sa phrase (s@ plus an unmarked noun, nominalization, or sa-form personal
pronoun; kay or kina plus a personal noun; or a sa-form deictic pronoun.) The class includes: (a)
BENEFACTIVE, PURPOSE, and other adverbs introduced by para; (b) CAUSATIVE                                    ADVERBS; (c)
REFERENTIAL ADVERBS; (d) other adverbs with non-initial sa phrases.
      (a) BENEFACTIVE, PURPOSE and other adverbs introduced by para. In both benefactive and
purpose adverbs, the sa phrase is preceded by para. In benefactive adverbs, the nominal within the sa phrase
is usually a noun or pronoun; in purpose adverbs, the nominal within the sa phrase is a gerund (cf. §3.26).
Both types of adverbs are normally translatable by English ‘for’ phrases, and both are similar in form and
meaning to certain adjective phrases (cf. §4.20, subsections (1) to (3)).
      Benefactive adverbs may express either the meaning ‘for the benefit (or use) of ...° or ‘acting in
place of ...°. Thus the sentence:                  Ginawa niya ang trabaho para sa iyo.
                  ‘He did the work for you.”is capable of being interpreted in either of two ways:                ‘He did the work for your benefit’ or ‘He did the
work, acting in your place.’ And the sentence:                  Bibilhin mo ba iyon para sa akin?
                  ‘Will you buy that for me?’may mean either ‘Will you buy that for my use?’ or ‘Will you buy that, acting in my place?’
     The nominal within a bencfactive adverb often corresponds to the topic of a benefactive—focus verb
(cf. §5.7). Some examples are:                  Sumulat ka ng liham para sa skin-|
                  Isulat mo ako ng liham.
                  “Write a letter for me.”","[564, 565]"
"(Some speakers allow the replacement of the ang phrase by asa phrase only after ayaw. For these speakers,
‘Pedro likes the teacher’ cannot be expressed by Gusto ni Pedro sa titser.)
      For many speakers the replacement of the ang phrase by a sa phrase after ayaw is obligatory if the
definite object    is expressed     by a personal noun or personal pronoun.        For these speakers ‘I don’t like
Pedrofhim’ is:
                                    kay Pedro.
                  Ayoko
                                    sa kaniya.
rather than:
                                  f si Pedro.
                  Ayoko
                                  l siya.

the shape gusto/ayaw- plus-ng-phrase-plus-sa-phrase are ambiguous. In these sentences, the sa phrase may be
interpreted either as a definite object or as a directional object. For example, Ayako Kay Pedro may mean
cither ‘| don’t like Pedro’ or ‘I don’t like to go/come to Pedro's’, ‘I don’t like to be at Pedro’s’. In the latter
interpretations, the sentence represents the pscudo-verb-phrase-plus-directional-object construction dealt
with under (3) below.)
      (2)   PSEUDO-VERB      PHRASE        PLUS       INDEFINITE   OBJECT.      In this construction, the pscudo-verb
phrase is followed by a ng phrase that is translated by an indefinite object (‘a/an’ plus noun, ‘some’ plus
noun, etc.) in the English equivalent. The ag phrase representing the indefinite object must be either ng plus
an unmarked noun or the ng form of a dcictic pronoun. (Personal nouns and personal pronouns always
express meanings of definiteness, and thus do not occur in this construction.) Some examples are:
                Kailangan
                Gusto )
                Ibig                     ng bata ng lapis.
                Nais (
                Ayaw                                     \ needs
                ‘The-child               wants/would like              a pencil.”
                                         doesn’t want        {                Kailangan
                Gusto
                Ibig                     niya nito.
                Nais
                Ayaw
                                needs some                   }
                ‘He             wants/would like some               of this.""
                                doesn’t need any             f
      (3)   PSEUDO-VERB      PHRASE        PLUS       DIRECTIONAL     OBJECT.       In this construction, a pseudo-verb
phrase with gusto, ibig, nais, or ayaw is followed by a sa phrase that represents a place toward which the
actor (i.¢., the referent of the actor complement) ‘wants’ or ‘doesn’t want’, etc., to move, or a place at/in
which he ‘wants’ or ‘doesn’t want’, to be. (If the noun in the sa phrase designates a person, the sa phrase
represents a place associated     with    that    person— usually his home.)        In the English equivalents of the
construction, the translation-equivalent of the pseudo-verb is usually followed by ‘to go/come to —’ or ‘to
be at/in       *, Some examples of the construction are:                Gusto
                Ibig
                                   ng Nanay sa tindahan.
                Nais
                Ayaw                                   wants/likes/would like                             go/come to

interpreted either as a definite object — see construction type (1), above — or as a directional object. In the
former interpretation, the sentence means ‘They don’t like Maria’.)
      (4)   PSEUDO-VERB           PLUS      OBJECT         PLUS     TOPIC.      The      pseudo-verb     ayaw    occurs   in   three
constructions in which it is not followed by a ng-phrase actor complement.                             In these constructions the
‘actor’ (i.e.. the person who ‘doesn’t like/want’) is expressed by the topic of the sentence, an ang phrase.
Two of the constructions are presented here. (The third is presented in subsection (7), below.) In one, the
sentence includes, in addition to ayaw and the topic, a ng phrase that serves as the indefinite object of
ayaw: ©.g.,                 Ayaw ng mansanas si Juan.
                 ‘Juan doesn’t like apples.”","[273, 274, 275]"
"      In some cases, however, the English counterparts include some verb other than be: ¢.g.,                   May gulayan ang babae.                    ‘The woman has a vegetable garden.”
                   Kailangan ko ang kuwalta.                 ‘I need the money.’
                   Sa istudyante ang libro.                  ‘The book belongs to the student.’What distinguishes these adjective-phrase predicates from genuine verbal predicates is the fact that they are
not marked for ASPECT (cf. §2.7). That is, they are not susceptible to variations in form correlated with
variations in tense-like meaning.
      Tagalog has a good many different types of adjective phrases, the details of which are presented in
§4.17 through 4.23. In these sections, certain single words that have semantic and distributional similarities
to adjective phrases — rather than, say, to ma- adjectives or unaffixed adjectives— are dealt with together
with the phrases they resemble. (Thus, for example, locative deictics like narito ‘here’ and naroon ‘There’
are dealt with together with locative phrases like nasa Kusina ‘in the kitchen’.",[75]
"
§3.13. Modification constructions:            noun head with adjective modifier.
        There is a group of adjectives which, in simple modification constructions headed by an unmarked
noun, regularly precede the linker. These adjectives include the CARDINAL and ORDINAL NUMBERS (cf.
§4.4) and a small list of other words, called LIMITERS (cf. §3.22), that express quantity or order in a
series: ¢.g., marami ‘much, many’, huli ‘(the) last’. Thus, corresponding to the sentences:                Dalawa
                Marami
                                 ang bata.
                Ikalawa
                Huli                ‘There are two children.’ (Literally: ‘The children are two.”)
                ‘There are many children.’ (Literally: ‘The children are many.’)
                ‘The child is second.”
                ‘The child is last.”are the following modification constructions:                dalawang                              “two children’
                maraming                              ‘many children’
                                       bata
                ikalawang                             “the second child’
                huling                                ‘the last child’(In modification constructions consisting of a deictic and a number or limiter, word order is determined by
which    of the two elements is the head, as in the case of the deictic-plus-unmarked-noun modification
constructions discussed in §3.12. Thus ifong dalawa is ‘these fwo’, with head ito and modifier dalawa,
while (ang) dalawang ito is ‘these two’, with the nominalized head dalawa and the modifier ito.)
      Word order is much less fixed in simple modification constructions that involve modifying adjectives
other than numbers or limiters. In the case of such constructions, decided word-order preferences obtain
only when the construction occurs as an unmarked predicate. In this position, if the adjective and the noun
provide equally new or equally important information, the order noun-linker-adjective is preferred: e.g.,                Doktor na bantog ang ama ni Juan.
                ‘Juan's father is a famous doctor.’The order doktor na bantog ‘famous doctor’ suggests that the audience knows neither that Juan’s father is a
doctor nor that he is a famous one.
122                                                                                               CHAPTER 3       Hf, however, the information provided by the noun is relatively well-known or self-evident, while the
information provided by the adjective is less well known or less self-evident, the order adjective-linker-noun
is preferred: c¢.g.,                Bantog na tao ang ama ni Juan.
                ‘Juan’s father is a famous man.”","[131, 132]"
"However,   when      a count-noun        grouping   is designated       by   a nonpluralized   deictic   pronoun,   or by a
modification construction beginning with a deictic pronoun, the ng form of the pronoun is used:                                  nito
                  marami
                                  nitong (mga) bulaklak na ito                                  these’
                  *a lot of
                                  these flowers’(In marami nito, the deictic may also refer to a mass-noun grouping, in which case the phrase means ‘a lot
of this.°) If the deictic pronoun is explicitly pluralized, the marker sa is used:                 marami sa mga ito                   ‘a lot of these’(After marami - but not after other limiters — there is some variation in the use of sa and ng phrases. While
some speakers follow the generalization given above, two other patterns are found in the case of nominals
other than deictics:
      (1) Some      speakers   use only sa phrases, regardless of whether a mass- or count-noun grouping is
designated; thus, for these speakers:                                                                 (mga) mangga.

      In addition to the expression of a grouping, a grouping numeral may be used to express the idea of
excessive number, as in:               Bakit dala-dalawa ang lapis mo?

number. They consist of a repeated utterance of certain of the clements used in the formation of complex
cardinal numbers. The indefinite numerals in common use are:               daan-daan                         ‘hundreds’
               libu-libo                         ‘thousands’
               angaw-angaw                       ‘millions’(Milyon-milyon ‘millions’ also occurs, but is less common than the forms listed above.) Like their English
equivalents, the indefinite numerals can often be used more or less interchangeably, to indicate ‘a large
number.’ Some examples of their use are:               Daan-dan
               Libu-libo                ang kaibigan niya.
               Angaw-angaw                             hundreds

phrase consisting of a cardinal number plus ‘times’: e.g.. makaapat {maka(:)’a‘pat/ ‘four times’,
makasampu /maka(*)sampu’/ ‘ten times’. They are formed by prefixing maka- (/maka/ of /maka’/ — the
form with inherent vowel length is probably the more common) to a cardinal number of Tagalog origin. In
most cases, the form of the cardinal number is retained intact within the frequentative numeral. The
frequentative formations based on dalawa ‘two’ and fatlo ‘three’ are, however, irregular:                makalawa                   {maka(‘)lawah/                      ‘two times, twice’
                makaitlo                   {maka(‘)'itloh/                     ‘three times’Some further examples of regular formations are:               makalima                       {maka(:)limah/                         ‘five times’
               makaanim                       {maka(‘)’a*nim/                        ‘six times’
               makaapatnapu                   {maka(‘)’a’ patnapu’/                  ‘forty times’(There is no maka- formation based upon isa ‘one’. The equivalent of ‘one time, once’ is expressed by
minsan.)
      Frequentative numerals are used to form nang frequency adverbs. For discussion and illustrations of
these adverbs, cf. §6.8, subsection (1.a).

       In addition to the ang, ng, and sa forms presented in §3.4, and the nasa forms presented in section
§4.19, there are distinctive forms of the deictic pronouns that are equivalent to the sentence-initial ‘here’
and ‘there’ of English sentences such as: ‘Here/There he is’, ‘Here’s/There’s the water, boiling already’, etc.
These distinctive forms may be called ATTENTION-DIRECTING DEICTICS. (Note that the English
equivalents of the attention-directing deictics are distinguished from locatives only by position in the
sentence   (compare      ‘Here   he is’, in which   ‘here* is attention-directing, and ‘He is here’, in which ‘here* is
locative). The Tagalog attention-directing and locative deictics, on the other hand, are formally distinct
(compare (Heto siya ‘Here he is’ and Narito siya ‘He is here’.).
      Tagalog has four attention-directing deictics, one corresponding to each of the usual deictic categories
(cf. §3.4). Three of the four attention-directing deictics occur in two freely alternating forms, one with
initial /h/, the other with initial /‘/. The following is a list of the attention-directing dcictics, in both
conventional spelling and phonemic transcription. To the right of each attention-directing deictic appears
its English-translation equivalent, and the ang- form deictic to which it corresponds.                ere                           [ereh{                    *here’                (iri)                                              fhe-toh/

      Attention-directing deictics occur only in sentencc-initial position. They may constitute sentences in
themselves, equivalent to English ‘Here/There (it is)’:                Ere.

of kailangan and dapat, preceded by ay, etc.), any enclitic pronouns within the clause may be moved to a
position before the linker. If the pseudo-verb is kailangan or dapat, the placement of enclitic pronouns
before the linker is always optional: thus Kailangan akong mag-Ingles is an optional variant of Kailangang
mag-Ingles ako ‘1 should speak English’, and Dapat ko siyang makausap is an optional variant of Dapat (na)
makausap ko siya ‘I should talk to him’. If the pseudo-verb is maaari or puwede and the basic form is
goal-focus, the placement of enclitic pronouns before the linker is also optional: thus Maaari/Puwede ko
siyang    makausap     is an optional variant of Maaaring/Puweding makausap             ko siya.   \f, however,   the
pseudo-verb is magari or puwede and the basic form is actor-focus, the placement of enclitic pronouns
before the linker is obligatory: thus Maaari/Puwede akong mag-Ingles ‘| can speak English’ (not
*Maaaring/Puwedeng mag- Ingles ako).
         When   an actor-focus basic form follows the linker, and its topic is something other than a personal
pronoun, the topic may in all cases optionally precede the linker. Thus:                  Kailangan

predicate may also be moved to a position before the linker. If the pseudo-verb is dapat, the meaning is not
affected. Thus:                                   lider
         Dapat si Juang
                                   mabait.

      ‘Juan should be
                             | good.’If the pseudo-verb is maaari or puwede, the placement of the topic before the linker resolves a potential
ambiguity. The sentence Maaaring lider si Juan, for example, can be taken to mean either ‘It is possible for
Juan to be a leader’ os ‘It is possible that Juan is a leader’. That is, it may refer either to a hypothetical
possibility or to the possibility that a given situation actually obtains. The sentence Maaari si Juang lider, on
the other hand, means only ‘It is possible for Juan to be a leader’, and refers unambiguously to a
hypothetical possibility. Similarly Puwede si Juang mabait ‘It is possible for Juan to be good’ refers to a
hypothetical possibility while Pawedeng mabait si Juan may refer either to a hypothetical possibility or to
the possibility that a given situation actually obtains (in which case it has the meaning, ‘It is possible that
Juan is good*.) (When the topic of a nominal or adjectival after magari plus linker or puwede plus linker is a
personal pronoun, it may not be moved to a position before the linker unless the speaker wishes to refer to
a hypothetical possibility. Thus Maaaring/Puwedeng lider siya means only ‘It is possible that he is a leader’,
and the meaning ‘It is possible for him to be a leader’ is expressible only by Maaari/Puwede siyang lider.)
      (In yes-no questions — cf. $7.4 —snaaari and puwede (plus the interrogative particle ba) plus a linker
are sometimes followed by a basic form that is not accompanied by any expression of the actor. These
questions imply either an indefinite actor or a first-person-pronoun actor: e.g.,               Maaari/Puwede bang umalis ngayon?

§4.22. Possessive sa and may phrases.
      The possessive phrases dealt with in the present section are phrases that may occur as predicates of
basic or derived sentences. (In addition to these phrases, which may be called POSSESSIVE PREDICATES,
Tagalog has certain other constructions expressing possession that are discussed under the heading
POSSESSIVE MODIFIERS in §3.20.) Possessive predicates are of two main types, which may be called
POSSESSIVE sa PHRASES and POSSESSIVE may PHRASES. Possessive sa phrases occur as predicates of
sentences expressing possession of some specific, already-identified object or objects. The object possessed
is expressed by the topic of the sentence. If the nominal in the sa phrase has an animate referent, it
designates the owner of the object, and the sentence is often equivalent to an English sentence of the type
‘The           is/are        ’s‘ or ‘The         belong(s) to”:           eg.","[280, 281, 282, 283]"
"(Magwalis, the direct—action verb that corresponds to magpawalis, is an           object    verb.   Bumili,   the
direct—action verb that corresponds to magpabili, is a double—object verb.)
      (Since the secondary—actos complement and the directional complement are identical in form after
an AF indirect—action verb that corresponds to a double—object verb, there arc many cases of ambiguity.
Thus the sentence:               Magpabigay ka ng pera kay Rosa kay Maria.can mean either ‘Have Rosa give some money          to Maria’ (in which case kay Rosa is interpreted as a
secondary—actor complement, kay Maria as a directional complement) or ‘Have Maria give some money to
Rosa’ (in which case kay Rosa is interpreted as a directional complement, kay Maria as a secondary —actor
complement). This kind of ambiguity, which can be resolved only by context, can occur in the case of
various other focus—types of indirect—action verbs that correspond to direct—action double—object verbs.)
      The secondary—actor complement       has the form of an object complement when the corresponding
direct—action verb is a transitive verb belonging to the directional complement class (cf. §5.4) or is
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS                                                                                                     323intransitive    (cf.   §5.6).    (As is specified        in     §5.25, subsection (2), an object complement                within a
non-nominalized verbal is expressed by ang phrase, which must be cither ng plus an unmarked noun or the
ng form of a deictic pronoun, Within a nominalized verbal, the object complement is expressed by either a
ng phrase or a sa phrase if the nominal within the complement is an unmarked noun or a deictic pronoun,
and is expressed by asa phrase if the nominal within the complement is an unmarked noun or a deictic
pronoun, and is expressed by a sa phrase if the nominal within the complement is a personal noun or a
personal pronoun.) Thus in the following sentences the secondary—actor complements are identical in form
with object complements occurring in similar contexts:                                                  { ng bata

direct—action verb that corresponds to magpatulog, is an intransitive verb.) As the above examples show,
secondary—actor complements that have the form of object complements carry the same meanings of
definiteness or indefinitencss as are carried by object complements occurring in similar contexts.
       There is at least one AF indirect—action verb that constitutes an exception to the above
generalizations. This is the verb magpekain ‘feed’ (literally, ‘permit/cause to cat’), which corresponds to the
324                                                                                              CHAPTER5double—object direct—action verb kumain ‘eat.’ When magpakain is followed by an object complement, the
formation of the secondary—actor complement is regular; that is, it is identical in form with a directional
complement: ¢.g.,                Magpakain ka ng darak sa baboy.
                ‘Feed the pig some rice bran.’(The indirect—actor complement in the above sentence is sa baboy ‘the pig.”) When, however, magpakain is
not followed by an object complement, the secondary—actor complement is identical in form with an
object complement. Thus:                Magpakain ka ng baboy.
                              a
                ‘Feed                       pig.”
                              the(in the case of other indirect—action verbs, only a sa-phrase secondary—actor complement would occur in
similar structures. Thus:                Magpawalis ka sa katulong.
                “*Let/Have the maid sweep.”but not:                *Magpawalis ka ng katulong.)      (Secondary—actor complements also occur with indirect—action verbs of the focus types presented in
subsections (3) and (4), below. With these focus types, the secondary—actor complement is always in the
form of asa phrase.)
      Certain AF indirect—action verbs that correspond to intransitive direct—action verbs may occur
without a secondary—actor complement in a REFLEXIVE              INDIRECT-ACTION     CONSTRUCTION. The
direct—action verbs to which these indirect—action verbs correspond are, for the most part, ma- and -um-
verbs of ‘becoming’ (cf. §5.6, classes D and J), and the meaning of the indirect—action verb is ‘permit/cause
oneself to become      _.” Some examples are:                Nagpapapagod si Nene.
                ‘Nenc is letting herself get tired.”                (cf.    Napapagod si Nene.
                        ‘Nene is getting tired.”)                Nagpapataba si Nene.
                ‘Nenc is trying to put on weight.”
                (Literally: ‘Nene is making herself get fat.”)                (cf.    Tumataba si Nene.
                        “Nene is getting fat.’)       Sentences like those just illustrated are at least potentially ambiguous. For, in addition to the
reflexive interpretation shown in the English translations above, the sentences allow of a non-reflexive
interpretation as well. This latter interpretation involves the assumed deletion of a secondary—actor
complement after the verb. (A secondary—actor complement, like other complements, is optionally
deletable in cases where its referent is indefinite or is clear from context.) Thus, for example, Nagpapataba

taken to be similar in meaning to a sentence like:                Nagpapataba ng manok si Nene.
                ‘Nene is fattening a chicken.*
                (Literally: ‘Nene is making a chicken get fat.’)(The reflexive meaning may be made unambiguous by the inclusion in the sentence of a reflexive nominal
construction (cf. §3.21) serving as a secondary—actor complement. Thus:                Nagpapataba ng sarili (niya) si Nene.
                ‘Nene is trying to put on weight.”","[333, 334, 335, 336]"

content of some utterance, bul not to reproduce the utterance in its original form. Indirect-quotation
clauses occur as topics opposite certain object-focus verbs, as object complements with certain actor-focus
or directional-focus verbs, and, in some cases, as inverted predicates (see the discussion under (b), below).
Indirect-quotation clauses may be divided into three classes on the basis of their correspondence to certain
underlying sentence types: STATEMENT CLAUSES (corresponding to statements, whose basic structure is
described in Chapter 2); IMPERATIVE CLAUSES (corresponding to imperative sentences— cf. §5.29);
and INTERROGATIVE CLAUSES (corresponding to questions — cf. § §7.3 through 7.12).
       Except when they occur in sentence-initial-position (see the discussion under (d), below), or as
inverted predicates (see the discussion under (b)), indirect-quotation clauses are introduced either by the
linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11) or by the particle kung. The linker na/-ng is used to introduce both statement
clauses and imperative clauses:                                      kay Pedrong
                Sinabi ko                                  narito ka.

                                     kay Manuel na                                     Pedro       )
                 ‘I ordered                                          to finish the work.”
                                     Manuel((There is often a rhythmic break before a nominal clause, such that the clause constitutes a distinct
intonation phrase (cf. §1.23). When a rhythmic break occurs befose a clause introduced by the linker
naj-ng, the break precedes the linker, and the /na/ form of the linker is used, whatever the preceding word.
Thus, also: Sinabi ko kay Pedro na narito ka, etc.)
       The particle kung is used to introduce interrogative clauses: ¢.g.,                 Itinanong ko sa kanya kung narito ka.
                 ‘L asked him if you were here.’Clauses introduced by na/-ng or kung are never preceded by a nominal marker (ang, ng, etc.).
       Statement clauses have essentially the same internal structure as statements. Thus:                 Sinabi kong maganda si Maria.
                 ‘I said that Maria was beautiful.’                 (cf.   Maganda si Maria.
                        ‘Maria is beautiful.’)                 Sinabi kong nakita kita doon.
                 ‘I said that I saw you there.”                 (cf.   Nakita kita doon.
                        ‘I saw you there.’)      Imperative clauses have essentially the same internal structure as imperative sentences (e.g., they
always include the basic form of a verb), but, while the actor in an imperative sentence is always expressed
by asecond-person pronoun, the actor in an imperative clause may be expressed by nominals of other types
as well. Thus:                                                         ko
                                                         mo

                         Wait.’)       When the person who is to perform the action expressed by the imperative clause is specified earlier
in the sentence, the word or phrase expressing the actor within the imperative clause is optionally deletable.
Thus:                 Sinabi ng Nanay sa aking kanin (ko) ang pagkain.
                 ‘Mother said to me that I should eat the food.’
                 (Or: ‘Mother told me to eat the food."")                 Sinabi ng Nanay sa inyong maghintay (kayo).
                 ‘Mother said to you that you should wait.’
                 (Or:   ‘Mother told you to wait.’)        Interrogative clauses have essentially the same internal structure as questions, except that the enclitic
particle ba (cf. §6.4, subsection (g)), which is optionally present in the questions, is never present in the
clauses. Interrogative     clauses   may    correspond   to yes-no questions, information questions,    alternative
questions, elc.: ¢.g.,                 Itinanong ko kung darating siya.
                 ‘I asked if he was coming.”                 (cf.    Darating (ba) siya?
                         ‘Is he coming?’)                 Itinanong ko kung kailan siya darating.
                 ‘I asked when he was coming.”                 (cf.    Kailan (ba) siya darating?
                         ‘When is he coming?’                 Itinanong ko kung darating siya, o hindi.
                 ‘I asked whether he was coming or not.                 (cf.    Darating (ba) siya, o hindi?
                         ‘Is he coming, or not?’)      Indirect-quotation clauses serve all the same sentence functions as direct-quotation clauses. That is,
they occur as:                 (a)     topics with certain object-focus verbs;
                 (b)     inverted predicates with certain nominalized object-focus verb topics;
                 (c)     object complements with certain actor-focus and directional-focus verbs;
                 (d)     predicates opposite quotation-tag topics.","[181, 182, 183, 184]"
"When   the locative deictic in such       a construction is maroon (or one of its variants), the demonstrative
meaning of the deictic is often negligible, and the construction is more or less identical in meaning with a
locative construction lacking a deictic: e.g.,               Naroon sa Maynila si Juan.
               ‘Juan is (there) in Manila.’

      In addition to simple nominals (and nominalizations), the sa within a locative adjective phrase may be
followed by a POSITIONAL PHRASE. A positional phrase consists of one of a small group of unmarked
nouns — which may be called POSITIONAL NOUNS — and ang phrase. Some common positional nouns
are:

§4.20. Other relational phrases.
       The present section deals with adjectival phrases of six types: (1) RESERVATIONAL PIIRASES,
(2)   PARTISANSHIP     PHRASES;
                              (3) PURPOSE            PHRASES;
                                                            (4) SOURCE         PHRASES;

PHRASES; and (6) RELATIVE-LOCATION PHRASES. These six phrase types are similar in that each
consists of an introductory word followed by asa phrase (sa plus an unmarked noun, nominaliztion, or
sa-form personal pronoun; Kay or kina plus a personal noun; or a s@-form deictic pronoun). They are also
similar in that, when they occur in predicate position, they all express relationships between two
nominals: the nominal within the sa phrase and the topic nominal. The English equivalents of sentences
with such phrases in predicate position normally involve some form of ‘be’ plus a prepositional phrase.","[267, 268, 269]"
"§7.2.   Inversion constructions..
      An INVERSION CONSTRUCTION is a construction characterized by the shifting to sentence—initial
or clause—initial position of some sentence component that does not occur in this position in basic
sentences. Inversion constructions may involve the placement of a topic before a predicate, the placement
of an adverbial before a predicate, the placement of a verb complement before a predicate verb, the
placement of a phrase introduced by ni or ni... ni before the negator wala (cf. §7.14), or one of certain
combinations of these. The inversion constructions that occur in Tagalog are dealt with below under the
following headings:       (1) AY   INVERSION;       (2) CONTRASTIVE           INVERSION; (3) EMPHATIC         INVERSION;
(4) NON-EMPHATIC INVERSION.
      (1) AY INVERSION. Of the four classes of inversion constructions, ay inversion permits the widest
range of sentence—component types to be shifted to initial position. The initial component in an
ay-inversion construction          may   be: (a) the topic; (b) an adverbial; (c)a verb complement; (d) a phrase
introduced by i or ni... ni. The inversion—marking particle ay in most cases immediately follows the
initial topic, adverbial, etc. As is noted in §6.6, however, certain enclitic particles, if they occur in the
sentence, either obligatorily or optionally precede ay. Ay may also be immediately preceded by a pause.
This pause, which is represented in the writing system by a comma, is optional in all cases.
       Ay has two forms: a full form, /‘ay/, written ay in conventional spelling, and a contracted form, /y/,
written ‘y in conventional spelling. The full form may occur in any context; the contracted form occurs as a
variant of the full form if the preceding word, in its independent occurrences, ends in /”/, /hj, /n/, or /w/,
and if this word is not followed by a pause. When the contracted form is used, it replaces a final /°/, /h/, or
/n/, and either replaces or follows a final /w/. Thus, bafa /ba‘ta’/ ‘child’ plus 'y is /ba‘tay/, ama /’amah/
‘father’ plus ‘y is /’amay/, pinsan /pinsan/ ‘cousin’ plus ‘y is /pinsay/, and ikaw /’ikaw/ ‘you’ plus ‘y is either
['ikay/ or /’ikawy/. The contracted form of ay is more commonly used than the full form in the case of
words that, in their independent occurrences, end in /*/ or /h/. In the case of words that end in /n/ in their
independent occurrences, the contracted and full forms of ay are equally common if the word is of native
Tagalog origin: thus, either pinsan ay or pinsa'y. If the word is a loan—word from English or Spanish,
however, the full form is in most cases preferred:            thus, Helen ay’, rather than Hele'y, and Juan ay, rather
than Jua’y. In the case of words that end in /w/ in their independent occurrences, the contracted and full
forms are equally common in all cases. Whether or not the /w/ is retained in pronunciation, it is always
retained in conventional writing: thus ikaw 'y (never *ika'y).
        A sentence involving ay inversion docs not differ in denotative meaning from the related sentence
without inversion. There is usually, however, a difference in stylistic level, or level of usage, between the
two sentences. Ay inversion is characteristic of formal style, and is more common in writing, lectures,
sermons, etc., than it is in ordinary conversation. In the examples of ay inversion given below, the notation
“(formal style)” is usually placed after the translations of the sentences. (But sce (1.a.3), etc., following.

position are:                Ang mga anak ay kayamanan ng mga magulang.
                ‘Children are the parents’ jewels.” (formal style)                (cf.   Kayamanan ng mga magulang ang mga anak.
                       ‘Children are the parents’ jewels.’)                Kayo’y mabait na mabait.
                *You are very kind.” (formal style)                (cf.   Mabait na mabait kayo.
                       “You are very kind.’)                Ang sulat ay tinanggap ko kahapon.
                ‘I received the letter yesterday.’ (formal style)                (cf.   Tinanggap ko ang sulat kahapon.
                       ‘I received the letter yesterday.’)      (a) The following features of constructions involving ay inversion of the topic may be noted:
      (a.1) When the inverted topic is the second—person—singular pronoun, the form ékaw replaces the
usual topic form ka (cf. §3.3). Thus:                Ikaw ay nakita nila roon.
                ‘They saw you there.’ (formal style)                (cf.   Nakita ka nila roon.
                       ‘They saw you there.)Similarly, ikaw... ko replaces the composite pronoun kita (which, as is noted in §3.3, is itself a
replacement of the non-occurring sequence *ko ka.) Thus:                Ikaw ay nakita ko roon.
                ‘I saw you there.’ (formal style)                (cf.   Nakita kita roon.
                       ‘I saw you there.’)      (a.2) In ay inversion the topic marker ang is optionally deletable before the limiters bawa't ‘each’ and
lahat ‘all’ (cf. §3.22). Thus:                Ang bawa’t
                                   bata’y may desk.
                Bawa’t
                ‘Each child has a desk.” (formal style)                (cf.   May desk ang bawa’t bata.
                       “Each child has a desk.’)

nominalized—verbal topics (cf. §3.24) or opposite nominalized pseudo—verb or pseudo—verb—phrase
topics (cf. §4.21), either ay inversion or contrastive inversion of topic and predicate is obligatory. An
example of ay inversion involving a nominalized—verbal topic is:                Ang narinig ko'y darating siya bukas.
                “What I heard is that he’s coming tomorrow.”","[597, 598, 599]"
