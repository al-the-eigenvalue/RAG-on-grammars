to note that the purpose of the switch reference system in
the continuum of speech is to indicate whether or not the
subject of the situation which the srveaker is about to express
will or will not be coreferential with the subjecc cf the
situation which he is just finishing expressing                 (the verb in
a medial clause always occurs           clause-finaity    sco the indicator
of corefereniality or noncoreferentiality             is always the Last
constituent of a clause).          If it is indicated       that th         weject
of the situaticn about to be expressed will be coreferential
with    the subject of the situation just expressed,               then tne
identity of the subject of the situation about to be expres vad
is given infermation        in that following     clause.      On the other
hand the marking of noncoreferentiality            indicates       that the
identity of the subject in the           clause about to be expressed                                                 The            Gual                  forms             are    included             for     completeness                                                      a

2.2.6.3.        Compoung_morpholocy
    Nouns or noun phrases          can readily be coordinated by simple
juxtaposition     to manifest a single         function within the clau ise
or sentence.      Some such combinations occur           frequently and
have a composite meaning which is not necessarily predictable
from the meanings       of the constituent elements.            They behave
as a unit as regards         their potential      for combining with
attributive elements         in the noun phrase.        Since the individual
constituents     retain their morphological          shape I consider       «he
combined    structures     to be complex noun phrases rather than
comsound nouns      (see 1.2.5.1).         Similarly verb stems may
readily be ccordinated          to manifest the predicate         function ci
the   clause or sentence.          Only the last stem in the paratactic
secuence    carries suffixation          (see 2.1.3.7).     Again I regard
 these structures      as being complex verb chrases           rather than
 compound verbs because:          (i)  there is no restriction        (other
 than     semantic}       as        to   which        verb     stems     may   occur     within      auch
 &@ sequence; and  (ii) the individual    constituent elements
 retain their morphological    shape.   However   some sequences cot
 verks cccur very frequently,    e.g.  add ot fit, above do give,
  ‘to dress somebody else',  al 12, shoot put,      ‘to kill by
