            ‘in the bush’                      ‘in the sun’    (2) The Substantive Clitic occurs obligatorily on the last
word in the Substantive Phrase and optionally on the last word of
a nominalized clause.   Generally, it binds several preceding
words     into one    nominal   unit.    Its forms   are -a/-wa,     which    are
used interchangeably without affecting the meaning and which
occur following a vowel-final stem, and -ewa oo -awa which
follow consonant-final stems.   Only wataget ‘formerly’, iman
‘tomorrow’,        and pu   ‘bush’      have been observed with the -awa
allomorph.   A shorter form -e alternates with -ewa.  In some
cases a noun suffixed with -wa functions grammatically just as
does that same noun without the Substantive Clitic.
     The Substantive        Clitic functions on several levels of the
grammar.    It occurs on nouns, as mentioned above, to mark a
substantive relationship between nouns in the Substantive Phrase,
and it optionally      marks    the Comment      tagmeme      of the Equational
Clause.      In cases where the context is ambiguous,              the -wa clitic
is obligatory      and distinguishes      an Equational Clause from          a Mod-
ified Noun Phrase.          Adjectives which are filling the Itemg            tag-
meme of the Substantive Phrase also receive the clitic -wa. The
occurrence of -a or -wa following the Included Clause Clitic in-
dicates that the clause is expounding another phrase-level or
clause-level tagmeme.            Following the Medial Suffixes it indicates
that there is a change of actor in the following clause.                Following     |
Durative Suffixes it indicates that simultaneous action is meant.                             |
There is also a tendency to alternate the presence and absence of                             |
-wa when more than two verbs with Medial Suffixes occur in the
same sentence.

with the Medial Suffixes which occur with the Verb Exocenter
Type A. The Included Clause Clitic and Medial Suffixes have the
same form and allomorphs, and both occur following the Subject-
Person/tense Suffix of the Verb Exocenter Type A. It agrees in
person with the Subject-Person Suffix and indicates that the
clause    is expounding        a phrase-level       or clause-level tagmeme.
In the chart below,        the basic forms of the Included Clause Clitic
will be given.        Allomorphs     are listed with the Medial        Suffixes
in Section 3.4.2.2.

do not have any suffixes.  However, occasionally, in certain en-
vironments as will be indicated below, a particular form occurs
with a first order suffix.","[33, 34, 35]"
"    (2) Pronouns fill the Subject tagmeme of clauses, the Head of
Coordinate Noun Phrases, the Possessor and Referent tagmemes
of the Possessive Phrase,              the Referent of Kinship Phrases,       the
Item of Appositional Phrases, the Accompanier and Axis of Per-
sonal Accompaniment Phrases, and the Topic or Comment of
Equational Clauses.   It is unusual to find a pronoun in the free
Object or Indirect Object tagmemes of clauses because the verbal
suffixes replace the free pronouns, but it does occur perhaps as
a way of highlighting the object or indirect object.
     Pronouns are never possessed.                 They have a different set of
first order    suffixes than do other word types.
     There    are only six pronouns         in Daga.

    (a) The possessive -ga suffixed to the basic pronoun com-
prises the possessive pronoun which occurs in the Possessor
tagmeme of the Possessive Phrase.

clause-level Purpose tagmeme and in the third person fill the
Relator in the Purpose Phrase.     Alternate shorter forms occur
in the commonly used third person; menan alternates with men,
and munan alternates with mun,                               Purpose     Pronouns                       Singular                  Plural

             3          menan/men                     munan/mun    (c) Emphatic pronouns consist of the basic pronoun plus -k.
The emphatic pronoun fills the Subject tagmeme of clauses or the
Apposition tagmeme of Appositional Noun Phrases.       The emphatic
pronoun also encodes the reflexive meaning, which is optionally
highlighted by the use of ingane ‘(reflexive)’ after the emphatic
pronoun,

             3          mek                             muk    (d) The exclusive pronoun manifests the clause-level Manner
tagmeme.    The person of the exclusive pronoun agrees with the
Subject or Object of the clause.  Either -genat or -aget mark
the exclusive pronoun.   There is a tendency for older speakers
of Daga to use the -aget suffix.

the exclusive suffix.    Optionally the substantive clitic -wa occurs
on a possessive pronoun when it manifests the Comment tagmeme
of the Equational Clause or is the only manifestation of a Posses-
sive Phrase.    Other occurrences of -wa following the possessive
suffix do not seem to alter the meaning.                     ne-genat-a                                     mu-ga-wa

Modified Noun Phrase,              in the Item 9      tagmeme of the Substantive
Phrase,          in the Head of the Nonpersonal Accompaniment Phrase,
in the Head tagmemes of the Emphatic Intensified Phrase and the
Superlative Intensified Phrase, and in the Comment tagmeme of
Equational Clauses.    In addition, a few adjectives in appropriate
contexts may be the only manifestation of a Substantive Phrase,
in which case they will have the Substantive clitic -wa.   A few
others optionally fill the Manner tagmeme in clauses, and others,
as mentioned         in relation to the       stem   level   (see   2.3),    can take the
verbalizer suffix.

    the positionals         (Section 3.2) do not occur in the Modified Noun
    Phrase.
        Since locatives manifest the Demonstrative tagmeme of the
    Modified Noun Phrase, in the proper context, the locative is the
    only manifestation of the Noun Phrase.   In such cases the locative                                  —

         The locatives          are relative to the speaker,                 the subject or
    location under discussion, and to each other.
        The locative suffixes are all mutually exclusive first order
    suffixes.

Uninflected verb stems occur in the first and second Bases of the
Merged Sentence and in some other minor slots of the Verb Phrase.
The major verb in a Verb Phrase, however, must be inflected
with either a subject person/tense or nonpast medial person
suffix.  There are a total of four orders of verbal suffixes.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]"

                            INTRODUCTION
    This   is a description of the grammar      of Daga,   a non-
Austronesian language spoken by approximately 5, 000 Papuans
living in the Owen Stanley Mountains in the Rabaraba (formerly
Baniara) Subdistrict of the Milne Bay District and in the Abau
Subdistrict of the Central District of Papua New Guinea.   The
general linguistic theory upon which this description is based is
tagmemic theory as developed by Robert E. Longacre in Gram-
mar Discovery Procedures (Mouton, 1964) and as expanded in his
various writings since then, and especially in Hierarchy and Uni-
versality of Discourse Constitutents in New Guinea Languages
(Georgetown University Press,         1972).
     One of the fundamental assumptions of tagmemics is that in
language there are three simultaneous interlocking hierarchies--
grammatical, phonological, and lexical.    This paper describes
only the grammatical hierarchy of Daga, and few,if any, inter-
relationships between grammar and the other hierarchies are
given.   The focus of this grammar is to present the levels of the
grammatical hierarchy as they are related to each other, start-
ing with the word, progressing through phrase, clause, and sen-
tence, and ending with discourse.   Morphemes are described
along with the words with which they occur.    An attempt is made
to state the contrast,   variation,    and distribution for each con-
struction.  Tagmemic formulas         (in the form of bidimensional
arrays) are generally employed        to present each construction as
concisely as possible.
    Tagmemic grammars have been criticized for dealing only
with surface structures and not with deep structures.    Although
time limited a study of deep structures in all levels of the hier-
archy, Chapter 6 examines both the surface and deep structures
of Daga multiclause sentences.   This chapter was inspired and
guided by Longacre’s work in this subject, especially by his
lectures given in Papua New Guinea and by his two articles with
Ballard and Conrad on the deep and surface structure of inter-
clausal relations.   (Foundations of Language 7:70-118,        1971;
Language Data Asian Pacific Series No. 1, 1971.)
     A variety of analytical problems were met during the research
into Daga grammar, of which the following are typical:
 (a) One of the analytical problems that arose was the treatment of
the suffix -wa which occurs on nominal and verbal forms (see 3.]).                                        l
2                            DAGA      GRAMMAR
The problem was complicated by the fact that it has different
functions according to its distribution on verbal forms. Finally,
it was decided to describe all occurrences on nominal forms as
the Substantive Clitic and, in order to avoid confusion, to also
call it the Substantive Clitic when it occurs on verbal forms,
even though it has a variety of different functions on verbs              in
addition to the marking of a nominal construction.
(b)   Related    to the problem    of the Substantive   Clitic   was   the ho-
mophony of the included clause verbal form and the past medial
verb (see 3.4.2.2).    The Substantive Clitic optionally occurs on
both of these homophonous forms.      On the included clause verbal
form it marks the construction as nominal, but on the past medial
verb it marks a change of subject or has various other functions.
It was decided that the included clause verbal form and the past
medial verb are distinct but homophonous forms.(c) A decision also had to be made on certain morphemes                  and
free forms, such as -a~ gapan, den, umap, and menan, as to
whether they were functioning on the phrase level as relators for
relator-axis phrases or on the clause level as tagmeme markers
(see 3.1 (1), 3.2 8),     and 3.3 (2)).    The description seemed to be
simplified if they were handled on the phrase level.
(d)   At several points in the higher levels (see 6.3.16-6. 3.18)
where alternative analyses were possible, a description was pre-
ferred that involved recursion (the embedding of units within units
of the same level).   For example, a Summary Sentence was set
up in which the Action slot is normally filled by one of five sen-
tence types, instead of adding an optional Summary tagmeme to
the structures of these five sentence types.","[18, 19, 20]"

concerning deep structure used in this paper have been based on
the material in ""The Deep and Surface Structure of Inter-clausal
Relations"" by Ballard, Conrad, and Longacre which appears in

   7.1. Types of Linkage within the Paragraph.   Paragraphs,
except for embedded paragraphs, match the discourse-level tag-
memes.    Thus lexical items marking a new discourse-level tag-
meme also indicate a new paragraph.
   Internally, the paragraph in Daga is held together by various
features: Recapitulation, Conjunctions, mismatch of phonological
and grammatical sentences, same subject, purposeful useage of
the same sentence type, use of referents, and juxtaposition.
   (1) Recapitulation is of various types. The final verb of the
previous sentence may be repeated exactly, repeated with a tense
change, or repeated with a change from final to medial form.     In
some cases additional tagmemes are recapitulated with the predi-                                   291
292                                   DAGA    GRAMMAR
cate.  Factors governing the choice of what is recapitulated are
not known at this time.
    Recapitulation as a paragraph-internal cohesive factor is used
in all Discourse types except Epistolary Discourse, but is most
common in Narrative Discourse.      However, it is unusual to find
a paragraph that uses only recapitulation to bind the sentences
together.","[309, 310]"
"
     Linkage within   a paragraph in the Epistolary Discourse is
predominately by juxtaposition.    No recapitulation or sentence-
final linkage occurs.   A few conjunctions occur as paragraph
links.
    In most cases sentence breaks were arbitrarily determined
by the investigator since very little punctuation was used by the
writers.    These sentence breaks could easily have been desired
elsewhere by the writer, but there is no way to determine his
intentions.
    New Messages, Appeals, Greetings are usually clearly marked
by an initial vocative, pronoun, proper name,      den ‘also, and’,
nop da sia ‘another word’,    pirisi ‘please’, or a new Sentence
Topic.
     The subject matter of the Epistolary Discourses studied was
news and requests.    News included village happenings, such as
births, deaths, marriages, feasts, house building, and floods.
News items always occurred in the Message tagmeme.         Requests
occurred in the Appeal and usually contained pirisi ‘please’
somewhere in the request.     Requests divided into those request-
ing a reply to be written and thoserequesting the recipient of the
letter to purchase certain items for the writer.

     The obligatory formulaic Salutation always contained the
name of the recipient of the letter.  In seven out of the eight
letters a kinship term was coupled with the proper name.       This
kinship term gave the relationship between the writer and the
recipient.
    The formulaic signature occurred in five texts.  In four of
these both the kinship term and the proper name of the writer
occurred.        In the fifth,    only the writer’s name was used.

of discourse qin      However, in all types of discourse there are
rules based on grammatical structures of higher levels for deter-
mining the necessary occurrences of optional clause-level tag-
memes.    These rules apply to all paragraph types, but are mainly
determined by sequences within the discourse.
(1)     In general, if there is any problem knowing who the actor is,
       use the free subject tagmeme manifest by the simplest form
       (pronoun,   noun,    or ame ‘that’)    that will remove the ambiguity.
       Occasionally ambiguity is allowed to exist for one sentence
       and then is explained by the next sentence.
(2)     When the actor remains the same,              no free subject occurs
       since the verbal suffix indicates person.
(3)     When verbal     suffixes    show   actor without ambiguity    (e.g. ;
       we - he shift)      no free subject is needed.
(4)     When actor shifts and the verbal         suffix is ambiguous,    free
       subject is used.
(5)     If two third persons are involved in the text,          shift between
       actors is indicated by
                   a) free noun subject
                   b) ae between the clauses
                   c) amba between two medial verbs
                   d) one of the two medial verbs has the substantive
                      clitic
(6)     To move characters on and off the scene,             their proper name
       fills the subject slot. New dramatis personae are often intro-
       duced by means of an equational clause filling an Afterthought
       tagmeme.
404                              DAGA   GRAMMAR
(7)     Plural person verbal suffixes refer to everyone who is
       currently on the scene and continue to do so until otherwise
       overtly specified.  When specific ones out of the plural verbal
       suffix are meant,   they must be mentioned.    From    that point on
       until the entire group is gathered back in by a noun/nouns or
       ameme     ‘that’, the plural suffix refers only to the smaller
       group.
(8)     Ne   ‘I’ optionally expounds the free subject tagmeme,      even
       when the verbal suffix is clearly first singular,    to put the
       spotlight on one’s self.
(9)     Directionals   have their point of reference from    the last
       Place Name.
(10)     Props, such as nets, string bags, loin cloth, etc. must be
       specified with the noun unless the verb carries the generic
       idea.   (e.g., enapen ‘to put into’ means to put into a string
       bag’ and napen means ‘to eat food’).    But if a specific type of
       container or type of food is involved it must be mentioned.
(11)    Time   slot is filled to show passage of time and to mark the
       paragraph   boundaries.
(12)      The topic of a paragraph is given in the Sentence Topic
       tagmeme of the first sentence in the paragraph.     After that
       the topic under discussion is not mentioned again in that
       paragraph.

    In the eleven Personal Narrative Discourses studied the action
was always given in chronological order.    Occasionally an action
which was not in chronological order was inserted.    When such
an insertion occurs it does not recapitulate the previous sentence,
but instead the next sentence which is a continuation of the chrono-
logical order recapitulates the end of the sentence preceding the
insertion.   Personal Narratives are either told in the first person
or the third person and are predominantly in past tense.
     New tagmemes generally are indicated by change in time,
locale, actor, or movement from one place to another.   Such
terms as evi     ‘later’,   amba          ‘then’,   wan sen       ‘sunrise’,    muma
‘at night’ are used to indicate a change intime.     These must
occur sentence initially in the first sentence of the new tagmeme.
A new locale for the action is indicated predominantly by an equa-
tional clause or a location phrase expounding the peripheral
Afterthought tagmeme of the last sentence of the previous para-
graph.   Sometimes new dramatis personae for the next paragraph
are introduced in the same way as the new locale.   Thus the deep
and surface structures of the paragraph are out of phase at this
point.

      immediately             cave       named       Nanaun      ‘They ascended up through the stream here,                         the Oaip Stream,
then immediately              (they arrived)        at the cave named       Nanaun.’
In this example the medial clause is the final sequence in a Nar-
rative Paragraph.     The ‘cave named Nanaun’ is the setting for
the next paragraph.    In a few cases the change in locale was
given in the first sentence of the new paragraph/tagmeme.
    The new actor optionally is introduced in the same way as a
new locale but is more commonly given as a free subject filled
either by a proper noun or a pronoun in the first clause of the
paragraph.
     The final way of indicating a new tagmeme in Narrative Dis-
course is to use a motion verb in the sentence-initial position.
In all instances but one the motion verb was a medial form.
    When the speaker does not wish to indicate a new Episode or
other new tagmeme, a new time, locale, actor, or motion verb
will occur within the sentence nucleus.   Usually this sentence
will be linked to the sentence preceding it by recapitulation or
some other method of overt linkage.

      ‘I thus came          on and on again later...’
In the second example above,                      the evi ‘later’ is permuted after the
subject slot as a new tagmeme                      is not indicated.
    Autobiographical Personal Narratives usually indicate a new
Episode by a change in time or actor.    Narratives told in the third
person employ motion verbs or a new locale/dramatis personae
introduced in the Afterthought of the last sentence of the previous
paragraph.

    Linkage within the paragraph or tagmeme in the Autobio-
graphical Narrative is by juxtaposition or by the fact that the
object under discussion throughout the paragraph is mentioned
only in the first sentence. Recapitulation was rarely used except
in one text in which the speaker used a series of Close Sequence
Sentences in which the last verb must be in the present tense.
Each succeeding sentence then began with recapitulation of the
verb in the past tense.
    In contrast,     a narrative told in the third person links one
sentence to the next within the paragraph            predominantly    by re-
capitulation.","[395, 396, 397]"
"    The Sequence Marker in approximately 6 % of the examples
studied is permuted from the usual clause-initial position to a
position immediately following the first clause-level tagmeme
or to a prepredicate position.  The latter permutation is more
common.     In most cases the informant permitted the Sequence
Marker to return to the clause-initial position with no apparent
meaning change, but in a few cases the informant definitely
wanted the Sequence Marker in the prepredicate position.
Occasionally,         two identical Sequence Markers occurred,       one
clause-initial and one prepredicate.           Further investigation of
this problem is needed.
    The Sequence         Markers   also occur in the prenuclear     sentence
peripheral tagmeme. When boge ‘immediately’ occurs in this
position, it links the previous sentence and the sentence with
which it occurs into one paragraph.           Amba and evi in this
position indicate a new paragraph.           Gatawan has not been ob-
served in this position yet.
    Change of subject usually is unambiguous because of the
person suffixes on the verb. In the course of a Sequence Sen-
tence in which more than one third person actor is involved,
confusion as to actor is possible. There are two ways to in-
dicate change of actor when the person markers on the medial
verbs are identical,        either a Sequence Marker must occur be-
tween the two medial clauses or the first medial verb must have
the substantive clitic.
    In the following example          the Sequence Marker    amba    indi-
cates    that two different    actors   are involved:
   mot          wa-pi          amba      yav-epi-a
   powder       say-3s/m       then       see-3s/m-sc
   ‘It will become powder then he will look (at it) ...’
    In the following example of an Identical Predicate Sentence
embedded in a Sequence Sentence, the change of actor is indi-
cated by the presence and absence of the substantive clitic.   onam-on-e-wa               onam-on-e

              DEEP    AND SURFACE STRUCTURES
                      OF DAGA SENTENCES
     6.0.  This chapter is a description of Daga Sentence structures.
Items of the periphery which optionally occur with any sentence
will be described first.   The sentences which are not shown on the
chart (i.e., Simple, Contrary Result, Merged, and Direct Quote)
will then be described.
     Each description will include the distinctive contrastive fea-
tures of that particular sentence type followed by a bidimensional
array including exponents and deep grammar symbolization.         A
double line separates surface structures from deep structures.
Unusual deep encodings occur below the single line in the bidimen-
sional array.   The cross reference listed at the end of the unusual
encoding gives the more common surface structure for that par-
ticular deep structure.   Abbreviations and deep grammar symbols
used are described in the front of the paper.    Special features
listed below the bidimensional array are identified by lower-case
letters so that the same feature is discussed under the same letter
(e.g.,   negation will always be discussed under       (c)).   Features that
do not apply to the construction being described       are omitted,
    The following special features will be described,          if pertinent,
for a construction:
   ia)   any restrictions on tense of the verbs
         frequency and conditions governing occurrence          of optional
         tagmemes
    c)   negation
    d)   expansion possibilities
    e)   restrictions on exponents       of the tagmemes
    f) possible transformations
    g) reversal of tagmemes
     ) chronological order
    i comments on deep structure
    j)   occurrence of sentence final intonation between tagmemes
         of the construction
    k)   influence of construction on clause-level tagmemes
    1) same subject
    m) distribution on higher level

    Phonologically, a sentence in Daga is marked by final falling
intonation with varying degrees of pause, except for the yes-no
interrogative which has a rising intonation finally. Internally, the
intonation is level or dipping. A contrastive study of intonation
patterns is needed.
    Grammatically, the sentence is a combination of predications
and is held together by tense restrictions on tiie verbs and by other
restrictions on the exponents of the bases.   The medial-final dis-
tinction in the morphology of the verb exocenter is more important
in sentence constructions than the transitivity shown in the endo-
center.   Optional conjunctions occur in several sentence types.
    Recursion is common.      The bidimensional array of each sen-
tence type will indicate those sentence types which have been
found expounding the bases of that particular sentence.   Further
data should reveal a greater range of exponents in most cases.
    The examples will be listed according to their deep structure
and will follow the order of the deep structures as listed on the
bidimensional array.    Embedded examples will use an oblique ‘/’
to indicate the end of a non-medial clause and a double oblique‘//’
to mark    the end of a medial   clause.","[165, 166, 167, 168]"

          den    ‘with’     occurs as the Relator in both types of

                a new paragraph indicator in Epistolary Discourse.
                Den occasionally occurs in the Manner tagmeme on
                the clause level when it is translated as ‘also’. An
                alternate form dena is used when responding to a
                question and occasionally as the Accompaniment

superlative iragen/iren.
    The single Emphatic Intensifier root is di. It optionally occurs
in postposition to any Daga phrase, adjective, pronoun, locative,
negative, adverb, participle, conjunction, or nonpast medial verb
to add emphasis.    It rarely occurs sentence finally.  The final
vowel of the sentence-final verb optionally is lengthened to add
emphasis.    This construction substitutes for the sentence-final
di. Di also sometimes occurs as the Coordinate Marker in the
Coordinate Sentence.               umap       di
               ‘definitely acceptable’               kakae      di

after adjectives,       nouns,        and positionals.        Its most common   occur-
rence is with adjectives to make                 the superlative degree.               mama-na                  iragen

        Since the Daga system       of counting is based upon a man,        and
only five actual numerals          exist in the language (l, 2, 3,      4, and 10),
the number phrases comprise various ways of adding fingers and
toes and multiplying men (units of twenty) to arrive at the desired
number.    This gets rather complicated; therefore, the people
usually only use these numbers to twenty and then resort to Eng-
lish numbers.",[93]

those phrases which have an Axis related to the clause or phrase
in which they occur by postposition relators.  This phrase classi-
fication has five members: Accompaniment, Time, Resemblance ’
Purpose,         and Location.
    (1) There are two types of Accompaniment Phrases.   The
Personal Accompaniment Phrase and the Nonpersonal Accompa-
niment Phrase.    The Personal Accompaniment Phrase involves
persons and fills clause-level tagmemes.  The Nonpersonal
Accompaniment Phrase involves items or attributes rather than
persons and fills phrase-level tagmemes.

    The Personal Accompaniment Phrase has optional Accompani-
er and Axis tagmemes preceding the obligatory Relator tagmeme.
When the Accompaniment Postpositions den or boen expound the
Relator the Axis is obligatory. This phrase has been observed
in the clause level tagmemes of Subject and Object.

Special Features:
(a)    The Accompanier tagmeme usually overtly or covertly means
      aperson.     The person involved will be specified by verbal suf-
      fixes if the Accompanier tagmeme is not filled.(b)    Any of the Accompaniment Postpositions expound             the Relator.
      Different dialects prefer the alternates listed.
(c)    Tana and ena are obligatorily marked for person by the In-
      timate Possessive Suffixes. The person agrees with the per-
      son of the Axis. Since person is marked on          tana    and     ena,
      in context, the Axis is optional.

     Two major subclasses of noun stems result because of posses-

possession suffixes and are subdivided into body parts and kinship
terms.    Body parts optionally take the location clitic as a second
order suffix.    Kinship terms occur in the Kinship Phrase.
    Nonintimate            possession      is indicated by a Possessive           Phrase.
Nouns which occur in the Item of the Possessive Phrase are divi-
ded into those which occur with the location clitic and those which
do not.

      ‘your livers’                              ‘our feet’    In some constructions, intimate possessive suffixes are used
interchangeably with abbreviated intimate possessive suffixes.
But in Kinship Phrases, Idiomatic Clauses, and in body parts
which are possessed by other body parts, abbreviated intimate
possessive suffixes are preferred.   Abbreviated intimate posses-
sive suffixes are never followed by any other suffix. The first
person -n is used with kinship terms to form the Vocative.

       ‘Mother!’    Most nouns optionally occur with an -e suffix which may be
the third person singular possession suffix or a form of the sub-
stantive clitic.      However,        in a few examples the presence or
absence   of the final -e seems          to make    no difference in the mean-
ing.

      ven/vene               ‘call’    In addition to the preceding          suffix,   nouns   may   also be suffixed
with the location clitic,      the substantive clitic,       or the intensifier
suffix.  These are mutually exclusive and follow the possessive
suffix of intimately possessed noun stems and the stem of other
nouns which take suffixation.
     Intensifier suffixes: either -aet or -vet with their various
allomorphs intensify the noun indicating that item only was invol-
ved.    The allomorphs -naet,     -gaet, and-et alternate morpho-
phonemically with -aet.     The allomorph -vet follows vowel
final nouns, and the allomorph -avet follows consonant final
nouns.    A possible difference in meaning for these suffixes was
investigated without result.    Some nouns take either suffix. Other
nouns are limited to one or the other intensifier suffix.                 nani-naet

       (3)   Postpositions function to mark location,             accompaniment,
comparison,           and temporal      constructions.
       Location optionally is indicated by a free Location Postposi-
tion gapan/gan/gam or by the Location Clitic on nouns.                        The
Location Postposition is used interchangeably with the Location
Clitic, but the tendency is to use the Location Clitic when a
single noun manifests the Location tagmeme and to use the Loca-
tion Postposition when a phrase occurs in the Location tagmeme.
    The clause-level           Location tagmeme          also encodes     the instru-
mental meaning.

Special Features:
(a)     No further     expansion is possible.
(bo)    The Emotive Focus consists of those various body parts that
       are used to express different emotions and psychological char-
       acteristics.        Since there is no single emotional seat in Daga,
       body parts commonly involved are the insides, ears, back,
       stomach, and liver.    The body part is always the Subject of the
       clause.   The person involved is indicated by the possession
       which is marked on the body part by Abbreviated Intimate Pos-
       sessive Suffixes.   Like all possessive phrases a Referent tag-
       meme giving information about the possessor, such as name,
       optionally precedes the possessed body part.
(c)     The Lateral tagmeme occurs in specific idioms where it is

      obligatory.
(d)    Only adjectives for ‘big’ and ‘little’ have been observed mani-
      festing the Manner in the idioms for ‘sad’ and ‘angry’.     The
      Manner has not been observed in other idioms.
(e)     A limited number of idiomatic verbs inflected only in the third
      person singular optionally preceded by the negative                         ya   mani-
      fest the predicate.
(f)    The language is changing so that                     anu     ‘think; know’ substitutes
      for the idiomatic verb in the idiom for ‘sad’.    The person is
      not marked on the Emotive Focus as anu is inflected for all
      persons.    Although this form is heard increasingly in conver-
      sation, it is usually unacceptable in the written form.","[158, 159]"

Special         Features:

(b)     Possession is either intimate or nonintimate so that either
       possessive suffixes or free possessive pronouns expound the
       Possessor.
(c)     Occasionally the personal name and appropriate pronoun to-
       gether act as an Appositional Noun Phrase and fill the Referent.
(ad)    The Referent was used in about one-third of the examples.
(e)     Time and Manner tagmemes                    have been observed between the

     The distinction between final and medial clauses is more
important on the sentence level than the transitive-intransitive
division,   Combinations of medial and final] clauses are diagnostic
of several sentence types.   Medial clauses rarely occur in the
final Base of a phonological sentence and never occur in the final
Base of a grammatical sentence,

    5.1. Ditransitive Clause. Predicate, Object, and Indirect
Object tagmemes are nuclear to the Ditransitive Clause, although
only the Predicate is obligatory. The peripheral clause level tag-
memes will be presented in the Ditransitive Clause array.   These
peripheral tagmemes occur also in Transitive and Intransitive
  lauses,
     Since the Subject tagmeme is cross referenced in the Predicate
it could also be considered as a nuclear tagmeme in the clause.
However, since the occurrence of the optional Subject tagmeme is
governed by paragraph and discourse structure (see 8.6), it is not
diagnostic in the separation of clause types and has not been con-
sidered as nuclear.    The subject which is marked in the verb af-
fixation is the nuclear subject for the clause but does not so appear
due to limitations in the formula.

       x    t =temporal,     n =nounSpecial         Features:
(a)         Personal Accompaniment Phrase occurs only in the                         Subject
           and Object.
(ob) Resemblance Phrase occurs only in Time and Manner tag-
    memes,
(c) The pronoun rarely occurs in the Object or Indirect Object
           tagmemes because of the affixes on the verbs.    When a pro-
           noun occurs in the Object or Indirect Object it possibly adds
           emphasis.   It must agree with the corresponding verbal affix.
(a)         Any verb phrase with a ditransitive verb in the Head occurs
           in the Predicate.  Also one transitive verb wadi ‘teach’ mani-
           fests the Predicate of the Ditransitive Clause.  The ditransitive
           verb optionally occurs in all verb phrases except Object Focus,
   Definitive, and Stative Verb Phrases.
(e) The usual order of the tagmemes is as displayed,                           but     it is
           flexible.  Paragraph structure determines the position of the
           Time tagmeme.     It is clause-initial to indicate a new para-
           graph and permutes to the second or prepredicate position in
           the clause when a new paragraph is not indicated.      One clause-
           level tagmeme, either Subject, Location, or Purpose, is per-
           mitted in the Afterthought tagmeme of the sentence periphery.
           Generally,    Subject - Object - Predicate order is followed and
           the other lateral tagmemes            occur in almost any order.
(f)         The maximum number of tagmemes observed with the Predi-
           cate is six. The preferred limit is three or four. Short
           clauses are common because the Predicate carries informa-
           tion about the Subject,          Object,   and Indirect Object.         The occur-

      rence of a free Subject tagmeme                            is influenced by paragraph
      structure (see 8.6).
(g)     Location, Manner, and Purpose tagmemes optionally are
      repeated.    All repetitions occur together.   Manner has been
      observed to be repeated four times.      Seven repetitions of the
      Location have been observed.      Each repetition was a Location
      Phrase in which the Relator gapan occurred.         An alternate
      construction is to repeat the Predicate with the different Lo-
      cation tagmeme giving an Identical Predicate Sentence.       Repe-
      titions of other tagmemes within one clause do not occur, as
      the coordinate phrase constructions encode the information.","[149, 150, 151, 152]"

Special Features:
(a)       In Base, the simple present tense usually is used for regular
      verbs    and the continuous form for irregular verbs.                     Future
      tense is an understandable substitute for present tense,                      but
      the informant prefers            the present.        The past tense of Base,
      optionally occurs in the medial or same subject form.
(c)    The second Base optionally is negated but the first Base is
      negated only in special cases where the meaning permits.
(e)    The predicates of both Bases of the Coordinate Sentence ex-
      pounding Base must be present tense.    Optionally one is
      present durative tense,
(f)    This sentence is transformable into a Sequence Sentence in

Special     Features:(a)     The Antithetical Paragraph occurs mainly embedded in
       Narrative, Expositional, and Reason Paragraphs.  In one case
       the Thesis of the Antithetical Paragraph was expounded by an
       Antithetical Paragraph.  There are a few examples where the
       Antithetical Paragraph expounds a Discourse level tagmeme.(bo)    A Terminus filled by an Expositional             Paragraph     occurs with
       one Antithetical Paragraph.(c) The optional Link occurs in 67% of the examples studied.

       the Thesis or Antithesis.","[346, 347]"

sality of Discourse Constituents in New Guinea Languages: Dis-
cussion,     Georgetown University Press,                Washington,    D.C.,      1972.

derived from a few nouns by adding -at eo -am     ‘(verbalizer)’
to the noun root.  These stems occur only in the Qualitative
tagmeme of the Qualified Verb Phrase.                   ago               ago-at

by the suffix -at ~ #      . The nominalized verb occurs most
frequently in the first Head of the Desiderative Verb Phrase.      Al-
so the verb in the Indirect Quote Clause must be nominalized.
Other usages of nominalized verbs are rare, but occasionally
they fill the Head of the Modified Noun Phrase.

                                           WORDS
    3.0.  Words are inflectable units which are isolatable and
which cannot be further divided into free forms.  Words occur                        in
the hierarchical order above stems and below phrases.
    Word classes are distinguished from each other and by the
different tagzmemes in which they occur on the phrase and clause
levels,        by the number of suffixial orders and the           particular set
of suffixes occurring             with them,    and by the occurrence      of posses-
sion.         Some words fit into more than one class.             The subclasses
that occur will be noted with the               discussion of the particular
class.
    Word         classes    are   listed   as follows:
              Clitics
              Closed classes which generally occur without suffixes
                  Responses             Numerals
                  Exclamations          Negatives
                Postpositions                  Manner Adverbs
          Intensifiers            Temporals
          Conjunctions            Interrogatives
          Durative Adverb         Inconjugable Stems
       Open classes which optionally occur with one or two orders
of suffixes
          Nouns                   Adjectives
           Pronouns               Locatives
       Open classes which obligatorily occur with one suffix
           Verbs    3.1. Clitics. There are three clitics in Daga: (1) the
Location Clitic, (2) the Substantive Clitic, and (3) the Included
Clause Clitic.
        (1)    The Location Clitic indicates location and instrument.
Nouns inflected with the Location Clitic occur in the Location
tagmeme of the clause.
        Allomorphs         of the Location Clitic are     -p   o   -a oo   -i   o@   -u.
Generally,         vowel-final nouns take the -p allomorph           and consonant-
final nouns the -a. However, there are a few exceptions where a
vowel-final noun takes the -a allomorph, and there are three
words         with the -i allomorph        and one with the -u allomorph.","[30, 31, 32, 33]"

   (4) The Purpose Phrase consists of an obligatory Axis and
an optional Relator: In unambiguous constructions the Relator
may be omitted.                 This phrase     expounds        the clause level Purpose
tagmeme.

     (5) The Location Phrase consists of an obligatory Axis which
is joined to the rest of the clause by the optional Relator. The
Relator is omitted only in a nonambiguous context, such as place
verb combinations or with Place names.                     If the Location might be
confused with another             clause-level tagmeme,        the Relator is obli-
gatory.

Exchange          tagmemes              are manifested by Verbal Exch$nge Para-
graphs.
   In Dialogue Paragraphs in which more than one Exchange
occurs the change of speaker is optionally introduced by a or e
or by a vocative.   In cases where a question is answered there is
rarely any indication of change of speaker and no quote formulas
occur between the question and the answer.
   As might be expected, deep and surface structure can be out
of phase.  A Direct Quote Sentence which in its initial clause is
Speech, optionally adds a Speech, or Speechy in following clauses.

ture as Final Clauses.    The verb of a Medial Clause is either
past or nonpast.    Past medial verbs occur in sentences in which
the final verb is in one of the past tenses.  Medial verbs in the
past are formed by adding a medial suffix to the final verb with a
past or past continuous suffix or to the Durative Adverb    which
follows the past durative verb.    The person of the medial suffix
must agree with the person of the verbal suffixes and the Dura-
tive Adverb.
    Nonpast Medial Verbs have their own set of suffixes which
indicate person and a temporal relationship with the following
clause. They occur in sentences in which the final verb is pre-
sent, future, or imperative.","[162, 163, 164]"

     8.2. Hortatory Discourse.   A Hortatory Discourse is char-
acterized by the imperative tense and second or third person
plural,   New paragraphs are indicated by endi ‘now’,    sentence
topic,     den     ‘also’,        or a vocative.         Result and Reason construc-
tions are common.    Optional conjunctions in these constructions
are used quite frequently in Hortatory Discourse.
    In the eight Hortatory              Discourses          studied the obligatory
Point tagmeme            occurred       from     two     to nine times.    Optional   tag-
memes,      Aperture (which usually includes a vocative) and Intro-
duction,    precede the Point. Following the nucleus four optional
tagmemes occur: Request, Conclusion, Appeal, and Finis.
Three of these postnuclear tagmemes have been observed to co-
occur.  The Finis is a formulaic sentence or phrase.

   In one Discourse      the Appeal   and Finis were in reverse     order.
    In one text the Aperture,     Point,     and Point, were one phono-
logical sentence.
    The most predominant tense is the imperative, but non-
past successive medial verbs and future tense occur frequently.
    Second and third person plural are the most predominant
person suffixes used,   These usually indicate a ‘general’ person
rather than specific individuals.
     A new tagmeme is marked by the following lexical features
which are listed according to their usage, most frequent to least
frequent:
   (1)   Endi    ‘now’
   (2)   New subject matter introduced by a sentence topic or a
         free subject tagmeme expounded either by a noun or pro-
         noun in the initial clause of the tagmeme. Thereafter in
         that tagmeme the subject is marked only in the verbal
         person/tense suffixes.
   (3)   Den ‘also’
   (4)   Vocative - usually a group vocative
   (5)   Dotouen/Nop dotouen ‘It arrived/the word arrived’.
         Since the introduction of the Local Government Council
         where the interpreter uses dotouen or nop dotouen to
         introduce a new point, these are being used in the village
         to introduce a new tagmeme.
   (6)   Waiangina ‘that’s what I say’ occurred only once, but the
          informant felt it functioned the same as endi ‘now’.","[403, 404, 405]"

(b)    Ao boen literally means    ‘up died’, which means the fingers

      derived from ao-na-gaet ‘up-my-int = only my upper (append-
      ages)’ but this is the only occurrence of intimate possessive

   6.1. Periphery.  Sentence periphery          includes three prenuclear
tagmemes and one postnuclear tagmeme.            Tagmemes which pre-
cede the sentence nucleus are Exclamation,         Vocative,   and Sentence
Topic.   Any two co-occur in the order listed.         The postnuclear
periphery contains the Afterthought tagmeme.
      Exclamations   are such attention getting devices     as 0,   e,   a,   or
emotive expressions like akae ‘(displeasure)’,         kae ‘oh’, ae ‘no’.
The exclamatory vowels are used in quoted dialogue to indicate
change of speaker. The presence of the vowel indicates a new
speaker.  Conjunctions menan ‘therefore’, iwa ‘because’, go ‘but’
and boge ‘immediately’ which serve as internal linkage in the
paragraph occur in the same position and are mutually exclusive
with exclamations.  Conjunctions and other indicators of a new
paragraph also occur in this position and are mutually exclusive
with exclamations.
      Vocative includes all personal names,      kinship terms,     enda
‘friend’   and group addressing forms      as oru ma   ‘fellows’,    inan
maman tatan goanin ‘mothers,        fathers,   older and younger siblings’,
tasin ‘brothers’.
    The Sentence Topic always occurs next to the nucleus and is
expounded by an equational clause or noun phrase.  New points in

                tell-them-2p/imp
      ‘Now make sure you tell them on the other side of the Bantut.’     Points which have been forgotten in the clause are included in
the postnuclear position.    Possibly the Afterthought is used for
emphasis.     In a few examples the Afterthought was preceded by a
final intonation, making the Afterthought a complete phonological
sentence.    Only phrases or equational clauses fill the Afterthought.
In some examples these Afterthoughts are fulfilling paragraph or
discourse requirements.      In narrative discourse it is not unusual
to introduce new dramatis personae or locale using an equational
clause as an Afterthought.     Expository discourses optionally close
with ap anega ‘so thus’ which optionally is included in the into-
nation of the final sentence of the discourse.                           This takes the place
of the more formulaic                closure usually used.","[168, 169, 170]"

    (5) The Process Verb Phrase consists of two obligatory
Action tagmemes.      In this verb phrase, one or two verb stems
and no more occur in combination with a fully inflected verb.     The
phrase functions as a close-knit unit of two or more words in that
the series of actions constitutes a composite action with amalga-
mated meaning.     Since this is true, certain semantic restrictions
are placed upon the fillers of the Action tagmemes.     The Process
Verb Phrase fills the Head of the General and Qualified Verb
Phrases.   The verb manifesting the second Action determines if
the phrase occurs in the Predicate of Ditransitive,                Transitive,   or
Intransitive        Clauses.","[135, 136, 137, 138]"

lists twenty sentence nuclei.   Sentence periphery optionally occur
with any of these nuclear constructions.    The chart serves to or-
ganize the presentation and to give major contrastive features
between the various sentence types.     There are no parameters to
the chart.
    The five sentences of each column will be described in order
from the top of the column to the bottom.

    In some examples the tenses used indicate one type of sen-
tence but the conjunctions used indicate another type.    In such
cases the conjunction takes precedence and indicates the sentence
type.   If tense restrictions indicate one sentence type (e.g., past
followed by past indicates a Coordinate Sentence) and another sen-
tence type is desired, the conjunction is obligatory (i.e.,                     past
menan ‘therefore’ past indicates a Result Sentence).
   The chart lists the name of the sentence type followed by the
number of obligatory tagmemes and optional tagmemes that are
possible.   Any conjunction which occurs is listed next.  Most of
the conjunctions are optional, but these optional conjunctions have
not been included in the count of optional tagmemes which is just
above the conjunction.         Any other unusual features of the sentence
are then listed.    Finally tense       restrictions         are given.","[183, 184, 185, 186]"

    The conjunction ge ‘and’ occurs in about one-third of the
examples,    If the conjunction is used it usually occurs between
all the Heads.    It is more likely for the conjunction to be used in
a Coordinate Phrase with two Heads than in a Coordinate phrase
with multiple Heads.
    The Summary             is more     likely to occur in a phrase with multi-
ple Heads.
     Coordinate Phrases are divided into subtypes by the fillers
of the Head tagmemes.   There are Coordinate Noun Phrases,
Coordinate Location Phrases, and Coordinate Temporal Phrases.
The Coordinate Noun Phrase fills the Subject, Object, and In-
direct Object tagmemes of the clause.    It also manifests the Axis
of Purpose and Location Phrases.    The Coordinate Location
Phrase fills the Location tagmeme.    The Coordinate Temporal
Phrase occurs in the Time tagmeme.","[109, 110]"

Special Features:
(a)    Usually Result Paragraphs expound other paragraph-level
      tagmemes.     The example which had the optional peripheral
      tagmemes expounded an Episode tagmeme in a Narrative Dis-
      course.   In two other examples the Result Paragraph ex-
      pounded the Conclusion tagmeme of the Hortatory and Narra-
      tive Discourses.    One Result Paragraph expounded a Point
      tagmeme       in a Hortatory Discourse.
(b)    A Setting and a Terminus                expounded by Simple Sentences
      occurred in one example.                 This example also contained the
      Link.
(c)     The Link menan is obligatory when the same                      tense occurs
      in the Cause and in the Effect.
(f)   The deep structure of Causation optionally is encoded as a
      Result Paragraph or as a Narrative Paragraph in which the
      Link menan does not occur and in which the same tense
      occurs in two successive Steps.","[347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353]"

Special Features:
(a)       When a verb phrase manifests the Head,                      the final verb of that
      phrase       must be uninflected.
(b)       The    adjectives     or the few     nouns   which     occur    in the   Qualitative

(c)       Tense,     aspect,    person,      and number suffixes occur on the
      filler of the Qualitative tagmeme.      ta        otu-m-ivin                             tunu)        amun-am-ivin

      ‘He is sleeping well.’                               ‘We corrected the speech.’          (2) The Object Focus Verb Phrase consists of two obligatory
Head tagmemes.                 It occurs in the Head of the General Verb
Phrase and in the Predicate of Transitive Clauses.  In some in-
stances the Object Focus Phrase handles the benefactive area of
meaning.","[131, 132]"
"     (2) There are three stems which do not conform to the above
rules; when followed by a consonant the stem-final morphopho-
neme is lost.    unuG           +   -nege       +       -en               =   ununegen

    (3) All stems ending in consonants other than G, R,                             S,   and
W add /a/ when followed by a consonant-initial suffix.    en            +          -ne       +         -en        =    enanen
    put/in                    us               3s/p              ‘he put us in’
    (4) The final consonant of prefixes in affix-derived stems
assimilates in point of articulation to the contiguous root-initial
consonant.     em~benag~en
     stick-tear-ls/p
     ‘I stuck into and tore (it)’
     en-dum~an
     stick-split-ls/p
     ‘I stuck into and split (it)’    (5)    When       a morpheme-initial /w/                is preceded    by a back

     3.4.3.      Irregular Verbs.         There     are four irregular verbs      in
Daga:       aG   ‘go’,   onaG   ‘come’,     waniG      ‘stay’,     and geaG   ‘fall’.
These verbs are irregular in that person is marked on the stem
so that there is a different stem for each of the six persons.
These irregular stems expound the Stem tagmeme of the Intran-
sitive Verb Endocenter and occur with any of the forms of the
verb exocenter,    The simple past paradigm will be given of each
of the irregular verbs to illustrate the stem allomorphs.    The
person of the stem must agree with all other subject persons in-
dicated in the verb.

pletely reduplicated.   Generally, reduplication in verbal forms
indicates a repetition of the action; in nouns it indicates a plural-
 ization.
     Various subclasses of reduplication occur: complete redupli-
cation, reduplication with one vowel change, reduplication with
two vowel changes, and reduplication of one or two syllables.
    The reduplicated form fills the same                   tagmeme      that the unre-
duplicated form fills.","[87, 88, 89, 90]"
"     (10) Temporals fill the Head tagmeme of Temporal Phrases.
A few Temporals take suffixes; those which optionally take a
suffix are shown in the subclasses.    A few Temporals act like
nouns in that they optionally are possessed, but do not act like
nouns in that they do not fill the same slots as nouns. Some Tem-
porals are stereotyped clauses.

      Stereotyped     clauses which           act as Temporals:
     One solution would be to consider that these stereotyped
 clauses are manifesting sentence-level tagmemes, either Base,
 of the Coordinate Sentence if a final verb occurs in the clause
 or Action of the Sequence Sentence if a medial verb occurs in the
 clause. This analysis, however, was rejected because the stereo-
 typed clause acts as a single temporal                  in indicating a new para-
 graph in Narrative Discourse.

"    3.4.2.1. The Verb Endocenter is made up of the stem, the
prefix, and the first order suffixes. The endocenter determines
the transitivity of the verb. The object person, intensive, and
exhaustive are mutually exclusive first order suffixes.  Intran-
sitive stems occur only with the intensive or exhaustive suffixes.
Transitive stems occur with these two and also with the object
person suffix.  Ditransitive stems occur with an indirect object
person prefix and with the exhaustive suffix.
    (1) The Ditransitive Verb Endocenter consists of the obliga-
tory Indirect Object Person prefix and Stem followed by the
optional Endocenter Suffix.

"     Linkage within the paragraph in the Hortatory Discourse is
predominantly by use of the optional conjunctions which occur in
the prenuclear periphery of the sentence which is being linked to
the preceding sentence or embedded paragraph.       Some recapitu-
lation occurs.   Implicational linkage in which the optional con-
junction does not occur is used especially when iwa ‘because’
is implied.   In one discourse of seven paragraphs three of these
were Reason Paragraphs in which iwa ‘because’ did not occur.
    Eleven      rhetorical questions were    scattered   among four of the
six Hortatory Discourses studied,          compared with one rhetorical
question in a Procedural Discourse and none elsewhere.     No
formal features distinguish the rhetorical question from the
question word type of question except that no answer is given.

Only two examples   occurred   with the sentence-final intonation,
one in Hortatory Discourse and the other in a Procedural Dis-
course.    Perhaps further data will show that the non-sentence-
final intonation plus no answer expected will distinguish rhetori~
cal questions from other types of questions.
    In one discourse urging the people to work on the airstrip,
the command to go to the airstrip was never stated.    In four
sentences ellipsis of the predicate (that particular command)
occurred.

all the final tenses except durative have been observed in the data.
This particular gap in the data is no doubt caused by the small
sample.     Logically, any tense should be useable since the speaker
usually backs up his commands with reasons and results that
necessarily need to be expressed in the various final tenses.
     Person suffixes in the Hortatory Discourse are usually in one
of the three plural persons.   In some instances the speaker uses
first person plural to mean first person singular,   The message
is softened at times by using the third person plural imperative
to mean the second person plural imperative.     At times the first
person plural is used to mean the second person plural.     One
text was addressed to an individual so second person singular
was used.   Further data may reveal that Hortatory Discourse can
be divided into Group and Individual Hortatory Discourses depend-
ing on the intended audience.  The one text addressed to the indi-
vidual seemed less formal.
    Since this analysis was prepared additional Hortatory Dis-
courses have been heard.    These have agreed with the analysis
as presented.   Because of various circumstances they were not
recorded on tape.

of three tagmemes, the Item, Itemg, and the Substantive Marker.
It expounds Subject, Object, and Indirect Object tagmemes.    On
the phrase level the Substantive Phrase expounds the Referent
tagmeme of the Possessive Phrase, the Head of the Coordinate
Noun Phrase, the Axis of Purpose and Location Phrases, and
both Item and Apposition in the Appositional Noun Phrase. In
addition, the Sentence Topic (a sentence peripheral tagmeme)
is filled by the Substantive    Phrase.","[104, 105]"
"      (5)   Referents.      One   sentence    is also   bound     to another   by the
use of a referent.          Ap mepe       ‘there’   and ame       ‘that one’     are
used to refer back to a place or person mentioned in a previous
sentence.   Possessive pronouns also refer back to a previous
sentence for clarification as to the possessor.

    (6) In Hortatory Discourse a common way to bind a paragraph
together is to introduce the matter under discussion by means of
a sentence topic in the periphery of the initial sentence of the para-
graph.    Thereafter the matter under discussion is not mentioned
overtly again in the paragraph.","[310, 311]"
