8.3.4. Case marking verbs  Supyire does not extensively use serial verbs as case markers in the way
common in many other West African languages (cf. Givön 1975, Lord 1973,
1989). In fact only three verbs are regularly so used. A few other verbs seem
to be on the verge of developing such a function. One such verb is two
'take', which is extremely common as VI, and which could develop into an
accusative marker with the proper encouragement. I have found no examples
so far, however, in which it did not retain its original basic sense of taking
something in one's hands. The verbs treated below, however, have indisput-
ably developed a case marking function.",[319]
"
6.1.2. Post-head       determinersThe three major types of post-head determiner all signal less-than-definite
reference. In one type the reference is unknown by the hearer, in another it
is unknown by the speaker, and in the third it requires an additional compu-
tation beyond that necessary to establish the reference indicated by a simple
definite determiner.
                                                         6.1. Determiners   195
6.1.2.1. Indefinite/partitive and indefinite 'other'Like all the other determiners, the indefinite determiners (for the forms, see
chapter 5, section 5.1.2.4) normally require a definite head noun. The noun
phrase as a whole, however, is indefinite.  (12) a. pücwd-rji           wä
           girl-DEF(GlS) IND(GIS)
           'a (certain) girl'
        b. cyde-bii                 pi)
           women-DEF(G 1P)IND(G 1P)
           'some women'
        c. ku-ni               la
           road-DEF(G3S) IND(G3S)
           'a (certain) road'
        d. kya-ä-re                  tä
           chew-G4-DEF(G4) IND(G4)
           'some meat'  It could well be asked why such a complex form is needed when the noun
in its indefinite form (i.e. with the basic gender suffix only) would do as
well. The answer lies in the domain of referentiality. Simple indefinite nouns
can be either referential or non-referential. In the former case, they are often
of low discourse topicality. The more complex construction with an indefi-
nite determiner, when used in a non-partitive sense in an affirmative clause,
is referential, and moreover, participants introduced in this way tend to be
highly topical. One can therefore say that the simple noun is often non-refer-
ential from a pragmatic point of view, and that one major function of the in-
definite determiner is to code referential indefinites of importance in the dis-
course. The indefinite determiner or pronoun basically instructs the hearer
not to search the environment or the preceding discourse for a referent, but
rather to store the information for future reference.
  The indefinite determiner may also be used with partitive meaning. In this
case the determiner does not need to agree in number with the head, but only
in gender. That is, a singular determiner may follow a plural head, as in the
following examples:  (13) a .pi       cien-bif                      wä
            their younger.siblings-DEF(GIP)IND(GIS)
            'one of their younger siblings'
        b. wüu wä
           we    IND(GIS)
           'one of us'
196   Chapter 6: Noun phrasesAs the latter example shows, the head of an indefinite determiner may be a
pronoun. Some examples with third person pronoun heads are: (14) a. Kä u ύ        1j-kär6
         and he NARR IP-go
         'Then he went
           mäsäkwü      kbb-g6        k&       e,
           sweet.potatofield-DEF(G2S) IND(G2S) in
           into a sweet potato field,
           mä sä uru           wä       kün.
           and go it(EMPH.GlS) IND(GIS) crunch
           and ate one.'
        b. Mbdömbää-yimäha käri-gii             punf      pyi,
           discord-DEF HAB things-DEF(G3P) all            do
           'Discord does all (sorts of) things,
           $kää Ii       lä         /Jye ηϊβοεηηε me.
           but   it(G3S) IND(G3S) be good.G3S NEG
           but not one (of them) is good/  The last example above illustrates a further point that should be made. In
most cases in affirmative, realis clauses, the noun phrase containing an in-
definite determiner is referential, but this is not the case in negative and ir-
realis clauses, where such a noun phrase usually must be understood to be
non-referential.
  As stated above, the head noun ordinarily takes the definite suffix even
with the indefinite determiner. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule
however, in which the head noun is indefinite. One is the common time
phrase cant) kä 'one day 1 , much used in narratives. The more regular cängke
kä is possible, but rarely heard. Another exception is found in the subject of
an exclamatory clause with a deictic identifier pronoun as predicate. In some
cases this seems to have a slightly pejorative force, as in the following ex-
ample: (15) Pyä wä           wdf
      child IND(GIS) it.is(GlS)
      'What a (troublesome) child! (lit. Here's a child!)'  It should be noted that the ambiguity occasioned by the dual function pro-
noun/determiner together with the similar word order of genitive and pre-
head determiner is naturally absent for post-head determiners. When these
occur before a noun, they must be interpreted as (genitive) pronouns. The
head (possessed) noun in this case must be in the indefinite form:
                                                         6.1. Determiners   19 7 (16) a. wä        pyä
         IND(GIS) child
         'someone's child*
       b. wä        jwü-mü
          IND(GIS) say-G5
          'someone's words'Of course a head noun plus indefinite determiner may be a genitive noun
phrase, in which case the determiner is sandwiched between the nouns. The
possessed noun must still be indefinite: (17) a. nä-gi           wä           cwd
         man-DEF(GlS)                 IND(GIS)           wife
         'a (certain) man's wife'
        b. ced-i7/             wä      ba-ga
           woman-DEF(G 1S) IND(G 1S) house-G2S
           'a (certain) woman's house'  The indefinite 'other' determiners (see chapter 5, section 5.1.2.5 for the
forms) differ from the indefinite determiners/pronouns in having antecedents
of sorts, perhaps better described as ""alterantecedents"". That is, the indefi-
nite 'other* means ""another of the category mentioned before"". For example,
when one woman has already been mentioned, another may be introduced
with the phrase: (18) ced-qi          wä-bire
      woman-DEF(G 1 S)IND(G 1 S)-OTHER
      'another woman'Examples from other genders are: (19) a. mobili-ge       kä-biri
         car-DEF(G2S) IND(G2S)-OTHER
         'another truck'
        b. yacS-ni          lä-beri
           belly-DEF(G3S) IND(G3S)-OTHER
           'another pregnancy'
        c. käri-gif         cO-bäri
           affairs-DEF(G3P) IND(G3P)-OTHER
           'other affairs'  Like the simple indefinites, the indefinite 'other' forms can be used as pro-
nouns. In the following example, the ""alterantecedent"" is in the same sen-
tence:
198   Chapter 6: Noun phrases

        HAB go hide      IND(G2S)-OTHER in
        and go hide in another. 1
6.1.2.2. Interrogative determinersThe interrogative and emphatic interrogative determiners (see chapter 5, sec-
tions 5.1.2.9 and 5.1.2.10 for the forms) are 'indefinite* in the sense that the
speaker does not know the reference, but assumes that the hearer does. As
with the indefinite determiners, the head noun takes a definite suffix. For a
description of the use of these determiners as well as examples, see chapter
14, section 14.2.2.6.","[217, 218, 219, 220, 221]"
"  When an adjective modifies a coordinate noun phrase, it also agrees only
with the final conjunct. Note how gender 3 is used in the following example,
even though the first conjunct is gender 1 and both refer to human beings:  (126)   Mu ä        cee-we      nä päc06blld
          you PERF woman-GIS and girl.little.G3S

                              Simple clauses
In this chapter the structure of simple (non-complex) clauses will be de-
scribed. Simple clauses fall into three basic categories based on the type of
predicate they have: those with pronominal predicates (identifier pronouns),
those with copular predicates, and those with verbal predicates. Aside from
this basic categorization, verbal clauses can further be subclassified accord-
ing to the semantic and pragmatic nominal roles (""cases"") that they have.
  After an initial section dealing with the order of constituents in a simple
clause, each of the above categories will be described in turn. The final
category (verbal clauses) comprises by far the greatest variety of subtypes,
and will consequently occupy the bulk of this chapter. The chapter con-
cludes with a section on optional nominal case roles and another on adverbs.","[259, 260]"

10.1. Transitivity in Supyire
From a purely structural point of view, it is easy to distinguish transitive
from intransitive sentences in Supyire merely by the presence versus the ab-
sence of a direct object. Subjects and direct objects are easily distinguish-
able by their fixed position in the sentence. 1 It is now generally agreed,
however, that a merely structural account of transitivity is hopelessly inade-
quate. As a means of making cross-linguistic generalizations, categories
such as subject and direct object run into all sorts of difficulties, since a
structural definition valid for one language is often not applicable to another.
There is a considerable literature on this topic (see in particular Keenan
1976, Hopper and Thompson 1980, Givön 1984, 1989, DeLancey 1987).
Two major points have been established in this literature. The first is that
transitivity from a functional point of view is a scalar phenomenon and not a
binary one. The second is that to gain a clear picture of what the function of
a given syntactic role is, one must take into account both semantic and
pragmatic factors.
  Assuming the correctness of this approach, what can be said of the roles of
subject and direct object in Kampwo Supyire? The subject is a largely prag-
matic role, just as it is in languages like English and French (see Giv6n
1983, 1984: 139). This means that one cannot simply equate the syntactic
role of subject with a semantic role such as agent. The subject of a clause
can in fact also be the semantic patient, recipient, or even some other role.
The choice of which semantic role is to be subject is a pragmatic one. Hav-
ing said this, it is necessary to affirm that the hierarchy of ""accessibility"" to
400   Chapter 10: Transitivity and voicesubject (see Keenan 1976, Keenan and Comrie 1977, Givön 1984) which has
been found valid for other languages is also valid for Supyire:  (1) Agent    >   Recipient >      Patient >   OtherAccording to this hierarchy, subjects are more likely to be agents than they
are to be any of the other roles. From a pragmatic point of view, of course,
agents tend to be more interesting and relevant, and are therefore better
candidates on the whole for the position of subject.
  The choice of direct object, in contrast, is largely semantic: it is almost
always the patient. This sets Supyire apart from languages such as English
which freely allow recipients, and sometimes even roles lower on the hierar-
chy, such as instrumental or locative, to be ""promoted"" to direct object (the
so-called ""dative shift"" rule). In such languages the direct object can be de-
fined in pragmatic terms as a secondary clause-level topic. Supyire allows
dative shift with only one verb, kan 'give', which may be characterized as
the prototypical three-participant verb, and whose equivalents in other lan-
guages are cross-linguistically the most likely to allow recipient direct ob-
jects. Most often when the recipient is made the direct object of kan the pa-
tient is suppressed altogether. It is, however, possible to include the patient
as an indirect object marked with the postposition na 'on, at': 2  (2) Mli a       ύ   kan bikf3 ηά.
      I   PERF him give pen at
      Ί have given him a pen.'","[422, 423]"
"
2.1.1.3. GlottalizationThe conversion of /g/ to [?] has already been mentioned. Several
grammatical morphemes exhibit an alternation between /g/ (or [R]) and [?].
In some cases the glottal form is at least partially predictable, as in the
gender 3 plural noun suffix -gilisee chapter 3, section 3.1.1.13). In others it
is lexicalized with certain roots, as in the case of the gender 2 singular suffix
-gV{see chapter 3, section 3.1.1.7).
  The alternation of the conditional auxiliary kä with the voiced variant gä
was discussed above. This auxiliary also has a variant -hä ([?a]) which is
obligatory following simple non-demonstrative pronouns. In the case of the
first and second person and third person gender 1, the vowel of the pronoun
is diphthongized (for details see section 2.2.1.1 below). The other class pro-
nouns (genders 2-5) all replace their vowels with [a]. The pronoun and con-
ditional auxiliary together form a 'CVCV foot. Some examples of this combi-
nation are:
                                                              2.1. Consonants 13 (9) mu              kä                 Mu ahä fwöro...        ['mwa?i] 9
     you             COND               'If you go out...'
      mii            kä                 Mii ähä fwöro...        ['my|?ä]
      I                                 'If I go out...'
      υ              kä                 U ahä fwöro...          ['wa?ä]
      G1S                               'If s/he/it goes out...
      ku             kä                 Ka hä fwöro...          ['ka?ä]
      G2S                               'If it goes out...'","[35, 36]"
"15. There is a large body of literature on so-called ""indirect speech acts"".
    See in particular Brown and Levinson (1978), Levinson (1983), and the
    comments in Givön (1990, chapter 18).
16. The form of this question is highly unusual. The interrogative deter-
    miner obviously belongs with the initial noun phrase, but is separated
    from it by the rest of the clause. No other example of this sort occurs in
    the corpus, nor was I able to induce anyone into producing parallel
    examples. Pücirii are members of ones patrician who have been mar-
    ried. Since most villages consist only of members of one patrician plus
    their wives (children belong automatically to their father's patrician),
    and since the clans are exogamous (at least in theory), the adult female
    members of one's patrician usually reside in another village. On the
    verb wyisee chapter 13, note 5.

2.  Kile is the creator Sky-God. This example is taken from a folktale in
    which monkey decides to eat a human being, but determines to do it in a
    dense thicket where he is not able to see the sky when he looks up (and
    consequently the sky/God cannot see his evil deed).
3. For the use of the conditional in a relative clause, see chapter 13, sec-
    tion 13.4.2.
4. See Thompson and Longacre 1985:204f for a discussion of the phe-
    nomenon of extensive borrowing of subordinating morphemes. Such
    borrowing seems to be at least as extensive in Supyire as in the two
    Mexican languages cited by Thompson and Longacre: Yaqui and Isth-
    mus Zapotec.
5. These are common names of dogs, borrowed from Bambara.
6. See chapter 9, note 12.
7. Compare also the use of 'and' to mark conditionals in early modern
    English.
8. Dügüsön 'village festival' is borrowed from Bambara dügü 'village,
    town' and son 'worship, offer sacrifices'. The Supyire term is käsunno
    (from känhä 'village' + sun 'offer sacrifices', borrowed from the Bam-
    bara verb above). The denotatum is an annual festival to thank the tute-
    lary spirits of the village (the 'jinns') for favors during the past year and
    to pray for the coming year.
9. Bäärä 'work' is borrowed from Bambara baara 'work'.
10. This seems to be a caique on the Bambara conjunctive phrase ο bee n'a
    ta 'this all and its own'.
11. ΚίΙέ'wrench' is borrowed from French c/e/'wrench'.
12. Mekanishyingiri 'mechanics, repair work' is formed from mekanishyen
    'mechanic' (borrowed from French m6canicieti) by the addition of a
    syllable of unknown origin (plus the gender 4 suffix -rV).
13. Note the similar placement of the conjunction de in ancient Greek,
    which has a comparable function.
14. IJkää is underlyingly /hkälä/. The origin of the extra syllable [la], not
    found in the standard Bambara form hka, is at present unknown.
15. Y5 is the Supyire equivalent of the ubiquitous ο found in many if not
    most West African languages. See Singler (1988).
16. This is evidently an archaic use of the conjunction kä, which in ordinary
    language is used as a different subject narrative connective, and cannot
    be combined as here with an imperfective verb without any auxiliary.
    The current function as a different subject marker accords well with an
    etymology pointing to an earlier function as a marker of disjunction.
    The archaic nature of the present example is due to its being a proverb.
17. See chapter 13, note 7.

Chapter 12: Focus and topic constructions1.    The absence of any copula in the affirmative, and the absence of any
      relative clause morphology or syntax, makes the ""cleft"" look very much
      like Y-movement. The construction seems in fact to cover the pragmatic
      functions of both clefts and Y-movement (i.e. both strong and somewhat
      weaker contrast). I have chosen to label it cleft because of the use of a
      copular element in the negative, and because of the use of a place-hold-
      ing pronoun when the subject is focused. As pointed out by Givön
      (1990, chapter 16), in a subject initial language (like English or Supy-
      ire) a true Y-movement construction should not be able to code focus on
      the subject, since it is already in initial position.
2.    On the face of it this contradicts some predictions based on the
      ""accessibility hierarchy"" (see Keenan and Comrie 1977, Keenan 1985).
      Pronoun retention is typically lower on the hierarchy than gapping.
      Supyire is thus unusual in using pronoun retention with subject, which
      is the highest point on the hierarchy, and gapping with direct object,
      which is lower. Because of the peculiar word order of the Senufo lan-
                                                        Notes: Chapter 12   731     guages (with an auxiliary between the subject and direct object), gap-
     ping is an ideal strategy for direct object, but not at all for subject.
3.   Ordinarily a direct object consisting of a simple anaphoric pronoun
     should take the (floating) low tone of the perfect auxiliary. The reasons
     why it does not do so in this example (and a handful of others) are un-
     clear, but probably have something to do with the exclamatory nature of
     the utterance.
4.   The basic meaning of wyere (definite wyeire) is 'leaves'. Herbalist
     practices have led to the extension of the word to cover both 'medicine'
     and 'poison', as here.
5.   Lakyärä is borrowed from Bambara lakari 'antidote'.
6.   Säsä is an intensifier that occurs only with ηά/ηέ 'now'. The combina-
     tion means 'right now', 'this instant'. Its use by the speaker of the ex-
     ample is an exaggeration, since the person referred to had died several
     months previously.
7.   The high tone on the subject pronoun is also found in the realis (high
     tone) complement clause type (see chapter 11, section 11.3). The high-
     low tune on the identifier pronoun is surprising, since normally these
     pronouns, which have a strong mid basic tune, simply allow a preceding
     high to spread onto them, wiping out the mid tone. The source of the fi-
     nal low remains unexplained at present.
8.   The genitive particle in a few cases is not used for focus as in the above
     examples, but to show that a genitive construction is intended in certain
     cases where there could be another interpretation. Thus, since some-
     times adjectives can be used substantially, occasionally the combina-
     tion noun + adjective could actually be intended to be genitive + noun.
     The following phrase could thus have the two meanings indicated:        Dähä nin-jwogi
        Daha ADJ-take.DEF(GlS)
        a. 'Daha taken' (e.g. in Ί saw Daha taken from the room.')
        b. 'Daha's taking' i.e. his salary     The use of the genitive particle unambiguously forces the second inter-
     pretation, but does not necessarily indicate any focus on the genitive
     noun:        Dähä ' ύ        nin-jwoiji
        Daha GEN ADJ-take.DEF(GlS)
        'Daha's salary'     A difficulty of another sort arises in participial nominalizations in which
     the deverbal adjective is accompanied by an adpositional phrase. Since
     the adpositional phrase intervenes between the genitive and its head, the
732    Notes: Chapter 13      only way to show that a genitive construction is intended is to insert the
      genitive particle in front of the head noun:         pddrji      nu-vworogi       lwoh6     e
         catfish.DEF ADJ-come.out.DEF water.DEF from
         υ    tunmp6
         GEN noise.DEF
         'the noise of the catfish coming out of the water'    Here again there is no hint of any kind of special focus. A possible ex-
    planation of the distribution of functions of the genitive particle may be
    that it was formerly used in all genitive constructions, but was subse-
    quently lost in ordinary genitives. It was retained in those cases where it
    was necessary to indicate that a genitive construction was intended, and
    also in those cases where there was a special focus (accompanied by in-
    tonational stress) on the possessor noun phrase.
9. This does not hold for left dislocated time phrases. See below for exam-
    ples of these.
10. The cicahagikii are dried gourds with the seeds still inside them. They
    are played by a chorus of women who sing to their own accompani-

    is entirely appropriate for a percussion instrument.
11. Part of the funeral celebration is a Mast dance' for the deceased, in
    which the body is danced through the village by six young men.","[753, 754, 755]"
"  All relative clauses in Supyire, then, are restrictive. They serve to restrict
the reference or interpretation of the noun they modify (though see below on
488   Chapter 13: Relative clauses""afterthought"" relatives). In the most typical case, the speaker provides in-
formation in the relative clause which allows the addressee to uniquely iden-
tify the referent of the modified noun. In order to accomplish this function,
the information provided must be about the referent, and must be known to
or inferable by the addressee. Relative clauses thus contain a noun phrase
which is coreferential with the noun phrase being modified in the main
clause, and the information they contain is most often treated as presupposed
by speakers (cf. Givdn 1990, chapter 15).1 It is not surprising that such
clauses share basic characteristics with cleft focus constructions and the
commonest type of constituent questions, both of which consist of an initial
noun phrase followed by a clause containing presupposed information. Nei-
ther of these constructions derive historically from the present day relative
clause construction, however.
   Relative clauses in Supyire are unembedded. 2 The most typical variety,
with definite, referential heads, are preposed to the main clause. The relative
clause is terminated by the clause final relative marker k6, frequently voiced
to g6, and is typically followed by a short pause before the main clause. 3 (2) Yaag6      ka a       ύ   bd k6,    mu a  kürü   c6.
     thing.DEF it PERF him kill REL you PERF it(EMPH) know
     'The thing that killed him, you know it.'
      Freely: 'You know the thing that killed him'The etymology of k6 is not certain, but it is undoubtedly related to the loca-
tive question marker of the identical form k6 (see chapter 14, section
14.2.2.7). A connection between a locative question word or marker and the
relative clause marker is attested in a number of languages (see Givön
1990b, where Krio, modern Greek, southern colloquial German, and Bam-
bara are cited). Both the relative k6 and the interrogative k6 are quite likely
derived from the gender 2 singular demonstrative r)k6. The corresponding
relative marker in Cebaara is      which is probably derived from the gender
3 singular demonstrative tee. In Cebaara the marker is generally placed after
the verb rather than at the end of the relative clause. This placement and the
demonstrative etymology can be taken as indications that the markers had a
nominalizing function originally.
  As noted above, in the canonical relative clause construction there are two
coreferential noun phrases, one in the relative clause and one in the main
clause. The first of these we will call the ""relativized noun phrase"". It is in
some respects like the ""head"" noun phrase in a language like English, since
it comes first in the construction and is more fully specified. The noun
phrase in the following main clause, which is typically pronominalized, will
be labeled simply as the ""coreferential noun phrase"". The relativized noun
phrase is most frequently placed at the beginning of the relative clause, and
may or may not be additionally marked with an ordinary demonstrative or
                        13.1. Basic structure and function of relative clauses   489with a relative determiner. The coreferential noun phrase typically takes the
form of an emphatic pronoun (e.g. uru, pire, etc.; see section 13.3 below for
a discussion of the use of these pronouns), and occurs in the position it
would normally take in the clause (that is, it is most often not focused). The
following example (as well as the previous one) illustrates all these features.
In it the relativized noun phrase is the subject of the relative clause, and the
coreferential noun phrase is likewise the subject of the main clause: (3) Pücwdgi         u          jjye ηά mu f ke,
     girl.DEF(GlS) she(GlS) be with you with REL
     'The girl who is with you,
      uru            si ή-kwü.
      she(EMPH.GlS) FUT FP-die
      she will die.'
      Freely: 'The girl who is with you will die.'","[510, 511, 512]"
"  ""Semi-embedding"" as illustrated in the above examples cannot simply be
dismissed as ""performance"" errors. They are not examples of restarting a
sentence in midstream. Speakers do not regard them in any way as odd or in-
elegant, and willingly supply additional examples.
  It appears, then, that this type of construction represents the beginning of a
process which may end in the full embedding of relative clauses. In the pre-
sent state of the language, however, relative clauses are like the complement
clauses in being neither embedded nor independent. Like complement
clauses, they are marked as subordinate by a specific morpheme, in this case
the relative clause marker k6. Internally they are further marked by either
the fronting of the relativized noun phrase or the use of a relative pro-

that the relative clause cannot simply be analyzed as some sort of topic
clause adjoined by simple parataxis to another independent clause.

                      Non-declarative speech acts
Most if not all languages distinguish three major sentence types: declarative,
imperative, and interrogative (Sadock and Zwicky 1985). Supyire, in com-
mon with all the Senufo languages, conforms to this generalization. The bulk
of this grammar is devoted to declaratives, in conformity with descriptive
tradition. This tradition is probably due to the twin factors of the greater
text-frequency of declaratives and to the greater degree of syntactic elabora-
tion usually found in declaratives (Givön 1990, chapter 18). This chapter in
contrast is devoted entirely to the description of the other two sentence
types.
  The three major sentence types can be conceived of as grammaticalized
means of performing three major functions of language: to convey informa-
tion (declarative), to give orders, requests, invitations or the like
(imperative), and to elicit information (interrogative). In Supyire, as in many
languages, imperatives are principally distinguished by what they lack
(subject, auxiliary) in comparison to other clause types. There is also one
auxiliary used exclusively in a subtype of imperative. Also dealt with in this
chapter is the use of the subjunctive to accomplish a politer manipulation
than the ""bare"" imperative.
   Questions in Kampwo Supyire are a more marked sentence type than either
imperatives or declaratives. All questions have some sort of interrogative
particle at the end or, in a few cases, at the beginning of the sentence. In ad-
dition, in constituent (""wh"") questions, the use of question words and, in the
majority of questions, the use of the cleft focus construction also mark the
clause as different.
   A further characteristic distinguishing both imperatives and interrogatives
from declaratives is the use of the non-declarative set of first and second
person pronouns (for the form of these pronouns see chapter 5, section
5.1.1.2). These special pronouns are not obligatory in imperatives and ques-
tions, and in fact, ordinary first and second person pronouns are even more
common in these sentence types. Further, the first person singular non-de-
clarative pronoun na cannot be used as subject. On the other hand, the non-
declarative pronouns cannot be used in declarative sentences, except in three
functions: as reflexive genitive possessors (see chapter 6, section 6.2.1), as
genitive possessors in vocatives (first person only), and in exclamations. Ex-
amples of the latter two functions are:
518   Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts (1) a. vocative, genitive possessor

                                 Table 22. Quantifiers
                Type              Quantifier        Gloss               Universal            punf            'all'

                                    jüül)            'many, much'
   Unlike the independent adjectives, but like the cardinal numerals, the
quantifiers do not agree in noun class with the noun they modify. Two of
them {punf and känä) are nominalizations, and one of these has both definite
and indefinite forms (känä / käni).21
   The quantifiers, again like the cardinal numerals, behave tonally like pos-
sessed nouns. If they originated as heads of genitive constructions, then their
lack of agreement with the head noun would follow naturally. At present
none of the quantifiers can be used alone as head of a noun phrase, however,
unlike English a//, for example, in the sentence 'All were present on time.'
   JüüJ) 'many' also functions as the interrogative quantifier 'how many?',
'how much?', and in fact it is most frequently met in that capacity. Its non-
interrogative function is more often filled by the adjectival form nipyahara
'much, many', from the verb jiyaAa 'be much, many'.
   Five of the quantifiers can 'float'. That is, they can be used adverbially,
placed after the verb and separate from any noun phrase. In this use they
may differ quite a bit in meaning from the quantifier use.
   A set of four closely related ""emphatic"" modifiers can be included here
because they behave syntactically like the quantifiers. Etymologically, these
modifiers are denominal. Three of them derive from the gender 3 noun bilini
 'seed' and its plural pyäagif. The other has an otherwise unknown gender 1
172   Chapter 5: Other word classesroot -bä-. In three of the forms the nominal prefix ya- 'thing' is added. The
four forms are:  (34) b)J)nf
       ya-bUini
       ya-pyäagii
       ya-bäyiThese four modifiers can be used interchangeably. The alternation between
singular and plural or between genders 1 and 3 has nothing to with the num-
ber or gender of the head noun they modify. Syntactically they behave like
the quantifiers, viz. like the possessed head of a genitive construction. Se-
mantically they fill roughly the function of the emphatic use of the reflexive
pronouns in English. They have nothing to do with reflexivity per se, how-
ever. Following are two examples of noun phrases with an emphatic modi-
fier, one with a pronoun head, the other with a noun head. The reader is re-
ferred to chapter 6, section 6.3.3.4 for more examples. (35) a. τηΏ yäbWnf

5.5. Adverbs
Except for the ideophones (see below section 5.5.1.2), Supyire does not have
a large class of adverbs. Unlike the adjectives, there is no productive mor-
phological process for forming adverbs from other word classes. Most of the
work done by manner adverbs in languages like English and French is done
by serial verb constructions in Supyire. There is a rich set of verbs used in
such constructions, so that Supyire is certainly not impoverished in its means
in this regard. See chapter 8 for a description of the ""adverbial"" serial verbs.
In a similar vein, Supyire, like most languages, codes adverbial expressions
of location and time mainly as postpositional phrases. These will not be dealt
with in this section, which is concerned only with the class of one word ad-
verbs. For the interrogative adverbs (di 'how?' and taä 'where?'), see sec-
tion 5.9 below.
  The adverbs may be divided into two groups for expository purposes: ad-
verbs of quantity and manner, and adverbs of location and time.
                                                              5.5. Adverbs   1735.5.1. Adverbs of quantity and mannerThe adverbs of quantity and manner fall into two major groupings. The first
(called 'ordinary' for lack of a better label) is a closed class, only nine forms
having been recorded so far. Most of these have etymological connections
with other parts of the vocabulary. The second is a much larger and more
open class: the so-called ""ideophones"" characteristic of West African lan-
guages.","[194, 195, 196]"
"
7.5. Peripheral case roles
In this section we will examine those case roles that are peripheral or
'optional', in the sense that they are not a necessary ingredient of the mental
representation of the events in which they participate. They are instead cir-
cumstancial to specific events. Like nuclear or ""obligatory"" roles, the pe-
ripheral cases are coded in two basic ways in Supyire: as indirect objects
marked with adpositions, or as direct objects of serial verbs. The latter cod-
ing method will be dealt with in chapter 8. This section will be concerned
only with the various types of indirect objects which can appear in a simple,
one-verb clause.",[297]
"  Note that two transitive verbs in a serial construction may have different
objects, in which case both may be mentioned. This is rare except with the
instrument marking verb taha, which always takes a different object from the
following verb. An example is: (7) Kä shon-podrji         wä     s) ... toogi     täha
     and horse-male.DEF IND NARR leg.DEF use
     'Then one of the stallions ... used (his) foot
      ä   zäntürjd sä a    cyän.
      SC hyena     kick SC drop
      and kicked Hyena down.'",[309]
"
Chapter 5: Other word classes
1.   A comparison with the Cebaara cognates shows that a distinction has
     been lost in Supyire. In the plural, Cebaara maintains a difference be-
     tween simple and emphatic first and second person pronouns:      Person    Number      Simple    Emphatic        1       singular     m)i       mti
        2       singular     ηιό       ωό
        1       plural       wö        wölo
        2       plural       χέ        ydle      What seems to have happened in Supyire is that the emphatic forms
      have merged with the simple forms. The medial [I] was elided, presum-
      ably at an earlier date than the general elision of medial [1] which is so
      prevalent in the current language. The forms used with clitics mimic the
      earlier simple forms. Of course this does not explain m)i, but perhaps
      when data from other Senufo languages is added, a similar scenario will
      emerge. The simple plural forms also perhaps survive in the non-de-
      clarative pronouns (see next section).
2.    The first person singular form na sometimes has a LMw tune when it is
      the clause initial direct object in an imperative. The explanation for this
      phenomenon is at present unknown.
3.    The corresponding pronouns in Sucite have been labeled 'clitic pro-
      nouns' by Garber (1987: 26).
4.    Garber (1987: 26) labels the cognate set in Sucite as 'emphatic clitics',
      but the tonal behavior of the set in Kampwo Supyire shows that they are
      not clitics in at least that dialect.
5.    This suffix is cognate with the quantifier/adverb πιύ 'also'.
6.    Interrogative pronouns meaning 'who' and 'what' are not integrated
      into the noun gender system. They will be introduced in section 5.9 be-
      low.
7.    When the diminutive suffix is added to this root it has a HL tune:
      numbil§r0[numble:re] 'very small'. This root is used only in the singu-
      lar, the plural being suppletive (see list). It is related to the noun bild
      'seed, small round object, central part, individuated entity' which is
     much used in compounds, e.g. zdwbild 'heart', iwüünbild 'peanut',
     jonibil6 'testis', canmbiJd 'day'.
710   Notes: Chapter 58.  As might be expected, this root is usually in gender 2, the gender of
    large things. It is related to the verb buugo 'be big', which was probably
    originally the causative of a now defunct verb *gbulu or *gbo/o which
    gave rise to the adjective form. The verb ρέό 'be big* is probably also
    related. The cognate forms in Cebaara are kp616 'be big' and kp0?0 'be
    big, make big'.
9. More precisely: 'light colored'. This is related to the verb ίίηίηέ 'be
    white, whiten', which was probably originally the causative form of a
    subsequently lost verb *finiibe white' which gave rise to the adjective.
10. More precisely: 'warm colored'. This is related to the verb jiääsjä
    'redden, be red', which was probably originally the causative form of a
    now lost verb *jiana 'be red'.
11. This root appears in the quantifier puni 'all' (probably a grammaticali-
    zation of a gender 3 singular definite form) and the adverb puno 'at all'.
12. This root has several different forms. It may have a HL tune like the
    singular -bile, as reflected in the gender 3 plural form numpyigii. It is
    also used in the collective gender 4, where it has the following forms
    num-pye-re (with lowering of the vowel), num-pyi-rd (with HL tune),
    num-pyigi-rd (with an extra syllable of unknown origin), and num-pyii-
    rd (by elision of the /g/ from the preceding form). As if this were not
    enough, the plural of the singular noun bild (see note 7) is pya-a 'seeds,
    small rounded objects (G3P)'. Both forms are undoubtedly related also
    to pyä 'child (G1S)' (plural: pyi-i). The close relation of these different
    forms almost certainly goes back to proto-Niger-Congo. Cf. the sug-
    gested proto-NC roots from Bole-Richard (1988) ba / bi 'child', 'seed',
    pi 'small'.
13. This root appears in the definite 'other' determiner sanqa etc. 'the rest,
    the remainder'. See section 5.1.2.11 above.
14. Cf. the noun tara 'earth, ground (G4)'.
15. Recall that fricatives are voiced and the nasal is elided in nasal-fricative
    clusters. This NP is taken from a sentence in which it is the direct ob-
    ject of the verb 'find': 'Then I found him lying beside the car.'
16. Although the verb is not nasalized in Kampwo Supyire, it is in Sucite
    and in central Senufo languages. The adjective form is thus the older of
    the two.
17. An alternate, palatalized, form tiijicin is used by some speakers.
18. On the basis of the Minyanka form gbara- this can probably be recon-
    structed, at least for proto-Northern-Senufo, as *gbara.
19. 'First' (-cyii-) and 'last' (-sanN-) are adjective roots, and behave like
    other adjectives. See section 5.2 above.
20. The final L of the ordinal only appears on the following -mi-. The latter
    has a basic Mw tune.
                                                          Notes: Chapter 6   711
21. Punf also has an indefinite form, but this is used exclusively in the ad-
    verbial function alluded to below. It is a nominalization of an adjective
    root puN- (see section 5.2 above).
22. See preceding note. Puno is actually mostly used in negative clauses,
    where its meaning is '(not) at all'.
23. This has a very restricted use as an adverb, being used only with verbs
    repeated to code duration. The ye in such cases adds intensity to the ac-
    tion and length to the duration.
24. This adverb expresses counterexpectation and surprise.
25. Borrowed from Bambara.
26. This word is interesting for having the sole instance of a labiovelar stop
    recorded so far in Kampwo Supyire. The sound is common in other
    Senufo languages.
27. The suffix -oo on this adverb is perhaps related to the 'attenuation'
    marker yod (see section 5.10).
28. This is related to the nominalizing suffix -mbää 'without' (see chapter
    3, section 3.2.2.8). Both are borrowed from Bambara: ball 'prevent
    from', and      -bali'without'.
29. There is no simple English equivalent of the French preposition chez 'at
    the house o f .
30. This is the lexicalization pattern labeled 'Romance' by Talmy (1985).
31. This looks like a caique on the Bambara preposition-postposition combi-
    nation ni...ye. Ni\s also a conjunction in Bambara used to conjoin noun
    phrases. Ye is a postposition with other uses as well, notably da-
    tive/benefactive and locative goal. The combination ni...ye, like the
    Supyire equivalent, codes comitative and instrument.
32. The definite suffix is often added to the noun: njpirjf na.
33. The definite suffix is sometimes added to the noun: ß\vog6na.
34. Some speakers leave off the simple postposition. For these speakers,
    käntugo is a new simple postposition.
35. Färäfin is borrowed from Bambara, and means literally 'black skin'.","[732, 733, 734]"

                               Introduction
1.1. The peopleThe Supyire language is spoken by the Supyire people. The noun süpyfrä, in
effect, has two meanings: 'the people' and 'the language spoken by the peo-
ple'. The word is used as a name in both senses in this grammar. The
Supyire live in southeastern Mali in the region of Sikasso (see map 1). By
tradition they came from the south, and this is probably historically accurate
since the main body of the Senufo language group, to which Supyire
belongs, is located in northern Cöte d'lvoire (see map 2).
  The Supyire are peasant farmers. They cultivate various kinds of cereals
and keep livestock. Traditional political organization did not go beyond the
village level. They have, however, been incorporated into various political
entities in the region. In the last 125 years they have successively been part
of the Jula kingdom of Sikasso, French West Africa, and finally the country
of Mali.
  The dialect described in this grammar is spoken in the region of Kampwo,
to the west of Sikasso and bordering the Bambara-speaking region of Gana
(not to be confused with the country of Ghana). The data was collected in
the village of Farakala, located 40 kilometers west of Sikasso on the main
road to the capital Bamako, and from neighboring villages, none more than
15 kilometers from Farakala.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"To avoid possible ambiguity with a dative meaning, the complex postposi-
tion mee na 'for the sake o f , literally 'on voice/name o f is used. Compare
the following examples: (105)      A. U      a     y)       jwd mil τηέέ na.    BENEFACTIVE

  Withβάάτέ 'pray, beg', the person prayed for (or about) is marked with the
postposition na: (106)   Kile ßäärä mil nä.
         God pray me on
         'Pray to God for me.*  The benefactive case role may also be encoded by means of the verb kan
'give' in a serial verb construction. See chapter 8, section 8.3.4.2, for a de-
scription of this construction.","[297, 298]"
"  Like all determiners, the definite 'other' determiners take a definite head
noun. Because their noun gender marking is that used on nouns, they them-
selves may take either definite or indefinite suffixes. In all the above exam-
ples, the definite form is used, and this is by far the most common usage. In
200   Chapter 6: Norn phrasesfact, although speakers will readily supply the indefinite forms if asked for
them, only two naturally occurring cases have been recorded, compared to
more than fifty of the definite forms. It is curious that both these cases are in
gender 4, but no explanation for this has been found. The meaning appears
to be the same as when the definite form is used.","[222, 223]"
"
5.1. Pronouns and determiners
Supyire pronouns may be divided into two quite distinct groups on the basis
of morphological form: first and second person pronouns, and third person
pronouns. Third person pronouns are intimately tied to the noun gender sys-
tem. There are separate pronouns for each gender, singular and plural. The
anaphoric pronouns are phonologically clitics, and undergo many tonal rules
which to not apply to nouns. First and second person declarative pronouns,
on the other hand, behave tonally like nouns, and from the point of view of
the gender system, they resemble gender 1 nouns. None of the Supyire pro-
nouns is sensitive to case (with the exception that the first person singular
non-declarative pronoun cannot be subject). The same form is used for sub-
ject, direct object, indirect object, and possessor.",[174]
"     Literally, 'the remainder of four o'clock is ten minutes'.
712   Notes: Chapter 62.  This could conceivably mean 'the house of this/that one (gender 2)',
    with a gender 2 antecedent such as pükwdrdgd 'woman from another
    village (gender 2)'. In this case tones do not disambiguate since ba-
    'house' has a strong mid tune.
3. This example is taken from an account of the aftermath of the French
    conquest of Sikasso. Kuluncungo, one of the sons of Babemba (the last
    king of Sikasso, killed during the French invasion), was counseled by
    some of his brothers to go join the forces of Samory, then fighting
    against the French in the south. He declined, recalling that Samory had
    beseiged Sikasso for sixteen months several years earlier. He is reported
    to have then uttered the example in the text, to the effect that he would
    rather go die at the hands of the French in Sikasso than join the old en-
    emy of his family, Samory.
4. Kalify6 is borrowed from French qualifier.
5. That is, as if they are the head noun of a genitive construction. This is a
    not uncommon pattern cross-linguistically. Croft (1991: 134) points out
    that often over time a noun + numeral combination based on a genitive
    construction changes into a construction more like noun + adjective. It
    is thus interesting to note that for many speakers of Supyire, the nu-
    meral behaves tonally like a possessed (head) noun only when the noun
    is follows is indefinite. For these speakers, when the head is definite,
    the number (also in definite form) keeps its basic tones. It is not known
    how widespread this practice is.
6. Three cases of the use of ηιύ with a number having a definite suffix
    have been recorded, all from the same speaker.
7. For this speaker (from the Jamutani quartier of Farakala), the imperfec-
    tive suffix -//undergoes vowel harmony.
8. This and the following example show the lack of application of ex-
    pected tone rules referred to in note 5 above. For this speaker, the
    definite numbers are unaffected tonally, while the indefinite numbers
    behave as if possessed.
9. The elicitation of the following example actually was the occasion of a
    sharp dispute. One onlooker objected strongly that no such combination
    should be tolerated. The person who produced the example maintained
    equally heatedly that it was perfectly acceptable. As noted in the text,
    no examples of this sort have turned up in recorded discourse material.
10. This example is from a text on funeral customs. The corpse is wrapped
    in cloths taken from among the cloths brought by relatives for the fu-
    neral, and the number used in the wrapping is quite definite: three for a
    man, four for a woman. There is thus no indeterminacy in the disjunc-
    tion, as there is in the English translation. Note that the conjunction
     wälä 'or' is borrowed from Bambara.
11. Of course the specification of any number indicates that the speaker at-
    taches a high degree of importance to that participant. The use of the

    higher numbers, however, is more obviously related to the numerical
    meaning, whereas the singularity of 'one' makes it redundant when the
    language already distinguishes singularity morphologically.
12. 'Time' in the sense of'occasion', as in 'He fell three times. 1
13. The /f/ of shon- is voiced due to the final nasal of the preceding root.
14. In the text corpus, mujyd is used only 6 times, whereas punf is used 204
    times.
15. Jugü 'evil' is borrowed from Bambara jugu 'evil'.
16. Cf. English selfsame.
17. Kälä 'read' (the low tone comes from the direct object) is borrowed
    from Bambara kalan 'read'.
18. A/o£///'car' is borrowed from Bambara        mobili'car'.
19. Compare English 'That isn't done.'
20. Κόηιϊ' as if is borrowed from French comme.
21. Tire 'train' and bombärär6 are borrowed from French train and bom-
     barder.
22. The antecedent of the possessive pronoun wu- is mobilige 'truck'. This
    is an example of the extended use of a genitive phrase with a pronoun
    head described in the preceding section.
23. Tea is 'raised' in Supyire: the verb reduplicated here consists of the
    root yiri 'rise, go up' together with the causative suffix -gV.
24. The sootänhätjke and soobtfni are the two pedals attached to the heddles
    of a loom.","[734, 735, 736]"
"Unlike the nouns, however, the mid remains in a genitive construction when
the possessed word begins with a strong mid:

 (4) m)i    bag0
      my house .DEF
      'my house""   The second person singular pronoun mu has a simple strong mid tone tune.
It does not perturb in any known environment.
   The vowels of m)i, wilu, and yti are somewhat unusual. They are notice-
ably longer than ordinary single vowels, but usually not as long as ordinary
long vowels. This may be due to the fact that they are not stressed. However,
it should be pointed out that every other instance of word final long vowels
can be demonstrated to have developed through the elision of a medial con-
sonant. This consonant (usually /l/ or /n/) resurfaces when a vowel-initial
clitic follows the long vowel. In the case of these pronouns, no such conso-
nant surfaces. Instead, the vowels of the pronoun are merely replaced with
the corresponding approximant ([w] for /u/ and [y] for /i/), and an additional
mora is assigned to the clitic vowel, just as if the pronoun vowel were short. 1
   For purposes of agreement, first and second person pronouns are in gender
1, which is semantically the gender of human beings. Thus, for example,
when a pronoun in subject position is fronted for focus, the resumptive pro-
noun which holds its subject position is υ (gender 1 singular) for the singular
and pi (gender 1 plural) for the plural: (5) a. Mii u     a        Ji pyi.
        I     s/hePERF it do
        'It's I who did it.'
      b. Yii       pi   a       ύ    kän ya   ä.
         you(PL) they PERF him give them(G2P) to
         'It's you who gave him to them.'","[175, 176]"
"
3.1. Noun gendersSupyire has a typical Niger-Congo noun class system, with eight noun
classes grouped into five genders. Although there is no verb agreement,
there is full concord within the noun phrase: determiners, independent
adjectives, and at least some quantifiers agree in noun class with the head
noun. Pronouns of course agree in noun class with their antecedents.
  The gender system is quite well-behaved. The phenomenon of a particular
morphological form participating in more than one gender, so widespread in
Bantu (e.g. class 10 may be the plural of both class 9 and class 11), is absent
in Senufo. 1 There is therefore little motivation to number the noun classes 1-
8 in imitation of descriptions of Bantu. In this grammar the genders are num-
bered 1-5. Individual classes will be labeled 'gender 1 singular', 'gender 3
plural', and so forth. 2 Genders 4 and 5 are single class genders.
  The morphological elements which mark noun gender may mark some
other category as well, such as definiteness. In a general way, one can say
that the noun class is marked by a consonant, and that other functions are
marked by the following vowel. It is thus possible to speak of ""class
consonants"": each noun class has a typical consonant or family of
consonants (sharing the same point of articulation) which recur again and
again in the morphological marking of that class. Table 3 shows the class
consonant for each class, and in parentheses the related consonants which
may mark the class.
  One remark is necessary concerning the gender 3 plural. It will be noticed
that none of the consonants in parentheses are alveopalatal. In fact,
originally the class consonant was /k/, and this is the form which some old
people still prefer. This is being replaced by Id in most of Kampwo,
however.
76   Chapter 3: Nouns
3.1.1. The gender suffixesNoun gender is marked on nouns by means of suffixes. There are two sets of
suffixes, which we will label basic and definite.","[98, 99]"
"  When the focused item is the predicate nominal, however, there are com-
plications. There are two types of cleft construction which focus the predi-
cate nominal. One is used when the subject is a noun, a first or second per-
son pronoun, or an emphatic or demonstrative pronoun. The other is used
when the subject is a simple anaphoric pronoun. The former case is the sim-
pler. The focused item is moved to the front of the clause, just as in verbal
clauses. The subject, however, is postposed to a position after the copula.
The focused item is followed by a resumptive pronoun, just as if it were a
476   Chapter 12: Focus and topic constructionsfocused subject. It thus looks as if the subject and predicate nominal have
switched roles. Following are some examples: (21) a. Cyde pi       wi       y)l

5.1.2.12. The independent possessive pronouns
A special set of pronominal forms is used as the head of genitive construc-
tions. The independent possessives are not typical pronouns in that they can-
not be used as determiners. Moreover, in form they are like the definite
'other' determiners, viz. root-plus-gender suffix, rather than like ordinary
pronouns.
  The root used to construct the possessed pronouns is wu-y with MwL tone.
It is obviously cognate with the contrastive genitive particle u/wu (see chap-
ter 12, section 12.1.3). It combines with the noun class suffixes as shown in
Table 21.
  The gender 5 forms have the variants wubo and wube. In addition, there
are diminutive forms (in gender 3) wur6 and würüni.
  Like other pronouns, the possessed pronoun agrees in noun class with its
antecedent. It can be loosely translated as 'one' or 'ones', and when the pos-
sessor is pronominal, the entire construction is the equivalent of a possessive
pronoun (mine, ours; etc.) in English. One example must suffice here. The
reader is referred to chapter 6, section 6.2.3 for more examples.

        'mine' (referring to something in gender 3)  The possessive pronoun has developed a couple of other functions besides
filling the role of head of a genitive construction. It is used in the formation
of ordinal numbers (see section 5.3.2 below), and in one type of modifying
phrase within a noun phrase (see chapter 6, section 6.4.2).","[186, 187]"
"
1.2. The language
Supyire belongs to the Senufo group of the Gur family of Niger-Congo. Al-
though no systematic reconstruction has yet been done, preliminary evidence
indicates that the Senufo languages can be divided into northern, central, and
southern branches. Supyire is the southernmost member of the northern
group, which also includes Minyanka (spoken in Mali to the north of Supyi-
re), Nanerge, and Sucite (spoken in Burkina Faso). All of these languages
are quite closely related to each other. Supyire is separated from the central
Senufo languages to the south by a narrow band of Mande-speaking people.
  The Kampwo dialect described in this grammar is only one of several. At
this point little is known of the degree to which the dialects diverge from
each other. Within the Kampwo area the speech is fairly homogenous, and I
had no difficulty in communicating with people 30 kilometers to the south or
2   Chapter 1: Introduction
20 kilometers to the north of Farakala. Further afield, however, there are no-
table differences which call for investigation.
  The Senufo languages are like other Gur languages in having a suffixal
noun class system. They are atypical, however, in having a word order like
that of Mande languages, to which they are geographically contiguous. The
chief peculiarity of this word order is the placement of the direct object be-
fore the verb, but of all indirect objects after the verb. This order is an areal
phenomenon, being also shared by Songai to the north, and, to some extent,
by the Kru languages to the south.
  The Senufo languages resemble the Mande languages in numerous other
ways besides word order. Many of these similarities are noted in this gram-
mar, and many more would doubtless come to light if the matter were
studied systematically. It is fairly clear that there has been a long history of
bilingualism in Bambara (or its diaspora Jula) among the Supyire. Many
lexical items and quite a few grammatical ones have been borrowed from
Bambara, and it is probable that several grammatical constructions are
caiques on the corresponding Bambara constructions. An effort has been
made to indicate Bambara borrowings in the examples. The Bambara forms
given are taken from Bailleul (1981), though it should be borne in mind that
the dialect recorded there is standard Bambara, whereas the source dialects
for Supyire loans are normally Gana and Sikasso Jula.","[24, 25]"
"  Finally, it should be noted that just because the relativized noun phrase is
not fronted does not mean that some other constituent cannot be fronted for
focus. The relative clause in this case takes the form of a cleft focus con-
struction. It is impossible to so translate it in English, however, since relative
clauses of this sort are not allowed. In the following example, the relativized
noun phrase has the role of direct object and is not fronted, but the locative
phrase is focused. The coreferential noun phrase is the subject of the main
clause:  (20) Numpmi          i wüu ä pyi  ä

40   Chapter 2: Phonology2.2.2.6. Variation of /i/ and /e/ in cliticsThe two postpositions / 'in' and / 'with' 2 9 both have alternate forms e. If the
preceding vowel is stressed, the e forms are selected only if that stressed
vowel is e. This is the case with most demonstratives (examples in this sec-
tion will all be given using the postposition 'with'; in each case 'in' would
have the same vowel but a different tone):  (75)       6       'with that (G2S)'
         ήάέ ό       'with that (G3S)'Following all other stressed vowels, / is used:  (76) pyä       )      'with a child'
       fyi       )      'with a python'
       tu        )      'with father'
       pwun      )      'with a dog'     [ρφνί]
       nd        i      'with a husband'The sole exception to this rule discovered so far is ivwd 'snake', which in
the speech of some people takes e rather than /.
  If the preceding vowel is unstressed, the e form is selected only if the con-
sonant preceding the unstressed vowel is not a nasal:  (77)   le      e      'with it'      <      Ii       'it (G3S)'
         tile    6      'with fathers' <      Hi       'fathers' 3 0

         tüügd έ        'with a hoe' <        tHügd    'hoe'
         tüüyd 6        'with hoes'    <      tüüyd     'hoes'If the unstressed vowel is preceded by a nasal consonant, / is always
selected:  (78)   bwünn) ί          'with a granary'      <     bwüün           'granary'
         düfaäntji)        'with a donkey'       <     düfaänqä        'donkey'
         biinnii    i      'with light'          <     biinnii         'light'  The definite gender 2 plural suffix -yi is an exception                           to   this
generalization. Instead of the expected e form, it takes r.  (79)   tüüyf             'with the hoes'             tüüyf           'the hoes'
                                                                              2.2. Vowels   412.2.2.7. Rounding before labialsThe unstressed [i] of the adjective prefix niN- becomes [u] for most speakers

               ADJ             stick.in              G2S             'stuck in'  Roots beginning with /ww/ (/w/ plus secondary release before a back
vowel) also trigger this change, but not those beginning with simple /w/.
Compare: (81)          niN-    +       wwo             +     -gV             nurjgwoho

2.2.2.8. Spread of nasalizationNasalization spreads to adjacent vowels when no consonant intervenes: (82) pwun )          [ρφυ!]          'with a dog'It also spreads across [?] and [1], but not across other consonants: (83)   kin•      +        -gV              känhä          [kä?ä]
        village            G2S              'village'

        sit                G3S              'residency'In all these cases, nasalization is written (with an ή) only on the first syllable
where it occurs.
42   Chapter 2: Phonology2.3. Tone
Tone has a high functional load in Supyire. Boys cowherding in the bush
often communicate with each other by whistling. The whistling contains no
other information than vowel length and pitch, but this is sufficient to permit
fairly detailed conversations. In learning to speak Supyire I often had the ex-
perience of an interlocutor interpreting my speech on the basis of my
(incorrect) tones, assuming that I had mistaken the consonants and vowels,
which were in fact much closer to what they were supposed to be than the
tones.
  There are four phonemic tones. The high (H) and low (L) are fairly ordi-
nary, but the middle two are differentiated in behavior rather than pitch. One
of these, which we will call strong mid (Ms) undergoes substantially less
perturbation than the other, which we will call weak mid (Mw). As will be-
come apparent, weak mid resembles high in its behavior. Northern Senufo
languages (Supyire, Sucite, Mamara) all have both weak and strong mid
tones. Central Senufo languages such as Cebaara and Shenara, however,
seem to have a more conventional three tone-system. Cebaara cognates for
Supyire weak mid verbs are mostly high tone. Garber (1987: 227) suggests
that proto-Senufo had a four-tone, four-pitch system, and that the upper of
the two middle tones was subsequently lost in some languages by merger
with high.32 In northern Senufo the upper of the two middle tones has
merged phonetically (that is, it is realized on the same phonetic pitch) with
the other mid tone. This phonetic neutralization has not entailed serious
phonological neutralization, however, due to the complex tone rules of
Supyire. In effect, the two mid tones behave quite differently with respect to
tone rules, and consequently, in the majority of environments one or the
other is possible, but not both. Consider the following example. When a
weak mid noun occurs as the possessed noun in a genitive construction in
which the possessor is the first person singular pronoun mH\ it is raised to
high tone: cig6 'the tree' becomes m)i cige 'my tree' (the -ge is the definite
noun suffix for gender 2 singular). When a strong mid noun occurs in the
same environment, however, it keeps its mid tone: bag6'the house' stays m)i
bag6. The multiplicity of rules of this sort ensure that words with weak mid
tone are nearly always distinguished from those with strong mid tone.
  As in many tone languages, different subsystems of the language exhibit
somewhat different tonal behavior. In particular, verbs, nouns, pronouns, and
adverbs all differ in tonal behavior. Verbs and pronouns are rather more sus-
ceptible to perturbation than nouns, which in turn are more perturbable than
adverbs.
  Syllabic nasals and of course vowels may bear significant tone. In
addition, initial nasals which precede stops may also carry significant tone
(with important restrictions—see below), but word-medial nasals which
precede stops always take the tone of the previous vowel. A stressed vowel
                                                               2.3. Tone   43may carry up to three tones, but this is rare. Rather more common are
vowels with two tones, but by far the most common are vowels with one
tone. Pre-stop nasals and unstressed vowels may only carry one tone.
Spreading rules must sometimes make reference to moras.
  Tone rules are also sensitive to different kinds of boundary. Most tone
rules apply only in relatively close syntactic environments, such as between
possessor and possessed in genitive constructions, between direct object and
verb, between noun phrase and postposition. In other contexts, even within
the same clause, a rule may not apply. Certain morphological boundaries are
impermeable to tone spreading, but allow feature changing rules to apply
across them.
  The following discussion will begin with an examination of basic tone
tunes and then proceed to an exposition of the various rules needed to
account for the Supyire data.","[62, 63, 64, 65, 66]"
"  The second function is to mark the standard of comparison case. The noun
phrase introduced in this way is an indirect object marked by the postposi-
tion na. Following is an example: (31)    Pyäqi            num-bilS.na                        ä           pyi       ä       kyaa      cd

         'The younger child knew

         SC pass ADJ-be.old.DEF on
         more than the older.'",[321]
"  Identificational clauses have no further constituents (see following section
for a description). As can be seen from the examples above, however, copu-
lar and verbal clauses can and usually do consist of more than simply a sub-
ject followed by a copula or verb. Except in the case of existential clauses,
copular clauses have something following the copula, either a predicate
nominal, as in the above example, or an adpositional phrase functioning as a
locative or dative, or an adverb:  (2) a. with locative phrase
           U pye bag£            e.
           she be house .DEF in
           'She's in the house.'
        b. with dative phrase
           Ku pye m)i ά.
           it    be me to
           'It's mine (lit. it is to me).'
        c. with adverb
           U pye ani.
           she be there
           'She's there.'",[261]
"  When the relativized noun phrase is a first or second person pronoun, the
coreferential noun phrase is the same pronoun, as in (16) above. When the
relativized noun phrase is non-referential, the second person singular pro-
noun is sometimes used as a coreferent, in a manner reminiscent of the non-
referential use of 'you' in English. (The following example is also of interest
in that it has a topic noun phrase preceding the relative clause.) (26) Fäägä     ta-cyinge         cögdrji

in Supyire, as is common in languages with gender systems. Thus while gen-
der 1 can be characterized semantically as the ""human"" gender, there are a
few words in other genders which can be used to refer to human beings. The
gender 2 noun yaaga 'thing', for example, is sometimes used in a rather in-
formal way to refer to a person. In syntactically ""tight"" constructions, such
as within a noun phrase, agreement is governed entirely by grammatical
gender. In ""loose"" constructions, however, such as between clauses, there is
a tendancy to revert to a more semantically appropriate gender. Note in the
following example that the relative determiner agrees with its gender 2 head
noun, but the coreferential noun phrase in the main clause is gender 1, which
is more semantically appropriate: (27) Ml) könä ä        y)ri     bildre   e mä pä

          slavery and came here was K a f y a a /  Relative clauses in which the relativized noun phrase functions to encode
time frequently function as time adverbial clauses for the following main
clause, and in this case there is usually no coreferential noun phrase in the
main clause. (18) above is an example of this. Often the noun cyaga 'place'
is used instead of a time word:  (28)    U a      ylrd             jwü cyäge       j}k6-mii ) g6y

                              13.4. Non-referential relativized noun phrases   505Time adverbial clauses with past time reference are historically derived from
such relative clauses by the omission of the relativized noun phrase as well.
See chapter 15, section 15.1.1.1 for a description.
  A final note on the coding of the coreferential noun phrase: although they
are not generally placed in focus position, there is certainly no prohibition
against this. Examples (12a), (16b), (19a) and (19b) above illustrate this. The
same discourse-pragmatic motivations which lead to focusing of ordinary
noun phrases are responsible for the focusing of the coreferential noun
phrase.","[526, 527, 528]"
"
9.4.1. The marking of negationIn most ΤΑΜ categories negation is doubly marked in the clause. A clause
final negative particle is obligatory. It is in most tense-aspects supplemented
by a marking in the auxiliary position, i.e. immediately following the sub-
ject. This kind of double marking is widespread in central and northern
Senufo languages. In most cases it is not clear what the etymology of the
negative markers is, so it is difficult at this point to say whether the double
marking arose from a reinforcing strategy (with the clause final marking
being added to reinforce the earlier auxiliary strategy) or from some other
source. Whatever the etymological source of the clause final markers, they
are not derived from direct objects in the manner of French pas or English
not, since they come in the wrong position in the clause for that. The most
likely source would be some sort of adverb.",[399]
"
14.2.2.1. Basic structure of constituent questions  Constituent questions are doubly marked in Supyire. They contain question
words, which have no non-interrogative function (unlike the corresponding
words in languages like English or French, in which many of the question
words also function as relative pronouns), and they are marked with sentence
final interrogative particles. Three such markers are used. Most of the ques-
tion words are accompanied by the particle ye. Some speakers also occa-
sionally use bi for these question types.10 Locative questions take the final
marker k6 (usually voiced to g€).
  There are five simple question words in Kampwo Supyire, in addition to
the interrogative determiners, for which there are both ordinary and em-
phatic forms for each of the genders. Table 41 lists these question words.
Only the gender 1 singular interrogative determiners are included; for the
forms of the determiners in other genders see Tables 18 and 19 in chapter S.
'When' and 'why' are missing from the table because they are not simple
question words (see section 14.2.2.3 for 'why' and 14.2.2.6 for 'when').",[556]
"The basic structure of copular clauses can thus be summarized as follows:  (3)    SUBJECT         COPULA              PREDICATE NOMINAL
                                             LOCATIVE OR DATIVE PHRASE
                                             ADVERB  Verbal clauses have many more possible constituents. Except in very lim-
ited cases, verbal clauses require one or more tense-aspect-modality (ΤΑΜ)
auxiliaries, which immediately follow the subject, and are frequently pho-
nologically cliticized to it. Like copular clauses, verbal clauses may also
have adpositional phrases (functioning as indirect objects with various se-

          she FUT FP-come now
          'She will come now/In addition, transitive verbs may take a direct object, which is placed be-
tween the auxiliary and the verb: (5) with direct object
      U       nmha suro        shwoho.
      she HAB mush cook
      'She cooks mush.'","[261, 262]"
"The post-head demonstrative may preserve a proximal/distal distinction
which has been lost elsewhere. This will be discussed below in connection
with the simple determiners. See chapter 13 for a description of relative
clauses.
  The anaphoric and emphatic pronouns (for the forms, see chapter 5, sec-
tions 5.1.2.1 and 5.1.2.2) are used only for coreference, and have no deictic
function. Anaphoric pronouns, which are phonologically clitics, may not be
placed in focus or topic position nor may they appear in predicate nominal
position. In all these places emphatics must be used instead.
  Following are some examples of both anaphoric and emphatic pronouns
used as determiners:

          'this/that meat'  As shown in these examples, the head noun in such a noun phrase normally
takes the definite suffix. There is one frozen expression where this is not the
case. The simple gender 2 singular determiner ku is used with the indefinite
canija 'day' in time expressions meaning 'that day': (7) Ku         canqa       nümpanqa na,
      that.G2S day.G2S tomorrow on
      'The next day (lit. on that day's tomorrow),

      the guests who have come to bury the dead person disperse (to their
      respective villages).'","[214, 215]"
"  Case recoverability for indirect objects is simple: the adpositional marking
is placed with the focused noun phrase at the head of the clause. There is no
resumptive pronoun to mark the position from which the focused item has
been removed. Following are some examples: (7) Mii ά      mu könä i        wyeire4     ta,
     me from you TOP PERF poison.DEF get
     'It was from me that you bought the poison,
      ήkää wyeire        Jakyärä5 ßye mi) ä me.
      but poison.DEF antidote be me to NEG
      but I don't have an antidote for it.'",[494]
"
6.2.1. Simple   genitivesThe genitive construction in Supyire is marked solely by tonal changes. The
genitive (possessor) noun phrase precedes the head (possessed) noun, and
most of the tone changes which are possible in the language affect the head.
Briefly, the changes are: 1) a mid tone genitive raises a low tone head to
mid; 2) a low tone spreads from a genitive onto a following weak mid head;
3) a mid tone genitive raises a following weak mid head to high tone. See
chapter 2 sections 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 for details of how these rules work.
  There is a marked genitive construction which has a genitive particle u be-
tween the possessor and the possessed nouns. It functions to encode contras-
tive focus on the possessor nominal. This construction is described in section
12.1.3 of chapter 12.
  Semantically, the genitive construction covers a much wider range of rela-
tionships than legal ownership of property. Supyire makes no syntactic dis-
tinction between inalienable ""possession"" such as part-whole and kinship re-
lations and alienable possession.
  There are no special possessive pronouns in Supyire. Any pronoun except
the reflexives, independent possessives, and identifiers may function as a
genitive. The pronoun agrees with its antecedent and not with the head
(possessed) noun. Determiners may be distinguished from genitives on this
basis:  (23) a. determiner, agrees with head
           $k6           ba-g6
           DEM(G2S) house-DEF(G2S)
           'this/that house' 2
                                               6.2. Genitive constructions   201
       b. genitive, agrees with antecedent
           ήβέ           ba-g6
           DEM(GIS) house-DEF(G2S)
           'this/that one's house'  If the antecedent happens to be of the same number and gender as the head
(possessed) noun, then the genitive will appear to agree. Here is where tonal
changes are of service. Determiners cause no tone perturbations at all, but in
a genitive construction the floating low tone which follows every definite
pronoun spreads onto the following head noun if it can. If this spread of low
tone takes place, therefore, one immediately knows that one is in the pres-
ence of a genitive construction rather than a determiner plus head noun.
Following are some examples: (24) a. determiner, no tone changes in head

           DEM(GIS) woman-DEF(GlS)
           'this/that one's wife'
           uru                 pwün-ηί
           his/her(EMPH.G 1 S)dog-DEF(G IS)
           'his/her dog'  The simple determiner/pronoun u, which behaves phono logically as a cli-
tic, does not provide as much help here. If the noun's tune is mid-low, as in
cedyi and pwunrji, the mid-low tune of the pronoun merges with it to pro-
duce a mid-low tune over all. Thus u pwugi could mean either 'his/her dog'
or 'this/that dog'. Only when the head noun has a basic weak mid tune does
the floating low of the simple pronoun/determiner provide any distinction,
the low of the pronoun turning up on the noun. Thus 'this/that vervet mon-
key', with the noun tune intact, is u koorji\ but 'his/her vervet monkey' is u
kodgi.
  First and second person pronouns, when they precede nouns, may only be
interpreted as genitives. They cause the same tonal perturbations as nouns
with similar tunes. In the following examples the underlying tones are given
above, the surface tones being marked on the vowels:

          'our mother'  The first and second person non-declarative pronouns may be used in geni-
tive constructions in declarative clauses when they are reflexive, i.e. when
they are coreferential with the subject of the clause: (26) Kä mi) /        nä             yääyi lwb           a   kard...
      and I    NARR my.NONDECL thing.DEF take            SC go
      'Then I took my things and went...'","[223, 224, 225]"
"
13.3. The coreferential noun phrase in the main clause
As noted in section 13.1 above, the most common way of marking the coref-
erential noun phrase in the main clause is by means of an emphatic pronoun.
This goes well with the other functions of the emphatic pronouns in complex
sentences. They are generally used to show coreference in relatively ""loose""
constructions where a high degree of referential ""interference"" is common.
Thus the emphatics are used in a ""logophoric"" function in the loosely bound
indicative complements of verbs of speech and cognition (i.e. they show
coreference with the subject of the main clause; see chapter 11, section
11.5.1). They serve as the coreferential noun phrase in left dislocated topic
constructions, where the topic is typically separated from the main clause
with a pause (see chapter 12, section 12.2.2). In the latter construction, how-
ever, other ways of coding the coreferential noun phrase are allowed, and
this is the case with the coreferential noun phrase in the main clause of rela-
tive clause constructions. In this section we will briefly examine some of
these alternate codings.
  When the relativized noun phrase (and consequently the coreferential noun
phrase) is non-referential and [ +human], the emphatic is sometimes used as
a determiner with the noun foo 'owner, agent, person'. Following is an ex-
ample ( = example 13): (21)   ljg6-mü      u si          ß-ja              mil lw6         fi-cyän        ke,

        'The one who will be able to throw me,
        ml) si     ηύ/ji           kan      uru             fdlä     ά.
        I    FUT cow.DEF give that(EMPH) person to
        I will give the cow to that person.'",[524]
"
5.11. Inteijections
Like any language, Supyire has a large, heterogenous class of interjections.
Only a few will be mentioned here. Agreement is shown with odn or aän or
mm 'yes', disagreement with 6nho or mhm ' n o ' . The agreement interjections
are regularly used by a listening interlocutor to indicate that the discourse is
being monitored. This role is extremely important even when the discourse is
a monologue, such as a folk tale, and is known as οοηηίshwo 'to answer the
yes*.
  Surprise or disbelief is indicated by a variety of interjections: 6, 6), haan,
0he, päpapä. More elaborate exclamations are greatly favored by some:
bismilahi 'in the name of God' (from Arabic), pätfsägkänä '(exclamation of
surprise or embarrassment)' (from Bambara).
  An extremely common interjection is pyi, which can mean a variety of dif-
ferent things, including 'well', 'all right', 'and so'. It is exactly equivalent in
function to Bambara ayiwa.

                               Noun phrases
In Supyire noun phrases some modifying elements precede and some follow
the head noun. In very general terms (there are exceptions), those elements
which precede the head indicate a definite reference, while those elements
which follow the head are either descriptive or else indicate indefinite refer-
ence. Thus definite determiners precede the head, while indefinite and inter-
rogative determiners follow the head. Genitive (possessor) noun phrases pre-
cede the head (possessed) noun phrase, while quantifiers and adjectives fol-
low the head.
  The head of a noun phrase may be either a noun or a pronoun. As will be
shown in the ensuing discussion, the latter can admit a variety of modifying
elements.","[209, 210, 211, 212]"
"  The other strategy of agreement with coordinate noun phrases has been re-
corded in only two syntactic environments so far: focus of the subject noun
phrase, and modification by an independent adjective. Both may be charac-
terized as being ""tight"" constructions, and the agreement is not anaphoric in
nature. In both cases the agreeing item agrees only with the final conjunct.
  Contrastive focus is accomplished in Supyire by moving the focused item
to the front of its clause (for a full description see chapter 12). When a sub-
ject, which is already at the head of its clause, is focused, it is immediately
followed by a resumptive pronoun which holds its place and is the sole indi-
cation that focus is intended. No pause may intervene between the focused
noun phrase and the place-holding pronoun. The pronoun agrees only with
the last conjunct of a coordinate noun phrase in both number and gender. In
the following example, both conjuncts are gender 1. The place-holding pro-
noun agrees in number only with the final conjunct. Note that the predicate
nominal agrees in both gender and number:

1.7. A word on the examplesThe majority of examples used are taken from the text collection alluded to
in section 1.5 above. Occasionally elicited examples are used in the interests
of clarity. Glossing presents a few problems. The sex-based gender system
of English pronouns is a constant annoyance. The gender 1 pronouns of
Supyire are used for human beings of both sexes. In elicited examples the
gloss 's/he' is used for the gender 1 singular pronouns to indicate that a
person of either sex could be intended. In examples taken from texts, the
gloss used is simply 'he* or 'she' depending on the sex of the participant
referred to. It should always be born in mind, however, that the gloss adds
information which is not actually present in the Supyire.
  On the other hand, the glosses employed on occasion leave out
information, in the interests of avoiding irrelevant clutter. Thus in much of
the grammar, pronouns of various genders are glossed as 'it', without
6   Chapter I: Introduction
indicating the particular gender involved. In a similar way, definite noun
suffixes are simply labeled 'DEF', without indicating their gender. Anyone
interested in the precise gender of a pronoun or suffix will find the tables in
chapters 3 and 5 handy.
   Another case of underdifferentiation in glossing is the narrative conjunc-
tions kä and mä. These are usually glossed simply 'and', although they usu-
ally mean something like 'and then' and also include switch reference infor-
mation: kä indicates different subject, mä same subject as the preceding
clause.
   The differences in word order between English and Supyire have made the
free translations of multi-line examples awkward at times. This problem is
especially acute with relative clauses, which in Supyire are preposed to the
main clause rather than embedded. In chapter 13 accordingly many examples
have a more natural translation appended at the end labeled 'Freely... 1 . This
translation is closer to the functional equivalent in English, though of course
it is further from the Supyire form.

                                  Phonology
Supyire phonology is complex and interesting enough to merit a full-scale
study on its own. This chapter is intended to give the essentials only, in
order to make the remainder of the grammar intelligible. Some general
remarks about the phonology as a whole will be followed by sections on
consonants, vowels, and tones.
  The orthography used in the examples throughout this grammar is phone-
mic and follows the guidelines and rules laid down by the Direction Nation-
ale d Ά Iphab6tisation Fonctionelle et de Linguistique Appliqu6e, a sub-
ministry of the Ministry of Education of the Government of Mali. Most
letters have approximately the values which they have in the International
Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), including the ""special characters"" β (alveopalatal
nasal stop), η (velar nasal stop), ε (low-mid front unrounded vowel), and ο
(low-mid back rounded vowel). Exceptions to the IPA values are: use of y
for the palatal approximant [j] (rather than a high front rounded vowel); use
of j for the voiced alveopalatal affricate [d3] (rather than a palatal
approximant); use of c for the voiceless alveopalatal affricate [tf]; use of the
digraphs sh and zh for the alveopalatal sibilant fricatives [J] and [3]; use of h
for glottal stop [?]; use of a double vowel to indicate vowel length, e.g. aa
for [a:]; and use of n following a vowel to indicate nasalization, e.g. an for
[a].1 Tones are marked using accents over the vowels: ά is high tone and ä is
low tone. Mid tone is unmarked. Various tone combinations on a single
vowel are marked as follows: ä mid-low; ä high-low; ^mid-high; £ low-high.
The apostrophe (') is used to indicate tonal downstep (see section 2.3.5.1). In
this chapter the phonetic realization of a word is frequently given in phonetic
brackets.
  Metrical structure plays a role in every area of the phonology and
morphology. In general there is one stressed syllable per lexical root.
Affixes, clitics, and most other grammatical morphemes (e.g. pronouns,
tense-aspect auxiliaries) do not have stress, although they may combine with
each other to form phonological words complete with stress. In the majority
of lexical roots (including all verbs) the initial syllable is stressed, but there
are a number of roots with an unstressed initial syllable. Roots usually keep
their stress in compounds, so that a two-root compound will have two
stressed syllables. Stress is not written in the orthography.
  There are no closed syllables in Supyire. Syllables are basically CV or
CVV. A few grammatical words (e.g. the pronouns υ and uru) begin with a
V syllable. Only one kind of consonant cluster occurs: nasal + stop. Such a
cluster may occur initially as in (la) below, or medially as in (lb):
8     Chapter 2: Phonology
    (1) a. thpi     'hare*
        b. bdtjke 'the baboon'Two remarks are necessary. The initial nasal in (la) is not syllabic, even
though it has its own tone. There are syllabic nasals in Supyire, but they
arise through vowel elision as will be seen in section 2.2.2.4 below. The
much more common clusters under consideration are pronounced like prena-
salized stops. The second remark follows from the first. It might seem that
the initial syllable of (lb) above should be CVN, i.e. closed with the nasal.
However, when asked to pronounce such words very slowly, native speakers
invariably place the [η] with the following syllable rather than with the pre-
ceding one: bo-gke and not          borj-ke?","[28, 29, 30, 31]"
"  If an indirect object is present, it normally follows the predicate nominal,
but occasionally may precede it, as in the following example: (58) Äihpyi            yli cydebff   mäha m-pyi
      if.COUNTERFACT you.PL women.DEF HAB IP-be
      'If you women weren't
       ämunl mi, m)i mpyi na            si    m-pyi     mu ά pyä.
       thus     NEG I      PAST PROG FUT FP-become you to child
       like that, I would have become a child for you.'
262   Chapter 7: Simple clauses
7.4.4. Transitive   verbsIn this section we will examine those verbs which ordinarily take a direct
object. Before proceeding to a closer look at the various configurations of
semantic roles possible with this large group, a word should be said about
the intransitive use of these verbs. For the great majority, the intransitive has
passive meaning, the subject in this case coding the patient of change. This
passive use is described in section 10.2.1 of chapter 10. Besides the passive,
there are two other constructions which detransitivize transitive verbs. These
are the suppression of the patient of certain verbs verbs and the demotion of
the patient to an indirect object role with a few other verbs. Both of these
are relatively minor constructions in terms of the number of verbs they can
occur with. They are dealt with in sections 10.2.2 and 10.2.3 of chapter 10.","[284, 285]"
"
2.2.2. Processes affecting unstressed       vowels2.2.2.1. Vowel harmonyVowel harmony is a pervasive phenomenon in Supyire. Unstressed vowels
within a metrical foot harmonize with the initial stressed vowel if they
belong to the same root or to a harmonizing suffix. Derivational affixes on
verbs and most indefinite noun class suffixes harmonize, while inflectional
affixes on verbs (for the most part) and definite noun suffixes do not
harmonize. The unstressed vowel is normally a copy of the stressed vowel
with the following restrictions: (1) Before pause, the final unstressed vowel
(except in most CVrV verbs) cannot be high. Thus before pause [e] and [o]
follow [i] and [u] respectively. (2) Following a nasal consonant [§]
harmonizes with [e] and [i] (before pause) and [2] harmonizes with [o] and
[u] (before pause). This follows from the fact that all vowels are nasalized
following a nasal consonant and nasalized mid vowels do not exist. (3)
Vowel reduction (see below) often turns the unstressed middle vowel of a
three-syllable foot into [3] or something similar. (4) Before pause a final
unstressed [ε] will often be lowered to [a] and [a] to [a]. Some examples of
harmony in disyllabic feet involving noun class suffixes are: (60) ci-           +      -rV       =>         cire

harmonize. Unstressed initial syllables also do not harmonize. The non-har-
monizing initial vowel may be part of the root (in which case it is always /i/,
/u/, or /a/):  (64) sika        [si'ka]          'goat'
       s)kwύ       [sl'k x u]       'species of ant'

        LOC        eat                 G2S         'place to eat'Initial unstressed syllables are not allowed in verbs.
   A very few exceptions to the process of harmony do occur. The most com-
mon is the verb kare 'go', which would be *kara if it were regular. There are
a few verbs with two pronunciations, one harmonizing and the other not,
such as koro / kore 'chase', para / pare 'span'. From the greater number of
this kind of exception to harmonization in Cebaara (see Mills 1984: 156-157)
it is probable that harmonization is increasing in Supyire, and that the non-
harmonizing variants of the above verbs are the older forms.
   The restriction of homorganicity on VV clusters can be treated as a special
case of harmonization: the second V must harmonize with the first V. This
process can be seen in the assimilation of the narrative auxiliary si when it
follows a pronoun or the conjunction mä. It loses its consonant (which is
first rhotacized and then elided like other intervocalic [r]s), and then the
vowel assimilates totally, e.g. u «/becomes υ ύ, and ma s/becomes maä.

duced. The reduced high vowels sound like very short centralized [u] and [i].
The reduced non-high vowels sound like [a]. Examples for each of the oral

13.2.1. Fronted relativized noun phrasesPlacing the relativized noun phrase at the head of its clause creates the same
case recoverability problem that is encountered in similar constructions such
as clefts and constituent questions: how does the speaker let the hearer know
what syntactic case role the fronted noun phrase has in the following clause?
The problem is solved in precisely the same way in relative clauses as in
clefts (cf. chapter 12, section 12.1.1), and questions (cf. chapter 14, section
14.2.2.1), indicating that all of these constructions share a common focus
strategy. A fronted subject is always followed by a place-holding pronoun
which agrees with it in number and gender, as in the following example (cf.
also 2, 3, and 4 above):  (6) relativized subject, coreferential pronoun

6.3.3.   QuantifiersThe small set of quantifiers (for the forms, see chapter 5, section S.4) follow
the head noun like the cardinal numbers. They evidently originated as heads
of genitive constructions, and accordingly do not agree with their head noun.
They also undergo tone changes as if they were possessed nouns.
  All of the quantifiers are mildly contrastive. They all indicate counterex-
pectation to varying degrees. Speakers would not generally include them
unless they believed that hearers were inclined, for whatever reasons, to be-
lieve wrongly on the point. This is a characteristic which they share with all
restrictive modifiers (see Giv6nT1990, chapter 12).
  It should be noted that some meanings which are coded by quantifiers in
languages like English are expressed by other means in Supyire. Partitive
meanings like 'some' and 'one o f are indicated by using the indefinite de-
terminers, as explained in section 6.1.2.1 above. Meanings like 'many',
214   Chapter 6: Noun phrases'much', Mots o f , 'a few' are usually expressed by means of adjectives de-
rived from verbs, as will be shown in section 6.4 below.","[236, 237]"
"Even where they are allowed (i.e. with the verb kan), recipient direct objects
are quite rare. Of 270 occurrences of kan in the corpus, only 8 ( = 3%) have
recipient direct objects. It is significant that all eight are either anaphoric
pronouns or proper names, an indication that only a highly topical recipient
can be promoted. However, by far the great majority of highly topical re-
cipients (coded by anaphoric pronouns or proper names) are not made direct
object.
  A few verbs take direct objects with the semantic role of locative, instru-
ment, or time. Thus the normally intransitive verb jiaara 'walk' may take
such direct objects as sig6 'the bush', kuni 'the road', or tatoongo 'a long
way' to indicate where or how far the walking occurs. An example of an in-
strumental direct object is the use of Iwoho 'water' as the object of wuli
'bathe' to mean 'take a bath' (lit. 'bathe water'). The verb pyi 'do' may
have the sense 'spend' when it has a direct object referring to a span of time.
Very few verbs have been found so far which permit this kind of non-patient
direct object.
  It is clear therefore that the direct object role is not primarily a pragmatic
one. Its major function is to code the semantic role of patient. It should be

pointed out though that it does not have a corner on patients. As already
noted above, patients can be coded as subject, and as will be shown below,
patients may be ""demoted"" to indirect object.
  The ensuing discussion will demonstrate that the factors affecting
""structural"" transitivity (i.e. whether or not a direct object is present) are of
two sorts. One is pragmatic, involving the relative topicality of participants
in the clause. The other is semantic, involving such things as semantic case
roles (agent, patient, recipient, etc.) and the degree of affectedness of the
patient.","[423, 424]"
"
6.5. Descriptive genitive phrases
A genitive phrase consisting of a noun possessor followed by the possessive
pronoun wu- may follow a noun as a modifying phrase. The pronoun agrees
in number and gender with the head noun. Note that this is essentially the
same structure as the ordinal numeral construction described in section 6.3.2
above. In its ordinary use as the pronominal head of a genitive construction
(see section 6.2.3, where numerous examples are given) wu- agrees with an
antecedent in number and gender. It means then '(the) one(s) belonging to
X' where X is the genitive possessor. Of course the construction covers
much more than legal possession of property, and such phrases as nißjyii '
wüyi the one (gender 1 singular, speaking of the head tax) of this year' and
lwoh6 wddr6 'the ones (gender 4, speaking of honeycombs) of (i.e. with)
liquid' are common. If such a phrase is placed in apposition to a noun, with
the wu- pronoun agreeing with that noun, the construction under discussion
is obtained.
  Over half of the examples collected so far have pronoun heads. No other
means is available to modify such heads using nouns (recall that adjectives
are constructed solely from adjective or verb roots). The construction is very
                                          6.5. Descriptive genitive phrases   229versatile, and frequently difficult to translate succinctly into English. Most
commonly the modifying noun, syntactically the possessor of the wu- pro-
noun, is indefinite, an indication that it is not referential in any way, but is
being used descriptively. The wu- itself may be definite or indefinite:  (104)   a. Mu niticüü-wd            \νύ    bä

             that he died here?' More naturally: 'Wasn't it during my
             second year in the army that he died here?'","[251, 252]"
"8.  While the vast majority of uses of the narrative auxiliary have past time
    reference, it is not strictly accurate to say this is part of its meaning,
    since a narrative marked with it may be embedded in a conditional.
9. There are two rivals for the honor: taha 'set down (for some purpose)'
    and tege 'help'. The first of these has the right consonants and vowels,
    but it is strong mid tone, whereas the grammaticalized verb is weak
    mid. The second has the right tone, and is also favored because for at
    least some speakers an alternate pronunciation of the grammaticalized
    verb is tegs. In fact, these two verbs are probably themselves related.
    Both Cebaara and Sucite have high tone verbs (recall that high is prob-
    ably the historical source of weak mid) with the vowel [ε] meaning
    'put' or 'place': Cebaara ίέ?έ 'put' (French mettrer, Mills 1987: 352),
    Sucite tixί (Garber 1987: 365). Significantly, the Sucite verb also
    means 'help'. In addition, Cebaara has a verb tägä 'believe', which,
    given the widespread use of a single verb to mean 'put down' and
    'believe' in the area (cf. Bambara da and Supyire yah a), must be re-
    lated. Sucite also has a mid tone verb ta?a 'put on the fire', which is
    one of the meanings of Supyire taha 'set down' (it also means 'follow',
    and 'repeat, recite'). How many proto-verbs there were, and how the
    meanings were divided up among them is unclear at present.
10. In at least one Senufo language, Karaboro, the cognate, k3 survives only
    as a benefactive postposition.
11. The to (from Bambara ton) is actually a cooperative association. Such
    associations usually have annual feasts, and the expression for
    'celebrate the feast of a cooperative society' is to tf/je, literally 'seat a
    cooperative association'.
12. Of a total of 71 adverbial     clauses in the corpus, 39 ( = 55%) have sa
    (N = 20) or pa (N = 19).
720    Notes: Chapter 9
Chapter 9: Aspect, tense, modality, and negation
1.    The only systematic exceptions are bare imperatives, ""zero"" subjunc-
      tives, reduced same subject clauses in consecutive constructions, and
      nominalizations.
2.    It should be noted that the distinction drawn by Dahl (198S) between
      morphological and periphrastic expression of ΤΑΜ categories is diffi-
      cult to maintain in Supyire. The auxiliaries seem to fall somewhere in
      between the two kinds of coding. They are used to express both those
      categories which are typically coded morphologically cross-linguisti-
      cally (e.g. past) and those that are typically coded periphrastically (e.g.
      progressive, perfect). There is no difference in complexity of coding be-
      tween these various options. The use of serial verbs, by contrast, falls
      clearly in the category of periphrasis.
3.     WZ/is one of about twenty verbs which do not have a marked imperfec-
      tive form. For other examples see chapter 4, section 4.2.5.
4.    The tonal difference between the base form lyi 'eat' and the imperfec-
      tive form lyi is neutralized following a definite noun, since the floating
      low tone from the noun docks onto the verb.
5.    If the sample of languages in Dahl (1985) is representative, this is a
      rather unusual extension of the function of the progressive. Dahl notes
      'PROG is quite infrequently extended to habitual meaning'. With the in-
      termediate step of repetitive found in Supyire, the extension does not
      seem unnatural, however. As noted in Givön (1984: 277) durative, re-
      petitive, and habitual all belong in the imperfective camp.
6.    Of a total of 613 examples of the progressive used with a verb (rather
      than with a copula, see below) found in non-procedural texts (the ΤΑΜ
      in such texts is invariably 'habitual*, though this is much more fre-
      quently marked with the habitual auxiliary mahn than with na) at least
      180 could plausibly be argued to have a habitual interpretation. This
      proportion (29%) indicates that the habitual meaning is a very important
      secondary function of the progressive.
7.    A proverb. The wild yam has a very long and tender tip (its 'nose')
      which is easily broken off when the tuber is dug up. The use of the
      auxiliary jiye in this example is due to its being a focus construction
      (see below in this section).
8.    In many languages the future is lumped with the imperfect. Givön
      (1984: 277) suggests that this is due to the inference that 'if an event
      has not yet occurred, its terminal boundary is not yet specified'. The
      progressive has not encroached much on the future in Supyire, but if the
      scenario presented here is correct, more expansion in that direction
      would not be unnatural. It should be pointed out that the progressive
      does co-occur with the future (see section 9.2.8.2 below).
                                                            Notes: Chapter 9    721
9.    This combination of the progressive with the sequential/narrative
      marker si/rfand the same subject conjunction mä is dealt with in section
      9.2.7.2 below.
10.   Länipii 'tax' is borrowed from French I'impot 'the tax'. Wähäti is bor-
      rowed from Bambara wakati 'time'.
11.   Scnufö 'Senufo' is borrowed from Bambara or French, and should not
      be taken as the source of this much-disputed word. In this example it is
      used as the equivalent of süpyir^'the people'.
12.   The sige shiinbii are an elf- or fairy-like people who inhabit the bush.
      They are very short (only about a meter tall), have long, straight, fair
      hair and light skin, and their feet are attached in the opposite direction
      to those of human beings. They inhabit trees and have considerable
      magic power.
13.   This example is taken from a folktale in which Monkey is the comman-
      dant, and Hare is his commis, or secretary. The violent incident alluded
      to occurred when Dog, enraged that Monkey had demanded taxes from
      him, decided to set the matter right. The secretary's long ears of course
      made a convenient handle with which to fling him about. Bird 'office'
      is of course borrowed from French bureau.
14.   Kirimasa 'warlord' is borrowed from Bambara kile 'war' and mäsa
      'king', ' c h i e f . The speaker is referring to the latter half of the nine-
      teenth century, when the Supyire were subjugated by Bambara-speaking
      peoples. Dipye 'world' is borrowed from Bambara diyen 'world'.
15.   Mäha [ma?a] is obviously cognate with the Cebaara past tense marker
      maa. Mills (1987) nowhere indicates that the latter can be used for ha-
      bitual aspect.
16.   A pwünpaarawa, literally a 'dog-walker', is a hunter who uses hunting
      dogs. A ntoonpcwoo 'termite pot' is a pot filled with leaves and twigs
      turned upside down over a termite nest. In the morning, when the ter-
      mites have filled the pot in their attempt to eat the leaves and twigs, the
      owner can empty ('pour') the termites into a basket and take them home
      to feed to his poultry.
17.   The event referred to took place in the childhood of the addressee, now
      an old man.
18.   The speaker is recounting the butchering of the last elephant to be seen
      in Kampwoo. The occasion was a festive one, and was accompanied by
      music played on the fikhn), a small harp-lute (both the word and the in-
      strument are borrowed from the Bambara). The players sat on a portion
      of skin taken from the elephant, in the middle of a circle of onlookers
      (fogo, borrowed from Bambara fogon, 'space surrounded by onlookers')
      and the bullets found in the meat as it was cut up were put in a pile be-
      side them. The unfortunate elephant had obviously been much shot at
      before it was finally killed.
722   Notes: Chapter 9
19. This is called the 'hodiernal' tense by some authors (cf. Dahl 1985: 125;
    Comrie 1986: 83).
20. There are several morphemes with this segmental form in Kampwo
    Supyire. The ones most likely to be confused with the future are the
    subjunctive auxiliary si and the narrative/sequential auxiliary si There
    are several ways in which these can be distinguished from the future si.
    Only the latter is accompanied by the future prefix. The subjunctive and
    the narrative are frequently reduced to rV or V, whereas the future is
    never so reduced. The subjunctive and the narrative accept a floating
    low tone from the left (i.e. from the subject) whereas the future never
    hosts a floating tone. The future si can occur in a negative clause,
    whereas the subjunctive si and the narrative never can (there is a sepa-
    rate negative subjunctive auxiliary kä). Finally, these three auxiliaries
    all combine with the progressive in distinct ways (see section 9.2.7.2).
21. This form is attested in some dialects of Cebaara and in Tagbana
    (Clamens 1952: 1425). The form used in standard Cebaara, ή, is re-
    duced through elision of the vowel rather than the consonant.
22. I have suggested elsewhere (Carlson 1989) that the dative postposition
    ά, from *mä also has the same etymology. Clamens (1952) was perhaps
    the first to make the connection between the perfect and the dative
    postposition in a Senufo language, noting that they seemed to be identi-
    cal in Tagbana. He however suggests the etymology maha 'touch'. The
    imperfectivity of ma, as well as its tone, is certainly a count against it,
    since a perfect auxiliary ought to derive from a perfective verb. How-
    ever, the history of the verb 'come' in Senufo is not at all clear. This is
    one of only two examples in Supyire in which the imperfective is de-
    rived through consonant mutation (the perfective form is pa) and the
    only one that displays the alternation of [p] with [m]. The imperfective
    ma may be suppletive rather than derived from the perfective. However,
    it should be pointed out that the perfective form in central Senufo is
    [pa], and that the proto-Senufo form was most likely *paN. The situ-
    ation is too complicated to resolve without further comparative data.
23. Cf. Dahl 1985: 125 (also Comrie 1986: 85), who points out that in some
    cases a perfect has developed into a recent (or ""earlier today"") past.
24. Note that this makes the Supyire perfect resemble zero marking in the
    Creole ΤΑΜ system, at least superficially. Compare Bickerton's (1981)
    characterization of the zero marking in Creole ΤΑΜ systems as past for
    events and present for states. His explanation for this is that these are
    the semantically unmarked time references in each case.
25. Comrie (1986: 78) argues that the pluperfect is ""radically different""
    from the perfect, and ""should not be given a uniform treatment"" with it.
    While there are differences, (Comrie lists a number ad loc.\ cf. also
    Dahl 1985: 144) this statement is rather too strong. In fact the pluper-
    fect usually is related morphologically to the perfect. This repeated
                                                          Notes: Chapter 9   111
      concurrence of form cannot be merely a coincidence, but must be due to
      a deep-seated similarity in meaning. In fact the ingredients noted in the
      preceding discussion, viz. perfectivity, current (or ""lingering""; Givön
      1984: 280) relevance, and anteriority are all characteristics which the
      pluperfect shares with the simple perfect.
26.   S6bi (frequently also pronounced s6mi), borrowed from Bambara
      sehen, means any piece of paper with writing on it, including books,
      letters, and permits. In the context here is indicates the ticket for a
      ""bush taxi"".
27.   Never/is borrowed from French ncufhcures.
28.   Fwdrdbä 'co-operative society' is borrowed from Bambara fdrdba,
      which Bailleul defines as 'bien appartenant h la communaut6'. Darashf
      'five francs 1 is borrowed from Bambara dalasi.
29.   As a main verb, ίέέ either takes a dative-experiencer subject with a pa-
      tient indirect object ( = the thing the experiencer is accustomed to), or
      the syntactic roles are reversed, with the patient as subject and the da-
      tive-experiencer as indirect object. The serial construction follows the
      first configuration in having the dative-experiencer as subject. See
      chapter 7, section 7.4.3.2 for examples.
30.   Comrie calls these tenses ""combinations of absolute tenses"". In Supyire
      they are not absolute, however, as the reference point can be in the past
      or future, as will appear below.
31.   The progressive marker here is a relic of the origin of the future auxil-
      iary as an imperfective verb.
32.   The low tone on sähä here is due to the spread of the floating low tone
      following the subject, not to the negative auxiliary.
33.   The term ""main line"" is used to denote independent clauses which en-
      code the events of the narrative in their proper chronological order. It
      thus excludes all clauses encoding background information, and all sub-
      ordinate clauses.
34.   In poetry the earlier form warf is attested.
35.   Comrie (1986: 26-28, 61, 103) also doubts that the so-called ""sequen-
      tial"" tenses actual code sequentiality. He claims that the sequentiality
      can in most if not all cases be attributed to an ""implicature"", and that it
      is not part of the meaning of the grammatical forms in question. There
      can be no rigid dividing line between ""implicature"" and ""meaning"",
      however, since in historical change yesterday's ""implicature"" often
      becomes today's ""meaning"". Certainly if the speaker regularly intends
      the hearer to draw a certain inference from a given grammatical form,
      and in fact counts on that inference being drawn (i.e. it becomes a
      ""conventional implicature""), the stage is set for the inference to become
      part of the ""meaning"" of the form. Since the narrative/sequential auxil-
      iary in Supyire can only be used under certain well-defined conditions,
      one of which is that the chronological sequence must be observed
724   Notes: Chapter 9    (events can overlap or occasionally be simultaneous, but not out of or-
    der), it seems clear that the speaker intends the hearer to understand this
    to be indicated by the use of the auxiliary.
36 See Carlson 1986 and chapter IS below for a description of the switch-
    reference system of Supyire.
37. It looks very much like the perfect marker ä (this would explain the low
    tone on the final vowel of AS/), but it is unclear how the meaning
    (sequential with middle strength thematic continuity) could be derived
    from a composition of the perfect with a non-finite form. It could be
    that the original meaning of the perfect (possibly 'come', as noted
    above) could have been at the origin of this construction.
38. The leaves referred to are dead leaves with which the yam mounds have
    been covered in order to keep in moisture till the yams sprout.
39. The subject refers to a very old man who was incapable of walking. He
    used to be brought outside and 'spread out' in the sun—the verb is the
    one used for spreading out grain or cotton to dry. Cängke is 'sunlight'
    or 'daylight', and is the common word for 'day' as well'.
40. The subject refers to a fish caught by the speaker. Supyire fishermen
    are as prone to exaggeration as fishermen elsewhere.
41. C6g6imanner, way, means' is borrowed from Bambara cogo, with the
    same meaning.
42. Occasionally one even hears [d] instead of [r] (or [s]). Since [r] is an
    allophone of /d/ in unstressed medial syllables, it is not surprising that
    some speakers, when for whatever reason they introduce a slight pause
    just after the future auxiliary, interpret the [r] that normally appears
    there as /d/.
43. To 'answer the yes' means to supply the interjections and murmers of
    assent at the end of each breath group during a monologue by another
    speaker. The speaker of this example is about to launch into a narrative,
    and wants to make sure that someone is designated to 'answer the yes'.
44. This is evidence that the original form of the auxiliary was ba.
45. Jinä is borrowed (via Bambara) from Arabic jiimiy. In the Supyire cos-
    mology it refers to tutelary spirits which inhabit streams.
46. The construction is rather similar in meaning to the French expression
     Void que...
47. Although the perfect auxiliary is written separately in this construction,
    for most speakers the vowel following the glottal stop is not in reality
    long (/nähä ä/ becomes [nä?ä]). Note that the low tone of the perfect
    auxiliary replaces the high on the final vowel of nähä.
48. Compare the similar construction with säJiä described in section 9.2.5
    above.
49. The development from 'create' to 'reputed' probably went through
    some such stage as 'imagine'. Compare the development of English fie-
                                                         Notes: Chapter 9   725
    tion from the past participle of the Latin verb fingere 'shape, fashion,
    feign'.
50. Buwara was the first inhabitant of the region including Kampwo, ac-
    cording to legend. This speaker believes, though he is not certain, that
    Buwara was a Samogo (a Mande-speaking people whose territory at
    present divides the Supyire from the central Senufo groups) who came
    from Kong, a city in northern C6te d'lvoire.
51. Ja is also used as a main verb in the common expression for 'thank
    you': Mu a jä. Literally this means 'You have overcome.'
52. Following a high tone, mä is pronounced a step lower, as if it were mid
    tone, due to downstep (see chapter 2, section 2.3.5.1). Since nothing fo-
    llows in the clause (and the tone register is generally reset during the
    pause following the m£), the terracing effect of the downstep is not felt.
    To avoid encumbering the orthography with apostrophes, therefore, the
    negative particle following a high tone is simply written as if it were
    mid, i.e. me. The same practice is followed for other high tone clause fi-
    nal particles such as the relative clause marker k6 and the interrogative
    marker be.
53. Coming at the edge of the clause as it does, this looks superficially like
    evidence for the analysis of negation as it is treated in propositional cal-
    culus, as an operator on a proposition. The placement of negative mark-
    ing at the periphery of a clause is extremely rare (see Dahl 1979), which
    Horn (1989) takes to be good evidence that such an analysis is mis-
    guided. The value of the Senufo ""evidence"" is of course considerably
    vitiated by the occurrence of negative marking in the auxiliary position
    in most tense-aspects, a placement that is cross-linguistically common.
54. Pyenga 'compound, home' has a mid-low tune, the final low of which
    floats and docks on the following negative marker.
55. Yatooro, literally 'things with legs', has the same mid-low tone tune as
    pyenga referred to in the previous note.
56. Thus in spite of its consistent clause final negative marking, Supyire
    also abides by the ""Neg First principle"" (Horn 1989: 449, quoting Jes-
    persen) to the effect that negative marking is placed first or near the
    beginning of the sentence in the interests of clearness. Without such
    early marking, of course, the hearer would be unaware that the current
    clause was negative until it was terminated.
57. Horn (1989: 190), picking up on a hint in Clark (1974), uses the term
    suppose rather than presuppose to label this ""entertainment"" of the af-
    firmative, which obviously does not qualify as presupposition in the
    strict sense. As Giv<Sn (1989) points out, the information must be as-
    sumed to be backgrounded in order for the negative to be pragmatically
    felicitous, and this same notion covers the other cases of the use of the
    combination pye na.
726    Notes: Chapter 1058. One such segmental negative auxiliary (J) appears in the speech of very
    old people in a very restricted environement (see below). Cebaara has a
    present tense negative auxiliary with low tone: d (Mills 1987).
59. The Wara is one of the three major masks of the Kampwo Supyire (the
    other two being the Komo and the Kono), and corresponds to the Nya of
    the Bambara. The sij6r6 is the annual ceremony in which the mask
    ""comes out"".
60. The cognate of this auxiliary in Sucite (yl) is apparently the common
    way of marking negation in the auxiliary position (Garber 1987: 36).
61. Siga 'doubt' is borrowed from from Bambara siga or sigi 'to doubt'.
62. Jäcyi'importance'         is borrowed from Bambara jati*to count, consider'.
63. Piteti ' m a y b e ' is borrowed from French peut-etre.
64. The etymology of the second part of the word is unknown. It may be
    related to -fyin 'white', but the tone is wrong.
65. This means that the clause must be recognizable as a relative clause on
    other grounds. The use of a relative pronoun is of course diagnostic, but
    these are used only in a minority of relative clauses. In the absence of a
    relative pronoun, the placement of a noun phrase in focus position at the
    head of the clause, coupled with the absence of the negative identifier
    which marks a negative cleft (see below), suffices to indicate a relative
    clause.
66. The copular auxiliary jiye in this example is required when the progres-
    sive occurs in a presuppositional clause, and is not the negative marker.
67. Karadanti is borrowed from French carte d'identity. The speaker is a
    student visiting the zoo in Bamako and wishing to claim the student dis-
    count on the entrance fee. A student identity card is required to obtain
    the discount, but the speaker has forgotten to bring his.
68. Since the copula ßye does not take any negative marking in auxiliary
    position, the assigning of the negation to the main clause in sentences
    like this must be by default: the complement clause is affirmative, con-
    sequently the negation must be located in the main clause.
69. It may seem odd to speak of obligation in connection with rain. This ex-
    ample, however, is taken from a discussion about rainmakers.
70. Jatigd is borrowed from Bambara jätigi 'host'. The proverb refers to the
    fact that in order to obtain a wife you must have a host in her village
    who will be your intermediary with her family.","[742, 743, 744, 745, 746, 747, 748, 749]"
"  Jd, like all other pronouns in Supyire, is not marked for case in any way:
the same form is used for subject, direct object, indirect object, and genitive: (43) a. subject, indirect object
           Jö   u      a       s)Jä      äni jö ά ye?
           who s/he PERF be.EMPH there who to Q
           'Who is actually there for whom?'
        b. direct object

           who they PERF send Q
           'Whom did they send?'
        c. genitive
           Jö   ό     cwo u $ge ye?
           who GEN wife she that Q
           'Whose wife is that?'

she believes the unknown referent to be more than one person, the combina-
tion 'who and who' can be used: (44) Jd   ni jd     u ä    pa   ye?
      who and who s/he PERF come Q
      'Who and who came?'
14.2.2.3. ßähä 'what'By the use of ßähä a speaker indicates that he or she believes the unknown
referent is non-human. It is thus appropriate that for the purposes of agree-
ment, jiähä is gender 2 singular. Note the use of the gender 2 singular pro-
noun as a place holder for the focused subject question word in the following
example:  (45) βähä ku ßye na         mu k6r6 ye?
       what it be PROG you chase.IMPFVQ
       'What is chasing you?'  ßähä is used together with the postposition na 'on' or kurugo 'along, by
means of, because o f to question the reason for something, i.e. the equiva-
lent of English 'why':  (46) a. ßähä ηά cydeb/Jä      ä       pi  bähäge               pyi
          what on women.DEF PERF their game.DEF                 do
          'Why did the women do their dance
           tooyi shuunni   ye?
           times two       Q
           twice?'
        b. ßähä kürügö       pi mäha ßtyke     yaa            ye?
           what because.of they HAB earth.DEF repair          Q
           'Why do they restore the earth?' 11  In addition to its use as a pronoun, ßähä can be used as a determiner mean-
ing 'which, what'. It differs from the more common interrogative determin-
ers (see section 14.2.2.6 below) in three ways: it precedes rather than fol-
lows the head noun, it takes an indefinite head noun rather than a definite
one, and it does not agree in any way with the head noun. In the following
examples, the noun phrase containing ßähä is an indirect (locative) object:
538   Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts  (47) a. Jlähä känhä           na mu a             ύτύ   lw5 ye?

          'In which village did you get (lit. take) her?'
        b. Jlähä klre            e mu a        ylrl     ye?
           which country(G3S) in you PERF get.up Q
           'From which country do you come?' Lit. 'In which country did
           you get up?'
14.2.2.4. dl 'how'The manner question word dl is borrowed from Bambara dl 'how'. It is usu-
ally placed in focus position, as in (48a), but occasionally is put in the posi-
tion where one would normally expect a manner phrase, viz. after the verb,
as in (48b):  (48) a. Dl   χνύύ si      J) py)       ye?
          how we FUT it do               Q

           I   REC.PAST you tell how Q
           'What did I tell you?'","[559, 560, 561]"
"  In contrast to the coreferential noun phrase in complements of modality or
manipulative verbs, whose syntactic role is restricted (to subject and direct
object, respectively), the coreferential noun phrase in indirect speech may
have any syntactic role. In view of the unpredictability of its role, the use of
the marked emphatic pronoun to indicate coreference (rather than the un-
marked anaphoric pronoun as in the other two complement types) makes
sense. The following examples show the coreferential noun phrase in a vari-
ety of syntactic roles.

"The same verbs take a realis complement (marked with a high tone on the

intended). The realis complement may be perfective, in which case it takes
the perfect auxiliary έ, or imperfective, in which case it takes the reduced
form of the progressive auxiliary: (3) a. perfective complement

5.7.1. Simple adpositions  There are eight simple postpositions. I have argued elsewhere (see Carlson
1989) that most of these derive historically from verbs. They behave tonally
like transitive verbs preceded by a direct object. Some of them are quite old,
going back to proto-Senufo and beyond. Others are of more recent origin,
and are shared by only a few other Senufo languages. Some of the older
postpositions show the ravages of time in phonological erosion. These have
lost their initial consonants, and are reduced to being mere vowel clitics on
the noun phrases they mark. The dative marker ά 'to, for, from' comes from
ηιάΛ a form still encountered in poetry. The locative / comes from *ni, which
is the form found in other Senufo languages. Table 24 gives the simple post-
positions.
                                                             5.7. Adpositioas   179                          Table 24. Simple postpositions                      Postposition          Gloss                          i                to, for, from

translations. This is because much of the information associated with prepo-
sitions in English is carried in the verb in Supyire.30 Thus the verb indicates
direction of motion, and the postposition merely codes abstract location.
Compare the following, all using the postposition i (for the alternation [i/e]
in this postposition, see chapter 2, section 2.2.2.6): (50) a. U pye bag6              e.
         s/he be house.DEF in

           s/he PERF go     Sikasso to
           'S/he has gone to Sikasso.*  As noted above, there are three prepositions in Supyire. All of them are re-
lated to conjunctions with other functions in the language. All of them may
and one of them must be accompanied by a postposition as well. Table 25
gives these details.
  Νά 'with' is historically related to and has the same form as the noun
phrase conjunction nä*and'. As a preposition it must be accompanied by the
postposition i 'with'. 31 Although the latter looks identical to the locative
postposition / 'in, at', it is not. The locative postpositon has strong mid tone,
whereas i 'with' has weak mid tone. The tone rules are such that the two al-
most never have the same tone in a given context. The combination na...i is
used to code both associative and instrument, as shown in (51).
