  As well, human nouns that express generic reference such as óìà/éèà ‘human being, person’ fail to
take a li complement: *óíá lì kéré [person R younger] ‘younger human being,’ *ééá lì kéré [persons R
younger] younger human being.’19
  Additional human propensity adjectives are: ómóhé lì bùmèbúmé [man R haggard.and.worn out]
‘haggard man,’ óvbékhán lì tùzètúzé [youth R underweight.and.dirty] ‘an unkempt youth,’ and
ómóhé lì sènèséné [man R repulsive / very.ugly] ‘an ugly man.’Not all human propensity adjectives appear as attributive phrases; the form húré ‘pompous’ requires
a relative clause.ómóhé lí ó ò ù húré                             *ómóhé lì húré

  Never serving as li complement is the abstract noun àtà ‘truth’: *émí lì àtà [thing R true] ‘true
thing,’ *ókhá lì àtà [story R true] ‘true story.’23
   Age attributives fail with common noun heads that are human. Instead, analytic compounds
consisting of a human noun followed by an age noun refer to adult (not nonadult) standing in socie-
ty rather than age relative to the immediate moment.*ómóhé lí ódíòn                                   ómóhódíòn

  With either count or mass noun head, Relator li is optional. Nonetheless under this free variation
condition, meaning of the phrase and tone on the head noun (spread of high tone) are identical:
ímóhé (lì) ògbèré [men R plentiful] ‘a lot of men,’ ékén (lì) ògbèré [sand R plentiful] ‘a lot of sand.’25
  Collective and distributive numeral complements follow third person plural pronouns: íyáín lì èvá
[they R two] ‘both of them / group of two,’ and ìyàìn èvá [they two] ‘two of them.’26
  As a final comment, instances where phrases with collective and attribution interpretations might
be expected to co-occur, each marked by Relator li with a place or human noun in head position, fail
to do so: *íwé lì èvá lì kéré [house R two R small.size] ‘group of two small-sized houses’; *íwé lì kéré lì
èvá [house R small.size R two] ‘group of two small-sized houses’;*ímóhé lì èélè lì kéré [men R four R
small.size] ‘group of four small-sized men’; *ímóhé lì kéré lì èélè [men R small.size R four] ‘group of
four small-sized men.’27
     Pronominally headed relative clauses show a plural shape with élí in head position.(i) élí é      nwú'      émà lí    ònwìmè, é       fí'       áwá údò.
    ones they PAP.take yam APP farmer they PRP.hit dog stone
    ‘As for the ones who gave yam to the farmer, they hit a dog with a stone.’28
  Pronominally headed relative clauses also occur in Emai. They fail to show Relator li, and they are
headed by a relative pronoun denoting either an animate (ólí), inanimate (émé') or place (ébé')
236 | Noun modifiersreferent (Chapter 5, 5.8). Relative pronouns uniformly show high tone or high tone followed by high
downstep.(i) a. ólí ólí ómóhé záwó'
       one the man PAP.see
       ‘the one who the man saw’
    b. émé' ólí ókpósó dé'-ì
       what the woman PAP.buy-F
       ‘what the woman bought’
    c. ébé' ólí ókpósó ó'-ì
       where the woman PAP.enter-F
       ‘where the woman entered’29
  Deictic time nominals (òdè, ákhò and éènà) serving as temporal adjuncts (òdè in ólí ómóhé fí ólí
áwá údó òdè ‘The man hit the dog with a stone yesterday’) never relativize.(i) *ódé        lí ólí ómóhé fí'     ólí áwá údó gbó'           tèè.
     yesterday R the man PAP.hit the dog stone PAP.ADD be.long
     ‘Yesterday when the man hit the dog with a stone was also long.’30
  As a further note, ambiguity as to phrase head can occur in constructions with genitive phrase
and relative clause. In (i) relative clause head preceding Relator li could be possessum úríáí or pos-
sessor óvbéé; either could serve as direct object of shen ‘sell’ and thus as head of the relative clause.(i) úríáí ísì óvbéé lí ójé shén-ì
    tail ASS monkey R Oje sell-F
    ‘tail of the monkey that Oje sold’
5 Pronouns and conjunction
Emai pronouns express relations relative to linguistic or situational context. They
reflect five basic types: personal, bound (anaphoric), interrogative, locative and
impersonal. Exponents of these types can reflect case, person, number, gender,
and/or definiteness. In characterizing Emai grammatical structure, both overt pro-
noun and zero (gapped) pronoun prove useful.
     Zero pronoun is illustrated by the syntactic position following the transitive
verb nwu ‘take.’ This verb is subcategorized for a direct object. nwu takes a pronoun
(e.g. óì ‘it’) in the absence of a lexical noun. In series with another verb (e.g. hian
‘cut’), as well as in other structural patterns, nwu also takes a zero pronoun.(1) a. ólí ókpósó ló     nwú óì ní émè.
       the woman PRED take it APP me
       ‘The woman will give it to me.’
    b. ólí ókpósó ló     hìàn éànmì nwú ní émè.
       the woman PRED cut meat take APP me
       ‘The woman will cut meat in order to give it to me.’5.1 Definite personal pronouns
Definite personal pronouns reflect person (first, second or third), number (singular
and plural), case (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) and discourse status
(emphatic).

pronouns varies according to aspect, mood, or polarity features of the clause (Chap-
ter 3, 3.1.1). Tone can also vary on other pronouns as grammatical features interact
throughout a clause.(2) ìyàìn lí yán nwú'        óì ní émé vbí íwé     ísì èé.
    they PF they PAP.take it APP me LOC house ASS your
    ‘It was they who gave it to me in your house.’Restrained by case, number and person, personal pronouns refer to participants in
the situational or linguistic context. Third person subject forms (ó ‘she’) can co-refer
to a noun phrase in a preceding sentence.(3) ólì òkpòsò míé     òhí. ó ó             vbì ìwè.
    the woman PRP.see Ohi she PAP.enter LOC house
    ‘The woman1 saw Ohi. She1 entered the house.’In complex sentences containing two or more clauses, nominative pronouns (ó)
express co-reference to a lexical antecedent (áléké) in a preceding clause. They tend
not to co-refer to a noun phrase in a following clause. This condition obtains regard-
less of whether the pronoun occurs in the main or subordinate clause of a complex
sentence.(4) a. bí áléké ré'         míé òhí, ó ó'            vbì ìwè.

        she PAP.enter LOC house as Aleke PAP.CONC see Ohi
        ‘Shei entered the house, when Alekei saw Ohi.’     For third person plural subject, e and yan exponents occur in complementary
distribution. Plural e tends not to co-refer to a noun phrase across a sentence
boundary; instead, it co-refers within a clause. In contrast, plural yan co-refers to a
noun phrase within or across sentences.(5) a. élí ívbèkhàn yé             ògò. yán gbé'        ófè.
       the youths    PRP.move.to bush they PAP.kill rat
       ‘The youths went to the bush. They killed rats.’
    b. *élí ívbèkhàn yé             ògò. é     gbé'      ófè.
        the youths    PRP.move.to bush they PAP.kill rat
       ‘The youths went to the bush. They killed rats.’In addition, distribution of third person plural subject forms yan and e is controlled
by matrix clause aspect and structural position. Plural e is restricted to perfect as-
pect. It never occurs in clauses inflected for imperfect, as yan does. Plural third per-
son e is limited to subject position relative to an antecedent in the same clause or
sentence; yan is not. When a plural noun appears in discourse relevant topic, focus,
antitopic (right dislocated), question or relative clause position and the matrix
clause inflects for perfect aspect, e or yan appears as subject.(6) a. élí ívbèkhàn, é / yán gbé'             ólí ófè.
       the youths      they they PAP.kill the rat
       ‘As for the youths, they killed the rat.’
    b. élí ívbèkhàn lí é / yán gbé'            ólí ófè.

       ‘They killed the rat, that is the youths.’
    d. éé' é      / éí' yán híán'          ólí óràn?

       ‘Who cut the wood?’
    e. élí    é    / yán rì           vbí édà úé-ì.
       ones they they PAP.be LOC river PRP.be.lost-F
       ‘The ones who are in the river are lost.’
240 | Pronouns and conjunctionWhen a plural noun appears in discourse relevant topic, focus, antitopic (right dis-
located), question or relative clause position and the matrix clause is inflected for
imperfect aspect, yan occupies subject position. e never does, as topic and focus
li/ni constructions suggest.(7) a. ívbèkhàn, yán à / *é è gbè ófè.
       youths       they H      they H kill rat
       ‘As for youths, they kill rats.’
    b. ívbèkhàn lí yán à / *é è gbè ófè.
       youths      PF they H       they H kill rat
       ‘It is youths who kill rats.’When the third person plural emphatic pronoun appears in focus or topic position
linked to a matrix clause inflected for perfect aspect, subject position accepts only
yan, not e.(8) a. ìyàìn lí yán / *é       gbé'      ólí ófè.
       they PF they they PAP.kill the rat
       ‘It was they who killed the rat.’
    b. ìyàìn, yán / *é      gbé'      ólí ófè.
       they they they PAP.kill the rat
       ‘As for them, they killed the rat.’Within S-complements (marked by Indicative khi for example, Chapter 13, 13.2.1),
subject position under perfect aspect accepts yan or e, with yan showing ambiguity
between personal (disjoint reference vis-à-vis subject élí ímóhé) and logophoric
(conjoint reference vis-à-vis élí ímóhé) interpretations. In contrast, e offers only a
disjoint interpretation.(9) élí ímóhé ré'         é khì yàn / è           gbé      ólí ófè.
    the men PAP.CONC say IND they            they PRP.kill the rat
    ‘The men said that they killed the rat.’     Of the personal pronouns, only emphatic forms appear with postdeterminer
modifiers. Emphatic pronouns for each person occur with emphatic partitive òkpá
‘alone.’ No emphatic pronoun, however, co-occurs with the definite predeterminer
(*élì ìyàìn ‘the they’).mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn            / màmàì / vbàvbà / ìyàìn òkpá
I          you      he / she/ it we         you   they alone

person plural allow postdeterminers from quantity, demonstrative and attributive
classes. The third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts the greatest range of
modifiers. It is found with cardinal or collective numeral modifiers but not distribu-
tive or ordinal numeral modifiers.ìyàìn èvá ‘two of them’                 íyáín lì èvá ‘both of them, both’

 they two.each (distributive)            they R secondThe third person plural emphatic pronoun combines with univeral quantifiers (col-
lective èrèmé, distributive òdóòdé) but not existential quantifiers (partitive ésò,
contrastive évbèé).íyáín èrèmé ‘all of them’                íyáín òdóòdé ‘each of them’
they all                                 they each

 they certain                            they otherAnd the third person plural emphatic pronoun allows demonstrative proximal nà
but not distal áìn or contrastive nóì.íyáín nà ‘this very they’               *íyáín nóì ‘the next very they’
they this                                they next
*íyáín áìn ‘that very they
 they thatThe third person plural emphatic never accepts kindred modifiers, neither deictic
élìyó (*íyáín élìyó [they that.kind] ‘they of that kind’) nor contrastive édàn (*íyáín
édàn [they different.kind] ‘they of a different kind’).
     Relative to postnominal modifier types designated by a grammatical morpheme,
the third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts Relator li attributive phrases but
not relative clauses (*íyáín lí ójé shén' lí ókpósó [they R Oje PAP.sell APP woman]
‘they that Oje sold to the woman’) or Associative ísì phrases (*íyáín ísì òjè [they ASS
Oje]‘those of Oje’).íyáín lí óbín' ‘they that dark’
they R dark
242 | Pronouns and conjunctionThe third person singular emphatic pronoun is more restricted than its plural coun-
terpart. As shown earlier, the singular form combines only with emphatic partitive
òkpá ‘alone.’ The singular emphatic fails to combine with numeral òkpá ‘one.’ìyòìn òkpá ‘he alone’                    *ìyòìn òkpá ‘one he’
he alone                                  he    oneAlso quite limited are first and second person plural emphatic pronouns. They only
combine with universal quantifiers: collective èrèmé and distributive òdóòdé.vbávbá èrèmé ‘all of you, you all’       vbávbá òdóòdé ‘each of you’
you    all                               you    each

we    all                                we     each5.2 Expletive and indefinite pronouns
Emai subject position shows both an expletive and an indefinite pronoun. Expletive
o occurs in relation to an extraposed complement clause. Although an embedded S-
complement can serve as logical subject, it is obligatorily extraposed to clause final
position. Its grammatical subject position is held by expletive pronoun o.(10) a. ò hùnmé                 khì òjè gbé        ólí ényè.
        it PRP.be.fortuitous IND Oje PRP.kill the snake
        ‘It is fortuitous that Oje killed the snake.’
     b. *khì òjè gbé         ólí ényè húnmé.
         IND Oje PRP.kill the snake PRP.be.fortuitous
         ‘That Oje killed the snake is fortuitous.’   Subject position also shows indefinite pronoun a ‘one.’ If not translated by the
English passive, it is rendered with indefinite plural ‘they’ or ‘one’ in active voice.(11) á    gbé'      ólí ófè.
     one PAP.kill the rat
     ‘One / They killed the rat / The rat was killed.’Indefinite a never occupies nonsubject grammatical positions such as direct or indi-
rect object, or discourse-defined positions like focus or topic.1

         ‘It was one that killed the rat.’Indefinite a is limited to subject positions subcategorized for human noun agentives
or experiencers, as grammatical gbe above illustrates. It is not licensed by stative
verbs (ri, da) or motion verbs (o, ye), which otherwise allow a human noun subject.(13) a. *à ríì          vbì ìwè.

     d. *à yé                 ìwè.
         one PRP.move.to house
         ‘One moved toward the house.’Indefinite subject a occurs with transitive verbs requiring experiencer subjects.
However, it does so only in negative constructions.(14) a. á    ì     èén khí ólì òkpòsò sá            ólí ómòhè.

         ‘One knew that the woman shot the man.’Indefinite a never co-refers across sentences, across clause boundaries within a
complex sentence or across clauses embedded within one another.

         ‘The youthsi knew that theyi killed the rat.’    Two nominal forms that in some constructions exhibit a placeholder function in
lieu of pronouns are émì ‘thing’ and óìà ‘person, human being.’ émì refers to non-
human entities. It occurs as second object in a double object complement when a
specific referent is required but not named (e.g. émì ‘something’ ~ úkpóràn ‘stick’),
as also happens in subject and direct object positions. Nonetheless, émì never oc-
curs as indirect object following Applicative li/ni or as first object in a double object
construction, both of which require human nouns.(16) a. ólì òkpòsò fí        ólí óvbékhán émì / úkpóràn.

ly with the universal quantifier òdóòdé, which only combines with human nouns.ólí émì ‘the thing’                      émí nóì         ‘the next thing’

Genitive or possessor pronouns follow Associative ísì but they also appear in associ-
ative phrases without ísì. Omission of ísì is controlled by possessor number and
person. First and third person pronouns act uniformly while second person reveals a
split distribution, singular èé ‘you’ behaving like third person, and plural àvbá ‘you’
like first person. Under ísì omission, the possessor pronoun assumes direct object
rather than genitive form.
     Alienable possession phrases with pronoun possessors display two patterns
concerning ísì omission. With first person and second person plural and first person
singular, ísì is optional.ópíá    ísì èmé / àmáí / àvbá           ópíá mè / màì / vbà
cutlass ASS my our        your          cutlass my our your
‘my / our / your cutlass’               ‘my / our / your cutlass’With third person singular and plural as well as second person singular in alienable
relations, ísì is obligatory.ópíá     ísì òí / èé / ìyáín            *ópíá     óì / é / íyàìn
cutlass ASS his your their               cutlass his your their
‘his / your / their cutlass’             ‘his / your / their cutlass’

tern. When the possessor exponent is first person singular or plural, or second per-
son plural, ísì is optional.áwé ísì èmé / àmáí / àvbá              áwé mè / màì / vbá

‘my leg’                               ‘my leg’    For inalienable relations, when possessor is third person singular, second per-
son singular or third person plural, ísì is obligatory.óé ísì òí / èé                         *óé óì / é
leg ASS his your                        leg his your

legs ASS their                          legs their
‘their legs’                            ‘their legs’    The syntactic realization of inalienable possession within a sentence, and hence
the syntactic realization of genitive pronouns, is controlled by referential identity
between possessor and grammatical subject, verb type (physical event vs cognitive
event) and alienability relation.
    Within its clause, grammatical subject constrains appearance of pronoun pos-
sessor, although only for inalienable relations. Where referential identity exists
between inalienable possessor and grammatical subject, i.e. conjoint reference, the
possessor constituent (òí) and its ísì governor are disallowed.(18) ólí ómòhè gbáló     óbò / *óbó ísì òí.
     the man PRP.wrap hand hand ASS his
     ‘The mani wrapped hisi hand / wrapped his own hand.’Where non-identity, i.e. disjoint reference, obtains between subject and possessor,
an ísì phrase with a genitive pronoun complement is obligatory.(19) ólí ómòhè gbáló        óbó ísì òí.
     the man     PRP.wrap hand ASS his
     ‘The mani wrapped hisj hand.’
248 | Pronouns and conjunctionPhrases where possessor precedes possessa (external possession, Chapter 4,
4.3.3.1.1) never allow an identity relation between possessor and grammatical sub-
ject. Non-identity is required.(20) ólí ómòhè gbáló      óí óbò.
     the man PRP.wrap his hand
     ‘The mani wrapped hisj hand.’     Conditions governing possessor expression with inalienable possessa apply to
direct object and locative goal positions. Conjoint reference leads to absence of both
ísì and possessor pronoun, while disjoint reference conditions presence of ísì and its
possessor pronoun (òí).(21) a. ólí ómòhè híán        àwè.
        the man PRP.cut legs
        ‘The mani cut hisi legs.’
     b. ólí ómòhè híán        àwè ísì òì.

        ‘The mani cut hisj / *hisi legs.’

        the woman PRP.cast shoes CL LOC feet ASS her
        ‘The womani put shoes on herj feet.’    Alienable possessa are not similarly constrained. Whether conjoint or disjoint
reference obtains between grammatical subject and possessor, possessor and ísì are
obligatory. Absence of ísì and its complement encode a nonpossession relation.(22) a. ólì òkpòsò gbé         ákhé ísì òì á.
        the woman PRP.break pot ASS her CS
        ‘The womani broke herj / heri own pot.’
     b. ólì òkpòsò gbé         ákhè á.
        the woman PRP.break pot CS
        ‘The womani broke a / *heri pot.’Inalienable possession noun phrases, regardless of conjoint or disjoint reference
between possessor and grammatical subject, are disallowed in indirect object posi-
tion marked by li/ni.

Emai shows three bound pronouns co-referring to a preceding noun phrase. Reflex-
ive and Reciprocal must have their antecedent in the same clause. Logophoric pro-
noun antecedents cannot be in the same clause.
    Logophoric (LOG) pronouns are employed in narrative discourse to track gram-
matical subject of a communication or cognition verb (Chapter 13, 13.3.3). Limited to
third person, logophoric pronouns reflect case (subject/non-subject grammatical
relations) and number (singular/plural). Their form does not distinguish between
nonsubject position and positions defined by discourse status (i.e. focus or topic).","[260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275]"
"Cultural and Linguistic BackgroundEmai is mother tongue for approximately 25,000–35,000 members of the Emai clan
in south central Nigeria. It is spoken in ten villages across roughly 250 square kilo-
meters on the plateau between the Edion and Owan rivers of present-day Edo State.
Located at longitude 6° east of Greenwich Meridian and latitude 7° north of the
equator, this area consists primarily of tree savanna, allowing for bush agriculture
involving the harvesting of yam, maize, cassava, and beans among other crops
(Bradbury 1957). Serving as the principal political village of the Emai is Afuze. Other
villages in the clan are Eteye, Evbiame-New-Site, Evbiame-Old-Site, Ogute, Ojavun-
New-Site, Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhunmi, Ovbionwu, and Uanhumi.
     The Emai-speaking region is approximately 120 kilometers north of Benin City
by road. It is connected in the south to Sabongida, the principal village of the relat-
ed Ora clan, in the east to Uzebba, the primary village of the related Iuleha clan, and
in the north to Auchi, the headquarters of the Edoid language Yekhee.
     As for the Emai people, oral tradition makes clear the absence of hereditary
chieftancy, a cultural feature frequent among Edoid peoples of its region. According
to oral tradition (Ogbomo 1994), the ancestor of the Emai people is Ima. He is said to
have fled from the ancient kingdom of Benin in about the 16th Century for commit-
ting murder. Ima and his wife, who also came from Benin, had a son Uzuanbi (Oyai-
bi). Uzuanbi, in turn, had two wives, Odidi and Oron, whose sons founded the Emai
speaking villages. Oral tradition varies at this point. According to one version, the
four sons of Uzuanbi and his wives were Uwuno, Urule, Ivbiame, and Uanhumi,
each of whom founded a village. Their sons, Uzuanbi's grandsons, founded the ten
quarters into which the four villages became divided. According to another version,
the village of Uanhumi is named after the son of one wife and the remaining villages
are related to three sons of a second wife. The sons were Uule, Evbiame and
Ovbionwu, whose names are retained, respectively, by the village sites of Ugbuule,
Evbiame-Old-Site, and Ovbionwu, all of which are located off the main Ora-Auchi
road and tend to be northernmost in their respective village groups. Each of these
villages serves to link the remaining Emai-speaking area. Villages in the Uule group,
from south to north, are: Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhumi, Eteye, Uanhumi, Afuze,
Ojavun-New-Site. Ugbuule no longer exists as an occupied village. The Evbiame
group from south to north consists of Evbiame-New-Site, Ogute, and Evbiame-Old-
Site. The Ovbionwu group consists solely of Ovbionwu.
     As a linguistic entity, Emai is completely surrounded by Edoid speech varieties.
Its genetic classification as a distinct linguistic unit within Edoid is of recent origin.
Elugbe (1973) classified it as part of a dialect cluster incorporating adjacent Ora
                                                                          Preface | ix(30,000 speakers) and Iuleha (45,000 speakers); Elugbe (1989) locates this cluster
more specifically within the North Central Branch of Edoid. While a word list sup-
porting a cluster relationship among these dialects was not published, broader clas-
sificatory schemes have accepted the cluster interpretation, e.g. Hansford, Bendor-
Samuel and Stanford (1976), Bendor-Samuel (1989) and Crozier and Blench (1992).
Even Christian missionary activity in the area has never generated word lists, since
neither the Bible nor a church hymnal is available in Emai.
     Linguistic investigation of individual languages within the Edoid group is ex-
tremely limited. Other than Emai, no descriptive grammatical treatment, encom-
passing reference grammar, lexicon, and texts, has appeared for a single member of
the 25 or more Edoid languages. Perhaps the most widely recognized comparative
and historical analysis of the Edoid group is Elugbe's (1973) unpublished disserta-
tion “A Comparative Edo Phonology” and its successor, Comparative Edoid: Phonol-
ogy and Lexicon (Elugbe 1989). Also showing an exclusive interest in phonological
matters is Elimelech's (1979) A Tonal Grammar of Etsako, which examines the role of
pitch differences in words and short phrases among dialects of Yekhee spoken
northeast of Emai country.
     Among other Edoid studies, Thomas (1910) presents a highly schematic gram-
matical and lexical analysis of Bini, the numerically and culturally dominant lan-
guage of the group since establishment of the influential Edo Kingdom in the 13th
Century (Ryder 1969). Later studies of Bini amplify portions of this initial analysis.
Melzian (1937) is a descriptive dictionary from which one can infer grammatical
information at the level of parts of speech, while Amayo (1976) and Wescott (1962)
offer accounts of Bini phonology and morphology. Several linguistic studies of Bini
in pedagogical or descriptive formats have followed. Dunn's (1968) An Introduction
to Bini is a training manual prepared for the American Peace Corps and as such
couches most of its language material in a limited variety of dialogue formats for the
prospective volunteer. An additional pedagogically oriented study is An Edo-English
Dictionary by Agheyisi (1986), which is intended for use in primary and secondary
schools. Stewart (1998) provides a theoretical interpretation of selected serial verb
constructions in Bini.
     Additional linguistic studies of Edoid speech varieties tend to be descriptive.
Ejele (1986) provides an overview of selected syntactic issues in Esan. Kari (1997)
provides a brief grammatical sketch of the Delta Edoid language Degema, which is
followed by a more detailed and illustrated descriptive grammar (2004).
     As for Emai, an initial lexicon and orthographic statement is offered by Schaefer
(1987), while Egbokhare (1990) presents an initial phonological analysis. An exten-
sive collection of Emai oral tradition texts is found in Oral Tradition Narratives of the
Emai People, Parts I and II (Schaefer and Egbokhare 1999b). This is complemented
more recently by A Dictionary of Emai: An Edoid Language of Nigeria (Schaefer and
Egbokhare 2007). Additional information on Emai is available in a number of papers
x | Prefaceby Schaefer and Egbokhare published in a variety of books and journal articles. Of
particular relevance to the future of Emai as a spoken medium is Schaefer and Eg-
bokhare (1999a), which found an intergenerational shift to English as home lan-
guage in the mid-1990s without a commensurate negative evaluation of vernacular
mother tongue.

1 Orthography and grammatical overview
Emai has no written tradition except as introduced in an initial orthographic state-
ment by Schaefer (1987) and utilized in the text collection of Schaefer and Egbo-
khare (1999) and a dictionary by Schaefer and Egbokhare (2007). To maintain some
consistency in discussion of linguistic issues in Emai, we follow the practice estab-
lished by these earlier works, although some changes regarding tone marking are
noted below. In general, segment representations follow conventions for Nigerian
languages set out in Williamson (1984) and adapted for Emai.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"

     Stop sounds occur at four places of articulation: bilabial, alveolar, velar, and
labiovelar. Fricatives articulate at four places: labiodental, alveolar, palatal and
velar. There are affricate sounds at only alveopalatal. Approximants appear at five
places of articulation: bilabial, alveolar, palatal, labiovelar and glottal. They show
allophonic relationships with nasal consonants at four places: bilabial, alveolar,
palatal and labiovelar. Alternation in three instances is conditioned by a nasal vow-
el (‘vb’~‘m,’ ‘w’~‘nw,’ and ‘y’~‘ny’) and in one instance by syntactic positioning
and/or syntactic category (‘l’~‘n’, Chapter 9, 9.1). The two approximants ‘h’ and ‘r’
fail to alternate with nasal consonants.
      In the following lexemes, stop sounds occur word initially.

Emai is a terraced-level tone language showing high, low, and down-stepped high.
For some word classes, inherent tone values distinguish words that in all other as-
pects of sound shape are identical. Nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs in
citation form express lexical meanings through tonal contrasts. Citation forms of
verbs, auxiliaries, and adverbial preverbs generally exhibit no tonal contrast, as
with other Edoid languages (Elugbe 1989). Emai verbs, auxiliaries, and preverbs are
assigned tone values reflecting grammatical properties of their constructions. In
large part these values correlate with the categories indicative and subjunctive
mood. More specifically, major patterns of tonal contrast derive from aspect (per-
fect, imperfect and prospective), modality (deontic and epistemic) and sentence
complement type.
     For Emai words composed of identical segments, predominantly nouns and ad-
verbs, tone values play a distinguishing role. Emai's high (H), down-stepped high
(!H) and low (L) tones combine in various ways within otherwise identical lexical
nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs. In orthographic practice, high tone is
                                   Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography | 5represented by an acute accent, low tone by a grave accent, and down-stepped high
by an acute accent immediately followed by a single quote. The last of these tones is
one pitch step lower than an immediately preceding high tone.ódòn                  òdón                   òkpá                   òkpà

‘vomit’                ‘fist’                ‘monkey’               ‘trickery’    Various combinations of tone occur within lexical items. An initial high tone
vowel immediately followed by a consonant can be followed by a low tone, a high
tone, or a down-stepped high.áwà [ H L ]                ónóì [ H H L ]                     éghó' [ H !H ]
‘dog’                      ‘another’                          ‘money’A word initial low tone vowel followed by a consonant is followed by either a low or
high tone vowel.ìwè [ L L ]                             ùgín [ L H ]
‘house’                                 ‘basket’Downdrift () affects non-initial high tone, lowering the latter's pitch when preced-
ed by a low tone.ódùdú [ H L H ]                        íkèké [ H L H ]
‘shadow’                                ‘bicycle’1.4 Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography
Major word classes tend to reflect contrasting syllable structures, although no abso-
lute relation exists between category type and syllable character. All parts of speech
are vowel final. Nouns are uniformly vowel-initial. Verbs tend to be consonant ini-
tial, with a few being vowel initial. Adjectives are usually consonant initial, whereas
adverbs are either vowel- or consonant initial. Of the minor categories, some are
predominantly consonant initial with a few vowel initial forms (preverbs, postverbal
particles, complements). Other minor categories are vowel initial (determiners) with
a few consonant initial forms (intensifiers). The preposition class is consonant ini-
tial. Concord expression is vowel only with fixed tone patterns.
      In pronunciation, the syllabic character of word classes in phrasal or clausal
constructions is normally adjusted by one or another phonological process: vowel
6 | Orthography and grammatical overviewelision or glide formation. These processes lead to a divergence between the ortho-
graphic practice of employing citation forms and normal-rate pronunciation ren-
dered phonetically. Regardless of phonetic transformation through glide formation
or vowel elision, orthographic practice retains vowel segments in all word classes.
     Glide formation affects the close vowels [i] and [u] when they precede non-close
vowels within a lexical or syntactic constituent. These vowels alternate with the
glides [y] and [w], respectively, as illustrated by the verbs fi and ku when followed
by a noun phrase.fí    ópìà [fyópìà]                     kú    àmè [kwàmè]
throw cutlass                           throw water     Under specific grammatical conditions, the vowel elision process omits a mor-
pheme-final vowel. Elision differentially affects word classes, revealing complex
interactions between phonological and syntactic parameters. Vowel elision applica-
tion is restricted across major syntactic constituents like subject/predicate and pred-
icate/adverb. In normal pronunciation of the sentence below, neither the final vow-
el of the subject noun ókpósó ‘woman’ nor the initial vowel of the verb éhén
‘prepare’ elide. Similarly, neither the final vowel of the direct object ákhé ‘pot’ nor
the initial vowel of the adverb òdè ‘yesterday’ elide. However, the final vowel of the
predeterminer ólì ‘the’ elides, as does the final vowel of the verb éhén.ólí ókpósó éhén'        ákhé òdè. [ólókpósó éhán'khé òdè]
the woman PAP.prepare pot yesterday
‘The woman prepared a pot yesterday.’Vowels juxtaposed due to discourse repositioning of constituents are not elided. The
final vowel of noun áwà ‘dog,’ when in clause-initial topic position, is not omitted
relative to the initial vowel of following élì ‘the.’ólí áwà, élí ímòhè khú            óì. [óláwà élímòhè khú óì]
the dog the men PRP.chase it
‘As for the dog, the men chased it.’    Vowel elision in pronunciation reflects three phonetic patterns that become
transparent most easily with transitive verb phrases. When a lexical direct object
immediately follows a consonant initial verb with a single vowel, the final vowel of
the verb is omitted, while the initial vowel of the direct object is retained. Ortho-
graphic representation shows both vowels nonetheless, as shown by comparing
orthographic representations to square bracketed broad phonetic representations.

kill dog                                buy woodVerbs defined by a single nasal vowel reflect a second pattern. In pronunciation, the
vowel itself is omitted but its nasal quality is retained and assumed by the initial
vowel of the ensuing noun phrase. Again, phonetic and orthographic representa-
tions diverge.sén áwà [sánwà]                         tón ímòhè [tínmòhè]
stab dog                                bury menStill a third phonetic pattern is exhibited by verbs with a sequence of identical vow-
els (koo ‘read’). In pronunciation, the sequence shortens when a lexical direct object
follows; it does not elide entirely. Comparison to a single vowel verb (ko ‘plait’)
illustrates the contrast. Orthographic presentation of each verb is consistent with its
citation form.kóó ébè [kóébè]                         kó    émà [kémà]
read book                               plant yamLastly, verb final vowels do not elide when followed by a pronominal direct object.sá óì [sáóì]                            gbé óì [gbéóì]
fetch it                                kill it     Orthographic and broad phonetic representations exhibit varying degrees of
congruency in the case of word formation. Since both vowel elision and glide for-
mation are evident in the pronunciation of compounds and nominalizations, identi-
fication of morpheme elements is often obscured by vowel omission. To maintain
some level of morpheme transparency in orthographic practice, elided vowels in
compounds and nominalizations are accounted for in two ways.
     Nominalized word forms in pronunciation exhibit no major incongruency rela-
tive to orthographic practice. Nouns derived from a verb by prefix addition, show no
vowel elision.àòó ‘thought’                           oo ‘to think’
èkpà ‘vomit’                            kpa ‘to vomit’Compound forms, however, pose potential problems for orthographic practice.
Vowels at word boundaries within compounds are subject to elision. When the verb
in a verb-noun compound is transitive (e.g. ze ‘scrape,’ da ‘drink’), its single vowel
8 | Orthography and grammatical overviewis elided. Comparison of forms for ‘barber’ and ‘drunkard’ reveal how only the
sound shapes of prefix and noun, but not verb, are consistent across broad phonetic
form and orthographic practice.òzètò    [ò-ze-étò]                     òdènyò    [ò-da-ényò]
‘barber’ prefix-scrape-hair             ‘drunkard’ prefix-drink-wineElision also affects nasal vowels in verb-noun compounds but not in the manner
evident in syntactic constructions. Whereas only the vowel of a verb is elided in
syntactic phrases, both the vowel and its nasal quality (e.g. ken ‘divide’ and kpen ‘be
next to’) tend to be effaced in compounds.ákèvà          [á-ken-èvá]              ókpòkhúnmí [ó-kpen-òkhùnmì]
‘twin kernels’ prefix-divide-two        ‘upward’    prefix-be.next.to-topIn compounds, non-nasal vowels elide and are not rendered orthographically. In
noun-noun compounds, orthographic practice and broad phonetic rendering align,
except for the final vowel of the compound’s left constituent.ákòísí' [àkò     òísí']                 ákùhàì [àkò     ùhàì]
‘holster’ sheath gun                    ‘quiver’ sheath arrow    Elision is also evident in word formation involving reduplication. Forms refer-
ring to relationships of time and space involve reduplication of an entire root (e.g.
ésè ‘center of’ and édè ‘day’), with accompanying elision of the initial constituent’s
morpheme-final vowel. Orthographic practice shows the vowel as elided.ésèsé     [ésè-ésè]                     èdèdé    [édè-édè]
‘direct center of’                      ‘moments ago’
ésè                                     édè
‘center of’                             ‘day’    Pronunciation of phrasal compounds also reflects glide formation. The final
close vowels of augmentative údù and diminutive úvbì, when preceding a vowel,
assume a glide shape. Orthographic practice retains the corresponding vowel.údú émà [údwémà]                        úvbì àfàn [úvbyàfàn]
AUG yam                                 DIM harp

1.5 Basic sentence types and pitch register
Basic grammatical relations in Emai show the order Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).
Declarative statements with transitive verbs reveal a subject noun phrase (ólí ómòhè
‘the man’) followed by a verb (é ‘eat’) and its direct object (ólí émàè ‘the food’).(1) ólí ómòhè é         ólí émàè.
    the man PRP.eat the food
    ‘The man has eaten the food.’Sentence types contrast with respect to voice-register and tonal pattern. Imperative
constructions utilize a normal voice register.(2) è ólí émàè.
    eat the food
    ‘Eat the food.’Declaratives rely on a normal voice register as well.(3) ólí ómòhè é         ólí émàè.
    the man PRP.eat the food
    ‘The man has eaten the food.’However, polar interrogatives (yes/no questions), while manifesting the same word
order as declaratives and essentially the same tonal patterns, employ a higher pitch
register.(4) ólí ómòhè é         ólí émàè?
    the man PRP.eat the food
    ‘Has the man eaten the food?’Rhetorical questions are also expressed through this higher register, adding a final
extra-high tone (e.g. é) to a lexical low tone (émàè).(5) ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàèé?
    the man SC C eat the food
    ‘The man is eating the food, is he?’
10 | Orthography and grammatical overview1.6 Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution
Tonal configurations in Emai reveal the interaction of lexical tone with syntactic
tone values derived from grammatical categories and their placement. Traditional
phrase heads such as nouns and verbs exhibit tonal variability controlled by pres-
ence or absence of modifying constituents or of adjacent phrases. For purposes of
illustration, we rely on noun phrases and monotransitive or ditransitive verb
phrases to convey an overview of the nature of this variability, although a full ac-
count of principles underlying sentence, clause and phrase tone remains to be un-
dertaken.","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"

     Temporal coincidence with bíì phrases does not correspond to verbs in series.(i) a. *ó víé'        húá ìwàwà.

    b. *ó húá'         ìwàwà víé.
        she PAP.take pots cry
        ‘She carried pots crying.’18
  Matrix clauses in causal circumstance accept manner-demonstrative preverbs ìyó and ìná. They
are interpreted as coreferential with the subordinate circumstantial clause; they are manner
proforms with subordinate clause as antecedent. Nonetheless, ìyó and ìná do not exhibit parallel
distribution. Each occurs in focus position relative to a matrix clause, thereby immediately follow-
ing its antecedent circumstantial clause, which itself occurs in topic position. Constructions with
manner proforms in focus position require Manner preverb i in the matrix clause.(i) a. ébé' òhí í'          gbé ólí éwè, ìyó lí ó í'                   é óí ògbòn.

           PMD PF you PRED MAN take it APP me
      ‘Since this morsel of yam is very fresh now, it is this way you will give it to me.’In other constructions, ìyó appears in matrix clause preverb position; ìná does not.

         as he PAP.MAN take wood he PAP.PMD enter LOC house
          ‘Since he carried wood, he in this way entered the house.’Manner-demonstrative adverbials do not occur in postverbal position in the matrix clause of a
circumstantial construction.(iii) a. *ébé' ó í'            húá éràn, ó ó'           vbí íwé ìyó.

          ‘Since he carried the wood, he entered the house this way.’19
   Unlike ébé'/ébí', élàbé/élàbí does not participate in temporal coincidence of circumstance con-
structions framed by Punctual aspectualizer ghe.(i) a. ébé' ó ghé'         ì     dá    ólí ényò léé,     òhí vá'rè.
       as he PAP.PCT MAN drink the wine TEMP Ohi PAP.come

        as     he PAP.PCT MAN drink the wine TEMP Ohi PAP.come
        ‘Just as he finished drinking the wine, Ohi came.’20
  Aside from circumstantial extent, se is found in three other constructions (Chapter 6, 6.1.6, Chap-
ter 7, 7.5.2.3, and Chapter 11, 11.3). As a verb with a locative complement, it designates directional
motion.(i) ò sé                     vbì ìwè.
    he PRP.move.as.far.as LOC house
    ‘He moved as far as the house.’As a verb in series and with an optional complement, se specifies that an event is sufficient relative
to cultural norms. (Chapter 11, 11.6.1)(ii) a. ò dá         ényò sé.
        he PRP.drink wine be.sufficient
        ‘He drank enough wine. / He drank wine to a sufficient extent.’

        he PRP.drink wine reach LOC limit
        ‘He drank wine to the limit.’The verb se is also found as an obligatory constituent in questions of extent, where it combines with
ébé'/ébí' and Manner preverb i. Such questions invite responses with quantity preverb zemi.

         ‘How much strength does he have?’   ‘He has a lot of strength.’21
  Matrix clauses in extent constructions accept manner-demonstrative ìyó, not ìná as proforms.
Antecedents for ìyó occur as subordinate circumstantial extent clauses.(i) ébé' í í'           móé étìn        sé,

    ‘Since I have such strength, I also that way used it to show him too.’Maintaining the same discourse function, manner-demonstrative ìyó also appears in focus position
relative to a matrix clause, thereby allowing ìyó to immediately follow the subordinate extent
clause.(ii) ébé' í í'          móé étìn         sé,     ìyó lí í gbó'         ì     ré óì vbíéé óì.
     as I PAP.MAN have strength reach DMD PF I PAP.ADD MAN use it show him
     ‘Since I have such strength, so it is that I also used it to show him too.’22
  Information in matrix clauses linked to extent clauses is queried by questions framed by
ébé'/ébí'...i...se that convey erstwhile subordinate clause information. Responses require normative
extent se, its vbi phrase and its extraposed khi complement expressing the erstwhile matrix clause
proposition.(i) ébé' ó í'            é émàè sé?

  As with S-complement subjunctives (Chapter 13, 13.2.4), purposive li…í clauses show a unique
pattern vis-à-vis modality marking and grammatical subject shape. With pronominal subjects, li
clauses show deontic Hortative i. With lexical subjects, li clauses reveal no overt Hortative.(i) a. ò sá         àmè lí        yán í      kpè dé ényò ní áìn.

       ‘The woman said that they should buy the yam.’Aside from multi-clause structures, li serves three functions in complex predicates. As outlined in

  Responses to émé' ze li re questions allow not only li…í marked purposive clauses but also òhíó

  Exceptive marker sòkpén appears derived from an idiomatic serial verb sequence so ‘to touch’ and
kpen ‘be next to.’ Although not widely used at present, this sequence manifests an exclusionary
sense consistent with sòkpén. In addition, this marker seems more prominent in the neighboring
Ora dialect than in Emai.(i) a. è    só         kpén    óí vbí ékùèè ré.
       they PRP.touch next.to him LOC meeting arrive
       ‘They excluded him from the meeting.’
    b. è    só         kpén    óí vbì ò ré.
       they PRP.touch next.to him LOC it arrive
       ‘They excluded him from it.’28
 A noteable exception, however, is that cross clause subjects in sòkpén constructions where a
whole-part relation (e.g. áléké ~ áwé óì) exists are acceptable.(i) áléké ó ò jàjá               sòkpén khí áwé óì kèré        gbè.
    Aleke SC H be.energetic except IND legs her be. small t oo.much
    ‘Alekei is energetic except that heri legs are too small.’29
  When the òhíó khi clause is in focus position preceding li/ni, a polar question is allowed. When
òhíó khi is in topic position, a polar question is disallowed.(i) a. òhíó khí òhí kéè            gbé ófè ní áìn lí ólí ómó ó ò rè gbé?
        cause IND Ohi PRP.ANT kill rat APP him PF the child SC H take dance
        ‘Was it because Ohi afterward killed a rat for him that the child dances?’
    b. *òhíó khí òhí kéè          gbé ófè ní áìn, ólí ómò ò ó gbé?
        cause IND Ohi PRP.ANT kill rat APP him the child SC C dance
        ‘Was it because Ohi afterward killed a rat for him that the child is dancing?’30
   Clauses headed by èmìdí and òhíó exhibit asymmetric behavior with respect to their constituent
clause verb types. Clauses marked by òhíó and èmìdí fail to exhibit the same causal force across verb
pairs. For paired events denoted by o ‘enter’ and mie ‘see’ or moe ‘have’ and nwu li ‘give,’ only òhíó
is acceptable, not èmìdí. The principle behind this constraint is not clear at this time.(i) a. ó ó'             vbì ìwè òhíó khì ò míé            òhí.
        he PAP.enter LOC house cause IND he PRP.see Ohi

  Phrases headed by èrímí never appear in canonical declaratives as direct objects of re ‘take’ in
series.(i) *òhí ré'       èrímí ísì ólì òkpòsò váré'.
     Ohi PAP.take behalf ASS the woman come
     ‘Ohi came on behalf of the woman.’32
  It is not only èrímí phrases that restrict information questions. èrímí’s complement also fails to
take an interrogative pronoun.(i) a. èrímí' mè lí ójé ré'           yé       òkè.
        behalf me PF Oje PAP.take move.to Oke
        ‘It was on my behalf that Oje went to Oke.’
    b. *èrímí' óé' lí ójé ré'           yé      òkè?
        behalf who PF Oje PAP.take move.to Oke
        ‘On whose behalf did Oje go to Oke?’33
  Benefactive èrímí and causal òhíó associatives exhibit contrasting interpretations of their associ-
ated possessor location. With òkpòsò ‘woman’ as possessor, òhíó assumes the woman to be in the
target location, therefore implying (ib), while èrímí phrases make the opposite assumption, imply-
ing (id).(i) a. òhíó ísì òkpòsò lí ójé ré'            yé       áfúzé'.
       cause ASS woman PF Oje PAP.take move.to Afuze
       ‘It was for the sake of a woman that Ohi went to Afuze.’
    b. ólì òkpòsò ríì        vbí áfúzé'.
       the woman PRP.be LOC Afuze
       ‘The woman is in Afuze.’
    c. èrímí ísì ólì òkpòsò lí ójé ré'            yé        áfúzé'.
       behalf ASS the woman PF Oje PAP.take move.to Afuze
       ‘It was for the woman's sake that Oje went to Afuze.’
    d. ólì òkpòsò í ì        è vbí áfúzé'.
       the woman SC NEG be LOC Afuze
       ‘The woman is not in Afuze.’34
  Despite these ellipted structures, da never precedes both affirmative and negative clause in multi-
clause constructions. Nor does da ever occur at the end of a clause.(i) a. *dà ò dé'         ólí úkpùn dà ó ì        dè ólí úkpùn?
        or he PAP.buy the cloth or he NEG buy the cloth
        ‘Or did he buy the cloth or did he not buy the cloth?’

with good fortune that is positioned as a deity staff.
     Here it is. It is I who am called Monday. Do you not see these people who live in
this very place? It is as eye witnesses that all live in this very place.
     There were two women who were in the village. They were called Aaegbe and
Ionlesen. These two women, they were more beautiful than anything that had ever
yet been experienced. This one who was called Aaegbe, she was beauty beyond
measure. Witness this thing. These are women? Where among womankind did these
ones come from? So Aaegbe prepared her things. She told Ionlesen, there is no other
job that one will do other than prostitution. That one said it. It isn’t so, is it?
     This Aaegbe who must have had this conversation, a wound made havoc on her
leg. It is with a rag that she wraps it. But it was this Aaegbe alone that men liked
more, it is they who searched up and down for her. She said, “Look at it, Ionlesen,
since it was discovered that it is I that men are fond of, one surely hasn’t found how
one will deal with it. But the wound which is on this leg of mine, this leg will be
exchanged for another one.” Ionlesen said, “It isn’t so is it? The money that will be
made afterward, it will be mixed together.” Aegbe said, “It will be mixed together. It
will be saved and used to eat food.” Ionlesen said, “It is fine.”
     Just as they were having this conversation, three young men came. At once,
they knocked on the door, ratatattat. Yes, Aaegbe said, “I say that I have come.
What are you searching for?” They said, “Aaegbe. I say that we will take you to La-
gos.” Aaegbe said, “Lagos? Ionlesen, I say come, this wound, it does not know how
to become large. When I remove the cloth from it, I say that men will disperse and
run away.” Ionlesen said, “There isn’t anything else to do. I will just hold it for you.”
980 | Sample oral narrativeIonlesen then said, “Aaegbe, I say bring your leg.” So they exchanged legs with
each other. Each leg locked into place. Aaegbe then said, “It isn’t so, is it?” Aaegbe
then said, I want to bathe. So she bathed don’t you know. Ionlesen picked out her
things. She then said, “I am coming, in order to enter the room.” After she glanced
about, she did not see Aaegbe. So she started to sing a song.
    SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a
favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
    Don’t you see it? One does not lead another one on to some place, as might be
thought. I wonder whether you are seeing it. As a result, Ionlesen picked out her
things. She approached the door. She then said, “A group of young men of this
kind.’ She then said, “I ask you for the person I am searching for.” One said, “Who
are you surely searching for?” Ionlesen said, “Who do you surely search for?” Ion-
lesen then said, “Aaegbe.” One said, “It is beauty that has overtaken her.” Another
said, “Yes, Aaegbe, she picked out her things just recently, she proceeded to Afuze,
don’t you know.” Ionlesen also put her legs to walking.
    SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a

Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not

    “A plight,” Ionlesen then said, “A plight is this one. Aaegbe.” Ionlesen started
walking. She reached Afuze. One said, “Just recently Aaegbe came out from this
room. When you see her, she and the men, she took the men to her. When they posi-
tion each other noisily, they crash onto the ground from the bed. They make noises
with their bodies. They crash on the ground from the bed. They make noises with
their bodies. They thump on the mat.” One said, “How will one deal with this one?”
One said, “Aaegbe, I say that she just came out recently. She proceeded to Otuo.”
Ionlesen said yes, it is walking that I have started. I intend to do goodness, I do it
but what do I get in return? So she started to sing a song.
    SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,

Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not

    Don’t you see it? So Ionlesen reached Otou. After she reached Otuo, she encoun-
tered young men assessing each other. Some were jumping away at the window. She
then said, “I ask you please, rescue me.” One asked her, “What happened to you?”
She said, “It is Aaegbe I search for.” One said, “Aaegbe? She just picked up her

should happen to move to is the place where I start out from. So Ionlesen then
picked out her things.
      SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,

Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not

      It is just so, isn’t it? So Ionlesen started on her journey, briskly moving on. So
she reached Benin City, don’t you know. After she reached Benin City, she encoun-
tered that the entirety of the young men, they were seething a great deal. Sweat was
overcoming everyone completely on their shoulder blade. Ionlesen said, “How?”
Ionlesen said, “I say that it is Aaegbe I am searching for.” One said he took one
woman who was beautiful in that way just recently. Another said, “Yes, she picked
out her things. She said she was going to Lagos.” Ionlesen then said, “Is it I who am
this one? The wound will infest me today. I will be infested by this wound today.
The wound, it is, Aaegbe then told me, take, hold it for me. I held the wound for her.
It is an act of goodness that I performed.” So Ionlesen walked to Lagos.
      SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,

favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
      That is how it is. There passed one market week, one fortnight, walking is what
Ionlesen did. It is she. Her toes were about to wither away on the road to Lagos. “I
will just ensure that I will see her today.” Ionlesen, she shuffled into Lagos. The
people said, “Greetings.” Another said, “Greetings.” This one said, “Greetings.” She
then said, “This thing you speak, this is not the language I know. I say that it is a
person I search for. There is no one who will give me a helping hand?” One said,
“Whom do you search for?” She said, “One small girl that is called Aaegbe.” One
said, “Go into that room, you will meet her in there.” So Ionlesen entered the room
don’t you know. It was men she met. She said, “I ask you about the woman you
carried into this room.” One said, “Yes, it is Aaegbe who proceeded to Ajegunle and
entered inside Lagos. What? Ajegunle inside Lagos.” “Is it Ajegunle that she now
entered?” He then said, “It is just so.”
      SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a
favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
982 | Sample oral narrative     It is that way that one experienced it don’t you know. So Ionlesen reached
Ajegunle. After she was coming, she encountered young men. What does one now
call this kind of person? “I ask you to allow me to pass, for it is a person I am search-
ing for.” One said, “I say that Aaegbe is just in the room.” After Ionlesen came to the
room, she found that Aaegbe had plaited the hair with an enticing hair style (one-
looks-at-me-does-not-look-elsewhere). Ionlesen then said, “Aaegbe, I am coming so
that your wound should infest you, so that this wound should infest you. You asked
me to hold your wound for you. The wound, you gave it to me. You shuffled into
Lagos. It is I who now experienced suffering.” Aaegbe who is infested with a wound,
she is beautiful throughout. Aaegbe, take the wound. Ionlesen said, “It was surely
not discovered how one will deal with it. Since it happened this way, bring your
shin in order that we should exchange them, in order for you to take hold of your
wound.” Aaegbe pulled her buttocks near her back. I say that it is so, isn’t it? Ion-
lesen said, “I intend to also now reach womanhood of my own and exhibit beauty
like you. For, indeed, we should reach womanhood together.” So Aaegbe brought
her shin. So Ionlesen brought her shin. So they each fit their own shin into place.
This is the reason that when a person bruises a leg at the shin, the wound it makes
on the shin is messy. The story just finishes that way.

"7.6.2 Negation kiSentence negation (SN) constructions are framed by clause initial ki. They negate an
entire proposition, specifying that it is not shared by speaker and hearer as true. The
construction takes the form of a polar interrogative or a declarative with an obliga-
tory contrary-to-expectation interjection ò. Consequently, ki either queries the prop-
osition expressed in the interrogative with an assumption of doubt or contravenes
the interjection framed declarative structure.(146) a. kí ólí ókpósó één'-ì?
         SN the woman PAP.know-F
         ‘Isn't it the case that the woman knew?’
      b. kí ólí ókpósó één'-ì             ò.
         SN the woman PAP.know-F INT
         ‘Don't think the woman knew, she probably didn't.’
         ‘It surely isn't the case that the woman knew.’
      c. kí ólí ómóhé méhén'-ì?
         SN the man PAP.sleep-F
         ‘Isn't it the case that the man slept?’
      d. kí ólí ómóhé méhén'-ì            ò.
         SN the man PAP.sleep-F INT
         ‘It isn't the case the man slept, even though you expect he did.’A response to interrogative ki constructions is hèè ‘yes’ followed by an affirmative
declarative, or òghò ‘no’ followed by a negative statement.(147) kí ólí ómóhé gbé'           ófè?
      SN the man PAP.kill rat
      ‘Isn't it the case that the man killed a rat?’
                                                                   Sentence focus | 409      hèè, ó gbé'          óì.        /        òghò, ó ì       gbè óì.
      yes he PAP.kill it                       no    he NEG kill it
      ‘Yes, he killed it.’                     ‘No, he did not kill it.’    ki constructions constrain their matrix clause subject, inflection and occurrence
of auxiliaries and preverbs. Regarding preverbs, SN imposes severe restrictions. It
rejects all preverbs: aspectualizer, evaluative, temporal, subject attributive, quantity
and manner-demonstrative. SN ki constructions partially limit aspect. They inflect
for Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predictive prospective. Thus they disallow
Present perfect, Continuous imperfect and Anticipative prospective.(148) a. kí ólí óvbékhán fí'           ólí ókpósó úkpóràn?
         SN the youth          PAP.hit the woman stick

         SN the man         PRED sleep INT
         ‘It surely isn't the case that the man will sleep.’     In ki matrix clauses modality auxiliaries are restricted absolutely. One finds nei-
ther deontic (Hortative í) nor epistemic (Certaintive ma, Dubitative vba and bia,
Deductive za, Resultative za, Concessive rere, Hypothetical kha). Hypothetical kha
illustrates (*kí ólí ómóhé khà gbé ófè? [SN the man PAP.HYP kill rat] ‘Isn’t it the case
that the man would have killed a rat?’).
     SN ki clauses completely reject relative tense ke and kpe, as ke shows (*kí ólí
ómóhé ké' gbé ófè? [SN the man PAP.ANT kill rat] ‘Isn’t it the case that the man
killed a rat afterwards?’).
     SN ki clauses constrain subject shape. They allow proper nouns (òlóló) and def-
inite common nouns: human (ómóhé), animate (ófé) and inanimate (íkpún).32(149) a. kí òlóló gbé'         ólí ófè.

         SN the rat        rat PAP.eat the yam INT

410 | Noncanonical constructions     d. kí élí íkpún / *íkpún tóó'              á ò.
        SN the cloths         cloths PAP.burn CS INT
        ‘It surely isn't the case that the cloth pieces burned up.’     ki construction subject phrases restrict some postdeterminers. SN animate sub-
jects modified by the definite article combine with deictic demonstratives ná and áín
(kí ólí ómóhé ná / áín gbé' ófè ò [SN the man this that PAP.kill rat INT] ‘It surely isn't
the case that this / that man killed a rat’). Also acceptable is contrastive demonstra-
tive nóí (kí ómóhé nóí gbé' ófè ò [SN man next PAP.kill rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the
case that the next man killed a rat’).
     In SN subject position kindred forms are partially restricted. Deictic élìyó is
grammatical but contrastive sortal ódàn is not (kí úkpún élìyó / *ódàn ó ò ghàén ò
[SN cloth that.kind different.kind SC H costly INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that that
kind of cloth is costly’).
     SN subjects admit only one quantifier, collective universal èrèmé. It occurs, alt-
hough not with the definite article (kí (*élí) éwé èrèmé ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goats all
PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that all the goats entered the
house’). No other quantifier (distributive universal òdóòdé, partitive existential ósò
or contrastive existential óvbèé) occupies SN subject position as modifier.
     Subject phrases in ki matrix clauses allow most numeral modifiers. One finds
collective ìgbìgbé ‘all ten’ (kí íkpún ìgbìgbé tóó' á vbí ólì èràìn ò? [SN cloths all.ten
PAP.burn CS LOC the fire INT] ‘Isn't it surely the case that all ten cloths burned up in
the fire?’) and cardinal èvá ‘two,’ although cardinals require the definite article (kí
élí éfè èvá ó' vbì òò ò? [SN the rat two PAP.enter LOC hole INT] ‘Isn't it surely the case
that two rats entered the hole?’). SN subjects disallow cardinal òkpá ‘one,’ regard-
less of constituent definiteness (*kí ómòhè òkpá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN man one PAP.enter
LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that one man entered the house’), and em-
phatic òkpá ‘alone’ (*kí ólí ómòhè òkpá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the man alone PAP.enter LOC
house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the man alone entered the house’).
     ki subjects accept postnominal modifier phrases. Among the latter are expres-
sions with Associative ísì (kí (ólí) éwé ísì ólí ókpósó ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goat ASS the
woman PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the woman's goat
entered the house’), Relator li (kí (ólí) éwé lí óbín' ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goat R dark
PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the dark goat entered the
house’) and relative clause (kí (ólí) ómóhé lí ó dá' ólí ényó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the man
R he PAP.drink the wine PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It isn't the case that the man who
drank the wine killed the rat, although you may have thought so’). In elicited con-
structions, there is a preference for definite article inclusion.
     Subject position in ki constructions imposes greater restrictions on impersonal
pronouns than personal pronouns. It allows subject pronouns for each person and
number.
                                                                     Sentence focus | 411(150) kí í / ú / ó gbé'                ólí ófè ò.
      SN I you he PAP.kill the rat INT
      ‘It surely isn't the case that I / you / he killed the rat.’As expected, SN subjects never admit emphatic pronouns (*kí mèmè / ìyóín gbé' ólí
ófè ò [SN I he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that I / he killed the rat’).
     SN subjects allow some impersonal pronouns. Among these are contrastive
demonstrative ónóí (kí ónóí ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN next.one PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It
surely isn't the case that the next one entered the house’) and deictic demonstrative
óáín and óná (kí óáín / óná ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN that.one this.one PAP.enter LOC house
INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that that one / this one entered the house’). Again, em-
phatic proximal ónánà is preferred (kí ónáná ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN this.very.one PAP.enter
LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that this very one entered the house’).
     As SN subject, kindred forms are constrained absolutely. Neither deictic élìyó
nor contrastive ódàn are acceptable (*kí élìyó / ódán ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN that.kind differ-
ent.kind PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that that kind / different
kind of one entered the house’).
     ki construction subjects restrict most quantifier pronouns. They do allow collec-
tive universal èrèmé (kí èrèmé ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN all PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely
isn't the case that all entered the house’). But remaining quantifiers, distributive
universal òdóòdé, partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé, are unacceptable.
     ki subjects limit most numeral pronouns.33 Neither cardinals (e.g. èvá) nor col-
lectives (e.g. èvèvá) occur (*kí èvá / èvèvá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN two all.two PAP.enter LOC
house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that two of them entered the house’). úkpòkpá
‘one,’ although only as partitive phrase head, appears as SN subject (kí úkpòkpá vbí
ó húnmé'-ì ò [SN one LOC it PAP.be.good-F INT] ‘It isn't the case that one from them
is good, although you may have thought so’). But cardinal òkpá ‘one’ fails (*kí òkpá
húnmé'-ì ò [SN one PAP.be.good-F INT] ‘It isn't the case that one is good’).
     In SN subject position one also finds more complex pronoun constituents.
Among these are pronominal attributives (kí ólí óbín' gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the dark.one
PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the dark one killed the rat’) and
pronominally headed relatives without Recurrent preverb a (kí ólí ó *á dé' ólí úkpún
gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN one he RC PAP.buy the cloth PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the
case that the one who bought the cloth killed the rat’).
     SN constructions greatly limit expression of polarity and mood. They appear as
polar interrogatives (kí ólí ómóhé shén' ólì émà? [SN the man PAP.sell the yam] ‘Isn't
it the case that the man sold the yam?’). However, they never occur as negative
statements, imperatives or prohibitives, as unacceptable negatives suggest (kí ólí
ómóhé í ì shèn ólì émà? [SN the man SC NEG sell the yam] ‘Isn't it the case that the
man did not sell the yam?’).
412 | Noncanonical constructions    Additional precedence constraints affect SN kí in complex sentences. SN never
precedes subjects under indicative khi, conditional si or subjunctive li.(151) a. *òjè één-í          khí kí ólí ómóhé é'               émà ò.

es.34 ki does not precede subjects in subordinate adverbial clauses, for example tem-

7.7 Noncanonical construction co-occurrence
Constructions reflecting sentence affirmation, sentence negation, positive focus,
negative focus, topic, right dislocation and information question types are con-
strained in their ability to co-occur. For constructions that relate a discourse defined
position to a corresponding grammatical relation, compatibility is possible only
with distinct grammatical relations. No two constructions are compatible when
affecting the same grammatical relation.
     Sentence affirmation and sentence negation establish a baseline for assessing
construction compatibility. Of the two, sentence negation is more restricted. SA érí'
and SN ki are compatible, although érí' must precede ki (*kí érí' ólí ómóhé gbé' ófè
[SN SA the man PAP.kill rat] ‘It is not the case, indeed, that the man killed a rat’).(154) érí' kí ólí ómóhé gbé'           ófè.
      SA SN the man PAP.kill rat
      ‘Indeed, it is not the case that the man killed a rat.’Sentence affirmation is restricted with other constructions. It appears with topicali-
zation and RD but never with positive focus, negative focus or direct questions. As
shown below, SA and topicalization are compatible, provided the matrix clause
shows relative tense Anterior ke (*ólí ómòhè, érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man SA he
PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the man, indeed he killed the rat’). Also below, SA érí' fol-
lows a topic noun phrase (*érí' ólí ómòhè, ó ké' gbé ólí ófè [SA the man he PAP.ANT
kill the rat] ‘Indeed, as for the man, he killed the rat afterward’).(155) a. ólí ómòhè, érí' ó ké'           gbé ólí ófè.
         the man       SA he PAP.ANT kill the rat
         ‘As for the man, indeed he killed the rat afterward.’
      b. òjè, érí' á à ké nwù óí gbúdú.
         Oje SA one H ANT take him squirming.fashion
         ‘As for Oje, indeed he was afterward taken squirming.’Sentence affirmation and right dislocation are compatible. érí' precedes a matrix
clause whose subject or direct object relation corresponds to the RD constituent.(156) a. érí' ó gbé'      ófè, í khì ólí ómòhè.
         SA he PAP.kill rat ID be the man
         ‘Indeed he killed a rat, that is the man.’
      b. érí' ólí ómóhé gbé'         óì, í khì ólí ófè.
         SA the man PAP.kill it ID be the rat
         ‘Indeed the man killed it, that is the rat.’
414 | Noncanonical constructionsWhen matrix verb takes both direct and indirect object, sentence affirmation and
right dislocation combine only when the direct object is right dislocated. érí' is un-
acceptable when subject or indirect object corresponds to the RD constituent.(157) a. érí' ójé shén'     óì ní    ólì òkpòsò, í khì ólí úkpùn.
         SA Oje PAP.sell it APP the woman ID be the cloth
         ‘Indeed Oje sold it to the woman, that is the cloth.’
      b. *érí ó shén'       ólí úkpùn ní ólì òkpòsò, í khì òjè.
          SA he PAP.sell the cloth APP the woman ID be Oje
          ‘Indeed, he sold the cloth to the woman, that is Oje.’
      c. *érí' ójé shén'     ólí úkpùn ní áìn, í khì ólì òkpòsò.
          SA Oje PAP.sell the cloth APP her ID be the woman
          ‘Indeed Oje sold the cloth to her, that is the woman.’      Sentence affirmation does not precede or follow positive focus li/ni (*érí' ólí ófè
lí ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [SA the rat PF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘Indeed, it was the rat that the
man killed’, *ólí ómóhé lí érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man PF SA he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was
the man, indeed, who killed the rat’), negative focus ki (*érí' ólí ómóhé kí ó gbé' ólí
ófè [SA the man NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘Indeed, it wasn’t the rat that the man killed’,
*ólí ófè kí érí' ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [the rat NF SA the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It wasn’t the rat
that indeed the man killed’) or information question frames (*óé' érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè?
[who SA he PAP.kill the rat] ‘Who indeed killed the rat?’, *érí' émé' ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì?
[SA what the man PAP.kill-F] ‘Indeed, what did the man kill?’).
      Sentence negation co-occurs with only two construction types, although in nei-
ther does SN ki occur clause initially. As indicated previously, sentence negation co-
occurs with sentence affirmation provided ki follows érí'. In addition, SN combines
with topicalization. It never combines with positive focus, negative focus, right
dislocation or information questions.
      Sentence negation co-occurs with topicalization as shown immediately below,
provided the topic phrase precedes ki (*kì ólí ómòhè, ó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the man he
PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case that as for the man, he killed the rat).(158) ólí ómòhè, kí ó gbé'            ólí ófè ò.

Alternative forms articulate direct and indirect questions of Person. An interrogative
pronoun with the number shapes singular óe'/ói' and plural éé'/éí' frame Person
direct questions. When the question word corresponds to matrix subject, a pronoun
appropriately shaped for case and number (singular o, plural e) occurs in matrix
subject position. For indirect object position marked by Applicative li/ni, a zero
pronoun corresponds to the interrogative pronoun for person.(80) a. óé' ó híán'      ólí óràn?
        who he PAP.cut the wood
        ‘Who cut the wood?’
                                                        Information questions | 385    b. éé' é     híán'    ólí óràn?

    d. éé'   ólí ómóhé ré'        émà ní?
       whom the man PAP.take yam APP
       ‘Whom did the man give yam to?’Indirect questions of Person rely on the relative pronoun ólì/élì with its singu-
lar/plural forms. Question position in indirect interrogatives never accepts pronoun
óé'/óí' ~ éé' /éí'. When the question word corresponds to matrix subject, a pronoun
appropriately shaped for case and number (singular ó, plural é) occupies subject
position. When the question word corresponds to indirect object marked by Applica-
tive li/ni, the matrix clause exhibits a zero pronoun.(81) a. ì één         ólí / *óé' ó híán'     ólí óràn.

structions. Disfavored are relevant noun phrases in situ.(82) óé' ó híán'       ólí óràn?

Direct and indirect questions of Possessor are framed by Person interrogative pro-
nouns and relative pronouns. However, question shape varies according to direct or
indirect status. Direct questions utilize interrogative pronoun óé'/óí'~éé'/éí' as com-
plement of an Associative ísì phrase, the entire phrase being in question position.(83) a. éwé ísì óé' ólí ómóhé nwú'           lí  ònwìmè?
        goat ASS who the man PAP.take APP farmer
        ‘Whose goat did the man give to the farmer?’
     b. éwé ísì éé' ólí ómóhé nwú'            lí  ònwìmè?
        goat ASS who the man PAP.take APP farmer
        ‘Whose goat did the man give to the farmer?’Indirect questions of Possessor assume either of two shapes. When the question
position constituent corresponds to a matrix relation other than subject, the relative
pronoun ólì appears in question position and a personal pronoun (òí) occupies the
corresponding matrix clause position.17(84) a. ì één         ólí ójé nwú'        éwé ísì òí lí      ònwìmè.
          I PRP.know one Oje PAP.take goat ASS his APP farmer
          ‘I knew whose goat Oje gave to the farmer.’
     b. *ì één        éwé ísì óé' ójé nwú'            lí  ònwìmè.

          I PRP.know goat ASS one Oje PAP.take APP farmer
          ‘I knew whose goat Oje gave to the farmer.’When the question constituent in an indirect question with Possessor corefers to
matrix clause subject, an entire Associative ísì phrase (éwé ísì ólí) occurs in embed-
ded clause initial position. The relative pronoun ólí serves as Possessor. Subject in
the matrix clause then requires a personal pronoun (e.g. ó).(85) a. ì één       éwé ísì ólí ó ó'           vbì ìwè.
        I PRP.know goat ASS one it PAP.enter LOC house

        I PRP.know one goat ASS his PAP.enter LOC house

in focus position, headless associative phrases in Specifier copula óò constructions,
headless associative phrases or Possessor noun phrases. Unacceptable are simple
noun phrases in Specifier copula constructions, or full associative phrases in situ.(86) éwé ísì óé' ólí ómòhè nwú'              lí    ònwìmè?

Direct and indirect questions of Time show éghè ‘time’ in question position and verb
re ‘take’ in series in the matrix clause. Direct questions show an optional positive
focus particle after éghè.(87) a. éghè ólí ómóhé ré'        híán ólí óràn?
        time the man PAP.take cut the wood
        ‘When did the man cut the wood?’

        time PF the man PAP.take cut the wood
        ‘When did the man cut the wood?’Indirect questions of Time show éghè followed by obligatory Relator particle li. This
particle demarcates a relative clause and induces high tone spread on éghè.18(88) ì één       éghé lí ólí ómóhé ré'   híán ólí óràn.

      ‘He cut it yesterday.’             ‘It was yesterday.’7.5.2.7 Object émé' / émí'
The interrogative pronoun émé'/émí' frames direct and indirect Object questions.
Direct questions show émé'/émí' in question position. Indirect questions also show
émé'/émí' in clause initial position under the verb een, as head of an unmarked
relative clause.19(90) a. émé' ólí ómóhé ré'        híán ólí óràn?

        I PRP.know what it PAP.cause-F SUBJ he PAP.CONC cut wood
        ‘I knew why he should cut wood.’Direct questions of Cause reveal responses correlating with embedded complement
type. When the question employs indicative khi, responses show a clause headed by
òhíó ‘cause’ with a following khi clause. Disfavored are S-complements without òhíó
and khi. Also unacceptable are responses with èrìmí or èmìdí, whose meanings
closely relate to òhíó.(93) émé' ó zé-í'         khí ólí ómòhè vbí     ìyó?

taining an embedded clause with Resultative preverb za. Unacceptable are prospec-
tive aspect clauses lacking an S-complement or responses shaped by èrìmí or èmìdí.

The question word ékà ‘quantity’ articulates direct and indirect questions of Quanti-
ty. Direct questions illustrate the position and function of ékà. When ékà corre-
sponds to matrix subject, a subject pronoun is obligatory.(101) ékà      ó rì      vbí ááìn?

Quantity questions with partitive sense take either of two patterns with ékà and a
noun.22 Either ékà appears after a bare count noun in question position or ékà ap-
pears in question position and, in the matrix clause, a count noun modified by defi-
nite article élí remains in a vbi marked partitive phrase.23(104) a. érán ékà       ólí ómóhé bén-nó'-ì?

         quantity the man PAP.able cut-DS LOC the trees
         ‘How many of the trees was the man able to cut?’Direct questions of Partitive Quantity are structured differently from indirect ques-

after ékà.(105) a. émá ékà      ójé húá'      lí   ònwìmè?

position with the noun, now modified, in a partitive vbi complement.(106) a. ì één       érán éká       lí ójé bén-nó'-ì.

394 | Noncanonical constructionsAs responses, direct questions of Partitive Quantity take a range of quantity expres-
sions. With ékà and a bare noun in question position, direct questions accept quan-
tity pronouns, including cardinal numerals (e.g. èvá), the collective numerals (e.g.
èvèvá), collective universal quantifier èrèmé, and partitive existential quantifier ésò.

The interrogative form ékà frames lexical and phrasal questions of Cost. Lexical cost
questions relate to subject and direct object positions. ékà Cost questions occur
when the matrix clause shows a verb whose direct object is subcategorized for cost,
e.g. hae ‘pay.’ Direct questions of Cost with these verbs show ékà in question posi-
tion, while indirect questions show ékà as head of a li/ni marked relative clause.(115) a. ékà      ólí ómóhé háé'-ì?
         quantity the man PAP.pay-F
         ‘How much did the man pay?’
      b. ì één        éká    lí ólí ómóhé háé'-ì.
         I PRP.know quantity R the man PAP.pay-F
         ‘I knew how much the man paid.’As well, ékà questions occur when Cost corresponds to subject. Direct questions of
Cost appear in Equational Identity í khi constructions, where ékà in question posi-
tion corresponds to Identity subject pronoun í. There is no corresponding indirect
question of Cost formed with Equational Identity.

      ‘How much is this one?’           ‘I knew how much this one was.’Questions of Cost can be formed with ékà as complement of Associative ísì and its
preceding head noun. Direct questions of Cost show an entire ísì phrase in question
position. It is ísì that differentiates questions of Quantity from questions of Cost.24(117) a. órán ísì ékà          ólí ómóhé híán'-ì?

         log quantity the man PAP.cut-F
         ‘How many logs did the man cut?’Indirect questions of Cost require a relative clause shape. In addition to an ísì phrase
with ékà as complement, they show relative clause Relator li/ni following the ísì
phrase.(118) ì één        órán ísì éká          lí ólí ómóhé híán'-ì.

acceptable responses include: nominals modified by cardinal numerals in focus

     she PAP.CONC say IND the youth        PRP.shoot LOG
     ‘Shei said that the youth shot heri.’In subject position, logophoric pronouns for third person singular (e.g. yon) contrast
with corresponding personal pronouns for third person singular (e.g o). In embed-
ded clauses, personal pronouns impose a disjoint, switch reference condition rela-
tive to their antecedent. Logophoric pronouns require conjoint reference, i.e. refer-
ential identity.(26) a. ólí ómóhé ré'            é khì ò gbé     ólí ófè.

        the man PAP.CONC say IND LOG PRP.kill the rat

tive (khi), subjunctive (li) and conditional (si) complements as well as embedded VP-

     the man PRP.REFL him cut SELF him
     ‘The man himself cut himself.’    The simple Reflexive égbè requires an immediately following accusative pro-
noun (égbé mè / é / óì [SELF my your him/her] ‘myself / yourself / herself’). As ante-
cedent for an égbè Reflexive, a lexically or pronominally headed noun phrase is
acceptable.(33) ólí ómòhè / ò sá             égbé óì.
     the man       he PRP.shoot SELF him
     ‘The man / He shot himself.’Reflexive égbè occupies direct object position and external possessor position,
where its personal pronoun (singular óì or plural íyàìn) must agree in person and
number with its antecedent.3(34) a. ólí ómòhè sá          égbé óì.
        the man PRP.shoot SELF him
        ‘The man shot himself.’
     b. élí ívbèkhàn sá          égbé íyàìn.

      SELF him Oje SC NEG HYP kill the goat
      ‘As for himself, Oje would not have killed the goat.’     The Emphatic Reflexive, whose antecedent is a subject noun phrase, consists of
preverb dobó immediately followed by an accusative pronoun (dobó mè / é / óì
[SELF me you her him] ‘myself, yourself, herself, himself’). In contrast to égbè Re-
flexives, dobó Emphatic Reflexives are limited to positions preceding the verb. They
need not immediately precede the verb or immediately follow the subject, as shown
by a dobó phrase following Predictive aspect ló.

     the man PRED REFL him cut the wood
     ‘The man will by himself cut the wood.’Emphatic Reflexive dobó, in particular its following pronoun, must agree with the
grammatical subject in number and person.(37) a. ólí ómòhè dóbó        óì híán ólí óràn.
        the man PRP.REFL him cut the wood
        ‘The man by himself cut the wood.’
     b. élí ímòhè dóbó       íyàìn híán ólí óràn.
        the men PRP.REFL them cut the wood
        ‘The men by themselves cut the wood.’As its antecedent, emphatic reflexive dobó takes a lexically or pronominally headed
noun phrase.(38) ólí ómòhè / ò dóbó          óì sá     ólí ínì.
     the man     he PRP.REFL him shoot the elephant
     ‘The man / He himself shot the elephant.’    In focus constructions, dobó has the potential to appear in either of two posi-
tions. It can occur between the subject and verb in the matrix clause, where other
preverbs occur.(39) ólí ómòhè lí ó dóbó'        óì zé        ólì ìwè.
     the man PF he PAP.REFL him build the house
     ‘It was the man who by himself built the house.’In addition, dobó phrases can appear in focus position preceding focus particle li/ni,
thereby casting still greater contrastive emphasis on the antecedent referent.4(40) ólí ómòhè dòbó óì lí ó zé'               ólì ìwè.

Locative pronouns refer to a place in situational or linguistic context. They fall into
classes based on distributional patterns.5 One class is sensitive to deictic features.
The other class manifests nondeictic, anaphoric properties.
254 | Pronouns and conjunction    The locative pronoun o has a nondeictic, anaphoric function. It is limited to
noun phrase positions subcategorized for place by the locative preposition vbi. Its
antecedent can occur in a preceding sentence or within the same sentence, e.g. in
discourse focus or topic position.6(41) a. ólí ómòhè zé             ólì àsè. ò ó            vbì ò.
        the man PRP.build the hut he PRP.enter LOC it
        ‘The man built the huti. He entered iti.’
     b. ójé lí ó zé'           ólì àsè òkpá lí ó méhén-í'       vbì ò.
        Oje R he PAP.build the hut alone PF he PAP.sleep-F LOC it
        ‘It was Oje alone who built the huti who slept in iti.’
     c. ólí ékóá nà, òjè ó              vbì ò.
        the room this Oje PRP.enter LOC it
        ‘As for this roomi, Oje entered iti.’     Deictic locative pronouns utilize two principal anchor points for reference. On
one dimension, they distinguish reference point distance relative to the immediate
deictic center (where speaker and hearer are located) at three degrees: ‘right here,’
‘right there’, ‘there-yonder.’ On another dimension, they distinguish reference point
distance relative to a nonimmediate center (with speaker and hearer dislocated from
each other) at two degrees: ‘over here’ and ‘over there.’7ààn ‘right here’ (point)                èàn ‘here, over here’ (area)
ááìn ‘right there’ (point)              éáìn ‘there, over there’ (area)
èvbò ‘there yonder’Deictic locative pronouns occur in noun phrase positions subcategorized for place
by the preposition vbi or by a directional verb such as ye.8 They refer to locative
referents in the situational context.(42) a. ólí òkpòsò ó         vbì èvbò.
        the woman PRP.enter LOC there.yonder
        ‘The woman entered there.’
     b. ólí ókpósó yé'          èvbò.
        the woman PAP.move.to there.yonder
        ‘The women move to / went there.’Relative to a preceding linguistic context, deictic locatives do not exhibit anaphoric
relations.
                                                             Locative pronouns | 255(43) ólí ómòhè zé           ólì àsè.   *ò ó           vbì èvbò.
     the man PRP.build the hut          he PRP.enter LOC there.yonder
     ‘The man built the hut.’           ‘He entered there.’     Deictic locative pronouns reveal much of their semantic character relative to co-
occurring subjects in constructions with locative verb ri/e and preposition vbi
(Chapter 8, 8.1.5). As object of vbi, deictic pronoun exponents correlate differentially
with ri/e subject features such as person (first/third), number (singular/plural),
definiteness (ólì/élì ~ Ø) and noun type (animate, inanimate, nonfixed/fixed loca-
tion). Relative to conditions specified by combinations of these features, the proxi-
mal (ààn, èàn), distal (ááìn, éáìn) and maximal (èvbò) locative pronouns fall into
five subgroups:I ààn, èàn, ááìn, éáìn, èvbò
II ààn, èàn, ááìn, èvbò
III ààn, ááìn, èvbò
IV ààn, èàn
V èvbòOther subgroupings of deictic locatives never appear (*ààn, èàn, ááìn, éáìn; *èàn,
éáìn, èvbò; *ààn, éáìn; *èàn, ááìn). Overall, the distal area form éáìn reveals the most
restricted distribution.
     Group I (ààn, èàn, ááìn, éáìn, èvbò) encompasses all deictic locatives. Members
co-occur with plural count and mass noun subjects. With inflectionally plural inan-
imate count nouns referring to an aggregate as subject, each deictic locative pro-
noun is acceptable as vbi complement.(44) ídò / ígbàn    ríì     vbí ààn / èàn      / ááìn / éáìn / èvbò.
     stones/thorns PRP.be LOC here over.here there over.there yonder
     ‘Stones/thorns are here / over here / there / over there / there yonder.’Mass noun subjects show similar behavior, accepting the full range of deictic loca-
tive pronouns.(45) ìéèsì ríì       vbí ààn / èàn        / ááìn / éáìn         / èvbò.
     rice PRP.be LOC here over.here there over.there yonder
     ‘Rice is here / over here / there / over there / there yonder.’Count nouns such as ògó, which do not show an inflectional plural but refer to an
aggregate, co-occur with Group I locative pronouns.

     bottles PRP.be LOC here over.here there over.there yonder
     ‘Bottles are here / over here / there / over there / there yonder.’     Group II deictic locative pronouns (ààn, èàn, ááìn, èvbò) co-occur with count
and mass nouns. As vbi complement, Group II pronouns co-occur with subjects that
are animate/inanimate count nouns, place nouns marked for definiteness and (con-
ceptually) nonfixed place nouns. Only éáìn fails to co-occur under these conditions.
When construed as a single countable entity, ògó occurs with Group II deictic loca-
tive pronouns.(47) ògó ríì        vbí ààn / èàn          / ááìn / èvbò.
     bottle PRP.be LOC here over.here there yonder
     ‘A whole bottle is here / over here / there / there yonder.’When the definite article marks ògó it as singular (ólì) or plural (élì), it co-occurs
with Group II deictic locative pronouns.(48) ólì / élì ògò ríì        vbì ààn / èàn          /    ááìn / èvbò.
     the       bottle PRP.be LOC here over.here there               yonder
     ‘The bottle/bottles is/are here / over here / there / there yonder.’Inanimate count noun subjects, regardless of whether they occur as bare nouns or
as modified by the definite article (singular ólí or plural élí), appear with Group II
deictic locative pronouns.(49) a. údò / úgbàn ríì           vbí ààn / èàn         / ááìn / èvbò.
        stone / thorn PRP.be LOC here over.here there yonder

        the stones / thorns PRP.be LOC here over.here there yonder
        ‘The stones / thorns are here / over here / there / there yonder.’Group II forms co-occur with animate subjects marked as definite. Subjects can be
singular or plural human (ólí óvbèkhàn/élí ívbèkhàn), as well as singular or plural
animate (ólí ófè/élí éfè).

        the rats PRP.be LOC here over.here there              yonder

     the rice PRP.be LOC here over.here there              yonder
     ‘The rice is here / over here / there / there yonder.’Subjects for Group II can be nonfixed place nouns like ímè ‘farm’ and édà ‘river,’
regardless of definiteness marking. Other nouns that behave similarly are úgbìdì
‘graveyard,’ èràì ‘swamp,’ and ìdì ‘grave.’(52) a. ímè / ólí ímè ríì          vbí ààn / èàn         / ááìn / èvbò.

non-human animate count noun subjects that are inflectionally singular or plural
and are unmodified.(53) a. óvbèkhàn / ívbèkhàn ríì            vbí ààn / ááìn / èvbò.

ject. They co-occur with first person singular pronoun i ‘I.’
258 | Pronouns and conjunction(54) ì ríì     vbí ààn / èàn.
     I PRP.be LOC here over.here
     ‘I am right here / over here.’    The Group V deictic locative pronoun (èvbò) appears with fixed-place nouns as
subject in contrast to nonfixed place nouns (e.g. ímè ‘farm,’ édà ‘river’). Subjects
compatible with Group V include place nouns (e.g. úgbó' ‘forest’) or village sites
(áfúzé' ‘Afuze’), both of which are assumed to be situationally fixed.(55) a. úgbó' ríì       vbí èvbò.

        ‘A forest is there yonder.’
     b. áfúzé' ríì      vbí èvbò.
        Afuze PRP.be LOC yonder
        ‘Afuze is there yonder.’5.6 Impersonal pronouns
Impersonal pronouns reflect demonstrative, kindred, quantifying and numeral clas-
ses. All but demonstrative are identical in phonological shape to corresponding
nominal postdeterminer modifiers (Chapter 4, 4.3.2). Except for numerals and uni-
versal quantifiers, impersonal pronouns inflect for number with a vowel prefix. And
all except numerals show a nondeictic, contrastive member.
     Demonstrative pronouns include deictic and nondeictic, contrastive members.
Deictic demonstrative pronouns differentiate proximal/distal through their root and
express number by vowel prefix alternation: óáìn ‘that one,’ ònà ‘this one,’ éáìn
‘those ones,’ ènà ‘these ones.’ Their root forms are identical in phonological shape
to demonstrative postdeterminer modifiers, i.e. áìn, nà. Deictic demonstrative pro-
nouns reject all modifier types. A nondeictic, contrastive demonstrative pronoun
also conveys number by vowel prefix alternation: ónóì ‘next one,’ énóì ‘next ones.’
     In contrast to other impersonal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns never occur
as head of a partitive vbi phrase (*óáín/óná/ónóí vbí élí ívbèkhàn ‘that one/this
one/the next one of the youths’). Constrained by number, demonstrative pronouns
occupy noun phrase positions. They refer to participants in the situational context.(56) a. óná / óáín        wéló'       ólì òtòì.
        this.one that.one PAP.sweep the floor
        ‘This one / That one swept the floor.’
     b. ónóí      ló     wèlò ólì òtòì.
        next.one PRED sweep the floor
        ‘The next one will sweep the floor.’
                                                            Impersonal pronouns | 259Demonstrative pronouns that are plural, éná / éáín ‘these ones / those ones’ and
énóí ‘the next ones,’ do not co-refer to an antecedent in a preceding sentence.(57) a.*élí ívbèkhàn èvá ó'           vbì ìwè.
         the youths two PAP.enter LOC house
         ‘The two youths entered the house.

     b. *élí ívbèkhàn ò ó ò        vbí ìwè.

         ‘The youths are entering the house.

            next.ones PRED sweep the floor
            The next ones will sweep the floor.’Deictic demonstrative pronouns interact with deictic elements elsewhere in a
clause. They are incompatible with locative reference points specified as clauses
within which a deictic pronoun (e.g. í ‘I’) occurs. The contrastive demonstrative
pronoun is not restricted in this same fashion.(58) a. *ònà / óáìn         ríì     vbí ébé' í ríì.
         this.one that.one PRP.be LOC where I PAP.be
        ‘This / That one is where I am.’
     b. ónóì       ríì     vbí ébé' í ríì.
         next.one PRP.be LOC where I PAP.be
         ‘The next one is where I am. / The one at hand is where I am.’     Kindred pronouns exhibit deictic as well as nondeictic, contrastive forms. For
deictic kindred, proximal/distal is conveyed by two root morphemes and singu-
lar/plural by vowel prefix alternation. Among older Emai speakers, four deictic
kindred forms reflecting proximal/distal and singular/plural are available: ónìná
‘this kind of one,’ énìná ‘these kind of ones,’ ólìyó ‘that kind of one,’ élìyó ‘those kind
of ones.’ Younger speakers utilize only the erstwhile plural forms élìyó and énìná for
deictic kindred pronoun relations. Irrespective of age group, there is a nondeictic,
contrastive kindred pronoun. It inflects for number through vowel prefix alterna-
tion: ódàn ‘one of different kind,’ édàn ‘ones of different kind.’
     The contrastive kindred singular form partially reduplicates and exhibits dis-
tributive reference (ódòódàn ‘ones of a different kind’). There is no comparable plu-
ral form (*édèédàn ‘ones of different kind’). Contrastive kindred ódán occurs in a
partitive phrase as head relative to an immediately following vbi preposition and its
260 | Pronouns and conjunctioncomplement. The complement can be headed by a relational noun such as úsèé
‘crowd’ followed by Associative ísì and a plural nominal. However, plural vbi phrase
complements that lack a relational noun like úsèé are unacceptable (*ódán vbí élí
íkpùn ‘different kind of one from the cloths’).ódán            vbí úsèé ísì ìyáín

tence.(60) a. *élí ópìà ríì        vbí ìtébù. ò nwú           élìyó    ó vbì ò.

         ‘The cutlasses are on the table. He put a different kind on it.’     Kindred pronoun énìná ‘one of this kind’ displays combinatorial potential rela-
tive to postnominal modifiers. In doing so, it neutralizes the plural number value of
its prefix. énìná combines with the contrastive demonstrative modifier, although not
with either deictic demonstrative.énìná     nóì                              *énìná      nà / àìn

ing in phonological shape to its nominal modifier counterpart. Quantifier pronouns
do not reflect person, case, gender, or discourse status. Existential quantifier forms
inflect for number via prefixation.
     Universal quantifier pronouns manifest the types collective (èrèmé ‘all, every-
one, everything’) and distributive (òdóòdé ‘each one’). Distributive exhibits limited
occurrence, since it refers only to humans. Existential quantifiers show contrasting

ésò ‘certain ones’ and óvbèé ‘another one,’ évbèé ‘other ones.’
     Quantifiers in partitive vbi phrases exhibit restricted distribution. Partitive exis-
tential ósò appears as head relative to a prepositional vbi phrase, whose comple-
ment is marked inflectionally (e.g. ívbèkhàn not óvbèkhàn) or syntactically (e.g. élí)
as plural or is construed as plural.ósó vbí élí émà / élí ívbèkhàn / *ólí óvbèkhàn

        ‘Ohi took a certain one / another one to market.’     Quantifier pronouns, as anaphors, show distinct distribution patterns. Collec-
tive universal quantifier èrèmé co-refers to an antecedent noun phrase in a preced-
ing sentence.(62) òjè tón      élí émà. ò húá           èrèmé yé      èkìn.

other.one move.to market] ‘Oje harvested the yams. He took another one to market’).
    Nonetheless, partitive existential ósò occurs with a following vbi phrase and its
nondeictic locative pronoun ò as complement (ósó vbì ò). Through obligatory con-
strual of the vbi complement as plural, and direct coreference of this complement
with an antecedent noun phrase, ósò co-refers indirectly. No other quantifier dis-
plays similar indirect anaphoric behavior.(63) a. òjè tón       élí émà.
        Oje PRP.dig the yam
            ò nwú        ósó        vbì ò yé        èkìn.

             he PRP.take all      each    LOC it move.to market
         ‘Oje harvested the yams. He took all / each of them to market.’    Numeral pronouns greater than ‘one’ include the types cardinal (e.g. èvá ‘two’),
ordinal (e.g. ózèvà ‘second’), collective (e.g. èvèvá ‘all two, both, twosome’) and
distributive (e.g. èvéèvá ‘two-two each’). Each type is identical in phonological
shape to its corresponding postdeterminer. Numeral òkpá ‘one’ shows distinct car-
dinal (òkpá ‘one’) and distributive forms (òkpóòkpá ‘one-one each’). And since it
expresses ‘same’ with respect to kin relations, it reflects a collective sense as well.
     Numeral pronouns occur in the syntactic relations subject and direct object,
where they refer to participants in the situational context. Only ordinal forms re-
quire the definite predeterminer.(64) a. èvá / ólí ózèvà / èvèvá ríì        vbí èkìn.

numeral pronouns occur as partitive head, where they are followed by a preposi-
tional vbi phrase whose complement consists of a plural lexical form or the nondeic-
tic locative pronoun ò. Deictic locatives (e.g. èvbò) as complement are disallowed.èvá vbí élí émà / élí ívbèkhàn / *ólí óvbèkhàn

‘one of the youths’                      ‘one of the youths’    Numeral pronouns do not uniformly appear as anaphors. Collective (èvèvá) and
cardinal (èvá) numeral shapes corefer to a noun phrase referent in a preceding sen-
tence. Distributive (èvéèvá) and ordinal (ólí ózèvà) numerals, however, fail to co-
refer in a similar fashion.

          ‘Oje harvested the yams. He took the second one to market.’As found with the partitive existential quantifier, cardinal numerals can co-refer
indirectly. When head of a partitive phrase, a cardinal numeral (through its vbi
phrase complement, nondeictic locative pronoun ò) indirectly co-refers to a noun
phrase in a preceding sentence. Remaining numeral forms fail to co-refer indirectly.(66) a. òjè tón        élí émà. ò húá         èvá vbì ò yé         èkìn.

Four interrogative pronouns occur in Emai. All but one exhibit variation in phono-
logical shape of their final vowel conditioned by the nature of the following phono-
logical segment. When they are followed by a vowel or a clause boundary, their final
vowel is [e]. When followed by a consonant, their final vowel is [i]. Interrogative
pronouns reflect four gender distinctions: animate, inanimate, place, and amount.
Only animate reveals a singular/plural number prefix. Interrogative pronouns are
also co-indexed to a matrix clause position expressed as a pronoun or a zero pro-
266 | Pronouns and conjunctionnoun. To form question categories beyond these four, interrogative pronouns com-
bine with lexical or grammatical morphemes (Chapter 7, 7.5.2).óé', óí' / éé', éí'                   ékà
‘who’ sg / pl                         ‘how many / how much’
émé' / émí'                           ébé' / ébí'
‘what’                                ‘where’    The animate interrogative pronoun pair óé'/ói' ‘who sg’ and éé'/éí' ‘who pl’
show an initial vowel alternation that reflects number. Each requires number
agreement vis-à-vis its corresponding matrix clause position (e.g. subject ó ~ é or
direct object óì ~ íyàìn).(67) a. óé' ó / éé' é      híán'     ólí óràn?
        who he who they PAP.cut the wood
        ‘Who cut the wood?’
     b. óé' / éé' ójé fí'       óí / íyáín úkpóràn?
        who who Oje PAP.hit him them stick
        ‘Whom did Oje hit with a stick?’The number contrast for the animate interrogative is retained even when the corre-
sponding matrix position shows a zero pronoun, as with indirect object position
following Applicative li/ni.(68) óé' / éé'   ólí ómóhé ré'       émà ní?
     whom whom the man PAP.take yam APP
     ‘Whom did the man give yam to?’The animate interrogative’s final vowel alternates. When the following segment is a
consonant, the pronoun final vowel is [i], regardless of referent number.(69) óí' / éí'   vbá ré'         émà ní?
     whom whom you PAP.take yam APP
     ‘Whom did you give yam to?’When the following segment is a vowel or when the interrogative pronoun occurs in
situ (i.e. echo questions), the pronoun final vowel is [e], regardless of number.(70) a. óé' / éé'    ó ré'         émà ní?
        whom whom he PAP.take yam APP
        ‘Whom did he give yam to?’

        he PAP.take yam APP whom whom
        ‘He gave yam to whom?’    Interrogative pronoun émé'/émí' does not inflect for number. It reveals final
vowel alternation [e ~ i] conditioned by the following phonological segment. When a
consonant follows, the pronoun final vowel is [i]. When a vowel follows or when the
pronoun occurs in situ in an echo question (ò ú émèé? [he PRP.do what] ‘He did
what?’), the final segment is [e].(71) émí' vbá ú'-ì?                      émé' ó ú'-ì?
     what you PAP.do-F                   what he PAP.do-F
     ‘What did you do?’                  ‘What did he do?’The émé'/émí' interrogative corresponds to different matrix clause grammatical
relations as indicated by pronoun shape. Relative to subject position, émé'/émí'
corresponds to a definite personal pronoun such as ó.(72) émé' ó sá'        ólí ómòhè?
     what it PAP.sting the man
     ‘What stung the man?’For other grammatical relations, single verb direct objects, direct objects after a verb
in series (re) or direct objects followed by li/ni indirect objects, émé'/émí' corre-
sponds to a zero pronoun.(73) a. émé' ólí ómóhé é'-ì?
        what the man PAP.eat-F
        ‘What did the man eat?’
     b. émé' ólí ómóhé ré'         híán ólí óràn?
        what the man PAP.use cut the wood
        ‘What did the man use to cut the wood?’
     c. émé' ólí ómóhé ré'          lí   ònwìmè?
        what the man PAP.take APP farmer
        ‘What did the man give to the farmer?’     The interrogative pronoun for place shows final vowel alternation between [e ~
i] conditioned by phonological context. When a consonant follows, pronoun final
vowel is [í]. When in situ (òjè yé ébèé'? [Oje PRP.move.to where] ‘Oje went where?’)
or when a vowel follows, the pronoun final vowel is [é].

     where you PAP.move.to-F           where he PAP.move.to-F
     ‘Where did you move to?’          ‘Where did he move to?’The place interrogative pronoun never corresponds to a grammatical pronoun in its
matrix clause. It consistently corresponds to a zero pronoun. When place in the
matrix clause articulates an adjunct relation, the matrix clause verb phrase shows
an obligatory locational verb za in series.(75) a. ébé' ó zá'            ù?
        where he PAP.be.loc die
        ‘Where did he die?’
     b. ébé' ó zá'            fí óí émì?

        ‘Where did he hit him?’
     c. ébé' ólí ómóhé zá'            híán ólí óràn?
        where the man PAP.be.loc cut the wood
        ‘Where did the man cut the wood?’When the matrix place relation is subcategorized as verb argument, za is disal-
lowed. No other marking of place relation in the matrix clause occurs.(76) a. ébé' ólí ókpósó (*zá) ríì?
        where the woman be.loc PAP.be
        ‘Where is the woman?’
     b. ébé' ólí ókpósó (*zá) ó'-ì.
        where the woman be.loc PAP.enter-F
        ‘Where did the woman enter?’     The quantity interrogative pronoun ékà exhibits a constant phonological shape.
Its form is not conditioned by number or phonological environment. ékà corre-
sponds to different anaphoric shapes in the matrix clause. Its corresponding subject
position requires a personal pronoun (o).(77) ékà      ó rì      vbí ááìn?
     quantity it PAP.be LOC there
     ‘How many are at that place?’ékà also corresponds to a matrix clause zero pronoun, as illustrated by the headless

"2.1.1 Noun inflectionEmai evinces a remnant gender system of number bearing prefixes attached to nom-
inal roots. Aspects of this system are also evident in prefixes attached to postnomi-
nal modifiers as well as pronouns expressing varying syntactic functions.
     Number inflection determines the shape of some nominal and modifier stems.
For a limited set of nominal roots belonging to human, animate and inanimate clas-
ses as well as body-part locus and abstractions, a number contrast is marked by
vowel prefixes. There is a tendency for singular to be realized by back, mid vowels
(o- and o-) and plural by front, non-low vowels (i-, e-, e-). It is only the mid low vow-
el (a-) that is used for singular and plural marking. Tone of the prefixal pair does not
correlate with number; nor does it correlate with gender.
     Overt number marking leading to noun class pairs and thus genders is not com-
prehensive in Emai. The number of nouns in each remnant gender is variable, some
exhibiting only a single root. And in contrast to gender systems of the Bantu type
found in other parts of Africa, no root participates in more than one noun class pair.

      Each Emai prefix pair (i.e. gender) correlates to some extent with semantic enti-
ties that fall within the classes human, animate, inanimate, abstract and/or locus.
Based on their semantic profiles, few remnant genders reflect a single identifiable
semantic class. Of Emai’s 11 genders, all with mid back vowels designating singular
(i.e. o- ~ i-, o- ~ e-, o- ~ e-, o- ~ i-) exhibit human nouns except o- ~ a-; it shows body-
part items. The gender u- ~ i- is the most clearly non-human, since it reveals all clas-
ses except human. For the most part, common nouns for flora and fauna in these
gender classes reflect a generic or basic level of abstraction. Several classes identify-
ing fauna, moreover, identify entities reflective of a pastoral lifestyle (e.g. sheep,
cow and goat), despite the fact that such a lifestyle is incompatible with the current
ecological environment of the Emai. In addition, Emai gender classes tend not to
include root forms that reflect an agricultural lifestyle (e.g yam, maize and beans).
An overall impression of Emai gender is available in Table 3, which pairs the 11 gen-
ders with each of five semantic classes.
      Based on Table 3 and the list of noun forms in each gender, we identify the se-
mantic character of Emai gender classes. The a- ~ e- gender incorporates animate
and inanimate entities: ákhè, ékhè ‘ceramic pot,’ áwà, éwà ‘dog.’ The a- ~ i- gender
subsumes human, animate and inanimate roots with recognizeable social values.
This gender applies to humans denoting lifecycle stages, birds at both the unique
beginner and mid taxonomic levels and an inanimate stem involving a complex
word form whose derivational history is no longer transparent: ágèlè, ígèlè ‘pubes-

type. In the e- ~ i- gender there is émèlá, ímèlá ‘cow’. And the e- ~ e- gender has one
root: éwè, éwè ‘goat.’
     Body part extremities are identified by the o- ~ a- gender: óbò, ábò ‘hand, fore-
leg,’ òè, àwè ‘foot, hind leg.’ The o- ~ e- gender includes human, animate, inanimate
and locus noun roots. It has roots for mid level rodent, unique beginner and socially
recognized humans as well as roots for inanimates, tree and calabash bowl, as well
as an animal body-part extremity: ófè, éfè ‘rodent, rat,’ ótù, étù ‘person, people,’
óìbó, éìbó ‘whiteman,’ óràn, éràn ‘tree, wood, stick,’ òkpàn, èkpàn ‘calabash bowl,’
óhìà, éhìà ‘hoof, claw.’ Limited to roots denoting animate nouns and socially recog-
nized humans is the o- ~ i- gender. It includes root forms for animals that are wild
(bush) or domesticated, for the human female, offspring and blood relative, and for
social roles antagonistic to societal welfare or reflective of traditional Emai occupa-
tions: óvbèè, ívbèè ‘monkey,’ óghòóghò, íghòóghò ‘female sheep,’ òkpòsò, ìkpòsò
‘woman, female,’ ómìòò, ímìòò ‘blood relative,’ òrúán, ìrúán ‘in-law,’ óghìàn, íghìàn
‘enemy,’ óhùà, íhùà ‘hunter.’
     The o- ~ e- gender prefixes attach primarily to human root forms, marriage
roles, socially defined positions at the fringe of human society, animate roots for
domestic fowl as well as insects and an abstract root with negative value: ódòn,
édòn ‘husband,’ óhà, éhà ‘wife,’ óìà, éèà ‘person, human being,’ ómèmè, émèmè
‘lunatic, madman,’ ódíòn, édíòn ‘elder,’ óbò, ébò ‘oraclist, diviner,’ òkhòì, èkhòì
‘worm,’ óókhò, éókhò ‘fowl, hen,’ òbè, èbè ‘bad, evil.’ A single abstract root with
positive value denotation defines o- ~ e-: òsèn, èsèn ‘goodness, good.’ In the o- ~ i-
gender one finds roots identifying human social roles in addition to affixal forms
reflecting nominalization (prefix added to a verb root) and synthetic compounds
(prefix added to verb plus noun). This gender also has root forms denoting male and
female humans in various life cycle stages as well as social roles and occupations:
òmòhè, ìmòhè ‘man,’ óvbèkhàn, ívbèkhàn ‘unmarried youth,’ òvíén, ìvíén ‘slave,
bonded one,’ òíé'n, ìíé'n ‘co-wife, female rival, ómòò, ímòò ‘friend, companion,’
ògbàmá , ìgbàmá ‘post pubescent male,’ óèjè, íèjè ‘chief, titled man,’ ózèwàìn,
ízèwàìn ‘wiseman, advisor, sage,’ ònwìmè, ìnwìmè ‘farmer,’ òlìmè, ìlìmè ‘farmer,’
òzètò, ìzètò ‘barber,’ óhànèvbòò, íhànèvbòò ‘judge,mediator’, ódùèkìn, ídùèkìn ‘mer-
chant, trader,’ òvìnèbè, ìvìnèbè ‘scribe, writer,’ òdènyò, ìdènyò ‘drunkard,’ òyèhón,
ìyèhón ‘deaf person,’ òrùènó, ìrùènó ‘blind person,’ óré', íré' ‘stranger, visitor.’
     The u- ~ i- gender hosts the largest number of noun roots. This gender incorpo-
rates primarily inanimate and animate roots with some from body-part locus. It has
forms denoting animal body parts, insects, artifacts and an abstract noun recogniz-
ing a basic temporal distinction: ùbèlè, ìbèlè ‘calabash, gourd,’ úgbàn, ígbàn ‘blade
of grass,’ úgùà, ígùà ‘bone joint,’ úkpàsánmì, íkpàsánmì ‘cane,’ úkpà, íkpà ‘seed,’

      Within Emai’s grammatical system, agreement or concord linked to gender is no
longer functional. Perfect aspect and prospective aspect evince no morphological
agreement marking. However, a remnant agreement system is evident in imperfect
aspect, where continuous and habitual morphemes are distinguished by tone.
      Continuous aspect in the third person is expressed by high tone ó, preceded
immediately by a low tone subject concord (SC) marker (ò) and a lexically headed
subject constituent with low tone at its right edge (ólí ómòhè, élí ímóhè).(1) ólí ómòhè / élí ímóhè ò ó è ólí émàè.
    the man      the men SC C eat the food
    ‘The man is / The men are eating food.’    Habitual is similarly framed except for tone, which in third peson is conveyed
by low tone ò preceded by a subject concord marker with high tone (ó) and a lexical-
ly headed constituent with right edge high tone (ólí ókpósó ná, élí íkpósó ná).(2) ólí ókpósó ná / élí íkpósó ná      ó ò shèn úkpùn.
    the woman this the women these SC H sell cloth
    ‘This woman sells / These women sell cloth.’     As clausal expressions in the imperfect illustrate, neither number nor gender
impacts shape of the agreement marker. There is no effect on subject concord pho-
nological shape by indexing of grammatical number in the subject constituent (pre-
determiner ólí ~ élí with o- ~ e-) or by gender contrast of lexical head nouns
(ókpósó/íkpósó with o- ~ i- or ómòhè/ímóhè with o- ~ i-). Number and gender distinc-
tions in agreement marking are thus neutralized.
     Remnant agreement is evident within noun phrases, where a select group of ad-
jectives must agree in number with their head noun. Emai attributive phrases
marked by the particle li index grammatical number on adjective forms
(òkhúá/èkhúá, óbín'/ébín') that modify gender bearing nouns. Hence, the grammati-
cal number conveyed by the initial vowel of an attributive adjective (o- for singular
and e- for plural) varies in agreement with grammatical number of the initial vowel
of the head noun (e- for singular and i- or e- for plural).

e- gender characterizes some predeterminers and postdeterminers, modifiers that
precede or follow a head noun, respectively. Included are postdeterminer stems that
serve as kindred modifiers and existential quantifiers in addition to a predeterminer
serving as definite article. Numerals (e.g. òkpá ‘one,’ èélè ‘four’) and universal quan-
tifiers (e.g. èrèmé ‘all,’ òdóòdé ‘each’) show no number prefixation, as with demon-
stratives (e.g. nà ‘this/these,’ áìn ‘that/those,’ nòì ‘next’).ólìná [ónìná] ‘this kind’                     élìná [énìná] ‘these kind’
ólìyó ‘that kind’                             élìyó ‘those kind’
ódàn ‘different kind’                         édàn ‘different kind’

óvbèé ‘another’                               évbèé ‘other’
ólì ‘the sg’                                  élì ‘the pl’    Pronoun roots inflect for number. Only the o- ~ e- gender prefix pair is evident.
Forms affected are demonstrative, kindred and existential pronouns as well as the
relative clause pronoun and the interrogative person pronoun.óáìn ‘that one’                               éáìn ‘those ones’
ònà ‘this one’                                ènà ‘these ones’
ónóì ‘next one’                               énóì ‘next ones’
ódàn ‘different kind of one’                  édàn ‘different kind of ones’
ólìyó ‘that kind of one’                      élìyó ‘those ones of that kind’
ólìná ‘this kind of one’                      élìná ‘these ones of this kind’1
ósò ‘certain one’                             ésò ‘certain ones’
óvbèé ‘another’                               évbèé ‘others’
ólì ‘the one’                                 élì ‘the ones’
óé', óí' ‘who (sg), whom’                     éé', éí' ‘who (pl), whom’    Alternating é- and í- prefixes, which do not feature in Emai’s gender system,
characterize Emai’s associative (genitive) morpheme -si. These prefixes involve an
extremely limited grammatical classification of locus or place, contrastively evident
today only with a few place nouns, e.g. ìwè ‘dwelling,’ as possessum and a posses-
26 | Morphologysor such as òjè in íwé ésì òjè ‘Oje’s temporary dwelling’ and íwé ísì òjè ‘Oje’s perma-
nent dwelling’. The é- stem, i.e. ésì, requires that one construe ìwè as a temporary
dwelling such as one might find near a farmplot, whereas the í- stem construes the
dwelling as more permanent, occurring as a house in a township. For expression of
all other possession relations, regardless of possessum noun, the form that appears
in associative expressions is ísì (Chapter 4, 4.3.3.1)2.1.3 Adverb inflectionIdeophonic adverbs (e.g. khùó) show an alternation between zero (Ø) and an i- pre-
fix that correlates, respectively, with the adverb in clause final position or clause
initial topic position.(3) a. ójé híán'    ùkèlè khùó / *ìkhùó.
       Oje PAP.cut morsel whoosh whoosh
       ‘Oje cut a morsel with a whooshing sound.’
    b. ìkhùó / *khùó,       ójé híán'   ùkèlè.
       whoosh whoosh, Oje PAP.cut morsel
       ‘With a whoosh, Oje cut a morsel.’The Ø ~ i- alternation is limited to ideophonic adverbs that refer to rate of move-
ment, spatial position, posture or sound. In English, these meanings often lexicalize
in verbs. Representative samples of each semantic subclass are shown below.2Rate:
ìbìán, ìbìánbìán / bìán ‘flash resulting from sharp contact’
ìdédédé / dédédé ‘scurried, extremely quick pace’
Spatial Distance:
ìháún, ìháúnháún / háún ‘physical distance exceeding accepted norm’
ìpìén, ìpìénpìén / pìén ‘with small bits positioned here and there’
Movement and Posture:
ìgùàghó / gùàghó ‘jerky fashion’
ìgúáhí / gúáhí ‘crumpled state’
Sound:
ìbèú / bèú ‘banging sound of a hitting activity’
ìbèú / bèú ‘sound of loud bursting into tears’Ideophonic adverbs that refer to manner rather than sound, rate, distance or motion
fail to accept the prefix i- in focus position.

píí ‘flingingly’                         húú ‘pungently’
yóò ‘whooshing’The prefix ì- is disallowed with ideophonic adverbs in topic position that exhibit
reduplication of bisyllabic high tone stems or triplication of monosyllabic high tone
stems. These adverbs tend to express manner.gbírígbírí ‘jerkily’                     dúdúdú ‘very dark’

kpíkpíkpí ‘flutteringly’                 gbágbágbá ‘slappingly’2.1.4 Verb inflectionBare verbs in a monotransitive or intransitive clause attract Factative (F) suffix -i. It
attaches to simple predicates only in perfect aspect: Present and Past. It never oc-
curs with imperfect or prospective aspect, each of which overtly marks the verb
phrase with an aspect marker such as imperfect Continuous (C) ó or prospective
predictive (PRED) ló.(4) a. ólí ómóhé lá'-ì.                 ólí ómòhè lá-ì.
       the man PAP.run-F                the man PRP.run-F
       ‘The man ran.’                   ‘The man has run.’
    b. ólí ómòhè ò ó lá / *ò ó là-ì.
       the man SC C run SC C run-F
       ‘The man is running.’
    c. ólí ómóhé ló      là vbì ìwè / *ló       là-ì vbì ìwè.
       the man PRED run LOC house PRED run-F LOC house
       ‘The man will run in the house.’Factative -i never co-occurs with any auxiliary (e.g. relative tense ke in *ólí ómóhé ké
lá-ì [the man ANT run-F] ‘The man ran afterward’) or preverb (e.g. aspectualizer gbo
in *ólí ómóhé gbó' lá-ì [the man ADD run-F] ‘The man ran too’). Factative -i only
occurs when auxiliary and preverb positions for a single verb predicate are vacant.
      Factative -i manifests polarity and mood restrictions as well. Although incom-
patible with prohibitive and negative statements, which require preverbal forms, it
is also incompatible with verbs in the imperative, where no overt marker need pre-
cede the verb. Provided a bare predicate, the Factative appears in polar questions.
28 | Morphology(5) ólí úkpùn káká-ì?
    the cloth PRP.become.dry-F
    ‘Has the cloth dried?’     In addition to aspect, auxiliary and preverb limitations, Factative -i imposes a
bare condition on the verb constituent and a displacement condition on arguments
of transitive verbs. To start, Factative is constrained by subcategorization properties
of the verb. With bare intransitive verbs, the Factative occurs.(6) a. ólí úkpùn káká-ì.
       the cloth PRP.become.dry-F
       ‘The cloth has dried.’
    b. ólì óvbèkhàn dá-ì.

       ‘The youth is tall.’
    c. ólí ómòhè lá-ì.
       the man PRP.run-F
       ‘The man has run.’When a bare intransitive verb takes a following adjunct or argument, Factative -i
shows asymmetric distribution. Bare intransitive verbs with locative adjuncts
marked by preposition vbi retain Factative -i regardless of adjunct occurrence in
canonical or noncanonical (focus marked li/ni) constructions.(7) a. ólí ómóhé múzán-í'        vbí úkpódè.

       road alone PF the man           PAP.stand-F
       ‘It was on the road alone that the man stood.’With a following argument marked by preposition vbi, bare intransitive verbs show
Factative -i only when the argument (e.g. èkìn) corresponds to a noncanonical posi-
tion, e.g. focus marked by li/ni or interrogative pronoun in information questions.(8) a. ólí ómóhé ó'            vbì èkìn.

       where the man     PAP.enter-F
       ‘Where did the man enter?’With some limitations, Factative -i attaches to a bare transitive verb whose direct
object is displaced to focus or question position in discourse. When a direct object
occupies focus li/ni or question word position, a transitive verb requires Factative -i.(9) a. ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì / *shén'.

       ‘It was yam that the man sold.’
    b. émé' ólí ómóhé shén'-ì / *shén'?
       what the man PAP.sell-F PAP.sell
       ‘What did the man sell?’     Limiting this generalization are complex predicates where a transitive verb ei-
ther shows a postverbal particle or a double object complement, occurs in series
with another verb, or incorporates grammaticalized elements. Factative -i is prohib-
ited when a verb stands in construction with a postverbal particle, either Change of
State a, Change of Location o, Applicative li/ni or Temporal Perspective lee.(10) a. ólí ákhè lí ólí ómóhé gbé'       /    *gbé'-ì         á.

        ‘It was eba (prepared cassava) alone that the youth finished eating.’Factative -i is disallowed by verbs in series. When a direct object corresponds to a
focus li/ni constituent or interrogative pronoun, no verb in series (e.g. nwu, re, re,
hian) attracts the Factative.(11) a. ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé nwú' / *nwú-í'             ré.

       what the man PAP.use PAP.use-F            cut wood
       ‘What did the man use to cut wood?’Factative -i fails to occur where an extant transitive verb shows a complex multi-
morphemic diachronic character. For instance, zawo ‘see’ has derived historically
from Deductive auxiliary za ‘must have’ and the verb ghoo (reduced to wo) ‘per-
ceive.’ zawo does not take Factative -i.(12) ólì òkpòsò lí ólí ómóhé záwó' / *záwó'-ì.
     the woman PF the man PAP.see PAP.see-F
     ‘It was the woman that the man saw.’Despite these limiting conditions, adverbial adjuncts, particularly those of time and
place, do not constrain Factative. When a direct object occupies focus position or
corresponds to an interrogative pronoun and a temporal adjunct (òdè) follows a
bare transitive verb, Factative -i remains obligatory.(13) ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé shén-í' / *shén'            òdè.
     the yam PF the man PAP.sell-F PAP.sell           yesterday
     ‘It was the yam that the man sold yesterday.’2.2 Affixal morphology
Affixal morphology in Emai subsumes processes of verbal affixation, nominaliza-
tion, compounding and reduplication. Each results in lexemes with distinct mor-
phological make up.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]"

 To clarify, an alternative linear ordering of adverb types leads to ungrammaticality, as illustrated
with the aspectual extent adverb sésésé and the temporal deixis adverb òdè.(i) a. ó wéló'         ólì òtòì    á sésésé òdè.

        ‘He swept the ground yesterday neatly.’
7 Noncanonical constructions
Noncanonical constructions in Emai express the information status of a clause or
clause constituent in discourse. Discourse-defined constructions include positive
focus (PF) and negative focus (NF), topicalization, antitopic or right dislocation,
information questions, sentence affirmation (SA) and sentence negation (SN). Each
construction is morphosyntactically marked except topicalization, where intonation
downturn follows the topic constituent. Except for sentence affirmation and sen-
tence negation, each construction is characterized by an additional constituent that
precedes or follows its matrix clause. The resulting discourse position, typically a
noun phrase, corresponds to a matrix clause grammatical relation. Each construc-
tion also co-occurs with at least one other construction type, although distinct con-
structions never affect the same matrix clause constituent.(1) a. ólí óvbékhán nà lí ó gbé'                 ólí ákhè á.

Focus constructions assume a contrast between speaker and hearer knowledge
regarding the information status of a nominal referent or predicate event. Construc-
348 | Noncanonical constructionstion purpose is to align hearer and speaker knowledge. Focus position in this con-
struction expresses information that is not shared by speaker and hearer. Its follow-
ing matrix clause conveys shared information.
     Focus position is marked in affirmative structures by the morpheme li/ni and in
negative structures by ki. Focus position immediately precedes a matrix clause and
its constituent corresponds to a grammatical relation in the matrix clause. For ex-
ample, the focus position constituent ólí émà followed by li/ni or ki corresponds to
the direct object relation following the matrix verb shen. Focus position noun
phrases manifest an unmarked tone pattern, i.e. they accept a right edge low tone.
On the other hand, focus construction matrix clauses inflect for a limited range of
aspects, all with a right edge high tone subject.(2) a. ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé ló        shèn ákhò.
       the yam PF the man PRED sell tomorrow
       ‘It was the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’
    b. ólí émà kí ólí ómóhé ló        shèn ákhò.
       the yam NF the man PRED sell tomorrow
       ‘It wasn't the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’Across affirmative and negative focus types, only positive focus allows omission of
the construction marker. When li/ni is omitted, vowel elision does not affect phono-
logical shape of either focus noun phrase (ólí émà) or matrix clause initial constitu-
ent (ólí ómóhé).(3) ólí émà ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.
    the yam the man PAP.sell-F
    ‘It was the yam that the man sold.’7.1.1 Matrix clause marking of focus relationFocus constructions show variable grammatical marking of the matrix clause posi-
tion corresponding to a focus constituent. They also limit nominal structure types in
focus position. As well, they constrain marking of their matrix clause as to inflec-
tion, auxiliaries and preverbs.
     Focus constructions mark the matrix grammatical relation corresponding to a
focus constitutent with one of three strategies. The first of these affects matrix sub-
ject, possessor or first object in a double object complement. Each shows a pronoun
corresponding to the focus position constituent. A positive or negative focus posi-
tion noun phrase (ólí ómòhè) corresponds to a third person singular pronoun (o ‘he’)
in matrix subject position.
                                                             Noun phrase focus | 349(4) ólí ómòhè lí / kí ó shén'      ólí úkpùn lí     ólì òkpòsò.
    the man PF NF he PAP.sell the cloth APP the woman
    ‘It was / wasn’t the man who sold the cloth to the woman.’Number agreement across focus and corresponding matrix clause position is re-
quired. A plural noun phrase (élí ímòhè) in focus position corresponds to third per-
son plural nominative pronoun, either e or yan depending on matrix clause aspect
(Chapter 5, 5.4).(5) a. élí ímòhè lí / kí é        gbé'       ólí ófè.
       the men PF NF they PAP.kill the rat
       ‘It was / wasn’t the men who killed the rat.’
    b. élí ímòhè lí / kí yán à gbè ófé yè             òjè.
       the men PF NF they H kill rat move.to Oje
       ‘It is / isn't the men who kill rats for Oje.’Focus position noun phrases corresponding to possessor in Associative ísì phrases
(ólì ònwìmè) require a genitive pronoun (òí) in matrix clause possessor position.(6) ólì ònwìmè lí / kí éghó' ísì òí úé'-ì.
    the farmer PF NF money ASS his PAP.be.lost-F
    ‘It was / wasn't the farmer whose money was lost.’A pronoun in matrix possessor position occurs regardless of whether the possessor
(àlèkè) precedes (external possessor, accusative case óí) or follows (internal posses-
sor, genitive case òí) the possessum.(7) a. àlèkè lí / kí ójé dó'                  óí éghó' nwú.
       Aleke PF NF Oje PAP.do.in.stealth her money take
      ‘It was / wasn't from Aleke that Oje stole the money.’
    b. àlèkè lí / kí ójé dó'                éghó' ísì òí nwú.
       Aleke PF NF Oje PAP.do.in.stealth money ASS her take
       ‘It was / wasn't from Aleke that Oje stole the money.’Pronoun marking also affects first object (ólí óvbékhán) in a double object comple-
ment. When first object position corresponds to a focus position constituent, it
shows an accusative pronoun (óí).(8) ólí óvbèkhàn lí / kí ólí ókpósó fí'      óí úkpóràn.
    the youth      PF NF the woman PAP.hit him stick
    ‘It was / wasn't the youth whom the woman hit with a stick.’
350 | Noncanonical constructions    A second marking strategy requires addition of a verb or preverb to the matrix
clause. This affects locative and manner-demonstrative adjuncts, grammatical rela-
tions not subcategorized by a verb. When a focus position noun phrase (èkìn) corre-
sponds to a locative adjunct marked by preposition vbi, the matrix clause shows
verb za ‘be located’ in series. Not retained in focus or matrix clause position is vbi.(9) èkìn     lí / kí ójé zá'         shén ólí úkpùn lí      ólì òkpòsò.
    market PF NF Oje PAP.be.loc sell the cloth APP the woman
    ‘It was / wasn't in the market Oje sold the cloth to the woman.’When a focus position constituent corresponds to a manner-demonstrative adjunct
(e.g. ìyó), the matrix clause shows an obligatory Manner preverb i.(10) ìyó    lí / kí ólí ómóhé í'             gbé ólí ófè.
     DMD PF NF the man PAP.MAN kill the rat
     ‘It was / wasn't that way that the man killed the rat.’     A third marking strategy affects remaining grammatical relations. When a ma-
trix monotransitive verb is morphosyntactically bare, i.e. contains no auxiliary or
preverb morpheme and no marker of imperfect or prospective aspect, direct object
position shows a zero pronoun and the verb displays Factative suffix -i.1 Adjunct
constituents like adverb òdè ‘yesterday’ do not upset this bare condition.(11) a. ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.
        the cloth PF NF the man PAP.sell-F
        ‘It was / wasn't the cloth that the man sold.’
     b. ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén-í'         òdè.
        the cloth PF NF the man PAP.sell-F yesterday
        ‘It was / wasn’t the cloth that the man sold yesterday.’    An additional constraint on Factative suffixation occurs under conditions of
complex predication. Factative assignment shows four exceptions, with each excep-
tion showing a zero pronoun. The exceptions have in common the addition of mor-
phological material to an otherwise simple predication. When their direct object
corresponds to a focus position constituent, split verbs do not admit Factative -i (mi
dan ‘swallow’ in ólí ómóhé mí ùkèlè dán ‘The man swallowed a morsel’).(12) ùkèlè lí / kí ólí ómóhé mí dán'.
     morsel PF NF the man PAP.swallow
     ‘It was / wasn't a morsel that the man swallowed.’
                                                            Noun phrase focus | 351Verbs within complex predicates showing postverbal particles (CS a, CL o, PA e or
APP li/ni, Chapter 9) do not accept Factitive -i when their direct object position cor-
responds to a focus constituent. Verbs like shen that take a direct object and an
indirect object (lí ólì òkpòsò) show only a zero pronoun when their direct object
position corresponds to a focus position constituent (ólí úkpùn). And verbs like gbe
that show a direct object followed by the Change of State particle a do not take Fac-
tative -i when their direct object corresponds to a focus position constituent.(13) a. ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'        lí    ólì òkpòsò.
        the cloth PF NF the man PAP.sell APP the woman
        ‘It was / wasn't the cloth that the man sold to the woman.’
     b. ákhè lí / kí ólí ómóhé gbé'           á.
        pot PF NF the man PAP.break CS
        ‘It was / wasn't a pot that the man broke.’Neither verb in a serial verb construction accepts Factative -i when its direct object
corresponds to a focus position constituent.(14) ólí ókpósó lí / kí ólí ómóhé nwú'       ólí úkpùn yé.
     the woman PF NF the man PAP.take the cloth move.to
     ‘It was / wasn't the woman who the man took the cloth to.’Finally, verb forms that over historical time have lexicalized morphological material
(e.g. zawo < ze + ao + ghoo> [cause+face+look]) never allow Factative -i when their
direct object corresponds to a focus constituent.(15) ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé zá'wò / *zá'wó'-ì.
     the cloth PF NF the man PAP.see see-F
     ‘It was / wasn't the cloth that the man saw.’     Matrix grammatical relations other than direct object also manifest the zero
pronoun strategy. When a focus constituent corresponds to matrix indirect object, a
zero pronoun occupies the matrix clause position. Under this condition, Applicative
li/ni designating indirect object in the matrix clause is consistently retained in its
postverbal position.(16) ólì òkpòsò lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'    ólí úkpùn ní.
     the woman PF NF the man PAP.sell the cloth APP
     ‘It was / wasn't the woman who the man sold the cloth to.’
352 | Noncanonical constructionsA focus constituent corresponding to a temporal adjunct also reveals a correspond-
ing matrix clause zero pronoun.(17) élélá òdè         lí / kí ólí ókpósó dé'      ògèdè.
     TP yesterday PF NF the woman PAP.buy plantain
     ‘It was / wasn't the yesterday we discussed when the woman bought plantain.’7.1.2 Focus position nominal constraintsThe noun phrase position defined by affirmative and negative focus constructions
reflects few lexical constraints. Nonetheless, it restricts lexical modification and
pronominal type. Focus position marked as affirmative or negative accepts various
nominal types ranging from proper names to count and mass nouns varying in ani-
macy. For instance, focus position accepts proper names (e.g. òlólò).(18) òlólò lí / kí ó gbé'       ólí ófè.
     Ololo PF NF he PAP.kill the rat
     ‘It was / wasn't Ololo who killed the rat.’Positive and Negative Focus positions attract unmodified human (ómòhè), nonhu-
man animate (ófè), inanimate (úkpùn) and place (èkìn) nouns, modified or not by
the definite predeterminer.2(19) a. ómòhè / ólí ómòhè lí ó gbé'            ólí ófè.
        man       the man PF he PAP.kill the rat

                                                              Noun phrase focus | 353    f. úkpùn / ólí úkpùn kí ólí ómóhé shén'          lí    ólì òkpòsò.
       cloth the cloth NF the man PAP.sell APP the woman
       ‘It wasn't cloth / the cloth that the man sold to the woman.’
    g. èkìn / ólì èkìn      lí ójé zá'          dé ólí úkpùn.
       market the market PF Oje PAP.be.loc buy the cloth
       ‘It was in a market / the market that Oje bought the cloth.’
    h. èkìn / ólì èkìn       kí ójé zá'          dé ólí úkpùn.
       market the market NF Oje PAP.be.loc buy the cloth
       ‘It wasn't in a market / the market that Oje bought the cloth.’     Focus position restricts postdeterminers in each of the classes demonstrative,
kindred, numeral and quantifier. Deictic and contrastive demonstratives modify
focus position nouns. Deictic demonstratives appear in either positive or negative
focus position: proximal nà (ólí ómóhé nà lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man this PF NF he
PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn't this man who killed the rat’) and distal áìn (ólí
ómóhé áìn lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man that PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn't
that man who killed the rat’). Contrastive demonstrative nóì, which never occurs
with the definite predeterminer, is found in affirmative but not negative focus con-
stituents (ómóhé nóì lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man next PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was
the next man who killed the rat’).
     Kindred modifiers, which never combine with the definite article, show limita-
tions across focus polarity types. Deictic kindred élìyó appears in both affirmative
and negative focus positions (ófé élìyó lí / kí ó ó' vbì òò [rat that.kind PF NF it
PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was / wasn't that kind of rat that entered the hole’). Contras-
tive kindred ódàn is restricted to positive focus position (ófé ódàn lí / *kí ó ó' vbì òò
[rat different.kind PF NF it PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was a different kind of rat that
entered the hole’).
     Quantifier types are constrained in their distribution across affirmative and
negative focus constructions. The collective universal quantifier èrèmé, with op-
tional definite predeterminer, appears in focus position, irrespective of focus polari-
ty ((élí) ímóhé èrèmé lí / kí é ó' vbì ìwè [the men all PF NF they PAP.enter LOC house]
‘It was / wasn't all the men that entered the house’). However, the distributive uni-
versal quantifier òdóòdé is never acceptable, regardless of focus polarity (*ímóhé
òdóòdé lí / kí é ó' vbì ìwè [men each PF NF they PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / was-
n't each of the men that entered the house’).
     Existential quantifiers, which never co-occur with the definite article, are not
distributed symmetrically across focus polarity types. Limited to positive focus con-
structions are partitive existential quantifier ósò (ómóhé ósò lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè
[man certain PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was a certain man who killed the rat’) and
contrastive existential quantifier óvbèé (ómóhé óvbèé lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man an-
354 | Noncanonical constructionsother PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was another man who killed the rat’). They fail
with negative focus ki.
     Cardinal numerals greater than ‘one’ appear in focus position, regardless of
their co-occurrence with the definite article, e.g. èvá ‘two’ ((élí) éfè èvá lí / kí é ó' vbì
òò [the rats two PF NF they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was / wasn't (the) two rats who
entered the hole’). Collective numerals, which do not co-occur with the definite
article, modify nouns in positive or negative focus position, e.g. èvèvá ‘both, all two
of’ (éfè èvèvá lí / kí é ó' vbì òò [rats all.two PF NF they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was /
wasn't both rats that entered the hole’). With an otherwise unmodified noun, nu-
meral òkpá ‘one’ occurs in positive or negative focus position (ómòhè òkpá lí / kí ó ó'
vbì ìwè [man one PF NF he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't one man who en-
tered the house’). In addition, emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone’ modifies nouns
marked as definite in positive or negative focus position (ólí ómòhè òkpá lí / kí ó ó'
vbì ìwè [the man alone PF NF he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't the man
alone who entered the house’).
     Focus position noun phrases also accept nonlexical postdeterminers. Focus
noun phrases take as postnominal modifiers Associative ísì phrases (éwé ísì ólì
òkpòsò lí / kí ó ó' vbì ìwè [goat ASS the woman PF NF it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was
/ wasn’t the goat of the woman that entered the house’), Relator li phrases (éwé lí
óbín' lí / kí ó ó' vbì ìwè [goat R dark PF NF it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn’t
the dark goat that entered the house’) and relative clause li/ni constituents (ómóhé lí
ó dá' ólí ényò lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man R he PAP.drink the wine PF NF he PAP.kill the
rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the man who drank the wine who killed the rat’). Speaker pref-
erence is for focus constituents without definite article ólì/élì.
     Pronominal forms also occupy focus position. Irrespective of construction polar-
ity, focus position accepts personal and impersonal pronouns. However, constraints
apply that affect case as well as person and number agreement. Among personal
pronouns, only emphatic forms (e.g. ìyàìn, mèmè) appear in focus position. Emphat-
ic personal pronouns must agree in person and number with their matrix clause
anaphoric pronoun (yan or i). Across focus polarity types, emphatic pronouns in
focus position accept emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone.’(20) a. ìyàìn / mèmè lí / kí yán / í gbé'          ólí ófè.
        they I        PF NF they I PAP.kill the rat
        ‘It was / wasn’t they / I who killed the rat.’
     b. ìyàìn òkpá lí / kí yán gbé'           ólí ófè.
        they alone PF NF they PAP.kill the rat
        ‘It was / wasn't they alone who killed the rat.’   Focus position attracts impersonal pronouns from demonstrative, kindred, nu-
meral and quantifier classes with few restrictions. Each demonstrative pronoun
                                                               Noun phrase focus | 355occurs in focus position: distal deictic óáìn (óáìn lí / kí ó gbé' ófè [that.one PF NF it
PAP.kill rat] ‘It was /wasn’t that one who killed a rat’), proximal ònà (ònà lí / kí ó
gbé' ófè [this.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It was / wasn’t this one who killed a rat’),
emphatic proximal ónánà (ónánà lí / kí ó gbé' ófè [this.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It
was / wasn’t this very one who killed a rat’), as well as contrastive demonstrative
ónóì (ónóì lí / (*kí ) ó gbé' ófè [next.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It was the next one who
killed a rat’).
     Both kindred pronouns occur in focus position: deictic élìyó (élìyó lí / kí ólí
ómóhé gbé'-ì [that.kind PF NF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't that kind of one
that the man killed’) and contrastive ódàn (ódàn lí / kí ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [differ-
ent.kind PF NF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't a different kind of one that the
man killed’).3
     Focus position accepts few quantifier pronouns.4 It takes the collective univer-
sal quantifier èrèmé (èrèmé lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [all PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F]
‘It was / wasn't all that the woman killed’). Ungrammatical in focus position are the
distributive universal quantifier òdóòdé as well as both existential pronouns (ósò
and óvbèé).
     Focus position accepts numeral pronouns greater than ‘one’ in their cardinal
form, e.g. èvá (èvá lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [two PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was
/ wasn’t two that the woman killed’) or collective form, e.g. èvèvá (èvèvá lí / kí ólí
ókpósó gbóó'-ì [all.two PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn’t both that the
woman killed’). As head of a partitive vbi phrase, cardinal numerals also occur in
focus position, e.g. èvá (èvá vbì ò lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [two LOC it PF NF the
woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't two of them that the woman killed’).5
     Numeral pronoun ‘one’ appears in focus position, as cardinal òkpá (òkpá lí / kí
ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì [one PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't one that the
woman killed’) or partitive úkpòkpá (úkpòkpá vbì ò lí /*kí ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì [one LOC
it PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was one of them that the woman killed’). Howev-
er, úkpòkpá only occurs in positive focus.
     Focus position also accepts expressions framed as pronominally headed relative
clauses (ólí ó (*á) dé' ólí úkpùn lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [one he RC PAP.buy the cloth PF
NF it PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the one who bought the cloth who killed the
rat’) or attribution phrases (ólí óbín' lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the dark.one PF NF it
PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the dark one who killed the rat’). Pronominally
headed relatives only occur in focus position under conditions of specific reference.
Generic reference (e.g. ‘whoever’) induced by Recurrent preverb a in the relative
clause renders them unacceptable.
356 | Noncanonical constructions7.1.3 Matrix clause propertiesFocus constructions constrain expression of mood and polarity as well as inflection,
auxiliaries and preverbs. Regarding mood, focus constructions never appear as
imperatives or prohibitives. Relative to polarity, both affirmative and negative focus
constructions appear as polar questions (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì? [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.sell-F] ‘Was / Wasn’t it the yam that the man sold?’).
     In their matrix clauses, affirmative focus constructions allow perfect negation
marked by ì. Negative focus constructions disallow it (ólí émá nà òkpá lí / *kí ólí
ómóhé í ì shèn [the yam this alone PF NF the man SC NEG sell] ‘It was this yam alone
which the man did not sell’).
     Matrix clauses in focus constructions limit inflection and auxiliaries. Relative to
aspect, they inflect for Past perfect, imperfect Habitual or prospective Predictive.6
All show a subject phrase with a high tone right edge. Matrix clauses in focus con-
structions reject Present perfect, imperfect Continuous or prospective Anticipative.(21) a. ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.
        the yam PF NF the man PAP.sell-F
        ‘It was / wasn't the yam that the man sold.’
     b. émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ó ò shèn.
        yam PF NF the man SC H sell
        ‘It is / isn't yam that the man sells.’
     c. ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ló           shèn.
        the yam PF NF the man PRED sell
        ‘It is / isn't this yam that the man will sell.’     Focus construction matrix clauses limit deontic and epistemic modality as well
as relative tense. Of the modality forms, deontic Hortative í is never grammatical in
focus constructions. Epistemic forms are not as restricted, even if distributionally
sensitive to focus polarity. Appearing only in negative focus is Certaintive ma (ólí
émà kí / *lí ólí ómóhé má' shèn [the yam NF PF the man PAP.CER sell] ‘It wasn't the
yam that the man surely sold’), while Dubitatives only occur in positive focus polar
interrogative constructions, e.g. bia (ólí émà lí / *kí ólí ómóhé bíá' shèn? [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.DUB sell] ‘Was it the yam that the man actually sold?’) and vba (ólí
émà lí / *kí ólí ómóhé vbá' shèn? [the yam PF NF the man PAP.DUB sell] ‘Was it the
yam that the man really could have sold?’).
     Some epistemic forms occur in affirmative and negative focus constructions:
Concessive rere (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ré'rè shén? [the yam PF NF the man
PAP.CONC sell] ‘Was / Wasn't it the yam that the man even sold?’) and Hypothetical
kha (ólí émá nà lí / kí ólí ómóhé khà shén [the yam this PF NF the man PAP.HYP sell]
‘It was / wasn't this yam that the man would have sold’). Concessive, though, re-
                                                             Noun phrase focus | 357quires a polar interrogative structure. Remaining epistemic forms reflecting rational
judgments, Deductive za and Resultative za, fail in focus constructions.
      Relative tense exponents appear in focus matrix clauses: Anterior ke (ólí émà lí /
kí ólí ómóhé ké' shèn [the yam PF NF the man PAP.ANT sell] ‘It was / wasn’t the yam
that the man sold afterward’) and Subsequent kpe (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé kpé' shèn
[the yam PF NF the man PAP.SUB sell] ‘It was /wasn’t the yam that the man sold
despite pending conditions’).
      Focus construction matrix clauses severely limit preverb occurrence. For pre-
verbs that occur, there is a tendency to require a nondeclarative, polar interrogative
structure in negative focus constructions.
      As a class, aspectualizers interact with focus construction mood and polarity.
Matrix clauses linked to a positive focus position allow aspectualizers Repetitive che
(ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé ché' shèn [the yam PF the man PAP.REP sell] ‘It was the yam
that the man sold again’), Additive gbo (émà lí ólí ómóhé gbó' è [yam PF the man
PAP.ADD eat] ‘It was yam that the man ate too’) and Durative se (émà òkpá lí ólí
ómóhé sé' shèn [yam alone PF the man PAP.DUR sell] ‘It was one yam that the man
still sold’). They reject Punctual ghe, regardless of polarity or mood.
      Negative focus matrix clauses accept all phasal aspectualizers but Punctual ghe.
They do so provided the construction assumes a polar interrogative form: che (ólí
émà kí ólí ómóhé ché' shèn? [the yam NF the man PAP.REP sell] ‘Wasn't it the yam

eat] ‘Wasn't it yam that the man also ate?’) and se (émà òkpá kí ólí ómóhé sé' shèn?
[yam alone NF the man PAP.DUR sell] ‘Wasn't it one yam that the man still sold?’).
      Boundary aspectualizers manifest three distribution patterns. Irrespective of
construction polarity or mood, one finds Conative òó (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ó ó'
shèn [the yam PF NF the man SC CON sell] ‘It was / wasn’t the yam that the man
went to sell’).
      Neither Ingressive ya nor Egressive mo occurs in focus matrix clauses. However,
their Past Absolute functions are available in positive focus: ya (ìmátó nà lí ólí
ómóhé yà dé élá úkpè [car this PF the man PAP.PA buy TP year] ‘It was this car that
the man used to buy in the year we discussed’) and mo (émá mè lí ólí ómóhé mó'
shèn [yam my PF the man PAP.PA sell] ‘It was my yam that the man at one time
sold’). With negative focus, Past Absolutes require a polar interrogative frame: ya
(ìmátó nà kí ólí ómóhé yà dé élá úkpè? [car this NF the man PAP.PA buy TP year]
‘Wasn't it this car that the man used to buy in the year we discussed?’) and mo (émá
mè kí ólí ómóhé mó' shèn? [yam my NF the man PAP.PA sell] ‘Wasn't it my yam that
the man at one time sold?’).
      Of the temporal preverbs (kpao ‘initially,’ bobo ‘promptly,’ tua ‘hurriedly’), only
kpao appears in focus matrix clauses (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé kpá'ò shén [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.earlier sell] ‘It was / wasn't the yam that the man earlier on sold’).
358 | Noncanonical constructions     From the quantity class, only nonintensifier preverbs are acceptable in focus
matrix clauses. Focus constructions reject Absolute Intensifier zemi and Nonabso-
lute Intensifier zeze. Collective gba and Emphatic Reflexive dobo nonetheless occur.
Both affirmative and negative focus accept Emphatic Reflexive dobo regardless of
mood (ólí ómòhè lí / kí ó dóbó' óì é ólí émà [the man PF NF he PAP.REFL him eat the
yam] ‘It was / wasn't the man who by himself ate the yam’).7 With Collective gba,
matrix clause is declarative under positive focus (ólí émà lí élí ímóhé gbá' è [the yam
PF the men PAP.COL eat] ‘It was the yam that the men ate together’) but interroga-
tive under negative focus (ólí émà kí élí ímóhé gbá' è? [the yam NF the men PAP.COL
eat] ‘Wasn't it the yam that the men ate together?’).
     Matrix clause focus constructions never allow any of the remaining preverbs:
evaluative duu ‘for no reason,’ woo ‘instead,’ and kuku ‘after all;’ subject attributive
dábo ‘deliberately,’ dóbo ‘mistakenly,’ dúda ‘defiantly,’ miti ‘able,’ gbúdu ‘coura-
geously,’ dégbè ‘carefully,’ totóbo intensely’ and kakégbe ‘perseveringly;’ or man-
ner-demonstrative DMD ìyó and PMD ìná.
     Additionally, focus constructions are limited by S-complement type and clause
subordination. Positive focus constructions occur under indicative and conditional
complements, marked by khi and si respectively. But they never appear under sub-
junctives signaled by li (*òjè ò ó hòò lí ólì òkpòsò lí ó shén' ólí émà [Oje SC C want

     Synthetic compound lexemes with a verb and noun stem refer to household arti-
facts, natural world entities, social roles, locations and time conditions. Their inter-
pretation reflects the relations ‘characterized by,’ ‘results from,’ or ‘used to under-
take.’ In corresponding syntactic phrases, the noun stem corresponds to a direct
object argument of the transitive verb

stem. They exhibit structural subclasses based on noun position. Verb and noun
elements forming complex synthetic compounds correspond to verb phrase syntac-
tic constituents. Prefixes in complex synthetic compounds include i-, o- and a-.
     Complex synthetic compound lexemes of one structural type consist of two verb
roots with an intervening noun stem. The two verbs encode a complex predicate of
event end state or result, with the noun serving as predication direct object. These
lexemes encode relatively few entities, covering selected food items, games, social
roles, and abstract conditions.
     Prefix i- converts end state verbs in series and their direct objects to patient
nominals denoting human social conditions. These lexemes have the interpretation
‘social condition characterized by VERB NOUN VERB.’ígbóbórù ‘embezzlement’: gbe ru ‘to embezzle,’ óbò ‘hand’

nal denoting posture. It has the sense ‘posture characterized by VERB VERB NOUN.’àkùyúókhó ‘back flip’: ku ye ‘to toss toward,’ ùòkhò ‘back’    Complex synthetic compounds of a third structural type consist of two verb
roots, each followed by a noun stem. They form with prefixes a- and o-. Each noun
serves as direct object for its preceding verb in corresponding syntactic phrases.

verb root and an adverb or adverb derived from a verb. Predominantly intransitive
verbs are involved.
    Lexemes of one structural type show a prefix, an intransitive verb and an ad-
verb. They form with one prefix, i-, which converts intransitive stative verbs and
their adverbs to agent nominals denoting human social roles. Members have the
idiomatic sense ‘one characterized by VERB ADVERB.’ìfòfòséén ‘dullard’

and postverbal particle. Particles included are Change of State (CS) a, Change of
Location (CL) o, and Applicative (APP) Change of Possession li/ni. Resulting lexemes
encode conditions or entities that assume change of some sort. Not participating in
synthetic compounds are the postverbal particles for Temporal Perspective (lee) and
Projected Adherence (e). Particle compound prefixes are i-, o-, e- and a-.

clause. Lexemes of this nature are formed from verb or copular clauses or pronomi-
nally headed relative clauses. There are three classes.
     One lexeme class involves a copula (COP) predicate and accompanying pre- and
post-copula nominals of identical phonological shape. Equational Identity copula
khi ‘be equivalent,’ pre- and post-copula position nominals, and Identity subject í
frame lexemes denoting indefinite, generic reference. They have the meaning ‘con-
dition characterized by NOUN COP NOUN.’émìíkhèmí ‘anything, whatever’

  édè ‘day,’ í ID, khi COP, édè ‘day’     Lexemes of a second class denote a bodily condition. They employ the verb vbi
‘happen to’ preceded by the nonhuman noun émì and followed by the human noun
ómò. Resulting lexemes have the idiomatic interpretation ‘bodily condition charac-
terized by NOUN VERB NOUN.’

One type of synthetic compound serves to identify a referent with respect to its parti-
tive character. Members exhibit a prefix+verb+noun morphological shape. Verbs in
partitive function synthetic compounds are sometimes difficult to identify synchron-
ically. Today they occur as verbs with limited distribution or even as adverb or ad-
jective forms that we assume derived historically from verbs.7 There are six synthetic
compound classes that bear on nominal classification.
     One synthetic compound class is formed with prefix ú-/í-, a post-verb noun and
an elided form of the verb kpa ‘apportion, give equal amounts, divide’ (òjè kpá émà
ó vbì ìtásà [Oje PRP.apportion yam CL LOC bowl] ‘Oje apportioned yam into the
bowls’). kpa compound sense results from apportioning a nominal referent by iso-
lating one part of its homogeneous mass or aggregate, any portion of which, when
isolated, is materially equivalent to any other portion.8 Lexemes in this class refer to
abstractions, locations (body part and otherwise), natural kinds and artifacts.","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"

  Complements of bi reject the quasi-placeholder nouns óìà ‘person’ and émì ‘thing,’ regardless of
modification (*ólí ómò réè bí óíà / émí lí ó dé' ré' [the baby PRP.take.after like person thing R he fall
arrive] ‘The baby takes after the person / the thing that fell’).

  The verb moe frequently anchors figurative expressions in which it collocates with an abstract or
body-part noun direct object. For these collocations, subject phrase tone marking by Past perfect
distinguishes figurative from corresponding literal meanings.ólí ómóhé móé'         èwàìn.                   ólí ómóhé móé'        únù.

‘The man is very influential.’                  ‘The man is brave.’In several respects, moe constructions contrast with those of English ‘have.’ moe is not used to
express spatial relations between two entities, as English ‘have’ does (*ólì èkpètè mòè ògèdè vbí
ókhúnmí óì [the stool PRP.have plantain LOC top it] ‘The stool has plantain on top of it’). Direct
object position for moe does not allow an associative phrase specifying or implying a possessor
noun distinct from the subject referent.*ì mòè        ópíá     ísì òì.                 *ólí ómòhè mòè        ópíá mè.

tions.ólí ópíá      ísì èé      ríì     mé vbí óbò.
the cutlass ASS your PAP.be my LOC hand
‘The cutlass of yours is in my hand. / I have your cutlass in my hand.’The verb moe also collocates with nominalized intransitive verbs to convey an intensity function vis-
à-vis constructions with an intransitive predicate and Habitual aspect.ólí ómòhè mòè           òjàjà.                  ólí ómóhé ó ò jàjá.

‘The man is full of energy.’                    ‘The man is energetic.’26
  Subject position with moe differentially constrains the quasi-placeholder nouns óìà ‘person’ and
émì ‘thing.’ óìà occurs only when modified by a relative clause (óíá lí ólí ómóhé sá' óí ávbòhà mòè
íkèké [person R the man PAP.slap him shoulder PRP.have bicycle] ‘The person whom the man
slapped on the shoulder has a bicycle’) or attributive phrase (óíá lí óbé / *óíà ó ò mòè éghó' [person R
bad person SC H have money] ‘The bad person has money / gets rich’). émì is disallowed, regardless
of modifier type (*émí lí ólí ómóhé dé-í' vbì èkìn mòè àwè èéà [thing R the man PAP.buy-F LOC mar-
ket PRP.have legs three] ‘The thing that the man bought in the market has three legs’).

  moe construction direct object position restricts the quasi-placeholder nouns óìà ‘person’ and émì
‘thing.’ It accepts óìà only in an idiomatic sense, ‘person of influence’ (ólì òkpòsò mòè óìà / éìà [the
woman PRP.have person persons] ‘The woman has influence’). Even when modified this is so (ólì
òkpòsò mòè éíá lì èkhúá [the woman PRP.have persons R important] ‘The woman is related to im-
portant people’). In contrast, émì occurs when unmodified (ólì òkpòsò mòè émì [the woman
PRP.have thing] ‘The woman has something / property / things’, *ólì òkpòsò mòè émí lí ó dé-í' vbì
èkìn [the woman PRP.have thing R she PAP.buy-F LOC market] ‘The woman has something that she
bought in the market’).
9 Postverbal particles in complex predicates
Emai verb phrases show complex predicates framed by postverbal particles in con-
struction with verb forms. Each verb-particle predication type is associated with
multiple semantic functions. Nonetheless, each in its principal function signals
either Change of Possession (Applicative, APP) li/ni, Change of Location (CL) o,
Change of State (CS) a, Projected Change of Location with Adherence (PAD) e, or
Temporal Perspective (TEMP) lee.(1) a. òjè shén      émà lí      ólì ònwìmè.
       Oje PRP.sell yam APP the farmer
       ‘Oje sold yam to the farmer.’
    b. òjè nwú        émà ó vbí úkpódè.
       Oje PRP.take yam CL LOC road
       ‘Oje put yam onto the road.’
    c. òjè gbé          ólí ákhè á.
       Oje PRP.break the pot CS
       ‘Oje broke the pot.’
    d. òjè óhó         ólì úshé'n kú         é   ólì òkpòsò.
       Oje PRP.blow the powder disperse PAD the woman
       ‘Oje blew the powder all over the woman.’
    e. òjè é          ólí émàè léé.
       Oje PRP.eat the food TEMP
       ‘Oje finished eating all the food.’     Two Emai particles specify event aspect (CS and TEMP), while three characterize
argument structure. Particle co-occurrence relates to function. Temporal Perspective
lee combines with each of the other particles. Change of State, Change of Location
and Projected Adherence are mutually exclusive. Change of State and Change of
Location each combine with Applicative li/ni, although not when the latter marks
Change of Possession recipient. Instead, li/ni in these constructions with CS a and
CL o codes a benefactive semantic role.(2) a. òjè ò ó fòò ólí ómí á lì          àlèkè.
       Oje SC C cool the soup CS APP Aleke
       ‘Oje is cooling down the soup for Aleke.’
    b. òjè ré        óbò ó vbí ébè lí           àlèkè.
       Oje PRP.put finger CL LOC paper APP Aleke
       ‘Oje signed the paper for Aleke.’
518 | Postverbal particles in complex predicates     Particle tone value in transitive predications tends to harmonize or contrast
with its preceding verb depending on structural conditions. Moreover, particles
exhibit tone behavior distinct from adverbials, since they fail to induce high tone
spread at right edge of a preceding direct object constituent. No postverbal particle
serves as a simple predicate.
     In this chapter as well as Chapters 10, 11 and 12 addressing other complex predi-
cations, we detail a range of structural properties for each predication type. These
include component verbs and related noun phrases as well as restrictions concern-
ing inflectional aspect, polarity and mood, possible repositioning of arguments to
discourse prominent positions and predication response to aspectually sensitive
question types. The latter take the shape of discourse frames incorporating
émé'/émí' NP ú ‘What did someone do?’ and émé'/émí' ú ‘What happened?’.1(3) a. émé' ójé ú'-ì?
       what Oje PAP.do-F
       ‘What did Oje do?’
    b. émé' ó ú'?
       what it PAP.happen
       ‘What happened?’9.1 Applicative
Complex predicates coded by postverbal Applicative (APP) li/ni and its nominal
complement express recipient or beneficiary relations conveyed in English by
‘to/for’ or ‘from.’ Component verbs are transitive or intransitive.
     Applicative form varies according to its complement. Its li exponent occurs with
a lexical noun complement. The ni form appears with a pronoun complement or
when the Applicative is stranded in postverbal position, as in positive focus (PF)
constructions marked by li/ni.(4) a. ólì òkpòsò shén       émà lí   ònwìmè.
       the woman PRP.sell yam APP farmer
       ‘The woman sold yam to the farmer.’
    b. ólì òkpòsò shén       ólí émà ní áìn.
       the woman PRP.sell the yam APP him
       ‘The woman sold the yam to him.’
    c. ólí ónwímé nà lí ólí ókpósó shén'      émà ní.
       the farmer this PF the woman PAP.sell yam APP
       ‘It was this farmer who the woman sold yam to.’
                                                                  Applicative | 519Applicative li/ni complements require dative pronouns (e.g. áìn ‘him,’ Chapter 5),
which differ in phonological shape from accusative pronouns (e.g. óì ‘him’). Applic-
ative li/ni does not accept place nouns (e.g. áfúzé' ‘Afuze’) or ellipted associative
phrases of place marked by ésì/ísì.(5) àlèkè shén      ólí émà ní áìn / *óì / *áfúzé' / *ésì ònwìmè.
    Aleke PRP.sell the yam APP him him Afuze ASS farmer
    ‘Aleke sold the yam to him.’    In complex predicates with verbs of financial transaction (shen ‘sell,’ de ‘buy’)
and thus possession change, Applicative li/ni codes event Recipient.(6) a. ólì òkpòsò shén    émà lí     ònwìmè.
       the woman PRP.sell yam APP farmer
       ‘The woman sold yam to the farmer.’
    b. ólì òkpòsò dé      émà lí     ònwìmè.
       the woman PRP.buy yam APP farmer
       ‘The woman bought yam for the farmer.’Recipient li/ni also co-occurs with transitive verbs of object manipulation, e.g. nwu
‘take hold’ and roo ‘pick up.’ Predication sense is ‘give.’ Independent of the li/ni
construction, manipulation verbs like nwu with only a direct object complement
convey the sense ‘carry,’ not ‘give.’(7) a. ólì òkpòsò nwú       émà lí    ònwìmè.
       the woman PRP.take yam APP farmer
       ‘The woman gave yam to the farmer.’
    b. ólì òkpòsò nwú       ólí émà.
       the woman PRP.take the yam
       ‘The woman has carried the yam.’
    c. ólí ómòhè róó           ùhàì lí    òhí.
       the man PRP.pick.out arrow APP Ohi
       ‘The man picked out an arrow for Ohi.’Recipient li/ni predications also accept transitive verbs like re, which fail as simple
predicates.(8) ólì òkpòsò ré      émà lí  òhí / *ré émà.
    the woman PRP.take yam APP Ohi take yam
    ‘The woman gave pounded yam to Ohi.’
520 | Postverbal particles in complex predicates     Recipient li/ni predications require permanent possession exchange. Entity
transfer from one person to another or location change without possession change
is not sufficient, as with the projection and release verb fi ‘throw.’(9) *ólì òkpòsò fí        ùgbòfì lí    ònwìmè.
    the woman PRP.throw orange APP farmer
    ‘The woman threw an orange to the farmer.’Recipient li/ni predications contrast with complex allative ‘take’ predications
marked by ye ‘move to’ in series. Allative conveys temporary possession change.(10) a. ólì òkpòsò nwú       émà yé        ònwìmè.
        the woman PRP.take yam move.to farmer
        ‘The woman took yam to the farmer (carrying it).’
     b. ólí ómòhè róó            ùhàì yé          òhí.
        the man PRP.pick.out arrow move.to Ohi
        ‘The man took an arrow to Ohi (picking it out).’    Complex predicates with li/ni recipients reveal additional properties when ex-
pressing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as
discourse repositioning of arguments. Recipient li/ni predications do not restrict
aspect. They inflect for Present perfect (right edge low tone subject phrase) and Past
perfect (right edge high tone subject phrase) as well as imperfect Continuous.(11) a. ólì òkpòsò shén    émà lí     ònwìmè.

questions.(12) émé' áléké ú'-ì?    > ò shén      émà lí    ònwìmè.

     what it PAP.happen Aleke PAP.sell yam APP farmer
     ‘What happened?’    ‘Aleke had sold yam to a farmer.’With polarity and mood, li/ni recipient predications are unrestricted. They appear as
imperatives, prohibitives, negative statements and polar questions.(14) a. shèn émà lí      ònwìmè.
        sell yam APP farmer
        ‘Sell yam to a farmer.’
     b. é è shén émà lí         ònwìmè.

        the woman PRP.sell yam APP the farmer
        ‘Did the woman sell yam to the farmer?’Complex predicates with recipient li/ni also do not inhibit discourse repositioning of
their arguments. Subject, direct object and li/ni complement correspond to a focus
position constituent.(15) a. ólí ókpósó nà lí ó shén'         émà lí   ònwìmè.
        the woman this PF she PAP.sell yam APP farmer
        ‘It was this woman who sold yam to a farmer.’

        farmer PF the woman PAP.sell yam APP
        ‘It was a farmer that the woman sold yam to.’     Complex li/ni predicates express a range of argument roles or functions in addi-
tion to recipient. These are beneficiary, aversive and addressee. Each is briefly illus-
trated below.
     li/ni complements identify event beneficiary, an argument of the predication
that benefits in some way from an event (Blake 2001). Beneficiary functions occur
with simple predicates (hóó ‘wash) and complex predicates (nwú móé ‘hold’).

        the woman SC C wash cloth APP the farmer
        ‘The woman is washing clothes for the farmer.’Regarding discourse repositioning, beneficiary li/ni predications are partially re-
stricted. Their subjects and direct objects correspond to focus position constituents
but li/ni complements do not.(18) a. ólí ókpósó nà lí ó hóó'                úkpùn lí   ólì ònwìmè.

event participant is avoided (Blake 2001). Aversive complements are limited to hu-
man nouns. They reject nouns for nonhuman, animate (ólí áwà) or inanimate place
(ólì èvbòò). li/ni aversives are found with intransitive and transitive verbs.

restrictions. Subject and direct object correspond to a focus position constituent but
li/ni addresse does not.

         ‘It was this man that Aleke narrated a saying to.’9.2 Change of location
Complex predicates consisting of transitive or intransitive verbs and CL o express
change of location. CL o takes a complement headed by locative preposition vbi. The
semantic nature of vbi complements influences the functional character of CL predi-
cations. Other functions associated with CL o include temporal demarcation, spatial
demarcation, quantitative demarcation, displacive commodity and state change.
     Change of location predications with CL o express a change of location for tran-
sitive direct objects (e.g. ìtáì ‘tie’ and úkpúì ‘rope’).(27) a. ólí ómòhè dín     ìtáì     ó vbì ùrùn.
        the man PRP.tie necktie CL LOC neck
        ‘The man tied on a necktie / put on a necktie.’
     b. ólì òkpòsò dín      úkpúì ó mé vbí óbò.
        the woman PRP.tie rope CL my LOC arm
        ‘The woman tied a rope onto my arm.’Verbs in CL o predications often exhibit a sense shift when occurring as a transitive
predicate. With verbs of object manipulation, e.g. nwu ‘take hold,’ the meaning
contrast is between ‘carry’ with a direct object and ‘put’ with direct object and CL
phrase.2(28) a. ólì òkpòsò nwú       émà.
        the woman PRP.take yam
        ‘The woman carried / *put yam.’
     b. ólì òkpòsò nwú       émà ó vbí úkpódè.
        the woman PRP.take yam CL LOC road
        ‘The woman put / *carried yam onto the road.’A substantial inventory of transitive manner of manipulation verbs appear in CL o
predications that translate English ‘put.’ Some are illustrated below.3

        the man PRP.thread bead CL LOC string
        ‘The man put / threaded beads onto a string.’A few object manipulation verbs (e.g. re ‘take,’ ban ‘remove’) fail as simple predi-
cates. They require a CL phrase or some other suitable change of state predicate.(30) a. àlèkè ré        íkìó      ó vbì èò / *ré íkìó.
        Aleke PRP.take mascara CL LOC face take mascara
        ‘Aleke put mascara onto her face.’
     b. òjè bán          úkpùn ó vbì òtòì      / *bán     úkpùn.
        Oje PRP.remove cloth CL LOC ground remove cloth
        ‘Oje removed his clothes onto the ground / undressed.’CL o requires a vbi phrase with a following noun phrase as complement. For the
change of location function, vbi complements are headed by place nouns or nouns
construable as place. Human noun complements of vbi are ungrammatical.(31) *ólí ómòhè dín       úkpùì ó vbí ólí óvbèkhàn.
      the man PRP.tie rope CL LOC the youth
      ‘The man tied a rope onto the youth.’When the noun in a vbi complement refers to a body part possessum (óbò), either of
two syntactic relations obtain. If the corresponding possessor (mé) appears external
to the possessum phrase, i.e. between CL o and vbi, the possessum is construed as
inalienably related to possessor. If the possessor appears within the possessum

related to possessor.(32) ólí ómòhè dín       úkpùì ó mé vbí óbò.
     the man PRP.tie rope CL my LOC arm
     ‘The man tied a rope onto my arm.’vbí complements in CL o predications accept locative pronouns that are deictic (èvbò
‘there yonder’ and ááìn ‘there) or nondeictic (o).(33) ólì òkpòsò nwú      ólí émà ó vbì èvbò / ááìn / ò.
     the woman PRP.take the yam CL LOC yonder there          it
     ‘The woman put the yam onto there yonder / there / it.’    Complex predicates with CL o display additional properties in expressions of
aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as argument reposition-
ing. CL o predications inflect for Present and Past perfect as well as imperfect Con-
tinuous, with CL o tone and verb tone harmonizing in transitive constructions.4(34) a. ólì òkpòsò nwú       émà ó vbí úkpódè.

     what it PAP.happen   Oje PRP.take yam CL LOC road
     ‘What happened?’     ‘Oje put yam onto the road.’As to polarity and mood, location change CL o predications are unrestricted. They
appear as imperatives, prohibitives, negative statements and polar questions.

        Oje PRP.take yam CL LOC road
        ‘Did Oje put yam onto the road?’Complex predicates with CL o do not inhibit discourse repositioning of arguments.
Predication subjects, direct objects and locative complements correspond to focus
position marked by li/ni.(38) a. òjè lí ó nwú'          ólí émà ó vbí úkpódè.
        Oje PF he PAP.take the yam CL LOC road
        ‘It was Oje who put the yam onto the road.’
     b. ólí émá áìn lí ójé nwú'           ó vbí úkpódè.

        ‘It was that yam that Oje put onto the road.’
     c. úkpódé nà lí ójé nwú'            ólí émà ó.
        road     this PF Oje PRP.take the yam CL
        ‘It was this road that Oje put the yam on.’     Five other functions associate with CL o. In large measure, these functions re-
flect verb semantics (change of state or change of location) or vbi phrase nominal.
One function occurs when vbi complement is headed by a time nominal (e.g. éghè
‘time’). In such instances CL o predications convey event temporal goal.(39) a. ólì òkpòsò é         émàè ó vbí éghè.
        the woman PRP.eat food CL LOC time
        ‘The woman ate on time.’

        Oje ASS Oke PRP.schedule war        CL LOC 9.days today
        ‘The Oje of Oke scheduled the war for a fortnight from today.’Complex predicates with CL o, instead of specifying a final destination, articulate a
locative reference point function for an event. This occurs when predication verb
                                                           Change of location | 529specifies change of state or change of position for the subject argument, as in fu
‘waste,’ ghogho ‘break,’ and fi ‘leave.’(40) a. ìbòbòdí fú'         ó vbí ímè.
        cassava PAP.waste CL LOC farm
        ‘Cassava wasted on the farm.’
     b. ólí ómòhè gúóghó       úkpàsánmì ó mé vbì òè.

        ‘The man broke a cane on my foot.’
     c. ólì òkpòsò fí          ólí úkpùn ó vbì ìwè.
        the woman PRP.leave the cloth CL LOC house
        ‘The woman left the cloth at home.’A third function results when vbi’s complement consists of a numeral. The complex
CL o predicate must then express a change of quantitative state. Either intransitive
subject or transitive direct object undergoes a change of quantitative state.(41) a. ólì òkpòsò híán       ólí úì   ó vbì ódè èvá.
        the woman PRP.cut the rope CL LOC parts two
        ‘The woman cut the rope into two parts.’
     b. ólí úì    híán     ó vbí ódè èvá.
        the rope PRP.cut CL LOC parts two
        ‘The rope got cut into two parts.’Complex CL o predicates also express a reciprocal exchange function. A subject or
direct object argument undergoes exchange relative to a vbi marked argument. In
such cases, the vbi complement (ògèdè, émàè) serves as an exchanged commodity.(42) a. ólí ómòhè háé       ìnáírà èvá ó vbì ògèdè.
        the man PRP.pay naira two CL LOC banana
        ‘The man paid / exchanged two naira for the bananas.’
     b. ólí ómòhè bíá         ó vbí émàè.
        the man PRP.work CL LOC food
        ‘The man worked for food / worked in exchange for food.’For yet another function, complex predicates with CL o vbi o and intransitive stative
verbs express state change. The vbi complement must show the nondeictic locative
pronoun o. The verbs involved denote a physical dimension or physical appearance.
State change predications with o vbì o express scalar, incremental change with no
inherent end point. Most but not all of these predications require Continuous or
Habitual aspect.

toward dissolution of subject referent substance.5(44) éfé     ísì òí ò ó kèré      ò vbì ò.

     ‘His wealth is diminishing.’9.3 Change of state
Change of State (CS) a in its principal function asserts or confirms a telic condition
for a change of material state. It forms complex predicates with verbs that are in-
transitive, transitive or both. CS a distribution in complex transitive predications
reveals eight essential patterns outlined in the following.","[540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556]"
"5.8 Relative pronouns
Relative pronouns serve as head of unmarked relative clauses. ébé'/ébí', émé'/émí'
and ólì/élì occupy head position preceding a relative clause complement. No pro-
nominally headed relative clause shows Relator li, as lexically headed relative
clauses do (Chapter 4, 4.3.3.3). Pronominally headed relative clauses are con-
strained by subcategorization type. Only ólì/élì relatives occur across positions de-
fined by basic grammatical relations.5.8.1 ólì / élì relative clausesRelative pronoun ólì/élì occurs as relative clause head. It shows a number contrast
through initial vowel alternation [o ~ e]. Its final vowel elides, as does that of the
definite article with which it is formally identical (Chapter 4, 4.3.1). The pronoun
ólì/élì agrees in number with a corresponding anaphor in the relative clause: singu-
lar ólí with singular nominative pronoun ó and plural élì with plural nominative
pronoun é.(79) a. ólí ó nwú'        émà lí    òjè, ò fí        áwá údò.
         one he PAP.take yam APP Oje he PRP.hit dog stone
         ‘As for the one who gave yam to Oje, he hit a dog with a stone.’
     b. élí é       nwú'    émà lí    òjè, é     fí'     áwá údò.
        ones they PAP.take yam APP Oje they PAP.hit dog stone
         ‘The ones who gave Oje yam, they hit a dog with a stone.’Relatives signaled by ólì/élì exhibit contrasting reference patterns. Specific refer-
ence is the usual condition, as indicated in the preceding example. Generic refer-
ence, e.g. ‘whoever’ translation, requires Recurrent preverb a in the relative clause.
Singular ólì participates in such constructions, especially when the relative clause
constituent occurs in topic position, whereas élì does not (*élí é á' nwú émà lí òjè, é
fí' ólí áwá údò [ones they PAP.RC take yam APP Oje they PAP.hit the dog stone]
‘Whoever gave yam to Oje, they hit the dog with a stone’).(80) ólí ó á'       nwú émà lí       òjè, ò fí        ólí áwá údò.
     one he PAP.RC take yam APP Oje he PRP.hit the dog stone
     ‘Whoever gave yam to Oje, he hit the dog with a stone.’
270 | Pronouns and conjunction    Relative clauses headed by ólì/élì restrict inflection and auxiliaries, much like
marked relative clauses. They inflect for Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predic-
tive prospective. They fail to inflect for Present perfect, imperfect Continuous or
Anticipative prospective.(81) a. òjè húá        íkpùn ní élí é        kúéé'        ólí ómèmè.

        Oje SC C search.for one he PRED replace him wash plate
        ‘Oje is searching for one who will wash plates instead of him.’ólì/élì relatives reject auxiliaries for epistemic and deontic modality as well as rela-
tive tense, e.g. unacceptable deontic Hortative í (*òjè ò ó hòò ólí ó í kpàyè óì kpé ìtásà
[Oje SC C search one he HOR replace him wash plate] ‘Oje is searching for the one
who should wash plates in his place’), epistemic Deductive za (*òjè ò ó hòò ólí ó zá'
kpáyé óì kpé ìtásà [Oje SC C search one he PAP.DED replace him wash plate] ‘Oje is

PAP.ANT replace him wash plate] ‘Oje is searching for the one who washed plates
instead of him afterward’).
     ólì/élì relative clauses are embedded in various matrix clause grammatical rela-
tions. They appear as matrix subject, possessor (following Associative ísì), direct
object of a simple predicate (záwó ‘see’), direct object of first (rè ‘use’) or second (yé
‘send’) verb in series, first object in a double object complement (following verb
miee ‘receive’), indirect object marked by Applicative li/ni and object complement of
preposition vbi.(82) a. ólí ó rì       vbí áfúzé' kpóón'-ì.

sor, direct object of a simple predicate, direct object of first or second verb in series,
first object in a double object complement, indirect object marked by li/ni and object

     ‘It wasn't the one who came that Oje gave money to.’    In topic position, ólì/élì relatives correspond to subject, possessor, direct object
of simple predicates, direct object of first or second verb in series, first object in
double object complements, indirect object marked by li/ni and object complement
of preposition vbi. In the matrix clause, each of these grammatical relations requires
a resumptive pronoun, as with subject ò, possessor òí, direct objects óì and íyàìn and
nondeictic locative pronoun ò.(85) a. ólí ó rì        vbí áfúzé', ó kpóón'-ì.

       one it PAP.be LOC side road          she PRP.run enter LOC it
       ‘As for the one on the road side, she ran into it.’    Within ólì/élì clauses, a full range of grammatical relations relativize. Subject,
possessor and first object grammatical relations relativize, each of which requires in
the relative complement an anaphor corresponding to ólì/élì. Singular subject
anaphor (ó) corresponds to ólí.(86) òjè ré         ólí ó gbé'-ì              sén    émèlá.
     Oje PRP.take one it PAP.be.blunt-F PRP.stab cow
     ‘Oje used the one that is blunt to stab a cow.’In marked and unmarked associative phrases, ísì marked possessor anaphors (e.g.
òí with low high tone) correspond to ólí. However, in the unmarked instance direct
object anaphors (e.g. óì with high low tone) correspond to ólí.(87) a. ákhé ísì ólí má à tà       étá     ísì òí èdèdé gbé'       à.

        ‘The pot of the one whose offspring was killed broke.’As first object in double object complements, accusative pronouns (e.g. óí) corre-

     Oje PRP.kill one aleke PAP.hit him stone
     ‘Oje killed the one Aleke hit with a stone.’     When grammatical relations other than subject, possessor and first object rela-
tivize, a zero pronoun (with few exceptions) occurs in the corresponding relative
clause position. For example, when a direct object in a monotransitive complement
relativizes, as in direct object position following de ‘buy,’ a zero pronoun occurs in
the relative complement.(89) a. ólí ójé dé'      vbí óbó ísì ólì òkpòsò dé      ré'.

Emai noun phrases show two conjunction types. The Comitative morpheme bíì con-
joins noun phrases. It induces high tone lowering at the left edge of its following
constituent, provided a high high sequence exists, and its final vowel elides. On the
other hand, Correlative conjunction khi precedes each correlated noun phrase.9 Its
final vowel elides and it induces high tone spread in its immediately following noun
phrase as well as high tone lowering at the left edge of each correlated noun phrase.(105) a. éwè bíì      óókhò vá'ré.

phrases. Lexically headed noun phrases joined by bíì are limited by grammatical
number, animacy, syntactic shape, case and discourse features, while pronominally
headed noun phrases are even more restricted.
    Comitative bíì conjoins two or more lexical noun phrases, although each noun
phrase beyond two requires an instance of bíì.(106) éwè bíì óókhò bíì émèlá bíì            èsí   vá'ré.

ferentially restrain pronominal anaphors. Post-bíì anaphors (óí) are obligatory when
co-referring to a noun phrase in focus, topic or antitopic position. Under these con-
ditions, a zero pronoun is unacceptable.(109) a. ònwìmè lí ójé bíì óí gbá'            yé        ìwè.

          ‘He and the farmer together went to the house, that is Oje.’     Noun phrases linked by Comitative bíì restrict agreement regarding animacy,
syntactic shape, and grammatical number. Comitative bíì links names (òlólò bíì òjè
‘Ololo and Oje’), modified nouns (ólí éwè bíì ólí ófè ‘the goat and the rat’) or unmodi-
fied nouns (éwè bíì ófè ‘a goat and a rat’). Comitative bíì links names with modified
nouns (òjè bíì ómóó óí lí ó gbé' ófè [Oje COM friend his R he PAP.kill rat] ‘Oje and his
friend who killed a rat’). Regarding animacy, bíì conjoins animate nouns (ólí éwè bíì
ólí ófè ‘the goat and the rat’) or inanimate nouns (ólí úkpùn bíì ólì òkpàn ‘The cloth
and the gourd’), although human nouns tend to precede nonhuman animate nouns
(ólì òkpòsò bíì ólí áwà ‘the woman and the dog,’ *ólí áwà bíì ólì òkpòsò). However,
Comitative bíì does not conjoin animate and inanimate nouns (*ólì òkpòsò bíì ólí
úkpùn ‘the woman and the cloth’).
     Grammatical number constrains the assignment of pronouns to bíì positions.
Pre-bíì position employs a plural pronoun reflecting the bíì phrase grammatical
relation, although English translation retains a singular or plural interpretation.
Post-bíì position employs an accusative pronoun, irrespective of bíì phrase gram-
matical relation.
     With a bíì phrase as grammatical subject, pre-bíì position takes a plural nomina-
tive pronoun even when the referent is singular.10 Singular nominative pronouns
(e.g. ì ‘I’) are ungrammatical (*ì bíì òjè ‘I and Oje’).(111) mà / vbà / yàn bíì òjè gá             ólì òkpòsò zé.
      we you they COM Oje PRP.meet the woman
      ‘I / You / He and Oje met the woman.’With a bíì phrase as direct object, pre-bíì position requires a plural accusative pro-
noun. The singular direct object form (e.g. mè) is ungrammatical (*mè bíì òjè ‘me

                                                                   Conjunction | 281(112) ólì òkpòsò gá        màì / vbà / íyàìn bíì òjè zé.

     Under these same lexical conditions, a pre-bíì position anaphor never corre-
sponds to an emphatic pronoun in positions of focus (*ìyàìn lí yán bíì ónwímé gbá' yé

     There are additional restrictions on bíì phrases in focus or topic position. In fo-
cus position preceding li/ni, a pre-bíì pronominal must assume an emphatic shape
(màmàì / vbàvbà / ìyàìn bíì òjè ‘we / you / they with Oje’), though not necessarily
plural shape (mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn bíì òjè ‘I / you / he with Oje’). In contrast, a post-
bíì pronominal in a focus position is constrained. It accepts no accusative pronouns
across first, second or third person singular (*òjè bíì mè / è / óì ‘Oje and me / you /
him’) or plural (*òjè bíì màì / vbà / íyàìn ‘Oje with us / you / them’).
     Conjoined bíì phrases in topic position are more constrained. When a bíì phrase
occurs as topic, a pre-bíì pronominal with emphatic shape is disallowed (*ìyàìn bíì
òjè ‘he and Oje’). Likewise, a bíì phrase in topic position disallows a post-bíì pro-
noun, even if it assumes accusative shape (*òjè bíì mè ‘Oje and me’).","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307]"

82 | Morphology     A final class of synthetic compound is formed with verbs in gerundive form. All
retain the morphological shape prefix+verbal+noun. The verbal characterization is
reflected in a common m segment, assumed to be related to gerundive marker -mi.
     Gerundive nominalization normally involves the circumfix ú-VERB-mi. The cir-
cumfix ú-mi converts intransitive and transitive activity verbs as well as change of
state verbs to nominals. Activity verb nominals denote physical conditions where
the gerundive has the interpretation ‘condition characterized by or related to VERB,’
as in únyààmí ‘fussiness of children’ from nyaa ‘pamper, fuss over,’ úyàámì ‘odor’
from yaa ‘smell,’ and úgbèmí ‘pulse, sensation’ from gbe ‘beat.’ Change of state
gerundives denote physical entities or existence states where a condition precedes
or follows verb action, as in úvbìàmí ‘pregnancy’ from vbia ‘to give birth,’ úòmí ‘pus’
from oo ‘discharge pus,’ and úvìénmì ‘line, row’ from vien ‘form a line.’
     Direct object arguments associated with gerundive forms are typically con-
strained by a precedence relation. Direcgt objects precede the gerundive (éhéén
úèmí [fish eating] ‘fish eating’) in, for example, éhéén úèmí zé' mé èmìànmì [fish
eating PAP.cause me illness] ‘Eating fish has made me ill’.
     As for synthetic compounds in class seven, we hypothesize that each includes a
gerundive with a following nominal. The nominal serves a locus function. The ge-
rundives, none of which occurs as a synchronic form except éhìànmì ‘peeling,’ de-
rive from various verbs, not all of which are synchronically viable. In some cases,
the verb can be inferred only from a synchronic form whose morphological shape
has been augmented by a lexically incorporated postverbal particle, e.g. gua by
change of state a, or from an adverb/adjective with a somewhat similar meaning.
The respective gerundive forms and their hypothesized sources are:úgùgúm- ‘ridge of’: from verb gua ‘heap, bring to a raised position’
ógògóm- ‘column of’: from verb gon ‘become bent, crooked’
ábàbàm- ‘side of’: from verb ban ‘expose, reveal a body part’
éhìànm- ‘peeling of’: from verb hian ‘cut’
ìkèkèm- ‘piece of’: from verb ken ‘divide’
úkpá'm- ‘strand of’: from verb kpan ‘peel, flay’
úkpùtúm- ‘stump of’: from adjective kpútú ‘stumpy condition’
úkòm- ‘chunk of’: from verb koo ‘remain, leave behind’
údùdúm- ‘cob of’: from adjective dúgbú ‘short stubby,’ dúkú ‘conical’     Synthetic compounds with condition gerundives refer to items of low functional
utility. They derive from nominals with homogeneous or heterogeneous partitive
composition. Synthetic compounds in class seven isolate a remnant of a body-part
locus, useless remains of an artifact / natural kind, or an inedible portion of food.

verbal -mi reflex. Its only member in our database, ékhàkhà- ‘shavings, crumbs,’
consists of prefix é-, a post-verb noun and verb khakha ‘sieve’ (òjè khákhá ólì ìgáàí
[Oje PRP.sieve the gari] ‘Oje sieved the gari’). Synthetic compounds with an
ékhàkhà- gerundive also refer to items of low functional utility. They isolate remnant
and useless remains of an otherwise consumeable food item.","[107, 108, 109]"

     Complement position preceding a gerundive form is limited to direct object ar-
guments. Even when framed by Locative vbi or Associative ísì, gerundive comple-
ment position rejects a locative adjunct: íwé or vbì ìwè in (*íwé úgbèmí / úgbèmí vbì
ìwè zé ókpósó ghònghòn [house dancing / dancing LOC house PRP.allow woman
be.happy] ‘Dancing in the house made the woman happy’) or subjects, òjè or ísì òjè

PRP.allow village be.happy] ‘The chief's drinking made the village happy’).
     Gerundive phrases are not restricted to core grammatical relations subject and
direct object. They appear as objects of locative preposition vbi.(40) ólí ómòhè béé         vbí émáé úèmí.

exhibit an optional split structure for a limited number of verbs. Intransitive verb
mianme ‘be difficult’ accepts an argument gerundive noun phrase as grammatical
subject. It also shows a split gerundive in which the argument precedes mianme and
the gerundive follows in direct object position. The argument requires obligatory
modification (definite predeterminer ólí). Reversing constituent order is unaccepta-
ble; the gerundive never precedes mianme and its argument never follows (*úhìànmí
ó ò mìànmé órán [cutting SC H be.difficult wood] ‘Cutting wood is difficult’).(42) a. órán úhìànmí ó ò mìànmé.

multiple verb roots that otherwise occur as serial verb sequences or to verb stems
that incorporate a suffix. These lexemes reflect four semantic classes: conditions,
entities, instruments and places.","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"

Relative clauses limit inflection and auxiliary constituents. They inflect for Past

imperfect or Anticipative prospective.(14) a. ómóhé lí ó shén'      émà lí     ònwìmè fí        ólí áwá údò.

        man R he PRED fetch water move.to farmer            PRP.came
        ‘The man who will fetch water for the farmer came.’Relative clauses restrict auxiliary constituents. While they accept epistemic Hypo-
thetical kha, they disallow all epistemic forms (Deductive za, Resultative za, Certain-
tive ma, Dubitative vba and bia, and Concessive rere). Relative clauses also reject
deontic Hortative í.(15) ómóhé lí ó khà      sá     àmè yé          ònwìmè lá        lé'.

ungrammatical.(17) *ómóhé lí ó á'        nwú émà lí      òjè fí       ólí áwá údò.

Grammatical relations that undergo relativization, i.e. that correspond to head noun
of the relative clause, include subject, direct object, indirect object, locative, posses-
sor and adjunct. Of these, subject and possessor require an obligatory resumptive,
                                                                 Determiners | 225personal pronoun in the corresponding relative clause position, as does the first
object in double object complements. Remaining grammatical relations (direct ob-
ject, indirect object, locative and adjunct) show a gap or zero pronoun in the em-
bedded relative clause.
     When relativized, noun phrase positions expressing subject, possessor and first
object in a double object complement require a resumptive pronoun. When a singu-
lar subject constituent relativizes, its position in the embedded relative clause is
marked by an obligatory nominative pronoun (e.g. ó). When a plural subject relativ-
izes, its position requires a plural nominative pronoun (e.g. é). Thus number agree-
ment must obtain between resumptive pronoun and relative clause head (ákhé ~ ó
and ékhé ~ é).(18) a. ákhé ísì ójé lí ó gbé'           á húnmé'   ósèn.
        pot ASS Oje R it PAP.break CS PAP.be.good beauty

        pots ASS Oje R they PAP.break CS PAP.be.good beauty
        ‘Oje's pots which broke were beautiful.’When a possessor constituent following Associative ísì relativizes, its position in the
embedded clause is assumed by a genitive pronoun (e.g. òí). A zero pronoun in the
relativized position is unacceptable.(19) ókpósó lí éghó' ísì òí rì       vbí ùgín shén'      émà.
     woman R money ASS her PRP.be LOC basket PAP.sell yam
     ‘The woman whose money was in the basket sold yam.’When a possessor constituent in an unmarked associative phrase relativizes, its
position in the relative clause is taken by an accusative pronoun (e.g. óí).(20) ómóhé lí érá    óí gbé'       ólí ófè ó           vbì ìwè.
     man R father his PAP.kill the rat PRP.enter LOC house
     ‘The man whose father killed the rat entered the house.’When an external possessor relativizes, i.e. a possessor that precedes its possessum,
its position requires an accusative pronoun (e.g. óí).(21) ókpósó lí ólí ómóhé gbé'      óí ákhè á dé'-ì.
     woman R the man PAP.break her pot CS PAP.fall-F
     ‘The woman whose pot the man broke fell.’
226 | Noun modifiersWhen the first (ókpósó ‘woman’) of two objects in a double object complement (fí ólí
ókpósó údò ‘hit the woman with a stone’) relativizes, its position in the embedded
relative clause requires an accusative pronoun (e.g. óí).(22) òlólò nwú      émà lí    ókpósó lí ójé fí'     óí údò.
     Ololo PRP.take yam APP woman R Oje PAP.hit her stone
     ‘Ololo gave yam to the woman whom Oje hit with a stone.’When the second object (údó) in a double object complement relativizes, a zero
pronoun assumes its position following the first object.(23) òlólò fí          ólí údó lí yán fí'           ólí ókpósó fí à.
     Ololo PRP.throw the stone R they PAP.hit the woman propel CS
     ‘Ololo threw away the stone that they hit the woman with.’     Grammatical relations other than subject, possessor and first object in a double
object complement exhibit a contrasting strategy under relativization. When any of
the relations direct object, indirect object, locative, or adverbial adjunct relativizes,
a zero pronoun occupies its position in the embedded clause. Affected are direct
object positions defined by transitive verbs in simple predicates (ze in ólí ónwímé zé'
ìwè ‘The farmer built a house’), in series (re and ye in ónwímé ré' ólí ómóhé yé ésì òjè
‘A farmer took the man to Oje’s place’), or in construction with a postverbal particle

        house R the man PAP.sell APP farmer PRP.collapse-F
        ‘The house which the man sold to the farmer collapsed.’When indirect object position marked by Applicative li/ni relativizes (ólí ókpósó
nwú' émà lí ólí ómòhè ‘The woman gave yam to the man’; ólí ómóhé shén' ébè lí ólì
òkpòsò ‘The man sold the book to the woman’), it is designated by a zero pronoun.
                                                                  Determiners | 227(25) a. ò nwú         émà lí     ókpósó lí ólí ómóhé shén'  ébè ní.

        he PAP.receive woman R Oje PAP.sell book APP cloth
        ‘He received cloth from a woman whom Oje sold a book to.’When noun phrases serving as locative adjuncts or locative arguments marked by
preposition vbi relativize, their position in the embedded clause is assumed by a
zero pronoun. However, when one relativizes locative adjuncts (e.g. ìwè in ò ó là vbí
ìwè ‘He is running in the house’), the embedded clause obligatorily attracts verb za
in series (Chapter 6. 6.2).(26) íwé lí ó zá'             là gbá-ì.
     house R he PAP.be.loc run PRP.be.big-F
     ‘The house in which he ran was big.’In contrast is the relativization of a locative argument (e.g. ìwè in ó lá ó vbì ìwè ‘He
ran into the house’). When a locative argument relativizes, za is disallowed in series.
As well, neither the relative clause nor its head position retains preposition vbi.(27) íwé    lí ó lá'         ò    gbá-ì.
     house R he PAP.run enter PRP.be.big-F
     ‘The house that he ran into was big.’When a time adjunct (e.g. ólí édè in ólí ómóhé fí' ólí áwá údó vbí ólí édè ‘The man hit
the dog with a stone on the day’) relativizes, its position in the embedded relative
shows a zero pronoun.29(28) édé lí ólí ómóhé fí'        ólí áwá údó ké'           tèè.
     day R the man PAP.hit the dog stone PAP.ANT be.long
     ‘The day when the man hit the dog with a stone was now long past.’4.3.3.4.3     Relative clause and postdeterminers
Lexically headed relative clauses co-occur with all nominal modifier categories,
although forms within categories may be constrained. Relative clauses combine
with definite article ólí/élí under discourse conditions where the speaker wishes to
re-establish shared knowledge with the hearer about the referent of the relativized
nominal. Without a strong discourse condition, speakers tend not to use the definite
article with a relative clause.

     the woman woman R she PAP.kill the rat PRP.run depart
     ‘The woman / A woman who killed the rat ran away.’Relative clauses co-occur with demonstrative modifiers, although distinct order
patterns characterize deictic and contrastive forms. Deictic demonstratives, distal
áìn and proximal nà, follow a relative clause. They do not immediately follow the
head noun and precede the relative clause.(30) a. ólí ókpósó lí ó gbé'       ófé áìn lá      lé'.

        the woman R she PAP.kill rat this PAP.run depart
        ‘This woman who killed a rat ran away.’Contrastive demonstrative nóì, on the other hand, immediately follows either the
head noun or the entire relative clause.(31) a. ókpósó nóí lí ó gbé'        ófè lá        lé'.
        woman next R she PAP.kill rat PRP.run depart

        woman R she PAP.kill rat next PRP.run depart
        ‘The next woman who killed a rat ran away.’Remaining post-nominal modifiers consistently follow the head noun, preceding the
Relator particle and thus the relative clause. li marked relative clauses follow Asso-
ciative ísì complements.(32) íwé     ísì òhí lí ólí ómóhé lá'        ò     gbá-ì.

(e.g. èvèvá), and ordinal numerals (e.g. lí ózèvà) precede a li marked relative clause,
whereas distributive numerals, e.g. èvéèvá do not.(34) a. élí ívbèkhàn èvá lí é      gbé'      ólí ófè váré'.

         the youths    two.each R they PAP.kill rat PRP.come
         ‘The two-two youths who killed rats have come.’Also constrained with relative clause is numeral òkpá ‘one.’ It fails to occur with a
relative clause to modify a head noun.(35) *óvbèkhàn òkpá lí ó gbé'         ólí ófè váré'.
      youth     one R he PAP.kill the rat PRP.come
      ‘One youth who killed the rat came.’Relative clauses are more constrained in combination with quantifiers and kindred
modifiers. Collective universal quantifier èrèmé follows the head noun and precedes
a li marked relative clause. The distributive universal quantifier òdóòdé fails to co-
occur with a relative clause constituent.(36) a. íwé     èrèmé lí ólí ómóhé lá'        ò     gbá-ì.

        woman another R she PAP.buy the cloth PRP.run depart

head noun (N). Six categories are evident: genitive (GEN), adjectival (ADJ), kindred
(KIND), number (NUM), relative clause (RC) and demonstrative (DEM). Relative to
one another, they most often exhibit behavior consistent with Schema A:                      N    GEN ADJ KIND NUM RC DEMA single NP headed by noun íkpùn ‘cloths’ illustrates this schema.íkpún ísì ójé lí óbín' élìyó           èvá lí ónwímé shén-í'       áìn

and following the head noun can be occupied by genitive, adjective, kindred or
number exponents. Reversing the order, e.g. deictic demonstrative preceding geni-
tive or any of the others, is unacceptable.30

who he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case who killed the rat’).
     The remaining construction types, all of which show a discourse defined posi-
tion, exhibit varying degrees of compatibility. Information questions are the most
severely restricted.
     Topic position combines with positive focus, negative focus and direct ques-
tions. It fails with right dislocation. No matter the other construction, the topic con-
stituent appears in leftmost position (*ólí ómòhè lí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man PF the
rat he PAP.kill it] ‘It was the man, as for the rat, who killed it’). When topic and posi-
tive focus position co-occur, topic precedes the li/ni marked focus constituent.(159) a. ólí ófè, ólí ómòhè lí ó gbé'           óì.
         the rat the man PF he PAP.kill it
         ‘As for the rat, it was the man who killed it.’
      b. ólí ómòhè, ólí ófè lí ó gbé'-ì.
         the man       the rat PF it PAP.kill-F
         ‘As for the man, it was the rat he killed.’A single constituent is never referenced in both topic and focus position (*ólí ófè,
íyòìn lí ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [the rat he PF the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for the rat, it was he
who the man killed’).
     When topic and negative focus both occur, topic precedes the negative focus
noun phrase, never the reverse (*ólí ómòhè kí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man NF the rat he
PAP.kill it] ‘It wasn’t the man, as for the rat, who killed it’).(160) ólí ófè, ólí ómòhè kí ó gbé'         óì.
      the rat the man NF he PAP.kill it
      ‘As for the rat, it wasn't the man who killed it.’A single noun phrase is never the referent of topic and negative focus position (*ólí
ófè, íyòìn kí ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [the rat he NF the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for the rat, it
wasn’t he who the man killed’).
     When topic and information question frames co-occur, topic precedes the ques-
tion word (*ébé' ólí ómòhè, ó' yé? [where the man he PAP.move.to] ‘Where, as for the
man, did he move to?’, *émé' ólí ómòhè, ó ré' híán ólí óràn? [what the man he

         the man      what he PAP.use cut the wood
         ‘As for the man, what did he use to cut the wood?’When a topic constituent corresponds to a grammatical relation in an embedded S-
complement of an information question, topic precedes interrogative pronoun
(*émé' ó zé-í' ólí ómòhè, khì ò híán ólí óràn? [what it PAP.cause-F the man IND he
PRP.cut the wood] ‘Why, as for the man, did he cut the wood?’, *émé' ó zé-í' khí ólí

      the man what it PAP.cause-F IND he PRP.cut the wood
      ‘As for the man, why did he cut the wood?’     Topic and right dislocation are incompatible, even when each position corre-
sponds to a distinct grammatical relation in the matrix clause (*ólí ómòhè, ò shén óì,
í khì ólí úkpùn [the man he PRP.sell it ID be the cloth] ‘As for the man, he sold it, that
is the cloth’).
     Positive focus shows extremely limited compatibility with other construction
types. It co-occurs with topic, as already indicated, and right dislocation but not
with negative focus and information questions.
     Positive focus and right dislocation are compatible, although crossover of
grammatical relations constrains grammatical acceptability. When matrix grammat-
ical subject corresponds to positive focus, matrix direct object in a monotransitive
complement can correspond to a right dislocated constituent. However, a direct
object in a monotransitive complement that corresponds to a focus position noun
phrase never co-occurs with a subject that corresponds to a constituent in RD posi-
tion (*ólí úkpùn lí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the cloth PF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man]
‘It was the cloth that he sold, that is the man’, *ólí ófè lí ó gbé'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the

         ‘It was the man who killed it, that is the rat.’   Positive focus never co-occurs with information questions. Even when distinct
grammatical relations are affected, focus and direct question are incompatible

that it was the man who moved?’, *ólí ómòhè lí ébé' ó yé'-ì? [the man PF where he
PAP.move.to-F] ‘It was the man who to where did he move?’).
     Negative focus also shows limited co-occurrence with other construction types.
It appears with topic, as already seen, and right dislocation, but not with positive
focus or direct questions. Negative focus and right dislocation are compatible, alt-
hough crossover of grammatical relations in the matrix clause limits combinations.
Subject corresponds to a constituent in negative focus position when a direct object
corresponds to right dislocated position.(164) a. ólí ómòhè kí ó shén'          óì, í khì ólí úkpùn.
         the man NF he PAP.sell it ID be the cloth

         the man NF he PAP.kill it ID be the rat
         ‘It was the man who killed it, that is the rat.’But a direct object that corresponds to negative focus position never co-occurs with
a subject that corresponds to right dislocated position (*ólí úkpùn kí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí
ómòhè [the cloth NF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man] ‘It wasn’t the cloth that he sold,
that is the man’, *ólí ófè kí ó gbé'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the rat NF he PAP.kill-F ID be the
man] ‘It wasn’t the rat that he killed, that is the man’).
     Negative focus never co-occurs with information questions. Even with distinct
grammatical relations affected, NF and questions are incompatible (*ébé' ólí ómòhè

go to?’, *ólí ómòhè kí ébé' ó yé'-ì? [the man NF where he PAP.move.to-F] ‘It wasn’t
the man so where did he move to?’).
     As indicated previously, right dislocation co-occurs with positive focus, nega-
tive focus and with information questions. It never combines with topicalization. RD
and information questions are compatible provided distinct matrix relations are
involved. Moreover, crossover of subject to right dislocated position and direct ob-
ject to question position is acceptable.(165) émé' ó shén'-ì,       í khì ólí ómòhè?
      what he PAP.sell-F ID be the man
      ‘What did he sell, that is the man?’In addition, the constraint limiting RD to subject or direct object does not apply
under a question condition. Indirect objects marked by Applicative li/ni appear in
RD position with question words corresponding to subject or direct object.

8 Be, do, happen and have
Emai employs several copula forms to articulate grammatical functions associated
with English ‘be’ as well as various verbs to convey ‘do,’ ‘happen’ and ‘have.’ Al-
though the phonological form expressing some functions of ‘be,’ ‘do,’ and ‘happen,’
respectively, are identical, their tonal behavior and grammatical properties are dis-
tinct. The form expressing ‘have’ shows no phonological similarity to either ‘be’ or
‘do’ forms. A residual set of verb forms expressing meanings related to ‘resemble’
and ‘seem’ occupy final sections of this chapter.8.1 ‘be’ forms
Emai employs five ‘be’ forms. Two allow a speaker to re-align a referent with respect
to presumed discourse knowledge of the hearer. One form specifies referent identity
for the addressee (óò), and another equates one referent to another (khi). Remaining
‘be’ forms convey predication, assigning a referent to either a nominal class (vbi/u),
property (u) or location (ri/e).(1) a. óáìn         lí í khì àgbògbòràn.

       the youth         PRP.be LOC house
       ‘The youth is in the house.’Each ‘be’ form defines a construction with distinct grammatical behavior.1 Construc-
tion properties are assessed relative to mood and polarity, verb suffixes and inflec-
tion, in addition to auxiliary, preverb and postverbal categories. Noun phrase posi-
tions associated with ‘be’ forms are assessed with regard to NP type, animacy,
syntactic shape and repositioning in discourse.
424 | Be, do, happen and have8.1.1 Equational identity khiA relation of Equational Identity (EID) between two noun phrase referents is con-
veyed by copula khi. One noun phrase is positioned immediately following khi and
the other occurs in focus position marked by either positive focus li/ni or negative
focus ki. The subject position preceding khi requires the Identity subject pronoun i.(2) a. ólí ómóhé nà lí í khì ònwìmè.
       the man this PF ID be farmer
       ‘It is this man who is a farmer.’
    b. ólí ómóhé nà kí í khì ònwìmè.
       the man this NF ID be farmer
       ‘It isn't this man who is a farmer.’Each noun phrase position associated with khi is syntactically restricted. khi subject
requires Identity pronoun í. It rejects nominative pronouns (e.g. o) or the indefinite
subject pronoun (a).(3) ólí ómòhè lí í / *ó / *á khì ònwìmè.
    the man PF ID he one be farmer
    ‘It is the man who is a farmer.’Subject aside, noun phrase positions framed by Equational Identity khi require
number agreement. The focus position constituent and the post-khi constituent
must show equivalent number value (*élí íkpún lí ébín' lí í khì óáìn [the cloths R dark
PF ID be that.one] ‘That one is dark cloths’).(4) élí íkpún lí ébín' lí í khì éáìn.
    the cloth R dark PF ID be those.ones
    ‘Those are the dark cloths.’    The EID copula accepts few affixal, auxiliary, preverb or post-verbal forms nor-
mally associated with Emai verbs. khi constructions evince a predicate phrase with
nonfixed tone: low tone (khì) with bare predicate phrase, i.e. absence of inflectional,
auxiliary or preverb categories, but high tone (khí) when preceded by an auxiliary or
preverb, such as epistemic Certaintive ma.(5) a. èkpèn lí í khì ójé ísì éànmì.
       leopard PF ID be chief ASS animal
       ‘It is the leopard who is chief of the animals./The animal chief is the leopard.’
                                                                      ‘be’ forms | 425b.   èkpèn lí í mà khí ójé ísì éànmì.
     leopard PF ID CER be chief ASS animal
     ‘It is the leopard who is certainly chief of the animals.’
     ‘The chief of the animals is certainly the leopard.’     The EID copula rejects affixes typically associated with verbs. It disallows the
Perseverative prefix Ci-, Distributive suffix -lo/lo/no and Factative suffix -i. Relative
to inflection, khi constructions do not inflect for perfect, imperfect or prospective
aspect. EID constructions also limit auxiliaries. While incompatible with deontic
Hortative í, they allow epistemic Certaintive ma (òhí lí í mà khí óbá' [Ohi PF ID CER
be Oba] ‘It is ohi who surely is the King / Oba’), Dubitatives vba (òhí lí í vbà khí óbá'?
[Ohi PF ID DUB be Oba] ‘Could Ohi really be the King / Oba?’) and bia (òhí lí í bìà khí
óbá'?[Ohi PF ID DUB be Oba] ‘Is Ohi actually the King / Oba?’) as well as Concessive
rere (òhí lí í rèrè khí óbá'? [Ohi PF ID CONC be Oba] ‘So is it Ohi who is even the King
/ Oba?’). Unacceptable are epistemic Deductive za, Resultative za and Hypothetical
kha.
     EID khi is not as selective regarding relative tense. It admits Anterior ke (èkpèn lí
í kè khí ójé ísì éànmì [leopard PF ID ANT be chief ASS animal] ‘It is the leopard who
has been chief of the animals since then / The chief of the animals since then is the
leopard’) and Subsequent kpe (èkpèn lí í kpè khí ójé ísì éànmì? [leopard PF ID SUB be
chief ASS animal] ‘Is the chief of the animals still the leopard?’).
     As for preverbs, a few event-directed preverbs are grammatical in EID construc-
tions. Participant-directed preverbs, though, are disallowed (Chapter 3, 3.2.8 for
preverb types). khi constructions admit only kuku from the evaluative class (òhí lí í
kùkù khí óbá' [Ohi PF ID POEV be Oba] ‘Ohi is afterall the King / Oba’) and kpao from
the temporal class (èkpèn lí í kpàò khí ójé ísì éànmì [leopard PF ID earlier be chief
ASS animal]‘The chief of the animals initially was the leopard’).
     Negative focus and interrogative mood establish conditions for aspectualizer
preverbs Additive gbo (òhí kí í gbò khí óbá'? [Ohi NF ID ADD be Oba] ‘Isn't it also Ohi
who is King / Oba?’) and Durative se (òhí kí í sè khí óbá'? [Ohi NF ID DUR be Oba]
‘Isn't it still Ohi who is King / Oba?’). No other aspectualizers occur with EID khi,
irrespective of mood or focus type. Of preverbs remaining, manner-demonstrative,
subject attributive and quantity, none is grammatical in a khi construction.
     The EID copula is highly restricted Relative to postverbal complement particles
and adverbs. It disallows postverbal Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree
gbe (*ólí ómòhè lí í khì ònwìmè léé / gbé [the man PF ID be farmer TEMP /much] ‘It is
the man who already is a farmer / too much of a farmer’). Likewise, khi construc-
tions reject temporal deictic adverbs, e.g. èghéènà ‘just recently’ (*ólí ómòhè lí í khì
ónwímé èghéènà [the man PF ID be farmer recently] ‘It was the man who was a
farmer recently’).2
426 | Be, do, happen and have     Copula khi restricts polarity and mood. It appears as a polar question. But it re-
jects Perfect Negation (*ólí ómóhé nà lí í ì khì ònwìmè [the man this PF ID NEG be
farmer] ‘It is not this man who is a farmer’), allowing only negative focus ki. Con-
cerning mood, khi constructions never appear as imperatives or prohibitives.(6) a. ólí ómóhé nà lí í khì ònwìmè?

       ‘Is this man a farmer?’
    b. ólí ómóhé nà kí í khì ònwìmè.
       the man this NF ID be farmer
       ‘It isn't this man who is a farmer.’    EID khi noun phrase positions exhibit contrasting grammatical properties. They
constrain NP type (pronoun < proper noun < common noun), definiteness (definite <
indefinite) and animacy (human < animate < inanimate). Regarding NP type, li/ni
focus position takes emphatic personal pronouns; nonemphatic nominative pro-
nouns are unacceptable.(7) mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn lí í khì ònwìmè.
    I           you     he   PF ID be farmer
    ‘It is I / you / he who am / are / is a farmer.’Focus position accepts most impersonal pronouns. It even accepts numeral headed
partitive phrases (èvá vbì ò lí í khì ìgbégbè [two LOC it PF ID be velvet] ‘It is two of
them that are velvet’). However, EID focus position disallows the partitive existen-
tial quantifier pronoun ósò (*ósò lí í khì ísì èmé [one PF ID be ASS my] ‘It is a certain
one that is mine’).
     Focus position in khi constructions allows proper nouns and common nouns.
Proper nouns accept emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone.’(8) òjè (òkpá) lí í khì óì.
    Oje alone PF ID be thief
    ‘It is Oje (alone) who is a thief.’Regardless of their human (ómòhè), animate (èkpèn) or inanimate (ìgbégbè) charac-
ter, bare common nouns appear in khi’s focus position.(9)   a. ómòhè lí í khì óbá' ísì èdó.

     c. ìgbégbè lí í khì èrèmé.
        velvet PF ID be all
        ‘All are velvet.’In khi’s focus position constituent, common nouns take an optional definite prede-
terminer ((ólì) èkpà lí í khì ísì òjè [the bag PF ID be ASS Oje] ‘It is a / the bag which is
Oje's’). But they reject partitive existential quantifier ósò (*ómóhé ósò lí í khì óbá' ísì
èdó [man certain PF ID be Oba ASS Edo] ‘It is a certain man who is the Oba of Be-
nin’).
    Post-khi position is more restrained with regard to NP type and definiteness but
not animacy. It allows no personal pronouns, particularly those for accusative (óì).
Equally unacceptable are nominative (ò) and emphatic (ìyòìn) pronouns.(10) *ólì ònwìmè lí í khì óì / ò / ìyòìn.
      the farmer PF ID be him he he
      ‘It is a farmer that is he.’Post-copula position limits impersonal pronouns. It admits those that are definite or
construed as definite. Demonstrative òáìn (ólí ómòhè lí í khì óáìn [the man PF ID be
that.one] ‘That is the man’) and universal quantifying èrèmé (ìgbégbè lí í khì èrèmé
[velvet PF ID be all] ‘All are velvet’) occur. Post-copula position disallows partitive
existential pronoun ósò (*ìgbégbè lí í khì ósò [velvet PF ID be certain.one] ‘Some
thing is velvet’).
    Post-khi position also rejects numeral pronouns. èvá is representative alone
(*ìgbégbè lí í khì èvá [velvet PF ID be two] ‘Two are velvet’) or as partitive vbi phrase
head (*ìgbégbè lí í khì èvá vbì ò [velvet PF ID be two LOC it] ‘Two of them are velvet’).

partitive òkpá.(11) ódón     mè lí í khì òlólò (*òkpá).

     ‘My husband is Ololo.’Post-khi position also allows common nouns: human (óvbékhán), animate

clause with Relator li or an associative phrase with ísì.

restricted. This position rejects partitive existential ósò (*àzén lí í khì ómóhé ósò
[wizard PF ID be man certain] ‘Some man is a wizard’). When a common noun (e.g.
èkpà ‘bag’) can be semantically construed as head of an overtly headless associative
phrase in focus position (ísì òjè), post-copula position requires the definite article
(ólì èkpà). Post-khi position under this condition does not accept bare common
nouns.(13) ísì òjè lí í khì ólì èkpà /*èkpà.
     ASS Oje PF ID be the bag    bag

tioning. Focus position noun phrases cannot be replaced by a topic noun phrase
(*ódón óì, í khì òlólò [husband her ID be Ololo] ‘As for her husband, he is Ololo’). As
well, an emphatic pronoun in khi’s focus position cannot co-refer to topic (*ódón óì,
ìyòìn lí í khì òlólò [husband her he PF ID be Ololo] ‘As for her husband, it is he who is
Ololo’).(14) ódón        óì lí í khì òlólò.

(*òlólò lí ódón óì lí í khì óáìn [Ololo PF husband her PF ID be that.one] ‘It is Ololo

     Noun phrase positions linked by khi exhibit distinct interrogative pronouns.
Post-khi position rejects interrogative pronouns, particularly an echo question pro-
noun (*ódón óì lí í khì óèé'? [husband her PF ID be who] ‘Her husband is who?’).

     ‘Woodpecker.’     ‘It is a woodpecker.’8.1.2 Specifier oThe Specifier copula (SPE) construction identifies a referent for a hearer. It exhibits
a rather rigid syntax. SPE constructions consist of Specifier copula o preceded by a
noun phrase in a focus position that is either overtly marked by negative focus ki or
covertly marked for positive focus. SPE rejects overt marking of positive focus by
li/ni. In its canonical shape, the Specifier copula shows a high low tone.(17) óì     kí óò.         / óì (*lí) óò.
     thief NF be             thief PF be
     ‘It isn't a thief.’     ‘It’s a thief.’    SPE constructions show no grammatical subject. Nominative pronouns are not
allowed either in place of initial high tone, as one might expect if the initial high
tone o were the third person nominative pronoun (*ólí ómòhè ó ò [the man he be]
430 | Be, do, happen and have‘He is a man’), or in construction with high low tone of copula óò (*ólí ómòhè í / ú óò
[the man I you be] ‘I am / you are the man’).
     SPE frames exhibit few grammatical properties typically associated with verb
constructions. óò does not inflect for aspect, at least in the usual Emai fashion. Alt-
hough the bare SPE copula shows high low tone, it disallows aspect marking as
perfect (neither Past nor Present), imperfect (neither Continuous nor Habitual) or
prospective (neither Predictive nor Anticipative).
     Constructions with óò restrict verbal affixes, auxiliaries, preverbs, postverbal
particles and temporal deictic adverbs. Relative to verbal affixes, SPE is incompati-
ble with Perseverative prefix Ci-, Distributive suffix lo/lo/no and Factative suffix -i.
     SPE copula tone is uniformly low when preceded by a modal auxiliary. And SPE
is never compatible with a subject pronoun (ó ) preceding an auxiliary.(18) íkhúnmí ékpà má ò.            /   *íkhúnmí ékpà ó má' ò.
     medicine vomit CER be               medicine vomit it CER be
     ‘It is vomit medicine.’     SPE constructions restrict auxiliaries, except for epistemic forms, and preverbs.
Relative tense ke and kpe are unacceptable as is deontic Hortative í. SPE allows
epistemic Certaintive ma, as shown above, Dubitative vba (óì vbá ò? [thief DUB be]
‘Could it really be a thief?’) and bia (íkhúnmí ékpà bíá ò? [medicine vomit DUB be]
‘Was it actually vomit medicine?’), and Concessive rere (óì rérè ó? [thief CONC be]
‘So it was even a thief?’). Of these, only Certaintive does not require a polar ques-
tion. SPE disallows Deductive za, Resultative za and Hypothetical kha.
     Specifier copula constructions limit preverbs absolutely. They reject aspectual-
izer gbo, evaluative kuku, temporal kpao and manner-demonstrative ìyó as repre-
sentatives of their category (*óì gbó / kúkù / kpáò / ìyó ò [thief ADD POEV initially
DMD be] ‘It’s also / after all / firstly / so a thief’). In addition, they reject subject
attributive and quantity preverbs
     SPE similarly constrains post-verbal complement particles and adverbials. It
disallows Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*óì óò léé / gbé [thief
be TEMP much] ‘He’s already too much a thief’). It also prohibits temporal deictic
adverbs such as éénà ‘today’ (*óì óò éènà [thief be today] ‘It’s a thief today’).
     SPE óò constructions severely limit polarity and mood. They show an interroga-
tive form with high high tone on the copula (óì óó? [thief be] ‘Is it a thief?’, óì kí óó?
[thief NF be] ‘Isn't it a thief?’). However, óò constructions do not assume an impera-
tive, prohibitive or negative statement shape.
     Specifier óò partially restricts its initial noun phrase position, i.e focus, as to NP
type, animacy and definiteness.4 For NP type, Specifier focus requires an emphatic
pronoun, irrespective of person or number. It rejects nonemphatic nominative pro-
nouns (i, u) or the indefinite subject pronoun (a).
                                                                          ‘be’ forms | 431(19) mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn óò.
     I           you     he be
     ‘It is I / you / he.’     SPE initial position allows impersonal pronouns. These include demonstrative
(óáìn, ònà, ónóì), partitive (ósò) and contrastive (óvbèé) existential quantifier, deictic
(élìyó) and contrastive (ódàn) kindred, as well as numeral pronouns, cardinal (èvá)
or collective (èvèvá), as in (óáìn / óvbèé /ósò óò [that.one another certain.one be] ‘It
is that one / another one / a certain one’). Universal quantifier pronouns differ as to
grammaticality: collective èrèmé occurs whereas distributive òdóòdé does not.(20) èrèmé / *òdóòdé       óò.
     all          each.one be
      ‘It’s all.’     SPE focus allows proper and common nouns. It permits proper nouns of person
(òhí) and place (áfúzé') but disallows proper nouns with emphatic òkpá ‘alone.’(21) òhí (*òkpá) óò.         /    áfúzé' óò.
     Ohi alone be                 Afuze be
     ‘It is Ohi.’                 ‘It is Afuze.’    Common nouns, regardless of human (ómò), animate (áwà) or inanimate (ìtébù)
nature, appear in SPE focus position and do so with an optional definite article.(22) (ólí) ómò óò.            /   (ólí) áwà óò.        /   (ólì) ìtébù óò.
      the infant be                the dog be               the table be
      ‘It’s an / the infant.’      ‘It’s a / the dog.’      ‘It’s a / the table.’     In its focus position SPE admits various postdeterminers. Besides numerals
(èvá) and kindred forms (élìyó), it allows demonstratives like áìn (ólì ìtébú áìn óò [the
table that be] ‘It’s that table’) and existential quantifiers like ósò (ómóhé ósò óò [man
certain be] ‘It is a certain man’. Relative to universal quantifiers, SPE focus accepts
collective èrèmé but not distributive òdóòdé (ívbékhán èrèmé / *òdóòdé óò [youths
all each be] ‘It’s all the youths’).
     Noun phrases in SPE constructions disallow further repositioning in discourse.
They disallow a noun phrase in topic position with a corresponding pronominal
anaphor in focus position (*ólí ómòhè, ìyòìn óò [the man he be] ‘As for the man, it is
he’). As well, SPE óò does not accept interrogative pronouns such as émé', óé', ékà
(*émé' / óé' / ékà óò? [what who how.much be] ‘What / Who / How much is it?’).
432 | Be, do, happen and have    Although SPE constructions with óò answer a wide range of information ques-
tions,5 they do not appear as information questions. Instead, an u form, found in
property copula and class membership copula constructions, shapes information
questions for which SPE constructions serve as responses. Information questions
with u accept interrogative pronouns for person (óé'), object (émé') and quantity
(éká) but not place (ébé').(23) óé' ó ú'?     /       émé' ó ú'?           /    éká           ó ú'?

     ‘It’s Oje.’           ‘It’s a cutlass.’          ‘It’s four naira.’     The entire SPE construction in complex topic-comment structures designates a
comment relative to a preceding topic constituent (e.g. ólí ómòhè). Although the SPE
construction follows a noun phrase in topic position, the topic noun phrase corre-
sponds to no pronoun marked for a grammatical relation in the SPE construction, as
is the case in simple topic constructions.(24) ólí ómòhè, òjè óò.
     the man      chief be
     ‘As for the man, he’s the traditional ruler.’SPE constructions also serve as comment for a morphosyntactically heavy topic that
is extraposed and marked by indicative complement khi. The entire topic comment
configuration shows only a polar interrogative mood.(25) àtà óó khì òjè gbé               ákhè á?

     ‘Is it true that Oje broke a pot?’8.1.3 Nominal class membership vbi / uThe complementary copula forms vbi and u articulate class membership (CMB).
They assign a referent to a nominal class. Canonical CMB constructions define two
noun phrase positions: the assigned nominal precedes the class nominal with the
copula interposed. The overall syntactic shape of CMB constructions is constrained,
particularly with respect to noun phrase composition and copula verbal properties.
                                                                      ‘be’ forms | 433    CMB constructions rarely exhibit a canonical simple active, affirmative frame.
Instead, they show either Perfect Negation preceding copula vbi or a class noun in a
discourse defined position such as focus (marked by li/ni) followed by the assigned
nominal and copula u.(26) a. ólí ómòhè í ì            vbì óì.
        the man SC NEG be thief
        ‘The man is not a thief.’
     b. óì      lí ólí ómóhé ú'.
        thief PF the man PAP.be
        ‘It is a thief that the man is.’Despite their class membership function, CMB constructions never frame taxonomic
statements in which one referent is ranked relative to another using a specific to
general scale, respectively.(27) *èkpèn / ólì èkpèn         vbì éàmì.
      leopard the leopard be animal
      ‘A / The leopard is an animal.’    As previously indicated, CMB constructions limit polarity and mood. Negative
polarity is the norm. Under extremely rich contextual conditions but never at the
onset of a discourse, affirmative CMB constructions occur. When they do, vbi tone is
obligatorily low.(28) ólí ómòhè vbì óì.
     the man be thief
     ‘The man is a thief.’     CMB constructions partially limit mood expression. They appear as polar ques-
tions with Perfect Negation (ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óì? [the man SC NEG be thief] ‘Isn't the
man a thief?’) and focus (óì lí ólí ómóhé ù? [thief PF the man be] ‘Is it a thief that the
man is?’). CMB does not occur as an imperative or prohibitive.
     CMB accepts few forms prototypically associated with Emai verb phrases. It lim-
its verbal affixes, inflection, auxiliaries, preverbs, post-verbal particles and tem-
poral deictic adjuncts. Although CMB prefers negation, it does not inflect for perfect,
imperfect or prospective aspect. Likewise, it rejects verbal affixes, such as Distribu-
tive lo/lo/no (*élí ímòhè í ì vbì-lò óì [the men SC NEG be-DS thief] ‘Each of the men is
not a thief’).
     Similarly, CMB frames restrict auxiliaries and preverbs. They disallow modality,
both deontic (Hortative í) and epistemic (Certaintive ma), as well as relative tense,
434 | Be, do, happen and haveAnterior ke in (*ólí ómòhè í ì í / má / ké vbì óì [the man SC NEG HOR CER ANT be
thief] ‘The man should not be/ is surely not / is not since then a thief’). Under spe-
cial usage conditions involving fixed metaphor, the vbi copula occurs with Anterior
relative tense ke (áwé ísì òí í ì ké vbì égbé ísì òí [legs ASS her SC NEG ANT be body
ASS her] ‘Her legs do not feel part of her body anymore’).
     CMB constructions allow only one preverb. They accept evaluative preverb kuku
(ólí úkpùn í ì kùkú vbì ísì òjè [the cloth SC NEG POEV be ASS Oje] ‘Afterall, the cloth is
not Oje's’). Remaining preverb classes are rejected, namely aspectualizer (Additive
gbo), subject attributive (totóbo), temporal (kpao), manner-demonstrative (ìyó) and
quantity (gba): (*élí ímòhè í ì gbó / tòtóbó / kpàó / ìyó / gbá vbì óì [the men SC NEG
ADD / intensely /initially / DMD /COL be thief] ‘The men are not also / intensely /
initially / that way / together thieves’).
     CMB also restricts postverbal temporal particles and adverbs. It rejects Tem-
poral Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óí lèé / gbè [the
man SC NEG be thief TEMP / much] ‘The man is not a thief already / too much of a
thief’). It disallows deictic adjuncts, e.g. èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óí
èghéènà [the man SC NEG be thief recently] ‘The man was not a thief recently’).
     Noun phrase positions in CBM constructions are restricted by NP type and defi-
niteness but not animacy or number. Assigned nominals preceding the CMB copula
allow all NP types and all definiteness values. The class nominal following vbi/u
accepts only common nouns and only referential indefinites. Across assigned nomi-
nal and class nominal positions, number agreement is obligatory (ólí ómòhè and
ònwìmè, élí ímòhè and ìnwìmè).(29) a. ólí ómòhè / *élí ímòhè í ì   vbì ònwìmè.
        the man       the men SC NEG be farmer

        the men      the man SC NEG be farmers
       ‘The men are not farmers.’Class nominal position following vbi/u allows common nouns that are human

       the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass
       ‘The heavy one is not a cutlass.’Some common nouns appear in CMB class position only when syntactically elabo-
rated. Abstract nouns like èmòì ‘fault’ require a possessive modifier.(31) ó ì        vbì émóí mè / *èmòì.
     it NEG be fault my        fault
     ‘It is not my fault.’Class nominal position following CMB disallows proper names and personal pro-
nouns, particularly nominative (ò) or accusative (óì) pronouns.(32) *ólí óbò       í   ì     vbì òlólò / ò / óì.
      the oraclist SC NEG be Ololo he him
      ‘The oraclist is not Ololo / he / him.’     Class nominal position constrains definiteness expression. Common nouns with
definite article ólí/élí are unacceptable (ónóì í ì vbì ómò / *ólí ómò [next.one SC NEG
be child the child] ‘The next one is not a useless child’), as are attributive phrase
descriptions marked by the same modifier (*ólí ékpé' í ì vbì ólí óbín' [the hawk SC
NEG be the dark.one] ‘The hawk is not the dark one’).
     Class position with vbi/u disallows the entire range of postdeterminers. Unac-
ceptable modifiers in class position include kindred élìyó and demonstrative nóì
(*ólí òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá élìyó / nóì [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass that.kind / next]
‘The heavy one is not that kind of cutlass’), universal quantifier èrèmé and cardinal
numeral èvá (*élì òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá èrèmé / èvá [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass all
two] ‘The heavy ones are not all the / the two cutlasses’) as well as existential quan-
tifier ósò (*ólí òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá ósò [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass some] ‘The
heavy one is not some cutlass’).
     However, CMB class position takes common nouns modified by Associative ísì
phrases. It does so provided there is no definite article (ólì òkhùà í ì vbì ópíá ísì òjè
/*ólí ópíá ísì òjè [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass ASS Oje the cutlass ASS Oje] ‘The
heavy one is not Oje's cutlass’). It also accepts headless associative phrases (ólì
òkhùà í ì vbì ísì òjè [the heavy.one SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The heavy one is not Oje's’).
     CMB class position accepts few impersonal pronouns. It allows the numeral
pronoun úkpòkpá ‘one’ as head of a partitive vbi phrase whose complement is a
pronominally headed relative clause. A numeral pronoun greater than one (e.g. èvá)
as head of a partitive phrase is unacceptable (*élí ópíá nà í ì vbì èvá vbí élí á ló shèn-
nò [the cutlass these SC NEG be two LOC ones one PRED sell-DS] ‘These cutlasses are
436 | Be, do, happen and havenot two of the ones that will be sold’). All other impersonal pronouns are rejected:
demonstrative, universal and existential quantifier, kindred and collective numeral.(33) ólí ópíá nà í ì             vbì úkpòkpá vbí élí á ló         shèn.
     the cutlass this SC NEG be one             LOC ones one PRED sell
      ‘This cutlass is not one of the ones that will be sold.’    Assigned position preceding the CMB copula exhibits contrasting values as to
NP type and definiteness but not animacy. Regarding NP type, it accepts proper
names (òlólò) and subject position pronouns (má, yán) but not the indefinite subject
pronoun (a).(34) a. òlólò í ì        vbì óì.
        Ololo SC NEG be thief

     b. má / yán / *á        ì   vbì óì.
        we they one NEG be thief
        ‘We / they are not thieves.’    Assigned position in vbi/u constructions accepts common nouns regardless of
animacy. They must, however, be syntactically elaborated.7 Assigned position per-
mits human (òkpòsò), nonhuman animate (áwá) and inanimate (ópìà) nouns, pro-
vided each is elaborated by, for example, definite article ólì.(35) a. ólì òkpòsò / *òkpòsò í ì            vbì óèjè.

The noun úkhùè ‘curse’ in assigned position disallows the definite predeterminer
and any other modifier.(36) úkhùè / *ólí úkhùè / *úkhùè lí òdè        í ì    vbì émí lì èsèn.

predeterminer. Common nouns occur in assigned position when modified only by a
collective numeral, e.g. èvèvá in (ímóhé èvèvá í ì vbì ìnwìmè [men both SC NEG be
farmers] ‘Both men are not farmers’). Assigned position common nouns do not re-
quire the definite article when modified by Associative ísì (ólí áwà / áwá ísì òjè í ì vbì
áànmì [the dog dog ASS Oje SC NEG be female] ‘The dog of Oje / Oje’s dog is not
female’) or Relator li relative clause (ólí ópíá / ópíá lí ólí ómóhé nwú' fì á í ì vbì ísì òjè
[the cutlass cutlass R the man take propel CS SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The / A cutlass
that the man threw away was not Oje's’).
      Other modifiers that affect referent construal appear in assigned position. These
include postdeterminer demonstratives nà and nóì (ólí ópíá nà / ópíá nóì í ì vbì ólí á
ré' gbé ólí éwè [the cutlass this cutlass next SC NEG be one one use kill the goat]
‘This cutlass / The next cutlass is not the one used to kill the goat’).
      More constrained in assigned position are cardinal numerals and quantifier
postdeterminers. Cardinal numerals require the definite predeterminer (élí ópìà èvá
/ *ópìà èvá í ì vbì ísì òjè [the cutlass two cutlass two SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The two
cutlasses are not Oje's’) or a complement consisting of a partitive vbi phrase (ópìà
èvá vbì ò í ì vbì ísì òjè [cutlass two LOC it SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘Two cutlasses from
them were not Oje's’).
      Assigned position rejects quantifier and kindred forms. Excluded are existential
quantifiers ósò and óvbèé (*ópíá ósò / óvbèé í ì vbì ísì òjè [cutlass some other SC NEG
be ASS Oje] ‘Some / Another cutlass is not Oje’s’) and kindred élìyó (*ópíá élìyó í ì vbì
ísì òjè [cutlass that.kind SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘A cutlass of that kind is not Oje's’).
      Impersonal pronouns in assigned position are partially restricted. Acceptable
are demonstrative ònà and ónóì (ònà / ónóì í ì vbì ísì èé [this.one next.one SC NEG be
ASS your] ‘This one / the next one is not yours’) as well as plural existential ésò (ésò
í ì vbì ísì èmé [some.ones SC NEG be ASS my] ‘None are mine’).
      In assigned position, numeral pronouns reveal a mixed distribution. Collective
numeral pronouns (èvèvá) are acceptable (èvèvá í ì vbì ísì èmé [all.two SC NEG be
ASS my] ‘Both are not mine’), whereas cardinal numeral pronouns (èvá, òkpá) re-
quire a following partitive vbi phrase (èvá vbí élì ògèdè / *èvá í ì vbì ísì èmé [two LOC
the banana two SC NEG be ASS my] ‘Two of the bananas are not mine’). Morphologi-
cal reformulation is also required for òkpá ‘one,’ e.g. úkpòkpá (úkpòkpá vbí élí á ló
shèn í ì vbì ísì òjè [one LOC ones one PRED sell SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘One of those that
will be sold is not Oje’s’).
      Nonetheless, assigned position reveals the unacceptability of remaining pro-
nouns. Kindred forms fail, deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn (*élìyó í ì vbì ísì òjè
[that.kind SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘That kind of one is not Oje’s’), as does the contrastive
existential pronoun óvbèé (*óvbèé í ì vbì ísì òjè [other.one SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘An-
other one is not Oje’s’).
438 | Be, do, happen and have    Nominal constituents in CMB constructions partially constrain discourse reposi-
tioning. Assigned position corresponds to a constituent in li/ni focus position or in

Moreover, only when the interrogative contains a vbi phrase with partitive signifi-
cance (vbí úsèé vbá) is the assigned position queried (*óé' ó ì vbì óì? [who he NEG be

     ‘Telling lies is not a good thing.’8.1.4 Property uThe copula form u assigns a nominal referent to a property. u occurs in construction
with a preceding noun phrase and a following adjective or property noun. Although
the position preceding u manifests characteristics typical of grammatical subject,
and the property term consists primarily of adjectives,8 the property construction
(PRY) attracts relatively few features prototypically associated with verb phrases.(42) ólí ómòhè ú        négénégén.
     the man PRP.be wiry
     ‘The man is wiry.’    PRY constructions constrain mood expression more than polarity. They are
found as polar questions (ólí émá ú' kéré? [the yam PRP.be small] ‘Is the yam
small?’) and negative statements (ólí émà í ì ù kéré [the yam SC NEG be small] ‘The
yam is not small’). However, they never appear as imperatives or prohibitives.
    PRY frames constrain inflection, auxiliary and preverb categories. They inflect
for Present and Past perfect, imperfect Habitual and prospective Predictive. They
never appear in imperfect Continuous or prospective Anticipative.(43) a. ólì èkpèn ú          / ólí ékpén ú'        nwènénwèné.

        the yam PRED be small
        ‘The yam will be small.’     PRY u allows some modality and relative tense categories. It accepts all epistem-
ic forms (ólí émá má' ú kéré [the yam PAP.CER be small] ‘The yam surely is small’, ólí
émá khà ú kéré [the yam PAP.HYP be small] ‘The yam would have been small’) ex-
cept rational judgment Deductive za and Resultative za. A polar interrogative con-
struction is required for Concessive rere (ólí émá ré'rè ú kéré? [the yam PAP.CONC be
small] ‘Is the yam even small?’) as well as Dubitatives bia (ólí émá bíá' ú kéré? [the
440 | Be, do, happen and haveyam PAP.DUB be small] ‘Was the yam actually small?’) and vba (ólí émá vbá' ú kéré?
[the yam PAP.DUB be small] ‘Could the yam really be small?’). PRY rejects deontic
Hortative í. As for relative tense, PRY u disallows Anterior ke but permits Subse-
quent kpe (ólí émá kpé' ú kéré [the yam PAP.SUB be small] ‘The yam is yet small
despite pending conditions’).
     In PRY constructions preverbs are extremely restricted. One finds phasal aspec-
tualizer gbo (ólí émá gbó' ú kéré [the yam PAP.ADD be small] ‘The yam is small too’),
che (ólí émà chéè ú kéré (vbí éó mè) [the yam PRP.REP be small LOC face my] ‘The
yam is again small to my eyes’), ghe (ólí émà ghéè ú kéré (vbí éó mè) [the yam
PRP.PCT be small LOC face my] ‘The yam is just small to my eyes’), and se (ólí éwé
sé' ú kéré [the goat PAP.DUR be small] ‘The goat continues to be small’). Ungram-
matical are boundary aspectualizers: Conative òó, Ingressive ya, and Egressive mo.
     PRY u accepts none of the remaining preverb classes. Rejected are all members
of the classes evaluative (kuku), temporal (kpao), manner-demonstrative (ìyó), sub-
ject attributive (dégbe) and quantity (zemi): *ólí ómóhé kú'kù / kpá'ò / íyó' / dé'gbè /
zé'mì ú négénnégén [the man PAP.POEV initially DMD steadily ABSI be wiry] ‘The
man afterall / initially / that way / steadily / is wiry’.
     In addition, PRY constructions do not allow affixal categories, postverbal tem-
poral particles or temporal adverbs typically associated with verbs. PRY rejects Per-
severative prefix (Ci), Factative (-i) and Distributive (-lo/lo/no): *élí ímóhé ú-ló'
khúíéé [the men PAP.be-DS slim] ‘Each of the men is slim.’ PRY u also rejects Tem-
poral Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*ólí ómóhé ú' négénégén léé / gbé
[the man PAP.be wiry TEMP much] ‘The man is already / far too wiry’) in addition to
deictic temporal adjuncts such as èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí ómò ú khúíéé èghéènà [the
child PRP.be slim recently] ‘The child was recently slim’).
     PRY u minimally constrains associated grammatical relations. The nominal po-
sition preceding u expresses the grammatical relation subject. It takes personal
pronouns in the nominative (o, yan); it rejects indefinite subject pronoun (a).(44) ó / yán / *á       ú'       nwènénwèné.
     it they one PAP.be spotted
     ‘It is / They are spotted.’    PRY subject position is not uniquely constrained as to NP type, animacy or defi-
niteness. For NP type, subject position permits proper names.(45) òhí ú'       khúíéé.
     Ohi PAP.be slim
     ‘Ohi was slim.’
                                                                    ‘be’ forms | 441Likewise, PRY subject accepts common nouns, irrespective of animacy (human ómò,
animate ófè, inanimate úkpóràn). Each, though, must be syntactically elaborated,
by the definite article for example.(46) a. ólí ómò / *ómò        ú     kpéké.

        ‘The infant is short.’

        the stick        cloth     PRP.be small
        ‘The stick is small.’Bare noun subjects are acceptable only in generic PRY constructions marked by
Habitual aspect.(47) ékpén ó ò ú nwènénwèné.
     leopard SC H be spotted
     ‘Leopards are spotted.’     Subject position in PRY constructions permits a range of postdeterminers. It ac-
cepts demonstratives such as nà and nóì (óókhó nóì / ólí óókhó nà ú nwènénwèné
[chicken next the chicken this PRP.be spotted] ‘The next chicken / this chicken is
spotted’), existential quantifiers, partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé (óókhó ósò /
óvbèé ú nwènénwèné [chicken certain another PRP.be spotted] ‘A certain / Another
chicken is spotted’), as well as universal quantifier èrèmé and numerals such as
collective èvèvá and cardinal èvá (éókhó èrèmé / èvèvá / èvá ú' nwènénwèné [chick-
ens all both two PAP.be spotted] ‘All / both / two chickens are spotted’). Only kin-
dreds (deictic élìyó, contrastive ódàn) are unacceptable.
     PRY subject position minimally restricts impersonal pronouns.9 It permits pro-
nouns for demonstrative (óáìn), universal quantifier (èrèmé), partitive and contras-
tive existential quantifier (ósò, óvbèé) in (óáìn / óvbèé / ósò / èrèmé ú' nwènénwèné
[that.one other.one some all PAP.be spotted] ‘That one is/ Another is / Some are /
All are spotted’). Numerals (collective èvèvá, cardinal èvá), too, are acceptable (èvá /
èvèvá / èvá vbí íyáín ú' nwènénwèné [two both two LOC them PAP.be spotted] ‘Two /
both / two of them are spotted’). However, PRY subject prohibits kindred pronouns
(deictic élìyó, contrastive ódàn).
     In PRY constructions , discourse repositioning of assigned and property constit-
uents is constrained asymmetrically.10 Subject position corresponds to a constituent
in focus or topic position.

     b. ólí émà, ó ú'           kéré.
        the yam it PAP.be small
        ‘As for the yam, it is small.’The property term position following u, however, never corresponds to focus posi-
tion (*négénégén lí ólí ómóhé ú' [wiry PF the man PAP.be] ‘It is wiry that the man is’)
or topic position (*négénégén, ólí ómòhè ú [wiry the man PRP.be] ‘A wiry character is
what the man is’).
     PRY and its constituents correspond to two information question types. Subject
corresponds to a question with sortal significance framed by émé' and distal demon-
strative áìn. émé' alone is insufficient. As a response, a bare noun in a Specifier cop-
ula óò construction is required. A PRY clause as response is unacceptable. No other
interrogative pronoun (e.g. óé' ‘who’ or ékà ‘how many’) queries PRY subject.(49) émé' ó ú'         nwènénwèné áìn?

     ‘It’s a leopard.’        ‘A leopard is spotted.’PRY constructions also correspond to a manner query framed by interrogative pro-
noun ébé', Manner preverb i and verb ri ‘be located.’ In response, a PRY construc-
tion with property term in situ is acceptable. A specifier copula óò answer is not.(50) ébé' ólí ómóhé í'           ríì?

framed by the complementary predicates ri and e. Each is followed by a preposition-
al phrase headed by vbi: NP ri vbi NP, NP e vbi NP. Concerning their distribution, ri
                                                                    ‘be’ forms | 443appears under realis conditions, e.g. affirmative declarative in the perfect, and e
under irrealis conditions, e.g. imperfect and prospective aspect, negation and deon-
tic modality.
     LCT with ri and e differ in polarity and mood potential. e but not ri accepts Per-
fect Negation. Neither construction displays an imperative or prohibitive shape.(51) ólì òkpòsò í ì        è / *rì    vbí ìwè.

        the woman SC NEG be LOC house
        ‘Isn't the woman in the house?’    LCT constructions with ri and e show complementary inflection, auxiliaries and
preverbs. Aspect is expressed tonally in an irregular fashion. For Past perfect, ri
shows low tone and right edge high tone subject. For Present perfect, ri shows high
low tone and right edge low tone subject. Under conditions typical for Past and
Present perfect, ri would have shown, respectively, downstepped high (rí') and a
simple high (rí) tone (*ólí ókpósó rí' / ólì òkpòsò rí vbì èkìn [the woman be / the wom-

       the woman PRED be LOC house
       ‘The woman will be in the house.’     LCT constructions selectively express deontic and epistemic modality. e accepts
deontic Hortative (ólì òkpòsò í è vbì ìwè [the woman HOR be LOC house] ‘The woman
should be in the house’) and epistemic Hypothetical kha (ólí ókpósó khà é vbì ìwè
[the woman PAP.HYP be LOC house] ‘The woman would have been in the house’). ri
accepts neither.
     Locative ri accepts Dubitatives vba (ólí ókpósó vbá' rì vbí ìwè? [the woman
PAP.DUB be LOC house] ‘Could the woman really be in the house?’, ólì òkpòsò vbáà

and Certaintive ma (ólí ókpósó má' rì vbí ìwè [the woman PAP.CER be LOC house]
‘The woman surely was in the house’). Neither LCT predicate permits Concessive
rere or Resultative za.
     LCT predications restrict relative tense. ri admits Subsequent kpe (ólì òkpòsò kpé
rì / *é vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.SUB be be LOC house] ‘The woman was yet in the
house despite upcoming events’), whereas e permits neither relative tense Subse-
quent kpe nor Anterior ke.
     LCT imposes strong restrictions on preverbs. ri allows aspectualizers Durative se
(ólì òkpòsò séè rì vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.DUR be LOC house] ‘The woman contin-
ues to be in the house’) and Past Absolute mo (ólí ókpósó mó' rì vbí ìwè [the woman
PAP.PA be LOC house] ‘The woman at one time was in the house’).
     e permits Past Absolute ya but only in polar interrogatives (ólí ókpósó yà é vbí
íwé élá ódíánmì? [the woman PAP.PA be LOC house past afternoon] ‘Did the woman
used to be at home in the afternoons?’). No other aspectualizers are acceptable with
either LCT verb.
     LCT constructions reject all remaining preverb classes: evaluative (e.g. kuku),
temporal (e.g. kpao), subject attributive (e.g. dégbe), manner-demonstrative (e.g.
ìyó) and quantity (e.g. dobo óì), as shown in *ólì òkpòsò kúkù / kpáò / dégbè / íyó' /
dóbó óì rì vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.POEV initially steadily DMD REFL her be LOC
house] ‘The woman after all / initially / steadily / that way / by herself is in the
house’.
     In LCT constructions verb affixes, postverbal temporal particles and temporal
adjuncts are restricted. Relative to postverbal particles, ri with high low tone admits
Temporal Perspective lee but disallows Temporal Degree gbe (ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí

     Each LCT form allows temporal adjuncts consistent with its realis/irrealis char-
acter. ri with high low tone accepts ènyáà ‘just now’ (ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí ékín ènyáà
[the youth PRP.be LOC market just.now] ‘The youth is in the market right now’),
which otherwise occurs with Continuous and Anticipative, and e allows éènà ‘today’
(ólí óvbékhán ló è vbí ékín éènà [the youth PRED be LOC market today] ‘The youth
will be in the market today’) and ákhò ‘tomorrow’ (ólí óvbékhán ló è vbí ékín ákhò
[the youth PRED be LOC market tomorrow] ‘The youth will be in the market tomor-
row’). Neither LCT predicate allows any other deictic adjunct, in particular òdè ‘yes-
terday’ (*ólí óvbékhán rì vbí ékín òdè [the youth PAP.be LOC market yesterday] ‘The
youth was in the market yesterday’) and èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí ékín
èghéènà [the youth PRP.be LOC market recently] ‘The youth was in the market re-
cently’).
     Neither ri nor e combines with any verb affix, e.g. Perseverative Ci-, Factative -i,
or Distributive -lo/lo/no : *élí íkpósó rì-lò / é-ló' vbì ìwè [the women PAP.be-DS be-DS
LOC house] ‘The women are in the house’.
     LCT noun phrases contrast regarding NP type, animacy and syntax. Similar
constraints affect ri and e. The initial noun phrase in LCT constructions has few
restrictions. It shows subject position properties. The noun phrase preceding ri ac-
cepts nominative pronouns, not emphatic pronouns or indefinite subject pronoun a.
It disallows deictic locative pronouns (e.g. ááìn ‘there’).(55) ì / mà / *mèmè /*à      ríì   vbí ìwè.

     Noun phrase complements of vbi in LCT ri/e constructions reveal place subcate-
gorization. When a noun does not inherently reflect a place value, syntactic elabora-
                                                                      ‘be’ forms | 447tion is required by a relational noun modifier or by an unmarked ébé' ‘where’ head-

"10.1 Comitative of action
Complex predicates that are transitive or intransitive identify a comitative relation
(Blake 2001) with kpaye (kpaa for some speakers) ‘accompany, move with’ as V1.
Comitative and subject participants co-locate to undertake an event. V2 consists of
activity verbs that are intransitive, e.g. dan ‘wrestle’ or vbaye ‘chat,’ or transitive,
e.g. ta ‘speak’ or sume ‘struggle over.’ Predication sense is ‘do with, together.’

predicates but not with singular NP1 as subject. Both dan and vbaye require a plural
grammatical subject. V2 sie takes singular or plural subjects.(10) a. élí ímòhè / *ólí ómòhè ò ó dán.

604 | Participant expressing complex predicatesAs a simple predicate, V1 kpaye only occurs with a direct object framed as an obliga-
tory external possession phrase, where a human noun possessor precedes a posses-
sum (Chapter 4,4.3.3.1). Possessum is restricted to the body-part term óbò ‘hand.’
And predication sense is ‘help, assist, give a helping hand,’ which appears derived
idiomatically from ‘accompany someone’s hand.’(12) òjè kpáyé              áléké óbò.

constructions expressing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and
mood as well as argument repositioning in discourse. Relative to aspect, complex
kpaye predications show variable patterns. For instance, predications with kpaye
vbaye inflect for imperfect Continuous but not Present or Past perfect.(13) ólí ómòhè ò ó kpàyè           mé vbàyé.

Complex predicates that are transitive and convey change of state express a substi-
tutive relation (Blake 2001) with kpaye (kpaa for some speakers) ‘replace’ as V1.
kpaye subject (ólí ómóhé ‘the man’) specifies an event participant that substitutes
for kpaye direct object (òlólò ‘Ololo’). V2 consists of transitive verbs such as e ‘eat’ or
hian ‘cut.’ Predication sense is ‘replace, do in place of, in lieu of, instead of.’(19) a. ójé kpáyé'         òlólò é ólí émàè.

Complex predicates convey a sociative relation (Blake 2001) with de baa ‘join’ as V1.
The sociative participant joins and accompanies other event participants. V2 con-
sists of activity verbs that are intransitive (e.g. sie ‘play’) or transitive (e.g. sua ìmátò
‘push car’). Predication sense is ‘do with, together, join and do.’(32) a. ólí ómó dé'          báá ínyó      óì síé.

      ‘Oje joined the youths to do it. / Oje did it with the youths.’    NP1 and NP2 participants in de baa predications spatially co-locate. NP1 subject
position requires a human noun, nonhuman animates (éwè) are excluded. NP2 re-
quires a human noun; nonhuman animates (éwè) are also unacceptable.(35) a. *ólí éwè dé            báá ònwìmè kén ògèdè.

Complex predicates articulate a comitative relation (Blake 2001) for posture and
position change events with V1 kpeen ‘support, prop up, wedge in.’ Participants
spatially co-locate. V1 consists of intransitive posture verbs, e.g. muzan ‘stand,’ dia
‘sit,’ and mehen ‘lie,’ or transitive verbs of object manipulation, e.g. nwu ‘take hold’
or fi ‘leave.’ Predication sense is ‘be with, alongside, by.’(47) a. òjè múzán         kpéén òlólò.

          Oje PRP.do it support Ololo
          ‘Oje did it with Ololo.’     Participants encoded by noun phrases in kpeen predications co-locate (intransi-
tive NP1 and NP2 or transitive NP2 and NP3). Comitative kpeen complements, wheth-
er intransitive NP2 or transitive NP3, require human noun direct objects. Nonhuman,
animate nouns (éwè) are unacceptable.

      the goat PRP.stand support Oje
      ‘The goat stood with Oje.’    Complex predications with comitative kpeen do not deconstruct strictly as sim-
ple verbs, although they share NP1. V1 muzan appears as an intransitive with NP1 as
subject but not as a transitive verb with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object.(53) òjè múzán-ì.    /     *òjè múzán       òlólò.

Complex predicates with transitive verb re ‘take/use’ in series mark the semantic
relations instrument, means, stimulus or durative time. Assignment of a particular
relation correlates in large measure with event verb type: instrument with change of
state, means with activity, stimulus with cognition, and temporal duration with
prolonged activity verbs, as illustrated immediately below.(62) a. ólí óvbèkhàn ré          údò gbé ákhè á.

    Complex temporal re predications exhibit additional properties when express-
ing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as argu-
ment repositioning in discourse. Relative to aspect, re predications inflect for Past

Complex predicates articulate a goal relation (Blake 2001) with gbe ‘hit’ as V2 in
series. This relation requires forceful contact of a moving entity with a stationary
object. V1 position accepts transitive and intransitive verbs of motion or causation.
Predication sense is ‘hit, against.’(116) a. òjè gbúlú      ólí ókò     gbé ìmátò.

       Oje PRP.do it hit car
       ‘Oje did it against the car.’Noun phrase positions in contactive gbe predications show distinctive properties.
NP3 position following gbe accepts an animate or inanimate noun.

and NP2 as direct object.(121) a. ólì òkpòsò fí            úkpóràn.

subject and a musical instrument direct object, gbe has the sense ‘beat, strike, play,
hit.’ gbe does not express sense ‘beat, hit’ with inanimate direct objects that serve as
NP3 in complex predications.(123) a. ólí ómòhè gbé            ólì ìbè.

          Oje PRP.hit car        wall

      the man SC C beat the youth
      ‘The man is beating / hitting the youth.’In series, re and direct object òè ‘leg’ join gbe to express contactive ‘kick.’(125) ólí óvbékhán ré'       òè gbé ìbóòlù.
      the youth     PAP.use leg hit ball
      ‘The youth kicked the ball with his leg.’With plural body-part ábò ‘hands’ as direct object, gbe conveys sense ‘clap.’(126) òjè ò ó gbè ábò.
      Oje SC C hit hands
      ‘Oje is clapping his hands.’    Complex predications with contactive gbe reveal additional properties when
conveying aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as argument
repositioning in discourse. Relative to aspect, contactive gbe is constrained by V1.
With verb fi ‘throw,’ they inflect for Past and Present perfect and Continuous.(127) a. ólí óvbékhán fí'            údò gbé ùdékèn.

course. Equally, predications with a human noun as NP3 allow their subject and
direct object position to correspond to a focus position constituent.(133) a. ólí ókpósó nà lí ó fí'               úkpóràn gbé òjè.

Complex predicates specify a comparative relation with lee ‘surpass’ in series as V2.
Participants marked by lee serve as a standard of comparison along some dimension
for the subject participant. V1 consists of transitive or intransitive verbs whose sca-
lar conditions can be identified for comparison. Predication sense is ‘more than.’(134) a. ólí ómòhè ón            àmè léé     mè.

        ‘Afuze is farther than Oke.’As well, V1 position in complex comparative predications does not accept copula
forms such as vbi ‘be’ or intransitive directional motion verbs such as o ‘enter.’(135) a. *ólí ómòhè vbì       ònwìmè léé       òhí.

       Oje PAP.do it surpass Aleke
       ‘Oje did more than Aleke.’     Noun phrase positions in lee predications exhibit distinctive properties. De-
pending on V1 transitivity, NP1 subject is measured against intransitive NP2 or tran-
sitive NP3. Illustrating with intransitives, lee marked NP2 position accepts animate
(òhí), inanimate (éànmì) or locative (íwé) nouns.(137) a. òlólò dá            léé       òhí.

such as focus, where NP1 corresponds to a focus position constituent. Without such
a context, the lee marked noun phrase does not allow ellipsis.
                                                                   Comparative | 635(138) a. éhèèn lí ó kpó'                lèè.

ple predicate, transitive V1 on ‘drink’ occurs with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct
object, and intransitive da ‘be tall’ appears with NP1 as subject.(141) a. ólí ómòhè ón          àmè.

lee rejects nouns that are nonhuman animate (èkpèn, éìn).(143) a. ólí ómòhè léé             òhí.

restrict aspect. They inflect for Past and Present perfect or imperfect Habitual but
not imperfect Continuous.

          ‘It was Aleke alone that Oje drank more water than.’10.8 Ablative
Complex predicates specify an ablative relation (Blake 2001) with V2 in series shoo
re/re and its locative vbi complement. shoo vbi re/vbi re marked referents express
location and distance from which an entity is removed. V1 consists of object manip-
ulation verbs such as nwu ‘take’ that are compatible with extraction and removal of
a direct object participant. Predication sense is ‘remove from, away from, out of, off
of,’ depending on V2 form.(152) a. òjè nwú      ólì èkpà shóó vbì ìtébù ré.
         Oje PRP.take the bag exit LOC table arrive
         ‘Oje removed the bag away from the table.’
      b. òjè nwú      ólì èkpà vbì ìtébù ré.
         Oje PRP.take the bag LOC table arrive
         ‘Oje removed the bag from the table.’Via its V2 form, ablative predications convey degree of distance moved by NP2 rela-
tive to NP3. When V2 position is assumed by shoo vbi re, distance removed is con-
strued as distal relative to the proximal relation that obtains when V2 position is
held by vbi re. Ablative predications fail when re does not occur as part of V2.(153) a. ólí ómòhè yí         àbà shóó vbì òtòì       ré.
         the man PRP.pull pin exit LOC ground arrive
         ‘The man pulled a pin away from the ground.’

        the woman PRP.collect peelings exit LOC yam arrive
        ‘The woman removed the peelings away from the yam.’
     d. ólì òkpòsò líé           ìkùkù    vbí émà ré.
        the woman PRP.collect peelings LOC yam arrive
        ‘The woman removed the peelings from the yam.’Ablative predications with shoo re fail with pro-verb u ‘do’ as V1.(154)*òjè ú       óì shóó vbì ìtébù ré.
      Oje PRP.do it exit LOC table arrive
      ‘Oje removed it from the table.’    Noun phrase positions in shoo vbi re predications are constrained. As vbi com-
plement in ablative predications, NP3 accepts the nondeictic locative pronoun o but
not deictic locative pronouns (e.g. èàn, èvbò).(155) òjè nwú       ólì èkpà shóó vbì ò /*èàn / *èvbò ré.
      Oje PRP.take the bag exit LOC it here yonder arrive
      ‘Oje removed the bag from it.’NP3 in ablative predications accepts inanimate nouns construed as locations. It does
not accept animate or human nouns.(156) *òjè nwú       ólì èkpà shóó vbì èsí / àlèkè ré.
       Oje PRP.take the bag exit LOC horse Aleke arrive
       ‘Oje removed the bag from the horse / Aleke.’Information questions corresponding to NP3 utilize a proximal V2 re phrase. The
interrogative pronoun for NP3 is ébé' ‘where,’ provided its following clause shows za
‘be located’ in series with V1 and re, not V1 and shoo re.(157) ébé' ójé zá'         nwú ólì èkpà ré    / *shóó ólì èkpà ré?
      where Oje PAP.be.loc take the bag arrive exit the bag arrive
      ‘Where did Oje remove the bag from?’    Complex shoo vbi re predicates fail to deconstruct strictly. As a simple verb, V1
accepts NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object.
640 | Participant expressing complex predicates(158) òjè nwú        ólì èkpà.
      Oje PRP.take the bag
      ‘Oje carried the bag.’V2 shoo vbi re takes NP1 as subject and NP3 as locative complement, although in the
ablative construction it is NP2 not NP1 that undergoes repositioning. shoo vbi re fails
to accept NP2 as subject with NP3 as locative complement.(159) òjè / *ólì èkpà shóó      vbì ìtébù ré.
      Oje the bag PRP.exit LOC table arrive
      ‘Oje left / moved away from the table.’As a synchronic predicate, shoo re takes a locative vbi complement to express the
sense ‘exit, leave.’ Neither shoo nor re alone is sufficient to convey this meaning.(160) òjè shóó       vbí úkpódè ré.
      Oje PRP.exit LOC road     arrive
      ‘Oje exited the road.’    Complex shoo vbi re ablatives reveal further properties when conveying aspect,
aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as argument repositioning in
discourse. Complex ablative predications do not limit aspect. Regardless of shoo
inclusion, they inflect for Present and Past perfect as well as Continuous.(161) a. ólí ómòhè yí          àbà (shóó) vbì òtòì      ré.

         ‘Did the man pull the pin from the ground?’In discourse, ablative shoo re predications allow argument repositioning with some
conditions. Subject and direct object of V1 correspond to focus position. However,
complement of vbi corresponds to focus only when the matrix clause shows verb za
‘be located’ in series, neither shoo re nor re occurs, and focus position displays em-
phatic marking, e.g. ótóí vbì èvbò rather than simple òtòì.(165) a. òjè lí ó yí'            ólì àbà vbì òtòì       ré.

642 | Participant expressing complex predicates10.9 Allative
Complex predicates express an allative relation with V2 ye ‘move to, toward’ and its
direct object in series. Allative direct objects are recipients of possession transfer
construed as temporary. They contrast with permanent transfer Applicative li/ni
predications (Chapter 9, 9.1). V1 in allative ye predications accepts object manipula-
tion verbs fi ‘throw,’ chie ‘return,’ nwu ‘take hold’ or roo ‘pick out,’ among others.
Predication sense highlights ‘do to/for.’(166) a. ólí ómòhè fí            úkpóràn yé        òhí.

         the man PRP.fetch wood move.to the old.woman
         ‘The man fetched wood for the old woman.’V1 position in allative ye predications rejects pro-verb u ‘do.’(167) *òjè ú          óì yé         ólì ònwìmè.
       Oje PRP.do it move.to the farmer
       ‘Oje did it for the farmer.’Relative to V1 position, allative ye predications reject permanent possession transfer
verbs such as shen ‘sell.’6(168) *ólì òkpòsò shén    émà yé         ònwìmè.
       the woman PRP.sell yam move.to farmer
       ‘The woman sold yam to a farmer.’     The noun phrase position subcategorized by ye in allative predications is re-
stricted. NP3 nominals in complex ye predications accept only human nouns. Non-
human animate nouns (éwè ‘goat’) are unacceptable.
                                                                    Allative | 643(169) ólì òkpòsò nwú      émà yé        ònwìmè / *éwè.

and NP2 as direct object.(172) ólì òkpòsò nwú       émà.
      the woman PRP.take yam
      ‘The woman carried yam.’As a simple predicate, V2 ye occurs with neither NP1 as subject and NP3 as direct

Complex predicates represent an addressee relation with V2 vbiee ‘show’ and its
human noun direct object. vbiee predications express unidirectional information
transfer from speaker to vbiee marked addressee. Predication sense assumes neither
a bidirectional verbal exchange between speaker and hearer nor a transfer of infor-
mation by vocal means. V1 consists of a variety of transitive verbs of information
transfer. Predication sense is akin to English ‘express to.’(181) a. ólì òkpòsò kpé          ìtàn    vbíéé ólí ómòhè.

       ‘The woman / secret showed the man.’As a simple predicate, vbiee manifests two senses relative to information transfer:
instructional ‘teach’ and demonstrative ‘show.’ With a double object complement
whose first object is a human noun, vbiee expresses ‘teach.’ Neither object position
alone is sufficient as vbiee complement.(190) àlèkè vbíéé       ólí ómóhé ìsóòmù.

object allows an accusative pronoun (óì), second object permits only the quasi-
placeholder noun émì ‘thing,’ not an accusative pronoun.

650 | Participant expressing complex predicates10.11 Bidirectional communication addressee
Complex predicates articulate an addressee relation with V2 ree ‘take after’ and its
direct object in series. An event participant marked by ree serves as addressee of a
reciprocal, bidirectional transfer of communication that assumes a forthcoming
reply. ree predications accept only ye ‘send’ in V1 position followed by a human
noun or the noun úhùnmì ‘message.’ Predication sense is ‘send after.’(200) a. ólí ómòhè yé         óvbèkhàn réé           ólì òkpòsò.
         the man PRP.send youth           take.after the woman
         ‘The man sent a youth after the woman.’
      b. ólí ómòhè yé         úhùnmì réé           ólì òkpòsò.
         the man PRP.send message take.after the woman
         ‘The man sent a message after the woman.’V1 position in bidirectional ree predications does not accept pro-verb u ‘do.’(201) *ólí ómòhè ú          óì réé       ólì òkpòsò.
       the man PRP.do it take.after the woman
       ‘The man did it after the woman.’Complex ye ree predicates contrast with complex ye ye predicates. The latter express
a communication transfer that carries no expectation of a reply.(202) a. ólí ómòhè yé         óvbèkhàn yé        ólì òkpòsò.
         the man PRP.send youth          move.to the woman

         the man PRP.send message move.to the woman
         ‘The man sent a message to the woman.’     Noun phrase positions in complex ree predicates are constrained. NP3 as direct
object of ree accepts only human nouns. It takes neither headless associative
phrases with human noun possessors (ésì ólì òkpòsò) that convey place (assuming
ellipted ìwè ‘house’ for example) nor proper nouns of place (e.g. áfúzé').(203) *òjè yé         óvbèkhàn réé           ésì ólì òkpòsò / áfúzé'.

      who the man PAP.send the youth          take.after

      the man PRP.send it take.after the woman
      ‘The man sent it after the woman.’    Complex predicates with ree do not deconstruct strictly as simple verbs. They do
not share NP1. V1 ye appears as a simple predicate with NP1 as subject and NP2 as
direct object, provided NP2 is a human noun (óvbèkhàn). The metonymic noun
úhùnmì as direct object in simple ye predications is unacceptable.(207) ólí ómòhè yé         óvbèkhàn / *úhùnmì.
      the man PRP.send youth           message
      ‘The man sent a youth.’V2 ree does not accept NP1 or NP2 as subject and NP3 as direct object, even when NP3

          the man      youth     PRP.take.after the woman

          the message PRP.take.after the woman
          ‘The message took after the woman.’As a simple predicate, intransitive ree followed by bí ‘like’ conveys a judgment of
physical resemblance. ree as a simple transitive verb does not convey resemblance.7(209) ólí óvbèkhàn réè             bí érá       óì.

ties when expressing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood

Present perfect but not imperfect Continuous.(210) a. ólí ómòhè yé          ólí óvbèkhàn réé          ólì òkpòsò.

Complex predicates show deictic motion verbs in the expression of locative goal
relations. Two verbs differentiated by aspect are involved. Deictic verbs vare ‘came,
will come’ or vade ‘comes, coming’ each take a locative vbì complement as V2 in
series. A third deictic verb lode ‘go’ appears only as a simple predicate. It fails to
occur in complex predicates.(235) a. ólì òkpòsò váré vbì ìwè.

its locative vbi complement in perfect or prospective aspect. Locatives in vare predi-

tive (e.g. sua ‘push,’ fioo ‘blow,’ nwu ‘take/carry’) or intransitive (e.g. la ‘run’). Pred-

toward an assumed, unstated speaker position when vbi phrase and verb za ‘be at’

predications. As a simple predicate, lode takes a following vbi phrase complement.
It never occurs with a preceding vbi phrase and verb za ‘be located’ in series. lode
expresses direction of motion relative to a locative reference point and speaker.
Motion is toward the reference point and away from the speaker. Speaker position in
lode predications is assumed to be distinct from locative reference point. Moreover,
combining za and lode to express a source goal construction is disallowed.(265) a. òjè lòdé vbí íwé.

liquid, natural force or inanimate subjects. It also does not allow nouns referring to
entities capable of internally initiated movement (ólì ìmátò ‘the car’).(266) *ólí ófè / ólì ìòghò / éfìòò/ ólì ùgbòfì lòdé vbí ékóá mè.

       where Oje be.loc go
       ‘Where does Oje go?’    Simple predications with deictic lode disclose additional properties in construc-
tions conveying sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as
well as argument repositioning in discourse. Simple lode predications limit aspect.
They inflect for imperfect Continuous, although in an irregular fashion that relies
exclusively on tone. lode shows an initial low tone and a right edge low tone subject
phrase but no Continuous morphology. lode rejects Past and Present perfect.(269) òjè lòdé vbí édà.

          ‘It is the river that Oje goes to.’10.13.4 Source ~ goal predicationsComplex predicates articulate a relation of source and goal with za ‘move/be locat-
ed’ and its locative vbi complement as V1 in series. V2 consists of either ye ‘move
toward,’ se ‘move as far as/ reach’ or de re ‘fall to.’ Predication sense is ‘from loca-
tion X to location Y.’
     Source-Goal (SG) predications differentially articulate horizontal and vertical
motion as well as spatial and temporal extent. Motion on the horizontal plane with
no expression of manner is conveyed by za in series with ye. za and its complement
must precede ye and its complement, as is the case with all SG predications. A rever-
sal in the order of these verb phrases, i.e. goal then source, is unacceptable.(274) ólí ómòhè zá        vbí áfúzé' yé    òkè.
      the man PRP.be.loc LOC Afuze move.to Oke
      ‘The man moved from Afuze to Oke.’To express manner of motion from source to goal on the horizontal plane, za occurs
in series with verb se and a manner verb (e.g. transitive sua ‘push,’ fioo ‘blow,’ in-
transitive la ‘run’). The manner verb follows za but precedes se.(275) a. ójé zá'         vbí áfúzé' súá ìmátò sé  vbì òkè.

      the man PRP.be.loc LOC top             tree fall ground arrive

precede se and its complement.(277) ótóí mè zá             vbí áfúzé' sé    vbì òkè.
      land my PRP.be.loc LOC Afuze reach LOC Oke

         the land PRP.be.big be.loc LOC here reach LOC yonder
         ‘The land is big / broad from here to there.’Extent of a temporal nature from source time to goal time is formed with za in series
with se and an intervening activity verb like gbe ‘dance.’ In these predications, gbe
cannot precede za.(279) ó zá'         vbí égbíà      gbé sé   vbí énwáà.
      he PAP.be.loc LOC morning dance reach LOC evening
      ‘He danced from morning to evening.’As indicated above, noun phrases serving as vbi complements in SG constructions
accept place or temporal nouns. With a human (ójé) or animate noun as reference
point, syntactic elaboration is required. For example, source and goal can each
show a pronominally headed relative clause framed by ri ‘be located.’

  In addition, it is important to recognize that not every participant in a serial verb construction
serves as an event argument, where argument refers to a relation entailed by an event. This seems
particularly the case with substitutive, comitative and sociative participant roles that follow V1 in
serial verb constructions and the comparative participant role that occurs as V2 in series.","[627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697]"

Two forms of the Associative exist: ésì and ísì. Each occurs under distinct semantic
conditions. ésì is restricted to expressions of temporary location, whereas ísì ex-
presses more permanent location along with alienable and inalienable possession,
partitive and spatial orientation, social collectives, and purposive relations.
    ísì framed noun phrases express alienable and inalienable relations between
possessum and possessor, with possessum preceding ísì. Possessor position permits
various noun types. For instance, it accepts proper names (òjè).úkpún ísì òjè                          ùgín ísì òjè

formly. Omission of ísì is controlled by possessor number and person. First and third
person pronouns act uniformly while second person reveals a split distribution.
Singular èé behaves like third person and plural àvbá like first person. Under condi-
tions of ísì omission, the possessor pronoun assumes accusative rather than genitive
form (Chapter 5, 5.3).

conveyed by contrasting Associative markers ísì and ésì.11 Temporary occupation of
a dwelling is designated by ésì. Possessum under this condition can be realized as

tion (direct object and locative complement) and verb type (physical change of loca-
tion/material state vs cognition). Possessors may be internal (follow) or external
(precede) to their possessa constituent. When external, ísì fails to appear, posses-
sors undergo high tone spread and possessors assume accusative form.
     In direct object or locative complements of change of state or change of location
verbs, possessors follow or precede possessa. When a disjoint condition, i.e. separa-
tion, exists between possessor and possessum, possessor (òjè) follows possessum
and Associative ísì. The possessor is assumed to be less fully affected by verb event,
if affected at all.

predicate that incorporates Change of State particle a, which confirms a telic end
state. As a consequence, there is no further cutting of the body part. Since this end
state assumes the existence of a disjoint relation between possessor and possessum,
possessum precedes possessor with ísì interposed.(7)   ólí ómòhè híán       áwé ísì òjè á / *híán ójé àwè á.
      the man PRP.cut legs ASS Oje CS       cut Oje legs CS
      ‘The man cut the legs off from Oje.’    Position of possessor relative to possessum is constrained by several additional
factors including grammatical relation and verb type. Although external possessors
occur in direct object and locative argument positions under appropriate pragmatic
conditions, they never occur in subject position. As well, they never occur in the
discourse defined positions of topic, focus or right dislocated position.(8) úkpún ísì òjè / *ójé úkpùn tóó          á'.
    cloth ASS Oje        Oje cloth PRP.burn CS
    ‘The cloth of Oje burned up.’External possessors also never appear in indirect object position marked by Applica-
tive li/ni or in either noun phrase constituent of a double object construction.

       ‘They hit Oje's goat with Ohi's fly whisk.’External possessors in direct object position are precluded by verb type. Transitive
verbs that do not entail a change of state or location disallow external possessors in
direct object position. The activity verb da ‘drink’ disallows an external possessor.(10) ólí ómòhè dá         ényó ísì òjè / *ójé ényò.
     the man PRP.drink wine ASS Oje          Oje wine
     ‘The man drank the wine of Oje / Oje’s wine.’Cognition verbs similarly limit external possessor. Regardless of alienability rela-

verbs.(11) a. ólì òkpòsò záwó     íbátá ísì òjè / *ójé íbàtà.

Partitive (part-whole) relations are framed by ísì phrases. Part nominals precede
whole nominals, with ísì interposed. Partitive ísì phrases affect expression of food
stuffs, plants and other naturally occurring phenomena. Although both part and

Associative ísì phrases convey a relation of spatial orientation. Orientation nouns
precede ísì and locative reference point nouns follow ísì. For one subclass of orienta-
tion terms, many derived from body-part terms, ísì is obligatory. Absence of ísì is
ungrammatical (*ísáó ìwè ‘front of house,’ *éhón úkpódè ‘edge of the road’).ísáó ísì ìwè                            éhón ísì úkpódè

constrained. When reference point position shows an animate noun, ísì is obligatory
(*úókhó ólí ómòhè ‘back of the man,’ *égbé éwè ‘near the goat,’ *ésèsé élí árèò

Associative ísì phrases articulate a semantic relation of purpose between an instru-
ment and an affected entity. Instrument precedes affected entity, with ísì interposed.
For one subclass of constructions, ísì is obligatory (*ífí áfìánmì ‘bird trap,’ *ébé

‘trap for a bird / bird trap’           ‘leaf for wound cure’For another subclass, too, ísì is obligatory. However, the resulting phrases show
related compounds framed by instrument and affected entity nouns. For these com-
pounds, the purposive interpretation is no longer available, giving way to a non-
purposive, maximum quantity interpretation.

Kin relation phrases are unmarked by Associative ísì and reflect two classes. Kinship
is articulated as a blood or nonblood relation relative to “ego” expressed as animate
possessor. The kin term manifests high tone spread and precedes possessor.
     Kin constituent position accepts nouns differing as to grammatical number and
syntactic distribution. One class is illustrated by kin terms expressing parental and
nonparental relations. Parental relation terms (ínyó, érá) do not inflect for grammat-
ical number.

Attributive complements within complex noun phrases show marked and unmarked
patterns. Marked attributives are signaled by Relator li. It follows a head noun,
which undergoes high tone spread, and precedes an attributive complement. li
complements include abstract nominals, adjectives, nominalized stative verbs, and
deictic pronouns. Unmarked attributives lack Relator li and express distributive and
quantitative meanings in contrast to li marked collective and size meanings.","[219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240]"
"    ASPECT MODALITY RELATIVE-TENSE PREVERB3.1 Inflectional and auxiliary categories
Segmental morphemes that convey affirmative and negative inflection, modality
(deontic and epistemic) and relative tense are the following:Affirmative Aspect                     Negative Aspect
ò/à Habitual                           ì   Perfect Negation

kha Hypothetical                       kpe Subsequent
rere/ re Concessive     Inflection, specifically affirmative and negative aspect, along with subject
phrase tone is the cornerstone of Emai tonal structure within a clause. Affirmative
polarity shows perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect. No segmental forms con-
vey perfect aspect; instead, perfect aspect is signaled by subject phrase tone and
predicate phrase tone. Segmental forms that are mutually exclusive express imper-
fect and prospective aspect. Imperfect, when realized by a lexical rather than pro-
nominal subject, requires subject concord. In the expression of perfect and prospec-
tive aspect, concord is rarely exploited. Distinctions within perfect and prospective
are conveyed by a contrast in subject phrase tone. Negative polarity consists of Per-
fect, Prospective, and Past Absolute categories. When realized by a lexical rather
than pronominal subject, negation requires subject concord.
100 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs     Segmental forms in the categories of inflection, auxiliary and preverb exhibit
fixed or variable tone. Most auxiliary and preverb categories are assigned tone val-
ues by inflection. They thus show variable high, low or contour tone relative to the
fixed tone of inflectional elements conveying affirmative and negative aspect. Ex-
ceptions to this general rule are irrealis forms such as Hortative, Hypothetical and
the Conative preverb, which reveal a fixed tone. Across the categories aspect, mo-
dality, relative tense and preverb, tone value and morpheme sense interrelate. Some
segmental forms exhibit alternating tonal values (high and low) that co-vary with
alternating tonal values of the subject phrase. Each tone-form combination denotes
a distinct grammatical function. Other segmental forms show a single tone that
combines with alternating tonal values of the subject phrase. In this case, too, each
tone-form combination designates a distinct grammatical function. And still other
segmental forms manifest a single tone, combine with a single subject phrase tone,
and designate a single grammatical function.
     Two tone patterns characterize subject phrase exponents. One appears on a
pronoun that shows either a low tone (ò ‘he, she, it’) or high tone (ó ‘he, she, it’). A
second appears on a lexically specified noun phrase with a right edge low tone (òjè
‘Oje,’ ólí ómòhè ‘the man,’ ólí ómóhé nà ‘this man’) or a right edge high tone (ójé, ólí
ómóhé, ólí ómóhé ná). Right edge tone on grammatical subject affects expression of
inflection as well as auxiliary, relative tense and preverbs.","[125, 126]"

 The component forms of ba kun do not have equivalent predication potential. ba has the related
sense ‘stalk, spy on,’ whereas kun as a simple predicate fails as a synchronic form.(i) òjè ò ó bà ínì.
    Oje SC C stalk elephant
    ‘Oje is stalking / spying on an elephant.’

  With a human noun subject (òjè) and an abstract noun direct object (ólì ìsóòmù), ba kun asserts
‘pursue, explore in vain, without success.’(i) òjè bá           ólì ìsóòmù      kún.
    Oje PRP.pursue the arithmetic in.vain
    ‘Oje unsuccessfully attempted / explored the arithmetic problem.’9
  Although V1 position shows a complex predicate with postverbal Applicative li/ni, it does not
allow CL o or CS a. Moreover, even in the li/ni instance, there is no commitment to a telic end state
with V2, i.e. whether Aleke did or did not eat yam is outside the scope of assertion. This contrasts
with nonstative confirmation predications, which commit to the end state implied by V2.(i) a. òjè nwú        émà lí     áléké è.

  Three other senses are expressed by verb se. One arises with a vbi-marked locative complement. se
vbi expresses physical motion ‘move up to, move as far as, reach,’ locative nouns serving as vbi
complement.(i) ólí ómòhè sé         vbí áfúzé'.
    the man PRP.reach LOC Afuze
    ‘The man reached Afuze / got as far as Afuze.’se also exhibits a temporal sense with temporal noun subjects or with a pleonastic subject pronoun
and an extraposed temporal relative clause (its logical subject) as vbi complement.

      ‘Our charms are effective.’12
  The form gbe exhibits additional usage patterns. In series with instrument predicate re, gbe exhib-
its the contact sense ‘hit, strike’ or ‘kick,’ depending on nature of the instrument nominal serving as
re direct object. This sense does not entail event iteration.(i) a. ólì òkpòsò ré         úkpóràn gbé ólí ómòhè.

       the youth      PRP.use leg hit ball
       ‘The youth kicked the ball with his leg / used his leg to kick the ball.’In perfect aspect with a human noun subject and an animate or human noun direct object, simple
gbe predicates carry the sense ‘kill.’(ii) ólí ómòhè gbé       ólí óvbèkhàn / ólí éwè.
     the man PRP.kill the youth          the goat
     ‘The man killed the youth / the goat.’13
     The verb khoon also has a transitive shape with inanimate subject and human direct object.(i) ólí émà khóón          òjè.
    the yam PRP.satisfy Oje
    ‘The yam satisfied / pleased Oje.’14
   The verb so occurs in additional construction types expressing contact. In series with instrument
predicate re ‘take’ and its body-part complement, so conveys the nonforceful contact sense ‘touch.’(i) a. ólí ómòhè ré       égbè / óbò só      ólí óvbèkhàn.

ond object varies, so does English translation: ‘stab,’ ‘punch,’ ‘kick,’ or ‘shake,’ respectively, with
ògán ‘spear,’ èkpà ‘fist,’ ízà ‘heal,’ and óbò ‘hand.’(iii) a. ólí ómòhè só          ólí éwé ògán.

"8.2.2 Age construction u / vbiIn age constructions, the forms u and vbi occur in complementary distribution or
they alternate freely. This alternation reminds one of the nominal classifying copula
u/vbi (Chapter 8, 8.1.3). However, the copula form does not allow deontic and epis-
temic modality auxiliary forms. Age constructions do. Emai age constructions thus
employ transitive u ‘do’ where English relies on ‘be.’(102) a. ú ló        vbì / ù íkpè ìíhéén ákhò.
         you PRED do do years five tomorrow
         ‘You will be five years old tomorrow.’

         ‘It is today that she would have been ten years old.’
466 | Be, do, happen and haveIn other age constructions, u and vbi do not alternate. Instead, the u form appears in
sentence final position, while its direct object nominal occupies focus position.(103) a. íkpé ékà       lí ú / í ù?
         year quantity PF you I PAP.do

         year quantity PF they PAP.do
         ‘How old are they?’8.2.3 Intransitive uIntransitive u has the sense ‘do.’ When it occurs with a manner adjunct such as
lèsèn ‘well,’ ìyó ‘that way’ or ìná ‘this way,’ it contributes to construction sense ‘act,
behave, perform.’ Noun phrase and verb phrase properties in intransitive u con-
structions are partially constrained. It is the case, however, that intransitive u shows
polarity and mood potential and allows discourse repositioning of its arguments.(104) a. ólí óvbèkhàn ú          lèsèn.
         the youth      PRP.do well
        ‘The youth acted / performed / behaved / did well.’

         the youth      PRP.do PMD
         ‘The youth has acted / performed this way / did so.’     Intransitive u constructions do not constrain polarity and mood. They appear as
imperatives (ù ìyó [do DMD] ‘Act that way’), prohibitives (é è ú ìyó [you PR do DMD]
‘Don't act that way’), negative statements (ólì òkpòsò í ì ù ìyó [the woman SC NEG do
DMD] ‘The woman did not act that way’), and polar interrogatives (ólí ókpósó ú' ìyó?
[the woman PAP.do DMD] ‘Did the woman perform / act that way?’).
     The initial noun phrase in intransitive u constructions reveals subject proper-
ties. It permits nominative pronouns for each person and number. Even the indefi-
nite subject pronoun is admitted, although only with imperfect aspect.(105) ì / ù / ò ú            ìyó.    /     á à ù ìyó.

ternal syntactic shape. They allow human nouns, proper (àlèkè) and common
(óvbèkhàn), as well as nonhuman animate nouns (áwà). Except for proper nouns,
each requires elaboration by, for instance, the definite article. Bare common nouns
are unacceptable. Intransitive u subject rejects inanimate common nouns, even
when definite (*ólí ópíá ú' ìyó ‘The cutlass performed that way’).(106) a. áléké ú'       ìyó.

khán nóí ú' ìyó [youth next PAP.do DMD] ‘The next youth acted that way’), existen-

that way’) and e.g. collective èvèvá (ívbékhán èvèvá ú' ìyó [youths both PAP.do DMD]
‘Both youths acted that way’). Intransitive u subjects reject kindred élìyó and ódàn.
     Intransitive u subject position allows most impersonal pronouns: demonstrative
deictic ònà (ònà ú ìná [this.one PRP.do PMD] ‘This one acted this way’) as well as
deictic óáín and contrastive ónóí (ónóí / óáín ú' ìyó [next.one that.one PAP.do DMD]
‘The next one / That one acted that way’), universal quantifiers collective èrèmé and
distributive òdóòdé (èrèmé / òdóòdé ú' ìyó [all each.one PAP.do DMD] ‘All / Each one

ódàn.
    Intransitive u subject and adjunct positions correspond to constituents in dis-
course defined positions. Subject corresponds to a focus li/ni or a topic constituent.(107) a. ólí ómòhè lí ó ú'            ìyó.

         the man he PRP.do DMD
         ‘As for the man, he acted that way.’Manner adjuncts with intransitive u occupy focus position provided Manner preverb
i/e precedes u in the matrix clause. Intransitive u manner-demonstrative adjuncts
never assume topic position.(108) ìyó lí ólí ómóhé í'             ù.
      DMD PF the man PAP.MAN do
      ‘It was that way that the man acted.’Intransitive u grammatical positions correspond to distinct interrogative pronouns.
Subjects correspond only to interrogative pronoun óé'. Adjuncts correspond to
manner questions framed by ébé'...i. Responses require a manner constituent in situ,
not in focus position.(109) a. óé' ó ú'         ìyó?

expression of verb phrase properties. Although intransitive u disallows verbal affix-
es, it selectively occurs with inflection, auxiliary, preverb, postverbal particle and
temporal adjunct categories. Relative to verbal affixes, intransitive u accepts neither
Perseverative Ci-, Factative -i nor Distributive -lo/lo/no (*élí ímòhè ú-ló ìyó [the men

kha (ó khà ú ìyó [he PAP.HYP act DMD] ‘He would have acted that way’), Concessive

(ó zá' ú ìyó [he PAP.RES act DMD] ‘As a result, he acted that way’). No other epistem-
ic forms occur, particularly speculative Dubitatives vba and bia, and Certaintive ma.
     In a more severe fashion, intransitive u restrains relative tense. It rejects Subse-
quent kpe, and Anterior ke, as unacceptable ke suggests (*ó ké' ú ìyó [he PAP.ANT

     Intransitive u limits preverbs. It disallows manner-demonstrative preverbs ìná
and ìyó. With aspectualizers, intransitive u permits some phasal forms, permitting
Repetitive che (ò chéè ú ìyó [he PRP.REP do DMD] ‘He acted that way again’) and
Additive gbo (ò gbóò ú ìyó [he PRP.ADD do DMD] ‘He acted that way too’) but not
Durative se or Punctual ghe. Intransitive u allows only the boundary aspectualizer
Past Absolute ya (ólí ómóhé yà ú ìyó [the man PAP.PA do DMD] ‘The man used to act
that way’). It rejects Past Absolute mo, Ingressive ya, Egressive mo and Conative òó.
     Intransitive u admits only one evaluative preverb, kuku (ólí ómóhé kú'kù ú ìyó
[the man PAP.POEV do DMD] ‘The man afterall acted that way’). It rejects duu ‘for no
reason’ and woo ‘instead.’
470 | Be, do, happen and have     Relative to remaining preverbs, intransitive u accepts only a few. It allows one
temporal preverb, kpao (ólí ómóhé kpá'ò ú ìyó [man PAP.earlier do DMD] ‘The man
acted that way earlier on’), and two subject attributive forms, dóbo (ólí ómóhé dó'bò
ú ìyó [the man PAP.mistakenly do DMD] ‘The man mistakenly acted that way’) and
gbúdu (ólí ómóhé gbú'dù ú ìyó [the man PAP.courageously do DMD] ‘The man coura-
geously acted that way’). It disallows temporal bobo ‘promptly,’ tua ‘hurriedly’ and
gue ‘unexpectedly’ as well as subject attributives dábo ‘deliberately,’ miti ‘able,’
dúda ‘defiantly,’ kekégbe ‘perseveringly,’ dégbe ‘carefully,’ and totóbo ‘intensely.’
     Intransitive u restricts quantity preverbs as well. It accepts Emphatic Reflexive
dobo (ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì ú ìyó [the man PAP.REFL him do DMD] ‘The man himself
acted that way’) and Collective gba (élí ímóhé gbá' ú ìyó [the men PAP.COL do DMD]
‘The men together acted that way’). However, intransitive u rejects Absolute Intensi-
fier zemi and Nonabsolute Intensifier zeze.
     Relative to postverbal forms, intransitive u constructions are generally more tol-
erant. Intransitive u permits a temporal particle as well as deictic adverbs. It allows
Temporal Perspective lee but not Temporal Degree gbe (ólí ókpósó ú' ìyó léé / *gbé
[the woman PAP.do DMD TEMP much] ‘The woman acted that way already / fin-
ished acting that way’). With appropriate inflection, intransitive u accepts deictic
adjuncts for past (òdè), recent past (èghéènà), future (ákhò), immediate present
(ènyáà) and, with adjunct modification, ‘today’ (éènà).(111) a. ólí ókpósó ú'        ìyó òdè.

         ‘The woman acted that way yesterday.’

properties that refer to event intensity or sound. Ideophonic forms thus appear to
ascribe a property to an event rather than to a nominal referent. Constructions de-
fined by u and ideophones inflect only for Past perfect.(112) a. ólí ákhé ú'          bèkhé.
         the pot PAP.do waveringly

         the tree PAP.do thud.sound
         ‘The tree thudded / did a thud.’Information questions corresponding to u ideophone subjects are framed by émé'
‘what.’ Responses require the subject in situ, not as a simple noun phrase.(113) émé' ó ú'        bìán?
      what it PAP.do flashingly
      ‘What flashed? / What did a flash?’

      ‘The sky flashed.’8.3 ‘happen’ verbs
The verb u with sense ‘happen’ occurs in transitive and intransitive constructions.
Each construction exhibits highly restricted syntactic patterns.(114) a. émí ósò       í ì     ù        ólí ómòhè.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to the man
         ‘Nothing happened to the man.’
472 | Be, do, happen and have      b. ò kéè         ú,      ó vá'rè.
         it PRP.ANT happen he PAP.come
         ‘After it happened, he came.’8.3.1 Intransitive uIntransitive u ‘happen’ is limited to subordinate clauses and information questions.
It occurs in subordinate ke clauses.(115) ò kéè         ú         wèé,      ólí ókpósó ó'     vbì ìwè.
      it PRP.ANT happen short.time the woman PAP.enter LOC house
      ‘After a bit of time, the woman entered the house.’In information questions, intransitive u is preceded by interrogative pronoun émé'.
The Factative suffix -ì in these constructions is disallowed.(116) émé' ó ú'          / *ú-ì?
      what it PAP.happen    happen-F
      ‘What happened?’Responses to intransitive u ‘happen’ information questions restrict predication type.
They permit change of locative state predicates (de ‘fall’) but not caused change of
state predicates, for example gbe a ‘break’ (*ólí ómòhè gbé ákhè á [the man
PRP.break pot CS] ‘The man broke a pot’) or stative ri ‘be’ (*ólí ómòhè ríì vbí ìwè [the
man PRP.be LOC house] ‘The man is in the house’).(117) émé' ó ú'?
      what it PAP.happen
      ‘What happened?’
      ìtásà lí ó dé'             rè.
      plate PF it PAP.fall arrive
      ‘It is a plate that fell.’8.3.2 Transitive uTransitive u ‘happen’ constructions are syntactically rigid. They require predicate
negation, the noun émì as subject position head and an animate noun as direct ob-
ject. Transitive u ‘happen’ has no corresponding affirmative.
                                                                 ‘happen’ verbs | 473(118) a. émí ósò       í   ì   ù          ólí ómòhè.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to the man
         ‘Nothing happened to the man.’
      b. *émí ósò        ú            ólí ómòhè.
          thing certain PRP.happen.to the man
          ‘Something happened to the man.’Transitive ‘happen’ constructions accept not only Perfect Negation but also Prospec-
tive Negation with kha. Otherwise, they do not inflect for prospective aspect (*émí
ósó ló ù ólí ómòhè [thing certain PRED happen.to the man] ‘Something will happen
to the man’, *émí ósò ló ù ólí ómòhè [thing certain ANTI happen.to the man] ‘Noth-
ing is about to happen to the man’).(119) émí ósò       í khà        ù      ólí ómòhè.
      thing certain SC PRONEG happen.to the man
      ‘Nothing will happen to the man.’    Transitive u ‘happen’ fails to accept any auxiliaries or preverbs, as suggested by
the unacceptability of epistemic Certaintive ma (*émí ósò máà ù ólí ómòhè [thing
certain PRP.CER happen.to the man] ‘Something surely happened to the man’) and
evaluative preverb kuku (*émí ósò kúkù ù ólí ómòhè [thing certain PRP.POEV hap-
pen.to the man] ‘Something after all happened to the man’).
    Transitive ‘happen’ constructions confine the shape of their initial noun phrase.
They require noun émì ‘thing’ modified by existential quantifier ósò. No other post-
determiner is acceptable, i.e. demonstrative, numeral or kindred. As well, transitive
‘happen’ rejects noun émì when modified by an associative phrase, attributive
phrase or relative clause.(120) émí ósò       í ì    ù         ólí ómòhè.
      thing certain SC NEG happen.to the man
      ‘Nothing happened to the man.’Morever, three additional negative properties characterize transitive u’s initial noun
phrase. This position does not accept nominative pronouns. Neither first person
singular/plural (í/má) nor third person (ó, íyàìn) is acceptable. It is therefore primar-
ily word order that identifies subject position in transitive ‘happen’ constructions.(121) *ó / íyàìn ì        ù          ólí ómòhè.
       it     they NEG happen.to the man
       ‘It / They did not happen to the man.’
474 | Be, do, happen and haveThe initial noun phrase with transitive u rejects proper names, common nouns vary-
ing in animacy (òkpòsò, áwà, ópìà) or common nouns with a pre- or postdeterminer.(122) a. *àlèkè / ólì òkpòsò í ì         ù         ólí ómòhè.
          Aleke the woman SC NEG happen.to the man
          ‘Aleke / The woman did not happen to the man.’
      b. *ólí áwà / ópìà       í ì     ù          ólí ómòhè.
          the dog cutlass SC NEG happen.to the man
          ‘The dog / cutlass did not happen to the man.’In addition, the initial nominal position with transitive u does not admit any imper-
sonal pronouns. One does not find, for instance, demonstrative óáìn or kindred élìyó
(*óáìn / élìyó í ì ù ólí ómòhè [that.one that.kind SC NEG happen.to the man] ‘That one
/ That kind of thing did not happen to the man’), numeral èvá or èvèvá (*èvá / èvèvá
í ì ù ólí ómòhè [two both SC NEG happen.to the man] ‘Two / Both did not happen to
the man’) or existential ósò or óvbèé (*ósò / óvbèé í ì ù ólí ómòhè [certain.one anoth-
er.one SC NEG happen.to the man] ‘Nothing / Nothing else happened to the man’).
      As for the nominal position following transitive u ‘happen,’ it is not as restricted
as initial position. It permits a range of NPs and requires their syntactic elaboration.
Post-u noun phrase position accepts accusative pronouns across person and num-
ber categories, and it permits human proper nouns.(123) a. émí ósò       í   ì  ù           óì / mè / vbà.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to him me you
         ‘Nothing happened to him / me / you.’
      b. émí ósò       í ì     ù           àlèkè.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to Aleke
         ‘Nothing happened to Aleke.’As direct object, post-u position allows human (óvbèkhàn) and nonhuman animate
(áwà) nouns designated as definite, by, for example, predeterminer ólí. However, it
disallows inanimate nouns (ópìà). Bare common noun direct objects, regardless of
animacy, are unacceptable (*émí ósò í ì ù ólí ópìà / ópìà [thing certain SC NEG hap-
pen.to the cutlass cutlass] ‘Nothing happened to the / a cutlass’).(124) a. émí ósò       í ì    ù           ólí óvbèkhàn / *óvbèkhàn.

ers. Allowed are demonstrative deictic nà and áìn (émí ósò í ì ù ólí áwá áìn / ólí áwá
nà [thing certain SC NEG happen.to the dog that the dog this] ‘Nothing happened to
that / this dog’) as well as contrastive nóì (émí ósò í ì ù áwá nóì [thing certain SC NEG
happen.to dog next] ‘Nothing happened to the next dog’), and quantifiers, e.g. uni-
versal collective èrèmé and existential partitive ósò (émí ósò í ì ù áwá èrèmé / áwá
ósò [thing certain SC NEG happen.to dog all dog certain] ‘Nothing happened to all
the dogs / to a certain dog’). Excluded from u direct object position are numerals,
e.g. cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá as well as kindred forms, deictic élìyó and
contrastive ódàn.
     Transitive u direct object position allows most impersonal pronouns: demon-
stratives ònà, óáìn and ónóì, universal quantifiers, collective èrèmé and distributive
òdóòdé, as well as existential quantifiers, partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé (émí
ósò í ì ù óáìn / ònóì / *èvá / *élìyó [thing certain SC NEG happen.to that.one next.one
two one.that.kind] ‘Nothing happened to that one / the next one’). Rejected in direct
object position are numerals such as cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá and kindred
forms, deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn.
     Transitive u ‘happen’ noun phrases allow for repositioning to discourse defined
positions. u subject corresponds to a li/ni focus constituent but not a topic (*émí lí ó
ú' érá íyàìn, ó ló gbò ú íyàìn [thing R it PAP.happen.to father their it PRED ADD hap-
pen.to them] ‘As for the thing that happened to their father, it will happen to them

      thing R it PAP.happen.to father their
          lí ó ló      gbò ú        íyàìn.
          PF it PRED ADD happen them
      ‘The thing that happened to their father will also happen to them.’In information questions, transitive u subject corresponds to interrogative pronoun
émé'. Habitual aspect is obligatory in the question. Responses require a verb other
than u inflected for Habitual aspect.(126) émé' ó ò ú             òjè?
      what it H happen.to Oje
      ‘What happens to Oje?’
      ó ò khònmé.
      he H become.sick
      ‘He becomes sick.’
476 | Be, do, happen and haveIn contrast, transitive u direct object corresponds to a topic constituent but not a
focus li/ni constituent (*ólí ómóhé nà lí émí ósò í ì ù [the man this PF thing certain SC
NEG happen.to] ‘It was this man that nothing happened to’). In addition, transitive
u direct objects never correspond to an interrogative pronoun, e.g. óé' in (*óé' émí
ósò í ì ù? [who thing certain SC NEG happen.to] ‘Whom did nothing happen to?’).(127) ólí ómòhè, émí ósò         í ì    ù         óì.

      ‘As for the man, nothing happened to him.’8.3.3 Intransitive ruanAlong with intransitive u ‘happen,’ Emai has a verb ruan ‘happen.’ It is limited to
intransitive constructions, failing in transitives (*ébè rúán ólí ómòhè ‘A calamity
happened to the man’).(128) ébè       rúán-ì.
      calamity PRP.happen-F
      ‘A calamity happened.’Intransitive ruan occurs in émé' ‘what’ information questions. Responses require
caused change of state (gbe) or change of state (de) verb.(129) émé' ó rúán'-ì?
      what it PAP.happen-F
      ‘What happened?’

      ‘A car killed a person.’          ‘The basket fell.’     Intransitive ruan occurs in series with allative verb ye and its human direct ob-
ject, although only in information questions.(130) émé' ó rúán'        yé      ólí ómòhè / *ólí óràn?
      what it PAP.happen move.to the man       the tree
      ‘What happened to the man?’Predicate ruan ye shows information questions with émé' ‘what’ corresponding to
subject position; responses require a change of state verb (u ‘die’).

      ó ú'-ì.
      he PAP.die-F
      ‘He died.’    As a point of comparison, the verbs ruan and u are not interchangeable. ruan
appears limited to calamitous events that are permanent or irreversible, as suggest-
ed by acceptable ruan, not u, with subject noun ébè ‘calamity.’(132) a. ébè       rúán-ì.

          calamity PRP.happen happen-F
          ‘A calamity happened.’In addition, information questions with ruan and u do not invite equivalent re-
sponses. ruan requires permanent u ‘die’ but not temporary khonme ‘become sick’ as
response. Intransitive u, conversely, requires a temporary, not a permanent event.(133) émé' ó rúán'        yé        ólí óvbèkhàn?

The verb u ‘do’ collocates with direct object nominals to express a variety of cultural
judgments. English translations vary across ‘perform/execute,’ ‘commit/be guilty’ or
478 | Be, do, happen and have‘be engaged/immersed in,’ as the samples below suggest. Each u construction will

object ábò ‘divination’ and an obligatory locative vbi phrase. This construction re-
quires Conative preverb òó. It rejects simple perfect and imperfect aspect.(136) ólí ómòhè ó ó'      ù ábó          vbì òkè.

                                              Performance collocations with ‘do’ | 479     Constructions with u ábò severely constrain polarity and mood. They fail as
negative statements, imperatives or prohibitives. They are found as polar questions
(ólí ómòhè ó ó' ù ábó vbì òkè? [the man SC CON do divination LOC Oke] ‘Did the man
go to perform divination in Oke?’).
     Noun phrases in u ábò collocations limit correspondence to discourse defined
positions. Subject position corresponds to a li/ni marked focus constituent, a topic
constituent or an interrogative pronoun (óé'). Neither direct object nor locative ob-
ject exhibit similar grammatical possibilities.(137) a. ólí ómóhé nà lí ó ó' ù ábó                  vbì òkè.

veys the sense ‘provide/give assistance to.’ This construction inflects only for Pre-
sent and Past perfect, never imperfect aspect.(138) a. òjè ú        ìkhòbó     lí    àlèkè.

object in verb series (òjè ré ólí éghó' ú ìkhòbó lí àlèkè [Oje PRP.use the money do

     Collocations with u ìdàmìghé inflect for Past and Present perfect but not imper-
fect Habitual or Continuous. In the Habitual, however, there exists an alternation
where manner adjunct precedes prepositional vbi phrase.(141) a. ólí ómòhè ú        ólì ìdàmìghé lèsèn.

atives or prohibitives.
     Noun phrases in u ìdàmìghé lèsèn collocations generally correspond to dis-
course defined positions. Subject corresponds to li/ni focus or topic but not to an
interrogative pronoun (óé'). However, subject in syntactically reduced collocations

constitutent (*ébé' ólí ómóhé í' ú ólì ìdàmìghé? [how the man PAP.MAN do the exam]
‘How did the man do on the exam?’).8.4.4 u óhà / u ódònThe verb u collocates with ódòn ‘husband’ or óhà ‘wife’ and either of the adjuncts
chéchéché or lèsèn to convey sense ‘act, behave or perform toward / treat one’s

         she H do husband her well
         ‘She acts toward / performs toward / treats well her husband.’     Collocations with u óhá and u ódòn restrict polarity and mood. In the imperative
they require Ingressive ya (yà ú ódón ó lèsèn [IG do husband your well] ‘Get on with
/ Start treating your husband well’, yà ú ódón ó chéchéché [IG do husband your ap-
propriately] ‘Start acting toward your husband in an appropriate fashion’). They fail
as prohibitives.
     u óhá/ódòn collocations are acceptable as polar interrogatives (áléké ó ò ù ódón

husband?’, áléké ó ò ù ódón óí chéchéché? [Aleke SC H do husband her appropriate-
ly] ‘Does Aleke act toward her husband appropriately?’). But they fail as negatives.
     Noun phrase positions in u óhá/ódòn collocations appear in discourse defined
positions. Subject corresponds to a li/ni focus or topic constituent. It does not corre-
spond to an interrogative pronoun like óé' (*óé' ó ò ù ódón óí chéchéché? [who she H

stituent in topic or focus position (*òdón óí lí áléké ó ò ù chéchéché [husband her PF
Aleke SC H do appropriately] ‘It is her husband that Aleke treats appropriately’). As
well, adjuncts in ‘treat’ collocations fail to correspond to an interrogative pronoun
or to assume topic or focus position (*chéchéché lí áléké ó ò ù ódón óì [appropriately
PF Aleke SC H do husband her] ‘It is appropriately that Aleke treats her husband’).

         ‘As for the man, he committed a bad thing against me.’The émí lì òbè phrase, whether in a monotransitive or double object construction,
appears in li/ni focus position but not in topic position. Also, émí lì òbè has no corre-
sponding interrogative pronoun.(161) a. émí lì òbè lí ólí ómóhé ú'-ì.

not li/ni focus position. In information questions, first object does not correspond to
an interrogative pronoun either.(162) àlèkè, ólí ómóhé ú'       óí émí lì òbè.

490 | Be, do, happen and have8.4.7 u èsèn / u òbèThe verb u collocates with a direct object consisting of either evaluative noun èsèn
‘good’ or òbè ‘bad’ modified by the definite predeterminer. Collocations of this type
exhibit limited polarity and mood potential. They appear as negative statements,
never as affirmative statements. The u ólì èsèn and u ólì òbè collocations also never
appear as polar questions, imperatives or prohibitives. In addition, neither u ólì èsèn
nor u ólì òbè inflects for perfect or imperfect aspect.(163) a. ólí ómòhè í ì       ù ólì èsèn.

         the man SC NEG do the bad.one
         ‘The man did not do the bad thing.’     Noun phrase positions in u ólì èsèn and u ólì òbè constructions relate to dis-
course positions in a restricted fashion.18 Subject never corresponds to a li/ni focus
constituent (*ólí ómòhè nà li ó ì ù ólì òbè [the man this PF he NEG do the bad.one] ‘It
was this man who did not do the bad thing’), topic constituent (*ólí ómòhè nà, ó ì ù
ólì òbè [the man this he NEG do the bad.one] ‘As for this man, he did not do the bad
thing’) or interrogative pronoun (*óé' ó ì ù ólì èsèn? [who he NEG do the good.one]
‘Who did not do the good thing?’). Direct object position behaves similarly. It never
corresponds to a focus constituent (*ólì èsèn li ólí ómòhè í ì ù [the good.one PF the
man SC NEG do] ‘It was the good thing that the man did not do’), topic constituent
(*ólì èsèn, ólí ómòhè í ì ù óì [the good.one the man SC NEG do it] ‘As for the good

tion to convey situations unwelcome in village life. In these constructions, u in the
Habitual has the sense ‘engage/immerse in.’ Such collocations never appear in per-
fect aspect or imperfect Continuous.(164) a. ólí ókpósó ó ò ù èó.

     d. ójé ó ò ù ìgúó.
        Oje SC H do crookedness
        ‘Oje engages in unsavory acts / in crooked dealings.’     u constructions with sense ‘engage in’ limit polarity and mood. They appear as
prohibitives (é è kè ú èmòì [you PR ANT do gossip] ‘Don't gossip anymore’, é è kè ú
òvbéé' [you PR ANT do intrigues] ‘Don't plan intrigues anymore’) but not as impera-
tives. Constructions with u ‘engage in’ occur as polar interrogatives (ólí ókpósó ó ò ù
èó? [the woman SC H do gossip] ‘Is the woman guilty of gossip?’, ójé ó ò ù èmòì? [Oje
SC H do issues] ‘Is Oje guilty of gossip?’) and negative statements (ólì òkpòsò í yà ù
èó [the woman SC PANEG do gossip] ‘The woman never gossips’, òjè í yà ù èmòì [Oje
SC PANEG do issues] ‘Oje never gossips’). Negative statements for these construc-
tions require Past Absolute Negation yà.
     Noun phrase positions in u ‘engage in’ constructions differentially restrict their
relations to discourse positions. Subject corresponds to a topic constituent but not a
li/ni focus constituent. In addition, subject corresponds to interrogative pronoun
(óé') in questions with an obligatory partitive vbi phrase (vbí úsèé ísì ìyáín). Even
more limited is direct object, which corresponds to neither interrogative pronoun,
topic constituent nor focus constituent, e.g. (*èó lí ólí ókpósó ó ò ù [gossip PF the
woman SC H do] ‘It was gossip that the woman engaged in’).(165) a. ólí ókpósó nà, ó ò ù èó.

collocation is limited to Continuous aspect, rejecting imperfect Habitual and both
forms of the perfect. The noun phrase following u in this collocation never allows
definite article ólí/élí or any postdeterminer.
492 | Be, do, happen and have(166) òjè ò ó ù àgbòn.
      Oje SC C do life
      ‘Oje is enjoying / engaging in / conducting his life with vigor.’     u àgbòn constructions restrict mood and polarity. They appear as imperatives,
although Ingressive ya is required (yà ú ágbón ísì èé [IG do life ASS your] ‘Get on
with your life / Start living your life’). They never appear as prohibitives, negative
statements or polar questions.
     Noun phrases in u àgbòn constructions restrict repositioning in discourse. Sub-
ject fails to correspond to a li/ni focus constituent, topic constituent or interrogative
pronoun such as óé' (*óé' ó ò ù àgbòn? [who he H do life] ‘Who is enjoying life?).
Likewise, àgbòn never appears in topic or focus position or corresponds to an inter-
rogative pronoun.8.4.10 u úkpèThe verb u collocates with noun úkpè ‘festival’ to express ‘celebrate or execute a
festival.’ This collocation is restricted to Past and Present perfect and Continuous
imperfect. u úkpè rejects imperfect Habitual.(167) a. áfúzé' ú'       úkpè     léé.

         ‘They have executed a festival already / celebrated already.’Direct object úkpè allows definite article ólí and postdeterminers (è ú ólí úkpè léé
[they PRP.do the festival TEMP] ‘They celebrated / did the festival already’).
    Constructions with u úkpè constrain polarity and mood. They never appear as
imperatives or negative statements. They occur as prohibitives, with obligatory
plural subject (vbá è / *é è kè ú úkpé ísì àgágán' [you PR you PR ANT do festival ASS

course. Subject does not correspond to a li/ni focus constituent, topic constituent or

sense ‘act or behave in a manly/womanly fashion,’ respectively. Neither noun ac-
cepts definite article ólí/élí or any postdeterminer and retains its abstract
‘male/female’ sense.(170) a. érá    vbà ú        ómòhè.

peratives, prohibitives, polar interrogatives and negative statements, as unaccepta-
ble negatives indicate (*ínyó vbà í ì ù òkpòsò [mother your SC NEG do womanhood]

     Noun phrase positions in u ómòhè/òkpòsò collocations have limited discourse
repositioning potential. Subject does not corefer to an interrogative pronoun, topic
constituent or li/ni focus constituent (*ínyó vbà lí ó ú' òkpòsò [mother your PF she

ómòhè/òkpòsò occurs in li/ni focus position but not topic position (*òkpòsò, ínyó vbá

     ‘It was womanly the way your mother acted.’8.5 Resemblance verbs
Constructions expressing similarity and resemblance between entities are shaped by
Emai verbs u ‘seem’ and re ‘take after.’ Each accepts a following bi ‘like’ phrase: NP
u bi NP and NP ree bi NP. Behavioral similarity is required for u bi and perceptual
similarity for re bi.20(173) a. ólí ómòhè úù          bí érá       óì.

         the youth      PRP.take.after like father his
         ‘The youth resembles his father / takes after his father.’
                                                              Resemblance verbs | 4958.5.1 Behavioral u biu bi constructions with the sense ‘seem like’ express behavioral, nonphysical re-
semblance. They compare referents articulated as grammatical subject and bi com-
plement. These constructions constrain inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs, the
syntactic shape of their noun phrases, and their potential for expressing polarity
and mood.
     Constructions with u bi restrict mood and polarity expression. They are found as
negative statements (ólí ómò í ì úù bí ómòhè [the child SC NEG seem like male] ‘The
child does not seem like a male’). They never occur as polar interrogatives, impera-
tives or prohibitives.
     Predicate u in construction with bi does not tend to exhibit properties typically
associated with verbs. It limits inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. u bi severely
restricts auxiliaries and preverbs. It rejects deontic, epistemic, and relative tense
auxiliaries. As well, it excludes all preverbs, including aspectualizers, evaluatives,
temporals, subject attributives, quantities and manner deictics. Relative to inflec-
tion, u bi permits Present perfect in an irregular fashion, since high low tone on the
verb itself is atypical. It does not inflect for Past perfect, prospective aspect or imper-
fect aspect.(174) ólí ómòhè úù          bí érá óì.
      the man PRP.seem like father his
      ‘The man seems like his father.’      Noun phrase positions framed by u bi differentially restrict NP type, animacy
and syntactic shape. Initial position, as subject, accepts nominative pronouns (e.g.
o, i). Nonetheless, it does not allow indefinite subject pronoun a.(175) a. ò / *à úù            bí émèlúgbó.
         it one PRP.seem like bush.cow
         ‘It seems like a bush cow.’
      b. ì úù          bí érá     mè.
         I PRP.seem like father my
         ‘I seem like my father.’Subject position in u bi constructions accepts proper names of person but not place.(176) òhí úù         bí érá óì. / *áfúzé' úù         bí èdó.
      Ohi PRP.seem like father his Afuze PRP.seem like Benin.City
      ‘Ohi seems like his father.’ ‘Afuze seems like Benin City.’
496 | Be, do, happen and haveSubjects of u bi accept common nouns, regardless of animacy. However, common
nouns occur only under a definiteness condition, as shown by definite article ólí.(177) a. ólí óvbèkhàn / *óvbèkhàn úù           bí émèlúgbó.

         the cup cup PRP.seem like gourd
         ‘The cup seems like a gourd.’     Subject position in u bi constructions accepts a range of postdeterminers:
demonstratives nà and áìn (ólí óvbékhán nà / áìn úù bí érá óì [the youth this that
PRP.seem like father his] ‘This / That youth seems like his father’) as well as nóì
(óvbékhán nóì úù bí ólí ó ò khònmé [youth next PRP.seem like one he H become.sick]
‘The next youth seems like the one who is sick’), universal quantifiers collective
èrèmé ((élí) ívbékhán èrèmé úù bí élí yán à khònmé [the youths all PRP.seem like

èvèvá úù bí élí óhánmí ó ò gbé [youths each all.two PRP.seem like ones hunger SC H
beat] ‘Each of the / Both youths seem like the ones who were overcome with hun-
ger’), existential quantifiers, partitive ésò and contrastive évbèé, (ívbékhán ésò /
évbèé úù bí élí óhánmí ó ò gbé [youths certain other PRP.seem like ones hunger SC H
beat] ‘Certain / Other youths seem like the ones who were overcome with hunger’)
and cardinal numerals, e.g. èvá ((élí) ívbèkhàn èvá úù bí élí yán à khònmé [the
youths two PRP.seem like ones they H become.sick] ‘The two youths seem like the
ones who are sick’). Disallowed are kindred deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn.
     Subjects of u bi also accept impersonal pronouns21: demonstratives such as deic-
tic óáìn (óáìn úù bí ólì ó ò khònmé [that.one PRP.seem like one he H become.sick]
‘That one seems like one who is sick’) and contrastive ónóì (ónóì úù bí óhánmí ó ò
gbé [next.one PRP.seem like one hunger SC H beat] ‘The next one seems like one
overcome with hunger / like one beat by hunger’), universal quantifiers collective
èrèmé (èrèmé úù bí élí óhánmí ó ò gbé [all PRP.seem like ones hunger SC H beat] ‘All
seem like ones overcome with hunger’) and distributive òdóòdé (òdóòdé úù bí ólí
óhánmí ó ò gbé [each PRP.seems like one hunger SC H beat] ‘Each one seems like

óvbèé, (ósò / óvbèé úù bí ólì ó ò khònmé [certain.one another.one PRP.seem like one
he H become.sick] ‘A certain one / Another one seems like ones overcome with hun-
ger’) in addition to cardinal and collective numerals such as èvá and èvèvá (èvá vbì ò
                                                           Resemblance verbs | 497/ èvèvá úù bí élí óhánmí ó ò gbé [two LOC it all.two PRP.seem like ones hunger SC H
beat] ‘Two of them / both of them seem like ones overcome with hunger’). Cardinal
forms also appear as subjects when head of a partitive vbi phrase. Disallowed in
subject position are kindred pronouns (deictic élìyó, contrastive ódàn).
    Complements of bi are more severely constrained with respect to NP type, ani-
macy and syntactic shape. They accept bare common nouns that are human
(òkpòsò), animate (émèlúgbó), or inanimate (ùbèlè).(178) a. ólí óvbékhán nà úù            bí òkpòsò.

         ‘This youth seems like a female.’

         ‘The goat seems like a bush cow.’
      c. ólí úkó' úù          bí ùbèlè.
         the cup PRP.seem like gourd
         ‘The cup seems like a gourd.’bi complements allow proper nouns of person.(179) ólí ómòhè úù         bí òhí.
      the man PRP.seem like Ohi
      ‘The man seems like Ohi.’     However, bi complements resist determiners and pronouns. As bi complement,
a personal pronoun is unacceptable. bi complements also reject impersonal pro-
nouns such as demonstrative óáìn22 (*ólí éwè úù bí óáìn [the goat PRP.seem like
that.one] ‘The goat seems like that one’). As for determiners, bi complement position
excludes nouns with definite predeterminer ólí (*ólí éwè úù bí ólí émèlúgbó [the goat
PRP.seem like the bush.cow] ‘The goat seems like the bush cow’), an additional
postdeterminer such as demonstrative áìn (*ólí éwè úù bí ólí émèlúgbó áìn [the goat
PRP.seem like the bush.cow that] ‘The goat seems like that bush cow’) and kindred
élìyó (*ólí éwè úù bí émèlúgbó élìyó [the goat PRP.seem like bush.cow that.kind] ‘The
goat seems like a bush cow of that kind’).
     Noun phrase positions in u bi constructions limit relations to discourse defined
positions. Subject does not correspond to a li/ni focus constituent, topic constituent
or interrogative pronoun.(180) *ólí ómóhé nà lí ó úù                bí érá  óì.
       the man this PF he PRP.seem like father his

498 | Be, do, happen and haveComplements of bi similarly fail to correspond to a constituent in focus or topic
position, or to an interrogative pronoun.(181) *érá    óì lí ólí ómòhè úù        bí.
       father his PF the man PRP.seem like
       ‘The man seems like his father.’8.5.2 Perceptual ree biConstructions framed by ree bi express physical resemblance between two entities.
They compare referents articulated as grammatical subject and bi complement. The
resulting constructions show more severe syntactic limitations than u bi.
     ree bí constructions limit inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. They disallow any
deontic, epistemic or relative tense auxiliary. Likewise, ree bí constructions reject
preverbs, regardless of class: aspectualizer, evaluative, temporal, subject attribu-
tive, quantity and manner-demonstrative. Their subject phrase shows the tone pat-
tern of Present perfect (right edge low tone). The high low tone on the predicate is
atypical but similar to locative ri tone. With prototypic verbs, high low tone in Pre-
sent perfect is limited to auxiliaries and preverbs. ree bí constructions never appear
in the Past perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(182) a. ólí óvbèkhàn réè             bí érá      óì.
         the youth     PRP.take.after like father his
         ‘The youth physically resembles / takes after his father.’
      b. ólì òkpòsò réè             bí ómòhè.
         the woman PRP.take.after like male
         ‘The woman is masculine.’     Constructions with ree bi severely restrict polarity and mood. They fail as nega-
tive statements, polar interrogatives, imperatives and prohibitives, as unacceptable
negatives suggest (*ólí óvbèkhàn í ì rèè bí érá óì [the youth SC NEG take.after like
father his] ‘The youth doesn’t resemble his father’).
     Noun phrase positions linked to ree bi manifest contrasting grammatical prop-
erties. Each restricts NP type, animacy and syntactic shape. The initial noun phrase
in ree bi constructions accepts nominative pronouns (e.g. o). It thus serves as
grammatical subject. However, it rejects the indefinite subject pronoun (a).(183) ò / *à réè               bí òhí.
      he one PRP.take.after like Ohi
      ‘He physically resembles Ohi.’

versal quantifiers (collective èrèmé, distributive òdóòdé) and numerals (cardinal
èvá, collective èvèvá).
     Noun phrase positions framed by ree bi restrict discourse repositioning of con-
stituents. Subject fails to correspond to a li/ni focus constituent, topic constituent or
interrogative pronoun. Similarly, bi complement position never corresponds to a
focus or topic constituent, or an interrogative pronoun.(189) a. *òjè òkpá lí ó réè                  bí ólí ómòhè.
          Oje alone PF he PAP.take.after like the man
          ‘It was Oje alone who resembles the man.’
      b. *ólí ómóhé nà lí ójé réè                bí.
          the man this PF Oje PAP.take.after like
          ‘It is this man that Oje resembles.’8.6 ‘have’ verb
The verb moe ‘have’ articulates relations of possession, either alienable or inaliena-
ble. It also translates English ‘own’ and ‘belong to.’25 Canonical moe constructions
frame two noun phrase positions and associated semantic roles: subject possessor
and direct object possessum. These constructions are limited as to overall syntactic
shape, including noun phrase exponents and verbal properties.(190) a. àlèkè mòè         àmágò.
         Aleke PRP.have mango
         ‘Aleke has a mango.’
      b. àlèkè mòè         ómò.
         Aleke PRP.have child
         ‘Aleke has a child.’
      c. ì mòè        óbò.
         I PRP.have hand
         ‘I have a hand.’
502 | Be, do, happen and haveNot all possession relations are expressed by moe constructions. Possession rela-
tions found in English predications ‘have a stain’ or ‘have food,’ for instance, are not
expressed with moe.(191) a. *ólì ìtébù / *ìtébù mòè         ínwà.
          the table table PRP.have stain
          ‘The table / A table has a stain.’
      b. *ólí áwà / *áwà mòè            émàè.
          the dog dog PRP.have food
          ‘The dog has food.’     Constructions with moe restrict mood but not polarity. They appear as negative
statements (ólí ómòhè í ì mòè úkpùn [the man SC NEG have cloth] ‘The man does not
have cloth’) and polar questions (ólí ómòhè mòè ólí úkpùn? [the man PRP.have the
cloth] ‘Does the man have the cloth of a particular type?’). However, they fail as
imperatives and prohibitives.
     Noun phrase positions in canonical moe constructions differentially constrain
NP type, animacy and syntactic shape. They also accept distinct sets of nouns, pro-
nouns and modifiers. The noun phrase position preceding moe allows nominative
pronouns, regardless of person or number. It rejects indefinite subject pronoun a.(192) ò / ì / mà / *à mòè             ópìà.
      he I    we      one PRP.have cutlass
      ‘He owns / I own / We own a cutlass.’Subject position in moe constructions allows proper nouns and common nouns. moe
subject accepts proper nouns of person (òlólò) or place (áfúzé').(193) òlólò mòè        íkèké.      /     áfúzé' mòè          úkpódè.
      Ololo PRP.have bicycle             Afuze PRP.have road
      ‘Ololo has a bicycle.’              ‘Afuze has a road.’Subject position with moe accepts animate (áwà) or inanimate (ìtébù) common
nouns regardless of modification by definite predeterminer ólí.(194) a. ólí áwà / áwà mòè            ùrìàì.

article ólí, a postdeterminer or both.(195) a. ólí óvbèkhàn / *óvbèkhàn mòè          ópìà.

         the youths     each         youth    PRP.have cloth
         ‘Each of the youths has a cloth.’     Subject position in moe constructions allows all postdeterminers: demonstra-
tives deictic nà and áìn (ólí ómóhé nà / ólí ómóhé áìn mòè ólí úkpùn [the man this the
man that PRP.have the cloth] ‘This / That man has the cloth’) as well as contrastive
nóì (ómóhé nóì mòè ólí úkpùn [man next PRP.have the cloth] ‘The next man has the

cloths] ‘Both men have cloths / plenty of wearables’) and e.g. cardinal èvá also al-
lowing an optional definite article ((élí) ímòhè èvá mòè élí íkpùn [the men two

     In addition, moe subject allows impersonal pronouns.26 Included are demon-
stratives deictic ònà and óáìn in addition to contrastive ónóì (ónóì / óáìn mòè íkèké

     Noun phrase positions with moe align differentially with discourse positions.
Subject corresponds to li/ni focus position, topic position or interrogative pronoun

ólí ómóhé mòè [the cloth PF the man PRP.have] ‘It is the cloth that the man has’).
However, it corresponds to interrogative pronouns émé' ‘what’ and ékà ‘how much.’
moe direct objects never correspond to interrogatives óé' ‘who’ or ébé' ‘where.’(200) a. émé' ólí ómóhé mòè?

associated with verbs. moe restricts inflection, verbal affixes, auxiliary categories
and preverbs.
     moe constructions limit aspect. They inflect for Present perfect in an irregular
fashion. moe subject phrase shows the expected right edge low tone, but verb tone
is low. Typically, verb tone is high for Present perfect. Past perfect inflection with a
right edge high tone subject phrase, regardless of verb tone, is unacceptable in sim-
ple declarative constructions.(203) ólí ómòhè mòè       àmágò.

cepts common nouns modified by the definite article but not bare nouns.30(140) a. érí' ólí ómóhé / *ómóhé gbé'         ólí ófè.

with human nouns (érí' ólí ómóhé ná / áín gbé' ófè [SA the man this that PAP.kill rat]
‘Indeed, this / that man killed a rat’). Contrastive demonstrative nóí, which disal-
lows the definite article, occurs in SA subjects (érí' ómóhé nóí gbé' ófè [SA man next

     SA subject phrases accept the kindred deictic postdeterminer élìyó but not con-
trastive ódàn (érí' úkpún élìyó / *ódàn ó ò ghàén [SA cloth that.kind different.kind SC
H costly] ‘Indeed, cloth of that kind is costly’).
     Few quantifiers appear in SA subject phrases. Collective universal quantifier
èrèmé does occur, although not with the definite article (érí' (*élí) éwé èrèmé ó' vbì
ìwè [SA the goats all PAP.enter LOC house] ‘Indeed, all the goats entered the
house’). Remaining quantifiers, distributive universal òdóòdé, partitive existential
ósò and contrastive existential óvbèé, fail in SA subject phrases.
     SA subject position allows numeral modifiers, e.g. collective ìgbìgbé ‘all ten’
(érí' íkpún ìgbìgbé tóó' á vbí ólì èràìn [SA cloths all.ten PAP.burn CS LOC the fire]
‘Indeed, all ten cloths burned up in the fire’) and cardinal èvá ‘two’ (érí' (*élí) éfè èvá

     Subject phrases in SA constructions allow postdeterminers framed by Associa-
tive ísì (érí' (ólí) éwé ísì ólí ókpósó ó' vbì ìwè [SA the goat ASS the woman PAP.enter
LOC house] ‘Indeed, the goat of the woman entered the house’), Relator li (érí' (ólí)

gbé' ólí ófè [SA the man R he PAP.drink the wine PAP.kill the rat] ‘Indeed, the man
who drank the wine killed the rat’). For each subject, definite article ólí is optional.
     SA matrix clauses accept as subjects personal pronouns, but they restrict imper-
sonal pronouns. SA subject phrases allow subject personal pronouns for each per-
son and number. Emphatic personal pronouns (e.g. mèmè ‘I’) are precluded from SA
subjects.(142) érí' í / ú / ó gbé'           ólí ófè.
      SA I you he PAP.kill the rat
      ‘Indeed, I / you / he killed the rat.’     As for impersonal pronouns, they are more restricted. SA subject position ac-
cepts contrastive demonstrative ónóí (érí' ónóí ó' vbì ìwè [SA next.one PAP.enter LOC
house] ‘Indeed, the next one entered the house’), and both deictic distal óáín and
proximal óná (érí' óáín / óná ó' vbì ìwè [SA that.one this.one PAP.enter LOC house]
‘Indeed, that one / this one entered the house’). The preferred form for the proximal
is emphatic ónánà (érí' ónáná ó' vbì ìwè [SA this.very.one PAP.enter LOC house]
‘Indeed, this very one entered the house’).
     SA subjects admit numeral pronouns, e.g. collective èvèvá (érí' èvèvá ó' vbì ìwè
[SA all.two PAP.enter LOC house] ‘Indeed, both entered the house’) and cardinal
èvá, so long as it heads a partitive vbi phrase (érí' èvá vbí ó / *èvá ó' vbì ìwè [SA two
LOC it two PAP.enter LOC house] ‘Indeed, two of them entered the house’). Also
found as SA subject is partitive pronoun úkpòkpá ‘one’ (érí' úkpòkpá vbí ó / úkpòkpá
lá' lè [SA one LOC it one PAP.run depart] ‘Indeed, one of them / one ran away’). Its
cardinal counterpart òkpá is disallowed.
     SA subject position accepts some but not all quantifier pronouns. It allows col-
lective universal pronoun èrèmé (érí' èrèmé ó' vbì ìwè [SA all PAP.enter LOC house]
‘Indeed, all entered the house’), though not as partitive vbi phrase head. Remaining
quantifier pronouns (distributive universal òdóòdé, partitive existential ósò, and
contrastive existential óvbèé) fail as SA subjects, even when partitive phrase head.
     As SA subjects, kindred pronouns are not uniformly acceptable. élìyó occurs
(érí' élìyó ó ò ghàén [SA that.kind SC H be.costly] ‘Indeeed, that kind is costly’),
whereas ódàn does not, even when partitive phrase head (*érí' ódán vbí úsèé ísì ìyáín
406 | Noncanonical constructionsó' vbì ìwè [SA different.kind LOC group ASS their PAP.enter LOC house] ‘Indeed, a

     SA subject position accepts a pronominally headed attributive phrase (érí' ólí
óbín' gbé' ólí ófè [SA the dark.one PAP.kill the rat] ‘Indeed, the dark one killed the
rat’) or relative clause, provided Recurrent preverb a is not present (érí' ólí ó (*á) dé'
ólí úkpùn gbé ólí ófè [SA one he RC PAP.buy the cloth PRP.kill the rat] ‘Indeed, the

     SA severely confines expression of matrix clause polarity and mood. It fails as
negative statement, imperative and prohibitive. However, SA occurs as a polar inter-
rogative (érí' ólí ómóhé shén' ólì émà? [SA the man PAP.sell the yam] ‘Indeed, did the
man sell the yam?’).
     SA constructions constrain matrix clause inflection as well as occurrence of
auxiliaries and preverbs. With regard to aspect, SA matrix clauses inflect for Past
perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predictive prospective.31 They reject Present perfect,
Continuous imperfect and Anticipative prospective.(143) a. érí' ólí ómóhé gbé'       ólí ófè.

         SA the man PRED sell the yam
         ‘Indeed, the man will sell the yam.’     SA matrix clauses limit modality forms. They permit epistemic Certaintive ma
(érí' ólí ómóhé má' shén ólí émà [SA the man PAP.CER sell the yam] ‘Indeed, the man
surely sold the yam’) and Hypothetical kha (érí' ólí ómóhé khà shén ólí émà [SA the
man PAP.HYP sell the yam] ‘Indeed, the man would have sold the yam’). But SA
rejects remaining epistemic forms (Dubitatives vba and bia, Concessive rere, Deduc-
tive za, Resultative za) in addition to deontic Hortative i.
     SA allows relative tense Anterior ke (érí' ólí ómóhé ké' shén ólí émà [SA the man

kpe (érí' ólí ómóhé kpé' shén ólí émà [SA the man PAP.SUB sell the yam] ‘Indeed, the
man sold the yam despite the pending situation’).
     In SA constructions preverbs are partially restricted. Manner-demonstratives
(DMD ìyó and PMD ìná) both fail. Among Evaluative preverbs (duu ‘for no reason,’
woo ‘instead,’ kuku ‘after all’), only duu appears (érí' ólí ómóhé dú'ú gbé ólí ófè [SA
the man PAP.EVAL kill the rat] ‘Indeed, the man killed the rat for no reason’).

Ingressive ya, Egressive mo, Past Absolute ya and mo). Among acceptable phasal
aspectualizers are Repetitive che (érí' ólí ómóhé ché' hóó ólí úkpùn [SA the man

gbo (érí' ólí ómóhé gbó' hóó ólí úkpùn [SA the man PAP.ADD wash the cloth] ‘Indeed,
the man also washed the cloth’). Unacceptable are Durative se and Punctual ghe.
     SA admits temporal preverbs tua (érí' ólí ómóhé túá' é ólí émà [SA the man
PAP.hurriedly eat the yam] ‘Indeed, the man hurriedly ate the yam’) and bobo (érí'
ólí ómóhé bó'bò é ólí émà [SA the man PAP.promptly eat the yam] ‘Indeed, the man
promptly ate the yam’). It rejects kpao.
     In SA constructions, quantity preverbs except Nonabsolute Intensifier zeze are
allowed. One thus finds zemi (érí' ólí ómóhé zé'mì é ólí émàè [SA the man PAP.ABSI
eat the food] ‘Indeed, the man ate a lot of the food’), gba (érí' élí ímóhé gbá' é ólí

and dobo (érí' ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì é ólí émàè [SA the man PAP.REFL him eat the food]
‘Indeed, the man himself ate the food’).
     Uniformly appearing in SA clauses are subject attributives dábo ‘deliberately,’
dóbo ‘mistakenly,’ dúda ‘defiantly,’ miti ‘able,’ gbúdu ‘courageously,’ dégbe ‘care-
fully,’ totóbo ‘intensely’ and kakégbe ‘perseveringly.’ Suggestive examples include
dóbo (érí' ólí ómóhé dó'bò gbé ólí ófè [SA the man PAP.mistakenly kill the rat] ‘In-
deed the man mistakenly killed the rat’) and miti (érí' ólí ómóhé mí'tì gbé ólí ófè [SA
the man PAP.able kill the rat] ‘Indeed the man was able to kill the rat’).
     SA is partially constrained by subordination. It occurs in indicative khi S-
complements but not conditional si or subjunctive li complements.(144) òjè één-í        khí érí' ólí ómóhé é'      ólí émà.
      Oje PRP.know-F IND SA the man PAP.eat the yam

Relator particle li controls a collective/distributive interpretation for some modifier
phrases. Affected are cardinal numeral and size adjectives, respectively. Collective
                                                                 Determiners | 219interpretations require li and induce high tone spread on head noun.25 Distributive
interpretations disallow li and fail to induce high tone spread.
    Cardinal numerals following a head noun reveal a distributive or collective in-
terpretation depending on li occurrence. Numeral phrases marked by li express a
collective character. Absent li, cardinal numerals convey a distributive character.
Cardinal numeral phrases with a collective or distributive interpretation dependent
on occurrence or non-occurrence of li modify animate and inanimate nouns.ímóhé lì èélé                           ímòhè èélé

‘both intertwined vines, twosome’       ‘two vines’     The collective/distributive interpretation of cardinal numerals arises with some
but not all place nouns. The noun ìwè ‘dwelling, house’ allows li and li-less com-
plements, thus permitting a collective or distributive interpretation, respectively.
However, the related place noun óà ‘home, house’ rejects li marked cardinal numer-
als and thus only allows a distributive interpretation.íwé    lì èvá                           ìwè    èvá

 ‘group of two homes’                   ‘two homes’Collective and distributive interpretations arise with social collective nouns, where
only the collective interpretation might be anticipated.òtú          lì ìsín                    òtú        ìsín
age.group R nine                        age.group nine
‘entire 9th age grade / group’          ‘nine age groups’     Interpretations similarly controlled by Relator li are evident with the adjectives
kéré and kísín. When a li complement, these forms attribute physical size, inducing
high tone spread on the head noun. In the absence of li but still serving as a modifi-
er, kéré and kísín express quantification or amount, failing also to induce high tone
spread on their head noun. Either attribution with li or quantification without li
applies to inanimate count nouns not marked inflectionally for number.

of inanimate, animate and human count nouns that mark number inflectionally.
Attribution, where li is obligatory, allows only forms with a singular prefix, while
quantification, where li is disallowed, admits only plural prefix forms. Attribution li
interpretations require an inanimate count noun head with a singular prefix, e.g.
úkpún ‘cloth,’ while quantification interpretations, lacking li, require the plural
prefix, e.g. íkpùn ‘cloths.’úkpún lì kéré                           *úkpùn kéré

An unmarked locative source phrase expresses an ‘indigene’ relation. Its initial

of the latter reflect place, either common nouns (éìmì) or proper nouns (àfúzé').

‘indigene of the spirit world’           ‘indigene of Afuze’    Reference point nominals in indigene expressions do not accept modifiers. They
reject the definite article (*òívbí ólí éímí [indigene the spirit.world] ‘indigene of the
spirit world’) and postdeterminers (*òívbí éímí élìyó [indigene spirit.world that.kind]
‘indigene of that kind of spirit world’). òívbí itself rejects the definite article (*ólì

Relative clauses in Emai show a head position co-referential with a constituent in an
immediately following clause. Head position exponents are either lexical nouns or a
relative pronoun in its singular (ólí) or plural (élí) form.27 A lexical noun requires
that Relator li obligatorily precede the relative clause, while a relative pronoun re-
jects particle li. Like most postnominal modifiers, relative clauses induce high tone
spread on their head noun (e.g. ókpósó rather than òkpòsò).(13) a. ókpósó lí ólí ómóhé záwó'      fí      áwá údò.
        woman R the man PAP.see PRP.hit dog stone
        ‘A woman whom the man saw hit a dog with a stone.’
     b. ólí ó nwú'      émà lí    ònwìmè, ò fí          áwá údò.
        one he PAP.take yam APP farmer he PRP.hit dog stone
        ‘The one who gave yam to a farmer, he hit a dog with a stone.’Relative clause structures constrain occurrence of inflection, auxiliaries and pre-
verbs as well as postdeterminers modifying the head noun. In addition, marked
relative clauses show relativization of an extensive range of grammatical relations.
Pronominally headed relative clauses are discussed in Chapter 5, 5.8.","[243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249]"
"7.4.1 Matrix clause marking of antitopic relationWhen a nominal occurs in RD position, a pronoun in the corresponding matrix
clause position is obligatory. Pronoun form is determined by grammatical relation
and number agreement.
370 | Noncanonical constructions     RD noun phrases (ólí ómòhè) correspond to matrix subject position. When they
do, subject position shows a nominative pronoun, with only third person plural (yan
~ e) constrained by matrix aspect (Chapter 5, 5.1).(46) a. ó shén'      ólí úkpùn lí       ólì òkpòsò, ì khì ólí ómòhè.
        he PAP.sell the cloth APP the woman ID be the man
        ‘He sold the cloth to the woman, that is the man.’

        they PAP.kill the rat ID be the men
        ‘They killed the rat, that is the men.’Also corresponding to RD position constituents are monotransitive direct objects (ólí
úkpùn).(47) ólí ómòhè shén        óì lí ólì òkpòsò, í khì ólí úkpùn.
     the man PRP.sell it APP the woman ID be the cloth
     ‘The man sold it to the woman, that is the cloth.’    Grammatical relations other than subject and monotransitive direct object fail to
correspond to RD position. For example, first object (óí) in a double object comple-
ment never corresponds to an RD constituent (ólì òkpòsò). As well, second object
émì never corresponds to RD úkpóràn either.(48) a *ólí óvbèkhàn fí        óí úkpóràn, í khì ólì òkpòsò.

        ‘The youth hit the woman with something, that is a stick.’Direct objects of verbs in series never corefer to an RD constituent, as with élí éràn

      the man PAP.sell the cloth APP her ID be the woman
      ‘The man sold the cloth to her, that is the woman.’    RD position corresponds to an entire Associative ísì phrase in subject position
(éghó' ísì ólì òkpòsò), not simply to a possessor (ólì ònwìmè).(51) a. ò úé-ì,                í khì éghó' ísì ólì òkpòsò.

         ‘Her money is lost, that is the woman’s.’    RD position reveals asymmetry in its acceptance of vbi marked locative rela-
tions. RD constituents correspond to vbi complements serving as verb argument
(ìbéèdì,’ ìwè).(52) a. ólí ómòhè méhén-í          vbì ò, í khì ólì ìbéèdì.

        the man PAP.run enter LOC it ID be the house
        ‘The man ran into it, that is the house.’However, RD noun phrases never correspond to vbi complements serving as locative
adjuncts (ékóà with verb gbe ‘dance’ or èkìn with verb shen ‘sell’).(53) a. *òjè gbé           vbí ò, í khì ólí ékóà.

         Oje PRP.sell the cloth APP her LOC it ID be the market
         ‘The man sold the cloth to her in it, that is in the market.’As well, RD locative constituents never correspond to a matrix clause deictic loca-
tive pronoun, e.g. èvbò.
372 | Noncanonical constructions(54) *ólí ómóhé lá'       ó      vbì èvbò, í khì ólì ìwè.
      the man PAP.run enter LOC yonder ID be the house
      ‘The man ran into there, that is the house.’    Finally, RD constituents never correspond to any adjunct, temporal (òdè), man-
ner (sùnésúné) or manner-demonstrative (ìyó), where a zero pronoun might be ex-
pected in adjunct position.(55) a. *ólí ómòhè dé         ògèdè, í khì élélá òdè.

         the man PRP.eat the food ID be DMD
         ‘The man ate the food, that is that way.’7.4.2 Antitopic position nominal constraintsAntitopic (RD) position restricts nominal shapes. Although noun type is not limited,
pronominal type and nominal modifier type are.
    RD position accepts nominal types ranging from proper names to inanimate
count nouns. Proper names (òlólò ‘Ololo’) are thus acceptable in RD position.(56) ó gbé'       ólí ófè, ì khì òlólò.
     he PAP.kill the rat ID be Ololo
     ‘He killed the rat, that is Ololo.’Common nouns, modified for example by definite article ólí/élí, appear in RD posi-
tion. We thus find ólí/élí and nouns for human (ómòhè), nonhuman animate (ófè)
and inanimate (úkpùn) in RD position.14 These noun types in their bare form in RD
position are unacceptable.(57) a. ó gbé'       ólí ófè, í khì ólí ómòhè / *ómòhè.
        he PAP.kill the rat ID be the man          man

     b. ólí ómóhé gbé'         óì, í khì ólí ófè / *ófè.
        the man PAP.kill it ID be the rat           rat
        ‘The man killed it, that is the rat.’

       the man PAP.sold it ID be the cloth           cloth
       ‘The man sold it, that is the cloth.’     RD position constrains some postdeterminers from demonstrative, kindred,
numeral and quantifier classes. Demonstratives appear in RD position. Allowed are
deictic nà and áìn (ó gbé' ólí ófe, í khì ólí ómóhé nà / áìn [he PAP.kill the rat ID be the
man this that] ‘He killed the rat, that is this / that man’). Each requires the definite
article with animate nouns. Contrastive demonstrative nóì, which prohibits the defi-
nite article, also appears in RD position (ó gbé' ólí ófè, í khì ómóhé nóì [he PAP.kill
the rat ID be man next] ‘He killed the rat, that is the next man’).
     RD position rejects kindred postdeterminers élìyó and ódàn (*ólí ómòhè shén óì, í
khì úkpún élìyó / ódàn [the man PRP.sell it ID be cloth that.kind different.kind] ‘The
man sold it, that is cloth of that kind / a different kind’).
     In RD position, quantifier postdeterminers are generally restricted. The one that
occurs does so with an optional definite article. Collective universal quantifier èrèmé
and optional élí appear as modifiers in RD position (é ó' vbì ìwè, í khì (élí) éwé èrèmé
[they PAP.enter LOC house ID be the goats all] ‘They entered the house, that is all
the goats’). Failing as modifiers in RD position are distributive universal quantifier
òdóòdé and existential quantifiers, partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé.
     RD position allows numeral modifiers greater than ‘one’ only with the definite
article, e.g. èvá (é híán' ólí óràn, í khì élí ímòhè èvá / *ímòhè èvá [they PAP.cut the
wood ID be the men two men two] ‘They cut the wood, that is the two men’). More
limited are the multiple functions of form òkpá. RD position rejects both cardinal
numeral òkpá ‘one’ (*ó ó' vbì ìwè, í khì ómòhè òkpá [he PAP.enter LOC house ID be
man one] ‘He entered the house, that is one man’) and emphatic partitive òkpá
‘alone’ (*ó ó' vbì ìwè, í khì ólí ómòhè òkpá [he PAP.enter LOC house ID be the man
alone] ‘He entered the house, that is the man alone’).
     RD does not restrict nonlexical postdeterminers. RD position accepts modifiers
framed as associative phrases, e.g. éwé ísì ólì òkpòsò (ó ó' vbì ìwè, í khì (ólí) éwé ísì ólì
òkpòsò [it PAP.enter LOC house, ID be the goat ASS the woman] ‘It entered the
house, that is the goat of the woman’), attributive phrases, e.g. éwé lí óbín' (ó ó' vbì
ìwè, í khì (élí) éwé lí óbín' [it PAP.enter LOC house ID be the goat R dark] ‘It entered
the house, that is the dark goat’), or relative clauses, e.g. ómóhé lí ó dá' ólí ényò (ó
gbé' ólí ófè, í khì (ólí) ómóhé lí ó dá' ólí ényò [he PAP.kill the rat ID be the man R he
PAP.drink the wine] ‘He killed the rat, that is the man who drank the wine’). In each
there is a preference for the definite article in elicited constructions.
     In constrast to its acceptance of modifiers, RD position accepts no pronominals
of any kind. Personal pronouns, in particular emphatic pronouns (ìyóín, mèmè and
ìyáín), are excluded. Even when accompanied by emphatic partitive òkpá, emphatic
374 | Noncanonical constructionspronouns in RD position are unacceptable (*yán gbé' ólí ófè, í khì ìyàìn òkpá [they
PAP.kill the rat ID be they alone] ‘They killed the rat, that is they alone’).(58) *ó / í / é       gbé'      ólí ófè, í khì ìyòìn /mèmè / ìyàìn
      he I they PAP.kill the rat ID be he                   I they
     ‘He / I / they killed the rat, that is he / I / they.’     No impersonal pronouns appear in RD position, neither demonstratives (óáìn,
ónánà, ónóì), kindred forms (élìyó, ódàn), quantifiers (èrèmé, òdóòdé, ósò, óvbèé) or
numerals (èvá, èvèvá). Numerals even fail when head of a partitive vbi phrase, as
indicated by èvá (*yán ó' vbí ìwè, í khì èvá / èvá vbí íyàìn [they PAP.enter LOC house
ID be two two LOC them] ‘They entered the house, that is two / the two of them’).
     RD position does not accept pronominally headed relative clauses, e.g. ólí ó dé'
ólí úkpùn (*ó gbé' ólí ófè, í khì ólí ó dé' ólí úkpùn [he PAP.kill the rat ID be one he
PAP.buy the cloth]‘He killed the rat, that is the one who bought the cloth’) or attrib-
utive pronominals, e.g. ólí óbín' (*ó gbé' ólí ófè í khì ólí óbín' [he PAP.kill the rat, ID
be the dark.one] ‘He killed the rat, that is the dark one’).","[395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400]"

   The plural pronoun but singular reference constraint on pre-bíì position is maintained when the
collective preverb gba ‘together’ occurs in the matrix clause (mà / vbà / yàn bíì òjè gbá yé ímè [we
you they COM Oje PRP.COL move.to farm] ‘I / You / He and Oje together went to the farm’). Empha-
sizing further the singular reference of the pre bíì pronoun, one cannot use plural pronoun ma ‘we’
in construction with òjè, or even the third person direct object pronoun óì ‘he, she,’ to mean three
participants as in ‘we and Oje.’ It is thus also the case that post-bíì position takes a pronoun (mà bíì

"4.3.2.1 Demonstratives nà, áìn, nóì
Demonstratives consist of deictic and contrastive (nondeictic) members. Deictic
demonstratives consist of proximal nà ‘this/these’ and distal áìn ‘that/those.’ They
do not inflect for grammatical number. With human, nonhuman animate and inan-

gular definite predeterminer. Deictic demonstratives never combine with mass

176 | Noun modifiers     The nondeictic, contrastive demonstrative nòì ‘next, other’ assumes a situation-
al context of multiple exemplars in which one, not in the immediate, perceptible
scene, is singled out. Compared to deictic demonstratives, contrastive nóì combines
with count or mass nouns only when the definite predeterminer is absent (*ólí
ókpósó nóì). nóì is found with human (ókpósó), nonhuman animate (éwé) and inan-
imate (úkpún) nouns inflectionally marked for number, count (émá) and mass (ékén,

Kindred modifiers follow their head noun in a noun phrase, as do numerative, quan-
titative and demonstrative modifiers. Kindreds categorize a referent as to ‘kind’ on a
cluster of properties rather than a single property; they modify nouns that stratify
according to ‘kind of’ relations. Constraints on kindred modifier distribution reveal
classification along two lines: physical stratification according to a hierarchical
‘kind of’ taxonomy (e.g. PLANT, TREE, OAK, BURR OAK realizing unique beginner,
life form, generic, and specific forms, Berlin 1992, Foley 1997; or FURNITURE,
CHAIR, ROCKING CHAIR realizing superordinate, basic, subordinate forms, Rosch
1977) or social stratification according to family ~ non-family affiliation.
     Deictic and contrastive kindred forms are distinguished by an older generation.
Younger speakers tend not to utilize the full range of deictic kindred forms. For old-
er speakers, kindred root forms premit prefixes showing number: singular ó- and
plural é-. Relative distance to speaker is indicated by root contrast: proximal -nìná
and distal -lìyó, respectively.ónìná ‘this kind’                       énìná ‘these kind’
ólìyó ‘that kind’                       élìyó ‘those kind’
                                                                     Determiners | 177For younger speakers, only kindred élìyó is utilized. Its erstwhile deictic and number
values are neutralized, since it is employed for all ‘same kind’ kindred attribution.
For instance, élìyó occurs with singular and plural forms of common nouns.úkpún élìyó                               íkpún élìyó
cloth that.kind                           cloths that.kind
‘cloth of that kind’                      ‘cloths of that kind’     A contrastive kindred meaning is expressed by root -dan. It denotes difference
in kind relative to a referent in the situational context. Its word initial prefix ó-/é-
alternates to express number.ódàn ‘different kind sg’                  édàn ‘different kind pl’Given their prefixal expression of number, the contrastive kindred forms ódàn and
édàn differentially occur with count nouns inflectionally marked for number. Their
respective phrases require number agreement.úkpún ódàn                                íkpún édàn
cloth different.kind                      cloths different.kind
‘cloth of a different kind’               ‘cloths of a different kind’     Kindred modifiers, and by inference kindred forms of the earlier generation, re-
strict their distribution with noun lexemes. As one might expect, kindred forms fail
to occur with proper nouns of any kind. With common nouns, they co-occur with
referents reflecting the classes human (érá élìyó ‘father of that kind,’ ómó élìyó ‘in-

kind’), inanimate (ògbèdí élìyó ‘barrel of that kind,’ ákhé élìyó ‘ceramic pot of that
kind’), locus (íwé élìyó ‘house of that kind,’ àkpó élìyó ‘path of that kind’) and abstract
(ésón élìyó ‘poverty of that kind’). Nonetheless, there are limitations on élìyó and
ódàn/édàn distribution, some sharper than others.
     Human and abstract nouns are constrained in their co-occurrence with kindred
modifiers. Most abstract nouns fail with élìyó or ódàn/édàn (*óbé élìyó ‘badness of
that kind,’ *éhíó élìyó ‘arrogance of that kind,’ *éhí élìyó ‘personal spirit/fate of that
kind,’ *édé élìyó ‘day of that kind’). Human nouns are constrained relative to social
roles outside the immediate family (*óróón élìyó ‘widow of that kind,’ *ágbédé élìyó
‘blacksmith of that kind,’ *ìyèhón élìyó ‘deaf persons of that kind’).
     With animate and inanimate lexemes associated with flora and fauna, élìyó and
ódàn/édàn co-occurrence limitations reflect taxonomic structure. Unique beginner,
life-form and generic level terms (or superordinate and basic level terms) are ac-
ceptable (éhéén élìyó ‘fish of that kind,’ áfìánmí élìyó ‘bird of that kind,’ ényé élìyó
178 | Noun modifiers‘snake of that kind,’ órán élìyó ‘tree of that kind’). Specific level or subordinate level
terms, however, are not (*áwàédà élìyó ‘dogfish of that kind,’ *àwàì élìyó ‘partridge
of that kind,’ *óvbìvbìé élìyó ‘black cobra snake of that kind,’ *ùlókò élìyó ‘iroko tree
[Chlorophora excelsa] of that kind’). Kindred qualities, be they physical or so-
cial/cultural, thus constrain nominal occurrence with Emai’s kindred modifiers.
     As already noted, kindred élìyó co-occurs with count nouns (assuming appro-
priate stratification) that express number inflectionally. It also occurs with nouns
that do not express number by inflectional means.émá élìyó                                 àgógó' élìyó
yam that.kind                             gong that.kind
‘yam of that kind’                        ‘gong of that kind’It is similar for the contrastive kindred forms. ódàn/édàn combine with count nouns
that do not express number inflectionally.émá ódàn                                  àgógó' édàn
yam different.kind                        gong different.kind
‘yam of a different kind’                 ‘gongs of a different kind’     Kindred forms occur with mass nouns that exhibit appropriate physical or social
stratification. élìyó accepts mass nouns such as ékén ‘sand’ and ìéésí ‘rice’ but not
ámé ‘water’ (*ámé élìyó ‘water of that kind’).ékén élìyó                                ìéésí élìyó

‘that kind of sand’                       ‘rice of that kind’Contrastive kindred in singular form occurs with mass nouns only if the latter strati-
fies appropriately (*áwé ódàn ‘water of a different kind’).ékén ódàn / *édàn                         ìéésí ódàn / *édàn
sand different.kind                       rice different.kind
‘different kind of sand’                  ‘different kind of rice’Kindred forms limit their co-occurrence with the definite article and demonstratives.
élìyó fails with nouns modified by óli/éli, as do ódàn/édàn.*ólí éwé élìyó                           *ólí úkpún élìyó

 ‘the goat of a different kind’           ‘the goats of a different kind’Kindred forms also constrain their co-occurrence with demonstrative modifiers.
Neither noncontrastive élìyó nor contrastive ódàn/édàn appears with deictic or con-
trastive demonstrative forms such as áìn ‘that/those.’*ólí éwé élìyó         áìn               *élí éwé édán                áìn

Modifiers that quantify a head noun show universal and existential subclasses
whose members are mutually exclusive. They also exhibit restrictions relative to
definite article, demonstratives and kindred forms. Only existential quantifiers mark
grammatical number inflectionally.
     Existential quantifiers assert the existence of a referent known to the speaker
but not the hearer. They identify a referent from an assumed collective, as with con-
trastive root -vbèé, or simply isolate a referent, as with partitive root -sò. Existential
stems show prefixal number marking through singular ó- and plural é-.ósò ‘certain / some’                      ésò ‘certain / some’
óvbèé ‘another / other’                   évbèé ‘other’Existential quantifiers occur with animate or inanimate count nouns that mark
grammatical number inflectionally. Resulting phrases show number agreement.éwé ósò                                   éwé ésò

inflection. Quantifier prefix in such instances expresses noun phrase number.émá ósò                                émá ésò

 ‘the certain / other goat’              ‘the certain / other goats’    Universal quantifiers are of two types. èrèmé ‘all’ assumes a collective aggregate
and quantifies over the entire collective. òdóòdé ‘each’ also assumes a collective
aggregate but distributes its quantification over each member of the collective. Nei-
ther form inflectionally marks number. Each universal quantifier form appears with
count nouns inflectionally marked as plural. Neither quantifier appears with count
nouns inflected for singular (*éwé èrèmé ‘all goat,’ *óvbékhán òdóòdé ‘each youth’).éwé èrèmé                               ívbékhán òdóòdé

Numeral postdeterminers show cardinal, ordinal, collective and distributive shapes.
Compared to other postdeterminers, they exhibit few restrictions with respect to
count nouns, although numerals greater than one require a noun form inflected for
plural number. Relative to other postdeterminers, cardinal numerals fail to induce
high tone spread in their head noun.
    Cardinal numerals appear with animate (éwè) and inanimate (íkpùn) count
nouns inflectionally marked as plural and with human count nouns (ìkpòsò and
ívbèkhàn), many of which are inflected for number.

186 | Noun modifiers     Cardinal numerals constitute the morphological base for postdeterminer forms
expressing ordinal (e.g. ózèvà), collective (e.g. èvèvá) and distributive (e.g. èvéèvá)
relations. In contrast to cardinal numerals, ordinal, distributive and collective nu-
merals induce high tone spread on their head noun. Only ordinal forms occur with
Relator li, although it is optional.
     Ordinal, collective and distributive numerals restrict their distribution with the
definite predeterminer and other postdeterminers. Neither ordinal, collective, nor
distributive numeral co-occurs with the definite article.*ólí éwé ózèvà                         *élí ógédé     ózèvà

A postdeterminer with emphatic partitive significance, òkpá ‘alone, only,’ is ho-
mophonous with cardinal numeral òkpá ‘one.’ Across speakers, however, there is
some variation in emphatic partitive form (e.g. úkpòkpá, óòkpá, òkpá). The emphatic
partitive is limited to focus or topic position; thus, it fails in positions defined by
basic grammatical relations subject or direct object. Also it fails to induce high tone
spread on its head noun.
    Emphatic partitive òkpá appears with common nouns modified by the definite
predeterminer or with proper names.ólí éwè òkpá                            ólí ómòhè òkpá
the goat alone                          the man alone

‘Oje alone’                             ‘Aleke alone’Emphatic partitive òkpá also combines with emphatic personal pronouns irrespec-
tive of number.mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn òkpá                màmàì / vbàvbà / ìyàìn òkpá

‘I / you / he alone’                    ‘we / you / they alone’However, emphatic partitive òkpá does not occur alone with unmodified common
nouns. It fails with the bare form of animate (éwè) or inanimate (úkpùn) count nouns

It never combines with demonstratives (deictic áìn/nà, contrastive nóì), kindred
forms (deictic élìyó, contrastive ódàn), or existential quantifiers (partitive ósò, con-
trastive óvbèé).*éwè òkpá áìn / nà                     *éwè òkpá nóì

A limited number of quantifying postdeterminers accept intensifier forms. Intensifi-
ers follow their postdeterminer. The cardinal numeral òkpá ‘one’ appears with in-
tensifier dábásá ‘only,’ frequently reduced to dábá.

fier (èrèmé) but not the distributive universal quantifier (òdóòdé) or the collective

tive phrases, attributive phrases and relative clauses. Each appears in grammatical-
ly marked or unmarked structures. Each induces high tone spread on its head noun.","[200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219]"
"L]XP [H Hn ]XP ==> L]XP [L Hn ]XP    Each of these tonal processes is realized in patterns characterizing noun
phrases and basic clauses. Concerning noun phrases, tone of the lexical head, posi-
tion of the modifier (predeterminer ~ postdeterminer), and type of modifier (cardinal
numeral ~ non-numeral) interact to govern tonal distribution. Within a noun
phrase, modifier position differentially affects head tone. Predeterminers induce no
tonal change in the head noun, irrespective of the latter's tonal character. Definite
predeterminer ólì ‘the,’ for instance, imposes no change in the tone values of its
head noun: H L émà ‘yam’ remains H L (ólí émà); L L L ùbèlè ‘gourd’ or òkpòsò
‘woman’ remains L L L (ólì ùbèlè, ólì òkpòsò); H L L ómòhè ‘man’ remains H L L (ólí
ómòhè); L L H àkàsán ‘custard’ remains L L H (ólì àkàsán); L H L ìtébù ‘table’ re-
mains L H L (ólì ìtébù) and H !H éghó' ‘money’ remains H !H (ólí éghó').
                                     Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution | 11   Postdeterminer type differentially constrains head noun tone. Cardinal numeral

termining character of governor tone. Noun phrase complements characterized by a
12 | Orthography and grammatical overviewhigh tone sequence at their left edge are subject to HTL when preceded by a gover-
nor with an inherent final low tone whose vowel elides. The Associative adjunct ísì
or the Correlative Conjunct khì induce HTL in a following noun phrase complement
with the required tonal condition. Lexical òkpòsò and ómòhè thus manifest variable
tone. When unmodified and serving as complement of Associative ísì or Correlative
Conjunct khì, these nouns show a tonal pattern consistent with their lexical shape.ísì òkpòsò                              ísì ómòhè

khì phrases, the initial high of postdetermined ómóhé and ókpósó will absorb the
stranded low tone arising when the final vowel of ísì and khì elides (òmóhé, òkpósó).
HTL thus requires a left edge sequence of high tones.ísì ókpósó lí óbín'                  ísì ómóhé lí óbín'

variability consistent with the governing verb's tonal character. When immediately
preceded by a verb with low tone whose vowel elides, noun phrase complements
exhibiting the required high sequence at left edge (émá élìyó and úbélé élìyó) will
absorb the stranded low tone and display HTL (èmá élìyó and ùbélé élìyó).

14 | Orthography and grammatical overviewRegardless of their lexical tone or grammatically induced tone, noun phrase com-

        the youth      PRP.take yam that.kind APP man R dark
        ‘The youth gave yam of that kind to the dark man.’    Lexical nouns exhibit tonal variability due not only to modifying elements and
preceding governors but also to following constituent type. Noun phrases with a
right edge low tone (émà, ùbèlè, ìtébù and òkpòsò) and followed by an adverbial
adjunct (e.g. òdè ‘yesterday’) evince HTS. Assuming no tonal obstruction, high tone
spreads to noun phrase left edge.(11) a. ólí óvbékhán nwú'        émà.
        the youth      PAP.take yam

        ‘The youth gave yam to the woman.’As with other cases of HTS, high tone position within a head noun (àkàsán and
ìtébù) constrains spread. A low tone sequence at the right edge manifests HTS until
a high tone is reached.

        the youth      SC NEG take custard yesterday
        ‘The youth did not carry custard yesterday.’    Noun phrases serving as complements of transitive verbs also reveal the interac-
tion of HTL and HTS. Although these processes function independently, acting sole-
ly on lexical tone values, they interact in a unidirectional fashion. HTS provides the
high sequence required for HTL. Compare in this regard the tonal contrast of clause
final direct object complements (émà and ùbèlè) compared to direct objects preced-
ing an adverbial and following a low tone verb (èmá sàá, ùbélé òdè). HTS thus feeds
application of HTL. The converse never occurs; HTL never feeds HTS.(13) a. ólí óvbékhán ó ò nwù émà.

clause correlate in large measure with contrasts defined by morphosyntactic catego-
ries. For purposes of presentation, we subsume auxiliary (modality and relative
tense) and adverbial preverb constituents under verb phrase.
16 | Orthography and grammatical overview    Tone patterns affecting verbs and their phrases reflect the interaction of aspect
with other categories. We provide a brief overview of monotransitive clauses incor-
porating monosyllabic auxiliary, preverb and verb forms. Exceptions to these tonal
patterns occur due to factors such as multi-syllabic character, inherent low or high
tone, and verb transitivity.
    Monosyllabic transitive verbs show two broad tone patterns that correlate with
grammatical marking of aspect and polarity. In perfect and imperfect aspect as well
as negation, fixed tone affects the verb. Nonfixed tone characterizes the verb in
prospective aspect.
    In imperfect aspect with a lexical noun subject, transitive verb phrases show an
obligatory subject concord (SC) morpheme followed by an aspect morpheme (Con-
tinuous <C> or Habitual <H>). Under these conditions, verb tone is low.(14) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó dà        ényó élìyó.
        the man SC C drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man is drinking wine of that kind.’
     b. ólí ómóhé ó ò dà        ényó élìyó.
        the man SC H drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man drinks wine of that kind.’For simple negation, a transitive verb is preceded by subject concord and negation
(NEG) morphemes. Under this condition, verb tone is low as well.(15) ólí ómòhè í ì        dà   ényó élìyó.
     the man SC NEG drink wine that.kind
     ‘The man did not drink wine of that kind.’Verb tone in the imperfect remains unaffected by auxiliary and preverb constituents
interposed between aspect and the verb. When a preverb such as che, for instance,
follows subject concord and aspect or negation constituents and precedes the verb,
tone is high on the preverb. However, verb tone remains fixed on low.(16) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó ché dà          ényó élìyó.
        the man SC C REP drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man is drinking wine of that kind again.’
     b. ólí ómòhè í ì        ché dà     ényó élìyó.
        the man SC NEG REP drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man did not drink wine of that kind again.’
                                     Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution | 17Verbs in imperfect aspect or perfect negation with multiple auxiliaries or preverbs
behave similarly. Verb tone remains low, while multiple auxiliary or preverb (che,
gbo) constituents show an alternating high down-stepped high tone pattern.(17) ólí ómòhè í ì       ché gbó' dà       ényó élìyó.
     the man SC NEG REP ADD drink wine that.kind
     ‘The man did not again drink wine of that kind too.’     Transitive verbs show a contrasting tonal pattern with perfect aspect. With a
lexical noun subject in the perfect, no subject concord or aspect morpheme is seg-
mentally realized. Verbs exhibit high tone, downstepped high (dá'), when preceded
by the right edge high tone subject phrase of Past perfect (PAP), or basic high (dá),
when preceded by the right edge low tone subject phrase of Present perfect (PRP).(18) a. ólí ómóhé dá'         ényó élìyó.
        the man PAP.drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man drank wine of that kind.’
     b. ólí ómòhè dá          ényó élìyó.
        the man PRP.drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man drank wine of that kind.’When perfect aspect combines with auxiliary or preverb constituents, verb tone
distinct from the imperfect occurs. Tone realization on auxiliary or preverb varies
according to perfect aspect type. In the Past perfect, an initial monosyllabic auxilia-
ry or preverb shows downstepped high tone (ré', gbó') following a right edge high
tone subject phrase. Verb tone is high.(19) a. ólí ómóhé ré'          dá     ényó élìyó.
        the man PAP.CONC drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man supposedly drank wine of that kind.’
     b. ólí ómóhé gbó'       dá     ényó élìyó.
        the man PAP.ADD drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man drank wine of that kind too.’In the Present perfect, an initial monosyllabic auxiliary or preverb shows a high low
tone (i.e. H L, gbóò, máà) following a right edge low tone subject phrase. Verb tone
remains high.(20) a. ólí ómòhè gbóò       dá     ényó élìyó.
        the man PRP.ADD drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man has drunk wine of that kind too.’
18 | Orthography and grammatical overview    b. ólí ómòhè máà       dá    ényó élìyó.
       the man PRP.CER drink wine that.kind
       ‘The man must have drunk wine of that kind.’Verb phrases with multiple monosyllabic auxiliaries or preverbs show high low
alternation between adjacent constituents. The initial constituent retains its high
downstep or high low character according to subject phrase tone as Past or Present
perfect. Verb tone remains high.(21) a. ólí ómóhé ré'         gbò dá       ényó élìyó.
        the man PAP.CONC ADD drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man supposedly drank wine of that kind too.’
     b. élí ímòhè gbóò       gbà dá       ényó élìyó.
         the men PRP.ADD COL drink wine that.kind
         ‘The men have drunk wine of that kind together too.’     Under prospective aspect, where there is no subject concord or high downstep,
monotransitive verbs show a nonfixed tone pattern. Prospective aspect is condi-
tioned by the inherently high tone morpheme ló at left edge of a verb phrase. ló is
preceded by either a right edge high tone subject phrase in prospective Predictive or
a right edge low tone subject phrase in prospective Anticipative. Prospective ló con-
ditions low tone in the immediately following constituent, be it verb, auxiliary or
preverb constituent. Verbs, regardless of whether preceded by prospective Predic-
tive (PRED) ló with its right edge high tone subject phrase or Anticipative ló with its
right edge low tone subject phrase, evince low tone.(22) a. ólí ómóhé ló       dà    ólí ényò.
        the man PRED drink the wine
        ‘The man will drink the wine.’
     b. ólí ómòhè ló      dà    ólí ényò.
        the man ANTI drink the wine
        ‘The man is about to drink the wine.’However, verbs nonadjacent to prospective aspect ló do not show low tone. When ló
precedes a monosyllabic auxiliary or preverb, tonal alternation occurs across the
verb phrase. Preverb che immediately following Predictive ló, for instance, shows
low tone while the following verb shows high tone.(23) ólí ómóhé ló      chè dá     vbí ólí ényò.
     the man PRED REP drink LOC the wine
     ‘The man will again drink from the wine.’
                                     Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution | 19Multiple auxiliaries or preverbs (che gbo) following Predictive ló lead to high low
alternation in the verb phrase and a high tone verb. Thus verb tone in prospective
aspect is nonfixed relative to perfect and imperfect aspect.(24) ólí ómóhé ló      chè gbó dá       vbí ólí ényò.
     the man PRED REP ADD drink LOC the wine
     ‘The man will again drink the wine too.’     Variable tone is evident in other constructions that also fail to assert the occur-
rence of an event. In imperative constructions, transitive verbs that occur clause
initially (following a covert subject pronoun with high tone, singular ú or plural vbá)
show low tone, as do verbs that follow Conative (CON) preverb òó.(25) a. dà    ólí ényò.
        drink the wine
        ‘Drink the wine.’
     b. ólí ómòhè ó ó'       dà    ólí ényò.
        the man SC CON drink the wine
        ‘The man went to drink the wine.’However, transitive verbs that fail to occur initially in imperative constructions do
not show low tone. When a monosyllabic preverb precedes the verb in an imperative
construction, as with initial che, che receives low tone and the following verb exhib-
its high tone.(26) chè dá     vbí ólí ényò.
     REP drink LOC the wine
     ‘Drink from the wine again.’Multiple auxiliaries or preverbs (che gbo) in imperative constructions lead to low
high alternation in the verb phrase and high tone on the verb.(27) chè gbó dá        ólí ényò.
     REP ADD drink the wine
     ‘Drink the wine again too.’     Tonal alternation in the verb phrase also characterizes prohibitive constructions
marked by a second person subject pronoun (singular é or plural vbá) and prohibi-
tive morpheme è. Verbs that follow Prohibitive è (PR) exhibit high tone.
20 | Orthography and grammatical overview(28) é   è dá        ólí ényò.
     you PR drink the wine
     ‘Don't drink the wine.’When an auxiliary (ke) or preverb (che) intervenes between Prohibitive è and the

2 Morphology
Word forms in Emai arise through morphological processes of inflection and deriva-
tion. Inflection expresses number. More than other parts of speech, nominal roots
inflect for number, with prefixes attaching to noun roots, nominal pronouns and
nominal modifier roots. Verb inflection and adverb inflection each involve a single
affixal form.
     Derivation impacts verbs, nouns and adverbs. Verb derivation is limited to af-
fixation. Nominal derivation manifests three major structural types: nominalization,
compounding and reduplication. Derivation lexicalizes nouns from nouns, nouns
from verbs, nouns from verb-noun collocations, adverbs from verbs, and nouns
from entire phrases. Within each of these types there are structural subtypes based
on formal or functional criteria.","[36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]"
"2.6.1 Stem reduplicationStem reduplication exhibits five structural classes. It affects noun, adverbial noun,
pronoun and postdeterminer combinations. The classes vary in their effacement of
84 | MorphologyNS-1 final vowel or the portion of NS-2 reduplicated. The resulting reduplicated
forms within the five classes serve primarily as functional rather than lexical items.
     For one class of reduplicated forms, the entire stem is repeated. The final vowel
or its tone in NS-1 is thus retained. Members denote relational nouns, temporal ad-
verbials, property nouns, abstract nouns and an item in nature. For some, the se-
mantic effect of reduplication maintains the stem referent while maximally extend-
ing a key dimension of referent meaning. For others, reduplication generates a
distinct referent. In one case, the stem referent cannot be synchronically identified.","[109, 110]"

it is unbounded, and thus not overtly expressed, in which case it is marked by fi / ku
a. Choice of fi or ku reflects grammatical number of affected argument, fi for singular
and ku for plural/mass. ku often reflects a distributive sense characterized in English
translation by ‘throughout, all over’ or verbs such as ‘splash.’
      Bounded and unbounded change predications occur with a variety of verbs in
series, in particular those expressing change of location or change of state. These
verbs assume intransitive or transitive shapes where they tend not to accept either
CL o or CS a in the absence of fi or ku. Distribution facts reveal five patterns for com-
plex transitive predications of projected and extended change.",[585]
"13.3.4 VP-complement logical subject and nominal modifiersVP-complements, whose logical subject serves as direct object of the preceding
verb, share some restrictions with grammatical subjects of subjunctive li comple-
ments. Direct objects preceding VP-complements reveal a nonuniform acceptance of
nominal modifiers as well as pronominals.
     Direct objects preceding VP-complements allow the definite article (ólí ómóhé
‘the man’).(40) ólí ókpósó ré'         é ólí ómóhé gbè ólí ófè.
     the woman PAP.CONC tell the man kill the rat
     ‘The woman then told the man to kill the rat.’
812 | Embedded S- and VP-complementsThis same direct object position allows nouns modified by Associative ísì phrases
(òvíén ísì èmé ‘slave of mine’), Relator li phrases (ómóhé lí óbín' ‘the dark man’), and
li marked relative clauses (ómóhé lí ó dé' ólí úkpún ‘man who bought the cloth’).
     Logical subjects of VP-complements permit all postdeterminers except kindred
forms. They do not admit élìyó and ódàn, since matrix verbs like e ‘tell’ require a
direct object noun that is human. Exemplars of demonstrative, quantifier and nu-
meral classes occur as logical subjects for VP complements. Deictic demonstratives
appear with human nouns (ólí ómóhé ná / áín ‘this / that man’), as does contrastive
demonstrative nóì (ómóhé nóí ‘the next man’). Direct object position preceding VP
complements accepts quantifiers: collective universal èrèmé (ímóhé èrèmé ‘all the
men’), distributive universal òdóòdé (ímóhé èrèmé ‘each of the men’), partitive exis-
tential ósò (ómóhé ósò ‘a certain man’) and contrastive existential óvbèé (ómóhé
óvbèé ‘another man’). Logical subjects of VP-complements accept numeral
modifers, including collective (e.g. ímóhé èvèvá ‘both men’), ordinal (ómóhé lí ózèvà
‘a second man’) and cardinal forms, although cardinals must be identified as defi-
nite, for example by the definite predeterminer (e.g. élí ímòhè èvá ‘the two men’, ólí
ómòhè òkpá ‘the one man’).713.3.5 VP-complement logical subject and pronounsVP-complement logical subjects (occupying direct object position governed by a
preceding verb) accept pronouns as a class. However, this position reveals some
retrictions regarding personal, indefinite, logophoric, partitive and impersonal pro-
nouns.8 VP-complement logical subjects occur as accusative pronouns, regardless of
person or number.(41) ólí ókpósó ré'        é    mé / wé / óí gbè ólí ófè.
     the woman PAP.CONC tell me you him kill the rat
     ‘The woman then told me / you / him to kill the rat.’     VP complement logical subjects assume the shape of attributive phrase pro-
nouns (ólí kéré ‘the small one’) and pronominally headed relative clauses with spe-
cific reference (ólí ó dé' émá ‘one who bought yam’).9 VP-complement logical subject
does not accept a logophoric pronoun in single complement structures.10
     Logical subjects of VP-complements only limit impersonal kindred pronouns.
They prohibit élìyó and ódàn due to a conflict between their affinity for nonhuman
nouns and VP subcategorization for a human houn direct object, as with e ‘tell’.
     Remaining impersonal classes, demonstrative, quantifier, and numeral, are not
similarly affected. VP-complement logical subjects allow contrastive demonstrative
ónóì ‘the next one’ and deictic demonstrative ónà or óáìn. They accept universal

tive ósó, contrastive óvbèé). Numeral pronouns as VP-complement subjects are
grammatical. Collective (e.g. èvèvá) and ordinal (e.g. ólí ózévá) are found, as are
cardinal numerals (e.g. èvá), although the latter again prefer a partitive phrase (èvá
vbí élí ímóhé ‘two of the men,’ úkpòkpá vbí élí ímóhé ‘one of the men’).(42) a. ó ré'           é úkpòkpá vbí élí ímóhé gbè ólí ófè.

        ‘She then told two of the men to kill the rat.’13.4 Complement type and verb type
Although Emai complement types vary in their syntactic properties, they differ
along an additional dimension. Complement types do not distribute uniformly
across verb types, as revealed in Table 6.","[837, 838, 839]"
"4.3.3.3.1      Marked attributive li
Attributive li complements attract adjective, noun, and nominalized verb exponents.
Each complement type reveals further differentiation and limitations. The position
following li limits syntactic elaboration. It disallows the definite article as physical
property noun modifier.*émá lí ólì òbàn               *éwé lí ólí óbín'
 yam R the raw/uncooked/unripe goat R the dark
 ‘the uncooked yam’             ‘the dark goat’li complement exponents do not accept postnominal modifiers either. When kindred
élìyó follows li and its complement, élìyó modifies the head noun, not the attributive
nominal.àmágó lí óbán élìyó
mango R unripe that.kind
‘unripe mango of that kind’ / *‘mango that is that kind of unripe’    Attributive li complements permit adjectives for age, color, human propensity,
size, and physical property. Age adjectives complement human nouns and denote a
gradable or relative age/status (óvbékhán ‘youth,’ ómòò ‘friend’), not an nongrada-
ble property (*ómóhé lì kéré [male R younger] ‘younger male’; *ókpósó lì kéré [female
R younger] ‘younger female’).18óvbékhán lì kéré                         ómóó lì kéré

o-, or plural prefix e-. The erstwhile verbs agree in number with animate/inanimate
count nouns inflected for number. Among these li complements are forms express-
ing color, e.g. bin ‘be dark,’ fuan ‘be white,’ vbae ‘be red’ or physical property (khua

‘senior /older friend’                  ‘blacksmith friend’The fourth nominal class in li complement position consists of the nonnumeral
quantity noun ògbèré ‘plentiful.’24 The only member of its class, it modifies count or
mass nouns. When a count noun expressing number inflectionally occurs as head,
its plural form is required (*óvbékhán lì ògbèré ‘a lot of youth’).ívbékhán lì ògbèré                      ìéèsí lì ògbèré

pronouns for distal maximum (èvbò) and proximal removed-from-speaker (èàn)
follow the noun íráá ‘area’ and Relator li. At-speaker proximal (ààn) and distal

Compound lexemes in Emai reflect three compositional patterns. Analytic com-
pounds consist of two noun stems (N-N), sometimes three (N-[N-N]). Synthetic com-
pounds consist of a prefix followed by a verb root and a noun stem (prefix-V-N).
Phrasal compounds utilize grammatical markers in their compositional make up (N-
marker-N).

compound is the left noun stem. Relative to taxonomic structural levels, analytic
compounds tend to express specific or subordinate level designation relative to a
noncompound articulated basic or prototypic concept. The right stem tends to de-
note a more specific referent relative to the more general class referent of the left
noun stem. Constituent relations between noun stems reflect an obligatory inalien-
able relation, contrasting with an alienable relation in corresponding syntactic
phrases with a grammatical marker. For some compound lexemes where meaning is
not derived compositionally, a metaphoric interpretation is required.
     Analytic compounds encode objects that fall into subcategories of flora and
fauna as well as fish, insects, birds, containers, location, time units, food items,
traditional belief, kin relations and social roles. Example compounds and their con-
stituents follow.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81]"
"7.3.1 Matrix clause marking of topic relationA matrix clause grammatical relation corresponding to topic is marked in one of two
ways. For the grammatical relations subject, direct object, indirect object, locative,
and possessor, a pronoun is used. For nonlocative adverbial adjuncts, a zero pro-
noun is employed.
    When a topic constituent corresponds to matrix subject, direct object or indirect
object, a pronominal anaphor (or resumptive pronoun) appears in the respective
matrix position. The pronoun is obligatory. Pronoun form for third person for exam-
ple (o, óì, áìn) is determined by grammatical relation (subject, direct object and
indirect object, respectively) and number agreement vis-à-vis the topic constituent.(32) a. ólí ómòhè, ó shén'       ólí úkpùn lí      ólì òkpòsò.

        the woman the man PAP.sell the cloth APP her
        ‘As for the woman, the man sold the cloth to her.’When the topic constituent corresponds to a possessor following Associative ísì, a
genitive pronoun (òí) in possessor position is obligatory.(33) ólì ònwìmè, éghó' ísì òí úé'-ì.
     the farmer money ASS his PAP.be.lost-F
     ‘As for the farmer, his money is lost.’When a topic constituent corresponds to complement of a vbi locative, either of two
marking strategies is followed. If the vbi phrase serves as an adjunct, anaphoric
locative pronoun o occupies complement position following vbi.
                                                               Topicalization | 363(34) a. ólì èkìn, ólí ómòhè shén         émí vbì ò.

        the room the woman PAP.dance LOC it
        ‘As for the room, the woman danced in it.’When topic corresponds to complement of locative vbi serving as verb argument
(e.g. as with o ‘enter’), anaphoric o again occupies vbi complement position.(35) ólì ìwè, ólí ómóhé lá'          ó        vbì ò.
     the house the man PAP.run enter LOC it
     ‘As for the house, the man ran into it.’In contrast, when topic corresponds to a vbi complement serving an ablative ‘from’
relation for a verb of collection (sa ‘fetch’) or commerce (de ‘buy’), anaphoric o as-
sumes complement position. In addition, though, the verb in series za is obligatory
and precedes the vbi complement. Corresponding canonical structures do not show
za (*ólí ómòhè zá vbí ólí édà sá ámé [the man PRP.be.loc LOC the river fetch water]
‘The man fetched water at the river’, *ólí ómóhé zá' vbì ólì èkìn dé ògèdè [the man

        the market the man PAP.be.loc LOC it buy plantain
        ‘As for the market, the man bought plantain from it.’Still another strategy for matrix clause marking of the position corresponding to
topic involves a zero pronoun. It applies to nonlocative adverbial adjuncts.9 When a
topic constituent corresponds to a temporal adverbial adjunct (élélá òdè, òhínà òdè),
adjunct position in the matrix clause is unmarked.(37) a. élélá òdè,       áléké dé'        ògèdè.

364 | Noncanonical constructions7.3.2 Topic position nominal constraintsNoun phrase exponents in topic position are restricted. There are few nominal con-
straints but pronominal and modifier types are limited.
     Topic allows proper nouns, e.g. òlólò ‘Ololo’ as well as count and mass nouns.(38) òlólò, ó gbé'        ólí ófè.
     Ololo he PAP.kill the rat
     ‘As for Ololo, he killed the rat.’Common nouns (human ómòhè, nonhuman animate ófè, inanimate úkpùn or place
èkìn) appear in topic position, although each must be grammatically marked as
information shared by speaker and hearer. Noun types with the definite article are
thus acceptable while bare nouns are not.10(39) a. ólí ómòhè / *ómòhè, ó gbé'             ólí ófè.
        the man          man     he PAP.kill the rat
        ‘As for the man, he killed the rat.’
     b. ólí ófè / *ófè, ólí ókpósó gbé'          óì.
        the rat     rat the woman PAP.kill it
        ‘As for the rat, the woman killed it.’
     c. ólí úkpùn / *úkpùn, ójé shén'          óì lí   ólì òkpòsò.
        the cloth       cloth Oje PAP.sell it APP the woman
        ‘As for the cloth, Oje sold it to the woman.’
     d. ólì èkìn / *èkìn, ójé zá'               vbì ò dé úkpùn.
        the market market Oje PAP.be.loc LOC it buy cloth
        ‘As for the market, Oje bought the cloth from there.’     Topic position limits modifiers from each of the classes demonstrative, kindred,
numeral and quantifier. Demonstratives in topic position are not restricted. Deictic
demonstratives proximal nà and distal áìn occur with human nouns and the definite
article (ólí ómóhé nà / áìn, ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man this that he PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for
this / that man, he killed the rat’). Contrastive demonstrative nóì, which never ac-
cepts the definite article, also appears in topic position (ómóhé nóì, ó gbé' ólí ófè
[man next he PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the next man, he killed the rat’).
     Topic position allows kindred modifiers, both deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn
(éwé élìyó / ódàn á ré' óì zé ìzòbò [goat that.kind different.kind one PAP.take it make
sacrifice] ‘As for that kind of / a different kind of goat, it is used to make a sacrifice’).
     Only one quantifier type occurs in topic position. Existential quantifiers (parti-
tive ósò and contrastive óvbèé) never do. But universal quantifiers without definite
ólí/élí appear in topic position: distributive òdóòdé ((*élí) ímóhé òdóòdé, é ó' vbì ìwè
                                                                   Topicalization | 365[the men each they PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for each of the men, they entered the
house’) and collective èrèmé ((*élí) éwé èrèmé, é ó' vbì ìwè [the goats all they
PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for all the goats, they entered the house’).
     Topic position accepts cardinal numerals, e.g. èvá ‘two,’ but not with the defi-
nite article ((*élì) éfè èvá, é ó' vbì òò [the rats two they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘As for
the two rats, they entered the hole’). Numeral òkpá ‘one’ appears as sole modifier for
a topic nominal (ómòhè òkpá, ó ó' vbì ìwè [man one he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for
one man, he entered the house’), but its emphatic partitive phonological twin with
the sense ‘alone’ requires the definite article (ólí ómòhè òkpá, ó ó' vbì ìwè [the man
alone he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for the man alone, he entered the house’).
     Topic position nominals with an optional definite article accept as a modifier
Associative ísì ((ólí) éwé ísì ólì òkpòsò, ó ó' vbì ìwè [the goat ASS the woman it
PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for the woman's goat, it entered the house’), Relator lí
((ólí) éwé lí óbín', ó ó' vbì ìwè [the goat R dark it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for the
dark goat, it entered the house’), and relative clause lí ((ólí) ómóhé lí ó dá' ólí ényò, ó
gbé' ólí ófè [the man R he PAP.drink the wine he PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the man
who drank the wine, he killed the rat’).
     In topic position, pronouns are relatively unrestricted. Topic accepts only one
personal pronoun type but a range of impersonal pronouns. Emphatic personal
pronouns (e.g. ìyòìn, ìyàìn) appear as topics when they agree in number and person
with their matrix clause anaphor (ó and yán, respectively).(40) ìyòìn / ìyàìn, ó / yán gbé'           ólí ófè.
     he      they he they PAP.kill the rat
     ‘As for him / them, he / they killed the rat.’Emphatic pronouns in topic position accept some postnominal modifiers. Included
among the latter are collective numerals (e.g. èvèvá ‘both’) with plural pronouns
and emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone’ with emphatic singular pronouns.(41) a. íyáín èvèvá, yán gbé'         ólí ófè.
        they both they PAP.kill the rat
        ‘As for both of them, they killed the rat.’
     b. ìyòìn òkpá, ó gbé'         ólí ófè.
        he     alone he PAP.kill the rat
        ‘As for him alone, he killed the rat.’     Topic position accepts impersonal pronouns from demonstrative, kindred, nu-
meral and quantifier classes with few restrictions. Topic position allows demonstra-
tive pronouns: deictic óáìn and ònà (óáìn / ònà, ó gbé' ólí ófè [that.one this.one it
PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for that one / this one, it killed the rat’) as well as contrastive
366 | Noncanonical constructionsónóì (ónóì, ó gbé' ólí ófè [next.one it PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the next one, it killed the
rat’). Topic position also permits emphatic proximal deictic ónánà (ónánà, ó gbé' ólí
ófè [this.very.one it PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for this very one, it killed the rat’).
     Numeral pronouns greater than ‘one’ in topic position are grammatical. They
include forms that are cardinal (e.g. èvá ‘two’) or collective (e.g. èvèvá ‘both, all
two’): (èvá / èvèvá, ólí ókpósó gbóó' íyàìn [two all.two the woman PAP.kill them] ‘As
for two / both, the woman killed them’). However, only cardinal forms occur in topic
position as head of partitive vbi phrases (èvá / *èvèvá vbì ò, ólí ókpósó gbóó' íyàìn
[two both LOC it the woman PAP.kill them] ‘As for two of them, the woman killed
them’). Collective numerals never do.
     Topic position restricts numeral pronoun òkpá ‘one,’ even as head of a partitive
phrase. But emphatic úkpòkpá ‘one’ as partitive vbi phrase head does occur
(úkpòkpá vbì ò / *òkpá, ólí ókpósó gbé' óì [one LOC it one the woman PAP.kill it] ‘As
for one of them, the woman killed it’).
     As topic, quantifier pronouns appear with some limitations. Among universal
quantifiers, collective èrèmé occurs but distributive òdóòdé does not: (èrèmé /
*òdóòdé, ólí ókpósó gbóó' íyàìn [all each the woman PAP.kill them] ‘As for all, the
woman killed them’). Neither universal quantifier occurs as head of a topic position
partitive vbi phrase. Existential partitive quantifier ósò appears in topic position
alone or as head of a partitive vbi phrase (ósò / ósó vbì ò, ólí ókpósó gbé' óì [cer-
tain.one certain.one LOC it the woman PAP.kill it] ‘As for a certain one / a certain
one of them, the woman killed it’). Contrastive existential óvbèé fails in topic posi-
tion, even if head of a partitive vbi phrase (*óvbèé / óvbèé vbì ò, ólí ókpósó gbé' óì
[another.one another.one LOC it the woman PAP.kill it] ‘As for another one / anoth-
er one of them, the woman killed it’).
     In topic position one type of kindred pronoun is grammatical. Kindred deictic
élìyó occurs (élìyó, ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [that.kind.one the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for that
kind of one, the man killed it’), whereas contrastive kindred ódàn does not (*ódàn,
ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [different.kind.one the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for a different kind of
one, the man killed it’). In addition, neither kindred form appears in topic position
when head of a partitive vbi phrase.
     Topic position permits two additional pronominals. It allows attributive phrases
(ólí óbín', ó gbé' ólí ófè [the dark.one he PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the dark one, he
killed the rat’) and pronominally headed relative clauses (ólí ó dé' ólí úkpùn, ó gbé'
ólí ófè [one he PAP.buy the cloth he PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the one who bought the
cloth, he killed the rat’).11

and mood as well as auxiliaries and preverbs. Constructions with a nominal in topic
position show all polarity and mood types. They appear as negative statements (émá
lì òdè, ólí ómóhé í ì shèn óì [yam R yesterday the man SC NEG sell it] ‘As for the yam
from yesterday, the man did not sell it’), polar questions (ólì émà, ólí ómóhé shén' óì?
[the yam the man PAP.sell it] ‘As for the yam, did the man sell it?’), imperatives (ólí
ófé nà, tòn óì [the rat this roast it] ‘As for this rat, roast it’) or prohibitives (ólí émá nà,
é è shén óì [the yam this you PR sell it] ‘As for this yam, don't sell it’).
     Matrix clauses in topic constructions minimally restrict inflectional and auxilia-
ry forms. They inflect for each perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.12(42) a. ólí émà, ólí ómóhé shén'         óì.
        the yam the man PAP.sell it
        ‘As for the yam, the man sold it.’
     b. ólí émà, ólì ómòhè shén           óì.
        the yam the man PRP.sell it
        ‘As for the yam, the man has sold it.’
     c. ólí úkpùn, ólí ómóhé ó ò wèè óì.
        the cloth the man SC H wear it
        ‘As for the cloth, the man wears it.’
     d. ólí úkpùn, ólí ómòhè ò ó wèè óì.
        the cloth the man SC C wear it
        ‘As for the cloth, the man is wearing it.’
     e. ólí émà, ólí ómóhé ló         shèn óì.
        the yam the man PRED sell it
        ‘As for this yam, the man will sell it.’
     f. ólí émà, ólí ómòhè ló        shèn óì.
        the yam the man ANTI sell it
        ‘As for this yam, the man is about to sell it.’As selected modality examples indicate, topic construction matrix clauses do not
restrict their occurrence. Topic constructions allow deontic Hortative í (ólí émà, ólí
ómòhè í shèn óì [the yam the man HOR sell it] ‘As the yam, the man should sell it’).
They permit auxiliaries from each epistemic judgment type, including rational Re-
sultative za and Deductive za (ólí émà, ólí ómòhè záà shén óì [the yam the man
PRP.DED sell it] ‘As for the yam, the man must have sold it’), speculative Certaintive
ma (ólí émà, ólí ómóhé má' shén óì [the yam the man PAP.CER sell it] ‘As for the yam,
the man surely sold it’), Dubitatives vba and bia, as well as assumptive Hypothetical
368 | Noncanonical constructionskha and Concessive rere (ólí émà, ólí ómóhé ré'rè shén óì [the yam the man
PAP.CONC sell it] ‘As for the yam, the man even sold it’).13
     Topic construction matrix clauses do not restrict relative tense. They allow An-
terior ke (ólí émà, ólí ómóhé ké' shén óì [the yam the man PAP.ANT sell it] ‘As for the
yam, the man sold it afterward’) and Subsequent kpe (ólí émà, ólí ómóhé kpé' shén óì
[the yam the man PAP.SUB sell it] ‘As for the yam, the man sold it despite forthcom-
ing conditions’).
     In topic constructions, preverbs are minimally constrained. It is only temporal
preverbs (kpao ‘initially,’ bobo ‘promptly’ and tua ‘hurriedly’) that fail. Topic con-
struction matrix clauses allow all aspectualizer preverbs: phasal Repetitive che,
Additive gbo, Durative se and Punctual ghe in addition to boundary Conative òó,
Ingressive ya, Egressive mo and Past Absolutes ya and mo. Selected examples with
se and òó illustrate aspectualizer behavior: (ólí émà, ólí ómóhé sé' fóló óì [the yam
the man PAP.DUR peel it] ‘As for the yam, the man still peeled it’) and (ólí émà, ólí
ómòhè ó ó' shèn óì [the yam the man SC CON sell it] ‘As for the yam, the man went to
sell it’).
     Additional preverbs appearing in topic construction matrix clauses are evalua-
tives duu ‘for no reason,’ woo ‘instead,’ kuku ‘after all’ and manner-demonstratives
ìná and ìyó. Selected examples with ìyó and duu support this generalization: (ólí
émà, ólí ómóhé íyó' é óì [the yam the man PAP.DMD eat it] ‘As for the yam, the man
ate it that way’) and (ólí émà, ólí ómòhè dúù é óì [the yam the man PRP.EVAL eat it]
‘As for the yam, the man ate it for no reason’).
     In topic construction matrix clauses, one also finds subject attributive preverbs.
In fact, dábo ‘deliberately,’ dóbo ‘mistakenly,’ dúda ‘defiantly,’ miti ‘able,’ gbúdu
‘courageously,’ dégbe ‘carefully,’ totóbo ‘intensely’ and kakégbe ‘perseveringly’ are
each grammatical. Two illustrative constructions show dábo (ólí ómóhé nà, ó dá'bò fí
ólì èkpà fí à [the man this he PAP.deliberately threw the bag propel CS] ‘As for this
man, he deliberately threw the bag away’) and miti (ólí ómóhé nà, ó mí'tì gbé ólí éwè
[the man this he PAP.able kill the goat] ‘As for this man, he was able to kill the
goat’).
     Matrix clauses in topic constructions permit each quantity preverb. Suggestive
examples illustrate with Collective gba (ólí émà, élí ímóhé gbá' é óì [the yam the men
PAP.COL eat it] ‘As for the yam, the men ate it together’) and Nonabsolute Intensifier
zeze (ólí ómóhé nà, ó zé'zè é vbì ólí émà [the man this he PAP.NABI eat LOC the yam]
‘As for this man, he ate a bit of the yam’).
     Topic constructions evince additional constraints under conditions of subordi-
nation. Topic constructions occur in indicative khi complements when a copy of khi
precedes not only the topic constituent (ólí ómòhè) but also its following matrix
clause (ó é ólí émà). Chapter 13 includes further discussion. However, topic con-
structions never appear in conditional si or subjunctive li complements, even under
conditions of complement marker doubling.

     Oje PRP.know-F IND the man IND he PAP.eat the yam
     ‘Oje knew that as for the man, he ate the yam.’Topic constructions provide an equally mixed impression with other subordinate
clause types. Topic constituents are acceptable with subordinate temporal clauses
marked by Anterior ke. However, they are not permissible within purposive clauses
marked by subjunctive li (*òjè yé òkè lí ìyòìn, ó mìè éhé rè fí ísè [Oje move.to Oke

     ‘As for the man, after he finished eating food, he sold the yam.’7.4 Right dislocation / antitopic
Right dislocation (RD) or antitopic constructions consist of two major constituents, a
matrix clause with a falling intonation contour followed by a constituent wherein a
noun phrase is preceded by Equational Identity copula khi and its obligatory Identi-
ty subject pronoun í. A right dislocated constituent functions to identify the referent
of a matrix clause grammatical relation assumed by the speaker to be unclear.(45) ólí ómóhé shén'      óì, í khì ólí émà.
     the man PAP.sell it ID be the yam
     ‘The man sold it, that is the yam.’RD constructions constrain syntactic shape of the right dislocated constituent and
restrict matrix clause inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. RD occurrence in embed-
ded or subordinate clauses is also limited. As for RD position itself, it corresponds to
grammatical relations subject, monotransitive direct object and locative argument,
with additional restrictions imposed on those relations.","[388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395]"
"3.1.1 AspectEmai articulates three clause level aspects: perfect, imperfect and prospective. Each
correlates with a distinct tonal pattern in the verb phrase. In addition, contrasting
tonal patterns in the subject phrase index event time relative to utterance time or
some discourse determined reference time. Monotransitive structures most clearly
reveal these tonal patterns.
     Perfect aspect asserts event completeness and recognizes two degrees of re-
moteness. Distal past events correlate with high downstep tone at left edge of the
verb phrase and right edge high tone in the subject phrase. Proximal past events
correlate with high tone at left edge of the verb phrase and right edge low tone in the
subject phrase. Neither shows subject concord, although a few exceptional con-
struction types exist among speaking verbs.
     Present perfect (PRP) indicates a proximal or immediate past relation between
event occurrence and time of utterance as well as an implication of present rele-
vance. In monotransitive structures in third person, PRP shows a high tone verb (é
‘eat’) and a subject phrase that is either a low tone pronoun (ò) or a lexically headed
constituent with right edge low tone (ólí ómòhè or ólí ómóhé nà).
                                             Inflectional and auxiliary categories | 101(1) a. ò é         ólí émàè.
       he PRP.eat the food
       ‘He has eaten the food.’
    b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà é           ólí émàè.
       the man      the man this PRP.eat the food
       ‘The man / This man has eaten the food.’Past perfect (PAP) specifies a distal or nonimmediate past relation between event
time and utterance time. It carries no implication of present relevance, appearing
instead to ascribe definite or emphatic character to a past event. In monotransitive
constructions inflected for PAP, verb tone is high downstep and subject phrase tone
is either high on a pronoun (ó) or right edge high on a lexically headed constituent
(ólí ómóhé, ólí ómóhé ná).(2) a. ó é'         ólí émàè.
       he PAP.eat the food
       ‘He ate the food.’
    b. ólí ómóhé / ólí ómóhé ná é'        ólí émàè.
       the man       the man this PAP.eat the food
       ‘The man / This man ate the food.’Past and Present perfect show contrasting temporal adverbs. Past perfect takes òdè
‘yesterday,’ while Present perfect accepts èghéènà ‘just recently.’ Reversal of align-
ment between adverbs and perfect type is ungrammatical.(3) a. ójé nwú'      émà lí ólí ókpósó òdè / *èghéènà.
       Oje PAP.take yam APP the woman yesterday recently
       ‘Oje gave yam to the woman yesterday.’
    b. òjè nwú       émà lí ólí ókpósó èghéènà / *òdè.
       Oje PRP.take yam APP the woman recently         yesterday
       ‘Oje has given yam to the woman just recently.’    Imperfect aspect views an event as incomplete relative to moment of utterance
or reference time. For Continuous, some temporal portion of an event is coincident
with moment of utterance. This is not necessarily the case for Habitual, where an
event is not indexed to a specific point on the time line. Each imperfect is designated
by a tonal pattern affecting subject phrase and verb phrase. In monotransitive struc-
tures, verb tone is low but subject phrase tone varies according to imperfect type.
    Continuous aspect specifies the ongoing character of an event relative to mo-
ment of utterance or reference time. In monotransitive clauses with third person
subjects, Continuous is expressed by high tone ó, verb tone is low (è) and subject
102 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsphrase exhibits a low tone pronoun (ò) or low tone subject concord (ò) following a
lexically headed constituent with right edge low tone (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).(4) a. ò ó è ólí émàè.
       he C eat the food
       ‘He is eating food.’
    b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà ò ó è ólí émàè.
       the man        the man this SC C eat the food
       ‘The man / This man is eating food.’Habitual denotes the timeless character of an event, delinking it from time axis
points. In monotransitive clauses with third person subjects, Habitual is low tone ò,
verb tone is low (shèn) and subject phrase shows a high tone pronoun (ó) or subject
concord with high tone (ó) following a lexical constituent with right edge high (ólí
ómóhé, élí ímóhé ná).(5) a. ó ò shèn úkpùn.
       he H sell cloth
       ‘He sells cloth.’
    b. ólí ómóhé / élí ímóhé ná      ó ò shèn úkpùn.
       the man       the men these SC H sell cloth
       ‘The man sells / These men sell cloth.’Imperfect Continuous and Habitual adopt adverbs with distinct temporal dimen-
sions. Continuous allows adverbial ènyáà ‘just now,’ whereas Habitual accepts ad-
verbials of frequency (sàá ‘always’) or indefinite past (éghèéghè ‘generations ago’).
Reversing this assignment is ungrammatical.(6) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émáé ènyáà / *sàá.
       the man SC C eat the food just.now always
       ‘The man is eating the food now.’
    b. ólí ómóhé ó ò è émá sàá / *ènyáà.
       the man SC H eat yam always just.now
       ‘The man always eats yam.’In construction with syntactically nonelaborated subject and direct object phrases,
Habitual expresses generic statements.(7) ívbékhán ó ò gbè àkàkà.
    youth    SC H kill grasshoppers
    ‘Youngsters kill grasshoppers.’
                                              Inflectional and auxiliary categories | 103In imperfect aspect, subject concord conveys neither number nor class agreement
vis-à-vis its subject noun phrase. Concord form is constant across lexical subjects
that are singular/plural (ólí ómòhè ‘the man,’ élí ímòhè ‘the men’) and hu-
man/nonhuman (ólí ómòhè, ólì ògò ‘the bush’).(8) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàè.
       the man SC C eat the food
       ‘The man is eating the food.’
    b. élí ímòhè ò ó è ólí émàè.
       the men SC C eat the food
       ‘The men are eating the food.’
    c. ólì ògò ò ó tòó.
       the bush SC C burn
       ‘The bush is burning.’    Prospective aspect, while specifying event nonoccurrence, recognizes a future
event with two degrees of remoteness: proximal and distal. It is expressed by high
tone ló and contrasting tonal patterns on the subject.
    Predictive ló ‘will’ allows the speaker to claim that a future event will occur at a
point distal to reference time. In bare monotransitives inflected for Predictive, verb
tone is low (è) and subject phrase tone is either high on a pronoun (ó) or right edge
high for a lexically headed constituent (ólí ómóhé, ólí ómóhé ná).(9) a. ó ló      è ólí émàè.
       he PRED eat the food
       ‘He will eat the food.’
    b. ólí ómóhé / ólí ómóhé ná ló          è ólí émàè.
       the man        the man this PRED eat the food
       ‘The man / This man will eat the food.’Anticipative ló reflects a speaker claim that an event will occur at a future point
proximal to reference time. It translates ‘about to.’ In bare monotransitives, verb
tone is low (è) and subject tone is low on a pronoun (ò) or right edge low for a lexical
constituent (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).(10) a. ò ló      è ólí émàè.
        he ANTI eat the food
        ‘He is about to eat the food.’
     b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà ló          è ólí émàè.
        the man        the man this ANTI eat the food
        ‘The man / This man is about to eat the food.’
104 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsProspective types accept distinct temporal adverbs. Predictive ló allows ákhò ‘to-
morrow’ but not ènyáà ‘just now.’ Anticipative ló allows adverb ènyáà but not ákhò.(11) a. ólí ómóhé ló      è ólí émáé ákhò / *ènyáà.
        the man PRED eat the food tomorrow just.now
        ‘The man will eat the food tomorrow.’
     b. ólí ómòhè ló      è ólí émáé ènyáà / *ákhò.
        the man ANTI eat the food just.now tomorrow
        ‘The man is about to eat the food just now.’3.1.2 Predicate negationNegative inflection is expressed by three mutually exclusive forms: Perfect ì, Pro-
spective khà and Past Absolute yà. Each occurs with a subject pronoun or subject
concord í and a lexically headed subject phrase.
     Perfect Negation (NEG) is expressed by low tone ì. In third person monotransi-
tive clauses, verb tone is low (è), and subject phrase tone is either high on a pro-
noun (ó) or subject concord high í follows a lexically headed constituent with right
edge low tone (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).(12) a. ó ì      è émàè.
        he NEG eat food
        ‘He did not eat food.’
     b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà í ì             è ólí émàè.
        the man        the man this SC NEG eat the food
        ‘The man / This man is not eating the food.’Phonological shape of the Perfect Negation morpheme is constant across nomina-
tive pronouns, except for second singular [ù], and restrictive third plural [è].(13) a. í ì    / ú ù / ó ì           è ólí émàè.
        I NEG you NEG he NEG eat the food
        ‘I / You / He did not eat the food.’
     b. má ì       / vbá ì / yán ì         / é   è     è ólí émàè.
        we NEG you NEG they NEG they NEG eat the food
        ‘We / You / They / They did not eat the food.’    Negative inflection takes two other shapes, both referring to events temporally
removed from utterance time. Prospective Negation (PRONEG) codes events that
project to a point subsequent to time of utterance. It translates ‘will not’ and relies
                                            Inflectional and auxiliary categories | 105on low tone khà, which also expresses epistemic Hypothetical.1 In third person
monotransitive clauses, Prospective Negation verb tone is low (è) and subject
phrase tone is either high for a pronoun (ó) or subject concord high tone í follows a
lexically headed constituent with right edge low tone (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).(14) a. ó khà         è ólí émàè.
        he PRONEG eat the food
        ‘He will not eat the food.’
     b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà í         khà      è ólí émàè.
        the man        the man this SC PRONEG eat the food
        ‘The man / This man will not eat the food.’Also removed from time of utterance is Past Absolute Negation (PANEG). It is sig-
naled by low tone yà ‘never.’2 In third person monotransitives, verb tone is low
(shèn) and subject phrase tone is either high on a pronoun (ó) or high tone subject
concord í follows a lexically headed constituent with right edge low tone (ólí
ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).(15) a. ó yà        shèn úkpùn.
        he PANEG sell cloth
        ‘He never sells cloth.’
     b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà í yà           shèn úkpùn.
        the man       the man this SC PANEG sell cloth
        ‘The man / This man never sells cloth.’    Negation of affirmative imperative commands is expressed by Prohibition con-
structions. The Prohibitive (PR) morpheme è exhibits low tone. It requires a second
person subject pronoun, either singular form é or plural vbá, both showing high
tone. In bare monotransitives, verb tone (é) is high.(16) a. é è é ólí émàè.
        you PR eat the food
        ‘Don't eat the food.’
     b. vbá è é ólí émàè.
        you PR eat the food
        ‘Don't eat the food.’
106 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs3.1.3 ModalityEmai deontic and epistemic forms exhibit contrasting distribution and tonal pat-
terns. There is one deontic form and six epistemic forms. Within and across modali-
ty types, auxiliaries combine. Deontic Hortative use assumes that an obligation
relation exists between grammatical subject and clausal event. Showing high tone í,
it induces left edge low tone of the immediately following constitutent. Epistemic
auxiliaries convey speaker judgment about degree of probability or certainty of
proposition truth value (Palmer 2001). Three judgment types occur: rational (Deduc-
tive za, Resultative za), speculative (Certaintive ma, Dubitative vba, Dubitative bia)
and assumptive (Concessive rere/re, Hypothetical kha). Epistemic forms fail to in-
duce left edge low tone in a following constituent.","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"

Number is inflectionally marked on noun phrase head, its modifier, both or neither.

168 | Noun modifiers4.2      Phrasal classifiers
Noun phrases with a complex internal structure consist of a classificatory form and
a following noun. The classifiers are dependent forms with singular reference and
their accompanying nominal positions do not take a count noun overtly marked as
plural. All classificatory forms show the effect of high tone spread when their fol-
lowing nominal shows a left edge high tone.
    As to semantic profile, Emai classifier forms reflect either perceptual or func-
tional properties. They exploit three physical semantic features: size with the values
big and small, arrangement and quanta with the values bundle of and bunch of, and
nondiscrete consistency of mass with low utility expressed by the values fragment of
and remains of. Semantic functional values of classifier forms highlight value judg-
ment and gatherability.
    Classifier forms exhibit a number of distinguishing syntactic properties. In
complex noun phrases, classifiers occur with a syntactically bare noun in nominal
position. Included are the size forms údù and úvbì, the arrangement and quanta
forms úkhùn and úhììn, the consistency forms ésèmí and úgógò and the functional
forms égbègbé and ògùì.údú émà ‘big yam’                        úvbí éwè ‘small goat’
úkhùn èvò ‘bundle of thatch’             úhíín édìn ‘palmnut bunch’
ésémí úkpùn ‘fragment of cloth’          úgógò àsè ‘remains of a hut’
égbègbé úkpùn ‘good cloth’               ógúí ítùú ‘mushroom gathering’    In their nominal position, classifier phrases accept expletive pronoun óì, phono-
logically identical to the third person singular direct object pronoun óì ‘him/her/it.’
Since the nominal slot rejects third person plural direct object pronoun íyàìn, num-
ber and person expression for this slot are neutralized.údú óì ‘big one’                         úvbí óì ‘small one’
úkhún óì ‘bundle of it’                  úhíín óì ‘bunch of it’
ésémí óì ‘fragment of it’                úgógó óì ‘remains of it’
égbègbé óì ‘good one’                    ógúí óì ‘gathering of it’     Physical and functional classifier phrases are differentially constrained with re-
spect to nominal modifiers. Only physical feature classifiers accept modifiers; classi-
fier phrases that evoke functional features reject nominal modifiers. Physical classi-
fiers co-occur with predeterminers and postdeterminers. The classifier forms údù
‘big,’ úvbì ‘small,’ úkhùn ‘bundle of,’ úhììn ‘bunch of,’ ésèmì ‘fragment of,’ and úgógò
‘remains of’ take a preceding definite article (ólì ‘the sg’) as well as the kindred
postdeterminer (élìyó ‘kind of’).

‘the remains of a hut’                  ‘remains that kind’     The functional classifiers égbègbé ‘good’ and ògùì ‘activity of,’ on the other
hand, reject the definite article and the kindred modifier: *ólí égbègbé úkpùn ‘the
good cloth,’ *égbègbé úkpún élìyó ‘good cloth that kind,’ *ólí ógúí ítùú ‘the gathering
of mushrooms,’ *ógúí ítùú élìyó ‘gathering mushrooms of that kind.’
     Classifier distribution reveals substantial variability with accompanying nomi-
nal types. As opposed to physical classifiers, functional classifiers reveal a highly
restrained nominal position. Functional form égbègbé occurs with inanimate and
animate nouns; it fails with human, location or abstract nouns. Within a complex
noun phrase, égbègbé's tone value is constant (H L H); its final vowel elides.égbègbé úkpùn                           égbègbé éwè
good     cloth                          good     goat
‘good, decent cloth’                    ‘good goat’Functional ògùì only combines with inanimate nouns identifying culturally signifi-
cant activities such as gathering wood or mushrooms. Some of these nouns can be
inflectionally marked as plural (e.g. óràn ‘wood sg,’ éràn ‘wood pl’). In addition,
ògùì appears with gerundive phrases (óràn úvòómì [wood fetching] ‘fetching wood’).
Within its phrase, ògùì undergoes high tone spread and its final vowel elides.ógúí         ítùú                       ógúí         éràn

‘activity of bearing fruit’             ‘activity of fetching firewood’
170 | Noun modifiersDistribution of ògùì phrases is controlled by locative subcategorization. Relevant
phrases occur as complements of locative preposition vbi or of verbs subcategorized
for a locative direct object (e.g. ye ‘move to,’ le ‘depart for’).(1) a. élí ívbèkhàn ríì       vbí ógúí       ítùú.

       wood fetching PF the man PAP.depart.for activity.of it
       ‘It is fetching wood that the man tended to.’    Physical feature classifiers do not exhibit uniform co-occurrence potential with
regard to human, animate, inanimate, location and abstract nouns as their nominal.
Abstract and locus nouns are heavily restricted. Human and animate nouns are
more restricted than inanimate nouns.
    Augmentative classifier údù/ídù, which evokes the size feature big, co-occurs
only with inanimate nouns and body-part loci.1 Within a noun phrase, it conveys
number through vowel alternation of an initial prefix.2 The augmentative undergoes
high tone spread and its final vowel forms a labiovelar glide. Interestingly, the cul-
turally prominent noun ìbòbòdí ‘cassava’ does not allow augmentative údù/ídù.","[193, 194, 195, 196]"

  That ga ze consists of two distinct morphemes is shown by monotransitive clauses with the sense
‘meet’ or ‘pace up to,’ where a direct object occurs beween the two morphemes.(i) a. òjè gá         àlèkè zé.
       Oje PRP.meet Aleke
       ‘Oje met Aleke.’
    b. òjè gá         ólí émà zé.
       Oje PRP.meet the yam
       ‘Oje paced up to / encountered the yam.’
872 | Embedded S- and VP-complements
The sense of each morpheme is not obvious. The form ga with a single vowel has the sense ‘worship,
serve obediently,’ neither of which appears related to the sense ‘meet, encounter.’ However, the
double vowel form gaa with its sense ‘collect’ conveys movement toward an entity, which jibes with
the meaning ‘pace up to, encounter.’(ii) òjè gáá          àmè.
     Oje PRP.collect water
     ‘Oje collected water.’As for ze, its possible derivation is discussed in Chapter 11, 11.9.5., where the ‘togetherness’ sense of
the reduplicated form zeze ‘congeal, become stiff’ is advanced as a possible remnant of an earlier
nonreduplicated form that conveyed the sense of separate parts coming together.(iii) a. ólì àkàsán     zézé'-ì.

         ‘The maize pap congealed.’

   As a brief addendum, verbs of human sensory experience convey immediate perception through
two complement strategies. Their impression role can be realized as S-complement or lexical NP
complement of a simple or complex predicate. Complement differences aside, each immediate
sensory experience construction requires a first person matrix subject and Continuous aspect.(i) a. ì á hón khí ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó vìé.
       I C hear IND the youth          SC C cry
       ‘I hear the youth crying.’
    b. ì á záwó khí ólí óvbèkhàn khì ò ó vìé.

       ‘I am touching the cutlass.’
    e. ì á yàà íìghòn.
       I C smell smoke
       ‘I am smelling smoke.’To convey ongoing perception by third person subject, each verb except hon and zawo requires
imperfect aspect, typically the Continuous.(ii) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó rè ómí fèè únú    ghòó.
        the man SC C use soup try mouth inspect
        ‘The man is tasting soup.’

     c. ólí ómòhè ò ó yàà íìghòn.
        the man SC C smell smoke
        ‘The man is smelling smoke.’18
  zawo appears to be a complex morphological form originally composed of za and ghoo, the former
being the epistemic Deductive auxiliary and the latter the predicate for ‘perceive.’
14 Multi-clause constructions
Multi-clause constructions in Emai subordinate one clause to another or conjoin two
or more independent clauses. Emai conjunction shows distinct contrastive and dis-
junctive forms. Of these, disjunction is the more syntactically restricted. In addition,
separate contrastive forms exist for sentences and S-Complements. There is no form
for clause conjunction.
     To express subordination, Emai relies on grammatical category types that in-
clude verbs, auxiliaries, nouns and complementizers. These grammatical resources
are not uniformly distributed across subordinate clause types of the sort identified
in Shopen (1985), aligning as indicated in Table 7.","[897, 898, 899, 900]"
"20
   The verb forms khaan and gba appear as simple transitive predicates with direct objects that
undergo a change of state rather than simply a change of position, i.e. direct object as semantic
patient rather than semantic theme, as does khuye with its sense ‘close’ (Chapter 11, 11.9.5 for illus-
tration of khaan and khuye as predicates).(i) a. òjè ò ó khààn àgá.
       Oje SC C pound chair
       ‘Oje is pounding the chair together (to nail by pounding together).’
    b. ólì òkpòsò gbá       ògbèlè.
       the woman PRP.tie baby.sash
       ‘The woman tied on the baby sash.’21
  In contrast to the contact end state V2 forms khuan and gon, the form nye does not occur as an
intransitive predicate with verb de in series.(i) *òhí dé'        nyé-í         vbí ólí óràn.
     Ohi PAP.fall move.against-F LOC the tree
     ‘Ohi fell against the tree.’22
  A verb form phonologically related to nye shows an obligatory reduplicative form. nyenye occurs
as an intransitive or transitive shape with change of existence state re in series. Encoded as ‘push
out, protrude,’ predication sense reflects a sustained position change rather than contact.(i) a. òjè nyényé      ékéìn ré.
       Oje PRP.push belly rise
       ‘Oje pushed out his belly.’
    b. ékéín ísì òjè nyényé        ré'.
       belly ASS Oje PRP.push rise
       ‘Oje's belly protruded.’23
     Moreover, baa does not form complex predicates with CS a or APP li/ni.(i) a. *ólí ómòhè báá         élì àgbèdé á.
        the man PRP.add.to the needle CS
        ‘The man mixed up the needles.’
    b. *ólí ómòhè báá         àgbèdé lí      àlèkè.
        the man PRP.add.to needle APP Aleke
         ‘The man added a needle for Aleke.’
12 Transitivity and verb arguments
Verb transitivity in Emai gets reshaped by detransitive predications, which reduce
the argument profile of a predication, and double object predications, which aug-
ment argument profile. Detransitives are morphosyntactically marked by preposi-
tion vbi and its complement, an erstwhile direct object. Double object predications
(with e.g. fi ‘hit’) consist of juxtaposed noun phrases, the first of which is headed by
a human or animate noun and the second by an inanimate or abstract noun. Often,
the second object serves as direct object in a corresponding transitive predication,
as examples in the following sections indicate.(1) a. òjè é          vbí ólí émà.
       Oje PRP.eat LOC the yam
       ‘Oje ate from the pounded yam.’
    b. òhí fí'        ójé úkpóràn.
       Ohi PAP.hit Oje stick
       ‘Ohi hit Oje with a stick.’12.1 Detransitive predications
Detransitive predications are characterized by preposition vbi immediately follow-
ing a lexically transitive verb. Each detransitive predication contrasts with a transi-
tive predication.(2) a. òjè é         vbí ólí émà.
       Oje PRP.eat LOC the yam
       ‘Oje ate from the pounded yam.’
    b. òjè é          ólí émà.
       Oje PRP.eat the yam
       ‘Oje ate the pounded yam.’
    c. ólì òkpòsò húá          vbí élí íkpùn.
       the woman PRP.take LOC the clothes
       ‘The woman carried some of the clothes.’
    d. ólì òkpòsò húá          élí íkpùn.
       the woman PRP.take the clothes
       ‘The woman carried the clothes.’While transitive predications show a direct object realized by a personal pronoun
(óì), detransitives exhibit a vbi complement that manifests nondeictic locative pro-
776 | Transitivity and verb argumentsnoun (ò). Object position following vbi does not take accusative pronouns (e.g. óì) or
deictic locative pronouns (e.g. èvbò).(3) a. òjè é         óì / *ò.
       Oje PRP.eat it it
       ‘Oje ate it.’
    b. òjè é         vbí ò /*óì / *èvbò.
       Oje PRP.eat LOC it it yonder
       ‘Oje ate from it.’Detransitive predications exhibit additional properties when articulating sentence
aspect, aspectual interrogatives, realization verbs in series, verbal affixes, polarity
and mood as well as argument repositioning in discourse. Detransitive vbi predica-
tions restrict aspect. They inflect for Past and Present perfect but not imperfect Con-
tinuous.(4) a. òjè é         vbí ólí émà.
       Oje PRP.eat LOC the yam

    b. ójé é'       vbí ólí émà.

(*òjè é vbí ólí émà féé ghòò / bá kùn [Oje PRP.eat LOC the yam try.inspect pur-
sue.in.vain] ‘Oje tried to eat / unsuccessfully ate some of the pounded yam’). On
their verb, detransitive vbi predications reject Perseverative prefix Ci- (*ólí ókpósó hí-
húá vbí élí íkpùn [the woman PAP.PERS-take LOC the clothes] ‘The woman still car-
ried some of the clothes’) and Distributive suffix -lo/lo/no (*ólì òkpòsò húá-ló vbí élí

Double object predications with shape NP1 V1 NP2 NP3 reflect two types. These types
are grounded to contrasting semantic relations underlying double object construc-
tions and the consequent participant roles of each relation. Across types, the first
object (NP2) requires a human noun that is negatively impacted by its event. In addi-
tion, NP2 manifests either of two participant roles. For type one, NP2 reflects a pos-
sessor role and for type two a causative role. Alternations between double object
predications and corresponding transitive structures direct attention to the contrast
in their semantic relations.(9) a. òlólò vbí      ójé éànmì.

       ‘Ololo made Aleke his mistress / took Aleke as his mistress.’     The examples in the following sections are representative of the two double ob-
ject predication types. Nonetheless, there are additional double object constructions
(Chapter 8, 8.4.5. and 8.4.6. as well as Chapter 10, 10.12.) in which negative impact
on the first object appears to reflect more subtle cultural values.","[800, 801, 802, 803, 804]"

transitive (heen) or intransitive (shan, gbe, la). so identifies a motion subevent’s

process of some duration followed by a singular end state condition.14 Neither sense
associated with simple predicate so articulates the manner by which the end state
was achieved. In simple transitive predications, so has the sense ‘collide with, crash

Emai complex predicates assert the telic status of a change of existence state. V1
forms denote an incremental change of existence with an implied end state open to
718 | Aspect expressing complex predicatestelic specification. Existence end states manifest a distinct perceptual character
when oriented on the vertical or horizontal axis by V2 re and its ‘rise’ or ‘arrive’
sense, respectively. In effect, re expresses a change in entity existence from absence
to presence.
     With an intransitive verb, e.g. ze ‘grow,’ or a verb like filo ‘thrust’ as V1, re ‘rise’
predications assume incremental change of state on the vertical axis. They augment
intransitive subject or transitive direct object referent substance and assert percep-
tible emergence of the referent. In this respect, re predications represent the con-
verse of predications with the postverbal Change of State (CS) a particle. While CS a
predications refer to dissolution of material substance (Chapter 9, 9.3.2.1), re predi-
cations refer to emergence of substance. Predications with CS a and re refer less to
change of material state (e.g. from intactness or wholeness toward dissolution) than
to change in entity existence. For re that would be from physically absent to physi-
cally present; however, for CS a it would be from physically present to physically
absent. Translation equivalents for re ‘rise’ predications engage English forms of
emergence: prepositions out, up or verbs sprout, arise.(178) a. ólí ókà zé              ré'.

         the maize PRP.thrust-DS shoot rise
         ‘The maize has sprouted shoots.’    On the horizontal axis with V2 re ‘arrive,’ existence end state has a deictic char-
acter. The deictic reference point is the speaker or a speaker defined position, from
which perspective a change of existence state from absence to presence has oc-
curred. As V1, complex re ‘arrive’ predicates take transitive manipulation verbs or
transitive motion verbs (with attendant constraints on direct object shape).15 English
translation equivalents of predication sense rely on the verb bring or an additional
deictically centered clause of place.(179) a. ólí ókpósó nwú'     émà ré.

      the maize PRP.grow rise
      ‘The maize has sprouted / grown out.’Other simple V1 intransitives (hu ‘boil,’ san ‘become pellucid,’ ohia ‘grow’) express a

predications existence end state is closed, i.e. achieved.(181) a. ólì òmì hú          ré'.

trate, ze implies but does not assert a perceptible end state.(182) a. ólí ókà zé-ì         /    *zé.

ries.18 As V1, there occur transitive verbs of object manipulation, which in simple
predications convey a change of existence state open to deictic specification. In
complex predications, end state value is closed by telic re. Predications of this na-
ture assert that subject and direct object referents have arrived at the speaker or
some other deictic focal point, i.e. they have undergone a change of existence from
absence to presence. English translation is most often rendered by ‘bring.’(205) a. ólí ókpósó nwú'       émà ré.

series with direction verb buu ‘approach.’19 As a simple predicate, buu expresses a
change of existence state open to telic specification. Simple buu takes as direct ob-
ject accusative pronouns (e.g. óì, é) in addition to lexical nouns (e.g. òkpòsò).(214) ólí ómò búú            óì / é / ólì òkpòsò.

person accusative pronoun, i.e. mè). Complex buu re predicates do not permit as
direct object third person accusative pronouns or lexical nouns.(215) a. ólí ómò búú             mè / *é     ré.

buu take NP1 as subject and first person pronoun NP2 as direct object. Without re,
buu and a first person pronoun direct object are unacceptable.(216) *ólí ómò búú           mè.
       the baby PRP.approach me
       ‘The baby approached me.’V2 re as an intransitive shape does not occur with NP2 as subject. Similarly unac-
ceptable is transitive re with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object.(217) *í ré'-ì.       /      *ólí ómò ré           mè.

Emai complex predicates expressing a change in positional state specify telic status
with multiple V1 forms. Until signaled as telic by V1, either positional change is
incremental and aligns with simple V2 transitive verbs or position is stative and
aligns with simple V2 intransitive posture verbs. Direction of change is a function of
V2 forms and their transitive and intransitive verb meaning. Translation relies on
directional prepositions up, down, around or end state positional expressions such
as at arm’s length or flat out.(224) a. òjè nwú       ólì ùkòdò khúáé.

         the man PAP.stand-F
         ‘The man stood.’11.8.1 Transitive telic change of positional stateComplex predicates articulate a telic change of positional state. As V2, the verbs
khuae ‘raise,’ gbe ‘fell, reposition downward,’ khakha ‘spread,’ and ruan ‘tie’ occur
in series, respectively, with the V1 object manipulation verbs nwu, fi, ku and re. In
simple predications, V2 expresses an incremental change of positional state whose
final end state is open or unspecified, i.e. atelic. Addition of V1 in complex predica-
tions closes or specifies the end state. Telic specification thus differentiates simple
from complex change of positional state predications.(225) a. òjè fí             ólí óràn gbé.

730 | Aspect expressing complex predicatesTelic change of positional state predications restrict verb series co-occurrence.
While nwu khuae is grammatical, *fi khuae is disallowed. Likewise, re ruan is gram-
matical, whereas *nwu ruan is not.(226) a. *òjè fí             ólì ùkòdò khúáé.

          Aleke PRP.take wrapper tie
          ‘Alekei got heri wrapper tied around.’Typically, complex transitive change of positional state predications assert a telic
positional change for the NP2 referent. Some complex predications, however, assert
telic change for the NP1 referent (òjè ‘Oje’).(227) a. òjè nwú         ùdékèn héén.
         Oje PRP.take wall        climb

      b. òjè héén          ùdékèn.
         Oje PRP.climb wall
         ‘Oje climbed the wall.’Predications of telic positional change restrict direct object. Although a broad class
of nouns occur as direct object for V2 in simple predications, only a subset appear as
NP2 in complex predications, e.g. heen ùdékèn ‘climb the wall’ immediately above
corresponds to nwu ùdékèn heen but heen ólí óràn ‘climb the tree’ below does not
correspond to nwu ólí óràn heen.(228) a. òjè héén          ólí óràn.

appears with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object. It does not occur with NP1 or
NP2 as intransitive subject.(230) òjè khúáé       ólì ùkòdò. / *ólì ùkòdò khúáé-ì.
      Oje PRP.raise the pot         the pot    PRP.raise-F
      ‘Oje has raised the pot.’     ‘The pot got raised.’The relation of V1 to complex predication arguments is more variable. Relative to
nwu khuae, V1 nwu appears with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object and shows
the meaning ‘carry.’(231) òjè nwú        ólì ùkòdò.
      Oje PRP.take the pot
      ‘Oje carried the pot.’V1 fi (òjè fí ólí óràn gbé ‘Oje felled the tree (down) flat out’) is more problematic.
Strict deconstruction fails. Although V2 gbe ‘reposition, fell’ as a transitive shape
accepts NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object, V1 fi disallows NP1 as subject and
NP2 as direct object. Neither appears as an intransitive shape with NP1 or NP2 as
subject.(232) a. òjè gbé        ólí óràn.

          ‘Oje projected/dropped the tree.’V1 nwu (òjè nwú ùdékèn héén [Oje PRP.take.hold wall climb] ‘Oje climbed up to the
top of the wall) is also problematic. Although V2 heen ‘climb, ascend’ appears with
NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object, V1 nwu fails to accept NP1 as subject and NP2
as direct object.(233) a. òjè héén        ùdékèn.

man body. In corresponding complex predications, V2 signals end state of a posi-
tional change in posture. V1 and V2 vary in tandem. V1 expresses direction of change
(daa ‘raise,’ dee ‘lower’) and V2 the positional end state (muzan ‘stand,’ mehen ‘lie’).
Component verbs are not only paired but also strictly ordered. V2 muzan follows V1
daa, and V2 mehen follows V1 dee. Predication sense is ‘up’ or ‘down,’ respectively.(240) a. ólí ómòhè dáá       múzán'.
         the man PRP.raise stand
         ‘The man stood up.’
      b. ólí ómòhè déé       méhén'.
         the man PRP.lower lie
         ‘The man lay down.’    Complex intransitive predicates of posture change do not deconstruct in a strict
fashion. V2 muzan and mehen, retaining their posture senses, appear with NP1 as
subject and permit a locative vbi phrase.(241) a. ólí ómóhé múzán-í'      vbí úkpódè / múzán'-ì.
         the man PAP.stand-F LOC road            stand-F

         the man PAP.lie-F LOC mat         lie-F
         ‘The man lay on the mat / relaxed.’V1 occurs with NP1, but it does not occur exclusively as an intransitive verb. V1 daa
in simple transitive predications collocates with a body-part noun in direct object
position, e.g. éhòn ‘ear,’ to render English ‘listen.’ Similarly, V1 dee appears with the
verb re ‘arrive’ in series and, in the transitive, a body-part noun direct object. Both
734 | Aspect expressing complex predicatestransitive and intransitive dee re show the sense ‘lower, bend down.’ Thus neither
V1 verb occurs as a simple intransitive predication.(242) a. ólí òkpòsò ò ó dàà éhòn.
         the woman SC C raise ear
         ‘The woman is listening / is propping her ear in order to hear.’

      c. ólí òkpòsò déé         rè.
         the woman PRP.lower arrive
         ‘The woman bent down / lowered herself.’    Intransitive posture change predications disclose additional properties when
expressing aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as argument
repositioning in discourse. Intransitive posture change predications restrict aspect.
They inflect for Present perfect but not Past perfect or imperfect Continuous.(243) ólí ómòhè dáá        múzán'.
      the man PRP.raise stand

stricted. They appear as imperatives but not as prohibitives, negative statements or
polar questions.(246) dàà múzán.

       the man this alone PF he PAP.raise stand
       ‘It was this man alone who stood up.’11.9 Contact end state with locative
Emai complex predicates convey contact end state or contact exclusion. Transitive
V1 forms express change of positional state for a direct object referent while leaving
the nature of contact end state unspecified. V2, followed by a locative vbi phrase and
its referent, specifies point of contact or its exclusion for direct object and locative
referents. English translation of complex contact predications engages collocations
involving locative relational verbs (e.g. hang, lean, tie, press, stick, pound) and loca-
tive prepositions of contact (e.g. against), support (e.g. on, against), attachment (e.g.
on), inclusion/penetration (e.g. in) or exclusion (e.g. from).(248) a. òjè gbá      òhí nyé               vbí ólí óràn.

an obligatory vbi phrase. As V1, transitive verbs of contact taking human, inanimate

occur as transitive or intransitive shapes. The attachment relation affects transitive
direct object NP2 (or intransitive subject) and vbi complement. Predication sense is

with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object, or with NP1 or NP2 as intransitive sub-
ject. There is no synchronic simple predicate tu that takes these syntactic shapes

phrase convey a contact end state of penetration and inclusion. As V1, transitive
verbs occur that encode change of positional state (khuye ‘close’) or contact with an
implied change of positional state (khaan ‘pound’). The NP2 referent penetrates or is
inclusive to the vbi complement referent. No intransitive shapes appear as V1 in ze
predications. Predication sense is ‘VERB in, into.’

      Oje SC C pound chair
      ‘Oje is pounding the chair (pieces of the chair) together.’When khaan appears in complex predicates with instrument verb re in series or with

subject and NP2 as direct object.(306) a. *àlèkè zé-ì                vbì ìwè. /    *ìshé zé'-ì.

indirectly related to inclusion ze.

confined to topic position. Their corresponding position in the matrix clause re-
quires a plural anaphor (yan ‘they,’ é ‘they,’ íyàìn ‘them’). Singular resumptive pro-
nouns, such as indirect object áìn, are ungrammatical.(115) a. khì     éwé khì     ófé, yán à ò         vbí ìwè.

         ‘As for the dog and the cat, the man gave food to them.’khi phrases never appear in any matrix clause grammatical relation: subject, direct
object, indirect object, or prepositional object. Similarly, khi phrases fail to appear
in discourse-defined positions other than topic. That is, they are not found in li/ni
focus position or in antitopic position.
     Correlative constituents exhibit severe restrictions as to shape. Correlative khi
phrases link two names (khì ójé khì òhí ‘both Oje and Ohi’), two modified nouns (khì
ólí ómóhé khì ólí óvbékhán ‘both the man and the youth’) or two bare, unmodified
nouns (khì éwé khì óókhó ‘both a goat and a chicken’). Correlative phrases do not
link unmodified nouns with modified nouns (*khì ólí ómóhé khì óvbékhán ‘both the
                                                                 Conjunction | 283man and a youth’). Moreover, Correlative khi phrases require number agreement
(*khì ólí ómóhé khì élí ívbékhán ‘both the man and the youths’).
    Correlative phrases restrict positioning of lexical nouns according to animacy
and number. They correlate an animate and an inanimate noun (khì éwé mè khì
úbélé mè ‘both my goat and my gourd’), two inanimate nouns (khì ólí ókpán khì ólí
úkpún ‘both the gourd and the cloth’) or two animate nouns (khì éwé khì óókhó ‘both
a goat and a chicken’). When Correlative phrases link human and nonhuman, ani-
mate nouns, the human noun precedes the animate noun (khì ójé khì ólí áwá ‘both
Oje and the dog,’ *khì ólí áwá khì ójé). When Correlative phrases link human and
inanimate nouns, the human noun precedes the inanimate noun (khì ójé khì úbélé
‘both Oje and his gourd,’ *khì úbélé khì ójé).
    Grammatical number restrictions further impact khi Correlative constructions.
Verbs that require a plural direct object such as hua ‘take hold, carry’ accept plural
anaphors that correspond to khi Correlatives in topic position, whereas verbs de-
manding singular direct objects such as nwu ‘take hold, carry’ do not.(116) khì     úkpún khì     ókpán, ólì òkpòsò húá        íyàìn / *óì.
      CORC cloth CORC gourd the woman PRP.take them it
      ‘As for a cloth and a gourd, the woman carried them.’   Correlative phrases reveal additional restrictions when pronouns are conjoined.
Each correlative position allows only emphatic pronouns when paired with a lexical
noun, as would be expected from their restriction to topic position.(117) a. khì     íyóín khì     ólí áwá, òjè nwú         émàè ní íyàìn.

when number and animacy constraints are observed (*khì mémé khì wéwé ‘both me

Existential (EXT) constructions occur with predicates ri and e: NP ri vbi o and NP e
vbi o. They assert the existence of a referent (in the manner of a pointing gesture).
Canonical EXT constructions framed by ri exhibit three distinguishing features: an
initial right edge high tone noun phrase, a low tone verb, and a vbi complement
showing the nondeictic locative pronoun. Those formed with e manifest the same
distinguishing features except for tone marking on the initial noun phrase, which
varies according to inflection and auxiliary marking.

     b. ólì òkpòsò í ì         è vbì ò.
        the woman SC NEG be LOC it
        ‘It isn't the woman.’    EXT clauses with ri limit polarity and mood expression. Like its locative coun-
terpart, EXT ri does not accept Perfect Negation (*ómòhè í ì rì vbì ò [man SC NEG be
LOC it] ‘There isn’t a man, that we know’). As well, it fails as a polar interrogative
(*ómóhé rì vbì ò? [man PAP.be LOC it] ‘Is there a man?’). EXT ri constructions never
appear as imperatives or prohibitives.
    EXT e constructions are similarly constrained. They occur as negative state-
ments or polar interrogatives, but never as imperatives or prohibitives.(77) a. ómòhè í ì        è vbì ò.
        male SC NEG be LOC it
        ‘There isn't a male (that we knew).’
     b. ómòhè í ì        è vbì ò?
        male SC NEG be LOC it
        ‘Isn’t there a male (that we knew)?’     EXT constructions exhibit few properties normally associated with verbs. Those
with ri inflect for aspect in an irregular fashion. Since ri only takes a right edge high
tone subject phrase, it appears to inflect for the Past perfect. Its own low tone, how-
ever, is irregular. Typically, Past perfect verb tone is high downstep. EXT ri fails to
inflect for imperfect or prospective aspect. Beyond inflection, EXT constructions
with ri permit no auxiliaries and preverbs. Neither epistemic Certaintive ma, relative
tense Subsequent kpe, aspectualizer preverb Repetitive che nor evaluative preverb
kuku, among others, is acceptable (*ólí ómóhé má' / kpé' / ché' / kú'kù rì vbì ò [the
man PAP.CER SUB REP EVAL be LOC it] ‘There’s certainly / yet / again / after all the
man that we knew’).
     EXT e constructions restrict inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs somewhat dif-
ferently. They only inflect for imperfect Habitual. EXT e rejects all other aspects,
including prospective Predictive (*ómóhé ló è vbì ò [male PRED be LOC it] ‘There will
be a male’).(78) ómóhé ó ò è vbì ò.
     male SC H be LOC it
     ‘There’s (usually) a male.’
454 | Be, do, happen and haveRelative to auxiliaries, EXT e constructions allow epistemic Certaintive ma (ómòhè í ì
má è vbì ò [male SC NEG CER be LOC it] ‘There surely isn't a male that we know’) but
no other modality forms, including irrealis Hypothetical kha (*ómóhé khà é vbì ò
[male PAP.HYP be LOC it] ‘There would have been a male that we know’). Construc-
tions with EXT e reject relative tense auxiliaries, for example Subsequent kpe
(*ómòhè í ì kpé è vbì ò [male SC NEG SUB be LOC it] ‘There isn't yet a male despite
the pending condition’).
     In EXT e constructions preverbs are highly restricted. They admit evaluative ku-
ku (ómòhè í ì kùkú è vbì ò [male SC NEG EVAL be LOC it] ‘There isn't a male after all
that we know’) but no other preverb.
     EXT construction noun phrases exhibit asymmetrical properties. The position
preceding ri or e takes nominative pronouns (e.g. o). The complement of vbi, regard-
less of realis or irrealis condition, permits only the nondeictic locative pronoun o.(79) a. ó rì          vbì ò.

     b. ó ì        è vbì ò.
        he NEG be LOC it
        ‘It isn't one. / There isn’t one.’     Subject position in EXT constructions limits NP type but not animacy or its syn-
tactic shape. EXT subject allows common nouns regardless of animacy or syntactic
elaboration by, for instance, definite article ólí/élí.(80) a. ómóhé / ólí ómóhé rì            vbì ò.

modified by relative clauses. But they disallow phrases with associative ísì (*ékpá ísì

"                           ASP EVAL TEMP MD SA Q3.2.8.1 Preverb repetition
Two Emai preverbs frame one emphatic type. In nonemphatic constructions, either
Additive gbo ‘also/too’ or distal manner-demonstrative ìyó ‘that way’ precede an
otherwise unmodified verb, or a subject attributive or quantity class preverb. In
emphatic frames, gbo or ìyó precedes not only the preverb but also the verb. Em-
phatic iteration never extends to the more event-directed preverb classes aspectual-
izer and evaluative. In complex emphatic structures, gbo tends to precede the verb
and each preverb in the preverbal sequence, or it precedes only selected preverbs.
                                                             Preverb categories | 1613.2.8.2 Distribution of emphatic ìyó
Distal ìyó ‘that way’ occurs in nonemphatic constructions with verb forms as well as
preverbs for quantity, subject attributive, temporal, evaluative or aspectualizer.19
ìyó's position relative to preverb classes is split. It precedes the verb in the absence
of other preverbs. It follows (but never precedes) the classes aspectualizer (gbo),
evaluative (duu) and temporal (kpao). Relative to subject attributive (dégbe, dábo)
and quantity (dobo), ìyó precedes each but never follows either.
     In emphatic constructions, ìyó appears only with the quantity and subject at-
tributive classes. It precedes Emphatic dobo of the quantity class, and it precedes
the verb. In emphatics, ìyó never occurs between the Emphatic Reflexive and the
verb unless it also precedes the Emphatic Reflexive.(103) ólí ómóhé íyó'        dóbó óì íyó' híán ólí óràn.

dégbe as well as the verb. Likewise, it precedes both dábo and its verb. No remain-
ing preverb class, aspectualizer, evaluative or temporal, appears in emphatic frames
with ìyó.(104) a. ólí ómóhé íyó'        dé'gbè íyó' híán ólí óràn.

Aspectualizer gbo ‘too, also’ in emphatic frames further articulates relations among
preverb classes. Nonemphatic gbo occurs with verbs as well as quantity, subject
attributive, temporal, and aspectualizer forms. In nonemphatic frames, where no
other preverb is present, gbo precedes the initial verb. It also precedes classes tem-
poral, subject attributive, quantity and manner-demonstrative. gbo thus precedes
each class, except evaluative.
162 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs    In emphatic frames, gbo precedes temporal, subject attributive, and quantity
forms, although never evaluatives, as is also the case with nonemphatic frames.20
gbo occurs with temporal, subject attributive and quantity exponents to reveal the
emphatic schema EVAL / MD gbo Q / SA / TEMP gbo V. gbo appears with quantity
preverbs Emphatic Reflexive dobo and Absolute Intensifier zemi. With each, a copy
of gbo precedes the quantity preverb as well as the verb.(105) a. ólí ómòhè gbóò         dóbó óì gbó é émàè.

      the man PAP.ADD carefully ADD eat food
      ‘The man really carefully ate food too.’Relative to the temporal class in emphatic frames, gbo appears with tua. Their order
is again consistent with quantity and subject attributives: a copy of gbo precedes tua
and the verb. Neither remaining preverb class, evaluative or manner-demonstrative,
appears in gbo emphatic constructions.(107) ólí ómóhé gbó'        tùà        gbó é émàè.
      the man PAP.ADD hurriedly ADD eat food
      ‘The man really ate the food in a hurry.’3.2.8.4 Complex emphatic constructions
A still more complex pattern of emphatic iteration occurs in constructions featuring
gbo and ìyó as well as subject attributive and quantity preverbs. In nonemphatic
frames, a single instance of gbo, following Resultative auxiliary za, precedes man-
ner-demonstrative ìyó, subject attributive dégbe and quantity dobo. gbo never pre-
cedes Resultative za in these constructions.(108) ólí ómóhé zá'         gbò íyó' dé'gbè dóbó óì é émàè.

frames employing multiple preverb classes show gbo only in its leftmost preverb
position. Again, temporal and evaluative do not factor in nonemphatic complex
multi-preverb constructions.
    Evaluative and temporal aside, complex emphatic frames show one or more
copies of gbo marking each affected class across the preverb phrase. In one con-
struction gbo precedes the verb, quantity dobo, subject attributive dégbe and man-
ner-demonstrative ìyó.(109) ó gbó'         íyó' gbó dégbè        gbó dóbó óì gbó é émàè.

         Oje PAP.ADD DMD ADD carefully ADD REFL him eat the food
         ‘Oje really that way carefully ate the food by himself.’     In complex emphatic constructions, gbo behavior is consistent with the preverb
order schema: ASP EVAL TEMP MD SA Q. It is ungrammatical for gbo to precede ìyó
and the verb but not dégbe and dobo; precede dégbe and the verb but not dobo and
ìyó; precede ìyó and dobo but not dégbe and the verb; precede ìyó and dobo and the
verb but not dégbe; or precede ìyó, dégbe and the verb but not dobó.
     The distribution facts concerning gbo further refine precedence relations among
preverbs. No two instances of gbo can be separated by a preverb category not
164 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsmarked by gbo and no three instances of gbo can be separated by a preverb category
not marked by gbo. These adjacency relationships in conjunction with preverb co-
occurrence constraints and constraints operating within ìyó emphatic constructions

"                    V   MA EX MD / FQ / QU / PL TD6.1      Overview of temporal adverbials
Temporal deictic adverbials consist of morphosyntactically simple and complex
forms. They correspond to either or both of the question frames éghè re and í yi. One
class of simple temporal lexemes specifies day units or day subinterval units relative
to moment of utterance. Another class segments the time line into larger-than-day
units.
                                               Overview of temporal adverbials | 289     Morphosyntactically simple temporal adverbs express day units: òdè ‘yester-
day,’ éènà ‘today,’ and ákhò ‘tomorrow.’ All correspond to question frame éghè re,
although the day past form, i.e. ákhò ‘tomorrow,’ also shows an í yi question.
     Morphosyntactically simple and complex adverbial forms, depending on day
unit, express subintervals semantically grounded to day units. Subinterval adverbs
grounded to moment of utterance refer to immediate present (ènyáà ‘just
now/present’) and immediate past (èghéènà ‘recently’) with morphosyntactically
simple and complex forms, respectively. The corresponding information question
for immediate present is framed by í yi, and for immediate past by éghè re.
     Subinterval adverbs grounded to units for past day (ékhèdéà ‘day before yester-
day’) and future day (òtíàkhó ‘day after tomorrow’) show complex forms whose
morphological make up remains opaque. Their corresponding information question
frame is éghè re.
     Subinterval adverbs within past are morphosyntactically complex forms involv-
ing partial or complete reduplication: èdèdé ‘not long ago, a while ago,’ ìghéèghé
‘generations past, long time ago.’ Their corresponding information questions are
framed by éghè re and í yi, with the latter reserved for most distant past: ìghéèghé.
     A distal future adverbial grounded to present day is phrasal: ùsúmú éènà ‘nine
days from today.’ Its corresponding information question is éghè re.
     Simple deictic adverbs (éénà, ákhò, and òdè) combine with nominal and modifi-
er forms to shape complex adverbial phrases. Day-partitive nominal expressions
combine with day unit forms to denote one of four day divisions: égbìà ‘morning,’
ódìànmì ‘afternoon,’ énwàà ‘evening’ and ásòn ‘night.’ Their corresponding infor-
mation question frame is éghè re, although those related to òdè ‘yesterday’ also
accept í yi.égbíá éénà ‘morning of today’          ódíánmí éénà ‘afternoon of today’

énwáá òdè ‘yesterday evening’          ásón òdè ‘yesterday night’   Day-partitives also combine with subinterval day unit expressions within past
and future domains. The corresponding information question for these complex
adverbials is éghè re. Only subintervals of immediate present (i.e. ènyáà) do not
combine with day-partitives.ódíánmí èkhèdèà                        ódíánmí òtíàkhó

‘afternoon of a fortnight from today’    ‘afternoon of just now’    Day unit and day-partitive expressions do not uniformly occur with the tem-
poral predeterminer (TP) élá ‘the time unit we discussed,’ or its emphatic form élélá.
Only the morphosyntactically simple adverb for past day unit (i.e. òdè) accepts the
temporal predeterminer in its basic or emphatic form. Day-unit forms for present
(*élá éènà / *élélá éènà ‘the today we talked about’) and future (*élá ákhò / *élélá
ákhò ‘the tomorrow we discussed’) do not. Temporal adverbs modified by the tem-
poral predeterminer only correspond to information questions framed by í yi ‘which
one.’élá òdè ‘the yesterday we discussed’    élélá òdè ‘the yesterday we talked about’    The subinterval day unit within past also accepts the emphatic temporal
predeterminer. Subinterval expressions within present and future domains,
however, reject the temporal predeterminer in its basic form (*élá ùsúmú éènà ‘the
fortnight from today we discussed’) or emphatic form (*élélá òtíàkhó ‘the day after
tomorrow we discussed’).élá ékhèdéà ‘the day before yesterday we discussed’
*élá ènyáà ‘the just now moment we discussed’    Day-partitive units by themselves accept either the basic or emphatic temporal
predeterminer.élá / élélá énwáà ‘the evening discussed’
élá / élélá ásòn ‘the night we talked about’    Combined day-partitive and day unit expressions do not allow the temporal
predeterminer, regardless of the latter’s basic or emphatic form.*élá / élélá ódíánmí éénà ‘the afternoon of today we discussed’
*élá / élélá ódíánmí ákhò ‘the afternoon of tomorrow we discussed’
*élá / élélá ódíánmí òdè ‘the afternoon of yesterday we discussed’    Nominals referring to time segments exceeding a single day and modified by a
temporal phrase or clause with deictic character serve as adverbials. The forms ósè
‘week,’ ùkìn ‘month’ and úkpè ‘year’ distribute symmetrically relative to Relator li
modifying phrases and clauses that exhibit a deictic quality.

of édè ‘day.’ Some occur as complements of preposition vbi, while others do not.
Temporal adjuncts headed by éghè ‘time’ and modified by distal demonstrative áìn

corresponding direct question, preverbs accessing temporal countour, polarity,
mood and discourse repositioning. The morphosyntactically simple lexeme òdè
refers to day unit ‘yesterday.’ It appears only in Past perfect; it never occurs in Pre-
sent perfect, nor in imperfect or prospective aspect. The subinterval ékhèdéà ‘day

     Relative to mood and polarity, òdè appears in clauses structured as negative
statements (ólí ómòhè í ì è ólí émáé òdè [the man SC NEG eat the food yesterday] ‘The
man did not eat the food yesterday’) or polar questions (ólí ómóhé é' ólí émáé òdè?
[the man PAP.eat the food yesterday] ‘Did the man eat the food yesteday?’). But it
fails to occur in imperative or prohibitive clauses.
     Adverb òdè also occupies either li/ni focus position or topic position.(4) a. òdè        lí ólí ómóhé é'          ólí émàè.

       ‘Yesterday, the man ate the food.’    Temporal intervals within past not confined to day unit intervals are ìghéèghé
‘generations ago’ and èdèdé ‘not long ago.’ Their syntactic distribution is nonuni-
form. Past subinterval èdèdé occurs in the Past perfect, failing to appear in the Pre-
sent perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(5) ólí ómóhé é'        ólí émáé èdèdé.

izer preverbs ya (ólí ómóhé yà é ólí émá èdèdé [the man PAP.PA eat the yam

294 | Adverbial adjuncts     èdèdé’s distribution as to polarity and mood is restricted. It occurs in clauses
expressing perfect negation (ólí ómòhè í ì è ólí émáé èdèdé [the man SC NEG eat the

ómóhé é' ólí émáé èdèdé? [the man PAP.eat the food not.long.ago] ‘Did the man eat

their Ingressive and Egressive functions.
    Regarding polarity and mood, ìghéèghé is restricted. It appears in polar ques-
tions inflected for Habitual (á à sì ìkìtìbé ìghéèghé? [one H inhale.with pipe long.ago]
‘Do generations ago inhale with pipes?’). It also occurs with Past Absolute negation
(á yà sì ìkìtìbé ìghéèghé [one PANEG inhale.with pipe long.ago] ‘Pipes were never
inhaled generations ago’), not perfect negation. ìghéèghé fails in imperatives and
prohibitives.
    As to discourse, ìghéèghé appears in topic position but not in li/ni focus posi-

     ‘In the long ago past, pipes were inhaled.’     The lexeme for day unit ‘tomorrow’ is ákhò. Its subinterval is expressed by the
morphologically opaque derivative òtíàkhó ‘day after tommorrow.’ ákhò is confined
to prospective aspect, appearing in clauses inflected for Predictive and Anticipative.
It fails in either perfect or imperfect aspect.(11) a. ólí ómóhé ló       è ólí émáé ákhò.

     ‘Tomorrow.’     The distribution of ákhò reveals additional semantic and syntactic properties.
ákhò accepts no functions associated with phasal aspectualizers ya and mo, includ-
ing their respective Ingressive (*ólí ómòhè yà é ólí émáé ákhò [the man PRP.IG eat

sive functions (*ólí ómòhè móò é ólí émáé léé ákhò [the man PRP.EG eat the food
TEMP tomorrow] ‘The man almost finished eating the food tomorrow’).
     With regard to polarity and mood, ákhò is the least restricted day unit adverb. In
polarity constructions, ákhò requires Prospective negation kha (ólí ómòhè í khà è ólí
émáé ákhò [the man SC PRONEG eat the food tomorrow] ‘The man will not eat the
food tomorrow’) and appears in polar questions framed by Predictive aspect (ólí
ómóhé ló è ólí émáé ákhò? [the man PRED eat the food tomorrow] ‘Will the man eat
the food tomorrow?’).
     ákhò also appears in imperatives (è ólí émáé ákhò ò [eat the food tomorrow INT]
‘Eat the food tomorrow, you know’ (you will not expect to but do)) and prohibitives
(é è é émáé ákhò ò [you PR eat food tomorrow INT] ‘Don't eat food tomorrow, you
296 | Adverbial adjunctswill expect to but don’t’). However, it does so only with the contrary-to- expectation
interjection o.

        tomorrow the man PRED eat the food
        ‘Tomorrow, the man will eat the food.’    A distal subinterval within day unit ‘tomorrow’ is ùsúmú éènà ‘nine days from

    With polarity and mood, ùsúmú éènà is unrestricted. Regarding polarity, ùsúmú
éènà requires prospective negation kha (ólí ómòhè í khà yè ólí ímé ùsúmú éènà [the

[the man PRP.EG kill leopard just.recently] ‘The man almost finished killing the
leopard just recently’). It rejects their Past Absolute functions.
300 | Adverbial adjuncts     Concerning polarity and mood, èghéènà is limited to affirmative declarative
statements. It does not occur in imperatives or prohibitives. Nor does it appear in
clauses expressing perfect negation or polar questions (*ólí ómòhè gbé ékpén
èghéènà? [the man PRP.kill leopard just.recently] ‘Has the man killed a leopard just
recently?’). There is a related polar question that can be formed by extraposing
èghéènà and its clause in a Specifier copular óó construction (àtà óó khí ólí ómóhé
gbé' ékpén èghéènà? [truth be IND the man PAP.kill leopard just.recently] ‘Is it true
that the man killed the leopard just recently?’).
     èghéènà’s discourse repositioning is not restricted. It occupies focus or topic po-
sition.(25) a. èghéènà        lí ólí ómóhé gbé'        èkpèn.

        ‘Just recently, the man killed a leopard.’    Adverbials headed by nominals referring to larger-than-day segments of time
are formed with ósè ‘week,’ ùkìn ‘month’ and úkpè ‘year.’ They are grounded to fu-
ture or past time depending on modifier type. When accompanied by a relative
clause incorporating the verb series raa re ‘pass,’ they exhibit a distributional pat-
tern similar to òdè ‘yesterday.’ Thus, ósè,’ ùkìn and úkpè relative clause adverbials
accept Past perfect but not Present perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(26) a. ólí ómóhé é'         ólí émáé ósé lí ó ráá'       rè.

alizer preverbs ya and mo, particularly Past Absolute: *ólí ómóhé yà gbé ófé

        ‘In the past week / month / year, Oje killed a rat.’     Larger-than-day adverbials grounded to future time with ósè ‘week,’ ùkìn
‘month’ and úkpé ‘year’ assume two additional shapes. They are framed by relator
phrase lì òdè or by definite article ólí and proximal demonstrative nà. These shapes
are aspectually restricted. Larger-than-day adverbials take only prospective Predic-
tive, not Anticipative and not perfect or imperfect aspect.(29) a. ólí ómóhé ló       gbè ólí ófé ósé / úkín / úkpé lì òdè.

perfect negation (ólí ómòhè í ì gbè ófé élá úkpè [the man SC NEG kill rat TP year] ‘The

        ‘In the year we discussed, the man killed the rat.’    There are additional adverbials that show unique temporal reference. The com-
plex adverbial úkpèénà ‘this season’ appears derived from úkpè ‘year’ and éènà
‘today’ or possibly úkpè ‘year’ and nà ‘this.’ It refers to recent past or distal future. It
does not accept any modifiers.
    úkpèénà occurs in clauses inflected for Present perfect or prospective Predictive,

        ‘As for this season, the man will plant yam then.’    Temporal adverbials of another type are framed by nominal éghè ‘time.’ It heads
an adverbial phrase with anaphoric function when modified by definite predeter-
miner ólí or distal demonstrative áìn ‘that.’2
    éghé áìn and ólí éghè phrases serve as anaphors in narrative discourse. They
show an emphatic appositive relation to a preceding temporal condition kha clause,
which serves as antecedent.(39) a. ò khà        gbé ófè léé,    éghé áìn, ò váló             óì.

306 | Adverbial adjuncts     The nominal éghé áìn ‘those times’ with plural significance also heads an ad-
verbial phrase with indefinite reference. Neither proximal (nà ‘these’) nor contras-
tive (nóì ‘other’) demonstrative co-occur with éghè in such an adverbial phrase.(40) ójé ó ò khù íhúá          éghé áìn / *éghé nà / *éghé nóì.

     ‘Three days.’        ‘He cut wood for three days.’     Additional properties of temporal duration adverbials emerge from selected
constructions. íkpédè duration adverbials appear in imperatives (rè íkpédè èéà híán
órán [take days three wood wood] ‘Take three days to cut wood / Cut wood for three
days’), where the temporal phrase occurs as complement of re ‘take,’ but not in
prohibitives, negative statements or polar questions (*ólí ómóhé híán' órán íkpédè
èéà? [the man PAP.cut wood days three] ‘Did the man cut wood for three days?’).
     íkpédè duration adjuncts fail with either function of aspectualizer ya (*ólí ómòhè

man PRP.EG cut wood days three] ‘The man almost completed cutting wood for

     In discourse, durative íkpédè adjuncts fail to occupy focus or topic position.
This condition prevails even when re ‘take’ in series appears in the matrix clause.(54) a. *íkpédè èéà lí ólí ómóhé ré'              híán óràn.

a complement consisting of the relational noun ékéín ‘inside’ followed by nominal
úkpédè/íkpédè ‘day’ and a cardinal numeral. Anchored to the moment of utterance
                                               Overview of temporal adverbials | 311or other acknowledged reference point, these phrases establish a temporal bound
within which an event occurs and beyond which it does not. Constructions with
temporal bound adverbials require a predicate phrase referring to an internally
bounded event, as happens with the bounded verb u óì ‘do it’ or with unbounded
hian ‘cut’ in construction with postverbal Temporal Perspective lee.(55) a. ójé ú'        óí vbí ékéín íkpédè èéà.

        Oje PRED cut the wood TEMP LOC inside days three

íkpédé ‘day’ and ékà ‘quantity, how many’ or í yi ‘which one.’(57) *ékéín íkpédé ékà     ó (ré')        híán ólí óràn léé?

      ‘Within how many days did he finish cutting the wood?’
     *ékéín íkpédè èéà.
      inside days three
      ‘Within three days.’     Additional properties of temporal bound adjuncts arise in selected construc-
tions. Clauses with vbí ékéín íkpédè adverbials occur as imperatives (rè ékéín íkpédè
èéà híán ólí óràn léé [take inside days three cut the wood TEMP] ‘Finish cutting the
wood within three days’), where the temporal phrase occurs as complement of verb
re ‘take’ in series. Bound vbí ékéín íkpédè adverbials fail as prohibitives, negative
statements or polar questions.
     Temporal bound adjuncts fail to co-occur with any functions of boundary aspec-
tualizer preverbs ya (*ólí ómóhé yà híán óràn léé vbí ékéín íkpédè èéà [the man

         ‘As for three days, Oje finished cutting the wood within it.’6.1.5 Temporal frequency adverbsTemporal frequency adverbials occur in morphosyntactic shapes derived from a
cardinal numeral. Articulating event frequency or iteration, they correspond to ísékà
‘how often’ direct questions and fall into four subclasses.
     Members of one subclass reflect a definite, absolute frequency value. Morpho-
logically definite frequency forms are expressed as synthetic compounds consisting
of a numeral preceded by prefix ì- and the verb se ‘reach.’ There is no evidence of a
restriction on numeral participation in this morphological shape.ìsòkpá ‘once’                            ìsèéá ‘thrice’
ìsèvá ‘twice’                            ìsèélè ‘four times’Absolute frequency adverbs occur in clauses inflected for Past perfect and prospec-
tive Predictive. They reject Present perfect, imperfect and Anticipative.(59) a. ólí ómóhé é'        émáé ìsèvá.
        the man PAP.eat food twice
        ‘The man ate food twice.’
     b. ólí ómóhé ló      è ólí émáé ìsòkpá.
        the man PRED eat the food once
        ‘The man will eat the food once.’Absolute frequency adverbs correspond to direct questions framed by ísékà.
                                                 Overview of temporal adverbials | 313(60) ísékà     ólí ómóhé é'         émàè?
     how.often the man PAP.eat food
     ‘How often did the man eat food?’
     ìsèvá.
     twice
     ‘Twice.’     Additional properties of absolute frequency adverbs emerge in selected con-
structions. They appear in imperatives (è ólí émáé ìsòkpá [eat the food once] ‘Eat the
food at once’) and prohibitives (é è é ólí émàè léé ìsòkpá [you PR eat the food TEMP
once] ‘Don't finish eating the food all at once’). However, absolute frequency ad-
verbs never occur in negative statements or polar questions.
     Absolute frequency adverbs never accept either function of aspectualizers ya
(*ólí ómòhè yà é ólí émáé ìsèvá [the man PRP.IG eat the food twice] ‘The man almost
started to eat the food twice’) and mo (*ólí ómòhè móò é ólí émáé ìsèvá [the man
PRP.EG eat the food twice] ‘The man almost completed eating the food twice’).
     Discourse repositioning of absolute frequency adverbs is partially restricted.
They occupy focus position but not topic position.(61) ìsèvá lí ólí ómóhé é'          ólí émàè.
     twice PF the man PAP.eat the food
     ‘It was twice that the man ate the food.’    A second subclass of the temporal frequency adverbial type appears as a day
partitive phrase. Members are headed by an absolute frequency adverb followed by
a vbi phrase whose complement is the derived nominal úkpédè ‘day.’ Partitive fre-
quency adverbials appear in clauses inflected for imperfect Habitual, but not Con-
tinuous, perfect or prospective aspect.(62) yán à khùàn ífí ísì ìyáín ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè.
     they H set       trap ASS their once LOC day
     ‘They set their trap once per day.’Partitive frequency adverbials correspond to ísékà direct questions.(63) ísékà      yán à khùàn ífí       ísì ìyáín?
     how.often they H set       trap ASS their
     ‘How often do they set their traps?’
     ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè.
     once LOC day
     ‘Once per day.’
314 | Adverbial adjuncts    Additional properties of partitive frequency adverbials emerge from selected
constructions. Regarding mood and polarity, partitive frequency adverbials do not
appear in imperatives, prohibitives, negative statements or polar questions, as polar
questions suggest (e.g.*yán à khùàn ífí ísì ìyáín ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè? [they H set trap
ASS their once LOC day] ‘Did they set their trap once per day?’).
    Partitive frequency adjuncts fail with all functions of aspectualizer preverbs ya
(*yán yà khúán ífí ísì ìyáín ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè [they PAP.PA set trap ASS their once
LOC day] ‘They used to set their traps once per day’) and mo (*yán mó khúán ífí ísì
ìyáín ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè [they PAP.PA set trap ASS their once LOC day] ‘They at one
time set their traps once per day’).
    Discourse repositioning of partitive frequency adverbials is restricted. They ap-
pear as a phrasal unit in focus position but not in topic position.(64) ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè lí yán à khùàn ífí ísì ìyáín.
     once LOC day           PF they H set       trap ASS their
     ‘It is once per day that they set their trap.’     A third subclass of frequency adverbials establishes an indefinite temporal
frame for an event. Members are either monomorphemic (sàá) or reduplicated forms
of temporal base nouns (édè ‘day’ and éghè ‘time’).édèédè ‘daily’                           sàá ‘always’
éghèéghè ‘all the time, every time’Indefinite frequency adverbs appear only in clauses inflected for imperfect Habitual.
They reject Continuous, perfect and prospective aspect.(65) ólí ómóhé ó ò è émáé édèédè / éghèéghè /                sàá.
     the man SC H eat food daily              all.the.time   always
     ‘The man eats food daily / all the time / always.’Indefinite frequency adverbs correspond to ísékà questions with Habitual aspect
and a partitive vbi phrase incorporating a temporal noun.(66) ísékà      ólí ómóhé ó ò è émá vbí úkpè?
     how.often the man SC H eat yam LOC year
     ‘How often in the year does the man eat yam?’
     ó ò è émá édèédè / éghèéghè / sàá.
     he H eat yam daily         all.the.time always
     ‘He eats yam daily / all the time / always.’

structions. Concerning polarity and mood, indefinite frequency adverbs appear in
polar questions (ólí ómóhé ó ò è émáé édèédè? [the man SC H eat food daily] ‘Does
the man eat food daily?’). They fail in imperatives, prohibitives and negatives.
    Indefinite frequency adverbs do not allow any functions associated with aspec-
tualizers ya (*ólí ómóhé yà é émáé édèédè [the man PAP.PA eat food daily] ‘The man
used to eat food daily’) and mo (*ólí ómóhé mó' é émáé édèédè [the man PAP.PA eat
food daily] ‘The man at one time ate food daily’).
    Adverbs in the indefinite frequency subclass show limited repositioning in dis-
course. All but sàá occupy focus position, although éghèéghè requires that its matrix
clause show verb re ‘take’ in series. No indefinite frequency adverb serves as topic.(67) a. édèédè lí má à è émà.
         daily PF we H eat yam
         ‘It is daily that we eat yam.’
     b. éghèéghè lí ó ò rè várè vbí ààn.

         ‘It is all the time that he comes here.’

         always PF the man SC H eat yam
         ‘It is always the case that the man eats yam.’     A fourth subclass of temporal frequency consists of negative polarity ghè. It re-
quires perfect negation (ólí ómòhè í ì sé gbè ófé ghè [the man SC NEG DUR kill rat
ever] ‘The man still did not ever kill rats’), although internally bounded verb gbe
‘kill’ also necessitates Durative aspectualizer se. ghè disallows prospective negation
kha (*ólí ómòhè í khà è ólí émáé ghè [the man SC PRONEG eat the food ever] ‘The
man will not eat the food ever’) and past absolute negation ya (*ólí ómòhè í yà è émá
ghè [the man SC PANEG eat yam ever] ‘The man never ever eats yam’).
     Adverb ghè never appears in affirmative constructions with perfect, imperfect or
prospective aspect. Its corresponding direct question shows ísékà and Durative se.(68) ísékà        ólí ómóhé sé'           gbé ófè?
     how.often the man PAP.DUR kill rat

316 | Adverbial adjuncts    Negative polarity ghè fails in imperatives, prohibitives and polar questions (*ólí
ómòhè í ì sé gbè ófé ghè? [the man SC NEG DUR kill rat ever] Did the man still not
ever kill rats?’).
    In discourse, ghè is also limited. It never occurs in focus or topic position.(69) *ghè lí ólí ómòhè í ì         sé      gbè ófè.
      ever PF the man SC NEG DUR kill rat
      ‘It was never that the man still killed a rat.’6.1.6 Temporal extent adverbsTemporal extent adverbs specify the temporal length of an event relative to event
onset. Morphologically, some extent adverbs exhibit triplication: títítí ‘a long time,’
and kékéké ‘continuously;’ others do not, e.g. wèéé ‘short time.’ Temporal extent
adverbs correspond to the question frame ébé' ~ ébí'...i... tee se ‘how long.’
    Temporal extent adverbs appear in clauses inflected for Past perfect. They reject
Present perfect as well as imperfect and prospective aspect.(70) a. ólí ómóhé múzán-í'      títítí.
        the man PAP.wait-F long.time
        ‘The man waited for a long time.’
     b. ólí ómóhé múzán-í'      wèéé.
        the man PAP.wait-F short.time
        ‘The man waited for a short time.’Temporal extent adverbs serve as responses to the direct question frame
ébé'/ébí'...i...tee se. Responses require temporal extent adverbs in situ in declarative
constructions. Simple adverb phrase responses are unacceptable.(71) ébé' ólí ómóhé í'            mùzàn téé        sè?

     ‘He waited for a long time.’          ‘For a long time.’    Temporal extent adjuncts are highly selective in their occurrence with verbs,
even those with inherently durative capability like vie ‘cry.’

      the youth      PAP.cry-F long.time short.time
      ‘The youth cried for a long time / a short time.’     Additional properties of temporal extent adverbs are conveyed by selected con-
structions. As with other extent adjuncts, temporal extent restricts polarity and
mood. It fails in imperatives, prohibitives, polar questions and negative statements
(*ólí ómòhè í ì mùzán títítí [the man SC NEG wait long.time] ‘The man did not wait for
a long time’).
     Temporal extent adverbs reject functions of aspectualizer preverbs ya (*ólí
ómóhé yà múzán títítí [the man PAP.PA wait long.time] ‘The man used to wait for a
long time’) and mo (*ólí ómóhé mó' múzán títítí [the man PAP.PA wait long.time]
‘The man at one time waited for a long time’).
     Discourse repositioning of temporal extent adverbs is disallowed. They do not
occupy topic or focus position.(73) a. *tìtìtì,     ólí ómóhé múzán'-ì.
         long.time the man PAP.wait-F

         long.time PF the man PAP.wait-F
         ‘It was a long time that the man waited.’    A distinct temporal extent adverb is kékéké ‘continuously.’ It tends to occur with
activity verbs, e.g. vie ‘cry.’ With dual sense stative verbs like muzan (‘stand’ or
‘wait’), kékéké combines only with its posture sense.(74) òjè múzán-í kékéké.
     Oje PRP.stand continuously
     ‘Oje stood / * waited continuously.’kékéké is limited to clauses inflected for Past or Present perfect. It fails to appear in
either imperfect or prospective aspect.(75) a. ólí óvbékhán víé-í'       kékéké.

kékéké fails to appear in imperatives, prohibitives, negative statements or polar
questions (*ólí óvbékhán víé-í' kékéké? [the youth PAP.cry-F continuously] ‘Did the
youth cry continuously?’).
    kékéké disallows any functions associated with preverbs ya (*ólí óvbékhán yà víé
kékéké [the youth PAP.PA cry continuously] ‘The youth used to cry continuously’)
and mo (*ólí óvbékhán mó' víé kékéké [the youth PAP.PA cry continuously] ‘The
youth at one time cried continuously’).
    Likewise, discourse repositioning of kékéké is disallowed. kékéké fails to occupy
focus or topic position.(77) *kékéké        lí ólí óvbékhán víé'-ì.
      continuously PF the youth       PAP.cry-F
      ‘It was continuously that the youth cried.’6.1.7 Temporal rate adverbsAdverbs specifying event rate do not correspond to any direct question frame. Many
exemplars of this class show morphological reduplication or triplication. They serve
as adverbs by virtue of their syntactic position and inducement of high tone spread
in a preceding constituent.
     A typical temporal rate adverb is tóítóí ‘quickly.’ It severely restricts aspect, po-
larity, mood and discourse respositioning. tóítóí occurs only in statements marked
by the Hortative auxiliary. It rejects clauses inflected for perfect, imperfect or pro-
spective aspect.(78) ólí ómòhè í     vàré tóítóí.
     the man HOR come quickly
     ‘The man should come quickly.’
                                                  Overview of temporal adverbials | 319Temporal tóítóí has no corresponding direct question, such as ébé'/ébí' …i ‘how.’(79) ébé' ólí ómóhé í'          vàré?
     how the man PAP.MAN come

     *ó í'    vàré tóítóí.       /    *tóítóí.
      he HOR come quickly              quickly
      ‘He should come quickly.’        ‘Quickly.’    Concerning polarity and mood, temporal rate tóítóí appears in imperative con-
structions (vàré tóítóí [come quickly] ‘Come quickly’) but not prohibitives, negative
statements, or polar questions.
    Discourse repositioning of tóítóí is severely restricted. It fails in focus or topic
position.(80) *tóítóí lí ólí ómóhé í'              vàré.
      quickly PF the man PAP.HOR come
      ‘It is quickly that the man should come.’     Another temporal rate adverb is èjéèjè ‘quickly.’4 It also manifests a highly re-
stricted syntactic distribution. èjéèjè is limited to canonical declarative clauses in-
flected for imperfect aspect. It fails in perfect or prospective aspect clauses.(81) ólì òkpòsò ò ó wèlò ótóí        á èjéèjè.
     the woman SC C sweep ground CS quickly
     ‘The woman is sweeping up the ground quickly.’As with other temporal rate adverbs, èjéèjè has no direct question counterpart, not
even manner ébé'/ébí' …i ‘how.’(82) ébé' ólí ókpósó ó ò í       wèlò ótóí     á?
     how the woman SC H MAN sweep ground CS

      quickly           she C sweep ground CS quickly
      ‘Quickly.’        ‘She is sweeping up the ground quickly.’    Relative to polarity and mood, èjéèjè appears in imperative constructions (wèlò
òtòì á èjéèjè [sweep ground CS quickly] ‘Sweep up the ground quickly’). It fails in
prohibitives, negative statements and polar questions.
320 | Adverbial adjuncts    Discourse repositioning of èjéèjé is limited. It occurs as topic when modified by
demonstrative na. The accompanying matrix clause requires perfect aspect. With
similar propositional content, èjéèjé fails in li/ni marked focus position.5(83) a. èjéèjé nà, ólí ókpósó wéló'           òtòì      á.

plete or partial. Most extent adverbs are severely restricted relative to their verbs.
They occur with only a single verb or a small subset of verbs with like semantic
properties. Aspectual extent forms correspond to direct question frames with
ébé'/ébí'…i…se. A few selected adverbs suggest the character of this subclass: sésésé
‘completely, neatly,’ jáún ‘completely,’ gbègbéí ‘completely’ and ghéghéghé ‘com-
pletely to the brim.’
    Aspectual extent adverb sésésé occurs with simple predicates (e.g. fuan ‘be
clean’).(84) ólí ékóà fúán-í            sésésé.
     the room PRP.be.clean-F completely
     ‘The room is absolutely clean.’sésésé also occurs with complex predicates (e.g. welo a ‘sweep up’) in clauses in-
flected for Present or Past perfect as well as prospective Predictive. It rejects pro-
spective Anticipative aspect and imperfect aspect.(85) a. ólí ókpósó wéló'      òtòì     á sésésé.

     ‘It is absolutely clean.’                ‘Completely.’     Additional properties of aspectual extent adverbs like sésésé arise in selected
constructions. While not appearing in prohibitives, polar questions or negative
statements, sésésé is found in imperatives (wèlò òtòì á sésésé [sweep ground CS
completely] ‘Sweep up the ground neatly / completely’). sésésé type extent adverbs
fail with aspectualizer preverbs ya (*ólí ókpósó yà wéló òtòì á sésésé [the woman
PAP.PA sweep ground CS neatly] ‘The woman used to sweep the ground up neatly /
completely’) and mo (*ólí ókpósó mó' wéló òtòì á sésésé [the woman PAP.PA sweep
ground CS neatly] ‘The woman at one time swept the ground up neatly’).
     Discourse repositioning of aspectual extent adverbs is severely restricted. Forms
like sésésé never occur in focus or topic position.(87) a. *sésésé lí ólí ókpósó wéló'          òtòì    á.

         ‘As for completely, the woman swept the ground up that way.’     The aspectual extent adverb jáún co-occurs with the complex predicate too a
‘burn up.’ Its clause inflects for Present and Past perfect as well as prospective Pre-
dictive. It rejects prospective Anticipative and imperfect aspect.(88) a. ólí ógó tóó'         á jáún.

322 | Adverbial adjunctsLike other aspectual extent adverbs, jáún corresponds to question frame
ébé'/ébí'…i…se. In response, jáún occurs in situ, not in a simple adverb phrase.(89) ébé' ólí ógó í'           tòò sé?
     how the bush PAP.MAN burn extent

     it PAP.burn CS completely            completely
     ‘It burned up completely.’           ‘Completely.’    Additional properties of jáún are highlighted by several selected constructions.
jáún fails to occur in imperatives, prohibitives, polar questions or negative state-
ments, as ungrammatical polar questions suggest (*ólì ògò tóó á jáún? [the bush
PRP.burn CS completely] ‘Did the bush burn up completely?’).
    Discourse repositioning of aspectual extent jáún is also constrained. It fails to
occupy focus or topic position.(90) *jáún       lí ólí ógó tóó'         à.

as forms gbèìgbéí or gbéí. Aspectual extent gbègbéí clauses inflect for perfect aspect,
rejecting prospective and imperfect aspect.(91) a. ójé vbóó'       ólí óókhó gbéí.

Like other aspectual extent adverbs, gbègbéí does not appear in imperative or pro-
hibitive constructions. However, it is found in negative statements (ólí ómòhè í ì è ólí
émáé gbègbéí [the man SC NEG eat the food completely] ‘The man did not eat the
food at all’) and polar questions (ójé ánmé' óí étò á gbègbéí? [Oje PAP.scrape her hair
CS completely] ‘Did Oje scrape off her hair completely?’).
    Discourse repositioning of gbègbéí is unacceptable. Even under perfect nega-
tion, gbègbéí does not occupy focus position or topic position.(93) *gbègbéí    lí ójé ánmé'          óí étò á.
      completely PF Oje PAP.scrape her hair CS
      ‘It was completely that Oje scraped off her hair.’    Slightly more restricted is aspectual extent adverb ghéghéghé, which combines
with a predicate such as voon ‘fill.’ ghéghéghé occurs only in clauses inflected for
Past perfect. It rejects Present perfect, imperfect aspect and prospective aspect.(94) ólí émá vóón'      ìtásá     ghéghéghé.
     the yam PAP.fill plate to.the.brim / completely
     ‘The yam filled the plate to the brim.’ghéghéghé corresponds to the question frame ébé'/ébí'…i…se. Responses require

     it fill-F to.the.brim              to.the.brim
     ‘It filled to the brim.’           ‘To the brim.’     Further properties of ghéghéghé follow from selected constructions. It restricts
mood and polarity. ghéghéghé fails in imperatives, prohibitives, negatives and polar
questions, as unacceptable polar questions indicate (*ólí émá vóón' ìtásá
ghéghéghé? [the yam PAP.fill plate to.the.brim] ‘Did the yam fill the plate to the

     ghéghéghé does not license any functions associated with aspectualizer pre-
verbs ya (*ólí émà yà vóón ólì ìtásá ghéghéghé [the yam PRP.IG fill the plate
to.the.brim] ‘The yam almost filled the plate to the brim’) and mo (*ólí émà móò

324 | Adverbial adjuncts     Likewise, ghéghéghé allows no repositioning in discourse. It fails to appear in
li/ni focus position or in topic position.(96) *ghéghéghé lí ólí émá vóón'           ìtásà.
      to.the.brim PF the yam PAP.fill plate
      ‘It was to the brim that the yam filled the plate.’6.2 Place adverbials
Adjunct adverbials of place are headed by preposition vbi. Their interrogative frame
requires verb in series za ‘be located,’ although za does not appear in corresponding
declaratives. Place adjuncts show direct question frame ébé'/ébí'…za ‘where.’ vbi
adjunct questions thus differ from vbi argument questions, which disallow za.
    vbi phrases of place serving as adjuncts occur with verbs like gbe ‘kill’ that do
not subcategorize for a locative argument.6(97) ólí ómòhè gbé        ólí ófé vbí ímè.
     the man PRP.kill the rat LOC farm
     ‘The man has killed the rat on the farm.’Place adjuncts with vbi do not restrict aspect. They occur in clauses inflected for
perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.(98) a. ólí ómòhè gbé         ólí ófé vbí ímè.

sponses show the place nominal in focus position, as a simple adverb but not in situ.(99) ébé' ólí ómóhé zá'               gbé ófè?

     ‘It was at the farm that he killed it.’        ‘At the farm.’     Place adjuncts reveal additional properties. They occur in imperatives (è ólí
émáé vbí ímè [eat the food LOC farm] ‘Eat the food on the farm’), prohibitives (é è é
émáé vbí ímè [you PR eat food LOC farm] ‘Don't eat the food on the farm’) and nega-
tive statements (ólí ómòhè í ì gbè ólí ófé vbí ímè [the man SC NEG kill the rat LOC
farm] ‘The man did not kill the rat on the farm’), as well as polar questions (ólí
ómóhé gbé' ólí ófé vbí ímè? [the man PAP.kill the rat LOC farm] ‘Did the man kill the
rat on the farm?’).
     Adjuncts of place appear with preverb ya in its functions Past Absolute (ólí
ómóhé yà gbé ófé vbí ímè [the man PAP.PA kill rat LOC farm] ‘The man used to kill
rats on the farm’) and Ingressive (ólí ómòhè yà gbé ólí ófé vbí ímè [the man PRP.IG
kill the rat LOC farm] ‘The man almost killed the rat on the farm’). With aspectualiz-
er mo, only Past Absolute is allowed (ólí ómóhé mó' gbé ófé vbí ímè [the man PAP.PA
kill rat LOC farm] ‘The man at one time killed rats on the farm’).
     Discourse repositioning of place adjuncts is not restricted. They appear in focus
or topic position, although corresponding constructions are differentially marked.
Focus constructions require za in the matrix clause and disallow preposition vbi. In
contrast, topic constructions require nondeictic locative anaphor o as complement
of vbi; they disallow za.7(100) a. ímè lí ólí ómóhé zá'              gbé ófè.

         ‘As for the farm, the man killed a rat on it.’6.3 Manner adverbs
Manner adverbs consist of at least four subclasses. They restrict aspect, deontic
modality, polarity and mood, and appear in focus and topic position. Each manner
adverb corresponds to direct question ébé'/ ébí' …i ‘how.’
326 | Adverbial adjuncts      One manner subclass is found with verb shan ‘walk.’ Members such as dàbìdábí
‘staggeringly’ express manner variations relative to a basic walking event. Other
adverbs that occur with shan ‘walk’ include: húú, húlóhúló ‘clumsily, very clumsily,’
nwéínwéí ‘stealthily,’ nyágán ‘awkwardly, crab-like,’ nyàkhúánnyàkhúán ‘waddling-
ly,’ súné, súnésúné ‘clumsily, very clumsily,’ and váí, váíváí ‘briskly, very briskly.’8(101) ólí ómòhè ò ó shán dàbìdábí.
      the man SC C walk staggeringly
      ‘The man is walking in a staggeringly fashion / is staggering.’Although manner adverbs of this first subclass tend to occur clause finally, they can
appear after shan ‘walk’ when it is in series with shan ‘proceed to.’(102) a. òjè ò ó shán dàbìdábí           shàn    vbí èkìn.
         Oje SC C walk staggeringly proceed LOC market
         ‘Oje is staggering to / walking staggeringly to the market.’
      b. òjè ò ó shán nwéínwéí shàn            vbí èkìn.
         Oje SC C walk stealthily proceed LOC market
         ‘Oje is walking stealthily to the market.’Manner adverbs that co-occur with shan appear only in clauses inflected for Contin-
uous or Habitual imperfect. They reject perfect and prospective aspect.(103) ólí ómòhè ò ó shàn súnésúné           / váíváí        / nyágán.
      the man SC C walk very.clumsily very.briskly awkwardly
      ‘The man is walking very clumsily / very briskly / awkwardly.’Manner adjuncts with shan correspond to direct question ébé'/ébí'...i. In response,
manner adverbs appear in situ, not as a simple adverb phrase or in focus position.(104) ébé' ó ò í        shán?
      how he H MAN walk
      ‘How does he walk?’
      ó ò shán nyàkhùánnyàkhùán.           /      *nyàkhùánnyàkhùán.
      he H walk waddlingly                         waddlingly
      ‘He walks in a waddle-like fashion.’         ‘In a waddle-like fashion.’     Manner adverbs with shan restrict polarity and mood. They are not found in im-
peratives, prohibitives, negative statements or polar questions, as a polar question
with nyágán suggests (*ólí ómòhè ò ó shàn nyágán? [the man SC C walk awkwardly]
‘Is the man walking awkwardly?’).
                                                                Manner adverbs | 327   Likewise, manner adverbs associated with shan limit discourse repositioning.
They fail to occupy focus or topic position.(105) *nyágán      lí ólí ómóhé ó ò shán.
       awkwardly PF the man SC H walk
       ‘It is awkwardly that the man walks.’    A second subclass of manner adverb co-occurs with transitive verbs of con-
sumption. Members include: tùzètúzé ‘wretchedly,’ kóíkóí ‘briskly, fast paced,’ sú-
nésúné ‘clumsily,’9 and záízáí ‘hurriedly.’ Manner adverbs of this subclass appear
only in clauses inflected for imperfect Continuous or Habitual. They reject perfect
and prospective aspect.(106) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émáé kóíkóí.
         the man SC C eat the food gulpingly
         ‘The man is gulping / eating the food in a gulping fashion.’
      b. ólí ómòhè ó ó è ólí émáé súnésúné.
         the man SC C eat the food clumsily
         ‘The man is eating the food in a clumsy fashion.’Manner adverbs of consumption correspond to direct question ébé'/ébí'...i ‘how.’
Responses show the manner adverb in situ, not in a simple adverb phrase or in focus
position.(107) ébé' ólí ómóhé ó ò í         è émàè?
      how the man SC H MAN eat food
      ‘How does the man eat food?’

      he H eat it briskly                briskly
      ‘He eats it briskly.’              ‘In a brisk fashion.’    Relative to polarity and mood, manner adverbs of consumption appear in im-
perative constructions (è ólí émáé kóíkóí [eat the food briskly] ‘Eat the food in a brisk
fashion’). They they fail in prohibitives, negative statements and polar questions.
    Manner adverbs of consumption restrict discourse repositioning. They do not
occur in focus position or topic position.(108) *kóíkóí, ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàè.
       briskly the man SC C eat the food
       ‘Briskly, the man is eating food.’
328 | Adverbial adjuncts    A manner adverb with a distinct collocational range and derivational history is
ghéghéghé ‘precariously.’ Prototypically, it occurs with simple and complex predi-
cates that convey hanging events. ghéghéghé appears phonologically and semanti-
cally related to the verb gheghe ‘position precariously.’ However, there is no syn-
chronic verb ghe with the same or a related meaning.(109) a. ò ghéghé                       ólì àgá ó vbí ókhúnmí ìtébù.

in imperatives (nwù ólì èkpà khúán ghéghéghé [take the bag suspend precariously]
‘Hang the bag precariously’). It does not occur in prohibitives, polar questions or
negative statements.
    Discourse repositioning of ghéghéghé is restricted. It fails to occupy focus or top-

tal ìyó ‘that way’ (DMD) and proximal ìná ‘this way’ (PMD).10 In addition to the deic-
tic character of each, ìyó displays an anaphoric function, where it co-refers to an
event in preceding discourse.(113) ólí ómóhé dín'      ólí éwé ìyó / ìná.

position, provided the Manner preverb i occurs in the matrix clause. ìyó never as-
sumes topic position, regardless of manner i's presence.(116) a. ìyó lí ólí ómóhé í'             dín ólí éwè.

332 | Adverbial adjuncts6.4 Simile adjunct
The preposition bí ‘like’ (also élàbí) and its following noun phrase appear clause
finally, immediately after the verb phrase, where they serve a simile function.11 Alt-
hough bí phrases bear on interpretation of subject referent rather than clause event,
they obligatorily appear in clause final position. Unlike adverbials, bí phrases fail to
induce high tone spread in a preceding constituent. Nonetheless, they correspond to
the manner question frame ébé'/ébí' …i ‘how.’(123) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàè, bí éwè.
         the man SC C eat the food like goat
         ‘The man is eating the food like a goat.’
      b. ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó lá, bí òhí.

         the youth      SC C become.heavy like iron
         ‘The youth is getting heavy like iron.’    Simile bí phrases restrict aspect, polarity, mood and repositioning of their com-
plements. With transitive activity verbs, bí phrases require a clause inflected for
imperfect aspect; they reject perfect and prospective aspect.(124) a. ólí óvbékhán ó ò è émàè, bí òhí.
         the youth      SC H eat food like Ohi
         ‘The youth eats food like Ohi.’

émàè, bí òhí [the youth SC H eat food like Ohi] ‘Does the youth eat food like Ohi?’).
    Discourse respositioning of bí phrases is unacceptable. They fail in topic or fo-
cus position.(126) *bí òhí lí ólí óvbékhán ó ò è émàè.

       ‘It is like Ohi that the youth eats.’6.5 Reason adverbials
Adverbial phrases expressing reason or cause are headed by the nominal òhíó ‘be-
cause’ followed by Associative ísì and its complement. òhíó phrases are strictly or-
dered relative to their matrix clause. Reason adverbials appear clause initially, ei-
ther in focus position, verb re ‘take/use’ being obligatory in the matrix clause, or in
topic position, in which case re does not occur.(127) a. òhíó ísì òjè lí ólí ómóhé ré'             é ólí émàè léé.

         cause ASS Oje the man PAP.eat the food TEMP
         ‘Because of Oje, the man finished eating the food.’Reason adverbial phrases never occur in clause final position (*ólí ómóhé é' òlí émàè
léé òhíó ísì òjè [the man PAP.eat the food TEMP because ASS Oje] ‘The man finished
eating the food because of Oje’). In declarative clauses, they appear as noun phrase
complements of verb re ‘take.’(128) ólí ómóhé ré'         òhíó ísì òjè gbé ófè.
      the man PAP.take cause ASS Oje kill rat
      ‘The man killed rats because of Oje.’    Reason adverbials in topic position show matrix clauses exhibiting co-
occurrence restrictions relative to polarity, and mood but not aspect. Their matrix
clauses inflect for perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.

direct question frame émé' ó ze khi ‘why.’ Responses show the complement of ísì in
focus position without òhíó or in simple òhíó headed associative phrases. Responses
to reason adverbials do not include in situ òhíó phrases as complement of re.(130) émé' ó zé-í'          khí ólí ómóhé é'            ólí émàè léé?

and prohibitives (é è ré òhíó ísì òkpòsò gbé égbé é [you PR take cause ASS woman kill

atives, where òhíó phrases occur as topic (òhíó ísì òjè, ólí ómòhè í ì è ólí émàè [cause

òjè lí ólí ómóhé ré' é ólí émàè léé? [cause ASS Oje PF the man PAP.take eat the food
TEMP] ‘Was it because of Oje the man finished eating the food?’).
     A related adverbial expresses benefactive justification or reason. It exhibits a
phrasal character. Its head, èrímí' ‘on behalf of,’ takes a noun phrase with no inter-
vening ísì and is limited to first person mè. It rejects second or third person pro-
nouns and lexical nouns, all of which require Associative ísì (*èrímí' ísì òjè lí áléké
ré' yé òkè [behalf ASS Oje PF Aleke PAP.take move.to Oke] ‘It was on behalf of Oje
that Aleke went to Oke).(131) èrímí' mè lí ójé ré'          yé       òkè.
      behalf me PF Oje PAP.take move.to Oke
      ‘It was on my behalf that Oje went to Oke.’Benefactive phrases with èrímí' occupy li/ni marked focus position, where re ‘take’
in the matrix clause is obligatory. Benefactive èrímí' shuns topic position.(132) èrímí' mè lí ójé ré'          yé       òkè.
      behalf me PF Oje PAP.take move.to Oke
      ‘It was on my behalf that Oje went to Oke.’Additionally, benefactive èrímí' phrases never occur as complement of re in declara-
tive structures (*ólí ómóhé ré' èrímí' mè yé òkè [the man PAP.take behalf me move.to
Oke] ‘The man on my behalf went to Oke’).
     Relative to interrogative structures, èrímí' phrases do not correspond to direct
question frame émé' ó ze khi or any other direct question.(133) émé' ó zé-í'           khí ólí ómóhé gbé' ólí óì?

peratives, prohibitives and polar interrogatives, regardless of re occurrence. Howev-
er, erímí' adverbials in topic position co-occur with perfect negation (èrímí' mè, ólí

"8.1.5.2 Partitive ri / e
A Partitive (PAR) function distinct from EXT and LCT is expressed by predicates ri
and e: NP ri vbi o and NP e vbi o. Its construction consists of an initial noun phrase,
either of the verbs ri or e, and a vbi complement consisting of the nondeictic locative
pronoun. PAR asserts a partitive relation between a subject referent and an assumed
456 | Be, do, happen and haveplurality indexed by nondeictic locative pronoun ò. Canonical PAR constructions
restrict their grammatical shape in the fashion of Existential constructions.
     PAR constructions exhibit few properties normally associated with verbs. ri in-
flects for aspect with an irregular tone pattern and fails to allow auxiliaries and
preverbs. Regarding aspect, PAR ri permits Present perfect (right edge low tone
subject and a high low verb tone). In typical verb phrases, high low tone occurs on
auxiliaries and preverbs, not verbs. Morever, PAR ri fails to inflect for imperfect or
prospective aspect.(83) ólí ómòhè ríì     vbì ò.
     the man PRP.be LOC them
     ‘The man is among them.’PAR e constructions never show aspect in the affirmative. They fail to inflect for
perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(84) a. *ólí ómóhé ló      è vbì ò.
         the man PRED be LOC them
         ‘The man will be among them.’
     b. *ólí ómóhé ó ò è vbì ò.
         the man SC H be LOC them
         ‘The man was among them.’     PAR constructions, regardless of ri or e as predicate, do not accept any auxilia-
ries or preverbs, as suggested by unacceptable epistemic Certaintive ma, relative
tense kpe, aspectualizer preverb Repetitive che and evaluative preverb kuku, among
others (*ólí ómóhé má' / kpé' / ché' / kú'kù rì vbì ò [the man PAP.CER SUB REP EVAL
be LOC them] ‘The man surely / yet / again / after all was among them’).
     In PAR constructions polarity and mood are limited. ri constructions occur as
polar interrogatives (ólí ómòhè ríì vbì ò? [the man PRP.be LOC them] ‘Is the man
among them?’) but never as negatives (*ólí ómòhè í ì rì vbì ò [the man SC NEG be LOC
them] ‘The man was not among them’) or as imperatives or prohibitives.
     PAR e constructions require Perfect Negation. In addition, they appear as polar
interrogatives but never as imperatives or prohibitives.(85) a. ómòhè í ì       è vbì ò.
        male SC NEG be LOC them

     he we PRP.be LOC them
     ‘He is / We are among them.’PAR subject position limits NP type but not animacy and syntactic shape. PAR sub-

áwà, inanimate ìtébù) or definiteness marking.(88) a. ómòhè / ólí ómòhè ríì          vbì ò.

        table    the table PRP.be LOC them
        ‘A table / The table is among them.’     PAR accepts some postdeterminers in subject position. One finds deictic
demonstratives nà and áìn (ólí ómóhé nà / áìn ríì vbì ò [the man this that PRP.be LOC
them] ‘This / That man is among them’), cardinal numerals, e.g. èvá (ímòhè èvá rì vbì
ò [men two PAP.be LOC them] ‘Two men are among them’), partitive existential
quantifier ósò (ómóhé ósò ríì vbì ò [man certain PRP.be LOC them] ‘A certain man is
among them’) and deictic kindred élìyó (ékpá élìyó rì vbì ò [bag that.kind PAP.be
LOC them] ‘A bag of that kind is among them’). However, PAR subject disallows
contrastive demonstrative (nóì), contrastive existential (óvbèé), contrastive kindred
(ódàn) in addition to collective numerals (e.g. èvèvá) and universal quantifiers
(èrèmé, òdóòdè).
     PAR subject permits nonlexical postdeterminers. Allowed are associative ísì
(ékpá ísì òhí rì vbì ò [bag ASS Ohi PAP.be LOC them] ‘Ohi’s bag is among them’),
attributive li (ékpá lí óbín' rì vbì ò [bag R dark PAP.be LOC them] ‘A dark bag is
among them’), and relative clause (ékpá lí ólí ónwímé dé'-ì ríì vbì ò [bag R the farmer
PAP.buy-F PRP.be LOC them] ‘A bag that the farmer bought is among them’).
458 | Be, do, happen and have     PAR subject position partially restricts impersonal pronouns.16 It allows pro-
nouns for deictic demonstrative ònà and óáìn (ònà / óáìn ríì vbì ò [this.one that.one
PRP.be LOC them] ‘This / that one is among them’), cardinal numerals, e.g. èvá (èvá
rì vbì ò [two PAP.be LOC them] ‘Two are among them’), partitive existential quantifi-
er ósò (ósò ríì vbì ò [certain.one PRP.be LOC them] ‘A certain one is among them’)
and deictic kindred élìyó (élìyó rì vbì ò [that.kind.one PAP.be LOC them] ‘That kind is
among them’). PAR subject disallows contrastive kindred (ódàn), contrastive exis-
tential (óvbèé), universal quantifier (èrèmé, òdóòdé) and collective numerals (e.g.
èvèvá).
     Noun phrase positions in PAR constructions respond asymmetrically to reposi-
tioning in discourse. ri and e constructions behave dissimilarly as well. With ri, PAR
subject corresponds to a constituent designated as positive focus li/ni, negative
focus ki, or topic. PAR subject fails to correspond to an interrogative pronoun. In e
constructions, PAR subject never corresponds to a constituent in focus, topic or
question word position. Similarly restricted are vbi complements, which fail to cor-
respond to any discourse position: focus, topic or question word.(89) a. ògbòbè        òkpá lí ó rì        vbì ò.

tinctive properties. Verb phrase properties pertain to polarity and mood, verb suffix-
es, inflection, auxiliary categories, preverb categories and postverbal particles.

ence to discourse defined positions. This same u form, in collocation with particular
nouns, also expresses a range of meanings translated as ‘act, behave, execute,
achieve, perform’ (Chapter 8, 8.4).","[481, 482, 483, 484, 485]"

    ‘Oje has pretended to sleep.’              ‘Oje is pretending to laugh.’Aspectual properties of means predications reflect in part those of the accompanying verb. For
instance the verbs mehen and je in series do not uniformly accept Continuous inflection; only je
takes this aspect.(ii) *òjè ò ó rè íká             mèhén.        òjè ò ó rè íká            jé.

      ‘Oje is pretending to sleep.’            ‘Oje is pretending to laugh.’Absent re in series, only je admits the Continuous.(iii) *òjè ò ó mèhén.                          òjè ò ó jé.

      ‘Oje is sleeping.’                       ‘Oje is laughing.’Means re predications that assume an imperative form reveal a similar contributory role for activity
verbs. The verb je ‘laugh’ requires the Ingressive preverb ya in imperatives as does its corresponding
re predication. The reverse is true for mehen.(iv) mèhèn.                                    yà jé.

Emai exhibits lexical items that reflect contact with various ethnic groups and their
languages in the relatively recent past. As well, some of these lexemes might reflect
a common historical past. For the moment, we do not pursue this historical matter.
Borrowed lexemes derive from English, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo, among other lan-
guages. Most borrowed forms are nouns for concrete or highly abstract objects.
Verbs tend not to be borrowed.
    Lexemes that appear borrowed from English denote artifacts, food, locations
and abstractions. Many refer to referents from an English colonial era that persisted
from the 1890s to the 1960s.","[112, 113]"

NP type, animacy and syntactic shape. It requires a third person accusative pro-
noun, accepting singular (óì) or plural (íyàìn) forms. It never allows first or second
person accusative pronouns. Moreover, it fails to admit proper names or bare com-
mon nouns of any animacy value (*ò ú ójé / áwà / óvbèkhàn [he PRP.do Oje dog
youth] ‘He did Oje / a dog / a youth’).(95) ò ú           óì / íyàìn / *mè / *é.
     he PRP.do it them me / you
     ‘He did it / them.’Direct objects for monotransitive u also restrict syntactically elaborated common
nouns. They reject human nouns (ómò) modified by definite article ólí/élí (*ò ú ólí
ómò [he PRP.do the infant] ‘He did the infant’) or postdeterminers such as áìn or ósò
(*ò ú ólí ómò áìn [he PRP.do the infant that] ‘He did that infant’, *ò ú ómó ósò [he
PRP.do infant certain] ‘He did some infant’).
    However, u direct object accepts impersonal pronouns. It shows demonstrative
óáìn, ònà and ónóì (ò ú óáìn / ònà / ónóì [he PRP.do that.one this.one next.one] ‘He
did that one / this one / the next one’), universal quantifier èrèmé (ò ú èrèmé [he

one’), and numerals, e.g. cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá (ò ú èvá / èvèvá [he
PRP.do two both] ‘He did all / two / both’). Unacceptable are kindred pronouns.
    Noun phrase positions framed by monotransitive u differentially correspond to
discourse defined positions. Subjects correspond to li/ni focus or topic constituents
(àlèkè). Direct objects never correspond to these constituents.(96) a. àlèkè lí ó ú'              óì.

Subject corresponds to question word óé' ‘who’ but never émé' ‘what.’ Direct object
corresponds to interrogative pronouns émé' and ékà but not óé'.(97) a. óé' / *émé' ó ú'    óì?

verb za in series (Chapter 6, 6.2). Similarly, queries about manner adjuncts with u
require ébé' and manner preverb i/e (Chapter 6, 6.3).(99) a. ébé' ólí ókpósó zá'                ú óì?

        DMD PF she PAP.MAN do it
        ‘It was that way that she did it.’     Monotransitive u constructions are relatively unconstrained as to polarity and
mood. They appear as imperatives (ù óì [do it] ‘Do it’), prohibitives (é è ú óì [you PR

PRP.do it] ‘Did the woman do it?’).
     u construction predicates manifest many properties typically associated with
verbs. Although they restrict verbal affixes, they do not limit verb inflection, auxilia-
ries, preverbs, postverbal particles and temporal adjuncts. Regarding verbal affixes,
monotransitive u rejects Perseverative prefix Ci- and Distributive suffix -lo/lo/no, as
in *élí ímòhè ú-ló óì [the men PRP.do-DS it] ‘Each of the men did it.’ Under bare verb
phrase conditions, however, u accepts Factative suffix -ì, as when direct object posi-
tion is vacated in information questions (émé' ólí ómóhé ú'-ì? [what the man PAP.do-
F] ‘What did the man do?’).
     Monotransitive u inflection reveals perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.(100) a. ólí óvbèkhàn ú           óì. /   ólí óvbékhán ú'       óì.

judgment types rational DED za (ólí ómòhè záà ú óì [the man PRP.DED do it] ‘The

      Monotransitive u also permits relative tense, although Anterior ke requires a po-
lar interrogative (ólí ómòhè kéè ú óì? [the man PRP.ANT do it] ‘Did the man do it
464 | Be, do, happen and haveafterward / anymore?’), while Subsequent kpe does not (ólí ómóhé kpé' ú óì [the man
PAP.SUB do it] ‘The man still did it / did it despite pending conditions’).
     In monotransitive u constructions, preverbs are partially limited. Although
manner-demonstrative ìyó and ìná are disallowed, u ‘do’ accepts phasal aspectual-
izers: Repetitive che (ólí ómòhè chéè ú óì [the man PRP.REP do it] ‘The man did it

     Monotransitive u also permits boundary aspectualizers: Conative òó (ólí ómòhè
ó ó' ù óì [he man SC CON do it] ‘The man went to do it’), Egressive mo, requiring the
Temporal Perspective particle (ólí ómòhè móò ú óì léé [he man PRP.EG do it TEMP]
‘The man almost finished doing it’), Ingressive ya (ólí ómòhè yà ú óì [the man PRP.IG

ú óì [he man PAP.PAB do it] ‘The man used to do it’) and Past Absolute mo (ólí
ómóhé mó' ú óì [he man PAP.PAB do it] ‘The man at one time did it’).
     Monotransitive u allows most evaluative preverbs with the exception of woo ‘in-
stead.’ u constructions are found with duu (ólí ómóhé dú'ú ú óì [the man PAP.EVAL
do it] ‘The man for no reason did it’) and kuku (ólí ómòhè kúkù / *wóò ú óì [the man
PRP.POEV PREV do it] ‘The man afterall did it’).
     Not limited in monotransitive u constructions are temporal preverbs: kpao (ólí
ómòhè kpáò ú óì [the man earlier PRP.do it] ‘The man initially did it’), gue (ólí ómòhè
gúé ú óì [the man PRP.unexpectedly do it] ‘The man did it quicker than expected’),
bobo (ólí ómóhé bó'bò ú óì [the man PAP.promptly do it] ‘The man promptly did it’)
and tua (ólí ómòhè túá ú óì [the man PRP.hurriedly do it] ‘The man hurriedly did it’).
     Monotransitive u restricts a few subject attributive preverbs. Ungrammatical are
dábo ‘deliberately’ and totóbo ‘intensely.’ Grammatical are dóbo (ólí ómóhé dó'bò ú
óì [the man PAP.mistakenly do it] ‘The man mistakenly did it’), miti (ólí ómóhé mí'tì

and dégbe (ólí ómòhè ò ó dègbé ù óì [the man SC C carefully do it] ‘The man is steadi-
ly doing it’).
     Unrestricted in monotransitive u constructions are quantity preverbs. One finds
the forms dobo (ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì ú óì [the man PAP.REFL him do it] ‘The man did it
himself’) and gba (élí ímóhé gbá' ú óì [the men PAP.COL do it] ‘The men did it to-
gether’). Intensifier quantity forms also occur, although each requires a detransitiv-
ized predicate phrase with partitive vbi: zemi (ólí ómòhè zémì ú vbì ò [the man
PRP.ABSI do LOC it] ‘The man did a lot of it’) and zeze (ólí ómòhè zézè ú vbì ò [the

"6.6 Ideophonic adverbs
Ideophonic adverbs articulate meanings that reflect speaker perspective. They need
not express a meaning shared by speaker and hearer and as such are not open to
interrogation by a hearer. Like other adverbs, they occupy postverbal position and
induce high tone spread in an immediately preceding noun phrase constituent.
     Ideophonic adverbs assume a variety of morphological shapes and often ex-
press meanings typically lexicalized in English verbs. Some exhibit reduplication or
triplication.gbírígbírí ‘jerkily’                      dúdúdú    ‘very dark’

While they seem closely related to clause assertion, ideophonic adverbs do not fall
within the scope of assertion as judged by émé'…u ‘what happen,’ émé'…ruan ‘what
happen,’ and émé'…u ‘what do’ questions. Responses to these question types that
include an ideophonic adverb (e.g. pèú, gábé, bóbóbó) are unacceptable.(135) émé' ójé ú'-ì?

      ‘Oje ran.’                          ‘Oje scampered off.’     Some ideophonic adverbs appear to heighten an event’s intensity level vis-à-vis
its predicate. The verb si, for instance, has the sense ‘draw, pull,’ whereas the collo-
cation of si and the ideophonic adverb gúómí ‘with a jerk’ conveys a meaning equiv-
alent to the English verb ‘jerk, cause a sudden jerky movement.’ Likewise, the collo-
cation of verb khaan ‘pound’ and ideophone gùán ‘with a poke’ specifies English
verb ‘poke.’ khaan alone does not express ‘poke’; instead, it conveys ‘pound.’(138) a. ólì àgbèdé      sí'         óí vbí éán gúómí.

         he PRP.pound it move.against them LOC mouth
         ‘He pounded it against their mouth.’With similar effect, other ideophonic adverbs (e.g. kútúkútú, tòbótòbó, yéyéyé) ex-
press meanings encapsulated by the English verbs ‘seethe,’ ‘glitter’ and ‘quiver.’

A subclass of postverbal adverbs consists of forms whose base morpheme corre-
sponds to a synchronic verb. Deverbalized adverbs exhibit severe syntactic limita-
tions. Among these forms are reduplicated rùrùrúrú and bìbìbíbí. Each corresponds,
respectively, to extant verbs ruru ‘be foolish’ and bibi ‘move in zigzag fashion.’(143) a. òjè ò ó tà       étá    rùrùrúrú. /   ójé ó ò rùrú.
         Oje SC C speak words foolishly        Oje SC H be.foolish
         ‘Oje is speaking foolishly.’          ‘Oje is foolish.’
      b. òjè ò ó lá bìbìbíbí.              /   òjè ò ó bìbí.
         Oje SC C run staggeringly             Oje SC C move.zig.zaggedly
         ‘Oje is running with a stagger.’      ‘Oje is zigzagging.’Deverbal adverbs tend to be syntactically restricted. They occur in clauses inflected
for imperfect aspect. They reject perfect and prospective aspect.(144) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó tà        étá    rùrùrúrú.
         the man SC C speak words foolishly
         ‘The man is speaking foolishly.’
      b. ólí ómóhé ó ò tà        étá    rùrùrúrú.
         the man SC H speak words foolishly
         ‘The man speaks foolishly.’Deverbal adverbs correspond to direct questions framed by manner ébé'/ébí' …i
‘how’ or extent ébé'/ébí'…i…se ‘to what extent.’ Responses show adverbs in situ, not
as simple adverb phrases.
340 | Adverbial adjuncts(145) ébé' ólí ómóhé ó ò í           tà   étà?
      how the man SC H MAN speak words
      ‘How does the man speak?’
      ò ó tà       étá     rùrùrúrú.    /    *rùrùrúrú.
      he C speak words foolishly              foolishly
      ‘He is speaking foolishly.’             ‘Foolishly.’     Regarding polarity and mood, deverbal adverbs fail to appear in imperatives,
prohibitives, negative statements or polar questions, as an unacceptable polar ques-
tion suggests (*ólí ómòhè ò ó tà étá rùrùrúrú? [the man SC C speak words foolishly]
‘Is the man speaking foolishly?’).
     Discourse repositioning of deverbal adverbs is unacceptable. They fail in li/ni
focus position and in topic position.(146) *rùrùrúrú lí ólí ómóhé ó ò tà           étà.
       foolishly PF the man SC H speak word
       ‘It is foolishly that the man speaks.’6.8 Linear order of adverbs
Postverbal adverb classes exhibit order relations relative to a matrix verb.13 The
preferred order shows Manner nearest the verb and Temporal Deixis farthest from
the verb. Between these two are ordered Extent, Manner-demonstrative, Frequency,
Quantity and Place adverbs. Place is closer to Temporal-Deixis than Man-
ner/Frequency/Quantity. Order restrictions among classes also affect positioning
relative to complex predicates with postverbal particles or verbs in series.14                       V MA EX MD / FQ / QU / PL TDTemporal deictic adverbs (òdè) follow but do not precede adverbs of Place (vbí
áfúzé') and Aspectual Extent (sésésé).(147) a. ólí ómóhé dá'          ényó vbí áfúzé' òdè.

         he PAP.sweep the ground CS neatly yesterday
         ‘He swept up the ground neatly yesterday.’Within a single clause, adverbs of Aspectual Extent (vììn), Place (vbí ékóá) and Tem-
poral Deixis (òdè) appear only in that order.

poral Deixis. For instance, Manner lèsèn precedes adverbials of Temporal Deixis
