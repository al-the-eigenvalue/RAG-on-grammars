"Name vocatives can also be formed by accentual change alone as shown in (20)
above, ie. ABS → AP4:

(28)    Vocatives by accentual change
       Absolutive             Vocative
       Cali                   Cáli              'Ah'           (no change)
       Faadümo                Fáadumo           'Fatima'
       Múnse                  Mùnse             'Musa'         (a man's name)
       Warsáme                Warsame           'Warsame'      (a man's name)
       Guddoomiyé             Gúddoomiyé        'Chairman'
       Madaxweyné             Mádaxweyne        'President'
There is some variation in the use of these vocatives because of their sensitivity
to pragmatic factors: their use reflects the speaker's estimation of the
relationship with the addressee, including such factors as solidarity, respect,
affection, etc. The distinction between names and nouns is, of course, itself
subject to speaker control, for example in animal fables where we find animals
addressing each other, using nouns for species with name vocatives, e.g.
Shimbirèy 'Bird!' and Shinniyèy 'Bee!'.
        When nouns form noun phrases, case is marked phrasally, i.e. just once
on the final element of the noun phrase. Since noun phrases are head initial in
Somali, this means that the exponents of case may be marked not on the noun
but on modifying non-nominal elements such as determiners, adjectives, and
subordinate clause verbs. In subsequent sections we shall see the effect of this
phrasal case marking on a range of non-nominal categories. When the case
marking occurs on this phrase final position, the noun occurs in the default
absolutive case, as we can see in the subject marked noun phrases in the (b)
sentences below:(29)   (a)     nin               'a man'                      [ABS]
       (b)     nin               'a man                       [NOM]
(30)   (a)     ninka             'the man (non-remote)'       [ABS]
       (b)     ninka             'the man (non-remote)'       [NOM]
(31)   (a)     ninka dhèer       'the tall man'               [ABS]
       (b)     ninka dheeri      'the tall man'               [NOM]
Only when the noun nin 'man' stands alone, as in (29), is case marked on it; in
(30) the marking shifts to the determiner ka 'the', and in (31) to the adjective
dhèer 'tall'. In (30) and (31) the head noun nin shows absolutive case, though
the whole NP is subject.
                       GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                   674.1.2 Names
Names are nouns: they have inherent gender and are case marked, as we have
seen. Names do not normally occur in plural forms, with determiners, or as
heads of restrictive relative clauses, except in special circumstances, for example
Caligée 'which Ali?' and its possible reply:(32)   Cáligli Berbera jóogi jiray
       Cáli-kíi Berbera jóogi             jiray
       Ali-the   Berbera stay:in:INF used
       'the Ali who used to stay in Berbera'       Many personal names are of Arabic origin, for example the male names
Áxmed, Cábdi, Cáli, Maxámed, Sacíid and female names Faadúmo ('Fatima'),
Cáasho ('Ayesha'), and Maryámo ('Miriam'). Somali names are also regularly
used, for example, the male names Róoble 'Rain Bearer' and Warsáme 'Bearer
of Good News' and female names like Káaha 'Distant Light, Dawn', Déeqa
'Gift' and Hódan 'Wealth'. The naming system for both men and women
consists of a personal name followed by the father's personal name and then the
grandfather's name, forming a compound genitive list ' X (child) o f Y (child) of
Z', etc. The three names in normal use can be extended to a complete lineage.
Women do not change their names on marriage. Since case marking is phrasal
only the last element in a complex NP is case marked and thus only the last
name carries genitive case, the preceding names being in the absolutive:(33)   (a)    Maxámed        Axmed            Xasán
              Mohamed:ABS Ahmed.ABS           Hasan :GEN
              'Mohamed Ahmed Hasan'
       (b)    Câasha         Xásan            Axméd
              Ayesha:ABS     Hasan:ABS        Ahmed:GEN
              'Ayesha Hasan Ahmed'               Nicknames are commonly used and are useful since many people
share a relatively small stock of the commonest personal names. The nicknames
may reflect an attribute of the person's physique or character or may be tied to
specific incidents, perhaps in childhood. The nicknames are usually also nouns,
e.g. madóobe N M 'the black one' in Aadan Madóobe 'Adam the Dark' or
musmàar N M 'nail' in Cali Musmàar 'Ali "" N a i f "" . Such nicknames are
frequently in public use. Name and nickname combinations act accentually like
compound nouns (5.4.1), thus these examples have just one high tone on both
68                                  SOMALInames. This allows contrasts like the following, pointed out to me by B.W.
Andrzejewski:(34)     (a)   Cali Khàyr
               'Ali Khayr' (whose nickname is khàyr N M 'goodness')
         (b)   Cali Khàyr
               'Ali (son) of Khayr'4.1.3 Independent pronounsThe independent pronouns, which are also sometimes called substantive or
emphatic pronouns, contrast in function with the clitic or verbal pronouns
described in 4.2. The independent pronouns are grammatically nouns. They are
case marked, have inherent gender and show the syntax of nouns, including
functioning as subject and object, occurring as heads of relative clauses, being
focused by the nominal focus words bàa and ayàa, and occurring in isolation as
one word utterances. In Standard Somali they occur with the suffixed non-
remote definite article -kal-ta but may occur in an unsuffixed short form when
followed by a conjunction or focus word. The suffixed and short forms are
shown below, in (35) followed by the verb phrase conjunction -na 'and' and in
(36) by the focus word bàa:(35)   (a)     adígana                        (b)    adna
               adi-ka-na                             adi-na
               you:SG-the-and                        you:SG-and
               'and you...""                          'and you
(36)   (a)     adigàa                        (b)     adàa
               adi-ka-bàa                            adi-bàa
               you: SG-the-FOC                       you:SG -FOC
               'YOU' (focused)                       'YOU' (focused)        The set of independent pronouns is given below, with the determiner
separated off by a hyphen to show the short form. They provide an eight-person
system, with EXC 'exclusive' meaning 'not including the addressee(s)' and INC
'inclusive' meaning 'including the addressee(s)'. As the suffixed determiners
show, all of the pronouns are masculine in gender, except iyáda 'she, her'.","[80, 81, 82, 83]"

Preface
 In writing this book my aim has been to present an up-to-date and accurate
 picture of the grammar of Somali which will be of interest to non-specialists
 and linguists interested in language comparison and typology. Thus this
 volume is not intended as a manual for those wanting to teach themselves
 Somali nor a reference grammar for such a reader. Such books already exist;
 see Zorc and Issa (1990), Orwin (1995) and Saeed (1993a), for example. My
 aim is to highlight those areas that will give the reader a clear view of the
 grammatical characteristics of Somali and through Somali of what a Cushitic
 language is like. I have avoided pursuing the concerns of any particular
grammatical theory but nonetheless the book is firmly based on the
 assumptions and methodology of modern descriptive linguistics, and I have felt
free to refer to the theoretical and typological literature when the discussion
warrants it. The main focus of the book is on the morpho-phonology and syntax
 of the language, which fits naturally both the size of the book and the state of
our knowledge about Somali. Thus the phonetic description serves as
background to the discussion of phonological and morphological processes.
 Similarly, chapter 9 on discourse concentrates on those processes that are most
intimately related to grammatical rules.
         This work is based on study of the language over some twenty years, in
Somalia and Kenya, and with Somali speakers in Europe. I am indebted to a
number of academic institutions which have supported my work, particularly
my own college, Trinity College Dublin, and my department, the Centre for
Language and Communication Studies. I am also grateful for the support and
academic hospitality shown to me by the School of Oriental and African
Studies of the University of London, the Royal Irish Academy, the University
of Nairobi, Lafoole College of the National University of Somalia, and the
Somali National Academy of Culture. Many of the examples used in this book
are quoted from publications of Somali scholars and teachers associated with
the now sadly disbanded Somali National Academy of Culture, the Curriculum
Department of the Ministry of Education and Training, and the Somali
XII                                SOMALI
Language Commission. I express my thanks to these writers in the confident
hope that Somali scholarship will re-emerge after the current crisis in the
region.
        I am grateful to my editors Theodora Bynon and David Bennett for their
encouragement, suggestions and insightful comments. I would also like to
thank the following scholars who kindly sent me their own work and discussed
grammatical issues with me: Roberto Ajello, the late B.W. Andrzejewski,
Giorgio Banti, Lucyna Gebert, Mark Liberman, Jacqueline Lecarme, Mohamed
Diriye Abdullahi, Martin Orwin, Annarita Puglielli, and Mauro Tosco. Giorgio
Banti and Martin Orwin were also kind enough to read and comment on the
book in manuscript form. Any errors or misinterpretations are of course my
own responsibility.
        I am grateful to Cabdulaahi Dirir Xirsi for discussing many of the
examples with me and critically reviewing the translations of the Somali texts
in Appendix II. In Appendix II, the story Guurdoon 'Choosing a Bride' is used
by kind permission of the Scandinavian Institute of African Studies (Nordiska
afrikainstitutet); and the story Qaybtii Dawaco 'The Jackal's Division' is used
by kind permission of the editors of the Studi Somali series.
        Finally I would like to thank Joan Maguire for her encouragement and
good-humoured support for my strange interest in the intricacies of grammar. I
dedicate this book to her, to my mother and to the Somalis and Anglo-Somalis
of Liverpool.

  #              contextually inappropriateGlosses: Because of the morphological complexity of Somali and the frequency of
coalescence rules, it is often difficult to segment the surface forms into their constituent
morphemes. For clarity, in chapters 2-4 each example is accompanied by a morpheme
by morpheme breakdown which makes the underlying morphological structure
transparent. A gloss and translation accompany this. A simple example is:                 Wày iigá yeeshay
                 waa+ay     i+ú+ká           yeel+t-ay
                 DM+she me+for+from          accept+3SGF-PAST
                 'She accepted it from me for him.'","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
"      However subordinate clauses must occur with an overt subject; compare:
      (2)    (a)   Wúxuu       dóonayaa ínuu          tagó.
                   what+he     wants    that-he       go:suBORD             (b)  *Wúxuu dóonayaa in                tagó.
                 what+he wants            that      go:SUBORD
             'What he wants is to go,' He wants to go' (Lit. 'What he wants is that he go')
      Sentence (2b) is ungrammatical because there is no subject in the complement clause.
      Finally, it is perhaps also worth noting that the degree of optionality of subject pronouns
      in declarative sentences seems to vary across dialects in ways that remain to be
      documented.
67.   In this progressive auxiliary construction, merging of the main verb and the auxiliary
      has taken place to varying degrees in different Somali dialects. The resulting coalesced
      forms are no longer transparently auxiliary constructions.
68.   As discussed earlier, the fact that this cliticization process attaches the inflection of the
      copula verb yahay onto the adjectival stem has led some linguists to analyse adjectives
      as a type of (defective) verb. There does seem to be an ongoing process of merger of
      adjectives and verbs by this elision of the copula. This merging is exemplified by the
      item leeyahay 'have'. This form is clearly a merging of the adjective lé(h) 'having' and
      the copula yahay 'be' and all of its forms may be predicted by such a rule. Nonetheless,
      many descriptions by native speakers (e.g. Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi 1996:111) treat
      the item as a verb 'have' and it may well be that for speakers the form has been re-
      analysed as a simple verb.

 69.   Banti (1985:34) reports that in Benadir and May dialects this negative word occurs in
       the same position as the sentence type markers i.e. immediately preceding the VGP.
 70.   An interesting exception is the adjective dhán 'all' which presumably because of its
       meaning can only occur as a post-nominal modifier in an appositive relative clause, e.g.
       dádka óo dhán 'all the people'.
 71.   See 6.1.6 for further discussion.
 72.   Before uu 'he', má 'not' often assimilates to mu, for example the common
       pronunciation: Háwlba mú uu helm 'He found no work'.
 73.   Important studies of Somali focus include Hetzron (1965, 1971), Andrzejewski (1975a),
       Antinuci and Puglielli (1980), Antinucci (1980), Saeed (1984), Lecarme (1991,
       forthcoming), Ajello (1995) and Svolacchia et al. (1995).
 74.   In this section the focused element is shown in bold; elsewhere in the book we use small
       capitals just in the English gloss when discussing focus.
 75.   Though unlike many left dislocation structures cross-linguistically, bàalayàa structures
       do not allow coreferential clitic pronouns when the focused element is subject, as we
       shall see. As will also be clear from examples, left-dislocated elements focused by
       bàalayàa may be preceded by topic elements. We discuss the difficult question of word
       order in chapter 9.
76.    In addition they may not focus functional categories like classifiers, negative words,
       conjunctions, etc. The fact that the intensifier aad 'very, much' may be focused by
       bàalayàa suggests that like many adverbials this word is nominal in origin.
77.    This constraint is very strong. In addition bàalayàa constructions do not normally occur
       in the same sentence as wáxa(a) focus but, as described in chapter 9, the combination
       sometimes occurs, especially in narratives when a sentence initial adverbial may be
       focused by bàalayàa and later in the same sentence wáxa(a) is used to focus another
       sentence element, for example (where again focused elements are in bold):
       Beri baa        waxaa sheekeystay hal,           sac iyo           ri.
       time FOC        wáxa(a) conversed       camel:F cow and            goat:F
       Once there conversed a female camel, a cow and female goat.'         [FS 41.2]       Another context for this doubling, as in the example below sent to me by Martin Orwin,
       is news broadcasts, where a subject may be introduced by bàalayàa focus and what they
       say is then introduced by a wáxa(a) focus construction, e.g.:       Wakiilo ka tirsan kooxaha             mucaaradka  waddanka Ciraaq
       delegates from counted parties-the opposition-the and country-the Iraq
       ayaa waxay            sheegeen inay        ku heshiiyeen         inay...
       FOC     wàxa(a)+they reported that-they on agreed                that-they...
       'Representatives of the Iraqi opposition parties reported that they had agreed to...'
       (BBC Somali Service, Evening news bulletin, 23 November 1998)
                                      NOTES                                               27578.   By maximal projection of a head, we mean the largest (or most inclusive) phrase of
      which it is the head; or in co-ordinate structures, the unit consisting of all of the co­
      ordinates.
79.   For example Antinucci and Puglielli (1980) suggested an analysis where relative clauses
      underlyingly contain focus words on their heads which are then obligatorily deleted.
      This was criticised in Saeed (1984) where I proposed the opposite line: wáxa(a) focus is
      derived from relative clauses headed by wáx-a 'the tiling, what' and bàalayàa
      constructions are derived from wáxa(a) focus by a fronting rule. I no longer consider
      this plausible as a synchronic rule and indeed Lecanne (forthcoming) shows that
      asymmetries between wáxa(a) and bàalayàa constructions make this derivation
      unconvincing. In this study Lecarme proposes an analysis within a Chomskyan
      Minimalist approach. This seeks to capture the similarities by assigning bàalayàa focus
      and relative clauses a similar phrase structure with the focused element and the relative
      clause head as sentence external elements co-indexed with an empty argument within
      the sentence.      No doubt other proposals will emerge to give a synchronic
      characterisation of what is probably an ongoing historical process.
80.   Here qabán is a short form of the future gabán doonaa 'I will catch' (4.3.3.8).
81.   Of course, as we saw in (42), if a direct quotation is introduced by wáxa(a) it may itself
      include  wáxa(a) construction. This is also true of bàalayàa constructions. We must
      therefore distinguish between direct quotation, which may contain independent main
      clauses, and clausal subordination.
82.   Though in Saeed (1984) tins is described as a synchronic syntactic rule.
83.   For an alternative analysis see Lecarme (1991) which proposes that wáxa(a)
      constructions are a form of extraposition rule involving an expletive wáx focused by
      bàa.
84.   As reported by Banti (1985: 30) central varieties of Standard Somali combine the
      negative word áan and the subject pronouns in the opposite order, i.e. ma + aan T +
      áan 'not' → miyàanàn:ma + aad 'you (SG)' + áan 'not' → miyàadàn; ma + uu 'he' +
      áan 'not' → miyùusán, etc. Here we note that the vowel of áan 'not' is shortened and
      the 3MS pronoun uu 'he' occurs as uus.
85.   Though as we see below, ma may occur suffixed to the questioned element.
86.   Though independent pronouns may be used for emphasis and will be subject marked,
      for example:      Adigu         hayla         hadlin!
      you:SG:SUBJ ha+me+with speak:NEG:sG
      'You, don't speak (SG) to me! ' [SHN 92.7]87.   Consequently in southern dialects in which subject marking is reduced or non-existent,
      subordinate clauses are less distinguished from main clauses: see Lamberti (1983) and
      Banti (1985) for some details.
88.   Thus restrictive relative clauses do not occur modifying proper nouns (names).
276                                    SOMALI 89.   We can recognise here the general principle, described in 6.2.4, that nominals may only
       support one modifier before co-ordination is triggered.
 90.   See Antinucci and Puglielli (1980) and Saeed (1984) for discussion of this phenomenon.
       It seems reasonable to suppose that the gap in subject position inside the clause is not
       sufficient to trigger full subject agreement on the verb.
 91.   Note that as usual with co-ordination, a list of conjuncts may just have a conjunction
       between the last two items, for example:       Waa baa waxaa jirey nin gaabaan, faruuran               oo    aad     foolxun
       time FOC wáxa(a) was man short             hare-lipped and intens ADP ugly
       'Once there was a man who was short, hare-lipped and very ugly'   [SHS 53.37] 92.   We can gloss islá márka as 'the same time'; see for example a comparable expression
       islá sánnadkáa 'that same year'. The syntax of these expressions is unusual since, as we
       have seen, nominal modifiers usually follow the head NP in Somali and clitic clusters
       such as islá are more typical of the verbal group (6.1).
 93.   In (59) la'áan is a feminine noun 'state of being without' derived from the adjective lá'
       'without, lacking, not possessing', as described in 5.3.2. Here the derived noun
       incorporates the nominal object of the adjective to form the complex nominal tigídh
       la 'áan 'the-state of being without a ticket'. This type of incorporation by adjectives is
       discussed briefly in 5.4.
 94.   Perhaps a better English gloss for this particular usage would be 'case' or 'instance'.
       Compare the related use of the word in the expression haddíi kalé 'otherwise' (lit. 'the
       other case').
 95.   Here, as in the rest of this section, focused elements are shown in small capitals.
 96.   Of course the use of names like 'Ali' in this example means that the identity of the
       individuals has to be known. As discussed later in this section, we must make a
       distinction between knowledge that the interlocutors might have and knowledge that is
       'activated' in the conversation and thus linguistically marked in some way.
97.    These all-new sentences are of course rather uncommon in ordinary conversation.
       Support for this observation that subjects in them attract focus comes from another
       context in which all-new sentences are used: the beginning sentences of news stories
       and bulletins. So for example in the fifty-one Somali news stories in Issa and Murphy
       (1984), twenty seven have first sentences containing bàalayàa focus, rather than
       wáxa(a) constructions, etc. Of these twenty-seven, twenty-three have bàalayàa focus
       on the subject compared with four with focus on the object. Moreover in two of the
       latter the subject is a clitic pronouns which cannot receive focus.
98.    Or in an alternative metaphor, become foregrounded in consciousness and then fade into
       the background. For discussions of this notion of salience/activation see Chafe (1976),
       Prince (1981, 1985), Givón (1983), and Dryer (1996).
99.    For various views of the factors governing subject assignment see Kuno (1987), Wilkins
       (1988), Givón (1990), Williams (1994).
                                       NOTES                                                277100. Note that the time adverbial waa 'once' receives bàa/ayàa focus as described later in
     this section.
101. Or 'presentative' structures to use the term proposed by Hetzron (1971).
102. As Lecarme (1991, fortlicoming) notes, tliese sentences are a problem for a simple and
     coherent view of bàa focus. While it is clear that wáx here is an indefinite NP, and thus
     formally a candidate for 'new' information, it seems odd that an almost lexically empty
     element like this should receive focus. This is especially so since this sentence is a
     possible answer to the questionMaxáad saméynaysaa? 'What are you doing?'
103. Including, as we saw in chapter 7, the adverbial intensifier àad 'much' 'many'.
104. Remembering that, as outlined in 4.8, sentence type markers are usually sensitive to the
     difference between positive and negative sentences.
105. It is worth noting that the problem of identifying the functions of preverbal grammatical
     morphemes is a common one in Cushitic languages. See for example the discussion of
     'preverbal selectors' in Arbore in Hayward (1984). As Hayward notes, part of these are
     clearly sentence type identifiers. We might also note the discussion of Dahalo
     'selectors' in Tosco (1991), and Oromo 'preverbal elements' in Stroomer (1987).
106. For discussions of the syntactic status of this core predication see Lecarme
     (forthcoming) and Svolacchia, Mereu and Puglielli (1995).
107. We may speculate that the formalised structure of the story and its sequence of girls
     allow the existence of a further girl to be pragmatically implied or expected.
108. For general discussions of Somali poetry see Andrzejewski and Lewis (1964),
     Andrzejewski (1985), and Banti (1987). For descriptions of poetic genres and metrical
     forms, see Johnson (1979, 1984, 1996), Guuleed (1980), Andrzejewski (1982), Banti &
     Giannattasio (1996), and Orwin & Riiraash (1997). Briefly, the various poetic types are
     characterised by different metrical structures. The gabay, for example, may consist of
     more than a hundred lines, each of which contains twenty moras, typically divided into
     four equal feet of five moras each. As mentioned in chapter 2, only vowels are counted
     in establishing moras. The details of the various mappings between moras, feet,
     syllables and lines in each poetic form are described in the works cited above. In
     addition the major poetic types are characterised by alliteration, which may be of two
     types: consonantal and vowel. In consonantal alliteration, one consonant must be used
     to alliterate throughout the poem. In vowel alliteration all vowels are considered to
     alliterate with each other, whatever the quality. Text 6 has consonantal alliteration in the
     sound g. Since this poem is a geerar, its line structure requires that one word in each
     line must alliterate. Text 5 has vowel alliteration. Since it is a gabay, its line structure
     requires that each half line must contain at least one alliterating word.

"Furthermore, as we discuss in chapter 3, some sentence type markers, like the
question word ma, have variable tone depending on the presence of High tones
in their environment. Nevertheless it is very clear that the mapping between
tone patterns and words is very restricted and predictable: Somali does not
show the full range of tonal patterns we would expect if each syllable or mora
were independent of others in the word.
       The basic tone patterns of roots are changed by grammatical or
derivational processes. This will become very clear in later chapters, but we can
select two typical examples here. When nouns are assigned case as part of
                          PHONOLOGICAL UNITS                                   23
sentences, this is marked largely by tone. Example (34) below shows the case
forms of the proper noun Cáli ' M ' revealing the associated tonal and suffix
changes:(34) absolutive case (= citation): Cali
     nominative case:              Cali
     genitive case: Cali
     vocative: Cáli or Cáliyôw [←*Cáliyów]We discuss accentual case marking further in chapter 3. As a second example
we take one ofthe derivational processes where an affix is used to create verbs
from nouns and adjectives, in this case the suffix which has the form -êe (Falling
tone) in the imperative form used for verb citation forms. The addition of this
suffix flattens any High tones in the stem to Low, leaving the derived verb with
Pattern 2 in (32) above, High on the penultimate mora. This is phonetically
realised as a Falling tone on the final long vowel. We can see examples ofthis:(35)   cásho     N      'eveningmeal'    cashêe V        'eattheeveningmeal'
       dháb N 'truth' dhabêe V 'confirm'
       dhêer ADJ 'long' dheerêe V 'move fast'In fact a wide range of morphological and syntactic processes change the basic
tone patterns of word roots. These changes will be described in the relevant
 sections of this book. What is clear is that tone patterns in Somali are word-
based and reflect a combination ofthe word's inherent syntactic class and the
tonal markers ofgrammatical information.
       These basic features allow us to commentbriefly on the typology ofthe
Somali tone system. If we adopt the traditional distinction between intonation
languages, tone languages and pitch accent languages, it seems clear that Somali
is not an intonation language. As we have seen, Somali does not use pitch
patterns for the types of sentence level information that we find in English and
other European languages. Somali uses tone to make contrasts of meaning at
the word level. However, the position of Somali in relation to the distinction
between tone languages proper and pitch accent languages is less immediately
obvious. We may take the defining characteristics ofpitch accent languages like
Japanese to be as follows: words may have no more than one accent per word;
this accent is realised by pitch prominence; and the accent is relatively
unaffected by intonation (Cruttenden 1986). The features we have seen in
Somali word roots: their restricted tonal patterns, in particular the fact that
common nouns, verbs and adjectives contain only one High tone in their basic
24                                  SOMALI
 form, makes an accentual analysis seem plausible and such analyses have been
 proposed by Hyman (1981) and Banti (1988b). The basic idea ofthis type of
 approach is that underlyingly, or lexically, Somali roots have no inherent tone.
Rules of accent placement determine the position of a single accented mora in
 each root, which is then phonetically realised as a high pitch segment. These
rules ofaccent placement are governed by grammatical information, for example
what syntactic class the root is, which declension or conjugation, etc.
 Subsequently morphological and syntactic rules may change the placement of
this accented mora and thus ofthe associated High tone. This seems a plausible
line ofapproach for Somali and we discuss it further in chapter 3. What is clear
is that Somali uses tone quite differently from Asian tone languages like Chinese
and Korean and with significant differences from better known types of African
tone languages like Igbo, Hausa, or the Bantu languages. Similar tone accent
systems have been reported for other Cushitic languages, notably Oromo
(Andrzejewski 1970, Owens 1980, 1982, 1985, Banti 1988b).
       Tone is not marked in the official Somali orthography. In the rest of this
book we will mark the tone of words and constructions recorded from speech
but not attempt to tone mark texts and examples taken from published Somali
sources. We will adopt a conservative strategy in the marking of tones,
identifying the three 'surface' tones on syllables, rather than the underlying
moraic structure, as follows:(36)   High tone:       on short vowels                 ά
                        on long vowels and diphthongs   áa   áy
       Low tone:        on short vowels                 a
                        on long vowels and diphthongs   aa   ay
       Falling tone:    on long vowels and diphthongs   àa   àyWe will only mark underlying moraic forms, for example the sequence of High
and Low tones underlying the Falling tone, when discussing the details of the
tonal system.
Chapter 3
Phonological Rules
In this chapter we outline some of the main types of phonological rules in
Somali. We include both phonological rules proper and morphophonological
rules, that is, rules which are triggered by or restricted to some grammatical
categories. Some rules of allophonic variation, for example the tendency for b
and d to spirantize to [β] and [ð] intervocalically, were described in chapter 2.","[37, 38, 39, 40]"
"     Other suffixes have no effect on the stem AP except to append their own
inherent accentual pattern to the new stem, for example the remote definite
article -kíil-tíi 'the' :(64)   gúri N M [AP2] 'house'           →     gúrigíi     'thehouse(remote)'
       mìis N M [AP2] 'table'           →     mìiskíi     'thetable(remote)'
       arrín N F [AP1] 'affair'         →     arríntíi    'theaffair(remote)'
44                                     SOMALI
         naag NF     [AP1] 'woman'       →      náagtíi       'thewoman(remote)'Note that this suffix thus creates a noun phrase with two High tones.
    Another important role ofAP changes is to mark case on nominals. These
accentual changes are also accompanied by suffixation in some noun declensions
but the marking is predominantly accentual. There is a basic unmarked case
which we term the absolutive (ABS); this is used with nominals in a range of
contexts: in isolation, as objects ofverbs and adpositions, when focused, etc.
The other cases are nominative, genitive and vocative, each of which can be
conveniently viewed as modifications to the basic absolutive form. In order to
describe case marking we need to add another accentual pattern:(65) AP4: High tone on the first mora, Low elsewhere.","[58, 59]"
"The possessive determiners occur without the article ka/ta to mark a semantic
distinction similar to the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession
found in many languages: possessives without suffixed articles are used with
nouns for family members, parts of the body, and by extension for close friends:(127)          aabbáháy            'my father'
               hooyádáa            'your mother
               lúgtéed             'her leg'
 116                                     SOMALI                 saaxìibkìin          'your (PL) friend'When possessives occur in this way without a following second determiner, they
are noun phrase final elements and must carry case marking, exhibited by
accentual changes.    The accentual patterns on the pre-article possessive
determiners in (125) above on the other hand show no case marking 38 . When
possessives are noun phrase final, they show a distinction between absolutive
and nominative case as follows (shown on aabbé N M 'father'):                 Absolutive       Nominative
                 aabbáháy         aabbàhày         'my father'
                 aabbáháa         aabbahàa         'your (SG) father'
                 aabbíhiís        aabbihìis        'his father'
                 aabbáhéed        aabbahèed        'her father'
                 aabbáháyo        aabbahayo        'our (EXC) father'
                 aabbáhéen        aabbahèen        'our (INC) father'
                 aabbíhíin        aabbihin         'your (PL) father'
                 aabbáhóod        aabbahòod        'their father'
The possessive determiners perform some important semantic functions. As
shown below, they are used to mark partitive quantification, including the use of
numerals. In this function the possessives are used in their inalienable form.(129)   dàdka giddigóod                       (cf. gíddi N M 'all, entirety')

4.4.3 Attributive        adjectivesWhile most adjectives can occur both attributively and predicatively, there is a
small group that occurs only attributively.            M a n y , but not all, o f these are
derived f r o m nouns by a suffix -e, f o r example dhexé 'between' f r o m dhéx N F
'middle, centre'. Some other important examples are:
                 dambé                 'behind, later, last, next'
                 hoosé                 'lower' (cf. hóos N F 'lower part, bottom')
                 horé                  'first, former, previous' (cf. hór N F 'front')
                 kalé                  'other'
108                                       SOMALI
           kastá                       'each'
           koré                        'upper' (cf. kór N M 'top, surface')
           saré                        'topmost, uppermost, high'
           shishé                      'far, further, beyond'
           soké                        'near, close'
           wál                         'each, every'
Nouns modified by the adjective wál are usually followed by the adverbial ba
'any' (4.10.4), i.e. nin walba 'each man, every man'. For some speakers this
combination is frozen into a composite attributive adjective. This can be seen
from subject marking, where instead of nin waliba with the nominative suffix -i
attaching to the adjective (as the last element in the nominal), the form used is
nín walbi (←walba-i), where the nominative case suffix attaches after the
adverbial.
      Another element which is intermediate between an attributive adjective
and an adverbial is the word uun 'some, other, only, just, mere(ly)', discussed in
4.10.5. This word appears adjective-like as a post-nominal modifier, e.g.:(101)          már uun 'sometime or other'             (már N M 'time')
               méel uun 'someplace or other'           (méel N F 'place'
               wáx uun 'something or other'            (wáx N M 'thing')4.4.4 Agreement featuresAdjectives show no gender differentiation in agreement with nouns but the
reduplication process described in 3.5 marks plural agreement, e.g. nirnán
yaryâr 'small men', naagó waawèyn 'big women'. The use of these reduplicated
plural forms is subject to some variation, with the tendency being that the longer
the adjective the less likely speakers are to use the reduplicated forms. Because
of the phrasal operation of case marking in Somali (described in 4.1.1.4)
modifying adjectives do not agree in case with the head noun: as with all noun
phrases only the last element carries case marking. I f the adjective is the last
element then subject marking will apply in the usual way, i.e. to lower any high
tones in the adjective and since all regular adjectives end in a consonant, to add
the nominative suffix -/' described for nouns in 4.1.1.4. See for example:                    Ab solutive case             Nominative case
                     dhèer                        dheeri                'tall'
                     wanaagsán                    wanaagsani           'good'
                     yár                          yari                 'small'
                         GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                109Note that the purely attributive adjectives, except for wál 'each', end in vowels,
and thus do not show the nominative suffix but still have lowered tones, e.g.
savé ABS 'topmost' → scire NOM (but wál ABS 'each' →wali NOM).","[122, 123, 124]"
"4.1.1.4 Case
As described briefly in chapter 3, the marking of case on nouns is largely
accentual, with some use of suffixes. The basic unmarked case we termed the
absolutive (ABS). This is the case nouns show when in isolation, as objects of
verbs and adpositions, or when focused. It is convenient to treat it as the base
form because it is the most basic form morphologically and also because its
accentual patterns are less predictable than the other cases. There is a general
tendency for feminine singular nouns to have A P I in the absolutive, while
masculine singular have AP2 and all plurals, A P I .        However there are
exceptions: masculine nouns in declensions 2 B and 7 have A P I in the singular
while declension 6 nouns have AP2 in the plural. The other cases are more
predictable and can best be viewed as modifications to the underlying absolutive
form. In chapter 3 we gave the following typical accentual case marking
pattern:(20)            Nominative (NOM)        Genitive (GEN)         Vocative (VOC)
       ABS→        AP3                      API                  AP4
64                                   SOMALI
All nouns follow this pattern for the genitive case and for vocatives marked by
accentual change alone. We discuss other vocatives below. Most nouns follow
this pattern for nominative case too except for non-plural feminine nouns ending
in -o and masculine nouns ending in -e which have AP2 in the nominative, for
example hooyó F ABS 'mother' → hóoyo NOM; tuké M ABS 'crow' → túke NOM.
      In addition to these accentual changes the case system involves suffixes.
In the nominative and genitive cases suffixes attach to phonologically specified
classes of nouns. In the nominative, feminine nouns ending in a consonant have
a suffix -/, for example nàag F ABS 'woman' → naagi NOM. In the genitive
case, feminine nouns not ending in -o add a suffix -eed, (or -yeed i f the noun
ends in i), for example:(21) áf shimbiréed
       âf                    s hi mbiré ed
       mouth:M:SG:ABS         bird:F:SG:GEN
       'mouth of bird, a beak'A few nouns for domestic animals, e.g. ló ' F 'cattle', daméer F 'female donkey',
hál 'female camel' take a suffix -aad, e.g.(22)   caanó lo 'áad
       caanó           lo 'áad
       milk:M:COLL:ABS cattle:F:SG:GEN
       'cow's milk1Polar masculine plurals ending in o, formed from feminine singular nouns, have
a genitive suffix -od, e.g.(23)   hádal naagóod
       hàdal          naagóod
       talk:M:SG:ABS women :M:PL: GEN
       'women's talk'      Names and nouns used as forms of direct address occur in the vocative
case. There are two basic forms: vocatives by accentual change alone, as we
have already seen, and those formed with suffixes. Cross-cutting this formal
distinction there are two functional classes: the first is used for people's names,
nouns of kinship and friendship, for the names of occupations when used
respectfully, and for the names of God. This class reflects degrees o f solidarity
and/or respect. The second class is more neutral and tends to be used with
common nouns. We can call the first class name vocatives and the second noun

vocatives, and show the relationship between the formal and functional classes

Name                √           √
Noun                 -          √
Turning to suffixed forms first, both name and noun vocatives have two forms.
One is used with feminine singular nouns, including feminine collectives and
mass nouns which take singular concord, and the other with masculine singular
nouns and plurals:(25)   Vocative suffixes
                        Name                  Noun
       FSG             -èey/àaylòoy         -yahay
       M SG & PL        -òw                  -yohowThe choice between F SG -èeylàaylòoy is phonologically conditioned: nouns
ending in a take -àay; those ending in o take -òoy; and all others take -èey.
These suffixes also occur in short vowel variants: -èylàylòy. When name
vocative suffixes are added to stems ending in the short vowels e, a or o the
vowel is deleted, losing any associated tone. Stems ending in /' will usually have
an epenthetic consonant y inserted. All vocative suffixes append their own AP
without altering the stem's original AP. 27 See below for some examples of these
phonological effects:(26)   Suffixed name vocatives

noun phrase; in (91) the relative clause head is subject of its main sentence and
kéenayaa is marked for nominative case. This example enables us to see the
syntactic information carried by the inflectional system in verbs. The present
progressive form kéenayä in (90) signals three independent pieces of syntactic
information: (a) that the verb is in a subordinate clause; (b) that its subject is a
gap coreferential with the relative clause head; and (c) that this head nominal is
not subject of the main clause.344.3.5 Prefix Verb ParadigmsAs mentioned earlier, in Standard Somali there are four prefix or 'strong' verbs:
yidhi 'say', yimi 'come', yiil 'be (in a place)' and yiqiin 'know', giving them in
their reference forms of 3.SG.M past simple. We mentioned too that under
pressure from the suffix verbs, there is considerable regional variation in the
forms of these verbs. The following are the forms commonly used in northern
varieties of the language, with some common variations shown by the use of
parentheses. We list the verbal paradigms in the same order as for suffix verbs,
abbreviating the description somewhat to avoid repetition. Note that unlike
suffix verbs these verbs distinguish between 1SG and 3SGM in simple forms.","[111, 112]"
"      The second major feature ofthe Somali tone system is that its function is
to signal grammatical rather than lexical contrasts. In our noun examples so far
we have seen tone patterns marking distinctions of gender and number. In fact
tonal patterns in nouns are predictable from the noun's number, gender and
declension class. As we shall see in chapter 4, it is possible to establish
declensions of nouns, each with their characteristic tonal pattern, gender, and
way offorming plurals. Similarly individual verbal conjugations have associated
tonal patterns. Any apparently lexical contrasts, such as between the nouns inan
'boy' and inán 'girl' are by-products, so to speak, ofthe primary grammatical
distinction, in this instance of gender. Other functions of the tonal system
include case marking on nouns, as we shall see below.
      A third feature of the tonal system is its independence from sentence
intonation. Because the tonal system employs pitch for essentially word level
grammatical information, it is not free to carry sentence level information such
as sentence type distinctions or information structure contrasts such as
emphasis, or focus. Thus questions, for example, are not distinguished from
statements by pitch tunes as in some other languages like English, but by the use
ofspecific morphemes, as shown in (30):(30)   (a)         Má         imáneyaa?
                       QM is:coming
                       'Is he coming?'
       (b)              Wâa imáneyaa.
                        DM is:coming
           'He is coming.'
22                                    SOMALI
Similarly to emphasise or focus on a constituent, Somali speakers use one ofthe
focus particles introduced in 4.7; in example (31) below the focus particle bâa
marks the noun búug 'book' as in focus:(31)           Bûug bûu          k
               bûug bâa+uu keenay

"5.4.1 Compound nouns
Compound nouns are very common and consist of a number of different types.
One class we could call lexicalised noun phrases. These have the form of
syntactically well-formed noun phrases, though of course their accentual pattern
identifies them as single words. These compounds are therefore head-initial and
may include various types of modifier elements, for example adjectives in (62);
nouns with genitive case endings in (63); and as described earlier, relative clause
constructions containing a head, a complement noun and the adjective Iéh

       A second class of compound noun is composed of the sequence noun +
noun (N + N). These compounds are also head-initial and parallel independent
genitive constructions, though once again they are tonally marked as words, for
example:(65)   (a)     afgúri     Ν Μ 'dialect'             (lit. 'language-of-house')
               from:       áf     NM         'language'
                          gúri    ΝΜ         'house, home'
       (b)     birdánab Ν Μ 'magnet'                (lit. 'iron-of-electricity')
               from:      bir     NF         'iron, metal'
                          dánab   NM        'thunderbolt, electricity'
       (c)     dábdhul N Μ         'volcanoι'       (lit. 'fire-of-earth')

       (d)     xiddígdhul N M ' hedgehog '          (lit. 'star-of-ground')
               from:      xiddig  NF        'star'
                          dhúl    NM        'earth, ground, soil'       There are few examples of N + N compounds where the head occurs
finally: one productive exception is provided by compounds with the noun
aqóon N F 'knowledge' as the second element, for example:(66)   beeraqóon     N F 'agronomy'            cf. béer     NF 'farm'
       cayayaanaqóon N F 'entomology'          cf. cayayàan N M 'insects'
       cìraqóon      NF 'meteorology'          cf. cír      N M 'sky, atmosphere'
       nololaqóon    N F 'biology'             cf. nolól    NF 'life'       The third and perhaps the commonest class of compound nouns are
deverbal, or synthetic, compounds, where the final element is a verbal noun
derived from a verb root.          In these compounds the preceding noun is
semantically related to the verbal noun in the same way as it would be to a verb
in a corresponding clause. We can classify these compounds by the particular
role the first noun bears in relation to the verbal noun. We begin with probably
the commonest type: where the verbal noun is formed from a transitive verb
stem and the preceding noun functions semantically like its object. Here there
are two sub-types. The first, exemplified in (67) below, consists of compounds
where the verbal noun is derived by category shift of the root as described in
5.3.1 (sometimes called 'zero affixation' or 'conversion'), and the subject
argument is unspecified.

                from:    af            NM                 'language

                         -e                             agentive suffix (see 5.3.2)

an oblique argument, i.e. governed by and followed by a verbal adposition, as in
(69) below, or performing an adverbial function, as in (70):(69)    (a)     cidlajóog     NF 'domestic animal' (lit. 'stay-with-people')
                from:         cíd     NF           'people, family'

                      dhaló VMIDINTR 'be born'In these compounds, like those in (67), the verbal noun is formed by simple
category shift (or zero affixation) and the subject argument is unspecified.

      In some deverbal compounds the first noun acts as subject of the verbal
noun, which is derived by category shift from an intransitive verb, for example:(71)   (a)    biyádhac N M 'waterfall'              (lit. 'water-fall')
              from:     biyó       ΝΜ       'water'

                       xanùun      V INTR 'be in pain, ache'
       (c)    dabaqallòoc    Ν Μ 'scorpion'         (lit. 'tail-crook')

                       báx         v INTR 'go/come out'       In our examples so far of deverbal compounds we have used relatively
simple examples. More complicated examples are very common since either of
the nominal elements may be more complex. For example, corresponding to the
compounds in (67) we find examples where the first nominal is a noun phrase
rather than a simple noun:(72)   warxungèe     NM   'large poisonous spider sp.' (lit 'bad-news-carry')
       from: wár      NM     'news'
              xún     ADJ    'bad'
              gèe     V TR 'carry, convey, bear'Similarly the verbal noun may be derived from a verb which is itself derived
from another category, noun or adjective. For example, paralleling the
compounds in (68) we find:(73)   codweyneeyé NM        'loudspeaker' (lit. 'voice-magnifier')
       from: cód    NM        'voice'
              wèyn    ADJ     'big'
              ays             factitive affix (here ; see 5.1.3)
              ye              agentive suffix (here j e ; see 5.3.2)Here the agentive verbal noun weyneeyé 'magnifier' (also 'microscope') is based
on the verb weynèe 'make bigger, increase', which is derived from the adjective
160                                    SOMALI
wèyn 'big'. The processes of derivation and compounding may be repeated in
this way to form increasingly complicated compound nouns.","[171, 172, 173, 174, 175]"
"Typically, declaratives with waa are used when all the nominal referents are
known and may be omitted. Noun phrases, when used, act like adjuncts or
topics and may occur before or after the verbal group, for example:(4)     waanadii      waan            qaatay.
        advice-the    DM+I you+from took
      Ί took the advice from you'          [SHN 124. 22-3]
(5)    waannu             is     mehersannay     aniyo isagu.
       DM+we:EXCL         RE     married         I-and    him
      'We married each other I and him'    [SIIN 126. 23] The position and order of these NPs is free and does not reflect their
grammatical functions, unlike clitic pronouns within the verbal group which, as
we saw in chapter 6, have a subject-object-verb (s-o-v) order. Wherever they
occur such NPs are case marked; thus the NP aniyo isagu ' I and him' is subject
marked, carrying the nominative case form of the definite article -gu on the final
syllable.
       Since waa declarative sentences are typically used when all the referents
are known, they are common in casual conversation but much less common in
narratives or the written prose of newspaper reports, letters, etc., where new
information is more frequent and thus focus is used.
      Negative declaratives without focus are distinguished by two
characteristics: the sentence type marker waa is replaced by the negative word
má\: and the verb occurs in a special negative form. As described in 4.3, each
verbal paradigm displaying a tense and aspectual distinction has both positive
and negative forms. The negative past paradigms (past simple, past progressive
and past habitual) are characterised by invariable forms which do not show
person agreement. As mentioned in chapter 6, the negative word má 'not'
occurs within the verbal group and often occurs without subject clitic pronouns,
for example:
 186                                    SOMALI
(6)     (a)    Qálabkíi       má      jebín.

               'I/you/he/she etc. did not break the machine.'
        (b)    Kumá       arkin.
               you-not     saw:PAST SIMPLE:NEG
               'I/he/she/etc. did not see you.'","[200, 201]"
"Thus we can compare the main clause and subordinate verbs in the (a) and (b)
pair below:(85)    (a)       Wùm keenaa.
                 waa+uu keenaa
                 DM+he        brings:MAIN:PRES GEN:3SG M
                 'He brings it'
        (b)      innu keenó
                 in-uu keenó
                 that-he brings:SUBORD:PRES GEN:3SG M
                 'that he brings it'      We can show the second marking system, of case, by comparing subject
marked and absolutive subordinate verb forms. Segmentally, subject marked
verb forms have the same ending as main clause verbs; in other words the
change -aa to -ol-id found in absolutive forms does not occur. Accentually,
subject marking follows the main rule for nominals: the verb becomes AP3, i.e.
any high tones are lowered. Since most main clause positive verbs have AP3,
this means that subject marked positive subordinate verbs have the same form as
the corresponding main clause forms. However, as can be seen from the
paradigms earlier in this section, many main clause negative verb forms have
high tones and for these verbs, subject marked subordinate clause forms (with
AP3) are distinct from main clause forms, e.g.:(86)   (a)     Inaanán arkini waa yàab
               in-aan-aan arkini                waa    yàab
               that-not-I     saw:NEG:SUBJ DM           surprise
               That I did not see it is surprising.""
       (b)    Má 'aan arkin.
               má-aan arkin
               not-I      saw:NEG
               T did not see it.'
                       GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                    95 Since the clause in (86a) is subject of the sentence, the verb arkini carries the
 markers of subject case: AP3, i.e. all low tones, and the subject case suffix -i
 described in 4.1.1.4. The corresponding main clause verb arkin in (86b) has
 neither of these inflectional features.
       We can see in this asymmetry between positive and negative verbs the
result of an interaction between different uses of the same accentual distinction.
high versus low is a marker of absolutive versus subject case in nominals, while
in the verbal system low tones are characteristic of positive paradigms and high
tones of negative paradigms. When the two systems interact in the case
marking of clauses, we find that subordinate absolutive forms and main negative
forms pattern together accentually, while subordinate subject forms and main
positive forms are accentually similar.
       All subordinate clauses verbs are case-marked in this way. Relative clause
verbs, however, show some extra agreement features compared with other
clause verbs. The structure of relative clauses is described in 8.1; we might note
in particular that the relative clause follows the nominal it modifies and that
there is no relative pronoun: the position of the relativised element, coreferential
with the head nominal, is marked by a gap. Our first observation is that, as
phrase final elements in the NP, relative clause verbs are marked for the role of
their head nominal in the main clause. Compare the following where we
schematically represent the relative clause structure (REL = relative clause):(87) (a)        Èeg       |NP qalabka    [REI aannu kú shaqèynaynó ]] !
           look:IMP:SG    equipment-the       we    with are:working
           'Look at the equipment that we are working with!'
     (b)   [NP Qálabka [REL aannu kú shaqèynaynaa]] waa dhàwr jâad.
           equipment         we      with are:working        DM several kind
           The equipment that we are working with is (of) several kinds.'","[109, 110]"
"
           The semantic and functional similarity between these morphemes and
prepositions and postpositions in other languages is clear; and indeed there have
been attempts, f o r example Biber (1984a), t o derive t h e m historically f r o m
stranded postpositions.              However,      their    synchronic     syntactic    position    as
members o f the pre-verbal cluster leads to difficulties in labelling the category.
I n Saeed (1993a), f o r example, w r i t t e n for English-speaking learners I f o l l o w e d
Bell (1953)        in calling them        prepositions,      changing     in    Saeed (1993b)       to
adpositions. Other terms used for them have included prepositional particles
(Andrzejewski 1960), locative particles, and case markers (Biber 1984a).                             If
these morphemes only governed non-arguments o f the verb one might t e r m
them 'adverbial clitics'.          H o w e v e r , as w i t h English prepositions, some verbs
require them to introduce a second or third obligatory argument (for example
kú...rid     'put i n ' ) . I n still others they are lexicalised or ' f r o z e n ' into verb-particle
units w h i c h are semanticaly opaque (for example lá...báx               'elope', literally   leave
                         GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                         111
with', or ka...céli 'defend', literally 'send back from'). For present purposes we
will continue to call them verbal adpositions, while recognising the shortcomings
of the label. The position of adpositions in the verbal group is described in
chapter 6, and the coalescence rules which affect them are described in chapter
3.
       We might note that there are other ways of marking spatial and temporal
relations: firstly, Somali has borrowed one nominal preposition from Arabic,
ilâa 'until', which therefore forms a class of its own. It is used pre-nominally to
form prepositional phrases, e.g. ilâa berrito 'until tomorrow', iláa Hargeysá 'as
far as Hargeysa'. Secondly, a very productive way of describing location
involves nominal possessor-possessed constructions using the suffixed
possessive determiners, as described in 4.6.4, for example:(111)       gúriga hóostìisa
            gúri-ga       hóos-tììsa
            house-the underneath-its
            'underneath the house' lit. 'the house its underneath'
            (cf. hóos NF 'underneath')
(112)       gúriga hórtìisa
            gúri-ga        hór-tìisa
            house-the front-its
            'in front of the house' lit. 'the house its front' (cf. hór NF 'front')In these constructions both elements are noun phrases. Such nouns of location,
ág N F 'near(ness)', dhéx N F 'middle, centre', hóos N F 'underneath', hór N F
'front', etc. may also function as adverbs: occurring immediately before the verb
in the verbal group to modify the meaning of the head verb, for example:(113)    biyaha      wasakhda ah laga          dhex helaa         [BCH      25.11-12]
         water-the dirt-the      is one-in middle finds
         'one finds (them) within dirty water'
4.6     DeterminersThe determiners are a class of elements that are suffixed to nouns. There are
four types: definite articles, demonstratives, interrogatives and possessives.
Each type has a masculine form beginning with k- and a feminine form beginning
with t- to agree with the head noun's gender. The determiners do not show
plural agreement with the head noun. Their initial consonants undergo various
sandhi processes when attached to nominal stems, as described in 3.2.1. Many
 112                                    SOMALI
of the determiners can stand alone as verbal arguments like a kind of
pronominal, as we shall see.","[125, 126, 127]"
"6.2.1 Nouns modified by determiners
Each of the determiners described in 4.6 may modify nouns and occur as
suffixed clitics, for example with gèed Ν Μ 'tree' and mindi N F 'knife':(43)   Definite articles:    gèedka          'the tree (non-remote)'
                             gèedkíi         'the tree (remote)'
                             mindída         'the knife (non-remote)'
                             mindídii        'the knife (remote)'
(44)   Demonstratives:       gèedkán         'this tree'
                             mindidán        'this knife'
                             gèedkáa(s)     'that tree' (further away from speaker)
                             mindídáa(s)    'that knife'
                             gèedkéer       'that tree' (in the middle distance)
                             mindídéer      'that knife' ""
                             gèedkóo        'that tree' (in the far distance)
                             mindídóo       'that knife'
(45)   Interrogatives:       gèedkée        'which tree?'
                             mindídée       'which knife?'
(46)   Possessives:          gèedkàyga      'my tree'
                             gèedkàaga      'your tree', etc.
                             mindidàyda     'my knife'
                             mindídàada     'your knife', etc     As we noted in chapter 4, the possessives in (46) occur with the definite
article: nouns for family members, body parts and by extension, close friends
                                     PHRASES                                 175
occur without this final article, e.g. aabbáháy 'my father'. When combinations
of determiners on a noun occur they are always in the following order:(47)
                 Noun      +    possessive        +6.2.2 Nouns modified by nominals: possessive noun phrases
Noun phrases expressing possession occur in two types: the first, as we saw in
the last section, involves the use of a special possessive determiner on the
possessed noun. The order of nominals is possessor - possessed:(46)    Cáli         gúrigìisa
        Ali:ABS      house-his-the:ABS
        'Ali's house' (lit. '1і his house')Note that in the unmarked case both nominals occur in absolutive case. The
second type of possessive noun phrase shows the order possessed - possessor,
for example:(49) gúriga Calí
house-the:ABS Ali:GEN
        'Ali's house' (lit. 'the house of Ali')Here in the unmarked case the possessed nominal occurs in the absolutive case
while the possessor occurs in the genitive. In typical expressions of possession
either construction is possible: we assume that the choice is influenced by the
information structure requirements of the discourse context, for example what
the current topic is, or which elements the speaker wishes to foreground.
        Each possessive construction also occurs in extended uses where they
are not interchangeable. For example, as mentioned in 4.1.2, the genitive
construction is used in genealogies and by extension in the form of proper
names:(50) Xásan Calí
Hasan:ABS Ali:GEN
       'Hasan child of Ali' (lit. 'Hasan of Ali')The possessive determiner construction is not used in this way in names.
176                                     SOMALI
      Another important use of the genitive construction is when numerals are
used to count nouns, for example:(51)       labá       meelóod
        two:F:ABS     place:F:PL:GEN
        'two places' (lit. 'two of places')Here the numeral is the head of the construction and the counted noun is
dependent: the whole noun phrase has the gender of the numeral and the
numeral will attract any determiners: see for example the following feminine
noun phrase:(52) labáda і
        two-the:F:ABS man:M:SG:GEN
        'the two men' (lit. ' the two of man')These two examples also show a distinction in the behaviour of the counted
noun: all nouns except declension 1 occur in a singular form after all numerals,
as in (52), while declension 1 nouns occur in plural genitive forms after
numerals greater than one, as in (51). This genitive construction also occurs
with some other quantifying nouns, for example immisa 'how many', méeqa
'how many?' and dhawr 'several', for example:(53)     dhàwr          nín
        several:ABS man:SG:GEN
'several men' (lit. 'several of man')       As described in 4.6.4, the possessive determiner construction has
extended uses in expressing partitive quantification, as in (54), and spatial and
temporal location, as in (55):(54)    (a)   dádka           sáddexdóod
              people-the       three-their
               'three of the people'
        (b)   dádka           gíddigóod
              people-the       all-their'
              'all of the people'
(55)    (a)   mìiska        hóostìisa
              table-the underneath-its
              'underneath the table'

        (b)   habeennimáda hórtèeda
              nightfall-the      front-its-the
              'before nightfall' (lit. 'nightfall its front')6.2.3 Other modifiers
Nouns and noun phrases may also be modified by the following dependent
items.","[189, 190, 191, 192]"
"
4.1   NounsWe can identify four main types ofnoun: common nouns (CN), names or proper
nouns (NAM), independent pronouns (IPRO), and numerals (NUM). The defining
grammatical characteristics of nouns are that they are marked for case and that
they occur as subjects ofverbs, governing agreement features on the verb. They
may act as the heads of noun phrases, which share these characteristics, as
discussed in chapter 6. These main types or subcategories also have
characteristics which distinguish between them, as we shall see; for example, in
the modifiers that they allow. Common nouns and numerals, for example, occur
with determiners and restrictive relative clauses, while proper nouns and
independent pronouns normally do not. We begin our description with common
nouns.",[69]
"We can briefly discuss each of these characteristics. Firstly, the range of
sentence types found in main clauses (interrogative, imperative, optative, etc.)
does not occur in subordinate clauses. The latter have a single type that most
closely resembles declarative main clauses, except that the declarative marker
waa does not occur. Indeed sentence type markers (STMs) do not occur at all in
subordinate clauses. Thus, as we saw in the last chapter, there are no
subordinate interrogative clauses, or 'indirect questions', in Somali. The
function of these is performed by relative clauses on non-interrogative nouns of
time, place, manner, etc., for example:(2)    Weydii        hálkuu        tégayó!
      ask:IMP        place-the+he is:going
       'Ask him where he is going!' (lit. 'Ask him the place to which he is going')
(3)   Má        garáneyó      inta    nín       hálkáa       kú dhimatáy.
      not know:NEG amount-the man place-that in died
       ' I don't know how many men died there.'
      (lit. ' I don't know the amount of men that died in that place')     Secondly, as described in chapter 7, the focus markers bàa, ayàa and
wáxa(ä) do not occur within subordinate clauses, though the whole clause may
210                                  SOMALI
be focused. Hence, for example, no NP within a subordinate clause may be
focused.
       Thirdly, as we saw in chapter 4, subordinate clause verbs are distinguished
from main clause equivalents by a combination of accentual pattern and
inflection. This is further emphasised when subordinate clauses are case marked
for their grammatical fonction within the larger sentence.87 In addition to these
main features other differences occur: for example the negative word má 'not'
does not occur in subordinate clauses, always being replaced by aan 'not'.
Also, as we shall see, clauses acting as complements of certain verbs, like dòon
'wish, want', have a restricted range of tense and aspectual differences.
       One striking feature of the system of subordinate clauses is the important
role of relative clauses. Indeed it is possible to see all subordination as relative
clause formation, though in some cases the head elements have been
delexicalized and are no longer foll nouns. In most cases though their historical
relationship to nominals is clear. Because of this we begin with relative clauses
proper in 8.1 and 8.2 before moving on to other kinds of subordinate clauses.","[224, 225]"
"
4.5      Verbal appositionsIn Somali as in other closely related languages like Boni, Rendille, Elmolo,
Dasenach (Appleyard 1990) and Arbore (Hayward 1984)36 there are pre-verbal
morphemes which semantically govern oblique elements of the predication much
in the way that nominal adpositions do in other languages. In fact these
elements functionally parallel nominal postpositions and oblique case suffixes in
less closely related Cushitic languages like Oromo (Owens 1985). The four
morphemes are given below with their main meanings:         ú    'to, for'
         kú   'in, into, on, at, with (by means of)'
         ká   'from, away from, out o f
         lá   'with (in company with)'As we can see, the English glosses are prepositions and these pre-verbal
morphemes serve very similar functions. These include marking nominals as
having the semantic roles of location (102) & (103), source (104), goal (105),
beneficiary (106), instrument (107), manner (108) and comitative (109), where
the morphemes and relevant governed nominals are underlined:(102)     Wúxuukáshaqeeyaa warshádda.
          Wáxa+uu ká shaqeeyaa warshád-da
         what+he      at works          factory-the
          'He works at the factory. Where he works is at the factory.'

         'One saw him in the town. He was seen in the town.'

         nin-kán     bàa Cadán ká yimi
         man-this FOC Aden from came
         'This man came from Aden.'
(105)    Yáy ú tagtay?
         Yàa+ay      ú    tagtay
         who+she to        went

            who+FOC+you           with stayed:2SG
            'Who did you stay with?'","[124, 125]"
"
        Approximate numerals are formed by adding to numerals either the
suffix -éeyo to form feminine nouns, or the suffix -éeye to form masculine
nouns:(42)   tobanéeyo        F      'about ten, ten or so'
       labaatanéeyo     F      'about twenty'
       afartarnéeye     M      'about forty'
       kontoméeye       M      'about fifty'
       When used with nouns, the cardinal numerals act as the head of the
construction and the counted noun occurs in the genitive case, for example:(43)   afar         naagóod
       four: ABS    women: GEN
       'four women' (lit. 'four of women')
                          G R A M M A T I C A L CATEGORIES                                71This construction also occurs w i t h composite numerals like lahà              hoqól   'two
hundred' where lahá ' t w o ' is a feminine noun in absolutive case and                 hoqól
'hundred' is a masculine noun in genitive case.         Since lahà is head, the w h o l e
nominal is feminine.
          I n such constructions nouns o f declension 1 occur in plural genitive
forms after numerals greater than one, as in (43) above and (44) below, w h i l e all
other nouns occur in the singular genitive f o r m after all numerals (45):(44)     sàddex gabdhóod           'three girls'     cf. gabdhó M PL        'girls'
         toddobà maalmóod          'seven days'      cf. maalmó M PL        'days'
(45)     sàddex will               'three boys'      cf. wìil M SG          'boy'
         toddobá kaabúur           'seven trucks'    cf. baabúur M SG       'truck'
Thus sàddex wíil is literally 'three o f b o y ' .
         W h e n such constructions are made definite, it is the head numeral w h i c h
attracts the determiner; in the f o l l o w i n g examples the determiners are feminine
to match the head o f the N P , despite the counted noun being masculine. The
numeral N P s b e l o w w i l l o f course take feminine agreement w i t h a main sentence
verb.(46)     (a)      labádíi waraabé       (cf. waráabe M SG 'hyena')
                 labà-tíi                   waraabé
                 two:F:ABS-the:REM         hyena:SG:GEN
                  'the two hyenas (remote)'
         (b)     sáddexdáas nin         (cf. nin M SG 'man')
                 sâddex-tâas              nin
                 three:F:ABS-those    man:SG:GEN
                 'those three men'
         (c)     sáddexdàydíi adéer     (cf. adéer M SG 'paternal uncle')
                 sàddex-tày-tii         adéer
                 three:F:ABS-the-my     uncle:SG:GEN
                 'my three paternal uncles'
Nouns occur in these dependent genitive forms after several other quantifying
nouns like dháwr    'several', immisa ' h o w many?, méeqa ' h o w many?
        The ordinal numerals are formed f r o m cardinal numerals by the addition o f
a suffix -áad, w h i c h may produce the environment f o r Stem Contraction (3.1.4),
for example:
(47)            kowáad                'first'
                afráad                'fourth'

                kumáad             'thousandth'These ordinal numerals are not nouns: they modify and follow the counted
noun, which acts as head of the construction and thus attracts determiners,
percolates its gender to the whole NP, etc:
(48)      nín       saddexàad         'a third man'
                nínkíi saddexàad      'the third man'
4.2    Clitic PronounsClitic pronouns form a separate category, which unlike independent pronouns
do not exhibit the morpho-syntax of nouns. Clitic pronouns can only occur with
a verb and must occur in the strict sequence of clitic elements in the verbal
group described in chapter 6. They form two main sets, subject and object
pronouns, and also include the impersonal subject pronoun la 'one' and the
reflexive and reciprocal pronoun is 'self, each other'.","[85, 86, 87]"
"
8.1   Restrictive relative clauses8.1.1 Basic featuresRestrictive relative clauses are used to help identification of the head noun from
a larger set.88 In the terminology of Keenan (1985), Somali restrictive relative
clauses are post-nominal external relatives with the relativised position in the
clause marked by a gap. See for example sentence (4a) below, which contains
the head nominal and modifying relative clause (4b):(4)    (a)     Nínka     taló   xún taliyaa dhaxálkèeda ayùu              helaa.
               man-the advice bad advises legacy-its            FOC+he finds
               'The man who gives bad advice receives its legacy.' (Proverb)
       (b)     ninka     taló    xún taliyaa
               man-the advice bad advises
               'the man who gives bad advice'In (4b) the head noun is nín 'man' which attracts the determiner -ka 'the' and
occurs before the relative clause. There is no relative pronoun in the clause.
The head nominal always precedes the clause whatever position in the clause is
relativised.
       The relative clause resembles a main clause in syntax except that the
tendency for verb final order is much stronger. In addition certain elements such

aan ' n o t ' in (6) are attracted t o the head nominal and thus move away f r o m the
verbal group, for example:(5)      meeshuu        awal sadcaalka      ka      bilaabay

Where the head NP ends in a v o w e l these elements may coalesce onto the head
in the same way as w i t h the focus w o r d báa, described in 3.1.2, f o r example:(7)      Wáxaanád            ahayni     ku     má      qabtàan.

(8), direct object in (9), and oblique arguments in (10) and (11):

        'the diseases which are dangerous and which people die from' [BCH 25.32]
       I f the head nominal is complex, for example consisting o f a genitive or
possessive construction, or a numeral f o l l o w e d by a dependent noun (6.2.2),
relative clauses must be introduced by a conjunction: 8 9(14)    boqorkii     Bortaqiiska      magaciisa la        oran    jirey Maanwel

        poem') [S6 15.19-20]
8.1.2 Case    markingThe head nominal and its dependent clause act as a constituent, a noun phrase.
Consequently, given the phrase final nature o f case marking, the head nominal
never receives main clause case marking and always occurs in the default
absolutive case. The relative clause verb, as the final element o f the phrase,
carries the formal case marking. For example in (16a) b e l o w the head nominal
ninkíi 'the man' is object o f the adposition lá ' w i t h ' and the accentual marking
o f absolutive case applies t o the relative clause verb raacèen.   I n (16b) the head
is subject o f the main clause and consequently subject m a r k i n g applies to the
verb, lowering its accentual pattern to raaceen, as described in 4.3.4.13.
(16)    (a)    Ninkii    ay      raacèen         ma      lá   hadas hay?
               man-the they      accompanied     QM      with talked:2SG
               'Did you talk to the man they travelled with?'
        (b)    Ninkii    ay      raaceen         wáa ayó?
               man-the they      accompanied     DM who
               'The man they travelled with is who?'","[225, 226, 227]"
"4.1.1.2 Number
As with other Cushitic languages, the number system in Somali nouns is quite
complicated. Firstly there are a number of categories of number and secondly
the morphological marking of plural, where applicable, has a number of
exponents. We can begin by dividing common nouns into four number types:
countable, mass, collective and transnumeral.
       Countable nouns form the majority. When used unmodified they refer to
an individual entity, for example: kòob 'a cup', maalin 'a day'. They can be
counted directly by being used after a numeral, for example labá kóob 'two
cups', áfar maalmóod 'four days'. As described in 4.1.4., these are genitive
constructions where the numeral is the head and the counted noun occurs in the
genitive case, in some instances in the singular and in others in the plural, as we
                       GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                   57
shall see. Countable nouns otherwise regularly occur in plural forms, e.g.
koobáb 'cups', maalmó 'days'.
       Mass nouns form a smaller group which do not refer to individuals but
name a substance or material, for example: biyó 'water', búr 'flour', caanó
'milk', saliid 'oil', shàah 'tea', sonkor 'sugar', súbag 'clarified butter', timó
'hair'. These nouns can only be counted indirectly by using a relevant unit of
measurement, for example:(10) labá kóob 00 shàah áh
        labá        kóob         00     shàah       áh
        two-ABS      cup:GEN and        tea:ABS     be
      'Two cups oftea' (lit. 'Two ofcup and which are tea')Mass nouns do not normally display a singular/plural distinction but the class is
divided into nouns which always occur with singular verbal agreement and those
with plural verbal agreement; for example, the two masculine nouns shàah 'tea'
and caanó 'milk', respectively:(11) Mass noun, singular agreement
      Shàahii wùu qubtay.
      shàah-kii     wàa+uu                qubtay
      tea-the       DM+CPRO:3SGM          spilled:3SG M
      'Thetea spilled.'
(12) Mass noun, plural agreement
      Caanihii way qubteen.
      caanó-kiì     wàa+ay               qubteen
      milk-tl1e     DM+CPRO:3PL          spilled:3PL
      The milk spilled/Since the mass nouns which take plural agreement all end in final -ό (caanó,
biyó, etc.), and since this is, as we shall see, a common plural suffix, we can
suggest a possible explanation for this agreement pattern. These represent
plural forms historically which no longer have a singular form, i.e. what are
sometimes called plurale tantum forms.
       Collective nouns are another restricted group of nouns, which are used to
refer to sets ofindividuals. They can identify either the usually experienced set,
for example gèel 'herd ofcamels' or the universal set, e.g. rag 'men, mankind'.
Ifthe context allows either interpretation is possible, so that gèel can mean ' a
herd ofcamels' or be used generically for 'camels'. Other examples include:
adhi '(herd of) goats and sheep, carrúur 'children', dad 'people', dúmar
'women, womankind', habló 'girls', idó '(flock of) sheep', ilmo 'children', / o '
58                                       SOMALI
'cattle', xοοlό 'livestock'. As with mass nouns, collectives cannot be counted
directly, but can be counted indirectly using a relative clause on a head numeral,
for example:(13)    Saddex carriiur              ah
        three      children:ABS are
        'three children' (lit.: 'three who are children')Collectives do not normally show a singular/plural distinction but as with mass
nouns, forms ending in -ό always take plural agreement:(14)    Collective noun, plural agreement
        Hablihii wàyyimaadeen.
        hablo-kii     wàa+ay            yìmaadeen
        girls-the     DM+CPRO:3PL came:3PL
        'The girls came'Speakers do sometimes pluralize collectives when the set referred to is smaller
than the universal set. Thus for example, one can hear geelal 'herds of camels'
fromgèel '(herd of) camels'.
       Transnumeral nouns, to use the term introduced by Serzisko (1992), are a
small group of nouns which can be used with the semantic force of any of the
categories described so far. Thus kalliiun 'fish' can be used to refer to an
individual fish, or the substance, or a collective, so that the nominal kalluunkan
{<r-halluun - kán 'this') can be used for 'this (one) fish', 'this fish meat', or 'this
group of fish'. Other examples include: heed 'egg', cambe 'mango', liin
'orange, lemon', muus 'banana', sigaar 'cigarette(s)', ukiin 'egg'.
Transnumeral nouns cannot be counted directly by numerals; they require the
use ofa relative clause with as its head a numeral or a unit ofmeasure:(15)   xabbad liin        ah
       unit     orange be
       'one orange' (lit.: 'a unit that is orange')
(16)   laba     liin      ah
       two      orange be
       'two oranges' (lit.: 'two which are orange(s)')As we have noted, of these types of common noun, only countable nouns
regularly form plurals. Plurals are formed by a range of morphological
operations which we describe in the next section when we discuss declensions of
                          GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                59
countable nouns. We postpone discussion ofcase to section 4.1.1.4, since the
noun declensions are helpful in discussing case marking.","[71, 72, 73, 74]"
"Discussing these and similar problems I argued in Saeed (1984) that there is no
 overt verb focus word in Somali and that waa should be viewed, like the
question word ma, as merely consistent with verb focus. In this approach waa,
like the question word ma, and the optative word há, is analysed as a sentence
type marker (STM), in this case identifying positive declarative sentences. This
has the advantage that it explains why waa is replaced by other markers in other
sentence types, and by the negative word ma in negative declaratives.104
       Of course in this approach we must explain why waa does not occur with
bàalayàa and waxa{a) in positive declaratives with focus. We might take note
here of Ajello's (1995) observation that focus can be viewed as part of the
modality system in Somali. He suggests that nominal focus asserts the existence
of the referent: ""In altre parole, anche quando la focalizzazione verte su un
sintagma nominale, essa rappresenta l'asserzione che un tale sintagma nominale
non è virtuale, ipotetico, ma reale e che esso ha un certo ruolo all'interno della
predicazione principale."" (Ajello 1995: 16). Waa sentences on the other hand
involve the assertion of the whole predication. This identification of a functional
contrast may help explain the complementary distribution of the
constructions.1059.1.4 Word order and topicsAs we have seen, the description of word order, or more properly constituent
order, has to make reference to both syntactic status and information structure.
Inside phrases the order of elements is generally fixed, and the constituents of
verbal groups (6.1) and noun phrases (6.2) can be described by templates. The
relative order of noun phrases and verbal groups, however, is dependent on
information structure. It is possible to discern an underlying preference for the
verb final clause structure described for other Cushitic languages. One piece of
evidence is the rigid order of subject-object-verb we find in clitic pronouns in
the VGP (6.1.1). Another is the fact that the basic focus strategy, bàalayàa
focus, requires focused elements to occur before the verb. Speakers must use a
wáxa(a) cleft to position focused elements after the verb. This is related to a
further significant feature: the tendency for post-verbal NPs to be known and
activated. Indeed it is reasonable to view post-verbal NPs, other than in clefts,
as afterthought topics. As Gebert (1986) points out, in an all-new context
provided by a question like (39a) below, reply (39c) is inappropriate:
                                  DISCOURSE                                  241
(39)     (a)      Maxàa       dhacáy?
                  what+FOC happened
                  'What happened?'
         (b)      Càli bàa Maryám diláy.
                  Ali     FOC Mariam hit
                  'ALI hit Mariam'
         (c)    #Cáli    bàa diláy Maryám.
                  Ali FOC hit       Mariam
                  'ALI hit Mariam'The nominal Maryam can appropriately be new in (39b) but not in (39c).
      This observation needs qualification, however, since there are a number of
cases where this tendency does not hold. Adverbial expressions for example can
occur post-verbally even when new. Gebert (1986) provides the following
examples:(40)   (a)      Maxaa dhacay?
                'What happened?'
       (b)      #Cali baa dilay Maryam.
                Ali      FOC hit       Maryam
                'ALI hit Maryam.'
       (c)      Cali baa dhintay shaley.
                Ali FOC died           yesterday
                'ALI died yesterday. 'Here the adverbial shaley 'yesterday' but not the object Maryam is appropriate
as new information in post-verbal position. Similarly, locative NPs governed by
verbal adpositions may occur post-verbally when new; to use Gebert's examples
again:(41)   (a)       Wax cusubi ma jiraan?
                thing new       QM are
                 'What's the news?'
       (b)     #Cali    baa tegay Marka.
                Ali     FOC went-to Marka
                'ALI has gone to Marka. '
       (c)      Cali baa ku dhintay Marka.
                Ali    FOC in died        Marka
                'ALI has died in Marka. '
242                                 SOMALI
Representing new information in (41), the town name Marka is appropriate
post-verbally when governed by the adposition kú 'in' but not when it is an
argument of the verb tág 'go to'.
      Interestingly this seems to be more dependent upon the function role of
the governed nominal than the simple syntactic fact of government by an
adposition, since in the following exchange (42c) is less appropriate than (42b):(42)    (a)      Wáx cusubi má jiraan?
                thing new       QM are
                'What's the news?'
        (b)     Cáli bàa gabádh lá baxáy
                Ali    FOC girl         with went
                'ALI has eloped with a girl'
        (c)     #Cáli bàa lá             baxáy gabádh.
                Ali      FOC with went          girl

"Once again word syllable structures will produce various realisations of this AP
and some neutralisations: for example, words with two short syllables will not
distinguish AP1 and AP4, and ofcourse short monosyllables may collapse AP1,
AP2 and AP4.
       Although there are exceptions (4.1.1.4), the typical pattern of case
marking is for the inherent absolutive case AP of a noun to be changed in the
other cases as follows:(66)             Nominative (NOM)        Genitive (GEN)           Vocative (VOC)

              (←*carruur)              (←*carruur)Accentual patterns are also sensitive to, and markers of, other kinds of syntactic
information. To take one example, verbs whose subjects are focused are marked
by a distinct pattern: they have a HIGH tone on their final mora. Compare for
example the forms of arkay 'saw' in the following:

"The specific type of third person has to be recovered from context. Note that
for economy we have not given an English gloss for all the third person options
in each example in this book, simply giving whichever pronoun seems likeliest in
context, or in some cases writing 'him etc.', 'her etc.' and so on. One effect of
this use of a gap is that the argument structure of a verb is always filled: it is not
possible in Somali to remove an argument from a verb simply by omitting it as in
the English pair He ate lunch/He ate. In Somali omitting an overt NP will
trigger a third person object pronoun interpretation as in (54a); to express the

      After years of heated debate about choosing between Roman, Arabic and
indigenous orthographies, a Roman orthography was adopted for Somali in the
Somali Republic in 1972 and Somali was adopted as the official language ofthe
4                                   SOMALI
 state. Great strides were made in the development of literacy and the
 introduction of Somali as the medium of government, education and mass
 media. Arabic was adopted as the second language ofthe state. At this level of
 official state languages, Somali thus joined its neighbours Amharic in Ethiopia
 and Swahili in Kenya, making this region one of the most important in the
 development of African languages as official media. Though the development
 of Somali as an official language has been halted by the recent civil wars, it
 continues to be the written medium in all parts ofthe Somali-speaking Horn and
 among and between expatriate communities abroad. Andrzejewski (1974,
 1978) and Laitin (1977) give descriptions ofthe Somali experience oflanguage
 planning.
        Somali shows considerable dialect variation. There are three main dialect
 groups, Northern, Benadir and May. The Northern dialect group is the most
 geographically widespread of these; indeed this is a somewhat misleading term
 since, because of clan migrations, this dialect group is spoken in a broad sweep
 across the northern, western and southernmost parts of the Somali-speaking
 area. This dialect seems to have been used as a lingua franca amongst other
 dialects. It enjoys the most prestige, not least because it has been the dialect
used by the greatest Somali poets and by the various political élites since the
formation ofthe Somali state. Not surprising then this dialect formed the basis
 of the standard used for official purposes in the Somali Republic. Because of
this some writers have called this dialect Common Somali. It is this dialect that
forms the subject ofthis book, though we will use the term StandardSomali.4 A
 second large group is formed by the Benadir (Benaadir) dialects spoken along
and behind the central Indian Ocean coast, including Mogadishu. There is a fair
degree of inter-comprehensibility between Benadir dialects and Standard
 Somali. The third major dialect group consists of the May (Maay) dialects
spoken in a broad band of southern Somalia stretching from almost the
Ethiopian border to just short of the coastal strip between Mogadishu and
Kismayo. The largest urban centre in this dialect area is Baydhaba (Baidoa).
The May dialect group shows considerable differences from Standard and
Benadir dialects at all levels and these latter two groups and May are mutually
incomprehensible. Because of the role and status given to Standard Somali
many May speakers are able to use it as a lingua franca. There has been little
use of May dialects in education, official media, or publishing. In addition to
these main groups there are a number of smaller, more localised dialects in the
southern inter-riverine region and in the southern coastal towns. These include
the Jiddu (Jiiddu) dialect (Moreno 1951); the Tunni dialect spoken in the coastal
region around Brava (Tosco 1997); the Karre dialect of Qoryooley (Tosco
1989); and the Ashrafdialects ofMogadishu and Merka (Moreno 1953).5

     The overall picture of the dialects contrasts the relative homogeneity of
Standard Somali over its vast range with the much greater dialectal variation in
the more sedentary areas of the southern riverine regions and around the
southern ports ofMogadishu, Merka, Brava and Kismayo.6
1.3   Linguistic studies Although Somali is possibly the best documented and most studied Cushitic
 language, in many areas the linguistic description is still very sketchy. Perhaps
the most developed area is lexicology. Here there exists a major Somali-Italian
 dictionary ofmore than forty thousand entries (Agostini et al. eds. 1985), with a
related thirty-five thousand-entry Italian-Somali dictionary (Puglielli ed. 1998).
 There is also a twenty-six thousand-entry Somali-English dictionary (Zorc and
 Osman eds. 1993), a substantial Somali-French-Somali dictionary (Maxamed
 1986) and a monolingual Somali dictionary (Keenadiid 1976). In the area of
grammar, there are relatively recent concise reference grammars in English
(Saeed 1993a), and in German (Lamberti 1988), as well as older studies in
Italian (Moreno 1955, Panza 1974), and Russian (Zholkovskij 1971). A series of
grammatical studies, Studi Somali, has been published by the Italian
Government's Dipartimento per la cooperazione allo svilippo (see for example
Cardona and Agostini ed. 1981, Puglielli ed. 1981, Puglielli ed. 1984). Teaching
handbooks have been published in English (Zorc and Issa 1990, Orwin 1995),
German (El-Solami-Mewis 1987) and French (Abdullahi 1996). Perhaps the
weakest areas are in phonetics and phonology where there is still no book-length
study published 7, and perhaps less surprisingly, in pragmatics and discourse,
though Biber (1995) includes Somali in a study ofregister variation.
       If we move from books to academic articles and papers there has been a
steady increase in the number of linguistic studies published. There is notably a
three-yearly congress held by the Somali Studies International Association
whose Proceedings (e.g. Labahn ed. 1984) contain many linguistic papers.
Finally any survey, however brief, must acknowledge the groundbreaking series
of Somali grammatical studies published by the late B.W. Andrzejewski; for a
bibliography see Hayward and Lewis (eds. 1996).","[18, 19, 20]"
"4.3.6.7 Potential
This paradigm has the same uses as with other verbs, e.g. Show nácas ahaadee,
'Perhaps he is a fool'. The forms are:         1SG/3SGM             ahaadee
         2SG/3SGF             ahaatee
         1PL                  ahaannee
         2PL                  ahaateen
         3PL                  ahaadeen4.3.6.8 Subordinate clause forms
There is no distinction between main and subordinate clause forms of yahay
except for relative clauses, where the verb shows a reduced agreement pattern
or restrictive form, as described in 4.3.4.13, when agreeing with the relative
clause subject. The restrictive form of the present general is the invariable form
á(h) and the forms of the past simple are given below:         1SG/2SG /3SG M/2PL /3PL         aháa
         3SGF                            aháyd
         1PL                             aháyn
These are the absolutive case forms which occur when the relative clause is not
subject of the main clause; when the clause is subject, all high tones will be
lowered and the present general form a(h) will carry the nominative suffix -i,
becoming ihi by vowel assimilation.
104                                  SOMALI4.4    AdjectivesAdjectives as a class are characterised by occurring attributively as post-nominal
modifiers, as in (94) below, and predicatively as complements o f the copula
yahay, as in (95). They are differentiated from nouns in the following ways.
They do not occur with suffixed determiners, they do not have inherent number
and gender, and when they do occur as complements o f yahay, unlike nouns,
they are positioned between the satellite clitics and the verb (6.1.4), as we shall
see. They are unlike verbs in that they occur as complements of yahay, which
does not function as an auxiliary verb. In addition, as described in 3.5,
adjectives may mark plural agreement with a nominal head by reduplication,
which does not occur with this function in verbs.(94)    (a)    náag       dhèer
               woman tall
               'a tall woman'
       (b)     méel       fóg
               place      distant
               'a distant place'
(95)   (a)     Wuu yár yahay
               waa+uu      yár      yahay
               DM+he        small   is
               'He is small'
       (b)     Way yaryár yihiin
               waa+ay      yaryár    yihiin
               DM+they     small     are
               'They are small'
In (95) the adjective yår occurs between the subject clitic pronouns uu and ay
and the verb yahay; neither nouns nor verbs may occur thus in this construction.
In (95b) we see the plural marked by reduplication.
      In predicative uses adjectives coalesce with the copula yahay. When the
copula stem begins with the prefixed agreement markers, as in present general
forms, this is a stylistic optional rule, as for the adjective wanaagsân 'good' in
(96) below. However, when the copula stem begins with aA-, as in the past
simple, this coalescence is obligatory, as in (97) and (98):(96)   (a)     Wuu wanaagsân yahay
               waa+uu       wanaagsân yahay
               DM+he        good      is
               cHe is good'

        (b)      Wuu wanaagsànyay
                 'He is good'
(97)    (a)      *Wuu wanaagsán ahaa
                waa+u n       wanaagsán ahaa
                DM+he         good      was
                'He was good""
        (b)   Wùu wanaagsanaa
                'He was good'
(98)    (a)      *ninkii wanaagsàn aháa
               nin-kii       wanaagsán ahaa
                man-the      good        was
                'the man who was good'
       (b)     nínkíi wanaagsanáa
                'the man who was good'As can be seen, both the optional and obligatory coalescence rules delete the
segment ah from the copula and cliticize the remnant onto the adjective stem.
This has led some writers, for example Andrzejewski (1969) and Banti (1994),
to recognize these coalesced predicative adjectives as a form of verb,
presumably under the formal criterion that they bear (yahay''s) inflection and
also perhaps from the understandable reluctance to posit a synchronic obligatory
coalescence rule. I f recognised as such, they form an unusual type of verb, or a
category that flips between adjective and verb depending on context, perhaps
reflecting an ongoing historical process, hence Andrzejewski's (1969) term
'hybrid verb'; see Saeed (1988) and Banti (1994) for further discussion. The
attributive and predicative uses of adjectives are discussed further in chapter 6.","[118, 119, 120]"

      introductions to Somali culture and poetry, see Loughran et al. (eds. 1986) and
      Andrzejewski and Andrzejewski (1993).
 2.   For characteristic accounts, very different in kind, see Burton (1894), and Laurence
      (1954, 1963).
 3.   Zorc and Osman (1993), for example, list around seventeen hundred Arabic loans in
      their twenty six thousand-entry Somali-English dictionary.
 4.   There are some relatively minor regional variations within the Northern dialect, or
      Standard Somali, and this study is largely based on the speech of speakers from the
      north-western part of its range, near the towns of Hargeysa and Burco (Burao). It is
      clear from published materials that the Standard Somali used in Mogadishu during the
      Somali Democratic Republic (i.e. until 1990) was influenced by the local Benadir
      dialects. It seems likely that without the political upheaval a Northern-Benadir koine
      might have formed the future standard variety, at least in the south.
 5.   See Lamberti (1986a, 1986b) for a proposed classification of these dialects.
6.    For description of Benadir and other southern dialects, see Moreno (1955). May
      dialects are described in von Tiling (1922, 1925) and Saeed (1982, 1992).
7.    Note though that Orwin (1994) is an unpublished PhD dissertation on aspects of Somali
      phonology.
8.    The use of accents to mark tone is discussed in detail in section 2.4. Briefly, three tones
      are marked: an acute accent marks High tone (); no mark is used for Low tone (a) and
      a grave accent marks Falling tone (à). Tones on long vowels and diphthongs are only
      marked on the first vowel, e.g. áa, àa.
9.    The last correspondence between northern dhdh and southern dh suggests that southern
      dialects represent a more extended version of the northern rule which weakens the
      retroflex plosive dh sound to a corresponding flap intervocalically. We may posit a
      process where both intervocalic and final dh became a flap which then collapsed with
268                                   SOMALI
       the alveolar trill r. Thus in positions where northern dialects have a double intervocalic
       consonant dhdh, the southern weakening process results in single dh rather than a flap
       and subsequent r. Note that in writing, speakers of the northern variety usually simplify
       a double dh dh to dh.
 10.    There are a few exceptions to this generalisation in loans from Arabic, for example
       fekrád N F 'idea', maktabád N F 'library', bikrád N F 'virgin'. Syllable final  sometimes
        also occurs in loans from other languages, e.g. mikroskòob N  'microscope' from
        English, though this is often pronounced mikoroskòob to avoid this.
 11.   Note that Orwin (1996: 61-5) discusses some complications in the phonological weight
       of diphthongs. In polysyllabic words with a final open diphthong, for example árdey (N
       M) 'student', the final diphthong is short for purposes of accent assignment though it
       may be counted as long or short in the metrical system. Closed syllable diphthongs in
       mono- and poly-syllabic words are always long. Note that the long diphthongs aay,
       aaw, etc. only occur in open syllables.
 12.   See Johnson (1979, 1984, 1996), Guuleed (1980), Andrzejewski (1982), Banti &
       Giannattasio (1996), and Orwin & Riiraash (1997) for discussions of poetic scansion;

       Somali literature.
 13.   Although sometimes a slight rising tone may be heard on these syllables.
 14.   This statement, wliich seems to have been true, may now need qualification. Younger
       Somali speakers, perhaps under the influence of foreign languages, seem to happily
       produce questions by intonation alone, i.e. turning the negative declarative Má yeelín,
       'You didn't accept it' into a question by giving it rising intonation, Má yeelín? 'Didn't
       you accept it?', unlike the more traditional strategy employing an interrogative sentence
       type marker, e.g. Miyàanád yeelín? 'Didn't you accept it?' See chapter 4 for discussion
       of sentence type markers and chapter 7 for negative questions.
15.    The choice of  and t as the base form of the initial consonant is suggested by the form
       of the sandln rules described in this section, but confirmed by their presence in
       independent non-suffixed forms where kalta, kíiltíi are used pronominally to mean 'the
       one' e.g. kíi kalé 'the other one ()', tíi kalé 'the other one (F)'
16.    With the one notable exception of the word gèel 'camel, camels' which deletes the
       initial k, i.e. gèela 'the camel, camels'.
17.    As mentioned earlier, dhdh is usually simplified to dh in print; so this nominal would
       appear as gabadha 'the girl'.
18.    Noun stems under discussion include noun roots like áabbe 'father', roots with plural -o
       suffixes like maalmo 'days' (cf. maalín 'day') and verbal roots nominalised by an
       agentive suffix like báre 'teacher' (cf. bár v 'teach').
19.    Which here undergo the same sandhi rules as other determiner suffixes, i.e. -kay →-hay
       and -tay → -day).
                                       NOTES                                                 26920.   One of the problems of Somali phonology is how to explain the various forms of these
      lexical affixes. This causative affix, for example, surfaces in most verbal forms as -i. In
      some derived nouns it is -is (e.g. jóoji V CAUS 'stop', jóojis N  'act of stopping
      something'). When occurring between a verb root and a middle affix it occurs as -s-, for
      example joogsaday '(I) stopped myself. This has the morphological structure: joog
      (root, 'stop') + s (causative affix) + at (middle affix) + ay (past simple inflection). One
      explanation which is based on historical and comparative evidence is that the affix was
      previously -*ish, which then developed into -i(y) and -is and -s forms in different
      environments. See Sasse (1979) and Lamberti (1986a) for detailed discussion.
21.    Once again this is an affix which has different forms: a basic form -at- (usually
       surfacing as -ad- or -/-, as will be described here), -ó in imperative singular forms, e.g.
      joogsó 'Stop yourself! Halt!', and -a- in the infinitive, e.g. joogsán 'to stop oneself',
       which has the morphological structure: joog (root, 'stop') + s (causative affix) + a
       (middle affix) + n (infinitive inflection).
22.   As here, a noun phrase focused by one of the focus words will be written in small
      capitals in the translation.
23.   One important exception is the noun phrase haddíi 'the occasion, time', which as
      described in 8.3.6, introduces conditional clauses. Subject verbal pronouns regularly
      coalesce with this nominal, for example haddàad tagtó 'if you go', although the
      uncoalesced form is also possible: haddii aad tagtó.
24.   See 7.4.1 for a discussion of the unusual tone pattern on báan here.
25.   The missing forms are because, as described in 4.1.1.4, there are several forms of
      vocatives. The vocative marked by AP change alone is normally used with names, while
      vocative forms with suffixes are used for both common nouns and names. Thus the
      predicted vocative forms by AP change alone, díbi, bisad and cárruur would normally
      not occur, being replaced by the suffixed forms dibiyohow (or díbiyòw), bisádyahay (or
      bisádèey) and carrúuryahay (or carrúurèey). Note though that the use of the different
      vocatives reflects a speaker's attitude and might vary for example between real life
      situations and when animals address each other in fables.
26.   The changes from Saeed (1993a) arise from following Banti's (1988b) analysis of the
      lowering and shifting of High tones. The consequences include recognising that most
      plural nouns and the irregular nouns of declension 2 have API inherently, which
      becomes AP3 in some contexts, rather than the other way around; and identifying
      declension 6 and 7 nouns as inherently API in the singular, becoming AP2 in some
      contexts.
27.   Note though that it is possible for the name suffixes to occur with Low rather than
      Falling tone, e.g. Xàsanow ratifier than Xásanòw. This seems to be an optional
      pronunciation.
28.   Adpositions, as described in 4.5, 6.1, and 6.3, also occur in the verbal group.
29.   Two points are perhaps relevant here: firstly some stative verbs do occur in imperatives,
      e.g. yahay 'be', described in 4.3.6. Secondly, stative root verbs may become dynamic
      when lexical affixes are attached. Thus the stative verb húb 'be certain', has a derived
270                                    SOMALI
       causative verb húbi 'make certain, ascertain' and a middle voice verb hub só 'make
       certain for one self, be certain of both of which are dynamic and may occur in
       imperatives.
 30.   Many writers have commented on the egalitarian nature of traditional Somali society,
       for example Lewis (1961). There has been little written on sociolinguistic topics like
       politeness, but it seems clear that the ready use of imperatives, along with the lack of
       polite pronouns, honorifics, etc. reflect the lack of social hierarchy felt amongst
       Somalis.
 31.   Though some speakers do form a negative auxiliary construction paralleling the positive
       forms. This consists of the infinitive followed by an invariable negative form of the
       auxiliary léh: e.g. má súgi laháyn 'I/you/he etc. would not wait for it'.
 32.   Distinguished from the negative imperative sentence type marker ha by its accentual
       pattern.
 33.   See for example the contrast between sentences (90) and (91) below.
 34.   See 8.1 for further details and examples.
 35.   This adjective also occurs as feejíg and foojíg, wliile some speakers use the associated
       derived adjectives feeyigán (feeyignaa),feejigán (feejignaa), foojigán (foojignaa).
 36.   These languages form, with Somali, the Omo-Tana subgroup of Eastern Cusliitic as
       shown in chapter 1.
 37.   But note that Central Somali dialects, which are quite distinct from the Standard Somali
       varieties described here, do have as described in Saeed (1982: 89-90) a singulative
       suffix ko/to which belongs to this set of determiners, e.g. náŋ 'man' náŋko 'a (single)
       man'.
38.    We assume that the accentual patterns (APs) on the possessives in (125) are the
       category's inherent APs. The absolutive and subject case markings are the phrasal
       exponents of nominal case marking. We will assume that possessives, unlike nouns, do
       not have as their default an absolutive case form because they are not nouns and
       therefore do not have inherent case.
39.    There is variation in the length of the final vowel of wáxa/wáxaa that has not yet been
       satisfactorily explained. It seems in part to be regional since in north-eastern varieties
       the short final vowel version often occurs while in southern varieties, as reported by
       Svolacchia and Puglielli (1995), it is rare.
40.    The difference between the two forms of negative question are discussed in chapter 7,
       where we also discuss the morphosyntactic structure of sentences like Miyaanú sugín?
       'Didn't he wait for it?' For now we treat miyàanú as a fusion of ma (QM) + áan ('not')
       + uu 'he'.
41.    The conjunctions oo and  are also used to mark distinctions between types of relative
       clauses, as discussed in chapter 8. Note that this distinction may not occur in this way in
       all dialects: the use of conjunctions has not been compared across dialects.
42.    This is from a jiifto by the poet and Dervish leader Maxamed Cabdille Xasan.
                                       NOTES                                                 27143.   As will be clear from the examples in this section, the meaning of these verbs is
      lexically weakened or generalised in ideophone constructions. The verb yidhi 'say', for
      example, takes as its object not only ideophones describing sounds but also those
      describing light and movement. As mentioned by Dhoore and Tosco (1998) the use of
      verbs meaning 'say' with ideophones is an areal feature of the Horn of Africa. Similarly
      sii 'give' is weakened to a general causative or factitive meaning. Compare this to the
      grammaticalisation of this verb as a causative affix, discussed in 5.1.5 below.
44.   Many of Dhoore and Tosco's (1998) examples in this category are of actions involved
      with ingestion, for example díg used to describe eating violently, or wolfing something
      down; daláq for swallowing something small, and julúq for swallowing without
      chewing. These might possibly be seen as subtypes of their first category, movement.
45.   Some speakers pronounce the imperative allomorph as aw rather than ow, e.g. adkàw
      'become hard'. This pronunciation makes these morphological conditioned exponents
      suspiciously like parts of the stem of yahay 'be', shown in bold in the following; for
      example the imperative ahaw!, the infinitive ahaan, and the forms found in optative,
      negative conditional, and optative paradigms, e.g. the potential ahaad-ee /ahaat-ee
      'perhaps he/she is'. We have already seen in 4.4 the similarity between forms of yahay
      beginning with ah- and inflection on adjectival stems; it is possible that this distribution
      of inchoative exponents is part of the same overlap.
46.   In some varieties of Standard Somali this affix occurs as oo in the imperative singular,
      e.g. dhaxamôo 'feel cold', gaajòo 'feel hungry', etc.
47.   The alternation a~e in these forms, ayn/eyn, ays/eys, seems at least in part the result of
      contextual assimilation rules but the details of the rule seem subject to regional variation
      within Standard Somali in ways that have not been described. We simply list the
      alternant forms here.
48.   The verb furmay in (b) is from *furamay by the rule of Stem Contraction (3.1.4).
49.   I am grateful to the late B.W. Andrzejewski for this form of the prayer. The suffix day,
      glossed EXCL, is a marker of exclamations.
50.   We mentioned in chapter 4 the difficulty in deciding on a reference form for this affix,
      whose principal forms are is, i, and s. On historical grounds, and for the best account of
      word derivation, as we shall see in the section on derived nouns (5.3.1), the form is
      seems more basic and we use this as the reference form here. It is, however, difficult to
      find good synchronic phonological motivation for all of the occurrences of the i and s
      variants. We leave this problem to future phonological studies.
51.   We assume that hindhisíisáy is phonologically derived from *hindhissíisáy because of
      the phonotactic constraint against geminate fricatives.
52.   The verb qadèe 'eat lunch' is formed from the noun qàdo F 'lunch' by the affix ays
      described later in this section.
53.   A perhaps obvious but important point is that the existence of this affix means that its
      absence from a verb also communicates meaning. Thus we can compare the meanings
      of the following root and middle verbs:
272                                     SOMALI

numeral is ków, which becomes kóob when followed by iyo 'and' as shown in

baabúur 'one truck'. When the numeral occurs alone as the argument of a verb,
it is replaced by mid 'one', e.g. mid kèenV 'Bring one!' This word mid is also
used in isolation when a verb is understood:(41)   Question :     Immisàad dóonaysaa ?

6.1   Verbal group (VGP)The verbal group is the core element of a clause and consists minimally of a verb
but may also include adpositions, clitic pronouns, adverbial clitics, and in
auxiliary verb constructions, a dependent verb. We use the term verbal group
rather than verb phrase since the latter is associated in languages like English
with a syntactic unit comprising a verb and its phrasal complements, particularly
noun phrases. As described in Saeed (1984) there is no syntactic evidence for
such a unit in Somali: noun phrase objects, for example, do not form a
constituent with the verb, nor occur in a fixed position relative to the verb, as
we shall see in chapter 7. The verbal group on the other hand may contain clitic
pronouns representing any argument of the verb, including subjects, and they
occur in a fixed position relative to the verb and other elements.
164                                       SOMALI6.1.1 The structure of the VGPThe verbal group is a head-final phrase with dependent elements occurring as
clitics preceding the head verb. Its structure may best be described by a
template:(1)   [VGP    S PRO -  PRO I - ADP - ADV I - ADV Π -  PRO Π -                  V ] 62The elements of the template are as follows, with the section of chapter 4 in
which they are described given in parentheses:(2)          Verbal Group elements
             S PRO:      subject clitic pronoun                       (4.2.1)

exceptions noted in 6.1.7 below. We can provide some examples of verbal

        (b)    [VGP S PRO -  PRO I - ADP - ADV - V - AUX]It is important to note that the above examples are not full sentences: they
require additional elements such as sentence type markers, focus words, etc. to
form sentences as described in chapter 7. One striking feature of the VGP is the
rigidity of its clitic ordering: not only must the different types of clitic occur in
the template order given in (1) above, but when more than one member of a
category occurs their relative order is also fixed. We can take as an example of
this the combinations of adpositions described in 3.3 earlier. In example (6)
above we find the combination iigá which is formed by coalescence from the
clitics і 'me' + ú 'for' + ká 'from'. In (6) we gloss this sequence as Tor me
from (him etc.)', i.e. with the pronoun і 'me' governed by the adposition ú 'for';
however this sequence can also be interpreted as 'for (him etc.) from me', i.e.
with / 'me' governed by ká 'from'. The order of clitics does not change to
reflect the two different patterns of semantic government. We may conclude
that the order of clitic elements in the VGP is not directly semantically
motivated.646.1.2 Clitic pronouns in the VGP
Both subject and object clitic pronouns occur in the VGP but they differ in their
behaviour. The occurrence of subject clitic pronouns is sensitive to the
information structure of the containing sentence. Compare sentences (8) and (9)
below, which show two important features of this sensitivity.(8)    (a)     Cali wùu         yimi.
               Ali      DM+he came
                'Ali came.'

               'ALI came, It was ALI who came.'
       (b)     *Cáli bùu        yimí
               Ali     FOC+he came
               'ALI came, It was ALI who came.'
166                                   SOMALI
The difference between these sentences is that in (9) the subject Ali is in focus,
shown by the focus word bàa.65 The two sentences exhibit several morpho-
syntactic differences, as we will discuss in chapter 7. For now we concentrate
on the subject clitic pronoun behaviour. Taking non-focus sentences first: when
the context makes the identity of the subject clear, as in the simple sentence (8),
the subject clitic is optional. In other words subject clitic 'doubling' is possible
and seems to be governed by referential recoverability. In focus sentences on
the other hand, the subject NP in focus cannot be doubled by a clitic in the VGP,
as the ungrammaticality of (9b) shows.
      If we turn to object clitic pronouns: they must obligatorily occur to fill the
argument positions of the verb (and any adpositions). See for example the non-
focus sentences below:(10)   (a)     Axmed      adíga wùu             ku       arkay.
               Ahmed      you (SG) DM+he        you      saw
               'Ahmed saw you.'
       (b)     *Axm.ed    adiga wùu             arkay.
               Ahmed      you (SG) DM+he        saw
               'Ahmed saw you.'","[178, 179, 180, 181]"
" 54.   Other colour terms are nouns which do not form adjectives, for example bèey N M 'ash
       greyness (of livestock)', ásfar N  'yellow gold', hurúud NF 'saffron, yellow'.
 55.   Puglielli (1984) proposes the following derivations for these forms: daajis+n →daajín
       and beerat+lo →beerashó, with the underlying forms exhibiting the basic forms of the
       causative affix is and the middle affix at. Presumably this approach would also include a
       rule dhammays+n→dhammáynfor the factitive affix ays.
 56.   One of the few papers devoted to compounds is Puglielli (In press).
 57.   Unlike for example the compound adjective tirabadán 'numerous, many' formed from
       tiró N F 'number, quantity' and badán ADJ 'much many'. See 5.4.3. for some other
       compound adjectives.
 58.   And other adjectives participate in this incorporation process; see for example:
       Odaygu          wuu      dumar      jeclaa
       old:man-the     DM+he women         liking+was
       'The old man was women-liking', 'The old man was a womaniser' [SNR 83.5]59.    Depending on the analysis of le, discussed in 5.3.3.2, it is possible to view this example
       as a compound composed of two nominals: baqó N F 'retreat' and the derived noun
       beenlé N M 'liar' (lit. 'one who possesses lies'), i.e. literally 'retreat of liar'.
60.    If aqóon can be analysed as a deverbal noun these compounds would become examples
       of the next type, deverbal or synthetic compounds.
61.    One question about these compounds concerns tlieir internal structure. Is xoghaye
       'secretary', for example, best bracketed as [ [ xog] - [ hay-e] ] or [ [ xoghay] ~e]] ? In
       other words, is this a compound of a noun and an agentive verbal noun or do we have a
       compound verb which is then nominalised by an agentive suffix? From the limited
       information available, it seems that the relevant compound verbs do not occur and so the
       first analysis seems preferable, though the evidence is not very strong.
62.    In this template, for simplicity, we treat the impersonal subject pronoun la as a subject
       clitic pronoun and the reflexive/reciprocal is as a first series object clitic pronoun. It is
       highly unlikely that all of these elements would occur together in a single verbal group.
       The template shows the maximum potential group and their relative ordering.
63.    As described in 4.2.2 and 6.1.2, object clitic pronouns have a third person gap in tlieir
       paradigm. Consequently lack of any other object clitic pronoun will result in a
       contextually appropriate third person reading. For brevity, in the glosses below we
       reflect this by arbitrarily placing one interpretation in parentheses and adding 'etc.'.
       Thus '(it etc.)' represents a contextual determined choice between 'it, him, her, them'.
                                        NOTES                                                 27364.   It is interesting however that the pronominal clitics maintain a SUB-OBJ-V (SOV) order
      that is commonly postulated as basic in Cushitic languages, even though the order of full
      noun phrases in sentences does not reflect grammatical functions but pragmatic
      processes of information packing, as we shall see in later chapters.
65.   The syntax of nominal focus is described in chapter 7 and its use in discourse in chapter
      9.
66.   This optionality also depends on the type of sentence and the distinction between main
      and subordinate clauses. For example, as described in chapter 7, negative main clauses
      occur very frequently without subject pronouns, as do yes-no questions. This means
      that simple main clauses may occur without a subject as in (1):
      (1)    (a) Má yaqaan?
                 QM know:3MSG
                 'Does he know (it)?'
             (b) Hàa, wàa yaqaan.
                 yes DM know:3MSG
                 'Yes, he knows it.'
             (c) Máya, má yaqáan.
                   no     NEG know: 3MSG:NEG
                   'No, he doesn't know it.'","[287, 288]"

3.4.1 Basic assignment    oftonalaccent
In this approach accentual patterns are assigned to words on the basis of their
grammatical status. Thereafter rules of morphology and syntax alter the basic
patterns. This means that the details ofindividual APs and changes on them are
best described in the relevant grammatical sections of this book. We can
however provide a few examples.
        Thus for example the feminine nouns of declension 1 have AP1 in the
singular: for example, warqád 'letter', and by the rule in (58c) above, cayáar
'game'. The masculine nouns ofdeclension 2 on the other hand have AP2 in the
singular: for example, síxir 'magic, sorcery', by rule (58b) above, qiràal
'confession'; and by rule (58c) above, múudal 'miser'. It is clear that it is the
grammatical distinction between these declensions that is responsible for the
different accentual patterns. Some roots, for example, may enter either
declension: for example the unaccented underlying form *wiyil 'rhinoceros' may
surface either as a declension 1 noun wiyíl 'female rhinoceros' or a declension 2
noun wiyil 'male rhinoceros'. Similar pairs are quite common and include: inán
'girl', ínan 'boy; ma1ían 'female twin', matàan 'male twin'; daméer 'female
donkey', damèer 'male donkey'.
       In the verbal system individual paradigms are distinguished by a
combination of inflection and accentual pattern. The accentual pattern alone
does not normally distinguish forms but there are some minimal pairs, for
example kéen (past independent 3.M.SG) 'He brought (it).'and kèen (imperative
SG) 'Bring (it)!'. Other grammatical categories have their associated accentual
patterns.    To use examples we have already seen: adpositions have a
characteristic pattern of AP1, while verbal pronouns have the pattern AP3.
There are some minimal pairs distinguished by this, for example the object
pronoun ku 'you' and the adposition kú 'in, into', the impersonal subject
                         PHONOLOGICAL RULES                                     43
pronoun la 'one, someone' and the adposition lá 'with'. Given the overall
pattern of the Somali accentual system, it seems preferable to identify the
accentual pattern of these forms with their grammatical category rather than as
lexical information. This is supported by the fact that there seem to be no cases
where words with the same grammatical features are distinguished by accentual
pattern. We give the accentual patterns of individual grammatical categories as
they are introduced, for example in chapters 4 and 5.","[57, 58]"

1.4   Design ofthis bookThe book has nine chapters with an appendix of selected texts. Chapters 2 and 3
deal with the sounds ofSomali: Chapter 2 outlines the phonological units ofthe
6                                    SOMALI
language, and Chapter 3 describes some of the most important phonological
rules. Chapter 4 sets out the basic word classes, or grammatical categories, of
the language, while Chapter 5 describes the derivational processes which
operate to extend the categories ofverb, noun, and adjective. This chapter also
discusses compounding. The next three chapters deal with syntax. Chapter 6 is
principally concerned with the internal structure of noun phrases and the verbal
group. Chapter 7 describes the structure ofsimple sentences and establishes the
major sentence types. Chapter 8 goes on to deal with subordinate clauses,
highlighting the central role of relative clauses. Finally, Chapter 9 is concerned
with those discourse processes that most fundamentally affect grammatical
structure, in particular the roles of focus and topic. Appendix II contains a brief
selection of extracts from various types of Somali texts, including both prose
and poetry, with morpheme by morpheme glosses and translations.
      The Somali examples in this book are taken from a combination of
sources. One of my main preoccupations in writing this study has been to use
language material that is as authentic as possible. Many of the examples were
recorded from native speakers over several years of fieldwork in Somalia and
Kenya, and from Somali speakers visiting and resident in the UK and Ireland.
Other examples are taken from a variety of published materials: textbooks and
other books published by the government ofthe Somali Republic, newspapers,
collections ofpoems and tales, etc. The principal published sources are listed in
Appendix I. As described in chapter 2, tonal accent plays an important role in
marking grammatical distinctions in Somali. Since it only makes a restricted
number of lexical distinctions, tonal accent is not marked in the official
orthography. In examples that were recorded from speech by the author, tonal
accent is always marked; in extracts from published sources it is not marked.
Chapter 2
Phonological units
In this chapter we present the inventory of the phonological units in standard
Somali, including consonant and vowel sounds, syllables and tonal units. We
also introduce the official Somali orthography which will be used to represent
examples in the rest of the book. The symbols of the International Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA) are used in square brackets [ ] to introduce the sounds and when
we need to discuss aspects of their phonetic realisation. We begin with the
consonants.","[20, 21, 22]"

This is an irrealis mood form and signifies a hypothetical situation in the present
or past, e.g. Waan légi lahaa ' I would go', 'I would have gone'. As this
example shows, this is an auxiliary construction formed with the main verb
infinitive followed by the adjective léh 'having, possessing' acting as the
complement of past simple forms of yahay 'be' (4.3.6). As is usual with
adjectives (4.4) the past tense of the copula yahay fuses with the adjective stem,
e.g. leh + ahaa → lahaa '(I/he) was having/had'. Interestingly, the negative
forms are not auxiliary constructions, e.g. Má diidnéen '(We) would not refuse',
'(We) would not have refused'. 31 The positive forms are:                      C1               C2                    C3

This is a second type of irrealis mood form and is used mainly to express wishes,
hopes and blessings, e.g. Há tago! 'May he go!', Ilaahay ha ku harakeeyo!
'May Allah bless you!', and the negative Khåmri yàanu cabbin! 'May he not
drink alcohol!'. The form is also used for strong suggestions and weakened
commands, e.g. Aan saméeyo 'Let me do it!', Aynu tágno 'Let's (INC) go!'. In
the positive, third person forms are preceded by the optative sentence type
marker (STM) ha.32 Other persons are obligatorily preceded by the appropriate
subject clitic pronoun, which may occur in the shortened forms an for lSG aan;
ad for 2SG aad (also used here for 2PL aydin); and annu for 1 PL EXC aannu.

 As described in chapter 8, for the most part verbs in subordinate clauses are
 distinguished from corresponding main clause forms by a combination of
 accentual pattern and, to a lesser degree, segmental inflection. The differences
 are caused by the intersection of two marking systems. The first marks the
 syntactic distinction between main and subordinate clauses; the second is case
marking. Clauses may perform various sentential functions such as subject,
object and adverbial and consequently are case marked. Again, as with
nominals, this case marking applies to the final or rightmost element in the
constituent. Since subordinate clauses usually are verb final, this case marking
falls on and influences verbal inflection.33 In outlining the system it is useful to
distinguish between relative clauses on the one hand, and other subordinate
clauses like complement clauses, and adverbial clauses introduced by elements
like márka 'when', haddíi ' i f , ilaa 'until', etc. All clauses share many of the
features we describe but relative clauses have some extra formal distinctions, as
we shall see.
       The first marking system differentiates main clause verbs from subordinate
clause verbs in their basic absolutive case. The differences are both segmental
and accentual. The segmental differences are limited to forms where the main
verb ends in -aa; here the subordinate clause forms end in -o, or optionally -id
for 2SG. The paradigms affected include present general, and present
progressive, as shown below in the subordinate clause forms of súg 'wait for':                  Present general                Present progressive

94                                      SOMALIThe accentual differences may be informally characterised as a modification of
main clause verb accentual patterns:(84) (a) The last syllable becomes high tone if short; falling tone if long.
     (b) If the last syllable is already high, as in some negative paradigms, it remains
         so.","[105, 106, 107, 108, 109]"
"This unusual pattern only occurs when the focused element is subject of the
negative and thus clitic subject pronouns do not occur. When these pronouns
do occur they coalesce with the cluster of focus word and negative. The initial
vowel of the pronoun is shortened if long and the expected accentual pattern
occurs, as in (38) with an example in (39):(38)    bàa      +      åan 'not'     +      aan       'I'            →     bàanan

construction. W e compare the discourse functions of wáxa(a)                and bàalayàa       in
chapter 9. The typical use o f a wáxa(a)       construction is to place into focus a long
noun phrase or a clause occurring after the verbal group. Thus wáxa(a),                    unlike
bàalayàa,    is not used to focus the intensifier aad (cf. (29) above) and indeed
does not generally focus shorter, non-clausal adverbials. As w i t h                 bàalayàa,
wáxa(a) may not focus the verb, any element o f the verbal group, or functional
categories. The focused element may be a subject (40 b e l o w ) , an object (41), a
predicate nominal (42) or an adverbial (43). It may be a noun phrase (40), an in
'that' clause (42), or a direct quotation (45). Wáxa(a) constructions are difficult
to translate directly into English: in the f o l l o w i n g examples w e sometimes use
English it-clefts, sometimes wh-pseudo            clefts and at other times existential
t h e r e - c o n s t r u c t i o n s . The resulting structural parallels are often not    very
felicitous, especially in the case o f adverbial clauses, like (41 b e l o w ) . I n the

"4.1.1.1 Gender
There are two genders: all nouns are either masculine or feminine. For the most
part gender is not predictable from the meaning of nouns. The exceptions
include nouns for people and animals: nin 'man' is masculine and náag 'woman'
is feminine, for example. Even here though there are arbitrary cases: the
collective noun hawéen 'women' is masculine.
      This arbitrariness ofgender is emphasised by the fact that Somali exhibits
the gender polarity found in other Cushitic languages. Many nouns reverse their
gender in the plural, as shown in the examples below, where the polarity extends
over different types ofplural formation by suffixes and accentual change:        (2) Masculine → Feminine
        sánnad M 'year'                      sannaddó      F     'years'
        abti        M 'maternal uncle'       abtiyóo       F     'maternal uncles'
        túke M 'crow'                        tukayáal F 'crows'
        barbàar M 'bachelor'                 barbáar F 'bachelors'

        àwr        M 'male camel'             awr           F     'male camels'

        hooyo      F    'mother'              hooyóoyin     M     'mothers'Though this is the dominant pattern, not all plurals involve gender polarity:
masculine nouns which mark their plural by reduplication and a subgroup of
masculine suffixing nouns remain masculine in the plural:(4)   Masculine → Masculine
        wán        M      'ram'               wanán         M     'rams'
        béer       M      'liver'             beerár        M     'livers'

        wáran      M     'spear'              warmó         M     'spears'Gender is reflected grammatically in three important forms of agreement:
agreement with the set of suffixed determiners, subject-verb agreement, and
agreement with clitic subject pronouns. We can show these first with singular
nouns.
        The determiners, discussed in 4.6 below, include definite articles,
demonstratives, possessives, etc. and divide into two formal agreement classes:
a masculine class which has basic forms with initial k֊ and a feminine class with
initial t-. We saw in chapter 3 that these forms undergo complex rules ofsandhi
when attached to the noun but simple examples with the remote definite article
-kίil-tίi are:(5) baabùurN M      'truck'    +kíi      →         baabuurkii 'thetruck(remote)'
    náag N F        'woman'   +tíi       →         náagtíi    'thewoman(remote)'Subject - verb agreement is marked on the verb by a set ofagreement affixes. In
the majority class of suffix verbs these are attached after the stem composed of
the verb root and any derivational affixes, while in the minority class ofprefix or
strong verbs, they attach as prefixes to the root. For example in prefix verbs a
distinction is made between the affixes y- 3sGM and ŕ- 3SGF:(6)    Baabuurkii wu.u yimi.
       baabuur-kii    wàa+uu           yimi

"We shall see examples of some of these word order patterns in section 9.3
where we examine a short text.
        To summarise, we can contrast the fixed constituent order inside the NP
and the VPG with the great positional freedom of NPs around the VPG. Within
this freedom of order we can detect a bias towards an underlying verb-final
order which may be overridden by a number of factors. Important among these
is the positional freedom of known or activated nominals that are represented as
clitics within the VPG. Such varying orders are appropriate in different discourse
contexts. Another important factor is the presentational use of wáxa(a) clefts to
place focused elements after the verb.
244                                      SOMALI
       Although the study of these discourse processes in Somali has scarcely
begun we might venture a couple of simple hypotheses which might be tested in
future work. We can take as two basic sentence types: (a) focus sentences with
hàalayàa and (b) non-focus sentences with waa. We can identify in each a core,
as follows:(50) Focus sentences with bàalayàa
       X    -       [CORE FOCUS...Z...VPG]           -    Y
(51) Non-focus sentences with waa
       X        -   [CORE waa - VPG]     -           Y
In both sentence types typical participant NPs can only occur in positions X and
Y if they are activated and represented by clitic pronouns in the core.106 We can
call position X the topic and position Y the afterthought topic, respectively,
understanding that more than one NP can occur in either position. As we have
seen certain unactivated or new elements may occur in these positions without
being topics: adverbials and locative NPs can occur in both X and Y, and 'heavy'
elements like complement clauses can occur in position Y. In the focus sentence
pattern (50) position Z may be occupied by either new or activated nominals but
the latter do not act as topics in this position.
       This is only the slightest sketch but allows us to reflect that a combination
of overt focus markers (hàalayàa), word order, and clitic pronouns linguistically
signal certain important pragmatic roles, particularly of focus and topic. It will
require the study of different sentence types in texts across of range of different
genres to fill out these few tentative suggestions.
       It is perhaps worth noting that the relationship between a topic and the
core predication may be of various types. Most frequently, the topic is
coreferential with a core argument expressed by a pronoun, as in (52) below:(52)   Anigu geel,        ido      iyo       riyo        badan    baan        haystaa.
       Me    camels       sheep    and       goats       many     FOC+I       have
       ' M e , I have MANY CAMELS, SHEEP AND GOATS.'             [TD 84.33]
Though this coreferential element is most commonly a clitic pronoun, it may
also be another element with a referential function, for example a possessive
determiner as in:(53)   Hooyo, artiga ilmahaygu wacal                 ma aha.
       mother me          child-my        bastard    not is
       'Mother, (as for) me, my child is not a bastard.' [SHN 106.1]
                                 DISCOURSE                                       245In this example, since the topic aniga 'me' is not coreferential with the subject
of the sentence ilmahaygu 'my child', it is not subject marked.
       The topic may also be in a set-subset, or partitive, relationship with an
argument in the core, as in (54) below: (54)    hase yeeshee       saddexdii bakheyl mid       ka       mid    ah
         however            three-the   miser   one     from one        be
         ayaa diiday inuu wax ka                bixiyo qiimihii feynuuska.
         FOC refused that-he thing from pay               cost-the light-the
         'however, the three misers, ONE OF THEM refused to pay anything towards the
         cost of the light' [SNR 14. 2-3]
9.2     Reference assignmentThere is a range of nominal forms available to speakers to help manage
reference to entities within a discourse. Indefinite nominals, which are often
used to introduce new entities into the discourse are unmarked, i.e. there is no
indefinite marker or article in Somali. See for example the first line of a story:(55)      Waa baa waxaa israacay                 laba nin oo saaxiib
         time FOC wáxaa RE-accompanied two man and friend
         ahaan jirtey
         be:INF used-to
         'ONCE there travelled together two men who were friends.' [MCI 12.17]In this sentence the two referring nominals waa 'time', and laba nin 'two men'
(lit. 'two of man') are new and undefined.
        When the first mention has been made an entity is activated as part of the
frame of attention and may be referred to by a range of definite nominals and
pronouns. In this story the two men are referred to in the second sentence by
the subject clitic pronoun ay 'they' (4.2.1), and the possessive determiner -
koodl-tood 'their' (4.6.4), both marked in bold below:(56)    Goor ay         labadoodu meel marahayaan bay                  waxay
        time they two-their           place pass:PROG        FOC+they wáxa+they
        iswarsadeen in       nin      walba wuxuu             jecel yahay in
        RE-askedthat      man        each      thing-the+he liking be          that
        Eebbe ugu         roonado sheegto.
        God      to+for grant        tell.
        'As the two of them were passing along, they agreed that each man should say
        what he would like God to grant him.'[MCI 12.18-19]
246                                  SOMALI
As can be seen, within this sentence the pattern is repeated. A new quantified
nominal nin walba 'each man' is introduced by an indefinite NP and then this
nominal is anaphorically referred to by a subject clitic pronoun uu 'he' and then
later in the sentence by the zero third person object pronoun (4.2.2).
        In subsequent sentences the men, singly or together, are referred to by
noun phrases containing the remote definite article -kiiltii 'the' (4.6.1) which is
used for referents distant in space or temporally in the past and which in
discourse has an anaphoric function. Thus in successive sentences we find nin-
kii kale 'the other man', laba-dii nin 'the two men', as well as further uses of
the subject clitic pronouns ay 'they', uu 'he' and zero third person object
pronouns.
        In the middle of the story another character is introduced by an indefinite
noun nin rati subag uu  saaran wata 'a man driving a camel loaded with
clarified butter' :(57)   Markaas muddo yar dabadeed baa iyagoo meel marahay
       time-that period little after-its FOC they-and place pass:PROG
       waxaa      ka     hor yimid nin rati              subag             uu 
       wáxaa      from front came man camel clarified:buttter he on
       saaran     wata.
       loaded     drive.
       'A short time after that, while they were passing a place, there came before
       them a man driving a camel loaded with clarified butter.' [MCI 13.9-11]In the next clause following (57) the two men are referred to again, this time by
a noun phrase containing a demonstrative determiner -kaasl-taas 'that, those'
(4.6.2) used deictically for objects in the middle distance, laba-daas nin 'those
two men'. The new character is referred to with the remote definite article -kiil­
tii: nin-kii safar-ka ahaa 'the man who was a traveller'. In this way the
demonstrative picks out the entities, the two men, 'on the other side', so to
speak, of the newly introduced character. The two types of determiner are used
to operate a form of discourse deixis.
       Thus we can see a series of nominal forms being used to manage reference
to entities within the discourse: indefinite nominals, clitic pronouns, nominals
with the remote article -kiiltii, and with the middle distance demonstrative -
kaasl-taas. One other feature of this system is worth noting: clitic pronouns
must occur within the verbal group; therefore when a pronoun is selected
elsewhere in a sentence, to act as a topic, or head of a relative clause, or in
focus, then an independent pronoun must be used. Thus in (56) above we find
                                 DISCOURSE                                        247the appositive relative clause iyagoo meel marahay 'they, passing a place'
headed by the independent pronoun iyága 'they, them' (4.1.3).","[258, 259, 260, 261, 262]"
"4.1.1 Common nouns
Common nouns typically carry information from the grammatical systems of
gender, number and case, which are marked by the morphological processes of
accentual change, suffixation and reduplication.",[69]
"Since independent pronouns normally occur with the suffixed determiner, we
deal with subject marking in the discussion of case marking on determiners in
4.6.",[84]
"4.10.1       Time adverbs
There are a small number of adverbs that are clearly derived from corresponding
nouns signifying periods of time but which are themselves not nouns. They may
be focused by the focus words bàa and ayàa but they do not occur with the
suffixed nominal determiners (4.6), do not have inherent number, or gender and
are not case marked. Their function is clearly adverbial in that they locate in
time the situation described in the clause. The main examples, together with
corresponding nouns, are:(166)    berrito     'tomorrow՝            cf. berrí      NF   'tomorrow'
         sháleyto    'yesterday'           cf. sháley     NF   'yesterday'
         xáleyto     'last night""           cf. xálay     NF   'last night'
         dórraato    'day before yesterday' cf. dórraad   NF   'day before yesterday
There are a few other adverbs formed by this suffix -to, e.g. kaléeto Tike,
similar' from the attributive adjective kalé 'other'; hadhówto 'later on, soon'
from the noun phrase hád dhów ' a near time'; dhowéyto 'recently' cf. dhów ADJ
'near', dhowèe v CAUS 'bring near'. The derivation does not seem to be
productive.
       There are other time adverbials which have no obvious corresponding
nouns, for example:(167)               cáawa (cáawey)          'tonight'
                    ciyòw (ciyòorì)         'immediately, soon'

synchronically in is grammaticali sed as a complementiser and is semantically
empty; see for example:(68)     Ínuu    imánayó ayàan ógahay.
       that+he is: coming FOC+I aware-am
       M know that he is coming.'
(69)   Inuu      imánayaa waa           hub áaI.
       that+he is: coming DM            certainty
       That he is coming is certain.'
(70)   Wáxaan dóonayaa            ínaan     tagó.
       wáxa+l     am: wanting that+I         go
       T want to go.' (lit. T want that I go')These examples show in clauses acting like nominal arguments: the clause is
object in (68) and subject in (69) and is case marked accordingly. The clause is
marked as in focus by ayàa in (68) and by wáxa in (70).
        The word in acts like the headword of a relative clause in that in attracts
certain elements out of the verbal group, notably subject clitic pronouns, as in
the examples above, and the subordinate negative word áan 'noť as in (71)
below. As with relative clause heads, when both elements occur they coalesce:

         'He said that he didn't understand it.'","[239, 240]"
"4.2.3 Non-specific subject pronounThe non-specific subject pronoun la, which we gloss in English as 'one', takes
third person masculine singular verbal agreement and is typically used with a
transitive verb when the speaker does not know or wishes to suppress the
identity of the subject, for example:(61)   Wàa la xaday.
       wàa      la    xaday
       DM       one    stole: 3 SG M
       Tt was stolen/, lit. 'One stole it'
(62)   Wàa lagu arkay.
       wàa      la-ku          arkay
       DM      one-y ou:SG saw:3 SG M
       'You (SG) were seen/, lit. 'One saw you (SG)'This pronoun is also used when the subject is so general as to be vague, for
example in the formulaic beginning to stories wáxaa la yidhí 'what one said...'
or 'It is told... ', or as in the following example:(63)   Dúmarku waa beló tóo haahànyahày.
       dúmar-ku     waa       beló     la+ú      baahan-yahay
       women-the DM         disaster   one+of needful:ADJ-is:3SGM
       'Women are a necessary evil',
       (lit. 'Women are a disaster which one is needful o f )These uses mean that constructions with la are functionally equivalent to some
uses of passive constructions in other languages, and indeed there is no syntactic
passive in Somali. There are other grammatical mechanisms which share the
functional domain of passives in other languages, as we shall see, for example
the verbal derivational affix -am described in 5.1.4, which removes an agent
from a causative verb and promotes the causee to subject.
      The pronoun la has often been called an impersonal subject pronoun but
we avoid the term here because unlike some impersonal constructions in other
languages, such as impersonal passives, la cannot be used with intransitive
                          GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                               77
verbs. Thus one cannot say (64a) below but must instead use a full nominal qóf
N M 'person' in (64b):(64)    (a)    *Wàa      la    dhinlay.
               DM        one died
            'One died', 'Someone died'
        (b)    Qóf       bàa dhintay.
               person FOC died
            'A person died', 'Someone died'Note too that la can only be used for human entities and is thus restricted to
verbs which could have a human subject.
         As described in chapter 6, la occurs in the verbal group in the same
position as other subject pronouns and thus precedes adpositions and object
clitic pronouns, with which it coalesces. Earlier, in 3.3.3 we described its
coalescence with adpositions. The following shows la combining with object
clitic pronouns:(65)    la      +      i       'me'      →         lay
        la      +      ku      'you (SG)' →        lagu
        la      +      na      'us (EXC)   →       nala
        la      +      ina     'us (INC)  →        laynaAn example is in (63) above. Note that la undergoes metathesis when combining
with a monosyllabic morpheme beginning with a nasal, as in nala in (65). This
also occurs in combinations with the negative word má, which normally
precedes the elements of the verbal group; compare (66a) and (66b):(66)    (a)     Má'uu cunó.
                må-uu cunó
                not-he    eat:NEG
                'He doesn't eat it.'
       (b)    Lamá curio.
                la-má    cunó
                one-not eat:NEG
                'One does not eat it.', It isn't eaten.'","[91, 92]"
"In (87a) the head nominal qálabka 'the equipment' is object of the verb èeg
'look at' and the absolutive case marking occurs on the relative clause verb
shaqèe 'work'. In (87b) the same head nominal is subject of a verbless sentence
and here the relative verb carries subject marking. We can compare the different
inflection on the relative clause verb shaqèe 'work'.
       A second agreement pattern emerges when the gap in the relative clause is
subject of the relative clause verb. When this occurs the relative verb shows a
reduced agreement pattern, called 'convergent' by Andrzejewski (1968). These
reduced agreement forms show a smaller number of person distinctions and, in
present tense forms, a segmental change. The person reduction alone can be

A comparison w i t h the main clause forms i n 4.3.4.6 reveals three differences:
the verbs i n (88) and (89) have the accentual pattern o f subordinate clause verbs
in absolutive case; they exhibit reduced person differentiation; and the ending -
aa is reduced t o -a.
       A s w i t h other relative clause verbs, these reduced agreement forms carry
the subject marking for the w h o l e NP, as usual b o t h segmentally and accentually.
The m a r k i n g is similar t o other subordinate clause case marking: forms ending i n
-a w i l l lengthen t o -aa; and the accentual pattern w i l l become A P 3 .         Thus w e
can compare the f o l l o w i n g , where again the nominal head and m o d i f y i n g relative
clause are schematically represented (and [SUBJ ] represents the gap subject o f
the relative clause):

         'The men who are bringing it are thieves.'","[110, 111]"
"4.6.1 Definite articlesThere are two definite articles, carrying a distinction of distance in space and
time, shown with examples below:(114)                 Non-remote article                 Remote article
Masculine                  ka                                 kii
Feminine                    ta                                tíi
       náagta    'the woman (non-remote)'        náagtii 'the woman (remote)
       nínka     'the man (non-remote)'          ninkii   'the man (remote)'I f the referent of the noun is distant from the speaker, or is in the past, the
remote forms kíiItíi are used; the article ka/ta is unmarked spatially, and is used
for referents temporally located in the present and the future. This distinction
has a discourse analogue: the determiner kíiItíi is used as a form of discourse
anaphora, picking out entities introduced earlier in the discourse, as described in
chapter 9.
       When the article is the last element in the noun phrase it will carry subject
marking, and undergo the changes exemplified below:(115)                   Absolutive            Subject
                         ninka                ninku

                         ninkii               ninkii
                         náagtii              nâagtii
The article ka/ta undergoes a segmental change to ku/tu, while the article kiiltii
undergoes a tonal lowering.
      The articles may occur without a head nominal as a kind of pronominal,
e.g. (116); in this function they may occur in the plural forms in (117),
undifferentiated for gender:(116)   (a)     kii     yimi
                the:M came
                'the one (MASC) who came'
        (b)     tii     kalé
                the:F    other

(117)   (a)     kúwa     'the ones (non-remote)'
        (b)     kúwíi    'the ones (remote)'There is no indefinite article, nor as exist in some Cushitic languages, paucal or
individuating suffixes.37 There is however one element ku 'one' (feminine tu;
plural kuwo) with a very limited distribution, which may be a relic of such an
element. This word does not occur suffixed to nominals but as the head of a
few constructions, especially with the adjective kalé 'other', e.g.:(118)   ku kalé          'another one (MASC)'
        kuwo kalé        'some others, some more'
4.6.2 DemonstrativesThere are four demonstrative determiners, which are suffixed to the noun and
which undergo the same rules of sandhi as other determiners (3.2.1). The
demonstratives divide up the space around the speaker into four zones:(119)    Masculine      Feminine
          kán            tán          'this, these' (close to speaker)
         káa(s)          táa(s)       'that, those' (further away from speaker)
         kéer            té er         'that, those' (in the middle distance)
         kóo             tóo          'that, those' (in the far distance)The basic use then is to provide four zones of increasing distance from the
speaker. The demonstratives kán/tán and káas/táas are also used for temporal
and discourse deixis.
      When carrying the phrasal subject marking for the NP, these
demonstratives undergo the changes exemplified below, with optional variants
in parentheses:(120)   Absolutive          Subject
         ninkán            ninkanu (ninkani)         'this man'
         náagtán           náagtanu (náagtani)       'this woman'
         ninkáa(s)         ninkaasu (ninkaasi)       'that man'
         náagtáa(s)        náagtaasu (náagtaasi)     'that woman'
         ninkéer           ninkeeri                  'that man' (middle distance)
         náagtéer          nàagteeri                 'that woman' (middle distance)
         ninkóo            ninkooyì                  'that man' (far distance)
         náagtóo           náagtooyì                 'that woman' (far distance)
 114                                   SOMALI      The demonstratives can also occur alone as pronominal forms, and in this
role have plural forms which are not differentiated for gender, e.g.:(121)     \bsolutive          Subject
           kúwán             kúwanu (kúwani)        'these ones'
           kúwáa(s)          kúwaasu (kúwaasi)      'those ones'
           kúwéer            kúweeri                'those ones' (middle distance)
           kúwóo             kúwooyi                'those ones' (far distance)
4.6.3   InterrogativesThe interrogative determiners kée 'which (mase)?' and tée 'which (fem)?' are
used to question nouns, for example:(122)   ninkée      'which man?'    naagtée 'which woman?'","[127, 128, 129]"
"
4.6.4 Possessives
The possessive determiners show once again the class features of being suffixed
to a head noun, of agreeing with it in gender and of undergoing the sandhi rules
in 3.2.1. The set is:
                       GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                            115(125)          Masculine       Feminine
               kàyga           tàyda              'my'
               kàaga           tàadct             'your (SG)'
               kìisa           Hìisa              'his'
               kèeda           tèeda              'her'
               kayága          tayáda             'our (EXC)'
               kèenna          tèenna             'our (INC)'
               Hinna           tìinna             'your (PL)'
               kòoda           tòoda              'their'For example:
               gúrigáyga       'my house'                 (cf. gúri N M 'house')
               fárasHìisa      'his horse'                (cf. fáras N M 'horse')
               gèelayága       'our (EXC) camels'         (cf. gèel N M COLL 'camels')
      These forms are interesting in their morphology. Firstly we may note that
k- forms attach to masculine nouns and t- forms to feminine nouns as usual with
determiners. However these forms consist of two elements: a possessive
determiner followed by the definite article kalta described in 4.6.1, e.g. kày-ka
→ kàyga 'my'. In this case the definite article undergoes normal determiner
sandhi but there are also some unusual rules. Firstly, wherever the possessive
element ends in a consonant other than n the first consonant of the article is
dropped, e.g. kìis-ka → kìisa rather than the predicted *kìiska. Secondly when
the possessive ends in n, the initial consonant of the article assimilates to n, e.g.
kèen-ka → kèenna 'our (INC MASC)', tè en-ta → tèenna 'our (INC FEM)'.
      This combination of possessive and article is the basic form but
possessives occur with the full range of determiners, with associated meanings,
for example:(126)   remote article kíi/tìi :     gúhgàagii   'your house (remote)'
        demonstrative káas/táas:     gúrigàagáas 'that house of yours'
        interrogative kée/tée:       gurigaagée? 'which house of yours?'","[129, 130]"
"Banti (1988b), citing evidence for a similar lowering rule in nouns in another
Cushitic language Arbore, spoken in Ethiopia, suggests that this rule is a relic of
an earlier common Cushitic rule.
      A further accentual rule, which we can term Accent Shift, affects singular
nouns ofdeclensions 6 and 7 and shifts their absolutive case pattern ofAP1 to
AP2 before a pause, for example:(76) hooyó F 'mother' →        hóoyo
     baré M 'teacher' →        báreThis rule also affects some collective nouns, e.g. socotó F 'travellers' → socóto.
Since isolation is a subset ofthe pre-pause position, these AP2 forms will occur
as elicited forms.
       In our present state of knowledge rules like Accent Lowering and Accent
Shift can be described but not given any more general explanation. As we have
said, the full range of processes that alter accentual patterns in various
phonological and grammatical contexts remains to be investigated.

3.5    ReduplicationReduplication processes mark a number of grammatical and semantic
distinctions, all sharing an iconic meaning of 'increase'. There are two main
types: suffixing and prefixing reduplication. Suffixing reduplication applies to
mark the plurals of one declension (D4) of masculine nouns; these are quite
numerous and we present a few representative examples:(77)           Singular           Meaning             Plural
               jid                'road'             jidád
               jίir               'rat'              jiirâr
                wéd               'death'             wedád
                beer              iiver'              beerár
               qál                'jaw'               qalál
               aas                'burial'            aasás
               bóg                'page'              bogág
               ròob               'rain'              roobáb
               tús                'bookmark'          tusás
               suun               'belt'             suumán
               dèyr               'fence'            deyrár
               dàwr               'role'             dawrár
               càysh              'food'             caysháshThe nouns in (77) form their plurals by appending a final syllable consisting of
the short vowel a followed by a copy ofthe stem final consonant, i.e. by a -aC
reduplicating suffix. Since all nouns in this declension end in a consonant, the
only complication in these examples is that the reduplicated suffix allows the
underlying nasal m in sinm (←*sùum) 'belt' to resurface since it is no longer in
word final position. If as discussed in 3.1.1, the correct generalisation is that m
does not occur syllable finally, this suggests the syllabification of sùumán 'belts'
is sùu$mùn.
      There are several prefixing reduplication rules which operate in adjectives
and verbs, as shown in (78) - (81) below. Firstly, prefixing reduplication marks
the plural forms of an important subset of adjectives, given in (78), with an
example in (79):(78)          Singular            Meaning            Plural
              adùg               'hard, difficult'   adadùg

types:(I) Caa- prefixation, where the first stem consonant is copied, followed by a
long aa vowel. This process is the most marked form of prefix reduplication
and is restricted to a small number ofadjectives, perhaps two; it is exemplified in
(78) by dhaadhèer and waawèyn. Banti (1988a) argues that this is an ancient
form ofreduplication within Cushitic.","[62, 63, 64, 65]"
" (III) CV- prefixation, where the reduplicated prefix is a copy ofthe stem's first
 consonant and vowel. Again the prefix vowel must match the first stem vowel
 in length. In this rule the initial consonant ofthe stem is also doubled where this
 is allowed by the syllable structure constraints. Examples ofthis process include
 the adjectives dhuudhuubán, and guggubán in (78) and the verbs duuddúub and
jajáb in (80).

We can see from our examples that one or two adjectives allow type (II) or
(III), for example the more usual dhaadhèer or its variant dheerdhèer.
Moreover there are some forms which need further phonological explanation
such as gó '→ googgó ' in (80), which is rather like type (III) but in which the
prefix vowel does not match the stem vowel in length.
Chapter 4
Grammatical Categories
In this chapter we outline the main grammatical categories or word classes of
Somali. We concentrate here on the morphology ofthe basic members ofeach
category, leaving those members derived by productive rules ofword formation
to chapter 5 and discussion oftheir phrasal syntax to chapters 6 and 7. Somali
is characterised by a high degree of inflectional complexity, especially in the
verbal system, and while sometimes it is possible to capture generalisations with
rules, often these rules would be so complicated that it is more effective to
present the forms in a paradigmatic display.
       We identify ten basic categories, with the following abbreviations:        (1) Noun (N)
        Clitic pronoun (CPRO)
        Verb (V)
        Adjective (ADJ)
        Verbal adposition (ADP)
        Determiner (DET)
        Focus word (FOC)
        Sentence type marker (STM)
        Conjunction (CONJ)
        Adverb (ADV)Three of these categories are open, that is new members can freely be added:
noun, verb and adjective. Six others are closed in that they form systems that
cannot easily be extended: clitic pronoun, determiner, focus word, sentence type
marker and conjunction. The category of adverb is somewhat marginal, as we
shall see, and falls somewhere between an open and closed category.
       Most of the categories have subcategories: nouns are divided into such
subclasses as common nouns, names, independent pronouns, etc.; verbs into
54                                   SOMALI
main and auxiliary verbs, and so on. There are also two groups of rather
idiosyncratic elements which we will not list as major categories: ideophones,
discussed in 4.11, and the interjections, attention-gainers, etc. described in 4.12.","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69]"
"3.2.5 Verbal agreement affixes
In this section we provide one or two examples of sound changes at the juncture
in verbs between the verbal stem and the agreement markers, AGR. The
agreement marker t (2sG and 3SGF) undergoes progressive sound changes at the
juncture with the verb stem and thus acts like the t of the determiner suffix and
not the t of the middle voice affix, for example: *qaad + tay → qaadday
 'you/she took'. Other examples:        *go ' + tay           →          go 'day    'you/she cut'
        *raac + tay           →          raacday     'you/she followed'
        *sooh + tay           →          soohday    'you/she wove'
        *tookh + tay          →          tookhday   'you/she boasted'
        *faq + tay            →         faqday      'you/she consulted secretly'
       *bilaw + tay           →          bilawday   'you/she began'

        *xidh + tay → xidhdhay 'you/she tied'
        *hel + tay → heshay 'you/she found'The agreement marker n (lPL) assimilates to a stem fmal r or l:        (33) *fur + nay → furray 'we opened'
        *hel + nay → hellay 'we found'
3.3   CoalescenceOne of the characteristic features of Somali is the widespread occurrence of
coalescence rules which apply when words form part of phrases and sentences.
This merging of forms, a kind of external sandhi, is sometimes a feature of the
style of speech: whether the speech is fast or slow, formal or informal.
However many of the rules are not dependent on the style of speech and are
obligatory. There has been very little study of the variation in coalescence
across speech styles but in our examples we try to note those cases which seem
obligatory. As will be seen, it is the functional categories like verbal adpositions,
focus and negative words, verbal pronouns and conjunctions which are involved
in these rules of phonological merger. We might identify these elements as
clitics, entities whose grammatical status lies between the affix and the
independent word. However it is important to note that cliticisation and
coalescence are in principle distinct: some clitics like the conjunctions -na 'and'
and -se 'but' (4.9) must attach to a preceding host but do not undergo
phonological merger with them, while the elements described below only merge
under certain conditions. Some coalesce only when adjacent to certain
grammatical categories, as do the verbal adpositions, for example ú 'to, for',
while others, like the verbal pronouns, do so only in certain phonological
environments. We select here a few characteristic examples; further examples
appear in the texts in Appendix II.","[49, 50]"
"6.2.3.1 Adjectives (4.4, 6.1.5)
Adjectives used attributively follow the head noun and suffixed determiners and
are formally equivalent to restrictive relative clauses, as discussed in 6.1.5
above.70 Some adjectives agree with plural head nominals by a process of
reduplication, described in 3.5. Sequences of adjectives follow the rules for
restrictive relatives clauses, i.e. are linked by oo 'and' on an indefinite head NP
and by  'and' on a definite NP (8.1). Some examples are:(56)   (a)    shúqul adág
              work       hard
              'hard work'
       (b)    buuró         dhaadhèer
              mountains high
              'high mountains'
       (c)    wìil dhèer όο dhuubán
              boy tall          and thin
              'a tall thin boy'
       (d)    wìilka dhèer  dhuubán
              boy-the tall        and thin
              'the tall thin boy' 6.2.3.2 A ttributive adjectives (4.4.3)
Attributive adjectives are not used predicatively and do not mark plural
agreement by reduplication. When co-occurring with predicative adjectives or
relative clauses they occur first after the head nominal. There seems little
justification to view these as a form of relative clause modification. Examples:(57)   (a)    xáragga saré
              skin-the topmost
              'the outer skin'
       (b)      dhínac kastá
                side      every
                'every side'

for an attribute of a head nominal to be described by a relative clause containing
a noun as complement of yahay 'be' or the adjective léh 'having', for example:(60)   (a)    nín      xòog         léh
              man strength has: SUBORD
               'a strong man' (lit. 'a man who has strength')

              'a special tree' (lit. 'a tree which is specialness')

                food-the     solitude is:SUBORD
                'the only food' (lit. 'the food which is aloneness')6.2.4 Multiple modifiers
One rule is common to all nominal modifiers: after the first modifier all others
must be introduced by a conjunction, oo or , both meaning 'and'. So for
example if one adds a further nominal modifier to a genitive NP, it must be
introduced by a conjunction:(61)    [ head taariikhdii] [mod Soomáaliya]  [modberyihii horé]
        [history-the ABS ]     [Somalia GEN]          and [times-the       early GEN|
        'the early history of Somalia' (lit. 'the history of Somalia and of early times')Similarly with any further modification of a quantified nominal:(62)    labá kóob          óo       shàah áh
        two    cup:GEN and tea              is:SUBORD
        'two cups of tea' (lit. 'two of cup and which are tea')In examples (56) and (57) above we saw this same behaviour with ordinary and
attributive adjectives. The distinction between the conjunctions oo and  is
discussed further in chapter 8. Basically: on indefinite heads only oo is possible
and there it is a marker of appositive relative clauses; on definite heads  marks
restrictive modification and oo appositive modification. Genitive constructions
necessarily involve restrictive modification so oo is never found in multiple
genitives like:(63)    [head wakaaládda] [mod warárka]  [mod dálka              Ciráaq]
        agency-the          news:PL-the       and country-the Iraq
        'the Iraqi News Agency' (lit. 'the agency of news and of the country of Iraq')
6.3    Discontinuous phrasesFrom the examples and analyses thus far in this chapter it may be clear that
much of the information about the semantic relations of a clause is encoded in
the verbal group. With one relation in particular this means that an important
semantic relationship is not reflected syntactically: the governing of NPs by
verbal adpositions. As described in 4.5, the adpositions ú, kú, ká and lá assign
180                                       SOMALI
various semantic roles to nominals outside the VGP including location, source,
goal, instrument, manner, comitative, etc.        One major function of this
relationship between a verbal adposition and a nominal is to provide adverbial
modification of the clause, in particular ú governing the noun si N F 'manner,
way'. See for example:(64) Sidée bàad ú sameysey?
way-which FOC+you in did
        'How did you do you it?' (lit. 'In which way did you do it?')
(65) Si         xún bùu             ú sameeyey.
        way     bad FOC+he in did
        'He did it badly.' (lit. 'in a bad way')The noun si may be modified in any number of ways by determiners, adjectives
and relative clauses to form adverbial expressions and it is useful to refer to the
discontinuous elements as an adverbial unit, e.g.:(66)       sidán... ú                      'thus, in this way'
           sidáas.              ..ú        ' like that, in that way '
           si diiran ...ú                  ' warmly '
           si qaabdarán...ú                'improperly, incorrectly'
           si uun... ú                      'somehow, in one way or another'
           si wanaagsán ...ú                 ' well'
           si badán áh...ú                 ' abundantly '
           si cad         áh...       ú    'clearly, plainly'
           si gàar áh...ú                  'especially'       When talking of these adverbial units we are in fact identifying a
discontinuous adverbial phrase, a strategy which is also useful in discussing the
commonly used intensifying phrase àad...ú 'much, a lot', e.g.:(67)   Áad bùu            ú jecélyahay.
       much FOC+he in liking-is
       'He likes it very much.'","[192, 193, 194, 195]"
"This suggests that the accentual seesaw is sensitive to phonetic rather than
phonological tone.
      Another example of contextual variation is exhibited by the verb phrase
conjunction 00 'and'. Before a following word this has High tone while before
a pause this becomes Falling tone:(72) (a)  Wuu kacay 00 baxay.
     wáa+uu kacay 00 baxay
     DM+he rose and left
         'He got up and left. '
     (b)  Wuu kacay 00, baxay.
         wáa+uu       kacay 00 baxay
         DM+he rose and left
         'He got up and, [pause] left. 'We may treat the accentual pattern on 00 in (72b) as a form of discourse
marker, where the speaker uses a marker of intended continuation to defend
against interruption. In other contexts, for example fast speech, 00 may be de-
accented and cliticized onto a preceding element. This often occurs when 00
marks an appositive relative clause on an independent pronoun (8.2):(73)   iságoo      hurdá
       he+and      sleeps
       'he, who sleeps', 'while he is/was sleeping'       In addition to these variable elements there are a range of contextual
accentual changes which remain to be investigated. For example, most plural
nouns, and the singular nouns in declension 8, have in their basic absolutive case
High tone on their final mora which lowers to a Low tone in certain contexts.
This rule, which we can call Accent Lowering, is also associated with a deletion
of stress. The contexts form a rather heterogeneous phonetic and syntactic
class: lowering does not take place when the noun is before a pause (including
isolation), when it is the head ofdependent elements like determiners, adjectives

does occur when the bare unfocused noun occurs before the verbal group, or as
noted by Banti (1988b), before the focus word baa and the clitic bá 'any':(74) Non-lowering contexts

"Sentence-level intonation patterns do exist in Somali and carry signals of the
speaker's attitude and of emotional colouring, in ways that have not been
studied so far. However the use of pitch at word level means that intonation has
a smaller communicative load than in languages like English.
      A fourth feature of the tonal system is the relatively restricted set of tone
patterns. As noted by Andrzejewski (1964, 1968, 1979) and Hyman (1981), all
roots of common nouns, verbs and adjectives have one of three basic tone
patterns in their citation, or isolation, form, which we can represent as:(32) Pattern 1 : High on the last mora, Low on all others
     Pattern 2: High on the penultimate mora, Low on all others.
     Pattern3: Lowonallmoras.",[37]
