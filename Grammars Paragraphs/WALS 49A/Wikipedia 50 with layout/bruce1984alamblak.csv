"1.1.2     General fea tures of the A l amb l ak l anguage
       Alamblak is an agglutinating polysynthetic language with some fusional
elements. It is predominately suffixing with some prefixing on verbs and no
infixes .
       The basic word order of the clause is SOV, with some flexibility in
ordering . Most general morpho - syntactic tendencies which are typically
associated with SOV languages (cf . Greenberg 19 6 3 ) are exhibited in Alamblak .
Specifically , case relators follow the noun as enclitics , subject and object
NP ' s are unmarked for case , and an interrogative element is not fronted in the
clause , but it is ordered in the same way that the grammatical relation it is
questioning would be in a declarative sentence (cf. section 3 . 4 ) , and subordinate
clauses usually precede the independent clause ( cf . section 3 . 6 ) .
       There are certain departures in Alamblak from some of the generalisations
made by Greenberg for SOV languages . For example , while the ordering of a
nominal object before the verb is not strict , the purpose clause is not required
to follow the main verb (cf . Greenberg 1 9 63 :84 ) but it occurs as frequently
before the main verb as after it (cf . section 3 . 7 ) . Secondly, while subjects
and objects (both nominal and pronominal) agree with the verb in person, number ,
and ( in third-person singular forms) gender (cf . section 3 . 3 ) , the adjective
does not agree with the head noun for any category (cf . section 3.3 ) contrary
to Greenberg ' s ( 1963 : 9 3 ) prediction .
       In the noun phrase (cf. section 3 . 2 ) descriptive adjectives may precede or
follow the head noun, with the prehead position being the most common . Possess­
ive phrases and relative clauses normally precede the head noun . Only the final
element of the noun phrase hosts inflectional - like categories , so that there is
no agreement system operating within the noun phrase .
       The Alamblak verb ( cf . section 3 . 3 ) i s potentially a highly complicated
polysynthetic unit manifesting various patterns of serialised verb, noun,
adjective , and time word roots .
       The clause is dominated by its semantic role structure although referential
structure does play a minor role in the organisation of the clause . These
notions are discussed both later on in this section and in sections 3 . 4 and 3 . 5 .",[8]

'situational roles ' and refinements have benefited from the work of case grammar .
     Clause-level tagmemes used in the present study are comparable in format
to Franklin ' s four-box tagmeme , with two differences . The first difference is
a terminological one; the term ' categories ' is replaced by ' exponents ' i . e .
the set o f units which expound a given function , following Longacre (1976 : 258ff) .
     Secondly , the functions which qualify as semantic functions are restricted
to generalised semantic roles which are structurally marked in the clause .
Franklin ' s semantic functions of clause-level constituents , on the other hand,
are equivalent to covert semantic case roles as developed, for example, in case
grammar . As already indicated in this section , such specific roles cannot be
specified for tagmemes , which are abstract construction points of a construction
type ( c f . Longacre 1976 : 258) . Precise semantic roles , such as those employed
in case grammar , can only be specified after the individual lexical items are
selected to form the construction . That is , these roles are ultimately features
of semantic specifications of lexical items and not part of an abstract clause
type ( i . e . , construction type) . For example, the specific setting case marker
-n may indicate a time setting or an interior , surface , or adessive location
setting . The precise role of an exponent of the specific setting function is
determinable by the meanings of the lexical items of the clause in conjunction
with a role hierarchy; the role is not part of the specification of the NP type .
The precise role of the S .Setting NP in each clause in example 3 is indicated
by the translations .

            We stood at/*in/*on the headwaters .
        Role structure is still a part of clause structure . Only generalised roles ,
however, are indicated by the structure of the clause . For ·nuclear NP ' s we
employ three generalised roles - Actor, Undergoer, and Object ( cf . A . Hale 1 9 7 4 ) .
The number of roles for peripheral NP ' s varies greatly according to the
particular encoding conventions there are in a given language . Roles encoded
by peripheral NP ' s in Alamblak are discussed in Section 3 . 5 .
        A full specification of the features o f a four-box tagmeme i s frequently
unenlightening or redundant . Hale ( 19 74 : 5 7- 5 8 ) , referring to this fact,
suggests that , ""the degree to which any given tagmeme shows redundancy among
its cell is currently taken as a measure of the peripherality of the tagmeme . ""
More disturbing to the theory is the possibility that there may be no distinc­
tion between grammatical and semantic functions for most constituents . Only
nuclear NP ' s seem to be clearly multi - functional elements in the clause . Thus
the -n case-marked NP ' s in example 3 function simply as specific setting NP ' s .
It would be artificial to postulate two separate terms for grammatical and
semantic functions unt�l such contrasting functions can be clearly motivated .
        It is redundant to specify both functions in many cases even for nuclear
NP ' s . In Alamblak , for example , using the terminology employed herein , the
subject is predictably the actor, the inner object is predictably the undergoer,
and the outer object the object . The distinction between gramma tical and
semantic function is maintained here , however , in view of the evidence that the
subject function is a complex notion . Subject is predictably actor only
because it is by definition a conflation of referential prominence and actor
role . The notion subject is only used where there is a conflation of referential
prominence and actor role . When those two properties are separated, the gram­
matical function of referential prominence (RP) must be used in conjunction
with a different semantic function e . g . undergoer . The specification o f an NP
as both RP and actor ( i . e . subject) is not redundant therefore , since an RP
may also function semantically as undergoer . The four -box tagmeme is retained,
then, largely for the sake of one or two NP types which are nuclear to the
clause . Its usefulness as a descriptive device for all constructions          in the
grammatical hierarchy must be seriously questioned , however . l l
12      There is a fourth feature at the intersection of Franklin ' s parameters of
categories and semantics . This feature identifies semantic features of classes
of exponents which expound a given function . This specification of construction
points ( i . e . tagmer�es) is infrequently used in this work , being information
which is also largely relegated to the lexicon . There are cases , however, where
constructions specify certain semantic features of certain exponents . For
example, nominal exponents of the related nucleus function of the allative NP
(cf . Table 98) are specified as [- animate ] . Thus krn i vi l lage may manifest
the head of an Al Nl' but y i rna person may not, as in example 4 .
4 (a)  •                   Al NP

              we . wi l l . come   person-AL
The referent NP ( cf. Table 94) makes no such semantic restriction on the
exponents of the nucleus function , e . g .
5.                        Ref NP
                                                     i

             we . wi l l . come person- 3SM-REF
             We wil l come to the man .
     The specification of tagmemes as represented by the four -box tagmeme will
be presented in chart form in this grammar , as illustrated in Table 1 . The
grammatical function marked for optionality is followed by the semantic function
in parentheses where relevant . Exponents of the function are listed below the
functions with any required semantic specifications enclosed in square brackets .","[16, 17, 18]"
"2.3.4   The three-central -vowe l hypothes i s as a poss i b l e reconstructi on
     The indeterminacies in many areas of Alamblak phonology can be explained
by viewing the system as a whole and the ways in which it has been changing.
A model which seems to account for the present Alamblak system best is
described as follows : In a proto - , or perhaps pre-Alamblak system a three­
vowel system ( + , a , a ) operated with stringent restrictions on vowel clusters
(perhaps no vowel clusters at all as appears to be the case now with Ndu
languages) . Vowels were separated by approximants (or approximants and glottal
stop as in the case of Ndu languages) . Approximants modified central vowels
producing front and back allophones . In some cases the central vowel and
approximant coalesced whereby apparently independent (unconditioned) front
and back vocoids were produced . In cases where non-central vocoids resulted
from a relatively abstract underlying form through complicated phonological
rules , the final phonetic output was reinterpreted as the underlying form. In
some cases morphemes with this new vowel served as a model for reinterpretations
of other underlying forms . In this way non-central vowels became a part of the
vowel inventory . With a five- or seven-vowel system, vowel clusters then
occurred and consonant clusters were highly restricted (as appears to be the
case in Sumariup , a neighbouring language to Alamblak , where close transition
in Alamblak seems to correspond to a [ + J in Sumariup) .
     As modifications and fusions involving central vowels (especially 1+/)
were reinterpreted as non-central vowels , the functional load of the central
vowels decreased . The most tenuous vowel (/+/) , being phonetically very short,
70began to be phased out of the system. Thereupon allowable consonant clusters
occurred with or without the intervening [ t ] with factors of timing and
emphasis affecting their manifestations . The remaining It/ ' s became a weak
vowel in the system with respect to stress rules and susceptibility to elision
next to other vowels and between consonants which could cluster . This appears
to be the present status of the Alamblak system. Kalam (Pawley : 1966) may
represent a later stage with completely predictable transition vocoids in a
three vowel system with both vowel and consonant clusters moderately restricted .
(Whether or not Kalam can be compared historically with Sepik phonologies is
a matter of debate . )
     Sepik vowel systems are undergoing a general influence which may add to
the tendency toward similar developments in many Sepik languages . The influence
is that of New Guinea Pidgin which is spoken throughout the Sepik area . Its
vowel system consists of primarily front and back vowels ( i , e , 0) as well
                                                                   u ,as central / a / . The influence of Pidgin English is undoubtedly a factor which
gives added impetus to tendencies to phonemicise non-central vowels .
     If such a model is a valid approximation of the general situation, then it
serves as an explanation for the difficulty in determining the status of the
high central vocoid in many instances in Alamblak . It is simply losing ground
in Alamblak phonology . As such it is contrastive only to a limited extent . In
some cases /t/ is distinctive in a word where it contrasts with close transition
in analogous position in another word; in all environments it is the lowest
ranked of syllable peaks with respect to stress placement. Noun-stern-finally
it appears to have tecome regarded as an unnecessary redundancy and therefore
elides next to vowels and between certain consonants .","[75, 76]"
"102 .   Comr ie ( 19 7 9 ) has suggested that definite and animate direct obj ects form
        a natural class . After presenting evidence from a variety of languages
        to support his claim, he offers an explanation for i t . His explanation
        is e ssentially that case marking serves as an overt marking of the differ­
        ence between subj ects and objects rather than a marking for identifying
        subj ects and obj ects independently . His argument seems particularly
        convincing for those languages which mark subj ects and most direct obj ects
        in the same way but distinctively mark definite and/or animate direct
        obj ects . Comrie ' s conclusion is that subj ects are typically animate and
        definite and those direct obj ects which are animate and/or definite wi l l
        b e the mos t l ikely t o b e confused with subj ects and therefore receive
        specific marking to distinguish them from subj ects . Inanimate direct
        obj ects , on the other hand , which are marked like subj ects ( e . g . with
        the nominative form or no case marking at all ) , will be interpreted by
        a strategy which assigns the actor role to the animate NP and undergoer
        role to the inanimate NP . The case here is s imilar in that the animate
        NP in example 3 2 6 is preferentially assigned to an actor role ( comitative )
        and to other roles only where the context so constrains the selection .",[315]
"3.7.3.2     Gen i t i ve case mark i ng
         The genitive case marking on clausal participants i s another means of
encoding the role structure . The general pattern has been discussed in section
3 . 7 . 1 . In general , the noun phrase which is least access ible to verbal cross­
referencing in independent clauses ( according to the actor and undergoer
selectional hierarchies , cf . section 3 . 5 . 2 . 1 ) is the most l ikely to take the
genitive form in dependent clauses . The occurrences of genitive noun phrases
are summari sed for the purpose relative clause , nominal clause and purpose
clause in Tables 41 and 49 ( in section 3 . 2 ) , and in Table 128 , respectively .
The selection of the genitive NP constituent i s not a strict syntactic rule
based on a hierarchy of grammatical relations , since variation can occur .
Usually , however , the genitive will occur on the non-actor if there i s more
than one nuclear NP in the clause . The factors ( e . g . referential factors)
which impinge on the general pattern have not been identified at this stage .
See example of the purpose relative clause , nominal clause and purpose clause
for illustrations of genitive NP ' s in dependent clauses .",[297]

In example 202 the ful l pronoun form manifests the nucleus pos i tion of the
phrase . Al l other forms of non-verbal phrases require non-terminated forms
in that pos i tion . To make pronoun phrases consistent wi th that pattern , pro­
nouns would have to be considered unanalysable (non-terminated ) .
        On the other hand , a pronoun may be a minimal manifestation of a phrase ,
e.g.
203. ret       she/heY'
If the pronoun in 203 is unanalysable , then it breaks the general noun phrase
pattern s ince it manifests a phrase without a terminator .
     There is other evidence relevant to the analysis of pronouns . Copulative
constructions are formed by suffixing the copula -e to a base form . The base
form of pronouns may be identified , then , by examining copulative forms o f
pronouns .
     Th ird person forms ( indirect reference pronouns ) of the paradigm are
analysed d i f ferently than the other pronouns by this test , e . g .

third-person forms , however . Third-person pronouns are analysable into base +
terminator , whereas other pronouns are not analysable , at least in the context
of the copulative construction . The final consonant of third-person pronouns
has been reinterpreted to be a person-number-gender terminator by analogy with
nominals which are also third-person in form . First- and second-person pronouns
have not undergone any such reanalys is .
     Whatever the exact reason for the disparate analysis by Alamblak speakers
of different pronoun forms , what is perhaps both more interes ting and more of
a synchronic problem is the fact that in some contexts third-person pronouns
are treated the s ame as first- and second-person pronouns .
     At present it seems that third-person pronouns have five base forms which
occur in different grammatical environments .

same form as the corresponding PNG markers , occur elsewhere . The pronoun phrase
can be described as hosting terminations in the same way nominal phrases do
with the additional rule that restricts person-number-gender markers from
occurring immediately fol lowing a pronoun base .
     We would l ike for our description to explain why this special rule , and
the special base forms of third-person pronouns , occur in the grammar . The
historical development of person-number-gender markers will be of signi ficance
relating to this question . We will not discuss the origin of person-number­
gender markers in Alamblak in this work , however .","[131, 132, 133, 134]"
"Permutabi l i t y      The outer modifier s lot freely permutes to any position preceding the
nucleus although it is only marginally acceptable preceding the determiner l

the phrase and forms a head-less appositional phrase .

in a post-head position within the noun phrase . In example (b) it is in an
appositional phrase following the first noun phrase .

      Exponents of the outer mod i fier function are the general relative clause ,
the purpose relative clause , the ( non) -possessed modifier , and the possess ive
phrase . Of these outer modi fiers , the general relative clause , the purpose
re lative clause , and the verbal form of the ( non) -possessed modi fier are termed
' embedded clauses ' . Embedded clauses are discus sed and contrasted with sub­
ordinate c lauses in section 3 . 7 .
      Embedded clauses are constituents of constructions on or below the clause
leve l . They contrast with independent c lauses in the fol lowing general ways .
Embedded clauses 1 ) typically have non- finite predicates , 2 ) occur without
actor and undergoer pronominal suffixes ( c f . 3 . 3 . 1 . 2 ) , 3) potential ly incorpor­
ate nouns into the verb stem of the predicate ( c f . 3 . 3 . 1 . 3 ) , and 4) some
embedded clauses potentially exhibit genitive forms of noun phrase s (marked in
the same �ay that possess ive phrases are) for those noun phrases which corre­
spond to nuclear NP ' s of independent c lauses . Independent clauses , on the
other hand , 1 ) typically mani fes t only finite predicates with actor and ,
frequently , undergoer pronominal suffixes , 2 ) tend not to incorporate nouns into
the verb stem of the predicate , and 3) do not exhibit genitive noun phrases ;
nuclear NP ' s are unmarked for case in independent clauses . The syntax of
independent clauses i s described more fully in section 3 . 4 .
106
3.2.3.2.4.1       Genera l rel ati ve c l ause
     The first outer modifier to be discussed i s the general relative clause
which is described in Table 40 . As noted there , the peripheral functions are
the same as they are for independent c lauses . The distinctions between the
three nuclear functions in independent clauses , subject , inner obj ect , and
outer obj e c t , are never completely maintained in the general relative clause ,
however . The reason for this loss of grammatical contrast is that the reduced
form of the verb lacks the pronominal af fixes which identify the functions of
each nuclear NP in independent clauses .
      There are two relativisation s trategies within the framework of the general
re lative Clause . Sub j ects , obj ec ts , and obliques are relativised on wi th a
non-case-encoding strategy . 6 3 This s trategy employs the general relative clause
without manifesting the optional terminator plus relator complex ( c f . Table 40) .
The head noun being relativised on 6 4 is not explic itly referred to within the
relative clause , nor is there any indication of its semantic role within the
relative clause . Of the oblique NP ' s , a comi tative is not relativisable ( c f .
the dis cussion of the c omitat�ve in section 3 . 4 . 2 . 3 which concludes that the
comitative is a conjoined rather than a case-marked NP ) . Neither is the obj ect
of a comparative relativisable .
     The s trategy which employs the relative clause with the terminator plus
relator is used to relativise on the genitive ( i . e . possessor ) of a possessive
phrase . In that strategy the genitive case of the head noun is indicated by
the relator ,     -ho
                   ' genitive ' within the relative clause . These two relativisation
strategies are i l lust:rated in examples 1 7 5 and 176 . Before those examples are
given , we will d iscuss the function slots of the general relative clause and
their exponents in more detai l .","[111, 112]"

          actor and undergoer pronominal markers ( c f . 3 . 3 . 1 . 2 . 1 ) , 2) potentially
          incorporate nouns into the verb (cf . 3 . 3 . 1 . 3 ) , and 3) potentially employ
          genitive forms of noun phrases corresponding to nuclear NP ' s of independent
          clau se s . These features contrast with independent clauses which do not have
          genitivised nuclear NP ' s , and they tend to neither exhibit non-finite verbs
          nor incorporate nouns into the verb , but they do employ person markers . By
          these features , then , the embedded clauses near the top of Table 127 are the
          most sentential . The relative clauses ( including the (non) -possessed modifier )
          and nominal clauses are described i n section 3 . 2 . The others , i . e . the
          adverbial clauses , are described in the next section .
                   The phenomenon of noun incorporation is discussed in section 3 . 3 . 1 . 3 , for
          both independent and embedded clauses . The pattern of genitivisation is
          basically that the nuclear noun phrase which is least accessible to verbal
          cross -referencing in independent clauses is most accessible to genitivisation
          in embedded clauses . Formally , an ergative pattern is followed with subjects
          of intrans itives and obj ects of transitives being optionally marked with the
          genitive ( i . e . pos sessive ) marker . with three-place predicates , the outer
          obj ect ( i . e . ' patient ' noun) is marked wi th the geni tive . I f both the inner
          obj ect ( i . e . ' benefactive ' or ' recipient ' noun) and outer obj ec t are mani fested ,
          the inner obj ect will be genitivised only if the outer object is incorporated
          into the verb , which is the typical case if there are two or three arguments
          extant in the clause . The nominal clause varies slightly from this pattern as
          discu ssed in section 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 6 . 2 . Noun phrases with peripheral semantic roles
          ( i . e . locationals , etc . ) may occur as an outer object in the genitive form if
          one of the two object positions is available . Thus , syntactic doubling of
          genitivised objects i s disallowed .

3.7.2         Adverb i a l c l auses
        Adverbial clause s are a part of the setting of either sentences or clauses ,
i . e . they provide a temporal reference for or indicate the purpose of the main
predication . 1 3 6 Temporal clauses manifest a sentential adverbial function as
readily as they do a clausal adverbial function . The purpose clause on the
other hand seems to function only on the c lau se level .","[292, 293]"

                                    P HO N O LOGY2 .0   I n trod uction
     The following analysis of Alamblak phonology is presented within essentially
a generative framework , although it is eclectic at certain points . The generat­
ive framework is also somewhat eclectic , generally following Sommerstein ' s ( 19 7 7 )
approach more than any other .
     Sommerstein (p . - 1 5 ) compares the classical phonemic approach to phono­
logical analysis witll the modern generative approach and finds them complementary .
An attempt is made in this discussion to use both approaches in the complementary
roles Sommerstein views them as having in phonological description . The phonemic
approach defines the underlying contrasts , which are expressed in terms of under­
lying segments . Then the generative approach specifies the surface manifesta­
tions of the underlying segments . The methodology of phonemic analysis ( follow­
ing Pike 1 94 7 , 196 7 ) has been applied initially to non-alternating morphemes and
then extended to those alternating forms with phonetic variations which do not
result in complete phonemic overlap .
     The phoneme as theoretical construct will be used throughout to represent
                         asegments of surface structure contrasts which are relevant for contrasting
underlying forms . �Ie notion of phoneme as it is used here , however , is not
equivalent to a classical phoneme . It is to be understood as an archisegment
in Hooper ' s ( 19 7 5 ) sense, having a partial phonetic specification . Phonemes
are the component units of underlying ( i .e . base) forms of morphemes . The
underlying forms of non-alternating morphemes are identical to their (pronounce­
able) surface forms , except that all naturally derivable and redundant features
are unspecified .
     Specifying the tmderlying forms of morphemes with alternating forms is
somewhat more complicated . In all cases of alternating morphemes a single
base form will be pOE;tulated , but a- distinction will be made between phono­
logically conditioned and morphosyntactically conditioned alternations .
     For phonologically conditioned alternates abstract underlying forms will
be allowed . The degree of allowable abstractness is constrained by beginning
with Hooper ' s ( 19 7 5 : 555) principle that the base form must consist of ""non-
redundant representations of segments actually occurring in one or more surface
allomorphs ."" We extend this constraint , however , by motivating other abstract
underlying forms in those cases where there is evidence of a conflation of
natural phonetic processes which , ideally , are independently motivated in
other cases involving derivations from more concrete underlying forms . Abstract                                          18
                                                                                 19
forms simply represent those cases of accidental morphological structuring
where the underlying form is not allowed to surface . The abstract portion of
an underlying form can be identified by comparison with other alternating
morphemes which fit into the same paradigm but which manifest the abstract
segment of the form in question in one of their surface alternations .
         Once the basic contrastive units of the phonological system have been
identified and an underlying form has been assigned to each of the morphemes
of the language in terms of those contrastive units , then the phonological
rules are applied to derive a phonetic form for each morpheme or string of
morphemes . Three types of rules will be employed to derive surface forms
from base forms . Phonotactic structure rules will provide the basis for the
operation of certain phonological rules and will operate after others .
Phonological rules describe processes of epenthesis , deletion , syllabification
and coalescence as well as add or change feature values of segments . The
functions of adding or changing phonetic features of underlying phonemes does
the job of the traditional allophonic statement in a phonemic description .
The same type of natural ( i . e . phonetically motivated) phonological rule
will derive the surface forms of phonologically conditioned alternates from
their underlying form.
         For purely morpho - syntactically motivated alternates , the base form will
be that alternate which is least restricted in distribution . Descriptions of
these alternating forms will be included in appropriate sections of the syntax,
since those alternations are not the result of phonological processes . See ,
for example , the description of verb root allomorphs in section 3 . 1 . 1 . 5 and the
discussion of pronominal forms in note 4 5 .
         The approach adopted here i s considerably simpler than the classical morpho­
phonemic approach . Generalities are grasped where they are missed or obscured
by redundancies in a morphophonemic description . At one point in the descrip­
tion , for example , a single phonological rule can be substituted for a morpho­
phonemic rule plus a redundant phonetic rule ( i .e . a classical allophonic
statement) . This situation is yet another example comparable to what Halle
( 1 9 59 ) described for Russian . The morphophonemic rules themselves , which would
be needed to describe alveolar-palatal alternations in Alamblak , would be very
cumbersome compared to the generative approach followed here . See note 1 8 for
some discussion of this point .
         The implications of handling traditional morphophonemics by phonological
rules include the acceptance in principle of complete phonemic overlap, i . e .
 ' intersection ' , in Pike ' s ( 19 67 : 301- 302) terms , or neutralisation in NGP,
(Hooper 1976 : 2 1 ) . While partial overlap (two or more phonemes with the same
allophone in different environments) was acceptable in classical phonemics ,
intersection ( two or more phonemes with the same allophone in the same environ­
ment) was not . Phonemic intersection in non-alternating morphemes ( i . e .
morphemes o f one phonetic shape) i s not permitted in this description; i t will
be permitted, however, in al terna ting forms where those forms give evidence for
it. In principle , partial overlap and complete overlap (intersection) are not
distinguished qualitatively . Both situations arise as a result of natural
phonetic modification of different segments resulting in a surface ambiguity .
Cases of complete overlap must be justified , however , to avoid arbitrary
differentiation of phonetically identical forms . Alternating morphemes provide
a concrete basis for postulating different phonemic segments with identical
phonetic manifestations when they can be derived by a natural phonological rule
( e . g . a rule motivated by Pike ' s ( 1 94 7 : 58) own principle that ""Sounds tend
20
to be modified by their envi ronments . "" ) In this description complete phonemi c
overlap is restricted to cases which can be phonetically motivated by appeal ing
to alte rnating forms .
     For example , given the forms in example 6 below , the [ i ] vocoid in both
forms is non-contras'ti ve and by the clas sical phonemi c method would be assigned
as an allophone of the same phoneme .
6 (a) .     Ifaw i -e- t l [ '�aw i Et ]   It is the mouth of a river.
  (b) .     Iyawy-e- t l [ ' yaw i Et ]    It is a dog .
In other forms of the morpheme ' dog ' it is evident that i t belongs in a paradigm
with other roots whi ch mani fes t a final [ y ] in at l east one of their sur face
forms , e . g . , compare the forms in 7 with those in 8 .
7 (a)   •   Ibuy-e- t l [ ' b UY E t ] It is a bamboo water-carrier .
  (b)   •   Ibuy-tl [ ' bu c ] bamboo water-carrier
  (c)   •   Ibuy -ml [ ' bu ] bamboo water-carriers
8 ( a) .    Iyawy-e- t l [ ' yaw i et ] It is a dog .
  (b) .     Iyawy - t l [ 'y awc ] dog
  (c) .     Iyawy-ml [ ' ya om ] dogs
Fawi river outlet is a non-alternating morpheme and exhibits a different
pattern .
9 (a) .    Ifaw i -e-tl [ '�aw i E t ] It is a river outlet .
  (b) . Ifaw i -tl [ ' �aw i t ] river outlet
  ( c ) . Ifaw i -ml [ ' �aw i m ] river outlets
         The underlying /yl in ' dog ' has interacted with the person-number-gender
marker to produce a palatoalveolar [ c ] ( ex . 8 (b » as in ' bamboo water-carrier '
( ex . 7 (b » . The underlying I i i in ' river outlet ' , although manifested in the
s ame form as the Iyl of ' dog ' in the ( a ) forms of examples 8 and 9 , does not
produce a palatoalveolar PNG marker in example 9 (b ) , nor does it delete in
9 ( c) .
       This problem is not a minor one for Alamb l ak phonology . There are numerous
phonetically alternating mo rphemes to be dealt with . The problem relates
directly to the interpretation o f the phonemic status of palatoalveolar contoids
and non-central vocoids . There is considerable evidence for the coalescence of
y with a lveolars to produce palatals , and approximants (w and y) wi th central
vowels to produce non-central vocoids . There is also evidence that in some
envi ronments both palatoalveolars and non-central vocoids have been as s i gned
phonemic status ( i . e . , are contras tive in underlying forms ) . This is particu­
larly true in non-alternating forms and in alternating forms where reinterpret­
ation is evidenced by an analogical extension of phonemes . The resulting
s i tuation , which seems to be at the beginning stages of phonologi cal changes in
these areas , involves considerable phonemic overlap . Typical ly , palatals and
non-central vowels contrast with other phonemes only in restricted environments .
      Related to the problem of overlap i s the determination of the status of
the h i gh central vocoid , whi ch is equally as problematic as the palatoalveolars
or non-central vowels . In some environments , the mani festation of [ t ] is
phonemical ly s i gnificant ( a part of the underlying structure of morphemes ) ,
                                                                                                   21
while in other cases i t i s analysed a s a n epenthetic vocoid . The sometimes
indeterminate status of the h igh central vocoid is related to a pos s ible
diachronic explanation for i ts pecul i ar pos i tion in Alamblak phono logy . Th is
discussion will involve the question o f vowe l-less words in a wider theoretical
context .
     The problem o f phonemi c overlap and the status of palatoalveolar contoids
and non-central vocoids wi l l be dealt with in the segmental phonology .
     The phonotactic patterns are discussed in section 2 . 2 preceding a section
devoted to the interpretation of the high central vocoid which draws heavily
upon the phonotactics . The final section on intonation covers only bas i c
intonational patterns .","[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"
"3.1 .1      Word cl asses
        Formal word classes in Alamblak are identified by morpho-syntactic criteria .
That is , basic root forms are classed together according to their potential to
host certain bound morphemes . The word classes and subclasses are summarised in
Table 20 .
        Inflectable roots ( i . e . , words) are distinguished from non-inflectable
roots ( i . e . , particles) . Adverbs contrast with all other word classes by their
restriction from hosting the copula and elevational markers . Next , the verb
classes can be distinguished from non-verbals . The internal structure which is
unique to verbs ( e . g . tense , aspect , mood , etc . ) will be discussed i n section
3 . 3 . Non-verbals may be inflected with possessive and emphatic affixes , the
modifier enclitic - s k deteriorated , and the specific setting case marker , and
they may be conjoined by the coordinate conjunction (cf . line three in Table 20) .
        Other subclassifications are possible . Adjectives and some verbs are
similar in that they host the process derivational - t ay (Table 20 line four) .
The deictic-like pronouns , adjectives , personal names , and kin terms of address
contrast with nominals and verbs by not hosting the possessed suffix -et which
may occur with nominals and verbs (line six) . Adverbs are similar to the non­
inflectable particle class in that they may occur as free forms in the clause .
As it will become clear in section 3 . 2 , however , words in all other classes
must be inflected when occurring as a minimal exponent of a clause-level slot .",[79]
"3.4.3.1     Gene ral features
     The three most common nuclear NP ' s in Alamblak are subject , inner object ,
and outer object . These constructs are not understood to be primitive notions
in Alamblak grammar .
     ' Subject ' will be discussed in section 3 . 5 . 2 . 3 as a conflation of several
features . The use of the notion subject is j ustifiable , however , for practical
as well as theoretical reasons .
     The widespread use of the term ' subject ' , with connotations which are more
or less identifiable in a large number of the world ' s languages , makes the term
useful in a language such as Alamblak where a traditional ' subject ' can be
identified in most clauses . Its use here is especially desirable in the case
of scholars who may wish to make cursory reference to Alamblak syntax .
     In contrast to the term ' subject ' , the terms ' direct object ' and ' indirect
object ' as used in traditional grammar can be considerably misleading when
applied to Alamblak syntax.
208     Basic structural patterns of traditional D.O. and 1 . 0 . are coincident with
Alamblak patterns for inner object and outer object , respectively . Namely , the
D.O. in traditional grammar is structurally the s�ne in both transitive and
ditransitive clauses . Similarly , the Alamblak inner object is identified in
one way (by verb agreement) for multiple-place clauses .
     The pattern of mapping semantic case roles onto D.O. and 1 . 0 . , however , is
not the same as the Alamblak mapping onto inner object and outer object. The
semantic case role traditionally associated with D.O. ( i . e . , patient) is the
same for transitive and ditransitive clauses alike . For Alamblak , however , the
roles encoded by inner object are not the same for two-place and three-place
clauses . The differences are diagr�atically represented in Table 100 . 1 0 0                   Tab l e 100 :        Two systems of ro l e encod i ng by obj ects                         Traditional constructs                      Alamblak constructs

      A closed class of about forty-five adjectives is identifiable in Alamblak.
Adjectives are defined as a word class by both positive and negative factors .
      Adjectives are formally distinguished from nouns in that nouns may host
the (non) -possessed markers -et/-doh ra ; basic adjectives do not host these
markers .
      For example , 134 (a) is acceptable but (b) is unacceptable .
134 (a) . met -et      y i ma-r a woman-having man
           woman-POSSD man - 3SM
   (b) . *bro-e t         y i ma - r
            big-possD person- 3SM
        Adjectives and verbs are not so neatly distinguished . A combination of
features will be required to classify certain lexical items as either adjectives
or verbs . Basically , adjectives may generally host a process      derivational
suffix - tay , whereas verbs ( and nouns) generally do not . 4 6 Most verbs and
adjectives may be distinguished on this basis . There are cases of overlap,
where (a) some adjectives do not host - tay , (b) some verbs may host - tay , and
 (c) a few nouns may host - tay . These three categories will be discussed
individually .
        Those adjectives which do not occur with -tay seem to express states for
which there is no process derivative , viz . , t i rf domes tiaated� g ra f wi �
(undomestiaated) � n f r i new , ya tk o ld. A process implies a relative scale ; if
the Alamblak react to the above two oppositions as complement ( in a polarised
opposition) rather than antonym oppositions (opposites on a relative scale)
 (cf . Lyons (1968 : 460-467» , then no relative scale is involved and a process
derivational suffix would be inappropriate .
        In terms of the Alamblak culture it is not difficult to view ' domesticated '
and ' undomesticated' as complements . A domesticated pig is considered undom­
esticated when the owner relinquishes his rights of ownership by giving up
hope of ever regularly exercising that right . In the case of a run-away pig,
the pig did not become wild by some process , it was simply considered to be
outside the sphere of being ' actively owned ' by its former owner (as it were
by a punctiliar act of declaration) .
        The new-old opposition is more difficult to explain . According to Lyons '
discussion and Dixon (1977b : 32) , the opposition involved here would seem to be
one of antonymy ( in the sense explained above) . However , the pair has an
aspect of complementarity as well . While one thing can be newer than another ,
the same thing cannot become newer than it used to be . Since becoming new is
not a possible process , then it does not form an antonym pair with ' old ' in
the same sense that 'big ' and ' small ' do . It is undeniable that becoming old
is a process , but that fact does not need comment since it is a universally
predictable one-way process . The Alamblak do not speak of a process of aging;
they do , however , perhaps more directly , specify aspects of aging as processes
(e . g . beb- tay beaome dearepit� bad ) .
        These four adjectives which do not host -tay are semantically restricted
from taking the process affix . They must be formally classified as adjectives
by other distributional criteria . Though more restricted in distribution than
other adjectives , where they do occur they form a substitution class with the
other less-restricted adjectives . The four exceptional adjectives contrast
,-
78with verbs since they do not co-occur with any of the many verbal affixes . They
contrast with nouns by the criteria mentioned on p . 77 (cf . the example in 134) .
      Category (b) emoraces verbs which may (like adjectives) host the process
affix - t ay . When - tay is suffixed to a basic verb , however , its effect on the
meaning is different than with adjectives . The suffix - tay occurs with state ,
process , and action verbs (cf . Chafe (1970» with the effect of extending and/or
exaggerating a process , e . g .
135 . s i s fen -tay    -w-r     He is panting .
        breathe-PROC- IMPF-3SM
     The semantic effect of the process suffix on adjectives is to derive a
process from a state without any extending or exaggerating effects , e . g .
136 .   b ro-tay   -w    - r    He is getting big .
        big-PROC-IMPF- 3SM
The correct translation of 136 is He is getting big� not He is getting bigger .
      The crucial formal feature distinguishing these verbs which take - tay
from adjectives is simply that these verbs take verbal affixes , as any other
verb does , without xequiring the manifestation of - tay . Adjectives , on the
other hand , do not e:<hibit this flexibility. No adjective may be inflected
directly with verbal affixes . Either the verbaliser - tay or a verbal or
aspectual morpheme must intervene between an adjective morpheme and verbal
suffixes .
      The third category involves nouns which may host - tay . The nouns in this
category are commonly associated with the process derivation , e . g . k i s fu
morning twilight� k i sp dusk� and tah+yt stone . They are distinguishable from
adjectives in that they may manifest the head position of a noun phrase . They
contrast with verbs in the same way that adjectives do .

           It became s tone .
      Approximately forty-five adjectives can be identified according to the
criteria used in the above discussion. The adjectives subdivide further into
five subclasses . This subcategoris""ation involves collapsing two of Dixon ' s
( l977b : 3l ) eight semcmtic classes of adjectives into one formal class (Age­
Human Propensity) .

     The minimal contrast between the physical property subclass and the
dimension subclass is difficult to quantify and may not merit such a fine­
grained subcategorisation .","[82, 83, 84, 85]"
"100 .   Faltz ( 1978 : 76 ) has identified three patterns of encoding the recipient
        semantic case role in the world ' s languages . Alamblak is of the type he
        refers to a s a "" D . O . type of indirect object marking"" . The terminology
        is somewhat confusing here . By ' indirect obj ec t marking ' , Faltz is refer­
        ring to the semanti c case role ( e . g . recipient or benefactive) which is
        generally associated with an indirect obj ect . By this system the recipient
        role is encoded by the same form which is identif ied as direct obj ect in
        transitive clauses . In a ditransitive clause a patient NP ( e ncoded by
        the D . O . in transitive c lauses) typically loses many of its D . O . proper­
        ties .",[315]
"Overt Coreference
     The verbal pronominal suffixes coreference participants which are
identifiable e ither in the l ingu istic discourse or in the si tuational context .
In general there are no syntactic constraints on when verbal pronominal
suffixes may be employed as the only means of referencing the most prominent
participants in a given clause . For this reason most two-place clauses do
not manifest both subj ect and inner object NP ' s in the clause . Often ne i ther
is expressed . There are restrictions , however , with the less naturally salient
participants , i . e . those manifesting orientation roles in the clause . Predi­
cates of case frames 1 and 2 (Table 101) potentially coreference orientation
roles with the undergoer suffix as nuclear roles . The verbal pronominal suffix
may be the sole reference to these participants in a clause only if the noun
phrase which i s coreferenced i s extant in the same clause or an associated clause
of the same sentence . Thus , the sentence unit is the limit of the scope of
pronominal suffixes which are coreferencing participants with orientation roles .
294
      For example , if a location i s identified in one sentence ( e . g . a s ingle
independent clause such as 428 ( a » the verbal pronominal suffix cannot
coreference it in a subsequent sentence ( example 428 (b» . The location NP
mus t be repeated in the next sentence if it is to be coreferenced on the verb
as a nuclear participant ( e . g . example ( c » .

       Thi s constraint on the anaphoric use of the undergoer pronominal suffix
may be explained by Givon ' s ( 1 9 7 6 ) discussion on gramma tical agreement . He
demonstrated the existence of a general implicational hierarchy of types of
NP ' s which are likely to govern verb agreement , e . g .
                            Indefinite obj . ) definite obj . ) subj ect
                                                                                                       295
He argues that such a hierarchy is governed by a ""universal hierarchy of
topicality , i . e . the likelihood of various NP arguments being the topic of
sentences , and more particularly the topic in topic-shift constructions""
(Givon 1976 : 1 5 2 ) . He suggests that three factors interact to determine the
topicality of NP ' s , natural topicality ( e . g . human > non-human ) , discourse
or referential ity ( e . g . definite > indefinite ) and semantic case role prominence
( e . g . agent > dative > accusative ) .
     The hypothesis that verb agreement markers derive from topic-shifted
constructions cannot be pursued here . We have seen , howeve r , that the factors
of referentiality di scussed by Givon are involved in the verbal pronominal
system in Alamblak . The undergoer selection hierarchy ( section 3 . 5 . 2 . 1 )
governs the coreferencing of NP ' s according to semantic role prominence . The
constraints on the scope of the undergoer suffix discu ssed here seem likely to
be related to the natural topicality of NP ' s in a d iscourse . NP ' s which are
locational or temporal settings of a discourse are not usually a focus of
interest in a discourse . Therefore , if they are selected as a focus of interest
and thus marked as a nuclear participant by the undergoer suff ix , they must also
be mani fested by a noun phrase in the same sentence .","[299, 300, 301]"

"3.5.2.2.1        Case frames of s i mp l e verbs
     We wi l l begin our discuss ion by presenting the ma j or verb classes which
range from low in transitivity to high in transitivity . Other predicate types
which fall between the two extremes , and certai n types of participants which
affect the transitivity of the clause , will provide some insight into factors
of transi tivity .
      We are working on the hypothesis that transitivity is a relative notion ,
operating on a continuum rather than a system of discrete categories . I f that
is true , then c ategories , e . g . ve rb c l asses , based on the notion of transitivi ty
are l ikely to be only rough categories with overlap between them . Depending on
the common features which are used as cri teri a for classi fication , verbs do seem
to group into basic classes with an overlap of transitivity features between the
clas se s .
     Verb c l as ses are based on contrasting c ase frames ( i . e . , the semantic roles
of the nuclear NP ' s ass9ci ated with the verb) , and the syntactic potential o f
the verb type t o undergo derivational processes which either add t o o r decrease
transitivi ty . In some c ases subclas s i fications are made on the basis of differ­
ing e ffects of applying these derivational processes to the basic case frame .
       Case frames tend to proli ferate quickly ; Longacre ( 1976) l i s ts 48 logi cal ly
pos s ible verb c lasses based on case frames . Only a sampling of verb types will
be presented here ; even our sample wi l l not be fully speci fied for the
selectional features of each verb type . The selec tional features which are
speci fied are those which are particularly correlated with the syntac tic bas is
of a given verb clas s . The semantico-syntactic frames used here will include
( 1 ) Obl i gatory roles and ( 2 ) optional roles ( in parentheses ) which are diagnostic
to the verb c l as s (being encoded by nuclear NP ' s ) , and ( 3 ) the syntactic form
which encodes them , e . g . actor ( A) and undergoer ( U) verbal pronominal markers ,
outer ob j ect ( O . Obj ) , and c ase-marked noun phrases .
      Modi fications o f these bas i c c ase frames c an be made by syntactic pro cesses
a ffecting the valency of the verb as wel l as by special exponents mani festing
the NP s lots in the clause . These modifi cations will be dealt with separately
in sections 3 . 5 . 2 . 2 . 2 ( causative , benefactive , e tc . ) and 3 . 5 . 2 . 2 . 4 ( inal ienable
pos session) .",[230]
"3.5.1 .1 .2    Path N P
       The path NP is characterised by the path role which it encodes , v. example
299   in section 3 . 4 .
            Path NP      Path role3.5.1 . 1 .3   Referent N P
     The referent case marker is a multifactor case marker encoding five roles
as well as functioning as a comitative conjunction . As such this case marker
is very generalised with little semantic content. It does little more than
identify a referent which is relevant to the predication in some way .
          Referent NP : Adessi ve role with non-motion verbs and a locative
                           head noun
                        Al l a ti ve role with motion verbs

                        Effici en t cause role1 0 1 with an inanimate head noun
                        Point-of-reference role relating a locative noun and
                           another NP
Interpreta tion rules
      Only a partial explanation of an interpretation strategy for the referent
case marker can be attempted here . In general terms , the semantic content of
the participants and/or predicate of a given clause will constrain the possible
interpretations of the referent NP .
      The adessive role is assigned to a locative nominal co-occurring with
non- motion verbs (v. example 300 in section 3 . 4 ) .
      The point-of-reference role relates a locative positional with another NP
(v. example 309 in section 3 . 4 ) .
212
     Most manifestations of the referent N P have potentially vague or ambiguous
interpretations . An ' ambiguity ' implies that a construction has the possibility
of two or more interpretations involving distinct semantic roles . The hearer
must make a choice since the construction must mean one thing or another but not
either or both . By ' vagueness ' it is meant that the construction in question
does not specify one way or the other but may be understood with any of its
possible interpretations .
     One case of vagueness arises when a time word manifests the head of
the referent NP . It may be interpreted either as a simple point-of- reference
or as an efficient cause role . Example 308 ( a) in section 3 . 4 is repeated here
as example 3 2 5 .
325 .   tnd yha - r -pne dbehna-me         -w        -m
        DEM time- 3SM-REF sick - R . PST-IMPF- 3PL
        { At this time they were continual ly sick.
          A t this time and because of i t they were continua l ly sick. }
      The vagueness arising from a sentence like example 325 has to do with
conceptualisation processes . When two events or an event and a particular time
or location are frequently associated together , an observer is likely to inter­
pret the whole situation as involving a cause-and-effect relationship.
      Two cases of ambiguity can be discussed : when a referent noun phrase
exhibiting an animate nucleus co-occurs with a motion verb , and when certain
motion verbs co-occur with certain reference NP ' s exhibiting inanimate head
nouns .
      When a referent noun phrase exhibiting an animate head noun co- occurs with
a motion verb it could potentially be interpreted as comitative , allative , or
elative . If the particular exponents of the head noun and predicate in a given
context do not select a particular interpretation for the referent NP , an
interpretation strategy will operate as follows :
           REF NP : Comitative > Allative > Elative
      For example ,
326 .     Ref NP

The referent NP in example 326 will receive a comitative interpretation unless
the context does not allow it, in which case the allative interpretation will
be chosen, or , as a final option, the elative interpretation .
     Another ambiguous construction results when certain motion verbs co-occur
with certain referent noun phrases with inanimate heads . In these cases , the
referent NP may be either efficient cause , comitative , allative , or elative .

There does not seem to be a conventional ised s trategy for interpreting a sentence
such as example 327 , except that the elative interpretation appears to be the
last choice made .
      I t i s suggested here that example 3 2 6 has a wel l -de fined interpretation
strate gy and example 327 does not , partially because of the nature of the head
noun of the referent noun phrase . In example 326 , an animate NP is a typical
exponent of an actor role and therefore the comitative interpretation which
                                                     0
speci fies the animate NP as actor is preferred . 1 2 In the case o f example 3 2 7 ,
an inanimate noun i s a pos sible exponent for any o f the roles involved i n the
interpretations listed , the re fore no ro le has preference over any other role in
an interpretation strategy .
       In both cases of ambiguity discussed above , the adessive role will be
ass i gned to the head noun of a refe rent NP only i f the context so di ctates .
I f a context happens to be compatible with both al lative and elative interpret­
ations , then the allative role wi l l be chosen . There would seem to be a
practical reason for the preference for allative over elative interpretation .
When changing scenes in a di scourse , for instance , clos ing one scene by tel ling
from where X went is not as important as setting the stage for the next scene
by tell ing to where X went . The latter is essential to the flow of the discourse
whereas the former is optional . S ince the elative ro le is relatively in frequent ,
the allative role wil l be assigned be fore the elative role on the basis of
probability, where context al lows either interpretation .
      The importance of the elative role in discourse in general having been
pl ayed down , there are speci fic predi cates which require an elative role in
their conceptual framework . Thus , verbs l ike fakrme run away and w i kna buy wi l l
interpret a refe rent N P a s an el ative rather than a n allative .
     Al lative and e ffic ient cause roles are automatically selected by the
semantics of certain predicates and arguments . The referent NP in example 3 2 8
can only b e interpreted a s e fficient cause .

"108 .   Example 3 39 i llustrates a general restriction on the inner obj ec t . An
        inner ob ject must be ' crucial to the predication ' ( cf . the definition of
        undergoer p . 2 1 9 ) . Locative and temporal references are not normally so
        importan t , unless they are a point of discuss ion in a discourse and thus
        marked as definite . A noun phrase manifesting an orientation role may be
        marked as crucial to the predication if it indicates a specific referent
        or is marked by verbal aspects so as to emphasise its importance . The
        common verb roh sitting ( case frame 1 ) , if unmarked for adverbial aspect
        will not coreference a non-specific locative inner obj ec t . Thus , *kun- t
        korh-we- r-t ( house-3SF sitting- IMPF-3SM-3SF) , He is in a house, i s
        unacceptable , whereas kun - t kor-has i -w- r-t ( house- 3 SF sit ting CONT . at­
        IMPF-3SM-3SF ) , He is remaining in a house, is much more acceptable . If
        the locative or temporal referent noun phrase is definite or specific , it
        readily as sume s an undergoer function , e . g . nanho kun - t dbehnay- r - t (my
        house- 3 SF siak- 3SM- 3SF ) , He was sick in my house . other semantic roles
        are more natural ly crucial to particular predications and are not so
        constrained , e . g . a patient inner obj ect may be non-spec ific . Case frame
        4 verbs host a locative role obligatorily ; the inherent importance of a
        location to that class of verbs means that a locative inner obj ect need
        not indicate a spec ific referent . The coreferencing of orientation roles
        is considered further in section 3 . 7 . 4 . 2 where constraints on coreference
        between clauses are discussed .",[316]
"1 .4 .1 .4   Seman t i c ro l e s t ructure
       The semantics of the clause is discussed in section 3 . 5 . Semantically
clauses are discussed in terms of a predicate {manifested by a verb) and its
associated arguments (manifested by nominal constructions) . The arguments of
a predicate function with certain roles in the predication .
       The oblique NP ' s (relator-related phrases) are syntactically marked for
fairly specific role relationships which they bear to the predicate . These
roles are categorised as Modal roles and Orientation roles . These categor­
isations are comparable to Fillmore ' s ( 196 8) Modality of the proposition or
Cook ' s ( 1 9 7 2 ) Modal cases or Grimes ' ( 19 7 5 : 119- 1 2 3) Orientation roles . There
is never exact agreement on what to include as roles and how to classify them.
Fillmore ( 19 6 8) includes instrument with his propositional roles ; Chafe ( 19 7 0 )
would relegate instrument to the modality of the clause; Cook ( 19 7 2) includes
instrument , cause , purpose , and accompaniment as modal cases ; Longacre ( 1 9 7 6 )
does not consider comitative to be a semantic role, but insists that instrument
is diagnostic of a class of verbs ( i . e .         neither modal nor orientational , but
nuclear) , and he relegates cause and purpose to the sentence level , the realm
of combinations of predications . A categorisation of roles into modal and
orientation roles is merely for convenience of discussion and is in no way
crucial to the description of the clause .
       The roles of the nuclear NP ' s viz . actor, undergoer , and object , are
directly indicated by the clause structure . The limitation of three roles in
the clause structure and their terminology was inspired by A. Hale ( 1 9 74 ) .
These are termed participant roles because 'participant ' emphasises the crucial
involvement that the referents of these nuclear NP ' s have in the predicated
situation .
       The clause structure assigns only a general role to NP ' s in the clause,
oblique NP 's being typically more precisely indicated than nuclear NP ' s . More
precise role relationships are a factor of the meanings of the specific nouns
and verbs in the clause . The more precise roles will be described for each
6
' case marking ' on oblique NP ' s and as part of the case frames of a representative
set of semantic classes of verbs in Alarnblak for the roles of the nuclear NP ' s .
The case-grarnrnar-type semantic case roles , then, will be discussed in section
3 . 5 , but only as part of the feature specification of lexical items and not as
part of an independent semantic structure of the clause itself .","[11, 12]"
"3.2.1 .1   P h rase l evel
       The noun phrase in Alamblak is analysable into two parts : a base and a
terminating complex of phrasal enclitics . The base consists of constructions
or morphemes such as determiners , quantifiers , modifiers , the nucleus ( i . e .
head) and modifying and limiting enclitics . The phrasal enclitics include
person-number-gender .markers , relators (case marking) , elevationals and
emphatic marker .

according to the features discussed above . Example 149 will be analysed in
terms of those features .

     Pronouns are distinguished as a class essentially negatively according to
affixes they cannot host (cf . especially lines 4-6 in Table 20) . There are
two sets of pronouns : personal pronouns (Tables 21 and 22) and the emphatic/
reflexive pronoun (cf . Table 23) .
     The traditionally unified paradigm of personal pronouns has been divided
into two Tables 21 and 22 . The reasons for making this distinction are discussed

     In general terms , the semantic structure of the clause we are concerned
with here can be described as structured relations which allow the speaker to
identify the role each participant is playing (partiCipant roles) , the relation­
ships of staging elements in the setting to the predicate and/or participants
(orientation roles) , and the means and/or manner whereby the predication is
carried out (modal roles) . The elements of the clause , then , include the
predicate and its arguments which have participant , orientation , or modal roles
in the predication .
     The discussion is organised as follows : each set of semantic roles is
explicated and defined , followed by a discussion of the overt case markers and
case marking systems which encode them. The surface case markers are defined
semantically and rules are postulated whereby each overt marking may be inter­
preted as a specific role .
     It is suggested here that a ' surface ' case-marking system can and should
be semantically characterised . Such a concrete general specification will not
fully explicate the precise semantic roles of NP ' s in most clauses . A more
finely- analysed system of covert role relationships is necessary to complete
the picture . Fillmore ( 1968) emphasised the inadequacy of assigning single
comprehensive meanings to surface case markers since, for one thing, such
meanings could not represent satisfactory semantic primitives . It is contended
in this section , however , that both the overt case-marking system and the
covert system of specific roles have semantic functions and an attempt has been
made to describe them both .",[216]

The di fference between example 367 ( a) and (b) is that a statement about an
inal ienably poss essed item is in some sense a s tatement about the possessor .
In example ( b ) the undergoer is heavy , therefore he is in a patient role being
the entity of which a state is predicated . In example ( a ) the undergoer i s
not heavy , but , in a n affective role , is benefited or malaffected i n some
unspeci fied way as a result of the predication . A syntactic result of this
semantic diffe rence is that a causative form i s possible with an inalienable
possession as a consti tuent of the clause , whereas it is not al lowab le other-

      For any verb comple x , only one actor and one undergoer may be identi fied
since there are only two verbal pronominal markers per ve rb ph ras e . The refore ,
combinations of two or more verb roots must be constrained in such a way as to
al low for , at leas t , the matching of the par ticipants with each verb root and
the iden tification of the ro le relationships that obtain between the participants
and the verb roots . To accomplish such a mUl tiple coding with a minimum of
pronominal markers will obviously require constraints on how many different
partic ipants may occur , and conventions for determining the core ferentiality
of partic ipants when the same participant bears a relationship to more th an one
verb roo t .
      Our discuss ion wi l l be l imited to combinations of two verb roots . Within
this l imi tation the general framework o f coreferencing will be presented by
their basic types wi thout going into the details o f specifying combi nations of
ro les with ve rb types , s ince that has been covered in a previous section .
      Seven basic case frames are presented here which vary according to the
combinations of verb types and patte rns of coreferenti ality of the partic ipants
of the two ve rbs . The basic governing factor of these constructions is that
the complex has one c ase frame as a whole ; one of the actors of the predicates
must be a plaus ible actor for the whole construction and an actor or undergoer
must be interpre table as an appropriate undergoer for the whole . Th is means
that serial roots must have the same actor ( marked as actor on the cons truc tion )
un less one of two different actors may be considered to be the undergoer , such
as the causee in a cause-e ffect rel ationship . There is the same general con­
straint here , however , as with morphological causative constructions , i . e . the
doubl ing of agents is not permi tted . Thi s constraint causes a certain tension
between the degree of agentiveness of a participant and the possibil i ty of view­
ing him as an undergoer of the whole event . Highly agentive actors ( i . e . agents)
cannot be perceived as undergoers , but less agentive actors (e . g . uncontrol led
expe riencers ) can be . There is variation between idiolects in the treatment of
actors which are neither strongly nor weakly agentive , e . g . controlled experi­
encers , whether or not they may man i fest an undergoer function in a serial
construction .
     There is an explanation here for the unusual constraints on morpho logical
causative cons truc tions . In particular , why are c ausative constructions
restricted to basically intransitive verbs? If causative constructions
historically derive from serial verb constructions , and it seems l ikely that
this is the c ase , then the constraint of one actor and one undergoer per
construction provides the answe r . A causer and a highly agentive actor ( s uch
as mani fe sted by multiple-place verbs ) cannot co-occur in the same ' serial '
construction s ince there is only one actor marker with whi ch to re ference the
actor of the construction . The present constraints on causative constructions
follow the same principle of forbidding doubling on agents in a clause , and i t
is likely that this principle derives from a common origin i n serial construc­
tions .
     In the case frames discussed below , the actor bears a role rel ationship
with at l east the first ve rb root . The undergoer typically bears a ro le
relationship wi th the second verb root , al though it does not always do so .
The verb classes re ferred to are those which are summarised on Table 101 .

"3.2.1     Gramma t i c a l l evel s
     The notion of a hierarchy of grammatical levels is basic to the tagmemic
theory of language (cf. the discussion in section 1 ) . There is room for con­
siderable flexibility within the theory , however , as to how many grammatical
levels must be postulated for any given language . Longacre ( 1976 : 26 7 ) suggests
a typical arrangement of levels as follows : 5 3
     l . morpheme
     2 . stem
     3 . word
     4 . phrase
     5 . clause
     6 . sentence
     7 . paragraph
     8 . discourse
     This section will describe three of the grammatical levels in Alamblak ,
stem, phrase-base , and phrase . These are the first three levels involving
constructions (elements with internal gramma tical structure) . The number of
levels at this end of the hierarchy corresponds to Longacre ' s ( 1976 : 26 7 ) ; the
terminology chosen for the levels , however , indicates a merging of the tradi­
tional word and phrase levels . Three levels are maintained , stem, phrase-base ,
and phrase , but all three exhibit features which are characteristic of two or
more of the traditional levels stem, word , and phrase .
     In our discussion we will adopt Pike ' s ( 1967 : 4 3 8 ) defining features of
words along with those discussed by Lyons ( 1968 : 202-204) and Mathews ( 1 974 : l60ff) .
90Features of words include 1) isolability as minimal utterances no part of which
is itself isolable , 2) permutability as units in a sentence , 3 ) rigidity of
ordering of constituent parts , 4) uninterruptibility of constituent parts (unless
a new word is formea by an interrupting formative) , 5) the constituent parts
of words have different syntagmatic functions (which are non-syntactic) from
those in phrases , 6) units are classed as words by analogy with clear cases
where they are otherwise indeterminate .
       Lyons disallows semantic definitions since no definition will apply to
words without also applying to phrases . He also disallows phonological
definitions due to the lack of total congruence of phonological and grammatical
levels and also because of the fact that languages differ as to the matching
they make between the basic rhythm-stress phonological unit and a particular
grammatical level (word or phrase) .
       Features two , three , and four are features of phrases as well as words ,
the difference being only a matter of degree . That is , words typically exhibit
greater mobility as a unit within a sentence than phrases , and they show a
greater degree of rigidity in the ordering of constituent parts than phrases . 5 4
Features five and six can only be used as secondary criteria for distinguishing
words and phrases due to their circularity . We are left with one feature ,
isolability , which provides a fairly clear contrast between words and phrases .
There are problems even with this feature , however , as has been widely discussed
(cf. Matthews 1974 : 160 - 61) .
       It is not surprising that with these defining features , indeterminacy
 ( fuzzy borders) is to be expected between levels as between other units (Pike
1967 : 438) . This may not be a negative factor , however . Given the functional
similarity of words and phrases , a merging of the two levels grammatically
need not be too surprising.","[95, 96]"

section 3 . 4 . 2) or the locative position of a locative phrase (cf. section 3 . 4 . 2 . 3)
identifying a particular spatial orientation of a clause participant or action
of the clause participant to another object or place . They also manifest the
locative position in the locative-complex construction (cf . section 3 . 4 . 2 . 1 )
which fills the nucleus position o f a relator-related phrase . A positional
word is illustrated in example 144 (a) ( boha) as the nucleus of the G . setting
relator-related phrase , in example (b) (yurak) as the locative position in the
locative phrase , and in example (c) ( k i mb) as the locative position in the

     Other basic positionals are restricted to occurring with specific items .
They may occur in a locative complex phrase . Since the head noun , with ref­
erence to which the positional word is specifying a particular orientation , is
predictable , these positionals may occur as the nucleus of a relator-related
phrase without specifying the head noun .

      canoe-3SF-GEN p Zank- 3SF
      the canoe 's p Zank
When they occur as locative positionals in locative constructions , however ,
they are used in an abstract sense . For example , doh-bufa-kor canoe-p Zank-at
means beside the canoe not at the p Zank of the canoe in example 146 .
146 . doh -bufa -ko r wah t t i twa

     Time words are distinguished as a class by their restricted distribution
in relator-related phrases . They only occur with specific or general setting
case suffixes (cf. section 3 . 4 . 2) . There is a similarity here with adverbs
which may host the general setting case marker but no others . This formal
similarity may be indicative of the similar clausal functions of time words
and adverbs (cf . section 3 . 5 . 1 . 2) .
863.1 .2.9.1    Bas i c t i me words
     Basic time words include partitions of a 24-hour period and more general
time-reference words .
     Partitions of t e day :
             dbha              morning
             kr i f            afternoon
             y i fung          night
     General time reference :
             yha               day 3 time
             �r                day      ( literally
                                              sun )
             h ref             today
             y hof             one day removed (= yesterdaY3 tomorrow)
             yuanane           two days removed
     Ma r sun also occurs as a noun. But unlike other nouns , it is also a
temporal word by metaphorical extension and may host the general setting case
marker .
     The partition words may be incorporated into the verb nucleus (cf. the
discussion on incorporation 3 . 3 . 1 . 3 . 4) .
     Two of the time words of more general scope do not occur in the general
setting phrase (cf . section 3 . 4 . 2 . 5) , yha day and yuanane two days removed.
Yuanane is analysed as a frozen form of the general setting phrase (yua-nane)
which cannot further host the general setting marker -nane . Alternatively it
could be analysed as yua two days removed , which is only manifested as the head
of a general setting phrase .","[89, 90, 91, 92]"

The second part of the s trategy means that the le ft-most interpretation which
is compatible with the case-marked noun and the rest of the clause wi ll be
214
chosen as the interpretation of the c ase marker . For example , the specific
setting marker will relate the predicate to the interior of a three-dimensional
ob j ect where that interpretation is compatible with the predicate and partici­
pants in the c l ause . If the ' interior location ' is not compatible with the
re st of the c lause , then the ' surface location ' role wil l be appl ied , etc .

"3.5.2.2.3              Other fea tures of tran s i t i v i ty
     In case-frames one and two , there is only one obli gatory NP . When there
are two ( one man i festing an agent or patient , and another mani festing a locative
or temporal role coreferenced as undergoer) , the undergoer is usually marked as
definite . Thus , the predi cates of case-frame one and two may structurally
parallel other transitive predicates , i . e . increase in transitivity , i f the
inner obj ect is highly individuated . The effect of causativisation on c ase­
frame-two predicates will be di scus sed in comparison with case - frame five .
     Case-frame- three predicates ( e . g . ' heavy ' ) are at the low end of the
transi t ivity s cale . When a predicate of c ase- frame three exhibits only one
participant , it manifests no features of trans itivi ty ; there is only one
participant and it has none of the features of an actor , i . e . is ne i ther
performer , c auser , controller , nor wil l ingly active . This form may be causativ­
ised ( a feature of low trans i tivity ) , whereby the actor is now the causer o f
the state which has a n e ffect upon the undergoer .
     I n some ways case- frame-three predicates have a higher �rans itive factor
than those of frames one and two . When two participants o ccur in underived
constructions with case-frame-three predicates , the second partic ipant h as
features of a higher degree of transitivity than do undergoers in frames ones
and two . The undergoer is affected by the state of the first participant .

The fact that the undergoer in 358 manifests an affective role is substantiated
by the fact that a causative form is not allowed if it adds another participant
in the affective ro le , thus doubl ing a ffective roles . For exampl e , sentence
359 ( a ) is ungrammatical ; without the second affected participant the causative
form would be gramma tical (example (b» .

      The predicates of case- frame three have been termed ' intrinsic s tatives ' ,
in contrast to ' extrinsic statives ' in case-frame one . Intrinsic s tative s
describe intrinsic or non-transi tory features of things which cannot be
associated with particular spatial or temporal settings . There fore they do
not host orientation roles in a nuclear function ( i . e . as inner obj ect) .
Structurally , the inner obj ect position is vacant for partic ipants with other
roles .
     Semantically , a participant described in its intr insic features may be cast
as a force , i . e . a cause of an effect on other participants . Therefore the
structural vacancy may manifest an affective role without recourse to a derived
form ( vi z . benefactive ) , even though the bene factive construction is allowable .
An actor whi ch can be interpreted to be the causer of a predication is also
then a feature of transitivity which charac teri ses case- frame-three predicates .
This is another feature which makes these predicates more transitive than those
of case frames one and two .
        Case-frame-four , predicates ( i . e . ' enter ' ) are transitive to the extent
that they host two obl igatory participants . They are transitive in no other
way , howeve r , as evidenced by the fact that they mani fest de rived causative and
benefactive forms but neither re flexive nor reciprocal forms . The explanation
for these ' intransitive ' characteristics has to do with the nature of the
second participant ( inner obj ect) . It lacks most of the features of an undergoer
whi ch mark a pos i tive degree of transitivity . I t is in no way affected by the
predicate , nor need it indicate a speci fic referen t . I t mani fests only the
weakest feature of transitivity in being the obj ect toward which the action i s
p ro j ected .
      The predicates of case-frame fi ve , ( e . g . ' start at ' ) manifest features o f
transitivi ty and intransitivity to a rel atively equal degree . On the transi tive
side of the scale , they host two obli gatory participants . The actor NP
( uncontrolled expe riencer role ) may be viewed as the performer of the s tate or
event ; the undergoer NP ( re fe rent) is the obj ect toward which the predic ation
is directe d . As a reflex of a certain degree of transi tivity , these predicates
may assume re flexive or reciprocal forms .
        The predicates of case- frame five also manifest intransitive features as
suggested by the fact that they may be causativi sed . At best the actor NP
( uncontrolled experiencer ro le) is a very weak actor , being a pe rformer of the
state or event but possessing no other actor-like features . The undergoer NP
is also a very weak undergoer , being hardly more than a catalyst for the situ­
ation . These experiencer predicates maintain thi s orientation of experiencer
as actor rather than the referent , because the experiencer is considered to be
more of a performer of the action than the referent is a causer of the action ,
( c f . exampl e 3 4 3 ) . The experiencer perspective governs these predicates in a
si tuation which i s very marginal as far as dec iding which of two participants
is to be vi ewed as the actor , i . e . the contro l l ing , initiating, or performing
participant .
     The potential for causativisation has been appealed to as evidence of the
intrans itivity of case- frame- five predicates . Even here , however , these
predicates are mo re transitive-l ike than other causativisable predicates . This
is so because no participants are added by causativisation , a feature which is
unique to this clas s o f predicates . The causativisation process merely
reverses the perspective by viewing the referent as an active cause r of the
predication and the experiencer as an affected obj ect and less of a contro l l ing
performer of the action .
236
        The causative process s t i l l increases trans i tivity , although wi thout
adding participants . Transi tivity is increased by the actor NP becoming a
causer and not merely a performe r , and by the undergoer becoming an affected
ob j e ct and not merely a catalyst or incidental cause of the predication .

      Predi cates o f case- frame five ( i . e . uncontrol led expe riencer verbs ) are
similar to controlled experiencer verbs ( case-frame two ) in terms of the
semantic ro les involved . They di ffer , however , in how they are affected by
causativi sation . Following causativisation , a controlled experiencer verb ( e . g .
' laugh ' ) retains the experiencer role as subj ect , whereas the uncontrol led
experiencer verb ( e . g . ' be startled ' ) encodes the experiencer role in undergoer
function as inner obj ect . Compare the c lauses in example 362 .

      Both predicate types are unique in the way they are causativised . predi­
cate types one , three , and four and reflexive forms of eight and ten add a
participant in actor function when causativised . The uncontrolled experiencers
reorient the predication without adding a participan t . The control led
expe riencers add a participant , but in the undergoer rather than the actor
function .  ( For this reason , class-two predicates are termed ' controlled
experiencers ' , s ince they are encoded as control ling actors in causative
constructions . ) 1 1 0 The experiencer role remains in the actor function with the
features of per former of the action who exerts control over the action . l l l
These predicates presuppose at least a greater degree of control than do the
uncontrolled experiencers ( e . g . ' be startled ' , ' be happy ' , ' be angry ' ) which
portray the expe riencer as undergoer in causative constructions . To this
extent controlled experiencer verbs are more transitive than uncontrolled
expe riencers . Controlled experiencer verbs are less transitive than
                                                                                            237
uncontrolled experiencer verbs , however , by other criteri a ( e . g . the potential
for reflexive and reciprocal constructions ) . The feature of control on the
part of the actor is thus only a weak feature of trans itivi ty ; it c an character­
ise an actor even when it is the only participant in the clause .
     Predicates of case-frame-six (perception verbs ) are the firs t o f the fully
transitive predicates , according to s tructural and syntactic criteria . That is ,
two obli gatory participants occur in underived forms , and the verb may not be
causativised but may have re flexive or reciprocal forms . According to our list
of semantic transi tivity features , howeve r , this class only manifests a low
degree of transi tivity . The actor NP is perhaps the performer , exerting some
control but it is not an active causer of the predicate . The undergoer NP is
only potentially affected , but typically nothing more than a catalyst which
enables the predication to be completed .
      Predicates of case-frame-seven ( e . g . ' pierce ' ) are the transi tive set par
excel lence . There are two obl igatory partic ipants . The actor NP is typically
a controlling causer who is active in the predication ; the undergoer NP is
typically an affected object toward which the action is pro j ected .
      Predicates of case-frame eight ( e . g . ' bathe ' ) are clearly trans i tive with
some intransitive features . That is , the reflexive construction occurs without
the emphatic/reflexive pronoun t u which typically occurs in re flexive construc­
tions of other predicate types . Secondly , the undergoer function , which i s not
employed in other reflexive constructions , may hos t locative or temporal roles
with the reflexive use of the verb . Only the least trans i tive predicate types
( case-frames one and two ) have the potential to host orientation roles as
nuc lear participants . Because o f this feature , the reflexive forms of these
predicates are analysed as being as bas i c as their transi tive forms , hence the
label ' re flexive action-process verbs ' . Examples in 3 6 3 i l lustrate the
re flexive form with an orientation role mani fested in the periphery ( a) and in
the nucleus of the clause (b) .

The high probability of these verbs being in a reflexive form i s one reason
that a second participant ( locative or temporal re ference) may manifest the
undergoer function without much chance of ambiguity ( interpreting the undergoer
as either an orientation or a participant rol e ) .
     Predicates of case-frame nine ( e . g . ' rub ' ) are simi lar to refl exive verbs
of case-frame eight in that they host an affective role and thus c annot take
a benefactive form.
     Case-frame nine di ffers from c ase- frame eight in certain ways as wel l .
For example , the trans itivi ty factor is higher since it potential ly hos ts a
2 38
third nuclear participant . Furthermore , the undergoer marker cannot corefe rence
an NP with an orientation role in reflexive forms due to the role hierarchy for
unde rgoer selection , which restricts orientation ro les from the undergoer
function when a patient role potentially may occur in the undergoer slo t .
       Predi cates o f case-frame ten (e . g . ' put ' ) are highly transitive with a
potential for three nuc lear participants . When the third participant ( locative )
is mani fes ted as a nuclear participan t , i t may occur as inner obj ect ( undergoer
function) thus superseding a patient role , which is higher on the ro le hierarchy
for selecting the undergoer function ; the patient then occurs as the outer
ob j ect . This is permi ssible only because the locative role coalesces with the
affective role , which supersedes a patient for the selection of undergoer . The
affe ctive role with an inanimate location indicates a total ( in contrast to a
partial ) affect of the re feren t . This feature o f total a ffect of the undergoer
is one of the features of high transitivity suggested by Hopper and Thompson
( 1980) .
      The semantic contrast between sentences having the locative role
amal gamated with a ffective as an inner obj ect and those with the locative role
as a peripheral c ase-marked NP is i l lustrated in example 349 . An animate
location in the affective role indicates affectedness ; in a locational role
unaf fec tedne ss is impl ied , as i l lustrated in example 364 .

      P redi cates of case-frame eleven ( factitive ) are transitive predicates
which cannot be reflexive . A transitive action which cannot be re flexive
sugge sts a strict maintenance of the transference of action by keeping the
participants distinct , thus man i fes ting a high degree of transi tivity .
      The predicate of case-frame twel ve ( ' give ' ) is listed as the highest in
transit ivity in Table 101 . The reason for this placement i s the combination
of h aving three nuc lear participants and the constraint against deriving a
reflexive form .
     Although Table 101 does not exhaus t all of the verb types in Alamblak , i t
does i l l ustrate the range of transitivity among Alamblak predicates . Our
discussion has focussed on some of the features involved in transi tivity .
Other verb types combine the features dis cussed above in various ways .
Ultimately the full spec ification o f verbs must be left for the lexicon .
         The e ffects of inalienable pos sess ion in the clause wi ll be discus sed
next .
                                                                                                  2393.5.2.2.4      Syn tact i c i n a l i enab l e posses s i on
      The discussion of transitivity thus far has focussed on selectional
features of verbs and how certain derived constructions modify basic case
frames of verbs . The selection of clause constituents themselves may also
modify the basic case frame of predicates . In particular , the selection of
an inalienably -possessed item will affect the case frame of a verb since its
presence automatically implies the presence of another entity ( the possessor)
which is inextricably involved with the possessed item. Given the necessity
of a second entity , a role may be assigned to it in the clause , either as
affective or referent.
      An inalienable possession in Alamblak is an item which is thought to be
an integral part or possession of an animate being. Specifically , these items
include body par ts , names , and odours .
      Predicates of case - frames one (e . g . ' die ' ) and three ( e . g . ' heavy ' ) may
select inalienable possessions as actors ( force role) . Case - frames five (e . g .
' be startled ' ) , six ( e . g . ' see ' ) , and seven ( e . g . ' pierce ' ) may select
inalienable possessions as undergoers or objects ( i . e . inner objects or outer
objects) in a referent role . Case frame nine (e . g . ' rub ' ) may select               inalien­
able possessions as undergoers or objects ( in a patient role) . 1 1 2
      The case frames of basic classes one and three thus modified by the
presence of an inalienable possession have the form :

possessed item. Clauses with items of inalienable possession, with the
possessor as patient role (case - frames one and three) , occur in the following

       The pattern of verbal cross-referencing exempli fied in example 365 ( d)
indi cates that the verbal person marker sys tem encodes participant roles in the
cl ause and is not simply a concord system ; the partic ipant which is coreferenced
as undergoer is not an independent clause constituent but rather is embedded as
a possessive phrase in the NP which is coreferenced by the actor marker on the
verb .
       The clauses in example 365 contrast with those which man i fest alienable
possessions in the clctor ro le . In those cases the possessor cannot be
coreferenced as undergoer ; in fact , it cannot be a nuclear NP , unless the
construction is in a derived causative or benefactive form . Compare examples
365 ( b ) and ( d) with 366 ( a) and ( b ) .

     This modi fied frame contrasts a patient role with the affective role o f

     The dependent infinitive clause functions as a complement of the main verb
in the matrix clause as in example 415 . The infinitive verb signals the comple­
ment function without the aid of complementiser particles or other subordinators .
As with other embedded clauses clausal arguments may be incorporated into the
verb or genitivised (cf . sections 3 . 3 . 1 . 3 and 3 . 7 . 1 for discuss ions of these

     In lieu of a systematic analysis of Alarnblak discourses in this study , the
other functions of the infinitive clause will be illustrated here . The infini­
tive form is u sed as a paragraph or discourse topic sentence in all type s of
discourse genre as in example 416 .

     The infinitive clause i s frequently emp loyed i n procedural and hortative
discourse genres where tense reference is incidental and often the participants
are secondary to the event being described . Use of the infinitive is one
strategy for reducing the prominence of the actor , much as the passive does in
other languages ( example 4l7 (b » .
4l7 ( a )    •                                                      INF CL

                 Having cut up the meat,         (it) is eaten .
These uses of the infinitive in independent c lauses employ the same form as in
its dependent complement use . Pragmatically , the work it does of focussing on a
tenseless event or state is accomplished well in both cases .
     The purpose clau se , a subtype of the infinitive clause , also functions as
a complement in a matrix clause . I t is discussed along with adverbial clauses
in the next section .
     Many cases of complementation in Engl ish are equivalent to dependent
clauses manifesting a function within the noun phrase in Alamblak . Thus the
nominal clause ( v . section 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 6 ) manifesting the nuclear function is used
in Alamblak for constructions such as , ' hi s going to school ' in ' I desire his
going to school . ' A relative clause (v . section 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 4 ) or a direct
quotation ( cf . the Quotation sentence in section 3 . 6 . 2 . 2 ) or a j uxtaposed but
intonationally integrated copulative c lause ( cf . section 3 . 3 . 2 . 1 ) may be
employed in A larnblak for ' that ' complements in English , e . g . ,

     Dependent clauses have been described in section 3 . 6 . 2 under coordination
and subordination . In this chapter other dependent clauses which are typically
not sentence constituents are discu ssed . These , call ed embedded clauses ,
include time clauses , relative clauses , the purpose clause and nominal clauses .
The di scuss ion will include a description of syntactic and semantic s tructur�s
as well as a section on coreference between c lauses .","[289, 290, 291]"
"Dependent cla uses
      Noun roots may be incorporated into the verb stem of the predicates o f
relative clauses , ( non) -possessed modi fiers , ( c f . section 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 4 ) , and
nominal clauses ( c f . section 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 6 ) . Incorporated nouns are not res tricted
to a particular c lass as they were when incorporated in predicates o f independent
c lauses .
     General ly , subj ects of intransitive predicates , and objects of transi tives
may be incorporated . NP ' s with peripheral semantic roles ( e . g . locative s ) may
be incorporated also .
      Nouns must be generic or non-specific to be incorporated in Alamblak . This
restriction derives from both the syntactic e f fects of noun incorporation and
the pragmatic constraint allowing only commonly associated roots to serialise .
The syntactic e ffec t re ferred to is that the incorporated root cannot manifest
the person-number-gender terminator (a deictic feature of almost all other noun
phrases ) , nor can it be core ferenced by the verb agreement sys tem . In effect ,
the il locutors are deprived of powerful syntactic c lues for identifying the
referent of an incorporated noun . In the case o f inalienably pos ses sed NP ' s ,
the problem of the identification o f the referent is minimal even without those
deictic clues . I t is for that reason that inalienably possessed NP ' s are
readily incorporated . S imi larly , there is no problem of referent identi fi cation
when gene ric or non-specific things are being talked about . Therefore the loss
o f PNG marking and verbal cross referencing does not unduly impair communi cation .
Pragmatical ly , the occurrence of a generic NP with a verb almost automatically
implies a commonly occurring state or event ; it is therefore the easiest type
of noun to use to ful fill the general constraint of conj oining commonly
associated e lements in a serial construc tion .
      I t is important to emphas ise that the primary constraint is the pragmatic
one which restricts serialisation to commonly associated elements . The con­
s traint res tricting mos t cases of incorporation to generic or non-specific
nouns is secondary rather than primary . Not all cases of incorporation involve
generic or non-specific nouns ( e . g . incorporated inalienably possessed items ) .
172
The cons traint o f common association , however , not only explains the fact that
generic and non-specific nouns are most commonly incorporated , but it also
expl ains the variation in acceptabili ty and frequency of occurrence of incor­
porations of various body parts with certain verb roots . Mefha-ka head-eat
(= headaohe) is a cOlrumon seriali sation since , although virtually any part of
the body can be a source of pain , the head is a very frequent one . Serialisa­
tions l ike example 2 5 4 (b) , however , are not readily accepted by all Alamblak
speakers . Too many things can be cut and one is no more l ikely than another to
be associated with this frequent event .
       The ( non ) -possessed modifier is particularly oriented to characterising
an NP by a typically occurring state or event . With that primary function , the
( non) -possessed modifier is often preferred for noun incorporation to other
relative clause forms . Sentence 256 ( a) is quite acceptable but (b) with the
imperfective aspect is somewhat better , and Alamblak speakers clearly prefer
the ( non) -possessed modi fier in ( c ) to either (a) or (b) .

One or another clause in example 256 may be selected for reasons which have
noth ing to do with the incorporated noun root ( e . g . example ( b ) imp lies that
the man no longer spears turtles ) . It is suggested here , however , that assuming
appropriate contexts for each sentence , the ( c ) form is the most preferred
because the incorporated noun is generi c , and (b) is better than ( a ) because
the noun may be interpreted equal ly wel l as e ither a generic or a speci fic ,
whereas the noun in example ( a ) clearly favours the specific interpretation
over the generic one . We conclude , therefore , that nouns used in a generic
sense are preferred for incorporation .
     In a s imilar way , purpose relative clauses and nominal clauses are commonly
employed for reporting generic si tuations .

      In our discuss ion of noun incorporation , we have discussed several factors .
The bas i c contro l l ing factor , a functional constraint on all serial construc­
tions , is that only commonly as sociated elements may be encoded by serial
constructions . With incorporated nouns , the noun must be commonly associated
with the predicate in real world events . Only classes of obj ects ( generics and
non-speci fics ) , vis-a-vis unique individuals and speci fic obj ects , can form a
                                                                                               173
common associ ation with states or events meeting the general constraints on
serial constructions . Thus , the observation that most incorporated nouns must
be generic or non-specific is an e ffect of the general constraint on s erial
constructions rather than an independent syntactic constraint on noun incorpor­
ation .
     We have also noted that noun incorporation in Alamblak is more common in
dependent clauses than in independent c lauses . This i s not an independent
arbitrary constraint either . I t has been suggested by Frantz ( 19 7 1 ) that
incorporation has the e ffect of shi fting the focus to the pos sessor in the
case of incorporated body parts . In other words , an incorporated noun is back­
grounded in the situation vis-a-vis other participants in the cl ause . A reflex
of this e f fect is that incorporated nouns are not inflected for person , number ,
and gender , nor can they be coreferenced by the verb agreement system (which
signals a role relationship between NP ' s and the predicate ) . Given that back­
grounding is a function of incorporation , it is not an independent constraint
that noun incorporation is much more frequent in dependent clauses than in
independent clauses , s ince dependent clauses are semantically backgrounded

       The noun phrases discussed here may be considered to be those bearing
non-nuclear grammatical relations to the verb in the clause . 9 9 It is easier
to associate these NP ' s with specific semantic roles than it is with nuclear
NP ' s (cf. section 3 . 5 . 1 , role structure) .
       An overview of relations encoded by the peripheral ' relator - related '
phrases is given in Table 87 .
       Several of the ' case ' enclitics may encode more than one meaning. Specific
rules for encoding or interpreting the appropriate meaning are discussed with
each phrase . For exan�le , the adessive NP plus a motion verb encodes ' to ' as
its meaning; with a non-motion verb , the adessive NP encodes ' at ' as its meaning.
       The peripheral NP ' s structurally group into three types depending on the
presence or absence of terminator slots and/or their ordering relative to other
function slots . Table 88-90 present an overview of basic structural contrasts
between peripheral NP ' s . Exponents of the terminator function are person-number­
gender markers ( cf. Table 34 , p . 96) . The emphatic and elevational markers are
explicated in sections 3 . 2 . 3 . 1 . 2 and 3 . 2 . 3 . 1 . 3 .

     There is no general strategy for interpreting the precise role o f the
instrument case . The fact that ambiguities exist is i tsel f motivation for the
different roles . Example 3 3 2 i l lustrates ambiguity between di rect and indirect
instrument .

                           y means of tongs .
The first translation o f example 3 3 2 suggests a direct use of the tongs ( such
as by picking up pieces of money from within a clay pot ) . The second trans­
lation suggests an indirect use such as by making and sel l ing decorative tongs .
216
     Example 3 3 3 i llus trates ambiguity between direct and manner ins trument
roles .

        Having gotten a dog
                            l with his j hand(s)
The first translation of example 333 is appropriate for the manner instrument
interpretation where the ' hands ' referred to belong to the dog which the agent
took ahold of in some unstated way ( in contrast to taking ahold of his tai l ,
ears , or hind legs , etc . ) . The second translation is appropriate for the
direct instrument interpretation where the ' hands ' referred to are the hands of
the agent whereby he grasped some uns tated part of the dog ( in contrast to
picking him up wi th some other ins trument such as a net) .
     Our discussion of the orientation and modal roles has associated these
roles with case markers of peripheral noun phrases whi ch typically encode
them. These roles , however , may be mani fested as nuclear noun phrases of the
clause as wel l . Orientation roles , in general , may be mani fes ted by the i nner
and outer obj ect NP ' s . Of the modal roles , ins truments may be manifes ted by
the subject NP . The manner role may occur as an unmarked adverb ( but it c annot
be coreferenced in the verb) . Participant roles , as we shall see next , are
typically mani fested by nuclear noun phrases .","[221, 222]"

       The remainder of the numeral system is described in Appendix B. With the
additional constructions described there , the numeral system theoretically has
the potential of for ing any numeral . In practice , however , only a limited
number of digits are formed in this system. The level of acceptable efficiency
of the system seems to include numerals 1-10 and then by tens to forty . The
greates t operating e fficiency is in the 1-5 zone . Higher numerals are frequently
expre ssed in the New Guinea Pidgin system . I t is certainly the case that
numerals other than those mentioned would not be formed in the vernacular
system as quantifiers in a noun phrase . Higher numerals in the vernacular
system would only be used for counting or tallying . Other counting systems ,

"17 .   Thi s formulation essentially postulates an archis egment whi c h is even less
       speci fied than the ' phoneme s ' in the distinctive feature matrix ( Table 3 )
       to specify the underlying forms of non-alternating morphemes f itting the
       structural description of the rule . To avoid distinguishing thi s Praguean-
298
       type archiphoneme from other archisegments ( i . e . unpronounceable under­
       spec i fied segments ) the phonemic symbol Inl will be used to represent the
       cases of the underspecified [ + nasal ] segment as well as the alveolar nasal
       segment which is also underspecified but to a lesser degree . The potential
       ambiguities of this double service of Inl are resolved in all cases by
       phonetic transcriptions of the forms involved .
       Thi s formu lation was chosen to describe the data instead of postulating a
       more speci fied underlying nasal in order to catch something of the syn­
       chronic s tate in its diachronic context . Some evidence is given in
       section 2 . 1 . 1 . 3 for prenasali sation in Alamblak . If the cases described
       by the NA rule are remnants of prenasalisation , then the results of
       resegmentation diachronically are better described in terms of a neutral­
       isation through limited distribution rather than by positing a single
       arbitrary underlying nasal segment . In thi s cas e , then , the class of
       phones represented in the first environment of the rule ( non-f ront , non­
       nasal , voiced stops) is a natural class which are slower to completely
       lose the feature of prenasalisation diachronically than are the front ,
       voiced or voiceless and non-front , voiceless stops . The voiceless
       affricated palatoalveolar s top is the exception to that generalisation .
       It may be pos s ible to j usti fy including the voiceless palatoalveolar s top
       within that generalisation by claiming that i t loses prenasalisation s lower
       than other voi celess , non-front stops . It is also possible to r emove i t
       from the rule here and account for the phenomenon b y another phonological
       rule where , in the case of palatal ass imi lation , it could easi ly motivate
       pos iting an underlying Inl in the se cases . Such a solution would require
       postulating fully abstract forms for non-alternating morphemes however ,
       and thus i t has been rej ected here .","[303, 304]"

participant roles , vi z . , subject , inner obj ect and outer ob j ec t . The encoding
of participant roles in a clause is one of the maj o r functions of these three
nuclear constituents ; other functions are discussed in section 3 . 5 . 2 . 3 . The
verbal pronominal markers , which are largely responsible for identifying the
nuclear NP ' s , are speci fically the indicators of the roles of the subj ect and
inner ob j ect and , by inference , the outer obj e c t . The verb agreement markers ,
therefore , wi l l dominate our discussion of the case marking system which encodes
the partic ipant roles . They may be semantically characterised as general frame­
works or general ised ro le indicators within which specific roles of nuclear
participants of the clause can be predicted by the class of the verb in the
predicate .
     The first agreement suffix on the verb , which coreferences what has
tentatively been described as the subject , mani fests an actor function . 1 0 4
The second agreement suffix , which coreferences the inner obj ect , mani fests an
undergoer function . These functions will be defined shortly . The third
nuclear NP , the one which is not coreferenced on the verb , mani fests the ob j ect
function .
     The terms "" actor"" and "" undergoer"" are adapted from A . Hale ( 19 7 4 ) . Hale ' s
third role is termed the "" si te "" . He never expli citly associates his roles with
the grammatical relations of subject , direct obj ect and indirect obj ect ,
although the parallel is obvious .
        Hale has res tricted his role.s to de fining relationships ""wi thout incorpor­
ating elements which s hould actually be analysed as parts of the meanings of
individual lexical i tems "" (Hale 1974 : 61 ) . The system of semantic roles he
devises is perhaps the leas t abstract yet propos ed . More abstract role systems
pro li ferate the number of roles by making finer distinctions between them ,
e . g . Longacre ( 1 9 7 6 : 2 5 ) has compared nine case role systems which vary from
three to fi fteen roles . Longacre ( 1976 : 36 ) s uggests that s tructures o f differ­
ent degrees of abstractness do coexis t and that they ""correspond to varying
goals and applications of theory "" . ! 0 5

3.5.1 .3.1           Actor person marker
        The first pronominal suffix on the verb functions to designate the actor ,
i . e . A ( ct ) , in the si tuation predicated by the clause . The actor func tion may
be defined as the participant which may be thought of as the causer or performer
o f , or at the least the entity whose state is predicated by the predic ate .
                     Actor person marker :                Agent
                                                          Force
                                                          Control led experiencer
                                                          Uncontrolled experiencer
                                                          Experiencer
                                                          Patient
      The actor marker can serve to encode agent , force , experiencer , controlled
expe rience r , uncontrolled experiencer , and patient roles which vary in the
degree to which they may be thought of as being performers or causers of a
predication . Di f ferent agents may vary along the same l ines as we ll , indicating
that the semantic case roles are not primitive notions . 1 0 6 This variab i l i ty
will fi gure in the discuss ion on features of trans itivity in section 3 . 5 . 2 . 2 .
      There is a neutralisation in the ac tor function between typical agentive
roles and the non-agentive patient role in intransitive type predications .
This neutralis ation is typical of mos t languages which do not di fferentiate
thes e roles in one-place predications .
      Example 334 i l lustrates the different roles which are encoded by the actor
pe rson marker coreferencing a nuclear NP in the clause .

      The configuration of terminator plus peripheral encl itics indicated in
Table 3 3 is diagnostic of the general noun phrase versus relator-related ( i . e .
relator-ax i s ) noun phrase types . The addition of a relator ( case marking) in
varying configurations with the terminator forms a structural bas i s for
pos tulating three types of relator-related phrases . The relator-related phrases
will be discussed separately ( as distinct from the noun phrase ) s ince they
contrast in form and function with the non-ease-marked noun phrase . They are
discussed in the ir peripheral functions at the clause level in section 3 . 4 .","[101, 102]"
"3.7.3            Ro l e s tructure of dependent c l auses
      Embedded c lauses ( Table 1 2 7 ) , adverbial c lauses , and two subordinate
clauses (viz . the truncated clause and the infinitive complement) lack semantic
ro le encoding suffixes on the verb . The roles of the participants of the
clauses , therefore , must either be identified in some other way , or they must
remain unmarked requiring interpretation according to context . In general ,
the role encoding systems in these clauses will not be as precise as that of
independent c lauses ; more cases of structural ambiguity are allowed in
subordinate c lauses where there are potentially more contextual clues for
identifying the roles of the participants . There are three mechanisms for
encoding role structure in these clauses , word order , genitive case marking
on nuclear participants , and rules of coreference between the actor participants
of the dependent and independent clause .",[296]

about the identity of participants in a particular situation . A preliminary
hypothesis is that the post-nuclear pos i tion is a pos ition of emphasis or
clarification . It is not always poss ible to identify a particular semantic

Example 165 occurs i n a di scourse where all of the fire-s tarting bamboo str ips
had been used up in trying to start a fire . Then another bamboo strip was
tried , thi s time one from a bow ( designated by the phrase in example 1 6 5 ) . The
order of elements in 165 avoids a possible amb iguity which would result from the
unmarked order ( Table 36) . With the pronoun preceding the pos sess ive phras e , i t

The structural description in example 166 would give a mi sleading meaning in the
discourse . The phrase in 166 refers to a bamboo s trip ( unspec ified in the
nucleus ) of another bow ( implying that at least two bows were involved) . The
phrase in 165 does not refer to a d i fferent bow , but only to a d i fferent bamboo
strip , which i s taken from a bow .

the base of a noun phrase . In general , a fully mani fested base (all s lots
manifested) is extremely rare , presumably for styl istic and processing reasons .
Noun phras es most frequently occur with two s lots manifested . One or three
slots are less frequent combinations , and the occurrence of more than three

equivalent in grammatical or pragmatic function . The comitative NP is c learly
not an autonomous peripheral phrase . It is closely related syntagmatically as

      The relationship between two NP ' s related by the comi tative marker is
semantical ly comparable to that between NP ' s linked by a coordinate conj unctio n .
As w e wi l l s e e i n sec tion 3 . 5 i n both cases the NP ' s are coreferenced o n the
verb as a compos i te unit functioning together in a single semantic role (e . g . ,
as agents or patients , etc . ) , as in examples 204 (b) and 205 ( d ) . According to
other syntactic proc esses , however , these two constructions contrast in prag­
matic or grammatical function . While the coordinate NP functions as a gram­
matical unit ( e . g . as sub j ect or obj ect) , the NP ' s related by the comitative
do not function as equivalent participants . The full s igni ficance of the
similarities and differences between the coordinate and comitative NP ' s is
best discussed in the context of the clause uni t , where they function ( c f .

Gender :      Two genders , masculine and feminine , are speci fied by third-person singular
forms . Nouns are not subclassi fied on the basi s of gender since only a small
set of roots must host one gender suffix or the other , being semantically
speci fied as either masculine or feminine . This set includes names of individ ­
uals , or natural ob j ects which ( according to local folklore ) originated from
human individuals , e . g .    mar-r

     Most noun roots , on the other hand , being semantically neutral wi th respect
to sex , may hos t either gender suffix . These roots are of two types , those for
whose referents sex is significant and those for whose it is not .
        Noun roots for which sex is significant always select gender markers on
the basi s of sex . They include roots which refer to humans and higher animals ,
e . g . dogs and pigs . For example ,
-t (yimat                                  yima
                                            person wi l l select
             woman ) depending upon the sex of the referent .
                                                                             -r (yimar
                                                                        man ) or       For many noun roots sex is irrelevant , e . g . roots which refer to inanimate
ob j ects ; for many others sex reference is neither immediately obvious nor
culturally impor tant . These noun roots select one gender marker or the other
as their semantically unmarked form on the basis of a secondary or extended
meaning of the gender markers . Specifically , the mascul ine suffix                 (-r)
                                                                                may be
used to refer to tal l , or long s lende r , or narrow ob j ects ; the feminine suffix
(-t)   may be used for typically short , squat , or wide ob j ects .
       Inanimate roots which host the feminine suffix in their ' unmarked ' form
include terms for house , s tool , the ground , fighting shield , and trees which
are typical ly relatively shorter and more squat than other trees . Those
hosting the masculine suffix in their ' unmarked ' form include terms for arrows ,
signal trumpet , typically tall s lender-growing trees , large string bag varieties ,
e tc . Animate roots which hos t the feminine suffix in their ' unmarked ' form
include terms for turtl e , frog , insects , short snakes , e . g . death adder , etc . ;
those which host the masculine suffix include terms for fish , crocodile , and
long snakes .
       Noun roots which have a semantically unmarked form with respect to gender
also have a ' marked ' form . When a noun root hosts which is for it the
semantically marked gender suf fix , that indicates its re ferent is either
atypical as to s ize or , i f it is animate , the sex of the ob j ect is in focus .
Thus   kun-r house with a masculine rather than the usual feminine suffix
indicates that the house is an unusually long one , and                  nerwi-r
                                                                     s lit gong drum
with the ' marked ' masculine suffix indicates the drum i s unusually slender ,
which implies it was made incorrectly and does not sound good . On the other
hand ,  bar+y-t hornbill with a feminine instead of the usual masculine suffix
indicates , perhaps , that the feminine sex of the bird is in focus .
        There are exceptions to the general pattern in which the unmarked gender
seems to be arbitrarily assigned . For example ,           doh-t
                                                          oanoe is morphologically
feminine in its unmarked form , but it is typically masculine-l ike in dimensions ,
i . e . long and s lender .    B+ndhor-t
                                      oassowary is also usually feminine but is
the largest of the birds although typically quite stout .                   Mahu-r
                                                                     (a kind of
fruit-dove ) is masculine , but the most squat of doves .

Indefini te reference :      Given that the gender system is regular and obligatorily a part of an NP
in third singular forms , conflicts are bound to arise in situations in which
the speaker is either unable or unwil l ing to indicate the gender of an ob j e c t .
I n those circums tances the third-person plural marker is employed as an
indefini te gender marker . For example , the plural marker i s used wi th
chiLd in example 159 not to indicate plural number , but to avoid spe ci fying
                                                                                  yen

"3.5.2.2.2           Causa t i ve , benefact i ve , refl ex i ve and rec i procal processes
Valency change and the gramma tical roles of the causee and affectee
     The causative process increases trans itivity generally by adding one
participant . In most cases the additional participant is marked as actor and
is the caus er of the state or event . The causee , manifesting the undergoer
function , usually functions l ike an actor (with agent , force , patient , or one
of the experiencer roles ) .
      Synthetic causativisation is restricted to intrans itive-l ike verbs
deriving two-place causative constructions from them with the causee in the
grammatical role of inner obj ect . Causative expressions formed with two- or
three-place verbs are normal ly analytical in nature . Experiencer verbs are
interesting examples to examine more closely s ince they are deviant in various
ways . Two types of expe riencer verbs will be discussed in this respect in the
next section .
      It is very unusual for a language to have morphological causative con­
structions which are restri cted to basi cally intransi tive predicates . The
explanation for thi s constraint i s to be found in the hi storical origin o f
causatives i n Alamblak , vi z . , the serial verb construction . Thi s point i s
taken up in section 3 . 5 . 2 . 2 . 5 where case frames of serial constructions are
dis cussed .
     Like the causative construction , a bene factive construction , also adds a
participant , thus increas ing transitivi ty . The additional participant functions
as an undergoer in the affective role , i . e . is an animate obj ect which i s
psychologically affected , or a n inanimate entity which is totally affected .
      A maj or diffe rence between causative and benefactive structures has to do
with valency changes . Whereas causatives are restricted to deriving 2-place
predicates from 1/2-place verbs ( or intrans i tive-like 2-place verbs in the
case of uncontrol led experiencer verbs) benefactives may derive 2-place or
3 -place verbs from 1/2-place and 2-place verbs . Benefactives can derive
4-place verbs from 3-place locatives but not from basic 3-place verbs .
Example 351 ( a) il lus trates a derived 3-place benefactive and example (b) is
an ungrammatical causative construction with the same verb .

The restric tions in both cases ( c ausative and benefactive forms ) are not
syntactical ly based ( e . g . constraints on syntactic doubling) .
     Syntactic doubl ing o f outer ob j ects is allowed in example 3 5 2 ( a ) . Doubling
of oute r obj ects al so occurs with simple 3-place verbs in non-derived form , with
certain res trictions , e . g .

The restrictions are semantic ; neither al lows doubl ing of agents or benefactees
in the s ame c l ause . The re is no syntactic doubling in the ungrammatical example
3 5 1 ( b ) but there are two agents , the man and his friend . Simi larly , example
3 5 2 ( b ) cannot be made grammatical by reducing the syntactic doubl ing of outer
objects as in example 3 54 , s ince two benefactees ( father and child) remain in
the clause .

These restrictions are consistent with restrictions on serial verb constructions
in general . Two verb roots must have the same actor unless a second actor i s
interpreted a s a n instrumental o r force role ( inanimate actor , thus a non-agent)

The topic NP i s in contrast with a term in the clause of Base l in the contrast
S . The notion o f topic as used here is merely a specially marked NP . The topic
NP in the contrastive negation clause retains all of the syntactic properties
of the NP in s imple clauses which would encode the role of the ' subj ect ' NP .
For example , a topic is , like a subj ect , coreferenced on the verb as actor .
Unlike topics in other languages , the NP or a copy of i t may not reappear in
the clause following the negative .
     The predicate of the contrastive negation clau s e is either a negation of
the predicate in the first base or a semantically contrasting one .

       Longacre ( 1976 : 110 , 111 ) argues that Papua New Guinean languages typically
employ a s ingle structure for the semantic relations of contrast and compari son
( degree conjoining such as in example 393 above ) . In fac t , he even suggests
that the logical notion of non-equivalent comparison (a differing of a feature
by degrees) may not be a part of the semantic structure of papua New Guinean
languages and that contrast is all that is expressed by sentence such as
example 393 above . Alamblak seems to be a clear example of a Papuan New Guinean
language with contrasting sentence structures for comparison and contrast ( cf .
Table 1 1 0 ) . I n other word s , the sentence in example 393 is not an ambiguous
sentence which could express contrast or simple coupling as well as a compari son .
I t encodes only compari son . No claim is being made in the example above that
one person is big or small in a general way , but they are big or small only in
relation to each other . Admittedly there is a s imilar basis for comparative
s tatements like this example which specify non-conventional standards of com­
pari son , and an absolute statement ( ' he is big ' ) or contrast ( ' she is big but
he is small ' ) which are appealing to some conventional standard against which
the absolute j udgment is made . Both types of expressions have components of
contrast and comparison with a s tandard . Dif ferent surface structures , however ,
serve to d ifferentiate the comparison based o n non-conventional standards
 ( comparative S ) from those based on conventional standards ( contrast S )        •
Const i t uent clauses of the compara ti ve sentence
      Both bases of the comparative sentence are mani fested by the same clause
type ; it thus provides the clearest example of the coordination of mutually
dependent clauses . Comparison clau ses are marked as dependent by their internal
intonational pattern . As with the contrastive negation clause , where the con­
trasting NP was termed the ' topic ' , the NP ' s whose referents are being compared
are termed ' topics ' for s imilar reasons . In both cases , for example , the topic
is separated from the rest of the clause intonationally .

"Independen t clauses
         The most common noun root which may be incorporated into the verb s tem o f
a predicate i n a n independent clause is the class of inalienably possessed nouns
( i . e . body parts , names , and body odour) in actor or patient roles . Other noun
roots which are incorporated are generic or inde finite obj ects in a patient role
in the clause .
       Derived transitive verbs may hos t two unincorporated NPs with the
inal ienable posses sion coreferenced as actor and the possessor as undergoer in
the specific role of patient . The inalienable possession is encoded as actor
s ince its function as the origin (or cause) of the state , action , or process ,
places it in more of an agentive role than the possessor plays ( c f . a fuller
discuss ion of inalienable possession in section 3 . 5 . 2 . 2 . 4 ) . Example 251

               A ohi ld ( 's) throat is dry on him .
Example 2 5 2 exhibits the incorporated body part . The syntactic result of
incorporation is that ( 1 ) the incorporated noun occurs to the left of the
first verb root , ( 2 ) it can no longer be coreferenced on the verb , and ( 3 ) i t
loses i t s own phrase terminator , ( 4 ) it then may be bounded by verbal inflection
as any other verb s'tem ( c ) .

     Noun incorporation i n independent clauses is fairly rare apart from the
incorporation of inalienably possessed nouns . Noun incorporation is much more
frequent in dependent clauses as discussed in the next few pages . An instance
of an incorporated generic patient noun root in a bas ic two-place c lause is
given in example 2 5 5 .

     Orientation roles provide the spatial and temporal orientation of the
proposition . They are summarised as follows with approximating English glosses :

     These roles and the case -marking systems which encode them have been
discussed in section 3 . 4 . 2 . We have therefore only summarised them here and
now proceed to discuss interpretation rules associated with the case markers
that encode them.","[216, 217]"
