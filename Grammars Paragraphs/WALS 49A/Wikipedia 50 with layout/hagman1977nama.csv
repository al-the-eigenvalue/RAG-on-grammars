 ‘aop = leader).”      d. A Note on haa and ’ii. \t might be remarked at this point that the word
haa, used to form the perfective and non-punctual aspects and used in the
negation of the stative verb phrase, and the past tense copula ‘if have syntactic
properties in common with the auxiliary verbs. Indeed, it is possible to look
upon each of them as a special type of auxiliary verb.
      Picking an earlier example of the perfect aspect at random, the sentence
kxoen ke ké #1 hda ’it. “The people had thought.” might be considered to
 contain the complex stative verb #’d7 hda “have thought” as the predicate of a
 stative verb phrase presence by the remote past tense marker ké and followed by
 the past tense copula 77. Even the same sentence in the present tense, Axden ke
# di haa, “The people have thought.,” can be analyzed as a stative verb phrase,
since the present tense-copula ‘a is deleted with haa (p. 84). The same analysis
 could be made of any sentence containing aa as part of the non-punctual aspect
or the negation of a stative verb phrase. However, there are two ways in which
hada differs from the auxiliary verbs. First, the perfective and non-punctual
aspects, in which Ada is used, are both part of a larger aspect system, i.e., they
contrast semantically with the imperfective and punctual aspects (neither of
which is conveyed by an auxiliary verb). Second, the tense marker may be
moved between the first verb and haa, e.g., kxden ke #’di ké hada ‘ii. “The
people had thought.,” something which can never be done to a complex verb,
e.g., tiita ke ké !itu //xda’ it. “I could go.,” but not *tiita ke hiu ké //xda ‘it.
Thus, we must retain for haa special status in the grammar.
        In a similar manner, we might look at the past tense copula, ‘7, in a
sentence with a stative verb phrase as an auxiliary verb. A sentence such as //’fip
ke ké /'uu ‘it. “He did not know.” could be analyzed as containing the complex
verb /‘uu ‘ii “not know” as the V[+tact] of an active verb phrase: //’fip ke ké
[/'u if]. However, the participation of ‘7 in a larger system where it alternates
with the present tense-copula ‘2, and the tense movemens which may separate if
from the verb which precedes it, e.g., /[tip ke /ti ké “it., guarantee’it’ special
status in the grammar.
       Although haa and ‘if have syntactic properties which set them apart from
all other morphemes in the language, we cannot ignore the existence of two
verbs which   are identical to them in form and similar in meaning, viz., the verbs
hda “to exist, to be (in a place)” and 7if “‘to happen, to go.” The     former is a

in any order: (a) an adverb, (b) a post-positional phrase, (c) a temporal NPa.
These constructions which realize the Advl express concepts such as “place,”
“time,” “‘manner,” “attitude,” “accompaniment,” “instrument,” “‘agent,”’ and
“comparison.” To illustrate the three different adverbial constructions, let us
take a simple active/stative sentence and add to it: ""dop ke ké !x6éé. “The man
ran.”; ‘dop ke !haése ké Ixdé. “The man ran rapidly.”; *dop ke ‘oms !’od ké !x6é.
“The man ran to the house.”; ’dop ke /hapé //’dépa ké !xdé, “‘The man ran for a
long time.” As an illustration of how complicated the Advl constituent may be,
take the following sentence: pili ke méris xaa //’ari haip /xda ‘oms !nda ké
#nathé. “Bill was hit by Mary yesterday (//‘ari) with the stick (hatp /xda) in
the house (‘oms /naa).” The        adverbial constructions in this sentence, méris xaa,
/Vari, haip /xda, and ‘oms !nda, may be rearranged in any order without
changing the meaning of the sentence. We shall now now look at each of the
construction types in tum.","[39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]"

       The earliest attempt at the linguistic description of a Khoisan language was
made by the philosopher Leibnitz in 1717. Leibnitz devotes nine pages in his
Colectanea Etymologica (pp. 375-84) to the discussion of a dialect of Cape
Hottentot, a language which is now long extinct but which appears to be closely
related to Nama and Korana Hottentot (Meinhof 1909:33).

A conjunctive sentence is a sentence which begins with a conjunction. Except                                                                          one   sentence     taken     out   of   such   a

for this fact, a conjunctive sentence is no different from an ordinary declarative                                                           self-con tained    to   a  native     speaker.      This

Semantically, the conjunction in this type of sentence relates the sentence to the                                                      status  as a  unit   of descripti  on  on    the   grounds

       With the conjunctions tsi? “and” and xape “but,” subject deposition,
according to the same rules which apply in the initialization permutation (p.

                                    VI.    PERMUTATION
So far, all example sentences have been presented in what we might call
“normal” sentence order, i.e., in the order which occurs with the greatest
frequency   and which       can, therefore, be assumed         to be basic. Furthermore, it is
only when the sentence is in this normal order that a constituent analysis as neat
as the preceding one can be performed. An important feature of Nama syntax,
however, is that it allows for considerable variety in the ordering of sentence
constituents to emphasize or de-emphasize a particular element in the sentence.
The variability in ordering is best viewed as the result of departures from the
normal order and, as such, can be reduced to three simple principles of
permutation. They are: (a) initialization, whereby an element is brought to the
beginning of the sentence, (b) finalization, whereby an element is brought to the
end of the sentence, and (c) internal scrambling, whereby certain elements
within the sentence are re-ordered. Each of these principles of permutation
incorporates a set of syntactic restrictions which govern which element may be
moved, and where it may be moved without destroying the acceptability of the
sentence to a native speaker and without changing its essential meaning.
      Permutation is optional for all declarative sentences. It is obligatory for
many interrogative sentences, specifically, those which contain interrogative
words, in which case the interrogative word must be initialized. Though such
interrogative   sentences    have    not   yet   been   discussed,   and will not be discussed
until the question of the interrogative sentence can be treated as a whole (p.
141), it is useful to point out here that the permutation of an interrogative
sentence is governed by the same restrictions as that of a declarative sentence.
For now, let us restrict our discussion to the optional permutation of a
declarative sentence.
       There is a way in which the structure of the interrogative sentence does
play a role in the optional permutation of the declarative. In conversation, when                                                 107

Any italicized constituent may be initialized, and tense and copula may be
initialized if the predicate is.                                                                                                       B. FINALIZATION
        Unless the predicate (V[+sta] or NP-Comp) is initialized, only one of the
underlined sentence constituents may be initialized in any one sentence, and                Finalization is the bringing of an element to the end of the sentence. Unlike
deposition of the subject NP is obligatory. The sentence /ous ke ‘a ’iixd. “The             initialization, the process of finalization is very simple, being governed by one
daughter (/oas) is beautiful (’a’fixd).” may have its predicate ’tixd, an NP-Comp           rule: Any adverbial or subordinated noun phrase (NPa) may be finalized. More
consisting of an adjective, initialized resulting in ""fixds ke /Oasa ‘a. “The               than one such unit may be finalized, but this happens rarely. Here are the
daughter is beautiful.” When the predicate is initialized, the tense and copula are         formulas for the active and stative sentences with the constituents which may be
usually moved to the position after the declarative particle ke and before the              finalized in italics:

      A frequent type of stative sentence with an adverbial is the “comparative”
construction (p. 87). Observe the following sentence in the normal order: hadap             Here is an active sentence in the normal order: sitke ke //ndapd pdas /xda ké sit.

The adverbial “drip xaa “than the dog” may be initialized, resulting in: “artfp             This   sentence      may     have    the    following   forms     with   finalization   of different

     Another frequent adverbial in a stative sentence is the adverb kdise “very.”           the same as the sentence in normal order.

 Of all the languages in Greenberg’s Khoisan phylum, the language called Nama
 Hottentot, or simply Nama, is both the most famous and the most widely
 spoken. Nama is spoken by about 30,000 people spread over all but the most
 northern part of the territory of South West Africa. The total number of
 speakers is evenly divided between two racially and culturally different groups:
(1) the Namas, the people to whom the term ‘‘Hottentot” is usually applied,
who occupy the area to the south of Windhoek, and (2) the negroid Damaras, or
Bergdamas, who occupy the area to the north of Windhoek. Most speakers of
Nama also speak Afrikaans as a second language, and a small number can speak
English, German or Herero (a Bantu language) as well.
       Nama belongs to Greenberg’s Central Khoisan group of languages. Within
this group, the language most closely related to it is Korana Hottentot, also
called Korana or Kora, spoken by a very small number of people in a small area
just west of Kimberley in South Africa. Nama and Korana are so similar that
there is some degree of mutual intelligibility. Also in the Central Khoisan group
are some languages spoken in northern Botswana, the most notable of which are
Naron and Hietschware, but these are not nearly so related to Nama as Korana
is.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"

      There are two varieties of embedding which have special relevance to the

                                                                                        though, strictly speaking, it is not really a sentence. There are three forms of the

                                                                                        the particle he, (b) a noun phrase in the second person, and (c) a noun stem

close to that of the conjunction tsfi ‘‘and.” A short sentence like ""ui Ti xu!”
                                                                                        tit Oats! (c) tit oa! “My son!” (a) mariase!, (b) marias!, (c) maria! “Maria!” A

linked together in this manner.       b. The Causal Construction with xuike. The causal embedding construc-
tion with xuike. mentioned briefly in the chapter on embedding (p. 130), is
notable in that it may only occur within an imperative-horative sentence where it
embeds a declarative sentence. The following examples are typical: tad //xadpa
miipate //naitta kd xuike! ‘Don’t (tdd) tell me (mripate) again (/ /xadpd) pecans:
I just heard (//naiata ko xuike)!” The embedded sentence is: //naista (ke) kd. “
(-ta) just heard (/[naiu... k0).” haa titta tapa sores ko #aa xuike! “Stay (hid)
with me (tifta tapa, lit., “at me”) because the sun went in (sores ko #aa xuike)!”
The embedded sentence is: sdres (ke) kd #aa. “The sun (sdres) just went in (ké
#daa).”
                B. IMPERATIVE-HORTATIVE EQUIVALENTS
The imperative-hortative sentence is not the only means by which speakers of
Nama issue a command or an exhortation. Declarative sentences with either the
future or indefinite tense may be used for the same purpose. The hearer must
judge from the non-linguistic context whether the sentence is to be interpreted
