CLASS prefix (ka-lko-jak-lki-la-) may occur on any verb when the subject
or object of that verb is a member of the fa* -noun class. There is no overt
marker on the noun to distinguish it from other nouns. In this case ""subject
or object"" is not restricted to postverbal position or nonoccurrence of a
case-marking clitic, as it is in the case of gender agreement (sect. 18.4).(611)     o-ka-nofi-ki              oni vanami
          ISG-N.CLASS-want-NONTHEME DEM paddle
          Ί want that paddle.'",[147]
"  Finally in the constituent order parameter, the S and O nominals can be
postposed to the verb and right-dislocated. In this case, they retain their
case-marking enclitics. The pragmatic function here is that of clarification of
the referent, which is only marked for person, gender or number in the
verb of the main predication. Additional prominence is thus given for
purposes of disambiguation or emphasis.(140)   bi-oga-ki,               ovari      Parajairo-a

        'He knew, that one Parajairo (knew).'",[37]
"A single name may represent a group, in which case the plural agreement
occurs.",[97]
"  If the object is plural and animate then the plural object pronoun
obligatorily precedes the verb. A noun phrase object may also occur and
usually precedes the pronoun. In that case, both the noun phrase and
pronoun are usually tagged with -ra. This can result in either OVS order
(9) or SOV order.(9)     sorara-ra    va'o-ra       va-ni-'a-vini

        'The two fellows said to the soldiers.'",[5]
"   In these embedded constructions, the equative clause is always the first
constituent of the main clause. This fits the pattern of fronting constituents
and adding certain elements (in this case mani + DEM) for the purpose
of emphasis, contrast, or prominence of some kind. In the case of the
embedded equative construction, as we suggest in 14.1.3, the effect seems
to be much the same as the pseudo-clefting device in English, See also
section 9.2.3.
  The equative clause, as a constituent of the main clause, usually stands
alone, without any enclitic or particle following it. Occasionally, as in (339),
a particle (yiahania) may follow, and it seems to function as part of the
(adverbial) constituent(339)   o-a-na-ja'di-vini              mani                    ida

"The noun phrase part of the plural object may also occur following the
verb, leaving the pronoun in the immediately preverbal position. In this
case, only the pronoun has the -ra enclitic, but the noun phrase occurs with
the plural demonstrative.

The syntactically distinct clause types are: intransitive, transitive, ditransitive
and copular-equative,1.1 Intransitive. The basic word order of the intransitive clause is VS. The
subject noun phrase obligatorily contains a demonstrative in the initial
position. There is no other form of case-marking.
   There is no overt marking to distinguish an intransitive active verb from
an intransitive stative verb. The verb (frequently) and the demonstrative
(always) agree in number, gender and class with the noun of the subject
constituent (sects. 15.2 and 18.4).(1)     soko-a-ki                hida  mamai

"   The ka- nouns form a small subclass that do not seem to have any
semantic link with each other. Out of certain classificatory lists (e.g. birds,
fruit, objects) a few items will be ka- nouns. (Out of 45 animals 2 are ka-,
out of 80 birds 8 are ka-, out of 46 reptiles and insects 10 are ka-, and out
of 84 fish none are ka-,)
   To give specific examples, all the following are ka- nouns: katopahian
'rainbow', ho'doko 'dove', 'ba'dana 'type of lizard', bava'do 'type of frog',
kasi'i 'alligator*, kaboka 'type of ant', moka'a'a 'spider', barasia
'watermelon', jaro'oa 'corn', kabahai 'thigh', kajoi 'intestines', jokira 'salt',
kojira 'spoon*, kanava 'canoe', vanami 'paddle'.
   There are a few homophonous words that are distinguished by their noun
class:                    (ka-)           (non-ka-)
         r
        sa ai       'hand'         'finger'

        siho        'fire*          'firewood'  A noun modifier within the phrase and a prefix on the verb show
agreement with a ka- class noun. (The class marker normally has the form
ka- (377a), but is sometimes a- (383), ko- or ki-.)
  The agreement is governed by the head noun in the case of noun
modifiers (377a) and by the intransitive subject (377b) or the direct object
(377a) in the case of the ka- verb prefix.(377a) o-ka-nofi-ki                      oni     vanami ka-karaho

256 Abbott  The ka- 'N.CLASS* prefix also occurs on the Subject Emphasis pronoun
(see (441) in sect. 16.1) and on postpositions (see (466) in sect 17). It is
prefixed to the auxiliary verbs hi (sect. 18.8.2 and for an example see
(107)) and m (see (767) and (768) in sect. 18.9). As (767) shows, a loan
word (mesa 'table') can belong to the ka- class.

"9.2.2 Uses of the particle vani. The particle vani is postposed to a noun
phrase or pronoun to indicate that the referent is being selected out of
other possible choices, or is in contrast with other referents in the
immediate context. The phrase with vani may be the subject or object of
the clause, and it is always pre verbal and usually in the clause -initial
position. There are three basic types of construction, each expressing a
different degree of prominence with respect to the referent
   First, να/ΐϊ may occur alone following the noun phrase or pronoun. In this
case, the contrast or selection is being stated or implied, but without any
special prominence.(142)   mina'di      vani-a                    bi-noba-'iana-hi

clauses: OVS and SOV. In both, the object occurs immediately before the
verb and is marked by the enclitic -ra OBJ'. This signals that the
accusative system is now operating, and it is mutually exclusive with the
ergative system, so that the subject now does not receive any form of
case-marking and can occur before the object or after the verb, but cannot
occur in the immediately preverbal position (sect. 15.1). The pragmatic
conditions under which these orders occur are discussed in section 9.2. In
these -ra constructions, it is the subject that controls the number and
gender agreement in the verb-final suffix and the demonstrative (see (7); in
(8) the verb-final suffix is -ki 'NONTHEME', which is neutral as regards
gender). A demonstrative never co-occurs with -ra in the object noun
phrase in this preverbal position. See Chapman (1981) and Derbyshire
(1983 and 1986).(7)     maravi-ra   namonaha-hi         ida   mamai

"14.1 Adverbial clauses. The main characteristic of adverbial clauses is the
verb-final suffix, which is either -vim 'DEP:TRANS' or -nij-na
'DEP:INTRANS, f/m'. This replaces the verb-final thematic suffixes that
occur in main clauses (sect. 18.6.1). Otherwise, the dependent verb has all
the potential for affixation of a main verb. This dependent verb form is not
restricted to adverbial subordinate clauses. It can also function as a subject,
object, or equative predicate complement (14.2). It also occurs at times as
the nucleus of an independent clause, with or without a form of the
auxiliary verb hi following it, but without any main verb to which it is
subordinated.
   It is this latter characteristic that is common to the three main types of
adverbial clause construction we discuss below: dependent verb form alone
(14.1.1); dependent verb form and subordinating particle (14.1.2); and
dependent verb form and hi auxiliary construction (14.1.3). In the case of
the subordinating particles, they sometimes occur with thematic suffixes
instead of dependent suffixes on the verb. These adverbial clauses have the
same word order patterns as main clauses. They most often consist only of
the verb, but it is common to find a single nominal constituent plus verb,
and the sequences VS, VO and OV all occur frequently. It is rare to find
more than one nominal.
  There is one other type of adverbial clause which occurs occasionally.
This is the participial, in which neither the thematic suffixes nor the
dependent suffixes occur (14.1.4).",[65]
"If there are more than two elements other than the particle, kalmoni
precedes a demonstrative.(275)   . . . joraki-a    a'diahi-ja  kaimoni                 hida

        "" . . . for the purpose of finishing their work quickly/  The form kaimoni can also function as a benefactive following a nominal
In this case it is inflected and inalienably possessed, the paradigm being:        kodi-imoni                'for me'
        kada-imoni                'for you, SG'

        ka-imoni                Tor named person'
           e.g., Maria kaimoni             'for Maria';
           or following a grammatical construction,
           e.g., osokoaki kaimoni          'for me to wash'.",[69]
"While (286) is semantically a manner clause, it would be more accurate to
describe it syntactically as a demoted object (i.e., complement) clause than
an adverbial clause. The main verb meaning 'teach* is ditransitive and in
these constructions the recipient or beneficiary is always the direct object,
marked by the enclitic -ra OBJ', with the patient being the demoted object
marked either by -a OBL' or (as in 286) by a demonstrative. (See section
1.3 for discussion of ditransitive clauses.)
   There is one other more complex type of adverbial clause with which the
hi construction functions as the main clause. This is an equative clause in
which the predicate nominal is expressed by means of a dependent verb
form. In this construction the whole equative clause is functioning as an
adverbial. (For other functions of equative clauses in complex sentences»
see 14.2 and 14.6). The equative clause always precedes the hi construction.
It consists of a predicate nominal, the copula mani and a demonstrative.
The predicate nominal may consist only of the dependent verb (288) or it
may also have a subject (289, 290) or object (291) nominal grammatically
related to that verb. The nominal always precedes the verb and, when the
verb is transitive, is marked by the appropriate enclitic, -a 'ERG1 (290) or
-ra OBJ' (291), The semantic functions expressed are either reason
(288-291) or purpose (292, 293).(288)   o-vai'ami-na           mani           ida      ho-ra

234 Chapman and DerbyshireIn (292) the purpose particle kaimoni governs the dependent verb form,
whereas in (293) it governs a noun phrase and is itself governed by the
dependent verb, which in this case is the dependent form of the auxiliary
hi, glossed here as 'be'. There is no significant difference in meaning
between the two uses of kaimoni.
   There is, however, a significant pragmatic function served by the use of
the equative clause in all these examples (288-293). As noted in 14.6 and
section 9.2.3, whenever an equative clause is used in the sentence-initial
position, as a single constituent of that sentence, it adds a degree of
prominence to that constituent, whether it refers primarily to a participant
or, as in these examples, to a proposition. It has much the same effect as a
pseudo-cleft construction in English, so that (288), for example, could be
glossed something like: 'It is because I was hungry that she gave me food'.
   The hi construction is also used as the second in a two-clause sequence
to express result. In this case, both clauses are main clauses, marked as
such by the verb-final thematic suffix.(294)   ka-mokhi-ki           ida   gamo  morobo-ni,

"9.2.3 Placement of demonstrative in preverbal position. In the pragmatically
least marked clauses, the demonstrative is associated with the noun phrase
that follows the verb, whether this is the subject or the object, and it never
also occurs preverbally in the same clause (sects. 1.1, 1.2 and 15.3.2). There
are two ways in which it may be associated with noun phrases in the
preverbal position, and in each case it serves to give special prominence to
the referent of the noun phrase.
   In the first construction, the demonstrative follows the noun phrase. It
then has the same form as an equative clause. (The copula mani may also
occur in these embedded equative constructions, just as in the simple
equative clause—see section 1.4, and compare section 14.6 for more
complex embeddings involving equative and subordinate clauses.) The
function of this placement of the demonstrative is to draw special attention
to the identity of the referent in the noun phrase, which may be the
subject (148) or object (149) of the clause.(148)   makha bana              hada       haria ananaha-ra

                             Introduction
The Paumari tribe is located in the State of Amazonas in Brazil. There are
three main groups. Approximately 270 live on the Purus River, 50 on the
Ituxi River and 200 on the Tapaua River. The latter group does not have
contact with the other two groups. The Purus and Ituxi River groups have
occasional contact with each other. They are all semi-nomadic fishermen
travelling extensively within their own area. There are minor dialectal
differences, mostly regarding vocabulary» among the three groups. The
material used for this analysis was obtained during prolonged contact
(1964-84) with the Paumari living on the Purus River. Some members of
this group had originated on the Ituxi River and the Sepatini River.
Paumari is classified as an Arauan language, possibly remotely related to
the Arawakan family.
   It appears that the Paumari began to have regular contact with
non-Indian travellers about 1900. During the past 50 years the number of
Portuguese speaking settlers in the area has steadily increased. This
increasing contact has led the Paumari into a negative attitude towards
their own language and culture and the adoption of many non-Indian
beliefs and customs. For example, their houses are now all built on land,
whereas traditionally they lived on raft houses; they have adopted local
patterns of dress and use many imported items (cloth, cooking and fishing
equipment, tools, kerosene, sugar, salt, etc.).
   The language change is perhaps the most significant and disturbing. All
of the Paumari speak a complete mixture of Paumari and Portuguese. A
sentence is frequently a total mixture of both languages, the grammar of
neither being preserved. Some of the Paumari language spoken by the
older people is no longer used or even known by the younger generation,
yet no one has an adequate mastery of Portuguese grammar or vocabulary.
This process is more advanced among the Paumari on the Tapaua"" River,                                                       Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

162 Chapman and Derbyshirewhere the present generation of teenagers and younger children no longer
speak Paumari.
   This analysis reflects the language, as far as possible, in its pre-modified
form. Numerous texts (over 200) have been collected on tape, transcribed
and analyzed. These were given by a cross-section of the people, old and
young, men and women. Texts were mostly first person experiences,
legends and letters. The person who gave the text was usually the one who
helped to transcribe it and who frequently edited out the Portuguese and
corrected the grammar that had been changed as a result of the mixture.
Most texts have been further edited or corrected by someone other than
the original speaker. In the initial stages there were no literate Paumari,
but now the readers are able to check older texts and write short stories.
Because the writers are consciously trying to write in one language there is
less of a mixture than in the daily spoken language.
   The process of acculturation and devaluation of the Paumari culture and
language was very far advanced before the initial contact by Chapman and
Mary Ann Odmark in 1964. Continuing contact was made possible through
a contract between the Summer Institute of Linguistics and the Indian
Department (Fundacäo Nacional do Indio) of the Brazilian government.
   We would like to acknowledge the contribution that has been made at
different times on various aspects of the language by Mary Ann Odmark,
Chapman's partner for many years in the Indian area, and by the following
consultants: Joan Boswood, Eunice Burgess, Thomas Crowell, Irvine Davis,
Robert Dooley, Joe Grimes, Ivan Lowe, and Mary Ruth Wise. For some of
the morphosyntactic characteristics presented here, see Derbyshire (1986),
which usually gives a more concise statement, but occasionally develops a
topic more fully than this description does (e.g., case marking of nominals).
   The language material for this paper was gathered by Chapman, who
also did most of the analysis and preliminary writing. Derbyshire
contributed to the analysis and writing of the final manuscript.","[1, 2]"
"14.3 Relative clauses. A relative clause has an inflected verb with the suffix
-fa. This suffix is glossed 'NONTHEME* when it occurs in a main verb and
'DESC when it occurs as a nominal modifier. In this function, it can often
be regarded as a simple adjective (sect. 15.3), as well as a relative clause.
The head noun which the clause modifies may be the subject (310, 311),
direct object (312, 313), or oblique constituent (314, 315) of the main
clause. There do not appear to be any restrictions on the syntactic
functions which the relativized constituent can have in the relative clause,
the following examples illustrating subject (310, 311, 312), object (313, 314)
and genitive (315) relativization. The relative clause normally follows the
noun it modifies (but can have another constituent of the noun phrase
following it, as in (314) and (315)), and the case markers -ra OBJ' and -a
'ERG' (311, 312) follow the relative clause when this is the final constituent
of the whole noun phrase and when that phrase functions as object or
subject, respectively, of the main clause in the preverbal position.(310)   siri   ka-jokira-ri-ki     ho-ra

"15.4 Nominalizations. Most verbs can be nominalized by the addition of a
verb-final derivational suffix. Verb-final theme and dependent suffixes (sect,
18.6.1) do not co-occur with these nominalizing suffixes,
   Most intransitive verb roots and a few transitive roots take the
nominalizer ~i. The resulting form can be possessed, this being marked by
the addition of one of the set of the alienable possession prefixes (15.2).
The focus of this nominalization is on the action or state, or the result of
the action or state. Examples:                                                        Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

construction, are normally uninflected. In these cases they are immediately
followed by an inflected form of the auxiliary verb ni (sect 18.8.1). Their
roots can also have -ni suffixed to them to form a nominalization, which
can take the alienable set of possession prefixes. An example is the root

"14.6 Embedded equative clauses. In earlier subsections of section 14, we
have shown that equative clauses with dependent verb predicate norninals
can be embedded as a limited number of constituent types in a main
clause: subject, passive agent and adverbial clause. In this subsection we
discuss some general characteristics of these embedded equatives.
   Equative clauses are described in section 1.4. Only those clauses that
have the copula mam are involved in these embeddings. In every case,
mani is followed by a demonstrative. In the simple equative clause, the
predicate complement is a noun phrase and the demonstrative agrees with
the head noun of that phrase.",[83]

5 Passives
The passive construction is clearly intransitive and differs from the
corresponding active (transitive) construction in the following ways:       a) Neither the ergative nor object marking enclitics occur.
       b) The 3SG prefix bi-, associated with the ergative case-marking
       system, does not occur.
       c) The object of the active clause becomes the subject of the
       passive, and an optional agentive phrase marked by the enclitic
       -a may occur. That this is not the ergative marker is clear from
       the postverbal position that this constituent has in the passive
       construction.
       d) There is an auxiliary verb hi, which co-occurs with one of two
       types of subordinate verb form, either a nominalized form,
       marked by the suffix -hi 'NOMLZR' (74), or a dependent clause
       marked by the suffix -nil-na (DEP:INTRANS( (78) (sect. 14.1). It
       is always the dependent intransitive suffix, never the dependent
       transitive, that occurs in this construction.","[19, 20]"
"   The Ο nominal is given special prominence by being fronted and
left-dislocated. In this case it does not have the case-marking enclitic -ra.

"The final example is clearly a case of ellipsis of the verb. The demoted
object may be any suitable noun, but never an embedded clause. Example
(235) is probably an ellipsis also and the appropriate verb is sometimes
added.
  The suffix -ha 'distance' indicates that the command is to be fulfilled in a
different location.(237)   a-'bai-'a-va

"   It also occurs on all motion verbs when travel is in one vehicle, whether
by land, river or air. When the vehicles are plural, the 'walking-by-land'
form of the verb is used. The word for 'canoe', kanava, is a ka- CLASS
word and ka- occurs in the verb, but in this case it is glossed 'canoe', since
this is often the only reference in the clause to 'canoe'.(612)     a-o-kha-ki                     hari

"9.2 Noun phrase marking to express prominence in relation to participant
reference. There are five principal devices used to highlight noun phrase
referents: variation in the order of clause constituents (9.2.1); postposing of
the particle vani 'CONTRAST, SELECTION' to the noun phrase (9.2.2);
placement of demonstrative in preverbal position (9.2.3); use of special
subject-emphasis pronouns (9.2.4); and the use of certain forms of hi 'AUX'
immediately following the noun phrase to express a contrastive focus
function (9.2.5).",[36]
"  A fronted equative clause can also be the object complement of the main
verb, though this seems to occur less frequently than the subject
complement construction. In this case, the predicate nominal is a
nominalized, not a dependent, verb and the equative clause is not followed
by the direct object marker enclitic -ra, since it includes the demonstrative:(304)   vakadi-fajafaja-hi      mani            oni

16 Pronoun system
AH the personal pronouns in the first and second person consist of a root
or enclitic and a person prefix: ho- '1SG', i- '2SG', han- '1PL' and a'oni-
'2PL'. The root to which these are affixed determines the kind of pronoun.
Either the demonstrative or the emphatic pronoun is used in the third
person. The demonstratives are: ida/oni/hida *3SG,f; ada/o/hada '3SGfm';
and adani/hadani '3PL' (see sect 15.3.2). The emphatic pronouns are
onianiloniaro '3SG,f; ovari '3SG,m'; and va'oniaro 3ΡΙΛ16.1 Subject pronouns. An unmarked clause does not have a free subject
pronoun because the person is marked by a verbal prefix. The subject
pronouns are therefore part of the pragmatic information system which is
discussed in section 9.2. Subject pronouns are either ""contrast/selection"" or
""emphatic"" forms.
  The contrast/selection pronouns have the root vani 'CONTR' and almost
always occur clause initial.(433)   pnma Bitxi vara va'o-ra

        'Cousin Bitxi talked from the canoe about them, but I went up the
        bank.'","[105, 106, 107]"
"15.1 Marking for case. The subject of a transitive verb is marked with the
enclitic -a *ERG' when this constituent occurs immediately before the verb
and is not associated with a demonstrative.(351)   mamai-a       bi-n-oba-hi                   ida   ava pa'itxi
        mother-ERG 3SG-CAUS-chop-THEME              DEM,f tree small
        'Mother chopped down a small tree.'",[90]
"  The sequence ka-. . . -khama is also used for reciprocal constructions,
when it co-occurs with the inflected free form reflexive abono 'self (sect.
4.2). In this case the subject and the object (reflexive form) agree in
person and number. The affixes a- and -na do not occur in the reciprocal
construction.(668)   va-abono va-ka-ra-kha-khama-vini

"In modern speech, every Paumari uses the Portuguese se 'if clause initially,
which makes it unambiguously conditional.
  The contrafactual conditional relationship is also expressed by two
clauses. The first is obligatorily marked by the particle vaha

164 Chapman and Derbyshire  There are further variations of constituent order, including peripheral
constituents, which are discussed in section 9,2.
  The main differences between intransitive and transitive clauses are:      —the object is obligatorily absent in an intransitive clause,
      whereas it is always structurally present in a transitive clause
      even though it is sometimes not overtly expressed.
      —case-marking clitics occur in transitive clauses, but never in an
      intransitive clause.
      —the 3SG. person prefix hi- occurs in transitive clauses as part
      of the ergative-marking system, but it never occurs in intransitive
      clauses.
      —in the imperative mode the 2SG person suffix is omitted in
      intransitive clauses but occurs in transitive clauses.","[3, 4]"
"   When the predicate nominal is a dependent verb construction, this type
of equative clause never occurs as an independent main clause or sentence.
Its grammatical function appears to be restricted to the three categories:
subject, passive agent and adverbial; and the semantic functions seem to be
limited to agent, cause-reason and purpose. Equative clauses with noun
phrase complements can occur as independent main clauses (334a, b), and
also as direct objects (340), as well as subjects (341).(340)   nahina mani hida       i-nofi-ja

"
3 Ellipsis
In a discourse or dialogue the subject and object nominals are frequently
omitted if the referent can be understood from the context. The context
may be the immediate discourse or the social setting. Kinship terms may be
used as referents, implying that the listener is familiar with the kinship
system and the speaker's role in it. One person may be named to
represent a whole group of participants.
  When a native speaker, who is not the author, is checking a text, the
checker is often unable to supply specific information. This shows that
omitted material is not always recoverable, even by someone from the
culture.",[15]
"9 Pragmatic and discourse characteristics
Certain types of discourse-conditioned phenomena are referred to in other
sections. See especially sections 13 (anaphora), 16 (pronouns), and 21.2
(particles). Here, we will describe some of the devices used to express
varying degrees of pragmatically-motivated prominence marking. This is
mainly in relation to noun phrases, demonstratives and pronouns, where a
particular referent is highlighted (Chapman 1981). We begin first, however,
with choices relating to certain verb suffixes, which signal prominence and
information status of the complete clause in the discourse context.",[34]

250 Chapman and Derbyshire                       Syntax of Phrase Types15 Noun phrase structure
A noun phrase is a noun functioning as head with optional modifiers and
particle, or a pronoun. The demonstrative is not considered a constituent of
the noun phrase but is discussed in section 15.3.2.","[89, 90]"
"1.2 Transitive. The basic word order is SVO. When this basic pattern is
used, the ergative system always operates, so that the subject is marked by
the enclitic -a 'ERG' and the object noun phrase has a demonstrative in
the initial position (sect. 15.1).
  In this constituent order the subject noun governs the person prefix on
the verb for person and number, and the object noun governs the number
and gender of the verb-final suffix and the demonstrative.",[4]
"9.2.1 Variation in the order of clause constituents. The basic orders of
clause constituents are (intransitive) VS and (transitive) SVO (sects. 1.1 and
1.2). Variations from these orders result in one or both of the S and Ο
nominale being marked as either more prominent or less prominent than in
the unmarked (basic) orders. Another common order in transitive clauses is
OVS (133), in which the Ο is given more prominence as a marked topic
by being fronted, and the S is demoted to postverbal position; the Ο is also
morphologically marked by the -ra case-marking enclitic (sects. 1.2 and
15.1). Both the S and O nominals can be further demoted by being omitted
from the clause (134).(133)   i'oa-ra         na-hado-ha         ada kodi-abi'i
        tambaqui-OEI CAUS-knife-THEME DEM,m my-father
        'My father cut the tambaqui fish.'(134)   va-nako'di-ha
        3PL-seek:for-THEME
        'They searched for it.'",[36]
"   In the second type of construction, the demonstrative precedes or
replaces the noun phrase. In this case, the demonstrative is always the first
constituent of the clause and functions to give emphasis to a topic that has
already been established in the discourse. It may refer to the subject (150)
or object (151) of the clause.(150)   ada   bana    jara       kavi   kagahafani hoarani
        DEM,m WARNING non:Indian liquor bottle     one        maina-ra vi-gai-rnori-'a-ha

        DEM leaves big:and:black-OBJ NEG-3PL-find-ASP-THEME
        'The big black leaves they didn't find.'",[40]
"  The direction 'away from' prefix a-/o-/ri-/ra- may occur on all motion
verbs (612, 613) and a few non-motion verbs. In the latter case, the
meaning is that of distance not direction (614).(614)   bi-a-noki-'i-hi              ida  gora
        3SG-away-see-ASP-THEME DEM house
        'He saw in the distance a house.'",[148]
"The phrase ada kasi'i katavahari 'the toucans' is the object of the main
verb. That phrase is not repeated in the passive construction but the
demonstrative ada which occurs preceding va-nafa-na 'their eggs' is the
same referent, this time as agent. A case-marking enclitic and a
demonstrative never co-occur on the same constituent, so the agent is
morphologically unmarked. Both kinds of birds are masculine. The -na
occurring on the second auxiliary verb, hi-na, is masculine in agreement
with the agent 'the toucans'. The -na occurring in va-nafa-na 'their eggs' is
masculine in agreement with the possessor, siro. The word -nafa 'egg' is
feminine and thus -ni on the verb ha-ni 'eat' is also feminine to agree with
the eggs. (See fuller discussion of gender in section 15.2).
   Sometimes the agent of a passive construction remains unspecified, either
because it is unknown to the speaker, or because he does not wish to
reveal the information, or simply because the context makes it clear, as in
(79).",[22]
"  The third vani construction is used to express strong contrast. In this
case, the NP/PRO-van/ phrase is followed by a demonstrative.(146)   o-vani           ada             kapita abono ka'oa-ra

personal possessions'. In a question it may function as an interrogative
adjective (181) or an interrogative pronoun. It is never inflected. It may
occur as the only constituent of a nominal question phrase (179), but it
frequently occurs in an equative identificational clause with or without mani
'COP' (cf. 180).
   The following examples show nahina as: a noun phrase subject (176); a
predicate complement in an equative clause where the whole equative
clause functions as subject (177), direct object (178), or demoted object
(180); modifying a head noun in a temporal phrase (181); an oblique
constituent with a source (182) or instrument (183) function; or as a direct
object with the enclitic -ra (184, 185).","[44, 45]"
"  This is the only reflexive construction in the language, there being no
verbal derivational affixes that perform this function nor any reflexive
pronominal possessor form.",[19]

verb as na + noun rather than na + verb + AUX. There are other verbs that
take affixation either on the auxiliary verb or on the main root, in which
latter case the auxiliary does not co-occur at all (see 18.9).",[137]

and used for emphasis: miro'a 'first' and mama 'next': ho-miro'a 'me first',
i-maina 'you next', hari-miro'a 'us first', a'oni-maina 'you (PL) next'. In the
third person the emphatic pronoun forms co-occur with the particles.
'imidia 'first' is a variant form of miro'a 'first'. Whereas miro'a may occur
with all the persons, 'imidia only occurs with 3SG/PL. It also occurs as a
verb suffix; maina also occurs as a verb suffix, but miro'a never does.(449)   nahina miro'a kara'oha-ha

"18.5.8 The co-occurrence of the prefix ka~ and suffix -hi makes the verb
ditransitive and yields a 'BENEF ACTIVE' meaning. (In this paper, these
affixes are sometimes glossed as 'DITRANSTVZR'.) The direct object
occurs preverbally marked by the enclitic -ra OBJ* and refers to the
beneficiary (a semantically indirect object which can also be expressed as
an oblique clause constituent when there is a na- 'CAUS* prefix in the verb
instead of ka- . , . -hi', cf. (593b) and (593c)). This derivation is more often
applied to an intransitive stem (cf. (593a, c) and (595b)), but can also be
applied to a transitive stem (594a, b). The (semantic) patient, which is the
direct object in the normal transitive clause (593b, 594a, 595a), becomes a
DEMOTED OBJECT in the benefactive ditransitive construction (593c,
594b, 595b). This may be marked as such by the -a 'DEMOTED:O'
enclitic, as in (595b), or it may occur postverbally with a demonstrative but
no other marking (593c, 594b). In this latter case it is not morphologically
distinguished from a postverbal direct object in an ordinary transitive clause
(e.g., 593b, 595a), but it is syntactically distinguished as demoted, rather
than direct, by the co-occurrence of the preverbal direct object marked
with -ra (593c, 594b).(593a) abini-'i-hi     ida arakava

"9.2.4 Use of subject-emphasis pronouns. There are four special third person
pronoun forms used for placing emphasis or focus on the subject referent:
onianiloniaro *3SG,f; οναή *3SG,m'; and va'oniaro '3PL* (sect. 16). They
may occur before or after the verb, and with or without an accompanying
noun phrase referring to the same entity. They are only used to refer to
the subject of the clause.(153)   ovari      Vararibori jaboni ka-raborabo-ki
