2.2    Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbsMost if not all Dogon languages are verb-final, and this is true of Jamsay.
However, the verb can be followed by clause-linking subordinators and certain
discourse particles like ‘only’ with clausal scope. In addition, some normally
preverbal constituents, especially adverbial phrases, are occasionally added (as
afterthoughts or clarifications) after the verb, with an intervening pause.
     Verb stems must respect well-defined restrictions on segmental form and
lexical tones. Regular verbs end in a long vowel if monosyllabic, in a short
vowel if longer. The stem-level lexical tone pattern of a verb can only be all-H
or L(L…)H with H on the final mora.
     In non-imperative, non-focalized main clauses, the verb has the basic
structure (2), omitting some details.(2)      [stem - (derivational suffix)] - aspect/negation - pronominal subjectBeginning with the final element, verbs are inflected for subject person and
number category (1Sg, 1Pl, 2Sg, 2Pl, 3Sg/Nonhuman, 3Pl); see §10.2. The
3Sg/Nonhuman suffix is -Ø. The pronominal subject suffix may be the only
expression of the subject, or it may agree with an unfocalized preverbal NP. In
the unsuffixed Imperfective (positive), Nonhuman subject is distinguished from
(human) 3Sg subject by adding quasi-verb kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’ after the
regular verb stem.
                                          2.2 Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbs   11     Negation is also expressed by verbal suffixation; there are distinct Negative
suffixes for perfective and imperfective verbs, immediately preceding the
pronominal suffixes (hence verb-Neg-pronominal); see §10.1.3. Examples of
positive inflected verbs are in (3.a-b), followed by examples of negative
inflected verbs (3.c-d). Note the zero 3SgS suffix in (3.b).(3)     a. yE$rE@-m$

           go-PerfNeg-1PlS
           ‘We did not go.’    As the interlinear glosses in (3.c-d) suggest, the verbal suffixal system
marks aspect as well as negation; I refer to these as AN (aspect-negation)
categories. The positive categories are listed in (4); the fuller treatment is in
§10.1.2. The division between the two systems is justified by semantics and
textual patterning. For example, the unsuffixed Perfective (in the syntactic
contexts that require it) may correspond to any of several marked perfective-
system categories in other contexts, and the unsuffixed Imperfective is likewise
the unmarked, all-purpose imperfective-system form. Similar neutralizations
occur in negative AN categories.

               [Rdp + final L-tone] reduplicated Imperfective      In the perfective system, the unsuffixed Perfective is the basic form used in
the presence of a focalized constituent, and in relative clauses. In other
(positive) clauses, there is a choice between the Perfective (-ti$-, -yE$-/-ya$-, or
-a^˘-) and the other more specialized categories listed. In the imperfective
system, the unsuffixed Imperfective is the most common form, but it gets some
competition from suffixally marked categories. There is a relatively low-
frequency reduplicated option in both perfective and imperfective systems.
      The importance of tones in distinguishing inflectional categories, and in
distinguishing main from relative clauses, can be brought out by considering the
verb ‘fight’ (5).(5)      lexical        unsuffixed Perfective          unsuffixed Impf Imprt

stem in verb chains, and before non-Negative AN suffixes. The unsuffixed
Perfective undergoes tone-dropping to all-L jE$yE$- in main clauses (after a
focalized constituent), but has the H(H…)L overlay in relative clauses, where it
appears as HL-toned jE@yE$-. The unsuffixed Imperfective is underlying /jE$yE@- L/,
as a final floating L-tone follows the stem; if there is no audible pronominal

vowel (now <HL>-toned) is lengthened to two moras to allow the contour tone
to be expressed. Finally, the Imperative is all-H-toned jE@yE@. In other words, this
CvCv- stem can appear with LH, LL, HL, LF, and HH tones. These tonal
distinctions, while occasionally redundant (LL before Negative suffix), are in
several cases the sole expression of the relevant morphosyntactic category.
      In negative indicative clauses, though some suffixally marked aspects can
occur, aspect tends to be reduced to a simple perfective-imperfective opposition,
expressed by the portmanteau suffixes -li@- (Perfective Negative) and -go@-
(Imperfective Negative); see (3.c-d), above, and §10.1.3. There is a distinct,
aspectually undifferentiated Negative suffix -la@- for adjectives and some stative
verbs and quasi-verbs (§11.4.3), and similar but L-toned Negative morphemes
(la$˘, la$) are used in a few minor constructions (§11.2.1.3-4).
      Imperative verbs (§10.4) have a distinct set of inflections for subject (2Sg
[=zero], 2Pl), and special negative (i.e. prohibitive) forms, as seen in (6) with
verb yE$rE@ ‘come’.(6)     a. yE@rE@

           ‘Come-Sg!’        b. yE@rE@-y$

           come-Imprt.Pl          ImprtNeg.Pl
           ‘Don’t-Pl come!’     There is a Hortative with suffix -m@ (10.4.3).
     There are also a handful of aspectually defective quasi-verbs meaning
‘say’, ‘be’, ‘have’, and ‘be in’ with Cv- and CvC- shapes, which are not
otherwise allowable for Jamsay verb stems. The morphosyntax of the various
elements is variable, and “quasi-verb” is an intentionally vague cover term. In
most cases they occur with L-tone in main clauses and with H(H…)L tone in
relative clauses, which aligns them formally with the unsuffixed Perfective of
regular verbs. Some of the quasi-verbs are segmentally identical to AN suffixes,
suggesting the possibility that the quasi-verb is really just an AN suffix added to
a phonologically empty verb slot. See §11.2.2-3, §11.5.1 for the full coverage.
There are also some stative stance and ‘hold’ verbs that are aspectually
defective, occurring in perfective forms only (§11.2.4, §11.5.2).
14    Sketch
    The ‘say’ verb ga@˘-, quasi-verb jE$-, and quotative particle wa (wa$, wa@)
(§11.3) constitute a complex subject in Jamsay and other Dogon languages.
Some clause-subordinating elements are based on the ‘say’ verb or quasi-verb
(§15.2.2)
2.3    ParticiplesIn relative clauses (and therefore in various spatio-temporal and manner clauses
in relative form, as well as in various agentive compounds), the verb takes a
Participial suffix instead of a pronominal subject suffix (§14.1.8). The
Participial suffixes are Nonhuman -Ø, (human) Sg -n, and (human) Pl -m.
These are the same suffixes used with most simple nouns, and with adjectives.
The Participial suffix agrees with the head of the relative, regardless of its
grammatical relation (subject, object, etc.).
     The verb in a relative clause, if perfective (positive), normally appears in a
special H(H…)L-toned form of the unsuffixed Perfective.
     Because participial agreement is with the head rather than with the subject,
in non-subject relatives some way must be found to express a pronominal
subject. This is accomplished by using a set of L-toned preverbal subject
pronominal proclitics, corresponding functionally to the subject pronominal
suffixes that occur on verbs in main clauses. (These L-toned pronominals are
not used in subject relatives, where the subject is indexed in the participial
ending.)
     Therefore the way to say ‘the place where I saw you’ can be schematized as
(7).(7)      place.L 2SgO     1SgS.L    see.Perf.HL-Ppl.Nonh    The head is ‘place’, so it appears with L-tone (“place.L”). Since this is a
nonhuman noun, we get Nonhuman Participial suffix (“Ppl.Nonh”) on the verb.
There is a 2Sg object pronominal proclitic (H-toned u@), and an L-toned
preverbal subject pronominal proclitic (1Sg mi $). Since the verb is perfective
positive, it appears in the unsuffixed Perfective, with H(H…)L tone contour
overlaid. The actual Jamsay phrase is (8).(8)      di ˘$ <   u@   mi $     E^˘-Ø
2.4    Noun phrase (NP)A full-sized NP could have the linear sequence (9), omitting some details.
                                                                 2.4 Noun phrase     15(9)     a.   possessor NP followed by ma$ ‘of’, or simple pronoun as possessor
        b.   noun stem
        c.   adjective (simple or expanded)
        d.   demonstrative or ‘each, any’ quantifier
        e.   numeral, Pl particle, and/or Definite particle
        f.   ‘all’     The noun stem itself may be a compound. Many human nouns, and
adjectives when referring to a human, take the suffix Sg -n or Pl -m. Human
nouns that for one reason or another cannot take these suffixes (e.g. most kin
terms) may be followed by Pl particle be@. Nonhuman nouns lack morphological
number marking, but they can be followed by be@ to emphasize plurality.
     An example of a fairly complex NP is (10), with the head bolded in the
interlinear. It consists of a possessor, a head noun, two modifying adjectives,
and a Pl morpheme. ‘House’ and ‘small’ undergo tone-dropping to all L-tones
(indicated by “.L” in interlinears) because each is followed by a modifying
adjective. The possessor (1Sg) and the final Pl morpheme be@ do not interact
tonally with the head noun or with the adjectives. One can therefore bracket off
an inner core NP defined by tonal interaction, as opposed to peripheral
elements that have no tonal interaction with the core (tonal independence).(10)    [ma@ [u$ro$      da$ƒa$ pi@ru@] be@]
        [1SgP [house.L small.L white] Pl]
        ‘my small white houses’      More complex examples are given in §6.1; of particular interest are
numerals, which do not interact tonally with preceding nouns and adjectives
(§6.5), and inalienable possessors for kin terms, which force a tone overlay on
the kin term itself (§6.2.2).
      In addition to tonal dependence versus independence, a further issue
relevant to internal NP structure is what happens when a multi-word NP
functions as head of a relative. For example, if (10) is a relative head, as in (11)
below, its first four words remain together (though pi@ru@ drops tones to become
pi r$ u$), but Plural be@ detaches itself and appears at the end of the relative clause,
following the participialized verb (and, usually, Definite ku$<).(11)    [ma@ [u$ro$    da$ƒa$ pi $ru$]] nu@mo$-Ø              ku$< be@
        [1SgP [house.L small.L white.L] fall.Perf.HL-Ppl.Nonh Def Pl
        ‘my small white houses that fell’    There is a partial correlation, among postnominal elements in NPs, between
such detachability and the lack of tonal interaction when adjacent. However,
16    Sketch
the correlation is imperfect; for example, cardinal numerals have no tonal
interaction with preceding nouns, but are not detachable.
     Pronominal categories are 1Sg, 1Pl, 2Sg, 2Pl, 3Sg (human), 3Pl (human),
and Nonhuman. They are expressed as subject-pronominal suffixes on verbs
(with 3Sg and Nonhuman merged as zero in most AN categories), as proclitic-
like particles preceding verbs or postpositions, and as independent pronominals.
Anaphorics include a Reflexive pronoun i n   $ i $w<e@ (§18.1), a set of expressions
of the type ‘my/your/his head’ with reflexive-like functions (§18.1.3), and a
noun-like morpheme E$nE@ (plural E$nE@ be@) that is used both for third person
reflexive possessor (‘he killed his own dog’, §18.1.2) and, in third-person
reported speech and thought, as a syntactically unrestricted logophoric pronoun
coindexed with the quoted author (‘she said/thought [she would come]’,
§18.2.1).","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]"

          ‘It’s we [focus] who go to bed here.’    There is also a great deal of topicalization in Jamsay discourse (§19.1).
NPs and independent pronouns are regularly placed to the left of a sentence,
usually with at least some prosodic break. The sentence proper usually has
pronouns coindexed to these presentential topical NPs (17). This is especially
diagnostic of topicalization in the case of objects, since a pronominal object is
not used in addition to a clause-mate nonpronominal object NP. Many times,
what looks at first sight like a clause-internal NP in subject or object function is
actually a presentential topic.(17)      [i n

possessors. This applies to Verbal Noun clauses (§17.4), and to the unusual
‘before …’ construction (§15.2.4.2) in which the verb has a suffix -wv$ with
underspecified vowel. Pronominal subjects are expressed by preverbal
possessor pronominals. The basic ordering pattern is (18).(18)    nominalized clause        1.   adverbials
        2.   subject (pronominal or nonpronominal), expressed as possessor
        3.   dative, object (expressed as possessor or object), adverbials
        4.   verb with nominalizing suffix     This can be summarized roughly as Adv-S(Poss)-X-V; an example is (19).
The logical subject (2Sg pronoun) is expressed as a special kind of possessor
only used with nominalized verbs, viz., independent pronoun (H-toned)
followed by Possessive ma$ (which is not used after pronominals in tensed
clauses). The object ‘chicken’ has normal object tone (rather than the tone
typical of compound initials) since it is not immediately preverbal. It is
followed by a dative pronominal (as usual, pronominals gravitate to immediate
preverbal position), then the Verbal Noun of ‘give’.(19)    u@   ma$     E$nE) @   wo$-ru@ o$-y@

2.8    Relative clausesIn relatives (chapter 14), the verb has a participial suffix of nominal type instead
of a pronominal subject suffix. There is usually an overt internal head NP whose
last word undergoes tone-dropping, but the head can be in any grammatical
relation. The head appears in its usual place in the sentence (there is no
systematic fronting of heads). If the subject is pronominal (and not the head), it
is expressed by a special L-toned preverbal subject pronominal proclitic in
immediate preverbal position. This is connected with the fact that the normal
morphological slot for pronominal-subject suffixes (at the end of the verb) is
occupied by the participial suffix (which agrees with the head NP, not the
subject). The basic order of elements is as in (20).

             ‘(at) the time when I fed him for you-Sg’     Let us consider (21.a) in detail. It begins with a temporal noun ‘day’ in
L-toned form, which tells us that this noun is the head of the relative. There is
then an H-toned pronominal for the object (as would be the case in a main
clause), followed by an L-toned subject pronominal (which is unique to
relatives and a few other subordinated clause types). The participial is based on
a Perfective verb, which in relatives takes the form of an unsuffixed Perfective
stem with overlaid H(H…)L tone. Since the head is Nonhuman, the Nonhuman
Participial suffix -Ø is used.
     In the interlinears, “.L” after a gloss or label indicates that tone-dropping
has occurred, and “.HL” indicates that a H(H…)L tone contour has been
overlaid. The 2Sg object (“2SgO”) pronoun here has its lexical H-tone, so the
interlinear includes no (grammatical) tonal information.
     The importance of pronominal tones in parsing relative clauses is brought
out by comparing (22.a-b). Preverbal pronominals (if not focalized or
topicalized) follow nonpronominal NPs, so 1Sg object mi@ in (22.a) and 1Sg
                                                            2.8 Relative clauses   21subject mi $ in (22.b) directly precede the verb. There is no structural case
marking of nonpronominal NPs, so ‘white person’ has the same form as subject
in (22.a) and as object in (22.b). The verb in a relative is a participle that agrees
only with the head, which is here neither subject nor object, rather the noun
‘day’. So only the tonal difference between mi@ and mi $ differentiates the two
sentences.(22)    a. ni N

           ‘the day (when) I saw the white person’     Another typologically remarkable feature of Jamsay relatives is that the
head noun is often copied after the main part of the relative clause, after a
Possessive morpheme. In other words, relatives can be double-headed (with
one internal and one external instance of the head noun); see §14.1.1. This
expanded type can be represented schematically as (23). No intelligible literal
English translation would clarify it much, but think of ‘the dog that bit me’ as
something like ‘dog of [the dog that bit me]’. Neither instance of the head noun
is pronominalized.","[40, 41, 42, 43]"

8 Postpositions and adverbials
Jamsay makes use of postpositions for dative and spatiotemporal cases. The
purest postposition, bearing no relationship to any noun, is le$, which has several
grammatical functions. Several other postpositions are based on noun stems.
These include complex postpositions that themselves consist of a noun plus
postposition, requiring a complement in the form of a possessor (cf. English at
the back of…). There are also some postpositions in the form of a noun with an
overlaid locative H(H…)L tone melody (tonal locatives).
     A postpositional phrase (PP) is of the basic form [NP Postposition], but it
may be extended by adding a universal quantifier cE^w or fu@˘ ‘all’ (in emphatic
sense), or by a particle like ka^˘< ‘also’. (435.a) has fu@˘ after a PP, in a different
sense than we get when fu@˘ occurs at the end of the NP complement of the
postposition (435.b). (435.c) illustrates ka^˘< ‘also’ (§19.1.3). (435.d) has cE^w
‘all’ after a PP, and also shows how a PP can be treated like a noun, specifically

numerous lexical adverbials in Jamsay. Some of these are noun-like, e.g. words
with senses like ‘yesterday’, which (in their adverbial function) can be thought
of as covert PPs with a zero postposition, just as in English (yesterday for ?on
yesterday). However, there are other adverbials of a more protean variety, not
easily connected to any other stem-class. These include intensifiers associated
with adjectives (§6.3.3.2), and an interesting set of expressive adverbials, some
examples of which are given in §8.5.8. The intensifiers and expressive
adverbials resemble regular adjectives in their ability to occur in predicative
function with a following ‘be’ quasi-verb, but even here the similarity is
superficial, in that the usual negative (‘not be’) counterparts are different; see
§11.4.3. Adverbials, even though some have adjective-like sense (e.g. ‘straight’,
‘tilting’), are not used in adnominal modifying function and do not take number
suffixes.","[303, 304, 305]"

1.1   Dogon languagesDogon is a family of languages spoken principally in eastern Mali, though some
Dogon groups have spread across the border into Burkina Faso. As a whole, the
family belongs to the vast Niger-Congo phylum, but its precise position relative
to other Niger-Congo families (e.g. Mande, Gur) is very unclear at this point.
The internal structure of the Dogon family is also very unclear, as is the number
of mutually unintelligible languages it contains.
     The French colonial administration, having little interest in small native
languages, favored (macro-)ethnic over (precise) linguistic classification, hence
“Dogon” rather than e.g. “Jamsay,” and labeled linguistic varieties within each
such macro-ethnicity as “dialects,” a tradition maintained even in current
Francophone scholarship. For similar reasons, (macro-)ethnic classification
suits African governments fine. The official language policy in Mali, for
example, is to equate “language” with (macro-)ethnicity, select the linguistic
variety spoken in a particular focal community as standard, develop pedagogical
materials in this variety, and teach it as “mother tongue” to schoolchildren and
interested adults everywhere who belong to this ethnicity. In the case of Dogon,
the Toro-So variety of the Sanga area was chosen as standard Dogon and is the
basis of government-approved literacy efforts in the region.
     Using the test of mutual unintelligibility as diagnostic, on the other hand,
there are clearly many distinct Dogon languages in Mali. We do not yet have
Dogon-wide data in a form that would permit demarcation of language
boundaries and accurate genetic subgroupings. However, having surveyed the
varieties spoken in the northern and northeastern parts of Dogon country, I can
report the following as distinct languages, using the towns of Dountza and Boni
(primarily Fulfulde-speaking) and Koro (Dogon and Mossi) as geographical
reference points:
1. Jamsay (aka Diamsay), see below;
2. Beni, spoken in Beni and Gamni south of Dianwely Maoudé, and in
Kumboy village hugging Fombori mountain between Beni and Douentza;
3. Walo, close genetically to Beni, spoken in Walo at the western end of the
long Gandamiya inselberg (on the opposite side of which is Kikara, where the
Songhay language Tondi Songway Kiini is spoken);
4. Nanga (naNa), spoken in a village cluster including Anda, Soroni,
Namakoro, Wakara, and Kono southwest of Beni and broadly east of the
2 IntroductionTommo-So (Tombo-So) speaking zone that begins at Kasa and extends to
Bandiagara;
5. Tabi-Sarinyere, spoken by the people sometimes called Tandam, east of the
town Boni (which is just off the highway, between Douentza and Hombori), in
several villages ringing the widely separated inselbergs of Tabi and Sarinyere,
plus a few small villages and one substantial one (Koyo) on the two inselbergs
framing Boni itself;
6. Najamba (= Bondu), spoken in a cluster of villages west and southwest of
Douentza including Koubewel, Adia.
     After the initial failure of government-supported instruction in Toro-So in
Dogon villages of the Douentza-Boni zone, local groups have launched literacy
programs in Jamsay and Bondu and these are now being taught in primary
schools. Aside from its own mother-tongue villages, Jamsay is being taught in
the Tabi area (whose people have long known Jamsay as a second language,
since Mondoro is not far away). The children of Beni have been attending
school in Jamsay-speaking Dianwely Maoudé, where Jamsay is of course used,
pending the construction of its own school. Jamsay is slowly acquiring the
status of a locally dominant “standard” Dogon in the Douentza-Boni region.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"(311)    Order within NP (first approximation)         a. alienable possessor (NP plus ma$, or H-toned pronominal possessor)         b. (b1 and b2 do not co-occur)
              b1. discourse-definite demonstrative ko$ ‘that’
              b2. inalienable possessor NP, or L-toned pronominal possessor         c. noun (most human nouns have overt Sg or Pl suffix)         d. one or more modifying adjectives (if human, with Sg or Pl suffix)
                                               6.1 Organization of NP constituents   225        e. (e1 and e2 do not co-occur)
             e1. distributive quantifier ka^˘< ‘each’
             e2. deictic demonstrative nu@No$ ‘this/that’        f. (for ordering within f, see below)
             f1. Pl be@ (used if noun does not mark plurality with a suffix)
             f2. Definite ku$<
             f3. cardinal numeral        g. universal quantifier ‘all’ (fu@˘, cE^w)     The distributive quantifier ka^˘< ‘each’ and the demonstrative nu@No$
‘this/that’ do not co-occur, so I cannot order (e1) and (e2) relative to each other.
In practice, ka^˘< ‘each’ nearly always occurs in simple NPs of the shape [noun
+ ka^˘<] with no other modifiers. The combination [noun + adjective + ka^˘<] is
elicitable in the relevant sense (with tone-dropping on the adjective as well as
on the noun), but uncommon, unless a further cE^w ‘all’ is added to insure the
quantificational reading of ka^˘<. Perhaps the tendency to avoid NP-final
quantifier ka^˘< after an already complex NP reflects a homonym clash with ka^˘<
‘also, too’ (variant ka@r<a$), which does occur freely after NPs of any shape. To
be sure, ka^˘< ‘each’ and ka^˘< ‘also, too’ have different tonal effects; ka^˘< ‘each’
induces tone-dropping on the preceding word, while ka^˘˘< ‘also, too’ has no
tonal effect.
     There is some variation in ordering within (311.f) area. (f2) and (f3) may
occur in either order. (f1) and (f2) may likewise occur in either order. However,
(f3) must follow (f1) if both are present.
     The two demonstratives, discourse-definite in (311.b) and deictic in (311.e),
do not often co-occur, but their combination is grammatical.
     Examples are in (312), with the noun heading the NP bolded. The positions
in (311) that are filled in each example are listed in parentheses on the right. I
use _ in these formulae to indicate unfilled slots, with (e) and (f) counted as one
slot each. (312.a) has two adjectives in position (d).(312)   a. ma@    u$ro$     da$ƒa$ pi@ru@             be@      (a _ c d(2) _ f1 _)

6.1.2     Headless NPs (absolute function of demonstratives, etc.)Headless NPs, those where the head noun is omitted and not replaced by a
personal pronoun, are (apparently) headed by another element in the NP. (For a
similar omission of head NPs in relatives, see §14.1.6). The examples of
headless NPs involve deictic demonstrative nu@No$, cardinal numerals, and
adjectives. One could argue that such phrases involve a zeroed noun as head.
     In this absolute function, demonstrative nu@No$ is the most common of the
bunch, since there is no other way to express (deictic) ‘this/that’. Cardinal
numerals and adjectives are only occasionally absolute; much more often there
is a noun, even a semantically “light” one like ‘thing’ or ‘person’.
     Examples, mostly elicited, of various elements in absolute function are in
(313.a-d). (313.e) has a possessor, a modifying adjective, and a numeral.(313)     a. nu@No$      mi&-n        e$l-la@-Ø

           ‘Give me my two red ones!’ (uncommon)    Demonstrative ko$ arguably occurs as a one-word NP in a few examples (i.e.
with zero nominal head). However, the available examples have an alternative
parsing with L-toned preverbal subject pronominal ko$, which is syntactically
possible for subjects of relative clauses and some other subordinated clause
types. In (314), for example, I take ko$ to be an L-toned preverbal subject, which
can occur in conditional antecedent clauses (§16.1.2).(314)   ko$                go@˘-ya$-Ø         ta@Na$˘    de$y

e.g. English mine, French le mien, etc., has a semantically light possessed noun
ce@ ‘possession’ as head. This form, presumably related to cE&˘ ‘thing’, also
occurs in possessive constructions of the type ‘X is Y’s possession’, i.e., ‘X
belongs to Y’ (§11.5.3). ce@ is an inalienably possessed noun, requiring L-toned
possessor pronominals or a possessor NP without Possessive ma$ (§6.2.1). In
(315.b), ‘theirs’ denotes the girls’ excision ritual, which is parallel to the boys’
circumcision, which was described in the preceding discourse (both are referred
to as “causing to drink porridge”).(315)   a. [mi $   ce@]            n)çw

             2004.3.18     This construction is confined to cases where the referent object is
nonhuman. Efforts to elicit a human counterpart, whether alienable (‘boss’) or
inalienable (‘father’), were unsuccessful. For example, ‘his boss/father is good,
mine is bad’ was always translated with the referent noun repeated e.g. (‘his
boss is good, my boss is bad’).
     Universal quantifiers are not used absolutely as NPs. However, both fu@˘ and
cE^w can occur with a preceding Nonhuman pronoun ko@ (with tone dropped to
ko$) in the relevant sense; (316.a) illustrates this for fu@˘. The emphatic adverbial
so@y ‘all, everything, totally’ can be used absolutely, as a kind of NP substitute

6.1.3     Detachability (in relatives)There is a distinction between those postnominal elements that remain with the

the relative clause (after the participle).(317)     a. remain within head NP

            universal and distributive quantifiers    As explained in Chapter 14, the head NP does not move out of the clause,
instead, its status as relative head is signalled by tone-dropping. The relative
clause ends in a participialized verb with noun-like suffixes agreeing in number
and humanness with the head NP, so the entire clause is morphologically
nominal. (A second copy of the head noun may appear after the relative-clause
proper, following Possessive ma$, but this is not relevant to the present point).

    In cases like (320) it might seem that Pl be@ stays within the head NP.
However, be$ here is really the L-toned 3Pl subject pronominal (used in relative
clauses), and has nothing to do with the noun i n
                                                $ e$ ‘person’ (which functions as
direct object within the clause). However, there are rare examples where Pl be@
does seem to remain within the head NP, in which case it (like the head noun)
undergoes tone-dropping; see (849.e).(320)     i $ne$       be$     a^˘-m

after the participle. My examples of the second option, however, involve
somewhat frozen relatives of the ‘oil for rubbing’ type (§5.1.15) with
impersonal 3Pl subject. In (321.a-c), note that la$ƒa@ induces tone-dropping on
the participles, which would otherwise be ba^˘-Ø, ka@r<a^˘-Ø, and di N

dropping applies after Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141) (§3.7.4.1), which
lengthens the stem-final short vowel in the participles of (321.b-c). (321.d) is
the variant of (321.c) with la$ƒa@ inside the head NP.(321)     a. di ˘$ <   be$     ba$˘-Ø                     la$ƒa@ de@y<

6.1.4     Internal bracketing and tone-droppingIn addition to the order of words within NP’s, we must also pay attention to tone
patterns. The NP-internal combinations in (322) require the item on the left to
drop tones to all-L. Here, the item on the left is tonally dependent on the item

equally well as locative (English on foot) or as instrumental (English by foot).

3.2.2     Embryonic metrical structureMany languages have stress or accent systems, which generally have at least a
partially undulating, rhythmical nature (alternating stress rules, clash avoidance,
etc.). Jamsay is a tone language, whose tones are important both lexically and
grammatically. Unlike the case in other (non-Dogon) tone languages of the area,
in Jamsay there is no “tone sandhi” across word boundaries. In native
vocabulary, long words may consist entirely of metrically light, monomoraic Cv
syllables. For these reasons, there is no phonetically obvious metrical structure
of the sort we observe in English.
     However, an embryonic metrical structure is manifested in various
phonological rules, particularly those applying to verb stems and their suffixal
derivatives (including Verbal Nouns). The core sequence involved is a stem-
initial bisyllabic [] foot behaving metrically as a trochee [sw], i.e., with a
metrically strong 1 followed by a weak 2. Squared brackets demarcate
metrical feet. Depending on the phonological process in question, there may be
further stipulations on one or both of these syllables (e.g. as to vowel length), or
a following third syllable may be required. There is no clear evidence for
metrical structure in the third, fourth, and fifth syllables of long, uncompounded
stems or words.
     The phonological processes that are at least arguably sensitive to the initial
[sw] asymmetry are those in (28). For each, I give a brief summary (often
oversimplified) of the content of the process, name the morphological
categories affected, and a schematic representation of the relevant structure
                          3.2 Internal phonological structure of stems and words   27(with the targeted segment underlined). In the schemas,  is used for a syllable
that can be of any shape, i.e. initial (C)v(˘)C and noninitial Cv(˘)C, while more
specific representations like (C)v (optional C plus short vowel) are used when
the process requires.(28)    a. g-Spirantization (§3.3.2)

             process: mid-height V2 {e E) or (o ç} raised to i or u
             domain: suffixally derived verbs (e.g. causative)
             relevant structure: [Cv]-[Cv-     (28.a) is a consonantal lenition that occurs at the onset of 2 (but not e.g.
3). (28.b-e) are vocalic deletions and other lenitions. (28.b,d) are strictly
limited to 2, (28.c) is very strongly associated with 2 though it applies rarely
(in elicitation only) to later syllables; and (28.e) can apply equally to 2 or a
later syllable but there are very few opportunities for it to apply to a later
syllable. (28.f) is not obviously a lenition process, but since raising is associated
28      Phonology
with lenition in (28.e) one could make a case that (28.f) too is a lenition of sorts;
it applies only to 2.
     The relevant structures in (28.a-f) are sufficiently divergent to show that no
fixed “underlying” metrical structure can account for all the data. 2 is always
centrally involved, but the lenitions are in some cases extended to immediately
following syllables. Only (28.a,d) affect stems of all word classes, while
(28.b-c, e-f) apply only to verb stems (including Verbal Nouns derived from
them).
     If the metrical structure were better developed, one would expect some kind
of undulating stress, so that e.g. a five-syllable word would have an audible
organization into metrical feet, e.g. [sw][sw] (with extra-metrical final
syllable). This is not the case.
     A probably related tone-lowering occurs in the second verb stem in certain
types of chains, including iterations (repetitions) of the same stem. This tone-
lowering applies at the level of words (or stems), not syllables. See §15.1.1 and
§16.6.2.","[48, 49, 50]"

2.1   ProsodyPrevious published and unpublished descriptions of Dogon languages have
regularly commented that some form of lexical tone or accent is present, and
that it is subject to grammatical modification. However, no previous study has
actually analysed the prosodic system of a Dogon language.
     In Jamsay, tone (lexical and grammatical) and intonation (including
grammaticalized intonation patterns) play a central role. Indeed, I know of no
(non-Dogon) language where prosody is so tightly integrated with the
morphosyntax. Working on Jamsay has deepened my conviction that currently
dominant grammatical theories, with their sharp compartmentalization of
“phonology” and “syntax,” are badly misguided.
     The prosodic ingredients are given in (1). H[igh] and L[ow] are the
primitives of the tonal system. F[alling] and R[ising] are abbreviations for two-
part contour tones <HL> and <LH>, respectively.(1)     a. lexical tones for stems

                      —end of word preceding universal quantifier fu@˘ ‘all’       The contribution of tonal and intonational elements to Jamsay grammar is
therefore vast. Jamsay does with prosody much of what other languages do with
grammatical morphemes, or with morphosyntactic restructurings including
linear movement. Three examples: 1) most pronouns (excluding suffixes on
verbs) show no variation in segmental form across independent, subject, object,
and possessor categories, but use tones to make some distinctions (e.g. 3Pl be@
for independent, object, and alienable possessor, but be$ for subject and
inalienable possessor). 2) NP’s X and Y are normally conjoined in Jamsay
simply as [X Y], with no conjunction morpheme but with dying-quail final
intonation on both conjuncts. 3) the difference between main and relative
clauses is largely (though not entirely) expressed by tonal modifications. In
relatives, the (internal) head is not fronted. Instead, the final word of the head
NP drops its tones, a pronominal subject is expressed (in non-subject relatives)
by a preverbal L-toned pronominal, and Perfective verbs have the H(H…)L tone
overlay. There are also Participial suffixes, but since the form for Nonhuman
head is -Ø (zero), as is the 3Sg subject form in main clauses, the Participial
suffix cannot be relied on as an audible indicator of relative-clause status.
       At the lexical level, tone is also important. Most native Jamsay words are
built up with Cv and Cv˘ syllables, with a smattering of CvC and a few Cv˘C
and extra-long Cv˘˘ syllables. Cv is monomoraic (=has one mora or syllabic
weight unit), Cv˘ and CvC are bimoraic, and Cv˘C and Cv˘˘ are trimoraic. Each
mora can have its own tonal primitive, H[igh] or L[ow], so a monomoraic
syllable can be only H or L, a bimoraic syllable can be H, L, F (= <HL>), or R
(= <LH>), and a trimoraic syllable can be any of the above or bell-shaped
<LHL>. There are some minimal pairs such as di@gE@ ‘bird’s leg’ versus d i $gE@
‘row’, ç$˘r<ç@ ‘monkey’ versus ç&˘r<ç$ ‘waterskin’, and ci@rE@ ‘horn’ versus ci$rE@
‘hard wood’. Many word families include a noun and a related verb that differ
in tone. For example, the HH-toned noun bi@rE@ ‘work’ is associated with the
LH-toned verb bi r$ E@- ‘work’, and the two regularly combine in the VP bi@rE@
bi r$ E@- ‘work, do some work’.
10    Sketch
     While lexical and grammatical tones have a competitive relationship (stem-
wide tonal overlays completely erase lexical tones), there is an important sense
in which lexical and grammatical tones work together. The requirement that all
stems have at least one H makes it possible to use stem-wide tone-dropping (to
all-L) as a reliable indicator of morphosyntactic function (e.g. head of relative).
The other common stem-wide tone overlay, H(H…)L, is always audible with
verbs, whose lexical forms are tonally all-H or {LH}, and usually audible with
nouns and other stems, since only a minority of these have lexical {HL}
contours.
     The all-H tone overlay is less reliably audible in Jamsay, which has many
lexically all-H verb and noun stems. For example, there is an all-H overlay for
imperative verbs of some shapes; it is audible for lexical {LH} but not for
lexical all-H stems. However, among the various types of participle-final
agentive compounds, the type with all-H final does clearly contrast with the
others, which are based either on the unsuffixed Perfective with H(H…)L
overlaid tone or on the unsuffixed Imperfective with final-syllable F-tone.","[29, 30, 31, 32]"

5.1.15 Instrumental relative compounds (‘oil for rubbing’)The phrasal compounds in this section have the form of relative clauses (of
variable degree of frozenness) with impersonal 3Pl subject, an L-toned head
noun, and an unsuffixed Imperfective participle with Nonhuman Participial -Ø
suffix. The L-toned head noun often represents an instrument associated with
the activity, but there is no overt case-marking specifying instrumental or other
function. I will refer to it as the ‘oil for rubbing’ construction. An example is
(294).(294)    [[gu$ju$   be$          i $n)e˘^ -Ø]

passages where the 3Pl is mis-matched to e.g. a 3Sg (295.a) or 2Sg (295.b)
protagonist who would be the logical user of the item.(295)   a. [E@mE@ a$-n       ga&-n] sa$ri^˘      jE$˘rE@ ga@˘ ka^n,

by verbs are carried out using the instrument (baskets). In (296.b), only the
second verb ‘put’ involves the instrument (baskets again), though admittedly
‘cut’ and ‘put’ refer to actions that are closely integrated. In other cases, a single
verbal idea is expressed by a two-verb sequence, as with the borrowed French
stem utiliser ‘use’ (not directly inflectable) plus inflectable ‘do’ in (296.c).

216     Nominal and adjectival compounds
     In the constructions given above, the imperfective verb has only one
argument, represented by the L-toned noun. However, the verb may have two
arguments, often a direct object (=patient) and an instrument, the latter being
the head. In this case, the direct object immediately precedes be$, and takes its
regular tones (i.e. it does not undergo tone-dropping). The instrumental head
noun N1 can be incorporated in either of two ways. First, it can be added in the
form [ma$ N1] after the remainder of the construction. This (uncommon)
construction is structurally equivalent to a “headless” relative clause followed
by [ma$ N1] containing the only occurrence of the head noun, a pattern attested,
but not very common, in other relative clauses; see (802) in (§14.1.1). The
second construction, considerably more common, is to prepose the instrumental
noun in L-toned form to the remainder of the construction, which can be
thought of as a postnominal modifier (i.e., an expanded adjective). This is
essentially just an expansion of the type illustrated above, with the extra direct
object noun following the L-toned head.
     Both the instrumental [ma$ N1] add-on option, and the preposed L-toned
instrumental option, are exemplified in (297). This is from a longer passage
listing several earthenware (pottery) products made by women of the blacksmith
caste. The instrumental nouns are bolded in the interlinears.(297)    [[ni@˘ be$        i $ne^˘-Ø]           ma$ wE$˘rE@] be@ ma&˘ $,

pE@˘rE$ ‘small bowl’ in the preceding example, is by far the more common.

the universal quantifier cE^w, which is preferentially adjacent to the noun that it
has direct scope over.(299)   [ni $˘     [ka@˘   le$] be$      nç&˘ $-Ø]        ma$ ni@˘   cE^w

describing various items that must be offered to the bride at the time she is
ceremonially transferred (in a large and boisterous parade) from her own home
to her husband’s. The final ‘oil for rubbing’ is straightforward, but it is preceded
by a much more complex instance of the construction.(300)   [wo@      ku^˘<]          [yi $ru$      pi r$ u$] be$    go$ro@ me$y<

        garment and (=while) conveying her (to her husband’s home) as a
        newlywed, (and) you-Pl will take oil for rubbing.’ 2004.3.20    Instead of a simple sequence based on [noun.L object they.L VERB.Impf]
(‘a garment for covering her’), the phrase headed by ‘(white) garment’ is
elaborated by chaining the VP ending in ‘cover’ with a second VP denoting the
218     Nominal and adjectival compounds
transfer of the bride. The 3Sg pronominal denoting the bride, who is the logical
object of ‘cover’ as well as of ‘take (=convey)’, is expressed only in the ‘take’
VP. This gives us a schematic pattern (301) for the relevant part of (300).(301)    [[on her head] [garment.L white.L] they.L cover and]
             [as-newlywed her they.L transfer.Impf]     The two cases of L-toned preverbal 3Pl subject be$ in this part of the
construction are arguably of different natures referentially. The first, following
‘white garment’, is the impersonal and invariant 3Pl mentioned above, while the
second is perhaps a regular 3Pl pronoun referring to the people accompanying
the bride in the parade.
     (301) is then complicated further by adding a [ma$ NP] phrase, with
Possessive ma$ plus a repeat of the NP functioning as head of the relative (here,
‘white garment’, simplified to ‘garment’). Such head repetition is common in
relative clauses, but all my other examples of the [ma$ NP] add-on involve just
an unmodified noun following ma$ (§14.1.1). The expected form of the add-on
in (300) would therefore have been just ma$ yi $ru@ with the noun ‘garment’.
However, the speaker elaborated this by including repetitions of 3Pl subject be$,
the verb go$ro@- ‘cover’ (now in unsuffixed Imperfective rather than chained
bare-stem form), and Definite ku$<. The final structure as seen in (300) is
therefore (302), where the two occurrences of the head are bolded.(302)    [[[on her head] [garment.L white.L] they.L cover and]
             [as-newlywed her they.L transfer.Impf]]
         of [garment.L they.L cover-Impf]     Though productive and expandible, as the last example shows, the
construction lends itself to lexicalization, since it often denotes a common
implement or container. In some cases, it seems best to write the combination as
a single hyphenated word. For example, (303.a) could be parsed literally as
‘heart for fighting a fight (with)’, but has a lexicalized sense denoting a
personality trait. ‘Slingshot’ (303.b) contains 3Pl subject be$ and unmarked
Imperfective ta^˘<- ‘shoot’; the initial is ma@na$, whose basic sense is ‘plastic’,
most often referring to the lightweight shopping bags found in markets, though
it can also mean ‘slingshot’.(303)    a. cE$nE$-jE@y-be$-jE$yE^˘-Ø

     E$˘-mi@-te@˘re@ ‘time when millet begins to develop ears’ is from E@- ‘see’, 1Sg
mi@, and te@˘re@- ‘show’. The “syntax” here is somewhat opaque, but it can be
taken to have a literal meaning ‘see (it) and show (it) to me’. It reflects the
curiosity among Jamsay farmers as to the timing of the first appearance of
millet ears (seed spikes) during the growing season. Of course the ears appear
first in a few plants within a field, and in one field before another field, so there
is much interest in the first reports of ear development.","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241]"

15.2.4.1 Noun-headed temporal clause (‘the time when …’)One straightforward temporal clause is formally a relative construction headed
by a noun meaning ‘time’, ‘day’, or the like. The clause is therefore
syntactically an NP. Typical head nouns are do@gu@ru@ ‘time’, wa@ka@ti $ ‘time’
(from Arabic via Fulfulde), and ni@-Ni@r<e@ ‘day’. The following features are
required by the relative clause structure: a) the head noun appears with all-L
tone; b) an unsuffixed Perfective verb has H(H…)L, while imperfective-system
verb stems have their usual tone; and c) subject pronominals are preverbal
rather than suffixed to the verb.

15.2.4.2 ‘Before …’ clauses with pseudo-causative nominalJamsay has a remarkable construction to express ‘before …’ clauses. The
propositional content may be factive (as in ‘before the rain fell, we were able to
get inside the shelter’) or irrealis (‘I managed to run away before the elephant
trampled [=could trample] me’). For its use in expressions meaning ‘on this side
of X’, see (224). The construction is characterized by the formal features in
(938).(938)   a. the verb takes the form of a pseudo-causative nominal;
        b. this nominal is followed by postposition le$ ‘in, with’;
        c. chained verbs immediately preceding the pseudo-causative nominal
              appear as L-toned compound initials;
        d. multiple NP and adverbial arguments may appear as possessors:
560     Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clauses
              —an inner argument (immediately preceding the pseudo-causative
                nominal) often appears in alienable possessor form (pronominal
                in alienable possessor form without ma$, or a noun-headed NP
                plus Possessive ma$)
              —outer arguments (not adjacent to the pseudo-causative nominal)
                often appear with Possessive ma$ not only with NPs (where ma$
                is expected) but also with independent pronouns     In its treatment of NP arguments, the ‘before …’ construction shows
syntactic similarities to Verbal Noun complements, the other major subor-
dinated clause type in Jamsay that is based on a nominalized verb (§17.4). A
subtle difference is that the VblN is more prone than the pseudo-causative
nominal to form compounds.
     The (final) verb in the ‘before …’ construction takes pseudo-causative
form, with H-toned stem followed by an L-toned suffix -wv$ (with vowel quality
taken from the final stem vowel). The overall tone pattern is therefore H(H…)L.
For the form of the pseudo-causative, see §9.3. The pseudo-causative “verb” is
morphosyntactically a noun (it is followed by a postposition, and it may be
preceded by a possessor).
     In the ‘before …’ construction, the pseudo-causative nominal is followed
by le$. Elsewhere, this is an all-purpose postposition, in context variably
locative, dative, or instrumental (§8.2.1). I will gloss it in interlinears as ‘in’, but
this is arbitrary, and there is no way to determine which of the postpositional
readings (locative, etc.) is relevant here.
     In ‘before …’ clauses based on intransitive verbs, the logical subject
appears in possessor form, hence with ma$ if a noun-headed NP (939.d-e),
otherwise with the regular H-toned alienable possessor pronominal (939.a-c,
f-h). If a chained verb immediately precedes the pseudo-causative verb, it
appears as an L-toned compound initial; see ‘come’ in (939.a) and sa@ra@- ‘pass’

subject is overtly specified, we get the same simple alienable possessive
construction as in intransitives where only the subject is expressed. This time
the logical direct object is the possessor (940). I have no examples of this
subject-less version with a pronominal object.

          (=brideprice)’ (-pa$g-u@) 2004.3.20     Now consider what happens when both the logical subject and the logical
object are overtly expressed. The linear order is normally subject-object-verb.
This ordering is common even when the subject is a pronoun (violating the
usual principle, enforced in main clauses, that preverbal subject pronominals
immediately precede the verb). It is also possible (but less common) for a
pronominal subject to follow an object (see below).
     In the normal subject-object-verb ordering, the object is the inner
(immediately preverbal) argument. It may appear in its regular (i.e. main-
clause) direct-object form, or in the form of an alienable possessor
(nonpronominal NP plus ma$, or the alienable possessor form of a pronoun).
     The subject is the outer argument in the normal subject-object-verb
ordering. It is most often treated as a special kind of outer possessor. If the
subject is a pronoun, it normally appears as an independent pronoun plus
ma$, for example 2Sg u@ ma$, 1Sg mi@ ma$, and 3Sg wo@ ma$; see (941.a-e), below.
Such a combination never occurs in main clauses, where pronominal possessors
are expressed without ma$ by either H-toned alienable possessor forms (2Sg a@,
1Sg ma@, 3Sg wo@, etc.) or L-toned inalienable possessor forms (2Sg u$, 1Sg mi $,
3Sg wo$, etc.). The only other construction where Possessive ma$ follows an
indepedent pronoun is Verbal Noun complement clauses (§17.4).
     If the object is pronominal, the object appears in either (alienable)
possessor (941.a-c,g) or regular direct-object form (941.d,f), e.g. 1Sg
possessor ma@ or direct-object mi@. The difference between possessor and object
series is audible only for the 2Sg, 1Sg, and Logophoric pronominals. Other
pronominals like 3Sg wo@ and 1Pl E@mE@ are ambiguous between possessor and
object, hence the noncommittal P/O in interlinears (941.e).(941)     a. [be@ ma$]       ma@        la@ƒa@-wa$      le$

stacked-possessor construction of the form [[subject ma$] [[object ma$] pseudo-
causative]]], as in (942). This resembles the [[pronoun ma$] [possessor-pronoun
verb]] pattern in (941.a-c), above.(942)   [mi $       de^˘]     ma$ [a@ra@    ma$     sa@˘ku$]   ma$

variants are observed. First, the subject NP may be topicalized, then resumed
by a possessor pronominal (943.a), which reduces the bulkiness of the
‘before …’ clause proper. Second, the object NP may appear in normal object
form, i.e. without a following Possessive ma$ (943.b-c).(943)   a. [mi $     de^˘]         [a@ra@   ma$     sa@˘ku$]

outer possessor, with ma$). The subject is realized as a simple (alienable)
possessor pronominal. This allows ‘before …’ clauses to approximate the main-
clause linearization pattern whereby pronominals (unless emphatic or
topicalized) follow nonpronominal NP’s. However, since the subject-object-
verb order is normal in ‘before …’ clauses, object-fronting may create parsing
difficulties (misidentification of subject and object roles). With verbs like
‘slaughter’ (944.a), the asymmetry between subject and object makes mis-
parsing unlikely. The reading for (944.b) is unlikely for the same reason; see the
more usual reading (941.g). (944.c) is more seriously ambiguous. My
impression is that object-fronting is uncommon in natural speech, especially
when both subject and object are pronominal.(944)     a. [pe@˘ju@   ma$]      ma@       cE@˘<-w<E$         le$

added, usually with a following Possessive ma$ (which is absent in
corresponding main clauses). Examples of pronominal and NP datives with ma$
are in (945). In (945.b-d), the pronominal subject does not have possessor form;
instead, it appears as an L-toned preverbal subject pronominal, immediately
before the verb (945.b), or as an H-toned independent pronoun, when separated
from the verb (945.c-d). The option to add Possessive ma$ after an adverb is

causative ‘before’ verb with suffix -wv$. In this case, if there is a preceding
chained verb, this chained verb cannot also take compound-initial form, so it
takes its regular tones. In (946), the compound initial u$ro$- ‘house’ is based on
the tonal locative u@ro$ ‘in the house’, which occurs in the preceding sentence in
the text. The chained verb is su@mo@ ‘wash’.(946)   be@     ma$     su@mo@   u$ro$-nu@˘-w<o$           le$

but it does have some similarity to self-directed questions, cf. French comment
dirais-je?(794)   [ga@˘w E$mE$    ya^˘-Ø]                cE&˘   na$˘-y<,

        [[ferry Poss place Def] in] spend.night.Perf.L-1PlS
        ‘When we went to Gao, we spent the night at whatchamacallit?, we
        spent the night at the ferry place (=where the ferry crosses during the
        day).’ (French bac) 2004.5.1    In local French, chose is used in this way, and it has spawned verbs choser
and chosiner ‘do whatchamacallit?’.
    An overtly self-directed question ‘how do they say it?’ (yç&˘-ji $n ga@-ba$) may
also be used as a ‘whatchamacallit?’ phrase.
    There is no simple inflectable verb with the sense ‘do/be whatchamacallit?’.
The phrase ci $gE@ ka@r<a@-, literally ‘do (a) thing’ is used.
476     Focalization and interrogation
13.2.4 Embedded interrogativesIn this section I consider interrogative complements to main-clause verbs like
‘know’, as in ‘I don’t know (whether/who/what …)’.
    An embedded polar interrogative clause (‘whether or not …’) is a simple
quotative complement (§17.1), plus the usual clause-final interrogative particle
ma. The particle distinguishes an embedded interrogative (‘I didn’t know
whether …’) from a factive complement (‘I didn’t know that …’), although the
Jamsay embedded interrogative construction may be used (as complement of
‘know’) where English would use the factive complement. Examples are in
(795).(795)     a. [u@   yE$rE^˘     ma$]    jE@     u@ju@ro@-sa$-ba$

where English speakers would use a factive complement. This is the case in
(796.a), above, which would more naturally be expressed as ‘… who knows that
it was I …’ in a free English translation.
    Embedded WH interrogatives may be of two types. In one, the regular
WH-word is used, with optional clause-final interrogative particle ma. This
type approximates direct discourse, except for deictic substitutions such as
logophoric pronominals, where appropriate (797).(797)   a. jE$yE@-tu$-ba$      ta@Na$˘     de$y,

           [how.much? pay.Perf.L-3PlSQ]       know-ImpfNeg-1SgS
           ‘I don’t know how much they paid.’     This type, with the regular WH-word, is preferred for embedded ‘how
much?’ and for embedded ‘who?’. In the first case, this may be for lack of a
suitable nominal counterpart (‘amount’, ‘quantity’). In the second, the
preference may be due to avoidance of ambiguity between e.g. ‘I don’t know
who lives here’ (identificational knowledge) versus ‘I don’t know the person
who lives here’ (acquaintance).
     The second possibility for embedded WH interrogatives is the literal type
exemplified by “I don’t know the place in which he is” as the translation of
English ‘I don’t know where he is.’ That is, a generic noun like ‘place’, ‘time’,
‘manner’, or ‘thing’ is the head of a relative clause, which (as a syntactic NP)
functions as direct object of ‘know’ or other main-clause verb. There is no overt
interrogative element.

14 Relativization
14.1 Basics of relative clausesThe basic relative clause pattern has an internal head NP (marked by tone-
dropping), and a participle agreeing in gender-number features with this head
NP (rather than an inflected verb agreeing in all pronominal features with the
clause subject). Modifying adjectives and cardinal numerals remain with the
internal head NP, but some other NP-final elements (e.g. Definite ku$<, Plural
be@, universal and distributive quantifiers) follow the participle. The participle
itself therefore behaves somewhat like an adjective modifying the head noun in
several respects (recall that modifying adjectives also force tone-dropping on
the modified noun, and precede the NP-final elements mentioned above).
     It is also possible to expand this core relative clause structure (ending with a
participle and perhaps one or two NP-final morphemes) by adding a copy of the
head noun (not the full head NP), as a special kind of external head.
Specifically, this copied noun is “possessed” by the relative-clause proper,
which functions here as the possessor NP (and is therefore followed by
Possessive ma$). The complete construction may be suggested (crudely) by a
structural paraphrase, whereby ‘a/the dog that I saw’ is expanded as as ‘dog of
[a/the big dog that I saw]’, though of course the linear order in Jamsay is very
different (with the external ‘dog’ at the end). The copied external head noun is
optional, and occurs in fewer than half of relative clauses occurring in my texts,
but it is nonetheless quite well-attested.
     The internal head NP is occasionally omitted, whether or not the external
head is present. This results in an internally headless relative. However, in
such cases it is reasonable to think of a “light” head noun (such as ‘person’,
‘thing’, ‘place’, ‘time’, or ‘manner’) as being virtually present, though
phonologically inaudible. Furthermore, the participle agrees with this virtual
head: (human) Singular, (human) Plural, or Nonhuman. We can therefore think
of the agreement morpheme on the participle as a stand-in for a full head NP,
just as subject-pronominal suffixation on the verb of a main clause can function
as “subject NP.”
     Thus the maximal relative-clause construction might be described as
double-headed. However, the Jamsay construction (when examined in detail) is
rather unique, and I question how useful it would be to assign it to a general
“double-headed” typological category.
480     Relativization
     Within the relative-clause proper, the head NP remains in situ, i.e. it is not
systematically extracted to either the left or the right of (the rest of) the clause.
The head noun often happens to be clause-initial (disregarding topicalized
constituents), as is true of nonpronominal NPs in general, but it need not be so.
     Relative clauses in Jamsay are not used for parenthetical comments, as in
English nonrestrictive relatives of the type I like John, who (by the way) is in
Texas right now.
     Jamsay relatives may be definite or indefinite. If definite (‘the man whom I
saw’), they presuppose that the propositional content of the clause is true, and
known to the listener, often by virtue of preceding discourse. Since the content
is presupposed, there is a high propability that core NPs other than the
relativized NP itself will appear in pronominal form. Since pronominals (if not
topicalized or emphatic) occur in immediately preverbal position, this typically
results in clause-initial position for the (internal) head NP. Indefinite relatives
(‘a/any man who can climb this hill’) characterize an unidentified or generic
referent by the relevant proposition, which may include new nonpronominal
discourse referents, so in such relatives the head NP have no unusual
association with clause-initial position.
     Some notable features of Jamsay relatives, in addition to the use of
participles and the arrangement of (internal and external) heads as outlined
above, are the use of preverbal L-toned subject pronominals in non-subject
relatives with no nonpronominal subject NP, and the application of a H(H…)L
tone overlay to unsuffixed Perfective verbs (which generally replace suffixed
positive Perfective verb forms).
     Some important spatiotemporal and manner clauses are simply relative
clauses with a noun like ‘day’ or ‘place, manner’ as (overt or covert) head.","[497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502]"

3.5.4.2        Inter-Word u-ApocopeIn addition to these word-internal examples, there are frequent instances of
u-Apocope at word boundaries, when the following word is C-initial. These
instances of apocope have a syncope-like flavor, since the environment for
deletion is of the type vC_#Cv straddling the word boundary #. u-Apocope is
not obligatory in these cases. When it does occur, Stranded-Tone Re-Linking
may be necessary (often resulting in an R- or F-tone on the pre-apocope
64     Phonology
syllable, §3.7.4.5, below). Moreover, the specific flanking consonants play a
role. I will describe two basic subtypes, then discuss morphosyntactic restric-
tions on them.
     In one subtype, u at the end of a bisyllabic word is apocopated between
velar stops. In (68.a), the noun tç$gu@ ‘kind’ is followed by ka^˘< ‘each’. In
(68.b), sa$gu@ ‘entrusting (someone)’ is followed by ga@˘- ‘say’.(68)         full form      apocopated       gloss         a. tç$gu@ ka^˘<    tç&g ka^˘<       ‘each kind’ 2004.3.1
         b. sa$gu@ ga@˘-    sa&g ga@˘-       ‘say words of entrusting’ 2004.3.11     A common source of the relevant phonological environment is the com-
bination of a noun with following Definite ku$<. Example: to@gu$ ku$< ‘the (same)
shed’, often apocopated to to@g ku$<.
     This apocope does not occur in the final syllable of a trisyllabic noun:
yu$ru$gu@ ‘fox’, yu$ru$gu$ ka^˘< (not #yu$ru$g ka^˘<) ‘each fox’. This suggests that
metrical factors are at work (§3.2.2, above).
     Another construction favorable to u-Apocope between velars is the
predicate adjective construction with Nonhuman subject, e.g. [ADJkç$] ‘it is
ADJ’. Optional u-Apocope is observed with ç@gu$ ‘fast’ before velar stop, hence
ç@gkç$ ‘it is fast’ (phonetic [ç@k˘ç$]. Similarly, o$˘gu@ go@˘-yE$-m ‘I sweated’ (noun
o$˘gu@ ‘sweat’, go@˘-yE$-m ‘I went out’) is often apocopated to o&˘g go@˘-yE$-m.
     The sequence /gk/ produced by apocope in some of the examples above,
e.g. (68.a), is frequently pronounced kk (i.e. [k˘]).
     While the apocopated vowel is normally u, I have also recorded ju$g-go@-w
‘you-Sg do not know’ as a variant of ju$gç$-go@-w. The high-frequency
combination ju$gç@- ‘know’ and Imperfective Negative -go@- can also be idio-
syncratically contracted to jç$˘-go@-, so this verb is not a reliable guide to regular
phonology.
     Apocope of u between homorganic stops (or nasals) at a word boundary is
uncommon when the consonants are not velars. I have noticed no instances
involving labials. The noun bu@˘du$ ‘riyal (currency unit)’ tends to reduce to bu^˘d
before a numeral beginning with a stop or nasal (not necessarily homorganic).
These are high-frequency combinations, several of which can be considered to
be names of coins. Examples: bu^˘d nu&˘y< ‘five riyals’ and bu^˘d pE@ru@ ‘ten
riyals’. Apocope between palatoalveolars is uncommon, but I can cite gu&j-jE^m
‘black-skinned’ as a variant of gu$ju@-jE^m (a bahuvrihi compound), and
[cE$j-Ø]-[cE$j-u@] as a variant of [cE$j-u$]-[cE$j-u@] ‘for cutting’, a compound (used
as an adjective) consisting of an iterated VblN of cE@jE@- ‘cut’.
     The second major subtype is an inter-word counterpart to Post-Sonorant
Syncope (60), a process that applies word-internally as it was formulated above.
                                                3.5 Segmental phonological rules    65In the inter-word counterpart, a bisyllabic word loses its final u if this is
preceded by an unclustered r. Elsewhere r< patterns phonologically like r, but
this time it does not; informants rejected apocope of words ending in …r<u. For
example, contrast e$r<u@kç$ ‘it is plump’ with the very common e@rkç$ (from
e@ru$) ‘it is sweet’. Were …r<u to apocopate, it would be realised as …n by
Derhoticization (§3.5.5.1), as it is word-internally after Post-Sonorant Syncope
(60). Speakers seem to resist Derhoticization in inter-word cases.
      The most frequent cases of ...ru subject to apocope at a boundary are 2nd
and 3rd person dative pronominals ending in -ru@, when followed directly by a
verb. Apocope is most common when the verb begins with another coronal, but
I have several textual examples where the u is apocopated before a non-
homorganic consonant. 3Sg Dative wo$-ru@ becomes wo&-r before t in (69.a), a
very common result, but (69.b) shows that the same 3Sg Dative form
apocopates at least occasionally to wo&-r before g, and (69.c) shows a similar
apocope of yi $ru@ ‘garment, clothes’ before b.(69)    a. [bE$r-i^˘<    nE$]    wo&-r         ti@me@-sa$-Ø
           [goat-child now]      3Sg-Dat       resemble-Reslt-3SgS
           ‘A small goat resembles it (=scorpion).’ (wo$-ru@)        b. sE$llE$-lu@˘-Ø               wo&-r        ga@-w$
           be.healthy-PerfNeg-2SgS 3Sg-Dat say.Impf-2SgS
           ‘You-Sg will tell her that you’re sick.’ (wo$-ru@) 2004.3.3        c. ci@n    dç$ƒç&-m    yi&r   bE&t-tç@ƒç$-ba$
           thus    Dogon-Pl clothes get-Impf-3PlS
           ‘That [focus] is how Dogon people get clothes.’ (yi $ru@, bE$rE@-)
           2004.3.14    In (69.a), wo&-r is actually pronounced [wo&t] with r assimilated to the initial
t of the following word, though (for the sake of morphemic transparency) I
transcribe the pre-assimilation form.
    Apocope does not occur with trisyllabic stems. For example, I have never
observed apocope with do@gu@ru@ ‘time’, hence do$gu$ru$ ka^˘< (not #do$gu$r ka^˘<)
‘each time’.
    The two dative pronominals not ending in -ru@ are 1Sg mi&-n and 1Pl E$mE&-n.
These were probably once *mi $-ru@ and *E$mE$-ru@, or rather (with Nasalization-
Spreading) *mi $-r<u@ and *E$mE$-r<u@. If so, for these first person datives, the
original apocopated variants mi&-n and E$mE&-n, with n replacing the disallowed
syllable-final r< by Derhoticization (76), have now generalized.
    Adjectival predicates with Nonhuman subject (§11.4.a) provide additional
cases of apocope after the rhotic: ç$ru@ ‘fresh’ and predicative ç&rkç$ ‘it is fresh’;
66     Phonology
e@ru$ ‘sweet’ and predicative e@rkç$ ‘it is sweet’. Note that k is not homorganic to
r. The relationship of this type of u-Apocope to Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) is
brought out by the failure of long-voweled je@˘ru$ ‘bitter’ and of trisyllabic
o$nu$r<u@ ‘smooth, sleek’ to apocopate: je@˘ru@kç$ ‘it is bitter’, o$nu$r<u@kç$ ‘it is
smooth’. For the tones in e@rkç$ and je@˘ru@kç$ see Rightward H-Spreading
(§3.7.4.4).
      In compounds, the boundary between the initial and the final is usually
treated as a word boundary phonologically. Inter-Word u-Apocope (and Rhotic
Assimilation (77)) may become lexicalized in common combinations. An
example is bE$n-na@˘ ‘she-goat’, cf. bE$ru@ ‘goat’.
      Having described the two major subtypes of Inter-Word u-Apocope, I now
consider the morphosyntactic environments in which they regularly occur (70).
It should be noted that no inflected verb, or bare verb stem, ends in u (see
§3.4.4), so no combinations beginning with a verb are candidates for apocope.(70)     a.   compound

except in well-established compounds, Inter-Word u-Apocope is an optional
process; unapocopated variants are not shown here. The transcription is nearly
phonetic, but at true word boundaries I do not indicate the frequent assimilation
of word-final r to a following coronal, e.g. in yi&r te@˘re@- (71.b), which is usually

             bo@ru$ ‘(sb’s) uncle, ti@ri@wE$-n ‘grandchild’ [... bo@r] ti@ri@wE$-n    Regarding (71.d), complex numerals are compound-like sequences subject
to (morphophonological) lexicalization. In decimal terms (‘10’ to ‘90’), which
begin with pE@ru@- ‘ten’, apocope occurs in pE@t-ta$˘n ‘thirty’ but not in pE$ru$-su^y<
‘seventy’. What may be happening here is that numerical adjacency (as
reinforced by out-loud recitation) is the mother of phonological similarity. ‘70’
shares an aversion to apocope with the ’60, ‘80’, and ‘90’, while ‘30’ shares a
receptivity to apocope with ‘20’, ‘40’, and ‘50’. These two subseries of decimal
terms also differ in tones (§4.7.1.3).
    The strongest aversion to apocope is at the boundary between two NPs
(excluding the case where the first is an inalienable possessor). Apocope
between ‘uncle’ and ‘shed’ was therefore rejected in (72). Contrast this with
(71.h), above, where the same [mi $ bo@ru$] ‘my uncle’ does apocopate when it
functions as inalienable possessor, i.e. as a kind of loose compound initial.(72)    [mi $    bo@ru$]     to@gu$     to@go@-ti $-Ø

        ‘My paternal uncle built a shed.’
68     Phonology
    My assistant also rejected apocope between ‘one’ and ‘show’ in (73),
although some other cases of [word + verb] do apocopate, as indicated above.(73)     [u@ro@   tu@ru@]  te@˘re@-ti -$ Ø
         [house one]       show-Perf-3SgS
         ‘He/She showed one house.’    The problem here may be that tu@ru@ ‘one’ is bracketed with ‘house’. In the
other cases where a word apocopates directly before a word, it is a cognate
nominal, a simple noun, or a dative pronominal; all of these are liable to
function either like compound initials or like (pronominal) proclitics.
    My assistant also rejected apocope before discourse marker sa&y ‘only’, and
before sa$- ‘have’ (in the negative form sa$˘-ra@-, which can directly follow an
object noun). Therefore he did not accept apocope in (74), even in sentences
where the elements shown are presumably bracketed together.(74)     a. be$-ru@     sa&y

8.1     Tonal locatives8.1.1     Tonal locative of noun stemA small number of noun stems may be used, as locative adverbs, with an extra
L-tone component grafted onto the end, which results in a final F-toned
syllable or in a …HL contour on the final two syllables. There is no (other)
postposition. In spite of the final F or HL pattern, the tone contours here are
distinct from the exaggerated “dying quail” final intonation pattern (§3.8.3) that
is used with conjoined NPs and for words followed by fu@˘ ‘all’.
     The cases of tonal locative known to me, excluding similar forms confined
to greetings, are listed in (436). The inputs are of the following types: …HH
(436.a), monosyllabic Cv@˘ (436.b), …LH (436.c), monosyllabic Cv&˘ (436.d),
and nasal-final (436.e). There are no cases where a tonal locative is formed
from an (already) …HL or …F input noun, in which cases the tonal locative
would be indistinguishable from the input.(436)       noun           gloss              tonal locative gloss        a. bu@ro@          ‘pond’             bu@ro$          ‘in the pond’

of the input noun, which docks on the noun’s final syllable. The only similar
process is the addition of an L-tone at the end of verb stems to form the
unsuffixed Imperfective stem. In interlinears, the notation “…Loc.HL” will be
used. For the phonology in detail of these two formations, see Tone-Grafting
(§3.7.3.3).
    There is a shred of evidence to the effect that the tonal locative, at least in
specific cases, may still function morphosyntactically as a postposition. See
discussion following example (867), below.

           (=your own responsibility).’ 2004.5.1    Ordinarily, tonal locatives may only be formed from nouns, rather than
from modifiers such as adjectives or numerals. (For a rare exceptional case
where a modifying adjective takes tonal locative form, see §8.1.3, below.) The
noun must also be in NP-final position, i.e. not followed by an adjective,
numeral, or particle (including Definite ku$<), with a possible exception
discussed below.
    In a tonal locative, the noun may be preceded by a possessor NP and/or a
compound initial (438.a).(438)   a. E@mE@        dç$ƒç$-u@ro$
           1PlP         Dogon-house.Loc.HL

           [road          Dem]        in
           ‘on this road’     The noun u@ro@ ‘house’ and its tonal locative u@ro$ are ordinarily distin-
guishable. As compound initials, in the main noun-noun compound type with
tone-dropping on the initial, they would both merge as u$ro$-. In e.g.
[a$ƒa$-u$ro$]-ta&N-Ø ‘(bride’s) transfer to her husband’s home’, a compound
ending in a Verbal Noun, the associated VP is a$ƒa$-u@ro$ ta@Na@- ‘move to the
husband’s home’. One could argue, therefore, that the compound initial
[a$ƒa$-u$ro$]- is really a tonal locative whose basic ...HL tone contour has been
erased by an overlaid tone contour. Again, there is no way to demonstrate this
directly.
     The adverbial phrase nu$mo@ nu$mo@ ‘hand to hand’, cf. nu$mo@ ‘hand’, is
used with a verb like ‘give’, indicating that someone delivered something in
person to the recipient (not through an intermediary). For close combat, the
expression used is ‘chest to chest’, which has the same structure: gç$Nç@
286     Postpositions and adverbials
gç$Nç@ cf. gç$Nç@ ‘chest’. I take these to be conjunctions of iterated nouns (e.g.
‘hand and hand’), rather than as iterations of tonal locatives.
    In situational greetings associated with an activity or location (‘well’,
‘work’, ‘market’, etc.), the noun specifying the location in question has a tonal
form consistent with that in tonal locatives. See (1185) and comments there.
    Some postpositions are, or probably originated as, tonal locatives of nouns.
In (439), the HL contour converts a noun into a postposition, with a more
figurative sense than in the preceding cases. The complement takes the form of
a possessor. Textual examples are in (440).(439)         noun     gloss     postposition   gloss          a. ku@˘<     ‘head’    ku^˘<          ‘on the head of; about,

8.1.2     [ko@ X] with tonal locativeThe Nonhuman pronoun ko@ occurs in a construction [ko@ X] with a following
noun like ‘time’ or ‘place’. The resulting phrase may be translated ‘(at) that
time’, but ko@ here is structurally a possessor, hence ‘(at the) time of that’. The
construction should be distinguished from the demonstrative phrase [ko$ X] with
L-toned ko$ (§6.4.1).

H-tone in the penult, the final two syllables appear as an HL tone sequence. The
other attested example involves an R-toned monosyllable, so the output is bell-
shaped <LHL>. The tonal locative is applied somewhat inconsistently in these
examples, so variants with lexical tones also occur. The data are in (441), the
clear cases with audible differences being (441.a-b). In (441.c), the noun al-
ready has lexical HHL tones, so there is no audible change in the tonal locative.(441)        noun        gloss      with ko@          gloss        a. do@gu@ro@     ‘time’ ko@ do@gu@ru$         ‘(at) that time’

8.3.2     Simple and complex PPsA simple PP is of the form [X Postp], where the postposition is added directly to
the complement NP (cf. English in, at). A complex PP is of the form [X ma$
Postp], where Possessive ma$ intervenes. The postpositions used in the complex
type have a (syntactic) possessor as complement (cf. English in front of, ahead
of). Such postpositions probably all originated as nouns in tonal locative form.
The original construction was therefore of the type *[[X’s N]-Loc] (e.g. ‘on X’s
head’), where X was the possessor of the noun N, rather than the (direct)
complement of the locative marker.
     In spite of this historical origin, there remains the question whether
complex PPs in modern Jamsay are still syntactically analysable as [[X’s N]-
Loc] with an embedded possessor, or have been reanalysed so that
[X ma$ Postp] with a purely formal Possessive morpheme now behaves like
simple [X Postp]. It is possible to test this by observing relativization patterns.
When a simple PP is relativized on, both the postposition and the final word of
the complement NP undergo tone-dropping (§14.6.1). When a complex PP of
the type [X ma$ Postp] is relativized on, two patterns are observed: a) both the
postposition and (the last word of) the complement NP are tone-dropped; b)
only (the last word of) the complement NP is tone-dropped (§14.6.2).

8.3.3     ‘in’ (bE@rE$$ and bE$rE^˘)An explicitly locative postposition, specifying that the focal object is enclosed
within the boundaries of the landmark object, takes either of the forms in (450).
Both bE@rE$, which requires a non-pronominal NP complement, and bE$rE^˘, which
can take either a pronoun or an NP as complement, are related to the noun bE$rE@

alienably possessed noun. Its complement is a possessor in form: noun-headed
NP plus Possessive ma$, or a pronominal possessor. By comparing it to the noun
bE$rE@ ‘belly’, we see that it has an incremental final F-tone (as in tonal
locatives), preserving the lexical L-tone of the first syllable.(451)     a. ko@           bE$rE^˘

             2003.3.1     By contrast, bE@rE$ is used only with noun-headed (i.e. nonpronominal)
complements. With its HL tone, it may be compared to the stem-level H(H…)L
overlay on tonal locatives of nouns, e.g. u@ro$ ‘at the house, (at) home’ (§8.1,
above). However, it is also similar to the compound type [x# n^] (§5.1.5), and to
inalienably possessed nouns (§6.2.2).

        ‘if a wild animal had fallen on (=attacked) you-Pl’   However, even in this case the specific body part ‘head’ is not central, and a
more general gloss ‘on’ or ‘onto’ is appropriate. An adversarial (or malefactive)
nuance is apparent here, as it is in the following (454).(454)   [a&-n     ma$         ku^˘<]  ya&˘-yE$-ba$  ta@Na$˘  de$y, …

        2004.3.3    The postposition is common in the abstract sense ‘about, concerning’, with
a verb of speech or thought.

     ma@na$ is added directly to a noun, without possessor marking. However.

locational PP itself does not specify directionality of movement, but is
compatible with directionality expressed by a motion verb (see beginning of this
chapter).
    (456.c), from a tale, involved Camel towering over Hyena’s shed, grazing
on tree foliage overhead at night. Not understanding this, Hyena had just asked
whether Camel was lying down to sleep all night on the shed.
    ma@na$ can be used with reference to a vertical rather than horizontal
position, e.g. ‘on the wall’, when the context is otherwise suggestive of hori-
zontal position (a surface supporting the landmark object).(457)   [go@wo@    ma@na$]      ya&˘-ra$-Ø

spatial and manner adverbials (§15.2.5, §15.2.6.1). The complement is in

(460.a). In addition, ji@re@ le@ ‘in front’, which can also be an adverbial without
overt complement (as in ‘they are walking in front’), can take a possessor
complement (460.b). There is also a combination ji $re$-da@gu@ le@ with H-toned

        [1PlP      before]      come.Perf.L-3PlS
        ‘They came here before us.’     However, there is a clausal ‘before …’ construction with “pseudocausative”
nominal (suffix -wv$) and particle le@ (§15.2.4.2) added to the verb ‘arrive’, and
this construction is used when an explicit temporal reference point is involved.(462)   [[ma@ bu@˘du$] ma$ bE$r-u@]           de$ne@-m$

        ‘I want my money before the market (day) (arrives).’    When the reference point is a dwelling, instead of ji@re$ or variant, we get a
locative form (final …HL tone realized as F-tone) of the compound mç$˘-ka@˘
‘door’ (including ka@˘ ‘mouth’), namely mç$˘-ka^˘. Thus ‘in front of the house’ is
expressed as ‘at the door of the house’ (463.a). Likewise, ka^˘ ‘at the mouth’
(tonal locative of ka@˘ ‘mouth’) is used in contexts like ‘in front of (= at the
mouth of) the cave’ (463.b).(463)   a. [u@ro@    ma$    mç$˘-ka^˘]             nu$mo$-Ø$

8.3.8   ‘behind’ (gu&n le@), ‘after’ (gu&nn$)gu&n may have the spatial sense ‘behind’, where the reference position is defined
by a person, object, or place. In this sense, gu&n most often occurs with
following le@ in locative function. The complement of ‘behind’ is expressed as a
possessor, hence requires ma$ after a nonpronominal NP (464.a-b).(464)   a. [u@ro@  ma$ gu&n       le@] ji $-ni^˘ ni $˘-Ø

connection with a reference time. The complement is again expressed as a
possessor. Expressions with human complement like ‘after us’ are understood
as meaning ‘after our departure’ and the like. As a postposition without le@,
gu&nn$ is in tonal locative form.(465)     a. [E@mE@   gu&nn$]     ni $-di^˘<   yE&s-sa$-ba$

             2004.5.3     gu&nn$ without le@ may also be used in what appears to be spatial rather than
temporal sense with the verb di g $ E@- ‘follow’; see (914) in §15.2.1.2. However,
the difference between spatial and temporal is not sharp with ‘follow’ (compare
the rough equivalence in English between follow behind and follow after).
8.3.9     ‘on the side of’ (a$rga@ le@)This expression means ‘on the side of (sb, sth)’, or more broadly ‘in the vicinity
of’. It can be used with human referent to mean ‘in the presence of’, or even ‘at
the home of, chez’. The complement takes possessor form.(466)     a. [ma@    a$rga@     le@]   yE@re@

8.3.10 ‘under’ (do@ju$$)This postposition most often takes a simple non-possessor NP without Poss-
essive ma$ as complement. However, ma$ is optionally added (467.d). Moreover,
if the complement is pronominal, it must have pronominal possessor form. In
form, do@ju$ is compatible with a tonal locative of the noun do@ju@ ‘bottom’.(467)   a. tu$mo@ [u@ro@     do@ju$]    yç@ku$n-Ø

where ‘under you’ means ‘hidden on your body’ (i.e. in an inside pocket).","[313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321]"

17.6.4 ‘So that …’ or ‘had better’ (v# + -m)There is a purposive construction of the type (1088). Here the purposive (‘so
that …’) clause follows the main clause, or at least does so often. This sets this
construction apart from other subordinated clauses, which precede (or are
embedded in) the main clause.(1088) [main clause]     [… v# + -m]     For examples see (1091-3) later in this section. The notation [v# + -m]
means that the verb has its lexical tones (though an R-toned monosyllable may
be heard as L-toned), and is followed by an atonal suffix -m that acquires its
surface tone from the preceding morpheme. The tonal pattern distinguishes the
current construction from the Hortative, which has an H-toned -m@ suffix after a
tone-dropped all-L stem, i.e. [v$ + -m@] (§10.4.3).
     A pronominal subject is expressed with a clause-initial independent
pronoun, arguably a presentential topic.
     The sense ‘had better’ or ‘must’ is expressed by combining [… v# + -m]
with ti@la^yy$ ‘it is an obligation’ (< noun ti@la^y). We see this in the extended
passage (1089). The verb tE@mE@- ‘find’ has its lexical HH tones before -m, hence
tE@mE@-m. The HH tone contour makes it clear that this is not a plural participle
(cf. Perfective tE@mE$-m, Imperfective tE@mE@-m$), and that it is not a 1Sg subject
form (Perfective tE$mE$-m, Imperfective tE@mE@-m$).

          better find gunpowder.’ (bu@gu$) 2004.3.24      This text is about a ritual where the young men of the village assembled in
the bush, under the watchful gaze of their elders, to demonstrate that they were
properly armed for fighting (or for taking on wild animals). The force of the
repeated tE@mE@-m is captured by ‘they had better find …’, where ‘they’ (not
expressed overtly) is generic.
      Follow-up elicitation produced examples (1090), where the subject (agent)
of ‘find’ is expressed as an independent pronoun (perhaps topicalized) at the
left.

context as in the preceding examples, but the clause with ce@je@-m ‘meet’ is not
attached to another preceding clause (imperative or otherwise). I suggest it is
truncated from something like ‘…the place that you-Sg have told him to go in

competes with other ‘why?’ interrogatives (§13.2.2.2). /ko@ so@go$/ or more often

This chapter covers the morphosyntax of antecedent-anaphor relationships:
reflexive, topic-indexing, logophoric, and reciprocal.
      The forms i $ni w
                      $ <e@ (e.g. reflexive object) and E$nE@ (e.g. reflexive possessor,
logophoric) may be related to each other and to the noun i@ne@- ‘person’ (e.g. Sg
i@ne@-n). E$nE@ has a dialectal variant i n$ e@-. Both i n $ i $w<e@ and E$nE@ are morpho-
logically nouns rather than pronouns. They may be followed by regular
nominal postpositions, but do not have special dative clitic forms like those of
true personal pronouns, E$nE@ (but not i n      $ i $w<e@) may be pluralized by adding
particle be@.","[656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664]"
"
18.2.2 Non-logophoric topic-indexing function (E$nE@, E$nE@ be@)Once a discourse referent is established as a topical NP, a co-indexed Reflexive
pronoun (Sg E$nE@, Pl E$nE@ be@) may occur as subject of a following adverbial
clause or non-subject relative clause, or as possessor of the complement of an
adverbial PP that serves as background for a subsequent main clause. The term
“Reflexive” is not quite right for this indexing function, but for lack of a better
label I will use “Refl” in interlinears.
    The adverbial PP type is illustrated in (1122). Such an adverbial phrase is
semantically equivalent to a background clause (e.g. ‘when it is young’).(1122) n)u$˘-to&y     [[E$nE@ ma$     da@ƒa@]        le$], …
       millet.L-seed [[Refl Poss young.stage] in], …
       ‘a millet seedlingx [topic], in itsx early stage of development, …’
       2004.3.8    The adverbial-clause type is shown in (1123), with Reflexive pronominals
in subject function. (1123.b) also has an a second E$nE@ as Reflexive possessor
function, which is not directly relevant here. Another example is (214.a).(1123) b. ki -$ ka@˘         [wa$ka$ti $ [ko@      bE$rE^˘]  E$nE@

text is about a class of griots (a caste of bards) rather than about an individual.
The speaker’s slip is easily understood, since the initial i n           $ e$ ‘person’ is
unmarked for number, as often with relative heads. The embedded relative
clause ‘whomever they follow’ is headless; the full form would have another

 $ e$ ‘person.L’ as head within the brackets: i $ne$ [i n

      The use of E$nE@ in this indexing function does not apply to non-subject
functions within clauses. For these non-subject functions, E$nE@ may only have

to “slip into” the E$nE@ form in a dative (referring to the generic child that has

E$nE@ le$. The speaker then interrupts himself, and repeats the phrase with the

18.3 Reciprocal18.3.1 Simple reciprocals (tç^˘-n, tç^˘-m)Reciprocal is expressed by the noun tç^˘-n (Singular) or tç^˘-m (Plural). The
Singular form is required when there are just two entities involved. When three
or more are involved, either the Singular or the Plural may be used. To the
extent that the Pl form is used when a minimum of three entities (e.g. speaker
and two other persons) is involved, the choice of grammatical number is based
on the perspective of one of the participants (‘me and the other one’ versus
‘me and the other ones’).
     These Reciprocal pronouns are related to a noun meaning ‘comrade,
colleague’, which has the forms in (1129). Human suffixes occur only in the
presence of an overt possessor, as with some inalienable kin terms (§6.2.2). The
possessed forms may be treated as alienable, e.g. ma@ tç@w<ç@-n ‘my comrade’, or
inalienable, e.g. mi $ tç^˘-n ‘my comrade’ (§6.2.1-2). The F-tone in tç^˘-n is
compatible with the overlaid H(H…)L tone of inalienably possessed kin terms.(1129) unpossessed                   possessed Sg possessed Pl        tç@w<ç@

in verbal inflection, the 3Sg subject suffix -Ø agrees with human or nonhuman
referents. The exception is that in the (positive) unsuffixed Imperfective,
nonhuman subject is expressed by adding cliticized kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’ to the
verb stem (§10.1.2.8, §10.2.2).
     The independent form, arguably basic morphologically, is used
independently, for direct object (always preverbal), complement of postposition
(other than dative), and possessor of ordinary (alienable) noun. All independent
pronominals are high-toned.
     Subject category is expressed either by an inflectional suffix (the [Verb-_ ]
column) or by a preverbal pronoun (the [ _Verb] column). With rare
exceptions (§10.2.2), the two do not co-occur. The preverbal pronoun occurs in
relatives and some other subordinated clauses. The suffixed pronominal occurs
in ordinary main clauses, except that subject-focus constructions (which have a
focused subject pronoun or noun, usually at the beginning of the clause) have no
suffix.
     The (unfocalized) preverbal subject forms in (191) are segmentally identical
to independents, except that the tone is dropped to L. The preverbal subject
pronominals are therefore identical to the prenominal inalienable possessor
pronominals (rightmost column). The pronominal-subject suffixes are at best
loosely related to any of the other pronominal series. Note in particular that the
nonsuffixal 3Pl forms are all be@ (or L-toned be$) versus 2Pl e@ (or e$), but in the
pronominal-subject suffixes -be is 2Pl, while 3Pl is expressed as -ba (reducing
to -e or -a after a Negative suffix). For more on the subject suffixes, see §10.2.
                                                                4.3 Pronouns    157      The dative has its own special series of pronominal forms in -n (1Sg and
1Pl, with rising tone) or -ru@ (2nd/3rd person), bearing no obvious
morphological relationship to the regular Dative postposition le$ used after
noun-headed NPs. The forms ending in -ru@ often undergo Post-Sonorant
Syncope (60) before a coronal consonant, deleting the u vowel, e.g. 3Pl Dative
be$-ru@ ‘for them’ becoming /be&-r/ (with R-tone). The r then assimilates to the
coronal, hence be&-t ti@me@-sa$ ‘it resembled them’, see Rhotic Assimilation (77).
1Sg mi&-n and 1Pl E$mE&-n may derive historically (by apocope) from *mi $-r<u@
and *E$mE$-r<u@, see §3.5.4.
      Possessor pronominals are in two series. Some kin terms take a special
inalienable possessor series that is identical in form to the L-toned preverbal
subject series; the noun itself shows a {HL} tone overlay. Example: mi $ de^˘ ‘my
father’. Other nouns take H-toned alienable possessor pronouns (and no tone
overlay). The alienable possessor series are identical to independent pronouns,
except that there are special alienable possessor forms for 1Sg (ma@) and 2Sg
(a@). For more on possessive constructions, including tonal overlays, see §4.2.
      There are other syntactic contexts that induce stem-wide tone-dropping
(noun before modifying adjective, noun as head of a relative clause, verb stem
before Negative suffix). One could therefore take the preverbal subject and
inalienable-possessor forms as grammatically identical to independent pro-
nouns, but subject to a morpho-phonological rule dropping H-tones to all-L
tones on preverbal subject and inalienable possessor pronominals.","[177, 178, 179]"

6.8     Universal and distributive quantifiers6.8.1    ‘Each X’ (ka^˘<) and ‘all X’ (cE^w, fu@˘, so@y)Three forms are relevant here. Distributive quantifier ka^˘< behaves like an
adjective (or compound final), forcing tone-dropping on a preceding noun. It is
best glossed ‘each, every’, and occurs most often in simple NP’s consisting just
of [noun (+ adjective) + ka^˘<]. It does not co-occur with determiners
(demonstratives, Definite) or with other quantifiers such as cardinal numerals. It
must be distinguished from homonym ka^˘< ‘also, too’ (variant ka@r<a$), which
occurs freely after a wide range of NPs (and other constituents) and has no tonal
effect on the preceding word (§19.1.3).
      Universal quantifiers cE^w and fu@˘ (the latter also pronounced pu@˘ after a
nasal) are more emphatic, may be glossed in context as ‘all’ or less often ‘each,
every’, and occur at the end of the constituent they have scope over. cE^w and
fu@˘ do not force tone-dropping on a preceding nonpronominal NP. However, fu@˘
does induce the dying-quail final intonation (symbol ), i.e. prolongation and
exaggerated falling tone, on the preceding word when it modifies a
nonpronominal NP (§3.8.3): u$r<o@ fu@˘ ‘every hole’, roughly phonetic [u$r<o@o#o$
fu@˘]. The  effect is usually omitted, but occasionally audible, in pronominal
combinations, e.g. [ko$() fu@˘] ‘all of it, everything’.
      Both cE^w and fu@˘ force L-tone on a preceding pronominal (but not noun):
E$mE$ cE^w or E$mE$ fu@˘ ‘all of us’. ‘Everything’ is expressed by [ko$ ce^w] or [ko$
fu@˘], where ko$ can be taken as the tone-dropped counterpart of Nonhuman
pronoun ko@, or (less likely) as the prenominal demonstrative ko$. 1Pl E@mE@ is
often apocopated before fu@˘, with the f then hardening to p after the nasal: E$m
pu@˘ ‘all of us’. fu@˘ is sometimes itself prolonged intonationally: fu@˘. An
elicited example is (381), where fu@˘ shifts to pu@˘ after a nasal. I have difficulty
in text transcriptions determining when the intonational marking  is justified
for fu@˘, since universal quantifiers are naturally emphatic.(381)    u@r<-u$m pu@˘             ya&˘-ya$-ba$

    My assistant did not accept sentences where a “floating” cE^w or fu@˘ (in

          ‘The money, I gave him [all of it].’      i@ne@ ‘person’ requires a suffix (Sg -n, Pl -m) when unmodified, and
specifically requires Pl -m before cE^w and fu@˘, hence i@ne@-m cE^w and i@ne@-m
fu@˘ ‘all people, everyone’. By contrast, this stem appears as i n
                                                                 $ e$ without suffix
(and with tones dropped) before ka^˘< ‘each’, hence i $ne$ ka^˘< ‘each person’. A
possibly related quirk is that i n $ e$ ka^˘< is sometimes applied to nonhuman
entities in the sense ‘each one’ (383).(383)     ya$˘-gç$˘-na@˘            [ko@  lE$y] tu$l-la@-Ø,

in dç$ƒç$-n ka^˘< ‘each Dogon’ and n)E$-n ka^˘< ‘each woman’.
    (384) shows that all three quantifiers can be used at least loosely in
distributive sense. The version with ka^˘< (384.a) is clearly predominant in this
context (if the noun has no other modifiers). However, if special emphasis is
placed on the fact that every single person was given a sheep, a singular
countable noun may be followed by cE^w or by fu@˘.(384)     a. [i $ne$    ka^˘<   le$] [pe@˘ju@ tu@t-tu@ru@]     o$˘-ba$

here, stressing that the predication applies to every one of the elements in the set

be made by observing the linear order of elements in the elicited examples
(388.a-b).

4.7.1.1    ‘One’, ‘same (one)’, and ‘other’The numeral ‘1’ is tu@ru@. This form is used in counting, and as a postnominal
modifier to denote a single unit (in an unmarked context, as in answering a
‘how many?’ question): u@ro@ tu@ru@ ‘one house’. Unlike other numerals, which do
not take -n and -m suffixes, tu@ru@ often takes (human) Sg suffix -n when
modifying a human noun: dç$ƒç&-n tu@ru@-n ‘one Dogon’. tu@ru@ is also used in the
iterated distributive tu@t-tu@ru@ (syncopated from /tu@ru@-tu@ru@/) ‘one by one, one at
a time’ (§4.7.1.6, below).
     In the form tu@ru@, this numeral behaves like other numerals in requiring that
a preceding modified noun show its lexical tones. However, for paired body
parts (‘hand’, ‘foot’, ‘eye’, etc.), there is an alternative construction with
HL-toned tu@ru$ and all-L tone for the noun, as for nouns preceding ordinary
adjectives: E$nE@ ma$ nu$mo$ tu@ru$ ‘one of his hands (nu$mo@).
     tu@ru@ is not generally also used in the fashion of French un(e) and English
a(n) or some as an indefinite article, e.g. to introduce a new discourse referent.
Likewise, informants rejected plural #tu@ru@-m ‘ones’, with or without a
preceding plural noun.
     Another form, perhaps historically related to tu@ru@ in some way, is the
adjective tu@mno@, which can be glossed (in context) with preceding noun X as
‘(a) single X’, ‘(only) one X’, or ‘the same X’. Here the pragmatic nuance is
more emphatic, denying the possibility that a second X is relevant, or that the
original X has been replaced by another X.
     The adjective ‘other’ is la$ƒa@. It can be used either in the sense of
‘additional’ (as in ‘I already own one house, and want to buy another’), or in the
sense ‘alternative’ (as in ‘I don’t like my current house, I’m going to sell it and
buy another one’). As a pragmatic sentence-adverb with no modified noun, la$ƒa@
is common in the sense ‘furthermore’ or ‘in addition’.
     When a pair of entities or other nonsingular set has already been introduced
as a discourse referent, contrastive sequences of the type ‘one went, the other
(one) stayed here’ can be expressed by repeating the numeral ‘one’ in a
parallelistic construction (236).(236)     i@ne@-m     lE$y,   [ko@   n)a‡˘     ku$<] …

drops to L-tone in normal speech when the numeral is NP-final and follows a
noun or other head (238.b). The R-tone is still heard in careful pronunciation in
elicited examples. The modified noun preceding the numeral has its regular
tones; there is no tone-dropping before a cardinal numeral. If Definite ku$< is
added, the R-tone is generally audible even in modifying function (238.c).(238)     a. lE&y               E@˘-sa$-m

suggests a syntactically appositional structure (§6.9). Further support for this
comes from the fact that when a [noun + numeral] combination is head of a
relative clause, the noun and the numeral undergo tone-dropping in parallel
(§14.1.3).","[205, 206, 207]"

17.4 Verbal Noun (and other nominal) complementsThe Verbal Noun has suffix -y@ after a monosyllabic stem, elsewhere -u@. The u@
is lost under some conditions, by Suffixal u-Apocope (67) after a sonorant
(§3.5.4.1). A Verbal Noun may be formed from any regular verb, but not from
defective quasi-verbs like wç$- and kç$ ‘be’, or sa$- ‘have’, nor from stative
stance verbs confined to inflected perfective forms such as da$˘<- ‘sit’. Verbal
Nouns are formed directly from uninflected verb stems, one consequence of
which is that there are no negative Verbal Nouns.
     A Verbal Noun (or other nominal denoting an action), can be used in a
complement clause, as the following sections will demonstrate. The Verbal
Noun may be accompanied by a full range of internal arguments, so we should
really speak of a Verbal Noun clause.
     Verbal Noun phrases may also function as regular arguments of verbs. In
(1041), the Verbal Noun phrase is the subject of ‘arrive’.(1041) [[e$ju@  le@] wo@    go$-y@]          dç@˘-ya$-Ø       de$y, …

612   Complement and purposive clauses
17.4.1 Structure of Verbal Noun PhraseThe structure of a Verbal Noun Phrase may be summarized as in (1042).(1042) a. the verb is nominalized as a Verbal Noun;
       b. an immediately preceding chained verb appears as an L-toned
              compound initial;
       c. an unmodified object noun usually appears as an L-toned
              compound initial:
          —very common with cognate nominal or generic object (§11.1.6);
          —possible for a a wider variety of object NPs when preceded by a
              subject NP (in possessor form)
       d. other NPs and adverbials typically appear in possessor form
          —the inner possessor (adjacent to VblN) has normal alienable
              possessor form
          —an outer possessor (not adjacent to VblN), even an independent
              pronoun, has a following Possessive ma$    Overall, the structure of a Verbal Noun phrase, especially the treatment of
preceding constituents, is similar to that of ‘before …’ clauses, which have a
nominalized verb that I call pseudo-causative (§9.3, §15.2.4.2). The main
syntactic difference is that Verbal Nouns are more prone to object-compounding
than are pseudo-causative nominals.
    The word-level morphology of Verbal Nouns is described in §4.2.2.
    Examples showing how a chained verb immediately preceding the VblN
appears as an L-toned compound initial are (1043.a-b). (1043.c) shows that a
chained verb retains its normal form when something else (here an object noun
as compound initial) intervenes.(1043) a. [ki $-ka@˘           ma$         pi $li $we$-yE$r-u@]

                            17.4 Verbal Noun (and other nominal) complements 613
    In the absence of an overt subject in possessor form, a non-generic object
NP may appear as a possessor of the VblN, unless separated from the nominal
by an intervening element such as a dative pronominal. Possessor status is
standard when the object is pronominal, or an NP that does not lend itself to
being a compound initial (e.g. a plural noun, a multi-word NP, or a personal
name). The possessive structure is seen clearly in (1044.a), where ma@ is unam-
biguously a 1Sg possessor pronominal (contrast 1Sg independent pronoun or
object mi@ and 1Sg preverbal subject mi $). (1044.b) has Nonh ko@ in the same
construction. (1044.c) has a plural NP (‘women’) as logical object, expressed as
a possessor with Possessive ma$.(1044) a. ma@       cE$r-u@

           ‘hitting women’    If the object NP consists of a simple noun stem with no following modifier,
especially with generic reference, or if it is an unmodified cognate nominal, it
quite often takes compound-initial form, which requires stem-wide tone-
dropping (to all-L tone). (1045.a) is based on bi@rE@ bi $rE@- ‘work a work’ (i.e. ‘do
work’). a sequence of cognate nominal and inflectable verb. In (1045.a), the
cognate nominal appears as an L-toned compound initial bi $rE$-. With ‘cooking
meat’ and the like, where the object is a “real” noun, we can get either a
compound (1045.b) or a possessive construction (1045.c). (1045.d) is another
example of the compound structure.(1045) a. bi r$ E$-bi $r-u@

           ‘sheep-slaughtering’    A possessor does not necessarily prevent the noun from appearing as
L-toned compound initial, as long as the noun’s referent is generic (1046). One
could argue that the (surface) morphosyntax in such examples is of the type
‘hole-digging of ditches’ and ‘debris-sweeping of date palms’, though in main
clauses ‘ditches’ and ‘date palms’ would be possessors of ‘hole’ and ‘debris’,
respectively.(1046) [pç$<se@     ma$]         u$r<o$-ja$-y@<,          …,

       …’ (u$r<o@, ja&˘<, bç$rç$-ka@˘. French fossé) 2004.5.3     As shown below, when both the subject (as possessor) and the object are
overtly expressed in a Verbal Noun clause, an unusually wide variety of object
NPs are forced into compound initial status.
     The subject of the lower verb is often coindexed with the main-clause
subject, and in this case it is not repeated in the lower clause. However, a
subject may appear in a Verbal Noun clause in certain contexts. With
intransitives (i.e. in the absence of a co-occurring object NP), the subject is
expressed as a possessor (1047).(1047) a. n)E&-m     ma$     a$na$-ye@y

           ‘my sleeping’ (variant as compound: ma@ ji $ni $˘-ni $-y@<)    In transitives with both an object and a subject expressed, the subject
normally appears as an outer possessor, followed by Possessive ma$ (even after
an independent pronominal). The construction is easy to elicit, and occurs
                           17.4 Verbal Noun (and other nominal) complements 615
occasionally in texts, provided that at least one of the two arguments is
pronominal. ‘Cat’ in (1048.a) is followed by Possessive ma$, as are the pronouns
1Pl E@mE@ and 2Sg u@ in (1048.b-c). The 2Sg example (1048.c) demonstrates that
the pronominal preceding ma$ is in independent pronoun (rather than
possessor) form, since 2Sg independent H-toned u@ is distinct both from
alienable possessor a@ and from L-toned inalienable possessor u$. (1048.c) also
shows that the logical object E$n)E@ ‘chicken’ appears in normal main-clause form
with lexical tones (rather than as possessor or L-toned compound initial) when it
is separated from the VblN by an intervening element (here a dative
pronominal).(1048) a. ni -$ ni w

[NP ma$ [NP ma$ VblN]], is what we would expect based on the preceding
examples. It is in fact elicitable (1049), but in practice speakers avoid it.(1049) [a$r<-u@m ma$ n)E-& m      ma$ la$g-u@]     ha@dE@-ba$
       [man-Pl Poss woman-Pl Poss hit-VblN] prevent.Impf-3PlS
       ‘They will prevent men from hitting women.’     Instead, speakers generally express the logical object as an L-toned
compound initial rather than as a possessor, resulting in [NP ma$ noun.L-VblN]
with just one morphologically overt possessor (in normal alienable possessor
form), as in (1050.a-c). Some of the normal restrictions on nominal compound
initials (generic reference, no separate pluralization, no separate possessor) are
616   Complement and purposive clauses
relaxed to allow generous use of the compound construction. Thus (1050.a) is
preferred to (1049), above, although it allows the compound initial to keep its
Plural suffix -m. Likewise (1050.b), with unmodified ‘millet’ that can be
construed as generic, may be expanded as (1050.c), where ‘my’ is logically the
possessor of the millet, hence ‘(the) eating (of) [my millet]’. This forces a non-
generic reading of ‘millet’, but it still appears in compound-initial form; the
surface morphosyntax is, apparently, ‘my [millet-eating]’, though not in the
sense this would have in English.
     However, my assistant did balk at using the compound construction when
postnominal modifiers (numerals, demonstratives) forced nongeneric readings.
So (1050.d) was unproblematic (the modifying adjective permits a generic
reading), but (1050.e) reverts to the full construction where the object (as well
as the subject) appears as a possessor.(1050) a. [a$r<-u@m ma$] [n)E-$ m]-la$g-u@          ha@dE@-ba$

     In subject-object-VblN sequences, expressing the object as a compound
initial seems to be regular even when it is a toponym or a personal name, as in
(1051). Such flagrantly non-generic nouns are elsewhere disallowed as initials
in noun-noun or noun-agentive compounds. This is further evidence of the
lengths to which speakers will go to avoid the recursive-possessor construction
in Verbal Noun clauses.(1051) a. [ma@     ba$ma$ko$-ye@y]
          [1SgP    Bamako.L-going]
          ‘my going to Bamako.’        d. [a@˘ma@du$ ma$     fa$˘tu$ma$-jE$-y@]
           [Amadou    Poss Fatouma.L-marry-VblN]
           ‘Amadou’s marrying Fatouma’     The strategy of expressing the object as L-toned compound initial,
regardless of generic or specific reference, makes this construction resemble
syntactic tone-dropping in relative-clause subjects, rather than ordinary com-
pounding. Verbal Noun clauses contrast with the other productive nominalized
clause, the ‘before …’ clause with pseudo-causative nominal, which seems to
have no problem with recursive possessors.
     A PP or other adverbial may appear in a Verbal Noun clause with
following Possessive ma$. (1052) is from a text describing the many activities of
members of the blacksmith caste. We get a sequence [[X ma$] [[[Y le$] ma$]
VblN]], where X is a cognate object and Y is dative or allative with postposition
le$.(1052) [ya$˘ji@˘    ma$     o$ju$-ka@˘ ma$     i $jE@]

17.4.2 ‘Prevent’ (ha@dE@-, ga$˘na@-)ga$˘na@- and Fulfulde loanword ha@dE$- can be used in the sense ‘obstruct, prevent
(sb, from doing sth)’. The subject of the lower verb appears as main-clause
direct object (1053.a), or as possessor of the Verbal Noun (1053.b).

     When the subjects of the two clauses are not coindexed, as in (1054.b-d), it
is also possible to have a complement clause with an imperfective verb, rather
than a Verbal Noun. See (1142-3) in §18.4.4, below.","[633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641]"

            $ i $w<e@ is an anaphor that is coindexed with the clause-mate subject.
It may function as a direct object or postpositional complement. Further detail
on the syntax is given in §18.4, below.
    Reflexive object is expressed by the invariant noun i n $ i $w<e@, which does not
agree with the subject in person, humanness, or plurality (1104).(1104) a. i $ni $w<e@   la@ƒa@-sa$-m

            ‘They hit-Past themselves.’    A following verb may also occur in the unmarked Perfective. This
defocalization of the verb suggests that the Reflexive pronoun is (covertly)
focalized. Therefore (1105.a), below, is available as an alternative to (1104.a),
above. (1105.b) shows that overt focalization with y$ clitic is also possible.

18.1.2 Reflexive possessor (Sg E$nE@, Pl E$nE@ be@)18.1.2.1 Ordinary contexts (not coordinated)In third-person possessor function, we get the noun E$nE@ for Singular Reflexive,
and E$nE@ be@ (with nominal Plural particle be@) for Plural Reflexive. Again, the
antecedent is the clause-mate subject. E$nE@ and Pl E$nE@ be@ are also used in
logophoric function (§18.2.1, below).
     First and second persons have no special Reflexive possessor forms. The
regular possessor forms for those categories are used regardless of any
coindexing to a clause-mate subject.
     Singular Reflexive E$nE@ is followed by Possessive postposition ma$ in cases
of ordinary (alienable) possession. (1108.a) shows 3Sg possessor with a subject
that it is not coindexed to. This contrasts with the reflexive possessor con-
struction in (1108.b). (1108.c) shows that 1st/2nd person subjects co-occur with
ordinary possessor pronominals of the same category, rather than taking special
reflexive possessor forms. (1108.d) shows that a non-subject NP (here the direct
object) may not serve as the antecedent of a reflexive possessor (‘his field’).(1108) a. [wo@          i $ju@]   wç&˘-tu$-m

that can be thought of “possessing” something, and occasionally even inan-
imates with reference to their parts.(1109) a. i $ju@   [E$nE@     ma$    i^˘<]     cE@t-ti -$ Ø

where we might expect it, i.e. in normal (alienable) possessives (1110.a). When
E$nE@ be@ functions as inalienable possessor, the be@ drops its tone, and we get E$nE@
be$ (1110.b). These features (absence of ma$, tone-dropping as inalienable
possessor) are shared with the regular 3Pl pronoun be@, suggesting that be@ in E$nE@
be@ is (in part) morphemically identical to 3Pl pronoun be@.(1110) a. [E$nE@    be@      i $ju@]  wç&˘-tu$-ba@

subject function in non-subject relative clauses, as in (819) and (1119.b-c). By
contrast, true 3Pl pronoun be@ appears as L-toned be$ in this function.
     In (1111), the fact that 3Sg possessor wo@ instead of Refl possessor E$nE@ is
used (before i n$ e$ ga$ru@-m) tells us that the referent is distinct from that of the
initial 3Sg pronominal.(1111) [wo@    ya&˘ [wo@     i $ne$   ga$ru@-m] ti@˘         ku$<]

nominal X (as topic) followed by a ‘with X’s head’ phrase including post-

6.9     AppositionThe sequence core NP plus numeral is structurally appositional, unlike other
superficially similar sequences like noun plus modifying adjective (including
ordinals). In the case of [NP + numeral], both the final word in the core NP and
the numeral have their regular tones; in addition, the NP has its regular (human)
Sg or Pl suffix, as it would in the absence of the numeral. When the NP in
question is head of a relative clause, tone-dropping applies simultaneously to
the final word in the core NP (the noun, or a following modifying adjective) and
to the numeral. For details and examples, see §6.5, above, and §14.1.3.
     Apposition is also regular when a pronoun is “modified.” When a pronoun
(with human referent) is logically the head of a relative, it occurs to the left in
its independent (H-toned) form, in apposition to a form of i@ne@ ‘person’ which
follows. Only i@ne@ shows the tone-dropping characteristic of relative-clause
heads (397). I therefore bracket i@ne@ inside the relative clause, with the pronoun
outside the brackets. For more details, see §14.1.4.

             ‘I the person whom you-Sg know’    The same type of apposition is common when a pronoun is “modified” by a
numeral. The pronoun often appears in independent form, in apposition to a
number-marked form of i@ne@- ‘person’, which is directly juxtaposed to the
numeral (398.a). If the numeral is tu@ru@ ‘one’, when added to the proxy i@ne@-n
‘person’ it has Sg suffix -n (398.b). Numerals, especially ‘one’ and ‘two’, can
also be added directly to the pronoun with no suffix (398.c-d).(398)     a. e@   [i@ne@-m     lE$y]

             ‘The two of us, often now, the distance between the two of us
             (is …).’ 2004.5.1     It is possible to complicate forms like those in (398.a-b) by adding the noun
ku@˘< ‘head’ to the equation. In (399), ku@˘< is the immediate complement of the
numeral. The 1Pl pronoun E@mE@ is leftmost, followed by i@ne@-m. Arguably this is
a three-way apposition between the pronoun, ‘person’, and ‘head’ (note the
absence of an overt Possessive morpheme between ‘person’ and ‘head’).

(400.a), u@ can only be analysed as an independent pronoun; contrast 2Sg
possessor a@ in e.g. a@ ç$ƒç&-n ‘your-Sg chief’. With pronouns other than 1Sg and
2Sg (which have special alienable possessor forms), there is no morphological
distinction between apposition and possession. Thus (400.b) could literally
mean ‘our Dogon people’ or ‘we (the) Dogon people’.(400)   a. u@        ç$ƒç&-n

7 Coordination
7.1     NP coordinationThere is no basic conjunctive particle ‘and’, nor even a ‘with’ postposition used
in translation equivalents of conjunctions. Instead, conjuncts are simply juxta-
posed, with prosodic modifications used to express conjunction. There is an ‘or’
particle ma@ (and variants), also used in polar questions.","[285, 286, 287, 288]"

6.3.3.4    ‘Near X’, ‘far from X’Certain morphological adjectives that can be expanded phrasally. We start with
‘near’ and ‘far’ here, then consider adjectives of evaluation in the following
section. Other concepts that come to mind typologically, such as ‘be angry [at
X]’ and ‘be afraid [of X]’, are expressed in Jamsay by verbs rather than by
adjectives.
    Both ‘near’ and ‘far’ are adjectives that can take locative-adverb
complements. The complement immediately precedes the adjective.
    e@˘N ‘near’ has locative PP (or tonal locative) complements in (361). In
(361.a), the adjective is followed by the ‘it is’ clitic; we infer the presence of a
zero head noun with spatial sense (‘if it’s [(a place) [near (to) this place]]’). In
(361.b), the adjective modifies an overt noun (‘village’), which is therefore
L-toned even though separated from the adjective by the expansion of the
adjectival phrase. In (361.c), the adjective is predicative.(361)     a. [[di $˘<      nu@No$] le$] e@˘Ni^˘

             ‘The market is close to the house.’     In (362), ‘water’ rather than ‘village’ is the subject of ‘near’. The
construction is actually a relative clause with ‘village’ as head. Exceptionally,
‘villages’ is treated as (human) plural here, perhaps since ‘village’ is often used
in the sense ‘population of the village’.(362)     [a$na$        [ni@˘     e@˘N-u$m]]

6.3.3.5    ‘Good to eat’Adjectives of evaluation, notably e@ru$ ‘good’, can be expanded (in predicative

6.4     Noun plus demonstrative6.4.1    Prenominal ko$Rarely, an L-toned ko$ preceding a noun can be the Nonhuman L-toned
inalienable possessor form, in unusual combinations like ‘its father’. Much
more often, prenominal ko$ is a general discourse-definite ‘that (same)’
demonstrative with any noun (§4.2.2.A). Most textual examples involve
alienable nouns that cannot take L-toned possessor pronominals (367).(367)    a. ko$         u@ro@

modifying the same noun, as in (368).

          2SgP      Dem house
          ‘that (aforementioned) house of yours’     However, ko$ is not compatible with an inalienable possessor, suggesting
that it still occurs in the same linear “slot” as such possessors (in keeping with
its probable original morphemic identity to the Nonhuman inalienable possessor
ko$). Thus (369) was rejected by my assistant.(369)     #u$       ko$    de^˘

6.4.2     Postnominal nu@No$A deictic demonstrative sense ‘this, that’ is expressed by adding Nonhuman
nu@No$, human Sg nu$No$-ba^˘<, or human Pl nu$No$-na@m to the noun. For the forms,
see §4.4.1.1. A preceding modified noun drops its tones to all-L, showing that
nu@No$ patterns in this respect as an adjective.(370)     a. u$ro$        nu@No$
             house        Dem

6.5     Noun plus cardinal numeralCardinal numerals do not induce tone-dropping on a preceding noun (or other
preceding NP constituent such as an adjective).(371)     a. u@ro@       nu$˘y<
             house       five
             ‘five houses’
                                             6.5 Noun plus cardinal numeral   253        b. [u$ro$      E$ju@]     nu$˘y<
           [house.L good]         five
           ‘five nice houses’     In (371.b), u$ro$ has L-tone because it is followed by an adjective, not
because of the phrase-final numeral. In (371.a-b), nu&˘y< ‘five’ is one of the
lexically R-toned numerals, which are optionally (but often) heard with L-tone
when they occur the end of a phrase. The R-tone of nu&˘y< is audible before
clitics and nonfinally in phrases, as for example in (395.a-b).
     When a combination like (371.a-b) functions as head NP in a relative, both
the numeral and the preceding lexical-toned word drop their tones in parallel
(§14.1.3). In general, [noun + numeral] combinations appear to be syntactically
appositional (symmetrical) rather than hierarchical (asymmetrical).
     Human nouns take their regular Pl suffix -m in combination with a cardinal
numeral. Likewise, a noun with (human) Sg suffix -n keeps it before tu@ru@ ‘1’
(which itself has human Sg form tu@ru@-n).(372)   a. i@ne@-m     nu$˘y<
           person-Pl five

           Dogon-Sg one-Sg
           ‘one Dogon’     When a cardinal numeral follows a combination of noun plus
demonstrative (whether the latter is pre- or postnominal), the expression is
interpreted as nonpartitive. That is, the group in question is either ostensively
indicated (373.a) or discourse-definite (373.b).(373)   a. [gu$-gu$n            nu@No$ nu$˘y<]       E@wE@-y$

254     Noun phrase structure
    For partitive sense, an explicit partitive construction must be used. This
construction includes an initial “locational” with a postposition such as ga&nn$
‘between, among’ (§8.3.12) or bE$rE^˘ ‘in’ (\§8.3.3) containing the demonstrative.
The noun in question is resumed within the core clause that follows (374).

        Plural (bThe Plural particle be@ is related to 3Pl pronoun be@, and it is part of Logophoric
Pl pronoun E$nE@ be@. However, be@ has fairly low text frequency in Pl function in
nonpronominal (i.e. noun-headed) NPs. Most native Dogon human nouns can
take Sg -n and Pl -m, and the suffix preempts the need for a Plural particle.
However, most inalienable kin terms do not allow Sg -n or Pl -m suffixes, and
these do rely on be@ to express plurality: mi $ yE@s a^˘ ‘my (man’s) sister’, plural
mi $ yE@s a^˘ be@ ‘my sisters’. Other examples of nouns with Pl be@ are ja$msa&y be@
‘Jamsay (people)’ and borrowed nouns like conseiller be@ ‘councilors’ and
aventurier be@ ‘adventurers’.
     For nonhuman nouns, plurality is an optional category and is usually not
expressed. However, Pl be@ is available when the speaker chooses to express
plurality overtly: i j$ u@ be@ ‘dogs’, versus simple i $ju@ ‘dog(s)’. Examples involving

6.3.3.2    Adjectival intensifiersLike other languages of the zone (e.g. Fulfulde, montane Songhay languages),
Jamsay has a number of intensifiers that are used chiefly with adjectives,
especially in predicative function. They do not occur in my recorded texts, but
do occur in more lively conversation.
    Most Jamsay intensifiers are frozen full-stem reduplications based on
CvC or CvCv “stems” that do not occur elsewhere. Nearly all are H-toned
throughout. An example is ku@ju@-ku@ju@, which is paired with jE@m ‘black’.
    There are two constructions. In one, the semantically primary adjective
immediately precedes the intensifier and takes L-tones, i.e., it is tone-dropped
(351.a). The ‘be’ quasi-verb, if present, follows the intensifier. Here the
adjective and intensifier behave like any two modifying adjectives in sequence.
In the other construction, the ordering is the same but there is no tonal
interaction, and the ‘be’ quasi-verb is added directly to the primary adjective
(351.b). Here the intensifier patterns as a loosely attached adverbial.(351)     a. jE$m          ku@ju@-ku@ju@kç$

             [= (a)]    An intensifier may also be included with an modifying adjective within an
NP. In this case the first construction illustrated above, with L-toned primary
adjective, is used (352).(352)     [i $ju$ jE$m      ku@ju@-ku@ju@ lE&y]          E@˘-sa$-m

with distinct senses. In (353.b), the intensifier cE@tE$rE$-cE$tE$rE$ differs from most
other reduplicative intensifiers in its tonal pattern. It seems to have some
relationship with the adjective cE$tE@ applied to unusually short animal breeds.

intensifier is not in reduplicative form; I take it to be a crypto-compound ending
in a three-part reduplicative final. (355.b) is similar, but involves no
reduplication. In (355.c), the intensifier has interjection-like CvC form, though
in one case it can be reduplicated. ka@k is used in contexts like ‘he stopped still’
or ‘she stopped in her tracks’, emphasizing abrupt and total cessation of
movement.(355)       gloss                 regular stem     intensifier        a. ‘heavy’                du$ju@           cE@r<E@-nE@nE@nE@

Instead, du$gu@ ‘fat, thick’ is replaced by go@do@go@ro@m ‘massive’.
     For the cases in (356), the elicited construction involved a verb (either a
stative, or a transitive that denotes an action that leaves the object in a state),
rather than an adjective. One of the intensifiers is reduplicative, the other not.

clean-shaven, the courtyard is completely swept).
     Examples of the adverbial construction are in (357). In (357.a-b), the

‘be thin’, but this time it is chained to the intensifier, which functions as
(nonverbal) predicate. The intensifier is heard as [ka$<i@˘<], which I take as

11.1.2 Verb types (valency)Verbs have the usual valency possibilities: intransitive, transitive, ditransitive.
However, the distinction between transitive and intransitive is muddied in
Jamsay by the large number of idiomatic object-verb combinations (including
those with cognate nominals), and to some extent subject-verb combinations;
see below, §11.1.5-6.
     Intransitives that have a subject but no direct object include stance verbs
like di N
        $ e@- ‘sit down’ and atelic motion verbs like ya$na@- ‘glide’.
     Telic motion verbs like ya&˘- ‘go’ and yE$rE@- ‘come’ are basically
intransitive (with optional locational adverbial). They may appear to be
transitive, like the first ‘go’ verb in (618), which has ‘place’ as destination.(618)     [di ˘$ <  E$nE@ ya$˘-go@-Ø                ji $˘< cE^w] ya&˘ $-Ø

          ‘Places that she previously did not go to, (now) she goes.’ 2004.3.19     However, telic motion verbs, in their primary senses, often fail the crucial
test of transitivity in Jamsay: they do not take object pronominals. Informants
                                          11.1 Regular verbs and VP structure   389generally rejected such proposed combinations as #ko@ ya&˘-ya$-m ‘I went to it’,
and similar constructions for ‘come’, and ‘go out’. Therefore cases like ‘place’
in (618), above, are best understood as covert adverbial PPs with the
postposition omitted. Such omission is most common with place names like
ba$ma$ko@ ‘Bamako’, which in most contexts are understood as adverbial in
nature without an overt postposition.
     In the sense ‘go/come to (sb)’ with human destination, a PP with
postposition le$ or its pronominal counterparts is used: mi&-n yE$rE$-Ø ‘He/She
came to me.’
     There are, however, some transitive uses of telic motion verbs in non-
primary senses. ya&˘- ‘go’, for example, may take an object denoting the entire
trajectory rather than the destination. In (619), the pronoun ko@ is the object.(619)   [ki $lo$mE@˘tE@rE$     tE@˘mE@dE$    ta&˘n]
        [kilometer             hundred       three]

        [foot Inst]        NonhO go.Impf-2PlS
        ‘Three hundred kilometers, you’ll go that (distance) on foot.’ 2004.4.5     With nu@˘- ‘enter’, informants again disliked pronominal objects in
elicitation sessions, but the textual example (620) shows that they are possible.(620)   [ko$ a$na@] ko@       ba@lla@    me$y< ko@        nu@˘-be$
        [Dem village] NonhO go.around and       NonhO enter.Impf-2PlS
        ‘that town [topic], you-Pl will go around it and enter it (by the back
        way).’ 2004.5.2     Transitives include the usual verbs involving impact or creation (‘cut’,
‘knock down’, ‘hit’, and the like). ‘Have’ is expressed by transitive quasi-verbs
including sa$- (§11.5.1). There are some ‘put’ verbs with a direct object plus an
optional locational, e.g. na@˘na@- ‘put (sth) up on (sth)’. Basic perception verbs
are transitive: E@˘- ‘see’, a@ƒa@- ‘hear’.
     Defective quasi-verb ku$n- ‘be in, be part of’ functions syntactically as
though the sense were ‘be put in’ (cf. the high-frequency transitive ku@no@- ‘put’
or ‘put in’). It requires a locational complement, as in [X bE@rE$] yç@ku$n- ‘be in
X, be part of X’. An example is (621).(621)   [[wo@ je$ju$-gu$ju@] le$]    cE@lla^l   yç@ku$n-Ø
        [[3SgP body]         in]     health     existbe.in.L-3SgS
        ‘Health is in his body.’ (=He is able-bodied) 2004.4.22
390     VP and predicate structure
    Many verbs may be used either transitively or intransitively without overt
derivational morphology; see the discussion of ambi-valent verbs in §9.5. One
typical pattern is where the intransitive functions as a (medio-)passive of the
transitive. There is no productive morphological passive, so the ambi-valent use
of basically transitive verbs fills a void.
    Ditransitives include o@˘- ‘give’ and te@˘re@- ‘show’. They have a direct object
for the theme and a dative indirect object for the recipient. (There is no
“promotion” of the dative to direct-object status.)
11.1.3 Valency of causativesCausatives are formed from underlying transitives, as long as the semantics
make sense in at least some situation. Such causatives of transitives have two
direct objects (622).(622)     a. [ç$rç$-ni N

11.1.4 Verb PhraseIt is reasonable to speak of “VP” in a broad sense as a clause minus pre-clausal
topics, minus the subject NP, and minus AN inflection. This notion of
subjectless VP is operative in some types of chaining, e.g. with linking particle
me$y<, and in infinitival complements as with (same-subject) ‘want’.
     The linear order of preverbal constituents was discussed in §2.6. As noted
there, pronominals (dative, object, and in relative clauses also subject) normally
follow nonpronominal constituents unless focalized or topicalized. The normal
relative order of (untopicalized, unfocalized) nonpronominal preverbal con-
stituents is (623). This order is not rigid.(623)     a. temporal locatives (e.g. ‘yesterday’)
          b. subject
          c. dative, object, other adverbials (direct object often last)
                                           11.1 Regular verbs and VP structure        391     The relative order of (nontopicalized, nonfocalized) preverbal pronominals
is (624).(624)   a. dative
        b. object
        c. subject (L-toned subject pronominals in relative clauses)    In verb- and VP-chains, preverbal subject markers in particular occur
immediately before the final verb (e.g. the participle in a complex relative
construction), while dative and object pronominals may precede earlier chained
verbs (in bare-stem form). For examples of these ordering patterns see §2.6.
    The notion of VP is sometimes difficult to apply in chains, where two verbs
arguably (but detabably) merge into a single “compound verb” and jointly take
a single set of arguments and adverbials, or a partially overlapping set of the
same. See §15.1.5 for examples. As a result, I often refrain from using brackets
to demarcate VPs in chains.","[410, 411, 412, 413]"

for adjectives, where the nonhuman form is always available to reveal the
lexical form of the unsuffixed stem. With the adjectives (§4.5, below), it is clear
that -n and -m have no tone marking of their own; instead, the tone of the final
syllable of the stem simply extends to the suffixal nasal.
     I am aware of four suffix-taking bisyllabic noun stems that have a final
contour tone on a short vowel (168). All cases involve R-tone. The nasal suffix
is needed to permit expression of the second tone-component.(168)   ‘chief, Hogon’              ç$ƒç&-n = [ç$ƒç$-n@]
        ‘chief’s subordinate’       sa$ƒa&-n = [sa$ƒa$-n@]

        ‘weaver (caste)’            su$rgç&-n = [su$rgç$-n@]    Of these, excluding L-toned compound initials, only ‘chief’ and ‘Dogon’
(168.a) have unsuffixed nonhuman counterparts: ç$ƒç@ ‘leader (e.g. of animal
pack)’, dç$ƒç@ ‘Dogon language’.
    After a consonant-final stem, -n and -m acquire an initial vowel, usually i
with Sg -in and usually u with Pl -um, though there are some alternations
involving these high vowels. These extended variants are easily observed with
consonant-final adjectives, and arguably with a very small number of irregular
nouns (see just below).","[162, 163]"

undergoes tone-dropping, while the external copy has its regular lexical tone.
Neither instance of the head noun is pronominalized. Thus ‘a man who comes
here’ can be expressed by the construction (24), the final ma$ a&-n being optional.(24)    [a$-n      ni@-di ˘$ < yE$rE@-n$]        ma$            a&-n

3 Phonology
3.1     GeneralThe prosodic structure, involving tone patterns and vocalic lengthening, is
deeply intertwined with the morphosyntax. The segmental phonology has some
intricacies, but there are few disfiguring phonological processes that make it
difficult to identify stems and other morphemes in texts. Exception: Post-
Sonorant Syncope (60) and the consonantal assimilation rules that it feeds can
disguise the identity of (C)vCv- words and stems. An example of this is bE$rE@-
‘get’, Perfective Negative bE$l-li@- (via Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) and Rhotic
Assimilation (77)). In examples in later chapters, I frequently list the full form
of lexical items disguised in this way in parentheses after the free translation.
     There being no voiced bilabial or labiodental fricative v, I use the symbol
“v” for any short vowel, “v˘” for any long vowel, and uppercase “V” as the
unmarked symbol for any vowel (long or short). The symbol for “syllable” is .","[43, 44, 45, 46, 47]"

11.2.2.2 Locational quasi-verbs (wç$- or kç$, usually without yE@)To indicate that an entity is present in some location, one may use the quasi-
verbs whose inflected forms are given in (665). The quasi-verb wç$-, which
takes subject suffixes for the full range of human referents, is formally an
unsuffixed Perfective in defocalized L-tone form. This could be taken as
evidence that the accompanying locational expression is treated as focal, even in
the absence of a Focus clitic. Suffixally marked forms of the (positive)
perfective system (-ti -$ , -sa$-, -a^˘-, -jE$-, -tE@rE$-) are not possible. Imperfectives are
extremely rare, only a single instance of wç@˘-tç@ƒç$- occurring in my textual
corpus; see (685) in §11.2.2.5, below.(665)             category       form         a.       1Sg            wç$-m

form wç$-Ø. Animals as well as plants and inanimates and abstractives require
kç$ (except where animals are personified in tales). I gloss kç$ as ‘be.Nonh’, and
wç$- as ‘be.Hum’ in interlinears, since the nonhuman/human opposition is sharp
here. Indeed, there is a striking resemblance between wç$- and kç$, on the one
hand, and the pronouns wo@ (human 3Sg) and ko@ (Nonhuman).
     An H-toned form wç@- for the human quasi-verb is arguably lexically basic,
though it actually occurs as such only in lexical-stem pseudo-participial wç@-n
(§3.7.1.1, §15.1.1.3).
     Examples, illustrating the regular use of these forms with overt locational
expressions, and without yç@, are in (666).(666)     a. du@wa@n       wç$-m

           ‘what is there (=exists)?’    The locational ‘be’ quasi-verbs may be stretched to take adverbial
complements that are not literally locational. In (668), the reference is to fields
with mounds in rows, rather than with long furrows bounded by ridges.
Postposition le$ can mean ‘in’ or ‘with’ (§8.2.1)(668)   [nu$mo@ ma$ wç$-tu@mo@]y$< de$y ju$go@-w$]
        [hand       Poss ridgeit.is       if   know.Impf-2SgS]

        mounds in rows); (by contrast) a plow-made ridge has no segments (=it
        makes a continuous furrow).’ 2004.3.7    Relative-clause examples with H(H…)L tone, as usual for unsuffixed
Perfective verbs, are in (669). In the absence of a nonzero subject suffix, the
vowel of wç$- or kç$ must be lengthened (Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141)) to
accomodate the contour tone.

             ‘a snake that is nastier than it (viper)’ 2004.3.5    Since Existential yE@ is not used in relative clauses, the difference between
locational ‘be’ and existential ‘be’ is neutralized in relatives.
    A past time frame can be specified by adding clause-final ji ˘$ < (§10.3.1).(670)     ga$˘ru@    ni $-di^˘<    yç@wç$-Ø         ji ˘$ <
          last.year here           existbe.Hum-3SgS Past
          ‘Last year he was here.’     For specifically future time reference, an alternative expression must be
used, e.g. with a regular verb like tE@mE@-w<E@- ‘be found’.
     A preceding Existential yE@, in the assimilated form yç@, is sometimes present
in locational function (671). However, the combinations yç@wç$- and especially
yç@kç$ are more systematically used in existential function. There is, moreover,
evidence that yç@ (i.e. yE@) is associated with the absence of a focalized preverbal
constituent (§11.2.2.1). Since wç$- and kç$ as ‘be’ quasi-verbs are already in
unsuffixed Perfective form (which is used for other verbs in focalization
constructions), they cannot otherwise change in form to reflect the presence of a
focalized constituent.(671)     a. u@ro$            yç@wç$-m

they follow adjective stems in adjectival predicates (§11.4.1, below). They can
also be used with numerical predicates, as in (672).(672)   e@       [n)E-& m      na&y<]           wç$-be$     de$y,

11.2.2.3 Cliticized wç$- or kç$ after inflected verb or ‘it is’ cliticOccasionally, cliticized wç$- or kç$ is found after an inflected verb. A
distinction must be made between constructions where the verb is inflected only
for a marked AN category, and those where the verb has both AN (even if zero)
and pronominal-subject inflection. The distinction is not audible for 3Sg
subject.
     Where a verb allows both active and resultative-stative interpretations of the
Perfective, the resultative-stative sense verb may be guaranteed by adding wç$-
‘be’ (or nonhuman kç$). Compare (673.a) with (673.b). The latter has double
pronominal-subject inflection.(673)   a. i@j-a^˘-m

           ‘I am already standing.’    wç$- or kç$ (or reduplicated variant) may also be used after a marked
Imperfective verb with suffix -tç@ƒç$- (§10.1.2.10). In this combination, only the
‘be’ quasi-verb has pronominal-subject inflection (674). The addition of the
‘be’ quasi-verb emphasizes prolongation of the activity. (674.a) has Ci $-

i^˘) can also function as the Focus clitic. I do not think that y$ has focalizing
function here, but the possibility cannot be excluded. In (677), focalization is
present (ci@n ‘thus’ is commonly focalized). I therefore do not consider (677)

(instead of the usual Perfective Negative -li@-) is elsewhere observed only with
‘have’ (positive -sa$-, negative sa$˘-ra@-, §11.5.1). These quasi-verbs are limited to
the perfective system, so they allow no morphological distinction between
Perfective Negative and Imperfective Negative. In this respect they are like
adjectival predicates, which have a single Negative (not marked for aspect) -la@-.
The phonological similarity between -rv@- and -la@- is historically suggestive.

place that he didn’t go, it doesn’t exist’ = ‘he went everywhere’. In this
construction, kç$˘-rç@ is usually generalized to human as well as nonhuman
reference: ‘anyone who didn’t go, he/it doesn’t exist (kç$˘-rç@)’ = ‘everyone
went’. See §14.1.2.

6.2.2     Inalienable possessionA small number of nouns that I call inalienable have the properties in (334).
The combination of inalienable noun with a nonpronominal possessor NP
behaves like one type of nominal compound (see below).
                                                            6.2 Possessives   237(334)   a. possessed noun has H(H…)L tonal overlay replacing lexical tones
        b. possessor expressed by:
                 L-toned pronominal possessor
             or: noun-headed possessor NP (without Possessive ma$)     The L-toned possessor pronominals are identical in form to the L-toned
preverbal subject pronominals (used in non-subject relative clauses): 1Sg mi $,
2Sg u$, 1Pl E$mE$, etc. (§4.3.1). These contrast with the H-toned possessor
pronominals used with alienable nouns (1Sg ma@, 2Sg a@, 1Pl E@mE@, etc.). A noun-
headed (nonpronominal) NP as inalienable possessor has its regular form
including tones, and the Possessive morpheme ma$ is absent.
     When preceded by a possessor NP or pronoun, the inalienable nouns
themselves take a stem-wide H(H…    … )L tone overlay, realized as HHL on
trisyllables, as HF on bisyllables with bimoraic final syllable, as HL on
bisyllables with monomoraic final syllable, and as F on (bimoraic)
monosyllables. This falling tone contour contrasts with the tone contour for the
same nouns in absolute (unpossessed) position, which is usually a rising
L(L…)H contour, as in ‘I have no …’. I take the absolute form to be lexically
basic. The contrast between absolute and possessed forms is exemplified by
‘father’ in (335). Two possessed examples are given, with pronominal (335.b)
and nominal (335.c) possessors. Note the absence of Possessive ma$ in (335.c).(335)   a. de&˘        sa$˘-ra@-m
           father      have-Neg-1SgS

           ‘my father’        c. se@ydu$    de^˘
           S          father.HL
           ‘Seydou’s father’    The H(H…L) tone pattern is also found in the final element in nominal
compounds of the type [x# n^] (§5.1.5). In both, the leftmost constituent
(possessor, compound initial) has its regular tones (except for the special series
of pronominal possessors with inalienables), while the rightmost constituent has
the overlaid H(H…L) tone contour. This provides tangible morphophonological
evidence for an abstract grouping of the two constructions. However, the
H(H…L) contour also occurs with Perfective verbs in relative clauses, where
238     Noun phrase structure
both the head noun and any preverbal subject pronominal drop to L-tone. A
grand synthesis of all of these H(H…L) constructions would be audacious.
     The kin terms with inalienable morphosyntax are given in (336), below.
Those not shown with Sg suffix -n do not allow -n (or Pl -m), with the
consequence that they can only be pluralized by adding postnominal Pl particle
be@, as in E$nE@ be@ na^˘ be@ ‘their (Logophoric or Reflexive) mothers’.
     The stems in (336.a) show tonal but no segmental changes. They are
ordered by increasing syllable and mora count. Those in (336.b) involve a
change of final vowel in addition to the tonal change. Those in (336.c) require a
human suffix (Sg -n, Pl -m) when possessed, except that ‘friend’ has Sg tE^n
(apparently with frozen *-n now part of the stem) and Pl tE@n-u$m. ‘Grandchild’
and ‘master’ (336.d) are already H(H…)L, and ‘grandchild’ already has a
human suffix, so there is no audible change in the possessed forms. (336.e)
illustrates how the compound finals a&-n ‘man’ and n)E&-n ‘woman’ are outside of
the scope of the overlaid H(H…)L tone contour, which is realized on the
compound initial ti $rE$-.(336)         gloss                     absolute      H(H…)L possessed form          a. tonal change only

one (‘comrade’) has H-tone, and the others (n=13) have a rising tone contour
with L-tone followed by a single H-tone component on the final mora. This
latter tone pattern is well-designed to maximize the distinctiveness of the
H(H…)L tone overlay in the possessed form. yE$sa&˘ ‘(man’s) sister’ is unique for
a CvCv˘ noun stem in having a LR tone pattern; see (110.a) and cf. §3.7.4.6.
The exceptional noun tç@w<ç@ ‘comrade’ is also unusual in that it has both
alienable and inalienable possessed forms, e.g. mi $ tç^˘-n alongside ma@ tç@w<ç@-n
‘my comrade’.
      Kin and similar relational terms that are treated as alienable include ju@˘ro$
‘twin sibling’, i^-n ‘child’ when used in the kinship sense ‘son or daughter’ (it
also has non-kinship uses), n)E&-n ‘woman’ in the possessed sense ‘wife’, and
tç@ƒç@rç$ ‘namesake’ (<Fulfulde). By definition, these nouns show no tone change
after possessors, and take the regular H-toned pronominal possessors, including
1Sg ma@ and 2Sg a@.
      ba@Na$ ‘owner’ is usually a compound final, but it may also be used with
inalienable possessor; see (283) and discussion there.
      The other noun taking inalienable possessors is ce@ ‘possession’. This is a
grammatically specialized noun, probably related to the regular noun ci g    $ E@ or
cE&˘ ‘thing’, used in ‘whose (is it)?’ interrogatives and as a dummy NP-head with
a possessor when no lexical noun is present. The latter construction is the one
that is relevant here (337). ce@ differs from other inalienable nouns in two
respects: a) it does not occur without a possessor, and b) it does not adopt
{HL} tone contour.(337)       form          gloss            mi $ ce@      ‘mine’ (= ‘my possession’)
            u$ ce@        ‘yours’

            E$nE@ ce@     ‘his, hers’ (logophoric or reflexive)    ce@ has a nonpronominal possessor, in normal inalienable form without
Possessive ma$, in (338).

          2004.3.24    Recursion is of course possible with inalienable (as with alienable)
possession. In recursive inalienable possession, both kin terms appear with the
H(H…)L tone overlay (339).(339)     [mi $        de^˘]        nE@r<E$
          [1SgP.L      father.HL]   aunt.HL
          ‘my father’s aunt’     In the combination of a nonpronominal NP possessor and a following
inalienable noun, both the possessed noun and the final word of the possessor
NP have at least one H-tone. When the larger syntactic context requires tone-
dropping, both drop their tones simultaneously to all-L, as explained above.
This is a general rule that also applies to compounds with H-tones in both initial
and final. For example, inalienably possessed sa@ydu$ tE^n ‘Seydou’s friend’
drops its tones in (340.a), since it is followed by NP-internal modifiers.
Likewise, when recursive inalienable possession is present, both possessed NPs
drop their already overlaid H(H…)L tones. This is seen in (340.b), where the
NP in question drops its tones as head of a relative.(340)     a. sa$ydu$  tE$n          i $ne$   ga&-n

rather than inalienable in Jamsay: ma@ nu$mo@ ‘my hand’, ma@ bo@n ‘my name’.
                                                              6.2 Possessives   2416.2.3   Independent pronoun plus ma$ in subordinated clauseIn certain complex morphosyntactic constructions, instead of the usual simple
pronominal possessor (with alienable or inalienable noun), we get an
independent pronoun followed by Possessive ma$. We can tell that it is an
independent pronoun (H-toned), rather than an alienable possessor pronominal
(also H-toned), because the 1Sg form is mi@ ma$ (not ma@ ma$) and the 2Sg form
is u@ ma$ (not a@ ma$), these being the two pronominal categories that have distinct
forms as independent pronoun and as alienable possessor.
      This pattern is observable in ‘before …’ clauses. There is a (pseudo-
causative) “verb” form with suffix -wv$, but this word is treated syntactically as
a noun. If just a subject, or just an object, is expressed, the relevant NP takes
(alienable) possessor form. When both a pronominal subject and any object
(pronominal or not) are expressed overtly, the result is normally of type (341),
with m a$ even after a pronominal subject, which takes independent-
pronoun form). (The form of the object NP or pronoun is not at issue in the
current section.) See (941-2) and discussion in §15.2.4.2.(341)   independent.pronoun(subject) ma$ Object verb-wv$ …","[258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263]"

13.2.2.4 ‘When?’ (ya$Na@r<a$)The general word for ‘when?’ is ya$Na@r<a$. It can be followed by Focus y$, but

retrospective time frames (783).(783)     a. ya$Na@r<a$ nu$mo$-w<

common. As a basic interrogative of manner, yç&˘-ji $n may be used alone (784.a)

some noun X. In (785), it seems that yç&˘-ji $n combines with the following noun
tç$gu@ ‘kind’ as a kind of compound adjective modifying u@ro@ ‘house’, which
therefore drops its tones. Since tç$gu@ shifts to /tç@gu$/ in this combination, it may
be that the combination is treated either as a bahuvrihi compound (§5.2.1) or as
an inalienable possessive construction (§6.2.2).(785)   [u$ro$    yç&˘-ji $n tç@g] i $˘ ma&˘-w$<                      ma$ ?

13.2.2.6 ‘How much?’, ‘how many’ (a$˘Na@)The interrogative noun a$˘Na@ may be predicative ‘be how much?’ (787.a). For
partitive ‘how much/many of NP’, a number of choices are available. When the
relevant NP is not the subject of a simple ‘how much/many?’ predicate, it may
precede a$˘Na@ (787.b-c) with its regular independent form (including normal
tones). This can be taken as apposition, exactly as with [noun+numeral]
combinations.
    In combination with a plural pronoun (787.d), the partitive sense is stronger
(‘how many [of them]?’). In other words, a bounded set is understood, from
which a subset is selected. With a noun-headed NP, a partitive sense is most
clearly expressed by using a locative PP, e.g. with bE$rE^˘ ‘in’ or ga&nn$ ‘between,
among’ (787.e). The PP can be analysed as topical, as suggested by the free
translation of (787.e), and the pronoun in (787.d) is compatible with
topicalization as well (though it could also be interpreted as an alienable
possessor--unfortunately, 1Sg and 2Sg do not make sense in partitive contexts,
and these are the only two pronominals that have different forms for inde-
pendent pronoun and possessor pronoun). A topicalized partitive also occurs
with a numeral in (374). The noun ‘kind, type’ combined with ‘how many?’ in
(787.f) makes the partitive semantics obvious, so no locative postposition is
needed. Nevertheless, the partitive NP is again topicalized, and it is resumed by
a pronoun (ko@).

               2004.4.10    Like other quantifiers, a$˘Na@ can be iterated for distributivity, as in asking
the price per unit in the market: a$˘Na@-a$˘Na@y$< ‘how much (per unit) are they?’.
    The ordinal adjective is a$˘Na$-nE@ ‘which-th?’ (the reply is an ordinal:
‘second’, ‘third’, etc.). Cf. French (le) quantième?
    There is no simple way to express e.g. ‘how big (is it)?’ where the
quantification is over a scalar adjective. Cues of this type were always
translated as simple polar interrogatives, paired (‘is it big or is it small?’) or
simple (‘is it very big?’).","[492, 493, 494]"

5.1.9    Agentive compounds of type (x$ v@-Ppl)In this type of compound, there is a bare noun with overlaid stem-wide L-tone,
followed by a verb in participial form (Sg -n, Pl -m) but with stem-wide
H-tone. The formula is therefore [x$ v@-Ppl]. Segmentally, such agentives may be
indistinguishable from productive subject relatives with overt object (agentive
“Deerslayer” versus relative “one who slays deer”), but the tones are a failsafe
distinguishing factor, since in ordinary subject relatives the object NP has at
least one H-tone and the participle cannot be all-H tone.
     Examples of agentives with non-cognate incorporated object (or similar
complement) are in (270). I transcribe them (unlike subject relatives) as single
words. The components are listed in parentheses with their lexical tones after
the free translation. This agentive type is usual in connection with occupations
or other regular activities that define human roles.(270)    a. ta$ra$-ya@˘-m

5.1.10 Compounds with -i^˘< ‘child of’The human noun ‘child’ (Sg i^-n, Pl u@r<-u$m) corresponds to nonhuman i^˘<,
which can mean ‘child’ (of an adult animal) or just ‘juvenile (animal)’, ‘fruit’ or
‘seed’ (of plant), a small object paired with a larger object, a part of a two-part
or other complex object, or a diminutive version of a normally larger object.
There is ample room for semantic specialization for specific lexical items.
    The initial always undergoes tone-dropping. When the initial ends in a
short vowel, VV-Contraction (90) may occur (275.a), but more often does not
(275.b). No contraction occurs after a long vowel (275.c). Of course there is no
phonological change when the initial ends in a consonant (275.d).(275)    a. final short vowel of the initial is elided before -i^˘<              i $j-i^˘<

diminutive compounds with -i^˘<. Examples: gç$r<i^˘< ‘knife with curved blade’,

in e.g. Songhay).
206     Nominal and adjectival compounds
    sa$˘j-i^˘< ‘bird’ is related to the much less common synonym sa$ju@. Likewise,
mE@n ‘bracelet’ has a diminutive mE$˘n-i^˘<. Both mE$˘n-i^˘< and sa$˘j-i^˘< show
irregular lengthening of the first vowel.
    A special case semantically is ba$˘-i^˘< ‘enemy, rival’, literally ‘father-child’
(perhaps in the sense ‘father’s child’, i.e. brother or parallel cousin). Similar
compounds occur in some Songhay languages and the pattern is probably
regional.","[223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228]"

19.5.2 Clause-final ko$yThis particle is added to the end of a sentence as a mild emphatic. Similar forms
occur in Fulfulde and some Songhay languages.(1174) a. n)E&-m      yE@       de@˘-ra$-ba$          ko$y

             2004.3.8    When an original utterance ending in Emphatic ko$y is quoted, Quotative
particle wa precedes ko$y. The result is therefore [S1 wa ko$y], where S1 is the
basic proposition in the original utterance. An example is (1003).
                                                                   19.5 Emphatics   67919.5.3 Clause-final de@This particle occurs with slight phonological variation in all languages of the
zone, and is even used in local French. It seems less common in Jamsay, where
it may be a fairly recent borrowing.
    In (1175.a), the speaker responds with a trace of irritation to a vague
question about what kinds of song-and-dance festivities there are. In (1175.b),
the negation is emphatic.(1175) a. dç$ƒç$-cE$r<E$w<E@   ma$ si^˘      ji -$ jo^˘                de@

19.5.4 Clause-final ‘(not) at all!’ particles (pE@y, so@y, fE@s)Various clause-final emphatic particles, pronounced as interjections, occur in
emphatic negatives like (1176).(1176) be@           [gu$ju@-jE@mu$˘               de$y],
       3Pl           [skin-black.HLit.is-2Sg       if],

       ‘They (=Algerians) [topic], if you-Sg are a black-skinned person (=an
       African), your situation (=behavior) is not at all important to them.’
       (gu$ju@-jE^m [bahuvrihi], be$-ru@) 2004.5.4     This is the only occurrence of pE@y in my recorded texts, though I have
heard it in conversation. Elicitation brought out two other particles with similar
’(not) at all’ uses, fE@s and so@y. For so@y, whose more general sense is ‘all,
entirely’, see cf. §8.5.8.7.
     fE@s is unusual in ending in a sibilant, a possibility restricted to interjections
(and poorly integrated borrowings). fE@s itself resembles ‘(not) at all’ particles in
some other languages of the region (e.g. Humburi Senni).
680   Grammatical pragmatics
19.5.4.1 Emphatic construction with verb plus topicalized related nominalThis construction has truth-value emphatic function, as when an assertion is
reaffirmed to a skeptical audience, or when someone lays down the law to a
child or other subordinate about what will or will not happen. The discourse
flavor can be approximated by adding ‘sure as hell’ or the like to the free
translation.
    A nominal related to the verb (perhaps a Verbal Noun) is followed by
Topicalizing particle kE@ (§19.1.1), then the inflected verb form (1177.a-b).
There is no prosodic break between the “topical” phrase and the verb,
suggesting that the topical constituent is clause-internal. Where both a Verbal
Noun and another cognate nominal are available, either may be used (1177.c-d).
For verbs like ‘fight’ that are regularly accompanied by a cognate nominal, my
assistant did not accept a proposed version where the cognate nominal and the
Verbal noun (i.e. as a compound Verbal Noun) both occurred (1177.e).(1177) a. [da&g-Ø             ke@]    da$ƒa$-j-e@

uptake checks, where the speaker tests whether the listener is paying attention,
or whether uptake of a difficult passage has occurred.
    As in all local languages, expressions of the general type ‘did you (not)
understand?’ are frequently used by some speakers. The listener is expected to
respond in some way, at least by gesture or grunt. In texts from an older man,
such forms as (1179) were common.(1179) pa@˘mE@-r<a$-w<                 la$˘
       understand-Habit-2SgS           Neg
       ‘Is it not (the case) that you-Sg understand?’     In this pronunciation, pa@˘mE@-r<a$-w< is a slightly irregular variant of
pa@˘m-a@˘r<a$-w<.
     Another backchannel checking phrase, used by a different speaker
occasionally in a long recording, was (1180).(1180) ga$˘-lu@-m
       say-PerfNeg-1SgS
       ‘I did not say …’ (= ‘Did I not say …?’)    In (1180), the preceding discourse is taken retrospectively as a quotative
complement. Though there is no overt marker of interrogative status, (1180) is
evidently interrogative in function: ‘did I not say (…)?’
19.7 GreetingsA greeting sequence begins with an expression relevant to a given time of day
(good morning, good evening, etc.), or to an activity that the initial addressee is
engaged in or returning from (in a field, at a well, at work, arriving at a house,
etc.). The ABAB… sequence is initially asymmetrical (with “adjacency pairs”
consisting of a greeting and a well-defined response) but then may blur into a
symmetrical interaction where essentially the same highly general greetings are
exchanged. ta$˘re@ is used to bring a sequence (or sub-sequence) to an end, but
this may lead to a relaunch of the greeting cycle.
     (1181-2) are examples of morning greeting sequences.","[700, 701, 702, 703]"

combinable with a manner adverbial clause headed by the L-toned version of

to determine in this case whether the missing head noun is ‘manner/way
(that …)’ or ‘time (when …)’. Perhaps a locative sense ‘place (where …)’ is
also possible, though I can cite no compelling textual examples. Contextual
information and any available native wit must be used in translating such
headless adverbial relatives.
     In (954), because of the immediately following ‘how?’ question, I opt for
‘the way …’ in the free translation, though a temporal reading is also possible.(954)   [i@ne@-m      be$          a^˘-Ø                    ku$<],

15.2.8 ‘From X, until (or: all the way to) Y’The verb ya$Na@ ‘take, pick up’ is widely used to initiate (and continue) a series,
especially in the combination ya$Na@ me$y<. It can take an NP or a clause as
complement. The series is normally concluded with a phrase containing some
combination of ha^l ‘until’, ya&˘- ‘go’, and/or dç@˘- ‘arrive, reach’. The trope is
therefore of the speaker ‘picking up’ one or more objects and going (with it) to
a destination.
     One version of the complete construction is seen in (956.a), with two ya$Na
me$y< opening the series of life stages of the millet plant, and a final ha^l ya&˘.

The ladles and necked gourds form a mini-series, coming from fruits of the

15.3 Constructions with superfluous m a$15.3.1 Narrative-climax construction with ma$ plus H(H…)L PerfectiveIn narrative climaxes, it is possible to shift to a highly marked construction
ending in an unsuffixed perfective verb in H(H…)L tone (as in relatives). We
also find Possessive ma$ connecting various preceding constituents in a
somewhat profligate fashion. A pronominal subject is expressed by an
independent pronoun preceding ma$. A chained verb preceding the H(H…)L
verb has its tones dropped to all-L, in the fashion of a compound initial.
Frequently two such clauses are paired, the first of which undergoes intona-
tional prolongation ().
                                     15.3 Constructions with superfluous ma$   573    Some of these features suggest affinities with Verbal Noun complements
(§17.4.1) and ‘before …’ clauses (§15.2.4.2).
    A free translation with ‘suddenly’ or the like captures the narrative flavor.
When two such clauses are paired, a rapid-fire chronological sequence is
suggested, as in line 4 of (963). The contextual translation is ‘no sooner did …

        pi@li@we@-) 2004.4.22    The subject of ‘arrive’ and ‘go back’ nominals is expressed as a possessor,
specifically as an independent pronoun (here 2Sg u@) plus Possessive ma$.

After a second clause (‘was holding’) whose form is not relevant here, the
passage concludes with a long third clause of the same type as the first
(‘brought down’). What is interesting about this third clause is that each
constituent is linked to the following by Possessive ma$. Excluding one case
where ma$ occurs in its normal function within a possessed NP, the third clause
may be schematically modeled as [he ma$ top ma$ stick ma$ brought down], i.e.
‘he (suddenly) brought down the stick on the top’. When one does include the

preceding object NP (‘a place to put them’) is long and cumbersome is a factor
in favor of inserting ma$ before the verb here.(967)   [i n

16 Conditional constructions
16.1 Simple conditional with d ey (de$ y , de@ y , de @ ) ‘if’The unmarked simple conditional clause is of the form [S1 dey, S2]. In this
construction, S1 denotes an eventuality that has occurred, does occur, or may
occur. The pitch of dey is variable. When clause-final, it behaves as an atonal
morpheme, which then copies the final tone of the preceding word, see Atonal-
Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137). Because of the way H- and L-tones pattern
with AN suffixes, in practice we get de@y after negative verbs (if not
defocalized) and after lexical-stem pseudo-participles, but de$y in the more
common combination with a preceding positive verb.
     When non-clause-final (i.e. when followed by another particle), the basic
form is H-toned de@y. In some high-frequency combinations this simplifies to de@
(§16.1.3).
     Both antecedent and consequent clauses have main-clause form in the
great majority of cases, so their verbs have pronominal suffixes as appropriate.
dey occurs at the end of the antecedent clause, which normally precedes the
consequent, though occasional textual examples of postposed antecedent
clauses (probably afterthoughts) have turned up. The construction is very
common, and one can often translate dey as ‘when …’ instead of as ‘if’. In
other words, [S1 dey, S2] may simply indicate chronological ordering, as in the
description of a complex activity involving multiple sequential actions, so long
as there is some connection between these actions (a necessary sequencing, for
example). The [S1 dey, S2] construction therefore competes with the explicitly
temporal [[S1 (ga@˘) ka^n], S2] construction (§15.2.2.1).","[588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598]"

    Another idiomatic construction is with bE$rE@- ‘get, obtain’. There is no
Reflexive Possessor here (‘his own head’ with E$nE@ ma$) since ‘his head’ is
topicalized (presentential), and “resumed” by a clause-internal Nonhuman
pronominal.(1116) [wo@        ku@˘<]   ko$-ru@    bE$rE@ me$y< ga$ra$-Ø

18.2 Logophoric and indexing pronouns18.2.1 True logophoric function (E$nE@, E$nE@ be@)For a discussion of logophorics and reflexives in the central Dogon languages
Donno-So, Toro-So, and Togo-kan, see Culy, Kodio, and Togo (1994). Of
interest is the fact that the Logophoric in Togo-kan is given as “EnE (be).”
     The basic Jamsay third person Logophoric anaphor is E$nE@ (Sg) or E$nE@ be@
(Pl). We have just seen that the same forms may function as reflexives. The
logophoric is used most systematically when the antecedent is the sentient being
(usually human but sometimes animal) whose speech, thoughts, or intentions
are reported by the speaker. In this function, logophorics function a) to clarify
reference (by coindexation to a stable antecedent), b) to define the relevant
stretch of discourse as a quotation (often in conjunction with explicit quotative
markers), and c) to dissociate the present speaker from responsibility for the
veracity of the assertions made (‘allegedly’). Logophorics may be thought of as
embedded 1Sg and 1Pl pronouns within quotations attributed to a third-party
speaker.
     Logophorics do not behave like other pronominals in terms of tonal patterns
or ordering, suggesting that E$nE@ is a noun. Subject category is expressed, for
other pronominal categories, by either suffixes on the verb (in main clauses) or
by special L-toned proclitics immediately adjacent to the verb (in relatives and
some other subordinated clauses). Logophoric subject is expressed by E$nE@ (or
its plural E$nE@ be@), always before the verb but not necessarily adjacent to it, and
with no L-toned form #E$nE$ (1117.a-b,d-e). Logophoric subjects are NP-like in
that they require regular third person subject pronominal agreement on the verb.
While 3Sg subject suffix -Ø is inaudible, Logophoric plural E$nE@ be@ takes an
audible 3Pl subject suffix -ba$ (1117.d-e). Logophoric object is expressed by the
same forms (1117.c).

agreeing with the logophoric subject.","[669, 670, 671]"
"    The constructions (341) and (342) are cases where ordinary possessor
morphosyntax has broken down. In a “regular” possessive construction, a VblN
clause like ‘our seeing the dog’ would have the structure [our [dog’s see-
VblN]]. However, since either 1Pl or ‘dog’ (in the absence of the other) can
directly possess the VblN (‘our see-VblN’ and ‘dog’s see-VblN’), the putative
[our [dog’s see-VblN]] could create processing difficulties, so that instead of
‘our seeing the dog’ a listener might take ‘our’ as narrow-scope possessor of
‘dog’ (i.e. [[our dog]’s see-VblN], where the dog could be either the logical
subject or the logical object of ‘see’). The use of a special pronominal
construction for the outer possessor (the logical subject) obviates this.
242     Noun phrase structure
6.2.4     Recursive and embedded possessionThere are plenty of examples in the texts of multiple, non-conjoined noun-
headed NP (i.e. nonpronominal) possessors. Of course, the logical relationships
in specific cases may require different bracketings (343).(343)     a. [[X Poss Y] Poss Z]        ‘the Z of [the Y of X]’
          b. [X Poss [Y Poss [Z]]       ‘[the Z of the Y] of X]’    The type (343.a) is more typical, since it is a product of two simple
possessor-possessed pairs, one of them embedded. X possesses Y, which in turn
possesses Z. This applies to e.g. ‘[X’s dog]’s teeth’, and to complex kinship
expressions like ‘[X’s brother]’s wife’. Examples are in (344).(344)     a. [u@ro@   ma$ da@˘ra@] ma$ i $ne$          ga&-n ku$<

When the adjectives refer to distinct entities (e.g. ‘red and black shoes’,
referring to the union of the set of red shoes with the set of black shoes), the
noun is always repeated in Jamsay (‘red shoes and black shoes’). Therefore, in
two-adjective sequences both adjectives must be valid for the referent. Where
the two-adjective construction does occur, the nonfinal adjective undergoes
tone-dropping, as does the head noun (350).(350)     i $ju$    jE$m      du$gu@

dropping on both ‘dog’ and ‘black’, or whether tone-dropping is cyclical, with
‘black’ forcing tone-dropping on ‘dog’ in an inner cycle, then with ‘large’
forcing tone-dropping on ‘black’ at the next cycle.","[263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"

6.2.1     Alienable possession (P ma$ Q)The basic structure of alienably possessed NPs, with P as possessor and Q as
head noun, is [[P m a$ ] Q] if P is a noun or other non-pronominal NP. In this
formula, P is itself potentially a complete NP, and of course recursion is
possible [[P ma$] Q ma$] R]. The linker ma$ can be thought of as a Possessive
postposition bracketed with the possessor, but there is no prosodic evidence for
this bracketing, and ma$ can only be used when both P and Q are overtly
expressed.
     Pronominals (except Logophoric-Possessive Sg E$nE@) have possessor forms
without ma$. In most cases, the form of the possessor pronominal is identical to
that of the independent pronoun (1Pl E@mE@, 2Pl e@, 3Sg wo@, 3Pl be@, Nonh ko@).
However, two pronominal categories have special alienable possessor forms
(328). (For inalienable possession, see §6.2.2, below.)

form to the (human) 3Pl pronominal be@, which is used among other functions as
possessor (be@ u@ro@ ‘their house’). One could argue that the absence of ma$ after
Pl be@ in an NP is connected with the absence of ma$ after pronominal possessors
(including 3Pl be@); one possibility is to treat the two be@ morphemes as one and
the same.
     Logophoric-reflexive possessor is singular E$nE@ ma$ and plural E$nE@ be@.(331)   a. [[E$nE@     ma$       u@ro@]   E$ju$-la@-Ø]  wa@

           ‘They said (that) their (own) house is no good.’     We have just seen that be@, either as 3Pl pronoun or as Pl morpheme in an
NP, does not allow a following ma$, so the lack of ma$ in (331.b) is not
surprising. The presence of ma$ in (331.a) suggests that the Logophoric-
Reflexive pronoun E$nE@ is morphosyntactically noun-like as opposed to being a
true pronominal.
236     Noun phrase structure
     Possession, as defined by presence of ma$, covers a wide range of semantic
relationships, ranging from conventional ownership (as in several examples
above), to abstract characterization (332.a), to partitive (332.b), to a

17.3.4.2 Recognition (inference, hearsay) constructionA different construction of the type ‘see that [proposition]’ denotes recognition
(involving inference or deduction) rather than witnessing (simple perception).
Here, instead of a relative-clause complement, we get one with ordinary AN-
                                        17.3 Factive (indicative) complements   609inflected verbs (any aspect, positive or negative). As in the previous direct-
perception examples, there is no pronominal-subject suffixation on the verb.
However, now a pronominal subject shows up not as an L-toned preverbal
subject pronominal, rather as an H-toned independent pronoun (1036.a-b).
     In my interpretation, the complement no longer has a participle (with
unexpressed nonhuman head), rather a verb inflected for AN but not
pronominal-subject category. In other words, the complement clause is similar
to the subject-focalization construction, except that (in my data) the overt Focus
clitic y$ is not present on the independent pronoun in subject function. (1036.a)
is perfective negative, while (1036.b) is an imperfective negative. (1036.c) has
the ‘it is’ clitic y$ (postconsonantal i^˘). (1036.d), with the same meaning, is a
standard adjectival predicate with ‘be’ quasi-verb.(1036) a. [u@     ya$˘-li@-Ø]     E@˘-ra$-m

than direct auditory perception.(1037) a. [be@         nu@w<-a^˘]        a@ƒa@-sa$-m

17.3.5 ‘It doesn’t matter (much) that’ (sa$˘-ra@-Ø)sa$˘-ra@-Ø means ‘it doesn’t have’ (§11.5.1). In this invariant form, it may be
placed after a main-like clause (i.e. a factive complement) in the sense ‘it
doesn’t matter (much) that …’. There may be two mutually exclusive factives,
resulting in a parallel construction. (1038) is from a passage about how a
respectable older man keeps an eye out for a potential bride for a younger man
while visiting other villages.(1038) ye@ri^˘       yE$rE$-Ø             ta$Na$         sa$˘-ra@-Ø,

17.3.6 Factive obligational (wa@˘ji@bi $ ‘obligation’)The Fulfulde (ultimately Arabic) noun wa@˘ji@bi $ ‘obligation, duty’ is used as a
predicative nominal with clitic y$ ‘it is’. The following clause has an
imperfective or imperative verb. In effect, wa@˘ji@bi     $ y$ functions like an

4.7.1.3    Decimal units (‘10’, ‘20’, …) and combinations (‘11’, ‘59’, …)Decimal units (multiples of ‘10’) are in (239). pE@ru@ ‘10’ is repeated from
above. The other decimal terms are compounds with pE@ru@- ‘ten’ as the initial
and the relevant single-digit numeral from ‘2’ to ‘9’ as the final. (One could
think of them as noun-numeral combinations with ‘ten’ as the noun, but the tone
patterns in ’60’ through ‘90’ are not regular for noun-numeral sequences.)
    The final numeral in each term for ‘20’ through ‘90’ has its regular form.
The initial ‘ten’ stem is subject to tone-dissimilation (§3.7.3.4), taking (or
rather keeping) the form pE@ru@- before a numeral beginning in L-tone (’20-50’)
and the form pE$ru$- before one beginning in H-tone (’60-90’). This initial also
undergoes Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) before a coronal (except in ‘70’), and
the syncope feeds Rhotic Assimilation (77), resulting in cross-morpheme
geminates ll (‘20’, ‘90’), tt (‘30’), and nn (‘40’, ‘50’). ‘20-50’ reflect the usual
dropping of tone from R to L of ‘2-5’ numerals in phrase-final position.(239)     gloss        form          ‘10’         pE@ru@

          ‘90’         pE$l-la@˘ru@wa$ (or: pE$l-la@˘rwa$)    The decimal numerals follow a modified noun in the same way as do simple
numerals: u@ro@ pE@l-lE$y ‘twenty houses’.
    Combinations of decimal numeral D as just given in (239) plus single-digit
numeral S have the form [D [S sa@ƒa$]]. The morpheme sa@ƒa$ is not otherwise
used in the language, but based on the structure of the combinations it can be
thought of as meaning ‘plus’ or ‘remainder’. In ‘11’ through ‘19’, pE@ru@ ‘ten’ is
modified slightly to pE@rE@, and does not undergo Post-Sonorant Syncope (60),
186     Nominal, pronominal, and adjectival morphology
see (240.a). Because the decimal numeral D is not phrase-final, if it ends in a
numeral ‘2-5’ we often hear its R-tone (240.b-c). The same is true (often, but
not always) of a numeral ‘2-5’ immediately preceding sa@ƒa$, such as the second
ta&˘n in (240.c).(240)     a. pE@rE@         [tu@ru@    sa@ƒa$]

4.7.1.4    Large numerals (‘100’, ‘1000’, …) and their compositesLarger numerals are based on the stems in (241), which can be followed by
modifying numerals.(241)        gloss          form          a. ‘hundred’      su&N (archaic)

             ‘million’  mi@lyç^˘< (<French)    The archaic term su&N seems to be fading from use. In traditional Dogon
counting, there is a tradition whereby ‘80’ replaces ‘100’ as the basis for
counting, particularly with money (see below). Thus dç$ƒç$-su&N ‘(the) Dogon
hundred’ is an alternative term for ‘80’.
    The higher numerals in (242) are nouns and can be followed by other
numerals to generate larger composite numerals. However, the different levels
(million, thousand, hundred, 1-99) are separated into distinct sub-phrases. This
does not usually affect such numerals when used in counting, so that no
modified noun occurs. For example, in [[tE@˘mE@dE^r nu&˘y<] pE@l-lE$y] ‘five
hundred twenty’ there is no prosodically marked break, and the R-tone of nu&˘y<

noun is present, a complex numeral can be broken up.
     In one construction, a modified noun is repeated at each level, and each
segment has its own intonation contour (242).(242)     [pe@˘ju@  mu$n)u@ lE$y]     [pe@˘ju@   tE@˘mE@dE^r   nu$˘y<]

          [sheep      ten-two]
          ‘two thousand, five hundred, (and) twenty sheep’    In the other possible construction, the modified noun is not repeated, but the
numerals from different levels are overtly conjoined, with the “dying-quail”
final intonation described in §3.8.3 at the end of each sub-phrase (243).(243)     [pe@˘ju@ mu$n)u@ lE$y] [tE@˘mE@dE^r nu$˘y<]         [pE@l-lE$y]
          [sheep thousand two]        [hundred     five]        [ten-two]
          ‘two thousand, five hundred, (and) twenty sheep’
4.7.1.5    CurrencyNumerals with values of one hundred or more are most commonly used in
connection with currency. As in all languages of the region (except French),
currency amounts are expressed in terms of the unit sometimes known as the
riyal (real). This was originally a valuable colonial silver franc, but it is now
equated with the smallest coin in circulation, the 5 franc CFA coin, worth (in
2007) about one U.S. cent. Therefore ‘500 CFA’ (prior to 2005 a banknote,
thereafter a coin) is expressed as ‘100 riyals’. The term for ‘riyal’ in Jamsay,
borrowed from Fulfulde, is bu@˘du$ (plus a quantifier), often shortened to bu^˘d
before a numeral, as in bu^˘d tu@ru@ ‘one riyal’.
     Without a quantifier, bu@˘du$ means ‘money’. A more authentic, but now less
common, term for ‘money’ is cE&˘ru$, whose primary sense is ‘cowry shell’ (now
decorative, but long ago used as a kind of currency).
     For very large currency amounts, the French borrowing mi@lyç^˘< is used,
denoting one million (not five million) francs. One million francs CFA is a sum
that most villagers would never see in cash, though a well-constructed house in
a town like Douentza can go for upwards of ten million (in 2007).
188     Nominal, pronominal, and adjectival morphology
4.7.1.6    Distributive numeralsNumerical distributivity is expressed by iterating (=completely repeating) the
numeral. In context, distributives can be glossed adverbially as ‘in groups of N’,
‘N apiece’ (e.g. price per commodity unit), ‘N at a time’, and so forth, where N
is the iterated numeral. Simple numerals ‘2-5’ with lexical R-tone keep this tone
in the first segment, but drop it to L-tone in normal speech style in the second
segment if it is phrase-final.(244)     lE&y-lE$y       yE$rE$-ba$
          two-two         come.Perf.L-3PlS
          ‘They came two at a time (by twos).’     Other representative distributives are tu@t-tu@ru@ ‘one by one, individually,
one at a time’, hence by extension ‘scattered, occasional, (a few) here and
there’, and ku@ro@y-ku@ro@y ‘six by six’.
     In decimal units ‘20’ and up, the compound initial ‘ten’ is optionally
omitted in the repetition: pE@l-lE$y pE@l-lE$y or pE@l-lE&y-lE$y ‘twenty by twenty’.
Similar reductions occur in more complex numerals.
     An unusual construction including Nonhuman pronoun ko@ (perhaps in
possessor function) and an apparent prefix a$- appeared in a passage about
earring types, from an elderly female speaker. The construction was only half-
understood by my younger assistant (245).(245)     [su$n     nu@No$] [a$-ta^˘n        ko@            ta&˘n]

          ‘This ear (here), in three places’
4.7.2     Ordinal adjectivesOrdinals are true adjectives (unlike cardinal numerals), and therefore induce
tone-dropping on a preceding modified noun. They take Sg -n and Pl -m if the
reference is to humans.","[207, 208, 209, 210]"
"     Inalienably possessed nouns (with nonpronominal possessor NP) and
certain types of compounds have at least one H-tone in both the left and right
component when they occur NP-finally (more precisely, when they are not
followed by a modifying adjective or demonstrative). Examples include
compounds with final ba^˘< (ba@Na$) ‘owner’ or its plural na@m (§5.1.12). When
such an NP functions as relative head, the left and right components undergo
simultaneous tone-dropping.
     Unless the entire head NP is omitted (“headless” relatives, see below), the
NP-final word targeted by relative-clause tone-dropping is either a noun or a
postnominal modifier. If there is a postnominal adjective and/or a postnominal
demonstrative (nu@No$ ‘that’), this postnominal modifier will have already forced
tone-dropping on the preceding word (a noun, or another postnominal
adjective). For example, an NP of the form [dog big that] is already expressed
as [dog.L big.L that] in main clauses, as each nonfinal word drops its tones
under the influence of the immediately following modifier. Therefore the only
change the NP undergoes as relative head is that the final word, here the
demonstrative ‘that’, also undergoes tone-dropping, resulting in [dog.L big.L
that.L].
     Examples where just one word undergoes tone-dropping due to
relativization are in (809). These are cases where the NP (excluding alienable

appears in main clauses as u$ro$ da@ƒa@ ‘small house’; the noun u@ro@ ‘house’ has
already dropped its tones because of the modifying adjective. When the NP
functions as relative head, the adjective also drops its tones. In (809.c-d), the
alienable possessor pronoun (ma@, ko@) is unaffected by the tone-dropping that
applies to the noun ‘house’.
     In a [noun + numeral] sequence, in ordinary clauses both the noun and the
numeral have their lexical tones (tonal independence). When such an NP is head
of a relative, both the noun and numeral drop their tones (810).(810)   a. [n)E$-m      ku$ro$y] yE@rE$-m                   ku$<

when functioning as relative-clause heads: possessor plus inalienable noun such
as a kin term (811.a), compounds of type [x# n#] where neither the initial nor the
final changes its tones in a main clause (811.b), [x# n^] compounds where the
488     Relativization
final has an overlaid H(H…)L tone contour while the initial retains its lexical
tones (811.c), and compounds whose final is ba@Na$ (ba^˘<) ‘owner’ or its plural
counterpart na@m following a lexical-toned initial (811.d).
     In (811.e), however, we have a combination including a numeral following
a kin term plus Pl be@. Normally be@ would appear after the participle. However,
in the combination be@ plus numeral, be@ is trapped inside the clause-internal
head NP. It does, however, resist tone-dropping, as does the following numeral,
although the preceding head noun and its inalienable possessor noun do undergo
tone-dropping.

the dying-quail intonation contour, occurs as head of a relative clause, there is a
conflict between preservation of this prolonged, falling intonation contour and
application of regular relative-head tone-dropping (which would force flat low
pitch). In elicited data, the dying-quail intonation was regularly maintained on
the left conjunct. The right conjunct usually (but not always) underwent tone-
dropping. See §7.1.1.5 for examples and discussion.

thing (that…)’, and spatiotemporal and manner nouns like do@gu@ru@ ‘time’ and
d i&˘< ‘place, manner’. On the spatiotemporal and manner cases, see the
discussion of relevant adverbials in Chapter 15.
      A pronoun may not head a relative. Instead, the pronoun is placed to the
left in its independent form (with H-tone), in apposition to a proxy noun, either
human i@ne@ ‘person’ (812) or nonhuman cE&˘ ‘thing’. The independent pronoun is
external to the relative clause proper. Tone-dropping applies to the proxy noun
(hence i n$ e$, cE$˘), but not to the pronoun.(812)   a. e@        [i $ne$     [n)E-$ i^-n      yç$wç$    le@]

14.1.5 Relative clause with conjoined NP as headWhen the head of a relative is a conjoined NP, expressed by dying-quail
intonation on both conjuncts, the left conjunct has its regular tones plus the
dying-quail conclusion. The right (=second) conjunct most often takes ordinary
tone-dropped form with no intonational prolongation (814). However, other
treatments of the right conjunct are possible; see (417) and surrounding dis-
cussion.(814)     [n)E&-n      a$-n]       yE@re$-m                 ku$<

14.1.6 Internally headless relative clauseInternally headless relatives with no overt head NP within the clause are also
possible. In most such cases there is also no external head noun, but see (802)
above for the occasional internally headless but externally headed relative type.
The omission of a head NP is similar to the omission of the (implied) noun in
headless NPs (§6.1.2).
     (815) illustrates headless subject relatives. The full expansion of (815.a)
would have i@ne@ ‘person’ as overt head, while those of (815.b-c) would have cE&˘
‘thing’ as head, the head taking L-tone form in each case (i$ne$, cE$˘). In (815.d), a
pronominal conjunction ‘you and them’ (§7.1.3) is in apposition to three
headless subject relatives with ‘people’ as implied head.(815)     a. ç$w<ç$-sa&y<    do$˘-go@-m                   ku$<

4.1.3     Use of -n and -m suffix with kin termsA few kin terms of the (morphologically) inalienable class (§6.2.2) have
suffixes when possessed (as in e.g. ‘my X’), but (in general) not in unpossessed
(absolute) form (as in ‘I have no X’). The absolute and possessed forms also
differ in tones and sometimes in other ways. The full list of inalienables (with
absolute and possessed forms) is given in (336) in §6.2.2. An example is (171).(171)     ‘grandparent’              absolute          possessed Sg              possessed Pl              ti $rE@           ti@rE$-n                  ti@rE$-m
                                                                     4.1 Nouns    143    Consider now the inalienable noun in (172).(172)   ‘friend’             absolute        possessed Sg           possessed Pl             tE&˘<           tE^n                   tE@n-u$m    Here the possessed Sg form looks as though it has added Sg -n to the bare
unpossessed form (as with some other inalienable nouns). However, the
possessed Pl form treats the n as part of the stem, and adds Pl -u$m to it. Since
some inalienables show other unpredictable changes from unpossessed to
possessed forms, I will transcribe tE^n without hyphenation.
    Most inalienable kin terms lack -n and -m suffixes even when possessed.
These nouns must be pluralized with postnominal Pl particle be@ (§6.6). For
example, ‘father’s sister’ is absolute nE$r<E@, possessed nE@r<E$ (Pl nE@r<E$ be@). The
terms for ‘father’ and ‘mother’ are of this type, but they also have special
H-toned suffixed forms used with presupposed but unexpressed generic
possessor; these forms are presented in the rightmost two columsn in (173).(173)   gloss        absolute poss Sg poss Pl         suffixed Sg   suffixed Pl        ‘father’     de&˘       de^˘     de^˘ be@     de@˘-n        de@˘-m

4.1.4    ‘So-and-so’ (ma^˘n)ma^˘n is used like English so-and-so (denoting a person). It is used in generic
utterances where it functions as a variable subsuming any of a number of
individuals. It is common in indirect discourse, where it may represent an
original vocative, or an argument of a verb. For compound hi@nnE$ ma^˘n ‘such-
and-such an amount’, see (251.a). In (175), the phrase with ma^˘n is repeated,
suggesting that more than one referent is involved.(175)    [ma^˘n       ma$ e$ju@]      [ma^˘n        ma$     e$ju@]

         2004.3.6
4.1.5    Frozen Ci- or Cu- reduplication in nounsSome Jamsay nouns begin with an apparent Ci- or Cu- reduplication. There are
also one or two possible cases of i- when the stem begins with a vowel: i $-a$r<a@
‘being elegant’ (cf. a$r<a@ ‘male’ and related forms), though such an abstractive is
rather isolated semantically in this set; bite also i@-E$r<E@w<E$ ‘Spondias tree’.
     The densest concentration of reduplicated nouns is among fauna terms
(especially insects, along with some birds and mammals). The most common
form is L-toned Ci $-, though there are a few examples of H-toned Ci@-. Cu$-
usually replaces Ci $- when the following base has a u in the first syllable, as in
tu$-tu@mu@r<u@ ‘termite’. A few stems fluctuate between Ci- or Cu-, or between
Ci/u- and i/u-, for example n)i $-n)u$w<o@ or n)u-$ n)u$w<o@ ‘cold weather’ where the
alveopalatal n) may favor the Ci $- variant, and ju$-ju$w<o@, j i -$ ju$w<o@, or u$-ju$w<o@
‘mouse’, which also has an alveopalatal consonant (j).
     (176) presents the examples known to me with L-toned Ci $-, Cu$-, and i $-,
the latter in (176.k). In semantic clusters (e.g. ants) where several stems have
parallel reduplications, the reduplicated pattern seems fairly clear; in semantic
domains with few reduplications, segmentation is less transparent. In a few
                                                                      4.1 Nouns     145instances, the reduplication is omitted in at least some compounds, or there is a
related stem (e.g. a verb) that lacks the reduplication. In these cases there is
direct, specific evidence for segmentability. Within each subset, the cases with a
H-tone component following the reduplicative segment precede those with a
L-tone component; both tonal patterns are well represented.","[164, 165, 166, 167]"

5.2.1.1    With adjectival compound finalExamples of bahuvrihi compounds with an ordinary adjective as final are in
(305). The initial has its regular tones. The final has the H(H…)L tone overlay.
The type is productive.(305)     gloss                              nonhuman          human Sg          ‘belly-fat’ (=potbellied)    bE$rE@-du@gu$           bE$rE@-du@gi -$ n

       ‘Fearless’ may be of the same type: a$r<a@-ka@ju$ (Sg -ka@ji $-n), cf. a$r<a@ ‘male’
(noun a&-n ‘man’, Pl a@r<-u$m). The abstractive noun is a$r<a$-ka$ju@, where -ka$ju@
could be a frozen VblN (-ka$j-u@).
       A bahuvrihi compound functions prototypically as an adjective, modifying
a preceding noun, which takes the usual pre-adjectival L-tone (306). It may also
be used absolutely, as a noun (or headless adjective).(306)     in

5.2.1.2    With numeral compound finalA bahuvrihi compound can may be formed with a numeral as final, cf. English
three-cornered. Compounds of the specific form X-tu@ru$- based on tu@ru@ ‘one’
often mean ‘person(s) of a single (=the same) X’ (307.c), but a different

such unsuffixed Perfectives. The AN category (perfective positive) is typically
predictable in such narratives. I suspect that this is a major reason why the
""defocalized"" unsuffixed Perfective is common in narratives. Some degree of
predictability of the verb stem’s semantic content is perhaps a contributing
factor. However, in cases like ‘stripped them off’ in (550.a), the verb denotes a
new event.
    After a quotation, ‘say’ is rather light semantically. While the basic ‘say’
verb ga@˘- has a full set of AN forms including imperfectives, there is also a
common ‘say’ quasi-verb jE$- used only in the L-toned, unsuffixed Perfective
(§11.3.2).
    All of this suggests that, within the perfective system, the unsuffixed
Perfective in main clauses is associated with verb defocalization. This is an
elusive concept, relevant to the grammars of many languages, but with much
language-specific detail. In Jamsay it involves any one of the situations in (551).(551)     a. the verb is part of a large defocalized clausal residue (when some
             other constituent is focalized);          b. the perfectivity of the verb is contextually predictable and there-
             fore defocalized (as in the middle of narratives where many events
             are recounted in chronological order, in perfective aspect); perhaps
             low information value of the verb’s own content is also a con-
             tributing factor;

19.1.3 ‘Also, even’ (ka^˘<, ka@r<a$)The morpheme meaning ‘also, too’ (see below for ‘even’) is usually heard as
ka^˘<, which can easily be confused with the distributive quantifier ka^˘< ‘each,
any’. However, the particle meaning ‘also’ has a variant ka@r<a$ that is not shared
with the quantifier. In addition, the ‘each, any’ quantifier occurs in a more
limited set of morphosyntactic combinations, e.g. with a preceding unmodified
noun or a preceding relative clause, and it induces tone-dropping in the
preceding word (§6.1.4, §6.8.1). The ‘also, even’ particle occurs after a wide
range of phrases and clause-finally, and has no tonal effect on a preceding
word.
     ka^˘< and ka@r<a$ variants are interchangeable. However, ka@r<a$ seems to
occur chiefly after a pronoun or other NP. ka^˘< is more common in all positions,
but seems especially dominant in clause-final position (with clausal scope), and
in the high-frequency combination ka^˘< nE$ with nE$ ‘now’. The variant ka@r<a$
should be distinguished from the common verb ka@r<a@- ‘do’, which appears as
the form ka@r<a$-Ø in perfective relative clauses with Nonhuman head NP.
     For examples of ka^˘< in the sense ‘also, too’ see (217), (280.b), (435.c),
(556.a), (641), (671.b), (740.b), (749), (795.b), etc. For ka@r<a$ in this sense see
(315.b), (1152.a-b).
     The constituent that the ‘also’ particle has scope over is not always topical,
but it may be (1152).(1152) a. [n)E&˘-r<-u$m        ka@r<a$], a$ra@      nç$˘-w<ç@-n         de@y, …

in the same text as mi@ ka^˘<.
     The sense ‘also’ is closely related to that of ‘even’, the only difference
being that ‘even’ presupposes the unlikelihood of one out of two (or more)
parallel events differing in at least one substantive component. The distinction is
made in English but not in Jamsay, where ka^˘< and ka@r<a$ may be translated
either way depending on context. The choice of translations is fairly arbitrary in
cases like ‘even today’ (= ‘today too’) following a discussion of past practices
(1153.a). The sense ‘even’ may be reinforced by ha^l ‘until, to the point that’

"Given the Constraint Against All-L-Toned Stems (99), one could consider the
possibility that one or another of the attested lexical tone patterns is a default,
applied to underlying L-toned stems in order to satisfy the constraint. I do not
favor this (pure) constraint-satisfaction model, but if I did I would suggest final-
mora H-tone as the default. In this view, which I will call the default-final-
mora-H analysis, verbs with (monosyllabic) R, bisyllabic LH, trisyllabic LLH,
and so forth, are reinterpreted as having no lexical H-tone, with the final mora
secondarily acquiring H-tone to satisfy the constraint. The same would apply to
nouns, adjectives, and numerals that have L-tone up to a final H-toned mora.
    Possible evidence for this applicability of the default-final-mora-H
approach to nouns is provided by a small numer of human nouns that normally
(and in some cases exclusively) occur with Sg -n or Pl -m. The stems in
question have a final R-tone in these suffixed forms, and the suffixal nasal is
required to permit expression of the H-tone component of R (i.e., <LH>). The
four known examples are ç$ƒç&-n ‘chief, Hogon’, sa$ƒa&-n ‘chief’s subordinate’,
dç$ƒç&-n ‘Dogon (person)’, and su$rgç&-n ‘weaver’ (plurals ç$ƒç&-m, sa$ƒa&-m,
dç$ƒç&-m, su$rgç&-m). ‘Chief’ has an unsuffixed form ç$ƒç@ ‘leader (e.g. of animal
pack)’, with final H-tone replacing R-tone, and ‘Dogon’ has an unsuffixed form
dç$ƒç@ meaning ‘Dogon language’, while ‘chief’s subordinate’ and ‘weaver’ do
not occur without suffixes. In the default-final-mora-H analysis, these stems are
underlying all-L /ç$ƒç$/, /sa$ƒa$/ , /dç$ƒç$/, and /su$rgç$/, and the final mora secon-
darily acquires H-tone, for example in unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ and in suffixed ç$ƒç&-n.
    A theoretical objection to this argument is that e.g. unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ ‘leader’
can also be derived from /ç$ƒç&/ by a simple tone rule converting R to H tone on a
final monomoraic syllable; see Final-Cv R-to-H Reduction (154), §3.7.4.6,
below.
    Additional grist for this debate comes from tonal relationships between
underived and suffixally derived stems; see below, §3.7.3.1.
    In the sections that follow, I will suggest an autosegmental model for
Jamsay tone, while acknowledging the existence of a few counterexamples to
the rules proposed. In its strongest form, an autosegmental model of tone
separates the segmental tier from the tonal tier. Strictly speaking, the seg-
mental tier must itself be organized into syllables, moras, and feet, but since
these are derivable from the segment string I will speak loosely of these as
elements of the segmental tier.
    A stem, or a word, consists of non-null strings of segments and of tone-
components. Curly brackets {…} will be used for strings of H and L com-
ponents at stem or word level. For example, u@ro@ ‘house’ consists of uro at the
segmental level and {H} at the autosegmental level, while its tonal locative u@ro$
                                                                    3.7 Tones   97‘at the house’ has the same segments but a bitonal {HL} tone pattern. Both the
segmental and tonal tiers may be morphemically complex.
     For this model to work perfectly, there must be rigorous association
processes that connect the tone components H and L to the correct syllables
and/or moras. These processes are easy to formulate when the tonal tier is
monotonal, i.e. just {H}, since of course in this case the H component will
associate to all syllables (and moras) at the segmental level; i.e., it will spread
throughout the stem or word. The rules are also easy to formulate when the
number of tone components, the number of syllables, and the number of moras
all converge, for example bitonal {LH} for a CvCv stem. Complications arise
with bi- or trimoraic syllables, since now the association rules must decide
whether to associate tone components with syllables or with moras. The
challenges increase to the extent that the number of tone components is mis-
matched with the number of relevant segmental-tier units (syllables or moras).
For Jamsay, no pure autosegmental model will work perfectly for all word-
classes. However, it is possible to develop a model that works well for verbs,
and that helps explain statistically important patterns for nouns.","[118, 119]"

       ‘Just them and their eating bowls.’    sa&y is not as common in texts as ‘only’ forms in many other languages,
since it gets stiff competition from an explicitly or implicitly double-negative
construction including y$ la$˘ de$y (§11.2.1.3, §16.4). This means literally ‘if it
is not X’, but can extend to ‘unless it is X’ (i.e., ‘except X’, ‘other than X’), and
with implied by unexpressed double-negative ‘(nothing) unless it is X’, which is
equivalent to ‘only (=exclusively) X’.

with so@go$ ‘(rather) than’ or ‘instead of’. My assistant felt that the sense
‘instead of’ was basic, but there are some textual examples where the contextual
sense is closer to an English asymmetrical comparative. For other uses of this
particle and of a perhaps related particle so@go$n, see §17.6.6.
     When it takes a pronoun as its complement, so@go$ requires the L-toned
pronominal series, which elsewhere occurs in inalienable possessor and in
relative-clause subject functions (§6.2.2, §14.1.7), hence 1Sg mi $ so@go$ ‘instead

19.1.4 Subtopics (dey)In complex discourse, often a pair or set of entities or situations are mentioned
at the beginning, then each is treated in turn. The usual way to open a subtopic
is with y$ de$y ‘if it is’ plus an NP or adverbial, or with dey ‘if’ (§16.1) plus a
main clause. For example, in (1154), the speaker has been asked about name-
giving rituals, and begins by making a distinction between former and current
practices, which he will describe in succession.

19.2 Presentential discourse markers19.2.1 ‘Well, …’ (ha@yE$)ha@yE$ is a common presentential particle, borrowed from Fulfulde. It is used like
English ‘well, …’. That is, it often suggests a mildly adversarial element in a
conversation. However, it is often used (with no adversarial sense) at the
beginning of a quotation. It often seems to be included to signal that a quotation
is at hand, there being no other indicator at the beginning of a quotation.(1155) … ja$Na@-ba$,             ha@yE$ ya&˘ yE@rE@     ga@-ba$

19.2.2 ‘Well, in that case…’ (wa@la^˘)Pronounced wa@la^˘, French voilà ‘there it is’ occurs in texts in situations similar
to those of ha@yE$. However, wa@la^˘, more than ha@yE$, is a response to something
just said (cf. English there you are! as a confirmation). I find a free translation
‘well, in that case …’ appropriate, as in (1156).(1156) wa@la^˘   bi@rE@      bE&j-jE$-w

19.2.3 ‘But …’ (ka$˘, ka@˘, ga$˘)Clause-initial ka$˘ (most common variant), ga$˘, or ka@˘ has the adversative sense
‘but’. This is a regional form, occuring with slight phonological variations in the
languages of the zone, including Fulfulde and Songhay. I am unable to
confidently establish a lexical tone. In isolation, my assistant pronounces ka@˘
with fairly high pitch, but most textual occurrences have L-toned ka$˘ or variant

3.5.6     Vowel-vowel and vowel-semivowel sequences3.5.6.1    Hiatus between adjacent vowelsJamsay is remarkable in that most vowel-vowel sequences that come together at
boundaries do not contract. This is emblematic of the strong tendency of stems
to be phonologically autonomous vis-à-vis adjacent stems or words, except for
categorially controlled tonal overlays.
    Examples of VV combinations at boundaries that do not contract are:
possessor pronoun plus noun, e.g. ma@ i $ju@ ‘my dog’ or wo@ e$ju@ ‘his/her field’;
object or subject pronoun plus verb, e.g. ko@ E@˘-sa$-m ‘I saw it’ or ko@ mi $ E^˘-Ø
‘when I saw it’; noun plus verb, e.g. pe@˘ju@ o@˘- ‘give a sheep’ or si@ne) $ a@ƒa@- ‘hear
noise’; and noun plus adjective, e.g. ma$Ngo$ro$ e@ru$ ‘a sweet mango’.
    Most nominal compounds show the same avoidance of contraction.
Examples are ga$sE$gE$-u@ro@ ‘herd (lit. “house”) of sheep and goats’ and ti r$ E$-a$r<a@
‘male ancestor’. See, however, the following section on VV-Contraction.

suffix is -u@. Example: i@jE@- ‘stand’, Verbal Noun i $j-u@. The suffixal vowel is
subject, in some bisyllables, to Suffixal u-Apocope (67), and if it survives that
rule it may be deleted at phrasal level by Inter-Word u-Apocope (75). Since all
verbs that can take this suffix end in a short vowel, I assume a contraction (81).(81)      v + -u@     > -u@     In some, but not all, compounds where final -i^˘< ‘child’ (§5.1.10) is added
to a stem ending in a vowel, this vowel is deleted. In other combinations with
this final, both vowels are pronounced. Compound initials before -i^˘< undergo
tone-dropping in either case. Examples of deletion after a recognizable
compound initial are in (82); fortunately, they give a good range of stem-final
vowel qualities.(82)      noun        gloss          compound      gloss            comment          i $ju@      ‘dog’          i $j-i^˘<     ‘puppy’          also i $ju$-i^˘<

ja$ra$wa$-i^˘< ‘blade of hoe’, ji $re$-i^˘< ‘eyeball’, nu$mo$-i^˘< ‘finger’, and jç$Nç$-i^˘<
‘young hare’ (the initials mean ‘hoe’, ‘eye’, ‘hand’, and ‘hare’, respectively).
      A number of nouns ending in i^˘< are probably frozen compounds whose
initial is no longer identifiable. In cases like ka$r<i^˘< ‘bamboo’ and a$sa$ri^˘<
‘sedge sp.’, if they are in fact etymologically compounds they must have
involved VV-Contraction (since rhotics are not found stem-finally).
      Idiosyncratic C2-Deletion occurs in a handful of CvCv verb stems in
specific suffixed derivational or inflectional forms. The full set of examples
known to me is in (84).(84)          stem        gloss                  contracted form    category         a. ju$gç@-       ‘know’            jç$˘-go@-               Impf Negative

in (84.b) are somewhat specialized causatives in which C2 is irregularly deleted
(§9.2). For the two cases where the flanking vowels are not identical, ‘know’
and ‘sit down’, the quality of the second vowel survives in the contracted
vowel. In these two cases, the first vowel in the underived form is a high vowel,
followed by a mid-height vowel.
     Tone is orthogonal to this particular contraction process, since the tones in
the contracted forms are independently predictable. Stem-tones are always
dropped before Imperfective Negative -go@- (84.a). Causatives based on
LH-toned inputs regularly have LLH tones, so after contraction of the first two
syllables we would expect LH as seen in (84.b).
     The contraction process may be summarized as in (85). (85.a) states the
obvious: that two vowels of identical quality form a long vowel of the same
quality. (85.b) accounts for the cases involving nonidentical input vowels seen
in (84.a-b).(85)     a.     vx    +       vx     >    vx ˘         b.      v1 +        v2     >     v2 ˘

74     Phonology
     A somewhat similar problem arises in verbal morphology, when 3Pl subject
suffix -ba obligatorily loses its b after Perfective Negative -li@- or Imperfective
Negative -go@-. The results are -l-a@ and -j-e@, respectively, as in ya$˘-l-a@ ‘they did
not go’ and ya$˘-j-e@ ‘they will not go’. The deletion of b does not occur after
positive AN suffixes or after verb stems: ya&˘-yE$-ba$ ‘they went’, ya$˘-ba$ ‘they
went’ (defocalized unsuffixed Perfective). There is also no deletion of b with
2Pl subject suffix -be.
     The immediate underlying form for -l-a@ is either /-li@-ba@/ or /-lu@-ba@/ after
Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137) (§3.7.3.5). For the possible u-vowel,
compare Perfective suffix -ti -$ , but 3Pl -tu$-ba$ (§10.1.2.3, §10.2.1). With the
idiosyncratic loss of /b/, the shift of /i@-a@/ (or /u@-a@/) to -a@ is straightforward
(86.a). However, to get Imperfective Negative -go@- to its 3Pl form -j-e@ requires
a less obvious contraction of /o@-a@/ to -e@. Here the output e combines the height
features of o with the [-round] feature of a. This in turn entails fronting, since
the only Jamsay vowel satisfying these height and rounding features is e (86.b).(86)     a.     v1 +        v2        >     v2       (-l-a@)
              [+high]     [+low]         b.     v1 +     v2     >    v     (-j-e@)

              [-low]   [+low]     [-low]
              [+round] [-round]   [-round]
              [+back]             [+front]    There is a suffixal Augment with adjectives (§4.5.3), realized as -i@˘ after a
consonant or a short u, and as vowel lengthening (-˘) after non-high vowels (no
adjective ends in short i). Examples: pi@ru@ ‘white’, augmented pi@r-i@˘, wo@ro@
‘deep’, augmented wo@ro@-˘. All of the inputs involving a final non-high vowel
happen to end in H-tone; I tried, but failed, to elicit an augmented form of a
bahuvrihi compound kç@˘-ko@ro$ ‘fresh-footed’ to take advantage of the overlaid
H(H…)L tone of the final adjective (here ko$ro@ ‘fresh’). There is no parallel
elsewhere in Jamsay to the -˘ variant that could give us guidance as to how it
should be analysed phonologically. One could argue for /-i@˘/ as the underlying
basic form in all cases, but the realization as -˘ after non-high vowels diverges
from the contraction pattern seen in compounds of -i^˘< (above), where we get
output -i^˘< even after a non-high short vowel. One could therefore recognize
two allomorphs of the Augment, -i@˘ and -˘, where the latter is modeled as
underlying -v@ (underspecified vowel, long or short). The contraction process
can then be summarized as (87).

            [-high] [undersp]     The ‘it is’ clitic (also the Focus morpheme), whose phonology is covered in
detail just below (and cf. §11.2.1, §13.1), has allomorphs y$ (with variant y$<
by Nasalization-Spreading) and i^˘ (with variant i $˘ after final F-tone). Of
interest here is the fact that the vocalic allomorph occurs after a consonant or a
short u, and in the latter case the u disappears: to@gu$ ‘shed’ and to@gi $˘ ‘it’s a
shed’; ta@ru@ ‘egg’ and ta@ri^˘ ‘it’s an egg’. The tone of the deleted /u/ is a factor
in the output tone, as this tone amalgamates with those of the clitic. <HHL>
simplifies regularly to <HL>, while <LHL> reduces idiosyncratically in this
clitic to <L>; see Clitic <LHL>-Reduction (§3.7.4.7, below).(88)     a. u@ + i^˘     >        i^˘
         b. u$ + i^˘     >        i $˘       There are two V-initial AN suffixes on verbs that contract with a preceding
verb. The Habitual suffix could be represented either as /-a@˘ra$-/ or as /-a@ra$-/ ; I
cite it as -a@˘ra$-. It never occurs after a consonant, so it always undergoes
contraction with the final vowel of the verb stem (which is long in monosyllabic
stems, otherwise short). Monosyllabic stems like nç&˘- ‘drink’ and de@˘- ‘carry’
combine with -a@˘ra$- to give e.g. nç&˘-r<a$- and de@˘-ra$-, so here the suffix-initial
vowel is effectively obliterated. By contrast, when -a@˘ra$- is added to a non-
monosyllabic stem, the stem-final (and necessarily short) vowel is obliterated:
bi r$ E@- ‘work’ and dç$ƒç@- ‘finish’ have suffixed forms bi $r-a@˘ra$- and dç$ƒ-a@˘ra$-. In
(89.b), v1 is understood to be a short vowel.(89)     a. v1˘ + a@(˘)        >   v1 ˘
         b. v1 + a@(˘)         >   a˘    There is also a Perfective allomorph -a^˘- with clearly long vowel. It is not
used after monosyllabic stems, but it behaves like -a@˘ra$- with nonmonosyllabic
stems: dç$ƒç@- ‘finish’, Perfective dç$ƒ-a^˘-.
    The various VV-Contraction subrules considered above do not converge
onto a single formalization. The data are summarized in (90).

phonology. It is largely unsullied by the “functional” factors (preservation of
morphemic information) that complicate the suffixal and clitic cases.
Fortunately, the C2-Deletion cases provide useful evidence about both length
and quality features. However, C2-Deletion affects only four verb stems, and the
process sheds no light on the contraction treatment of front-back or disharmonic
input-vowel combinations, nor on tones.","[93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98]"

10.2.4 Tones of subject pronominal suffixesExcluding Nonhuman kç$ in the unsuffixed Imperfective, the nonzero pro-
nominal suffixes have no intrinsic tones. Instead, they acquire a tone from a
preceding morpheme (including the floating L-tone that characterizes the
unsuffixed Imperfective). Surface patterns are given in (591), using 1Sg -m to
represent the single-C suffixes, and 2Pl -be to represent the syllabic suffixes.

                                     (occasionally …v$-m@, …v$-be@)      Pattern (591.a) occurs when the pronominal-subject suffix is added to
Perfective Negative -li@- or to Imperfective Negative -go@-. Thus bE$rE$-go@-Ø
‘he/she cannot’, 1Sg bE$rE$-go@-m, 2Pl bE$rE$-go@-be@. See Atonal-Morpheme Tone-
Spreading (137).
      (591.b) is the pattern for the unsuffixed Imperfective. Examples: bE$rE@-
‘get’, unsuffixed Imperfective /bE$rE@- + L/, hence 1Sg bE$rE@-m$, 2Pl bE$rE@-be$. The
floating L-tone is grafted onto (i.e. docks on) the suffixal mora; see Tone-
Grafting (131).
      In (591.c), the Perfective suffix allomorph -a^˘- has its own intrinsic F-tone
(i.e. <HL>). The final L-tone component spreads to a syllabic suffix, as in 2Pl
-a^˘-be$, again by Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137). When -a^˘- is part of a
trimoraic syllable including a suffixal nasal, as in the 1Sg form, the F-tone is
spread out over the whole syllable; see Contour-Tone Stretching (143).
Examples: 1Sg do$g-a^˘-m ‘I am finished (=have gotten thin)’, 2Pl do$g-a^˘-ba$.
      (591.d) is the pattern for the (all-L-toned) unsuffixed Perfective, and for all
remaining nonzero positive AN suffixes, all of which end in a L-tone
(Perfective -ti $- or -yE$-/-ya$-, Resultative -sa$-, Recent Perfect -jE$-, Experiential
Perfect -tE@rE$-, Habitual -a@˘ra$-, marked Imperfective -tç@ƒç$-). Examples:
Perfective la@ƒa@-ti -$ Ø ‘he/she hit’, la@ƒa@-ti -$ m ‘I hit’, and la@ƒa@-ti -$ be$ ‘you-Pl hit’;
unsuffixed Perfective la$ƒa$-Ø ‘he/she hit’, la$ƒa$-m ‘I hit’, and la$ƒa$-be$ ‘you-Pl
hit’.
      In the unsuffixed Perfective, an ostensibly L-toned pronominal-subject
suffix occasionally appears with unexpected H-tone, although the preceding
stem is entirely L-toned: la$ƒa$-m@ ‘I hit’, la$ƒa$-ba@ ‘they hit’ (for the more usual
la$ƒa$-m, la$ƒa$-ba$). This is most common when the word is pronounced in
isolation, and reflects a constraint (not generally implemented in phrasal
contexts) against all-L-toned words. Cf. discussioin of related issues in §3.7.1.5.

usual clause-final position it has L-tone. An R-toned variant is possible when it
is followed by another element within the clause (see below).
     The particle is especially useful after predicates that lack aspectual
marking: adjectives and other statives, unconjugated (or conjugated) ‘it is’
clitic y$ ‘it is’, and ‘be’ and ‘have’ quasi-verbs. It is also common after regular
imperfective verbs, placing the eventuality in the past (‘used to do’, ‘was

this time in the form j i& ˘$<-. The preceding verb takes its regular lexical tone and
is uninflectable, showing that a verb-chain is at hand. j i& ˘$<- itself is morpho-
logically an unsuffixed Imperfective, implying an R-toned lexical form /j i&˘</
onto which the extra L-tone of the unsuffixed Perfective is grafted to produce a

mora, by regular phonological rules; see Tone-Grafting (131), Contour-Tone
Stretching (143), Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137). That ji&˘$<- is an
unsuffixed Imperfective is demonstrated by the fact that a Nonhuman subject
requires a following cliticized ‘be’ quasi-verb kç$, a unique feature of this AN
category. Other subject categories have their usual suffixal forms. The sense of
this construction is ‘(does/will do) in the meantime’ (i.e. while waiting for an

        the work (=techniques) of hunting.’ 2004.3.16    If the predicate is negated, the sense is ‘(not) yet’, equivalent logically to
‘(not) up to now’ (598).

10.4 Imperatives and Hortatives10.4.1 Imperatives and ProhibitivesThe forms of the Imperative (Imprt) depend on polarity and on addressee
number. The positive Imperatives are based on the Imperative (Imprt) stem. For
nearly all monosyllabic (C)v˘- and short-voweled (C)vCv- bisyllabic stems, the
Imperative is an all-H-toned stem (C)v@˘- or (C)v@Cv@-, the shift being audible in
the case of R-toned (C)v&˘- and LH-toned (C)v$Cv@- stems (see below for a few
exceptions where the shift to all-H does not occur). Other stems, including
bisyllabic long-voweled (C)v˘Cv- stems, and all stems of three or more syl-
lables, use their lexical form as the Imperative.
    The Imperative stem always ends in an H-tone. The subject suffix is zero
for singular, L-toned -y$ for plural addressee. The negative imperative (i.e.,
Prohibitive) is characterized by a suffix -y@ added to an L-toned form of the
verb stem; la^y is added if the addressee is plural.(599)     addressee         positive imperative negative (prohibitive)          Sg                Imprt stem          L-toned stem plus-y@
          Pl                Imprt stem plus -y$ L-toned stem plus -y@ la^y     There is some potential for homophony between the singular Prohibitive in
-y@ and the 1Pl unsuffixed Perfective in -y. Both follow all-L-toned stems. The
1Pl suffix is usually L-toned after an unsuffixed Perfective, in which case there
is no homophony. However, in an all-L-toned word, a nonzero pronominal-
subject suffix is sometimes realized with a H-tone, especially in isolation or
before a clause-final particle. For example, go$˘-y@ ‘don’t go out!’ is audibly
distinct from go$˘-y ‘we went out’ in the usual case where the latter is clause-

above, ‘we went out’ may also be heard as go$˘-y@.
     For monosyllabic (C)v˘- stems, homophony between the singular
Prohibitive in -y@ and the Verbal Noun (allomorph -y@ after monosyllabic stem)
also threatens. However, it is avoided in that the stem vowel is shortened in the
Verbal Noun but not in the plural Imperative: go$˘-y@ ‘don’t go out!’, but go$-y@
‘going out (VblN)’.
     The Imperative and Prohibitive forms for ‘come’ are given in (600). Note
the H-tone Imperative stem yE@rE@-, compare the LH tone of the lexical stem
yE$rE@-. Note also how the tones distinguish yE$rE$-y@ (600.b) from yE@rE@-y$ (600.c).(600)   a. yE@rE@

imperative), da$na$Na$-y@< (singular Prohibitive), da$na$Na@-y$< (plural Imperative),
da$na$Na$-y@< la^y (plural Prohibitive). Note that the (positive) imperatives retain
the lexical LLH tone, since the shift from LH (or R) basic form to all-H
imperative stem is confined to monosyllabic and short-voweled bisyllabic
stems.
     The textual examples below are singular Imperative (601.a), plural Imper-
ative (601.b-c), singular Prohibitive (601.d-e), and plural Prohibitive (601.f).
Note that in (601.a) only the final verb ‘receive’ is Imperative in form; the
preceding verb yE$rE@ has its lexical tones as an ordinary chained verb. Likewise
in (601.e), where da$ƒa@ ‘leave’ is in chained rather than Prohibitive form.(601)   a. [i^-n      ku$<]       yE$rE@       yç@wç@

10.4.2 Irregular {LH} imperative stemsAs noted before, most monosyllabic Cv˘-, and short-voweled bisyllabic
(C)vCv- stems require all-H tone in the Imperative stem. Regular examples:
monosyllabic ja&˘<- ‘dig’, Imperative ja@˘< ; bisyllabic di g      $ E@- ‘follow’, Imperative
di@gE@ (note the tone shifts).
     A few R-toned monosyllabic or LH-toned short-voweled bisyllabic stems
irregularly preserve their lexical tones in the Imperative stem. Those known to
me are ya&˘- ‘go’, di N$ e@- ‘sit down’, i n
                                           $ e) @ ‘lie down, go to bed’, and ya$Na@- ‘look;
pick up’. The Imperatives are ya&˘ ‘go!’, di N       $ e@ ‘sit down!’, i$n)e@ ‘go to bed!’, and
ya$Na@ ‘look!’
     For wç&˘- ‘kill’, I recorded a special positive Imperative form wç&˘ ti@-, hence
singular Imperative wç&˘ ti@ ‘kill!’ with plural /wç&˘ ti@-y$/ (= wç&˘ ti^˘-Ø). Here wç&˘
appears to be the bare stem, followed (in a verb-chain construction) by ti@- as the
inflectable stem. This ti@ may be related to the Linker ti@ that occurs in some
verb-chains with chronological-sequencing sense (§15.1.16), but the precise
relationship is unclear. The corresponding Prohibitives of ‘kill’ are regular and
omit ti@-, hence singular wç$˘-y@ ‘don’t-Sg kill!’, plural wç$˘-y@ la^y ‘don’t-Pl kill!’.

Imperative of cE@˘<- ‘slaughter, cut the throat of’, which of course has a lexical
sense very similar to ‘kill’.","[395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403]"

4.7.2.2    Other ordinals (suffix -nE@)For numerals above ‘1’, ordinals are expressed by adding a suffix -nE@. The
preceding numeral (including composite numerals like ‘eleven’) drops to L-tone
within a level, but if there is a mix of levels (with elements from two or more of
the sets ‘1-99’, hundreds, thousands, and/or millions), tone-dropping does not
cross the phrasal boundary separating two levels. Thus tone-dropping affects the
simple numerals in (247.a-b,d), and the tripartite but single-level numeral in
(247.c), but it affects only the final part of the complex numeral in (247.e),
where ‘hundred’ retains its normal tone.
    For ta&˘n ‘three’, the ordinal is the slightly irregular ta$y-nE@.(247)         form                           gloss          a. single-digit numeral

4.7.3    Fractions and portionsThere are no terms denoting precise numerical fractions of the type ‘half’,
‘(one) third)’, and the like. The relevant sense is communicated pragmatically
by expressions based on a noun such as go@jo$ ‘part, division’ (of an object) or
ku$ru@ ‘(somebody’s) portion, share’, or the adjective ga$ma@ ‘certain (one(s)s, of
a group), some (of a mass)’ (special human Pl ga$ma$ na@m).(248)    a. [ma&Ngo$lo$ ma$ go@jo$]y$        mi&-n       o$˘-Ø

5 Nominal and adjectival compounds
5.1     Nominal compoundsThe combinations noun plus adjective, and noun plus demonstrative (nu@No$),
require tone-dropping on the noun (§6.1.4). This is suggestive of compounding,
since the initials in some noun-noun compound types also drop their tones. In
this section, I discuss phenomena that are more obviously compounds in nature.
     A number of formulae for tone patterns are distinguished in the sections
below, using “x” for a compound initial of variable word-class, “a” for
adjective, “n” for noun, “v” for verb, and Ppl (as usual) for Participial suffix. A
macron (e.g. in “x#”) means that the constituent in question retains the same
tones that it has in isolation. A grave accent (“x$”) means that all tones in the
relevant constituent are dropped to low. An acute accent (“x@”) means that all
tones are raised to high, and a circumflex (“x^”) denotes an overlaid H(H…    … )L
stem-wide tone pattern.","[211, 212, 213]"
