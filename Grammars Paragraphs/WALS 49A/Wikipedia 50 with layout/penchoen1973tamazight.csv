taking into consideration Basset's figures in 1952 and the growth of the population since then, that
there must be today close to ten million speakers of a Berber language/dialect:    in Morocco, prob-
ably 6 million,    in Algeria perhaps          2-1/2 million,   elsewhere another      million or so.    Berber does
not seem to be disappearing rapidly, though the spread of public schooling will undoubtedly have
an accelerating effect on its regression.     For the moment, it is maintained strong by the fact
that it is the language of the home,   of the  women.   Berber children thus learn it as their first
language and the girls grow up with it and pass it on to their children.     The separation of male
and female societies works to maintain the language.

0.4   WRITINGBerber is a spoken language for the most part without any written history to speak of. The Tu-
aregs maintain a Berber writing system which is called      Tifinagh     (a plural, apparently re -
lated to the word   Punic).*     This alphabet derives historically from the ancient Libyan alpha-
bet known to us through inscriptions found across North Africa, especially in Tunisia and Alger-
ia.  Unfortunately, the inscriptions, of which the language is the ancestor of modern Berber,
have not yet produced enough information for us to venture any overall description of the old
language.   Although the alphabet has been handed down over a very long period it does not seem _
ever to have been used for recording history, literature or anything of the sort.      That is  at
least what we must assume in the absence of any surviving documents of the intervening period.
Modern use of the alphabet seems to be restricted to writing of formulae of magical signifi-
cance on rocks, finger writing on the palm of a friend's hand on occasions when silence is re-
quired, and, more recently, for writing letters.","[8, 9]"
"Certain lax articulations in Tamazight Berber, and more generally in most dialects of central                                                       -
and northern Morocco and northern Algeria, have become spirants in most environments. This
is the case for those lax articulations                            in the chart which are underlined:               /b/         is phonetically
{[81,         /t/      is phonetically             [6},          /d/     is   [38],    /d/      is    [3]       /k/       is [ ¢]        (roughly
the palatal          fricative       that most          English    speakers    pronounce     at the beginning         of the word        huge),
/g/       is almost identical with,                     but in most subdialects        more     fricative than,           ly],       /k¥/      is
a      [¢W]          and     /g*/          is virtually the same as, but more fricative than, [w                          ].
The reason for not using the conventional phonetic symbols for these phonemes is,     fundamen-
tally, that this would obscure the relationship between these lax phonemes and their tense cor-
respondents in morphological alternations.*    In verbal morphology in particular, but also in
noun     morphology,               one    form    has    a tense       consonant   where    another    has   lax.     Tense         consonants
are thus most usefully represented, when practical, by the same                                        symbol       as the lax,      either dou-
bled - as here - or in upper case or with a diacritic etc.",[11]

3.6      PREPOSITIONSBerber prepositions other than i 'to', must be classed into at least two groups on the basis of
both morphology and syntax.   What will be called here basic    prepositions,®   distinct  also
because they may introduce indirect relative clauses (e.g. the man with whom ...), have differ-
ent morphological shapes according to whether they are followed by a noun or by a pronoun.
When      followed by a pronoun,                  they are augmented            by at least a vowel              in all cases:

form.  The preposition i ‘to, for', introducing a relative clause,                                          takes the form       mi.","[33, 34]"

3.1.3             StateBerber nouns vary in form according to the construction of which they are a part.       The alter-
nation, which affects the first syllable, appears to be similar to a case marking but because it
does not seem synchronically to correspond with an identifiable case relationship it has      been
called a mark of 'statet.   The normal state (French   état-libre     or 'free state') is the cita-
tion form of a noun (all nouns given so far are in the normal state).    This form is used in all
syntactic environments except those in which the construct state (French      état    dtannexion
or         état       construit)              is used,     i.e.-         when      the noun       is subject        of the     (verbal)     utterance        and     is placed     after the verb-         after     prepositions~         in noun         complement         constructions        and    after      at least     certain       numerals}¢The         construct        state     is formed         from     the normal         state of the           noun   in the following manner:(a) Vowel initial nouns (masculine in all but two cases) are prefixed                                                     with   w     if the initial vow-
el (prefix or stem~initial) is a or u, with y if the vowel is i.(b)         The     gender-number             prefix     vowel     is dropped         (affects       masculine      and     feminine     nouns).","[24, 25]"

2.3          PHONOTACTICS2.3.1          Consonants(a)   Pharyngealization. The consonants listed above as emphatic - the term is the traditional
one for what is, in the case of Berber at least, better described as pharyngealization (i.e. the
drawing back of the mass of the tongue toward the pharynx at the same time as the basic ar-
ticulation is made) - have a strong effect on neighboring consonants and vowels, result in the
pharyngealization of the syllable and may result  in pharyngealization of the whole word.    The
word         /tamttutt/                       ‘woman’ could usually be transcribed as[ Jamettut                                     1.

larly at the end of a syllable, takes the same voice characteristics as the following consonant.     borrowing        of lax /q/    from Arabic, we could simply transcribe the tense correspondent                                                         /qq/
     as /yy/.           Likewise the borrowing, in a number of words, of lax /{/ andtense /dd/                                                              from
     Arabic makes                 /tt/          a better transcription for the tense correspondent                              of lax      /d/ than would
 be      /dd/.                                                                                                                               ™
     The case of 'tense'                      /yy/       is almost certainly related to another phenomenon:                                /gW/         and     /g/
 which,          as we           have    pointed       out,        are    very     close      to - and       in some subdialects identical            (in     cer-
 tain positions) with - [w'7] and [y]     respectively,                                                    are articulated as  [ww]                  and Lyy]
 when they are medial in bisyllabic words: /y-gWt/                                                         ‘he struck'   ) [iwwee],                  /y-ga/

     tive words involved are, precisely, bisyllabic with medial /y/: /ayu/      ‘milk’    Layyul],
     /tayatt/     ‘nanny goat' [ gayyat]     . In all these cases we are apparently dealing with a
     case of lengthening, or gemination under certain stress conditions and not the tense ~ lax
     contrast.  There is thus every reason to transcribe these words    phonemically     with a lax
     consonant.",[13]
"3.1.2.2       Other     Plural        FormationsIt is preferable         that we        deal   separately,             for nouns      which       do not fall into the basic                  regular pat~

"3.5.3   Indirect       PronounsThe pronouns used after basic preposition    (see below), the kinship noun possessive  pronouns,
indirect object pronouns - which like direct object pronouns are positioned with regard to    the
verb according to syntactic conditions - and the so-called possessive pronouns are clearly close-
ly related:
When preceded by a vowel the form is                                 yi.
*This    is   a   reflection     of the fact         that the            original       form   of the pronouns                    was       with       k     or      k”.
  Preceded by the         ad     particle,         the   d         is assimilated to the following                            k        or       k¥.        The      kof

  ‘meat'),    or in verb        stems       commonly          used with           the causative           prefix         ss            (e.g.          kned        ‘burn’
  (intrans.), sseknod                  ‘burn’ (trans.)),             or, finally, when followed by                                u    (e.g. takurt). Oth-

"4.4.2          Locative     SentencesLocative sentences, as stated, are made up of a prepositional phrase and a noun phrase.      In
Ayt Ndhir Tamazight, only the prepositions yar      ‘toward, to’ and y ‘in' are used regularly
in this type of sentence, Virtually without exception, the prepositional phrase is pronominal,
           -with       topicalization     (see 4.7.1         below)                            Sa       ur   t-id            yiwi

                            'He didn't bring a bit'7I.e.    a sentence         that    is direct      object    of the verb.           See   4.6.2       below.

the pronominalized           noun    phrase       being      topicalized         if,     in the context in question,         it needs    to be
expressed:             aryaz-ad     yur-s                   tafunast
             man this     to him                  cow
             'This man has a cow'             awal-ad            diy-s            Imoena
             word this         “in it            meaning
              ‘This   saying has         (2) meaning'It is rather clear from internal Tamazight data that these sentences should be considered    as
underlyingly identical with sentences which contain the verb ili ‘be, exist’.   The same mean-
ing is, for instance, very often rendered by a verbal sentence with ili, the noun the exist-
ence of whose referent is being affirmed being the subject and, if placed after the verb, in the
construct state:®             aryaz-ad           tolla          yur-s         tfunast             awal-ad           tella           diy-s         Imsena
4.4.3      Identity   SentencesThese    sentences     are made          up of two noun phrases juxtaposed without linking element.                                     In it's
simplest     form,    this    sentence         type   is virtually       only          used   a) for naming (subject first, usually)              ism      uryaz-ad                  husa
              name     of man  this              Husa
              'This   man's name is              Husa'b) for   exclamations        with    a demonstrative              aya       as     second      element,   the   subject:              i¢ib     aya
              shame this
              'This is shameful'One may consider however, that cleft sentences (see 4.7.2 below) are of the same type funda-
mentally, the clefted noun phrase - the predicate - being juxtaposed with a noun phrase consis-
ting of a demonstrative element ay followed by a relative clause:              aryaz-ad              ay   d~-iddan
              man     this  that near who                 perf.      come
              'It's this man who came'Paraliel with the case of locative sentences,                           identity sentences should be considered as under-
lyingly identical with verbal sentences which                           contain the verb g ‘'be' (and 'make, do’):            ‘ism      uryaz-ad            iga         husa
              'This   man's     name      is     Husa’
® Other evidence is to be found in the negation of these sentences and the use                                             of ili whenever
  one of these sentences is subordinated, i.e. a relative clause or conjunctive                                            sentence, and in
  cleft constructions.

might cali the 'root' - though the term is used somewhat loosely here and is rendered       impre-
cise by the fact that the vowels of certain roots change and one of their consonants may change

pronunciation and is subject to a variety of phonetic realizations according to the environment in
which it is found, but all of which have in common the impression of a syllable that they pro-
duce.   The conjugations give us an opportunity to observe, in more detail, how the shwa inser-
tion rules apply and to make further remarks on them.","[99, 100]"
"Also not predictable,                             and somewhat                  surprising,           is the fact that                     /w/     +       /w/         does not become

0.5   POSITION     IN AFROASIATICMost scholars consider         Berber - or 'Libyan' as some prefer, in order to clearly     include the
ancient Libyan language        - as one of the five branches of the Afroasiatic (Hamito-Semitic) Lan-
guage family, the other        four being Semitic, Egyptian, Cushitic and Chadic.   Recently, however,
links with Akkadian, an        ancient Semitic language, have been brought forth as an argument in
favor of considering        'Libyan'   and Semitic as one branch.*

  suggests       treating these endings                as the regular           n     or      in    suffixes preceded            by elements - vowel
 (an), semivowel   (won, yen, win)      or consonant t (ten, tin)      or a vowel and    a semi-
 vowel   (-awen,  iwen)   - which belong to the noun stem in the plural.    Thus the above   plu-
 ral forms may be transcribed  with the suffix hyphen before the (6)n    or  in  ending  and  the
  formal difficulties treated as stem alternation.®  (c)      Stem vowel alternation.                 A large number           of nouns undergo a vowel alternation within                                 the
  ®Simplicity          in the description           of the    suffix thus           results        in added   complexity         elsewhere        and     no
       particular economy          is realized.            Preference       for this presentation               is,     however,       quite highly jus-
       tified.    That the added elements, except for t, were formally part of the singular stem as well
       seems rather clear from internal evidence: e.g.               a-meoksa     'shepherd', plur. i-meksaw -
       en,     but feminine ta-moksaw-t,                plur.  ti-meksaw-in,          uska     ‘hound’, plur. “uskay-
       en,     but feminine t-uskay-t,            plur.     t-uskay-in,     i.e.  the  feminine     singular form has
       maintained the full form of the noun stem; or from cross-dialect (cross-language) evidence: e. g.
       Tamazight      afer     ‘wing', plur.    afr-iwon        but Djebel Nefusa (Libya)        afriw        ‘wing’, plur.
       ifriwon.        It should   be noted  here   that   the absence  of stem  final   w  or    y    in the    masculine
       singular cannot be accounted for by a synchronic rule which drops final semi-consonant after
   vowel        since there are a number                   of cases where             it is maintained,          e.g.       uday      ‘Jew'     ) uday-
    en,       For t (ten, tin),      there are strong indications that it was formerly, in fact, a plural mar-
       ker, the same one which we will find with the plural possessive pronouns used with       kinship
       nouns (see 3.5.3 below).    Synchronically, however, probably as a result of back formation from
       the plural form, the t is very often treated as part of the stem: e.g. anu        ‘well,    plur.
        anuton,        has a feminine             singular diminutive form                     {t-anut-t         'small well'         (plur.    ¢ -anut -
        in).  There is thus partial justification for treating this t as part of stem alternation. There
        is however evidence which, in a more detailed study, would lead us to greater caution. There
       are, notably, a number of derived feminine singular forms which, like t-anut~t,           ostensi-
       bly have a stem final t which is not present in the corresponding masculine stem but which
       camot be explained as a back formation from the plural form(s)       since no t appears     there:
        e.g.   ta-xbut-t            'small hole'           from        a-xbu          ‘hole’,       has a plural        ti-xba           (mase.     plur.
        i-xba).         It is,    in fact,        always     the case that when                a feminine      is derived         from a       masculine
        noun with final vowel             it is provided with a stem                  final        t (which with the feminine              t which fol-
        lows   it becomes        t-t).          Further,     no    feminine         noun   may       end   in vowel     +   t;   all which have     stem
        final vowel, derived or not, have final tt.                         As this goes to press,                I learn        that Jilali Saib has          ~
        been working independently on an approach                          to this problem.","[21, 22]"

8.3.2      Demonstrative               PronounsThe préceding demonstrative suffixes, minus their initial vowel if there is one, may be attached
to a pronominal base to form demonstrative pronouns.      The pronoun base is variable in number
and gerder if the referent is characterized by gender:   initial w   characterizes the masculine
pronouns, initial t the feminine.    This consonant is followéd by a in the singular forms (mo
vowel in one case),   i in the plural forms:

pressions ‘mine’, 'your' etc. and in ordinal expressions.    Its form is wi for masculine ref-
erents ti   for feminine, both in the singular and the plural:

                                                                                      base    ay

is unknown, etc.”     This pronoun base combines with the three demonstrative suffixes:

ing and form they are clearly demonstrative.   Roughly they express movement toward - d_         -
or away from - n - the speaker, or the subject or the verb.      Syntactically, these particles are
subject to the same conditioning as complement pronouns (see below) and both are

4.5.3       Kinship NounsThis category of nouns, which includes most nouns designating blood relative members    of the
immediate family, are particular both by the fact, already noted, that they do not bear gender
marks,          and by the syntax of complementation.                 The pronoun forms used with them                     (see 3.5.38}
are - with the exception of the first singular for which no pronoun is usually used (i.e, ‘fa-
ther' = 'my father') - essentially those indirect pronouns used with basic prepositions. The plu-
ral pronouns, however, are peculiar in that a t is introduced between the noun and the comple-
ment pronoun:                   illi                                 'my daughter’                   illi-s                               ‘your (m) daughter""                   illi-t-san                           ""their daughter'Further, kinship nouns may not receive a noun complement                                 without    being       accompanied,    redun-
dantly, by the appropriate third person pronoun:                   illi-s     uryaz-ad                  'this       man's     daughter'
RemarkIn Ayt Ndhir         Tamazight,      two kinship nouns,         bba         ‘'(my) father’    and    mma            '(my) mother’,   have
come to take the regular possessive pronoun series with n ‘of': e.g.      bba-nns    'his/her fa-
ther'.** Nonetheless, they continue to behave syntactically as kinship nouns both in not usually
laf anything,       there is a tendency to prefer this construction when pejorative meaning is intended.",[71]

This appears clearly to be a case of assimilation and, apparently, a result of      grammatical
  tense consonant detensing which results, in accordance with the phonotactic rules    stated a-
  bove, in no schwa   (8)  being placed before the tt and therefore contact being made between
  t, and     tt.     This is corroborated by the fact that the                                     t prefix is maintained                if it is before       a

2.4       STRESSIn Tamazight there appears to be no lexical stress,   i.e. stress is not part of the make-up of
a lexical item but rather arises in syntactic groups.   The only general statement that can  be
made is that stress is maintained quite equally in syllables with the end of the word receiving
rather more stress than the beginning.","[16, 17]"
"In ail cases, shwa is short, ultra-short when it is not the only vowel of the word and is between
consonants having the same voice characteristics.   Roughly, three main phonetic      realizations
should be noted here.  They characterize a moderate rate of speech.",[100]

nate sentence is operative.   With the exception of clauses introduced by «lahoqq      ‘because’,
all subordinate sentences with conjunction are characterized by satellite fronting and the obliga-

fy the two as the same element however:                  i-terbatin                 ur       da       assent                ttekksan                  azzar           yas        i-borra

4.7.2     Clefting”
A cleft sentence is one in which a phrase other than the verb phrase is made into the predi-
cate.  In English, this is the case for sentences such as 'It is John who did the damage’  as
opposed to ‘John did the damage’.","[79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"
"* For Tamazight,           it would be correct to say that the affixes                i ----       (singular)   and   ---- in (ple
 ral) are added to the third person plural form of the verb.    For other Berber languages, how-
 ever, it is clear that this is not how the participle was formed historically: in several Berber
 languages the suffixes are subject to being moved to preverbal position under conditions       of
 negation, much like verb satellites (see below Syntax 4.2) and in Tuareg may even be separ-
 ated from the verb form, when moved forward, by one or another of the satellite          comple~
 ments.   Tuareg distinguishes three participial forms, the singular participle agreeing in gen-
 der    as    well:                                         SINGULAR                                PLURAL

other nouns in the possessive pronouns used with them and in the syntax of genitival construc~
tions of which they are the head.®
The following       discussion        will restrict           itself to the morphology          of Berber (or berberized)                    com-
mon nouns.",[18]

that it is preferred when the noun phrase is indefinite, i.e. in a context where, for instance,
one is looking for 'a big man' to help in some matter but one doesn't have a particular man in
mind,     the   subject       relative        construction               will     be    preferred.","[73, 74, 75, 76]"

 identity sentences made up of two noun phrases juxtaposed without link.",[67]
"3In     Ayt     Ndhir      Tamazight,                quite     a few        borrowed         words     are    regularly    pronounced      with      lax stops
     [k,g,a].   Those borrowed words which are pronounced with [b, t, d], and to a certain
     degree [t],.often have a second equally or more acceptable pronunciation with[ 8, 6,5,8].

The word               /tamaziyt/,                        derived from the stem                        /maziy/                 'Berber',           is pronounced [6amazixé].
(c)   The contact of two lax articulations of the same point of articulation, across morpheme or
even word boundaries, results in the tense articulation of the same point, having the voice char-
acteristics of the second articulation (in accordance with (b) above).   The resulting tense articu-
lation is pharyngealized (emphatic) if either of the two contact phonemes is pharyngealized:

we will discuss below, notably with regard to rules for the formation of the construct state of
nouns.  ‘These rules distinguish between those nouns ~ a relatively small minority - whose first
vowel belongs to the stem    (asif,   iles,  t-addar-t,    t~-ixsi, etc.) and those, by far the
most numerous, whose first vowel belongs to the gender/number prefix (a-ryaz,       La-xam-t,
etc. )     and is dropped             -     contrary to the case of stem initial vowels - in the formation of the
construct     state,              ‘The hyphens         in noun forms will be used, hereafter, only in the  discus-

"     For a few verbs whose logical object is an indirect object (e.g. yers,     example (i) above) it is
     possible to have two indirect objects, the second being an indirect object of benefaction.   In the
     case of pronominalization of both indirect objects, the benefactive object pronoun is placed first:               ad~ax         iyers         umeyrus      i-tayatt

     and which include not only the presence of a verb particle but other conditions which we will de-
     scribe below - will be called, in this sketch,   satellite   fronting   conditions.      Certain
     satellite fronting conditions which remain to be described are also conditions under which cer~-
     tain other morpho-syntactic rules are to be observed, namely:               1)   the extensive particle                   la        becomes         da,               2)   the particles            ar      and     ad         may not be used,               3)   the projective aspect is expressed by the extensive stem of the verb,                                         with-
                     out particle (i.e. not, as elsewhere,by ad    + unmarked stem),     The conditions under which these rules apply ~ and under which satellites are fronted - will be
     called, for lack of a better word, dependency     conditions,     The following create depen-
     dency conditions:               1)   use        of negative        particle        ur               2)     relative      clause        construction               3)     cleft sentences             (essentially         relative      construction)               4)     questions,          of the non-yes/no variety     4.3      NEGATION     The     negative         particle    is placed        before         the verb      form   and   dependency     conditions,   described above,

"3.9.2.1           Action         NounsVirtually all verbs have a corresponding noun which is used in certain constructions,     with or
without complements, to designate the action or process expressed elsewhere by the verb ina
personal form.    Action nouns are highly irregular in their formation, i.e. often not predictable
from the verb stem, and many have to be simply learned with the verb from which they were
formed - or with which they were borrowed.      They may be masculine or feminine, with any of

0.2    BERBER     LANGUAGES/DIALECTSThere is no current definition of the terms ‘language’ and ‘dialect' which permits one to make
a clear distinction between these two terms with regard to Berber.            Different authors have pre-
ferred one or the other without, it seems, any rigorous notion of dividing line.             Estimates of
the number of varieties of Berber range from several hundred to 'some four or’ five thousand
different parlers',        the latter being the judgement of the late André Basset, the most impor-
tant and most reliable of Berber scholars to date.         With the possible exception of the Tuareg
dialects, which seem to be more distant from the rest of Berber than any other Berber dialect
is from other non-Tuareg dialects, one may only speak of more or less resemblance in some
given respect - phonology, lexicon, syntax, morphology.           Nonetheless, terms are used to des-
ignate larger groupings of Berber dialects, the most useful ones being those which refer to the
language of a large, continuous area of Berber speakers.           The most current and most        widely
used are Tamazight,            for the language of the Middle Atlas Mountains and eastern half of the
High Atlas Mountains in Morocco (also sometimes referred to as Beraber                  or Taberbrit),
Tachelhit        and/or   Tasusit      for the dialects of the High Atlas and the Anti-Atlas Mountains
in southern Morocco and the Sous Valley,           Tarifit    for dialects in the Rif Mountains     in the
north of Moroceo,       Kabyle     for the dialects of Kabylia, near Algiers and Bougie        in Algeria,
Chawia       for the dialects of the Awras Mountains south of Constantine in Algeria. Tuareg is
used for Tuareg dialects though | three main subdivisions are often distinguished:           Tamahaq,
Tamajaq,        and Tamashaq.*           None of these terms should be construed as indicating any -
thing like unity of the dialects of the group, though in general there is a higher degree of mu -
tual intelligibility within the group than between any dialect of the group and a dialect of an-
other group.",[7]
"Unberberized       loan nouns         are almost all characterized                  by the presence            of the Arabic definite ar-
ticle   - an    inseparable      part     of the borrowed             noun     in Berber,     which    marks      definiteness otherwise,
This article is phonologically                  /1/      usually,      but is manifested           - in accordance with Arabic mor-
pho-phonological        rules     - as        the reinforcement          of the    stem     initial consonant          if the latter is what
we might call a tongue~blade articulation, i.e. /t,d,t,d,8,8,2,8,%2,0,T1, r/        -and, of
course,  /1/. Loan nouns are generally borrowed with their Arabic plural form, formed in ac-
cordance with Arabic grammar,’   and, further,                                are not subject      to marking          for    state.    Their gen-
der is largely unmarked, i.e. must be learned                                with the noun.",[18]
"    16 This is true only for masculine nouns since feminine nouns, in Ayt Ndhir Tamazight, are   in-
       troduced in the noun complement and numeral constructions by the preposition n '‘of' (which,
       however, is followed by a noun in the construct state).

3.2         NOUN-ADJECTIVESThere is a sub-class of nouns which, as we stated above, is indistinguishable morphologically
from other nouns but must be distinguished on syntactic grounds (see Syntax).  They agree   in
number and gender with the noun modified but do not agree in state.   When used as nouns, they
are however, subject to state marking.     ‘             ‘Whereas noun~adjectives follow the noun modified, there are at least two noun ‘modifiers which
precede the noun and are invariable: ku   ‘each’ and  gar   'bad'.  These two morphemes thus
form a syntactic class apart.","[25, 26, 27]"

     Remark
BS
=    In Tamazight, as in many if not.all Berber languages, the indirect object is often announced by
     a satellite pronoun even if the indirect object noun appears in the sentence. This phenomenon is
     particularly characteristic of those verbs which occur very frequently with an indirect object of
     benefaction,   Thus:               ad-asen              isoy          bba       uééi           i-iSirran

0.1    GEOGRAPHICAL         DISTRIBUTIONBerber languages and/or dialects are spoken all across North Africa, from Siwa in Egypt to the
Atiantic coast; from Senegal and the Niger in the south to the Mediterranean.   The areain which
Berber is spoken is, not continuous but is broken up into islands surrounded by Arabic speaking
populations.   These islands are of greater or lesser size, sometimes they are but a single pop-
ulation center ~ village or oasis.  The accompanying map shows the distribution of Berber.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"
"'Northern'            Berber
Destaing        (19.)     offers       a good   description       of     the      grammar       of    a   '‘northern'     dialect       in         Morocco      as
well    as     a multitude         of useful     comparisons            with      other      Berber       languages,      particularly              in his treat-
ment     of the        pronoun.         His   Beni    Snous     study         (15.)    offers   grammar         and     texts    and,        ina    companion
volume (16.), a dictionary which includes entries from a number                                                     of other East Algerian and
West Moroccan dialects.    Renisio (29.) provides data from several                                                 Tarifit dialects and a rather
good     vocabulary.            Further       east,   Chawia      syntax          is   the   subject      of   my     study     (28.}   providing        numer-~
ous examples, each with word to word translation, all drawn from Basset (6.),        a collection of
texts with faithful translation and abundant, mostly morphological,   notes, Béguinot's   study of a
Nefusa (Libya) dialect (8.) provides grammar,     texts and a short lexicon.

General       Works,         Cross     Dialect    StudiesGeneral       works     on    Berber      are    few   and     far    between.         Basset's    overview       of Berber     (3.) contains   an
admirable sum of knowledge and scholarship but is of such density and gives so few examples
that it should be attempted, by the non-specialist, only after a thorough familiarization with one
or several dialect grammars.      His study of the verb (4.) provides comparative data fora great
number of Berber languages / dialects.      Destaing provides data from many dialects in his works
dealing with classification on the basis of one particularly typical ciass of verbs (17.),   demon-
strative forms (18.), persotial pronouns (19., chapter II) and, to some extent,     vocabulary (19.,
pp. LXXVI-LXXXIII of introductory Notice).","[123, 124]"
"Verbs of the type ccc (kd@m ‘'work') have the                    same vowels as those above but the middle rad-

‘painter,   dyer’.
Many subjective nouns are formed with a prefix vowel a                        and      m       or     n   before      the verb    stem.
Most often another vowel is inserted or changed as well:              ssnoy                  _   ‘mount!                        amesnay                 'rider'              aseoy                      ‘transport’                    amasay                  ‘porter’              azon                       ‘send'                         amazan                  'messenger'              ddukkeal                   taccompany'                    amddakkul               ‘companion!              zday                       ‘camp!                         amozday                 ‘camper'              ks                         ‘graze!                        amoksa                  ‘shepherd'              soy                        ""buy'                          amsay                   ‘buyer’              zwar                       'precede'                      amezwaru                ‘first’

*7 In fact, historically,           it is more likely that the perfect stem of the verb was originally                       a     nominal
  form    (cf. Diakonoff (20) ).

ject of the object sentence may be identical or different.   If different, however, it must be

"Berber, or berberized, common nouns are characterized clearly by gender and number marks
(prefixes, suffixes, infixes; see below) such that one can, with rare exception, identify them as
to gender and number without knowing either the meaning or other forms of the noun in ques~
tion: nouns with initial vowel are masculine almost without exception, those with initial t are,
without exception, feminine.    Morphologically, noun-adjectives, a class of words distinguishable
on syntactic grounds, are identical to common nouns.      All Berber common nouns are subject to
marking of 'state' (see below).",[18]
