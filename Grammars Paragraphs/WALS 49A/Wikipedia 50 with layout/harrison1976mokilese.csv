"89. Kama John pirin raunla.
    ‘John and I are going to go for a stroll.’The dual pronoun kama ‘we two (exclusive)’ is used in 89,
where once again only two people are involved, the speaker and
John. This differs markedly from the English usage, where the
pronoun would refer to the people involved, minus the person
or people referred to by the noun.
    The remote plural pronouns appear to be used very little in
Mokilese. In most cases, they may be replaced by the corres-
ponding plural pronouns. The remote pronouns refer to groups
of people, usually large, and most of which are probably not di-
rectly present when being discussed. Thus, kihs ‘we’ refers to
the speaker, the hearer, and a large group of people not present
at the time of the conversation. Similarly, kimi ‘we’ refers to the
speaker and to a group of others not present; kimwi ‘you’, to
the hearer and others not present, and ihr ‘they’ to a group of
people not present.
   Since kihs, for example, commonly refers to very large
groups of people, it is often used to refer to all the people of
Mokil or to the whole human race.",[113]

               1.1 SOUND AND SPELLING
It is important not to confuse speech sounds with writing.
Writing is a way of representing language on paper. It allows
us to communicate ideas and descriptions of events to people
in places and at times far removed from the places and times
where these ideas originated. Thus, it is possible for a person
on Mokil to read about events that took place in Honolulu or in
Washington and to find out about the ideas of people who lived
many hundreds of years ago.
    Although writing represents language, it does not neces-
sarily represent the sounds of language. For example, in the
case of the Chinese writing system that uses symbols to rep-
resent whole words, a Chinese will be able to look at a character
and pronounce the word it represents, but he will not be able to
say that any part of the character stands for a specific sound of
that word.
    Most of the world’s languages use alphabetic writing
systems. (The name comes from the first two letters of the
Greek alphabet—alpha and beta.) In such systems, the symbols
used are meant to represent sounds. For example, in the English
word cat, most of us would agree that there are three sounds
which are represented by the three letters c-a-t. In fact, pho-
neticians (people who study speech sounds) tell us that speech
is actually a more or less continuous stream of sound, so that it
is often very difficult to tell where one sound ends and the next
begins. If this is true, it is not surprising that sounds can be af-
fected by the sounds surrounding them, as we shall see below.",[32]
"78. Jeriho peik a jeriho pel mine ah johjo.
    ‘That child is respectful and that child will get his
    inheritance.’79a.Jeriho peik.
    ‘That child is respectful.’     Jeriho pel mine ah johjo.
b.
     ‘That child will get his inheritance.’Because both sentences 79a and 79b discuss the same person,
represented by the noun phrase jeriho ‘that child’, they may be
combined in a relative clause construction. That is, sentence
79a may be treated as an attribute of the noun phrase jeriho
‘that child’ in 79b, since it describes one of the child’s qualities
(in this case, the fact that he is respectful). However, if we try
to combine the two sentences as:80 *Jeriho ma jeriho peik pel mine ah johjo.the result is not a grammatical sentence. It is normal for a
second occurrence of a noun phrase (in this case, the noun
phrase jeriho ‘that child’ in ma jeriho peik ‘that that child is
respectful’) to be replaced by the corresponding pronoun (see
3.4). If we pronominalize the second occurrence of jeriho ‘that
child’ in 80, the result is the grammatical sentence:80. Jeriho ma ih peik pel mine ah johjo.
    ‘The child who is respectful will get his inheritance.’in which the noun phrase jeriho has been replaced by the
pronoun ih ‘he’ in the relative clause.

82. Woallo ma John pokihla ih mine nehn imwen wini.
    ‘The man that John beat up is in the hospital.’83. Jeripeinno ma ngoah suhoang ih aio mihn Pohnpeimen.
    ‘The girl that I met yesterday is a Ponapean.’84. Ngoah jeuweje woallo ma ih kioang ngoahi mwinge.
    ‘I helped the man who brought me food.’In sentence 82, the pronoun ih in the relative clause ma John
pokihla ih ‘that John beat him up’ refers to the preceding noun
phrase woallo ‘that man’. Similarly, ih in example 83 refers to
jeripeinno ‘that girl’ and ih in example 84 refers to woallo ‘that
man’.
   Note also, however, that these pronouns may be freely
deleted from the relative clauses in which they occur. Thus, ex-
ample 75 above is equivalent to example 81 with the pronoun ih
deleted. Similarly, examples 82–84 may be rendered:85. Woallo ma John pokihla mine nehn imwen wini.
    ‘The man that John beat up is in the hospital.’86. Jeripeinno ma ngoah suhoang aio mihn Pohnpeimen.
    ‘The girl I met yesterday is a Ponapean.’87. Ngoah jeuweje woallo ma kioang ngoahi mwinge.
    ‘I helped the man who gave me food.’
     10.4.3 Possessive Constructions in Relative Clauses
There is one case in which a pronoun within a relative clause
may not be deleted, even though it refers to the noun phrase
of which the relative clause is an attribute. These are cases in
which the element in question is the possessor in a possessive
construction within a relative clause. Consider:88.Jemen woallo koapwoahpwoa, a noai jeripeinno painki
   woallo.
   ‘The father of that man is rich, and my daughter married
   that man.’Since both occurrences of woallo ‘that man’ in example 88 refer
to the same person, it is possible to change

man’ in:89b.    Noai jeripeinno paink i woallo.
        ‘My daughter married that man.’Without pronominalizing woallo in 89a, the result is the strange
sentence:90.Noai jeripeinno painki woallo ma jemen woallo

                0.2.1 The Position of Mokilese
It should be obvious that the more a language resembles one’s
native language (in using similar words to name the same ob-
jects or actions, in constructing sentences in similar ways, and
so forth) the easier that language will be to learn. We may think
of languages as being somewhat like members of a family. The
more closely related they are, the more likely they are to re-
semble one another. More distant relatives, whether languages
or people, resemble each other less. Just as people from dif-
ferent families often bear almost no resemblance to one an-
other, unrelated languages will tend to use very different words,
sentence types, and so on.
    The parallel between language groups and family groups
does not end here, however. Just as we can say that two people
are related through a common ancestor, it is possible to say
that two languages are related in this way. To illustrate this,
let us assume that half the people in one village on one island
move to another island a few hundred miles away. At the time
of the migration, all the people of the village, both those who
leave and those who stay, speak the same language. Languages
do not remain the same however; they are constantly changing.
Young people may not speak exactly the same way their grand-
parents do. They may use a few different words, or pronounce                               xxi
                          Introduction
the same words in a slightly different way. We can assume that
this would happen in the two mythical communities we have
been discussing, both in the case of those who migrated to the
new island and those who stayed behind. There is no guarantee,
however, that the same changes would occur in both places.
Over the years, perhaps many hundreds of years, change would
follow change until the languages of the two communities, origi-
nally the same, had become so different as to be called different
languages. In this way we might think of a parent language
(the language of the original community before the migration)
changing into two daughter languages. The parallel between
people and languages fails at this point, however. Parents give
birth to children, so that both parents and children can be alive
at the same time. Parent languages change into daughter lan-
guages, so that both parent and daughters cannot exist in the
same place at the same time (except where the parent language
is artificially preserved, as is true of Latin).
    This process of language change is a continuous one. Two
daughter languages may themselves change, each into two
more languages, so that the original parent language has de-
veloped into four languages. These languages might be said
to belong to the same LANGUAGE FAMILY because they have a
common ancestor, namely, the language spoken in the original
community. To describe this kind of situation, we might use the
diagram in figure 1. We call such a diagram a family tree di-
agram. The term tree is appropriate because the original lan-
guage has branched into new languages just as trees become
taller and wider by adding new branches. Each line (or branch)
in the diagram represents a series of changes that has led to the
development of a new language.","[22, 23]"

                    Introduction            0.1 THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE
Language can be defined in many ways. Most people tend to
think of language as a tool; one we use to communicate our
wishes and thoughts to other people. This view equates lan-
guage with talking, an external, social activity involving our-
selves and other people. What we often overlook is that lan-
guage is also a tool for thinking. In a real sense, we use
language to communicate internally with ourselves, to frame
ideas, make plans, and consider problems. Whenever we think,
dream, worry, or engage in any other mental activity we use
words and we make sentences, although these are words and
sentences that we alone “hear” without ever having to speak
them.
    As a social instrument, language is more than a means of
communication. It is also a symbol of identity, a way of setting
off one’s own group from other groups. At the simplest level,
young people often use slang words not used by adults. The
use of these words sets off the young as a social group. On
Ponape, for example, the use of high language helps define
social groups. On an even larger scale, is it not to a great extent
the fact that one speaks Mokilese that makes one a Mokilese?
In this sense, language helps define ethnic and national groups.
    The study of language is important for all these reasons.
First, because language is a tool of communication, the study of
language is to some degree the study of how we communicate,
and may aid us in learning how to communicate more effec-
tively. Second, because language is tied closely to all thought
processes, the study of language is important in understanding
the structure of thought and perhaps ultimately the structure of
the human mind. Third, one studies his own language to learn
to what extent it shapes, and is shaped by, the society in which
he lives. Pride in one’s language and a desire to preserve it and
to understand its workings should follow directly from pride in
oneself and in one’s community.

                          Introduction
                         0.1.1 Grammar
There are also a number of ways to define the word “grammar.”
It is, first, a set of rules and observations about a language and,
second, a book in which these rules and observations are set
down. In referring to language the word rule has two senses
that have led to two very different conceptions of the purpose
of a grammar. Some people take the term rule of grammar to
mean a rule about how a language should be spoken. For ex-
ample, it is a rule of the grammar of English, in this sense, that
one should not use the word ain’t or that one should say “He
and I went fishing” rather than “Him and me went fishing.” This
kind of grammar has been called PRESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR because
it seeks to prescribe (direct, order) how language should be
used. (Terms printed in small capital letters are defined in Ap-
pendix B.)
    The second sense of the notion rule of grammar derives from
the observation that languages do not use words and sounds
randomly, but follow set patterns. Thus, in Mokilese, the word
wa ‘the’ must always follow the word to which it refers: (woalwa
‘the man’ not *wa woal). Also, whenever the word wa follows
a word that ends in p or m, the w of wa changes to p or m.
Thus, poappa ‘the board’ (not *poapwa) and damma ‘the out-
rigger’ (not *damwa). (In this grammar, ungrammatical struc-
tures will be preceded by an asterisk (*).) These are rules of the
grammar of Mokilese in the sense that they describe the pat-
terns that words and sentences must follow in Mokilese. This
kind of grammar has been called DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR because
it seeks to describe how a language actually is used by those
who speak it, rather than to set down laws concerning how a
certain individual, or group, feels the language should be used.
    This grammar attempts to be descriptive of Mokilese, a set
of observations about how Mokilese is used and spoken by the
speakers of Mokilese who gave so much of their time to teach
me about their language. At no time does it claim to be a set of
rules about how Mokilese should be spoken. In this grammar,
when we speak of a grammatical sentence or a grammatical
structure in Mokilese, we are talking about something that the
Mokilese people might say in the proper circumstances. Con-
versely, an ungrammatical sentence or structure is one that is
not correct Mokilese, because it is not a sentence or structure
that any Mokilese himself would ever use. Thus, example 1a is a

1a. Woal sihkeio poaloahdi sukhoahu
    man strong-that chop-down tree-that
    ‘The strong man chopped down the tree.’ b. *Sihkei woallo poaldi suhkoahu. 2(An English sentence such as *‘The man strong was chopped the
tree.’ captures the flavor of the Mokilese sentence 1b.)
    It might be wise to caution the reader at this point that it is
often difficult to judge the grammaticality of structures in a lan-
guage. Some people might allow certain structures that others
consider totally ungrammatical, while a third group might be
undecided. This is perhaps true of an English sentences such as:2. There’s a man come to see you.","[17, 18, 19, 20]"

donesian—show striking resemblances in the form of these
words, while the corresponding English words are very dif-
ferent. This leads us to conclude that English is not a member
of the Austronesian family.
    The exact nature of the relationships among languages in
the Austronesian family is not clear. Figure 3 gives a simplified,
and perhaps a not entirely correct, picture of what these rela-
tionships might be. Only more detailed comparison of all the
languages concerned will give us a clearer picture.

Figure 3: Austronesian Languages                     0.3 BORROWING
Contact between peoples often leads to changes in language.
The most obvious of such changes is the adoption of new words
borrowed from other languages. Mokilese has borrowed large
numbers of words from the languages of foreigners who have
come to Micronesia, as well as from other Micronesian lan-
guages. The two earliest European rulers of Micronesia—the
Spanish and the Germans—left very few words in Mokilese.
Some that were borrowed from Spanish are pwohla ‘ball’ and
mihsa ‘mass’. The only words that seem to have been borrowed
from German are dois ‘Germany’ and mahk ‘mark, German
money’. In contrast, however, there are many hundreds of
words of Japanese and English origin that have found their way
into Mokilese.","[25, 26]"

                  1 The Phonology of Mokilese
Even though speech is continuous, it is still convenient for us
to try to cut up the stream of speech sounds into segments, a
segment being what most of us would agree is a single sound.
    Even alphabetic systems do not always represent sounds ac-
curately or consistently. In English, for example, the same sym-
bols are often used to represent very different sounds, as in the
case of the ou in thought, though and through. The same is true
in Mokilese, where e is used to represent different sounds in
ngenin ‘his spirit’ and jed ‘sea water’. 1 A string of symbols is
often used to represent what is phonetically a single sound. This
is true in the case of the th 2 in the English words thought and
though mentioned above and in Mokilese in the case of the ng
in ngen, which is phonetically the single sound [ŋ].
    As is probably very obvious by now, we will often find it nec-
essary to represent speech sounds more accurately than the
writing system does. For this purpose we will use PHONETIC
SYMBOLS. Phonetic TRANSCRIPTION (as this phonetic representa-
tion is called) will always be enclosed in square brackets [ ] to
distinguish it from ORTHOGRAPHY (as the normal spelling system
is called), which will always be in italics. Thus, ngen [ŋɛn]
‘spirit’.","[32, 33]"

                         PrefaceThis first attempt toward a grammar of Mokilese is bound to be
a disappointment to all. It is intended to be a grammar that will
be useful to native speakers of Mokilese, both as a stimulus to-
wards the development of interest in the study of the Mokilese
language, and as an introduction to the study of language in
general. The grammar’s second aim is to provide information on
Mokilese for the linguist. I have tried to steer a middle course
between these two audiences and I fear that in doing so I have
failed to satisfy either. It is my hope that the present work
will be succeeded by other efforts in both the educational and
the purely linguistic spheres. Errors of fact, of analysis, and of
design present in the following pages can then be corrected.
    The research summarized here was carried out between Oc-
tober 1971 and December 1973 at the Pacific and Asian Lin-
guistics Institute (PALI) of the University of Hawaii. During June
and July of 1973 I was able to work on Mokil. Of the many
people who struggled valiantly to teach me Mokilese, I must
give special thanks to Salich Albert, Aruwo David, Aira Edmond,
Galen Joel, Lidy Poll, and Damien Sohl. Thanks also to Thomas
H. Roberts for allowing me to use the Mokilese data he collected
during 1970 and 1971, and to Donald M. Topping, the then di-
rector of the PALI, who gave me invaluable help and advice at
every stage of my work. My special thanks go to the clerical
staff of the PALI for suffering through numerous revisions of
early drafts, and to the Linguistics Department of Monash Uni-
versity, Melbourne, for its cooperation in the preparation of the
final typescript. Lastly, I must not fail to acknowledge the con-
tribution of my wife Nicole, who not only typed the bulk of the
final manuscript, but also proved to be an excellent linguistic
fieldworker whose suggestions, drawn from her attempts to use
the grammar as an aid in learning Mokilese, were of great value
throughout.

3.3 REFERENCE: DETERMINERS AND PRONOUNS
As we have said before, most nouns refer to classes of people
or objects. A noun like li ‘woman’ identifies a group of people
having certain characteristics, and a noun like suhkoa ‘plant’, a
group of objects with a different set of characteristics. Because
the number of people or objects to which a certain noun, like li
or suhkoa, might refer is so large, it is necessary to have some
way to restrict its reference. In this way, the noun will refer to
only a small number of all the possible objects to which it might
refer, or even to one particular object. A number of different
kinds of morphemes can be used to determine the reference 3
of a noun. One such set of morphemes are called DETERMINERS.
These include such suffixes as -e ‘this’, -o ‘that’, -kai ‘these’, -pwi
‘some’ and -wa ‘the’. Determiners serve to point out the location
of the object(s) being discussed or to tell us whether the object
is one with which we should be familiar. The form and function
of determiners in Mokilese will be discussed in sections 3.3.2 to
3.3.6.
   PRONOUNS (3.4), unlike determiners, do not help to de-
termine the reference of nouns. Rather, as has already been
suggested above, they take the place of nouns whose identity
and reference should be clear to the hearer. The form and
function of Mokilese pronouns will be discussed in section 3.4.",[93]

                     Appendix AWRITTEN MOKILESE
               A.1 STANDARD SPELLING
Mokilese is used very little for writing. Most of the written ma-
terial available to the Mokilese is either Ponapean or English,
so that there are no models to follow for writing Mokilese.
As a result, most Mokilese use either Ponapean or English for
writing. If they use Mokilese, it is usually heavily influenced by
Ponapean. It is hoped that the appearance of this Mokilese Ref-
erence Grammar and the Mokilese Dictionary will lead to more
extensive use of Mokilese as a written language.
    A standard spelling system is a set of rules and conventions
for writing a language. The existence of such a system provides
a ready answer to the question, “How should I write this
word?”. For languages with a standard spelling system, one
need only consult a dictionary to find out how a given word
should be spelled. Standard spelling systems usually do not
arise overnight, however. To become established, such a system
requires that it be accepted by speakers of the language and,
most important, that it be used by them.
    Mokilese lacks the written tradition that has given rise to
most standard spelling systems for the world’s languages and
consequently, lacks a standard spelling system. For this reason,
we have had to make some essentially arbitrary decisions con-
cerning the spelling system used in this Grammar and the Mok-
ilese Dictionary. Such decisions had to be made for the sake
of consistency. While they are based, I feel, on sound scientific
principles, they are not intended to provide a firm and final
statement of how Mokilese is to be written. This can be done
only by the Mokilese people themselves, as they use their lan-
guage. What we have tried to do here is simply to provide a
starting point.","[377, 378]"

                 Mokilese Reference Grammar
The term personal pronoun is not meant to suggest that such
pronouns refer only to people. Although this is in fact their most
common use, they can also refer to animals and to inanimate
objects.86a.   Doahkko koahdi John.
       ‘That dog bit John.’  b.   Ih koahdi John.
       ‘It bit John.’87a.   Joauo joah mwomwen koalik.
       ‘The sun doesn’t seem large.’  b.   Ih joah mwomwen koalikjang jampah.
       ‘It doesn’t seem larger than the earth.’In 86b, the pronoun ih ‘it’ refers to the noun phrase doahkko
‘that dog’ of 86a; in 87b the same pronoun is used to refer to
the noun phrase joauo ‘the sun’ of 87a.
    The term personal derives from the fact that these pro-
nouns are grouped according to persons (see 3.3.2.3). That is,
we speak of pronouns as being first person if they refer to
the speaker, as second person if they refer to the hearer but
not the speaker, and as third person if they refer to neither
the speaker nor the hearer. This corresponds to the division
of demonstratives into speaker-oriented, hearer-oriented, and
third-person-oriented.","[111, 112]"

                  6.4.2 Adjectives and Verbs
In many languages active verbs can be distinguished from
stative verbs by giving the latter the label adjective and re-
stricting the label verb to the former (with some excep-
tions—statives like ‘to exist’ and ‘to know’ would be considered
verbs in English, for example). The adjective-verb distinction
does not seem particularly important in Mokilese, for the fol-
lowing reasons:
    (i) Languages with an adjective class usually require that an
adjective used predicatively be accompanied by a copula verb
like English ‘to be’. Mokilese stative verbs require no copula
when used predicatively. Compare:48a.      Ngoah johmwehu aio.
          ‘I was sick yesterday.’  b.      Ngoah doadoahk aio.
          ‘I worked yesterday.’In English, the adjective ‘sick’ in 48a can be distinguished from
the verb ‘to work’ in 48b by the presence of was (a form of the
copula ‘to be’). In Mokilese, the stative verb johmwehu ‘sick’
and the active verb doadoahk ‘to work’ are not distinguished.
   (ii) In Mokilese, active verbs can often appear as noun
phrase attributes. Active verbs cannot usually be used in this
way in English.49a.   Liho noaisikdi 1 aio.
       ‘That woman gave birth yesterday.’  b.   Li noaisikko johmwehuda.
       ‘The woman who gave birth got sick.’   (iii) English often has pairs of words, one a verb and the
other an adjective, where Mokilese has only a single stative
verb.50a.          Ngoah mijik ih.
              ‘I fear him.’  b.          Ngoah mijik.
              ‘I am afraid.’
                                149
             6 Predicates, Verbs, and Verb Phrases
    (iv) In Mokilese, any stative can be preceded by INTENSI
FIERS (see 7.1.5) like inenin ‘very’, while in English, only adjec-
tives (never verbs) can take ‘very’. For example:51a.   Ih inenin roairoai.
       ‘He is very tall.’  b.   Ih inenin kidal poap.
       ‘He knows how to swim very well.’
                 not
       *‘He very knows how to swim’In 51b, English does not allow ‘very’ to modify the verb ‘to
know’ directly. Mokilese has no such restriction.
    For reasons like these, it does not appear necessary to dis-
tinguish between adjectives and verbs in Mokilese. All can be
considered verbs. When it becomes important to make a dis-
tinction of this kind, the terms active and stative (as defined
above) can be used. This distinction appears to be truer to
the facts of Mokilese grammar than is the distinction between
verbs and adjectives.","[179, 180, 181]"
"6. In this and the following derivation, V is meant to represent
   an old historical transitive suffix removed by Final Vowel
   Deletion. In such cases, transitive verbs (related to intran-
   sitive verbs or nouns) preserve final vowels where these
   vowels have been lost in the related intransitive or nominal
   forms.",[414]
"
                  5.2.3 Stem Formant Analysis
The third possible treatment of the possessive forms is a com-
promise between the previous two. In it, the root would be given
(morphophonemics aside) the same form as that of the free form
(as in the uniform root analysis) while the suffixes would be
analyzed so as to have as few different forms as possible (as
in the uniform suffix analysis). A form like oadoaioa ‘my name’
would be analyzed as oad+oa + ioa, in which oad- is the root
‘name’, -ioa is the suffix ‘my’, and -oa- is a special stem formant
vowel (see 2.1.2.4) that must be inserted between the root and
a possessive suffix.
    This analysis is not without its problems, however. First, it
is not clear whether to treat a form like oadoa ‘his name’ as
oad+oa +ø, with a zero third person singular possessive suffix,
or as oad+oa, with no stem formant vowel and -oa as the third
person singular possessive suffix. Second, in most cases we
must know for each noun root which stem formant vowel to use
(for example, -oa- in the case of oad- ‘name’, but -e- in the case
of moang- ‘head’), since the identity of the stem formant vowel
is not fully predictable. In this respect, this analysis seems to
have little advantage over the uniform suffix analysis discussed
above.
    The analysis we adopt here is basically the uniform suffix
analysis. (At some points, deviations from this analysis will be
suggested.) This analysis seems to correspond closely to the
history of Mokilese. At one time, most Mokilese words that now
                               114
                 Mokilese Reference Grammar
end in consonants ended in vowels. We know this was the case
by comparing Mokilese with other Micronesian (and Oceanic)
languages that still have these vowels. A word like ad ‘name’
was at one time probably *ada. (The asterisk here indicates a
form that does not exist but might have at one time.) These old
final vowels are now preserved in the possessive forms. Thus
oadoaioa ‘my name’ was probably originally *ada + i (to which
the suffix -oa was later added). While the final /a/ in forms like
*ada was removed by a process called final vowel deletion, the
same vowel /a/ remained in a form like *ada + i because there it
was not final. For example:                    *ada*ada+i
Final Vowel Deletion ad ———
                     ad *ada + i (later oadoai, then oadoaioa)Viewed in the light of the probable history of Mokilese, it is
therefore not surprising that a free form like ad ‘name’ should
appear as oadoa- in the possessive paradigm.
   The possessive suffixes are given in the following table, ac-
companied by a brief review of some of their more important
characteristics.","[145, 146]"
"
        4.1.8 Indefinite Articles and the Number ‘One’
The full forms of the number ‘one’ appear after nouns only in
cases of special emphasis. For example, woal emen ‘one man
not two’. The number ‘one’ is more often represented by the nu-
meral classifier alone, appearing as a suffix to the noun:woalmen            ‘one man’
woal emenwarpas             ‘one canoe’
war apaspukkoaw            ‘one book’
puk ewNote that the number ‘one’ in the general counting system is
never used without the numeral prefix. It is always either -ew or
-oaw.
   As noted in 3.3.2.1, the suffixed forms of the number ‘one’
are also used as INDEFINITE DETERMINERS.",[130]

    Languages can be shown to be related (in the sense de-
scribed above) to the extent that they resemble one another.
The fact that most of the languages of Micronesia are related is
obvious if we compare words in those languages. For example:             Mokilese   Ponapean   Kusaiean       Trukese   Marshallese   Gilbertese

‘forehead’   soamwe     —          motonsro       chaamw    daḿ           ramwa
These and many other words are very similar in all the lan-
guages that we call Micronesian, while the English words with
the same meaning are very different. From this we can conclude
that all the Micronesian languages are related (belong to the
same language family), while English is not related to the Mi-
cronesian languages, but belongs to a different language family.
    Within the Micronesian family some languages seem to be
more closely related than others. It is obvious that Mokilese
and Pingelapese are very closely related, since a speaker of one
language can understand the other language with no difficulty.
Both Pingelapese and Mokilese are closely related to Ponapean.
Beyond this, however, it is difficult to say which Micronesian
languages are more closely related to which others. The family
tree shown in figure 2 gives a rather simplified picture of the
Micronesian language family, with special attention given to
those Micronesian languages most closely related to Mokilese.
    When we compare words in Micronesian languages with
words from other languages in the Pacific, it becomes clear
that Micronesian languages belong to an even larger family
containing many hundreds of languages. This family has been
called Austronesian and includes Polynesian languages (like                                          xxiii

Hawaiian, Samoan, and the languages of Nukuoro and Kapinga-

New Hebrides, to the south of Micronesia; the languages of the
Philippine Islands, a few languages spoken on Taiwan, the lan-
guages of Indonesia and even of the island of Madagascar, off
the coast of Africa. (This last large group of languages has been
called Indonesian and includes Palauan and Chamorro, both of
which are spoken within what is geographically Micronesia.)

common Austronesian words in languages as far apart as Mok-
ilese, Hawaiian, and Indonesian.","[23, 24, 25]"

              10.6.9 Questions as Complements
When a question is used as a complement, as after verbs of
mental state or verbal activity, the complement is introduced by
pwa. For example:204.Ngoah kidal pwa inje kadardo kijakijjo.
    ‘I know who sent that present.’205.Kama jong pwa ia loalin pillappo.
    ‘We measured how deep the river is.’206.Ngoah jehjoa pwa amwda koah ke nimen ngoan jeuweje
    koawoa.
    ‘I don’t know why you want me to help you.’

             11 Word Formation            11.1 WORDS AND MORPHEMES
In chapter 2 we stressed that words are not the smallest units
that can have meaning, and that even words can have parts.
A word such as kemwehui ‘to improve’ has three parts—the
causative prefix ke-, the root mwehu ‘good’ and the transitive
suffix -i. One of these parts, mwehu ‘good’‚ is itself an inde-
pendent word that can appear alone. The other two are affixes,
which must always be attached to some root. To all such mean-
ingful units, whether they are independent words or affixes, we
give the term MORPHEME. Thus, ke-, mwehu, and -i are all mor-
phemes.
   The study of word formation involves two closely related
topics: the study of how morphemes combine to make words;
that is, the internal structure of words; and the study of how
words can change to make new words; that is, the relation-
ships between words.
    As described in chapter 2, there are two basic components
of a word—the ROOT (the heart of the word) and AFFIXES, which
modify the meaning of the root. A word can consist of a root
alone, with no affixes, as in the case of the word mwehu ‘good’‚
or of a root with a number of affixes, as in the case of a word
like kemwehuiekla ‘to become improved’, which consists of the
root mwehu ‘good’ and the affixes ke- ‘causative’, -i ‘transitive’,
-ek ‘intransitive’, and -la ‘perfective’.
    Affixes can be divided into a number of different types, out-
lined in chapter 2. For our purposes here we may consider three
affix types—PREFIXES like ke-, that precede the root; SUFFIXES
like -i, that follow the root, and REDUPLICATION, as in poadpoadok
‘to be planting’ (from poadoak ‘to plant’) or pikapik ‘sandy’
(from pik ‘sand’), that repeats part of the root.
    We cannot study the relationships between words without
also studying the internal structure of words, because the
changes that words undergo in making new words usually in-
volve some kind of affixation. From the word sohrohr ‘different’
we can derive the word aksohrohr ‘to show independence’ by                               298
                  Mokilese Reference Grammar
means of the prefix ak, and from this word we can derive liak-
sohrohr ‘uncooperative’ by means of the prefix li-. However, all
relationships between words do not involve affixation. For ex-
ample, a word like kodkod ‘to husk’, which is normally a verb,
can be used as a noun in a sentence such as example 1, with no
change in form: 11. Ah kodkoddo inenin pispis.
   ‘That husking of his was done very fast.’
       11.2 FUNCTIONS OF WORD-BUILDING
                  PROCESSES
The study of word formation is the study of complex or altered
words. These words are complex either because they consist of
more than one morpheme or because they are being used in un-
usual, untypical ways (as in the case of kodkod ‘to husk’ above).
Many of the processes we will be discussing here have already
been treated in detail in other sections of the grammar; for ex-
ample, the formation of transitive and intransitive verbs. These
processes will be referred to here only as examples of word
building processes, without repeating those details of their
syntax and semantics that have been treated elsewhere.
   Complex words might be created for a number of different
reasons:a.to express obligatory categories. For example: i) kinship terms must be possessed        joamoai          ‘my father’
        pahioa           ‘his wife’
        riasa            ‘our brother’ ii)numbers used with nouns must contain a classifier        roahmen          ‘two animates’
        jilpas           ‘three long objects’
        pahw             ‘four ordinary things’b.to change the meaning of the root. For example:                              299
                       11 Word Formation
    the prefix ja- creates a new word with a meaning nearly
    opposite that of the root        sihkei           ‘strong’
        jasihkei         ‘weak’c.to signal grammatical functions, for example, transitive and
  intransitive verb suffixesd.to signal semantic functions, for example, the suffix -ki
  marking the following noun phrase as an instrumente.to change the word class of a root, for example, to permit a
  verb to function as a noun
     11.3 PRODUCTIVITY OF WORD-BUILDING
                 PROCESSES
A productive word-building process is one that can be use
freely to derive new words. This is not to say that any word in
Mokilese can be made to undergo such processes. Only words
belonging to the class to which that process applies can nor-
mally be made to undergo it. An example is the causative prefix
ka-, which is added to stative verbs (occasionally, but rarely,
to active intransitive verbs) to allow the cause of that state to
be expressed. Causativization (as we might call the causative
verb-building process) is productive in Mokilese because it can
apply to any stative verb.
    A nonproductive word-building process is one that is re-
stricted to only a few items of the class of words to which it ap-
plies. An example is the negative prefix ja-, which also affects
stative verbs. Unlike the causative ka-, the negative ja- cannot
be added to all statives. We can say kalelpoak ‘to make sure’
(from lelpoak ‘dependable’) and jalelpoak ‘undependable’, and
kamijik ‘frightening’ (from mijik ‘to be afraid’) but not *jamijik.","[328, 329, 330, 331]"
"51.   Wahdoahng ngoahi kehs pokonno.
      ‘Bring me the full case.’
            4.3 THE LIMITING SUFFIX -OAR
When used in a noun phrase, the suffix -oar can be translated as
‘only’ or, in some instances, ‘same’. It can be suffixed directly to
a noun, number, determiner, or other noun phrase attribute.",[137]

                     12 Sentence Processes
    In sentences were the basic word order is VERB + OBJECT it
is perhaps correct to say that these sentences have no subject,
since the subject, as defined above, must precede the verb.
In the case of sentences where the order of basic elements is
variable (e.g. VERB + OBJECT or OBJECT + VERB), we can say that
these sentences only have subjects when the verb is not the
first major element. I would like to claim that in such cases, the
order VERB + OBJECT is the basic order and that the order OBJECT
+ VERB is the result of a rule of subject formation, which
moves noun phrases into subject (pre-verbal) position. Let us
first examine a few clear cases of the operation of this rule.","[360, 361]"
"
                   10.3 COORDINATION
It is possible to combine sentences 9a and 9b into 9c because
both John in 9a and Tom in 9b stand in the same relation to the
verb indoa ‘came’. They are both NP subjects.9a.     John indoa.
        ‘John came.’ b.     Tom indoa.
        ‘Tom came.’ c.     John apel Tom indoa.
        ‘John and Tom came.’The process of joining constructions of the same type and
function is called COORDINATION. Thus, 9c is an example of the
coordination of noun phrase subjects. It may be diagrammed:
    The noun phrase subject of 9c has two parts, NP2 and NP3,
both of which are noun phrases. The parts of a coordinate con-
struction like NP1 are said to be conjoined, and the morpheme
that joins them (in this case apel ‘and, in addition’) is called a
coordinate conjunction.
   Any two constructions of the same type and function can be
conjoined.",[291]

     0.3.3 Borrowings from Other Micronesian Languages
Because the people of Mokil have lived in close contact with
Ponapeans, Marshallese, Pingelapese, and Kusaieans for so
many years, it seems obvious that words from the languages
spoken by these people must have entered Mokilese. Since
all these languages are closely related they tend to resemble
one another rather closely, so that it is often difficult to rec-
ognize words in Mokilese borrowed from other Micronesian lan-
guages. Some cases are clear, however. For example, words
like indan ‘popular’, pohnkahke ‘lazy’, rahnmwahu ‘greetings’,
and wahn poaroan ‘minister’ have been borrowed from Pon-
apean. It would appear that words like moado ‘skilled navigator’
and mej ‘exhausted’ are Marshallese in origin. It is likely that
the word doa ‘sugarcane’ was borrowed from Kusaiean. There
are undoubtedly many more Mokilese words borrowed from the
                                 xxix
                          Introduction
other languages of Micronesia, but it is difficult to tell exactly
how many because of the problems in distinguishing such bor-
rowings from native Mokilese words.

   1 The Phonology of MokileseLanguage is primarily sound; or, more precisely, sound pro-
duced by the human speech organs and arranged in a manner
that is meaningful to a listener who speaks the same language.
Is is not one of the main tasks of this grammar to describe how
speech sounds are produced; but, in order to understand the
Mokilese sound system, we will give some attention to articul-
atory phonetics, the study of the production of speech sounds.","[30, 31, 32]"

                     3 Nouns and Reference
      3.4.1.2 NUMBER IN PERSONAL PRONOUNS
Personal pronouns, except the first person inclusive, have four
numbers: singular, referring to only one person; dual, re-
ferring to two persons; plural, referring to more than two
persons; and remote plural (see below).
    It is interesting to note that in a noun phrase consisting
of both a pronoun and a noun, the pronoun refers to the total
number of people involved in the event, including the person (or
people) being referred to by the noun. For example:88.   Kamwa Davy inla duhdu.
      ‘You and Davy went swimming.’In example 88, the dual pronoun kamwa ‘you two’ is used where
a total of two people is involved, the hearer and Davy.","[112, 113]"
"23.   Johnpadahkko pel doaksoahmen.
      ‘The teacher is also a doctor.’24.   Me ruhlpas.
      ‘This is a ruler.’
                  3.3.2 Nouns with Determiners                     3.3.2.1 NONGENERIC
Just as a generic noun refers to an entire class of objects, a
non-generic noun refers to a particular member or members of
a class, rather than to the class as a whole. Most nongeneric
nouns are marked with a determiner of some kind. As was sug-
gested in 3.3.1.4, the nonemphatic forms of the number ‘one’ (-
ew, -oaw, -men, -pas, and -kij—see 4.1.8) can be used in this way.
Examples are:25. Ioar pukkoaw me pohn sehpille.
    ‘There’s a book here on the table.’26. Japalahkkoaw pirin wiawi rehnnoawe.
    ‘A trip will be made today.’27. Enihmen pwen mine nehn rosso.
    ‘A demon was waiting in that dark place.’

                     3 Nouns and Reference
28. Ih koahkoahkoaulki koaulpas.
    ‘He kept on singing a song.’In sentences 25 to 28, one instance of the classes of objects rep-
resented by the nouns puk, japalahk, eni, and koaul is being dis-
cussed, rather than the whole class. It is also possible to discuss
more than one member of a class without discussing the whole
class. In English, the distinction between one member of a class
and more than one (called SINGULAR ‘one’ and PLURAL ‘more than
one’) is made by adding a suffix (usually -s) to a noun, or by oth-
erwise changing the form of that noun. For example:Singular           Plural
one book           five books
one girl           five girls
one man            five men
one foot           two feetIn Mokilese, the distinction between singular and plural is
usually expressed by a change in the form of the determiner.
The determiners discussed above (-ew, -men, -pas, and -kij) all
have the same plural form -pwi. This suffix is perhaps best
translated by the English word ‘some’.","[96, 97]"

   5.7 NOUN PHRASES OF CHARACTERIZATION
At the beginning of this chapter, we defined three kinds of pos-
sessive relation: ownership, part-whole, and kinship. In the
following noun phrases we see constructions that are formally
identical with the kinds of possessive constructions we have
been discussing so far but which do not seem to represent any
of the three relations just mentioned. For example:doahkin keikei ‘biting dog’
woalin nim piha ‘bear drinking man’
doakoahn mahn ‘deserted island’ (literally—island of
                animals)
puken wadwad ‘reading book’
anjoaun jikeng ‘test time’
mahnin          ‘wildlife of Mokil’
Mwoakilloa
jidohsahn Japahn‘Japanese car’    Noun phrases such as these can be called noun phrases
of characterization. They express such relations as purpose
(puken wadwad ‘book for reading’), content (kokonin juke ‘box
of sugar’), origin or location, (jidohsahn Japahn ‘Japanese car’,
mahnin Mwoakilloa ‘wildlife of Mokil’), and behavior or char-
acteristics (doahkin keikei ‘biting dog’, woalin nim piha, ‘beer
drinking man’).
   Noun phrases of characterization consist of a noun in the
construct form followed by either another noun:winihn kihdo           ‘medicine for
                       ringworm’
doadoahkin li          ‘woman’s work’
oarloapin pukko        ‘topic of the book’
johnpadahkin           ‘history teacher’
   poadpoad
wanihmwin umwwo        ‘the door of the
                       house’or an intransitive verb (see Section 6.5):
                               133
                     5 Possessive Constructions
sohpin kamwakel           ‘cleaning soap’
doahkin jilajil           ‘guard dog’
waren joaroak             ‘sailing canoe’
pinjelin insing           ‘writing pencil’
anjoaun alu               ‘time to go’
  5.7.1 Construct Suffix in Noun Phrases of Characterization
As pointed out in section 5.3.3.1, the i-stem class is the pro-
ductive class of inalienable nouns. It is not surprising, therefore,
that most nouns that are not inalienably possessed (do not have
a possessive paradigm) but do have a construct form take the
construct form -in, since this is the productive (see section 11.3)
form of the suffix. In such cases the -in construct is often treated
as a separate word, rather than as a suffix. For example:woalin nim piha       ‘beer-drinking man’
               or
woal in nim piha      ‘beer-drinking man’When the noun to which -in is suffixed ends in a vowel or glide,
this contrast is clear. For example:anjoaun jikeng         ‘test time’
                or
anjoau in jikeng       ‘test time’
wijahn doadoahk        ‘place for working’
                or
wija in doadoahk       ‘place for working’In the case of nouns ending in a glide, the suffixed construct is
-n, rather than -in. The same is true of nouns ending in a vowel,
except that the vowel is lengthened before suffixing -n. In either
case, it appears that the construct marker can also appear as
the independent word in. When the construct marker appears
as an independent word, it is called the construct particle. It
is possible, in cases such as these, that the suffixed construct
particle contracts before the preceding noun, similar to English
contractions such as ‘it’s’ (from ‘it is’).
    In addition to in, there appears to be a second construct par-
ticle en. Like in, it can be used both as an independent word and
as suffix. For example:                                134
                 Mokilese Reference Grammar
puken wadwad             ‘reading book’
                   or
puk en wadwad            ‘reading book’
war en joaroak           ‘sailing canoe’
                   or
war en joaroak           ‘sailing canoe’The en construct is typically used to indicate the use to which an
object is put. The two examples above might be translated ‘book
for reading’ and ‘canoe for sailing’. This construct is perhaps
related to the benefactive function of possessive classifiers that
was discussed in 5.4.2. This relation is more obvious when the
‘possessor’ in a construction with en is a noun than it is in the
two cases above, in which en was followed by intransitive verbs.rais en Mwoakilloa      or en Mwoakilloa rais   ‘rice for Mokil’
raujij en Japahn        or en Japahn raujij     ‘pants for Japan’    Note, however, that not all constructions indicating the use
of an object require en. For example, imwen kuk ‘cook house’,
but umwin suhkoa ‘house for keeping wood’. I have no expla-
nation for these forms. The use of en in constructs of use is a
tendency, not a rule; -in may be used instead under as yet unde-
termined conditions.
   Just as en might be related to a possessive classifier, it is
possible that in is related to the locative particle in (see 8.4).
Consider:a. pwilin moaio
   ‘The sap of the breadfruit tree’b. pwillo in moaio
   ‘The sap in the breadfruit tree’The in of b) is the locative in. Note that the noun preceding the
locative in can take a determiner. Now consider the ungrammat-
icality of25.   *Umwwok in Kolonia suhkoa.where the determiner -ok ‘those’ is not permitted. While the
meaning of the in construct is often related to location, it is not
clear that it is the same morpheme as the locative particle in.","[163, 164, 165, 166]"
"
             5.3 POSSESSIVE PARADIGMS                   5.3.1 Third Person Singular
The third person singular possessive forms are those that show
the most variation. It is thus possible to classify different
possessive paradigms according to the form of the third person
singular. They fall into two basic types, those whose third sin-
gular ends in -n (for example, kilin ‘his skin’ or kijehn ‘his
relative’) and those whose third singular ends in a vowel (for ex-
ample, oadoa ‘his name’, moange ‘his head’, jamah ‘his father’).
The first type can be termed n-third singular nouns and the
second vowel-third singular nouns.
   Within each of these major types a number of subtypes can
be distinguished according to the stem vowels of the third sin-
gular (and, in some cases, the construct form). These varieties
are summarized below:Vowel-third Singular-oa stems
-oa, -a stems
-e stems
-ah stems
-ooa stems
long vowel stemsn-Third Singular-i stems
long vowel stems    Each of these varieties will be discussed in turn in the sec-
tions that follow. In each case, a sample paradigm will be given,
followed by a list of nouns that follow this paradigm, and a
number of explanatory notes. The listed nouns are given in
their third singular forms and free forms (if these exist). Unless
                               116
                  Mokilese Reference Grammar
otherwise indicated, loosely-inalienable nouns will be marked
(L). Nouns not specified as loosely-inalienable (either by (L) or
in an explanatory note) are normally tightly-inalienable.","[147, 148]"

                  Mokilese Reference Grammar
    It is sometimes very difficult to separate the descriptive and
result functions of this nominalization type. In sentence 6, for
example, the nominalization lallalin oawoa ‘the speaking of his
mouth’ might refer to what he says or to the way he says it. Sim-
ilarly, pokpokin jeriho in example 7 might be translated ‘the way
that child was beaten’ or, simply, ‘the beating of that child’. In
example 10, poadin suhkoahu seems to refer only to the result
of the activity ‘planting’; that is, to the planted tree. But in ex-
ample 11, we see kurujekin mwehnggo referring to either ‘the
grounds’, the physical result of the activity of grinding, or to the
way in which the grinding was done.
    The intransitive root used in forming these nominalizations
is usually reduplicated, when used to describe an event, unless
the intransitive is formed by suffixing -ek or the intransitive root
has two syllables.
    Noneventive nominals are not normally reduplicated. Thus,
corresponding to the essentially eventive nominal lallalin ‘the
way he talks’ we find the noneventive lalin ‘language of’.
Similarly, corresponding to the eventive kodkodin ‘husking of’
we find the noneventive kodin ‘husking stick for…. Some verbs
seem to have only noneventive nominals; for example, poadin
‘planting of’. Nominalizations of stative verbs are normally non-
eventive and, therefore, unreduplicated; for example, dak in
‘brightness of’. The distinction between nominals that describe
events (eventive nominals) and those that describe objects, re-
sults, or conditions (noneventive nominals) seems to be an im-
portant one but is as yet poorly understood.
    The possessor noun phrase in a descriptive or result
nominalization usually represents the person or object towards
which the activity is directed. However, particularly in the case
of active intransitive verbs, it may also refer to the agent. For
example:12. Rahrahuin liho kadiroapwoa ngoahi.could be translated either:13a. ‘The way that woman screamed bothered me.’ or
  b. ‘The screaming about that woman bothered me.’

                         11 Word Formation
An agentive interpretation of such nominalizations formed from
transitive verbs is allowed by some speakers, but others insist
that such an interpretation is impossible. These latter speakers
will not accept a sentence like:14. ?Kodkodin woallo kapwuriamwei.
    ‘The way that man is husking is surprising.’
     11.5.3.3 DESCRIPTIVE NOMINALS OF PERFECTIVE
                        VERBS
Descriptive nominals are regularly formed from intransitive per-
fective verbs by adding the suffixes -koa ‘third person singular’
or -koan ‘construct’. For example:15. Dakdakoan joauo inenin ling.
    ‘The sunrise is very pretty.’16. Ioar doahr koajoandikoan ah lallal.
    ‘That was the basis of what he said.’17. Ngoah pel inenin pwuriamweikihla pwa inoangpase nauna
    imwlakoa.
    ‘I too was very surprised that the story ended badly.’18a.Pwurlakoan wijahn.
    ‘The other side of that spot.’      Pwurdokoan wijahn.
b.
      ‘This side of that spot.’   Descriptive nominals of perfective verbs are often used in
exclamations as:19.     Soaplakoan woallo!
        ‘The size of the man!’20.     Soausoaulakoan sakaio!
        ‘How heavy that rock is!’21.     Kijoulakoan jerim weinno!
        ‘The way that boy runs!’                                  306
                  Mokilese Reference Grammar
   n-third singular (see 5.3.3) nominals can also be formed
from perfective verbs, particularly in the case of result
nominalizations.22a.    Ohlahn wanihmwwo koalik.
        ‘The break in the door is big.’  b.    Ohlakoan wanihmwwo koalik.
        ‘The break in the door is big.’
11.5.3.4 DESCRIPTIVE NOMINALS OF STATIVE VERBS
n-third singular nominals are freely created from stative verbs,
as, for example:dirin        ‘amount of’         (from dir ‘many’)
woaroain     ‘duration of’       (from woaroai ‘to last’)
mwehuin      ‘goodness of’       (from mwehu ‘good’)
roairoain    ‘length of’         (from roairoai ‘long’)
loalin       ‘depth of’          (from loal ‘deep’)
apwalin      ‘difficulty of’     (from apwal ‘difficult’)   These nominalizations are of particular interest because
they frequently combine with the suffix -oar in a comparative
construction similar to the English ‘as … as’ construction.","[335, 336, 337, 338]"

woalmen         ‘a man’

pinjelpas       ‘a pencil’
anjoaukij       ‘some time’
                   4.1.9 Position of Numbers
Numbers usually follow the nouns to which they refer:armaj pahmen       ‘four people’
jiloa rahpas       ‘two axes’
wus ijuw           ‘seven bananas’   The indefinite determiners are suffixes that are loosely-
bound (see 2.1.2.1) to the words to which they are attached:kasmen             ‘a cat’
pukkoaw            ‘a book’
pinjelpas          ‘a pencil’Other numbers are independent words.
    Within the noun phrase, numbers normally follow other at-
tributes, but precede determiners:ni koalik rahpasso
‘those two large coconut trees’anjoau mwehukije
‘this good time’pwohla pwuhsuhssoaw
‘a round ball’This kind of internal noun phrase structure may be dia-
grammed:
                                100
                 Mokilese Reference Grammar
The number may precede other attributes, but in this case its
meaning is somewhat different. Compare:a.   jeri siksik roahmenno
     ‘those two small boys’b.   jeri roahmen siksikko
     ‘those two small boys’The noun phrase b) appears to single out two boys from a group
who are all small. It seems, then, that moving a number from its
usual position to one closer to the noun places special emphasis
on the number.
   The words ew, emen, apas ‘one’, ekij ‘a bit, a little, some’
and epwi ‘a few’ can precede a noun. When that noun has no
determiner, the words mean ‘another’ or ‘other’. For example:13. Kihdoahng ngoahi ew puk.
    ‘Give me another book.’14. Ih wahdo epwi puk sohrohr.
    ‘He brought some different books.’15. Joah isar pil ipoai; ih pirin wahdo ekij pil.
    ‘I don’t have enough water; he’ll bring some more.’  When a determiner appears in these constructions, the
meaning is somewhat different.","[130, 131, 132]"

The simplest kind of possessive sentences resemble existential
sentences very closely. Consider:99.      Mine koanoai m wehng.
         ‘I have taro.’100.     Mine nah koaroahmen.
         ‘He has a koaroa.’101.     Mine woaroan woallo war.
         ‘That man has a canoe.’                               222

       ‘That woman has a new skirt.’103.   Mine rioai jerimwein.
       ‘I have brothers.’104.   Mine nihn woallo jeri.
       ‘That man has children.’105.   Pe minehr noai pukkok.
       ‘I still have those books.’    A possessive sentence of this type has three basic elements:
the verb mine (or some other existential verb), a possessive
noun phrase identifying the possessor, and a noun phrase iden-
tifying the thing possessed. The restrictions on the position and
definiteness of this last element are the same as those on the
topic of an existential sentence. The structure of simple pos-
sessive sentences like 99 and 104 might be diagrammed:

       8.6.2.1 POSSESSOR SUBJECT SENTENCES
When the possessor in a simple possessive sentence is repre-
sented by a noun (rather than a possessive suffix, pronoun,
etc.), it may appear in subject position (see 12.2) at the be-
ginning of the sentence. For example:106.    Woallo mine war ah war.
        ‘That man has a canoe.’107.    Liho mine ah wurohj kapwwoaw.
        ‘That woman has a new skirt.’108.    John mine ah raujij.
        ‘John has pants.’109.    Jerimweinno mine nah pwohla.
        ‘That boy has a ball.’These sentences are related to:110.    Mine woaroan woallo war.
        ‘That man has a canoe.’111.    Mine en liho wurohj kapwwoaw.
        ‘That woman has a new skirt.’112.    Mine en John raujij.
        ‘John has pants.’

113.     Mine nihn jerimweinno pwohla.
         ‘That boy has a ball.’Sentences 106–109 differ from 110–113 in that where the latter
have possessive phrases consisting of the construct form of a
possessive classifier plus a noun phrase, the former have a third
person form of the possessive classifier. That is, woaroan woallo
‘that man’s vehicle’ in 110 corresponds to warah ‘his vehicle’ in
106. In the possessor subject sentences 106–109, the noun indi-
cating the possessor appears at the beginning of the sentence,
rather than within the possessive noun phrase. The structure of
possessor subject sentences can be diagrammed:

                      2.2.1 The Sentence
First, we will consider whether there is anything in language
that can be called the unit of communication. It is easy to
show that this unit is not the same as the unit of meaning—the
MORPHEME that was discussed in section 2.1. Using morphemes
(or even words) in isolation is not equivalent to communicating.
Communication involves thoughts and ideas that are much more
complex than elementary units of meaning.
   For example, consider a relatively simple situation that we
might want to describe through language. Let us suppose we
are on the beach, and we see an old man out on the reef fishing.
To describe what we see, we must use a number of units of
meaning (morphemes) such as the following: woal ‘man’, loakjid                               53
                 2 Words and Meaningful Units
‘to fish’, wos ‘reef’‚ -o ‘that’, lap ‘old’, and pohn ‘on’. It is not
enough to list the morphemes in some random order, however.
Communication requires some organization of the meaningful
units. For example, it is the man who is old, so that the mor-
phemes woal ‘man’ and lap ‘old’ must be closely associated. One
means of expressing such association of meaning is to place the
morphemes in question near one another; thus, woal lap.
    Similarly, it is the old man that we are pointing at on the
reef. We signal this kind of pointing by the morpheme -o ‘that’.
Grouping these three morphemes together we produce the con-
struction 4 woal lappo ‘that old man’. The order of morphemes
within a construction is normally fixed. We cannot say *lappo
woal or *o woal lap. The orders lap woallo and woallo lap might
be possible, but with a different meaning (‘That man is old’
rather than ‘that old man’).
   We can form another construction from pohn ‘on’, wos ‘reef’
and -o ‘that’ since these three morphemes together tell where
the old man was fishing—not under the reef, nor inside it, but
on the reef. The order of these elements is also fixed. We must
say pohn wos so, not *wosso pohn.
    From the six morphemes with which we began, we now have
three units: the constructions woal lappo and pohn wosso and
the word loakjid. These, too, must be combined in a specific
way; we must say woal lappo loakjid pohn wosso ‘that old man is
fishing on the reef’ rather than *woal lappo pohn wosso loakjid.
     We have described in some detail one way in which the
process of organizing morphemes into a unit that can be used
to communicate information can be viewed. What we produced
was the sentence: Woal lappo loakjid pohn wosso. ‘That old man
is fishing on the reef.’ We may, therefore, consider the SENTENCE
to be the unit of communication that we set out to define. Since
the principal function of language is communication, it must be
able to produce such units of communication. A language may
then be viewed as a device that produces sentences.
    The internal structure that we assumed for the sentence
constructed in the preceding paragraphs may be diagrammed
as follows:
                                 54
                 Mokilese Reference Grammar
This type of diagram is called a tree diagram. It is made up
of lines (called branches) that join together those morphemes
that are most closely associated in a group of morphemes. The
point in a tree diagram at which these lines meet (labeled X in
the tree above) marks a construction of associated morphemes.
These constructions can themselves be joined together in a
larger construction (and these into still larger constructions and
so forth) by means of other branches. In the above tree di-
agram the topmost X marks the construction that we have been
calling a SENTENCE. Thus, the above tree tells us that the sen-
tence Woal lappo loakjid pohn wosso is a combination of the
units (constructions) woal lappo, loakjid, and pohn wosso.","[84, 85, 86]"

 1.8 CONSONANT CLUSTERS AND EXCRESCENT
                VOWELS
In section 1.7 we saw that the process of vowel reduction
can produce consonant clusters. For example, the cluster lk in
moalkoahla ‘to forget’ is derived by reducing the syllable luk
in molukluk ‘forgetful’. We also noted cases like armaj ‘human’
[arɨmac], where the consonant cluster rm has been broken up
by an excrescent vowel.
    As was suggested in that same section, certain consonant
clusters do not arise through vowel reduction. This is, of course,
true for clusters in loanwords; for example, jilper ‘silver’ and
dengwa ‘telephone’—the former an English loanword, the latter
a Japanese. Words such as these entered the Mokilese vocab-
ulary with consonant clusters that existed in their language of
origin. In a Mokilese word like moalkoahla, we know that the lk
cluster arose through vowel reduction because we can compare
this word with the related word molukluk. For other words, for
example, adroau ‘egg’ and armaj ‘human’, there are no related
words with a vowel separating the two consonants. Unless such
related words exist, we have no way of knowing if these con-
sonant clusters arose through vowel reduction (as in the case                                  29
                  1 The Phonology of Mokilese
of moal koahla) or not. When we cannot be sure whether vowel
reduction has operated, it is perhaps safest to assume that the
basic form of the word in question contains a consonant cluster.
    Consonant clusters that arise through vowel reduction and
consonant clusters that exist in the basic form of the word,
before any rules have applied, are both examples of morpheme-
internal consonant clusters. (For a discussion of the concept
MORPHEME, see section 2.1.) That is, both consonants in the
cluster belong to the same morpheme. This is not always the
case, however. In the following examples the two consonants in
each cluster belong to different morphemes.apwalki    ‘to find        from      ‘difficult’ + ki ‘with’
           difficult’,     apwal
weijla     ‘to pull out’,  from weij ‘to pull’ + la ‘away’
akpwung ‘to self-justify’, from ak- ‘display’ + pwung ‘correct’
limwijmwij ‘slippery’,     from      ‘to slip’ + Final
                           limwij    Reduplication
loangloang‘full of flies’. from      ‘fly’
                           loangAs the last two examples show, clusters that are the result of
the process of REDUPLICATION (see section 2.1.5) are treated as
morpheme boundary clusters.
     Consonant clusters are often broken up by the insertion of a
vowel, usually [ɨ]. Such a vowel is called an EXCRESCENT VOWEL.
Excrescent vowel insertion is a complex process because in
some circumstances it must take place, while in others it must
not, and in still others an excrescent vowel may or may not be
inserted. For example, an excrescent vowel can never be in-
serted in kodda ‘to run aground’, nor in pumpum ‘to kick feet’.
It is normal in cases like soapla ‘huge’ [sɔpɨla], however. In ex-
amples like minmin ‘clean’, lipilpil ‘watery’‚ and onopda ‘ready’,
the insertion of an excrescent vowel is optional.
    An excrescent vowel is never inserted between identical
consonants, as in kodda above. Clusters consisting of a nasal
(/m/, /m/, /ŋ/, /mw/) and a stop, a liquid (/l/, /r/) and a stop, or
a fricative (/s/) and a stop are not broken up by an excrescent
vowel when the two consonants have the same point of articu-
lation. Therefore, no excrescent vowel is inserted in mwindi ‘to
sit down’, pumpum ‘to kick feet’, lolda ‘to become wet’, or rosda                                30
                 Mokilese Reference Grammar
‘to become dark’. Clusters of a stop followed by a liquid are
usually broken up: pwedla ‘lucky’ [pwɛtɨla], pakrikrik ‘to coax’
[pakɨrikɨrik].
    We have only mentioned a few of the possible consonant
cluster types in Mokilese. In the cases we have not
mentioned—stop-stop, nasal-nasal; and nasal-stop, liquid-stop,
or fricative-stop clusters, where the two consonants have dif-
ferent points of articulation—excrescent vowel insertion ap-
pears to be optional.
   Consonant clusters tend to be favored (that is, not broken
up) under the following general conditions:   a. when followed by a sequence of a high and a non-high
   vowel
             aksuahu       ‘dissent’          [aksuwaaw]
             akjuei        ‘to boast’         [akcuwey]
compare      akmwahl       ‘to disdain’       [ak(ɨ)mwaal]
             akmai         ‘to argue’         [ak(ɨ)may]                         b. in longer words
           wedmalan        ‘watermelon’           [wɛtmalan]
           dikjeneri       ‘dictionary’           [tikceneri]
           moalkoahla      ‘to forget’            [m?lkɔɔla]
compare    dakno           ‘to surf’              [takɨno]
           jikjik          ‘to make a wake’       [cikɨcik]    In general, the more segments that follow a cluster, the
less likely an excrescent vowel is to arise. In addition to these
factors and those mentioned earlier in the discussion, there
is some evidence that clusters are also favored under the fol-
lowing conditions:                   c. when a long vowel follows
            doakdoahr ‘kind of fish’                  [tɔktɔɔr]
    compare dakdak    ‘to meat out a coconut’         [takɨtak]
but compare engdehng ‘to hurry’                       [ɛŋɨtɛɛŋ]             d. when the cluster is morpheme-internal
                               31
                  1 The Phonology of Mokilese
        wedmalan ‘watermelon’                        [wɛtmalan]
compare dakno    ‘to surf’, lit. ‘to ride wave’      [takɨno]We do not yet know enough about Mokilese consonant clusters
to draw any conclusions from these facts.
    Mokilese has borrowed many foreign words (particularly
from English) that contain consonant clusters. Unlike Mokilese,
English allows a consonant cluster to begin a word; for example,
flour, glass, blue. In the Mokilese versions of these words, the
initial clusters are broken up. Instead of inserting an [ɨ],
however, a high front vowel [i] is normally inserted. (A high back
round vowel [u] is inserted when the following vowel is round.)pilawa    ‘bread’                [pilawa]
kilahs    ‘glass, mirror’        [kilaas]
puluh     ‘blue’                 [puluu]Speakers of Mokilese who are familiar with English tend to
reduce these vowels somewhat. Many such speakers will not
insert a vowel at all, but will pronounce the clusters much as
they are in English. Word internal clusters in foreign words
are treated in the same way as Mokilese clusters; eprel ‘April’
[ɛpɨrɛl].","[60, 61, 62, 63]"
"Of course, it is possible that, in many cases, the related forms
mentioned in i) have not yet been identified. Also, it is very dif-
ficult to determine whether speakers of a language consider two
words to be related. These problems have led to many inconsis-
tencies in the treatment of reduced vowels.
   Even if both conditions i) and ii) hold, a reduced vowel is
usually not written if it has been obliterated entirely. Thus, re-
duced vowels are written in:kurujek ‘to grind’, from kuruj ‘to grind something’
kanara ‘their (two) food’, related to kanah ‘his food’but not in:                               354
                           Appendix A
maldek ‘to unfold’, from malad ‘to unfold something’
moalkoahla ‘to forget’, related to molukluk ‘forgetful’where the vowels in question have been obliterated.
    This system is far from satisfactory and many inconsis-
tencies regrettably remain. Any modifications must await
further research.","[385, 386]"
"     It is not always clear which processes are to be considered
derivational and which inflectional. Some criteria have been
proposed to separate the two, but none are foolproof. We must
still depend on the judgment of speakers of the language as
to how to treat a given process. Unfortunately, as so often
happens, in many cases the judgment of the native speaker is
not clear. It has been proposed that derivational processes are:a.   those that change word class membership. Yet, for
     example, the suffix ja- added to a stative verb creates what
     most of us would consider to be a different word without
     changing the word class: mum ‘tasty’, jamum ‘not tasty’.b.   those that are not productive. Yet, most people would
     consider the rather productive process of adding -ki ‘with’
     to a noun to create a verb meaning ‘to use as …’ to be
     derivational; for example ama ‘hammer’, amahki ‘to use as
     a hammer’.",[332]
"9. Eniho kanah okidekdahwehr ara kanah kipdihoar pakid
   nehn moange.
   ‘The demon then lay back there and they just started pulling
   the lice from his head.’10.Ara weirda inenin dir mwinge, doari ara ken idandihwe.
   ‘They gathered a large amount of food, then they carried it
   back down.’In this sense, -we can often be rendered by the English word
‘back’, which also seems to mark motion towards a location pre-
viously established in the story.
   As was pointed out earlier, it is common for a suffix from the
up-down set (-di, -da) to be used together with a suffix from the
participant-relation set (-do, -la, -we). In this case, the former
must precede the latter.",[240]
"
        5.4.2 Benefactive Use of Possessive Classifiers
The possessive classifiers are often used in constructions where
English would require the prepositions “for” or “to”. In such
sentences, the possessive classifier indicates the person who
benefits from the object (or action), rather than its owner.12a. Ngoah insingehdi kijinlikkoauoaw nihmw.
     ‘I wrote a letter to/for you.’  b. Ngoah insingehdi nihmw kijinlikkoauoaw.
     ‘I wrote a letter to/for you.’In this benefactive use, the possessive classifier can either
precede or follow the noun with which it occurs, though occa-
sionally with a change in meaning. For example:13a.   Ngoah dupukla woaroamw pohspas.
       ‘I bought a boat for you.’  b.   Ngoah dupukla pohspas woaroamw.
       ‘I bought a boat from you.’As yet, I have no explanation for the conditions under which this
change in meaning takes place.
    Other examples of the benefactive use of possessive classi-
fiers are:                              130
                   Mokilese Reference Grammar
14. Ngoah rapahki ih pwa ngoah kioang nah mwaniho.
    ‘I looked for him to give him the money.’15. Liho doadoa ah.
    ‘That woman sews for him.’
  5.5 MULTIPLE POSSESSIVE CONSTRUCTIONS
It is possible for a noun representing a possessed object in a
possessive construction, at the same time, to be the possessor
in another, larger possessive construction. In the English noun
phrase:16.      That man’s friend’s canoe.the noun ‘friend’ is the thing possessed in relation to the noun
‘man’ (the ‘possessor’), but is the possessor in relation to the
noun ‘canoe’. In other words, the English possessive con-
struction ‘that man’s friend’ is included within the larger pos-
sessive construction ‘that man’s friend’s canoe’.
      Similar constructions are possible in Mokilese. Consider:17.    Woaroan en woallo pirienno warro.
       ‘That man’s friend’s canoe.’In this case, however, because both of the possessive relation-
ships in question are considered alienable in Mokilese, pos-
sessive classifiers must be used. In example 2, the classifier en
‘thing of’ refers to the noun pirien ‘friend’ in the possessive
construction en woallo pirienno ‘that man’s friend’. The clas-
sifier woaroan ‘vehicle of’ refers to the noun war ‘canoe’. Thus,
the possessive construction en woallo pirienno is completely in-
cluded within the larger possessive construction woaroan en
woallo pirienno warro. This construction may be diagrammed:

  5.6 ATTRIBUTES OF INALIENABLY POSSESSED
                   NOUNS
Inalienably possessed nouns may take determiners, numerals,
suffixes like -oar ‘only’, and other attributes, if the meaning of
the noun permits.","[161, 162, 163]"

                   5 Possessive Constructions
                  5.2.2 Uniform Suffix Analysis
In this analysis, the division between the root and the pos-
sessive suffix would be made so that each suffix would have as
few different forms as possible. In the case of the paradigm for
ad ‘name’, the root would be oadoa- and the suffixes would be
-ioa ‘my’, -mwen ‘your’ -ø (zero) ‘his’, and -n ‘construct’, and so
forth. In this analysis, the possessive root (e.g., oadoa-) would
differ from the free form (in this case ad) in having an extra final
vowel. 6 However, this analysis has the advantage of reducing
the number of different forms of each suffix. It would require
only three forms of the third person singular suffix—ø (zero) in
forms like oadoa ‘his name’ and moange ‘his head’ -n in forms
like kilin ‘his skin’, and -a in forms like japwah ‘his land’ (japwa
+ a=japwah).","[144, 145]"

sitive verbs audo ‘to fill’, poadok ‘to plant’ and kohkoa ‘to grind’
in the a) sentences, but follow the noun objects in incorporated
object constructions in the b) sentences. Since these are verbal
suffixes, it appears that incorporated object constructions are
treated as ordinary verbs.

In the preceding sections we have discussed intransitive verbs
that involve one major participant, either the actor or agent
(in the case of active intransitives) or the person or object af-
fected (in the case of stative or result intransitives), and tran-
sitive verbs that involve two major participants, the actor (in
the case of active transitives) and the object towards which the
action or feeling is directed. In the sections that follow we shall

sider first the suffix -ki and, second, the causative prefix ka-. 15
                       6.6.1 The Suffix -ki
The suffix -ki functions in different ways depending on the kind
of verb with which it is used.

commonly used to permit an instrument to to be expressed. In
the following examples the instruments and the suffix -ki are
emphasized.","[195, 196, 197]"

ticle. The new information in the answer to such a da question
is an indefinite noun in all the examples I have noted.92a.     Dahkij pohn sehpillo?

makes an enquiry about the characteristics of some specific in-
definite noun, or it may be followed by nothing, in which case
it makes an enquiry about the characteristics of some class of

case it can be translated into English as ‘how?’ or ‘how much?’84.   Ia woahr dupukoa?
      ‘How much does it cost?’85.   Ia loalinnoar me?
      ‘How deep is it here?’86.   Ia uhen pil nehn rimehu?
      ‘How much water is in that bottle?’87.   Ia dirinnoar nihmw puk?
      ‘How many books do you have?’   In this sense, ia is used with expressions indicating extent,
such as woahr ‘same size as’, woaroain ‘extent of’, uhen
‘amount of’, dirin ‘number of, amount of’, and in expressions
containing the limiting suffix -oar ‘up to’.
    The third use of ia is in questions about the identity or char-
acteristics of a definite noun. In this case it can be translated
into English as ‘which?’88.    Ia pohsso koah mwehuki?
       ‘Which boat do you like?’89.    Ia oadoamwwen?
       ‘What is your name?’

Da is used in much the same way as the English word ‘what’. In
a sentence like:90. Da koah pirin wiahng suhkoahpaso?
    ‘What are you going to do with that tree?’it asks a question about an activity. The new information in the
answer to such a question is usually a verb that names an ac-

    ‘I walked to the reef.’81. Inenin soamwoan sakoal pohn madau rehnnoawe.

does not appear to be a corresponding noun *woal meaning
‘forest’.","[249, 250]"

remote pronouns themselves (see 3.4.1.2), are used infre-
quently. Many nouns seem to lack remote forms completely,
while with others there seems to be some doubt as to what the
correct remote forms should be. It is only in the case of the
possessive classifiers, some kinship terms, and some body parts
that there is little doubt as to the identity of these forms.",[143]

      3.4.1.4 PERSONAL PRONOUNS AND INANIMATE
                       NOUNS
Personal pronouns may be used to refer to inanimate nouns
(nouns that refer to things rather than persons or animals) only
if the pronoun is being used as the SUBJECT of a sentence.",[115]
"116.    Ngoah jamanki woallo.
        ‘I treat that man like a father.’117.    Ih waranki poappo.
        ‘He used that board as a vehicle.’118.    Ngoah nainki nah pinjelle rehnnoawe.
        ‘I am using his pencil today.’The -ki in -nki appears to be related to the associative suffix -ki
(see 6.6.1). As such, it seems to indicate that the ‘object’ noun
is related to the subject in some manner described by the verb;
for example, in sentence 116 ‘as a father’ and, in sentence 117,
‘as a vehicle’. Consider:119.      Ngoah pallanki John.
          ‘John is my opponent.’120.      Noai mahnno adanki ‘Joe’.
          ‘My bird is named ‘Joe’.’In 119, John is related to the speaker as an opponent. In 120,
‘Joe’ is related to the speaker’s bird as a name. Thus, these pos-
sessive verbs might better be termed associative verbs. Some
examples are:anki    ‘to have as a possession’, from ah ‘his thing’
nainki ‘to have as a valuable’, from nah ‘his valuable’
kananki ‘to have as food’, from kanah ‘his food’
nimanki ‘to have as a drink’, from nimah ‘his drink’
waranki ‘to have as a vehicle’, from warah ‘his vehicle’
ngidanki‘to have to chew’, from ngidah ‘his chaw’

inanki ‘to treat as a mother’, from inah ‘his mother’
rianki ‘to treat as a sibling’, from riah ‘his sibling’
painki ‘to be married to’, from pahioa ‘his spouse’
adanki ‘to be named’, from oadoa ‘his name’
pallanki ‘to be a counterpart of’, from poalloa ‘his counterpart’

             decoration’
     8.6.2.3 THE RELATIONAL NOUN ipah ‘IN HIS
                   POSSESSION’
The possessive constructions we have been discussing so far,
either with mine or with a possessive verb, express relations
like ownership or association. For example:121. John mine nah puk.
     ‘John has (owns) books.’122. Ngoah rianki Bill.
     ‘I treat Bill as my brother.’123. Ngoah pirin sianki rohsso.
     ‘I will use that flower as an ear decoration.’    In these cases, the thing possessed is not necessarily
present, or even in the same location as the possessor. In sen-
tence 121, the books we are discussing might be in John’s house
or in his office, while John is here with us. When we wish to ex-
press that the possessor has the object in question with him, the
relational noun ipah ‘near him, in his possession’ is used.124a.      Pukko mine ipah.
   b.      Ih mine pukko ipah.
           ‘He has the book with him.’125a.      Mine kandi ipoai.
   b.      Ngoah mine kandi ipoai.
           ‘I have candy with me.’A definite noun or pronoun may appear in subject position in
these sentences, as in 124a and b, and 125b.","[257, 258]"
"
                       0.1.2 Organization
Language is a complex mechanism. To some extent it may be
compared to a multistoried building in which small units
(bricks) are put together in a certain fashion to make larger
units (rooms, stories) which, when taken together, make up a
larger unit (the whole building). In language we might con-
sider the smallest units to be the sounds that a given language
uses. These combine together to form the larger units that we
call WORDS, which then combine according to fixed patterns to
form larger units called SENTENCES. It is also possible to con-
sider units larger than sentences, units we might call speeches,
stories, narratives, discourses, and so forth. For the most part,
sentences are the largest units with which we will be concerned
in this grammar.
   The first chapter of the grammar will be concerned with
PHONOLOGY, the study of sounds and the ways in which they
can combine. Of course, we will be dealing almost exclusively
with the phonology (sounds and sound system) of Mokilese.
Chapter 2 will deal with MORPHOLOGY, the study of the structure
of words. That subject will be taken up again, by way of sum-
mation, in chapter 11. The subject matter of the rest of the

                          Introduction
grammar will be SYNTAX, the study of the ways in which words
combine to form sentences, and, to a lesser extent, SEMANTICS,
the study of the system of meanings that are associated with
words and sentences.","[20, 21]"
"
                    3.2 NOUN PHRASES
In section 2.1, we examined constructions like woal lappo ‘that
old man’, jerimweinno ‘that boy’‚ and ah raujij kapwwo ‘his new
pants’. Each of these constructions consists of one noun (woal
‘man’, jerimwein ‘boy’, and raujij ‘pants’) and a number of other
elements. 1 Each of these elements helps to specify the meaning
of the noun in some way. In the construction woal lappo, the
word lap tells us that the man being discussed is old, while
the suffix -o points the man out as being over there, rather
than here. The noun is the most important element of each of
these constructions, however. The other morphemes in the con-
struction add in some way to the meaning of the noun.
    We call the most important element of any construction the
head of that construction. All the constructions above have
nouns as heads. A construction with a noun as head is called a
NOUN PHRASE. All other elements of a noun phrase help refine
the meaning of the head noun.
   A NOUN PHRASE, therefore, is a construction that is built
around a noun. From this it follows that the shortest possible
noun phrase consists of only a noun. Thus, in the sentence:4a.   John pirin jeila loakjid rehnnoawe.
      ‘John is going to go fishing today.’John is a noun phrase. Other more complex noun phrases can
be used in the same position (ENVIRONMENT) as the simple noun
phrase John.b.Woallo pirin jeila loakjid rehnnoawe.
  ‘That man is going to go fishing today.’c.Woalmeno pirin jeila loakjid rehnnoawe.
  ‘A certain man is going to go fishing today.’d.Woal roairoaimeno pirin jeila loakjid rehnnoawe.
  ‘A certain tall man is going to go fishing today.’                                60
                   Mokilese Reference Grammare.Woal roairoaimeno ma ngoah kapang aio pirin jeila loakjid
      rehnnoawe.
  ‘A certain tall man that I saw yesterday is going to go fishing
      today.’All of these expanded constructions are noun phrases, because
they occur in the same position (environment) as simple nouns
like John in 4a above. 2
      Any of the sentences 4a to 4e above can be replaced by:f. Ih pirin jeila loakjid rehnnoawe.
   ‘He is going to go fishing today.’The word ih ‘he’ can stand for John, woallo, woalmeno, woal
roairoaimeno, woal roairoaimeno ma ngoah kapang aio, or any
number of similar nouns or noun phrases. A word that can be
substituted for a noun or noun phrase in this way is called a
PRONOUN. Most pronouns (see section 3.4) are used to replace a
noun or noun phrase whose identity is clear to us. Thus, in:5a.     Jeri siksikko joh kak alu.
        ‘That small boy can’t walk.’b.      Ih sipwla ehn aio.
        ‘He broke his leg yesterday.’we know that ih ‘he’ in 5b refers to the small child mentioned in
sentence 5a. In this way 5b is equivalent to:c. Jeri siksikko sipwla ehn aio.
   ‘That small boy broke his leg yesterday.’We use ih ‘he’ as a substitute for jeri siksikko ‘that small boy’
rather than repeat the whole noun phrase.
    Pronouns like ngoah ‘I’ and koah ‘you’ may be thought of as
substitutes for the names of the speaker and the listener in a
conversation. Because pronouns substitute for and occur in the
same environments as nouns and noun phrases, they are them-
selves noun phrases. For example, in:6a.     Woallo mwehuki kang rais.
        ‘That man likes to eat rice.’
                                 61
                      3 Nouns and Referenceb.     Ih mwehuki kang rais.
       ‘He likes to eat rice.’c.     Ngoah mwehuki kang rais.
       ‘I like to eat rice.’d.     Koah mwehuki kang rais.
       ‘You like to eat rice.’woallo, ih, ngoah, and koah are all noun phrases.","[91, 92, 93]"
"
Verb phrases with transitive verbs usually contain a noun
phrase object of the verb, as in:
                              258
                 Mokilese Reference Grammar
In sentence 6, the verb phrase consists of the verb loakjidihda
‘fished’ and the object noun phrase mwumwwok ‘those fish’; in
7 it consists of the verb wahdo ‘brought’ and the object noun
phrase rohppo ‘that mat’.
   In addition to subject and object it is possible to include
other noun phrases (expressing instrument or goal, for ex-
ample) in a simple sentence. In most cases such noun phrases
are predicate attributes rather than parts of the verb phrase.
Thus:8a.    Ngoah kihlahng woallo pukko.
 b.    Ngoah kihla pukko oang woallo.
       ‘I took the book to the man.’ c.","[289, 290]"

                 11.7 VERBS AND NOUNS
There are many examples of Mokilese words of exactly the same
form with both verbal and nominal meanings. In many cases
most Mokilese would feel that the verbal meaning is central and
                                 312
                   Mokilese Reference Grammar
that the nominal meaning is derived from it. In other cases the
opposite might be true, and in still others it is difficult to decide.
Some examples are:aproa n         ‘his shoulder’
aproa v         ‘to carry on the shoulder’inapnap n       ‘a cushion’
inapnap v       ‘to cushion’deidei n        ‘a man-made taro patch’
deidei v        ‘to dig’kojuk n         ‘a gun’
kojuk v         ‘to shoot’    Keeping this problem in mind, let us consider processes that
allow words to change their word class membership. In section
11.5.3, we discussed various nominalization processes, by
which a verb can be converted into a noun. In the following
section we will review several forms of the opposite process,
that is, nouns being converted into verbs.","[343, 344]"
"16.Kihdoahng ngoahi apas pinjellen apel jiluw poaun in
   koahpihen.
   ‘Give me one pencil and three pounds of coffee.’ (said in a
   store, for example)17.Ngoah anahne emen woallo ma kidal lalin Kusahi.
   ‘I need a man who speaks Kusaiean.’18.Ekij pillen en wijekdo.
   ‘Some water should be brought.’

                         4 Quantification
In such cases the preceding numeral has the meaning ‘some’ or
‘any’. With a singular determiner the whole noun phrase refers
to any of a certain kind of object; with a plural determiner it
refers to any of a particular group of objects.19a.   Ih mwehuki epwi pukko.
       ‘He wants some books.’  b.   Ih mwehuki epwi pukkok.
       ‘He wants some of those books.’

A partitive construction is used to refer to a definite number of
a definite group of objects.","[132, 133]"
"In the Mokilese sentences 2a and 2b, the form of the verb ra-
pahki ‘look for’ is the same in spite of the fact that one sentence
describes present time and the other past. Mokilese, therefore,
does not demand that we make a decision about the time of the
event whenever we use a verb.
    While English verbs seem to focus on the time distinction,
Mokilese demands that decisions be made about other features
of an event. For example, every time we use a Mokilese verb we
have to decide whether the verb is merely naming an event or
is stating that the event is actually in progress.3a.   Ngoah raprapahki ih me.
      ‘I’m looking for him here.’ b.   Ngoah raprapahki ih aio.
      ‘I was looking for him yesterday.’

                             9 Aspect
    Sentences 2a and 2b name the action of ‘searching, looking
for’, while 3a and 3b state that it actually is/was going on. This
distinction can be expressed in English (as indicated by the dif-
ferent translations for rapahki ‘looked for’ in 2b, and rapraphki
‘was looking for’ in 3b, but more often is not. 1
    Here, then we have an example of Mokilese neutralizing
(collapsing, not expressing in a distinct way) a distinction that
seems to be always made in English—that between present
and past tense—and of English neutralizing a distinction that
is always made in Mokilese—that between ongoing events and
events in which ongoingness is not important.
   Mokilese also demands that we express how far an event has
gone towards the attainment of its final goal. In the case of the
verb rapahki ‘to look for’, the final goal is obviously to find the
object one is looking for. If that goal has been reached, we must
mark that fact in the verb.4a.    Ngoah rapahkihda ih me.
       ‘I found him here.’ b.    Ngoah rapahkihda ih aio.
       ‘I found him yesterday.’    In this example, English uses an entirely different verb, ‘to
find’, in order to express an idea that is shown in Mokilese
merely by adding a suffix. In other cases English expresses a
similar idea by means of adverbs like ‘up’.5a.     Ngoah kang raisso.
        ‘I ate that rice.’ b.     Ngoah kangla raisso.
        ‘I ate up that rice.’Sentence 5a does not tell us how much of the rice was eaten,
while 5b states that all the rice was eaten, this being the logical
goal or conclusion of eating rice.
   It is to such characteristics of an event as its ongoingness
and goal attainment that we give the term ASPECT. The former,
ongoingness, we call PROGRESSIVE ASPECT. It is expressed in
Mokilese by the process of REDUPLICATION (see 2.1.5). The latter,
goal attainment, we call PERFECTIVE ASPECT. It is normally ex-

pressed in Mokilese by the addition of directional suffixes to the
verb. These processes and their use will be discussed in more
detail in the sections that follow.","[260, 261, 262]"
