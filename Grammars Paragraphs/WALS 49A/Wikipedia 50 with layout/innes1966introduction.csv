   Grebo has a system of four tone levels; tone is not marked in Grebo writing, but
in this book, where it is necessary to mark tone, this will be shown by numerals.
The method of tone marking is:              1.     High tone is marked with 1:            kê 1         chief
              2.     High-mid tone is marked with 2:        bi 2         beat
              3.     Low-mid tone is marked with 3:         ya 3         bring
              4.     Low tone is marked with 4:             pü 4         swell
 Gliding tones are marked with a combination of two (or, rarely, three) numerals
joined by a hyphen: hu 3-2 throw
 Some examples of the tone marking of longer words are:                   ylba 21     face               pôbô 3-23        owl

Of these, only the pairs e, é and o, 0 call for comment; e and é are both half-close             there are a few words like ffi ‘flea’ in which consonant clusters occur even in slow
front vowels, and o and ô are both half-close back vowels. They are perhaps best                 speech. These are mostly, if not all, loanwords.

bo, a language closely related to Grebo. In Sapir’s terms é and ô are ‘muffled’ vowels,
and e and o are ‘bright’ vowels.                                                                                   p1   pie    <    pédé              bald patch

There are, however, some words in which a consonant cluster occurs even in slow
speech. Most, if not all, of these are loanwords.                                              Of these, (2) and (4) are common in CV words; (1) is rare, and (3) is extremely rare

and also to some extent between stems and suffixes.
Very briefly, for descriptive purposes, it is possible to divide the vowels into three sets:                      low               low-mid     high-mid            high                      ___________________________               _____________                                           ~ semitones 23/a semitones     3¾ semitones

     1.     Plural suffixes -a    -â + -bo ‘s’ -bó
                                 ‘.‘
                                                                                                  du~ pounding                     cf. du pound
                                                                                                      ne k~ duc             I have to pound, I must pound

     2.     Plural suffixes {-i} + -a    -à   ‘~‘                                           2.   A noun in -da 2-1    -na 2-1 (see p. 21):

Plural forms in which a combination of two plural suffixes occurs will be called
double plurals.                                                                             3.   A noun in -da 3    -na 3 —‘ -3 (see p. 21):

                                     POSTPOSITIONS
                                                                                            Some other common postpositions are:
    A class is set up of those words that occur in the position occupied by ft in phrases
 like:                                                                                             ma     in (liquids, masses); to (persons)
                                   mo ft    near me                                                       bla ma         in rice

 Some words of this class are:                                                                     kE     on top of, on

                nya        in front of          e.g. mo nya in front of me                                teble ke      on the table
                lé         behind

 Words of this class will be called Postpositions.                                                        söë nyc       in poverty
   Some postpositions have the same shape as nouns denoting parts of the body,
 but they are distinguished from these by a difference in syntactical distribution.                biO    under; in (buildings)
                                                                                                          teble biO     under the table
Postpositions occur as second immediate constituent in phrases whose first inunediate
                                                                                                          ka biO        in the house
constituent is an object pronoun, but nouns do not occur in this position; nouns
occur as second immediate constituent in phrases whose first immediate constituent                 nya    in front of, opposite
is a possessive pronoun, and also as third immediate constituent in genitival phrases                     kae nya        in front of the house, opposite the house
(see p. 93), but postpositions do not occur in these positions. Compare for example:                      mo nya         in front of me

     but which do not occur in the position filled by di and ijmo in sentences like:                kae pudóôb       white house                cf. pudô       be white

     Some words occur in both sets of test sentences, e.g. ijmo ‘horn’:                             kae pudôôb~      a white house

  These are nouns, since nouns are defined as words which occur in the test frame         type are associated with some CVCV verbal stems, but not with CV stems:
  o/e   —no ‘it is their  (see P. 37).
                         —‘
                                                                                                    hi ky~kã         hard wood                  cf. kyàkã      be hard
    Words which occur in the first set of test sentences, but not in the second will be             kae pudô         white house                cf. pudô       be white
 called Post-nominal Adjectives. (The qualification ‘Post-nominal’ is added to dis
 tinguish words which occur in the above test sentences from words like pudóô             Verbal adjectives of both types are associated with some CVCV stems, but with
 ‘white’, which occur in phrases like pudóô kae ‘a white house’, and which are called     others only one type of adjective is associated:

        which is formally plural, because Yoabo here denotes not the people but the
        land they occupy; cf.                                                              404 p0 n~e ô: contraction of po n~ ne no ô ‘you have said now’; ne no ‘now’.

427 o hina ne gyi: ‘they gave it commotion’, i.e. ‘they gave it an enthusiastic recep
      tion’.
431 Téglétéglé: ‘all the Grebo’; the derivation is not known; glé is probably to be
      identified with gédé/glé ‘species of monkey’, but the meaning of té is obscure.
431 Hnabla: a personal name, with no particular significance at the present day.
435 glé: syncopated form of gédé; see p. 15.

       does not occur in the name of the people, which is formed from glé           -be
       ‘person’ (p1. -ho). When keeping count of a number of objects, the Grebo
       commonly use kernels or small stones, each representing one item. At public
       meetings, for example, the number of people present is recorded in this way;
       when a person leaves the meeting, one kernel is removed from the pile.
443 gwaena: verbal noun from ijwae, a causative derivative verb from ijwa ‘lose’.
444 Glébo: syncopated form of Gédébo. The English spelling ‘Grebo’ seems to be
       due to a mis-hearing of the second consonant sound. The spelling ‘Glebo’
       is in fact preferred by some Grebo writers in English, for example by Wallace
       in his booklet Why Glebo?, but the spelling ‘Grebo’ is now so firmly estab

  who launched and then capsized went back and penetrated inland and are now living
  inland from us. The name of these shall be ‘Wodebo’, because they capsized and
   then came back. And those who remained behind did not launch at all, but remained
   there and came to look for us, but they passed us and went toward the Kru area;
   their name shall be ‘Sekedewe’ because when we were leaving the town of the Mu
   niewe they remained behind; they did not attempt a launching at all.
       ‘Comrades, what about ourselves? We ought to bear in mind what we have been
   through when we are giving ourselves a name. Our name should be ‘Gedebeo’,
   because on our way here we mounted the waves just as the gede monkey climbs
    trees.’ Immediately they sounded their rattles in support of him, and the resulting
    uproar rose to the heavens.
       When it had subsided they appointed people, telling them, ‘Go to Taa and tell
    our comrades there, so that they may know about these new names.’ When this
    news reached Taa, the inhabitants were very pleased with it. They gave it an en
    thusiastic reception, and praised Gyoo Wea and their parent group. And they ap
     proved these names also.
        At this time the inhabitants of Taa said, ‘Well, if that is how it is, then we should
     see that our medicine, which we have brought with us, is given a name too.’ So they
     agreed on a name for their medicine; they called it Tegletegle a Hnabla. So it re
     mained for a time, then they shortened the name and called it Tetegle a Hnabla.

   In phrases whose second IC is nen~/nenc, the 1st and 2nd singular pronouns may
 be omitted, and person is then marked by the tone of nen~/neng only:                            7.    Noun + Genitival link a          Noun                      nanen~221                                                                Examples of phrases of this type are:

 There seems to be little or no difference in meaning between the members of pairs
 like dc n~ no and c dc nc no.                                                              Preliminary to a description of the commoner types of sentence, it is necessary

These are both nominal phrases of type 5, whose 1st IC is na, and whose 2nd IC is
duu bla and bla duuba respectively.                                                         (b) Exclamations:

  For commands in the 2nd singular, the imperative mood is used; for commands              (a) nene live by
in all other persons, the subjunctive mood is used:                                        This is followed in object position by a phrase whose 2nd IC is kong ‘life, world’:
           dubia     24          pound rice (Command addressed to one person)                     ne nene pö~ kong I live by fishing hunting

           bo du bla 2 2 4       let them pound rice
                                                                                                  ne nena& London I was in London
The negative subjunctive mood is used for negative commands in all persons:
                                                                                         Neo also occurs in sentences like:

       3.   Hue, and derivative verb hnedc.
        Only these two forms are found; they are tense 1 indicative mood forms of the
     kind listed on pp. 78-79. Hnc and hnedc occur in simple sentences with a noun,
     nominal phrase or emphatic pronoun as subject, and also in relative clauses with
     a relative pronoun as subject:

     Negative conjugation
       Two points are to be noticed in the negative conjugation:
       1.   nede, nede, neo
       In verbal phrases containing auxiliary verb yi, suffixes -de, -dii and -o occur with
     the auxiliary verb and not with ne:
                         ne yidade London ne                 I was not in London yesterday
                         cf. ne nenade London                I was in London yesterday.
       2.   ma
       Pairs of negative sentences are found like:
                         neyidakëmal
                                     I was not chief yesterday
                         neyidake  j
     The members of this pair differ slightly in meaning; in the first sentence k~ ‘chief’
     is slightly more emphatic than in the second.
        Pairs of negative sentences like these are found only for verb ma; in the case of
     all other verbs, phrases corresponding to the first member of the pair only are found:
                         ne yida kpe ne              I was not strong yesterday            cf. ne be

 Conditional clauses may be introduced by:                                                                                                               stay here till I come
                                                                                                                                    nedede be di
                                                                                                                                     21241

                                                                                                                            This last sentence does not imply whether he did in fact come or not.
  In a conditional clause introduced by one of these, the ‘if’ is slightly more emphatic:
                                                                                                                               2. Those that refer to events that have occurred. Clauses of this kind have past
           bairn ne dida a mlnaa bla duda ne ma                                    if I had come yesterday he would have

                                                                                                                            The result mood is used; the same tense occurs in both clauses:
     minaa consists of mi (secondary stem of mu ‘go’)      -na ‘yesterday tense’     -o
                                                                                                                                    ne nedadede a dida I was here yesterday till he came
  ‘there’, with assimilation of o to a.                                                                                               1     12122    11      It should be noticed that many conditional mood clauses which have future time                                        This sentence may mean either (a) that I waited with the intention of seeing him,
  reference or timeless habitual meaning are more appropriately translated in English                                       or (b) that my being there and his coming occurred in temporal sequence, but that
  by a ‘when’ clause than by an ‘if’ clause. In sentences of this kind, the main clause                                     one event was not contingent upon the other.
   is commonly introduced by ne 1 ‘then’:
            gwe ba woade ne ne mua ne when the sun rises tomorrow then I shall go
                    2       2        21     1       1   1     12    2            ba di ne a hi mo kwcdekpa                                     when/whenever he comes he gives me a present
                2       1       123-2           2           212-1
   Ne ‘then’ does not introduce clauses containing a verbal phrase with auxiliary ml:
             ba nua nc a nua kâ ma                                 if he does it tomorrow he will be wrong

        A subjunctive phrase which occurs in those positions in which nouns occur is                    ba nua nc a kftâ ne                        if he does it tomorrow he will be wrong
      regarded as a single syntactical unit; such a unit will be called a holophrastic sub                  2    12       42     22        2     junctive.                                                                                          ba nuna nc a kana ne                       if he did it before yesterday he was wrong

        A holophrastic subjunctive commonly occurs where the use of a verbal noun
     would involve a sequence of two possessive pronouns:                                      4.   Result Mood

 In many cases there is little or no difference in meaning between a holophrastic            With this last sentence, contrast:
 subjunctive and the corresponding phrase containing a verbal noun:                                     a léléda ba nuna nc                        he told us to do it, he told us that we must do it

                 na London muc flu ftc   j~           my going to London is good A possessive pronoun can occur before a holophrastic subjunctive; this gives em               5.   Imperative Mood
 phasis either to the pronoun or to the verbal stem, depending on the context:                 There are four tenses of the imperative mood:                   be la nc ya blidi                                                                    Tense 1                   du bla 2 4              pound rice

   As will be seen from the above lists of pronouns, each series has two 3rd sg. pro
nouns and two 3rd p1. pronouns. In the following description of the difference in
usage between the members of these pairs, statements about pronouns a and c are
valid for all pronouns with vowels a and ~ respectively; likewise for the plural pro
nouns o and e.
   In very general terms, a may be said to be used of large, important or valuable
things, including human beings, and ~ of small, unimportant or worthless things.
   Many nouns are referred to by both~ and s. A word denoting a part of the body,
for example, is referred to by~ when the part of the body in question is that of a
human being or of a large animal like a sheep, goat, leopard or horse, but by ~ when

                                   CHAPTER 1                               ORTHOGRAPHY
Alphabet
   Although Grebo has now been written for about a hundred years, the amount
of literature which has been produced is slight, and the orthography has not yet
been completely standardised. In recent years several orthographic innovations
have been made by individual writers, but none of these seems to have been generally
accepted. From an orthographic point of view the most important writer in Grebo
is undoubtedly Bishop Auer, whose hymn-book, which was published in 1873, has
been widely used and has had a considerable influence on Grebo spelling. Since
Auer’s orthography is so well established and commands such widespread support
among the Grebo, it is used here, with only such modifications as may reasonably
be expected to be widely acceptable. The general purpose of these modifications is
to reduce the number of diacritically modified letters.
   About the representation of the majority of Grebo sounds there is no problem,
and all writers are in agreement. There is, on the other hand, a marked lack of
agreement about the representation of the following:                             I.    the velar nasal
                             2.    the labio-velar nasal
                             3.    the nasal semi-vowel
                             4.    the three palatals
                              5.   the three E-vowels
                              6.   the three 0-vowels.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"

   In the indicative, subjunctive and conditional moods two aspects are distinguished;            nene consists of ne ‘be, live’       -ne ‘instrumental’
