9.7. The form which we call 'directive' is called 'subjunctive' by
     TuckerTucker (1940: 226) calls what we are calling 'directive' the 'subjunctive'.
He says that it is used in sentences expressing 'permission, compulsion
or doubt'. He comments that it very often follows the auxiliary verbs 6a,
εΒε, de (meaning 'make, let'), and in Ma'di it can follow Ιε ('want').
Tucker comments on the fact that the word order does not seem to match
the pronoun paradigm: the paradigm, including ka in the third person is
like the paradigm for inflected verbs, but the word order is like the word
order for uninflected verbs.
   Tucker further suggests that the subjunctive (directive) is used in the
dialect he calls Pandikeri (our 'Burulo) in a narrative to express a
sequence of actions. As evidence he cites a translation of two verses from
the New Testament. W e think this is not correct for the dialect he is
discussing, and arises in his examples as a stylistic use of the directive to
give an effect of high formality in the Biblical translation.

                   Suffixed subordinate verbsIn this chapter we look at verbs which have a low tone prefix and one of
five suffixes: kä, 1ε, re, fia, and djó.
    These verbs are contained in subordinate clauses which can be
complement to a verb, or a modifier of a noun (ie. relative clause) or a
modifier of a missing noun (ie. headless relative). In this chapter we focus
on the internal structure of the clauses: the kinds of subject and object
they have. In chapter 16 we consider the roles played by these clauses as
arguments and modifiers.
    In the glosses we use square brackets to mark the boundaries of the
subordinate clauses; this is an aid to the reader. In a few cases we are in
doubt about the placement of a boundary and in these cases we have not
indicated boundaries in the glosses. We gloss all suffixes as -SB. We
gloss the prefix as N-.","[205, 206, 207]"

1.1.   The name of the language and of the peopleThe speakers refer to themselves and are known to others as the màdl In
standard orthography this is Ma'di; the apostrophe indicates that d is
implosive. The speakers refer to their language as màdi ti, literally
'Ma'di mouth'. Among themselves, Ma'dis refer to each other as
belonging to this or that súnι 'clan' or 'tribe', which may further be
broken down into pä 'the descendants of which in some cases overlap
with sum. While a Ma'di can only marry from outside the clan, this is
normally within the group of people who speak Ma'di as the common
language.",[17]
"The adjoined subject can itself be a pronoun, in which case the sequence
of adjoined pronoun and true subject pronominal can merge into what we
call a 'long pronoun'.
   A definite subject can be marked as plural by adding ki "" which
follows the subject and precedes the inflected verb (11), but follows the
uninflected verb (12).(11)    ka     kl      eßi   ßä       rá

13.1.2.3.     Possessive pronouns
Possessive pronouns are NS-pronouns which are complements to the
postposition ?á. The postposition raises the tone on the singular pronoun
(all postpositions do this to singular pronouns and demonstratives). Both
the glottal [?] and the final vowel of the pronoun are deleleted, with low
tones also lost; these are all typical phonological processes of the
language.

Possessive ?i as a postposition in relation to locational ?a ?a has the syntax of a postposition, in that it can take a full noun phrase
complement. Furthermore ?a has the effect of raising the tone on a
preceding pronoun or deictic. This is an effect seen with postpositions,
which further justifies the identification of ?a as a postposition. As is
often the case with sequences of grammatical words, there is also the
potential for deletion of segments. This is seen when a pronoun is
followed by ?a. The glottal stop is deleted, and the final vowel of the
pronoun is deleted; tones remain. Thus for example 'your (singular)' is
not pi ?á but pá. The vowel of the combined pronoun + postposition
can itself be deleted along with the low tone: thus má ?à ëndrè is
realized as mendre 'my mother'.
    The possessive postposition ?a might in principle be related to the
locative postposition ?a 'in' (parallel to the relation between possessive
dri and locational dri). The phonological difference between ?a and ?a
might possibly be a manifestation of the floating low determiner which
perhaps always following the postposition phrase when it expresses
possession, which by a regular phonological process would lower the mid
tone: ?a + "" —> ?a. The possibility that the specific LOW determiner
follows the word might explain why no other determiner can follow it. It
also recalls the possibility of having the low determiner suffixed to a
postposition phrase with dri (whose tone would not be affected).
However, there are three clear differences between ?a and ?a apart from
the tone, which somewhat militates against the possibility that one is
derived from the other. First, ?a is more widely used as a locational
postposition in Ugandan Ma'di than in Lokai, but ?a is not used as a
                                                                Premodifiers 301possessional postposition at all. Second, locational ?a takes only an
inanimate complement; this is not true for possessional ?a. Third,
locational ?ä takes an indefinite complement, while possessive ?à takes a
definite complement. Finally we note that 'Burulo has ?a but does not
have the LOW specific determiner, which also somewhat militates against
our hypothetical derivation.","[315, 316, 317]"
"The generic weather word vù has a range of meanings including 'earth,
world, land, state of weather'; it also carries some implications of a
supernatural force, fate, or deity.(73)     vu     ö-ΐε        ßa      m        kö
         fate   3-want      INC     BEN     NEG(N)
         'Fate doesn't want it for us.' (eg. the inevitability of someone's
         death)When used as a subject of a weather sentence or a sentence describing the
environmental situation, the kind of weather is determined by the verb.
Verbs include dò 'roar' (for thunder), ägü 'flash' (for lightning), owl
'dawn', nl 'darken', âijgwé 'lighten', emú 'come' (for the gathering of
clouds before rain; nonpast only), ëml 'warm up', ecfße 'cool down'.(74)     va             k-ägü

5.3.   The subject as the patient of a transitive predicate
A transitive verb characteristically assigns its subject the thematic role of
agent and its object the thematic role of patient. It is possible for the
subject instead to be assigned the patient thematic role. The effect is
similar to passive in English, though achieved by different syntactic
means.",[104]
"
5.1.1.3. Number of syllables in a verb
Most verbs are lexically of one or two syllables, to which syntactically
relevant affixes and clitics can be added. Verbs of one syllable are all
consonant-initial with a CV structure, with the possible exception of a
'breathe' (in free variation with ?a). Verbs of two syllables are all vowel-
initial with a VCV structure in Lokai, though 'Burulo adds initial 1- to
some of these verbs. In many but not all cases we can analyse the initial
vowel in a two-syllable verb as a lexical prefix (4.5.1).
    We have found twenty-five three-syllable verbs, of which twenty-two
begin with i or (in two cases) i. Most of these can be shown to be
loanwords, where the source is typically a bisyllabic word with an initial

begin with a consonant). Thus Acholi β ajo 'multiply' is the source for
Ma'di ίβεί, Swahili pima 'measure' is the basis for Ma'di ipimà. An
initial vowel i- can in other cases be interpreted as a causative prefix, but
this is not generally the case for the three-syllable words. Instead the
initial i can often be interpreted here as an epenthetic vowel added to
normalize syllable structure.
    We have found two four-syllable verbs, both ideophones beginning
with i: itfetfere 'to make fast foot movements' and itëtërè 'to cackle'.","[88, 89]"
"
6.1.2.2. SuppletionsThere are some suppletions in the plural; uku is 'women' corresponding
to singular hi 'woman'. In some cases, the suffix -ndjf is used, usually in
combination with a suppletion or with other morphological changes
(alternative forms of the plural are idiolectal or dialectal). Suppletions are
found only for nouns of gender, age, kinship and occupation.",[115]
"   A noun phrase can be a sequence of ?a phrase followed by a noun,
followed by the determiner nä. In some cases the interpretation of such a
phrase suggests that the ?a phrase and head noun together constitute a
noun phrase functioning as a modifier of an empty head; thus being
'Opi's child' is a characteristic rather than an identity in (27).(27)    opi         ?a            6ará                  na      ma        nil               ku
        Opi    POSS    child       AFR IS        know    NEG(N)
        Ί don't know any who is / the one who is Opi's child.'(28)    ópi    ?a          àd3u        na          má ndre          gbù              kûrù
        Opi POSS spear AFR Is see           before NEG(P)
        Ί have never seen any which is Opi's spear.'
298     Modification of the noun (including possession)
In other cases, the interpretation suggests that the noun is really the head
of the phrase with nâ as the determiner.(29)        ma     ndre        όρί           a      ad^ú         nâ   gbù       kûrù
            IS  see     Opi POSS spear        AFR before NEG(P)
            Ί haven't seen the one which is Opi's spear before.'","[313, 314]"
"    The whole clause can function as a relative clause, though k5 (heading
the relative) is unsuffixed in this case, and takes a subject, parallel to the
relativization of a clause with mü. Note the use of pi as the pronoun in the
two examples.(173)   ago     pi    ko        ίζΓ          ni ndre            ή       όρί   ?i
         man [2S N-PROS [wife-DEF PR(N)-see]] DEF                       Op FOC
         'The man (you are about to see his wife) is Opi.'",[457]
"6.1.7.   Compound        nounsThe only true kind of compound in Ma'di is a compound noun.
Compound nouns are most commonly formed by combining two nouns,
and are most typically interpreted as possessor + possessed.(9)       dsónu                      or    d^oml
          d^o       +     nu
          house          eye
          'window'They are structurally equivalent to noun phrases of the 'possessor ni
possessed' type (13.1.1); thus the compound      'floor' resembles the
104     Other word classes
phrase djo ni ?á 'the inner part of a house'. Compounds are
differentiated from analogous phrases by idiosyncratic meanings, and in
some cases by ATR harmonization (4.1.7).
   In some cases, the combination appears to be a noun followed by a
postposition, but the postposition might possibly also be analyzed as a
noun in this case:(10)      mlakò
          mi + ako
          eye      absence / without
          'blindness'Some compounds appear to contain the possessive postposition ?a
(13.1.2) but there are two major differences between compounds with this
word and phrases with this word where the postposition takes as its
preceding complement a possessor. In a phrase the possessor + ?a
combination precedes the possessed thing; in the compound it follows. In
a phrase the possessor must be animate; this restriction does not hold in
the compound.(11)       lukù(fóèji?à
          lukùcfó èji      ?à
           pot       water POSS
           'water pot'(12)*     èj'i  ?à           lukùcfó
          water POSS         pot
6.2.     Adjectives
6.2.1. Singular adjectives: characteristic toneSingular native adjectives have a strong tendency towards final high tone,
with the first syllable usually being either low or high (and some cases of
initial mid tone).","[119, 120]"
"
11.2.1.1.   Nonverbal clauses without overt subjectsNonverbal clauses without overt subjects are found in root and
subordinate positions. Here we deal with the root clause; subordinate
nonverbal clauses are the subject of section 11.5. If a root nonverbal
clause has a null pronominal subject and no noun phrase is pre-adjoined
to it, the clause will overtly consist just of the predicate. This is found
only when the predicate contains ?1 or 1ε\
11.2.1.2.   Evidence for the analysis in this sectionIn this section we have claimed that the nonverbal predicate always has a
pronominal subject. If the pronominal subject is third person, it is non-
overt, and either a noun phrase is adjoined to it (in which case the
adjoined phrase takes on the role of subject), or no noun phrase is
adjoined (in which case the null pronominal is interpreted as expletive).
We now briefly review some evidence for this approach.
1. This approach offers a uniform account of arguments: now all
arguments are always pronominale, overt or null, whether subject of verb,
object of verb, or subject of nonverbal predicate.
2. We know that the full noun phrase at the beginning of a nonverbal
clause can be separated from the predicate by 1ε or ile \ When the noun
phrase is third person, the structure is as follows:
   adjoined subject + ( 7 ) 1ε + non-overt pronominal subject + predicate
When the noun phrase is first or second person, the structure is as
follows:
   adjoined subject + lie"" + overt pronominal subject + predicate
The fact that the pronominal must be repeated after lié suggests that this
is an obligatory position for a pronominal. Where it is apparently omitted,
as in the third person case, we might sugggest that there is still a
pronominal there, but that it is non-overt.
                                                 Subject and adjoined subject   2373. Clauses with bare ?1 and if consist of a noun phrase followed by one
of these two words. In principle, we might take the noun phrase to be the
subject, with ?ior le' as the predicate. But there are two reasons to think
that the noun phrase is not the subject in these clauses, and must therefore
be part of the predicate, in which case the clause can only have a null third
person pronominal subject. The first reason is that if we see the NP as
pre-adjoined to ?1 in this type of clause, then we can say that ?1 always has
a noun phrase pre-adjoined to it. The second and clinching reason is that
if the NP is a name or SPEC-phrase it is not followed by m; if it were the
subject of a nonverbal predicate, rii would be obligatory after the phrase in
this clause. This strongly suggests that the NP is part of the predicate,
pre-adjoined to ?1 (or 1ε ).","[252, 253]"
"
4.5.4. ReduplicationThere are many situations in Ma'di sentences where a word is
immediately followed by its copy. It is not immediately obvious in many
cases whether the pair of words should be considered as a single word,
derived by a lexical process of reduplication, or as a pair of words, each of
which is a syntactically distinct item.
    The clearest case where copying involves two distinct syntactic
constituents is in verb focus, where a verb is copied and the copy placed
in final position followed by a low tone, as a way of focusing the verb.
The verb and its copy need not be adjacent, which shows that they do not
combine as a single word (19.12.1). Another fairly clearly syntactic kind
of reduplication involves reduplication of a final constituent since this can
be a phrase (eg. a postposition phrase); this is presumably a syntactic
                                    The general morphology of Ma 'di words   67process; it gives a meaning of regularity, repetition or immediacy (18.2.5).
    More clearly lexical kinds of reduplication involve adjectives and
nouns. Reduplication of an adjective gives a meaning analogous to
English -er or -ish. Thus we find ali 'short', and àiiàii 'shorter' or
'shortish, rather short'. The reduplicated adjective can then be
nominalized, for example as allai! 'a series of shortnesses' with the
characteristic tone of abstract nouns. Nouns may also be reduplicated
with a meaning similar to that of reduplicated adjectives; these
reduplicated nouns might in fact be categorially adjectives (or sentential
modifiers). Thus màdi 'person' is reduplicated as màdi màdi to mean
'like a person; in the manner typical of a person'.
    Some adjectives or sentential modifiers change meanings in
unpredictable ways when reduplicated. Pairs include mgbë 'immediately'
and mgbë mgbë 'recently'; ëzè 'a long time ago' and ëzè εζε, 'quickly,
hurriedly'; Bo 'intact' and Bo Bo (dru) 'temporarily'; tfirì or tfírí 'silent'
tßtßn 'silently'.
    Some reduplicated words have no unreduplicated base; this is true for
example of pélópéló 'house pole', where there is no *péló. Similarly
some words expressing manner exist in reduplicated forms where the
non-reduplicated morpheme does not exist as an isolated word. They
include: π π 'hurriedly' but *n; and t/e tfé 'slowly' but *f/e; and re ré
'immediately, as soon as' but *re.","[82, 83]"

19.8.5.   The structure of LOW-?! focusWhat is the LOW tone in this structure? There are several other types of
low tone which might be the same as this.
  (a)  It might be the low tone determiner, which makes a noun phrase
       specific; in this case it perhaps makes the preceding clause
       specific (in some sense). We think this is the best analysis.
  (b) It might be the same low tone as is attached as a suffix to the
       focused verb (and is possibly seen also in ni).
  (c) It might be the low tone prefix seen on nonpast (and subordinate
       suffixed) verbs, presumably attaching as a prefix in this case to ?1
       which would thus be in some sense verb-like.
Or it might be a different morpheme from any of these. In glossing the
examples we have assumed that it is (a) the specific determiner.","[590, 591]"
"
13.1.1.1.       Possessive ni vs. grammatical niThe pronominal ni is used after noun phrases with the definite and
specific determiner LOW, and is obligatory when such noun phrases are
in object and nonverbal subject positions. This ni, which we call
'grammatical ni' is unable to follow an indefinite noun phrase. In
contrast, possessive ni can only follow an indefinite. We suggest that the
two kinds of ni are different words, accidental homophones.(14)    ìtù                 àtfi
            sun           hot
            'The sun is hot.'(15)*   itu         m       àtfi
            sun    PR     hot         (grammatical m)
            'The sun is hot.'(16)    itu         m       àtfi
            sun   PR     hotness          (possessive nl )
            'The sun's hotness'There are three reasons to think that possessive ni might in fact be a
variant of the postposition ni (in contrast we suggested in 12.1.3.1 that
grammatical ni is a variant of the pronoun âni). First, it would mean that,
like the dn strategy and probably the ?a strategy, this is another example
of a postpositional strategy for possession. Second, the tonal difference
between the possessional ni and the postposition ni is parallel to the tonal
difference between the possessional ?a and the postposition ?a; in both
cases, a tone is lowered one step to get possession. Third, the Logbara
cognate is actually a high tone ni (homophonous in Logbara with the
postposition ni); Crazzarola does not treat them as the same (1960: 141).
296       Modification of the noun (including possession)    However, if ni is a variant of postposition ni, it is not only a
phonological variant but also has different selectional properties. While
postposition m takes a wide range of NP structures but requires the
complement to be animate, possessional ni takes a restricted range of NP
structures (bare noun and noun + LOW only) and has no animacy
restriction.
    These selectional properties also distinguish possessive ni from its
homophone, the ni used after specific noun phrases. It is thus likely that
while possessive ni is a postposition which is homophonous with
pronominal ni, they are not related words.","[311, 312]"

3.5.2.4. Tone in monomorphemic nouns and adjectives (mostly
         loanwords) of three or more syllablesThe two most common tonal patterns in trisyllabic monomorphemic
nouns and adjectives are HML and LHL, with a few LLL words. Most are
loanwords.       sákáni         'plate'      HML       from Arabic sa'an
       pagani         'pagan'      LHL       from English pagan
       fàlànì         'vest'       LLL       from Swahili falaniIt is possible that the choice of a tonal pattern derives in some cases from
an assignment of high tone to a perceived accented or stressed syllable on
the original form of the loanword.
    A few words are variable in tone. Examples include ndsákátá and
ndsàkàtà 'mud'; tfípákwí and tfipákwí 'sand particles', and kénd^é and
kèrìdsé 'calabash'; note that these have nonstandard tonal patterns.
Almost all trisyllabic monomorphemes are loanwords. Among the few
exceptions which we have found are lòfunò 'a teenager, male', kàsià 'last
born of a family' (both LHL), and àula 'a dancing ornament' (LLL). It is
worth noting that 'teenager' has the 'loanword' tonal pattern lòfunò in
the singular but in the plural has a 'native' tonal pattern lófünó.
    Almost all monomorphemes of four syllables or higher are nouns, and
may all be loanwords. For monomorphemic words of four syllables, the
typical tonal patterns are LHML, LLHL and HMML, which can be seen
as related to one another and also related to the common LHL and HML
patterns on trisyllables.       sùkàrià      'diabetes'     LLHL      from Arabic sukaria
       rùzàrìò      'rosary'       LHML      from English rosary
       àmbìlèsì     'ambulance'    HMML      from English ambulanceFor some loanwords there is a correlation between tonal pattern and the
                                                                   Tones       41educatedness of the speaker. Thus tèlèfunì with a LLHL pattern is more
nativized, and telèfoni with a HMML pattern is more educated.
   We have found three five-syllable monomorphemes, all loanwords; all
have the pattern LLHML; eg. ìtìnasarà 'twelve'(from Juba Arabic
itnashra). The only six syllable monomorpheme we have found is
kòfìrìmàslò 'confirmation' with a MMMHML pattern.
   In summary, nouns and adjectives of three or more syllables tend to be
loanwords. The tonal pattern L* (=LLL) is found on trisyllables only.
The tonal patterns LHL and HML are found on trisyllables, and in variant
forms on longer words: as LLHL, LHML, HMML and LLHML and
MMHML.","[56, 57]"
"6.3.1. Homophony between (some) postpositions and nounsSome postpositions are homophonous with nouns naming body parts, it
is possible in some cases that these words actually are 'locational nouns',
with the preceding constituent in fact being a possessor of the noun or
compounded with the noun.

determining which meanings are expressed by noun-homophonous
postpositions and those which are not.

6.4.    Pronominals
6.4.1. Meanings and functions of pronominals6.4.1.1. PersonPronouns differentiate first, second and third persons. The default first
person plural pronoun excludes the addressee. In addition there are
pronouns which we refer to as 'indefinite/inclusive', which are
ambiguous between (definite) inclusive first person ( Ί and you') and
indefinite third person.","[123, 124]"
"In the following example (gloss a) the postposition phrase opi dn 'to
opi' is reduplicated to mean 'to Opi regularly'. (Gloss b translates a
different syntactic structure and is not relevant here.)(239)      ju      ke      opi    dn     opi     dn
            2SDIR  give Opi BEN Opi BEN
            (a) '(You should) give it/them to Opi (regularly).' (eg. you
                are regularly paid money by someone and this person must
                regularly give it to Opi)
            (b) '(You should) give Opi's to Opi.' (In this reading, the
                first dn is possessive, and this is not a reduplicated form)
There is a core meaning in all cases which is that the eventuality
immediately follows on from another eventuality. The two eventualities
might be different in kind or might be of the same kind repeated. By
preference the verb is nonpast and with a habitual interpretation. Iterative
forms of verbs are also preferred.
   Though noun + postposition combinations can be reduplicated,
reduplication here looks like a lexical rather than a syntactic process.
First, the base need not itself be capable of functioning as a fixed
adverbial. Thus làpà 'year' is not a temporal modifier but kipà 1àpà 'year
after year' is. The same is true of vu gá and its reduplication.( 2 4 0 ) * ßa       ri     ε-νυ             vu     gá

pause between the parts. In some cases such as tfitfirì 'silently' (possibly
related to tfirì 'silent') it is not clear whether the form is reduplicated or
not. Third, tonal patterns in these reduplicated forms resemble the tonal
patterns of lexical items (see 3.5.2.6).
   The reduplicated form can itself be reduplicated again. In the doubly
reduplicated form the tonal change marks the plurality, with (the
pragmatically odd) several things killed several times.(242)     má      mgbà     à?l    kpó      kpó

this is most likely to be a shortened form of áni 'like' (ie. we do not
consider it to be related to the /¿required after arguments, 12.1.3). (244)    ká   id Blu         d$ó     (I3Ó      m

1.6.   Ma'di in print and on the radioPrinted material in Ma'di is scarce and where there is any it is hard to
come by. Possibly the only general published works in Ma'di are
missionary publications such as the translation of the New Testament, and
prayer and song booklets by the Catholic missionaries. We have heard
that the missions of Arua diocese have some publications in Ma'di. The
Ma'di Ethnic and Heritage Welfare Association in Britain publishes a
quarterly bilingual (English and Ma'di) paper called Ma'di Lelego. The
texts we include at the end of this grammar were collected on behalf of
this association, which we thank. We can best represent the situation of
Ma'di on the radio by saying that in Spring 1998, Radio Uganda made
the following regular broadcasts in Ma'di (all programmes except
'Listeners' Favorite' last 15 minutes). (Daily) News in Ma'di, Religious
Program, Veterans' Assistance Board (Program for laid off soldiers),
Talk Show (general topic), Ma'di Guest, Ma'di Traditional Music,
Calling Farmers, Women's Program, Family Life Education, Health
Program, Listeners' Favorite (Greetings).
6    Introduction
1.6.1. Orthography A standard orthography was adopted following the recommendations of
 the Rejaf Language Conference of 1928. The policy then was to admit
 representative languages to be taught in schools. From the Eastern
 Sudanic languages were chosen Zande, Mora, Ma'di, Kreish and Ndogo
 (Tucker 1940:36). The rest of the languages were left to die. Government
 textbooks were supposed to be issued in these languages to be used in the
 schools. Subsequently Sir James Robertson, who succeded Sir Douglas
 Newbold as the Civil Secretary, reversed in 1946 the policy of his
predecessor which hitherto regarded South Sudan as a different social
 and political entity from Northern Sudan. This reversal saw the last
 governmental attempt to develop orthographies for the languages of the
 South Sudan, as the North has been hostile to them and has preferred the
promotion of Arabic. From around 1987 The Summer Institute of
Linguistics (SIL) started work on the orthography of the language
culminating in the production of a primer in 1992; SIL member Kilpatrick
(1985) also has suggestions for an orthography.
    The standard orthography for Ma'di omits tones and uses the five
vowels (a, e, i, o, u), thus ignoring ATR distinctions in the vowels. The
SEL suggestion for ATR differentiation is to place a dot below a vowel (a
e i o or u) to mark it as +ATR; without a dot the vowel is -ATR.
Kilpatrick suggests as an alternative placing a colon before the word with
+ATR vowels. In this grammar, following Lojenga 1994, we use different
symbols for +ATR vowels (λ e i o u) and -ATR (a ε i ο υ) vowels. This
is our only deviation from the IPA symbols we otherwise use, and we do
this for visual clarity.
    For the tones, the SIL practice is as follows: Low vowels are marked
with a tilde over the vowel, high vowels with an acute accent, and mid
vowels are not marked with a diacritic. Kilpatrick suggests additionally
marking mid vowels with a circumflex or umlaut. In this grammar we
mark low vowels with a grave accent (à), mid vowels with a macron (ä),
and high vowels with an acute accent (á).
    Glottal stops are indicated in the standard orthography by an
apostrophe, as in 'a for ?a 'stomach'. Implosive ('preglottalized')
consonants are marked in the standard orthography by putting an
apostrophe before the consonant, as 'ba, for fia 'to put; home'. Hence
the language name màdi is written Ma'di. The palatal nasal [p] is written
ny, hence pä is written nya. These orthographic practices are adopted also
by the SIL. We use IPA symbols for all consonants in this grammar.

There are two main dialects of Ma'di; the Northern and the Southern
dialects, which have subdivisions within them. This is a probable
breakdown of dialects:

which a mixed group of 'Burulo, Lokai and Ugandan Ma'di speakers
each speak in their own dialect). This is a grammar of Lokai Ma'di; we
occasionally comment on differences between Lokai and 'Burulo or

6.1.2. Plural native nouns : characteristic tone, or suppletion6.1.2.1. The distinctive tonal pattern of some native plural nounsMost nouns do not have a distinctive plural form. The nouns which do are
primarily nouns of gender, age, kinship and occupation; these have
morphologically distinct plural forms with a characteristic tonal pattern,
and in some cases also a suffix. Other than these, it is rare for nouns to be
differentiated morphologically for number. Crazzarola (1960: 17) shows
that similarly in Logbara kinship terms are the only nouns which
pluralize, often with a plural suffix el, though Logbara has a regular plural
suffix for these words which Ma'di does not.
                                                                              Nouns   99

"   The head noun (the modified noun) may be omitted in all cases where
there is postmodification. The presence or absence of the head noun does
not affect the interpretation or the syntactic distribution of the noun

"A pronoun can be a postmodifier. It can also take ?/, which strongly
suggests that it is being interpreted as a predicate in this case (ie. as a
subordinate nonverbal clause with a null subject). The option of taking ?1

"12.7. Demonstrative phrases
There are three demonstratives:
  dì         speaker-proximal     'this'
  ni         distal               'that'
  ìlédì      hearer-proximal      'that near you'
The demonstratives can be combined with a preceding noun (a full
demonstrative phrase) or can stand on their own (a bare demonstrative
phrase). The demonstrative phrase refers to an entity which is in the
immediate physical context. It cannot be used to refer to an entity which
exists only in the discourse context (in which case one of the other
determiners is used, such as noma). Thus the the cup in (101) must be
physically present though it might also have been talked about: physical
presence overrides discourse topicality in requiring a deictic rather than n.(101)     kubajà dì         péléré
          cup       this clean (S)
           'This cup is clean.'(102)     o-mü     basì nà        sì
          3-go     bus that SR
          'She went in that bus.'
The only case we know of a referent not in the physical context is in an
idiomatic expression:(103)     fl-eße m          má drt nà        hjgónì
          2s-leave woman Is POSS that how
          'How was your wife when you left.' (literally: 'How did you
          leave that woman of mine?')
The demonstratives have only singular reference. If a number of
individuals is referred to, they are referred to as a single group.

12.8. rf-phrase (distal discourse determiner ri)
iì is one of the two Ma'di words best translated by definite articles; the
other is nâ. Both refer back to entities which have been previously
mentioned in the discourse. The ri-phrase refers back to an entity which
has been discussed in the more distant previous discourse (ie. it is distal);
we tend to gloss it as 'the .. in question'. If the entity has very recently
been mentioned, nä 'the aforementioned' is used instead.
    A lì phrase exists only as a 'full' phrase, in that it must be combined
with other, preceding, material - whether a noun or a modifier; η cannot
stand on its own. ii phrases are open to different kinds of interpretation,
depending on whether the phrase contains a modifier. If there is no
modifier, the ri phrase is interpreted as definite but non-specific. The
referred-to entity or entities must have been previously discussed (ie.
definite) but the specific identity of the entity is not important (ie. non-
specific). It is possible to combine the ri phrase with the LOW determiner
to force a specific interpretation on it; because the LOW determiner is
absorbed into the low tone of ri, other factors such as distributional
restrictions must tell us that this is the structure for specific phrases'.
280       Noun phrases   We note that Logbara has a determiner ri, and agree with Djuruni's
(1983: 128-129) analysis of η as relating to discourse topicality. We do
not agree with Crazzarola's analysis of η (Crazzarola 1960: 27) which is
that it is a 'relative pronoun suffix'. However, we think there might be
some justification in Crazzarola's suggestion that it is analogous to
Acholi ma 'which' (Crazzarola 1960: 56).
   It has been suggested to us that a ri-phrase might mean 'an
aforementioned' with an indefinite determiner ri which is obligatorily
associated with a null adjective 'aforementioned'.","[294, 295, 296]"

3.5.   Tones3.5.1. Inventory of tones3.5.1.1. Level tonesPhonemically, there are three level tones: high, mid and low.  sa   'tail'
  sä   'to plant, to scour'
  sa   'to intervene and bring a fight etc. to an end'Tones are contextually unrestricted in occurrence: all tones appear on all
vowels after all consonants. There is thus no interaction of consonant
voicing and tone in sä 'to plant, to scour' vs. zá 'to defeat, to pain'.
38       Phonetics3.5.1.2. Contour tones: all arise by sandhiThere may be no underlying (phonemic) contour tones. High-Low tonal
sequences are found in some words.      kpo           'all'
      sa""           'time, clock, watch' (from arabic); also 'even'However, these may be interpreted not as contour tones but as involving
two syllables rather than one. Evidence for this is that the vowels in these
'contour' cases are always longer.      kpó.ò           'all'In some cases, a High-Low sequence on a single lengthened vowel is a
variant of a word with a High Low sequence on two syllables:(1)            tebe     —>     te
                'earlier in the day'(2)            ban             ba~

                'my'The first two shortened forms occur freely for most speakers in both fast
speech and slow speech; the last only in fast speech.
   There are no corresponding examples of Low-High contour sequences
on what appears to be a single syllable, with the possible exception of the
word máátfiká 'a sorghum species'.
   In addition to these cases of contours which arise by internal vowel-
deletion rules there are contours which arise by external vowel-deletion
rules. Thus there are various grammatical morphemes which are realized
by a floating low tone, and these combine with a preceding high tone to
produce an apparent High-Low contour on a single lengthened vowel.(4)           jii             mü           —»    pf   mü

nouns. Monosyllabic verbs have mid or low tone, but not high tone (the
same is true for Logbara according to Crazzarola 1960: 10).","[53, 54, 55]"
"There is apparent optionality when the noun phrase contains a
demonstrative or the determiner n. In these cases, ni is sometimes used
and sometimes not. However, we argue in 12.10.1 that this optionality is
only apparent and that in these phrases the presence of ni is a result of the
syntactic presence of a phonologically concealed LOW determiner.
    We propose that ni and pi are pronominale and the noun phrase is pre-
adjoined to them. This is the same as our analysis of ?i, and resembles the
relation between the adjoined subject and the true pronominal subject of a
verb. We suggest that ni might possibly be related to the 'default' (NS
paradigm) third person singular pronoun äni (6.4.3). We note that ?i

Sudanic languages, with conclusions which we take to be more or less
along the same lines. Thus Crazzarola (1960: 43) says that Logbara ni
""refers back to a noun in the sentence or to an object in the view or in the
mind of the speaker, especially when it is the object of some
postposition"" And Lojenga (1994) says that Ngiti ni (a cognate?) is a
'resumptive marker', whose function is ""to resume the noun or noun
phrase after a brief pause which gives it slightly more emphasis"". There
is in contrast no pause in Ma'di between the noun phrase and nl.
    It is worth noting that there is another Ma'di word nl which is used to
express indefinite possession; it is preceded by an indefinite and is part of
an indefinite noun phrase. We discuss this in 13.1.1.1, where we suggest
that this is an unrelated word which is related instead to the benefactive
postposition ni.","[279, 280, 281]"

6.6.2. Adverbials which resemble adjectives
Some adverbials are homophonous with adjectives. Thus for example the
adverbial losó 'well' is homophonous with the adjective losó 'good'. In
some cases the homophonous pairs are made of reduplicated members,
for example tfé tfé means both 'slowly' and 'slow'. This fits a general
pattern whereby adverbials tend to have a reduplicated structure. Some
adjectives exist in singular and plural forms, but the adverbs are
homophonous with the singular forms and do not pluralize.(93)    opi    pi        pelere

4.1.8. Optional ATR harmony involving the reflexive pronoun ruThe reflexive pronoun w harmonizes optionally to the ATR value of the
adjacent verb, whether that verb immediately precedes or immediately

likely when w precedes the verb, and less likely when w follows the verb.
The following four examples show harmony. Note that in (13) w must

4.2.   Vowel assimilation and vowel deletionA vowel preceding another vowel may delete or assimilate to the later
vowel, particularly in fast speech. There are three contexts in which vowel
assimilation or deletion occurs, involving (i) the final vowel of a pronoun,
(ii) preceding a vowel-initial verb, or (iii) the final vowel of a possessive
pronoun preceding a vowel-initial noun. The only apparent case of
deletion of the second rather than the first of two vowels is seen in the
words nani 'like that', d'ini 'like this', and ileni 'like that (near the
hearer)', which are variants of nà ani, dì ani and ìlédì an?respectively.","[68, 69]"

"Like postmodification by a bare indefinite noun, this use of zi is possible
only when the determiner is π or nâ, and not when it is a demonstrative. It
might be asked whether this is in fact a case of double determination, with
the specific determiner zi followed by the definite determiner π or nâ.
However, evidence that this is indeed a postmodification structure with zi
as a postmodifier comes from the fact that the n-phrases are ambiguously
definite or indefinite, and the nä-phrase is only indefinite. This is a pattern
we see when there is a modifier in the phrase.
   A bare demonstrative cannot be a postmodifier, eg. * dì η 'the this
one', but this might be because there is an incompatibility between the
physical context interpretation of the demonstrative and the discourse
context interpretation of n.",[321]
"12.2.1.     The distinctive syntactic characteristics of bare indefinitesThe bare indefinite noun phrase is distinctively different from most other
types of noun phrase in its syntactic distribution. It can be a predicate on
its own, and it need not and in fact cannot be adjoined to the predicating
morpheme ?1. These are characteristics shared only with some of the bare
determiners. The bare indefinite noun phrase also has a distributional
characteristic following from its being indefinite: it cannot co-occur with
plural la"" (14.1.2.2). And because it is nonspecific it is not adjoined to
grammatical m (12.1.3).(47)       ma       dje       gan
            IS      buy       bicycle

            'Goats are eating grain.'
12.3. zi-phrase (with the indefinite determiner zi)The word zi can appear in the following kinds of zi-phrase:
  (a)     on its own
  (b)     followed by nä
  (c)     preceded by a noun
  (d)     preceded by a noun and followed by ni
The zi phrase is interpreted either as (a) indefinite and specific,
translatable into English as 'a certain N', or (b) indefinite but not

necessarily specific, translatable into English as 'another N \ In both
cases, the entity referred to is not intended to be recoverable from the
physical or discourse context. The full zi-phrase has only singular
reference, while the bare zi-phrase has singular or plural reference.(49)     ago     zi   e-d3i              m

"6.1.1.2. The tone of singular derived abstract nounsAbstract nouns are derived productively from adjectives or from nouns

analogous to English -ness and -hood nouns respectively. They have a
characteristic M*L tonal pattern.

    Abstract nouns can also be derived from derived adjectives which have
themselves been formed by reduplicating an adjective. Thus in addition to
the noun äli 'shortness', from the adjective àii 'short', there is also a
noun añali which also means 'shortness' and is probably derived from
aliali 'shortish'. There is also a noun aliali which means 'the shorter
one(s) from a set of short ones'(1)       ali          ali               ή         und^i
          short (S) short(s)             DEF       bad (S)

         short (S) short ones            DEF      bad (S)
          'The shorter ones from a set of short ones are bad.' (with some
         uniform badness)(3)      ali          áñ                 π        önd^l

          'The shorter ones from a set of short ones are bad.' (with
         varying kinds or levels of badness)Other adjectives and related nouns give rise to similar words. Thus for
example iggwe iggwe is a noun meaning 'the whiter ones from a set of
white ones'; pèlèré pélërë a noun meaning 'the cleaner ones from a set
of clean ones'. It is possible that these are nominalizations of the
reduplicated adjective forms such as àiiàli with only the second part of the
reduplicated form changing its category to give an adjective-noun
combination.","[113, 114]"

11.6. The use of dru with a nonverbal predicate11.6.1.    The word druWe propose that the predicate-taking dru should more precisely be
represented as drö (ie. with a high floating tone at the beginning), and is
realized as either dru or as dru depending on the tone of the preceding
word (4.3.3.2).
                                            The use of diu with a nonverbal predicate   253    There is a homophone drû ('bare dru') which does not take a
complement and means 'with it' (15.13.2). This can lead to ambiguities
in some cases (the (b) readings in the examples below, where we have
bare drû and an instrumental interpretation).
    The drû phrase is best interpreted as having a predicate pre-adjoined to
it, and as always having a covert subject. When the nominal predicate is
pre-adjoined to drû it characterizes a set of entities which are analogous to
the entity represented by the noun phrase.(203)     ß-olu           lapwopi                                  ra

10.2.1.4.     A possible case of a noun phrase subject in a re clauseThere is one situation in which a suffixed clause can have a noun phrase
as subject, rather than the general situation in which an overt subject must
be in a postposition phrase. This situation is illustrated by the following
example. The subject must be a nä phrase and is non-agentive, and thus
somewhat object-like.(17)    dì   ágó          ά     nä     ëgwè-rë         dì        π       ?1
        this man        [ c o w AFR    (N)-get lost-SB COM     ] DEF     FOC
            (a) 'This is the man whose cow got lost'
            (b)* 'This is the man who lost his cow.'",[211]
"The construction is found with demonstratives and zi, and in both cases it
is possible for the determiner to be preceded by a noun as well.(164)      ßa         nà           ßa""                  ögü

"This does not however prove that the adverbial is a noun; it could be the
final part of a very stripped-down relative clause and thus not directly
related to the definite article.
    Other adverbials such as oßu 'tomorrow' can be attached to the
pronominal rìì or to determiners, which are both characteristics of nouns.
However, in the former case, attachment to ni would suggest that oßu is
being treated as a name (not as a common noun), as names attach to nl
and common nouns do not; this fits with the sense that oßu is being
personified.(99)       Ò6Ó                  m      ò-nì           rü        kü
            tomorrow            PR     3-know         REFL NEG(N)
            'Nobody knows tomorrow.' (perhaps with some
            personification of tomorrow)oßu can also take the specificity (floating low tone) determiner (and is
then followed, as expected for this determiner, by ni). It is less easy here
to see what the syntax of the phrase is; the specificity determiner does not
normally take preceding modifiers and normally combines only with a
preceding common noun, which suggests that there is indeed something
noun-like about oßu.(100)      οδό           ""    m         àjgóm

"There are two possible explanations. One is that the subordinate clause is
treated as the noun phrase because Jtá-clauses do show noun phrase like
characteristics, and is followed by na as the determiner. Another
possibility is that nä expresses an argument within the subordinate clause.
We have no analysis of this at present.
    Some light is possibly cast on this by comparison with Ugandan
Ma'di. nain Ugandan Madi differs from na in Lokai Ma'di in two ways:
(a) it can lose [n], (b) it must be followed by ni. This is the case both for
the determiner nä (preceded by a noun) and for the nä we see here; this
strongly suggests that it is the same morpheme in both cases.

15.6.2.1.       What is (rí)í ?(n)t superficially resembles the pronominal ni in that it mediates between
certain types of noun phrase and a particular position. But (n)i is
probably not a version of ni. The main reason for thinking this is that it is
                                                       ni : benefactive 381
required after non-specific π-phrases, a place where ni is not required.
   However, (n)i is not obviously a postposition either. If (n)i was a
postposition then gá would be taking a PP complement when it takes a
(n)i-complement; but gá can take no other postposition phrase as a
complement. (n)i also differs from the postposition ni (whose nasal
cannot be lost) in that ni does not have a definiteness constraint on its
complement.(119)   àm-e-dsi        (I3Ó             ni
         LPL-VE-take    house      SPEC BEN
         'We have brought it for the/her house'   Thus the category of (n)i remains something of a puzzle as to its
category. It is worth noting that there is some evidence that all
postpositions are preceded by a floating high tone, perhaps depending on
context, and that this high tone causes tone raising on some preceding
grammatical words. This can be seen also for drü (4.3.3.2) in all
contexts. It is also worth speculating whether ni and i are versions
(allomorphs) of the high tone which may be present before other
postpositions when they take certain complements.

basically means 'temporary location at or movement towards', and ni
basically means 'for the benefit o f . (Each word also has a range of other
382       Postposition phrases and other location expressionsmeanings.) Thus we endorse Crazzarola's (1960: 52) comments on the
distinction between dn and ni in Logbara: ""Again and again the following
idea was expressed to the author, while others seem to deny it: ni would
imply some idea of ownership or the intention of giving something as
such, dri does not imply anything of the kind."" ni can be used with the
object of a verb of telling, teaching, etc., but dn cannot be used in this case
because the movement or possession is not temporary.(123)       ma / o opi      ni                    adute

There is no Ma'di word for zero. None of the ten numerals are
recognizably loanwords. Apart from Ma'di, some of the other Central
Sudanic languages have a quinary structure (Tucker 1940:287) in which
only 1-5 are monomorphemes, and 6-10 are compounds involving five.
This is not really true for Ma'di though there are two possible exceptions.
'Seven' tùùdëri might have originated as a compound tòu + èri, five +
two, and dritfàlû 'nine' might have originated as dri + tfà + àlû, hand +
reach + one, meaning 'one hand short'; both of these might imply some
relation to a five-based system. Crazzarola (1960: 38) comments on the
fact that Ma'di and Logbara are unusual in having ten distinct numerals.","[144, 145]"
"If the clause is fronted, the ?i is lost and jà is optional. In this case, we
assume that the fronting of the clause is sufficient to focus it.(145)      tà     dì 5-Bà rü         iggónì (jà)nì     má m   kü

6.4.1.4. Tense and modalityDistinct pronominal paradigms correlate with different kinds of tense,
aspect and modality, and interact also indirectly with negation. The
distinction between past and nonpast sentences, which has implications
also for aspect, involves distinct pronominal paradigms, the I-paradigm
and the U-paradigm (along with other differences in the verb and its
arguments). Directive sentences have their own pronominal paradigm, the
D-paradigm.

6.4.1.5. Meanings not coded by pronouns in Ma' diThe following meanings and functions are not coded by distinctions in
the pronominal system:
(a) Gender.
(b) Tribal, sectional or family relationships.
(c) Status or relations between participants.
(d) Discourse prominence. Note however that determiners are sensitive to
    discourse prominence, with η being the definite determiner used for
    coreferents in the distal discourse and na being used for coreferents in
    the proximal discourse; these two determiners cannot be used on their
    own as noun phrases.
(e) Emphasis or degrees of emphasis. It is worth noting that the long vs.
    short pronoun distinction in pronoun subjects of uninflected verbs
    does not correlate with a difference in emphasis.
(f) Proximity to the participants in the speech act. However this is coded
    by demonstratives, by some postposition modifiers, and also by the
    ventive verbal prefix e-.
(g) Logophoricity. Ma'di does not have logophoric pronouns (unlike,
    apparently, Ngiti).","[124, 125]"

To my late dad, Tadeo Nduru and my mother Malyamu Yakobo Yanga
who in between them spoke more languages than I would ever. I would
also like to dedicate this work to the family of my late brother in law,
Jospeh Kebulu MP whose tragedy typified that of many Ma'dis both in
the Sudan and in Uganda at the turn of the last century. Joseph Kebulu
was dragged out of a public bus while on an election campaign and shot
in full view of the rest of the passengers and in broad day light. His
widowed wife, my sister, Cecilia Kebulu was blown to pieces when a
hound hit her during the numerous shellings of Juba. Their son, John
Kebulu, 'disappeared' when he was picked up by the security forces for
interrogations in Juba and nothing was heard of him since then.","[4, 5]"
