"  1.8. Case marking. Languages with verbs that predominately follow
both the subject and the object almost always have a case system (Greenberg
1966:113). An ergative-absolutive case system identifies the major clause
constituents of Epena Pedee.®
  The subject of a transitive clause is always marked by an ergative or
cause suffix (see §5.1). The ergative suffix -a is used with singular pronouns
and the marked plural pronoun (i.e., taci-a, 4ci-a, paci-a; see §4.13).(22)   mi-a      p*ita         k'o-hi
       I-ERG plantain eat-PST
       I ate the plantain.",[25]
"  The pronoun a-gée ‘same-kind’ is used to refer to the same kind of item
being talked about, as illustrated in (261).(261) ne-Panimaél       éak'e tnu ata-k'ari mi-a            iidi-hi      na

       When I saw the insect, I asked, “Is this a centipede?” “It’s of the
       same class,” she said.

                                           Case  The case markers of Epena Pedee are postpositional clitics that have a
specific meaning when they mark the ergative, absolutive, and dative
constituents of the clause; they also have a more general meaning, how-
ever, when        they are attached to other clausal constituents. These markers
occur on the last word of a noun phrase and also on the verb (last word)
of relative clauses (see §9.9-9.12).
  Similar ergative-absolutive systems are found in other languages of the
Chocé language family, e.g. Catio (Rex 1975:38-40) and Embera (Ras-
mussen and Mestia 1985:115-117).”°
  This chapter discusses the markers of the ergative, absolutive, and dative
constituents of the clause as they fit respectively into the broader uses of
their   markers      as   cause,   absolutive,       and   inherent    goal,    as     well   as   the
markers of other constituents of a clause including external goal, posses-
sion and composition,          accompaniment,           location, direction and origin and,
finally, comparison.","[80, 81]"
"  4.13. Personal pronouns. There are two sets of personal pronouns in
Epena Pedee, an unmarked and a marked set (those which have the suffix

(229), the ergative morphemes, -pa and -a, are shown in parentheses with
their corresponding pronoun. The unmarked plural pronouns use -pa; the
rest use -a. All other case markers are consistent irregardless of the
pronoun.","[73, 74]"

  Epena Pedee Syntax
  Studies in the Languages of Colombia 4  Publicatious in Liuguistics Number 118     Epena Pedee is a language of Colombia, spoken by approx-
  imately 3500 people, and classified as a member of the Southern
  Emberé dialect cluster of the Choc6é language family. Epena
  Pedee Syntax details the major grammatical structures of the
  language, from morphology through discourse, with an introduc-
  tory sketch of its basic phonological characteristics (including
  suprasegmental nasalization). Epena Pedee is an ergative-absolu-
  tive language, but one in which the notion of subject plays an
  important role, as demonstrated by the fact that it is the subject
  which manifests number agreement with the verb. The basic word
  order of the language is SOV (or: subject-object-verb), with the
  typical ordering patterns typologically expected of such languages
  largely manifested. (Within the noun phrase some modifiers
  precede the noun and others follow.) With extensive examples,
  and discussion presented in an atheoretical framework, Epena
  Pedee Syntax is a readily accessible source of information on this
  little known language.","[223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230]"
"
   6Similar case-marking systems are found in other members of the Chocd language
family (Rex 1975:38-40; Sanchez, Castro and Binder 1977:128-35). See further
discussion in chapter 5.
10                                                                        Epena Pedee Syntax  The suffix -pa is used with all other constructions including unmarked
pronouns (i.e., t4i-pa, dra-pa, para-pa) as illustrated in (23).(23)       usd-pa_ ethérre pee-hi
           dog-ERG chicken kill-PST
           The dog killed a chicken.","[25, 26]"
"   5.2. Absolutive. The absolutive case is not marked. It is usually the first
noun phrase to the left of the verb in a simple SOV clause. The absolutive
¢ik’é-ra ‘many fish’ in (266) has no overt case marker as is the case with
the absolutive (in this case the subject of an intransitive clause) imama
‘tiger’ in (267).(266) ricé-pa      ¢ik""6-ra          héo      atee-hi
         tich-ERG fish-many“CMPR cook take-PST
         The rich man cooked a lot of food and took it with him.(267) iméma k'eward-ra             pa-te-hi
         tiger | afternoon-CMPR     arrive-come-PST
         A tiger came later on.
Case                                                                       67
   5.3. Inherent goal. -mda (or -md-a (location-dative)) indicates the da-
tive of bitransitive clauses, goal of verbs of motion, progression in verbs,
and the sense of ‘upon’ in adverbial clauses. It thus has a generalized
meaning of inherent goal.
   Inherent goal deals with the point of predication (Longacre 1983;163),
whereas external goal (marked with -it’ée; next section) deals with goals
other than those of the point of predication.
   The dative case is indicated by -md-a, -4, or simply vowel lengthening
and stress on the final syllable of the noun phrase. In (268), nawe ‘mother’,
the recipient or goal, is marked by -md-a.(268)   warrd-pa p’4ta__tee-hi     Ci   nawe-ma-a
        son-ERG plantain give-PST REF mother-LOC-DAT
        The boy gave the plantain to his mother.","[82, 83]"
"     1.12. Relative clauses. The relative clause in Epena Pedee has an inter-
nal head;    the noun      phrase,    which   acts as a head    of the relative clause,
occurs in its normal position within the restricting clause, which in turn
bears any case markers that normally would mark the noun phrase. In (47),
the ergative case marker -pa, which would normally follow the last word
of the noun      phrase,    follows the verb       of the relative clause; the relative
clause is enclosed in brackets and the head noun is in bold.
Introduction                                                                 15

       He said, “His eyes will become healed with these two eggs that I
       have.”","[30, 31]"
"
     The    absence   of an   absolutive    affix is more     common   than   the   presence   of one
among ergative-absolutive systems (Givon 1984:151).
Introduction                                                                              11
   As can be seen from these examples and taking into consideration the
identification of the ergative case with the subject of a transitive clause and
the absolutive case with object, Epena Pedee constituent order is SOV.
   Examples (28)-(36) give the basic order of elements in various construc-
tions.
   A copular clause has the order (the verb is optional): Absolutive(sub-
ject)—Complement—Verb.","[26, 27]"
"  6.29, Irrealis. The irrealis mood suffix -i-k’4 ‘might-like’ (-ik'4 or -isk*4,
for some speakers) indicates possible or potential results as shown in (498).(498) mi-4    _ p""arat*a tee-i-k""4         a-hi
       me-DAT silver    _give-might-like say-PST

                                Clause   In this chapter the elements of the clause are discussed. Section 7.1
provides a discussion of the normal order of the constituents within a
declarative clause; §§7.2-7.7 consider the formation of interrogative
clauses; §§7.8-7.11 give a description of imperative clauses; and §§7.12-
7.17 give a description of negation. ©  7.1. Order of clause constituents. Typically a clause contains pre-
verbal constituents (subject and/or direct object), the verb phrase, and
post-verbal constituents (oblique phrases including the dative). In the
examples of this section, constituents are separated with a slash (/).
  Constituent order has a significant role in identifying the function of
clause constituents. Clause (499) is particularly illustrative of this point
because it is an equative copular and the nouns are not marked for case.
The first element is the subject and the second is the predicate.(499) carlos / josé ak*ére | pa-hi

"                             2.1-2.9 Open classes  2.1. Nouns. Nouns typically refer to concrete objects or things (animate
beings or inanimate entities), are either common or proper, and function
as the heads of arguments.!!
   Nouns may have no suffixes or may be inflected for case and number.
The noun warra ‘son’ of (59) is inflected by -r4 (plural animate) and by
-pa (ergative, cause).(59)   warra-ré-pa k'awédo           pee-hi-da

      §.7-5.11 Postpositional markers       of location, direction, and origin     Location    in   Epena   Pedee   may   be   specified   by    means   of adverbs,
postpositional words, or noun phrases marked by the enclitics -de, -da,
-ma, or -mai. Noun phrases with a locative clitic may have additional
markers indicating movement toward (lengthening of the final vowel),
movement away from (-pa with vowel lengthening of the preceding vowel),
or origin (-péma). Most nouns have no morphophonemic changes when
the clitics foilow them; these are the regular nouns. Irregular nouns are few
in number and may (depending on the noun phrase)                           have   mor-
phophonemic changes when the locative clitics follow them.
Case                                                                     71
   Each of the different ways of expressing location, direction, and origin
mentioned above is discussed in the following sections. Within each sec-
tion, the discussion takes the order of the major divisions illustrated in
(287)—(291).","[86, 87]"
     In the remainder of this paper the absolutive case is not indicated.,[26]
"   The object of a transitive clause and the subject of an intransitive clause
are generally not marked by an overt case suffix. In (24) and (25), the
absence of an overt case marker is indicated by -@, glossed as absolutive

  1.10. Suffixes. All affixes in Epena Pedee are suffixes; there are no
prefixes.? Nouns can be marked by suffixes of case and number. Verbs may
have suffixes of aspect, tense, number, and mood. This is characteristic of
a typical SOV language. Suffixes modifying nouns and verbs are illustrated
in (37)-(39).(37)   warra-ra-pa Cik""6-ra                pee-hi-dé        to      éak'é-de

   -Pit""ée may mark a noun phrase or adjective phrase as being the item to
fulfill   a need   and, hence, the reason for the action. In (277), the bison’s
skin is marked as the reason. In (278), -7it""ée modifies an adjective phrase
which indicates the reason.(277)     eperaa-ra-pa   _pee-pa-ti-da__bisonte ¢i__e-Pitée

"     Honorific forms are often used to indicate masculine, whereas diminutive
forms serve for feminine. However, this is not always the case; the child in
(113) is actually a male; the diminutive form of the verb is used because
of his size.!4 (114) illustrates the use of the plural honorific form éitoona.",[48]

standard and the element with which it is being compared.",[95]
"   When there is no change of location of the subject (in this case because
the subject is different in the adverbial clauses and the main clause), no
directional verb or suffix is used. In (389), mi ‘T (the speaker), is the one
who changed location, not t4¢i ak'dre ‘God’.

                               Introduction  1.1, Language affiliation. Epéra Pedée! (literally ‘person words’) is
spoken by approximately 3,500 people who live on the Pacific coastal rivers
of the departments of Narifio, Cauca, and Valle de Cauca Colombia. A
major grouping of Epena is located in Cauca on the Saija river and three
of its major   tributaries,   the   Guangii,   Infi, and   Cupi.   There   are   smaller
communities on the Laguna and Satinga rivers of Narifio and on the Micay
and Bubuey rivers of Cauca. There are several communities on the lower
San Juan river and one on the Dagua river that are composed of people
who speak Wounaan (the predominant language of the area), others who
speak primarily Epena Pedee, and still others that speak both languages.
Social contact and intermarriage is common between the Wounaan from
these areas and Epena. People who marry and move into the other
language area usually learn to communicate in the other language. Those
who are not bilingual in the languages communicate using Spanish.
  An Epena dialect is spoken also on the Basurud6 river near the
Docampadé river in the Department of the Chocd. Only the Basurud6
dialect differs significantly from the others. Numerous families are also
found scattered throughout the coastal area among the black population.
   Epena Pedee is a member of the Southern Embera dialect cluster of the
Chocé language family. Other related languages include Embera (Sambu),
Catio, Chami, Wounaan,        and languages from the Baudé, Tad6, San Jorge,
Verde, and Sucio rivers. Loewen           (1963:244—46)    believes these to be of
  ‘Hereafter written Epena Pedee when referring to the language or Epena when
referring to the people, for the convenience of nonnative speakers.

referred to by linguists using the names of the rivers along which they are
spoken. Epena Pedee has therefore been referred to as Saija because the
major portion of its speakers live in the Saija river area.
   The Epena people often use the word sia to distinguish themselves from
other indigenous people of the coast. The meaning of this word as it
relates to the people sia piddara or the language sia pedée is uncertain.
The principal meaning of the word sia is ‘wild cane’, a plant that looks
similar to sugarcane and grows near the edge of rivers. Secondary mean-
ings are ‘arrow’ (which is made from the flower stem of the sia plant) and
pedée sia (which refers to an enjoyable or friendly chat). There is also
some similarity between the name of the river Saija and the word sia.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
"  2.16. Enclitics. Clitics in Epena Pedee are phonologically bound to the
word that they follow. Case markers (chapter 5) are clitics, in that they are
phonologically bound to the last word of the noun phrase, yet relate to the
whole phrase. The negative morpheme -7é (§§7.12-7.17) may also be
bound to words from a number of grammatical classes.(127) verbs                  pee-2é pa-hi         ‘did not kill’
      nouns                  usa-Pé               ‘not a dog’

        clauses              wa-hi-?e-k4?         ‘did he not leave?’  The enclitic -pai ‘only’ modifies other words such as numerals              (128),
adverbs (129) and verbs (130).(128)   aba-pdi

"  As is the case in many languages, the initial reference to a new par-
ticipant is usually in the post-verb position of a sentence. (In addition, a
previously introduced participant is reintroduced in the same way in Epena
Pedee.) In (748), from a story of two brothers on a hunting trip, the new
participants first appear in the post-verb position.(748) ma      p'éta       cuu-mda_         bi-de       &e-hi-da        eperaa-ra

"  The completive suffix -da, subordinate clause past tense suffix -da
(8§9.5-9.6, and 9.9-9.12), and declarative quotation mood suffix -da
($6.21) all share the common element of perfectivity. The distinguishing
factor is the kind of clause in which -da is used, which also affects the
kinds of suffixes that occur with -da. When -da occurs with a main verb, a
dependent clause verb, or an adjective, it implies the completion of an
event. In such cases, the appropriate tense, number, and dependent clause
suffixes also occur. When -da occurs in a subordinate or relative clause
construction, past tense perfectivity is implied. These forms occur with a
distinct plural suffix, -p""eda, and appropriate suffixes indicating subordina-
tion. When -da functions as a mood suffix, it is part of the quotation
construction and by nature must be perfective.",[125]
"  5.1. Cause.       -pa   marks    agent   in        transitive   clauses,     instrument,         and
reason,     and    thus has    a generalized          meaning     of ‘cause’;        -pa   (with   the  In      both of those languages, the subject of transitive clauses is marked by -ba. In
Catio, objects of transitive clauses and subjects of intransitive clauses are marked                by
-ta (-ra if previously mentioned), Rex glosses this as nominative (1975:39). In Embera,
-da marks the subject of an intransitive clause and the object of a transitive clause if
it is new information (-ra if previously mentioned). The dative of both is marked by
“4.",[81]
"   Further evidence of an internal head is that postpositional case markers
occur not on the head noun but at the end of the restrictive clause. In
(681), the noun phrase epera wéra ‘the Epena woman’ does not have the
ergative marker -pa because it is syntactically a constituent of the relative
clause rather than the main clause. The ergative marker instead modifies
the entire relative clause (see Comrie 1981:138).(681) fepéra     wéra       t'ot'do0 biJ-pa_         k'4wa ata-hi

subject is not overtly marked for case (and thus is absolutive).(70)     josé k'ai-hi

"  With a few irregular nouns, such as te ‘house’ (293), to ‘river’ (294), and
tu ‘ground’ (295), the locative marker -de is manifest as -da and the
irregular forms tée ‘house’ or tdi ‘river’ precede -da.(293) mi nék’o      — tée-da       bi

of the final vowel of -mdi, because it ends in a sequence of two vowels.(321)   ée-hi     mi-éi te-mai-pa

"  4.17. Spatial deictic pronouns. There are two spatial deictic pronouns
in Epena Pedee, aé4 ‘this one (here)’ and acd ‘that one (there)’. These
function like demonstratives but usually only occur when accompanied by
gestures. The pronoun ac4 tends to occur with the stative verb bi ‘be’. In
(256), an agouti has been caught by a mother tiger. In order to get her to
release him, he tells her that what she has hold of is a stick and that this
(gesture) is his real foot. aé4 bi may occur as a shortened form, éa, as
illustrated in (257).(256) hé-gi         — pak'urii-da a-hi        ada       bi-ta   mi biiri-da

        “That is a stick,” he said. “This, which is here, is my foot,” he said.(257)   éa             ne-?imi     poéro   aba eni-pa           mi-a   rey    tau

        “With this egg that I have, I would heal the king’s eyes,” he said.",[79]
"   1.11. Head nouns and their modifiers. Some modifiers in Epena Pedee,
such as demonstrative adjectives, possessives, and noun phrases, precede noun
heads, whereas other modifiers, such as numerals, quantifiers, and descriptive
adjectives and relative clauses, follow them. This is in agreement with
Greenberg’s universal number 19 (1966:87): if the descriptive adjective follows
the noun head, there may be a minority of adjectives which precede it.!°
   I first consider nominal modifiers in which the modifier follows the head.
These include numerals, quantifiers, and adjectives, as shown in (40)—(42);
the modifiers are bracketed.(40)   ipemda-ra     [omé] p*ana-pa-ti-dé            4-ci         —_ak""dre éme

       The two brothers lived with their father.",[29]
"   Marked pronouns, in general, indicate that the speaker is giving special
emphasis to the referents of those pronouns. The suffix éi which marks the
pronouns is similar in use to the referential adjective (§4.6), in that it
relates back to a participant previously mentioned.

   Often, when someone is speaking about what he himself or another
person wants, the marked first- or second-person pronouns are used in
order to emphasize whose will is dominant. In the story from which (233)
is taken, the speaker turns into a monkey when he goes out to the field
to work. He uses the marked pronoun to emphasize that he wants to go
alone. In (234), he uses the marked second-person pronoun pici to em-
phasize the will of the other person.(233) mi-ti ituaba-ta          p""ee-pu-pa-ri                   a-pa-¢i

"   3.9. Generic morpheme ne-. A limited number of open class words
(nouns, adjectives, and verbs) must always be preceded by a modifier, such
as those in the left column in (153). When words such as these are used
in a generic sense, they are preceded by the morpheme ne-, as shown by
those in the right column. (See also §4.7 on inalienably possessed nouns.)
Verbs that contain the generic morpheme have a decreased valence, e.g.,
a transitive verb becomes intransitive. (See §6.3.)(153) et'érre  imi                       ne-Pimi

         (she) cooked plantains          (she) cooked (something)  The generic morpheme always precedes a stem and is phonologically
bound to it. It can occur with only a restricted set of words. Thus, words
such as those in the left column in (154) are acceptable constructions;
those in the right column, however, are not valid (they are generic without
ne-).

                               Noun         Phrase  The noun phrase is composed of a noun head, which may be singular or
plural and simple or complex. The noun may be preceded by a prenominal
modifier (possessive adjective, demonstrative adjective, indexing adjective,
referential adjective, or another noun). The head can be followed by a
postnominal modifier (descriptive adjective, numeral, or quantifier). It is
not usually preceded or followed by more than one element. For more
complex constructions, relative clauses are used (see §§9.9-9.12). Clitics
such as case markers and pluralizers follow the noun phrase.","[57, 58, 59]"

"   As stated early in §§6.11-6.13, the tense suffixes of (400) are mutually
exclusive except for the future suffix, which occurs with present tense -ri
(and, in some cases, with the past tense, as will be shown below). In the
habitual construction of (424), the present tense suffix -ri is followed by
-it'ée to create a future tense habitual. In (425), -dari (completive) is
followed again by -it'ée.(424) ba-pa-ri-it’ée           truwa

"   4.6. Referential adjective. The referential adjective ¢i precedes the
heads of noun phrases and relates them to major participants (see §10.5).
It has no distinct pronominal form, although it is used in relative clauses
that lack nominal heads.!? The referent of ¢/ is often mentioned prior to
its use. In (174), imama ‘tiger’ is mentioned in the first sentence and ¢/ is
used in the second sentence to relate imik'ira ‘male, man’ to it.(174) mia       imama pee-hi      ¢i   imik""ira pa-hi
       T-ERG tiger      _kill-PST REF man       AUX-PST
       I killed the tiger. It was a male (tiger).
    19m other languages of the Chocé family, linguists have called ci a demonstrative
clitic particle (Embera Sambu; Loewen 1958:101) and a definite article (Emberé;
Rasmussen   and Mesiia 1985:124; Wounaan; Sanchez, Castro, and Binder 1977:23).
48                                                             Epena Pedee Syntax   Most commonly ¢i is used to express what appears to be a possessive
relationship between a referent and a related item or person. However,
the possessive quality of the construction is derived from the type of noun
modified by ¢éi. For example, a hand must be a part of someone or
something, while father contains the component of being a father of
someone. In (175), from a text describing a bird, ¢/ precedes the body
parts.(175) ¢i   ek*4rra p'aimda ba-pa-ri            ci      tia     p'orée

"  When a marked pronoun is used as a possessive adjective, possession is
emphasized; miéi is illustrated in (235). In (236), the marked possessive
adjective 4¢i emphasizes that it is their own language.(235) mi-ci     te           awdra 60 — ata-it'ée-da_—_a-hi

"
     §.13. Dissimilarity, The marker -ra indicates dissimilar comparisons, in-
tensified plurals, switches of focus, and conditionals. In each of its usages,
it relates two poles. With the exception of the conditional, each of the
relationships between the two poles involves comparison of one pole with
the other. See §9.5 for a discussion of the conditional.
   A dissimilar comparison involves comparing an entity (one pole) with a
standard of comparison (the second pole). The standard of comparison
may be stated overtly or implied from the context. The dissimilar case
marker -ra is attached to the comparative adjective.
   In the simple comparative clause of (340), the comparative word
k'4y4ara ‘than’ (§1.16) relates the point of dissimilarity between the entity
ardit'a ‘red squirrel’ and the standard sidima ‘brown squirrel’ with which
it is being compared. -ra is attached to the adjective of the comparison.(340) ardit'a            [sidima             k'ayéara tawarda-ra] ba-pa-ri

"   5.5. Possession and composition. A number of morphemes with the
basic form -de all share the general meaning ‘within the limits of. These
morphemes usually modify noun phrases, with the exception of -de ‘in the
process of which modifies verbs (see §9.1). Possessive -de and composition
-dée are discussed in this section. For a discussion of locative -de, see §5.7.
   The possessive marker -dé is attached to noun phrases, except for the
pronouns mi ‘me’ and pi ‘you’ (see §4.14 for possessive pronouns cor-
responding to these morphemes). The interrogative pro-form k’ai bears
the possessive -dé in (281).(281)     khai-dé  ha   isa
          who-Poss that dog
          Whose dog is that?

"   5.4. External goal. -it’ée marks noun phrases as benefactive and noun
phrases or adjectives as an external goal. It also marks dependent verb
phrases which indicate the ultimate purpose and indicates future tense in
independent verb phrases. Thus, -it’ée has a generalized meaning of exter-
nal goal. When modifying a noun phrase or pronoun, the clitic -?it'ée and
the word it attaches to are separated by a glottal stop.
   As the benefactive marker, -?it’ée indicates the noun phrase referring to
the participant for whom the action was performed. The verb tee ‘give’ is
used in the verb phrase when actual physical transfer of an object is
indicated, as in (275).(275) jose-Pit'ée mi-a     hapa   6o _ tee-hi

"     Adjectives    usually end     with    a series of vowels         the first of which       is
stressed, e.g., phaimaa        ‘black’. However, they can also be used as nouns in
headless phrases, as in (141), in which ¢/ refers to the head of the noun
phrase. When this occurs, the adjectives have stress typical of a noun, i.e.,
on the penultimate syllable, and the vowel degeminates as well. In (141),
the adjective phaimda ‘black’ takes nominal stress. Some adjectives can
function as nouns when preceded by the generic morpheme ne- as in (142).(141) ci      p*4ima piPia-ra               bi mi-?it'ée
          REF black   pretty-CMPR be me-for

"  When a common noun modifies another noun, any combination of
nouns that is useful and makes sense in the language is acceptable. The
modifying noun precedes the head noun. In (186), te modifies k""iru.(186) te         k*iru
        house    leaf
        roofing leaves or roof of a house  In (187), the head noun indicates the main idea of the noun phrase ‘a
mother’, while the modifying noun indicates ‘the kind of X’.(187)   sina néwe
        pig mother
        a mother pig  Some nouns take on a somewhat different basic meaning when preceded
by a noun modifier. For example, the noun fe has the basic meaning
‘house’ or ‘man-made dwelling’. However, when preceded by some noun
modifiers, te has the meaning of ‘hollowed out thing’. The modifying noun
generally characterizes what the cavity is in. In (188), the cavity is in rock
and in (189), the cavity is in a tree. In (190), however, the modifier
indicates what possesses, makes, lives in, or uses the cavity or house (viz.,
a bird).(188)      mau te

"   With direct objects, the morpheme -t’aa refers to singular objects and
-k*oo to plural objects (see §6.7). (Both object suffixes are optional.) When
the number of the object is indicated, this may further clarify the refer-
ences to participants in the clause.
   In (764), part of a procedural discourse on canoe making, the noun bi
‘belly, side or stomach’ is not marked as plural but the presence of the
plural object marker -k’00 in the verb phrase establishes the plurality of
the object, whereas the canoe is referred to only by use of the singular
object marker -t'aa; note also that the subject is marked only by a plural

and (83) illustrate intensified adjectives.(82)      (a) pia           ‘good’            (b) pitia       ‘very good or pretty’(83)      (a) p’aimda       ‘black’           (b) p'ai?maéa   ‘very black’     Example (84) compares the regular and de-intensified forms for ‘bad’.(84)      (a) khacia         ‘bad’            (b) k*acik'aéia ‘more or less bad’     Derived adjectives may be formed from other parts of speech. These are
discussed in §§3.1-3.2.     124 very few adjectives have penultimate stress, e.g., ma?ari ‘small’ and céma ‘large’,
both of which have noun-like stress.

modifiers of constituents other than nouns. This section considers three
classes of adverb words in Epena Pedee: time; manner (including a set
derived from demonstrative pronouns); and location and direction. In
addition, there are other adverbs such as i¢iaba ‘also’.","[40, 41]"
"  4.12. Plurality. Plurality is always indicated in noun phrases which refer
to more than one human being. Noun phrases which do not refer to
human beings, whether the referent is animate or inanimate, are not
marked for plurality and may be either plural or singular. Plurality of the
subject is indicated by verb suffixes (see also §10.3). There are also
optional suffixes in the verb phrase that reflect the number of the object
(see §6.7). In addition, there is an intensified plural clitic to indicate a large
amount. These characteristics of plurality in the noun phrase are further
discussed and illustrated in the remainder of this section.
   In (217), the subject is singular, as reflected in the pronoun and the
absence of the plural number indicator on the verb. The object pura
‘shrimp’ is a mass noun that takes the form characteristic of singulars.(217) mi-a      pura     pee-hi     tap'éda

two (geminate) vowels, but not two syllables, because they are stressed
when they occur word final the same as any other VV series.(18)    ta4ama     ‘snake’                       biiri     ‘foot’

ultimate syllable is CVV,            stress occurs on the first V as shown in (19).(19)    tap’éda        ‘morning’                 Cok""4ra       ‘many’
        mik""ia         ‘rancid’                  waibia        ‘big’    Certain meaning differences are encoded only by contrastive stress.?(20)    ée-hi          ‘come (PST)’              cé-hi     ‘come (IMP)’
        mi-a           ‘T (ERGY                  mi-a      ‘| (DAT)’   1.6. Nasalization. Nasalization is a suprasegmental feature that is as-
sociated with the syllable and spreads to the right’ within a word. A
syllable is (a) inherently nasal, containing a nasal segment or segments,
e.g., k'¥ ‘point’, (b) oral, containing no nasal segment, e.g., [¢ehida] ¢e-hi-da
‘come-PST-PL’, or (c) derived nasal which is an oral syllable following a
nasal syllable which becomes nasalized by virtue of spreading, (segments in
bold have derived nasality which originates with the inherent nasal syllable
wa (go))e.g., [Waid] w4-ré ‘go-PRES’ and usually begins with the continuant
r, h, s, w, or y.
   Any segment within a nasal syllable (whether derived or inherently nasal)
occurs in the form of its nasalized variant, e.g., [wahi""da] wa-hi-da ‘go-PsT-
PL’.
  Any plosive preceded by a nasal syllable (whether derived or inherently
nasal) is manifested by its prenasalized variant, e.g., [Wai""t'ée] wd-it'ée
‘g0-FUT’.>
   3In these examples, stress would be written orthographically                 in the less frequent
constructions, i.e., imperatives, datives, adverbs of location, etc.
  ‘Some spreading to the left is possible, as in [tihd] cfhé ‘pineapple’, in which the
morpheme 6 indicates ‘fruit’.
    5Prenasalization     across   morpheme   boundaries     is unpredictable     when   a morpheme
following a nasal syllable begins with a voiceless plosive.

   1.7. Contractions. Several words that have short forms are used in both
oral and written style. These contractions usually involve the omission of a
segment (usually g) or a syllable, as illustrated in (21).(21)   magi           mai               ‘that’
       maga           maa               ‘like that’

                               1,8-1.19 Typological resumé  This is a brief summary of the typological characteristics of Epena Pedee
in relation to the language universals presented by Greenberg (1966) and
Comrie (1981).
  Epena Pedee is a fairly typical subject-object-verb (hereafter SOV) lan-
guage. It is a member of Greenberg’s class 24 (1966:109), i.e., it has SOV
constituent order, postpositions, genitives (possessives) that precede the
noun head, and adjectives that follow the noun head. It is an agglutinative
language: words consist of morphemes that are readily segmentable, i.e.,
each morpheme is phonologically distinguishable from adjacent mor-
phemes.   The verb has categories of number, tense, and mood.","[23, 24, 25]"
"
                               9,9-9.12     Relative     clauses
   Epena Pedee has internally headed relative clauses which, according to
Keenan (1985:163), are found only in SOV languages. The noun phrase which
acts as the head of the relative clause is followed by a restrictive clause which
in turn has the suffix that normally marks the noun phrase in the main clause.
   The table in (674) lists the morphemes that mark the tense and subject
number on the verb of a relative clause. Present tense is indicated with a
relative clause form of the verb bj ‘be’ and past tense is indicated by using
the verb suffix -da. These morphemes                  are discussed further in §9.11.",[182]
"   In other noun phrase constructions, nominalized adjectives function as
noun heads and ¢i again relates to an understood noun. In (177), the noun
p'4ima ‘black one’ is derived from the adjective p’aimda ‘black’ and éi
relates to previously mentioned beads.(177) éi   p*4ima piPia-ra           bi mi-Pit'ée
      REF black   pretty-CMPR be me-for
      To me the black ones (beads) are prettier.",[64]
"  10.4. Marked    pronouns     in discourse.    The   discussion   in this section     is
limited to the uses of the third-person pronouns in narratives. For con-
sideration of the general uses of the unmarked and marked pronouns, see
§4.13.
   There may be more than one major participant in a discourse. When the
storyteller wishes to give prominence to a particular one, that participant
is referred to with a marked pronoun, é¢i ‘he/she/it’, or 4ci ‘they’ (if plural).
However only one major participant (or one group of major participants,
if plural) may be prominent (i.e., marked) at any one time.
   The sentence in (765) is from a story which has an old woman and two
lost children as major participants. The marked pronoun 4éi ‘they’ is used
to give prominence to the children.(765) a-Ci-a         k'4wa p'ana-hi-da         a-¢i     okoktira pre
