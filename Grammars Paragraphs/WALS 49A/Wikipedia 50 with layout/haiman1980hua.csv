17.2     The semantics of conditional clauses       As the preceding section makes clear, what distinguishes
conditional clauses from medials, at least in part, is that they
express events from which nothing necessarily follows. Once this
has been established on the basis of sentences like (127 - 129) ,
there can be no further semantic or phonological obstacle to the
identification of conditionals (clauses with verbs in -mamo3 or
-hipana3)   and inconsequential clauses (whose verbs occur with the
412                              SYNTAXdesinence   -mana3).
     If conditional clauses are the class of clauses whose verb
ends with the characteristic desinence Relative + mo/na,  then it is
not true of such clauses that they are necessarily hypothetical:
witness given conditions. Nor is it the case that they are causal:
witness the contrast between conditionals and coordinate medials.
Since these two characteristics are precisely what usually define
ordinary language conditionals, both in linguistics and philosophy,
(cf. Jespersen 1940, for the hypothetical character of conditionals,
and Strawson 1952 for the idea of causal relationship), the ques­
tion arises whether these clauses are characterized by any semantic
homogeneity whatsoever. The answer of course is yes.
      The properties shared by all conditional clauses are shared as well
by the relative clauses and nominalized clauses in -ma '3 to which they
are morphologically similar. (Recall that -mamo3 is equivalent to
-ma '3 + the potential topic suffix -mo, while -hipana3 is equivalent to
-hipa3 - the relativized form of the irrealis -hine3 - + the nominal
suffix na) .
      These properties, broadly speaking, are the following: unlike co­
ordinate medial clauses, which depend on the following clause in a num­
ber of ways, conditional clauses are independent of following clauses in
tense, mood, and sequence, and impervious to denial from such following
clauses. Their role in sentences is that of most subordinate clauses,
or, for that matter, of referential noun phrases: they mark entities, in
this case, propositions, whose validity is presupposed rather than
asserted.in the framework of discourse.
       They differ from the other subordinate clauses enumerated in
section 13, and from relative clauses, in that they occur in the
nominative case. The nominative case, alone in Hua, has a twofold
function, relating to the systems of transitivity and theme, in the
system of transitivity, it marks the role played by       participants
in an event (e.g., subject of intransitive verb or object of tran­
sitive verb). In the system of thematic relations it marks the
background   for an event, and its function here corresponds rather
to that of the ablative absolute in Latin.
     Conditionals, as clauses in the nominative case, mark back­
ground and serve as the topics of the sentences in which they oc­
cur: not ""what the speaker is talking about"" but rather, ""the old
information"" in the sentence. That this background is relevant to
the events described in the sentence is beyond question (otherwise,
presumably, it would not be included), but its exact relationship
with these events is left unspecified.
      The essential independence of conditional clauses is illus­
trated in the following brief survey of their most characteristic
uses.

clearly non-future, while the hypothetical (hisimamo 'if he does
it') and the counterfactual {hihipana  'if he had done it') are
presumably future.
     The future conditionals may cooccur only with future tense S 2
clauses, but the given conditional may occur with either future or
non-future S 2 clauses, always retaining its own non-future meaning:      130   a)    Zuamo irapamo   hefie

  PART II:MORPHOLOGY
                        THE PARTS OF SPEECH                          1156.   The parts of speech: some morphological definitions     There are three possible syntactic functions for a Hua word:
topic, modifier of topic, or utterance (=predicate). These func­
tions correspond roughly to the three categories Noun, Adjective,
and Verb, which exist in Hua as in other languages. Nevertheless,
the correspondence is not exact: nouns may function not only as
(potential) topics, but also as modifiers and as utterances; verbs
may function not only as utterances, but as modifiers and as top­
ics. Adjectives alone are defined as that class of words which
are possible only as modifiers. (This definition leads to a very
small class of true adjectives, whose membership is similar to
that of adjective classes in other languages with a small, closed
set of adjectives, cf. Dixon 1977.)
     The overlap between nouns and verbs is not entirely a conse­
quence of derivational morphology. It is true that there are a large
number of nominalizing suffixes which may appear on verbs (and a
somewhat smaller number of verbalizing suffixes on nouns), but
there are cases when we find bare nominal roots acting as predi­
cates and bare verbal roots acting as topics. Consequently, the
most reliable criteria for identifying words as nouns, verbs, or
adjectives are generally phonological, morphological, or semantic:
that is to say, anything but syntactic. The following definitions
are phonological and morphological. (Semantically, a noun is the
name of a person, place or thing, while a verb or adjective is the
the name of a state or activity, etc.)
     A verb complex consists of a verb, which may occur with a
number of affixes. Verbs are phonologically distinct from other
words in being subject to the ablaut rules (52), (53), and (58),
and to the syllable structure constraint SSC. 2. They are mor­
phologically distinct from other words in that they occur with a
variety of affixes which specify tense, aspect, and mood. A verb
complex as a whole is distinct from a noun complex in being able
to occur with the prefixes 'a' (a) 'negative' and u' 'already'.
     A noun complex consists of a noun which may occur with a num­
ber of affixes and adjuncts. No special phonological constraints
characterize nouns. Only a noun complex or a derived nominal may
be inflected for case.
     Adjectives by definition are words which may occur only as
modifers on nouns. Most adjectives are prenominal, and are di­
vided into three groups, deictics, quantifiers , and   qualifiers.
 A small number of qualifiers occur post-nominally.
     Interjections are uninflected words which function only as
complete utterances.
116                         MORPHOLOGY
     The following sections, in addition to describing the morpho-
phology of stems and affixes and adjuncts will treat their inter­
nal syntax: the order of morphemes in nominal and verbal complexes,
and constraints on their cooccurrence.
                                    VERB COMPLEXES                                  1177.     Verb complexes     A verb complex is a minimum complete utterance. Subjects
(if the verb is personal) are marked on the verb through ablaut
alternations and personal desinences; objects and indirect objects
are marked by means of personal pronoun prefixes. Thus, complete
sentences with subjects, objects, and indirect objects, are express­
ible by means of single syntactic words. This section will deal
with the internal structure of such words, or verb complexes,
which consist of prefixes, a main verb, auxiliary verbs, and de-
sinential suffixes. 7.1 deals with the internal structure of the
main verb, 7.2 with the nature of the auxiliary system, and the
desinences, 7.3 with prefixes.","[171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176]"
"      Nouns in the genitive case can act only as qualifiers. Nouns
in other cases (the nominative, locative/allative, inessive/illa-
tive, and comitative) may act as qualifiers in some cases. When
they act as nouns, they may occur with the suffix -mo-, when they
act as qualifiers, they may not.
     The nominative (or absolutive) case is used for the first
members of N+N nominal compounds, where the first member qualifies
or limits the second: zu' 'house', fu±zu' 'pig house'. While the
                               NOUN COMPLEXES                            247first member of such a compound may sometimes occur with the ci­
tation suffix -a (a notable example being ()Kia'+    a Koa /kianagoa/
'foot penis' or 'toenail'), it may never occur with the suffix
-mo: fu (*mo)±zu'   'pig house'; ube 'ancestor', Ke 'story', ube (*mo)
±Ke 'myth'; Kenaga 'long time ago', vede 'men', Kenaga       (*mo)±vede
 'men of long ago'.
     The long form of the adessive/allative case is used as a
qualifier: thus, for example, the phrase d#mu'+roga 'on my sore',
may function either as an adverb phrase, as in /osi' dmutoga baie/
'the flies are on my sores' or as a kind of relative clause
/dmutoga osi'/ 'the flies (which are) on my sores'. In the first
case, the suffix -mo is possible, while in the second, it is not.
The sentence  d # mu ' + roga               osi'     bai  -f- ve      ?
  my  sore    (ad./all.)        flies    be 2     int.Amay have two possible readings, depending on how it is bracketed:  [d # mu'+roga   osi']       baive     'Are you the flies on my sores?'
  [d # mu'+roga] [osi1]       baive     'Are (there) flies on my sores?'","[305, 306]"

                              TRANSITIVITY                      363In English, the ""because      "" clause is identifiable, trivially,
as the cause clause. It is also clearly not the subject of the
sentence in which it occurs. In Hua, the cause clause, occurring
with the ergative case inflection, shares the morphology of the
subject of a transitive verb:    45   Mni'   doma'na+mu'           dnu'    tgieNo such transitive verb, of course, appears in the surface struc­
ture of this sentence. On could posit an abstract verb ""cause""
and assign (42) the structure
     NP (S)                    NP (0)                  V
                1
     Mni doma       namu'      dnu'    tgie          (cause)On nominalized sentences as on ordinary noun phrases, the er­
gative case inflection is optional: further evidence beyond mor­
phological identity that the suffix we are dealing with in the two
contexts is the same one.
      In summary, the functions of the -mu' inflection in Hua are
varied, but the best single approximation to a definition of this
ending is that it is an ergative case ending. Among the more or
less undesirable consequences of this position, however, are the
fact that the inflection can appear on the subjects of unambig­
uously intransitive  verbs of the form NP±hu- (if the meanings of
these verbs are to be unchanged), and the fact that its appearance
on nominalized clauses forces us to posit an unrealized causative
verb.
     Is Hua, then, an ergative language? Yes, but to a very mild
extent.
     Morphologically, subjects of intransitive verbs and objects
of transitive verbs are grouped together in their inability to
occur with a -mu' inflection, and opposed to the subjects of
transitive verbs, which can occur with such a suffix.
     Syntactically, however, it is fairly clear that subjects,
whether of transitive or intransitive verbs, are grouped together
and opposed to objects. Subjects of verbs cause one kind of verb
agreement, expressed in a set of root alternations and suffixes on
the verb; objects, whether direct or indirect, cause another kind
of verb agreement, expressed in a set of prefixes on the verb.
     The only syntactic fact which might support the claim that
Hua was an ergative language is the fact, already noted, that
364                         SYNTAXthere exist a large number of transitive impersonal verbs, which
correspond to intransitive verbs in English. That the experiencer
of verbs of physical and emotional state is treated as the object
of such verbs in Hua, unlike English, suggests that to a modest
extent, and with a restricted set of verbs, Hua is syntactically
grouping together the single arguments of one-place predicates
(i.e. subjects of intransitive verbs) and the object complements
of two place predicates (i.e. objects of transitive verbs).
                            AGREEMENT PHENOMENA                  36516.   Agreement phenomena     The most pervasive syntactic fact in Hua is the rich and
complex agreement system whereby verbs agree with their subjects,
objects, and indirect objects, medial verbs agree with the sub­
jects of following verbs, and nouns agree with their possessors and
referents with respect to both person and number. The mechanics
of these agreement processes are the subject of this section.
     The point of view adopted here is that all marks of person
and number of subject and object on verbs, and of possessor on
nouns, are the result of a transformation: that, while the surface
structure of a sentence may consists of only a single verb, its
deep structure will have as many NP as the verb has semantic argu­
ments; and that the reason a verb may function as a complete sen­
tence is that unstressed pronoun arguments are automatically
deleted once agreement has occurred.
     The syntactic motivation for this position is that agreement
rules are necessary to mark agreement with stressed pronouns and
non-pronominal arguments in any case:      46            a)   Dgaimo d+ge
                         'He saw me.'
                    b)   Vedemo p+ge
                         'He saw the men.'","[421, 422, 423, 424]"
"
11.2   Interrogative nouns     The interrogative kzo'   'who' corresponds to nouns with human
referents. It occurs, like any other noun, with the full range
of case affixes, although there are two idiosyncrasies to be noted:
the genitive case suffix is zero, and an alternative enlarged
form of the pronoun, kzo'ama' T occurs optionally before the geni­
tive and the comitative case affixes:  Nominative: kzo' +0        (+mo)         'who'
  Ergative : kzo' + mamu '   (+mo)
  Genitive : Kzo' +0         (*+mo) ~kzo' ama' +ø      (*mo) 'whose*
  Comitative: kzo! + Ki'     (+mo) ~ kzo ' ama ' + Ki' (+mo) 'with whom'
  Locative : kzo ' + ro'     (+mo)         ' to whom '
  Inessive : kzo ' + vi '    (+mo)         ' in whom '
  Ablative : kzo ' + roti'   (+mo)         ' from whom '
  Elative   : kzo' + viti'   (+mo)         'out of whom'     There is no vocative. However, unlike all other pronouns
and common nouns, kzo' may be followed by the second person sin­
gular pronoun apposition (before which, like all words, it loses
its final glottal stop), and this form /kzoga/ functions some­
thing like a vocative.          kzoga + e                 : 'Who are you?'
          kzoga 4- mo + sentence    : 'Who are you that S?'",[335]
"     It serves as well as the syllable enlargements -mo and -a to
prevent monosyllabic noun stems from remaining monosyllabic noun
phrases:      Aiga
                      H
                 de - i mor        Ke
                                               M
                                          - i moï     mi      -su            -ne
                       M                   l*naj

      'Which man shall we give the word to (=vote for)?'
     However, it is clearly different from these two, not only
that its distribution is limited to nouns which occur with a
deictic prenominal qualifier (hence the impossibility of -na on Ke
above), but in occupying a different slot. - While -mo and -a are
mutually exclusive, the deictic suffix -na cooccur with both of
them:
                              ma         de      - < r      - na
                                                   {mo}
                              this       man                  here8.3     Prefixes on the noun complex     Of the four classes of prefixes occurring on verbs, only one,
the negative 'a'a, does not also occur on nouns. The same meaning­
less prefix ha- occurs on nouns, and allows the same infixation
of personal pronoun prefixes as outlined above in section 7.3.
      The personal pronoun prefixes themselves, which indicate the
object of transitive verbs, mark the possessor of inalienably pos­
sessed nouns: d#za'  'my hand, arm', dttsa' 'my sister (male ego)';
d jfhamu' (by infixation /handamu'/ 'my namesake', and so on.
                           NOUN COMPLEXES                             255
     All kin terms are inalienably possessed; so,, too, are a small
number of terms of non-kin relationship, such as ()hamu'   'name­
sake', Ovaru'   'agemate', ()Koe' 'enemy', ()au'vi  ' friend (male) ' .
     All body parts are inalienably possessed, as are the names
of diseases affecting them: ()haiti    'tinea', ()hainuna   'wart',
and of bodily emissions: ()vari    'sweat', ()auni   'tears' ()nu
'vital essence, sperm'.
     In most cases, the failure of nouns belonging in these classes
to occur with pronoun prefixes can be explained by phonetic con­
straints. Thus, the syllable structure constraints of section 4
explain the impossibility of *()bade '(one's) son' and    *()bopo'
'(one's) father's sister', while the marked syllable rule of
section 7 explains the non-occurrence of *()ete  '(one's) husband'
and *()iko' '(one's) navel'.
     There are, however, a number of supposedly inalienably pos­
sessed nouns, with no discernible phonetic or semantic homogenei­
ty, which cannot occur with personal pronouns prefixes. Among
them are the kin terms rata' 'grandparent, ancestor', nono' 'ma­
ternal uncle', the body part Kora' 'blood', and the bodily emis­
sions ai 'faeces' and vi 'urine'.

determiners to be discussed in this section are also underlying
nouns, capable of, but not limited to, acting as adjectives.","[313, 314, 315, 316]"
"3.1.3.1 The general ablaut rule with subjectless verbs     In Hua, as in most other languages (Perlmutter's ""type B
languages"", Perlmutter 1971), unstressed pronouns are deleted by
a low-level rule. The fact that verbs agree with these pronouns
is not particularly unusual. As is the case with languages like
56                                  PHONOLOGYItalian and Turkish, the rule of agreement is simply ordered to
apply before pronoun deletion.
     But there are other rules which delete subjects at a much
deeper level, rules like equi-noun phrase deletion and imperative
subject deletion which apply not only in type B languages, but in
type A languages like English as well. Of the resulting verb forms,
imperatives generally agree with their subjects, but infinitives
never, or seldom do.
     The situation is different in Hua: before the imperative and
infinitive suffixes, verbs are subject to the general ablaut rule,
and thus agree with subjects which may have been deleted by imper­
ative formation and equi-noun phrase deletion.
     Below are the imperatives of hu 'do', do 'eat1 and ml f give ! ,
in the singular, dual and plural forms:                  singular:       hu         do        ml
                  dual    :       hi +'o     de +'o    ml +'o
                  plural :        hi + o     de +ho    ml + oThe forms of the imperative suffix require further discussion,
but stems are as the general ablaut rule would predict.
     The infinitive is formed by the addition of the suffix -dl'
to the verb stem, and occurs in a variety of contexts. The oper­
ation of the general ablaut rule may be seen if we consider one
of these, where the verb occurs as the complement of korlhu 'be
afraid', as in ""I am afraid to go"". Objects of korlhu  occur in
the benefactive case, so the infinitive will be followed by the
benefactive case suffix hi'.  In languages like English, the in­
finitive is invariable, irrespective of the person and number of
the underlying subject. In Hua, the infinitive has to appear in
one of two forms in obedience to the general ablaut rule.
                              korlhue      'I am afraid to go.'

agree with the free-standing pronoun dgai (lsg.) and the common
noun vedemo (3pl.) respectively, there is no way to obviate the
need for an agreement rule. Given the existence of such a rule,
and the nearly universal tendency in languages with developed
agreement systems to delete pronouns, it is natural to derive the

16.1     The expression of possession     There are three ways of indicating the possessor of a possess­
ed noun: the genitive case of the possessor noun (e.g. dgai'  fu
'my pig'), the possessive prefix (e.g. dnogu''rny maternal nephew'),
and the possessive suffix (e.g. fudi 'my pig'). The purpose of
this section is to discuss the relationship between these three
ways of marking possession.
     Of these three means of marking possession, the possessive
prefix is limited to inalienably possessed nouns (note the impos­
sibility of saying, for example *dfu 'my pig'), and subject to
phonological constraints, is obligatory for these nouns. (Note
that it is impossible to say *dgai' nogu' or *nogudima' for 'my
maternal nephew', so long as prefixation is available).
     The other two devices are available for both alienable and
inalienably possessed nouns.
     Only the genitive case of the full possessor noun is in the
deep structure representation of the possessor: both prefixes and
suffixes of possession are the result of agreement transforma­
tions, which may be distinguished as prefix agreement and suffix
agreement.
       On inalienably possessed nouns, prefix agreement must apply
wherever possible. Where prefix agreement is blocked for any
reason, suffix agreement must apply. However, where prefix agree­
ment yields a zero output (i.e. in the 3sg., where the prefix is
0 ) , suffix agreement need not apply. It is possible for both pre­
fix and suffix agreement to mark an inalienably possessed noun:        Prefix agreement only: d+nogu'         'my maternal nephew'
                               k+naru'         'your wife'
                               r+gia'          'our feet'
        Suffix agreement only: ete+di          'my husband'
                               vza+'a          'his/her mouth'
                               iko+ka          'your navel'
                           AGREEMENT PHENOMENA                              367
    Both prefix and suffix: d+nogu+dima'             'my maternal nephew'
                            k+naru+kama'             'your wife'
                            r+gia+ti                 'our feet'Infixation whether in irregular nouns like e'gu' 'elder brother'
or in regular /ha../ initial nouns like hamu' 'namesake' is syn­
tactically equivalent to prefixation, as the necessary mark of
possession for inalienably possessed nouns: thus, the impossibil­
ity of *dgai'e'gu' 'my elder brother' or *hamu+kama' 'your name­
sake ' .
     Inalienably possessed nouns which are marked by neither pre-
fixation or suffixation for the person of the possessor are un-
grammatical: thus, *dgai'ete 'my husband', *Kgai vza 'your mouth'.
     On alienably possessed nouns, prefix agreement is impossible,
and suffix agreement optional. Possession must be marked in some
way, but this may be by either the genitive noun phrase, the pos­
sessive suffix, or both: dgai' fu, fudi, or dgai' fudi 'my pig'.
     Cooccurrence of both prefix and suffix of possession on those
inalienably possessed nouns which allow it seems to be no differ-
rent from the appearance of just the prefix. However, cooccurrence
of either prefix or suffix with the free-standing genitive pro­
noun, or the occurrence of just the free-standing pronoun with
alienably possessed nouns marks emphatic or contrastive stress of
the possessor:     Possessor not stressed: d+nogu'        ~ d+nogu+dima'      'my maternal
                                                                 nephew'

     Possessor stressed:       dgai1    dnogu'                  'my maternal
                                                                 nephew'
                               dgai'   ete+di                   'my husband'
                               dgai'fu    (+di)                 'my pig'This suggests the existence of a transformation which deletes the
unstressed possessor pronoun on condition that a prior agreement
rule has allowed the recoverability of this deletion.","[424, 425, 426]"

8.2.5.7    The utterance case: the vocative     The vocative has been traditionally named a case on paradig­
matic grounds, although it differs syntactically from all other
cases: while true cases define the role a noun plays as part of a
sentence, the vocative form of a noun is in itself a complete
sentence. In Hua, the vocative case is not only syntactically,
but also morphologically distinct from other cases: although mu­
tually exclusive with them, it occurs in a different ""slot"", and
cannot be fully described until the appearance and distribution
of two further post-nominal suffixes, the citation suffix -a and
the potential topic marker -mo has been completed.",[299]
"   5.   If you want liquor or beer, you'll have to pay extra,
        (non-exhaustive)
   6.   Whether you want liquor or beer, you'll have to pay extra.
        (exhaustive)     In (5), other possibilities besides those enumerated are
envisioned: nor is it excluded that the addressee may wish to have
both beer and liquor.
     In (6), it is assumed that no other drinks are available or
of any interest to the addressee: and it is assumed that he will
choose between the mutually exclusive alternatives of beer and
liquor.
     The basic meaning of -ve is then identified as that of dis­
junction: the reading ""and/or"", that of inclusive disjunction, is
a consequence of the fact that -ve, unlike -Ki, marks non-
exhaustive enumeration.
     Some, but not all, of the syntactic differences between these
two coordinators, seem to follow naturally and immediately from
this difference in meaning.
     The most evident is that -ve is used to conjoin any number
of nouns, while ki is generally used only for two, occasionally
three:          I.   Two or three nouns conjoined
               »4 «4 - 4
         II.   More than three nouns conjoined                                         KP       sp
               - (4 - {4 - {4 Í4 Í4
Since lists in which a large number of items are enumerated tend
to be open-ended, this pattern follows directly from the fact
that -Ki marks exhaustive listing. Other differences are less
obvious.
252                                 MORPHOLOGY     It is impossible, using either -Ve or -Ki, to conjoin nouns
in the ergative, genitive, or vocative cases (irrespective of the
phonetic shape of these case markers on the nouns conjoined):
   Ergative: *de + mu'      ■/■ mo -f | ,| a' + mamu'      + mo + *\ . r
                  'the man (erg.) and the woman (erg.)'   Genitive: *de + ma'      + (mo) V^>      a ' + ma ' + (mo) \ ^ \        (fu)
                  'the man's and the woman's (pig)'   Vocative : *ma de + a + \ „ ,\ ma a' + a + \ „ . \
                            [Kl)                {Kl}
               'You man and you woman!'
A partial explanation for this failure is the following: the po­
tential topic suffix -mo may not cooccur with either genitives or
vocatives; the citation suffix -a, which can occur only in voca­
tives, must cooccur with the predicate marker -e, which, however,
is mutually exclusive with both -ve and -Ki.  However, both the
conjunctions -ve and -Ki require that the immediately preceding
morpheme be one of either -mo and -a. The conflict between these
various constraints makes the conjunction of genitives and voca­
tives impossible.
     The failure of the ergative suffix to occur with either of
the conjunctions -ve or -Ki correlates with the constraint that
the ergative suffix is possible only on nouns that are understood
as the only subjects of transitive verbs: nouns which are parts
of such subjects are hence excluded.
     Some evidence for the generality of this constraint is forth­
coming when we begin to consider ways in which -ve and -Ki    differ,
in the vocative, genitive, and ergative.
     While nouns in these cases may not be conjoined, the con­
junction of two nouns may itself be treated as a noun phrase on
which the ergative, genitive, and vocative suffixes are added.
But the only possible conjunction is -Ki,      Ergative:   \de + mo + j ^ 1 \       a1       + mo + \¿   1
                                                                 )r\   +    mi

(The genitive suffix after conjunctions, as after proper names
and personal pronouns, is apparently zero.) To be understood as
vocatives, two noun phrases that are conjoined must each be fol­
lowed by the personal pronoun apposition of the second person
singular, -Ka.     The conjunction of these nouns may not itself be
followed by any of the regular vocative suffixes (-a+e, or -o),
but may be followed by the second person dual personal pronoun
apposition -Kita'a    'you two'. This form, it seems, is semantical-
ly equivalent to a vocative suffix, and is only possible, like
the other case suffixes above, when the two nouns are conjoined
by -ICi:
    Kamani' + Ka + mo +   Å.    >   Busa'   + Ka + mo +   i .   r   +
   L_                     |^*vej                           { ve)J
    Kamani    you            and    Busa      you             and
    Kita'a
    you two
    'Kamani and Busa!'
     Clearly, strings of the form A+Ki B+Ki are treated as single
noun phrases, while strings of the form A+ve B+ve are not. They
may be diagrammatically distinguished as (1) and (2) below:
But such a distinction is possibly what should be expected, given
that lists of items conjoined by -Ki are exhaustive, and lists of
items conjoined by -ve are not. The former constitute a well-
defined group, and the latter do not.
      It has already been proposed that the ergative suffix can oc­
cur on noun phrases only when these are understood as the only
subjects of their predicates. This constraint correlates with the
failure of the ergative suffix to occur on the partial lists A+ve
B+ve.   Furthermore, there is evidence, again from English, that
the vocative at least is similarly constrained: it is possible on­
ly when the addressee(s) are exhaustively enumerated. Compare,
for example, the well-known sentences          1.    Hey, everybody, let's really do some dancing.
          2.   *Hey, somebody, let's really do some dancing.
254                                       MORPHOLOGY
8.2.9        The deictic   -na     The suffix -na 'this, here', may follow any suffix or combi­
nation of suffixes on any common noun which occurs with a prenom-
inal deictic qualifier. It may be rendered by (colloquial) Eng­
lish ""here"", as in ""this guy here"", or French ""là"", as in ""ce
bougre-là"". It may be a loan translation of Pidgin English hia
'here', whose distribution is wider than that of the cognate
Colloquial English etymon, in that it cooccurs with interrogative
deictic qualifiers as well as demostratives:                     Pidgin :           wonem       mer i          hia   ?
                     Hua    :           aiga        a'             na    ?
                     English:           *which      woman          here ?","[310, 311, 312, 313]"
"
8.2.5.6        Genitive: the qualifying case     The genitive in Hua creates possessive phrases. In English
such a possessive phrase as ""the man's"" may function as either an
adjective or a noun:                   It is the man's boat, (adjective)
                   It is the man's.      (noun)In Hua, only the adjectival usage is possible. Since there are
no verbs or postpositions in Hua which require genitive govern­
ment, nor any absolutive constructions in the genitive, it follows
that the sole syntactic function of a noun in the genitive case
in Hua is to act as an adjective. Like the ergative, the geni­
tive has both singular and plural forms.
     The unmarked genitive singular suffix -ma'          (postglottal
['ßa']) follows all common noun stems:      de + ma'      (fu)                  'the man's (pig)'
      a' + ma'      ([a'ßa']) (fu)        'the woman's (pig)*     The genitive on proper names, unsuffixed kin terms and per­
sonal pronouns is 0:      dgai'      (na)      'my (thing)'
      Buró'      (fu)      'Büro's (pig)'
      dnogu'     (zu')     'my sister's son's (house)'Personal pronouns occur with a final /'/ in the genitive, but
since this sound occurs before other case affixes such as the lo­
cative and the benefactive as well, /'/ cannot be identified as
an allomorph of the genitive. Note that the final /'/ of geni­
tives does not coalesce with the first consonant of the following
word: dgai' fu does not become */dgaipu/, nor does kzo' ru' 'whose
axe' become */kzotuf/.
     The distinction between long and short possessive suffixes
is neutralized when these are followed directly by the genitive
case marker: the short forms add -ma', the regular form of the
genitive singular, and the long forms (which already end in -ma')

add 0. An alternative formulation would have the genitive singu­
lar ending -ma1 added consistently to both suffix types, with a
rule of obligatory haplology converting the ungrammatical se­
quence *ma'+ma' to /ma'/:   ete   + 'di    + ma'            >/etedima'/       'my husband's'
   nono' + 'dima' + ma'            >/nonodima'/      'my maternal uncle's'Like the ergative plural suffixes, the regular genitive plural
ending -'i' may be added only to nouns which are animate. Nouns
which form their ""plural"" with one of the collective suffixes
vza or vutavu do not need to occur with this suffix in order to
be followed by the genitive plural ending:                   mna + ' i'               'birds''
                   mna + vza + 'i'          'flock of birds's'However, both proper nouns and kin terms, which occur with one of
the true pluralizing suffixes ra or Ki must occur with this suffix
in order to appear in the genitive plural:   Norope' + Ki + 'i'              (*norope' + 'i')            'the Norope family's'
   nono ' + ' dima ' + ra + ' i'    (*nono ' + ' dima ' + ' i ' ) 'my maternal uncles' '     Finally, the handful of common nouns with human referents
which form suppletive plural stems have suppletive genitive plu­
ral forms as well:                             Plural stem         Genitive plural
                people       naga '              naga'i'
                men          vi                  vi'i'
                men          vede                vedi '

                girls        abadevede           abadi'In the case of the first two nouns in the table above, the regu­
lar genitive ending is simply added to the plural stem. In the
third and fourth, the genitive plurals could perhaps be viewed as
irregular reductions of * v e d e ' i and *ade'i' f by a rule which con­
verted /*e'i'/ to /!'/• T h e same rule could apply in the deriva­
tion of the fifth and sixth forms above, where the genitive plu­
ral ending was suffixed directly to the singular stems bade and
abade.","[297, 298]"

4.   Nouns occur with topic suffixes     In Hua, noun phrases occur with the suffixes -mo and -ve of
which the second (the actual topic marker) may occur only if pre­
ceded by the first (the potential topic marker). All nouns imme­
diately but not exhaustively dominated by S may occur with -mo.
     In Gimi, the suffix -ve seems to correspond to both -mo and
-ve of Hua. In Siane, the single suffix -ma corresponds to both.
Gahuku has -mo' (Deibler 1976: 50) and Fore -pa (Scott 1973: 16).
     Among the languages of the Eastern Family, Usarufa has -ma
as a nominal suffix on nouns (Bee 1973: 220). From Bee's descrip­
tion, it contrasts with the ""predicative"" suffix -e, the first
being found on topics, the second on comments, of verbless sen­
tences. Auyana has a suffix -maN which McKaughan calls the ""nom-                                  xliv
                           INTRODUCTIONinative"" case marker. He himself provides evidence, however, that
it cannot be a case affix, but rather has a function similar to,
if not identical with, that of Hua -mo.  In the first place, it
cooccurs with other case affixes such as the inessive: ana + piN
+maN (=bamboo + inessive + maN) ""in the bamboo"". Second, it can
occur only on the head noun of a compound NP (i.e., like Hua -mo
it can follow only NP which are directly dominated by S ) .
     Among the languages of the West-Central family, Kewa has the
topic suffix -re (Franklin 1971: 62).
     No similar morpheme has been reported (as far as I know) for
other ENGH languages, but the feature is one which clearly is at­
tested outside the ENGH, and even outside the TNGP.
     A topic suffix on NP is encountered in Wojokeso, a TNGP lan­
guage of the Angan family (West 1973: 4, 22); and Daga, a TNGP
language of the Dagan family (Murane 1974: 16). It is also cer­
tainly attested in Bilua, a language of the East Papuan Phylum
(E. Wheeler, personal communication).
     A widespread secondary feature with which this morpheme is
associated is the marking of protasis clauses in conditional sen­
tences. Noting this secondary function in Kewa, Franklin (1971:
120) comments that ""any sentence whose topic and comment are ex­
pounded by verbal clauses has the semantic interpretation of a
condition ... the topic has the subfunction of protasis; the com­
ment, the subfunction of apodosis"". Similar observations are im­
plicit in the discussions of BenaBena (Young 1964: 46, 51), Fore
(Scott 1973: 16) and Daga (Murane 1974: 15-6).
     If the categories of topic and protasis were semantically
unrelated, their conflation in various languages of New Guinea
might provide evidence for their genetic relationship. In fact,
however, they are related and morphologically identical in a num­
ber of clearly unrelated languages, among them Chinese (Chao 1968:
81-120, passim).  The nature of their relationship is extensively
discussed in Haiman 1978.","[45, 46]"
"
8.2.5.1   Nominative     The nominative or absolutive case is the case in which nouns
occur that are subjects of intransitive verbs, direct or indirect
objects of (di)transitive verbs, and qualifiers in nominal com­
pounds. It is invariably the unmarked case, its characteristic
mark, the suffix ø. There is however a special suffix -a, called
the citation suffix, which occurs regularly and exclusively on
nominal stems in the nominative case alone: although it is in com­
plementary distribution with the potential topic suffix -mo, and
discussed together with this suffix, its limited distribution may
lead in time to its reinterpretation as the characteristic sign of
the nominative case.",[287]

on inalienably possessed nouns where Tl cannot apply or leaves no
visible mark and is optional elsewhere.
     Tl is the only source for pronoun prefixes on possessed nouns;
T2, however, cannot be the only source for possessive suffixes.
     The lsg. suffix -di (on kin terms and proper names   -dima')
may occur on nouns to indicate satisfaction, pleasure, or affec­
tion. Thus, such forms as                        ega'a + di         'tomorrow, oh boy..'
                        Buro + dima'       '(my) old buddy Buro'as well as one         rather peculiar idiom.
     The clearest proof that the lsg. possessive suffix cannot
always derive from T2 is the fact that in this idiom, it does not
agree with the possessive prefix.
      The idiom is a vocative expression of endearment:                    K - go (a) -     ' a - di               e
                    your penis     (nom.) my              (voc.)

                              AGREEMENT PHENOMENA                                369the appropriate form being used depending on whether one is ad­
dressing a single man, woman, group of men, group of women, etc.
The variable prefix pronoun K- 'your (sg.)' and p- 'your (pl.)'
refers to the addressee(s), the possessor(s) of goa 'penis' or
gau 'vagina'. The invariable possessive suffix di clearly does
not.  It functions here, as on ega'adi and Burodima', as a mark of
affection and enthusiasm.
     It would be possible to argue that the lsg. possessive suffix
on expressions such as these is in fact not a possessive suffix at
all, but an accidental homophone, were it not for the fairly clear
connection which exists even in languages like English between
expressions of possession and (proprietary) pride and affection.
In any case, it does not owe its origin to a copying transforma­
tion like T2.
      Still another source must be posited for the use of the 2sg,
possessive suffix -ka, meaning ""a certain.."": keBiri  vi+ka  fumo
kaie:  'a certain stunted man took care of the pigs'. This man
does not belong to the addressee any more than his English
congener does in expressions like ""your average heroin addict"".
     Finally, it is implausible that possessive suffixes added
to personal pronouns to form emphatic or reflexive pronouns are
added to these pronouns by a copying transformation. It is possi­
ble, but semantically pointless, to derive rgai-hti  'we ourselves;
just us' from underlying *rgai' rgai 'our we' or kai'a    'she her­
self; just her' from an underlying expression *kai'   kai 'her she'.
     This is particularly clear in the case of medial verbs whose
pronominal anticipatory desinence may be followed by a prefer­
ential possessive suffix with the same meaning ""just; only"":    48   a)   Vede   -   mo   bai   - t o        ka     - ka      kai   -   mo

        thing I would do'Relative clauses seem to be déverbal adjectives: certainly, they
function as adjectives in the case above. There is evidence,
however, that they are really déverbal nouns which, like numerals,
locative expressions, and nouns in the absolutive-nominative case,
are able to occur as qualifiers.
     Syntactically bivalent nouns like rori 'two' and du' + roga
'on the breast' are disambiguated by the presence of the potential
topic suffix -mo: without this suffix, they are able to act as
either nouns or verbs; with it, they are able to act only as nouns.
     Relative clauses seem to be disambiguated in the same way:
followed by the potential topic suffix -mo, they cease to be rel­
ative clauses, and become conditionals:                    hima ' + mo   (/hirriamo/)
                    'when he did it; given that he did it.'
                    hi sima' + mo (/hisimamo/)
                     'if he does it'(The final glottal stop disappears before -mo for unmarked condi­
tionals: however, a rarely used conditional form, apparently syn­
onymous with the above, does not have such deletion: /himabo/.
In any case, the absence of the final glottal stop is so frequent,
though irregular, a phenomenon in Hua morphological alternations,
that it does not prevent the identification of relative clauses
and conditionals here.)
     At this point, conditional clauses will be analyzed, on pure­
ly morphological grounds, as nominal expressions:
264                                MORPHOLOGY
     Relative clauses seemingly differ from other bivalent nomi­
nal expressions in that they cannot function as nouns (i.e., as
conditional clauses), without the disambiguating suffix -mo: the
expression hima', by itself, cannot be a conditional clause.
Nevertheless, the distinction between relative clauses and other
bivalent nominal expressions is more apparent than real: all that
is necessary, apparently, is that the relative clause be followed
by some suffix to be a nominal expression, and most of the suffixes
with which it may cooccur are found on nouns.
     An example of such a suffix is the restrictive quantifier
-Ko' 'only', before which the relative clause loses its final
glottal stop, and becomes an unambiguous conditional clause,
whether or not the restrictive quantifier is followed itself by
-mo:         hisima'   + Ko'   (+mo)   (/hisimagobo/)     'only if he comes'     Other examples are the case suffixes, most of which may be
adjoined directly to the relative verb to create subordinate
clauses of various types:       Adessive/Allative:     hima'   + ro'     'when he did it'
       Inessive/Illative:     hima'   + vi'     'while he was doing it'
     Comparative evidence from Gimi, spoken to the West of Hua,
strongly suggests that the purposive desinence -mi'3 is actually
a combination of the relative desinence -ma'3 and the benefactive
case affix -hi': in Gimi, -mi ' 3 is translated by -maj + ke, where
-ma3 is cognate with the relative desinence, and -ke is the bene-
factive case affix.)
                                 PRENOMINAL QUALIFIERS                                 265
     The frequently idiosyncratic meanings of relative clauses
with case affixes are discussed in more detail in section 13, be­
low. The existence of such clauses, in the meantime, leaves no
doubt concerning the fundamental nominal status of the relative
clause construction.
     Relative clauses with the copula verbs bai- (animate), no-
(inan.) and the pseudo-copula verbs ro- 'be' and hu- 'do' may
undergo a process of relative clause reduction whereby the rela­
tivized form of the verb is deleted, leaving the complement of
the verb to stand before the noun it modifies as an apparent ad­
jective. None of these complements, however, is a true adjective:
all of them, like relative clauses, are nouns capable of acting
as qualifiers.
         Relative clause reduction is obligatory with the copula verbs
bai-     and no-:
  ¡bade figapa        bai        + e             bade =>\figapa       [bai+ma]\   bade                                                                           0
   boy      non-     be 3          (fin.A)       boy      'non-initiate           boy'
            initiate  \ru'     zu1   +vina      ne     +e             ru'   =>\zupina [ne+ma']        ru                                                                       0
   axe house        (in.) be 3         (fin.A)    axe     'house-in               axe'     Complements of copula verbs in English may be either nouns,
adjectives or adverbs: in Hua, they may be only nouns. Any noun
capable of acting as the complement of a copula verb is able to
act as the subject of a sentence, to occur with case affixes, and
so forth.
     Relative clause reduction is also obligatory when the copula
verb is ro-.    This verb, whose principle lexical meaning is ""burn"",
functions as the perfective auxiliary. It also occurs as the
copula with a small number of complements, all of them pejorative
and expressive of physical decrepitude or stuntedness: among them
are Kosita   'old' (man), tava 'old1 (inanimate object), Kagia
'bald', KeBiri,   Keva 'stunted' (animal or vegetable), and fuipa'
'stunted' (vegetable). There are more, but the semantic homoge­
neity of the group seems quite evident.","[322, 323, 324]"
"Further details attest to the intimate semantic connection between
hu- and hau-.  For example, a large number of impersonal verbs
occur in two forms: NP + hu and NP + ()hau-.   The only difference
in their meaning is that of expressed transitivity:
                          VERB COMPLEXES                            213
 buko hu 'be hot'   contrasts, with buko ()hau- 'feel hot';
 f tu hu 'smell'        ""       ""   f tu  ()hau- ' smell something '
 haga hu 'be sweet'     ""       ""    haga ()hau- 'taste sweet to one'
 Kta hu 'be heavy'      ""       ""    Kta   ()hau- ' be heavy f or one 1     In at least one transitive verb, two forms are in free vari­
ation: ""catch"" can be represented by either ()tva hu or tva   ()hau.
     Finally, in related languages of the area, the two verbs are
similar or identical. This is less impressive in a language like
Gimi, where the same etymon ho- renders both ""please"" and ""do"",
since cognates of homonyms are likely to be homonyms or identical
in any case. It is more striking in Siane, where the verbs are
ro- 'do' and eDo- 'please', and the suppletive alternant of ""do""
in the negative is aDo— eDo-. Here superficial similarity cannot
be attributed to cognation with a pair of homonyms, but argues
for underlying similarity of meaning.
     There is a major apparent syntactic problem in identifying
hu- and ()hau- in compound verbs of the form Root + verb: ()NP + hu,
in which the pronoun object prefix precedes the NP is opposed to
NP + ()hau, in which it precedes the verb. Perhaps, it could be
argued, this superficial distinction reflects a major difference
between hu- and ()hau-.  Given that the object prefix pronoun pre­
cedes the verb in all cases, the syntactic structure of ()NP + hu
is that of (1), while that of NP + ()hau is that of (2):
Then, in impersonal verbs of the form illustrated at the bottom of
page 212, the root nouns fugo'na 'cold', Kosa 'falling down', and
their like are the subjects of transitive verbs.
     There is syntactic evidence, however, that the analysis (2)
is incorrect. If it were correct, then the nouns fugo'na  'cold',
etc., should be able to appear with the ergative case suffix -mu ' r
reserved for the subject of transitive verbs. In fact, they never
can:                     Fugo'na (**mu')     haie.
                     'He has a cold.'
214                         MORPHOLOGYThese impersonal verbs, are truly subjectless. The NP of NP + ()hau~
is part of the Verb Complex, and the distinction ()NP + hu ^
NP + ()hau- is a superficial one attributable to phonotactic con­
siderations alone. Hu- does not allow prefixation, while ()hau-
does.
     In view of the phonetic similarity and semantic relationship
of hu- and ()hau-f it is worth pointing out that they could be
derived from the same source by rules already attested in the
grammar of Hua.
     Given the sporadic appearance of a meaningless prefix ha-,
hu- could have occurred in free variation with ha#hu- (cf. pp.198-
199 ). The glide /h/ sporadically disappears between /a/ and a
following /u/ (cf. 2.10.4). Thus hatthu could be realized as
ha # u. The rule of resyllabification (55) will wipe out syllable
boundaries between /a/ and adjacent /u/, converting hattu to hau$.
Finally, stress is always retracted to the first element of a
diphthong (rule 77) . This converts hau$ to hau$, the verb stem
""please"". Having acquired initial stress, this verb stem allows
infixation and absorption of pronoun object prefixes.
     This reconstruction, while plausible, may be historically
false, and other possibilities cannot be excluded. It is possible,
though not likely, that hu- and ()hau- are simply related words
with an accidental phonetic similarity. More likely there is an
etymological connection between the two (which is different from
the one outlined here).

8.    Noun complexes
     The noun complex, like the verb complex, is a morphological­
ly defined entity, a single word. Unlike the verb complex, it is
not necessarily an immediate constituent of the sentence in which
it appears: its syntactic function is to act as the head of a noun
phrase, which is such a constituent. While a noun complex may be
a noun phrase, it may also be preceded by a number of qualifiers
which are separate words. By the criteria we shall adopt, many
of these qualifiers are themselves noun complexes, and only a
very small number of them are adjectives: nevertheless, they will
be discussed together with adjectives in section 9, below.
     The typical noun complex consists of a stem with a variety
of affixes. Section 8.1 will present an outline of the variety
of nominal stems, while 8.2 and 8.3 will deal with the suffixes
and prefixes respectively.","[271, 272, 273, 274]"
"     In this sense of the vocative, called the exclamative, the
suffix -mo may be used interchangeably with the citation suffix
-a:
   fu   -    \      \ - e       'Pig!'   (a call of alarm at seeing a pig in
              ^     '                     one's garden)8.2.7.2      The potential topic suffix -mo     The most important constraint on the distribution of this
apparently ubiquitous and meaningless particle is that it may oc­
cur on nouns only if they are performing a nominal function. This
means, first, that it may not occur on the genitive (a qualifying
case) or on the vocative (an utterance case), irrespective of
their phonological form:             Nominative :        Busa' + 0       +    (mo)
             Ergative   :        Busa' + mamu'   +    (mo)
             Benefactive:        Busa' + hi'     +    (mo)
             Ad./All.   :        Busa' + ro'     +    (mo)

             Vocative       :    Busa    + (o)   + (*mo)     'Busa!'",[305]
"
13.4    Nominalized relative clauses     Relative clauses, with relative desinences -ma'3 or   -di',
are syntactically bivalent: when followed by a head NP, they act
as qualifiers; followed by any case affix and/or the potential
topic suffix -mo, they are syntactically nominalizations, ex­
pressing a variety of subordinate clauses of time, place, and
reason.
     Such relative clauses may be followed by one of the nominal­
izing suffixes -na, -bo', or -'a, in which case they cease to be
bivalent: they may function only as nominalizations, irrespective
of whether they occur with a case suffix or the potential topic
suffix -mo.
       Thus, we find clauses of the following three types:        I.   Relative clause + NP   (Adjectival function)
       II.   Relative clause + (Case affix v potential topic suffix)
             (NB: the symbol v means ""and/or"")   (Nominal function)
   III.      Relative clause + Nominalizing suffix + (Case suffix) +
             (Potential topic suffix)            (Nominal function)The present discussion will be concerned with clauses of types II
and III. Below are listed the various combinations of nominalizing
suffix and case suffix with which relative clauses may occur.

Possibly many of these gaps are accidental: nevertheless, some
observations of a general nature may be made at once.
      Only the -di' relative may occur in the vocative case: as
noted, this constitutes some evidence that it is more ""noun-like""
than the -ma'  relative.
     A complete paradigm, in which all case affixes are repre­
sented, occurs only for -ma'3 relatives with the nominalizing suf­
fix -na.
     The suffix -na is ambiguous: as noted, it may be analyzed as
the head noun ""thing"", or it may be a derivational suffix. In
this section we are concerned only with the meanings of construc­
tions in which -na occurs with the latter function.

     Given the proliferation of forms represented in the two ta­
bles above, one might hope that the elucidation of the meanings
of the various clause types should provide information about each
of the following:         (a)    the underlying semantic distinction between the
                relative desinences -ma'3 and   -di';
         (b)    the underlying meanings of each of the nominaliz-

13.    Derivational morphology     Depending on the inflectional suffixes with which it occurs,
every nominal and verbal stem in Hua is able to appear as a noun,
verb, or adjective.
     This polyvalence, defined in the syntactic configurations I,
II, III, is predominantly syntactic: for example, a proper noun
like Kamani' may act as a sentence in the vocative case, but it
cannot mean the same thing as a verb; it cannot describe an event
or a state.
     In addition to the inflectional suffixes described in the
sections above, which create syntactic nouns, verbs, and adjec­
tives, Hua also has a relatively small number of derivational suf­
fixes which create lexical nouns and verbs. Like derivational
suffixes generally, these are of limited productivity and varia­
ble meaning.
     In opening a discussion of these suffixes, it is useful to
restate the traditional distinction that exists between deriva­
tion and compounding. Given a lexeme of the form A + B, this
lexeme is called a compound if both A and B are capable of acting
as independent words: it is called a derived form if one of the
morphemes (in the case of Hua, always the second) is a bound mor­
pheme .
     It should be noted that by this criterion, Hua is rich in
compounds, and relatively poor in derivations. Corresponding to
such familiar notions as agent and action nominalizing suffixes
(English -er and -tion, for example), Hua uses the free standing
nouns de 'man' and na 'thing1: thus, for example,  rusa 'white magic, healing': rusa     de   'medicine man, doctor';
  kakora 'initiated person': kakora     na   'initiation (ceremony)'.","[348, 349, 350]"
"No generalization which works to predict the necessity of one or
another of the enlarging suffixes is known.
     This enlarging function need not be exercised where the mono­
syllabic stem is part of a compound noun phrase, since it will
lose its stress before a polysyllable, or rob a following monosyl­
lable of its stress by productive stress rules (cf. 4.3.4.1,
4.3.4.2). And indeed, in compound nouns, neither enlargement oc-

The suffix -a is only optional, the suffix -mo prohibited.
     Nevertheless, this stress-separation function will acount
for only part of the distribution of the syllable enlargements.
Their role before the (invariably unstressed) postnominal suf­
fixes (a) - (e) above is entirely mysterious.
     Although the two suffixes are in free variation on monosyl­
lables, -a tends to occur most often on nouns uttered in isolation
(e.g. in elicitation, and in the vocative case), and is hence
called the citation suffix. The suffix -mo, on the other hand,
occurs most commonly on noun phrases in connected discourse, and
could therefore be called a connective particle. Neither of these
terms is entirely appropriate, as will emerge from a detailed
survey of the distribution of each.","[301, 302]"

THE STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE REFLECTS
       THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD,
                        HERACLITUS
                   HUA, A PAPUAN LANGUAGE OF
              THE EASTERN HIGHLANDS OF NEW GUINEA
Over one thousand languages are spoken in New Guinea: approximately
a fifth of the languages of the world. Most of them (the so-called
Papuan languages) seem to be unrelated to any others spoken any­
where. The present work is the first truly comprehensive study of
such a language.
     The chief typological peculiarity of Hua, as of hundreds of
other Papuan languages, is the existence of a ""medial verb"" con­
struction, which, in the absence of all clausal conjunctions, is
used to conjoin clauses in compound and complex sentences. Medial
verbs not only mark their own clause as non-final, they indicate
as well whether their subject is coreferential with that of the
following clause. The morphology and syntax of medial clauses
thus provides an entirely new perspective on some traditional pro­
blems in the grammar of coreference.
     Papuan languages, even more than English, are ""tense-iconic"":
other things being equal, the order of clauses mirrors the order
of the events which they describe, and coordination is hence tem­
porally (and causally) asymmetrical. There is, however, a funda­
mental morphological distinction between coordinate and subordi­
nate medial clauses: the latter are not tense-iconic, and the
events they describe are not necessarily prior to the events des­
cribed in later clauses. Moreover, their truth (like that of rel­
ative clauses and conditionals, which they morphologically resem­
ble) is always presupposed, irrespective of the status of the
final clause to which they are conjoined. This is not true of
coordinate medial clauses, which are asserted, questioned, and
denied with the final clause. The grammaticalization of this dis­
tinction sheds light on the nature of coordination and subordina­
tion, and the much-disputed distinction between presupposition and
assertion.

                       HUA, A PAPUAN LANGUAGE     The distribution and behaviour of a post-nominal suffix -mo
provides insights into the nature of topics, conditional clauses,
and functional definitions of the parts of speech. Tense iconicity
reveals a great deal about the structure of reciprocal sentences
which (in Hua at least) are clearly derived from     symmetrically
conjoined clauses. In phonology, the central rules of assimila­
tion are constrained by the universal hierarchy of sonority, which
may, however, be derived from binary features.
     These are some of the areas in which the grammar of Hua is
unusually perspicuous. But the present work aims at a standard of
completeness such that it would be a useful reference work for
research in almost any theoretical topic.
     The reader who masters the contents of this book will be able
to communicate with only three thousand people: but he will have
some understanding of the general structure of hundreds of virtual­
ly unstudied languages spoken on the last frontier of linguistic
exploration in the world.

                         ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The fieldwork on which this grammar is based was carried out over
four field trips to Lufa between 1971 and 1977, my total time in
the field being seventeen months. The first three trips were fund­
ed by the Australian Research Grants Council, the last by the Ca­
nada Council. I am happy to acknowledge the extremely generous
support of both of these agencies in presenting this book as my
justification for their quixotic investment.
     The contact language used in the first three months was Pid­
gin English, known to its students as Neo-Melanesian. My wife and
I learned this language in a crash course at the Australian Nation­
al University, taught by Tom Dutton. This was by far the most
entertaining classroom language course I ever had the good fortune
to take, and I would like to thank him for it here.
     In Papua New Guinea, we enjoyed the friendship and hospital­
ity of both station personnel and missionaries at all stages of
our work. Any field worker can appreciate the ineffable luxury
of comfortable furniture, hot showers, cold drinks, recorded music,
and English conversation after having done without them for a pe­
riod of several months. For all of these, I would like above all
to thank Peter Tarplee, formerly patrol officer at Lufa, and his
wife Roslyn.
     To the Reverend Günther Renck, I owe a professional debt as
well. Almost one thousand languages are spoken in Papua New Guinea
and most of them are unknown. In deciding to work on Hua, I chose
a dialect of one of the incredibly small handful of languages of
which a good grammar has since appeared. The Rev. Renck made
available to me the manuscript of his Grammar of Yagaria while I
was in the field, and I profited from it enormously. His depar­
ture from Papua New Guinea in 1976 ended my dialog with the only                                ix
                         ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
person who is ever likely to care as passionately about Hua gram­
mar as I do.
     My remaining, and most important acknowledgements, are to our
neighbours, friends, and informants in Kemerake and Sara villages,
who will never read these lines. Under the circumstances, fulsome
expressions of gratitude may seem rather pointless. Nevertheless,
for the benefit of future linguists and ethnographers, I would
like to record here that Lufa is a field worker's paradise. Our
Hua neighbours, without being in the least overawed by the wealthy
white couple, treated us with a tact and hospitality which we can
only envy and admire.
      From Fitome Kusiri I recorded most of my best Hua folk tales.
From Busa Hagaiteme, Frisuvi Kusiri, Kutane, and Kusiri'eva Kevao
I heard many others. As tribal elders, they were more knowledgeable
than my younger informants about aspects of Hua culture : the en­
cyclopedic information recorded in the lexicon I owe primarily to
them. Kutane in particular spoke a very rich archaic Hua      (kenaga
vedi'  Ke ""Ancestors' language""), much of the vocabulary of which
is now almost incomprehensible to younger speakers in their twen­
ties, and which is known only passively even by middle-aged men,
like Frisuvi and Fitome. From Roko Kevao and Busa, I learned about
local plants, and their medicinal or symbolic properties. (For
the scientific names of these plants, I acknowledge a debt to the
staff of the Herbarium in Lae: the fact that I do not have such
identifications for all the flora named herein is due to my own
lack of competence as a collector of specimens.)
      From Aza Kevao and Bovaza (Inapero'eva), I learned most of
what I know about Gimi; Buro Kutane taught me Siane as well as Hua.
One of the most prodigiously multilingual members of a strongly
multilingual population, Buro spoke nine local languages including
Pidgin, and took the census on which my figures on multilingualism
are based. His wife Varere, my only woman informant, taught me
Irava ge, or Chuave, a language totally alien from Hua that is
spoken by about one adult in three at Lufa.
     Otoma (Samuel) Bovaza was my first real teacher of Hua, both
in Lufa and, later, on a two month visit, in Canberra. It was
from him that I first learned about Hua conjugations, object pro­
noun infixation, and the first of the many differences between co­
ordinate and subordinate medial verbs. I also owe to him the pro­
found insight, vouchsafed after a particularly frustrating attempt
to elicit some semantic contrast between these forms, that ""You
have grammar: we just talk anyhow."" This entire book, like current                                  x
                        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
linguistic theory, is an attempt to refute such a point of view.
Many is the time, however, that, like any baffled and bewildered
fieldworker, I have been tempted to adopt it.
     Kamani Kutane, my coeval and neighbour in Sara village, has
been my major informant both at Lufa and, in correspondence, in
Canberra and Winnipeg over seven years. I find there is not a sin­
gle topic listed in the table of contents that I have not at least
checked with him, whatever my first source of information may have
been. Field work often seemed to me to consist of trying to dis­
cover what the difference in meaning could possibly be between two
forms (or three, or four) which one imformant after another had
casually identified as synonymous. I will always remember Kamani
for his thought experiments: given a minimally contrasting pair of
sentences, he would construct elaborate background stories which
would be appropriate for only one of these sentences. Eventually,
I would understand one of these, and we could move on. It was by
means of such continued thought experiments that he was able to
make clear to me the meanings of that most mysterious of all Hua
forms, the gerund in -gasi'.  I have sometimes wondered, if he were
white and I were black, and our conversations had taken place not
in a grass hut in Lufa, but in a classroom at MIT or Chicago, with
what thinly veiled contempt he, or any teacher, would regard a
student as slow as I was. I can wish my fellow linguists and stu­
dents no greater good fortune than to find a friend and teacher
like him.
     My first three field trips were completed in the company of
my wife, Anna Meigs, who was doing the research for her doctorate
in anthropology. Had she not dragged me off to the field kicking
and screaming, time after time, I would have remained an armchair
linguist all my life. For saving me from such a fate, I dedicate
this book to her, with all my love.

                           INTRODUCTION
Hua (Huva) is a Papuan language spoken by about 3000 people re­
siding in a dozen villages in the immediate vicinity of Lufa
District Office in the Eastern Highlands Province of Papua New
Guinea. It is the westernmost, and most aberrant, of a group of
dialects whose 20,000 speakers are known to linguists and to their
northern neighbours, (but not to themselves), as Yagaria. To Hua
speakers, all Yagaria dialects but their own are referred to col­
lectively as Kavo: comprehension of Kavo dialects such as Move
(described in Renck 1975) is an acquired skill rather than an auto­
matic consequence of knowing Hua. Nevertheless, Hua speakers ac­
knowledge the close similarity of Kavo and Hua in referring to them
as bgotva' ke ""one language"".
     The Hua are known to their northern Siane neighbours as Ruva ,
and it is doubtless from a corruption of this name that Lufa takes
its name. Ruva may mean something like ""origin, base, foundation""
(its meaning in some Hua compounds), and may be cognate, through
some irregular correspondence, with the name Hua. Yagaria,     pho­
netically [z y әgaria], may be a compound of the noun [zyәega] ""pos­
sum"", reference being made herein to a strong taboo on the meat
of the animal, observed both by the Hua and their western neigh­
bours, the Gimi people. The etymology of other language names is
obscure.
     The Yagaria language is a member of the East-Central High­
lands family, which includes Gimi and Siane as well as Fore, BenaBena,
and Gahuku. (Wurm, 1975). Notes on the structure of Gimi and
Siane, both of which are spoken by large numbers of people at Lufa,
are included in the appendices, section 22, p. 515-46. Good de­
scriptions of aspects of Fore, BenaBena, and Gahuku, are to be
found in Scott 1971, Young 1964, 1971, and Deibler 1976. All the
members of the East-Central family are spoken within a fairly

                           INTRODUCTIONtight radius of Goroka, the provincial capital.
     In the vicinity of Kainantu, some 20 kilometres to the ESE of
Goroka, are spoken a closely related group of languages of the
Eastern Family. Much of the linguistic research on these, car­
ried out by SIL missionary-linguists, is anthologized in McKaughan
1973. The genetic affiliation of the East-Central and Eastern
Families, recognized by A. Capell (1948-9) in a trail-blazing
study, can be regarded as beyond dispute.
     West of Goroka, there is a sharp break of linguistic conti­
nuity. Near Chimbu, 20 kilometres W. of Goroka are spoken a num­
ber of languages of the Central family, among them Chimbu, Salt-
Yui, and Chuave. A dialect of Chuave known to its speakers as
Ka Xamai, and to Hua speakers as Irava ge (Chuave ka = Hua ge
'language') is spoken at Lufa by a third of the adult population.
     Much further west, from Mount Hagen to Wabag, are spoken
languages of the Western Family, notably Enga, which with 150,000
speakers has the largest number of adherents of any Papuan lan­
guage. First steps towards the reconstruction of the ancestor
language have been undertaken by K. Franklin (1975).
     Together with the phonetically highly aberrant languages of
the Karam family (Pawley, 1966), and the isolated Wiru (Kerr,
1975), all languages of the families enumerated so far are
considered to be distantly related and to constitute the Eastern
New Guinea Highlands Stock (ENGH). The total number of speakers
of ENGH languages is put at 900,000, almost a quarter of the
entire population of New Guinea.
     The ENGH stock, together with 53 others, is now claimed to
be a part of a super-family of languages termed the Trans-New
Guinea Phylum (TNGP). The existence of this group, first mooted
in a monograph by K. McElhanon and C. Voorhoeve (1970), is accept­
ed in Wurm (1975) as a given. If genuine, the TNGP includes
over 500 languages (out of the 700 Papuan languages of New Guinea) ,
spoken from one end of the island to the other, and on the is­
lands of Timor and Alor as well. The total number of speakers
of TNGP languages is approximately two and a quarter million
(Wurm 1975: 229, 312) .
     The two hundred and some remaining Papuan languages of New
Guinea belong to half a dozen other phyla, about which virtually
nothing has been written. J. Greenberg (1971), working with very
scant and defective materials, proposed that all the Papuan lan­
guages are related not only to each other, but to all non-Austro-                                XXX

Tasmania.
     No one yet has claimed that the Papuan languages, at any­
time depth, are related to any languages of Australia, Austro-
nesia, or Asia.
     My purpose in the following introduction will be neither to
attack nor to defend the genetic classification outlined above,
which represents the ""state of the art"" at this time. Rather, I
wish to enumerate some of the structural features of Hua which
are shared by a significant number of other Papuan languages,
and to indicate their extent. The purpose of my enumeration is
partly methodological: it should illustrate the dangers of basing
genetic statements on shared typological features. More impor­
tantly, in the present context, it shows to what extent Hua is a
typical member of an enormous community of languages whose speak­
ers are found throughout New Guinea and perhaps nowhere else on
earth.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]"
"     The interrogative adjective is a compound aiga'tauva               'what
kind', where auva is the body part 'skin; body'.
       Corresponding to the punctual adverbs of time are       aituvita'
'when' (non-future) and aituvita'+'a     'when' (future). The noun
vita',   occurring in both forms, means ""time"", in the sense of
""occasion"" (French fois),   as in dakni'   vita' 'how many times?'.
 (Compare dakni'  Kuna 'how much time; how long?')     It is tempting
to find a common interrogative root *ai in both aiga'     and aitu:
the problem is that neither *ga' nor *tu are attested within any
other compounds, or on their own.
     The interrogative interjection ve may be glossed as ""Yes,
what is it?"", and is a response to calls:             - Bira + a + e          'You (unseen) over there!'
             - Ve?                   'Yes, what is it?'
278                        MORPHOLOGYA simpler, and more revealing gloss for the word is simply ""?"",
one which allows us to relate the interjection directly to the
interrogative desinence of the same form.
           SYNTACTIC DEFINITIONS OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH          279
12.   Syntactic definitions of the parts, of speech     Defining morphological characteristics of the parts of speech
were outlined in sections 6 through 11. (The limited membership
of categories other than nouns and verbs is reflected in the com­
parative brevity of sections 9, 10, and 11.)
     In Hua, as in many other languages, it is possible for nouns
to act as verbs and adjectives; conversely, it is possible for
verbs to act as nouns and adjectives. Adjectives have been de­
fined as the miniscule group of words which cannot act as either
nouns or verbs.
     In sections 8 and 9, it was shown how nouns in the nominative-
absolutive, genitive, locative, and comitative cases, could act
as adjectives, and how nouns in the vocative case could act as
verbs. The notions ""act as N, V, A"" may be defined both by syn­
tactic configurations, and by the distribution of the potential
topic suffix -mo:               Non- noun functions            Noun functions
More generally, the potential topic suffix may follow any con­
stituent irrespective of its label, occurring in a configuration
like III, and may not follow any constituent, irrespective of its
morphological label, occurring in a configuration like I or II.
Configurations I, II, and III define the syntactic categories
verb (or sentence), qualifier (or adjective), and noun (or possi­
ble topic).
     It is apparent that the morphological and syntactic criteria
for nouns, verbs and adjectives do not agree: note particularly
that the syntactic class adjective is much larger than the morpho­
logical class adjective.  Nevertheless, the disagreement is not
as great as it may at first appear to be.
     Morphological NP which act as VP occur with some of the same
inflectional endings found on VP: thus, it is no accident that
280                            MORPHOLOGY
the predicate marker -e (on vocatives), the interrogative marker
-ve, and the vocative marker -(o) (on vocatives of proper names)
are identical, respectively, to the final desinences -e^,   -ve^,
and the imperative ending   -(o).
     Conversely, morphological VP acting as NP (nominalizations),
occur not only with the potential topic suffix -mo, but with a
variety of other inflectional endings characteristic of NP as de­
fined in section 8.
     The purpose of this section will be to demostrate the coin­
cidence of morphological and syntactic criteria for nominaliza­
tions, and to justify the label ""potential topic"" marker for the
suffix -mo. In section 7.2.2.2 are outlined all the verbal de­
sinences which create subordinate clauses. They are, in order of
presentation Relative -ma'^r   Participial -Ka, Infinitive   -di',
Gerundial -mo, Gerundial -Kasi',   Purposive -mi'3, Conditional
-mamo3, Irrealis Conditional -hipana-j,  and Medial -nay.  All but
a few of these may occur with the potential topic suffix -mo.
     To deal with the exceptions first: the conditional -mamo3
may not occur with following -mo: the reason suggested is that
conditional clauses are in fact formed by a compound desinence
which itself contains the suffix -mo, and differs from relative
clauses in only this detail: relative clauses function as adjec­
tives and cannot take the suffix, while conditional clauses, se-
mantically identical, but dominated directly by the node S, are
syntactically noun phrases, and thus do take the suffix. (cf..
section 9.3.1).
     Gerunds in -mo also fail to occur with this suffix for the
same reason. They consist of the verb stem followed directly by the
potential topic suffix -mo, and are thus nominalizations. Com­
parative evidence for this contention comes from Gimi, where all
same-subject medial verbs have the form V + me {me being cognate
with Hua mo ~ me).  It is sufficient to show that medial verbs
are nominalizations to establish gerunds in -mo, which have simi­
lar functions, as comparable nominalizations.
     Finally, participles in -Ka fail to occur with -mo.  This is
predictable where they act as adjectives on a head noun Kta'
(cf. 7.2.2.2.2.1), but inexplicable where they apparently act as
nouns before 'a'#hu- (cf. 7.2.2.2.2.2). They constitute the only
mystery in this section.
     Infinitives in -di'     fail to allow -mo where they function as
relative clauses:        ebgi + di'   (*mo)     zga    'Possum which he killed'
           SYNTACTIC DEFINITIONS OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH              281
but allow the suffix where they act as subjects or objects of
sentences:  va   + di'     (mo)    soko   na   + mo       ne  +e
  sleep (inf.) (p-t.) good      thing (p.t.)    be 3 (fin.A)
  'To sleep is a good thing.'","[336, 337, 338, 339, 340]"
"
9.1.2   Definite deictics     Definite deictics express distance, visibility, and direc­
tion. The basic set of these ""positional"" demostratives is
given in the table below:                         Level                Uphill    Downhill
            Close        ma; na; ora          buga      muna
            Distant      bira;  bura          biga      minama corresponds roughly to ""this"" (closer to speaker), while na
corresponds to ""that"" (closer to hearer). Ora is a general term
in which this distinction is neutralized. Bira refers to things
not seen, while bura refers to visible things. There is some
disagreement on the meanings of the forms biga/bugaf and  mina/muna.
For some informants, the former term in each pair denotes an un­
seen referent.
     In addition to the positional deictics, there are two which
signify identity of referent to some previously named entity, ir­
respective of position. They are (ha)re'  'same' and a'ina 'this,
same'. They seem almost interchangeable, although the first
emphasises identity more than the second (""this same"" as opposed
to ""this""), and the second occurs in some idioms which are pecul-
                               PRENOMINAL QUALIFIERS                     259
iar to it: an example is the formulaic a'ina+'a na+e 'that's all'
(literally, 'it's thisness is it'), used to finish stories.
      All of the deictics of this section with the exception of
hare'  are clearly nominal expressions in that they may be followed
directly by locative case suffixes to form adverbs of place, di­
rection, and movement from:    ma +ro'          ~ ma + roga            'here, hither'
    buga+vi'         ~ buga+vinga           'into up there; up there'
    mina+roti'       ~ mina+rogariti'       'from down there'     Before all other case suffixes which confer a nominal func­
tion (nominative, benefactive, ergative, and comitative), the
deictics must be followed by a nominalizing suffix -bo1  (perhaps
cognate with the potential suffix -mo, but a cooccurring and hence
distinct entity):  Nominative : ma+bo' (+mo)                (/ma bobo/)   'this (one)'
  Ergative   : ma+bo'+mamu'    (+mo)       (/mabobamubo/)'this (one) (erg.)'
  Benefactive: ma+bo'+hi'(+mo)             (/mabosibo/) 'for this one'
  Comitative : ma+bo'+Ki'(+mo)             (/mabokibo/) 'with this one'     All of these demostrative pronouns formed by the addition of
-bo' have inanimate referents: ma+bo' 'this one' can refer to ob­
jects, events, or situations, but never persons, or even animals.
     It is perhaps for this reason that such pronouns do not occur
in the genitive case, the possessor being always, in Hua, an ani­
mate, more frequently human, being.
      All polysyllabic deictics with the exception of a'ina and
hare'  'same', form vocatives by the addition simply of the predi­
cate suffix -e (given that this suffix must follow the citation
suffix -a, the presence of this morpheme is assumed here as well,
although, since all the deictics occurring in the vocative end in
/a/, the citation suffix never appears in actual pronunciation):         mina    (+a) + e          'you down there'
         bira    (+a) + e          'you unseen person over there'     Monosyllabic deictic na means ""thus, or so"" and occurs as a
separate noun with this meaning :          na oe                    'thus I have come'
          na baipe                 'thus are you here?'
          nathie                   'he did thus'
      The other monosyllabic deictic ma means ""here"":

syntactic configuration in which they occur. In (d), it is the
anticipatory desinence which restricts the medial clause to per- -
forming a nominal function, while in (e), it is the short form of
the allative case suffix which similarly restricts the noun phrase
to which it is affixed. The syntactic status of these affixes,
like that of the final personal verbal desinence in 14.2.2 (c),
is again in marked contrast with their morphological,character.
     More complex constructions, such as the subordinate medial
verb, will be analyzed in more detail later on.

15.    Transitivity     This section deals with grammatical relations of case, and
the categories of voice, within the context of a general overview
of predication.","[399, 400, 401, 402]"
"     It seems plausible, then, that the suffix -hi',  like the
English word ""for"", is a polysemous morpheme with two apparently
separate, but in fact closely connected meanings. The fact that
it may follow medial verbs then provides further evidence that
these verbs are morphological nominalizations.
     It may be that the nominalizing element in such medial con­
structions is the anticipatory desinence, which, as noted many
times above, is morphologically similar not to the verbal de­
sinences, but to the personal pronouns. Verbal desinences have
three forms, A, B, C, where A = lsg., 3sg., 2/3pl., B = dual,
C = 2sg., lpl.; pronouns have seven forms, corresponding to each
of the different persons, three singulars, two duals, and two
plurals.
     If so, it is possible that medial verbs, and medial clauses,
could be analyzed as complements on a noun phrase head, as below:
The anticipatory desinence, morphologically the final desinence
on a verb, is, according to this analysis, the head of a comple­
ment construction.
     Once medial verbs have been identified with nominal forms,
all déverbal constructions occurring in syntactic configuration
III are analyzable as nouns: the distribution of the suffix -mo
is then justified by morphological, as well as syntactic, criteria.
     We turn now to constituents occurring in syntactic configura­
tion II. It has already been shown that no noun phrase occurring
in such a configuration may occur with the suffix -mo, and it re-
286                              MORPHOLOGY
mains only to show that no true adjective may occur with this suf­
fix either. For the sake of completeness, we shall consider not
only the true adjectives like ferafera 'big', but also quasi-
adjectives like soko 'good', deictics like ma 'this' and numerals
like rori 'two', all of which, as we have seen, are actually ca­
pable of acting as independent nouns, and thus identified as un­
derlying nouns.
     Not one of these may occur with -mo, clearly indicating that
the syntactic function of the word alone, rather than its morpho­
logical category membership, is responsible for the distribution
of the particle here (but recall that the category of morpholo­
gical adjective was defined in purely syntactic terms in the first
place: adjectives are those words which occur only in configura­
tion II.)        True Adjective : ferafera      (*mo)   fu   (mo)   'big pig 1
        Quasi-Adjective: soko          (*mo)   de   (mo)   'good man'
        Deictic        : ma            (*mo)   de   (mo)   'this man'
        Numeral        : rori          (*mo)   de   (mo)   'two men'      Finally, consider those constituents which occur in syntac­
tic configuration I. Not only do noun phrases acting as complete
utterances fail to occur with -mo. No final clause, however
marked, should   occur with this suffix either. Thus, the suffix
-mo should not cooccur with any of the final verbs listed in section
7.2.2.1. This prediction is true in every case but one:      Final           : bai - e       (*mo)
                         'He is here.'
      Interrogative   : bai - ve     (*mo)
                        'Is he here?'
      Exclamatory     :   bai - mane   (*mo)
                          'He is here!'
      Concessive      : bai - va      (*mo)
                         'He is here, but...'
      Imperative      : bai - (o)    (*mo)
                        'Stay hereI'
      Inconsequential:    bai - mana  (*mo)
                          'He is here (and a fat lot of good it does)'        The unique exception is the purposive desinence         -mi'3:      Purposive       :   bai - mi'   (mo)
                          'He is here, I tell youI'
           SYNTACTIC DEFINITIONS OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH           287
     This desinence is both morphologically and syntactically
anomalous.
     Morphologically, it is anomalous in being the only final de­
sinence to occur with a final glottal stop. Probably, as suggested
above, it is derived irregularly from a sequence of the relative
desinence -ma'3 and the benefactive case suffix   hi'.
     Syntactically, it is anomalous in being the only utterance-
forming (i.e. final) desinence which also forms subordinate
clauses (when the verb occurs with a subjunctive auxiliary, it
forms purpose clauses):           Utterance   :   bai + Ki + mi'
                           'He will be here, I tell you!'
           Subordinate :   bai + si + mi'
                           1
                             in order for him to be here'     Two anomalies do not explain or justify a third. Given what
has been said about the distribution of the suffix -mo, it should
appear on the second of these two examples, but not on the first.
Instead, it appears on both.
     Nevertheless, it turns out that it is exactly this anomaly
which provides the most dazzling confirmation for the proposed
identification of -mo as the potential topic suffix.
     Consider the claim that a syntactic configuration like III
provides a structural definition for the semantic notion ""possi­
ble topic of a sentence"". Why should this be so? What are the
criteria for topichood whereby constituents in configurations II
and I are eliminated from this status?
      The first criterion, and that which excludes constituents
occurring in configuration II, is that a potential topic must be
mmediately dominated by the node S. Now, arguments of Chomsky
;i972) / Wierzbicka (1975) and others have convincingly demonstrated
that the focus,   or comment, of a sentence, and hence, by implica­
tion, its topic also, need not be constituents immediately domi­
nated by S, or even entire constituents: indeed, they need not
even be entities susceptible to morphological description.","[344, 345, 346]"
"
7.2.2.2.3   V + di': the infinitive     The invariable desinence -di'   has two primary functions: the
first is to create infinitives, which are nominal, the second is
to create relative clauses, which are adjectival. Relative
clauses in -di ', like relative clauses in ma'3, may occur with a
variety of case affixes, and thus act as nominal expressions, but
the former may occur in the vocative case as well, while the lat­
ter may not.
     The -di' desinence, like -Ka, cannot cooccur with any future
auxiliary - compare the English infinitival complementizer to
which is also mutually exclusive with any modal auxiliary.
     The nominal use of the infinitive calls for little comment
at this time: vo- 'sleep' vo + di' 'to sleep'.
     The infinitive may also occur as a relative clause (but not
as a complement) on any head noun phrase, and differs from the
relative in -maj chiefly in its failure to indicate a number of
                          VERB COMPLEXES                        175
distinctions of person, tense, and aspect which are possible for
the relative. Thus, while the relative allows one to distinguish
seven persons, the infinitive, like forms, in -Ka, allows one to
distinguish only two:       hu + di'    na
       !
         the thing which I, you, he/she, we two, we all did'
       hi + di' na
       'the thing which we two/ they two, you all/they did1Since -di' may not occur with the future auxiliary, no distinction
of tense is possible: the result is not ambiguity, however, as
the tense reference of an infinitival relative clause is, rather
surprisingly, invariably noji-future.
     Finally, -di' may not occur with either the perfective aux­
iliary ro- or with the compound habitual auxiliary ro+hu, and
here the result is a multiple ambiguity: hu+di' na can mean not
only 'the thing which he did', but also the 'thing which he has
done', or 'habitually does'.
     An obvious use for the infinitival relative is to mark rela­
tive clauses where the nature of the subject and specific details
of the time of action are of no interest: compare do+ma' na 'that
which I ate' and do + di' na 'that which is eaten', where the lat­
ter is the term for food.
     Although both -di' and -ma'3 relatives may occur on any head
NP, only the former may occur as epithets without this head NP in
the nominative and vocative cases. Thus both (a) and (b) below
mean ""man with his anus stuck out"":      a)    ai  - 'a teri     -ma'      de       (relative)
      b)    ai  - 'a teri     -di'      de       (infinitive)
            anus his stick out (comp.) manOnly (b) is possible without the head NP de, where it is a nick­
name for a man, and can be used to refer to him or address him:                  ai'a teridi' mue
                  'I gave it to Ass-stuck-out'
                  ai  - ka    teridi    -o
                  anus your stuck out (vocative)
                  'Hey, Ass-stuck-out!'","[233, 234]"
"
13.4.9   Conclusions     Nominalized relative clauses seem to offer a proliferation
of synonymous expressions. There is seldom any difference between
clauses which are distinguished only by the nature or presence of
a nominalizer, and there is frequently no difference between
clauses distinguished by a different complementizer. Occasionally,
even case affixes are interchangeable (the only clear example of
this, however, seems to arise where the benefactive and the alla-
tive case affixes are interchangeable in clauses of reciprocity) .
     The meanings of the case affixes, by and large, are the same
on nominalized clauses as they are on ordinary nouns, but they
have a wider range and more idiosyncratic variation.

                          SECTIONS
     The underlying forms justified in the sections- dealing with
phonology and morphology are consistent and motivated. However,
they are also terribly cumbersome. Where issues of phonological
and morphological analysis are not at stake, underlying represen­
tations will be abandoned in favour of a more or less phonemic
transcription having the following properties.(a)   Only fully specified segments from the underlying inventory
      of sounds can be used to spell Hua words. This will elimi­
      nate / K / , and the reduced vowels, schwa, 1, as well as all
      the phonetically voiced fricatives.(b)   A l l sounds will be represented by the nearest equivalent from
      this inventory.    Thus, underlying / ' m / will be spelled 'm,
      but underlying / ' + r / will be spelled t, and so forth.(c)   Underlying prenasalized stops will be spelled B, D, G.(d)   Automatically preglottalized / b , d/ will be spelled b , d;

               INTRODUCTION: WORD ORDER AND CONSTITUENCY         335
14.   Introduction: word order and constituency     Since it is impossible to talk about a morphological form
without refering to its meaning, and since in Hua, as in many other
languages, a single verb may constitute a complete clause, it is
inevitable that much of part II may be viewed as a syntactic, as
well as a morphological description, of the language. Neverthe­
less, part III will be more than a review and rearrangement of
part II.
     While the morphological component of a grammar describes the
language in terms of the shape of its overt categories, a syntac­
tic description, in referring to their function, will deal with
covert distinctions. A widespread belief among linguists (which
I do not share) holds that these covert distinctions are less
idiosyncratic and closer to universal semantic distinctions than
the ones which any language recognizes at the morphological level.
My own view is that some of the most valuable insights to be gain­
ed from the present work (such as the analysis of conditionals,
coordination, and topics) are presented, so to speak, on a morpho­
logical platter: but by this, I do not mean to deny that syntactic
behaviour does provide a useful diagnostic for a number of other­
wise hidden categories.
       Accordingly, the following pages will deal with Hua grammar
in relation to such universal categories   as transitivity, tense,
mood, topic, and causation; and in relation to such universal pro­
cesses   as agreement, coordination, subordination, complementation,
and reduction under identity.
     We may begin by outlining the character of syntactic repre­
sentation to be adopted. The basic structure of a Hua clause is
given by the phrase structure rule (1):      1.   S o (NP) (NP) (NP) (NP) VPwhere VP is, like the Verb Complex, a single word, the verb. The
canonical order of constituents is then SOV. However, the state­
ment ""Hua is an SOV language"" could be more accurately replaced by
two statements (2a) and (2b), of which the second admits of fewer
exceptions than the first:      2.   a) Most clauses are subject-initial.
           b) Most clauses are verb-final.","[388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394]"
"
4.2.1.1 Constraints on syllabic codas     All syllables of Hua words, save for some obvious borrowings,
end in a vowel or vowel + glottal stop. It follows that all stems
and all suffixes in Hua are subject to the Syllable Structure
Constraint (1):        SSC.   1.   (a)   [-syll.]   o    /'/   /   $#
                    (b)   [+segment] o [+syll.] /   ([-syll.]) $ #Whether the final syllable of a word ends in -V$# or -V'$# depends
on its syntactic class, at least to some extent.
     In their underlying form, verb stems invariably end in a vow­
el: in fact, as we have seen, they invariably end in one of the
three vowels / i , o, u/. This may be stated as
        SSC.   2.   (a)   [+segment] o                    $ #
                    (b)   [-high]    o [-front] /         $ #
84                                  PHONOLOGY
      The final syllable of words indicating proper names of  people
(not geographical place names) invariably ends in - V' $#. This
is particularly noteworthy inasmuch as Hua has a large number of
proper names like English Daisy,  which are also common nouns.
Whereas the common noun in Hua may end in either -V$# or -V'$#,
the corresponding proper name invariably ends in -V'$#. The fi­
nal /'/ of proper names may thus be taken as a distinguishing
mark:        Common noun                       Proper name
        kiafuri       'yellow flower'    kiafuri'       male name
        hattvagova    'bush plant'       hattvagova'      ""   ""
                                                         !l
        butupa        'bird of paradise' butupa'             ""
        fitome'       'var. tree'        fitome'          ""   ""     SSC. 3
     [ + segment] [+segment] o [ + syll.] [glottal stop] /          $ #
     All stems and suffixes are subject to SSC. 1: so too, con­
veniently, are prefixes. If they are syllabic, they invariably
end in a vowel, or a vowel + glottal stop sequence. Thus ha#,
u' 'already', 'a'(a)   'negative', and the dual personal pronoun
prefixes ra'(a)   'we two' and pa1(a) 'you two, they two'. Non-
syllabic prefixes like d 'I', since they do not end syllables,
are naturally not subject to SSC (1).
     Further subclassification of stems is impossible: common
nouns, adjectives, and adverbs are subject only to SSC. (1). Sub-
classification of suffixes, while possible, may not be very sig­
nificant. It is possible to note, for example that possessive
suffixes, anticipatory desinences, and plural case affixes end in
-V$#, while singular case affixes end in -V'$#, but it is doubtful
that subclassifications of this sort are much more general than
morpheme-by-morpheme descriptions.
     There is, however, one distinction which is of potentially
greater significance. The final syllables of complete     utterances
invariably end in -V$#. Either verbs or nouns (in the vocative)
may act as complete utterances. Verb stems (=imperatives) invar­
iably end in one of the vowels /i,o,u/; verbal desinences which
form principle clauses suchas the indicative e , interrogative.
ve , and the concessive va always end in a vowel. Verbal end­
ings marking non-final of subordinate clauses, such as ga^ (me­
dial) , or di' (the infinitive), may end with either the glottal
stop or a vowel. Nouns in the vocative, including proper names,
lose their final glottal stop, fitome' becoming [fitome (ho)],
                            SUPRASEGMENTALS                            85
and so on.
     Since the vowel-final pattern is the result, at least in this
latter case, of a deletion process, the constraint on utterance-
final syllables applies not at the level of underlying, but of
superficial structure. It suggests, however, a possible morpho­
logical analysis of /'/ : marking proper nouns, possible on nouns,
impossible on verb stems, impossible on vocatives, this segment
/'/ marks the constituent which it ends as no more than part of a
sentence, never a full utterance in itself. Later on, we shall
see that it functions as a nominalizer.","[142, 143, 144]"
"Apparently, the root is reinterpreted as *Kovo + o, and the pro­
nouns are infixed after Kovo-.   An alternative explanation, that
the pronouns have allomorphs no-, go-, o-, etc., and are inserted
between the root and the personal endings, is supported by the
form of these pronouns in the progressive: kovo + go + mino + oe
(/kovogominoe/) 'I am hitting you', but the vowel /o/ could have
been inserted to break up the consonant cluster */gm/ (cf. a sim­
ilar case of insertion on page     ).
      The free standing pronouns are            1.     nemo
                                              1.     remo

            3.      emowhose common root emo, like Hua Kai, Gimi ge, does not occur alone.
The possessive forms of the pronouns are identical with the free
standing nominatives given above.
     Pronoun prefixes indicating possession are comparatively rare,
the common pattern being one of suffixation. The forms of the
suffixes have already been given in part (page 53 3): lsg. -ne,
2sg. -Ga, 3sg. -ra, lpl. -de, 2/3.pl.   -dina.
     For the majority of kin terms, possession is indicated by
apparent infixation: me'()vo 'father', ()o ()vo 'mother1,
                      HUA IN ITS MULTILINGUAL CONTEXT                545
kouna()vo    'agemate', za'()vo   'elder brother', momo()vo  'maternal
uncle 1 , oro()vo  'wife', va()vo   'husband', aba()vo  'namesake', and
others. Clearly, in each of these we are dealing with compound
nounds NP + vo, in which vo means probably something like ""kinsman""
or ""someone related to ego in some way"". (Compare Hua de         d+vo
 'my 'cuz''). The word vo occurs with the meaning of ""person"" in
the word oruvo 'boy', which, as in Hua, is a compound of the word
meaning 'girl' oru.
     The system of demonstrative pronouns, parallel to that of Hua,
is of no particular interest: zama 'this', ia 'that' (also the
nominalizer in counterfactual conditionals (page 541)       (o)tira
'over there (invisible)', (o)tora    'over there (visible)'     (o)tima
'down there (invisible)', (o)toma    'down there (visible)',      (o)tia
'up there (invisible)', (o)toa    'up there (visible)', na' 'which'
(adj.), ne' 'what' (adj.).

"
7.3.4.4.2   The verb does not take pronoun objects      Pronoun object prefixes are the result of agreement with a
pronoun object in the absolutive case. Of the common verbs hako-
and hagaro-   'look for' furoto- and hokuhu- 'find', and havi- 'hear',
and ri-   'take, hold, grab', all but the last are prohibited from
appearing with pronoun object prefixes for phonotactic reasons.
Pronoun object prefixes are avoided in one of three ways: the
verb takes an object in an oblique case; the verb never takes hu­
man objects; or the verb takes a support verb which may and does
occur with pronoun prefixes.
     The two verbs hako- and hagaro- 'look for' take objects in
the benefactive case. Noun Phrases of the form NP + hi' are ex­
empt from agreement:       Kgai si'      hakoe
       you (ben.) I looked for
       'I looked for you.'",[270]
"
13.3.1   Nominalizer na     The nominalizing morpheme na is actually the free-standing
pronoun ""thing"", and all cases of Root + na lexemes may be treated
as compounds. Since na is a noun phrase, it may occur as the head
noun with not only other nouns and quasi-adjectives, but also
with true adjectives. Those cases where a form A + na are simply
translated as ""an A thing"" are of no morphological interest: ex­
amples are words like nupa na 'a black thing', za'za' na 'a long
thing' and haga na 'a sweet thing'.
      It is the cases where A + na may not be so simply translated
which provide evidence for the grammaticization of this suffix.
Already noted are such nomina actionis as kakora na 'initiation'
'from Kakora 'initiated person', zga na 'possum hunt' from zga
 'possum'. Similar to these are abstract nouns like siro na and
Kopa na 'pollution' from the quasi adjective siro   'dirty' and the
noun Kopa 'menstruation'; the noun dodi'   na 'food' f rom the infi­

of the adjective, and inasmuch as the head noun does not serve to
refer:         abadekamo   fera   na(mo)      kosie

8.2.5.2   The ergative     The ergative is the case affix with which nouns occur which
are the subjects of (di)transitive verbs. It has distinct forms
in the singular and the plural.
     Following a vowel, the suffix is invariably /mu'/: de+mu'
'the man(erg.)', bade+mu' 'the man boy', kra +'di+mu' 'my dog'.
      Following a glottal stop, instead of the expected */bu'/,
the ergative suffix is phonetic ['ßamu']: [a'ßamu1] 'the woman
(erg.)', nono '+ ' dima[ ' ßamu ' ] 'my maternal uncle'. The phonetic
sequence ['ßamu'] can have three possible underlying sources:
'mamu',  'bamu' and 'vamu'.       A sporadically occurring -mamu'
ergative suffix on vowel final roots (e.g. de+mamu' 'the man'
(erg.)) can be explained as a back formation if the underlying
form of the ergative suffix following glottal stop-final stems is
taken as mamu' rather than *bamu' or *vamu'.
      The dual and plural ergative ending -mi(post-glottal['ßi]):
epva' + Ki + mi /epvagimi/ 'their fathers (erg.)'; naga' + mi
/naga bi/ 'people (erg.)' is restricted to animate nouns. Nouns
forming a true plural (proper names, kin terms, and the handful
of common nouns listed in section 8.2.1.1, above) must always be
marked for plurality if they occur with the ergative plural suf­
fix: vede+mi  (*de+mi)  'men (erg.)' epva' + Ki + mi    (*epva'+mi)
' their fathers (erg.)'. Nouns which form collectives by the suf­
fixation of vza or vutavu   may either use this suffix or not be­
fore the ergative plural: mna (+vza) + mi '(flock of) birds

(erg.)'. (This is further evidence for the contention that these
suffixes are not true pluralizing morphemes.)
8.2.5.2.1   The agreeing ergative     A feature of the ergative suffix which distinguishes it from
other case affixes is that it is obligatorily marked not only for
number, but for person as well. This is most clearly shown in the
complete pronominal paradigm, where each of the personal pronouns
occurs with a distinctive ergative suffix, an allomorph of a spe­
cial ergative suffix - ( v i b a ) m u ' :             sg.l.   dgai      +   vibamuda

               3.    vede      + mi                     'men'Note, in both paradigms, that a distinction is made between sec­
ond and third persons in the. dual and plural: no third person
dual and plural pronoun in the ergative exists, while the ergative
suffix for the third person on common nouns is distinct for dual
and plural numbers.
     It may at first appear that the agreeing ergative is in both
form and meaning a compound of the ergative suffix (mu' 'sg.1, mi
'pi.') and the pronominal appositions of section 8.2.4. For a
number of reasons, however, this analysis cannot be maintained.
     First, although both personal pronouns and common nouns oc-
230                            MORPHOLOGY
cur with the agreeing ergative suffix, neither occurs with the
pronominal apposition suffix.
     Second, from an examination of proper nouns, it is clear
that the pronominal appositions precede case affixes (including
the ergative), while the agreement morpheme of the agreeing
ergative follows the case affix. The two cooccur, but in differ­
ent slots.
     However, since these two morphemes are mutually dependent
following proper nouns, it is easy to account for the formal
identity of the two, and for their cooccurrence, by positing a
copying rule:       pronoun apposition + ergative =>         1 2 1 (Obligatory)
               1              2This hypothesis could not account for the presence of ergative
agreement on common nouns and pronouns, where, as noted, pronoun
appositions do not occur, and the rule would have nothing to copy.
     These considerations demonstrate the impossibility of iden­
tifying the second part of the agreeing ergative with the pronom­
inal apposition. Moreover, it is impossible to identify the
first part of the ergative with the ""regular"" mu' ~ mi suffix,
since the alternation is not as predicted: if the agreeing erga­
tive truly consisted of ergative + pronominal apposition, one
would expect to find the syllable mu ( ') throughout for the singu­
lar, and the syllable mi throughout for the plural. As it happens,
however, mu(') is found not only in the singular, but in the first
person of the dual and plural as well.
     Another analysis which avoids these problems, but encounters
others, is the following:
     The ergative singular suffix (which Hua shares with other
languages of the area) is mu'.  Given the sporadic alternation
/'/ ~ nar mu' could be interpreted as an allomorph of a (non-
occurring) *muna.  But this suffix is now identical with a same
subject medial verb mu- in the 3sg. A complete paradigm for such
a verb, given the general ablaut rule, and the form of the antic­
ipatory desinences, would be                         sg.    1.    muda

Given the prior existence of a plural ergative suffix mi (once
again, shared with neighbouring languages.) , an /u/ ~ / i / alterna­
tion already existed. All that was. necessary to create the new
paradigm was a reinterpretation of the basis for this alternation:  Inherited alternation            General ablaut rule

the agreeing ergative involved distribution of the forms, the main
difficulty of the second analysis involves their actual shape.
     The anticipatory desinences of medial verbs are quite simi­
lar to the pronominal appositions. Nevertheless, they are not
absolutely identical, and where they differ, the second part of
the agreeing ergative will be found to resemble appositions. The

8.2.4   Pronominal apposition     In English, the phrase ""you guys"" is colloquial. The phrase
""I, Claudius"", on the other hand, is bookish. The only difference
between the two kinds of phrases is that in the first the pronoun
is an apposition (or an article, cf. Postal 1965) to a common noun,
while in the second, it is an apposition to a proper name. In
Hua, the situation is almost the opposite: pronominal appositions
are obligatory on all kin terms and proper names, and impossible
on common nouns (except as special forms of the genitive and
ergative cases: these will be discussed in the context of the case
affixes).
     The pronominal appositions are similar to, but distinct from,
other pronoun forms:                            Í1.     da
                   singular Ï 2 .   Ka      (/ga/)
                             [3.    —
                             Í1.    ta'a
                   dual      ^ 2 . Kita'a   (/gita'a/)

                             13.
(Note that here alone, we find a morphological distinction between
second and third persons in the dual and plural.)
     These appositions follow the possessive suffix if there is
one. The morpheme immediately preceding them loses its final
glottal stop if it has one.
     The distribution and position of the singular appositions is
straightforward:  Forapi'   + da          > /forapi da/   'I, Forapi '
  Forapi'   + Ka          > /forapiga/    'You, Forapi'
  nono' -f 'Kama' + da    > /nonokama da/ 'I your maternal uncle'
  nono' + 'dima' + Ka     > /nono dimaga/ 'You, my maternal uncle'
  ete     + 'di   + Ka    > /ete dimaga/ 'You, my husband' (cf. p.
                                                               225)     In the plural, pronominal appositions and collective suffixes
are mutually exclusive: since the pronominal apposition in the
plural or dual already expresses number (as well as person), this
is not surprising. Thus, we find nono' + 'dima'  + Kita (/nono

                                        [rajf + Kita
The collective suffix Ki thus acquires the value '3pl.', and con­
trasts with Kita '2pl.'. Given the fact that the mark of the third
person is typically zero, a possible interpretation of Kita (which
may or may not be etymologically true) is that of a bimorphemic
suffix Ki 'plural' + ta 'second person', contrasting with Ki
'plural' + 0 'third person'.
     Such a (re) analysis might account for the sporadic appear­
ance of an alternative lpl. suffix rata,  speakers of which may
interpret it as ra 'plural' + ta 'non-third person'. That the ta
syllable is interpreted as ""non-third person"" rather than specif­
ically ""first"" or ""second"" person, is attested by the fact that,
for these speakers, Kita and rata are interchangeable as first or
second person plural suffixes of pronominal apposition:  nono' + 'Kama' + Kita   (/nonokamagita/) may be
   V e , your maternal uncles';
  nono' + 'dima' +rata (/nono'dimarata/ or /nono'dirata/) may be

logy of the two systems differs. In Move, both genitive and
ergative case affixes are -ma' (Renck 1975: 35), while in Hua they
are distinct (genitive -ma', ergative -(ma)mu')    . In Move, the
comitative is ' e' ~ 'ese' (Renck 17), while in Hua it is -gi'. In
Move, the benefactive is -e' ~ -se', while in Hua it is -hi'
 (Renck 1975: 36). In Move, the two ablative suffixes -loti'     and
-logati'     are semantically distinct, the former only being used
with inanimate nouns, the latter with animates. No such distinc­
tion is observed between the Hua cognates -roti ' and rogari ' (al­
though in both dialects only the shorter form is possible as the
marker of the instrumental case).
     Two of the most striking differences in the verb complex are
significant. Move has a past tense suffix du- which is absent in
Hua (although the medial auxiliary -to- may be cognate with it,
cf. 7.2.1.9.3), and Move, unlike Hua, prefixes the progressive
auxiliary verb (Hua bai: Move no).
     Equally striking, though superficial, is the absence, in Move,
of pronominal infixation on roots beginning with the sequence ha ....","[51, 52]"

so are clearly nominal complements: Kosita means 'old man', Kagia
'bald spot', KeBiri 'a stunted person'. All of them occur with

of them are able to act as the subjects of sentences.
     The verb hu- is the most interesting: in some cases, it is
obligatorily deleted, in other cases, optionally, and in yet
other cases, deletion is blocked. Constraints on deletion are in
part syntactic and morphological, but mainly they relate to the
meaning of the verb compound, and thus help us to define three
degress of adjective-ness in Hua.
     Following are a list of compound verbs of the form N±hu-

be noted that many of these verbs are ambiguously transitive or

9.3.2        True adjectives       Some prenominal modifiers occur only in attributive position
and cannot be derived from relative clauses. There are currently
three or four such true adjectives in Hua: fera'          'wild' (compare
zusathu-   'tame'), ferafera     'big', and aigava'   'false, raw' (com­
pare, however, rgi'±hu-       'be tight', whence rgi'   'true'; and also
the compound aigavasagava''±hu-       'green'). The status of a fourth
word, havana,   havaBo',    havanaBo'   'small' is indeterminate. As
adjectives, the three forms are totally interchangeable, but the
two words in final -Bo' are capable of acting as nouns meaning
""the small one"":      f   *havana
           havaBo'           havanaBo'J

           'He likes the small one. ' ^       '
     Possibly the final syllable -Bo' is cognate with the nomi-
nalizing suffix -bo', or the potential topic suffix -mo.
      In 1971, elicitation produced a somewhat larger group of
true adjectives, which included the colour terms nupa 'black'
and faipai'  'white'. By 1977, these and other quondam adjectives
were occurring as predicates with the verbalizer hu- :    nupathu-

these are truly new developments, it is quite likely that the
class of true adjectives will desappear entirely in a few more
years. It is possible, however, that the results of 1971 were
simply in error.

13.4.1.7        Conclusions     The function of nominalized clauses in the nominative seems
to be twofold: first, nominative clauses may act as the subject
or object complements of a number of verbs. But this function is
marginal compared with the most basic function of the nominative,
which seems to correspond to the ablative absolute in languages
like Latin: conditionals and topic clauses, like ablative abso­
lutes, describe some state or event which is relevant in some way
to the state or event described in the principal clause, but which
functions as a background rather than as a participant in such a
clause.","[372, 373]"

8.2.5.3.1         The suffixes of place and destination     The adessive/allative is used to describe both position and
motion towards some object or person:                                J 'at the house'                      (adessive)
  Z U + r

     The inessive/illative is used to describe both position and
motion into some object or person:    .     ., ,   . , /x J 'in the house'                                (inessive)

  aipa      + vina                'in (to) the guts'     The geographical place name suffix Kaiga 'place, part' is
mutually exclusive with both locative suffixes, with the result
that place names may act as either nominatives or locatives;
for example Fipitokaiga (the name of a place where a group of
people from Kemerake village have gardens) may be used as the
subject of a sentence, or as an adverb of place or direction:  Fipitokaiga         (briki'   Kiko'   ne)   'Fipito' (is a beautiful place).'
  Fipitokaiga         (baune)                 '(We are) at Fipito.'
  Fipitokaiga         (ue)                    '(I went) to Fipito.'

     The long and short forms of the locative suffixes are gener­
ally interchangeable. However, the long form of the locative /
allative is possible in two contexts where the short form cannot
occur.
     Locatives in Hua as in languages like English, may be used
as qualifying expressions (compare ""the man on the street""), but
the locative in this construction must be found in the long form:  zu + roga      a'   (*zu + ro'       a1)        'woman at work' (a hardworking
                                                                   woman)
  dmu'+roga   osi'    (*dmu'+ro'    osi')         'the flies on my sore'     In addition, the long form of the locative/allative occasion­
ally occurs as a topic marker roughly translatable by English ""as
for..."" :(  a'
   woman
          + roga
            (all.)               mountain
                                             mo
                                            (all.)
                                                            + ro'
                                                      climbed
                                                                                 havie   (*a' + ro')                                         (3sg.final)
  'As for the woman, she climbed up the mountain.'
     The inessive/illative occurs with one short form vi' and two
long forms vina and vinga.  Again, the long forms are substituta-
ble for the more commonly occurring short forms, but have the ad­
ditional function of being able to act as qualifying expressions:
   (hau' + Y^fl                             Ke    'A J p a i n I i n o n e ' s l i v e r '
  i         [vina     J                               (voicej
   \^(*hau' + vi')                                (=loneliness, nostalgia)       Geographical place names in -Kaiga, like locatives in the
long form, are capable of acting as qualifiers: thus, e.g.
Fipitokaiga   bai'a 'a garden at Fipito'.
     The three forms roga,  vinga, and Kaiga,  are identified as
compounds ro'+Ka, vi'+Ka,  and Kai+Ka, where the first morphemes
are the short forms of the adessive/allative, the inessive/illa­
tive, and the personal pronoun root respectively, and the second
morpheme common to them all is Ka, which has already been encoun­
tered as a nominal-adjectival suffix on verb stems (cf. section
7.2.2.2.2). The glottal stop disappears before -Ka in the ades­
sive/allative, and changes to /n/ before -Ka in the inessive/
illative. Both changes, while irregular, are not unprecedented.
The main problem with this analysis is not formal but semantic:
it is difficult to see a connection between Kai, the personal
pronoun root (""part""? ""one""?), and Kaiga,   the geographical name
suffix (""part""; ""place"").
234                              MORPHOLOGY     The lone form of the inessive/illative vina may be an alter­
nant to vi' by the same sporadic alternation of /'/ and na which
has been discussed in various contexts, earlier.
     Nouns of time, like nouns of place, do not occur with loca­
tive suffixes of place: thus, for example ega may mean either
""yesterday"" or ""(*on) yesterday"", and no form *ega+ro' or *ega+vi'
occurs.","[291, 292, 293]"
"     The existential verb can never be omitted: the copula verb
may be, apparently leaving the personal desinence as a suffix on
the predicate complement noun. Thus, the pairs of synonymous

          b) zamo     +e              (/zamae/)   'It's a tree.'

          b) zamo     -\ga+na     (/zamagana/)    ' It's a tree and so he         '     In distinguishing copula verbs from existential verbs in this
way, Hua is behaving in a fashion similar to that of many European
languages: in Russian and Huangarian, the copula verb (at least in
the present indicative) may be deleted, but the homophonous exis­
tential verb may not; in Classical Greek, the existential verb is
stressed as a verb, while the homophonous copula verb (as in
Hungarian and Russian, deletable) is an unstressed clitic. In one
way or another, the existential verb has a prominence which the
copula verb does not.
     The question remains whether in sentences (10) - (13), the
pairs of sentences are related by copula insertion (the (b) sen­
tences are basic, the (a) sentences derived), or by copula   dele­
tion (the (a) sentences are basic, the (b) sentences derived.)

                            Surface structure
The deep structure of the one derivation is equivalent to the
surface structure of the other.
     Both derivations pose an embarrassing problem for the puta­
tive distribution of the potential topic suffix -mo which is un­
questionably present in (10b) - (13b). By the criterion which
seems to govern the distribution of this particle everywhere else,
noun phrases which act as complete sentences (or are capable of
acting as such) should not occur with -mo, and in these sentences,
they do.
     It is somewhat more consistent with the theory of the distri­
bution of the particle to hold that the predicate complement za
is at no stage acting as a complete sentence. This view is best
maintained if we adopt the derivation in which the copula is
derivation in which the copula is present in deep structure.
     However, there is considerable evidence that the relationship
between the (a) and (b) sentences in the ecamples above is not
describable in terms of either copula insertion or copula dele­
tion. The (b) sentences are examples of a more general phenomenon
of what I will call S-     ellipsis.
                                 TRANSITIVITY                     347     To begin with the purely mechanical difficulties inherent in
a transformational approach, whether one of insertion or deletion.
      The orphan desinences on predicate noun phrases such as those
of (10b) - (13b) are not the same as those on reconstructed copula
verbs. In the first place, there are fewer of them: while there
are about a dozen personal verb desinence types, on predicate
nouns there are only three: final -e, interrogative -ve,  and me­
dial -ga + anticipatory desinence. Thus, for example, no predi­
cate nominal expression may correspond to the sentence Dgai   zubo
ne+hine  'It would be my house' (**dgai    zubo+hine).
     In the second place, there is no comparable allomorphy: while
the reconstructed verb would occur with the threefold desinences
-e3 -ve , and -ga , the corresponding nominal predicates occur
only with the unmarked allomorphs -e, -ve, and -ga.     Thus, corre­
sponding to the well-formed complete sentence Kgaimo aiga'       auva
demo bai+ne?  'What kind of man are you?', we find Kgaimo     aiga
auva demo+e? with the same translation. The       predicted*Kgaimo
aiga auva demo+ne is totally impossible.
     Where the negative of the copula verb is. regular, the nega­
tive of the corresponding nominal predicate is not. Corresponding
to the well-formed rubo 'a'+ne+e  'It is not an axe', we find, not
the predicted but ungrammatical **rubo 'a'+e,  but the irregular
rubo aeopa (cf. section 8.2.9.2).
     Where the copula verb is medialized and there is a cause-
consequent relationship between the medial clause and the final
clause, the medial desinence for this one verb alone is invaria­
bly, and irregularly -ma 3 (as in subordinate medials) rather than
-ga . On predicate nominals, however, the medial desinence is
invariably -ga  (which, as noted above, would exhibit no person-
conditioned allomorphy):    14.   a) Soko   demo   bai    + ma +   'da   mue
          b) Soko   demo          + ga +   'da   mue
             'He is a good man so I gave it to him.'","[404, 405, 406]"
"(A complete sentence might be Zupibo              brape?   'Did you put it in the
house?')
     In some cases, as where a nominal expression is acting as the
title or introduction to a narrative, it is clear that nothing
whatever has been deleted:      18.   Kositamo-e                      'the old man'
      19.   Zaovibo-e                       ""in the bush'     The embarrassment remains: in sentences (10b) - (13b), (14b),
and (15) - (17), a nominal expression is acting as a complete sen­
tence. No such nominal should allow the potential topic suffix
-mo.  All the nominal expressions in these sentences do.
         To remove this embarrassment, it is necessary to recognize
two kinds of ellipsis in Hua. The first, which is particular to
Hua, was formally defined in section 7.3.2.1.2.3 and occurs where
a complete well-formed sentence signals the mood of the following
sentence. The second, which is universal, and which I call 5-
ellipsis     is a practical device whereby grammatical constraints on
well-formed sentences are       broken.
     In all languages, sentence fragments are used occasionally as
complete utterances. A longstanding controversy exists as to
whether these fragments are derived from well-formed complete
sentences by rules of deletion (the transformationalist view) or
generated tels quels by phrase structure rules (the interpretivist
view) .
     Neither view is totally persuasive: there are tremendous
mechanical difficulties associated with the transformational view,
of which the greatest seems to be that the deleted context is
simply not uniquely recoverable in most cases (at least, not from
purely grammatical information); on the other hand, there is a
perfectly justified and widespread feeling that to generate
                                    TRANSITIVITY                     349sentence fragments by exactly the same grammatical machinery as is
used in the production of well-formed sentences, is to overlook a
crucial distinction between the two.
     I propose that sentence fragments, or S-ellipses, like after­
thoughts, occur as self-conscious violations of agreed rules of
grammatical structure. Their status in Hua is reflected in the
relative distributions of the potential topic suffix -mo and the
various predicate markers -e, and -vei ideally, the two should be
in complementary distribution. In fact, they may cooccur because
the former occurs on all constituents which are meant (by the
grammar) to be parts of sentences but which may be used (by the
speaker) as complete utterances. The latter occur only on con­
stituents which are actually used as complete utterances.","[407, 408]"
"     Possibly -opa(o) derives from 'a' (negative) + va(o) (con­
cessive expectant desinence) . Like most clauses in -va3, negative
predicates are followed by a balancing positive statement. (Com­
pare German nicht...  sondern.)
8.2.8.3   The symmetrical conjunctions     Noun phrases in the same case may be symmetrically conjoined
by either -ve ""non-exhaustive and"" or -Ki ""exhaustive and"". Of
these, the first is identical with, and semantically related to,
both the topic marker and the interrogative marker, while the sec­
ond is more clearly related to the collective suffix Ki, and pos­
sibly to the comitative suffix -Ki'.
     Like the topic and predicate markers, with which they are
mutually exclusive, the symmetrical conjunctions must be preceded
by either the citation suffix or the potential topic suffix on
each noun phrase to which they are affixed.
     The unique exception occurs in the idiom aunimupe   nutimupe
hie 'He snivelled and snotted', the morpheme-by-morpheme transla­
tion of which is, presumably:   ø   - auni - mu'      - ve       ø  - nuti - mu'    -   ve
   his   tears    (erg.)   and/or   his snot    (erg.)     and/or
   hi   - e
   do 3   (fin.A)This construction, if correctly interpreted, is doubly anomalous,
in that the conjunction -ve not only occurs directly after a case
250                           MORPHOLOGYaffix without intervening enlargement, but in that this conjunc­
tion occurs with a case, the ergative, with which it does not
elsewhere cooccur.
     Nouns conjoined by either -ve or -Ki must both be in the same
case: the only exception to this general rule is that -ro'  and
-vi' are counted as the same. It is thus possible to conjoin
adessive/allatives with inessive/illatives, and ablatives with
elatives. In spite of their phonetic identity, however, it should
be noted, adessives may not be conjoined with allatives, nor
inessives with illatives. That is, it is possible to say ""at the
house and in the garden"" (adessive and inessive) ""from the house
and out of the garden"" (ablative and elative), but not ""at the
house and into the garden"" (adessive and illative), or ""at the
house and to the garden"" (adessive and allative).
     In a number of contexts, the two conjunctions are inter­
changeable , yet they are not synonymous. Ki marks exhaustive
listing: A+Ki B+Ki may best be translated as ""both A and B"". Ve,
on the other hand, marks an open-ended, or non-exhaustive list:
A+ve B+ve usually means ""A and B and..."". Another important dis­
tinction between the two is that while -Ki is invariably a con­
junction, -ve is actually an inclusive disjunction like Latin vel,
or legalese and/or.   Accordingly, the string A+ve B+ve has a sec­
ond reading ""A or B or..."".
     There is evidence of a typological nature that suggests that
the correlation between non-exhaustive listing and inclusive dis­
junction is not fortuitous. In English, for example, the same
lexeme or has both inclusive and exclusive readings:   1.    Give me liberty or give me death. (exclusive)
   2.    Max or Harry will be happy to help you. (inclusive)     It is easy to construct minimally contrasting sentences that
show that the exclusive reading is forced when enumeration is ex­
haustive, while inclusive readings are possible only when the
enumeration is not:   3.    Do you want tea or coffee?   (non-exhaustive enumeration)
   4.    Do you want tea or coffee?   (exhaustive enumeration).","[308, 309]"

8.1.1     Pronouns        The free-standing personal pronouns in Hua are                     Singular            Dual    Plural
                1. dgai             1. ra'agai   rgai
                2. kgai           2/3. pa'agai   pgai
                3. KaiIt is easy to analyse these as bimorphemic words, consisting of
the personal pronoun prefixes (cf. p.199 ) and an invariable root
Kai,  Unfortunately, this root does not seem to occur either in
isolation or with any other affix which would allow us to identify
its ""underlying"" meaning in Hua. It is possible that the root oc­
curs as the first syllable of Kaiga,    a suffix added to proper
names to mark them as geographical place names (e.g. Huva + Kaiga
'Lufa', or, literally, 'Hua place').
     Before a number of suffixes, among them the citation suffix
-a, the restrictive quantifier Ko' 'only', the potential topic
marker -mo, the ergative case suffixes -mu' and -vibamu', and the
216                            MORPHOLOGYcomitative suffix -Ki'  'with', the pronouns occur in the form
shown. Before all other suffixes, they add a final glottal stop,
which is then absorbed into the suffix by one of the rules of
coalescence (e.g. Kai' + ro' becomes /kaito'/ 'to him' by rule
(12); Kai' -f hi1 becomes /kaisi 1 / 'for him' by rule (16).) The
existence of two forms Kai ~ Kai'    '3sg.', etc., will be considered
as an example of the phenomenon of the fleeting glottal stop (cf.
2.2.3.4).","[274, 275]"

15.6        Ergative and nominative     There are in Hua, as in English, a number of verbs which are
invariably intransitive (like o- 'come'), a number which are in­
variably transitive (like mi- 'give'), and a number which are
ambiguous (like ebgi- intr. 'fall, hurt oneself tr. 'hit').
A representative list of such ambiguous verbs may give some idea
of the extent of the phenomenon:                           Intransitive        Transitive

     suhu          'sink'               'cover up'     A two-word sentence like Buro' bkaie is thus potentially
ambiguous, and can mean either ""Buro drowned"" or ""Buro swallowed
it"".
     This ambiguity may be tolerated, to be resolved by the con­
text in which the sentence is understood. Alternatively, it is
possible, though not necessary, to effect a disambiguation by the
use of the ergative case inflection (apparently the one   optional
case affix in Hua). The subject of a transitive verb, but not of
the corresponding intransitive, may appear with the inflection
-mu' (post-glottal stop -mamu').  Burobamu' bkaie can mean only
""Buro swallowed it"".
     Since word order in Hua is relatively free, three-word sen­
tences are also potentially ambiguous: Buro' fumo ke   may mean
either ""Buro saw the pig"" or, less plausibly, ""The pig saw Buro"".
Once again, this ambiguity may be tolerated, to be (almost cer­
tainly) resolved by the context, or, once again, it is possible
to effect a disambiguation by marking the subject with the er­
gative case affix. Thus, Buro' fumu' ke, in spite of the word
order, can mean only ""The pig saw Buro"".
     This, essentially, is the extent of ergativity in Hua. Not
only is the ergative inflection optional, however, there are other
factors which weaken ergativity in Hua to virtual insignificance.
     It should be the case that subjects of transitive verbs alone
are allowed to appear with the ergative inflection. Subjects of
intransitive verbs should not. Verbs with no internal structure
that are transitive, it is true, do not occur with the ergative:

15.4   The syntactic structure of ()to-   support     The support verb () to-, as a prefix-carrying quasi-auxiliary,
has been put to three uses in Hua:
(a) it follows ordinary transitive verbs like iro-     'leave', and
    hakri-  'hide', which for phonological reasons cannot allow
    prefixed pronoun objects (section 7.3.4.2);
(b) it follows normally introverted transitive verbs like vo-     ""lie
    down', and (ku')vai-     'put on (clothes) ' which have an object
    distinct from the subject (section 1 5 . 2 . 2 ) ;
(c) it follows verbs which have an unstressed benefactive pronom­
    inal complement (this section).
The common syntactic function of the verb in each of these cases
is readily apparent: it allows the expression of a pronominal
object (distinct from the subject) on verbs which, for a variety
of reasons, do not generally appear with such objects. But the
nature of the ()to-     support construction is not such as to shed
much light on this function.","[413, 414]"
"
7.3     Verbal prefixes     Hua is a predominantly suffixing language. There are few
prefixes, and those which exist are often either indistinguish­
able from independent words on phonological grounds, (e.g., pre-
nasalization of /b,d/ takes place word-initially and after pre­
fixes) , or are anomalous (e.g. personal pronoun prefixes are asyl -
labic, the only morphemes in the language which are).
        Verbs in Hua occur with the following four sets of prefixes:
      a)   the negative 'a' or   'a'a;
      b)   the perfective u' 'already';
      c)   the meaningless prefix ha-;
      d)   the personal pronoun prefixes which mark objects on tran­
           sitive verbs.
All of these but the first occur on nouns as well as verbs. Their
relative order when they cooccur before verb stems is given by
the formula
      Verb Complex o (perfective) (negative) (ha) (pronoun) V
but there are complications which will be elaborated in the sec­
tions which follow.",[252]
"Although the sentence fragment is usually the complement of a cop­
ula, it may be any nominal expression in any case but the genitive
or the vocative - in fact, any nominal expression capable of oc­
curring with the potential topic marker -mo.  It may even be the
conditional clause in -mamo3: himamo+ga+da 'He did and I...'. I
will argue that this is in fact the origin of all the subordinate
medials, which share with coordinate medials the fact that they
are causally related to the following clause, but in almost all
other respects are identical in their meaning with conditional
clauses.
     A natural introduction to this topic, and a concluding obser­
vation on causal relations, is this: coordinate medials differ
from conditionals even where both function as hypothetical protases,
insofar as the former cannot translate ""even if..."" clauses while
the letter can.
     Conditional ""if..."" clauses in most languages are morphologi­
cally similar to, if not absolutely identical with, ""even if....""
clauses, although there is a rather important semantic distinction
between them: ""If S1, S2"" usually asserts the existence of a causal
relationship between S1 and S 2 and is interpreted in ordinary lan­
guage as ""If S 1 , S2"". On the other hand, ""Even if S1, S2"" asserts
the non-existence of such a relationship (contrary to justifiable
expectations, it is true).
     Hua has no word corresponding to ""even"", and literal transla­
tions for ""even if..."" clauses are accordingly difficult to elicit.
But a reasonably close approximation to such clauses can be trans­
lated. ""Even if S 1 , S 2 "" is not very far away from ""Whether S1 or
not S 1 , S 2 "". In both cases, what is asserted is the more or less
surprising irrelevance of S1 to S 2 , and the absence of a causal
relationship between them:

          b) Whether or not you run away, you can't escape.","[469, 470]"
"
13.3.3.2        On deictics     Most deictics can occur with a locative suffix to form ad­
verbs of place and direction. With all other case suffixes, they
must occur with the nominalizer -bo': ma + ro' 'here', but ma +
bo' + 0 'this (one)'.
     There are, however, two deictics, on which the preferred
nominalizer is -'a. They are a'ina  'this, same', and aiga'
'which':        With locative case              With other cases
        aiga'     + ro'   'where?'      aiga'   + 'a + ø   'which one?'

suffix can and does occur after -'a, which seems, in this context,
to have no specific meaning:                    *ma      + bo'   + ro'             'here'

of dai'a    'much, many, plenty'. One of these quantifiers,  fubi'
 'all, every', cannot function as a free-standing noun without it:

status in a) allowing the potential topic marker to follow them,
b) resembling the personal pronouns. The anticipatory desinences
in Gimi do not resemble personal pronouns, but, like their Hua
counterparts, may be followed by the potential topic marker
ve.  Same-subject medials in Gimi have no anticipatory desinence,
but rather the invariable endings -me (almost certainly cognate
with the Hua gerundive complementizer -mo ~ -me) and      -gatono/gate,
already alluded to in the discussion of ablaut phenomena. (Pos­
sibly the -gatono morpheme is cognate with the Hua auxiliary of
limited duration -goto, which is confined to same-subject medial
verbs. It should also be noted here that possibly the Hua       -goto
form is related to the iterative V+go'  V+go'    (to) form, the lat­
ter being translated in Gimi by V+ ga V + ga + gatono,  with the
528               APPENDIX: THE LINGUISTIC LANDSCAPE
same meaning of repeated action: mi + ga mi + ga gatini translates
bai + ge' bai + ge   teta 'they stayed and stayed and they ...'.)
       As in Hua an enormous number of verbs have the internal struc­
ture NP+ ho-, among them kegeho-     'worry, grieve', kogiho- 'laugh',
kasiraho-   'abstain, fast', kineho-   'run away, be afraid o f ,   kuri-
ho- 'be heavy', and others.
     In Hua, there are five sets of morphologically similar person­
al pronouns: prefixes, possessive suffixes, appositions, free­
standing pronouns, and anticipatory desinences on medial verbs.
All of these but the last are found as pronouns in Gimi as well.
     No distinction is made between 2. and 3. person in the dual or
plural. The free-standing pronouns consist of the pronominal pre­
fixes on an invariable and untranslated root, ge, which may be cog­
nate with the corresponding Hua gai . The prefixes (already given,
page 524) not only act as the objects of transitive verbs, but,
again as in Hua, as the possessors of inalienably possessed nouns,
such as va' 'tooth'.
     There is some question as to whether the 3sg. pronoun is a-
or ø. A reinterpretation may be underway whereby a-, presently in
a paradigmatic relationship with the other prefixes, is being
treated as part of the root to which it is being affixed. As a
consequence, there is no distinction made now between agaie   'he
sees him' and agaie 'he looks, is careful', although the former
occurs with a direct object, and the latter does not.
      While there is disagreement as to the forms of the prefixes on
both verbs and nominal roots, there is complete agreement as to the
forms of the free-standing pronouns in all persons: 3sg. age, 2/3.
dl. rigi,  2/3pl. igi are invariable, as are the unproblematical
nege 'I', kage 'you', regerege   'we two' and rege 'we'.
       Pronoun appositions could be elicited only for the lsg. form
-na:   aza+ na miri + ove 'I am (I) Aza'.
     Similarly, I was able to elicit only lsg. possessive suffixes
-ne' and -na, possession being elsewhere indicated by the genitive
form of the free-standing pronouns: ru + ne'+ve hanie 'My axe
exists; I have an axe.'.
     The case endings are very closely parallel to those of Hua.
For convenience, they are compared with their Hua congeners in the
table below (all forms occur in both a post-vocalic and a post-
glottal form, the form shown below being the former):                          Gimi        Hua

such as gi 'people1, only -su may occur: vana+ mosu 'man's'; vana +
misu 'men's'; gi + su 'people's'. (Note that gi is cognate with the
identical form in Hua, acting as the collective suffix.)
     The allative ra(i) ~ (ta(i)) can be made into an adjective by
the addition of the suffix -isa: kama' + ra 'here'; kama' + ra + isa
vana 'a man from here'.
     An allomorph of the ergative singular -mamo occurs on proper
names, kin terms, and the interrogative pronoun kega 'who': vana +
mo 'man(erg.)'; Aza + mamo 'Aza(erg.)'; na + va + mamo 'my father
(erg.) ' .
      The vocative -o as in Hua is confined to proper names and kin
terms. On proper nouns, the suffix -ve (post-glottal alternant
-re!)  occurs: Aza + o 'Aza!'; Kama' vana+ ve 'You man!'; Kama' ara'
+ re 'you child!'.
     The potential topic suffix ve ~ (pe) corresponds in its dis­
tribution to its Hua counterpart -mo, occurring after all case
affixes but the genitive and the vocative: Buro+ su (*ve)  ugunu
(ve) 'Buro's pig'.
        The restrictive quantifier -ga exactly translates Hua                  -go':
vare'   + ga na+ ove 'I eat only wallaby.'•
     The interrogative -mo+ ne (/mone ~ mane/) has its counterpart
in Gimi -re: komo' vana+ re '(what about) that man over there?'-
     As in Hua, there is a profusion of collective suffixes. Rath­
er than venture on an uninformed explication, I indicate some Hua -

530                      APPENDIX: THE LINGUISTIC LANDSCAPE     Demonstratives distinguish up and down, here and there, but
but do not seem to make any distinction between visibility and in­
visibility (it must be admitted that this last may be very marginal
in Hua also): kara' and ke' both correspond to Hua na 'that'; kama'
to Hua ma 'this'; kerne' to Hua bura, bira 'there, yonder'; komo'
to Hua mina muna 'down there'; avere' to Hua biga, buga 'up there';
and ara' to Hua a'ina 'this, same'. All may function as nouns in
the vocative: kerne' + re 'You over there!', and in the locative
cases: kerne' + rai       mi (ri)    + gate   atarug(e)ove   'I will stay over there
and come up.'.
     Hua has two copula and existential verbs no- (inanimate) and
bai- (animate). Corresponding to these Gimi has hani- and miri-.
There exists a third, invariable root re- which.occurs only in neg­
ative statements of existence, in which context it is interchange­
able with hani-: one' ka + re = one' ka + hanie 'there is no water'.
      In Hua, it seems that the copula verb stem may be omitted,
leaving the final or the interrogative desinence on the nominal
predicate. There are arguments in favour of this position, of
which the strongest is the identity of the post-nominal predicate
markers and ther verbal desinences. There are, however, also argu­
ments against it, most notably the fact that predicate markers
occur on Hua nouns which never could have acted as complements of
copula verbs. In Gimi, the arguments against a transformation of
copula deletion are stronger, inasmuch as the predicate indicative
and interrogative markers on nominal predicates are not even sim­
ilar to the verbal desinences as which they (by the deletion hy­
pothesis) originate. The indicative predicate marker is -ve (post-
glottal -re), but the interrogative marker, rather than *-vo, is
-ve also (post-glottally, -pe): Narepa+ ve? '(Is it) a casuarina?';
Narepa + ve '(It is) a casuarina.'; Nama' + vi' + ve? 'In the house?';
Nama' + vi' + ve 'In the house.' The last two, phonetically, are
/namapipe/    and         /namapire/.
       The negative predicate marker in Gimi is -pao (following ve),
or -amupa (following the bare nominal root): humi + ve+ pao ao'
