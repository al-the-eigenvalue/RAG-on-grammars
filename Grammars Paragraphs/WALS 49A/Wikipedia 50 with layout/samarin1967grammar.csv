"       These are called ""personal pronouns"" for their referents are almost ex-
clusively human beings.      It is perhaps more accurate to describe them as
pronouns for animate beings.      Although the third person forms lo and âla
are occasionally used for inanimate objects, this use is obviously quite
unusual except for lo s6 discussed below.        It is due perhaps to the influence
of other languages, French or the native languages of the speakers of Sango.
In the latter case the personal pronouns are light-heartedly used for in-
animate objects (which otherwise have no pronominal substitutes).        In the
former case one may assume that a bilingual is translating the French pro-
nouns 'le, la' and 'les.'      It should be said that pronominal reference to
inanimate objects is simply avoided in Sango, and where bilinguals feel
inclined to use one, they choose the adjunctive ni (q.v. 4.21.20) rather
than the personal pronouns.      The normal ""substitute"" for at least some con-
structions with a pronoun is like the following:        téné ti kobéla 'the subject
of the sickness' : téné ni 'the subject of it, the subject.'
               lé ti kâ ni aeke kôtâ ni,           'The surface of the wound was
                ni laâ si lé ni amû. fadé            large, and that's why the
                pepe.                                wound did not heal quickly.•       7.12.    It is uncommon for personal pronouns to be used when a person's
statement is being quoted.      Second or third person pronouns, singular and
plural, are replaced by the adjunctive ni (q.v. 4.21.20).        The substitution
of ni for these pronouns (most commonly lo and âla) is also made to avoid
ambiguity.      The one place where ni does not replace a pronoun in quoted dis-
course is when the pronoun stands in isolation.        It is then followed by the
sentence particle o (q.v.       8.10   ).   All of these uses are illustrated below.
          1.    lo tene ni yi ti goe ape.          'He says that he doesn't want to
                                                     go.' or 'He says, ""I don't
                                                     want to go.""'
          2.    lo yi ti mû bongô ti ni na lo.     'He wanted to give his (i.e. his
                                                     own) clothing to him (i.e.
                                                     another person).'
137;                                                                         7.10         3.    lo tene, mbi o, nx eke goe na         'He said, ""Say there, I'm""going
                gala.                                  to the market.""'       7.13.   The plural pronouns—x commonly and âla rarely—are also used to
anticipate the plurality resulting from the combining of two singular pro-
nouns or a singular pronoun and a singular noun.          Put into literal English,
one says 'we and he' instead of 'he and I.'          These coordinate phrases occur
almost exclusively as pre-clausal subject constructions in which case the
verb has its own subject in the form of a plural pronoun.           For further dis-
cussion see 12.12.10.
         1.    fadé î na mo, x dé bâ da     -C29      'You and I will take an oath
                                                       about it.'
         2.    x na lo, x gâ na Bambari     -139      'He and I, we came to Bambari.'
         3.    x na mamâ, x gâ   -N8o                 'Mother and I, we came.'
         4.    mbi yx kâtârâ tî x na âla agâ          'I want your village and mine
                 taâ kâtârâ   -R3                       (i.e. our village) to become
                                                       a real village.'
         5. rabi na lo, âni goe      -L11             'He and I, we went.*
         6.    lo na âla ake sâra kusâra     -Rio     'He and they were working.*       7.14.    The one pronoun which is regularly used for inanimate objects but
in a restricted way is lo.       In a deliberately light-hearted or humorous way
one can refer to almost any inanimate object with lo.           This use compares with
that of the noun zo 'person' in the same way;           e.g. mû na mbi zo sô 'Give me
that thing' (instead of using yx 'thing').          Bilinguals in French also use lo
as an object of a verb in spite of the general pattern to avoid pronominal
reference in this position.         When lo is followed by the adjunctive sô, it is
also used to identify any object, animate or inanimate, singular or plural,
as something which was just mentioned or is just about to be mentioned.              It
most frequently occurs in identificational or equational sentences, with the
verb eke or without any verb whatsoever.           The omission of lo, leaving so
(which is grammatically possible) changes the meaning.           Moreover, while
similar in meaning to a construction with laâ (q.v. 8.13), it is both
semantically and grammatically different.           For example, koa tx mbi laâ means
'That's my work (which I've just described).'           But koa tx mbi lo sô can mean
that as well as 'This is my work (which I'm now going to describe).'

7.2o. S u b j e c t m a r k e r       The verbal prefix a- is considered a pronoun only for convenience.                  It
differs more from the personal pronouns than it is similar to them.                 Like the
personal pronouns it functions as the subject of a verb and in some instances
it can substitute for any other grammatical subject (q.v. chp. 13).                 It is,
in fact, a generalized subject marker.               Its four distinctive characteristics
are the following:
                1.    It occurs only immediately preposed to verbs where it marks
                      the subject of a predication.
                2.    It never takes any modifiers of its own.
                3.    It is obligatorily redundant with any grammatical subject
                      except unmodified personal pronouns.          Pronoun phrases (q.v.
                      10.20) are followed by a-, but a single personal pronoun is
                      not followed by a- except in the speech of certain individuals
                      who disavowed fluency in Sango.       One was an Igbo-speaking
                      person from Nigeria and the other was a speaker of a ""Bantu""
                      language from the Berberati area.
                4.    It is used without limitation whatsoever for animate or in-
                      animate objects.
These characteristics are syntactic in nature, and it is because of them
that a- is considered a prefix.                Since a- is syntactically ""bound"" to the
verb, it is represented as if it were phonologically bound to it.
1.39                                                                                    7.20
       7.21.        The following discussion is taken up entirely with the non-redundant
use of a- (i.e. where there is no other grammatical subject).                   The redundant
use of a- (i.e. where there is already another grammatical subject) is illus-
trated not only by the short text analysed below but also in chp. 13 where
different kinds of grammatical subjects are described.                  It is appropriate to
note here in passing that there are instances where a predicative verb (i.e.
one which is not in a ti phrase, q.v. 9.2o) seems to have no immediate gram-
matical subject at all.              This may be more apparent than real, for the prefix
a- is sometimes of such short duration and weak articulation that it seems to
be missing.          Nonetheless, there are enough such omissions that one must reckon
with them.          Unjustified on any grounds, however, is the omission of a- in the
Protestant literature in such an environment as following a plural noun subject.","[162, 163, 164, 165]"
"      The use described under (c) is achieved by repeating the main verb of
the clause in the nominalized form (ex. 2 3-3o).             It can be looked upon as a
form of reduplication.       Like reduplication in so many languages in the
world this one too has the function of an augmentative (like 'very') or
intensifier.    Another use is that of excluding events other than the one
specified by the main verb.       The -ngô nouns with this function can im-
mediately follow the main verb or be separated from it by other complements
in the verb phrase, but in no case does it ever take any modifiers (as a
noun would)    or complements (as a verb would).

no means an obligatory category.             The plural marker is being called a prefix
only because it is morphologically bound to other words.                But since there is
no phonological reason for describing it as an affix, and since there are
other words in the language which sire morphologically bound to other words,
such as tx, it is obvious that its description as an affix is arbitrary.
6.4o                                                                             1 32-Even where there is reference to specific objects whose number is known,
plurality is not necessarily marked.         No attempt is here made to predict the
occurrence or non-occurrence of the plural marker in the language except for
the following general remarks.          It appears that if the number of the objects
is known, or assumed to be known, the marking of plurality is avoided.               On
the other hand, redundancy occurs in the noun phrase where plurality is marked
both by â- and by a postposed noun modifier such as the numerals, mingi 'much,'
and kôé 'all.'     What is more significant is the fact that it is the animate
nouns, rather than the inanimate ones, which are most frequently pluralized.
This tendency to avoid the pluralization of inanimate nouns is, incidentally,
characteristic of some other languages of the area, e.g. Gbaya.               But these
can not be made responsible for this feature in Sango, for it is found in too
many texts of different people.          Some examples of pluralized animate and in-
animate nouns are ex. 1-12.","[157, 158]"
"      11.12.     The category of modifier complements deserves some attention.
It may be said to include broadly those complements which modify the verb
itself in some formal manner analogous to the adverbial concept of European
languages.      The inclusion of so many complements under one head is justified
on three grounds;
      1.     In only some cases are the internal distinctions, such as time,
place, and manner, regularly correlated with formal criteria.            As will be
seen from the examples, some of these sub-functions are served by various
construction-types, and some construction-types serve different sub-functions.
      2.     In many instances, the criteria are purely semantic, so that there
are numerous borderline cases or cases of apparent overlapping which would
preclude clear analysis at the grammatical level.
      3.     There are a number of miscellaneous modifiers which do not fit
semantically into any of the major divisions.          If one were to follow the
semantic distinctions entirely, the number of different kinds of complements
would be quite indefinite, depending upon subjective criteria of meaning,
which preclude contrastive distinctions.",[209]
"      There is one typical ambiguity possible between possession and equation,
in particular when nouns designating human beings are used.           Thus, the fol-
lowing illustration might be construed either way;
5.6o                                                                                102-

                                             'this child (which is) a female.'
In practice, however, the context almost never leaves any genuine ambiguity
in interpretation,

        2.     âmbéni adu mérengé ti wâle         -Li?    'Others bore girl children,'
         3.    kôtôrô ti Republique                       'the country of Central

         5.    kôli ti ita ti mbi ti wâle ni              'the husband of my sibling (who
                                                           is) a female (i.e. my sister)'       5.61.13.    Attributive complements may be classified generally as either
objective or subjective, according to whether the head noun or the comple-
ment expresses the, characterizing feature.              A second classification, which
cuts across the previous one, distinguishes between qualities- and processes.
There is thus a four-way classification;             the head noun is a trait of the com-
plement' (ex. 1)5 the complement is a trait of the head noun (ex, 2-7)5 the
head
       noun affects the.complement in some manner (ex. 8—9)5 and the complement
in some way affects or effects the head noun (ex. 10-13).               In a number of
these cases (ex. 1), the head is actually an adjunctive rather than a noun,
but it is substantively used.
       Just as there is potential ambiguity between possession and equation,
there is also potential ambiguity between possession and attribution, as is
seen from the following illustration, which may be construed two ways;
              mabôko ti wâle                 'the hand of the woman* (possession) or
                                             'the left hand' (attribution).
Just as in the former case, however, the ambiguity is more potential than
real, since the context almost invariably clears it up.
       In two categories, that in which the head is a trait of the complement,
and that in which the head is affected or effected by the complement, the
latter is often a pronoun.         In the first case, the proportion is 9 out of
28, but in the latter it attains 115 out of 172.               This frequency of pronoun
complements is a peculiarity of the possessive and attributive categories.

"     Part II, Word Classes, describes the six classes of words in the language
(presented in alphabetical order):      adjunctives, connectives, nouns, pronouns,
sentence particles, and verbs.     Included in this part are the three affixes
which exist in the language:     the pluralizer â- and the nominalizer -ng6 (both
under nouns) and the subject marker a- (under pronouns).      Since morphology plays
so little role in Sango, the criteria for the determination of word classes
are principally syntactic:     they are grouped according to their distribution

with respect to each other and with respect to their function in various types
of constructions»     Interjections should be added as an additional class of
words, but they are not specifically treated in this grammar.","[19, 20]"
"      10.14.    Somewhat different are nouns derived from verbs by the addition
of -ngô (q.v. 6.30).       In most cases, phrases in which a nominalized verb is
the head are substantive phrases (ex. 1-2).            But in a verb phrase, and intro-
duced by ti, the nominalized verb is indistinguishable from a plain verb
(q.v. chp. 9).     The nominalized verb after a verb is a verb intensifier
(q.v. 11.16).     In any case, such complements as may accompany the nominalized
verb are verbal complements:             objects, na-phrases, modifier complements, etc.,
so that internally the phrase with a nominalized verb as its head is con-
structed like a verb phrase (q.v. chp. 11).

lustrated below (ex. 1-2).          Or they may consist of a pronoun and sô 'this'
(ex. 3), or a pronoun and an adjunctive such as kôê 'all' (ex. 4), or a pro-
noun and both sô and kôê (ex. 5).             The pronoun may be followed by a ti-noun
phrase (ex. 6) or by a ti-adjunctive phrase (ex. 7).               A pronoun may be fol-
lowed by a relative construction (q.v. 4.23.10), as illustrated below
 7.20                                                                             172 x(ex. 8).      Several adjunctives, among them veni 'himself' and ngâ 'also' may
follow the pronoun directly (ex. 9-11). Finally, there are phrases in which
a pronoun is joined additively to another pronoun or to a noun by na (ex.
12-14), and phrases in which a pronoun is in apposition to a following noun
phrase (ex. 15-16).        In such cases, when a pronoun is joined to a noun, the
pronoun always comes first.           It may also be said that ""pronoun"" subsumes
certain pronoun phrases, and ""noun"" in the additive and appositive construc-
tions subsumes noun phrases, so that the resultant phrase may be quite long
(ex. 15).

"     4.23.10.       Because so is used in constructions which are easily trans-
lated by an English clause with a relative pronoun, it is convenient to
talk about the ""relative"" use of this adjunctive.          It would be wrong, how-
ever, to equate sô with English or French relative pronouns.            Such an error
would certainly lead to incorrect uses of sô.           (Instances of the interference
of French relative pronouns in the speech of bilingual Centralafricans are
noted below.)     The relative use of so is nothing more than a substantive construction
which is followed by a modifying clause.           The word so is to be construed as
belonging to the substantive phrase, from which it is rarely separated by
pause in any case, except where French seems to be interfering.            E.g.
             zo          sô    ahinga     mbêti       'whoever knows how to reàd'
            'person this       knows      paper'
In isolation this construction would mean 'this person knows how to read,'
but the context would determine whether such a construction were a clause
in its own right or whether it were simply a substantive phrase.              E.g.
4 .20                                                                                 48        mbi hinga mbéni zo sô ahinga mbéti            'I know someone who knows how to

"      Since in some cases, clauses may follow each other without any con-
nective,     it is necessary to consider what kinds of clauses may follow co-

"      5.61.    As was shown above, the construction in which a noun phrase is
 joined to its head by tx is by far the most common usage of tx (2281/2945
 occurrences).    The head may be a noun (2170 occurrences), or a verb (72 oc-
 currences).    There are also 29 cases in which there is no head present.
These phrases are called connective phrases (q.v. io.4o), and they invariably
 function as if there were a head noun, that is, they function substantively.
7.2o                                                                                     100 t        5.61.10.     In noun phrases, a ti-noun phrase complement may express a
wide range of relationships, including possession, equation, attribution,
location, time, and others.         As with na (q.v. 5.52„2o) these categories
are semantic, and are not in every instance mutually exclusive or free from
ambiguity.     They are therefore useful as an indication of the range of uses
of ti rather than as a strictly grammatical classification.","[125, 126]"

The Sango language    Sango is the lingua-franca of the Central African Republic, one of the
few indigenous lingua-francas in Africa.       Arising out of the Ngbandi dialects
at the upper Ubangi River, it has spread throughout the country and into
neighboring areas.   There is a growing awareness of and pride in Sango as a
national language.   Although Sango does not have official status, it is used
by government, both orally and in writing, for the popular dissemination of
communications of all kinds.   Among government officials, even at high levels,
Sango is used along with French.   It is also used in commercial establishments
below the level of administration, and is the only African language used on
the government-owned radio in the Central African Republic.       It has not been
used in public education up to the present, but it serves as a tool for basic
education (by the missions) and its use in general elementary and mass educa-
tion in the future is still under discussion.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"
"       The general pattern is the following;      stress occurs on any monosyllabic
word and on the first syllable of polysyllabic words, without any change of
phonemic tone.        The statement about tone must be modified to account for
                  =
the word pepe (         ape) 'negative marker' which can take stress on either or
both syllables and the tone of which is also changed.

3.4o. French influenced       What has been already said about Sango intonation is probably the
""normal"" pattern.     Stress and rising glide are also characteristic of a
minor type of speech, one which is not correlated with any indigenous ethnic
group but rather with people who have worked with French-speaking Europeans.
Among them a final stressed vowel with high-falling glide (marked here by *)
or a final rising contour like the question one (no. 1 above) is quite com-
mon.   These features seem to have no contrastive or expressive function.
Rather, they are imitative of certain intonational features of French.

    The adjunctives are those words which, like English adjectives and ad-
verbs, can enter in subordinate endocentric construction with another word.
They might be said to ""modify"" nouns, verbs, a n d — i n one case—another ad-
junctive.     Although they resemble school-grammar adjectives and adverbs in
function, it is probably ill-advised to so name them, because Sango ad-
junctives differ from each other not by morphological features but by syntactic
distribution.    Moreover, there is so much overlapping between the subclasses
that a definite division between a class of adjectives and a class of adverbs
at the moment is impossible.    It must be said, however, that it is not at
all unlikely that further work would help to make subclassifications in some
respects considerably neater.","[54, 55, 56]"
"       5.61.20.    A ti-noun phrase may, in a verb phrase (q.v. 11.14), serve
several different functions.          It may be a copulative complement (ex. 1 ) or
an object (ex. 2).         In addition, a ti-pronoun phrase may serve as a subject
intensifier (ex. 3).           In all of these cases, one may supply a noun of vague
semantic content as a sort of putative head without changing either sense
or syntactic function, but this is in no sense necessary.                      The construction
without any head noun is termed a connective phrase (q.v. 10.4o).                          It is
of frequent occurrence, and is complete in itself.

the subject of a verb (ex. 1), or, on the other hand, it may (ex. 2-4) enter
into a pre-clausal construction (q.v. chp. 12).           In this latter use, it may
indicate time or some other circumstance affecting semantically the follow-
ing verb, or it may be an expansion of the subject.           A special use is in a
sort of comparative construction with tongana (ex. 5).            There are also a
few examples (ex. 6) in which a ti-noun phrase enters into non-verbal con-
structions (q.v. chp. 14).        As with other uses of such connective phrases
(q.v. 10.4o), in every case these phrases are used substantively.

(ex. 2 5-29) or be introduced by some pre-clausal element, which may be
relatively simple (ex. 3o-34) or complex (ex. 35-36).          Such clauses may in
turn be followed by others introduced by various words, such as si, fadesô,
and fadé (ex. 37-43).

awe is in construction with a principal clause, it does not affect a sô
""relative"" clause (q.v. 4.23.10) which may be included in a noun phrase
9.30                                                                            166,which is part of the clause (ex. 44-45).              On the other hand, awe may be in
Construction with such a relative clause, in which case it immediately follows
it (ex. 46-47).      In one instance, so introduces a subordinate clause preceding
a principal awe clause (ex. 48).           In some cases, awe is in construction with
a complex of clauses (ex. 49-52).           In some of these cases, while there may be
grammatical uncertainty about how many clauses are in construction with awe,
there is no practical semantic difficulty.             Finally, there are a number of
cases (ex. 53-57) in which it is difficult if not impossible to assign the
terms principal and subordinate in their classic meanings, though the semantic
content is not ambiguous.      It may be that the clauses are in reality separate
sentences.

     The substantive phrase is a syntactic category.               That is, the term
designates a category of constructions which may function as nouns in a
clause.    Basically, the substantive phrase is a phrase which may function
as the subject or object of a verb.          It includes noun phrases, in which a
noun is the head? pronoun phrases, in which a pronoun is the head? ad-
junctive phrases, in which an adjunctive is the head? and connective phrases,
in which ti is followed by a substantive or verb phrase.               In the following
paragraphs examples of such phrases are enclosed within braces { }.","[190, 191, 192, 193, 194]"
"       5.32.21. The force of locative na can be made more specific by the
addition of one of a number of nouns which help to define the locus of the
action, the whole construction being a sort of prepositional expression.
The idea of direction of the motion or of position as such is carried mostly
by the verb, but a classification according to the verbs used is not nearly
as clear nor as meaningful as the one based upon the following noun.          These
77                                                                          5.30nouns have their own specific and concrete lexical meanings, and may with
these meanings be introduced by na.    But in the idiomatic constructions they
lose this specific meaning.    Some of these conventionalized nouns are names
of parts of the body, some refer to well-defined places.       As in many
languages, some expressions can bear notions of both location and time.
This is the case especially with na pekô ti, which can mean both 'behind'
and 'after,' in such a way that the distinction is not always apparent.
But there are many unambiguous cases which oblige us to set up a time
category as distinct from the locative idea.     Here are the principal con-
ventionalized nouns which express locations
            bé 'middle,' na bé ni 'at the center of' (ex. 1)
            devant (<Fr.), na devant 'in front o f   (ex. 2)
            gbé 'underpart,' na gbé ni 'underneath' (ex. 3)
            gigi 'outside,' na gigi 'outside' (ex. 4)
            lé 'face,' na lé ni 'on the surface of' (ex. 5)
            li 'head,' na li ni 'on top of' (ex. 6-8)
            mbâge 'side,' na mbâge ni 'beside' (ex. 9-10)
            ndé 'top,' na ndô ni 'on top of' (ex. 11-12)
            ndo 'place,' na ndo sô 'here' (ex. 13-14)
            nduzu 'sky,' na nduzu 'up' (ex. 15-16)

            sése 'ground,' na sése 'down' (ex. 22-23)
            téré 'body,' na téré ni 'beside' (ex. 24-25)
            yâ 'belly,' na yâ ni 'inside' (ex. 26-29)
            yângâ 'mouth,' na yângâ ni 'at the edge o f    (ex. 30)     A few other words seem almost at the point of being likewise conven-
tionalized in construction with nas     da 'house' (ex. 31), kôtôrô 'village'
(ex. 32), lege 'road' (ex. 33), ngonda 'bush' (ex. 34).","[102, 103]"
"      In phrases in which the complement is an adjunctive, the head may be
a noun, as it is in 48 out of 59 examples.            In this kind of construction,
the adjunctive may express some kind of attribution (ex. 1-3), a temporal
relation (ex. 4), a sort of demonstration (ex. 5), or an interrogation
(ex. 6-8).     In the one instance in which it follows a nominalized verb
(ex. 8) it expresses an interrogation.           In the example where it follows
another adjunctive (ex. 9) it expresses an attribution.             Of the two cases
in which ti-adjunctive follows a verb, one expresses interrogation, and
5.6o                                                                                108the other time (ex, 10-11).           In all seven of the cases in which the ti-
adjunctive has no expressed head, it expresses time.                Some of these (ex.
11) enter into verb phrases, some (ex. 12) are in pre-clausal constructions,

               awe     -15 5       5.63. Similar to the preceding constructions in ivhich a noun complement
was joined to its head by ti are those cases in which the complement is a
nominalized verb (74 cases).            Where the head is a noun (29/74 cases), the
nominalized verb expresses such notions as purpose, occupation, activity, and
so on, and may be considered a noun of action.              In these cases this con-
struction closely resembles the noun phrase.             The head noun may bear either
a subjective relationship to the nominalized verb (ex. 1 ) or an objective
one (ex. 2). It may also express place or time (ex. 3-4).                 The same thing
is true of the single example of a phrase with an adjunctive head (ex. 5).
But when the head of the phrase is either a verb or a nominalized verb
(45/74 cases), it is very hard if not impossible to discover any significant
difference between the construction with a nominalized verb as complement
and that with a verb.          Thus the following two illustrations would seem to
1Q9                                                                                  5.6obe exactly equivalent;
                lo goe tl mû kéké
                                                    'He went to get a stick.'
                    lo goe tl mungô kéké
It behaves in every way like the other, and serves the same syntactic func-
tions, as a complement of purpose (ex. 6-9), or a copulative complement after
eke 'to be' (ex. 10).         They may occur immediately after the verb (ex. 6-7),
or be separated from it by various other complements (ex. 8-9).","[133, 134, 135]"
"       Where occurrence preceding the clause or within the clause is optional, one
suspects stylistic differences.      Perhaps the word ""emphasis"" best characterizes
many of the pre-clausal occurrences, especially when these are joined to the
clause by laâ and si, but precisely what this ""emphasis"" amounts to and when in
fact it is operative are questions oftentimes difficult to answer.         As far as
I can tell the following two sentences are identical in meaning.          If there is
a difference in stylistic meaning, I do not know what it is.
              lâ kôê | mbi bâa lo na galâ
                                               }   'I always see him at the market.'
              mbi bâa lo na galâ | lâ kôê o       Undoubtedly some pre-clausal constructions which can also occur in the verb
phrase can be explained by saying that a long, clumsy, or ambiguous verb phrase
is broken up by pre-posing one of its constituents to the whole clause.            The
following sentences may illustrate such a splitting-up:
         1.    na kôtôrô ti i, i eke goe na         'Where I come from (lit. in my
                 gbânda (not;   i eke goe na          village), we go hunting with

                                                                            227 13.3012.3o. Types     12.31.    Subject elements are either simple personal pronouns, personal
pronoun phrases (consisting of either a pronoun and an adjunctive or pronouns
in a coordinate construction), nouns, or noun phrases.         In every case the
pre-clausal element is followed by the true subject of the clause nucleus
which is always a personal pronoun.       The identification of the element as
pre-clausal is, in fact, made on the observation that the subject marker
a- (q.v. 7.2o) does not occur.       Nouns and noun phrases (ex. 7-10) are fol-
lowed by the singular or plural third person pronouns (i.e. lo or âla).
Noun and pronoun coordinate phrases (ex. 6-7) are also followed by the re-
capitulating use of the plural pronouns (q.v. 7.13).         Where a pronoun is
repeated in the subject of the nucleus and where a personal pronoun is used
instead of a- as the subject, one suspects that the function of the pre-
clausal construction is emphasis.

"       Occurrences of n o m phrases united by na include pronom + na + pro-
n o m (ex. 1-6), pronom + na + n o m phrase (ex, 7-11), n o m phrase + na +
n o m phrase (ex. 12-25).     In only t\-/o cases (ex. 26) does a pronom fol-
low na after a n o m phrase.     Series of n o m phrases may be joined with
na at every transition (ex. 29-31), or with na occurring at only some of
the transitions (ex. 32-33).        In a few cases (ex. 27-28), some other
element, such as an adjunctive or an object, may intervene between the
first n o m phrase and the na which introduces a second n o m phrase.         When
the first n o m phrase of two united by na is introduced by ti, the ti
may be repeated with the second n o m phrase (ex. 20-21), or it may be
omitted (ex. 18-19).      The tx is never repeated when one or both of the

(18/28 occurrences).      In 11 cases, a subordinating na precedes the first
noun phrase (ex. 22-23), in which case it may be construed as introducing
the entire construction consisting of all the noun phrases joined by co-
ordinating na.","[96, 97]"

    The verb phrase consists of a verb, with or without complements.                  It is
used in two ways.       With a subject and/ or subject marker a-, the verb phrase
is the predicate of a clause.            Without substantive subject or a-, and intro-
duced by ti, it is a constituent of another verb phrase or of a noun phrase
(q.v. 10.10).    Approximately 13 percent of the verb phrases in the corpus
comprise only a verb (q.v. chp. 9).              This verb may be simple, consisting of
one stem, or compound, consisting of eke 'to be,' gâ 'to come,* or goe 'to
go' with another verb.         This unmodified verb phrase (ex. 1-12) is especially
common in series of verbs which are closely related, as for example!                  lo
lôndô lo kpé 'He got up, he ran.'
       1.   mbi te alingbi na mbi ape             -A44   'I ate, it wasn't enough for me.

other than the head verb.       In dealing with complements, it is necessary to
distinguish clearly between their form and their function, since some con-
struction types serve more than one function, and since some functions are
served by more than one construction type.          The two concepts coincide only
partially.","[200, 201, 202]"

which can be translated by 'but, however, yet, but in other words, hut it
turns out that,' etc.        It always precedes verbal predications.    The preced-
ing construction can be either another clause (uttered even by a different
speaker in a dialogue) or some other construction in a single sentence.            But
there is not enough data on the latter use to permit greater precision of
statement.

corpus, and being found in only 5 different texts.        It has two distinct
uses.     On the one hand, in 7 instances it introduces the apodosis of a con-
dition contrary to fact or uncertain to the speaker, as in the sentence:
... wâle tx mbi aeke na kâtârâ, ka mbi na wâle tx mbi x causé...           '[If] my
wife were in the village, then I and my wife would chat, [but she isn't].'
In these, t^e protasis is introduced by tongana in 2 cases (ex. 1 - 2 ) , by the
combination/tongana with intervening pause in 1 case (ex. 3 ) , by nothing in
3 cases (ex. 4-5), and in 1 instance the protasis is not expressed, being
included in a previous speaker's utterance in a conversation (ex. 6).             The
other use, of which 5 out of 6 examples occur in one conversational text,

at the end of the sentence, and seems to introduce the idea of 'didn't it'
or 'isn't it,' with emphasis or a sort of surprise.        In four instances (ex.
7 - 8 ) tl^e clause involved is verbal, and in 1 (ex. 9) it is non-verbal.

5.3o. mais, na       5.31.   The connective mais (from the French) has only one function,
i.e. to join a clause (including verbless predications) to a preceding
clause.    Some of these clauses might possibly be constituents of a single
complex sentence, but most of them seem to be independent sentences; no-
where does mais join clauses in such a way that they can function again as
a single construction which can take awe or pepe (q.v. 9 . 3 0 , 8 . 1 2 ) .   The
clause which is introduced by mais can be related to the last one uttered
by another speaker in a conversation.        All of this is reminiscent of
French mais.     Like it Sango mais can be said to have the force of an ad-
versative correlative meaning 'but.'        This is its usual function, but
there are many sentences where it seems to have no meaning different from
na as a coordinating connective.      In some places mais is even followed by
another connective.","[91, 92, 93, 94]"
"       The plural prefix occurs with the following substantives:                 nouns (includ-
ing personal names and nominalized verbs), ante-noun adjunctives when they
are used substantively, and the substitute yç 'what?'                  (These are illustrated
by ex. 18-20 and 21-24 respectively.)                By ""occur"" is here meant ""to be in
immediate construction with;!' the use of â- in a noun phrase is further
treated below.       The use of â- with personal names adds the meaning 'so-and-so
and those accompanying him' (a feature which is not only characteristic of
Gbaya but also of some other African languages).                The pluralization of yç has
the meaning 'whatever things, any other things, so forth' and comes at the
end of a list of things.

 can occur in one of several places in the following ways (illustrated by
 ex. 25-36):
                                 â + Adj. + N

                                 â + Adj. + â + Adj. + N
 The most characteristic use seems to be that of the single preposed â-, re-
 gardless of the number of modifiers.            The other uses occur almost exclusively
 in the radio texts.        25.   lo béni âfini zo sô         -Rio            'He blessed these new men.*

                                     P R O N O U N S7.10. Personal pronouns        7.11.   The personal pronouns are neatly contrasted for singular and
plural and for three persons in singular number.        For singular number there
are mbi 'first person,' mo 'second person,' and lo 'third person' (variant
pronunciations of these are summarized in the chart below).        For 'first person
plural' the most common forms are é and i.       The quality of the é form is
higher even than the vowel in such French words as dé 'thimble.'         Sometimes—
i.e. in the speech of some speakers—it is almost like the vowel in English
'it.'    But it never approaches the vowel e.       It is this latter fact that re-
quires the normalization of the representation of the pronoun as x and not
as ê.     'Third person plural' is âla.","[159, 160, 161]"
"        Occasionally these clauses are introduced by some connecting word, a
practice which, in the case of que, is obviously due to the influence of
French (ex. 55).        In the case of tongana (ex. 29) the evidence is not quite
so clear, because a native word is used in what appears to be an unusual
manner.    Because it was used by a bilingual in French, I should say that this
is evidence for loan translation.        Other than these few instances of que and
tongana, there are, of course, no conjunctive means of joining the clauses
under discussion.        But there is what one might call a functional equivalent.
All the verbs except zxa 'to let' and yx 'to want' can be followed by atene
which introduces the following clause.        The similarities between ex. 36 and
ex. 29 above should be noted.        Both are the utterances of a single speaker
in the same text.

                 -N35        15.21.12b.     Lexically marked subordinate clauses occur before the main
clause and are introduced by tongana, quand même (or simply même), and sô.
Since tongana and sô were extensively treated in 5.81 and 4.2 3.4o, no further
discussion is required here.        The meaning of quand même is 'even if' and
differs from tongana in being more emphatic.        There are, however, sentences
to which quand même appears to add no meaning, but this is what one might
expect from people who were learning a new word, especially one from a
language they did not know.

10.50. Adjunctive phrases    Adjunctive phrases may consist of a simple adjunctive (q.v. chp. 4), as
illustrated below (ex. 1)„     More commonly, the adjunctive is followed by ni
(ex. 2), which may in turn be followed by so (ex. 5), or by an adjunctive
such as kôé (ex. 4).    It may be followed by a relative construction (ex. 5).
In some cases, the head adjunctive is followed by a tx-noun phrase (ex. 6-7),
a ti-pronoun phrase (ex. 8) or a ti-adjunctive phrase (ex. 9), where the
idea is that of attribution, as shown under ti (q.v. 5.61.15),
       1.   ayi tx mingo {mbéni}, {mbéni}       'They wanted to extinguish

       2.   {sioni ni} laâ     -R2              'The evil (thing) is this.'
       5.   {otâ ni sô}, lo commencé ti         'The third (year) he began to

10.4o. Connective phrases     Connective phrases used substantively are different from any of the
above, in that the connective by itself can never function substantively.
One can supply a vague filler head noun, such as yi 'thing' or téné
'affair,' but this cannot be used as a classificatory criterion.       The types
which are found in substantival functions are ti-noun phrases (ex. 1-2),

phrases (ex. 6).

"     15.21.11.    Coordinate clauses are either sequential or additive.     15.21.11a.    The term ""sequential"" is meant to cover not only those cases
where clauses are truly sequential in time but also those cases where
simultaneous action is implied.    A few examples of opposition are included
here (ex. 38-4o) because they are doubtful;    i.e. one can supply either
'and' or 'but' in the translation.    Most of the examples of sequential co-
ordinate clauses involve a limited number of verbs, mostly verbs of motion,
all of the subjects of which are the same.    These verbs are gâ 'to come,'
goe 'to go,' kxrx 'to return,' and lôndô 'to arise' (q.v. 9.22).      Also oc-
curring sequentially are the verbs de 'to remain,' mû 'to take,' and tene
'to say.'     The first three verbs of motion (i.e. gâ, goe, kxrx) do not
necessarily indicate real motion.    The verbs gâ and goe might perhaps be
described as functioning as ""auxiliary"" verbs, for they seem to prevent one's
taking the following verb aoristically.    For example, in the analysed text
(q.v. chp. 17) sentence 53 has the following complex clause;      yâ tx mbi nî
agâ a-diminué awe     'My abdomen came and receded.'   That is, as a result of
taking a treatment the abdomen, which had become inflated because of liver
fluke disease, had been restored to normal size.       The verb diminué (<French)
by itself would imply some other thought.     While these observations obviously
lack precision, I nevertheless feel that the data warrant a tentative
15. 20                                                                        220exploration albeit at this date a subjective one.          The verb kiri 'to return,*
on the other hand, requires some translation such as 'again' or 'as for....'","[245, 246]"

13.10. Pronoun subjects     Pronoun subjects only may be preceded by pre-clausal anticipations (q.v.
12.31).    The subject may also be semantically reinforced by a phrase yx tx +
pronoun or tx + pronoun, which usually occurs in the verb phrase (q.v. 11.15),
but in a few cases occurs in the pre-clausal slot.           Pronoun subjects are al-
most always simple pronouns (ex. 1-11).           A few instances occur of pronoun +
adjunctive forms (ex. 12-15) and pronoun + s6 forms (ex. 16), of pronoun
joined to pronoun or noun by na (ex. 17-18), and of a noun in apposition to
a pronoun subject (ex. 19).         These occur almost entirely in radio texts, and
involve primarily the pronoun âla.

"13.20. Noun phrase subjects      Noun phrase subjects may consist of simple nouns, either singular (ex.
1-3) or plural (ex. 4-5), or of a noun-noun construction (ex. 6), or of a
noun and a ti phrase (ex. 7-20).     In this latter case, there may be up to two
successive ti phrases (ex. 17-20), in which case the object of the second ti
is usually a pronoun.    Some are pronouns and ti-verb phrases (ex. 21).       The
phrase may consist of a noun and sô (ex. 22-23), or of a noun and a relative
construction (q.v. 4.23.10), ae shown below (ex. 24-26).          There may even be
combinations of these, in which case the phrase may be very long (ex. 27).
Nouns formed of verb and nominalizing suffix -ngô can serve as subjects, in
which case they may still be followed by the kind of complements (e.g. objects)
which are appropriate to verbs (ex. 28-29).       One instance (ex. 30) occurs in
which a verb without -ngô serves as a subject.        1.   {mamâ} agâ amû mbi akiri na          'Mother came and took me and

      The corpus on which the analysis of sentence structure is based con-
sists of approximately 1641 sentences (Anecdotes 542, Conversations 250,
Fables 135, Interviews 243, Letters 45, Narratives 28o, Radio (148) from
36 different texts (in which there are approximately 17,844 words). The
choice of these texts was determined in part by a desire to have a fairly
representative sample of spoken Sango and in part by what was available in
the files at the time when the analysis was made.
     The number of sentences analysed is approximate in more than one sense.
The real problem here is the determination of what a ""sentence"" is. In a
written language (i.e. in a written sample of a language with a tradition
of writing) the identity of a sentence is easier than it is in spoken,
especially extemporaneous, language. In the latter informal speech one tends
to find clauses strung along, fused, and intercallated in ways which are very
different from those which characterize the written texts, even informal, of
the same language. English, much to the dismay of school teachers, is no
exception.
     These observations are made to indicate that it is very unlikely that
the s.yntax of Sango is ""worse"" than that of a similar text from a person
with an equivalent education. Moreover, since Sango is a lingua-franca, it
undoubtedly has no stylistic traditions, no standards of eloquence. In a
certain sense it is true that the people ""just talk."" But all ""talk"" has
some kind of structure or else it would not be a realization of language.
It is the purpose of chapters 14 and 15 to describe the syntactic aspects
of this talk.
     This is not to say that all samples of Sango are equally good. Even
though I am no native speaker of the language, I think that I am, as a re-
sult of extensive exposure to the language and intensive study of its struc-
ture, somewhat qualified to judge certain texts in some way better than
others. The better ones I should say are more amenable to description.
An example of bad syntax is sentence 35 in text R4a (q.v. chp. 18). The
only feature which seems to require that these strings of clauses be united
as a single ""sentence"" is the fact that they are preceded and followed by
terminal pause. The internal structure is almost beyond description. Much
of the radio texts are of this type. On the other hand, I judge that C31
and N81 are fairly good examples of conversational and narrative texts.
     In the identification of sentences, therefore, we have used as criteria
both intonation, structural cues, and sense. Intonation is not always help-
ful, of course, for a person can use a terminal pause and then decide to
215By definition any normally produced utterance (i.e. anything except fragments
produced by hesitation phenomena such as stammering and groping for words)
can function as a sentence.   A single interjection, a name or title used in
direct address, a fraction of a sentence—any of these can constitute non-
verbal sentences.   Of more interest, however, are those non-verbal sentences
which are true constructions because they consist of two elements having a
specific relationship to each other.   These are discussed more fully below.","[240, 241]"
"      11.16.     The verb intensifier is nothing more than the nominalized form
of a verb used in a verb phrase to reinforce the verb (q.v. chp. 9).           It
implies either a simple intensification of the action, or an exclusion of
any other possible action, as if to say 'he did this, and not something
else.'    Finally, it is possible in some cases to discern an idea of process
or duration in the action.         Several examples are given below.

they are not introduced by a connective, they serve as the predicate of a
clause.       In this use, there is almost always an expressed subject, if only
a-, but in certain ""imperative"" occurrences there is no expressed subject.
This use is illustrated in a number of examples (ex. 1-4).",[219]
"     The modifier complement may be a verbal adjunctive (ex. 1 - 3 1 ) , which may
or may not be followed by other complements.            It may also be a connective
phrase, with teneti, ngbangati, and tongana (ex. 3 2 - 3 8 ) .       It may be a noun
phrase, expressing time when the head noun is lâ 'day' or ngu 'year' (ex.
39-44) or some other semantic categories with other head nouns (ex. 45-46).

separately below in 1 1 . 1 3 .    The same is true of ti-verb phrases, in 1 1 . 1 4 .

is extremely prevalent (q.v. 5.32.20) as is seen from the statistical tables
at the end of this chapter.        Many verb phrases contain two or three na phrases.
These serve as modifier complements, and may be roughly divided into several
semantic categories, the precise shade of meaning depending of course upon
the verb and the noun involved;        place or direction (ex. 1-12), time (ex. 13),
accompaniment or possession (ex. 14-19), benefaction (ex. 20-33), manner or
instrument (ex. 34), end goal (ex. 35-36), and so on.        Though these divisions
are in most cases clear, there are some cases of borderline indeterminacy, so
that this presentation is intended rather as an indication of the range of
values of the na phrase than as a grammatical classification.           Sometimes, na
is omitted, but may be supplied.        Where this is the case in the examples, na
is inserted in parentheses.","[210, 211, 212, 213]"
"        The same reasons as are adduced for ngbangati make it inadvisable to
consider teneti as being the head noun téné and the connective ti.                              These are,
briefly?        the frequent presence of pause between teneti and the preceding
verb phrase, and the fact that it would make ti introduce clauses.                              Further-
more, a literal translation of the noun would in most instances be an absurd

conventionalized.      It should also be noticed that the tones of tene are not
high as they are with the noun téné.             The above-mentioned pause occurs be-
fore teneti in 32 per cent of the cases in which the following construction
is a phrase, and in 88 per cent of the cases in which the subsequent con-
struction is a clause.           Of these last, 48 per cent are sentence breaks.         In
one instance, there is no pause before tsnsti, but there is pause im-
mediately after it, while in one case there is pause both before and after.","[117, 118]"

erally stand behind the noun they modify.     As with ante-noun adjunctives some
of these too can function substantively and as verb modifiers (marked again
with * and 4 ) . Two of them (viz. ngâ 'also' and tongasô 'thusly') also have
the characteristic of being able to stand at the head of a clause in an
introductory position (q.v. chp. 12).     The latter word may be the result of
adding so to another word, but since tonga otherwise does not occur alone
(since it bears no meaning relationship to the connective tongana, q.v.
5.80), it is considered a single word and written as such.        Special atten-

nouns it serves as a determinant which is restrictive or anaphoric or both.
As a pronoun its most common use is in indirect discourse.        An enlarged dis-
cussion follows.","[63, 64]"
"      The topic in a laâ predication may be a substantive phrase (q.v. chp.
10), including a noun phrase (ex. 1-6), a connective phrase (ex. 7-9), or a
pronoun (ex. 10-12).       It may be a clause (usually only one) preceding laâ
(ex. 13-19).   Finally, it may be the adjunctive ni (q.v. 4.21), in which case
the referent is in the preceding discourse (ex. 20-25).         The ni may be con-
sidered to replace a whole clause.      The particle may be followed by the post-
posed sentence particles ma (ex. 25), and ape or pepe (ex. 2 6), or by the
adjunctives so (ex. 27), tongasô (ex. 28) and mbirimbiri (ex. 4), or by awe
(ex. 29).",[179]
"      5.61.14.   Two categories may profitably be discussed together, those of
place and time.     Both may also be expressed by na complements, but with a
distinct difference in nuance.      It may be said that the na phrase expresses
an accidental or incidental place or time relationship, while the ti phrase
expresses a much more essential relationship, with the idea of relative
permanence included.     Compare the examples given below;
            zo na Bangui 'a man in Bangui'          vs.
                       zo ti Bangui 'a man of Bangui'
            kébe na lâ kâî 'food in the evening'            vs.
                       kôbe tî lâ kux 'the evening food.'
In fact, the relationship of the na phrase to a preceding noun is so tentative
that if there is any verb in the vicinity, the na phrase will relate to the
verb, while a tî phrase remains related to the noun.                 Locative ti phrases are
illustrated below (ex. 1 - 3 ) , as well as temporal phrases (ex. 4-5).

less frequent in the corpus,              (a) There is, for instance, what may be termed
the ""topical complement,"" following such nouns as téné 'word' or the French
nouvelle.     Here, ti may be translated 'about' or 'concerning' (ex. 1-3).
(b) Then there is the ""relational"" or ""functional,"" in which a head noun
designating an animate being is related by ti to a complement designating an
activity, an institution, etc. (ex. 4-5).                (c) There is what may be called
the ""destinative,"" in which ti may be overtranslated as 'designed for' or
'destined for' or 'used for' (ex. 6-9).                id) There is a group of examples in
which there is a basic concept of quantity, including the notion of price
or value (ex. 10-11).

 is so conventionalized that the entire construction may be termed a ""pre-
 positional expression.""            In most instances, na precedes the first noun, but
 in some cases the na is omitted when the noun has a close conventionalized
 relationship with a preceding verb.            The nouns which are so used are;
              devant (<French) (ex. 1)
              gbé 'lower part' (ex. 2-5)
              lé 'face' (ex. 4-5)
              lége 'path' (ex. 6)
              li 'head' (ex. 7-8)
              mbâge 'side' (ex. 9)
              ndô    'top'   (ex.   10-11)              ndo 'place' (ex. 12)
              pekâ 'back' (ex. 13-14)
              pôpô 'middle' (ex. 15)
              téré 'body' (ex. 1 6 - 1 7 )
              yâ 'belly' (ex. 18-19)
              yângâ 'mouth' (ex. 20)
 The resulting na phrase (q.v. 5 . 3 2 . 2 0 ) enters into a verb phrase as a modify-
 ing complement (q.v. 1 1 . 1 1 ) ,     with an idea of time, place, manner, means, and
 so forth.

"      10.12.    Another broad class of noun phrases consists of a noun followed
by a phrase comprising ti and a noun, a pronoun, or an adjunctive (ex. 1-7).
The ti phrase involved may, as is shown elsewhere (q.v. 5.6i.io), indicate
possession, equation, attribution, destination, location, time, and so forth.
In some cases, especially those which appear to be compound nouns (q.v.
6.20), the ti may be omitted without change of sense (ex. 8-11).      It is the
fact that ti may be inserted so readily, as well as the fact that compound
words are otherwise unknown in Sango, that leads to the description of these
constructions as phrases.

"     11.11.     The object of the verb needs little explanation, as it coincides
closely in Sango with the notion of the object in many other languages.         As
was suggested in the table above, the object may be a substantive phrase,
such as a noun phrase (ex. 1-5) or more than one noun phrase (ex. 6), a
pronoun phrase (ex. 7), or a phrase consisting of ti and a noun, a pronoun,
or an adjunctive (ex. s).     It may be an adjunctive (ex. 9-11) or a clause
(ex. 12-18).     In more complex verb phrases, the object m a y b e followed by
an adjunctive (ex. 19-30) with or without further complements.       Or it may
be followed by a na.phrase (ex. 31-45), or a tx-verb phrase (ex. 46-47), or
by a substantive phrase, usually a connective phrase, serving as a modifier

(ex. 53).

"       4.41.    The adjunctive gî 'only' is the most frequently occurring Au and
the one with the widest range of occurrence.      It is found with nouns (ex.
1-4), with pronouns (ex. 5-6), with verbs (ex. 7, but this is the only
63occurrence in the corpus), with connectives (ex. 8-11), and with various
other adjunctives (ex. 12-18).     In some instances it is probably more ac-
curate to interpret it as a mark of emphasis rather than trying to translate
it with 'only' or some such word.

                                  C O N N E C T I V E S    The connectives are those words which, like the prepositions and con-
junctions of school grammar, relate words or constructions to other words
or constructions.    The currently-used term ""function word"" applies to them
also.    They are not subdivided into various kinds of ""prepositions"" and
""conjunctions,"" because such a classification would not fully reflect the
patterns of distribution.        No classification, in fact, seems appropriate
because there is so much overlapping of function.         Some of this is il-
lustrated by the accompanying chart.        These connectives are:        andâa, ka,
mais, na, ngbangati, si teneti, ti, tltene, tongana, and wala.             The re-
quirements of the decimal system of outlining forced na and mais, on the
one hand, and ngbangati and teneti, on the other hand, into single sections.
No harm is done because these pairs of connectives are semantically quite
similar.","[88, 89, 90, 91]"
"     The one example of a ti-verb phrase and a tx-noun phrase being joined
by na is A 34.    In this case, the noun is a noun of action, and therefore may
be considered to have a semantic affinity to verbs.      There are also cases
where na joins two ti-verb phrases (ex. 35-36).      Examples of na entering
into the construction of numeral phrases are 37-38.",[97]
"      7.22.     Many of the uses of a- are illustrated in the following brief
text (N79) which is the complete extemporaneous narration of a few in-
cidents in the life of an adolescent girl.                        The narrator is a Sango-French
bilingual who claimed to know neither the language of her father nor the
language of her mother.             She is one of those detribalized young people for
whom Sango is a native language.                 Each grammatical subject is enclosed in
[] brackets and all except pronominal ones are numbered for classification.
The numbered subjects are classified as follows:

"    For an inductive study of Sango grammar we were very well prepared.
The entire corpus consisted of about 3oo tape-recorded texts, which represent
about 4o hours of listening time, in addition to 250 letters written by
Centralafricans either to myself or to Radio Centrafrique.    The texts consist
of extemporaneous material (except for a few radio texts, which are either
prepared or extemporaneous translations from the French) covering many dif-
ferent subjects, by people of both sexes, covering a wide range of ages, and
representing the full gamut of ethnic groups in the Central African Republic.
The texts include things like the following?    interviews with people im-
mediately after an automobile accident, petty crime cases being tried in
court, interviews with patients in hospitals, interviews with people engaged
in different kinds of activities, fables, etc.    Transcribing these texts was
an enormous job} twenty-two hours of work for one hour of recording seemed to
be an average.",[15]

both.    They shall be distinguished by the terms ""lexically marked"" and ""non-
lexically marked.""       In either case, the subordinate clauses precede the major
clause.    Another class of sentences where the second clause rather than the
first may be considered as being in a subordinate position is discussed below.
The intonational features which mark the relationship between the clauses is,
as has been pointed out in 3.12, sometimes a rising tonal glide, sometimes a
level of pitch which never occurs at the end of a sentence (like what is
called in English a ""sustained pitch""), and almost always a slight pause.
All of these features are subsumed under and indicated by the comma.        15.21.12a.    Non-lexically marked subordinate clauses can generally be
identified by their lexical content.       They end with awe, or laâ (q.v. 8.13),
or contain hinga pepe 'don't know,' yi ti 'want to,' adu 'is,' or aeke nzoni
'it is good.'        The remaining ones can not be so identified, but it is pre-
cisely these which have the same meaning they would have if marked by tongana
(q.v. 5.81 and below).        Each of these different kinds of subordinate clauses
is now taken up in turn.","[249, 250]"
"     10.13. A noun phrase may consist of a noun with ti and a verb follow-
ing (ex. 1-2). There are also some phrases consisting of two nouns juxta-
posed in an appositive relation (ex. 3), and of two or more nouns joined in
an additive way by na (ex. 4). In a number of cases, the na phrase follow-
ing the noun is subordinate (ex. 5-6). This phenomenon is discussed under na
(q.v. 5.32.20). Since there may be phrases within phrases within phrases, and
since there may be several complements in a noun phrase, some noun phrases
are quite long (ex, 7-9).

"      A few observations about some sentences which pose problems in analysis
are appropriate.   Sentences 8, 11, and 37 might be described as consisting of
sequential clauses rather than of an initial subordinate clause followed by a
main clause.   In sentence 9 the construction nzoni laâ, si mbi eke ndo s6
does not seem to be in construction with anything else.       The construction
nzoni laâ 'it's good' can, of course, be followed by a clause (q.v. 15.21.12a),
but hardly, I should imagine, by one which contains the verb yi 'to want.'
The clause si mbi eke ndo sô is perhaps intercalated, but if nzoni laâ is
edited out and if si is taken to be sô (q.v. 15.21.12b), then it could be
in construction with the following clause:       i.e. 'Since you are here, I want
to....'   In any case there is a problem with si, for this is hardly the place
for the connective si.      Perhaps it is the French conjunction si 'if.'   Sentence
                                                                                 23827 seems to be poorly constructed:          the first clause does not seem to be in
construction with any other one? the second and third clauses may be con-
stituents of a single complex clause, but it is my opinion that the third one
is a correction or amplification of the second one.            Sentence 31 is classi-
fied as C,C but it is possible that the second clause is a type of correction
of the first, i.e. changing a Sango idiom for a French one.               Sentence 32 is
classified as a simple sentence, but it could also be looked upon as a con-
stituent of a complex sentence which includes the material in what is clas-
sified as sentence 31•    In sentence 61 there is no justification for two
occurrences of fadé which marks future time.            Since fadé occurs before the
subject of a verb, yi so was probably first intended to be the subject, but
at this point the sentence was restructured, necessitating the reintroduc-
tion of fadé.","[263, 264]"
"
 8.20. P r e - p o s e d        The pre-posed sentence particles are all borrowings from the French
 language unless one admits a few indigenous words which have been classified
 differently.         The French loan-words (ex. 1-4) are il faut (pronounced as fô,
 ifô or ilfô) 'it is necessary that....,' il ne faut pas 'it is necessary that
 ....not,' pourquoi (pronounced as pukwa or purkwa) 'why?' and est-ce que
 (pronounced as eski) 'is it true that....?'            The indigenous words which a
 different analysis might put here are fadé, which marks future time (q.v.
 9.10), and gbâ, which means something like 'nevertheless, necessarily.'
 (ex. 5).        The first has been described as a verbal adjunctive and the
 second, of which there is only one example, might be considered a connective.

9.10, Categories
    The verbs of Sango, like the other classes of words, are morphologically
quite simple.    Their only affix is a™ which marks the subject (q.v. 7.2o).
Otherwise, there is no inflection for any grammatical category whatsoever.
The suffixation of -ng6 (q.v. 6.3o) is verbal simply because verb stems ex-
clusively take this suffix, but the suffix is a nominalizing one and a verb
stem with -ng6 never functions as a predicate.        Categories of time and aspect
are accounted for lexically or contextually.        For example, completed action
is usually not marked in any explicit manner.        When there is need for pre-
cision, awe 'it is finished' (q.v. 9.3o) is introduced at the end of the
clause(s).    Future time is marked by fadé (q.v. 4.30) placed before the sub-
ject or by the verb eke 'to be' placed immediately before the main verb (dis-
cussed below).     The ""conditional mood"" is marked by tongana and ka (q.v.
5.81 and 5.20).     There is no passive.    For other semantic and grammatical
categories one must consult the dictionary.","[181, 182]"
"       As with ngbangati (q.v. 5.4o), this connective is pronounced in several
different ways.      The phonetic transcription of those which occurred in the
texts is given below, where the dropping of the parentheses will produce yet
another form.       In this grammar it is always given in the normalized form
tongana.                         toqga(na)       toqana
                         toqga(na)       toqana   tqna, tçne   tçç.
                         taqgana                  tçna         tç.(f)
                         doijgana        5.81.    As a conditional-temporal connective tongana is usually translated
'when, while, if,' etc.       This is not the only way of indicating these meaning
categories in the language.         Certain paratactic constructions have similar
meanings.       See 15. 21.12a.     ,   One of the errors of people whose native lan-
guages are French or English is to ignore these constructions and use tongana
for all of the similar conjunctions in their native languages.             Another error
is to put the tongana clause at the end of the sentence.              It occurs in this
position only in letters written by people who have been exposed to the Sango
of English-speaking missionaries.          See ex. 11-12.        tongana occurs with clauses marked for completed action (q.v. 9.3o) and
for continued action (q.v. 9.30), but there is no attested example of tongana
occurring in a clause marked for future time by fadê (q.v. 9.10).             Its position
in a clause is that immediately preceding the subject and therefore first in
the clause.       However, various pre-clausal elements (q.v. chp. 12) can precede
or follow tongana (ex. 7-10).

"6.20. Derivation     Derivation of nouns is achieved only by the suffixation of verbs with
-ngô.     More than the verb is nominalized:         the whole verb phrase, including
its complements, functions substantively.            (For discussion and illustration
see 6.30.)        Other non-nouns which are used as nouns are advisedly omitted
from the class of nouns.         It is best to talk of this or that word or

from other word classes which in a particular construction function as nouns
do.    The following kinds of words and constructions can function substantively
                 1.    Verbs.
                 2.    Adjunctives (with or without the adjunctive ni).
                  3.   ti phrases       What appears to be compounding in Sango is in reality abbreviated noun
phrases with the connective ti omitted.      Every such phrase, no matter what
its frequency may be, is equally acceptable with the connective.        These noun
phrases are those where one noun is semantically a modifier of the other.
One can properly assume that such noun phrases are predictable:        any much-
used phrase consisting of noun + ti + noun can probably occur also as noun +
noun.    This is true because similar constructions occur in the indigenous
languages of the area (e.g. Gbaya and Ngbandi).      Here follow a few examples:
                 lé ngû 'surface of the water'
                 ngu lé 'tears' (lit. 'water of eye')
                 da Nzapâ 'church' (lit. 'house of God')
                 kââ yângâ 'beard' (lit. 'hair of mouth')
                 mbé ngû 'other side of stream'

6.3o. -ng6        The suffix -ng6 is added to verb stems so as to make out of them (and
the whole phrase of which they are the head) substantives.        Like the English
gerund, these noun-like verbal constructions lack grammatical subjects but
can comprise objects,, [connective: peaces,,, lebd •other ; complements of time orè;.bi-

syllabic words likewise have all high tones, but verbs with final identical
vowels (e.g. bâa 'to see"") lose the final vowel with the suffixation (bângô
'seeing').     This description is true for some speakers, but for others it
must be said that mid tone occurs on the nominalized verb, including the
suffix.    Low tone, however, never seems to occur.      Likewise, polysyllabic
stems sometimes do not change or if they do, they change in different ways
(e.g. wâko 'to be soft' > wokôngô 'softness,' sukûla 'to wash' > sukûlângô
'washing').     A detailed study of these changes has not been made.     At any
rate, it seems advisable to choose one valid pattern regardless of the
various equivalent possibilities.","[153, 154, 155]"
"       As has been shown, the specific meaning of na is very elusive.         It
has been variously translated 'to,' 'for,' 'at,' 'toward,' 'in,' 'from,'
'of,' 'with,1 'and,' 'as,' 'on,' and in many other ways.          But it must not
be supposed that this extreme range leads to ambiguity in actual com-
munication.       In all but a very few cases, the context indicates quite
clearly what is meant.

serve as the complement of a noun, thus entering into a noun phrase, in a
way somewhat analogous to an attributive construction.         But the semantic
categories expressed are the same ones as are found in the instances pre-
viously discussed, where the na phrase is a complement of a verb.        That is,
the na phrase expresses location (ex. 1-2), time (ex. 3), possession (ex.
4), or end goal (ex. 5).      In a few cases, the na phrase seems to be absolute,
that is, in construction v/ith nothing else, as some sort of elliptical sen-
tence (ex. 3),       A na phrase may enter into or constitute pre-clause constructions
(q.v. chp. 12), where they are semantically nothing more than complements
of the verb placed before rather than after it.       Thus, pre-clausal na
phrases express location (ex. 6-7), time (ex. 8-9), means (ex. 10-11), sub-
ject (ex. 12), and so forth.      Among the time phrases, na ndâ nx and na pekd
n£ are frequently used (10/85 and 4o/85 occurrences respectively).        In a
number of instances, these phrases are reinforced by such adjunctives as
tongasô and fadesô.

is difficult to chart.     A few general remarks may be madë at this time.
     1„    The constituent occurring most frequently immediately after the
verb is the object, of whatever nature.      Examples in which an object im-
mediately follows a verb make up almost 4o per cent of the total number of
verb phrases.    Next in frequency of occurrence immediately after the verb
is the na phrase, which appears in this position in 19.5 per cent of the
examples in the corpus.
     2.    The greatest number of complements appearing in the verb phrase
is five.    Phrases comprising one or two complements are common, those with
three are fairly rare, those with four or five are extremely rare.
     3.    Each constituent may have its own internal constituents, according
to its own rules, which may be quite complex.      There is a general inverse
correlation between the complexity of individual constituents and the number
of constituents in the phrase, but it is not absolute.
     4.    The verb phrase introduced by tx comprises the same constituents
as that having a subject, but there are in general fewer of them.
     5.    It is very rare that any other complement in a verb phrase follows
a tx-verb phrase complement.
     6.    It is quite rare that any other complement follows one which is
itself a clause.","[202, 203]"
