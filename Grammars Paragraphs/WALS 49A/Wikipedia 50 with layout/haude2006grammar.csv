7      Clause and sentence structureIn this chapter, the most important aspects of simple and complex sentences in Movima are
described. Before going into details in the following sections, I want to point out some crucial
properties of Movima clause structure.
  First of all, Movima has a hierarchical alignment system. There is no case marking and no
agreement indicating grammatical relations. Word order is fixed, but it is semantically
determined: in a transitive clause, the participant higher in the animacy hierarchy is encoded
as the first core argument (ARG1) and the participant lower in the hierarchy is encoded as the
second core argument (ARG2). The semantic roles of the arguments are indicated by direct or
inverse voice marking on the verb, as described in 7.5. An effect of this system is an
ergativity split, since the alignment of grammatical relations and semantic roles is switched by
the voice markers (cf. 7.5.3).
  The fact that due to the hierarchical alignment system, grammatical relations are not
distinguished by case marking, agreement, or word order, makes it difficult to attach labels
such as “subject” and “object” to the syntactic positions. J. Judy (1965) uses these terms,
labelling the first argument in a transitive clause “subject” and the second argument “object”.
This, however, is a problem in inverse clauses, where, as Judy also points out, the second
argument encodes the agent.
  Moreover, it can be shown that if anything can be analysed as the subject in Movima, this is
not the first, but the second core argument, which represents the undergoer in a direct
transitive clause. This becomes apparent from the structure of relative clauses, described in
7.11. In addition, the second, but not the first core argument can be deleted in coordination,
which is also a criterion for subjecthood (cf. Keenan 1976). However, it may be misleading to
use the term “subject” for the second transitive argument, since it has some untypical
properties. In the direct construction, which can be seen as pragmatically less marked since it
indicates that the participant higher on the animacy hierarchy acts on the participant lower on
the hierarchy, the second argument encodes the undergoer. Also, this argument is not
obligatorily realized. To avoid confusion, I use the neutral terms ARGintr for the intransitive
argument, ARG1 for the first transitive argument, and ARG2 for the second transitive
argument. ARGintr and ARG2 are furthermore subsumed under the term “absolutive
argument”.
  Note, furthermore, that ARG1, the first argument in a transitive clause, is encoded in the
same way as the possessor (cf. 6.1).134
  This chapter is organized as follows. Sections 7.1–7.8 discuss constituent order, argument
encoding, and the assignment of semantic roles in affirmative main clauses. In Sections 7.9–
7.10, I describe affirmative main clauses with nonverbal predicates, as well as arguments that
contain a verb. In Section 7.11, relative clauses are described. Section 7.12 presents the main134
    The peculiarities of the Movima system outlined here may arise from the possibility that, at least historically,
all clauses are basically equational. Under this view, ARG1 represents a possessor, and the absolutive argument
represents the intransitive subject everywhere. This means that the proposition ‘I hit the dog’ would in Movima
be expressed as ‘my hitten one is the dog’. The term “subject” would be uncontroversial then. For an analysis of
other languages along these lines, see Sasse 1991.","[279, 280]"

1.11. Presentation of the data
The presentation of the Movima data as well as the English translation given deserve some
explanation.
  When a bivalent predicate in Movima is not combined with a cliticized referential element,
this automatically implies that the first argument is the first person singular. All bivalent
verbs, furthermore, have an implicit second argument, even though it is not obligatorily
overtly realized. Therefore, a simple bivalent verb without person marking is translated into
English as a full clause with a first person singular subject; the implied second argument is
always represented as “X”:(1)     sal-na    ‘I look for X.’Temporal categories are often not overtly indicated in Movima, but inferred from the context.
Hence, a clause unmarked for tense can imply any temporal category (past, present, future),
and example (1) can mean ‘I (have) looked for X,’ ‘I will look for X,’ etc. This is a problem
for the English translation, which I have solved as follows: examples where no context exists
(in particular, elicitation examples) are translated into the English simple present, even when
this does not sound like good English. Examples where a temporal context exists, even when
this cannot be seen in the example itself, are translated in a way which fits into this context
(e.g., ‘I looked for X’ in (1)). In many examples, the translation fits with the Movima data,
since tense is often reflected in the article.
  An area where Movima displays finer differentiations than English is spatial deixis: articles,
pronouns and demonstratives always indicate whether a referent is present, absent, in
existence or out of existence. Unless relevant for the discussion, I do not reflect these
categories in the English translation:(2)     a. i’nes kwe:ya            b. kinos     kwe:ya     c.        isnos     kwe:ya
           ART.f woman                ART.f.a woman                  ART.f.p woman
           ‘the/a woman (present)’    ‘the/a woman (absent)’         ‘the/a woman (deceased)’
           ‘the/a woman’               ‘the/a woman’                 ‘the/a woman’Occasionally, I use the indices i and j when it is necessary to indicate whether two are
coreferential or not:(3)     di’ joy-sicha’kwa=‘ne joy-che --i’ne, jankwa=sne
        HYP go-DES=f                  go-R/R--f        say=f.a
        ‘If she i wants to go, she i goes, shej said.’In the English translations, I use round brackets (as in (2)a and b) for relevant information
implicit in the Movima example. Contextual information, which cannot be inferred from the
example, is given in square brackets:(4)     sal-na      ‘I look for [her].’Many particles indicating tense, aspect, and mood (henceforth TAM) and discourse particles                                                                                             13
are hard to translate. For example, it is not clear how the particle rey in (5), which occurs in
almost every sentence, should be translated:(5)      bo        rey     ban-cho           os       ben‘i
         REAS      again bare-BR.inside ART.n.p grassland
         ‘Because the savannah was flat (you know/of course?).’             {EA, Cbba 164}Therefore, I often do not translate these particles.
  Square brackets with dots […] in the Movima example mean that a part of the text has been
omitted.
  It was necessary to employ special symbols representing different morphological processes.
Most are taken from the Leipzig Glossing Rules of 2003, like those given in (6).13 Others,
shown in (7), are specifically introduced for the purpose of the present description.(6)      ~       reduplication
         <>      infixation(7)      =       (internal) cliticization
         --      external cliticizationAs suggested by the Leipzig Glossing Rules, I sometimes use a colon ( : ) in the glosses when
it is not practical to segment the Movima word. For example, when a morphologically
complex noun is incorporated into a verb, this process can be represented more adequately
when the different morphemes of the noun are not set apart. In (8), an example is given of a
complex noun (cf. (8)a) that is incorporated into a verb (cf. (8)b). From the glosses in (8)b, it
can be seen that the noun consists of several morphemes. In (8)c, the morphemes are
separated; here, it is not directly clear from the representation whether the suffix - e modifies
the verb or, as is actually the case, belongs to the noun.(8)      a. kwa-n- e                          b. ban-kwan e         c. ban-kwa-n- e
            BR.mouth-LN-CO                       put-BR.mouth:LN:CO    put-BR.mouth-LN-CO
            ‘upper side, opening’                ‘to be put on top’    ‘to be put on top’The source of the examples is usually indicated. Between braces, the speaker code is given
(cf. Table 1), followed by either a word, an abbreviation, or a number. In text examples, the
speaker code is followed by words or by an abbreviation indicating the text, as shown (9)a.
Elicitation examples are marked by a number following the speaker code, as in (9)b.14
Examples from elicitation on demonstratives are marked by “DEM”, as in (9)c.","[35, 36, 37]"
"As can be seen, Movima only deviates in minor points from the typical Amazonian patterns
observed by Dixon and Aikhenvald, while the similarities are striking. In the following
paragraphs, I will point out some other features of Movima, not mentioned in connection with
the list above.
  Lexical tone, a feature found in a number of Amazonian languages, is not present in
Movima. Instead, there is contrastive vowel length. A consonant which deserves special
mention, since it does not seem to be common in the area, is the voiceless lateral fricative / /.
The syllable structure is simple: either CV or CVC.
  Morphological features which deserve special mention include the existence of an infix,
inserted according to metric criteria. Different types of reduplication are not only frequent, but
also serve a wide range of functions which are noteworthy from a cross-linguistic perspective.
These include, among other things, voice marking, the marking of inalienable possession, the
expression of predicative possession, and nominalization. Furthermore, Movima uses10
different cliticization processes to distinguish grammatical relations.
  The major parts of speech, distinguished by their morphological properties, are verbs,
nouns, and particles. Adjectives form a subclass of nouns. Referential elements (articles,
pronouns, demonstratives) constitute a category of their own, but display nounlike rather than
verblike properties. The class of particles is heterogeneous, the defining feature being that
particles are not productively combined with other morphemes. There are no ideophones.
  The fine-grained system of reference and deixis, expressed by referential elements (articles,
pronouns, demonstratives) is highly complicated, something which is not uncommon for
Amazonian languages. Gender, number, presence, absence, visibility, position, and motion
form the main parameters of deictic reference. The system also marks temporal categories on
nominal constituents, differentiating between actual or future existence and ceased existence
of the referent.
  Compounding and incorporation occur frequently. The different degrees of lexicalization of
words created by these processes make the morphological description of Movima difficult.
The morphological entities that can form part of a compound or can be incorporated into a
verb are nouns, noun roots, truncated nominal elements, and other bound elements with
lexical content. Many of these morphemes have a classificatory function, indicating shape and
consistency of an entity. All this is typical for Amazonian languages (cf. Payne 1990).
Demonstratives and other pronouns are not combined with nominal elements.
  Inalienable possession is an important criterion for the semantic classification of nouns.
Relational (inalienably possessed) nouns have to be overtly marked when denoting an
unpossessed or inalienably possessed entity; conversely, non-relational nouns are overtly
marked when denoting an inalienably possessed entity.
  A clause can have maximally two core arguments, depending on the valency of the verb.
The valency of a verb is generally overtly indicated by voice markers, which also specify the
semantic role(s) of the argument(s). The productivity and function of voice markers depend
on semantic properties of the base. Grammatical relations are distinguished by the way in
which the argument is cliticized to the base. It seems that Movima displays syntactic
ergativity, most clearly in relative clauses.
  As mentioned above, only the transitive argument higher on the animacy hierarchy is
obligatorily encoded. Strikingly, there is no obligatory marker for the first person singular, so
that this person is implicit on a bivalent predicate unmarked for person. This is untypical for
Amazonian languages (Dan Everett, p.c.). It has to do with the fact that, while all persons,
except the first, are encoded by enclitics, first and second person are (also) encoded by
optional bound pronouns preceding the predicate. The first person is not encoded by an
enclitic, but by the optional preverbal form only.
  There is no copula. Instead, in equational or possessive clauses, nouns function as
predicates. Morphological verbs can occur in NPs, their voice marker specifying the referent.
Serial verb constructions only exist to a very limited degree, and always involve verbs of
directed motion.","[33, 34]"
"
1.9. Structural characteristics of Movima
Movima has many characteristics typical of Amazonian languages. I will compare it to the
features listed as typically Amazonian in Dixon & Aikhenvald (1999: 8f.).(a)    polysynthetic, head-marking, agglutinating with little fusion
       Movima is agglutinating, i.e., most morphemes have only one meaning, and displays a
       limited degree of fusion. It is head-marking in that one transitive argument as well as8
      possession are marked on the predicate or possessed noun, respectively. It is
      problematic to classify the language as polysynthetic, however. Polysynthetic features
      of Movima are that a clause can consist of the predicate alone, and that there is
      productive noun incorporation. However, while voice/valency and applicative
      categories are encoded by verbal morphology, tense, location, and direction (typical
      features of polysynthesis in Amazonian languages, cf. Payne 1990: 214) are not
      morphologically expressed on the verb, and person only to a limited degree.
      Moreover, Movima is syntactically fairly configurational (verb-initial), a feature
      untypical of polysynthetic languages.(b)   / / in the vowel inventory, contrastive nasalization of vowels
      Neither the central unrounded vowel [ ], nor contrastive nasalization of vowels exist in
      Movima. The five vowel phonemes are i, e, a, o, u.(c)   Extensive classifier and/or semantically based gender systems
      Movima has a semantically-based gender system, marked on the referential elements
      (articles, pronouns, demonstratives). This system is independent of the classifier
      system, which seems to have arisen through compounding and incorporation.(d)   Only few oblique cases
      Indeed, there is only one oblique case in Movima, marked by the prefix n- on the
      referential elements (articles and pronominal forms). Otherwise, case marking is
      absent.(e)   Possession marked on the possessed noun, not on the possessor; most widespread
      word order is ‘possessor possessed’
      Possession is marked on the possessed noun. Since the possessed noun is marked by
      an enclitic encoding the possessor, however, the word order is ‘possessed possessor’.(f)   Just one core argument cross-referenced on the verb
      This is true for Movima: the only core argument that is obligatorily cross-referenced is
      the transitive argument encoding the participant higher on the animacy hierarchy.(g)   ‘Split-ergative’ systems arise due to complex rules determining which core argument
      is cross-referenced on the verb
      A split-ergative pattern can indeed be observed in Movima, arising from the
      hierarchical alignment system: the transitive argument lower on the animacy hierarchy
      (in subordinate and negative clause, the argument higher on the hierarchy) is encoded
      like the intransitive argument, regardless of whether it is A or O.(h)   The bound pronominal forms marking a possessor within an NP are the same as one
      of the bound pronominal paradigms for marking core arguments of a clause
      This is indeed the case. The possessor is encoded in the same way as the first
      argument of a transitive clause, which is the only argument obligatorily encoded.","[31, 32]"
"9.2.5. Incorporated elements denoting an instrument
Occasionally, incorporated modifiers are found denoting an entity which is involved in the
event, but which is neither a part of the undergoer nor the Ground with respect to which the
event takes place. Since it denotes an entity that is involved, but not affected by the event, it
can be labelled “instrument”. As is the case with incorporated elements denoting the Ground
(cf. 9.2.4), the verb receives the applicative marker -e . The following examples illustrate this:
384
(66)    jayna nis-na=is                is       bari=is di’ jayna pay’-but-e

        twist-BR.water here ART.pl clothes spread-DR--pl.a DSC
        ‘My clothes were wrung out like this, I spread them (on the line).’{EA, Tomina’ 094}9.2.6. Classificatory incorporation
Often, modifying incorporation involves the incorporation of a classificatory bound nominal
element (cf. 5.3.2, 5.3.4) that indicates a physical shape in which an action is carried out or
the shape of the product in which the action results. This process can have a similar function
as depictive predicates in languages like English. The incorporated bound root ew ‘BR.tail’
in the verb damoy ewna ‘braid’ in (70), for example, indicates that hair is twisted in a such a
way that it resembles a tail. And the incorporated bound root ba ‘BR.round’ in (71) indicates
that the action of chewing results in a round object.(70)    damoy- ew-na--as            kabo di’ sum-na is                risa-<kwa~>kwa=i       ney
        twist-BR.tail-DR--n.a or           HYP tie-DR ART.pl BR.hair<INAL~>ABS=pl here
        ‘I braid it [lit: “I tail-twist it”] or I tie their hair like this.’    {EA, Nietos 005}(71)    dan-a-ba=as              os          rey do’we
        chew-DR-BR.round=n.a ART.n.p again clothes
        ‘It [the cow] chewed my dress into a ball.’                           {EA, Cbba 089}This type of modifying incorporation resembles argument incorporation. The incorporated
elements are usually the same as those that can be incorporated as arguments, and in argument
incorporation, the type of undergoer is characterized inside the verb. However, like the other
types of modifying incorporation, the process discussed here creates verbs that are subject to
voice alternations.
  Moreover, in difference to argument incorporation, the clause can usually not contain a
coreferential noun phrase, since the meaning of the incorporated element is often                                                                                               385
metaphorically extended. For example, it would not be possible to replace the incorporated
element - ew in (70) by the noun e~ ew-kwa ‘tail’ (RED~BR.tail-ABS), since the undergoer
of the event is not a tail, but hair. Likewise, the verb danaba ‘chew into a ball’ in (71) does
not refer to an action affecting a round object, but to an action that results in a round object.
  Argument incorporation is different in this respect, even though it can also have
classificatory features. In (72), the incorporated element classifies the patient as a round-
shaped object, whose identity is specified by an external NP.(72)    jiram-poj-kay-a=‘ne         toje os        ek-a-ba-wa=‘ne
        pretty-CAU-INV-LV=f very ART.n.p kick-DR-BR.round-NMZ=f

        obl-ART.n.p ball
        ‘She liked the kicking of the ball a lot.’                {EA, Basket 003}Examples (73) and (74) illustrate more cases of classificatory incorporation involving the
incorporated element -ba. Here, it also seems to be the case that the result of the action is a
round-shaped object, similar to (71) above.(73)    che jay e jayna it-a-ba=n                          kos     ve’e
        and then     DSC gather-DR-BR.round=2              ART.n.a fire
        ‘And then you rake the fire.’                                       {LY chivé 008}(74)    ban-na=is      os        bujdi n-os              teres-cho,
        put-DR=pl.a ART.n.p thread obl-ART.n.p middle-BR.inside
        puy-a-ba=is--kas
        hem-DR-BR.round=pl.a--n.a.OBV
        ‘They put the thread in the middle, they rolled it.’ [when making candles]
        {GB, Ganado 009}Example (75) is interesting in that it oscillates between classificatory incorporation and the
incorporation of a Ground-denoting element (cf. 9.2.4). On the one hand, the incorporated
element denotes the Ground with respect to which the action is carried out (‘to sit on an
animal’). This is also signalled by the applicative suffix -e (cf. 9.8.3). On the other hand, the
incorporated element does not denote the undergoer, but rather specifies the way in which the
action is carried out (‘as if sitting down on an animal’). Therefore, this is also a case of
classificatory incorporation.(75)    as-poy-e: -e                   n-is         kori:di
        sit-BR.animal-APPL-AGT obl-ART.pl stick
        ‘We sat on the sticks [i.e., our hobbyhorses].’             {EA, Dichiyeye 013}As this example shows, the different types of modifying incorporation are not always easy to
keep apart. Furthermore, not only between the types of modifying incorporation, but also
between argument incorporation and classificatory incorporation, there seem to be quite a few
borderline cases. The fact that classificatory bound elements can not only represent386
incorporated arguments, but are also productively used as modifiers, may be responsible for
the apparent lability or irregular valency properties of some incorporating verbs described in
9.1.3 above (in particular, (34)–(36)). It is possible that these cases represent a transition from
valency-reducing argument incorporation towards valency-retaining classificatory
incorporation, of the kind described by Mithun (1984).","[407, 408, 409, 410]"

Acknowledgements
Many people have helped me get this work done. First and foremost, my gratitude goes to
Pieter Muysken, who has made this project possible by hosting it within his Spinoza
programme “Lexicon and Syntax” at the Radboud University Nijmegen. Not only did I
benefit from his insightful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript, which were always
to the point and opened new lines of thought for me. He also gave me the feeling that
whatever problem there would be on the way, he would try to help out. Whenever I
approached him for linguistic or non-linguistic advice, I got an open ear, no matter whether it
was the right moment or not. His confidence in this project and his constant encouragement
were an enormous support.
   I was also very lucky in that during the entire project, I had Rik van Gijn as my office mate.
This meant lots of fun, discussions, and the possibility to exchange experiences on life in the
linguistic world. My work has benefited greatly from Rik’s insights and from his talent to
present things systematically.
   Hein van der Voort, occasional office mate, advised me in many ways. In particular, I am
very grateful for his extremely detailed, critical and helpful comments on the entire
manuscript.
   I owe many thanks to Mily Crevels, who has helped me a lot especially at the beginning of
this project. In particular, Mily accompanied me to Santa Ana in 2001, and through her I got
acquainted with the people who became my closest friends there. With respect to field work
and dealing with practical matters in the Beni, Mily gave me the most valuable advice.
   Outside the Spinoza group, I want to thank the following linguists for commenting on
earlier drafts of specific chapters of this book, for discussing the data with me, and/or for
advising me on particular topics: Willem Adelaar, Martin Böhler, Werner Drossard, Dan
Everett, Mats Exter, Ad Foolen, Colette Grinevald, Carlos Gussenhoven, Birgit Hellwig,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, Helen de Hoop, Haike Jacobs, Leonid Kulikov, Geraldine Legendre,
Andrej Malchukov, Maarten Mous, Doris Payne, Hans-Jürgen Sasse, René Schiering, Anna
Siewierska, Leon Stassen, and Fernando Zúñiga. I am especially grateful to Werner Drossard,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, and Hans-Jürgen Sasse for the long and inspiring discussions on the
Movima voice and valency system, whose essence I would probably never have understood
otherwise. My particular gratitude also goes to Willem Adelaar and Carlos Gussenhoven for
discussing earlier versions of the phonology chapter with me, and for their patience in
answering my numerous questions on the topic. In addition, I am deeply indebted to Willem
Adelaar for his valuable comments on the entire manuscript. And Maarten Mous is especially
thanked for sitting with me for hours when I was desperate and did not know how this work
could ever come to an end.
   Pilar Valenzuela is acknowledged for pointing out Movima to me as a possible language of
research.
   I furthermore want to thank the participants of the Americanist Colloquium in Nijmegen for
their comments on my talks, in particular Jürgen Bohnemeyer, Swintha Danielsen, Martina
Faller, Rafael Fischer, Jesus Mario Girón, Katja Hanss, Roland Hemmauer, Sergio Meira,
Loretta O’Connor, and Frank Seifart. And without the critical questions from the participants
of my “Strukturkurs Movima” at the Linguistics Department in Cologne, some problems and
contradictions in my analyses would hardly ever have become apparent to me.                                                                                                i
   While it was not possible to integrate into the present work all the comments I got, they
highly increased my insight into the Movima grammar.
   My research has also benefited greatly from the open and friendly atmosphere at the
Linguistics Department of the Radboud University in Nijmegen. My thanks go particularly to
Helen de Hoop, Monique Lamers, Peter de Swart, Andrej Malchukov, Joost Zwarts, Wilske
Driessen, Janine van der Zijl, Else Havik, Margot van den Berg, and Marleen van de Vate.
   It is hard to express my gratitude adequately to the Movima speakers who contributed the
data on which this grammar is based. Their hospitality and their willingness to teach me their
language were overwhelming.
   First of all, I want to thank Esaltación Amblo Ovales, who took upon herself the task of
teaching me Movima. She is the best teacher I could have imagined, with her clarity of
pronunciation, her great memory, and her readiness to talk to me in Movima about all kinds of
topics. I am also grateful to her sister Etelvina and her cousin Modesta for receiving me in
their house with so much friendliness.
   My thanks go furthermore to Julia Malale Humasa, my principal teacher during my first and
my last stay. Good-humoured and funny, yet serious when it came to analysing her language,
she is a delightful instructor.
   I owe many thanks to Eligardo Chirimani Malue for working with me every day right from
the beginning. Without his linguistic insight and his careful judgment, it would never have
been possible to create such a large and useful text database. Apart from that, it is mainly due
to the fact that he and Melvin Rossel Yoqui took so much interest in maintaining their native
language that this research was carried out at all. The other members of the Subcentral
Indígena Movima are also acknowledged for supporting this project throughout.
   I am furthermore grateful to Griselda Cáumol, Balvina Almaquio, Herlan Rojas, Ela Rossel,
Nelly Gualusna, Peregrina Cayú, Dora Vargas, Delmira Masaro, Nataniel Cáumol, Eleuterio
Mole, Alejandro Yónima, Juan Hualima, Bernarda Gualusna, María Esaltación Sepi, and Luis
Yalauma for teaching me their language.
   Most of my teachers I would never have met without the help of Janeth Cayalo. She took
me with her on her motorbike every day during the beginning of my field work to find
consultants. I am deeply grateful to her.
   This leads me to other friends in Santa Ana without whom my stays there would have been
much less effective and pleasant. Elsita Asbún, Esperanza Cayalo, Sonia Rivero, and Graciela
Rodríguez helped me in all aspects of daily life and became dear friends. Olga Arteaga and
her family provided a home for me for most the time, and their parrot was my most faithful
companion and probably the only one who learned words from me. I am also indebted to
Milton Villavicencio and his wife Loida for their great hospitality.
   Outside Santa Ana, I especially want to thank Dr. Carlos Patiño Kühn in Santa Cruz for
taking my health worries off my back. Gudrun Birk is thanked for digging with me in the
APCOB library.
   Last but not least, I want to thank my parents for their strong support at all times. My
friends in Cologne took up with my unusual lifestyle with much understanding. And my
deepest gratitude is with Harald Stoffels, who accompanied me towards and throughout this
entire project, and who is the main responsible for the fact that the years of thesis writing
were very happy years.

        ‘Is the spoon there?’ – ‘It’s here.’                      {EA, DEM 089}A referent that cannot be seen, but otherwise perceived (cf. 4.9.2.4), can also be referred to by
an absential demonstrative. This indicates usually that the sound (or smell, sensation) is not
perceived anymore. Consider the following example:(235)   koro’        o’o:wa no-kos          toje -wa
        DM.a.n       audible obl-ART.n.p pass.AGT-NMZ
        ‘I heard it when I just walked by.’                             {EA, DEM 199}The same is the case when an object moving in the air is concerned. This kind of object is also
referred to by a distal form of Set 3 when the speaker is looking at it. In contrast, when the
object is already out of sight, the absential demonstrative is used, as in (236).(236)   koro’     toje: e     kos       kara’a
        DM.a.n pass.AGT ART.n.a red_macaw
        ‘The red macaw is flying by.’ [we don’t see it anymore]         {EA, DEM 068}When the situation is not continuing during the moment of speech or when the speaker does
not know if it is continuing or not, the past demonstrative is used. So, for example, the
consultant’s comment to (237) was that the object was definitely gone:(237)   oso’o          dewaj-na ban-sasa:-ne
        DM.p.n 1 see-DR              put-TRC.table-APPL
        ‘I saw it on the table.’ [but it is not there any more]         {ER, DEM 400}In the case of (238), in contrast, the speaker stated that the object was probably still hanging
at the same place, but that she had forgotten where she had hung it up.(238)   oso’      do’-cho
        DM.p.n put_on-BR.inside

The following sentence illustrates the temporal distinction between the absential and the past
demonstrative.(239)       [...] di’ joy kiro’         ite’ni kabo di’ joy        iso’        kayni

4.10.          Congruence in semantic and pragmatic categories
All referential elements with the same referent have to be congruent in the semantic and
pragmatic features they express. With respect to gender and number, this is straightforward,
since all types of referential elements make the same distinctions in these categories.
However, the pragmatic categories are not represented equally in the different types of
referential elements. The personal pronouns only differentiate between two categories,
presence and absence. The article, in addition to these categories, can furthermore encode
ceased existence of the referent. The demonstratives, finally, distinguish presence, absence
and ceased existence according to different criteria than both the article and the pronouns,
probably because they do not only refer to an entity, but also to the motion or position event
in which the entity is involved.
  If the clause contains a demonstrative, the other referential elements agree with it. That is to
say, their selection follows the criteria for the use of the demonstratives. The following
examples may serve as an illustration:(240)       koro’      no-kode:       kos                    yana:we,       jankwa=us

            ‘There [i.e., in Santa Ana] was an old woman in tipoy who was, good grief!, eating

even though it is not far away. The absential article is probably used in agreement with the
demonstrative. The speaker in (241) suggests what I might be telling people when I would be
back home; she did not imply that the old woman would be dead at that occasion. Thus, the
article, like the demonstrative, temporally locates the situation, not the existence of the person
referred to.
  The personal pronouns, which do not encode the category of past existence, apply the91

1.4. The situation of the language
It is conspiuous that despite the early loss of native indigenous culture, the Movima language
has been preserved until today. This can, in part, be attributed to the fact that the Jesuits
recognized the native languages and stimulated their use (cf. Crevels 2002: 13).8 However,
Movima has been maintained for at least two generations longer than many of its
neighbouring languages which were also spoken in Jesuit missions, such as the now possibly
extinct languages Canichana and Cayuvava.
   This may have to do with the fact that Movima speakers are proud of their language. This
is, for example, reflected in their awareness of linguistic purity. I have never observed code-
switching in a conversation between native speakers. When I was involved in a conversation,
some passages were explicitly translated into Spanish for me. Mixing of Spanish and Movima
is disliked. Many people who do not have a full command of Movima prefer not to speak it.
   While there are many Spanish loans in Movima, this is predominantly the case for nouns
denoting cultural items introduced by the Europeans. In at least one case, however, a Movima
noun has been replaced by the corresponding Spanish term because of its derogatory
connotation in Spanish. This is the Movima noun ku:lo ‘top’: since it is homophonous with
the familiar Spanish word ‘backside’, it has been replaced by the loan ari:wa, from Spanish
arriba ‘on top’ (Chirimani, p.c.).
   Despite the long preservation of the language, Movima is seriously endangered today (cf.
Crevels 2002: 21): there are no more children learning the language, and most fluent speakers
are over fifty years olds. This sudden change, despite the maintenance of the language
throughout the process of acculturation and the contact with white people for 300 years, is6
  This is a general phenomenon found in the Moxos region (cf. Crevels 2002: 21f.)

  However, I use the term “Movima” here for the ethnic group only.

  However, there are no written materials from the Jesuit times (cf. Montaño Aragón 1987: 241).",[27]

1.10. The organization of this book
The organization of this book is as follows. Chapter 2 describes the phonological and
morphophonological properties of the language. In the section on intonation, the difference
between declarative and interrogative sentences is explained.
  In the first part of Chapter 3, the different morphological units and processes are introduced,
including the different kinds of cliticization by which the grammatical relations are
distinguished. The second part of this chapter provides an overview of the parts of speech in
Movima, paying special attention to the status of adjectives.
  The morphological, semantic, and pragmatic properties of the different types of referential
elements, which play a central role in the grammar of Movima, are described in Ch. 4.
  Chapters 5 and 6 deal with noun morphology. In Ch. 5, independent nouns, compounds, and
the different kinds of bound nominal elements (bound roots etc., including classificatory
elements) are described. Since possession is central for the semantic classification of nouns
and their morphological properties, this phenomenon is described separately in Ch. 6.
  Chapter 7 deals with Movima syntax. Here, clause structure and argument encoding are
described, the hierarchical alignment system is explained, and different sentence types are
presented. The syntactic effect of argument incorporation, whose morphological
characteristics are presented in Ch. 9, is also illustrated in this chapter. Chapter 7 furthermore
includes a description of the different types of subordination. In this way, negation, which is
expressed differently for main and subordinate clauses, can be described in one single section.
Coordination, which involves the combination of two main clauses, is described in Ch. 12,
which deals with the different types of coordinating particles.
  The three following chapters, 8, 9, and 10, are dedicated to verb morphology. In Ch. 8, the
intriguing system of voice and valency marking is described. Since this system interacts
closely with semantic and lexical properties of the verbal bases, the different types of verb
roots and bases are described in this chapter as well.
  Chapter 9 gives a more detailed account of complex verbal bases, which contain
morphological elements that interact with the valency of the verb. In the first part of this
chapter, the different types of noun incorporation are described: argument incorporation,
which leads to a decrease in valency, and modifier incorporation, which occurs prior to
valency assignment. The second part describes the causative, benefactive, and applicative
morphemes.
  Chapter 10 deals with other verbal morphemes, which have a modal and/or an aspectual
function. Formally, they have in common that they do not interact with verbal valency, even
though their function and productivity can be influenced by the valency properties of the base.
  In Chapter 11, nominalizing and verbalizing morphemes are presented. Some of these are
also described, where relevant, in earlier chapters, (e.g., in Ch. 3 on the noun/verb distinction,
in Ch. 7 on subordination). Since nominalization and verbalization often interact, both
processes are described together in this chapter.
  Chapter 12 gives an overview of the large class of particles. These inlude clause-
coordinating particles, TAM particles, and discourse particles.","[34, 35]"

        ‘Did the two of you come?’                                    {EA, La ciega 005}The reason why the enclitics can occur alone, whereas the proclitics can only occur in
combination with the enclitics, is probably that the proclitics are identical for singular and
plural. The enclitics, in contrast, indicate both person and number.
   Nevertheless, the absolutive proclitics, even though they are not obligatory, occur much
more frequently in texts than the ARG1 proclitics. This is especially striking with regard to the
first person singular. In contrast to the first person singular ARG1 proclitic, the absolutive
proclitic occurs in nearly all text examples. This is probably because the first person singular
is implicit as ARG1, but not when it is the absolutive argument. The following examples
illustrate the difference.(66)    first person singular absolutive

        ‘Then I hid the harmonica, I put (it) away again.’                  {EA, Organ 015}When the context is clear, the absolutive first person singular proclitic can be omitted. This,
however, is less common than with the other absolutive proclitics. Usually, it happens only
when the absolute argument is encoded by the free pronoun (cf. below). In the following
example, the first person is first encoded by the proclitic and then only by the free pronoun:(68)    jayna, do:koy, jankwa=us, jayna n               jo’yaj,    loy in a      joy-che

       ‘Then he said, “okay, now (that) I have arrived, I’ll go.”‘          {EA, Cbba 185}This leads us to the representation of SAPs by a free pronoun. As is the case with non-SAPs
(cf. 7.3), a free pronoun representing ARGintr can occur either instead of or in addition to the
bound pronoun. The following examples of intransitive clauses show the occurrence of the
free pronoun, either before or after the predicate, instead of the proclitic:(69)    jayna     bele:k-a         in a

This shows that the free pronouns have a different status than the proclitics, which have to
cooccur with the enclitic (cf. (62) and (63) above):(72)    jo<ya:~>y-a’,    iy’ i      ja’a, iy’ i       ja’    joy-che
        go<RED~>-IRR PRO.1pl just PRO.1pl just               go-R/R
        ‘Nobody went [there], just us, just we went.’              {EA, Cabildo 004}In (73), the free pronoun representing the absolutive argument occurs in addition to the
enclitic bound pronoun:(73)    iy’ i       an net-a-wa:ka--y’ i
        PRO.1pl EV drive_cattle-DR-cow--1pl
        ‘We drove cattle.’                                            {EA, Dichiyeye 005}A free pronoun can also cooccur with a proclitic. In (74), the free pronoun occurs after the
predicate. In (75), it occurs in topic position. Example (75) also displays the occurrence of the
free instead of bound pronoun, as was described above.(74)    ban rey       in     tino:k-a     in a

        ‘I (was) the woman and I (was) the man.’ [i.e., doing both women’s and men’s work]
        {BA, TX 119}Thus, as is the case with non-SAPs, a free pronoun representing the absolutive argument can
occur either in addition to, or instead of, the enclitic pronoun.
  The following examples show the representation of ARG1 by a free pronoun. In contrast to
non-SAPs, where this is a rare phenomenon (cf. (23) and (24) above), this occurs quite
regularly with SAPs. This can perhaps be explained by the fact that firstly, SAPs are not
encoded as ARG2 of a transitive clause, so that no confusion with the other grammatical
relation is possible, and that secondly, SAPs are referentially unambiguous. In (76) and (77),
the free pronoun occurs after the predicate, and in (78), it occurs in topic position:274

accompanied by the focus particle kaw, which causes an original ARG1 to be encoded as
ARGintr (cf. 7.8). This is the same as with a third person ARG1 (cf. 7.3.2, example (33)).
Consider (79):(79)     nokowa    jayna       in a      kwey pul-na

         ‘From now on, I will be the one who sweeps.’                       {EA, Antes de fiesta 025}As a final point, as was mentioned at the beginning of this section, a bound pronoun encoding
a SAP cannot represent ARG2. This will be discussed in the following section (cf. 7.5).
However, elicitation shows that a clause-initial free pronoun can represent a SAP as ARG2.
The following is an example of this:(80)     in a      nokowa      joy-a- e=n,   kas joy-a- e-wa=n          kos

7.5. The hierarchical alignment system
In the previous sections, the encoding and differentiation of the arguments was described. The
differentiation of the arguments through cliticization is, however, not case marking, since the
formal differences in argument encoding do not reflect the semantic roles of the arguments.
Rather, Movima displays hierarchical alignment: the distinction between the transitive
arguments, ARG1 and ARG2, is determined by their position on the animacy hierarchy.153 The
semantic roles of the arguments are indicated by direct or inverse voice marking on the
predicate.","[295, 296, 297, 298]"
"In contrast, most quantifiers, including the four native number terms shown in (191), belong
to the class of verblike adjectives:53(191)    sota’-ra       ‘one’
         oy-ra          ‘two’
         tas-ra         ‘three’
         oyka:-ra       ‘four’
3.10.4.2. Syntactic characteristics of adjectives
The most common syntactic function of adjectives is that of predication, as in (192).
However, an adjective can also occur as the head of an NP, as in (193). An NP containing an
adjective refers to the entity to which the property is ascribed, not to the property as an
abstract concept.54(192)    pa:luy is         bari=sne
         cold    ART.pl foot=f.a
         ‘Her feet were cold.’                                                    {EA, Muriendo 005}(193)    kilno’o=s         tochi’i

nominal element (cf. 5.2), or as the predicate in a relative clause. The roots of the group in
(188) always occur in a compound (except tun- ‘black’ and bew- ‘ripe’, which are combined
with the verbalizing suffix -ni in the absence of a bound nominal element): they are
obligatorily combined with a noun or bound nominal element. This is illustrated in (194) for
the root kaw- ‘much’:(194)    kaw-tino:na’        ‘many years’
         kaw-yemes           ‘many days’
         kaw-mo              ‘many birds’53
   The numbers ‘one’ and ‘four’ are probably morphologically complex: sot-a’-ra (other-IRR-BE.ntr) ‘no other
(thing)’ i.e. ‘one’, and oy-ka:-ra (two-MLT-BE.ntr) ‘several times two (things)’, i.e. ‘four’. However, I regard
these words as lexicalized, especially since the multiple-event marker -ka (cf. 3.6.1 and 10.3) normally indicates
several instances of an event, not just two.
54
   The abstract property can be denoted when the adjective receives the abstract nominalizing suffix -wa:nas (cf.
11.1.6.)114
        kaw-poy         ‘many animals’
        kaw-mi          ‘much water’The adjectives in (187) can also be combined with a noun or bound nominal elements, like
nouns in compounding:(195)   bijaw-kwe:ya      ‘old woman’
        veynte-ye:mes     ‘twenty days’
        tochi’-to:da      ‘small piece’

        obl-ART.n foot=f
        ‘Probably she has a small piece of a bottle in her foot.’ {EA, Summary 024}That they participate in compounding makes adjectives similar to nouns. However, there is a
major difference with nouns: in a compound, the adjective (or adjectival root) is always the
first and the noun (or bound nominal element) is always the second element. The adjective,
therefore, is clearly the modifier of a head noun.
   When a noun phrase is modified by a relative clause, the relative clause can contain either
the adjective, as in (199), or the head noun, as in (200). The difference between these
constructions is discussed in 7.11.(199)   yey-na is         to:mi   [di’ pa:luy]
        want-DR ART.pl water      REL cold

        ART.pl cold      REL      water
        ‘cold water’Thus, in general, an adjective modifies a noun either by forming a compound with that noun                                                                                          115
or by means of a relative clause. However, there seem to be examples of simple juxtaposition,
too. These usually involve the adjective mere’ ‘big’ or tochi’ ‘small’.
  There are three pieces of evidence for the possible juxtaposition of these adjectives with a
noun. First of all, in (201), there is phonological evidence against compounding: there is a
short pause between the adjective and the adjacent noun, and even the release vowel of the
adjective is audible. This may be a case of juxtaposition:55(201)     kire’      jeyto:va is        am-me=is               juyeni,

usually not occur in compounds in that form. For example, the reduplicated noun lu’~lu’
‘rain’ is usually not found in a compound; normally, only its root, lu’, is combined with
another base, as shown in (202)a. However, in combination with mere’, it always occurs in its
full form, as shown by (202)b:(202)     a. din-lu’                              b. mere’ lu’~lu’
             hard-BR.rain                            big       RED~BR.rain
             ‘strong rain’                           ‘a lot of rain’The strongest argument that mere’ and tochi’ can appear in simple juxtaposition with the noun
they modify comes from the fact that they are often found behind the noun, without being
connected to it through the relativizer:(203)     kas rey          tikoy-na:-wa--as,           os      si:wa mere’e

          ‘Then he bought a bit of meat.’                 {EA, Visita 095}A final feature which points to a different status of these two adjectives as opposed to the
others is their function as adverbs: tochi’ and mere’ can not only modify nouns, but also other
adjectives, as in (205), and verbs, as in (206):(205)     tochi’ bey-ra            ja’ is          lok-a- e=is

          ‘Just a little bit [of fruits] did they shake down.’ {EA, Dichiyeye 059}55
  Still, that these adjectives easily participate in compounding was illustrated in (198), where tochi’ is combined
with a bound root (toda ‘BR.piece’), which cannot occur independently.","[137, 138, 139]"

(i)    Most languages have prefixes, and there are fewer prefix than suffix positions
       There is only one “real” prefix in Movima, the oblique case marker n-. Other prefixes
       are reduplicated elements. Otherwise, Movima is mainly suffixing.(j)    (On typical order of prefixes)
       Does not apply: only one prefix (n- or a reduplicated element) can occur at a time.(k)    Most verbal categories (e.g. tense, aspect, modality, direction) are expressed through
       optional suffixes
       All these categories are expressed not by suffixes, but by optional particles in
       Movima, whose distribution in the clause is relatively free. Tense is, in addition, a
       nominal category, expressed by referential elements.(l)    Subordinate clauses typically involve nominalized verbs, the type of subordination
       being marked on the verb
       Indeed, subordination (as well as main-clause negation) always involves
       nominalization of the predicate. The type of subordination, however, is either not
       overtly indicated, or indicated by a particle preceding the subordinate clause.(m)    If there is noun incorporation, typically only those nouns which are obligatorily
       possessed can be incorporated, and they typically precede the verb root
       There are different types of productive noun incorporation, involving unpossessed
       nouns or body-part-terms. Apart form body-part terms, obligatorily possessed nouns
       cannot be incorporated. The incorporated nominal element follows the root.(n)    In many languages adverbs and adpositions may be incorporated into the verb
       This does not seem to be the case in Movima.(o)    There is generally only a small class of lexical numbers
       Indeed, there are only four number terms, from 1 to 4, and the terms for 1 and 4 seem
       to be morphologically complex (“no other” and “several times two,” respectively).","[32, 33]"

the concept or entity denoted by the content word of the noun phrase. The content word can
be a noun or a verb (cf. 7.10). Example (20) shows a noun phrase (underlined) containing a

In (22), the direct bivalent voice marker -na on the verb indicates that the entity referred to by
the article is the undergoer of a two-participant event. A more detailed account of this
phenomenon is found in 7.10 and 8.2.
  The content word in a noun phrase can be modified by a relative clause (cf. 7.11):                                                                                              139

syntactic proclitics to the predicate or noun they modify (cf. 4.1), the article is a syntactic
proclitic to the content word with which it forms a noun phrase. Between the article and this
word, only particles can occur (cf. Ch. 12), as illustrated by (24) and (25):(24)    is       nu:<na~>n-a=is              chon wa:ka di’ tikoy-na=us

        ‘And where will the ranch be then?’                    {GB, Ganado 049}Some forms of the article are similar, or even identical, to the absential bound pronouns (cf.
Table 9 above). However, there is an important phonological difference: the final /s/ of the
article is often realized as [h] (cf. 2.6):(26)    as pa:ko       [as pa:k ] ~ [ah 'pa:k ]        ‘the/a dog’    (ART.n dog)On bound pronouns, in contrast, this aspiration never occurs. Compare the pronunciation of
the article as in (27)a with that of the homophonous bound pronoun as in (27)b:(27)    a.    am-na=as         pa:ko        b.     am-na=as

             ‘The/a dog bites X.’                 ‘It bites X.’The choice of the two variants of the article is speaker-dependent: some speakers consistently
use the aspirated variant, others use most of the time the variant with the final [s], and many
use both variants interchangeably. With speakers who always use the aspirated variant, the
[s]-final variant appears when the following word begins with a sibilant (/t / or /s/):(28)    is china a [ is t i'na a]                ‘(the) manioc’      (ART.pl manioc)It seems that older speakers mainly use the [s]-final forms. The [s]-final forms as given in
Table 11 above are the ones used by Judy & Judy (1967) and were also chosen by the
speakers as the standard spelling. They can be seen as underlying, firstly because a final /h/ is140
never realized as [s], and secondly because the aspiration seems to be a common phenomenon
in the local variety of Spanish as well. However, it is important to keep in mind that the
possibility of aspiration is a phonological criterion for distinguishing articles from bound
pronouns.
  I will now turn to the internal morphological structure of the article. All article forms can be
analysed as composed of a syllabic element which specifies semantic and pragmatic features
of the referent, and the final element s, which has the function of introducing a noun phrase.
This analysis is supported by the fact that both elements can occur separately and in
combination with other morphemes. The final element s can be cliticized to a proximate or
positional demonstrative (cf. 4.3 and 4.9.1 below). In this way, the demonstrative acquires a
determiner function. Example (29) illustrates the determining function of a speaker-oriented
proximate demonstrative:(29)      ayru=s             as-wa:nas neyru, kas yey-a-waj-wa
          DM.spk.n=DET sit-ABSTR here         NEG want-DR-BE.place-NMZ
          ‘This house here, I don’t like it.’                       {EA, Mi casa 003}Examples (30)–(31) show positional demonstratives as determining referential elements:(30)      dol-ra      kode:=s          ro:ya n-is           mo’incho:-bun
          full-BE.ntr DM.nst.n=DET house obl-ART.pl chivé-BR.mass

          ‘... because that woman doesn’t like me at all.’            {EA, Asilo 090}Example (32) shows that the demonstrative is an element of the noun phrase, since it encodes
the possessor and is attached to the possessed noun by internal cliticization (cf. 3.9.1):(32)      u’ko       ulcha -a=kine’e=s            kwe:ya63
          PRO.m in_law-LV=DM.f.std=DET woman
          ‘He is the son-in-law of that (standing) woman.’ {EA, Neighbours 011}The absential and the past demonstratives (cf. 4.9.3) do not occur as determiners. They can
only function as pronouns or as predicates (cf. 7.3.3 and 7.9.4).
  Thus, the final =s of the article occurs on other referential elements, converting them into
determiners. The first element of the article, in turn, can be combined with the first-person
marker , rather than with =s, in possessive noun phrases (cf. 4.1):(33)      a=     pa:ko
          n=1    dog
          ‘my dog’63
   In demonstratives that end in a glottal stop, the clitic is attached to the release vowel that follows the glottal
stop; cf. 2.3.2, 3.9.3.","[162, 163, 164]"
"70
  In Movima, many words contain more than one root. This is generally the result of
compounding, as in (9), or incorporation, as in (10). Phasal verbs, illustrated in (11), contain
two verbal roots, the first encoding an aspectual category, the latter denoting the event (cf.
10.7).(9)     wa:ka-to:da
        cow-BR.piece
        ‘beef, meat’(10)    sal-a-to:wa
        search-DR-path
        ‘to look for a path’(11)    ba:-pul-ay’
        finish-sweep-INT
        ‘to finish sweeping’A bound noun root is always glossed as ‘BR’ to show that the root alone cannot form an
independent noun, even though it can be the only lexical morpheme in an independent noun
(cf. (5)–(7)). In contrast, when a noun is not glossed by ‘BR’, such as to:wa ‘path’ in (10),
this means that the noun can occur independently. Verb roots are not specifically marked (cf.
pul- in (11)).
  In words containing more than one root, such as (9)–(11), I consider the first root as the
principal root, to which another root is subsequently attached. This is because lexical
elements that cannot occur as the only lexical morpheme in a word, presented in 3.2 below
and, in more detail, in 5.3.3 and 5.3.4, are always the second element in complex words.
Roots that occur as the second lexical morpheme within one word, can therefore be seen as
secondary elements as well.
  A base is any form to which another element can be attached. A base can consist of a root,
such as tikoy- ‘kill’ in (12)a, or of a root and one or more additional elements, like chi-poj-
‘take out’ in (12)b, which consists of a root and a causative suffix. In (12)a and (12)b, the
direct voice suffix -na is attached to these bases. Together with -na, these words can form
bases for further affixation, too. For example, the nominalizing suffix -wa can be added, as in
(12)c.(12)    a. tikoy-na      b. chi-poj-na            c. chi-poj-na:-wa
           kill-DR          go_out-CAU-DR            go_out-CAU-DR-NMZ
           ‘I kill X.’      ‘I take X out.’          ‘my taking X out’A base can be quite complex, as is illustrated in (13). The structure of the base in (13)a is
shown in (13)b.(13)    a. tan-a-risa-cha-ye:-pa
           cut-DR-BR.hair-DR2-BE.person-AG

           tan-a-ri:sa               ‘I cut X’s hair.’ (cut-DR-BR.hair)
           tan-a-risa-cha-ye         ‘to cut X’s hair’ (cut-DR-BR.hair-DR2-BE.person)
           tan-a-risa-cha-ye:-pa     ‘person who cuts people’s hair (i.e., hairdresser)’
                                     (cut-DR-BR.hair-DR2-BE.person-AG)
3.2.    Bound lexical elements
There is a large number of bound morphemes with lexical content, many of which have a
classificatory function. These occur in compounds (cf. 3.4), incorporated into verbs (cf. 3.5),
and on certain verbs and adjectives which obligatorily require a bound lexical element (cf.
3.10.4–3.10.6).
  Most of these elements are noun roots (cf. 3.1, 5.3.2), since they can also occur as the first
lexical element of a noun. Example (14)a shows the bound root ba ‘BR.round’ as the second
element of a compound, and (14)b shows it as the root of a noun:(14)    a. mo’incho:-ba                b. ba~ba:-kwa
           chivé-BR.round                 RED~BR.round-ABS
           ‘cake of chivé’                ‘fruit’Other bound lexical elements, however, cannot function as the root of a word: there is no
word of which they constitute the first lexical element, as ba: does in (14)b. An example is
the element -vos ‘BE.wood’, which has to be attached to another base. In (16), it forms a
compound with a noun, in (16), it is incorporated into a verb.(15)    ko’o:-vos
        tree-BE.wood
        ‘wood’(16)    pek-a:-vos
        lift-DR-BE.wood
        ‘to lift wood’These bound elements will be described in more detail in 5.3.4.
  A number of bound nominal elements are the result of the truncation of an independent
noun, to be discussed in detail in 5.3.3. For example, the noun po’so ‘chicha’ has a truncated
form -so, which can be incorporated into verbs or form a compound with another noun:(17)    kwajta’-so
        maize-TRC.chicha
        ‘maize beer’
72
Some bound elements have a verbal character, since they denote an event. They are found
most often in phasal verbs, i.e., in combination with a verb root that indicates phasal aspect.
Unlike real verb roots in a phasal verb (cf. also (11) above), a bound element in a phasal verb
is not followed by a phasal suffix (such as -ay’ in (11)). An example of the bound verbal
element -bu ‘BE.eat’ is given (18). Phasal verbs are described in 10.8.4.(18)    ba:-bu
        finish-BE.eat
        ‘to finish eating’
3.3.    Affixes
An affix is a bound grammatical morpheme. Unlike internal clitics, which resemble affixes
(cf. 3.9), affixes create a phonological word that follows the stress and lengthening rules
outlined in 2.8.1 and 2.8.2. Most affixes in Movima are suffixes. There is one prefix, the
oblique marker n- (cf. 4.6, 7.6). Two suffixes, -a ‘DR’ and -ka ‘MLT’ can occur as infixes (cf.
3.6 below). There is also one “real” infix whose position is determined by metric properties of
the entire base (cf. 3.6 below). In addition, there are several reduplicative affixes, which are
essentially prefixing (cf. 3.7 below).
  Usually, both the base and the affix retain their phonological shape when combined. Major
exceptions are the following. First of all, as was shown in 2.7.1, after a vowel, vowel-initial
affixes are represented by a consonant-initial allomorph. Second, the agentive voice marker
-e e, shown in (19)a, loses its final vowel before another suffix, as in (19)b.(19)    a. lat-e: e          b. lat-e -wa
           chop-AGT             chop-AGT-NMZ
           ‘to chop’            ‘chopping’Third, the applicative suffix -e and the segment /e / of the agentive suffix -e e are not overtly
realized after a base ending in / /. This will be described in detail in 9.7.
  On some bases ending in / /, this consonant is omitted before a suffix, as in (20). More
research is required here.(20)    a. ba:ye             b. baye:-wa
           hunt                 hunt-NMZ
           ‘to hunt’            ‘hunting’For the time being, I consider all Movima affixes derivational. Some categories often cited as
typical examples of inflection, since they are conditioned by their morphosyntactic
environment, are not encoded by affixes in Movima: the noun morphology does not contain
markers for case or number; in the verb morphology, there are no agreement affixes, and
tense, aspect and mood are not systematically encoded by affixes either (cf. Ch. 10 for verbal
affixes which involve aspect and mood). Nominal number and person are encoded by
pronominal clitics (cf. 4.7), and most TAM categories by particles (cf. Ch. 12). The only                                                                                              73
affixes which may be considered inflectional are the markers of direct or inverse voice (cf.
8.1), distributed on the basis of semantic and pragmatic factors. However, I will not enter into
this discussion here.
  The most important grammatical categories expressed by affixes in Movima include:(21)    On nominal bases:
        Verbalization
        Absolute state(22)    On verbal bases:
        Nominalization
        Voice
        Causative
        Benefactive, Malefactive
        Applicatives
        Mood: Irrealis, desiderative, imperative
        Phasal Aspect
        Multiple event
3.4.    Compounding
Compounding (described in detail in 5.2) is very productive in Movima. The first part of a
compound can be a noun, an adjective, or a verb root (cf. 3.10). The second part is usually a
bound root (cf. 3.1) or another bound nominal element (cf. 3.2), but it can also be a full noun.
  The wordhood of a compound is straightforward when the second element cannot occur
independently, i.e., when it is a bound nominal element (cf. 5.3), such as the bound root -bun
in (23):(23)    mo’incho:-bun
        chivé-BR.mass
        ‘chivé mass’In contrast, when both its elements can function as independent words, the wordhood of a
compound is more difficult to determine, since both parts retain their stress pattern. The first
element, however, only receives secondary stress:(24)    wa:ka-ba:ri
        cow-foot
        [ wa:ka' a: i]
        ‘cow foot’Clear phonological evidence for the fact that the two words form a compound is when the first
element is a native word with an open penultimate syllable, whose length is prosodically
conditioned (cf. Ch2-Length). In compounding, this syllable is shortened, since it is not the
penultimate anymore (cf. 2.8.2):74
(25)    a. bi:jaw             ‘old’
        b. bijaw-kwe:ya       ‘old woman’(26)    a. ape:re             ‘Apere river’
        b. apere-ben‘i        ‘the lands of the Apere river’Some compounds can be identified because of an intervening linking nasal (cf. 2.9.3), as in
(27), or because of nasal assimilation, as in (28).(27)    itilakwa-n-dichi:ye
        man-LN-child
        ‘little boy’(28)    alwamben-mari:ko
        paper-bag
        [ alwam' p mma' i:k ]
        ‘paper bag’Since there are many cases which provide phonological evidence for compounding, it can be
assumed that two adjacent content words, the second of which is a noun, within one syntactic
slot form one single compound. I will come back to this in the analysis of attributive
adjectives (cf. 3.10.4 below).","[93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98]"

In contrast to the enclitic pronouns (cf. 3.9.1, 3.9.2), the proclitics are not phonologically
cliticized to their syntactic host. Usually, they precede the syntactic host directly, as in (1)a,
and only a TAM-particle can appear in between, as in (1)b:(1)        a. kwey      i         pe -a:-cho

                ‘I just tore X [e.g. a cloth].’As was shown in 2.9.5 and 3.9.3, some pronouns are either phonologically cliticized to a
preceding element with a final vowel, or they are combined with the dummy element i (cf.
2.9.5). This is the case with the proclitics, which consist of a single consonant, and with the
enclitics of Set 2, which have an initial consonant cluster. Example (2) shows the vowel-
initial form of a Set 2 enclitic after a consonant, and (3) shows the consonant-initial form,
which appears after a vowel:(2)        tijka:rim--iy’ i
           work--1pl
           ‘We (excl.) work.’(3)        joro:-kwa--y’ i
           sleep-BDP--1pl
           ‘We (excl.) sleep.’The enclitics of Set 1 have only a consonant-initial form, since they always follow a vowel

           ART.n.a     field-LV=1pl
           ‘our field’132
The Set 1 enclitic encoding the second person singular is the only non-syllabic enclitic, =n:(5)        kos          bay im-a=n
           ART.n.a      field-LV=2
           ‘your field’4.1.2. Morphological and semantic properties of SAP referential elements
As can be seen in (6), the free pronouns distinguish five discrete categories of speech-act-
participants:(6)        1st singular         in a
           1st plural           iy’ i
           1st inclusive        i:de59
           2nd singular         ulkwan
           2nd plural           iy’bikweIn the system of bound pronouns, in contrast, these five persons are not encoded as discrete
categories within one single paradigm. This can be seen clearly with the markers of Set 1,
which are repeated in Table 7:
Table 7. Bound pronouns of Set 1
                 proclitic        internal clitic1st sg           (i)              –
1st incl         (i)              =n
1st excl         (i)              =y’ i
2nd sg           –                =n
2nd pl           –                =nkweIt can be seen that the first person has a special status in this paradigm. All persons in which
the first person is involved are encoded by the proclitic (i) : first person singular, first person
plural (“me and others”), and first person inclusive (“me and you”). The non-first persons, in
contrast, are specified by the enclitic markers. Especially the marking of the first person
inclusive is significant, because it consists of the combination of the first-person proclitic
marker and the enclitic marker of the second person. It is because of this pattern that I do not
analyse the first person singular as a zero enclitic, but as not belonging to the enclitic
paradigm at all.
   When compared to the other non-first persons (including third persons, cf. 4.2 below), the
second person of Set 1 also has a special morphological status. First of all, as was mentioned59
   The first person inclusive not only includes first and second person singular, i.e. ‘me and you (sg)’, but can
refer to more persons, e.g. ‘us and you (pl.)’.","[154, 155, 156]"

are narrated that took place in the speaker’s childhood or in a dream. This function is possibly
related to the indication of hearsay knowledge (cf. (183)–(185)). Example (191) is from a
dream narration, example (192) is from a childhood narration:(191)    an jankwa ney in a,               yey-na, pa’,

12.4. The focus particle kaw
The construction with kaw (often pronounced as kwey, see further below) was already
discussed in 7.8. It is a focus marker, the most salient property of which is to reduce the
valency of a bivalent verb. It thereby enables the former ARG1 to occur as the absolutive
argument in topic position. In addition, kaw has another, possessor-marking function. In this
section, I will first describe the possessor-marking function of kaw. After that, I discuss the
difference between this particle and the often homophonous tense particle kwey (cf. 12.2.1).
  The possessor-marking function of kaw may be related to its focalizing function described
in 7.8 (and cf. below for further examples). In this function, illustrated in (197) and (198), it
precedes a noun which is a generic term for the possessed entity. Together, the two words
denote the possessor of the entity. The possessum can be specified by an oblique noun phrase,
underlined in the following examples:(197)    is        mere’ ko’ kis              neyru, o’im, o’im-vos

         [lit.: “there was no domestic-animal-owner of them.’] {GB, Ganado 004}Curiously, the possessor-denoting expression with kaw is most often found as a lexical
expression in combination with the oblique-marked first person singular pronoun in a:(199)     kaw     n-in a
        ~ kwey    n-in a
          FOC     obl-PRO.1sg
          ‘owner’Also with this expression, the possessum can be specified by an oblique-marked noun phrase
(as in (197) and (198) above):(200)    bo       as      iy’ i-ni-wa            kwey    n-in a      n-as       akamba

The expression kwey nin a ‘owner’ occurs twice in (202) below. In this example, it can be
seen that the possessive-marking function of kaw can sometimes not be formally
distinguished from its focus function. Here, it occurs with the word asna ‘home’, which is
morphologically a verb. I will elaborate on this phrase below.(202)   di:ra tochi’ kwaj-na=y’ i kos            sinko-pe:so n-i’nes     kwey n-in a

        ART.f Modesta        PRO.f FOC obl-PRO.1sg obl-ART.n water
        ‘At least we give a small five pesos to the owner of the water of the tap, she is the
        owner of the house here [lit.: “she is the one who sits here”], Modesta, she is the
        owner of the water.’                                    {EA, Agua sucia 020}The phrase i’ne kwey asna ney in this example can be translated in two ways: as ‘she is the
one who sits here’ or, more appropriate in this context, as ‘she is the owner of the house here’.
The first translation is literal, while the second takes the lexicalized meaning of the word
asna, ‘home’, as basis. This example, where the category of a word oscillates between verb
and noun, shows that possessive marking may have developed out of the focus-marking
function.
  As could be seen in the examples so far, the focus particle has two variants: kaw and kwey.
Some speakers always use kwey, others generally use kaw and sometimes kwey. When asked,
speakers confirm the exchangeability of the forms:(203)       iy’ i      kaw        sal-na
        ~   iy’ i      kwey       sal-na
            PRO.1pl FOC           search-DR
            ‘We look for it.’                                                {ER 11, 015}For the tense particle kwey (cf. 12.2.1), there is no variant kaw. Therefore, I refer to the focus
particle as kaw. However, since the two particles are often homophonous, I will point out their
differences here.
  Apart from the fact that kaw can be realized as kwey, but not the other way round, the
particles differ in that the tense particle kwey is realized as kweyka in certain cases, as in
(204). In contrast, for the particle kaw this is not possible, as shown by (205)b.(204)   bo        jayna kweyka      ji:sa   kos      konvokato:riya

the behaviour of bivalent verbs. The tense particle kwey (cf. (206)) typically occurs in clause-
initial position, while in a clause with kaw, this position is usually occupied by a free pronoun
(underlined):(206)   kwey in        ji<wa:~>wa
        IMM 1intr come<MD~>
        ‘I came earlier today.’                                             {EA, Visita 031}(207)   jayna isne        kwey joy-che

the verb. This means that the original ARG1 becomes the intransitive argument, encoded by a
free pronoun in topic position. The original ARG2 becomes an oblique argument, marked by
n- (cf. 7.6, 7.8). In contrast, with the tense particle, the valency of the verb is retained. The
difference can be seen in (208)a and b, respectively:(208)   a. kaw: focus, valency reduction:
           i’ne    kwey toroj-na       n-as      ro:ya
           PRO.f FOC dust-DR           obl-ART.n house

valency reduction indeed go together. Example (209)a shows that when the verb remains
bivalent, ARG1 cannot be put in focus. Example (209)b, in contrast, shows that when there is
no free pronoun in topic position, the valency of the verb cannot be reduced:(209)   a. ungrammatical: focus, no valency reduction:

                                                                                             539

only be stressed when it is the tense marker, as in (206). In the case of the focus particle kaw,
as in (207), stress always falls on the free pronoun, not on the particle.
  The question is whether the focus particle kaw and the tense particle kwey have anything in
common, since the focus particle kaw is pronounced as kwey by many speakers. The
translations of some clauses that contain the focus particle suggest that this particle implies
past tense as well. A case of this type is given in (210):(210)    u’ko    kwey loj-na=u          kis               sapato=u
         PRO.m FOC wash-DR=m ART.pl.a                     shoe=m

which exclude a past-tense reading. This can be seen when other tense particles or adverbial
clauses are involved. The three following examples are marked for future tense, incompatible
with the past-tense particle kwey, which implies the occurrence of an event before the moment
of speaking. Here, the form kwey can only represent the focus particle kaw. In (211), the
particles nokowa ‘right now’ (cf. 12.2.4) and loy ‘intentional’ (cf. 12.3.2) indicate future
tense:272(211)    jay e nokowa        loy ney=s           imay-ni,

        {JM, Perro II 020}In (212), the event referred to is a habitual action, and the particle nokowa ‘right now’
indicates future tense (cf. 12.2.4):(212)    ka’       jayna      rujalniwa:-wa     n-as       as-na=n

3.5.    Incorporation
Noun incorporation, by which a noun or, more commonly, a bound nominal element is
inserted into a verb, is very productive as well. There are two types of noun incorporation:
argument incorporation and modifier incorporation. Argument incorporation is identified by
the fact that the verb contains the bivalent direct voice marker (cf. 8.1.1), but is used
intransitively (cf. 7.7 and 9.1):(29)    in     sal-a-ka:na
        1intr search-DR-food
        ‘I look for food’ [lit.: “I food-search”]A verb with an incorporated modifier, in contrast, can appear with any voice marker (cf. 9.2),
in which case it is also clearly recognizable as a verb (as in (30)a). It can, however, also
appear without a voice affix, which marks the resultative voice (as in (30)b). In this case, it
cannot be formally distinguished from an adjective (cf. 3.10.5)(30)    a. ra -a-pin                     b. ra -pin
           tear-DR-BE.half                  tear-BE.half
           ‘I tear it in the middle.’       ‘to be torn in the middle’
                                                                                            75
In certain cases, verb roots, or even full verbs, can be incorporated into a verb. This is very
productive with verbs encoding phasal aspect. As is shown in 10.8, three verb roots have been
found which, together with an incorporated root and combined with the suffixes -u’/-ay’ or
-kaka , create a phasal verb. These roots are ba:- ‘finish’, as in (31) (cf. also (11) above), nan-
‘set free’, as in (32), and pen- ‘land’, as in (33). There may be more. Consider the following
examples, with the incorporated verb root in bold-face:(31)    ba:-tijkarim-kaka
        finish-work-PH
        ‘to finish working’(32)    nan-sit-ay’
        let_loose-sew-PH
        ‘to stop sewing (without having finished)’(33)    pen-sam-u’
        land-twist-PH
        ‘to start weaving’In other cases in which a verb root is apparently incorporated, this, in fact, is rather a case of
noun incorporation. For example, the root joro ‘sleep’ is found in the verb joro:-kwa ‘to
sleep’ (cf. 8.3.2.1). However, this morpheme has more parallels with a noun root than with a
verb root. Like most noun roots, it can constitute an independent word (cf. 3.1), which, like
nouns, typically occurs in a noun phrase (cf. 3.10.2). This is shown in (34):(34)    as       jo:ro
        ART.n sleep
        ‘(the) sleep, sleepiness’Therefore, when a root of this type is incorporated, as in (35) below, this can be seen as a case
of noun incorporation. In the case of phasal verbs, the difference from verb root incorporation
is also apparent from the fact that no suffix is required, unlike the case with incorporated verb
roots shown in (31)–(33).(35)    ba:-jo:ro
        finish-sleep
        ‘to finish sleeping’The incorporation of verb roots and bound lexical elements into phasal verbs is discussed in
more detail in 10.8.","[98, 99]"
"4.8.3. The absential referential elements as markers of evidentiality
Apart from spatial and temporal categories, the absential referential elements also seem to
encode an evidential category. While more detailed research is required here, I will point out
some phenomena which suggest this.
   First of all, absential referential elements are used with concrete referents whose exact
location or existence is not known, even when the referent is believed to be near the speech
situation. Consider the following examples:(147)   koro’      na-kal     kos  kucha:ra
        DM.a.n obl-DM.ad.n ART.n.a spoon
        ‘Is the spoon there?’                                               {EA, DEM 089}(148)   koro’     joy kos          toda-n-kwa          n-as         bari=‘ne, an
        DM.a.n SPC ART.n.a BR.piece-LN-ABS obl-ART.n foot=f                    EV
        ‘Probably she (present) has a piece (of something) in her foot, don’t you think?’
        {EA, Dial. 091}The absential referential elements can also be used to refer to concrete entities not yet in
existence at the moment of speaking:(149)   loy i ji:sa:-na ki                  mo’incho
        ITN 1 make-DR ART.pl.a.1            chivé

absential referential elements are also used in instructions, as in (150)−(152).(150)   is-na=n     kis        di~di-n-kwa
        roast-DR=2 ART.pl.a RED~BR.grain-LV-ABS
        ‘You roast the seeds.’                                      {EA, Lo’im 023}
                                                                                             171

        ‘And after that you make a fire.’                       {LY chivé 008}The connection of absential marking and evidentiality can also be seen with regard to the
encoding of abstract concepts. This is only apparent in non-past contexts, since in past-tense
contexts, these concepts are automatically referred to by an absential or past article (as shown
in the previous sections). Consider the following examples:(153)    e a kos        jeya=n
        what ART.n.a state_of=2
        ‘What’s the matter with you?’                                  {JM, Perro I 029}(154)   é e a kos          kemara     kal=s powol

        ‘What is that straw mat for?’                                    {EA 9, 036}(155)   n-as       salmo-wa=sne      joychoy rey

        ‘When she comes back, I don’t know what I’ll do.’            {EA, Vuelta hija 001}In each of these examples, an abstract concept is referred to: somebody’s state of being (cf.
(153)), the purpose of an artifact (cf. (154)), and an activity (cf. (155)). The speaker knows
that these concepts “exist” or will exist, but does not know their exact identity. Transferred
into the spatial domain, this is comparable to the situation when the speaker knows an object
to be around, but does not know its exact location (cf. (147) and (148) above).
  The examples (156) and (157) below may give a similar impression as (153)–(155) above.
Here, however, the absential article appears because the events referred to took place just
before the time of speaking. The irrealis mood in these examples, which is reminiscent of the
evidential reading described above, is indicated by the counterfactual marker disoy in (156)
and the verb kemaye ‘mistakenly take X for something else’ in (157).(156)   disoy no-kos           dinkaye-wa=nkwe , disoy di’ man<a>ye=nkwe

As was shown, the referential elements, in particular the article, indicate the location of the
referent with respect to both space and time. Two factors play a role here: the physical and
temporal presence of the referent, be it concrete or abstract, and its physical and temporal
accessibility as perceived by the speaker. With the example of the neuter article, which
displays most distinctions since it is combined with concrete as well as abstract nouns, this is
schematized in Figure 3:84
                        as                          kos                         os
                   +present         –present              +present         –present
                   +accessible      +accessible           –accessible      –accessible
                Figure 3. The article as a marker of presence and perceived accessibility
The features [+present] and [+accessible], which can only be expressed by the presential
article (as), apply to entities which are physically present (i.e., in the speaker’s surroundings),
on the spatial level, and to the time span from the present (the moment of speaking) into the
future, on the temporal level. Obviously, Movima categorizes future events as accessible.
  The absential article (kos) indicates that something is either present or perceived as
accessible, but not both. On the spatial level, it can be applied to concepts which are within
the surroundings of the speaker, but not accessible (e.g. invisible; cf. (147) and (148)). It can
also be applied to concepts which are outside the surroundings of the speaker, but in existence
and therefore perceived as accessible (cf. for instance (88)). On the temporal level, the
absential article marks the time span on the same day, but before the moment of speaking, as
is reflected by its function with temporal and action nouns (cf. 4.8.2.4). Apparently, events
that have occurred within this time span are perceived as accessible, even though they do not
continue at the present moment.
  The category encoded by the past article (os), finally, indicates that something is not present
and that it is perceived as neither spatially nor temporally accessible. The accessibility feature
helps to understand why in Movima, past tense only covers the time span up to the previous
evening: what has occurred the day before usually does not affect us as much as what has
occurred on the same day, and can therefore be perceived as inaccessible.","[194, 195, 196]"
"90
with an open first syllable, this syllable is long due to prosodic factors (cf. 2.8.2). This
prosodic lengthening can be taken into account for reduplication or not. The word ro:ya
‘house’, for example, can be marked for predicative possession in two ways:(96)    a. ro:~ro:ya        ~       b. roya~ro:ya
           POSS~house                  POSS~house
           ‘to own a house’In contrast, words whose first syllable is always long, e.g. disyllabic loans (cf. 2.9.2), do not
permit this variation, since the first syllable is inherently heavy. This is the case with the word
wa:ka ‘cow’ (cf. (95)b above), which cannot undergo disyllabic reduplication:(97)    * waka~wa:ka
          POSS~cow
          (‘to own cows’)Prefixing reduplication marking a possessive predicate can cooccur with infixing
reduplication. In (98), an example is given of a possessive predicate formed of a noun marked
for inalienable possession (cf. 3.7.5). It is structured as follows. In (98)a, the noun charayelo
‘honey’ is marked by infixing reduplication for inalienable possession, as in (92) and (93)a
above, with the possessor expressed by an internally cliticized bound pronoun. In (98)b, the
same noun is marked as a possessive predicate by prefixing foot reduplication; its argument is
expressed by the externally cliticized bound pronoun (cf. 3.9.2, 7.9.1). In (98)c, finally, the
two reduplicative processes occur on the same base: the inalienably possessed noun in (98)a is
marked by prefixing foot reduplication, as in (98)b, as a possessive predicate in a relative
clause.(98)    a. charaye<lo~>lo=is
           syrup-<INAL~>BR.liquid=pl.a
           ‘their honey (of the bees)’        b. chara~charaye:-lo--is

           ‘bees which have (their) honey’ [lit.: “which are honey-owners”] {JM 17, 278}Another case in which both types of reduplication cooccur is when a possessive predicate
occurs in a subordinate or negative clause (cf. (99)a and b, respectively). Here, the noun with
the foot reduplication undergoes additional infixing reduplication (cf. 3.7.4):
                                                                                                91

possessive predicate formed by the irrealis marker -a’ on nouns (cf. 3.6.2):(100)   kas    chara<ka’>ye-lo=i
        NEG syrup<IRR>-BR.liquid=pl

determined by the first iambic foot of the base, as is the position of the irrealis marker. It is
striking that these morphological processes, which are related in meaning but formally quite
distinct, are influenced by the same prosodic feature of the base.","[113, 114, 115]"

9.2.7. Bound elements that are only incorporated as modifiers
Many elements can be incorporated both in argument and in modifying incorporation. This is,
in principle, the case with all elements that denote unpossessed entities, whereas elements that
denote inalienably possessed entities, e.g. parts of wholes, can only be incorporated as
modifiers. However, some other bound nominal elements are also restricted with respect to
the type of incorporation process in which they can participate. In some cases, the same entity
is denoted by two different bound nominal elements, depending on the role it plays in the
event. The element that denotes an entity in the undergoer role participates in argument
incorporation, whereas the element that denotes an entity functioning as instrument, Ground,
etc., can only be incorporated as a modifier.
  The most prominent example of this contrast is the pair -mi ‘TRC.water (as undergoer)’ and
-lo ‘BR.water (as instrument, Ground, etc.)’. The element -mi usually only occurs in
argument incorporation, as shown in (76)a, whereas -lo only occurs in modifying
incorporation, shown in (76)b.(76)    a. loy in         ye -a:-mi

           ‘I’ll pour it in the water.’Elicitation has shown that the element -mi can also occur as an incorporated modifier, with
the same meaning as -lo (cf. (77)). However, the form with -lo is always preferred.(77)    a. loy i       kon-a-mi-ne                is                  do’we

9.2.8. Incorporation of more than one modifier
Many words can be analysed as containing more than one incorporated modifier. Often, these
words are not fully transparent, so that this can be ascribed to lexicalization: a historically
complex base incorporates a modifying element.",[410]

example shows this difference clearly: Santa Cruz is a place name and is therefore referred to
by the presential article. Terminal ‘bus station’ denotes a place as well, but the specific
reference is only clear from the context. Therefore, here the absential article is used.(93)    in    joy-che n-as           kaykaja e:-wa            no-kos  terminal

         ‘When I was a child, oh dear how much I liked sweets.’ {EA 13, 254}Thus, the presential forms are used not just for entities close by, but also for certain entities
that are absent from the speech situation. In the following sections, it will furthermore become
apparent that the presential forms are also used for certain referents out of existence.
Therefore, I regard the presential referential elements as pragmatically unmarked.78
4.8.2. Existence and ceased existence79
The system of referential elements not only encodes the accessibility of a referent on the
spatial, but also on the temporal level: it indicates whether the referent still exists at the time
of speaking or whether it has ceased to exist. The marking of existence is used to encode tense
in discourse in a way similar to verbal tense marking in other languages. In Movima, the only
other means of encoding tense apart from the referential elements is by particles (cf. 12.2).
Therefore, I refer to the referential elements that indicate ceased existence as “past”.80
  Existence and ceased existence are most clearly indicated by the article and by the
demonstratives, because these morpheme classes have special forms for referents that existed
in the past, but do not exist anymore on the day of speaking. In the pronominal system,
referents that have ceased to exist are encoded by the absential markers. In the present
description of the existence-marking function of referential elements, I will concentrate on the
article. A brief description of the past demonstratives will be given in 4.9.3 below, and in
4.10, I describe the interaction between the past forms of the article and the demonstratives
and the absential forms of the bound and free pronouns.
  In order to understand the categories of existence and ceased existence, it is necessary to
know the three basic temporal categories distinguished in Movima:(99)          past           =         up to and into the previous night
              immediate past =         from the night up to the moment of speaking
              non-past       =         from the moment of speaking onwardsThe general connection between these categories and the category of existence as marked by
the article is as follows: the past article is used for referents which existed up to the previous
night; the absential article is used for referents which existed on the same day, but do not exist
anymore at the moment of speaking; finally, referents which exist at the moment of speaking
or will exist in the future are encoded either by the presential or by the absential article,78
   Morphologically, however, they do not display a marked-unmarked distinction.
79
   Parts of this and the following sections were published in Haude (2004).
80
   The striking property of the Movima article to indicate “past tense” was also noted by R. Judy (1965).","[179, 180, 181]"
"
1.1.      The name of the language
The term Movima, pronounced [mo’ ima] in Spanish, originally refers to the ethnic group
that speaks this language. The native term is mowi:maj, pronounced [m 'wi:mah].
   The Movima language is referred to by Spanish-speaking locals as el idioma (‘the
language’) or el dialecto (‘the dialect’). In Movima, it is called chonsine (‘native language’,
literally ‘right sound’), a term also used to refer to other native languages. More specifically,
the language is referred to as chonsine di’ mowi:maj (‘native language Movima’).
   Movima is the only name known for the language. Only minor spelling differences are
encountered in the literature. In the first written record, from 1621 (cf. 1.3 below), it is
referred to as “moyma” or “moima”. Créqui-Montfort & Rivet (1914) spell it “mobima”. All
these spellings are more or less faithful to the pronunciation of the word (<v> and <b> in the
Spanish spelling represent the phoneme / /). However, Métraux (1942) confusingly spells it
as Móvima, with an accent on the o. Since stress is on the penultimate syllable, this must be a
misspelling.
   Dialectal varieties of the language have not yet been discovered.",[24]
"
8.2. The voice markers on verbs in argument function
In the previous sections, it was stressed that each voice marker indicates the semantic role of
the absolutive argument, i.e., ARG2 of a bivalent and ARGintr of a monovalent predicate. This
may seem arbitrary, since the bivalent markers -a/-na and -kay indicate the semantic role of
ARG1 as well (actor and undergoer, respectively). However, the point becomes clear when
verbs in argument function are taken into account, a phenomenon already introduced in 7.10
above. As was said there, the referent of a verbal NP is always the absolutive argument of the
verb. The semantic role of this argument is specified by the voice markers. Consider the
following examples of monovalent verbs in argument function. In (70), the agentive marker
-e e specifies the referent as the actor:(70)    kas      rey      soka’<te~>te=us               rey bat-e: e
        NEG again only_person<NMZ.N~>=m.a again put-AGT
        ‘It was not just one (man), you know, who contributed something.’
        [lit.: “…who put.”]                                           {GB, Ganado 107}In (71), the reflexive/reciprocal marker also specifies the referent as the actor. Here, the verb
root is of the inherently monovalent type, on which the suffix -che indicates agentivity of the
participant (cf. 8.3.2):(71)    pe’ e e jemay kwe:ya is           joy-che di’ kay~kay
        all      pure   woman ART.pl go-R/R REL MD~eat
        ‘Only women went there to eat.’                     {EA, Llamada 019}
        [lit.: “Only women were the going ones who ate.”]The following examples illustrate the case of resultative verbs in argument function. In (72),
the verbal base consists of a simple root, therefore it is augmented by the dummy element -‘i.
In (73), the verb is unmarked for voice. In both cases, the referent of the NP is the element
that undergoes the result of the action denoted by the verbal base:(72)    i:ri        ‘i:          ney is        kwey      dej-’i    di’ n-i’ne
        DM.spk.pl DM.spk.pl here ART.pl IMM              cook-D    REL obl-PRO.f
        ‘Here is what has just been cooked for her.’                      {EA 19, 315d}
                                                                                             337

        ‘After a few days I looked at the broken [part].’       {ER, Sapo 016}When bivalent verbs occur in an NP, the voice marker indicates whether the referent is the
actor or the undergoer. When the verb is marked as direct, in which case ARG2 is the
undergoer, then this also is the semantic role of the referent of the NP:(74)    jayna da’             o<ko:~>kon is           dej-na=sne di’ lo:kwa
        DSC DUR.nst boil<MD~>                ART.pl cook-DR=f.a REL locro
        ‘What she was cooking, which was locro, was already boiling.’ [lit.: “her cooked
        (stuff), which was locro, was already boiling.”]            {EA, Ay’ku I 048}(75)    kas rey kay-wa=as              n-os          rey en-a- a:ba

        ‘It [the dog] didn’t eat, you know, the [things] I put on the ground.’ {JM, Perro I 006}The following examples illustrate an inverse verb in an NP. Since the absolutive argument of
an inverse verb encodes the actor in the event, the referent of these NPs is the actor of the
event denoted by the verb base.(76)    jayna ji<wa:~>wa us          rey yey-kay-a=n          di’ naye-sicha’kwa
        DSC come<MD~> ART.m again want-INV-LV=2 REL marry-DES
        ‘The one who wants you, who wants to marry, has already come.’ {JA, Naye 052}(77)    jan-ne               as      pen-kay
        which-BE.person ART.n greet-INV
        ‘Who is it that is talking to me?’                         {EA, Antes de fiesta 008}From the syntactic point of view, all verbs in argument function can be interpreted as either
agentive or objective nominals (cf. Comrie & Thompson 1985: 351ff.), depending on their
voice markers. The NPs in (72)–(75) can, then, be translated as objective nouns: “(the)
cooked stuff”, “the/a broken thing”, “her cooked stuff” and “my left-on-ground stuff”,
respectively. The NPs in (70)–(71) can be seen as agentive nominals: “the/a putter”, “the/a
goer”. And the NPs in (76) and (77) would have to be translated as “the you-wanter who
wants to marry” and “the me-greeter”, respectively.
  A crucial property of these NPs is that the valency of the verb identifies the NP as possessed
or unpossessed. An NP containing a verb with a monovalent voice marker is unpossessed,
whereas an NP with a bivalent voice marker is possessed. This is due to the fact that ARG1 of
a bivalent predicate is obligatorily encoded, whereas a monovalent predicate does not have an
ARG1, and that the encoding of ARG1 is identical to possessor encoding.
  Thus, while the voice markers indicate the semantic valency of a verb, their other central
function is to establish the absolutive argument of the verb, which represents the participant
referred to when the verb occurs in an NP. They may even be thought of as nominalizers338
which overtly specify the noun as possessed or unpossessed. However, more research is
needed to confirm whether the voice markers can synchronically be analysed as nominalizers.","[360, 361, 362]"

1.7. History of linguistic description
The first materials of the Movima language are lists of words and phrases (Hervás y Panduro
1787, D’Orbigny 1838, Heath 1883, Cardús 1886, Chamberlain 1910, Créqui-Montfort &
Rivet 1914, del Castillo 1929). Of these older lists, the one produced by the missionary
Cardús (1886) is most reproduced in the literature. In the 1960s, Movima was studied
extensively by Robert and Judith Judy of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. The results
include a word list with a grammatical sketch (1962a), an outline of the phoneme inventory
(1962b), two articles on specific topics (J. Judy 1965 and R. Judy 1965), and a tagmemic
grammar (1965 and 1967).
  A government-financed alphabetization campaign led by Colette Grinevald in 1995 raised
new interest in the language. An alphabet was created by the speakers, mainly based on the
orthography used by Judy and Judy, but with some changes (most importantly, c and qu were
replaced by k). The workshops, furthermore, resulted in the publication of a collection of
stories in Movima (Ministerio de Desarrollo Sostenible y Planificación 1998) and in a course
book introducing the alphabet (Ministerio de Educación et al. 2003). Also, Colette Grinevald
published an article on Movima noun classifiers (Grinevald 2002). Of the several unpublished
materials inspired by the workshops, an extensive word list by Eligardo Chirimani (1998)
deserves special mention. It needs to be said that without those workshops, the present
grammar may not have been written: it is because of the interest expressed by the Movima
participants that Movima was proposed to me as a language of research.
  The present research project is part of the Spinoza project “Lexicon and Syntax” directed by
Pieter Muysken, which aims at describing as many of the language isolates in Amazonian
Bolivia and Brazil as possible. It is hoped that it will serve as a basis for the production of
materials that will help the Movimas to teach and learn their ancestral language.",[29]
"                                                                                                     107
As can be observed from the list in (163) above, verbs are typically morphologically complex.
Unlike noun roots, most verb roots cannot occur on their own. When unmarked, which is the
case when they appear in the resultative voice (cf. 8.1.5), these roots are combined with the
dummy element -‘i (cf. 2.9.5):(168)   sal-’i     ‘to have been/have to be searched’
        ju:-’i     ‘to have been/have to be scolded’
        toroj-’i   ‘to have been/have to be dusted’There are only a few unanalysable verbs, such as ja:yi ‘run’ in (163). Examples of other verbs
of this type, which may be historically complex, include the following (with a tentative
morphological analysis, where possible):(169)   ilo:ni   ‘to walk, move forward’ (-ni ‘PRC’)
        iwa:ni   ‘to converse’            (-ni ‘PRC’)
        ya:lo:we ‘to drink’             (ya:- ‘under’?, -lo ‘BE.liquid’, -we ‘BE.person’)
        jo’yaj   ‘to arrive’
        salmo    ‘to return’Thus, while verbs are generally morphologically complex, this is not a defining characteristic
that distinguishes them from nouns.
  The defining feature of a verb is that it cannot be combined with nominal morphemes (cf.
(174) below). Furthermore, verbs are productively combined with typical verbal morphemes,
for example:(170)   -wa        action/state nominalization
        -pa        agent nominalization
        -poj       causative
        -kwa       benefactive
        -ka        immediative/impossibilitive
        -u’~-ay’   intensive
3.10.2. Nouns
Nouns prototypically express time-stable concepts. Accordingly, the following can be seen as
prototypical Movima nouns:(171)   champa       ‘stone’
        ro:ya        ‘house’
        pa:ko        ‘dog’
        kwe:ya       ‘woman’
        china a      ‘manioc’
        ko’o         ‘tree’
        me:sa        ‘table’
        Leonilda     proper name108
A noun typically occurs in a noun phrase. A noun phrase is defined by the fact that it contains
a determining referential element, usually an article, that specifies gender, number, and deictic
properties of the referent (cf. 4.4). In (172), noun phrases are given which contain the above
nouns:(172)   as    champa       ‘the/a stone’
        as    ro:ya        ‘the/a house’
        as    pa:ko        ‘the/a dog’
        i’nes kwe:ya       ‘the/a woman’
        is    china a      ‘(the) manioc roots’
        as    ko’o         ‘the/a tree’
        as    me:sa        ‘the/a table’
        i’nes Leonilda     ‘Leonilda’The occurrence in a noun phrase is not restricted to nouns: verbs can occur in a noun phrase
as well, as was shown in 3.10.1. And while this is more typical of verbs, a noun can also
occur outside a noun phrase, in which case it functions as a predicate (cf. 7.9.1). In (173)a and
b, the noun kwe:ya ‘woman’ is combined with referential elements representing the
arguments of the equational clauses.(173)   a. in    kwe:ya            b. kwe:ya--‘ne
           1intr woman                woman--f
           ‘I am a woman.’            ‘She is a woman.’Since nouns can function as predicates and verbs can occur in noun phrases, the syntactic
position is not a defining property of these word classes.
  A typical morphological property of nouns is that most of them, unlike most verbs, can
consist of a single root. The nouns in (171) and (172) are examples of independent roots.
However, since some noun roots cannot occur independently (cf. 3.1, 5.3.2), while some,
probably historically complex, verb roots can (cf. 3.10.1 below), this is not a defining
characteristic for distinguishing nouns from verbs, either.
  The defining characteristic of nouns is that the morphemes in (174) can only be attached to
nominal bases, but not to verbs:(174)   -ti’       VBZ           (‘to make N’)
        -maj       VLC           (‘to be in/on N’)
        -ni        PRC           (‘to be/become N’)
        Foot~      POSS          (‘owner of N’)
        <CV~>      NMZ.N         (‘being N’)The most productive distinction between nouns and verbs is the form that verbal predicates
and predicate nominals take in negative or subordinate clauses. When the predicate is a
morphological noun, it is marked by infixing reduplication (<CV~>), as in (175)a and b. A
                                                                                             109
verbal predicate, in contrast, receives the suffix -wa in a subordinate or negative clause, as
shown in (176)a and b:(175)   a. n-as       kwe<ya:~>ya               b. kas       kwe<ya:~>ya
           obl-ART.n woman<NMZ.N~>                 NEG       woman<NMZ.N~>
           ‘when I am a woman’                     ‘I am not a woman.’(176)   a. n-as       iloni:-wa                 b. kas       iloni:-wa
           obl-ART.n walk-NMZ                      NEG       walk-NMZ
           ‘when I walk’                           ‘I don’t walk.’However, while a verb cannot take the nominal suffixes in (174), this does not mean that a
base that can be combined with the verbal suffixes in (170) above. Nouns can be combined
with these suffixes, even though this is of limited productivity and may be the result of a more
complicated process, which can be outlined as follows.
  The verbalizing suffix -ti’, described in 11.5, is one of the most productive derivational
elements. It creates an monovalent verb that denotes a typical activity connected with the

        1intr armadillo-VBZ
        ‘I hunt armadillo.’Like any other verb, the denominal verbs derived by the suffix -ti’ can receive additional verb
morphology. However, as is also the case with most monovalent voice suffixes, the suffix -ti’
is omitted before another suffix is attached (cf. 8.7.1 and 11.5). The meaning of the base
remains the same as when it contains the verbal suffix -ti’. Consider first the examples in
(179) of the nominalizing suffix -wa (cf. (176)) attached to the bases in (177) and (178)
above:(179)   a. n-as         roya:-wa   b. n-as         sutulra:-wa

            ‘when I build a house’     ‘when I hunted armadillo’
          * ’when I am a house’      * ‘when I am an armadillo’Here, the bases ro:ya- and sutulra- are not nouns, but the verbal bases ‘build a house’ and
‘hunt armadillo’, respectively, whose suffix -ti’ is omitted before further suffixation. When
nominal bases occur independently as a predicate, they denotes the state of ‘being X’ (cf. also
(173) above):

in (170) identify a base as verbal.52
  An interesting case of words which are considered verbs from the semantic point of view,
but which are morphologically nouns, concerns the words jankwa ‘say’ and jampa ‘do like’.
One indication that these are rather nouns than verbs is that, when nominalized, they first
undergo verbalization by -ni ‘PRC’:(184)    n-os          jankwa-ni:-wa
         obl-ART.n.p say-PRC-NMZ
         ‘when I said …’The status of these words will be discussed in more detail in 8.5.2.","[130, 131, 132, 133, 134]"

            {EA 13, 317b sp}In (38)a, a case of argument incorporation, the incorporated nominal element -cho is a
truncation of the noun mo’incho ‘chivé’ and represents the undergoer of the event. Due to the
incorporation of this element, the verb becomes monovalent, which can be seen from the fact
that the first-person actor is encoded by a pronoun of Set 2 (in), and that the NP referring to
the undergoer is oblique. In (38)b, in contrast, the incorporated element does not represent the
undergoer itself, but the inside part of the undergoer participant, with respect to which the
action is carried out. Despite the incorporation, the verb remains bivalent: the first-person
actor is represented by a pronoun of Set 1 (i ) and the undergoer is represented by an
unmarked NP.
   Thus, the main formal criterion for distinguishing modifying from argument incorporation
is that when the verb contains the direct voice marker, but is nevertheless monovalent, this is
argument incorporation. Furthermore, a verb with an incorporated modifier does not
necessarily contain the direct voice marker. Rather, it can, in principle, undergo all voice
modifications, described in section 9.2.1.
   The subsequent sections describe the types of modifying incorporation that could be
identified so far. The most productive process is incorporation of body-part terms (cf. 9.2.2).
Some bound elements, which only occur as incorporated modifiers, can also be identified as
part-of-whole terms (cf. 9.2.3). Elements denoting the Ground (location or goal) with respect
to which an event takes place are also productively incorporated (cf. 9.2.4 below); here,
incorporation is always accompanied by the suffixation of the applicative marker -e ,
described in 9.8.3 below. The incorporation of an element indicating an “instrument”, i.e., an
entitiy which is involved in, but not affected by, the event, is not very productive. The few
cases which can be characterized in this way are shown in 9.2.5. Another type of modifying
incorporation can be seen as “classificatory” (cf. 9.2.6): here, a classificatory bound element
is incorporated which can also be incorporated as an argument; however, the verb does not
undergo valency reduction. After this outline of the five basic semantic types identified so far,
I briefly discuss cases in which two synonymous elements are used according to the type of
incorporation (cf. 9.2.7); cases in which more than one modifying element is incorporated (cf.
9.2.8); bases which obligatorily take an incorporated element (cf. 9.2.9). The problem of
lexicalization will be addressed briefly in 9.2.10.
   Note, finally, that many elements which I analyse as incorporated modifiers in this grammar
cannot as yet be assigned a particular morphological class, and it is even difficult to identify
their meaning. I analyse them as incorporated nominal elements because, unlike grammatical
suffixes, they are not very productive, and unlike incorporated arguments, they modify the
meaning of the verb without influencing its valency, and are not found as independent nouns.
In this section, however, I will concentrate on the more transparent cases.","[400, 401]"

        ‘And the grinding basin, this big was its breadth.’                  {BA, TX 100}9.7.4. - e on bases containing an incorporated modifier
In a few cases, - e is found after an incorporated modifier. In the following words, this is the
bound nominal element -pa, which I assume to be the truncated form of cho:pa ‘my hand’ (cf.
5.3.3):(186)   a. ten-a-pa-n- e                      b. tem-pa-n- e
           ?-DR-TRC.hand-LN-CO                   ?-TRC.hand-LN-CO
           ‘I can do X.’                         ‘[It] can be done.’(187)   ruj-a-pa-n- e
        bad-DR-TRC.hand-LN-CO
        ‘I hinder X (to do something).’Here, the function of the suffix - e cannot be determined.
  The other cases in which - e occurs after an incorporated modifier concern words which
contain the incorporated noun root kwa ‘mouth’:(188)   chok-a-kwa-n- e          ‘I cover X (so that it is invisible).’
        pok-a-kwa-n- e           ‘I cover X (in a vessel).’
        bat-a-kwa-n- e           ‘I put X on top of something.’
        vik-a-kwa-n- e           ‘I put X diagonally on top of something.’
                                                                                            409
The suffix - e clearly has an applicative function here, in that it reassigns the semantic role of
the absolutive argument. This can be seen in (189)a–c. In (189)a, where the verb lacks the
suffix - e, the absolutive argument denotes the vessel, and the incorporated noun root
indicates that the vessel is affected with respect to its opening (part-of-whole modifying
incorporation, cf. 9.2.2, 9.2.3). In (189)b, the attachment of - e allows a new participant to be
encoded as the absolutive argument. This construction follows the pattern described in 9.7.2
above for simple bivalent roots (cf. (172)–(174)). In (189)c, it is shown that the absolutive
argument of this verb cannot encode the same participant as in the unmarked form, (189)a.(189)   a. loy i         pok-a:-kwa           as wu’tu
           ITN 1         close-DR-BR.mouth ART.n pan
           ‘I’ll cover the pan (with a lid).’        b. loy i         pok-a-kwa-n- e          is     lo:kwa
           ITN 1         close-DR-BR.mouth-LN-CO ART.pl locro
           ‘I’ll cover the (pan with) locro.’        c. * loy i       pok-a-kwa-n- e          as    wu’tu
             ITN 1       close-DR-BR.mouth-LN-CO ART.n pan                     {JM 16, 180}However, an alternative analysis is also possible, which regards the element - e as belonging
to the incorporated nominal element. It is based on the fact that the word kwan e can also
occur independently with the meaning “surface, top of something”. Here, the basic function of
the element - e is to indicate that there is a particular possessor which is not the natural
possessor in the part-of-whole relation (cf. 6.4.2). An illustration is given in (190).(190)   ban-na=sne        n-as        kwa-n- e=is                     mo’incho:-bun
        put-DR=f.a        obl-ART.n mouth-LN-CO=ART.pl                chivé-BR.mass
        ‘She put (it) [a cover] on top of the chivé mass.’                  {EA, Tuncho 007}Thus, it is possible that in the verbs in (188) and (189), the entire complex noun kwan e is
incorporated into the verb, and that the scope of the suffix - e is not over the entire verb.
Under this analysis, the structure of the verb pokakwan e ‘cover something inside a container’
would be as follows:(191)   pok-a-[kwa-n- e]
        close-DR-[mouth-LN-CO]
        ‘I cover X (with respect to the opening of its container).’In conclusion, the suffix - e is most productively attached to verb roots and to bases that
contain an incorporated modifier (cf. 9.7.1). The cases in which it is attached to a verb with an
incorporated modifier are marginal and may be the result of a different morphological
process.","[431, 432, 433]"

7.3.1. Argument representation by a free form in post-predicate position
As was shown in 7.2 above, in contrast to the representation of ARG1, the overt representation
of the absolutive argument is not obligatory, and an absolutive bound pronoun is phonetically
less closely attached to the predicate. The absolutive argument can also be represented by a
free pronoun in post-predicate position, instead of a bound pronoun or an NP. This is shown
in (19) for an intransitive and in (20) for a transitive clause:(19)      joy-ka -a=us141 po:ra,      din-ka:-ye                           usko
          go-IM-LV=m.a briefly hard-MLT-BE.person                          PRO.m.a
          ‘He went at once, he was in a hurry.’                                            {EG, Sicurí 044}(20)      yo’-na=is       jema’ che joy-a- e=is     usko
          catch-DR=pl.a also      and go-DR-CO=pl.a PRO.m.a
          ‘They caught [him] too, and carried him.’                                     {EA, Aros II 027}In both (19) and (20), the free pronoun replaces the bound pronoun (which would be --us).
Example (21) shows post-predicate encoding of the absolutive argument in an intransitive
clause by the free pronoun in addition to the bound pronoun, a construction which can be
described as right-dislocation:(21)      jayna      jo’yaj--us usko
          DSC        arrive--m.a PRO.m.a
          ‘So he arrived.’                                                              {EA, Cbba 182}In (22), right-dislocation of the absolutive argument of a transitive clause (ARG2) is shown.
The pause before the NP (indicated by a comma) shows that this is a case of “afterthought
topicalization” (Givón 2001: 267).(22)      joy-a-kwa=is        u’ko,    us                   Hernan
          go-DR-BEN=pl.a PRO.m ART.m                        Hernan
          ‘They went for him, for Hernan.’                                                 {EA, Aros 024}ARG1 is only rarely represented by an additional element after the predicate. Examples of this
are (23) and (24). Note that in (24), the speaker uses the free pronoun to show that she is
correcting herself (“it was him who sold it, not her”).(23)      ji:sa-na-kwa-na=u         u’ko               ni-kis       ka:pe=‘ne
          make-DR-BEN-DR=m PRO.m                       obl-ART.pl.a coffee=f
          ‘He has made coffee for her.’142                                                 {EA 14, 061a}
141
    The suffix -ka ‘IM’ triggers internal cliticization of the argument, even though the verb is monovalent; cf.
10.1.1.
142
    The translation was checked several times. Still, it is not clear to me why this sentence does not mean “He has
made her coffee for him.” Possibly, this has to do with the most straightforward meaning implied by the
possessive pronoun =‘ne ‘f’.","[285, 286]"

The table shows that singular forms are differentiated for gender (masculine, feminine,
neuter), while there is only one form expressing plural. The categories are encoded by specific
morphemes, which were already mentioned in 4.5 above:       masculine singular: /u/
       feminine singular: /i/ and /n/
       neuter singular:    /a/ or /o/
       plural/mass:        /i/In 4.7.1 and 4.7.2 I describe the categories gender and number, respectively, with regard to all
these markers, including demonstratives. In 4.8, I describe the pragmatic categories encoded
by the personal pronouns and the article, leaving the description of the demonstratives for 4.9
below.",[170]

3.7.11. Emphasis
As may be expected of this process, reduplication can also be used to mark emphasis.
However, according to my data so far, this does not seem to be very productive in Movima.
The following are examples:

(114)     paluy~pa:luy
          RED~cold
          ‘very cold’                                                                {EC 16, 295}(115)     dewa~dewaj-na45
          EMPH~see-DR
          ‘I see it well.’                                                        {EC 16, 297}(116)     kas ona~’ona-ka’-ra:-na
          NEG EMPH~know-IRR-BE.ntr-DR
          ‘I know absolutely nothing.’                                            {EC 16, 104b}Emphatic reduplication seems to be most productive in combination with the irrealis infix
<a’> (cf. 3.6.2), as in (116) above. Interestingly, it seems to be the case that on verbs with
disyllabic roots (such as ona- in (116)), the reduplication occurs after the infixation process,
while on verbs with monosyllabic roots (such as sal- in (117) below), the reduplication also
involves the irrealis marker. Consider the simple irrealis verb in (117)a and the reduplicated
form in (117)b:(117)     a. kas sal-a’-na                b. kas sala’~sala’-na
             NEG search-IRR-DR               NEG RED~search:IRR-DR
             ‘I don’t look for anything.’    ‘I look for absolutely nothing.’ {EC16, 107}One of the problems to be investigated here is whether emphatic reduplication is an instance
of bimoraic or of foot reduplication. In (115), it is clearly the first bimoraic segment which is
reduplicated (in contrast to (111) above), whereas in (116) and in (117), where the irrealis
marker is included, it is the first iambic foot.","[117, 118]"

bivalent verbs. They have the same structure as (120)b above:(124)   in a      kwey us-na     n-os        ju:ve

        ‘And the barbed wire, that held her back then, caught her dress.’ {EA, Escape 062}The following example shows that in this way, the undergoer in the inverse construction can
be encoded by a clause-initial free pronoun as well:(127)   isko      kaw jiram-poj-kay         n-os         rey je’        in a

        ‘They liked the way I was.’ [lit. “The way I was pleased them].” {HR, TX 048}Like any oblique argument, the oblique-marked former ARG2 can be left out. This is the case
in the following examples:(128)   en-che --iy’bi ja’ che in a              kwey   man-na
        stand-R/R--2pl just and PRO.1sg FOC             shoot-DR

            ‘Because just that healed (it), that toad.’                 {ER, Sapo 021}It is important to note that in the absence of kaw, a bivalent predicate that is not combined
with an internally cliticized referential element would be interpreted as having a first person
singular ARG1 (cf. 7.4). Consider the difference between (131)a and b. In (131)a, the bivalent
predicate implies the first person ARG1, so that the person encoded by the free pronoun is
automatically interpreted as ARG2 (in this case, the undergoer). The clause in (131)b differs
from (131)a in that it contains the particle kwey, which decreases the valency of the predicate.
As a result, the free pronoun is ARGintr, and therefore interpreted as the actor in the described
event.(131)       a. ulkwan kay-a:-poj        b. ulkwan kwey           kay-a:-poj

7.9. Nonverbal predicates and predicateless clauses
I will now turn to intransitive clauses whose predicate is not a verb or which lack a predicate
altogether. While a predicate typically is a verb, it can also be a noun, a demonstrative, or an
oblique NP. Movima does not have a copula. Clauses with a nonverbal predicate are
equational, existential/locational, and possessive clauses, and they are always intransitive. The
core argument of such a clause is expressed in the same way as in intransitive clauses with
verbal predicates (cf. 7.2). Furthermore, there are clauses which lack a predicate altogether.
  I will first describe predicate nominals (7.9.1), then predicateless clauses (7.9.2), and then
turn to predicates consisting of an oblique noun phrase (7.9.3) or of a demonstrative (7.9.4).
Section 7.9.5 describes different types of possessive clauses, which include clauses with
demonstrative predicates, predicative oblique noun phrases, and a special type of predicate
nominal formed by foot reduplication.","[310, 311, 312]"
"                                                                                                              155
The impression gained during elicitation is that the presential forms of the articles and
pronouns are used for referents within calling distance.77 For example, a person in the same
house or compound as the speaker, is referred to by a presential referential element, even
though s/he may be invisible or not near the speech situation. This was the case with the
following utterance:(86)        in    bele:ka bo      jo’yaj us      majni      di’ as-kwa=as Tirinra
            1intr happy REAS arrive ART.m my_child REL sit-?=ART.n Trinidad
            ‘I’m happy because my son has arrived, the one who lives in Trinidad.’
            {EA, Antes de fiesta 002}In contrast, the absential forms are generally used for referents which are perceived as
inaccessible, i.e. in the case of concrete, animate referents, outside calling distance:(87)        loy i sal-na               kinos      dichi:ye bo kas kino’-ni:-wa

            ‘My father is alive, but he is in another village.’           {HR, TX 185f.}The following example shows that being in the same village is not sufficient for using the
presential referential element: here, the absential referential elements are used even in
combination with the demonstrative adverb ney ‘here’.(89)        kinos   ma’            kino’ ite’ni, kino’ ney n-as       ja’ lo:los
            ART.f.a my_mother DM.f.a alive DM.f.a here obl-ART.n just village
            ‘My mother is alive, she is right here in the village.’ {HR, TX 189}The presential forms are always used for what can be labelled “absolute concepts”. These
include spatial categories which do not need to be specified by context, as in (90)−(92) (and
the phrase n-as son-lo:los in (88) above):(90)        ka’de as     Kochawamba, a’ko ona-waj-na
            until ART.n Cochabamba PRO.n know-BE.place-DR
            ‘Just Cochabamba, that (place) I know.’                                   {EA, Cbba 232}
77
     For inanimate referents, however, the presential forms are generally used only when the referent is located in
sight of the speaker. Thus, a referent higher in the animacy hierarchy is perceived as present more easily than a
referent low on the hierarchy. More detailed research is needed to confirm this.","[178, 179]"

While all predicate nominals can be reduplicated in order to function as the predicate of a
negative or subordinate clause, the suffix - e has a more limited distribution. First of all, the
form with - e occurs more often in negative than in subordinate clauses. The following
example illustrates this. In (16)a, the adjective tochi’ ‘small’ occurs in a negative clause with
the suffix - e. In (16)b, it is shown that in a subordinate clause, this suffix cannot be used.
Rather, the reduplicated form has to be used, as shown by (16)c (cf. also (8) above).(16)    a. kas     tochi'- e

prototypical nouns are only rarely found with this suffix (cf. 3.10.4.3). The only text example
of a noun with the suffix - e in a negative clause is given in (17):(17)    jayna kas        don-’i- e=os       chi:~chi
        DSC NEG blood-D-NMZ.N=n.p MD~go_out
        ‘It wasn’t blood anymore what came out.’                                   {EA, Cbba 159}The reason why in (17), the predicate nominal don’i ‘blood’ is marked by - e and not by
reduplication, may be that when reduplicated, the word would be homophonous with the
inalienably possessed form. Recall from 3.7.5 and 6.4.1 that like action nominalization,
inalienable possession is marked by infixing reduplication. This is illustrated in (18) for the
same word as in (17) above. The sentence in (18) is the one which follows (17) in the
narration.(18)    ba:-ra          jayna     os         don-<‘i:~>‘i        jayna
        finish-BE.ntr DSC         ART.n.p blood-<INAL~>D DSC
        ‘I had lost all my blood.’ [lit: “My blood was finished.”] {EA, Cbba 160}In this particular context, it is possible that the suffix - e is used in (17) in order to distinguish
the negated predicate nominal from the inalienably possessed noun in (18). However, it can
still be concluded that adjectives are more often combined with the suffix - e than nouns,
especially in negative clauses, so that the tendency to use - e on adjectives can be seen as a
distinction between the two word classes.
   Before concluding the present section, I will briefly discuss verbs that contain the ending
-wa, but where this element does not have a nominalizing function. Examples include                                                                                                 471

        ‘When there are many people when theyi go out [onto the stage], theyi are ashamed.’
        {EA, Tolkosya I 028}When these verbs are nominalized, the nominalizing suffix -wa is attached. This shows that
-wa in (19) and (20) above is not the nominalizing suffix, but part of the verbal base.(21)    n-as       tivijniwa-wa=i
        obl-ART.n feel_pain-NMZ=pl
        ‘when they have pain’                                   {AH, EA&AH 023}(22)    kas     chajaniwa:-wa         n-in a       n-as     je’e

        ‘I am not ashamed of myself, of how I am.’         {HR, TX 088}While the verb chajaniwa ‘be ashamed’ (cf. (20)) always occurs with the ending -wa, there is
also a verb tivijni ‘hurt’, derived from the noun ti:vij ‘pain’, which does not contain the
ending -wa. Here, a difference in meaning can be observed: the argument of the verb tivijni
‘hurt’ expresses the body part which hurts, whereas the argument of the verb tivijni:wa ‘feel
pain’ expresses the person or animal that feels pain. Compare (24) below, which contains the
nominalized form of the verb tivijni ‘hurt’, with (19) above, which contains the verb tivijni:wa
‘feel pain’. Apart from the difference in meaning, ‘hurt’ versus ‘feel pain’, the form in (24) is
a relational noun, while the one in (19) above is a monovalent verb.(23)    tivij-ni    as    bari=‘ne

        ‘That was when her toe hurt.’                          {EA, Lagartija 021}  Thus, there is a suffix -wa, homophonous with the nominalizer, which has an applicative
function, raising a new participant to argument function. However, this suffix does not seem
to be productive, since only these two examples were found.","[493, 494, 495]"

cases, the possessor of the affected entity is encoded as ARG2. The example contains a
sequence of five transitive clauses. The predicate of the first clause is a simple bivalent verb
( ap-u’-na ‘I wash X well’), followed by three bivalent verbs with an incorporated modifier.
The predicate of the last clause is a verb with an incorporated argument and the applicative
suffix -e .(198)   ba:-ra           ap-u’-na,       wichi’-ka-ben-na,                 jawo-bakwa:-na,

‘CO’ described in 9.7 above. These suffixes are similar in that they both have and applicative
function and can be attached to verbs containing an incorporated argument. However, there is
a crucial difference. First of all, observe the different structures of bases containing these
suffixes, represented in (199):(199)   a. VR + -a + incorporated argument + -e        (described here)
        b. VR + -a + incorporated argument + - e + -na (cf. 9.7.1 above, (164)–(166))The two structures are illustrated in (200) and (201). In (200), which corresponds to the
pattern in (199)a, the verbal base is put in square brackets in order to illustrate the point that
will be discussed below.(200)   [loj-a-’oj]- e:-na              kino alra

        ‘I’ll wash my husband’s clothes.’                                    {EA 14, 132}In both constructions, a monovalent base that contain an incorporated argument undergoes a
valency increase. However, the suffix - e ‘CO’ is attached to a complex verb with an
incorporated argument in the same way as to any other monovalent base, as indicated by the
square brackets in (200). The direct marker -na is then added to create a semantically bivalent
verb, so that the newly introduced co-participant can be encoded as ARG2. The suffix -e
‘APPL’, in contrast, does not take an additional bivalent voice marker. Rather, it demotes the
grammatical function of the incorporated element from that of an argument to that of a
modifier (cf. 9.2 above). Therefore, on the resulting verb, it is the original bivalent voice
marker, obligatory for argument incorporation, that marks the verb as semantically bivalent.
However, note that here, this marker cannot be dropped to create a monovalent verb,
something which is possible with modifier incorporation.","[435, 436]"

4.8.2.1. The marking of ceased vs. ongoing existence with concrete referents
The basic property of the existence-marking functions of the article is to indicate the existence
or non-existence of the referent at the time of speaking. This can be seen in the following pair
of examples:(107)   a. la’     in     jo’yaj     n-as         as-na
           ANT 1intr      arrive obl-ART.n sit-DR
           ‘Some time ago I arrived at home (where I am now).’        b. la’     in   jo’yaj     n-os           as-na

           ‘Some time ago I arrived at home (which doesn’t exist anymore).’ {EM 13, 199}Examples (108)−(110) show that the marking of ceased existence is independent from the
temporal context. In (108), the presential pronoun a’ko indicates a non-past context; in (109),
the non-past context is indicated by the absential demonstrative koro’ and by the absential
article kos; in (110), it is indicated by the noun phrase nas tino:na’. In all three examples, the
function of the past article is to indicate that the referent is not in existence at the time of
speaking.(108)   a’ko       rey   a a-<kwa~>kwa=os                     do’we

                                                                                              161

            ‘But my granddaughter took the egg.’                                 {EA, Huevo 007}Here, the past article os in os jo kwa ‘the egg’ indicates that the egg is not in existence
anymore, the implication being that the child has eaten it up.81 In contrast, note that the child,
i’nes ona:cho ‘my granddaughter’, is referred to by the presential article, since she is in
existence and present at the moment of speaking.
  Example (112) illustrates the use of the past article in a future context (indicated by the
particle loy). The past article in os no:no indicates that the referent has ceased to exist at the
time of speaking.(112)       aj<a>lo:maj loy os                no:no di’ pa:ko

            ‘I’ll tell you about my (former, deceased) pet dog.’ {JM Perro I,001}Likewise, existing entities are generally referred to by a non-past (i.e., presential or absential)
referential element even in past-tense contexts (indicated in the following examples by the
past article).(113)       n-os         ayloba-wa=y’ i       nosde: n-as kole:jiyo

            ‘That’s why she has bought those [shoes].’                         {EA, Basket 012}Here, the presential or absential form is applied according to the criteria described in 4.8.1
above. This means that in principle, neither absolute concepts (such as those encoded by
kole:jiyo in (113) or Peru in (114)), nor referents which are present at the speech situation
(such as the speaker’s daughter in (114) and (115) or the shoes in (115)), can be referred to by
a past article, even in past-tense contexts.
  Note that the basic condition for the application of the past article is that the referent must
have ceased to exist, as in (108)–(112) above. Entities which have simply lost their function
or identity (of the type that can be referred to in English by the prefix ex-), are not
automatically referred to by the past article in Movima, but according to their physical
81
     This was confirmed by other speakers when asked about this sentence.","[184, 185]"

3.9.1. Internal cliticization
Internal cliticization marks the first transitive argument (ARG1) of a predicate and the
possessor of a noun phrase. The defining characteristics of internal cliticization are as follows:    Internal clitics
    1. participate in word stress
    2. lead to shortening of a prosodically lengthened vowel
    3. require a preceding vowel, which may not be longIn the following paragraphs, I will describe these points in detail. After that, I will discuss
some other, more marginal prosodic conditions of internal clitics.
  As to 1., when the clitic is syllabic, stress shifts one position to the right, so that it occurs on
the penultimate syllable of the entire word form. This can be seen in (121)c, as opposed to
(121)a, where there is no clitic, and to (121)b, where there is a non-syllabic internal clitic. The
phonetic representation is given in each example, with the stressed syllable in bold-face:
                                                                                                    97
(121)   a. dewajna                b. dewajna=n               c. dewajna=us
           see:DR                    see:DR=2                   see:DR=m
           [ 'wahna]                 [ 'wahnan]                 [ wah'na us]
           ‘I see X.’                ‘You see X.’               ‘He sees X.’Disyllabic internal clitics usually do not carry stress, so that stress remains on the last syllable
of the base, even though this is not the penultimate syllable of the word form. This is
illustrated in (122):(122)   n-os          asna=kinos ay’ku
        obl-ART.n.p home=ART.f.a aunt
        [… as'nakinos ' aj ku]
        ‘in my aunt’s house’                                              {EA, Ay’ku I 006}Occasionally, however, an internal clitic is stressed when an external clitic follows. This is
shown in 3.9.2.
   The rule in 2. implies that when the penultimate syllable of the host is long due to prosodic
lengthening, (cf. 2.8.2), internal cliticization leads to shortening of that syllable. This is
independent of the syllabicity of the clitic itself: even the non-syllabic internal clitic =n
triggers vowel shortening. Consider the verb forms containing a clitic in (123)b and c in
contrast to the unmarked verb in (123)a:(123)   a. onara:na   [ na' a:na]               ‘I know X.’        (know:BE.ntr:DR)
        b. onarana=n [ na' anan]                ‘You know X.’      (know:BE.ntr:DR=2)
        c. onarana=us [ na a'na us]             ‘He knows X.’      (know:BE.ntr:DR=m.a)Exceptions occur when the penultimate syllable of the host is long not for prosodic, but for
lexical reasons (cf. 2.9.2). This vowel remains long also before an internal clitic. Example
(124) shows the case of a verb whose root consists of a long open syllable, and (125) that of a
loan (recall from 2.9.2 that disyllabic loans of the structure CVCV always have a long first
syllable). As can be seen, the vowel remains long even though an internal clitic is attached.(124)   ju:-na=us
        scold-DR=m.a
        [hu:'na us]
        ‘He scolds X.’(125)   wa:ka=us
        cow=m.a
        [wa:'ka us]
        ‘his cow’The third defining property of internal clitics is that they can only be attached to a vowel.
When the base ends in a consonant, as in (126), the linking vowel -a is attached so that it can98
serve as a host for an internal clitic. This vowel also participates in the stress rule, i.e., when
the clitic is mono- or disyllabic, this vowel receives stress.(126)   alwaj-a=us
        spouse-LV=m.a
        [ alwa'ha us]
        ‘His wife’Since they always follow a vowel, vowel-initial internal clitics are always preceded by the
hiatus-resolving glottal stop. This could be seen in the phonetic transcriptions of the above
examples, e.g. (123)c and (126).
  While their participation in the stress pattern makes internal cliticization suffix-like, there
are some differences to suffixation (cf. 2.9.1). First of all, the vowel to which the internal
clitic is attached is always short. Normally, the penultimate open syllable of a word is long
(cf. 2.8.2). Consider the last vowel of the base dewajna in (127)a, where an enclitic is
attached, and in (127)b, where a suffix is attached:(127)   a. dewaj-na=us                   b. n-os       dewaj-na:-wa
           see-DR=m.a                       obl-ART.p see-DR-NMZ
           ‘He sees X.’                     ‘when I saw X’Another difference between internal cliticization and suffixation concerns the occurrence of
the linking nasal. As was shown in 2.9.3, certain base endings are followed by a nasal before
a suffix is added. However, this is not the case when an internal clitic is attached. Consider
the example of /kwa/ in (128). This ending is usually followed by a nasal when a suffix is
attached, as shown by (128)a. In contrast, an internal clitic is attached directly to the base, as
in (128)b.(128)   a. si -kwa-n-ti’                   b. si -kwa=us
           BR.hole-ABS-LN-VBZ                 BR.hole-ABS=m.a
           ‘to dig a hole’                    ‘his hole, his well’There are still more prosodic conditions for the attachment of an internal clitic, depending on
the kind of base it is attached to. When the base is a bound noun root with only two moras, it
has to be morphologically augmented. On a consonant-final base, this condition is
automatically met by the attachment of the linking vowel, as in (129) and (130). When the
consonant-final root is monosyllabic, as in (130), the attachment of the linking vowel triggers
vowel lengthening (cf. 2.9.2, examples (215) and (216)). In this way, the requirement of three
moras is met as well:(129)   tolej-a=as
        BR.branch-LV=n.a
        ‘its branch’
                                                                                                99
(130)   e: -a=n
        BR.name-LV=2
        ‘your name’When, however, the bound root ends in a vowel, so that no linking vowel is added, it is
augmented by reduplication. A root of the structure CVCV undergoes infixing reduplication,
as shown in (131). A monosyllabic root is reduplicated twice, first undergoing prefixing and
then, presumably, infixing reduplication, as in (132) (cf. also 3.7.9 above):(131)   lo<we~>we=as
        BR.colour<RED~>=n.a
        ‘its colour’(132)   ba~<ba~>ba=as
        RED~BR.round<RED~>=n.a
        ‘its fruit’Note that this only concerns bound roots (cf. 5.3.2), not roots which can function as
independent nouns. Due to the shortening of a prosodically long vowel described above, a
disyllabic independent nominal base is generally bimoraic after an internal clitic has been
added, unless it is a loan or has a monosyllabic root (cf. (124) and (125) above):(133)   a. ro:ya                 b.     roya=n
           house                        house=2
           ‘house’                      ‘your house’Further examples of the augmentation of bound roots are given in 5.3.2.
  Up to now, I only described cases involving internally cliticized bound pronouns. However,
noun phrases, whose initial element is an article or a demonstrative determiner (cf. 4.4), can
be attached in the same way. Example (134) below shows this for an NP encoding ARG1 of a
transitive clause (cf. 7.2), and (135) for an NP encoding the possessor of a noun (cf. 6.1). In
both cases, the encliticized element is an article.(134)   ona-ra-na=us                  itila:kwa
        know-BE.ntr-DR=ART.m          man

        ‘the husband of her daughter’                                {EA,Neighbours 011}The following example shows cliticization of a possessive noun phrase containing a
demonstrative. Note that the determining =s is attached to the demonstrative by neutral
cliticization (cf. 3.9.3):

         ‘the husband of that (standing) young woman’                  {EA, Neighbours 017}As was said above, the most important function of internal cliticization is to indicate that the
cliticized constituent represents ARG1 of a transitive clause or the possessor of an NP. This is
the crucial difference to external cliticization, described in the following section, which is
only used to mark the absolutive argument of a clause.","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124]"
"                                                                                                         167
4.8.2.4. Immediate past
The absential article also has the potential of indicating a temporal category. This is the case
when it refers to times or events, i.e. when it cooccurs with a temporal or action nominal (cf.
4.8.2.2). An absential marker referring to this type of concept indicates that the time or event
occurred in the “immediate past”, which is the time range from the night before the day of
speaking until the moment of speaking (cf. (99)).
  Examples (136)a–b illustrate the distinction between past, immediate past, and non-past
made by the article when combined with an action nominal (ji:sana:wa). The sentences only
differ in the form of the article. The speaker’s comments are given in square brackets.(136)   a. jayna in     ba:-lo:maj     n-os           ji:sa-na:-wa a cha’di
           then 1intr finish-BE.time obl-ART.n.p make-DR-NMZ ART.n.1 fence
           ‘I’ve already finished making my fence.’ [long ago]        b. jayna in      ba:-lomaj      no-kos         ji:sa-na:-wa a cha’di
           then 1intr finish-BE.time obl-ART.n.a make-DR-NMZ ART.n.1 fence
           ‘I just finished making my fence.’ [this very moment]        c. jayna in      ba:-lomaj      n-as             ji:sa-na:-wa a         cha’di
           then 1intr finish-BE.time obl-ART.n make-DR-NMZ ART.n.1 fence
           ‘I’ll finish making my fence.’ [I’m still building it]      {EA 13, 250a}As can be seen from the translation and the comment, the absential article kos in (136)b
indicates that the event has been concluded, but not as long ago as in (136)a, which contains
the past article os. In contrast to these two examples, the presential article as also clearly
implies a temporal category, which is after the moment of speaking (cf. (136)).
  The line between the application of the past and the absential article in combination with an
action or temporal nominal is quite clear: the past article is used when the time or event
referred to occured before the day of speaking, and the absential article is used when it
occurred on the same day. This is illustrated by the following excerpts from a text whose time
range covers the previous afternoon (cf. (137)) and the day of speaking, including events not
long before and after the moment of speaking (cf. (138) and (139), respectively).","[190, 191]"

aspiration (cf. 2.6). Since the phoneme / /of the proclitic marker (i) is often realized as [h] as
well (cf. ibid.), the first person singular of Set 1 is often encoded practically in the same way
as the second person singular of Set 2: both are realized as [h]. Consider the pronunciation of
the first-person marker of Set 1 (ARG1) in (8) and the second-person marker of Set 2 (the
absolutive argument) in (9):(8)     loy        i ken<a:>pa         us        Roman
        ITN        1 inform<DR>        ART.m     Roman

        ‘I’ll tell Roman.’                                        {EA, Cbba 146}(9)     jayna      rey   ij    das-a:-mo

        [... ih a'sa:m ]
        ‘Then again you mow.’                                   {EA, Chaco II 040}Normally, however, no ambiguities arise from this homophony, since there are very few verbs
which can be either monovalent or bivalent. The verb in (8) is bivalent, so that the pronoun
can only be interpreted as the first person ARG1, and the verb in (9) is monovalent (due to
argument incorporation, cf. 7.7 and 9.1), so that the bound pronoun pronounced as /h/ can
only be a marker of second person.
  Another problem is that the first person singular of Set 1 and the first person inclusive of
Set 2 are marked identically, by the proclitic (i) . Since the absolutive argument (Set 2) is not
obligatorily expressed (cf. 7.2), a transitive clause with a first person singular ARG1 and an
intransitive clause with the first person inclusive absolutive argument have the same structure:(10)    i tikoy-na
        1 kill-DR
        ‘I kill X.’(11)    i    joy-che
        1     go-R/R
        ‘We left.’All persons being quite clearly distinguished, how can it be explained that these two persons
are encoded by homophonous pronouns? The reason can perhaps be found when the encoding
of the absolutive argument (ARG2) in transitive clauses is taken into account. As is shown in
7.4 and 7.5, neither the first nor the second person singular pronoun can be encoded as ARG2.
Therefore, when ARG1 represents the first person and ARG2 the second person, the second
person is not overtly encoded at all, but implied. This is illustrated in (12):(12)    loy       i     sal-na
        ITN       1     search-DR
        ‘I will look for you.’
        (other possible reading, depending on the context: ‘I will look for it/her/him/them.’)                                                                                              135
The conclusion to be drawn from this is that when the verb is bivalent and the context is
appropriate, a bivalent predicate with the first person as ARG1 has by default the second
person singular as ARG2. This means that, in a sense, the proclitic marker (i) , if not
disambiguated by an enclitic, by default encompasses both the first and the second person.
Therefore, with regard to a monovalent verb (cf. (11)), there is only one possible
interpretation when this pronoun appears. This is the inclusive reading: “I do X with you”.
  Thus, the distinction between the categories of speech-act participants in the system of
bound pronouns is not very clear-cut. When two homophonous markers belong to different
paradigms, as in the case of (i) described above, it is the valency of the verb which
determines which person is involved. When they belong to the same paradigm, as is the case
with the intransitive second-person singular marker (i)j and the intransitive inclusive marker
when pronounced as [h], disambiguation can only be provided by the context.
    Finally, it has to be pointed out that only the enclitics of Set 1 are grammatically
obligatory, whereas the proclitics and the enclitics of Set 2 are not. More details on this are
found in 6.2 and 7.2.","[157, 158, 159]"

A clause can also consist of the juxtaposition of a free pronoun and an oblique constituent (cf.
7.6). The oblique constituent (bold) functions here as an ascriptive predicate. Consider the
following examples:(150)   os         neychi-mo:-n-e               di’ aro:so, asko       n-as       ele:siya

        ‘They (were) from over there, from Sécure.’                      {GC, Marcha 024}The predicative function of the oblique NP results from its juxtaposition with a free pronoun,
similar to the constructions described in 7.9.2 above.
  Juxtaposition of a pronoun with an oblique NP is very frequent when the oblique NP
contains an action noun (cf. 11.1). This usually creates time adverbials:(153)   che asko        n-os          jiwa:-wa

I will now turn to clauses whose predicates consist of demonstratives (demonstrative
predicates). These can be characterized as being prototypically existential. In (156) and (157),
this is illustrated with an absential and a past demonstrative, respectively:(156)   koro’        kos      si:doj    di’ a:mon no-ko      bay im

        ‘There are (= I can hear) the chickens here where I sleep, I said.’ {EA, Gallina 016}Like all other clause types, a clause headed by a demonstrative predicate can also contain a
free pronoun in topic position. This is shown by (161):(160)   i’ne        kine’e
        PRO.f       DM.f.std
        ‘It’s her.’                                                {EA, Neighbours 008}(161)   i’ko,     jankwa=‘ne, i’ko         kila’wa

                                                                                            295
7.9.5. Possessive clauses
I will now turn to possessive clauses. There are three ways of forming a possessive clause in
Movima: two in which the possessum is indefinite (“I have an X”) and one in which the
possessum is definite (“X is mine”). I will refer to these types as “indefinite” and “definite”
possessive clauses, respectively (cf. Stassen 2001).
  Indefinite possessive clauses are either formed by a demonstrative predicate or by a noun
containing iambic foot reduplication. As in existential clauses (cf. 7.9.4), demonstrative
predicates in possessive clauses consist of the absential or past demonstrative. The difference
with existential clauses is that the NP is marked as possessed (cf. 6.1). The possessive relation
encoded in this way is usually alienable. Consider the following examples:(162)    jema’     koro’     kos        cha’pa=sne                        jema’a
         also      DM.a.n ART.n.a walking_stick=f.a                       also

         ‘Our mother, she had a little machine, look.’             {EA, Makina 001}In the second type of indefinite possession, the noun denoting the possessum is a predicate
nominal which has undergone iambic foot reduplication (cf. 3.7.2).173(164)    in     do’~do’we-to:da

clause, the possessum is the predicate and the possessor is encoded as the argument.","[316, 317, 318, 319]"

Phonological cliticization of a bound pronoun representing ARG2 in a transitive clause can
best be seen when ARG1 is an enclitic from the paradigm of speech-act participants (cf. 7.4, ),
as in the following example. The phonemic representation shows that the bound pronoun is
‘pl.a’ is externally cliticized, the preceding consonant, / /, forming the syllable onset.(11)    bo         kas     kaj<a> e-wa=nkwe --is
        REAS       NEG come_up_to<DR>-NMZ=2pl--pl.a

        ‘Because you didn’t stop them!’                                  {EA, Dichiyeye 028}When ARG1 in the transitive clause is a third person, the cliticization of the bound pronoun of
ARG2 is not so easy to see. This is because the bound pronoun representing ARG2 is marked
as obviative by the element k- (cf. 7.5.2 below), so that it is always consonant-initial in this
environment. Therefore, the syllable structure does not change when a third-person bound
pronoun is attached.
  However, occasionally a third-person bound pronoun representing ARG2 participates in the
stress pattern, and this can be seen as a sign of phonological cliticization. Consider the
transitive clause in (12), in which the ARG2 pronoun does not participate in the stress pattern;
in (13), in contrast, which is an example from the same text, the ARG2 pronoun does
participate, so that stress falls on the bound pronoun representing ARG1. The stressed
syllables are given in bold print here.(12)    joy-che --us,   man-na=us--kas

in (14) below. Here, no evidence of cliticization can be provided.(14)    yo’-na      is        pa:ko    kas

in determiner function, i.e. with the cliticized determining element (cf. 4.4), usually the long

element (here, i:=s) would in some cases be phonologically similar to the presential article (is
‘ART.pl’). The short form of the speaker-oriented neuter demonstrative, in contrast, is often
found in article position, since it is sufficiently distinct from it. Here, it is interchangeable
with the long form:(159)       a. ay=s               do’we      ~               b. ayru=s       do’we

does not occur with any of the other referential elements, and further research is needed to
explain it.86 The following example illustrates it:(160)       jayna     ayru        ay    loy-’i

and entities that are within reach of either speaker or adressee (cf. (161) above and (164)

demonstratives do not require that the speaker actually looks at the referent (as shown by

7.2. The formal distinction of third-person core arguments
In this section, I describe the ways in which the core arguments of a verb are encoded, starting
out with third-person arguments. This includes argument encoding by cliticized elements and
by free elements, such as NPs, free pronouns, and demonstratives. The encoding of first and
second person arguments is described in 7.4, and the direct/inverse system is described in 7.5.
The details of voice and valency marking on the verb are described in Ch. 8.
  Third-person core arguments are distinguished by their phonological connection to the
predicate. An ARG1 pronoun or NP is attached as an internal clitic, i.e., it triggers stress shift
and requires a preceding vowel (cf. 3.9.1). Example (3) shows internal cliticization of the
article of a full noun phrase representing ARG1 (in bold print). The cliticization of a bound
pronoun representing ARG1 is shown in (4):(3)         che man<a>ye=is              pa:ko os         rulrul
            and meet<DR>=ART.pl          dog      ART.n.p jaguar
            ‘And the dogs encountered the/a jaguar.’                                {EA, Tigre y perro 003}(4)         jayna     yey-na=sne kos             fo:to=sne

            ‘Then she wanted her foto.’ [i.e., a photo taken of herself]                     {EA, Visita 108}The overt realization of ARG1 is grammatically obligatory.138 As an illustration, the following
example displays a sequence of several transitive clauses, in none of which the ARG1 is
dropped:(5)         jiwa- e-na=‘ne,      yo’-na=‘ne as         jo’me, jiwa- e-na=‘ne--ka’        ney

            ‘She brought it, she caught the chicken and brought it here.’ {EA Gallina 011f.}ARGintr and ARG2 have several encoding properties which distinguish them from ARG1.
Since they share these properties, they can be subsumed under the label “absolutive
argument”. Their distinctive properties can be described as follows.
  First of all, as is indicated by the brackets in (1), the overt realization of the absolutive
argument is not grammatically obligatory; it can be omitted when it can be retrieved from the
context. This is often the case in clause combinations. Consider the predicates in (6) (bold
print) which are not combined with an overt argument, since the argument (underlined) has
been established in the preceding clause:138
      The absence of an encliticized bound pronoun or NP implies that ARG1 is the first person singular (cf. 7.4).",[282]

reduplication: this indicates that its denotatum is inalienably possessed by the house. In (45)
and (46), finally, it receives the marker - e: this marks the noun as relational, too, but the
possessive relation is not an inalienable part-of-whole relation.(43)     po’-ti          as ra:da

         ‘I’ll glue the paper onto my door.’                        {EA 19, 251a}There is clearly a link between the suffix - e on a noun and its applicative function on a verb
(cf. 9.7). In both cases, it indicates that there is a “new” participant/possessor, which is less
closely related to the event/entity denoted by the base than the “normal” participant/possessor.
As an illustration, consider the following example of the marker - e on the verb root kel-
‘open’. The unmarked verb in (47)a takes a “normal” undergoer, a patient; the verb marked by
- e in (47)b takes an undergoer which is less directly affected by the event. This is similar to
the possessive relationship indicated by - e in (45) and (46) above, which is less direct than
the inalienable relationship in (44).(47)     a. loy i kel-na             as    ra:da

on some nouns, it can be replaced by the applicative suffix -e , without a change in meaning.(48)     a. a’ko         towa-n- e
            PRO.n 1 path-LN-CO

            ‘It is my path [i.e., the path I use].’                              {EA 12, 255e}240
Like - e, the suffix -e is found on verbs as well. However, on verbs, it is not an allomorph of
- e (cf. 9.8). Therefore, it is possible that - e/-e on nouns is a different morpheme with two
allomorphs. However, until this phenomenon has been investigated more thoroughly, I treat
- e and -e as two different morphemes, identical to the verbal suffixes.
  The applicative morphemes only occur on a restricted number of nouns, most of all on some
nouns denoting geographic entities and on some body-part terms. The resulting bases always
indicate that the entity has a particular function. I will discuss geographical entities (to which
I count concepts like ‘door’ as well) first, and will turn to body-part terms below in this
section.
  Possession of a geographic entity means that the entity is owned or regularly used by the
“possessor”. The following are some more examples, in addition to those given above:(49)    a’ko          akamba-n-e -a=n
        PRO.n 1 earth-LN-APPL-LV=2
        ‘This is our land.’                                                  {EA 13, 051}(50)    jayna n         pul-a-lo:los n-os      lolos-e -a=y’ i

        ‘Then I swept our yard.’                               {EA, Sueño 154}The possessive construction can encode a more abstract relationship between two
geographical entities:(51)    as      ben‘i-n-e -a=as                       Peru, as        apere-ben‘i
        ART.n grassland-LN-APPL-LV=ART.n              Perú ART.n Apere-grassland
        ‘The grasslands of (the village) Perú, the Apere (river) land.’     {EA, Sueño 002}This derivation is not obligatory for denoting possession of a geographical entity. The simple
nominal base can be used here, too, as the following example shows:(52)    a. a’ko  rada=n         ulkwan
           PRO.n door=2         PRO.2sg       ~ b. a’ko     rada-n- e=n            ulkwan
            PRO.n door-LN-CO=2              PRO.2sg
            ‘It is your door.’                                               {EA 12, 256}The use of this marker seems to depend on the speaker: some speakers use it consistently in
the appropriate context, while others do not use it at all to indicate possession of a geographic
entity. The following example is from a speaker of this group (compare it with (49) above):(53)    as       akamba=y’ i        iy’ i        indi:jena
        ART.n earth=1pl             PRO.1pl      indian
        ‘the land of ours, the Indians’                                    {GC, Marcha 034}                                                                                              241
The affixation of -e /- e is not possible on all nouns which denote a geographic entity. On the
noun inwa ‘big river’, for example, the use of the suffix is ungrammatical:(54)    *as     inwa:-n-e
        ART.n river-LN-APPL
        ‘(my river)’                                                      {EA 12, 260a}However, like all non-relational nouns (cf. 6.3), this noun can receive regular possessive
marking:(55)    a. a’ko=s          inwa=y’ i
           PRO.n=DET river=1pl
           ‘It’s our river.’I will now turn to the suffixation of -e /- e to body-part terms. Here, the suffix creates a noun
that is used to denote a part of an inanimate whole. This often leads to lexicalization:(56)    a. as     bo:sa
           ART.n arm
           ‘my arm’        b. is       bosa-ne -a=as               bulu:sa
           ART.pl arm- APPL-LV=ART.n            blouse
           ‘the sleeves of the blouse’        c. as      bosa:-ne
           ART.n arm-APPL
           ‘my sleeve’                                                  {JM 17, 133a}Often, the semantic relationship between the noun with -e /- e and the source noun is not so
transparent. For example, when the noun root kwa ‘mouth’ receives the suffix -e /- e, it
denotes the top of an object (not an opening). This can be seen in the following examples:(57)    a. as     kwa:-n-a=n
           ART.n BR.mouth-LN-LV=2
           ‘your mouth’        b. as       kwa-n- e=as                 me:sa

needs to be tested.","[262, 263, 264, 265, 266]"

located in a container, so that it can be perceived as manipulable, it can easily be referred to
by the plural form, even though it is the Ground in a motion event.71 This leads to two
apparently equivalent encoding possibilities, as shown by (72)a and b. In contrast, when the
term to:mi ‘water’ is used to refer to a larger pond, lake, etc., plural marking is not accepted,
as shown by (73)a and b.(72)     a. tat-a-pa-n- e                    as       kachi:ra n-as        to:mi

            {JM 18, 307c}As usual, there are some counter-examples. Especially when reference is made to manipulable
water, and the plural article would be expected, it is sometimes encoded as singular.72(74)     to:mi, a’ko        sota’-ra     di’ yey-na, as           to:mi

         ‘Water, that’s the only thing I want (to drink), water.’       {EA, Antojos I 016}A third type of entity encoded as plural, besides plural countable entities and masses, are
rolled-up or folded long objects without an internal structure, such as ropes, threads, cables
etc. (but not snakes). When rolled up or folded, an entity of this type is usually referred to as
plural, as in the following two examples:
71
   My use of the term ‘Ground’ is based on Talmy (1985: 61): the ‘Ground’ in a motion event is the reference
object with respect to which another object, the ‘Figure’, moves or is located.
72
   Possibly, number marking in Movima is partly influenced by Spanish (also in the case of the irregularities
encountered with the noun to:mi ‘water’), especially since the stucture of the Spanish noun phrase is similar.
This would explain why there is variation in the cases where Movima categorization of nominal concepts is
different from that in Spanish (mass nouns are combined with a singular article in Spanish).","[174, 175]"

9.2.2. Incorporation of body-part terms
The incorporation of body-part terms is the most transparent type of modifying incorporation:
here, a noun is incorporated which can also occur independently. As is illustrated in (49), this
process allows the possessor of the body part to be expressed as the absolutive argument. In
(49)a, the body-part term occurs in an argument NP, and in (49)b, it is incorporated, so that
the possessor occurs in the argument NP:(49)    a. loy i         tan-na     as    risa-<kwa~>kwa=‘ne
           ITN 1         cut-DR     ART.n BR.hair-<INAL~>ABS=f

            {EA 14, 241}Once the body-part term is incorporated, it cannot be expressed by a free NP anymore:(50)    a. loy in      loj-ba:ri

in (49) above, only its root is incorporated. This is in contrast to argument incorporation,
where the full noun can be incorporated (cf. 9.1.2). Example (51)a is of the same pattern as
(49)b. Here we see a bivalent verb denoting an action whose undergoer is affected with
respect to a particular body part. In (51)b, in contrast, the noun is incorporated together with
the absolute-state suffix -kwa. The suffix indicates that the noun denotes a separate entity
undergoing the action. This is a case of argument incorporation, which has a valency-
decreasing effect. As illustrated by (51)c, an unmarked body-part term cannot be incorporated                                                                                                381

As could be seen in 9.2.2, modifying incorporation can serve the purpose of specifying the
affected part of the undergoer of an event. This does not only concern body parts. Typical
incorporated bound nominal elements denoting parts of wholes include -pit ‘half, middle’ and
-cho ‘inside’. In (55), examples of verbs with the bound element -pit ‘half, middle’ are given.(55)    tam-pin            ‘to be cut through’
        kam-pin            ‘to be broken (a long object)’
        sum -pin           ‘to be tied around the middle’
        vi’-pin            ‘to lie across sth. (e.g. a tree across a road)’
        ju -pin            ‘to be hugged around the waist’
382
The core meaning of the element -cho is that the object is affected in such a way that its inside
is visible (cf. (38)b above). The following are more verbs containing this element:(56)        pe -cho               ‘to be torn open’
            e -cho                ‘to be bitten open (e.g. fruits)’
            paj-cho               ‘to be parted (e.g. a fruit)’
            loj-cho               ‘to be washed inside (e.g. a cup)’
            da’-cho               ‘to be cut open at a surgery’
            paj-cho               ‘to be cut open, in halves’The meaning of other bound nominal elements found in verbal bases is more difficult to
identify. Another bound element denoting a part of whole may be to ‘BE.side’, probably
truncated from to:maj ‘my side’. It occurs in some words whose first part is not semantically
identifiable and not productively combined with other bound elements. This is the case, for
example, with the roots bas- and nen- in (57):(57)        da’        in   bas-to     da’       nen-to:-na      ney, daya’      in bas-to
            DUR.nst 1intr ?-BE.side DUR.nst ?-BE.side-DR here DUR.nst 1intr ?-BE.side
            ‘I was lying on my side, on my side like this, I was lying on my side.’
            {EA, Anoche 012}There are probably more incorporated elements which denote a part of whole. The elements
-pit and -cho can be seen as prototypical examples.
  Verbs containing a bound element denoting a part of whole, including body-parts, are very
productive for subsequent argument incorporation (cf. 9.1.1):(58)        loy in       loj-a-cho-cha-wa:so
            ITN 1intr wash-DR-BR.inside-DR2- glass

Modifying incorporation is very productive for indicating of the Ground (i.e., a goal or
location) with respect to which an event takes place.219 These verbs are generally combined
with the suffix -e , unless they end in a lateral fricative. In addition, they can be combined
with the agentive voice marker -e e, unlike other verbs with an incorporated modifier. Both
these phenomena will be discussed in detail in section 9.8.3 below.","[404, 405, 406]"

        ‘But she is the one who did it, it wasn’t me, it was her.’     {EA, La nuera 002}The bound personal pronouns are attached to a content word either by external or by internal
cliticization (cf. 3.9). Example (14) shows internal cliticization of a bound pronoun to a noun,
(15) shows internal cliticization of a bound pronoun encoding ARG1 to a bivalent predicate,
and example (16) shows external cliticization of a bound pronoun encoding the absolutive
argument of a monovalent predicate.(14)    as        bay im-a=is

        walk--pl.a
        ‘They walk.’In Table 9 above, two alternative forms are given for the presential bound pronouns: one with
a final glottal stop and one without a glottal stop. Since the glottal stop is present in the
presential free pronouns (e.g. u’ko ‘he’), I take this to be the underlying form. The presence of
the glottal stop in the bound pronoun depends on the final phoneme of the host: when the host
ends in a vowel, the glottal stop is omitted (cf. 2.3.3). This can be seen in (17) (internal
cliticization) and (18) (external cliticization):(17)    joy-a- e=u
        go-DR-CO=m
        ‘He (present) takes X with him.’(18)    ilo:ni--u
        walk--m
        ‘He (present) walks.’When the bound pronoun is attached to a consonant, which is possible with external
cliticization (cf. 3.9.3), the glottal stop is retained:
                                                                                             137

    4.3. The demonstratives
    The demonstrative paradigm is more complex than the other paradigms of referential
    elements. An overview is given in Table 10:62    Table 10. The demonstratives                                                              masc.        fem.              ntr.      plural

    (“demonstrative predicate”), or as a determiner within a noun phrase (“demonstrative
    determiner”). The first two functions are described in Ch. 7 (7.3.3 and 7.9.4, respectively); the
    latter function is illustrated in section 4.4 below. The pragmatic categories encoded by the
    demonstratives are described in detail in section 4.9.","[159, 160, 161]"

        ‘At this hour we were already toasting chivé.’                  {EA, Chaco III 021}The conditions for the occurrence or omission of the NP in a clause containing argument
incorporation require further investigation. In elicitation, speakers usually prefer the clause
with the oblique NP, considering it “more explicit”. It can be expected that the more generic
or semantically ambiguous the incorporated element is (cf. 5.3), the more likely it is for the
free NP to occur, while with an incorporated full noun (as in (112)), this is not the case (cf.
also 9.1). However, there are also examples such as (111), where the free NP cooccurs with a
full incorporated noun. This, in turn, may be due to the fact that the story was told to me and
not to a native speaker, so that the narrator sought to be as explicit as possible. Future
research on the cooccurrence of the incorporated noun and the independent NP will, therefore,
have to involve text counts of discourse data which were produced involving native speakers
only.
   The following examples present further illustration of the use of argument incorporation.
Examples (112)–(115) are cases of occurrence of the same noun as incorporated element and
as an independent NP in adjacent clauses. In (113), the same verb root (wul-) occurs first with
an incorporated argument in an intransitive clause, and then with ARG2 as an independent NP
in a transitive clause. Note the different encoding of the second person: in the first clause, in
which the verbs contain incorporated arguments, it is encoded as ARGintr, i.e. by the proclitic
of Set 2. In the second clause, in which the arguments are not incorporated, the second person
is encoded as ARG1, i.e. by the enclitic of Set 1. From this, the first clause can be identified as
intransitive and the second as transitive.(113)   jayna ij        wul-a-wa:ris,     wul-a-sani:ya,  wul-a-ma:do,

a left-dislocated NP.(114)   di’ ij      wul-a-pe:re,        jayna      kis      pe:re, isko       en-u’-ni
        HYP 2intr sow-DR-plantain DSC              ART.pl.a plantain PRO.pl.a stand-INT-PRC
        ‘If you sow plantains, then the plantains, they remain there.’    {Chaco II 036}In the first clause in (115), the noun pa:di ‘guava’ functions as a predicate nominal (cf. 7.9.1).
In the second clause, the same noun is incorporated into the verb.(115)   ja’ pa:di is             rey joy-a:-kwa, bak-a-pa:di
        just guava ART.pl again go-DR-BEN poke_at-DR-guava
        ‘It was just guavas I went for, I picked guavas.’    {JA, TX 082}                                                                                               285
The incorporated nominal element cannot be modified by a relative clause (cf. 7.11 below), as
shown by (116). In order to achieve modification or quantification of the incorporated
nominal element, an oblique NP has to be added, as in (117).(116)        * u’ko       tikoy-cha-da’ra            di’ oy-ra166

influence the valency of a verb. This is to say, a verb with an incorporated noun or bound
element can undergo voice alternations (cf. 9.2). This type of incorporation typically has a
limitative function (cf. Mithun & Corbett 1999): in the most typical case, the incorporated
element denotes the affected part of the undergoer, as in (118). In (118), it can also be seen
that a verb containing the direct voice marker remains bivalent (shown by the proclitic of Set
1 encoding the first person in (118)a); using a pronoun representing ARGintr, as in (118)b (the
proclitic of Set 2) is ungrammatical. A verb with an incorporated modifier is usually not
combined with a coreferential NP.(118)        a. loy i is-a-kwinto
                ITN 1 roast-DR-cheek
                ‘I’ll burn (your) cheek.’ [lit.: “I’ll cheek-burn you.”]             b. *loy in       is-a-kwinto

the case of argument incorporation, the direct marker can be omitted, in which case the verb is
monovalent:(119)        in      is-kwinto
             1intr roast-cheek
             ‘I burned my cheek.’ [lit.: “I got cheek-burnt.”]

      On certain bases, the direct marker has the form -cha; cf. 8.1.1 and 9.1.","[307, 308, 309]"

3.7.8. Reduplication of bivalent verb roots
Before certain elements, bivalent verb roots (cf. 8.3.1) are entirely reduplicated. Since the
cases found so far concern only bimoraic roots (of the structure CVC or CVCV), this can be
seen as bimoraic reduplication.
  Most bivalent roots are reduplicated when they form a compound together with a bound
nominal element (cf. 5.2):(104)   is~’is-ra
        RED~roast-BE.meat
        ‘roasted meat’(105)   dan~dan-so
        RED~chew-TRC.chicha
        ‘chewed chicha’Also when combined with the verbalizing suffix -ni ‘PRC’ (cf. 11.9), a bivalent verb root is
reduplicated entirely. This construction is not very common and of limited productivity. It
requires further research.(106)   sal~sal-ni
        RED~search-PRC
        ‘to search’                                                    {GC 10, 151c}(107)   aya~’aya:-ni--i
        RED~wait-PRC--pl
        ‘They waited.’                                               {EA 8, 077}3.7.9. Reduplication for prosodic well-formedness
Reduplication enables certain noun roots to occur as independent nouns. This concerns bound
roots, which do not meet the phonological requirement of an independent noun to have three
moras (cf. 2.7.4). Most of them denote inalienably possessed entities. Disyllabic bound roots
undergo infixing reduplication when occurring independently:(108)   as     lo<ba:~>ba
        ART.n BR.body<RED~>
        ‘my body’A monosyllabic noun root can be reduplicated twice to form an independent noun. Here, I
assume prefixing reduplication followed by infixing reduplication (cf. also Ch5-Bound roots).
Consider the case of the monosyllabic bound root du’ ‘BR.back’ in (109). In (109)a, this root
is reduplicated once to form the host for a cliticized bound pronoun, in combination with the                                                                                          93
linking vowel -a (cf. 3.9.1). In (109)b, it is reduplicated twice, because no bound pronoun
and, accordingly, no linking vowel is added (cf. 5.3.2).(109)   a. as      du~duk-a=n                 b. as     du~<du:~>du’
           ART.n RED~BR.back-LV=2                ART.n RED~<RED~>BR.back
           ‘your back’                           ‘my back’Most, but not all, monosyllabic roots are also reduplicated when combined with the absolute-
state suffix -kwa (cf. 5.3.2 and 6.2.3):(110)   be~ben-kwa
        RED~BR.flat_flex-ABS
        ‘its hide, leather’3.7.10. Impersonal verbs
Some impersonal verbs contain a reduplicated element. Reduplication could not be
established as a productive device here, however. The verb in (111) consists of a root which
has undergone foot reduplication (light-heavy):(111)   dewaj~de:waj
        RED~see
        ‘to be visible’The following examples may be further illustrations of the same phenomenon, even though
they are not fully analysable:(112)   de:~de:ye
        RED~?
        ‘to be visible’(113)   o:~’o:wa
        RED~?
        ‘to be audible’   (unanalysable)This phenomenon requires further investigation.","[115, 116, 117]"
