While I am responsible for the analysis presented here and its organisation,
the data it is based upon belong to the Awtuw speaking people of Kamlakwlape,
Wutlakwlape , Wiyuplape , Tupumlape, and Kalaktuwlape .
I am most deeply indebted to the people of Meleylape , who allowed me to live in
their hamlet for fifteen months, who helped me in many ways, and who patiently
taught me their language . Among those who were most forthcoming were Yowmen,
Takiy, Poliw, Altiy, Awkay, Awtiy, Eykiy, Kampo, Keriy, Mimpel , Momoy, Naytow,
Osiy, Ruwmay, Wawpey, Yinow, Napeyre, Nimpiy. I am particularly grateful to
Kewmaey, Yawur, Yakop, and Napeyre, who allowed me to tape their narratives and
to Peyaw, Mimpel, and Ruwmay, who dictated stories to me . There is no way that
I can ever repay my debt to Yawur and Yakop, who helped me to transcribe texts
and provided virtually all of the elicited material I have used.
I am also grateful to the Institute of Papua New Guinea Studies, the Department
of Language at the University of Papua New Guinea, the Sandaun Provincial
Government, the Lumi District Office, and Kewmaey, Councillor for the Awtuw­
speaking area, for their permission to study Awtuw.
A large number of people deserve my thanks for the accommodation they so
graciously provided. Wietze Baron accommodated me at Ukarumpa. Paul of the
Lumi Police Detachment, Ian Bagley and other staff at Lumi High School , Father
Terry and others at St Mary' s Catholic Mission, and Kewmaey allowed me to stay
in their houses in Lumi . And Brian McClintock put me up in Port Moresby.
Leo Yimiten and Lumi District Office Staff helped me in a variety of ways and
made the 1980 census data available to me .
Val Lyon of the Department of Geography, Faculty of Arts at the Australian
National University was kind enough to draw the map.
Ger Reesink, Wietze Baron, Ken McElhanon, Les Bruce, and Dave Scorza of the
Summer Institute of Linguistics (PNG Branch) discussed my proposed fieldwork
with me and provided me with access to some unpublished material in their
library.
Don Laycock, Cecil Brown, Bill Mitchell , and Keith Thomas corresponded with me
and encouraged me while I was in the field.
I would also like to thank Avery Andrews , Cliff Goddard, Ian Green, Walter
Seiler, Tim Shopen and David Wilkins for discussing my work with me, and Cliff
and David in particular for their valuable comments on draft chapters .
The Australian National University provided me with a generous scholarship
which made it possible to undertake this project at all .
Finally, my gratitude to Tanya and Adam McConvell for their support and
encouragement is unbounded.                                       iv

                                             The data upon which I base the description presented here was collected in the
                                             course of a field trip of 15 months' duration' (November 1979 February 1 9 8 1 )                                         -
                                             in the village of Kamnum, the largest of the five Awtuw-speaking villages .
                                             Insofar as possible I have gleaned examples from a small corpus of narrative
                                             text. But I have also used elicited examples to illustrate points where
                                             necessary.
                                             The content and structure of this description rest on a number of assumptions
                                             which I will attempt to make explicit.
                                              1 . 1 . 1 Language is a singularly prominent facet of culture in that it serves as
                                              the main repository and channel of communication of culture. But there are
                                              areas of linguistic structure that may in most cultures be described
                                              conveniently and without significant distortion as discrete from other aspects
                                              of culture.
                                              within the domain that is nuclear to language, there are a number of structural
                                              components that mediate between meanings to be conveyed and the acoustic code
                                              through which they are transmitted. These components are the proper subject of
                                              linguistic description.
                                              1 . 1 . 2 The physical properties of the acoustic code are marginal to linguistic
                                              description. Similarly, the nature of the relations between expressible
                                              meanings and cognitive processes on the one hand and external reality on the
                                              other, are marginal to the description of linguistic structure.
                                              within this periphery are three main structural components. The phonological
                                              component mediates between meaningful forms and the acoustic code through which
                                              they are transmitted. The lexical component mediates between lexical forms and
                                              expressible meanings. And the grammatical component organises the composition
                                              and combination of lexical forms , mediating, as it were , between the other two
                                              components .
                                              Viewed in this way, the grammatical component is central to linguistic structure.
                                              I intend here to present a comprehensive, even if not exhaustive , description
                                              of the morphology, syntax, and morphosyntax of Awtuw. Because Awtuw is a
                                              previously undescribed language, I include information on aspects of the
                                              language peripheral to my main concerns. Specifically, Chapter 1 places the
                                                                                                                                                          1

language in its social and sociolinguistic context, Chapter 2 provides an
overview of Awtuw's rich phonological and morphophonological system, Chapter   11
examines the structure of a few lexical fields of general interest, and Chapter
12 describes some paralinguistic phenomena.
1 . 1 . 3 The aims and methodology of linguistic theory and of linguistic
description are fundamentally different. The aim of theory is to delimit and
explain the functions of language in human society and human cognition. Its
methodology must therefore be to establish a set of explanatory principles that
will generate hypotheses about linguistic functions and the ways that languages
can express them. These hypotheses can then be tested against empirical data
about languages.
The aim of linguistic description is to identify the formal classes, categories ,
and structures of a language on empirical , language-internal evidence. Its
methodology must therefore be to examine and analyse such evidence and to
correlate the formal properties so isolated with their semantic functions.
In other words, it must describe language from the addressee's perspective
decoding forms into meanings, rather than from the speaker's perspective
encoding meanings into forms.
This is not to insist that every identifiable form is necessarily in a one-to­
one correspondence with a single meaning; we often encounter examples of
polysemy or structural ambiguity. But, as a heuristic, we do not expect a
mUltiplicity of forms to correspond to a single semantic category.
1 . 1 . 4 The approach taken in this description is therefore essentially
structuralist. I assume the utility of binary features and relative markedness
in distinguishing categories at all levels of structure. I further assume that
features used in a description should correspond to empirically identifiable
categories. Whenever possible, I have attempted to establish a correspondence
between formal categories and plausible semantic categories .
A feature-based analysis has two advantages . Features often cross-classify
such that a small set of formal/functional properties can distinguish a large
number of categories . It is also possible to make certain kinds of generalis­
ations regarding the properties of marked and unmarked categories.
For example, in the analysis of tense marking in Chapter 4, the feature
NONPRESENT at the same time distinguishes Present forms from Past forms, Future
from Desiderative, and Conditional from Frustrative. It also identifies the
morphologically unmarked Present with the semantically unmarked category of
non-NONPRESENT.
Throughout this description, I have aimed to express significant generalisations
intelligibly. When it seemed to further this aim, have borrowed formalisms
                                                    Ifrom Generative theory. I do not mean this to imply any credence in the claims
of the theory. The formalisms merely represent a handy and familiar convention
for schematising certain types of generalisations.
When a language is described in accordance with these principles, the hypotheses
generated by theory can be tested against the description. I have attempted
therefore to present an analysis that is empirically-based and relatively
theoretically neutral , and that reflects the structure of the language
faithfully.

1.2     Geography, gene t i c a ffi l i at i on, h i s to ry, a n d ethnogra phy
1.2.1     Awtuw is the first language of about 400 people living in five villages
between 142°29 ' and 142°3 1 ' East longitude and 3°3 4 ' and 3°3 6 South latitude in
an area of about 30 square kilometres in the southern foothills of the
Torricelli Range in north-western Papua New Guinea (see Map 1 ) . All five
villages are administered as part of the South-west Wapei Census Division of
the Lumi District, Sandaun (West Sepik) Province of Papua New Guinea.
The five Awtuw-speaking villages are located at altitudes ranging from 3 2 0 to
400 metres above sea-level. Rainfall in Kamlakwlape, recorded from May to
December 1980 , ranged from a low of 7 1 . 5mm in June to a high of 2 3 7 . 7mm in
December. Temperatures range from 19 . 4° to 3 2 . 2° Celsius, with an average of
2 2 . 2° at 0600 and 29 . 4° at 1500 daily, with no appreciable seasonal variation.
Table 1.1 lists the five villages with their vernacular names, their names in
Tok Pisin, their populations in 1980 , and the names of the component hamlets.

of early 1981 , its inhabitants were planning to abandon it. The other four
hamlets of Kamlakwlape are clustered within five minutes' walk of each other.
Wutlakwlape' s three hamlets are closely clustered about 45 minutes' walk south­
east of Meleylape. Lalpinlape is about 25 minutes' walk south of Meleylape and
Kalpelape is another 10 minutes' walk south. The two hamlets of Tupumlape ,
located about two hours' walk south of Kalpelape , are adjacent to each other
and all the inhabitants of Kalaktuwlape , which is about two hours' walk south­
south-east of wutlakwlape , live in a single hamlet.

1 . 2 . 2 Laycock ( 19 7 3 ) has classified Awtuw as a member of the Ram ' Stock-level'
Fami ly . He further classif ies this fami ly within the Upper Sepik Super-stock
of the Sepik Sub-phylum of the Sepik-Ramu Phylum . Whi le the postulated broader
relationships are tentative , there is little doubt that the three Ram Fami ly
languages are c losely related ( c f . Laycock and Z ' Graggen 1977 , Wurm 197 1 ) .
Karawa , with some 53 speakers , is spoken in the vi llage of Bulawa , directly
south of the Awtuw-speaking area , and Bouye , with some 642 speakers , is spoken
in the villages of Giliato , Maurom , Wokien , and Yukilo to the south-west ( see

5.9   E x i stence a nd posses s i on
The most ubiquitous state verb is the irregular verb � � ��Y ' whose morphological
peculiarities are described in 4 . 14 . When � � ��Y acts as an intransi tive verb ,
what it predicates is the exi stence o f a non-human entity in a place .

               the litHe be U was [ s ti U ] around
Examples ( 4 2 ) and ( 4 3 ) , which are quoted from narratives , i l lustrate that the
category � � ��Y is sensitive to is humanness and not animacy , because the pig in
( 4 2 ) is dead , but the turtle in ( 4 3 ) is alive . Under certain circumstances
when a non-human NP refers metaphorically to a human - the subject of � � ��Y may
be human .
                                                                                        105

Here p i y re n - Yffin is a metaphor for a promised bride .
More commonly , posture verbs absorb the functions o f � � �� y for human subj ects .
In other words , in expressing the location o f a human being , the additional
category of posture is obligatory .
      (46)     Yawrnan ffiw re- k e d a - k - own a - y
               Yawmen house-L FA-I P - lie- P

               notv   A l tiy FA- I P-si t - I P there
               A ltiy is sitting there now
The re is one verb that constitutes an exception to the general rule stated
above , unless we construe the category of posture very broadly . This is i � i Y
live i n a p laae, stay .
      (49)     rnodak W u t pey d - i k i y a d e
               now    Wutpey FA-live here

From the meaning of � � �� Y illustrated above , i . e . the existence of a non-human
entity in a place , one would expect it to participate in a possessive
construction with the human possessor in the Obj ect case . And this doe s ,
indeed, happen .

for case . Where � � �� Y di splays numbe r agreement , as it usua l ly does not , it
agrees in number with the possesso r .

In such constructions , the posses sed NP never has obj ect marking . But one would
not expect obj ect marking on an indef inite low-empathy obj ect in a c lause with a
high-empathy subj ect ( c f . 6 . 1 and 6 . 2 ) . Possess ion of a definite NP is expres sed
in a verbless predication with a possess ive NP acting as the predicate o f a
definite subject re ferring to the posses sion ( c f . 8 . 3 . 2 ) .

                                        CASE MAR K I NGCase marking in Awtuw distinguishes two classes of substantives . Personal
pronouns and nouns marked for numbe r may take possessive , but not loca tive
marking ( see 3 . 6 . 2 ) . Nouns unmarked for numbe r , Demonstratives , Quanti fiers ,
Obl iviative s , and Interrogatives may take locative marking but not possessive
marking . A third person personal pronoun must follow such substantives and
bear pos sess ive marking for them ( see 7 . 6 ) . The pronoun agrees with the
possessor in number and if singular , optiona lly in gender .
This section considers primarily the functions o f the case markers , which I
list here , for convenience , together with thei r al lomorph s . Further discuss ion
of the morphophono logical alternations af fecting these suf fixes is to be found
in section 2 . 2 . 10 , and there is a di scussion of the formal properties of nouns
and pronouns in sections 3 . 5 and 3 . 6 .

                          6.   Vocative (V)               -wo/-a
This analysis assumes that functions are to be assigned to forms - the formal
case markers del imit the cases and each case has one or more syntactic or
semantic function s .
Whitehead ( 198 1 ) has developed a typology for case marking in Papuan languages
based on the distribution of case markers in nouns and pronouns and the i r
functions in marking Agents (=transitive sub j ects=A (Dixon 197 9 » , Actors (=S) ,
Patients (=0) , Recipients and Bene factive s . Awtuw ' s case marking system , for
both full NPs and pronouns , as well as its pronoun marking , fal ls into his
class l I b , which inc ludes those languages , 19 per cent of his sample of 3 5 ,
that have zero marking on As and Ss and a case marker on Os . Like 13 per cent
of the sample , Awtuw marks Bene factives , Recipients , and Patients in the same
way ( see Fe ldman and Seiler 198 3 ) .","[109, 110, 111, 112, 113]"

Certain low and mid root vowels raise to become mid and high vowels respectively
when unstressed. It seems obvious that this is a single rule, but there doesn' t
appear to be any convenient way of formalising it. Moreover , it eludes simple
expression because it does not apply to low and mid vowels in all roots, nor
even to all low and mid vowels in the same root. The following examples
illustrate the application of the rule to the vowels of four susceptible roots .

In accordance with the descriptive strategy adopted throughout this grammar,
this section will endeavour to segregate on language-internal morpho syntactic
grounds discrete classes of lexemes in Awtuw, to identify subclasses of the
classes so segregated, and to relate the classes thus isolated to universal
semantic categories.
            The most revealing way to view a part-of-speech system
            is as a few large stem classes . . . divided into
            successively smaller classes on the basis of additional
            criteria. (Hockett 1958 : 2 2 1 - 2 2 8 )
Following Hockett, we can impose a structure on our analysis of the Awtuw
parts-of-speech system by dividing Awtuw lexemes into broad classes and
refining these into more restricted classes corresponding to the parts of
speech in Awtuw.
I refine Hockett ' s method by treating each identifying property as a privative
feature , which can segregate two classes according to the presence or absence
of the feature (Trubetzkoy 1969 : 7 4 ) . The presence of a feature characterises
the marked category.
The structure of a parts-of-speech system thus takes on the shape of a
bifurcating tree each of whose branchings represents the segregation of two
classes based on the specification for a given feature. When no additional
formal properties serve to segregate pairs of categories, the branch terminates
in a named class. In some cases it is possible to name superordinate classes .
Figure 3 . a exemplifies the structure.

To clarify the feature specification, I have included a matrix with each tree.
Once a class had been isolated at any level of structure, specification for
features associated with other classes becomes irrelevant to its classification.
Therefore, not all features used in this analysis cross-classify. For example,
referring to Figure 3.a, the specification of Named Class 3 for feature B is
irrelevant to its classification, and will therefore be enclosed in parentheses
in the associated matrix, Table 3 . a.
                                   Ta bl e 3 . a : ( examp l e )
                         FEATURE      CLASS I                        NC 5
                                   NC 1 NC 2                 NC 3           NC 4
                            A                +                        -
                            B        +            -           (- )          (+)                            C       (-   )       (+)           +             -
          While it is assumed here that the assignment of words to
          parts-of-speech classes is based on properties that are
          grammatical rather than semantic, and often language­
          particular rather than universal, it is also assumed that
          the name that is chosen for a particular parts-of-speech
          class in a language may appropriately reflect universal
          semantic considerations . (Schachter, 1985 : 2 ,
          cf. Lyons 1968:147 , 317-319)
I will therefore refrain from assigning names to the classes isolated in this
analysis until they have been refined sufficiently to suggest a correlation
with a universal semantic type (cf. Dixon 1977 :19-20, 24-30, Lyons ' 1 966: 214) .
The diagnostic properties used to segregate the parts-of-speech classes here
will identify all members of any class , including derived forms. But in
assigning names to classes, it is necessary to identify a focal subclass whose
members are necessarily monomorphemic.

First we can segregate those lexemes that accept the Perfect aspect suffix - kay
from those that do not and denominate the segregated class Class I .
Next, we can divide those lexemes that cannot bear aspect marking into two
additional classes. We call those that can occur as the unique constituent of
a noun phrase Class II �nd the residuum that cannot, Class III .
It may clarify this tripartite division to represent the identifying criteria
by binary features and display the specifications for each class on a matrix.
(Values for features that are irrelevant to the classification are enclosed in
parentheses) .

types (cf. Dixon 1 97 7 : 2 5 - 2 9 ) EVENT and ACTIVITY, which typify the part-of-speech
traditionally labelled Verbs. A few examples will demonstrate the constituency
of the class.

           (b) - r a ren- light up ra r e n - ka y has lit up

           (d) - �� k r a - cook              rok r a - kay has cooked
Aside from the ability to accept Perfect marking, affixation marking Tense,
Modality, and a number of other categories characterises verbs. Chapter 4
provides a detailed discussion of verbal morphosyntax, and Chapter 5 will
present a discussion of the subclassification of Verbs .

Each of the two remaining classes can be subdivided further. Class II lexemes
can again be divided into two classes . One subclass has the property of being
able to occur following t a d e r this to form a single constituent, the other does
not.

3 . 3 . 1 Each of the classes segregated by this criterion is subject to further
division. To begin with, we will examine the distinctions among those lexemes
that do occur in the specified environment.

The lexemes that lack this property, as illustrated in example (3a) , have in
common the semantic property of denoting QUANTITY and I therefore call them
Quantifiers. These lexemes can also refer to a quantity. Chapter 7 on the
structure of the Noun Phrase will discuss other properties of the class of
Quantifiers, including their peculiar ability to function either as a
determiner or a modifier of an NP. Section 11. 3 contains a discussion of
Quantifiers , but I include here a list of the most common.

3 . 3 . 2 The other class, whose members do accept the suffix, as illustrated in
examples (3b-e) can be divided into two further classes. Some of them accept
the Adjective-deriving suffix, - neney , the others do not.

The lexemes that lack this property, as illustrated in examples (4a-b) , share
the semantic property of referring constantly to the same token of a type, or
UNIQUE REFERENCE (Foley 1986 ) . In accordance with tradition I will call these
lexemes Proper Nouns .
30
The other class, whose members accept the suffix as shown in examples (4c-d) ,
share the semantic property of constantly referring to tokens of the same type,
or CONSTANT REFERENCE, and I will accordingly denominate them Common Nouns .
A further feature, the ability to accept the Dual suffix, -wrew , serves to
divide each of these classes in two.

Example ( 5 ) illustrates the distinction among proper nouns. The proper nouns
that accept the suffix share the semantic property of referring uniquely to a
person, while those that do not refer to places and I accordingly denominate
them Personal Names and Place Names respectively.
Common nouns that accept        share the semantic property of referring to
                                      -wrewrelatives and are called Kinship Terms. Example (6c) shows that the distinction
is not between human and non-human common nouns or between animate and inanimate
common nouns. While in most respects syntactically identical to other common
nouns, it will become apparent in Chapter 7 that kinship terms need to be
distinguished from the other common nouns here. section 3 . 5 presents a
description of the other formal properties of nouns .
Table 3 . 2 displays the feature specifications for each of the subdivisions in
this class and Figure 3 . 2 illustrates the structure of the classification.

those that may not follow tade r this to form a single constituent. These
lexemes share the semantic property of referring to tokens of different types,
or SHIFTING REFERENCE. In accordance with the usual convention, I call them
Pronouns .
Two additional features divide the pronouns into four distinct classes.
Example ( 7 ) shows that some pronouns may agree with a following noun in number,
while others do not.
     (7)    (a) tey t a l e
                 3FS woman
                 the woman
            (b) om t a l e - m
                     r                     3PL woman - PL
                     the women
             (c) tade- t t a l e
                     this-FS woman
                     this woman
             (d) t a d u-m t a l e- m
                     this-PL woman-PL
                     these Women
             (e) mene tey             t a l e ( -m }
                     whatchamacal lit woman-PL
                     what 's her/their name (s ) ?
             (f) ye ran t a l e ( -m }
                     who ? woman-PL
                     what woman/women?
For the nonce we may call the class of pronouns that may agree with a following
noun in number Class A , and the class that does not, Class B .
32
Crosscutting this distinction is the ability of some pronouns to accept the
Locative suffix - kef - e .
     (8)  (a) * rey-ke
                3MS-L
          (b) *ye r a n - ke
               who ?- L
          (c) t a d e r - ke
                this- L
               at this one
          (d) men e rey-       ke
                whatchamaca l li t-L
                at whatchamacal li t
There are thus four classes of pronouns :
(a) Personal Pronouns like rey , which distinguish number but do not take
Locative marking,
(b) Demonstrative Pronouns like tade r , which distinguish number and accept
Locative marking,
(c) Interrogative Pronouns like y e ra n , which neither distinguish number nor
take Locative marking, and
(d) Obliviative Pronouns like mene rey , which do not distinguish number, but
do take Locative marking.
Table 3 . 3 exhibits the feature specifications for the four classes of pronouns .
Other pronominal properties are discussed below in section 3 . 6

We can now rename Class II lexemes, i.e. those that can be the unique
constituent of a Noun Phrase, as Substantives. Figures 3 . 3 displays the
structure of the subcategorisation of the class , and Table 3 . 4 displays their
feature specifications.

3.4   C l a s s i f i cati o n o f non s u b s tanti v e s
The lexemes i n C lass I I I fal l into several subc lasses . F i r s t w e can i solate the
subclass whose members share the property of following a personal pronoun and a
common noun to form a s ingle constituent .

The lexemes that fal l into this c lass belong to the semantic types AGE ,
DIMENS I ON , VALUE , SPEED , PHYS ICAL PROPERTY , and HUMAN PROPENSITY ( c f . Dixon
1 9 7 7 : 3 1 ) . I will again venture to specu late that if a language has a
g rammatically identi fiable class whose membership is typified by the semantic
type s DIMENSI ON and VALUE , then that class may appropriately be denominated
Adj ective s .
A sma l l subclass of Awtuw Adj ectives is identif iable by the abil i ty of its
members to intervene between another adj ective and a common noun to form a
s ingle constituent .
The Intens i f iers , mede and yapo r qui te , very and yankeyke a little may modify
Nouns , other Adj ectives , or certain Adverbs ( cf . 7 . 4 ) .
      ( 11 )   (a)   wa r u ke mede neme t
                     big       very mother
                     a very big mother
               ( b ) '<wa ruke monokene neme t
                       big     bad       mother
                     *a badly ( ? ) big mother
The other Ad j ectives constitute an apparently closed class of about 3 6 member s
which can be categorised according to their semantic type . Note that one of
the D IMENSION ad j ectives is also an intensifier and that two of the AGE
ad j ectives , oWyffin and ow t i ykaYffin o ld also functions as nouns , meaning old man .
The only SPEED adj ective a l so functions as an adverb , a property I suspect of
be ing common for SPEED adjective s . In Engl ish , for example , one SPEED
adj ective,  f a s t , not only functions as an adverb , but may not even accept the
                                                                                            35
productive adverb-deriving suffix - l y . Two other SPEED adjectives , s l ow and
q u i c k , which may accept - l y , regularly function adverbially without it. Those
SPEED adjectives that take - l y obligatorily in adverbial function , like l a ng u i d ,
d i l a t o r y , p r ec i p i t a t e , rap i d , and even sw i f t may more appropriately be
classified as MANNER adjectives. Like q u i c k , kupkwa p , may accept the adverb­
deriving suffix, but also functions adverbially without it.

Colour terms, which are not monomorphemic Adjectives, receive further discussion
in section 1 1 . 2 .
Derived Adjectives with the suffix - n eney , which compensate to a great extent
for the paucity of monomorphemic adjectives, share their properties (cf. 3 . 8 . 1 ).
On the basis of their acceptance of the suffix - kwo/ -wo like, simi lar to, sort
of (cf. 3 . 8 . 2 ) , we can discriminate two further subclasses within Class III .
     ( 1 3 ) (a) ade- kwo
                   here-like
                   around here

                    soon- like
                   *around soon
The subclass that accepts the suffix i s difficu lt to characterise in terms o f
semantic type , but i t does include tokens of TIME and MANNER . S o without
speculating on the univer sality o f the category I w i l l call this class Adverbs .
On semantic grounds , there are three types of Adverbs - Demonstrative Adverbs ,
Interrogative Adverbs , and ' Lexica l ' Adverbs . Table 3 . 6 disp lays a l l the
members of the first and second type s . Further discuss ion of the forms of these
adverbs is to be found in section 3 . 8 . 2 .
with the exception of kupkwap quickly , ' Lexica l ' adverbs a l l denote time or
d i stance and I d i scuss them and l i s t them in ful l in a later section on
Numeration and Measurement i n section 1 1 . 3 . Table 3 . 6 therefore exhibits only
a few examples .","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42]"

3. 7   Compound i ng
Awtuw has three basic compounding strategies . Two of these compound two nouns
to form a third noun . The other strategy , which compounds two verb roots to
form a verb stem with the same inflectional poss ibilities as a monomorphemic
root , may not be a compounding strategy at all . I have described the re levant
phonemenon in section 4 . 1 2 and 10 . 1 , but feel that it deserves mention in this
section .
                                                                                      47
3 . 7 . 1 There are two strategies for compounding noun s . Because of their
similarity to compounding strategies in Sanskrit , I have used the Sanskrit
names to distinguish them .
First , and least productive among the Awtuw compounding strategies , i s the
Dvandva  compound ( c f . Whitney 1960 : 485-487 ) . This strategy compounds two
common nouns to form a third common noun whose meaning i s a coordination of the
two components . Example ( 3 1 ) i l lu strate s the two most common Dvandva compounds .
      (31)   (a)   neme t+ lJawe r
                   mother+father
                   mother and father� parents
             (b)   r i pye+a 1 me
                   bow+ arrow
                   bow and arrow
3 . 7 . 2 I n the second strategy for compounding two common nouns , the first
mod i f ies or somehow restricts the meaning of the second . Like the Ta tpurusa ,
or ' determinative ' compounds in Sanskrit or C lassical Greek ( c f . Whitney 1 9 60 :
481 , 490-491 , Smyth 1 9 2 0 : 2 52 ) , it may be u se fu l to conceive of the first
component as standing in a dependent , or case , relation with the second .
      (32)   (a)   n i w+ <ewre
                   ground+house
                   house on the ground
             (b)   �p i y�n+ <ewre
                   chicken+house
                   house for chickens
      (33)   (a)   yuwp+ t a pwo
                   kunai+fire
                   fire made of kunai
             (b)   t i y l + yekne
                   s tone+axe
                   axe made of stone
             (c)   emek+    tepe
                   pandanus+sago 'pudding '
                   sago 'pudding ' made with pandanus
The examples in ( 3 3 ) il lustrate situations where the name of a distinctive
material restricts the meaning of a noun that may characteristica l ly denote
something made with other materials .
      (34)   (a)   0 1 e+ yaw
                   bush+pig
                   pig from the bush
             (b)   Wu t l a kw+t a l e
                   Gutaiye+woman
                   woman from Gutaiye
Example ( 3 4 ) i l lu strate s compounds where the first component designates the
source of the second . Example ( 3 5 ) shows a compound where the first component
designates the characteristic inhabitants of the second .
48
     (35)           Qa l e+y i w
                    fish+water
                    waterho le ful l of fish
F ina l ly , the first component noun may denote a whole of which the second forms
a part .
     ( 3 6)   (a)   CI:lW r '+ or
                    house+top
                    roof
              (b)   taw+ t i w
                    tree+hair
                    fo liage
              (c)   w i y t a pe+y i 1
                    river+ edge
                    river bcmk
              (d)   r i we+ 1 ake
                    foot+bone
                    bone of the leg
Further discuss ion of compounds l ike the one in ( 3 6a) is to be found in
section 6 . 5 .
As mentioned above , thi s strategy i s quite productive . The resulting compound
nouns bear all the same properties as monomorphemic common nouns , including the
abi l ity to enter into similar compounds .
      (37)    ( a ) [ p i y ren+na l e ]+ l ukw
                      dog+      hole+ middle
                      the middle of a doghole
              (b) [ t aw+ t i w ]+d i yake
                    tree+hair+under
                    the underside of the foliage
3 . 7 . 3 The other strategy compounds two or more verb roots to form another verb
stem which enters into the verb complex as if it were a single root . While any
verb may be the first in such a compound , the second and subsequent roots are
se lected from a clo sed set of about 30 member s . About a third of the members
of this set may themselves function as independent verb roots in meanings
reasonably closely re lated to the meanings they express in a compound . The
balance bear no phono logical resemblance to any independent verb root , although
they al l have a phonologica l shape that would be plausible for one .
The morphemes that may occur as the second and subsequent components of such a
compound range in meaning from �2� give , which marks verbs with a benefactive
argument , through aspectual meanings l ike ! ��� begin and �2 � � � comp le te ly ,
auxi l iary- like meanings l ike (�� � ) e � try , and adverbial meanings l ike � �� !�
secre t ly , to meanings that more closely resemble a second predicate , l ike � ��� �
. . . and g o away .
There is no apparent correlation between the independence of the morpheme and
the independence of its meaning from that of the matrix verb root . Thus , kow
the bene factive marker , which has the most clearly ' grammatical ' meaning of the
                                                                                        49
morphemes in this set , is among the commonest verbs in the language used
independently . But � �Y!:!� . . and go Cf1;)ay , one of the morphemes with the most
                                     .
conspicuously independent meanings , bear s no resemblance to any independent
verb root .
These factors conspire t o make the situation highly ambiguous . The membership
in this class of verb roots that occur independently suggests that the
structure is one of compounding , or of a very tight , partly crystalised , verb
serialisation , or both ( c f . 10 . 1 . 1 ) . But the generally ' grammatica l ' nature of
the meanings expressed suggest an analys i s of the morphemes concerned as verb
affixe s .
I have therefore mentioned the phenomenon here i n the section on compounding
and in the section on verb serialisation ( c f . 10 . 1 . 1 ) , while presenting a full
description , including a complete list of the morphemes in the class , in the
discuss ion of verbal morphosyntax in section 4 . 1 2 .","[52, 53, 54, 55]"

They exhibit three categories of number and three of person with a female/
non-female d i s t inction in the third person s ingular .
Whi l e there is a degree of suppletion in the paradigm , we can make a few
correlations between forms and the categories that they mark . The most
striking regularity is that the plural forms con s i stently end in the segments
lom/ . A s imilar regularity occurs in the first and second person dual forms ,
which both end in lan/ . The first person dual and plural forms both begin with
In l , while the corresponding second person forms begin in a vowe l . Final l y ,
the third person dual and plural forms , as well as the unmarked third person
s ingular , have an initial I r / .

Wurm ( 1 9 7 7 a ) has drawn attention to a remarkable consistency among the diverse
languages of New Guinea in the forms of certain personal pronouns . Examining
the s ingular forms in all three persons and the first and second person plural s ,
h e finds that most of the pronouns marking these categories throughout New
Guinea fall into one of three basic sets and that a given language wi l l often
select most of its pronouns from the same set or in a predictable way from two
or a l l three set s . Because the pronominal forms in a given set crop up over a
geographically large area and in no way restrict themselves to s ingle genetic
groupings , Wurm concludes that personal pronouns are , contrary to popular
opinion , commonly borrowed from language to language .
Awtuw ' s personal pronouns are quite consi stent in their set membership . The
second person plural form bears no resemblance to the pronouns in any of the
sets Wurm has establ i shed . But the other four categories a l l display Set I
feature s .
One of the postulated Set I forms for third person singular i s / te / , which
resembles the corresponding female form in Awtuw quite c losely . There i s a l so
a predictable consonant alternation , character istic of Set I pronouns signal l ing
the gender distinction in the third person s ingular . A property of second
person s i ngular forms in Set l aX appears to end in a coronal consonant and
begin with a /y/ , as does the Awtuw form /ye n / . S imilar l y , Set I first person
forms typica lly contain an / n / , while Set X forms add to this a /wV - / in the
s ingular , and an /-m/ in the plura l , yie lding the Awtuw forms /wa n / and / nom/ .
Personal pronouns have a somewhat different set of morphological properties
from nouns , demonstratives , and interrogatives . With regard to the suff ixes
they may accept , nouns marked for number resemble personal pronouns . In other
respects , however , personal pronouns are unique .
First of a l l , only personal pronouns may bear the Possessive suffix -ke ,
described in 6 . 3 . Second , the Obj ect suffix on personal pronouns has the
canonical form -e , subj ect to vowe l harmony ( cf . 2 . 2 . 1 0 ) , and does not exhibit
the sex gender agreement characteristic of the corresponding suffix on other
substantive lexemes . And third , personal pronouns may never bear the Locative/
Direction suffix -e/ke , described in 6 . 5 .

I n addition to the properties they share with number-marked nouns , personal
pronouns have three dis tinctive morphosyntactic characteristics .
Personal pronouns take the suffix - yffin to form what we may call Emotive
pronouns . These are u sed when the speaker wants to e l icit sympathy for the
referent of the suffixed pronoun .

I n origin , this suffix i s very probably a diminutive . I t is homophonous with
the noun yffin chi ld, which compounds fair ly productively with other nouns to
denote the young of an animal or a sma l l token of the type denoted by the bare
noun .

Second , personal pronouns may reduplicate in full to form what I c a l l Emphatic
pronouns . Such forms have two bas i c functions - to emphasise an argument ,
usua l ly in contrastive s i tuations , and to s ignal coreference with the preceding
subj ect . In thi s latter case , emphatic pronouns bear the possess ive suffix
when the possessor i s coreferential with the subj ect , bear the reflexive marker
44
' when the direct or indirect obj ect is coreferential with the subj ect , and mark
  the subj ect of a succeeding clause , with or without the ref lexive marker , to
  mark it unambiguously as coreferential with the preceding subject ( c f . 5 . 1 ,
  10 . 6 ) .

Note that as the examples above i l lustrate , emphatic pronouns take the same
suff ixes as ordinary personal pronouns . But they dif fer in two respects - they
may not take yren and they may not themselves reduplicate .","[47, 48, 49, 50]"

The Determiner in this NP prevents any ambiguity from ari sing with regard to
co-re ferentiality . I f the three NPs were not co-referential , the most idiomatic
construction would concatenate equative predications ( c f . 8 . 4 ) , as in ( 4 4b) .
     (44)     ( b ) ( u r u n k rame ) , dam i rame t u k r e rame , dcen i rame . .                         .

                    (three men) , one man is short, one man is . . .
Example ( 44c ) il lustrates the consequences of concatenating NPs quantified with
a numeral .
              ( c ) ( y i y l e dcen i mak o r kweyna ywo rame ) , t u k re rame u r unk ,
                      hand a           p lus four         man      short man three

7 . 6 . 2 The second NP may a l so cons ist of a more ful ly expanded Nominal
constituent , inc luding a Clause constituent ( S ) ( c f . 10 . 2 . 8 ) .

The structure of this NP is di splayed in [ 45 ] .

7 . 6 . 3 The second NP may also consist of a n unadorned Clause constituent
functioning as a non-restrictive Relative c lause , as in ( 4 6 ) . Example [ 46 J

                                       IAppos itional re lative c lauses may also be verbless predications as in example
(47) .

                   another man      skin ringwoY'm-Y

Where the subj ect of the relative c lause is dele ted by co-re ference with the
head noun , a predicated Adj ective Phrase must be fully expanded to [ Ad j ective
I ntens i fier J , as in example ( 4 8 ) .
      (48)     (a)    [ w i y t a pe yapor J wa ruke vapor

7 . 6 . 5 Probably the s ingle most pervasive form o f NP serialisation places an NP
consisting of a Determiner in serial with a more fully expanded NP .

                                      CASE MARKER
This non-re strictive strategy is used to permit NPs other than Personal
Pronouns and number-marked nouns to accept possessive marking.

7.7   Case ma rk i n g
7 . 7 . 1 Under ordinary circumstance s , any case marking will occur on the last
word in the NP , as stipulated in rule 1 . Quantifiers , Intensi fiers , and
Adj ectives , as we ll as nouns and pronouns , may all carry the case marking for
the NP .

134
7 . 7 . 2 There are two peculiar constructions that bear discussion in this
context. Both have low functional loads and are probably arcane literary
device s . I n one case , two ful l NPs i n a co-ordinate construction take a single
case marker on the end of the second , as in example ( 56 ) .
      ( 56 )   Wa ypaw i y d - i w rek-e Qaye Ta k i y eywe W i l t i w- re new naw- 0
               Waypawiy RL-stand-p father Takiy ancestor Wi ltiw-o eye wait-P
               Waypawiy begot [ my ] father, Takiy and his e lder brother, Wi ltiw
In the othe r , we f ind two NPs co-ordinated , with separate case marking on each ,
where the semantic re lation between them is posses sive , as in examples ( 5 7 ) and
(58) .
       ( 5 7 ) t a pwo- re uyk- re rey d- ayn- e
               fire- 0 odour-o 3MS RL-sme l l-p
               he sme l led the fire and the odour
      (58)     p i y l a ke- re a l woraw- re kan - uwpa - m
               tooth- 0 mouth- 0 IMP- look-PL
               examine the teeth and mouth
A more idiomatic way of expressing ( 5 7 ) would involve an overtly possessive
construction , as in ( 59a) , or a t a tpuru�a compound ( c f . 3 . 7 . 1 ) , as in ( 59b) .
      (59)     (a)   t a pwo rey-ke uyk- re rey d - ayn- e
                     fire 3MS-P odour-o 3MS RL-sme l l-p
                     he sme l led the odour of the fire

                     fire + odour-o 3MS RL-sme l l-p
                     he sme l led the odour of fire

                                        V E RBLESS PRE D I CAT I ONSBy identifying diagnostic criteria and applying them sequentially as we have
done elsewhe re , we can segregate verble ss predications into type s .
Several of the distinctions I make in this classi fication rely heavily on the
analys is of the structure of the Noun Phrase which I have presented in de tai l
i n Chapter 7 .","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141]"
"
3 . 8 . 1 The suffix - neney i s enormous ly productive and regularly forms
apparently nonce express ions from any e l igible noun , i . e . any common noun .
Its basic meaning would appear to be to attribute the noun bearing the suffix
as a property or posses sion of the noun that the derived adj ective mod i f ie s .
The examples i n ( 3 8 ) illu strate these two meanings .
      ( 38 )   (a)     neknek-   neney
                       knowledge-y
                       c lever
               (b)     ffiW re- neney
                       house-y
                       having a house
               (c)     YffiY+ t i w- neney
                       skin+hair-y .
                       hairy
               (d)     yen kay- neney
                       husband-y
                       married (of woman)
Another important function of thi s suffix is to take up the s lack left by
Awtuw ' s closed class of adj ectives . Unl ike many other languages with closed
adj ective classes , many of the gaps in the inventory of basic adj ectival
50
meanings are filled not by nouns or verbs ( cf . Schachter to appear p . 1S ) , but
rather by derived adj ectives with - n eney .
     (39)      (a)   t a pwo- neney
                     fire- y
                     hot
               (b)   n ampe t - neney
                     co ld- y
                     cold
               (c)   y i w- neney ( c f . rey 1 e dry )
                     water-y
                     wet, fu l l of water
3 . 8 . 2 As noted above , - kwo/-wo has a number of functions . The distribution of
the two a llomorphs appears to be lexically conditioned . Perhaps most important
among these is the derivation of colour terms . Section 1 1 . 2 contains further
discussion of colour terminology .
      ( 4 0)   (a)   t i p ra y - kwo
                     soot- like
                     b lack
               (b)   reyp i y- kwo
                     b lood- like
                     red
               (c)   nene 1 - wo
                     unripe- like
                     green
Examples ( 40a) and ( 40b) il lustrate the derivation of ad j ectives from nouns and
( 40c) il lustrate s the derivation of an adj ective from another adj ective .
Another important function of this suffix is to derive an extremely common
adj ective .
      (41)           1 um-wo
                     fat- like
                     s low, easy
Thi s suffix may be added to any adj ective to fudge its meaning .
      (42)     (a)   pa r p a r - kwo
                     sharp-like
                     kind of sharp
               (b)   t u k re- 1 i ke
                     short- like
                     kind of short
I t has an important function in a type of comparative predication , discussed
in chapter S .
      ( 43 )         yen-ke reymen wa n - ke - kwo
                     2SG-PS knife l S G-ps- like
                     your knife is like mine
                                                                                   51
Finally , the same suffix productively derives adverbs from nouns ,
demonstratives , and other adverbs .
      (44)   (a)   p i y re n - kwo
                   dog-         like
                   like a dog
             (b)   Po l i w- kwo
                   Po liw- like
                   like Po liw
      (45)   (a)   topo r - kwo
                   that- like
                   thus
             (b)   a d e r - kwo
                   this-like
                   thus
     ( 46)   (a)   ya row-  kwo
                   tomorrow-like
                   around tomorrow
             (b)   tcey- wo
                   near- like
                   sort of near
3 . 8 . 3 The number markers occur on human Common and Proper nouns in the case of
-wcew DUAL and -worn PLURAL and on Place names and most common nouns and
adj ectives in the case of ycen i rn GENERIC . All three of these have the pecu l iar
                                       -
property of deriving a form with some of the morphological character istics of a
personal pronoun from a noun . Both the di stribution of the number markers and
the morphological properties of personal pronouns rece ive fuller discussion in
section 3 . 5 and 3 . 6 . But briefly , where nouns may not take the possessive
suffix - ke , nouns bearing the number markers may . Where a subclass of nouns
may take the locative suffix - a / - ka , nouns with number marking may not . And
where nouns take one of the allomorphs of the object marker beginning with a
consonant , number-marked nouns take the al lomorphs consisting of a vowe l alone .

4. 1   Structure o f the verb compl ex
Many o f the aff ixes discussed in this chapter have already appeared in section
2 . 2 . There I was concerned with the changes phonemes undergo in the presence
of other spec i fied phonemes and boundaries in the verb complex and elsewhere .
Here , I descr ibe the formal morphological simi larities and differences among
verbs , the co-occurrence of affixes , and the meanings and functions of the
affixe s . I llustrative paradigms are to be found at the end of this chapter .
We can begin by examining a few highly expanded forms of typical verbs to
i l lustrate the overall structure of the verb complex and the order of the
elements that it compr ises . For the sake of intel ligibility , I wi l l f irst
display a table o f the slots i n the verb complex and the affixes that may f i l l
them , and then present the evidence for the analys i s . with the exception o f
slot +1 , the l i s t s o f affixes for each slot are exhaustive . I discuss the
aff ixes that occur in slot +1 fully in section 4 . 1 2 .
Co-occurrence restrictions make three examples neces sary to i l lus trate the
relative order of a f f ixes in all slots . I will discuss these in subsequent
section s .
Example ( 1 ) shows the relative order o f a f f ixes i n s lots -8 , - 7 , - 6 , - 5 , -4 ,
- 3 , 0 , +1 , +2 , and +5 .
       (1)   - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 -4        -3 0           +1 +2 +5

and +6 .

Example ( 4a) provides the single most semantically plaus ible combination of
affixes from the same slot avai lable from the inventory . Neverthe less , it is
entirely unacceptable , the form with this meaning being :
         (4)     (b)    -8 -7 0         +5
                        ka -w- a l ow- re
                        NG-NF-speak-Fu
                        can ' t/won ' t speak
The comb ination of slot -6 aff ixes in example ( 5 ) is again ungrammatical in
spite of its semantic plausibility .
         (5)     -8 -6 -6 0           +5
                 a p - ma -w- a l ow- re

                 *don ' t go and speak while [ someone is ] absent
The semantic bizarreness of other concatenations of affixes from the same slot
makes i llustration of the ir unacceptabil ity virtually unnecessary .
The examples below demonstrate that affixes from the various slots are not
permutable . Each example shows a single permutation of affixe s in an otherwise
wel l- formed and minimal verb complex .
         (6)      - 7 -8 0       +5
               '''d - k a - puya-e
                  FA-NG-hit- P
                *didn ' t hit
Example        ( 6)    shows that affixes from slots -8 and -7 are not permutable .
         (7)      -6 -7 0       +5
               '''ma - d - puya-e
                  MT-FA-hit- P
                *went and hit
Example ( 7 ) demonstrates that aff ixes from slots -7 and -6 are not permutable .
A very large number of additional examples , which I hope the reader is wi l l i ng
to forego , would demonstrate the impermutabil ity of affixes in other slots and
of non-adj acent affixe s .","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]"

7 . 3 . 3 Quantifiers are more constrained than Pronouns in the range of Nomina ls
they may determine . A Quantifier may not determine any Nominal that is other­
wise quanti fied in any way , either by a Quanti fier in the Quanti fier constituent
or by number marking on the Noun . Furthermore , a Quantifier may not determine
any Proper Noun or S . Quantifiers may only determine otherwise unquanti fied
Common nouns .

                   *both/al l/three chi ldrenThere is one Quantifier nevertheless worthy of special di scussion . Like the
other Quantifiers , dren i may occur in either the Determiner or the Quanti fier
component .
When dren i determines an NP , it means one, another, the other.
      (24)     (a)   dam i   r ame monokene
                     another man bad
                     another bad man

                     another child
                     another child
When it appears in the Quanti f ier constituent of an otherwise determined NP , it
retains this meaning.
      (25)     opo- m rew r e dren i
               that-PL house other
               those other houses
But i f it occurs as the Quanti fier of an undetermined Nominal , then it marks
the NP as inde finite .
      ( 26 )   (a)   ta l e owyren dren i
                     woman old     a
                     an old woman
               (b)   worn    rey l e dren i
                     coconut dry a
                     a dry coconut
I t is conceivable that the basic meaning of an NP with dren i in any position is
that the referent of that NP is not the most sa lient instance of the type that
the NP denotes (Avery Andrews , pc ) .
                                                                                   125
What i s odd is that when dffin i seems t o b e most determiner-like semantically,
when it signals indefiniteness , it must occur in the Quantifier s lot , where we
would expect it to be less determiner - like . And when i t occurs as a Determine r ,
it has the less determiner- like meaning . I t may be possible t o explain this in
terms of dffin i ' s prede liction to mean precisely one , in thi s pos ition . Dffin i
substitutes for the numeral n a ydowo one in many contex t s . I ndeed , naydowdowo
only one, alone appears to occur much more frequently than the bare nume ral ,
probably because dffin i is the unmarked form for one .
Once we have established that dffin i as a Quantifier is very much l ike the
numeral one , it requires no great leap to see how it has come to mean a , as
the numeral one has in many other language s .
For example , i n Tongan , despite a three-way di stinction o f re ferentiality - the
artic le ha ' non - referential ' contrasting with the article e/he ' referentia l '
which in turn contrasts with the article e/he with an accompanying shift in
stress to the last vowe l in the NP ' definite ' - the commonest way o f marking an
NP as non-referential is to use a construction with the numeral .
     (27)     ma i    fo ' i  s u l uka e      t a ha
              give-me NOUN CL cigarette NUM CL one
              give me a cigarette
Awtuw has a construction precisely parallel to the Tongan .

Three type s of lexemes may take Possessive marking . Any noun with the plural
suffix -m may take Possess ive marking . Forms with the dua l , plural , and generic
suffixe s also accept the Possessive su ffix . And all Personal Pronouns are
eligible to take - ke .
Nouns unmarked for number , including Proper and Place names , demons trative s and
interrogatives are followed by the possess ive form of a third person personal
pronoun . The pronoun carrying possessive marking agrees in number and gender
with the referent of the NP in accordance with the principles discussed above .

Note that one of the Intensifiers , y a n keyke a litt le, s lightly is also a
DIMENSION Ad j ective meaning sma l l , and a Quantifier meaning a little (quantity ) ,
and may occur i n either the Adjective o r the I ntensifier slot .

                      stone light little

Yankeyke may double as an Intens ifier in tongue- in-cheek contexts if the
Adj ective is not yan keyke .

7.5   Word o r d e r p e rmuta t i o n s
When a Common noun is high in empathy , Ad j ective s often , and more complex
Adjective phrases sometimes , precede i t . Examples like ( 38 ) and ( 3 9 ) motivate
the abbreviated Empathy hierarchy in ( 4 0 ) .
      (38)     (a)    wa ruke t a l e
                      big     woman

      (40)    Abbreviated Empathy Hierarchy
              [ +HUMAN ] > [ +ANIMATE ] > [ -ANIMATE ]
In fact , certain c lasses of adjectives have a strong tendency to precede high
empathy nouns . VALUE adj ectives , e . g . rnonokene bad, AGE adj ectives , e . g . owyren
old, and HUMAN PROPENSI TY adjectives , e . g . y i tarn generous are most l ikely to
precede the nouns they modi fy , other clas ses of adjectives , as in ( 4 1d ) and
( 4 1 e ) , do so too .
      (41)     (a)    yi tam   rarne
                      generous man
                      generous man
               (b)    rnede r arne
                      good man

               (c)    owt i ykayren ta 1 e
                      old           woman

               (e)   k u p kwap t a l e
                     fast       woman
                     fast woman
Most PHYS ICAL PROPERTY adjectives e ither may not co-occur with human nouns , as
in ( 41 f ) , or become HUMAN PROPENSITY adj ectives in such constructions , as in
( 4 1h ) . When a PHYSICAL PROPERTY adj ective , as such , modifie s a human noun , it
tends to depersonify that noun , reducing it in empathy . So these are more
l ikely to follow the noun , as in ( 4 1 j )
               ( f ) ""' t a l e warn
                       woman b lunt

                        woman light
                        light woman
Occasionally, a full Adj ective phrase will precede the noun , as in ( 42 a ) .   But
it is more common for the I ntensi fier to follow the Noun , as in ( 42b) .
       (42)      (a)    ya nya n keyke mede neme t

7.6    Nomi n a l s e ri a l i s a t i on
The Awtuw Noun phrase as I have analysed it here i s constrained as to the
amount of information it can accommodate . In particu lar , no Ad j ective Phrase
conta ins more than one adj ective . The question inevi tably arises as to how a
speaker modifies a noun when it is neces sary to attribute more than one
property to that noun .
The answer to this question resides in an explanation of the multiple NPs that
Rule 1 permi ts , and the mu ltiple nominal consti tuents that Rule 2 permits . I
have coined the term nomi n a l seri a l i sa ti on to describe this phenomenon .","[130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136]"
"                    [ PRO ] > [ prN ] > [ +HUMAN ] > [ +ANIMATE ] > [ -ANIMATE ]                                                F i g u re 6 . 1The Object of a clause is optiona lly marked when it is lower in empathy than
the Subj ect ( c f . 6 . 2 ) . Consequently , low-empathy Common noun Objects are
frequently unmarked .

6.2   Obj ect c a s e
The Object suffix ( 0) h a s two forms :
On Nouns unmarked for number , including personal and place name s , on
demonstratives , on interrogative s , and on forms of the verb , it appears as
- re [ -FEMALE ] /- te [ +FEMALE ] . The [ +FEMALE ] form occurs optiona l ly where the
re ferent is female , the [ -FEMALE ] form elsewhere .        ( See 2 . 2 . 10 for a
discussion of the factors conditioning the quality of the suffix vowel . )

On personal pronouns , nouns marked as [ +DUAL ] -wrew or [ +PLURAL ] -wom , and nouns
or adjectives marked as [ +GENERIC ] -yren i m , the form is - el- i /-ol - e , again
determined by morphophonemic considerations .

All Obj ect NPs cons isting of a Pronoun of any type , Demonstrative , I nterrogative ,
Obliviative , or Personal , take Obj ect marking obligatorily . Example ( 8b )
i llustrates that the obligatory interpretation of an unmarked pronoun i s as the
Sub j ec t .

               c f . *the man hit you two/them/this one/who?
A clause with two unmarked pronouns is ungrammatical , as in ( 9b ) .
       (9)     (a)   wan rey-e d u - k- puy-ey
                     l SG 3MS-O FA- I P-hit- I P

All Ob ject NPs that inc lude a Personal Name also take obligatory Obj e c t marking .
An unmarked Personal Name can only be interpreted as the Subj ect .

                      Kampo bit the dog
               c f . *the dog bit Kampo
Two unmarked Personal Name s in a c lause can only be interpreted as conjoined
Subj ect NPs .
      (11)     (a)   Yowman - re Yawu r d u - k- puy-ey
                     Yowmen-O Yawur FA- IP-hit-IP

                      Yowmen Yawur FA- IP-hit-IP
                      Yowmen and Yawur are hitting [ someone ]

               c f . *Yawur is hitting Yowmen/*Yowmen is hitting Yawur
When the Object is equal to or higher than the Subj ect in empathy , it must take
the Object suffix ( c f . examples ( 8 ) and ( 10 ) ) . When two unmarked NPs co-occur
in a c lause , the one that is higher on the empathy hierarchy is again
obligatorily interpreted as the Subj ect .
      (12)     (a)   tey t a l e - re yaw d- re l - i
                     3FS woman-O pig FA-bite-p

When two unmarked NPs equal in empathy co-occur in a clause , they are
interpreted as con j oined Subj ects .

Common Noun Obj ects whose referents are e ither human or definite tend to bear
case marking .
      ( 14 )   (a)   waway nam-o yaw ma- kow- ka . . . Dawe r yaw- re d a - kay-e

                      the younger brother took the younger sister
When an Obj ect is overtly marked as definite by a demonstrative , a persona l
pronou n , or a possess ive in the Determiner slot (cf . 7 . 3 ) , it is especially
like ly to bear case marking , even if the intrinsic empathy of the noun i s low .
                                                                                  III

              mother 3MS fire- smal l-o FA-sme l l-p
              [ his ] mother sme l led the odour of fire
But if the Sub j ect is higher on the empathy hierarchy than the Object and the
                                  .
Object is a common noun , Obj ect marking i s optional even where the referent of
the NP is both human and overtly definite .
     ( 16 )   yen topor t a l e y i k i y r y i pke d a - k - a

              where did you ge t those two women?
In bitransitive clause s , the I ndirect Obj ect takes Obj ect marking obligatorily .
Indirect Objects are almost invariably Pronouns or Personal Name s . But Common
noun Indirect Obj ects do not have the same freedom to occur unmarked as do
Direct Objects and it was for thi s reason that I recognised the category in 5 . 1 .
I t follows that pronominal Indirect Obj ects wi ll invariably take Obj ect marking .
     ( 17 )   Nam-o yaw ma - kow- ka rev
              IPL-O pig Go-give-PF 3MS
              he has come and given us some pig
S imilarly , I ndirect Objects that are Personal Names always bear Object marking .
     ( 18 )   Kampo- re wa n tawkway da- kow- 0
              Kampo-O lSG tobacco FA-give-p
              I gave Kampo tobacco
What makes it neces sary to recogn ise I ndirect Obj ects as a category is that
they must be marked even when they are Common Nouns .
     ( 19 )   yren - wom-o rom yaw- re da- kow- 0
              chi ld-PL- 0 3PL pig-o FA-give-p
              they gave the pig to the/some chi ldren
Indeed , the Indirect Obj ect must be marked even i f it is lower in empathy than
the Direct Obj ect .
As example ( 2 0a) illustrate s , both the Direct and the Indirect Obj e c t may bear
Obj ect marking .
     ( 20)    (a)   yapo r - re wan Kremp i y - te da- kow- 0
                    man- 0 lSG Kaempiy-o FA-give-p

                  ?I gave the man to Kaempiy
Included in the category of I ndirect Ob jects are both the Recipient NP that
co-occurs with a bitransitive verb and the Benefactive NP that co-occurs with
a verb marked as Benefactive with � Q� .
     (21)     Mey tow- re Kapo l - t a l e - re d - i r k a - kow- 0
              Meytow-o Parisko-woman-O FA-ge t- give-p
              he bought a Parisko woman for Meytow
In those rare situations where a bitransitive verb bears the Benefactive
suffix , all three �b j ect NPs may be marked . The verb � Q� give may not bear
the homophonous Benefactive suffix .

But here if we were to assign the - k - and the - i y to the imperfective circumfix,
the verb would most likely have to be derived from a root with the canonical
form 0, and it i s difficult to see how a O- root could condition the - i y
allomorph of the imperfective suffix . I t seems more probable that l � l Y derives
from the imperfective of l� sit .

                                G RAMMAT I CAL RELAT I ONS AND V E RB CLASS ES5. 1      Gramma t i c a l rel a t i on s
By and large , Awtuw i s a language that depends heavily on pragmatic real-world
considerations in recovering the role and reference of NPs in a sentence . As a
resu l t , the identi ficat ion of grammatical relat ions is not entirely t ransparent .
Case marking alone does not const itute a reliable diagnostic for the
identification of grammat ical relations for three reasons .
( 1 ) Although sub j ects never bear case marking, there are other nouns that may
occur in the c lause that never bear case marking e i ther ( c f . 6 . 1 and 5 . 4 ) .
( 2 ) Obj ect marking is obl i gatory on some di rect obj ects and optional on others
(cf. 6 . 2 ) .
( 3 ) Although indirect obj ects always bear obj ect marking , certain direct
obj ects do so too ( c f . 6 . 2 ) .
Furthermore , a lthough Awtuw ' s basic word order is readily identifiable as verb
fina l , indeed as 50V, as order and other permutations are far too common to
allow word order to be of any value in ident ifying grammatical relations .
It is possibl e , nevertheless , to i solate the three relations on the basis of a
more complicated s tatement of their case marking properties in combination with
other criteria . It is important to be able to identi fy grammatical relations
on formal grounds. and without re ference to verb semantics because the
classif icat ion of verbs in section 5 . 2 relies on the ir abi lity to co-occur with
NPs in various grammatical relations .","[91, 92, 93]"
"
5. 1. 1The subj ect of a c lause has a number of propert ies that distinguish i t
from other grammatical relation s .
( 1 ) Fir s t , a s I mentioned above , the subj ect never bears case marking . But the
complementary nouns that co-occur obligatori ly with the idiomatic composite
verbs discussed in 5 . 4 never do so e i the r . Note that in clauses whose sub j ect
is a pronoun , a personal name , or an NP wi th any determiner or modifier , this
problem does not arise because the noun complement of idiomatic complement
constructions i s always a s ingle common noun .
A s imple subs titution test can distinguish the sub j ect in any clause where
there is a doubt as to its identif icat ion . The complementary noun in an
idiomatic composite construction is lexically specified . So if we substitute
                                                      87
88
an appropriate pronoun coreferential with the noun in question , and the clause
remains acceptable , we can be certain that that noun i s the subj ect of the
c laus e , I f such a substitution results in a n unacceptable c l ause , then w e can
identify the noun as a complementary noun .
     (1)    (a)   yam    yiw   d i - k - i yw ' - ey
                  chi ld water FA- Ip-bathe-Ip
                  a chi ld is bathing
            (b)   rev y i w d i - k - i yw ' - ey
                  3MS water FA-IP-bathe-IP
                  he is bathing
            ( c ) *y�n    rev d i - k - i yw ' - ey
                   child 3MS FA- IP-bathe-IP
                  *chi ld he is bathing
( 2 ) Second , only the subj ect of the clause can trigger person agreement in
those verb forms - Hortative , Imperative , and Debitive - that are marked for
person . As first- and second-person subj ects , where overt , are always
pronominal , and therefore readily identifiable as subjects by the ir lack of
case markin g , I will i l lustrate with the third person form .
     (2)    (a)   yen-e vapor wa n - i re
                  2 SG-O man  DB- feed
                  the man has to feed you
            ( b ) *yen -e wan wa n - i re
                   2SG-O lSG DB- feed
                  *I have to feed you
( 3 ) Third , only dual and plural subj ects can trigger number agreement on the
verb . As number agreement is obligatory with these same three verb forms , I
wi l l again i l lustrate with debitive forms .
      (3)   (a)     y�n - worn ta l e wa n - puye
                    child-PL woman DB- hi t
                    the woman must hi t the chi ldren
                  * the chi ldren mus t hi t the woman
            (b)    yam    t a l e- rn wa n - p uya -rnern
                   chi ld woman-PL DB- hit- PL
                   the women mus t hit the child
                  *the child must hit the woman

                   child-PL Woman-DU DB-Du-hit
                   the two women must hit the chi ldren
                  *the children must hi t the two women
4 . Fourth, Awtuw refers to an antecedent through a variety of ava i lable
strategies . Among these are zero anaphora , an ordinary personal pronoun , an
emphatic pronoun , or an emphatic pronoun in combination with a reflexive
marker . Where the pragmatics of the verb of a second c lause are such that the
sub j ect of the preceding clau se is at least as l ikely to have performed the
action depicted in the second verb as the obj ect , then it w i l l be interpreted
as the antecedent for any of these strategies .
                                                                                               89
      (4)   Yawu r A l t i y - re d u - p u y- e , ( rey ( rey ( y i may ) ) ) d - u pow-ka
            Yawur A ltiy-o FA-hi t-p                 3MS 3MS REFL              FA-flee-PF
            Yawur hi t A ltiy and (Yawur) has run away
But where the pragmatics of the second verb are such that an obj ect of the
first clause is more l ikely to have performed i t than the subj ect , then that
obj ec t will be interpreted as the antecedent of a zero or ordinary personal
pronoun subj ec t in the second clau s e .
      (5)   Yawu r A l t i y - re d u - puy -e , ( rey ) f)ow d i -ye l - e
            Yawur A l tiy-o FA-hi t-p              3MS tear FA-cry-p

            Yawmen gave Awtiy tobacco and he (Awtiy ) has ro l led i t
This provides yet another example o f the importance in Awtuw grammar of real­
world considerations in compar ison to grammatical relation s . But the other two
anaphoric strategies do provide f irm evidence for a category of subj ect . When
the sub j ect of the second c lause is an emphatic pronoun , with or without an
accompanying reflexive marker , the antecedent is invariably interpreted as the
subj ect of the preceding clause , regardless of what pragmatic cons iderations
may seem to d ictate .
      (7)   Yawu r A l t i y- re d u - puy- e , rev - rev ( y i ma y ) f)ow d i -ye l -e
            Yawur A ltiy-o FA-hit-p 3MS- 3 MS REFL                     tear FA-cry-P

            Yawmen gave Awtiy tobacco and he, himself, has ro l led i t
( 5 ) Finally , in direct perception complements , the covert subj ect of the
complement may appear as the direct obj ect of the matrix clause . The obj ec t
         '
of the complement may n o t do so ( c f . 1 0 . 2 . 3 ) .
      (9)   (a)    wan [ Numoy �ye d a - k - rok ra - y - re J d - ayn ' - e
                   l SG Numoy food FA-IP-cook- IP-O            FA-sme ll-p
                   I sme l led Numoy cooking food            (b)    wan N umoY j - re [ ¢ j �ye d a - k - rokra-y- re J d - ay n ' - e

                  *I sme l led food being cooked by Numoy
                   I sme l led the food that Numoy was cooking5 . 1 . 2 When the direct obj ect is a pronoun or a personal name , where it i s
equal i n empathy t o the sub j ect , o r where the referents of the sub j e c t and the
obj ect are equally l ikely to have performed the action depicted in the clause
( see 6 . 1 ) , i t obl igatorily takes obj ect marking (cf . 6 . 2 ) . An indirect obj e ct
takes ob ject marking under all circumstances . So we can identify the common
noun or quantifier direct obj ect of a clause with a pronominal sub j e c t , because
the clause will be acceptable whether the direct obj ect has the object suffix
or not .
90
     (10)   t e y rame ( - re ) d u - p u y ' -a
            3FS man- 0          FA-hit- P
            she hit a man
By the same token , we can identify a common noun indirect object because the
clause will be unacceptable if we remove its object suffix .
     (11)   (a)    tey rame- re t awkway d a - kow- 0
                   3FS man- 0 tobacco FA-give-p
                   she gave a man tobacco
            ( b ) * tey rame t awkway da- kow- 0
                    3FS man tobacco FA-give-p
                  *she gave a man tobacco
But we will need to apply another substitution test to identify pronominal and
personal name direct obj ects in clauses wi th common noun subj ects , in other words ,
where the direct ob j ect is higher in empathy than the subj ect . In such clauses ,
pronominal and personal name direct obj ects take obligatory object marking and
are therefore indi stinguishable from indirect obj ects on formal grounds wi thout
reference to information about the meaning of the verb . We cannot substi tute a
human common noun , because it will nece s sarily be equal to or higher than the
sub j ect in empathy , and therefore still require object marking . Thus we can
substitute a non-human common noun for the pronoun or personal name in que s tion .
If the substituted common noun s t i l l requires ob ject marking , then it must be
an indirect obj ect . If the clause is acceptable whether the substituted common
noun bears object marking or not , then i t i s a direct ob j ect .

Note that ( 1 2b-d) are grammatical whether or not the direct ob ject ( p i y ren in
( 1 2b ) and reye in ( 1 2 c-d ) ) has object marking . But the clause becomes
ungrammatical when the indirect obj ect is unmarked , as il lustrated in ( 1 2e ) .","[93, 94, 95, 96]"
"
3 . 5 . 2 Aside from the various case markers to be discussed i n Chapter 6 , Awtuw
substantives accept two adverbi a l suffixe s , -wo just� a lone and -ye again .
These fol low the substantive immediately and precede any case marking , A l l
substantives accept them with apparently equal felicity and they d o n o t exhibit
differences in form when they occur on personal pronouns . But only -wo , in the
form -wa , may be followed by a case marker , and the only case marker that can
follow i t i s the unmarked form of the obj ect suffix - r e o The following examples

and instrumental/comitative case markers , respectively ( see Chapter 6 ) .
While a number o f the constructions di scussed in this section are , in fact ,
direct object complements , it i s interesting that subj ect complement s , although
marginal , may take - re , as shown in section 10 . 2 . 4 . Relative clauses may also
take this suf fix . It would appear therefore that this case marker has been at
least partially reanalysed a s a subo�dination marker . But since - re retains
its obj e ct-marking function in many case s , I wi l l continue to gloss it as such .
There i s no convincing evidence that the Instrumental/Comitative suffix has
undergone a similar reana lysi s .
2 . The embedded predications discussed i n the subsequent sections may , l ike
most constituents of an Awtuw clause , occur clause initially or final ly , a s
we l l a s clause medially . For the most part , I wil l exemplify only the c lause
medial construction , but I will insert il lustrative example s of these
constituents in other positions from time to time .
3 . Many o f these constructions allow the expression o f the subj ect of the
embedded predicate with possessive marking . Wherever this is possible , I
mention it exp l icitly and exemp l i fy the phenomenon .","[162, 163]"

In this construction , the verb marked wi th - re may bear any tense marke r and
may carry a full set o f arguments and adj uncts . This strategy has three maj or
functions . It is used for inferential perception complements , for indirect
discourse complements , and for indirect cognition complements .
Whatever the semantic function , c lauses of this sort have in common the feature
that the tense of the complement is relative to the tense of the matrix verb .
Thus , if the matrix verb i s present , i . e . unmarked, then an unma rked complement
verb re fers to an event contemporaneous with the speech event , a past
complement verb to an event prior to it, and a future complement verb to an
event subsequent to it .

Simi larly , i f the matrix verb i s past , then an unmarked complement verb re fers
to a contemporaneous event , a past complement verb to a prior event , and a
future complement verb to a subsequent event .

And if the matrix verb is future , then the tense marking of the complement verb
again refers to time with relation to the time of the matrix verb .

A perfect form in the complement has much the same semantic e f fect as a pe r fect
form in an independent clause . In the latter case it may refer to an event
completed prior to the speech event , in the former , to an event completed prior
to the time indicated by the tense of the complement verb , which is determined
in turn by the tense of the matrix verb .
In example ( 3 4 ) each perfect complement verb indicates that the baking is
complete at the time referred to by the tense . So in ( 3 4a ) , the unmarke d
tense of the complement verb refers to a time contemporaneous with the time
of �� � say .  In ( 34b) , the past tense of the l ! �� r bake refers to a time prior
to the time of the matrix verb , and the perfect indicates that the baking was
completed at that time . And in example ( 34c ) , the perfect of the complement
verb indicates that the baking will be complete at the time referred to by the
future .

The same kinds of interpretation app ly to complements of matrix verbs in other
tense s . The glosses i n example ( 3 5 ) are not precisely equivalent to the Awtuw
they g loss . Example ( 3 5a ) means that they will have finished baking the pig at
a t ime subsequent to the time he said it, which i s o f course prior to the time
of the speech event . Example ( 35b ) means that at some time before he says it ,
they will have finished baking the pig .

As is common in comparable constructions in other languages , there is also a
relativity of person in the complement, because the narrator relates the act
of perception , speech , or cognition from his or her own point o f view . So , for
example , i f Takiy utters the sentence in example ( 3 6 ) to Yawur , Yawur would
report the speech to Napeyre as in example [ 36a J and to Takiy as in example
[ 36b J .
      ( 36 ) ' wa n Napey re - t e tawkway kow- re '
               lSG Napeyre-o tobacco give-Fu
             'I ' l l give Napeyre some tobacco '

1 . Perception verbs take this type o f complement in the sense that the
perception enables the subj ect to infer the situation depicted by the
complement . Thus Kampo in example ( 3 7 ) did not actua l ly observe his father
going , but his observations enabled him to surmise that his father had gone .
      (37)     Kampo rey- rey - ke I)awa r d - a3y - ka y -e- re d - uwp -o
               Kampo 3MS-3MS-PS father FA-gO-PF- p-o FA-see-p
               Kampo saw that his father had gone
2 . The two speech verbs also take this construction , as illustrated in the
preceding examples and here in ( 38 ) .
      ( 38 )   wan ( Nay tow- re ) Yawu r ma3W - e d - a3y-e - re da-mak-e
               lSG (Nay tow- ) Yawur bush-L FA-go-P-O FA-say-p
               I to ld (Nay tow) whether Yawur went to the bush
The interpretation of the complement is as indirect speech - the speaker merely
reports the narrated speech event , and does not attempt to reproduce it .
                                                                                                        163
3. Al l the cognition verbs , including the preference verbs , can enter into this
construction .
         ( 39 )   t e y Awt i y Treyp i l - e w- ewr ' - eya- re- re nenren d i - k - l ay - e y - e
                  3 F S Awtiy Ta lbipi-L NF-AGN- come-FU-O thought FA- IP-bear- IP-p
                  she Was thinking that Awtiy would return from Ta lbipi
Complements of this type often occur sentence f inally with the ir subj ect
appearing as the direct obj ect o f the matrix verb . Perception and cognition
verbs can take this construc tion , pre ference and speech verbs do not .

                        *he said that Numoy went to Lumi
This construction does not permit the complement subj ect to occur as a
posse ss ive pronoun .

Awtuw uses a superficially simi lar strategy t o form cause and result clause s .
The se c lauses may also have obj ect marking on the verb and pos sess ive marking
on the embedded subj ect . But their subj ects never occur as the direct obj ect
of the matrix verb and the tense of the embedded clause i s not relative to the
tense of the matrix clause .

10. 2 . 7   Rel a t i ve c l a u s e s
Relative clauses have much the same structure as the complements discus sed in
the preceding paragraphs . Relative clauses typically occur between a
determiner and a noun , and while there is no restriction on the ir tense , the
most common relative clauses are those with an imperfective verb unmarked for
tense a s in example (44a ) .
        ( 44 )   (a)     rev k i 1  d a - k - a l ow- ey - re rame l a kna-kay

Hierarchy except posse ssives ( Keenan and Comrie 197 7 , 1 9 7 9 ) . Examples ( 4 4 a ) and
( 44 c ) i l lustrate relativi sation on a subj ect , and ( 4 4b ) , on a source of getting

                   the house the boys used to s leep in has fal len down
Another strategy leaves a re sumptive pronoun in the relative c lause . This
strategy relativises all positions on the Hierarchy including posse s s ives , a s
shown in example ( 4 6 ) .

             the man whose dog bit me has died
In yet another strategy , the head noun takes case marking appropriate to its
role in the relative clause . Thi s construction can also relativise a l l
positions except posse ssives .
     (47 )   (a)   tey Yawu r ffiwre d - u y - kow- kay- re ta l e - re w- eya- re

                   the axe I fe l led the tree with is very sharp
It is possible to summarise the attributes of the three constructions in terms
of two principles :
     1 . A resumptive pronoun must carry possessive marking when relativising
         on a possessive NP .

The head noun of any relative clause may occupy any syntactic pos i tion in the

10. 3    Adverb i a l construct i o n s
An  adverbial construction marks the verb o f the embedded clause with the
instrumental/comitative suffix - re - k . The verb in such a c lause se lects a l l
verbal categories but tense a n d il locutionary force independently o f the matrix
c lause and has its own set of arguments and adj uncts . Its tense is relative to
the tense of the matrix verb .
The subject of a verb marked as instrumental may appear with pos se s s ive
marking .

Sequence of tense s in this construction is quite different from the sequence of
tenses described above in section 10 . 2 . 5 . Here an embedded verb must either
bear the same tense marker as the matrix verb , or no tense marking at all .
A matrix verb o f any tense may embed a verb unmarked for tense .

embed a past form.

As I mentioned in section 4 . 12 , Awtuw ' s abi lity to code a variety of a spectual
and adverbial categories in compounding roots and elsewhere in the verb comp lex
compensate s for its lack of conj unctions . The se categor ies , along with regular
a spe ct marking and the adverbial prefixes in slots -5 and -4 , make it pos s ible
to form a wide variety of temporal c lause s .
An embedded clause with imperfective marking is typically interpreted as a
whi le-c lause . The adverbial pre f i x t aw- sti l l can reinforce this
interpretation .

An imperfective matrix verb and an embedded perfect verb result in a structure
analogous to an un ti l-clause . This interpretation is strengthened by the
addition of the compounding root !�� - begin to the matrix verb .

And an embedded past verb combines with an �y serialisation ( see 10 . 1 . 2 ) with
perfect marking to form a since-clause .

10 . 4   C o nd i t i o n a l construct i o n s
Awtuw has two types o f conditional sentence s . Future conditionals have verbs
marked for future in both the protasis and the apodosis , as in ( 6 1 ) , and
contrafactual conditionals have verbs marked as conditional in both c lauses , a s
in ( 6 0 ) and ( 6 2 ) . In e i ther case , there i s a strict constraint that the two
inte rdependent clause s bear the same marking for tense and modality, although
each verb selects aspect , direction , and negative marking independently .
Moreove r , each verb carries an independent set of arguments and adj uncts .

10 . 5   Co-ordi na ted c l a u s e s
In addition t o the various seriali sation and subordination strategies described
in the preceding sections , Awtuw can concatenate fully independent c lauses .
One such clause is never embedded in the othe r , nor may either clause bear case
marking . Each clause is always entirely acceptable on its own .
Unl ike the previously described strategies , where the tense of the verb in one
c lause was dependent upon the tense of the other - either determined by the
construction , or re lative to the time of the matrix verb , the tense of each
c lause in co-ordinate constructions is independent of the other . The tense of
every verb has absolute time reference .
Furthermore , the clauses in these constructions are independent with respect to
i l l ocutionary force . One c lause may be in a debitive or potential modal i ty ,
or be a question , while the other i s not .

Direct discourse clauses fol low a speech verb and one of the ( ( t ) e y ) ( pek ) ( wo )
adverbs thus . Unlike indirect di scourse complements , they never take case
marking or occur clause medial ly . Tense and pe rson are not relative to the
tense and person in the matrix clause .

In any o f the constructions discussed above that d o not entai l spe c i f ic
co-re ference constraints , the possibility of confusion arise s . Awtuw
compensates for this in large measure pragmatically by interpreting the
antecedent of a deleted NP as the most plausible NP available .

                Kampo Poy tin-o FA-hit- P tear FA-Cry- P
                Kamp o h i t Poytin and she cried
In this case the antecedent of the mis sing NP in the second c lause is
inte rpreted as the obj ect o f the first - Poytin got hit , so she must be the
one who cried .
When two or more NPs are equally l ikely candidates for the role of antecedent
of a de leted NP , the default interpretation is that it is the subject of the
preceding clause .

them in full along with a gloss , the plural form , and the form used for
re lations to other than the speaker , if any . Figure 11 . 1 i l lustrates the
denotation of most of these terms for the most direct l ink to a male ego .
Note that a triangle in Figures 1 1 . 1-6 represents a male and a c ircle , a female .
A c ircle within a triangle represents a person of either sex and a triangle
within a circle , a person of the opposite sex to the person represented by a
c ircle within a triangle . An affine to whom the name taboo ( see below) applies
i s represented by a shaded c ircle or triangle .

Othe rwise , constituents in a WH -que stion have the same freedom of order as they
do in other types of c lauses . In particular, there is no requirement , though
there may be a slight tendency , for the interrogative to occur clause initially .

Awtuw has two basic negation strategie s . The negative prefix ka - / kiIl- may f i l l
the f i r s t s lot in the verb complex t o negate any verbal predicate . And the
negative particle y e n e may negate any constituent , inc luding a predicate
nominal or adj ective , a verb , or even a negative verb , that it precede s .
146
There are also two special portmanteau morpheme s that code the negatives of the
second and third person debitive modal ities , the Prohibitive pre f ix (PR) a p ­
and the Negative Debitive ( NDB ) prefix n i l - , respective ly . The se are discussed

Certain verbs allow re flexiv isation to take place . Only patients , recipients ,

two re flexivisers y i ma y and ye l ow , must always fol low the reduplicated form of
a pronoun co-referential with the subj ect . They take Obj ect marking optionally .

148
The ye l ow/y i ma y reflexive construction has a very low functional load - there
are no examples whatsoever in the corpus of narrative I have collecte d . This
is in part because in many of the cases where one might expect frequent
reflexivisation , for example with a verb l ike �QrY� wash , the reflexive is
lexical ised , in this ins tance by y i w l Y�� water bathe .

                     Wayekaw has bathed
Another factor contributing to the low frequency of such re flexives is that in
benefactive constructions where one could conceivably occur , the benefactive NP
is more l ikely to surface as a posse s sive .

9.4   Foc u s i ng
Although constituent order within a clause carries no information about the
case roles of the nomina l constituents , neither does it appear to bear
information about the relative focus of the various constituents . The two most
common methods of focusing a constituent are sentence stre ss and the particle
po , usually used in concert with each other .","[153, 154]"

               our (two ) skin is cold
A more complex embe llishment of the Ascriptive predication has the unusual
feature of the posse ssor of the body part appearing as an Obj e ct . As example
( 7 ) shows , such constructions may also have peripheral NP s , in this case , a
Locative NP .

              we two were cold in the piver
A semantically similar type of predication has the posse s sor of the body part
unmarked for case . This makes ana lysis ambiguous . We could analyse the
unmarked possessor as the subject and the noun and adj ective as constituents of
a single NP in a classificatory predication (cf . 8 . 4 . 1 ) . But I bel ieve that it
i s pre ferable to analyse the adjective alone as an ascriptive predicate whose
sub j ect is the body part . This leaves the syntactic function of the unmarked
possessor in some doubt , but unmarked posse ssors are common in constructions
with �� ��y ( c f . 5 . 10 ) . Moreove r , the structural and semantic para lle l between

8 . 3 . 2 Possessive predications have a possessive NP as the ir predicate . The se
predicate s have the formal property of bearing the Possessive marker - ke and
the semantic property o f identi fying the possessor of the subj ect ( c f . 5 . 9 ) .

8 . 3 . 3 Comparative predications have a comparative NP as their predicate .            They
share the formal property of bearing the Comparative marker - kwo and the
semantic property of comparing their sub j e c t to a standard of comparison .

10. 2 . 2    Fu ture compl ement c o n s truc t i o n s
The first three constructions we w i l l b e examining require a verb with future
marking in the nominal clause . These constructions express desire or lack o f
de sire t o d o something , remembering or forgetting to do something , asking o r
tell ing someone t o d o some thing , and purpose . I n each case , the future -marked
verb depicts an action that must take place after the situation depicted by the
matrix verb . This make s the future marking seem semantically natural .
1 . In one o f the se , the covert subj ect o f the nominal clause must be
co-re ferential with the subj ect of the matrix c lause . Although Awtuw lacks an
infinitive form , this bears a close resemblance to an infinitive construction .
In thi s construction , the future verb functions as the complement o f the othe r
verb , as s ignalled by the Obj ect suffix. The Obj e ct-marked verb may have an
obj ect of its own , but it has no overt subj ect as it is neces sarily
co-re ferential with the subj ect of the other verb.
There is a l imited class of roots that can occur as the matrix verb in this
construction , speci fically , a subset of the cognition verbs . This class
include s the two preference verbs , rewrey l � � like and ���� don ' t like, don ' t
want when they mean like/want to and not like/want to .
        ( 15 )   Ka3mp i y l a pe-  ke w- i k i y - re - re d e - yaw ' - 0                 Kaempiy vi l lage- L NF-s tay-F- 0 FA-not want-p
                 Xaempiy doesn ' t want/like to stay in the vi l lage
The two memory verbs mane � r �� � (ear) forget and nenren -e �� � (hold in thought )
remember enter into this construction when they mean remember/forget to.
        ( 16 )   (a)   wan reye    r a - re- re mane d - a rney- kay
                       l SG food eat-FU-O ear FA-forget-PF

                      I ' ve forgotten to eat
Awtuw uses the same construction to express purpose when the embedded subject
is co-referential with the matrix sub j e c t . I n this construction the matrix
verb may be any root and the embedded verb bears future marking and the obj ect
suffix .
      ( 17)    A l t i y Kuk rown - t a k i l w - a l ow- kow- re- r e Wu t l a kw-o d - rey - e
               A ltiy Kukrown-o speech NF-speak-BEN-Fu-o Gutaiye -L FA-go-P
               A ltiy went to Gutaiye to speak to Kukrown
A variant of this construction al lows ffiWrey l � Y like, want to take an obj ect­
marked future complement whose subject is a possessive NP co-referential with
the matrix subject .
      ( 18 )   R uwmay rey - rey - ke w- rey - re - re ffiWrey l ay - ka y
               Ruwmay 3MS- 3MS-PS NF-go-FU-O U �                      W
               Ruwmay likes to go
2 . In the second construction , the covert subj ect of the obj ect-marked future
verb is obligatorily co-referential with the indirect obj e ct of the matrix verb .
Again , only a limited class of predicates may take this construction . This
class inc ludes the two speech verbs Y� � �� ask and �� � te l l when they mean ask
to and te l l to.
      ( 19 )   (a)    Yawu r rey-e L i wm i y - e w- rey- re - re da-ma k ' -e
                      Yawur 3MS-O Lumi- L NF-gO-FU-O FA-te ll-p
                      Yawur told him to go to Lumi
               (b)    Yaw u r r ey - e da-ma k ' - e L i wm i y-e w- rey - re ( - re )
                      Yawur 3MS-O FA-te l l- p Lumi- L NF-go-FU- 0
                      Yawur to ld him to go to Lumi
Note that the indirect obj ect of the matrix clause can not intervene be tween
L i wm i ye and w�y r e re .
      [ 19 J *Yaw u r L i wm i y - e rey-e w- rey - re- re d -mak ' -e
              Yawur Lumi- L 3MS-O NF-go-FU-O FA-te l l-p
              Yawur told him to go to Lumi
The preference verbs can also participate in this construction .
      (20)     Awt i y N umoy - re rewrey l ay - k a y L i wm i y-e w- rey- re - re
               Awtiy Numoy-o want bear-PF Lumi- L NF-gO- FU-O
               Awtiy wants Numoy to go to Lumi
3 . Fina l ly , purpose clause s , like the purpose structures described above ,
a lways have a verb in the future . In this construction , however , there are
no co-re ference restrictions .
      (21)     wa n Ma l a y manman ka- r e- re yen-e y uk uwt da- kow- kay

10 . 2 . 3   Imperfec t i ve c ompl ement constructi o n s
Two types o f complements require a n imperfective form . In one case , the
imperfective verb depicts a skil l that is known , not known , or taught . In the
other , it depicts a situation that i s perceived directly while it i s going on .
The imperfective form i s semantically we ll-suited to such imperfective
situations .
1 . The first type al lows the two knowledge quasi-verbs neknek know and a re n e
                                                           ------
don ' t know to occur in the meaning (no t ) know how to .
        (23)     (a)    A l t i y - wo take   da-k- r ' -   ey- re neknek
                        A l tiy-only bow stop FA- I P-plait-IP-O know
                        only A ltiy knows how to p lait bow s tops
                 (b)    A l t i y-wo neknek t a ke   da-k- r ' -     ey { - re }
                        A l tiy-only know   bow stop FA- IP-p lai t- IP- 0
                        only A ltiy knows how to p lait bow stops
The verb l�mgl�� teach, show also takes this construction .
        (24)     Kukrown wa n - e y i l mre t d a - k- n a k - ey - re d - i yma l ey - e
                 Kukrown lSG-O string FA- IP-ho ld- IP-o FA-teach- P
                 Kukrown taught me to make string figures
2 . Direct perception complements have the ir verbs in the imper fective with
obj ect marking and thei r covert subj ects are co-referential with the matrix
direct obj ect . The perception verbs that take such complements are wan hear ,
gYQ� sme l l , and 2� e � see.        (25)     wan N u moy - re mye d a - k - rok r a - y - re d - ayn ' - e
                 lSG Numoy-o food FA- IP-cook- IP-O FA-sme l l-p
                 I sme l led Numoy cooking food
It is not pos sible for the matrix obj ect to re fer to the obj ect of the embedded
verb in this construction . Example ( 2 6a) , while grammatical , exemplifies not a
direct perception complement , but a relative c lause . Note that it is pos s ible
to insert a perfect verb form , which is not a feature o f this construction , in
( 26b) . Example ( 26c ) shows that an unambiguous relative clause construction is
synonymous with ( 26a) .
        ( 26 )   (a)    wan mye- r e N umoy d a - k - rok r a - y - r e d - a y n ' - e
                        lSG food- o Numoy FA- IP-cook- IP-O FA-sme l l-p
                        I sme lled the food that Numoy was cooking
                 (b)    wan reye - re N umoy rok ra- kay- re d - ayn ' - e
                        lSG food-o Numoy cook- PF- 0 FA-sme Z l-p
                        I sme Z led the food that Numoy had cooked
                 (c)    wan Numoy d a - k - rok r a - y - re mye - re d- a y n ' - e
                        l S G Numoy FA- IP-cook- I P-O food-o FA-sme l l-p
                        I sme l led the food that Numoy was cooking
When the complement subject is overt , it occurs as a pos sess ive pronoun
co-re ferential with the matrix direct obj ect .
        (27)     Os i y Tak i y- re d - uwp - o r e y - ke mye d a - k - rok r a - y - re
                 Osiy Takiy-o FA-see-p 3MS-PS food FA- IP-cook- IP-O
                 Osiy saw Takiy cooking food
160
Perception verbs can also take direct perception complements whose subject is
marked as posses sive . In this case , the complement itse l f serves a s the unique
direct object of the matrix clause .
        ( 28 )    (a)   Os i y Tak i y rey-ke ffiye d a - k - r o k r a - y - r e d - uwp - o
                        Osiy Takiy 3MS-PS food FA- IP-cook- I P - O FA-see-P
                        Osiy saw Takiy 's cooking food
                  (b)   O s i y T a k i y d- uwp -o r ey - ke ffiye d a - k - r o k ra - y ( - re )
                        Osiy Takiy FA-see-p 3MS-PS food FA-IP-cook- IP-O
                        Osiy saw Takiy 's cooking food
10. 2 . 4    Subj ect c ompl emen ts
Sub j ect complements , which are unusual in Awtuw , and whose predicate may only
be a predicate NP or adj ective phrase , also have an impe rfective verb form that
may be marked with - re o
A nominal construction with an imperfective verb form may function a s the
subj ect of certain types of verble ss predication . This construction occurs
very infrequently .
        ( 29)     (a)   Poy t i n a n ta n te �ow d i - k - ye l -e y ( - re ) monokene vapor
                        Poytin a lways tear FA- IP-cry- IP- 0                  bad      very
                        it 's very bad that Poy tin a UJays cries
                  (b)   ffiy      d a - k - r a - y ( - re ) wan - ke l a ke
                        bete lnut FA- IP-eat- IP-O           lSG-PS bone
                        chewing bete lnut is my thing
It is surpri sing that the only available strategy for forming subj ect
complements can accept obj ect marking . It would appear that - re has become
partly general ised as a marker of subordination and that on those rare
occasions when called upon to produce a sub j ect complement , Awtuw speake rs are
therefore inclined to mark the clause with the subordination marker .","[163, 164, 165, 166]"
"
2.2   Mo rphophono l o gy
This section presents a number of ordered rules which together produce most o f
the phonetic forms of Awtuw words from strings of morphemes .
On the whole , the rules apply to verb forms , but where other types of words
meet the environmental criteri a , these rules affect them as wel l . The only
cases o f such rules are one of the vowel harmony rules ( 2 . 2 . 10) , which changes
the canonical lei of the past , future , and obj ect suf f ixes to lrJ or [�J, and
the pre-rhotic stop insertion rule in 2 . 2 . 18 .
                                                                                               17
The rules are ordered and must apply sequentially . This i s particularly
important in the case of the vowel harmony ru les that affect the qual ity of the
Imperfective and Past suffixes ( 2 . 2 . 7 and 2 . 2 . 1 0) . Although nearly identical
in form, one must apply before , and the other after , the e l i sion rule ( 2 . 2 . 9 ) .
with the exception of the vowel gradation rule ( 2 . 2 . 2 0 ) , I have used the
traditional forma l i sms of Generative Phonology to capture the rules conc i sely .
But as I mentioned in Sect ion 1 . 1 . 4 , I do not mean to imply any credence in the
claims of the theory . The formalism mere ly represents a convention to
schematise morphophonological rule s .
Among the formal i sms I have adopted is the labe lled angle bracket notation
(Chomsky and Halle 1 968 : 394-395) . This convention , suggested to me by Avery
Andrews , permits parts of the environment for a rule to be keyed to the
presence or absence of a feature . The benefit of this forma l i sm is that a
single process with a complex environment can be represented as a single ru le ,
in conformity with the intuitive j udgement that the process is unitary in spite
of the complexity of its environment .
Features enclosed in label l ed angle brackets are interpreted as relevant parts
of the environment if the label is [+J, and are ignored when the label is [-J.
Greek letter values are multiplied by any operator on them . Thus , an angle
bracket labe l led [aJ has the same value as some f eature specified [aJ. But an
angle bracket label led [-aJ has the oppos i te value from the f eature spec ified
as [aJ. In example ( 2a ) , the feature F2 is a re levant part of the environment
when Fl is spec ified as [ + J , and irre levant when Fl is speci f ied as [-J. In
example ( 2b) , F2 is relevant when Fl is [-J, and irrelevant when Fl is [+J .
         (2)     (a)     [aFIJ
                         <ex[ +F2 J>
                 (b)     [aFIJ
                         <-ex[ +F2 J>
Thus , the environment in ( 2a) wi l l be read as either [ -FI J , or [ +F l , +F 2 J , and
( 2b) will be read as e ither [ +FI J , or [ -Fl , +F2 J .
I present each rule in a separate subsection , so references to , e . g . Rule 3 ,
refer to the rule presented i n subsection 2 . 2 . 3 . Note that this type of
analysis produces intermediate forms that are neither phonemic nor phonetic
( c f . Chomsky and Halle 1968 : 65 ) . I enclose all non-phonemic forms in square
brackets ([ . . . J) .

The first rule deletes / k / after a consonant and a morpheme boundary and before
another /k/ and a word boundary . Thi s transforms the conditional suffix / k k /
into / k / after a consonant-f inal stem when there is n o desiderative suffix .
         / ro k r a - k k /          [ rok r a - k k J          would have cooked

The rule also deletes / k / after any unstressed vowe l , any consonant , and a
morpheme boundary and before another / k/ , which s implifies the conditional
suffix after a k - final stem.

8 . 4 . 1 Predicate s that consist of a quantifier NP have two functions . Those
that occur wi thout a subj ect predicate the exi stence of that NP and those that
occur with a subject denote possession of the predicate by the subject . I n
e i ther case , this type of predication appears t o arise from the deletion o f
a verb . Where the quantifier is awt uw none , the deleted verb i s r Q �� do , and
if the quanti f ier is not awtuw, then the deleted verb is �� � � y exist ( c f . 5 . 1 0 ) .

8 . 4 . 2 Unquantified NP predicate s fall into two further subclasses depending
upon whethe r the NP is de finite or not .
The former class equates the subj ect with the predicate and I cal l such
predicates Equative predicates .

Because of the semantic nature o f this type of predication , the role s of
sub j ect and predicate are interchangeable , as illustrated in ( 15a) and ( 15b ) .
The other subc las s , whose predicate consists of an inde finite NP , ha s the
semantic property of a ssigning its subj ect to a class , so I label these
Classificatory predications .

8.6   Word o rder i n verbl e s s predi cati ons
The word order in verbless c lauses is far more rigid than in othe r type s of
predication s . Most types of verble s s predications do not permit variation of
word order , a s shown in examples ( 20a-e ) .
      ( 20 )    ( a ) '�y i pe fJa mey                (cf. (1) )

Because of the nature of the equative relation , the subject and predicate of an
Equative clause are interchangeable . Posses sive and Comparative predicates may
precede the ir subj ects with a change in intonation , as in examples ( 20 f ) and
( 20g)     .
                    (f)   wan-wa n - k e tade r p i y ren      (cL ( 15 ) )

8.7  Com p l ement-ta k i ng verbl e s s pred i ca t i o ns
There i s one final predication type that bears some resemblance to some of the
Idiomatic Composite constructions described above ( c f . 5 . 9 ) , on the one hand ,
and to the verble ss body part constructions ( c f . 8 . 3 . 1 ) , on the othe r . All
such predicates denote Cognitive state s .","[143, 144, 145, 146]"

1 . 2 . 4 The people of the region largely subsist in an economy dominated by
sago production . Sago is at once the staple of their diet and their f avourite
food ( c f . Wark and Malcolm 1969) . Moreover , sago fronds trep are used for
thatch and the stalks of these fronds , madow (TP mo ra i ta ) , are used in the
construction of wall s , doors , and beds .
The sago diet is supplemented by a small amount of garden produce - mainly
n i yame l yam, t a l ow taro , wom coconut , and amak pandanus-and occasional game ,
fish , or domestic pig.
All gardening and hunting tasks fall to the men , whi le sago production is the
exclusive domain of women . The men clear their gardens by burning them off and
hunt with r i py ' - a l me bows and arrows or shotguns .
Awtuw-speakers , like most of their countrymen , are inveterate chewers of �y
bete lnut and smokers of t awkway tobacco. The gardens of the Awtuw-speaking
vil lages produce more betelnut , tobacco , and rep i t daka pepper than the people
require , and the main source of cash income derives from the sale of these
commodi ties at the weekly market in Lumi . In the two southernmost vil lages ,
Tupum and Kalaktuw , where game is more plentiful , meat and occas ional ly
kat i ok+wa te wi ldfowl eggs , or even re l rewye +wa te crocodi le eggs are brought to
market.
Throughout the area , settlement is in small villages , most of them consisting
of a cluster of smaller hamlets , with populations of between five and 50 . Each
hamlet generally consists of two paral lel lines of houses , with more houses at
either end , all facing into a cleared central area . In some cases , houses or
sma l l patches of garden may intrude into the centre of the hamlet . In hamlets
occupied by more than one lineage , the members of each lineage tend to l ive in
adj acent houses .
Houses themse lve s are invariably built o f madow and thatched with trep . Some
are bui lt on the ground and others are rai sed on stilts of y i y l e ka l kwi la
wood . The f loors of rai sed houses are made of wud p i r (TP l i ""mbum) b lack palm.
More e laborate housing involves the use of p l a ym mats of woven, flattened
                                                                                     7
bamboo in walls and occasionally windows . The typical house i s between five
and eight metres square , with a door at either end and no windows . The area
between the two doors is c lear , and between two and three small ' rooms ' flank
this corridor on either side . The rooms are separated by wal l s of madow about
1 . 5 metres high and each contains two parallel benches of madow set perpendicu­
lar to the s ide wal l s of the house . The benches are about 50 cm high and wide
and between 150 cm and 200 cm long . Between each pair of benches is a cleared
area about one metre wide where a fire may be bui l t .
Generally , a nuclear fami ly , consisting of a married couple , their unmarried
daughters and sma l l sons , and sometimes the husband ' s widowed parent , wi l l
occupy each house. Boys move into a separate house with their age-mates at
about the age of ten and remain in such a household unti l they marry , between
the ages of about 25 and 3 0 , when they build their own houses and establish
thei r own households in the husband ' s hamlet .
The spouses share the housework and care of chi ldren . Men usually undertake
such tasks as cutting grass , while the women sweep out the house and collect
firewood and water . Men cook all meat and most garden crops , and the women
take on responsibili ty for preparing most of the sago .
The speakers of the ma jority dialect of Awtuw ( see 1 . 3 ) share most cultural
traits with their Torricelli language speaking neighbour s to the west , north ,
and eas t . The speakers of the southern dialect are much more c losely
affiliated with their neighbours to the south . The dialect boundary that
segregates the people of Kamlakw, Wutlakw , and Wiyup from those of Kalaktuw and
Tupum is also the southern limit of the �a l e-wokaw Devi lfish ceremony .
On the other hand , the restriction on game consumption defines a cultural
continuum stretching from the Sepik River a long the Yellow and Wiytape Sibi
Rivers up into the highest vil lages in the Torricell i s . At the southern end of
the continuum , the restriction on consuming the game one shoots extends to all
members of the hunter ' s patril ine and his wife . In the Awtuw- speaking area ,
only the hunter , his father , brothers , and sons may not eat his game . Further
north , only the hunter himself is restricted from eating his game . Still
further along , the hunter may eat his own game . This continuum corresponds ,
perhaps coincidentally , with the density of settlement and concomitant scarc ity
of game .
The three villages that speak the maj ority dialect of Awtuw are distinct from
any of their neighbours with respect to certain cultural traits . For example ,
in this area , people do not eat dog meat , on which there is no restriction in
the surrounding area . Women and chi ldren in these vil lages do not eat fresh
fish .
As I mentioned above , the �a l e -wokaw ceremony , ce lebrated throughout the Wapei
area , stretches only as far south as Wiyup . The other two maj or ceremonies , the
wokaw Malangan and kepne TUmbuan , encompass the entire area . All of these
ceremonies , as wel l as the minor ceremonies that are restricted to a locality ,
are closely involved with therapeusi s . Although these ceremonies have a
variety of politica l , economic , artistic , mu sical , and religious funct ions , the
explicit motivation for performing any ceremony is always diseas e . performing
the appropriate ceremony propitiates the spirit responsible for causing the
disease , who then removes it .

1.3   Soc i o l i ng u i s t i c s
The Sepik region as a whole , and the Lumi District i n particu lar , are
l inguistically very diverse ( Laycock 1968 , 197 3 ) . Of the roughly 3 0 , 000
inhabitants of the District , over 10 , 000 are speakers of 010, a Torricelli
Phylum language with over 1 5 , 000 speakers , some of them in other administrative
area s . The remaining 2 0 , 000 people speak 2 1 other language s . With 400
speakers , Awtuw i s larger than many of the surrounding languages .
Such diversity , combined with a general rule of local exogamy , engenders a
re latively astounding degree of multilingualism. Typically , an 010 speaker
married to another 010 speaker will speak only 010 and Tok P i s in . But speakers
of any of the smal ler languages will usua lly speak 010 and Tok P i s in , in
add ition to their f irst language . I f an individual ' s parents speak different
language s , he or she is l ikely to speak at least four . Husbands who do not
speak the ir wife ' s language usually learn it , and wives who do not speak their
husband ' s language always do . People with relations or other contacts further
afield commonly speak as many as seven or eight languages .
Children in the Awtuw-speaking area start to learn Awtuw and Tok Pisin at the
same time . By the age of three or four they express themselves more comfortably
in Awtuw , but they become genuinely f luent in Tok Pisin by the age of f ive ,
whi l e it may take another three to five years to master Awtuw entire ly . By
that time the child will have also learned a modicum of 010 and of other
languages that he or she comes into contact with .
Because Awtuw-speaking women marry into villages that do not speak Awtuw , there
are a number of Awtuw speakers outside the five v i l lages . Naturally , such
Awtuw-speaking women continue to speak Awtuw themselves and the ir chi ldren a lso
speak Awtuw . What strikes one as interesting is that their husbands usual ly
learn it as wel l . That adults continue to learn Awtuw as a second language
indicates that the language remains vital and is likely to continue to thrive .
There are Awtuw- speaking populations in the fol lowing villages ( see Map 1 ) :                                Tab l e 1 . 2 : V i l l a ges wi th Awtuw s peakers                              VILLAGE         (TOK PISIN NAME )           LANGUAGE

As I mentioned above , Awtuw , a lthough it has so few speakers , has more than one
dialect . In fact , there are three - the Southern diale c t , the Witit dialect ,
and the maj ority dialect that I describe in this grammar . The Southern dialect ,
spoken in the two southernmost v i l lage s , Kalaktuw and Tupum , has two very
distinct phonological features . First , it has completely neutralised the
distinction made in the maj ority dialect between I rl and III in favour of the
I l l . And second , it has replaced the word- initial I Q I of the major ity dialect
with 1 7 / . Thus I r a re re l want to eat in the maj ority dialect is I l a l e l el in the
Southern dialec t , and IQa l e l fish becomes 1 7 a l e/ .
The witit dialect i s spoken by only one l i neage i n the hamlet o f Witi tlape in
Kamlakw. It is distinguished from the maj ority dialect in replacing word­
initial IQI with In / . Thus I Qalel fish becomes In a l e/ , homophonous with I n a l el
ho Ze .
Interestingly , the neutral isation of I rl and III and of IQI and I n l are two
features of child language as well as the main indicators of dialect
dif ferences.

structure . Its phonology and espec ially its morphophonology are enormously
rich and fully deserve a thorough and comprehensive description . But as I
mentioned in 1 . 1 . 2 , this work is a description of Awtuw grammatical st�ucture
and I have therefore constrained the chapter on phonology to a minimum . The
aim of this chapter is to provide the reader with a brief overview of Awtuw
segmental phonology and some of the major morphophonological rules .","[12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"
9 . 4 . 2 Awtuw uses four other focusing strategie s , a l l o f them much rarer than
po . The simplest of the se is topicali sation , which entails e xtracting the
focused constituent with a pause between the extracted constituent and the rest
of the clause .
     (42)     (a)   Ta k i y , t a d e r rew re d - u y - kay
                    Takiy this house FA-bui ld-PF
                    Takiy, he 's bui lt this house
The top icalised constituent may appear e i ther to the right or to the le ft of
the clause .
              (b)   t a d e r rew r e d - uy - ka y , Ta k i y
Topicali sations may focus direct obj ects , recipients , instruments , or any other
nominal constituent .
     ( 43 )   (al   yekne- re- k , Ke r i y rev taw d - uwk- 0
                    axe- 0- I Keriy 3MS tree FA-fe l l-p
                    with an axe, Keriy fe l led the tree
              (b)   Ke r i y rev taw d - uwk-o , yekne - re - k
     (44)     (a)   Kampo- re , wan rew re d - u y - kow- 0

              (b)   w a n rew r e d - uy - kow-o , Kampo- re
Note that appositiona l intonation over the extracted constituent and the
associated pause , represented here by a comma , are necessary compone nts of thi s
construction . Without the m , the resulting permutation o f word order would have
no particular focusing e ffect .
150
9 . 4 . 3 Dis location di f fers from topicali sation only in that a pronominal copy
of the focused constituent remains behind in the body of the clause .
      (45)     (a)   Peyaw , rey yaw- re d - i y- e
                     Peyaw 3MS pig-o FA-shoot-p
                     Peyaw, he shot a pig
The dis located element may appear to the right or to the left of the clause
from which it was extracted .
               (b)    rey yaw- re d - i y -e , Peyaw
The dis location strategy may be used to focus any nominal constituent , but not
pronominal , adverbial , or verbal constituents .
      (46)     (a)   rey yaw , A l t i y rey-e d - i y - e
                     3MS pig A l tiy 3MS-O FA-shoot-p

9 . 4 . 4 Awtuw forms clefts by extracting a nominal constituent for focus ing from
a c lause , predicating that constituent to a third-person pronoun agreeing with
it in sex and number , and modi fying it with a restrictive re lative clause
formed from the balance o f the original clause .

9 . 4 . 5 F inally , Awtuw can focus constituents by p seudoc le fting . In thi s
construction , a nominal constituent is extracted from the clause , a generic
noun is predicated to it, and that noun heads a re lative clause formed from
the rest of the original clause .

Pseudoclefts with the focused constituent to the le ft do not focus sub j ects .
In pseudoclefts to the right , wh ich may focus any nominal constituent , the
focused e lement appears a lone to the right of the clause a fter a pause , while
the inserted head noun remains on the left .

                               I NTERPRED I CATE A N D I NTERC LAUSAL RELAT I ONSAwtuw displays a wide variety of constructions for re lating predicates . The se
range from the strategy described in section 3 . 7 . 3 and 4 . 14 , which fuses roots
within a single verb complex , to strateg ie s that con join clauses with separate
sets of NPs and complete ly independent speci fication for verbal categories .
This chapter describe s the forma l properties of each construction and re lates
them to the ir semantic functions .
The constructions fall into five di stinct categorie s . Serial isation construc­
t ions concatenate verb roots , verb forms , or verb phrases whose subj ects are
obl igatorily co-referential to code diverse semantic functions ranging from an
increase in valency to a sequence of actions .
Nominal constructions subordinate a verb phrase or a full c lause as a
constituent of an NP per forming a nominal or ad j ectival function. In these
constructions , the tense of the subordinate verb is e ither determined by the
construction or interpreted as relative to the tense of the matrix verb .
Nominal constructions code a variety of relations ranging from so-called psych­
action complements , such as ' remembe r to . . . ' , to cause clause s , inc luding
re lative c lause s .
Adverbial constructions code actions contemporaneous or sequential to the
action coded by the matrix verb . They are formally similar to nominal
constructions in some respect s . But where a nominal clause is marked a s
subordinate with the suffix - re , a n adverbial clause bears the suf fix - rek .
Moreover , the subject of an adverbial clause may not occur as the obj e c t o f
the matrix clause , a s is possible in certain nominal constructions . And an
adverbial clause functions adverbial ly rather than nominally or adj ectivally .
Condi tional constructions j uxtapose two interdependent clause s which must bear
identical future or conditional marking .
Co-ordination constructions j uxtapose two or more entirely independent clauses
to code simultaneous , consecutive , and unspecified re lations among predicate s .","[155, 156, 157, 158]"

6.5   Locat i o n / Di rec t i on
The Location/Direction suffix ( L ) , has the form - k e / - ko / - ka after vowe ls and
- e / - o / - a after consonants . The vowel quality of the suffix is determined by a
vowe l harmony rule described in 2 . 2 . 10 . I t occurs on NPs re ferring to places ,
inc luding Demonstratives , but never on personal pronouns . I t may occur o n an
adj ective or an intens i fier if it is the last word in such a noun phrase , as in
( 3 3d) and ( 3 3 e ) .

The Location/Direction suffix marks the source or the goal of motion , i f it is
a place , . i . e . a place name , a direction , or denotes some physical locality ,
e . g . a house , a road, a river, a part of a house o r a tree , etc . It also marks
the location of a state , process , or action , again provided that the NP refers
to a place . The meaning of the as sociated verb determines the interpretation
of Locative NP as e i ther location or direction , and if direction , whether
from or to . Thus , unless the clause contains a Direction verb , the Locative NP
wil l refer to a location . I f the clause contains the verb �y go , one of the
other Goal verbs ( c f . 5 . 2 ) or a seriali sation with �y , then the Locative NP
wil l refer to a goal . And i f the clause contains the verb �y� come , one of the
other Source verbs ( c f . 5 . 2 ) , or a seriali sation ending in �y� , then the
Locative will be a source . There are a number of ' location ' nouns that commonly
compound with other nouns to make the reference of the Locative more explicit
( c f . 3 . 7 . 2 ) . The fol lowing list includes all such nouns that have come to my
attention .","[119, 120]"

Personal Pronouns and Demonstrative Pronouns , which are freer to determine a
variety of Nominal structures , bear number marking . The Demonst-r atives exhibit
a plural/non-plural distinction and may agree with their referent in number .
If the referent of the Nominal is singular or dual , the Demonstrative must be
unmarked for number , and if the referent of the nominal is plural , the
Demonstrative may bear plural marking .

plural Nominal conditions a plural Personal pronoun in its Determiner , a dua l

The l a s t point I want t o make here with regard t o the Pronouns is the function
of the third person Personal Pronouns . These are by far the most common
determiners in any di scourse . Their function is to mark an NP as definite ,
which accounts for the i r ubiquitousnes s . While definite NPs need not be
dete rmined by such a pronoun , all NPs determined by rev , tey , rrew , or rom are
de finite .","[127, 128, 129, 130]"

7 . 7 . 7 Next we can look at the expansion of the Determiner as the sole
constituent of the NP . At this point it is relevant to mention that there i s
a constraint that prevents a Kinterm from occurring a s the Determiner of any
NP that does not have a Personal name in the Nominal constituent . Furthermore ,
since an NP with a Quantifier as the sole constituent in the Determiner s lot i s
indistinguishable from one with a Quantifier as the sole constituent in the
Quantifier s lot , examples ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) i l lustrate only Pronouns and Possess ives
as expansions of the Determiner .

7 . 2 . 3 We can now turn to the expansions of the NOM given in rule 5 . To begin
with , the NOM may consist of an Adj ective marked with the Generic suffix -yren i m .
Bare adjectives may not occur a s the only constituent of NOM , a s was pointed
out in 3 . 3 .
       (4)   (a)   wokak- yren i m
                   tfl,U- GEN
                   ta U peop le

                   generouS-GEN
                   generous peop le
Next , the NOM may expand to a Place name , as shown in example ( 5 ) .
       (5)   Treyp i l wa r uke
             Talbipi big
             Ta lbipi is big
A Place name may carry the Generic suffix.
       (6)   Wo rke- yren i m d - rey- k a
             Seinim-GEN       RL-gO-PF
             the people from Seinim have gone
A Personal name , with or without number marking , can also fill the NOM s lot .
       (7)   (a)   Awkay d - rey-e
                   Awkay RL-go-P
                   Awkay went
             (b)   A l t i y-wom d - rey-m- e
                   A l tiy-PL RL-gO-PL-P
                   A ltiy-mob went
The NOM can also expand to S ( cf . 10 . 2 ) , which may be any clause , although
there are constraints on its complexity . Example ( 8 ) i llustrates this
structure .
       (8)   (a)   tey wa n - e [ Y awu r d - rey-ka - re ] da-mak-a

                   2SG 3PL-O RL-gO-FU-O            RL-ask- PF
                   have you asked them to go?
                                                                                                         119
  I t can also expand to a Common noun , with or without number marking or an
. Adj ective phrase , as i l lustrated in example ( 9 ) .
        (9)     (a)   t i y l wa r u ke

3.8   Deri vat i o n
Awtuw has three derivational strategies . The suffix - n e ney -Y3 fu l l of3
including3 etc . , mentioned in 3 . 3 . 2 as a distinguishing property of Common
Noun s , derives adj ectives from common nouns . The suffix -wo / - kwo , a lso a
defining cr iter ion for parts-of- speech categories , is less transparently a
derivational suffix , but has the effect of deriving adj ectives from nouns and
other adj ectives , and adverbs from nouns , adj ectives and other adverbs . I n
most contexts , -wo / - kwo corre sponds reasonably neatly i n meaning with the
Engli sh suff ixes - l i ke and - i s h . Finally , the number-marking suffixes -WffiW
DUAL , -wom PLURAL , and - Yffin i m GENERIC , derive words with some of the formal
morphological character istics of persona l pronouns from nouns .",[55]
"
4. 7.3   The next step is to d istingui sh forms specified as Negative from those
specified as non-Negative , for both Debitive and non-Debitive categories . Thi s
feature dist inguishes Negative Debitive forms with the prefixes a p - and ni 1 -
from non-Negative Debitive forms with the pre fixes pa - , k a n - , and wan - . I t
also distinguishes among non-Debitive , non-Potential forms . Again , the
position of the pre fixes that mark the categories make Potential and Negative
mutua l ly exclus ive .
Thi s leaves a three-way distinction among Potential forms with the pre f ix n a - ,
Negative non-Potential forms with the pref ix ka - , and non-Negative non-Potential
forms with no pre f ix in s lot - 8 . The morpho logical and semantic unmarkedness
of the non-Negative non-Potential j u stif ies naming the feature Negative rather
than Affirmative .
An i llustrative diagram at this point may serve to c larify the distinctions
proposed thus far .                                                         v                              -Debitive                                 +Debitive                �-Potential               +Potential

restrictions on their co-occurrence , di stinguish a l l the prefixes in slot -8 ,
with the exception of person mark ing of Debitive forms .
At this stage , it will be most convenient to focus on further specif ications
to the left-most , non-Potential , non-Debitive branch of the diagram and return
to the Potential and the Debitive branches later .
                                                                                         63
Forms on this branch distingui sh Nonfactivity as marked in slot - 7 . A lthough
the Nonfactive prefix w- and the Factive prefix d- both make more than one
tense di stinction , it is preferable to identify Nonfactive as the marked form
for the purpose of this analy s i s .
S ince non-Debitive , non-Potential forms make precisely the same distinctions
regardless of their spec i f i cation for Negativity , further d i scussion w i l l be
neutral with respect to Negativity .
Nonfactive and non-Nonfactive forms distinguish tense through the feature
Nonpresent . Nonfactive forms spec i fied Nonpresent bear the Future suffix
and those specif ied non-Nonpresent bear the Desiderative suff ix . Non-Nonfactive
forms specif ied Nonpresent have past tense mark i ng , whi le those speci fied
non-Nonpresent are unmarked for tense .
This feature Conditional dist ingui shes forms with the Conditional suffix in
slot +4 from those that lack it. Condi tional forms are redundantly speci f ied
as Nonfactive . Thus non-Nonfactive forms wil l automatically be specif ied as
non-Conditional , while Nonfactive forms distingui sh Conditional and non­
Conditiona l .
Thi s analys i s conveniently specifies Conditional forms , which occur i n past
contrafactual condition s , as Nonfactive , Nonpresent , and Conditional , and
Frustratives , which depict frustrated de s i re s , as Nonfactive , non-Nonpresen t ,
and Conditional . Note that the only marker from s lot +5 that may co-occur with
the Conditional suf f ix i s the Desiderative suff ix .
I t is now appropriate to d i splay another diagram to c larify the feature
specif ications made thus far and the i r correspondence with verb suffixes .

4.7.5    Now we can turn our attention to forms specified as Potential .
Potential forms require Nonfactive marking and may bear either the Future
or the Conditional suffix. Redundancy rule 1 yields all possible forms under
this node.
    ( 4 8 ) Redundancy rule 1
            [+potential ] [+NonfactiveJ
                         -+
                              +Nonpresent
Note that Potential forms must also be non-Debitive and non-Negative , but
because all three categories, potential, Debitive, and Negative are expressed
by affixes in the same slot, the redundancy rule need not specify it.
Potential forms may still be specified for Conditionality. Potential
Conditionals take the Conditional suffix and Potential non-Conditionals take
the Future suffix, as was the case with non-Potential forms specified as
Nonfactive and Nonpresent.
4.7.6   Two additional redundancy rules will specify the mood and tense values
for Debitive forms. The first of these stipulates that Negative Debitives will
also be Nonfactive and Nonpresent, and so have Future marking, and
non-Negative Debitives will be neither.

    ( 49 ) Redundancy rule 2
               etNegat�ve      et Nonpresent
The second stipulates that any form specified as either Debitive or
non-Nonfactive will also be specified as non-Conditional.
             {[+Debitive   ] } [-Conditional ]
    ( 50 ) Redundancy rule 3
               [-non-Factive ]    -+
Figure 4 . 3 displays the feature specifications for Debitive and Potential forms.
(Note: numerals below each terminal node refer to forms in Tables 4 . 4- 7 ) .
4. 7. 7   A further redundancy rule specifies the permissible aspect distinctions           <[
for each tense/mood category isolated above.
                              ]
     ( 5 1 ) Redundancy rule 4                                  )
                    -Debitive
                    -Nonfactive      [-etImperfective]
                    -Nonpresent
                -et
             [etPerfect]
This rule stipulates that any form specified as Perfect will also be
non-Imperfective regardless of the specifications for the other three features
and that non-Perfect forms that
non-Nonpresent must be specified areas
                                       also non-Debitive, non-Nonfactive, and
                                       Imperfective. In other words , forms with
any Debitive or tense marking may bear     either Perfect or Imperfective marking,
or be unmarked for aspect, while non-Debitive     forms unmarked for tense must
bear either the Perfect or the Imperfective suffix.

1 0 . 1 . 2 The second strategy involves the seriali sation o f a truncated verb form
with a direction verb . There are two types of truncated verb serialisation .
In the first type the first verb consists of a fu ll set of pre fixe s and any
verb root , but no suff ixation whatsoever . The second verb consists of a full
verb complex whose root must be �y go . Speakers often re iterate the form of
�y a s many as five times or more , but only the last verb bears suffixation .
The semantic function of this strategy i s to depict prolonged continuous or
habitual a spect .

                    what haven ' t you two kep t going and doing to my turtle ?
Nothing may intervene within this type of seriali sation . The single ten se
marker , i f any , has scope over the entire serial i sation , as does any directional
pre fix or root compound , as i llustrated in ( ld ) . Example ( lb ) shows that if
the first verb has the Imperfective prefix , then the final verb must be an
Imperfective form. Simi larly , any Negative prefix must occur on both verbs , as
shown in ( ld ) .
One variation on thi s strategy involves the repetition of full forms of �y
after a truncated verb , with the same semantic function , as shown in examp le

The second type is formally very similar to the first . But there are three
major difference s . First , i n this strategy only two verbs may enter into the
seriali sation . Second , the first verb must be e ither � � ge t , l � Y bear , �� y
carry , one of the other verbs of carrying , or one o f the manner of motion
verbs , e . g . i my a run , towkaney climb ( c f . 5 . 4 . 2 ) . And third , the second verb
may be any of the Direction verbs .
When the first verb i s �� get , the second verb depicts a sequential action
deriving a form meaning ' take ' or ' br ing ' .

Whe re the first verb is a verb of carrying or a manner of motion verb , the
construction specifies direction and allows an accompanying source or goal NP .

Example ( 5 ) i l lustrates the distinction between a manner of motion verb alone
and such a verb in this construction , where there is a Locative NP in the
clause .
The inte rpretation of the Locative NP as source or goal depends upon the point
of view of the speaker and the class of the directional verb . Thus , the NP in
( 5b ) gets goal interpretation if the narrator adopts the perspective of being
outside the vil lage and source interpretation if the narrator adopts the point
of view of someone within the village ( c f . 5 . 3 . 1 ) .

Simi larly , the Locative NP in ( 6 ) will be a goal i f the speaker adopts inside
perspective , and a source if the narrator views the situation from outside .

verb form , with the same semantic function as the first type of truncated verb
seriali sation - to depict continuous or habitual aspect .

This construction ha s a characteristic intonation where each repetition of the
verb is pronounced with a low pitch , and the final syllable of the last
repetition is protracted and has a rising pitch .
                                                                                       155
10 . 1 . 4 The next strategy concatenates between two and five full verb forms .
Nothing may intervene between the verbs in this type of serialisation .
Although each verb is fully inflected , they d o not select categories
independently . Every verb must bear the same tense marking . Typical ly , each
verb will bear the same a spect marking as we l l . But since one or more of the
verbs may be serialisations of a truncated verb with �y , which is itse l f a mark
of a spect , there doe s not appear to be a constraint that a s ingle aspect must
have scope over the entire serialisation .
As nothing may interrupt the serialisation , the same argument or set o f
arguments w i l l apply t o every verb .

The intonation characteristic of this serialisation strategy involves a high
p itch on the penultimate syllable of each serialised verb falling over the
ultimate , with no pause between verb s , as shown in example [ 10 ] .               �

There is an intonation character istic o f thi s strategy that c learly
distinguishe s it from the preceding construction on the one hand , and from
other strategies with either a reiterated sub j e c t , a change of sub j e c t , or
a change of tense on the other .
156
In this case , the intonation rises over the penultimate syllable of each verb
in the serialisation , except the last , and remains high over the lengthened
ultimate syllable , fol lowed by a brie f paus e . When the subj ect changes or is
repeate d , the intonation falls from a high pitch ove r the penultimate syllable
to a low pitch over the las t . Example [ 1 1 ] i llustrates the intonation contour
over e xample ( 1 1 ) and example ( 1 3 ) shows the intonation contours over two
similar sentences .                   �;-                   �

1 0 . 1 . 6 The last strategy resembles a participial construction in certain
respects . Although there is no actual participial form in Awtuw , an
Imper fective form unmarked for tense functions like one in this construction .
The situations depicted by the two verbs are interpreted as simultaneous .
The tense of the second verb has scope over the unmarked first verb .
The ability of a subj ect to occur with the second , tense -marke d , verb
distinguishe s this construction from the one described in 10 . 1 . 5 .
The verbs accept independent aspect and directional marking , as shown in
e xample ( 14a) . Examples ( 14b) and ( 1 4c ) il lustrate that Adverbs and Location/
Direction NPs have scope over only one of the verbs .

The pre sence of terms from the last slot on the hierarchy would constitute a
serious violation if it did not have such terms . But there is one additional
violation - Berlin and Kay predict that a language with a seventh term will
have a term for ' brown ' and that languages with any of ' purple ' , ' pink ' ,
' orange ' , or ' grey ' will add those terms after ' brown ' . Awtuw ' s violation ,
whose import is in some que s tion because the terms involved are polymorphemic ,
is in having terms from the last category wi thout having a term for ' brown ' .
The terms �yp i ykwo red and nene l wo green are used by Awtuw spe ake rs in
referring to the brown segment of the colour chart . Figure 1 1 . 9 exhibits the
foci of Awtuw ' s e ight colour terms on a representation of Berlin and Kay ' s
colour chart . The strip at the left cons ist o f a range of greys without hue .
The colours on the body of the chart range from red on the left to purple on

Awtuw has four basic counting numerals . The se combine produc tive ly with y i y l e
hand, r i we foot , and rame man to form numerals a s high a s 4 19 . But in practice ,
Awtuw speakers se ldom use vernacular numerals in excess of 20 .
There are several reasons for this . First , for most purposes , Awtuw speake rs do
not concern themse lves with precision of numeration          l i wke a lot and y a n ke y ke
                                                                                         -
a litt le, few are ordinarily suf ficiently accurate .       Second , in counting cash ,
Awtuw speakers and the ir ne ighbours use a variety of denominations obviating
the need for large numerals ( see be low 1 1 . 3 . 3 ) . And fina l ly , all Awtuw
speakers are fluent in Tok Pisin and use Tok Pisin numerals freely in all
contexts .

These number-marked forms have some of the affixal properties of personal
pronouns . They take -e as the obj ect suffix , they accept possessive marking ,
and never take the locative suffix .
In add ition to these productive number markers , there i s a sma l l class of human
nouns that take irregular plurals ending in - m .","[43, 44, 45, 46]"

5.8   I d i oma t i c compo s i te c o n s t ru c t i o n s
A sma l l number o f Awtuw verb roots occur i n idiomatic composite constructions
with an obligatory , lexically specified noun which may not accept object
marking . Some roots only occur in such constructions , others occur in other
constructions in d i fferent meanings . As I mentioned ear l ier , this class o f
verbs intersects the categories o f transitivity . Most of the verbs in this
class depict intransitive bodily processes . Often the complementary noun
resembles an ' internal accusative ' in that its meaning does not contribute to
the meaning of the composite because the verb root alone conveys the whole
meaning and there i s no apparent derivational relationship between the noun and
the verb .

The complementary noun in these composite constructions is restricted in the
modification it may accept . Only an I ntensifier may co-occur with it .

4.6   Aspect mark i n g
The Awtuw verb di splays marking for two aspects - Perfect and Imperfective . The
Perfect is marked by a suf fix in s lot +2 , and the Imperfective by a c ircumf ix ,
the suffixal component of which appears in s lot +2 . The prefixal component
appears in s lot - 2 . Except when the verb is in a truncated verb seriali sation ,
both components of the Imperfective c ircumfix must co-occur ( see 1 0 . 1 . 2 ) .
60
The Imper fective marker appear s o n verbs depicting a situation that i s durative ,
continuous , progressive , or iterative in nature .

relevance , as in example ( 45b) , and Perfective , i . e . a situation viewed as
complete , as in example ( 4 5a) .

4.7        Fea t u re a n a l ys i s o f moda l i ty , ten s e , and a s pect catego r i e s
The preceding sections have mentioned a variety o f co-occurrence restrictions
among the affixes that may appear in the Awtuw verb complex . A simple statement
of positional restrict ions can account for some o f these . A verb may not be
spec ified , for example , as both Negative and Potential because once the
Negative prefix has occupied s lot -8 , the Potential prefix cannot do so , and
vice versa .
A number of co-occurrence restrictions apply to affixes that f i l l different
s lot s . The purpose of this section is to submit the relevant morphemes to an
analysis that assign s a set of feature speci fications to each and stipulates
the i r co-occurrence poss ibi lities in terms of a set of redundancy rules .
We w i l l be primarily concerned with the categories of tense , aspect , and mood ,
represented in verbal affixes in s lots - 8 , -7 , -2 , +2 , +4 , and +5 . There w i l l
also b e reason t o touch o n the category o f person , which i s represented i n
Awtuw onl y as a portmanteau o f the Debitive modal ity prefixes , and number .
S ince no co-occurrence restrictions apply to the other categories marked by verb
morphology , it w i l l be unnecessary to analyse them in thi s way .
Three features dist ingu i sh the categor ies of modal ity marked in s lot - 8 . The
feature Debitive distinguishes forms marked with p a - , kan - , wa n - , a p - , and n i 1 -
from those marked with n a - , k a - , or ¢ . Potential distinguishe s those marked
with n a - from tho se marked with k a - or ¢ . Negative distinguishes those marked
with ka- from unmarked forms on the one hand , and those marked with pa - , kan - ,
and wa n - from those marked with a p - and n i l - on the other .
The feature Nonfactive distinguishes forms marked with w- in s lot -7 from
those that do not bear the Nonfactive pre fix . As I mentioned in the discussion
above , Factive and Nonfactive marking is conditioned by tense . This makes the
non-Factive feature useful in the spec i f ication of the tense suffixes as wel l
as the Factive and Nonfactive prefixes . Specifical ly , the feature
distinguishes Future and Desiderative forms from Past and unmarked forms .
The purpose of this analysis is to describe co-occurrence restrictions on overt
morphemes . The features therefore corre spond directly with morphological
categor ies . Ideal ly , a feature mediates between a morphologically marked
category and a corresponding semantic category . S ince the morphological
category of Nonfactivi ty i n Awtuw i s semantically redundant , specifications
of forms for thi s feature may at times seem arbitrary .
The feature Nonpresent distinguishes Past and Future forms , which are overtly
marked and have Nonpresent time reference from Desiderative forms and forms
unmarked for tense , which have present time reference .
Fina l l y , the features Conditional , Perfect , Imperfective , Second Person , Third
Person , P lural , and Dual are morphologically and semantically transparent .
Since the categories o f aspect , person , and number i n Awtuw a l l make three-way
d i st inction s , a pair of features is required for each .","[65, 66, 67]"

1 1 . 1 . 7 There is a name taboo associated with various af final re lations . The
form this taboo takes is that ego may not pronounce the personal name s of anyone
standing in the appropriate relation to him or her - Awtuw speake rs typically
have from three to six personal name s - eithe r in reference or in addre ss .
All name taboos are reciprocal , whether the terms by which Ego and the specified
affine addre ss each other are reciprocal or not . Thus , Ego and his sister ' s
husband ' s s ister cal l each other a y ra m and may not pronounce each othe r ' s name s .
But although Ego calls h i s wife ' s mother Qamey and she calls him yen a n , they
still may not pronounce each othe r ' s name s . Affines in a name-taboo relationship
addre ss and re fer to each other by the name of the re lation .
Moreover , Ego may not address or refer to any namesake of the relevant affines
by the tabooed name . Generally , anyone who is not in a name-taboo re lation with
Ego wi l l have at least one personal name that does not overlap with the persona l
names of those who are in such a re lation to Ego . Note that the namesake o f
someone i n a name taboo relation with Ego may pronounce Ego ' s name , provided Ego
is not a name sake of someone in a name -taboo relation with that person .
Finally , where an aff ine in a name-taboo re lation to Ego has a personal name
that i s also a common noun or one that resemble s a common noun close ly , Ego may
not use that common noun . Affines in a name-taboo relation to Ego are
represented by filled triangles and circles in Figures 1 1 . 1-7 .
We c an i l lustrate this with reference to the data in Figure 1 1 . 7 .","[188, 189, 190]"

stands in the relation marne to Ego , is named Rose . Ego ' s marne is not in a name­
taboo re lation . Ego ' s wife ' s mother , who is in a name-taboo relation , is also
named Rose . There fore , when Ego marries Tanya , he may no longer addre ss or
re fer to his mother ' s brother ' s wife by the name Rose . Furthermore , he may no
longer use the common noun ros e , but must use a paraphrase . Fortunate l y , most
Awtuw speakers and members of the groups with whom they intermarry have , as I
mentioned above , several name s . And pe rsonal name s that resemble common nouns
are comparatively rare . Note that Ego ' s mothe r ' s brother ' s wife , Rose , may
still pronounce Ego ' s name , provided Ego is not the namesake of someone in a
name-taboo re lation to he r .
The a ffines whose name s Ego may not pronounce inc lude wa l ne opposite sex

                                                                            '

In addition , the name taboo applies to specific individuals who Ego ca l l s l am
younger s� sex sib ling , yaye o lder same sex sib ling , �aye father , and �amey
mother. Speci fically , a male Ego may not pronounce the name of his wife ' s
mother , �amey , his wife ' s fathe r , �aye , his younger brothe r ' s wife , l am , or his
wife ' s older siste r , yaye . A female Ego may not pronounce the names of he r
husband ' s parents , �amey and �aye , her younger sister ' s husband , l am , or her
husband ' s older brothe r , yaye .
It is worth stressing that the taboo on pronouncing the names of specific
affines does not enta il any othe r speech taboos . Ego may speak to or about
those in a name taboo relation to him or her freely . Indeed , the viri local
residence pattern typical in the Awtuw- speaking area ensure s that any male Ego
is normally in frequent , if not constan t , contact with his younger brother ' s
wife . And any female Ego is in contact with her husband ' s parents and older
brothe rs .","[190, 191]"

have unreleased al lophones word final ly . Voiced a llophones occur fol lowing a
nasal preceded by a stressed vowe l . They are di stinguished by the following
minimal pairs :
        / p a p / just then         / t a p/ thatch
        / t i w/ foliage            /kiw/ pitpit
        /pa re / wi l l pee l       / k a re / wi l l get
The nasal stops are /m , n , Q/ . The alveolar nasal optionally assimilates to a
following / p / or / k / ( see 2 . 2 . 2 and 2 . 2 . 6 ) . The velar nasal is only phonemic
word initial ly , where it occurs in a small number of very high frequency
lexemes . The velar nasal is only phonemiC in the maj or ity dialect descr ibed in
this grammar , the Southern dialect replaces it with a glottal stop and the
Witit dialect with /n / . Chi ldren ' s speech also cons iste ntly SUbstitutes / n /
for /Q / . The nasals are di stinguished b y the following minimal pairs :
        /ma ke / went and got           / Qake/ beneath
        / na1e/ hole                -   / Qa1e/ fish
        /wa n / I                   -   /wam/ b lunt
The fol lowing minimal pairs distinguish the nasal stops from the corresponding
oral stops :
        /prey/   let me go             /rrey /  sun
        / t i w/ fo liage              /niw/    ground

The alveolar tap I rl i s in free variation with a tri ll at the same point of
articu lation . The other tap Idl is slightly retroflexed . The alveolar tap
occurs only in the ma jority dialect and the Witit dialec t . The Southern
dialect substitutes I l l , as is also the case in children's speech . They are
distinguished by the following minimal pair :
         I romkel their       -    I domkel fu l l
The fol lowing minimal pairs distinguish the taps from the alveolar oral stop
I t /:
       Id�yel went    It�yel went ( Dual)
       I rawl ca l l  I t awl tree
The lateral II I is always a liquid lateral and does not surface as a tap .                           The
following minimal pairs distinguish III from the two taps and the other
alveolar consonants :
         I l �e/ baked                     I r�el them two
         I l �ye l came upstream           Id�y el went

         I l �ye l came upstream           I t�yel went ( Dual )
The semivowels Iw , yl occur both as consonantal glides between vowe ls and after
Ip l and Ik/ , and as offglides of diphthongs , as mentioned in 2 . 1 . 1 . The
fol lowing minimal pair motivates their distinction :
         Iwaml b lunt     -   Iyaml bee

To begin with the pronouns , we notice immediately that there are two
demonstrative roots , ( t ) a de and ( t ) opo , each of which codes a category of
proximity , within reach and out of reach respectively . The se are then marked
for plurality with the suffix -m . Non-plural forms further distingui sh female
from non-female referents . The optional t- in the pronouns and the manner
adverb does not appear to correlate with any grammatical category and forms
with and without the t- are in free variation . The eight manner adverb forms
also seem to be in free variation .
We may conveniently compress the demonstrative adverb forms into the fol lowing
constructs .

3 . 6 . 4 Like the demonstratives , Awtuw interrogative pronouns and adverbs display
formal s imi larities that suggest that they ought to be treated together . There
are three basic interrogative adverbs and two pronouns , but the use of the
derivational suffix - kwo allows Awtuw to express a full range of WH- questions

5.4. 1     C a rd i n a l t ran s i t i ve verbs
The cardinal transitive verbs fall into four subclasse s . First , we can identify
those verbs that can co-occur with arguments bearing Locative case marking
( c f . 6 . 5 ) . Most of the cardinal transitive verbs may co-occur with such NPs ,
but only three take such NPs as arguments . These NPs are identi f i able as
arguments because they must be interpreted as either a source or a goal .
Locative NPs occurring with other cardinal transitive verbs are interpreted as
location s .
         ( 21)   (a)    r e y yekne - re � r e- ke d i - kay- kay
                        3MS axe- 0 house-L FA-put-PF
                        he has put the axe into the house
                 (b)    rey yekne- re rew re- ke d- i knrer-kay
                        3MS axe- 0 house-L FA-break-PF
                        he has broken the axe in the house
                       *he has broken the axe (in) to the house
The three roots in the Direct ional c lass are , �� y ( 1 ) put , �� y ( 2 ) remove , and
l re t pour.
Next , we can i solate the single verb that can co-occur with an argument in the
I nstrumental case ( c f . 6 . 3 ) which is interpreted as a source .
         (22)    (a)    wan topo r tawkway N i mp i y- t ek d a - k ' - a
                        l SG that tobacco NimpiY- I         FA-get-p
                        I got that tobacco from Nimpiy
                 (b)    wan topo r t awkway N i mp i y- t ek r ' -   e
                        lSG that tobacco Nimpiy- I           consume-p
                        I smoked that tobacco with Nimpiy
                       *I smoked that tobacco from Nimpiy
                 (c)    wan rey yaw- re a l me- rek d - i y- i
                        lSG 3MS pig-o arroW- I      FA-shoot-p
                        I shot the pig with an arrow
                       *I shot the pig from an arrow
The root �� , is , as I said , the unique member o f the Source class .
Then we can segregate those verbs that can take a predication as the ir
complement ( c f . 1 0 . 2 ) . As example ( 2 3b) il lustrates , while other cardinal
transitive verbs may co-occur with similar constructions , they must be
interpreted as purpose or result clau ses ( c f . 1 0 . 2 . 3 and 10 . 2 . 6 ) .
         (23)    (a)    wan Yawu r w- rey- re- re nenren da-k- l ay - ey
                        lSG Yawur NF-go-FU-O thought FA-I P-bear- IP
                        I think that Yawur wi l l go
                 (b)    wan Yawu r w- rey - re- re k i l d - a l ow- 0
                        lSG Yawur NF-go-FU-O speech FA-speak-p
                        I spoke so that Yawur would go
                       *I spoke that Yawur would go

The balance of the cardinal transitive verbs are all actions with the exception
of the one remaining static verb ��Q love . They do not fall into further
subclasses on formal criteria . I l i s t most of them in Table 5 . 7 .","[102, 103, 104]"

7 . 3 . 1 As I mentioned above , there is a constraint pertaining to Kinship terms
- i f a Kinship term occurs as the Determine r , then there must be an unmodi fied
Persona l Name in the Nominal slo t . The members of the c lass of Kinship te rms
are iso lated formally in 3 . 3 and l isted exhaustive l y , with some discussion , in
11 . 1 . Example ( 1 1 ) i l lustrates thi s constraint and [ 1 1 ] displays the structure

Applying thi s ru le before e li s ion results in the correct form :

This rule must follow the preceding rule because the Iyl that it deletes is a
nece ssary part of that rule ' s environment .
This rule deletes the f inal Iyl of the Perfect suf fix - k a y , or of the
Imperfective suffix -ey before the plural suffix - m . The rule applies
obligatorily when the - m immed iately precedes the word boundary , and
optionally when conditional or tense marking fol lows i t .

Thi s rule determines the qual i ty of word-fina l vowe l s in the Past and Future
suff ixes as we l l as the Obj ec t suf f i x on nouns and pronouns .
The f i r s t part of the rule changes the canonical /e/ of these suffixes to [ o j
after /m/ or /w/ when the preced ing vowel is a back vowel . Thus , the ob j ec t
forms of a l l plural personal pronouns , nom , om , and rom , end i n /0/ .
S imilarly , plural forms of nouns , with the suffix -wom , condi t ion the -0
allomorph of t h e obj ec t suf f i x . The f i n a l /w/ of t h e third person d u a l pronoun
rrew , and the final /m/ of the generic form of nouns , with the suffix -yren i m ,
do not condit ion the - 0 a l lomorph because the preced ing vowel s are not back .

                              -
is back , the f inal / n / o f the root does not meet the rule ' s cond i tions .

Note that thi s rule must fo l low the e l i s ion rule , as i t applies t o the output
of that rule .
        /d -wanwa -e/ + [ d -wanw- e ] + [ d -wa nwo ]                    washed
The second part of the rule is virtually identical to the vowel harmony rule
applying to the Imperfective suffix . The main dif ference i s that where root­
f inal vowel s conditioned that rul e , they must be e l ided before the app l ication
of this rul e . If this rule appl ied before e l i sion in a root l ike i l � � boi l , it
would derive a spurious form :
        / d - i 1 ya-e/ + [ d - i 1 ya-e ] ( by thi s rule)                +   ,� [ d i 1 ye ] ( by e l is ion)
Applying e l i s ion f irst derives the correct form :
        /d - i l ya - e / + [ d - i l y - e ] ( by e l i s ion )      +   [ d i l y i ] ( by thi s rule)
This part of the rule changes the canonical /e/ of the Past , Future , and Obj ect
suf f ixes to / i / under the same conditions as described above .

"5 . 1 . 3 In summary , then , I define the three identifiable grammatical relations
as follows :
( 1 ) The subj ect is that NP that never takes obj ect marking , even when
pronominal , that triggers person and number agreement on the verb , that is the
obligatory antecedent of an emphatic pronoun , and that may occur as the direct
obj ec t of the matrix clause in di rect perception constructions .
( 2 ) The direct object i s the NP that takes optional object marking when i t i s
a common noun and when i t s referent is lower in empathy than , o r less l ikely to
have performed the action than , the subj ect .
                                                                                          91
( 3 ) The indirect object i s that N P that takes obl i gatory obj ect marking under
all circumstances .","[96, 97]"
"
5 . 5 . 1 One verb , � Q� give , does not derive an ordinary transitive verb . I f
e i ther the direct o r the indirect object is missing from a c lause , i t i s either
recoverable from context or irrelevant .

5 . 5 . 2 Three bitransitive verbs derive transitive verbs whose direct obj ect
corresponds to the direct object of the bitrans itive verb . These are � � � say ,
te l l , i � � � � ask , and l r ��i apportion.

                   Rw.umay told me something
Two of these verbs , �� � say , te l l and y � �� � ask may take complement c lause s , as
in example ( 2 5 ) ( c f . 1 0 . 2 . 2 and 10 . 2 . 5 ) . The second of the se may also occur
with an ordinary direct obj ect NP in the sense ask about , if the object is
human , or ask for , if not . Example ( 26 ) i l lustrates that when there are two
human NPs , the clause is systematically ambiguous as to which NP i s the direct ,
and which is· the indirect obj ect . But when a single human NP occurs as the
obj ect , it is obligatorily interpreted as the direct obj ect unless another
direct obj ect is recoverable from context , as exempli fied in ( 26b) .
      (26)   (a)   Ruwmay Yawu r - re wa n - e d i - y� r n r - e

                   Rw.umay asked about Yawur

The third verb in this class takes only non-sentential NPs as direct obj e cts .

5 . 5 . 3 The ob j ect deletion verbs are i � � i Y name , i � � feed, and i Y �� !� Y teach.
The last of these takes an imperfective nominal construction as its complement
( c f . 10 . 2 . 3 ) .

The fir st , i �� i Y name , takes a persona l name as direct obj ect . This verb ha s
the unusual property that the direct obj ect may not bear object case marking .

Finally, i � � feed, typically takes a direct obj ect that is edible , although
mythical characters sometimes give each other inedible substances to eat .

 5.6         C l a s s i fi ca t i on of verbs
We can now represent the structure o f the classi fication of all verbs as a tre e .","[106, 107, 108]"
"
4 . 9 . 3 Where there is both a subj ect and a comitative , the following pr inciples
determine the number agreement on the verb and the interpretation of the number
of actors .
(1)    Number marking on the verb i s optional i n any comitative construction .
( 2 ) Where the verb i s marked for number , i t may agree either with the actual
number of actors , inctuding both the subj ect and the comitative , or with the NP
whose referent is the more numerous .
( 3 ) I f the subj ect i s not first person dua l , then the sub j ect does not inc lude
the comitative and the number of actors must be interpreted as the total of the
sub j ect plus the number of the comitative .
( 4 ) I f the sub j ect is f irst person dual and the comitative is s ingular , then
number agreement on the verb may disambiguate the number of actors .
       ( a ) I f the verb bears dual marking , then the dual subj ect includes the
       singular comitative .
       (b)  I f the verb is marked with a plural suf fix , then the dual sub j ect
       does not include the s ingular comitative and there i s a total of three
       actors .
       ( c ) I f the verb is unmarked for number , then the sentence w i l l remain
       ambiguous as to whether there are two or three actor s .
( 5 ) I f either the subj ect or the comitative i s plural , then the verb w i l l
e i ther have plural marking o r b e unmarked .

                    they wi l l go with Yowmen and someone
These principles account for the fol lowing facts concerning the interaction of
number marking and a comitative construction .
I f both the subj ect and the comitative are dual , then there are four actors and
the verb may be marked as e i ther dual , plura l , or unmarked .

prefixes t aw- yet , sti l l and owra- again in separate s lot s , -5 and - 4 . Both of
these prefixes are very productive . Frequently owra - occurs attached to the
root � y � come to derive a form meaning return.

The other prefix , taw- , often occurs in Temporal c l auses ( c f . 1 0 . 3 ) . Like
several of the ' compound ' suffixe s , this prefix , along with regular tense and
aspect marking , and the nominal suff ix -wo just which can occur on verb forms
in certain syntactic environments , helps Awtuw to compensate for its lack of
con j unction s . Among them , these strategies can produce a wide range of
temporal c lause types ( cf . 10 . 3 ) .

Awtuw codes gramma tical ly , through verb affixation , a number of concepts that
in other languages might require an additional verb . In particul ar , the suffix
-kayna and go is used to indicate that the subj ect goes away after performing
the action depicted by the verb roo t .
Most of the pref ixe s in the Location/Direct ion s lot - 6 can have much the same
function . Ma- go and spec i fical ly , has virtua lly the opposite affect from
- kayna    the sub j ect move s and then performs the action depicted by the root .
             -
Ma - doe s not specify the d irection of motion , whether it is from a source or
to a goal , or whether it is up or down with relation to s lope or stream .

The four Location/Direction prefixes can have much the same effect as ma- , but
do grammatic i se the d i rection as e ither up or down with re lation to s lope or
stream.

Slot +1 i s unlike any other s lot in three maj or respects . First , there are at
least 3 0 morphemes , li sted below , that can fill it . Second , as many as three
of the e l i gible morphemes can co-occur in the same verb complex . I have chosen
to place the entire class o f morphemes in the same s lot , rather than three
separate slot s , because any of the e ligible morphemes would be able to occupy
any of the s lot s , as long as no s ingle morpheme occurs more than once . And
final l y , seven of the morphemes are identical or nearly identical in form to a
verb root that occurs independently. I t is for thi s reason that I have
designated the slot a Compound slot. Another factor that has contributed to
this deci sion is the semantic diversity that the morpheme s in this class
d i splay. They range from the Benefactive suffix -kow which increases the
valence of the verb it i s attached to , through the aspectual-l ike I nchoative
suffix - tffiwa , to such apparently lexical and adverbial meanings as - a t a in
order to detain someone .
Every member of this class of morphemes is of a phonological shape plausible
for a verb root , i . e . they end in a consonant or /a/ , and it i s l ike ly that
this construction has ari sen diachronically from a very tightly-bound verb
serialisation . As the seriali sation crystall ised into suffixation , some o f the
verbs which could participate in the seriali sation have ceased to occur as
independent verb s , and a few have not yet done so .
The suffixes that can f i l l this slot may conveniently be divided into semantic
c lasses wh ich I label Grammatical , ' pretend ' Aux i l iary , Aspectual , Quantitative ,
Adverbia l , Consecutive , and Obstructive .
76
I n Table 4 . 7 , I l i st the morphemes that can occur in this position , and have
come to my attention . Each entry includes a gloss for the suffix , and , where
relevant , for the morpheme when it oc curs independently. I have f lagged the
most common morphemes with an asteri sk .","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82]"

2.1.4     Phonota ct i c c o n s t ra i n t s
Each of the seven vowels can occur word initially and may take stress .
Word-final vowels are never stressed . The low vowels are reduced to schwa
word finally . The high back vowe l does not occur word final ly .
        /, i m/       night                /dCll l i /   bit
        / ' e t i y/ pain                  /pa re/       will pee l
        / ' CIlm/     lime
        / ' a l ap/ yesterday              / raka/       has eaten
        / ' a n/      you two
        / ' om/       you a l l            / d a l owo/ spoke
        / ' u p u r / throat
The following examples each i l lustrate that the front and back vowel s occur
word medially both with and without stress .
        / ' k i n i k/    sit!
        /ken ' e twa/ extinguish!
        /CIlp ' CIl l re/ don ' t bite !
        / ' ka na k l a/ dig!
        / ' konor/        copulate !
        /kun ' puya/ hi t !
The central vowel also occur s stressed and unstressed i n word-medial position :
        / ' kanwan/ lis ten            / ' a l ap / yesterday
Sequences of vowel s do not occur in Awtuw . The elision rule described in 2 . 2 . 9
deletes one of any two vowels that come together across a morpheme boundary .
Any consonant can occur word initially , and any consonant except /8/ can occur
word f inally , as illustrated by the fol lowing examples :
        / pam/     joint                          / t a p/   thatch
        / t am/    cross cousin                   /pat/      flat
        /ka re/    get !                          /pak/      palm, sole
        /make/     went and got                   / pa m/    joint
        / na l e/  hole                           /nan/      w e two
        / 8a 1 e/  fish
        / rom/     they                           /kanpa r/ pee l !
        /da l owo/ spoke                          /kud/         bamboo species
        / l a pe/  vi l lage                      /k i nCll l / bite !
        /wa n/     I                              / n aw/       urine
        /YCllm /   banana                         /mCIly/       sun
Consonant clusters occur word initially , word medially , and word final l y .
Geminates d o not occur a t all . A n epenthetic vowel breaks u p sequences of
/k/s ( 2 . 2 . 1 ) and a geminate reduction rule ( 2 . 2 . 17 ) deletes the first of any
other two adj acent identical consonants .
word-initial consonant clusters are extremely rare and occur almost exc lus ively
in biological terms . Most clusters have the form s top + / r / , although there is
one example of /ky/ and one of /mw/ .
        /p rawan/        sma l l wasp
        / p ramnanke l / kind of she l l ring
        / t rank/        barb
        / t ramt rom/    kind of sma ll frog
        / k ro r/        kind of bird
                                                                                               15
         Ik rek rekl       kind of frog
         Ikyrewkyrewl      kind of banana
         IITMeymoyl        worm
Sequences of two or three consonants are also unusual word finally . There is
only one example of a word ending in three consonants           -    I t i wnkl fern. A few
other words end in Ink/ , although there are no examples of word- f inal Impl or
I n t i c lusters . The cluster I r pl occurs in I k i n i r pl c lose ( the door) ! and two
other forms of IrQ c lose .
Aside from these , there are a few examples o f words ending i n a semivowel and
a stop or a nasal such as I t uwpl s traightaway , Ikuwml boi l (on the skin) , and
luykl odour.
word-medial c lusters of two or three consonants a r e very common . Sequences of
three stops are pos sible in this position , as in the following examples :
         la p t ' ka rel           don 't you two ge t it
         Id i knCBkp ' tCBt i yl   is frightening
It is interesting to note that the stop sequence in the first example crosses
two morpheme boundaries , but the second example includes the unique root
���e!�!, which has a three stop c luster within the root .
Other clusters that occur word medially inc lude sequences o f two semivowels ,
and of semivowels and taps or laterals :
         Iw i ywa rel       wi U bathe
         I roko ryakal      broken
         Ima l wa rel       wi U descend

         IWCBy row rel      wi U float
         Idotko l yel       ki Ued
2. 1.5      Stre s s p l a ceme n t
B y and large , main word stre s s , which entai ls a r i s e i n pitch and a s light
increase in loudness , tends to fall on the first syllable of an Awtuw word .
There is also a tendency towards penultimate stress . Where the two tendencies
coincide , on disyl labic words , the stress pattern is regular .
         I ' k i n i kl   sit
         1' 1 a pel       vi Uage
         I ' t a pwol     fire
         I ' eywol        thus
Where the two tendenc ies do not co incide , but the first and penul timate
syl lable s are not adj acen t , in polysyl labic words , primary stress wi l l usually
fall on the penult and secondary stress on the first syllable .
         I ' 0 rkewey""naywol        four
         I ' a te""payel             far out!
         I ' owt i y""ka Y CBnl      old
         I ' pe r i ya""yawnowl      grass
There are , however , a number of exceptions to this generali sation among words
other than verbs , while ve rbs do not appear to follow it at all .
16
      Iye ' na n keykel        grandchild
      Imo ' nokenel            bad
      Ikay ' pu te r i yl      dus t
On trisyllabic words other than verbs , where the two tendencies would place
stress on ad j acent syl lables , some words fol low one tendency and others the
other .
      I'wa rukel             big
      I ' yan keykel         sma l l
      I ' a l wo rawl        mouth
      I ' t i pe l yowl      smoke
      Iw i Y ' t a pel       river
      I y i l ' makel        moon
      Iwom ' yce t nel       some
      I tey ' wakel          near
The addition of a case marker or derivational suf f ix does not affect the
position of stress on a word other than a verb .
      Iw i y ' t a pel           river
      Iw i y'ta pe-kel           at the river
      I ' ta pwol                fire
      I't a pwo- rel             fire-O
      I ' ta pwo- neneyl         hot
On the whole , verb forms that are not disyllabic do not follow the same
patterns as other words . One generali sation we can make i s that the Future and
Des iderative forms of la / - f inal roots have primary stress on the root- f inal /a / .
      I ' ka rel                   wi l l get
      I ' ra rel                   wi l l eat
      Iwow ' n a rel               wi l l s leep
      I rok ' ra rel               wi l l cook
      I t i ' tamku r""y a rel      wi l l miss
      I ' l am l aak""na rel        wi l l fal l
Affixation o f a verb doe s affect the placement of stre s s .
      I p u ' ya rel       wi l l hit
      I ' d u p uyel       hit
Aside from this , verb roots appear to condition stress patterns idiosyncratic­
ally , independent of their phonological form .
      I ' d i k i r i yl    is sharpening
      Id i ' k i l i y l    is twisting
It is beyond the scope of thi s chapter to explore in detail the complexities
o f stress placement on verb forms .","[19, 20, 21, 22]"

                                                 PARALANGUAGE1 2 . 1 · Greet i ng s a n d fa rewe l l s
Traditional ly , Awtuw has no formulaic greetings . The arrival of a person is
acknowledged by cal ling his or he r name , kinship term , or quasi-kinship term .
One does not of course address by name those aff ine s who are in a name taboo
re lationship with Ego ( c f . 1 1 . 1 . 7 ) . Nowadays Awtuw speakers wi l l typica l ly use
greetings borrowed from Tok Pisin and often even substitute Tok Pisin for
vernacular kin terms .
      ( 1)   g u t mon i n g n a u , O s i y/waway
             good morning now Osiy/mother 's brother
             good morning, Osiy/mother 's brother!
      (2)    a p i n un t r u , p o roma n /ye n a n keyke
             afternoon rea Z agemate/grandchi Zd
             good afternoon, agemate/grandchi Zd!
      (3)    gu tna i t n a u , y i y t a y/wa nnem
             goodnight now namesake
             goodnight, namesake !
The vernacular formula for parting is reyp apwo finished accompanied by the
addre ssee ' s name and optionally by an impe rative appropriate to what the
addre ssee i S , about to do . Tok Pisin greetings are in common use in this
context, but because there is a sati s fying vernacular alternative , they have
not become as ubiquitous as they have as greeting s . Gene rally when a group o f
people leaves , o r remains , one says reypa pwo t o each of them individual ly .
      (4)    Reypa pwo ! Powk i 1 , reypapwo . Ka n - ey !
             goodbye     Powki Z goodbye       IMP-go
             Goodbye , Powki Z, go !
      (5)    (a)    Reypapwo ! Ka-m- own a - m !
                    goodbye    IM GO S Zeep-PL
                                      -      -
                    Goodnight ! (addressee Zeaving)
             (b)    Owo . Reypa pwo , Peyaw ! Kan-w- owna !

                    Goodnight, Peyaw ! (addressee remaining)
Note that ( 5a) and ( 5b) are the usual formu las for saying ' goodnight ' and are
reciprocal .  ( See 4 . 10 for the ma- and wa - prefixes . The response to a
greeting or a farewell always begins with owo yes , also i l lustrated in example

Locative NPs are a lmost exclusively adverbial in nature . Awtuw speakers will
occasional ly accept a Locative NP as a nominal modi fier , but with noticeable
re luctance . Such constructions are therefore clearly not fe licitous , and
a lmost certainly not grammatica l .

A restrictive re lative clause , as in ( 3 7 a ) , or a non-restrictive re lative
clause , as in ( 3 7b ) , are the only structures available to expre ss such notions .

6.6   Voca t i ve
The Vocative suffix (V) occurs only when the speaker wishes to attract the
attention of the addre ssee ( c f . 12 . 3 ) . It does not mark nouns in the course
of conversation . The only nouns that accept thi s suffix are personal names
and kinship terms that bear no number marking .

rigid is within the Noun Phras e . This chapter describes the constituents of
