"6 Nouns
   Nouns are of the following types: simple nouns, compounds, alienable and inalienable
nouns. Nouns referring to human beings are marked for gender. Nouns have possessive
inflection by means of bound pronouns prefixed to inalienable nouns and by means of the
subject prefixed verb tar or bi 'to possess' preceding the alienable noun. Nouns as head of
noun phrases can be modified by adjectives, numerals and demonstratives following the
noun. Loans are predominantly from neighbouring languages: Numforese, Irianese Malay or
Standard Indonesian, but also from Dutch. Since loans do not behave differently from
original Mpur words, they will not be further discussed.
                                                                A sketch oj Mpur 6 16.1 Simple nouns
  Examples of simple nouns are:
  (57 )    fa        banana
           iw        bird
           war       river
           yet       fire
           kwap      rope.bag
           wom       hand
           prei      green onions (from Dutch prei)6.2 Compounds
   I n compound nouns easy elisions o f syllable final consonants or sometimes of whole
syllables occur. Examples of compounds are:  (58)     am-fe(k)-bur
           eye-skin-body.hair
           eyebrow
  (59 )    ambon-kwe
           neck-swelling
           goitre
  (60)     marwabur
           mamir-dwaw-bur
           person-pig-body.hair
           good hunter
  (6 1 )   kaparek
           kapal-dek
           ship-fly
           aeroplane
6.3 Nominaliser bar
  A special case of compounding involves bar 'thing ' , which is frequently used in
combination with other nouns or as nominaliser with members of other word classes. For
example:
  (62)     bain
           bar-in
           thing-grow
           garden
  (63)     baret
           bar-det
           thing-eat
           food
62      Cecilia Ode     (64)     baprokir
              bar-prek-dokir
              thing-leg-two
              cassowary
     (65)     bawantek
              bar-wantek
              thing-sick
              illness
     (66)     mabakwar
              ma-bar-kwar
              REL-thing-sharp
              criminal6.4 Alienable nouns   There are two possessive pronouns which are used with alienable nouns. Both -tar and -bi
always precede the noun. The possessive morpheme bi is identical to the Abun form (see
Berry & Berry 1 999:78). Examples of alienable nouns in a context with possessive pronouns
are presented below:
     (67)     In-un    si n-tar      jan.
              I SG-go to I SG-POS     house
              I go to my house.
     (68)     De-ter       a-bi     jetenon.
              3PL-put 3SM-POS knife
              They put down his knife.
     (69)     E-rak-bar           Lambert-a    a-bi    barrY-in.
              IPL-work-thing Lambert-3SM       3SM-POS thing-grow
              We work in Lambert's garden.","[16, 17, 18]"
"   The prepositions bari 'from', ku 'to, at, in' and mim 'till' are used for both spatial and
temporal relations. Examples of both uses are as follows:
   ( 1 34)    In-un      bari        Bwatem       si Anja .
              I SG-go from Saukorem to Anjai.
              I walk from Saukorem to Anjai.
   ( 1 35)    A -un      bari        krimbor.
              3sM-go since morning
              He walks since the morning.
   (1 36)     Bari     nan      ten.
              from 2SG just

              At night we hear lizards.
   ( 1 38)    Do-rokwa         bik       mim jan.
              3DU-take bamboo till     house
              They took the bamboo as far as the house.
   Non-spatial prepositions are, for instance, tut 'with (comitative)"" ka 'with (instrument)""
na 'to (recipient)' as shown in the following examples:
   ( 1 39)    A-un       tut     per.
              3SM-go with dog
              He goes with his dogs (he goes hunting).
   ( 1 40)    A       in-mam ka         in-wom.
              ah I SG-cut that I SG-hand
              Well, I will cut down (the garden) with my hand.
72      Cecilia Ode     (141)     Do-ton     nton dur         ka    yaw nan .
               3DU-cut child navel with HES k.o.bamboo
               They cut the child's navel with, eh, poisonous bamboo.
     ( 1 42)   A n-det   ka       asyok.

               l SG-say to       2SG
               I say to you.
   Prepositions bari 'from ' and mim 'till' occur also as verbs 'come.from ' and 'arrive',
respectively:     ( 1 44)   Amanda-n        m-bari             bain .
               Amanda-3SF 3SF-come.from garden
               Amanda comes back from the garden.
     ( 1 45)   N-aw      m-mim         m-binon         der      pa.
               3SF-run 3SF-arrive 3SF-brother 3PL already
               She ran till she had arrived at her brothers'.
     The preposition 'between' can be expressed as follows:
     ( 1 46)   Wor o-jap         be mamir fiti         a -jap     ku ka-wow.
               I OU I OU-sit but person other 3SM-sit at                that-body
               Somebody sits between us.
     ( 1 47)   ni     war-(d)okir fraru         braw         nz       war-(d)okir
               tree CLF-two      middle between              tree CLF-two
               between two trees
     Note that b(e)raw also means 'with', 'and':
     ( 1 48)   Fawar     a-kon         beraw    der-o.
               finally 3sM-sleep with       3PL-CL
               Finally he sleeps with them.
     ( 1 49)   nton braw per
                child and     dog
                the child and the dog10 Spatial orientation
    In addition to the rather general locative prepositions, discussed in ยง9, Mpur employs a
number of spatial relator nouns to specify the spatial orientation of an object. Some of these
are clearly nouns in their own right, such as bwan 'hole', others transparently refer to body
parts, such as dir 'rib', again others can be classified as nouns, because they occur as object
of the preposition be. This preposition has not been discussed in ยง7, since it is rather
restricted to locative phrases with or without spatial nouns. Some spatial nouns are included
in this category on the basis of analogy to the items mentioned. That is, if a noun referring to
an object which serves as spatial anchoring point is present, the spatial nouns either follow
                                                                         A sketch ofMpur 73that noun directly, as in (1 50), or with an additional instance of the preposition be, as in
( 1 5 1 ).
    ( 1 50)    N-un    be    dok     upem.
               3SF-go LOC bridge under
               She walks under the bridge.
    (151)      Wor be      sor        be-am.
               sea LOC mountain LOC-side
               The sea is behind the mountains.
   Items which follow a head noun of a locative phrase immediately, in other words, those
which enter constructions, as in ( 1 50), are bwan 'hole' andfraru 'middle', as in the following
examples:
    ( 1 52)    A-jap     ku jan      bwan.
               3SM-sit in house hole
               He sits inside the house.
    ( 1 53)    N-kem ku war fraru.
               3SF-fall in river middle
               She falls in the middle of the river.
   In the case of body part terms dir 'rib' and dumom 'front', the spatial anchoring point can
be a human, in which case the appropriate person prefix is attached, as in:
    ( 1 54)    Tep kon be         an-dir.
               plate lie    LOC 2SG-side
               The plate lies beside you.
    ( 1 55)    In-i         domi Mince-n n-dumom .
                I SG-stand before M ince-3SF 3SF-front.of.body
                I stand before Mince.
Note that in example ( 1 55) n-dumom '3SF-front.of.body' may be omitted.
   When no anchoring noun is available, the locative phrase consists of just the preposition be
plus the spatial noun, consider:
     ( 1 56)   An-rer bar-(dJet be-u.
               2SG-put eat-thing Loc-inside
               Put the food inside.
     ( 1 57)   Maria-n     n-jut    tu            be-yeo
               Maria-3SF 3SF-rasp coconut         Loc-outside
               Maria rasps coconut outside.
     There are a number of spatial nouns which can only follow the anchoring noun when they
themselves are marked with the preposition be. The whole locative phrase may be governed
by either be or by the locative prepositions ku 'to/at', ma 'in, at' and pu 'to/at.far.away' and si
'to'. Note that at the moment of speaking in such constructions instead of locative be, the
locative preposition ku 'to/at' expresses absence, ma presence. For example, in ( 1 58) and
( 1 59), instead of be, ma would have the aspectual meaning 'still present', and ku 'not present
anymore' (see also ยง9).
     Spatial nouns are shown in the following examples:
74      Cecilia Ode     ( 1 58)   Dwaw kon be        jan     be-nek.
               pig    sleep LOC house LOC-earth
               The pig sleeps under the house.
     ( 1 59)   Ba-ban       ut     be    tep be- u ?
               thing-what stay LOC plate Loc-inside
               What is inside the plate?
     ( 1 60)   A -jap     be     war dir be-am .
               3SM-live LOC river side LOC-side
               He lives at the other side of the river.

               3PL-smoke-3SM 3PL-put on       rack at fire-eye LOC-top
               They smoked him and put him on the rack over the fireplace.
     ( 1 62)   Tep fiti     n-dir         pu           beruk                 n-jun.
               plate other I SO-put on.far.away rack.over.fireplace 3sF-top
               The other plate I 'll put high up on top of the rack over the fireplace.
     ( 1 63)   N-fo           si jan      si-jun den-e.
               I SO-go.up to house to-top just-cL
               I 'll just go up to the house.
Note that in examples ( 1 60) and ( 1 6 1 ) am 'side' and am 'eye' have mid and high tone,
respectively.
   Besides ( 1 6 1 ) and ( 1 63) it is also possible to inflect jun 'top' with '3SF' in case an
anchoring noun is present, as in ( 1 62) and ( 1 64), or with '3SM ' when this is not the case
( 1 65).
     ( 1 64)   N-a         a-se        bari beruk a-ta        n-jun-i.
               I so-father 3SM-fall.to from rack 3SM-ANA 3SF-top-CL
               My father has fallen down from above the rack.
     ( 1 65)   An-tra   fe a -jun.
               2so-look to 3SM-top
               You look upwards.
     A similar contrast as between ( 1 64) and ( 1 65) seems to apply to postnominal be-nek in
( 1 66) and the adverbial a-nek in (1 67):
     ( 1 66)   A -jap be jan         be-nek.
               3SM-sit LOC house LOC-earth
               He sits under the house.
     ( 1 67)   Am-bru       a-nek       na e-un.
               2SO-descend 3SM-earth to I PL-go
               Please come down so that we can go.
   The prepositional phrase 'from . . . to .. .' uses directional preposition fe, used with spatial
nouns prefixed with a- '3SM ' : fe a -y-am 'to 3SM-Y-side' 'sidewards', fe a-wot 'to 3SM-sea'
'seawards' , je a-jun 'to 3SM-top' 'upwards'. The combination is as follows:
                                                                        A sketch ofMpur   75   (1 68)    A .kem    bad beruk n-jun fe a-nek.
             3SM-fall from rack 3SF-top to 3SM-earth
             He fell down from the top of the rack.","[27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"
"2 Phonology
   Mpur is a language with lexical tone contrasts. To my knowledge it is, together with the
neighbouring Abun language (Berry & Berry 1 999), the only Non-Austronesian tone
language in the Bird's Head area.
   A detailed phonology of Mpur by G. Kalmbacher is in preparation, of which a draft
(Kalmbacher 1 996) was kindly offered to me by the author. The data presented here do not
necessarily agree with all data in Kalmbacher's phonology. This is especially the case with
respect to word stress and the tone system, but differences will not be discussed. Full
responsibility for this short phonology is mine.",[4]
"14 Classifiers
   Mpur has a large number of classifiers that are obligatory in combination with numerals
which they precede. Though I don't know their exact number, I found over twenty different
classifiers. For example, bik for counting houses andfi for counting persons and animals:
   (226)    jan     bik    denur
             house CLF three
             three houses
   (227)     nton   firokir
                    fi-dokir
             child CLF-two
             two children
84      Cecilia Ode     Other examples of classifiers are:
     (228)       bo         long objects, such as sticks, poles
                 bwan       large-sized area
                 bwat       cutting tool
                 ja         seed, stone, grain, small round object
                 sum        for bananas (and other short-sized objects)
                 ur         woven item
     Examples are:
     (229)       mpan             urkir
                                  ur-dokir
                 sleeping.mat CLF.woven.item-two
                 two sleeping mats
     (230)       kaprur ja        onkir denur marnbrenur asen
                 peanut CLF ten          three    eight        plus
                 thirty-eight peanuts
   Measure nouns, such as tap 'bunch' , seem to function much like classifiers, such as sum
'short-sized object' , as compared in:
     (23 1 )     fa         tap    marnbrokir             vs       fa      sum marnbrokir
                 banana MEAS seven                                 banana CLF seven
                 seven hands of bananas                            seven (separate) bananas
   Some classifiers can also be found as a noun, for instance bik 'bamboo', or as a member
of a compound, for instance ja in:
     (232)       bi-ja-be
                 small.round.object-seed-fruit
                 testicles1 5 Relativisation and the form ma
     The form rna is observed in various languages of the Bird's Head area. Reesink
( 1 998:626ff.) discusses the different functions of mao To supplement his article I present
some other functions which rna has in Mpur, in addition to sections 7- 1 0 where the form has
also been discussed.
     My informants indicated that preposition rna 'at, to' and ma as relative marker have
different tones: high tone and mid tone, respectively. I analysed many examples of rna and
found that in both functions the tone realised in context fluctuates considerably; pronounced
in isolation I did not find any difference in tone: both were realised with mid tone. The form
is so frequently used, that a discrete difference in tone would have been noticed.
     For the time being, the different rna, which, in spite of native speakers' judgements, are
considered homophonous, to be distinguished are:
     (a)       as relative marker, introducing relative clauses;
     (b)       as relative marker in Headless RC, resembling a nominalising particle;
     (c)       on attributive adjectives in RC;
                                                                                    A sketch ofMpur    85   (d)     as marking demonstratives;
   (e)     in question words (examples (244}-(246));
   (f)     as preposition (example (247)).
   The different uses of rna indicated i n (a) to (d) will be discussed i n ยง 1 5. 1 , (e) and (f) in
ยง 1 5.2.","[39, 40, 41]"
"7 Deictics
   I n Mpur a distinction exists between spatial and textual deictics, the forms of which occur
in combinations as summarized in Table 4. As we will see, the deictic system is not a simple
issue at all. As said in my introduction, research carried out for the present article was
limited and does not answer many questions I still have, and the examples shown in this
section leave us with a great deal of uncertainty. Table 4 presents the forms of deictics:                          Table 4: Forms of spatial and textual deictics                            Spatial                                        Textual
         near             far                 very far         anaphoric        focus/topic
         ki               ka                  mek              ta(w)            ni
         n-ki             n-ka                                 (n)da(w)         (b)a-ni
         ma-n-ki          ma-n-ka
         na-ki            na-ka               na-mek
         ta-ki            ta-ka
         (b)a-ta-ki       (b)a-ta-ka          ba-ta-mek        (b)a-ta   The form mbano (mbana) was only attested as an independent utterance and therefore it
is not indicated in Table 4. Note that the form ba-ni is used in Amberbaken and, according
to my Kebar consultant, equivalent to the Kebar form ka-ni.
    Spatial deictics are expressed by the basic demonstrative pronouns ki 'here/this' and ka
'there/that' referring, respectively, to a distance near and a distance further away from the
speaker. The demonstratives are illustrated in the following example:
     (80)       Ah n-bwar ka      nan     pa          n-bwar   ki    an-bwar jan.
                ah I SG-say that you already I SG-say this 2SG-say             not
                Ah, I already told you, I said don't you say anything.
  The basic demonstratives ki and ka are frequently prefixed by what is likely the
morpheme n '3SF'. They are shown in three nominal clauses:
     (8 1 )     Baban n-ka?             N-ka        bak.        Bak n-ki       mafun jan.
                what 3SF-that           3SF-that axe            axe 3SF-this good not
                What is that?           That is an axe.         This axe is not good.
  If used attributively, the demonstrative pronouns ki 'this ' and ka 'that' are mostly
combined with the relative pronoun rna and the morpheme n '3SF':

             This rope is like a leaf of the coconut. (lit. This rope is a thing that is of
             a kind of leaf like a coconut.)
   (83)      M-fatot    m-fatot a-bwam           ma-n-ka             ti-prik-i       a-ut-i.

             She cuts till his head is broken off and he is dead.
   According to my informants the forms ma-n-ki and ma-n-ka rather than n-ki and n -ka
are used to refer to something that has not been communicated yet. For example in the
phrase ni ma-n-ki 'this tree', 'tree' is new information, whereas in ni n-ki 'this tree', the
existence of the tree was already known to the listener. Informants are not consistent in their
explanations; this has to be checked further. For a discussion about the many puzzling
functions of ma the reader is referred to ยง 1 5 .
   Next to (n-)ka 'there' a form mek 'there' exists. This demonstrative seems t o be used for
distances more remote than (n-)ka . Two examples are:
   (84)     Do-tek       ka        ne(k)-mek     arwar mek           do-y-aw.
            3DU-down that down-there stairs                 there    3DU-Y-run
            They went down the stairs and ran.
   (85)     N-kurem mamer a-ta                  bwan mum            mek.
            3SF-enter k.o.tree 3SM-ANA hole       deep there
            She went inside the deep hole of that mamer tree.
   The forms (n-)ka and (n-)ki and mek can be specified further with elements from textual
deictics and other forms. This is discussed below.
   Textual deixis is indicated by anaphoric ta and focus/topic marking ni, the latter most
likely of Numforese origin. Both can be prefixed with a- or ba-. For the time being, I
interpret a as '3SM ' ; but note that the origin of ba- seems to be bar 'thing', where intitial b- is
often omitted. The forms ba-ta, a-ta and ba-ni, as well as a number of more complex forms
(see below), occur equally frequently in my materials. A focus-marking form a-ni is in a
single case attested. Anaphoric ta can also be found in the free personal pronoun yeta '3SM'.
Sometimes ta is followed by a semivowel /w/: taw. The form nda 'that/there' does not occur
without n in my materials; it can also be followed by a final semivowel /w/: ndaw. A form
da is only attested with the meaning 'first, earlier', and as such is related to anaphoric ta o It
seems likely that nda consists of n '3SF' and anaphoric ta, where the initial stop is voiced
after n.
   Examples of textual deictics are presented in the following examples:
   (86)     Mamir ma          ut     a-ta           biasa       de-kum.
            person REL dead 3SM-ANA usually 3PL-smoke
            The people who are dead they usually smoked.

1.1 Background of the Mpur language    Mpur is a Non-Austronesian language with three lexical tones and is spoken by
approximately 5 ,000 speakers in the north east Bird's Head area, Irian Jaya, Indonesia. In
the literature Mpur is sometimes referred to as Kebar or Amberbaken, which are geographic
names for the two regions where it is spoken.
    Mpur is a phylum-level isolate with dialectal differences in at least lexicon and prosody
between speakers in the Kebar Valley, in the mountains (East Kebar) and on the coast
(Amberbaken), respectively. The lexicon is of Papuan origin, but morphology and syntax
show Austronesian features (Reesink 1 998 :603ff.), such as subject-verb-object word order
and the absence of heavy verb morphology. Many loans entered Mpur from Numforese,
Irianese Malay, Standard Indonesian, and also some from Dutch. I ndonesian is taught in
village schools by non-Mpur teachers, but they play truant as much as Mpur children do. In
town Mpur children learn I ndonesian more properly and only they are fairly able to
distinguish between Indonesian and Mpur words. Only a few Mpur speakers are literate in
Mpur, though much progress has been made in Kebar since G. and C. Kalmbacher (Irian Jaya
Bethany Foundation and Summer Institute of Linguistics) began to give literacy courses with
educational materials in the villages of that area; literacy in Indonesian is much better.
    Speakers of Mpur do not know the origin of the name Mpur. Coastal Mpur speakers refer
to Mpur speakers in the Kebar Valley as ma-ye 'who are outside' (lit. REL-outside), that is, at
the other side of the eastern Tamrau mountains. Kebar people call Papuan people maksam,
most likely from mam-kesam 'person from Irian' (lit. person-big.forest), in contrast to matem
'white people' from mam-war-tem 'person-mouth-river'. So far I have no explanation for the
term Mpur which is only used to refer to the language.
    The Mpur-speaking community has been extensively described by Miedema ( 1 9 84) and
many examples of their oral tradition have been published in M iedema ( 1 997). The story
Kaman ja 'Squash seeds', for the first time presented in this article, is an old story but a new
item to Miedema's collection.","[1, 2, 3]"
"4.3 Verb sequences
   Sequences of verbs are a common phenomenon in Mpur. They occur without any
conjunction and all verbs in such a sequence are finite and thus obligatorily inflected.
   There are a few criteria according to which sequences of verbs in Mpur actually could be
cases of verb serialisation: conjunctions do not occur between the verbs, a clause boundary
occurs only after the last verb, the subject is the same for all verbs, verbs may also occur
individually in a clause, verbs form together a prosodic group (no pauses between verbs, a
single intonation contour). Three examples are:
   (27)     Do-un     do-mim       do-fa        subwe      Ari-a a-tem.
            3D-go 3DU-arrive 3DU-ascend follow Ari               3SM-mouth
            They walk up along the River Ari till they reach its mouth.
   (28)     (Minton) kenep-i                 bwan pundir.
            (child)   look.around-CONf call      search
            (The children) looked around, they called and searched.
56      Cecilia Ode     (29)     Bari    nek   a-na       a-fa            arwar a-tao
              from down 3SM-come 3sM-ascend stairs           3SM-ANA
              From down he came up those stairs.
   It remains unclear whether sequences of verbs in Mpur are serial verb constructions or
coordinate constructions. I did not study the issue and a detailed discussion is also beyond the
scope of the present article.","[11, 12]"

    This research is part of ISIR (Irian Jaya Studies: a Programme for Interdisciplinary Research), a priority
    programme of NWO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research) which is financed by WOTRO
    (Netherlands Foundation for the Advancement of Tropical Research). The programme is carried out in
    cooperation with LIPI (Lembaga llmu Pengetahuan Indonesia). I wish to express my gratitude to Dr
    Hasan Alwi, head of the Pusat Pembinaan dan Pembangunan Bahasa, for his willingness to be my
    sponsor.
        I would like to thank the people of Kebar and Amberbaken for their friendship, confidence, teaching
    and help. Our long chats, gossips and discussions revealed some of their lifestyle and inspired my work.
    Through recordings on tape and video I still enjoy their beautiful voices full of suspense, humour, joy and
    sorrow. I feel especially grateful for what, in alphabetical order , Amanda Ajoi, Mince Jambuani, Mada
    Sapari and Seppy Wabia and their families have done for me to make my fieldwork such an impressive
    experience.
        I am greatly indebted to Greg and Carol Kalmbachers who, apart from their help on the Mpur
    language, offered me their Tarzan house in Anjai, Kebar, for a couple of months in 1 994 and 1 995.
48    Cecilia Ode1 .2 A personal note
   The present article is a sketch of Mpur. The main aim of my research was an experimental
phonetic study of prosody in Bird's Head languages, more specifically of Mpur and Abun.
Because of the time-consuming character of such studies, morphology and syntactics did not
get the attention it deserved. A description of Abun has recently been published (Berry &
Berry 1 999), but Mpur is still mostly a blank spot on the language map of the Bird's Head.
A phonology (Kalmbacher 1 996, MS), a limited wordlist and some other works have been
written by G. and C. Kalmbacher. Though a full description of the Mpur language was never
my intention, I nevertheless collected enough data to undertake the challenge of writing this
article, largely encouraged to do so by my fellow researchers. Yet quite a few issues remain
insufficiently described or explained, and in some cases that is even an understatement.
H owever, since I do have quite a bit of data from the language and since it is unlikely that
anyone else will study the language in detail soon, I have decided to present an analysis of
what I have collected so that the language will not remain completely undocumented except
for its phonetics.
   Data for this article were collected during three periods of fieldwork in 1 99 3-94, 1 995
and 1 998 in the Kebar valley and in Amberbaken. Apart from the work by G. and C.
Ka1mbacher mentioned above, which became accessible to me only later, no data on the
Mpur language were available. I worked intensively with Amanda Ajoi and Seppy Wabia in
Anjai, the Kebar Valley, and in Saukorem, Amberbaken, with Seppy Wabia, Markus Wabia,
Moses Warijo and a few other people. Twice I met the Kalmbachers in Kebar and discussed
many Mpur issues with them. For a study of the three dialects I visited lenderau (East
Kebar) and Nekori (over the mountains behind Jenderau) and along the Amberbaken coast
the villages from Arfu to Wau. In all areas mentioned I worked with indigenous inhabitants
of the villages and recorded their speech on tape.
   This article reflects the limitations explained above and will mainly present word classes,
morphological processes and, where this seems adequate, some syntactic information.","[3, 4]"
"2.5 Intonation   Some intonation patterns have been dealt with in Ode ( 1 996, 1 997). A description of
Mpur tones and intonation is still in progress and will be published separately. For the time
being only some limited notes on intonation are presented.
   A general tendency is observed to realise large pitch movements at prosodic boundaries (a
pause, silence, hesitation, reset), for which the final syllable is then lengthened. At the end of
declaratives pitch usually moves downwards. Interrogatives and continuations cannot be
expressed by intonation alone: interrogatives take question markers (ยง8) which have their
'own' tones, and enclitics are used to express a continuation (ยง 1 6). The importance of a word
in an utterance, as a means of accent, is highlighted by focus marker ni (see ยง7), by enclitics
or by repeating words (of most word classes), examples of which can be found in the text at
the end of this article. Enclitics especially have salient falling or rising pitch movements.
The expression of emotive emphasis has been described in Ode ( 1 997, 1 998).
52         Cecilia Ode3 Pronouns
3.1 Free and bound pronouns
   Mpur has free and bound pronouns. Bound pronouns are subject markers prefixed on
verbs and possessor markers prefixed on inalienable nouns. The free and bound forms are
presented below with an example on a prefixed verb and on an inalienable noun:
     (1)        Person        Free            Bound       Verb             Inalienable noun
                              pronoun         pronoun     jap 'to stay'    yen 'mother'
                I SG         in               (i)n-       n-jap            n-yen
                2S0          nan              an-         an-jap           an-yen
                3SM          yeta             a-          a-jap            a-yen
                3SF          men              n-          n-jap            n-yen
                I OU         war              (w)o-       o-jap            a-yen
                2DU          non              no(n)-      non-jap          no-yen
                3DU          dar              do-         do-jap           do-yen
                I PL         yek              e-          e-jap            e-yen
                2PL          nen              ne(n)-      nen-jap          ne-yen
                3PL          der              de-         de-jap           de-yen
  The final nasal of a bound form assimilates to the point of articulation of the stem-initial
consonant. Personal free pronouns preceding a verb with subject prefixation express
emphasis. For example (in the translation, the emphatic pronoun is capitalised):
     (2)        Yeta a -un      si    jan.
                3SM 3SM-go to         house
                HE will go home.
     (3)        Nton      nan an-jap.
                child 2S0 2S0-stay
                Child YOU stay.
  Personal free pronouns are used as verbal or prepositional object, without special
                                                                                                 I
emphasis, as in (4) and (5):
     (4)        A -from      nan.
                3SM-Iove 2S0
                He loves you.
     (5)        Am-bot      jetenon na men.
                2S0-give knife     to 3SF
                You give the knife to her.
     Examples of personal bound pronouns on verbs and on inalienable nouns are:
     (6)        Im-bwana in-un          si    in-aya    a-tar       jan.
                I SO-want I SO-go to I SO-father 3sM-possess house
                I want to go to my father's house.
     (7)        N-yen          n-am      pam.
                3SF-mother 3sF-eye pain
                Her mother's eye hurts.
                                                                        A sketch of Mpur 53   Bound pronouns can occur in object position as verbal suffix:
   (8)      War-(d)okwa-y-a.
            water-carry-Y-3SM
            The water carries him along.
   (9)      A-unsra       kutut      na men-dot         ma   n-nap-a.
            3SM-like because for 3SF-younger REL 3SF-husband-3SM
            He likes the younger girl to sleep with him.
    Note that the voiced alveolar stop Id/ is pronounced as [d) in word-initial position and after
nasal In!; otherwise it is pronounced as a voiced alveolar flap [r). In example (8) an elision of
initial Id/ of the verb dokwa 'to carry' occurs after war 'river'; an epenthetic glide -y- occurs
between verb-final -a and 3SM -a.","[7, 8, 9]"
"4.4 Verbaliser bi-
   The prefix bi- can be used for loans or words of other word classes to change the item into
a verb. For example:
     (30)     bi-rekam      to record (from Indonesian rekam)
              bi-paksa      to force (from Indonesian paksa)
              bijadi        to appear (from Indonesianjadi)
              bijadi ntan   to give birth to (from Indonesian jadi)
              bi-hanyat     to float (from Indonesian hanyat)
              bi-lewat      to cross (from Indonesian lewat)
              bi-undang     to invite (from Indonesian undang)
              bi-skap       to kick, hit (from Dutch schoppen)
              bi-ankar      to lie, to deceive (from NF ankar 'to deceive')
              bi-sik        to be unable (from Mpur adverb sik 'not.possible')
              bi-aka        to make possible (from Mpur conjunction aka 'so')
              bi-osum       to be funny, humorous (from Mpur sum 'spicy'?)
   On Mpur words, the verbaliser bi- is not always obligatory. Compare the following two
examples:
     (3 1 )   Aka men bani n-kon-e            m-bi-sik               pa.
              then 3SF that 3SF-sleep-CL 3sF-VBL-impossible already
              And then she was asleep, there was nothing more she could do.
     (32)     A -non-o      fi-rokir   de-mika   sik          de-mika      sik      wa.
              3SM-child-CL CLF-two 3PL-wait impossible 3PL-wait impossible already
              His two children could not wait, they could not wait anymore.
   As the following example shows, Mpur words from other word classes can be used as a
verb without the verbaliser bi- simply by taking subject prefixation:
     (33)     kum smoke            de-kum-a   they smoke him
4. 5 Causative verbal prefix fa-
   Mpur makes use of a verbal prefix, which is most likely of Numforese origin indicating a
causative, for instance fa-ur 'to extinguish' consisting of the causative fa- and the adverb ur
'extinguished'. Fa- can be prefixed to words from different word classes making it a
transitive verb. Some examples are:
                                                                         A sketch of Mpur 57   (34)    yep        dry                     fa-yep           to dry
           dubun      to pull                 fa-rubun         to pull out
           bum        fog, cloud              fa-bum           to hide
           jik        to kill                 fa-ji(k)-em      to argue (lit. cAus-kill-RECIP)
           brek       to turn                 fa-brek          to turn around, to capsize
   In a number of cases I do not know the origin of the stem of the transitive verb, for
instance fa-wop 'to close'. Note that Taba (South Halmahera) has ha-op CAUS-be covered 'to
cover' (John Bowden, pers. comm.). Some verbs like farkor 'to learn' and f(a)nander 'to
forget' are wholesale borrowings from Numforese (note that the vowel a of fa- is often
omitted).","[12, 13]"
"4.7 Emotive verbs with wa-
   There are a number of verbs expressing mental or physiological states with the initial
syllable wa-, mostly for negative feelings such as warmor 'to be angry', wanaw 'to be afraid',
wafnem 'to be lazy', waka 'to be jealous', wamar 'to be tired', wandar 'to be shy', wantek 'to
be ill '. The verb mom (see ยง4.6) also occurs with wa-: wamom 'to want not'. I have no
explanation yet for the origin of wa-. According to my language consultants the form wa
comes from wow 'body' or mwan 'face, appearance', for instance: wamar 'to be tired'
consists of wow-mar 'body-tired', wantek 'to be ill ' is claimed to be mwan-tek 'face-hot'.
   Two examples are:
58      Cecilia Ode     (39)     A-waka        In.
              3SM-jealous l SG
              He envies me.
     (40)     A-warmor      In.
              3SM-angry l SG
              He is angry with me.
  Other states of emotion are expressed by inalienable nouns indicating body parts with a
qualifying noun or adjective, as illustrated in the following examples:     (4 1 )   A-bwam-bit.
              3SM-head-stone
              He is naughty (lit. he has a head like a stone).
     (42)     A-bwa-ip.
              3SM -head-bone
              He is naughty (lit. he has a head like a bone).
     (43 )    A-wanken bapak.
              3SM-nose-big
              He is angry (lit. he has a big nose, also used in this literal meaning).
     (44)     A-unket pam.
              3SM -chest-painful
              He is furious, wild (lit. his chest hurts, also used in this literal meaning).","[13, 14]"
"
6.8 Nouns and word order
   Word order in noun phrases is as follows: P๏ฟฝS + N + A + NUM + DET, as in:
    (78)     A-onsra    a-hi         jan      mafun         fon.
             3SM-like 3SM-possess house beautiful           many
             He likes his many beautiful houses.
64      Cecilia Ode   A modifying relative clause (see ยง 1 5) is normally introduced by the relative marker ma,
occupying the position of the postnominal modifiers. I n the following example, a nominal
predication is presented followed by a negation which obligatorily follows the nominal
predicate:     (79)       Iw    ma-n-ka         kokor    jan.
                bird REL-3SF-that chicken NEG
                This bird is not a chicken.","[19, 20]"
"3.2 Reflexivity
   Reflexivity is expressed by means of free pronouns. It can be emphasised by do 'self,
alone', which has subject prefixation and often occurs in combination with numeral tu 'one'
to express exclusivity. Examples of the two expressions of reflexivity are:
   ( 1 0)   In-tik-war              in.
            I SG-bathe-water I SG
            I wash myself.
   (1 1)    An-unan nan da.
            2SG-ask 2SG first
            Ask yourself first (think before you act).
   ( 1 2)   A-jik         a -roo
            3SM-kill 3SM-self
            He killed himself.
   ( 1 3)   In-do         in-i             na n-tera.
            I SG-self I SG-stand to I SG-see
            I stood (there) myself to see (it).
   ( 1 4)   Yeta a-ro              a-jap     be-jun.
            3SM 3SM-self 3SM-sit on-top
            He alone sits on top.
   ( 1 5)   In-frur in-do-tu.
            1 SG-do   1 SG-self-one
            I do it by myself.
   ( 1 6)   A     n-aya             an-do-tu      an-mam       an-mam       mer
            ah    I SG-father       2SG-self-one 2SG-cut.down 2SG-cut.down garden
            ma      bapak.
            REL   big
            Well, father, you have to clear that big garden by yourself.
54      Cecilia Ode4 Verb
   Subject prefixation for person and number on verbs (see ยง3) is obligatory only with human
subjects, but note that (mi)nton 'child ', mamir 'person ', nkan 'old person ' , mampu
'youngster', maunbwat 'thief' etc. do not trigger subject prefixation if the speaker does not
know the gender. The word order in verbal clauses is SVO.","[9, 10]"
"
5 Adjectives
   There are reasons for positing a separate word class of adjectives distinct from either
verbs or nouns, although Mpur adjectives do have some similarities with Mpur verbs. Both
verbs and adjectives take subject prefixation in predicative position. In attributive position
verbs require the relativiser ma following the noun and preceding the prefixed verb.
Adjectives in attributive position occur with and without the relativiser mao
   Some examples of adjectives, including the five terms for colours, are:

             ufrum      yellow
             bwa-wop    green, blue (lit. leaf + ?)
60      Cecilia Ode   Note that there are three more names for yellow: minam (in the mountains also used for
white), dapraw and bwa-bin (lit. ripe-leaf). Colours can be further specified by using the
adverbs dera or pit 'bright' which are only used for colours and by berep 'light' and dim
'dark', which all follow the name of the colour. The word for azure, for instance, is bwawop
dera 'bright green ' and the word for 'pink' is sum berep. To indicate the intensity of a
colour, the adverbs ten 'just' and tati, kaku 'very' are used: sum ten 'reddish', sum tati 'very
red'.
   Adjectives follow the noun and can be specified with relative marker ma as shown in (53).
The relative marker ma occurs on attributive adjectives as in (53), but also introduces relative
clauses and occurs as relative marker in Headless RC. For a further discussion of ma see
ยง1 5.
     (53)    jan mafun      a beautiful house jan ma mafun the house which is beautiful
             kwap kot       a heavy bag       kwap ma kot the bag which is heavy

             babwa minyar delicious vegetable
             bertobar serer a long story
   A number of adjectives occur in predications as verbs with subject prefixation. Examples
are:
     (54)     In-tek.
              lSG-hot
              I am hot (to be translated as 'I feel cold', shivering from fever).
     (55)     A-rot.
              3SM -younger
              He is younger.
     Indefinite numerals (see ยง 1 3.3) behave as adjectives as shown in:
     (56)     A-men            per fon.
              3SM-look.after dog many
              He looked after many dogs.","[15, 16]"

15.1 Relative clauses   In example (23 3) rn a introduces a restrictive relative clause, which is always in
postnominal position (see ยง6.8):
   (233)     M-bot         pek         rna   rnuk       tak          na kur.
             3SF-give worm REL name k.o.wood to                         snake
             She gave the snake worms called tak.
  In examples (234}-(236) rna is a relative marker in a Headless RC, resembling a
nominalising particle:
   (234)     In      rna      rn-bep                    nton.
              1 SG REL 1 SG-carry .in.cloth child
             I am the one who carries the child.
   (235)     Kurito-n         n-jap      ku rna      yep-i.
             Kurito-3SF 3SF-sit on REL dry-CL
             Kuriton sits on the dry one.
   (236)     rna-barr)-kwar
             REL-thing-sharp
             criminal
  Single adjectives may occur in a RC construction introduced by rna, as shown in (237), as
opposed to a direct modifying function, as illustrated in (238):
   (237)     Jan        rna    rnafun        irn-frur         jan.
             house REL beautiful l SG-make not
             The house which is beautiful I did not build.
   (238)     Irn-frur      jan     rnafun.
             l SG-make house beautiful
             I built a beautiful house.
   As marking demonstratives rna is illustrated in (239}-(24 l ):
   (239)     Nton     rna-n-ka           a-rnuk          Fentor-a.
             child REL-3SF-this 3SM-name Fentor-3SM
             This child's name is Fentori.
   (240)     De-jap      ku rna-n-ka                ni        Fentor-a-o        a-jap   beraw   der.
             3PL-live at REL-3sF-there FOC Fentor-3SM-CL 3SM-live with                          3PL
             They live there and Fentori lives there too with them.

               What did you put in your bag?
     The relative pronoun rna obligatorily precedes verbs that are used attributively:
     (242)     Nton rna     kon        wantek.
               child REL sleep ill
               The sleeping child is ill.
     (243 )    Dwaw rna         aw      ut     jan-to.
               pig    REL run dead not-yet
               A running pig is not yet dead.","[41, 42]"
"
11.2 Adverbs of time   Generally speaking, adverbs referring to time occur in clause-initial position:
   ( 1 73)   Sobon-i     n-jap    ku Manokwar.
             before-CL 3sF-live in Manokwari
             Before she lived in Manokwari.
   ( 1 74)   Bitu        nen-suma      biskwan         braw mwan.
             in.a.while 2PL-receive sago.porridge with fish
             In a while you'll get sagoporridge with fish.
   ( 1 75)   Tokiri                men musim fiti       n-ut.
             day.before.yesterday 3SF woman certain 3SF-dead
             The day before yesterday a woman has died.
76      Cecilia Ode   Note that 'today' and different parts of the day are expressed by combinations of those
parts with the demonstrative manki 'this', such as put manki 'day this' for 'today', or tot
manki 'evening this' for 'tonight', etc. Reduplications (of word combinations) like, for
instance, put tu put tu 'day one day one' for 'always' or kiti kiti 'sometimes' are also used.
However, with a few exceptions, hardly any reduplication is found in Mpur. Parts of the day
of yesterday, tomorrow etc. follow the temporal adverb:
     ( 1 76)    Dosir     tot      in-bwana m-bwar na nan.
                tomorrow evening I SG-want I SG-talk to 2SG
                Tomorrow evening I want to talk to you.
     Some other temporal and morphologically complex adverbs are:
     ( 1 77)    nunki       later today
                nuni        earlier today
               dosir        tomorrow
                nur         day after tomorrow
                nton        yesterday
                tokiri      day before yesterday
                torwari     a few days ago
                torenur     three days ago
                torbwati    four days ago
               femuki       now, nowadays
                kiti kiti   sometimes
                tekeki      a while ago
                bitu        in a while
                toren       recently, just
               suba         a long time
               firoko       daybreak
     To the adverbs of time also belong some adverbial phrases, as in:
     ( 1 78)   A -rin     fanam ka               firoko.
               3SM-dance close      aUhe.time.of daybreak
                He dances till daybreak.
     ( 1 79)    Bat-ip      enon jan-i bwansan bi-tutup        sor.
                beat-wind? little not-CL cloud       VBL-close mountain
                Not much later clouds cover the mountains.
    There are no indigenous words for ' week', 'month' or 'year'. Mpur speakers use
I ndonesian words, but for 'year' the compound bra-n-ka-wa is sometimes used, from
classifier bra for long things, demonstrative pronoun n-ka '3SF-that' and aspect adverb pa
'already'. For 'month' the form man is used from the Dutch loan maand.","[31, 32]"
"
1 1.8 To be or be not: the presentative mu   The presence or existence of something is expressed by the presentative mu with verbs like
ut 'to stay', i 'to stand', jap 'to sit' or kon 'to lie, sleep'. The word class it belongs to is not
80      Cecilia Odeclear to me, so for the time being the presentative is discussed in this final section on adverbs.
The most frequent use is in combination with the verb ut 'to stay' forming the compound
construction umu and with the demonstratives ka 'that.there' and ki 'that.here'. Mu is always
preceded by a verb. Though its use is not yet clear to me, the presentative is shown in a few
examples:
     (205)      Fentor-a      a-I            mu-ki           pa.
                Fentor-3SM 3SM-stand present-here already
                Fentori is here already.
     (206)      Nek      tapok ut       ma    Jam-bwan-a           a-muk   u(t)-mu.
                earth high      stay at      clock-calI-3SM 3SM-tail stay-present
                A hill at the foot of the lambuani mountain still exists.
     (207)      Derek-a        a-jap      mu-ka.
                Derek-3SM 3SM-stay present-there
                There is Derek.
     (208)      Mwan ut        ma      war mu-ki-e?
                fish    stay in      river present-this-Q
                Is here any fish in the river?
     (209)      Watini     kon mu-ka-e?
                cassava lie   present-that-Q
                Are there cassava?
     (2 1 0)    Amanda-n        m-wamar-e? In-unot             jan Amanda-n       m-wamar(o)-mu.
                Amanda-3SF 3SF-tired-Q        I SG-know not Amanda-3SF            3SF-tired-present
                I s Amanda tired? I don't know whether she is tired.
  In examples (208) and (209) in the form m u-ka-e and mu-ki-e, ka and ki may be omitted:
mu-e 'present-Q ' . The negation of mu is ku jan 'at not' or (n-)ka jan '(3SF-)there not', as in:
     (2 1 1 )   Be    n-do     n-kopaw       bar     doku     be mamir ku jan-e.
                but I SG-seJf I SG-chop thing in.vain but person at not-CL
                But I myself chopped things for nothing, there is nobody.
     (2 1 2)    Fentor-a       n-ka       jan.
                Fentor-3SM 3SF-there not
                Fentori is not there.","[35, 36]"

1 3 Quantifiers
13.1 Cardinal numbers
     The numeral system is a base-five system. There are cardinals for one to five:
                    1        tu
                    2        dokir
                    3        denur
                    4        bwat
                    5        me
  Cardinals six to nine are most likely combinations of mam-bi 'five-plus', with the
numerals one to four; a possible explanation for the form mam is ma-me 'REL-five' : maยญ
m(e)-bi tu REL five-plus one'. These cardinals are as follows:
          -     '       -             -
                    6        mambitu
                    7        mambrokir
                    8        mambrenur
                    9        mambibwat
     In the term for cardinal ten at least the numeral (do)kir 'two' can be recognised:
                10           onkir
    The cardinals from eleven to ninety-nine follow this system regularly, using          asen 'plus'
for each higher number:
                11           onkir tu asen
                12           onkir dokir asen
                etc.
                20           onkir kir
                21           onkir kir tu asen
                etc.
                30           onkir denur
                etc.
     The numeral for hundred is of Numforese origin. Its combinations are as follows:
                1 00         untin tu
                101          untin tu tu asen
                etc.
   There is no numeral for thousand, for which the Indonesian word ribu is used, also
regularly following the numeral system:
               1 000         ribu tu
               1 00 1        ribu tu tu asen
                                                                       A sketch of Mpur 8313.2 Ordinal numbers   The ordinal numbers are compounds o f saso 'time' and a cardinal number. For example:
            sasotu         time one, once
            sasorokir      time two, second
            sasorenur      time three, third
   An exception is the ordinal saji 'first, once, first time':
   (222)    Saji n-jap       ku Anja .
            once lSG-live in Anjai
            Once I lived in Anjai.
   Note that in example (222) ku is the only possible preposition with the aspectual meaning
'not anymore' (see ยง9).","[38, 39]"
"6.5 Inalienable nouns  Inalienable nouns include terms for body parts, kinship relations and a few other items,
which require a prefix signalling for person and number of the possessor:

"16 Clitics
   Clitics are monosyllabic morphemes attached to lexical words of different classes, but
usually not on prepositions. Clitics are meaningful elements and in Mpur frequently have a
salient intonation and syllable lengthening. All clitics are enclitics which modify a word, a
clause or a whole utterance. The interrogative clitic -e is discussed separately in ยง7. The
same form is used with an apparently different function. The other clitics -a, -i, -0 function
in discourse as, for instance, vocatives, continuation, focus and temporal markers, as
expression of (emotive) emphasis. It is hard to tell the different meanings of the clitics apart,
and I did not study the issue thoroughly enough to explain the differences. Working on the
translations of texts, Mpur informants were often unable to indicate what a given clitic
means. Despite this some examples are presented below.
   Clitic -a occurs as a vocative for persons: nen-a! 'Mum-voc!'. It is used to call someone
who is not far away (otherwise -0 is used, see below):
                                                                                 A sketch of Mpur 87  (248)     Amanda-n-a!
            Amanda-3SF-VOC
            Amanda !
  Another example of -a is illustrated in the following sentence:
  (249)     Men n-do            n-aw        bem     nton-a       nton-a     are jap.
            3SF 3SF-self 3SF-run from child-CL child-CL thus stay
            She herself ran away from the child and so the child stayed behind.
  Note that clitic -a must not be confused with object marker -a '3SM ' :
  (250)     De-kum-a              de-rir      baku beruk ku yet-am be-jun.
            3PL-smoke-3SM 3PL-put on      rack at fire-eye on-top
            They smoked him and put him on the rack over the fireplace.
  Clitic -e, mainly attached to verbs, indicates that the event went on for a long time, as in:
  (25 1 )   Yet sop-e.

   Clitic -i occurs very frequently. In general it emphasises the word it is attached to, as
shown in:

  Clitic -i occurs on all different word classes, as illustrated in the following examples:

   Clitic -a attached to the final word of an utterance or to a name as a vocative (see also
example (248ยป is used when speaker and listener are at some distance from one another and
speaking becomes almost calling, as for example in:
     (26 1 )   Nen       war mbana-y-a.
               mama lDU I SG-here-Y-CL
               'Mum and I are here.'
   Furthermore, clitic -a is used in enumerations of objects or events which can all take -a,
the first -a anticipating that there is more to come, as in the following example:
     (262)     E-tiw           menap-a      mwan-a kerer-a               kataw-a.

               Taboo for us is catfish and fish and couscous and rat.
     Another use of clitic -a meaning 'also' is shown in:
     (263)     N-tan      pa        n-kete-a            pa         be nen-kat.

recorded on digital tape and on video in the village of Saukorem on the north-east coast of
the Bird's Head, 1 6 March 1 994.
    Notational conventions are as follows. Underlined text is Saukorem dialect, bold text is
Indonesian. Loans from Numforese are indicated with (NF), but not all entries have been
checked against the Numforese vocabulary. Semivowel insertion between vowels is indicated
with Y. First lines present the original text in italics, second lines the analysis in morphemes,
third lines the free English translation. The speech rate changes in the course of the story.
When in the original text syllables are swallowed and morphemes cannot be recognised
anymore, an extra line is added in italics below the original text as if it were pronounced in
careful speech. Vowels or consonants that are not pronounced are presented in parentheses.
Stem-initial Idl preceded by a prefix ending in a vowel is pronounced as [r]; this may also
occur in connected speech if a preceding word ends in a vowel. In the text I followed the
actual pronunciation of Idl as [d] or as [r]. Likewise I followed the pronunciation of wordยญ
initial In! before bilabials as [m] and of fbi in the deictic elements (a)bata and bani where fbi
can be pronounced as [w]. Duration of pauses between utterances is indicated in seconds
between square brackets on the first line. For the convenience of the author's administration,
utterances are numbered according to the sound files as they were stored for analysis in the
computer.

1 1. 5 Adverbs of mode    Adverbs of mode tend to occur clause-finally, at least post-predicate, following the object
if that is expressed. Adverbs of mode refer to the (im)possibility, necessity etc. of the event
expressed by the verb. Such adverbs are sik/tasik 'impossible, useless , fari 'possible/able.to',
                                                                         'as in:

example:
   (1 98)    Men-dot       nap-a-i            a-kon      tot     fan    jan.
             3sF-younger copulate-3sM-CL 3sM-sleep night much not
             The younger sister copulates with him continuously, he doesn't sleep
             much at night.
   (1 99)    A -put    a-put-e        kwaik kaku .
             3SM-fill 3SM-fill-CL strong very(NF)
             He kept on filling (the hole) till it was tight enough.
   Other intensifying adverbs are:
   (200) famber              very, too
             fon famber      very much
             tati            very
             ten             only
1 1 .7 Adverb of negation   The adverb of negation jan always occurs clause-finally. For example:
   (20 1 )   De-unot     Seppi-a     a-jap   ku Bwatem      jan.
             3PL-know Seppi-3SM 3SM-live in Saukorem not
             They don't know whether Seppy lives in Saukorem.rrhey know that Seppy
             does not live in Saukorem.
   This utterance can be disambiguated by positioning the negative element directly following
the predicate of the main clause:
   (202)     De-unot jan Seppi-a a-jap         ku Bwatem.
             3PL-know not Seppy     3sM-live in Saukorem
             They don't know whether Seppy lives in Saukorem.
   Other examples are (203) and (204), in which two clauses are coordinated by constrastive
be 'but'. The negative adverb has to be in final position of the clause under its scope.
   (203)     In-ton bajarek jan be bijam.
              1 SG-cut bamboo not but ironwood
              I don't cut bamboo but ironwood.
   (204)     In-ton bajarek be bijam         jan.
              1 SG-cut bamboo but ironwood not

phenomenon that is characteristic of at least other Papuan languages spoken in the Bird's
Head area, is an utterance final voiceless velar with strong nasal aspiration, which is released
only hundreds of milliseconds after a final vowel. It has been attested for M aybrat by Dol
(1 999:45).
   The large scale of phonetic variations of vowels in different positions or under the
influence of morphophonemic processes, vowel elision and vowel shortening or lengthening
will not be described here.",[5]

6.6 Gender
   Female personal names are suffixed with -n: Amandan, Mincen, Marian 'Amanda,
Mince, Maria '. M ale personal names are suffixed with -a : Seppia, Mosesa, Lamberta
'Seppy, Moses, Lambert'.
   Other examples of nouns with gender indication are:
   (73)      yen         mother
             a           father
             nton        girl, woman (of all ages); child

             nzman       girlfriend
             nimata      boyfriend
  Note that nton is the generic form for 'child', which suggests that female -n indicates the
unmarked form.",[19]

1 1.3 Adverbs of aspect   A number of adverbs specify aspectual meanings of the clause and usually follow the
predicate and object (if present). Some examples are:

             2sG-bath-sea all.the.time for what
             Why are you bathing (in the sea) all the time?
Note that the complex question na ban 'why?' may occur in clause-final position after the
adverb of time.
   The adverb pa 'already' preceded by isi 'enough, finished, ready', and usually followed by
be 'but', marks an action that has been completed insufficiently or unsatisfactorily. For
example:
   (1 88)    In-det bar-(d)et isi          pa      be in-diwor jan-to.
             l SG-eat thing-eat enough already but l SG-full not-yet
             I have eaten but I am still not full.
   Other adverbs of aspect are:
   ( 1 89)   donin      always
             janpa      not anymore
             janto      not yet

             menit      completely, sufficiently
             sukem      usually, always
78      Cecilia Ode   A sufficiently completed action is expressed by the adverbial phrase menit pa 'enough
already' or maw pa 'finished already'.","[32, 33, 34]"
"   Another form for 'here' is na-k(i) 'to-here', where the final high front vowel -i is mostly
lost, shown in the following example:
   (101)     An-dak          bain     ma-n-te?       Na-k(i).
             2sG-make garden at-3SF-where to-here
             Where are you making a garden? Right here.
   There also exists a form for 'here' whose internal structure is not clear yet: mbano
(sometimes mbana), used for something visible quite near the speaker and listener:
   ( 1 02)   Tep ma-n-te?             Mbano.
             plate at-3SF-where right.here
             Where is the plate? Right here (in front of you).

             Where are you (I can hear you but I don't see you)? I am right here.",[23]
"9 Prepositions   Prepositions in Mpur have no subject prefixation. For the purpose of this exposition,
prepositions are subdivided into three types: ( 1 ) referring to space, (2) referring to space with
an aspectual meaning, and (3) non-spatial prepositions. Such a subdivision may not be
tenable, since the preposition na 'for, to', mainly used with verbs like 'say' and 'give', also
occurs with demonstratives. Some prepositions also occur as verbs (see below). The
discussion of locative prepositions be andfe is delayed till ยง1 0.
   The prepositions presented below in alphabetical order will be commented upon in this
section:
   (1 1 9)   bari       from
             be         LOC (see ยง 1 O)
             fe         LOC (see ยง 1 0)
             fraru      between (lit. 'middle ')
             ka         with (instrument)
             ke         to (in the process of going to)
             koso       along
             ku         to, at, in (completed action)
             ma         to, at, in (habitual, permanent or actual presence)
             mim        till
             na         for, to
             pu         to, at, in (far away)
             si         to (future action)
              tut       with (comitative)
   Examples of the three types are, respectively:
   ( 1 20)   In-un     koso    war.
              I SG-go along river
              I walk along the river.
70      Cecilia Ode     (121)     N-un      ku Akmur.
               3SF-go to Akmuri
               She has been to Akmuri.
     ( 1 22)   Am-bot         jetenon na       in.
               2S0-give knife      to    I SO
               You give the knife to me.
    Spatial prepositions are ke 'to', ku 'to, at, in', ma 'to, at, in', pu 'to, at, in', si 'to', koso
'along (a combination of ku and si?)' and, in fixed combinations with words expressing
spatial orientation, be andfe. The latter two will be discussed in ยง 1 0. Prepositions ku and pu
can take the prefix ba-: ba-ku, ba-pu . As mentioned in ยง7, I have no explanation for ba-.
    The meaning of preposition pu 'to, at, in ' is said to have the meaning 'tolat far away',
illustrated in the following examples:
     ( 1 23)   M-bi-jadi                 nton sok     are    n-jap   pu          jan-i-kem.
               3SF-VBL-give.birth child new so           3SF-stay at.far.away house-CL-fall
               She'll give birth to a new child, so she stays at a far away birth-house.
     ( 1 24)   De-un     pu               si     a-Jam-a.
               3PL-go to.far.away to 3SM-brother.in.law-3SM
               They go far away to his brother-in-law.
     ( 1 25)   Tep     fiti      n-dir     pu               beruk            n-jun.
               plate other I SO-put on.far.away rack.over.fireplace 3SF-top
               The other plate I 'll put high up on top of the rack over the fireplace.
   With verbs of motion, the prepositions ke, ku, ma, si 'to' acquire an aspectual meaning:
ke 'in the process of going to', ku 'completed action' (having arrived and come back), ma
'habitual, permanent presence', and si 'future action' . The four prepositions for 'to' are
presented in the following examples:
     ( 1 26)   A -un      ke Bwatem.
               3SM-go to Saukorem
               He is on his way to Saukorem.
     ( 1 27)   A-un       ku niraw.
               3SM-go to forest
               He has been to the forest (and is back now).
     (1 28)    A-un       ma Manokwar.
               3SM-go to Manokwari
               He has gone to Manokwari (e.g. he has moved there and lives there now).
     ( 1 29)   A-mim           jan       ba-pu          Asit.
               3SM-arrive house ?-at.far.away Asiti
               He arrives at his house far away in Asiti.
     ( 1 30)   A -un      si    war.
               3SM-go to river
               He will go to the river (he has not yet gone or he has not yet arrived there).
                                                                                   A sketch of Mpur 7 1  I n combination with verbs that do not express motion, for example jap 'to sit, live',
dakbar 'to work ', the preposition ma indicates a more permanent physical presence, while ku
conveys a more temporary meaning.
   (1 3 1 )   N-jap      ku Anja.                 vs          N-jap    ma Anja .
              3SF-live in Anjai                               3SF-live in Anjai
              She lives in Anjai.                             She has her living in Anjai.
  The aspectual meaning of the prepositions ku and ma is also reflected when used in
combination with question marker -te 'where' (see also ยง8):
   ( 1 32)    An-jap      ku-te?         In-jap        ku war.
              2SG-stay to-where I SG-stay at river
              Where have you been? I have been to the river.","[25, 26, 27]"

              ah person 3SF-ANA already
              Ah, somebody is there.
   The deictic system in M pur shows a large number of complex forms consisting of
elements of spatial and textual deictics. The demonstratives ki, ka and mek can be further
specified and be prefixed with anaphoric (b)a-ta, with what is likely the preposition na 'to,
for', and they can be suffixed with topic/focus marker ni. All these forms can occur as
object of a preposition. The combinations are shown in the examples below:     (9 1 )   Seluruh yen         ba-ta-mek              n-ketet       sik.
              all      needle ?-ANA-there 3SF-release impossible
              She could not release (it) with any needle over there at all.

              oh thing come-there abandoned already-Y-CL
              Oh, everything there was abandoned.",[22]
"
11 Adverbs
   On the basis of meaning and function, adverbs can be subdivided into types of location,
time, aspect, mode and negation. Adverbs do not take prefixes or suffixes and occur in
clause-initial and/or in clause-final position. Adjectives such as mambom 'lazy', frenkak
'wrongly', mafun 'beautifully' etc., can be used adverbially, as can NPs, like put manki 'day
this' for 'today' . Examples are:
  (1 69)     A-mambom a-tum            dwaw.
             3sM-Iazy    3SM-shoot pig
             He shoots badly at the pig (that is, he misses).
   (1 70)    A -frur bar frenkak.
             3SM-do thing wrong
             He does things (cooking, writing etc.) wrongly.",[31]
"8 Questions   Questions are marked morphologically. Though questions are not expressed by means of
intonation alone, question-marking clitic -e is realised with a salient, large rising or falling
pitch movement.",[23]
"4.1 Simple and compound verbs
    Simple verbs are verbs consisting of one single stem, for instance bot 'to take, fetch' (also:
'to give' in conjunction with the preposition na 'to'). Compound verbs are verbs that consist
of a combination of two verbs, for instance unot 'to know' which is made up of the two verbs
un 'go' and wot 'see'; berto 'tell' from ber 'talk ' and dito 'tell '; konot 'dream' from kon
'sleep' and wot 'see'.
    Regular verb paradigms are the following:
     ( 1 7)                       bot 'to give'     aw 'to run'      unot 'to know'

              I don't know the name of that wood.",[10]
"2.3 Tones     On the basis of an experimental phonetic approach, described in, for example, Ode
( 1 996), three tones have been attested in Mpur: high, mid and low. The issue still is whether a
fourth midrising tone, existing on the perceptual level, is phonologically significant. The
analysis in progress of the results of a last set of experiments is expected to answer this
question.
     Generally speaking, the range between high and low, expressed on a logarithmic scale, can
be up to twelve semitones, which in musical terms is equivalent to one octave. But note that
tones and intonation in speech are not perceived on the same logarithmic scale as music (Ode
1 996: note 1 0). The range between high and low in absolute terms, that is, expressed in
hertz, is of course speaker dependent. Tone sandhi, the influence of tones on the realisation
of adjacent tones, is a normal phenomenon in Mpur that together with other tonal and
intonational phenomena will be described in Mpur tones and intonation: an experimental
phonetic analysis with interlinearized texts (Ode, in process). Downdrift (i.e. in a sequence
of high-low-high tones, the latter high tone is lower than the former) and downstep (i.e. the
phonological lowering of the second of two tones of the same type) are not observed in Mpur.
In spontaneous speech there can be some declination (i.e. the fundamental frequency declines
gradually in the course of an utterance). See also Ode ( 1 996:86).
     Table 3 presents the three lexical tones with phonetic specification, that is, the level of the
tone in semitones (ST) measured above the lowest (zero semitones) level of a register of
twelve semitones of a speaker, and examples. These are maximum values. The actual
realisation of tones can be higher or lower than indicated in the table, depending on utterance
position, melodic context, tone sandhi, intonation and the idiosyncrasy of the speaker. High
and low tones are marked with ' and ' , respectively, on vowels; mid tone remains unmarked.

example, [p 'bone' and [p 'strong', ka 'to bark ' and ka 'that'.","[6, 7]"
"12 Conjunctions
   There are simple (aka 'and then', 'so') and complex (na toka 'in order to') conjunctions
that link clauses. For example:
     (2 1 3)    An-un      si bain-e     aka an-det         bar-(d)et!
                2SG-go to garden-Q then 2SG-eat thing-eat

             Tomorrow you'll make a big sleeping mat so that I can have sex with the two
             of you.
  Other conjunctions are:
   (2 1 5)   aka          and then, so
             are          and so, therefore
             be           but

             na           for, (in order) to
             tetate       therefore
   Conjunctions such as braw 'and', kanik 'like', na 'for, to' can also conjoin NPs, like
Irinan braw Florian 'Irina and Flora '. The conjunctions aka indicating a sequence, are
indicating a cause-result relationship, and mintaki occur very frequently in storytelling. A
few examples are:
   (2 1 6)   Do-si        mer-i     aka          Babwafe-a        a-bwana   a-supur.

             3SM-ill      so   3SM-go to garden not
             He is ill, so he will not go to the garden.
    The conjunction mintaki can occur either in initial or in final position of an utterance and
is a general discourse-cohesive conjunction with the meaning 'having arrived at this point of
the story, things were like that' and anticipating that things are yet to come. The form is
illustrated in the following examples:
   (220)     Min-ta-ki       pu-tu        n-un        na m-ba       njep.
             like-ANA-this day-one 3sF-go for 3SF-split firewood
             And so one day she went to cut firewood.
82      Cecilia Ode     (22 1 )        A -bat           a-ro       ku ter   min-ta-ki.

11.1 Adverbs of location  Adverbs of location follow the predicate with(out) object and indicate where the action
expressed by the verb takes place. For instance:
   (171)     A-jap      bwaner.
             3SM-live far
             He lives far away.
   The adverbfanam also occurs as verb and takes subject prefixation:
   (1 72)    Do-un      do-fanam mer-i                      do-bwanjar per.
             3DU-walk 3DU-close uncleared.garden-CL 3DU-call                dog
             They walk till they are close to the garden and call the dogs.",[31]

2.2 Syllable structure and phonotactics   The syllable structure in monosyllabic words is as follows:
50    Cecilia Ode            v                                 to stand
            CV                 pa             already
            VC                 am             eye
            CVC                kur            snake
   Consonant clusters do not occur in syllable-final position and are rare in syllable-initial
position, except C + semivowel. One can even question whether initial consonant clusters are
in fact the result of vowel elision, as, for example, in from 'think ', and thus not
monosyllables.
   In polysyllabic words, consonant and vowel clusters occur over syllable boundaries:
            v-v                a-i             he stands
            CV-V               ma-u            continually
            V-VC               e-un            we go
            CV-VC              ba-um           people
            CCV-VC             kwa-ik          strong
            CVC-CVC            ben-kan         papaya
            V-VC-CVC           a-un-sek        wrong
   Sequences of consonants and vowels, also over syllable or morpheme boundaries, are
subject to complex rules of constraints. As stated earlier, I will not go into details.","[5, 6]"

4.2 Transitive and intransitive verbs
   Transitive verbs can, but need not always, have an object, whereas intransitive verbs
cannot have a direct object, but can have an object with a preposition.
   The verb det 'to eat' is an example of a transitive verb and requires at least the object bar
'thing' :
     (20)     An-det bar-(d)et        pa-e?
              2SG-eat thing-eat alreadY-Q
              Have you already eaten?
                                                                        A sketch of Mpur      55   Verbs like minsa 'to hunt', nkwan 'to cook ', din 'to play' and dokwa 'to carry' are also
transitive and cannot occur without an object, unless the latter is easily recovered from the
context:
   (2 1 )   N-nkwan     sukwan.
            3 SF-cook sago.porridge
            She cooks sago porridge.
   (22)     A-bwana     a-rokwa       In.
            3SM-want 3sM-carry l SG
            He wants to carry me.
   In example (2 1 ) subject prefix n- 'she' is a syllabic nasal which is only audible in careful
speech.
   Examples of intransitive verbs are tikwar 'to bathe' and kwem 'to fall':
  (23)      Kutu(t)-ba(n ?) an-tik-war          jan-to?
            for-what      2SG-bathe-water       not-yet
            Why haven't you bathed yet?
   (24)     De-kwem bari       baprek.
            3PL-fall from bridge
            They fall from the bridge.
    Transitive verbs may occur without an object. Examples with and without objects are
illustrated in (25) and (26):
   (25)     Derek-a      a-onsra      nan.     vs         Derek-a    a-onsra .
            Derek-3SM 3SM -like 2SG                       Derek-3SM 3SM-likes(it)
            Derek likes you.                              Derek is happy.
   (26)     An-pin             jan!            vs         A-pin            Derek-a.
            2sG-call.names not                            3SM -call. names Derek-3SM
            Don't call names !                            He insults Derek.","[10, 11]"
"2.4 Stress   In polysyllabic words, a syllable can be more prominent than its surrounding syllables,
especially if it has high tone or a relatively longer duration. Yet there is no evidence that
lexical stress in Mpur is phonologically significant. In a pilot experiment conducted in the
field, I observed that no regular pattern of realised prominence of syllables exists. In
different contexts one and the same word may even show shifting prominence without
expressing a contrast.",[7]

"4.8 Reciprocal suffix -em  Reciprocal actions are expressed by means of -em 'each other' suffixed on the verb, as in
wot-em 'to see each other' from -em 'to love each other' (lit. to think each other), job-em 'to
                             ,make love (to each other)' , sapat-em 'to force each other', meni-em 'to hear each other',
unot-em 'to understand each other', as in:
     (45)     A -mim      jan      bapu    Asit    do-tem                 wom-em.

              He arrived at the house in Asiti where the two mouths of the rivers come
              together.
     The reciprocal suffix -em 'each other' also occurs as prepositional object. For example:
     (46)     De-bwar na-em.
              3PL-say to-RECIP
              They say to each other.",[14]
"1 3.3 Indefinite quantifiers   Indefinite quantifiers likeJon 'many', kerenon 'few, little' masek 'all ' , jari 'more' behave
like adjectives or adverbs (see ยง5 and ยง1 1 .5). For example:
   (223)    Man     maw        in-suma       kumpan Jon.
            month finished l SG-receive money           much

            This papaya is riper than that papaya.
   Note that the final syllables of Jarf 'able' (see ยง 1 1 .5) and Jari 'more' have high and mid
tone, respectively.",[39]
"4.6 Verbal complements
   There are a few verbs which require a verbal complement. For example the modal verbs
bwana 'to want, to need' (bwa + na 'to say + to'), mom 'to want not ', si 'to be able', as in:
   (35)     Do-bwana do-bep                    nton.
            3DU-want 3Du-carry.in.cloth child
            They want to carry the child.
   (36)     Im-bwana n-fa           manik.
            l SG-need l SG-buy mineral.oil
            I need to buy mineral oil.
   (37)     A-mom           a-sasyar         jan.
            3SM-want.not 3SM-go.outside not
            He doesn't want to come outside.
   (38)     Derek-a       a-si           a-unot        a-minsa-bar.
            Derek-3SM 3SM-is.able 3SM-knows            3SM-hunt-thing
            Derek is very good at hunting.
   Other verbs, such as bwar 'say' and from 'think' may have a verbal complement, but they
do not require it like the modal verbs.",[13]
"8.1 Question marker -e
   Question marker -e is an utterance-final clitic occurring in yes/no questions. For example:
   ( 1 04)   An-bwana an-kon-e?
             2SG-want 2sG-sleep-Q
             Do you want to sleep?

68      Cecilia Ode8.2 Question words   Content questions occur with specific question words some of which have the question
marker -e. Question words usually occur in the same syntactic position as the element they
are questioning would occur in. There is no utterance-final question marker -e in content
questions. Question words are given in ( 1 0 8 ) together with their assumed morphological
make-up:     ( 1 08)    baban, bane0)         what, which         bar-ban        thing-what

Note that the difference between nde and nte is dialectal, the former being common in
A mberbaken, the latter in Kebar. Question word baban is often pronounced as [ba13an] or
[bawan]. Gender is expressed in the question word 'who' : ma for masculine, man for
feminine (see examples ( 1 1 2) and ( 1 1 3)).
   The question words listed in ( 1 08) are illustrated in some examples:
     ( 1 09)    An-kiti    ir-o-bar          na baban?
                2SG-cut rope-v-thing for what

"
1 1.4 Adverbs of manner  Adverbs of manner can refer to how the event expressed by the verb actually takes place.
Such modifying aspectual adverbs also occur in clause-final position. For instance:

               2SG-enter just
               Come on in.

   It is beyond the scope of this article to give rules for morphophonemics. But for a better
understanding of the examples and text discussed here a few morphophonemic processes are
presented.
   Voiced stop Id/ is only pronounced as [d] in word-initial position and after nasal In/,
otherwise it is pronounced as a voiced alveolar flap [r]. In final position, voiceless stops are
often not released or released with a delay of up to some hundreds of milliseconds.
   Nasal In! is pronounced as [IJ ] before velar IkJ which is then voiced and pronounced as [g):
Imankal [maIJ ga]. Before bilabials morpheme final nasal In! is pronounced as [m] (see also
ยง3. 1 ), and before morpheme initial nasal In/ it is omitted. Note that nasals in M pur can be
syllabic in word-initial and in word-final position: the word nton 'yesterday' has three
syllables, two of which are syllabic nasals.
   On morpheme boundaries, the approximants Iwl and Iyl can be inserted between vowels.
   Consonant elision on morpheme boundaries is a very frequent phenomenon in Mpur.","[4, 5]"
"4.10 Expression of imperative
   Verbs are not inflected for the marking of Tense-Mood-Aspect. The imperative is
expressed by a verb inflected for the second person and can be strengthened by the clauseยญ
final demonstrative ka: an-det ka 'you-eat that' 'you must eat'. The prohibitive is expressed
by jan 'not' or by jan pa 'not anymore' (lit. not already). For example:
   (49)     Am-bop       sansun ka.
            2SG-wash clothes that
            You must wash clothes.
   (50)     Anoka!
            an-wot-ka
            2SG-see-that
            Look out!
   (5 1 )   An-un      jan pal
            2SG-go not      already
            Don't go !",[15]

4.9 Quote marker bwa   In running speech the verb bwar 'to say' can be used as quote marker. Final -r is often
omitted, final -a can be (sometimes extremely) lengthened, and the verb keeps its subject
prefixation. Examples are:
                                                                        A sketch of Mpur   59   (47)      Kaman      bwar     na Sasua bwa ...
