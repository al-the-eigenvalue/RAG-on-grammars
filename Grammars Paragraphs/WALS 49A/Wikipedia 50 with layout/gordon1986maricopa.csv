"         In the third person, once a referent has been established throughcontext, independent pronouns (demonstrative, this time) are not obliga­tory.    In the third person, in fact, pronouns are somewhat less obliga­tory since in oblique case roles the third person can be expressed bycliticizing the case marker to the verb (only one case marker per verb)and the omission of any pronoun or noun phrase implied a third personreference inferrable from context (discourse or physical context).",[72]

         The personal pronouns do not have forms marked with the case suf­fixes -ii or -ly.      -ii and -ly are not used on animate nouns or personalpronouns.     Animate noun phrases are not used as locations or directions.,[70]

1.23     Case Marking,    The grammatical role filled by a noun phrase with­in a predication is signalled by the case suffix at the end of the nounphrase.     The use of these case markers differs when the noun phrase ispronominal or ends in a demonstrative stem from when they are simplyaffixed to a noun.       This introduction is devoted to the use of thesecase markers on simple nouns, not pronouns, not independent demonstra­tives , not clauses (filling nominal roles).        The pronouns are discussedin sections 1.282 and 1 .29-         The noun case markers found in Maricopa are:  -sh       = subject, predicate noun  0         = object (direct and indirect), possessor, subject          of
              predicate nominal and nominalized clauses  -m        = comitative, instrumental, 'about, on the topicof1, 'by
              way of' directional  -li       = locative (at) and illative (to/toward)
                                       35
  -ly      =    locative (in/on) and illative (into/to)  -k       =    general locative and directional
1.231      -sh is suffixed to the syntactic subject of the clause, whetherthe verb is transitive or intransitive.(ll+9)    sny'ak-sh ashvar-k                 'The/a woman sang'

         man-      dem-sj 3/2-see-asp         Subject marking is not used on the syntactic/semantic subjects ofrelative clauses or nominalized clauses.            The subjects of these sub­ordinate clauses are unmarked.(151)     'iipaa :k-       raw-sh hot- k         'The man who is running is good'

These constructions are detailed in h.3 and ^.33*         Except in certain clearly defineable constructions (as in (151)and (152) above, and in section l.k) the semantic/syntactic subject iscase marked, regardless of whether it is human or non-human, animate orinanimate, definite or indefinite, old or new information, generic orspecific, volitional or non-volitional.(153)    mat-     v-     sh 'or'or-m              'The world is round'

The historical explanation offered for the predicate nominalstructure in Yuman by Munro (1977) accounts quite nicely for this con­struction in Maricopa.      This explanation accounts for the otherwiseanomalous case marking distribution by postulating an underlying struc­ture for predicate nominal sentences in which           the   two nouns‘forma sub­ject clause subordinate to themain verb 'be' which is used existential-ly, rather than copularly.","[52, 53, 54]"

1.223     The possessor can be explicitly expressed in an independentnoun.     The noun which expresses the possessor has no case suffix andimmediately precedes the possessed noun.         Thus, a possessive construc­tion can consist of two or more nouns (or an independent pronoun and anoun (or nouns)), with only the last noun case marked (for the role ofthe NF in its clause).","[46, 47]"

A more elaborate noun phrase can consist of a noun possessed byanother noun (with appropriate marking), or modified by an attributiveadjective or a demonstrative adjective (or all of these).

         It is possible to distinguish between a reflexive and a reci­
procal reading in a sentence like (270). mat- ku-shiint-sh (ref- rel-
one+pl-sj) can be put in as the final element of the subject HP or in
place of the subject NP; if this element occurs in the sentence only a
reciprocal reading is possible. This portion of a relative clause can
occur after a plural noun or in place of a noun. It cannot appear after
noun phrases conjoined by uudav 'accompany'.

5.3 Simplification and Reduction.     In this section I present a number ofconstructions whose historical development illustrates simplificationof the grammatical structure and phonological reduction of the elements
                                    281
of the construction.     The kind of simplicity I am referring to is basi­cally waht Langacker (1977) called ""signal simplicity"" and ""construe- -tional simplicity"".     By ""signal simplicity"" he meant (Langacker, 1977:102-103) ""economy in regard to production of the speech signal,,.Other syn-
                                   *
tactic aspects of signal simplicity pertain to reduction in status ofunits   from relative independence to relative dependence.""    ""Construe-cionai simplicity"" is ""reflected syntactically from marked categories tobe replaced by relatively unmarked ones; for marked constructions togive way to more commonplace ones; and for the intrinsic complexity ofconstructions to be reduced"" (Langacker, 1977:107).     Obviously, phonolo­gical reduction typically accompanies a change in the direction of ""sig­nal simplicity"".    These two kinds of simplicity   are, together withtransparency and perceptual optimality, the interacting pressures onlanguages in directing change (Langacker, 1977).     In the cases I am pre­senting each move toward simplicity (.toward making the individual sen­tences simpler), results in a more complex system in the sense that froma fund of extablished elements systematically interacting new elementsare formed which no longer participate in a straightforward way in thesystems in which the original parts of the construction played a role.
5-31 -uum.    One case of ""simplification"" involves the incompletive suf­fix -num.    There is a great dear of evidence in Maricopa that the dia­chronic source of the incompletive suffix -uum is the verb 'be' duu-m(with its m ’suffix).   This has been suggested for other River languages,Crawford (1976:^5) noted ""There is substantial evidence from within Mo­jave, as well as from comparison with other Yuman languages, that /u/[in some Mojave suffixes including -urn 'has to, must', -chum 'emphatic',                                    282
 -turn 'usitative*, etc.] is a contraction or reduction of id^: be,”           An existential auxiliary becomes an affix on the verb according to the analysis proposed by Crawford (1976).       Langdon (l97Pa). presented a number of examples from several Yuman languages of reduced forms of a 'be' auxiliary.    In Upland Pai (Havsupai, Hualapai, and Yavapai) reduced forms of 'be* play an important role in the verbal system.","[298, 299, 300]"
"         Possessor noun phrases precede the possessed noun.          Attributiveand demonstrative adjectives follow the noun they modify.             Demonstra­tive adjectives follow attributive adjectives.            The demonstrative suf­fix precedes the ease marking suffix; a noun can only be marked with ademonstrative suffix or modified by a demonstrative adjective, but notboth.     The order of elements in the noun phrase can be schematized as:                                Attributive      Demonstrative
     Possessor NP - Nstem -                                      - Case Suffix

or     Pronoun stem - case suffix
1.21     Number on nouns.      Noun roots like verb roots are unmarked fornumber.    Unlike verb roots, however, most nouns do not have alternateforms reflecting plurality.          Those nouns which have specifically pluralforms do not have distinct dual forms.            Like verbs, those nouns whichdo have overtly plural forms are often used in their unmarked forms inplural contexts.      (The marking of plurality is never obligatory.)

Thus,the first noun is unmarked as the subject of a subordinate clause andthe second noun is unmarked just because it is the last element of asubject clause and therefore, the bearer of the morphology which marksthe role of the clause.","[54, 55]"

the individual sentences had reduced hierarchical structure, However,the result of all this 'simplification' is c considerably more complexsystem.","[321, 322, 323, 324]"
"This is obviously not the ordinary realis marking -k suffix however,since it can be used on verb forms which are not otherwise marked withthe -k^ suffix to mark realis (,i*e. -m verbs),        Munro (to appear) has proposed that this -k is a case markerused to mark the ""topic of conversation"" which has been extended tomarking full quotation clauses,   (in synchronic Maricopa the ""topic ofconversation"" NP is typically marked with -m,      In Maricopa, however, -mappears to be a very general case marker which could easily absorbfunctions from other cases.)   This seems to be the most likely explana­tion for this distribution of -k on these complement clauses.      Thisconstruction is not unique to Maricopa; it is found in the other Riverlanguages and in the Pai languages (at least).      The occurrence of thisconstruction in both River and Pai languages demonstrates that thisconstruction may be reconstructable to an earlier stage in which -It isthe usual case marker for ""topic of conversation"" NPs.",[138]

        Ablaut of the root vowel is used in Maricopa (and the other .
River languages) in deriving plural forms (of both nouns and verbs),
nominalized forms of verbs and causative verbs, Halpern (1956) devotes
some space, to showing the different ablaut patterns in Yuma.
       Langdon (1976a) presented a set of rules to account for the
ablaut pattern found in Yuma. Yuma like the other River languages and
the Pai languages has a five vowel system which Langdon (1976a) de­
termined is derived from an original three vowel system. The qualita­
tive ablaut found in Yuma is (following Langdon (1976a).. the result of a
quantitative ablaut system and combinations of the stem vowel with fol­
lowing     suffixes participating in certain sound changes.
     ™ In Maricopa, quantitative and qualitative and both quantitative
and qualitative ablaut patterns are found. A list of the vocalic ablaut
which I have seen (or rather heard) in Maricopa follows.
                        Ablaut of the Root Vowel          i         >   i:                         >    i

         This affix is found as a number marker on both nouns and verbs.
t_- is affixed after n (as in (98)), t and sh (as exemplified in verbs
       (ii)   ttuupuum-k      'burn v.t. plural' from tpom-m 'burn'
      (iii)   mshtraash-k 'be angry dual'         from mshray-m 'be angry'
but not after £ (as exemplified in (100)).       t^ is also found before s_ as
in
       (iv)   ts'osh   'babies'    from s'aw    'baby'
ch- as noted later in the text is found after ny-. sh- is found else­
where. Before sh- it is difficult to determine whether the affix is sh-
or t_-, since there is a phonological rule which turns sh into t_ before
sh.
        It is difficult to determine exactly where this affix should be
placed. Typically, as noted it is found before the first consonant pre­
ceding the root vowel, but this is not always the case. Langdon (1970:
110) in discussing the distribution of the cognate affix in Diegueno
noted ""In multiple prefix stems where a non-initial prefix stem is a
palatal, c_ is infixed into the non-plural stem directly after the
palatal prefix, in all other cases it is infixed after the first prefix
of the non-plural stem."" This is the typical position in Maricopa,
though as in Diegueno, there are exceptions and reanalyses.
       7
        None of the body parts to which I have seen ny- affixed are
vowel initial (thus, none of them begin with the body part prefix ii_).
Typically, ny is prefixed to body parts which have first person pos­
sessors and it is not affixed with other possessors (though it can be).
       g
        ny-wish looks like a nominalized verb (wii-m 'to do, have')
prefixed with ny.
       (iv) va      '-wii-m           'I have a house'
              house 1-do- asp
       ny-wish can be marked with aspect suffixes and itself be used as
a main verb.
       (v)    va    '-ny- wish-       k        'I have a house1
              house 1-poss-have+nom-asp
        This is in keeping with the argument which follows (in section
1 .227) proposing that ny is used to derived verbs from nouns (thus, ny
verbalizes the nominalized verb wish or uuwish) (cf. Langdon (197 8a)).
       9
        This prefix is probably not productive in this verbalizing use
in Maricopa; however, there is evidence that it was used this way.
Consider the following examples.
       (vii) nyaa-sh mat       dany '-ny-   mat- k        'I own this land'
               I-   sj earth this 1-poss-land-asp
                                      71
       (viii)     hat vtay *-ny-         hat-k       'I have a big dog1
                  dog big    1-poss-dog-asp
       Neither mat nor hat can themselves serve as verbs— only with
can these be verbs, and transitive verbs at that,
       10
         In Munro and Gordon (to appear) it Is noted ""In many languages
the number of clauses which might he needed to translate an NP-heavy
English clause is a much greater one, and the corresponding density of
NPs per clause is invariably lower than the English maximum."" The high­
est number of arguments I have seen in any Maricopa clause is 5: &
verb which normally takes a subject, object and indirect object can oc­
cur with an added locative and instrumental, for example.
       (ix)     va-     s-   ly Pam-sh iishaaly-m         uunyor Allen
                house-dem-in Pam-sj hand-          asc book      Allen                 aay- m            'Pam gave Allen the book with her hand*
                 give-asp
Typically, however the number of nouns per verb is much lower than this.","[86, 87, 88, 89]"
"         In possessive constructions, the possessor nouns are always un­marked for case.(165)     'iipaa-ny-a    ny- va-       ny- sh vtay-m   'That man's house is big'
          man-dem-Vaug poss-house-dem-sj big-asp         As indicated above (section 1.231), the first (or subject) nounphrase in a predicate nominal sentence is typically unmarked.(166)    mhay-ny-a         ’-schaa.-        sh suu-m   'The boy is my younger

          l-older=bro Indian-   sj be+du-asp         This assignment of case marking (as well as usual occurrence ofzero pronominalization [see section 1 .292]) can result in ambiguity inthe reading of the relationship between the unmarked noun and the sub­ject marked noun in a predicate nominal sentence.(168)    snych'aak-ny-a    naw-   sh uuduush-k (a) 'They are those

                                                            friends'
The relationship between the unmarked and the case marked noun in (l68)is interpretable as possessor-possessed (as in a) or as predicatenominal subject-predicate noun (as in b).","[56, 57]"

          I assume for expository purposes that if the language has only
one form for both dual and plural stems, that stem is plural. In the
cases in which the dual column is blank, it is because the plural stem
is used.",[169]
"         The question in Maricopa is marked by rising intonation and by thestructure of the verb.         The range of verbal structures is discussed insection 5-33.     One simple way to inflect the verb of a present-pastquestion is to omit the final realis suffix {.if the verb does not have asecond person subject).         If the verb Is consonant final, ii is suffixedto it.     If the verb is vowel final, the final vowel is lengthened.

        Heather-sj neg- see-neg-yet- asp        Some verbs have alternate stems which are used with a number ofnon-final suffixes of which -ma 'negative' is one.

Allthe verbs which have alternate forms occurring in the negative havevowel final stems and the alternation involves a change in that vowel,In the case of 'be' the change if from uu to 0^; (as in this case) whenthe alternation occurs, the alternate forms have shorter (and with someverbs lower) vowels,        When both aly- and a case marker (see section 1.26) are cliti-cized to the verb, the order is negative clitic before case clitic.",[82]

"Two cases which are alw^s expressed by case marking on the noun phraseand agreement on the verb are subject and object (cf, section 1.23),        A verb is typically subcategorized for certain arguments— asubject (intransitive verbs), a subject and object (transitive verbs),a subject and two objects (ditransitive verbs), a subject and an obliqueobject (position verbs), etc.    Ho clause in Maricopa has. more than two

arguments beyond those for which it is subcategorized.       In most clauses,in fact, there are far fewer arguments,    But, the maximum number of ar­guments in any Maricopa clause is five.      This notion was touched on insection 1 .25.",[221]

"         The use of independent pronouns is not particularly emphatic orrare.     The occurrence of first or second person pronouns is,common; theuse of the demonstrative pronouns is somewhat rarer.         Personal pronounsare found in all roles, since the agreement system (section l.ll) issomewhat less than uniquely referring, this is helpful in processing;however, they are also used in contexts which are unambiguous.(2^2)     man-sh m-sper-   m            'You are strong'

"         It has heen postulated (Munro, 1976b) that there was a point inthe history of the River languages when subject clauses were subordinatedto a higher existential verb.   This is hypothesized as the source of theexicstential auxiliary construction (cf, section 3.252),   In the exis­tential auxiliary construction, stative and intransitive verbs have astheir auxiliary duu-m   'be'; active transitive verbs have wii-m 'do';and verbs of communication, verbal behavior and manifestation have 'ii-m'say',         In the construction in which a future object clause is subordi­nated to the verb shuupaw-m 'know', the existential Is obligatorily duu-m'be' and it is not marked for the subject of the lexical verb.   A sug- ~gested explanation for the construction (Margaret Langdon, p.c,) is thatthe duu-m 'be' imparts the meaning ""it was the case that,,."", thus thetranslation for (63) would literally be ""I know it is the case that youwill cry.""   The problem with this suggestion is that it does not explainwhy this unmarked form of 'be' should be restricted to occurring withclausal objects which refer to the future; why should(61i)*man-sh m-mii-m duu-m  shuupaw-m        *1 know it it the case that

^,33 Perfective-Marked Clauses.     There is another way to modify an HPwith a clause without nominalizing that clause.          As in the switch refe­rence case described above, the non-norainalized cluases described hereare marked with verbal rather than nominal morphology and their subjects(when they occur within the clause) are subject marked.          This kind ofreferring clauses employs the emphatic perfective suffixes -ksha and-sha tcf, section 2,215),     These clauses can only have past reference(like the switch reference marked clauses, but unlike nominalizedclauses).

In (28l), the secondperson pronoun is in the subject case, it triggers verb agreement andthe word of ii'e 'hair' is unmarked for case.        The semantic relationshipsbetween the elements of the clause remain the same— 'you' have 'hair'and 'the hair' is 'black'.

"The noticeable diachronic change which has occurred between present-day                                272
Mojave and earlier stages of Mojave is not the change from the structurein figure 1 to that in figure 2 in a straight line of development.      Thechange is more likely from a stage which ""both structures existed as inmodern Maricopa.     The change consists of the loss of the constructionin which the quantified event is expressed as the syntactic subject ofthe quantifier verb,     This is in keeping with a trend toward eliminatingnon-personal subjects in Mojave.     In Mojave, far more than in Maricopa,there is a powerful tendency away from clausal subjects,i?.2   Multiple Analyses.   Hankamer (.1977) proposed that some synchronicconstructions can only be correctly described by saying they have morethan one analysis.     This multiple analysis can be of two kinds,   ""Con­junctive multiple analysis"" is what produces a construction in whichboth analyses must be appropriate for each instance of the construction(i.e., the ungrammatical forms are produced withen either analysis wouldnot produce the output; the grammatical forms are only those which bothanalyses would predict).     ""Disjunctive multiple analysis""   occurs wheneither of the analyses produces a grammatical form (thus, the grammaticalforms are what both analyses would predict and what each of the analyseswould predict independently).     In both cases, the features of the con­struction cannot be account for in one analysis and the analyses must""partially overlap in the classes of sentences derived"" (Hankamer, 1977:590)         The constructions to be presented in this section are all fixedforms of the shape V V,     The relationship between the elements of theseconstructions vary between subordinate and main verb; main and auxiliaryverb; and verb and suffix.    Each of these can be seen as a case of

"In this case, identity of form is obligatory.             Both verbs will be inthird person subject form.       The usual way to pronominalize third personsubject is by deletion.      Thus, the switch reference system provides themethod for disambiguating sentences which have clauses with deletedthird person subjects.       The other uses of the switch reference systemare redundant since verb agreement will usually suffice to tell whether
                                         108
or not the two verbs have the same (or different) subjects.

"         This shows again that the switch reference system is sensitiveto the syntactic, rather than the semantic, roles of the WPs,     Moreover,it demonstrates that variation in the choice of 'same subject’ 'and'different subject' may well reflect that the two sentences (reflectingthe variants) may have a different syntactic organization,         The presentation of the switch reference system up to this pointhas discussed only regular cases.     There is a (large) number of verbs inMaricopa which    do not participate in the switchreference system.   Theseare the verbs which are discussed in section 2,211 under the label -averbs,   All verbs which take -m as their simple realis aspect markercannot be marked with -k in the meaning 'same subject'.    These verbs(when in a construction where the switch reference system plays a role)are always marked with -m:         (.151)   Bonnie-sh 'ayu nya- maa-m onyor   'Bonnie^ reads while
