"Chapter 6, which is concerned with pronouns, is an appropriate transition between
chapter 5 on nouns and chapter 7, which is concerned with verbs. While, prototypically,
pronouns take the place of nominal referents, they also play an important role in the
verbal system, where they bear TAM (tense, aspect and mode) distinctions. The larger
part of the chapter is concerned with the basic categories of personal pronouns
distinguished in Mambay: subject, object and possessive pronouns. Each of these
pronoun types also has emphatic forms produced by various strategies. A final section
deals with interrogative pronouns.",[44]
"7.4.2.3 Subjunctive constructions with pá ‘make, do’
Finally, Optative verb forms are found in subjunctive constructions which pattern as the
object of pá ‘make, do’ (7.6.3). In this case, a periphrastic causitive construction results:                                            356

Five of the six basic inflectional categories (7.4) have corresponding negative forms
(7.5.1). The segmental and tonal form of a verb word remains constant when it is
negated. Verbal negation is instead marked by negative particles (7.5.2), and with
Indicative verb forms, by negative subject pronouns (7.5.3). A summary of negative
verbal forms is provided in 7.5.4.","[373, 374]"
"7.4.1.1.1.3 Pluperfect
The Pluperfect tense is used for previously completed events with consequences for a
point in time subsequent to the event but prior to the point of reference in a discourse.
The Pluperfect is found with intransitive verbs as well as transitive verbs that take
reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2). It is typically structured as follows:       subject pronoun +           verb
       Indicative pronoun (CV) stem (Pluperfect tone) + reflexive suffix   ex. mì Qáá4ní            I had moved away
       1SG move.away:PLUPERF-1SG.REFL       rò Qáá4ró            you (pl.) had moved away
       2PL move.away:PLUPERF-2PL.REFL   cf. corresponding Perfect forms:       mì Qáà4ní            I have moved away

singular and plural forms (excluding co-referential forms) of the Perfect are marked with
a zero pronoun.",[362]
"Represented by a single tense, the Imperfective is typically expressed simply by using a
Realis subject pronoun (6.1.2) with a verbal noun (5.9). As is explained in the section on
verbal nouns, a comparable situation is found in the well-known case of Hausa
(Dimmendaal 2000:171, Newman 2000:288–92) and in Kebi-Benue languages such as
Mundang (Elders 2000:327–30).",[363]

As is often the case in verbal paradigms (Dimmendaal 2000:175, Cysouw 2003:61), the
third person is marked with a zero pronoun with Perfective tenses in Mambay. This is the
only pronoun category which is always unmarked, and it is significant because third
person Perfective forms are by far the most commonly used pronouns in discourse (in
particular, narrative discourse) in Mambay (Anonby 2005:29–32).       Ø     hèè                                  he/she/it climbed

pronouns, which are only dropped when a nominal subject is used.","[286, 287]"
"10.1.3 Verbless clauses
Verbless clauses (chains) are common in Mambay. Except in the case of interrogative
pronouns, they must contain another element in addition to a noun or noun phrase (6.2,
                                           436
10.1.2.2). Verbless clauses are constructed by combining a subject noun phrase
(minimally consisting of a noun or pronoun) with one of the following elements:       - particle (10.1.3.1);
       - noun (phrase) (0);
       - adjective (10.1.3.3);
       - numeral (10.1.3.4); or
       - prepositional phrase (10.1.3.5).","[453, 454]"

"Instances of formal redundancy between some of the slots are summarized in 6.1.1.5. In
particular, the third person generic (omitted in the main chart on the previous page; see
6.1.1.3) and third person impersonal slots are marginal, since in most cases they share the
form of other third person pronouns. Taking this into account, the basic pronoun system
of Mambay may be schematized as follows:                          The basic pronoun system of Mambay                                     1SG          1PL                                     2SG          2PL                                   1&2SG         1&2PL

6.1.1.1 First-and-second (1&2)
First-and-second (1&2) person pronouns are “inclusive,” that is, they involve (at least) a
speaker and an addressee. Mambay stands apart from most closely related languages and
other languages in the region not in that it has inclusive pronouns, but in that this slot is
distinguished for “singular” and plural (Duru / Yag Dii in north-central Cameroon also
exhibits this system; see Bohnhoff 1986:104). 1&2 singular pronouns refer to the
minimal communication dyad, namely, a speaker and an addressee.       nà                sáà    mâh     we (you (sg.) and I) are in the granary
       1&2SG.INDEP       inside granary       kpáhlì      )áná                   our (your (sg.) and my) stool
       stool:LF    1&2SG.POSSFrom a numeric point of view, these pronouns are dual rather than singular. However, in
the pronominal system, they pattern as singular by virtue of a grammaticalized opposition
to the 1&2 plural pronouns (cf. Thomas 1955:207–8, Corbett 2000:166–9, Cysouw
2003:85–90, 260–4 and 2005:5). 1&2 plural pronouns refer to a communication dyad
with a speaker, an addressee, and at least one other participant. The “other(s)” may be
aligned with either the speaker or the addressee.       nànzà             sáà    mâh     we (you and we / you (pl.) and I) are in the granary

       stool:LF    1&2PL.POSSIn the above examples, it is evident that the form of the 1&2 singular is similar to that of
the plural (this is also the case in Duru; see Bohnhoff 1986:104, 129 footnote 3). In fact,
for verbal subject pronouns, 1&2 singular and plural forms are identical; the singular vs.
plural distinction is instead formalized on verbs through the use of the verbal plurality
affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) and singular vs. plural reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) on verb stems.       nà      hèè                        we (you (sg.) and I) climbed

In all cases where there is a formal singular vs. plural distinction, the plural counterpart
contains a morpheme with the consonant z. This underlines the 1&2 plural’s formal
alignment with other explicit plural marking in the language, which is also typically
found with z (5.5, 5.9.2.1, 7.3.1.1).","[274, 275, 276]"

6.1.5.1 Emphatic subject pronouns
For most of the personal pronouns, any type of emphatic subject pronoun may be
produced by placing an independent pronoun (6.1.2.1) before a subject pronoun of the
same person.       mì mì sáà      mâh                  I am in the granary

       3PL.COREF:IRR climb:FUT-PLHowever, for the third person singular (6.1.5.1.1), first-and-second person plural
(6.1.5.1.2) and third person plural (6.1.5.1.3), the emphatic pronoun template is more
complex than this. In all of these cases, the attested strategies include lengthening of
independent pronouns and the presence of a word-final L tone (compare emphatic
negative objects in 10.1.2.3). This is possible for these three pronouns only because they
are segmentally distinct from verbal subject pronouns, where length and tone are already
used to mark TAM distinctions (6.1.2.4–6.1.2.6).","[305, 306]"
"6.1.4 Possessive pronouns
Mambay has two sets of possessive pronouns: alienable (6.1.4.1) and inalienable
(6.1.4.2). While alienable possessive pronouns are the default set and may be used with
any noun, inalienable possessive pronouns may only be used with a small subgroup of
nouns representing certain body parts as well as terms of kinship and social relation
(5.3.4.1). The two sets are as follows:

heavy syllable or two light syllables and thus meet the minimal weight requirement
characteristic of nouns (5.1.1.1). This is not the case for inalienable possessive pronouns,
which in most cases are comprised of a single light syllable.","[295, 296]"
"5.9.1    True verbal nouns
True verbal nouns (henceforth referred to simply as verbal nouns) exhibit characteristics
of nouns as well as verbs (Chapter 7). They are semantically predictable in that they
minimally refer to a verbal action or state which is brought about by the subject (whether
agent or another role) (cf. fossilized verbal nouns; see 5.9.2).        verbal noun                                 verb stem

heavy syllable or two light syllables; this contrasts with verbs, since in the data there are
fifteen examples of verb roots comprised of a light syllable. In fact, a compensatory g is
inserted for verbal nouns derived from verb roots comprised of a light syllable (2.4.3,
7.1.1):       verbal noun                                 verb stem

verbal nouns correspond to finite verb roots, with which they are found in derivational
relationship. While complexities of derivation are discussed in the sections devoted to
each type of verbal noun (5.9.1.1 and 5.9.1.2), some general observations underline the
verb-like behaviour of verbal nouns. Importantly, verbal nouns are used in the Mambay
verbal system, where with subject pronouns they express the verbal function of the
Imperfective (7.4.1.1.2). A comparable situation is found in the well-known case of
Hausa (Dimmendaal 2000:171, Newman 2000:288–92) and in Kebi-Benue languages
such as Mundang (Elders 2000:327–30).       verbal noun                                 Imperfective verb form

accompaniment by adverbs (8.1).","[242, 243]"
"9.1.1 Syntactic distribution of numerals
Numerals often modify nouns, whether as a dependent element in a noun phrase or as a
predicate of a verbless clause (9.1.1.1). There are also cases in the data where they
appear to function adverbially (9.1.1.2). Finally, they are used for mathematical
operations even when there is no syntactic head in view (9.1.1.3).",[427]
"The syntactic distribution of TAM adverbs is heterogeneous: they are found before
subject pronouns, after verb words, in both of these positions and, in one case (%âh ‘go
ahead…’), between the subject pronoun and verb word. However, consistent TAM
functions are associated with each position.",[381]
"9.3.1 Prepositional phrase structure
Prepositions head prepositional phrases, where they are located at the phrases’ left edge
(in this regard, prepositional phrases resemble noun phrases, which are also left-headed;
see 5.14). A preposition is always followed by a noun or a noun-phrase complement.       bèè     túrà                   without millet

"5.2.2.1 Tone melody
Tonally, the melody of the linked form is often the same as that of the free form, although

This is the case for linked forms corresponding to nouns whose free forms are associated
with H, L and HL tone melodies. (As noted in the previous paragraph, the pronoun )íí
‘my (al.)’ has been used throughout to provide a natural context for example linked
forms).",[189]

In a verbal clause with two objects, one object is typically a patient and the other a
recipient. Two strategies are available in such situations, and in both cases, the more
salient object in the discourse follows the other object. If the more salient object is a
patient, it simply follows the recipient:       Ø     híí           mí      sò lá            he/she/it gave me an axe

"Three of the underived numerals ( àtì ‘two,’ tàrnágà ‘seven’ and fwàrnágà ‘eight’)
exhibit contracted forms reminiscent of nouns subjected to a linked noun template

has no grammatical significance. Rather, it is a predictable phenomenon which applies in
non phrase-final position. In each case, the final vowel is dropped and the tone melody
remains stable. Example alternations are as follows:       kágà     àt náá                          these two chickens

"5.14.1 Noun + noun
Noun + noun phrases, described here as possessive constructions, are the most common
type of noun phrase in Mambay (5.3). They are composed of a possessed head noun
followed by a dependent possessor. While the possessed noun exhibits a linked form
(5.2.1), the possessor’s form is free (i.e., unmarked).       hûg     kágà                             chicken bone

Noun + adjective phrases are formed in the same way as possessive constructions (5.3,
5.14.1): while the head noun exhibits a linked form (5.2), the dependent adjective is
unmarked.        îg        gbéndén                       short child

5.14.3 Noun + numeral
There are two types of noun + numeral phrases; these differ only in the form of the first

Because pronouns play a major role in verbal inflection (cf. 7.4), the description of
pronouns in Mambay provides a suitable transition between the description of nouns
(Chapter 5) and that of verbs (Chapter 7). Most of the present chapter is devoted to the
cataloguing and description of personal pronouns (6.1), and a final section (6.2) presents
interrogative pronouns.","[270, 271, 272]"
"5.1.2.3.1 Noun-to-noun derivation
Prefixes are used to derive nouns from other nouns. In the case of the prefixes fí4, kì4
and tí4 (when used as an augmentative; see 5.8.2), this derivational mechanism is
synchronically productive (see examples of each prefix in 5.1.2.4).       fí4gòòrá        kitchen (i.e. room of preparation)      cf. gòòrá     preparation

As is the case in many African languages (Dimmendaal 2000:170), participant nouns in
Mambay are typically found as possessed head nouns in the context of possessive
constructions. This is true of all three types (male/generic, female and non-human). An
additional and equivalent female participant noun construction in Mambay involves the
addition of a prefix to a noun. Possessor nouns which follow the possessed noun or
prefix are commonly, but not exclusively, verbal nouns (cf. 5.9.1). Participant nouns
may have either an agentive or a patientive role in relation to verbal nouns.","[234, 235]"
"There are no syntactic indicators which separate ideophonic nouns from other nouns, nor
are there any precise morphological criteria whereby they can be distinguished.
However, there is a strong correlation between non-canonical noun structure (5.1.1.1) and
ideophonic function (as described in 8.2). For example, species names and unusual items
whose phonological forms reflect perceptual realities are well-represented (and perhaps
even normative) among non-canonical nouns (examples are given in 5.11.1). In
particular, this is the case for noun stems which exhibit reduplication (5.11.2). In
addition to nouns which are inherently ideophonic, ideophonic nouns derived from
adjectives also exist (5.11.3).",[261]
"Indicative verb forms are specified for Realis and Irrealis values. In contrast to Optative
forms, which are inherently irrealis and not marked for realis distinction, Indicative
Realis (7.4.1.1) and Irrealis (7.4.1.2) forms are distinguished. Formally, this distinction is
marked on the subject pronoun: Realis pronouns are short (CV), and Irrealis pronouns are
long (CVV) (6.1.2). While Realis forms signal events which have happened or are
happening, Irrealis forms signal events that have not already happened and which are not8
  In the present study, as has been common in the study of Niger-Congo generally, the term “tense” is
understood in a traditional sense: “any one of the different forms or modifications (or word-groups) in the
conjugation of a verb which indicate the different times (past, present, or future) at which the action or
state denoted by it is viewed as happening or existing, and also (by extension) the different nature of such
action or state, as continuing (imperfect) or completed (perfect)” (Oxford English Dictionary online 2007;
cf. Doke 1935:209, Dimmendaal 2000:162 and Crystal 2003:459–60). This differs from the use of the term
in Comrie (1976) and, subsequently, much of the literature (e.g. Lyons 1995:312 ff.), where event sequence
(“tense”) and the internal structure of events (“aspect”) are treated as distinct categories of verb
modification. In Mambay, there is no formal justification for such a distinction.",[356]
"6.1 Personal pronouns
In Mambay, thirteen pronoun slots are grammaticalized based on person, number and
related values (6.1.1). Pronouns are used to mark subjects (6.1.2), objects (6.1.3) and
possessors (6.1.4). Each category of personal pronoun is found with a corresponding set
of emphatic pronouns (6.1.5).",[272]

verbal noun has two light syllables and the vowel of the first syllable is an exact echo of
the second syllable’s vowel (i.e., V1=V2), the second vowel is deleted when 4zí is added.       mì vágà                    I go / I am going
       1SG go:VN       nà vâg4zí                  we (incl.) go / we (incl.) are going
       1&2 go:VN-PLOtherwise, the second syllable is maintained, and 4zí precedes it.       mì héérà                   I climb / I am climbing
       1SG climb:VN       nà héé4zí4rà               we (incl.) climb / we (incl.) are climbing (cf. héérà ‘climbing’)

                                            347
The affixation of 4zí to some disyllabic nouns is accompanied by irregular morphological
alternations—even suppletion. For example, the final syllable of a two-syllable irregular
verbal noun changes to 4rV if the original suffix is 4gV. (This alternation corresponds
the domain of vestigial noun suffixes, which are otherwise opaque. Note also that
historically, the value of the final vowel has often assimilated partially to the stem; see
5.1.3.2 and Anonby 2007b:REF).   ex. mì húmgò                   I come / I am coming
       1SG come:VN       nà húm4zí4rò               we (incl.) come / we (incl.) are coming

       1&2 walk:VN-PL-VNIn the case of a verbal noun ending in 4%V, a similar process happens, but the % of the
first syllable is deleted and the short vowel in the first syllable undergoes compensatory
lengthening.       mì hú%ò                    I die / I am dying
       1SG die:VN-PL-VN       nà húúzírò                 we (incl.) die / we (incl.) are dying
       1&2 die:VN-PL-VNIf an irregular verbal noun ends with 4bV or 4vV, the final syllable’s consonant is
retained and the vowel i is epenthesized before the plural affix 4zí. Additionally, a

unpredictable, because it is the same as that of the irregular verbal noun used in an
Imperfective function (5.9.1.2). Most commonly, it is HL (for Imperfective forms
corresponding to intransitive stems in any tone class; see 5.9.1.2). For transitive verbs,
the tone melody of the verbal noun is uniform within a given tonal class (5.9.1.1).
Examples of Imperfective forms from each of the six tonal classes (separated here for
transitivity) are as follows:

Imperfective, which are marked with a HL pronoun, are discussed in 7.5.","[363, 364, 365, 366, 367]"
"In cases where both short and long forms are found (cf. 9.1), short forms rather than long
forms are used for mathematical operations.       eight (short form)      fwàrnágà (Chadian dialect: fwàrnâh)

       ten (short form)        zó%ôm
             (long form)       séhná kíríbNote that there appears to be a shift away from the use of the long forms by younger
speakers of the language, even for modifying nouns. For the numerals ‘eight’ and ‘nine,’
this shift is partial. However, for the numeral ‘ten,’ the shift is complete: the long form is
known only to older speakers of the language.",[429]
"In most cases, the segmental structure of an inalienable noun-pronoun possessive
construction is a simple amalgamation of the linked form (5.2.2) of the head noun and the
inalienable possessive pronoun.       fàà     +         4ró                   fààró                      your (pl.) back, skin

Still, many segmental alternations take place at the boundary between inalienable
possessive pronouns and the head nouns to which they are attached. These alternations
are summarized in the following subsections according to the segmental context offered
by the linked forms of head nouns they accompany.","[299, 300]"

with káálà (linked form: káà) ‘head, reason’ and byàá (linked form: bèè) ‘water.’
Some of these names include:       káà4fí4fyàá   (cf. fí4 ‘place of’; fyáà ‘moon, month, festival’)

       bèè4zwâ’          (cf. zwâ’ ‘ancestry’)5.13 Locative function of nouns
As is the case for prepositions (9.3), nouns may be used to indicate location (for formal
differences between the two word classes, see 9.3.3). Like objects of transitive verbs
(7.3.2.1.2), nouns functioning locatively are morphologically unmarked complements
which follow a verb.       Ø yàà fíílò                          he/she/it stayed at the house
       3:PFV stay:PFV house   cf. Ø kó fíílò                           he/she/it saw the house
       3:PFV see:PFV house
                                            250
Importantly, and similar to what is found in Mundang and some related languages (Elders
2000:253–4, Welmers 1973:216–7; cf. Ruelland 1992:230–1), there is no formal
difference between the two following a transitive verb. This may lead to ambiguity
which is only resolved in the referential realm, as the following example shows:       Ø làà4rì túrà                        he/she/it has eaten millet / he/she/it has eaten
       3:PFV eat:PERF-PERF millet             at the millet (i.e., among the millet plants)When an object and locational complement are found in the same clause, the object
comes first.       Ø làà túrà )áà                       he/she/it has eaten millet among the bean plants
       3:PFV eat:PFV millet beans       Ø làà )áà túrà                       he/she/it has eaten beans among the millet plants
       3:PFV eat:PFV beans milletAlthough a wide range of nouns could be used in a locative function, three categories in
particular are commonly used: locations in the referential realm, inherently locative
nouns, and body parts used in a locative capacity.","[267, 268]"

This contrasts with intransitive stems, with which reflexive suffixes function
inflectionally (7.3.2.1.1). With transitive stems, the reflexive suffixes appease obligatory
object requirements, resulting in valence reduction; in other words, transitive verbs are
detransitivized. Such verbs are inflected like intransitive verbs belonging to the same
tonal class.       transitive verb construction               detransitivized verb construction       mì dú74rì                                  mì dú74ní

Perfective (7.4.1.1.1.1) or Imperfective (7.4.1.1.2) forms.        In cases where the
detransitivized basic Perfective or Imperfective meaning is intended, the transitive

"7.6.3.2.1 Auxiliaries followed by verbal nouns
Most auxiliaries are followed by verbal nouns, which express the central event or state of
a clause. This given, there are three positions in which the verbal noun accompanying an
auxiliary may be found:       1. on its own;       mì      %áá            té’là                           I was able to walk
       1SG     find:PFV       walk:VN       2. prefixed with kì4 ‘place, time, situation’ (5.1.2.4.5);       mì      )èr            kì4té’là                        I was just walking
       1SG     get.up:PFV     place:PFX-walk:VN       3. as a complement of a preposition (cf. 9.3)       mì      tìì            má      té’là                   I walk (habitually) /
       1SG     become:PFV     with    walk:VN                   I walked (habitually)As is evident from the first and second examples here, the distribution of a verbal noun
vs. a verbal noun prefixed with kì4 does not appear to be semantically significant.
However, in most cases a given auxiliary is syntactically limited to one of the two
strategies; the reasons for the choice of one form over another are not clear. Both are
found with intransitive as well as intransitive verbs, so based on transitivity requirements
established elsewhere in the language (7.3.2.1), verbal nouns (with or without kì4) must
be viewed variously as adverbial complements (with intransitive auxiliaries) or objects
(with transitive auxiliaries).",[387]
"As is the case for spontaneous possessive constructions, which are formally equivalent,
the internal formal structure of the compound is ambiguous (cf. 5.3.2). For example, if
such a referential context were possible, nàm dâg tèNn bà7gè could also be understood
to mean ‘animal of mouth/edge of side of rust-colour.’5.4.2.2 Noun + numeral compounds
Other compound nouns contain a numeral (9.1) as a dependent element.       hèègì dâg àt                circumcision knife, scissors
       knife:LF mouth:LF two       tòh dâg àt                  snake sp.

These compounds are formally equivalent to count constructions in which the head noun
is definite (5.14.3, 9.1.1.1). For example, depending on the referential context, vbîz bóm
may also be understood to mean ‘the one fishhook.’5.4.2.3 Compounds containing prepositional phrases
A few compound nouns in the data contain or are comprised of prepositional phrases
(9.3):       páà bèè káálà               stupid person
       man:LF without head       sáà dwaF’                   womb

prepositional phrases (9.3.1). For example, depending on the referential context, sáà
dwaF’ may also be understood to mean ‘inside the belly.’5.4.2.4 Clausal compounds
A number of compounds consist of combined clause elements. Minimally, there is a
subject and a predicate (most often represented by a pronoun and a conjugated verb
respectively). As shown by the example below, other components may include objects,
negation clitics, locative complements and clitics, and adverbial ideophones.      compound noun with          gloss               explanation

the preceding example—it is always accompanied by yó.","[450, 451]"
"7.3.1.5 Pronominal object suffixes
Three object pronouns are verb word suffixes: second person singular (7.3.1.5.1), third
person singular (7.3.1.5.2), and the 4zíná variant of the 1&2 person plural (7.3.1.5.3). In
all three cases, there is morphophonological evidence of these suffixes’ interdependence
with the verb word; such evidence is lacking for other object pronouns (6.1.3.1).",[338]

bóm ‘one’). Additionally, it differs in that it is typically found in a dependent rather than
head position (cf. 5.2).         kâg        dâg tômná         the first chicken

specific numeral to which it corresponds. In contrast, it is probably derived from the

the ordinal noun series is underlined by the fact that it contains the ordinal suffix 4rì.","[437, 438]"

Noun phrases are constructions involving a head noun and, potentially, additional
elements. Like clauses (10.1.1) and prepositional phrases (9.3), noun phrases are left-
headed in Mambay. The following noun phrase constructions are used commonly:       noun + noun (including possessive pronouns and noun phrases)
       noun + adjective
       noun + numeral
       noun + specifier

6.1.3.2 Reflexive object pronouns
Members of a set of reflexive object pronouns are used whenever the object of a simple
clause is co-referential with its subject. Similar to what is found in many other African
languages (Watters 2000:213), reflexive object pronouns in Mambay are composed of the
noun )ínù ‘body, self’ and an inalienable possessive pronoun (6.1.4.2). Reflexive object
pronouns are as follows:                                  Reflexive object pronouns

       2PL hear:PFV        body:2PL.POSS.INALWhenever a paradigm of basic object pronouns (6.1.3.1) is being elicited with a transitive
verb, reflexive object pronouns are always substituted if the subject and object are co-

       2SG     greet:PFV      body:1SG.POSSLike reflexive verb suffixes (7.3.1.5), reflexive object pronouns reduce the number of
semantic participants in a transitive verb construction. However, they achieve this using
different strategies: while reflexive suffixes result in the detransitivization of a transitive
verb (7.3.2.1.2), reflexive object pronouns satisfy transitivity requirements by supplying
the transitive verb with an object. The detransitivization strategy is only moderately
                                              277
productive and is often accompanied by semantic shift (7.3.2.1.2), but the use of reflexive
objects is fully productive.       reflexive verb suffix:       mì gìì4ní                                   I consented

       2SG answer:PFV body:1SG.POSS.INALWhen reflexive object pronouns are plural, they may reflect either a reflexive or a
reciprocal function; such a distinction is not grammaticalized.       rò gìì         )író                         you (pl.) answered yourselves (i.e. each

"A final piece of evidence in support of the fourth explanation relates to vowel distribution
in ideophones. As described in 8.4.2.1.1, there are strong limitations on which vowels
may occur within the same ideophonic modifier. In most cases, a single vowel position is
permitted.       kpìgzìm        thick (dimension)

"5.3.3.3 Alienable vs. inalienable possession
A third and final axis concerns a morphologically formalized distinction of alienable vs.
inalienable possession. As stated in the previous section, this axis is morphologically
defined; this contrasts with optional vs. obligatory possession, which is syntactically
defined (5.3.3.2). And rather than signalling intrinsic properties of specific nouns (as is
the case with optional vs. obligatory possession), this axis deals with the relationship
between nouns: alienable vs. inalienable possession falls under what has been called
indirect vs. direct determination (Boyeldieu 1987:20). It is not uncommon for both
optional/obligatory and alienable/inalienable distinctions to interact in a single language
(Payne 1997:106), as is the case in Mambay.",[203]
"Importantly, there is no synchronic process by which irregular verbal nouns are derived
from verb stems. Historically, irregular verbal nouns appear to have undergone a
historical wave of unevenly applied derivational suffixation along with the rest of the
nouns in the language (5.1.3.2; this has been further described in Anonby 2008). This
process has resulted in irregular, lexicalized verbal nouns as follows:       verb stem             vestigial suffix          irregular verbal noun

10.1.2.3 The negative particle yá
Negation is always signalled by the clause-final negative particle yá along with some
additional indicator. For negation of an equivalence clause, yá is found in conjunction
with a third person negative non-Perfective pronoun híì (6.1.2.6) in initial subject
position.       híì          wáà           yá               he/she/it is not the chief

hìí (6.1.2.5) is used directly before yá.       wáà     hìí           yá                    the chief is not there / there is no chief

       chief   beThe negative particle yá is most commonly found with verbs (7.6.1.1.1) and, like the
other Indicative particles, is found clause-finally; the marking of negation in this position
is an areal feature (Watters 2000:207). Here, yá is accompanied by a modification of the
structure of subject pronouns, which mark realis value (see 6.1.2).       míì            té’là   yá                   I am not walking / I do not walk

       1SG walk:VNObjects may also be negated: modifications in tonal and segmental structure similar to
those applied to subject pronouns signal that negation concerns an object rather than the
verb or clause. This negation has the effect of focus on the object, and indicates that the
object is different item than the one which the listener expects. In the following cases,
the object’s final syllable is lengthened and a low tone is associated with it.       mìí         kó       ígàà      yá                   I didn’t see the child

modified by a numeral. However, it may be marked. This occurs more commonly with
human nouns (5.5.1.3).       nà4pùgzá           àtì                       two people
       PFX-person:PL     twoFor non-human nouns in particular, the pluralization of a counted noun puts its plural
nature into focus (5.5.1.3).        òlzá           àtì                          two wooden clubs
       wooden.club:PL twoIn addition to their use as noun modifiers in a noun phrase, numerals may appear as the
predicate of a verbless clause (9.1.1.1). Thus, when the noun + numeral constructions
given above stand alone, they constitute a clause:       kágà     àtì                                 there are two chickens (lit. ‘the chickens are
       chicken two                                    two’)       nààrá    tàrnágà                             there are seven clouds (lit. ‘the clouds are
       cloud    seven                                 seven’)9.1.1.2 Adverbial function
Although numerals are most commonly used to modify nouns (9.1.1.1), there are a few
cases in the data where they appear to be used adverbially:

       a crocodile doesn’t strike the water twice in the presence of an ibisRegarding the second example, note that the usual way of saying “twice” (or any other
multiplicative) is expressed as follows (cf. 7.6.1.2):       fàà     )éré               àtì               twice
       back:LF 3PL.C/I.POSS      two9.1.1.3 Absolute (mathematical) function
In addition to their other functions, numbers may also be used in an absolute way. In
contexts which use mathematical operations—for example, school, counting games and
the calculation of money—numbers relate to one another rather than to a syntactic head.","[427, 428, 429]"

Because the historical noun-suffix boundary is in many cases difficult to determine, and
because historically-suffixed nouns function synchronically as a morphologically simple
phonological word with respect to voicing (cf. 2.1.3.2), nasality (3.4) and tone (4.1.2.2),
such nouns are treated as roots in the present study.","[185, 186]"
"The structure and, in some cases, function of each type of construction are considered in
the following subsections.",[454]
"The following example serves as a case in point. As stated above, ideophones dominate
the word classes of adverb and adjective (cf. 8.2, introductory discussion). However,
except in the case of directional adverbs (and to some degree, TAM adverbs), it is
difficult to identify any adverbs or adjectives which are not ideophonic. Quantifiers
(adverbial or adjectival) such as the following might be expected to distinguish
themselves formally from ideophonic qualifiers:       bî’           a bit, slowly, almost
         yâN7        halfway (measured horizontally)
       gáb           halfway (measured vertically)

However, in the language these quantifiers exhibit the non-canonical characteristics of
ideophones outlined in the discussion above (e.g., non-canonical structure, repetition and
repeatability, and highly variable intonation).","[403, 404]"
"7.5.4 Summary of negative verbal forms
Negative verb forms are marked with negation particles (7.5.2) and negative subject
pronouns (7.5.3). These forms are summarized in the following table:                             Negative verbal forms in Mambay                                                          verb shape and     negative

7.6 Expansions of verbal inflection
Expanded verb forms allow for functional enrichment of the categories in the basic
inflectional system. While some are formed by means of TAM indicators (7.6.1), others
are formed using possessive constructions (7.6.2) and complex inflectional constructions,
including serial and auxiliary verb constructions (7.6.3).",[377]
