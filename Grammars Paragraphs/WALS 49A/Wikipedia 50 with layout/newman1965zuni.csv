6. GRADATIONS OF MORPHEME LENGTH
   One of the pervasive features of Zuni structure is the presence of different
kinds of short and long forms of morphemes. The extensive sandhi reductions
discussed above (5) represent only one system of morpheme shortening. Cer-
tain forms of the personal pronoun also exhibit short and long alternants. The
short forms resemble the sandhi-reduced particles described in 5.2, in that they
always appear without a final vowel when they occur in utterance-medial posi-
tion before any consonant. But because the pronominal short forms also show
unique features not found in sandhi processes or elsewhere in the language,
they are treated as part of the lexicon. For example, the utterance-final alter-
                                                      ZUNI GRAMMAR             29Hants ho^o I, to'9o you, and ?a*ni his, hers, its appear in utterance-medial as
ho*\ to9, and ?an; the unique feature here is the vowel shortening. Alternat-
ing with the long forms hovno we and to?no you (plural subject) are the short
 forms hon and ton; the dropping of the glottal stop is the unique element in
these cases.
    Differences in morpheme length are likewise characteristic of some patterns
itf affix alternants (4.1), such as the ?a-a-0 pattern (e.g., -?anna, -anna, -nna,
future tense or nonpast conditional) and the simplex-geminate-glottal pattern
 (e.g., -se, -sse, -^se, hortatory).
    Finally, the morphological process of abbreviation (8.9) also results in
short forms of longer morphemes, such as we-, abbreviated from wekwi foot.
    All of these factors—the various types of sandhi reduction, the short and
long variants of personal pronouns, some of the affix-alternant patterns, and
abbreviation of stems—combine to present a complex picture in which the
'/tin I morpheme characteristically manifests a gradation ranging from the
full-length to a variety of shorter alternants.

    Words are identified by their distinctive inflectional suffixes as either verbs,
nouns, or personal pronouns; particles are uninflected words. To be a complete
word, an inflected form must have one final suffix marking the inflection.
Several derivational layers may underly the single inflectional sufiix which
finishes the word. Thus, -ka, past tense, is the verb-marking inflection in the
following derivational expansions: ?apc?i-ka he cut it, ?apc?i-nap-ka they cut
it, 9apc?i-sle'-nap-ka they were cutting it, ^a'w-apc^i-sle'-nap-ka they were cut-
ting them.
    Verbs are inflected for tense, mode, and subordination, nouns for number,
and pronouns for number and case.","[28, 29, 30]"

12. T H E PARTICLE
    12.1. General Features. In distinction to all other classes of words, particles
are uninflected. They constitute a relatively large portion of the vocabulary.
From a sampling of the basic roots in the Zuni dictionary, roughly a third
of the entries are particles.
   Syntactically, particles cover a wide range of functions. Like nouns, they
may be employed as substantives. Although no system of semantic categories
can be established for distinguishing nouns from particles, some differentia-
tions can be discerned. All kinship terms, names of animals, and indefinites
 (e.g., someone, something), for example, are particles; all body parts, items
of clothing, and tools are nouns. The terms for plants, however, are not con-
sistent in their word classification: tobacco and words for varieties of corn
 (blue corn, yellow corn, etc.) are particles, but most plant names, including
cactus, onion, and terms for parts of the corn plant, are nouns. In derivations
formed by sufiixation, of course, the noun or particle membership of the word
is determined by the suffix: thus, although ?asek?a pine tree is an unanalyzable
basic particle, homa-tta-nne juniper tree (literally a growing collectivity of
juniper leaves) is a noun because it is derived by -tta (to be) a growing col-
lectivity, which forms nouns of class 1; c?ikwkwa bark, skin is a basic noun
root but ?isi?na-ka inner bark is a particle, for it ends in the particle-forming
-ka, instrumental.
   In addition to their substantive function, particles may also be used as
modifiers, a syntactic role which they share with some of the subordinating
inflections of the verb (9.23) and with some of the nouns referring to reified
qualities, such as wak^ali limp (object), k^asso chubby (person). Among
particles with a modifying function are tapnimte suddenly, ?ikwalte back, in
return, k?ayu fresh (object), youthful (person), lahafoma giddy (person).
The semantic types of modifiers which invariably belong to the particle class
are demonstratives and numerals.
 62      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONS   Relater functions (in, on, with, etc.) are expressed by particles as well as
 by enclitics (13). Only particles, however, serve as conjunctions.
   12.2. Particle-Forming Derivations. Particles may be secondarily constructed
 by prefixation, suffixation, or compounding.
    12.21. Prefix. Only one prefixed morpheme is affiliated with particles: ""Vw-
 (before the zeroed ?), ?a#- (before other consonants), plural, is appended to
particles referring to persons. This has the same form as one of the allomorphs
prefixed to verbs for the plural subject of intransitives or the plural object of
transitives (9.3152).
   horn ?a'w-ikina (they are) my younger sisters: ?ikina (particle) man's
younger sister.
   ?
    a'-siwi Zuni people: siwi (particle) Zuni person.
   A specialized use of this prefix occurs in ?a'-towa, a prayer term for corn,
based upon towa (particle) ancient, traditional, old-fashioned; apparently the
plural form carries the literal implication of the ancient ones.
   12.22. Suffixes. Some particle-forming suffixes are added only to particles
 (12.221); others are attached to verbs or to verbs and particles (12.222).
   12.221. The derivational suffixes added to particles are extremely limited in
scope. Each of them is restricted to particles of a particular semantic type.
    12.2211. -mme, familiar, is attached to the abbreviated first syllable (Cv or
CCv) of some kinship terms. In myths Coyote's name is sometimes found with
this suffix.
   lesn hoi ? ay ? ap su-mm 9uwen ?okwika when he (Woodpecker) was still on
top (of the tree trunk), that fellow Coyote woke up: su- abbreviated stem of
suski (particle) coyote, -mm < -mme (5.2).
  ku-mme ta'p ho,?o father's sister and I: ku- abbreviated stem of kuku
(particle) father's sister.
  ho-mme, term of familiarity used to an old lady or, by an older man, to a
young woman: ho- abbreviated stem of hotta (particle) grandmother, grand-
daughter.
    12.2212. -mo is suffixed to certain terms of kinship and ceremonial relation-
ship to form words which are pronounced in reciprocal series by the two par-
ticipants in the smoking ritual of the winter solstice ceremony. The sequence
is indicated by numbers in the list below, with each series including the word
spoken by one participant (a) and the response given by the other (b).
     1) (a) taccu-mo < taccu (particle) father; (b) tale-mo < tale (particle)
woman's brother's son, woman's dan brother.
     2) (a) papa-mo < papa (particle) older brothm (b) mwe-mo < iuwe
                                                      ZUNI GRAMMAR            63 (particle) man's younger brother.
      3) (a) kaka-mo < kaka (particle) mother's brother; (b) k?asse-mo <
  9
k asse (particle) man's sisters child.
      4) (a) nana-mo < nana (particle) grandfather, grandson; (b) tosle-mo
< tosle (particle) a ceremonial relationship, the details of which could not
be obtained (9a*tosle, the plural, is bogeymen).
     5) (a) ^ale-mo < ^ale (particle) a ceremonial relationship; (b) 9uwaka-
mo < ^uwaka (particle) a ceremonial relationship.
    12.2213. -(V)% alternative, is added to the first in a pair of kinship terms.
It apparently carries a humorous connotation, the implication being that the
speaker poses the alternative because of ignorance. The particle hapis or is
ordinarily employed to denote an alternative.
    ta' hxP yam papa-* suw hoi tena'n hakk^anna again I will ask my older
brother or younger brother to sing: papa (particle) older brother.
    taccu-' papa father or older brother: taccu (particle) father.
   12.2214. -na?, similitive, is suffixed to tribal names and indicates behavior
like or in the manner of the tribe.
   pacu-na? k9akweye he lives like a Navaho: pacu (particle) Navaho.
   siwi-na9 in the Zuni manner: siwi (particle) Zuni.
   12.2215. -^ma, vernacular, is used with names of tribes or other groups of
people to refer to their language.
   k?assita'kwe-?ma pene say it in Isleta: k?assita'kwe (particle) Isteta.
   melika-^ma peyekka he was talking in English: melika (particle) White
Man, Anglo.
   12.2216. -pi or -9pi, interrogational, is appended to indefinite particles to
form interrogatives.
   kwa?-pi what (did you say)?: k w a ? (particle) something perceptible.
   ko?-p torn leyaye how do you feel?: ko ? (particle) something intangible,
-p < -pi.
   ko'wi-?p tey^a how much is it?: ko'wi (particle) few.
   2uwa-p vuhsi who (is) that?: cuwa (particle) someone.
   12.222. All particle-forming derivations suffixed to inflected-word stems are
added to verbs. Some of these suffixes may be attached to particles as well.
   12.2221. -kwa9, suffixed to some 10b verbs denoting colors, forms words re-
ferring to ceremonial or otherwiie valued objects.
   he' lupc9i-kwa-na-nne the color of yellow ceremonial clay: he' abbreviated
item of heli (noun clan 1) cUy, mud, hipc9i-kwa? yellow corn, hipc^i (verb
data 10b) to be or btcom* ytllow, -k""a < -kwav, -na (to be) objects on the
surface, -nne lingular.
64       UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONS  ho9 fiwakw 9illi / have a turquoise stone: tr""a (verb class 10b) to be or
become blue, green, -kw < -kwa?.
  k?oha-kwa9 white corn, ceremonial white shell necklace: k?oha (verb class
10b) to be or become white.
   12.2222. -ka, instrumental, appears to be attached only to verbs of class 9.
  tena-ka phonograph: tena (verb class 9a) to be music.
  tesu-kk^a-na-ka potbellied stove: tesu (verb class 9b) to be warm indoors,
-kk?a causative, -na static.
  ^aciya* ^otta-ka knife-sharpener: ^aciya* knives, ^otta (verb class 9b) to be
sharp.
  he-ppo-ka wahtanne wallet, purse: he (noun class 1) metal, coin, -ppo (to be)
objects in a deep container (forms class 9 verbs), wahtanne bag.
   12.2223. -k9an, multiplicative, is added to numerals, which are particles,
and quantifiers, some of which are verbs.
   le9 hot 9imat susk 9ikwanan va'witena-k9an ^antekkunahka after saying this
to him, Coyote asked him four times: 9a*witen (particle) four.
  ha^i-k^an ^utteka he bit him three times: ha,?in (particle) three.
  his ^emma-k^an lesnuka he did it very many times: ?emma (verb class 2)
to increase.
    12.2224. -(V) # k w e, agentive, is suffixed to particles as well as verbs. It is
most commonly used to form a collective term referring to the members of
a group—tribal, national, societal.
   he'musVkwe the Jemez people: he'musi (particle) Jemez*
   mu'ma-*kwe the Mormons: mu'ma (particle) Mormon.
   sa-ya-pa-*kwe members of the Masked God Society: sa (noun class 2) bone,
-ya (to be) a growing mass (sa-ya [to be\ a horn), -pa plural subject of
transitive verbs (forms verbs of class 9).
   k9ak9ali-*kwe people of the Eagle Clan: k?ak9ali (particle) eagle.
   temaya-*kwe one who watches: temaya (verb class 9a) to watch.
   c?ina*w ?as-na-*kwe schoolchildren, literally those who have made papers:
 ?
c ina*w < c^maTwe?papers, ^asa (verb class 6a) to make, -na static.
   12.2225. -k?i, personal, is attached to particles or verbs.
   cawa-k?i young man, son: cawa (particle) young man.
   lassi-k?i man, man of the house, husband: tassi (verb class 2) to become old.
   ta'la-k?i male relative by marriage: ta'la-, a bound stem occurring in
ta'la-'kwin (particle) (home of) man's relatives by marriage.
   A number of unanalyzable particles denoting persons appear to contain
this sufifix: ?akcek?i boy, son, kacik?i girl, daughter, ?okaccik?i old lady, makk^i
woman with children.

 noun compounds: noun plus noun and noun plus verb (10.32). But com-
 pound particles may be formed by a wider variety of word-class combinations.
 Thefirst-positionelement in a particle compound may be a noun or particle
 stem having a monosyllabic (Cv or CCv) form, either based upon a mono-
 syllabic root or abbreviated from a longer form. A first-position noun may
 combine with only a verb; a particle may combine with a verb, a noun, or
 another particle.
   Examples of noun-plus-verb compounds are: se-maye corn-husk headdress
 worn by members of the newe'kwe Clown Society, containing se (noun class
 1) corn husk, maye' (verb class 8a) to have angular projections (e.g., corners
 protruding from the sides of the head); we-hi*nihna an irresponsible person,
 containing we (noun class 2) animal, hi'nihna (verb class 9b) to be irrespon*
sible. Combinations of this type may end with particle-forming suffixes, as in
mo-pinna-ka hail, containing mo (noun class 1) spherical object, pinna (verb
class 9a) to be windy, -ka instrumental.
   Examples of particle-plus-verb compounds are: tu-tassi old nag, containing
tu- abbreviated from tu'si (particle) horse, lassi (verb class 2) to become old;
pa-k?awisa Navajo Water-Carrier (the Zuni nickname of a Navaho man),
containing pa- abbreviated from pacu (particle) Navaho, k^awisa (verb class
6a) to bring water. Particle-forming suffixes are added to these combinations
as well as to the noun-plus-verb type: pa-lokk?a-*kwe Ramah Navahos, con-
taining pa- < pacu Navaho, lokk9a (verb class 10b) to be or become gray,
- (V) *kwe agentive.
   Examples of particle-plus-noun compounds are: su-tekwkwante stupid
Coyote (an epithet occurring frequently in folktales), containing su- abbre-
viated from suski (particle) coyote, tekwkwante (noun class 1) a stupid per-
son; me-lrku a rich Anglo, containing me- abbreviated from melika (particle)
Anglo, White Man ( < English ""American""), li'ku (noun class 1) rich
person ( < Spanish ""rico"").
   Examples of particle-plus-particle compounds are rare: ho-tonaSi Old Lady
Badger (a Zuni nickname of an Anglo woman), containing ho- abbreviated
from hotta (particle) grandmother, granddaughter, tonasi (particle) badger,
13. ENCLITICS  As distinct from suffixii, •nditics are loosely postposed to complete words;
when added to infltcttd words, enclitics follow the inflectional suffixes. Most
enclitics appear to be frttly ittirhtd to words of any class. The allomorphs
of enclitic morphemes «rt iJtHtrinlhtd by the final phoneme of the word.

water, to be a lake (ma9 k9aya Salt Lake); tewan-kwin east, containing

   14.1. The Minimal Utterance. An intonation, either 1-3 ' * • or 3-1, marks
the end of a minimal utterance (1.6). On the basis of syntactic structure,
two types of minimal utterance may be distinguished, the utterance which
lacks a predicate and the sentence type of utterance which contains a predicate.
   14.2. The Nonpredicative Utterance. A particle of affirmation or negation
may form a total utterance: 9e yes, ?elta no. Zuni abounds in particles having
an exclamative force, and these may be used singly or in combination as utter-
ance units: he', an exclamative of surprise, used only by men; holo, an ex-
clamative of negation; holo ?etta oh, no.
   Casual speech employs a variety of stereotyped utterances which lack a
predicate. Taunts and encouragements are primarily of this type: wan s torn
sola (literally wait then you scorpion) all right for you, scorpion, tern his tov
wiha (still very you baby) you're still just a baby, ^awisk^at to,?o (un-
expectedly-fortunate you) good for you. In sacred situations, k?eccannissi
happy is the standard reply to the formal greeting, How have you been these
past days? A common formula used by women in mourning is hana* ^ice
ho?n?a'wan (taccu) oh, our dear (father), the final word of the utterance
being reserved for the appropriate kin term.
   Utterance fragments, which omit the predicate expressed in a preceding
utterance, are normal in everyday speech. In reply to Where should I put it?,
one may answer tattan ^ePa by the tree as well as tattan ^ePan ^a^u put it by
the tree. Words joined in a copular relationship, lacking a predicate, also
constitute an utterance: cuwap 9uhsi (who that) who is that?
   14.3 The Sentence. The predicative utterance, or sentence, is the most
frequent utterance type encountered in any of the styles from which I have
gathered material—casual speech, stories, or prayers. It is identified by the
occurrence of a predicate. The minimal sentence is composed of a single
word, a finite verb expressing a predication and the number of the subject.
When no substantive appears in the sentence to specify the subject, the third
person is understood: 9ika (he) came; 9a'w-ika (they) came, 9a'w- plural
subject.

 19, ANALYSIS OF THE S I N T I N C B    15.1. Sentence Types. The two types of sentences occurring in Zuni—the
simple and the complex—can be described in terms of the clauses they con-
tain, the clause being defined as a predication. The simple sentence is com-
posed of a single independent clause. The complex sentence is made up of one
or more dependent clauses and one independent clause. Two formal charac-
teristics identify the complex sentence: 1) a dependent clause always precedes
its governing independent clause; 2) the predicate verb of the dependent
clause is marked inflectionally by one of the subordinating suffixes (see 9.23
for examples of complex sentences containing these suffixes).
   15.2. Components of the Sentence. The only necessary and sufficient com-
ponent of the sentence is the predicate. A sentence may also contain sub-
stantives, functioning as subjects or objects. Either one of these basic syntactic
structures, predicate or substantive, may appear in the minimal form of a
single word or in the expanded form of a phrase, containing modifiers, com-
plements, or parallel constructions. In all styles of the language, expanded
predicates and substantives which have specialized meanings appear with great
frequency (10.23, 10.31); constructions of this type offer a productive source
for the formation of new lexemes.
   The two major structures and their expansions will be described in the
following subsections.
    15.21. The Predicate. The minimal predicate, consisting of a single word,
can be formed only by a verb. The verb with a subordinating suffix may func-
tion as the minimal component of a dependent clause (9.231, 9.232). The
verb with an inflection other than a subordinating suffix can form the minimal
component of an independent clause (9.21, 9.22). Examples are:
   ?
     ito-nan ""V-ka after eating, (he) went: -nan subordinate with the same
subject as that of the following verb, -ka past.
   ?
     ito-p ho 9 p a'n-uwa after (he) eats, I will go: -p < -ppa subordinate with
a different subject from that of the following verb, -uwa future.
    15.211. One type of expanded predicate is composed of a verb preceded by
its complement. Some of the subordinate verbs—those suffixing the resultative
subordinate (9.235) or the adjunctive subordinate (9.233) —may function as
complements.
   ho 9 tata- ? kan ^a'ka I went to hunt: - ? kan resultative subordinate.
   tene*-n hakk^ekka he was asking him to sing: -n adjunctive subordinate.
  Verbs containing the suffix which denotes the future tense or the nonpast
70     UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONSconditional (9.213) are complements of the defective verb ?iyaha to intend to,
to want to in its various forms.
   ho? cun-9an ?iyahka I intended to stop: 9an < 9anna future.
   teya-k?an ?iha he wants to carry it: -k?an < -kvanna future.
   tene*na'w-e? tiha they want to sing: -e^ future.
   Nouns, pronouns, and particles, as objects of the verb, take the syntactic
role of complements.
   te-mm ?iyoka it froze, literally it became a board: -mm < -mme9 singular,
te (noun class 2) board.
   torn ho""* ?uttenna 7 will bite you: torn you (singular object).
   suski koalas 9anikwakka Coyote said to Crow: koalas < k^alasi (par-
ticle) crow.
    15.212. In addition to complements, modifiers provide another means
for expansion of the predicate. This adverbial function is assumed by verb
stems, by some subordinate verbs, and by a variety of particles. Certain verbs
of location and movement can be modified by a verb whose stem is immediately
preposed to form a close-knit construction.
   tuwa yalto^ka (they) were on top standing: luwa to stand.
   tewana* hoi ?imat tat ?allukka every day, perhaps, it seems he went about
hunting: tat < lata to hunt.
   Examples of subordinate verbs acting as predicate modifiers are:
   ta'cis tarn tununu k?um capin ?ePan ^iso9 yatasa-* ^aya^ka meanwhile
Woodpecker, making croaking noises, was perched on top of the place where
the burnt tree trunk was standing: - (V) • contemporaneous subordinate, ?iso?
yaiasa (verb class 6a) to make croaking noises, literally to remove the piece
of straw placed across (the opening of the throat).
   ya'na-9 powaye he is standing ready: -9 adjunctive subordinate, ya'na (verb
class 9a) to be ready.
   tesla-niss? peka he spoke fearfully: -nissi9 adverbial subordinate, tesla-
bound stem occurring in tesla-na (verb class 6a) to be afraid.
   The following are some examples of particles which function as modifiers of
the predicate.
   ^ik^alt Vnan . . . after going back . . . : ^ik^alt < ^ik^atte (par-
ticle) back.
   summ ?uwen sis ^ayyucPatika that fellow Coyote was very much sur-
prised: sis (particle) very, very much.
   Vwitena-k^an 9antekkunahap . . . after asking him four times . . . :
   ?
-k an (particle-forming) multiplicative, Vwitena- < Vwiten (particle) four.
   17.213. Complements and modifiers may themselves occur in an expanded
form, of course, in the predicate.

    a'ma horn ^an tuna* ^iiuwahk^a (let's-see me for eyes cause-to-run-around)
let's see you make my eyes run around: horn ^an tuna* is an expanded com-
plement of the verb ?iiuwahk?a.
   ta' ho9 yam papa* suw hot tena'n hakk?anna (again I one's-own older-
brother-or younger-brother perhaps to-sing will-ask) again I will ask my older
or perhaps younger brother to sing: yam papa* suw hoi tena'n is an expanded
complement of the verb hakk9anna.
   tu's 9akka hon ?a*ka (horse by we went) we went by horse: tu*s 9akka is an
expanded modifier of the verb va'ka.
   homatt^an ^ePan teiu'Van ?icu*nan s ?aika (literally at-juniper-tree at-
standing in-the-shade lying-down then fell-asleep) after lying down in the
shade where the juniper tree was standing, he fell asleep: homatt^an ?ePan
teiu'Van is an expanded modifier of the subordinate verb 9icu*nan.
   15.22. The Substantive. The minimal substantive is either a noun, pronoun,
or particle. Any of these word types may function syntactically as the subject
of a verb or as the- object complement of a verb or particle.
  ?
   a*c ^ik^alt kwatoka (they-two back went-in) they two went back in: 9a*c
 < V c i (pronoun) is the subject of the verb kwatoka.
  le9 hoi tarn tunun ^anik^p . . . (this perhaps wood making-repeated-
thudding-sounds saying-to) after saying this to Woodpecker . . . : tarn
tunun < tamme9 tununu (particle) Woodpecker is the object of the verb
?
 anikwap.
  tern powan manikka cuwa?ka (board that-which-is-standing under was-lying)
he was lying under the table: iem powan < iemme9 powanne (noun class 1)
table is the complement of the particle manikka.
    15.221. The expansion of substantives is primarily achieved through the
use of modifiers. Three types of subordinate verbs may modify substantives.
    he* cuwap his tenan cofya-? tene*?a well, who is singing the very pretty
song?: -9 adjunctive subordinate, co?ya (verb class 9b) to be pretty.
    am hoi yam 9allase'-n ?ona yutevcik?ap . . . after he had tired out the
one he was chasing . . . : -n subordinate before the agentive ?ona, vallase*
 (verb class 8a) to be chasing repeatedly.
   9
     imat tanaya patto-9kowa9 iat ?allukka it seems he went about hunting at
Growing-Trees-Came-to-an-End: -9kowa? past agentive subordinate, paito
 (verb class 9a) to have an end; tanaya paito^kowa9 is a place name, with the
literal meaning wood'growing-in-a-mass-on-the-surface that-which-came-to-
an«endx
   The following cxAinplM llluitrate particles, pronouns, and nouns function-
ing us nubntAnflvp mmllfirn,
72      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONS   hasuski mo?l 9a*ci 9ahnan . . . after getting the two coyote-weed berries
. . . : hasuski (particle) coyote weed, V c i (pronoun) they (dual), the two.
   k V tana-nne (tubes large-one) large intestines: -nne singular, tana (noun
class 1) large (object).
    15.222. Expansion of substantives is also effected by complementation.
Particles, pronouns, or nouns may function as the object complements of sub-
stantives which are themselves either particles, nouns, or certain subordinate
verbs.
   pok?a tat ^allukkowa9 the one who went about hunting jackrabbits: the
particle pok?a jachabbit is the complement of tat ?allu-kkowa9, a close-knit
verb construction (15.212) containing -kkowa9 past agentive subordinate with
?
  allu (verb class 7) to go about, tat < tata (verb class 9a) to hunt.
   horn 9ill ^ona (me having the-one-who) my spouse: the pronoun horn me
is the complement of ?ill ?ona, a sandhi reduction of ^illi-p' ?ona, composed of
?
 ona one who, -0 subordinate before the agentive ?ona with ?illi (verb class
9a) to have.
   ^aciya* ^ottaka knife sharpener: the noun ^aciya-', containing - (V) • plural
with 9aciya (class 1) knife, is the complement of 9otta-ka, composed of -ka
 (particle-forming) instrumental with ^otta (verb class 9b) to be sharp.
   pewi yaltonne bedspread: the noun pewi (class 1) bed is the complement of
yatto-nne, containing -nne singular, which forms a noun derivation from a
verb construction (10.31) when suffixed to yatto (verb class 9a) to be on top
of-
   yam hasuski mowev ?itunekkow ?akka . . . because he (was) the one who
made eyes for himself with coyote-weed berries . . . : the noun phrase
hasuski mo-we?, composed of -we9 plural with mo (noun class 1) spherical
object, berry and hasuski (particle) coyote weed, is the complement of ?itune-
kkow, containing -kkow < -kkow past agentive subordinate with ?itune- <
9
 itune' (verb class 8a) to cause oneself to have eyes.
  15.223. In contrast to predicates, substantives may be expanded by coordi-
nation.
  tewana* ha* k?ohanna?kowa? ?oksik? ta'p pok?a tat ?allukka every day he
went about hunting cottontails and jackrabbits in the sagebrush: the coordi-
nated substantive is composed of ^oksik9 < ^oksik^o (particle) cottontail
rabbit, ta'p (particle) and, pok?a (particle) jachabbit.
  Some of the numbers are expanded substantives formed by coordinated
particles: 9astemta ta*p topinte (ten and one) eleven; kwilikpan 9aatemia ta*p
Vwiten (twice ten and four) twenty-four.
                                                     ZUNI GRAMMAR             73    15.3. Incorporation. Substantives, in the form of particles or nouns, may
 be incorporated into the verb complex, and verb prefixes are then preposed to
 the substantive. However, the two components are treated phonologically as
 separate word units, for each receives the word stress on its first syllable:
 ^i'-kih ?as-ka they made each other ceremonial brothers, containing ?i#-
 reciprocal (a prefix for verbs), -fcih < kihe (particle) ceremonial brother,
 ?
  as- < 9asa (verb class 6a) to make, -ka past. These constructions with in-
 corporated substantives appear very rarely in the types of material which I
 have collected (casual speech, stories, prayers), and the incorporated forms
 are grammatical alternatives of the more common, syntactically looser con-
 structions: thus, kih ^i'y-as-ka, with the reciprocal prefix attached to the
 verb, is an optional variant of the preceding example.
    Incorporated substantives may function as subjects of the verb as well as
 objects: in ^as ""Vw-allu-kka (hand\s\ they-moved-about) he felt about with
 his hands, the prefix ?a*w- indicates that ?as < ?asi (noun class 1) hand is a
plural subject, for the verb vallu (class 7) to move about is intransitive.
Even though the plural element is a verb prefix, it may be attached to the
substantive in order to pluralize the total construction: compare the preceding
example with ?a*w-as ""Vw-allu-kka they felt about with their hands. When
nouns are the incorporated substantives, they are usually not inflected for
number, as in the preceding examples of an incorporated subject or in the
following incorporated object: ?i-we taku-ka he wore the fur pieces around his
neck, containing ?i- reflexive (a verb prefix), we (noun class 1) fur of small
animal, taku (verb class 9a) to wear around the neck, -ka past. In some in-
stances incorporated nouns take inflectional suffixes, but the cases are too few
to permit the conditions for this practice to be determined: la'k9 susk ?a'-tuna-*
lupc^i-nna-o' today coyotes have yellow eyes, in which the verb complex con-
tains V - plural subject (a verb prefix), tuna (noun class 1) eye, -(V)'
plural (a noun suffix), !upc?i (verb class 10a) to be or become yellow, -nna
static, -0 present.
  15.4. Concord. Negative sentences and sentences involving subject or object
number demand syntactic concord.
   15.41. Negative Concord. Constructions in which the verb contains a nega-
tive suffix are accompanied by a negative particle. The particle 9efta, which
occurs independently ai the negative utterance no (14.2), is the element which
appears with predicates containing imperative or permissive verbs; with verba
having other Infliction*, the nigative particle is kwa?.

 THE ZUNIS have been studied intensively over a long period of time. The
 recent Zuni bibliography compiled by Roberts contains some four hundred
 entries.1 Anthropological interest in these Southwestern Indians was initiated
 by the Bureau of American Ethnology in 1879, when one of the staff, Mr.
 James Stevenson, accompanied by his indomitable wife Tilly, visited the
 pueblo.2 In the same year the Bureau hired Frank Hamilton Cushing, who
 shortly thereafter went to live with the Zunis. Cushing remained among them
 for five years, and, though it is difficult to separate anthropological legend
 from fact during this early period, he was reputed to have become ""one of the
 tribe"": he was adopted into the Macaw Clan, became Head Priest of the Bow,
 and mastered the language of these fascinating savage folk.3
    From the beginning of anthropological work with the Zunis, reports and
 Studies have included native terms. The style of transcribing these terms has
 undergone changes, revealing shifts in the attitude of field workers toward the
 function of the language in anthropological studies. The first phase of Zuni
publication, which began in the early 1880's and lasted for about thirty years,
was characterized by the widespread transcription practice of placing hyphens
bttwaen syllables: thus, Cushing wrote lassinaye the corn grows old as thla-shi-
nal-yt; Mrs. Stevenson transcribed ?a'siwi the Zunis as Ah-shi-wi.4 In this
p#rlod when cultural studies emphasized religion, ceremonialism, and folklore,
transcribed native terms provided authenticity and, perhaps, local color for
rtftrrlng to concepts which, it was realized, could not be adequately translated.
lityond obtaining word translations, however, the early students showed no
Intartst In the Zuni language as an object of study, though J. W. Powell,
director of the Bureau, was active in stimulating linguistic researches elsewhere.
I'or the most part, each worker transcribed Zuni words in his own version of
BnglUh spelling. Fewkes, for example, gave evidence of his own dialect affilia-
tions by distributing V s "" generously throughout his transcriptions of Zuni
words, which contain no V sounds of any kind: his rendition of VtoJle
ho$eymen was ar-toish-ley.D

    From 1910 to 1915 a new trend became discernible in the mode of transcrip-
 tion. The practice of hyphenating syllables was abandoned, and anthropologists
 attempted to symbolize the sounds of the language rather than merely to
 render native words in English spelling. The shift of emphasis was evident in
 the later work of Tilly Stevenson. The transcriptions in her ethnobotanical
 study of 1915 indicated stress, contained superscript symbols over the vowels,
 and showed an awareness of Zuni double consonants: her transcription for
 towa yalanne Corn Mountain, for example, was To'wa yal'lanne.6 Perhaps the
 most sophisticated treatment of the language in that decade occurred in Kroe-
 ber's brief article of 1916.7 Here, utilizing his many years of experience in
 working with California Indian languages, Kroeber explicitly referred to such
 phenomena in Zuni as consonant length (see 2.3, below), vowel quantity, the
 unvoicing of final syllables (5.1), the ""surd L,"" the glottal stop, and a series of
 globalized consonants. In spite of his perceptive observations, his transcriptions
were faulty and inaccurate. Long vowels were seldom indicated in his rendi-
tions, and, conversely, double consonants appeared too frequently: he tran-
scribed citta mother correctly as tsitta, but tutu drink and wowo father's
mother were overcorrected to tuttu and wowwo.
    It was characteristic of this period that linguistic material, when it was
collected, was gathered for ethnographic purposes; in this context there was
no reason to strive for precision in transcribing native sounds or for a system-
atic morphological analysis in making translations. Throughout her extensive
publications on Zuni culture Parsons maintained the same type of faulty
transcription over a span of more than twenty-five years (1915-1941).8 The
emphasis on collecting Zuni language material for its ethnographic content
was also evident in Bunzel's work. The large body of myths, ritual poetry,
and other texts which she collected were invaluable as literary data, but the
material was transcribed so inconsistently and inaccurately that it could not
provide a reliable basis for a grammatical treatment.9
   Although Bunzel's grammar, published in 1934, might be expected to reflect
some of the linguistic trends current in the early phonemic era, it was repre-
sentative, rather, of the period in which anthropologists were avidly collecting
large quantities of ethnographic data, without bothering about linguistic details
in their transcription of Zuni forms. Interestingly enough, the word ""phoneme""
appeared in the grammar, but it was obviously an afterthought rather than an     6. Stevenson, 1915, p. 35.

 ""All short vowels in unaccented syllables are variable or obscure in quality.
 There is an alternation of o and u and of e and i in such positions, although in
 positions of importance they are distinct phonemes.""10 The phonological
 portion of the grammar was handicapped by the highly inaccurate raw mate-
 rial of the texts upon which it was based. Like Kroeber, Bunzel was aware of
 the distinction between long and short vowels and between single and geminate
consonants, but she was no more careful than he in distinguishing them. More
seriously, globalized stops and fortis unaspirated stops were frequently con-
 fused, with the result that many words were transcribed with initial p ? - or t?-,
which are structurally impossible in that position (2.1). The morphology was
marred by an overzealous attention to fine shades of meaning and a correspond-
ing inattention to the systematic analysis and classification of forms. But, until
the 1950's, Bunzel's grammar was the only linguistic source among the several
hundred publications dealing with the Zunis.
    My linguistic work with Zuni began in 1952. I selected this language for
several reasons. Among languages of the Southwest, Zuni appeared to be re-
latively simple and transparent in its sound system and in its morphological
structure; I wanted to obtain data which would provide beginning linguistic
students with easier drill material than the Isleta and Laguna data I had
previously gathered. Zuni students attending the University of New Mexico,
furthermore, offered me the convenient possibility of getting informants with-
out suffering the acute frustrations of doing a lengthy field study within the
hostile environment of the pueblo. This grammar, consequently, is based upon
work done in a large number of brief sessions with Zuni college students, sup-
plemented by short field trips to Zuni pueblo for intensive work with older
Informants. Finally, although the Zunis were one of the most intensively
studied groups of the Southwest, their language had never been described in
terms of a modern structural treatment. The linguistic structures of other
Southwestern Indians, on the other hand, had been described in the 1930's
and IMO's, when Whorf had worked and published on Hopi, Halpern on
Yuma, Hoijer on the Apachean languages, and Trager on Tanoan. 11
  U p to the present time my publications on Zuni have consisted of a brief
phonemic description, an ethnolinguistic study, and a dictionary.12 In the
phonemic description and the dictionary, I used a ""practical"" orthography;

Zuni research I am grateful to the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthro-

informants during the summers of 1955 and 1956; to the University of New
Mexico for providing a sabbatical leave which permitted me to complete the

to cover preparation of the manuscript.

                                                               PHONEMICS1. PHONEMES AND ALLOPHONES
  The phonemes of Zuni include sixteen consonants—p, t, c, c, k, kw, ? , s, s,
d hp m, n, 1, w, y; ten vowels—i, i% e, e% a, a% o, o% u, u'; two stresses—strong
And weak; and three pitch levels.
  On the basis of allophonic types, the consonants may be grouped into three
mAJor classes: stops and affricates, spirants, and continuants.
     1.1. Stops and Affricates. Before vowels, p, t, and ? are voiceless, lenis, and
 UDASplrated; k, kw, c, and c are voiceless, fortis, and aspirated. The only con-
sonant of this group which has a perceptible allophone of articulatory position
ii k, which appears as a velar before o or u, as a palatal before a, e, or i.
    A phonetically glottalized consonant is produced when any stop, except the
glottal Stop, or an affricate is followed by a glottal stop. The velar release of
k, for example, is approximately simultaneous with the glottal release in k9ola
fM/#| and, similarly, the affricative and glottal stop are released as a fused
phonetic element in yapc9ika he cut himself. This fusion takes place across
Word boundaries as well as within word units: the t and ? form a unit phoneti-
cally in *lmat ?an tena'ka it-seems for-him he-sang, as does the c and 9 in V c
""llluka they-two put-it-in.
    A Stop or affricate is unreleased when it occurs before any consonant other
than tho glottal stop: e.g., the k is an unreleased velar stop in mokcinne elbow
»r *lkna like. As a parallel phenomenon, the first in a cluster of two identical
Stops or affricates is unreleased: the kk combination in ?ukka he gave it to him
Is pronounced as a long velar stop followed by a palatal release, and the
fllistsrs pp, tt, and w manifest the same phonetic characteristics in their
rpspictlva stop positions. On this basis a phonetically unreleased [k] is in-
ferprtttd as kw when it precedes kw: in mokwkwinne onion, for example, the
k*k* cluster is actualized as a long velar stop with a labiovelar release; the
clusters In vocci male or 9e2Ziye it remains are long dental stops with, respec-
tJvtly, an Alveolar and an alveopalatal affricative release. The interpretation of
| k | AS ths first unrtleaied kw In an identical cluster, and of [ t ] as thefirstun-
tf IdAMd e or 2 of An identical cluster is mads for rcAsons of phontmic sym-
matryi sll other consonants occur doubled. N o such phonetic complex AS [kw],
|fc|, or | tl] CAn Appear preconsonAntAlly,
 14      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONS    1.2. Spirants. The spirants are always voiceless. The sibilant s is a grooved
 alveolar; s, a grooved alveopalatal; and 1, a lateral. The phoneme h is a glottal
 spirant [h] before vowels, a velar spirant [x] before consonants: thus, the
 cluster hh in ?ahha pick it upl is actualized as a velar followed by a glottal
 spirant.
    1.3. Continuants. The continuants—m, n, 1, w, y—have optionally unvoiced
allophones before h or v , either within word units or across word boundaries:
the n in yanhaku breatbel or the w in ko'w horn ?an k^alu a-littte me for pour-
it-in, i.e., pour in a little for me, may be voiceless. Such unvoicing is especially
common when the continuant is preceded by a voiceless consonant as well as
followed by h or ? , as in lesn hoi thus perhaps or tevl ?asa pot make!
    1.4. Vowels. With the exception of a, the short vowels fluctuate between
 open and close varieties. The high vowels, i and u, appear most frequently as
 close types; occasionally an open i or u may be heard in a weak-stressed posi-
 tion. The open variety of e and o, however, is preferred; the most favorable
 conditions for the close types are the occurrence of weak-stressed e before y
 or weak-stressed o before w.
    The five short vowels assume an incremental length in the initial heavy-
stressed syllable of a word, when this syllable is open: e.g., the first a in
 tasasanne a stiff object is slightly longer than the other a's in the word and also
longer than the a-vowels in tattanne tree or in tampowanne wagon bow.
    Short vowels in utterance-final position may be unvoiced (5.1.): the terminal
a, for example, is optionally voiced or voiceless in 9icunan s ?atka after-lying-
down then he-slept.
    The long vowels manifest no perceptible variations in quantity or quality.
The long high vowels, i' and \T, are invariably close; e* and o' are nearly al-
ways open, though close vowels may occasionally be heard in rapid speech; a*
is always a low central vowel.
    1.5. Stress. The position of the strong stress is morphologically determin-
able, for this stress falls on the first syllable of the word unit. All other syl-
lables have the weak stress. No symbols will be used to indicate stress
phonemes. The word space will identify the syllable following space as the
locus of the strong stress: horn ?ansema ask me for it, but horn ?an sema order
it for me.
   In words of four syllables or more, a subphonemic secondary stress may
sometimes be heard on the penult or antepenult, occurring as a fluctuating
phenomenon. When it appears, it is considerably weaker in articulatory force
than the strong stress.
                                                       ZUNI GRAMMAR             15   Cutting across the phenomena of word stress are features of phrase stress,
whose details are not clearly understood, for they involve stylistic variables.
Some monosyllabic words, such as certain particles and pronouns, which retain
their strong stress when they occur initially in utterances or in clauses, may take
the weak stress when they are medial. The loss of strong stress seems to be
conditioned by a number of factors. It is more apt to occur in certain syntactic
combinations than in others: a modifying particle or pronoun is more likely to
be weakened in stress when it is governed by a particle than by a noun. Fre-
quency of usage appears to be another factor: certain high-frequency com-
binations of monosyllabic particles, such as kwa9 hoi something perhaps, are
nearly always actualized with a strong stress on the first particle and a weak
•tress on the second. But phrasal stress fluctuates considerably with style of
epeech: in the more deliberate types of utterance, such as prayers, even the
most commonly juxtaposed particles are each given a separate strong stress.
    1.6. Pitch. Three pitch levels characterize Zuni intonation: low (1), middle
  (2), high (3). Utterances usually begin with a middle pitch (2) and sag to a
 low pitch (1) before the end of the utterance is reached; but in a short utter-
ance the middle pitch is often maintained until the final intonational glide. At
 Utterance-medial pause points, such as the end of a dependent clause, a shallow
die occurs (1-2,2-3).
    The end of a minimal utterance is identified by one of two intonational pat-
terns. A rare intonation, occurring as a rhetorical device in storytelling, is the
•tecp rise in pitch located on the last syllable of the utterance, accompanied by
an exaggerated lengthening of the vowel (l-3 ,,# ). This intonation always falls
on a verb and denotes an event covering a long period of time: tat ^allukka
 (I-3,M) he went about hunting and hunting and hunting. The predominant
mark of the utterance terminus is the intonational fall (3-1). Thefirstsyllable,
always the strong-stressed syllable, of the final word in the utterance takes the
high pitch (3). If the terminal word contains only one syllable, it has a steep
drop in pitch. If, as is more frequent, there are several syllables in the last
word, the intonation drop is more gradual, being distributed over the remain-
ing lyllables. Examples are: iat 9allukka (3-1) he went about hunting, hop to9
Vne (3-1) where are you going?, Vnuwa^si (3-1) will he go?","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
"
8. TYPES OF MORPHEMES
  The morpheme units which enter into the construction of words are stem
forms of roots, suffixes, enclitics, prefixes, reduplicatives, suppletives, com-
pounding patterns, and abbreviations.
   8.1. Roots and Stems. In terms of their morpheme complexity, roots may l?e
classified into basic (unimorpheme) roots and derived (multimorpheme)
roots. Basic roots are selectively determined for class membership: ?ali to be
attractive is inherently a verb, 9alla shield a noun, and ?ale ceremonial relation-
ship a particle. The word class of derived roots is defined either by the
reference type of compounded roots (S.S) or by the last derivational sufiix
of other multimorpheme roots, for derivational suffixes are verb-forming,
noun-forming, or particle-forming.
   Most roots, whether basic or derived, have membership in only one class.
However, a number of the roots belonging to verb class 9 are also treated
as noun roots of class 1: ?uccu shirt, to wear a shirt, as in ^uccu-'we9 shirts
(-(V)'we?, plural on class 1 nouns) and ^uccu-^ka he wore a shirt (-^ka,
past tense on class 9 verbs). But many class 9 verb roots cannot function
as nouns, and many class 1 noun roots do not participate in verb formation.
Since this dual affiliation is found in no other classes and is manifested in only
                                                       ZUNI GRAMMAR             31certain members of class 9 verbs and class 1 nouns, it is interpreted as a
•elective overlapping of class membership rather than as a distinctive class of
roots.
   A root may appear in several stem forms for the operation of inflections
And derivations. For example, the root tena9u to sing occurs without modi-
fication in the present stem tena?u-0 he is singing and with modifications in the
preconsonantal past stem tena'-fca he sang and the prevocalic past stem
ten-e-kka he was singing,
    8.2. Suffixes. SufExation accounts for most of the formal machinery of word-
building in Zuni. Inflections for all the word classes are formed solely by
•uffixes. The inflectional categories of the verb are those of tense and tense-
mode (e.g., past tense, past conditional), mode (e.g., permissive, hortatory),
and subordination (e.g., contemporaneous subordinate, resultative subordi-
nate) . Nouns are inflected only for number in the singular and the plural.
Pronoun inflection includes case as well as number; because their inflections
ire unique and limited in scope, the pronouns will be treated synthetically as
paradigmatic forms rather than analytically as forms composed of stem and
luffix.
    In addition to the inflections, most of the derivations are expressed by
•uffixes. The verb-forming derivations cover several conceptual categories: a)
aspect (e.g., continuative, punctiliar), b) mode (e.g., negative, perceptive),
c) collective (e.g., to be objects growing together on the ground, to be objects
in a shallow container), d) voice (only the causative), e) number (only the
plural subject of transitive verbs), and f) mixed categories of aspect-voice
or aspect-voice-mode (e.g., mediopassive repetitive, conversive causative punc-
tiliar) . Noun derivations are formed only by suffixes indicating different kinds
of collectives (e.g., objects in a dispersed collectivity, objects in a wrapped
bundle). More than a dozen particle-forming suffixes express a variety of
derivational concepts (e.g., alternative, multiplicative, instrumental), which
cannot be conveniently grouped into any of the more familiar categories.
   8.3. Enclitics, In contrast to the suffix, the enclitic is a structurally loose
•lement attached to the end of a word, following any inflectional suffix that
may be present. The enclitic has greater freedom of distribution than a suffix:
the interrogative enclitic -?Si (13.1), for example, may be appended to any
word in the sentence.
   These morphemes comprise a small class of forms. Besides the interrogative,
the enclitics include the adversitive, the directional, the locative, and the
Inessive (13.2-13.9).
32      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONS   8.4. Prefixes. All prefixes are derivational. Involving only some half-dozen
morphemes, prefixation covers a relatively small area of the morphology as
compared to sufiixation. The categories of prefix morphemes refer to a) voice
(e.g., reciprocal, indirective), b) number (plural subject of intransitive verbs,
plural object of transitive verbs), c) aspect (only the inchoative), d) mode
(only the indeterminate), and e) a unique category, with a prefix indicating
natural phenomena (9.3112).
   8.5. Discontinuous Morphemes. Only one derivation, the inchoative, is
formed by the combination of a prefix and a suffix (9.33). This discontinuous
affix, demanded by certain verbs, is a formal coalescence of the prefix (9.3113)
and the suffix (9.3222), each of which functions alone as an inchoative when
attached to other verbs.
   Illustrating discontinuous morphemes on a syntactic level, one of the
negative particles (kwa9, 9etia) invariably accompanies a verb containing one
of the derivational suffixes expressing the negative (9.3213, 9.326, and espe-
cially 16.42).
   5.6. Reduplicatives. Reduplication is restricted to only one of the verb
classes. Reduplicative patterns are applied to express the mediopassive repetitive
(9.341) and the mediopassive semelfactive (9.342).
   8.7. Suppletives. Suppletion occurs in the complete replacement of a few
verb stems. It has the same function as one of the prefixes, that of indicating
the plural subject of intransitive verbs or the plural object of transitive verbs
 (9.35): 9ela be standing (singular subject) and tuwa be standing (plural sub-
ject) are functionally parallel to capi be burned and 9a""-capi, in which 9a*-
indicates the plural subject.
   8.8. Compounds. The morphological characteristic of a true compound
consists in the use of afirst-positionstem with the form Cv- or CCv-, which
may either be abbreviated or a full stem: me-9ose tramp, hobo (me- abbre-
viated from melika White Man, Anglo, ?ose to be hungry), pa-lokk9a-'kwe
Ramah Navajo (pa- abbreviated from pacu Navaho, lokk?a to be gray,
- (V) *kwe people of). Monosyllabic stems are particularly productive as first-
position elements in compounds: he-sonci-nne fork (he metal, sonci claw, -nne
singular), he-k9akwe-nne train (k?akwe house, to inhabit), k?a-cikwa-*we9 soda
pop (k9a liquid, cikwa to be sweet, -(V)#we? plural), k9a-9opi-*we9 beer,
vinegar (9opi to be sour). In addition to this morphological identification, the
compound is phonologically marked, like any other word unit, by having a
single heavy stress on its initial syllable (1.5).
   Only nouns and particles are formed by compounding. The type of refer-
ence designated by the compound determine! whether it if to be claued at a
                                                      ZUNI GRAMMAR             33 noun, and therefore inflected, or as an uninflected particle. In the examples
 given in the preceding paragraph, the word for tramp, hobo is a particle like
 other references, whether native or borrowed, to human beings: siwani rain
priest, mu'ma Mormon < English ""Mormon."" The word for fork belongs
 to the noun class and is inflected for singular and plural, like other references
 denoting man-made objects: sok?o-nne spoon (-nne singular), ma'kina-nne
 machine < Spanish ""maquina."" And the word for soda pop is a noun in-
flected only in the plural like any other noun indicating a mass: k?a-we?
liquid (we9 plural), maso-'we9 muscle < English ""muscle.""
   As distinct from compounds, syntactic constructions have more than one
heavy stress. But certain combinations of words—constructions with specialized
meanings and derivations from constructions (10.31, 15.3)—manifest some
of the unitary lexical characteristics of compounds. A construction such as
k9ate tasa (Fate bird-tail, tasa lengthened) may either mean lengthened
bird-tail or, as a specialized construction, magpie. Lexemes of this kind, formed
by syntactic constructions, are frequent in Zuni. Songs and prayers, in partic-
ular, employ specialized constructions, which sometimes show considerable
syntactic elaboration: thus, in songs, frogs are woliye tinan k?ayapa, literally
they-are-in-a-shallow-container they-sitting they-are-floating-in-water. Deriva-
tions from constructions are even more close-knit syntactic combinations, for
they are unified by an overt morphological change: the instrumental deriva-
tion -kka belongs to the entire construction as ^asi lana-kka thumb (9asi
finger, lana to be big); similarly, the singular inflection -nne is part of the
constructional lexeme in k9o-9 lana-nne glutton (k?o intestine, -? singular) or
in kV* tana-nne the large intestines (- (V) * plural). Though displaying some
superficial similarities to compounds, constructions of this kind are to be
differentiated from compounds, which can be formally identified by the pres-
ence of afirst-positionCv- or CCv- stem and a single heavy stress (2.2).
   8.9. Abbreviations. Abbreviated noun and particle stems are found in unit
words, compounds, and certain syntactic constructions. The suffix -mme
 (12.2211), denoting familiarity, is added to a Cv- or CCv- abbreviation of a
•tern: kw?a-mm ?uwenne that fellow Crow (k^a- abbreviated from k^alasi
crow, -mm sandhi-reduced from -mme, ?uwenne fellow). In compounds the
first-position element is the stem of a monosyllabic root with a Cv or CCv
structure, or it is the stem of a longer root abbreviated to this structure (8.8).
Similarly, the head term of a substantive construction may take the shape of
a Cv- or CCv- item, either the full form of a monosyllabic root or the ab-
breviated form of a longer root (10.23): li-? lilowa penny (li- abbreviated
from liya'U unit of money < Spanish ""real"", -v singular, lilowa red).
 34      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONS 9. T H E VERB     9.1. Verb Classes. The classes of the verb, with their roots and stems, are
  listed in Table 1. Each verb root appears in two morphologically determined
  stem forms, which, for convenience, are designated as the past and present
  stems. The past stem, besides adding the inflectional suffix of the past tense,
  is also used for other inflectional suffixes and for many derivational sufiixes
  as well. One of the derivations and several inflections other than the present
  tense are suffixed to the present stem. Only suffixal morphemes are affiliated
  with these verb stems; other types of morphemes—prefixes, reduplicatives,
  etc.—operate direcdy upon verb roots.
     As Table 1 indicates, some of the stems undergo secondary, phonologically
 determined reductions. Where the present or past stem occurs in two forms,
 the full form (presented first in the Table) is employed for zero sufiixes or for
 sufiixes beginning in a single consonant other than the glottal stop: e.g., the
 present tense -0 is added to the full form of the present stem, as in yata-0
  (class 9b) he is asking; the past tense -ka is suffixed to the full form of the
 past stem, as in kwayi-ka (class 4a) he emerged. Three types of reduced stems
 are to be distinguished: the prevocalic (pv), the preglottal (p ? v), and the
 preconsonant-cluster (pec) forms. The prevocalic form is used before suffixes
 beginning in a vowel: the repetitive -ela, a nonfinal suffix, is appended to the
 prevocalic past stem, as in kway-ela to emerge repeatedly. To the preglottal
 stem are added suffixes beginning in a glottal stop followed by a vowel: the
 subordinate -?appa is suffixed to the preglottal present stem, as in yat-?appa
 after asking. Suffixes beginning in two consonants, of which neither is a glottal
 stop, are attached to the preconsonant-cluster form, which is found only
 among verbs of class 8: e.g., -kka past is suffixed to the preconsonant-cluster
 form but -k?a causative to the full form of the past stem, as in tene-kka he
 sang but tene#-k9a to cause to sing; -ppa subordinate is attached to the pre-
 consonant-cluster form but -va present to the full form of the present stem,
 as in ?ito-ppa after eating but ?itoy-va he is eating.
    Verbs are differentiated into classes on the basis of two criteria: the mor-
phologically determined distinctions in a) present versus past stem treatment
and b) selection of suffix alternants. The distinctive features of each of the
verb classes are identified in the following comments.
    Class 1: Both stems retain the final root vowel. The present or imperative
inflection is -?a.
    Class 2: The final root vowel is zeroed in the present stem.
    Class 3: The root ends in a consonant (-w in 3a, -y in 3b, -n in 3c), which
it zeroed in the pait item.

"
   Class 4: Both stems retain the root vowel. The inflection -0 is a present or
imperative with 4a but only an imperative with 4b; the latter cannot form
a present tense directly but must first add the continuative derivation, form-
ing verbs of class 8, to which the present tense -?a may be added.
   Class 5: A unique change is efFected in the past stem of this class, whose
membership is limited to verbs derived by -?u, one of the causative derivations
 (9.323).
   Class 6: The root vowel is zeroed in the past stem. In 6a this is the only
change. Additional unique changes are involved in the past stems of 6b and
6c: class 6b is composed entirely of verbs formed by the negative -na9ma
 (9.326), class 6c of verbs derived by na'wa, plural subject of transitive verbs
 (9.323).
36      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONS   Class 7: Both stems retain the root vowel. In contrast to class 1 through 6,
which add the simplex alternants of the suffixes having simplex, geminate, and
glottal forms (4.16), classes 7 and 8 take the geminate alternants. The present
and imperative with verbs of class 7 is -p\
   Class 8: Both stems retain the root vowel, which, however, undergoes
phonological changes unique to this class. Like 7, class 8 verbs append the
geminate alternants of the appropriate suffixes, but, in contrast to 7, their
present and imperative suffix is -?a.
   Class 9: Both stems retain the root vowel. This is the only class which takes
the glottal alternants of suffixes with simplex, geminate, and glottal allo-
morphs. Internal differences within class 9 are marked by the present or im-
perative suffix: 9a forms this inflection with -ye, 9b with -0, and 9c with -e.
   Class 10: Unlike other verbs, those of class 10 possess only one stem, which
is morphologically restricted. These verbs cannot be inflected directly but must
first undergo derivational changes. The class 10a verb may either be redupli-
cated (9.34), thus becoming a verb of class 1, or add the punctiliar - ?? a
 (9.3214), which produces a 10b verb. Neither of these derivations is available
to class 10b verbs, which, however, can take such derivational suffixes as the
inchoative or inceptive -ti (9.3222), the causative -k9a (9.323), or the static
-nna (9.3241).
   9.2. Inflections of the Verb. Each of the inflectional suffixes of the Zuni
verb system will be described by 1) listing its allomorphs, 2) assigning the
allomorphs to their appropriate verb classes, 3) indicating the stem to which
the morpheme is added, 4) identifying the meaning category of the morpheme,
and 5) giving examples.
   9.21. Tense and Tense-Mode. The past (9.211) is the sole inflection ex-
pressing a pure tense; the other tense inflections have a mixed tense-mode refer-
ence. One of these suffixes denotes either the present tense or the imperative
mode (9.212). A past conditional (9.214) contrasts in function with a nonpast
conditional, the latter also having a future tense meaning (9.213). A distinct
suffix is used for the negative future tense or negative nonpast conditional
 (9.215), though other negative tenses or tense-modes are formed with a nega-
tive derivation (9.3213, 9.326) plus a tense or tense-mode inflection.
   Just as the past conditional (9.214) in its form is a transparently composite
suffix, containing the nonpast conditional plus -nka, so the negative past
conditional (9.216) is composed of the negative nonpait conditional form plus
»vka. The use of composite suffix forms is a rare phenomenon in Zuni, limited
to these two past conditional morphemes.

attached to the past stem, negative future tense or negative nonpast con-

   9.216. A composite suffix, made up of -?ka added to the negative future

expresses the negative past conditional.
   kwa? torn ho9 9itok9a-ssukwa-?ka I would not have fed you (if I hadn't had
plenty of food): ^itok^a (class 7) to cause to eat, to feed.
   kwa9 piya-^suk^-^ka he would not have been hanged (if he hadn't tried
to escape): piya (class 9a) to be hanging.
   9.22. Mode. Zuni has only two purely modal suffixes among its inflectional
elements. One of these is the hortatory (9.221), somewhat akin in function
to the imperative (9.212): the hortatory verb, which occurs without a subject
noun or pronoun, expresses a command to the person spoken to or makes
a more inclusive request, often translated as let's do so-and-so. The permissive
 (9.222) is accompanied in the sentence by an overt subject; with a second
person subject it indicates a polite command; with a first or third person
subject it expresses a request or makes a petition.
  9.221. -se (with classes 1-6), -sle (with 7-8), -9Xe (with 9), suffixed to the
past stem, hortatory.

  ^ota-^se let's dance: ?ota (class 9a) to dance.
   9.222. -tu (with classes 1-6), -ttu (with 7-8), -?tu (with 9), added to the
past stem, permissive.
   k^eccannissi to9 V-tu may you go with joy (a formal greeting): V n

   h o W w a n to9 ta'lak9 teya-9tu may you he our son-in-law: teya (class 9a)
to be.
   9.23. Subordination. Half of the inflectional morphemes of the verbs are
subordinating suffixes. Two of these define the relationship between the sub-
ject of the main verb and that of the subordinate verb: one (9.231) indicates
that the subordinate verb has a distinct subject, the other (9.232) that it has
the same subject as that of the following verb, which is usually the main verb.
Another suffix produces subordinates which function as modifiers of sub-
stantives or predicates (9.233). The contemporaneous subordinate (9.234)
indicates a continuous event which accompanies that of the main verb. A
verb denoting the goal or purpose of the main verb is marked by the resulta-
tive subordinate (9.235), and a verb modifying the main verb is formed by the
adverbial subordinate (9.236). Another suffix (9.237) has the limited func-
tion of forming a subordinate which, when used before the independent word
9
 ona, refers to the agentive. Finally, another subordinating inflection pro-
duces an agentive which is specifically located in the past (9.238).
   9.231. -?appa (with classes 1-2, 9), -appa (with 3), -ppa (with 4-8), added
to the present stem, subordinate with a subject distinct from that of the fol-
lowing verb. The syntactic function of this suffix is to form the verb of a
dependent clause (15.21). As a result of sandhi this suffix loses its final -pa
in most of its occurrences (5.2), though the full form often appears in
prayers.
   lesn hot ^ay-^ap summ ?uwenn 9okwika when he (Woodpecker) was still on

  9.232. -nan (with classes l-6a, 7-8), suffixed to the past stem, and -n (with
6b-6c, 9), sufiixed to the present stem, subordinate with the same subject as
that of the following verb. Like the preceding suflix (9.231), this subordi-
nator produces the verb of a dependent clause (15.21).

   9.233. -n (with classes 1-8), -? (with 9), added to the past stem, adjunctive
subordinate. Verbs with this morpheme modify substantives or predicates; as
predicate modifiers they may function as adverbials or as complements.

   9.3. Verb-Forming Derivations. Whereas all inflections are formed by word-
final suffixes, derivations are scattered over a variety of structural processes. A
few derivations of the verb are assigned to five prefix positions. The heaviest
load of verb-forming derivation is carried by the suffixes, arranged into six
relative positions preceding the final inflectional elements. Other derivational
morphemes change the internal constitution of the root, but these are limited
in their scope: there are two reduplicatives with aspectual functions; some
dozen suppletive verb forms, expressing the plural subject of intransitive
verbs, reflect the same voice function as that indicated by one of the prefixes.
  The following cross-referenced list will provide a summary of verb-forming
derivations, classified by functional categories.
  Number:
     plural subject of intransitive verbs (9.3111)
     plural subject of intransitive or plural object of transitive verbs (9.3152)
     plural subject of transitive verbs (9.325)
    Voice:
     causative (9.323)
     indirective (9.313)
      reciprocal (9.3151)
      reflexive (9.314)
    Aspect:
      continuative (9.3242)
      inchoative or inceptive (9.3113, 9.3222, 9.33)

   9.31. Prefixes. The prefixing derivations will be presented in terms of their
relative positions, starting with the first position adjacent to the stem. Several
of the prefixes have special allomorphs before a stem whose root begins in a
glottal stop which is zeroed (4.2).
   9.311. Three prefixes are mutually exclusive in the first position.
  9.3111. tet- (before t), t- (before the zeroed ? ) , te- (before other con-
sonants) , plural subject of intransitive verbs.
  tet-toma#yo?anna they will forget: toma'yo (class 1) to forget.
  ko9 ""Vy-an-t-ik^a they are saying (insulting) things to each other: ?i'y-
reciprocal, an- indirective, ?ikwa (class 7) to say.
  •H-te-powahka they untied themselves: ?i- reflexive, powaha (class 6a) to
untie.
  9.3112. te- terrestrial. This prefix frequently has reference to the ground,
but it may indicate other natural phenomena, such as the sky or the air.
  te-sikti rake the ground: sikti (class 4a) to scratch.
  te-saka the dirt is loosened (i.e., not tightly packed): saka (class 9b) to be
loose, to be soft in consistency.
  teJupc^innaye the sky is yellow: tupc^inna (class 9a) to be yellow.
  te-k?ati the weather is hot: k9ati (class 6a) to be hot.
  9.3113. y- (before the zeroed v ) , 9i- (before other consonants), inchoative
or inceptive.
  y-alo9ka it got roasted; ?alo (class 9a) to be roasted.
  kws? y-ona?ma it did not start to get formed (in the mold): ^ona^ma (class
6b) not to be made.
  v
   i-hasina9ka it became tighter: hasina (class 9b) to be tight.
   9.312. The sole prefix of the second position is yu- indeterminate. Most
frequently this prefix gives the verb the semantic force of an approximation,
generally translated as sort of or slightly. Sometimes it results in a derived
verb with a specialized meaning, as in yu-9assela to be envious < ^assela
to be askew, to be crooked (as a picture on the wall).
   torn s ^i-yu-te^cik^anan homat?an ^icu'nan s ?alka after tiring himself out,
he lay down under a juniper tree and went to sleep: ?i- reflexive, te^cik^a
 (class 7) to cause to arrive.
   yu-?ik?ohati it is getting sort of whitish: ?ik?ohati (class 4a) to become
white.

hot.
  yu-sikwinne a person with a frozen smile: sikwi (class 9a) to laugh, to smile.
    9.313. The third position is filled by the indirective prefix, which either
deflects the action of a transitive verb to another object or transitivizes an
intransitive verb. It is formally unique in having a number of assimilated
allomorphs (4.11): ?ah- (before h), 9al- (before 1), ?am- (before m, p),
?
 aw- (before w), •'ay- (before y), 9an- (before other consonants).
    ?
     ah-heyeka he defecated on it: heye (class 4b) to defecate.

prefix morphemes.
   9.3151. 9i#w- (before the zeroed 9 followed by i), ?i#y- (before the zeroed
'* followed by other vowels), 9i#- (before other consonants), reciprocal.

   ^i'w-ipiya^u shake hands with one another; ^ipiya^u (class 5) to shake the
hand of, literally to cause oneself to hold the hand of.
   ?
    ry-ay-ye'la?se let's have a race with each other: ay- indirective, ye'la (class
9a) to run.
   9.3152. Several morphologically determined sets of allomorphs participate
in forming the plural subject of intransitives or the plural object of transitives.
Suppletion performs this function for a few verbs (9.35). Only two verbs,
kwato (class 4a) to enter and kwayi (class 4a) to emerge, are pluralized by
the prefix 9ukw-. The two other pluralizing prefixes of the fifth position are
?
 a'w- (before the zeroed 9 ) , 9a'- (before other consonants), which occurs
with the great majority of verbs, and the more restricted y- (before the
zeroed 9 ) , ^i- (before other consonants).
   si 9ana vukw-kwayise oh no, let's go out: kwayi (class 4a) to go out.
   tapa* nisapak ""V-la^hip s yam tenan ?akk?akka when the mourning doves
flew up with a flapping noise, he lost his song: la9hi (class 4a) to fly.

   ho9n •'i-hakk^akka he requested us to do it: hakk?a (class 7) to request.
   9.32. Suffixes. Derivations which form verbs from nonverbs are few in
number. Only one verbalizing morpheme is suffixed to particles (9.3211).
A group of collective suffixes, comprising a formally and functionally uni-
form set of derivations, is added primarily to nouns to convert them into
verbs (9.3212).
   Most of the verb-forming derivations are applied to verb stems. But the
two stem forms, the past and the present, are unequally represented in the
derivational formations. The present stem provides only a single positional
slot preceding the inflectional suffixes of the final position; the sole derivational
element assigned to this slot is one of the negative suffixes (9.3213). The re-
46      UNIVERSITY OF NBW MEXICO PUBLICATIONSmaining verb-forming suffixes are distributed in six positional slots after the
past stem.
   As in describing the prefixes, the derivational suffixes will be treated in
terms of their positions, beginning with the position next to the stem.
Whereas* prefixes could be described without reference to the past or present
stem, these stems being determined by terminal derivations or inflections, the
description of each suffix must include reference to the type of stem which
it selects. Similarly, prefixes efiFected no change in the class membership of
the verb roots to which they were attached; but because each suffix forms a
verb of at given class, the resulting membership must be included as part of
the formal description of the suffix.
   Some of the derivational suffixes are highly productive and have been found
freely added to verbs of all classes; these offer no difficulties in description.
The unproductive suffixes, on the other hand, raise some problems. Being of
rare occurrence, they are generally found only with a few of the many verb
classes; it is impossible to determine, of course, whether this restriction of
occurrence is a patterned restriction in the distribution of these suffixes or
whether it merely reflects the limited sample of Zuni material which was
obtained. In any case, the description will include the distribution of each
suffix among the various verb classes to which it has been found attached. In
addition, some of the rare suffixes manifest anomalies of form, which will
also be indicated.
   9.321. Derivational verb-forming suffixes of the first position are added
either to particle stems (9.3211), to noun and particle stems (9.3212), to the
present stem of verbs (9.3213), or to the past stem of verbs (9.3214).
  9.3211. One suffix, -ma perceptive, is added to a few exclamative particles
to form verbs of class 2. The semantic force of the perceptive is to refer to
the perception or feeling associated with the meaning of the particle.
  ^a'w-ic^u-nia-ti-ka they were getting cold: ?a'w- plural subject of intransitive
verbs, vic?u (particle) exclamative in reaction to something cold, -ti inchoative,
-ka past.
  koci-m-?a he is being cautious: koci (particle) exclamative of pain, used
only by men, -?a present.
  ho^n -Vw^an-^elu-ma-nap-ka they enjoyed us: ?a'w- plural object of transitive
verbs, ?an- indirective, ?elu (particle) exclamative of pleasure, -nap plural
subject of transitive verbs, -ka past.
  9.3212. Verb-forming suffixes attached to noun and particle stems belong
to a fairly uniform type. The ten morphemes of this set are all first-position
suffixes. They follow a prevailing pattern of being appended to nouns,
                                                     ZUNI GRAMMAR            47though two of the ten suffixes are added to particles as well. They form roots
that are verbs of class 9a and nouns of class 1, though two of the ten suffixes,
Insofar as the field data show, seem to give rise solely to class 9a verbs. In
their semantic function these suffixes refer to some type of collectivity or
spacial arrangement of objects (or of a mass, which is generally treated in
Zuni as a plurality of objects), such as to be objects growing together on the
ground, to be objects on the surface, to be objects in a pile. The semantic
contrast between objects in a shallow container and those in a deep con-
tainer, occurring among some of these verb-forming derivatives (9.3212 b, f,
and i), is also found among noun-forming suffixes (10.321, 10.324).
  a) -la (with class 9a verbs and class 1 nouns) (to be) objects growing to-
gether on the ground (forms class 9a verbs and class 1 nouns).

   poZe-'t-^an V ^ u put it on the garbage pile: poce (noun class 1) garbage,
-van locative.
   9.3213. -9amme (with class 9 ) , -amme (with 6c), negative, is the only
derivation affiliated with the present stem of verbs; it forms verb roots of
class 9b. Another set of negative allomorphs, allocated to the remaining verb
classes, is suffixed to the sixth, or last, position of the past stem (9.326). The
•ingle positional slot of the present stem may be regarded, therefore, as
grammatically equivalent to the last positional slot of the past stem.
   As the following examples illustrate, the particle k w a 9 not or the negative
'^etta always occurs with negative verb forms.
   k w a ? his to 9 ?osokwkw-9amme-0 you are very foolish, literally you do not
have very much of a head: ^osok^l^i (class 9a) to have a head, -0 present.
   suski s k w a ? tuna'w-amme-9 tek w k w ant 9 as Vwallun ? allukka then eyeless
Coyote, the stupid fellow, went about feeling around with his hands: tuna'wa
 (class 6c) to have eyes, - ? adjunctive subordinate.
   9.3214. Only one suffix fits into the first position of the past stem: - w a
 (with class 10a), punctiliar (forms verbs of class 10b). All class 10a verbs
must add this derivational element. Next, as verbs of class 10b, they must be
derived by either the inchoative (9.3222, 9.33) or the static (9.3241) before
they can undergo inflection or further derivation.
   ho 9 9ic?iya-9?a-ti-ka I cut myself: ? ic 9 iya (class 10a) to cut oneself, -ti
inchoative, -ka past.
   to 9 *)ici'>*)a-na-0' you are lazy: 9 ici (class 10a) to be or become lazy, -na
static, -0 present.
  9.322. T o the second position of the past stem belong four aspect mor-
phemes: a repetitive appearing in several morphologically determined forms;
an inchoative or inceptive; and two conversive causatives, one a punctiliar and
the other a repetitive. The term ""conversive"" refers to the semantic function
of indicating the converse or opposite of the meaning contained in the root;
for example, the conversive causative of to be closed is to open.
   9.3221. The repetitive is one of the unproductive suffixes of Zuni. It occurs
in six apparently related forms, each selectively affiliated with a few verbs. A
phonological anomaly is the use of the prevocalic past stem with -co and -cela.
The forms and distribution of the repetitive are: -sle (with verbs of class 4b)
forms class 7 verbs; -co (with classes 4 and 6a) and -ceo (with classes 4b and
9a) form class 4b verbs; -ela (with class 4 ) , -cela (with class 4 ) , and -ttela
 (with classes 3b and 4a) form class 6a verbs. Of the repetitive allomorphs,
50       UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONS  -ela, -cela, and -co are attached to the prevocalic form of the past stem, the
  remaining allomorphs to the preconsonantal form.

   9.323. The third positional slot of the past stem is given over to the causa-
tive. The forms -k9a (with verbs of classes l-6a, 10b) and -kk?a (with
classes 7 and 9), forming class 7 verbs, are the most productive of the
causativizing derivations. Two other causatives have a more limited distri-
bution. One of these is -u (with class 9), which forms class 4a verbs. The
other is -9u (with class 9), which forms the unique class 5, containing only
verbs derived by this causative element. In class 5 verbs the full form -^u
appears only in the present stem (see Table 1, in 9.1); vocalic length is the
only manifestation of this suffix in the preconsonantal past stem; with the
zeroing of the final vowel in the prevocalic past stem, no overt mark of the
causative remains.

the fourth position of the past stem.
   9.3241. -na (with classes 1-7), -nna (with 10b), static. This derivational
suffix forms nouns of class 1 or verbs of either class 9a or 9b. Some examples
have been found in which the same static root may be used as a 9a or 9b
verb, with the 9a verb having a more specialized meaning: kw9inna-p' it is
black, k^inna-ye he is the clan Bow Priest (-0 is the present tense for 9b
verbs, -ye the present for 9a verbs): tetupc9inna-0 there is yellow on the
ground, telupc9inna-ye the sky is yellow.

allomorphs -ye* and -e' give rise to class 8a verbs, -y to class 8b. Verbs
formed by this continuative derivation are the sole members of class 8.

plural subject of transitive verbs, -e 9 present.
   yanhak-co-y-?a he is breathing: yanhaku (class 6a) to take a breath, -co
repetitive, - 9 a present.
    9.325. The fifth position of the past stem has only one derivational mor-
 pheme, the plural subject of transitive verbs: -na'wa (with classes l-6a, 7-8),
• (V) #wa (with 9) form verbs of class 6c, composed solely of these pluralized
verbs (Table 1, in 9.1); some class 9 verbs take -pa, another allomorph of
this derivational set, which forms verbs of class 6a. In the past stem the two
allomorphs, - (V) 'wa and -pa, fall together as -p: compare the past stems in
yala-p-ka they asked him and ^uli-p-ka they were worn by him with the present
stems in yata-'w-e ? they are asking him and ? uli-pa-0 they are worn by him.
A few verbs have developed alternative forms with the present stem based
on both of these allomorphs: ?una-*w-e9 or 9 una-pa-0 they see it, ?assu?wa-*w-e9
or ^assu^wa-pa-^ they are speaking to him.

   ^as ^uli-pa-nna he will wear gloves, literally they will be worn by him on
the hands: 9 uli (class 9a) to be worn by, -nna future.
   9.326. The sole morpheme assigned to the sixth position of the past stem
is the negative -na^ma (with classes l-6a, 7-8), producing verbs of the unique
class 6b (Table 1, in 9.1). The negative of classes 6c and 9 is formed by
- 9 amme, -amme (9.3213), added to the present stem. One of the negative
particles, k w a ? or ? efla, is always found with a verb containing a negative
suffix.

with the same subject as that of the following verb.
  kwa9 cum hoi ko9 kwa-nam-ka nobody said anything: kwa (class 7) to say,

   9.33. Discontinuous Affixes. To form the inchoative or inceptive, most
verbs add either the prefix (9.3113) or the suffix (9.3222) which express this
function. A few verbs of class 9b, however, require both affixes, resulting in
y- . . . -ti (before the zeroed ? ) , ?i- . . . -ti (before other consonants) for
the inchoative or inceptive; this prefix-suffix combination forms verbs of class
4a, as does the -ti suffix alone.

colored, -0 present.
   ^i-poca-ti-ka it got bad: poca (class 9b) to be bad, -ka past.
  9.34. Reduplicatives. Only verbs of class 10a undergo reduplication. Two
reduplicative patterns, both resulting in verbs of class 1, are applied to class
10a roots composed of two syllables. Some class 1 verbs have the form and
meaning of these reduplicatives, but the class 10a verbs from which they were
presumably derived can no longer be elicited: e.g., <?ikc?i to make irregular
wheezing and coughing noises, ^oy^o to make weeping sounds, c^ilili to make
wheezing noises in breathing, ?owowo to laugh boisterously; but these class 1
verbs have no underlying class 10a verbs, such as * c9ili, * ?oyo, or * ?owo,
which are productive at the present time.
  9.341. The formula 12312 indicates the reduplicative morpheme expressing
a mediopassive repetitive function. It affects four-phoneme roots of class 10a
and forms verbs of class 1.
  colco-^a it makes irregular crackling sounds (as in shaking a paper bag with
candy in it): colo (class 10a) to make the sound of crinkling paper, -9a

singular.
   hec?uc?u-k?a-0 massage it: htc?\x (class 10a) to squeeze, -k?a causative, -0
imperative.
  9.35. Suppletives. A few verbs have a lexical meaning which parallels the
grammatical meaning of the derivational prefix (9.3152) referring to the
plural subject of intransitives or the plural object of transitives. The follow-
ing is a list of singular and plural verb roots.
  to sleep: ?ala (singular subject), ya'tela (plural subject)
  to be standing: vela (singular subject), luwa (plural subject)
  to be in a sitting position: ?imo (singular subject), tina (plural subject)
  to be in a lying position: cuwa (singular subject), wo?yo (plural subject)
  to take: ^ahha (singular object), wo'tiha (plural object)
  to kill: 9ayna (singular object), lata (plural object)
  to hold: ieya, (singular object), woppona (plural object)
10. THE NOUN
   10.1. Noun Classes. The entire structural system of the noun is considerably
simpler than that of the verb. Noun classes are differentiated solely by means
of the two inflectional suffixes of the noun, singular and plural. The classes
of the noun, with their inflectional forms, are presented in Table 2.
   Of the three noun classes, 1 contains both basic and derived roots (8.1), 2
only basic monosyllabic roots, and 3 only derived roots formed by -la (10.321)
objects in a shallow container or -pa (10.324) objects in a deep container.
Basic noun roots are unevenly divided between classes 1 and 2: a sampling
of dictionary entries reveals that about 95 per cent of basic nouns belong to
class 1, with class 2 possessing the remainder. Qass 1, therefore, is a large
and productive class, containing not only the greatest proportion of basic
roots but also roots formed by a number of derivations. In contrast, class 2
has a relatively small membership of nouns; and class 3 is limited to two
derivations for its members.
   A few nouns of dais 1, referring to masses or abstracts, occur in the plural
form only. Some of these are bask roots i lcVwev water, luho-'we9 dust,
55      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONScema-'we^ thoughts. Among the derived plurals are some nouns apparently
related to other types of roots by derivations no longer productive: ?ohe-*we?
brains, marrow (9oha, a particle meaning medulla), yose-'we9 a lie (yose*, a
particle meaning unsuccessful attempt), ^ici^a-'we9 laziness (?ici, a class 10a
verb meaning to be or become lazy, -""a punctiliar).
   10.2. Inflections of the Noun. Only two inflections, a singular and a plural,
are suffixed to nouns. In addition to the full forms of the number sufiixes
 (10.21-10.22), special short forms may be used for monosyllabic stems which
function as head terms in syntactic constructions (10.23).","[35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]"
"    15.42. Number Concord. A singular subject or object is expressed by a
singular noun or pronoun in agreement with its predicate verb, the verb being
singular in lacking a plural subject or object affix. For the plural, the noun
or pronoun takes the plural inflection, and plurality is again indicated in the
verb.
   yam ca-^le9 ho 9 ?otenna J will make my child dance: - 9 le 9 singular with ca
 (noun class 1) child.
   yam ca-we9 ho 9 9a'w-otenna / will make my children dance: -we9 plural,
9 #
 a w- plural object.
   hon 9a'w-ote*-nap-ka we made them dance: -nap plural subject.
   The singular form of a noun, when used with a verb containing a plural
morpheme, denotes the dual.
   pasi-n k9apa the sleeve is wide: -n < -nne singular with pasi (noun class 1)
sleeve.
   pasi-n 9a'-k9apa the sleeves (dual) are wide: 9 a'- plural subject. The only
distinctively marked dual form in Zuni is the third person pronoun (Table 3,
in 11). For other pronouns the dual is expressed by the undifferentiated dual-
plural form in conjunction with a singular verb.
   ho9n ? unaye he sees us (dual): ho 9 n < ho 9 na 9 us (dual or plural).
   ho9n 9a'w-unaye he sees us (plural): 9a'w- plural object.
    15.5. Order of Components. In complex sentences the independent clause
is always the final clause. In any type of clause the verb is always the terminal
word. It is axiomatic, then, that an object complement precedes its verb.
Following the same sequence, a complement in an expanded substantive always
precedes its governing substantival term (15.222).
   N o other components manifest such fixity of order, but certain dominant
positional patterns can be described. Particles which function as clause modi-
fiers or predicate modifiers are generally placed at the beginning of the clause.
   cim s k w a ? ho 9 9 okk ? assuk w a (now then not I will-forget-it) now, then, I
will not forget it.
   ta* s 9 imat 9 an tena'ka (again then it-seems for-him sang) then he sang
for him again, it seems.
  Modifiers of substantives show considerable variability of position. But
there is some tendency for modifying particles and personal pronouns to
precede their governing substantive, and for modifying nouns and verbs to
follow it.
                                                  ZUNI GRAMMAR           73   hiS tenan co^yA^a very pretty song: his (particle) very, -? adjunctive sub-
ordinate with co?ya (verb class 9b) to be pretty.
   torn tuna* ^iiuwahanna your eyes will run away: torn (pronoun) your.
   ^3? walolo-nne (mica shiny) glass: -nne singular with walolo (noun class 1)
shiny (object).
   However, a modifier may be separated from its governing substantive by
intervening words which are not part of the substantive construction.
   torn ^an ho? tuna* ?itonna (your of I eyes will-eat) I wilt eat your eyes.
   am s yam ta* k?akwkwin ?ituna*ka (now then oneys-own [i.e., his] again
to-house directed-himself) now he directed himself toward his house again.
   When a clause contains both a subject and an object, the subject usually
precedes.
   ta'cis tarn tununu susk ^ank^ohak^anan . . . (meanwhile wood rumbler
{i.e., woodpecker] coyote perceiving) meanwhile, when Woodpecker per-
ceived Coyote . . . .
   ta* s ?imat suski yam tuna* ?ituwahk?ap . . . (again then it-seems coyote
one's-own [i.e., his] eyes causing-to-run-away) then, after Coyote perhaps
made his eyes run away again . . . .
   ta* hxp yam papa* suw hoi tena'n hakk^anna (again I oneys-own [i.e., my]
otder-brother-or younger-brother perhaps sing will-ask) perhaps I will ask my
older brother or younger brother to sing again.
   •Vc ho?n ?ayyuci9atika (they-two us were-amazed-at) they (dual) were
amazed at us (dual).
   The common sequence in a clause, then, is: 1) clause and predicate modi-
fiers in the form of particles, 2) subject substantive, 3) object substantive,
and 4) verb complex of predicate. In a close-knit predicate construction, modi-
fiers and complements immediately precede their governing verb; otherwise,
they may appear earlier in the clause (13.211-15.212). Within a substantive
the usual order is for complements and modifying particles or pronouns to
precede their governing term, for other modifiers to follow it.

4. PHONEMIC CHANGES IN MORPHEME SEQUENCES  Two types of phonemic changes are associated with affixation: 1) affixes
occur in a number of patterned sets of alternants; 2) affixes induce phonemic
changes in neighboring morphemes. In addition to these changes, a stem under-
goes abbreviations when it appears in thefirst-positionslot of a compound.
   4.1. Patterns of Affix Alternants. Characteristically, the Zuni affix is a
morpheme having a set of differentiated forms. With some affixes, phono-
logical conditions can be adduced for the morpheme alternants. But each of
these conditioning factors, such as consonant assimilation, has a limited ap-
plication to one or a few affixes. Unlike the changes discussed in the pre-
ceding section (3), no phonological rationale applies universally throughout
22      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONSthe affix system. With most affixes the alternants are distributed in accord-
ance with strictly morphological criteria and display no discernible phono-
logical basis.
   The patterns of affix alternants represent an intricately fragmented system.
The very multiplicity of these patterns, some with a phonological and others
with a morphological basis of distribution, is one indication of the loose and
unintegrated nature of the morphophonemics of Zuni affixes. Furthermore,
some of the alternant patterns overlap: one aiBx set of three allomorphs shows
a partial resemblance to another set containing two alternants (4.16 and 4.17).
Finally, an affix which possesses some allomorphs belonging to one definable
pattern may have additional allomorphs which belong to another pattern or
which, being merely suppletive, cannot be assigned to any of the recurrent
patterns (4.14). In spite of their fragmented character, certain formal pat-
terns of affix differentiation emerge with sufficient clarity to merit description.
For each affix treated in the following paragraphs dealing with alternant sets,
reference will be made to a later section where more examples are presented
and the relevant morphological details are described.
  4.11. Consonant-Assimilated Alternants. The final consonant of the in-
directive prefix (9.313) is assimilated to the initial consonant of the stem.
The alternant forms are ?ah- before h, 9al- before 1, ?am- before m or p, ?aw-
before w, ?ay- before y, and 9an- before all other consonants; the prefix does
not appear before vowels.
   4.12. Vocalic-Consonantic Alternants. Several prefixes occur in paired forms:
one of the allomorphs ends in a vowel and is attached to stems whose roots
begin in a consonant other than the glottal stop; the other prefix form, ending
in a consonant, is added to vowel-beginning stems derived from roots whose
initial glottal stop has been zeroed. One suffix and two enclitics have alternants
with a somewhat similar rationale of distribution.
   One of the prefixes indicating plurality—the plural of particles referring
to persons, the plural subject of intransitive verbs or the plural object of
transitive verbs (9.3152, 12.21)—has the form V - before consonants other
than ? and ?a*w- before vowel-beginning stems which have dropped the root-
initial ? : V-hotta grandmothers, granddaughters (hotta grandmother, grand-
daughter), V-la?hika they jumped (la?hika he jumped), Vw-occi males
 pocci male), ?a""w-an?elum?a he likes them (?anpelum?a he likes it).
   Three prefix morphemes have the shape 9i- before consonants other than ?
and y- before the zeroed 9 of the root. One of these morphemes is a plural
prefix attached to verbs (9.3152): ?i-tapka he bought them; y-aleka they died
 (?aseka he died). Another is the reflexive (9.314): 9i-piya'kft he hanged him-
                                                       ZUNI GRAMMAR              23 self, y-apc?ika he cut himself (?apc?ika he cut it). The same pair of forms
 mdicates the inchoative (9.3113): ?i-pottiye it is getting full, y-oka it became
  (?oka it was made).
     A similar rationale of allomorphic distribution applies to two morphemes,
 each of which occurs in three prefixal forms. The reciprocal (9.3151) appears
 as ?i*- before consonants other than ?, 9i#w- before the zeroed ? when the first
 vowel of the stem is i, and ?i'y- before the zeroed ? when the first stem vowel
 is other than i: ?i*-hannil9a they like each other, ^i'w-ihto^u tie them together
  (?ihto?u tie another piece to it), ?ry-amahcinapka they laughed at one another
  (?amahcinapka they laughed at it). A plural prefix (9.311) has the form te-
before consonants other than t or ? , tet- before t, and t- before the zeroed ? :
 te-cuneka they stopped, tet-tunati open your (plural) eyes, t-ikwakka they said
  (?ikwakka he said).
    One suffix exhibits a similar pattern of allomorphic distribution, but addi-
tional phonological idiosyncracies are involved. The continuative (9.3242)
takes the form -e* after consonant-ending stems of polysyllabic roots whose
final e or a vowel has been zeroed; the allomorph -y is added to vowel-ending
items of polysyllabic roots with a final i, o, or u, this vowel not being zeroed
before the continuative; and the allomorph -ye* is suffixed to the vowel-ending
•tern of monosyllabic roots, whose vowel is never zeroed. In summary, then,
a stem ending in a consonant takes a form of the continuative suffix beginning
In a vowel; stems ending in a vowel take one of the suffixes beginning in a
consonant. Examples are: ?ikw-e*-?a he is saying ( < ? ik w a to say), 9ito-y-;>a he
is eating ( < ?ito to eat), kvo-ye*-?a he is crying (<k ? on to make weeping
noises).
    Two enclitics appear in paired forms which are differentiated for consonant-
ending as against vowel-ending stems. The interrogative (13.1) is -si after
consonants, -?si after vowels, and the similarly patterned adversitive (13.2)
occurs as -te after consonants, -?te after vowels: tenekkan-si ? a'ka did he go
there to sing? ?aliye-?si is it nice? yute?cinan-te even though he's tired,
^uZXupa-^te he's just wearing the shirt.
   4.13. Alternants Differentiated for Monosyllabic and Polysyllabic Roots.
The continuative suffix described in the preceding section (4.12) has distinc-
tive allomorphs not only for vowel-ending versus consonant-ending verbs but
alio for monosyllabic versus polysyllabic verbs. The latter pattern, differen-
tiating alternants on the basis of the syllabic content of roots, applies more
extensively to the morphophonemics of nouns than verbs.
   The forms of the singular suffix (10.21) arc -ple9 with monosyllabic nouns
uf class 1 and -mmev with class 2 nouns (Table 2), all of which art mono-
24      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONSsyllabic: ti-9le9 sinew, kVmme 9 stalk. The singular forms associated with
polysyllabic nouns are -nne with class 1 and -9e with class 3, the latter con-
taining only polysyllabic noun roots: homa-nne juniper leaf, sap-?e ( < sapa)
a box of dishes.
   The same rationale differentiates the alternants of the plural suffix (10.22).
The form -we9 is added to monosyllabic nouns of class 1 and to class 2:
K-we? sinews, kVwe 9 stalks. For polysyllabic nouns the plural is -(V)*we?:
homa-'we9 juniper leaves, sapa-'we9 boxes of dishes.
   4.14. ?a-a-0 Alternants. Four of the suffixes added to verbs appear in the
following triplicate forms.
   -?appa, -appa, -ppa, subordinate with a subject distinct from that of the
following verb (9.231): sole-?appa after it swells, k?on-appa when he wept,
ho9 ?okwi-ppa when I awoke.
   -?anna, -anna, -nna, future tense or nonpast conditional (9.213): ^ose-^anna
he will be hungry, to9 yu^ya'w-anna you will know about it, 9allu-nna he
would move about (if he got well).
   -•'an, -an, -n, subordinate before ?ona, agentive (9.237): Vta-^an ? ona one
who is getting fat, ?iy-an 9ona one who is arriving, tene'-n ? ona one who is
singing.
   -9a, -a, -0, present tense or imperative (9.212): tasa-?a it is growing,
hatiya'w-a listen!, ho9 k?eccana-0 I am happy.
   The three forms of each suffix are distributed in accordance with verb-
class categories. The basis of distribution is entirely morphological; the verb
classes have no phonological characteristics that could determine the selection
of suffix alternants.
   Although a consistent pattern of form is displayed in the three allomorphic
types illustrated above, the suffixes manifest a number of inconsistencies. The
distribution of the three alternants among verb classes is not entirely sym-
metrical. The ?a-type, for example, is always attached to class 1 verbs, but it
has an overlapping distribution as follows: -?appa is suffixed to verb classes 1,
2, and 9: -?anna, to classes 1 and 2; -?an, to class 1; and -9a, to classes 1, 2,
and 8. Furthermore, most of these suffixes include additional allomorphs which
do not conform to the alternant configuration: the future tense or nonpast
conditional occurs as -?anna, -anna, -nna with stems of only some of the verb
classes and as -uwa, -a, -k^anna with the remaining verb classes; the subordi-
nate -?an, -an, -n includes a form -0 with certain verb classes; the present
tense or imperative, in addition to the alternants -?a, -a, -0 affiliated with some
verb classes, appears as -e9, -e, -ye with other verb classes. Only the subordi-
nate suffix indicating a distinct subject has no allomorphi besides -?appa,
-appa, -ppa.
                                                       ZUNI GRAMMAR             25   4.15. V d Alternants. Partially parallel to the forms of the preceding type
are the following two-alternant morphemes.
   -?amme, -amme, negative (9.3213): kwa? silow-?amme it is not red, kwa?
tuna'w-amme he is without eyes.
   -9an, -an, locative enclitic (13.4): ?akwkw-?an ?a??uka he laid it by the ditch,
tatta'w-an by the trees.
   ?
    annan, -annan, inessive enclitic (13.5): k9ol-9annan (mixed) in the chile,
te^l-annan inside the pot.
   Like the 9a-a-0 pattern discussed above (4.14), these alternants are dis-
tributed on a morphological rationale, and their distributional affiliations are
not uniform. One of the morphemes, the inessive, has a third allomorph, -nan,
in addition to the forms in the two-alternant pattern.
   4.16. Simplex-Geminate-Glottal Alternants. Six suffixes attached to verb
stems have a pattern of three alternants with the form -CV . . . , -CCV
. . . ,- p CV . . . .
   -ka, -kka, -pka, past tense (9.211): wakti-ka he gouged the ground, pokli-kka
he was smoking, k?oksi-9ka it was good.
   -kan, -kkan, -9kan, resultative subordinate (9.235): ?isema-kan Vne he
will go to call them, tun 9allu-kkan Vkowa one who went to look around,
loli-^kan ?ika he came to play cards.
   -kowa9, -kkowa9, -?kowav, past agentive subordinate (9.238): ?alim-kowa9
the one he liked, pokti-kkowa9 one who was smoking, teya-?kowa that which
used to be.
   4e, -sse, -?se, hortatory (9.221): tena'-se let's sing, 9ayna-sse let's kill it,
^alXu'Va-^se let's speak to him.
   -Xukwa, -ssukwa, -9sukwa, negative future tense or negative nonpast con-
ditional (9.215): kwa* ?ase-sukwa he will not die, kwa? k?oso-ssukwa (tell her
to that) she should not be washing it, kwa? k9oksi-?sukwa (if it isn't done
tight) it won't be good.
   •tu, -ttu, -?tu, permissive (9.222): ?et to9 kwayik9anam-tu don't let him go
out, ho9 9ayna-ttu let me kilt it, ta""lak9 teya-9tu (may you) be our son-in-law.
   This set of morphemes is completely symmetrical in form and in morpho-
logical distribution. None of the morphemes has other allomorphs in addition
to the three forms. In distribution the simplex form of these suffixes is affiliated
with items of verb classes 1 through 6, the geminate form with classes 7 and
A, and the glottal form with class 9.
  4.17. Simplex-Geminatt Alternants. In the following suffixes the pattern of
two alternants partially resembles the triplicate pattern presented in the pre-
ceding section (4.16).
26          UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONS   -co, -ceo, repetitive (9.3221): ? ipak-co throw it several times, we ? a-cco yell
 (Le., make repeated         shouts).
   -k ? a, -kk 9 a, causative ( 9 . 3 2 3 ) : 9 ito-k 9 a feed him (i.e., cause him to eat),
to^o-kk^a tighten it.
   -na, -nna, static (9.3241): tesla-na he is afraid, k 9 oha-nna it is white.
   -nissP, -nnissi 9 , adverbial subordinate ( 9 . 2 3 6 ) : tesla-nissi 9 peka he spoke
fearfully, k^ecca-nnisS? to ? a*tu may you go happily.
   Only the two alternants, as listed above, are found for each of the suffixes.
But the alternants d o not exhibit a symmetrical distribution among verb
classes, although their distribution is somewhat similar to that of the preced-
ing set ( 4 . 1 6 ) : thus, the simplex -k ? a is suffixed to stems of classes 1 through
6; and the geminate form -kk^a occurs with classes 7 through 9, a distribution
which overlaps that of the geminate and glottal alternants in the previously
discussed pattern (4.16). T h e more complex distributional details of the other
morphemes in this group will be described in their appropriate morphological
sections.                                                                                              ••-;£] •'
                                                                                                        •   .   .   j    4.2. Changes Induced by Affixes. Besides exhibiting sets of differentiated
forms, affixes may also effect changes in neighboring forms. These induced
changes are of two types: 1) zeroing of root-initial glottal stop, with certain
prefixes; 2) lengthening of root-final vowel, with certain suffixes. Both changes
are morphologically conditioned.
    T h e initial glottal stop of roots is zeroed after the plural prefixes (9.3111,
9.3152, 12.21), the inchoative (9.3113), the reflexive (9.314), and the re-
ciprocal (9.3151). (Examples illustrating the morphophonemics of these pre-
fixes are presented in 4.12.) Other prefixes, however, d o not have this reduc-
tion effect. T h e indeterminate yu- (9.312), for example, appears before all root
consonants, including the glottal stop: yu-seina he's full of food, yu- ? asenanne
it's greenish.
    A few suffixes lengthen the final vowel of the root, an effect indicated by
the symbol (V) • with a vowel-lengthening suffix: - (V) * contemporaneous sub-
ordinate ( 9 . 2 3 4 ) , - ( V ) ' a l t e r n a t i v e ( 1 2 . 2 2 1 3 ) , - ( V ) * k w e agentive (12.2224),
- ( V ) ' t i to be a pile of (9.3212j), ( V ) ' w a plural subject of transitive verbs
 (9.325), and - ( V J ' w e 9 plural of nouns (10.22). A n example o f the latter
is homata-'we 9 juniper trees but homata-nne juniper tree.
    4.3. Abbreviated         Stems in Compounds. W h e n they occur as first-position
stems in compounds ( 8 . 8 ) , roots of more than one syllable are abbreviated
to their initial C V : tu-mok w k w 9 a-nne stocking is composed of tu-, an abbre-
viated stem of tukni toe, added to m o k w k w 9 a shoe and the singular suffix
-nne; me-k^ififo negro contains me-, abbreviated from melika Anglo,                                        White
                  wV
Man, plus k iHo black person.
                                                       ZUNI GRAMMAR             275. SANDHI: PHONEMIC CHANGES IN WORD SEQUENCES  Sandhi reduction affects only word-final phonemes, which are zeroed or
unvoiced in two types of environment: 1) utterance-final and 2) utterance-
medial.
   5.1. Reduction of Phonemes in Utterance-Final Position. A word-final n or
?
  is invariably zeroed when it appearsfinallyin the utterance: kalapakwin 9a'ka
he went to Gallup, but in answer to Where are you going? the response might
be kalapakwi to Gallup; siwe? ta'p . . . meat and . . . but siwe meat, when
pronounced in isolation.
   A word-final short vowel suffers a subphonemic reduction, that of unvoic-
ing, at the end of an utterance (1.4). This change is optional, though it oc-
curs with greater than fifty-percent frequency in my folktale texts and con-
versational material.
    5.2. Reduction of Phonemes in Utterance-Medial Position. In a word of
more than one syllable, the final -v or -v? is zeroed before another word be-
ginning in h or ? : ?a*ci they (dual) appears in its full form in 9a'ci ye'lahka
the two of them ran, in its reduced form in V c hi'nina they two are the same;
,(,
   assela? crookedly, leaning to one side occurs in its full form in ^assela9
powaye he is sitting crookedly, in its reduced form in 9assel ?elaye he is
standing crookedly. This type of reduction is automatic.
    Other types of reduction within the utterance are optional and, apparently,
depend on the style of speech. Frequently the second consonant of a cluster is
itself zeroed before a zeroed -v or -v7. This type of consonantal zeroing affects
a postconsonantal glottal stop or the second consonant in a geminate cluster:
the full form kwawwop?e a store is reduced in kwawwop (or kwawwop?) ?illi
he owns a store; the full form manikka underneath is reduced in manik (or
manikk) ^a^u put it underneath. When the consonant before a reduced -v or
•v9 is a continuant (m, n, 1, y, w), it is often reduced by unvoicing (1.3): the
m of ko?ma all right may be voiced or unvoiced in ko?m hxP pottutu all right,
Ut me fill it; similarly, the y of ccPya? pretty may be voiced or unvoiced in
horn ?an ^uccun co?y ?oka a pretty shirt was made for me.
   The reductions described above take place before an initial h or 9 of the
following word. Certain morphemes undergo the same types of reduction be-
fore any consonant, an environment which includes all utterance-medial condi-
tions, since every word begins in a consonant. The morphemes susceptible to
reduction before any consonant are high-frequency forms, such as common
particles or word-final suffixes which normally appear on words within the
body of an utterance. A particle such as tern! ttill, until can be elicited In its
28      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONS full form only by obtaining it in isolation from the informant; in context,
where it never occurs at the end of an utterance, it is invariably found in the
 form tern. The following are other particles with their reduced forms, which
always occur in context, and their full forms: 9alna9t < 9alna9te once more,
9 w
  ik att < 9ikwalte back, back again, 9imat < 9imati perhaps, 9ist < 9iste
there (near person spoken to), cim < cimi recently, hot < holi probably,
lakw or lakwkw < lakwkwa there (far from speaker), la'k or la'k9 < la'k9i
now, today, li'l < li'Ia here, s < si and, then, yam < yami oneys own. The
following word-final suffixes occur in their reduced forms before any con-
sonant: various allomorphs of the singular suffix on nouns, such as -91 < -9le9,
-n or -nn < -nne, -m or -mm < -mme9, -0 or -9 < -9e (10.21); allomorphs of
the noun plural, -w < -we9 and - (V) *w < - (V) 'we9 (10.22), the allomorphs
-9ap, -ap, -p < -9appa, -appa, -ppa, which form a subordinate verb with a
subject distinct from the main verb (9.231); the interrogational -9p, -p < -9pi,
-ppi, -pi (12.2216). Some examples of these suffixes in context are:
   his si-9l lo9o the piece of meat is very tough (si-9l < si-9le9 piece of meat);
   summ 9uwe-n s 9ikatika and that fellow Coyote became angry (9uwe-n <
9
  uwe-nne fellow);
    ho9 mu-w tihka I bought bread (mu-w < mu-we9 bread);
   ko-p ley-9ap kwa9 horn 9an to9 tena'na9ma what is happening that you aren't
singing for me? (ko-p < ko-ppi what?, ley-9ap < ley-9appa is happening).
The allomorphs of the future, -9anna, -anna, -nna, -k9anna (9.213), have their
full form in a main verb, which, being final in an utterance, does not undergo
this type of reduction. But these allomorphs always appear without the ter-
minal -na before all forms of the defective verb 9iyaha to intend to, to want
to: tena9u-nna he will sing but tena9u-n 9iha he intends to sing; 9ituwa-k9anna
they will stand up but 9iluwa-k9an tiha they want to stand up.","[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"

But the object and possessive pronouns have overlapping forms in the singular

they have no distinctive forms based on utterance position. But the possessives,
which are differentiated in the singular for medial as against final position,
can distinguish between the modifying function in utterance medial position,

utterances (15), where a pronoun may occur finally, as in homma (it's) mine.","[60, 61]"

11. THE PERSONAL PRONOUN
   As indicated in Table 3, Zuni has three pronouns of person, differentiated
for number (singular, dual, plural) and for case (subject, object, possessive).
The paradigm is too lacking In symmetry to permit one to identify the con-
stituent morphemes with any confidmrt, but the underlying roots of the three
persons appear to be * ho' first person, • to' second person, and * V third
person. The first and second |»rsons follow the same paradigmatic pattern,
60      UNIVBRSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONSbut the third person is distinctive. There are no subject pronouns for the
third person in the singular or the plural, and the third person objects are
employed only as emphatics. The third person subject, then, is indicated by
the absence of a pronoun, with the verb denoting the singular or plural num-
ber of the subject (9.3111, 9.3152, 9.325). The singular or plural third per-
son object, though it may be overtly expressed for emphasis, is more commonly
indicated in the same manner, i.e., by the number affix on the verb.","[59, 60]"

L DllTRIBUTION OF PHONEMES    Voweli occur lingly, always flanked by consonant! in any icquencc of
|tlumemes. Consonants may appear cither singly or In clusters, depending
16      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONSupon the position of the cluster in the syllable (2.1), upon the position of the
syllable in the word (2.2), and, for clusters which include the glottal stop,
upon the location of morpheme borders (2.4).
   2.1. Phoneme Sequences in Syllables. The structural range of syllables con-
taining C (consonant) and V (vowel) is indicated in the following typological
scheme.
                              A            B
                          1     CV          CCV
                          2     CVC         CCVC
                          3     CVCC        CCVCC
   Restrictions upon phoneme sequences can be most conveniently described
in terms of initial borders, nuclei, and final borders of syllables. When the
initial border of a syllable is a single consonant (types 1A, 2A, 3A), this
position may be filled by any consonant. When the initial border is a con-
sonant cluster (types IB, 2B, 3B), only k9, k™9, c9, or c9 may occupy this
position. When kw or k ^ forms the initial border, it must be followed by a
front or central vowel; these labiovelars, plain or glottalized, never precede o,
o% u, or u\
   When the vowel nucleus is terminal in the syllable or is followed by a single
consonant (types 1 A, IB, 2A, 2B), it may consist of any vowel, long or short.
When the nucleus is followed by a consonant cluster (types 3A, 3B), a long
vowel is found only before the cluster k9; a short vowel may precede any
consonant cluster.
   When the final border of a syllable is a single consonant (types 2A, 2B), it
may be filled by any consonant. When the final border is a cluster (types 3 A,
3B), the first member may be any consonant. But if the first consonant of a
final cluster is 1, kw, c, or c, it must be followed either by a glottal stop or
by an identical consonant to form a geminate cluster (2.3). When the first
member is any other consonant, however, there appear to be no limitations on
the second member of the final cluster.
   The following examples will illustrate the syllable types in monosyllabic
words or in the first syllables of longer words.
  CV: si then, ta* again
  CCV: k^alasi crow, k9o*si Joshua cactus
  CVC: ten in vain, ta'p and
  CCVC: k9usna it is dry, c V k ^ a t i it makes a liquidlike sucking sound
  CVCC: lesn thus, la'k9 today (sandhi-reduced formi of leina, la'k9i)
  CCVCC: k V tfokPamme it is not good, c9ikwkw9a on the skin
                                                      ZUNI GRAMMAR            17     2.2. Syllable Sequences in Words. Some of the syllable types are further
  restricted in the positions they may occupy within the word unit. Syllables can
 be classified in accordance with four patterns of permitted occurrence: 1)
  those limited to initial position in the word; 2) those limited to final position;
 3) those which may occur either finally in the word or nonfinally before a
 glottal stop; and 4) those which may fill any position.
     Syllables whose initial border contains a consonant cluster (types IB, 2B,
 3B) are limited to word-initial position; in this position, only k?, kw?, c?, or c?
 comprise the initial border, and their occurrence here is not paralleled by other
 clusters. When any of these four clusters occur word medially, however, they
must be interpreted as ambisyllabic, for in this position they are paralleled
 by other consonant clusters which can be analyzed only as ambisyllabic. Thus,
 W e large metate is analyzed syllabically as CVC-CV (not CV-CCV), be-
 cause it is structurally parallel to such forms as ^anse bear, V i e rock, or
 moPe spherical objects in a container. Similarly, makk^i woman with children
 Is interpreted as CVCC-CV (not CVC-CCV), for here it is equivalent in
•yllabic structure to lass^a he is getting old, 9akPa at the fire, or he?n?ap
 when it is glued. The distinctive phonemic status of k?, k^, <?, and £? is also
 reflected in the unique distribution of these clusters in morphemes (2.4).
    Syllables limited to word-final position have a long vowel as their nucleus
and a consonant cluster at their final border. The only examples appearing in
my data are monosyllabic words of type 3 A: ka'k9 sometime (sandhi-reduced
 form of ka*k9i).
    Syllables ending in a consonant cluster (types 3A, 3B) but, in contrast
to the preceding type, containing a short vowel as the nucleus may occur
•ither finally in the word or nonfinally before a syllable beginning with a
glottal stop: ?ikwValt back (sandhi-reduced form of ^ik^atte), c?itc?inne a
person who wheezes and coughs. The same limitations of occurrence apply to
•yllables ending in a single consonant (type 2A, 2B) and having a long-
vowel nucleus: 9 akVn (I asked him) to dig a hole, yuViPa he is grieving.
    Syllables ending in a single consonant (type 2A) preceded by a short
vowel and syllables ending in a vowel (type 1 A), whether long or short, are
positionally free; they may occur initially, medially, or finally before any
consonant.
    In their patterns of permitted occurrence, the syllabic structures may be
symbolized by using (C) for alternative consonantal phonemes (i.e., CCV (C)
Indicates CCV or CCVC), v for short vowel, v for long vowel, and v (•) for
long or short vowel.
    1) Syllables limited to word-initial position: CCv(C), CCV(C)(C).
    2) Syllables limited to word-final position: Cv(')CG
18      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONS  3) Syllables limited to either word-final position or to nonfinal position
before glottal stop: (C)CvCC, (C)CvC.
  4) Syllables which may occur in any word position: CvC, Cv(').
   2.3 Geminate Clusters of Consonants. Any consonant may occur in a
geminate cluster, pronounced with a slightly longer quantity than the single
consonant but with considerably less than a doubled duration. Examples are:
cippa it is coarse, citta mother, 9akka because, pacc9apa kinglet (bird species),
9
 uccunne shirt, 9itokwkwa to the right, ho""i he is alive, te9esse thud, 9ussa
bullsnake, 9etta no, 9ohho9li deer, 9ulle it is inside, kemme leather, 9innaye
it costs, kwawwopp9a at the store, poyye roadrunner. These identical clusters,
which are found with great frequency in Zuni words, are structured like other
CC clusters: Le., they may be ambisyllabic, as in cippa it is coarse, whose
syllable structure is CVC-CV; or they may comprise the final cluster of a
syllable, as in pacc9apa kinglet, which contains the syllables CVCC-CV-CV.
    2.4. Morphemic Status of Glottal Clusters. The unique status of k9, k^, c9,
 and c9, discussed above with reference to syllabic structure (2.2), is also
 manifested on the morphemic level. These are the only glottal clusters which
 are found within morpheme units. Any other cluster of consonant plus glottal
 stop is always split by a morpheme border.
    As morpheme-internal sequences k9 and c? occur frequently, k^9 is rather
 rare, and c9 is found in my data only as the initial in a half-dozen verb stems
 of a uniform semantic type, referring to liquidlike sounds: c^ak^a^ati it
 makes a splash, c^u'lr^ati it makes a squirting sound. In word-initial position
these four clusters are always morphemically internal, for they cannot be
 formed by any combination of morphemes. They are also unique in this posi-
tion; no other glottal cluster occurs word-initially. In word-medial position,
three of the clusters (k9, k™9, c9) may be found within morphemes, the
morpheme-internal c9 appearing, as noted above, only as a word-initial cluster:
lik9aya column of smoke, 9akw9a medicine, 9apc9i to cut are single morphemes.
All four of these glottal clusters, however, occur word-medially spanning a
morpheme border, which is indicated by a hyphen in the following examples:
susk-9a#wan of coyotes, k9akw-9an at the house, k9acc-9appa after it smelted
of cooked meat, kwa9 sopc-9amme don't be mischievous. Parallel to this
phenomenon, a cluster of any other consonant plus glottal stop may be
found, separated by a morphemic seam, in word-medial position: wop-9e
things in a tall container, tatt-9an at the tree, kwa9 kwih-9amme it is not
spilled, 9an-9elum-9a he likes it.
   On the basis of the unique status of the four glottal clusteri in the present
structure of Zuni, it is possible to make some historical Inferences. The oc-
                                                    ZUNI GRAMMAR            19I'urrence of these combinations within morphemes, both initially and medially,
gives them a close-knit, unitary character distinct from all other glottal
flusters, suggesting that they may have been unit phonemes at an earlier
lime. The rarity of morpheme-internal k ^ and <?, compared to the frequency
nf kw and c, further suggests a diminishing distribution for two of the four
unitary clusters. Finally, their adaptation to a pattern prevailing in modern
Zunl is shown in their word-medial occurrence, like all other glottal clusters,
Across morpheme boundaries.

                                              MORPHOPHONEMICS3. PHONEMIC CHANGES IN PHONEME SEQUENCES
  Phonemes may undergo change as their environments are altered through
the operation of morphological processes within word units. All such changes
are regressive, the environment exerting its influence upon preceding phonemes.
   3.1. Vowel Shortening. The only vocalic change consists in the shortening
of fundamentally long vowels, whose conditions of occurrence are limited. A
long vowel may occur word-finally; nonfinally it may be followed by a single
consonant or by a consonant cluster only if the second consonant of the clus-
ter is a glottal stop (2.2). A long vowel is consequently shortened when
morphological changes induce alterations in the following consonantal en-
vironment, wherein a long vowel is not permitted. Thus, in the penult of the
verb root ?itulla*pi go around, the long vowel is maintained throughout the
inflections in which it is followed by a single consonant: ?itulla'pinna he will
go around, ?itulla*pippa after he went around. But the long vowel is shortened
in the inflections of the consonant-ending stem 9itulla'p- when it is followed
by a morpheme beginning in a consonant other than the glottal stop: ^itullapka
he went around, ^itullapnan after going around. The verb root yu^a'so to
grieve will illustrate the maintenance of the long vowel when followed by a
single consonant or by a cluster whose second member is a glottal stop:
yu9a*soka he grieved, yu^a's^anna he will grieve.
   3.2. Replacement of kw by k- Of all consonants kw is the most restricted
in its possibilities of occurrence. It can be followed only by a front or central
vowel, a glottal stop, or another kw (2.1, 2.3). When these permitted en-
vironments are changed by morphological processes, a morphemically basic y
kw of the root is replaced by k in the stem. The replacement may result from
a change in the following vowel: lakwi-?ka it was inserted but tak-u-ka he
caused it to be inserted, where the stem * takw- ( < root takwi) is followed
by the -u causative. The change of kw to k takes place with the appearance
of a following back vowel, even though a word boundary and a glottal stop
intervene: ?ehkwi-?ka he was first but 9ehk ?ona one who is first. It should
be noted that the word boundary does not prevent a stop consonant and a
glottal itop from fusing into a phonetically globalized consonant (1.1).
                                                     ZUNI GRAMMAR            21   The kw is similarly replaced when it is followed by a consonant other than
k or 9 : ?ak-na it is ripe, containing -na static added to a stem of the root
  w'^a^a to become ripe; but sikw-9appa after he laughed, where -?appa, one of
the subordinating suffixes, is attached to a stem of the root sikwi to laugh.
Both consonants of the geminate cluster kwkw undergo replacement in en-
vironments that do not permit kw. In this double change, if the second member
of the cluster becomes k (e.g., because of a following back vowel), the first
member, which now precedes a consonant other than kw or 9 , must also be re-
placed by k: ?ikk-u-ka he wrapped it, in which the causative -u is sufiixed to
a stem of the root ?ikwkwi to be wrapped around.
   3.3. Replacement of I by I. The phoneme 1 may precede any vowel, but its
consonantal environment is limited to a following glottal stop or another 1.
A basic 1 is replaced by t when, through morphological change, it is followed
by a consonant other than ? or 1: citci-^a they are making rhythmic rattling
sounds, where reduplication of the root cili to make a rattling sound causes
the replacement of 1 by 1 because of the change of the following phoneme from
i to c; ?al-ka he fell asleep, containing -ka past added to a stem of the root
v
 ala to sleep; but ?el-?an where it is standing, in which the locative -?an is
•uffixed to a stem of the root ?ela to be standing.
   There is one morpheme, however, containing an 1 which is replaced by I
before 9 . The suffix -la objects in a shallow container (10.321), when it forms
the last portion of a stem which loses its final vowel, becomes -t before ? :
compare sa-t-^e a pan of dishes, where the suffix without its vowel is followed
by the singular -ve, with sa-la-'we9 pans of dishes where the full suffix is fol-
lowed by the plural -'we?.","[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]"

   10,23. Short Forms of the Singular and Plural A special type of inflectional
trfttment is accorded head terms having a Cv or CCv form and occurring
di fine-position stems in close-knit syntactic combinations. This treatment
ia primarily found in constructions which function as lexemic units. For the
moat part, the head terms are monosyllabic nouns of classes 1 or 2. In addition,
polysyllabic particles or polysyllabic nouns of class 1 (but not class 3) may be
abbreviated to a Cv or CCv structure (8.9); the abbreviated stem is then
given the special short form of inflection suffixed to a monosyllabic noun
which is the head term in a construction.
    10.231. -9 (with monosyllabic head terms, basic or abbreviated), singular
In constructions which are singular; -0 (with monosyllabic head terms, basic
or abbreviated), singular in constructions which are plural.

  One lexeme has been found in which the first element is derived from a
verb stem: ci-9 monne a rattle, containing ci- abbreviated from cili (verb class
10a) to make a rattling sound; ci-0 mo'we9 rattles.

in constructions which are singular or plural.

leather.
   he-' 9a9le9 an adobe brick, literally clay stone: he- abbreviated from heli
 (class 1) clay, mud.
   10.3. Noun-Forming Derivations. As compared to verbs, nouns are relatively
restricted in their techniques of derivation. Suffixation and compounding
are the two processes by which nouns may be formed.
    10.31. Inflectional Suffixes Forming Derivations from Constructions. As
illustrated above (10.23) unit lexemes may be expressed by syntactic con-
58      UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PUBLICATIONSstructions. In some lexemes of this kind the second term, though a verb
stem, appears with the number suffixes of noun class 1: -nne (singular), -'we9
 (plural). The first two examples in 10.231 show -nne attached to c9umme
 (verb class 9b) to be strong and -'we9 added to silowa (verb class 9b) to be
red. The form of the plural suffixed to the second term is determined by the
total construction rather than by the second term: the example in the last
paragraph of 10.231 has -'we9, normally the plural form added to poly-
syllabic roots, appended to the monosyllabic root mo (noun class 1) spherical
object. These suffixes, then, must be regarded as belonging to the total con-
struction rather than to the final word of the construction, like w s"" in ""the
Queen of England's visit."" The total construction is treated like a derived
noun, taking its own inflection and functioning as a substantive in the larger
syntactic context of the clause (15.22).
   9 9 9
    a k oskwi-nne window pane, literally mica sticking-out: -nne singular with
the construction containing k9oskwi (verb class 9a) to stick out.
   he pacci-'we9 tortillas, literally metal being-stuck-on, referring to the man-
ner of cooking tortillas on the metal surface of a stove: -'we9 plural with the
construction containing pacci (verb class 9a) to be stuck on.
   10.32. Derivational Suffixes. The only other suffixes which form nouns are
those added to particle or noun roots; nouns cannot be derived by suffixation
from verbs. The noun-forming suffixes belong to a single conceptual category,
indicating some type of collective or spatial grouping of plural objects or
of a mass entity. Some suffixes of this meaning category, which produce verbs
of class 9a as well as nouns, have already been described and illustrated
 (9.3212 a-h). Additional suffixes of the same semantic type, which form nouns
only, are described below.
   10.321. -la (with class 1 nouns) objects in a shallow container (forms class
3 nouns). Before the singular suffix -9e, -la becomes A. (see 3.3).
   lu-l-9e ashes in an ashtray: lu (class 1) ash, -9e singular.
   k9a-la-'w woffiye there are plates of water on it: k9a (class 1, plural only)
liquid, -'w < -'we9 plural (5.2).
   10.322. -limo (with particles and class 1 nouns) objects in a dispersed col-
lectivity (forms class 1 nouns).
   9
    ate-limo-nne-9si is it covered with blood?: 9ate (particle) blood, -nne sing-
ular, -9si interrogative enclitic.
   taya-limo-'we9 things with hair all over them: taya (class 1) hair of head,
-'we9 plural.
  10.323. -ipo (with class 1 nouns) objects in an arrangement (e.g., a stack,
a bundle) (forms class 1 nouns).
                                                     ZUNI GRAMMAR             59   kwa? ka'k?i ?el ?itona?ma'w ?akka sis saJpo-n teya9ka because he never ate
well, he was a skeleton: sa (class 1) bone, -n < -nne singular, sa-tpo skeleton,
literally bundle of bones.
   he-tpo-nne a bridle bit, literally metal in an arrangement: he (class 1)
metal, coin, -nne singular.
  10.324. -pa (with class 1 nouns) objects in a deep container (forms class 3
nouns).
  c^ina-p-^e papers in a drawer: c?ina (class 1) paper, letter, -?e singular.
  mo-pa-""we? spherical objects in deep containers, (e.g., truckloads of melons,
boxes of beads): mo (class 1) spherical object, -'wev plural.
   10.325. -pata (with class 1 nouns) objects in a wrapped bundle (forms
class 1 nouns).
   monk •)ikna') ci-pata-n tana he is a big bundle of hair like a monkey: & (class
1) body hair, -n < -nne singular.
   sa-pata-'we9 very skinny people, literally bones wrapped in bundles: sa (class
1) bone, -'we9 plural.
   10.33. Compounds. In addition to suffixation, compounding is a technique
for the construction of nouns. In a noun compound, thefirst-positionelement
is a noun stem with a monosyllabic (Cv or CCv) form, representing either the
complete monosyllabic noun or an abbreviation of a longer noun root. The
second-position stem may be either a noun or a verb. The total compounded
unit is inflected as a polysyllabic noun of class 1.
   Examples of noun plus noun compounds are: he-sonci-nne fork, containing
he (noun class 1) metal, coin, sonci (noun class 1) claw, fingernail, -nne
singular; tu-mok^k^a-'we9 stockings, socks, containing tu- abbreviated from
tukni (noun class 1) toe, mo^k^a (noun class 1) shoe, -#we? plural.
   Examples of noun plus verb compounds are: ta-tepowa-nne wagon, contain-
ing ta (noun class 2) wood, tepowa (verb class 9a) to be hitched; no-2api-'we9
coffee, containing no (noun class 1) kidney bean, capi (verb class 4a) to burn.","[56, 57, 58, 59]"
