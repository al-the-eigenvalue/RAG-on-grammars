      Aminat(ERG)    room-SREL        broom   sweep-AOR
      'Aminat swept the room with a broom.' (Lit. 'Aminat swept the
      broom through the room.')In the familiar European languages, the Lezgian local patients have to be
rendered as direct objects, and the Lezgian Absolutive themes correspond to
instrumental phrases. These instrumental phrases sound somewhat redun-
dant in the translations of (720M721) because the verbal actions ('stroke',
'sweep') are such that they are exclusively or typically carried out with these
instruments. But this is not the case in Lezgian because quite generally verb
meaning is more general than in the familiar European languages. For ex-
ample, gilc'un not only means 'stroke', but also 'wipe' (stoldiwaj pek giic'un
'wipe a table with a cloth') or 'rub', and elägun not only means 'sweep', but
also 'wave (with a cap)' and 'nod (one's head)'.
   These characteristics of Lezgian valence patterns can be generalized and
we can say that Lezgian shows a tendency toward a closer correspondence
between semantic roles and case-marking: Agents are always in the Ergative
case, themes are always in the Absolutive, recipients and experiencers are
always in the Dative, patients are always in one of the local cases. This is in
marked contrast to the familiar European languages, where nominative
subjects can be agents, themes, experiencers, and sometimes even patients,
accusative direct objects can be themes, patients, or experiencers, etc. It is
true that there are exceptions in Lezgian as well; for instance, the Absolutive
argument of kiligun (CABS/ DDAT) ' C looks at D' would appear to be an agent
rather than a theme, and Lezgian also has metaphorical expressions like i
banka.di pud litr q'ada (Talibov & Gad2iev 1966:207) 'this can holds three
liters'. But it cannot be denied that there is a tendency toward a closer link
between semantic roles and case-marking, so that we can call Lezgian a
""role-dominated language"" (cf. Foley & Van Valin 1984, A. E. Kibrik 1980b).",[290]

16.1. Grammatical relations: the notion of subject
16.1.1. Subject propertiesNotions such as subject, direct object, indirect object, etc. (i.e. grammatical
relations, or syntactic functions) are generally used sparingly in this book.
The reason is that their use is not as straightforward in role-dominated lan-
guages like Lezgian as it is in reference-dominated languages like English.
There are very few generalizations that need to be stated over grammatical
relations.
   The subject is the most important grammatical relation, and I will mostly
be concerned with this notion in this section. There is some evidence, albeit
rather slight, that a notion of subject is needed in Lezgian grammar. The ar-
guments that have subject status are the Absolutive argument of intransi-
tive verbs, the Ergative argument of transitive verbs, and the Dative argu-
ment in the Affective Construction.
   However, most of the properties that often serve to identify subjects in
other languages do not uniquely identify subjects in Lezgian. Following
Keenan (1976), we can divide subject properties into coding properties and
behavioral properties. Coding properties are case marking, subject-verb
agreement, word order and the like. Case marking would of course identify
the Absolutive argument both of intransitive and of transitive sentences as
the subject. However, case marking is not normally considered sufficient
evidence for grammatical relations in languages with ergative case marking.
Subject-verb agreement is lacking in Lezgian. There is some weak evidence
from word order that Ergative agents and Dative experiencers are both sub-
jects, because both precede the Absolutive argument in the unmarked order:(799) Alfija.di     maqala       kxe-na.

                                  Pronouns11.1. Personal pronouns
The personal pronouns are: 1SG zun T , 2SG wun 'you', 1PL tun 'we', and 2PL
kiln 'you-all'.
   The 2PL pronoun kiin is sometimes used as a form of polite address, ap-
parently under the influence of Russian.
   For the 3rd person, the demonstrative am (lit. 'that one') is used (cf. 11.4.,
22.1.).
   The case inflection of the 1st and 2nd person pronouns shows a few ir-
regularities in the Absolutive, Ergative, and Genitive cases. Also, the
oblique stem on which the Dative and the local cases are based is not identi-
cal with the Ergative case.","[203, 204]"

252     14. The noun phrase and the adjective phraseNominalized clauses have the external syntax of NPs but the internal syntax
of clauses (cf. the examples in (658)). They are therefore not discussed in this
chapter; see 19.1.2. for substantivized relative clauses, 20.3. for Masdar noun
clauses, and 20.4. for participial noun clauses).
   Pronouns in the strict sense are first and second person pronouns (zun,
wun, Hun, kiin), reflexive pronouns (zuw, wiö, öeb), and interrogative pro-
nouns ( w u i w u i ) . The other ""pronouns"" are all substantivized NP modi-
fiers, e.g. im 'this one', am 'that one, he/she/it' (substantivized forms of i
'this', a 'that'), sadni 'nobody' (substantivized form of sa-...-ni 'no', lit.
'even one'). See Ch. 11 for details on pronouns.
   Non-pronominal NPs generally have nouns as their head, but the head
may also be a substantivized NP modifier: a substantivized adjective, a sub-
stantivized quantifier or demonstrative, or a substantivized Genitive NP (cf.
8.1.1.).
   For apposition, see 14.3.
   Note that the above list of possible nominal modifiers does not include
postpositional phrases, NPs in oblique cases, or adverbs. Thus, a noun
phrase like 'stories about farm life' needs an additional verb ('written') to
make a relative clause:(659) Kolxoz.di-n     ja£aji£.di-kaj      k&e-nwa-j         rasskaz-ar   (E56:3)
      [kolkhoz-CEN      life-SBEL         write-PRF-PTP]    story-PL       'stories about collective farm life'Or an adjective based on a postposition may be used, e.g. wilikan                'previous'
for wilik 'before'.(660) revoljucija.di-laj      wilikan      ilmilr
      revolution-SREL         previous    life       'life before the revolution'Not infrequently the participial form of the copula tir is used to create a pos-
sible nominal modifier.(661) a. hajwan-r.i-kaj tir                max-ar (Du85,3:114)
          [animal-PL-SBEL      COP:PTP]    story-PL          'fairy tales about animals (lit. fairy tales which are about animals)'      b. Cexoslovakija.d-aj tir                  ajal-ar (K85,7:l)
          [Czechoslovakia-INEL      COP:PTP]     child-PL          'children from Czechoslovakia'However, the rule that postpositional phrases, oblique-case NPs, and ad-
verbs may not be nominal modifiers is now sometimes violated under the
influence of Russian.","[271, 272]"

m The Collected Works of
  Edward Sapir
m The Collected Works contain the published and unpublished works
      of Edward Sapir, a leading linguist and anthropologist of this century.
m     Volume VII · Wishram Texts and Ethnography
      Edited by William Bright
m     1990.17 χ 24 cm. 518 pages. Cloth.
      ISBN 311 012328 2
m     Sapir's first field work, carried out in 1905 while he was still a student,
      was with the Wishram, a Chinookan group of Washington State.
m     Accordingly, as the first of the monographic volumes in the Collected
      Works, the present Volume VII contains the two major publications
      which resulted from that field work, Wishram Texts of1909 and Wish-
MB    ram Ethnography, co-authored with Leslie Spier and published in
      1930. A retranscription and reinterpretation by Dell Hymes of the first
      narrative in the Wishram Texts is published here for the first time.
m       The incomplete index which was published with Sapir's and
      Spier's Wishram Ethnography has been replaced by a newly pre-
m     pared index which covers the entire contents of the present volume.m     Volume Vm · Takelma Texts and Grammar
      Edited by Victor Golla
m     1990.17x24 cm. 606 pages. Cloth.
      ISBN 311012329 0
m
      This volume contains Sapir's two major publications on Takelma,
      which show his record of the language and culture of this now extinct
      southern Oregon group to be extraordinarily comprehensive. In addi-
m     tion, a reinterpretation by Dell Hymes of the first narrative in Takelma
      Texts appears here for the first time.
         Before Sapir's work, the Takelmas were among the most poorly
m     documented Indian groups of the American West. Second only to his
      monumental grammar, texts, and dictionary of Southern Paiute
      (Volume X), Sapir's publications on Takelma, a language belonging to
m     no clearly defined subgroup within Penutian, constitute his most
      comprehensive descriptive treatment of a language.m

74 7. Noun morphology7.1.2. Case formation7.1.2.1. Introduction. There are eighteen cases in Lezgian: four grammatical
ones (Absolutive, Ergative, Genitive, Dative) and fourteen local cases di-
vided into five localizations (Ad, Post, Sub, Super, In), each of which has
three locatives (Essive, Elative, Directive) One combination, the ""In-
Directive"", is missing, so there are only 3 χ 5 - 1 = 14 combinations.
   To start with a concrete example, the singular inflection of sew 'bear' is:Absolutive          sew                 'the bear'
Ergative            sew-re              'the bear'
Genitive            sew-re-n            'of the bear'
Dative              sew-re-z            'to the bear'
Adessive            sew-re-w            'at the bear'
Adelative           sew-re-w-aj         'from the bear'
Addirective         sew-re-w-di         'toward the bear'
Postessive          sew-re-qh           'behind the bear'
Postelative         sew-re-qh-aj        'from behind the bear'
Postdirective       sew-re-qh-di        'to behind the bear'
Subessive           sew-re-k            'under the bear'
Subelative          sew-re-k-aj         'from under the bear'
Subdirective        sew-re-k-di         'to under the bear'
Superessive         sew-re-l            'on the bear'
Superelative        sew-re-l-aj         'off the bear'
Superdirective      sew-re-ldi          'onto the bear'
Inessive            sew-re              'in the bear'
Inelative           sew-räj             'out of the bear'The translations are merely illustrative; for more on the meanings of the
individual cases see 7.2.2. Note that the specific local relations that were
originally expressed by the local cases are now generally expressed by postpo-
sitions, while the local cases mainly express more abstract senses.
   The main difficulty is the formation of the oblique stem from the simple
stem (7.1.2.2.). Otherwise case inflection is straightforward and regular for all
declinable words (except for a few irregularities in pronouns, cf. 11.1.). The
Absolutive case is identical to the basic stem, and the Ergative case is identi-
cal to the oblique stem. The Genitive and Dative cases are formed by adding
-n and -z, respectively, to the oblique stem. The localizations are formed
from the oblique stem by adding their characteristic consonants -w (Ad), -qh
(Post), -k (Sub), respectively, and the Elative and Directive suffixes -aj and
-di are added to the localization suffixes. Only the In localization (7.1.2.3.)
and the Super localization (7.1.2.4.) require further comment.","[93, 94]"
"The examples above are from relative clauses. Omission of personal pro-
nouns in adverbial clauses, especially converbal adverbial clauses, is even
more common. Looking at Lezgian from the point of view of Russian or
English, pronoun dropping in relative clauses is unexpected, while corefer-
ential omission in converbal clauses is natural because Russian and English
converbs require coreferential omission. Cf.:                                             Brought to you by | Max-Planck-Gesellschaft - WIB6417

       b. Having said goodbye to Ali, he hurried toward the door.' (K86,2:8)
       c. ?? He having said goodbye...
But it seems that from the point of view of Lezgian, anaphoric omission of
the type seen in (1118M1121) is the same phenomenon as omission of the
type in (1122a). There seems to be a difference in the extent to which per-
sonal pronouns and reflexive pronouns are omitted: More commonly in
converbal clauses, less commonly in relative clauses and in main clauses.
But I know of no evidence for a difference in the grammatical status of these
types of omission. It is important to note that the use of a pronoun is never
excluded (unlike in English or Russian). For instance, in the following sen-
tence the subject of the subordinate clause might well have been
dropped/omitted, but it is present.","[423, 424]"

                              Verbal valence15.1. Verbal valence patterns: introductionVerbal valence patterns are represented here in the following format:      V (ACASEI/ BCASE2/···)where V stands for the verb, and A and Β stand for arguments in the case
indicated by the subscript (the order of the arguments is arbitrary). The let-
ters used as variables for arguments are arbitrary and serve only to distin-
guish different arguments. However, I will often use letters that can be
thought of as mnemonic for particular semantic roles (A: ""agent"", T:
""theme"", L: ""location"", E: ""experiencer"", R: ""recipient""). Otherwise no at-
tempt is made to systematically describe the semantic roles expressed by the
arguments; this information is left implicit in the translations of the indi-
vidual verbs.
   Let us take a concrete example: The verb ilisun has the valence pattern:      V (AERG/ TABS/ LSRESS)and means Ά presses L by putting Τ in contact with L (= A presses L with
T)'. This means that it has an (""agent"") argument in the Ergative case which
corresponds to the subject of 'press' in the translation, a (""theme"") argument
in the Absolutive case which corresponds to the object of 'put in contact
with', and a (""location"") argument in the Superessive case corresponding to
the object of 'press'. This is all the information contained in a valence
frame, and it is sufficient, for example, to obtain the correct translation of
the following sentence:(717) Ada      knopka.da-l     t'ub   ilis-na. (R66:9)
     he(ERG)   button-SRESS    finger press-AOR     'He pressed the button by putting his finger in contact with it.'
     (= 'He pressed the button with his finger.'
     Lit. 'He pressed his finger on the button.')15.2. General characteristics of verbal valence patternsThere are very tight restrictions on possible verbal valence patterns, espe-
cially the following:
   (i) There are no verbs that take fewer than one argument. Weather situa-
tions (rain, snow, etc.), which are expressed by zero-argument verbs in many                                      Brought to you by | Max-Planck-Gesellschaft - WIB6417

languages, are expressed as 'rain is falling' (marf qwazwa),  etc. (However,
predicative adjectives may be subjectless, cf. 17.3.)
   (ii) There are no verbs that take more than three arguments.
   (iii) Most of the valence patterns contain an Absolutive argument. There
are a few exceptions which belong to the ""non-standard valence patterns""
and are discussed in 15.4. below.
   (iv) For each intransitive valence pattern with an Absolutive argument
there is a corresponding transitive valence pattern which contains the same
arguments plus an Ergative argument.
   (v) Except for the purely adnominal Genitive case and the rare Directive
cases, all cases occur in at least one valence pattern together with an
Absolutive argument (but see 15.3.15. for ""Genitive arguments"").
   Thus, the valence patterns in (718) are the most typical, and they are
therefore called ""standard valence patterns"" here. Each of them is exempli-
fied in one subsection of 15.3.","[287, 288, 289]"

10   1. Introduction1.3.3. Grammatical terminologyAnother feature that contributes to the user-friendliness of this grammar is
the avoidence of opaque grammatical category labels such as ""5th Elative
case"" or ""3rd Past tense"". Instead, grammatical labels with some mnemonic
descriptive content have been chosen, such as ""Superelative case"" and ""Past
Perfect"". This meant that traditional Lezgian terminology had to be aban-
doned in several cases. However, the traditional terminology itself is by no
means uniform. For example, Gajdarov's (1987a) textbook differs substan-
tially from the earlier standard accounts of Talibov & GadZiev (1966) and
Mejlanova (1967). Other works such as Zirkov (1941) and Moor (1985) use
still different terms.
   The following table is a comparative list of the most important terms that
are most widespread in Russian-language studies of Lezgian and of the ter-
minology used in this grammar (my terminology is closest to Mel'iuk's
1988a).","[29, 30]"
"However, this construction is never used in the modern language, where
the instrumental function is expressed by the Superelative or Superessive
cases (cf. 7.2.2.14., 7.2.2.16.).",[104]

"When Dative arguments represent experiencer participants, they play a
privileged role and the case can be made that they are subjects (cf. 16.1.). The
construction with a Dative subject is called the Affective Construction in
Daghestanian linguistics (cf. Alekseev 1975, Sejxov 1986). The special status
of the Dative argument is one of the reasons why valence patterns with
Dative experiencers are given special treatment here. The valence pattern in
(742) is formally identical to the valence pattern in 15.3.2.1., but the two ar-
guments correspond to different semantic roles and show different syntactic
behavior.",[300]

quite regular. Only the stem sa differs in the way it forms its substantivized
form (suffixing of -d rather than -m, cf. 13.1.1.), and in that it lacks forms
corresponding to i&tin and iq'wan.
   The words iMin, iq'wan, etc., denoting quality and quantity, respectively,
are obviously related to the comparative particles xtin 'as, like' and q'wan
'as much/many as' (cf. 24.2.2.-3.).
   The presentative -nhe does not combine with the interrogative stem, but
it does combine with the other demonstratives (at'anhe, etc.).
   The local pro-adverbs can all be considered as derived from a place noun
whose oblique stem ends in -ni (ini- 'this place', am-'that place', etc.). Then
ina 'here' is the regular Inessive case, iniz is the regular Dative case, inaj is
the regular Inelative case, etc. In fact, many more forms than those that are
listed in Table 5 are possible. There is also a Postessive iniqh 'hither', an                                           Brought to you by | Max-Planck-Gesellschaft - WIB6417

   While there is no noun *in (pi. *in-ar) 'this place', from which all these
local case forms could be regularly derived, there is in fact a ""local noun""
charecterized by the suffix -nag (pi. -nag-ar) in the Absolutive case, e.g.
at'anag 'yonder place', wininag '(that) upper place', etc. The local adverbs
can be analyzed as derived from an irregular oblique stem of this word. Here
are two examples for the use of the local noun.(435) a. Inag              qenin          jiq.a-laj       wi       makan         ja. (AM87:13)

sidered above, there are a few other stems that can have local adverbs of this
kind. In particular, the universal quantifier wiri 'all' has a corresponding lo-
cal noun wir inag        'every place', as well as local case forms like
wirina / wirinra 'everywhere', wirinaj 'from everywhere', etc. The identity
pronouns masa 'other' and miikii 'the other' also have forms like masana
'elsehwere', miikixna 'at the other place'.
   Finally, the plural personal pronouns tun 'we' and kiln 'you-all' have lo-
cal case forms of the kind described here: öina 'at our place', küna 'at your
place', öiniz 'to our place', kü'niz 'to your place' etc. These forms are based
on the Genitive case forms 6i 'our' and kii 'your'. Note in particular that the
case forms of Hun and kiln are quite different from the above-mentioned
secondary local-noun-based case forms, cf.(436)                     pronouns                             local-noun-based case forms

190   11. Pronouns11.4. Demonstratives
There are six series of demonstratives in Lezgian:(438) i         'this'
      a         'that'
      at'a      'yonder'
      ha        'the aforementioned'
      wini      'that up there'
      aga       'that down there'There is a small irregularity in their substantivized forms: the Absolutive
singular form ends in -m, not in -d.i. But the oblique stem ends in -da-, just
like regular substantivized adjectives (cf. 8.1.1.).","[208, 209, 210]"
"
12.1.1. Spatial adverbsMost spatial adverbs are based either on spatial nouns or on pronominal
stems. Their characteristic suffix is generally identical to one of the local
cases. Most of the adverbs based on spatial nouns are also used as
postpositions (cf. 12.2.).
   For spatial adverbs based on pronominal stems, see 11.3.
   The most common local cases used for forming spatial adverbs are the
Inessive, the Dative and the Postessive (both used for direction), the
Superessive, and the Elative cases (used for source). The Directive cases are
also sometimes used to mark direction.",[225]
"
1.2.3. SyntaxWord order patterns in Lezgian are overwhelmingly head-final. This order
is obligatory in noun phrases (Genitive-noun, adjective-noun, numeral-
noun, demonstrative-noun, etc.), adjective phrases, and postpositional
phrases, and it is preferred for clauses. However, alongside SOV order other
orders are also possible, especially in the spoken language.
   The case-marking patterns in clauses is uniformly ergative, as shown in
(2) (for notational conventions used in example sentences, see 1.3.4.-5.).(2) a. Stxa         k'wal.i-z        xta-na.

"   The formation of ordinary and free-choice indefinites is quite straight-
forward: The indefiniteness-marking particle jat'ani /Aajit'ani follows the
corresponding interrogative pro-form, and in the case of the ordinary indef-
inite, the numeral sa 'one' in addition precedes the interrogative. The for-
mation of specific and negative indefinites is somewhat more complicated,
cf. 11.6.3.-4.
   When indefinites function as nominal modifiers, the particle iajit'ani
follows the whole noun phrase, while the particle jat'ani tends to follow
the interrogative immediately:(454) a. hi         waxt.und-a        Aajit'ani
         which      time-lNESS       INDEF
         'at any time'      b. sa   hi&tin jat'ani           qalabulux
         one which       INDEF       confusion
         'some sort of confusion'    The formal makeup of the two indefiniteness-markers jat'ani               and
itajit'ani is quite transparent: They are concessive conditional verb forms of
the standard copula ja and the verb £un 'be', respectively. Thus, the mean-
ing of wui itajit'ani is literally 'whoever it may be' (cf. 21.8.4., and the quite
analogous French form qui que ce soit).",[214]
"14.4. Word order in the noun phraseNoun phrases are strictly head-final. All types of modifiers precede their
head: quantifiers (see 14.2.), appositions (see 14.3.), demonstratives (cf. 683),
adjective phrases (cf. 684), Genitive NPs (cf. 685), and relative clauses (see
19.1.).(683) a       insan-ar     (J89:21)

24.1. Comparison of inequality
24.1.1. The comparative degreeThe comparative degree is expressed by the Superelative case (cf. 7.2.2.15.) on
the standard of comparison. Like all modifiers, the standard of comparison
precedes the parameter of comparison (adjective or adverb). This construc-
tion is only possible when the standard of comparison consists of a single
noun phrase. Example (1216) shows adjectives, and (1217) shows adverbs in
the comparative construction.(1216) a. Eger     wa-z        δι         mühilbbat        öan.di-laj     baha        ja-t'a...

          'In the Quba dialect ruk is used more than the word tam.' (G82:84)The explicit standard, i.e. a standard expressed as a number takes the same
form, as shown in (1218). In such cases the standard phrase has no corre-
sponding equivalent comparative clause.(1218) a. I&tin xzan.d-a           gah=gah      wike-laj        gzaf ks-ar             ze-da-j.

   When the standard of comparison does not inflect for case and therefore
cannot be in the Superelative case, it cannot be used in this construction and
a comparative clause (24.1.2.) has to be used. H o w e v e r , in some cases very
similar declinable forms are available, e.g. relative adjectives of temporal
adverbs (cf. 8.2.1.3.), as in (1219), or participial forms of converbal postposi-
tions, as in (1220). N o t e that adjectives and participles have to be substan-
tivized before they can be inflected for case.","[451, 452, 453]"
"14.3. Apposition
Appositions (NPs that serve as modifiers of nouns and have the same refer-
ent as the modified noun) precede their head noun and are always in the
Absolutive case, independently of the case of the head noun.
   Most instances of apposition involve a proper name. When the addi-
tional information consists of just a single noun, this single noun may be
the head of the NP and the proper name the apposition. The head noun in
this construction is typically a kinship term (673), a title (674), or a noun that
indicates which type of place a toponymic refers to (city, river, etc.) (675).(673) a. Nurali         buba.di         öanta      wiöi-n      wilik         ecig-na. (M83:74)

1.3.2. Structure of the grammarThe structure of this grammar follows the well-established traditional order:
phonology — morphology — syntax — texts. This ensures that the amount
of information that is presupposed in a given section but comes later in the
book is minimized.
   The morphological chapters deal with the form and the meaning of the
grammatical items of the language. For inflectional categories, the inflection
as a whole is first described, followed by a description of the meanings of the
individual inflectional categories. For derivational categories, form and
meaning are treated together.
   While the morphology takes the analytical perspective (from form to
function), the syntax takes the synthetic perspective (from function to form),
with chapter topics such as coordination, relative clauses, complement
clauses, adverbial clauses, coreference, questions, and comparison. All these
are taken as functional notions. For example, participial relative clauses and
correlative relative clauses show no formal similarities, but they are treated
together in Ch. 19 because of their similar function.
   Thus, this grammar to some extent fulfills the theoretical requirement to
present the grammatical information both from an analytical and from a
synthetic perspective (von der Gabelentz 1901, Lehmann 1980). For example,
the functions of the Dative case are described twice: First from an analytical
perspective in the chapter on nominal inflection (7.2.2.4.); and then from a
synthetic perspective in the sections on verbal valence (15.3.2., 15.4.1.), on
adjectival valence (14.5.1.1.), and on spatial and temporal adverbials
(16.3.1.1., 16.3.2.1.). Similarly, the functions of the Aorist converb are de-
scribed twice: First in the chapter on verbal inflection (9.9.4.), and then in
the sections on adverbial clauses (21.1.) and on complement clauses (20.6.1.-
2.). Sometimes only cross-references are made to avoid unnecessary repeti-
tions.
   However, this grammar, too, has an analytical bias. Not everything is de-
scribed from a synthetic point of view. For example, there is no function-to-
form treatment of tense meanings, or of number meanings. For such phe-
nomena, the form-to-function description must suffice.",[29]
"In addition to the consonants of the standard language (as given in Table 3),
many dialects have some of the following consonants:
—the voiced alveolar and postalveolar affricates /dz/, /dzw/, and /φ/;
—the postalveolar labialized obstruents /(fw/, /tfhw/, /tf'w/, //w/, /3W/, /<£w/. These
are characteristic of the Samur dialect group. There is even one word in the
standard language with such a consonant: maiw /macfew/, plural mac'war
/ma'tfwar/ 'astragal', as well as the sound-symbolic words c'wärq' 'slap in the
face', ö'wäq'räq' 'click' (Mejlanova 1964:387);
—the voiced uvular stop /g/;
—the voiced velar fricative /γ/;
—the epiglottal fricatives Λ/ and /h/.
   The aspirated labialized alveolar affricate /tshw/ is part of the system but is
extremely rare (Mejlanova 1970:40). It occurs at least in the Güne dialect
form /rytshwer/ 'grass snakes' (standard rilcer /rytsher/).
   The alveolar affricates /dz/ and /<&/ occur in the Küre dialect group, but in
the other dialects they mostly fell together with /z/ and ITJ, respectively.
According to Mejlanova (1970:38) /z, dz/ and /3, <fe/ are not distinguished in
the standard pronunciation. Here it is not quite clear what the orthoepic
norm is. As in the case of /as/ above, the orthography, which only uses <>κ> /
and <3> z, apparently has an effect on what is considered the standard
pronunciation. In those dialects where /z/ and /dz/ are distinguished, there
are rather few words containing /dz/ (Mejlanova 1970:37), e.g.(30) /ladz/           'white clay'           standard:      laz        /laz/
     /qadz/           'underwood'                          qaz         /qaz/
     /wardz/          'month; moon'                        war ζ       /warz/
     /medz/           'tongue'                             me ζ        /mez/
     /murdz/          'flame; edge'                        murz        /murz/
     /dzaKam/         'shrub'                              zaga m      /zaKam/In contrast, /φ/ is quite frequent as it occurs in numerous Arabic and Turkic
loanwords.
   The recent phonological change of Pretonic High Vowel Syncope has led
to the emergence of quite a few obstruents that are distinctively palatalized
(cf. 4.1.1.). They are not included in the consonant inventory here because
the change is quite recent and all its implications have yet to be worked
out—this is a fruitful area for further research.",[53]

"14.1. General properties of the noun phrase
A noun phrase (NP) consists of either (i) a pronoun (in the strict sense, i.e. a
pro-NP), or (ii) a noun head and optional preceding modifiers (quantifiers,
demonstratives, adjective phrases, Genitive NPs, relative clauses), or (iii) a
nominalized clause, i.e. either a substantivized relative clause (with a sub-
stantivized participle as its head) or a noun clause (with a Masdar or a sub-
stantivized participle as its head). Examples:(656) Pronoun:
     Zun          ata-na.
      I:ABS     come-AOR      Ί came'(657) Noun head plus preceding modifiers:
      Zi  gweö'i wax     ata-na.

the first group, there is a Dative argument with subject properties (15.4.1.),
and in the second group, the Absolutive argument has been incorporated
into the verb so that there is no Absolutive argument in the valence pattern
(""Absolutive absorption"", 15.4.2.1.).
   The valence patterns of verbs that take clausal arguments (=complement
clauses) have not been taken into account here. For such complement-tak-
ing verbs, see Ch. 20.
   The general principles to which Lezgian valence patterns conform
(especially (i)-(v) above) are not particularly exotic or exceptional. Aside
from Ergativity, there are only two features that set Lezgian off from the fa-
miliar European languages: Dative experiencers and consistent Absolutive

expressions (cf. 15.4.1.), the experiencer is expressed in the Dative case:(719) Zamira.di-z      Diana        aku-na.
      Zamita-DAT       Diana       see-AOR
      'Zamira saw Diana, (lit. Diana was visible to Zamira.)'And themes are consistently in the Absolutive case, even where a patient
argument is also present and would be the direct object in the familiar
European languages. In Lezgian, this patient is expressed in one of the local
cases. For example, the patient arguments of the verbs 'stroke' and 'sweep'
appear in the Adelative and Superelative cases, respectively, in the follow-
ing examples (an analogous example is (717) above).","[289, 290]"

are listed in dictionaries in this form. The Masdar is an action nominaliza-
tion. For instance, the verb stem aqwaz- 'stop' has the Masdar aqwaz-un,
which means '(the fact or action of) stopping'.
   The Masdar is noun-like only with respect to its external syntax: It can be
inflected for any case (the oblique stem is in -(u)n-i-, cf. 7.1.2.2. (C)), and it
can occur in all environments where NPs can occur. However, in its inter-
nal syntax, it behaves completely like a verb. It does not take adjective or
Genitive modifiers or determiners; but it does take adverbial modifiers, and
the verbal arguments appear in the same form as in finite clauses.(336) qhsan-diz          k'walax-un

but the situation meaning is more common.","[172, 173]"
"22.1. Pronominal anaphora and pronoun dropping
The substantivized demonstrative am (11.4.) 'that one' serves as a personal
pronoun corresponding to 'he/she/it'. Since Lezgian verbs do not show
agreement with their arguments, personal pronouns are in principle neces-
sary to distinguish between different persons and numbers. Thus, Lezgian is
not a pronoun-dropping (""pro-drop"") language. The examples in (1117) rep-
resent the standard case of coreference expressed by the personal pronoun of
the third person.(1117) a. Paka.di-n         juq.u-z      muk.a-n     xalis ijesi-jar       xta-na.      Abur

                              Phonotactics
4.1. Vowel syncope
4.1.1. Pretonic High Vowel SyncopeApparently quite recently a phonological change has taken place in many
dialects (including the dialect on which the standard language is based)
which radically altered the phonotactics of the language: Loss of pretonic
high vowels after voiceless obstruents. This vowel syncope is largely ig-
nored by the standard orthography (thus presumably facilitating its use by
speakers of non-syncope dialects). I will sometimes use the term ""pre-syn-
cope"" here to refer to the state of the language before the loss of the pretonic
high vowels.
   In quite a few cases the spelling vacillates — sometimes the high vowel is
written and sometimes it is omitted. In the following examples, the non-
standard (but occurring) spelling is marked by an asterisk (*).(31) syncope reflected      syncope not reflected

initial consonant clusters have not prevented the syncope. Here are more

two obstruents, even in the structure CVrC, i.e. when an r intervenes be-

stronger than from any other language. This is quite natural because of the
overwhelming significance of Russian in Soviet society. It is quite difficult
to establish the extent to which Russian loanwords have entered Lezgian
because a large number of Lezgian speakers (especially in Daghestan) also
know Russian and ad hoc borrowings are very common.
   In several cases, Oriental loanwords that were formerly in use have been
replaced by Russian loanwords that are now standard (cf. Gjul'magomedov
1982b:114-115). Such cases can perhaps be taken as evidence for deliberate
Russification of Lezgian.","[46, 47]"
"   In example (342) below, the Masdar form luhunar is clearly nominal be-
cause it is plural, but on the other hand it takes an Absolutive direct object

and verbal Masdar are not entirely separate categories. In this case, the reten-
tion of the verbal marking is probably due to the non-referentiality of
manijar. Manijar luhun is practically a noun-verb compound with the
meaning 'sing'.",[174]

them as well. (Russian loanwords, however, are not included because the
almost universal Lezgian-Russian bilingualism makes it very hard to de-
termine which words are integrated and which words are used in their
Russian form.) Furthermore, not all clusters allowed in Arabic are allowed
in Lezgian: For instance, Arabic words ending in a cluster of the type TR, e.g.
sabr 'patience' cannot appear as such in Lezgian (*sabr), and a vowel must
be inserted: sabur. (However, it may be that the necessary adjustments have
been made in the mediating Turkic language, cf. Turkish sabir; it seems
that there are no consonant clusters in Turkic that are impermissible in
Lezgian.)
   There are very few restrictions on morpheme-internal clusters in loan-
words. In the following I give one example for each cluster that is attested.","[62, 63]"
"22.4. Reflexivization
The usual means for marking coreference within a clause are the reflexive
pronouns (11.2.): wit for 3rd person singular, 6eb for 3rd person plural, zuw
for 1st and 2nd person singular. As in the case of coreferential omission, the
precise syntactic conditions for the use of reflexive pronouns are not easy to
determine, and a lot depends on the pragmatics.",[428]

1.3.4. Example sentencesThis grammar provides rich exemplification of the covered material. The
purpose of this is to make as many data as possible available to the reader.
The reader may not agree with the proposed analyses and some of the de-
scriptions may turn out to be incorrect, but the example sentences will not
lose their usefulness.
   Each example that has a number of its own illustrates a point in the de-
scription. When several examples illustrate the same point, they are distin-
guished by the letters (a), (b), (c), etc.
   The overwhelming majority of example sentences were taken from orig-
inal Lezgian texts and thus represent ""real language"". The source of each
text example is indicated in parentheses following the example. (The num-
ber following the colon is the page number.) Example sentences where no
source is indicated were elicited from native speakers (see the acknowledg-
ments).
   The following abbreviations of the sources of the examples have been
used:

1.3.5. Notational conventions for morpheme-by-morpheme glosses1.3.5.1. General rules. In example sentences, all inflectional affixes are sepa-
rated by hyphens from their adjecent affix(es) or the stem. Derivational af-
fixes are separated only in the relevant sections of the morphology. Each
morpheme separated by a hyphen in the Lezgian text corresponds to an
element in the morphemic gloss. Stems are translated by English words, af-
fixes by abbreviated category labels.(i) When one Lezgian morpheme must be translated by two gloss elements
(English words or category labels), these are separated by a period, e.g.eQeö'-un                                   jaru-bur
go.out-MSD                             red-SBST.PL
(ii) When a category is expressed, but is not expressed by a separable mor-
pheme, it is separated in the gloss by a colon.wuna            (w-una? wu-na? wun-a?)
you:ERGzi              (z-i? zi-0?)

14       1. Introduction(iii) When a category is expressed by zero, its category label is put in paren-
theses.kilig!                     instead of:   kilig-0
look(IMPV)                               look-IMPV
1.3.5.2. Zero. Categories that are always expressed by zero are not shown in
the morphemic glosses for economy, e.g.ktab-ar                    instead of:   ktab-ar                 or:      ktab-ar-0
book-PL                                  book-PL(ABS)                    book-PL-ABS
k'el-zawa                  instead of:   k'el-zawa               or:      k'el-zawa-0
read-IMPF                                read-IMPF(NONPAST)              read -IMPF-NONPAST
1.3.5.3. Oblique stem suffix. A period in nouns separates the stem from the
(semantically empty) oblique stem suffix. Thus,dide.di-z                  instead of:   dide-di-z
mother-DAT                               mother-OBL-DATtar-ar.i-kaj               instead of:    tar-ar-i-kaj
tree-PL-SBEL                             tree-PL-OBL-SBEL
The Ergative case is marked by zero (like the Absolutive), but since the
Ergative case is formed from the oblique stem, it is always clearly distinct
from the Absolutive. It is therefore also shown in the morphemic glosses, as
an exception to 1.3.5.2. above.dide.di                    instead of:   dide.di                 or:      dide-di-0
mother(ERG)                              mother                          mother-OBL-ERG

(4) In personal pronouns (including reflexive pronouns), the oblique stem
suffix is not even shown by a period, again for reasons of economy.za-waj                     instead of:   z.a-waj                 or:     z-a-waj

8.1.3. Predicative suffixes on adjectives8.1.3.1. The predicative suffix -da. The Lezgian grammatical literature men-
tions a suffix -da that can be attached to adjectives and gives them a predica-
tive function (Uslar 1896:93-95,190-194; GadZiev 1954:48; Ramaldanov 1980).
There is also a corresponding Past tense form -da-j.(271) öimi           'warm'                  öimida         '(it) is warm'
      meq 'i         'cold'                  meq'ida        '(it) is cold'
      q^san          'good'                  qhsanda        'is good'
     giSin           'hungry'                giSinda        'is hungry'
      Sirin          'sweet'                 Sirinda        'is sweet'   This suffix is not used in the modern standard language, except in the
cases k'anda 'wants', öida 'knows', t'ada 'hurts', kiö'eda 'fears' (9.5.2.1.-4.),
which are treated as verbs in this grammar.
   The Future suffix -da is clearly also related to predicative -da and to -da
in k'an-da etc. The most likely scenario that relates these three instances of
-da is the following: -da is originally a copula, closely related etymologically
to the standard copula ja and the local copulas aw a etc. (d/j are originally
different gender markers, and aw- etc. are preverbs). It was suffixed to adjec-
tives, yielding forms as in (271) and to (some kind of participial form of)
verbs, yielding a general present tense which was later restricted to habitual
and future uses (9.3.2.4.). Adjectival forms as in (271) then fell into disuse,
surviving only in forms like k'anda etc. (which had become verbs).
   Most examples of predicative -da that are given in the sources are from
adjectives denoting environmental and psychological states, often lacking a
subject (or at least an Absolutive subject).(272) a. Qe           serin-da.         (G54:48)
           today      cool-PRED           Today it is cool.'      b. K'wal-e               öimi-da-i-ir.          (G54:48)
           room-INESS          warm-PRED-NEG-PST         'It wasn't warm in the room.'
      c. Za-z meq'i-da. (G54:48)

      d. Za-z giUn-da.                   (TG66:87)

"7.3.1. Derivational suffixesThe following derivational suffixes will be treated here. Only the first three
are native, the others were borrowed and have not become truly productive.  -wal                     abstract nouns (from adjectives and nouns)
  -wi                      nouns of origin (from place names)
  -qhan                    profession (from nouns)
  -hi                      profession (from nouns)       (Turkic)
  -lux                     object (from nouns)           (Turkic)
  -gan                     object (from nouns)           (Turkic)
  -xana                    house (from nouns)            (Persian)
  -ban                     profession                    (Persian)7.3.1.1. -wal. This suffix (oblique stem -wili, plural -wiler) is extremely pro-
ductive. It forms abstract nouns from qualitative adjectives (cf. 227) and
from nouns (cf. 228), and in a few cases from adverbs (cf. 229).(227)    qacu-wal           greenness                 qacu              green

regular and common that it could perhaps be regarded as an inflectional suf-
fix. In order to express 'work as an X', one has to use it: X-wal awun (lit. 'do
X-hood'), or X-wile k'walaxun (lit. 'work in X-hood'), e.g.          muallimwal
awun 'work as a teacher', regiixbanwile k'walaxun 'work as a miller'. That
-wile in such constructions is a sort of ""functive case"" suffix can be seen in
examples like (230), where -wile is added to a plural noun.",[125]
"  The particle jtiz can also be used in cases of multiple equative comparison
where the verb is omitted in the equative expression. This is in contrast to
multiple comparison of inequality (24.1.2.), where the verb must be present
even under identity. The difference seems to be due to the fact that the
marker of inequality is a case suffix, which can attach only to one noun,
whereas jtiz is a free particle which can follow a group of words.",[457]
"   Since the standard of comparison is marked by the Subelative case (cf.
24.1.1.), and not by a particle as in English or Russian, it is easy to question it

and -iz in weak verbs. Since the Infinitive is also used in converbal func-
tion, it will sometimes be referred to as the Imperfective converb. There is
no formal difference associated with the two functions, except that the con-
verb is sometimes reduplicated (cf. 21.2. for details). Unlike the Masdar, the
Infinitive cannot be inflected like a noun. In view of its likely origin in a
Dative case marker, this is not surprising.","[149, 150]"

12.2.1. Postpositions that are identical to spatial adverbs Most spatial postpositions are identical in form to spatial adverbs (cf. 12.1.1.).
They are either derived from the spatial adverbs, or they are perhaps
 derived in the same way from the same spatial nouns as the spatial adverbs.
    Generally both the Essive and the Elative forms are used as postpositions,
 the meaning difference being completely parallel to that in the local cases
 (cf. 7.2.2.5.-18.).
    As one would expect for postpositions based on nouns, they generally
.govern the Genitive case of their argument. However, some postpositions
 take Absolutive, Dative, Superelative or Inessive arguments.12.2.1.1. qene 'inside; within' (cf. 12.1.1.1.) takes a Genitive argument. The
meaning is most often temporal, 'within'.(516) a. Wuöiz i      pud jis.a-n      qene     xp-er.i-n           sar

"10.2. The anticausativeA considerable number of transitive weak verbs allow the derivation of a
corresponding anticausative. This is formed from the stem of the base verb
and the verb xun 'become, be'. (Alternatively, one could say that the anti-
causative is derived from the Periphrasis form of the base verb. Since anti-                                     Brought to you by | Max-Planck-Gesellschaft - WIB6417

166     10. Verbal derivationcausatives can only be derived from weak verbs, whose Periphrasis form is
identical to their stem, it is impossible to decide whether the anticausative is
derived from the stem or from the Periphrasis form.)(375)      xkaiun      'raise, lift'   xkazotun             'rise'

        tiik'iirun     Tsuild, form' tük'ür £un             'be formed (in grammar)'As the examples show, anticausatives denote processes that are conceived of
as occurring without an external agent (i.e. the agent is not just back-
grounded, as it is in passive constructions in other languages, but com-
pletely eliminated from the conceptual structure). This semantic property
accounts for the restricted nature of the anticausative derivation: many
transitive events simply cannot be conceptualized as occurring without an
external agent. For instance, horn geqigun 'compare', there is no *geqig £un
'undergo comparison' because comparisons are not conceived of as occur-
ring without an agent who does the comparing.
   In some cases the process denoted by the anticausative is not inactive —
in such cases an English translation by means of a reflexive verb is some-
times appropriate.(376) jaraq'lamiSun      'arm'        jaraq'lamiSxun         'arm oneself'

       inandirmi&un      'convince' inandirmiS£un            'arrive at a conviction'   When a transitive verb is derived from a noun or adjective by means of
awun (cf. 10.6.) or -ar- (cf. 10.6.3.), a corresponding intransitive verb also
often exists. The relationship between these two verbs then looks very simi-
lar to the relationship between transitives and anticausatives as in (375).
However, in the following pairs (377-378) the intransitive members are not
derived from their transitive counterparts, but both are derived from the
same third word. The examples in (375-376) are crucially different in that the
transitive member of the pair is a primary verb (at least synchronically).(377) k'wat'     'lump':

Preverbs are verbal prefixes with an original locative meaning, quite similar
to Indo-European preverbs as in trans-fer, con-fer, de-fer, etc. In contrast to
all the other derivational categories described here, preverbs are no longer
productive in Lezgian (they are still quite regular and productive in the
closely related Tabasaran).
   About 18 preverbs can be identified, and two dozen verb roots occur with
identifiable preverbs. Six roots occur with more than ten different preverbs,
but quite a few are not combined with more than a handful.
   In most cases, the meaning of the preverb is no longer clearly discernible,
and it may be that the majority of preverb verbs listed below are no longer
analyzed by native speakers, so that the analysis is only diachronically valid.
Nevertheless, in some cases the meaning of the preverb and its contribution
to the derived verb's meaning are quite clear, e.g.(379) preverb Aq- 'out'
      aq-atun       'fall out'
      eq-eö'un      'go out'
      aq-udun       'take ouf
      eq-isun       'stick out'(380) preverb      'approaching'
      ag-a£u η       'approach'
      eg-et'un       'go (up) to'
      ag-aq'un       'reach'
      ag-udun        'move (up) to'(381) preverb Al- 'off'
      al-udun        'take off'
      al-azun        'tear off'
      al-atun        'fall off
      al-at'un       'cut off'The preverbs not only modify the meaning of the root of a verb, they also
co-determine the valence pattern of the verb (cf. 10.3.2.). These valence pat-
terns are usually preserved even where the meaning is totally idiomatic.","[185, 186, 187]"

14.4.1. The position of the Genitive NPThe Genitive NP generally precedes all other modifiers because otherwise
those modifiers could be taken as modifying the Genitive noun rather than
its head. In example (686), the Genitive NP precedes an adjective (a), a
demonstrative (b), a quantifier (c), a numeral (d), and even a relative clause
(e) (but see 14.4.2. for the order of relative clauses).(686) a. gatfar.i-n         öimi jug (A90:5)

noun: short pronominal Genitives (cf. 687) and non-referential Genitive
modifiers that correspond to English first compound members and to
Russian relational adjectives (cf. 688).

is extremely unlikely in (687) (personal pronouns are hardly ever modified),
and non-referential Genitives form fixed expressions with their head nouns
in (688), the danger of confusion is small.
   When a plausible meaning results, two Genitive NPs may modify the
same head noun:(689) a. öi            a        6'aw.a-n predsedatel'             (R66:12)

14.4.2. The position of the relative clauseThe participial relative clause is generally the first constituent of its NP be-
cause of its heaviness. If other modifiers preceded the relative clause, these
would be relatively far away from their head nouns. E.g.(690) wa-l             tapSurmiS-da-j           sa c'iji kar (E56:14)
      [you-SRESS entrust-FUT-PTP]               one new     job      'a new job that will be entrusted to you'When this preference is in conflict with the preference that the Genitive NP
should be the first constituent of the NP (14.4.1.), both orders are possible,
and the order which causes least ambiguity in the context wins out.","[280, 281]"

form of a postposition, but it is more commonly expressed in the same way
as position (except in the most general type of location, where direction is

232   13. Numerals and particles
  In complex numerals, addition is always signaled by -ni 'and':(587) 3895      pud       agzur-ni        miiiiid      wiS-ni q'udqan-ni             c'uwad

                (= 3 x 1000 + 8 χ 100 + 4 χ 20 + 15)   When the cardinal numbers are used attributively, the counted noun is
always singular, e.g. c'ud nük' 'ten birds' (*c'ud nilk'er).
   However, according to GadZiev (1954:155), the counted noun may be in
the plural when one cardinal numeral modifies several nouns that denote
different things, e.g.(588) wiS-ni        jaxc'ur-ni       c'ud     k'el-er        wa        bac'i-jar.
      100-and       40-and           10       lamb-PL        and      kid-PL
      'a hundred and fifty lambs and kids'
13.1.2. Substantivized cardinal numerals   All cardinal numbers can be used either attributively or independently,
just like other modifying expressions. When used independently, the last
component of the numeral is inflected for case and even number, much
like substantivized adjectives and demonstratives. Numerals ending in -d
follow the case inflection pattern of substantivized adjectives (cf. 8.1.1.), ex-
cept that in the singular they do not add a suffix -da, but only a suffix -a.
Synchronically this is a kind of morphological haplology, but diachronically,
the final -d of these numerals is apparently the substantivizing -d, which
was extended (in all numerals except 1 and 2) also to the attributive forms.","[251, 252]"
"The Dative case aradiz,          expressing direction, also exists:(550) Lezgi      xalq'.di-n      aradiz       arab       ö'al       ök'a-na. (K89,7:15)

"
24.1.2. The comparative clauseWhen more than one feature is changed in the compared situation, a com-
parative clause has to be used. This is expressed by putting the verb in the
substantivized participle form in the Superelative case. Compare (1222), a
o n e - w a y comparison, with (1223), a t w o - w a y comparison w i t h a
comparative clause. Although the verb is identical in examples like (1223), it
cannot be omitted because there is no w a y the Superelative case could have
scope over two noun phrases without a verb.",[453]
