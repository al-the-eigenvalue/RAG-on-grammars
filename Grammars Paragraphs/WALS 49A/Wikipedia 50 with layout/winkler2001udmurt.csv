 2.1 The accusative is the case of the direct object of transitive verbs. The accusative without a                              I             street-EL       malicious      dog-ACC/nice house(-ACC)         see-PRET/1SG

if the object is definite. According to the common definition the following constituents are                           In other words, the marked accusative                     is used if the object itself is focused, whereas   the

definiteness is not as clear-cut as for singular constituents. As a rule the unmarked accusative                                I             DEM        town-IN-       whole    year(-ACC)    _ live-PRET/1SG

4.2 Some verbs govern an ablative complement like kiSkani ‘to be afraid of , mezmini     ‘to pine’,   5.2 Dative adjuncts have two functions, final or temporal. In the former cases the adjunct
vatini ‘to hide from’.                                                                                expresses the aim, in the latter the temporal extension of the action.

3) The PX with -i- (instead of -e-) appear:
a) with a group of words, mostly expressions for parts of the body, for inner and outer charac-
teristics and for time units and kinship terms, in the nominative and some other cases (cf. 6), for
example ket-i ‘my stomach’, vin-id ‘your sister’;
b) after the plural marker, e5-jos-iz ‘his/her friends’.
4) The 1SG has its own (historically primary) suffix -7 in some oblique cases. In the accusative
this m follows directly after the stem resp. the plural marker: e§-m-e ‘my friend (ACC)’, e5-jos-
m-e ‘my friends (ACC)’.
In all the other persons the consonant alone is used (voiceless obstruent after voiceless conso-
nant) followed by the accusative suffix which differs in the SG from the PL: e-/-e ‘your friend
(ACCY’ vs e§-t-es ‘your (PL) friend (ACC)’.

Otherwise the PX is added to the noun:                                                                2) Partly different case suffixes are used.

Definiteness can be marked morphologically in Udmurt. Strictly speaking it is a kind of con-          2.3.2.1 Personal pronounstrastive emphasis whose background need not be expressed explicitly in the context.                   The deviations mentioned above concern the personal pronouns of the 1SG/PL and 2SG/PL,The domain of this category are the primarily attributively used parts of speech, i. e. cases like:   namely:(84)          badzim-es-jos-az                  gurt-jos-in                                           1) Stem variants: in the singular mon- ~ min-, ton- ~ tin- (the last one in the genitive, ablative          large-PL-PL-DEF/IN _ village-PL-IN                                                          and dative), in the plural mi- ~ mil'- and ti- ~ til’- (the latter in the accusative und instrumental          ‘in the large villages’                                                                     too);In the field of the accusative object the ending is traditionally classified as a case suffix (see    2) other case suffixes: accusative 0 or -ez vs -e (cf. accusative of nouns with PX); ablative -les

The last example reveals another function of the definite suffix, namely a kind of partitive;
literally ‘of the people much’.
The declension of nouns with the definite suffix is identical with that of nouns + PX 3SG except

 Besides the morphologically marked categories there are also those marked with the help of

‘go’. Semantically, the action they express is undirected (even veil ini, russ. xoduarte). Examples:                 become tired-GER-3SG       run-PRET-3SG
vigi-sa ulini ‘to live in permanent ill condition’ (viSini ‘be ill’), ZugiSki-sa bod ‘ ind fight (often,             ‘He ran until he became tired’
instantly)"" (zugigkini ‘fight’), cirdi-sa pukini ‘be engaged in singing’ (cirdin i sie ). .                 4. As already mentioned, the participle with -mon appears as a gerund

 Examples: kirga-sa lezini ‘begin to sing’ (kirgani ‘sing’), ee                   tothinl     to become              “He spoke comprehensibly’

 Se                 See     of the modified verb, secondary nuances can come to the fore.                  In connection with verbs meaning ‘finish’ (see 2.3.1.2, 12) the action

 Udmurt has probably borrowed the pattern for those constructions from Tatar.                              can be expressed with this gerund in EL: kopa-mif dugd-i-z ‘he finished
                                                                                                                                                                                    digging’.
 2. Gerunds with -ku'? have the function of temporal adverbs or adverbal clauses (simultaneity).
 To this gerund a PX (with exceptional -m in the 1SG) can be added.                                        2.5 Other grammatical classes

under the table’ etc. For the use of PX in postpositional syntagms see 2.3.1.3.                      ‘even though’); gine (no) ‘as soon as’;
Some postpositions function as an adverb, like ulin ‘down’.                                          c) sentence-initial: ugos, mali ke Suono ‘because’ (lit. ‘if why to say’).
2.5.2 Prepositions
In Udmurt the the prepositions are not old and their number very restricted. There are only three,
biden, kotir ‘per, one by one’ and og ‘about’, and they demand the NOM.
2.5.3 Particles
The particles can be divided in subgroups regarding their functions, their positional features
(some of them are placed after the corresponding constituent) and the question whether they
appear independently or not.
a) Degree particles: they are focus-binding and their semantic function is scaling (up or down)
or quantifying. For example Capak, samoj ‘just’, gine ‘only’ (always following), ke no (fol-
lowing) ‘at least’, no ‘too’ (following), ik ‘even’ (following), (i)niOa ‘already’ (following), na
‘still, yet’ (following), twz ‘very’, -ges (added to nouns) ‘just’ ete.
b) Modal particles modify the illocutionary force of the sentence and their use is mostly sen-
tence-type-sensitive, for example ben ‘surely not (in yes/no interrogative sentences)’, Sat and

Structures with the following four verbal forms belong to this kind of subordination: (1) infini-       the postposition governed by the verb of the higher sentence:
tive, (2) nouns derived from verbs by the suffix -on/-n, (3) participles and (4) gerunds. Their use     (238)   jegit-jos       pumisk-on       _ dir-ja_peresé          vu-i-z
is not connected with a separate subordinating element.                                                         youth-Pl_   meet-NOMIN during oldman           come-PRET-3SG
These four structures serve for different purposes and are only occasionally interchangeable.                   ‘During the meeting of the youths the old man came’
There is one important difference in the syntactical functions they have: Gerunds are only              (239)   sajkit      salkim-in         pumisk-on-mi               dir-ja_pereé         vu-i-z

participles only attributes; the other ones appear  in all syntactical functions. A second difference           ‘During our meeting in the cold shadow the old man came’
exists with regard to subject and time reference between the embedded and the higher sentence:          (240)   malpaski                 soos-ti       kizi —_ vost-on                Sarif

Udmurt has a number of constructions expressing modal functions, which are formed according                   i-stem               a-stem
to a fixed syntactic pattern.                                                                         1SG     ug mini-sk-i         ug uda-sk-i             ugmin-i          ug uza      ejmin-i    ej uza
