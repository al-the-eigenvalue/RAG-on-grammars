"Many languages, although not allowing free word order, allow more than one possible
word order. In Iquito, this is also the case. However, a sentence with basic word order ischaracterized as being least specific and least marked, morphologically as well aspragmatically, and although frequency of use is not a necessary part of the definition ofbasic word order, in Iquito the most common word order is in fact the basic word order.",[63]

"1.2.4 Features of Local Spanish as Phenomena of Language Contact       Local Spanish in the community of San Antonio de Pintuyacu displays strikingdifferences from the regular Latin American Spanish and Regional Amazonian Spanish,spoken in the city of Iquitos. Regional Amazonian Spanish is structurally the same as thecommon Latin American Spanish with the addition of regional vocabulary. Local Spanishin the community is quite different, not just in terms of its special vocabulary, but in thegrammar as well. This profound difference has presumably been around for at least sixtyyears. Due to its grammatical difference from the regional and Latin American Spanish, itpresents a border case between ‘a dialect of Spanish’ and ‘a creole.’ The current localSpanish in the community could be derived from both the substrate influence of theIquito grammar and the effect of second language acquisition. At the very least, itpresents an interesting case of a language-contact phenomenon. In the following, Idiscuss the fundamental grammatical characteristics of the Spanish spoken in SanAntonio de Pintuyacu.",[33]

2.3.1 Basic Word Order       This section discusses and defines the basic word order of Iquito. The discussionof basic word order here concerns only the surface word order. It does not deal withtheoretical assumptions concerning the underlying word order from which the surfaceword order is derived. The study of basic word order is based on the assumption thatthere is always one basic word order in all languages which is syntactically defined bythe relative order among principal constituents. This assumption generally stands exceptin the case where the word order of the language is free, is pragmatically constrained ordefined rather than syntactically based, or the appearance of both constituents (i.e.grammatical subject and object) in a clause is rare, in which case, defining any basicword order for such languages could be forced to some extent. However, as Mithun(1987) points out, “for languages with relatively rigid, syntactically defined surface wordorder, the establishment of this order at the outset has obvious utility. The description ofrarer, morphologically and pragmatically marked alternative orders as the result of themovement of constituents out of their normal position is mechanically simple.” The basicword order of a language refers to the relative order among principal constituents in oneclause. The principal constituents of a transitive clause include subject, verb and object.","[62, 63]"
"         Perfective Aspect: The simplest deictic interpretation is past, unless a word order         change (SXV word order which indicates irrealis mood) is involved, in which         case, the situation is located in the future.",[132]
"1.2.3 Iquito Orthography        The ILDP has adopted the following orthography (i.e. phonemic6) for the Iquitolanguage. In the following, I introduce first the consonants and then the vowels; thegraphemes can be written in both upper and lower case. I also include the correspondingIPA symbols between square brackets.",[31]
"        If we can consider the effect of raising and control, in the case of English, it isnoted that the big PRO actually occupy a space. Applying to the case in Iquito, however,we found out that subject control does not seem to occupy a space. For sentences (269) to(271), we might be able to give the following analyses. In (269), the subject of theinfinitival clause is present, followed by the infinitive verb, followed by the full NPobject. In (270), the subject of the infinitival clause is controlled by the principal clause;the space is not occupied; the next NP, which is indefinite, raises. In (271), the subject ofthe infinitival clause is controlled by the principal clause; the space is not occupied; thenext NP is definite, so only the determiner raises. This structure is in a sense reminiscentof a finite intransitive clause, as in (272) and (273).",[182]
"       Examples (349)-(351) are relevant cases in point. Sentence (349) conveys themeaning that ‘the object was not big and I did not buy a big one.’ Sentence (349) isincompatible with (350) which conveys the meaning that ‘the consultant does not knowthe size of the object. It may be big or not.’ Sentence (351), again, is a repetition of whatis conveyed in (349).",[224]

The seven categories include ‘inanimateindefinite,’ ‘inanimate definite,’ ‘animate indefinite,’ ‘animate definite,’ ‘personalindefinite,’ ‘personal definite’ and ‘proper name.’ These seven different categories,applying to the subject and object, generate forty-nine different expressions. The result of

the study concludes that animacy, definiteness and phrase weight do not operate on thepattern of word order in simple transitive clauses and that the basic word order of Iquitois SVO. In deciding basic word order, this chapter considers sentences containing thefollowing characteristics: independent transitive clause, affirmative, realis mood andactive voice. In addition, the subject and the object have to be expressed and representedin complete and full nominal phrases, for example, those including nouns as opposed topronouns. In Iquito, there is no agreement information (e.g. person, number, gender,class, etc.) of grammatical arguments marking on the verb, and the alignment system,based on word order, exhibits an accusative pattern. It is noted that although pronouns inIquito are not agreement inflection markers, they were excluded from the preliminarystage of investigation and the following examples do not contain them. A sentence withthe basic word order is shown as in (1). As can be seen, the relative order among theprincipal constituents in the clause is SVO.","[64, 65]"

Disjunction expresses the meaning of English or and offers alternatives, optionsor possibilities in the sentence. Subject disjunction applies at the phrasal level in threeways. First, we can place all elements together before the verb and use the singular formas the subject pronoun to indicate disjunction. The use of a singular pronoundisambiguates disjunction from conjunction in which the subject pronoun takes a pluralform to express a sense of and. Second, we can put all elements for disjunction at thebeginning of the sentence and use the word cuquisaacari ‘probably’ before one or allelements. A singular pronoun is still used before the verb. Third, we can express oneoption before the verb and displace others to the end of the sentence and connect themwith the sentence using the word cuquisaacari ‘probably.’ Disjunction of objects and                                            63
adpositional phrases works in the same way except the word cuquisaacari ‘probably’ isalways used to disambiguate it from conjunction. Also, they do not involve the form ofthe subject pronoun. Disjunction of verbs operates only at the clausal level and thereforeeach verb has to appear in different clauses. Note that speakers use the wordcuquisaacari ‘probably’ more frequently than any other alternative although somespeakers like to use phrases, such as najaaja j++ta/j++ta najaaja ‘also as,’ or najaajacuuta ‘also perhaps.’ The following schematized diagram shows all possible positions ofthe coordinator cuquisaacari ‘probably’ with respect to the coordinated phrases. Thereare two observed possibilities for the positions of the coordinator cuquisaacari‘probably.’ It can appear before all coordinated phrases simultaneously or just oncebefore the last coordinated phrase.

                                        AppendicesAPPENDIX 1: EVENT QUANTIFICATION       In many languages, event quantification is expressed through productivemorphology. In Iquito, however, it is conveyed through a set of synchronicallyunproductive derivational verbal morphemes, including -s++, -juu, -cuu, -tii, -yuu,-yuucua, among other morphemes with rarer frequency of usage. Structurally, thesemorphemes suffix directly to the verbal root and before the causative and other
derivational morphemes which precede inflectional morphemes. Currently only very fewwords containing the derivational morphemes discussed here occur with great frequencyin natural speech. The derivational morphemes in these cases encode serialization ofmultiple (i.e. mass number in this case) events conveyed by the verbal root. As theirsynchronic generalized meanings, these derivational morphemes are related with eventquantification (i.e. patterns of frequency or habituation), spatial distribution, serialization,degree of endeavor and distributive events of multiple subjects. The meanings conveyedby these derivational morphemes are prevailingly expressed through the use ofadverbials, in which case the presence of the derivational morphemes is not obligatory.","[532, 533]"

Other morphemes discussedbelow cannot be freely combined with verbal roots and hence do not have synchronicgeneral meanings.

The meanings of the underived forms and the derived formsalso generally correspond to each other in terms of the basic verbal root. Two exceptionsexist in words which contain -juu. In the pairs of words, saminiini ‘preparar’ (ENG:prepare) > saminijuuni ‘pensar’ (ENG: think), and amaniini ‘matar a varios’ (ENG: killseveral entities) > amanijuutaani ‘dar golpesitos muy suaves a un bebé para que duerma’(ENG: to pat gently on the back of a baby to facilitate his sleeping), the meanings of theunderived forms and the derived forms do not seem to relate to each other directly.

Thecombination of the above-mentioned phenomena suggests that the derivationalmorphology of -s++, -juu and -tii is not a synchronically productive one and that themorphology of -juu and -tii might be older than that of -s++.

As can be seen, verbal suffixation is the prevailing pattern in Iquito. There is only oneverbal prefix attested in Iquito, which is the anterior morpheme -(+)ta that goes with theImperfective Aspect in sentences in the Extended Current Tense to locate an imperfectivesituation prior to SpT. Tense and aspect information are conveyed by an aspect suffixfollowed by a tense suffix. Tense and aspect in Iquito are synchronically exclusivelyverbal formatives and do not attach to nouns or other parts of speech. They are boundmorphemes because they have to occur with a verb rather than as a separate word. Theyare not periphrastic expressions because the sole occurrence of an aspect suffix conveysthe aspect information. The position of aspect and tense suffixes are fixed in the verbalcomplex; therefore, they are structurally homogeneous morphological indicators, as theset of aspect suffixes form a single category within the morphological system while tensesuffixes form another. Tense and aspect information are presented, in general, as separateformatives, except in the case of -(y)aariqu+ which is a portmanteau morpheme encodingboth Imperfective Aspect and Distant Past Tense.","[290, 291]"
"There is one exception with the verb ihuiini ‘live, stage-level be’ which has locativeinterpretation in Distant Past Tense, as in (540). GNRPFV in this case presents a closedstate which no longer obtains, as in (541)-(543). Examples (540) and (541) indicate thatthe state has ended and that the subject of the sentence no longer lives in Iquitosanymore, a closed interpretation.",[309]
"       In terms of the position of tense-aspect affixes, Matthew S. Dryer (2005: 282)indicates that “morphological indicators of tense-aspect are [verbal] prefixes andsuffixes”; in addition, “there are three less common morphological ways to indicatetense-aspect,” including “tone, infixes, and stem changes.” Indeed, out of 1062 languageswith tense-aspect categories in his sample, 150 languages use prefixes, 629 use suffixes,11 use tone, 133 use combinatory strategies with none primary, and the remaining 139 donot have tense-aspect inflection (i.e. by means of separate words, auxiliary verbs, non-inflecting particles, or clitics). He further states that “for many languages, perhaps even amajority, the morphological indicators of tense-aspect on verbs are rather heterogeneousand do not form a single category within the morphological system of the language.” Inaddition, “there are also many languages which combine prefixes or suffixes with one ofthe minor strategies.”",[290]
"Moreover, when the subject is indefinite, the word order in an intransitive clause is SVinstead of VS. It is noted that the translation of subject phrase in English shows that it issemantically and syntactically indefinite in this language.

"However, they have been proposed, by some authors, to be distinct in the aspectualsystem. Tenny (1995) indicates that Motion verbs are aspectually special. Janda (2007)states that “motion verbs are prototypical in the Russian aspectual system.” In the case ofIquito, the fact that the default use of certain perfective aspects clashes with Motion verbsand coerces derived meanings, among other grammatical correlates, suggests that Motionverbs have distinct temporal schemata, which consequently constitutes a distinct situationtype. This proposal of adding Motion as a sixth situation type in Iquito is a pioneeringand preliminary one, which is still a continuing research topic.",[435]

"4.5.3 CF Wish        The third strategy expresses a past or PresCF wish. In the case of a PresCF wish,the speaker expresses a strong desire for something to be realized that is not currentlybeing realized; he wishes for something, but expects opposite to happen. In the case of apast CF wish, the speaker expresses a strong desire for something to have been realizedthat was not realized in the past. A CF wish is an internal mental activity. It can also beused in the conversation. However, no action-performing referent is obligated. Toobligate the addressee, the imperative construction or desideratives (as discussed in thischapter) are used. The sentence can only be affirmative and the person who expresses thewish can only be the speaker.",[243]
"       The imperative use of -maa could be developed either from ‘begin’ or‘remote/distance’ sense of REMPFV since the addressee is expected to begin realizingthe event for a distance while in movement as soon as he hears the imperative sentence. Itis noticed that, in Iquito, there is a directional morpheme -ma which has the senses‘towards, inside, down,’ depending on context in which it appears. It is also noted thatthere are cognate morphemes of this directional morpheme found in Andoa (Rich, 1999:75-6), meaning ‘towards, in’ and appearing both with verbs and nouns. However, I doubtthat -maa in imperative constructions is developed from the directional morpheme -mafor several reasons. First, phonologically these two morphemes have different vowellength: short vowel is devoiced and hard to hear at the end of the sentence while longvowel is clearly heard at the sentence-final position. Second, the imperative use of -maacan be developed from regular senses of REMPFV. Third, all Iquito imperatives require
                                            343
the presence of a perfective aspect. Even if it is the directional -ma here, a perfectiveaspect which will be yet another morpheme in this case will still be required. Fourth, inAndoa directional morphemes attach to both verbs and nouns while in Iquito directionalmorphemes can only attach to nouns; analyzing the imperative use of -maa here as thedirectional one would make this use the only exception that they attach to verbs. Fifth andthe last, there is another directional morpheme -cu in Iquito, which cannot be used inimperatives either. However, given the complicated origin of REMPFV -maa, I think it isworth noting the relevant observations and the comparative facts here.","[361, 362]"

The derivational morphology discussed here is adiachronically productive one, but not a synchronically productive one. Currently only afew lexicalized words, discussed in section 1, containing the derivational morphemesdiscussed here, occur with great frequency. The derivational morphemes in these casesencode serialization of multiple (i.e. a mass number in this case) events conveyed by the                                           538

Synchronically (section 2), the combinations of verbal roots and thesederivational morphemes, as non-lexicalized derived stems, are interpreted as beingrelated to event quantification (i.e. patterns of frequency or habituation), spatialdistribution, serialization, degree of endeavor and distributive events of multiple subjects.","[556, 557]"

                                 Chapter 4:       Mood4.1 INTRODUCTION       This chapter discusses grammatical expressions of mood in Iquito, with alanguage-specific focus on the realis/irrealis mood, including their morphosyntacticcharacteristics and semantic properties. I first define the term ‘mood’ used in thisdissertation and distinguish it from the term ‘modality’ as both terms are used in theliterature. I use the term mood to refer to a formally grammaticalized category which has
a modal function; therefore, it is the grammatical expression of modality in language-specific terms. Bybee, Perkins & Pagliuca (1994: 239) indicate that “mood categories are
extremely difficult and extremely interesting, as they represent long chains of diachronicdevelopments, and they interact with semantic, syntactic, and discourse parameters.","[155, 156]"
"       The X position in an intransitive clause, however, is not always filled by a lexicalelement. When it is not, vowel-hiatus resolution strategy is blocked. Iquito exhibits aphonotactic constraint against heteromorphemic vowel hiatus within a phonological

word.65 If a preverbal element is monosyllabic, it cliticizes rightward to the verbalcomplex. As a result, it is pronounced together with the verbal complex as a continuoussound stream. In a realis clause, the quality of adjacent vowels of the preverbal andverbal elements is resolved by assimilation or alteration of the vowel. Instances ofunderlying vowel hiatus are resolved by glide formation, vowel deletion, or vowel fusion,depending on the morphemes and the qualities of the vowels involved. In realis clauses,non-focal subject pronouns generally form a phonological word with their associatedverb (i.e. they behave like phonological clitics). If the verb root in question is vowel-initial, heteromorphemic vowel hiatus typically results, and one of the hiatus resolutionprocesses just mentioned takes place. In irrealis clauses, however, non-focal subjectpronouns typically do not cliticize to their associated verb. In cases in which an overtelement intervenes between the subject pronoun and the verb, the subject pronounnormally cliticizes to the intervening element, instead of to the verb. Crucially, thesubject pronoun, even if there is no intervening element (e.g. in the case of an intransitiveverb in a clause with no adjuncts), still appears not to cliticize to the verb. Specifically,the normal rules of vowel-hiatus resolution strategy are blocked, as if the subject pronounand the verb independently form separate phonological words. In slow or careful speech abrief pause may even be audible between the subject pronoun and the verb. That is to say,in the irrealis clause, it is observed that the quality of adjacent vowels remains intact, as ifthere is an implicit element in the X position that blocks the vowel hiatus.","[167, 168]"
