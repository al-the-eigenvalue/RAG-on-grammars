classification in (211), I will look here at the role of Possessives in Ostyak. The claim is that,
while lexical and ownership possessives are comparable in frequency with those in English                              forest-LOC        big               noise-EP-3SG make-NPAST-EP-3DU

and other European languages, the associative possessives are unusually frequent. This is
confirmed by the following statistics. Taylor (1991) has analyzed the corpus of English texts                  c.     o:pije:-l     lo:$-1           parkat-]                          ju:nk-e-l

type) occurred. This is equivalent, on average, to one possessive genitive every 54 words. For                        parkat-l

revealed 270 occurrences of possessive NPs, that is, every thirteenth word functions as the

         The unusually high frequency of (associative) possessives in Ostyak is due to the fact                       “Where did this man (literally: my man) come from (to me)?”
that associative possessives are in fact the only way to express the relationship between two                  e.     man-s-e-ren           ka:t a:mp.      wul a:mp     pare:m-a-s-li

        7. Relative clauses                                                                          relation borne by the subject argument of the of the participle.
        As mentioned in section 3.3.2.2, Ostyak makes use of prenominal participial relative
clauses. They are based on the so-called gap relativization strategy (Comrie 1989: 151-53),           (203) a.       (luw)      jo:s-na           u:s-e-m            mir-o-!
ie. the grammatical role of the relativized noun is not overtly indicated within the relative                        he      road-LOC _— meet-EP-PP__ people-3SG
clause. The relative clause itself, therefore, may be ambiguous, and its meaning may only be                         ‘the people he met on the road’
recoverable through the context. Thus,                                                                        b.     (nan) a:n = mij-e-m            pox-e:n e:welt

means both ‘the day my father was talking about’ and ‘the day when my father was talking’.                           ‘the forest where I got lost’
As far as my material shows, more or less every syntactic position is accessible to
telativization. This section addresses the unusual agreement pattern found in Ostyak relative

        7.1. Agreement within the relative clause
         Subject agreement patterns within relative clauses in Ostyak fall into two major types.                     muy        a:Se:-w           o:mt-e-m           xo:t-na

First, agreement may be altogether absent. As demonstrated by (201) relative clauses with a
                                                                                                                     we       father-IPL = put-EP-PP             —_ house-LOC
subject gap do not exhibit agreement. In particular, since in passive relative clauses only the
                                                                                                                     ‘in the house built by our father’
subject can be relativized, agreement fails. This is shown in (201b) where the Locative case
on the NP which corresponds to the agent argument indicates that the relative clause is
                                                                                                     If the head noun bears a possessive affix in this case, it has a possessive and non subject-
passive.

                                                                                                                  which goes back to Steinitz (1937), subdivides the Ostyak continuum into three major groups:
                                                                                                                         (i) eastern dialects (dialects of Vakh-Vasyugan, Surgut, and Salym);

                                                                                                                           The dialects vary in their degree of preservation. The southern dialects and the dialect

  than those in the north, since their homeland is a place
                                                           of active industrial development, to

 will also address the subject properties that are shared by some types of direct objects.
         First, the subject controls adverbial embedded clauses based on the Converb and the                                          me-ACC         twenty year
 purpose infinitival clause, see 3.3.2.2. In such sentences coreferentiality of subjects is                                           ‘I am twenty years old.’
 obligatory, with one exception. If the two subjects stand in the relation of inalienable
 possession coreferentiality may be violated, at least in the converbial clause, ef.:
                                                                                                                  Note that in the personal experiential construction the experiencer argument has some subject
                                                                                                                  properties, in particular, it can control the dependent clause with the Infinitive in -ti, cf.:

         Second, the subject controls zero anaphora across a conjoined clause, as shown in
 (114). Coreference with grammatical relations other than the subject is established through                              (ii) For impersonal passive constructions, see 2.2.4.3.

      3.3.1. Coordination
      As mentioned in 2.3.2, coordinating conjunctions are fairly rarely used. The most                      Disjunction is expressed by the element (a:)mola ‘or’, cf.:
common coordinative conjunction is pa ‘and, but’ used as a clausal coordinator, as shown in
(119). As a constituent coordinator it is present only in the language of the younger generation     (124)          har      sari‘  liw-e-m-na                 e:plen u:-s

attributive nouns can be structurally analyzed as a subtype of the possessive construction,            participles). In this instance they take regular inflections typical of nouns (case, number, and

non-possessive modifiers precede the head, for example: jam woj ‘nice bird’, so:rrii woj
‘golden (literally: gold) bird’, xu:/-mot iki ‘third husband’, tam xir ‘this sack’. To this type       (152)    a.     luw      ka:t ~~ wors-na           u:-l               ma      —_xu:lem-na.
