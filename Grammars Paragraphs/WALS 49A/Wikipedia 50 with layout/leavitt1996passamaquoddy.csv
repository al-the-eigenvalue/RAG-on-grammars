Passamaquoddy-Maliseet makes certain distinctions with regard to person that are
different from those made in European languages. As shown in Table I, the two               In the first sentence, wasis is proximate because it is the only third person noun. In
meanings of 'we' are distinguished, while one word means 'he or she'.                       the second sentence, the subject is third person proximate (Mali), so an animate direct
                                                                                            object must be obviative. Obviative singular nouns are marked by an -1- in the

                                                                                            Obviative plural forms are somewhat different.

Another characteristic of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet is that animate nouns and pro-
nouns (except 'I', 'we', 'you'), are marked in sentences as either proximate (i.e.,         7Le5ourd (1993a) uses an acute accent to mark a relatively high-pitched stressed syllable. A

LeSourd, how-                     Double obstruents, except -ec, also occur in word-final position: poeokk 'splat!', ntepp
ever, has shown (1993a, pp. 276 ff.) that an unstressed schwa (o) is dropped between                   'I sit in something', ktewepotoqq 'you (kif) jump up', ess 'clam', tett 'in that direction'.

exception is that unstressed schwa is not deleted between equal sonorants in word-                     where a sonorant (1, m, n, w) follows an unvoiced obstruent (he, hk, hp, hq, hs, ht22).
final syllables - wflol 'h/h tongue', nicanon 'our (nilun) child'. In words like                       The schwa (o) is always written in these syllables.

Passamaquoddy-Maliseet has words of four types: nouns, including personal names,          lique/ Angela, and Ehtiyan Etienne/Stephen. Like all borrowings, these conform to
place names, and participles used as nouns; pronouns, including personal, demon-          the phonology of the language, so that Louis becomes 6/uwi and not *Luwi, to accom-
strative, and interrogative forms and a ""hesitation"" pronoun; verbs, which are transi-    modate Passamaquoddy-Maliseet syllable and stress patterns, and Franc;ois becomes
tive or intransitive, and animate or inanimate; and particles, the only category of un-   Polansuwe, not *Plansuwe, since words do not begin with consonant-/. Many current
inflected words, including cardinal numbers, conjunctions, and adverbs. Nouns and         surnames go back to christenings by French-speaking priests, including Sockabasin,
pronouns are described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, below. Sections 4.3 through 4.7           from Jacques-Vincent; Sopiel and Sappier, from St.-Pierre; Sabattis, from Jean-
describe verbs, with attention to how verb stems are composed from various types of       Baptiste. Polchies, a common Maliseet surname, is derived from Paul, with the di-
roots and how they are inflected. Finally, Section 4.8 describes particles. (For Passa-   minutive suffix -sis: 'little Paul, son of Paul'.

Since there is no verb 'to be' in Passamaquoddy-Maliseet, identity sentences consist           tama tali koti peciye? 'where will she arrive?'
of nouns and pronouns only. Word order in identities is somewhat less free (it is
fixed in negative identities) than in sentences with verbs. Kat is the negative particle       5.2.2. Changed Conjunct
for identity sentences.

The stem -wotahsom- 'feed another from something' combines the features of stems
beginning with -wa- and those having two syllables subject to syncope.                             The last example shows the verb from which qotoput 'chair' is derived, stem -oqotop-.ut·som·a·l [w]·nican·ol emqan·sis·ok 's/he feeds h/h child from a little spoon'                    If a verb stem does not have a schwa (o) or underlying schwa in the first syllable,
originating.from-feed.TA-dir:3.Ind-obv.sg [3]-child.dep-obv.sg spoon-dim-Joe                       then the ""changed"" stem is the same as the ""unchanged"". Thus papehcimsu 's/he asks
'tahsomat ... 'if she feeds .. .'; wetsomat .. . 'when she fed .. .'                               self', papehcimsit 'when (or if) s/he asks self'; tehkepsulu 's/he hiccups', tehkepsulit
                                                                                                   'when (or if) s/he hiccups'.
Syncope occurs in some nouns: qotoput (also pronounced kutoput) 'chair', nt·oqtoput

When used in the Changed Conjunct in main clauses, certain verbs take on a
different meaning.                                                                                                                         eliphil                               eliphawan               eliphihq

 following an Imperative: ksaha naka ktopin 'come in and sit down'. Questions
 beginning with tan 'how?' also use the Subordinative. (See Section 5 for examples.)                                       Table XII.

"Passamaquoddy-Maliseet is an eastern Algonquian language, with about
500 speakers today in Maine (USA) and New Brunswick (Canada). This sketch
outlines the fundamental features of the language. Passamaquoddy-Maliseet has

five vowel sounds and twelve consonants, with pitch and stress also distinctive.
Words are composed of roots; a typical verb, for example, contains verbal,
nominal, adjectival, and adverbial roots, as well as number, tense, and other
grammatical markings. The sterns and inflections of transitive verbs are
differentiated by grammatical gender, animate or inanimate, according to that
                                                                                          Maliseet
of the direct object, while intransitive verbs agree in gender with the subject.
Other words include nouns, pronouns and uninflected particles. Particular
features of the language include the regular syncope of syllables containing
unstressed schwa, the use of absentative forms of nouns and verbs, the division
of third persons into two grammatical categories to indicate narrative focus, the
reanalysis of many participles as nouns, the marking of intransitive verbs for
use with direct objects, and speaker-centred construction of space and time.
