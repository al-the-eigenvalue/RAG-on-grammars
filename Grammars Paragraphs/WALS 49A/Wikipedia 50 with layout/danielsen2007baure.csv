Finally, there are some adverbs that occur in a further derived form in the clause: a
nominalization by means of the suffix -no ‘NOM1’, also an important derivational
suffix for adjectival bases (cf. 4.9.3). After the adverbial base lexeme there may be
another morpheme attached, such as the copula -wo and the absolutive suffix -ko.
Which purpose these derivations have remains unclear. In some cases a variety of
derived forms and the basic form is used interchangeably in the clauses. Table 8.7
gives a few examples of the mentioned derived forms:
imir          >             imirokon          (imiro-ko-no)          ‘very’
                                              very-ABS-NOM1
ihiriaw       >             ihiriawon         (ihiriawo-no)          ‘so much’
                                              so much-NOM1
tek           >             tekowon           (teko-wo-no)           ‘all’
                                              all-COP-NOM1
iherik        >             iherikowon        (iheriko-wo-no)        ‘perhaps’
                                              perhaps-COP-NOM1

8.1.5. Relation between adverb and adjective
There are no manner adverbs in Baure, but almost any adjective that refers to a qual-
ity can be used as a manner adverb. In addition to this, the manner may be expressed
via another verb in a multiple predicate construction. Adjectives used as manner ad-
verbs are henok ‘good’ and monik ‘pretty’, exemplified in (12) and (13):
(12)     nerikikoe’ moeh pihinoekoe’ henok moehkik.
         nerki-koe’   moeh pi=hino-e-ko-i’                   henok           moeh-kik
         now-EMPH CERT 2SG=see-DUR-ABS-EMPH                  good            certainly-really
         ‘Now you can really see well.’                                           [RP-N3-238]
(13)   nakiriko-ye teč čintonev novekpia monik.
       nakiroko-ye teč            činto-nev no=vek-pi-a           monik
       long.ago       DEM2m       person-PL 3PL=speak-word-LK pretty
       ‘Long ago the people spoke the Baure language very well (nicely).’
                                                                        [DC-8/3/06-17]
The close relation between adverbs and adjectives is demonstrated by the lexemes
derived from the base po- ‘other’ and a classifying element. In Table 8.3 there are a
number of temporal adverbs built on the basis of po- ‘other’, which is actually an
adjectival root. In general, the adverbial forms are fixed, whereas the adjectival forms
can be changed according to a classifier. This is e.g. the case with poiykoš ‘once’, as
demonstrated in (14):
(14)     poiykoš                  apiyok           mpoyok
         po-yoko-šo               api-yok          mpo-yok
         one-times-one            two-times        three-times
         ‘once’                   ‘twice’          ‘three times’
The forms in (14) are certainly used in adverbial phrases, but the forms are derived
from numerals (subgroup of the adjectives, cf. 4.9.1).
310                                                         BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
8.2. Articles and demonstrative pronouns or determiners
What is summed up under the term “determiners” in this grammar includes one arti-
cle, and three different kinds of demonstratives. Not included are other words like
quantifiers or numerals. In general all four determiners in Baure share many charac-
teristics, and their individual properties are difficult to determine. Therefore I will
first refer to their common characteristics before the specific character of each one is
described.
    The position of a determiner is always NP initial. This may be directly before the
noun or before one or two modifiers (of the type MOD1, cf. 4.10), as in (15):
(15)        teč            pon               činti
            DEM2m          other             person
            ‘that other person’                                                    [JC-13/7/04-59]
A determiner can also serve to trigger nominalization. This means that a modifier can
function as an NP with a determiner, and some predicates are simply marked for their
nominal character by a determiner (cf. nominalized predicates in relative clauses in
10.2). Determiners are noun class insensitive, i.e. they do not change their forms like
some modifiers do, but demonstratives are distinguished for gender and number (cf.
Table 8.8).
    All determiners can also mark an element as referential, to a certain degree202.
When an NP is used referentially, a determiner is generally obligatory. Only a few
modifiers, such as pon ‘other’ or the possessive pronouns, can sometimes mark an
NP without a preceding determiner. A determiner has the effect of individuation of
the referent. This means that certain mass nouns may occur without a determiner
when referred to generically, but they are preceded by a determiner when the referent
is individualized. However, the number of non-individuated NPs in the Baure lan-
guage is relatively small. The individualization effect is demonstrated in (17), con-
trasted with (16).

                                                                              [HC-10/8/04-18]

            ‘The plantain is already cut in halves.’                          [HC-27/7/04-80]
Determiners can be used with time adverbs and individuate them, as e.g. teč enevere
‘the next day’ in contrast with more general enevere ‘tomorrow’ (cf. 8.2.2).
Determiners are used in complex possessive (18) or partitive NPs (19). These consist
of a sequence of, generally, two NPs, of which at least the second one is marked by a
determiner (cf. 4.3.3), as demonstrated in (18) and (19):202
      In its generic interpretation, this is not true for ten/tin/to nen ‘DEM3’.

        ‘seven of the chilies’                                               [GP-N1/II-30]
All demonstratives, but not the article, can function as pronouns as well. In relative
clauses and cleft constructions all determiners can function as heads or relative pro-
nouns (cf. 10.2). The reason why to ‘ART’ is not used as an anaphoric pronoun is the
fact that it cannot be stressed and is bound to the following element like a clitic (cf.
8.2.1). Therefore clausal enclitics can also only be attached to demonstratives, but not
to the article.
    Phonologically all determiners seem to be related. Table 8.8 demonstrates the
different determiners, although their exact meaning is often unclear.

Table 8.8: The article and demonstrative pronounsAs the table shows there are dotted lines between the article and the feminine demon-
strative ti ‘DEM1f’. The Baure speakers might have partly incorporated the Spanish
article system and use ti ‘DEM1f’ like a feminine article for mainly human referents.
Meanwhile they can also use the gender neutral article to with feminine referents. In
the plural the categories article and present demonstrative are merged.
    In the singular all demonstratives are distinguished for gender, just like personal
pronouns. The feminine form is derived from the masculine form by vowel change,
e.g. teč > tič. The proximate and distal demonstratives are morphologically more
complex than the present demonstrative te/ti. The present demonstrative seems to
constitute the basic form, whereas the proximate demonstrative is supposed to have
been derived with the morpheme -čo (possibly -čo ‘NOM2’ or -čo ‘APPL’), and the
distal form with the morpheme -no (possibly -no ‘NOM1’). The morphemes attached
are mainly attached to verbs in nominalization.
    The plural forms are composed of the article and the plural demonstrative, as e.g.
to neč ‘DEM2PL’. The indefinite pronoun to ka is also marked by the article (cf.
8.3.5), possibly marking the nominal character of the pronoun. The plural forms can
only be used when the following noun is also marked for plural with the mor-
pheme -(a)nev, as shown in (20):
312                                          BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA

The following sections attempt to differentiate the meaning of the article from the
demonstrative pronouns.","[330, 331, 332, 333, 334]"
"3.8.1. Nouns
As in other languages, nouns in Baure refer to “the most time-stable concepts”
(Payne 1997:33) and are prototypically names for “persons, [animals,] places, and
things” (Schachter 1985:7). Nouns function as arguments in a clause and as heads in
head-modifier constructions. They involve the following categories: inherent gender,
number (optional), possession, inherent class, and a peripheral case (locative). Gen-
der is only apparent from related cross-reference clitics on predicates and demonstra-
tives within an NP. Number distinguishes singular (unmarked) and plural, marked by
the morphemes -nev ‘PL’ or -anev ‘hPL’ for some human nouns. Plural marking is
generally optional, but seems to be obligatory on human nouns. Possession is an im-
portant category of nouns. It divides them into bound (obligatorily possessed) and
free nouns (optionally possessed or non-possessable). The possessor is marked by a
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES                               101
personal proclitic on the noun that is possessed (head-marking). For a large number
of noun roots it is possible to derive a bound or free form by application of certain
affixes. The majority of bound nouns can also function as classifiers, in addition to
the approximately 21 grammatical classifier roots. Noun class is an inherent category
of nouns, as there is a kind of agreement marking on modifiers and incorporated into
verbs. Generally every noun is only part of one noun class and the classifier system
in Baure seems to have developed into a noun class system (cf. 4.7). An example of
an NP including classifier marking is shown in (59):
(59)   nti’ nimono te mpose senti čose.
       nti’ ni=imono te            mpo-se            senti       čo-se
       1SG 1SG=buy DEM2m three-CLF:oval              watermelon big-CLF:oval
       ‘I buy the three big watermelons.’                      [LO/GP-18/7/04-72]
Nouns are generally marked by a determiner within an NP, as te ‘DEM1m’ in (59).
The determiners consist of one article and three different demonstratives. Only a few
nouns can occur without a determiner when they refer to a mass concept.
    The locative marking on nouns referring to locations could be considered an
oblique case. However, there are no core cases in Baure, as generally semantic roles
are marked on the verb (head-marking). Specific locations are derived by compounds
of nouns with locative noun roots, as e.g. -api ‘under’ in (60):
(60)   mesi-ye          mesapi-ye
       mesi-ye          mes-api-ye
       table-LOC        table-under-LOC
       ‘on the table’   ‘under the table’
Some other morphemes that are frequently, but not exclusively, attached to nouns are
diminutive -či and augmentative -ča, distributive -he, emphatic -i’, and the clausal
enclitics. Compounding is an important process for deriving new nouns.
    Nouns may also function as predicates in a clause, as non-verbal predicates. The
distinction between verbs and non-verbal predicates is indispensable: The subject of a
non-verbal base is marked by an enclitic, whereas all verbs have subject marking by a
proclitic. This is contrasted in (61) and (62):
(61)   nka peronowoni!
       nka pero-no-wo=ni
       NEG    be.lazy-NOM1-COP=1SG
       ‘I am not a lazybones!’
(62)   naperow.
       ni=apero-wo
       1SG=be.lazy-COP
       ‘I am lazing around.’
Nominal morphology and the classifier system are described in detail in Chapter 4,
and the description of non-verbal predicates is discussed in Chapter 5. Therefore the
term “predicates” is used when referring both to verbs and non-verbal predicates and
102                                          BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
“predicate phrase” when referring to verb phrases and phrases headed by non-verbal
predicates.","[122, 123, 124]"
"3.8.3. Adjectives
Adjectives are “words denoting qualities or attributes” (Schachter 1985:13). Their
main function is to modify nouns. Baure has adjectives, but it is difficult to decide if
they really constitute a separate word class. Adjectives are all nominal. They can un-
dergo all nominal morphology and function as modifiers in an NP. Some nouns can
also function as modifiers, but adjectives predominantly serve this purpose. Dixon
acts on the assumption that “all languages have a distinguishable adjective class”
(Dixon 2004:9). He argues that there are languages with adjectives that are similar to
verbs, and languages with noun-like adjectives (Dixon 2004:12). Baure belongs to
the second type. In Baure there are also a large number of stative verbs, which are
translated as adjectives into English, as e.g. -topok- ‘be dirty’ in (66):
(66)   rotopokow te hikoč.
       ro=topoko-wo          te        hikoč
       3SGm=be.dirty-COP DEM1m         knife
       ‘The knife is dirty.’                                          [HC-16/8/03-15]
104                                         BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
These verbs are definitely not part of the adjectives but of the class of verb. They are
bound forms with subject procliticization (ro- ‘3SGm’ in (66)) and verbal morphol-
ogy.
    It is much more difficult to distinguish adjectives from nouns. The problems for
the distinction are: adjectives are frequently identical to heads in an NP; nouns can
function as modifiers as well; adjectives take more or less all the nominal morphol-
ogy; there is not only one modifier position within an NP, but two.
    Example (59) above showed how modifiers may occur in an NP and modify the
head noun. However, more frequently, the head noun has been omitted in Baure, and
the modifier makes up the complete head (as mentioned by Dixon 2004:23), as in
(67):
(67)   te čose račkow in apo marok.
       te         čo-se           ro=ačko-wo          in    apo      marok
       DEM1m      big-CLF:oval 3SGm=be.full-COP       water or       chicha
       ‘This big glass is full of water or chicha.’                    [MD-8/8/03-61]
The NP te čose ‘the big glass’ is an elliptical expression and is only interpreted as
referring to the glass because the speaker is pointing at it, or he mentioned it before.
In other contexts čose can refer to big watermelons, boats, bottles or other items
(compare to (59) above). This shows very well that the NP is anaphoric and only
definite because of the preceding context. The real head to was ‘the glass’ has been
omitted and must be inferred. In Tariana (North Arawak) as well, “any adjective can
be used without a nominal head in a noun phrase” (Aikhenvald 2004:106).
    Some nouns also function as modifiers in an NP, but the number is very re-
stricted. These are mainly hir ‘man, male’, eton ‘woman, female’, and some other
generic nouns, like e.g. -per ‘domesticated animal’.
    The different positions of an adjective within an NP are related to the morpho-
logical class the adjective belongs.
    Even if adjectives in Baure share many properties with nouns and even a few with
verbs, they are also different for certain semantic and morphological reasons. The
most prototypical semantic fields associated with adjectives are dimension, age,
value and colour, as argued in Payne (1997:65) and Dixon (2004:3–4). These seman-
tic classes are almost entirely expressed by adjectives of the morphological class I
(with colour as an exception). Adjectives of class I are right-bound morphemes that
usually attach to a bound noun root or classifier, as čo- ‘big’ in (67). Adjectives of
class II are absolute forms, which means, they remain in an unchangeable form and
do not get a classifier attached. An example is given in (68):
(68)   tin monči monik
       tin         monči     moni-ko
       DEM3f       child     pretty-ABS
       ‘that pretty girl’                                              [JC-13/8/03-99]
Adjectives of class III are all derived forms. They resemble nouns and nominalized
verbs mostly. Classifiers can be incorporated into many of these derived forms. Col-
our terms are part of class III. One example with an incorporated classifier is (69):
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES                               105
(69)   paš ka’an moseran
       p-a-š              ka’an        moser-a-no
       one-CLF:animal-one animal       red-CLF:animal-NOM1
       ‘one red animal’                                              [MD-7/8/03-18]
The numerals and the word for ‘other’ (po-CLF) are morphologically part of the ad-
jective classes. They are also right-bound roots to which classifiers or bound noun
roots attach.
    Adjectives of class I are rather used for modification, but may also be used as
predicates. Adjectives of class II are mainly used predicatively. Adjectives of class
III are used for both.
    The main position for a modifying adjective in an NP is following the head noun.
Class III adjectives always follow the noun. Class I adjectives also follow the head
noun, except for numerals (cf. (69)) and po- ‘other’. Class II adjectives may precede
or follow the head noun.
    When used as predicates, adjectives are non-verbal predicate bases, just like
nouns. The subject is referred to by an enclitic, as in (70):
(70)   ver anewapani.
       ver    ane-wapa=ni
       PERF old-COS=1SG
       ‘I am already old/ an old person.’                            [JC-13/8/03-95]
Adjectives are like nouns in many respects, but they also have some properties in
common with verbs. Even though not used like verbs (not even when predicates),
some verbal morphemes that do not attach to nouns, can be attached to adjectives.
These are the approximative -so, and the quality nominalizer -pi ‘QNOM’, and pro-
ductive reduplication for marking intensity.
   Adjectives of class II and III may also modify verbs. They do so with predicative
adjectives mainly (comparable to other predicate chains, (71)), but also simple un-
marked forms modify verbs, as illustrated in (72):
(71)   nka henowaperi riyonop.
       nka heno-wapa=ri ri=yono-po
       NEG      good-COS=3SGf 3SGf=walk-PRFLX

Adverbs “function as modifiers of constituents other than nouns” (Schachter
1985:20). Semantically they “cover an extremely wide range of concepts” (Payne
1997:69). Just as Payne noted, adverbs are a “catch-all” category (1997:69). All those
words have been assigned to this class that are lexical, free morphemes that refer to
106                                                   BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
the place or time of an event. In addition there are many other words in this class
referring to the aspect, epistemic evaluation, mode, intensity or quantity of an event.
The class of adverbs is semi-closed. Some subclasses are very small and closed, such
as place adverbs, and others are larger, such as temporal adverbs.
    The morphology of adverbs does not distinguish them much from other word
classes. The adverb class is too heterogeneous to assign the same morphological
properties to all adverbs. Some basic adverbs are monomorphemic, but others may
show fossilized internal morphology. Some adverbs have been derived from verbs,
some of them by nominalization. Some temporal adverbs also occur with a deter-
miner. Thus there are some adverbs that are similar to nouns.
    Particles is the cover term, which includes adverbs, preverbal particles, interjec-
tions, and a few other specific forms, referred to in 3.8.7 below.
    Especially time words are difficult to assign either to the class of nouns or to the
adverb class, as some of them may occur with a determiner. The words roseskoner
‘day’ and yotoer ‘night’ are presumably nouns, as they can occur with a determiner.
However when they occur together with a determiner, they usually constitute an ad-
verbial phrase, as in (73):
(73)     nowoyikow asaw nonik to yotoer.
         no=woyiko-wo asaw               no=nik to          yotoer
         3PL=make-COP fried.meat         3PL=eat ART night
         ‘They are preparing fried meat for them to eat at night.’                         [RP-N4-266]
In very few examples roseskoner ‘day’ and yotoer ‘night’ can actually be used as
arguments, for which reason they are rather analyzed as nouns. Words that occur with
a determiner but are never used as arguments but as adjuncts in a clause are assigned
to the adverb class. Adverbs also differ from nouns because they cannot be plural-
ized, as shown in (74) with different adverbs:
(74)     *nakanev, *nokopenev, *napirinev, *mohinev, *tekonev
         naka-nev      nokope-nev     napiri-nev    moeh-nev     teko-nev
         over.there-PL day.before-PL  also-PL       certainly-PL all-PL
Place adverbs do not get the locative -ye suffixed like nouns:
(75)     *naka-ye,                  *noiy-ye,             (*)ne-ye101
         over.there-LOC             there-LOC             here-LOC
However, there is one temporal adverb, used in narratives, which has been lexicalized
including the locative suffix: nakirok-ye ‘once upon a time, long ago’.
    Many bound nominal roots form compounds or are incorporated. This is not ob-
served with adverbs.
    Some adverbs can also be used as non-verbal predicates with predicate morphol-
ogy and argument marking, as in (76) and (77):101
    It seems to be possible to use ne-ye in songs only, as a kind of place pronoun, but this construction has
probably been used for the matter of rhyme and rhythm.

       ‘Maybe it (the food) is already ready, it is already cooked.’    [MD-2/8/04-17]
Some preverbal particles have been derived from adverbs, but the preverbal particles
have a fixed position in relation to the predicate, whereas adverbs do not.
    Adverbs are mainly different from other constituents in a clause because of their
relatively free positioning. Most of the adverbs are clausal adjuncts and occur clause
initially or clause finally, but they may also occur in other positions, e.g. preceding or
following a predicate they refer to.
    One important function of temporal adverbs is the disambiguation of a clause in
respect to time reference. Verbs do not have a tense category. Therefore, temporal
adverbs function to specify time, as contrasted in (78) and (79):
(78)   a. nka nčowor.            b. yimirokon nka nčowor.

Adverbs of intensity and quantity are for example imir ‘very’ and maiy ‘much’, but
the same forms are used to modify nouns, which means that these forms could be
considered adjectival homomorphs:

"2.5.4. Metathesis
There are mainly two types of metathesis in Baure: one is a phonological process of a
syllable and the other one derivational. Both types are contact metathesis, i.e. a mor-
pheme of CV is inverted into VC under certain conditions. The phonological process
mainly concerns the syllables /ji/ and /hi/, which are turned around if word finally or
in fast speech. Words ending in /ji/ and /hi/, where the final /i/ does not carry stress,
invert these syllables and create a type of diphthong with the vowel of the preceding
syllable (compare 2.1.2). This type of metathesis is schematized in Figure 2.3 and
exemplified below:
C1V1C2V2            → C1V1V2C2            where V1= /a/, /o/, /e/
                                                V2= /i/
                                                C2= /j/, /h/
Figure 2.3: Metathesis in BaureFigure 2.3 shows that the syllable C2V2 is inverted into V2C2 if V1 is not a high vowel
and V2 is the high vowel, so that the two vowels V1V2 can create a closing diphthong.
C2 has to be the glide /j/ or the fricative /h/. The examples of the isolated words with
word final metathesis will be contrasted with the plural forms of the words in which
the inverted syllables occurs in the original CV order:
(173) nipoiy ‘my foot’    → nipoyinev ‘my feet’
(174) ni’aiy ‘my brother’ → ni’ayinev ‘my brothers’
(175) poeh91 ‘duck’       → pohinev ‘ducks’
In (175) metathesis has even caused assimilation of the vowel /i/ and the diphthong
/oe/ results from the two adjacent vowels. There is another metathesis of a vowel and
a glide, which only occurs after the vowel /i/: a word final /i/ that gets the copula suf-
fix -wo attached leads to metathesis of the copula and creates a triphthong type (b)
(cf. 2.1.2) in the form -iow (-i + -wo), as represented in the following example:
(176) tiow
      ti-wo
      DEM1f-COP
      ‘this is’
In fast speech this type of metathesis can be observed more frequently with some
other verbal suffixes, as e.g. with -pa ‘GO’ in the following examples:
(177) nkačpa        → nkačap92
      ni=kač-pa
      1SG=go-GO
      ‘I am going to go’91
     This lexeme was written as pohi by d’Orbigny (1845:117), and in Trinitario the word is pohi as well.
92
     The expression nkačap ‘I am going to go’ is used for a general ‘goodbye’.
CHAPTER 2 - PHONOLOGY                                                                75
(178) nimokpa       → nimokap
      ni=imok-pa
      1SG=sleep-GO
      ‘I am going to sleep’
Sometimes metathesis may be caused by the syllable pattern and stress rules. Here it
can be noticed that the verb base final absolute suffix -ko may lead to metathesis
when preceded by /i/. In the metathesis the /i/ is then changed into the position that
directly follows the consonant /k/ of the absolute suffix. This only happens optionally
when certain morphemes follow, mainly those that contain the vowel /a/. Compare
the following examples in which this type of metathesis can be observed in the sec-
ond example, but not in the first:
(179) a. risapikoper          →        b. risapkiwaner
         ri=sapiko-pa=ro                  ri=sapiko-wana=ro
         3SGf=poke-GO=3SGm                3SGf=poke-DEP=3SGm
         ‘she went to poke him’           ‘she poked him and left’     [GP-N1/II-17]
Many more cases of metathesis can be observed in derivation. It has been observed in
compounds that the second noun or classifier can be changed by metathesis:
(180) siporan            <      sipor + na’
      ‘austrich egg’            austrich egg
Furthermore metathesis was found among alienable-inalienable stem derivations.

         pi=niko-ri                      nikiro-ko

The morphophonological changes in this section only concern a specific type of en-
clitics: the personal cross-reference enclitics, used for object reference on verbal
predicates. The personal proclitics have already been mentioned in this chapter, as
some of them drop a vowel and cause e.g. voicing of a stem-initial consonant (cf.
2.5.1). But besides the already described processes there are no drastic changes in
form of the proclitics. The enclitic forms, on the other hand, change their forms when
attaching to certain morphemes. The changes are phonologically conditioned, but
they can only be observed with the enclitics and not when homophonous verbal suf-
fixes attach in the same slot. One type of change only concerns the third person encli-
tics. This type will be shown first. Another change only concerns the 2SG enclitic,
described further below.
76                                                       BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
The underlying forms of the third person clitics are -ro ‘3SGm’, -ri ‘3SGf’, and -no
‘3PL’93. Word finally, the morphemes with the vowel /o/ show vowel elision when
attached, the morpheme with the vowel /i/ (-ri ‘3SGf’) palatalizes the rhotic. The
phonological change that is specific for these enclitics occurs when they are attached
to any verbal morpheme that ends in /a/, and also to some others containing the
vowel /o/, as e.g. -’ino ‘SUBJ’, -no ‘NOM1’, -čo ‘APPL’ or ‘NOM2’. The list of mor-
phemes where the change occurs appears to be so long that it is easier to say where it
does not occur: after the copula morpheme -wo and the perfective morpheme -po. To
start with I will give one example and explain the phonological change with the help
of it. Regard the personal enclitic -no ‘3PL’ in (183) and compare the underlying
forms in the second line:
 (183) a. pivekon.                         compare:          b. pivekien
          pi=veko-no                                            pi=veko=no
          2SG=speak-NOM1                                        2SG=speak=3PL
          ‘your speaking’                                       ‘you speak to them’
Underlyingly both examples show the same forms, but there is no sound change ob-
served when the nominalizing suffix -no is attached directly to the verb -vek(o)-
‘speak’, whereas the form of the personal enclitic -no ‘3PL’ changes together with the
verb final syllable -ko into -kien instead of -kon. Both the nominalizing suffix and the
clitic have the underlying form -no, but in the attachment of the clitic there is a vowel
change from -o (in -ko) to the vowel -e, which then causes the palatalization and oc-
curs as -ie in -kien. Depending on the type of consonant of the last syllable this pala-
talization occurs or does not occur. It mainly occurs with the velar plosive /k/. A final
morpheme -pa ‘GO’ changes into -pen when the enclitic for 3PL is attached. The same
sound change can be observed with the clitic -ro ‘3SGm’. The form of the verb would
then be pivekier ‘you speak to him’ (compare (183)b). The feminine enclitic -ri
‘3SGf’ changes into two different forms: mainly after -ko it attaches as -kiri, but after
other morphemes as e.g. -pa ‘GO’ it is -peri. On account of this and all the other
sound changes in a phonological word, the representation of the examples will al-
ways include a line that shows the underlying form. This sound change is also ob-
served when the enclitic is attached to the verb stem directly. Here is a list of the
sound changes n combination with the different morphemes:
-ša     +       -ro = -šer            -ša     +     -ri = -šeri            -ša     +   -no = -šen
-pa +           -ro = -per            -pa     +     -ri = -peri            -pa +       -no = -pen
-ko     +       -ro = -kier           -ko     +     -ri = -kiri            -ko     +   -no = -kien
-pik(o) +       -ro = -pikier         -pik(o) +     -ri = -pikiri          -pik(o) +   -no = -pikien
-čo     +       -ro = -čer            -čo     +     -ri = -čeri            -čo     +   -no = -čen
-iyo +          -ro = -iyer           -iyo +        -ri = -iyeri           -iyo +      -no = -iyen
-wana +         -ro = -waner          -wana +       -ri = -waneri          -wana +     -no = -wanen
-ino +          -ro = -iner           -ino +        -ri = -ineri           -ino +      -no = -inen93
     For a complete description of personal clitics cf. Chapter 8 and Table 8.9.
CHAPTER 2 - PHONOLOGY                                                                      77
The sound change that concerns the 2SG enclitic -pi is a fusion with the word final
copula suffix -wo into the form -vi (< -wo + -pi). Sometimes the copula morpheme is
not fused but the sound change occurs nonetheless, which is then the form -wovi
(< -wo + -pi). In many cases it cannot be argued definitely that the fusion of the two
morphemes took place at all and that the copula morpheme is existent underlyingly.
This is because the copula very often does not change the meaning of the verb a lot
and a verb can be used alternatively without it in many examples. When asked in
elicitation the speakers are generally not aware of an underlying morpheme and give
the other forms with the different persons without the copula in a paradigm. Finally,
the changed form -vi for 2SG is frequently co-existent in use with the original under-
lying form -pi. What is especially striking is that by changing its form like that the
enclitic becomes ambiguous and may refer to 2SG (underlyingly (-wo)-pi) or 1PL,
which is underlyingly -vi. Here is an example that shows this type of sound change
and the ambiguity:
(184) a. rimokokavi                compare: b. rimokokavi
         ri=imo-koka-wo=pi                     ri=imo-koka=vi
         3SGf=CAUS-laugh-COP=2SG               3SGf=CAUS-laugh=1PL
         ‘she is making you laugh’             ‘she is making us laugh’
In another example a speaker told me there was a difference in meaning when the
copula is added or not, but this would not be confirmed by all other speakers:
(185) a. ver nčinčpavi              compare: b. ver nčinčpapi
         ver ni=činč-pa-wo=pi                   ver ni=činč-pa=pi
         PERF 1SG=understand-GO-COP=2SG         PERF 1SG=understand-GO=2SG
         ‘I already understand you’             ‘I already understood you’
In (185)a the word final form -vi can be analyzed as the fusion of the two mor-
phemes, the copula -wo and the 2SG enclitic -pi. The example in (185)b shows the
lack of the form change and the speaker argues that there is the difference in meaning
that the b-example refers to the past. It is difficult to decide if the analysis is correct,
as the speakers all speak fluent Spanish and wish to have two different forms in
Baure where they are different in Spanish, especially when referring to tense differ-
ences. I am not all too sure if this is correct, but it may still be the case that the copula
morpheme is there underlyingly when the sound change occurs and if it is absent, as
in (185)b the sound change does not occur.
     On the other hand there are also examples of the applicative -čo that changes due
to vowel harmony into -či where the enclitic form is -vi ‘2SG’ (-čivi < -čo + -pi).
There it could also be argued that an underlying copula first changed the enclitic into
the form -vi (-čo + -wo + -pi > -čo + -vi > -čivi) and only thereafter the vowel har-
mony is activated. There is no solution to this as the speakers’ data is not always as
definite and clear as a linguist may wish, and speakers may apply a rule only some-
times and may or may not be aware of the rule or the underlying forms.
     None of the enclitics seem to change their form if they are the second of two en-
clitics in double object marking.

2.6. The phonological phrase
Some of the (morpho-)phonological processes that have been described are not re-
stricted to word boundaries, but can occur between words as well within a phono-
logical unit, called the phonological phrase. This seems to be a characteristic of Ara-
wak languages in general (e.g. Pet 1979 on Lokono, Aikhenvald 1996 on Bare and
1998 on Warekena). A phonological phrase is not such a fixed unit as a phonological
word and it depends on the speed of utterance. In normal speed or precise speech or
in elicitation words occur in isolation, the phonological boundaries are generally
identical to the word boundaries. But the faster it is spoken the more words can be
bound into one phonological phrase, which can be identical with a syntactic unit, the
clause, but does not have to be necessarily. The phonological phrase shows one sus-
tained pitch and generally one primary stress (as already argued by Pet 1979:325 for
what he calls “pause group”). Because of the prosodic dependency of the phonologi-
cal phrase all my data and all the examples are represented with the isolated forms,
the phonological words, but in this section I will show which phonological processes
may occur in a phonological phrase. Some of these processes only occur in the pho-
nological phrase, such as consonant drop.
    Starting with the processes that have been described, one of the most prominent
processes in the phonological phrase is vowel elision (cf. 2.2.1). As mentioned in
2.4.2, a monosyllabic word always attaches to another word, as e.g. the article to. In
the following example of a short phonological phrase it can be observed that the arti-
cle to even drops its vowel and the consonant /t/ phonetically attaches to the preced-
ing word:
(186) [ngawapat ss]         /nkawapat ses/
      nkawapa to ses
      nka-wapa       to    ses
      NEG-COS        ART   sun
      ‘There is no sun any more.’                                        [IS-12/4/03-16]
The same elision in this monosyllabic word can be observed in the frequently used
expression nka to ka ‘there is nothing/no-one who’. This is shown in (187):
(187) [ngat ka ask]     /nkat ka askoni/
      nka to ka askoni
      nka to         ka    asko=ni
       NEG    ART     IND  help=1SG
       ‘There is no-one who helps me.’                            [LO/GP-15/7/04-156]
It is possible that stress shifts when vowels are deleted, and stress may even fall on a
syllable that is not realized in the word in isolation, a syllable that actually forms the
boundary between two words. This is shown in the following phonological phrase:
(188) [worapiktsown]       /worapikot sowon/
      worapik to sowon
      worapik        to    sowon
      PERF.COME      ART   rain
      ‘The rain already comes (in rainy season).’                        [IS-12/4/03-18]
CHAPTER 2 - PHONOLOGY                                                                  79
In isolation the stress would fall on -pik in the word worapik ‘already come’. Exam-
ple (188) shows that the stress of the whole phrase has shifted to the following closed
syllable, which consists of the last consonant of the word worapik, then an additional
vowel (which may or may not be the underlying final /o/ which was deleted94), and
the consonant of the article word to, of which the vowel has been deleted. This effect
can also be observed with personal proclitics. They are syntactically part of the fol-
lowing base they are attached to in isolation, but in a phonological phrase, the clitic
may phonetically attach to the preceding word. This is demonstrated in the following
two examples:
(189) [rkatpoworpnije]      /rokatpoworpenije/
      rokačpow ropeni-ye
      ro=kač-po-wo            ro=peni-ye
      3SGm=go-PRFLX-COP 3SGm=cave-LOC
      ‘He went away into his cave.’                                       [RP-N2/I-34]
                  j   j
(190) [atir k etœrowin]        /atiri kietoerovin/
      ač rikietoerovin?
      ač      ri=kie-toero=vi-no
      and 3SGf=EV-do.how-COP-NOM1
      ‘And what is she doing to us (lit. how is she doing us)?’         [AD/DC-D2-1]
In both examples a proclitic is phonetically attached to the preceding word. In (189)
it is the proclitic ro- ‘3SGm’, which refers to the possessor of the following noun, in
(190) it is ri- ‘3SGf’, which refers to the subject of the following verb. Interestingly,
the morphemes to which the clitics phonetically attach obey the same attachment
rules as they have been argued for enclitics in 2.5.6.
     It has been shown in 2.2.1 that word final vowels /o/ and /i/ are dropped when the
words occur in isolation. It is possible that these vowels reoccur in a phonological
phrase. The vowel is used to bind one word to the following, which is not always
possible with two consonants. This can be observed in (188) and (189). In both ex-
amples the word final vowel /o/ that is generally dropped in isolation, as it can be
seen by the orthographic representation, occurs in order to bind the following word
phonetically. In (190) the vowel /i/ occurs after the word ač ‘and’. But is this really
the underlying vowel of the word ač ‘and’? Not necessarily, because the vowel in
between two words is not always an underlying vowel of the word itself, but rather a
kind of epenthetic vowel. In many cases this epenthetic vowel is flexible and obeys
vowel harmony rules, i.e. the vowel that appears between the two words depends on
the vowel of the following syllable. Therefore we can also find [ate] or [ato] in
certain other examples. Another word, the verb and preverbal particle kač ‘go’ is
used to demonstrate this vowel harmony again:
94
     This vowel at word boundaries is also sometimes pronounced [a].

When there are two vowels coming together in a phonological phrase, the same rules
may apply as in the morphophonology (2.5.2). Here is an example where a diphthong
results from two vowels at word boundaries:
(194) [nihink toemi]            /nihinok toemi/
      nihinok to imi
      ni=hinok        to      imi

In (194) the article to attaches to the following noun imi ‘tajibo (tree sp.)’, which is
vowel initial and the two vowels /o/ + /i/ result in the diphthong /oe/, just as it has
been described for morpheme boundaries (2.5.2).
    When words are bound phonetically we can also observe the loss of consonants.
Mainly it is one of two identical consonants, and the rhotic /r/ is frequently lost in
specific combinations. Here are two examples of the drop of /r/:
(195) [vrpen]            /verepen/
      ver repen.
      ver    ro=epen

In (195) the two adjacent rhotics fuse into one ambisyllabic /r/, whereas the rhotic of
the word ver ‘already’ in (196) is lost completely in favour of the following conso-
CHAPTER 2 - PHONOLOGY                                                                    81
nant cluster. The consonant cluster of the nasal and the voiced plosive may also be
the reason why the preceding consonant /r/ has to be dropped; it would be the third
consonant in a sequence, and generally consonant clusters are not favoured (cf.
2.4.1). This process cannot really be observed on any other than on the level of the
phonological phrase.
    In 2.5.1 it was shown that non-continuant consonants get voiced after a nasal with
certain restrictions (cf. Table 2.12). This process can be observed between words
when the nasal /n/ and the plosive /t/ are adjacent, but in no other case. This voicing
effect in a phonological phrase can be noticed in the following two examples:
(197) [knd pikmrik]          /konto pikomorik/
      kon to pikomorik?

Example (198) is a good overview of a number of processes that can be observed in a
phonological phrase: vowel elision of the vowel /i/ in poekiš [pok] ‘one (con-
tents)’, epenthesis of the vowel /o/ in between the two words poekiš hokon
[pokhkn], or metathesis of the first syllable of hokon [()hkn] ‘basket’, voicing
of the word initial plosive /t/ of the article to, and finally word final aspiration of ka-
hap [kahaph] ‘manioc’. This aspiration is one of the definite signs for the end of a
phonological phrase: only the final consonant of the phonological phrase can be aspi-
rated.
3. Morphological processes and word classes
Baure is a polysynthetic, incorporating, agglutinative, and head-marking language
(Sapir 1921, Comrie 1989, Croft 2003, Nichols 1986). Words can consist of up to
nine morphemes with one, two or more lexical roots, as in (1):
(1)      pehmoekpoeiyin-niš?
         pi=eh-mo-i-ko-pa-yi-no=niš
         2SG=wash-CLF:woven-DUR-ABS-GO-LOC-NOM1=EXCLA
         ‘Where are you going to wash clothes then?’                                    [DC-8/3/06-73]
The word in (1) consists of a person proclitic, a verb root, an incorporated classifier
(second lexical root), five suffixes, and a clausal enclitic. This is what traditionally
has been called polysynthetic: “to combine a large number of morphemes, be they
lexical or grammatical, into a single word, corresponding to a sentence of English”
(Comrie 1989:45). In a spot check in narratives (1583 words) the ratio was 2,74
(4201 total) morphemes per word95. The ratio is relatively low because there are so
many (monomorphemic) preverbal particles (cf. 7). These particles tend to replace
verbal suffixes. This may suggest a development of Baure into a more analytic lan-
guage, possibly under the influence of Spanish. Originally Baure may have been
more synthetic, as the typology particularly of the southern group of the Arawak lan-
guage family suggests (Aikhenvald 1999:86, 2001:171). Only taking the verbs of
these texts into account the ratio becomes 4,38 morphemes per verb.
    Along with argument marking by cross-referencing clitics on verbs there is also
incorporation of noun roots and classifiers into verbs and other constituents. These
incorporated roots either refer to an argument of a situation or some other element
involved. Both argument-marking and incorporation lead to the morphological com-
plexity. Further we can detect compounding of noun roots, classifiers, and even
grammatical morphemes into fixed units.
    The degree of fusion is extremely low in Baure. Very few morphemes refer to
more than one grammatical category, such as e.g. the personal clitics, which denote
person, gender (only 3SG) and number. As (1) illustrates, each morpheme generally
has one meaning, and morphemes are separable.
    The term head-marking has been coined by Nichols (1986): syntactic relations are
morphologically marked on the head rather than on the dependent of a phrase. Exam-
ples are the marking of the possessed noun by a possessor proclitic, the argument
marking on verbs, and the additional manipulation of the semantic roles of these ar-
guments by causative, benefactive and applicative marking on verbs. There are no
core cases in Baure, only locative nouns are marked by a locative suffix, a possible
instance of dependent-marking.
    If we take argument cross-referencing clitics as inflectional, Baure is a pro-drop
language, in which explicit arguments are frequently omitted. In narratives the sub-
ject proclitics, mainly for 3SGm, but also incidentally 3SGf, are omitted when topical.","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]"
"10.1.10. The connector moena’ ‘before that’
The basis of the connector moena’ ‘before that’ was the verb -ina- ‘be of use, use’.
The privative prefix mo- was attached and the direct translation of the particle would
be ‘(be of) no use’. The verb without the privative prefix is sometimes used in order
to express an instrumental meaning ‘with’ in a serial construction, as in (40):
(40)   roepkiekier roena’ to yakis.
       ro=ipkieko=ro ro=ina’             to      yakis
       3SGm=kill.by.hit 3SGm=use ART stick
       ‘He killed it with a stick (using a stick).’                      [RP-6/7/04-59]
The connector moena’ ‘before that’ is a kind of negative consecutive, as it means that
something is done or should be done so that something else does not happen, or be-
fore it happens (41). It is sometimes used in the short form na’ (42).

       ‘Come down before you fall down!’                               [RP-19/4/06-39]
The translation of moena’ as ‘before that’ goes back to the Spanish equivalent antes
que and is meant to distinguish the particle from a possible temporal particle or ad-
verb ‘before’. The particle moena’ could also be translated as ‘not that … happens’,
and it occurs frequently in a warning without a direct connection to a preceding
clause, as the excerpt from a conversation in (43) shows:
(43)   nka henowapapowor to kaya-ye. moena’ vikaširopoek apo vihevipoekop.
       nka heno-wapa-po-wo=ro            to      kaya-ye

       Beware/Not that we slip or fall down.’                  [DC-22/3/06-14/15]
Even though moena ‘before that’ may introduce a consecutive clause itself, it can
also be found in addition to the causal connector koeč ‘because’, as demonstrated in
(44):
(44)   nikonokier koeč moena’ nemoro’in.
       ni=konoko=ro         koeč      moena’           ni=emoro’in

       ‘I wrote it down because before I forget it.’                   [DC-10/4/06-49]10.1.11 The connector iškon ‘until’
The connective particle iškon ‘until’ is in fact the nominalized form of the verb -iško-
‘(go, do) until’. It may be surprising that the meaning ‘until’ is generally expressed
by a verb, but this is much more common in Baure than the form iškon as a connec-
tor. However, it seems to be a perfect direct translation of Spanish hasta ‘until’ and is
found more and more in the most recent data. Maybe I have also encouraged that by
priming speakers using it myself as a more familiar construction. Older speakers fa-
vour the use of the verbal construction, as shown in (45):
(45)   viškopoekoe’ noiy riweri-ye koeč to sowon, vipikow to sowon.
       vi=iško-pa-ikoe’     noiy ri=weri-ye         koeč       to   sowon

How iškon ‘until’ combines two clauses is shown in (46):
(46)    kač risapkiwaner iškon rikomorikier ač rivier.
        kač ri=sap-ki-wana=ro                 iškon ri=ikomoriko=ro        ač

        ‘She went to poke him (the eel) in the hole, until she killed him and took him

Sometimes the connector is combined with the complementizer as iškon apo ‘until
that’, which is the method how an adverb takes a complement. The description of
iškon ‘until’ can be taken as a representation of the way adverbs are used in clause
combining. On the scale of the continuum between grammatical connector of clauses
and adverbs, iškon shall rather be settled closer towards the lexical category. I sug-
gest a scale of the mentioned elements of this section as shown in Figure 10.2:
grammatical                                                                     lexical

Figure 10.2: Degrees of grammaticalization of connectors in 10.1Finally, I want to mention that the adverb or particle ver ‘PERF/already’ can very of-
ten be used as a kind of neutral connector, where the speaker wants to identify the
separateness of two clauses. By marking a predicate, which is preceded by a predi-
cate, with ver ‘PERF/already’ separates this predicate from the other one, because in a
chain of multiple predicates ver as a preverbal particle would occur only once at the
beginning of the predicate chain. Sometimes ver replaces the complementizer apo ‘if,
that’ and others. There is one example in (47):
(47)    nti’ nihinokowor ver rampik kahap.
        nti’ ni=hinoko-wo=ro ver           ro=am-pik kahap
        1SG 1SG=see-COP=3SGm PERF 3SGm=bring-COME manioc
        ‘I have seen that he brought manioc.’             [HC-8/3/06-69]10.2. Relative clauses and other subordinate clauses
In this section subordination strategies in Baure are described, which include what is
generally referred to as relative clauses. The predicate in the subordinate clause is
transformed into a nominal by different processes. The types of nominalization men-
398                                         BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
tioned in this section have been discussed in 5.2.4. There are participant, action, and
product nominalizations, by which a nominal is derived from a verb. Further there is
quality nominalization, which derives an abstract noun from attributive modifier
nouns (adjectives, cf. 4.9.5). In addition there are two more specific forms of subor-
dinate marking: locative and temporal marking. Each type of derivation forms a dif-
ferent kind of relative or subordinate clause. Structurally all these subordinate clauses
are almost identical.
     Turning now to other related constructions, the cleft construction with tiow ‘this
is’ is a specific type of construction for turning the focus on an element in the clause.
The cleft particle tiow is always followed by a relative clause, in which the predicate
occurs in a subordinate position. Nearly all of the major interrogative constructions
consist of a specific kind of relative clause. Relative clauses are finally compared to a
simple juxtaposition of noun phrases as apposition, which is an unmarked alternative
to modifying relative clauses.
     The major type of relative clause (RC) is headless. A headless RC functions as a
head itself, it may represent the subject or object argument in the main clause, or an
oblique object. Payne (1997:328) states that generally, “languages in which nominal
modifiers are themselves nouns are more likely to employ headless relative clauses as
a major RC strategy”. This holds for Baure as well, which is a language with nominal
modifiers (cf. 4.9). They are in the same position as nominal modifiers, but see be-
low. Generally there is no relativizing element, except for the nominalized status of
the subordinate clause, but the majority of RCs are introduced by an article or pro-
noun (demonstrative, personal or indefinite). How a headless RC functions as an ar-
gument in the clause is best understood when compared to predication without sub-
ordination. In (48) a simple example of a headless relative clause (subject) is shown
with a non-verbal predicate, which can be directly compared to a clause with the
same predicate and a simple subject NP in (49):
       predicate NPS (in a RC)

       ‘Her dress is pretty.’
Clauses (48) and (49) have the same structure: the predicate monik ‘(it is) pretty’ and
a following subject. In (49) the subject is the possessed NP to riaroni ‘her dress’,
whereas in (48) the subject NP is a nominalized verb to riporian ‘that which she
sewed’. The RC may be much more complex, including adverbs and other modifiers,
and it can refer to the subject or object or oblique object, as will be shown in more
detail below.
CHAPTER 10 - CLAUSE COMBINING AND CLAUSE EMBEDDING                                   399
If the RC has a head it can be described as an NP that modifies the head. That a “rela-
tive clause is one that functions as a nominal modifier” has already been argued by
Keenan 1985 (in Payne 1997:325). As the RC is generally postnominal, it has the
same position as the modifiers that modify a noun within an NP (cf. 4.10). The posi-
tion of the RC is exactly that of a modifier, which has been brought up by Payne to
be a common parallel (cf. Payne 1997:326). Further it seems to be a common feature
of VO languages, such as Baure, to have postnominal RCs. In (50) there is a simple
modifying RC, comparable to the modifier NP in (51):
       predicate          NPO        MOD (RC)
(50)   nampik             nor        nikasačon.
       ni=am-pik          nor        ni=kasačo-no
       1SG=take-COME deer            1SG=hunt-NOM1
       ‘I bring deer that I hunted.’
       predicate             NPO       MOD
(51)   nampik                nor       epenon.
       ni=am-pik             nor       epenon
       1SG=bring-COME        deer      dead
       ‘I bring (a) dead deer.’
In (50) the object NP nor ‘deer’ is directly modified by the RC nikasačon ‘that I
hunted’. The RC is a nominalized predicate that refers to the object and has the same
subject as the main clause, in both cases marked by ni- ‘1SG’. (51) is an example of
the object NP with a modifier epenon ‘dead’ in the same position.
    Even though there is no specific relative pronoun, most relative and even com-
plement clauses are marked by the indefinite pronoun to ka ‘something, someone’. Its
use may be obligatory in cases where the marking of the nominalized predicate is not
apparent or the RC is quite complex, but in general relative and complement clauses
that are marked by to ka can alternatively be expressed without it.
    In the following sections (10.2.1–10.2.4) the different subordination types are
shown in detail, starting with the four nominalization types. Some general facts about
relativization are described in 10.2.1 but may refer to all nominalization types. Fur-
ther on, the specific locative (10.2.5) and temporal (10.2.6) subordination are de-
scribed. Section 10.2.7 demonstrates the cleft construction with tiow ‘this is’, and
10.2.8 makes clear how the indefinite pronoun to ka ‘something, someone’ plays a
role in relative clauses. Finally, in 10.2.9 appositions are shown to be an alternative
for modifying relative clauses.","[417, 418, 419, 420, 421]"
"4.3.2. Possession of Spanish loans
Spanish loanwords are generally treated like non-possessable nouns, even when they
refer to kinship. This does not hold for all Spanish loans, as some of them have al-
ready been incorporated into the Baure language system, but it is certainly true for all
recent loans. Even though there is a Baure word for ‘grandmother’ -os or ‘grandfa-
ther’ -ašok, nowadays the Spanish loan avoel (from Spanish abuelo/a) is used much
more frequently111. It is, however, not possible for this borrowed kinship noun to be
simply marked with the possessor proclitic. Here the possessive pronouns are used
instead, as illustrated in (18):
(18)    to    ntir avoel                      ti       ntir
                                                          avoel
        ART   1SGP grandparent                DEM1f 1SGP  grandparent
        ‘my grandfather’                      ‘my grandmother’
The possessive NPs consist of a determiner, the possessive pronoun and the noun.
The article is used only for male referents and the demonstrative, marked for femi-
nine gender, is used for female referents. The possessive pronoun precedes the noun
just like the personal prefixes, but they have to be considered as independent ele-
ments in the construction, rather comparable to nominal modifiers like -per ‘domesti-
cated animal’ in (16) and (17). Some non-possessable nouns that can logically be
111
    This may also have to do with the fact that the gender division in Baure kinship terms (one general
gender form plus two specific forms, sometimes dependent on the sex of the speaker, cf. 4.1.2) is so
different from the Spanish system that it is not as transparent for bilinguals as it used to be for
monolinguals.
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE                                                           125
possessed make use of the possessive pronouns as well, as e.g. poewok ‘land, ground’
in (19):
(19)       teč        notir poewok
           DEM2m      3PLP ground
           ‘their land’                                                                [RP-23/7/04-10]
Among the exceptions are e.g. clothes, whose names have been borrowed from Span-
ish, but they have been considered to be inalienably possessed nouns, just like other
clothes. This is shown in (20) and (21):
(20)       nisopot           (< Spanish zapato)
           ni=sopot
           1SG=shoe
           ‘my shoe’
(21)       nikomis           (< Spanish camisa)
           ni=komis
           1SG=shirt
           ‘my shirt’4.3.3. Possessive and partitive NPs
Possessive NPs can be more complex when the possessor is not only cliticized but
also explicitly mentioned in the clause. This is the case in NPs like (22) ‘the lizard’s
house’. Instead of only saying teč rower ‘his house’, the possessor is explicit in the
NP to kotis ‘the lizard’. Example (22) illustrates that complex possessive NPs are
simply the juxtaposition of possessed NP and possessor NP, where the possessor is
already included in the possessed NP by the proclitic ro- ‘3SGm’.
           possessed                 possessor
(22)       teč rower to kotis
           teč        ro=wer         to     kotis
           DEM2m      3SGm=house ART lizard
           ‘the house of the lizard’                                                     [RP-N2/I-37]
The speakers of the Baure language make extensive use of this kind of possessive
clauses. The same juxtaposition is not always a possessive relation, but may also be a
partitive NP construction112. In partitive NPs the first element in the juxtaposition is
not necessarily a noun, it may also be a numeral, a quantifier, or some other kind of
modifier. The most important fact in the construction seems to be the nominal status
of the second constituent. It functions like the partitive conjunction with of in Eng-
lish. Two examples of partitive NPs are given in (23) and (24):
(23)       siete’ to yiti
           siet-e’                to           yiti
           seven-CLF:unsweet ART               chili
           ‘seven of the chilies’                                                       [GP-N1/II-30]112
      In 5.3.1 I demonstrate how the juxtaposition of NPs is also used for equation.

         ‘I am washing my son’s head.’                                 [HC-2/7/04-40]
The juxtaposition of NPs can have many functions. There are also e.g. unmarked
relative clauses, which simply consist of the juxtaposition of two NPs (the apposition
in 10.2.9). Equative and other predicate clauses may be a simple juxtaposition as well
(cf. 5.3.1 and 5.3.2). When a complex argument like the ones described in (22)
through (27) itself becomes a predicate, only the first NP is marked with the copula
or another verbal suffix, as illustrated in (28):
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE                                                            127

The second NP to navinon ‘my husband’ (the possessor) is added here like an oblique
argument, following the fully marked predicate retowori ‘she is his sister’113.","[146, 147, 148, 149]"

AcknowledgementsThis work would never have been possible without the great support and collabora-
tion of the Baure people in Bolivia. My greatest thanks go therefore to the speakers
of the language: Justina Cajareico, Dolores Chimanacay Imopoco, Estéban Chipeno

Emorisé, Guillermina Pinaicobo Peña, Rosalía Pinaicobo Peña, Candelaria Sosa,
“Sower” Isabel Sosa; and in particular to Melquiades Durán and Juanita Pinaicobo
Peña for their in depth analysis of the grammar together with me. In the village
Baures I also owe very much to the hospitality of Pedro Ortíz Melgar and Clara
Camama, who always treated me like their own daughter, and to Julián Imanareico
(jr.), Ferrufino Oni Pinaicobo, and Daniel León Camama for introducing me to all the
speakers. My study of Baure has been rewarded with strong friendships, in particular
my close friend Asunta Durán (jr.), who spent much time with me and helped me
understand the Baures’ daily life in the villages. I also appreciated very much the
overall support by the Subcentral Indígena Baures, who for their part acknowledged
my study of the language very much and familiarized the Baure people with my
work. In Trinidad my thanks go to the Pastoral Indígena and the Librería in the Casa
de la Cultura. In Cochabamba I want to thank the students Cristián Salvatierra and
his friends Yazmin and Miguel for sharing and discussing their knowledge on Boliv-
ian culture and languages with me. I further want to give thanks to the Universidad
Mayor de San Simón (Patricia Alandia Mercado), PROEIB Andes, and the Universi-
dad Católica (Don Pedro) for their help and collaboration. In addition I have always
been very glad about all comments and the interest in my work by all students at the
Universidad Mayor San Simón who came to my classes and motivated and encour-
aged me very much.
     I appreciate very much the work with the indigenous people of Baures by Henri-
ette Eva Szabo in the 1990s, which helped significantly to change the bad image of
the Baure language in the community. The study of Baure and the development of an
orthographical representation was facilitated by the alphabetization workshops in
Lowland Bolivia in the 1990s, organized by Colette Grinevald. The work of Pilar
Valenzuela within this framework has been of great importance.
     First and foremost, I would like to express all my gratitude to the team in Ni-
jmegen I worked with and to the promotores of this dissertation. The study of Baure
was carried out within the Spinoza program “Lexicon and Syntax” at the Radboud
University Nijmegen, supervised by Pieter Muysken. In addition I received technical
support from the Max-Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (Nijmegen). I am deeply
indebted to my promotores Pieter Muysken and Mily Crevels, who have guided me
through the sometimes difficult analyses of the Baure language. They have com-
mented on all chapters and presentations and always given insightful suggestions.
Without their help and encouragement at any time this grammar would never have
been completed.
My thanks also go out to my close colleagues of the group around Pieter Muysken
and Mily Crevels, with whom I was able to discuss many specific points in linguistics
and about our fieldwork and other subjects: Rik van Gijn, Katharina Haude, Katja
Hannß, Hein van der Voort. Of very great help was also the group of linguists work-
ing on South American languages, and also that of the typologists who attended the
Americanist Colloquium in Nijmegen: Willem Adelaar, Astrid Alexander, Eithne
Carlin, Connie Dickinson, Wolfgang Dietrich, Rafael Fischer, Jesus Mario Giron,
Roland Hemmauer, Andrej Malchokov, Loretta O’Connor, Norval Smith, Leon Stas-
sen, and Lucrecia Villafañe. All these colleagues have given most valuable advice
and fruitful comments in the meetings, from which my research benefited greatly. In
addition I am deeply indebted to the editors of this grammar, Hein van der Voort,
Simon van de Kerke, and Mily Crevels.
    Furthermore I owe many thanks to the other linguists who I received helpful
comments from: Chris Beyer, Michael Donohue, Carola Emkow, Patty Epps, An-
toine Guillaume, Frank Seifart, and Zygmunt Frajzyngier. My special thanks go to
the linguists Sasha Aikhenvald, Tania Granadillo, Lev Michael, Francoise Rose, and
Lucrecia Villafañe for sharing their vast knowledge on Arawak languages with me. I
hope that this collaboration will continue in the future. The anthropologists Mickaël
Brohan and Isabel Daillant are acknowledged for their openness to discuss their
knowledge on Bolivian Lowland cultures with me. I would also like to give special
thanks to Jeanette Sakel, who introduced me to descriptive work on the languages of
Bolivia and stimulated me to participate in the documentation of endangered lan-
guages.
    Last but not least, I do not want to forget all my friends and the great social net-
work in Leipzig, London, Hanover, and Nijmegen, which supported me through
sometimes hard times and gave me the power and energy to complete my thesis, most
of them my partner Mark Hiller and his and my family.
    I alone am responsible for the errors that this book may contain. Further research
may reveal the necessity for new analyses of specific details in the Baure grammar.

1. Introduction
Baure is spoken in northeast Bolivia, in the Bolivian part of Amazonia. It is a South
Arawak language (according to the classification of Aikhenvald 1999:67–71, and cf.
Figure 1.1)1. Today it is a seriously endangered language (cf. Crevels 2002:21). The
Arawak language family was once very large, spanning from the Carib islands down
to the Andean foothills of Peru and to Bolivian and Brazilian Amazonia, into north-
ern Argentina and Paraguay, including up to 150 languages. Today there is only
about a fourth of these languages left, the others having been replaced by Spanish or
Portuguese. In the next years many of the endangered Arawak languages will have
been replaced and soon only a handful of those with greater speaker numbers will
remain, if any. This background of language decay and death calls for linguists to try
to at least document and study the last remains of these languages. Each language
also offers an insight to a specific image of the world and the categorization of items,
so that the loss of a language means also losing some knowledge about human nature.
The interest in less well studied languages and the urgent need to study them have
been my main concern when writing this grammar of Baure.
     The aim of this book is to provide a grammatical description of the Baure lan-
guage in the form of a detailed reference grammar, which allows linguists to compare
it to other Arawak languages, and that gives linguists from all backgrounds insights
into the phonological and morphosyntactic processes that we find in this specific lan-
guage. For this practical reason, particular technical terminology has been avoided
where possible.
     This chapter sketches the general historical background of the region where the
Baure people live (1.1). It focuses on the study and status of the Baure language ear-
lier in history and today (1.2). In 1.3 the field research necessary for this new corpus
of linguistic data, the consultants, the field site and the kind of data storage are de-
scribed. Baure can be categorized as an Arawak language genetically, as well as an
Amazonian language in a specific linguistic area, as discussed in 1.4. In 1.5 the struc-
ture of the present study is described.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"
"4.1.3. Noun bases
In this section I show how a noun base is composed which does not function as a
predicate. There are certain restrictions and changes when a nominal base is used as a
predicate, shown in 5.2 (cf. Figure 5.2). The structure of the noun base is demon-
strated in Figure 4.2:106
    Only the syllables -po and -ki are actually identical to classifiers in Baure; -po refers to ‘insects, fish,
and little items (like beans)’ and -ki to two-dimensional contents.
107
    In particular the last two suffixes could also be regarded as very specified classifiers.

                        ROOTFigure 4.2: The noun base and position of affixesA noun base that functions as (part of) an NP, may be composed of an attributive or
privative prefix – ko- or mo- respectively – followed by the noun stem. An absolute
or possessive suffix may be attached to the noun stem – -ko ‘ABS’ or -no ‘POSS’ re-
spectively. Finally certain lexemes are followed by the nominalizer -no ‘NOM1’, most
of all, nominalized verbs, but also a subgroup of adjectives (cf. 4.9.3). This whole
noun base is the unit to which the possessor proclitic is attached and to which di-
minutive, augmentative, plural, distributive, and locative suffixes are attached. There
may also be clausal enclitics added at the very end of the word, which are not word
class specific. There are some restrictions concerning the combinability of the mor-
phemes. Nouns marked by the privative prefix cannot be possessed, but they are
mainly used as predicates (cf. 5.2.3). While the absolute suffix is attached to derived
unpossessed nouns, the possessive suffix is only attached to derived possessed nouns
(cf. 4.3). Therefore absolute and possessive are mutually exclusive.
    Furthermore, diminutive and augmentative marking is mutually exclusive. The
marking for plural and the distributive marking seem to be mutually exclusive as
well. Example (2) illustrates the difference between noun stem and base:
                                                               root=stem

Gender is an inherent category in Baure, and it is mainly biological, not grammatical.
Only feminine animates are considered as grammatically feminine, and all other
nouns are masculine. The gender becomes apparent by agreement in cross-
referencing clitics, and personal and possessive and demonstrative pronouns (cf. 8.2–
8.3). In these pronouns and clitics gender is only distinguished in the 3SG. The gender
distinction is demonstrated in Figure 4.3:

Figure 4.3: Gender distinction in Baure nounsInanimates are always referred to by unmarked masculine, while animates can also be
unmarked for gender, as generally all animals. Only for human beings and a few pets,
domesticated animals or animals in a narrative the gender distinction is made. The
gender is not formally apparent in the noun, but there are suppletive forms for female
and male humans and kinship terms and a few animals. Some of these nouns have a
general form that refers generically to both genders, and there are gender specific
nouns in addition. There is e.g. a general noun -iron ‘parent’ and the specific
nouns -en ‘mother’ and -ia’ ‘father’. These general nouns are also of unmarked mas-
culine gender, but then generally interpreted as masculine, while the feminine form
has to be marked by a feminine determiner (at least the feminine demonstrative108 ti
‘DEM1f’). Compare the interpretation of the general form as masculine and feminine
in comparison to the specific forms in examples (3) and (4):
(3) a. to niron             b. ti niron                                  c. to nirononev
       to     ni=iron          ti       ni=iron                             to     ni=irono-nev

       ‘my parent (father)’    ‘my mother’                                  ‘my parents’
(4) a. to nia’                      b. ti nen
       to      ni=ia’                  ti       ni=en
       ART     1SG=father              DEM1f    1SG=mother
       ‘my father’                     ‘my mother’
There may have been a comparable subdivision into a general, a masculine and a
feminine form for grandparents, but only two forms are present today. The
form -ašok is generally used for ‘grandfather’ and -os for ‘grandmother’,
while -aškanev means ‘grandparents’ and usually refers to the married couple of
grandfather and grandmother. This seems to be parallel to the Spanish system, where
the masculine form is pluralized and refers to both genders. However, it does not
necessarily have to be the original Baure system of subdivision, as we find different
traits elsewhere. Siblings (cf. (5) and (6)) are divided according to the point of refer-
ence, i.e. in reference to a man the noun -piri ‘sibling (of the same sex)’ means
‘brother’, whereas in reference to a woman the same lexeme means ‘sister’. This rela-
tive noun co-exists with the gender specific forms for the opposite cases: the
108
    This has to do with the use of this demonstrative as a feminine article, opposed to the general article to,
which is interpreted as masculine (cf. 8.2).

noun -’aiy ‘brother’ is used only by women, and the noun -et ‘sister’ by men. There
may have been such a relative terminology concerning the siblings of parents, i.e.
paternal and maternal aunts and uncles109.

       ‘my brother (said by a man)’
      c. to nipirinev
         to      ni=piri-nev
         ART     1SG=sibling-PL
         ‘my brothers and sisters’

       ‘my brother (said by a woman)’ ‘my sister (said by a man)’
When animals are distinguished for gender, they are either preceded by a determiner,
or alternatively the animal name is marked by a nominal modifier eton ‘woman’ or
hir ‘man’ in a compound construction, as demonstrated in (7):
(7) a. to       tiporek          b. ti        tiporek          c. to      hir    tiporek
         ART    chicken              DEM1f chicken                 ART    man chicken
         ‘the chicken’               ‘the hen’                     ‘the rooster’
In very few examples animals have suppletive forms distinguished by gender, such as
e.g. poeh ‘duck’ and sore’ ‘drake’.","[137, 138, 139, 140]"
"51
   The pronouns in Ignaciano and Trinitario also distinguish who utters them: m–f means here that a mas-
culine referent referred to by a feminine speaker.

1.4.3. The structural features of Baure: genetic and areal features
Geographically Baure belongs to the Amazonian region. Amazonia is generally de-
fined as the “region including the two Guianas, most of the Amazon basin of Brazil,
and some eastern portions of Bolivia, Columbia, and Peru” (Derbyshire & Pullum
1986:1). Amazonia is probably “the most complex linguistic area in the world today”
(Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999:2) with approximately 300 languages that belong to 20
language families and around 12 isolates (Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999:2). There have
been people living in Amazonia for thousands of years, and because of the many dif-
ferent languages, it is not surprising that “[m]ultilingualism was (and is) the norm
among the Indian tribes of Amazonia” (Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999:5). Ethnic groups
in Amazonia share a lot of their culture and history. Since the time of colonization we
can observe the decimation or extinction of many Amazonian groups due to imported
diseases, enslavement and maltreatment. In the time of the rubber boom (as men-
tioned in 1.1.3) the whole area was affected by strong migration and the exploitation
of many indigenous people, which altogether led to language diffusion and death
(Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999:6). Many linguists (among these Derbyshire & Pullum
1986 and Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999) have come to the conclusion that Amazonia can
be regarded as a linguistic area, defined as “a region including languages from sev-
eral genetic groups, with the languages sharing certain symptomatic features which
can be inferred to have diffused across the area” (Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999:8). Der-
byshire & Pullum (1986:1) even argue that “Amazonian languages share a wide
range of similarities in grammatical and phonological structure that transcend cur-
rently genetic groupings”, and Dixon & Aikhenvald (1999:16) claim that we ought to
understand that probably for the Amazonian region the family tree model does not
hold after all. That means that it is important to consider areal features in addition to
the features of languages within the Arawak language family. The shared features of
Amazonian languages have been listed from two different perspectives. While Der-
byshire & Pullum (1986:19) mainly list syntactic and pragmatic features, Dixon &
Aikhenvald (1999:8–9) have analyzed phonological and morphological features.
    The grammar of Baure tallies with many of the Amazonian features, though not
all. In most cases Amazonian features correspond to Arawak features, because the
majority of Arawak languages are also Amazonian and have therefore also added to
the generalizations of the linguistic area. In addition, the authors (Dixon & Aikhen-
vald 1999) may also have taken Arawak languages into consideration to a greater
degree than other languages because of their own research interests. Thus Baure
shares the following features with Amazonian areal as well as with Arawak genetic
features:
Phonology:
(a) only one rounded vowel o or u
(b) only one liquid
Morphology:
(c) polysynthetic, head-marking, agglutinating with little fusion
(d) extensive classifier system
(e) noun incorporation

(f) no extensive case system
(g) verb agreement with S and O: thus many clauses with only a predicate
(h) mainly suffixing
Morphosyntax:
(i) split ergative or split stative system concerning argument marking
(j) subordination involves nominalized verbs
Lexicon:
(k) nouns distinguished for alienable/inalienable possession
(l) small class of lexical numbers
In addition to these areal (and genetic) features there are some Arawak features that
Baure shows, which cannot be argued to be Amazonian areal features. These are un-
stable stops (frequently palatalized) and the avoidance of consonant clusters in the
phonology. Furthermore, Amazonian languages tend to incorporate nouns or other
lexical material before the verb root, whereas at least in South Arawak languages
(Aikhenvald 1999:86) and in Baure they follow the root. It may still be questionable
if the predominant constituent order in Amazonia is in fact object before subject (cf.
Derbyshire & Pullum 1986:17–18), because the authors also counted Baure wrongly
as an instance of VOS order (cf. Chapter 9).
    It is striking that Baure never disagrees with any Amazonian features that would
hold for Arawak languages. This shows that the genetic relationship is very clear, but
it cannot really be argued that Baure shows any more Amazonian areal features than
Arawak languages do in general.
    On the other hand, there are a number of characteristics of Baure disagreeing with
both Amazonian areal and Arawak genetic features. There are for example no pho-
nemically long vowels in Baure, nor do nasalization or glottalization play a major
role in the Baure phonology. The order possessor–possessed is found internally by
cross-reference of the possessor on the head noun in Baure (like in other Arawak
languages), but externally Baure uses partitive constructions of the form to tawe’ to
monči’ (ART ball ART child) ‘the ball of the child/ the child’s ball’, in which the pos-
sessed NP is juxtaposed and precedes the possessor NP. Conjunctions are not explic-
itly mentioned in Arawak generalizations, the most dominant features for subordina-
tion being nominalization and verb serialization. In Baure, however, there are many
clause combining and constituent combining conjunctions (called connectors in this
grammar, cf. Chapter 10), alongside with the possibilities of clause juxtaposition,
serial verbs and predicate chains, and complement constructions. Even though Baure
also shows a kind of split system, its characteristics do not coincide with those of the
ergative or stative split systems of other Amazonian and Arawak languages. There is
a split in argument marking in Baure, but it seems to be governed by word class
rather than by verb semantics, such as active and stative (cf. Danielsen & Granadillo
2007).
    These deviations could be Baure specific features, but it is also possible that they
are shared by other languages of the area. Recent research (Crevels & van der Voort,
in press) has shown that a new linguistic area can be established between the Mamoré
and the Guaporé (Iténez) rivers, extending further into Rondônia (Brasil). It remains
32                                         BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
to be investigated how Baure tallies with the features of this linguistic sub-area in
Amazonia.","[51, 52, 53, 54]"
"8.3.4. Possessive pronouns
The possessive pronouns have been derived from the personal pronouns by attach-
ment of a morpheme -ro, such as e.g. piti-r(o) ‘your’ (2SG). It is unclear where this
suffix originated. Matteson (1972:162) argues for a general marker for possession in
Arawak languages, which has the form -ri. However, in Baure there is no evidence
for such a possession marker, but the suffix that produced the possessive pronouns
320                                          BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
may still go back to a Proto-Arawak formative. Possessive pronouns are demon-
strated in Table 8.11:
                    NUMBER
 POSSESSOR
                    SINGULAR                PLURAL

 2                  pitir                   yitir
 3 feminine         ritir
                                            notir
 3 masculine        rotir
Table 8.11: The possessive pronounsPossessive pronouns are used even less often than the other independent personal
pronouns. They are mainly used in possessive constructions with Spanish loanwords
(cf. 4.3.2) and a few nouns that cannot be used in a derived possessed form with a
personal proclitic. Further the possessive forms are also found to mark a specific se-
mantic role of an argument in certain constructions. This usage seems to be a more
recent development, as it cannot be observed in the data of Baptista & Wallin. In
these clauses the possessive pronoun is generally followed by the personal pronoun,
as in (42) and (43).
(42)    nihino’inokow rotir roti’.
        ni=hino’inoko-wo rotir           roti’
        1SG=think-COP        3SGmP       3SGm
        ‘I am thinking of him.’                                           [MD-12/7/04-3]
(43)    roti’ roenisa popoš him pitir piti’.
        roti’ ro=inisa       po-po-š                him     pitir piti’
        3SGm 3SGm=fish one-CLF:tiny-one             fish    2SGP 2SG
        ‘He caught one fish for you.’                                     [RP-21/7/04-37]
In both examples the possessive pronoun seems to mark a semantic role different
from agent and patient. In (42) the reason for this special marking seems to be a re-
striction on the transitivity of the verb -hino’inok- ‘think’, which can probably only
take a non-human object. In (43) the argument pitir piti’ refers to the recipient, a role
that can also be the direct object of a benefactive verb base. The speaker uses this
construction instead of the benefactive derivation (already mentioned in 1.2.4).
    As Baure has grammaticalized the marking of possessors by procliticization, the
possessive pronoun has been reanalyzed as a possessed noun, as e.g. ro-tir ‘his’,
which can be analyzed as 3SGm=*possession. Thus these pro-forms are frequently
used like nominals with a preceding determiner and as real pronouns for the noun
referred to. The noun -tir is also translated as ‘doll’ that a child is playing with, as in
example (44):
(44)    niporoč to ntir.
        ni=poro-čo          to     ntir or: ni=poro-čo         to      ni=tir
        2SG=lose-APPL ART 1SGP              1SG=lose-APPL      ART     1SG=possession
        ‘I lost my toy (lit. possession).’                               [RP-22/7/04-46]

This nominal base can also be used as the non-verbal predicate ‘possess’ in affirma-
tive clauses (cf. 5.3.5 and 8.3.4 below).","[341, 342, 343]"

examples (7) and (16), (17)). Modification within an NP is not very common in
Baure in general. A quantitative text analysis of 22 texts with altogether 9740 words
(cf. Table 4.29) shows this. The texts consisted of narratives, conversation, and artifi-
cial stories, four of them from Baptista & Wallin (T-287 through T-289). In all the
texts there were altogether 173 modifiers in NPs, not more than 1,78 % of all words.
In six texts of between 50 and 200 words there is only one modifier or none. The
reason for this is related to the predicative use of modifiers. Predicates are the most
important constituents in every clause in Baure. Among these are not only verbs, but
also a large number of non-verbal predicates. In addition there are strategies like in-
corporation and compounding. Furthermore adjectives are nominal and can be used
as heads themselves. This all leads to little need for modification within the NP, as
the predicate already contains most of the informational load. This means that the
adjectives introduced in 4.9 are more frequently used as predicates or head nouns
than as modifiers. Consider Table 4.29:

Table 4.29: Numbers of modifiers in text corpusThe figures in Table 4.29 indicate that the majority of modifiers are possessive pro-
nouns. In one narrative of 2298 words with many modifiers I counted 62 nominal
modifiers (2,7 %), 37 are possessive pronouns (1,61 %).
   Modifiers can occur in two positions: preceding the head noun and following it.
The majority of modifiers (79,2 %) precede the head. These are possessive pronouns,
numerals, the word ‘other’, and nouns. Adjectives of class I and III generally follow
the head. Adjectives of class II (absolute forms) may precede or follow the head.
These different modifier positions are demonstrated again in Figure 4.9:
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE                                                169

Figure 4.9: Position of modifiers in an NPThe figure also shows that the NP is generally introduced by a determiner. Before
numerals there is generally none, but it is possible to add one. Possessive pronouns
are more often preceded by a determiner than not.
    Surprisingly, in the text corpus were few adjectives of class I with a suffixed clas-
sifier in the text corpus, whereas in elicitation they are numerous. This may again
explain that these forms can be used as head nouns themselves, which they presuma-
bly are more frequently. Especially with the “repeater” classifiers it seems redundant
to repeat the noun. This can be observed in (163), where the head noun koyorisoe’
‘totaí fruit’ is only mentioned once, but later in two other sentences the speaker refers
back to it only with adjectives including a classifier: poskiš ‘one (seed)’ and posoki
‘another seed’. The speaker could have added the noun koyoroesoki ‘nut of the totaí
fruit’, but this information is superfluous. In fact the adjectives even only refer to part
of the noun as metonymy.

In the following, the different adjectives and their positions are demonstrated. First of
all adjectives of class I generally follow the head, as in (164) and (165):

Derived adjectives of class III generally follow the head noun as well, as in (166) and
(167):

Absolute adjectives occur more frequently before the head, as in (168), but may also
follow it, as in (169):

       ‘And he had one of the wings of that pretty girl.’                   [RP-N4-56]
There are certain absolute adjectives that prefer one position over the other. While
monik ‘pretty’ tends to follow nouns, čonok ‘big’ tends to precede them. The same
holds for Spanish loans, which are treated like class II forms: powor ‘poor’ generally
precedes nouns, and pikor ‘rascally’, sons ‘stupid’, and others follow it. There can
also be two class II adjectives preceding the head, as in (170):
(170) rivehosoekir-hi teč powor ane’ waka’.
      ri=vehosoek=ro=hi           teč       powor           ane’   waka’

CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE                                         171
Numerals and ‘other’ always precede the head noun, as in (171):
(171) ač rokew teč pa yor: …
      ač     ro=kew        teč     po-a                    yor

      ‘And the other monkey said: …’                                    [RP-N4-30]
When both occur in the same NP, ‘other’ precedes the numeral, as in (172):
(172) pon mapin etonanev
      po-no              mapi-no       eton-anev
      other-CLF.human    two-CLF:human woman-hPL
      ‘the other two women’                                         [GP-16/9/03-68]
In respect to modification of NPs it is important to know that modifying relative
clauses are characterized by a nominalized predicate, and they generally follow the
head directly. This behaviour is comparable to that of modifying adjectives of class
III, which are frequently nominalized forms, marked by -no ‘NOM1’, one of the
nominalizers used in relative clauses (10.2).
5. Predicate types and specific predicate constructions
In Baure the two main predicate types are verbs and non-verbal predicates. Non-
verbal predicates in Baure are as common as verbs. Magio (1749 [1880]:5) already
noted that “todo nombre se hace verbo en esta lengua.”136 Baptista & Wallin also
argued that the use of non-verbs as predicates is a kind of verbalization137. However,
non-verbal predicates are substantially different from verbs. It is true that almost all
verbal base suffixes can be attached to nouns and other non-verbs, but the two types
of predicates, verbal and non-verbal, can be distinguished by the different kinds of
argument marking they take. While subjects are marked by proclitics on verbs and
objects by enclitics, non-verbal predicates have subject marking by enclitics. In 5.1
verbal argument marking is described, and in 5.2 non-verbal argument marking. Spe-
cific kinds of predicate clauses are discussed in 5.3, and in 5.4 the incorporation of
arguments and Ground. In 5.5 comparative constructions in Baure are presented.","[189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195]"
"5.2. Non-verbal predicates
Any other word class apart from verbs can be used as a non-verbal predicate. The
functions of these predicates are various. There are existential, possessive, attributive,
equative, and locative constructions, as described in 5.3. Some non-verbal predicates
may also be translated as English verbs, for example many predicates based on time
adverbs, as in (21):
(21)   kewašan katirokapoekoe’!
       ke-wo-a-ša-no           katiro-ko-a-pa-ikoe’
       EV-COP-LK-IRR-NOM1      early-ABS-LK-GO-EMPH
       ‘Go on and go only for a little while!’                         [DC-18/4/06-38]
(22)   ver etovi to pišoerekčow?
       ver    eto-wo=pi        to    pi=išoerek-čo-wo
       PERF finish-COP=2SG ART       2SG=cook-NOM2-COP
       ‘Have you already finished cooking?’                             [JC-29/7/04-28]
In (21) the meaning ‘go’ is included in both, the first and the second predicate in dif-
ferent ways. The imperative predicate kew is generally interpreted as motion away
from the speaker (cf. 9.3.4). The suffix -pa ‘GO’ adds the meaning of motion away
from the speaker to the second predicate. The form eto- in (22) is also glossed ‘fin-
ish’, but it should not be analyzed as a verb (cf. 5.2.2).
     Most non-verbal predicates are based on adjectives and nouns, and are attributive
or equative. They are juxtaposed to the subject. Only in negative clauses and in the
case of pronominalization the subject is marked on the predicate by a personal en-
clitic, as in (23) and (24):
CHAPTER 5 - PREDICATE TYPES AND SPECIFIC PREDICATE CONSTRUCTIONS                    179

As (23) and (24) show, the subjects are marked by -ro ‘3SGm’. Recall that objects on
verbs are marked by pronominal enclitics. They will be shown to be similar to those
on non-verbal predicates (cf. 5.2.1). In other Arawak languages there is also a sub-
group of intransitive verbs that show this kind of argument marking: In a subgroup of
intransitive verbs the subject is marked by a suffix, whereas on transitive verbs this
suffix refers to the object. The phenomenon has been described as a Split-S system
(cf. Aikhenvald 1999:86; Facundes 2000a:278). The verbs with this kind of argument
marking (frequently referred to as objective marking, cf. Facundes 2000a) are re-
ferred to as stative verbs (Aikhenvald 1999), descriptive verbs (Facundes 2000a:274)
or absolute verbs (Wise 1986:571). Since Baure seems to deviate from other Arawak
languages, a different approach is taken in this grammar. In Baure there are no verbs
taking a suffix enclitic, but all predicates with this kind of subject marking are ana-
lyzed as non-verbal. All non-verbal predicates parallel nominal predicates and their
way of marking a subject. Stative verbs in Baure constitute a subgroup of intransitive
verbs, but they show exactly the same kind of argument marking as other intransitive
verbs, cf. (25):
(25)   nti’ nišoerenokiapapi, koeč pikotivew.
       nti’ ni=šoere-noki-a-pa=pi               koeč     pi=kotive-wo
       1SG 1SG=cook-mouth-LK-GO=2SG because 2SG=be.sick-COP
       ‘I will cook for you (lit. your mouth), because you are sick.’ [GP-11/7/04-42]
A comparable meaning can be expressed with a non-verbal predicate, as in (26):
(26)   noka henowapa nik, koeč maviwapani.
       noka heno-wapa nik              koeč      mavi-wapa=ni
       NEG    good-COS       1SG.eat because sick-COS=1SG
       ‘I cannot eat well any more, because I am very sick.’          [JC-14/3/06-38]
The major difference between the two predicates -kotive- ‘be sick’ and mavi ‘sick’ is
the way the subject arguments are cross-referenced: by a proclitic in (25) and an en-
clitic in (26). Further -kotive- is a bound form, whereas mavi is a free form. Even
though both words have been translated by ‘sick’ in the examples, they have a
slightly different connotation: -kotive- means that someone is sick and may recover,
while mavi is used for old people when they get sick before they die. The non-verbal
predicate based on the adjective mavi is thus interpreted as a rather permanent state,
and the verb -kotive- as temporary. The same effect can also be observed with nomi-
nalized verbs used as non-verbal predicates instead of the verbs they are derived
180                                                   BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
from. The stative verb -tiri- ‘know’ is frequently used in the nominalized form tirin
‘knowing’, which may be considered a derived adjective139. The nominalized form
expresses a permanent state, and the verb rather a temporary state or the process of
gaining knowledge, as in (27) and (28):
(27)       ti ntir avoel tirin to rišoerekčow.

Both predicates can take a complement, but the complement of the non-verbal predi-
cate is marked for subordination by -čo ‘NOM2’ (cf. 10.3.6), and the verb -tiri- takes
an unmarked complement (cf. 10.3.5).
    Stative verbs have much in common with non-verbal predicates, which are gener-
ally all stative as well. Stative predicates (verbs and non-verbal) can be distinguished
from non-stative verbs in Baure in relation to how certain base suffixes are attached.
The base suffixes described in more detail in 6.5 can be subdivided into stative and
non-stative suffixes. Stative suffixes can be attached to active and stative predicates.
Non-stative suffixes are generally only attached to non-stative verbs. When they are
attached to a stative predicate, the linking morpheme -a has to be inserted before
them (cf. 3.3.2). Table 5.3 shows all stative suffixes:

The verb -karow- ‘study’ is a stative verb in Baure. Other stative verbs are all those
including the subjective suffix -’ino ‘SUBJ’, like -veiy’in- ‘be hungry’, -či’in- ‘be
full’, or -ki’in- ‘want’. Stative verbs are also those derived by ko- ‘ATTR’, such
as -košir- ‘get a baby’, -kavinon- ‘marry (husband)’, -koeyin- ‘marry (a wife)’, and
many others (cf. 6.4.1). There are only very few underived stative verbs: -tiri-
‘know’, -harok- ‘while’, and -karow- ‘study’.
    When a non-stative suffix, like e.g. -pa ‘GO’ is attached to a stative verb or non-
verbal predicate, the linker is inserted, as in (33) and (34) in contrast to (32).

Table 5.4: Non-stative base suffixesThe fact that there is a split within the class of verbs with relation to stativeness may
hint at a split system, but it is not related to the kind of argument marking exhibited
by a Split-S system. As examples (25), (28), (30), and (33) showed, in Baure stative
verbs do not differ from active verbs with respect to argument marking.
    Non-verbal predicates are based on nouns or nominalized forms, already exempli-
fied by tirin ‘knowing’ in (27). Another one is (35), derived from the verb -am- ‘take’
in a relative clause.","[200, 201, 202, 203]"
"8.3.6. The indefinite pronoun
The indefinite pronoun to ka is used in many fixed expressions, and its meaning is
not always clear. It is mainly used as a relative pronoun (cf. 10.2.8), but the pronoun
to ka (ART IND) is translated as ‘something/somebody’. It may be negated as nka to ka
(NEG ART IND) ‘nothing/nobody’, a complex form consisting of three particles. The
form ka is marked by the article to. This form is also found in the plural demonstra-
tive pronouns to neč ‘DEM2PL’ and to nen ‘DEM3PL’ (cf. Table 8.8). The complex
negative form is frequently used as a negative existential with nka ‘NEG’ as the nega-
tive existential predicate ‘there is not’ in juxtaposition with to ka ‘something’. In (50)
and (51) there are examples:
(50)   aiy, ti koyepian, risokia to ka apo rikoyepian.
       aiy      ti        koyepia-no         ri=sokia      to     ka      apo

       ‘Nobody stayed (lit. There isn’t anybody who stayed).’ [AD/DC-D2-141]
In many other examples to ka functions as a complementizer. It is never found as a
free form without a following modifier. In (52) the use as a complementizer is exem-
plified:
(52)   nka henowor to ka ronikoč.
       nka heno-wo=ro            to     ka     ro=niko-čo

Interjections (8.4.1) are unchangeable particles with an exclamatory character,
whereas discourse particles (8.4.2) are generally morphologically analyzable, or lex-
emes that can be used as verbs or nouns as well in the language.
CHAPTER 8 - CLOSED WORD CLASSES                                                                            323
8.4.1. Interjections
Interjections form a closed class of words in Baure. They “are words, often of an ex-
clamatory character, that can constitute utterances in themselves, and that usually
have no syntactic connection to any other words that may occur with them”
(Schachter 1985:58). As all Baure speakers are bilingual in Spanish, there is also fre-
quent use of Spanish interjections. When people just start using Baure again with me,
or in elicitation the Spanish forms sometimes get mixed into Baure (a kind of code-
switching). Generally, the more the speakers reconnect to the Baure language again,
or the longer they talk exclusively in Baure, the more Baure specific interjections pop
up. Some of these interjections are also Spanish loans. (In many cases this does hap-
pen with unequal relations, e.g. Quechua interjections in Spanish, Muysken, p.c.).
The Baure interjections have not been borrowed into the local Spanish.
    Interjections are used to express surprise, emphasis, pain, hesitation, etc. One of
the most frequent interjections is the hesitation form –ha– ‘HES’, used in pauses be-
tween words and sometimes also between clitics and bases. The pauses are a sign of
the speaker’s insecurity or searching for the appropriate lexeme. Since Baure is a
dying language, the speakers generally use this pausal form –ha– quite a lot, mainly
before nouns. Consider the following example, in which the speaker wants to say ‘my
finger is aching’, but he cannot find the word for ‘finger’207.
(53)     nkotičow ten –ha– te niwohis te ntir –ha–, nkotičowor –ha–.

The interjection –ha– is inserted between the determiner and the noun, as in (53), or
between subject NP and VP, between particles and main predicate (54), clause ini-
tially directly after a connector, such as ač ‘and’, or right before direct speech quota-
tions in narratives (55).

   In Baure the word -wohis means likewise ‘hand’ and ‘finger’, whereas in Spanish, like in English, there
are two different words. This confuses the speaker, and he is looking for the correct translation. The
speaker is trying to build the construction in analogy to the ‘toes’, which are to niwohis to nipoiy ‘finger(s)
of my foot’, but the repetition *to niwohis to niwohis ‘finger of my hand’ is not used in Baure.

It can also be found between the subject proclitic and the verb base. In this case the
personal clitic is repeated, attached to the verb, after the pause (56). That there are
pauses possible was one argument that the personal morphemes are clitics and not
affixes, because the pause indicates its lexical and syntactic independence, in my
view.

In addition to –ha– there is another interjection inserted where the speaker really
stumbles: yoš. This interjection varies phonologically between [yç] and [ya]. yoš
means something like ‘what was it again?’ and can also be replaced by
woyowoyowo(š) ‘what’s the name?’, an irregular predicate based on the verb -
woyowoy- ‘(have) name’. One example of yoš appears in (57). All interjections with a
relatively difficult or complex translation are glossed as ‘INTJ’ and can be looked up
in Table 8.12.

In (58) an example where woyowoyowoš ‘what’s the name?’ is used:
(58)        ver kač nopihik to neč – woyowoyowoš – to neč simorinev.
            ver    kač no=pihik         to   neč       woyo~woyo-wo=š

            ‘Then the – what was their name? – the pigs passed by.’              [RP-N3-120]
As the analysis in the glosses of (58) shows, the irregular predicate woyowoyowoš
ends in the exclamatory clitic -š, which occurs in a reduced form here. This clausal
clitic may also have been the origin of the final fricative in the interjection yoš. yoš is
more emphatic than –ha– ‘HES’ and can also express surprise, astonishment or ex-
haustion.","[344, 345, 346]"
"3.6. Compounding
Compounding is a highly productive process in Baure. It is closely related to incorpo-
ration and probably played a significant role in the evolution of classifiers. There are
compounds of two free nouns (40), or of a free and a bound noun (41):
(40)   kohises
       kohi-ses                  kohi’      +      ses
       stone-sun                 stone             sun
       ‘hail’
(41)   tiporekpo’e
       tiporek-po’e              tiporek    +      -po’e
       chicken-head              chicken           head
       ‘chicken head’
In general, compounds of two free nouns cannot be regarded as productive, reflected
in their special meaning. These kinds of compounds are usually fossilized. Very fre-
quent are compounds with bound noun roots, particularly body parts, as in (41).
There are compounds of noun roots with classifiers:
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES                                    97
(42)   yakis

       fire-CLF:stick            fire               CLF:stick
       ‘firewood’
There are compounds derived from a verb root by attaching a classifier, which result
in a noun:
(43)   konoropi
       kono-ro-pi             -kono-        +       -pi
       write-ro-CLF:long&thin write                 CLF:long&thin
       ‘pencil’
The morpheme -ro is currently unanalyzed, but it carries a function in temporal and
other subordinate relations (cf. 10.2.6). Here it may have been used as a kind of
linker. There are also many compounds with right-bound adjectives and a noun root
or classifier, as in (44) and (45):
(44)   čoser
       čo-ser                    čo-        +       -ser
       big-tooth                 big                tooth
       ‘big tooth’
(45)   čompe
       čo-mpe                     čo-       +       -mpe
       big-CLF:flat               big               CLF:flat
       ‘big flat object (e.g. house)’
There are probably no compound verbs consisting of two verb stems. There is only
incorporation of a verb stem into specific predicate constructions (cf. 3.7).
   Compounding has also created complex classifiers and grammatical morphemes.
Examples are (46) and (47):
(46)   pahakiš kanikon
       po-ahaki-š                           kanikon       -aha      +      -ki
       one-CLF:container.contents-one       food          CLF:container    CLF:contents
       ‘one plate full of food’                                            [RP-9/7/04-22]
(47)   ver pihanowapa
       ver    pi=hano-wapa                                -wa       +      -pa
       PERF 2SG=be.healthy-COS                            TEMP             GO
       ‘You are already healthy again.’                                   [DC-17/4/06-82]
The classifier -ahaki- ‘(food) container contents’ (46) is composed of two other clas-
sifiers, as indicated. If only the containers are counted, only the classifier -aha- ‘con-
tainer’ is attached to the numeral: pahaš nikirok ‘one plate’. Thus the meaning of the
whole has also been derived from the meaning of each element. Usually compounds
of grammatical elements have a specialized meaning, as is also the case in (47). The
change of state or changed state morpheme -wapa ‘COS’ is a fixed unit with a specific
98                                          BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
meaning, which is not directly derived from the meaning of the separate mor-
phemes -wa ‘TEMP’ and -pa ‘GO’.
   As mentioned in 3.3.2, the linker -a ‘LK’ is sometimes inserted between parts of
some compound, but not others, to link the two parts, as in (48) in contrast to (49):
(48)   tikorokapon
       tikorok-a-pon         →         tokorok        +      -pon
       guava-LK-leaf                   guava                 leaf
       ‘papaya tree’
(49)   porepon
       pore-pon              →         pore’          +      -pon
       mate-leaf                       mate                  leaf
       ‘mate leaf’
Even though composed of the same nominal root -pon ‘leaf’, in (48) the first nominal
root is connected by the linker -a, while in (49) the two parts are composed without
it. The linker also occurs after some incorporated nouns and classifiers (cf. 3.7), and
between grammatical morphemes. Within predicate constructions the application of
the linker is related to the difference between active and stative lexical stems (cf.
5.2), but elsewhere its occurrence cannot be predicted.
     The rules for the linker could reveal more about the character of compounding
and affixation and their relation, but still needs further investigation. The linker fi-
nally also occurs in between a nominal base and a grammatical morpheme (50), or on
an adjectival base and a nominal root (51):
(50)   nešari
       neš-a-ri
       meat-LK-NOM3
       ‘meat eater (carnivore)’
(51)   ikiyamonoe’
       ikiy-a-mono-e’
       middle-LK-young-EMPH
       ‘middle-aged’3.7. Incorporation
Incorporation is “a special case of compound formation” (Anderson 1985:6), involv-
ing a noun root or classifier and a verb. It is very productive in Baure. As mentioned
above (3.3), the insertion of classifiers may be regarded as derivational or inflec-
tional. In general, it is the object argument that is incorporated into any kind of verb
base, as in -sipa- ‘wash’ in (52) and (53):
(52)   pisipapoiyap
       pi=sipa-poiy-a-po               →          -poiy
       2SG=wash-foot-LK-PRFLX                     foot
       ‘You wash your feet.’                                           [JP-20/8/03-14]
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES                                      99
(53)   nisipamirokop
       ni=sipa-miro-ko-po                →           -mir
       1SG=wash-face-ABS-PRFLX                       face
       ‘I wash my face.’                                                  [JP-20/8/03-13]
The two examples represent the two major types of incorporation: In (52) the noun -
poiy- ‘foot’ is followed by the linker -a, whereas in (53) the noun root -mir ‘face’ is
incorporated with a following absolute suffix, -ko ‘ABS’. This element is not part of
the verb base -sipa- ‘wash’ without incorporation. In other verbs this absolute suffix
is part of the base, and the incorporated noun with the linker -a is inserted exactly
into this slot. The major difference of the two incorporated arguments is presumably
that of definiteness, perfectivity, and individuation: the argument in (52) is incorpo-
rated as the complete argument, part of the action. It is definite (the feet of the sub-
ject), perfective, and individuated. In (53) the incorporated noun root -mir is rather
analyzed as a type reference, ‘the face’ as a Ground (Talmy 2000:311–344) where
the action takes place, instead of the patient that undergoes the action. This difference
can be better observed with the same nominal root in the different kinds of incorpora-
tion, as in (54) and (55):
(54)   raročipiaw
       ro=aro-čipi-a-wo
       3SGm=climb-roof-LK-COP
       ‘He is climbing the back of an animal.’                           [DC-16/3/06-21]
(55)   raročipikow
       ro=aro-čipi-ko-wo
       3SGm=climb-roof-ABS-COP
       ‘He climbs (on) the roof.’                                        [DC-16/3/06-20]
The noun root -čipi ‘back, roof’ is also used as a classifier for roof-like animals.
However, here it is not analyzed as the classifier, as it refers to the back or roof itself.
In (54) the back of an animal is conceptualized as an argument. In (55), the roof of a
house is not an argument, but the Ground where the subject climbs upon. Therefore
the non-individuated incorporated noun (55) is followed by the absolute morpheme,
which is also used to derive unpossessed (generic) nouns. The same holds for incor-
porated classifiers, as in (56).
(56)   iyowkopian
       iyowko-pi-a-no
       various-CLF:long&thin-LK-NOM1
       ‘various (e.g. snakes)’
Classifiers and noun roots can be incorporated into a quantifier, as in (56), and also
into derived adjectives which are nominalized forms, as in (57). This kind resembles
the incorporation into intransitive verbs (cf. 5.4).
100                                           BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA

       mosero-pi-no                          mosero-ko-no
       red-CLF:long&thin-NOM1                red-ABS-NOM1
       ‘red (e.g. snake)’                    ‘red’
As mentioned above, in some interrogative constructions we can observe the incorpo-
ration of verb roots, as in (58):
(58)   pikie’esasačowor?
       pi=kie-esasa-čo-wo-ro
       2SG=EV-crack-APPL-COP-3SGm
       ‘How did you crack it (the nut)?                                       [RP-N3-70]
In (58) the specific verb -esasa- ‘crack’ has been incorporated into a construction
with the empty verb root -ke-. In this kind of incorporation, there is generally the ap-
plicative suffix -čo attached after the compound verb, which refers to an instrumental
role of a possible argument. The question could also be translated as ‘What did you
crack it with?’.","[118, 119, 120, 121, 122]"

Table 4.12: Parts of palm treesIn many compounds the linking morpheme -a ‘LK’ is inserted. The function of this
linker is unclear to me, especially because it is employed in many other kinds of
morpheme composition. It may be partly related to phonological conditions, but the
multi-functionality of the linking morpheme remains a subject for future research.
Along with some examples in Table 4.12 there are some more examples where the
linker is inserted in the compounds in (63) through (65):
(63)    sopirap
        sopir-a-po                →      sopir          +      nop
        turtle-LK-bone                   turtle                bone
        ‘turtle bone’
(64)    čomomoeawok
        čomomoe-a-wok             →      čomomoe’       +      -wok
        flower-LK-tree                   flower                tree
        ‘tree with flowers’
(65)    čorap
        čor-a-po                  →      čor            +      -po
        maize-LK-CLF:tiny                maize                 CLF:tiny
        ‘maize meal’
Example (65) is a compound of a noun and a classifier, but also linked by the mor-
pheme -a ‘LK’. It is simply coincidence that the reduced morpheme -po for ‘bone’ in
(63) is homophonous with the classifier. The free noun, however, is nop ‘bone’.
There are a number of left-bound nominal stems that only occur in compounds. It is
sometimes difficult to decide if they should be analyzed as classifiers. I do not con-
sider the reduced form of ‘bone’ -po in (63) a classifier, as it only occurs in com-
pounds. The morpheme -wok, on the other hand, is a left-bound morpheme that is
found in compounds, generally meaning ‘tree’. The same morpheme is used as a
classifier, attached to numerals and adjectives, which refer to trees. In compounds -
wok has even been semantically more extended. This extension in meaning may be
part of its development into a classifier. In Table 4.13 the different meanings of -wok

are described, with the examples divided into the different steps of semantic exten-
sions:

        mamisowok                                ‘sweet potato plantation’
        ekšowok                                  ‘manioc field (lit. manioc plant-plantation)’
        yitiawok                                 ‘chili plantation’

        hekoewok                                 ‘countryside (hekoe = ?)’
        es’hiwok                                 ‘grassland (es’hi = ?)’
        inowok                                   ‘water place (in = water)’
        momoewok                                 ‘dry clay place (-momoe = dry clay)’
        poewok                                   ‘ground (poe = down)’
        sesowok                                  ‘place in the sun (ses = sun)’
Table 4.13: The semantic extension of N2: -wokTable 4.13 illustrates that the most specific (and probably original) meaning of -wok
is ‘tree’, as in (a). The general lexeme ewokoe’ ‘tree’ has been derived from the
bound root by attaching the unspecified possessor prefix e- and the final emphatic
suffix -i’. The morpheme -wok has been extended to a place where trees or plants are
cultivated: ‘plantation’, as shown in (b). Further the extension leads to the general
meaning ‘place’, as presented in (c).
    A great number of classifiers are – apart from being used as classifiers – also part
of a lexeme, where they occur in compounds as N2. An example is the classifier -pi,
which refers to long and thin objects and animals. The most prototypical members of
this class are snakes and worms. In some worm names we do indeed find the classify-
ing morpheme. The word koropi ‘liana’ is also a typical plant including the classifier
-pi. The body part -pih ‘throat, all around neck’ consists of almost only the classifier
morpheme. We can hypothesize that this classifier has also evolved from a full noun
stem meaning ‘worm’ or ‘snake’ or ‘throat’, which was then further extended to
things like kaharopi ‘thread’, yakopi ‘candle’, and virepi ‘horizon’. Payne (1991:383)
138                                                  BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
supports this suggestion by arguing that “sets show cognacy between lexical nouns in
some Maipuran [Arawak, my comment] languages and noun classifying suffixes in
other languages”. He particularly refers to the mentioned classifier for “long, slender,
snake-like” (Payne 1991:383). In his cognate set some Arawak languages use a cog-
nate form of Baure -pi as a lexeme for ‘snake’. He reconstructed the Proto-Arawak
word *aphi (cf. also Aikhenvald 2001:176). This is only one possible way of regard-
ing the evolution of classifiers in general, however. Table 4.14 is a summary of lex-
emes and compounds supposedly including the classifier -pi ‘CLF:long & thin’ in
Baure.      -pih                             ‘throat outside all around the neck’

4.7. Noun classification and classifiers
In Baure noun classification is very important. This phenomenon has been studied in
a number of Arawak (Aikhenvald 1994, 2000; Shephard 1997) and Amazonian lan-
guages (Derbyshire & Payne 1990), and many linguists have described the typology
of noun classification in general (Allan 1977; Craig 1986; Dixon 1986; Senft 2000).
The confusion of terminology in this field has been mentioned among others by
Grinevald (2000). Allan’s (1977) overview of noun classification is still referred to as
one of the most useful summaries of noun categorization, particularly concerning
classifiers (e.g. Aikhenvald 2000:6). In his terms Baure has “numeral classifiers”, a
“paradigm type” (Allan 1977:286), classifiers which are “obligatory in many expres-
sions of quantity” (Allan 1977:286). However, the terminology issue is not solved so
easily. Baure classifiers attach to numerals and adjectives; they are part of nouns and
incorporate into verbs. They may also be considered to be “verbal classifiers”, which
do “not classify the verb itself but rather one of the nominal arguments of the verb”
(Grinevald 2000:67). Baure classifiers are attached like agreement markers. Grin-
evald (2000) argues:
         “Classifier systems seem to be secondary grammatical systems [1] which are
         derived from existing lexical material [2] and syntactic constructions [3], and
         which have long or short histories [4], and varying degrees of dynamism built
         into it.” (Grinevald 2000:83)
With reference to this cited text, the main features of Baure classifiers are:
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE                                              139
1. The classifier system in Baure is a secondary categorization, the primary being
grammatical gender (actually feminine animate versus all others, cf. Figure 4.3) and
number.
2. By their form many classifiers have been derived from or are formally identical to
bound nominal roots, among them many plant parts. However, a subset of classifiers
consists of grammaticalized morphemes, mainly monosyllabic, which cannot be re-
lated to any existing lexeme (cf. Figure 4.7).
3. Classification presumably derives from compounding or incorporation (cf. Aik-
henvald 1994:421).
4. Some classifiers are phonetically reduced bound nouns, and it seems as if the older
a classifier is, the less recognizable the relation between a classifier and a noun root.
Therefore, the grammaticalized morphemes may have been derived from nouns as
well; the process only leads further back in history.
    Examples (66) through (71) illustrate how and where classifiers are attached in
Baure. The classifier in all these examples is -po ‘CLF:tiny’, which refers to insects,
fish, and tiny little things, tiny as powder-like material.

In addition to the examples in (66)–(71), classifiers may be part of a noun compound,
as already shown in Tables 4.13 and 4.14. Many nouns referred to by this classifier
include the form -po themselves. This probably goes back to a compound with the
classifier. Examples are insects like yomoep ‘bee’, seeds like čičorop ‘beans’, powder
like šep ‘chivé’ and yinirep ‘dust’, or other animals of the -po-class, like kočopon
‘caiman’.
    The Baure classification system has some features in common with noun class
systems, as shown in Table 4.15. Here Baure is compared with respect to the proper-
ties of noun class and classifier systems suggested by Grinevald (2000:62):

Table 4.15: Distinctions between noun class and classifier systems, with respect to Baure (adapted from
Grinevald 2000:62):Table 4.15 shows that Baure has the following properties of a classifier system: the
classifiers constitute a large number of items and it is a rather open system. The clas-
sifying constituent is independent of other grammatical categories, such as number or
gender. In general, the classifier is not attached to the noun classified, but it may be
when the noun has been derived by compounding. There are, on the other hand, also
some properties that are argued to belong to a noun class system: generally all
counted nouns are classified. The numerals are bound forms and have a classifying
element attached. But in addition, there are also classifiers that do not attach to nu-
merals. The way how classifiers attach to elements in a clause resembles agreement
marking, even though it is more frequently anaphoric. Any counted noun is only as-
signed to one class with no variation. There is also no variation in speech registers.
    An important factor is the assignment of every noun to a definite noun class. This
is a property of a noun class system (cf. Table 4.15). In some Baure phrases it may
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE                                                    141
look as if there are more classifiers referring to the same noun, but in fact this can
easily be explained: In partitive NPs (cf. Table 4.4) the first component may be a
numeral or other modifier with a suffixed classifier. This classifier does not necessar-
ily refer to the noun itself, but possibly only to part of it or to a quantity of it, as illus-
trated in (72):
(72)   apipoe erapoe’/          apičow erapoe’/              apiew erapoe’
       api-poe       erapoe’ api-čow               erapoe’ api-ew          erapoe’
       two-banana plantain two-CLF:circle plantain two-raceme plantain
       ‘two plantains, two circles of plantains, two racemes of plantains’
The first classifier -poe is the one that actually refers to plantains as a single fruit.
The others are only numerals with a suffixed classifier that refers to a certain number
of plantains. While the first part of (72) is one NP, the other two have to be analyzed
as two connected NPs in a partitive construction (here without determiners).
    Classifiers are distinguished for animacy, shape, dimension, texture, function, and
other criteria, but many assignments are not transparent or are only explained by mul-
tiple metaphorical transfer. Baure speakers are very sensitive to mistakes in the use of
classifiers. When I count caimans, for example, and I use the classifier applied to
quadruped animals -a ‘CLF:animal’ (73), then my consultants correct me (74). It has
to be referred to by the classifier -po ‘CLF:tiny’. The word šonoki ‘way, path’ is also
assigned to this and no other class (75).

Another example is how fruits are classified. There are two classifiers -i ‘CLF:fruit &
bird’ for sweet fruit (and birds) and -e ‘CLF:unsweet fruit’. The tree calabash rekirok
‘tutuma’ (76) is referred to by a different classifier than mokovore’ ‘papaya’ (78).
The classifier -e cannot be applied to any unsweet fruit, not even if the fruit is not
ripe yet (77). The ‘pumpkin’ mokovis is assigned to the same class as rekirok ‘tu-
tuma’ (76), but, despite its resemblance to a pumpkin, senti ‘watermelon’ is put into
the class of boats and oval containers, cf. (78) and (79). There is a complete list of
which nouns go into which class in Appendix A.2.

       po-i-š                 senti

Classifiers in Baure can be distinguished morphologically (by their form) and mor-
phosyntactically (where they attach). Most classifiers attach to numerals, but there
are also a number of classificatory bound roots that do not attach to numerals (cf.
4.7.2).","[158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"
"3.8.7. Other particles
There are some other particles in the Baure language, of which some are discussed in
separate chapters and sections. Very important for predicate phrases are preverbal
particles and one postverbal particle (Chapter 7). Preverbal particles seem to take
over part of the tasks of verbal suffixes. In a fixed position preceding the predicate
they have an effect on the predicate phrase. Some of these particles are identical to
adverbs; others have been derived from verbs. The verbal particles express aspect and
mood. Some are used for different kinds of imperatives: cohortative, jussive, and an
intentional imperative for 1SG.
    There is a general negative particle nka ‘NEG’, which can be used for the negation
of all kinds of predicates (cf. 9.2). The negative particle also functions as the negative
copula base, which is non-verbal according to the kind of argument marking: A sub-
ject is marked by an enclitic.
    Further there are interrogative particles ko ‘why’ and kon ‘who, what’. The latter
developed from a phonologically reduced nominalized verb woyikwon (be.I-COP-
NOM1), as described in 9.4.
    Other particles are interjections (8.4.1) and discourse particles (8.4.2).
4. The noun and the noun phrase
In this chapter Baure nominal morphology and the noun phrase (NP) are addressed.
Nouns function as heads of NPs, arguments in a clause. As there are different kinds
of nominal roots, the chapter will be structured as follows: first the bound and free
common nouns are described, including the inherent grammatical categories of nouns
in 4.1–4.3. After a general definition of the boundaries of noun root, stem and base
(4.1), I turn to the categories gender (4.2) and possession (4.3). Then the specific
nominal morphology of the noun base is analyzed in 4.4–4.6. This involves number
marking, diminutive and augmentative, and compounding. Then a description of op-
erations within the noun phrase follows in 4.7–4.10. In this part other specific nomi-
nal roots are introduced: classifying noun roots and classifiers in 4.7, locative noun
roots in 4.8, and modifying noun roots in 4.9. Noun classification, locative construc-
tions, and nominal modification are based on compounding with specific kinds of
nominal roots. One part of the nominal modifiers are adjectives, defined as a sub-
group of nouns in 3.8.3. Even though adjectives are basically nominal, they have
some specific semantic and morphological characteristics that distinguish them from
common nouns, as discussed in 4.8.4 and 4.8.5. Modification, studied in 4.10, only
refers to NP operations. Other uses of modifiers, such as predicates (cf. 5.2) and the
comparative construction (cf. 5.5), are treated elsewhere in the grammar. Determiners
are important grammatical constituents of the NP, analyzed in 8.2.","[131, 132, 133]"
"5.3.4. Locative clauses
Location is indicated by the locative suffix -ye (cf. 4.8). There are no simple juxtapo-
sitions with a locative interpretation, but the copula predicate kwe’ is needed here as
well. In fact locative clauses are just a specific type of existential clauses, as in (106)
and (107):
(106) ne’ niwohiso-ye kowe’ to kopon.
      ne’    ni=wohiso-ye     kowe’ to          kopon
      here 1SG=hand-LOC exist ART               spike
      ‘Here in my hand there is a spike.’                                 [HC-16/8/03-6]
(107) ikiyi-ye te rasroe’ kwe’ te kokon.
      ikiy-i-ye                     te       rasroe’ kwe’ te          kokon
      middle-CLF:fruit&bird-LOC DEM1m orange            exist DEM1m worm
      ‘There is a worm in the middle of the orange fruit.’       [GP-16/9/03-21]
Examples (106) and (107) can be considered to be introductory locative clauses, in
which the subject NP is introduced into the context. In other locative clauses, in par-
ticular those where the NPS precedes the location, the copula predicate is marked by a
personal enclitic, as in (108):
200                                                   BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
(108) nti’ kwoni ne’ sorati-ye.
      nti’ kwo=ni ne’           sorati-ye
      1SG exist=1SG here village-LOC
      ‘I am here in the village.’                                             [HC-3/8/03-1]
Strictly speaking, the emphatic suffix is not attached to the existential predicate kwe’
‘exist’ for emphatic marking (cf. Figure 5.3), but presumably because of a phoneti-
cally minimal form. The same can be observed when personal enclitics are attached
to kwo- ‘exist’ that undergo the process of final vowel elision. The predicate base has
to be at least disyllabic (or with a heavy vowel or diphthong) in its outcome, for
which reason the emphatic suffix is added in some forms. The paradigm of the
marked existential predicate is therefore slightly irregular, as presented in Table 5.10:
          SINGULAR                   PLURAL                     NEUTRAL
 1        kwoni                      kwovi
 2        kwovi                      kwoiy
                                                                kwe’
 3m       kwore’
                                     kwone’
 3f       kwori
Table 5.10: The irregular forms of the existential predicate kwe’ ‘exist’The emphatic suffix has been attached to the forms kwore’ (ko-wo=ro-i’) ‘he is’ and
kwone’ (ko-wo=no-i’) ‘they are’. The form kwovi is ambiguous between ‘you are’ or
‘we are’, because of the morphophonological change of the plosive in -pi ‘2SG’ after
the copula suffix -wo ‘COP’ (cf. 2.5.6).
    Further examples of the copula predicate with person marking are (109)b and
(110)b, each time contrasted to the neutral form in (109)a and (110)a:
(109) a. mes’api-ye kwe’ to misi.

CHAPTER 5 - PREDICATE TYPES AND SPECIFIC PREDICATE CONSTRUCTIONS                   201
Parallel to the negative existential, this type of locative clauses is negated by the
negative particle nka, with the copula suffix and a personal enclitic attached to it.
(111) and (112) are examples:
(111) nti’ nkawoni niweri-ye.
      nti’ nka-wo=ni           ni=weri-ye
      1SG NEG-COP=1SG 1SG=house-LOC
      ‘I was not in my house.’                                       [IM-23/8/03-47]

      ‘He is not in my house.’                                        [JI-22/8/03-61]
Just as in all other types of clauses described above, any aspectual specification has
to be marked: in affirmative clauses the copula predicate base ko- ‘ATTR’ (cf. Figure
5.3) gets the aspectual suffix attached, in negative clauses the negative particle
n(o)ka. In addition, the subject is marked by a personal enclitic. Examples are (113)
and (114):
(113) to mantel ver kwaper mesi-ye
      to     mantel          ver   ko-wapa=ro           mesi-ye

      ‘No idea, I wasn’t there any more.’                              [JP-8/7/04-12]5.3.5. Possession
Possession cannot be expressed by the simple juxtaposition of NPs. There are three
main types of possessive clauses: existential possessive clauses, specialized posses-
sive predicate clauses, and possessive clauses based on a verb.
    Existential possessive clauses make use of the fact that a subclass of nouns is
obligatorily possessed. An existential clause with a possessed noun can then be inter-
preted as a possessive clause, as already illustrated in example (104). More examples
are (115) and (116):
(115) kwe’ nišir peron.
      kwe’ ni=šir       peron
      exist 1SG=son lazybones
      ‘I have a lazy son/ a son who is a lazybones.’                  [RP-1/9/03-50]
(116) teč kwe’ to roea’ ač kwe’ ti ren ač nti’ ver nkawapa to niron.
      teč        kwe’ to       ro=ia’          ač     kwe’ ti      ro=en
      DEM2m      exist ART 3SGm=father and exist DEM1f 3SGm=mother
202                                         BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
       ač     nti’ ver     nka-wapa     to     ni=iron
       and 1SG PERF NEG-COS             ART    1SG=parent
       ‘That one has got a father and a mother, but I don’t have any parents any-
       more.’
The clauses in (115) and (116) could also be translated as ‘there is a son of mine’ and
‘there is a father of his’ etc. The existential clause type can also be used with unpos-
sessed nouns. In this case the possessive pronoun can function as a possessive
marker, as in (117):
(117) kwe’ pitir kahap? – kowe’.
      exist 2SGP manioc exist
      ‘Do you have manioc? – I have (There is).’                        [RP-15/8/03-23]
Just like negative existential clauses in general, the negative particle with certain ver-
bal morphemes can function as a negative copula predicate in existential possessive
clauses, if followed by a possessed noun, cf. (116). However, there is also another
possibility to construct a negative possessive clause, and this is closely related to
equative clauses (cf. 5.3.1). Instead of attaching the copula or another stative suffix to
the negative particle, it can be added to the possessed noun, as in (118):
(118) nti’ nka nihinow, nka niširow, nka nišečenew.
      nti’ nka ni=hino-wo                 nka ni=širo-wo
      1SG NEG 1SG=daughter-COP NEG 1SG=son-COP
       nka    ni=šeče-nev-wo
       NEG    1SG=child-PL-COP
       ‘I don’t have a daughter, I don’t have a son, I don’t have any children.’
                                                                        [JI-22/8/03-52]
The difference between negative equative/attributive and possessive clauses is that in
possessive clauses there is no personal enclitic attached. Compare the different mean-
ings of the two clauses in (119):
         possessive                     equative/attributive
(119) a. nka niširow.                b. nka niširowor.
         nka ni=širo-wo                 nka ni=širo-wo=ro
         NEG    1SG=son-COP             NEG    1SG=son-COP=3SGm
         ‘I don’t have a son.’          ‘He is not my son.’
The only, but substantial difference between the two clauses in (119) is the additional
enclitic -ro ‘3SGm’ in the equative clause (b). However, with an explicit NPS the
equative/attributive predicate can also lack the enclitic.
    Possessive predicate clauses are constructed on the basis of the possessive pro-
nouns, unrelated to the following noun, which may be possessed or unpossessed. The
copula or another verbal suffix is attached to this possessive pronoun, as in (120)
through (122):

      ‘This land is already yours.’                                        [RP-N6-37]
In example (120)b the possessive pronoun is a modifier in contrast to predicate use in
(120)a. The construction is actually an equative clause on the basis of the possessive
pronoun. The possessed element referred to by NPs in (120) through (122) can also
be pronominalized by an enclitic, as in (123):
(123) ver rotirowore’ to hekoewok!
      ver      rotiro-wo=ro-i’             to     hekoewok
      PERF 3SGP-COP=3SGm-EMPH              ART    land
      ‘It is already his, the land!’                                       [RP-N6-35]
The predicate based on a possessive pronoun can also be used without specifying
possession. This is a kind of absolute claim, which is generally only used in the nega-
tive form and together with quantifiers, as in (124) and (125):
(124) nka nipapi, nka ntirow.
      nka ni=pa=pi             nka ntiro-wo
      NEG    1SG=give=2SG NEG 1SGP-COP

      ‘Everything she has she gave them to eat (lit. she made them eat).’[GP-N7-72]
The possessive construction can be negated by the negative particle, as in (124)
above, and in (126) and (127):
(126) nakirok-ye to čintinev nka notirow yaki.
      nakiroko-ye       to     činti-nev nka notiro-wo          yaki

      ‘Last night I didn’t have tobacco any more.’                               [AD/DC-D2-224]
In the place of the copula suffix, other suffixes, such as -wapa ‘COS’ in (127), may
occur directly attached to the possessive pronoun as well. This construction is not
exclusively used with unpossessed nouns, as already indicated by example (122) with
a possessed noun. In (128) the possessed noun rihih’ ‘her horn’ is found in the same
possessive construction:
(128) a ti nor nka ritirow rihi’.148
      a       ti         nor nka ritiro-wo                         ri=hi’
      and DEM1f          deer NEG 3SGfP-COP                        3SGf=horn
      ‘And the deer doesn’t have a horn.’                                         [HC-27/7/04-54]
These constructions with the possessive pronouns used as predicate bases are the
major function of these pronouns, cf. also 8.3.4.
    The possessive pronouns may have been reinterpreted in relation to possessed
nouns: rotir < ro=tir (3SGm=possession) ‘his possession’, just like rower < ro=wer
(3SGm=house) ‘his house’ (cf. 4.3). On the base of this possible noun *-tir ‘posses-
sion’ the verb -kotir- ‘have, possess’ may have been constructed similar to other at-
tributive verb derivations (cf. 6.4.1), such as -kosowe- ‘wear a ring’ < -ko + -sowe’
(ATTR + ring). The verbal possessive construction can be used like any other verb, as
illustrated in (129) and (130):
(129) vikotir soert porok vikač.
      vi=kotir       soert porok vi=kač
      1PL=have       luck never 1PL=go

           ‘He had an arrow that he was shooting little birds with.’                   [RP-N4-8]
In (131) the verb -kotir- ‘have’ is used in a negative clause with the general verbal
negation particle nka ‘NEG’:
(131) nka rikotirow te ka’anonev.
      nka ri=kotiro-wo        te                      ka’ano-nev

      The feminine form derives from the Spanish gender of hurina ‘deer’.
CHAPTER 5 - PREDICATE TYPES AND SPECIFIC PREDICATE CONSTRUCTIONS                       205
The verb -kotir- ‘have’ can also be used like an intransitive verb in a positive or
negative clause, cf. (132) and (133):
(132) nikotirow.
      ni=kotiro-wo
      1SG=have-COP
      ‘I am rich.’                                                  [LO/GP-18/7/04-41]
(133) nka vikotirow, nti’ niwohik.

The adjectives kotiron (have-NOM1) ‘rich’ and mokotiron (PRIV-have-NOM1) ‘poor’
have been derived from the verb -kotir- ‘have’. As privative derivations are always
nominal, the word mokotiron can only be used as a nominal predicate with a subject
enclitic, cf. (134):
(134) nka mokotironowoni nti’.
      nka mo-kotiro-no-wo=ni                nti’
      NEG     PRIV-have-NOM1-COP=1SG 1SG
      ‘It’s not that I don’t have anything.’                            [MD-17/4/06-9]
The attributive verb -kotir- is also used in the question for a possessor ‘whose?’, as
shown in 9.4.4, exemplified here in (135):
(135) kotirowon te senti?
      kotiro-wo-no      te       senti
      have-COP-NOM1 DEM1m watermelon
      ‘Whose is this watermelon?’                                      [MD-17/4/06-45]5.3.6. Summary

5.4. Incorporation
Incorporation (cf. 3.7) in Baure can be distinguished into classifying incorporation
(including argument incorporation) and the incorporation of Ground. Classifying
incorporation is the suffixing of a bound noun or classifier to the verb root, in which
case the absolute suffix -ko ‘ABS’ (or another stem suffix) of the verb base is
dropped150. This is the main morphological distinction from Ground incorporation,
where -ko ‘ABS’ always follows the incorporated element. Arguments and classifiers
can be incorporated into intransitive and transitive verbs, and so can Grounds. In the
simplified Figure 5.4 of the verb base the classifier or noun incorporated is shown to
be part of the stem, which is followed by a stem suffix in some constructions, as will
be illustrated below. The alternations in the specific bases and incorporation types are
not indicated in Figure 5.4.

5.4.1. Classifying incorporation and argument incorporation
The incorporated argument or classifier on intransitive verbs refers to the subject, the
one on transitive verbs to the object. In classifying incorporation on an intransitive
verb, the incorporated element is simply suffixed to the root (cf. Figure 5.4), whereas
on transitive verbs, an incorporated argument always has to be marked by the linker
suffix -a ‘LK’, as contrasted in (136) and (137):

Into the basic verbs -potok- ‘be wet’ (136) and -merok- ‘lick’ (137) is inserted the
incorporated element and the absolute base morpheme -ko ‘ABS’ deleted. In (1) -poe
‘down’ is the locative classifier that refers to the subject to poewok ‘the ground’,
which itself contains the root poe-. In (137) -ko ‘ABS’ is also dropped, the bound
noun -mir ‘face’ has been attached to the root, but it is followed by the linker -a ‘LK’,
as it is a transitive verb.
    Classifying incorporation on intransitive verbs, involving the subject, is less fre-
quent. The incorporated element is either a classifier, such as -poe ‘down’ in (136)
and -se ‘CLF:oval’ in (138), or a body part, which is then always analyzed as part of
the subject, as in (139):
(138) raromosewapa to yašor.                                    < -arom-       ‘drown’

In (139) the subject is analyzed as the possessor of the incorporated body part -po’e
‘head’. When inalienably possessed nouns are incorporated into intransitive verbs,
the classifying relation turns into a part–whole relationship (also cf. Michael 2005).
    The most frequent kind of incorporation is that of an argument into a transitive
verb. The argument may be a bound noun root or a classifier, as in (140) and (141):
151
      There is also a transitive verb -kotič- ‘hurt’.

Both the incorporated bound noun -pes ‘leg’ in (140) and the incorporated classi-
fier -po ‘CLF:tiny’ (141) refer to the object. Even though the object argument may
have been incorporated, it can also occur as an explicit object NP in addition, as in
(141) and in (142)152:
(142) ver nehpoiyaw to nipoiy.                                     < -ehko-      ‘wash’

Repetition of the object argument, as in (142), is generally only used for special em-
phasis. In the case of the incorporation of a classifier, though, the explicit object NP
may specify the referent, as in (141), where the classifier -po ‘CLF:tiny’ can refer to
any kind of powder, which is then specified by šep ‘chivé’. For this reason an explicit
object NP more frequently co-occurs with the incorporated classifier.","[221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231]"
"3.2. Free and bound morphemes
In Baure there are more bound than free morphemes. Free morphemes are nouns,
adjectives, adverbs, clause connectors, determiners, pronouns and particles. Bound
morphemes are all verbs, bound nouns (obligatorily possessed), classifiers, and right-
bound adjectives (cf. 4.9.1). All affixes and clitics are bound morphemes, but most of
them are not exclusively bound to one word class. In general clitics can be distin-
guished from affixes because they are placed on the outside (Halpern 1998:106), as
in Figure 3.1:                               –       –          root         –     –

Figure 3.1: The layering around a word in BaureThe specific kinds of cliticization are discussed in 3.4.
Bounded elements are represented by hyphens, e.g. -piri ‘sibling’ is a left-bound pos-
sessed noun; čo- is a right-bound adjectival root; ko- ‘ATTR’ is differentiated as a
prefix from the suffix -ko ‘ABS’ and from the free interrogative particle ko ‘why’.
Clitics are represented by a = sign in the glosses, e.g. ro= ‘3SGm’ and ni= ‘1SG’.
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES                                  87
3.3. Affixation
There are many processes of affixation which cannot definitively be categorized as
either inflectional or derivational.
    Nouns are distinguished into possessed and unpossessed, where possessed forms
may be derived from the free unpossessed forms or vice versa. This may be consid-
ered an inflectional process, as e.g. in (9):
       unpossessed              possessed
(9)    yaki        →            niyakin
       yaki                     ni=yaki-no
       fire                     1SG=fire-POSS
       ‘fire’                   ‘my fire’
In (9) the possessive suffix -no creates the noun -yakin ‘fire’, which carries the same
meaning as yaki ‘fire’. The difference is the possessability. The new form is likewise
a noun, which is mainly used when the possessor is in focus. Thus the form -yakin
could be considered an inflectional form of yaki. In other possessive derivations the
new form differs in meaning from the source, as in (10):
       possessed                unpossessed
(10)   rowaki         →         ewaki
       ro=waki                  e-waki
       3SGm=hand.palm           UNSP-crotch
       ‘his palm of the hand’   ‘a crotch of branches’
The unspecified possessor marker e- in (10) derives the new lexical base ewaki
‘crotch of branches’ from the possessed noun -waki ‘palm of hand’. How closely
related derivation and inflection are, is shown by the fact that a second interpretation
of rowaki is the translation ‘its crotch of branches’, where ro- ‘3SGm’ refers to a tree
as the possessor. Therefore the meaning predominantly assigned to ewaki is already
present in rowaki ‘his palm of hand/crotch of branches’.
    Another problem is the interpretation of classifier suffixes on various word cate-
gories. When a classifier referring to a noun in the immediate context is attached to a
right-bound adjective, this could be analyzed as agreement, and is thus inflectional
rather than derivational, as in (11):
(11)   to pari činompe
       to      pari čino-mpe
       ART     house old-CLF:flat
       ‘an/the old house’                                              [RP-15/8/03-72]
The classifier -mpe- ‘CLF:flat’ refers to flat objects and houses. In the NP in (11) the
adjective činompe ‘old (house)’ modifies the head noun pari ‘house’ and is marked
by the classifier as a kind of agreement. However, this would presuppose agreement
is generally associated with noun class systems. In 4.7 it is argued that Baure seems
to be on the margin between a classifier and a noun class system. In fact classifiers
are also frequently used for the derivation of new lexemes, as in (12):
88                                                    BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
(12)       kahar            →       kaharopi
           kahar                    kaharo-pi
           cotton                   cotton-CLF:long&thin
           ‘cotton’                 ‘cotton thread’
An even more complicated case is the conversion of verbs into nouns in subordinate
constructions, such as relative and interrogative clauses97 with the nominalizer -no
‘NOM1’. On the one hand this suffix derives nouns from verbs lexically, as in (13):
(13)       nti’ imir nikon.
           nti’ imir niko-no
           1SG very eat-NOM1
           ‘I am a big eater.’                                                        [RP-4/8/03-78]
The same derivational morpheme -no ‘NOM1’ marks the main verb of a relative
clause, as in (14):
           head                      relative clause
(14)       kwe’ tin marip            nikon čintinev.
           kwe’ tin       marip      niko-no činti-nev
           exist DEM3f witch         eat-NOM1 person-PL
           ‘There is that witch that eats people.’                                           [GP-N7-39]
As is obvious from (13) and (14) this nominalization process leads to the same form
nikon ‘eater’, and in both cases the verb is changed into a noun that can be the argu-
ment in a clause. The category-changing effect in the interrogative clause in (15) ap-
pears much more to be an inflectional process, however:
(15)       amo yinikon?                          amo yinikieron?
           amo       yi=niko-no                  amo       yi=nik=ro-no
           why.not 2PL=eat-NOM1                  why.not 2PL=eat=3SGm-NOM1
           ‘Why don’t you (PL) eat?’             ‘Why don’t you eat it?’                      [RP-Q-34]
The verbs in (15) carry the subject proclitic yi- ‘2PL’ and also function as the main
verbs in the interrogative clauses (also cf. (1)). The nominalizer is simply attached to
mark the different clause type. It is also striking that this affix is attached after a per-
sonal enclitic -ro ‘3SGm’ (second question), but in general affixation is internal to
cliticization. Another example of an interrogative clause with this suffix was given in
(1). Haspelmath (1996) argues that the traditional view of derivation referring to the
lexicon and inflection as word-class internal is simplistic, showing that inflectional
affixes may also change the word-class (Haspelmath 1996:43). Therefore it may be
argued that these nominalizing suffixes in Baure are indeed inflectional in some envi-
ronments, but change the word-class as well.
     In this grammar the distinction between inflectional and derivational morphemes
will not be made. The majority of processes can be regarded as derivational in tradi-
tional terms.","[108, 109, 110]"
"4.7.2. Morphosyntactic types of classifiers
Among the grammaticalized and metaphorically extended classifiers there are a few
that do not attach to numerals. These can be considered uncountable classifiers, such
as for example -aso ‘time’ – (94) and (95) – or -pi ‘word(s)’ – (96) and (97) 126:

        po-imir-šo
        one-CLF:face-one4.8. Locative constructions
4.8.1. Locative marking of NPs
In Baure there is one general locative marker -ye ‘LOC’ suffixed to the noun that de-
notes the location. It could be considered a postposition, but this term will not be
used here, because it would rather suggest a whole system with a number of different
postpositions that each stand for a different specific location, which is not the case in
Baure. It could rather be considered a locative case marker, but there are no other
core cases in Baure, so that it does not seem right to call the locative construction a
kind of case127. There is an allomorph of the locative suffix -yi, attached to verbs in
locative subordination (cf. 10.2.5) and interrogative clauses (cf. 9.4.10).
    The locative suffix generally expresses a prototypical location related to the place
it marks. Therefore the translation can be ‘in, on, at’, illustrated in examples (100)
through (102):
(100) pari-ye
      house-LOC
      ‘in the house’
(101) mesi-ye
      table-LOC
      ‘on the table’
(102) yakiso-ye
      yaki-so-ye
      fire-CLF:stick-LOC
      ‘at the stick (of firewood)’
The locative marker is also applied to names, especially place names, as in (103)
through (105):
(103) Kairo-ye
      El.Cairo-LOC
      ‘in El Cairo (village)’127
    Like all the other bound roots for the specific locations, generic -ye may also be considered a kind of
nominal root. This is supported by the fact that there is a homophonous noun root for the specification of
space: -ye(-ye) ‘around’.

(105) kotipakino-ye
      kotip-aki-no-ye
      white-CLF:diameter-NOM1-LOC
      ‘in the Río Blanco (white-water river)’
Examples (100) through (105) demonstrate that -ye can be suffixed to free nouns. It
can also be attached to possessed nouns, as in (106) and (107):
(106) niweri-ye
      ni=weri-ye
      1SG=house-LOC
      ‘in my house’
(107) riwaki-ye
      ri=waki-ye
      3SGf=hand.palm-LOC
      ‘in her hand palm’
The locative suffix is attached to plurals, following the plural suffix (cf. Figure 4.2
above), as in (108):
(108) parineve-ye
      pari-neve-ye
      house-PL-LOC
      ‘in the houses’
All compounds can get locative marking. This holds for compounds of two nouns, as
in (102), (104), and (109); it is true for compounds of a noun and a classifier, as in
(105) and (110); it also holds for compounds of adjectives with a noun stem or classi-
fier, as in (98):
(109) tikorokawoko-ye
      tikorok-a-woko-ye
      guava-LK-tree-LOC
      ‘in the guava tree’

152                                                BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
In general the locative marker refers to the most expected topological relation, as in
many Pidgin and Creole languages which have only one general preposition128 (my
own research, not published). The locative NP can be interpreted as stative or dy-
namic, which is dependent on the predicate in the clause and its status, and in other
cases also on the meaning of other nouns or adverbs in the clause. In (112) through
(114) there are more complex examples where the meaning of the locative marker
interacts with the meaning of the predicate or another noun in the clause. All three
examples show a dynamic interpretation of the locative form.

      ni=ašono-no     ni=weri-ye

      and 3SGf=jump-CLF:water-COP river-LOC
      ‘And she jumped into the river.’                                                 [GP-N1/I-20]
However, if the location is specified or deviates from the prototypical or expected
topological relation, additional locative noun stems are needed. There are two ways
of constructing a specified locative phrase: The most common kind is a compound, in
which N1 is the place and N2 the specified locative noun stem. The second kind is a
partitive NP (cf. Figure 4.5) with the first NP referring to the specific location and the

The bound form -api ‘underside’ in (116) is possessed, and the possessor marker ro-
‘3SGm’ agrees with the noun to siy ‘the chair’, so that the locative relation becomes
clear.
    In many cases it is possible to construct both, the compound and the partitive
locative NP, with the same noun stem. In some cases the specific place noun stem
cannot be bound into a compound, so that only the partitive construction can be used.
This is true for the noun ani ‘sky’, also used to refer to the space above an object. As
an obligatorily free form it cannot be bound into a compound, as demonstrated in
(117) in comparison to (118):
(117) *siyani-ye             BUT:     (118)    ani-ye to siy
      siy-ani-ye                               ani-ye           to     siy

                                               (lit. ‘in the sky of the chair’)
The main general locative noun stems are listed in Table 4.19.

Table 4.19: Locative noun stemsThe forms ačiwani ‘different place’, -širiwani ‘behind’ and -poewani ‘next to’ both
include the morpheme -wani, which seems to mean something like a general ‘place’
or ‘space’. The basic forms -širi ‘behind’ and -poe ‘down’ are the ones incorporated
into verbs. The form -imir- ‘in front’ is derived from the same bound noun stem for
the body part -imir ‘face’. The same form can also be incorporated into verbs. The
bound root -še is derived from a part of a tree, namely the ‘tree branch’. Most of the
place noun stems are also used as classifiers or at least as bound roots that can be
incorporated into verbs and attached to adjectives. These roots are generally not at-
tached to numerals and quantifiers and the word po- ‘other’.
    The two spatial noun stems -šinie ‘pointed end’ and -čipi ‘top, roof, back’ show
different behaviour with body parts: they construct inverse compounds. Unexplica-
bly, the bound forms occur as N1 in a compound with a body part, whereas they are
the head N2 in compounds with other nouns. Examples (119) and (120) are inverse
compounds with body parts, which can be compared to (121) and (122):

One further kind of locative construction is based on an adjective: ikiy-CLF-ye ‘in the
middle of’. There is always a classifier attached to the stem ikiy- ‘middle’; altogether
it is marked by locative -ye, as in (123):
(123) ikiyaki-ye
      ikiy-aki-ye
      middle-CLF:diameter-LOC
      ‘in the middle of the lagoon/river/etc.’
The position of the locative NP in a clause is discussed in 9.1.3.","[171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176]"
"4.9.1. Class I: Right-bound roots
The small closed class I consists of right-bound roots, which have to be completed
with a classifier or bound noun stem in order to form a word. Also numerals and the
pronoun ‘other’ belong to this class. One semantic group of these bound forms are
the adjectives of dimension in Table 4.20.
    There are three distinctions of size: čo- ‘big’, hew- ‘medium size’, and ti- ‘small’.
Length has two degrees: pero- ‘long’ and mohi- ‘short’. The basic morpheme čo-
‘big’ served as the source of many lexemes that involve size or a big amount, such as

Table 4.20: Adjectives of dimensionAll classifiers listed in Tables 4.16 through 4.18 can be attached to bound roots. We
are in fact dealing with the morphological process of compounding, with the addi-
tional fact that now we also have a bound root on the left. This fact distinguishes
them morphologically from the majority of nouns. Examples are (135) through (137):

Adjectives with classifiers can function as modifiers in an NP, as in (135) and (136),
in which case the classifier is an agreement marker that agrees with the modified
head noun. On the other hand, the same forms can also function as nouns themselves,
especially those with “repeater” classifiers, as (137).
   The degree of tallness is expressed in a specific way for human beings, i.e. not
with the human classifier attached to the bound roots for size (čo- ‘big’, ti- ‘small’,
and hew- ‘medium size’). The word čon exists and means ‘friend, brother, compan-
158                                              BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
ion’; it may have been derived from the root čo- ‘big’ and the human classifier -no130.
The two other adjectives ti- ‘small’ and hew- ‘medium size’ have not been found
directly combined with the human classifier. Instead, the adjectival roots get the
bound nominal root -šie’ ‘vertical size’ attached, as illustrated in (138).
(138) čišie’, tišie’, hewošie’
      či-šie’,         ti-šie’,       hewo-šie’
      big-vert.size small-vert.size medium-vert.size
      ‘tall, small, medium size (person)’
The adjectives in (138) are restricted to human referents. The bound root -šie’ ‘verti-
cal size’ has caused vowel harmony in the compound čišie’ (not *čošie’). The vowel
o of čo- ‘big’ is a weak vowel and gets generally replaced by the first vowel of the
classifier or a vowel inserted in harmony with the following syllable. Another impor-
tant semantic group in class I are adjectives of age, represented in Table 4.21:

                                                     ‘new (thread)’
Table 4.21: Adjectives of ageThe adjective čino- ‘old’ can be used with humans and also inanimates, whereas
koto- ‘new’ is not used with humans in the sense of ‘young’. The bound root mono-
‘young’ is generally not used except for when referring to the childhood days. Age
can also be expressed by specific adjectives that can only be used with animates, or
mainly humans, which are ane’ ‘old (person)’ and monči ‘young, child’. Both are
absolute forms discussed in the next section. The word monči has probably been de-
rived from mono- ‘young’ and the diminutive suffix -či.
    Numerals and the root po- ‘other’ are also part of the class I adjectives. There are
only three numerals131, to which the classifier has to be attached. However, the
speakers of Baure have borrowed the numbers above three from Spanish, and they
attach the classifier to the loans as well, as illustrated in (139):
(139) pompeš pari, apimpe pari, mpompe pari, kwatrompe pari, sinkompe parinev.
      po-mpe-š         pari api-mpe       pari mpo-mpe            pari
      one-CLF:flat-one house two-CLF:flat house three-CLF:flat    house130
   It may likewise be the nominalizing suffix -no ‘NOM1‘ that derived this lexeme.
131
   “Most [Arawak] languages have just the numbers ‘one’ (proto-Arawak *pa-) and ‘two’ (Proto-Arawak
*(a)pi and *yama: David L. Payne 1991). It is common to use numeral *pa- ‘one’ in the function of an
indefinite pronoun ‘one, someone’, ‘another’” (Aikhenvald 1999:85).

Table 4.23: Other bound adjectival rootsIn addition to adjectives of dimension, age, and numerals there are a few other bound
roots in this class, as listed in Table 4.23. There may be some more bound roots that
did not occur in my data. The bound root heno- ‘good’ has been included here, as it
can be the base of a non-verbal predicate, like other adjectives. However, the classifi-
ers are not attached to heno- like to other adjectival roots, but the absolute form
henok ‘good’ is preferred in attributive constructions.
    Finally, with some variation, there are also two loanwords from Spanish used as
bound roots. These are vero- ‘green’ and asolo- ‘blue’. They are e.g. found in combi-
nation with the classifier for clothes and textile -mo, as shown in (140).
(140) verom, asolom
      vero-mo               asolo-mo
      green-CLF:woven       blue-CLF:woven
      ‘green, blue (piece of textile)’4.9.2. Class II: Absolute forms
Another semi-closed class of adjectives are the absolute forms, comparable to (de-
rived) unpossessed nouns:
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE                                                   161
 form          meaning       comments
 monik         pretty        derived from the bound root moni- ‘pretty’
 čonok         big           from the bound root čo- ‘big’
 maiyok        much          from the adverb maiy ‘much’
                             derived from a bound root heno-, not used together with
 henok         good          classifiers, but is rather incorporated into verbs or used as a
                             predicate
 hetirik       empty
 yak           ripe          there is also the derived form yakon ‘ripe’
 ane’          old           only used with animates, predominantly humans
 kahamor       greedy        from verb -kahamor- ‘keep to oneself’
 powor         poor          loan from Spanish pobre ‘poor’
 sons          ‘stupid’      loan from Spanish sonso ‘stupid’
 pikor         ‘rascal’      loan from Spanish pícaro ‘rascal’
Table 4.24: Absolute adjectivesThe members of this class are semantically diverse. Some forms have been derived
from the class I bound forms, originally possibly all of them. The adjective monik
‘pretty’ has been derived from the bound root of class I, moni- ‘pretty’, by adding the
absolute suffix -ko. The adjective čonok ‘big’ has also been derived from čo- ‘big’.
The suffix -no in čonok ‘big’ may either be the nominalizer -no ‘NOM1’, or it is an
epenthetic syllable. However, it has been lexicalized in this form and is an alternative
to the bound form that is always marked with a classifier. Other absolute forms do
not include the absolute suffix at all. Some are identical to verb stems, such as yak
‘ripe’; others are identical to nouns, such as ane’ ‘old (person)’ which is more often
used as a noun than as a modifier. The major characteristic of this class of adjectives
is the fact that they always remain unchangeable. The adjectives in Table 4.24 can all
stand alone, also in headless clauses or as nominal heads themselves. No classifier or
bound noun root can be incorporated into these forms. These absolute forms are
mainly used as predicates in a clause, as in (141):
(141) monik to pičahahi.
      monik     to       pi=čahahi
      pretty    ART      2SG=hair
      ‘Your hair is pretty.’                                                [RP-15/8/03-99]4.9.3. Class III: Derived adjectives
The largest number of adjectives is derived by means of the nominalizer -no ‘NOM1’
and/or with the prefixes ko- ‘ATTR/with’ or mo- ‘PRIV/without’. The open class III
can always get new members simply by deriving them from verbs or other nouns.
The derivational process is in fact a kind of nominalization, but the forms discussed
here are used as attributive and predicative adjectives. Again, the derived forms can
be split into slightly different types.

First of all there are the colour adjectives. Except for the two bound loans vero-
‘green’ and asolo- ‘blue’, colour adjectives only exist in derived form, and are listed
in Table 4.25:

                                               ‘yellow (snake e.g.)’
Table 4.25: Derived adjectives: colour termsSome of the colour terms include the lexicalized attributive prefix ko- or privative
mo-. All the forms end in a sequence of the absolute suffix -ko and the nominal-
izer -no ‘NOM1’ (in the form -kon). As in verbs (cf. 5.4), classifiers or other bound
noun roots can be incorporated in the slot of the absolute suffix. This is done fre-
quently for agreement, so that the colour terms appear as moseromon ‘red cloth’ or
moseropin ‘red thread’ etc. Another example is given in (142):
(142) to pari kotisompen.
      to      pari      kotiso-mpe-no
      ART     house     green-CLF:flat-NOM1
      ‘the green house’                                               [MD-7/8/03-17]
Some derived adjectives include the attributive prefix. The attributive prefix ko-
‘ATTR’ generally derives verbs from nouns, as e.g. -kahaše- ‘wear a hat (lit. be with
hat)’, which was derived from -haše ‘hat’. The adjectives are then derived from these
verbs by nominalization. One example is kopirokon ‘hot’ in (143):
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE                                                   163

      ‘hot (lit. with heat)’                   ‘She has fever’         [LO/GP-15/7/04-4]
Some of these attributes are composed in a similar way, even though there may not
exist a related verb, in kompekon ‘flat’ in (144):
(144) kompekon
      ko-mpe-ko-no
      ATTR-CLF:flat-ABS-NOM1
      ‘flat’
Many adjectives of class III have been derived by attaching the privative prefix mo-
‘without’ as listed in Table 4.26. Some of these forms are more lexicalized than oth-
ers. In 5.2.3 I show that the bases derived from verbs or nouns with the prefix mo-
‘PRIV’ are always non-verbal.

Table 4.26: Derived adjectives: privativeNew forms of this class are derived from stative verbs by means of nominalization.
The verb -tiri ‘know’ can be nominalized as tirin ‘knowing, capable’. This form is
negated as motirin (cf. Table 4.6). The nominal form is even used more often than the
verb. It expresses an ongoing state rather than a stative verb. The example is (145):
164                                              BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA

It is striking that semantic antonyms are not necessarily members of the same class.
While ‘clean’ is the bound root heho- of class I, its antonym ‘dirty’ is a derived ad-
jective of class III: topopokon. In both forms classifiers can be incorporated, e.g. he-
hom ‘clean clothes’ and topopomon ‘dirty clothes’. The difference is that there is no
free form without the classifier of heho- ‘clean’. Another antonym is sap ‘left’ and
koyan ‘right’, the first being member of class II, the latter of class III. Many basic
adjectives are also part of class III, such as taste attributes, listed in Table 4.27:
 form                          meaning
 bihkon                        bitter

Table 4.27: Derived adjectives of taste
4.9.4. Nominal properties of adjectives
As adjectives are modifiers with mainly nominal behaviour, their nominal properties
are summed up here. Adjectives can themselves be used as arguments in a clause.
There they can get plural marking, diminutive/augmentative, locative, and distribu-
tive suffixes. Finally, when used as a predicate, an adjective is turned into a non-
verbal predicate with subject marking by encliticization, just like nouns. These prop-
erties are now exemplified briefly.
    Adjectives of all morphological classes are frequently used as arguments and not
as modifiers in a clause. An example is (146):
(146) “boen,” nokiew-hi to powor, noepikopaw.
      boen       no=kiewo=hi       to     powor      no=ipiko-pa-wo
      INTJ       3PL=say=QUOT ART poor               3PL=be.afraid-GO-COP
      ‘ “Well,” said the poor; they were getting afraid.’              [GP-N7-69]
Adjectives are often used as NPs when they refer to a before mentioned argument
anaphorically, as in (147):
(147) nakirok-ye tič eton moemori kwe’ tič ripiri rokotiron teč riavinon ač tič powor
      rikotorekpa …
      nakirok-ye tič       eton     moemori kwe’ tič               ri=piri

        3SGf=have-NOM1 DEM2m               3SGf=husband   and   DEM2f    poor

       ri=kotorek-pa
       3SGf=work-GO
       ‘Once upon a time a widowed woman had a sister, whose husband was rich,
       and the poor one (the widow) went to work … (at her sister’s)’ [RP-N4-1]
The NP in (147) tič powor ‘the poor one’ refers back to the NP tič eton moemori ‘the
widowed woman’. The plural morpheme -nev can also be attached to adjectives
(compare 4.4.3), as in (148) and (149):
(148) ti’anev
      ti-a-nev
      small-CLF:animal-PL
      ‘little animals (dogs, pigs, etc.)’                          [LO-29/8/03-105]
(149) nti’ nimon paš to čačanev.
      nti’ ni=imon po-a-š                 to           č-a-ča-nev

      ‘I buy one of the big ones (pigs).’                         [LO/GP-18/7/04-92]
Adjectives can have augmentative or diminutive marking, as in (149) and (150):
(150) ti’ači
      ti-a-či
      mall-CLF:animal-DIM
      ‘very small animal’                                          [LO-29/8/03-106]
The locative marker is also attached to adjectives, as in (151):
(151) hamorokino-ye kwe’ him čopoča.
      hamoro-ki-no-ye                   kwe’ him čo-po-ča
      black-CLF:contents-NOM1-LOC exist fish big-CLF:tiny-AUG
      ‘In the Río Negro (lit. black river) there are very big fishes.’ [JC-18/9/03-26]
The adjective hamorokino-ye in (151) can be analyzed as a noun, but the form is a
derived adjective marked by the classifier -ki ‘contents’. In one example (152) the
locative suffix was even attached to the modifier within the NP, even though the head
noun is already marked:
(152) ne’ vimiro ne’ kastaroko-ye čiki-ye.
      ne’    vi=imo=ro          ne’    kastaroko-ye čo-iki-ye.
      here 1PL=put=3SGm here bag-LOC                big-CLF:net-LOC
      ‘Here we put it into the big bag.’                           [JC-18/9/03-58]
The locative marker -ye in (152) is attached to the noun kastarok(o) ‘bag’ and to the
following modifier čiki ‘big (net)’. Perhaps the modifier should be analyzed as an
adjective NP which functions as an apposition to the head noun. The bound adjective
root ikiy- ‘middle’, generally is marked locative, as in (153):
166                                                    BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA

      ikiy-a-ye
      middle-CLF:animal-LOC
      ‘in the middle (here: of the egg)’                                               [GP-16/9/03-28]
The distributive suffix -he can be attached to nouns (cf. 4.8.3) and verbs. It can also
be attached to adjectives:
(154) to hir čo-he                                                  [RP-4/8/03-80]
      to      hir   čo-he
      ART     man big-DISTR
      ‘the man is big’ (my consultant translated: ‘a man who eats much’)
Nominal predicates are distinct from verbs, because they get the subject encliticized
(cf. 5.2.1). This also holds for all adjectives. When they are used as predicates and
have subject marking, the same rules apply as for nouns. One marked adjectival

Adjectives also share some properties with verbs. The application of the approxima-
tive132 suffix is only found on verbs. Furthermore, only verbs and adjectives can be
nominalized by the morpheme -pi ‘QNOM’, quality nominalization. Finally, adjec-
tives are reduplicated for emphasis, just like verbs (and some adverbs).
    The approximative suffix -so is described as a verbal morpheme with a meaning
like ‘to be about to’ (cf. 6.3.3). It is never attached to nouns, but can appear with ad-
jectives, as in (156) through (158):
(156) persopa

      ‘long(ish) (e.g. mate133)’                                                          [GP-7/8/04-5]

      In Tariana the approximative is applied to verbs, nouns and adjectives (Aikhenvald 2003:58–59).

The approximative morpheme -so is attached in the slot of the absolute suffix -ko;
they are mutually exclusive.
   The quality nominalizer can derive abstract nouns from adjectives and verbs (cf.
10.2.4). It is comparable to the English suffix -ness. This nominalizer -pi ‘QNOM’ is
mainly attached to adjectives of classes I and II. In the derivational process some-
times the linking morpheme -ro134 is added. The examples in my data are listed in

Both examples (159) and (160) are class III adjectives and have been derived from
verbs. Therefore the reduplication can be regarded as a verbal property maintained in
the nominalized form. Adjectives of class I and II are generally not reduplicated.
They get diminutive or augmentative suffixes instead.","[178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]"
"9.1.1. The subject argument
In general the subject of an intransitive predicate follows the predicate, as demon-
strated in (4). However, a transitive verb may also be followed by only one argument
that refers to the object, so that we cannot determine subjecthood on the basis of the
position alone. In this respect (4) is contrasted with (5):
(4)     roharow to yakis.
        ro=haro-wo              to             yakis
        3SGm=burn.intr-COP      ART            firewood
        ‘The firewood is burning.’                                       [RP-5/7/04-62]
(5)     rokow to yakis.
        ro=kow            to     yakis
        3SGm=burn.tr      ART    firewood
        ‘He is burning the firewood.’                                    [RP-5/7/04-63]
The verb -har- ‘burn’ is intransitive and refers to the burning material as a subject, as
represented in (4), in which to yakis ‘the firewood’ is the explicit subject NP. The
CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES                                             333
clause in (5) looks nearly identical in its structure, but the different verb -kow- ‘burn’
is transitive and the explicit NP refers to the object in this example. The different role
of the explicit argument is not apparent from either the position of the argument or
the cross-reference on the verb when there is only one explicit argument.
     The order VSO is generally preferred, especially when no human argument is
involved. In the following example a speaker corrected the order to VSO, when I
tried to express it in VOS:
        *V           O                         S
(6)     *nonik       to rosoki                 to aren.

(7)     nonik     to aren                 to rosoki.

In narratives, however, I also found examples with VOS order, particularly when
there is a human or animate argument involved, so that the roles of the arguments can
be understood from the context. In (8) the agent teč šiye’ ‘the fox’ is animate and a
main character in the narrative.

For special emphasis the subject NP frequently precedes the predicate. This mainly
accounts for verbal predicates (especially transitive ones) and is found when the sub-
ject changes. As there are no other switch-reference markers, the position of the sub-
ject is the pragmatic means of marking the change of the subject.
                   S                  V                             O

Nominal NPs should be distinguished from pronominal NPs. If the subject is referred
to by a pronoun, the pronoun generally precedes the predicate. The personal pro-
nouns are used for special emphasis, which is why they often precede the predicate.

Personal pronouns are not used frequently, and there are more examples with the
speech act participants, especially nti’ ‘1SG’ and piti’ ‘2SG’ than there are with 3SG or
3PL pronouns. (10) and (11) are examples:
(10)   “noka!” rokičowor-hi, “koe’ piti’ pinikoni!”
       noka ro=kičo-wo=ro=hi                     koe(č)       piti’   pi=niko=ni
       NEG    3SGm=say.do-COP=3SGm=QUOT because               2SG     2SG=eat=1SG
       ‘ “No!” he said. “Because you eat me!” ’                           [RP-N3-118]
(11)   nti’ enevere nkotorek.
       nti’ enevere ni=kotorek
       1SG tomorrow 1SG=work
       ‘I work tomorrow.’                                                 [RP-N11-13]
In (10) the pronoun piti’ ‘2SG’ precedes the verb pinikoni ‘you eat me’, in which the
subject is also marked by the proclitic pi- ‘2SG’. It is also possible to find an adverb
in between the subject pronoun and the verb, as shown in (11). This is also the posi-
tion of the negative particle nka when the predicate is negated.
    In the case of non-verbal predicates in juxtaposition with the subject NP (cf. 5.3.1
and 5.3.2), it seems to be the unmarked case when the subject pronoun precedes the
predicate. This also means that when the pronoun follows the predicate, this puts
special emphasis on the predicate, as in (12):
(12)   “monik piti’, čapak,” rokičowor-hi.
       monik     piti’ čapak        ro=kičo-wo=ro=hi
       pretty    2SG spider         3SGm=say.do-COP-3SGm=QUOT
       ‘ “You are pretty, spider”, he said.’                               [SIL-N1-56]
Even though preverbal particles have much in common with adverbs in general, sub-
ject personal pronouns tend to occur after a preverbal particle, thus in between the
particle and the main verb, as in (13). The same holds for complement constructions
(as described in 11.3.4), which must have been the source of preverbal particle con-
structions as well, so that it is not surprising that the constructions are similar.

In Baure there are two possible object arguments, generally referred to as “direct”
and “indirect” in the linguistic literature. However, which one is the “direct” or “indi-
rect” depends on being human or not, not on any kind of “directness”. In general the
concepts of recipient and patient are used in this grammar to classify the objects se-
mantically. In addition there are oblique objects, which are discussed in 9.1.3. Usu-
ally a verb occurs together with only one object NP. The object NP follows the verb
(cf. (5)), and generally also the subject NP (7). Therefore VSO is the least marked
CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES                                        335
situation. In (14) an example is added with one subject NP and one object NP,
whereas in (15) there are two explicit object NPs.

       ‘I want to give the book to my sister so that she reads it.’           [RP-P1-1]
In (15) there are two explicit object NPs, related to the ditransitive verb -pa- ‘give’.
The order is patient – O(P) – before recipient – O(R) –, which is exactly the inverse
from the fixed order of personal enclitics on the verb (cf. 5.1.3 and Figure 5.1). Two
enclitics are only attached if one of them is a speech act participant, but the order is
then always recipient before patient, as e.g. in nipapir (1SG=give=2SG=3SGm) ‘I give
it to you’.
     It is also possible to antepose an explicit object argument to the predicate for spe-
cial emphasis. In general, the position directly following the predicate can also be
used to emphasize the object argument (at least with human agents, as shown in (8)),
but especially with causative verbs, where the object is identical to the causee, i.e. the
real agent of the action, the object NP can be anteposed to the whole predicate. This
downplays the role of the causer as the actual subject of the construction, as in (16):
       O                          V
(16)   ti nihin                   nimokotorekowori.

Personal pronouns are generally not used for reference to an object. In all the data of
narratives and conversation there are only two examples of pronouns referring to an
object. In one case the object pronoun follows the predicate (17), which seems to be
the least marked position. In (18) there is an example of the object pronoun preceding
the predicate, but it should rather be considered as a case of left-dislocation for prag-
matic purposes, as the pronoun is followed by a short pause.

The main kind of oblique argument is the locative NP marked by the locative suf-
fix -ye. Besides this there is sometimes an unmarked NP added as if it were an object
NP, but in fact this is an oblique argument that refers to a cause. This is analyzed as a
kind of juxtaposition, especially because the causal NP is frequently a nominalized
predicat. This is described in 10.2.4. In this section only locative arguments are de-
scribed. The locative argument is treated like other locative or temporal adverbials,
and the position is more free than that of the arguments of the predicate. The least
marked order is considered to be the one following the main arguments. In (19) the
locative argument follows the object NP:
         V             O         LOC
(19)     vapa          yakis     toerko-ye.

For emphasis on the location there are two strategies: the locative NP occurs in left-
dislocation, as in (20), or the location occurs directly after the predicate, as in (21).

In the left-dislocation in (20) the main clause follows the locative argument without
any further changes in the order predicate-subject. In (21) the locative argument fol-
lows directly after the verb, and the subject follows after the location. The locative
argument frequently follows verbs of motion that already imply a location, but less
frequently a subject NP follows the location.
    The locative argument can also be more complex with a possessive NP that is
simply juxtaposed to the location without any further marking (22). This may also
play a role in respect to the restriction of main arguments following the locative ar-
gument. Consider example (22):
CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES                                       337

The verbs in (21) and (22) and other verbs of motion are generally intransitive. With
transitive verbs the subject NP usually does not occur after the location, but object
NPs follow frequently, as in (23):
       V                     LOC                  O

In clauses with the non-verbal predicate kwe’ ‘exist’ the subject can follow the loca-
tion, as in (21), but it is a relatively more marked situation, as shown in the following
example:
       V       LOC               S
(24)   kwe’    ne’ Trinida-ye    ti nihin.

       in Guayamarin there are five of my children.’               [DC-7/3/06-27–29]
In (24) it is apparent that for focus on the location in the first clause the subject NP ti
nihin ‘my daughter’ can follow the location, but in the following two clauses the
more general order of the arguments is used, namely LOC-predicate-subject.
    Finally, there may also be two locative arguments following another, one specify-
ing the other, as in (25):

9.2. Negation
In Baure there are two main strategies of negation: one involves particles that precede
the negated element (periphrastic negation), and the other one the privative prefix
mo- (morphological negation). Periphrastic negation is the general way to negate
propositions; morphological negation is not used so productively and cannot negate
every verb, but only a restricted number of lexicalized verbs, nouns, and adjectives
(cf. 4.9.3 and 5.2.3).
    Starting with periphrastic negation, there are at least four different negative parti-
cles: nka ‘no(t)’, porok ‘never’, verek ‘not ever’, and wokow ‘not yet’. All of these
particles have a different etymology and are described one by one. What they all have
in common is the fixed position preceding the verb or non-verbal predicate. In this
and other respects negative particles are just like the other preverbal particles de-
scribed in Chapter 7. So we have the negation pattern NEG PRED.
    The negative particle precedes the negated element directly. There is a hierarchy
in the specificity of the negative particles: nka is the general negative particle, and the
others − porok ‘never’, verek ‘not ever’, and wokow ‘not yet’ are more specific.","[354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360]"
"10.2.1. Relative clauses with -no ‘NOM1’
The main nominalizers are the following: participant -no, action -čo, and product -ri.
These three nominalization types are used for RCs which refer to the core arguments
in the main clause, an event or the result of an event. In all three cases the predicate
may or may not show subject cross reference. The marking determines the semantic
relation of the relativized element and its head. If there is no subject cross-reference
on the subordinate and nominalized predicate, then the head is identical with the sub-
ject in the RC. This can be seen in (51), in which the nominalized predicate epenon
400                                        BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
‘dead’ may be regarded as a RC ‘that is dead’ which shows no subject marking (cf.
also (55) below). The reason is that the subject of the RC is nor ‘deer’, which is iden-
tical to the head of the RC. If there is subject cross-reference on the predicate in the
RC, then the subject in the RC is different from the head. This is demonstrated in
(50), where the RC nikasačon ‘that I hunted’ shows subject marking, because the
head nor ‘deer’ is different from the subject ni- ‘1SG’ of the RC.
    There can also be object marking on the nominalized predicate of the RC. We
actually find all combinations: subject and object marking (52), subject and no object
marking (53), no subject but object marking (54), and finally neither (55). If there is
object cross-reference in the RC, then this replaces the participant nominalization
morpheme. The nominal form is thus “invisible”. Only when there is no object mark-
ing the subordination becomes apparent, otherwise it remains implicit. The object
may either be an additional object of the RC or an argument of the main clause that is
referred back to in the form of “pronoun retention” (Payne 1997:331–32). For each
kind of argument marking there are examples in (52) through (55). Relative clauses
will be shown with and without the indefinite pronoun to ka ‘something, someone’,
which generally functions as a head of the RC. There will be modifying and headless
relative clauses in the examples. The semantic role of the head in the RC is indicated
in the line above in parenthesis. The abbreviation “head=” means that the RC itself is
the head.

       ‘There is that witch that eats people.’                              [GP-N4-39]
The verb -nik- ‘eat’ has been turned into the noun nikon ‘eater’ in (55). The subject of
the RC is also the agent of this predicate derived by what I have called participant
nominalization. In the independent nominalization process for deriving nominals it is
most frequently an agentive nominalizer (cf. 5.2.4), but not exclusively. The same
morpheme has many applications and therefore it is difficult to tack down its mean-
ing. The participant nominalizer is used in imperative, interrogative, counterfactual
conditional, and relative clauses.
    Participant nominalization is the dominant way of marking a subordinate predi-
cate. I want to stress again the change of the predicate into a nominal form. This has
the consequence that this nominal predicate can again function or be used and
marked like other nominal predicates. If we take into account what has been de-
scribed in Chapter 5, then it is obvious that nominal predicates can have all mor-
phemes attached, but the non-stative ones are linked with the morpheme -a. The cop-
ula -wo and other stative morphemes can be attached without the linker. The meaning
can be very complicated when this is applied to a relative clause. However, there was
already one example of this in (53). The predicate rimonow ‘that which she puts’ is
marked with the copula suffix -wo. The meaning of the copula in that example is not
clear to me, though it may be related to stative aspect.
    (56) is an example of a nominalized predicate in a relative clause with subject
marking and a non-stative morpheme attached: -pik ‘COME’, preceded by the
linker -a.
(56)   ver rikopoek teč ramonapik rinik.

The preceding examples were exclusively of verbal predicates in the RCs, but also
non-verbal predicates can, less frequently, be the predicate in the RC. There are only
a few examples, however, as generally the RC refers to some type of active event and
non-verbal predicates are stative. The following example (57) is part of a longer sen-
tence that introduces the characters in a narrative. I consider kotišen ne’ ‘this size’ to
be a RC, but if the adverb ne’ was missing it could not be distinguished from a sim-
ple modifier juxtaposed to its noun referent teč rišir ‘her son’.

The marker -no is used here to derive the modifier kotišen ‘like this size’ (cf. 4.9.3),
it is not a subordinator. In (58) the non-verbal predicate in the RC in the question is
anew ‘who is very old’. There is no argument marking on the subordinate predicate.

(58)       kon       ti anew ne’ sorati-ye?

Non-verbal predicates in subordination are difficult to identify because first of all, no
nominalization has to change the form of the predicate, and second, non-verbal
predicates are almost always intransitive. If there were marking of a subject, then this
would be done with an enclitic, which obeys different rules than the proclitic on
verbs and is not obligatory. Even though it could be possible that a non-verbal predi-
cate occurs in a RC that refers to an object head, I cannot find such an example in the
data.","[421, 422, 423, 424]"

Compare now interrogative clauses with transitive verbs clitic attachment, as illus-
trated with the transitive verb -weč- ‘fight’ in (70) and (71):
(70)   kori piwečin ti pihin?
       ko=ri          pi=weči-no     ti       pi=hin
       why=3SGf       2SG=fight-NOM1 DEM1f    2SG=daughter
       ‘Why do you fight with your daughter?’                          [DC-15/4/06-50]
(71)   kori imir piwečin(i)?
       ko=ri         imir pi=weči-no
       why=3SGf      very 2SG=fight-NOM1
       ‘Why do you fight with her very much?’                          [DC-15/4/06-51]
That the object clitic -ri ‘3SGf’ is attached to the particle ko, whereas the subject pi-
‘2SG’ is procliticized to the verb, is demonstrated in (71), where the intensity adverb
imir ‘very’ is inserted between the particle and the verb (compare (68) above). Vowel
assimilation also supports this analysis, as shown in (72):
(72)   koro pikomorikon(i)?
       ko=ro        pi=ikomoriko-no
       why=3SGm 2SG=kill-NOM1
       ‘Why did you kill it/him?’                                      [DC-16/3/06-42]
The vowel-initial verb -ikomorik- ‘kill’ leads to the assimilation of the vowel of the
subject proclitic pi- ‘2SG’ in (72).
    The following example illustrates that indirect questions are simply subordinate
interrogative clauses within a single sentence (compare to 10.2.8).
(73)   nka nčow to ka koni ehevipoekowon!
       nka ni=čo-wo             to     ka ko=ni ehevipoeko-wo-no

       ‘I don’t know why I fell down.’                     [RP-22/7/04-63]
It is also possible to construct an unspecified question for a cause as a general one: ko
rokien? (ko 3SGm=kie-NOM1) or ko rokiewon? (ko 3SGm=kie-COP-NOM1) ‘Why?’,
which are constructed on the base of the empty verb root -k(i)e- ‘EV’ (74).
(74)   nka nki’inow pihekpani! – ač ko rokien?
       nka ni=ki’ino-wo        pi=ihek-pa=ni       ač       ko       ro=kie-no

       ‘I don’t want you to comb me! – And why (is it so)?’            [RP-19/7/04-91]
The tests applied to all the other verbs in this kind of interrogative construction, can-
not be applied in the case of the empty verb root. The subject clitic gets attached to
the verb and not to the preceding form. This is supported by the fact that the question
may sometimes occur without the particle ko ‘why?’ (cf. 9.4.5 below). In many ex-
amples the more specific questions for a cause are also formed with this general
predicate, followed by a simple declarative clause, as in (75) and (76).

In (75) and (76) the empty verb base is marked by a different subject, namely ri-
‘3SGf’. The form ko S=kiewon? ‘why?’ is used as a general form (77) as well, and
can then be specified thereafter – (78) and (79). It is not clear what semantic differ-
ence the additional copula suffix -wo makes in this question type. I think that (77), in
which the empty verb root is used, illustrates the character of the general questions,
which do not necessarily always refer back to an already mentioned predicate. Ob-
serve the variations of the same interrogative clause used by the speaker in (77)–(79):
(77)     ko nokiewon to neč ahinev?
         ko     no=kie-wo-no        to    neč      ahi-nev

In (77) there is only one empty verb that occurs in the nominalized form. The transla-
tion into English is difficult. In (78) and (79) the interrogative clause is specified for
the action referred to by the verb nowečkokow ‘they are fighting each other’. This
verb is not nominalized, and it has to be understood as the complement to the empty
verb. In (79) the explicit subject to neč ahinev ‘those children’ is not repeated.
    How questions with a non-verbal predicate are really formed is not clear, as there
are only these two examples in the data:
221
    In Spanish it is translated as ‘Qué tienen los niños?’, but also the shorter form koro kien? is translated as
‘Qué tiene (él)?’.

           ‘Why don’t you, papa, want me to accompany you?’        [LO-29/8/03-26]
In one example (80) the construction remains the same with the non-verbal predicate,
and the subject -pi ‘2SG’ is encliticized to the interrogative particle. This is not sur-
prising, as non-verbal predicates actually mark subjects by enclitics, which occur in
the slot where objects, when marked, occur on the verb (cf. 5). Therefore the subject
should be expected to behave like the object does (in Figure 9.3 we see that transitive
verbs mark the object on the particle). Nevertheless the example has to be handled
with care. The other example (81) shows a different possibility represented in the
data: the perfective/reflexive suffix -po ‘PRFLX’ occurs in the person slot on the parti-
cle ko ‘why?’, whereas the non-verbal privative predicate moki’inan ‘not want’ does
not have any person marking, but a following personal pronoun refers to the subject
explicitly.
    It is also possible to construct a ko-question with a kind of relative clause (cf.
10.2). In the following example (82) an adverb follows the particle, and the adverb is
specified by a relative clause introduced by the indefinite pronoun to ka. The verb in
the relative clause is semantically the main verb of the sentence; syntactically it is the

Incidently, the clarification question ‘What?’ can be formed by the single particle ka,
which is formally identical to the indefinite pronoun, but also strikingly similar to the
particle ko or attributive ko-222. Still, as the relations to those morphemes remains
unclear, I will simply gloss this as an interjection.
(83)       ka?

Finally, it is also possible to construct a negative ko-question, even though this only
occurs in a restricted context. The negative particle follows the marked particle and
precedes the verb, just like adverbs or preverbal particles. But this question can only
be interpreted as a kind of suggestion of the kind ‘why don’t you …?’, as demon-
strated in (84):222
      In the neighbouring Moxo languages the attributive prefix has the form ka-.

The form of the particle amo ‘why not?’ possibly has the same source as the privative
prefix mo-. If we compare the pair of attributive ko- and privative mo- in declarative
clauses, with the two forms ko ‘why?’ and amo ‘why not?’ in questions, this seems
very plausible. The negative interrogative particle resembles the Quechua ama pro-
hibitive (Muysken, p.c.; cf. Wise 1986:616)223. The particle amo ‘why not?’ can also
be used in indirect questions. The form may vary between the fully pronounced form
amo, the reduced form am (final vowel elision), and čam, which is in fact the com-
pound of the lexemes ač ‘and’ and amo ‘why not?’. The latter form is only used by
one of my consultants.
    Concerning argument marking, we can observe that there is no clitic attached to
the particle amo ‘why not?’ at all. All arguments remain marked on the verb, as rep-
resented in Figure 9.4. The verb may be intransitive, transitive or ditransitive.

Figure 9.4: Person cross-reference with the interrogative particle amo ‘why not?’Phonologically, however, the particle and the predicate are part of the same phono-
logical phrase. The insertion of adverbs and especially the observed assimilation
demonstrate that there is actually no attachment of the personal clitics to the particle
(compare to the results of these observations with the particle ko ‘why’).

In example (85) the personal clitic pi- ‘2SG’ that refers to the subject shows vowel
assimilation, and is therefore analyzed as being attached to the verb and not to the
particle, in which case no vowel assimilation would be expected (cf. (69)). In (86) the
adverb imir ‘very’ is inserted in between the particle and the verb, which has a procli-
ticized subject. Both verbs in (85) and (86) are intransitive. Transitive verbs have the223
   Even though Wise (1986:616) argues that the negative particle ama in Amuesha, that is more widely
used than only in interrogative constructions, is a Quechua loan, it does not seem probable in the end, that
the privative or negative prefix *ma- was originally a Quechua loan. An argument against this is the fact
that also Arawak languages that have supposedly not been in contact with Quechua in the highlands at all,
as e.g. North Arawak languages like Resígaro (Allin 1975), also include this morpheme. For the whole
Arawak language family we can reconstruct a Proto-Arawak opposition of attributive *ka- and negative
(privative) *ma-, as concluded in Matteson (1972) and Aikhenvald (1999).

same kind of marking of the arguments as in a declarative clause, plus the additional
nominalizing suffix in the last position. It is interesting that this suffix occurs after
the person clitic, but this can also be observed in relative clauses (cf. 10.2). The fol-
lowing two examples show how an object argument is mentioned explicitly (87), and
then pronominalized by the enclitic (88):
(87)   am piwonon ti pihin?
       am       pi=wono-no        ti       pi=hin
       why.not 2SG=send-NOM1 DEM1f         2SG=daughter

There are no interrogative clauses with amo ‘why not?’ in the data in which the
predicate is non-verbal. In relation to the privative prefix it is striking that the inter-
rogative particle amo does not have any effects on the argument marking structure of
the predicate, whereas the privative prefix always derives non-verbal predicates,
which have a different kind of argument marking than verbs.","[372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377]"

9.6. Special strategies in conversation and narration
One of the main strategies in conversation and narration is the repetition of the main
predicate. This repetition is found in answers to questions or requests, but also for
showing approval of a statement, and finally, to indicate the actual repetition or dura-
tion of events. In example (175) one type of repetition is demonstrated:
(175) (ač rikew-hi riti’:) “nka pehmoekpap?”
      ač     ri=ke-wo=hi           riti’ nka pi=ehmoek-pa-po
      and 3SGF=EV-COP=QUOT 3SGf NEG 2SG=wash.clothes-GO-PRFLX
   Q: ‘And she said to her: “Don’t you go wash clothes?” ’
      “heni, nehmoekpap, nen.”
      heni ni=ehmoek-pa-po                  ni=en
      yes    1SG=wash.clothes-GO-PRFLX 1SG=mother
   A: ‘ “Yes, I go wash clothes, mother.” ’                         [GP-N1/II-8/9]
As (175) shows, the predicate in the question pehmoekpap ‘you go wash clothes’ is
repeated in the answer with the different subject marking: nehmoekpap ‘I go wash
clothes’. In a real conversation we can sometimes observe how one speaker says
something and the second speaker picks up the last part or the last main predicate,
repeats it and perhaps adds something. Then the first speaker again picks up the last
bit and uses it as the beginning of the new oration. Example (176) is taken from a
dialogue between Dolores Chimanacay (DC) and Asunta Durán (AD), which I over-
heard as I started recording.

In narration, tension can rise and an action can be focussed on by repetition. This
generally coincides with the repetitive or durative character of the action. In (177)
one such typical example is shown, in which the verb noyonop ‘they walked’ is re-
peated three times.
(177) nokačow to powor ahinev, kač noyonop, noyonop, noyonop.

         ‘The poor children left, the went to walk and walked and walked.’ [GP-N7-8]9.7. Clausal enclitics
There are three pragmatic clausal enclitics: quotative -hi, emphatic or exclama-
tive -niš ‘well’, and the approval marker -enš. The three clitics may also all attach to
one word or attach in various positions. If there are more than one on a word, they
can only occur in one possible order, as represented in Figure 9.7:
         word =niš         =hi      =enš
Figure 9.7: The order of clausal clitics on one element:Now each of the clausal clitics is described in some more detail.
The emphatic or exclamative enclitic -niš ‘well’ may also be considered a phrasal
clitic. It can attach to any kind of element in the clause that is emphasized, and gen-
erally attaches to the predicate. Semantically it is a clausal clitic in my analysis, be-
cause it affects the whole clause. There are many examples with -niš in this chapter:
(82), (109), (115), (121), and (122). All of these examples are interrogative clauses,
in which this enclitic is mainly found. It is generally translated as ‘well’ or ‘then’.
However, sometimes it can also have a different modal interpretation, as in (178),
repeated from (122) above:
(178) vikičin-niš viti’ ne’?
      vi=kiči-no=niš             viti’                ne’
      1PL=say.do-NOM1=EXCLA 1PL                       here
      ‘What shall we do here then?’                                             [JP-N9-22]
CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES                                    377
The same question without the enclitic – vikičin viti’ ne’? – would be translated as
‘what are we doing here?’. The attachment of the exclamative clitic leads to a slightly
different interpretation, namely a question that is asking for advice what to do.
The enclitic can also be used in exclamative (179) or affirmative (180) clauses.

      pikor=niš          teč       šiye’

       know, and then my throat went to ache, yes.’               [GP-9/4/06-20]
In (180) there are two clausal enclitics. For the approval marker -enš take note of
(187) and (188).
    It seems to be the case that the clitic -niš is composed of the two elements -n
and -iš, because the latter may occur in isolation. Unfortunately I could only get ex-
amples in elicitation concerning the difference between -niš and -iš. Dolores Chi-
manacay argued that the clitics make the difference illustrated in the different an-
swers below:
(181) pamoni te!                     – ver-niš.                – veroeš.
      pi=amo=ni        te               ver=niš                   ver=iš
      2SG=bring-1SG DEM2m               PERF=EXCLA                PERF=EXCLA
      ‘Bring me this!’                  ‘Yes (I already did).’    ‘Yes (I will do it).’
                                                                        [DC-9/3/06-19]
In spite of the different meanings and the different forms I tentatively analyze them
as identical clitics, because the reduced form exclusively occurs in this kind of an-
swer to the adverb ver ‘already’.
    Quotative -hi is predominantly a second position clitic, but the element it attaches
to has to have some verbal quality, which is true for all verbal and non-verbal predi-
cates, but also for demonstrative pronouns (184) and adverbs or preverbal particles
(183). It is generally found in narration when quoting someone. There it attaches ex-
tremely frequently to verbs of utterance. In Spanish the speakers translate it as dis-
qué, which has been derived from dice que ‘(he) said that’. Some typical examples
from narratives are found in (182) through (184):
378                                         BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA

The quotative clitic -hi generally occurs in the clauses that are statements of the nar-
rator about the characters in the story. I further suppose it was also used in direct
speech as a kind of evidential, even though there is only one example (188) in my
data. In this example Guillermina (GP) is repeating me (SD), but marks the cited
clause with the quotative enclitic, because she does not agree with me. The topic was
the capacity of speaking Baure.
(185) nka nitirow noka!
      nka ni=tiri-wo          noka
      NEG    1SG=know-COP NEG
   SD: ‘I don’t know anything!’

The use of a different aspect (-wapa ‘COS’) in Guillermina’s clause is possibly a cor-
rection.
    The quotative clitic abounds in narratives, and can also occur more than once in a
clause. I found an example with four occurrences in a single clause (186):
(186) boen, teč-hi rišir-hi mončiw-hi hir-hi.
      boen teč=hi              ri=šir=hi      monči-wo=hi hir=hi

      ‘Well, she had a child who was a man.’                     [SIL-N3-7]
The clitic -enš occurs only clause-finally, and is used to seek approval by the listener.
It can be compared to English ‘you know’. It is also an emphatic element. It is possi-
CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES                                  379
ble that it is somehow related to the formally very similar clitic -niš. There are two
examples in (187) and (188), and another one was already given in (180):
(187) hepčin teč rowepiačikoe’-enš.

The combination of at least two clausal clitics on one word is frequent. I do not have
any example in the data, in which all three of them occur on one word, but it would
theoretically seem possible. Examples of two combinations are given in (189) and
(190):

10. Clause combining and clause embedding
This chapter will describe different types of clause combining and embedding in
Baure. Clause combining includes coordination and subordination, which can be rep-
resented by various kinds of constructions. A subordinate clause is not necessarily an
embedded clause. Matthiessen & Thompson (1988) argue that clause combining has
to be differentiated from clause embedding and that a clause generally called “subor-
dinate” with a connector (conjunction) is not a constituent of the main clause (thus
not embedded), but a clause related to the main clause in a certain relation (Matthies-
sen & Thompson 1988:278, 279).
    The chapter is organized in three main parts, differentiated according to how
clause types can formally be distinguished in the Baure language, so that similar con-
structions are found in the same section. The three main parts comprise a description
of clause combining with a connector (10.1), relative clauses and other marked sub-
ordinate clauses (10.2), and multiple predicate constructions, including predicate and
clause chains, complementation, and serial verbs (10.3).
    Before each clause combination type is discuss in detail, some general remarks
about the predicate in subordination have to be made. The only marked predicates in
subordination are relative clauses and to some extent complement clauses. The predi-
cates can be marked by nominalization; the relative clause in Baure is in fact a nomi-
nalized predicate and therefore an argument of the clause in headless relative clauses,
and a nominal modifier in relative clauses with a head. In complementation there is
one smaller group of verbs that take a verb complement without nominalization (sub-
ordinate marking). In this case the complement verb shows subject cross-reference by
a proclitic, and the verb base is complete, but in general there is no or only reduced
aspectual marking by base suffixes (compare Figure 6.1). Nonetheless, the subordi-
nated complement verb still looks exactly like a main verb. This is important to men-
tion, as in other languages we may find an infinitive or participle form or a somehow
reduced unmarked form in complementation. There is an open group of verbs that
take complements with marking. The complements in those cases are transformed
into a nominal argument by action nominalization with the morpheme -čo.
    In predicate chaining or juxtaposition and in serial verb constructions each verb is
marked as if it were a main verb standing on its own. Serial verb constructions may
consist of three verbs in a chain, each of them equally marked by a subject proclitic
and possible aspectual morphemes. The difference between a predicate chain (10.3.1)
and a serial verb construction (10.3.3) is the fact that in predicate chaining231 differ-
ent events can be identified for each of the predicate, whereas in serial verb construc-
tions there is only one event described by a complex predicate that consists of more
than one verb. The latter can be regarded as a kind of verbal apposition, generally
with a more general verb coming first, followed by one or two more specific verbs,
meant to specify the event (such as go-walk-walk barefoot). Nominal appositions are
used frequently instead of relative clauses. Serial verbs seem to have the same func-
tion in relation to the verb or predicate.","[396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403]"
"2.1.2. Vowel sequences, diphthongs and triphthongs
There are a number of vowel sequences in the language that can be interpreted as
diphthongs or triphthongs. However, I would like to distinguish three different types
of vowel sequences, which may all be phonetic diphthongs: type (a) consists of two
vowels that are juxtaposed, but belong to different morphemes, type (b) consists of a
sound that resembles a closing diphthong, but that has to be interpreted as vowel +56
   Payne discovered that “only three [Arawak] languages […] report a contrast between /u/ and /o/”
(1991:476), also Ramirez states the same for the Arawak language Bare (2001:477).
57
   This is true with the exceptions: [-s] ‘grandmother’, [] ‘capivara’, and [krem] ‘singing bird sp.’,
whereas the first one is bound and does never occur word finally.
58
   For more details on the phonology of Spanish loans cf. 2.1.4.
CHAPTER 2 - PHONOLOGY                                                                                37
glide; and type (c) is the actual phonological diphthong: “two [different] vowels
forming a single entity” (Clark & Yallop 1995:72) or “a vowel which has consider-
able change of quality during pronunciation, therefore appears to have two parts”
(Handtke 2000). Triphthongs are rare but will be mentioned below. It is possible that
a vowel sequence occurs as type (a), (b) and (c), but not all sounds can be part of type
(c).
Type (a): Vowel sequences at morpheme boundaries
Vowel sequences of type (a) can be found everywhere in the language with restricted
possibilities of combinations. The important feature here is that the vowels are not
separated by a glottal stop. In the majority of vowel sequences that are juxtaposed the
glottal stop is not inserted (cf. also 2.1.3 on the characteristics of the glottal stop).
Two adjacent vowels can then be pronounced as one syllable. The hyphens in the
phonemic representation indicate the morpheme boundaries.
(14)       [rikonmbawrj] /ri-kono-mpe-a-wo-ri/ ‘she is writing (a letter) to her’
(15)       [riavinn]       /ri-avinon/           ‘her husband’
(16)       [vikjpiaw]      /vi-kojepi-a-w/        ‘we have a conversation’
(17)       [rirkown]     /ri-eroko-wo-n/       ‘she passes (is better)’
The combinations that can be found are /ea/, /ia/, /ie/, and /oe/59. Two vowels that
cannot be found adjacent are the following: /ae/, /ao/, /oa/, /eo/, /io/, /ei/. Some of
these sequences do occur in Spanish loanwords.
Type (b): Sequences of vowel and glide
There are sequences that sound like closing diphthongs, but they can all be analyzed
as the combination of a vowel and a glide. A reason for distinguishing them from the
other vowel sequences is the fact that they all result from metathesis (cf. 2.5.4) and
vowel elision (cf. 2.2.1). That means phonetically the sequences /aij/, /eij/, and /oij/
result from the combination of the vowels /a/, /e/, and /o/ with the sequence /ji/,
which is then inverted in contact metathesis into [ij]. The sequences /aw/, /ew/, /ow/,
and /iow/ all result from the combination of the vowels /a/, /e/, /o/, and /i/ with the
sequence /wo/, of which the final vowel is deleted word finally. In combination with
the closed front vowel /i/ we can also observe the inversion of the sequence into /ow/.
In combination with a vowel word finally the semiconsonant /w/ shows more vowel
properties than those of a consonant. The sequence /ji/ can refer to two morphemes:
the personal clitic for 2PL or the locative suffix on predicates. The sequence /wo/ can
refer to the omnipresent copula morpheme. Therefore we can find many of these
combinations in the data, but there are also combinations of the vowel sequences that
do not go back to these morphemes. Here are only a few examples, in which we are
not dealing with morpheme boundaries, but still the above described process creates
diphthong-like sequences:
(18)       [niaij]                   /niaij/             ‘my brother (of a man)’
(19)       [nipoij] 60                /nipoij/             ‘my foot’
59
     For this combination cf. 2.5.2 on vowel assimilation. The rule o + i < oe is described there.

(20)    [kahaw]                   /kahaw/                  ‘deer sp.’
(21)    [iowknan]                /iowkonan/               ‘various’
(22)    [owk]                  /eowkoe/                ‘tree’
As examples (21) and (22) show, when the syllable /wo/ is added to the more closed
vowels /i/ and /e/, the result is even a triphthong-like sequence. In addition, as it has
been mentioned above (2.1.1), the stressed vowel /e/ can occur with an off-glide [ej],
which, when pronounced very tense, resembles the type (b) vowel sequence /eij/.
There may also be more complex vowel sequences, as e.g. a diphthong and a glide, as
in the sequence /oew/.
Type (c): Diphthongs and triphthongs
There are three phonological diphthongs: /oe/, /ia/, and /ie/. The vowel sequence /oe/
is by far the most frequent, but that is mainly because it can also result from various
morpheme combinations, which are assigned to type (a) vowel sequences. In the ba-
sic lexicon diphthongs are in general rather rare. The very frequent vowel sequence
/oe/ can be reduced to a less rounded [œ] or an unrounded [] or [] in either faster
speech or frequently used words. This process is described in 2.2.3. In the following
there are some examples with minimal pairs of the diphthongs and vowel sequences
separated by the glottal stop:
(23)    [po]                /poe/                 ‘axe, , aguaí (fruit sp.)’
        [nip]             /nipoe/              ‘my head’
(24)    [nia]                /nia/                 ‘rainbow’
        [nia]              /nia/               ‘my body’
(25)    [nktikpa]        /nokotiekpa/         ‘they go to kick’
        [ti]               /tie/                ‘small (e.g. manioc)’
The diphthong in (25) has secondary stress and may therefore be pronounced more
tense with a certain palatalization of the plosive [tjie]. In general, the diphthong oc-
curs most frequently word final, and there very often with the rhotic /rie/. Here are
more examples of the diphthong /ie/ with different preceding consonants:
(26)    [epri]            /eporie/             ‘foot of a tree’
        [tpi]            /etpie/             ‘island’
        [emki]            /emokie/             ‘top of a tree’
        [pnierj]            /ponieri/             ‘partridge’
The triphthongs-like sounds generally also go back to type (a) or (b) sequences in
combination with a diphthong.
→ type (a) and (c)
(27) [tmmoeawk]                   /tomomoeawok/                ‘tree with flower’60
   It becomes obvious that we are dealing with metathesis, because the sequence /ij/ occurs in inversion as
/ji/ when other morphemes follow, e.g. /nipoij/ → /nipojinev/ (‘my foot’ → ‘my feet’), cf. 2.5.4.
CHAPTER 2 - PHONOLOGY                                                                                         39
The word [tmmoe] ‘flower’ ends in the diphthong [oe]. In the compound (27)
the linking vowel [a] is added after the diphthong and creates a sound that seems to
be a triphthong.
    Metathesis (cf. 2.5.4) also interacts with vowel sequences. Some syllables with a
glide that are inversed by metathesis can create triphthongs, as e.g. the following:
(28)     [nikpoeij]             /nikpoeij/           ‘I (don’t) eat any more’
(29)     [tiow]                 /tiow/               ‘this is (emphasized)’
Example (29) is generally disyllabic, but in fluent and fast speech it may be pro-
nounced as a triphthong. The only triphthong of type (c) that could be encountered in
the lexicon is represented here:
(30)     [moei]                 /moei/               ‘pineapple’2.1.3. Consonants
There are 13 consonant phonemes and one critical case: the glottal stop. The main
distinctions in the consonant inventory are place of articulation, sonorant versus
obstruent, nasality, but not voice, palatalization or aspiration. This does not mean that
voice, palatalization and aspiration do not occur in Baure, but they are not phonemic,
for which reason these qualities are discussed under (morpho-)phonological changes
below (2.5.1, 2.2.2, and 2.2.1 respectively). Table 2 shows the consonant inventory
by phonemes, but not the allophones that occur with them.

Table 2.2: The consonant inventory of Baure62There are three plosives: /p/, /t/, and /k/. All plosives (and affricate) are voiceless, but
can have voiced allophones with a preceding nasal, described in detail below (see
section 2.5.1). The glottal stop shows some properties of a phoneme, but seems to be
phonetically connected to stressed word final vowels in general (cf. 2.4.3). The four
fricatives are /v/, /s/, //, and /h/. There is only one affricate /t/. The two nasals are

   Altamirano [1979 (1891):50) noted wisely about the Moxo language that three letters were missing: “D,
L, y F [,…] éstas mismas faltan en la lengua Morocosi [Moxo], sin D, sin Dios; sin L, sin Ley; sin F, sin
Fé” (D, L, and F, these are missing in the Moxo language: without D = without God; without L = without
Law; without F = without Faith; [Translation S.D.]).

"4.1.1. Noun roots
The majority of noun roots are disyllabic or trisyllabic, but there are also a few
monosyllabic roots. There are some nominal roots with more than three syllables, of
which the majority include reduplicated syllables. Phonologically many disyllabic

nouns appear as monosyllabic with a heavy syllable, because with the frequent final
vowel elision one syllable is dropped (cf. 2.4). The noun roots do not include the pos-
sessor clitics, which are obligatorily attached to bound nouns, for which reason these
clitics are excluded from the phonological analysis of the requirements of a noun
root. The phonetic structure of a noun root is represented in Figure 4.1:
                      (-)(C)VCV[CV]
Figure 4.1: Basic phonetic structure of a noun rootOnly very few noun roots are monosyllabic (cf. Table 4.3). However, classifiers are
nominal roots as well, and grammatical classifiers are mainly monosyllabic. But
these particular roots are generally neither used as free forms, nor only with a posses-
sor proclitic. They have to be bound to another nominal root (noun, adjective, nu-
meral or verb). A few monosyllabic and disyllabic noun roots may function as classi-
fiers as well (cf. 4.7). Among the few monosyllabic noun roots there are less bound
forms (obligatorily possessed) than free forms. There is at least one bound noun root
that only consists of one vowel, -a’ ‘body’. Free forms have the structure CV – as na’
‘egg’ – or CVV with a complex vowel, a diphthong – as nia’ ‘rainbow’ or poe’ ‘axe’.
Table 2.11 already represented all of the forms with monosyllabic nominal roots that
could be detected. Table 4.1 shows examples of bound and free disyllabic noun roots:

Table 4.1: Disyllabic noun rootsAccording to the phonotactics described in 2.4, we also have to include roots with the
disyllabic ones, which phonologically seem to have only one syllable. This is e.g. the
case with noun roots such as -ah ‘soup’ or hir ‘man’, for which there must be an un-
derlying final vowel o presupposed (cf. 2.2.1). This means that the underlying forms
are *-aho and *hiro, which are disyllabic. The orthography, however, represents the
pronunciation rather than the underlying system.
    Those roots terminating in the vowel i undergo word final devoicing of the vowel
and the palatalization of the preceding consonant (cf. 2.2.2), so that phonologically
they also come out as if they consisted of only one syllable. This accounts for noun
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE                                                      113
roots such as aki [akj] ‘lagoon’, ani [a] ‘sky’, -čipi [tipj] and many others. How-
ever, the deletion of the final vowel o and the devoicing of the final vowel i are pho-
nological processes which do not occur when other morphemes are added after the
root. Therefore the noun root -tip ‘nail, claw’ becomes -tipo-nev ‘nails, claws’ when
the plural morpheme is attached, or the noun root -čipi ‘roof’ becomes -čipi-ye
['tpi-j] when the locative morpheme is attached (for more details cf. Chapter 2).
    Noun roots with three syllables are also very frequent. There may be slightly
more free trisyllabic roots than bound ones. Table 4.2 lists trisyllabic noun roots:

Table 4.2: Trisyllabic noun rootsOnly very few non-bound roots have more than three syllables, many of which con-
sist of reduplicated syllables, such as e.g. sirisiri ‘falcon’ or sorisori ‘owl’ (cf. 8.4.3).
Even though I found some bound roots with more than three syllables, I suppose
these have been derived or they are loan words. In Table 4.3 some noun roots are
summed up that possibly have more than three basic syllables as an unanalyzable
form. Nevertheless, some of the listed examples have to be regarded as doubtful
cases, as is discussed below.

‘leg’104 has only been used in a narrative by one speaker and it also seems to be a
loanword, even though not from Spanish. Sometimes derived lexemes cannot be ana-
lyzed so easily. The noun root -ipohis ‘hair ribbon’ may also have been derived. Pos-
sible sources are the noun poeh (underlyingly *pohi) ‘duck’, and -ihos ‘tail’, but to
me it is not analyzable any longer at this point. The noun root -čovekos ‘knee’ may
have been derived from the adjectival root čo- ‘big’ and an unknown lexeme or a
complex of a noun root and a classifier. The noun roots -pekasoki ‘hollow of the
knee’ and -powespa’ ‘shoulder blade’. The root -pekasoki ‘hollow of the knee’ has
probably been derived, and the sources may have been -čovekos ‘knee’ and -soki
‘seed’. The noun root -čovekos ‘knee’ includes the root *-veko- which may be related
to the morpheme *-pek(a)-. The noun root is thus probably a compound with the head
noun root -soki ‘seed’, which is metaphorically transferred to the ‘inside’. The noun
root -powespa’ ‘shoulder blade’ is definitely related to -powos ‘shoulder, and the
head noun root -pa may go back to the homophonous classifier for flat and oval ob-
jects105. However, the sources are unknown and therefore I include these examples
with the list in Table 4.3.
    There are certain phonological restrictions for all noun roots. Due to the fact that
reduplication is a method for forming lexemes but also a grammatical strategy for
intensity marking or iterativity on verbs and a few other word classes, it can be ex-
pected that “accidental” or meaningless reduplication is avoided. This accounts espe-
cially for the beginning of noun roots. Therefore those phonemes or syllables are
avoided in the front position of noun roots, which can be expected to be identical to
morphemes that may precede the root. This is the reason why there are no or rarely
any underived (bound) noun roots beginning with the following sequences, which are
identical to the personal proclitics for marking possession: e- ‘UNSP’, ni- ‘1SG’, pi-
‘2SG’, ri- ‘3SGf’, ro- ‘3SGm’, vi- ‘1PL’, yi- ‘2PL’, and no- ‘3PL’ (cf. Table 8.9 in
8.3.1). Even the single phoneme r- is very rare as the beginning of at least bound
noun roots, as this would also lead to the reduplication of this phoneme when 3SGf ri-
or 3SGm ro- are attached.
    On the other hand, the fact that a noun root begins with a phoneme that can be
found in the mentioned proclitics, may also have the effect of assimilation, as has
been described in 2.5. Therefore the noun root -noni ‘voice’ is assimilated into noni
(not *ninoni) ‘my voice’ when the 1SG proclitic ni- is attached; or the noun root -pen
‘tongue’ into pen (not *pipen) ‘your (SG) tongue’ when marked for a 2SG possessor
(pi-) (cf. also 4.3 on possession).
    There are many roots that have lexicalized the attributive prefix ko- in their form,
considered to be part of the root. Examples are kahaw ‘deer’, kopir ‘armadillo’, ka’an
‘animal’, and kahap ‘manioc’.
    Even though unanalyzable, there are certain reappearing sequences at the end of
noun roots that may formerly have been root suffixes that are now fossilized in the
roots. The sequences that occur most often are: -ri, -ro, -ki, -ko, -ni, -no, -so, -šo, -po,104
    There are other words in Baure for the whole and the specific parts of the leg – -pes/-sopes? ‘leg’, -
čones ‘upper leg’, -pakori/-sopakori ‘shin’–, so that another lexeme -čawriwe’ seems expendable.
105
    Of course, the more the language is studied, the easier the analysis, especially of long term established
compounds or derivations, which may show strong phonological deviation from the original sources.

-e’. The sequences do not derive from classifiers106, at least not the ones used in
Baure today. These sequences that are not part of all, but only a part of the noun
roots, have been called “core formatives” in the tagmemic grammar by Baptista &
Wallin (1967:72). Because of a missing regularity or system behind the appearance
of these sequences, at least according to my present knowledge, they have to be
treated as part of the noun roots.","[133, 134, 135, 136, 137]"
"10.1. Clause combining with a connector
Clauses may be combined by means of a connective element, a particle that links
these clauses and defines the relation between them, called connector in this grammar
(cf. Chapter 3.8.6). But even though these connectors parallel English clause linkage
with a conjunction, it has to be pointed out that most clause combinations use clause
juxtaposition or predicate chaining and complementation. When looking through a
Baure narrative not many connectors can be found, the ones present are divided by
fine-grained distinctions. There is probably a lot of speaker variation, and it may be
related to style and knowledge of the language how many connectors are used in a
narrative. I compared the narratives I collected with similar ones collected in the
1960s by Baptista & Wallin (unpublished), and I noticed very few connectors, though
more of them in the more recent data. Some of the connectors that the speakers use
today, have evolved from verbs and might even be relatively new in development.
Some others are used in different ways in the older data, and there are additional con-
structions that the speakers do not use any more today (this is e.g. the case with tiwe’
‘but’).
    The connectors are distinguished into coordinating and subordinating and these
categories are distinguished further (as summed up in Table 10.1). As mentioned
above, there are no other signs of how the subordinate clause is dependent on the
main clause than the meaning of the events (cf. Givón 1990:826). The major con-
stituent order can be symbolized as [C1] [co C2]234, where “co” stands for connector,
C1 for main clause and C2 for linked clause; and it is shown in a representative exam-
ple in (1):
           C1                           [connector C2]

The only distinction that can be made between the clauses is that C2 is introduced by
a connector. The connector is indeed always clause initial. With subordinating con-234

Table 10.1: Connectors used for clause combining and their categorizationThe connectors included in Table 10.1 are highly grammaticalized particles, only
used for the function of linking clauses or phrases. There are additional adverbs that
can introduce clauses and also define a specific relation, as e.g. ikaroek ‘therefore’.
These adverbs may be called discourse connectors rather than clause connectors, as
they only refer to the whole previous discourse (Crevels, p.c.). It is also assumed here
that these adverbs are more lexical than the grammatical particles discussed in this
section. Nevertheless, it is very often the case that the connector is used as a dis-
course connector as well. Therefore many clauses may begin with a connector with-
out being incomplete, which certainly only accounts for clauses in a context and not
in isolation.
CHAPTER 10 - CLAUSE COMBINING AND CLAUSE EMBEDDING                                    385
One of the connectors – apo ‘or’, ‘if, that’– has two different meanings in different
constructions (compare 10.1.4 to 10.1.9). Almost all of the coordinating connectors
can also be used for the coordination of NPs or other phrases in the clause.
    It seems striking that almost all of the coordinating connectors go back to one
basic root morpheme a, which is also the form of one of the connectors a ‘and’. But
not only the conjunction connectors ač ‘and’ and aw ‘and not’ have been derived
from this root, but apparently also the connectors for disjunction and adversative co-
ordination: apo ‘or’, apon ‘or not, nor’ and avi/api ‘but’. The specific derivations will
be shown below. It is possible that the root a is related to the linking suffix -a, but
this cannot be proved. The root -a- can also be used as a relatively empty verb root,
meaning ‘to be with, have, carry, put, bring’, as pointed out in 6.2.1.
In the following sections each of the connectors is illustrated.","[405, 406, 407]"
"6.5.3. Mood: The irrealis suffix -ša ‘IRR’
The only real mood suffix is -ša, which refers to irreal events, mainly in presupposi-
tions and considerations of the future. It can be contrasted with -pa ‘GO’, which refers
to a future event the speaker is already planning to do. The suffix -ša is also impor-
tant for constructing hypothetical conditional clauses (cf. 10.3.2). The irrealis marker
can not only be attached to verbs (206), but also to non-verbal predicates (207):
(206) enevere nka rosoweša ač niyonpa riwer-ye.

7. Preverbal particles
There are no auxiliaries in Baure. Instead there are free verbal particles in addition to
the affixes directly attached to verbs (Chapter 6) for TMA marking. These particles
generally precede the fully marked verb or the non-verbal predicate, and they can
express a wide range of different TMA meanings. The particles themselves are com-
pletely unmarked.
    Example (1) shows the general pattern: the certainty particle moeh ‘CERT’ directly
precedes the verb ronopi ‘he tells you’:
(1)    (S)            PART       V      (O)
       to ses       moeh        ronopi.

In addition, deviating from the general pattern indicated in (1), there is one postverbal
particle for potential, discussed in 7.11.
    Before turning to the specific descriptions of the particles, there are some general
statements concerning this kind of marking on verbs. Table 7.1 lists the particles
mentioned in this chapter. The class of items is virtually closed, but the particles
themselves can be ranged into more and less recently grammaticalized elements (Ta-
ble 7.1).
    Some of the preverbal particles are used as adverbs as well, as e.g. the perfect
particle ver ‘already’ or certainty moeh ‘certainly’. However, other adverbs only
modify verbs lexically, but are not used as TMA markers. The adverbs used as verbal
particles are much more grammaticalized than other adverbs and therefore have ex-
tended meanings. The particle slot directly before the verb is also an adverb position,
but adverbs have the option of occurring more freely in a number of other positions
in the clause as well (cf. Payne 1997:69; and 8.1). What is defined as a verbal particle
here has to occur in a fixed position, directly preceding the verb. Negative particles
also precede the verb, but they are excluded here and described in 9.2.
    Some other verbal particles have only recently been derived from verbs, which is
obvious as they are still identical to verb bases. As already mentioned, verbal parti-
cles take over the job generally expected of auxiliary verbs. Givón (1984) argues that
auxiliaries often “form a distinct lexical class” that have been grammaticalized from
verbs. They “often retain formal properties of lexical verbs”, such as e.g. English
‘have’, ‘be’, ‘will’, ‘can’, ‘may’, ‘must’. (Givón 1984:84).
    What Givón argues for auxiliaries is also partly true for the Baure verbal parti-
cles: They form a distinct class, and some of them at least, have been derived from
verbs. Auxiliaries, though, show more verbal characteristics than the particles do.
There is no marking on the particle. Examples for particles that have been derived
from verbs are intentional kač < -kač- ‘go’ and repetitive avik < -avik- ‘return’. The
explanation of how verbs got into that position is simple: Baure has many serial verb
constructions (cf. 10.3.7), in which usually the first verb is more general in meaning.
Most of these first constituents in a verb chain are indeed verbs of motion and they
generally modify the mode or aspect of the following verb. Within the process of
270                                                  BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
grammaticalization the more abstract verb has lost its person marking and all verbal
morphemes (which were repeated on the following verb anyhow), and what remained
was the bare verb base.
    The serial verb constructions that formed the origin for some of the verbal parti-
cles are still being used as well. They differ from particle constructions in e.g. the
repeated person marking, as in (2), compared to the particle construction in (3).

        vi=kač vi=i-siap=ri

        ‘We will put her in (the oven).’                                                [GP-N7-98]

Note, however, that the marked verb -kač- is restricted to the sense of real motion
towards an action, and the unmarked verbal particle has a wider use for any kind of
intention or future event.
    Verb serialization is only one possible source for the grammaticalization of the
preverbal position into a TMA marking slot. It may have started off with a few parti-
cles, like e.g. cohortative ši or negative nka, which already occurred in the slot before
the verb. It was then further extended to some adverbs, which already frequently oc-
curred in the slot as well. Finally, some verb bases grammaticalized into verbal parti-
cles, some of which evolved even further into adverbs (as e.g. avik ‘again’). This
grammaticalization process is schematized in Figure 7.1 below.
    In narration, all the particles, except for imperative particles (only used in direct
speech) can be marked by the quotative clausal enclitic -hi, which is a second posi-
tion clitic, but generally attaches to verbal elements. Examples are (4) and (5):
(4)     ver-hi rišim tič183 kiher.
        ver=hi         ri=šim      tič                 kiher

(5)     kač-hi royapa teč riavinon.
        kač=hi       ro=ya-pa                  teč          ri=avinon
        GO=QUOT      3SGm=cry-GO               DEM2m        3SGf=husband
        ‘Her husband went to cry.’                                                   [GP-N1/II-59]
It is also possible to use more than one particle to mark a verb. The possible combi-
nations are summed up in Table 7.2 below, cf. also section 7.12.
     An interesting aspect of the verbal particles is the interaction between verbal par-
ticles to the left and verbal suffixes to the right of the verb base. It can be the case
183
    In this story the moon is a woman and therefore referred to by feminine agreement in cross-reference
marking (ri-) and the demonstrative (tič).

that the particles replace verbal suffixes. In general, we find both, a preverbal particle
kač ‘GO’ and a verbal suffix -pa ‘GO’ with the same meaning around one verb base
(8). But we can find alternative constructions of the same verb only marked by the
suffix, and no particle (6), or the main verb without the suffix and a particle preced-
ing the verb (7). This is exemplified in the following three examples:
(6)     ač rom rošim teč yor ronikpa čokolat.

There is generally no meaning-difference notable.
    Possibly these particles are still fairly new on the path of grammaticalization, the
suffixing system being the older and the particle construction being the more recent
developed grammatical device for TMA marking. Not every verbal suffix has a parti-
cle equivalent, but it can be argued that the speakers of Baure have started to mark
verbs analytically instead of the complex suffixing system. New meanings have
arisen, expressed by particles, some meanings are repeated in particles and some may
get lost184.
    The more or less grammaticalized constructions and kinds of TMA marking are
related to another in Figure 7.1. Some of the devices to the right served as the source
of preverbal particles, but the continuum does not mean that one item has to run
through all stages represented here.

"8.4.2. Discourse particles
There are also a number of other particles in Baure used in discourse. Some of these
discourse particles are analyzable, but semantically not transparent, conventionalized
expressions. Discourse particles can be used for greetings, such as nte’ ‘hello’ or
hare’ ‘good day’. The word hare’ also means ‘clear, light’ with reference to the
weather. The already mentioned particle hãti’ ‘what about you?’ can be analyzed as a
blend of an interjection and a reduced pronoun. The word for ‘thank you’, asoropaiy,

8.4.3. Onomatopoeic words
There are quite a number of onomatopoeic words or roots, most of which refer to
animal names and animal noises. The majority are nouns. In addition there are some
verb roots. In other word classes we do not come across onomatopoeia.
    Among the animal names, there are mainly bird names that consist of syllables
that might resemble the sounds these birds make, generally reduplicated, such as
sirisiri ‘falcon’, sorisori ‘owl’, poepoe’ ‘trogón (bird sp.)’, tatasoe’ ‘woodpecker’,
and tarar ‘raven’. In some words sounds occur that do not fit within the Baure pho-
nological system. On the one hand, some words may have been borrowed from an-
other indigenous language, such as mehelele ‘cuyabo (nightjar, bird sp.)’, but in other
cases these sounds are simply unique to animal names. The most striking phonologi-209
    This phrase has been widely borrowed into indigenous languages all over Latin America, as e.g. in
other languages of Bolivian Amazonia: Itonama (solopay, Crevels, p.c.), and Cavineña (yusurupai,
Guillaume 2004:88), or other languages, such as Ecuadorian Imbabura Quichua (diusulupagui, Rendón,
p.c.).
328                                                       BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
cal deviation is a stressed final rhotic, represented as “rr” in the orthography. This
final rhotic is pronounced as a voiced alveolar vibrant. It occurs in the names takirr
‘locust’, koterr ‘toracoe’ (bird sp.)’, čomorr ‘cockroach’, and others. It is possible
that the final sound is related to the sound produced by the animal or has some other
meaning210.
    Among the onomatopoeic verb roots there are a few animal sounds, such
as -wawak- ‘bark’ and -torotorok- ‘gackle’, both of which include the reduplication
of a syllable. The only animal sound represented by a simple verb root is -ya-, which
can either mean ‘cry’ or the sound of the cat ‘miaow’ and the cow ‘moo’. Other
onomatopoeic verb roots refer to specific physical movement or an exhausting state
that results from physical movement, some weather verbs and others. Generally, all
of these verb roots involve reduplication, which is iconic itself by referring to an it-
erative event, and the same roots are not used in a simple form. Table 8.15 presents a
short list of examples of these verbs:

 -haphapsoe-                   drizzle (before rain)
 -čoročorosoe-                 drizzle (after rain)
Table 8.15: Onomatopoeic verbsIn Table 8.15 there is one verb root that includes an incorporated noun, -hehepen-
‘pant with tongue hanging out’. An example of this verb is taken from a narrative:

      The rhotic may also be representative for a dislike, at least in the case of the cockroach.

Another set of examples that should be compared are the kinds of shivering or trem-
bling and the kinds of rolling. Here we have two related verb bases in each case,
which show a vowel alternation resulting in a meaning difference. The
verbs -yivirivirik- ‘tremble of pain’ and -šipiripirik- ‘roll (and fall down)’ are
changed into -yoporoporok- ‘shiver of cold’ and -čoporiporik- ‘roll (in the mud)’. In
both derivations the change is from the closed front unrounded vowel i to the open-
mid back o.
9. Clause types and utterance structures
In this chapter different clause types are introduced, while the following Chapter 10
focuses on clause combinations. As a basis for the analysis of clause types and argu-
ment structure I considered different text types: dialogues, narratives and personal
stories, and not predominantly the examples from elicitation. In the beginning of the
chapter a simple clause is defined and the possible constituent orders of the core ar-
guments are demonstrated. Then further optional clause constituents are mentioned
and their typical places of occurrences are identified. Negative clauses are illustrated
in 9.2. Specific types of predicate clauses were already demonstrated in Chapter 5 on
predicate types. One specific clause type that is described in this section is the im-
perative clause (9.3). The various kinds of interrogative constructions constitute an-
other type of non-declarative clause (9.4). The answers to questions may be more
reduced than simple declarative clauses, and they are described in 9.5. Finally,
clauses in narratives and conversation show some specific characteristics with the
attachment of clausal enclitics and the repetition of predicates or parts of the utterace.
The most important strategies are shown in 9.6 and 9.7.","[348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353]"
"117
      This needs some understanding of predicate clauses, which are analyzed in Chapter 5.

4.5. Diminutive and augmentative
The categories of diminutive and augmentative are nominal categories, but the same
morphemes may also be attached to other parts of speech for politeness, endearment
or downplaying (cf. 9.3.3). Diminutive and augmentative are most frequently marked
on adjectives, which are nominal as well (cf. 4.9.4). Diminutive is -či ‘DIM’ and aug-
mentative -ča ‘AUG’. Both morphemes may be related to each other and probably
derive from the bound adjective root čo- ‘big’. The vowel may be onomatopoeic with
the closed vowel -i referring to smallness and the open vowel -a to bigness. Figure
4.2 above demonstrates in which slot diminutive and augmentative marking is in-
serted: It follows the nominal base and may be followed by the plural morpheme. It is
theoretically possible that also the locative suffix follows the diminutive or augmen-
tative morpheme, but there are no examples in my data. In (47) and (48) are examples
with diminutive marking:

The diminutive or augmentative is generally only marked once in an NP, just like
plural marking. Therefore it is possible that -či ‘DIM’ and -ča ‘AUG’ are also a kind of
phrasal clitics. The morphemes have also been lexicalized in some nouns, as e.g.
monči ‘child (lit. little young one)’ and inowokči ‘paddle (lit. little water place)’.
Both diminutive and augmentative morphemes can also be reduplicated118, as in (51):
(51)    čačača aw ti ti’ači.
        č-a-ča-ča                   aw         ti        ti-a-či

    In Latin-American Spanish the diminutive is used frequently and may also be reduplicated. This may
have influenced Baure.

4.6. Compounding
Compounding is a fairly important process in Baure. Many compounds do not consist
of two noun stems, but of a noun stem and a classifier. Some of the classifiers have
been derived from reduced noun stems (cf. 4.7), which could mean that compounding
was one of the ways in which classifiers evolved in the first place (cf. Gerdts
1998:97). Compounds are constructed like possessed nouns with the order possessor-
possessed by juxtaposing two noun stems, of which mainly the second one is the
more generic head and the first noun serves as its modifier. Figure 4.6 illustrates the
order of noun stems in a compound and describes the parts semantically:
           N1        -          N2
           Modifier             Head
           possessor            possessed
           specific             generic
           whole                part
Figure 4.6: Compounds119Compounds are formed productively, in particular where N2 refers to body parts,
plant parts and other parts of wholes. As in possessed nouns the head of a compound
(N2) is generally a bound form. Examples for compounds with body parts of animals
are (52) through (55):
(52)       tiporekpo’e
           tiporek-po’e              →       tiporek      +        -po’e
           chicken-head                      chicken               head
           ‘chicken-head’

           wak-pen                   →       wak          +        -pen
           cow-tongue                        cow                   tongue
           ‘cow-tongue’
(55)       tiyowkopasiri
           tiyowoko-pasiri      →      tiyowok            +        -pasiri
           spoon-nose                  spoon                       nose
           ‘brown heron (bird sp.)120’
Examples (52) through (54) refer to body parts of animals, while (55), even though
the head noun -pasiri ‘nose, beak’ is also a body part, is the name of a bird as a
whole. Certainly, the name describes the typical characteristic of this bird’s beak and
was then metonymically transferred to the whole animal. Compounds may consist of119
      There are two systematic (productive) inverse compounds in (106) and (107) below.

      This bird has a beak in the shape of a spoon.

Spanish loans as well, as already evident from (54) wak ‘cow’, and as (56) with two
Spanish loans being composed:

       rice-bread                 rice              bread
       ‘rice bread’
In the examples above N1 is always a free noun and N2 is a bound noun in all except
for example (56). The noun stems in (52) through (56) have not been reduced. It is
very common, though, that the head noun occurs in a phonetically reduced form. This
is the case with bound and free head nouns. This reduced form may be identical to a
classifier. Examples of compounds with a reduced N2 are in (57) through (59):
(57)   simorieš
       simori-eš           →      simori     +      neš
       pig-meat                   pig               meat
       ‘pork’
(58)   himah
       him-ah              →      him        +      -hah
       fish-soup                  fish              soup
       ‘fish soup’
(59)   nešiti
       neš-iti             →      neš        +      -iti
       meat-dish                  meat              dish
       ‘meat dish’
Note that neš ‘meat’ is reduced as N2 in (57), but not as N1 in (59).
    It is also possible to create compounds with three components, in which case the
compound has probably gone through two processes of compounding. The head noun
is then N3. The compound somorišah ‘pork soup’ in (60) has been derived from the
compound simoreš ‘pork’ in (57). In the compound in (60) N2 is phonetically even
more reduced than in (57). Here are examples of compounds with three noun stems:
(60)   simorišah
       simori-š-ah         →      simori     +      neš         +    -hah
       pig-meat-soup              pig               meat             soup
       ‘pork soup’
(61)   kahavešah
       kahaw-eš-ah         →      kahaw      +      neš         +    -hah
       deer-meat-soup             deer              meat             soup
       ‘venison soup’
(62)   šoroesoki
       šora-i-soki          →     šora-      +      -i          +    -soki

When regarding plants and plant parts, we also find bound N1 stems. The noun
šorawok ‘cusi palm’ is composed of two parts, *šor ‘cusi (palm sp.)’ and -wok ‘tree’,
but the first part only exists in compounds. Right-bound nominal stems are generally
only found among adjectives (cf. 4.9.1). The two morphemes are composed with the
help of the linker -a, which I turn back to below. In Table 4.12 I give two paradigms
of plant parts, both based on a right-bound noun stem referring to kinds of palm trees.","[154, 155, 156, 157, 158]"
"6.5.1. Valency-increasing affixes
The two valency-increasing base affixes are the causative prefix -i(mo) ‘CAUS’ and
the benefactive suffix -ino ‘BEN’. Above it was described how some other root and
stem affixes also affect valency. However, these two base affixes increase the
valency and have obligatory object marking, which is not observed with the applica-
tive suffix, for example. The causative and benefactive generally do not change the
meaning of the verb to a great extent, at least relatively less than root and stem af-

fixes. The two affixes are at the border between the derivational and inflectional do-
main. The causative prefix directly precedes the verb base, and the benefactive di-
rectly succeeds it. Other base affixes occur external to these, thus before the causa-
tive, and after the benefactive. Their positions are illustrated in Figure 6.3:
                                                                   personal

Figure 6.3: Valency-increasing base affixes
6.5.1.1. The causative prefix i(mo)- ‘CAUS’
The causative form adds an object to the verb phrase: the so-called causee. The sub-
ject proclitic takes the role of the causer; the causee or performer of the action is the
object enclitic. A transitive verb may thus be turned into a ditransitive verb. It should
be possible to add another object of the action, which follows the personal object
enclitic (even though there are no examples in the data). With ditransitive verbs the
order of the objects is recipient–patient (cf. 5.1.3). In causative verbs this holds for
causee–patient as well, as in (117):
(117) pimoekomorikonir
      pi=imo-ikomoriko=ni=ro
      2SG=CAUS-kill=1SG=3SGm
      ‘You make me kill it/him.’
The causative in Baure is marked by one of two prefixes: i-/imo-. The choice is pho-
nologically driven: monosyllabic or disyllabic verbal stems tend to get the shorter
form of the causative prefix, i.e. i-, whereas the majority of verbs (many of them de-
rived) get the causative prefix imo-. The forms derived by i- are generally more lexi-
calized, as in (118), and object marking is not obligatory.

      ‘I feed her (lit. I make her eat).’                               [GP-11/8/04-79]
It is sometimes difficult to identify the short causative prefix i-, since it is phonologi-
cally assimilated by the personal proclitics, which tend to end in the vowel -i (cf. Ta-
ble 8.9), except for two of them, as in (119) and (120):

      ‘When I finish sweeping, I put it in (back into the room).’ [RP/EC-17/7/04-87]
Other verbs to which this causative prefix is attached are -nik- ‘eat’, -šim- ‘ar-
rive’, -pin- ‘flee (run)’, -hirop- ‘dance’, -yon- ‘walk’. I will assume that the short
causative prefix has been lexicalized in the following verbs: -išoera-
‘cook’, -ikomorik- ‘kill’, -išom- ‘stand up’, and -iyin- ‘teach’. The causative prefix
imo- is used with most verbs, as e.g. in (121) and (122):
(121) pimokotorekowoni.
      pi=imo-kotoreko-wo=ni
      2SG=CAUS-work-COP=1SG
      ‘You make me work.’                                                [RP-7/7/04-37]
(122) pimokokavi.
      pi=imo-koka-wo=pi
      2SG=CAUS-laugh-COP=2SG
      ‘You make me laugh.’                                               [RP-7/7/04-10]
In some examples this causative form may also have been lexicalized, as
in -imohinok- (CAUS-see) ‘show’, -imohirik- (CAUS-sit) ‘seat’, or simply in combina-
tion with other grammatical morphemes in example (123):
(123) nimowanapi
      ni=imo-wana=pi
      1SG=CAUS-DEP=2SG
      ‘I leave you.’                                                      [RP/EC-D3-8]
The causative can be extended to mean to help or assist someone do something, as
was also argued for one causative form in the Arawak language Nomatsiguenga
(Wise 1986: 593), cf. (124):
(124) roempihinokiawor.
       ro=imo-pihino-ki-a-wo=ro
       3SGm=CAUS-cross-CLF:diameter-LK-COP=3SGm
       ‘He is helping him cross the river (lit. He makes him cross the river).’
                                                                         [RP-7/7/04-125]
The distinction between two different kinds of causative affixes, as in Nomat-
siguenga (Wise 1986: 593) is not observed in Baure, even though a kind of co-agent
causative can be derived with the applicative suffix (cf. 6.4.3). It is also possible that
the two causative affixes i- and imo- originally were semantically or functionally
different morphemes. But now they should be analyzed as allomorphs and in com-
plementary distribution.
    There is also an analytic construction with the verb -won- ‘send’ which can re-
place the morphological causative, compare (125) and (126):
252                                        BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA

The benefactive suffix -ino ‘BEN’ also changes the role of the cross-referenced object,
the person for the benefit of whom the action is performed, or the recipient of the
product of the action (beneficiary). All transitive verbs can thus be changed into
ditransitive verbs that show double object marking, just like the ditransitive verb -pa-
‘give’. Examples of benefactive verbs are (127) and (128):
(127) nki’inow nakpinopi.
      ni=ki’ino-wo       ni=ak-pi-ino=pi
      1SG=want-COP 1SG=sing-words-BEN=2SG
      ‘I want to sing (a verse) for you.’                                 [JP-9/7/04-2]

      ‘You weed for me.’                                              [GP-11/7/04-37]
Double object marking can be observed in (129):
(129) niwo’ikinovir.
      ni=wo’ik-ino-wo=pi=ro
      1SG=butcher-BEN-COP=2SG=3SGm
      ‘I butcher it for you.’                                    [GP/LO-21/07/04-96]
After verb bases ending in the syllable -no, the benefactive suffix is reduced to -no
(instead of assimilation as -eno after -o), as in (130):
(130) roemonononi nisopot.
      ro=imono-no=ni         ni=sopot
      3SGm=buy-BEN=1SG       1SG=shoe
      ‘He bought shoes for me (lit. He bought me my shoes).’          [GP-11/7/04-25]
The same morpheme may also have a malefactive meaning, as in (131) and (132),
depending on the verb’s semantics:
(131) novepinoni.
      no=vepi-ino=ni
      3PL=tell.lies-BEN=1SG
      ‘They are lying to me.’                                            [RP-7/7/04-1]
CHAPTER 6 - VERBAL MORPHOLOGY                                                          253
(132) nka viyorinokokow
      nka vi=yori-ino-koko-wo
      NEG    1PL=be.angry-BEN-RCPC-COP
      ‘We don’t argue (lit. We aren’t angry with each other).’          [MD-2/4/06-16]
The benefactive is thus like an applicative suffix, which in some cases simply derives
a transitive verb from an intransitive one, and it competes with the more general ap-
plicative suffix -čo. In (132) the valency has been reduced again by the reciprocal
suffix -koko ‘each other’.
    The speakers frequently use the possessive pronouns as an analytic form to re-
place the morphological benefactive, as in (133):
(133) nayawor vitir viti’ – nayinovi – nayinovir.
      ni=aya-wo=ro             vitir viti’ ni=ay-ino=vi

       ‘I desire it for us – I desire for us – I desire it for us.’    [GP-21/7/04-24]6.5.2. Aspectual affixes
There are at least eight base suffixes (nine including the temporary suffix), most of
them related to the aspect or direction of the situation; only -ša ‘IRR’ is a mood suffix.
All of these base suffixes are attached externally to the verb base and the valency-
increasing affixes (cf. Figure 6.3). In Table 6.23 all possible combinations are indi-
cated. Some morphemes are mutually exclusive, as e.g. -wana ‘DEP’ and -wapa
‘COS’. The base suffixes occur in the order presented in the table. However, as men-
tioned above, the base suffixes can also be attached to the root or stem. In such a case
the order of the morphemes is related to the level where they attach. In the example
of the verb -nowana- ‘say goodbye’ with the lexicalized departitive suffix -wana (cf.
(2)) the morpheme -wana may precede the directional suffix -pik ‘COME’. This would
contradict the order indicated in Table 6.23, if -wana ‘DEP’ were to be analyzed as a
base suffix.

Table 6.23: Possible combinations of base suffixes180The suffixes furthest away from the base are the most abstract in meaning. The cop-
ula suffix -wo and the perfective/reflexive suffix -po are the most abstract and can
have various effects, depending on the co-occurring suffixes. They can be attached to
nearly any suffix. The scope of the morphemes is always from right to the left. The
base suffixes presented in Table 6.23 are described in detail below.","[271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276]"

Table 8.2: Temporal and aspectual adverbs – simple formsAs described in Chapter 7, the adverbs ver ‘already’ and rom ‘immediately’ are also
used as aspect particles198. Even though listed as monomorphemic here, it is possible
that the adverbs with three or four syllables are also more complex than I have ana-
lyzed them. The adverb neriki ‘now’ could e.g. be related to the place adverb ne’
‘here’. This is hypothetical and presupposes a relation between place and time con-
cepts. The deictic adverbs enevere ‘next day’ and nokope ‘day before’ are always
used according to the day of an utterance. In direct speech the terms mean ‘yesterday’
and ‘tomorrow’, whereas in narratives they simply refer to one day before the utter-
ance and one day after. The same holds for nečon ‘last night’ in reference to the
night.
    The vast majority of time adverbs show some kind of internal morphological
structure and may have been derived. The analyses are suggested in the rightmost

the glosses are always the same: ver ‘PERF (perfective)’ and rom ‘IMM (immediately)’ (cf. 7).

Table 8.3: Temporal and aspectual adverbs – morphologically complex formsThe more complex time adverbs can be divided into those derived from the adjective
root čo- ‘big’, or the adjective po- ‘other’, and others which may include the absolut-
ive morpheme -ko, nominalizing -no, copula -wo, or classifying morphemes. There
are some words that refer to the day, the night and the times of the day, which are
probably both nouns and adverbs. I could also analyze them as nouns being used as
time adverbs, but I am really not sure which category they better fit in. All the words
used for the times of the day are represented in Figure 8.1:
sunrise                                     midday                          sunset     night

Figure 8.1: to roseskoner (N)‘the day’ in BaureThe sunrise and the sunset are described by verbs – rohare’ ‘it is becoming day’ and

‘3SGm’). The ‘day’ roseskoner contains the same proclitic ro- ‘3SGm’, but in its form
it seems to be a nominalized verb199. The word yotoer may also include a person en-
clitic -ro. However, yotoe(r) ‘night’ and roseskoner ‘day’ are most likely to be nouns
used in adverbial phrases. They occur more frequently with a determiner, while ahi-
kowon ‘in the early morning’, ča’ape ‘late morning’, reitonoe’ ‘midday’, koeskoe’
‘early afternoon’, and kope’ap ‘late afternoon’ are hardly ever used with a deter-
miner.
     Time adverbs are mainly found in clause-initial position, but may also occur at
the end of a clause. They generally do not get inserted within the predicate phrase or
between predicate and arguments. There are two examples in (8) and (9):
(8)     nečon nka ntirowapa soni kaiyran teč nian.
        nečon      nka nitiro-wapa soni              kaiyran teč        ni=an

        no=woyiko-wo=ni te             ni=per  tiporek                              nečon
        3PL=steal-COP=1SG DEM1m 1SG=dom.animal chicken                              last.night
        ‘They stole me my chicken last night.’                                     [JP-20/8/03-47]
Some of the time adverbs can be derived as an emphasized form with emphatic mark-
ing, such as e.g. nerikikoe’ ‘right now’ (< neriki ‘now’), or with double emphatic
marking, such as romoekoe’ ‘very soon, right thereafter’ (< rom ‘soon’ via romoe’
‘very soon’). Besides the emphasis there is no meaning change in these derived
forms. Only in the case of the already mentioned nanan ‘later’ (< nan ‘there’) a new
lexeme has been created through reduplication.
    Another interesting meaning change is the past reference when the copula suf-
fix -wo is attached: pahare’ generally means ‘day after tomorrow’, but in the form
paharew (pahare + -wo) it is translated as ‘day before yesterday: The same holds for
other adverbs derived from the adjectival root po- ‘other’, like e.g. pomorekoe’ ‘next
year’ and pomorekoew ‘last year’ (not included in Table 8.3). One could probably
hypothesize that if po’itinew means ‘two nights ago’ with the copula word finally and
past reference, then there is probably also a possible lexeme *po’itin(e) ‘other night
(night after next night)’.","[325, 326, 327, 328]"

    This is difficult to determine today, where Baures mainly use the loan word tih ‘aunt/uncle’ < Sp.
tio/tia. Baptista & Wallin (T-558) argue that the word -ak ‘aunt’ e.g. is only used by women.

Figure 4.4: The possessability distinction in Baure nounsObligatorily possessed means the noun is a bound form and has to be marked by a
possessor proclitic. These nouns are mainly body parts and kinship terms, but also a
few other nouns that refer to objects which are generally possessed or parts of
wholes. They are generally possessed, but an unpossessed form may be derived by
attaching the absolute suffix -ko ‘ABS’. When the possessor is unknown, the unspeci-
fied possessor prefix e- ‘UNSP’ is attached in the possessor slot to derive a free form.
    Optionally possessed nouns are generally used as free nouns, but they may be
possessed. The possessed form is either simply marked by a possessor proclitic or
derived with the possessive suffix -no ‘POSS’.
    Non-possessable nouns are mainly astronomical bodies, but also all adjectives. In
example (8) I illustrate the paradigm of the obligatorily possessed noun -kis ‘eye(s)’
with possessor proclitics:
(8)     -kis
        ‘eye(s)’
        nikis                                                            vikis
        ni=kis                                                           vi=kis
        1SG=eye                                                          1PL=eye
        ‘my eye(s)’                                                      ‘our eye(s)’
        pikis                                                            yikis
        pi=kis                                                           yi=kis
        2SG=eye                                                          2PL=eye
        ‘your (SG) eye(s)’                                               ‘your (PL) eye(s)’
        rokis                           rikis                            nokis
        ro=kis                          ri=kis                           no=kis

        ‘his eye(s)’                    ‘her eye(s)’                     ‘their eye(s)’
Body parts always belong to a possessor, known or not. When the speaker wants to
refer to a body part without knowing or mentioning the possessor, then the noun is
120                                                BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
marked with the prefix e- ‘UNSP’. It is analyzed as a prefix here, but it is attached in
the same slot as personal proclitics (cf. 8.3.2). In (9) this kind of derivation is exem-
plified:
        possessed          unspecified                  free form

The following example shows a case of a noun with an unspecified possessor:

Table 4.4: Unspecified possessor noun derivationThe ‘tooth’ eser in (10) is still conceptually possessed, but the speaker does not know
which animal the tooth originates from. In Table 4.4 more examples are given of free
forms derived with e- ‘UNSP’.The last four examples in Table 4.4 show that the deri-
vation may also lead to new lexemes that slightly deviate from the basic form in
meaning. While -čipi means ‘back’ of an animal or a person, the derived form ečipi’
refers to the roof of a house.
    Plant parts and animal body parts are also treated as parts that obligatorily origi-
nate from something. However, many basic forms are more bound than human body
parts: they cannot even be directly possessed, but can only occur in compounds.
Nonetheless, a free form with e- may be derived. Examples are esoki ‘seed’, eponoe’
‘leaf’, ečowe’ ‘palm leaf’ and ewokoe’ ‘tree’. These lexemes have been derived from
the bound forms -soki ‘seed’, -pon ‘leaf’, -čow ‘palm leaf’, and -wok ‘tree’ respec-
tively. In almost all examples the emphatic suffix -i’ (assimilated as -(o)e’) is added
in the free form. None of these bound forms can be possessed directly. Thus *rosoki
‘his/its seed’ e.g. is ungrammatical. The possessed form has to be further derived
from the free form in these cases, generally with addition of the possessive suffix -no.
The possessed form of -soki ‘seed’ is therefore roeskin ‘its seed’ (< esoki + -no).

Table 4.5: Further examples of unspecified possessor derivationMore details on bound noun stems and their relation to classifiers are discussed in
4.7.
    The other strategy for deriving free forms from obligatorily possessed nouns is
the attachment of the absolute suffix -ko ‘ABS’110. This morpheme is multifunctional
and is found in verbs as well. A derived unpossessed form has been called “absolute”
by Payne (1991:397). The number of nouns derived with -ko is restricted. When body
parts are derived with this morpheme, there is usually a significant meaning change.
Some obligatorily possessed nouns can thus be derived as free forms in two ways.
The already mentioned noun -ser ‘tooth’ can either be derived as eser ‘tooth’ (10) or
alternatively, as serok ‘tooth’. This absolute form does not necessarily refer to a body
part any longer, but possibly something that resembles it. Nouns that undergo this
kind of derivation are generally the other obligatorily possessed nouns, apart from
body parts. One example is (11):
           possessed           unpossessed                  unspecified           free form
(11)       ntoer             → toerok      but:             *etoer,               *toer
           ni=toer             toero-ko                      e-toer
           1SG=field           field-ABS                     UNSP=field
           ‘my field’          ‘a field’
Some more forms derived by -ko ‘ABS’ are presented in Table 4.6:

      This should not be mistaken for an absolutive case, which does not exist in Baure.

Table 4.6: Absolute noun derivationThe class of nouns with suppletive unpossessed forms is very small. One example
that can also be found in other Arawak languages is the word for ‘house’, which
is -wer in the possessed form in Baure, but the unpossessed form is pari. This means
that *ropari (3SGm=house) ‘his house’ is ungrammatical. None of the two forms
undergoes any kind of derivation. Therefore *werik ‘house’ is ungrammatical, and so
is *ewer ‘house of someone’ or *roparin (3SGm=house-POSS) ‘his house’. This is
again illustrated in (12):
         possessed                unpossessed           unspecified free form

The suppletive forms of the kinship terms in Table 4.7 differ for their use. Generally,
kinship terms are not derived as unpossessed forms. In these examples the unpos-
sessed forms are vocative forms and are only used when addressing or greeting
someone. This does not hold for -šečenev ‘children, sons’ and ahinev ‘children’.
    The majority of nouns belong to the class of optionally possessed nouns. Some of
these nouns are used as free forms, but can have a possessor marker procliticized as
well without any formal change. This is demonstrated in example (13):
        unpossessed              possessed
(13)    hačkis      →            nihačkis
        hačkis                   ni=hačkis
        glasses                  1SG=glasses
        ‘a pair of glasses’      ‘my glasses’
Along with this zero derivation (or ambiguous forms in respect to possession) there is
a suffix that derives possessed forms. This morpheme is -no ‘POSS’, which is ho-
mophonous with the nominalizer -no ‘NOM1’, a multifunctional morpheme (cf. 5.2.4,
9.4, 10.2.1), and may also be considered to be identical with it. Examples of this
derivation are -romon ‘chief’ (< rom) or -yakison ‘fire wood’ (< yakis) in (14). In this
derivational process some nouns show a vowel change in the first syllable of the
noun base. In the examples I found this change was an opening of the rounded vowel
o into the unrounded vowel a, as e.g. nihapin ‘my jar’ (< hopi) in (15).
        unpossessed              possessed
(14)    yakis     →              niyakison      but:     *niyakis

Table 4.8: Derived possessed formsNouns that cannot be possessed include astronomical bodies, animals (except for -in
‘louse’), and adjectives. Thus the Baure speakers need a trick in order to refer to their

pets or domesticated animals as their possessions, like kove ‘dog’ e.g. The noun that
refers to the specific animal is preceded by a more general inalienably possessed
noun -per ‘domesticated animal’. Observe this solution of possessor marking in (16)
and (17):
        unpossessable             possessed
(16)    kove’         →           niper kove’
        kove’                     ni=per                   kove’

        ‘dog’                     ‘my dog’

        ‘pig’                     ‘my pig’
The noun -per ‘domesticated animal’ functions as a nominal modifier in (16) and
(17), a function that a few nouns can have (compare the use of hir ‘man (male)’ in
example (7) above).
    Some other non-possessable nouns are preceded by the possessive pronoun in-
stead of personal proclitic, identical to the way Spanish loans are marked for posses-
sion (cf. 4.3.2).","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146]"
"9.3.1. The morphological imperative and the prohibitive/preventative
The morphological imperative and its negative form215 are constructed with the final
morpheme -no, which is probably the nominalizing suffix ‘NOM1’, also used in rela-
tive clauses (10.2.1) and interrogative clauses (9.4). Only the different morphological
behaviour in imperative contexts leads to doubts about the identity of this morpheme:
In contrast to both other contexts, in imperative constructions the enclitics for 3rd
person replace the morpheme, but -no is still added after object enclitics that refer to
speech act participants, such as e.g. -ni ‘1SG’ or -pi ‘2SG’. This behaviour is some-
thing in between the use of the morpheme -no in interrogative constructions, where it
is added after all personal enclitics, and that in relative clauses, where -no is replaced
by any personal enclitic. The morpheme -no in interrogative and imperative clauses
can also sound like -ni with a palatalized nasal. This phonological effect, however,
does not seem to be related to a different basic form but the palatalization seems to be
a means of emphasis on this kind of non-declarative clauses. It is difficult to decide if
the three homophonic morphemes -no are indeed three different morphemes or rather
three different uses of one and the same element. There is only little evidence, as e.g.
the possible application of a determiner before the forms, but it remains an interesting
issue for further investigation. I decided, for the time being, to lump them all into the
same category. Therefore, the morpheme -no will always be glossed as ‘NOM1’ in
imperative and prohibitive clauses, as in interrogative and relative clauses. Differ-
ences in morphological behaviour may be due to different syntactic attachment.
    The imperative form generally occurs with the simplest form of the verb, namely
the verb base and the imperative morpheme following directly. Imperatives are not
restricted to the second person singular or plural, but may exceptionally also be used
with 3rd persons (43). The affirmative imperative verb includes subject marking (per-
sonal proclitics pi- ‘2SG’, yi- ‘2PL’, and ro- ‘3SGm’ and ri- ‘3SGf’). The negative
construction of the imperative, called prohibitive or preventative, is different in one
important respect: there is no person marking on the predicate. The negative form is
simply constructed with the negative particle nka ‘NEG’. The verbs used in imperative
constructions in affirmative clauses are all non-stative verbs (at least in the data), but
in negative constructions any kind of predicate can be part of an imperative clause.
Before treating the negative forms, there are three examples of the imperative: one
with an intransitive verb (42) and one with a transitive verb (43), one more with an
additional personal cross-referencing enclitic on a transitive verb (44):
(42)        enevere pavikopon!
            enevere      pi=aviko-po-no
            tomorrow     2SG=return-PRFLX-NOM1
            ‘Return tomorrow!’                                                             [RP-20/7/04-143]215
      I will point at the difference of the imperative to the negative (prohibitive/preventative) below.

In example (42) the intransitive verb -avik- ‘return’ is used in an imperative form.
Intransitive verbs frequently contain the morpheme -po ‘PRFLX’, which does not
seem to be obligatory in all cases, but rather stresses the intransitivity. In general,
intransitive verbs are not used in the imperative form very frequently, but more often
as an unmarked predicate. This will be referred to in 9.3.2 below. The imperative
verb in (43) is marked and the object in ‘water’ is an explicit NP and thus not marked
on the predicate. The same transitive verb -am- ‘bring’ is also shown in (44), where
the personal enclitic -ri ‘3SGf’ replaced the imperative morpheme -no ‘NOM1’.
    Negative imperatives can be analyzed as prohibitives or preventatives. The con-
struction consists of the negative particle and the unmarked imperative form. Subject
marking is absent, but, this construction is understood as having a 2SG subject. The
same replacement rules of the personal enclitics and the imperative morpheme hold
for the negative construction. In (45) through (47) there are negative examples of the
imperative:
(45)     nka yan!
         nka ya-no
         NEG    cry-NOM1
      D: ‘Don’t cry!’                                                 [AD/DC-D2-39]

         ‘Don’t fill it (completely)!’                                 [DC-15/4/06-8]
In (45) the intransitive verb -ya- ‘cry’ occurs in the negative imperative form. In (46)
the transitive verb -ikomorik- ‘kill’ occurs in the imperative form with an explicit
object NP ti tiporekči ‘this little chicken’. In the imperative form of the transitive
verb -ačok- ‘fill’(47) the imperative morpheme -no is replaced by enclitic -ro
‘3SGm’.

Non-verbal predicates are stative and can also be found in negative imperatives, as
e.g. in (48), repeated from (40), in which the non-verbal predicate is mosompoek-
‘stubborn (not listen)’, a form derived by the privative prefix216:
(48)       nka mosompoekon!
           nka mo-sompoeko-no
           NEG    PRIV-listen-NOM1
           ‘Don’t be stubborn!’                                            [DC-16/4/06-45]
It is also possible in principle to include a personal pronoun in the construction for
more emphasis. The pronoun always refers to the subject addressed and it either has
to follow the imperative predicate or occur in a left-dislocation. The personal pro-
noun is found more often in unmarked requests, though. In (49) there is an example
of the personal pronoun piti’ ‘2SG’ dislocated and an imperative verb, which in addi-
tion includes the morpheme -pa ‘GO’. This morpheme is also used without the im-
perative morpheme and will be discussed in 9.3.3.
(49)       piti’, pinikpan!
           piti’ pi=nik-pa-no
           2SG 2SG=eat-GO-NOM1
           ‘You, go and eat!’                                               [RP-4/8/03-70]
Imperative verbs usually do not include any additional verbal morphemes, but some
valency changing affixes are allowed, such as imo- ‘CAUS’, -ina ‘BEN’, -čo ‘APPL’,
and ‘-po ‘PRFLX’ (as in (42)). In (50) there is a benefactive verb in the imperative
form with changing object marking:
(50)       paminonin! paminoner, paminoneri!
           pi=am-ino=no-ni          pi=am-ino-no=ro
           2SG=take-BEN-NOM1=1SG 2SG=take-BEN-NOM1=3SGm
       pi=am-ino-no=ri
       2SG=take-BEN-NOM1-3SGf
       ‘Bring me … (something), bring him, bring her (something)!’
                                                                       [RP-21/7/04-21/22]
As (50) shows, in benefactive verbs the imperative morpheme comes before the per-
sonal enclitic that refers to the beneficiary of the action. In the first verb the enclitic -
ni ‘1SG’ is inverted. This specific effect is not observed with any of the other mor-
phemes. In the case of the causative form with an imperative, the form obeys the
same replacement rules as those described above. One example is given in (51):
(51)       pimoherikiri!
           pi=imo-herik=ri
           2SG=CAUS-sit=3SGf
           ‘Make her sit/ Seat her!’                                       [GP-9/4/06-111]216
      Privative forms are always non-verbal predciates (cf. Chapter 5?).

In (51), however, we may also deal with an unmarked imperative. The morphological
imperative form is regarded as a strong demand and therefore not used so frequently
just for making a request.","[365, 366, 367, 368]"
"1.2.4. Spanish influence on Baure
Spanish influence on Baure went through three phases: I Initial contact, with a num-
ber of specific lexical items; II social dominance, with further lexical influence; III
widespread bilingualism, with more fundamental influence and interference.
    In general it can be stated that words that were borrowed in the very first phase of
Spanish contact, when new products were introduced, have been phonologically and
morphologically completely integrated into the language system. Many of these
words are not perceived as borrowings from Spanish any more, such as the word aso-
ropaiy ‘thank you’ derived from Spanish Dios se lo pague ‘God will pay you for it’.
In the whole religious terminology we are confronted with either Spanish borrowings
or calques, like for example the word for ‘God’ vekiyiri, which could be translated as
‘the one to whom we speak’ (speak-LOC-NOM3), though it is not clear if this word did

     The phrase Dios se lo pague has been borrowed into many indigenous languages in Latin America.

not already exist before christianization. The Virgin Mary has been borrowed as ti
ven ‘the virgin’ from Spanish la Virgen. There are many Baure surnames, such as
Pinaicobo, Churipuy, Imanareico, Cajareico, Ohopi, Buripoco, and Emorisebocono.
However, all personal names are of Spanish origin, but have been adjusted to Baure
phonology, like e.g. Horian for Spanish Julián. Names of newly introduced animals
have also been borrowed, though not all of them. These borrowings are frequently
not perceived as such (as in the case of ‘sheep’: ves from Spanish oveja). More ex-
amples are listed in Table 1.2. Animal names that have not been borrowed, at least
not from Spanish, are tiporek for ‘chicken’, simori for ‘pig’, and poeh for ‘duck’.
    The phonological explanations for the sound changes in the borrowing process
need a description of Baure phonology in general, which Chapter 2 contains. For
some borrowings in Table 1.2 there are more detailed remarks about the usage of the
loanword, as for instance the loan for ‘table’, which is mes, from Spanish mesa.
There does not seem to exist any alternative Baure word. It must have been borrowed
a long time ago, which can be concluded from the fact that most of the time the word
mes ‘table’ is referred back to by the newly created classifier -mes-. Classifiers occur
in numerals and adjectives and can be incorporated into verbs. Older speakers use the
classifier -amok- ‘flat & raised’ (cf. Appendix A.1). Thus they rather say pamokoš
‘one table’. But most of the younger speakers use the loanword as a classifier and say
pomesis ‘one table’ instead (with phonological change word finally). That mes is
used as a classifier, may also have to do with the fact that it is morphologically sim-
ple and disyllabic. A further example is the word haw ‘soap’ borrowed from Spanish
jabón. This loan can be used as a verbal root or incorporated into a verb, as e.g. in
nihawačor ‘I am soaping him’. The loan can also be found in a compound with the
classifier -pa ‘flat & round’, as in hawpa ‘soap paste’. This loan is definitely not
identified as a Spanish borrowing by the speakers today.
    In the period between the 18th and the 20th century, Baures lived together with
many Spanish-speaking settlers, who learnt to speak the indigenous language, but
reinforced the inferior status of Baure. This difference in social acceptance had to
lead to the replacement of many Baure words by Spanish near equivalents. The
longer the words have been borrowed, the more they have been integrated into the
Baure phonology and morphology. An example of a rather recent replacement (be-
cause phonologically still similar) would be the word avoel for Spanish abuelo/a
‘grandfather/grandmother’, in spite of the fact that there are more specific Baure
words: -ašok ‘grandfather’ and -os ‘grandmother’. There may be an additional reason
for replacements of this kind: Baure grammar is very different from Spanish, and
many speakers have rather adapted the Spanish way of thinking, which sometimes
makes it difficult to understand the much more specific subdivisions of nouns we find
in Baure (cf. Chapter 4). In Table 1.3 there are some of the most frequently used re-
placements listed with comments on the original Baure words.
    The majority of Spanish loans are nouns, but as tables 1.2 and 1.3 show, also
some other parts of speech are borrowed. Spanish borrowings are best identified by
their different phonology, that allows, for example, consonant clusters that do not
occur in Baure otherwise, and that includes different phonemes than we find in
Baure, for instance [l] as in livor ‘book’ derived from Spanish libro. There may also
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                   15
be borrowings from other languages than Spanish, like the word for the bird ‘swal-
low’ mehelele, the only word with the phoneme [l] in Baure that does not seem to
have a Spanish origin. But there is more evidence for loans from another language
than Spanish. Some words simply do not fit in the typical Baure phonetic or morpho-
logical structure, and the morphemes do not seem to carry any meaning elsewhere in
Baure. The items tend to have an alternative word in Baure. Possible examples are
šokoma’ ‘deaf’ – with the two alternatives mosenokier and mosompoekon ‘deaf,
without hearing’ in Baure – and the word -čawriwe’/-čowrie’ ‘leg’, which was only
used by two speakers (and one of them used it only in a narrative) and co-exists with
the alternative -pes ‘leg’ and the more specific names for parts of the leg. It is espe-
cially difficult to find out more about the origins of loans because knowledge about
the surrounding languages is either scarce or was not obtained before the languages
became extinct.

Table 1.3: Replacement of Baure words by Spanish loansThe most recent borrowings of the speakers today are mainly very spontaneous – or
cases of code-switching – of a speaker who cannot find the word and is temporarily
urged to replace it by a Spanish one. Among these borrowings we find elements of all
kinds of parts of speech, many, more specifically, from the class of verbs. These bor-
rowings are not stable or fixed parts of the Baure vocabulary, but they follow certain
rules. For example all borrowed verbs are suffixed by a so-called verbalizer -čo (cf.
Table 1.3), which functions as an applicative suffix in common Baure verbs (cf.
6.4.3). The longer a consultant speaks Baure during a fieldwork session, however, the
less Spanish borrowings of this type occur. A comparable phenomenon accounts for
grammatical constructions: for example benefactive and causative (very unlike Span-
ish) are constructions rather specific to Baure and unlike the Spanish construction. In
narratives speakers make frequent use of the typical polysynthetic predicates with the
causative prefix or the benefactive suffix, cf. (3) and (4):

The affixes for causative and benefactive are directly attached to the verb bases. This
process is complicated from the point of view of Spanish grammar. The isolating
constructions, on the other hand, do not derive new verb bases and therefore the
speakers can use these constructions, when they are not acquainted with the mor-
phology of Baure so well any more, but still remember simple verb bases such
as -aya- ‘desire’, -kotorek- ‘work’, and -won- ‘send’.
    It is sometimes very difficult to decide if certain constructions have been part of
the Baure grammar already before the intense and constant influence of Spanish. We
have to accept that influences from the side of Spanish have changed the language.
However, Baure speakers are aware of the borrowing of lexical items from Spanish,
and the ones who want to speak perfectly, are very keen to replace all the spontane-
ous borrowings by Baure words. The isolating constructions of the examples above
are not interpreted as Spanish borrowings.","[34, 35, 36, 37, 38]"

   In 22 pages the phonology is presented, the arguments for each spelling proposal, and the nominal mor-
phology; in 15 pages there is a dictionary that excludes verbs and adjectives (because of the lack of knowl-
edge after the first year of study).

   In 31 pages the verbal system is described; in 11 more pages there is a dictionary of verbs and adjec-
tives.

   The booklet of 22 pages contains many pictures, basic vocabulary, examples of classification with nu-

20                                                   BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
On my second trip to Baures I had the advantage of being able to communicate more
or less in the language. This allowed me to also involve speakers who were not used
to translate or analyze their language, whose data I transcribed with the help of other
speakers. I also got to know what it means for a language to be dying: some speakers
that I had interviewed the year before had died in the meantime35, some others had
become too old and sick to work with. On the other hand, some speakers were so
busy in the politics concerning their TCO (cf. 1.1.5) that lack of time became an ob-
stacle.
    My third trip to Baures was in the rainy season, which had some advantages. First
of all I was able to understand another part of their lives, since the rainy season is a
difficult time. Secondly, some speakers were less busy, because they did not go to
their field every day. Unfortunately it is also the time of illness, and one of my main
consultants was not in town, but in hospital in Trinidad.
    I basically worked with 15 consultants, listed in Table 1.5. There were three cou-
ples among my consultants, which proved to be a great advantage for the recording of
dialogues. These speakers had more opportunities to practice speaking Baure in the
last decades, whereas those married to someone without knowledge of Baure took
longer to remember their language. It is generally important if the speakers grew up
speaking Baure to the parents or not, for which reason this question was part of the
first interviews (cf. Table 1.5).
    Among the people that were involved with my investigation of Baure that are not
in Table 1.5. I first want to mention Mercedes Peña Omopi [MP]36. She was a Baure
speaker and had rather restricted knowledge of Spanish. She spoke Baure to her hus-
band and to her parents, who were Baure monolinguals. She was approximately 80
years old when a teacher recorded her singing and speaking. I have also analyzed
these recordings in my data. She died age 82. Mercedes Peña Omopi was the mother
of three of my main informants: Rosalía, Guillermina, and Juanita Pinaicobo Peña.
The family tree in Appendix D represents part of their family and shows the progress
of language loss across three generations. Further I worked with the following speak-
ers only once or twice, but some examples of their contributions may be presented in
this grammar37 (the codes in brackets are used for references in the examples of this
grammar, cf. :
Isabel Imanareico Esero [II]: She was 61 in 2003, and she has been the president of
the women’s indigenous organization for many years. She uses the numeral ponoš
(one-CLF:human-one) to refer to any object, but sometimes also attaches classifiers.
Because of the inconsistency of her data I did not work much with her.
Rafaela Imopoco [RI]: She was 71 in 2003 and lives in El Cairo.
Mirian Melgar [MM]: She was 44 in 2003 and lives in Jasiaquiri. Her mother, who
was said to be the last Baure monolingual, had died one year before my first time in35
   During my work on the Baure language two speakers died: “Sower” Isabel Sosa (84) died at the turn of
the year 2003, and Julian Imanareico died in 2005.

   These abbreviations are later used as references for the examples.

   These consultants are not part of Table 1.5, as I only have incomplete knowledge of their dates, and they
only played a marginal role in the linguistic data.

the field. She must be a perfect Baure speaker, but when I went to see her, she was so
shy that she hardly spoke a word. As there are other speakers, I did not want to per-
suade her to work with me. From the only interview with her I cannot even say if she
is a competent speaker.
Pedro Ortíz Melgar [PO]: He was my host and can be considered a semi-speaker. He
is approximately 60 years old and grew up in the small community of San Francisco,
which hardly exists today. He helped me sometimes start a conversation in Baure
with other Baure speakers. Even though his competence is very restricted, he was of
great help.
Candelaria Sosa [CS]: She was too busy working in the chocolate factory when I
wanted to work with her, but she is a competent speaker of approximately 60 years.
“Sower” Isabel Sosa [IS]: She died in 2003 age 84. She spoke broken Spanish only,
therefore it was difficult for me to work with her in the first year.

1.3.3. Data collection, storage, and representation
Before the first field trip I had time to prepare myself with the help of the data pub-
lished by Baptista & Wallin (1967, 1968), and the grammatical descriptions by the
Jesuits (Magio 1749; Asis Coparcari 1767 in Adam & Leclerc 1880). A preliminary
analysis of their data gave me a first understanding of the language and allowed me
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                               23
to prepare a word list and a grammar check list (including the numerals marked by
different classifiers e.g.).
    Every interview was first recorded on minidisk and then, right after the inter-
views, transcribed by me alone. In the next session the transcription was corrected
together with the speaker. For all important interviews that included narratives or
unusual grammatical phenomena I produced copies on cassettes, of which one copy
was given to the speakers and another one was saved as a backup in case the mini-
disks would broke or got lost.
    On my second fieldtrip I could take a laptop, so that the next step, putting the data
into the computer, could be done in the field as well. For all data storage I used the
Shoebox program developed by SIL38. On the second fieldtrip I also had a video
camera with which I recorded narratives, including gesturing.
    I recorded every session, especially because of the very difficult phonology (cf.
Chapter 2). One major part of the data can be considered elicitation. However, elicit-
ing I never asked for paradigms, because this proved to be too difficult for the speak-
ers and unreliable as data. The majority of elicitation had to be imaginary conversa-
tion, the best way for the speakers to come up with certain expressions and reliable
data. I generally mentioned certain semantic fields. Then the speakers generally
started to talk spontaneously about things connected to that. Many speakers did so in
imagining conversations with others, such as their children or parents. Every gram-
matical form was double-checked for the correctness with other speakers. Therefore
those examples taken from elicitation in this grammar have always been approved by
other speakers, and they are generally reliable and not accidental. The main analysis
is based on texts. These texts are conversations among two speakers, or narratives
and songs. Among my consultants there are only three women, all sisters, and one
man who remember Baure narratives and songs. I recorded 13 narratives, three of
which I have in two or more versions and by various speakers. Furthermore, there are
some personal stories of an occurrence the speaker remembered. There are 7 recorded
conversations of two speakers each. In the first year I also invented narratives dealing
with the Baures’ environment (at home and in the field), which various speakers
translated from Spanish into Baure. These artificial stories helped me in getting more
fluent text data of speakers who are not capable of telling stories otherwise. All the
data together constitute approximately 70 hours of recordings.
    Finally, I also tried to use some questionnaires, such as the Perfect Questionnaire
(Dahl 2000: 800–809)39, the Lingua Descriptive Studies Questionnaire (Comrie &
Smith 1977), and the Typological Questionnaire on Imperative Constructions
(Xrakovskij 2001); and the Topological Relations Picture Series (Bowerman 1993)40
and the frog story (Mayer 1980)41.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"
"10.2.8. The role of the indefinite pronoun to ka in relative clauses
The indefinite pronoun to ka ‘someone, something’ is used frequently to replace the
head of a RC, but it also functions as a relative pronoun. This type of RC is used
much more frequently than any of the above described by their own. This pronoun
can occur with any kind of subordinate constructions described in 10.2.1 through
10.2.7. There are three examples of the different positions of RC with to ka: ante-
posed in (84), postponed in (85), and inserted in (86).

       ‘No, he said, what do I know, over there or put me – what is enough (lit. it
       makes) – on the ground.’                                      [RP-N3-20]
The indefinite pronoun to ka can be analyzed as an optional marker when subordina-
tion is itself marked on the predicate. But there are, on the other hand, subordinate
clauses that are only marked by to ka, as e.g. in (84) to (86). Only in negative and
410                                        BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
interrogative clauses the use of to ka seems indispensable for marking all types of
subordination. In (87) and (88) there are two more examples with to ka and a follow-
ing RC that is marked, in (87) by the action nominalizer -čo ‘NOM2’ and in (88) by
the locative morpheme -yi.

       2SG=take ART 2SG=house
       ‘You will load wherever you go, you will take your house.’        [RP-23/7/04-6]
In both examples (87) and (88) to ka is used as an indefinite pronoun, which is
‘something’ in the first and ‘wherever’ in the second, where the locative suffix adds
to the meaning of the pronoun.
    The indefinite pronoun to ka in interrogative clauses is found in all constructions
described in 9.4.3. One example is shown in (89):
(89)   aiy senior, woyikon-niš to ka nkotorekpa?
       aiy senior    woyiko-no=niš          to   ka       ni=kotorek-pa
       O dear        be.I-NOM1=EXCLA ART IND              1SG=work-GO
       ‘O dear, what is it that I go to work?’                        [HC-6/7/04-49]
An alternative to the form of the question in (89) is woyikon-niš to nkotorekpa, and
there is no obvious meaning difference. It seems that to ka is only used to emphasize
the subordination.
    The most common negative construction with the indefinite pronoun is nka to ka,
which literally means ‘nothing, no-one’, but it generally functions as an existential
predicate ‘there is nothing/no-one’. The verbal predicate that follows this predicate is
in fact a RC with participant nominalization -no ‘NOM1’ (10.2.1) or an unmarked RC.
The negative existential construction is demonstrated in example (90):
(90)   nka to ka askoni.
       nka to        ka    asko=ni
       NEG    ART    IND   help=1SG
       ‘There is no-one who helps me.’                           [LO/GP-15/7/04-156]
Further, to ka occurs on various negative complements. Whether to ka itself can be
analyzed as a complementizer, is a matter of analysis, as in the majority of examples
it gets the complementizer apo ‘if, that’ added. All examples in this section can be
thought of with the complementizer in addition (nka) to ka apo, but pronounced
[ngat kap]. In (91) the matrix verb -čo- ‘know’ is followed by a complement
CHAPTER 10 - CLAUSE COMBINING AND CLAUSE EMBEDDING                                 411
marked by to ka, and in (92) the non-verbal predicate ihirikowon ‘maybe’ functions
as the matrix predicate.
(91)   nka vičowor to ka ver rinik ti noiy posare-ye.

       ‘We don’t know it that/if she already ate in another place.’ [JC-13/7/04-133]

       ‘Maybe I know (how to do it).’                                 [RP-9/7/04-81]
The pronoun to ka seems to function as a general separating element for main clause
and subordinate clause, where the specific interpretations depend on the type of sub-
ordination. I think to ka shows how closely related RC and complementation are in
principle in Baure.","[431, 432, 433]"
"6.3.4. The subjective suffix -’ino ‘SUBJ’
The suffix -’ino can generally be translated as ‘want to’, and thus could be called a
desiderative suffix. However, the intention of the subject is generally less important
or missing completely. This morpheme marks nearly all verbs involving emotion,
sensation, and mental and bodily function as an obligatory part of the verb base. For
the Baures -’ino is always related to the heart. Therefore etoko’in ‘heart’ also con-
tains it. In a derivation with the subjective suffix this plays a role, as in (45):
(45)    rowono’inokoni.
        ro=wono-’ino-ko=ni
        3SGm=send-SUBJ-ABS=1SG
        ‘He sent me with his heart.’                                     [DC-16/3/06-54]
Verbs containing the subjective suffix in their base are listed in Table 6.9:

 -topo’in-                  assume (wrong)              -tokono’in-   feel cold
Table 6.9: Verbs containing the subjective suffix -’ino ‘SUBJ’Some of the verb bases in Table 6.9 may have been derived. At least -hino’inok-
‘think’ has been derived from -hinok- ‘see’. The subjective suffix is more frequently
used for derivation in combination with the approximate suffix (6.3.3). Only very few
verbs can be derived with the subjective suffix alone, as (45) above and (46), which
has been derived from -ipik- ‘be afraid of’.

The stem suffix -i, glossed as ‘durative (DUR)’ (Baptista & Wallin 1967:66), does
seem to mark durativity, but it may also affect the valency and the roles of the argu-
ments. The durative meaning may be the original connotation, but it may then have
led to the reinterpretation of certain derived forms, as will be shown below. It is also
possible that this suffix is related to the emphatic marker, which alternates between -
i’ and -ikoe’ ‘EMPH’, but generally occurs exclusively at the end of words (cf. (30)).
    The durative suffix is always attached directly preceding the stem suffixes -ko
‘ABS’ or -čo ‘APPL’, which determine the limits of the base. Verb bases lacking this
final stem suffix get it attached after the durative suffixation. The durative suffix is
generally assimilated, frequently as -e after a preceding o or a. Example (48) is the
durative form of the verb in (47):
(47)   nti’ nisompovi.
       nti’ ni=sompo-wo=pi
       1SG 1SG=hear-COP=2SG
       ‘I hear you.’
(48)   nisompoek.
       ni=sompo-i-ko
       1SG=hear-DUR-ABS
       ‘I am listening.’                                              [DC-10/4/06-77]
The verb base -sompoek- ‘listen’ has been derived from -sompo- ‘hear’ by inserting
the durative morpheme -i. The durative verb -sompoek- ‘listen’ describes an action
that lasts a bit longer than the simple verb -sompo- ‘hear’ (cf. Comrie 1976:41). An
additional effect that can be observed: the durative verb is intransitive. This valency
decreasing effect can also be observed with other verbs, as e.g. -išoerek- ‘cook, intr.’
< -išoera ‘cook, tr.’. The verb -nowana- ‘say goodbye’ is transitive, as illustrated in
(49), and the durative form -nowanoek- is intransitive (50). Other examples are listed
in Table 6.10 below.
(49)   pinowanapapori.
       pi=nowana-pa-po=ri
       2SG=say.goodbye-GO-PRFLX=3SGf

       ri=nowana-i-ko-pa-po

CHAPTER 6 - VERBAL MORPHOLOGY                                                        233
As many intransitive verbs, the form in (50) is marked by -po ‘PRFLX’. No object can
be marked on the verb, nor appear as an explicit NP. Nonetheless, there are also dura-
tive verbs with object marking, as in (51):
(51)   pehmoekperi ač nka pamomaw teč koromok.
       pi=eh-mo-i-ko-pa=ri                  ač            nka
       2SG=wash-CLF:woven-DUR-ABS-GO=3SGf and             NEG        pi=amo-mo-a-wo                         teč        koromok
        2SG=wash.well-CLF:woven-LK-COP DEM2m cloth
        ‘You washed clothes for her and you didn’t wash that cloth well.’
                                                                      [DC-17/4/06-62]
Generally, the verb -ehmoek- ‘wash clothes’ is used as an intransitive verb. This is
not related to the incorporated classifier, which does not exclude object marking.
However, in (51) there is object marking with the enclitic -ri ‘3SGf’. The object is the
person that is washed for (recipient), and not the patient that undergoes the washing.
The washing (patient) may not be referred to by an object enclitic on the durative
verb, in contrast to the original verb -ehma- ‘wash clothes’. Thus there is a change in
the semantic role of the marked object argument. The same can be observed in other
examples, as in (52) and (53):
(52)   niwonoekowori.
       ni=wono-i-ko-wo=ri
       1SG=send-DUR-ABS-COP=3SGf
       ‘I am sending to her (something).’                                [GP-9/4/06-1]
(53)   ropomoekperi.
       ro=pomo-i-ko-pa=ri
       3SGm=ask.for-DUR-ABS-GO=3SGf
       ‘He goes to ask for her (to get married).’                      [GP-9/4/06-32]
The verb -wono- ‘send’ is transitive and the objects may be persons or things which
are sent (patients). The derived form in (52) carries an object enclitic referring to a
person as the recipient of what is being sent. The same holds for (53): while the sim-
ple verb -pomo- generally means ‘ask for something/ a favour’, the derived form
means ‘ask for a person’, in a marriage proposal.
    In Table 6.10 a number of durative derivations are listed. The column referring to
O shows the semantic role of the object (P=patient; R=recipient; h=human).
    The durative suffix may thus also be analyzed as a kind of applicative suffix. It is
also possible that the derived verbs used to be intransitive, but have been reinter-
preted with new human objects. In general, human recipients are most likely to be
marked on generally intransitive verbs, which are then used transitively.

6.3.6. The distributive suffix -he ‘DISTR’
The distributive suffix is related to verbal number. It is not exclusively attached to
verbs, but also to nouns, in particular in relation to a location (cf. 4.8.3), where it
means ‘distributed over various N’. The distributive suffix -he can be attached to
nearly any transitive verb with the meaning of a plurality or totality of objects. It fre-
quently replaces an analytic way of saying ‘all’, as in (54) and (55):
(54)    roekomorohek to neč šiyenev.
        ro=ikomoro-he-ko           to neč              šiye-nev
        3SGm=kill-DISTR-ABS ART DEM2PL                 fox-PL
        ‘He killed all the foxes.’                                          [RP-N11/III-16]
(55)    nokokahekowovi.
        no=koka-he-ko-wo=pi
        3PL=laugh-DISTR-ABS-COP=2SG
        ‘They all laughed at you.’                                          [DC-8/3/06-13]
While -he refers to the plurality of the object (the foxes) in the transitive verbs in
(54), on the intransitive verb in (55) it refers to the subject. The effect of -he can be
ambiguous, but is usually interpreted from the context.
   On intransitive verbs -he can refer to the subject (when plural), as in (55) and
(56), or to the subject affected on every part of the body, as in (57), (58) and (59).

The distributive can frequently be found on verbs referring to the state of the body, as
in (58) and (59):
(58)   rokopirohew.
       ro=ko-piro-he-wo
       3SGm=ATTR-heat-DISTR-COP
       ‘He has fever.’                                                [DC-18/4/06-16]

       ‘I don’t have much power any more.’                             [JC-13/8/03-67]
When -he occurs on a derived causative verb, it generally refers to the real agent of
the action (which is then the syntactic object). It does not necessarily have to mark a
plurality of directly marked participants, but the patient must be part of a plurality
(‘among others’), as in (60):
(60)   pimoešoerehekowoni.
       pi=imo-išoere-he-ko-wo=ni
       2SG=CAUS-cook-DISTR-ABS-COP=1SG
       ‘You are making me cook (food) among others (i.e. there are more possible
       participants/cooks).’                                    [GP-11/7/04-56]
The distributive suffix does not really affect valency, but rather supports it or adds
the interpretation of a syntactically external plurality or distribution, as was shown
for example with the intransitive verbs or in (60).","[253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"
"4.8.2. Semantic extension of locative marking
In many languages the concepts of time and space are related. In Baure, however,
there is not much evidence for a connection of the two concepts. It could be expected
that locative marking could also be attached to time adverbs or nouns, but this seems
to be impossible. Only the adverb nakiroko-ye ‘once upon a time’ may be analyzed as
including the locative suffix. The names of the months can be used as temporal con-
tainers, as illustrated in (124), possibly calqued on Spanish. Also the week is inter-
preted as a time container (125):
(124) junia-ye rom nkoečapiow.
      junia-ye rom ni=koečapi-wo
      june-LOC IMM 1SG=have.birthday-COP

      -wohis means ‘hand’ and ‘finger’.

      ‘I will wait for you next week (lit. in the other week).’     [JC-13/7/04-138]
Abstract concepts, such as vekori ‘language’ or hamoro’eni ‘darkness’ can also be
marked by the locative suffix, as in (126) and (127), possibly calqued on Spanish.
(126) rowoyowoyowon hamaca vekori-ye?
      ro=woyo~woyo-wo-no            hamaca vekori-ye

      ‘I am fumbling in the darkness.’                                [GP-9/4/06-87]
In general, however, the interpretation of the suffix -ye remains locative, even when
attached to personal names, as in (128).
(128) “noiy Merse-ye-hi”, rikičowori.
      noiy Merse-ye=hi                ri=kičo-wo=ri

      ‘ “There at Mercedes’ place”, she said.’                          [RP-N4-128]4.8.3. The distributive suffix
The distributive suffix -he can be attached to nouns and verbs (cf. 6.3.6). It is fre-
quently found attached to locative nouns, where it is mutually exclusive with the plu-
ral suffix -nev. When -he ‘DISTR’ is attached to a locative noun, it generally means
that there is a number of the item bound together or in a pile or some other kind of
bound plurality. Compare (129) and (130):
(129) yakiso-ye                               (130) yakisohe-ye
      yakiso-ye                                     yakiso-he-ye
      firewood-LOC                                  firewood-DISTR-LOC
      ‘on/at the stick’                             ‘on the pile of firewood’
The distributive is like number marking, only that the actual number is not so impor-
tant itself. The most important fact is that there is something distributed over more
than one item. Examples of the use of -he in a clause are (131) and (132):
(131) kwore’ mesi-ye nikirokohe-ye.
      kwore’          mesi-ye        nikiroko-he-ye

       stone-DISTR-LOC=APRV
       ‘That was where he found him, on top of the stones, you know.’ [GP-N8-47]
The distributive functions like place noun stems in compounds involving locative
NPs. Even though it does not seem as if -he itself is a real noun stem, it can also be
found in the position of a possessed bound noun, as in (133):
(133) nihe-ye
      ni=he-ye
      1SG=DISTR-LOC
      ‘all over my body’                                           [LO/GP-25/7/04-98]
This use of the distributive suffix can be directly compared to the use of a bound
place noun in (134):
(134) ah, kewon nakon ni’api-ye.
      ah     ke-wo-no         nakon     ni=api-ye

      ‘Ah, come here, (lie down) underneath me.’                            [RP-N3-28]4.9. Adjectives classes
As explained in 3.8.3 Baure adjectives are mainly nominal by their form and morpho-
logical behaviour. They can function as modifiers in an NP, as shown here, but they
can also be used as predicate bases (cf. in 5.2). After a morphological description of
adjectives, I will illustrate the nominal (4.9.4) and verbal properties (4.9.5) of adjec-
tives. In 4.10 I refer to modification within NPs.
    There are three main morphological types of adjectives, distinguished by their
form. The closed class I of adjectives consists of right-bound roots and includes di-
mension and age adjectives and a few others. These roots occur as compounds with
classifiers, which agree with the noun they modify. Class II is semi-open, and the
adjectives are used in the absolute form, comparable to absolute nouns. This class
also includes some Spanish loans. The main characteristic of this class is that the
adjectives are unchangeable and do not show any agreement. Class III is open, and
the adjectives are derived forms, generally including the suffix -no ‘NOM1’, which is
also used in relative and interrogative clauses. These nominalized forms may incor-
porate classifiers and show agreement, but not necessarily.","[176, 177, 178]"
"8.3.1. Personal clitics
I will start with the basic, but dependent forms: the personal clitics, from which the
free pronominal forms have been derived204. The underlying forms of pro- and encli-
tics are identical, but the actual form of some of the enclitics is rather different from
the basic form due to phonological rules (cf. 2.5.5). The basic forms of the person
marking clitics are represented in Table 8.9:
                      NUMBER
 PERSON
                      SINGULAR                   PLURAL

 3 feminine           ri-
                                                 no-
 3 masculine          ro-
Table 8.9: The personal proclitics205As Table 8.9 shows, the personal clitics are all monosyllabic. The form for 1SG is
frequently reduced to bare nasal n-, and this causes the subsequent voicing of the
following plosive or affricate, when it is the initial sound of the base that it is at-
tached to (cf. 2.5.1). The plural forms have not been derived from the singular forms.
There is only a gender distinction in 3SG. It is striking that the Baure 3SG feminine
form (ri-) has developed from what is referred to as masculine or non-feminine in all
other Arawak languages. Almost all other languages of the family have a personal
form with a high front vowel that refers to non-feminine gender, and usually a (mid-
dle) back vowel which refers to feminine gender (cf. Aikhenvald 1999:88). In Baure,
however, the high front vowel is used for the feminine – ri- (3SGf) – and the middle
back vowel for masculine – ro- (3SGm). Matteson (1972:161) already remarked in
her reconstruction of Proto-Arawakan that “Baure reverses the gender markers”. The
predominance of the high front vowel also in other feminine forms is significant, as
in the demonstratives ti ‘DEM1f’, tič ‘DEM2f’, and tin ‘DEM3f’.
    The personal proclitics are used for possessor marking on nouns and for subject
marking on verbs. The enclitic forms are generally used for object cross-reference.
There can also be two of them attached to one another, referring to two objects (cf.
5.1.3). Furthermore, the subject of non-verbal predicates is encliticized as well. The
proclitics are generally obligatory, whereas the enclitics are optional with an explicit
referent, and are otherwise pronominal in nature. Personal clitics can also be attached
to the interrogative particle ko ‘why?’ (cf. 9.4.1). Finally, the 3SGm personal enclitic
204
   It is theoretically also possible that the clitics have been derived from the free pronouns.
205
   The personal cross-referencing forms are very similar in almost all Arawak languages and generally
taken as one of the main factors to determine membership of the language family (cf. 1.4).

can be found as a frozen morpheme in nouns, where it seems to have served for
nominal derivations. One example is given in Figure 8.3:
       toerok                >              toerkier
       toero-ko                             toero-ko=ro

       ‘field’                              ‘field worker’
Figure 8.2: Nominal derivation with a personal clitic
8.3.2. Unspecified e-
The prefix e- ‘UNSP’ is only attached to nouns in my data, with the exception of two
examples where it is attached to verbs in the subject slot. The morpheme e- seems to
be more like a prefix, and its application is much more reduced than that of the per-
sonal clitics. There is no derived independent form like *eti’ ‘it’206 (compare 8.3.3). It
is mainly attached to nouns referring to body parts, which have to have a possessor
marker. The idea behind it seems to be that body parts always belong to the possessor
(animal or human being), but when e- is attached, it expresses that the possessor is
unknown and unspecified. An example is shown in (38) (repeated from 4.3.1):
(38)     ntorak to eser.
         ni=torak to        e-ser
         1SG=find ART UNSP-tooth
         ‘I found a tooth.’                                                             [RP-5/7/04-59]
One could expect that the morpheme is attached to verbs as well, if the subject is un-
known. The examples occurred only in elicitation, but were later considered to be
ungrammatical by the same speaker. Nonetheless, it may be possible that the mor-
pheme attaches to verbs like nouns, because all other personal clitics behave like that.
The relevant example is:
(39)     (*)nka vičowokon ti esiaponow niweri-ye.
         nka vi=čo-wo-ko-no               ti                      e-siapo-no-wo

The verb -siap- ‘enter’ occurs in the nominalized form esipaonow in (39), because it
is part of a relative clause, introduced by the demonstrative ti ‘DEM1f’. Even though I
think it is theoretically possible that e- was also attached to verbs, there is an argu-
ment that holds against this hypothesis: There is a homophonous verbal prefix e-
‘verbalizer’, found frequently (cf. 6.3.1). This might lead to misunderstandings, gen-
erally avoided in this slot (the personal proclitics do not compete with any homopho-
nous morphemes at all).","[339, 340]"
"8.2.3. Proximate demonstratives
Proximate demonstratives are used for introducing a character, which may then also
be referred to by the same throughout the whole narration. Example (24) illustrates
the introduction of two main characters and two sentences a bit later in the same nar-
ration:

As example (24) shows, the demonstrative is widely used like an article and not nec-
essarily deictically. It may also be related to foregrounding, as it is generally attached
to the main characters throughout in a narration. This foregrounding effect probably
also causes the interpretation of different semantic roles of te/ti and teč/tič/to neč. I
noticed that in an ambiguous position following a verb teč/tič/to neč ‘DEM2’ are in-
terpreted as the agent, whereas te/ti is more frequently the patient, as demonstrated in
examples (25) and (26). The position is ambiguous when there is only one argument
following a verb, which could be agent or patient, especially when the marking on
the verb does not disambiguate it (as in (25)).

The pronoun tič in (25) is ambiguous, because both agent and patient are feminine
and therefore their semantic roles are marked on the verbs with the same clitic -ri
‘3SGf’. Nonetheless, the pronoun refers to the agent. This is supported by (26), in
which the only argument that follows the verb in the first part is ti ren ‘his mother’
and refers to the patient, while the NP tič ren ‘his mother’ in the second part clearly
refers to the agent.203
    The pointing function of teč in contrast to te was already illustrated in (24). An-
other example with this demonstrative used emphatically with a pointing gesture is:
(27)     nti’ niyok teč ka’an.
         nti’ ni=yok            teč        ka’an

The demonstrative pronoun can also be used anaphorically, referring to an afore men-
tioned item. There it may refer to animate nouns, but more frequently to things or
facts, whereas the personal pronoun is used to refer to humans. This may be observed
in (28) and (29):
(28)     kotirapiow-hi teč piti’, nen, tiow piti’ imokač tič neyon.
         kotirapi-wo=hi teč            piti’ ni=en            tiow piti’

   This is only sometimes the case, but certainly the patient may also be referred to with teč/tič/to neč, as
e.g. in (14).

As mentioned above, time adverbs are frequently used with determiners, but most of
the time with teč. This kind of marking is further found with verbs, where they turn a
clause into a temporal subordinate clause, as in (30) and (31):
(30)   teč kope’ap rišim tič rišonon.
       teč         kope’ap ri=šim          tič        ri=šonon

The demonstratives ten/tin/to nen have been subsumed under the term distal, not nec-
essarily interpreted in local terms. It can also mean disapproval and absence. When
the distal demonstrative is used with an NP, it generally moves the argument further
away from the speaker and hearer, as in (32):
(32)   ver nka to ka apo rokewkori kwore’ noiy. rohinokopow-hi to nen worapik
       arenonapik.

       who came flying like a bird.’                                    [RP-N4-51]
The distal demonstrative is often used with the negative connotation of disapproval,
as shown in (33):
(33)   nte’ čač! nimonopaša neš, tiwe’ nka pani ten ekit!
       nte’ čač      ni=imono-pa-ša neš      tiwe’ nka       pa=ni

This demonstrative is used frequently with arguments absent at the moment of speak-
ing, as in (34). There ten pi’aiy ‘your brother’ is absent, for he is hiding away afraid
to get eaten.
316                                          BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA

       I am telling you your brother arrived.” ’                        [RP-N4-86]
Example (35) was uttered when I was looking at unripe plantains, wanting to eat one
that day. The speaker went to fetch a ripe one, saying this before she left:
(35)   ač kwe’ ten pon yiyakon.
       ač     kwe’ ten          pon yi~yakon
       and exist DEM3m other INT~ripe
       ‘And there is another really ripe one.’                         [DC-15/4/06-141]
It may also be used where arguments are mentioned out of context in a narration; as
in (36), in which extra information about dolphins was provided, so that I would un-
derstand the story:
(36)   koeč to nen ikomorikonow te howe’ moeh nohinokir.
       koeč      to     nen       ikomoriko-no-wo    te                howe’

       ‘Because those who kill a dolphin can see it.’                       [GP-N1/I-33]
It is also possible to interpret the demonstrative as generic in (36) and in (37) as well:
(37)   neriki ne’ te yikepiyow kwe’ –ha– kwe’ tin marip nikon čintinev.
       neriki ne’      te       yi=kepi-yo-wo       kwe’ ha        kwe’

The descriptions of the demonstrative pronouns need more investigation, and espe-
cially a comparison with the place adverbs (Table 8.1) would be one promising as-
pect of future research.","[335, 336, 337, 338]"

Table 10.3: Complement-taking predicatesAn explicit subject may also be included in the complement clause, but it rather fol-
lows the complement verb; only nominal subjects and names may occur before the
predicate, as in (117).

The subject ti Mersedia’ ‘Mercedes’ in (117) is the subject of the complement clause.
The matrix clause has a 1SG subject, which is only marked on the matrix verb. In
fact, the complement clause can be a complex sentence including more constituents,
such as adverbials. This is exemplified in (118), in which the adverb enevere ‘next
day’ introduces the complement clause:
(118) mamit, nki’inow enevere nahkoper niyonpašapo noiy.
      mamit     ni=ki’ino-wo    enevere ni=ahko-pa=ro

In (118) there is also another complement in the complement clause. Predicate clus-
ters can be very complex, and double unmarked complementation occurs very fre-
quently, as in (119) and (120) (cf. also (121)).

      ‘Again they went to try it to smell him – nothing!’                 [RP-N11-36]
Now I want to give a few more examples of other complement taking verbs. Probably
all verbs of utterance can take a complement. In (121) the verb -ahač- ‘ask’ takes a
complement, but it is itself also the complement of the preceding verb -ki’in- ‘want’:
(121) nki’inow nahačeri noka rihinokow tič ntir novia’.
      ni=ki’ino-wo    ni=ahač=ri        noka ri=hinoko-wo

       ‘I want to ask if she hasn’t seen my girl-friend.’                  [RP-N4-83]
The complement of -ahač- ‘ask’ in (121) is negative and is therefore introduced by
the negative particle. Further the complement contains also an explicit object: tič ntir
novia’ ‘my girl-friend’.
    There are not many verbs of perception in my data, but one example with the verb
-hinok- ‘see’ is (122). The sentence is from a narrative about a time when the people
did not have fire yet.
(122) ač to yandoe’ rohinokow to čintinev nka notirow yaki.

Motion verbs can also take a complement, as already demonstrated in (121) with the
verb -kač- ‘go’. The meaning of the complementation is generally ‘to move some-
where in order to do something’ (purposive). Usually only verbs marking motion
towards are found with complements. In imperative clauses the verbs kew ‘go!’ and
kewon ‘come!’ are frequently used with a complement. The cases of -yon- ‘walk’
with a complement are much rarer. Other motion verbs are generally not found with
complements. In this respect I want to refer back to Chapter 7, in which a number of
preverbal particles were shown, some of which are identical to motion verbs. The
preverbal particles probably go back to a complement or serial verb construction
(10.3.7). It is also possible to analyze some of the clauses with motion verbs as asyn-
detic coordination. This sometimes depends on the interpretation. In the two subse-
quent sentences in (123) there are examples of this type of complementation.
(123) “ntori, kewon vinikpan!” boen, ver rokačow-hi ronikpa.
      ni=tori       ke-wo-no         vi=nik-pa-no        boen

       PERF   3SGm=go-COP=QUOT 3SGm=eat-GO
       ‘ “My friend, come so that we eat!” Well, he went to eat.’    [RP-N2/II-18/19]
It is possible to analyze the predicates in the first sentence – kewon vinikpan ‘come so
that we eat’ – as two clauses in unmarked coordination, as the two events ‘come’ and
‘we eat’ can be regarded as separate events that happen one after the other. In the
second sentence in (123) ronikpa ‘he went eat’ is the complement of the verb ro-
kačow-hi ‘he went’ in my analysis.
     Many other verbs can take complements, but only a few more will be exemplified
here. The verb -pa- from the list of Table 10.3 is generally not the matrix verb in a
complement construction, but in (124) it is. The unmarked complement occurs right
after the matrix verb:
(124) pikanačani nti’, nipapi pinik.
      pi=kanača-ni         nti’ ni=pa=pi              pi=nik

      ‘If you win over me, I give you to eat.’                            [JP-N10-10]
The verbs -ah(ik)- ‘try’, -ita- ‘continue’, -čona- ‘accompany’ are found frequently
with a complement. It may be important to repeat here that none of the complement-
taking predicates have an obligatory complement, and they are therefore not matrix
verbs in the strict sense. Finally, a non-verbal predicate that can be used with an un-
marked complement: nka henowor ‘it is not good’ (125).

In (125) the complement is unmarked. However, a marked complement is also possi-
ble with a meaning difference, resulting in noka henowor ‘he is not good at’ (126),
and in order to lead up to the following section there is an example in (126) for com-
parison:

Nearly any predicate can take a marked complement or marked subordinate clause.
The types of complements will be described in this section. Some complement-taking
predicates from the preceding section can alternatively be used in the marked con-
struction, usually with no meaning difference. The matrix predicate can be directly
followed by the marked complement (127), or the complement is preceded by a de-
terminer (as in the RC), which functions as a complementizer in these constructions
(128), the latter being the case in the majority of marked complement constructions.
(127) pivetkowor piwoiykoč te wotoki.
      pi=ivetko-wo=ro            pi=woiyko-čo           te         wotoki

In both examples, (127) and (128), the verb -ivetko- ‘be able’ is followed by a
marked complement clause. In (127) the complement is juxtaposed to the matrix
verb, whereas in (128) the complement is preceded by the article to, which shows
that the predicate has changed into the nominal category.
    One major group of predicates that take a marked complement is non-verbal
predicates. In (125) above there is one example of non-verbal predicate with an un-
marked complement. This is rather exceptional, and it was also used for a distinction
of meanings (compare (126)). Non-verbal predicates can be observed in clauses with
temporal (129), manner (130), and intensity (131) adverbs and many others.

The adverbs in examples (129) and (130) can also be used as particles before an un-
marked predicate, which is then not analyzed as a complement construction. This is
also the case with the preverbal particle eto ‘terminative (FINISH)’ (132, part 2). This
particle has probably been derived from a complement construction with the same
root functioning as a non-verbal predicate: eto- ‘finish’. This complement construc-
tion always has to be marked, as shown in (132, part 1):
(132) ver eton teč neparečoč ač nehemoekop. nehmoekow, ver eto nehmoekop,
      nokačpow novehšačpaw.

       ‘They finished playing and washed themselves. They washed, finished
       washing, and they went to change clothes.’             [RP-N4-57]
The verb -veyimira- ‘begin’ also takes a marked complement, shown in (133):
(133) kač veyimirap to vikotorekoč.
      kač veyimira-po             to        vi=kotoreko-čo

Then there are a number of complement-taking predicates, as e.g. -ki’in-
‘want’, -ah(i)ko ‘try’, -ita- ‘continue’, that can occur as matrix verbs of a marked
complement construction. The different constructions do not have any different inter-
pretations. Example (134) can be compared to (114) through (119) above, and (135)
to (118) and (120) of the preceding section.

The main difference in the two constructions – unmarked versus marked – is the in-
dependence of the marked clause. The nominalizer -čo ‘NOM2’ marks the clause as
subordinate and facilitates the movement within the sentence. This is not possible
with the unmarked complement construction, in which the complement always has to
follow the matrix verb. In (137) the marked complement clause may be moved to the
front of the matrix predicate.

In Table 10.3 the verb -tiri- ‘know’ is listed as a complement-taking predicate. In
general it takes unmarked complements. The derived form tirin ‘knowing’ is for-
mally a noun and takes marked complements. In addition, speakers also use the verb
-tiri- ‘know’ with a marked complement as an alternative. All three possibilities are
demonstrated in (138) through (140):

CHAPTER 10 - CLAUSE COMBINING AND CLAUSE EMBEDDING                                   427
The difference between (138) and (139) is based on the kind of predicate: the verbal
predicate in (138) is interpreted as a relatively more temporal state than the non-
verbal predicate in (139), which is translated as ‘know well’. Nonetheless, (140)
shows that a marked and unmarked construction can both occur with the verbal
predicate -tiri- ‘know’ with seemingly no meaning difference.
    Finally, marked complements can have a wider range of meanings, as for example
purposive, temporal, or reason. A purposive complement is the one in (137) ‘for buy-
ing meat’. A temporal interpretation of a complement can be observed in (141):
(141) neriki ne’ teč nošimač to pore’ ač –ha– nka nosokiaw to neron.

In (142) the complement is the reason why the man in the narrative cries:

Payne defines serial verbs as follows:
       “A serial-verb construction contains two or more verb roots that are neither
       compounded […] nor members of separate clauses.” (Payne 1997:307)
Serial verb constructions are well-known from West Africa, the Caribbean, and South
east Asia.. Payne refers to verb roots in his definition. However, other studies (eg.
Sebba 1997) take a wider view. Finite verbs with possible person cross-reference on
the verb, as in Baure, may also occur in serial verb constructions. As mentioned
above, serial verb constructions are distinguished from verb or predicate coordination
(described in 10.3.1 to 10.3.3). The main distinction is that in a serial construction
there is only one event, whereas in coordination the predicates refer to separable
events. The coordination of predicates is identical with the coordination of clauses
without connector. Serial verb constructions, on the other hand, are a number of
verbs that are uttered in one clause. In Baure the two categories seem pretty well dis-
tinguishable, whereas in other languages coordinated constructions may also be ana-
lyzed as serial constructions (cf. Sebba 1997:195).
    In the serial verb construction in Baure all verbs contain obligatorily subject
cross-reference, except for cases where the serial construction is part of a subordinate
428                                        BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
clause. In the series of verbs none is subordinate to the other. In my Baure data there
are no serial verb constructions with more than two verbs. The construction reminds
one of the apposition of NPs described in 10.2.9. It can be regarded as a kind of ver-
bal apposition. Sometimes one verb is more general and the other more specific in for
example the kind of motion, as in the following example:
(143) čas mončiwoni nikač niyonpoek šonoki-ye.
      čas         monči-wo=ni      ni=kač ni=yon-poek           šonoki-ye
      long.ago child-COP=1SG 1SG=go 1SG=walk-down way-LOC
      ‘In earlier times when I was a child, I walked barefoot that way.’[JC-7/3/06-4]
In (143) the speaker uses two verbs to refer to the event of walking: the first one is
the general verb -kač- ‘go’, and the second one specifies the event by the
verb -yonpoek- ‘walk barefoot (lit. walk down)’. Both verbs cross-refer to the 1SG
subject by the proclitic ni-. The verb -kač- is also used in complement constructions.
It generally means ‘to go to do something’, but can also refer more abstractly to a
future event or intention. A complement construction with the two predicates is pos-
sible with future reference, as e.g. in the order pikač piyonpoek! (2SG=GO 2SG=walk-
down) ‘Go and walk barefoot!’. Further more, the verb root -kač- ‘go’ is also used as
a preverbal particle (cf. 7), which probably goes back to a reduction of the comple-
ment construction. In (144) the serial construction from Table 10.2 is repeated. The
first verb is also -kač- ‘go’, but the second one is the verb -pin- ‘flee’. Both verbs
refer to the same event.
(144) rokačpow ropinop.

Another example with a different verb of motion is found in (145):
(145) nošim nohasopikow to neč tekow to ka apo teč nariačowon.

In (145) the event of arriving is specified by the second verb nohasopikow ‘they
come as a caravan’, which contains the verbal morpheme or root -pik- ‘come’. Both
events happen at the same time: ‘they arrive’ and ‘they come (in a specific way)’. In
the next example the serial construction consists of two verbs of utterance.

In (146) the two verbs -koponia- ‘answer’ and -kič- ‘say’ occur in a serial construc-
tion, but the second one is more general. Maybe -kič- functions as a complementizer
in (146), as in African languages and Caribbean creoles (cf. Sebba 1997:196–197).
    An instrumental meaning in Baure, a language that does not have adpositions,
translated as ‘with’ into English can be gained with the verb -ina- ‘use’, as demon-
strated in (147).

Further on, comparison is indicated with the verbs -erok- ‘surpass’ and -ino- ‘be like’

When someone wants to point at the similarity of an action the verb -ino- ‘be like’ is
used. This verb for comparison is also applied as a serial verb right after the predicate
it refers to. In (150) this is also a complex predicate with a complement: nki’inow
noporia’ ‘I want them to sew’. When referring to size or age there is also the alterna-
tive of incorporating the attribute into the verb -ino- ‘be like’ (cf. 5.5).

    This was the translation given by Baptista & Wallin in their data. An alternative translation could be ‘I
want them to sew like this, my pretty dress, is/looks now.’

In (150) the second predicate is non-verbal: yonačowon- ‘(be) the oldest’. There are
possibly other constructions with the verb -erok- ‘surpass’ that include verbal predi-
cates, but unfortunately the construction is not used frequently any more and there-
fore there are no more examples in the data. An alternative is an incorporated attrib-
ute in the verb -erok- ‘surpass’, as already shown in Chapter 5.

"3.8.5. Pronouns and determiners
The classes of pronouns and determiners are closed. There are seven personal pro-
nouns that have all been derived from the personal proclitics102, as e.g. piti’ ‘2SG’ <
pi- ‘2SG’. They are distinguished for person and number, and for gender in 3SG. The
possessive pronouns have been derived from the personal pronouns, as e.g. pitir
‘2SGP’ < piti’ ‘2SG’. Personal pronouns may replace a noun or refer to it as an ana-
phor, but generally they only occur in emphatic focus on the pronominalized argu-
ment. Otherwise arguments are marked by clitics on verbs. Personal pronouns also
occur in juxtaposition with unmarked non-verbal predicates. Possessive pronouns are
less frequently used for possessor marking, as this is done by possessor proclitics on
nouns. However, there are some otherwise not possessable and non-derivable nouns
that can get possessor marking by means of possessive pronouns. In this case they are
modifiers within NPs. This mainly holds for Spanish loanwords. Another important
function of possessive pronouns is that of non-verbal bases for possessive relations,
as in (84):
(84)       nka ntirowor.
           nka ntiro-wo=ro
           NEG     1SGP-COP=3SGm
           ‘It is not mine.’                                                            [DC-17/4/06-23]
Pronouns are described in 8.3. The closed class of determiners consists of one article
and three types of demonstrative pronouns. The article is actually gender-neutral, but
usually interpreted as masculine. The different types of demonstratives are distin-
guished for number and gender. They are used initial to an NP, but they can function
as free pronouns as well. Determiners do not take any affixation. Only clausal clitics
may be attached to the demonstratives, but not the article. Determiners are described
in 8.2.",[130]
"4.4.2. Human plural
As mentioned above, there is a small subgroup of human nouns that have a different
plural marking, namely with the suffix -anev ‘hPL’. This morpheme has probably
been composed of the linking morpheme -a ‘LK’ and the general pluralizer. This plu-
ral marker is predominantly applied to kinship terms, but also to a few other human
nouns, such as eton ‘woman’ and hir ‘man’, which form the plurals etonanev
‘women’ and hiranev ‘men’. But not all human nouns are part of this subclass, only a
well defined restricted number. There also seems to be a phonological restriction in-
sofar that only nouns terminating in a consonant (or a deleted final vowel -o) get this
plural marker attached, whereas human nouns terminating in a vowel get the common
form -nev attached as the other nouns. Therefore the noun nipiri ‘my sibling’ is plu-
ralized as nipirinev ‘my siblings’, and ni’aiy ‘my brother (of a woman)’ as ni’ayinev
‘my brothers’. In Table 4.11 all the human nouns that are pluralized differently are
listed:

Table 4.11: The human plural forms
4.4.3. Plural NPs
Plural does not seem to be obligatorily marked on every noun or NP that refers to a
plurality of items, just like in Arawak languages. Aikhenvald (2001:173) argues that
“plural is optional (unless the referent is human)” in North Arawak languages. This
seems to hold for Baure as well. Nouns with human referents are generally pluralized
when the speaker refers to more than one. However, the influence of Spanish on
Baure for approximately 300 years has had the effect that today many Baure speakers
who want to speak correctly have started to apply the plural suffix obligatorily to
every noun with a plural interpretation, like in Spanish, at least in elicitation. This
does not seem to reflect the original use of Baure plural marking. In narratives and
when the speakers are in conversation, plural is marked under different conditions
than in Spanish115. Generally, nouns unmarked for plural refer to either a single item
(one token) or to the concept as a mass (the type). All characters in a narrative have to
be marked when they are plural; unmarked nouns cannot refer to an individualized
plural. Domesticated animals, which are often bread in herds or groups, are usually
referred to by the unmarked (generic) form, as e.g. tiporek ‘chicken’ in (34) through
(36).
(34)    ten nop renpen to tiporek.

(35)    nipikow to tiporek.

115
   On the other hand we can notice a Baure-like generic use of singular/unmarked forms in the regional
Spanish as well, which intermingles with the lack of final -s (among others the plural morpheme)
pronunciation.

All three examples have generic reference. The NP to tiporek ‘the chicken’ in (34) is
a partitive NP and only refers to chickens as a type. In (36) the person cross-reference
marker that refers to the chicken is ro- ‘3SGm’, thus also singular, but the sentence
refers to chickens in general and not one chicken in particular. It could be expected
that the person cross-reference concords with the marked number of the NP referred
to, but this is not always the case. There are numerous examples with plural marking
on the verb or non-verbal predicate, but no plural marking on the referent. This is
exemplified with tiporek ‘chicken’ in (37) and (38):
(37)    tekow to roseskoner nohinoekow nonik to tiporek.
        tek-wo    to     roseskoner no=hinoeko-wo no=nik                           to     tiporek

        no=woko-i-wo-no                                          to       tiporek

There is evidence that the plural morpheme is in fact a phrasal suffix. The plural
morpheme -nev is phonologically extrametrical in a word, i.e. it does not cause any
stress shift (cf. 2.4). On the other hand, there are many examples where -nev ‘PL’
only attaches to the last element of an NP, as in (39) and (40):
(39)    dies to nipirinev116 – eton ač hiranev.
        dies to        ni=piri-nev     eton     ač                    hir-anev
        ten     ART    1SG=sibling-PL woman and                       man-hPL
        ‘I have ten siblings, women and men.’                                           [MC-9/8/03-4]

        ‘I give food to my chickens.’                 [GP/LO-21/7/04-111]
Even though niper ‘my domesticated animal’ can be pluralized on its own as
nipernev, it is not pluralized in (40), where the speaker actually refers to a plurality of
animals. Plural marking is only found on the last noun tiporekonev ‘chickens’, and it
is evident from the cross-referencing on the verb. The same behaviour of the plural116
    In the plural -pirinev ‘siblings’ does not mean necessarily ‘sibling of the same sex’, or at least the
speaker does not use it as such in this example.

morpheme can be observed when adjectives are part of the NP. When these adjec-
tives follow the head noun, then only they get plural marking, as in (41) and (42):
(41)       monik te piser tisčinev.
           monik     te          pi=ser        ti-s-či-nev
           pretty    DEM1m       2SG=tooth     small-CLF:stick-DIM-PL
           ‘Your small and slim teeth are pretty.’                                     [HC-27/7/04-93]
(42)       nokiepon to per kove’ čačanev?

          3PL=EV-PRFLX-NOM1 ART 2SG.dom.animal dog big-CLF:animal-AUG-PL
           ‘Where are your big dogs?’                    [LO/GP-18/7/04-65]
In contrast to (41) and (42), it seems to be the tendency that in predicate construc-
tions with adjectives that follow the head noun, both, the noun and the adjective are
marked plural (and are therefore rather regarded as two separate phrases), while in
modifying constructions with adjectives only the last element of the whole phrase is
marked. This is at least the case in examples where the two are juxtaposed and could
be interpreted as both (cf. 5.3 on unmarked predicate constructions by juxtaposition).
Generally, when the predicate precedes the subject NP, the NP is distinguished as a
separate phrase by means of a determiner117, as in (43) and (44). The predicative ad-
jective can be marked for plural or not when preceding the other NP (43).
(43)       čonok to ka’anonev
           čonok     to     ka’ano-nev
           big       ART    animal-PL
           ‘The animals are big.’

           čonoko-nev to        ka’ano-nev
           big-PL       ART     animal-PL
           ‘The animals are big.’
When the adjective follows the head, it can also function as a predicate, but the con-
struction remains ambiguous when it is not marked, cf. (45) and (46):
(45)       to neč ka’an čonokonev
           to     neč       ka’an             čonoko-nev

           ‘those big animals’                                                               [RP-N3-201]

           ART   DEM2PL animal-PL      big-PL
           ‘Those animals are big.’
Many examples support the status of -nev as a phrasal suffix, but there are also many
inconsistent examples, which complicate the analysis.","[151, 152, 153, 154]"
"3.4.1. Personal clitics
What is called personal clitics in Baure, has previously just been categorized as af-
fixes (e.g. by Baptista & Wallin 1967). The attachment of personal morphemes dif-
fers notably from general affixation and therefore it is necessary to mark this differ-
ence. Personal clitics are more clitic-like than the other grammatical affixes, while
they also share some characteristics with them. The most important criteria for clitic
status are phonetic boundedness, the external position in respect to affixation, the
syntactic function in a verb phrase, and the general attachment to a number of word
classes in variant positions. The arguments for and against the clitichood of the per-
sonal morphemes are discussed in this section (cf. also Halpern 1998, Anderson
1992, and Aikhenvald 2002).
 (a) Baure personal clitics are unstressed (phonologically dependent)100 morphemes
which always attach to a host and do not exist as independent words. They are used
as proclitics for possessor marking on nouns (26) and subject marking on verbs (27):
100
    A personal enclitic may even phonologically cliticize to the following word, or a proclitic to the preced-
ing, within a phonological phrase (cf. 2.6).

(b) They are used as enclitics for object marking on verbs, as in (28) and (29), and
subject marking on non-verbal predicates (30):
(28)   nikičowor.
       ni=kičo-wo=ro
       1SG=say.do-COP=3SGm
       ‘I am telling him.’                                                [GP-N1/II-1]

(30)   nitovianowor.
       ni=toviano-wo=ro
       1SG=neighbour-COP=3SGm
       ‘He is my neighbour.’
Personal enclitics are also used for subject or object marking on the interrogative
particle ko ‘why’, as in (31) and (32):
(31)   kopi kačowon?
       ko=pi       kačo-wo-no
       why=2SG     go-COP-NOM1
       ‘Why do you go?’                                                [MD-30/8/03-4]
(32)   koro pikomorikon?
       ko=ro        pi=ikomoriko-no
       why=3SGm 2SG=kill-NOM1
       ‘Why did you kill it?’                                          [MD-6/3/06-27]
(c) Even though clitics share many characteristics with affixes, generally, clitics have
greater mobility with respect to the base than inflectional affixes (Halpern 1998:106).
As illustrated above, the personal clitics in Baure occur on different sides of the
hosts, depending on the kind of construction. Affixes in Baure always occur in spe-
cific orders and slots, with little variation.
 (d) Personal clitics are the base of free pronouns, as e.g. roti’ ‘3SGm’ < ro- ‘3SGm’.
In addition they occur in some idiosyncratic forms (Aikhenvald 2002:55), as in (33):
94                                          BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA
(33)   roseskoner
       ro=ses-ko-no=ro
       3SGm=sun-ABS-NOM1=3SGm
       ‘day’
(e) Cliticization is external to any affixation on the predicate (cf. Halpern 1998:108–
9). Only clausal clitics follow personal enclitics; personal proclitics are not preceded
by any clitics.
 (f) Another phenomenon distinguishes the personal proclitics from affixes: The
pausal particle –ha– ‘HES’ cannot interrupt a unit of a base and affixes, but the pause
occurs frequently right after a personal proclitic. This happens when the speaker is
looking for a word, as in (34), where my consultant was searching the word pi’a
‘your body’.

       so that we get rid of the dirt on your body.’                [HC-2/7/04-19]
The proclitic pi- ‘2SG’ occurs on its own, but is then again repeated attached to the
word pi’a-ye ‘on your body’. This is also due to the boundedness of the noun, which
cannot occur without possessor marking. Nonetheless, this shows the relatively free
character of this morpheme in contrast to all other affixes, but also to the personal
enclitics.
 (g) The proclitics for 3SG on verbs are sometimes replaced by determiners: ro-
‘3SGm’ can be replaced by to ‘ART’, and ri- ‘3SGf’ by ti ‘DEM1f’. This was not ob-
served with the other clitics.
There are also some important points to be brought forward against the clitichood of
the personal morphemes:
 (h) personal proclitics are obligatory and show therefore more affix-like characteris-
tics than personal enclitics. They co-occur with the explicit argument they refer to
and seem to be a kind of person and number agreement (cf. roti’ ‘3SGm’ in (35)).
 (i) Personal enclitics, on the other hand, are not obligatory, but pronominal in nature.
They are generally in complementary distribution with the explicit arguments they
refer to, as in (35):
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES                                              95

        ‘He bought it; he bought me shoes (lit. my shoes).’      [GP-11/7/04-26/27]
(j) There are special rules that only apply to the personal enclitics -pi ‘2SG’, -ri
‘3SGf’, -ro ‘3SGm’, and -no ‘3PL’. These four selected clitics show an intensive pho-
nological interaction between clitic and host, which cannot be found between base
and affixes (examples have been discussed in 2.5.6).
    It is true that in general affixation takes place within the boundaries of personal
cross-reference cliticization. Nevertheless, there is one exception to this: The nomi-
nalizing suffix -no ‘NOM1’ can be attached to a verb with personal enclitic as a kind
of phrasal suffix in interrogative constructions (see above in example (15)). The
nominalizer then has the entire verb in its (clausal) scope, as in (36):
(36)    rokomorokiyivin kove’?
        ro=komoroki-yi-wo=pi-no                         kove’

In conclusion, personal clitics appear on the path of grammaticalizing into agreement
markers, but are still rather clitic-like in behaviour (cf. also Aikhenvald 2002:57).
The result is a continuum, as illustrated in Figure 3.2:
bound                                                                                           free

Figure 3.2: The continuum from affix to free particlePersonal proclitics are closer to the bound side of the continuum due to their obliga-
toriness. Personal enclitics are considered to be more free (if we leave the phonologi-
cal interaction aside). Clausal clitics are very similar to free particles, and they attach
to nearly any host, for which reason they are ranked closest to the other side.","[114, 115, 116, 117]"

    In the examples the vowel -i- has changed into -e-. The additional vowel -o- might be epenthetic, but it
is here included with that morpheme. I don’t know if it could not also be the locative suffix -yi that is
generally used in questions, which is then used in a broader sense? Furthermore, the root -woiy ‘name’
could have been composed of the copula suffix -wo and the locative suffix -yi, as well.
226
    It is a fixed expression to start a clause by -činč- to, and it is generally translated as ‘whatever (the
subject) does/is’, as in e.g.     ročinč to ka royonoeyop.

9.4.3. Questions about the subject or object
As already observed in (100) and (101), the verb -woyik- ‘be.I (identity)’ can occur as
an unmarked interrogative particle woyik(o)won (woyiko-COP-NOM1), but also woy-
ikon (be.I-NOM1) and the more grammaticalized or phonologically reduced particle
kon ‘who/what’, all of them meaning something like ‘which one?’.
    In Baure this same interrogative construction is used to ask for both subject and
object; where the shorter particle kon is predominant. The particle is followed by a
kind of relative clause, in which objects are distinguished from subjects by the differ-
ence in argument marking.
    An object question is introduced by the particle kon and followed by a regular
predicate marked by a determiner, i.e. a predicate with cross-reference of subject (if a
verbal predicate) as in a declarative clause. This question can also be analyzed as
‘Which one is it that …?’. Consider the following example:
(106) kon to pinik?
      kon           to     pi=nik
      who/what      ART    2SG=eat
      ‘What will you eat?’                                             [RP-19/7/04-19]
The particle kon appears clause initially and the phrase that follows is marked by a
determiner, to ‘ART’ in (106) and teč ‘DEM2m’ in (107), which represents the long
form of the particle:
(107) woyikon teč vinikpa?
      woyiko-no     teč       vi=nik-pa
      be.I-NOM1 DEM2m 1PL=eat-GO
      ‘What are we going to eat?’                                      [HC-3/8/03-36]
The form of the main verb in these interrogative clauses, as e.g. pinik ‘you eat’ (106)
or vinikpa ‘we go to eat’ (107) is the same as in declarative clauses. No nominalizer
marks the verb, but the particle itself goes back to an originally nominalized form, cf.
Figure 9.5:

        woyiko-no

Figure 9.5: Argument marking in the object question:There is no question for an object of a ditransitive verb in my data, but I suppose that
it will only show additional object marking on the verb.
    Examples (109)–(110) demonstrate the alternative unmarked relative clause con-
structions with the indefinite pronoun to ka (cf. 10.2.8), which functions as a relative
pronoun here. The relative clause is unmarked, because generally the predicate in the
relative clause is nominalized (cf. 10.2).
(108) kon to ka pihinoekpa?

      who/what ART IND 2SG=search-GO

      ‘Oh my god, what will I do in order to go to work?’          [HC-6/7/04-49]
In (109) the interrogative particle is marked by the clausal clitic -niš ‘well’.
    The question for a subject, in contrast, is constructed with the particle kon (or the
longer form woyiko(wo)n), followed by a determiner, but with a verb without subject
cross-reference. In addition, if the predicate is based on an intransitive verb, it is
nominalized; if it is transitive, it can have the object marked, which then replaces
nominalization. This morphological strategy is identical to that in relative clauses (cf.
10.2), so that the main verb can be analyzed as part of a syntactic relative clause in
the construction. Subject questions are represented in Figure 9.6:
        (woyi)kon        DET      V-NOM1
        (woyi)kon        DET      V=O
Figure 9.6: Argument marking in the subject question:Example (110) shows how a subject question is constructed with an intransitive verb:
(110) kon to epsopoekon?

Example (111) and (112) illustrate subject questions with a transitive verb, in (111)
with an explicit object and therefore a nominalized verb and in (112) with object
marking:
(111) kon to nikon to kanikon?
      kon           to     niko-no to                   kanikon
      who/what      ART    eat-NOM1 ART                 food

A clause without subject marking is interpreted as a question for that missing argu-
ment. If the verb is ditransitive, there is always object marking, exemplified in (113):
(113) kon to pavi moeiš?
      kon       to     pa-wo=vi                    moeiš
      who/what ART give-COP=2SG                    pineapple

Non-verbal predicates can also be part of such an interrogative clause. They also lack
subject marking (which would be an enclitic, cf. Chapter 5), as in (114):
CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES                                      361

      ‘Who is the chief here in the village?’                                [GP/LO-D2-1]
Subject questions can also be constructed with a relative clause introduced by the
relative pronoun to ka (ART IND), as shown for object questions in (108) and (109):
(115) kon-niš to ka viar?
      kon=niš to        ka     via=ro
      Q=EXCLA ART       IND    take.away=3SGm

All of the above can occur in indirect questions, as illustrated in (116).","[380, 381, 382, 383]"
"5.1. Verbs and argument marking
Verbs can be intransitive, transitive, or ditransitive. These are generally not formally
distinguishable, even though certain morpheme combinations in the verbal base may
be exclusively found with intransitive verbs. The morphological processes within the
verb base and external to the verb base are described in Chapter 6. In general, many
intransitive verbs can also be used transitively, in particular with human objects.
Some intransitive verbs are listed in Table 5.1:
 verb base                translation               verb base                  translation
 -ak-                     sing                      -koso’in-                  be sad
 -či’in-                  be full up                -pin-                      flee
 -han-                    be healthy                -porok-                    be lost
 -hare-                   sunrise                   -sowe-                     rain
 -kač-                    go                        -šinik-                    hurt
 -koes-                   wake up                   -ya-                       cry

Table 5.1: Intransitive verb basesIntransitive verbs have a subject proclitic and no object marking (cf. 5.1.1). As can be
concluded from Table 5.1, some intransitive verbs are stative, others active. Stative
verbs are always intransitive, but states may also be expressed by non-verbal predi-
cates (cf. 5.2). Intransitive verbs may also have been derived from transitive verbs,
mainly by the attributive prefix ko- ‘ATTR’ (cf. 6.4.1). Weather verbs are intransitive.
    Many basic verbs may be transitive, but also a great number of transitive verbs
have been derived from intransitive verbs. The various kinds of derivation include
verb base-internal processes, such as applicative (cf. 6.4.3); others are verb base-
external, such as causative (cf. 6.5.1.1) and benefactive (cf. 6.5.1.2). A sample of
transitive verbs is given in Table 5.2, including both simple verbs and derived forms.136
   ‘every noun becomes a verb in this language [Translation S.D.]’.

   “All words except those filling interjection slot may be verbalized by affixes. Aspect suffixes act as
verbalizers.” (Baptista & Wallin, page 4 of Data check form for morphology, T-558)

Table 5.2: Transitive verb basesTransitive verbs have a subject marked by a proclitic, but may also have an object
marked by an enclitic (cf. 5.1.2). Objects may be human recipients or patients, or
non-human patients. The semantic role of the object can be indicated by specific
markers, such as causative and benefactive, but it may also simply be implied by the
verb meaning.
    Ditransitive verbs are mainly derived by the benefactive base suffix -ino ‘BEN’.
The only simple ditransitive verb is -pa- ‘give’. One object is generally the patient,
the other one the recipient. Both objects can be marked on the verb in the order re-
cipient–patient (cf. 5.1.3).
    The rules for the cross-referencing of the arguments on a verb base are described
in detail below. Figure 5.1 gives a simplified representation of the structure of a verb,
with special reference to the personal clitics: personal                                                  personal enclitics

Figure 5.1: The structure of a verb
5.1.1. Subject marking
Every verb obligatorily includes a subject proclitic, which is simply attached to the
base. The personal proclitics are shown in Table 8.9 in Chapter 8. There are only
some morphophonological changes when two vowels clash at this boundary, already
described in 2.5. The paradigms are simple, as demonstrated with an intransitive verb
in (1) and a transitive verb in (2).
(1)          -šim- ‘arrive’ (intransitive)
1SG          nišim ‘I arrived’               1PL         višim ‘we arrived’
2SG          pišim ‘you arrived’             2PL         yišim ‘you arrived’
3SGm         rošim ‘he arrived’              3PL         nošim ‘they arrived’
3SGf         rišim ‘she arrived’
CHAPTER 5 - PREDICATE TYPES AND SPECIFIC PREDICATE CONSTRUCTIONS                    175
(2)          -am- ‘take’ (transitive)
1SG          nam    ‘I take’              1PL     vam    ‘we take’
2SG          pam    ‘you take’            2PL     yam    ‘you take’
3SGm         ram    ‘he takes’            3PL     nam    ‘they take’
3SGf         riam   ‘she takes’
Since there is no tense marking in Baure, the interpretation of a situation as past or
present depends on the verb’s meaning and time adverbs in the clause. In the case of
an achievement verb, the simple form is generally interpreted as past, as in (1)
with -šim- ‘arrive’. In certain constructions, especially as a complement, the same
forms in (1) can also refer to a non-past situation. Accomplishment and active verbs,
such as -am- ‘take’ in (2), can be interpreted as both past and present, depending on
the context.
    Subject marking is like verb agreement, because the proclitic can (but need not)
co-occur with an explicit subject NP, as in (3) through (6).

Subject marking is also found on imperative and interrogative clauses (cf. 9.3 and
9.4), and on complements (10.3).","[195, 196, 197]"
"10.3.3. Temporal clauses: the role of departitive -wana in temporal clauses
The departitive morpheme -wana can generally be translated as ‘do V and go’ (cf.
6.5.2.2). The question arises why a language should have grammaticalized such a
meaning. In fact the morpheme is used in a much more complex way, i.e. for tempo-
ral ordering of events in combined clauses. Even though the morpheme can also be
attached to a predicate not directly related to another in one sentence, the event is
related to the context in general. It means that something was done before the time of
utterance. Therefore it can mean something like ‘before’ in clause relations. The
clauses may also be coordinated with the connector ač ‘and’ in addition (112). Here
are two examples of the use of -wana in clause combining:

When the event has not happened yet, as for example in a command, the mor-
pheme -wana ‘DEP’ can be attached to the first one of two events. This is the case in
the following example:
(113) kew pihinoewanap piyonopa.

A complement clause has been defined as “a clause that functions as an argument
(subject or object) of some other clause” by Payne (1997:313; on the base of Noonan
1985:42). This is a very general statement. In 10.2 I have shown how relative clauses
are generally NPs that can also function as subjects or objects in a clause (in the case
of headless RCs). The specific character of verb–complement constructions in Baure
is manifested by a main verb which has a verb complement. The matrix clause that
contains the main verb may in other languages be dependent on the complement
clause, but in Baure every matrix verb can also occur on its own. The complement
clause is always embedded in the matrix clause. Payne further argues that “[t]ypical
matrix verbs for finite complements are verbs of utterance and cognition” (Payne
1997:314). In Baure, matrix verbs are verbs of utterance and cognition, but also verbs
of motion, perception, temporal verbs, and many others. Non-verbal predicates also
function as matrix predicates, e.g. henokowor ‘it is good (that)’. In Chapter 7 free
verbal particles are described and apparently some of these particles are directly de-
rived from verbs. The development of these particles can be understood as a further
grammaticalization of verb–complement constructions.
    One type of complements is added unmarked, another type of complements has to
be marked by the action nominalizer -čo ‘NOM2’ for subordination, which is also
used for relative clauses (10.2.2). In principle there is not a real difference between
relative clauses that are constructed with this nominalizer and marked complement
clauses, but because of the different semantic interpretation this clause type is re-
peated here. In comparison we can recall the complement clauses marked by a con-
nector, mainly apo ‘if, that’ (10.1.9). This type of complement clauses will not be
taken into account again in this section.

The predicates that take subject or object complements, referred to by Noonan
(1985:42–43) as “complement-taking predicates”, in Baure take an unmarked com-
plement. These predicates constitute a closed class. The predicates that have a com-
plement but do not belong to the defined class of the typically complement-taking
predicates always have a marked subordinated predicate complement. The comple-
ment may in both cases also be marked by the complementizer apo ‘if, that’ and oth-
ers, as has already been discussed (10.1.9). The following sections will illustrate the
closed class of complement-taking predicates (10.3.5) in Table 10.3, and then move
on to the description of marked complementation (10.3.6).","[440, 441, 442]"
"8.1.1. Place adverbs
Place adverbs form a small closed class. All the elements are morphologically sim-
ple, but some of the stems can be reduplicated. Place adverbs can never be preceded
by a determiner. Their position in the clause is relatively free, but most frequently
they are part of the predicate phrase and precede the locative argument marked by -ye
‘LOC’. Examples (1) through (4) demonstrate the possible positioning of the adverb
noiy ‘there’. The same possibilities exist for the other place adverbs in Table 8.1.

       ‘There where she was making patasca she said: …’                   [GP-N1/II-22]
In (1) noiy ‘there’ directly follows the verb, whereas in (2) it follows the argument of
the non-verbal predicate kwe’ ‘exist’. On the other hand, in (3) the place adverb pre-
cedes the predicate kwe’ ‘exist’, directly following the clause-initial connector tiwe’
‘but’, and in (4) its position is completely clause-initial. In (2) noiy also precedes a
locative argument, which specifies the location and is marked by -ye ‘LOC’. This is
the most frequent use of the place adverb: followed by a more specific location, ei-
ther an NP marked by locative -ye or a subordinate clause, such as the cleft construc-
tion tiow noiy ‘this is where’ (cf. 10.2.7).
    Furthermore, a few place adverbs can be inserted between a preverbal particle and
the verb, as in (5):
(5)     ver noiy rokomiračow-hi.
        ver    noiy ro=komiračo-wo=hi
        PERF there 3SGm=meet-COP=QUOT
        ‘Then he met (him) there.’                                              [RP-N6-36]
The basic forms of the place adverbs can be divided into three different distances –
ne’ ‘here’, noiy ‘there’, and naka ‘over there (far away)’ – which can be compared to
the three different demonstrative pronouns. The further analysis of these place ad-
verbs and the probably related demonstratives is beyond the scope of this grammar.
There is also another adverb meaning ‘there’: nan, and it remains difficult to under-
stand the difference of nan and noiy. It seems as if nan can mean that something is
‘not here’, maybe absent. The adverb nan has also only been found with stative verbs
or predicates, which may be important.
    The distal adverb naka’ ‘over there’ generally refers to some place in a non-
visible far distance that someone still has to approach. The possible relation to the
demonstrative pronouns is suggested in Table 8.1, in which all four place adverbs are
represented: spatial relevance                   form          possible transla- related demonstrative?

 used in contrast to ‘here’, nan                   there              ten/tin/to nen? ‘DEM3’
 stative, generic?, absent?
Table 8.1: Place adverbs in Baure (in comparison to demonstratives)
CHAPTER 8 - CLOSED WORD CLASSES                                                                               303
The relation to the demonstratives is not completely clear. I suspect a formal rela-
tion195 between nan and ten/tin, even though the term “distal”, applied to naka’ ‘over
there’ is also used with ten/tin/to nen ‘DEM3’.
    The adverb naka’ can be found in two derived forms, as nakon and nakoš. nakon
seems to have been derived by attaching the nominalizer -no ‘NOM1’ to it, and it is
used in many imperative clauses, in which predicates are generally nominalized (cf.
9.3). Therefore it can be assumed that in an imperative clause this adverb may be
marked as well. Observe example (6):
(6)        kewon nakon!
           ke-wo-no               nak-no
           EV-COP-NOM1            there-NOM1
           ‘Come here!’                                                                  [DC-16/3/06-39]
Example (6) shows that nakon (but also naka) can also refer to a large distance in a
dynamic sense, because it can mean ‘from there’, in other cases ‘to there’; the inter-
pretation of each clause depends on the verb. The use and etymology of nakoš is un-
clear. There are only very few examples, and the speakers do not seem to make a
great difference between any of the distal adverbs in general196. The adverb naka can
also be reduplicated as nakaka, while noiy and ne’ are not reduplicated.
    None of the place adverbs are used in a temporal sense, but one temporal adverb
has been derived from a place adverb by means of reduplication: nanan ‘later’.
    Other more specific locative phrases consist of a noun marked by the locative
suffix -ye, which constitutes an oblique object in a clause (cf. 4.8 and 9.1.3). In gen-
eral, it is not possible to mark a place adverb with the locative -ye, but in one text
type I found an exception (7)197. In a song this rule was ignored and, instead of mark-
ing the noun (širinkasowoko ‘rubber plantation’), the adverb ne’ ‘here’ gets the loca-
tive suffix attached. This seems to have been a matter of metre in the line, related to
the emphasis on the adverb:
(7)        rokačow ne-ye širinkaswoko.
           ro-kačo-wo       ne-ye         širinkas-woko
           3SGm=go-COP here-LOC           rubber-plantation
           ‘He went away (here) to the rubber plantation.’                                        [JP-S2-3]
8.1.2. Temporal and aspectual adverbs
Time adverbs are numerous in Baure. They are used frequently, particularly because
Baure does not have any morphological way of absolute tense marking. A number of
time adverbs are monomorphemic, as listed in Table 8.2.","[323, 324, 325]"
