INTRODUCTION
Southern Sierra Miwok is a member of the Miwok family of languages of Central California. It belongs to the
Eastern division of Miwok, together with Central Sierra, Northern Sierra, Plains, and Saclan. The three Sierra
languages are more closely related to each other than to either Plains or Saclan. The internal relationships of
the Miwok family can perhaps be most clearly stated in a chart, as follows (Broadbent and Callaghan, 1960):A. Eastern Division        1. Sierra                  la. Southern Sierra
                  lb. Central Sierra

                  lb. Marin        2. LakeExcept for Saclan, added by Beeler (1955, 1959), the Eastern languages were named and geographically
defined by Barrett (1908). Previous suggestions on similar lines had been made by Kroeber (1906) and
Merriam (1907).","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"
"The fieldwork on which the present study is based was conducted under the auspices of the Survey of
California Indian Languages (Department of Linguistics, University of California, Berkeley) during the
following periods: August 24 to September 14, 1955; June 26 to September 10, 1956; June 28 to September 4,
1957; July 2 to September 7, 1958; and July 7 to July 28, 1961. My informants were as follows:        Chris Brown (Chief Leeme), of Bootjack (CB, deceased November 1956)

        Charlie Bohan, of Ahwahnee (CR)Chief Leeme (/limi•/, 'ripples on the water') was my principal informant during 1955 and 1956, and the
phonemic analysis is based largely on his idiolect. His mother, Lena Brown (nee Rube), was one of Freeland's
informants. He was born in Yosemite, and claimed the title of chief of the Yosemite band through inheritance
from his father, John Brown or Brandon. He and his brother Alvis claimed to be the only surviving speakers
of the Yosemite dialect. While working with me, he made some effort to give me forms as used around
Bootjack, a few miles south of Mariposa, where the work was being done, because more speakers of that
dialect remain. Sometimes, however, he said specifically that a particular form or pronunciation belonged to
the Yosemite dialect, and the features hereafter mentioned as possibly characteristic of Yosemite are based on
his comments. However, Chief Leeme was a ""professional Indian"" in a quite literal sense: he was employed
by the U. S. National Park Service to put on Indian dances for the edification of visitors to Yosemite National
Park. He clearly regarded such work as his true vocation, although he was no longer so employed when I
worked with him. He had a well-developed sense of showmanship, and did not feel constrained to restrict
himself to Yosemite or even Miwok features if he felt that the addition of something else would improve his
performance. Other informants claimed that in speaking Miwok he assumed a ""northern accent"" (""he spoke it
more like they do up Tuolumne way"") in order to make Yosemite speech sound different from that of
Mariposa, and that he ""belonged around El Portal"" rather than to the Yosemite band proper. These
considerations throw some doubt on the authenticity of his ""Yosemite dialect."" After his death, the material in
question could not be checked or expanded; even his brother Alvis, the last survivor of his family, then ceased
to be available for informant work. However, speakers of the Mariposa dialect recognized certain items as
being different in Yosemite speech, and it is clear that some differences did exist.","[11, 12]"

Dr. Sylvia M. Broadbent prepared this grammar and dictionary based on her research and her Ph.D.
dissertation, A Grammar of Southern Sierra Miwok, at the Department of Linguistics, University of
California, Berkeley. She also wrote Central Sierra Miwok Dictionary in 1960. She received a B.A. and Ph.D.
in Anthropology from Berkeley in 1952 and 1960. Dr. Broadbent is Professor Emerita at University of
California Riverside. Her areas of interest are archaeology and ethnohistory of the Andean area, especially the
Chibcha of Columbia; and North American Indians, especially California and the Desert West. She has also
undertaken studies in descriptive and historical linguistics, especially American Indian languages and in
language and culture, including relationships between linguistic findings and other kinds of anthropological
research, and symbolism.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"

                                           (Told by Castro Johnson)(1) And this is a different one, we're telling about cowboys. (2) Every Sunday we used to go from here, from
Mariposa, maybe twenty-five [of us]. (3) And at Princeton we got maybe ten or twelve. (4) And then some
from Bear Valley used to come, maybe fifteen. (5) Maybe about eight or ten used to come from Hornitos. (6)
We all used to meet here. (7) Then all these cowboys here used to chase wild horses. (8) Every Sunday we
used to go there to go chasing. (9) Sometimes we didn't get any. (10) Then the last time we got some, maybe
fifteen. (11) This mule, then, we all put him there, we brought him to Princeton and put him in the corral. (12)
Then we said to one man, a young man, ""Ride him!"" (13) ""All right,"" he said, ""Put up five dollars and I’ll ride
him,"" he said. (14) So five dollars came in. (15) Then he got on that mule. (16) The mule didn't do anything,
he didn't jump, just as if he had already been ridden, (17) running back and forth as if he were following his
friends around. (18) Then, ""Get off that no-good old mule!"" they said. (19) He got off and took off his saddle.
(20) Then one man from Hornitos bought it for five dollars and took it down there to his ranch. He put him
inside, gave him barley to eat, and put water for him. (21) That mule just stood there, (22) I don't know how
long he stood there, he didn't eat anything. (23) Little by little he was starving to death. (24) He knelt down on
his front feet, he got tired. (25) He stayed that way a long time, who knows how long. (26) Next, gradually, he
went down with his hind feet too, and lay there on his stomach. (27) Then after doing that he lay down. (28)
He lay down then and stayed who knows how long, a long time. (29) Then, after lying down like that, next he
closed his eyes. (30) Then he died. (31) That's all.","[461, 462, 463, 464]"
"(55) They got there, he carried her in his arms. (56) ""You see, you wanted to come with me. Do you think I
am going to a good place? I'm going to a different world, where I walk is not good. (57) I'm going to my
enemy, to where they killed my father. I'm going to challenge him to play football. (58) I want him to play
ball and kick his ball the other way, so that he can't kick it away. (59) In the same place I am going to kick
him around and kill him, he won't recover. (60) We are going to that different world where my people live,
my uncle. (61) You will sleep with my uncle, and I will sleep with my aunt."" (62) Then he could not see, he
has to listen to everything. At night they talked, they whispered. (63) His uncle told the Duck, ""This is what
was done to his father. He was kicked to the south, from the south they brought him back north. (64) They
went west, he came east. (65) The ball got there and came out this side of the track. (66) He kicked him all
around and killed him. (67) In the same place he roasted him, he cremated him, your father-in-law. They
cremated him in the same hole."" (68) Then also, Mole is sleeping with his aunt, they are whispering to each
other. ""That's what he did,"" she said. (69) ""He treated your father badly, your enemy. He ill-treated him. He
did that after he ill-treated him. (70) He is doing the same thing now to your husband. He will treat him
badly,"" he [?] said. (71) Then they went. In the morning he challenged him. (72) At night, the other, ""What's
going on? What are they talking about? Hey, who is he talking to?"" he said, (73) he was told that one from
both sides. The next day he went. ""I have come here. (74) I am going to challenge you with this ball that we
are kicking. (75) You won all my father's things, his food, everything he had hidden, their abalone shells, his
olive shells, his clothes, you won the beads. (76) Here are mine ready."" ""You are doing the

EL: (40) Young [limbs] are picked, I don't know what month they pick them, in the wintertime when there
aren't any leaves.
RW: (41) Then what is done next, it's peeled?
EL: (42) Yes, it's peeled with a small knife, it's skinned, this thing-umibob; ts skin, that's what I mean, it
comes off, just the white part is saved, the little ones, little tree shoots, that's made into the main part of the
cradle, the shade part, everything; you make the sunshade with that.
RW: (43) First the big ones are picked, to make this little bed, this cradle, isn't that right.
EL: (44) Yes, it's all one size. And then, and this, it can be made if desired, and it can be made of this
thingummy, whatever it is cooking—baskets are made of—of roots, and then, and this, and you skin the
what's it, something or other, little white oak sprouts.
RW: (45) That's another kind of tree, that the Indians used for making [baskets] long ago.
EL: (46) Yes.
RW: (47) And then, and then it is made into the little bed, it's twined, isn't it.
EL: (48) It's twined with that.
RW: (49) It's done first.
EL: (50) With that.
RW: (51) And then, they used to make it, lengthening it, making the sunshade last.
EL: (52) It was made last.
RW: (53) From its little foot.
EL: (54) It's started from its little foot.
RW: (55) Its shade is made.
EL: (56) The shade, right here, its sunshade.
RW: (57) Then it will be decorated, it will be made pretty.
EL: (58) One will decorate it with that, with little things, with little pretty things, with little colored things,
this something, with fine yarn.
RW: (59) They are different, it seems like, for a little boy, the design for the sunshade, isn't it.
EL: (60) Yes, there are several different kinds.
RW: (61) But a different kind for girls.
EL: (62) Yes, it's different too; that's how the makers do it.
RW: (63) Now not at all any more, they don't do that, it isn't done that way for babies now, it seems like they
quit using this cradle basket.
EL: (64) Yes, everybody threw it away recently, maybe soon nobody will make them any more, it's forgotten.","[404, 405, 406, 407]"

                                            (Told by Castro Johnson)(1) And this is a different one that this one and I are telling, the girl sitting here and I. (2) Once the alligator
saw this jackrabbit sitting on the other side on the bare ground, there was no grass for him to eat, he was
hungry. (3) Then this one told him, ""Why don't you go to the other side here? You see they have plenty to
eat,"" he said. (4) ""But you know I can't swim,"" said the jackrabbit. (5) ""Oh, climb on my back, let me take
you,"" he said. (6) ""Oh, you mean you want to eat me, that's all that is,"" he said. (7) ""Oh, but I don't want to eat
you, you poor thin thing."" (8) ""It doesn't matter if I am thin, just the same in the middle you’ll want to eat me,""
he said. (9) ""Oh, I couldn't do that,"" he said. (10) ""Oh, all right."" (11) So he took him to the other side,
swimming with him. (12) He stopped close to a willow, a young willow, at maybe three feet or so, so that he
couldn't reach to jump across to the ground. (13) There he asked the horse who came. (14) Then he asked the
horse, ""I see you have plenty to eat here,"" he said to the horse. (15) ""Yes, there's plenty to eat. (16) Long ago
when I was young, I used to be fed, I used to have a bed prepared for me, I used to have a blanket put on me at
night, I used to be given water, I used to be brushed, I always stayed indoors. The next day I used to be fed
again. (17) Now that I've grown old, there's nothing. At night I don't sleep, I'm standing all night long, when
it's raining like this there's nowhere, how can you lie down, it's not dry. You have to stand around, just
because I'm so old. (18) When I was young they used to shoe me when I needed it, they used to look at the
shoes. (19) Now that I'm old I am left outside. (20) Good-bye,"" he said, (21) and went. (22) Then this bull
came. He did the same thing, he asked him again. ""You have plenty of food here,"" he said. (23) ""Yes,"" said
[the bull]. (24) He asked him the same thing again. (25) ""Yes, when I was young I used to be fed. Now that
I'm old they don't want to see me,"" he said. (26) ""I'm standing up all night long, there's nowhere that I can lie
down,"" he said again. (27) Then along came that fox; he was trying to get this jackrabbit to jump. (28) The
jackrabbit was afraid to jump, he could not jump onto the ground that way. (29) Then the bull said, ""That's all;
goodbye,"" (30) and left. (31) Then the jackrabbit looked and looked, and finally jumped. (32) That's all; he
jumped into that willow. (33) He just barely made it. He went; he crossed over. (34) The alligator really
wanted to eat him, but he

"The three Sierra Miwok languages are structurally very similar. The principal differences between them are
phonetic, especially in the spirant series, and lexical. Speakers of Southern Sierra claim that they cannot
understand Central or Northern. As Barrett suggested in 1908, there are some dialect differences within
Southern Sierra. At this late date, very little can be determined as to the nature of these differences, since so
few speakers remain. However, there was clearly some divergence between the speech of individuals from
Yosemite, those from the vicinity of Mariposa, and those from the extreme southern limit of Miwok territory.
Occasional lexical items are different, and Yosemite speech may have had an additional spirant phoneme, /s./,
which is lacking in the others. Spanish loan-words sometimes occur in differing forms in these three areas.
Speakers from Mariposa say that they can hardly understand those from Yosemite, only forty miles away.",[11]
"There are now only about twenty more or less fluent speakers of Southern Sierra, none below middle age.
Only four individuals are known to use the language commonly in daily conversation. It seems probable that
by 1980 the language will be extinct, except for stray words remembered by people who never spoke the
language fluently.",[11]
"Informants living today know very little about the ancient boundaries of their language. One informant placed
the western limit on a line running through Merced Falls, Hornitos, Toledo, and Indian Gulch, a few miles
east of Kroeber's boundary. He gave Ahwahnee as the southeast limit. All informants were more or less sure
that the village of /?apa•ša?/ or /?apa•šaw/ near Oakhurst was Yokuts, in agreement with Kroeber (1923, p.
482: ""Hapasau""). However, one individual spoke of a village called /hicwe•ta?/. about three miles west of
Oakhurst, as having both Yokuts and Miwok inhabitants, and said that there were some Miwok at Coarsegold,
which is assigned by Kroeber to Yokuts territory. Since the Miwok do not appear to have recognized anyDICTIONARY                                                                                                     8

political entities larger than the village or local group, a certain haziness about boundaries is understandable.
Moreover, they seem to have been on good terms with their Chuckchansi (Yokuts) neighbors at least, and
there was probably considerable intermarriage between villages near the limits of their respective linguistic
groups. Such villages would naturally contain speakers of both languages.","[10, 11]"

                                            (Told by Castro Johnson)(1) And now we are telling a different story; this girl is sitting listening. (2) Long ago, this ?ywel•in was
finishing off the people. He carried them off all the time, he used to kill them all and finish them off. (3) Then
he raised two little children, he brought them up. (4) Then those children used to play with the skulls of their
mother and their relatives, they used to roll them. (5) They would roll them to the bottom from on top over a
flat, sloping rock, then they would get them and take them back on top. (6) They used to do that every day, the
two little ones kept on playing. (7) Then one Coyote went to visit them and saw them. He stayed there who
knows how long. (8) He watched which way [?ywel•in] went, where he came out. (9) ""Goodbye,"" he said.
(10) ""Yes,"" he said; ""I’ll take care of the children here,"" he said. (11) He asked the children, ""Where does your
grandfather come out?"" (12) ""Right there he’ll always come out; he comes out there all the time,"" said the
children. (13) In the evening, then he came, (14) and they ate supper. But [Coyote] cooked this meat that he
had put in the bottom of the pack basket and ate it himself, he ate this jackrabbit hidden here in his pack
basket. (15) Then it was night, and they went to sleep. When [?ywel•in] was snoring hard, [Coyote] looked for
where his heart was. (16) Then he found it in the middle of his foot. (17) Then he stretched his feet out. When
he stretched out his legs, this is the way he went when [Coyote] touched him in the middle of his foot: ""Grunt,
grunt, grunt,"" he said. (18) Then, ""Oh, it's right there, your heart,"" [Coyote] said. (19) He went to sleep again.
(20) He did the same thing again, he stretched out, stretched himself out. Right in the middle of his foot, in the
middle of it, he did the same thing that way. ""Grunt, grunt, grunt,"" he said. (21) ""Oh, it's right there,"" said this
Coyote. (22) He went to sleep. They got up the next day, (23) and he went out the next day again. (24) Just the
same when he came back he came out in exactly the same place again. (25) [Coyote] was watching carefully
whether he would come out in the same or a different place. (26) He didn't come out any other place, only in

it?"" they said; (62) ""Our eyes are no good. (63) Look for it yourselves, you who have good eyes,"" they said.

"The historic territory of Southern Sierra was roughly equivalent to modern Mariposa County. Kroeber (1923,
facing p. 446) shows it as more or less triangular in shape. He places the boundary with Central Sierra
between the Merced and Tuolumne Rivers. To the south, he draws the Yokuts-Mono boundary along the
Fresno River, continuing the line northeastwards between the watersheds of the Merced and San Joaquin
Rivers up to the crest of the Sierra Nevada, the eastern limit of all the Sierra Miwok groups. He places the
western boundary, with Yokuts groups, at the beginning of the foothills.",[10]

                                             (Told by Chris Brown)(1) Long ago Coyote was in the tules. (2) He went to sleep there in the tules. (3) But a certain one called
Mosquito came up to him and talked about this sky above him. (4) ""Mmmmmm,"" he said singing, the
Mosquito. (5) But that one, Coyote, hit himself on the face when something landed on him, but he hit only
himself and bothered himself, (6) so he gave up. ""What can I do about this? Maybe if I go to this open country
there won't be any mosquitoes there."" (7) He came along the rocks and his feet just wore out. His old feet
were bleeding. (8) ""Ay!"" he said, ""Ay!"" With nothing to eat he grew hungry and thin. (9) ""Now, when I see
something to eat somewhere, I'm going to kill him and eat him,"" he said. (10) He went towards the east. For
days and days he did not find anything to eat anywhere, and he could not do anything for himself; (11) his
foot hurt, he could not chase anything. (12) He looked forward to eating a jack-rabbit, but he could not catch
up with it. (13) He cried over his feet and was sad. (14) Then he got to a little creek, as he kept on traveling,
and he saw a Crane standing up to his waist in the water, watching for trout to eat. (15) ""Hey, now I’ll eat,"" he
said, filled with anticipation when he saw this big one far off. (16) ""I’ll keep wandering on,"" he said. (17)
Then he came up to him. (18) ""Let me come up to him, let me talk to him, just wait,"" he said. (19) He got
there. (20) ""Hey, what are you doing so hard, you very big one here in the water, looking?"" he said. (21) ""I'm
looking at this one under you, so that the sky won't turn over on us. (22) If I don't do this, if I don't watch it, if
it falls it will kill all of us, (23) so I'm watching this water here. (24) When it gets worse, I'm going to run
around and go and tell the people. 'Move away! The sky is coming down on us,' is what I’ll say."" (25) Then,

now. (27) Let me stand here, and you go and find me some food somewhere, I'm hungry."" (28) ""All right,"" he
said, but the Crane knew what he wanted to eat. (29) He saw some mushrooms, and his old belly was empty.
(30) So he kept standing there in the water holding the water down. (31) Then [Coyote] went on and further
down he arrived at a tree, and that certain one climbed it, another hunter of fish. He got there, (32) and just
watched him. (33) ""What are you doing? What is he looking down for?"" he said. (34) Then he asked, ""What
are you people doing in the creek? You are peering at the same thing under you in the water,"" he said. (35)
""This sky is going to fall, and we are here watching for something bad to arrive,"" he said. (36) ""We will tell
the people about it before he comes. (37) That's our job. (38) I'm the one who peers over from high up, I can
see a long way from here,"" he said. (39) ""But I am very hungry. Can I do something for you while you go and
get me something to eat? Maybe if you give me a little food, maybe I can survive, but I ought to help you,""
(40) and he climbed the tree, that one went, he ran perhaps to get some food. (41) He got up there and fell
down. He got to the ground at the bottom and climbed again. (42) ""I'm going to try again,"" he said. (43) He
got to the same place halfway up again, it broke and he fell. (44) That Coyote, being hungry, could not hold
himself, he could not do anything. (45) ""What am I going to do? Maybe I won't come out,"" he said. (46) [The
bird] looked at the water from halfway up the tree. (47) ""Maybe they are telling me the truth,"" he said. ""These
ripples in the water, maybe that's the truth. (48) I’ll just ask for food."" (49) That one went. After he went, after
he ran away, after looking and looking, Coyote said, ""Maybe he is telling me a lie in what he said to me."" (50)
He went on quietly. When he heard the leaves talking, (51) he ran back, he went to climb the tree and peep
out. ""He didn't do anything yet,"" he said. (52) He went on. The leaves talked. (53) When the leaves talked he
ran and returned to them. Little by little he went further and further till he got there, where one was standing
in the water. (54) ""I'm going to eat that one no matter what happens, I don't care what he does to me, I'm
going to eat him. I'm very hungry, I'm getting thin,"" he said. (55) He got there. ""What are you doing here?
You are jumping so much on these rocks and bouncing around. What are you going to do there under the
water? What are you peering around at from there? There, what is it that you are kicking so much underneath
all the time?"" (56) ""Oh, I have

don't want it to come out on top. I'm holding it down. Once in a while I go below. I go to bounce all the way
to that rock, (58) then I go under the water, going to look to see if everything in the world is all right under the
water. (59) Then I come again, kicking these rocks, kicking them down because I don't want them to come
up."" (60) Then again he was thinking, ""Maybe it's true that it's going to fall. I've got to do something. I’ll say
that I'm going to look, I'm going to walk around under the water looking at everything. I can't do anything, I
am so hungry. I would help you, you are very small and very light to do that, to hold those rocks down. (61)
But I am heavy, I am a big person,"" he said. (62) So then, ""If you do that, if you help me, maybe I can go and
get some food for the starving ones. Where can I go to find it?"" (63) So then, ""Yes, please do that, I'm dying
of hunger, dying of hunger. I can't do anything."" (64) ""All right, I'm going. Maybe I’ll have to get food, it's all
gone here. I’ll go and get it and bring it, and later let me feed you with it, if you do that, if you take care of
these rocks for me. (65) You will jump to this one from here, all the way to the rock, and from that rock to
here again, you will dance around again. You will dance all the way over again, talking, saying ""Ee! Ee!,"" you
will talk and talk, if you jump on the rocks, if you dance. (66) Then if you stay longer, you will go there under
the water, going to look for this thing, if it does that to you, if the earth cracks on you, say."" (67) So he went,
he flew down below, to look for that food. (68) But this kept on going and told them there below, he told
some of them there, ""This thing, this big one, he's going to eat us. Maybe he's an ogre,"" he said as he went.
""Look out for yourselves, watch for him to come out, he will come out here. Try hard to be good to him, all of
you,"" he said. (69) Then all the little birds thought, ""Maybe that's true, he's getting rid of us, that one, he's
going to eat us and get rid of us people here,"" they said. (70) So he bounced around and looked forward to
[getting food]. He was so proud that he put on his flicker-feather headband, and with his costume he arrived
there and danced on top of the rocks. Being vain, he tried to keep up, that Coyote bounced around and
bounced around. (71) ""I'm going to peer at this country, at what's wrong here under the water. Maybe we
might fall down,"" he said. (72) ""I'm going anyhow, I'm going now here under the water, I'm going to arrive
somewhere, I’ll reach it,"" he just said. ""I'm going a long way. (73) But that one is thinking, that tiny one, the
little bird, he's not going far on top of the water, he's going to look,"" he said. (74) So high on

fell down there and broke his nose and blacked his eyes. (75) ""Maybe something did it to you when I landed
on it,"" he said when he came out. He clutched himself, but he danced just the same holding his hand; he
danced just the same, singing. He was proud of the costumes and things that he hid and put on, (76) saying,
""Maybe he can help me."" Then, ""I'm going to try again,"" he said, as his head got better and was not cut. (77)
""Maybe I'd better try again, maybe I can go to find it, maybe it can do something,"" he said. (78) He jumped
and went high up again, and came down. (79) Arriving at the bottom, he burrowed under the sand and rocks
and everything, starving [?]. ""What is he doing, maybe they treat me badly, poor old me,"" he said. (80) ""It
seems that I was treated badly, I was treated even worse. I'd better go, I'm only getting more hungry here
doing this, I am only keeping on playing with these rocks, and washing my hair in the water. Maybe I'd better
not stay very long, maybe I’ll get to something,"" he said seeing that one, (81) who had not gone far. (82) ""I'm
going."" (83) He went up the hillside. (84) From the hill he jumped in the water again. (85) He landed head
first and was more cut up. (86) He went over there again, and hearing something he ran. (87) ""Let them be
careless, let them die,"" he said, getting angry with those people. He went west. (88) ""I'm going there now just
the same, I don't care if I die on the road,"" he said. (89) ""I'm very tired from hunger. (90) Now they aren't
going to do that to me, they aren't going to treat me badly. (91) Now if I see any of those birds I eat him, I
swallow him, I don't care whether the world comes down or not,"" he said. (92) He went to the west, he did not
see anything, he went a long way. (93) ""What can I do? Where can I go?"" he said. (94) ""I’ll go over the land,
but this water looks bad to me,"" he said. (95) He went over the land. (96) He walked and walked through the
rocks. He came upon a certain Water Ouzel, (97) he came upon him there when he was shouting. ""It's
certainly a very little thing,"" he said, ""but what I'm going to do is eat him just the same. I don't care anyway,
let it fall down, all this rock below. (98) When I swallow him I am going to run, I'm going a long way off
again,"" he said. (99) ""Maybe they lied to me, it seems,"" he said. (100) The little one was running around
saying ""Ee! Ee!"" (101) He went in the holes in the rocks and came out the other side again. (102) ""What are

he’ll eat me,"" this one said. ""He’ll eat me."" (110) ""I'm going to eat, I'm hungry."" His eyes changed when he
spoke, he only looked up, he couldn't do anything, he just had his mouth open. ""Huh, huh, huh, huh,"" he just
kept on saying. (111) He got there, he caught him, he swallowed that little Ouzel, he ate him. (112) ""Ah, but
now I have eaten! I have eaten now! Oh, my belly feels better,"" he said. (113) He rubbed his belly. ""Oh, but I
have eaten now, oh, now I’ll come out of it, I can go far, anywhere,"" he said. (114) But this old one a little
later came out again, outside of him. (115) He shouted in front of him. ""How did he do that to me? Where did
he come out of me? He came out."" (116) He looked at his teeth, his teeth were all right. (117) ""I thought I
swallowed him,"" he said. (118) ""But now I'm going to fix you."" He caught him and swallowed that little bird,
holding his rectum. He put his hand over his rectum, but the bird came out through his claws, through his feet.
(119) He flew away and landed far off. (120) ""You are going to eat me, you want to treat me badly,"" he said.
(121) ""But you can't get me,"" he said. (122) ""Hey, I closed it off with this hand of mine,"" he said, ""But he
came out of me."" (123) Then that old Coyote went away, he went any old way, he went somewhere north, still
hungry. (124) That's all of that.","[485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500]"

                                           (Told by Castro Johnson)(1) And here's another story. (2) Two little old people went where they had lots of children, they went to
baptize them. (3) Then those godparents baptized them [lit., ""gave them a bath""] on Sunday. (4) Then at
sunset they went back and got home. (5) Then later they often went, the man with his children, to get food.
They stayed for about one week. (6) Then his wife also went to get food too, and they stayed for some time
again, for three or four days. (7) Then again just the children went, (8) and then they stayed as long as they
could. (9) Then again his wife went to get food, from their godfather and godmother. (10) Then again they
stayed maybe one week or so. (11) Then the man went and was told about it by his wife. ""You'd better tell
them about it, whoever is coming now, that this is the last time. We didn't go and baptize them to give them
all their food, just to help them out. (12) Now it looks as if we're going to be giving them all their food all
their lives. (13) When somebody comes now, tell them that's all, so that they will know that they aren't to
come,"" he said. (14) Then his wife told them, ""My husband just said to me that this is the last time,"" she said.
(15) So the man said ""All right,"" and returned from there. He went and reached home, and got angry. (16)
Then he told his wife in the evening, ""Fix me a lunch, and a shirt, and socks,"" he said. (17) ""What's the
matter?"" his wife said. (18) ""Oh, nothing."" ""What do you mean by that?"" she said. (19) But later when he was
asked again he told her, (20) ""Oh, they don't want us to go to get food,"" he said. (21) ""Where are you going?""
(22) ""I don't know where I'm going, (23) but I'm going in the morning, while it's still dark. Maybe I’ll go north
somewhere,"" he said. (24) He went early in the morning. He went there. (25) In the evening he met one
cowboy going south. (26) ""Hold it: Where is the town, tell me? How far?"" (27) ""You’ll never get to the town,""

(30) and went. (31) He looked all around the tree when he got there in the evening, as it was getting dark. (32)
""Oh, that's what he meant, about these who got killed."" (33) He climbed that tree. (34) After he climbed up
and straddled the tree he listened. ""Who can have arrived on me here?"" he was saying of the talking
underneath him. (35) Then they talked. (36) ""Yes, we just fixed this up, we dammed it up just now,"" they
were saying to each other. (37) ""Yes, after we worked for a long time, it looks as if we dammed up where the
water comes out,"" some of them were saying. (38) ""They’ll never open it up,"" they were saying. (39) ""Only by
prying it up with a crowbar,"" they said. (40) Then in the morning he climbed down and looked all around. (41)
""Who is walking here around me?"" he said. (42) ""I don't see anybody's tracks, only these dead people. (43)
Maybe they are the ones who were talking,"" he said. (44) Then he went to the town. (45) He walked and
walked, it was nearly lunchtime when he got there. (46) He asked for water to drink, but the woman [said],
""What is it? Where is the water for me to give you? The water has dried up,"" she said. (47) ""Oh, maybe I can
fix it,"" said the man; that was what he had been listening to. (48) ""All right, then,"" she said, (44) and the
woman took him then to the headquarters. (50) Then the soldiers fetched him and took him, (51) and their
boss said, ""Do you want anything, any men?"" he said. (52) ""No, all I need is a crowbar."" (53) So they gave
him the crowbar (54) and he went. He looked up. (55). ""Oh, this is what they were talking about last night,"" he
said. (56) He pried it up little by little. (57) Then he opened it a little, enough that then the water could push it
out. (58) Then the water pushed it, and carried this rock down. (59) Then he was carried on their shoulders,
(60) and he was given another hat, a new one, and shoes and clothes, he was given everything, his hair was
cut. (61) The next day he was taken back, he was taken to his house with a mule packed with all sorts of food.
(62) His wife almost didn't know him, she did not recognize him. (63) Then the ones who brought him went
back when he got home. (64) Then the one, his godfather [lit., ""his father who gave him a bath""], ""Where did
you get so rich fast?"" he said. (65) ""Oh, I got angry that you told us 'you can't get any food,' so I went away, I
had to do something then, so that we wouldn't starve like that. (66) I went, and met a certain cowboy going
south. (67) Then I went north, and I reached and climbed that tree that the cowboy told me about.","[470, 471, 472, 473, 474, 475, 476]"

"From 1957 on, my principal informants were Castro Johnson, Rose Watt, and Emma Lord. Mr. Johnson's
family always lived in Mariposa. His mother, who died in 1942, is said to have been a monolingual. He has
not spoken the language much since his mother died, and consequently feels a little rusty, so that he is hesitant
about starting to tell a long story in Miwok. Once started, however, he is fully capable of carrying on an
animated conversation or reciting a long text in the language. Mrs. Watt and Mrs. Lord are sisters, and live
together near Usona. Their father was Miwok, their mother Chuckchansi (Yokuts); they are both fluent
trilinguals. Between themselves they normally speak Miwok. They were born on the ranch where they now
live, and say that their father was from right there. The place where they live has an Indian name, /piliwni?/.
Less than a hundred yards from their ranch house there is a large archaeological site (4-Mrp-249). Brief
surface reconnaisances of this site yielded one historic artifact (a glazed potsherd, probably of Chinese origin),
and several projectile points of the most recent type known for the area. The owners report finding glass beads
there. The surface of the site is therefore presumably historic, and it seems reasonable to assume that it
represents the Miwok village of /piliwni?/, and that Mrs. Watt's and Mrs. Lord's father's family lived there. It
is less than 20 miles from Yokuts territory.",[12]
"No exhaustive ethnography of the Miwok has ever appeared. Perhaps the most useful single work is Barrett
and Gifford's study of Miwok material culture (1933). Kroeber (1923, pp. 442-461) gives a good genera
summary of Miwok culture. It was among the Sierra Miwok that the exogamous moiety system was first
discovered in California (Gifford, 1916). In addition, some studies of Miwok mythology have appeared
(Barrett, 1919; de Angulo and Freeland, 1928; Gifford, 1917).",[11]

"Kroeber (1923, p. 445) suggests 9,000 as a liberal estimate for the population of the Sierra and Plains groups
combined, allowing slightly more than 2,000 for each group. He states, however, that there is no specific
information on aboriginal population figures. He lists 109 locateable Eastern Miwok villages. A total
population of 9,000 would give an average population of only 82.5 persons for the villages listed, and his
village list is obviously incomplete, since it includes only those which he could locate. The addition of more
villages, while accepting his total estimate, would lower the average village population still further. It seems
likely, then, that 9,000 is none too generous an estimate.",[11]

"The best previous work on these languages is Freeland's grammar (1951). It is based primarily on Central
Sierra, but includes references to structural differences between Central, Northern, and Southern. It is a good
and reasonably complete grammar; in fact, it is one of the best in print on any California language. However,
it was written fifteen year: before it was published, and is somewhat outdated in certain respects, especially
with regard to phonology. Some sample texts were included, but there was no dictionary; for Central Sierra,
this deficiency has since been filled, with the addition of more texts (Freeland and Broadbent, 1960).
Although these works provide adequate coverage of Central Sierra, separate treatment of the other Sierra
languages is still highly desirable the more so in view of the advances in techniques of linguistic analysis that
have taken place since Freeland's grammar was written.",[11]

                                            (Told by Castro Johnson)(1) And here's a different one. (2) Long ago the Indians used to go to the west to get horses, to steal them.
When they came back, they stole them and used to bring the horses of these Mexicans. (3) Then they were
chased and tracked up these mountains. (4) Then two old men were reached by these Mexicans, who made
war on them and kept on shooting at them. They shot one old man's bowstring. (5) But then he dodged
around, it didn't matter that his bowstring was shot off. They kept on shouting for their comrades, yelling. (6)
Then their comrades saw them from on top of the mountain. They ran down and chased them. They fought
each other back and forth. (7) Then these Mexicans got scared and went west, they went home. (8) Then one
man chased them, up the hill and up the hill they went. Way up on top he got to them. (9) But nobody at all
got killed. (10) Then they went back, these Mexicans, to their houses there in the west. (11) But they didn't get
any of the horses, they didn't take them back. (12) All of their horses were killed and made into meat. (13) So!
That's all.","[455, 456, 457, 458]"

                                              (Told by Chris Brown)(1) Long ago they say Tenaya talked about this, when the white people pushed him. (2) He arrived
somewhere, he went to Tenaya Lake (3) and coming back he arrived. The white soldier found him, clubbed
him and nearly killed him. (4) They brought him this way, they took him to the west, to what the white men
call Oakhurst (who knows the Indians' name). (5) There they had nothing to eat for several days. They just lay
there. They cracked acorns. (6) After they got the acorns, they ate them. The meat and things that the white
people gave them they threw away. (7) ""They are killing us,"" they said. (8) They took Tenaya himself to the
San Joaquin Valley. (9) Then at night he felt sorry for himself. (10) The soldier killed his child. ""I'm thinking
about my child, about going back to him, to see him and take care of him,"" he said. (11) Then at night he told
the Indians, ""It is said that if we don't go with these white people they will kill us and get rid of all of us. (12)
All of you go with these white people, but I am going to take care of my child, to see how he is there, I am
going to bury him and burn him,"" he said. (13) He ran from there this way. (14) Lebrado, or somebody, maybe
he, he was a little boy, he talked to me and told me that in answer, he told me at night. He came along the
creek, they waded the creek this way. (15) Everybody came. (16) The soldiers got there the next day, the
Indians had gone and run away. (17) But the soldier thinks, ""They are tired, let them rest. They have nothing
to eat,"" he said. (18) ""They won't go anywhere,"" said he, this one, what was his name, his captain. (19) Then
they came this way. They went along the creek, they climbed up to what they now call Bridal Veil. (20) Then
below he reached where the bear ate his child, dragging him around. (21) ""He didn't keep very well,"" he
thought. He took his child (22) and brought him to Bear Creek, as they call it, and buried it there, his bones.
(23) He himself died too, he was killed on the other side of the mountains by the Monos. They clubbed him.
(24) After they clubbed him and killed him they laid him out. (25) John Hutchins, whom we call Tom
Hutchins, he brought him, nothing but his hair, he brought it to the Indians. The Indians wept, they cried all
one night. (26) The next day they buried him there in Yosemite, at what is called the Museum. He was buried
there, his dust, as they say. (27) Then the Indians, ""They are different, they are another kind of people, it is
said,"" they thought. ""That's right,"" they said.","[518, 519, 520, 521]"

the bears. (5) Then the bear cubs went in. (6) ""You'd better say 'maa-maa-maa,'"" they said. (7) Then they went
