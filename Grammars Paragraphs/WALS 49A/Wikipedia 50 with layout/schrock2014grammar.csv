Ik employs eight cases to encode grammatical relations between verbs and
their arguments, or between arguments and modifiers (genitive). In König’s
African case typology, Ik is a Type 2 split-accusative system in which both the
nominative and accusative cases are marked (2008:10). It is ‘accusative’ in
that when core clausal arguments are marked differently from each other, S
and A take the nominative case, while O takes the accusative case. And it is
‘split’ in that this accusativity only occurs when the subject (A) is third
person. The objects (O) of first and second person subjects (A/S) take the
nominative case. And when a subject (A/S) is preposed before the verb, for
example in most types of subordinate clauses, it also takes the accusative.
(2)      1/2 person subjects             3 person subjects

Blake defines case as a typical system of “marking the relationship of a noun
to a verb at the clause level or of a noun to a preposition, postposition or
another noun at the phrase level” (1994:1). True to this definition, Ik case
encodes the grammatical relations between a verb and its core arguments
and any non-core arguments. And though in Ik the genitive case can mark
arguments for some verbs, its main function is to mark the relationship
between a noun phrase and a possessive nominal modifier.","[264, 265]"
"
In some instances, though, a noun in another case other than the oblique
can be found after ńꜜda. This happens when a verb ‘sees through’ ńꜜda to
assign a case role. In the following example, the verb eɡini assigns the dative
case to mark its conjoined complex indirect object (with a Goal role):
(55)    Egini guritinie nda ŋatametaak.
        eɡ-ini    ɡúr-ítíní-e         ńꜜda         ŋátámɛtaá-kᵉ
        put-SEQ heart- PL-DAT         and          thoughts-DAT
        And they put (it) in their hearts and thoughts.

6.3.2 Nominative
The nominative case suffix {-a} has engendered more than its share of
confusion in the descriptive literature. Referring to this morpheme, Heine &
König state that “Like Crazzolara, we consider the ‘complemental suffix’ to
be a functionally empty appendage of nouns…in their unmarked form.
Accordingly, it is interpreted as a morphologically redundant ending…”
(1996:137). Later, the segmental similarity between the nominative {-a}
and the accusative {-(k)a} led to the following comment (König 2008:73):
        “The final vowel -a has a unique value in the system. All words or
        particles of the language end by default in the vowel -a, and so are
        nominative and accusative case forms (in the non-final form). It
        remains unclear whether the - a of the nominative and accusative is
        triggered by the general rule of the language to use vowel -a as a
        default ending of each word or whether -a has the value of an
        independent case suffix encoding nominative or accusative.”","[283, 284]"
"
A complex sentence like this one embodies the language’s full-fledged
morphological case-marking system. In addition to word order and
connectives like ńda ‘with’, Ik uses this case system to mark grammatical
relations and encode semantic roles in an integral and efficient manner.
232
6.1     Case overview
        “The case marking typology of a language is surely its most central
        typological parameter, since almost all other parts of the grammar
        must interact with it.”—Talmy Givón, quoted by Serzisko (1992:50)
All Ik nominals must be inflected for case, and formal parallels of nominal
case markers are found in other diverse parts of the grammar. Due to its
grammatical centrality, the Ik case system has already been the subject of
several works (e.g. Heine 1990, König 2002, König 2008, and Schrock
2014). As König defines it, “a case system is an inflexional system of
marking nouns or noun phrases for the type of relationship they bear to
their heads… expressed by affixes, tone, accent shift, or root reduction…”
(2008:5). Out of the above list, Ik uses a combination of affixes and stem
reduction to encode case relations. The affixes are suffixes, and stem
reduction means the stem-final vowel is deleted before some case suffixes.","[263, 264]"
"
In terms of areal parallels for the Ik case system, the closest place to look is
Teso-Turkana. Dimmendaal’s description of the Turkana case system reveals
a few similarities with Ik but also substantial differences (1983:66-67). With
six cases (absolutive, nominative, genitive, instrumental, locative, and
vocative), Turkana has almost as many as Ik. But a crucial difference is that
Turkana cases are marked with tone rather than affixes. Also, while Ik is
both a marked nominative and marked accusative language, Turkana is only
a marked nominative language: Direct objects, indirect objects, and a noun’s
citation form are all unmarked as absolutive. But post-verbal clauses
subjects take the tonally marked nominative case. So if Teso-Turkana had
influence on the development of the Ik case system, it was through syntax
only and not morphology. Tone plays no role at all in Ik case marking.",[277]
"
As a putative close relative of Ik, the Kuliak So exhibits substantial
morphological decay of an older Kuliak case system that Ik has more fully
retained (Carlin 1993:90-93). The table in (33) presents the author’s
analysis of the current overlap between the case systems in both languages.
Namely, the So ‘goal’ case morpheme -Vk is a relic of the Ik dative case
morpheme {-kɛ} but has taken only some of its semantic roles (goal and
recipient). The Location role of the Ik dative case has been assumed by the
So ‘locative’ case -a/o. But this case now also shares roles handled by the Ik
ablative case {-ɔ} (e.g. location) and in one of its allomorphs shares the
form as well. The So ‘circumstantial’ case seems to take its current form
(-ʊk) from the Ik copulative case, which, in combination with a verb-final
vowel often looks like -ʊkᵓ. The So circumstantial case shares the semantic
roles of instrument and cause with the Ik ablative case:

The present section presents details of each of the eight cases as they apply
to their function in the nominal system. Formal parallels to case suffixes and
their functions in other grammatical subsystems are treated in §6.4.","[277, 278]"
"
Case—an interface of phonology, morphology, syntax—is a pan-systemic
feature of Ik grammar. Not only must every noun be inflected for case, but
even some of the verbal suffixes appear to be grammaticalized case markers.
The Ik case system is split-accusative: Direct objects are marked in the
nominative case with 1/2-person subjects and in the accusative with 3-
person subjects. In the Ik system, eight cases are observed: nominative,
instrumental, ablative, genitive, accusative, dative, copulative, and oblique.",[51]
"
5.1     Personal pronouns
The Ik personal pronominal system has a 1/2/3 personal reference. Each
grammatical person can be either singular or plural. Like the neighboring
Teso-Turkana languages, Ik makes a distinction between first person plural
exclusive (excluding the addressee) and first person plural inclusive
(including the addressee). But unlike in the Teso-Turkana languages,
grammatical gender is not reflected in any part of the Ik pronominal system.
Lastly, Ik has both free personal pronouns and bound pronominal suffixes
on verbs. Both types are described in the following two sections.
202
5.1.1 Free personal pronouns
The Ik free personal pronouns are free grammatical words. The hyphenated
forms in (1) signify not prefixation but rather roots in need of case suffixes:
(1)     Ik free personal pronouns
        1SG             ɲ́ci-
        2SG             bi-
        3SG             ntsí-
        1PL.EXC         ŋɡó-
        1PL.INC         ɲjíní-
        2PL             biti-
        3PL             ńtí-
Case suffixation produces the inflectional variety shown in the next table.
(2) presents a non-final form case paradigm for all seven free personal
pronouns. The nominative and instrumental case forms for 1SG reflect the
morpho-phonological de-affrication described in §2.5.2. And in the ablative
and copulative cases, there is some variation in the degree to which the
pronoun-final /i/ assimilates to the case suffix consisting of /o/ (§2.5.4):

                                                                               203
In terms of internal reconstruction, there appears to be a morphological
relationship between the first person free pronouns: the singular ɲ́ ci- ‘I’, and
the plural ŋɡó- and ɲjíní- ‘we’. It looks like the 1PL.INC ɲjíní- is a pluralization
of the first person singular ɲ́ ci-. Recall from §4.2.5 that the possessive
plurative {-ɪnɪ} may be used to pluralize a possessed or associated person or
object. In light of this, the 1PL.INC ɲjíní- can be analyzed as ɲc+ɪnɪ- → ɲc-íní-
→ ɲjíní-. The change in voicing from /c/ to /j/ is seen in modern Ik in
another pronominal form: ɲj-ɛ́nɪ́- ‘mine’, where -ɛ́nɪ́ is an impersonal
possessum marker (§5.2). Semantically, the first person plural inclusive
pronoun may have grammaticalized from a word meaning something like
‘my Xs’ or ‘those associated with me’, i.e., including you the addressee(s).","[233, 234, 235]"
"
Ik is a pro-drop language, so the free personal pronouns are not required if
their referent is a subject or object. They can be used in addition to the
pronominal subject-agreement suffixes if more emphasis is needed.
                                                                          205
5.1.2 Personal possessive pronouns
Ik has no other personal possessive pronouns than those presented in (1).
Possession is expressed in two ways through those personal pronouns: 1)
The first way is to mark possession by putting the pronoun (PRO) in the
genitive case as an NP modifier, following the possessum NP head. 2) The
second way is to put the pronoun in the oblique case as the first element in
a possessive compound. Both ways are illustrated below. No semantic
difference is known to exist between the two, though pragmatic, discursive
or rhythmic preferences may lead a speaker to chose one over the other.","[236, 237]"
"
The Ik equivalent of the Teso-Turkana mountain names beginning with the
root -moru are formed with the Ik roots ɡwasá- ‘rock’, kokoró- ‘ridge’, kuɓa-
‘hill’ or kwará- ‘mountain’. Such names include the following:
(116)   Ik mountain names
        Irika-kokoró-        ‘Irika Ridge’
        Kɔpa-kwara-          ‘Vulture Mountain’
        Mɔƙɔrɔ́-ɡwasa-       ‘Rock-Pool Stone’
        Palúu-kuɓa-          ‘Palu’s Hill’
        Seɡerí-kwára-        ‘Tree (sp.) Mountain’
        Séítíní-kokóró-      ‘White Quartz Ridge’
        Taɓá-kókóró-         ‘Boulder Ridge’
Finally, many Ik place names are simply single words. For some of them,
their meanings are still recoverable, while for others, they are not:

        Wúsé-              ‘Wus’
5 PronounsThe term ‘pronoun’ is used here rather loosely. This chapter describes words
and affixes that truly represent missing or implied nouns. But it also
includes certain nouns and affixes that have meanings like the pronouns in
other languages (e.g. English). In some cases, it is not easy to tell whether a
particular item is a grammatical word with a pronominal function or a full
lexical noun with a pronoun-like meaning. For example, saí- means ‘some
more’ or ‘some other’, although it inflects fully for case and can take a
nominal complement as in saa róɓaᵉ ‘some other people’. So is it a noun or a
pronoun? The goal of this chapter is to describe anything identified as either
a pronoun or noun with pronominal meanings or functions.","[231, 232, 233]"
"
Even though they adverbially specify a location or direction, the Ik locative
adverbial demonstratives exhibit the structure and behavior of nouns. That
is, they can be inflected for all eight nominal cases and can be modified by
deictic demonstratives as well as relative clauses. When they are modified
by relative clauses, they fulfill the language’s need for locative adverbial
clauses. For example in (34), the locative demonstrative naí- acts as a
peripheral argument (encoding a Destination role) of the verb ƙa- ‘go’. It is
then modified by a relative clause (RC) introduced by the relative pronoun
=noo. The whole construction acts as a locative adverbial clause (LOC ADV):
(34)    Ƙaa nayee noo itsyaketad.
        ƙa-a     [naí-é=[noo             itsyak-et-á=dᵉ]REL]LOC ADV
        go-REAL where-DAT=REL.SG.PST3 begin-INCH- REAL=DP
        She’s going to where she started.
                                                                         441
The whole system of the first set of Ik locative demonstratives is apparently
based on the noun aí- ‘location, side’. This noun, combined with the
nominal spatial demonstratives, produces a system of locative reference that
shows various degrees of grammaticalization and phonological erosion.
Because the noun aí- ‘location, side’ is at the heart of this system, in
principle all members of the paradigm should inflect for all eight Ik nominal
cases. In reality, though, some of the case suffixes have been lexicalized as
part of the noun base and substantially eroded, resulting in case conflation.
(35) shows the synchronic system of locative demonstratives, their
hypothetical diachronic development being discussed below:
(35)    Deictic locative adverbial demonstratives (Set 1)
        Case    Proximal           Medial             Distal

                néé (=na)          néé (=ne)
        ACC     naí-á (=na)        naí-á (=ne)        kɔ́ɔ ́ (=kɛ)
        DAT     naí-é (=na)        naí-é (=ne)        kɔ́ɔ ́ (=kɛ)
                néé (=na)          néé (=ne)
        COP     naí-ó (=na)        naí-ó (=ne)        kɔ́ɔ ́ (=kɛ)
First of all, the proximal and medial forms in (35) are made up of the noun
aí- plus the proximal demonstrative na= as a proclitic. The same
demonstrative is then an optional enclitic for the proximal forms, while the
medial demonstrative =ne is an optional enclitic for the medial forms. The
proclitic nɑ= has apparently undergone phonological reduction. Then, once
nɑ= and aí- were conflated into naí-, it became subject to vowel
assimilation. In the instrumental case, marked by the suffix {-ɔ}, the
resulting form is nóó. This vowel assimilation is expected since the
instrumental case deletes the stem-final vowel. However, in the genitive and
442
dative cases, both of which are marked with the suffix {-(k)ɛ}, the resulting
form is néé. This form involves further phonological reduction:
(36)    Instrumental:          na= +aí-+-ɔ ͏ → nóó
        Genitive/dative:       na= +aí-+-ɛ → naí-é         → néé
As for the distal locative demonstrative, it appears to have undergone
grammaticalization and phonological reduction to the point that it has the
same form in all nominal cases: kɔ́ɔ=
                                    ́ (kɛ). In years past, the distal locative
demonstrative comprised a regular part of the paradigm in which the noun
aí- was flanked on both sides by the distal nominal demonstrative kɛ, as in
ke=aí-é=ke, for example, in the genitive and dative cases. At some point,
the preceding ke= merged with the base noun, and at a later point, the
instrumental case form kɔ́-ɔ́ was substituted for all the cases. Since it has
undergone phonological reduction and morphological conflation to this
degree, the form kɔ́ɔ́ is analyzed here as a single morpheme synchronically.","[472, 473, 474]"
"
Another question relevant to the Ik accusative case is what semantic roles
the object of a transitive clause can take. This question applies to transitive
objects generally, including those marked in the nominative case. Ik direct
objects encode the expected semantic role of Patient, but they can also
encode Direction and/or Purpose. Three Ik verbs of motion—ats- ‘come’, ƙa-
‘go’, and ɪtá- ‘reach’—are unusual in that they can behave like transitive
verbs. Similar motion-verb properties have been reported as common in
Cushitic and Omotic languages (Dimmendaal 2003:100). Old Nubian is
reported to have marked Patients and Directions with the suffix -ka, while
the Semitic language Tigrinya uses its accusative prefix ni-/nä- to mark
Patients, Directions, and many other roles (Dimmendaal 2010:41).
276
The following sentences are examples of a) Ik motion verbs functioning as
transitive verbs and b) object case (NOM or ACC) marking Direction/Purpose:
(130)   Atsaa ƙanesia kuruɓadie ntsi.
        ats-á-á          ƙan-ésí-aO     kúrúɓádi-e ntsí-∅

        go-REAL=PST 1 buy-ACC           food-GEN
        He went to buy food.","[307, 308]"
"
Moving on to compound structure: Compounds reverse the normal noun
phrase word order in which modifiers follow the heads they modify. In
compounds, the modifier appears as N1 followed by the head as the N2.
                                                                            175
Take the compound in (69), for instance, where the noun dakú- ‘tree’ is used
as the modifying N1. Then compare the word order of the compound with
that of a normal noun phrase having the same meaning:
(69)    Compound versus noun phrase
        dakúMOD-ɓɔ́lHEAD       ɓɔ́láHEAD   dakwíMOD
        tree-shin:NOM          shin:NOM tree:GEN
        ‘tree trunk’           ‘trunk of the tree’
As a third structural feature, compounds involve a special case marking: The
N1 takes the oblique case while the N2 takes whatever case the syntax
requires for the whole construction. In the oblique case, the form of the N1
is usually an exact representation of its underlying lexical form. An
exception to this statement is that a noun ending in a VV sequence will lose
its final vowel when joined to another noun in a compound. In the following
examples, the noun bubuu- ‘belly’ is compounded with aƙɔ́- ‘interior’.
Observe that the final vowel of bubuu- is lost and that only the case of the
N2, aƙɔ́-, changes with different clausal argument structures:
(70)    Doda bubuaƙw.
        dód-a          bubu-aƙw-ᵃ
        hurt-REAL      belly[OBL]-interior-NOM
        (My) inner belly hurts.","[206, 207]"
"
A ‘core argument’ in Ik is generally defined as any verbal argument that
cannot be represented by the dummy pronoun (§5.10). Normally such
arguments are encoded with the nominative, accusative, or copulative cases,
but as explained below, various complications occur. And as its label
suggests, the ‘oblique’ case straddles the simple divide between ‘core’ and
‘non-core’ cases: It actually encodes all core arguments in imperative and
optative clauses, as well as a variety of peripheral argument roles in other
types of clauses, but it cannot be represented by the dummy pronoun. The
basic case-marking scheme for clausal arguments in Ik is presented in (3):
(3)     Basic case-marking scheme on clausal arguments
        Core         NOM, ACC, COP, (OBL)        Non-core     INS, ABL, DAT, GEN, (OBL)Subjects (A/S) of indicative clauses always bear the nominative case suffix:

        sleep[3SG]-REAL dog-NOM
        The dog is sleeping.",[265]
"
The type of case-marking neutralization exhibited in (80)-(81) violates
König’s typological prediction #7 for African languages with case: “If the
language is verb-initial or verb-medial, then the ‘no case before the verb’
rule applies” (2008:281). The Surmic language Tennet, spoken not far from
Ik in South Sudan, also violates this prediction, but only partially. But as
hinted at above, normal case marking is retained in Ik subordinate clauses
with sequential aspect verb forms. Note that in the following example, all
core arguments bear the nominative case suffix (including the object):
(82)    Na nka atsʼia ema,...
        [na=ŋk-aA         átsʼ-ɪ-aV              em-aO]COND
        CONJ =I-NOM       gnaw-1SG-SEQ           meat-NOM
        If I gnaw on meat,…

9.8      Relative clauses
Because many Ik subordinate clauses are based on the relative clause
construction, relative clauses need to be discussed without further delay. To
begin with, Ik exhibits a canonical relative clause construction having the
following characteristics (the first four drawn from Dixon 2010:314):
      1. The relative clause (RC) is embedded in a main clause (MC), making
         up one full sentence.
      2. The underlying structure of the RC and MC share a common
         grammatical argument (CA).
      3. The RC functions as syntactic modifier of the CA in the MC.
      4. The RC has the basic structure of a clause, with a predicate and the
         required nominal arguments (as well as peripheral arguments).
      5. All core arguments in the RC are marked in the accusative case, just
         as in all other subordinate clauses (except sequential ones).","[527, 528]"
"9.10 Verbless clauses
Changing gears now from subordinate back to main clauses: Two kinds of
main clause are verbless: 1) the verbless copulative clause (§9.10.1) and 2)
the verbless dative/genitive clause (§9.10.2). These are described next.
518
9.10.1 Verbless copulative clause
Verbless copulative clauses—covered in this section—are ‘verbless’ in the
sense that they put a nominal marked with the copulative case in the
predicate slot. This construction differs from the verbless dative/genitive
clauses which are ‘verbless’ in the sense that they exhibit no predicate slot
at all in the surface structure. In verbless copulative clauses, the predicative
nominal can consist of a noun, pronoun, or nominalized verb. What allows a
noun phrase to function as predicate is none other than the copulative case
(described in detail in §6.3.8). In the copulative case, the copulative suffix
{-kɔ} affixes to the underlying form of the nominal stem:
(143)   Copulative predicates
        Lexical                         Copulative
        cekí-        ‘woman’     →      cekú-kᵒ           ‘It’s a woman’
        ntsí-        ‘s/he/it’   →      ntsú-kᵒ           ‘It’s she.’
        dód-oni-     ‘to hurt’   →      dód-onu-kᵒ        ‘It’s pain.’
The copulative case enables a verbless grammatical alternative to the copula
of identity mɪt-. Though mɪt- expresses both identity and possession, the
copulative case expresses strictly identity. Serzisko further qualifies the
meaning of mɪt- as one of ascription/description’ compared to that of the
copulative which expresses ‘specification’ (1992:55ff).","[549, 550]"
"
In Ik, a noun is any word whose primary function is to be the head of a
noun phrase, which in turn functions as an argument of a verb. As the head
of a noun phrase, a noun must be inflected for case to show its relation to
other words. It may also take other nominal suffixes and may be joined to
another noun or pronoun in a compound construction. A second function of
an Ik noun is to be the head of the predicate. To fulfil this function, a noun
must take the copulative case marker (§6.3.8), which is the functional
equivalent of a copula and allows the noun to stand alone as a sentence.",[163]
"
Another defining property of Ik subordinate clauses is that all core
arguments (A/S/O) are marked with the accusative case. Again, this is
similar to Tennet, where main clauses have a nominative-accusative case-
marking system, while in dependent clauses, this switches to ergative-
absolutive (Dimmendaal 2010:33). Also in this connection, the Saharan
language Tubu, which has Differential Object Marking, an object is more
likely to be marked accusative if not expressed in its normal position (König
                                                                               495
2008:40, cited in Dimmendaal 2010:32). In other words, accusative case is
reserved for pragmatically marked positions. So in Ik, the accusative
marking on subjects (A/S) may have something to do with the subject being
in a pragmatically marked slot, that is, before the verb. The next two
examples illustrate this with intransitive (80) and transitive (81) clauses:
(80)    Noo ncia epiaade kuru,...
        [noo         ɲ́ci-aS    ep-í-á=deV              kurú-∅]TEMP
        CONJ.PST3    I-ACC      sleep-1SG-REAL=DP shade-ABL
        When I slept in the shade,…","[526, 527]"
"
1     Tensed    relative   pronouns    like    noo     (remote   past)   have    been
grammaticalized into use as conjunctions introducing temporal subordinate
clauses. 2 The instrumental case marker {-ɔ} is found on noun phrases
expressing time concepts. 3 This noun phrase in the genitive case modifies
the preceding noun sayo. 4 Relative pronouns are enclitics that convey both
the number of their heads (in this case plural) and the tense of the relative
clause (in this case remote past). 5 The directional suffixes, like the andative
{-ʊƙɔtɪ ́-}, are also used aspectually, here as completive. 6 Because there is a
brief pause between the subordinate and main clauses, the final morpheme,
here the realis suffix {-a}, is devoiced. 7 The verb comes first in unmarked
main clauses. 8 Tense enclitics come between the verb and the following
22
subject(s). 9 The nominative case suffix {-a} marks the subject (A/S) of
indicative main clauses. 10 Oblique (peripheral) arguments, like those
following the coordinating conjunction ńda, are marked with the oblique
case in Ik, which is zero morpheme.","[53, 54]"
"
As    discussed   below    in     §6.4.1,     König   has   traced   a   chain   of
grammaticalization from an old focus marker (cf. the Cushitic parallels) to
both the copulative suffix in the nominal system and the sequential aspect
marker in the verbal system (2002:349-361). And so it would seem that the
Ik copulative case shows the traits of a transitional form between a nominal
and verbal morpheme. This might help explain its cross-categorial behavior.
                                                                            289
6.4     ‘Case’ and grammaticalization
Formal parallels or homophones of the nominal case suffixes are found in
other subsystems of Ik grammar. These are most richly attested in the verbal
system (§6.4.1), though they are also found on demonstratives, relative
pronouns, and tense particles (§6.4.2). This homophony has led to claims
that Ik case is marked on ‘conjunctions, postpositions, prepositions, adverbs,
and even verbs’ (König 2008:81). But this is misleading because most of
these word classes are really nouns or verbs in Ik. The notion that nominal
case suffixes grammaticalized into verbal inflectional affixes is one of the
key claims of König 2002. Using her methodology, Schrock 2013 traces out
several other potential grammaticalization pathways going from nominal
case suffix to verbal affix. The picture emerging from this work is that due
to its near ubiquity, ‘case’ is a unifying structural element in the language.","[320, 321]"

268
The genitive case in Ik has two grammatical functions:
(107)   Genitive case grammatical functions
        1    To mark the nominal modifier of a noun phrase head
        2    To mark the complement of a similative clause
In the genitive’s first function—to mark a noun dependent on its noun
phrase head—the genitive-marked noun encodes Possession broadly
construed, including notions of ownership, whole-part, kinship, attribution,
orientation, association, and nominalization; see also §9.2:
(108)   Ownership:      Kisanini kuruɓadiicikaa nti.
                        kisán-íni    kúrúɓádi-icíká-a       ńtí-∅
                        divide-SEQ things-VAR.PL-ACC        they-GEN
                        And they divided up their various things.","[299, 300]"
"
The case suffixes have L tone but undergo tone changes coming from the
stem to which they attach. Though there are eight cases, only six are
distinct suffixes. Two other case suffixes (the instrumental and the ablative)
are identical in form but differ in whether they subtract the stem-final
vowel. This difference creates the seventh case marker. Finally, an eighth
case (the oblique) is zero-marked. The eight case suffixes are given in (26):

6.2.1 Case allomorphy
The Ik case suffixes undergo intricate morphophonological variations that
have confounded earlier attempts to analyze and describe the case system as
a whole. From Crazzolara 1967 all the way to Schrock 2014, the literature
reveals a progressing understanding of Ik case. Some of these tricky
morphophonological variations include pre-pause devoicing (§2.3.1), inter-
                                                                              241
vocalic consonant deletion (§2.9.3), vowel assimilation (§2.9.4), and vowel
harmony (§3.1). A good way to become familiar with the variations is to
look at the case declensions of several nouns, starting with ŋókí- ‘dog’:
(27)    Case inflection of ŋókí- ‘dog’
        Case     Non-final (/____...#)    Final (/_____#)
        NOM      ŋók-á                    ŋók-ᵃ
        INS      ŋók-ó                    ŋók-ᵒ
        ABL      ŋókú-o                   ŋókú-∅
        GEN      ŋókí-e                   ŋókí-∅
        DAT      ŋókí-e                   ŋókí-kᵉ
        ACC      ŋókí-a                   ŋókí-kᵃ
        COP      ŋókú-o                   ŋókú-kᵒ
        OBL      ŋókí                     ŋókⁱ
As shown in (27), Ik case suffixes have non-final and final forms. This
division entails different things for different groups of case suffixes. First, all
suffixes undergo devoicing in final, pre-pause environments (§2.3.1).
Suffixes that consist of vowels only (NOM, INS, ABL, GEN) are devoiced or
deleted, depending on the preceding consonant or vowel (see §2.3.1). For
suffixes that consist of a -CV sequence (DAT, ACC, COP), their final vowel is
also devoiced or deleted under the same conditions. For the one case that is
zero-marked (OBL), the final vowel of the noun root or stem is devoiced.
Second, all the suffixes that contain the segment /k/ (DAT, ACC, COP) lose the
/k/ in their non-final forms. This deletion of /k/ is part of a larger,
language-wide tendency to delete consonants in non-final positions (§2.9.3).","[272, 273]"
"
6.3.6 Accusative
The accusative case suffix has the form {-ka}, and as such, is one of three Ik
case suffixes that consist of /k/ plus a vowel (the other two being the dative
and the copulative, described below). Potential parallels for this suffix are
widespread in the general Ethio-Sudanic language area. For Nilo-Saharan
accusative cases, “the widest-spread marker is a velar, occurring in at least
six of twelve families; it seems safe to assume this is a reflex of the proto-
form” (Dimmendaal 2010:30), which Ehret reconstructs as *-kɔ̀ (2001:203).
Besides Ik, Shabo (Nilo-Saharan or unclassified) has -kak or -k as an
object/accusative marker (Teferra 1991:9). And the Cushitic language Afar
marks objects on the verb with the morpheme -aka (Mahaffy n.d., p. 29).",[303]
"
Likewise, if the common argument (CA) or head of a normal relative clause
is a peripheral argument in the relative clause, then the dummy pronoun
                                                                             229
must be attached to the verb. This is because the relative pronoun
representing the CA of the relative clause comes before the verb in Ik,
meaning it has been fronted from what would be its normal position after
the verb. This fulfills the requirements for the use of the dummy pronoun:
(68)    Ɗuo nuu didia watad.
        ɗu-ó=nuu                   didi-a           wat-á=dᵉ
        PRO. PL- COP=REL.PL.PST 3 weather-ACC       rain-REAL=DP
        It’s the ones (i.e. reasons) which it rained for.
        ‘That’s why it rained.’
(69)    Odoiciko ni atsiimad.
        ódo-icík-ó=ni           ats-í-ím-a=dᵉ

        give-IMP.PL=DP story[OBL]=ANPH.SG
        give them that storyǃ
In (68), the CA of the main clause (a copular cleft construction) and the
relative clause is the cause or reason for rain. Since it is left-dislocated out
of the relative clause, it is marked with the DP. In (69), the CA of main and
relative clauses is a time expression. In (70), the DP is used twice: 1) First, it
marks the source object of the verb bɪraa ‘it lacks’ that has been fronted
(things lack from in Ik), and 2) second, it marks the recipient object of the
imperative verb maíó ‘give (pl.)’ that is in the previous clause (ɗɑ=nuu).
6 CaseThe description of Ik ‘case’ is placed here between nouns and verbs because
as a meta-categorial system, it applies to both these major word classes.
Case is the backbone of Ik grammar. It permeates nearly every grammatical
subsystem, such that a good grasp of it is key to knowing the language.
Thus, beyond giving an overview of the case system (§6.1), this chapter’s
aim is to lay out the details of case in the nominal system (§6.2-6.3) and
grammaticalized ‘case’ in other systems, particularly that of verbs (§6.4).","[260, 261, 262, 263]"

6.3.7 Dative
The dative case suffix has the form {-kɛ}. Potential areal parallels for it
include the Cushitic language Saho’s goal/source marker -k (Banti & Vergari
2005:14) and the Dhaasanac ‘core adposition’ -(k)i that encodes dative,
benefactive, and instrumental roles (Tosco 2001:232).","[309, 310]"
"
6.2.2 Case origins
The precise origin of the Ik case suffixes is not known, but a clue may come
from how they affix to nominal stems. As noted earlier, the case suffixes can
be grouped according to their suffixation ‘strategy’—subtracting or
preserving the stem-final vowel. These different suffixation strategies may
point to two different origins for the suffixes. Ik syllable structure does not
allow consonant clusters, so those case suffixes that begin with /k/
(accusative {-ka}, dative {-kɛ}, and copulative {-kɔ}) require the stem-final
vowel to remain to prevent a CC sequence. It seems likely, then, that the
ablative {-ɔ} and genitive {-ɛ} may have once contained a consonant as
well, since they preserve the stem-final vowel. The nominative {-a} and
instrumental {-ɔ} suffixes, though, seem to have originated as single vowels
since they do not require the stem-final vowel to break up a CC sequence.",[275]
"
The nominative case marks out the following five grammatical functions:
(58)    Nominative case grammatical functions
        1    The citation or isolation form of nouns.
        2    The subject (A/S) of indicative main clauses.
        3    The subject (A/S) of sequential subordinate clauses.
        4    The object (O) of transitive clauses with 1-2 person subjects.
        5    A fronted (left-dislocated or apposed) argument.",[286]
"
Lastly, for extended transitive verbs, the original transitive subject (A)
becomes the direct object (O), while the original direct object becomes the
484
first extended object (E1) marked with the dative case. And the original
extended object (E1) becomes the second extended object (E2), also in the
dative case. This construction puts Ik in the company of the relatively few
languages worldwide—like Japanese, Turkish, and Kamaiurá—that allow
more than one dative noun phrase in the same clause (Dixon 2012:264):
(46)    Maƙotiaa nka kaudza konie amae.
        ma-ƙot-í-a-a             [ŋk-a]A [kaúdz-a]O [kɔnɪ-ɛ       ámá-ᵉ]E1

        I have given the money to another person.","[515, 516]"
"5.2     Impersonal possessum pronoun
In addition to the personal possessive pronouns shown above in (5), Ik also
has a pronoun that expresses possession without reference to grammatical
person. This impersonal possessum pronoun (PSSM) has the form -ɛnɪ́- (no
plural). It occurs as the second element (N2) of a compound, where the N1 is
the possessing entity. The pronoun itself is used to reference a possessum
that may or may not also be explicitly mentioned, as in bi-ɛn ‘yours’ versus
bi-ɛna awáᵉ ‘your home’. If the possessum is explicitly mentioned, as in bi-
ɛna awáᵉ ‘your home’, it comes after impersonal possessive compound and
takes the genitive case (as in ‘you-PSSM home-GEN’).
                                                                              209
In combination with a personal pronoun, the impersonal possessum is
roughly equivalent in translation to the independent English possessive
pronouns, like ‘mine’, ‘yours’, ‘its’, as in:
(9)      Ik impersonal possessum pronoun
        ɲj-ɛ́nɪ ́-      ‘mine’
        bi-ɛ́nɪ ́-      ‘yours (sg.)’
        nts-ɛ́nɪ ́-     ‘his/hers/its’
        ŋɡó-ɛ́nɪ ́-     ‘ours (exc.)’
        ɲjíní-ɛnɪ-      ‘ours (inc.)’
        biti-ɛnɪ ́-     ‘yours (pl.)’
        ńtí-ɛnɪ-        ‘theirs’
The tone of -ɛnɪ́- changes according to the melody of the compound’s N1. But
because it is in a compound, the dominant [+ATR] value of the N1 does not
spread across the morpheme boundary. The impersonal possessum is
analyzed as an N2 instead of a suffix because, as a general rule: a) It does
not alter the tone of the N1, b) it does not delete the final vowel of the N1,
and c) is it not harmonized for [ATR] by the N1. Nevertheless, it remains
somewhat of a hybrid between suffix and N2 in that: a) It accompanies a
tone change of the N1 in the case of the 1SG (ɲ́ ci- → ɲjˊ-) and b) it deletes the
final vowel of the 1SG and 3SG N2 pronouns (ɲ́ ci- → ɲjˊ- and ntsí- → ntsˊ-).","[240, 241]"
"
The Ik accusative suffix has a L tone but may take a H tone according to the
stem’s tone melody (T7). It is one of the language’s opaque dominant
[+ATR] suffixes and thus can also be represented as {-ka+}. Any recessive
enclitic following the accusative suffix will surface as [+ATR].
272
It does not delete the final vowel of the stem but instead attaches directly to
it. Before a pause, the vowel of the suffix devoices, changing the suffix to
/-kᵃ/ or /-k̚/. And within a phrase, the suffix loses the /k/, changing the
suffix simply to /-a/. If the stem-final vowel is a high back vowel, it may
desyllabify and cause the accusative suffix to lengthen in compensation:

In terms of grammatical function, the accusative case in Ik is used to mark
core clausal arguments, namely the following:
(124)   Accusative case grammatical functions
        1      Direct object (O) of a transitive clause with a 3SG/PL subject
        2      Direct object (O) of all subordinate clauses
        3      Subject (A/S) of any subordinate clause (except sequential)
First, the accusative marks the direct objects (O) of transitive clauses with
third person subjects. If the subject of the clause is first or second person,
then both the subject and the object(s) take the nominative case (§6.3.1).
See, for example, the pattern in the following paradigm, in which the
accusative case (underlined) is found only with the third person verb forms:
                                                                             273

marking the object (O) of transitive clauses with 3SG/PL person subjects:

"
Ik has a two-term inflectional system for marking number on nouns. At the
notional level, this encodes singular and plural. Singular in this system
means ‘one’, and plural means ‘more than one’. The two terms—singular
and plural—can be mapped on the surface level using three different
strategies: 1) a zero-marked, basic singular and a plurative-marked plural,
2) a possessive singulative-marked singular and a possessive plurative-
marked plural, or 3) a singulative-marked singular with a basic, zero-
marked plural. The table in (44) show how these strategies are mapped out:
(44)   Ik nominal number-marking strategies
                      Singular     Plural
        Strategy 1    -∅           -íkó-/-ɪ ́tɪ ́nɪ ́-/-ɪka-
        Strategy 2    (-ɛdɛ-)      -ɪnɪ-
        Strategy 3    -V́ma-       -∅
The plurative {-ɪka} in Strategy 1 is the only fully productive number-
marking nominal suffix in the language. It pluralizes polymoraic roots, and
any newly borrowed noun is polymoraic by virtue of its having the frozen
prefix ɲV-. By the same token, the other two Strategy 1 pluratives are non-
productive, since the nouns they pluralize are in a fixed lexical set. Strategy
2 is semi-productive in that it only applies to semantically specified subsets
of nouns. The parentheses around the singular form of Strategy 2 signify
that while the plural is always the plural of the singular, the plural forms do
not always have a singularized counterpart. Lastly, Strategy 3, while still
operative in Teso-Turkana, is also no longer productive in the Ik of today.
156
These singulatives and pluratives are described in the next several sections.
They are shown mostly in their underlying and therefore hyphenated forms
to expose their final vowels that may be deleted in the nominative case
(isoation form). All the Ik pluratives have parallels in wider Nilotic, for
example Turkana. Like in Turkana, all Ik number-marking suffixes delete
the final vowel of the nominal stem (Dimmendaal 1983:229-232). By way of
introduction, these suffixes are summarized in the following table:

4.2.1 Plurative I
The Ik plurative I {-íkó-} is found pluralizing both monomoraic and
polymoraic nominal stems. It is not productive: The nouns it pluralizes
belong to a fixed lexical set that, as far as can be observed, does not admit
new members. The plurative I seems to be a parallel of the Turkana
pluralizer -íyó (Dimmendaal 1983:235), which if true, would suggest that
the intervocalic /k/ was retained in Ik and lost in Turkana.","[187, 188]"

Because Ik is an argument-dropping language (even core arguments), one
cannot guess the transitivity of a verb from syntax or semantics. But at least,
Ik verb roots are lexically specified as intransitive, transitive, or ditransitive
(extended transitive). As mentioned above, intransitive verbs are identified
by the infinitive suffix {-ɔnɪ-}, while the suffix {-ɛ́sɪ ́-} identifies transitives
and   ditransitives.   And      a    significant    number      of   verb   roots   are
ambitransitive—able to be intransitive or transitive, for example:
(6)     Some Ik ambitransitive verb roots
        ábʊƙ-      ábʊbʊƙ-ɔn         ‘to charge (of animals)’
                   ábʊbʊƙ-ɛ́s        ‘to scoop out’
        dzɛr-      dzɛr-ɔn           ‘to tear off running’
                   dzɛr-ɛ́s          ‘to tear’
        fút-       fút-ón            ‘to blow (intrans.)’
                   fút-és            ‘to blow (trans.)’
        ídz-       ídz-on            ‘to drain, emit’
                   ídz-es            ‘to shoot’
        iʝók-      iʝók-ón           ‘to drool’
                   iʝok-esˊ          ‘to lend’
Ditransitive verbs can be identified by their imperative forms: If the
imperative of a verb requires the dummy pronoun enclitic {=ˊ(d)ɛ}, that
means an obligatory argument requires a morphological trace. The only
three ditransitive verbs identified so far include eɡ- ‘put’, ɪŋaar- ‘help’, and
ma- ‘give’ (Heine & König 1996:30). These are exemplifed in (7):
(7)     Ik ditransitive verb roots
        Root       Imperative
        eɡ-        eɡ-é=dᵉ               (**eɡ-ᵉ)            ‘Put (it) (somewhere)ǃ’
        ɪŋaar-     ɪŋaar-ɛs-ɛ́=dᵋ        (ɪŋaar-ɛ́s-∅)       ‘Help (someone)ǃ’
        ma-        ma-é=dᵉ               (**ma-ᵉ)            ‘Give (it) (to someone)ǃ’
                                                                               305
As discussed back in §6.3.6 on the topic of the accusative case, a handful of
Ik motion verbs can be used intransitively or transitively. According to
Dimmendaal, this is a property common in Cushitic and Omotic languages
(2003:100). Ik ambitransitive motion verbs include ats- ‘come’, ɪtá- ‘reach’,
and ƙa- ‘go’. When used intransitively—as seems to be the normal case—
their Goal or Destination is encoded with the dative case (-kᵋ). But when
used transitively, their Goal~Purpose is encoded with a direct object case:
either nominative (1-2 person subject) or accusative (-kᵃ) (3 person). Even
so, the verb ɪtá- behaves a little differently than the other two. It appears to
be a transitive verb with the ability to intransitivize: With a dative object, it
has a meaning usually translated as ‘find’ in English:
(8)     Ik ambitransitive motions verbs
        Root                         Object case
        ats-        atsa awá-kᵉ      Dative        ‘He’s coming home.’
                    atsa zɛƙɔ́-kᵃ    Accusative    ‘He’s coming to sit.’
        ɪtá-          ɪtáá ńtí-kᵉ    Dative        ‘He’s found them.’
                    ɪtáá awá-kᵃ      Accusative    ‘He’s reached home.’
        ƙa-          ƙaá hoo-kᵉ      Dative        ‘He’s going in the hut.’
                   ƙaa rɔ́ƙɛ́sɪ-kᵃ   Accusative    ‘He’s going bee-keeping.’
Finally, a few Ik verbs are lexically specified for the number of one of their
arguments—the subject if intransitive and the object if transitive. The
following four pairs illustrate these number-based classes:
(9)     Number-based Ik verb root classes
        Singular       Plural
        bad-           tsʼé-         ‘to die’

7.1.1 Basic roots
Ik basic verb roots are those considered morphologically unanalyzable. In
some cases, insights gained from further historical-comparative research
may disqualify some members currently put in this class of verbs. As the
class stands, it exhibits eighteen syllable patterns and accompanying tone
melodies. Each of these patterns is presented below, beginning with the
most frequently occuring in a sampling of approximately 1000 verb roots.","[335, 336, 337, 338]"
"
2.5.2 De-affrication
In the introduction of this grammar, the Ik word for themselves (Ikᵃ) and the
Ik word for ‘head’ (ikᵃ) were said to be homophonous in the nominative
case. In accordance with their homophony, it has been suggested that the Ik
people were the ‘head’ of ancient migrations. But their being the same word
historically is challenged by the fact that in the other cases, their base forms
are different: icé- ‘Ik’ and iká- ‘head’. Comparing the full case declensions of
these two noun roots opens up the discussion of (de-)affrication:
70
(68)     Non-final case paradigm for icé- ‘Ik’ and iká- ‘head’

         COP            icé-ó/icó-ó      ikó-ó
As discussed further in §6.3, the Ik nominative and instrumental case
suffixes first subtract the final vowel of the root to which they attach. This
means that for icé- ‘Ik’, once the /é/ is deleted, the /c/ is directly exposed to
the nominative suffix {-a} or the instrumental suffix {-ɔ}. So, unlike in other
regional languages where affrication of /k/ to /c/ before high vowels is
common (e.g. Luganda), (68) presents a situation in Ik where /c/ de-
affricates to /k/ before non-front vowels /a/ and /o/. De-affrication is also
attested in other roots similar to icé-, like wicé- ‘children’ and ɲ́ci- ‘I’.","[101, 102]"
"
6.4.1 ‘Case’ on verbs
König 2002 argued that Ik has grammaticalized nominal case suffixes into
TAM verbal suffixes. The most prominent examples of this are 1) the dative
290
suffix turned marker of the simultaneous aspect (‘subjunctive’ in König’s
terminology) and 2) the copulative suffix turned marker of the sequential
aspect (‘narrative’ in König’s terminology). Consider these examples:
(173)   Grammaticalization of dative into simultaneous
        Dative                       >     Simultaneous
        ɓóré-kᵉ       corral-DAT     >     ats-i-kᵉ        come-3SG-SIML
        sɪsɪ ́-kᵋ     mead-DAT       >     ƙɔ́ɗ-ɪ ́-kᵋ     cry-3SG-SIML
(174)   Grammaticalization of copulative into sequential
        Dative                       >     Simultaneous
        ɓóré-kᵒ       corral-COP     >     ats-u-kᵒ        come-3SG-SEQ
        sɪsʊ́-kᵓ      mead-COP       >     ƙɔ́ɗ-ʊ́-kᵓ      cry-3SG-SEQ
The data in (173) show that the dative case suffix and the simultaneous
aspect suffix are identical in form ({-kɛ} and its various allomorphs). And as
shown in (174), the copulative case suffix and the sequential aspect suffix
are also identical in form ({-kɔ} and its allomorphs). König establishes the
putative grammaticalization link between these nominal and verbal suffixes
based on the following five points (adapted from 2002:318-319, 414):
(175)   Evidence of case>verbal suffix grammaticalization
        1.    Their forms are identical.
        2.    Their morphophonological behavior is identical.
        3.    Their position in the word (i.e. always at the end) is identical.
        4.    The simultaenous and sequential suffixes show similar syntactic
              behavior (e.g. they are both used in subordinate clauses).
        5.    They exhibit other similar characteristics, such as:
              a.    Their non-final/final forms.
              b. Their form consisting of /k/ plus a silent vowel.
              c.    Their deletion of /a/ in the preceding stem.
              d. Their exclusion from negated verb forms.
                                                                          291
In König’s view, both the copulative case suffix and the sequential
(‘narrative’) aspect marker were later developments from a nominal focus
marker that was also a development from a copular suffix on nouns
(2002:349-361). Paradoxically, she concludes that a focus marker encoding
discontinuity developed into a ‘narrative’ mood marker encoding discourse
continuity (2002:360). From a synchronic point of view, the copulative case
in the nominal system and the sequential aspect in the verbal system do
seem to focus attention on a given noun or verb. For nouns, this attention
has a focal or copular function. For verbs, this attention simply highlights
the point-by-point sequence of a text. In both systems, the morpheme {-kɔ}
focuses attention on the respective item, as in the following:
(176)   ámá-kᵒ       person- COP          ‘It IS [a person].’
        ats-u-kᵒ     come-3SG-SEQ         ‘It IS [s/he/it came].’
As for the homophonous dative /simultaneous (‘sujunctive’) marker {-kɛ},
König states that “In Icetot, the starting point in the grammaticalization of
the dative into the subjunctive was probably an application of the dative as
a purpose marker: first of all, together with a noun; then with a verbal noun;
and finally, with an inflected verb” (2002: 264, italics in original).","[321, 322, 323]"
"
In their basic underlying forms, every Ik nominal root and suffix ends in a
vowel, without exception. This final vowel is unpredictable since it can be
any of the language’s nine contrastive vowels. Because of this, these final
vowels are treated universally as part of the root in Ik. Similar ‘terminal
vowels’ in the East Cushitic Dhaasanac are only viewed as part of the stem
in some cases where they “are by and large meaningless elements…[maybe]
ancient desemanticized gender markers” (Tosco 2001:65). And like the
Omotic language Dime (Mulugeta 2008), Ik has some nouns whose root-
final vowel has two free variants, e.g. kɔlá~kɔlɛ́- ‘goat’ and zɪná~zɪnɔ́-
‘zebra’. Such cases seem to arise along the lines of chronolects and idiolects.

        mɛsɛ-     ‘beer’                           sɔkɔ́-     ‘hoof’
Root-final vowels like those shown above in (2) are deleted in three
environments: 1) with the nominative case suffix {-a}, 2) with the
instrumental case suffix {-ɔ}, and 3) with any of the number suffixes. The
other six case markers preserve the stem-final vowel (see more in §6.2). This
recalls the situation in the South Omotic language Dime, where any suffix
beginning with a vowel first subtracts the noun-final vowel (Mulugeta
2008:38, 41). It is noteworthy that all but two Ik nominal suffixes that
delete noun-final vowels also begin with a vowel. The two exceptions, the
ablative {-ɔ} and the genitive {-ɛ}, may have lost their initial consonants.","[164, 165]"
"
Unless the traditional definition of case is revised to include functors outside
the nominal system, it is useful to speak of ‘case’ and ‘Case’ in Ik. The
former is a way the language encodes grammatical relations, and the latter
is a meta-categorial or mono-systemic archi-morphology whose precise
origin and path of grammaticalization is not always known. In some
instances, there is a demonstrable semantic link between a form in one
system and its parallel in another, but in other instances, there is not.",[321]
"
The seventh function of the oblique case is to mark nouns coming after any
of the following five prepositions: akɪlɔ ‘instead of’ and (i)kóteré ‘because of’
(from Teso-Turkana), ɡone ‘until/up to’, ńꜜda ‘and/with’, and páka ‘until/up
to’ (from Swahili). Three other prepositions take the genitive case (see
§8.5). The fact that the oblique case is used after mostly-borrowed
prepositions confirms that the oblique is a case for ‘left-over’ case functions.",[282]
"
In terms of grammatical function, the ablative case is used to mark non-core
clause arguments with ‘from’ or ‘at’ semantic roles including the following:
(89)    Ablative case semantic roles
        1    Source
        2    Cause
        3    Stimulus
        4    Location
        5    Experiencer
First, the ablative case is used to mark peripheral arguments that encode the
physical or geographical Source of an action or motion. The following
sentences illustrate this prototypical ablative role:
(90)    Atsia naa awoo ne
        ats-í-á=naa               awó-ó=ne
        come-1SG -REAL=PST1       home-ABL=DEM.SG.MED
        I came from that home.
(91)    Ƙanetaa ʝumʊʝumasia cuaaƙo.
        ƙan-et-á-á            ʝʊmʊʝʊm-asɪ ́-a cuá-áƙɔ-∅
        take-VEN-REAL-PRF     sand-ABST-ACC    water-inside-ABL
        He has taken sand out of the water.
264
Second, the ablative case is used to mark peripheral arguments that encode
the Location of an action or state. The first two sentences below illustrate
this role with intransitive verbs, while the second two do it with transitives:
(92)    Sarata epa hoikao.
        sár-át-a          ep-a         hó-íka-ᵒ
        still-3PL-REAL    sleep-REAL hut-PL-ABL
        They are still sleeping in the huts.","[295, 296]"

In none of the preceding three sentences would the dative case be
grammatical on the direct object (O) encoding Direction and/or Purpose.
These examples are interesting in that the dative case (next section) is used
more generally to encode both Purpose and Goal/Direction. It is only the
unique combination of these roles that transitivize the verb and objects.",[308]
"
Adverbial functions are often handled in Ik by nouns and verbs. For
example, nouns in the instrumental or dative cases can be used to modify a
predicate. In (48) below, the nominalized verb ɪsɪ́lɔ́n ‘to be peaceful’ is given
the instrumental case to elaborate on the manner in which the person was
settled down. Then in (49), the noun kédi- ‘way’ is put in the dative case,
also to express the manner in which it was getting cloudy:
(48)    Zeƙwitetesa bia isilon.
        zɛƙw-ɪt-ɛt-ɛ́s-á             bi-a       ɪsɪ ́l-ɔ́n-ʷ
        sit-CAUS-INCH-INT -REAL      you.SG-ACC be.peaceful-INF-INS
        He will settle you down peacefully (i.e. with peace).",[480]
"
Besides their phonological identity, the nominative case {-a} and the realis
{-a} share a significant morphological characteristic: They both subtract the
final vowel of the stem or affix to which they attach. To illustrate this, the
first column in (180) shows the underlying forms, first of noun roots with
the nominative suffix, and then of verb roots and pronominal subject
markers with the realis suffix. The second column then shows how {-a} in
both systems subtracts the preceding nominal or verbal stem-final vowel:
(180)   Grammaticalization of nominative > realis
        Nouns

        ats-i-a     →        ats-a       come-3SG -REAL
294
Interestingly, similar suggestive commonalities are found to exist between
the oblique case morpheme and the irrealis modality morpheme, both of
which are zero (∅). Being zero-marked, the oblique case allows a noun
stem’s underlying form to surface (often with minor tonal changes).
Likewise, the irrealis modality allows the underlying form of the preceding
verbal morpheme to surface. In (181), the first column presents the
underlying forms of several noun and verb stems with the oblique or Irrealis
marker. The second column reveals their non-final surface forms:
(181)   Grammaticalization of oblique > irrealis
        Nouns
        ɓóré-∅      →        ɓóré        corral[OBL]

        ats-i-∅     →        ats-i       come-3SG [IRR]
Based on the data above in (180), a plausible claim can be made that the
nominative case {-a} and the realis modality {-a} are related historically.
Whether one came from the other or both came from somewhere else is not
known. And based on the data in (181), the same claim can be made for the
oblique case and the irrealis modality which are both marked by {-∅}.","[325, 326]"
"
6.4.2 ‘Case’ in other word classes
Formal parallels of Ik nominal case markers are also found on
demonstratives, relative pronouns, and tense particles. The situation is less
surprising if one considers that both tense particles and relative pronouns
298
developed out of demonstratives. Ik tensed demonstratives and tensed
relative pronouns are identical in form and are marked for Ik’s three-term
past tense system: recent past, removed past, and remote past:
(185)   Ik tensed demonstratives/relative pronouns
                         Singular                    Plural
        Non-past         =na        ‘this/which’     =ni      ‘these/which’
        Recent past      =náka      ‘that/which’     =níki    ‘those/which’
        Removed past     =sɪna      ‘that/which’     =sini    ‘those/which’
        Remote past      =nɔkɔ      ‘that/which’     =nuku    ‘those/which’
As can be seen in (186), the non-past form of the demonstrative/relative
pronouns provides the base on which the other tense forms are built:
(186)   Analysis of tensed demonstratives/relative pronouns
        Non-past          =na          =ni
        Recent past       =ná-ka       =ní-ki
        Removed past      =sɪ-na       =si-ni
        Remote past       =nɔ-kɔ       =nu-ku
In (186), the base (non-past) forms of the demonstratives/relative pronouns
are in bold print—na for singular and ni for plural. Vowel assimilation
changes na to nɔ in the remote past singular and ni to nu in the plural. The
recent past and remote past forms form have suffixes resembling a case
marker. (Only the removed past shows a prefix instead—sɪ-/si-, which is
probably related to the        South Omotic language Dime’s           proximal
demonstrative element si- (Mulugeta 2008:73).) The recent past form of the
Ik singular demonstrative has -ka as a suffix. This is homophonous with the
accusative case suffix {-ka} and nearly so with the present perfect marker
{-ˊka}. Likewise, the remote past singular demonstrative has -kɔ as a suffix.
This resembles the copulative suffix and sequential aspect marker {-kɔ}.
                                                                           299
Two of these Ik demonstratives have grammaticalized not only into relative
pronouns but also into tense clitics. During that process, the deictic function
a demonstrative has over a single noun or a noun phrase was extended to
whole clauses. Since clauses are singular, the singular forms of the
demonstratives were borrowed to function as tense markers. The tense
markers for recent past and remote past are identical to demonstratives,
while the removed past marker shows a different form of unknown origin:
(187)   Ik tense clitics
                            Non-final form    Final form
        Recent past         =náa              =nákᵃ
        Removed past        =bɛɛ              =batsᵋ
        Remote past         =nɔɔ              =nɔkᵓ
The discussion above examining the recent past and remote past singular
demonstratives applies equally to the recent and remote past tense enclitics.
For the removed past tense enclitic, the segment /ts/ is missing in the non-
final form, leading to vowel assimilation. The origin of the suffix /-tsɛ/ is
unknown, though it recalls the Proto-Gumuz word *tsa ‘body’ that has been
grammaticalized in Gumuz for several different uses (Ahland 2012:251).","[329, 330, 331]"
"
Thirdly, the instrumental case is used to encode peripheral arguments that
denote an entity with which an agent goes somewhere. This role is
‘instrumental’ in that the agent takes an object somewhere by the hand to
thereby achieve some goal. This case role is most common with inanimate
objects or animate entities that have little control over the event. The
following two sentences show this Comitative role of the instrumental case:
(79)    Ƙoyaa naa kuruɓad.
        ƙó-í-a=naa               kúrúɓád-ᵒ
        go-1SG-REAL=PST1 things-INS
        I went with (my) things.
260
(80)    Atsuo eakwa ƙayuo nk, zeiike ʝik.
        ats-u-o          e̯akw-a          ƙa-i-o      ŋk-ᵒ       ze-íí-ke     ʝɪ ́kᶦ
        come-3SG -SEQ    man- NOM         go-3SG- SEQ I-INS      big-1SG-SIML ADV
        And the man came and went with me, I being quite grown up.","[291, 292]"
"
The impersonal possessum pronominal also combines with full nouns, as in:
(10)     Impersonal possessum with nouns/nominalized verbs
        aɗ-oni-ɛnɪ ́-     the third time (lit. ‘to be three’s)
        cɪkámá-ɛ́nɪ-      the womens’
        icé-ɛ́nɪ-         the Iks’ (language, customs, etc.
        ɲɔtɔ́-ɛ́nɪ-       the mens’
        wicé-ɛ́nɪ-        the children’s
210
5.3     Indefinite pronouns
Ik has eight indefinite pronouns, listed in (11). But most of the indefinite
pronouns are bimorphemic or compounds. The first four in the table are
formed on the basis of kɔnɪ́- ‘some, another’ which is related to the verb kɔn-
‘be one’. The next three are based on kíní- ‘some (pl.)’, the plural
counterpart to kɔnɪ́-. The last pronoun in the table (saí-) is the only free form
apart from kɔnɪ ́-. All these indefinite pronouns can a) be fully inflected for
case, and b) some can occur with or without explicit nominal complements.","[241, 242]"
"
Two of the past tense clitics—the remote past =nɔkɔ and the recent past
=náka—are identical in form to demonstratives and relative pronouns of
the same tense specification. Ik demonstratives are tensed (see §8.2), and it
is suggested here that relative pronouns and two of the three tense particles
may have developed out of the demonstrative system:
(291)   A comparison of tensed grammatical systems
                       Demonstratives    Relative pronouns      Tense clitics
        Recent         ná-ka             ná-ka                  ná-ka
        Removed        sɪ-na             sɪ-na                  (ba-tse)
        Remote         nɔ-kɔ             nɔ-kɔ                  nɔ-kɔ
A comparison of the three grammatical systems shows they are linked by
what appear to be archaic morphemes: *-ˊka for recent past, *-(t)se/sɪ? for
removed, and *-kɔ for remote. The suffix *-ˊka is related to the present
perfect suffix {-ˊka}, and both may be linked to the Afar language’s -ka
meaning ‘before’ (Mahaffy, n.d., p. 29). As for *-kɔ, it has obvious ties to the
morpheme {-kɔ} which marks both copulative case and sequential aspect.
422
7.11.2 Non-past tense adverbials
Dixon claims that languages divide neatly into the following two groups
according to how a ‘future’ setting is handled grammatically (2012:7):
(292)    I Future is a tense, referring to a location in time.
         II Future is shown by modalities, within irrealis.","[453, 454]"
"
6.3.1 Oblique
The oblique case is the only zero-marked (Ø) case in Ik. As such, it
segmentally mirrors a noun’s basic underlying lexical form. But in their non-
final forms, nouns with a tone melody LH surface as LL. That is, tone may
minorly distinguish the oblique case from the lexical base of some nouns. In
the oblique case, stem-final vowels are devoiced or deleted before a pause.
The paradigm for oblique, as well as those for the other cases, show nine
nouns each ending with one of the language’s nine contrastive vowels:
(34)    Oblique case paradigm

                                                                          247
        ɓóré-Ø               ɓóré            ɓór    ‘corral’
        ɲɛƙɛ-Ø               ɲɛƙɛ            ɲɛƙᵋ   ‘hunger’
        ŋʊrá-Ø               ŋʊra            ŋʊr    ‘cane rat’
        zɪnɔ́-Ø              zɪnɔ            zɪn    ‘zebra’
        ɗéró-Ø               ɗéró            ɗér    ‘rat’
        kafʊ-Ø               kafʊ            kafᶷ   ‘thorn’
        dakú-Ø               daku            dakᵘ   ‘tree’
Despite the near identity of a noun’s basic form and oblique case form, the
Oblique must be maintained as a proper case of its own. This is because it is
required for specific, unique grammatical relations and semantic roles.","[278, 279]"
"
By contrast, the claim made in this grammar is that the morpheme {-a} is
functionally very significant, as both a marker of nominative case and realis
modality in the verbal system (§7.6.2). This morpheme has a L tone but
assimilates to the tone melody projected by the stem it attaches to (T7). It is
one of the language’s opaque dominant suffixes (§3.1.3), and as such can
also be represented as {-a+}. One if the nominative’s characteristics that has
produced confusion in the past is its subtraction of stem-final vowels. It and
the instrumental case suffix {-ɔ} are the only two cases that do this. Before
pauses, the nominative surfaces as /-ᵃ/ or /-∅/. Lastly, if a noun’s final
vowel is a back vowel, it may desyllabify before {-a}:
                                                                         253

On stems with back vowels (/ɔ, o, ʊ, u/) as their final vowel, one cannot
predict whether the vowel will be deleted or desyllabified. Out of a sample
of sixty-eight nouns ending in a back vowel, only the following fifteen
(22%) underwent desyllabification (in order of root-final back vowel):
(57)    Desyllabification of back vowels in the nominative case

Contrary to the nouns in (57), most nouns ending in a back vowel lose the
vowel entirely in the nominative and instrumental cases (see next section),
as in sɔkɔ́- → sɔk-a ‘root- NOM’ and habu- → hab-a ‘tree.hive-NOM’. Looking at
nouns that delete their final vowel versus those that desyllabify it, the
reason for this discrepancy is not obvious. It likely represents a historical
morphological change toward or away from desyllabification. That
nominative-case desyllabification is lexical and not post-lexical is shown by
the fact that compensatory lengthening does not occur on the case suffix.
Back vowels also desyllabify after the non-final accusative case allomorph /-
a/, but when they do, compensatory lengthening occurs. For example,
compare dakú- ‘tree’ as dakw-a ‘tree-NOM’ and as dakw-áá ‘tree-ACC’.","[284, 285, 286]"
"
Ik pronominals comprise a) independent words, b) words found only in
compounds, c) clitics, and d) suffixes. All pronominals inflect for case,
except for relative pronouns, clitics and verbal suffixes. Some of the
pronominals are invariable in terms of grammatical number, while others
have suppletive plurals or can be pluralized with one of the language’s
pluratives. When it comes to personal pronouns, Ik is a pro-drop language,
requiring minimally only bound pronominal subject-agreement suffixes.",[233]
"
Besides Possession, the second grammatical function of the genitive is to
mark the complement of a similative clause. Similative clauses in Ik are
formed with the special verb ƙám- ‘be like’ (cf. Swahili kama and West Rift
Cushitic qoom-). Similative clauses have the schema ‘X is like Y’, where X is
in the nominative case and Y in the genitive case. This in interestisng
example of a genitive used as a clausal argument instead of an NP modifier:
                                                                          271
(121)   Ƙamata dziberikae.

        They are like axes.","[302, 303]"

As noted above, any post-lexical noun must have a case suffix. Six out of the
eight Ik cases allow the stem-final vowel to persist. Only the nominative and
the instrumental (as well as number suffixes) first subtract it. The practical
problem is that the citation or isolation form of a noun in Ik takes the
nominative case, thereby losing its final vowel. This means than unless a
noun is given in one of the six non-subtractive cases, a non-native speaker
134
cannot guess the final vowel. For this reason, whenever the final vowel of a
noun is relevant to a particular point or purpose (for example in Appendix
B—Ik root lexicon), an abstract form of the noun is written with a hyphen.","[165, 166]"
