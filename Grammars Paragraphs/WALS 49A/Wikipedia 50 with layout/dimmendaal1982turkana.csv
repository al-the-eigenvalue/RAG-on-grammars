  1 (ct. Miller (1972)). In Turkana the suffixes may occur with verbs whose
  asic meaning is dynamic, and, in a derived sense, with verbs with a basic
  tative meaning, in order to indicate a dynamic usage (inchoative and affec-
   ive yerbs). (See also Closs Traugott (1978) for an analysis of the phenomenon.)
   . The tense vowel of the number suffix, as well as the (phonetically) tense
   spectual marker preceding it are probably due to the following historical
   hift, pre-dating Turkana:
                                                                                            *C

                                   *y et e
      The suffix *-e occurring in the singular and plural was probably based
  n the instrumental marker, which is still found synchronically in Turkana.
  orther details for this development are given in a synchronic and diachronic
  omparison of the syntax of Nilotic languages (in preparation).

in the brief outline of case-coding and corresponding case relations above,                     as in example (2) shows that number marking is not rendered in a unified                                                                                                way in the case of a stativized verb construction, the (derived) subject
it was noted that the syntactic function subject of intransitive and tran-sitive sentences is marked by the nominative case, whereas the syntactic                        behaves like a direct object or indirect object in a corresponding dynamicfunctions direct object and indirect object of transitive sentences present                      verb construction with regard to number, but not with reaard to person andthe unmarked, absolute case in most constructions. Similarly, it was noted                        case marking. Accordingly, an asymmetry occurs with regard to the way case                                                                                                  is coded in Turkana. Direct objects occur in the nominative if the predi-
 that noun phrases trigger off agreement on verbs.

 of their conjugational pattern. This distinction is also effective with re-                      of the plurative marker {-^ }, although plural abstract nouns are rarely

Factitive nouns are based on transitive verbs, which are mostly dynamic,although some examples occur which are based on transitive verbs of state.                                                -tuk         'gather'
The latter type of nouns are different in form from the former. The former                                                -poc         'peel'
nouns denote the result of the activity expressed by a dynamic verb. Such                                                 -bul         'cut open'
verbs are typically telic, i.e. situations described by these verbs have                                                  -rem          'spear'

           'I am äs big äs you'
                                                                                   instead of a predicative form. The verb root used is -iko, 'compare' .
        Alternatively, the same Stative verb root can be conjugated, although      It is probably a doublet with the verb form -lkwa above. In the Singular
the form is defective since no Stative marker is suffixed to the stem in           a number suffix /-ni/ is added, and in the plural (which includes the
this case. As in the manner adverb, a habitual extension /-aan/ occurs             first person plural in this case) , the number marker is /-te/. Examples:

Similarly, given the deletion ruie for tautosyllabic glides,

     Diphthongs in Turkana also may arise äs a result of the following optional                     syllables with a sequence [uy] are optionally changed into forms with the

      Furthermore, diphthongs may arise äs a result of a shift of /o/ to [wa]

9.1.5. A note on indirect questions                                                   In asking 'why' (i.e. about a cause or reason), the noun indicating 'matter'
With certain types of indirect questions, the question word is retained,              or 'case' is used äs an anaphoric element:
whereas with others a slightly different construction is used. In all cases                   (8) ji-a-yen-i a-yol] na-kiro^ na-e-a-ker-it-o-r^ nes^
the question word, or some other anaphoric marker, precedes the subordinate                             not-I-know-A I (N) mattters which-3-PA-fear-A-V-SÜBJ he (N)
clause just äs noun phrases that are raised from a subordinate clause. In                       'I do not know why he was afraid'
this way the behaviour of raised noun phrases and question words is the same.
                                                                                              No data are available on indirect questions with 'when' and 'how'.
This analogy is also found when they occur in sentence-initial position, äs
shown in section 7.8. above.
                                                                                      9.2. Negation

  Words in Turkana may have an initial consonant and/or a final consonant.                                                                                    not: ** [ a @kj'- '. si @na]

     With a number of grammatical processes haplology occurs obligatorily,                                      There is an optional ruie in the language occurring in rapid Speech only
however, without meeting the condition mentioned above with regard to tone                                      whereby short high vowels are elided between consonants. This results in

Initial consonants of a sequence of two syllables within a word may inter-

 2.6.6. The phonological syllable
 in the discussion of the phonetic syllable it was noted that the nucleus                              (C) (G) V         (open syllable)
 may be formed by a short vowel. Turkana also has words with open and closed                            (0 (G) V C (closed syllable)
 syllables (phonetically) that have a long vowel:                                                      The onset of a phonological or phonetic syllable is irrelevant, as seems

     However, syllabic units of this type function as disyllabic units at a
