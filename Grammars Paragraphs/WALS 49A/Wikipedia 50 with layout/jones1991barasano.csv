"   4,10. Postpositional phrases. Postpositions occur following noun phrases.
They head the noun phrase and bear the phrase’s case markers. The following
are examples of postpositional phrases with the postpostions hoe ‘on top of
and gudareko ‘middle’.(172) oho           hii-ro     — hoe

                                     Case  Barasano is a nominative-accusative language. The subject in Barasano
bears no case marking whereas the object is generally marked when it is
definite. Regarding word order, the subject is sentence initial when first
introduced or in special focus and is sentence final elsewhere.
  Barasano has four morphemes which mark case though not obligatorily:
-re occurs on noun phrases in the roles of object, experiencer, benefactee,
and manner; réka occurs on noun phrases of accompaniment and
instrument, -h# marks locations or times; and ya marks the genitive (see
§4.8).
                                    §.1-5.3 -re  The    ending   -re is used     to mark     the   object,   the   experiencer,   and
benefactee. It is also used to mark manner, which is discussed in §11.9.","[81, 82, 83]"

  The Eduria dialect has -basu ‘really’ instead of -goda.

                               Noun           Phrase  This   chapter   discusses     the   constituents    of the   noun   phrase   which
includes classifiers, quantifiers, numerals, noun-noun structures, descriptive
modifiers, and postpositions. 12 In general, the head of the noun phrase
occurs as the last constituent unless it is in focus or being topicalized, in
which case it occurs first.","[65, 66, 67]"
"  When the previous context to which yw refers is viewed as time-
consuming or as a logical argument necessary to set up the state for the
following event, -kod-ri (fulfillment participle) is added to yi, e.g., (105).(105) to       bahi-ro        yi-koa-ri      wa-ko-a-su-hu                 i

(object) which marks objects of verbs or any nonsubject word which is
thematic, ie., of primary importance in the ongoing discourse. Generally
these objects are highly individuated. For example, all pronouns which
occur as objects take -re (object). In the case of nominalized clauses where
the verb is transitive, the object marker is crucial to the meaning. Compare
the genitive construction of (106) with the object in (107):(106) 7    bue-g
      3ms_study-ms
      his student(107) i-re            bue-gu
       3ms-O      study-ms
       one who teaches him  When the object is not thematic, it need not occur with -re (object) even
though it may be highly individuated. For example, in (108) kakw ‘dad’ is
only mentioned and does not become a real part of the story till later.
Thus the speaker did not mark kaku ‘dad’ as the object of ia ‘to see’.(108) ti-ribu-re          — wadi-ka-hu               ye   ado-hu       dobigo     _ya-ro
       that-day-o              come-far*pst--3       1s   here-place   domingo    be-NoM             kak-ut                  ia-gu
             my parent-ms             see-ms
       On that day I came here, a Sunday, in order to see dad.","[52, 53]"
"  The    possessive    clause    may    also        be   formed   with ke/kuti   or kvo,   both
meaning ‘to have’; ku/kzti is generally used when the possessed is perceived
as an inherent characteristic of the possessor, e.g., ‘A head has hair’, or ‘T
have the name John’ as in (342).(342) hia       wabe       kuti-a-ha           ye
        John   name _ have-prReEs--3           1s
        I have the name John.   hai ‘to be big’ is often used in possessive clauses. In such cases, hai is
generally nominalized with animate nominalizers which refer to the
possessor. In (343) hai-gu ‘one who has a lot of is the possessor and we-ri
‘dirt’ is the possessed:(343) ie-ri        hai-gu—-ya-a-bi
      dirty-PTcPL big-ms        be-PRES-3ms
      He is very dirty. (lit. He has a lot of dirt.)   7.5, Juxtaposition. Juxtaposition is defined as the ordering of phrases
or clauses where there is no marking to show their relationship
grammatically. There are at least two types of juxtaposition, that of verb
phrases and that of noun phrases.
   Juxtaposition of verb phrases is used to indicate a series of events in
sequence all performed by the same subject. These verb phrases may
consist of optional objects and may contain compound verbs © but there
is no subject and no tense or person marking on the verbs. Illustration
(344) has these juxtaposed verb phrases bracketed.",[129]
"   4.8. Genitive constructions. Barasano uses the case marker ya (genitive)
to express ownership. It is generally used in referring expressions, and occurs
between the possessor and the possessed, e.g., Hdibe ya-wi (Jim GEN-house)
‘Jim’s house.’ The possessor is usually a pronoun, e.g., 7 ya-wi (3ms GEN-house)
‘his house’ or so ya-papera-tuti (3fs GEN-paper-stack) ‘her book’. The possessor
precedes the possessed unless the possessed is topicalized in which case it is
fronted. In illustration (163), ya (genitive) follows the head which is topicalized.(163) hie             i    ya-gu
       hammock        3ms GEN-hammock
       his long hammock   There is a plural genitive form ye, e.g., bas-a ye sita (human-p GENp land)
‘the people’s land’. With plural inanimate referents (as well as for
nonindividuated items), ye (genitive plural) occurs without a classifier
suffix, e.g., ida ye ‘their things’.!8
   Notions like part-whole and kinship relationship are expressed by putting
the possessor directly before the possessed. To indicate the possession of
body parts, a noun or pronoun is directly followed by the term for the
body part, e.g., Haibe abo ‘Jim’s hand’ or i 4bo ‘his hand’. The form -wi
‘house’ !9 may also occur without the genitive marker, e.g., Haibe wi ‘Tim’s
house’. Kinship terms are obligatorily preceded by a noun or pronoun
which refers to the person so related and which directly precedes the
kinship term, e.g., Haibe yike ‘Jim’s grandfather’, or i yikw ‘his grandfather’.",[79]
"
                        4.7-4.8 Noun-noun stractures   Barasano forms noun-noun structures by compounding and by use of the
case marker ya (genitive). Because of the classifier system and few independent
nouns, Barasano does not have many noun-noun structures.
Noun    Phrase                                                                                 61
   4.7, Compound nouns. Compound nouns are rare, undoubtedly due to
the productiveness of combining a noun and classifier to form a referring
expression. In the few that occur, the first noun attributes characteristics
or properties and the second provides the reference. For example, wai-sotu
‘fish pot’ (pot refers to the method of cooking), bode-kiibua (dragonfly
canoe) ‘helicopter’ and hea-guso (fire alligator) ‘cayman’.","[78, 79]"

    Studies in the Languages of Colombia 2    Publications in Linguistics Number               101      Barasano        Syntax   is   the   second    in     a   series    of   studies   of
    Colombian languages produced by SIL members under the
    tutelage of Dr. David Weber at a workshop held for that purpose
    in the fall of 1984. The series is edited by Dr. Paul Frank, who
    also authored the first volume of the series—Ika Syntax.
       These sketches are based on a typological, functional
    perspective which provides an excellent framework for writing
    broadly useful, descriptive grammars. Linguists and nonlinguists
    alike can derive a helpful understanding of what these languages
    are like without the heavy demands of a rigorously theoretical
    orientation.
       Barasana is a member of the eastern Tucanoan language family
    and is closely related to Taiwano. However, the Barasana and
    Taiwana people are of different ancestry and thus form two
    distinct social groups. These peoples live in southeastern
    Colombia just above the equator along the Piraparand River and,
    at the present time, number about 250 speakers.
      Wendell Jones and Paula Jones have worked with the Barasana
    and   Taiwana      since   March      of 1977   under       the     auspices   of the
    Summer Institute of Linguistics and the ministry of Government
    of Colombia. They concentrated on studying three closely related
    dialects, collecting the data which is the basis for the analysis
    found in this volume.

"   1.11. Summary. A review of this section shows that Barasano fits the
pattern for ov languages. Accordingly, (a) it is a suffixing language; (b)
there are only postpositions (no prepositions); (c) in noun phrases, the
genitive precedes the head; (d) auxiliary verbs follow the main verb; and
(e) modals are verb suffixes. Although there is variation in the order of
descriptive modifiers (for pragmatic reasons), the typical order is that the
modifier precedes the head. There are no relative clauses,

   1.12, Phonemes. Barasano has 23 phonemes: eleven consonants and
twelve vowels which are presented in (35) and (36). Vowels are of six
qualities, each with its nasalized counterpart (indicated by a tilde). The
symbols used here and throughout the examples represent a modified

words from Spanish or another Tucanoan language.","[26, 27]"
"   4.6. Numerals. Numerals occur with suffixes which generally refer to an
implicit head. When they occur with the head noun, they may precede or
follow it. When they follow it, we contend that the head noun is
topicalized or in some type of special focus. Thus comparing illustration
(159) with (160), (160) is considered a noun phrase where the head is in
focus.(159) hua-rahe       — kGbe-rahe-ri
       two-cylinder metal-cylinder-p
       two metal cans(160) géta-hai               hua-hai
      stone-flat*thin        two-flat“thin
       two stone slabs  In some cases, a numeral plus a classifier may function as a noun. For
example, the classifier -r#bu ‘day’ functions as a noun yet does not occur
by itself, e.g., idia-raébu ‘three days’ in (161).  ""pahetidi (J) / gaheyetidi (E)

      three-day be-INFER--3p 3fs house leave-NEG--PROXEs
      For three days she remained in the house without leaving,   With animate nouns, numerals agree in number and gender. A list of
numerals for animate nouns is given in (162). The gender suffixes -x
(masculine), and -o (feminine) follow all the numbers except hxa ‘two’ and
idia ‘three’ which are the only numbers marked with -r4 (plural). If a group
is mixed according to gender, the -# (masculine) suffix is used. Number-
agreement marking with numerals is strictly adhered to for animate nouns,
e.g., hua-rd (two-anp) ‘two living things’.(162) sig-u/o             ‘one-(m/f’
      hua-ra              “two-(anp)’
      idia-ra             ‘three-(anp)’
      babarirak-u/o       “four-(m/fy’
      kohobékarak-ulo     ‘five-(m/f’
      kohobékarak-u       —‘five-(mf’   With inanimate nouns numerals agree in class and number. For example,
the number Awa ‘two’ followed by the class marker -hdi ‘flat, thin objects’
produces the hxahdi ‘two flat, thin objects’, which may modify any object
in the -hdi class, e.g., hua-hai sudi-hai (two-flat“thin cloth-flat“thin) ‘two
pieces of cloth’.
   The number ‘one’ has a different form when referring to inanimate
nouns. The inanimate form is koho-, e.g., koho-raibu ‘one day’.
   By contrast to animate nouns, for which number agreement is rigidly
adhered   to, with inanimate   nouns      there is a certain amount   of variation:
hua ‘two’ is rarely marked as plural, idia ‘three’ is optionally marked as
plural, and numbers above four are usually marked as plural. For example,
‘two days’ is huwa-rébu (two-day); ‘three days’ may be idia-réibu (three-day)
or idia-réibu-ri (three-day-p); and ‘four days’ is babari-rébu-ri (four-day-p).","[77, 78]"

                              Foreword  Colombia, land of E] Dorado, land of gold and emeralds! But even more
precious are the gems found—not beneath its soil—but within its
indigenous languages. Among these gems I would count the auxiliary verb
system of Kogi, the positional verbs of Ika, the compound verbs of Epena,
the evidential systems of Tucanoan languages, as well as their noun
classifier systems.
   For ten weeks in the fall of 1984, it was my privilege to lead a workshop,
guiding several si. colleagues in writing grammar sketches from a
typological and functional perspective. What began as mere ‘sketches’ have
become valuable grammars, and now with the publication of the second of
these, we must acknowledge the authors’ success.
   The following impress me as the most significant reasons why this project
yielded such rich fruit:
     1. The typological/functional perspective provided an excellent
framework   for writing—as   was   our     intention—broad,   useful,   descriptive
grammars. Linguists and nonlinguists alike should be able to derive from
them an accurate and fairly complete picture of what these languages are
like, without the prerequisites that a more theoretical approach would
have demanded.
     2. All of the participants brought to the workshop an extensive
knowledge of the language, acquired through months or years of study,
and (with some exceptions) an exhaustive morpheme concordance of texts
collected in their fieldwork. These slip concordances served as sources of
examples, insights, and challenging ‘residue’. And each participant brought
                                         xiii
 xiv                                                            Barasano Syntax a terrific amount of energy, expended in long hours writing drafts at a very
 arduous pace.
     3. At the beginning of the workshop, the authors were given a very
 general outline, and for each language, the corresponding files (empty
 except for the headings) were created on the disk in the computer center.
 The authors worked ‘on-line’, adding descriptive text and examples under
 the various headings, all the while refining and modifying the initial outline
 to fit the structure of the language being described. Consequently, there is
 some commonality to the structure of the various grammars, but without
 the negative effects of ‘squeezing’ the descriptions into a fixed,
 predetermined outline. (Mark Nelson and Bob Reed made the
 environment for working on-line very congenial.)
     4,In addition to writing grammars, Paul Frank and Grace Hensarling
 served as consultants-in-training to other authors. Other linguists
 contributed occasional suggestions, most worthy of mention being Janet
 Barnes, Terry Malone, and Bob Reed.
      5. At the end of the workshop, there were drafts of most sections of
  the grammars. Obviously, a terrific amount of work has been done since
  that time to bring these up to their current form. The person most
‘-responsible for keeping alive the vision of seeing them finished and
  published is Paul Frank; without his carrying the torch, they might never
  have seen the light of day.
       6. Finally, if these grammars   are a source of delight, it is because   the
 languages they describe are marvelous objects, reflecting the creativity both
 of the One who gave language to Man and of the speakers who—in using
 language—continually shape it to serve their purposes in their
 environment.

                               Introduction  Barasano and Taiwano! are closely related languages of the Eastern
Tucanoan family. The Taiwana people are of different ancestry than the
Barasana, and thus a distinct social group. It is upon this basis that the two
groups may intermarry.
  These peoples live in southeastern Colombia just above the equator
along the Piraparana river at approximately six to seven hundred feet
above sea level. The rivers are, for the most part, not navigable and thus
it has been one of the more isolated areas of the department of the
Vaupés.
   Barasano and Taiwano are now spoken by about 250 people. These two
groups were once much more numerous. Today there remain five distinct
subgroups among the Barasana and at least four among the Taiwana. The
people disagree as to the naming of their various groups, making an
organized listing virtually impossible (Hugh-Jones 1979:282-85). This
confusion may be the result of their not wanting others to know too much
about their own group. Hence, in many cases the names given a group
have been given by other groups rather than by members of the group
itself. Also some names that have survived began as the way one group
disparagingly referred to another.","[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"    A   noun    may   take        inflectional       suffixes   to indicate     case    or discourse
features and derivational suffixes to form other nouns. In the first instance,
note (22), where -b4 (contrastive focus) indicates that the speaker is
excluding himself in the sense that others may do such things but he does
not. In (23), a new noun is formed from wii ‘house’ by adding the
derivational suffix -a (pertaining to) plus -g# (masculine singular) to mean
a man in relation to a house.(22)    yi-be-a-ha                yu-ba

what appear to be restricting clauses are simply nominalizations in
apposition to the head noun. In illustration (24), sigo ‘one female’ appears
to be the head of the supposed relative clause ida réka buego ‘who studies
with them’. However, the restricting clause may occur in the sentence
without sigo and be grammatically acceptable. See §11.4-7, for more on
this topic.(24)    sig-o         idi.        raka    bue-go          yu-re abo-a-b6          SO

modifier follows the standard of comparison. In (25), i gage ‘his older
brother’ is the standard, followed by the comparative descriptive modifier
rétoro haige ‘bigger than’. An alternative reading is seen in (26) where the
adverb réto ‘to surpass’ is incorporated into the verb, along with some
changes of subject and person markers.(25)   i       gag-u                réto-ro            hai-gae   = ya-a-bi

"   2.1, Nouns. Nouns in Barasano fill the roles of subject, object, benefactive,
location, time, manner, and instrument. They are divided into eight classes with
the most basic division being animate vs. inanimate. Animate nouns are
subdivided depending on their inflection for gender and number. These classes
are reflected in verb agreement with the class of the subject.
   Class 1 nouns are inanimate nouns and may end in any vowel; a few
examples are hidobu ‘cassava squeezer’, ktibua ‘canoe’, ruhabedo ‘ring’, and
wii ‘house’. Inanimate nouns are inflected for class and number. Classifiers
generally describe the shape of the object. For example, -h4j ‘flat, thin
object’ is a classifier which joins with kébe ‘metal’ to form the inanimate
noun kébe-hdi ‘machete’, and which may be pluralized with the suffix -ri,
e.g., kdbe-hai-ri ‘machetes’.
   Class 2 nouns are animate nouns which are unspecified as to their
gender and number; these must be inflected with gender-number suffixes.
For example, hak- ‘parent’, when inflected with -# (masculine singular)
becomes hak- ‘father’, when inflected with -o (feminine singular) becomes
hak-o ‘mother’, and when inflected with -wa (plural) becomes hak-ua
‘parents’. Other examples of this class are gaw-x/-o/-a ‘male, female, plural

plural sibling’. Domesticated cats and chickens also belong to this class.
   Class three consists of nouns which are only plural. There are only two
words in this class, bésa (animate group) and ria ‘children’, e.g., 7 bésa ‘he
and those with him’. Neither of these two nouns occurs in the singular. To
refer to a child, one switches to bak-#/-o (progeny-ms/s) ‘son or daughter’.
   Class four consists of nouns which refer to animates which do not have
any gender marking. The nouns of this class are mostly animals. In the
singular,    they   trigger   masculine,   third   person,   verb     inflection,   unless   -o
(feminine singular) is added to the word, or the word rdbio ‘female’ is
added to modify the noun causing it to refer to a female. Examples are
wekw ‘tapir’, weko ‘parrot’, habo ‘armadillo’, yai ‘wild cat/dog’, and yese
‘pig’. In order to speak of a female pig, one may say yese-o ‘female pig’.
   Class five consists of nouns which are only masculine. This class has
nouns referring to kinship relationships and religious offices which are held
only by men. Examples are biaga ‘shaman who protects those performing
initiation rites’, hakoarébe      ‘father-in-law’, and baya         ‘dance leader’.
  Class six is comprised of nouns which are only feminine. These refer to
kinship relations. Examples are békaho ‘aunt’, dsibo ‘husband’s sister’ and
hého ‘son’s wife’. (Note that these all end in -o.)
  Class seven consists of only one word, siika ‘baby’. It is not inflected for
gender      but may    be referred    to through     the verb   as either masculine          or
feminine depending on the sex of the child.
   Class eight refers to speech act participants. This class consists of the
pronouns y# (is), y#a (1x), badi (1i), ba (2s), and bia (2p). Kinship terms may
also be used when referring to the second person along with one of the
above pronouns. When one of these pronouns occurs as subject, the verb
takes the nonthird-person-animate marking, except in certain tenses (see
§6.1).
   Nouns may be pluralized in various ways. The prototypical marker for
animate nouns is -a (plural, animate) which serves to signal animacy in
nouns which have no gender marking in the singular, e.g., ydko ‘star
(animate, assumed masculine)’ becomes ydko-a ‘stars’.
   Nouns which refer to collections are inherently plural and require a
singularizing suffix to refer to a single member. For example, the animate
noun ia ‘caterpillars’ refers to a collection of caterpillars. In order to refer
to a single caterpillar one says ia-b# (caterpillars-s) ‘caterpillar’, The
inanimate noun oho ‘bananas’ occurs with -ro ‘singularizer’ to refer to a
single banana, i.e., oho-ro ‘banana’.
   The pluralizer for nearly all inanimate nouns is; -ri (plural, inanimate),
€.g., sott-ri ‘pots’. Besides a plural form, many inanimate nouns have a

For example, kibua ‘canoe’ has the plural form kdbuari ‘canoes’ and the
general, nonspecific form kébu ‘canoes’. In a context where the speaker
alludes to a group travelling by canoes without focusing on the number of
canoes, he may employ the nonspecific form.
  In addition to nouns as described above, the language relies heavily on
deverbal      nouns, which        are also subdivided         into two groups, animate          and
inanimate.
   Animate deverbal nouns are formed by adding a gender-number suffix to a
verb, e.g., bda-go (work-ts) ‘female worker’; or by adding -ri (participle) to the
verb plus b&s-#/-o/-a (human-n/-/-p) to form agentive nominalizations, e.g.,
béa-ri bas-o (work-prceL human-fs) ‘working woman’,
   Inanimate deverbal nouns require a participial following the verb root, e.g.,
we-ri-ka (fly-prcpL-hollow) ‘airplane’; or they may be formed by adding general
nominalizers, e.g., wit-se (fly-Nom) ‘flying things (airplanesy’.”","[37, 38, 39]"
"  Possessive. The possessive clause may be formed with ya ‘to be’ or
ba/badi ‘to not be’. In these cases, the possessor is encoded as an object.
For example, in (340) and (341), yw (1s) is encoded as an object.(340) hai-ro        yd-a-ha—s            tis yut-re

"
   BAn exception to this is in the case of subordinate clauses which link with preceding
sentences or are used in switching topics. In such cases -ri (participle) most frequently occurs
with bahi ‘to be’ and seems to refer to the situation in general (event or state-oriented
rather than subject-oriented).

object.

                                     2.11-2.15     Pronouns
     Barasano pronouns are subdivided into personal, reflexive, interrogative,
and demonstrative pronouns.
Parts of Speech                                                                               31   2.11. Personal pronouns. A personal pronoun is very often a noun phrase
in the subject position and is used in the noun phrase to enhance definiteness.
Personal    pronouns       distinguish     first, second,   and   third person,   and   singular
versus plural. They also distinguish between first person plural inclusive and
exclusive. In the third person singular there is an animate/inanimate distinction
as well as separate forms for masculine and feminine. All of these pronouns are
given in (91).(91)   yu           (1s)                 ya-a     (Ix)

       ti           (3in)  2.12. Reflexive pronouns. Reflexive pronouns are formed                          by adding
basu ‘self’ to the personal pronouns, e.g., f basu ‘himself’.","[48, 49]"
"   In (280) -koa (fulfillment) occurs with the durative construction (verb
plus yd ‘to be’) in order to indicate the fulfillment of an expectation. In
this case, the reality is the opposite of the expectation implied by the use
of the concessionary clause, viz., that ‘I’ will no longer care for the house,
   40in related languages, this type of contraexpectation is expressed as a distinct morpheme.
In Macuna the morphemes are -k4, which has been glossed ‘emphatic’ and -k6, which has
been glossed “completive’.

   184 Jess common way of expressing the genitive plural is by following ye (genitive plural)
with the noun to which it refers, e.g, ida ye sita (3p GENp land) ‘their land’. Also, at least in
one dialect of Janerd, it is acceptable to simply stale the possessor prior to the possessed
(without ya), e.g.,: 7 fie ‘his hammock’,
   19.wi ‘house’ is not written as suffixed to proper nouns and pronouns (our own bias). wii
‘house’ is the word used when it is not suffixed to a noun.

possessed elements, a gender-number suffix is used: -# (masculine), -o
(feminine), and -r4 (plural). The /a/ in ya (genitive) is dropped when followed
by -# (masculine singular) and -o (feminine singular). For inanimate possessed
elements, a classifier suffix is used. The possessor is generally a personal
pronoun. The phrases so formed, like the following, refer back to some
previously-mentioned animate, possessed beings:”(164)          —y-w

is to say that there is a single set of roots which may take either regular
verbal inflection and serve as predicates, or may take nominalizers,
participials, and classifiers, and serve as modifiers in noun phrases. A
descriptive noun phrase is formed by a stative verb, (e.g., bai ‘be bad, ugly’,
boti ‘be white’, yoa ‘be long’, hai ‘be big, many, kéda ‘be good’, etc.’)
followed by either:
   1. A gender-number marker or nominalizer, e.g., kéda-go (be*good-ts)
      ‘good woman’ and kéda-se (be“good-Nom) ‘good stuff; or
   2. A participle and a classifier or, for humans,         the word bés- ‘human’
      plus gender-number marker, e.g., keda-ri-bedo (be good-prcrt-ring)
      ‘a nice ring’ and sia-ri bas-w (kill-prcepL human-ms) ‘a man who kills’.
   A head noun is not required, as in (171), where both modifiers are used
as referring expressions to the implicit head noun sudi-hdi (cloth-flat*thin)
‘cloth’.(171) sta-ri-hdi                 yoa-ri-hai              abo-a-ha       yee

       He doesn’t want her (lit. He wants not her).",[147]
"  4.3. Classifiers added to noun      heads of noun      phrases.   Some     classifi-
ers occur with nouns causing the noun to refer to a slightly different thing.
For example, in (153), note the slight change of meaning when the
classifiers -hdi ‘flat, thin’ and -16 ‘a hanging bunch’ are added to nouns.(153) sudi ‘clothing’     -hai ‘flat, thin’            sudi-hai ‘cloth’
      wii ‘house’         -hai ‘flat, thin’            wii-hai ‘shelter’
      wai ‘fish’          -t6 ‘a hanging bunch’        wai-t6 ‘string of fish’
      oho ‘bananas’       -t6 ‘a hanging bunch’        oho-té ‘bunch of bananas’   Some nouns need classifiers in order to serve as referring expressions,
e.g., kibu ‘kind of tree’, hi- ‘kind of basket’ and ruha (semantically empty
noun).(154) hi      -bx ‘hollow cylinder’        Ai-bw ‘deep basket’
      ruha_   -bedo ‘ring’                 ruha-bedo ‘a ring-shaped thing’   Some nouns are more attributive than inherently referential. With such
nouns, the classifier functions more as the referring element, with the noun
modifying it. Note that wehu-bo ‘shallow basket made of wah reed’ in
(155) does not refer to a reed (the referent of the noun) but to a thing of
the type indicated by the classifier, to which wuhx ‘type of reed’ is
attributed.

         béka ‘ant’         -bo ‘dome’          béka-bo ‘ant hill   4.4, The nominal ruha. The semantically empty noun ruha is used with
classifiers to refer to an object without naming the object itself. The
classifier, then, supplies the referential properties of the resulting noun,
e.g., tuha-a ‘hollowed-out object, object with hole’. In the case where two
features are known, a suffix indicating design would follow the nominal
ruha and that suffix would then bear the classifier, e.g., ruha-piru-ro
(Q-striped-cL) ‘striped thing’ which could be used when referring to a
striped towel.","[75, 76]"
"  When -o (causative) is suffixed to intransitive verbs, the subject of the
verb becomes the object of the causative and when it is definite, is marked
with -re, as in (180).
   >2kuuti ‘to have’ does not conform to the general pattern of nominalized verbs in that -ri
(participle) does not follow it, preceding the suffixed nominalizer/classifier. Also, some
speakers drop the -# in ket when          nominalizing it with animate nominalizers. E.g., ku-ku
‘one who has’.

dahu ‘cassava bread’ is the direct object, and so ‘she’ is the benefactee and
both are marked with -ve. (For further discussion on causatives see $6.8).(181) dahu-re             so-re    base-yu-hu             i

"  2.9. Modifiers in noun phrases. Barasano is a verb-adjective language.
The verbal equivalent of a modifying adjective is a predicate verb in a
nonrelative construction. That is, a single set of roots may take either
regular verbal inflection and serve as predicates, or may take nominalizers,
participials, and classifiers and serve as modifiers in noun phrases.
Compare (84), in which buti ‘to be hard’ serves as a modifier with (85), in
which it serves as a predicate.(84)   kébe      buti-be-ti-re                        hua-yu-hara                ida

       hard-NEG-PRES--3          3in
       It isn’t hard.",[47]
"   Classifiers are added to the nominalizers for nonspecific items to make
them refer to single inanimate items. Following are examples of the
classifier -b used with the various tenses—present, past conjecture tense
(speaker did not see him weave the basket), far-past witnessed tense
(speaker saw him weave the basket), and future.(473)         — sua-ri-but

         the basket he will weave   Among the numerous classifiers, two general classifiers, -# (classifier for
trees, torsos, hammocks, nets and mountains), and -a (classifier for hollow
objects, objects with holes, spherical objects and appendages) are preceded
by -k in the present tense. For example, compare (477) with (478) and
(479),66(477) i    —sbitha-ri-ku
      3ms ascend vertically-prcpL-tree
      the tree he is ascending(478) i          bitha-ri-i

         3ms     ascend vertically-far* pst-NOM-PROX-tree~PRES
         the tree he ascended (I saw his ascent)  11.7, Nominalizations in apposition. There seem to be no relative
clauses in Barasano just as there are no relative pronouns. What might
normally appear to be a relative clause is analyzed as a nominalized clause
in apposition to a noun, pronoun, proper name, or noun phrase in a
subject position. Or the nominalized clause may occur in apposition to an
object as a kind of modifier, or with a free noun form used as a classifier.
In each case, the nominalization alone can carry the meaning which is
understood with or without the noun or phrase to which it refers.
Examples of this phenomena follow.
    Illustration (480) appears to have a relative clause following the head
noun Aix ‘hammock’. The problem with such an analysis is that the clause   661 (478), -ria + -# becomes -rii. The dropping of the consonant also occurs for
nominalizer -g# (masculine singular). Thus béha-ria-n can refer to ‘one who ascended
vertically’. To a few speakers -ria + -u becomes -riz. Also, in (479), -fi + -4# becomes -tii.
150                                                               Barasano Syntaxis nominalized and nominalizations may occur in the absence of a head
noun. We have already shown that nonfinite verbs may have -ri (participle)
followed by a classifier to form nominalizations in which the nominalizer
refers to a specific item. Thus, the head noun Ad# ‘hammock’ does not
need to be in the sentence to make it grammatically acceptable. Where the
topic of hammock has already been established there is no need for
beginning the sentence with haw and the natural way of stating (480) is
seen in (481).(480) hit        6      kahi-ri-ke            &bo-a-ha                 ye

      there hang-prcpL-hammock     want-PRES--3 1s
      I want that hammock which is hanging there.","[166, 167, 168]"
"  Fulfillment. The aspect of fulfillment expressed by -kod includes both
completive aspect (defined here as viewing an event from its end point),
as well as the related idea of fulfillment of an expectation. The illustrations
below show first of all the completive aspect with -koa, followed by a
discussion of the fulfillment aspect.
   In (271), -koa (fulfillment) is followed by -7i (sequential participle) with
the motion verb wa ‘to move’. Here the sense is that the act of going is
completed, which in this case, means that the participants arrived.(271) gahe-ro-hu                     wa-koa-ri,              ya-a-ba        ida

       Having gone to and arrived at another place, they live there.",[110]
"  Such verb phrases also occur with ia ‘to see’ and eka ‘to feed’. When the
participant’s gaze is perceived as changing location, it may simply be a
change in direction such as ia two (see return“caus) ‘to look back’; or a
change in the goal as with ia hd (see enter*room*caus) ‘to look into a
room’.45 The verb eka, with a causative suffix, may be preceded by various
other verb roots to signify ‘to cause to receive’. In such cases, the subject
commits an implicit action which causes him to receive the action stated by
the verbal complement and committed by the nominal preceding it as in
(313).(313) kotibaha toa        eko-yu-hu             sO

"  4.5. Quantifiers. Quantifiers may occur with or without a noun head
and are inflected for animacy. The marker for animate is -ra as in ha-ra
(be*many-anp) ‘many’, and for inanimate is -ro as in hai-ro (big-Nom) ‘much,
many’.!6 Exceptionally, siguri ‘few, some’ has what is generally an inanimate
pluralizer -ri following sig-# (one*an-ms) ‘one animate male’.
  In the list of quantifiers in (156), note that several end with -aka,
(diminutive), and -k6é ‘to count’. The form -ka is perhaps -k6 where the 6
has become 4 when preceding raka ‘with’. (There is some idiolectal
variation in the use of quantifiers.)(156)             Animate                                    Inanimate

constitute ‘the few.
   In cases where quantifiers modify nouns they generally occur before the

                          Parts of Speech  This chapter briefly discusses the major grammatical categories of
Barasano, beginning with the open classes of nouns, verbs, modifiers in
noun phrases, and adverbs; and ending with the closed classes of
pronouns, other proforms, noun adjuncts, verb adjuncts, conjunctions,
interjections, and negators.","[35, 36, 37]"
"   Sentence (285) is a similar example with the imperative mood. In this
case -koa (fulfillment) relates the command to ‘swallow the medicine’ to
the child’s act of resisting (with the expectation that he will avoid
swallowing it).
96                                                                          Barasano Syntax(285) yu-kod-ya

                    IMPV
      Swallow (it)!","[113, 114]"
"  These examples indicate that the nasality of -be (negative) is conditioned
not by the preceding morpheme, but by the following one.
  A second example of nasalization spreading to the left is when personal
pronouns are used to form indefinite and demonstrative pronouns. The
personal pronouns are 7 (3ms), so® (3fs), and id4 (3p). These are added to the
indefinite nominal gahe ‘other’ to form gahi ‘another male’, gaheo ‘another
female’ and gahéra ‘others’, respectively. Notice that the nasality of the
personal pronoun determines the nasality of the resultant indefinite
pronoun, even though the personal pronoun derivative occurs at the end
of the word. The same pattern occurs with the demonstrative pronouns.
The nominal adi ‘this’ fuses with the personal pronouns to form 4d ‘this
male’ and adio ‘this female’; ado ‘this place’ becomes 4dda ‘these beings’.
(adi ‘this’ is used for a highly specific thing or place whereas ado ‘this’ is
used for a more general area or in reference to manner.)   1.16. Glottal stop. Sentences which end with pronouns (e.g., ye (1s)), the
adverb kéda ‘again’, the discourse marker ya (yuha (£)) ‘now’, or the
sentence fragment #hax ‘yes’, may optionally occur with a final glottal stop.
We regard this phenomenon as outside the segmental phonology, and have
thus not listed the glottal stop as a phoneme.",[34]
"   It is used to highlight distance removed (in time or space). For example,
in (198), -h# marks the participant 7 (3ms) who has just disappeared from
the scene.

"   11.4, Nominalizations not bound by time. The nominalizers which refer
to general or nonspecific items and beings are the same as those listed in (122)
in chapter 3. They occur immediately following the verb and indicate animacy
and number. The animate nominalizers distinguish masculine, feminine and
plural—see (439).       The inanimate nominalizers -ro/-do/-to are used for
quantities, places, times and manner—see (440)-(442); -ro may also be used
immediately following a verb root to refer to a single but general object—see
142                                                                Barasano Syntax(443); and it may be used for referring to either the subject or nonsubject. For
example,       with     the nominalization giiba-ro (wrap*around“oneself-NoM)
‘something to wrap around oneself -ro refers to the nonsubject item that might
be used to do the wrapping (not the wrapper). However with the time word
yoa-ro (long-NoM) -ro refers to the subject ‘time’.(439) béa-gu

when the nominalization is the subject of the verb—see (444)-(446); -re
with a nominalization which is anything other than the subject of the
verb—see (447)-(448); they are also used to refer to nonindividuated items

subject of the action, see (449)-(451).(444) kati-se

      (experiences in) living  The nominalizations used for referring to specific items or persons all
contain -ri (participle) immediately following the verb, followed by either
another nominalizer, a noun, a gender-number marker, or a classifier. This
is used for both animate and inanimate—see (452)-(453), with animate
humans the nominal bas- ‘human’ is required following -ri. Nominalizers
which follow -ri are -ro and -se (depending on the dialect). The subject of
the verb may be a noun or pronoun preceding the nominalization which is
not marked for subject—see (454). Nominalizations which refer to items or
persons that are anything other than the subject of the verb have -a
(nonsubject nominalizer) following -ri (participle)—see (455)-(456). © A
special case where one animate is referred to as being food for another
   8249 (classifier for many manufactured items) may be used both as a nominalizer
referring to the subject or nonsubject of the verb, e.g, wea-ri-to (paddle-PTCPL-made“thing)
‘a paddle’ and kéda-ri-to (good-PTCPL-made“thing) ‘a nice paddle’.

   11.5, Negated nominalizers not bound by time. Negation takes a differ-
ent form for nominalizers which refer to the subject of the verb versus those
which refer to nonsubject.
   When referring to the subject of the verb, -be (negative) is used. It
follows the verb root and precedes a nonproximate nominalizer. For
animates the nonproximate nominalizers are -k¢# (masculine singular), -ko
  63]n the singular constructions -a (nonsubject) is dropped, ie. /ri + a + o/ becomes /rio/
and /ri +     a + w/ becomes /-ri/. This is also the case for inanimates which have -# as a
classifier.
Subordination                                                                           145
(feminine singular) and -da (ananimate plural)—see (458). For inanimates
the nonproximate nominalizer is ti, This is the negative counterpart of -se
(nominalizer). Thus, when -fi occurs alone (with no noun or pronoun
preceding it to indicate subject), it refers to the subject of the negated
verb, For example, the positive form with the stative verb aba ‘to be soft’
is aba-se ‘that which is soft’ and the negated form is seen in (459). A
classifier follows -ti for nominalizations which refer to specific man-made
items as in (460).(458) buha-be-ko

      hard-NEG-NOM-PROX-Ting
      a ring that is not hard   When referring to anything but the subject, the negated form of the
general nominalizer is -a (nonsubject), followed by the negative verb ba
‘not be’, which is inflected by the animate nominalizers -gw (masculine
singular), -go (feminine singular), -dé (animate plural), and the inanimate
nominalizer di. Examples of this are (461) and (462), where the latter
refers to those animals which are not food, nor used for anything. (For

to a specific time are formed from verbs (unmarked for gender-number)
by suffixing a tense-evidential suffix, a nominalizer, and in some cases a
classifier. The tense-evidential markers are listed in (463).","[159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"
"   When listing participants present at some event, often yd ‘to be’ follows
each participant and has no switch referent marker. In this case, however,
the final verb ya ‘to be’ refers to all of the participants of the list as in
(436).",[158]
"
                               4.1-4.4 Noun     classifiers  Barasano has an extensive system of noun classifiers, which provide
concordance (agreement) within the noun phrase, and are used to form
referring expressions that head noun phrases.
  Note examples (139)-(141) which illustrate agreement in the noun
phrase. In (139), -# (classifier for hammock) is the classifier added to hxa
‘two’ (the -a is dropped) which agrees with the object hii# () / hiiuge (Ee)
‘hammock’, In (140), -ga ‘hollow/having a hole’ is the classifier added to ya
(genitive) to agree with the noun kiébua ‘canoe’. In (141) -ka ‘hollow,
having a hole’ is the classifier added to the deverbal nominal hai-busa-ri
which agrees with wewo (specie of reed) (whose singularizer is -a ‘hollow,
having a hole’).",[67]
"  7.4. Locationals.       Predicate       nominative,   locative,   existential,   and
possessive clauses often share the same constituents in many languages.
This is true in Barasano, where all of these sentence types share the same
verb, yd ‘to be’ and its negative counterpart ba/badi ‘to not be’. The
possessive construction may also occur with the verb kzti/ku#to ‘to have’.",[127]
"   11,20. Verb for commands. The verb roti ‘to order or request’ is used with
infinitival verbs as complements or with a verbal complement. When used with
an infinitive to express ‘in order to’, the subject of the infinitive is the same as
the object of roti which is marked by -re (object). The order is object/subject,
infinitive (embedded verb), and roti ‘to order or request’—see (527), The
embedded verb may have its own object in which case it also is marked with
-re (object) as in (528). Note the negated form of roti in (529) signifying ‘to
order not to’.(527) i-re   kéda_  roti-gu-a-ku      yd-a-ha_      yet

"   Causativized verbs showing the resultant state frequently follow other
uninflected verbs, which indicate the means employed to cause the
resultant state of the object. For example, in (311), the subject pounds
down the toucan he cut up with the result that it becomes soft (in this
case, edible). And in (312), in order to cause another person to enter a
house, s6 ‘to cause to enter’ is preceded by the means used to make the
person enter, i.e., by calling.(311) rase    i   yihe-re-re__roka        abo-ka-bi

      3ms-O summon enter ~CAUS-INFER-3p   3p
      They summoned him into (the house).",[120]
"   The flow from more important to less important information may also be
marked by ridé ‘only, just’ in which the sense of -dé (spacer) appears to be
inherent. This word is used for conveying no change in a situation or
event, or for conveying the limit of number of persons or things. In (560),
ridé occurs in a recapping of the description of what the formerly dead
husband said when he arrived again at the house.” (See also §12.8.)
  PThe -hua (selective focus) in ria-hua-re-bd is used to show that there is a switch in
participants, in this instance in the objective case (marked       by -re) and followed by -b4
(contrastive focus) which signifies that what was done to the previously mentioned object is
not done to this object. -b4@ (contrastive focus) and -dé (spacer) are mutually exclusive.
Sentence (554) is similar. The effect of using -dé (spacer) is to highlight ‘meat’, the food
referred to in (553) which was not good food for humans,
   The presence of ridé following i ‘he’ in (557) is similar to the use of dé in (554) as it
highlights ‘him’ over against ‘she made the good juices for’.

                              11.2-11.3    Switch    reference   Switch reference of the subject is expressed either by overt markers or by no
markers. In the second case, the construction is pragmatically interpreted by the
hearer based on the lexical content of the verbs and the general context. The
overt markers are employed only with adverbial clauses.",[156]
"  12.1. Subject ellipsis. Subject ellipsis may occur in either main clauses
or subordinate clauses. In main clauses, the listener is left to pragmatically
determine   the    referent,    which   is usually   unambiguous    because     of    the
context. In subordinate clauses, subject ellipsis is in most cases obligatory
when the subject is the same as that of the main clause, with the verb of
the subordinate clause marked for agreement of gender and number.
However,    when    there    are a series   of subordinate   clauses,   only   the   first
verb may be marked, and in some cases, none at all. (See §11.1.)
  Subject ellipsis in subordinate clauses is illustrated in (533)-(535). In
(533), the subordinate clause guhi bagu yari ‘because (he) has no teeth’ has
no explicit subject and this indicates that the subject of the subordinate
clause is the subject of the main clause. The main verb of the subordinate

subject of the main clause. In illustration (534) there is marking for gender-
number on the first subordinate clause but the following subordinate
clauses have no inflection on the verbs. Again there is no explicit subject
in the subordinate clauses and this indicates that the subject ye ‘T is the
same as that of the main clause. In illustration (535) there is neither an
explicit subject nor gender-number marking in the subordinate clauses,
again indicating that the subject of the subordinate clauses is subject of the
main clause at the end of the sentence.(533) guhi   ba-gu      ya-ri    buto        bohodé-a-bi                                       i

"  Barasano also has lexical causative verbs derived historically from
morphological causatives. Compare the following transitive verbs with their
intransitive counterparts: ked6 ‘to fix or make’, keda ‘to be good’; wuo ‘to
cause to be mixed’, wusa ‘to be mixed’; tuo ‘to cause to return’, tedi ‘to
return’; fo ‘to show’, fa ‘to see’; and sé ‘to cause to enter’, saha ‘to enter’.“4
   In causative constructions, the causee (the subject of the embedded
verb), when present, is marked by -re (object), Thus, the causative of a
transitive verb may have two objects (both potentially marked by -re), (See
§5.1-5.3 on the case marker -re.) Note that the direct object of the
causativized clause precedes the causee.  44/8ha + of becomes /s6/,

"   4.2. Compound classifiers. In some instances two classifiers may occur
on a noun to form a compound classifier, each of which may occur alone.
For example, compare uye-godo-a (oil-cleared“out-hollow) ‘empty oil
bottle’, having both -godo ‘cleared out’ and -a ‘hollow, having a hole’ with     Muha plus + becomes ruhu.
     15.se and -ro also function as nominalizers; see §11.4. Also, -rito may be perceived to be
-ri-to (participle-nominalizer).
Noun Phrase                                                                         57wii-godo (house-cleared“out) ‘cleared area for a house’ and kiibu-a
(canoe-hollow) ‘canoe’. When two classifiers occur on a noun, the second
is the one used for concordance with the modifier as in (152).(152) wye-godo-a                 ti-a-re             abo-a-ha       yet

"  Another specific method of coordinating nominalized constructions is
used when describing the various characteristics within a group. In such
cases, yd ‘to be’ occurs uninflected at the end of each nominalized
construction; and the main verb of the sentence is bahi ‘to be’, which refers
to the manner in which entities exist—see (421).(421) gahe-ra        vaka   warikéda-be-da    ya   soka   hai-ra   ya

       i ‘that’       +     -hdi ‘flat, thin’    =     ihdi ‘that flat, thin thing there’   Inanimate demonstrative pronouns may be marked for plural by -vi, e.g.,
adi-hai-ri (this-flat“thin-p) ‘these flat thin things’. Some deverbal nouns
(marked by -a/-ka, -/-k#, -ro/-se, and -h#) do not require -ri in the plural.
Instead, adi ‘this’, and        ti ‘that’, may       occur   alone   to refer to ‘these’     and
‘those’.                          .
   Demonstrative pronouns occur with suffixes which generally refer to an
implicit (or previously mentioned) head. When they occur with the head
noun, they follow it since the head noun is generally topicalized in this
position. Illustration (99) shows ti-a ‘that hollow thing’ following the head

verb morphology is quite extensive with verbal suffixes expressing
emphasis, direction of movement, causation, benefaction, negation,
contraexpectation,       as   well   as   aspect,   tense-mood,   and   person-number.
Verbs may also have derivational suffixes which form nouns or adverbs
(including descriptive modifiers which are classified as nouns). In (19), note
the string of verbal suffixes -bdsi (distal), -ka (far past) and -bi (third
person masculine singular).(19)   “ye raka wa-ya”            yi-basi-ka-bi

or as affixes to the verb root. For example, in (20), the adverb buto ‘very
much’ precedes the object as a separate word. In (21), buto ‘very much’
has become -busa ‘a lot’, an affix to the verb root. (See §3.6 for further
detail on intensifiers.)(20)    buto               ye-re tudi-a-ba               ida

"  Some of the embedded clauses appear to be prenominal relative clauses
because the regular, free noun form is used as the classifier for the
152                                                                           Barasano Syntaxnominalization. In this sense some nouns serve as their own classifier, that
is, the same form is used, rather than a shorter suffix. Such nouns follow
adjectives and nominalized clauses just as a classifier suffix would. In (488)
and (489) giibu ‘log’, which can occur alone, here functions as a classifier
referring to a log on which bundles of bdhi leaves for roofing are set.
  In (490), giibu ‘log’ is serving as the classifier for the nominalization ‘that
which is (to rest) on the end of poles which are caused to be crosswise’
rather than as a head noun for a relative clause.” The same is true in
(491), in which giibu ‘log’ functions twice as a classifier, once on the
nominalization ‘that which is caused to run lengthwise in the house’ and
once on the nominalization ‘that which is called yuria giibu’:(488) gahe giibu    yoa-ri                 giibu

in that the     nominalization       occurs     first, followed      by the   noun.   Here   the
  67 _puriri is the plural form for -huria ‘part (of a cylinder)’.
   68 yuriagitbu is considered to be the name of the log and the speakers deny that it
signifies anything other than a name. However, the fact that much of the language used in
river travel is used for moving in a house, that yu is ‘to take downriver’ and that té-o-n-a
gibu-ri ‘logs which are caused to run crosswise across the house’, leads to the definition
given.

nominalization eha-ra-re ‘at the ones who arrive’ is in apposition with the

phrases with marked participles, it does not change when there is a switch

participants and in (589) there is a switch in participants.","[202, 203]"
"    1We use the Spanish names Barasano and Taiwano when referring to el idioma barasano

out of their homeland) since March of 1977 under the auspices of the
Summer Institute of Linguistics and the Ministry of Government of
Colombia. We benefitted from prior work by Richard and Connie Smith
(see references for Smith). We have worked extensively with individuals of
the following four dialects (as the individual identifies his or her dialect).
Among the Barasana: Hilda Marin Leén and Roberto Marin N. of the
Yeba Masa; Jaime Reina G. of the Janeraé (Céme Masa) (1); Antonio and
Enrique Lagorio (Queti Masa) and Emilio (Uma Nara) of the Janera.
Among the Taiwana, Alejandro Motero of the Eduria has been very
helpful.
   The major difference between Janera (Barasano) and Eduria (Taiwano)
is the position of pitch-stress on words. Come Masa, Queti Masa and Uma
Nara refer to themselves as Janera when relating to outsiders. Since Céme
Masa has some common dialectical differences in the choice of words from
the other two dialects, we use the Céme Masa (ancestral name) and Uma
Nara (joking name) to distinguish them. We have concentrated our efforts
on studying these three dialects of Barasano and this grammar sketch is of
those dialects. However,        where we are aware of them, we will note some
of the differences           between   the   other   dialects,   using     the   following
abbreviations:(1)       « #8 Janera

Barasano is ov, with the subject generally following the verb.
  When a pronoun occurs which refers to the subject, it immediately
follows the predicate verb. Compare (2), a simple ov construction, with (3)
where the object and verb are followed by the pronoun ida ‘they’, followed
by two noun phrases which clarify to whom ‘they’ refers. This statement
was a response to the question, “Why have you come?’(2)      yu-re    ha-bi

"  When     the speaker hears what he is referring to, but does not see it, -ro
‘heard’ is used in place of any other present indicator. With verbs of
motion (change of location), -ro (heard) becomes -do (toward here, heard)
or -to (nonproximate heard) and is preceded by -a (motion) (except in the
case of the irregular verbs wa ‘to move’ and wadi ‘to come’). In (248) and
