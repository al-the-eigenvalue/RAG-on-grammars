The external subject usually precedes the ""core of the sentence. The external                 pigs      0.3-0.N-PAST feed:3.SG.F

it is followed by a pause; see 7.7. A topic does not require a syntactic relation to
core of the sentence.                                                                   However, the other orders do occur. In fact, the object can occur outside the core of

demonstrative suffixes distinguish four degrees of proximity. The possessive       all have a final high tone is probably due to paradigmatic levelling. Or maybe these
distinguish person and number, but not gender, of the possessor. Indefinite s      high tone suffixes originate from constructions with the noun in the construct case and

there are equivalent elements in the compound verbs. The semantic relation is                      dah 'to enter'                              hardah 'to arrive'

The element har- occurs in a small number of compound verbs. It is different                      kiic 'to return'                             inkiic 'to repeat'
hara because some verbs have both forms with a difference in meaning, for ex
harhlaqaat 'to fail' versus hara hlaqaat 'almost tired'. The fact that har can                    tla>aas 'to let sth. open to harm'           intlaa' 'to set out to dry'

Comparatives are expressed by the adverb ak 'more'. The standard against which         The adverb kilos 'only, alone' consists of the noun kila' 'exact, very' (see 5.1 ) and the
comparison is made is introduced by the preposition ta 'than'.                         third person singular possessive suffix os. Like a verbal adverb it can occur inside the

"2 . 1 . 1 . The consonants.
The consonant phonemes are displayed in the following chart. A description of the
phonetic realisation of the consonants follows. ""Glottalised""' is used as a cover term
to include all consonants produced with a glottal stop or with laryngealization, i.e.
the ejective affricates t s , tl and q, the pharyngeal fricative c which is produced with
creaky voice and the glottal stop. The fricatives are all voiceless, except for c. The
approximants are central approximants. The labial consonants are in column (1 ) .
The alveo lar consonants are i n (2). The lateral consonants are in a column, (3), for
ease of presentation. The palatal consonants, column ( 4), in brackets are rare and
occur mainly in borrowed words. The velar and uvular consonants, column (5) , have
labialised counterparts, column (6). Pharyngeal consonants are in column (7) and
glottals in column (8).

for [<i] . The labialised consonants are writ ten with a digraph having w as a second
element. I use the following digraphs instead of some phonetic symbols:
        hh for [h]
        h l for [+]
        ts for [ts,]
        tl for [t+)]

        ny for [.J1 ]
        eh for (e]
        sh for [!]The use of digraphs could give rise to interpretation problems with consonant se­
quences. Two adjacent consonants must be if!terpreted as a digraph whenever possi­
ble. To a.v oid ambiguity, I insert a dot between two consonants when necessary, e.g. to
distinguish sh.h from s.hh.

                                                                                                 the demonstrative, possessive, and a construct case suffix, have a high tone, but the
       tlay 'he leaves'                                                                          specific indefinite suffix has a low tone. Personal pronouns and the numbers one to
       tlaw 'I leave'                                                                            nine have a high tone on the final syllable. On the verb, tone indicates tense and mood;
                                                                                                 see 4.2.4. In adjectives, tone indicates gender; see 5.1 .
The diphthong ay becomes ee in stressed closed syllables.                                        In general, the high tone only occurs on the last syllable, but nouns with a high tone

suffix follows. The last two syllables of a word can also be high due to the presence
two adjacent high tone suffixes.                                                                      kwaga cayiin or

The penultimate syllable of a noun is high in the vocative.
                                                                                              In addition to tone and vowel length, there is non-contrastive predictable word stress.

                                                                                              such as:
Another circumstance in which the penultimate syllable is pronounced high is in exag

       'at that period'                                                                       is on the penultimate syllable if this syllable contains a long vowel. If the penultimate

2.3. Syllable sequence restrictions and related rules.
Monosyllabic words cannot consist of a CV only. The vowel must be long.                  This restriction holds only for polysyllabic roots, since such initial syllables do occur

       laa (f) 'today'                                                                   vowel in the second syllable is epenthetic, the stress is on the first syllable. If the
       d i i (f) 'place'                                                                 second syllable contains a long vowel or a high tone, this syllable is stressed. In verbs,
                                                                                         vowel length of the final (mostly second) syllable is dictated by inflection.
There is vowel length opposition word-finally. For example:

are longer than a short vowel. Polysyllabic words of which the word-final t, k, or s           mahhat 'shadow'

3 . 1. Gender of nouns
Iraqw nouns have gender distinction. According to the agreement on the verb, nouns
can be divided into three groups . . The group that shows the same agreement as the
third person masculine singular subject is called masculine, (m) , ( 1 ) ; the group that
shows the same agreement as a third person feminine singular subject is called feminine,
     (2); the group that shows the same agreement as a third person plural subject is
called neuter, (n) , (3). Note that gender agreement is irrespective of number. The
masculine noun of ( 1 ) is plural in number but has a third person singular masculine
ending on the verb. The feminine noun in (2) is plural in number and has a third
person singular feminine ending on the verb. The noun in (3) is singular in number,
but is neuter in gender, because of the third person plural ending on the verb.(1 )   daaqay   i giilin .                  giilin

The feminine words have a subgroup, which is indicated with (fl ) ; the masculine words
have a subgroup, which is indicated with (m1 ) . These subgroups are defined by a
different form of the gender linker preceding noun suffixes; see 3.4.
3.1 . 1 . Predictability by form
The gender of a noun is overt to a large extent if the noun contains a number suffix.
Homophonous plural suffixes can have different genders, such as the plural suffixes -o
(f) and -o ( n). Nouns with one of the following suffixes are masculine: -ay, -angw,
-mo. Nouns with one of the following suffixes are feminine: -aawe, -i, -ani, -a, -o,

- > , -ano. Neuter nouns are those with one of the following suffixes: -'i, -eeri, -du,

 Again, the order of the derivational suffixes is very rigid. The last consonant is al
 treated as a suffix if it is a possible suffix, i.e. if it is s, t, w, or m. For example,                        pa'aat 'to be split'                      pacaas 'to split'
 verb axaas 'to listen' has a durative form axmiis. The final s is treated as                                     daahh 'to boil'                           dahhaas 'to boil sth.'
 it were a causative suffix, although there is no verb stem ax related to axaas .                                 duux 'to take out, to marry'              duxuum 'to be taking out, to get
 durative suffix m is strictly speaking, an infix in such cases. These cases are n                                                                          married'
and regular. It is an infix of a very restricted nature because it can only be                                    kongoo > 'to fall'                        kohgo>oot 'to be fallen'
by what looks like a suffix. At any rate, l will indicate it as an infix ·because t                               hunguuc 'to recover  .
                                                                                                                                        ,                   hungucuus 'to rest'
fact that the form without the infix is a base form is important in certain cases:
lak < m >iit 'to be waiting' the combination of durative and middle voice suffix is                       The spreading of the rounding of the consonant :o t ?e following epenthetic vowel is a
possible because the latter is in fact part of the base form. In a verb such as gac                       morphophonological rule restricted to verbal denvatwn.

the final root consonant because aw looks like an inchoative suffix and, in                                         daaxw 'to make an incision'
                                                                                ""' ""'""n•·rt ""'""'""'"":ji;
with verbs with such a suffix, no durative suffix m can be used with this verb.                                     deeqw 'to shave'                        deequum 'to be shaving'                                                                                                          A long vowel is shortened in verb stems if a syllable follows with a velar, pharyngeal,
the reduplicated form not only has the meaning of habitual but also covers durati
aspect. What follows the infix is seen as a suffix in form, but at the same time it
seen as part of the base form with respect to meaning.                                                    or glottal consonant in the onset, or if a glide follows. However, ee and o o are not

4.2.5. The verb naa'aruut 'to be bare' (said of soil) may be derived from the                                    'to sp rea d', diya'aat , diya'amiit.
naa'ari 'damp soil'. For some verbs, the suffix -uut is preceded by the adjectival s
-ar; see 5. 1 .                                                                                                  The infix <ar> does not combine with a durative suffix -m nor with the middle voice

Some verbs end in the suffix -uut, where there is no form without the suffix.                                    A number of verbs have a single and a double reduplicated form, namely those which

In 4 .3 . 1 . ( 37 ) I have given the formula for the order of the derivational suffixes.                        not as a durative suffix but as an instance of reduplication although the regular order is
I will discuss the possible combination s of the morphemes. In addition to a causati                             reduplication first. My reason for doing so is that these verbs lack another reduplicated
suffix, verbs can have a durative, middle yoice, or habitual derivation.                                         form and the form with the reduplicated durative has a habitual or iterative meaning.

 D it proefschrift is een synchrone beschrijving van het Iraqw. De gegevens staan in dit
 werk cent raal en niet de theorie. Het Iraqw is een Zuid-Koesjitische taal die gesproken
 wordt door ongeveer een half rniljoen mensen in Tanzania. Over deze taal is betrekkelijk
 weinig gepubliceerd. De gegevens die aan dit werk ten grondslag liggen zijn verzameld
door middel van eigen veldwerk. Hoofdstuk een geeft informatie over de geografische
en socio-lingu""istische situatie van de taal en bespreekt de onderzoeksgeschiedenis en de
 classificatie. Ook vindt U er bibliografische informatie over het Iraqw.
De inventaris van klanken, de lettergreepstruktuur en de klankregels worden behandeld
in hoofdstuk twee. Het Iraqw kent onder andere verschillende keelklanken, laterale
klanken en ejektieven. (Hoge) toon heeft beperkte positionele mogelijkheden binnen
het woord en heeft meer een grammatikale dan een lexikale funktie.
De vormleer wordt behandeld in de hoofdstukken drie voor de naamwoorden, vier voor
de werkwoorden en vijf voor de andere woordklassen. Het naamwoord kent drie ges­
lachten en een rijk systeem van meervoudsvorming. In de derde persoon richt het
werkwoord zich naar het geslacht en niet naar het getal van het onderwerp. Centraal
in de grammatika van het Iraqw staat een element dat eerder ""selector"" of "" indikator""
genoemd is. In hoofdstuk 4. 1 . laat ik zien dat dit in feite verschillende werkwoorden
""zijn"" en daarmee versmolten voornaamwoorden zijn. De achtervoegsels voor werkwo­
ordsafleiding hebben een strikte volgorde; ook versteende en schijnbare achtervoegsels
moeten hieraan voldoen, waardoor tussenvoegsels ontstaan.
In hoofdstuk zes beschrijf ik de struktuur van de naamwoordgroep. De hoofdstukken
zeven, acht en negen omvatten de rest van de syntaxis. In hoofdstuk ?even behandel
ik de enkelvoudige zin, in hoofdstuk acht bijzinnen en in hoofdstuk negen vraagzinnen.
Vraagzinnen bevatten vaak een bijzin. Hoofdstuk tien behandelt de samengestelde zin.
Als voorbeeldmateriaal zijn nog enkele teksten toegevoegd in hoofdstuk elf, te weten
twee verhalen, een beschrijving van een gewone dag in de Iraqw samenleving, en een
versie van de geschiedenis van het Iraqw volk.","[176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188]"

"The gender of nouns that do not contain a number suffix is not predictable. Compare
ti>itaa 'story ' , which is feminine with ti>ita 'kind of tree ' , which is masculine.
Som� tendencies in gender allocation on the basis of phonological shape of the noun
without a number suffix can be discerned. Most nouns end in a vowel. Nouns ending
in u tend to be masculine. Nouns ending in other vowels tend to be feminine. Loan
words from Swahili follow this pattern.
