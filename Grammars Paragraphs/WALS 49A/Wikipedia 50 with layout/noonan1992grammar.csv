8.5.2 TopicalizationTopicalization involves the displacement of an NP from its usual position
to the beginning of the sentence.103 A topicalized NP is always inter-
preted as definite or generic. Further, it is interpreted as the topic or
orientation of the sentence, a role otherwise played by the subject. 4
    Only one NP per sentence can be topicalized. This NP can be a DO or
IO, an object of a preposition, an associative NP, or even an NP in a sub-
ordinate clause:
            (1)   abwor rwot tamo ni eneko
                  lion king 3s-think-hab comp 3s-kill-perf
                  'the lion, the king thinks that he killed it'
When the topicalized NP is an object of a preposition, a benefactive, or an
associative NP, a pronominal copy must be left in the original position:
            (2)   an rwot omiyo dyag bota
                  I king 3s-give-perf cow to-Is
                    was given the cow by the king'
            (3)   okelo aneno palamerS
                  O. ls-see-perf knife-3sa
                  Okelo, I saw his knife'
                                    Deviations from basic order            151If the topicalized NP is a first or second person pronoun, a pronominal
copy must be left in the original position regardless of what syntactic posi-
tion the topicalized NP originates:
            (4)     an kec änekka tütwäl
                    I hunger 3s-kill-prog-ls very+much
                    Tm really hungry' (lit: 'hunger is killing me very much')
            (5)     yin däkö omiyi dyel
                    you woman 3s-give-perf-2s goat
                    'you were given a goat by the woman'
When the topicalized NP is a human third person DO or IO, it need not
leave a pronominal copy:
            (6)     locä kec anekko tutwal
                    man hunger 3s-kill-prog very+much
                    'the man is very hungry*
            (7)     locä kec änekke tutwal
                    man hunger 3s-kill-prog-3s very+much
                    'the man is very hungry'
However, non-human third person DO's never leave a pronominal copy:
            (8)     apwo atxn oncno
                    V
            /C\ \       A   \ j A    ^   V   *
                    hare child 3s-see-perf
                    'the hare was seen by the child'
    There is a special construction available for topicalizing noun subjects.
This is invariably found in discourse contexts where an old topic is
reintroduced (Sec. 10.1). In this construction, the pronoun en 'he, she, it' or
gin 'they' is placed in sentence initial position followed by the noun subject:
            (1)     gin rwodi tetek
                    they kings 3p-strong-hab
                    'kings are very powerful'
            (2)        okelo ödök
                    he O. 3s-go-fback-perf
                    Okelo went back'
This is referred to as the reinforced subject construction in Sec. 10.1.
     In terms of the typology suggested by Li and Thompson (1976), Lango
is a subject prominent language. One effect of this is that Lango does not
have sentences like the following:
                Mandarin
            (1) nei-chang huo xingkui xiaofang-dui lai de kuai
                that-classifier fire fortunate fire-brigade come adv-part quick
                'that fire (topic), fortunately the fire brigade came quickly'
                (Li and Thompson 1976, p. 462)
152                         The syntax of simple sentences                Japanese
            (2) sakana wa tai ga oisii
                  fish part red-snapper part delicious-is
                  'fish (topic), red snapper is the most delicious'
                  (Kuno 1973, p. 62)
where NP's that are neither arguments of the verb nor associatives are
topicalized. Note, however, that topics from subordinate or parallel
clauses are possible (Sec. 9.9.1, 11.2). Topics that are not subjects play a
much larger role in Lango syntax than in English, having certain proper-
ties normally attributed to subjects (Noonan and Bavin 1978, Sections
9.10and 11.1).
     Notice that question words (Sec. 8.9) can never be topicalized be-
cause they are not, by definition, definite and cannot be the sentence
orientation.
     Right dislocation seems to occur only as an afterthought phenomenon
in Lango, and not as a part of a regular strategy for rightmost placement
of topics (unlike other Nilotic languages, such as Nandi). 106
8.5.3 Variation in the placement of adverbialeIn Sec. 8.1, it was noted that adverbials may be placed either at the begin-
ning or end of the sentence:
            (1)    awo'ro akelo odwogo
                   yesterday O. 3s-come+back-perf
                   'Yesterday, Okelo came back'
            (2)    okelo odwogo awo'ro
                   O. 3s-come-i-back-perf yesterday
                   Okelo came back yesterday'
(1) is appropriate when the adverbial is background and the rest of the
sentence, or at least odwogo, is being asserted. (2) is appropriate when
the adverbial is being asserted. (1) is a felicitous response to (3), and (2)
to (4):
            (3)    awo'ro okelo otimo go?
                   yesterday O. 3s-do-perf what
                   'yesterday, what did Okelo do?'
            (4)    okelo odwogo awene?
                   O. 3s-come+back-perf when
                   'when did Okelo come back?'
The placement of adverbials, then, serves the same pragmatic function as
the placement of DO's.
                           Expression of passive senses                   153
8.6 Expression of passive sensesLango has no morphological passive. However, the pragmatic function of
a passive, which is essentially to create a new sentence orientation out of
a patient in a transitive relationship,    is taken over in part by secondary
orientation verbs (Sec. 8.2.1) and the middle voice (Sec. 8.2.2), and in part
by topicalization (Sec. 8.5.2).108
    While SA verbs and the middle voice fulfill the function of permitting
patients in transitive relationships to be subjects, they do not allow for the
expression of the transitive agent and lack the true semantic aspects of
the passive. That is, they lack the sense of the transitive patient acted upon
by the transitive agent. Topicalized sentences come closer to passives in
this regard. Notice that sentences with SA verbs or verbs in the middle
voice are never translated as passives, but topicalized sentences frequent-
ly are. Our bilingual Lango-English informants would usually translate
sentences like the following with the English passive:
            (1)   an rwot onen
                  I king 3s-see-perf-ls
                  Ί was seen by the king'
Notice, however, that not all topicalized sentences can be translated with
the English passive, e.g. sentences where the topicalized element is not
the DO. Further, topicalization remains fundamentally different from pas-
sive — the topicalized NP does not become subject (see Sec. 11.1).
    It should also be noted that Lango has no impersonal construction.
To a certain extent, the sense of an impersonal can be rendered by an in-
definite subject,
            (1)   gattoro ojwato όρίό
                  person-indef 3s-hit-perf O.
                  'someone hit Opio'
or a subjectless verb conjugated in the third person singular:
            (2)   ojwato όρίο
                  3s-hit-perf O.
                  'he/someone hit Opio'
8.7 The organization of the noun phraseNouns are not marked for case and are not lexically specified for concord
class. They may, however, be inflected for singular and plural number
(Sec. 8.7.7). Pronouns and agreement inflections on verbs reflect only the
categories of number and person.
154                        The syntax of simple sentences8.7.1 Order of elements within the noun phraseThe head noun is always first in the Lango noun phrase. It is followed by,
in order, associative NP's, quantifiers, adjectives, and relative clauses.
Determiners normally occur last in the NP, but may precede relative
clauses. The order of elements is summed up as follows:
            head-N ass-NP quant adj det rel-cl det
                                     t          f
                                          or
An example employing all the above elements follows:
            (1)   gwoggi a loca adekk a doip äme dakö
                  dogs att-part man att-f part-three att-f part big rel + part
                      woman 3s-see-perf-this
                  'these three big dogs of the man that the woman saw'
    All classes of noun modifiers can occur with the 'attributive particle'
ä, which is morphologically fused onto numerals and the relative particle
äme. If the final sound of the word preceding ä is a consonant, the con-
sonant is geminated (if the final consonant is r, the preceding vowel is
lengthened instead). Final vowels are unaffected — see Sec. 1.2.3, 2.2.
            (1)   gwökk a loca    (gwök 'dog')
                  dog att+part man
                  'the man's dog'
            (2)   dyäijrj ä dwog   (dyärj 'cow')
                  cow att+part big
                  'the big cow'
            (3)   äbwoor ä räc        (äbwor 'lion')
                  lion att-f-part bad
                  'the bad lion'
            (4)   päkö ä dit        (jiäkö 'girl')
                  girl att+part big
                  'the big girl'
     With the exception of the determiners and some peculiarities relating
to the associative constructions, the order in the NP is invariable. The syn-
tax of the associative construction will be dealt with below in Sections 8.7.2
and 8.7.3. Relative clauses will be treated in Section 2.2.
    Attributive adjectives always occur with the attributive particle (ex-
cept when the latter is deleted phonologically as when followed by a
word beginning with a vowel (Sec. 2.7) the adjective agrees with the noun
it modifies in number, even if the noun itself displays no singular/plural
distinction:
                        The organization of the noun phrase             155           (1)   a. gwokkaber
                    dog att+part good-sg
                    'the good dog'
                 b. gwoggi ä beco
                    dogs att+part good-pi
                    'the good dogs'
           (2)   a. guluaber
                    pot att+part good-sg
                    'the good pot'
                 b. gulu a beco
                    pot att+part good-pi
                    'the good pots'
Quantifiers also occur with the attributive particle. The numerals ten and
below have fused with the attributive particle so that the particle is part
of the numeral even when not used attributively:
           (1)   aryStiebota
                 two 3s-be+present-hab to-ls
                   have two'
In this syntactic environment, when the head is not overt, other quan-
tifiers do not take the attributive particle:
           (2)   pol tie bot»
                 many 3s-be+present-hab to-ls
                  have many'
                 (cf gwoggi ä pol
                     dogs att+part many
                     'many dogs')
The quantifier ducu 'all, both' exceptionally never takes the attributive
particle:
           (3)   dok ducu
                 cattle all
                 'all the cattle'
    The determiners (which include the demonstratives) normally occur
as suffixes on the last word of the NP:
           (1)   gwokkx
                 dog-this
                 'this dog'
           (2)   gwokk a dwoggi
                 dog att+part big-sg-this
                 'this big dog'
156                        The syntax of simple sentences            (3)   gwoggi ä doip aryoni
                  dogs att+part big-pi att+part-two-this
                  'these two big dogs'
(The demonstrative -ni 'this' and -no 'that' lose their -n-, geminating final
consonants according to the usual consonant cluster simplification rules
of the language. When the NP includes a relative clause, the determiner
may be attached to the last word before the relative, be suffixed to the last
word in the relative, or occur in both positions at once:
            (4)   gwoggi ä dona aryoni äme loca onekoni
                                       t                   f
                  dogs att+part big two-this rel+part man 3s-kill-perf-this
                  'these two big dogs that the man killed'
The longer the relative clause, the more likely the determiner is to be
positioned before it.
    Nouns may be also modified by prepositional phrases, whose posi-
tion within the NP is like that of the relative clause, i.e. last but for the
determiners:
            (1)   jo ipäco
                  people in village
                  'people in the village'
            (2)   Dt ä dwoi) me bütü
                  house att+part big for sleep-infin
                  'a big house for sleeping'
8.7.2 Associative constructionsAn associative construction consists of a noun head followed by an associa-
tive NP. The range of semantic relations that can be coded by associative
constructions include possession, but includes also a wide range of other
relationships. What is communicated by the construction per se is just an
association between two nouns; the exact relation is left to inference:
            (1)   gwokkäloca
                  dog att+part man
                  'the man's dog'
            (2)   beer a kwän
                  good att+part read-infin
                  'the good of reading'
            (3)   kwann ä okelo
                  read-infin att+part O.
                  Okelo's reading'
                         The organization of the noun phrase                  157            (4)   okwänn a buk
                  readers att+part book
                  'the readers of the book'
     There are two sorts of associative constructions: The first codes inalienable
possession, the second codes all other associative relationships. The in-
alienable construction codes 'part-of relations, i.e. situations where the head
of the construction is interpreted as part of the noun coded as the associative,
as in the case of body parts. The inalienable associative does not take the at-
tributive particle a — but other associatives do. Contrast the following:
                  inalienable              alienable
            (1)   wi rwot                  wicc ä rwöt
                  head king                head att+part king
                  'the king's head'        'the king's (animal) head'
            (2)   pyen äjägä                pyenn a dako
                  skin cat                  skin att+part woman
                  'the cat's skin'          'the hide belonging to the woman'
            (3)   bad daktäl               batt ä daktal
                  arm doctor               hand att+part doctor
                  'the doctor's arm'       'the doctor's foreleg of meat'
            (4)   leb loca                 ^PP * loca
                  tongue man               tongue att+part man
                  'the man's tongue'       'the man's tongue-meat'
Pictures, personal character, and anything else relating to the individual's
selfhood are inalienable:
            (1)   cälloca
                  picture man
                  'the man's picture'
            (2)   kit IOC9
                  character man
                  'the man's character'
Locative relationships are treated as inalienable,
            (3)   i läget mac
                  in side fire
                  'beside the fire'
            (4)   i pirn bakci
                  in head chair
                  On the chair'
            (5)   i wi kom
                  in head chair
                  On the chair'
158                         The syntax of simple sentencesas are descriptive associatives and compounds in general (Sec. 7):
            (6)   5t cem
                  house food
                  'restaurant'
Associative constructions with won 'father of, owner' as head are inalienable,
            (7)   won poto
                  owner field
                  'the owner of the field'
as are blood relationships: sister-of, uncle-of, etc. (but see Sec. 5.2.4).
Familial relationships acquired through marriage are not considered in-
alienable in Lango:
            (8)   dako ä okelo
                  woman att+part O.
                  Okello's wife'
However, some examples of inalienable possession with marriage rela-
tions have been recorded. Expressions of origin (in geography, manufac-
ture, etc.) are inalienable:
            (9)   mon lira
                  women Lira
                  'the women of Lira'
The inalienable associative is also used in a partitive sense:
            (10) guludek
                 pot stew
                 'a pot of stew'
            (11) m55 jiim
                 oil sesame
                 'sesame oil'
    Pronominal associatives have a number of peculiarities. First, though
they too distinguish alienable from inalienable, both kinds are suffixes
and do not use the associative particle. Instead, the difference is indicated
by gemination (alienable) and its lack (inalienable) — see Sec. 5.2.4 for a
more complete discussion of associative affixes:
                  inalienable               alienable
            (1)   pyena                     pyenna

                  'my skin'                 'my (animal) hide'
            (2)   wiya                      wicca
                  head-lsa                  head-lsa
                  'my head'                 'my (animal) head'

                  leg-lsa                    leg-lsa
                  'my leg'                   'my leg (of meat)'
When the head noun ends in a vowel, alienable and inalienable possession
cannot be distinguished, as we see with remo 'blood':
            (4)   remomere                   remomeri
                  blood-3sa                  blood-3sa
                  'his blood'                'his (animal) blood'
            (5)   remona                     remona
                  blood-Isa                  blood-Isa
                  'my blood'                 'my (animal) blood'
When contraction takes place (Sec. 5.1.2.2, 5.2.4), the forms can be dis-
tinguished:
            (6)   reme                       remmere
                  blood-3sa                  blood-3sa
                  'his blood'                'his (animal) blood'
    The second peculiarity of pronominal associatives is that, though the
position of associative nouns is fixed (they immediately follow the head
noun), the position of pronominal associatives is variable. They occur
either suffixed to the head noun or the last element of the NP. Compare
the following sets:
            (1)   a. bukkaadwOQ
                     book-lsa att+part big
                     'my big book'
                  b. bukk a dwoq'Qä
                     book att+part big-lsa
                     'my big book'
            (2)   a. bukke me akwänä
                     book-lsa for read-gerund
                     'my reading book'
                  b. buk me akwana'na
                     book for read-gerund-Isa
                     'my reading book'
8.7.3 Complex associativesIn referring to an individual, when it is the physical body not the per-
sonality that is at stake, it is usual (in some cases obligatory) to use a con-
struction with kom 'body' as the head noun, with reference to the
individual expressed as an associative NP:
160                        The syntax of simple sentences            (1)   kom loca gwe
                  body man 3s-be+smelly-hab
                  'the man stinks'
            (2)   äjägä obedö i körn loca
                  cat 3s-sit-perf on bocy man
                  'the cat sat on the man'
With predicates like ijweyo 'to be smelly', kom is obligatory, kom is almost
always found after the ubiquitous preposition i, even when reference to
the physical body is not intended:
            (3)   otito i koma
                  3s-tell-perf about body-lsa
                  'he told something about me'
r, unlike the other simple prepositions (Sec. 8.8), cannot take human pronom-
inal objects and requires kom as a place to attach these object pronoun affixes.
    When referring to emotional states, it is usual not to refer to the ex-
periencer directly, but rather to attribute the emotion to the stomach yic
or liver cwip. The experiencer is expressed as an associative NP:
            (4)   yia a war) ni gwok'ka okao rwot
                  stomach-lsa 3s-burn-prog comp dog-lsa 3s-bite-perf king
                  'I'm upset that my dog bit the king'
Other body part nouns are used in similar constructions.
    When ko, yic, cwip, etc. are found in such constructions, a special sort
of associative is frequently encountered. This involves placing the associa-
tive noun first, and leaving a pronominal copy in its place. Compare (1)
above with (5):
            (5)   locä körne gwe
                  man body-3sa 3s-be+smelly-hab
                  'the man stinks'
This 'complex associative', though most common with body part head
nouns in subject position, can be found elsewhere:
            (6)   loca gwok'kcre"" obelo itinö
                  man dog-3sa 3s-frighten+away-perf children
                  'the man's dog frightened away the children'
            (7)   gwök OQweo loca körne
                  dog 3s-smell-perf man body-3sa
                  'the dog smelt the man'
The effect of the complex associative is to increase the prominence of the
associative NP, analogous to topicalization. In fact, when complex associa-
tives appear in subject position, as in (5) and (6), they are indistinguish-
able from topicalized associatives.
                          The organization of the noun phrase                 1618.7.4 Use of determinersAs noted above in the discussion on topicalization, a noun is normally not
marked as definite or indefinite. Its definiteness is a matter of interpreta-
tion, but the first noun in a sentence (either the subject or topicalized NP)
is necessarily definite (but see below). The likelihood of a definite inter-
pretation decreases toward the end of the sentence.
    The grammar, however, provides a few ways to insure a definite in-
terpretation. Any noun marked with a demonstrative will be given a
definite interpretation. There are three demonstratives, listed below, each
with a different deictic interpretation:
                  Sg                     PI
                 -ni                    -gi      'this/these'
                 -no                    -go      'that/those'
                 -ca/ka                 -ica     'that/those over there, yonder'
The morphology of these forms is discussed in Sec. 5.2.6.; their syntax was
discussed in Sec. 8.7.1. Impressionistically, they are used rather more fre-
quently than their counterparts in English, perhaps because of their func-
tion as definitizers.
     In addition to the demonstratives, Lango also employs a thematic
affix. This affix, whose form is -mere, can be attached to a noun
reintroduced from previous discourse (Sec. 10.1) or otherwise known
to the discussants, but not in the forefront of consciousness of the
hearer. It could in some cases be translated by 'the aforementioned',
'the . . . we know'. Nouns marked in this way are topics and occupy in-
itial, topic position. Proper nouns may be marked with -mere. Any noun
marked with this suffix will, of course, receive a definite interpretation.
The use of -mere is not obligatory for such topics and tends to be used
in dialogs rather than extended narratives. Time expressions frequent-
ly use -mere:
           (1)   τ dikkomere gin ducu obi no rwatte
                 in morning-theme they all 3p-come-perf meet-mid-infin
                 'in the morning, they all came to meet each other'
    A noun can receive an indefinite, and frequently non-specific, inter-
pretation with the suffix -moro, pi. -moga:
           (1)   nattSro
                 person-indef
                 'someone, somebody'
           (2)   gwok'koro
                 dog-indef
                 'some dog, a dog'
162                        The syntax of simple sentences            (3)   gwoggi'marä \
                  gwoggi'mogS J
                  dogs-indef
                  'some dogs, dogs'
-moro may be used in place of -mogS with plural nouns. The only way a
subject can receive an indefinite interpretation is if it is marked with
-moro:
            (4)   twollord ökäö ätin
                  snake-indef 3s-bite-perf child
                  'a snake bit the child'
The indefinite marker is almost always found with subjects in existential
constructions:
            (5)   puno'morS tie i qe it
                  pig-indef 3s-be+present-hab in back house
                  'there's a pig behind the house'
    Not all indefinites are marked with -maro; in fact, the majority are not.
Except for its use with generic nouns, such as gat 'person', gin 'thing', which
when -maro is suffixed onto them form the Lango equivalent of English in-
definite pronouns (cf (1) above), -maro is almost always found in subject
position. The reason for this is that the Lango sentence is organized rough-
ly on an old-new continuum. Subjects are always interpreted as definite
unless specifically made indefinite with -more (hence the association with
subjects in existential constructions). In other sentence positions, NP's are
assigned definite or indefinite interpretations pragmatically, and do not
require an explicit indefinitizer like subjects.
    See Sec. 9.11 for the expression of negative indefinite senses.","[166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178]"
"
    There is another sort of compound in Lango, consisting of the agent
noun prefixes (Sec. 5.2.2) followed by a clause describing a physical con-
dition, almost always, it seems, a physical disability. For example, to say
'he is blind' one says:
            (/ 11 \) wage
                       v  »
                     eye-3sa 3p-die-perf
                     'he's blind' (lit = 'his eyes died')
To this expression can be affixed either of the agent noun prefixes, ä- sin-
gular and o- plural to form:
           (2)    äwäqeötoo
                 'a blind person'
                 owärjgiotoö
                 'blind people'
Notice that in the latter, the 3pa -gi replaces the 3sa -e.
   Unlike the first sort of compound described in this section, these com-
pounds do not seem to be fully productive.
PART THREE:
  SYNTAX
           8. The syntax of simple sentences8.1 Basic order of the sentenceLango is an indirect role marking language (Noonan 1977), which is to
say it uses grammatical roles such as subject (Su) and direct object (DO)
as part of its strategy for indicating semantic roles, such as agent and
patient. Nouns are not marked for case, nor are there particles (ä la
Japanese, Korean, Persian) to indicate Su or DO roles. Word order, which
is fairly rigid, is the primary device used to indicate grammatical roles in
simple sentences. To the extent that word order permits, the order topic
first, comment last is also fairly rigidly adhered to. The unmarked order
of elements is:
     (topic) (Su) verb (benefactive) (DO) (prepositional phrases) (adverbials)
The topic slot may be filled by a noun playing any grammatical role in the
sentence (including associative NP's and NP's from subordinate clauses —
Sections 8.5.2 and 9.9.1). In the unmarked case, the subject is also the
topic.
    The subject is an obligatory component of the Lango sentence: Lango
has no impersonal constructions. However, it is reference to a subject that
is obligatory, not an overt subject NP, and an overt subject NP need not
be present:
            (1)   a. an äcämo dek
                     I ls-eat-perf stew
                       ate stew'
                  b. äcämo dek
                     ls-eat-perf stew
                       ate stew'
            (2)   a. loca öcämo dek
                     man 3s-eat-perf stew
                     'the man ate stew'
                  b. öcämo dek
                     3s-eat-perf stew
                     'he ate stew'
Benefactives [and antibenefactives] (ben) immediately follow the verb,
which takes the benefactive stem (Sec. 8.2.3):
            (1)   a. anadbk
                     I ls-go+back-perf
                        went back'
120                               The syntax of simple sentences                   b.    n d kkxd ko
                        I ls-go+back-ben-perf woman
                        Ί went back for the sake of the woman'
           (2)     a. gwokotoa
                      dog 3s-die-perf
                      'the dog died'
                   b. gw k otooyi loca
                        dog 3s-die-ben-perf man
                        'the dog died on the man'
DO's follow the benefactive if one is present:
           (1)     a. dako ted rigo
                      woman 3s-cook-perf meat
                      'the woman cooked the meat'
                   b. dako oteddi loce rino
                        woman 3s-cook-ben-perf man meat
                        'the woman cooked the meat for the man'
The order ben-DO is invariable in post-verbal position.
   Verbs are both inflected for DO (but not necessarily when followed by
a DO NP) and marked for transitivity (Section 8.2.1):
           (1)     an aneno ocako
                   I ls-see-perf O.
                   Ί saw Ochako'
           /C\ \   ·*   **   *I   *
           (z)     an ane ηε
                   I ls-see-perf-3s
                   Ί saw him'
           (3)     loca onena
                   man 3s-see-perf-ls
                   'the man saw me'
           (4)     loca onena an
                   man 3s-see-perf-ls me
                   'the man saw me'
           (5)     an aneno
                   I ls-see-perf
                   Ί saw' (Ί was not blind')
Non-human DO's are not pronominalized; the transitive verb alone suffices:
           (1)     aneno buk
                   ls-see-perf book
                   Ί saw the book'
                           Basic order of the sentence                  121
           (2)   aneno
                 ls-see-perf
                   saw it'
    Datives, referred to here as indirect objects (IO), may occur either as
the object of the preposition bot 'to', in which case they follow the DO,
           (1)   loca omxyo buk bot dakö
                 man 3s-give-perf book to woman
                 'the man gave the book to the woman'
or without bot, in which case the IO must precede the DO:
           (2)   loca omiyö dakö buk
                 man 3s-give-perf woman book
                 'the man gave the woman the book'
If both ben and IO occur in the same sentence, the IO must be expressed
with bot:
           (3)   loca omiiyx ätin buk bot dakö
                 man 3s-give-ben-perf child book to woman
                 'the man gave the book to the woman for the child'
When an IO immediately follows the verb, it and not the DO conditions
verb agreement:
           (4)   loca omiya buk
                 man 3s-give-perf-ls book
                 'the man gave me the book'
If both are pronominalized, the transitive verb suffices for a non-human
DO:
           (5)   loca ömiyä
                 man 3s-give-perf-ls
                 'the man gave it to me'
If the DO is human and pronominalized, the IO must be expressed as an
object of bot:
           (6)   loca ömiye bota
                 man 3s-give-perf-3s to-Is
                 'the man gave him (e.g. a slave) to me'
A pronominalized ben, IO, and DO can be accommodated by inflecting
the verb ( with a ben stem) for the ben argument, inflecting bot 'to' for
the IO; the transitive stem suffices for the DO if non-human:
           (7)   loca omriye bota
                 man 3s-give-ben-perf-3s to-Is
                 'the man gave it to me for him'
122                        The syntax of simple sentencesIf a ben is present, a human DO cannot be pronominalized unless it is
made the topic (Section 1.5.2):
            (8)   en loca okella
                  he man 3s-bring-ben-perf-ls
                  'he was brought by the man for me'
But even this strategy is not available if the DO is first or second person.
In such cases, an alternative sentence type is used, e.g.:
            (9)   loca okele pira
                  man 3s-bring-perf-3s because+of-ls
                  'the man brought him because of me'
Prepositional phrases, whether complements or adjuncts, must follow the
ben, DO, or IO (formed with or without bot):
            (1)   loca ömiiyi ätin buk bot däkö pi rwot
                  man 3s-give-ben-perf child book to woman because
                     of king
                  'the man gave the book to the woman for the child
                     because of the king'
Adverbial adjuncts are placed either at the beginning or end of the sentence:
            (2)   awo'ro loca ogweo gwök
                  yesterday the man 3s-kick-perf dog
                  'yesterday, the man kicked the dog'
            (3)   loca ögeö gwök awo'ro
                  man 3s-kick-perf dog yesterday
                  'the man kicked the dog yesterday'
The significance of the word order variations described above will be dis-
cussed in later sections, for instance Sec. 8.5.
    The negative particles pe and the more conservative mom (~ mam)
are normally placed between the subject and verb:
            (1)   loca öbinö päco
                  man 3s-come-perf home
                  'the man came home'
            (2)   loca pe obinö päco
                  man neg 3s-come-perf home
                  'the man didn't come home'
When the negative appears at the beginning of the sentence, the inter-
pretation may be one of 'external' negation, versus the 'internal' nega-
tion of the post subject position. This interpretation is possible only with
an intonational contour which does not drop normally, but stays high
throughout the subject NP, accompanied by a lengthening of pe:

meaning 'tobe not present, not exist' (Sec. 8.4). It should be emphasized
that preposed pe does not always have this interpretation.","[132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139]"

Subject propertiesLango is an indirect role marking language and the subject is the highest
ranking argument slot (Noonan 1977). This means that the subject must
be an argument of the verb — unlike the topic, which need have no spe-
cial relationship to the verb, but must have some recoverable relation to
the predication that follows so that the predication can be about the topic.
Further, the subject in Lango is an indispensable constituent; not only is
the matrix verb always inflected for subject, but subjects are almost always
referential — i.e. there are no 'dummy' subjects in Lango        and few im-
personal constructions. Recall that even weather expressions (Sec. 8.13)
are not impersonal in Lango. Only predicates with extraposed sentential
subjects are impersonal and of these only modal expressions are idiomatic
(Sec. 9.1.1).
     Where the topic provides the link with discourse and so controls
coreference across sentence boundaries, the subject controls coreference
within the sentence. This is because the subject is an integral part of the
predication, its semantic role determined by the valence scheme of the
verb, and so on, whereas the topic may originate outside the valence set,
i.e. from an associative construction or from a subordinate clause. So the
subject, not the topic, controls coreference with reflexives. Compare the
following sentences:
           (1) okelo okwao äläbä pire kene
                O. 3s-ask-perf A. about-3s self-3sa
                Okeloi asked Alaba about himself;'
           (2) äläbä okelö okwao pire kens
                A. O. 3s-ask-pcrf about-3s self-3sa
                'Alaba was asked by Okelo; about himself;'
In both (1) and (2), the reflexive pronoun can only refer to Okelo, the
subject. If Alaba is the intended object of pi, the reflexive cannot be used:
           (3) okelo okwao äläbä pire
                O. 3s-ask-perf A. about-3s
                Okelo asked Alaba; about himself;'
                    The status of subjects and objects in Lango syntax      261
The intended referent of pire in (3) could, of course, be someone other
than Alaba, but could not be Okelo.
    The subject is also interpreted as coreferential with the subjects of
verbs in all following verb phrases where there is no intervening S-bound-
ary. This includes the second clause in serial constructions (n.b. not
paratactic constructions — see Sec. 9.1.3 and 11.2) and infinitives, whether
complements or adjuncts:
                  serial
            ( 1 ) ogwarj okelo owoto ojwato
                  O. O. 3s-go-perf 3s-hit-perf
                  Ogwang was hit by Okelo'
                  complement
            (2) ogwai) okelo amitto jwatte
                  O. O. 3s-want-prog hit-infin-3s
                  Ogwang, Okelo wants to hit him'
                  adjunct
            (3)   ogwag okelo ojwato me yommo yx äläbä
                  O. O. 3s-hit-perf for soften-infin stomach A.
                  Ogwang was hit by Okelo in order to please Alaba'
Okelo, the subject, and not Ogwang, the topic, is interpreted as the sub-
ject of the second verb in the series in (1) and the infinitives in (2) and (3).
     Viewed from a traditional transformational perspective, Lango has
remarkably few subject creating processes. As noted in Sec. 8.6, there is
 no passive in Lango. As argued in 1.2.1, the Tr/SA distinction cannot be
viewed as an active/passive contrast, nor can the active/middle distinction
 (Sec. 8.2.2): Both lack the sense of the passive. Topicalization comes closest
to the sense, but does not result in the assumption of subject status by a
topicalized object.
     Similarly, raising phenomena are notably absent.            There are no
Lango equivalents to the English 'Floyd seems to like whiskey' and 'Ros-
coe is likely to be inebriated'. There is, in any case, a general disinclina-
tion to express judgements impersonally in Lango: The two sentences
mentioned above would normally be expressed in Lango with expressions
like know/believe/think that Floyd . . . ' or the like.
     In terms of the typology presented by Li and Thompson (1976), Lango
is a subject prominent language. Reference to subjects on the verb is
obligatory, and impersonal constructions are rare. But because it is poor
in grammatical operations that refer solely to subjects, it can only be con-
sidered weakly subject dominant. The topic plays a prominent role in
Lango syntax, and grammatical processes like relativization, interroga-
tion, and the like operate on objects as freely as subjects.
262                             Additional issues11.2 The grammatical status of parataxis and serializationThe paratactic construction represents something of a hybrid. On the one
hand, it has characteristic features of non-coordinate constructions:
Phonologically, it behaves as a simple sentence. Syntactically, there are
constraints on the second clause (no overt subject NP, the subject must be
interpreted as an argument of the first clause) which are reminiscent of
truncated embedded predications, frequently represented by infinitive
phrases or the like. And semantically, the paratactic construction can
sometimes be translated by simplex constructions in English or sentences
containing complement clauses. But on the other hand, there is the two
assertion aspect of parataxis and a range of interpretations that is similar
to clauses conjoined by 'and' in English.
     So the paratactic construction seems to partake of both coordinate and
non-coordinate status. Clearly, the second clause is not straightforwardly
grammatically subordinate to the first: There can be no subordinator like
the complementizer ni, the verb does not assume a special form like the
subjunctive or infinitive, nor can the switch/non-switch reference opposi-
tion be exploited as with hypotactic indicative complements. Subordinate
status would, in any case, be difficult to reconcile with the two assertion
semantics of parataxis. And just as clearly, parataxis differs from true coor-
dination in Lango. The Coordinate Structure Constraint controls cleft and
relativization in true coordinate structures, but does not apply to paratac-
tic constructions since NP's in the first clause may be clefted or relativized
on. Since the second clause in a paratactic construction seems neither to
be clearly subordinate nor clearly coordinate with the first, a new sort of
relationship can informally be proposed, namely that of 'parallel' struc-
tures. Parallel structures have the same grammatical rank, but are not coor-
dinate since there are syntactic constraints governing form and
interpretation of parallel structures, as opposed to the pragmatic con-
straints that govern the form and interpretation of true coordinate struc-
tures.150 They share with structures involving subordination syntactic
constraints on one clause (the second in parallel structure) but differ from
subordination in that the affected clause will not show any overt signs of
subordination. The fact that the second clause is of equal rank with the first
means that its verb will necessarily be fully inflected as a main verb and,
in the case of parataxis, that the interpretation of the second clause will be
unaffected by the first. Both of these characteristics serve to differentiate
parallel structures from main-subordinate relationships. 1^1  01     Parallel structures are fundamentally hybrids, partaking of aspects of
both subordination and coordination. Syntactically, there is some re-
semblance to main-subordinate relationships, but semantically they are
more like coordinate structures in that their meaning is horizontally rather
than vertically organized. That is, it is arranged in a linear sequence of bits
with relations between the bits left mostly to inference rather than organized
                    Grammatical status of parataxis and serialization      263around a main clause which acts as a sort of semantic pivot and filter.15""
                                                                  1 ^^
Main-subordinate relationships are characterized by the latter.
     Verbs in serial constructions are also parallel, but as pointed out in
Sec. 9.1.4, and elsewhere, serial and paratactic constructions have
numerous differences. Serials seem most compatible with an interpreta-
tion as parallel verb phrases.       This would naturally account for the
obligatory aspect and subject agreement, the possibility of only one nega-
tive per sentence, etc. Paratactic constructions are more compatible with
an interpretation as parallel clauses, which would account for the pos-
sibility of each clause having different aspect and different subjects, for
the possibility for separately negating each clause, etc. This analysis would
also be compatible with the interpretation of paratactic constructions as
constituting two assertions.
     Having examined the differences between parataxis and serialization
in Lango and, presumably, elsewhere, we can now speculate on a possible
diachronic relation between the two. I would like to suggest parataxis as
a possible source for serialization.     Serial constructions could develop
by reanalysis of paratactic constructions, especially where the syntactic con-
straints on serialization match, or nearly match, the pragmatic require-
ments of certain constructions.
     In the case of the comparative and ingressive, we find a match of this
sort. In these constructions, the subject of both clauses will necessarily be
the same, as will the aspect marking on both predicates. Independent nega-
tion, hardly possible given the sense of the ingressive, is not likely with
the comparative. And the semantic effect of one versus two assertions is
minimal in these cases. Reanalysis as serial constructions would just syn-
tacticize the pragmatic status quo. The only obvious syntactic consequence
would be the placement of the negative — from
            (1) adworj pe äl5 rwot
                ls-fat-hab neg ls-defeat-hab king
                'I'm fatter than the king*
when the construction is paratactic, to
            (2) pe adwOQ alo rwöt
                neg ls-fat-hab ls-defeat-hab king
                'I'm fatter than the king'
following reanalysis.
    In other cases, the syntactic requirements of serialization will be met,
if not as consistently, at least regularly. For instance,
            (3)   mac omio oboke otwo
                  fire 3s-give-perf leaf 3s-dry-perf
                  the fire gave it to the leaf (=did something to the leaf),
                      it dried
                  'the fire dried the leaf
264                               Additional issuesa causative paratactic construction, 6 meets the syntactic specifications
 for a serial as would quite likely the majority of instances of causative
parataxis. Reanalysis would leave the overall semantic complexity of these
sentences virtually unchanged, so that (3) as a serial could carry basically
the same information as before. Such constructions are potential can-
didates for reanalysis. Structurally, the jump from parallel clauses to paral-
lel verb phrases is not very great, particularly when the full potential of
the second clause, e.g. its ability to freely select a subject, is already limited
by the constraints on parataxis.
     Reanalysis from paratactic to serial will most likely occur where one
of the verbs assumes a regular role in a construction so that it can be given
a sentence functional interpretation. By this, I mean direct object marker,
indirect object marker, marker of comparative, marker of aspect, etc. In
Lango, ID- 'exceed' (and its synonym kat-) have assumed the role of marker
of comparative, and wot- 'go', when followed by another perfective verb,
serves to reinforce perfective aspect, though it retains a motional sense
as well. Its omission, however, in the ingressive construction would not
significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. Lango lacks the 'take'
construction (Lord 1973), found frequently in West African serializing lan-
guages and used there to mark direct objects and instruments and as a
causative marker, as well as other functions. Because of its widespread use
and its ability to take on sentence functional interpretations, this verb is
a fine candidate for reanalysis. Perhaps the frequent use of serialization
in some West African languages has gone hand-in-hand with the frequent
use of the 'take' construction. Lango lacks any verb in parataxis or
serialization with the generality of the 'take' construction. The various
words for 'take' in Lango play no special role in parataxis or serialization,
'give', another frequent participant in serial constructions across lan-
guages, does have a regular role in a paratactic construction in Lango.
But miy- 'give' does not mark indirect objects in Lango, unlike similar
verbs in West African serializing languages, and has a regular role only
in the causative construction, which has not been reanalyzed as serial (see
footnote 156). It may be that the lack of a 'take' construction or something
similar is an important factor in the predominance of parataxis over
serialization in Lango.
     We come now to the matter of the difficulty of embedding paratactic
constructions. As noted in the sections above, paratactic constructions can
be embedded as relative clauses and as complements to factive and ut-
terance predicates. They cannot be converted into infinitives or subjunc-
tives, unlike serials — the paratactic construction would in any case be
incompatible with the irrealis interpretation of the subjunctive. It is easy
to understand why paratactic constructions can be embedded as comple-
ments to utterance predicates, where they would simply serve as reports
of assertions. But their restriction otherwise to relative clauses and fac-
tive complements is, on the surface at least, rather puzzling. In these en-
vironments, they represent old, backgrounded information. One possible
                  Grammatical status of parataxis and serialization       265reason why they occur here and not in other sorts of embedded environ-
ments is that, as background information, the interpretation of the con-
struction is semantically unaffected by the matrix predication. Since it is
a feature of the paratactic construction when non-embedded that each
clause is taken to be separately asserted, even to the point where the second
clause is not semantically (as opposed to pragmatically) affected by the
first, this relationship between the clauses can be preserved when the con-
struction is backgrounded but not when the construction is semantically
affected by the matrix predication.
                                  Notes1. The discussion in this and other sections of the phonology draws freely
on Okello (1975), an especially valuable source since Okello is a native
speaker of Lango. However, because this grammar utilizes the speech of
several Langi, has a broader scope and a different theoretical basis, the
details of the phonology presented here differ in a number of respects
from those presented by Okello.","[276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283]"
"10.3 Transitive and intransitive verb formsOne additional comment on the use of transitive and intransitive verbal
forms should be made to put the matter in proper perspective.
256                              Structures in discourse    In Sec. 8.2.1, the 'relevance' of an argument was used as a criterion
for the choice of a Tr, AN, or SA form. But notice that relevance is not
determined grammatically as a device for promoting cohesion between
sentences in discourse. Instead, relevance refers to the overall relevance
of the argument for the discourse as a whole (or at least a subpart of the
discourse), not for any given sentence in context. For instance, in answer-
ing the question
             A. Did you eat the chicken?
the answer can not be
             B. Yes, I ate.
but rather
             B. Yes, I ate it.
If the argument was relevant for the question, it must be relevant for the
answer, because relevance is defined for discourses and not in terms of in-
tersentential predictability. Similarly, in Lango, a Tr must be the response
to a Tr question, not an AN, even though the Tr DO is predictable in this
context:
             A.   icamo gwfeno               Tr
                  2s-eat-perf chicken
                  'did you eat the chicken?'
                  \.   S   \.                      r-f-i
             B    acamo                            Tr
                  ls-eat-perf
                  Ί ate it'
The cohesive property of predictability in context is handled by
pronominalization, which for non-human DO's is accomplished by a
simple Tr verb. The predictability or relevance of an entity for the dis-
course as a whole is handled by choosing an intransitive valence scheme.
If the original question was
             A.   icemo?                           AN
                  2s-eat-perf
                  'did you eat?'
the response would be
             B.   acemo                           AN
                  ls-eat-perf
                  Ί ate'
and not
                       Transitive and intransitive verb forms            257           B.   äcämö                            Tr
                ls-eat-perf
                  ate it'
The relevance of an entity is a semantic/pragmatic affair, not a grammati-
cal cohesive one, such as substitution (nominal or verbal) and ellipsis. And
their choice of valence scheme is as fundamentally a discourse matter as
choice of verb.
                      11. Additional issues11.1 The status of subjects and topics in Lango syntaxAs the leftmost NP in unmarked sentences, the subject usually plays the role
of topic in Lango. But the subject and topic roles are more easily separable in
Lango than in English, since any argument of the predicate or associative NP
in the matrix clause or parallel clauses (Sec. 11.2) can easily assume the topic
role by being moved to sentence-initial position, and, somewhat less accept-
ably, so can arguments in subordinate predications.
     We have already discussed (Sec. 8.5.2) how topics in Lango differ from
those in 'topic-prominent' languages such as Mandarin: In Mandarin,
topics need not be arguments or associatives, whereas in Lango they must
be. However, topics in Lango and Mandarin share a number of charac-
teristics, which we will briefly summarize here. First, they must be inter-
preted as definite or generic, at least when distinct from the subject
(Noonan 1977). Second, they are interpreted as the sentence orientation,
delimiting the frame within which the rest of the sentence is interpreted;
in more traditional terms, they are what the sentence is about. And third,
they occupy leftmost position in the sentence. This latter characteristic
has an exception in Lango, namely clefted NP's, which can precede a topic-
subject, though must follow topicalized NP's.
    The function of the subject divorced from its usual role as topic is as
the highest grammatical slot in a role identification system which matches
highest grammatical slot to highest available semantic role.         In Lango,
the role hierarchy has agent as the highest role, experiencer next, fol-
lowed by patient, locative, instrument, etc. Instrument subjects scarcely
exist in Lango.
     In this section we will examine a number of properties of topics and
subjects and provide some suggestions as to why each set is associated
with the NP it is. 145
Topic propertiesThe topic is the only NP whose definiteness is assured simply because of
the grammatical slot it occupies. Out of context, of the arguments in (1),
            ( 1 ) loc» däkö ömiö buk
                 man woman 3s-give-perf book
                 'the man was given a book by the woman'
only the topic must receive a definite interpretation. Subjects must receive
a definite interpretation only when they are also topics. This guarantee
                   The status of subjects and objects in Lango syntax      259
of definiteness, setting topics apart from other arguments in the sentence,
was referred to as the 'referential prominence' of the topic by Schachter
(1977). It is this referential prominence of the topic that results in the in-
terpretation of the topic as the sentence orientation, since as the only bit
of necessarily definite, backgrounded or presupposed information, it is
the focal point of linkage of the sentence with previous discourse and back-
ground information. As such, it provides the frame within which the sen-
tence is interpreted.
    It is interesting to note that all languages seem to provide a mechanism
(apart from the simple use of demonstratives) to definitize at least one
noun per sentence. When languages lack a system of articles, topic
markers, or other indicators of presupposed status, initial position seems
to fill this function. 146 This is true for languages as diverse as Russian,
Mandarin, and Lango. The syntax and pragmatics of initial position topics
show remarkable similarities in all these languages.
    The essence of the syntactic properties of the topic is coreferentially
with other topics. The topic is the link binding the sentence to other sen-
tences in discourse, whereas the subject plays a role wholly internal to the
sentence. So, it is the topic, not the subject, that controls coreference with
adjacent and subordinate clauses:
            (1) d k Iocs όηέηό. c mmo dck
                 woman man 3s-see-perf. 3s-eat-prog stew
                 'the woman was seen by the man. She was eating stew'
            (2) dak    loca όηέηό. Ιέ d k
                 woman man 3s-see-perf. 3s-and+then-hab
                    go+back-infin
                 'the woman was seen by the man, and then she went
                     back'
            (3) dak loca όηέηό ante a mattό k5rp
                 woman man 3s-see-perf rel-part 3s-drink-prog beer
                 'the woman was seen by the man while she was
                    drinking beer'
Notice that if dak were not topicalized and the subject loca were the
topic, loc» would be interpreted as the subject of the second clause in
(1-3). As shown in Sec. 9.10, the topic also controls coreference with
switch/non-switch reference morphology. This control of coreference
is a predictable consequence of assuming the sentence orientation,
which provides the linkage not only with previous, but also with sub-
sequent, discourse.
     In Sec. 9.10, it was also noted that topics control coreference with
floated quantifiers. This is also a consequence of assuming the sentence
orientation, as pointed out by Schachter (1977) for Tagalog. The NP quan-
tified by a form like all has the property of being necessarily referential
(definite) or generic in interpretation. Sentence orientations like topics are
260                            Additional isstiesalways definite or generic, but in Lango an unqualified noun that is not
the sentence orientation may receive either a definite or indefinite inter-
pretation. If a quantifier were allowed to float away from any position other
than the sentence orientation, the noun would no longer obligatorily
receive a definite interpretation and hence a conflict could arise between
this interpretation and the obligatory definite interpretation associated
with quantified nouns. In the case of floating from a topicalized NP or a
subject NP in the absence of a topicalized NP, no such conflict arises.","[271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276]"
"
Established referentsA referent is said to be established if it is in the hearer's immediate con-
sciousness, which in discourse terms usually means that it has been men-
tioned within the last three or four sentences with no other referents
mentioned with which it may be confused. In such cases, the inflected verb
is used or, for non-humans, zero anaphora, which is functionally
equivalent to the inflected verb in Lango:
            (1) ojuk obinö päco
                O. 3s-come-perf home
250                            Structures in discourse            (2) te teddo rino
                  3s-and+then-hab cook-infin meat
            (3) te cämmo
                  3s-and+then-hab eat-infin
                  Ojuk came home. He then cooked the meat and ate it'
Established referents may also be coded as DO's, retaining topic status. In
such cases, the inflected verb will not suffice, and a topicalized pronoun
is used. For instance, the discourse above could be followed by a sentence
like
            (4)   en j5te nenne
                  him people 3s-and+then-hab see-infin-3s
                  'he was then seen by the people'
where the topic Ojuk is referenced by the pronoun     and the third sin-
gular object marking on the infinitive.
    Established referents may shift from topic to non-topic status, as in
the case of Okelo in the discourse below. As a non-topic direct object,
Okelo in (4) is referenced by the inflected verb:
            ( 1 ) okelo obedo pip
                  O. 3s-sit-per ground
            (2) teyää
                  3s-and + then-hab go-infin
            (3) te wot okko
                  3s-and+then-hab go-infin completely
            (4) ogwäg te nenne
                   . 3s-and+then-hab see-infin-3s
                  Okelo sat on the ground. He then got up and went
                     away. Then Ogwang saw him'
Reestablished referentsWhen a referent has been a topic and then loses topic status to another
referent, as in the case of Okelo in (4) in the above discourse, several
devices are available for reestablishing the referent as topic. Suppose sen-
tence (5) continues the above discourse and reestablishes Okelo as topic.
This may be done by simply using a full NP,
           (5)    okelo te rirjo
                  O. 3s-and+then-hab run-infin
                  Okelo then ran'
or by using an independent pronoun:
                               Reference in discourse                   251            (5') έη te rirjo
                 he es-and+then-hab run-infin
                 'he then ran'
The independent pronouns en and gin 'they' in subject position signal a
reestablish topic, or in some cases the beginning of a new episode (Sec.
10.2).137
     But suppose that sentence (4) above is followed by a number of sen-
tences with Ogwang as topic. In reestablishing Okelo as topic, either the
full NP is used (as in (5) above), or the reinforced subject is used:
            (6) έη okelo te rirjo
                he O. 3s-and+then-hab run-infin
                Okelo then ran'
The sole function of the reinforced subject seems to be to reestablish as
topic a referent that has not been topic for at least three or four senten-
ces. The thematic suffix -mere can also be used in such cases:
            (6') okelomere te rirjo
                 O.-theme 3s-and+then-hab run-infin
                 'then the aforementioned Okelo ran'
    Where required by the valence scheme, NP's may be reesatablished as
topics syntactically as DO's. They will take the form of topicalized NP's:           (7) okelo ja owijie wot i burj
               O. people 3s-hear-perf-3s 3s-walk-prog in forest
               Okelo was heard walking in the forest'
Notice the use of jo 'people' as a non-specific subject.","[265, 266, 267]"
"8.8 Prepositional phrasesLango has a very small set of true prepositions, which include the
following:
                  i               On, at, in, about, to, from'
                  bag             'to'(somewhat archaic)
                  bot             'to'
                  me              'for'
                  pi              'because of
                  te              'under'
                  tu              'toward'
                  kä              'instead of
                  kede (or ke)    'with'
                  ginni           'with'
Each of these prepositions except i and ginni has a characteristic set of
object pronoun affixes; the plain form is used with noun objects:                  El            bot
           Is  pxra             bot»
           2s  piri             boti
           3s  pire             böte
          IP pxwa               bötwä
          2P   piwu             bötwu
          3p Pig*               bötgi
ginni does not take pronominal objects (Sec. 8.7.5). i takes noun and
pronominal objects that refer to non-humans,
           (1)    iye             'in, about, on, etc. it'
                  i buk           'in, about, on, etc. the book'
but cannot take objects that refer directly to humans. When such nouns
or pronouns are the logical object of i, the noun kom 'body' is used as the
object of i, with the appropriate noun or pronoun as its inalienable pos-
sessor (cf Sec. 8.7.3):
           (2)    i kom däkö      'in about, on, etc. the woman'
                  i koma          'in about, on, etc. me'
                  i kömi          'in about, on, etc. you'
                       The organization of the noun phrase              171    Prepositional phrases normally consist of a preposition followed by its
NP object, or a preposition inflected for pronominal object. There are two
sorts of complications both involving i. First, prepositional phrases may
consist of i (rarely some other preposition) followed by a second preposi-
tion followed by the object:
           (1)   loca owoto ökko i bot däko
                 man 3s-walk-perf completely at to woman
                 'the man walked after the woman'
           (2)   dako öbeö i te yat
                 woman 3s-move-perf at under branch
                 'the woman walked under the branch'
           (3)   loca owoto tu bot dako
                 man 3s-walk-perf toward to woman
                 'the man walked toward the woman'
Combinations of prepositions plus preposition must be individually listed
in the lexicon because all combinations are not possible and the meaning
resulting from such combinations is not always predictable, e.g. i bot
'after, from'.
     Second, i combines with body part nouns and locational nouns to form
locative expressions:
           (1)   i wi bäkci
                 on head box
                 On top of the box'
           (2)   z dog kulu
                 on mouth river
                 On the edge of the river'
           (3)     kor ot
                 on chest house
                 'against the house'
           (4)   i yi at
                 at stomach house
                 'into, out of the house'
           (5)   i kin pern aryo
                 in space ^between bridge two
                 'between two bridges'
Notice than an inalienable associative relationship is established between
the nouns. Constructions consisting of i, a preposition, and a body part
noun are also possible:
172                        The syntax of simple sentences            (6)   i ka wag dako
                  in instead+of eye woman
                  'instead of the woman'
8.9 Interrogative constructionsYes/no questions are distinguished from their corresponding declaratives
by intonation only — there are no interrogative particles, no word order
changes, etc. Interrogative sentences of all types have a rising intonation
contour that peaks sharply on the last two syllables.
    Information questions contain interrogative words; they otherwise
possess no syntactic properties that distinguish them from their cor-
responding declaratives. The interrogative word occurs in whatever syn-
tactic slot is appropriate to its grammatical use. It is not possible to simply
front interrogative words — simple fronting is interpreted as topicaliza-
tion and interrogative words cannot be topics (Sec. 8.5.2). Initial position
may be (optionally) achieved via clefting (Sec. 9.8). Compare the declara-
tive and interrogative sentences below:
            (1)   a. okelo όηέηό όρίό
                     O. 3s-see-perf O.
                     Okelo saw Opio'
                  b. t)a όηέηο όρίό?
                     who 3s-see-perf Ο.
                     'who saw Opio?'
                  c. n ante όηέηο όρίό?
                     who rel+part 3s-see-perf O.
                     'who saw Opio?'
                  d. na έη me όηέηο όρίό?
                     who it rel+part 3s-see-perf Ο.
                     'who saw Opio?'
Note: sentence (b), where the subject is questioned directly, is a some-
what unusual sentence in Lango and may simply be a product of English
influence. 1 1 1 In my notes, such constructions only occur as transla-
tions of English sentences. In context, (c), which consists of the inter-
rogative pronoun followed by a relative clause, is the usual mode of
questioning subjects, but (d), a cleft construction, is also possible. The
reason for the (apparent) unacceptability of (b) as a fully native con-
struction is that in (b) the interrogative pronoun rja is found in clause-
initial position and therefore should receive a definite, topical
interpretation, which it cannot, (c) as a relative clause and (d) as a focus
(i.e. contrastive) cleft construction do not violate the aforementioned
                           Interrogative constructions                 173topic-first principle. In questioning the direct object, as we see in (e),
the interrogative pronoun is not frontal.
                 e. ökelö        ijä?
                    O. 3s-see-perf who
                    'who did Okelo see?'
           (2)   a. loca omio pa la bot rwöt
                    man 3s-give-perf knife to king
                    'the man gave the knife to the king'
                 b. Ioc9 omio palä bot ga?
                    man 3s-give-perf knife to who
                    'who did the man give the knife to?'
           (3)   a. äbwor tie kän
                    lion 3s-be+present-hab here
                    'the lion is here'
                 b. äbwor tie kakwene?
                    lion 3s-be+present-hab where
                    'where is the lion?'
           (4)   a. dokkapol
                    cows att+part many
                    'many cows'
                 b. dokkadi?
                    cows att+part how+many
                    'how many cows?'
           (5)   a. aneno dyänni
                    1 s-see-perf cow-this
                       saw this cow'
                 b. aneno dyannene?
                    1 s-see-perf cow-which
                    'which cow did I see?'
          'which' shares with its English counterpart the capacity to be
both a pronoun and a noun modifier: in the latter capacity, it does not
occur with the attributive particle a:
           (1)   mene ä ikwäpo?
                 which att+part 2s-get-perf
                 'which one did you get?'
           (2)   ätin mene a ineno?
                 child which att+part 2s-see-perf
                 'which child did you see?'
174                             The syntax of simple sentencesAs a noun modifier, it may function either as an independent word or
as an enclitic. In the latter case, the initial /m/ is subject to cluster
simplification (Sec. 1.2.3):
            (3)     kül     ?
                    warthog which
                    'which warthog?'
            (4)     kullene?
                    warthog-which
                    'which warthog?'
Notice that when it functions as a clitic, rnene is not subject to vowel
harmony.","[186, 187, 188, 189, 190]"

A note on transcription
Apart from some early section of the phonology where phonetic symbols
are used, the transcription employed in this grammar is an adaptation of
what has come to be the standard orthography for Lango, modified so as
to show tone, vowel quality, and gemination. Except where phonological
derivations are discussed, the transcription presupposes the application
of tone sandhi and coalescence word internally. The tone sandhi and
coalescence rules are applied in external sandhi in Part I, Phonology, and
Part II, Morphology, so as to provide examples of the application of the
rules, but not in Part III, Syntax, so as not to impede morpheme iden-
tification and to comply with the conventions of Lango orthography. It is
hoped that this will provide no inconvenience to the reader.
     The phonetic symbols are discussed in Sec. 1.1 for consonants, 2.1 for
vowels, and 4.1 for tones. The symbols used in the modified standard or-
thography are given in Sec. 1.3 for consonants and 2.4 for vowels.

                            IntroductionLango is a member of the Lwo subgroup of Western Nilotic, a branch of
the Nilotic languages, which in turn are members of the Nilo-Saharan
family (Greenberg 1966). Nilo-Saharan as a whole is a rather poorly
studied group despite the fact that the languages are distributed over a
large area in the Eastern Sahel and East Africa.
    Lango is spoken entirely within Uganda. The population is located
primarily in Lango province, north of Lake Kyoga in central Uganda.
Lango is most closely allied, both in grammar and lexicon, to Acholi, and
somewhat more distantly to Luo and Alur. Tucker (1957) and Tucker and
Bryan (1966) have asserted that the Langi originally spoke an Eastern
Nilotic language and, since moving to their present habitat, have taken
up a form of Western Nilotic (but compare Driberg (1923) on this point).
Numerous apparent relics, both syntactical and lexical, can be found which
may attest to this earlier linguistic affiliation, though the evidence needs
to be very carefully assessed to determine whether these are relics or some
sort of adstratum.
    The Lango language which is the subject of this study is distinct from
that of two groups of people living in the Sudan who are sometimes also
referred to as 'Lango.' One of these speaks an eastern Nilotic language
closely related to Lotuko; the other, usually referred to as Didinga, speaks
a Surma language.
    In recent years, the Langi have been a politically important group
within Uganda. During the period of the Amin regime and the civil war
that followed, the Langi people suffered greatly and many were killed or
went into exile. Estimates of the number of Langi vary from 300,000
(Okello, 1975) to 823,200 (Grimes, 1988). Many Langi have some
knowledge of English.
    There is very little published work on Lango. The earliest and most
useful work is Driberg (1923) which contains a short grammar and a dic-
tionary. While this is a most valuable work, it is seriously flawed in a num-
ber of crucial areas. Driberg discusses syntax only incidentally and
sparsely in the course of his treatment of morphology and, in addition,
tends to over-morphologize, i.e. to represent in single words sequences
of independent (and separable) words. The tone system of Lango is al-
most completely ignored. In his transcription of vowels, Driberg fails to
note the distinctions based on advanced versus retracted tongue root,
thereby cutting the vowel inventory in half. The effects of this transcrip-
tional inadequacy extend beyond mere failure to note phonological
processes such as vowel harmony, and differences between lexical items.
For example, Driberg fails to recognize grammatical categories such as
2                               Introductionthe aspect distinctions in the verbal paradigms, which are frequently dis-
tinguished only by tone.
     Tucker and Bryan (1966) provide the only other grammatical infor-
mation, presenting a few features of Lango grammar in a chapter giving
a general overview of Western Nilotic. Also in a comparative vein is Blount
and Curley (1970) which compares Lango vocabulary, in the form of
Swadesh's 100 and 200 word lists, with other closely related Western
Nilotic languages.
     Other literature on Lango is concerned with specific aspects of Lango
phonology and syntax. Tucker (1958) is a valuable discussion of segmen-
tal and tonemic phenomena at word boundaries. Maddieson, Shopen and
Okello (1974), Clifton (1975), and Dwyer (1983) discuss Lango tonemics,
while Okello (1975) discusses both tonemic and segmental phonology. The
last four works are written in a generative framework. Dwyer (1983) and
Bavin (1982) compare Lango with Southern Lwo kin.
     Brief mention of Lango is also made in the following works: Tucker
(1955), Hall et al (1955), and Greenberg (1966).
     Newspapers, pedagogical materials, and some literary works have
been published in Lango. A complete translation of the Bible has been
available since 1979. There are also radio broadcasts in the language. Per-
sonal correspondence between Langi, however, is likely to be in English,
the language of schools, higher literacy, and the courts in Uganda.
    The primary material upon which this work is based was collected over
a period of several years, from 1977 to 1983, from consultants residing in
Buffalo, New York, and Los Angeles. A number of Lango speakers served
as consultants, chief among them were Mary Okello, Jonas Opio, Florence
Monday, and George Ojuk. To all of them I express my gratitude. In ad-
dition to data collected from consultants, textual material collected by
Driberg (1923) was also used, as were short stories written by Langi.
    I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Wally Chafe, Bob
Kirsner, Paul Schachter, and Sandy Thompson for helpful comments at
various stages in the production of this work. I would like to give special
thanks first to Chet Creider, whose detailed comments greatly improved
the work, and second, but most importantly, to Edith Bavin, with whom
much of the data were collected and with whom I worked out the prelimi-
nary analysis of the grammar.
    And lastly, I would like to thank Dean Andrade, who designed and
typed the final camera-ready version.

8.5.1 Variation in the placement of the indirect objectThe syntax of lO's was discussed in Section 1.1 and will only be summarized
here. The IO can be placed immediately after the verb, in which case it,
and not the DO, conditions object verb agreement. Alternately, the IO can
be made the object of bot 'to' and placed after the DO:
           (1)   rwot omiya dyarj
                 king 3s-give-perf-ls cow
                 'the king gave me a cow'
           (2)   rwot ömiö dyärj bota
                 king 3s-give-perf cow to-Is
                 'the king gave the cow to me'
    There are fewer constraints on datives assuming the advanced posi-
tion (and hence making anaphora on the verb) than in English. 101 For in-
stance there is no general constraint restricting advanced lO's with
pronominalized DO's, as in English:
           (3)   *the king gave me it
In Lango non-human third person anaphora is indicated by transitive
verb alone: Both advanced and non-advanced (i.e. with bot) lO's are
possible:
           (4)   rwot omiya
                 king 3s-give-perf-ls
                 'the king gave it to me'
           (5)   rwot omio bota
                 king 3s-give-perf to-ls
                 'the king gave it to me'
However, if a human third person DO pronoun is present, only the non-
advanced IO is possible:
           (6)   rwot ocwale bota
                 king 3s-send-perf-3s to-ls
                 'the king sent him to me'
150                        The syntax of simple sentences            (7)   *rwot öcwälä en
                  king 3s-send-perf-ls him
                  'the king sent me him'
This, however, simply reflects the more general constraint that object
pronouns must be attached to their head (either verb or preposition); inde-
pendent pronouns (like en) can only be used in addition to the suffixed
pronouns for contrastive emphasis in post-verbal position. Advanced and
non-advanced lO's do not differ semantically in the sense that there will be
no truth value differences between them, but they do differ pragmatically.
Lango has no system of articles for indicating definiteness, and though cer-
tain nominal affixes such as the demonstratives can be used for this pur-
pose, they are not regularly employed in this way. Definiteness must be
inferred from previous discourse and background knowledge, aided by
placement of the NP within the sentence. Generally speaking, the closer an
NP is to the front of the sentence, the more likely it is to be interpreted as
definite. Since indirect objects, on straightforward pragmatic grounds, are
highly likely to be definite anyway, ' it is the placement of the DO that is
most affected by the possibilities illustrated in (1) and (2) above. When the
DO is last, as in (1) it is more likely to receive an indefinite interpretation
than when it is followed by the IO as in (2). The glosses provided for the
sentences reflect this.","[165, 166]"
"
8.7.5 Conjunction of NP's and adjectivesThere is no true symmetric conjunction of NP's in Lango. Instead, as-
symetric coordination with prepositions is used. The usual preposition is
kede 'with' (rarely ke) whose other uses include expression of instrument:
            (1)   okelo kede ojuk ocamo dek
                  O. with O. 3s-eat-perf stew
                  Okelo and Ojuk ate the stew'
The verb is conjugated for third person singular, agreeing with the true
subject Okelo rather than the plural sense. When a first person singular
reference is included among the conjuncts, it is usual to use the first
person plural pronoun as the head, in a sense summing up the totality
of the conjunction:
                         The organization of the noun phrase                  163            (2)   wan kedi oca mo dek
                  we with-2s 1 p-eat-perf stew
                  'you and I ate the stew'
The verb in such cases takes first person plural concord. Notice that kede
like other prepositions, is conjugated for person. The object of kede may
be topicalized (or relativized on — Sec. 9.2):
            (3)   yfn wan kedi ocamo dek
                  you we with-2s 1 p-eat-perf stew
                  'you and I ate the stew'
When more than two NP's are coordinated, kede need not be repeated
before each conjunct, only before the last, though such repetition is more
frequent than the analogous repetition of and in English:
            (4)   wan okelo kede l b ocamo dek
                  we O. with A. 1 p-eat-perf stew
                  Okelo, Alaba, and I ate the stew'
Note the ambiguity of the following:
            (5)   okelo omato c y kede c k
                  O. 3s-drink-perf tea with milk
                  Okelo drank tea with milk' or
                  Okelo drank tea and milk'
   Another preposition in this class is ginni 'with'. A peculiarity of this
form is that the NP's linked with it cannot be pronouns, but must be nouns:
            (6)   apwo ginni kwac nwoijo obedo owote
                  H. with L. 3s-find-perf 3s-stay-perf friends
                  'Hare and Leopard were friends'
kede, ke, and ginni can all be used to express accompaniment; ginni can-
not be used for instruments. See Sec. 8.11.3 for the relation between NP
conjunction and accompaniment.
    Disjunction is accomplished with όρο, which is the third person singular
perfective of poo 'to be possible', όρο is frequently used as a parenthetical
meaning 'maybe, perhaps', and this use seems to underlie its role in disjunction:
            (1)   d koopoobino
                  woman 3s-be+possible-perf 3s-come perf
                  'maybe the woman came'
            (2)   d k ορό loca obin
                  woman 3s-be+possible-perf man 3s-come-perf
                  'either the woman or the man came'
            (3)   an όρο yin abino
                  I 3s-be + possible-perf you ls-come-perf
                  'either you or I came'
164                        The syntax of simple sentencesExample (3) shows that the noun before όρο is the grammatical subject,
determining subject agreement. Neither disjunct can be felicitously
topicalized.
    The interpretation of the disjunction with ορό, which can occur in all
sentential positions,
            (4)     tin oc mo rec όρο riijo
                  child 3s-eat-perf fish 3s-be-t-possible-perf meat
                  'the child ate fish or meat'
is that one or the other, but not both holds. So in (4), the child ate either
fish or meat, but not both. Despite its origin as a verb and its additional
meaning of'maybe, perhaps', όρο is a true conjunction, as examples like
(4) clearly show. If όρο were not a conjunction, one might expect (4) to
assert that fish had been eaten, and to leave open the additional possibility
of meat as well. As it is, the interpretation of rec is within the disjunction
created by ορό.
     In comparing όρο with kede, όρο creates true symmetric coordinate
structures whereas kede (and ginnf) does not. Compare, for example, their
behavior vis- -vis topicalization noted above. Constructions with όρο obey
Ross' (1967) Coordinate Structure Constraint, where those with kede do
not (see also Sec. 9.6).
     There is no Lango equivalent of
            (1)   Okelo, but not Opio, came
entS 'but' can only be used to coordinate full sentences. (1) would have to
be translated as (2):
            (2)   okelo obino Ento όρίό pe obino
                  O. 3s-come-perf but O. neg 3s-come-perf
                  Okelo came, but Opio didn't come'
   Adjectives are coordinated by simple juxtaposition, both in their
predicatival and attributive functions:
            (1)   yin itek iryek
                  you 2s-strong-hab 2s-wise-hab
                  'you are strong and wise'
            (2)   ageo loca tek a ryek
                  ls-know-hab man att+part strong att+part wise
                  Ί know a strong and wise man'
Disjunction is accomplished with όρο:
            (3)   yin itek όρο iryek
                  you 2s-strong-hab 3s-be + possible-perf 2s-wise-hab
                  'you are strong or wise'
                        The organization of the noun phrase              165           (4)    arjeo loca    tek όρο a ryek
                  ls-know-hab man att+part strong 3s-be+possible-perf
                     att+part wise
                  Ί know the man who is strong or wise'
8.7.6 PronominaleIndependent personal pronouns basically occur only as subjects and topi-
calized NP's; in other positions, personal pronouns appear as suffixes on
verbs, prepositions, or nouns (when associatives):
            (1)   an akvpo bur             (subject)
                  I ls-dig-perf hole
                  Ί dug a hole'
            (2)   an loca onena        (topic)
                  I man 3s-see-perf-ls
                  Ί was seen by the man'
However, independent pronouns may occasionally occur in other positions
in addition to the suffixed pronouns when indicating emphatic contrast,
            (3)   loca oncna an
                  man 3s-see-perf-ls I
                  'the man saw me!'
though the cleft construction is more usual in this function (see Sec. 10.1).
Independent subject pronouns are, like other subject NP's, not obligatory,
the inflection on the verb clearly marking person and number:
           (4)     kijrji bur
                  ls-dig-perf hole
                  Ί dug a hole'
They are always present when some contrast is intended or when there
is a change of topic. First or second person pronouns are used frequently
in other contexts as well and are much more frequent than, say, their
Spanish counterparts, even though the Lango verb is equally well
inflected for subject.
     Demonstrative pronouns, together with their use as true pronominals,
           (1)    man odoko a tek okko
                  this 3s-become-perf att+part hard completely
                  'this has become hard'
may also substitute for the demonstrative affixes:
           (2)    a. okelo okwano bukki
                     O. 3s-read-perf book-this
                     Okelo read this book'
166                        The syntax of simple sentences
                  b. okelo ökwänö buk man
                     O. 3s-read-perf book this
                     Okelo read this book'
   Indefinite pronouns do not, per se, exist in Lango. In their place,
generic nouns are used:
            (1)   aneno rjat
                  1 s-see-perf person
                     saw someone'
Negative indefinites are discussed in Sec. 9.11.
    The reflexive pronoun is ken- to which inalienable associative affixes are
added. This is optionally used together with middle voice morphology when
the subject is interpreted as coreferential with the notional direct object:
            (1)   onekere
                  3s-kill-mid-perf
                  'he killed himself
            (2)   onekere kene
                  3s-kill-mid-perf self-3sa
                  'he killed himself
            (3)   onekere kengi
                  3p-kill-mid-perf self-Spa
                  'they killed themselves'
Its use is obligatory, however, when the subject is coreferential with the
object of a preposition or benefactive. In such cases, both the preposition
(or verb) and ken- are inflected for person and number:
            (4)   öbote olego obarja pire kene
                  O. 3s-pray-perf God because+of-3s self-3sa
                  Obote prayed to God about himself
            (5)   äläbä öwille kene buk
                  A. 3s-buy-ben-perf-3s self-3sa book
                  'Alaba bought herself a book'
When not associated with the middle voice, an inflected preposition, or
the benefactive, k«n- means 'alone':
            (6)   äbinö kena
                  1 s-come-perf self-1 sa
                     came alone'8.7.7 Expression of number; number concordMany Lango nouns, particularly those referring to humans and animals,
have distinctive plural forms. There is no regular plural formation in
                          The organization of the noun phrase              167Lango, so each singular/plural pair must be individually lexicalized:
            (1)    a. däko              mon
                      woman             women
                   b. äwobi             awobe
                      boy               boys
                   c. dyäg              dok
                      cow               cows
                   d. gwök
                      dog               dogs
                   e. buk               buke
                      book              books
                   f. gweno             gwen
                      chicken          chickens
                   g. ägäk              ägakan
                      crow              crows
Recently borrowed nouns tend to form their plurals with the suffix -e. See
Sec. 5.2.5 for a discussion of the formation of plural nouns.
    A large number of nouns do not have distinctive plural forms. Most
nouns referring to body parts, implements, location, fruits, trees and
vegetables are in this class. These nouns can still be quantified, however:
            (1 )   gulu äcel
                   pot one
                   One pot'
            (2)    gulu aryo
                   pot two
                   'two pots'
            (3)    gulu a nok
                   pot att+part few
                   'few pots'
            (4)    gulu a pol
                   pot att+part many
                   'many pots'
     Even when a noun has a distinctive plural, as subject it takes third per-
son singular concord. The third plural forms are used only with zero sub-
ject and with the pronoun gin 'they':
            (1)    otoo
                   3p-die-perf
                   'they died'
168                         The syntax of simple sentences           (2)   gin ötoö
                 they 3p-die-perf
                 'they died'
           (3)   gwok otoo
                 dog 3s-die-perf
                 'the dog died'
           (4)   gwoggi oto5
                 dogs 3s-die-perf
                 'the dogs died'
           (5)   gulu otoo
                 pot 3s-die-perf
                 'the pot/pots broke'
           (6)   gulu ädek otbä
                 pot three 3s-die-perf
                 'three pots broke'
However, adjectives, whether predicate or attributive, agree with the sense
of the noun:
           (1)   gulu rac
                 pot 3s-bad-hab
                 'the pot is no good'
           (2)   gulu recu
                 pots 3s-bad-pl-hab
                 'the pots are no good'
With a topicalized subject, the pronoun, not the noun, determines the form
of the verb:
           (3)   rwodi gin ömäro k5tp
                 kings they 3p-like-hab beer
                 'kings, they like beer'
    Even when nouns have distinctive plurals, they are not always used.
For example, one hears
           (1)   gwökkäpol
                 dog att+part many
                 'many dogs'
alongside the expected:
           (2)   gwoggi a pol
                 dogs att+part many
                 'many dogs'

tive verb, can be placed immediately after the verb instead of its usual
position within the NP:
            (1)   awobe ducu odok pi rwot
                  boys all 3s-go+back-perf because+of king
                  'all the boys went back because of the king'
            (2)   awobe odok ducu pi rwot
                  boys 3s-go+back-perf all because+of king
                  'the boys all went back because of the king'
The quantifier in (2) is a 'floated' quantifier.
    Another unique property of ducu is its ability to be 'stranded' by
relativization, cleft, and topicalization:
            (3)   a. d k o l kede xtin ducu
                     woman 3s-be+tired-hab with children all
                     'the woman is tired of all the children'
                  b. itin dak o l kedgi ducu
                     children woman 3s-be+tired-hab with-3p all
                     'the children, the woman is tired of them all'
            (4)   a. rwot οηέηό gwoggi ducu
                     king 3s-see-perf dogs all
                     'the king saw all the dogs'
                  b. gwoggi rwot όηέηό ducu
                     dogs king 3s-see-perf all
                     'the dogs were all seen by the king'
Other modifiers may not be stranded, ducu may, of course, be part of the
topic NP:
                  c. gwoggi ducu rwot όηέηό
                     dogs all king 3s-see-perf
                     'all the dogs were seen by the king'
    When ducu is floated, as in (2), or stranded, as in (4b), it is always be-
cause it and not its head is within the scope of assertion. For instance, (1)
would be an appropriate answer to (5), where w be ducu is topical in-
formation in both sentences:
            (5)   awobe ducu odok pirjo?
                  boys all 3s-go+back-perf why
                  'why did all the boys go back?'
But (2) would be an appropriate answer to (6):
170                       The syntax of simple sentences            (6)   äwobe adi adok pi rwot

                  'how many boys went back because of the king?'
In (2), ducu is what is asserted.","[178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186]"

5.7 Numerals5.7.1 Cardinal numeralsThe basic cardinal numbers are:           (D     1    acel              6     abicel       100         mi»
                  2    aryo              7     abiryo       1000        tutumia
                  3    adele             8     aboro        1,000,000   milion
                  4    änwen             9     abonwen
                  5    able              10    apär
All other cardinal numbers are formed from combinations of the numbers
given above.
    The numbers 1 through 10 have a prefix a-. It might seem that this
prefix is the attributive particle (or some combination including the at-
tributive particle) now conventionally prefixed to these numerals. Regard-
less of its origin, it is now used even when these numerals are said in
isolation and when they are used as predicates: in neither case would one
expect the attributive particle.
    6 through 9 were originally compounds:
                                         HSl                 FS1          70
           (2)    ä-bic # eel            -^      abic eel    -»    abic eel73In contemporary Lango, it would be impossible to derive the rest in any
straightforward fashion (8 in particular has an idiosyncratic base for 3).
Lango speakers, in any case, claim that these are unitary forms, not com-
pounds.
    Numbers 11 through 19 are formed by combining the unit numeral
to 10 apär by means of wie, literally 'its head', but here meaning some-
thing like Over it':
           (3)    ll      apär wie acel
                  12      apär wie äryo
                          v          x
                   0        '    ^ ^ l *l
                  13      apär wie adek
                  l4      apär wie ärjwen
                              etc.

Despite the fact that -e in wie is a pronominal suffix, it is lost in coales-
cence with the following ä- prefix (Sec. 2.7),
            (4)     18     apärwiäborö
except in careful speech. In fact, wie can be omitted altogether in infor-
mal styles:
            (5)     19     äparäbonwen
    Numbers above 19 do not begin with the ä- prefix. 20, 30, 40, etc. are
formed by counting 10's. The plural of äpär is pyer:75
            (6)     20     pyer aryS
                    30     pyer adek
                    40     pyer agwen
                    90     pyer abonwen
Units are added with wie as described above:
            (7)     21     pyer aryS wie äcel
                    34     pyer adek wie änwen
                    57     pyer äbic wie äbiryö
                    95     pyer abonwen wie äbic
mia 100, tütümia 1000, and müiön 1,000,000 have no plural forms:
            (8)      100         mi a acel
                     400         mia anwen
                     1000        tütümia äcel
                     6000        tütümia äbicel
                   "" 24,000      tütümia pyer änwen
                     9,000,000   milion äbonwen
Units are added to these numbers in the usual way:
            (9)     108          mia äcel wie äboro
However, larger numbers are added with i 'with' (r and wie are not inter-
changeable):
            (10)    146        mia äcel i pyer ärjwen wie äbicel
                    72,468,396 milion pyer äbiryö wie aryS, i tütumia
                               ärjwen pyer äbicel wie äboro, i mia
                               ade k i pyer äborjwcn wie äbicel
   Numbers follow the words they quantify:
           (11)    dok aryo                   'two head of cattle'
                   dok mia äcel i pyer
                      äbic wie äboro          ' 158 head of cattle'
   The system of cardinal numbers described above corresponds in al-
most all details to that of Acholi. Earlier in this century, this was not the
112                        The structure of Lango words                                                                      77
case. Driberg (1923) has 1-4 the same as in present day Lango/' but the
higher numbers are different — Driberg's orthography is used below:
            (12)   5       kany
                   6       kany kape
                   10      tömon
                   11      tomon ape
                   20      atömon aryö
                   100     atömon tömon, tolgag, or tol
These numbers are probably Southern Nilotic in origin and have been
used as evidence for the Southern Nilotic origins of the Lango people.
Compare Teso 5 a-kapx.
    These numbers survive only among old people and are only imper-
fectly known among younger people. The following Old-style' numbers
have been recorded:
            (13)   5       käp
                   6       käp ape
                   100     ätumüro äcel
5.7.2 Ordinal numbersOrdinal numbers (or, at least, the translations of English ordinal num-
bers) are formed by either of two methods:
            (1)    dyän mera'cel              'the first cow'
            (2)    dyäi) äcellere             'the first cow'
In (1), the prepositional phrase mere, 3s of mi'for', is placed between the
head noun and the numeral. (Exceptionally, the pronominal suffix is lost
in coalescence.) In (2), the alienable associative suffix -mere is attached to
the numeral. (2) can also mean 'his/her one cow'.","[126, 127, 128]"
"
8.11.4 Manner and degreeThere are two common ways to form manner expressions. The first invol-
ves adjectives (always in their singular forms) and the atrributive particle
ä. They may be reduplicated (as in (1) and (2)) and always follow the verb
they modify:
           (1}   kom ätin tie ädok a beber
                 body child 3s-be+present-hab 3s-go+back-prog
                    att-f part good
                 'the child is becoming well'
           (2)   loca otiyo a cecek
                 man 3s-work-perf att+part short
                 'the man worked briefly'
           (3)   ajwate ä tek
                 ls-hit-perf-3s att+part hard
                   hit him hard'
There is no difference, then, in the form of adjectives used adverbially
and their form as modifiers of nouns. The attributive particle is used for
both; they both follow the forms they modify.
    The second method involves 'descriptive adverbs'. Descriptive adverbs
are always preceded by the particle ni. Unlike the adjectives described
above, which can be used attributively, predicatively, and adverbially,
descriptive adverbs never have another grammatical function. Further,
they appear to be lexically isolated in the sense that they are not deriva-
tively related to nouns, verbs or adjectives. There are a large number of
descriptive adverbs, and they are frequently encountered:
           (1)   obedo ni Iwaje
                 3s-sit-perf part clumsily
                 'she sat clumsily'
           (2)   pämo cem ni mw»k-mw»k
                 3s-chew-hab food part noisily
                 'he chews food noisily'
182                       The syntax of simple sentences
           (3)   kome my el ni beg-beg
                 body-3sa 3s-shake-hab part with-embarrassment
                 'he shakes with embarrassment'
           (4)   opoto i pi ni cabul
                 3s-drop-perf in water part with+a+plop
                 'he dropped it in the water with a plop'
           (5)   odxlo böno ni gig
                 3s-pack-perf clothes part full
                 'she packed the clothes to the rim'
Some descriptive adverbs appear to be onomatopoeic (e.g. mwak-mwak
'noisily'). The vowel , otherwise rather rare in Lango, frequently oc-
curs in these words. Notice that their manner of reduplication is dif-
ferent from the CiV- reduplication of adjectives, resembling instead
reduplicated nouns, the forms given as reduplicated always appear in
that form.
    Descriptive adverbs often occur with bedo 'to sit, stay' as their main
verb, in which case they may translate English predicate adjectives:
           (1)   obedonigog
                 3s-sit-perf part thin
                 'he was thin, emaciated'
           (2)   ädwög obedo ni gog
                 old-person 3s-sit-perf part stiff
                 'the old one was stiff, dried up'
They cannot, however, function as predicate adjectives without bedo, un-
like true adjectives.
    Prepositional phrases can also be used to express manner in simplex
sentences, but they are of much less frequency in this role than the two
constructions discussed above. An example:
           (1)   yin itimö kede kumu
                 you 2s-do-perf with grief
                 'you did it with a grieving manner'
    The manner preforms are amanno and amanni, which consist of the
attributive particle a, the demonstrative proform man 'this', and the
demonstrative suffixes -no 'that' and -ni 'this':
           (1)   ja ducu temö amänno
                 people all 3s-try-hab like+that
                 'all people try like that'
   The p r i m a r y degree adverb is tutwal. It can modify verbs or other
adverbs:
                          Expression of adverbial notions                183            1l)   ämarö entebbe tütwäl
                  ls-like-hab E. very+much
                    like Entebbe very much'
            (2)   ade änwoggo tek tütwäl
                  ls-be+present-hab ls-find-prog hard very
                  'I'm finding it very hard'
            (3)   an kec anekkä tütwäl
                  I hunger 3s-kill-perf-ls very
                  Tm really hungry'
Another common degree expression is pe tweeri, the negative particle and
the third singular middle habitual of tweero 'to be able'. It translates the
English 'very much, really' and is used only to modify actions:
            (1)   atin akok a pe tweere
                  child 3s-cry-prog att+part neg 3s-be+able-mid-hab
                  'the child is really crying'
Gerunds can also translate English degree expressions:
            (1)   yo bor
                  way 3s-long-hab
                  'the way is long'
           (2)    yo bor äborä
                  way 3s-long-hab long-ger
                  'the way is really long'
Similarly, reduplicated adjectives have the sense of a degree expression:
           (3)    yo bobor
                  way 3s-long-hab
                  'the way is pretty long'
    Other degree expressions are formed by complex constructions with
verbs such as rem 'to be insufficient' (Sec. 9.9.3).","[197, 198, 199]"
"
   When plural and associative affixes combine in a single word, the
order is:
           (1)   Root + Plural + Associative
    The plural and associative affixes combine in the usual way, subject
to the ordinary rules of tone sandhi and vowel harmony. The plural suf-
fixes are not deleted by contraction:

or topicality and are referred to collectively as determiners. The deictic
affixes express three relations of spatial deixis:6^
            (1)    -ni          'this: near the speaker'
                   -no          'that: near the hearer'
                   ""ca          'yonder: remote from speaker and hearer'
                   -ka
    As in many other languages, the essentially locative reference of these
forms may be extended metaphorically into temporal or psychological
dimensions. The syntax of these forms is discussed in Sec. 8.7.1 and 8.7.4.
See Sec. 1.2.3 for discussion of cluster simplification vis-ä-vis these forms
and Sec. 2.5.2 for their role in vowel harmony.
    -ni has a little used plural counterpart -gi. Its use seems confined to
nouns which lack distinctive plurals, thereby insuring for them a plural
interpretation. It is not obligatory with these forms, however, and it was
never recorded spontaneously on any noun otherwise marked for
plurality. So, guluni can mean either 'this pot' or 'these pots' since gulu
has no distinctive plural; however, gulugi can only mean 'these pots'. The
noun gwoggi 'dogs' is distinctively marked for plurality (the singular is
gwök): both gwoggini and gwoggigi therefore mean 'these pots', but only
the former is likely to be heard.
    -no also has a plural counterpart -go, but this form was never spon-
taneously offered, even with words like gulu. Nonetheless, gulugo was un-
derstood as meaning 'those pots' though one informant complained it
sounded more like Luo than Lango.
    -cä and -ka are synonymous, but -ka is quite rare. -ca/-ka have a little
used plural counterpart -ica, which is found only after words ending in
consonants. Like -cä itself, the initial / / in this form is not subject to vowel
harmony, -icä conditions gemination of preceding consonants.

     The thematic suffix -mere (see Sec. 8.7.4) has no plural counterpart.
It is phonologically identical to the 3sa alienable affix -mere so that forms
like gwenomere can mean either 'the aforementioned chicken' or 'his/her
chicken'.
     The indefinite suffix is -moro, which has a plural counterpart -mogo
(Sec. 8.7.4). As with the deictic suffixes, the plural form is not obligatory
with nouns with a plural sense.

the type of anaphoric process used. For subjects, there is a four member
system of oppositions for the representation of NP's:

           (1) loca ocem
                man 3s-eat-perf

Cleft is available for nouns and pronouns in most sentential positions (Sec-
tions 9.8, 9.9). In this section we will examine a number of factors that in-
fluence the distribution of these forms.","[262, 263, 264]"

Introducing a referentReferents in Lango are introduced to discourses by the unsurprising device
of using full NP's, unless the referent is both known and in the forefront of
attention of both speaker and hearer, in which case inflected verbs are likely
to be used. Notice that reference to speaker and hearer (first and second per-
son referents, respectively) are by definition known and in the forefront of
attention, and so full NP's are not used. When the addressee is not certain, as
in the case of a person shouting into a crowd, a vocative NP may be used, in
                              Reference in discourse                       249addition to the usual second person reference. Vocatives precede the sentence,
occasionally follow it, most often as afterthoughts:
            (1) okelo, bin kän
                 O. 2s-come-imper here
                 Okelo, come here'
    In regard to introduced third person referents not in the forefront of
attention of both speaker and hearer, their syntactic placement depends
on their status as topics, or sentence orientations. Referents intended as
discourse topics are introduced as subjects. If further identification is
necessary, this is accomplished by introducing the referent as the subject
of an indentification sentence:
            ( 1 ) ogwäg äwobi arne papperc rwot
                  O. boy rel + part father-3sa king
                  Ogwang is a boy whose father is a king'
New referents, which are not discourse topics are typically introduced as
objects:
            (2) okelo ödök päco. onworjo tottere
                O. 3s-go+back-perf home. 3s-find-perf mother-3sa
                Okelo went back home. He found his mother'
In (2), toto 'mother' is introduced into the discourse. New referents in-
tended as main characters in a narrative may be introduced like discourse
topics.
     Since Lango organizes its sentences along an old-new continuum, new
referents that are unknown to the hearer (i.e. indefinites) must be intro-
duced towartd the end of the sentence. The only exceptions are nouns
marked with -morS, which marks indefinites (Sec. 8.7.4). Nouns so marked
may occupy subject position, and since the subject is an obligatory con-
stituent of a Lango sentence, some sentence types, for instance existen-
tials, virtually require subjects marked with -moro.","[264, 265]"
"
8.2.2 The middle voiceThe basic function of the middle voice in Lango is to signal that the sub-
ject is affected by the action of the verb. The middle includes reflexive
and reciprocal senses, as well as an SA sense. '      All uses of the middle
include the sense of the subject as an 'affected entity' (Klaimann 1988).
Like passive, middle voice presupposes an active, transitive counterpart,
and also like passive, middle sentences are intransitive.
     The intransitivity of the Lango middle is evident even in its reflexive
use, in contrast to the English reflexive, which is syntactically transitive.
 In English, the reflexive pronouns, myself,yourself, etc., function as DO's.
The Lango middle is formed by adding a suffix to a Tr verb stem: - if
C2 is alveolar or zero, and -ere if C2 is non-alveolar. The suffix -e is
accompanied by gemination of C2 throughout the verbal paradigm. (See
Sec. 5.3.4 for details.) These suffixes simply code middle voice and do
not agree with the Su, as do the cognate reflexive pronoun affixes in
closely related Luo:
            (1)   Luo               Lango
                  älwokarä          älwokere                 washed myself
                  ilwokori          ilwakere                'you washed yourself
                  61w6kore          olwikcre                'she washed herself
    Many verb roots that lack an SA stem construct an SA valence scheme
with the middle voice (Sec. 8.2.1):
            (2)   a. atin ocego doggala                            Tr
                     child 3s-close-perf door
                     'the child closed the door'
                  b. doggola ocegere                               SA-Middle

                     meat 3s-cook-mid-perf
                     'the meat cooked'

                     I ls-melt-perf ice
                       melted the ice'
                  b. peeameeye                            SA-Middle
                     ice 3s-melt-mid-prog
                     'the ice is melting'
When an SA stem exists, it, and not the middle voice, is used for an SA
valence scheme. As in the case of SA stems, the SO use of the middle does
not constitute a passive. (4b), for example carries no more implication of
an external agency than does its English translation.
     The middle is used also for a reflexive when the subject is coreferen-
tial with the logical direct object:
            (1)   gwokokaaye
                  dog 3s-bite-med-perf
                  'the dog bit itself
The reflexive pronoun ken- (Sec. 8.7.6) is optional in such cases:
            (2)   gwök okaaye kene
                  dog 3s-bite-mid-perf self-3sa
                  'the dog bit itself
The middle is not used when the subject is coreferential with an argument
other than the direct object:
            (3)   okelo okobbi äläba pire kenfe
                  O. 3s-say-ben-perf A. about-3s self-3sa
                  Okelo talked to Alaba about himself
The middle also has a reciprocal sense:
            (4)   gin ogooye
                  they 3p-beat-mid-perf
                  'they are beating each other'
(4) could also mean 'they are beating themselves'. However, if this latter
meaning is intended, ken- would likely be used as this reinforces the
reflexive sense:
            (5)   gin ögoöye kengi
                  they 3p-beat-mid-perf self-Spa
                  'they're beating themselves'
    The middle voice is only possible with non-stative predicates, so predi-
cates like mitto 'to want', tie 'to be present', tammo 'to think', etc. will not
form middles. For non-stative predicates, the distribution of reflexive and
SA senses with the middle is not random, but rather is based on the valence
scheme of the Tr predicate. When the Tr has an inanimate DO, the mid-
dle will take this inanimate argument as Su and have an SA interpretation.
134                         The syntax of simple sentencesWhen the Tr DO is animate, the middle will take this argument as its Su
and have a reflexive interpretation. The generalization here is that if the
Tr Su can be interpreted as the DO also, there will be a reflexive inter-
pretation. But if the Tr Su cannot be interpreted as coreferential with the
DO because the Su is animate and the DO inanimate, there will be an SA
interpretation and the inanimate Tr Su will be the subject of the middle.
Recall that the significance of the middle is that the Su is affected by the
action of the verb. So, the middle of Tr teddö 'to cook' and Tr pyetto 'to
winnow' will have an SA interpretation because their DO is inanimate, but
the middle of TR likko 'to struggle with' and Tr gweppo 'to scratch' will
have a reflexive interpretation:
            (1)   rirjo otedde
                  meat 3s-cook-mid-perf
                  'the meat got cooked'
            (2)   käl opyette
                  millet 3s-winnow-mid-perf
                  'the millet is winnowed'
           (3)    ocaka olikere
                  O. 3s-struggle+with-mid-perf
                  Ochaka struggled with himself
           (4)          ogwepere
                  O. 3s-scratch-mid-perf
                  Opio scratched himself
    The middle is occasionally used in contexts where one might expect
an AN verb. In such cases, the middle seems to be chosen because of the
sense of the subject of the middle as an affected entity. For example, the
Tr verb pwallo 'to give birth to' has an AN counterpart pwäl. The middle
can be seen to contrast with the latter in the following pair:
           (1)    dakö ogiko pwäl                             AN
                  woman 3s-stop-perf give+birth-infin
                  'the woman stopped bearing children'
           (2)    dakö ogiko pwalle                           Middle
                  woman 3s-stop-perf give+birth-mid-infin
                  'the woman stopped bearing children'
(1) simply states the fact, but (2) contributes also the sense of the woman
as being affected, perhaps adversely, by this.","[148, 149, 150]"
"156. Causative constructions like (3) can be shown to be paratactic in the
following way. First, the second clause may be independently negated and
second, may have a different subject from the first clause:
           (1)   loca otnxa pe äwoto
                 man 3s-give-perf-ls neg ls-go-perf
                 the man gave it to me, I didn't go
                 'the man prevented me from going'

8.2.1.1 Introduction In presenting information about a situation that involves several par-
ticipants, many languages make use of devices that allow one to orient
the situation on one or the other of the participants, making it the sub-
ject, and to focus attention on some subset of the participants, eliminat-
ing overt reference to the others. In English, for example, changes in
orientation are frequently accomplished by choice of morphologically un-
related lexical items. In English, the verbs, learn and teach, and please and
like may be used in this way. learn and teach may both encode information
about a situation involving three participants: a source argument (the
teacher), a goal argument (the learner), and a patient argument (the thing
learned or taught). But in encoding this information, they take the point
of view of (or are oriented on) different arguments, learn is oriented on
the goal argument, making it the subject, while teach is oriented on the
124                       The syntax of simple sentencessource argument:
            (1)   Floyd learned Flemish from Florence
            (2)   Florence taught Flemish to Floyd
Similarly please and like both have an experiencer and a patient argument,
but differ in orientation:
            (3)   leeks please Zeke
            (4)   Zeke likes leeks
learn and teach are identical in valence, both having a valence of three,
as are please and like with a valence of two. Further, these pairs of predi-
cates have identical 'valence sets', or arrays of arguments, since they take
the same sorts of arguments (i.e. learn and teach both take source, goal,
and patient arguments), learn and teach, however, are associated with dif-
ferent 'valence schemes', which is to say they differ in the packaging or
presentation of their arguments, choosing different arguments for their
subject orientation, etc.please andlike also have different valence schemes
since please requires an experiencer direct object while like requires an
experiencer subject, buy and sell have a similar relation, having the same
valence sets, but employing different valence schemes. The verb rent
presents a somewhat different situation. With a vale nee set which includes
source, goal, and patient arguments, rent can employ two different
valence schemes:
            (1)   Dudley rented the horse from Nell
            (2)   Nell rented the horse to Dudley
    The verb eat has a valence of two and a valence set which includes an
agent and a patient argument. Like rent, eat can be associated with two dif-
ferent valence schemes — one where the patient is overt, as in
            (1)   Roscoe ate his dinner
and one where overt reference to the patient is not made:
            (2)   Roscoe ate
Notice that not all verbs with transitive valence schemes like eat have in-
transitive counterparts.Jmnc/ί, for example, seems to lack such an intran-
sitive valence scheme:
            (3)   Zeke punched Clyde
            (4)   PZeke punched
With eat, reference to the agent can also be deleted via passive. Passive
can be viewed in this context as a class of valence schemes productively
related to classes of transitive valence schemes. We can refer to such clas-
ses of valence schemes as 'generalized valence schemes', making no judge-
ments about their productivity.
                               Verbal complex                                  1258.2.1.2 Transitive, activity naming, and secondary argument stemsIn Lango, a verb root frequently has two (very rarely three) stems that
represent generalized valence schemes whose characteristics can be sum-
marized as follows:
           1) Transitive (tr): Tr stems refer to an action or state as it
           affects a direct object, which may be definite or non-definite,
           specific or non-specific.
           2) Activity Naming (AN): AN stems express a potentially
           transitive notion, but without any reference to a DO. They
           refer solely to a subject's participation in an activity, but not
           activity directed toward any particular object.
           3) Secondary Argument (SA): SA verbs are defined relative
           to their corresponding transitives. The argument that would
           be the DO of a transitive is the Su of the corresponding SA
           form.85
Any given verb stem in Lango is specified for valence scheme so that a Tr
verb cannot be given an AN use, and vice versa. This, of course, repre-
sents a difference between Lango and English, since Lango has no verbs
like English eat, which can be given either a Tr or AN sense.
     It is very rare for a Lango verb root to have stems representing all
three generalized valence schemes. In fact only one verb root nenp 'see'
(illustrated below (la)) clearly has all three. Many two place predicates
have only a Tr valence scheme; many others contrast a Tr with an AN or
SA. A few examples follow. The infinitive is used as the citation form,
blank spaces indicate that no form exists:               Tr                     AN                        SA

    Lango verb roots are basically of the form CiVC2- In the infinitive,
the transitive is distinctive in having a geminate C2 (if C2 is r, the vowel
is lengthened instead), a final -o, and low tones on root and final
vowels. AN and SA forms do not have a geminate Cg, may or may not
128                        The syntax of simple sentenceshave a final -o, and exhibit a variety of tonal contours. 87
    For any transitive relation expressed verbally, a Tr form exists, so that
there are no ΑΝ/SA pairs without a corresponding Tr.
    Tr and AN forms do not differ simply in the presence or absence of
an expressed DO. In fact, there need not be an overt DO with a Tr verb;
in such cases the Tr will differ in meaning from its corresponding AN:
            (1)    camo dek                 Tr
                  ls-eat-perf stew
                  Ί ate stew'
            (2)   acamo                    Tr
                  ls-eat-perf
                  Ί ate it'
            (3)   acemo                    AN
                  ls-eat-perf
                  Ί ate'
 Notice that the form of the verb does not differ in (1), with a nominal
 DO and (2), with a pronominal DO indicated here by the plain Tr verb.
 Nevertheless, even without an overt DO, (2) still expressed a transitive
 notion, referring to the effect of an action on a DO. (2) would only be
 felicitous if the unexpressed DO were known to the hearer, obvious from
the surroundings, or mentioned previously in discourse. (3), on the other
 hand, refers solely to an activity without reference to its effect on an ob-
ject, and would be felicitous where the act of eating itself was the object
of communication and the logically inferable object was irrelevant to the
discourse.
     SO forms resemble passives in that the DO of the corresponding Tr is
the Su of the SA verb. They are, however, best not viewed as passives for
a variety of reasons. First, as mentioned above, SA forms are not freely
available for all transitive notions, even those that involve activities. For
example, the Tr verbs αέρρό 'to collect, gather', geero 'to build', kwallo
'to steal', and ryetto 'to winnow' do not have SA counterparts (though each
has an AN counterpart). Further, sentences with SA predicates are not
 morphologically or syntactically marked relative to their Tr counterparts;
SA verbs may in fact be considerably simpler, consisting only of the un-
embellished root while Tr verbs always have final -o (except in the sub-
junctive). Compare Tr c gg 'to heal' with SA cag 'to recover':
            (1)   d kt l ocaijo loca                        Tr
                  doctor 3s-heal-perf man
                  'the doctor healed the man'
            (2)   loca ocag                                 SA
                  man 3s-recover-perf
                  'the man recovered'
                                 Verbal complex                           129
Lack of productivity and markedness relationships are important but not
decisive factors in considering SA verbs not to be passives. The most im-
portant factor is simply that SO verbs lack a true passive sense. They are
not necessarily stative, and may have agent Su's. For example, SA »mo
'to yawn' (cf Tr ammo 'to cause to yawn') and SA dok 'to go back' (cf Tr
dwökkö 'to bring back') are active verbs with agent Su's:
            (1)   locaa aarno                          SA
                  man 3s-yawn-prog
                  'the man is yawning'
            (2)   däkö ödäk                            SA
                  woman 3s-go+back-perf
                  'the woman went back'
There is no sense in which (1) or (2) suppose some external agency that
is, for whatever reasons, non-overt. In other words, (2) does not mean 'the
woman was brought back', where there is a clear sense that some non-
overt agency was responsible for the action. A gloss like this would be ex-
pected if dak were the passive counterpart of dwokkd.88
     In sum, any verb root in Lango with a transitive valence scheme may
have, together with its Tr stem form, another stem representing an in-
transitive valence scheme, whose Su corresponds to the Tr Su (AN) or the
transitive DO (SA). The relations between the valence schemes these stems
represent can be schematized as below, the arrows indicating a correspon-
dence between the arguments:
            Tr:         Su         V              DO
            AN:
            SA:8.2.1.3 ProductivityAs indicated above, not all verb roots distinguish a Tr from an intran-
sitive stem. For unpaired verbs, the form follows the function. Unpaired
intransitive verbs in the infinitive take the form CVC or CVCo without
gemination of Cg, thus resembling AN and SA forms: dwogo 'to come
back, return', yaä 'to leave, go away', wot 'to go, walk', binö 'to come'.
Unpaired transitive verbs are morphologically identical to paired tran-
sitives: mitto 'to want', cwallo 'to send', jwatto 'to hit', keddo 'to braid,
scarify'. So, the form of any verb provides no indication of whether the
root is also represented by another valence scheme, but instead con-
forms to the transitivity of the valence scheme itself.
     Easily the majority of Lango verb roots with a valence of two or more
distinguish a Tr valence scheme from an AN or SA valence scheme and
130                       The syntax of simple sentencesthus are represented by more than one stem. The question now arises as
to which roots with transitive valence schemes will have an AN or SA
counterpart. Before proceeding, it is of interest to note that the English
translations of Tr verbs that lack AN counterparts almost always require
either an overt DO or have an SA interpretation when intransitive. For
example, the unpaired Tr verbs noted in the paragraph above all require
overt DO's in English. The verbs want, send, hit (apart from a baseball con-
text), and braid would almost invariably be accompanied by an overt DO,
as opposed to, say, eat or cook, which can frequently be found without one.
In other words, the lack of an AN stem in Lango corresponds to difficul-
ty in detransitivizing in English. Similarly, the presence of a TR/SA op-
position in Lango frequently implies an English counterpart whose
intransitive has an SA interpretation. So the Lango Tr verbs dakko 'to
transfer', gommo 'to bend', kakko 'to split', and wällö 'to boil' all have SA
counterparts. The English translations of these verbs all have SA inter-
pretations when intransitive:
            the man transferred           (they transferred the rnan)
            the metal bent                (they bent the metal)
            the wood split                (the fire split the wood)
            the water boiled              (the boy boiled the water)
In other words, whether semantic/pragmatic factors are in operation in
Lango to produce the various stems, similar factors are also operative in
English regulating the valence schemes available to English verbs.
     Whether any given Tr verb will have an AN, SA, or no intransitive
counterpart depends on its meaning and the details of its valence
scheme. If the Tr has a subject that is necessarily animate and a DO that's
necessarily inanimate, it will have an AN counterpart provided that the
verb describes activities like the following: mundane day-to-day ac-
tivities such as eating, reciting/reading, shaving, sweeping, preparation
of food, physiological functions such as vomiting, or economic activities
such as those relating to the planting, care, and preparation of millet or
other crops, building, or business activities such as trading. In all these
cases, the DO of any of these predicates would be eminently predictable
in the context of traditional Lango society, so its omission would not
result in information loss. The activity itself, not the activity as applied
to a particular object, is what is communicatively significant. So, with a
berb like Tr dinno 'to thresh', the DO could only be kal 'millet' except
under circumstances that would be familiar to everyone with whom one
would have day-to-day contact. Even with predicates like Tr deppo 'to
collect, gather (fruits or vegetables)' whose objects are potentially more
various, the sort of fruit or vegetable that would be collected would be
obvious from the subject, time of year, etc. Both these verbs then have
AN counterparts, dinö and depo. But a verb like mitto 'to want', for ex-
ample, would not have an object predictable out of context and there-
fore has no AN counterparts. So, two factors are relevant for a Tr/AN
                                 Verbal complex                           131pair: animacy considerations and predictability of DO. When the DO is
not predictable and/or is of some interest or is relevant in the context
of a discourse, the Tr is always available.
    A few Tr/AN pairs fall outside the above generalizations. Verbs of emo-
tion, whose English counterparts are all intransitive, form Tr/AN pairs.
Tr kokko 'to cry over', Tr lello 'to rejoice over', Tr peero 'to laugh at' all
have AN counterparts. A few other isolated roots have exceptional Tr/AN
valence schemes: these also have English intransitives as counterparts: Tr
riggo 'to run from' (AN riijo 'to run'), Tr pwallo 'to give birth to', and Tr
leggo 'to pray to'. Also exceptional is Tr ηέηηό 'to see', whose AN nen
has no counterpart in any other sensory verb.89
     In the case of Tr/SA pairs, the Tr typically describes the causation of
physical functions with the SA describing the act itself (e.g. Tr ammo 'to
cause to yawn', SA onto 'to yawn'; Tr jiiro 'to cause to sneeze', SA jir 'to
sneeze'), or the Tr may describe a change of state, with the resulting state
described by the SA (e.g. Tr kweeyo 'to cool', SA kwee 'to be cool'; Tr nfeero
'to wilt', SAner'to wilt'; Tr dogrp 'to grow', SAdwog 'to be big'; Tr mokko
'to make sickly', SA mok 'to be sickly'). The agency with such predicates
is often the elements or an act of nature, difficult to specify and often ir-
relevant in ordinary day-to-day situations. When the agency is relevant,
a Tr verb is used; when it isn't, the SA verb is used.
    For a few Tr/SA pairs, the Tr Su is necessarily animate: Tr's dakko 'to
transfer', dwokko 'to bring back' and kobbo 'to transfer*. For these mo-
tion verbs, the corresponding SO has an obligatorily animate Su which is
also agentive. The Su of the SA corresponds to both Su and DO of the Tr
counterpart. 90 That is, a sentence with SO dok 'to go back',
            (1)   adok                              SA
                  ls-go+back-perf
                  Ί went back'
is more-or-less equivalent to the reflexive middle with Tr dw kk 'to bring
back':
            (2)   adwokere                          Middle
                  ls-bring+back-middle-perf
                  Ί brought myself
    All these pairs have in common that the DO of the Tr is not
stereotyped or predictable, unlike the Tr DO of Tr/AN pairs. When an
SA verb is used, the logically inferrable agency is communicatively ir-
relevant or, in the case of motion verbs, can be inferred to be the same
as the SA Su. Verbs like jwatto 'to hit', cwallo 'to send', etc. don't have
AN or SA counterparts because neither the Su nor the DO is stereotyped
or irrelevant in ordinary communicative situations. Tr/AN and Tr/SA
pairs are not present idiosyncratically in the lexicon, but rather are, in
general predictable on the basis of the semantic/pragmatic considera-
tions mentioned above. This is true despite the fact that the form of the
132                        The syntax of simple sentencesintransitive is (synchronically) unpredictable and each stem must be
separately lexicalized.
     The similarity in form noted above of AN and SO verbs is never like-
ly to be communicatively disfunctional, i.e. they are not likely to be con-
fused, because the pragmatics of each verb would determine conclusively
which it had to be.","[139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148]"

9.1.5 Reduced clauses: infinitives and gerunds
Infinitives in Lango occur in certain contexts where the logical subject of
the embedded clause is identical to the subject of the matrix clause in com-
plement constructions (Sec 9.3),
            ( 1 ) amxtto gweey odilo
                 ls-want-prog kick-infin ball
                   want to kick the ball'
            (2) ädäg kwänno bukki
                 ls-refuse-hab read-infin book-this
                   refuse to read this book'
and as nominalizations:
            (1) äpwop otitowa ä cecek beer a kwän
                teacher 3s-tell-perf-lp att+part little+bit good-infin
                   att+part read-infin
                'the teacher told us briefly about the benefits of reading'
            (2) dako kwannere her
                woman read-infin-3sa 3sa-good-hab
                'the woman's reading is good'
            (3) matto tabä räc
                drink-infin tobacco 3s-bad-hab
                'smoking tobacco is bad'
     The object of an infinitive is expressed as for verbs — objects do not
form associative relationships with their infinitives. Infinitives take ordi-
nary object inflections, may occur in the middle voice, and have benefac-
tive and ventive forms. In nominalizations only, the subject of the
infinitive can occur as an associative NP with the infinitive as head. This
is illustrated in (1) and by the complex associative (Sec. 8.7.3) in (2).
Human subjects almost always occur in complex associatives when
definite. When both a direct object and a subject are present, the subject
forms an associative relationship with the syntactic unit consisting of the
infinitive and its direct object:
214                      The syntax of complex sentences           (4) nekko gwökk ä dako rac
               kill-infm dog att+part woman 3s-bad-hab
               'the killing of a dog by a woman is bad'
           (5) dako nekko gwok'kere räc
               woman kill-infin dog-3sa 3s-bad-hab
               'the woman's killing of the dog is bad'
In both (4) and (5), dako 'woman' could be interpreted as having an as-
sociative relationship with gwök 'dog', so that (5) could be interpreted as
meaning 'the killing of the woman's dog is bad'. Infinitives themselves
may occur in any sort of noun slot: They may be subjects, direct objects,
associatives (as in (1) above), and objects of prepositions:
           (6) atie kän me cem
               ls-be+present-hab here for eat-infin
               'I'm here to eat'
     Phenomena that could be interpreted as raising appear to be restricted
to the 'tough-movement' (object to subject) type and do not involve infini-
tives. This will be discussed below.
    Gerunds, which occur also in reduplicative constructions (Sec. 8.10),
are found in two other contexts. First, they are found in purpose construc-
tions (Sec. 9.12.4) with the preposition me 'for, in order to' when the no-
tional object of the verb rendered as a gerund is the head of the
construction:
           (1) kälmeäregä
               millet for grind-ger
               'millet for grinding'
           (2) man buk me akwänä
               this book for read-ger
               'this is a book for reading'
           (3) ämäko gweno me äcämänä
               ls-catch-perf chicken for eat-ger-lsa
                 caught a chicken for me to eat'
Notice that the notional subject of the gerund in the last example is
rendered as an associative pronoun affix, attesting to the nominal status
of gerunds, at least in this construction. This interpretation of gerunds
is further attested by the fact that gerunds can be object of preposition
(e.g. me).
    Gerunds are also used in what appears to be the only instance of some-
thing that could be analyzed as raising in the language:
           (1) cämmo gweno ber
               eat-infin chicken 3s-good-hab
               'eating chicken is good'
                                           Relative clauses                215            / f\\      v   *   ·   v   '   A
            (2) gweno her acama
                chicken 3s-good-hab eat-ger
                'chicken is good to eat'
b«r 'good' is the only predicate that clearly allows this construction. Here,
as in purpose constructions, gerunds are used when the nominalized predi-
cate is separated from its object.","[229, 230, 231]"
"
9.1.3 ParataxisParataxis, technically asyndetic parataxis, is very frequently encountered
in Lango.     It involves the juxtaposition of two clauses forming a single
sentence without any marker of subordination or coordination specifying
the relation between the two clauses. Some examples:
                     complementation
           (1) dako odio ic5 opyeto kal
                     woman 3s-pressed-perf man 3s-winnow-perf millet
                     the woman pressed the man, he winnowed millet

    In the following sections, I will discuss the morphological, syntactic,
and semantic characteristics of parataxis in Lango. I will try to relate the
distribution of paratactic constructions to the general meaning of
parataxis in the language. 1
9.1.3.1 General characteristics of paratactic constructions
In this section, I will discuss some general characteristics of paratactic con-
structions. In particular, I will show that paratactic constructions are single
sentences consisting of two (or more) syntactically independent though
parallel clauses forming a single phonological unit. The second clause can-
not have an overt nominal subject and no marker of subordination or coor-
dination links the two clauses.
    The phonological status of paratactic constructions as single sentences
is shown first of all by the fact that paratactic constructions form intona-
tional units like simple sentences and not like compound sentences. In the
196                        The syntax of complex sentencescase of true conjoined sentences, for instance those conjoined with
'but, as for', there is a pause before the conjunction and each conjunct ex-
hibits a left-to-right falling intonation contour (cf Sec. 9.1.2). Paratactic
constructions, like simple sentences, exhibit a single left-to-right falling in-
tonation contour with no characteristic pause at the clause boundary. In
this way, paratactic constructions differ from other sorts of juxtaposed
clauses in Lango and other languages, where the intonation pattern reveals
a division into two clauses. The English juxtapsed construction,
            (1) it's not cheap, it's expensive
exhibits this pattern while
            (2) go tell your brother to come in
is the English counterpart of the Lango paratactic construction. Downdrift,
as well as downstep, phenomena in Lango operate in the normal way across
clause boundaries in paratactic constructions. For example, the word däkö
'woman' conditions downstep on any high tone following it, as in:
            (1)   dako kedo akeddi -^ [däxo_^kedo äked'i]
                  woman 3s-braid-hab grass
                  'the woman braids grass'
dakö also conditions downstep across clause boundaries in parataxis:
            (2)   ätin önwörjö dxö däkö tedde dek —>
                     [ätin önwörjö dio däxo_^t£d«e dek]
                  child 3s-find-perf 3s-press-hab woman 3s-cook-ben-hab
                     3s-stew
                  the child used to press the woman, she used to cook
                     for him
                  'the child used to force the woman to cook for him'
     In true coordinate constructions, the conjunction begins a new in-
tonation contour and can not register downstep. Similarly, other rules of
external sandhi such as those converting /k/ to [x] and /t/ to [ ] (a voice-
less tap) operate across clause boundaries in parataxis, so that the word
final /k/ in gwök 'dog' in
            (3)   äwipo gwök ogweo
                  ls-hear-perf dog 3s-bark-perf
                  I heard the dog, it barked
                    heard the dog bark'
is pronounced [x], whereas in sentence final position, even when followed
by a conjunction, as in
            (4) awijio gwök, ento pe aneno
                ls-hear-perf dog, but neg ls-see-perf
                  heard the dog, but I didn't see it'
                                  Introduction                              197it is pronounced as a velar stop.
     Each clause in the paratactic construction contains a fully inflected
verb so that each clause could stand by itself as an independent sentence,
as indicated by the glosses provided for paratactic constructions. The
verbs need not agree in aspect. 8 Each clause may be independently
 negated.    Only the first verb in the series can have an overt nominal
or pronominal subject; any verbs following the first are inflected for sub-
ject agreement but have as their subject some referent that is either sub-
ject or object of the first clause in the series. In the case of sentences like
            (1) loca odio atin okwano buk
                  man 3s-press-perf child 3s-read-perf book
                  the man pressed the child, he read the book
                  'the man forced the child to read the book'
the noun atin 'child' is notionally the direct object of the first verb odio
'pressed' and the subject of the second verb okwano 'read', but syntactical-
ly, it functions only as the object of odio. There is one simple demonstra-
tion of the syntactic status of atin in (1). When atin is pronominalized, the
verb odio is inflected for third singular object, as in (2):
            (2) loc» odie okwano buk
                  man 3s-press-perf-3s 3s-read-perf book
                  the man pressed him, he read the book
                  'the man forced him to read the book'
Pronominalized direct objects in Lango appear as object affixes as in (2)
(Sec. 8.2.5), but pronominalized subjects can either be non-overt, appear-
ing only as inflections on the verb or can appear as a subject pronoun ac-
companied by the subject agreement inflection. If atin in (1) is
pronominalized by either of the techniques available for subjects, the
result is ungrammatical:
            (3) *loc» odio okwano buk
                  man 3s-press-perf 3s-read-perf book
                  'the man forced him to read the book ""            (4)   *loc» odio en okwano buk
                  man 3s-press-perf he 3s-read-perf book
                  'the man forced him to read the book'            (5) *loca die en okwano buk
                  man 3s-press-perf-3s he 3s-read-perf book
                  'the man forced him to read the book'It might be maintained, however, that (2) is simply some sort of phonological
reduction of (4). There are good semantic reasons why this could not be the
case given the respective functions of έη and the paratactic construction, as
198                         The syntax of complex sentenceswill become evident in what follows, but an additional problem with this
analysis involves the tone on the second verb. When a third person singular
perfective verb in Lango has an overt pronomial subject, as in
             (6) en okwano buk
                 he 3s-read-perf book
                 'he read the book'
the verb assumes the relative clause tonal pattern (Sec. 8.2.5, 9.2) of low-
high-low, the same as we find in the relative construction in
             (7) Ioc9 okwano buk
                 man 3s-read-perf book
                 'the man who read the book'
When the verb has no overt subject or when the subject is a noun, the tonal
pattern in the perfective is low-low-low, as in
             (8)   okwano buk
                   3s-read-perf book
                   'he read the book'
             (9) loca okwano buk
                 man 3s-read-perf book
                 'the man read the book'
This tone alternation is a grammatically conditioned feature, and is not a
 matter of tone sandhi. If (2) did in fact arise through phonological reduc-
tion of some construction like (4), where en was the subject of okwano,
then we would expect the second verb in (2) to have the relative tone. This
relative tone can occur in subordinate clauses when the pronoun       is sub-
ject, as in
             (10) ätämö ni en omato korp
                  ls-think-perf comp he 3s-drink-perf beer
                    thought that he drank beer'
We do not find relative tone on okwano in (2), even as an option. Note
also that when the subject of the first verb in
            ( 1 ) loca odio ätin okwano buk
                  man 3s-press-perf child 3s-read-perf book
                  the man pressed the child, he read the book
                  'the man forced the child to read the book'
is relativized, as in
            (2) loca ame odio ätin okwano buk
                man rel + part 3s-press-perf child 3s-read-perf book
                'the man that forced the child to read the book'
the relative tone appears on the first verb. But if ätin 'child' is relativized
                                     Introduction                         199on, the relative tone does not appear on the second verb:
            (3) ätinn äme l ocä ödio okwano buk
                child rel-i-part man 3s-press-perf 3s-read-perf book
                'the child that the man forced to read the book'
But the relative tone may appear in subordinate clauses:
            (4)   ätinn äme loca ötamo ni okwano buk
                  child rel+part man 3s-think-perf comp 3s-read-perf book
                  'the child that the man thought read the book'
This, then, constitutes additional proof that ätin in (1) is not the gram-
matical subject of the second verb in the series.
    Another indication of the syntactic status of paratactic constructions
comes from a comparison of paratactic complements with hypotactic com-
plements. A hypotactic complement is a subordinate clause, whereas a
paratactic complement is not. With hypotactic complements, both indica-
tive and subjunctive, a verb inflected for third person must have a prefix
indicating whether the subject of the subordinate clause is the same or dif-
ferent from the subject of the main clause. In the third person singular per-
fective, the prefix indicating same subject (non-switch reference) is -, and
the prefix indicating different subject (switch reference) is o-. These forms
are illustrated below:
                  non-switch reference
            (1) rwot opoyo ni ecego dogola
                king 3s-remember-perf comp 3s-close-perf door
                'the kingi remembered that hei closed the door'
                  switch reference
            (2) rwot opoyo ni ocego dagola
                'the kingi remembered that he/shej closed the door'
                                         i*j
In (1), the subject of ecegö must be interpreted as rwot 'king', while in (2)
the subject ofocegö must be interpreted as being someone other than the
king. This is available only in subordinate clauses. Since the switch
reference prefix o- is the same as the orcinary main clause third person
singular perfective prefix o-, (3) is a possible sentence,
            (3) ocegö dogalä
                3s-close-perf door
                'he/she closed the door'
whereas (4) is not:
            (4)   *ecego dogalä
   The non-switch reference prefix e- is possible only in hypotactic sub-
ordinate clauses, and is not available in adjacent sentences in discourse or
200                        The syntax of complex sentencesin paratactic constructions. So, the paratactic construction             (5) rwot öpöyö ocegö dogola
                   king 3s-remember-perf 3s-close-perf door
                   the king remembered it, he closed the door
                   'the king remembered to close the door'
does not have a counterpart in
             (6)   *rwot öpoyö ecegö dogolä
even though the subjects of both verbs in (5) are taken to be coreferen-
tial, which in the case of a true hypotactic complement clause would re-
quire the non-switch reference prefix e-, as in (1).
     We can sum up the characteristic features of paratactic constructions
discussed so far as follows:
             1. the two clauses form a phonological unit like simple
                sentences and unlike conjoined clauses
             2. each clause contains a fully inflected verb
             3. the verbs need not agree in aspect; auxiliaries may occur
                 on either clause
             4. each verb may be independently negated
             5. only the first verb in the series has an overt subject NP
             6. hypotactic switch reference morphology is not available
                to the second clause
             7. no overt marker of coordination or subordination links
                the clauses
             8. the subject of the second clause must be an argument of
                the first
9.1.3.2 Semantics of parataxis
 Having considered some aspects of the syntax of parataxis, it remains now to
 consider its semantic aspects and to try to relate the syntax to the semantics.
     The twelve sentences given in the introduction to this section are a
 representative sample of the sort of semantic relations that can be coded
 with the paratactic construction in Lango. It might seem on first inspec-
 tion, given the diversity of the sample, that any sort of relation between
 two propositions can be coded paratactically. This is, in fact, not the case.
The relationships that can be expressed by means of parataxis include
only those that are compatable with a separate assertion of each of the
juxtaposed clauses, where, moreover, both clauses must be taken as true,
a situation that resembles that of ordinary conjunction with 'and'. The
exact nature of the relationship between the two clauses in inferred from
the set of relationships compatable with the meaning of the construction
                                  Introduction                           201on the basis of real world knowledge. In this way, more than one inter-
pretation of a paratactic construction is often possible. For instance,
             (1)    ryek pe m to koip
                   ls-wise-hab neg ls-drink-hab beer
                   'I'm wise, I don't drink beer'
can be interpreted as either
             (2) I'm wise because I don't drink beer
or
             (3) I'm wise therefore I don't drink beer
In cases of real ambiguity, a more exact meaning can be specified by resort-
ing to a non-paratactic construction, so that the meaning of (2) can be
rendered by
             (4)    ryek pi έη pe m to
                   ls-wise-hab because+of it neg ls-drink-hab beer
                   I'm wise because I don't drink beer
    The characterization of the semantics of parataxis given above makes
certain predictions about non-occurring interpretations of paratactic con-
structions. A few of these will be mentioned here:(i) Because each of the clauses is asserted to be true, paratactic construc-
tions cannot receive a conditional interpretation. Therefore the sentence
             ( 1 ) όηέηέ omiye buk
                   3s-saw-perf-3s 3s-give-perf-3s book
                   he saw him, he gave him the book
can be interpreted as
             (2) he saw him give him the book
or
             (3) when he saw him, he gave him the book
but not as
             (4) *if he saw him, he gave him the book
The reason, of course, is that in the conditional interpretation neither
clause is asserted to be true.(ii) Similarly, paratactic constructions cannot be interpreted disjunctive-
ly, because this interpretation would require that one of the clauses be in-
terpreted as not true. For instance, the paratactic construction
202                       The syntax of complex sentences            (1) däko otedö riijo omyeno kwan
                woman 3s-cook-perf meat 3s-cook-perf millet+meal
                the woman cooked meat, she cooked millet meal
can mean any of the following:
            (2) the woman cooked meat and millet meal
            (3) the woman cooked meat because she cooked millet meal
            (4) the woman cooked meat therefore she cooked millet meal
but cannot be interpreted disjunctively:
            (5) *the woman cooked meat or millet meal(iii) A paratactic construction consists of a pair of assertions united within
a single sentence, and in this way resembles clauses conjoined by 'and' in
English. Such clauses are normally arranged in a linear order that accords
with their order in real time, so that
            (1) Zeke got sick and he died
is acceptable, but
            (2) *Zeke died and he got sick
is not. Conjoined clauses may also describe simultaneous actions as in:
            (3) he ate and he drank
A similar situation holds in parataxis. Where the two clauses represent
events, their order will correspond to real time order or be interpreted as
being roughly simultaneous. In this way,
            (4) an ädSk paco pe anworjo ginnoro
                I ls-go+back-perf home neg ls-find-perf thing-indef
                I went back home, I didn't find anything
                'after I went back home, I didn't find anything'
can't be interpreted as
            (5) when I didn't find anything, I went back home
since that would require that the event coded by the second clause be in-
terpreted as occurring before that of the first clause.(iv) As complements, the second, complement-like clause of a paratactic
construction may only occur where the semantic relation between the
clauses is compatable with the two-assertion aspect of parataxis. The
paratactic complement is a member of a system of oppositions that in-
cludes a hypotactic indicative, a subjunctive, and an infinitive (see Sec. 9.3
and Noonan and Bavin 1978a for more detailed discussion of this). The
                                 Introduction                              203indicative is used with complements with independent time reference, the
subjunctive and infinitive with clauses with determined time reference,
the infinitive being further specified for equi-subject conditions; it is not
marked for subject agreement. The paratactic complement only occurs in
semantic environments where both the clause containing the complement
taking predicate and the complement clause itself can be interpreted as
separate assertions. This contrasts with the situation in hypotaxis, which
affects all the other complement-types in Lango, where there is a single
assertion involving both the complement taking predicate and the com-
plement, allowing the complement taking predicate to act as a sort of
semantic filter qualifying the interpretaion of the complement.
     The system of oppositions in complementation involving the paratac-
tic construction will be illustrated briefly. First, the paratactic complement
and the hypotactic indicative complement:

                child 3s-see-perf man 3s-blunt-perf knife
                the child saw the man, he blunted the knife

                the girl remembered it, she threshed the millet
                'the girl remembered to thresh the millet'
                hypotactic indicative complement

                ls-neg ls-believe-hab comp O. 3s-eat-perf fish
                  don't believe that Okelo ate the fish'
The paratactic and hypotactic indicative complements share indicative
verb morphology, differentiating both from subjunctive and infinitive
complements. As mentioned above, (hypotactic) indicative complements
are used where the complement has independent time reference vis-ä-vis
the matrix clause, and where the entire sentence constitutes a single asser-
tion. (5) provides an illustration of a case where the time reference of the
204                       The syntax of complex sentencescomplement taking predicate and the complement differ. (3-6) also con-
stitute single assertions; the interpretation of the complement predication
as true or false follows from the meaning of the complement taking predi-
cate, so that the complements in (3-4) are interpreted as true, while those
in (5-6) are interpreted as false. That is, the logical status of the comple-
ment is provided by the matrix predicate. In parataxis, there are limita-
tions in time reference possibilities (cf (iii) above) and both clauses must
constitute assertions regardless of the meaning of the first predicate. The
logical status of the second clause is not in any way qualified by the first.
If poy- 'remember' is negated in (2), the meaning is not the negation of
the English gloss, 'the girl didn't remember to thresh millet', since the
only interpretation possible with this gloss is that the girl didn't thresh
the millet. In parataxis each clause is a separate assertion, so negating the
first clause cannot affect the truth value of the second. In fact, the nega-
tion of the first clause in (2)
            (2) °jiäkö pe opoyo ödinö kal
                girl neg 3s-remember-perf 3s-thresh-perf millet
                the girl didn't remember is, she threshed millet
results in a semantically anomalous sentence because it makes no sense
to assert that the girl didn't remember something but then did it anyway.
(Note: Anomalous sentences are marked with < 0 > .) Notice that the nega-
tion of (4)
            (4) jiako pe opoyo ni edino käl
                'the girl didn't remember that she threshed millet'
is not semantically anomalous.
    Both subjunctive and infinitive complements have determined time
reference, which is to say that the time reference of such complements fol-
lows from the meaning of the matrix predicate. For example, in
           (1) ämittö läkko tic
               ls-want-prog change-infin work
                 want to change jobs'
           (2) amitto ni olSk tic
               ls-want-prog comp 3s-change-subj work
                 want him to change jobs'
both in the infinitive complement in (1) and the subjunctive in (2), the
time reference of the complement must be future relative to the matrix.
The infinitive only occurs where its implied subject is the same as the
matrix subject. Neither subjunctive nor infinitive is marked morphologi-
cally for tense or aspect (Sec. 8.2.4).
    The subjunctive contrasts with the paratactic complement with a few
predicates. For example, with di- 'press',
                                  Introduction                             205            (3) rwot odxa ni akvp bur
                 king 3s-press-perf-ls comp ls-dig-subj hole
                 'the king pressed me to dig a hole'
            (4) rwot odxa äkupä bikr
                 king 3s-press-perf-ls ls-dig-perf hole
                 the king pressed me, I dug a hole
                 'the king forced me to dig a hole'
the subjunctive (3) receives a 'non-realized' interpretation (Sec. 9.3.1),
hence the gloss with 'press', while the paratactic complement (4) has a
'realized' interpretation, so 'force' is used in the gloss. The realized inter-
pretation in (4) results, of course, from the fact that the second clause is
separately asserted.
    In sum the difference between hypotaxis and parataxis can be
diagrammed as in (1):
            (1) hypotaxis
                 (complement taking predicate (complement))
                              ASSERTION
                parataxis
                 (complement taking predicate) (complement)
                        ASSERTION              ASSERTION
    Those matrix-complement relations whose interpretation is not com-
patable with an assertion of both clauses do not occur with paratactic com-
plements. For example, complements do desiderative predicates like
mitto 'want' are not coded paratactically since the second clause cannot
be taken to be a realized event. The same holds for gennö 'hope, trust'.
Utterance predicates like kobbo 'say' also do not take paratactic comple-
ments since the use of these predicates does not imply the truth of the
complement, as in
            (2) Roscoe said that the Earth is flat
Such complements, except when the matrix verb is present and the sub-
ject of the matrix is first person singular, are reports of assertions, not
assertions themselves. Complements to commentative predicates (fac-
tives) are similarly not assertions, though they are taken to be true. Their
status as discourse backgrounded material is incompatable with the func-
tion of the paratactic construction to display two connected assertions.
Further, modal predicates like tweero 'to be able' and myeero 'to be
necessary' cannot occur as complement taking predicates with paratactic
complements because, like desideratives, their complements do not rep-
resent realized events and cannot in themselves constitute assertions.
    Paratactic complements do occur in the following environments, all of
which are compatable with an interpretation of each clause as an assertion:
206                        The syntax of complex sentences(a) as complements to immediate perception predicates.
In the sentence
            (1) aneno loca omako gweno
                ls-see-perf man 3s-catch-perf chicken
                I saw the man, he caught the chicken
                Ί saw the man catch the chicken'
both the first clause
            (2) aneno loca
                  Ί saw the man'
and the second clause
            (3) omako gweno
                  'he caught the chicken'
can be uttered as separate assertions without damage to the immediate
perception sense of the whole since both the act of perception and the
thing perceived must be real events in order for the sentence as a whole
to be true. Notice also that when the first clause in (1) is negated, the result
is not like the negation of its English translation:
            (4)   pe aneno loca omako gweno
                  neg ls-see-perf man 3s-catch-perf chicken
                  I didn't see the man, he caught the chicken
(4) could mean something like Ί didn't see the man therefore he caught
the chicken', but it can't mean Ί didn't see the man catch the chicken', at
least with the more usual (or unmarked) set of presuppositions. (5),
however, could provide one translation, depending again on what is in-
terpreted to be under the scope of negation:            (5)   aneno loca pe omako gweno
                  ls-see-perf man neg 3s-catch-perf chicken
                  I saw the man, he didn't catch the chicken
                  Ί didn't see the man catch the chicken'
Notice that in (5) the first clause is not under the scope of the negative
particle pe, so the sentence asserts that I saw the man, but denies that he
caught the chicken.(b) as complements to positive propositional attitude predicates when used
assertively.
Positive propositional attitude predicates, especially with a first person sin-
gular subject and the verb in the habitual aspect, can be used both to make
an assertion about the speaker's belief and to make an assertion about the
content of the complement clause. In Lango, this difference is made
                                 Introduction                             207manifest in the use of the hypotactic indicative complement when making
an assertion about speaker belief and the paratactic complement when as-
serting the content of the complement proposition. So the sentence
            (1) ätämo ni rwotwä räc
                ls-believe-hab comp king-1 pa 3s-bad-hab
                  believe that our king is bad'
using the hypotactic indicative with its complementizer ni, involves
making an assertion about belief. The corresponding paratactic construc-
tion, however, asserts that I believe something, but at the same time as-
serts the content of the complement proposition:
            (2) ätämö rwotwä räc
                ls-think-hab king-1 pa 3s-bad-hab
                I think of our king, he is bad
                   believe our king is bad'
The difference between the two constructions is brought to sharp relief
when they are negated. The hypotactic construction (1) can be negated
with no contradiction,
            (3) pe ätämö ni rwotwä räc
                neg ls-thing-hab comp king-lpa 3s-bad-hab
                  don't believe that our king is bad'
since it is belief that is being asserted. In the case of the paratactic con-
struction, where both belief and the badness of the king is being asserted,
its negation
            (4) ° pe ätämö rwötwä räc
                neg ls-think-hab king-lpa 3s-bad-hab
                I don't think of the king, he is bad
produces an unacceptable sentence since it is anomalous to assert that you
have no thoughts about the king and then assert that the king is bad. Sen-
tences with prepositional attitude predicates containing paratactic com-
plements have a great deal in common with sentences in other languages
containing parenthetical uses of these predicates (Noonan 1985).(c) as complements to positive achievement predicates (implicatives).
Achievement predicates like pooyo 'to remember' also take paratactic
complements as in
           (1) loca opoyo olwero modo
               man 3s-remember-perf 3s-clear-perf compound
               the man remembered it, he cleared the compound
               'the man remembered to clear the compound'
since an interpretation of the whole is compatable with the assertion of
208                      The syntax of complex sentencesthe two component clauses. Here again, negation of the first clause
produces an anomalous sentence,
           (2) ° pe loc» opoyo olwero moda
               neg man 3s-remember-perf 3s-clear-perf compound
               the man didn't remember it, he cleared the compound
since it makes no sense to assert that the man forgot something and then
to assert that he subsequently did it.(d) as complements to causative predicates.
When paratactic constructions occur as complements to causative predi-
cates, the complements are always implied to be realized events, as in
           ( 1 ) däkö odiö atin öjäbo käl
                woman 3s-press-perf child 3s-scoop-perf millet
                the woman pressed the child, she scooped up millet
                'the woman forced the child to scoop up millet'
since both clauses are individually asserted. When the complement is not
taken to be a realized event, another complement-type, the subjunctive,
must be used:
           (2) dakö odio atin nz ojäb käl
               woman 3s-press-perf child comp 3s-scoop-subj millet
               'the woman pressed the child to scoop up millet'(e) as complements to phasal predicates.
Phasal predicates like cäkkö 'to begin' take paratactic complements be-
cause they too are compatable with an interpretation where each clause
is an assertion:
           (1) jiako ocako otedo dek
                girl 3s-begin-perf 3s-cook-perf stew
                the girl began it, she cooked the stew
                'the girl began to cook the stew'Notice, however, that the paratactic construction cannot occur as comple-
ments to tyekko 'to finish, cease' because a sentence like           (2) päkö otyeko 6k5p5 tottere
               girl 3s-finish-perf 3s-help-perf mother-3sa
               the girl finished it, she helped her mothercannot mean 'the girl finished helping her mother' since (2) asserts that
the girl helped her mother and the sequence implied in (2) requires that
the helping follow the finishing. (2) can only mean something like 'when
                                  Introduction                              209the girl finished it, she helped her mother'. Complements to tyekko are
coded in the infinitive:
            (3) päkö otyekö koppo tottere
                girl 3s-finish-perf help-infin mother-3sa
                'the girl finished helping her mother'
    One further characteristic of paratactic constructions should be noted.
Sentences that consist of paratactically linked clauses can only be em-
bedded as relative clauses (some examples were given above) and as com-
plements to factive predicates where they clearly constitute backgrounded,
not asserted material, and where they constitute reports of assertions, as
in complements to utterance predicates like kobbo 'to say'. Elsewhere,
they are quite unnatural when embedded and it is difficult to assess their
grammaticality. "" This issue is touched on again in Sec. 9.1.4 and 11.2.
    In the course of this section, I have referred on a couple of occasions
to the similarity of the paratactic construction to clauses conjoined with
'and' in English. I mentioned, for example, that in both constructions
certain temporal relations between the clauses are normally observed.
A further similarity lies in the sort of logical relations that may be in-
ferred to hold between the clauses. For example, the relation of cause
and consequence can be found in parataxis and in clauses conjoined
with 'and', as in (1):
            (1) she took arsenic and (in consequence) fell ill
As Dik (1968) points out, the semantic value of 'and' as a conjoiner of
 clauses is only that the clauses 'should be taken as combined in some way'
 (p. 266). The exact nature of the relation between the clauses is left to in-
 ference, which, as I have indicated above, is the same for clauses in
 parataxis.
     Lango has no word that functions like English 'and' (Sections 8.7.5
and 9.1.2). The 'and' relation in Lango can be served by parataxis, which
 like 'and' in English, functions only to indicate that clauses are to be taken
 as combined, without indicating anything further about their semantic
 relationship. Note, however, that not all clauses conjoinable with 'and' in
 English can be linked paratactically in Lango. For example, in parataxis
 the subject of the second clause must be an argument of the first. This con-
straint, which amounts to a 'topic-link' requirement, greatly limits the
range of parataxis vis-ä-vis 'and'. Conversely, parataxis in Lango is wide-
ly used in situations where English would specify the semantic relation.
     It is important to stress, however, that parataxis in Lango is distinct
 from coordination. For instance, Ross' Coordinate Structure Constraint,
which applies to true coordinate structures in Lango, does not apply to
paratactic constructions (Sections 9.2 and 9.9.1).
     In sum, the semantic force of parataxis in Lango is the asyndetic con-
junction of two topic-linked assertions. The semantic relation between the
clauses is inferred from real world knowledge, allowing for a variety of
210                        The syntax of complex sentencesinterpretations all of which must be consistent with the two assertion
aspects of the construction.
    The grammatical status of parataxis will be discussed further in Sec.
11.2.","[210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226]"
"
8.3 Predicate nominal and predicate adjective constructionsPredicate nominal constructions normally consist of the subject followed
by the predicate nominal without a copula. The predicate nominal is in-
flected for subject agreement, taking, as one would expect on semantic
grounds, habitual aspect inflections:
           (1)   an ädäktäl
                 I ls-doctor-hab
                 'I'm a doctor'
           (2)   yin idäktäl
                 you 2s-doctor-hab
                 'you're a doctor'
           (3)     däktäl
                 he 3s-doctor-hab
                 'he's a doctor'
In response to a question such as
                    Predicate nominal and adjective constructions        145           (4)   danö ijä?
                 person who
                 'who's that?'
the response could be either
           (5)   en okelo
                 heO.
                 'it's Okelo'
or
           (6)   okelo do
                 O. part
                 'it's Okelo'
do is an affirmative particle indicating friendly assurance.
    When a past time reference is indicated, the construction can be left
as in (1) through (3), with context or a time adverbial sufficing, be made
past with onwOQO, or, most likely, have bedo 'to sit, stay' conjugated in
the perfective functioning as a copula. In the latter case, the predicate
nominal no longer functions as syntactic predicate and therefore is not
inflected for subject agreement:
           (1)   an abedo daktal
                 I ls-stay-perf doctor
                   was a doctor'
When a future time reference is indicated, bedo is also used, this time with
the binö periphrastic future:
           (2)   okelo binö bedo rwot
                 O. 3s-come-hab stay-infin king
                 Okelo will be king'
When predicate nominale occur in contexts that syntactically require in-
finitives, bedo is obligatory:
           (3)   amttto bedo rwot
                 ls-want-prog stay-infin king
                   want to be king'
    In identification sentences, the third person singular independent
pronoun en is frequently interposed between the subject and the predi-
cate nominal when the predicate nominal has a definite interpretation:
           (1)   man en gwökk ä däkö ökwalö
                 this it dog att+part woman 3s-steal-perf
                 'this is the dog that the woman stole'
When the predicate nominal has an indefinite or generic interpretation,
en cannot be used:
146                         The syntax of simple sentences             (2)   man gwök
                   this 3s-dog-hab
                   'this is a dog'
    can be inserted even when the subject is not third person singular
(cf. Hebrew (Berman and Grosu 1976) and Wappo (Li and Thompson
1977)):
             (3)   an en adäktäl
                   I he ls-doctor-hab
                     am the doctor'
      Predicate nominals can be modified in the usual way (Sec. 9.2):
             (1)   an adäktäl ber
                   I ls-doctor-hab rel + part 3s-good-hab
                     am a good doctor'
             (2)      rwöttä
                   he 3s-king-hab-lsa
                   'he is my king'
    Predicate adjectives, like predicate nominals, are inflected in the
habitual aspect, and do not require a copula when given a present time
significance:
             (1)   an äräc
                   I ls-bad-hab
                      am bad'
             (2)   äjärjä rac
                   cat 3s-bad-hab
                   'the cat is bad'
As with predicates nominals, onworjo or bedo can be used to indicate past
time reference (bedo being the most frequent):
             (1)   an onworjo äräc
                   I 3s-find-perf ls-bad-hab
                     was bad'
             (2)   an abedo rac
                   1 ls-stay-perf bad
                     was bad'
bedo is used in future contexts (with the bino periphrastic future) and in
contexts requiring an infinitive:
             (1)   an äbinö bedo räc
                   I ls-come-hab stay-infin bad
                     will be bad'
                           Predicate nominal and adjective constructions   147            (2)      an amxtto bedo rac
                     I ls-want-prog stay-infin bad
                       want to be bad'
Notice that the adjective does not agree with the matrix subject (Sec. 5.4.1).
Predicate adjectives may also occur with doko 'to become':
            (1)      äläbä odoko dwdij
                     A. 3s-become-perf fat
                     'Alaba became fat'
    One quirk of adjectives, both predicate and attributive, is that they
sometimes require stem (synchronically idiosyncratic) changes when as-
sociated with a plural subject (or plural head):

                     I ls-bad-hab
                     'I'm bad'
            / f\ \     S     ^   S   *.            (2)      wan oracu

See Sec. 5.4.2 for a discussion of these forms. No verb (or predicate
nominal) exhibits changes of this sort.

ContrastContrast may be indicated by intonation alone, but this device is statisti-
cally less frequently employed in Lango than in English, clefting being
the preferred device. Generally speaking, contrast by intonation is used
for the purpose of maintaining parallel structure. For example, if A says
           (1) rwot όηέηό okelo i poto
               king 3s-see-perf O. in garden
               'the king saw Okelo in the garden'
and Β believes that Ojuk, not Okello, was seen by the king, Β might retort
           (2) rwot όηέηό ojxrk i poto
               king 3s-see-perf O. in garden
               'the king saw Ojuk in the garden'
252                             Structures in discoursemaintaining the original sentence structure. (The underlined word is
given contrastive stress). However, the most likely response is (3), utiliz-
ing a cleft construction:
            (3) ojxrk έη me rw t όηέηέ i p to
                O. it rel+part king 3s-see-perf-3s in garden
                'it's Ojuk that the king saw in the garden'
Any NP may be contrastively stressed or clefted.
    When an object pronoun is in contrast an additional possibility, the
reinforced object construction, presents itself. Here the appropriate
pronoun follows the inflected verb:
                  Χ     1   ν
            έ Λ\  1^Ί_>**
            (4)  alaba   οηεηε* *εη
                 A. 3s-see-perf-3s him
                 'Alaba saw him'
DirectionalityPronominalization in Lango is almost exclusively left-to-right anaphoric;
cataphoric reference seems always to be the result of afterthought, not
part of planned sentence construction as it may be in English. For instance,
(1) is perfectly acceptable in English:
            (1) when he; got back, Ojuki ate
In Lango, however, the controller NP precedes the pronoun or inflected
verb:
            (2)   i kare ante oj-u-k odwogo, ti cem
                  in time rel+part O. 3s-come+back-perf,
                      3s-and + then-hab eat-infin
                  'when Ojuk came back, he ate'10.2 Organizing events in discourseIn this section, I will discuss the mechanisms by which Lango marks se-
quential narration and non-sequential narration (simultaneity, repetition,
overlap, and lookback) in narrative discourse.       In particular, I will ex-
amine the three morphological aspects, the use of onworjo (Sec. 8.2.4) and
ϊ kare 'at the time, when' (Sec. 9.12.1), and the te construction (Sec. 9.6).
    In many languages, the function of indicating sequential narration
is performed by the perfective aspect.       But in Lango, this function is
performed by the te construction, which indicates that there is no break
in the linear sequence of events in a narration. A narrative discourse
                            Organizing events in discourse               253typically begins with a perfective, followed by a series of sentences with
te until a break in the narrative is reached. Sentences with te are inter-
preted as having the aspect of the inflected verb that precedes them,
despite the fact that te itself is inflected in the habitual aspect. Thus in
the discourse below, the te clauses are interpreted as perfective:
            ( 1 ) okelo od5k cen i bug
                  O. 3s-go+back-perf back to forest
            (2)   te wot nekkö dyel ä qättoro
                  3s-and+then-hab go-infin kill-infin goat att+part
                     person-indef
            (3) te dwogo päco
                  3s-and+then-hab come+back-infin home
                  Okelo went back to the forest. He went to kill
                     someone's goat, and then came back home'
A break in the narrative sequence can be accomplished by a clause which
repeats information already known. This function is frequently performed
by clauses headed by i käre:
            (4)   i käre äme odwogö paco
                  in time rel + part 3s-come+back-perf home
                  'when he got back home'
(4) repeats information contained in (3). Such repetitions are frequently
encountered in Lango narrative discourse and serve the function of mark-
ing off episodes, or sequences of sentences with a common theme. Notice
that the verb in (4) is perfective. (4) would ordinarily be followed by
another sequence of sentences with te, until the end of the new episode:
           (5)    te cämmo dyel
                  3s-and + then-hab eat-infin goat
           (6)    te nino
                  3s-and+then-hab sleep-infin
           (7)    i käre äm£
                  in time rel+part 3s-sleep-perf
           (8)    te cakko kxrppo bur
                  3s-and+then-hab start-infin dig-infin hole
                  'he ate the goat and then slept. After sleeping, he
                     started to dig a hole'
(7) is another repetition clause with i käre and the perfective, marking
off another episode. Such clauses almost always contain the perfective. (8)
continues the narration in the new episode.
    The functions of the perfective, then include the introduction of dis-
courses and episodes. The perfective is also used in an augmentative
254                           Structures in discoursefunction, expanding on an event originally coded with te, usually for
dramatic effect. Such sentences do not advance the narrative. For exam-
ple, (8) can be followed by (9) which serves this augmentative function:
            (9) okxrpo, okvrpb
                 3s-dig-perf, 3s-dig-perf
                 'he dug (it), he dug (it)'
    In addition to the discourse continuity function with te and the new
episode and augmentative functions with the perfective (both typically
repetitive), there is the background function. Backgrounded material is
outside the mainstream of the narrative sequence, and expresses situa-
tions or states explaining motives, attitudes, and desires, or events which
are subsidiary (typically simultaneous with mainstram, in-sequence
events) or negative, that is, those expressing negative results. Any of the
three aspects may be used for backgrounded material. The perfective is
used to code susidiary events, the habitual is used for states, and the
progressive for unbounded activities (Sec. 8.2.4).        For instance, (9)
above may be followed by sentences expressing backgrounded material:
            (10) ceq äryep
                 sun 3s-shine-prog
            (11) kwxrk ömäke
                 sweat 3s-catch-perf-3s
            (12) pe twero nworjrjo
                 neg 3s-be + able-hab fmd-infin
            (13) para onwOQo cire
                 worries 3s-find-perf 3s-oppress-hab-3s
                 'the sun shone, and he started to sweat. He was not
                    able to find it, and worries beset him'
Notice that none of the above advances the narrative sequence — even
the perfective in (11), but rather thay help explain it and provide the detail
to flesh it out and make it interesting. The narrative might continue as
follows:
            (14) okelo te tyekko kxrppD bur
                 O. 3s-and + then-hab finish-infin dig-infin hole
            (15) te wot yeppo ojiirk
                 3s-and + then-hab go-infin look-t-for-infin O.
                 Okelo then stopped digging the hole and went to look
                    for Ojuk'
Notice that the narrative sequence with te resumes immediately after the
augmentative and backgrounded material in (9-13).
                        Transitive and intransitive verb forms               255    Sentences with the lookback function are formed with onworjo (Sec.
8.2.4). When an event is presented out-of-sequence, having occurred prior
to the last event recorded in the narrative sequence, te cannot be used.
Instead the sentence is formed with onworjo and the verb is put in the per-
fective. 141 For instance, sentence (15) can be followed by (16), a lookback
sentence:
            (16) öjuk onworjo owoto gülu
                 O. 3s-find-perf 3s-go-perf G.
                 Ojuk had gone to Gulu'
   The discourse functions and their syntacticalizations can be sum-
marized below:
            discourse function                    syntacticalization
            -introducing discourse                any of the aspects,
                                                  depending on the sense
            -repetition, new episode             perfective
            -discourse continuity,                te construction
            uninterrupted narrative
            sequence
            -augmentative                        perfective
            -backgrounded material                any of the aspects,
                                                  depending on the sense
            -lookback                             onworjo with perfective
    It should be noted that te is used to indicate uninterrupted temporal
sequence even when following a verb inflected in the habitual or progres-
sive, as the following example shows:
            (1) kä dörj oyänö leyini ote pokko
                 when thus 3p-skin-hab animals-this 3p-and + then-hab
                   divide-infin
                 'When they skin animals, they divide them'
In this example, the te clause is given an habitual interpretation because
the inflected verb that precedes it is habitual; even so, it establishes a rela-
tion of temporal succession with that inflected verb.","[267, 268, 269, 270, 271]"

9.7 Conditional constructionsThere are two ways to form conditional constructions in Lango. The first,
for ordinary conditionals, is to express the protasis in the indicative
                                Cleft constructions                          233preceded by the conjunction kä 'if, and to express the apodosis with te if
it follows the protasis sequentially in time, or with the ordinary indicative
if it precedes the protasis in linear time sequence:
            ( 1 ) kä ica obinö te cem
                  if man 3s-come-perf 3s-and+then-hab eat-infin
                  'if the man came, then he'll eat/he ate (after he came)'
            (2) kä ic5 öbino, ocemo
                  if man 3s-come-perf, 3s-eat-perf
                  'if the man came, then he had eaten (before he came)'
    The second method is used for contrary-to-fact conditionals. With
these, both protasis and apodosis are preceded by kono. The verbs in both
clauses are in the ordinary indicative:
            (3) kono onworjo atie i ccm, kono ämiyi
                  if 3s-find-perf ls-be + present-hab with food, then
                      ls-give-perf-2s
                  'if I had food, I would have given it to you'
     For kono conditionals, the order is always protasis first, apodosis
second. However, kä clauses may also follow the apodosis, though this is
much rarer in texts than the order protasis-apodosis. When the protasis
follows the apodosis, it may represent an afterthought:
            (4)   obinö tedo kä rwot obinö
                  lp-come-hab cook-infin if king 3s-come-perf
                  'we'll cook if the king comes'
9.8 Cleft constructionsA sentence is a cleft sentence if it can be negated to mean that there is
something or someone satisfying the sentence other than the clefted (or
focused) NP. 132 Thus in English
            (1) it's Irving that Zeke slapped
is a cleft because
            (2) it's not Irving that Zeke slapped
presupposes that Zeke slapped someone and that someone is not Irving.
Lango has cleft sentences under this definition. These consist of the clefted
NP, followed by the third singular pronoun en, followed by a relative
clause. The relative clause consists of the fused attributive and relative
particles ame and the relativized sentence:
234                        The syntax of complex sentences            (1) okelo enn ame όρίό ojw to
                Ο. it rel+part O. 3s-hit-perf
                'it's Okelo that Opio hit'
The negation of (1),
            (2) pe en okelo enn ame όρίό ojw to
                neg he O. it rel+part O. 3s-hit-perf
                'it's not Okelo that Opio hit'
presupposes that Opio hit someone other than Okelo.
    The pragmatic effect of cleft is to establish a focussed item-in-contrast,
which is to say that in sentences like
            (3)     pi enn ante ojw to okelo
                  O. it rel+part 3s-hit-perf O.
                  'it's Opio that hit Okelo'
the speaker believes that the hearer either has a finite set of persons in
mind and the speaker is indicating that, of this set, Opio is the relevant
one, or that the hearer believes that someone other than Opio hit Okelo
and the speaker is setting the hearer right. Cleft is also used as an answer
to questions such as (4):
            (4) ij ojw to okelo?
                who 3s-hit-perf O.
                'who hit Okelo?'
Either (1) above or
            (5) όρίό ojw to okelo
                O. 3s-hit-perf O.
                Opio hit Okelo'
with Opio receiving contrasting stress can answer (4). The cleft is far more
common in this function, however.
    Since it is NP's, not nouns, that are clefted, nominal modifiers are
clefted along with their head nouns:
            (1) loc» dw Q έη ante aj ga k o
                man att + part 3s-big-hab it rel+part cat 3s-bite-perf
                'it's the big man that the cat bit'
Associative NP's may be clefted without their head nouns:
            (2) ogwag en ame gwo'kere okao rw t
                O. it rel+part dog-3sa 3s-bite-perf king
                'it's Ogwang whose dog bit the king'
    The syntactic rules governing the relative clause in clefts are the same
as those governing ordinary relative clauses, e.g. the rules governing
resumptive pronouns,
                                Cleft constructions                           235           (3) däkö       ante rwöt önekke twöl
               woman it rel+part king 3s-kill-ben-perf-3s snake
               'it's the woman that the king killed the snake for'
and the rule governing the relative form of a third singular perfective
verb:
           (4) rwöt       ante önekö twöl
               king it rel+part 3s-kill-perf snake
               'it's the king that killed the snake'
           (cf rwöt önekö twöl
               king 3s-kill-perf snake
               'the king killed the snake' )
    The pronoun       does not refer to the clefted      and is invariable:
           (1) atxnni        äme däkö öpitö
                 child-this it rel+part woman 3s-feed-perf
                 'it's this child that the woman fed'
           (2)   itinoni       ante däkö öpitö
                 children-this it rel+part woman 3s-feed-perf
                 'it's these children that the woman fed'
           (3) an        äme önenä
                 I it rel+part 3s-see-perf-ls
                 'it's me that he saw'
  is obligatory in clefts, except when the clefted        is an interrogative
word,
           (1) rja ame loca önenö?
                 who rel+part man 3s-see-perf
                 'who did the man see?'
or a pronoun:
           (2) pe ynm ante ajwati
               neg you rel+part ls-hit-perf-2s
               'it's not you that I hit*
In such cases    is optional; compare (2) and (3):
           (3) pe yin en ame ajwati
               neg you it rel+part is-hit-perf-2s
               'it's not you that I hit'
äme may be reduced to a or deleted altogether as in ordinary relatives:
           (1) borp        äme ödilö ni gig
                 clothes it rel+part 3s-pack-perf part full
                 'it's the clothes that she packed to the rim'
236                       The syntax of complex sentences            (2) böno enn a odilo ni git)
            (3) bogo enn odilo ni git)
As in relative clauses, aye may replace ame:
            (4) loca       /**»* X öneko gwök
                                 J
                 man it rel+part 3s-kill-perf dog
                 'it's the man who killed the dog*
Notice that in Lango there is no ambiguity, even leaving aside intonation,
between an identification sentence, where the item identified is an NP
with a relative clause, and its corresponding cleft. Compare (4) with the
identification sentence (5):
            (5) en loc» ame oneko gwök
                 he man rel+part 3s-kill-perf dog
                 'it's the man who killed the dog'
    A pragmatically similar construction, the Lango equivalent of the
 English pseudo-cleft, utilizes a more straightforward relative construction.
 Here the focussed NP is in final position and the presupposed (back-
grounded) material is a relative with an indefinite head occupying the sub-
ject slot in an identification sentence:
            ( 1 ) nätt ante oneko gwök ökelö
                 person rel-part 3s-kill-perf dog O.
                 'the one who killed the dog is Okelo'
There is typically a pause following the relative clause, but without the es-
tablishment of a new downdrift intonation contour.
    Clefting and topicalization can both apply to the same sentence. In
such cases, the topic appears before the clefted NP:
            (2) ökelö gwök         äme ökäö
                 O. dog it rel-part 3s-bite-perf
                 'it's the dog that Okelo was bitten by'
                 or Okelo, it's the dog that he was bitten by'
okelo is the topic, and gwök the clefted NP. The function of the topic, here
as elsewhere, is to establish the sentence orientation (Sec. 8.5.2): cleft es-
tablishes a focussed item-in-contrast. The two constructions, then, are not
operating at cross purposes and occur together naturally in discourse.
Notice that (2) cannot also mean 'it's the dog that Okelo bit' because then
the tonal contour on the verb would have to be okao, in accordance with
the rules for relativized subjects.

9.9 Embedded cleft and topic constructions9.9.1 Topic and cleft across sentence boundaries

                 3s-become+fat-perf

               Ogwang, Alaba wants Okelo to help him'
They may also originate in infinitive phrases:
           (3) ogwäg äläbä ämitto köjipe
               O. A. 3s-want-prog help-infin-3s
               Ogwang, Alaba wants to help him'
           (4) ogwarj äläbä öbinö me kojipe
                 O. A. 3s-come-perf for help-infin-3s
                 Ogwang, Alaba came to help him'
However, such sentences are a bit forced, though they are accepted and
understood.
    Topicalization is clearly subject to Ross' (1967) Complex NP Con-
straint: NP's may not be topicalized out of relative clauses or noun com-
plements. 133 The Coordinate Structure Constraint applies as well,
blocking the topicalization of an NP out of coordinated clause:
           (1)        öcämö rcc, enta okelo amato k5rj5
                 O. 3s-eat-perf fish but O. 3s-drink-perf beer
                 Opio ate fish, but Okelo drank beer'
           (2)   *ökelö        öcamö rsc, entä ömätö k5rp
                 O. O. 3s-eat-perf fish, but 3s-drink-perf beer
                 Okelo, Opio ate fish but he drank beer'
Notice, however, that topicalization applies across clause boundaries in
parataxis and serialization and is much more natural here than out of sub-
ordinate clauses:
           (3) kal dakö odio icS opyeto
                 millet woman 3s-press-perf man 3s-winnow-perf millet
                 the woman pressed the man, he winnowed it
                 'millet, the woman pressed the man to winnow it'
238                         The syntax of complex sentences             (4) okelo ögwäQ tek käte
                 O. O. 3s-strong-hab 3s-surpass-hab-3s
                 Okelo, Ogwang is stronger than him'
(cf relativization Sec. 9.2). This difference between parataxis and serializa-
tion, and true coordination will be discussed in Sec. 11.2.
     Resumptive pronouns are obligatory for lO's and human DO's topi-
calized across clause boundaries (note that non-human NP's such as kal
'millet' in (3) do not have DO pronominal substitutes: the transitive verb
alone suffices in such cases):
             (1) alabä okelo oyito gat olxrbe
                 A. O. 3s-climb-perf mountain 3s-follow-perf-3s
                 Alaba, Okelo climbed the mountain, he followed her
                 'Alaba, Okelo climbed the mountain toward her'
      Clefted NP's may also cross clause boundaries:
             (1) ogwai) enn äme äwipö ni alabä äköbbö ni öcwe
                      . it rel+part ls-hear-perf comp A. 3s-say-prog comp
                       3s-become+fat-perf
                   'it's Ogwang that I heard Alaba was saying was fat'
Cleft is subject to the CNPC and the CSC. Analogous to the situation in
relativization, NP's in the second clause of a paratactic construction can-
not be clefted to the beginning of the sentence:
             (2) *ogwarj        ante adiö okelo ojwate
                 O. it rel + part ls-press-perf O. 3s-hit-perf-3s
                 'it's Ogwang that I forced Okelo to hit'
A noun in the first clause can, however, be clefted:
                   v          v                   x       v             (/ \) okelo
                       ' 1 *· ^       ^ j ^ ^.
                             enn ame adio        · ^ j.
                                               ojwato    ^
                                                        ogwaq
                   O. it rel+part ls-press-perf 3s-hit perf O.
                   it's Okelo that I pressed, he hit Ogwang
                   'it's Okelo that I forced to hit Ogwang'
Nouns in the second clause of a serial construction can, however, be
clefted:
             (4)   rwot     ame okelo ocwe kate
                   king it rel+part O. 3s-become + fat-perf 3s-surpass-hab
                   'it's the king that Okelo is fatter than'
    The reason for the different restrictions on topicalization and cleft-
ing in paratactic constructions (topicalization, but not clefting is pos-
sible out of the second clause) has to do, it would seem, with the
respective functions of topicalization and cleft. Topicalization estab-
lishes a sentence orientation; what follows the orientation is typically
new information. A clefted NP is an item-in-contrast; what follows the
                           Embedded cleft and topic constructions        239
clefted NP is necessarily old information. If an NP like ogwag in (2) is
an item-in-contrast, the Lango strategy seems to be to note as back-
ground material only the second clause. For instance, one would say,
                   v
            /f \       ^    '     ^   A S I X ^ X V *   v.*
            (5)    ogwarj enn ame okelo ojwate
                   O. it rel+part O. 3s-hit-perf-3s
                   'it's Ogwang that Okelo hit'
instead of (2). The first clause in (2) is, presumably, background and redun-
dant; the second clause alone is sufficient to identify the situation and the
referent. But with topicalization, the fact that both clauses are being as-
serted as new information makes their presence mandatory if the mean-
ing they contain is to be communicated. So topicalization is allowable
under these conditions, but cleft is not. Since there is no problem embed-
ding serial constructions, which contain a single assertion like ordinary,
non-coordinate, complex sentences, clefting NP's in the second clause is
permissible.","[248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255]"

8.2.3 Benefactive and ventive stemsIn completing our survey of Lango verb stems representing different
valence schemes, mention should be made of ventive and benefactive
                               Verbal complex                          135stems. Ventive stems are available only for a small number of motion verbs
and are formed by adding the suffix -o to the root, geminating C2- The
sort of valence scheme represented by a ventive stem varies with each verb
root, but always refers to motion toward the speaker. For example, ven-
tive cwällö 'to send (to me)' has a valence scheme like its corresponding
Tr cwallo 'to send' with the addition of the first person reference:
           (1)   dakö ocwalo buk botgi          Tr
                 woman 3s-send-perf book to-3p
                 'the woman sent the book to them'
           (2)   däko ocwallo buk               Ventive
                 woman 3s-send-ven-perf book
                                                Oft
                 'the woman sent the book to me
Similarly ventive küttö 'to blow (to me)' has a valence scheme more like
Tr k-irtto than AN küto:
           (3)   yamo öküttö apüa                Ventive
                 wind 3s-blow-ven-perf dust
                 'the wind blew dust at me'
But when comparing ventive riggo 'to run (to me)' to other stems from
the same root, AN rirjo 'to run' and Tr riggo 'to run from', the ventive
resembles the AN stem:
           (4)   ätin origgo                     Ventive
                 child 3s-run-ven-perf
                 'the child ran to me'
And comparing mollo 'to float (to me)' with Tr rnMlo 'to float' and SA mol
'to float', the ventive most resembles the SA verb:
           (5)   yät omollö                      Ventive
                 wood 3s-float-ven-perf
                 'the wood floated toward me'
    Benefactive stems can be formed corresponding to any valence scheme
with an agent subject. In addition to the arguments specified by the non-
benefactive valence scheme, the benefactive references a benefactive (or
antibenefactive)   argument. For example, Tr cwallo 'to send' has a
benefactive counterpart cwälli 'to send for'. Compare (6) with (1) above:
           (6)   dakö ocwalli atin buk botgi                Tr-ben
                 woman 3s-send-ben-perf child book to-3p
                 'the woman sent the book to them for the child'
The benefactive is formed by geminating Cg of the verb root. The suffix
-i is attached to the root when the benefactive argument is a noun or a
third person singular non-human pronoun. In other cases, the appropriate
DO pronoun suffix is substituted:

                     'he brought it'
                  b. okelli däkö                   Tr-ben
                     3s-bring-ben-perf woman
                     'he brought it for the woman'
            (2)   a. ökela                                  Tr
                     3s-bring-perf-ls
                     'he brought me'
                  b. okella                                 Tr-ben
                     3s-bring-ben-perf- Is
                     'he brought it for me'
    Benefactive stems may correspond to both transitive and intransitive
valence schemes. The verbs Tr leggo 'to pray to' and AN lego 'to pray'
both have benefactive counterparts:
            (3)   olegga obana                              Tr-ben
                  3s-pray-ben-perf-ls God
                  'he prayed to God for me'
            (4)   olegga                                    AN-ben
                  3s-pray-ben-perf-ls
                  'he prayed for me'
8.2.4 Expression of tense and aspectThe Lango verb is inflected for three aspects, perfective, progressive, and
habitual, but is not inflected for tense. Out of context, however, the aspects
will be given a pragmatic tense assignment and tense distinctions can be
made by use of various auxilliaries, as we shall see.
    The three aspects are clearly distinguished inflectionally. Paradigms
are provided below for Tr cämmo 'to eat' (See Sec. 5.3.2 for an extensive
discussion of verb conjugation):
                           perfective          progressive           habitual
                    Is     acamo               acammo                acamo
                    2s     icämo               ic ammo               icämo
                    3s     ocämo               acammo                cämö
                                                    n                  n

        non-switch 3p      xcamo               icämmo                icämo
                                           Verbal complex                137
(Notice that the subject prefixes function as part of the aspect inflection.)
The use of non-switch reference forms is taken up in Sec. 9.3.2. The per-
fective alone distinguishes a form used with the pronomial subject en 'he,
she, it' and with relativized subjects (Sec. 9.2) from a form used with noun
subject and zero subjects:
            (1)   a.           ocämo
                       he 3s-eat-perf
                       'he ate it'
                  b . loca ocamo
                       ^   *   ^   V   ^
                       man 3s-eat-perf
                       'the man who ate it'
            (2)   a. loca ocamo
                     man 3s-eat-perf
                     'the man ate it'
                  b. ocamo
                       3s-eat-perf
                       'he ate it'
When the subject is a plural noun, the ordinary 3s form of the verb is used:
            (3)   mon camo
                  women 3s-eat-hab
                  'women eat it'
            (4)   *mon ocämö
                  women 3p-eat-hab
                  'women eat it'
See Sec. 8.7.7.
    The perfective is non-durative or bounded; that is, it is used to
describe completed activities bounded in time. It describes a single
dynamic event or process where something, either the subject or direct
object is affected by the action of the verb. Events coded in the perfec-
tive are viewed as a whole, whose completion is a necessary prerequisite
to a subsequent event.
    The progressive shares with the perfective that it describes a single
event or process affecting an entity. It differs from the perfective in that
the event or process is not viewed as completed or bounded. Rather it takes
the perspective of an ongoing process or event, whose completion is not a
necessary prerequisite for a subsequent event in a narrative discourse.
    The habitual contains both a true habitual and a stative sense. The
habitual like the progressive is durative and unbounded by fixed reference
points in time. The states or events described may be single or multiple
(true habitual). The attributive is fundamentally attributive, whereas the
progressive and perfective are applicative, describing events. A large
number of stative predicates are only inflected in the habitual.
138                           The syntax of simple sentences      The characteristics of the aspects are summarized below:
             perfective             progressive                habitual
             non-dura live/                  durative/unbounded
             bounded
                    applicative/process                        attributive/
                                                               non-process     Out of context, the perfective will be assigned a past interpretation,
the habitual a present, and the progressive either a present or future.
These interpretations are purely pragmatically based, and it is important
to emphasize that these aspects have no intrinsic tense. They can be as-
signed any tense with which they are semantically compatible. The
progressive and the habitual can, in the appropriate discourse context, be
assigned a past, present, or future interpretation. The perfective cannot
on logical grounds be assigned a present interpretation, but may receive
a past or future interpretation. Of course, a particular temporal inter-
pretation for any of the aspects can be insured through use of the ap-
propriate temporal adverbial, e.g. cwäji 'long ago', diki 'tomorrow', etc.
The discourse use of the aspects will be taken up in Section 3.2.
    A number of auxiliary verbs can be used to create definite tense inter-
pretations. A syntactically unique construction is formed with the 3s per-
fective of Tr nworjrjo 'to find'. In this construction, the verb onworjo 'he,
she, it found it' is typically placed initially in the sentence — though it may,
as in (1) below, be preceded by a topicalized NP — and is always conjugated
in the 3s perfective regardless of the person or aspect of the main verb:
             (1)   an onworjo abwöte
                   I 3s-find-perf ls-deceive-perf-3s
                     had deceived him'
             (2)   önwörjö loc» acem
                   3s-find-perf man 3s-eat-prog
                   'the man was eating'
             (3)   onworjo äkwänö i leb lärjö
                   3s-find-perf ls-study-hab in tongue Lango
                     used to study Lango'
With the progressive and the habitual, onworjo results in a simple past.
With the perfective, the interpretation is of a secondary or relative past
analogous to the English past perfect. The onworjo construction resembles
in certain respects the paratactic construction (Sec. 9.1.3) in that there are
two fully inflected verbs juxtaposed, but differs in certain crucial respects,
for instance in meaning, in the possibility for a nominal subject for the
second clause, etc.
    Two other verbs may be used as auxiliaries to indicate future, binö 'to
come' conjugated in the habitual aspect forms a simple future with the
                                Verbal complex                          139semantic main verb in the infinitive:
           (1)   bino cem
                 3s-come-hab eat-infin
                 'he'll eat'
With the progressive and perfective aspects, a motional or ingressive sense
is added. The progressive retains a future connotation, while bino in the
perfective yields a perfect or secondary past:
           (2)   abino cem
                 3s-come-prog eat-infin
                 'he'll come to eat'
           (3)   obi no cem
                 3s-come-perf eat-infin
                 'he's come to eat'
The verb mitto 'to want' forms an immediate future, again with the seman-
tic main verb in the infinitive:
           (4)   mitö cem
                 3s-want-hab eat-infin
                 'he's about to eat'
In this construction, mitto is always conjugated in the habitual. When
mitto is used to express desire, it is conjugated in the progressive:
           (5)   amittö cem
                 ls-want-prog eat-infin
                   want to eat'
    A special truncated form of bino 'to come' without the final -o also
figures as an auxiliary verb. This form is always conjugated in the perfec-
tive aspect and is followed by the semantic main verb also conjugated in
the perfective. It functions to mark contrastive affirmatives (like English
do) in the non-recent past:
           (1)   an abin akwalo gwenö
                 I ls-come-perf ls-steal-perf chicken
                   did steal the chicken'
(1) takes the form of a serial construction (Sec. 9.1.4).
    The verb tie 'to be present' conjugated in the habitual in a paratactic
construction followed by the semantic main verb in the progressive func-
tions to emphasize the in-process nature of the progressive:
           (1)   onwönp tie aöyö mac
                 3s-find-perf 3s-be-l-present-hab 3s-warm-prog fire
                 'he was warming himself by the fire'
This construction is used in certain set expressions such as:
140                              The syntax of simple sentences                (2)   kec tie anekke tutwal

                      'he was very hungry'
   bedo 'to sit, stay' expresses iterative aspect when followed by the

8.2.5 Argument inflectionThe Lango verb can be inflected for two arguments. Subject inflections
are prefixes and are obligatory for all verbs inflected for aspect and for
the subjunctive. The infinitive is inflected neither for aspect nor for sub-
ject. Subject inflections for the three aspects were illustrated in Sec. 8.2.4
All remaining verb agreement affixes are suffixes.
    The verb is inflected for one additional argument, though which ar-
gument will trigger verb agreement depends on the stem used and the
valence of the verb.      If a benefactive stem is used, only the benefactive
can trigger agreement:
            (1)   okella
                  3s-bring-ben-perf-ls
                  'he brought it back for me'
            (2)   ädökki
                  ls-go+back-ben-perf-2s
                    went back for your sake'
With a transitive stem, a non-human 3s direct object does not trigger
agreement — the stem itself marked as transitive is sufficient. Sentence
(1) above with a transitive benefactive stem illustrates this. In addition,
nominal DO's and lO's do not trigger agreement; instead the plain tran-
sitive stem is used. With non-benefactive stems, either pronomial DO's or
lO's may trigger agreement. They are not distinguishable from the
benefactive because of the stem difference. Compare (3) with (1) above:
            (3)   okela
                  3s-bring-perf-ls
                  'he brought me'
DO's trigger agreement preferentially over lO's; if both have human
referents and are pronomialized, the DO will agree with the verb and the
IO will be an object of bot 'to':
            (4)   rwot ocwale bota
                  king 3s-send-perf-3s to-Is
                  'the king sent him to me'
Sentences with a pronomial DO (other than a non-human 3s) and a
benefactive argument are avoided — independent pronouns are very rare
in postverbal position and are not used without a coreferential inflection
on a verb or preposition (Sec. 8.7.6).
    Infinitives are inflected for benefactive, DO, and IO arguments in the
same manner as verbs.
    A list of DO inflections is given below; IO inflections are identical:

            oneni                                    'he saw you (sg)'
            όηέηέ                                    'he saw him/her'
            όηέηό                                    'he saw it'
            onenowa                                  'he saw us'

            onenogx                                  'he saw them'
With the benefactive stem, the inflections are as follows:
            owilli tin                               'he bought it for the child'
            owilla                                   'he bought it for me'
            owilli                                   'he bought it for you (sg)'

            owilliwa                                 'he bought it for us'

             williwu    V                            'he bought it for you (pi)'

            owilligi                                 'he bought it for them'
8.2.6 'Floating' subject inflectionsA small number of particles, including pe 'not', mom (~ mam) 'not',
and pwod (~ pud) 'still, just' can take suject agreement in addition to
the subject agreement on the main verb. These forms always take
habitual subject prefixes regardless of the aspect of the accompanying
verb:
            (1)       an ape awoto k mp l
                      I ls-neg ls-go-perf K.
                      Ί didn't go to Kampala'
            (2)       apwod mom rt> awoto abor
                       ls-still neg yet ls-go-perf along
                      'before I go along'
The effect of this optional agreement is to emphasize a subject in contrast.
For instance, if one were to assert
                      v       K
           /ο \         ·*    '
           (3)        icamo  rec
                      2s-eat-perf fish
                      'you ate the fish'
an emphatic response might be:

                 I ls-neg ls-eat-perf fish
                   didn't eat the fish' (someone else did)
(4) represents an emphatic denial. This agreement is also found when
there are a number of preverbal particles, as in (2) above.
    The reason these particles and not others take subject agreement is
that all three are derived from verbs, pe and mom also function as nega-
tive existential predicates meaning 'to not exist, not be present* (Sec 8.4).
pwod seems to be derived from a verb also: pwvddvr 'to give sparingly'.","[150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159]"

5.2.3 Personal namesPersonal names in Lango generally consist of the prefix o- for masculine
names and a- for feminine names added to a root that refers to some cir-
cumstance attending the birth of the individual bearing the name. Some
of these names are analyzable from the standpoint of modern Lango,
others are not:
 (1)        /äpio     'first of twins'
       ocen/acen      'second of twins'      (from cen 'behind, back')
       okelö/äkelo    'born after twins'
       6t5/at5        'born after mother     (from tao 'to die')
                       had miscarried'
       otim/atim      'born in the bush'     (from tim 'bush, wild
        or atima                              counrty')
       6d5k/ad5k      'mother threatened     (from dok 'to go back')
                       to go back home'
       olira/alfra    'born in Lira'         (from lira 'Lira')
Other sorts of personal names include agent nouns,
 (2)   alobo          One born after pre-    (from lobo 'earth')
                      vious children died'
and simple, unmodified nouns:
 (3)   gem            One whose parent       (from g«m 'stinginess')
                      is stingy'
       bäpä           One born before the    (from bäpä 'debt')
                      bride-price is paid'
5.2.4 Associative paradigmsIn this section we are concerned with the suffixation on nouns of associa-
tive pronouns, both alienable and inalienable. For the alienable/in-
alienable distinction, see Sec. 8.7.2.
    The singular associative suffixes can be divided into two groups, the
plural associatives showing no such distinction:
78                         The structure ofLango words            (1)                                           A              B
                  first person singular (Isa)            -a              -na
                  second person singular (2sa)           -               -
                  third person singular (3sa)            -e or e         -mere
                  first person plural (Ipa)                        -wa
                  second person plural (2pa)                       -wu
                  third person plural (3pa)                        -gf
The A set are suffixed to consonant final nouns in inalienable associative
constructions. The set are attached to vowel final nouns in inalienable
associatives and to all nouns in alienable associatives:
            (2)                   Inalienable            Alienable
                  tyin 'leg'      tyin + ä               ty£n + na
                                  'my leg'               'my (animal) leg'
                                  [tyfenä]               [tyfcnna]
                  re mo 'blood'   remo + na              remo + na
                                  'my blood'             'my (animal) blood'
                                  [remönä]               [remönä]
The plural affixes are used for both alienable and inalienable associative
constructions:
            (3)                   tyfcn + wa52           tyin + wa
                                  Our legs'              Our (animal) legs'
                                  [tyfenwa]              [ty nwä]
    In general, the suffixation of these forms involves simply the applica-
tion of the ordinary tone sandhi (Sec. 4.4.2), cluster simplification (Sec.
1.2.3), and vowel harmony rules (Sec. 2.5.2) already discussed. There are,
however, a number of irregularities, particularly as regards the suffixa-
tion of the A set. Let us first consider the more regular cases involving the
suffixation of the B set and the plurals.
    Below are some paradigms illustrating the suffixation of the B set and
the plurals to nouns exemplifying the various tonal possibilities. All the
following involve alienable possession, but recall that an inalienably pos-
sessed noun with a final vowel would inflect in exactly the same way. Un-
derlined vowels are stressed:

    When a disyllabic noun with a stem vowel is followed by the Β set suf-
fixes, the word may optionally undergo contraction (sec. 5.1.2.2), whereby
the stem vowel is deleted. The resulting cluster consisting of the final con-
sonant of the root and the initial consonant of the suffix undergoes cluster
simplification. As with coalescence, the tone of the stem vowel is absorbed
into the root.

80                        The structure ofLango words(Cntr = contraction, CS = cluster simplification, VH = vowel harmony)
Note that since the final vowel of äpwö 'hare' is a stressed root vowel, not
a stem vowel, the word may not undergo contraction. Paradigms for two
words showing contraction are provided below. Note that only the sin-
gular forms are given since the plural forms do not undergo contraction
and are thus the same as the forms given in (4):
            (6)               bäip 'dress'   tula Owl'
                  Isa         b5qqa          tul'la
                  2sa         bOQiji         tul'li
                  3sa         boQQere        tu 1'ere
    Inalienably possessed nouns that end in vowels take the B set suffixes,
as noted above:
           (7)                remo 'blood'   nero 'uncle (i.e. mother's
                                                               brother)'
                  Isa         remona         neronä
                  2sa         remoni         neroni

                  3pa         remogi         nerogi
These forms may also undergo contraction. However, once the stem
vowel is lost, these words are treated like consonant final inalienably
possessed nouns and so take the A set suffixes. This means that there is
no gemination since there is no consonant in the suffix:
           (8)    Isa         rema           nera
                  2sa         remi           neri
                  3sa         reme           nere
Notice again that contraction does not occur before the plural suffixes
so the plural forms given in (7) are the only ones possible for these
words.
    The A set suffixes occur only with inalienably possessed, consonant
final nouns. The chart below lists the tone taken by these suffixes: 53

                  3sa      gute              dele
Nouns with final LH include a class of nouns listed in footnote 44 and
nouns like remo which become rem- following contraction:
           (14)            ty|n'leg, foot'   lak'tooth'      remo'blood'
                  Isa      tyena             laka            rema
                  2sa      tyeni             laki            remi
                  3sa      tyene             lake            reme
Again, with the plural associative suffixes, there is no difference between
alienable and inalienable possession. We have, therefore, forms like:
           (15) Ipa        emwä        dogwa         gutwa   tycnwa
These words can be interpreted as either alienably or inalienably pos-
sessed nouns.
     With the plural suffixes, H(L) nouns behave like ordinary      nouns.
So, for em 'thigh' we have emwä, but not em'wa. However, with a HL
noun like gwok 'dog', we have the expected gwok'wä.
     wie 'head', yic 'belly', and gee 'back', words which exhibit the 0/y/c
alternation (Sec. 1.4.4), have the 0 alternant before inalienable associa-
tive suffixes. However, because of the presence of the morphophoneme
/y/ in root final position, these forms take the A set suffixes, not the B
set:
82                         The structure of Lango words            (16)             /wly/'head'        /ney/

                   3pa       wigi               gegi
However, the [c] alternant is found (and geminated) in alienable possession:
            (17)   Isa       wicca              gecca
                              etc.               etc.
    Certain nouns which, on semantic grounds, Ought' to take alienable
or inalienable suffixes, take suffixes from the wrong set. For example, cer-
tain nouns expressing familial relationships, e.g. 'mother' and 'brother',
are found with alienable suffixes:
            (18)   tot     'mother'           töttere      'his mother'
                   omin    'brother'          omin'ere     'his brother'
Driberg (1922, p. 303) records omin'ere, so the phenomenon is not recent.
Most nouns expressing blood relations take the expected inalienable
possession:
            (19)   nero    'uncle'            nere         'his uncle'
                   papo    'father'           pape         'his father' (note
                                                             the irregular tone)
On the other hand, we find nouns which ought to take alienable suffixes
taking inalienable ones. The words 6t 'house' and tug 'home' illustrate this:
            (20)   uda     'my house'    (note also the irregular tone
                                           on the suffix)
                   tuga    'homeward, to my home*
at, however, does appear on occasion with the expected alienable affixes:
            (21)   ottä    'my house'
    Certain nouns exhibit irregularities when inalienable associative suf-
fixes are attached to them. For example, pi 'water' can refer to body mois-
ture (sweat, tears, urine) and so can be inalienably possessed. Contrast the
forms in inalienable and alienable possession:
            (22)            Inalienable        Alienable
                   1 sa     pig9               pinä

associa lives:
           (23) pig wäg
                water eye
                'tears'
Alienably possessed forms for this word are regular. The word cul 'penis'
is also irregular in inalienable possession:
           (24)              Inalienable     Alienable
                  Isa        cuna            culla
                  2sa        cuni            culli
                  3sa        cune            cullere
Many speakers have cun in place of cul: cun is treated as a regular H
noun.
    Under certain conditions, associative pronominal suffixes may be
attached to words other than nouns. See Sec. 8.7.2.","[93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"

4.4.3 The interaction of tone sandhi and coalescenceCoalescence, both internal (Sec. 2.6) and external (Sec. 2.7), takes place
prior to the operation of the tone sandhi rules discussed in the last sec-
tion. Contraction (Sec. 5.1.2.2) also applies before the tone sandhi rules.
In both cases, the tone associated with the lost vowel is incorporated into
the root. Some derivations follow:

(Notice that when resyllabification applies in (3), /o/ does not harmonize
with the root vowel /a/: when the underlying form of a word is aharmonic,
as in the case of dako, a vowel replacing the lost stem vowel -o via resyl-
labification will not change its [ATR] value to harmonize with the root.)
     Unusual tonal contours may arise as a result of coalescence and con-
traction. For example, when the noun bvra 'cat' receives the plural suf-
fix -e, the stem vowel is deleted and its tone is absorbed into the root in
the usual way. The result, however, is to produce a very complex tonal
contour for the root vowel:

lows:

The Ή is simply reinterpreted as Η following L — recall that all H's are
redundantly downstepped following a L.

4.5 The irregular H(L) class nounsThere are remarkably few irregularities with regard to the Lango tone
sandhi rules. The only notable irregularity involves a class of monosyl-
labic nouns whose citation forms have H but which behave tonally as
though they were HL. We will refer to these nouns as the H(L) nouns to
differentiate them from ordinary monosyllabic H nouns like d6g 'mouth'
and monosyllabic HL nouns like gwök 'dog'. A list of H(L) nouns follows:
           (1)   em       'thigh'                  yit         'ear'
                 düd      'buttocks'               yib         'tail'
                 tik      'chin'                   wum         'nose'
                 pirn     'forehead'               leb         'tongue'
                 wök      'gap in teeth'           kör         'breast, chest, middle'
                 tök      'nape'                   man         'this'
With the exception of man 'this', all H(L) words are body part nouns, and
ordinarily occur as heads of inalienable associative constructions (Sec.
8.7.2).
     Compare the behavior in tone sandhi of the H noun dog 'mouth* and
the H(L) noun wum 'nose'. Despite the fact that both nouns have H in cita-
tion forms, wüm must be represented as HL underlyingly to account for
its behavior:
           (2)        H

                 nose ground+squirrel
                 'the ground squirrel's nose'
                  H L                          H      L
                  L/                ™          I      I

                 nose crocodile
                 'a crocodile's nose'
Compare wüm with gwok 'dog', whose behavior in constructions like those
64                                  Toneabove is identical, differentiating both from dog:
            (4)    H L H                      H

                  'ground squirrel dog' (i.e. one for hunting ground
                                                         squirrels)
                   H L L                      H L

                  dog crocodile
                  'crocodile dog' (i.e. one for hunting crocodiles)
However, unlike gwök, when wum is utterance final it has a H, not a HL:
            (5)      H L
                     / % J              ( n o change)
                  dog gwok
                  mouth dog
                  'a dog's mouth'
                     H L                      H
                    /N
                  dog wum
                               l          /\
                                        dog wum
                  mouth nose
                  'nostril'
    H(L) nouns differ from HL nouns in one further respect. When
alienable associative suffixes (Sec. 5.2.4, 8.7.2) are added to H(L) nouns,
they behave as though their tonal contours were H and not HL. Compare
the following:
           (6)    Underlying
                  Tone
                   L        wäg + na    —>        wägga     'my (animal) eye'
                   H        cwip+nä     -*·       cwippa    'my liver meat'
                   HL       gwok + na   -»        gwok'ka   'my dog'
                   H(L)     leb+na      -*        lebba     'my tongue meat'
    As the examples in (6) show, the H(L) noun leb behaves like the H
noun cwip, and not like the HL noun gwök, with alienable associative suf-
fixes. This applies also to all the plural associative suffixes, whose form
does not vary with an alienable or inalienable interpretation. So, for ex-
ample, for yit + wa Our tail' we have yiwa, not the expected yit'wa. This
contrasts with the regular behavior of HL nouns, where gwök+wä be-
comes gwok'wa.
    A special rule, which we will refer to as H(L) Simplification [H(L)S],
applies to just the H(L) class when they are prepausal and when they are
                             The irregular H(L) class nouns                 65followed by single alienable associative suffixes and alienable/inalienable
plural associative suffixes:
           (7)   H L                           H
                 V
                 wum
                                   H(L)S
                                             wum
                                                1
                 'nose'
                    H L                          H
                                   H(L)S
                 dag wum                     dag wum
                 'nostril'
                 HL H                           H
                                   H(L)S
                 V l
                 lebwa                       lebwa
                 tongue-lpa
                 Our tongue'
This rule does not apply to ordinary HL words like gwök, as we saw in (5)
above.
    H(L) nouns have a further irregularity, but one that they share with
ordinary HL nouns. Inalienable associative suffixes have an underlying
high tone, as the following examples show:
           (8)   warj+a                       warja           'my eye
                 cwip+a                       cwijia          'my liver'
However, when these suffixes are added to H(L) nouns, the suffixes take
on a HL contour, which is not predicted by the tone rules:
           (9)   wum-t-a                     wum»              my nose
                 leb + a                     lebä             'my tongue'
HL nouns share this irregularity — see Sec. 5.2.4. The normal application
of the tone sandhi rules would predict:
           (10) H LH                         H'H
                                   FS1
                                             JJ               *Ie'ba[There are some other irregularities with singular inalienable associative
suffixes. See Sec. 5.2.4.]
 PART TWO:
MORPHOLOGY
              5. The structure of Lango words5.1 General considerations5.1.1 RootsIn Lango as in other Lwo languages, roots are archetypically of the form
CiVC2- 47 Some roots lack GI or Cz, but, apart from the preposition i 'in'
and the attributive participle ä, no root lacks both GI and C2- There are
very few roots without GI, almost all of them basically verbal in sense.
    Noun, adjective, and prepositional roots have inherent lexical tone,
though when nouns and adjectives are inflected for plurality, their tone
may change in synchronically unpredictable ways:
              (1)   SG      PL
                    tag     togqi        'spear'
                    jok     J0g£         'spirit'
                    Ivt     lüdi         'stick'
                    gwök    gwoggi       •dog'
                    dit     dito         'big, old'
                    dworj   dogo         •large'
                    räc     racu         'bad'
For this and for some other reasons discussed below, both singular and
plural forms of these roots must be listed in the lexicon.
    The tone of verbs - the effect of tone sandhi rules apart - is totally a
function of aspect and mood (Sec. 5.3.2). Intransitive infinitives, however,
have idiosyncratic tone (see Sec. 5.3.1) as do nominalizations (Sec. 5.2.1),
but the two are not always in agreement,
              (2)   kop     'speech'             kob      'to speak (intr)'
                    cam     'eating, food'       cem      'to eat (intr)'
                    pwop    'teaching'           pwöp     'to teach (intr)'
arguing against the assignment of lexical tone to the verbal root. Even
apart from tone, the form of both intransitive infinitives and nominalizations
is not predictable and so both must have their own lexical entries in any case.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85]"
"
8.4 Existence, location, and possessionExistential and presentative constructions are formed with tie 'to exist,
be present' when affirmative and pe or mom 'to not exist, not be present'
when negative. The subjects in existential sentences are almost always ac-
companied by -moro, the indefinite affix (Sec. 8.7.4):
            (1)      gwok'karo tie i 5t
                     dog-indef 3s-be+present-hab in house
                     'there's a dog in the house'
            (2)      cennoro pe
                     ghost-indef 3s-be + not-t-present-hab
                     'there are no ghosts'
Locative expressions are formed in the same manner:
            (1)      tiekan
                     3s-be+present-hab here
                     'it's here'
148                       The syntax of simple sentences           (2)   kwac mom
                 L. 3s-be+not+present-hab
                 'Leopard wasn't there'
    Possessive sentences are also formed with these existential predicates.
Three patterns have been observed, differing primarily in thematic struc-
ture. When the possessor is topic, the following is likely to be used:
           (1)   okelo tie gwok
                 O. 3s-be+present-hab with dog
                 Okelo has a dog'
This structure contrasts with (2), used when the possessed item is topic:
           (2)   gwök tie bot ökelo
                 dog 3s-be+present-hab to O.
                 'the dog is Okelo
Both patterns are negated by substituting pe or mom for tie. When the
possessor and possessed are topics as a unit, the following syntagm involv-
ing topicalization (Sec. 8.7.3) of the possessor is commonly encountered:
           (3)   okelo gwok'kere pe
                 O. dog-3sa 3s-be + not+present-hab
                 Okelo doesn't have a dog'
     In translating the English absolute possessive pronouns (mine, yours,
etc.), two constructions are possible. One can either use the usual posses-
sive sentence construction,
           (1)   gwokki tie bota
                 dog-this 3s-be+present-hab to-ls
                 'this dog is mine'
or one can use the preposition me 'for, in order to' conjugated for person
— see Sec. 5.6.3 for paradigms and discussion:
           (2)   gwokki rnera
                 dog-this for-Is
                 'this dog is mine'
           (3)   gwokki meri
                 dog-this for-2s
                 'this dog is yours'
This construction is also available for nouns,
           (4)   gwokki me ojisk
                 dog-this for O.
                 'this dog is Ojuk's'

8.5 Deviations from basic order Lango permits remarkably few deviations from the basic order outlined
in Sec. 8.1. Aside from some variation in the placement of indirect ob-
jects and adverbiale, only topicalization can affect the simple linear
order of constituents in the simple sentence.","[163, 164, 165]"
"
5.4.4 Deverbal adjectivesDeverbal adjectives can be formed from verbs by prefixing a- and suffixing
-a to the verbal root, which takes on a HL contour (simplified by UFS
before the following H of the suffix -ä. The suffix is subject to vowel
harmony.
            (1) Infinitive                           Deverbal Adjective
                jiwallo 'to bear (a child)'          ajiwä'lä Own begotten'
                paddo 'to           flatten'         apa'da     'flat'
                ryebbo 'to turn upside               arye'ba 'upside down'
                            down'
                jiäkkö 'to grind coarsely'           ajia'ka      'coarse'
                dillo      'to sqeeze toge-          ädi'lä       'squeezed toge-
                            ther, pack'                            ther'
                dwoayo 'to twist'                    adwo'a       'askew, twisted'
                                  Prepositions                             107
    These forms have the peculiarity that they are not conjugated for per-
son, unlike ordinary adjectives. Further, they usually occur with a copular
verb like bedö 'to sit, stay, be' or doko 'to become':
            (2)   bokcinz ärye'ba
                  box-this upside+down
                  'this box is upside down'
                  bokcxnx bedö arye'ba
                  box-this 3s-sit-hab upside+down
                  'this box is upside down'
   A copular verb is always used (at least in my data) when the subject
agreement is not 3s:
            (3)   adoko arye'ba
                  ls-become-perf upside+down
                  'I'm upside down'
5.5 PrepositionsLango has a small set of true prepositions, i.e. words that can express loca-
tive and relational senses without forming complex phrasal units with i
On, at, in, about, to, from' — see Sec. 8.8 for discussion. Even the true
prepositions are transparently related to (or derived from) nouns. For ex-
ample, te 'under' also has the nominal meaning 'end, side, back' and can
be found with this sense in many nominal compounds: te poto 'the bound-
ary of a field', te wie 'the back of the head', te ""yit 'the back of the ear'.
    Most prepositions take their pronominal objects as inflections. These
inflected prepositions take object suffixes which are identical to those used
in inalienable possession of nouns (Sec. 5.2.4). However, those preposi-
tions ending in a vowel do not use the expected nasal initial affixes (-na
'my' as opposed to -ä), but instead insert an epenthetic /r/ between the
preposition and the suffix (Sec. 1.5.2). Tonal patterns in general follow
those for inalienable possession, but there are some idiosyncracies.
Paradigms follow:
            (1)    mi'for'        bot'to'        tfc'under'     pi'for, ac-
                                                                  cording to'
            Is     mera           böte           terä           pirä
            2s     meri           böti           teri           piri
            3s     mere           böte           tere           pire

                                   [bodgi]
108                        The structure of Lango words                  kä'instead of     tu'under'       kede/kede'with'

           3p     kagi              tugi            kedgi
     As noted above, some prepositions are not inflected. For example, bäla
'as, like' is followed by independent pronouns:
           (2)    bala an           'like me'
                  bala yin          'like you'
                    etc.","[122, 123, 124]"
"7. Gemination in the formation of transitive infinitives seems historically
to be simply another case of gemination via cluster simplification. Driberg
(1923) lists forms like [libdö] corresponding to modern [lib»o] 'to lie in
wait', though Lango speakers do not now accept the former. In verbs,
where C2 of the CiVC2 root is 0, [y] is found in environments where
gemination of C2 would be expected. Compare the following:
            ägälö         delayed it'           ätpoö 'I woke up smn'
            gal»o      'to delay it'            tpo«yo 'to wake up smn'
Synchronically, the transitive infinitive suffix could be viewed as -yo,
the /y/ conditioning cluster simplification. As noted in several places in
this grammar, /y/ patterns with the anterior consonants and not with
its fellow palatals (see, for example, footnote 9), suggesting an origin
for -yo that corresponds to the form above given by Driberg. Alterna-
tively, one could view the appearance of [y] in [tpö»yö] as a case of/y/
epenthesis (Sec. 1.4.5).",[284]
"
9.1.1 Hypotaxis (subordination)
Hypotaxis is the syntactic state of affairs where one clause is subordinate
to another. There are various types of hypotactic constructions in Lango.
In hypotaxis, one clause is referred to as the main or matrix clause, the
other as the subordinate clause. Asubordinator specifies the syntactic (and
semantic) relation between the clauses. The two clauses are bound
together into a syntactic unit so that the entire construction constitutes a
single assertion.
    Hypotaxis is prominent in complementation (Sec. 9.3). Two types
of hypotactic complements are employed, one with indicative and the
other with subjunctive morphology. Both types of complements share
the same subordinator ni, referred to as a complementizer. The com-
plementizer is generally obligatory (Sec. 9.3.1) and comes first in the
complement clause:
            ( 1 ) arjeo ni loca dägö tic
                 ls-know-hab comp man 3s-hate-hab work
                   know that the man hates work'
            (2) amxtto ni däkö öwilli ätin buk
                ls-want-prog comp woman 3s-buy-ben-subj child book
                  want the woman to buy the child a book'
Notice that the word order of the complement clause is the same as that
of the main clauses.
    The complement obligatorily follows all elements of the matrix clause.
192                        The syntax of complex sentencesSo, if the complement is the logical subject of the matrix verb, it is
obligatorily extraposed:
            (1) myerö äyek käl
                  3s-be + necessary-hab ls-sieve-subj millet
                    must sieve millet'
            (2)   ber ni rwot omio loca dyär)
                  3s-good-hab comp king 3s-give-perf man cow
                  'it's good that the king gave the man the cow'
Subject complements, even when extraposed, are unidiomatic in Lango
except in the case of modals like (1). The meaning of (2) would likely be
expressed by something like (3):
            (3) yia yöm            rwot omio loca dyär]
                  stomach-lsa 3s-soft-hab because + of it king 3s-give-perf
                     man cow
                  Tin glad that the king gave the man a cow'
Impersonal constructions like (1) and (2) are notably rare in Lango (see
Sec. 11.1); judgements are likely to be rendered personally, as in (3).
    Noun complements are possible in Lango, though of infrequent oc-
curence:
            (1) rwot omio cxk ni äkwäl gweno
                  king 3s-give-perf order comp ls-steal-subj chicken
                  'the king gave an order that I steal the chicken'
            (2) cik ä rwot ni äkwäl gwenö öyomo yia
                  order att + part king comp ls-steal-subj chicken
                  'the king's order that I steal the chicken pleased me'
Sentences such as (2) are highly unnatural in Lango, judging by speakers'
reactions, and it is difficult to assess their grammatically. 114 As with verb
complements, noun complements are more natural when they occur last
in the sentence. The meaning of (2) would likely be rendered by a para tac-
tic construction:
            (3) rwot omia ni äkwäl gweno oyomo yiä
                  king 3s-give-perf-ls comp ls-steal-subj chicken
                     3s-soften-perf stomach-lsa
                  the king ordered me to steal a chicken, it pleased me
                  'that the king ordered me to steal a chicken pleased me'
    It is only in hypotactic complements that switch reference morphol-
ogy is available (Sec. 9.3.2).
    Relative clauses are also formed by means of subordination in
Lango. The relative clause follows the antecedent, or head, which is an
argument of the matrix clause. The details of the word order of rela-
tive clauses vis-ä-vis other members of the noun phrase was described
                                      Introduction                          193in Sec. 8.7.1. Relative clauses are usually preceded by the attributive
particle a and the particle me merged together as ante and referred to
as the relative particle. The complementizer ni is not used with rela-
tive clauses. Details of the syntax of relative clauses will be found in
Sec. 9.2.
    Adverbials may also be formed with subordinate constructions. Their
syntax will be discussed in Section 2.9.","[207, 208, 209]"
"69. Driberg (1923) distinguishes between a middle in -ere and a passive
in -e. (Since Driberg does not write tone or vowel quality, I'm assuming
his forms correspond in this way to the modern forms.) Neither my data
nor comparative data lend support to such a distinction.
    The middle suffixes -ere and -e both derive historically from -re, a
reflexive suffix which developed from a noun meaning 'body' (cf. Shilluk
re 'body', pi rei).
    Both suffixes might be taken to derive synchronically from /re/,
though this would require a couple of ad hoc rules.70. ätinä was also recorded.
278                                Endnotes71. This is surely related to the -g- element in the plural forms of the
independent demonstrative and associative pronouns. Note also the in-
dependent 3p pronoun gin.","[293, 294]"
"
4.4 Tone sandhi4.4.1 General principlesOne remarkable characteristic of tone sandhi in Lango is that, with almost
no exceptions (Sec. 4.5), the underlying arrangement of highs and lows is
preserved without loss despite considerable changes in the association
links between tone and segment. Under certain conditions, underlying L's
may surface as downstep on an adjacent H, but this is really the only dis-
ruption of the tonal contour (and a relatively minor one since a signals
the presence, either synchronically or diachronically, of a L).
    As an example of what the above means, consider the following:
           (1)        ögwäg       -+            nen ogwärj
                  see-imper merekat
                  'look at the merekat!'
On the left is the underlying tonal pattern corresponding, in this case, to
how each word would be said in isolation. On the right is the actual pronun-
ciation which results from applying the tone sandhi rules to the underly-
ing pattern. In order to make more apparent what has happened during
the course of the derivation, we will make use of some of the conventions
of autosegmental tone analysis, "" according to which tone is regarded as
an independent layer or tier associated with the segmental level by general
principles and language specific rules. In our adaptation of this approach,
(1) is represented as (2):
           (2)     LH    L                  L     HL
                   V /\
                  nen ogwag      -»
                                                  V
                                                ogwärj
In examining (2), we see that while the association between tone and seg-
ment undergoes considerable change, the basic L H L pattern remains un-
disturbed. Autosegmental analysis makes this aspect of the tone sandhi
rules much clearer.
50                                        Tone     The following conventions are observed in notations like (2):
              (a)   L H    (b) H L                     (c) Η Ή
                    V = []     V                  =[ ]     V        = []
                     a          a                           a
              (d) A single L or H is associated with any unbroken string
                  of vowels with low or high tones, including the L or H
                  component of contour tones:
                     L      H    L
                     ι /ντκ
                     zmaji dokkz rac
                     im ji d kki rac
                     liver cow-this 3s-bad-hab
                     'this beef liver is bad'
[Note: These conventions are adopted for descriptive convenience only.]
4.4.2 RulesTone rules have the effect, then, of altering the association between the
tonal and segmental tiers, changing the underlying or lexical association
between tone and segment into that which obtains in actual utterances.
What follows is a list of Lango tone sandhi rules, which are taken to apply
in the order given:
I. Underlying Fall Simplification (UFS)A HL L sequence simplifies to Η Ή:
              (1)    H L H                        H Ή

                                       Tone sandhi                                              51This rule differs from FS1 (Fall Simplification 1: see below) in that FS1
applies to both derived and underlying HL's (under somewhat different
conditions), but UFS applies only to basic, underlying HL's. Compare the
last example with the one below:
            (2)   LHL H
                  W   /
                  aneni
                   ls-see-perf-2so
                   Ί saw you'
Two rules given below, HS1 and RS, will apply to this underlying form,
yielding aneni. Since aneni contains a derived HL (produced by HSl), it
does not undergo UFS.","[65, 66, 67]"
"5.6 Pronouns5.6.1 Personal pronouns: independent formsThe affixal personal pronouns have already been discussed (Sec. 5.3.2,
5.2.4).
     The syntax of the independent, or free-standing, personal pronouns
is discussed in Sec. 8.7.6. Below is a list of these forms:
           (1)    an        T
                  yin      'you (sg)'
                  en       'he, she, it'
                  wan      'we'
                  wun      'you (pi)'
                  gin      'they'
5.6.2 Demonstrative pronouns: independent formsThe affixal demonstratives were discussed in Sec. 5.2.6.
    The independent, or free-standing, demonstrative pronouns are built
off a stem ma- to which are suffixes the affixal demonstratives:
           (1)                   SG               PL
                                               m
                  'this'         man               agi
                  'that'         mänö             mägö     also: mano/mago
                  'yonder'                 mäcä
   man is irregular: the expected form is *mani. Just as with the affixal
demonstratives, the singular forms often substitute for plurals.
                                     Pronouns                             1095.6.3 Asociative pronouns: independent formsThe affixal associative pronouns are discussed in Sec. 5.2.4.
    The independent associative pronouns, i.e. free-standing forms, are
in origin prepositional phrases based on the preposition me 'for' con-
jugated for person. In the singular, these associatives are exactly like the
conjugated forms of the preposition (see Sec. 5.5), but they differ in having
a separate plural paradigm used to agree with plural antecedents:
            (1)                    SG            PL
                   'mine'          mera          mega
                   'yours (sg)'    meri          megi
                   'his, hers,     mere          mege
                    its'
                   Ours'           mewa          megwa
                   'yours (pi)'    mewu          megwu
                   'theirs'        megi          meggx
These forms are used in constructions like:
            (2)   man 'mera
                  this mine
                  'this is mine'
                  magi 'mega
                  these mine
                  'these are mine'
The singular forms are sometimes used in place of the plurals.
   See Sec. 8.4 for the syntax of these forms.","[124, 125]"

5.7.3 Distributive numeralsDistributive numerals are formed either by doubling the number,
            (1)    äcel äcel             One by one, one at a time'
                   apar apar             'by tens, ten at a time'
                   ädi ädi               'how many at a time?'
or by placing the preposition kede between the doubled numbers:
            (2)    äcel ked äcel         One by one, one at a time'
                   ädi ked ädi           'how many at a time?'
                                   Numerals                                1135.7.4 Multiplicative numeralsThere are two methods for forming multiplicatives. The first involves
simply quantifying the noun wäg 'eye':
            (1)    wäq äcel            Once; one eye*
                   wäg äboro           'eight times; eight eyes'
The other method, more commonly used, involves placing the preposition
i before the nominal: if the numeral has the prefix ä-, the prefix is deleted:
            (2)    i eel               Once'
                   i bic               'five times'
                   i bicel             'six times
                   i pyer ary5         'twenty times'
                           6. ReduplicationTrue morphological reduplication (as opposed to repetition) is not much
used in Lango. The odd lexicalized reduplicated noun apart, productive
reduplication is only found with adjectives. On the syntax of reduplicated
and repeated forms, see Sec. 8.10.
    In adjective reduplication, GI and V of the root are reduplicated. If V
has a contour tone, only the onset is found on the reduplicated syllable.
The unreduplicated syllable is stressed:
           (1) Adjective                    Reduplication
               bfcr          'good'        bsbfcr
                rac          'bad (sg)'    raräc
                räcü         'bad (pi) 1   rarecü
                pwe          'smelly'      jiwejiwe
                dwog         'big'         dwodwog
                tck          'strong'      t€t£k
                bülu         'blue'        bübülu
The only irregular reduplication in my data is tutwal 'very': the more
regular twätwäl is heard, but it is not as idiomatic.
                              7. CompoundsCompounds in Lango can be constructed from nouns and infinitives in
any combination of two or more words. The leftmost member is the head;
the interpretation is one of any contextually reasonable association be-
tween the component elements, though some compounds have taken on
idiosyncratic lexical meanings. The elements are simply juxtaposed in a
syntactic configuration like that of inalienable associative constructions.
The rightmost member receives primary stress:
           (1)   wag ot
                 eye house
                 'window'
                 5t cem
                 house eat-infin
                 'restaurant'
                 pig wag
                 grain eye
                 'eyeball'
                 dog bo1 go
                 mouth dress
                 'hem'
                 dog del
                 mouth skin
                 'lips-
                 dye at
                 middle house
                 'floor'
                 dye tyen
                 middle leg/foot
                 'sole of foot'
                 gwok 'romo
                 dog sheep
                 'sheep dog'
    Some words lose their final consonant in compounds when they are
not the rightmost member, e.g. wie 'head' and gin 'thing':
           (2) wiat
               head house
               'roof
116                                  Compounds                 gi wie
                 thing head
                 'hat'
Notice that in the last example, wie is compound final and so retains its
final consonant.
    Ordinarily, only singular nouns participate in compounds.
    Associative pronominal suffixes can be affixes to compounds:
            (3) Dt cemmä
                 house eat-infin-lsa
                 'my restaurant*
            (4) yom cwipe
                 softness liver-3sa
                 'his happiness'
            (5) ewer cwijie
                 drip-infin liver-3sa
                 'his sadness'
Whether the associative affixes are alienable or inalienable depends on the
sense of the item they are suffixed to: (4) and (5) above show inalienable
possession, but (3) shows alienable possession.
    Compounds are an idiomatic and productive means of expression in
Lango.","[128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"

5.2.2 Agent nounsAgent nouns are formed by prefixing to the root ä- for the singular and
o- for the plural. Both prefixes condition zero-consonant effects - see Sec.
 1.6. (The nominalizing prefixes a- and o- discussed in the last section do
 not condition zero-consonant effects.) A variety of stem vowels can be
 found with agent nouns; some have no stem vowel at all.
     Agent nouns are formed from roots whose basic sense is verbal, adjec-
tival, adverbial, and even nominal. They can refer to people, animals, or
objects, though with an instrumental cast to the sense of the latter. They
can be made from compounds and even from phrases containing con-
jugated verbs - for the latter, see Sec. 7. Agent nouns are commonly en-
countered in spoken Lango.

        ämwolo 'humble person'               mwol   'soft, humble'

        opat         'strangers'
Those adjectives which have different singular and plural forms (sec. 5.4.2)
employ them in their nominalizations, along with the appropriate sg/pl
prefix. The tone found in the root of the agent noun is usually the same
as in the corresponding adjective, but note ämwolo above, which also adds
a stem vowel. The noun ätin 'child' (< tin 'small') has the irregular plural

otino/otrno is also heard).

"10. There are a very few words for which gemination would have to be in-
dicated lexically. All of these are either borrowings,
           pamma      'cotton'               (from Swahili pamba)
           tanna      'bed'                  (from Swahili ki-tanda)
           koppo      'cup'                  (from English cup of)
           cüggu      'black ant'            (from Swahili chuguu 'ant heap')
or are complex in origin, though the latter may not be easily segmentable:
           okko             'completely, entirely, utterly'
           wokki            'a few minuts ago'
                            'plant yielding strong rods'
Such words may represent the vanguard of lexical gemination in Lango,
though there is a tendency, especially with the borrowings, to degeminate:
tanna becomes tänä 'bed' for many speakers. (See also Sec. 4.3.) At this
stage, such cases of gemination are still few, and the great majority of
cases of gemination are morphophonemically predictable.",[285]
"
5.3.3 Benefactive and ventiveFor the use of the benefactive ventive stems, see Sec. 8.2.3.
    The benefactive suffix is -i and, like vowel initial suffixes in general,
it displaces the stem vowel causing the stem vowel tone to be absorbed
into the root. The benefactive suffix conditions gemination on Cg of the
root. It may attach to transitive or intransitive verbs. The benefactive suf-
fix -i is not subject to progressive vowel harmony.

   The pronominal object suffixes in the benefactive are the same as those
described for direct objects in the last section, -i is lost in coalescence
before suffixes beginning with vowels, but is retained before those begin-
ning with consonants. In all cases, the gemination remains. Below are
some paradigms illustrating this affixation. All verbs are 3s habitual:

                  Iso         ted'da            too'ya            kel'14
                  2so         ted'di            too'yi            kel'li
                  3so         ted'de            too'ye            kel'le
                  Ipo         teddxwa           tooyiwa           kellxwa
                  2po         teddiwu           tooyiwu           kelliwu
                  3po         teddigi           tooyxgi           kelligi
Forms like teddxwa, teddiwu, etc. are also possible (Sec. 4.4.2). Notice the
regressive vowel harmony conditioned by -wu on benefactive -i (e.g.
kelliwu).
    In the subjunctive benefactive, both -i and -u are deleted, their tones
absorbed into the root and C2, as usual for benefactives, is geminated:
           (3)   okellx
                 3s-bring-subj-ben
                 '(that) he bring it for'
(Recall that the tone sandhirule HSl is blocked by gemination (Sec. 4.4.2),
so we do not get *okelli.) Pronominal objects are affixed normally:
           (4)   äkelli
                 ls-bring-subj-ben-2so
                 '(that) I bring it for you'
                 akelligi
                  ls-bring-subj-ben-3po
                 '(that) I bring it for them'
   The ventive suffix is -o. Before it the stem vowel deletes, its tone is
absorbed by the root, and C2 geminates, -o conditions regressive vowel
harmony on the root.
   Ventives can be constructed from transitives or intransitives, but
100                              The structure of Lango wordsthey do not take pronominal suffixes, nor are benefactive ventives pos-
sible. When the sense requires either objects or benefactives, ventives
are usually avoided, but if they are used, independent pronouns or
prepositional phrases are used to supply the additional argument:
              (5)   ocwallo pi däkö
                    3s-send-perf-ven for woman
                    'he sent it towards/to me for the woman'
      Ventives inflect normally for aspect and mood:
              (6)   icwällo
                    2s-send-perf-ven
                    'you sent it toward me'
                    icwal'lo
                    2s-send-hab-ven
                    'you send it towards me'
                    icwallo
                    2s-send-prog-ven
                    'you are sending it toward me'
                    cwallo
                    2s-send-imper-ven
                    'send it toward me!'
   A few examples of ventive infinitives and their transitive/intransitive
counterparts are provided below:
        (7)   TR/INTR Infinitive                    Ventive Infinitive

              yitto/yito 'to climb'                  yittö 'to climb toward me'
              jiikko/pikö 'to move away              piggö 'to move slightly
                           slightly'                               toward me'
              m5115/m51 'to float'                   mollo 'to float toward me'
              cwällo 'to send'                       cwallo 'to send toward me'
              riggo/rxgo 'to run away'               rirjrjo 'to run toward me'
              mwomere 'to rush away'                 mwommö 'to rush toward me'
I have one example of a ventive verb derived from an adjective root:
              (8)   lyet 'hot'                       lyetto 'get heated'
The last example also illustrates the fact that ventives can acquire
idiosyncratic meanings. As a further example, consider:
              (9)   matto/mato 'to drink,            matto 'to score (e.g. at soccer)'
                          suck in smoke,
                          get beat up'

    There are two middle voice suffixes: -fi, which geminates C2 of the
root, and -ere, which does not. -έ is suffixed to roots whose C2 is alveolar
or /y/; -ere is used in all other cases:69

                  ceg      'close'           cegere
   There are no separate middle voice affixes for different persons or
numbers:
           (2)    c gere
                 1 s-heal-perf-mid
                 Ί healed myself

                 1 p/3p-heal-perf-mid
                 Ve/they healed ourselves/themselves'
There are no benefactive or ventive middles.
   The middle voice inflects regularly for aspect and mood:
           (3)   aponne
                 1 s-hide-perf-mid
                 Ί hid myself

                   2s-hide-imper-mid
                   'hide yourself!'
The subjunctive suffixes -i and -u delete before the middle voice affixes,
their tone being absorbed into the root.
    Both transitive and intransitive verbs have middle voice counterparts.","[114, 115, 116, 117, 118]"
"9.2 Relative clausesRelative constructions consist of a noun head (or antecedent) followed by
the relative clause. The order of the other elements in the NP is discussed
in Sec. 8.7.1. The relative clause itself consists of the attributive particle
                                                                           1 97
ä and the particle me fused together to form the relative particle amc,
followed by a sentence, syntactically like sentences in main clauses except
that now a noun slot will be empty or filled with a pronoun interpreted as
coreferential with the head. So a sentence like
            (1)     loca märö gwök
                    man 3s-like-hab dog
                    'the man likes the dog'
is occurring in a relative construction will take the form
            (2) loce ame märö gwok
                man rel + part 3s-like-hab dog
                'the man that likes the dog'
where the subject slot within the relative clause is empty and interpreted
as coreferential to the head, locä. Or alternately, it will take the form
            (3) gwokk äme locä märö
                dog rel+part man 3s-like-hab
                'the dog that the man likes'
where the direct object slot is empty and interpreted as coreferential to
the head noun gwök. In (2), we say that the subject has been relativized
on, and in (3), the direct object has been relativized on.
    When the Su and DO are relativized on, the noun slot is left empty,
as in (2) and (3) above. It is also left empty if the IO is relativized where
the IO is not the object of bot 'to' (Section 1.5.1):
            (4) loca ame rwot omiö lyec
                man rel-part king 3s-give-perf elelphant
                'the man that the king gave the elephant to'
However, if a benefactive, an associative, or an object of a preposition is
relativized on, a pronoun coreferential to the head is obligatorily placed
216                         The syntax of complex sentencesin the noun slot. This pronoun is referred to as a 'resumptive' pronoun
and takes the form of an ordinary object pronoun:
                Indirect object with bot
            (5) loca am« rwot ömio lyec böte
                  man rel+part king 3s-give-perf elephant to-3s
                  'the man that the king gave the elephant to'
                benefactive
            (6) atinn ami däkö owille buk
                  child rel+part woman 3s-buy-ben-perf-3s book
                  'the child that the woman bought a book'
                  associative
            (7)   loca amc atinnere omato cäk
                  man rel+part child-3sa 3s-drink-perf milk
                  'the man whose child drank the milk'
                  object of preposition
            (8) däkö arne rwot olego obaqa pire
                  woman rel+part king 3s-pray-perf God because+of
                  'the woman that the king prayed to God because of
Rclativization in Lango manifests the hierarchy of NP slots established by
Keenan and Comrie (1977): The subject, direct object, and advanced in-
direct object slots do not require a resumptive pronoun whereas all other
slots do. All noun slots in simple sentences can be relativized on, as well
as noun slots in hypotactic complement clauses:
            (9) lyecc äme rwot ämitto willö
                  elephant rel + part king 3s-want-prog buy-infin
                  'the elephant that the king wants to buy'
            (10) lyecc äme rwot ämitto nx loca wil
                  elephant rel + part king 3s-want-prog comp man
                     3s-buy-subj
                  'the elephant that the king wants the man to buy'
            (11) loca ame rwöt ämitto                 lyeccere
                  man rel+part king 3s-want-prog see-infin elephant-3sa
                  'the man whose elephant the king wants to see'
     Relativization in Lango obeys Ross' Complex NP Constraint, 1 9ft as
well as the Coordinate Structure Constraint for true coordinate structures
(i.e. those conjoined by ento 'but' or     Or'). The Sentential Subject Con-
straint is inapplicable since sentential subjects do not occur (Sec. 9.1.1).
NP's in serial constructions and in the first clause of a paratactic construc-
tion can be relativized on:
                                 Relative clauses                           217            (1) loc» ame ogwag odio ojwato okelo
                man rel+part O. 3spress-perf 3s-hit-perf O.
                'the man that Ogwang forced to hit Okelo'
            (2) Ioc9 ame tek katö okelo
                man rel+part 3s-strong-hab 3s-exceed-hab O.
                'the man that is stronger than Okelo'
However, there appears to be a constraint against relativizing NP's in the
second clause of a paratactic construction; no analogous constraint holds
for serial constructions:
                paratactic
            (3) *loca ami okelo odio ogwarj ojwätö/ojwäte
                man rel+part O. 3s-press-perf O. 3s-hit-perf/
                   3s-hit-perf-3s
                'the man that Okelo forced Ogwang to hit'
                serial
            (4) loco ame okelo tek katö
                man rel+part O. 3s-strong-hab 3s-exceed-hab
                'the man that Okelo is stronger than*
    The infelicity of (3) hold with or without resumptive pronouns. Notice
that this constraint on relativization cannot be subsumed under the Coor-
dinate Structure Constraint because relativization is not possible on NP's
in either conjunct of a true coordinate construction. Topicalization is pos-
sible even out the second clause of a paratactic construction (Sec. 9.9.1);
topicalization obeys the CNPC and the CSC in true coordinate construc-
tions. However, cleft is like relativization in this regard (9.9.1). Recall
that nouns in hypotactic complements can be relativized on. Compare (3)
with (5):
            (5) loca äme okelo odio ogwäq ni öjwät
                man rel+part O. 3s-press-perf O. comp 3s-hit-subj
                'the man that Okelo pressed Ogwang to hit'
     In relative clauses, elements such as prepositions or head nouns with
relativized associatives may not be fronted, unlike their English counter-
parts. This, no doubt, simply reflects the fact that there is no relative
pronoun for them to be fronted with.
     The relative particle ame may be replaced, especially in western
dialects, by aye. The relative particle is not obligatory; the attributive par-
ticle alone may suffice, or neither may be present:
            (1) gwokk ame otoo
                 dog rel+part 3s-die-perf
                 'the dog that died'
218                      The syntax of complex sentences            (2) gwokkaotoo
                dog att+part 3s-die-perf
                'the dog that died'
            (3) gwokk otoo
                dog 3s-die-perf
                'the dog that died'
Notice that gemination of the final consonant of the head noun occurs
even when the attributive particle (or the relative particle, which contains
the attributive particle) is not present, signalling in this way an attribu-
tive, as opposed to a predicative, relation.
    When the subject is relativized on, a perfective verb in the relative
clause takes on a special tonal contour (see Sec. 5.3.2). Compare (3)
with (4):
           (4) gwök otoo
               dog 3s-die-perf
               'the dog died'
     Relative clauses in Lango are always restrictive, which is to say they
always presuppose the existence of another entity that could be charac-
terized by the head noun, but not by the relative construction as a whole.
So the relative construction in sentence (1)
           (1) rwottame däktäl ödok
                king rel+part doctor 3s-go+back-perf
                'the king who is a doctor went back'
presupposes the existence of a king who is not a doctor. The English non-
restrictive counterpart:
           (2) the king, who is a doctor, went back
which does not presuppose the existence of another king, does not have
a Lango counterpart. The usual translation of (2) would be:
           (3) rwot däktäl. odok
               king 3s-doctor-hab. 3s-go+back-perf
               'the king is a doctor, he went back'
Notice, however, that (2) and (3) are not equivalent. (2) presupposes that
the king is a doctor, while (3) asserts it.
    Attributive adjectives constructions, such as (1),
           (1) rwott ä räc
                king att+part bad
                'the bad king'
could be analyzed as a relative clause construction. As mentioned above,
the relative particle ami can be replaced by the attributive particle ä in
relative constructions and rac could be analyzed as a predicate adjective.
                                Relative clauses                           219In other words, it could be claimed that (1) is really a variant of (2):
           (2) rwöttämeräc
                king rel+part 3s-bad-hab
                'the king who is bad'
It turns out, however, that there are some important meaning differen-
ces between (1) and (2). (1) is ambiguous between reference and referent
modification (Bolinger 1967), whereas (2) only has referent modification.
In stating (3),
            (3) rwot räc
                king 3s-bad-hab
                'the king is bad'
one asserts that there is an individual who is a king and that that individual
is bad. Thus, it is the actual referent, the individual who is a king, that is
being modified in (3). However, in (4),
            (4) en rwott ä räc
                he king att+part bad
                'he's a bad king'
it is conceivable that the individual who is the king is, in fact, a good per-
son, but is bad as a king. In other words, it is the reference (being a king)
rather than the referent (the individual) that is modified in (4). (1) is am-
biguous between the two interpretations, though the reference modifica-
tion interpretation is the primary one. (2), on the other hand, can only
have referent modification. For this reason, we must distinguish between
attributive adjective constructions like (1) and relative constructions like
(2), despite the fact that ame can be replaced by a in relative constructions.
     Information questions are commonly constructed with relative
clauses,
            (1) äwene ame rwot oneko twol iye?
                 when rel+part king 3s-kill-perf snake in-3s
                 'when did the king kill the snake?'
            (2) rjä ä rwot onekke twol
                who att+part king 3s-kill-ben-perf-3s snake
                'who did the king kill the snake for?'
especially when the interrogative word is subject:
            (3) r)a ame omato k5no?
                 who rel+part 3s-drink-perf beer
                 'who drank the beer?'
These constructions are semantically like clefts (where a focused element
is put in initial position) and structually like them also except for the lack
of the otherwise obligatory third singular pronoun en (Sec. 9.8).
    Relative clauses in Lango require overt heads except in certain time
220                              The syntax of complex sentencesconstructions (Sec. 9.12.1). That is, there are no 'headless' relatives in
Lango as in the following English sentence:
           (1) he likes what he eats
In Lango, an overt head noun must be present:
           (2)      märö gin ame camo
                    3s-like-hab thing rel+part 3s-eat-hab
                    'he likes the thing/what he eats'
Further, there is no relative clause extraposition in Lango.
    Cleft and pseudo-cleft constructions (Sec. 9.8) and various adverbials
(Sec. 9.12) involve relativization.","[231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236]"
"8.10 Reduplicative constructions and gerundsBoth verbs and adjectives can occur in reduplicative constructions. There
are two sorts of reduplication. The first is restricted to adjectives. The syll-
able initial consonant and the following vowel (together with its tone) are
reduplicated (see Sec. 6):
            plain                       reduplicated
            räc       'bad'             rarac        'sort of bad'
            ber       'good'            beber        'sort of good'
            cek       'short'           cecek        'sort of short'
            c51       'black'           c6c51        'blackish'
            bulu      'blue'            bübülu       'bluish'
                       Reduplicative constructions and gerunds             175These forms can have attributive or predicate function:
            (1)   twollx raräc
                  snake-this 3s-bad-hab
                  'this snake is sort of bad'
            (2)   twoll ä raräc
                  snake att+part bad
                  'the sort of bad snake'
This reduplication has a diminutive sense.
    The second sort of 'reduplication' in fact involves a special sort of
repetition of the verb. For the repetition, the verb root is given a high
tone and preceded by ä- and followed by -a. (See also Sec. 5.3.5.) The
resulting forms are frequently referred to by Niloticists as gerunds. 12
            gerund                   infinitive
            äcamä                   cammo           'to eat'         Tr
            acema                   cem             'to eat'         AN
            awota                   wot             'to walk, go'
            änekä                   nekko           'to kill'
            äbedä                   bedo            'to sit, stay'
            äberä                   ber             'to be good'
The meaning of the gerund in this construction is one of mild emphasis,
and is often used in opposition to a contrary opinion:
            (1)   abino abina awo'ro
                  ls-come-perf come-ger yesterday
                    did come yesterday'
It can also have the additional sense that the activity so described is simply
or merely carried out:
            (2)   päkö omyelo amyela
                  girl 3s-dance-perf dance-ger
                  'the girl just danced'
    The gerund usually appears after the verb or adjective and its com-
plements, but before adverbials and sentence particles — it never precedes
the predicate:
            (1)   loc» odok ädokä
                  man 3s-go+back-perf go+back-ger
                  'the man went back'
            (2)   loca önekö gwok änekä okko
                  man 3s-kill-perf dog kill-ger completely
                  'the man killed the dog'
176                       The syntax of simple sentences           (3)   rwot olima älzmä
                 king 3s-visit-perf-lso visit-ger
                 'the king visited me'
           (4)   kobba äkob» bä
                 2s-speak-ben-imper-lso speak-ger please
                 'please speak to me'
           (5)   awoto kampala äwota
                 ls-go-perf K. go-ger
                   went to Kampala'
The gerund may also reduplicate infinitives:
           (6)   bedo abeda räc
                 sit-infin sit-ger 3s-bad-hab
                 'idleness is bad'
Compare the following set:
           (1)   cemmi räc
                 food-this 3s-bad-hab
                 'this food is bad'
           (2)   cemmi rarac
                 food-this 3s-bad-hab
                 'this food is sort of bad'
           (3)   cemmi räc äräcä
                 food-this 3s-bad-hab bad-ger
                 'this food is really bad'
    Gerunds have some other important functions which will be discussed
in Sec. 9.9.4.
    In addition to adjective reduplication and the gerund, there is a form
of reduplication restricted to nouns. This form of reduplication is not
productive. When a reduplicated form exists, there is usually no non-
reduplicated form. Phonologically, the entire noun usually reduplicates:
           (1)   m5t5-m5to tie i tyene
                 elephantiasis 3s-be + present-hab in leg-3sa
                 'he has elephantiasis'
8.11 Expression of adverbial notions8.11.1 InstrumentInstruments are expressed as the object of the preposition i and less com-
monly as objects ofkede 'with* or ke 'with':
                         Expression of adverbial notions                177           (1)   loca oneko twol «e kede f- pala
                                      Lke      J
                 man 3s-kill-perf snake with knife
                 'the man killed the snake with the knife'
Some consultants reject kede and ke in this construction, but all accept i:
           (2)   ätin öcelö dyärj i gwerj
                 child 3s-hit-perf cow with stone
                 'the child hit the cow with a stone'
           (3)   däkonx cemo i malaga
                 woman-this 3s-eat-hab with fork
                 'the woman eats with a fork'
           (4)   loca owoto i motaka
                 man 3s-go-perf in car
                 'the man went by car'
8.11.2 Location and directionWith the exception of expressions formed with tc 'under', locational ex-
pressions formed with prepositional phrases all involve the preposition i.
These expressions with i may be simple prepositional phrases when they
mean 'in' or 'at',
           (1)   an dar) atie i cükul
                 I also ls-be+present-hab in school
                 'I'm also at school'
           (2)   wan ocemo i at cem
                 we 1 p-eat-perf in house food
                 'we ate in a restaurant'
or complex phrases with body part or locational nouns (Sec. 8.8) when
they specify a more specific locative relationship:
           (1)   bedo i wi k6m her
                 sit-infin in head chair 3s-good-hab
                 'it's good to sit in a chair'
           (2)   rwöt ocürj z rje at
                 king 3s-stand-perf in back house
                 'the king stood behind the house'
           (3)   dakö obedo i larjet mac
                 woman 3s-sit-perf in side fire
                 'the woman sat beside the fire'
178                        The syntax of simple sentencesDeictic pro-forms and adverbials may also be used to indicate location:
           (1)   tiekan
                 3s-be+present-hab here
                 'he's here'
           (2)   kwäc tie abedo pip
                 L. 3s-be+present-hab 3s-sit-prog ground
                 'Leopard is sitting on the ground'
           (3)   adak cen

           (4)       en
                 it here
                 'here it is'
    Where the sense of the verb supplies the direction, or where the direc-
tion is supplied from previous discourse or known to the discussants,
simple prepositional phrases with i are used:
           (1)   apwö odwogo i bug
                 H. 3s-come+back-perf from forest
                 'Hare came back from the forest'

                 woman 3s-move-perf through house
                 'the woman moved through the house'
If the object of i is a familiar place name or päco 'home, village', i may
be omitted:

                 man 3s-go-perf G.
                 'the man went to Gulu'
But if the place so named is unfamiliar, i must be used:
           (4)   loc» owoto i tue son
                 man 3s-go-perf to T.
                 'the man went to Tucson'
    When a more specific direction needs to be specified for clarity, tu
'toward' or combinations of prepositions are possible:
           (1)   däkö obeo tu at
                 woman 3s-move-perf toward house
                 'the woman moved toward the house'

                 'the lion walked under the branch'
Deictic pro-forms and adverbials are also possible:
           (1)   binkän
                 2s-come-imper here
                 'come here!'

                   woman 3s-go+out-perf out
                   'the woman went out'
Two directional phrases can occur together:
             (4)   ädok paco i yuganda
                   ls-go+back-perf home to U.
                     went back home to Uganda'
      Ventive verbs (Sec. 8.2.3) code direction toward the speaker:
             (1)   rwot ocwallo lyec
                   king 3s-send-ven-perf elephant
                   'the king sent the elephant in my direction'
8.11.3 AccompanimentAccompaniment is indicated by prepositional phrases with i, or when greater
clarity is desirable (since the meaning of i is only that some relation exists
between its object and the predicate), with kede, ke, or ginni 'with':             (1)   loca obino< x    vdäkö
                             \ kede /
                   man 3s-come-perf with woman
                   'the man came with the woman'
             (2)   rwöt ocwalo däko i wärägä
                   king 3s-send-perf woman with letter
                   'the king sent the woman with the letter'
             (3)   äpwö obinö rwätte ginni kwäc
                   H. 3s-come-perf meet-mid-infin with L.
                   'Hare came to meet with Leopard'
    Accompaniment and NP conjunction are indicated by the same
prepositions. But the essential difference between them in sentences
like the following,
             (1)   atin kede gwok odäk
                   child with dog 3s-go+back-perf
                   'the child and the dog went back'
             (2)   atin odök kede gwok
                   child 3s-go+back-perf with dog
                   'the child went back with the dog'
is the thematic status of the object of kede. If gwok 'dog' is a joint topic
with atin 'child', then (1) would be used; otherwise (2) is used. (2) could
also receive the gloss 'the child went back with a dog', but the gloss 'the
                         Expression of adverbial notions                 181child and a dog went back' is not available for (1). That meaning would
have to be rendered by (2), or by (3):
           (3)   ätin kede gwok'koro odak
                 child with dog-indef 3s-go+back-perf
                 'the child and a dog went back'
Nouns in preverbal position are interpreted as definite unless made in-
definite with the indefinite suffix.","[190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197]"
"9.4 Comparative constructionsThe equative relation can be indicated in two ways. The first involves bälä
'as, like':
           (1) däkoni ber bälä yin
               woman-this 3s-beautiful-hab as you
               'this woman is as beautiful as you'
The second clause in (1) has been truncated, the second predicate ibir
'you are beautiful' having been ellipted. bälä is a conjunction; as the ex-
ample shows, it is not conjugated like simple prepositions.
    The other technique for indicating the equative relation involves
serialization (Sec. 9.1.4) with the verb cällo 'to resemble' as the second
verb in the series:
           (2) däkoni ber ca'H
               woman-this 3s-beautiful-hab 3s-resemble-hab-2s
               'this woman is as beautiful as you'
           (3) däkoni pe ber ce'li
               woman-this neg 3s-beautiful-hab 3s-resemble-hab-2s
               'this woman isn't as beautiful as you'
           (4) aber äca'li
               1 s-beautiful-hab l s-resemble-hab-2s
               'I'm as beautiful as you'
                            Comparative constructions                      229     Simple comparison may be indicated by means of serialization too.
The first verb in the series establishes the standard; the second verb, katto
'to surpass' or looyo 'to defeat, exceed', the item compared:
            (1) äryekäka'ti
                ls-clever-hab ls-surpass-hab-2s
                'I'm cleverer than you'
            (2) däko pe dwog kätö icS
                woman neg ls-big-hab 3s-surpass-hab man
                'the woman isn't bigger than the man'
            (3) itikiloorwot
                2s-strong-hab 2s-exceed-hab king
                'you're stronger than the king'
Simple comparison can also be indicated by a non-serial construction, still
utilizing loayo or katto. The standard of comparison is a nominal object
of the preposition i:
            (4) dako 155 ic5 i dwög
                woman 3s-exceed-hab man in bigness
                'the woman is bigger than the man'
    There is no special superlative construction. The superlative is simply
a comparative where comparison is made to the relevant class of entities:
            (5) lyeci d5n5 0155 i kin leyi
                elephants 3p-big-hab 3p-exceed-hab in middle animals
                'elephants are the biggest animal'
            (6) Mohammed AH en tek 155 i wi lobo
                M.A. he 3s-strong-hab 3s-exceed-hab in head world
                'Mohammed Ali is the strongest in the world'
Notice that looyo in (5) and (6) is morphologically transitive, just as in (3).
    Adjectives may also be used to compare clauses. In such cases the
clauses are nominalized:
            (1) cämmö gwennä okelo oyotoyot 155 kwällogi ä
                 eat-infin chickens att+part O. fast 3s-exceed-hab
                   steal-infin-3p att+part O.
                 Okelo eats chickens faster than Opio steals them'
When two clauses are compared directly, only the second is a nominal:
                   x                         v
                 ^ 1 1^  '

230                        The syntax of complex sentences9.5 Ingressive constructionswot 'to go, walk' and other motion verbs are often used pleonastically in
a serial construction resulting in an ingressive construction. In this con-
struction, wot often retains a motional sense, but its primary function
seems to be to reinforce perfective aspect — it is never found in the
progressive or habitual aspects:
           ( 1 ) loca owoto olvb5 dako
                  man 3s-go-perf 3s-follow-perf woman
                  'the man followed the woman'
           (2) d k owoto okwano
               woman 3s-go-perf 3s-read-perf
               'the woman read'
As a serial construction, the ingressive can also take the form of an in-
finitive
           (3)     mitto wot yepp cem
                  ls-want-prog go-infin look + for-infin food
                  Ί want to go look for food'
or subjunctive:
           (4)     mitto ηί όρχό ow t oyep cem
                  ls-want-prog comp O. 3s-go-subj 3s-look + for-subj food
                  Ί want Opio to go look for food'9.6 Coordinating sentencesAs noted in Sections 8.7.5 and 9.1.2, Lango makes little use of true con-
junction relative to English, because while ento 'but' and ορό Or' can be
analyzed as true conjunctions (though the verbal status of όρο is quite
clear), there is no Lango equivalent of English 'and'.
    The 'and' relation is expressed in Lango in a number of ways depend-
ing on the sense. If mere, non-sequential conjunction is intended, simple
juxtaposition of sentences is used:
           ( 1 ) rwot cam rirjo. en m t k rp
                  king 3s-eat-hab meat, he 3s-drink-hab beer
                  'the king eats meat and drinks beer'
If simultaneity is indicated, a paratactic construction is frequently en-
countered involving repetition of each predicate:
                              Coordinating sentences                      231            (2) rwöt onwono cemö mato cemo mato
                 king 3s-find-perf 3s-eat-hab 3s-drink-hab 3s-eat-hab
                    3s-drink-hab
                 'the king ate and drank'
 Other sorts of 'and' relations may also be accomplished with parataxis
 (Sec. 9.1.3).
     When sequence is indicated (i.e. when 'and' is equivalent to 'and then'),
a special syntagm, the t£ construction, is used, te is a verb, is always con-
jugated in the habitual aspect, and takes the semantic main predicate as
its infinitive complement:
            (1) an atedo rirjo ate cammo
                 I ls-cook-perf meat ls-and+then-hab eat-infin
                   cooked the meat and then I ate it'
te constructions never begin a discourse and are always interpreted as
having the aspect of the inflected verb preceding them. The function of
the te construction is to advance the narrative, indicating continuity in the
linear sequence.
    Intonationally, te constructions can either function as an intona-
tional adjunct of the first clause, as in parataxis, or as a completely
separate unit:
            (2) obi no te cammo
                 3s-come-perf 3s-and+then -hab eat-infin
                 'he came and then he ate'
            (3) lanö öyä i Sudan, ote bino te gik gülu
                L. 3s-go-perf from S. 3p-and+then-hab come-infin
                   3p-and+then-hab stop-infin G.
                 'The Lango came from the Sudan. They came and
                   stopped at Gulu'
(2) is an example of the two clauses functioning intonationally as a single
sentence. (3) illustrates both possibilities. Generally speaking, the shorter
the first clause, the more likely the second is to form an intonational unit
with it. Except in conditional constructions, changes in topic always result
in a new intonational unit:
            (4) kwäc ocako cem. apwo te nekke
                 L. 3s-start-perf eat-infin. H. 3s-and+then-hab
                   kill-infin-3s
                 'Leopard started to eat. Then Hare killed him'
te constructions may even begin new episodes in discourse provided the
narrative order is not disturbed (Sec. 10.2).
    te may be negated,
232                       The syntax of complex sentences            (5) loca obino paco pe te       ätin
                man 3s-come-perf home neg 3s-and+then-hab see-infin child
                'the man came home but didn't see the child'
and may occur with a time adverbial (provided it does not disturb the nar-
rative sequence):
            (6) i dikkomere gin ducu öte bind rwatte
                in morning-topic they all 3p-and + then-hab come-infin
                   meet-mid-infin
                'that morning they all came to meet'
te constructions can also occur in disjunction with         :
            (7) kä ötwo, ite dinno öjio ite öddo äoda
                if 3s-dry-perf, 2s-and+then-hab thresh-infin or
                   2s-and+then-hab pound-infm pound-ger
                'if it dries, you either thresh it or pound it'
In the above example, the second ite can be deleted.
    Serial constructions can be coded in narrative discourse with te; the
verbs in the series all appear in the infinitive:
            (1) te wot nwOQQO ojxrk
                3s-and+then-hab go-infin find-infin O.
                'then he went to find Ojuk'
With paratactic constructions, however, each clause must either occur in
a separate te construction,
            (2) te diiyo okelo, te kopjia ögwärj
                3s-and+then-hab press-infin O., 3s-and+then-hab
                   help-infin O.
                'and then he forced Okelo to help Ogwang'
or the first clause only is formed with te, the second clause taking the form
it usually would in a paratactic construction:
            (3) te diiyö okelo okopa ogwäq
                3s-and+then-hab press-infin O. 3s-help-perf O.
                'and then he forced Okelo to help Ogwang'
    Conjunction reduction in Lango can only result in conjoined NP's (Sec.
8.7.5). There is no rule of gapping or object reduction in Lango.","[244, 245, 246, 247, 248]"
"128. Ross 1967. Chet Creider has pointed out to me that other Nilotic lan-
guages do not obey the Complex NP Constraint. The crucial cases involve
sentences like the following,
            (1)   loca ökwälö gweno ame rwot öjwatö dako äme ötedö
                  man 3s-steal-perf chicken rel+part king 3s-hit-perf
                     woman rel+part 3s-cook-perf
                  'the man stole the chicken that the king hit the woman
                     who cooked'
which my informants rejected. I concede that their rejection of this sen-
tence may reflect the influence of English on my informants'judgements.
I have never recorded a sentence in free speech which violated the CNPC,
however.",[301]
"9. See Sec. 8.7.2 for a discussion of associative constructions. This, too,
seems to be historically just a case of cluster simplification. The modern
Lango attributive particle ä is a recent conflation of earlier pä
'associative' and ma 'adjectival', both recorded by Driberg and found still
in closely related Acholi. The geminated consonant may also be devoiced
— see Sec. 1.4.3.

'go', so that here, too, cluster simplification seems to have been at work,
with lyl patterning, as noted above, with the anterior consonants.","[284, 285]"
"
9.1.2 Coordination
Syndetic coordination, that is coordination involving an overt conjunction
such as English and, or, etc., is much less used in Lango than in English.
The words that translate English coordinating conjunctions either are, or
derive from, verbs. For instance, te 'and then' is a verb, is always con-
gujated in the habitual, and takes infinitive complements, όρο Or' is the
third person singular perfective of poo 'to be possible' and is also used as
a sentence adverbial meaning 'maybe, perhaps', (Sec. 8.11.5). And enta
'but' consists of έη, the third singular pronoun, and to, which is related to
te.115
    tc is clearly not syntactically a conjunction (Sec. 9.6), but όρο and ento,
whatever their origins, function as true conjunctions:
                  V   X   V   V   x       s
            / ι \  1 1  * ^ . ^ J ^ *
            (1)   okelo  otedo nrjo opo *acamo
                                           * *·
                  O. 3s-cook-perf meat or 3s-eat-perf
                  Okelo cooked the meat or he ate it'
            (2)   okelo otedo rino entS pe ocamo
                  O. 3s-cook-perf meat but neg 3s-eat-perf
                  Okelo cooked the meat but he didn't eat it'
The syntax of the two coordinated clauses is the same as that of the main
clauses.
    The use of όρο as a marker of disjunction is distinct from its use as a
sentence adverbial. Compare (1) and (2) below:
            (1) ogwarj odwako apwo cen όρο okelo oneko
                  O. 3s-bring+back-perf hare back or O. 3s-kill-perf
                  'either Ogwang brought the hare back or Okelo killed it'
            (2) ogwaq odw k           pwo cen. όρο okelo oneko
                  O. 3s-bring+back-perf hare back, maybe O. 3s-kill-perf
                  Ogwang brought the hare back. Maybe Okelo killed it'
    Structurally (1) represents a single conjoined sentence, and has an
intonation contour differentiating it from two sentences in sequence, as
in (2). In (1), there is no full stop after cen, όρο is lengthened and the
intonational contour rises through it to okelo where the normal downdrift
194                                     The syntax of complex sentencesintonation resumes. In (2), there is a full stop after cen and normal
downdrift intonation begins with     .","[209, 210]"
"     (2) The final consonant of a verbal root appears as a geminate in
     the transitive infinitive and in the progressive aspect, which histori-
     cally was built off the infinitive:
              /din/         'thresh'
                            [din»o] 'to thresh it'
                            [?ädin»ö] am threshing it'
                   cf
                            [Tadino] threshed it'
                            [di.n] 'thresh it!'
     The root final consonant in benefactive and ventive verb stems is
     also geminated.

         /rirj/     'run'
                    [?    · ] 'he ran to me'(3) In external sandhi, gemination occurs before:
   a) the final consonant of the head of an associative construction
   before the attributive particle /a/:9
         /buk # ä # däkö/ -> [buk- ä 'däkö]
         book att+part woman
         'the woman's book'
   b) the third person singular of the progressive aspect:
         /mon # a+ted+o/ -»· [mon· äted»ö]
         women 3s-cook-prog
         'the women is cooking it'
   cf    [mon otedo]
         women 3s-cook-perf
         'the women cooked it'
   (Plural nouns take 3s subject agreement.) Topicalized ele-
   ments, including subject pronouns, do not geminate before
   3s prog verbs:
         [ äted.ö]
         he 3s-cook-prog
         'he is cooking it'
   c) a set of words with so-called 'zero consonants' — the name,
   as well as the first description of the phenomenon, is from
   Tucker (1955). Like the attributive particle and the third sin-
   gular progressive prefix, these words were historically con-
   sonant initial, but have since lost these consonants. All agent
   nouns fall into this class as well as a number of other words. A
   sample follows — Acholi preserves the original consonants:
        Acholi      Lango
        /läpäc/     /äpäc/                'carpenter'
        /läbvör/    /äbwör/               'lion'
        /läco/      /ic5/                 'man'
        /lüdüku/    /ödüku/               'gun'
        /rübiä/     /obfä/                'money'
        /läwo'ro/   /äwo'ro/              'yesterday'
        /lätin/     /ätin/                'child'
14                                 Consonants            All Lango speakers I've consulted accept sentences like:
                 [man· oduxu]
                 this gun
                 'this is a gun'
            but some would say instead
                 [man odüxu]
            without gemination. Some of these words are more likely to
            condition gemination than others: generally, the more com-
            mon a word is, the more likely it is to exhibit the zero con-
            sonant phenomenon. Agent nouns (Sec. 5.2.2), because they
            form a coherent class, consistently condition zero consonant
            effects.
                These zero consonants have phonological effects other than
            conditioning gemination. They can block coalescence in exter-
            nal sandhi (Sec. 2.7) and they can block tone spreading rules
            (Sec. 4.4.2).","[28, 29, 30]"
"
9.9.2 Topic and cleft within embedded clauses
Topicalization may apply within an embedded clause, fronting an N P to
the beginning ofthat clause:
            (1) rwot neo ni ogwag okelo dägö
                   king 3s-know-hab comp O. O. 3s-hate-hab
                   'the king knows that Ogwang is hated by Okelo'
All types of true embedded clauses can have topics distinct from subjects
(topics underlined):
            (2) otoka ante rwot okelo omio
                   car rel+part king O. 3s-give-perf
                   'the car that the king was given by Okelo'
           (3) i kare rwot okelo owille, te dok
                   in time king O. 3s-buy-ben-perf-3s, 3s-and+then-hab
                      go+back-infin
                   'when Okelo bought it for the king, he went back'
Topicalization is not possible within infinitive phrases, nor is it possible
within the second clause of a paratactic or serial construction:
           (4)     ""'rwot ödio loca dako opömö
                   king 3s-press-perf man woman 3s-marry-perf
                   the king pressed the man, the woman he married
                   'the king forced the man to marry the woman'
    As usual, clefting is more restricted than topicalization. It can apply
within certain types of embedded clauses, e.g. complements to prepositional
240                        The syntax of complex sentencesattitude predicates and predicates of knowledge, as well as utterance
predicates:135
            (1) όρίό okobo ni okelo έηη ame* otogo mag
                  O. 3s-say-perf comp O. it rel+part 3s-cut-perf cane
                  Opio said that it's Okelo that cut the cane'
            (2)   rwot tamo ni okelo έηη ami okwalo gweno
                  king 3s-think-hab comp O. it rel+part 3s-steal-perf
                     chicken
                  'the king thinks that it's Okelo that stole the chicken'
            (3)    ge ni icok έηη ame rwot ocamo
                  ls-know-hab comp potato it rel+part king 3s-eat-perf
                  Ί know that it's the potato that the king ate'
Cleft is difficult or impossible elsewhere, e.g. in complements to desidera-
tive predicates,
            (1) *amxtto ni okelo έηη ante kw l gweno
                  ls-want-prog comp O. it rel+part 3s-steal-subj chicken
                  Ί want that it's Okelo that steal chicken'
or in relative clauses:
            (2)   *gweno ame okelo en ame okwalo
                  chicken re-part O. it rel+part 3s-steal-perf
                  'the chicken that it's Okelo that stole'
9.10 Subjects and topics In the section above, some coreference properties were described as
though they were properties of subjects. On closer examination, these
properties turn out to be properties of topics, and it is only because sub-
jects are likely to be topics that these coreference properties could infor-
 mally be attributed to them. 136
     The first of these is control of switch reference. As described in Sec.
9.3.2, the switch/non-switch reference morphology is used in hypotactic
complements to indicate whether the subject of the subordinate clause is
the same or different than the subject of the main clause:
            ( 1 ) d k okobbi loca ni ebino dok
                  woman 3s-say-ben-perf man comp 3s-come-hab
                     go+back-infin
                  'the womani told the man that shei will go back'
                                    i=i
                               Subjects and topics                       241            (2) däko okobbx loca ni binö d5k
                woman 3s-say-ben-perf man comp 3s-come-hab
                   go+back-infm
                'the womani told the man that shej will go back'
                                     i*j
In fact, topics, not subjects, preferentially control switch reference mor-
phology, as the following examples show:
            (1) loca däkö okobbe ni ebino dok
                man woman 3s-say-ben-perf-3s comp 3s-come-hab
                   go-fback-infin
                'the mani was told by the woman that hei will go back'
            (2) loca däkö okobbe ni binö dok
                man woman 3s-say-ben-perf-3s comp 3s-come-hab
                   go+back-infm
                'the mani was told by the woman that he/shej will go back'
The qualification 'preferentially' is necessary since if the topicalized NP
cannot be interpreted as coreferential with switch/non-switch morphology
(e.g. if it is first or second person), the subject can control coreference:
            (3) an ökelö ökobbä ni ebino dok
                I O. 3s-say-ben-perf-ls comp 3s-come-hab

                  was told by Okeloi that hei will go back'
            (4) an ökelö ökobbä ni binö dok
                I O. 3s-say-ben-perf-ls comp 3s-come-hab
                  go+back-infin
                  was told by Okeloi that hej will go back'
The second is control of coreference with floated quatifiers (Sec. 8.7.8).
This is also a property of topics, and a topicalized NP will be interpreted
as coreferential with a floated quantifier preferentially over the subject:
            (1) mon oöl kede gwoggi ducu
                women 3s-be + tired-hab with dogs all
                'the women are tired of all the dogs'
            (2) gwoggi ducu mon ool kedgi
                dogs all women 3s-be + tired-hab with-3p
                'all the dogs, the women are tired of them'
            (3) gwoggi mon ool ducu kedgi
                dogs women 3s-be+tired-hab all with-3p
                'all the dogs, the women are tired of them'
Again, if the topic cannot be interpreted as coreferential with the quan-
tifier (e.g. if it is unquantifiable, or morphologically singular), then the
242                        The syntax of complex sentencessubject controls coreference:
            (4) an mon ool ducu keda
                  I women 3s-be+tired-hab all with-Is
                  'me, all the women are tired of
9.11 Negative NP'sLango has no negative indefinite proforms like 'nothing', 'nowhere', etc.,
nor does it have a negative article like'no' as in 'no book*. In place of these,
Lango uses a complex construction with pe 'to not exist':
            (1) atinn äme öwotö gülu pe
                  child rel + part 3s-go-perf G. 3s-not+exist-hab
                  'no child has gone to Gulu'
            (2)   ginnoro am« äcämo pe
                  thing-indef rel+part ls-eat-perf 3s-not+exist-hab
                    ate nothing*
            (3)   rjattoro äme ocämo dekko pe
                  person-indef rel+part 3s-eat-perf stew-that
                    3s-not+exist-hab
                  'no one ate that stew'
9.12 Expression of adverbial notions9.12.1 Time and circumstanceCircumstantial expressions can be found either with a paratactic con-
struction,
            ( 1 ) ädok cen anworjo ätin
                   ls-go+back-perf back ls-find-perf child
                  'when I got back, I found the child'
or with a relative construction with kare 'time' as head:
            (2) i kare äme ädok cen, änworjö ätin
                  in time rel+part ls-go-back-perf, ls-find-perf child
                  'when I got back, I found the child'
    Expression of time before, time after, and simultaneity are found with
an otherwise unattested relative construction. Here, the time expression
                          Expression of adverbial notions                243
follows the main clause and is preceded by a relative particle ame. ame,
however, is not preceded by a relative head — this is the only instance of
a headless relative in Lango. In expressing time after, the verb in the ame
clause is inflected in the perfective aspect:
           (1) däkö olwokere ame ocemo
                 woman 3s-wash-mid-perf rel+part 3s-eat-perf
                 'the woman washed after she ate'
Simultaneity is expressed with the verb in the progressive aspect:
           (2)   icS ocemo ame ämätto k5go
                 man 3s-eat-perf rel+part 3s-drink-prog beer
                 'the man ate while drinking beer'
In expressing time before, the ame clause is negated and the negative par-
ticle is followed by ru·, 'ever, yet':
           (3) däkö ocemo ame pe nur olwokere
                 woman 3s-eat-perf rel + part neg yet 3s-wash-mid-perf
                 'the woman ate before she washed'
This construction may be preposed, but when it is, ame may not be present:
           (4) däkö pe ru· olwokere, ocemo
               woman neg yet 3s-wash-mid-perf, 3s-eat-perf
               'before the woman washed, she ate'
    Simultaneity can also be indicated with a paratactic construction. The
verbs are repeated and are usually found in the habitual aspect:
           ( 1 ) loce cemö moto cemö matö
                 man 3s-eat-hab 3s-drink-hab 3s-eat-hab 3s-drink hab
                 'the man ate and drank'
It may also be indicated by adjacent sentences in discourse where one sen-
tence, typically the second, is expressed in the progressive aspect:
           (2)   loca ocamo rirjo. amatto korp
                 man 3s-eat-perf meat. 3s-drink-prog beer
                 'the man ate meat, he was drinking beer'
   Temporal sequencing is discussed further in Sec. 10.2
9.12.2 Cause
Efficient cause can either be expressed via parataxis,
           (1) äryekäkwänö
                 ls-wise-hab ls-read-hab
                 'I'm wise because I read'
244                            The syntax of complex sentencesor by means of a subordinate clause with pi en 'because of it' acting as a
subordinating conjunction:
            (2) aryek pi en äkwänö
                ls-wise-hab because+of it ls-read-hab
                'I'm wise because I read'
Notice that pire is the usual third person singular form of pi 'because of.
kit 'way, manner' at the head of a relative clause can, in addition to its use
in expressing manner (Sec. 9.12.6), be used to express cause:
            (3) öwöt öyep cem kit ame totowa pe
                ld-go-subj Id-look+for-subj food way rel+part
                   mother-1 pa 3s-be+present-hab
                'let's go and look for food since our mothers aren't here'
9.12.3 SufficiencyStatements of sufficiency or insufficiency are formed with paratactic con-
structions with Tr rommo, AN rom 'to be sufficient' or Tr remmo, AN rein
'to be insufficient' as the second verb in the series:
            ( 1 ) en omiyä dek oroma
                  he 3s-give-perf-ls stew 3s-be+sufficient-perf-ls
                  'he gave me enough stew'
                 *
                    omiya dek re ma
                     S ___ A   *   J V *   V   V _   *
                 he 3s-give-perf-ls stew 3s-be + insufficient-perf-ls
                 'he didn't give me enough stew'
Since the paratactic construction requires that the subject of the second
clause be an argument of the first, activities can not be modified in this
way. When stating that an activity or action is sufficient or insufficient,
the verb must be nominalized and made the subject of romma or remmo:
            (3) kwanere orame
                read-infin-3sa 3s-be+sufficient-hab-3s
                'he reads enough'
9.12.4 PurposePurpose expressions are formed with the preposition me followed by either
infinitives or gerunds. An infinitive is used unless a noun coreferential to
the object of the verb in the purpose expression immediately precedes the
purpose expression, in which case the gerund is used:
                          Expression of adverbial notions                  245           ( 1 ) loca obino me canuno gweno
                 man 3s-come-perf for eat-infin chicken
                 'the man came to eat chicken'
           (2) däkö omäkö gweno me äcämä
                 woman 3s-catch-perf chicken for eat-ger-lsa
                 'the woman caught a chicken for me to eat'
           (3) däkö omäkö gweno me äcamänä
                 woman 3s-catch-perf chicken for eat-ger-lsa
                 'the woman caught a chicken for me to eat'
Gerunds can be interpreted as nominal modifiers, infinitives as adverbials.
Notice, however, that gerunds generally do not topicalize along with their
heads:
           (4)   gweno dakö omäkö me äcamänä
                 chicken woman 3s-catch-perf for eat-ger-lsa
                 'the chicken, the woman caught it for me to eat'
With infinitives only, me may be deleted:
           (5) kwäc olwrite i burj dwogo nekko tott a äpwö
                 L. 3s-sneak-mid-perf out forest come+back infin
                    kill-infin mother att+part H.
                 'leopard sneaked out of the forest to come back to kill
                    Hare's mother'
9.12.5 Consequence and result
Statements about consequence and result are often made with the paratac-
tic construction. In these cases, the second clause is interpreted as the
result or consequence of the first:
           (1) acemo tütwäl äcwe
                 ls-eat-hab very-much ls-become + fat-perf
                 I eat a lot, I'm fat
                   eat a lot so I'm fat'
           (2) omätö kdrp omer
                 3s-drink-perf beer 3s-become-l-drunk-perf
                 he drank beer, he got drunk
                 'he drank beer so he's drunk*
They may also be made with the relative particle ante followed by a verb
in the perfective aspect:
246                      The syntax of complex sentences           (3) o!5ko lok ami yie am£ ödök
               3s-change-perf word rel+part in belly-3sa rel+part
                 3s-go+back-perf
               'he changed his mind and (as a result) went back'
The first ams functions as the ordinary relative particle. The resultative
sense of the second ante probably results from a pragmatic inference from
the more basic 'time after' sense (Sec. 9.12.1).","[255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262]"

8.12 Sentence particlesIn this section I will discuss a miscellaneous collection of particles. I will
be concerned primarily with their syntactic properties. These particles can
be divided into four classes: preverbal particles, second position particles,
sentence final particles, and variable position particles.
     Preverbal particles include pwod 'still' and the negative particles
pe and mom. These particles precede the verb and may precede the sub-
ject as well, though if more than one is present, only one may precede
the subject. These particles may also be inflected for subject agreement
(Sec. 8.2.6).
    There are a number of particles that are almost invariably found after
the first stressed word of a simple sentence. These are the second position
particles and include ru· 'yet' (Sec. 8.11.7) and korj 'first of all':
            (1)   myerö korj item
                  3s-be +necessary first-of-all 2s-try-subj
                  'it's necessary for you to try'
            (2)   ikwäpö kor) kal
                  2s-pick+up-hab first-of-all millet
                  'first you get millet'
            (3)   okelo korj okwapo kweri
                  O. first-of-all 3s-pick+up hoe
                  Okelo first of all picked up a hoe'
    Sentence final particles include do 'friendly assurance' and bä 'please;
used in exclamations'. These particles almost always appear in sentence
final position:
                               Weather expressions                        187            (1)   kobbaba
                  2s-speak-ben-imper-ls please
                  'speak to me, please'
            (2)   gwoggi dago kono ba
                  dogs 3s-big-hab how excl
                  'how big the dogs are!'
            (3)   yin dok itie ikoko do?
                  you again 2s-be+present-hab 2s-cry-prog assurance
                  'you're crying again?'
    Variable position particles include the particle dag 'also' which follows
the syntactic unit put in focus:
            (1)   okelo dag ocern
                  O. also 3s-eat-perf
                  'also Okelo ate'
            (2)   okelo ocem dag
                  O. 3s-eat-perf also
                  Okelo ate also'
     The meaning is the determining factor in the syntax of these particles.
Preverbal and sentence second particles relate the sentence to other sen-
tences in discourse. Sentence final particles have a meaning which is pure-
ly sentence internal, and so do not serve to relate the sentence to other
sentences. They refer to the manner in which the content of the sentence
is to be interpreted by the hearer. Variable position particles focus or con-
trast individual words.
     There are some words that do not fit neatly into this classification.
The ubiquitous particle dog, translated variously as 'then', 'quite',
'already', 'anyway', etc. may occur either first in the sentence or follow-
ing the first accented word, as in the following example where it is both
sentence initial and follows the first accented word, gin 'they' in the sub-
ordinate clause:
            (1)   dog χ kare gin dog owoto bug
                  then in time rel-part they then 3p-go-perf forest
                  'by the time they went to the forest'
8.13 Weather expressionsWeather expressions are not impersonal in Lango. Rather, the subject
is either the name of the kind of precipitation, e.g. kot 'rain', ρε 'hail,
snow', or ikuna 'mist', or, in cases where the ambience is the reference,
the noun pip 'ground, world, weather'. For precipitation, the verb is
188                                     The syntax of simple sentencescwee 'to precipitate, swarm'; for sentences about the ambience, tie 'to
be present':
            (1)     ikuna acwee
                    mist 3s-precipitate-prog
                    'there's a mist'
           (2)      kot ocwee
                    rain 3s-precipitate-perf
                    'it rained'
           (3)      ρε ocwee
                    hail 3s-precipitate-perf
                    'it hailed'
           (4)      pijitie                 r c
                    weather 3s-be + present-hab att+part bad
                    'the weather's bad; it's a nasty day'
           (5)      pip tie dok a r c
                    weather 3s-be+present-hab 3s-become-prog att-part bad
                    'the weather's getting bad; it's getting nasty'
k5t 'rain' can also be used as the generic name for precipitation, allowing
constructions like the following:
                        ν
           / Λ* \   ϊ       ,Α   *·   ^ ν   ^     *
           (o)      kot ocwee ι ρε
                    rain 3s-precipitate-perf in hail
                    'it hailed'
8.14 The pro-predicateThe predicate pro-form is timmo 'to do, make'. This verb is used both
where the nature of the activity is unknown, as in interrogative sentences
where the activity is questioned,
           (1)      itimo rp?
                    2s-do-perf what
                    'what did you do?'
and in situations where the activity is known:
           (2)      itimo piijo?
                    2s-do-perf why
                    'why did you do it?'
           (3)      atimo me akka
                    ls-do-perf for reason
                    Ί did it on purpose'
                                Body-part imagery                      189timmo can refer only to active predicates. Despite the fact that timmo is
transitive, it can refer to both activity naming and secondary orientation
verbs.
    There is no pro-predicate for stative predicates.","[202, 203, 204, 205]"
"15. Actually, as pointed out in endnote 9, modern ä represents a confla-
tion of earlier pa and ma, both in form and function. Gemination and
devoicing are understandable before historic pä, the associative particle.
Gemination and voicing would be expected before the historic adjectival
particle ma, but in fact devoicing, not the expected voicing, occurs before
attributive adjectives:
           pig ä räc      -»·   pikk a räc           (not *pigg a räc)
           juice att+part 3s-bad-hab
           'bad juice'
            gwök ä räc    —*    gwokk ä räc          (not *gwogg a räc)
            dog att+part 3s-bad-hab
            'bad dog'
This attests the complete merger of the two forms.
    The loss of the initial consonant noted above is a regular feature of
Lango vis-ä-vis its relatives. A number of prepositions, particles, and noun
prefixes have lost such particles:
            Lango     Acholi
            ä         pa/mä         'attributive particle'
            i         ki            'in, about, with, to, from'
            ä-tin     lä-tin        'child'
Not all such words have lost their initial consonants, however:
            pi        pi            'according to'
            ka        ka            'if
The loss of these consonants has had a lingering effect on Lango phonol-
ogy. See Sec. 1.6 for discussion of the 'zero consonant' phenomenon.",[286]
"
1.4.2 IntervocalicMost Lango verb roots are of the form Ci(G)VC2 (Sec. 5.1.1). C2 can occur
word finally or intervocalically, in geminated or non-geminated form,
depending on which part of the verbal paradigm we consider:
                  /ted/    'cook'
                           [te«d]           'cook it!'
                           [Tatodo]         Ί cooked it'
                           [ted«o]          'to cook it'
    In Sec. 1.2.1, it was noted that [η] does not occur in environment C,
that is, it does not occur intervocalically except root initially — we find
no [q] corresponding to the [d] in [Tatedo] above. When the mor-
phophoneme /n/ is €2 and appears in non-geminated form in environment
C, the flanking vowels are nasalized and the /q/ itself is deleted:
                  /gen/    'prevent'
                           [g£»n]           'prevent it!'
                           [Tageo]          Ί prevented it'
                           [g£q»o]          'to prevent it'
Vowels are regularly nasalized before and after nasal stops, but the
nasalization in [7ageo] is more pronounced than the slight nasalization
in the corresponding vowels in [geq»o] or [g6«q].
    In nouns also, fully nasalized vowels alternate with [n]:
                  [cfq]       'hand'                t c ^f]        'hands'
                  [c5q]       'knee'                [coe]          'knees'
                  [n5q]       'crocodile'           [P^e]          'crocodiles'
                  [ty q]      'durra stalk'         [tyi>£]        'durra stalks'
     In nouns and verbs like those given above, there is little difficulty in
                          Other morphophonemic processes                              17positing a morphophoneme /rj/: / / is deleted in environment C when non-
geminate; the flanking vowels are fully nasalized.13 There are instances
of fully nasalized vowels, however, where there is no alternation with [ ]:
                            'morning sun'
                       ^ 'near'
                 [?og-£ra-]
                 [?ora""a-] 'sterile (of a young woman)'
In such cases, there is always a sequence of two nasal vowels, each of which
constitutes a separate syllable, i.e. there is always a sequence like:
                 V $V
In fact, fully nasal vowels do not occur in Lango except in V $ V pairs. It
is always possible, then, to posit a morphophonemic / / in such words,
catching a free-ride on the nasalization and -deletion rules. In mor-
phophonemic transcriptions, /rj/ will be written in such words:
                                /jiarjo/             /ögxrrjä/      /örärjä/

           rj-deletion          jiao                 ogiri          oraä
           other rules                                              [Toraä]
1.4.3 Devoicing and voicing assimilationNon-nasal stops and affricates assimilate in voicing to that of following
stops and affricates both across morpheme boundaries within words
(where gemination does not apply — Sec. 1.2.3) and across word boun-
daries:
           (1)   /yat + gi/         -*     [yadgf]
                 tree-Spa
                 'their tree'
                 /dog+ca/    ->            [doktpä]
                 mouth-yonder
                 'yonder mouth'           (2)                             gwfek/                [leb gwek]
                                           'gazelle'             'gazelle's tongue'
                                           two I/                [lep twol]
                                           'snake'               'snake's tongue'
                 /leb #
                 'tongue'                                        [leb m£dä]
                                           'swallow'             'swallow's tongue'
                                           romo/                 [leb 'romo]
                                           'sheep'               'sheep's tongue'
18                                Consonants            (3)                         gw£k/     -»·   [lag gwek]

                                        twöl/     -*    [läk twol]
                                        'snake'         'snake's teeth'
                  /läk #
                  'teeth'               mfcda/    ->    [lag m6'da]
                                        'swallow'       'swallow's teeth'
                                        romo/     -»    [lag romo]
                                        'sheep'         'sheep's teeth'
Syntactic environments which allow such an assimilation in external
sandhi in moderate tempo include:
                  (1) noun + modifier
                  (2) verb + object
                  (3) proposition + object
In slow deliberate speech no assimilation need take place in external
sandhi; in fast tempo, assimilation is possible in other syntactic environ-
ments.
    Word final non-nasal stops and affricates preceding the attributive
particle a are devoiced and, as noted in Sec. 1.2.3, geminated — the lat-
ter applying to all final consonants including nasals:
                  /pig ä däko/        ->          [pik. ä däxo]
                  juice att+part woman
                  'the woman's juice'
                  /bad ä däko/         -»         [bat· ä däxo]
                  leg att+part woman
                  'the woman's leg (of meat)'
           cf     /5t ä däko/           -*        [?5f ä däxo]
                  house att+part woman
                  'the woman's house'
                  /dül ä däkö/       ->           [dül· ä däxo]
                  log att+part woman
                  'the woman's log'
Historically the devoicing and gemination found with the attributive par-
ticle ä were simply regular instances of the general processes of voicing
assimilation and cluster simplification (gemination), ä was historically pä,
as recorded earlier in this century by Driberg (1923) and as it still is in
closely related Acholi.

1.4.4 The 0/y/c alternationA number of roots in Lango evidence a 0/y/c alternation:
        (a) opa-o                  (b) pa»y-o            (c) apac       päc
            'he carved it'             'to carve it'         'carver'   'carpentry'
            owe-o                      we*y-o               awec        owec
            'he swept it'              'to sweep it'        'sweeper'   'broom'
            owe-o
            V    V   V
                                       wey-o
            'he swept'                 'to sweep'
            wi-e                                            wie
            'my head' 16                                    'head'For these roots, C2 is realized as 0 in the (a) set, as /y/ in the (b) set, and
as /c/ in the (c) set. The generalizations governing this alternation are
these:
            (1) C2 is realized as /y/ in verbs otherwise requiring a
            geminate Cg, such as in the infinitive stem, in forms built off
            the infinitive stem like the progressive aspect, before the
            middle voice suffix -e, etc.","[32, 33, 34, 35]"
"72. Etymologically, it does not appear to be the attributive particle. Acholi,
which would have mä corresponding to Lango attributive a in these cases,
also has the a""- prefix before numerals, not ma.",[294]
"
2.8.3 Miscellaneous alternationsA few other alternations are attested. These are of minor significance,
affecting only single words:
           (1)    o/u 5t            'house'              üdi    'houses'
                  al/o kwallo       'to steal (tr)'      kwo    'to steal (intr)'
                  a/   cammo        'to eat (tr)'        cem    'to eat (intr)'
                  a/ye a-par        'ten'                pyer   'tens'
                                 3. StressPrimary stress in Lango is invariably placed on the root vowel (underlined
vowels are stressed):
                                                     Root
                  6d5         'she scoops'           3d
                              'meat'                 rig
                  äneni          saw you'
                  mxrmjr      'white man'            mv
                  münni       'white men'            nru-n
                  äbolö       'plaintain'            bol
                  otit        'fireny'               tit
Where the root is longer than one syllable — only possible in nouns —
the first vowel receives stress:
            (2)   makäc                 scissors
                  doggola              'door'
    Stressed vowels in Lango are somewhat louder and slightly longer than
unstressed vowels. The difference between stressed and unstressed vowels
is not as pronounced as in English; instead, the relation between them is
closer to that found in syllable timed languages such as Spanish.
    Particles (e.g. the attributive particle ä, the subordinator ni), preposi-
tions with noun objects, and certain prepositions following verbs are not
stressed. Instead, they cliticize to the adjacent stressed form:
            (3) okobonl          -^        okobbi            (with contraction
                3s-say-perf that                                and gemination)
                'he said that'
                  otedo pi        —>       oteddi            (with contraction
                  3s-cook-perf for                              and gemination)
                  'he cooked it for'
                  rino* a*>. abwor
                             *.
                                    —*     r<      äbwor     (with coalescence)
                  meat att+part lion
                  'the lion's meat'
                  bötdakö        ^         [böd»äxo]         (with voicing
                  to woman                                      assimilation)
                  'to the woman'
Except for the attributive particle, the vowels in these clitics do not con-
dition nor undergo vowel harmony.
    In reduplicated words, stress is placed on the last, unreduplicated
syllable:
                                    Stress                             43            (4) rärac               'sort of bad'
                tütwal \            ,    ,
                twätwal J               ^
    In borrowed words, stress is placed either on the same syllable as in
the source language,
            (5) m5t5ka              'car'
or, more commonly, on the penult:
            (6) gab me n te          'government'
                bulu                'blue'
In a few words ending in /!/, stress is placed on the last syllable:
            (7) daktal              'doctor'
                cukul               'school'
    In compounds and NP's consisting of inalienable associative construc-
tions, the root vowel of the rightmost word receives primary stress, the
root vowel of the other words receiving secondary stress (primary stress
is underlined once, secondary twice):
            (8) dogwtpo
                mouth bird
                'bird's mouth'
                pig abolo
                juice plaintain
                'plaintain juice'
                rg     yag mxirnv
                meat cow whiteman
                'European beef
                                 4. ToneLango is a tone language, exhibiting level tones, contour tones, and
downstep. In addition, there are a number of tone sandhi rules which may
have the effect of radically altering the underlying tonal contour of a word
in particular contexts.","[57, 58, 59, 60]"
"
2.8.2 Varying forms of the stem vowelAs noted in Sec. 2.5.2, the stem vowel -o has some harmonic irregularities:
it takes the form -o following the root vowels /o/ and /IT/, but appears as
                           Non-productive alternations                         41/ / elsewhere, even following the [-ATR] root vowels /a/, /i/, and / /. One
additional peculiarity of the form is that it may optionally appear as /u/
or l\fl:
           (1) teddo        teddu                 'to cook'
               rigo         riqu                  'meat'
The u/xr form of the stem vowel -o was not often encountered in the speech
of my informants (though all accepted forms like those above); some
speakers never produced them. The one exception to the latter generaliza-
tion occurred where the root vowel is /u/ or /\ff, in which case some verbs
in particular were habitually produced with the u/xr stem vowel:
           (2) guuru        'to drive in (e.g. a nail)'
                 mükkü      'to break off
                 nüürü      'to make drowsy'
                 cxrddxr    'to hunt'
Other, apparently similar, verbs seldom if ever appeared with u/xr:
           (2) kxrttä       'to blow on'
                            'to break'
                 tükko      'to play'
                 jxrkko     'to stop'
In these cases, information about the preferred form of the stem vowel
(otherwise predictable for verbs) will have to be lexical. However, all
nouns with u/xr root vowels favor the u/xr stem vowel. Some, like gulu'pot'
were rejected when pronounced *gulo; others, like ödüku 'gun' and
mxrnxir were accepted with o/o, and even pronounced that way spon-
taneously on occasion, but the u/xr form was preferred.
    See Sec. 5.1.2 for further discussion of the stem vowel.","[56, 57]"
