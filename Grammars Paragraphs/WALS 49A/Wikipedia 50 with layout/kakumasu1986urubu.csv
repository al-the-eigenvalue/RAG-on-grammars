"  There is no special form for expressing Or' coordination, but the idea can
be expressed in various ways, the principal one being by the use of nahä my
'perhaps' (cf. sect. 18.3):

9 Pragmatic and discourse characteristics
   There are two morphological markers for focus and emphasis: ke 'FOCUS or
OBJECT MARKER'; and riki 'EMPHASIS'. Both are postposed to the head
word or phrase which they highlight. There is no restriction as to the category
with which riki can occur. The morpheme ke normally follows a noun or noun
phrase, including pronouns and demonstratives, but there are a few examples in
my data where it follows a verb that constitutes a nominalized clause
functioning as object (see, for example, 106a).
   In transitive clauses where two nominals occur, one of them may be marked
with ke to indicate that the marked one is the object, that is the one to whom
the action is done. In many instances, the context or semantics may make it
clear as to who did what to whom. But there are occasions when it is not
clear and in such cases ke is used, functioning as an object marker:                                                             Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

"Nouns are divided into four sub-classes, based on the form of the third person
possessor prefix which occurs with each class: h-, /-, x- and Other'. Some h-
class nouns are:
        hamüi         'his grandfather'   hape        'his path'
        häi           'his teeth'         hapo        'its root'
        hembe         'his tongue'        hayty       'its nest'
The h- changes to r- when the possessor is first or second person or a free
form nominal; it changes to t- when the possessor is unspecified:                                                              Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

         tajahu ramüi        'wild pig's grandfather',
              cf. tamüi      '(someone's) grandfather'In a few cases, /- has come to function as the third person instead of A-:
         ta*yr        'his son' (not *Aa'yr), cf. ihe-ra*yr 'my son'
                                                  nde-ra^yr 'your son'In a few other cases, the form t- 'unspecified possessor' is not used; for
example:
         ma*e rapo            'some kind of root'         (never *tapo)
         ma*e rayty           'some kind of nest'         (never *tayty)  Some /- class nouns are:
         iäkä         'his head'             ijywa       'his arm'
         ipy          'his feet'             ipusu       'his stomach'
         ipy'a        'his liver'            itangwa     'his buttock'The /- is dropped and no prefix occurs when the possessor is first or second
person or a free form nominal:

         arapuha py'a               'deer's liver'   In the x- class of nouns, x- changes to k- when possessed by a non-third
person or when not possessed at all. That is, words in this class beginning
with k- may or may not be possessed. Thus, the x- class of nouns is less rigid
than the A- or - classes in this respect. See the following examples, where the
non-possessed form kyha is used in (234a) and (234b) and the possessed form
xyha in (234c):

"  The word tferehe consists of two morphemes: a*e '3' or 'that', which
usually has reference to the protasis, and rehe 'for, to', a postpositional
relator. In the protasis there are no restrictions as to the constituents that may
occur, so that the closure constituent may occur before a'erehe:
(229a)   hoi    ru         o-ho ym       a'e          ti

15    Noun phrase structure
15.1 Marking for case. The only element that might be considered a case
marker is the suffix ke, which marks the object in a transitive clause when two
nominals occur. See sects. 1.1 and 9 for a fuller description.

15.2 Genitives.     There are two ways to express possession. One is by using
possessive pronouns, which also (except for the third person forms) can
function as the free form subject in a clause. The second way is by a nominal
phrase:

18.4 Person and number.          Declarative clause verbs occur with the
following set of pronominal prefixes which agree in person and number with
the subject of the clause:
         a-         'ISC'     ja-      '1PL'
                                       4
         ere-       '2SG'     pe-       2PL'
         u-10-      '3'   The rules regarding third person forms are as follows. Verbs with
monosyllabic stems have the u- form, unless the stem has an o, in which case
the prefix is also o-. Polysyllabic stems have the zero variant. This latter group
includes all reflexive, reciprocal and causative verb forms. There are a few
irregular forms: i-xo (3-be) 'he is, he is moving'; o-u (3-be lying) 'he is in a
lying position'; we-rur (3-bring) 'he brings'; and i-hon (3-go) 'he went'. This
last form, hon 'go', only occurs with the third person subject (the form is ho
elsewhere). Some examples of each of the two classes of verb, based on the
form of the third person prefix, are:
                 M-                          zero
         uhyk     'he arrives'             matyr     'he gathers'
         uwyr     'he comes'                me'e     'he gives'
         ukwa     'he knows'               sosok     'he pounds'
         usak     'he sees'                jotok     'he takes out'  Examples of causative and reflexive forms are:
         mowok 'he causes to split'
         muhyk 'he causes to arrive'
         jumu'e 'he learns'   Stative verbs have only third person singular prefix forms. Where a first or
second person subject is semantically possible, free pronouns are used (sect.
16, and cf. the noun possessor prefixes in sect. 15.2). The third person
prefixes follow the same forms and patterns as the third person possessor
prefixes in nouns, being the basis for setting up four sub-classes of stative verb

xyha                'his hammock'            ihe kyha           'my hammock'

xamarar             'his friend'             ihe kamarar        'my friend'  The fourth sub-class of nouns is designated Other'. These are non-possessed
forms and constitute the largest number of nouns in the language. Some
examples are:
          Jtfl'fl           'forest'       jawar     'dog'
          awaxi             'corn'         akaju     'cashew'
          kupixa            'garden'       myra      'wood, tree'The only way to refer to these items as being possessed by someone is to use
a possessed form of the very general word ma'e 'thing', which belongs to the
i- class of (possessed) nouns:
          ihe-ma*e          'my thing, mine'
          ne-ma*e           'your thing, yours'
          i-ma'e            'his thing, his'Free form nominals may precede ma*e to indicate the possessor:
          kapitä ma*e               'captain's thing'
          mane ru ma*e              'Manuel's father's thing'  Examples of genitive phrases in sentences are:
(235a)    arauxu      miasu     ke      pukai           i-xo
          Araujo      servant   FOC 3+call              3-be

19 Adjective phrase structure
   Adjectives are stative verb roots and they occur in noun phrases as suffixes
attached to the head noun, thus forming a compound (see sect. 15.3).
20 Adverb phrase structure
  Adverbiale may be either postpositional phrases (see sect. 17) or adverb
phrases. Adverb phrases consist of a head word, the adverb, with the
possibility of additional postposed elements.","[70, 71]"
"  Nouns belonging to the h- and i- classes, and some members of the x- class,
are obligatorily possessed.
15.3 Modifiers.     Modifiers of nouns fall into two groups: those that precede
the noun (numerals, quantifiers, and demonstratives); and those that follow the
noun (either postposed elements or stative verb roots, which combine with the
noun to form a compound noun). Compare the following forms: stative verb
(236a), compound noun (236b), and stative verb with a full nominal subject
(236c):
(236a)    i-juk
          3-rotten             'It is rotten.'
(236b)    myra-juk
          wood-rotten          'rotten wood'
(236c)    myra i-juk
          wood 3-rotten        The wood is rotten.'",[47]
"Examples of more complex incorporations involving nouns and stative verbs
are:
(376a)    myra-py- pern                 (noun - noun - stative)
          tree- foot- flat
          'a flat tree trunk'
(376b)    ita-   pe- ra'yr              (noun - stative- stative)
          stone- flat- small
          'a small flat stone'
18.8 Auxiliary verb system.      The auxiliary verb follows the main verb
and, like the main verb, agrees in person and number with the subject of the
sentence. The forms which can be postposed to the verb (see sect. 18
introduction) occur following the main verb. Some of the more common
auxiliary verbs are:         rur    'bring';        jur    'come';    ho 'go';        and raho            'take'   There is also the special sub-class of auxiliaries, the aspect auxiliary, which
is described in sect. 18.2.
   Another type of auxiliary is the invariant form upa 'end, it is finished, that
is all'. In contrast with all other auxiliaries, upa always precedes the main
verb. In addition, it never occurs with first or second person pronouns or
prefixes (as it did in ancient Tupi-Guarani, cf. Anchieta 1876:55). It may be
separated from the main verb by other clause constituents:
(377)    upa aman u-kyr        rahä ja-     ho tipe
         end rain 3-fall       when 1PL- go FRUST
         'When it stopped raining, we went in vain.'",[70]
"The form pokok seems to be derived from ipo 'his fist' and kok 'touch'. I
have not found kok used elsewhere in the language as spoken today, but it is
reported at an earlier historical stage (Boudin 1966:207).
   There is one example of the compounding of a noun and a postpositional
relator: ha 'his hair' and ngi 'from' to form ham 'take off the hair' (there is
evidence in the language family for the morphophonemic change from ngi to
vw (cf. Bendor-Samuel 1972:140 and Boudin 1966:289):

"
   There are other nominalizers, but they occur infrequently. The form mi-/imi-
'thing', which is frequent in other Tupi-Guarani languages (e.g. Guajajara, per
Bendor-Samuel 1972:117), is found in only one Urubu word, possibly two:(278)    h-imi-   'u
         3-NOMLZR-eat               'his food'
(279)    arar  mi-   'u
         macaw NOMLZR-eat           'macaw's food'
(280)    h-imi-   jar
         3-NOMLZR-owner             'his hunt'
   In (280), jar is not a transitive verb and this casts some doubt on whether
imi- here has the same nominalizing function as in (278) and (279). In other
Tupi-Guarani languages, mi- is prefixed to transitive verbs and the resulting
form belongs to the h- class of nouns (Bendor-Samuel 1972:117).
  Another nominalizing form is -kwer, but this occurs very infrequently (it is
more productive in Guajajara, Bendor-Samuel 1972:122):(281)    janema'e       ke     katu-kwer            te          ta         'y
         our thing      FOC    good-NOMLZR          DMTNSF      PUT        now

         thus HSY 3PL
         ' ""Our things will really be good (things) now,"" thus they (said).'",[53]
"  Relative clauses occur in the form of nominalizations or descriptive clauses.
The latter do not have any formal marking of nominalization (see, for
example, (257)). Both types of construction may occur as subject or object or
in an adverbial phrase. See also sect. 15.4.

15.4 Nominalizations.         There are three basic forms of nominalizer: -ha,
-har, and me'e ke. The ke in me'e ke may be omitted, without any meaning
difference. The ke appears to be the same form as ke 'FOCUS', but in me'e
ke it does not function to mark focus or emphasis, at least in many cases.
Neither does it always have the object-marking function of ke.
  The forms -ha and me'e ke nominalize verbs, while -har nominalizes adverbs
and postpositional phrases. There are two other variants of ha: -a occurs after
the consonant k, and -iha occurs after other consonants. Some speakers use
-iha, rather than -<j, following k.
(261)    pe   mataru    mani'o   sosok-   a               ke pyhyk

         'Look along here in the opening.'

         thus freely end         3PL 3+move- NOMLZR 3-go
         'In that fashion all those moving left.'
(265)    petek-iha
         3 +hit-NOMLZR
         'thing with which to hit (something)'  As in (265), the -ha nominalization can have an instrumental meaning, but it
can also signify the action or process:
(266)    o-ho-ha
         3-go-NOMLZR
         'his going'The -ha form can also signify the doer of the action, as in (263).
  The me'e {ke) construction is the one more generally used for expressing the

"   Special rules apply to sequences of pronoun and numeral. When the numeral
follows a pronoun, it gives an 'exclusive' meaning to that pronoun. There are
no special forms of pronouns distinguishing 'exclusive' and 'inclusive', except
by this use of numerals (see sect. 16).",[49]
"   Object marking is not, however, the only function of ke. It can occur with
the subject nominal, of intransitive (137, 138) and transitive (139) clauses, and
it also occurs in postpositional phrases between the nominal and the
postpositional relator (140). As (139) shows, it may occur in a transitive clause
with both the subject and the object (cf. 13). I do not fully understand the
conditions under which ke is used to express these different functions, but
reactions of native speakers to its use with a single nominal in a transitive
clause consistently demonstrate that its function is then to distinguish the direct
object constituent. For the present, when it occurs with some other constituent,
I interpret its function as that of highlighting, and gloss it as 'FOCUS'.

          ISG-eat NEG I FOC               thing OM
             didn't eat a thing.'",[26]
"   Demonstrative pronouns take the form of nominalized adverbs: kome'e 'this
one' (ko 'this, here' and me'e 'NOMLZR') refers to someone or something
near the speaker; peme'e 'that one' (pe 'there' and me'e) refers to someone or
something some distance away from the speaker or near the addressee;
paiteme'e 'that one far away' (paite 'far away' and me'e); ame'e 'that one' (a-
'reference back' and me'e) refers to some aforementioned person or thing.
Demonstratives can occur as the head of a phrase, substituting for a noun, or
as a modifier of a head noun (see sect. 15.3):
(297)    amö       ta     riki   peme'e

1.1 Transitive clauses. I now consider SOV to be the basic word order in
the transitive clause, not OSV as in Kakumasu (1976). In the least marked
clauses which have both subject and object nominals, the most frequent order
is SOV. Clauses in which either the S or Ο nominal is a pronoun, or is
followed by ke OM^OC' or riki 'EMPH/FOC', are considered marked types,
but some of these are also SOV (see sect. 9, and exs. (4) and (5)). In a
corpus of over 3000 clauses, only 20 were unmarked transitive clauses,
including (1) - (3):
(1)    oropo    hu'y     pyhyk
       Oropo    3 +fever 3 +get
       'Oropo came down with fever.'

"10 Interrogatives
   There are basically three ways of marking sentences as interrogatives: (l)
phonologically - an interrogative sentence ends with high pitch accompanied by
strong stress on the final syllable of the sentence:
(152)    upa nde ere-mujä       tamüi

         you Xa'e      OM 2SG-kill           time past
         'Did you kill Xa'e?'(2) by using the particle my, which normally occurs sentence-final and seems
to carry with it the meaning 'perhaps'; it indicates that the speaker has no idea
as to the answer involved in the question (see also sect. 18.3):
(154)    ko      te'e            ta      nde ere-xo      ju-   pe

         you young boy PL for        much 2SG-be              perhaps
         'Why do you want young boys?'(3) by using question words. There are seven question words and they always
occur sentence-initial. Sentence-final my and mamy 'perhaps' may cooccur with
any of the seven words except the homophonous sentence-initial my 'where?'.
(!*my oho my 'Where did he go?' may be possible). The homophonous forms
perform two quite different functions as well as occurring in different positions
in the sentence:
(156)    my     o-ho
         where 3-go
         'Where did he go?'
         (Here my asks for information with regard to location).",[28]
"  The stative verb differs from the declarative verb in the form of the personal
pronoun prefix. One subset of stative verbs occurs only with third person
subject, and this is signalled by the prefix /'- (45). See sects. 15.3 and 18.4.
  Stative verbs of another subset have initial h- when the subject is third
person and initial r- when the subject is first or second person. See also sect.
18.4.

"   Historically, there is, in Tupi-Guarani, another form of negative, expressed
by infixing a verb to nd-...-i (Rodrigues 1953:151). A similar construction
occurs in Guajajara, where a preverbal form na- 'NEG' occurs with the suffix
-z (Bendor-Samuel 1972:85,94-95). In Urubu-Kaapor, only one (uninflected)
form has remained of this construction: nixoi 'there is none' (derived from
-ixo- '3 be' and n-...-i 'NEG').
13      Anaphora
   Two types of anaphora are dealt with in some detail in other parts of this
description: deleted elements (sect. 3), and pronominal forms (sects. 15.2; 16;
and 18.4). Here I will restrict my remarks to the special forms that occur as
sentence connectives.
   There are four basic forms that occur as sentence connectives with anaphoric
reference: a'engi 'from there', arah 'at that time', ame'e 'that one', and aja
'thus, like that'. Other elements sometimes occur before these words, but as a
general rule they occur sentence-initial. (For another connective, a'erehe, which
links two clauses in a reason-result relationship, see sect. 14).
   The connective a'engi 'from there' marks the continuation of a narrative with
a change of setting. It can be regarded as a paragraph boundary marker

indicating the beginning of a new sequence of events at a new location. It is
composed of two morphemes: a'e 'that one, 3', and -ngi 'from', which can be
suffixed to pronouns, nouns and adverbs:

         next when HSY there-from 3-go again
         The next day he travelled from there again, it is said.'","[33, 34]"
"   In ancient Tupi-Guarani (Anchieta 1876:12) and in Guajajara as it is spoken
today (Bendor-Samuel 1972:87,111), there are distinctive forms for inclusive
and exclusive first person pronouns. In Urubu-Kaapor the exclusive form and,
therefore, the distinction, have been lost, but there is a periphrastic way of
expressing the idea of exclusive first person (see sect. 15.3).
   First and second person free forms occur as the head constituent in
postpositional phrases; for third person, the pronominal possessor prefix is
attached to the postposition:
(289)    ajame'e ke jande pe pukäi             mä tl
         after that    us      to    3+call EXCLM again
         'After that they called to us again.'
(290)    ihe pe me'e       we       mi       amö
         me to 3+give little        very     some
         'He gave me a tiny piece.'

         wild pig     I     ISO-kill      thus I      3-to
         ' ""I killed a wild pig,"" thus I (said) to him.'",[55]
"  Sometimes my'y 'at the edge of has a prefix ry- attached to it. (In
Guajajara, there is a similar form which occurs in genitive constructions and is
considered a class marker in that language (Bendor-Samuel 1972:107)):
(314)    y        ry-my'y    rupi    jande    tame ja-         kekar

         'We hunted for crabs along the edge of the water.'",[59]
"   The particle riki 'EMPH' is stronger than ke when the latter is used with a
similar function. The best English translation for riki is often by means of a
cleft sentence, as seen in examples (140) - (143), although it should be noted
that riki does not always occur with the first constituent of the clause (see
144, 145):                                                            Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

                                   URUBU-KAAPOR                                       401   There are two degrees of nasalization of vowels: inherent nasalization and
light nasalization. Light nasalization is conditioned by nasal environments and
it may be progressive or regressive.
   Inherent nasalization refers to nasalized vowels which occur in oral
environments: ipö 'it is straight and narrow'; i'Vz 'his spirit'.
   Progressive nasalization occurs when oral vowels are preceded by the nasals
m or n. These nasals cause progressive nasalization of the vowel immediately
following them: uruma [ufu'ma] 'duck'. It is possible to hear a phonetic
difference (accentuated by using a tape recorder in reverse) between inherent
and progressive nasalization when the two types occur syllable finally. When
prenasalized stops [mb] and [nd] occur, progressive nasalization is blocked:
mono [mö'nö] or [mo""ndo] 'he sends'. Progressive nasalization also does not
occur following ng and ngw, since their most frequently occurring variants are
[rjg] and [rjg""7] respectively.
   Regressive nasalization occurs when a nasal (m, n, rj, or rjw), or an
inherently nasalized vowel, causes nasalization of the preceding vowel: aman
[ä""män] 'rain'. Regressive nasalization may extend further than a contiguous
syllable, but usage varies and I have not found it possible to arrive at any
definitive conclusions on how far it may extend or any conditioning factors.
(For a more complete description of this type of nasalization in Kaiwa, another
Tupi-Guarani language, see Harrison and Taylor 1971: 15).
   Word stress is of two kinds, and where it is relevant to the discussion it is
written as: primary stress "" and secondary stress +. Another type of stress,
heavy emphatic stress, relates to a whole phonological clause.
   Primary stress occurs on the final syllable of words: tata [ta'tta] 'fire'.
Secondary stress most commonly occurs on every second syllable counting
back from the primary stress: waruwa [+wafu*wa] 'glass, mirror'.
   Some postposed elements perturb the stress pattern. (These postpositions
should perhaps be regarded as suffixes, but in this description have been
written as separate particle-type words, see sect. 18). The primary stress moves
from the last syllable of the head word to the postposed element and secondary
stress occurs where the primary stress would otherwise be: nupä [nu'ppä] 'he
hits'; nupä ta [nu+pa""tta] 'he will hit'; nupäy ta [nu+pät""tta] 'he will not hit'.
Example of noun and postposed element is: myra [mipfa] 'tree'; myra ke
[mt + fa""kke] ""tree FOCUS"". Modifiers of nouns also perturb the stress pattern
in a similar way (see sect. 15.3): myrara^yr [mi + fafa* ""tr] 'small tree'.

  This is fully treated in other sections.","[75, 76]"
"In (332) ti is a final particle, not a postposed element in the verb phrase (see
sect. 21).
  There are three other words which I tentatively assign to the class of aspect
auxiliaries, although they function quite differently from those described above:
         indo     'direction away from'
         inom     'lying down position'
         ukwa     'passing by, falling'  They are not inflected for person, although the initial segments ι and u
express a relationship to the third person prefixal forms. They modify the
action of the main verb of the sentence, but the direction or position predicated
in the aspectual form is related directly to the object of the sentence when that
object refers to third person:                                                           Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

5    Passives
    Passive constructions do not occur.
6    Causatives
   Causatives are formed by adding the prefix mu- to intransitive verbs and to
some nouns. Only the semantics restricts causativization of lexical items in
these categories. The resulting form is a transitive verb, and the third person
pronominal prefixes always have a null realization (sect. 18.4):
(96a)     pe jande ja- hyk                ja- jur
          and we       IPL-arrive          IPL-come

         house center      1SG-CAUS -stand
            put up the house center pole.'",[16]
"  Indefinite pronouns are: amö 'another, someone, something', which can refer
to both animate and inanimate objects; awa 'person, one, who (interrogative)'-
when cooccurring with a negativized verb the meaning is 'no one'; ngä
'people, 3PL', which can be specific in its reference, but may also be used as
an indefinite pronoun. Examples of the use of these forms are:                                                             Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

7     Comparatives and equatives
7.1 Comparatives.        The simplest form of the comparative is one of the
suffixes we 'little' or te 'much', with or without katu 'good'. For example,
compare the two forms below:
         katu we 'somewhat good'
         katu te     'very good'
The antonyms of 'very good' are:
           katu   ym            'not good'
           katu   ym te         'absolutely not good'The constructions katu we and katu te may occur with verbs to express degree,
and the katu may be omitted:
           me'e   we               'he gave some'
           me'e   katu     we      'he gave somewhat good'
           me'e   katu             'he gave well'
           me'e   katu     te      'he really gave well'
           me'e   te               'he truly gave'  Another form of the comparative is an adverbial phrase with the basic idea
of direction upwards or downwards. For a higher degree the following form is
used:

"  A comprehension experiment was conducted to test basic word order. A
sentence such as 'John Bill killed' was supplied, and the native speaker
consultant was asked, ""Who died?"" The experiment was conducted with three
men, two in their late twenties and the third in his late thirties. Two men
caught on to what was being tested and their answers are given on the right in
the examples (19)-(22). The man in his thirties is a literate man who has had
experience in questions and answers and was one of the two who gave
answers. The other man who answered is an illiterate with no experience in
question and answer technique. The following sentences were given:

ke the one who was killed is very clear but without ke it is not. (The men
used the phrase ukwa ran 'he knows falsely' or One faintly understands').
  This experiment seems to substantiate the results of the statistical study that
SOV is the basic word order.
  The basic full order for a transitive clause is as follows:
        Connective Adjunct Subject Object Verb ClosureSubject, object, and verb are considered nuclear constituents, while connective,
adjunct, and closure are peripheral constituents. It is only rarely that all these
constituents actually occur in a single clause, the usual number being four or
five.

        again,   early morning
        'And today, early in the morning, Caetano went to look for turtle
        eggs.'","[4, 5]"
"    The form ukwa is homophonous with ukwa 'he knows', and may be
 something quite different from the other two forms described here. It appears
 to function as a fully inflected main verb with the meaning 'pass by': jande
ja-kwa (we IPL-pass) 'We will pass by (it).'
    Completed aspect is indicated by a particle that occurs at the end of a
 sentence: 'y indicates a completed action or state which was not in existence
 previously. In combination with to 'FUTURE' or ky 'FUTURE DEFINITE
PURPOSE', '>> may express action or state to be completed in the future. (See
 also sect. 21 for sentence final particles). As one example of the use of 'y,
 when a trade goods item had just run out, the following comment was made:
(336)    upa 'y
         end CMPL There is none now' or 'It has all gone now.'",[63]

                               21   PARTICLES
  There are two sub-classes of particles: medial and final. Medial particles
may be postposed to any constituent of the clause except the closure
constituent. They are distinguished from the postposed elements that carry
primary stress (sect. 22), and differ from postpositional relators (sect. 17) in
the functions they serve and the fact that they occur in any type of phrase:
noun, verb, adverb, or postpositional phrase. There are three medial particles:         je      'HEARSAY, it is said', indicating that the speaker was not an
                       eyewitness of the facts he narrates
         riki    'EMPHASIS, PROMINENCE'
         tiki    'AFFIRMATION' For the use of riki, see sect. 9. Examples of the use of the other two
medial particles are:
(385)    a'engi           je    o-ho ti
         from there       HSY 3-go again
         'It is said that he went on from there again.'

         'It is the one that tied me up.'
(389)    manö tiki
         3 +die AFF
         'He is dead.'","[71, 72]"
"   Reflexive pronouns are compound forms. They consist of a pronominal
possessor prefix (sect. 15.2), the reflexivizer ju- (sect. 4), and a postpositional
relator (sect. 17):
          i-ju-pe              'to himself
          ihe jupe             'to myself
         jande jupe            'to ourselves'
          i-ju-ehe             'for himself
          ihe juehe            'for myself
         jande juehe           'for ourselves'The reflexivized postpositions jupe and ijuehe may also be preceded by
nominals.
   There are no reciprocal pronouns as such, but the idea of reciprocity can be
expressed by prefixing the reflexivizer ju- to a verb and reduplicating the verb
stem. (Reduplication is also used to express iterativity, see sect. 18.2):
(303)    jang wate      ke      rehe     ju-              tuka-tuka     katu

         'He really bumped himself on the jaguar' or ""They really bumped

17 Adpositional phrase structure
  Only postpositions occur. They are the relator element in what I have called
a (postpositional) relator phrase. Members of the class of relators are:
         rehe        'at, to, for, about'
         rupi        'by, through, alongside, along'

they can also modify a noun in a noun phrase:

approximately 500 Indians in the northeast corner of Brazil. They live on the
tributaries of streams that flow into the rivers Gurupi, Maracac.ume, Paraua and
Turiacu in the state of Maranhäo. There are approximately ten villages
scattered from the river Gurupi to the river Turiac.u, an area covering some
2800 square miles.
   Urubu is the name by which the tribe is known to Brazilians. It is the
Portuguese word meaning 'buzzard'. In anthropological journals, the tribe is
often referred to as Urubu-Kaapor. The Indians refer to themselves as Aa'apor,
which means 'forest-dwellers'. In this paper they will be called Urubu-Kaapor.
   Until the early 1970's, the Urubu-Kaapor Indians were isolated from the
outside world. But in the early seventies, a highway was completed from
Belem to Säo Luis which passed close to villages near the Paraua river.
Because of the highway, the whole tribe has more contact than ever before
with the outside world and, as a result, bilingualism is increasing, especially
among the younger men. Before the highway, less than five per cent of the
people were bilingual.",[1]
"In addition, there were 22 SOV clauses containing first person free pronoun
subject, including:
(6)     ko    ihe paper pinim            a-   mu- wyr        nde pe

the relative order in which they occur. The table is extended to include
postposed elements that occur in the verb phrase. Some of these postposed
elements might better be regarded as suffixes, since they can perturb the stress
pattern of the main (verb) word (see sect. 22), but in this description they
have been treated as clitics or particles and written as separate words. All
these forms also occur in the stative verb (phrase). There is one other form,
wä 'a short while ago', which does not easily fit in to the table, since it does
not seem to cooccur with any of the other postposed forms:

18.2 Aspect. There are three types of aspect: aspect auxiliary; a particle
expressing completed action; and iterative aspect, which is expressed by
reduplication.
  The aspect auxiliaries are a sub-class of verb. They take the pronominal
prefix agreeing in number and person with the subject and with the person
marker on the main verb. They distinguish four basic body positions:
          -xo       'moving'            wata i-xo
                                        walk 3-move         'He is walking.'

The construction ijuehe har in (94), meaning literally One for
himself/themselves', carries the meaning 'about himself/themselves'; cf. ihe
r ehe har 'about myself.
   Although the form jupandu jupe 'he said to himself occurs, the preferred
construction is simply the direct quotation followed by pandu 'he said', without
the reflexive. The English verbs 'decide', 'wish', 'want' and 'think' are
expressed as direct speech followed by the quotation tag:
(95)     tuti      namö     nahä          o-ho   o-u- p      my          aja

          'Perhaps she went to sleep with Tuti, perhaps Xa'e
          thought thus.'","[15, 16]"
"There were 27 clauses containing third person plural subject. The word nga
'people' is often used with the meaning 'they', so this group of clauses was
separated from the group containing two nominals:
(17)    tapi'ir   nga     u-sa- sak   ta      tipe
        tapir     3PL 3-see-see       PUT FRUST

        and so      flu     3PL 3 +C AUS -arrive
        'And so they brought the flu.'",[4]
"   When the numeral precedes the pronoun, the sequence constitutes a stative
clause:
(255)    moköi jande
         two    we
         'We are two.'",[50]
"
                SYNTAX OF THE SENTENCE OR CLAUSE1 Word order
   I shall refer to three clause types in Urubu-Kaapor, distinguished by the type
of predicate they contain: declarative, stative, and equational. There is a subset
of verbs I shall call statives, differing from declarative verbs in that they do
not take the first and second person pronominal prefixes or the imperative
prefix. A clause having a stative verb as its predicate is a stative clause. A
clause with any other verbal predicate is a declarative clause. A clause with a
nominal or adverbial predicate is an equational clause. Declarative clauses may
be transitive or intransitive, these differing only in the obligatory absence of an
object in the intransitive clause. Table 1 shows the differing features among
the clause types.",[1]

"  Closely related to pe is pe riki 'then, and so, and it was that, but'. This
occurs less frequently than pe, but it also marks a sequence of events, being a
combination of the forms pe 'and' and riki 'EMPH'. It has slightly stronger
cause-result overtones than pe. For example, note the following consecutive
sentences:

As can be seen in (387) and (388), tiki occurs in clauses that do not have a
main verb with a function similar to the verb 'to be'.
  Final particles are so called because they normally occur in final position in
the clause or sentence, as the closure constituent. Only juxtaposed phrases may
follow them (see sect. 2). They also differ from medial particles in that they
are not postposed to any single clause constituent, but are related to the whole
clause. It is for this reason that I consider them a distinct clause constituent.
  The functions of these final particles vary greatly: ky 'FUT.DEF .PURP'
indicates intention mood; ti 'again, also' relates the proposition in the clause to
some other proposition; and kwe 'time past' gives a distinctive temporal
perspective to the content of the clause. Not every sentence has a final
particle. The full set of final particles known to me is as follows:         rf       'still, yet'
         ti       'again, also'
         ky       'PUT. DEF. PURP' (sect. 18.3)
         'y       'CMPL ACTION, now' (sect. 18.2)
         ky       'finally, now'
         kwe      'time past'
         mä       'EXCLM, SURPRISE'
         my, nahä, mamy, naha my 'UNCERT, perhaps' (sect. 18.3)Certain of these final particles may cooccur: |y may follow ky, ky and mä; ti
may follow ky and mä. Some examples of final particles in sentences are:
(390)    pay je'e          ym     we          ri
         Pay   3+speak NEG little             yet

   The orthographic symbols used in this description, and the sounds they
represent, are as follows: p [p], t [t], k [k], kw [kw], ' [*>], m [m], n [n], ng
[η], ngw [η""], s [s], χ [s], h [h], r [r], w [w], j [y], i [i], y [i], u [u], e [e],
a [a], and o [o]. Each of the oral vowels has a nasalized counterpart,
symbolized as: i, y, u, e, , and o.
   Consonantal variants and their conditioning factors are:
   The plosives p, t, k, kw, and ' are lengthened in primary stressed syllables
(in the examples that follow, primary stress is indicated by f immediately
preceding the syllable):          katu     [ka""ttu]       'it is good'
          Jta'a    [ka'^a]       'forest'
          akwa     [a'kkwa]       Ί know'There is a variant of p, [pw], which occurs before the high central vowel y:
py'a [p'V^a] 'liver'. There is also an optional voiced variant of p, [b], which
may occur in nonprimary stressed syllables: arapuha [arapu'ha] or [arabu'ha]
'deer'. There is an optional voiced variant of t, [d], which may occur in
nonprimary stressed syllables: heta tipe [he'ta tibe] or [he'ta dibe] or [he'ta
tipe] or [he'ta dipe] 'there are many, but in vain'. There is an optional voiced
variant of k, [g] or [g], which may occur at word boundaries (the plosive g
tends to occur in slower speech and the fricative g in faster speech): usak oho
[u'sak oho] or [u'sag oho] or [u*sag oho] 'he went to see'.
   The nasals m and n have prenasalized plosive variants, [mb] and [nd]
respectively, which fluctuate freely with the nasals before oral vowels or
nonnasal consonants. In normal speech, [mb] and [nd] occur infrequently and
in some texts not at all: moi [moi] or [mboi] 'snake'. In this description,
words have been written with the slow isolated speech form variants [mb] and
[nd]. The nasals ng [n] and ngw [rj""1] have optional variants [rjg] and [rjg1""]
respectively; [rjg] and [qgw] occur more frequently in normal speech; in fast
speech [rj] and [rj1""] may be heard: itangwa [ita'ng^a] or [ita'rj""^ 'his
buttocks'.
   The fricatives s and χ have optional variants [ts] and [ts] respectively. In
each case there seems to be free fluctuation, with the [t] in [ts] and [ts]
varying among speakers from lenis to very lenis: su'u [su""""u] or [tsul<>9u] 'he
bites'; ixa [i'sa] or [i'tsa] 'it is fat'.
   The liquid r has an optional trilled variant [f] which generally occurs
utterance finally: ja war uwyr [ya'war u'wtf] or [ya'waf u'wtf] 'the dog came'.
   The semivowel j has optional variants [n] and [dz]: [n] often fluctuates with
[y] preceding nasalized vowels or nasal consonants: erej n [ere'y n] or

                                                                           Download Date | 3/28/17 5:53 PM
400                              James Kakumasu[efe'nän] 'you run'; [dz] is lenis and fluctuates frequently with [y] before high
oral vowels i, y, and u; it sometimes occurs as the fricative [z] rather than the
affricate: ji [yi] or [dzi] or [zi] 'axe'.
   There are certain consonantal variants conditioned by features pertaining to a
contiguous syllable. A homorganic nasal occurs preceding a voiceless plosive
when that plosive occurs between nasalized vowels: hetü [hentu] 'he smells';
iäpü [iämpü] 'he is full (of food)'. The segment k is lightly labialized when
preceded by u. This labialization is lenis compared to that in kw: juka
[yu'kk^a] 'he kills'. The segments t, h, and n are slightly palatalized when
preceded by i: itawa [itwawa] 'it is yellow'; ihe [ih^e] T. When n is
articulated by its variant form [nd], the [nd] is not palatalized.
   A transitional sound approximating the semivowel [y] occurs between a high
front or central vowel and a low central vowel: iäkä [iyäkä] 'his head'; pyahu
[ptyahu] 'it is new'. A transitional sound approximating the semivowel [w]
occurs between back vowels and front or central vowels: jaxer [yaswer] 'it is
old/useless'; koi [kowi] 'tomorrow'.
   There are certain deletion processes. When the coda and onset of successive
syllables contain the same consonant, only one is articulated. When the
consonant is k, it is articulated as either a voiced fricative [g] or a voiced
plosive [g]: kutuk katu [kutu gatu] or [kutu gatu] 'she washes well'. The nasals
m and n are deleted preceding any onset consonant and the preceding vowel is
lightly nasalized: aman pe [arna pe] 'in the rain'. The consonants k and r are
deleted preceding any onset consonant: manilok jande japifok [mani'o yande
yapirok] 'we peeled manioc'.
   The deletion processes just described are sometimes replaced by an optional
alternative strategy of inserting a transitional vowel between the coda and onset
consonants of successive syllables. The quality of the vowel inserted depends
on the quality of the preceding vowel, according to the following rules:         transitional [ ] follows i and e: uker katu [uk^efcgatu]
                  'he sleeps well';
         transitional [e] follows y [t], a and o: muhyk raho
                 [muhik^faho] or [muhigsraho] 'he brought
                 it'; and
         transitional [u] follows u: mykur pandu [mikur""pandu] 'the
                 possum said'.","[73, 74, 75]"
"   The affirmative response particles listed at the end of sect. 10 occur also as
responses to imperatives and to declarative statements that express a mild form
of imperative (178):
(178 a)   pytun rahä jande ja- ho ta                apo

12   Negation
   Sentence negation is marked by the morpheme ym postposed to the verb.
The same form is used to express constituent negation and may be postposed
to a nominal or adverbial phrase:

"   In narrative texts, the numeral often occurs without a head noun in certain
restricted contexts, such as in (256). The deleted element is recoverable from
the semantics of the sentence or from the context generally:

""the more he eats the fatter he gets."" A semantically near equivalent would
be used, in the form of a conditional sentence with raha 'if, when' (see sect.

7.2 Equatives.      Equatives are expressed by saka 'like' or aja 'thus, like'.
Sometimes both forms are used: aja saka 'like that, thus'. The two forms may
also combine with the deictic ame'e 'that one' to form the expressions: ame'eja
saka 'like that one' or ame'eja 'like that, just like that'; or they may combine
with kome'e 'this one' to form: kome'eja saka 'like this one' or kome'eja 'like
this one':
(115a)   pe   riki  mair    mujä
         and so     Mair   3+make
         'And so Mair made (a feather headdress).'

14 Subordinate clauses
   One type of subordinate clause is formed by postposing the clitic rahä
'when, if to the verb. It may be preceded by other suffixes and postpositions,
but not usually more than two. Subordinate clause verbs do not differ in
structure from main clause verbs except for the addition of rahä, and the
absence of the closure constituent. Context determines whether the conditional
'if or the temporal 'when' is meant. When the negative ym and the future ta
cooccur, the meaning is unambiguously 'if (204, 205):(203)    a-   sak ehe         rahä a-        pandu ta
         ISO-see to him when 1SG- say                PUT
         'When (or, if) I see him, I will tell him.'(204)    ere-hendu ym        rahä a-       petek     ta
         2SG-hear     MEG if        ISO- hit         PUT
         'If you don't obey, I will hit (you).'(205)    aman ym         rahä a-      ho      ta
         rain MEG if            ISG-go        PUT
         'If it doesn't rain, I will go.'",[38]
"  The principal types of adverb are:
         time, e.g. tararno 'today, recent time'; yman 'ages ago';
            mukwehe 'sometime past'
         space, e.g. ko 'here'; kotete 'nearby'
         manner, e.g. pahar 'quickly'; wewe 'slowly'; täte 'almost'Numerals could also be regarded as a type of adverb when they occur without
their noun head (see sect. 15.3).
  The elements that can be postposed to adverbs in the adverb phrase include:
te 'DMTNSF', we 'short time', the postpositional relator rupi 'through', 'along'
(with space adverbs), jot 'right at that place'. Some examples, with and
without postposed elements, are:
(380)    tararno           te          u-hyk      u-wyr
         recent time       ENTNSF      3-arrive   3-come
         'He just arrived.'
(381)    kotete    ihe a-    ker    a-   jur
         nearby    I    ISG-sleep   ISG-come
           slept nearby coming home.'
(382)    ajame'e ke ko       rupi    ja-    ho aja ihe
         after that   here along 1PL- go thus I
         'After that, ""Let's go along here,"" thus I (said).'",[71]
