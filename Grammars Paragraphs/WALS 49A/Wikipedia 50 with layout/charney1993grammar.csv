at least one Coyote story begins thia way:

    Shoshone -pittsth (Comanche cognate:             —pits Vk [-pitst]). Miller
remarks that -pittsih genorally-applies to “fearsome beings.” In Comanche
it is found in that role on the namo for-a monster. I assume that this name
is to be analyzed as a single word: Mu=pitsT, [Muupits}]. When it is
translated—it usually is not—this word means ‘monster, bogayman’, Addi-
tionally, ~piteVh is used-as an intensifier with some adjective stems (see
section 6.2, as in a“fapitsVh [atavits] ‘outsider’ (a=ta-, ‘different, other’).
     Shoshone -mpiht (expected Comanche cognate: -“pih [-pl]). In Shesho-
ne, ‘the berry or fruit of the plant.’ Note that in Comanche the form doos
net begin with the fortis final feature. Words ending in -pih are found
occasionally, but the names for most fruits and berries are not cognate with
the Shoshone forms in -mpih, The first two examples below have Shoshone
cognates. The others-are given to demonstrate other types of names           for
fruit.
     pokoptt [pokop]] ‘fruit’ (SH pokom-mpih, “currant’)
     wookwepi [wookwevi] ‘cactus, peyote’ (SH wokai-pin, ‘cachus’)
     siikii (siikil] ‘plum’ (cf. CM and SH siki, ‘sour’)

     ndtsamukwe {ndtsamukwe) ‘grapes’
     4. In Shoshone this suffix is -ppt, The expected Comanche reflex for
this form would be -Hpi [hpi] and, in fact, Canonge (1958) gives the forms
for tenap: and wa?ipi as [tenahypi] and [wa7ihpi]. In my experiance this fh]
is seldom heard, and T assume that this absolutive suffix is in the process of
being reanalyzed as being parallel to -=pth. The remaining differences     are
in the shape of the two suffixes finally and in objective case: [pf) and [p.ha]
versus [pi] and [pi?a], respectively.
     4: See section g.1.4 for the use of ~n@= in the case of derived nouns, and
section 9.4 for the use of this suffix with sentential complements.
     5. Vowel-final English loans and names have -7a as their objective
suffix, with the exception of [hookl) hookih ‘pig’, which is [hookIha] in

ii?-benihtih-tsi ‘dear little brothers’, a term of endearment. This example
may reflect an earlier underlying form for -tsi of -Htsi,
    12, In the former sentence the consultant pronounces Lawton (Okla-
homa) as her elders did and in the latter, ss it is currently pronounced.
    13. Set numbers in the table are Miller's. He has-a total of six seta.
They nre, briefly (and generally—there are exceptions to each):           Set I:
locative postpositions used with intransitive verbs of rest. Set IT: locative
postpositions used with intransitive verbs, showing general diffuse loca-
titoni Set IV: locative postpositions used with intransitive verbs of motion,
to define the end point of the action. Set VI: locative postpositions used
with transitive verbs with the notion of ‘from there, right there’. The sets
not found {at least in their Shoshone shape) in Comanche are: Set Ih:
ending in -i, motion to or through, usually with intransitive varbs of mo-
tion; Sot V: ending in ~ti, defining the starting point of the motion, ‘from’.
As can be seen in the examples in this section, parts of this system remain,
but it is hardly intact.
     +4- Sic; Lwould expect pitt for ‘to arrive’,
     15. Note that the different directions are reinforced by the use of differ-
ent verbs.
     16, The aspiration in this form is not understood.
     17. The aspiration following tho reflexivo-reciprocal prefix is unex-
plained.
     48. The situation is much the same as in Shoshone, for which Miller
states that
    the force of the demonstratives is not as strong as in English, so
    that it is often best translated by the definite article ‘the’, When
     used without a noun, that is, as a noun substitute, it is best trans-
     lated by-a third person pronoun; the subject form semantically
     takes the place of the missing third person pronouns. [in press]
     1 translate such demonatratives as pronouns but gloss them as “this=
                   so forth in my morpheme-by-morpheme glosses to
one,” “that=ono,” and
signal their status as demonstratives.

     Pronoun stems are inflected for first, second, and third person;
 and for subjective, objective, and possessive case and singular, dual,
and plural number.* The pronominal forms that the postpositions
are attached to form yet another pronominal set.
     First person dual and plural have inclusive and exclusive forms.
The exclusive forms mark ‘we two’ ar ‘we all’ (but not the listener),
while the inclusive forms include the listener with the speaker.
     Third person pronouns are based on the demonstrative stems
(see section g.3). The pronouns i, 0, and u mark distance from the
speaker; the closest is i and the farthest is u. The unmarked pro-
noun for “he, she, it’ is u, with ma indicating a more impersonal
‘that person’, and so forth. Subjective ma is used in impersonal
sentences (section 8.2.3) and objective ma-~ is also used as an
indefinite object marker (seo section 5-2-5):Table 4.1. Subject Pronouns                 8G              bu                  PL

Comanche belongs to the Numic branch of the Uto-Aztecan
language family. It is spoken by a handful of people (generally aged
#0 and older), most of whom live in the vicinity of Lawton,
Oklahoma, This study is based on the model of descriptive grammar
developed by Mary Haas and her atudents at the University. of
California at Berkeley in the 19508 and 1960s. The phonology,
morphology, and syntax of the language are described and
exemplified in some detail. Comanche manifests the phonological
final features of most Numic languages, Its morphology is fairly
easy to identify, with little in the way of complex morphophonemics
beyond the final feature system. There is a wealth of affixation in
many areas of the ltanguage—for instance, the instrumental
prefixes, the postpositions, and the verbal suffixes. The pronominal
systems contain many      different forms,     and nominals and
pronominals are inflected for subjective, objective, and possessive
caso. The most important element of the sentence is usually marked

    T am grateful to a number of people and institutions for their
support and assistance in the completion of this project. The De-
partment of Linguistics and the Graduate School of the University
of Colorado at Boulder provided me with graduate fellowships for
the years 1981-82 and 1982-83. The Phillips Fund of the American
Philosophical Society awarded me a grant for fieldwork in 1981, and
the Center for the Study of the Native Languages of the Plains and
Southwest provided funds for travel and fieldwork in 1987. All this
assistance is greatefully acknowledged.
    My professors, particularly David 8. Rood and Allan R. Taylor,
have given unstintingly of their time and energy on this project and
throughout my education. Dorothea Kuschube first introduced me
to linguistics and also was involved in this project, as was Laurel
Watkins. Wick Miller has given time and consultation above and
beyond any reasonable expectations. John McLaughlin and James
Armagost have also been more than generous with assistance and
encouragement. John Koontz has been of enormous aid in matters
computer and otherwise.
     Douglas R. Parks has shepherded this manuscript through the
editorial process—a gencrally thankless task. I am also grateful to
Jon Dayley and Kenneth Hill, who made many helpful, perceptive,
and knowledgeable comments on an earlier version of this work.
    My family has suffered more than | can possibly know—thanks
to Michael, Jacob, Sasha, and Jared as well as to other members of
my family and to my friends.
    I thank the people I have met in Oklahoma who have shared
                  A Note on Transcription
     Tn this grammar of Comanche there are two types of transcrip-
tion: systematic phonetic and systematic phonemic ones. Phonetic
forms are given within brackets, phonemic forms in italics. (In the
examples, the element being discussed is usually in bold type.) The
systematic phonetic representation is essentially the transcription
used by Canonge in his Comanche Texts (1958) and is more acces-
sible to the nonspecialist than is the systematic phonemic repre-
sentation. For the specialist, a systematic phonemic level is helpful
because it can be difficult to discern the final featu
                                                     of a formre
                                                               if the
form is not followed by the “correct” stop consonant.
     English names are used in some of the examples in this work,
They should be read as they are pronounced by the people in south-
west Oklohoma; I have not attempted to represent these names
phonetically.
     The sequences [dy] and [gw] are retained in the phonetic tran-
scription because I have not discerned a principle that explains
their occurrence. If one exists, their presence should make that
principle casier to discover.

tury is southwest Oklahoma. In past centuries, before the advent of
the horse in the New World, the Comanches of the Plains and the
Shoshones of the Great Basin were one people, probably then
centered in the Wind River area of Wyoming and ranging through
the northern part of the Great Basin and westward into the Plateau
and eastward onto the northern Plains. Those early people are
termed Shoshones; Comanche is the name given in later years to
those Shoshones who moved onto the Plains. The carly Shoshone-
Comanche of the northern Plains-Plateau-Basin area were known
as the Snake Indians to such explorers as Lewis and Clark.
     We know that the Comanches had adopted the horse and had
begun to differentiate from the northern Shoshones by the late
16008, because they were observed in New Mexico by Europeans in
1705 (Shimkin 1940:21). From that date unti) their forced settle-
ment in the Texas Panhandle the Comanches’ history becomes bet-
ter:and better known from writings of Europeans (and, later, of non-
Indian Americans) of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. (See,
for instance, Richardson 1933; Wallace and Hoebel 1952; Kavanagh
n.d.)
        The people who would become the Comanches hold a command-
ing position in the history of the Great Plains. They ranged the
Plains widely, from Saskatchewan to deep into Mexico. Kavanagh
(n.d.) states that in the eighteenth century “the Comanche domi-

lost all but sporadic contact with the Shoshones of Wind River, Kay-
anagh (p.c.) believes the last important contact between individuals
of the two groups occurred before 1850.
     Today the languages spoken by the two groups, although quite
similar, are best thought of as two separate languages, rather than
as dialects of the same language. That statement is based on
observations of differences between the phonology and syntax of the
languages. (The reader can observe a number of the phonological
differences by a careful reading of chapter 2. Differences in syntax
are not addressed herein.) One important difference is that
Shoshone shows no evidence of the second-position phenomena
described in chapter 8.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
"    The comparative construction is a type of equative sentence.
When an individual or group of individuals is said to possess a qual-
ity in equal measure with another individual or group (i.c., X is as
good as Z) the construction usually has the shape: [X-tsa Z-wai-
]i/ku= Predicate]. Both nominals are in nominative case. The suf-
fix -wai is adverbial, meaning ‘like’, and -H/ku™ is probably the
 locative postposition ‘there, at’. The suffix -tsa has a predicative
 role in the presentative construction (section 9.4), and since it is
 present in most of the comparative constructions it may have a
 predicative role in this construction as well, G8)     [Susietsa Frankwaihku yuupi)

§.1.2.    Suppletion
      Many verbs are suppletive for number. In the only indication of
an ergative pattern in Comanche, intransitive verbs are suppletive
for singular versus plural subject, and transitive verbs are supple-
tive for singular versus plural object. This suppletion is common in
Numic, and speakers do not hesitate to supply the singular or plural
form of a suppletive verb when this information is requested, Exam-
ples of suppletive verbs are:(2)      [yaa / himij                       [kwe?ya / kweyu7i]
         yaa / himi                         kwe%ya / Ripeyu Pi

maintained when nominals are derived from these forma:{2)      [tirohtimapt / tirohtimi7ipfl

5.1.3. Auxiliary verbs
    Although in principle Comanche verbs may be freely combined
with other verbs (section 5.2.4), in actuality only a handful of verbs,
termed auxiliary verbs, are frequently combined with other verbs>
These forms take the full range of aspectual suffixes,
     Most auxiliary verbs oecur independently as well as with other
verbs, In some cases the meaning of the resultant form is changed,
and in some cases the two stems retain their separate meanings.
Examples of two auxiliary verbs, hani 'to do, make’ and naha ‘to be,
       are found in section 9.2.3.

      ‘Other common auxiliary verbs include mi%a ‘to go’, kati / yikwi
‘to sit’ (SG/PL SUBJ), and [-tai] ""to emerge’. Part of the range of
meaning of these verbs is exemplified below, using mia.(3)     [nomi?a]                         {nukimi?a]

5.1.4.    Instrumental verbs     Instrumental verbs generally do not oteur without an instru-
mental prefix (section 5.2.1), although in some cases the reflexive/
reciprocal prefix na- (or a semantically similar form, ni=-) occurs
instead. Many instrumental prefixes change the instrumental verbs
from intransitive to transitive; na- and ni=- do not affect the tran-
sitivity of the root, Instrumental verbs generally describe an activi-
ty that changes the physical state of an object, Most often the mean-
ing  of the resultant verb describes the action of the instrumental, In
the following examples, the verbs (-ku=pa [SG 08)]/tokwe [PL OB]
‘to fall’ and tama RETAIN) are given with a number of instrumental
prefixes, to demonstrate semantic range. Italic capital letters
indicate a gloss that I have created as a term to cover the range of
meanings of the various verb forms. A dash before a root: indicates
that the verb doesnot occur without an instrumental prefix or the
reflexive/reciprocal prefix na- or ni=-.

stH- is used for violent motion. For a situation such as kicking a

example (17) above, using toH-, is emphatic. Generally, tsaH- is
used with throwing. In the two examples that express translated

postposed with -ka, and -wekih is then added to the construction.
(The comparative construction is discussed in section 8.2.3.) I have
not otherwise identified this -ka,(1.71)   (Brandytas Tracykagwekl winniRt]

pronouns, and demonstratives. In some:cases a postposition occurs
on both a nominal and on pronominal referents to the noun that
occur in the same sentence. This construction, which is widespread
in Ute-Aztecan, is known as the copy pronoun construction (see
Langacker 1977b:27-28). These pronouns may either precede
(presumptive pronouns) or follow {resumptive pronouns) the
nominal, or do.both. The postposition may also occur on elements
that modify the noun. Although I cannot say definitely that any of
the postpositions must appear with a copy pronoun, this seems to be
the case with —H /nai and -nakwth. The use of copy pronouns is not
frequent. Restrictions as to which postpositions can occur in the
construction are not known.

    The element eis best glossed by the term ‘scattered’, lt refers to
a group of objects distributed within a field, When if occurs with the
locative element —pe, it has the extended meaning ‘other' (see Loca-
tive adverbs in section 7.2.1). Distance from the speaker is irrele-
vant with e. Distance from the speaker is also irrelevant with the
demonstrative ma, which is generally used with weather verbs and
ns the noncommittal “it” in predications such as “It is tall,” in which
the referent is unimportant or unknown (o-g., in elicitation). The
demonstrative ma is also used to mark the less important of two
third-person participants in an event (sce Armagost 1985).
     The vowel-initial demonstratives may optionally be preceded by
s~, Which indicates prior mention or the speaker's presumption of
the hearer’s prior knowledge of the referent.
    The stem o seems to be statistically the most common for the
nonimmediate demonstrative when not preceded by s-. When o-ti=
is topicalized with -tsa and the referent ia human, the form is often
heard.as [oretsa]. The most common stem for nonimmediate demon-
stratives with s- is u; u is also the most frequently encountered
third person pronominal form.
    The demonstratives may optionally be suffixed with -t:=, which
is homophonous with the suffixes used to mark generic aspect and
so on {see, for instance, section g.1.5). The demonstratives are in-
flected for singular, dual, and plural number and for subjective,

meanings,
     14. MéLaughlin (298ga) contains an excellent discussion of these two

sive aspect is called for) as the progressive marker on verbs of speaking.

                                   6                     NOUN MODIFIERS    Nouns may be modified by a wide range of elements. These
include, along with the demonstratives, a few morphemes that are
true modifiers and many that are derived from nouns and verbs,
(Because these elements modify verbs as well as nouns they are
termed modifiers rather than adjectives or adverbs.) Other modifi-
ers include color terms, numerals, and quantifiers, all of which are
described below.
     The modifier precedes the noun it modifies and may optionally
occur with no morphology of its own. When it is uninflected, though
the modifier and noun are both stressed, second-position elements
(section 8.2.2) do not occur between them. For that reason, and due
to the lack of morphology on the modifier, I consider the modifier to
be compounded with the noun and write the combination as one
word,
    A variety of morphological devices occur with modifiers when
they are not incorporated. Many modifiers may be suffixed with —ti*
and can then be inflected to agree with the modified noun in num-
ber (singular, dual, plural) and case (subjective; objective, posses-
sive): | assume that -t= is related to the predicative suffix -tt= (see
section 8.2.9).
      Predicate adjectives are usually suffixed with -ti* or -yu= (sec-
tion 8.2.9). In citation form the modifiers are found with a number
of different: endings, including emphatic suffixes such as —pitst ~
-pitsih' and ~titsi, the nominalizing -=pih, and the suffixes -tt=

noun, are almost always compounded with it. I term them true
modifiers. In citation form, some are followed by emphatic suffixes
such as -pitsi ~ —pitsi and some are not. The ones that are suffixed
with the emphatic suffixes are not followed by the predicative -ti=,
and I am unaware of any that are suffixed by the absolutive-
nominalizing suffix -=pih, Examples of underived (or true)
modifiers include iki- ‘new’, a=ta-/at*i ‘other, different’, tie-

     I have several other instances of variation between h and ?. For
instance, for ‘persimmon’ Canonge has [na?sééka] and I have
[nahseeka] (note that my form has first-syllable stress). For ‘cheek’
T have both [soho] and {s07o] (cf. Shoshone sohoh=peh). Canonge has
a final glottal which is analyzed as o nominalizing suffix (Osborn
and Smalley 1949, Armagost 1980). This final glottal does not
appear in my data, but many lexical items have long final vowels
and are, in objective case, suffixed with the objective marker [-?a].
The objective form of those nouns is evidence for the persistence of a
final glottal. However, vowel-final English loans are ended by [-?a]
in objective case—a pattern that argues for reanalysis of the auffix.
(Discussion and examples of the objective case are found in section
3-1-4.) A final ? is also found in Canonge after first person singular
subject ({ni?]). I have vowel length and strong stresson this pro-
noun ({nit)), with only a rare trace of a final glottal stop-2.2.     Streas     Most Comanche words are stressed on the first syllable, but
there are some important exceptions. Primary stress is always
marked in this work when it is noninitial. Many instances of
noninitial stress are explainable synchronically or diachronically;
some are not. Possessive and objective pronouns and the indefinite
subject prefix ta=- are enclitic to verb and noun stems. That is,
stress does not move leftward to these elements. When a pronounis

2.2.1.   Noninitial strees     Noninitial stress occurs when a syllable other than the first
syllable of the word receives primary stress: Noninitial stress may
be found on any syllable of the word, and may or may not co-occur
with initial stress. The initial syllable never weakens to the point of
voicelessness.
    Leans are a common source of words with noninitial stress:         {wasipe]         wasd=pe       bear              (Osage wasape)""*
         {pirisii]       pitisii        policeman         (English policeman)
         [pihira}         piluita       bean, beans       (Spanish frijoles)Some forms have two stresses:         {anikura]           aniiulta               ant (analysis unknown)
         (nfivukuwéd})        na-puku-waa           car (RFLX-horse-without)

this is:     [wokoré?ex]     wakaté?ee          turtle      (analysis unknown)

2.2.2.    Alternating stress
     In words of three or more syllables, alternating stress may be
present, In words with stress on the initial syllable, a secondary
stress is placed on every second mora rightward. The following ex-
ample demonstrates straightforward mora counting:         [wahatimato7ikatf]     waha--??   twelve       (two-??)    The following forms demonstrate problems with a vowel cluster.
In both cases the predicative suffix -?ai ‘to do, make, is a part of the
word. Inthe compound for ‘spider web’ this element seems to count
as one mora, and in the form for ‘soup’ it seems to count as two
moras. Recall that the pronominal object does not receive a stress,         [pfhirétsiwanaaips)

forward manner. However, there are also forms, such as the follow-
ing, in which -/a=(2) seems to pull primary stress rightward one
mora (‘(what) will happen?’) (see section 2.2.3, below) or to behave
in a manner similar to -hu=(2) (‘expected to see them’). Clearly,
further exploration of this suffix is called for,    [nabahutu?i}          naha-hu=(2)-tu %        (what) will happen?

      1. This chapter owes an enormous debt to Wick Miller; who has given
generously of his time and knowledge to help unravel the intricacies of
Comanche phonology. [ have also benofitted greatly from the work of Jim
Armagost, who has spent much time and energy working out the problems
of Comanche voiceless vowels. John Mclaughlin has given me valuable
criticism on an earlier version of this chapter. The first chapter of his

form terminated in -x indicates that the final feature of the stem or mor-
pheme is undetermined,
     4. Canonge transcribos this form as na?Aruu-/h.
     §- Miller (in press) states that in Shoshone most examples of [hw] are
variants of [hm). In Comanche, there is no evidence of that relutionship,
     6. Riggs notes that, “In intervocalic position w and y haye idiolectal
variants gw and dz respectively” (ag49:229).
     7. Interestingly, the form for the cognate morpheme in Shoshone is
kopai, In Shoshone e and ai frequently occur as variants of one another. I
have not discovered phonetic interchanges between e and ai in Comanche
except for the postposition ‘around’, which occurs variously as [-hoiktf],
[-hoaik?], nnd {-hoekf).
     8. The vowel sequences are almost the same as the vowel soquonces of
Shoshone. Miller (in press) also reports the sequence ea, which I have not
encountered, although McLaughlin (p.c.) has discovered the form (nahweai]

format as‘a type of shorthand notation; they do not represent adherence to
a school of thought.
     10. Although this section deals with final features within the verb
system, three postpositions (-H/pu=, -H/tu-, and -H/ku=) demonstrate 4
contrast between the preaspirated and lenis-fortis final features in some
contexts, In addition, the absolutive suffix’ -=pth, which is also used as a
nominalizing suffix, has the fortis final feature as the first cloment of the
morpheme,

with an absolutive suffix when they are not a member of a com-

postpositions is used to express a number of locative and other
adverbial notions. A number of suffixes are used to nominalize

Introduction                                                       3     Canonge (1957) argues for the phonemic status of some of the
voiceless vowels of the language. His article initiated a debate be-
tween himself and Roman Jacobson about the nature of those voice-
less vowels that resulted in Comanche voiceless vowels being well
known in the linguistics literature. The debate ia discussed briefly
in chapter 2.
     Osborn and Smalley (1949) is an excellent, but brief, prelimi-
nary analysis of the morphemes of the language. The other short
article on the language from that era (Smalley 1953) discusses pho-
nemic rhythm in Comanche, but is hard to follow, as the analysis
seems to rely heavily on tape-recorded material, thus missing final
and medial voiceless vowels.
    Among the larger works from that era are Canonge's Comanche
Texts (1958), an outstanding collection of folktales and personal
anecdotes that includes a Comanche-English morpheme list, and
Casagrande's masterful study of loanworda in Comanche (19544,
19546, 1955).
     More recently, Comanche has been studied by James Armagost,
John McLaughlin, Lila Wistrand Robinson, and myself. Armagost
(1980) is a grammar of Comanche taken primarily from Canonge's
texts; it is a preliminary version of the grammar in Robinson and
Armagost (1990). Armagoat (1979, 19828, 1982b, 1983, 1984, 19858)
examines the ways in which morphology and syntax conspire to
reference participants in Comanche narrative. Armagost (a985b,
1986, 1987, 19884, 1988b) also explores the phenomenon of Coman-
che voiceless vowels. Armagost and Miller (n.d.) is an examination
of the problem using material from Comanche and Shoshone, Most
of the references to McLaughlin in this book (McLaughlin 1982,
1982b, 198ga, 198gb, 1983¢, 1984) are studies of Central Numic
                                                       ly affixes) of
4                                                 COMANCHE GRAMMARences by Miller (1970) and Crum (2980) are helpful in understand-
ing Shoshone dialects and poetry, respectively.
    In the realm of Numic studies, Booth (1979) and Munro (1974,
1976) tackle problems that exist in Comanche (though their studies
are not primarily directed toward Comanche), and both are excel-
lent models for doing work on problems in Numic languages. The
first chapter of McLaughlin (1987) and of Nichols (1974) are guides
through the maze of literature on and problems in the Numic final-
feature system. Sapir (2930-31) establishes the concept of final fen-
tures; his work is also invaluable as a description of a Numic lan-
guage.
     Works on Uto-Aztecan used in this book include Langacker’s
overview of Uto-Aztecan (19774), as well as his studies of nondis-
tinct argument phenomena (1978) and postpositions in the language
(19776). Steele (1973) describes second-position phenomena and
general modality in the language family. Crapo (1970) examines
main and subordinate verbs in Uto-Aztecan.
     Material for this book was gathered in 1981, 1983, 1985, and
1987 from work with Mrs. Lucille McClung of Cache, Oklahoma.
Some work was conducted in Oklahoma and some in Colorado,
Other material was furnished to me by Mrs. Agnes Wermy and Mrs.
Theresa Saupitty, also of Cache: I have concentrated on material
from those speakers rather than the data found in Canonge’s texts
because I have been working with data from a period some forty
years later than that Canonge describes, There are few Comanche
speakers under the age of seventy.","[15, 16, 17]"

The terms are Sapir’s (1930-31), and are used by Miller (in press);
other writers (e.g., Nichols 1974) use the terms lenis and fortis for
spirantizing and geminating. Sapir hypothesizes that the spir-
antizing, geminating, and nasalizing effects are an integral part of
a morpheme, He writes the above stems as: anka*, kuttsa®, pai"";
the superscript letter indicates the “inner form” of the morpheme
(agg0-31:63).
    It is now hypothesized that the element that determines the
shape of the consonant of a following root or morpheme is a feature
that, in the case of geminating and nasalizing, is the final element
of the preceding morpheme, and that when a following consonant is
spirantized (or lenis), the preceding morpheme simply ends in a
vowel. Final features are present underlyingly in morpheme-final
position and affect immediately following stops and nasals. Analo-
gous phenomena are present within morphemes; it is assumed that
similar processes are at work because the same kinds of allophones
are found in both cases, and because one finds Shoshone cognates
that demonstrate the phenomenon morpheme-internally, as in the
examples below.
    Miller (n.d.a) convincingly demonstrates that the Shoshone sys-
12                                                   COMANCHE       GRAMMARvoiceless, so that, for instance, [vpp] became [Vpp]. Once the vowel
was voiceless it preaspirated the stop so that [Vpp] (voiceless vowel-
géminated stop) became [Vhp] (voiceless vowel-preaspirated conso-
nant); Jater the stop became a voiceless spirant, so that [Vhp] be-
came [Vo] (voiceless vowel-voiceless spirant).
     Examples of Shoshone final features using -pa?i - -pat ‘to have’
from Miller (n.d.b):
      [tso?o—va?i]      to have great-grandparents     spirantizing
      [tivap-pa7i}      to have pine nuts              geminating
      [tscom-ba7i]}     to have beads                  nasalizing
      [hai-dai]         to have a crow                 preaspirating     Comanche also has a four-way system, but with important
changes from Shoshone. Miller (n.d.a) shows that Comanche has
changed from Shoshone in the ways described in the following four
paragraphs. (The change from spirantized to voiceless stop is con-
troversial. I refer the reader to Miller {n.d.a) and to McLaughlin [in
press] for discussion of this matter.) The dropping of the nasal stoy
series has occurred in a number of Numic languages (Mono, Oregon
Northern Paiute, Bannock, Nevada Northern Paiute, Kawaiisu, and
Ute), although the resulting stops vary from language to language
(McLaughlin, in press). The examples below are generally Miller's
forms; my data agree, For expository purposes, these examples are
morpheme-internal. Examples at morpheme boundaries (for Co-
manche) are found under the various consonants in the following
section.
     Comanche has despirantized the nonanterior stops and the af-
fricate, so that lenis forms of the stops only occur with p following
any vowel and with ¢ after all vowels but i and e ts, & and kw do

netically as voiceless fricatives. The latter correspond to Comanche
voiceless fricatives.","[22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"3.1. Nominal   roots     The nominal! root is the form of the noun without affixes—for
 instance, as the root is when compounded, The various elements
that may be attached to the root are discussed below.
     Some nouns may be inalienably possessed. Such nouns are
 names for body parts, kin terms, and the word for a possessed horse
 (puku). This area of Comanche morphology is difficult to ascertain,
 as the speakers I have worked with are able to produce words with-
‘out possessive morphology during elicitation sessions. However, the
 above terms are always found with possessive pronouns in texts.
     Joseph Casagrande relates one way in which new nouns are
 created in Comanche:    Especially noteworthy in Comanche is a well-defined pattern of
    synonymous animal terms which figure prominently in stories,
    myths and songs...   . animal names were frequently used in Co-

found with an ending traditionally termed an absolutive suffix.*
The function of the absolutive may have originally been to classify
nouns, but in Comanche any rationale the system once may have
had is now lost, and no semantic (or other) criteria explain which
absolutive suffix, if any, appears with a particular noun. The suffix
is usually present when the noun occurs in isolation and when it is
topicalized with -tsa or -se. It is dropped when the noun
                                                        is the first
member of a compound, followed by a postposition, or incorporated.            |
The productive absolutive endings in Comanche are:*                           }                 —=pth         (objective [-pha))

(section 3.1.5) and is occasionally used with predicative force (sec-     |

describing natural phenomena (but not very often with animal
names), body parts, and other items that occur in nature,                 |                                 —=pih

of the subject relative is: [SUBJ(-tsa) [REL=CL{-tsa)] MAIN=VERB]

subject and object of the clause are in possessive case and the verb
of the clause is nominalized. As is discussed in section 9.1.4,
possessive case is usually marked with the fortis final feature on
the objective form of the noun or pronoun. The demonstrative
objects in the sentences which exemplify object relatives, such as
uHka, in (73) above, are generally indeterminate for final feature,
as they are followed by second-position subject pronouns, and those
pronouns do not beginin p or t, However, in a sentence such as (76)
below, the pronoun is objective. Therefore I analyze the demon-
stratives as objectives (i.c., I believe they are the object of the main
verb), Example (75) may be counterevidence; the initial fortis
consonant of tena=pi in that sentence might be the result of slow
speech or it may demonstrate that sometimes the object is in
possessive case, and thus in the lower sentence. The subject of the
relative clause can be followed by forms that begin in p or ¢, as in
‘cow’ in examples (73) and (74); note that the stop is fortis. The
relationship of the objective pronoun and the subject of the relative

4.7. Interrogative/ indefinite pronoun inflection      A large group of interrogative/indefinite pronouns is inflected.
The members of this group all have as their base ha- or /i-. The
stems that are inflected are haka- ‘who’; hint= ‘what’, ‘something’,
‘someone’; hit ‘some’, ‘how much’; hitpe ‘when’, ‘how much’; hakah
‘where’; and Aakani ‘why', ‘because of. The forms hakai ‘how’
(state of being) and hakaniyu=ti= ‘why’ are not inflected, The ele-
ment ~pe found with hi=pe.also occurs with the extent adverbs (sec-
tion 7.1.1). The postposition -H/pu=, which is suffixed to hakah
‘where’, also occurs with the locative adverbs (section 7.1.1). The
adverbial suffix -ni of hakani ‘why’ also occurs with the manner
adverbs (section 7.1.1).
    The human interrogative/indefinite pronoun jake- ts inflected
for singular, dual, and plural number and for ‘subject, object, and
possessive case, and for object of a postposition. Most other inter-
rogative/indefinite pronouns aré inflected for subjective-objective
case and singular-plural number only. These pronouns are used as:
interrogatives far more frequently than as indefinites, Examples of
interrogative usage are found in section 8.2.4.         ldo not have
examples of indefinite usage of hi=pekai and hakaniyu=t-.
    Other indefinites include forms such as simi ‘one, someone’ (see
section 6.4.1); kehe- ‘nobody’; u?ahti [u’ahri] ‘anybody’, ke...

       1. This section is largely based on the work of Armagost, particularly
(1984). Many of his other papors also explore the workings of the third
porson/demonstrative system, and the reador is referred to these, The
                                      5                                “VERBS     A number of verb stems are regularly suppletive. Intransitive
verbs are suppletive for singular versus plural subject and transi-
tive verbs are suppletive for singular versus plural object. Non-
suppletive verbs are optionally marked for number. The verb stem
may occur with a wide range of prefixes and affixes. The derivation
of nouns and verbs is an ongoing process. Most derivation is accom-
plished by affixes, many of which are used secondarily to derive
stems and have a primary function in some other area of the lan-
guage. There is a complex system of aspectual suffixes in Com-
anche; the nuances of the uses of that system await exploration. The
transitivity of the verb can be affected by the instrumental prefixes,
the unspecified argument prefixes, the benefactive/causative
marker, and by nominalizing {he verb:5.1.   Verbal roota    Morphologically, verbs can be highly complex. Because the ele-
ments that may be bound to the verb root or stem are discussed in
various sections of this work, a rough aketch of the verb and iis
affixes is included at this point:  OBI PRONOUN                                           VERBAL

verb stems occur with only one affix or with no affixation. A number
of roots are suppletive; these are discussed in section 5.1.2. The
shape of the typical verb root is CVCV. Stems may be formed from
the root plus an instrumental prefix, and, in fact, some roots do not
occur without an Instrumental (see section 5.2.1). In some cases an
incorporated noun is joined with a verb root to create a new verb
(section 5.2.2).","[125, 126, 127]"

the possessed noun is unmarked. The possessor nominal is marked
for possession by terminating the objective form of the noun with
the fortis final feature (-=). As Armagost points out (1980;52), de-
rived nouns that end in the nominalizing suffix -t#= have the pos-
sessive suffix -na=. This reflects a stage in which -ti> had the un-
derlying shape -tiN (i.c., it had the final feature “nasalized"") and
was followed by the basic objective suffix -%a, as discussed above.
Currently, -na* represents a separate posseasive suffix, paralleling
the emorgence of —ha as a separate suffix. A chart of the possessive
suffixes demonstrates this:Table 3.2. Objective and Possessive Forms of Nouns

"1.2 Overview
Introduction                                                               51.2.1.   Phonology
     The most unusual aspects of Comanche phonology are the re-
lated arena of final features and voiceless vowels. As with most
Numic languages, Comanche has, underlyingly, a single series of
voiceless stops, yet there are a large number of phonetic stops that
share place of articulation with those stops. For instance, p is found
as [p}, [v], [>] (a voiceless spirant), and [hp]. The explanation for
the various manifestations of p is that there exists a series of what
people who work on the Numic languages term final features. These
features generally occur as the last element of a stem or affix and
condition the shape of a following nonnasal stop or the affricate.
Thus, the postposition -pa?a™ ‘on’ has the shapes [-pa?al, [-va?a],
{-$a7a], or [-hpr?a] depending on the final feature of the noun it is
suffixed to:PHONETIC FORM     PHONEMIC FORM             GLOSS
(kwasu?upa?a)l   = kwasu?u=-pa’a=     on the dress (dress-on)
{arikava?a]        atika-pa?%a=       on the deer (deer-on)
[sanpiga%a)        saa=pth-pa?%a=     on the stomach (stomach-on)
[___hpaa)        (not attested)
ef, [wihpiti]     wtht-pite           to be near something (INST-arrive)      Although termed final, these features occasionally begin a mor-
pheme, and when they do they cancel out the final feature of the
preceding element. Thus, the bilabial in the absolutive suffix -=pth
always has the shape [p] regardless of the final feature of the stem
it is suffixed to, One of the final features is responsi         voice-
                                                         for theble
less vowels of the language. The intricacies of the final-feature sys-
tem are explored in chapter 2.

with an absolutive suffix when they are not a member of a com-
pound, incorporated, or followed by a postposition. Absolutive suf-
fixes are widely found on nouns in the Ute-Aztecan languages; they
do not have a discernable semantic function in Comanche, though
they may in other Uto-Aztecan languages: A rich system of post-
positions is used to express a number of locative and other adverbial
notions.","[17, 18, 19]"
"9.4, The presentative construction    The topic marker -fsa is used as the predicating element in a
construction that asserts the existence of an entity in the fashion,
“This ia the X that NP Y...” The NP in the schematic js in posses-
sive case and the verb that corresponds to Y is a nominalization.(219) [itsa névukuwaa nitsahani?enna)

ject of the main verb, a reflexive-possessive pronoun is used. If the
subject of the complement clause is different from the subject of the
main verb and it is expressed, it is in possessive case, If the subject
is different from the subject of the main clause but it is not ex-
pressed, or if the complement is an abstract concept such as ‘sing-
ing’, the indefinite subject prefix ta-* is used.
    The verb stem is nominalized in one of the following ways: A
verb stem is suffixed with either -na or -=pih-ha unless it is suf-
fixed with an aspect marker. The aspect markers -i (completive)
and -tu?i (unrealized) are nominalized with -ha. (See section 9.2.5
for a discussion of the differences between -na and -=pth in simple
nominalizations and section 9.3.1 for a list. of the nominalizing suf-
fixes found with complex sentences.)
     Whether -na or -=pth-ha    is affixed to the verb is determined by
the main verb of the sentence. The suffix -na nominalizes the com-
plement clause of all verbs but suai ‘to want, try. An example of
the difference between -na and -“pih-ha is:(12g)   [ukimann nii supane’7itt)

The first noun is suffixed with —?a™; note that it is terminated by
the final feature fortis, which is almost alwaya found as the last
element of the possessive case of nouns and pronouns (see sections
3.1.4 and 4.3). However, -?a= does not represent the normal pos-
sessive form of all of the nouns listed here. For instance, the posses-
sive of kwasu?u= ‘dress’ is kwasu-t*. Because the final feature of
-%a= is fortis, I assume a possessive relationship in that construe-
tion.

       Nouns that are frequently the first member of a compound occa-
sionally appear in truncated form. For instance, [tan] in ‘oatmeal’
(above) is a shorter form of taape ‘morning, day’, and yuu in ‘Mexi-
can reataurant’ is a short form of yuhu ‘fat, grease’. It is not possi-

following examples show ta=- occurring without any other nomi-
nalizing morphology, although the forms may have once ended with
a nominalizing final glottal stop (see below).

"       The verb of an object relative may be nominalized by a variety

als are followed by -ti= and are inflected for singular and plural
number und for objective and possessive case.
    Derivationally, the numerals are relatively opaque. The stem
moo in ‘five’ is probably the same stem as mo?o ‘hand’, and —pe
may be the adverbial affix used in expressions involving measure-
ment (section 7.1.2). The term hayakwasihi means ‘last’ and the
stem haya is no doubt related to ‘four’, which could be analyzed as
‘last’ and tokwe ‘exact’, indicating the last finger on the hand. The
auffix -mati in such expressions as ‘ten’ and         ‘twenty’ is also
translated as ‘more’.

                            VOWEL CLUSTERS      Vowel sequences (by which I mean two vowels that occur with-
out.an intervening consonant, with the exception of the glottal stop)
are: a nonfront vowel plus t (ai,-oi, ut, and ft) and any vowel except
¢ plus a (ia, oa, ua, and ta).* The sequence te also occurs. All se-
quences but ai are heterosyllabic; they occur with a transition be-
tween vowels. That transition ranges from a short pause toa sur-
face glottal stop. Stress, when present, is found on the first vowel of
the cluster (e.g., pia *big’), with the exception of ai, which is stressed
as a unit (e.g., tatvo, ‘white man’). The glottal, whether a transition
phenomenon or an integral part of the morpheme, does not cause a
two-vowel sequence to be counted as two short vowels, and thus the
final vowel of the sequence is not subject to devoicing. The form nite
‘me’ (ast PERS OBJ pronoun) is pronounced [ne] in all but the slowest
speech, which shows that heterosyllabic vowels can occasionally
come to be pronounced as though they occur in the same syllable.
When « is followed by i through affixation, the result is indistin-
guishable from the sequence within a morpheme. Thus, [ai] in [mi-
ni] mt?a-t ‘went’ (go-CMPL:ASP) sounds just like [ai] in [taivo]
taipo, ‘white man’.
      A phonetic [i] is often inserted between a and 4:      [naiYU)            ne-yuhu               bone marrow; lard;

                                 VOICELESS VOWELS     Short vowels may be either voiced or voiceless, Almost all voice-
less vowels in the language can be derived from their corresponding
voiced counterparts, with the exception of a and ¢, which usually
fall together na [f] when they are organically, or obligatorily, voice-
less. Optional, or inorganic, voiceless vowels (these terms are from
Miller) occur when a short, unclustered, unstressed final vowel oc-
curs before a pause:           {uva? otf)            u-pa%a>-ti=       on him(him-on-PRED)
ef.        [{tuuhkati ma]        tuHka-ti= ma      it’s deep (deep-PRED it)
     Voiceless vowels in Comanche were the focus of a controversy
between Canonge (1957) and Jakobson, Fant, and Halle (1967), the
former arguing for the phonemic status of voiceless vowels and the
latter maintaining that their occurrence is predictable. In his paper,
Canonge presents minimal pairs demonstrating a voiced-voiceless
contrast. The following are from that paper, and will be discussed at
the end of this section, (Canonge indicates stress preceding the
stressed syllable.) VD represents “voiced vowel” and VL represents

 s00- or soo=- ‘a lot, much’ is-also used adyerbially. The stem hi?i

 ‘how many?; some’. One of Canonge’s forms for ‘much, many’ js
 timarttmoa, My principal consultant: accepts that form, but:she
uses 800 ~ or tamma=- (tamma=tt, objective famma*ti). There is.no
obvious difference in the usage of soo- ~ soo=- and tamma=-. Both

"8.2, Simple sentences8.2.1. Sentence    markers    In many sentences, the topic of the narrative is marked by -tsa,
which Armagost describes as a marker of declarative or assertive
sentences, and a device for setting the stage in narrative,’ His anal-
ysis is clearly correct. Because -tsa is frequently found in isolated
(elicited) sentences as well, I have chosen to label it a topic marker,
as it can clearly be used to focus on what the speaker appears to
choose as the most important element of the sentence. [¢ is always
found on the first constituent, of the sentence. In at least one, and
possibly two constructions (the presentative and the comparative),
-tsa has-a predicative function (see sections 9.4 and 8.2.9).
     A_second sentence marker, -se, functions much as -tsa does in
marking and highlighting information? In narrative it is employed
in subsequent senlences after the topic has been introduced in a
beginning sentence by -tsa, Like -tsa, the marker -se occurs on the
first constituent of the sentence. In isolated sentences it is seem-
ingly interchangeable with -tsa (or with no sentence marker).
Armagost argues convincingly that, within narrative, -se is used to
signal contrast (i.e., a change of participants, referents, or scenes), 1
agree, and use his designation, with the caveat that this function is
not apparent in isolated sentences. Good examples of contrast are
found in (1) and (2)

 ~tsa and —se are suffixed to most; elements of the language with the
exception of postpositions and the main verb of the sentence, They
most frequently occur with the subject of the sentence. Within com-

"5.2.2.    Noun incorporation     Incorporated nouns have the effect of detransitivizing a transi-
tive verb. They are found fairly often in Comanche and are general-
ly used to describe habitual activities. The incorporated noun is the
bare root with no absolutive suffix, uninflected for case or number.
Occasionally, an incorporated noun plus verb yields a new intransi-
tive verb, as in [pukutsaka] ‘to witness, testify’ puku~tsaka (horse-
lead) (cf. puku-i horse-OBJ) and [piiokwe] ‘to bleed’ prt-okwe

                               NASALS    The nasals do not reflect the effects of the final features in the
same way that the oral stops do. They appear between vowels as
plain, long, or preaspirated. (Nasal length also marks durative as-
pect in verb roots that contain a nasal as a second consonant—see
section §.4-2:) Length occurs underlyingly in some morphemes, such
as some of the pronouns. Other nagals within a morpheme are op-
tionally pronounced as long when they follow a stressed vowel, espe-
cially—but not exclusively—when they occur between identical vow-
els. The [hn] (or [hm]) sequence within a morpheme such as kahni
‘house’ does not arise from the effects of the preaspirated final fea-
ture that is cognate to the Shoshone geminating final feature. Rath-
er, it reflects the Shoshone aspirated series (cf. Shoshone [kahni]
kahni.) Thus the [h] represents that h which causes the devoicing of
a preceding vowel in certain environments (described below in sec-
tion 2.2.4). At a morpheme boundary the nasals reflect the effects of
the final featuresin a manner similar to ¢ after a front vowel and k,
kw and ts. There is no difference between the fortis and lenis final
features, The prenspirating final feature causes an [hN] (h-nasal)
sequence and the aspirating final feature is realized as [VN] (voice-
less=vowel-nasal).

the final aspect suffix [YU] -yu=. (The derivation of [naYine] is dis-

"8.2.2.   Word order     Two conflicting factors affect word order: the basic SUBJECT
OBJECT VERB order of the language and the tendency to move the
subject into sentential second position,
     The basic order for intransitive sentences is SUBJECT VERB, As
discussed above, the subject, when followed by -tsa or -se, is in first
position (SUBJECT VERB). There is a strong tendency in Comanche
for the subject to be moved into sentential second position (i.e., fol-
lowing the first constituent). The first constituent can be as lengthy
as an adverbial phrase but is generally one lexical item. If no other
elements are present, and if it is not suffixed by -tsa or ~se, the sub-
ject is moved into second position, resulting in the order VERE SUB-
JECT, If another element such as an adverb is initial in the sentence,
the subject occurs in second position and the verb is in final posi-
tion, resulting in SUBJECT VERB word order.
     In transitive sentences with full nouns, the basic word order is
SUBJECT OBJECT VERB, However, because subject pronouns regularly
are moved into sentential second position if they are not empha-
sized by -tsa or ~se, the resulting order is OBJECT SUBJECT VERB for

Devoicing B
     Devoicing B produces a voiceless vowel when               a short, un-
stressed vowel is followed by s or by the h that is the true A present
both at the surface and in underlying forms. It never causes the
preaspiration found with the preaspirating final feature —H. That

(wekwi] wekwt ‘enter’ (PL SUBJ). These examples    are representative
of the majority of devoiced vowels in Comanche. Exceptions to De-
voicing B are discussed below,
     The presence of h in the underlying form explains most of the
remaining cases of organic voiceless vowels. Other examples of
voiceless vowels are found in section 2.1.2, which discusses the
effect of the aspirating final feature on the nonnasal stops and the
affricate.
     Devoicing B explains most of the forms in Canonge 1957. The
devoicing found in his data presented here is explained by the final
features that. are found morpheme-initially on some verb (and a few
noun) suffixes,
             Final features within the verb system     All verb roots with the exception of su?a™ ‘to think’, and kama=
‘to taste’ end in a vowel.*® Thus, a suffix that follows any root but
those will be spirantized if it begins with a p, or with t when it fol-
lows a nonfront vowel. There are, however, a number of verb. suf-
fixes that manifest fortis, preaspirating, or aspirating final features.
In these casea the suffix has a final feature as the first element of
the suffix.
     In Central Numic scholarship such suffixes are termed alter-
nuting suffixes. The final feature is determined by the preceding
verb stem, There are two pousibilities for the final feature: aspirat-
Phonology                                                                   31
    Examples are given below for -h/H/pinni, -h/H/ki, and
-h/H/tst. The labinl stop differs from the other suffixes of this type
because it becomes extremely lenis and voiceless (i.e., [¢]) after an
aspirating final feature. I cannot determine the shape of the aspect
auffix in such a case. The shape of the suffixes following a long
vowel is hypothesiztoedbe -HC                                with
                                . . ., because in the examples
~h/H/pinni following a long vowel the labial is (p), not [v], as in
‘boiling’, below. Whether the same is true for the other stops and
the affricate is not phonetically determinable, but to maintain
consistency I assign such suffixes the underlying form -HC....                              ~h/H/pinni

non, The first example has stress on the first syllable of the root and
secondary stress on every other vowel following, and the secondary
stress protects the e from devoicing. In the second example stress
falls on the reflexive na-, which has become the first syllable of the
word, and the e is left with no stress and is thus devoiced.  The forms
with -}/H/ka® are similar,
     The origin of the use of both allomorphs with the same verb
stem has been traced to’a very old (nonproductive) Central Numic
stress pattern. In Shoshone, where the same variation in the initial
consonant of many verbal affixes exists, the surface forms of the
initial consonants of ‘these affixes are CC and AC, as in the cor-

in several ways. They mark object and locative nouns in a clause as
being possessed by the subject of the clause, and are also used as
emphatics (i.e., ‘he himself did X’). In complex sentences they sre
used to indicate that the subject or object of the subordinate clause
is coreferential with (i.e., is identical to or overlaps with) the subject
of the main clause. The latter usage is discussed and described in

     7. Note the cultural implications of this sentence. Sons-in-law are rela-
tively impormanent, and the torm for thom is suffixed with -ha* tis,
whereas daughters-in-law, because the grandchildren remain with them,
are relatively permanent “possessions” and thus have the -pai suffix. Note
also that in Comanche this idea is expressed in two sentences.
     8. The e in pa%e is unexplained. I once obtained the form as pipa%eyutr,
with predicative -yu™, It may be that the e is raised by the y, or this may
represent  a very old i which was formerly used to predicate being.

simply juxtaposed without any postposition or particle, as in exam-
ple (2), which might be interpreted as two sentences. However, if it

                -n   COMPLETIVE;   other action will follow    Like -i - -%i, the suffix -n is completive. It is frequently used on
verbs as-a citation form, but is not found as often in isolated, con-
textless sentences. It is quite frequent in texts, and I believe the
meaning is something like ‘he/she did X and then ...'. In the stage
of Comanche represented by Canonge's texts, one finds two final
aspect suffixes that begin with <n; [-nu] or [-nU] COMPLETIVE and
[-na} or {[-nA] ‘continued action'.“* The final fu] and [a] after [n]
have vanished and the two suffixes are being reanalyzed as one.
The semantics of this final [-n] are still in a state of flux; in dis-
cussing the meaning of [-n], at various times I have been told, “It
means it’s in action” and “It means it’s past.” In elicitation, the
form of a verb being discussed in the-abstract (that is, not within a
sentence) is generally the form ending in {-n]. If I were to ask, “How
do you say ‘to see""? the response would very likely be [punin]. The
following examples are all fram texts. The final one demonstrates
the sequence of actions that the use of [-n] often seems to imply.

a progressive meaning. It is related—at, least historically—to

"     As recently as Canonge’s time, there were fewer “basic” objec-
tive suffixes: -@, -%a, ~i, and -ta ~ -Hta. The suffix -?a had the
allophone -ha when it followed.an aspirating stem, and -i had the
shape ~e when it followed a word ending in a or o (Armagost 1980:
49). The suffix -ha is still the objective ending used with stems that
end with the aspirating final feature, but. it is also the objective
suffix used for congonant-final English words,’ and these words
show no evidence of having an aspirating final feature. Further, -ha
54                                                  COMANCHE GRAMMARthe absolutive suffix -—pi.
     In Canonge’s data the objective suffixes have the lenis final
feature, in contrast with the fortis final feature of the possessive
(section 3.1.4). Thus, a sentence like example (21) has the objective
suffix pattern -?a with the p of the following verb in lenis form ([v]).
While this generally holds true for the objective, there are also a
number of examples in which the final feature following the
objective seems to be suspended. And if the following word begins
with p or ¢, that consonantis fortis, as in example (12). Because the
object is often topicalized and thus is found in sentence-inital
position, where it is separated from the verb by a second-position
element or terminated by -tsa or -se (see section 8.2.1), its final
feature may be in the process of being lost.(1a)   [ubka nii posarenapi?a vunin)}

7.3. Narrative particles
    The narrative particles discussed in this section are used to
perform three functions: they demonstrate that a sentence or group
of sentences is a quotation (me); they mark the beginning of a
narrative (tia); or they give information about the speaker's
knowledge of the narrative; if it is not firsthand knowledge, the
Adverbs and Modat Particles                                          187begin texts in which the speaker had no firsthand participation.
Note that examples (221) and (222) use the narrative past marker
 ~ki and that the stories begin with [soovesi] soo-pe-st= ‘much
time’. Some combination of [soovesi] with —-kt, -tsa (topic), and tta
is the common beginning for a Comanche story. The combination
means ‘long, long ago’; the English equivalent is ‘once upon a time’.
The order of the elements varies greatly, as the examples demon-
strate: Example (122), atypically, has tia without -tsa or -k1, Tho
story, a Coyote tale, also contains no examples of -ki (again, this is
not typical): Example (123) demonstrates -tia within a narrative. It
does not mark the beginning of the narrative, though it does intro-
duce a list of possible choices (i.c., which kind of movie to choose).(129)   [tia ninj hayarokweti]

"                     Exceptions to Devoicing B
    Armagost has researched this problem in depth, and finds that
the expected voiceless vowels do not occur in some cases. According
to Armagost (1986), voicelessness is suspended for the following
reasons:
     * When the consonant preceding the vowel that should be de-
      voiced is identical] to the s or h following the vowel or is
      comparable in stridency with the s which follows the vowel,
      devoicing does not occur.
     * Two consecutive syllables cannot be organically voiceless. If.a
       syllable is voiceless, the vowel in the next syllable rightward

which u is not devoiced when it is followed by -se ‘contrast’. These
forma include the following, (Armuagost believes that [wihnuse] is
explained by the rule of i-metathesis deacribed below. At this point,
I do not agree with his conclusion, but do not have an alternative

3.2. Postpositions
72                                                  COMANCHE GRAMMAK
       Postpositions are suffixed to nouns, pronouns, and demonstra-
tives. The pronominals that take postpositions are described in sec-
tion 4.4. Predicates are formed from postpositions with the addition
of the yerbalizing suffixes -yu™ and -ti™ (discussed in section 8.2.9).
If a nominalization is created by the suffix -=, that form may then
have the objective form [-ti] (plural [-tii]).
     According to Miller (in press), the choice of locative postposition
from amdng the many forms avuilable is, in Shoshone, explained by
the verb involved. For instance, ‘to, toward’ may be -hka™ or
-kaHtu™. The former suffix is used with an intransitive verb. The
latter in Shoshone is also used with an intransitive verb, but ex-
presses the end point of the action. Remnanis of this system are
found in Comanche, as in the following examples:(72)    [Vanessama?ai nikwT tohtinka yikirikw]
