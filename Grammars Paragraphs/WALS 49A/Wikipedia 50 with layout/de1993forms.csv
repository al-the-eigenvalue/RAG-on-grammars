3.2 NOUNS
  Nouns are words which may take possessive pronominal prefixes (see section 3 .3).
Apart from the expression of possession there is no noun-related morphology.
   Functionally, nouns are the unmarked heads of noun phrases (NP). As such they may be
modified by adjectives. Other categories that may function as heads of NP, for example,
pronouns, do not have this possibility of adjectival modification.
   Semantically, kinship terms form an interesting category of nouns in Kombai because of
the extensive skewing of 'natural' and terminological generations (see de Vries 1987).
  Compound nouns may be formed by combining noun stems into one noun. The
modifying stem always precedes the modified stem in the compound noun, for example,
wodei 'river' and bei 'bank' may be combined to become wodeibei 'riverbank'; the
modifying stem attracts the main word stress in these compounds.
   There are also compound nouns in which the two noun stems are equivalent, that is,
without a modifier/modified relation; for example momo ' mother's brother' and lage 'sister's
son' are combined to form the noun momolage 'family'.
   There is no derivation of nouns from verbs or other categories. When clauses function as
NP (subordinate clauses), there is some restructuring towards a more nominal form but this
restructuring hardly affects the verb of the embedded clause; instead, head noun insertion
takes place. Only in purpose clauses with Ii do we find infinitival forms in the embedded
                                                                                             35
clause; infinitives (see section 3. 1 .3 .5) have to a certain extent nominal properties. (See
Chapter 5 for Kombai nominalisation.)
3.3 PRONOUNS
    Kombai has six personal pronouns:
( 1 46)   SO    1:    nu      I
                2:    gu      you
                3:    khe     he/shelit
          PL    1:    nagu    we
                2:    nage    you (PL)
                3:    ya      they
Some speakers have agu instead of nagu ( 1 PL personal pronoun).
   When prefixed to nouns, the forms of ( 1 46) function as possessive pronouns. For I S O
and 3PL there are special possessive forms:
( 1 47)   SO    1:   na-      my                na-biyo         my coconut
                2:   gu-      your              gu-biyo         your coconut
                3:   khe-     his/her/its       khe-biyo        his coconut
          PL    1:   nagu-    our               nagu-biyo       our coconut
                2:   nage-    your (PL)         nage-biyo       your coconut
                3:   yano-    their             yano-biyo       their coconut
For the 3PL possessive form some speakers have yafo-.
    Reflexive pronouns are formed by suffixing -ra ' self' to the forms of ( 1 46) (nu-ra, khe­
ra, etc.):
( 1 48)   Kho mene khe-ra       bafera.
          man   this him-self DUR. see.3S0.NF
          This man is seeing himself.
Emphatic or focus forms are formed by adding the focus marker -a (see section 3.8.3.2. 1 ) to
the forms of ( 1 46) (nuf-a, guf-a, etc.):
( 1 49)   Doti nuf-a         adu-ra                     badiya ?
          sago me-FOe prepare.in.the.fire. S S-and DUR.give.2S0.NF
          Is it for me that you are preparing the sago?
                                                                                   ,
When the forms of ( 1 46) take -a, their final consonants are retained (e.g. nuf ,! ) which are
deleted by final consonant deletion in ( 1 46).
   -ra ' self is not only used in reflexive conditions but may also express focus in personal
pronouns:
(1 50)    Khe-ra kh wui fa.
          he-FOe theft do. 3 S 0 .NF
          He stole.

3.4 ADJECTIVES
     Adjectives are words functioning as modifiers in noun phrases:
(151)     Nu makhii fefe-khe     ferade.
          I   dog     skinny-AD] see. l S G.NF
          I saw a skinny dog.
Secondarily, adjectives function as predicates:
( 1 52)    Makhii mofene fefe-khe.
           dog    that     skinny-AD]
           That dog is skinny.
In terms of form, adjectives can be defined as those words which take either the adjectival
suffix -khe (-ge after adjective stems ending in a nasal vowel) or the intensifier -rabo. Both
-khe and -rabo mark a word as belonging to the category of adjectives. -khe is semantically
neutral but -rabo has intensifying meaning:( 1 53)   makhii yafe-rabo
          dog     good-very
          a very good dog
Some adjectives, like mujano 'big' , may occur (and generally do occur) without either -khe
or -rabo:
( 1 54)    kho mujano
          man    big
           a big man
Adjectives have plural forms which are rather infrequent; these plural forms are formed by
reduplication of the first syllable of the adjective:
( 1 55)   rubu-          bad
          rurubu-        bad (PL)
The adjective mujano big has a special plural form muyiyano 'big (PLY. The intensifier -rabo
has a reduplicated form -rorabo. Compare ( 1 56):
( 1 56)   makhii fefe-rorabo
          dog     skinny-very.PL
          very skinny dogs
Adjectives may be preceded by ago- 'somewhat':
( 1 57)   fefekhe        skinny
(1 58)    agofefekhe     a little skinny/somewhat skinny
There is no morphological comparative; comparison is done by periphrasis:
( 1 59)   Yafu mene mujano, mofene riyagokhe.
          prahu this big         that     little
          This canoe is bigger than that one.
                                                                                               373.5 OTHER NOMINAL MODIFIERS
3.5. 1 DEMONSTRATIVES
    Mene (some speakers: mena) 'thislhere' is the speaker-related demonstrative in Kombai
(in the proximity of the speaker):
( 1 60)   Kho mene yaboma.
          man   this    ill.3SG.NF
          This man is ill.
(161)     Mene yaie-rabo.
          this    good-very
          This is very good.
In ( 1 60) mene functions as a modifier within the NP, in ( 1 6 1 ) as the head of the NP. The use
of mene implies definiteness of the NP within which mene is used.
   When functioning as a nominal modifier, mene generally occurs postnominally but it may
also occur before the noun:
( 1 62)   Mena-n-o         biyo rubu-khe.
          this-TR-CONN coconut bad-ADJ
          This coconut is bad.
Like all prenominal modifiers, the prenominal demonstrative is linked by the connective -0 to
its head noun (see section 3.8.2. 1).
   Mene also functions as marker of topics and frames. These discourse functions of mene
will be treated in 3.8. 3.2.2 (see examples (255)-(256».
    Mofene (some speakers: mofena) is the addressee-related demonstrative (in the proximity
of the addressee):
( 1 63)   Mofene ai-a.
          that      house-PRED
          That is a house.
( 1 64)   Kho mofene rubu-khe.
          man  that     bad-ADJ
          That man is bad.
( 1 65)   Mofena-n-o       kho rubu-khe.
          that-TR-CONN man bad-ADJ
          That man is bad.
Mofene and mene function both as demonstratives and as place/time adverbs, mene meaning
'this '/'here'/'now' and mofene 'that'/' there'/'then' (see section 3.7). The range of functions
of demonstratives in Kombai (demonstrative modifier, place/time adverbs, markers of
topicality) has been found in several Papuan languages, for example, in Usan (Reesink
1987) and in Urim (Hemmila 1989).
   There is a third person-related deictic makho 'there ' (far away from both speaker and
addressee). Thus far we have found this makho only as a place-adverb, and not (yet) as a
demonstrative or a time-adverb. Example:
38( 1 66)    . . .khumo-ra makho Romalii biirii khano.
                die.SS-and there Romalli place go.3PL.NF
           ... they die and go there to Romalli's place.
    The deictics are also combined with the stative verbs lei- 'to lie', le- 'to stand' and ba- 'to
sit' (see section 3 . 1 .3.4) to form deictic verbs which are frequently used in Kombai. These
stative-deictic verbs are always durative and this is expressed by the future durative suffix -
maJe-, the non-future durative suffix -nege- and a suffix -re- which only occurs in these
deictic-stative verbs. When -re- occurs in these verbs, they are always used in present tense
durative conditions. It seems that -re- is a present durative marker. Only in this group of
verbs do we fmd a three-way opposition of past, present and future, related to the time of the
utterance. This deictic time-framework of past, present and future is combined with a three­
way place-framework of close to the speaker, close to the addressee, and close to third
person (=neither close to speaker nor to addressee).
     The future forms have this set-up:
( 1 67)    deictic+fut.stem+fut(-e)+-male- +person+number+fut.(-e)
( 1 68) exemplifies ( 1 67):( 1 68)    Nu mofekho-Ia-n-e-male-f-e.
           I   there-stand-TR-F-DUR- l SG-F
           I shall be standing there.
The durative present forms of the deictic-stative verbs have this form:
( 1 69)    deictic+NF-stem+ -re- (DUR.PRES)+person+number
The first person endings in the durative-present forms have an additional lei: thus I S G is -Fe
and I PL -fone.
     ( 170) exemplifies ( 1 69):
( 1 70)    Nagu me-Ia-re-fene.
           we    here-stand-DUR.PRES- 1 PL
           We are standing here.
The durative past forms have this set-up:
(171)      deictic+NF-stem+-nege- + NF-marker+person+number
( 1 72) exemplifies ( 1 7 1 ):
( 172)     Nagu me-ba-nege-de-fone.
           we   here-sit-DUR.PAST-NF- I PL
           We were sitting here.
The endings after -nege- are the normal non-future endings but with the addition of an -e;
thus the normal non-future ending for 1 PL -defo becomes -defone in deictic verbs with
durative-past tense, with a transitional nasal. The normal zero-ending for the NON- 1 SG.NF
becomes -ne (transitional nasal + -e) and so forth.
   Thus deictic verbs have a deictic prefix expressing place and a tense-dependent durative
suffix.
  The deictic slot is filled by either me- 'here (where the speaker is) ' , related to the
demonstrative mene 'thislhere' , or the addressee-related mofekho- 'there' or the third person
                                                                                                    39
related deictic makho- 'there ' ; the addressee-related form mofene does not occur in deictic
verbs (see above); on the other hand mofekho- does not occur as a demonstrative modifier
but it does occur adverbially (mofekhone 'there').
   All the nine possible combinations of time and place do occur: 'close to the speaker/before
utterance-time' , 'close to addressee/ at utterance-time' , 'far away (third person)/after the
utterance-time ' , and so on. For example:
( 1 73)   a.    makholanemalefone                   we shall be standing there
          b.    melanemalefone                      we shall be standing here
          c.    mofekholanemalefone                 we shall be standing there
          d.    melare                              he is standing here
          f.    mofekholare                         he is standing there
          g.    makholare                           he is standing there
          h.    makhobanegedefe                     I was sitting there
          i.    mebanegedefe                        I was sitting here
          j.    mofekhobanegedefe                   I was sitting there
3.5.2 QUANTIFIERS
    There is a small class of invariable quantifying words occurring in the rightmost position
in term phrases. Examples: biduma 'many ' , 'much ' , mofolumo 'little ' .
    Compare ( 1 74):
( 1 74)   makhii muyiyano biduma
          dog    big.PL   many
          many big dogs
3.5.3 NUMERATORS
    The Kombai counting system is basically a body-part counting system. Thus the words
denoting certain parts of the human body have as second meaning the numbers. Body-part
tallying systems are common in New Guinea languages (Laycock 1 975). The Kombai
system is of the usual type which employs the fingers, parts of the arm and the head, that is it
does not use n amed points on the lower half of the body (Laycock 1975:220). 7

          dodou                  1.    shoulder             2.    ten7    An interesting unusual variety is reported by Bruce ( 1984:320) for Alamblak, a Papuan language of
     Papua New Guinea (East Sepilc), which has a men's tally system and a women's tally system. The
     system used by women uses two low points (the breasts) to the exclusion of points in the face.

          khabiya              1.     head               2.    twelve
Counting is accompanied by touching the relevant body-part with the middle finger or index
finger; the little finger of the left hand is the starting point (this is the usual starting point,
Laycock 1 975 :220) and the head is the turning point, after which the counting goes down
again via the right-hand side of the body, by adding the word imofo 'on the other side' to the
numbers:( 176)    imofo TUro           1.   ear on the other side                 2.   thirteen
          imofo dodou          1.   shoulder on the other side            2.   fourteen

          imoforaga            1.   little fmger on the other side        2.   twenty-three
When the numbers function attributively in term-phrases, they take the attributive suffix
-khu:
( 1 77)   kho abalo-khu
          man five-ATfR
          five men
After nasal vowels we find -gu instead of -khu (see section 2.3 for this nasal assimilation):
( 1 78)   kho g6-gu
          man six-ATfR
          six men
-khu basically means 'also', 'added':
( 1 79)   Nu-khu bomede.
          I-also   DUR.come . 1 S G.NF
          I am also coming.","[44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]"

3. 1 .3.4 COPULAS; THE VERB 'TO BE'
   Copula-support is a syntactic process which enables members of nominal categories
(nouns, adjectives, pronouns) to function predicatively. When supported by copulas, such
nominal predicates retain their categorial status as nouns.
                                                                                                  31       -ma derivation is a lexical process o f verbalisation, for example, with the help of the
    support-verb -ma adjectives are turned into verbs (see section 3. 1 .2. 1 ) .
        There are two copulas i n Kombai, - a and (fe-). . -do. - a is a positive predicative clitic,
    cliticised to the nominal predicate:
    (121)     Mene af-a.
              this    house-PRED
              This is a house.
    ( 1 22)   Mene a.
              this    house
              This is a house.
    -a is optional (see ( 1 22». In ( 1 22) the final consonant of af 'house' has been deleted (see
    section 2.3).
        With adjectival predicates -a may occur but it is generally absent:
    ( 1 23)   Mofene rubu-khe.
              that     bad-AJ)J
              That is bad.
    ( 1 24)   Mofene rubu-khe-y-a.
              that     bad-ADJ-TR-PRED
              That is bad.
    When the adjective has the intensifier -rabo, -a is always absent:
    ( 1 25)   A     mene yafe-rabo.
              house this good-very
              This house is very good.
    With personal pronouns as predicates, the predicative is always present:
    ( 1 26)   Mene nuf-a!
              this    I-PRED
              This is me!(fhis is mine.
    Example ( 1 26) may be used when for example the speaker recognises himself on a picture.
    Generally, however, personal pronouns, when used predicatively, have possessive meaning.
       In questions, which have the optional question-clitic -kha, the predicative -a and the
    question-clitic may co-occur:
    ( 1 27)   Mene af-a-kha ?
              this    house-PRED-Q
              Is this a house?
    (fe-)' .. -do is the negative predicative, contrasting with -a:
•
    ( 1 28)   Mene a-do.
              this    house-NEG.PRED
              This is not a house.
    ( 1 29)   Mene af-a.
              this   house-PRED
              This is a house.
32The copula nature of (fe-). .. -do also explains why this negation is restricted to infinitival
fOTITIS of the verb which have nominal status (see section 3 . 1 .3.5).
     -a and (fe-). .. -do function in both attributive and identifying predications:
( 1 30)    Kho    mene n-are-y-a.
           person this    my-father-TR-PRED
           This person is my father.
(131)      Kho     mene n-are-do.
           person this    my-father-NEG.PRED
           This person is not my father.
( 1 32)    Mofene foroy-a.
           that     good-PRED

           That is not good.
Locative/existential 'to be' is expressed by independent forms of the verbs ba- 'to sit', lei- 'to
lie' and le- 'to stand' ; they occur with both definite and indefmite subjects:
( 1 34)    Guru      mene ba ?
           teacher here sit. 3 S G. NF
           Is the teacher here?
( 1 35)    Khuro e      bano.
           jungle bird sit.3PL.NF
           There are birds in the jungle.
The three stative verbs ba- 'to sit, to be' , lei- ' to be, to lie' and le- 'to be, to stand' are
classificatory verbs in the sense that size and shape of the entity denoted by the first argument
of the stative verbs, determine which of the three stative verbs should be used. Small entities,
like cucumbers and snakes always 'lie ', big entities 'stand' when they are tall and high, like
trees and houses, but 'sit' when the vertical dimension does not dominate in the perception.
In the case of human beings, it depends on the position they are thought to be in. For
example in ( 1 34) the teacher is supposed to 'sit' in the house.
     Some examples:
( 1 36)    Khuro ai-nuwayo          leno.
           jungle pig-cassowary stand.3PL.NF
           In the jungle there is big game.
( 1 37)   Khuro gwari lei.
          jungle snake lie.3SG.NF
          There is a snake in the jungle.
( 1 38)    Dodo edolo leino.

           There are fruits in the trees.
                                                                                                 33
( 1 39)   Ramu        Jei?
          cucumber lie.3SG .NF
          Is there cucumber?
( 1 40)   Na-khorabo a         mene ba-do.
          my-wife      house this sit. INF.NF-NEG.PRED
          My wife is not in this house?
An important and frequent use of the stative verbs is as deictic verbs (see section 3.5. 1 ).
   Classificatory existential verbs occur in many Trans-New Guinea languages (Lang 1975).
Drabbe ( 1 953 :39) describes five existential verbs for Kamoro (stand, sit, lie, float, be
above), the use of which is determined by the habitual position of the subject referents of the
existential verb. Voorhoeve ( 1 965 :48) states that the Asmat ""divide all existing things
into . . .five 'position ' classes"". These classes correspond to those of Kamoro (Drabbe
1 953:39).
   Enga, a Papuan language of Papua New Guinea has an elaborate and interesting system
of seven existential verbs including an existential verb mandenge used for ""referents that are
reproductive, such as: pongo 'penis', kambake 'vagina ' , ipi ' testicles""'. The choice of the
existential verb depends ""on the habitual (i.e. existential) posture or shape of the referent as
perceived by the Enga"" (Lang 1 975 :47).
   Drabbe ( 1 957: 32) has described the three existential verbs of Aghu, an Awyu family
language, bagh 'to sit', ek ' to stand' and ig 'to lie', with the habitual or actual position of the
subject referent determining the choice of the existential verb.","[40, 41, 42, 43]"
"
16   For example Drabbe (1955: 1 33) on Marind: .. .Jet erop hoe men de gedachte, het molief weergeef tin de
                                                 ""
     directe rede."" (,Notice how the thought, the motive is represented by direct speech.'). Drabbe (1957:85)
     on the Awyu language Aghu: ...numo-gh, aldus zeggen, betekent mer: aldus tot zichzelfzeggen, of: aldus
                                  ""
     denken... "" ( ... numo-gh, to say thus, means here: to say thus to oneself, or: to think thus .. . ) .
                 '                                                                             '
966.3. 1 IN'IENTION
   The use of quotative elements and forms of 'to say' in intentional contexts is a very
common feature of Papuan languages (see Healey 1 964 for Telefol, Deibler 1 97 1 for
Gahuku, de Vries 1 989:30 for Wambon, Reesink 1984:2 1 6 for Usan, Foley 1 986: 1 56- 1 57
for an overview). Both direct and indirect quotation constructions play a role in intentional
contexts. Longacre ( 1972:84) reports the use of indirect quotes in Yes san-Mayo intentional
expressions: ""Thus in Yes san-Mayo, Intent is expressed in an Indirect Quote Sentence, e.g.
'She village will see, she said', meaning 'She intended to see the village ....
   An important factor determining the use of quotations in intentional constructions is
whether intender and intended are the same or not (Foley 1986: 1 56). In (373), for example,
the intender (John) and the intended person (Mary) differ but in (374) they are the same:
(373)     John wants Mary to leave
(374)     John wants to leave
According to Foley ( 1986), in (373) an act of communication between John and Mary is
essentially involved, from the point of view of Papuan languages. Indeed, when intender and
intended differ in Kombai, the use of direct quotation-forms is obligatory:
(375)     Camate luwa               kho     yademo-nane-ne.
          head     say.3SG.NF person meet-IMP.PL-QUOTE.SG
          The district head wants the people to come together.
(376)     Guru     ya     luwa-no         furuma khakhe-nane-neno.
          teacher them say-3PL.NF well          listen-IMP.PL-QUOTE.PL
          The teachers want them to listen well.
The verb of speaking luwa- is used in this type of intentional construction. Examples (375)
and (376) can be used to report speech and to report intention (thought).
   When intender and intended are the same, the category of person is an important factor
determining the form of intentional expressions.
     With fIrst person intenders, Kombai uses intentional verb-forms, without quotations:
(377)     Nu okh        ami.
          I water drink.1SG.INT
          I want to drink water.!Let me drink water.
(378)     Ai-fo.
          go-IPL.INT
          We want to go./Let us go.
However, quotation is used with first person intenders in one type of purposive construction
in which motion-verbs are used and plural intentional forms of the verb in the direct
quotation:
(379)     Nu me-Ia-ra                ai   galemo-fo-nera       wa-me-de.
          I come-stand-SS.and pig buy-lPL.INT-QUOTE COM-come-ISG.NF
          I have come to buy the pig.
Motion-verbs both precede and follow the direct quotation in (379). Voorhoeve ( 1 965: 177)
notices the presence of the quotation marker in/un/n in purposive expressions of Asmat.
Since in Voorhoeve's data there are motion-verbs and intentional verb forms (m-/m V- forms
                                                                                           97of Asmat) involved, examples like po mipipim un ameremer in 'he went there to cut off
midribs (of the sago palm)' can be analysed along the same lines as (379) of Kombai.
    With second/third person intenders, Kombai uses the ftrst person intentional verb-forms
in combination with direct quotation:
(380)     Ai-fo-nene.
          go-IPL.INT-QUOTE.PL
          They want to go.
(38 1 )   Yarimo kho       fera-f-e-ne.
          garden go. S S see-ISG.INT-CONN-QUOTE.SG
          He wants to see his garden.
I have not found, thusfar, a lexical item 'to want' but there are lexical items for negative
intention ('to not want something'). Examples are the adjectives bukhe and bidoge, both
meaning 'reluctant' and the verbs lome- and biduma- 'to refuse'. All these items, whether
verbal or adjectival, take nominal inftnitive complements:
(382)     Kha-n-o                   biduma-no.
          go.INF.NF-TR-CONN refuse-3PL.NF
          They do not want to go.
(383)     Nu kha-n-o                      bukhe.
          I    go.INF.NF-TR-CONN reluctant
          I do not want to go.
The connective 0 links the infinitival complements to the verbal head of the clause in (382)
                  -and to the adjectival head of the clause in (383).
   Although it is possible to express negative intention without quotation-forms (as in (382)­
(383)), negative intention may also be expressed with direct quotation and that is the most
frequent way of expressing negative intention. Thus, of (384) and (385), the preferred
option seems to be (385):
(384)     Obate       mi-n-o                       lome-ge.
          medicine drink.INF.NF-TR-CONN refuse-3SG.NF
          He refuses to drink the medicine.
(385)     Obate       mi-n-o                       lome-def-e-ne.
          medicine drink.INF.NF-TR-CONN refuse-ISG.NF-CONN-QUOTE
          He refuses to drink the medicine.
We may conclude that, when intender and intended are the same, the use of direct quotation
is not obligatory in all cases. With ftrst person intenders, quotation is not used (cf. (377)­
(378)), except for purposive constructions with motion-verbs (cf. (379)). For second/third
person intenders, quotation is obligatory with positive intention but with negative intention
lexical means are available that do not involve direct quotation (cf. (382)-(383)), although
even in that case the form using direct quotation (example (385)) seems to be the preferred
option.
   These facts point to the tendency in Kombai to use direct quotation not only when
intender and intended differ but also when they are the same. This is because there is, from
the Kombai point of view, an act of communication involved both when intender and
98intended differ and when they are the same, although in this last case perhaps in a weaker
sense: in that case the intender communicates with himself, in 'inner speech'.","[105, 106, 107, 108]"
"3.6 QUESTION-WORDS
    In question-word questions there occurs a small closed set of question-words that has the
following characteristics.
  In the first place, although some of the question-words function as head of the questioned
NP, the majority of question-words in Kombai functions as modifier in the questioned NP.
   S econdly, the position of the question-word in the clause depends on the functional
specification of the questioned NP in which the question-word functions as head or modifier.
   Thirdly, question-word phrases have the focus function because they present the
relatively most salient information in that context. Consider the following examples:
( 1 83)   Gu naluf-a      afo-n-e-khe ?
          you what-FOC take-TR-2SG.INT-Q
          What do you want to take?
(1 84)    Yafo-miyof-a-khe gu-n-agarabo lefa-khe?
          who-person-FOC-Q your-TR-thing take.away.3SG.NF-Q
          Who took your things away?
In ( 1 83) the question-word nalufa 'what' is head of the questioned NP. In ( 1 84) we have the
unmarked case: the question-word functions as a modifier in the questioned phrase. In ( 1 83)
nalufa may be replaced by narofo ro 'what thing' which has the unmarked modifier + head
structure.
    In ( 1 83) the question-word has object function and therefore occupies the object position
in the clause. In ( 1 84) the questioned NP has subject function and is positioned accordingly.
   The focus nature of question-words is in Kombai expressed by intonational prominence
and the (optional) focus-marker -a (see section 3.8.3.2. 1 ) . In the Flamingo B ay dialect of the
neighbouring Asmat family emphasising words (Voorhoeve 1 965 : 1 68) also occur with
certain question-words (Voorhoeve 1965 : 1 59).
   In ( 1 83) and ( 1 84) we find this focus-marker -a before the question-marker -khe (see
section 3 . 1 .3.3.4. 1 .2). This question-clitic which occurs optionally in all types of questions
as a clause-final predicate-clitic, occurs in question-word questions also on the questioned
NP (optionally).
   As stated above, the question-words function preferably as modifiers in modifier + head
structures. Now with question-words concerning persons the modifier is yafo- 'who' and
the head noun is one of the following nouns:
( 1 85)   miyo              child
          rum u             son
          mogo              person
                                                                                                   43
          nariya             man
          nariyamogo         man
With question-words concerning things, the modifier is narofo ' what' and the head noun TO
' thing ' .
    Some examples:
( 1 86)   Gu narof-o         TO    bo-fera-kha ?
          you what-CONN thing DUR-see.2SG.NF-Q
          What are you looking at?
( 1 87)   Makhii mofene yafo-miyo makhii-khe?
          dog    that      who-child dog-Q
          Whose dog is that?
( 1 88)   Gu agarabo mene yafo-rumu adiya-ne-khe?
          you thing   this who-son       give-2SG.F-Q
          Whom will you give this thing?
The head nouns in the questioned NP have primarily a grammatical function of supplying a
head for the questioned NP. Accordingly they have in the question-word context a
generalised gramm atical meaning and not their specific lexical content. All the nouns of ( 1 85)
have in the question-word context the same general meaning of 'person' , whereas in their
normal lexical use they all have their specific meanings (see de Vries 1 987 for a detailed
discussion of the specific meanings of the kinship-terms of ( 1 85)).
   We find TO 'thing' and the 'person' nouns of ( 1 85) in this role of supplying a grammatical
head with a generalised meaning in relative and adverbial subordinate clauses also. In
Chapter 5 these clauses will be treated and the role that the head nouns play in them. Here we
shall give only one example of rumu as grammatical head in a relative clause (RC)
construction:
( 1 89)   Nagu-are i       fla-n-o              rumu. .           .          our-father earth make.3SG.NF-TR-CONN person
          Our Father who created the earth. . .
I t i s clear that i n ( 1 89) the specific lexical meaning o f rumu 'son' (see d e Vries 1987) is not
relevant. In ( 1 89) rumu supplies a grammatical head for the RC. Nagu-are in ( 1 89) is the
semantic-pragmatic head of the RC. These double-headed RC are the normal type of RC in
Kombai.
    The question-word nalufa 'what' (see example ( 1 83)) may also mean 'why ' :
( 1 90)   G u naluf-a     m unu-do-khe ?
          you why-FOC come-NEG-Q
          Why did you not come?
There is another expression for 'why' and this has the preferred modifier+head structure:
(191)     Gu narof-o    ri-n-a        miyo udo-ma-n-a
          you what-CONN reason-TR-FOC child push-S UPP.2SG.NF-TR-CONN (DS)
          khalufa-kha?
          fall.3SG .NF-Q
          Why did you make the child fall?
44In ( 1 9 1 ) the focus marker -a appears on the questioned NP. The connective -0 links the
modifier narof- ' what' to the head noun ri 'reason' .
  The element fene- occurs in a number of question-words. I n the first place in the locative
question-words fenemo ' where' (destination), fenemokho 'where ' (location) and fenemaya
mio 'from where' (source) :
( 192)    Gu fenemo ba-kha-khe?
          you where DUR-go.2SG.NF-Q
          Where are you going?
( 1 93)    Ya fenemaya mogo bomakha?
          they from. where person they.are.coming.Q
          Where do they come from?
( 1 94)   Gu-yarimo fenemokho le-kha?
          your-garden where     be. 3SG.NF-Q
          Where is your garden?
The locative source question-word fenemaya always goes with one of the 'person '
grammatical head nouns of ( 1 85). Although diachronically the element -kho in fenemokho
' w here ' is probably the question-eli tic -kha (harmonised), synchronically the form
fenemokho 'where ' (location) contrasts with fenemo ' where' (destination). The question­
clitic, which may be attached to all other question-words may not be attached to fenemo
' where ' (destination) and must be attached to fenemokho 'where ' (location). The conclusion
seems safe that -kho in fenemokho no longer functions as a question-clitic.
   Notice that in the fene- based question-words there is also the element -mo/-ma, probably
the support-verb -mao This suggests a verbal origin for these question-words. This
possibility is also suggested by the question-word for ' how ' fenemora, which contains the
relator -ra which we otherwise only find with dependent verbs (see section 3 . 1 .3.2.2):
( 1 95)   Fenemora khe khone-kha?
          how       he get. 3SG. NF-Q
          How did he get it?
We also find the element fene- in the question-words for ' when ' and ' how much ' . The
question-words for 'when ' are:
( 1 96)   Narof-o   rei-khe?
          what-CONN day-Q
          When?
( 1 97)   Fenan-e   rei-khe?
          what-CONN day-Q
          When?
In ( 1 97) the connective -e, which links the modifier to the head noun rei 'day ' , is the
harmonised form of -0.
     The question-word for 'how much ' is:
( 1 98)   Fenemagu-khe ?
          how.much-Q
          How much?
                                                                                               45
3.7 ADVERBS   In Kombai adverbs are invariably words whose sole function it is to be heads of satellite
phrases (see Dik 1 978), that is optional, non-nuclear phrases specifying the peripheral
circumstances of the nuclear predication, such as time, location or manner. In such phrases
adverbs cannot take modifiers. For example:
( 1 99)   Khe khufade flakha.
          he  long.ago go.away. 3 S G. NF
          He went away long ago.
In ( 1 99) khufade 'long ago' is an adverb. This word only functions as the head of optional
time phrases. It cannot be modified.
    Adverbs form a small class of words because in Kombai other categories take over much
of the functional load of adverbs. Consider:
(200)     Gu        mofene domo aini!
          you (SG) there   not  go.IMP
          Do not go there!
(20 1 )   Mofene n u miyo muriyago.
          then      I child little
          At that time I was a little child.
(202)     Kho mofene na-momo.
          man  that    my-uncle
          That man is my uncle.
(203)     Furu-mo            kha.
          good- S UPP. S S go. 3 S G . NF
          He travelled well.
(204)     Agu-mu          me.
          slow-SUPP. S S come.3SG.NF
          He came slowly.
In (202) we see the demonstrative mofene as a modifier in a NP (see section 3.5. 1). In (20 1 )
w e see this demonstrative a s the head of a time phrase meaning 'then' a n d in (200) a s the
head of a locative phrase meaning 'there' . Demonstratives take over much of the functional
load of spatio-temporal adverbs in Kombai. Since the adverbial function of mofene is not the
only function of that word (it also and primarily functions as a modifier in NPs), the
definition of adverbs given above rules mofene out.
   S i milarly, dependent verb forms with the support-verb -ma take over much of the
functional load of manner adverbs. With the support-verb -ma, verbs may be productively
derived from adjectives (see section 3. 1 .2. 1 ). The SS stem-only dependent form of these
verbs are very frequently used to express manner. (203) and (204) are examples of such verb
forms expressing manner.
   Adverbs do not have a fixed position in the clause. Their position is determined by two
factors. In the first place, Kombai being a verb final language, there is the restriction that the
adverbs occur before the predicate, in the prefield of the clause. Secondly, the semantic
factor that the adverbs tend to occur following or preceding the constituent with which they
are most closely associated semantically.
46   This last factor, positioning reflecting semantic association, is most clearly operative in
the case of the adverbial clitics -khu 'also' and -adi 'only' ; these adverbs cliticise to the
constituents with which they are associated semantically:(205)    Khe-lu-adi       khakhede.
         his-word-only listen. 1 SG.NF
         I listened only to his words.
(206)    Nani-khu        bo-khugi.
         my.mother-also DUR-ill.3SG.NF
         My mother also is ill.
Adverbs which are associated with the predication as a whole occur either in the fIrst position
or pre-verbally. Time adverbs or location adverbs which specify the spatio-temporal
framework within which the event takes place, belong to this group of adverbs which occur
initially or pre-verbally:(207)    Nagu-biiwogo khogade umo-ra                luwano...
         our-parents    formerly speak.S S-and say .3PL.NF
         In former times our parents (forefathers) said...
(208)    Khokhofa       boba      dodo mofene iige.
         a.moment.ago lightning tree that         strike.3SG.NF
         Just a moment ago lightning struck that tree.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56]"
"
4.4 CONCLUSION
   Reesink ( 1 984) calls yesterday and I and a big fire topics in (3 1 1 ) , if on different
grounds:
(3 1 1 )   Yesterday I saw a big fire.
In this chapter we have tried to contribute to the typology of topicality by investigating some
of these ' different grounds' .
   T o grasp these grounds w e should not discuss isolated 'system-sentences' but discourse­
data. In studying spatio-temporal and other framework- specifyi ng sentence-initial
constituents in narratives, we saw that these constituents have two tasks. Their 'forward
looking' task is to present a background or frame for the information to be conveyed in the
present sentence. Their ' backward looking' task is to link the present sentence to the
preceding sentence (local frame) or to the 'organising centre ' of the discourse as a whole
(global frame). Bringing these two elements together we get a notion of frame as a type of
topic which specifies the relevant frame for the predication and which relates the predication
to the preceding one(s).
    In section 3 we have applied this frame-notion to cohesion-phenomena in Kombai
narratives. The relata of Kombai frames in narratives are sentential paragraphs or narrative
sentences. Frames link these sentential paragraphs to each other and to the organising centre
of the narrative as a whole. The organising centre of the Kombai narrative is the time-line,
the events are listed in chronological order. The narrative sentences consist of the frame
followed by the medial chain and the final clause. The medial chain is an often long series of
medial verb clauses, with a low number of expressed arguments per verb. The final clause is
the last clause of the sentence. It contains an independent verb; the medial chain is dependent
on the final clause.
   In Kombai frames are expressed by position and by special frame-constructions. Frames
occur in the left-most position. Typical fillers of the frame slot in Kombai are spatio-temporal
phrases and clauses, as in very many languages all over the world. In addition to these, we
fmd special frame constructions in Kombai, tail-head linkage and generic verb linkage. These
frame-expressing devices are normal in Papuan languages but outside this group they do not
seem to occur with the frequency they have in New Guinea.
   Tail-head linkage is the normal way to connect narrative sentences in Kombai. The verb
of the final clause of the preceding sentence is repeated in the first clause of the next
sentence. When the speaker thinks that a satisfactory frame for his present sentence should
                                                                                           75
contain more infonnation than the repeated verb only, then he may add other material from
the final clause. Tail-head linkage is crucial in processing the information, both for the
production and the perception. The typical intonation associated with tail-head linkage also
reflects this processing function besides being a marker of sentence-boundaries.
   Generic verb linkage and tail-head linkage have the clausal fonn of the recapitulation in
common. The difference is that in generic verb linkage the infonnation is not repeated
verbatim but rather pointed back to, in an anaphoric fashion.
   Connecting sentences by pointing back anaphorically, is of course the more usual way to
create cohesion in the languages of the world. It is the elaborate repetition of the tail-head
linkage, in combination with its high frequency in narratives, which strikes linguists as a
specific characteristic of Papuan languages.

      THE ROLE OF TO 'THING' AND rumu 'PERSON' IN KOMBAI SYNTAX AND PRAGMATICS5 . 1 INTRODUCTION
  In this chapter I shall describe the syntactic and pragmatic functions of two relational
nouns, TO ' thing' and rum u 'person'. They have two functions.
   Syntactically, they function as head nouns (HN) in a number of constructions; there is an
expression-rule of head noun insertion which inserts TO and rumu in relative clauses (RC)
adverbial clauses and question-word phrases.
   Pragmatically, TO and Tum u have a function in the domain of reference and identification.
Adverbial clauses, relative clauses and question-word phrases function as referring
expressions, as terms (using the terminology of Dik 1 978, 1 989). Now when these terms
have TO as HN, they refer to a non-human entity and when they have rumu as HN, they refer
to a human entity. This classificatory function of TO and rum u helps the addressee to identify
the entities the speaker is referring to.
   Ro and rum u are relational head nouns: they belong to a transitional category of
relation ally used lexical items. This category is the bridge in the grammaticalisation process
in which lexical items become functors (purely grammatical elements).
   In section 5.2 the syntactic-pragmatic function of TO and rumu as classificatory HNs is
discussed and in section 5.3 the notion 'relational noun ' is treated in order to understand
certain grammaticalisation processes occurring in Kombai.
   Dik (1985b:3) introduces the notion of 'prototypical expression model ' (PEM). The PEM
for terms is as follows:(i)        a term with a non-derived nominal as head, possibly modified by attributive
         . adjectives and possessor phrases, and determined by one or more term operators
           (Dik 1 985a:3).
Expressions like an old lady, the theory of relativity and John would be examples of
prototypically expressed terms. Notice that the notion of 'term ' is a functional one, and not a
categorial one; terms are expressions, whatever their categorial make-up, which are used by
speakers in the pragmatic and co-operative activity of referring (see Dik 1 978).
  The Kombai preferred expression for terms (ii) follows from the language-independent
PEM (i):
(ii)       ±(modifier/operator+-o) + noun
Here are some examples of Kombai terms which conform to (ii):
                                              76

          uncle's wife
The modifier-head connective -0 (sensitive to vowel-harmony) links the prenominal
modifiers/operators to the head noun (see section 3.8.2. 1 ) .
   Question-word phrases, RCs and adverbial clauses being terms, w e would expect them to
conform to (ii), the preferred expression for terms in Kombai. This is indeed the case: they
are expressed as modifiers of the relational head nouns ro ' thing' and rum u 'person' .
Consider:
(3 1 5)   Yare    gamo khereja bogi-n-o                   rumu. . .

In (3 1 5) we have an RC linked as a modifier to the HN rumu, in (3 1 6) a question-word
linked as a modifier to TO and in (3 1 7) an adverbial clause linked as modifier to TO.","[84, 85, 86, 87]"

                                                62
                                                                                             63
    Of course, it is not for all types of discourse (e.g. social talk) so easy to point out an
organising centre and to find frame constituents linking language expressions to this
organising centre; perhaps we should distinguish between local frames, which merely link
the present sentence to the preceding one and global frames, which link the present sentence
to the organising centre of a larger discourse-fragment or to the discourse as a whole.
   In many texts there are subsections of the discourse which have their own organising
centres. Take for example the following text (from Brown and Yule 1 983: 1 37, somewhat
adapted):
(286)    Mr William Serby
         (a) Mr William Serby who died aged 85 on September 20 was County Treasurer to
             Buckinghamshire County Council from 1 929 to 1 96 1 .
         (b) He was commisioned i n the Queen's (R.W. S urrey Regiment) i n 1 9 1 5 and
             served in France until he was wounded in 1 9 1 6.
         (c) From 1 9 1 7 to 1 9 1 9 he served as a commissioned liaison officer with the French
             and Russian forces in the North Russian Expeditionary Force.
         (d) In 1 926 he was appointed County Accountant to the Cornwall C.c.
         (e) During the Second World war he commanded the Home Guard. . .
         (f) In 1 926 he married Jean Durns and. . .
This obituary (286) h a s two sections, a n introduction (a)-(b) and the main section (c)-(f).
The first section is framed around the speaker's topical entity 'Mr Serby' whereas the main
section has the timeline as its organising centre; in the main section temporal frames link the
sentences to the timeline. In the first section (a)-(b), the speaker's topic, 'Mr Serby' is also
the frame and this shows that the dimensions of framing and topicality may coincide on one
constituent. Below we shall return to the relation between topicality and framing.
   It is important to include the relational nature of frames in the definition of frames, the
relata being the present sentence on the one hand and the organising centre of the discourse
on the other. Thus frames have a forward looking aspect and a backward looking aspect;
forwardly, they present the setting for the predication to come and backwardly, they link the
present sentence to the preceding sentence or discourse.
    This relational character of frames explains why they tend to occur sentence-initially: they
occur in between their relata. The fact that frames tend to occur initially does not mean that
initial constituents are always frames. Sometimes it is the meaning of the sentence as a whole
which allows the addressee to place the sentence in the discourse, rather than one specific
constituent.
   In de Vries ( 1 989:59) I have presented a typology of topicality. Example (287) partly
repeats that representation:
64
                                      ~
 (287)                                topical spans         framing
                        �
                 estab�ishing               maintaining
                   tOPICS                    topics
Discussing sentence (288), Reesink ( 1 984: 1 79) says he would call yesterday and I and a big
fire topics, albeit on different grounds:
(288)    Yesterday I saw a big fIre.
Example (287) is an attempt to formulate a typology of these grounds for topicality.
Yesterday is a frame, I a given topic and a big fire a new topic in terms of this typology. In
de Vries ( 1 989:Ch.3) I have stressed that the distinctions embodied in the taxonomy of
topicality only correspond to pragmatic functions in the grammar of a language as far as the
expressive devices of a language code these distinctions emically in the morpho-syntax of
expressions. Every language has its own patterns of neutralisation and diversifIcation with
respect to these distinctions.
   In the strongest case of neutralisation a language would use the same expressive devices
for all types of topics, irrespective of the grounds for their topicality. Such a language would
distinguish one type of topic (general topic), covering both framing and topical span types of
topics. One level lower in (287), a language would distinguish formally between frames and
topical span related topics. S till lower in (287), a language could distinguish between
establishing topicality (new topic) and maintaining topicality (given topics), etc. For a more
detailed treatment of topical span analysis see de Vries ( 1989:Chapter 3).
    Framing differs from the identifIcation of topical entities in topical spans as follows.
These spans have the aspects of introducing topical entities into the discourse and keeping
track of them. Framing does not have these aspects but has to do with relating the present
sentence to the organising centre of the discourse, for the example the time-line and place-line
in a narrative; frames have a relational character.
   A given frame constituent normally occurs only once whereas it is in the very nature of
topics to have multiple occurrence in discourse, the form in which the occurrences take place
depending on the phase of the topical span.
   In narrative discourses all over the world the spatio-temporal dimension is the unmarked
organising centre, generating temporal and spatial frame phrases, that is, inanimate frames.
At the same time, in narratives animate entities tend to be more prominent entities; thus topics
tend to be animate.
   A constituent may be both topic and frame (cf. 'Mr Serby' in the first section (a)-(b) of
(286)). There are also constituents like in France in (286b) which are neither frame nor topic
(background entities). When in a sentence there is both a topic and a frame, the frame is
positioned before the topic:
(289)    Yesterday (frame) I (topic) was ill.
                                                                                              65
Having discussed the relation hip between frame and topics, we now turn to the
relationship between frames and themes in the sense of Dik ( 1978). Dik ( 1 978: 1 9) defines
themes as constituents which specify ""the universe of discourse with respect to which the
subsequent predication is presented as relevant"" and gives examples like:
(290)    As for Paris, the Eiffel tower is really spectacular.
In (290) as for Paris is the theme; from this and Dik's other examples it IS clear that Dik's
themes also present a frame for the following predication. There are, however, also
differences between our frames and Dik's themes.
   In the first place, the discourse-functionality that I attribute to frames, is absent in Dik's
treatise about theme. Secondly, for Dik ( 1 978) themes are necessarily predication-external
constituents, contrasting with Dik's topics which are always predication-internal. In my view
frames and topics occur both predication-externally and predication-internally and I formulate
the differences between topics and frames more in terms of their different roles in discourse­
cohesion.
   The pragmatic rationale for the predication-externality of both frames and topics in certain
conditions, seems to be processing freedom. The speaker chooses a frame or topic before he
has decided on the form of the subsequent predication. That is why we often find pause­
phenomena with predication-external topics and frames, as Dik ( 1978: 1 36) also notes for his
(always) predication-external themes.
   In Warnbon and Kombai, bu also in Usan (Reesink 1 984), this processing function,
reflected formally by predication-externality and pause-phenomena, is the only difference
between predication-internal and predication-external topics and themes. There are no other
formal or functional differences connected to predication-externality which would justify the
set-up of separate predication-external and predication-internal topics and themes.
   Notice that in the case of predication-external and predication-internal focus in Wambon,
there are other differences involved (see de Vries 1 989:Ch.3); the predication-external focus
was functionally an exclamative and vocative focus and formally expressed by -0 and not by
-nde. These differences led me to set up two functions of focus for Wambon.
   Of course, further typological research is badly needed to see to what extent in Papuan
and other languages predication-externality is connected to other pragmatic a d morpho­
syntactic differences.","[72, 73, 74, 75]"
"
5.2.2 QUESTION-WORD QUESTIONS
   Question-word questions have been described in section 3.6. Here we shall confine
ourselves to the role of ro and rumu in such questions. First some examples:
(328)    Gu narof-o        ro     boferakha ?
         you what-CONN thing DUR.see.2SG.Q
         What are you looking at?
(329)    Gu yaf-o       rumu-n-a-khe?
         you which-CONN person-TR-FOC-Q
         Who are you?
The same grammatical head nouns which function in relative terms, also occur as head nouns
in questioned terms of question-word questions. In (328) ro occurs as the head noun of the
questioned term narnfo ro 'what ' ; in (329) rumu occurs as the head noun of the questioned
term yafo-rumu ' who ' . Questioned terms tend to be expressed according to the preferred
80pattern (ii) for tenns, that is, modifier plus head noun. In most cases, ro and rumu are the
HN in q-tenns but in some cases we find a more specific HN:
(330)     Khe narof-o      lu luwakhe?
          he  what-CONN word say.3SG.NF.Q
          What did he say?
(33 1 )   Narof-o   rei-khe ?
          what-CONN day-Q
          When?
(332)     Narof-o   n-n-a ?
          what-CONN reason-TR-FOC
          Why?
Notice that (330)-(332) still confonn to the preferred modifier plus HN structure. There are
some question-words which do not confonn to the preferred pattern: for example, fenemo
' where' functions as head of the q-tenn; in such cases the head of the q-tenn is not a noun
but a question-word which cannot take modifiers:
(333)     Gu fenemo ba-kha-khe?
          you where DUR-go.2SG.NF-Q
          Where are you going?
The other 'person' nouns from set (323) may also occur in q-tenns:(334)     Mofene yafo mogof-a-khe?
          that     which person-FOC-Q
          Who is that?
Questioned tenns have the focus function and this is optionally expressed by the focus­
marker -a.
   We may conclude that ro and rumu have the same functions in relative clauses and
question word questions; they supply the HN for the preferred tenn-structure (ii) and they
function as classifiers specifying the semantic category of the intended referents, in tenns of
the opposition human entity (rumu) vs. non-human entity (ro).","[89, 90]"
"
5.3.3 Ro: BETWEEN RELATIONAL NOUN AND FUNCTOR
     Compare:
(355)     Gu agarabo mofene yafo rumu adiyanekhe ?
          you thing  that      which person you. will.give.Q
          To whom you will give that thing?
(356)     Gu narof-o         ro    boferakha?
          you what-CONN thing DUR.see.2SG.NF.Q
          What are you looking at?
I have not found ro ' thing' outside the contexts of question-words, RCs and (other)
subordinate clauses. This is different from rumu which functions as a lexical predicate
(kinship term) and as a relational noun. The lexical function or meaning of ' thing' is
expressed by the noun agarabo (e.g. (355» . The grammatical functions of ro have been
described above (section 5.2). Example (356) exemplifies the grammatical function of ro as a
classificatory HN.
   The category 'relationally used lexical item ' in (350) is a tran sitional category; many
languages have functors (e.g. English because which can be shown to have developed from
an earlier relationally used lexical item (English bye cause of>.
   This transitional nature of relationally used lexical items often makes it hard to decide
what the categorial status of a relational noun or verb is. Rumu still seems to function as
noun when used as HN in RCs and question-words: it functions as head of the term phrase
to which the question-word and RC are linked as modifiers by -0, the (obligatory) modifier­
head noun connective. Rumu shows no fonn changes.
   Ro, however, is in the process of losing its noun status and becoming a subordinator.
Indications for this development are the existence of longer and shorter forms, cliticisation­
phenomena and the behaviour of -0.
     Ro is the shorter fonn of rofa. In the following example we find the longer fonn rofa:
                                                                                              89(357)    Kho khumo-ra        bakha-rofa. . .
         man die.SS-and DUR.go.3SG.NF-thing/SUB
         When a man dies and goes away ...
The longer form rofa occurs in one example combined with the causal subordinator -ede
'because':
(358)    Khe-khino rerakhu rof-ode                   feanimadii.
         his-leg     swollen thing/SUB-because he. will.not.go
         Because his legs are swollen, he cannot go.
In (358) rofa and -ede are combined, giving rofode (vowel-elision and vowel-harmony, see
section 2.3). Shortening of the forms of relationally used lexical items may indicate transition
into the functor class. Lexical items each have their own (in Kombai unpredictable) main
word stress but functors tend to be unstressed. The form reduction of relational nouns and
verbs follows this stress-reduction.
    Postpositions/subordinators in Wambon and Kombai cliticise to the last word of the
nominal or clausal term they belong to. Now when shorter forms develop, we also see
cliticisation of the shortened relationally used lexical items, which shows that they are
developing into postpositions (i.e. functors):
(359)    Mil   bokhe-re                        feanimadii.
         rain DUR.be. 3SG.NF-thing/SUB Lshall.not.go
         If it rains, I shall not go.
In (359) ro, the shorter form, has cliticised to the last word of the adverbial clause in a
harrnonised form (re). Notice that the modifier-head connective -0 is absent in (359),
completing the picture of a relational noun becoming a functor expressing subordination.
   In the contexts of question-words, however, the signs that ro develops into a functor are
absent, -0 is obligatory and there is no cliticisation. But there are longer and shorter forms
also in question-words. Sometimes we find narofo rofa instead of narofo 'what'. In Res we
have the same phenomena as in adverbial clauses.
   When ro loses its noun-status in subordinate contexts (Re, adverbial clauses) but not in
question-word questions, we would have a split between ro as a classificatory HN
(relationally used lexical item) in question-words and ro as a marker of subordination.
However, since the signs of ro losing its noun-status in subordinate contexts are still weak, it
seems justified to present a unitary description of ro as a classificatory HN in question­
words, Res and adverbial clauses.","[98, 99]"

5.2 THE GRAMMATICAL RJNCTIONS OF TO AND rumu
5.2 . 1 RELATIVE CLAUSES
    Relative clauses in Kombai are of the double-headed, prenominal type. Consider the
following examples:
(3 1 8)   Gana       gu         fali-kha           TO    na-gana-y-a.
          bush.knife you (SG) carry-go.2SG.NF thing my-bush.knife-TR-PRED
          The bush knife that you took away, is my bush knife.
(3 19)    Yare     gamo khereja bogi-n-o                    rumu na-momof-a.
          old.man join.SS work      DUR.do.3SG. NF-TR-CONN person my-uncle-PRED
          The old man who is joining the work, is my uncle.
Relative clauses generally have two heads, a topical head (yare in ( 3 1 9)) and a grammatical
head (rumu in (3 1 9)). The relative term with its grammatical head (gamo khereja bogino
rum u in (3 19) functions as a restrictive apposition to the topical antecedent (yare in (3 19)).
Thus (3 19) literally has something like, 'the old man, the person who joins the work, is my
uncle ' in which the relative term ('the person who join s the work') presents background
78
information which helps to identify the speaker's topical entity. The relative terms in the data
always seem to function in the domain of topicality but further research is needed to establish
whether relative terms are restricted to these topical contexts.
   Now when in relative terms rum u is used as the grammatical head, the relative term refers
to a human entity and when TO is used the relative term refers to a non-human entity. Most
relative terms have either TO or rumu as heads but in the data we also have examples where
there is no grammatical head noun (e.g. (320» or where the topical antecedent is repeated as
the grammatical head of the relative term (e.g.(32 1 ) . Sometimes, rumu is replaced by
another noun from the set (323) which also plays a role in question-word questions. All the
members of this set mean 'person ' in the contexts of question-word questions and relative
clauses. Rumu is the unmarked choice of this set. (322) is an example of a relative term with
mogo 'person' as its head.
(320)     Baju rakhumade        emukhe.
          shirt buy. l SG.NF lost
          The shirt I bought is lost.

          The sago they gave, is finished.

In the contexts of question-word questions and relative clauses, the nouns of set (323) all
mean ' person' in a generalised sense. The nouns of (323) have their specific lexical
meanings in other contexts. We shall return to the relationship between the lexical meanings
and the grammatical meanings of (323), and of relational nouns in general, in section 5.3. In
(323) all nouns, except khuri 'daughter' , denote male persons. Khuri is used as the syntactic
head of relative terms whose topical antecedents refer to female persons:
(324)     Maria khofade-y-o               khuri, ...
          Mary marry.NF.NEG-TR-CONN female. person
          Mary who was not married, . . .
When there i s no specific topical antecedent, the relative term has a generic interpretation:
(325)     Khe-lu   khakhe-n-o             rum u, . .     .          his-word l isten.3SG.NF-TR-CONN person
          Whoever listens to him, . . .
In (325) the relative term refers to male and female persons; sex is irrelevant and in such
cases rumu, the unmarked choice of the 'person' -set (323) for relative clauses, is used.
                                                                                              79    Within the relative term, ro and rumu have two functions. In the first place, they supply
fillers for the head-slot in the modifier-head structure; the pre-nominal RC is the modifier
linked to its head by the modifier-head linker -0. This modifier-head structure is the preferred
form for the expression of terms (see (ii)).
   In the second place, ro and rumu help the addressee to select the right referent(s) by
classifying entities as either human (rumu) or non-human (ro), as follows: (326)                                    entities
                  persons                                        things
            (human entities; rumu)                        (non-human entities; ro)
    male persons              female persons
      (rumu)                    (khuri)The classification (326) is highly anthropocentric: ro is a negatively defined category: all non­
human entities, animate and inanimate, are classified together. Example (327) is an example
of a ro relative term referring to an animal:(327)    Ai fali-khano         ro     nagu-n-ay-a.
         pig carry-go.3PL.NF thing our-TR-pig-PRED
         The pig they took away, is ours.
A small but significant difference between ro-headed relative terms and rumu-headed relative
terms, is the optionality of the connective -0, which links the modifying RC to the head
noun, with ro and the obligatoriness of the same clitic with rumu. -0 may be used as a
diagnostic for the nounhood of relational nouns: in the modifier-head noun form of terms, -0
is obligatory. We shall return to the categorial status of ro in section 5.3.","[87, 88, 89]"

4.3. 1 .2 SENTENTIAL PARAGRAPHS
   The other relatum of frames is the sentential paragraph. Narratives have the sentential
paragraph as their basic building block. By paragraph I mean a unit of discourse in between
the smallest unit, the single verb clause, and the largest, the narrative as a whole. These
narrative paragraphs have very clearly marked boundaries since the paragraph in Kombai
narratives coincides with a syntactic unit, the sentence.
   These sentences contain medially dependent verb forms and finally independent verb
forms. Independent verb forms may also occur medially and if they do so, they function as
medial D S verbs. Now whenever an independent verb with falling intonation on the last
syllable(s), is followed by a verb form with rising intonation on the last syllable(s), there is a
sentence boundary. In addition to this, frames mark the beginning of a new sentence. frames
are optional but they are present in the great majority of narrative sentences. In most cases,
these frames are expressed by tail-head linkage constructions (see below).
  The combination of intonation, verb types and tail-head linkage makes sentence
boundaries very easy to detect in Kombai narratives.
   Sentences do not only have clear boundaries, they also have very predictable internal
structures, represented by (29 1 ) :
                                                                                                         67
(29 1 )   Sentential paragraph: ±frame±medial chain+final clause
Sentential paragraphs consist of three parts; the first part is the frame constituent, then there
is a middle section of chained single verb clauses and the final part is an independent verb
clause with falling intonation towards the end.","[76, 77]"

Some of the glide phonemes have a low frequency. Therefore the contrastive evidence for

2.3 SYLLABLES, WORDS, MORPHOPHONEMICS
     There is one syllable-type: (C)V. Examples:
(13)      a               house
( 1 4)    nu              I
The canonical word form is:
( 1 5)    (C)V.(CV)O-9
Some examples:
( 1 6)    v                        o               water
          CV                      nu               I
          CV.CV                   momo             uncle
          V.CV                    akhu             type of vegetables
          CV.CV.CV.CV             rakhumofe        I shall buy
The canonical form ( 1 5) implies the absence of VV and CC clusters (the grapheme kh
represents a single sound, cf. section 2.2). Furthermore that consonants do not occur finally
and that vowel syllables may only occur initially.
   A number of morphophonemic processes can be understood as rules preserving the
pattern ( 1 5).
  In the first place there is the morphophonemic process deleting word-final consonants.
Compare ( 17 ) and ( 1 8):
( 17 )    momof- o     Iii
          uncle-CONN wife
          uncle's wife
( 1 8)    Momo bome.
          uncle DUR.come.3SG.NF
          Uncle is coming.
In ( 1 8) the final consonant of momof'uncle' is deleted. In ( 17 ) this final f of the word
momofhas been retained before the connective clitic -0. Compare also ( 1 9)-(20) and (2 1 )­
(22):
( 1 9)     na-Ian-o        momo
           my-wife-CONN uncle
           my wife's uncle
(20)       na-lii
           my-wife
           my wife
                                                                                            11(21)     e
         bird
         bird
(22)     el-o           lu
         bird-CONN voice
         the voice of the bird
In (20) the final In! of Ian has been deleted; in (22) the final N of el 'bird'.
  Another rule to preserve the canonical form ( 1 5) is nasal insertion: whenever, because of
morpheme clustering, a V V sequence results, an In! is inserted in between the two vowels:
(23)     a            house
(24)     na-          my
(25)     na-n-a
         my-TR-house
         my house
(26)     na-n-ai
         my-TR-pig
         my pig
Occasionally, we find a transitional y between vowels:
(27)     Dare-y-a.
         grandfather-TR-PRED
         It is grandfather.
When the two vowels are the same, we sometimes find vowel elision instead of nasal
insertion:
(28)     na-          my
(29)     are          father
(30)     n-are
         my-father
         my father
Notice that in (2 5) and (26) there is nasal insertion and not elision. Nasal insertion is the
unmarked solution to V V clusters, with an overwhelming frequency compared to y insertion.
   There are some other morphophonemic rules, not connected with preserving the pattern
(15), which should also be mentioned here.
   The most important assimilation rule in Kombai is vowel-harmony. Compare (31)-(33):
(31)     e1-0           lu
         bird-CONN voice
         the voice of the bird
(32)     khof-a         kha
         man-CONN skin
         the skin of a human
12(33)      nuwayof-e          idi
          cassowary-CONN egg
          the egg of a cassowary
    The connective -0 (see section 3.8.2.1) harmonises across the word boundary with the
fIrst vowel of the head noun with which the connective links pre-nominal modifiers. This
harmonisation is optional. For example in (17) the connective has not been harmonised.
When the head noun has a front vowel in the fIrst syllable the connective appears as -e (e.g.
(33)), with a back vowel in the fIrst syllable as -0, and with a central vowel in the first
syllable as -a (e.g. (32».
     With the durative prefIx bo- we see vowel-harmony along the same lines:(34)      Bo-ne-de.
          DUR-eat-1SG.NF
          I am eating.
(35)      Ba-kha-de.
          DUR-go-1SG.NF
          I am going.
(36)      Be-ri-de.
          DUR-make-1SG.NF
          I am making.
In (34) vowel-harmony has not taken place: the durative prefIx has its basic form bo-; in (35)
there is ba- before the central vowel of the verb stem and in (36) be- before the front vowel
of the verb stem.
   In some cases, with the back vowel lui, there is harmonisation to lui instead of 10/. Thus
the support-verb -ma is harmonised to -rna in (37), the normal assimilation in the context of
back vowels, but in (38) there is complete harmonisation to the lui of the preceding stem.
(37)      Fum-rna       kha.
          good-SUPP.SS go.3SG.NF
          He went well.
(38)      Agu-rnu         kha.
          slow-SUPP.SS go.3SG.NF
          He went slowly.
  A last major morphophonemic process is the change from Ix! to f'Jg! after nasal vowels.
Compare (39) and (40):
(39)      ;mbu-xel
          lazy-ADJ
          lazy
(40)      ;mb6-lJge/
          decayed-ADJ
          decayed
Since f'Jg! is a pre-nasalised phoneme and 161 a nasal vowel, the change in (40) is a type of
nasal assimilation. I-xel is an adjectival suffix (see section 3.4).
                                                                                   13  We have now discussed final consonant deletion, transitional nasal insertion, vowel­
hannony and nasal assimilation. There are a number of minor morphophonemic changes.
These will be indicated in the morphology section when they occur in the examples.
                                                  CHAPTER 3                                       KOMBAI WORD CLASSES   This chapter gives an outline of the morphology of Kombai. Each section discusses a
word category that seems relevant to Kombai grammar. The word categories are first
characterised in terms of where and how they function in phrases and clauses and/or in terms
of the morphological categories they express. Following this characterisation, derivational
processes, if any, are treated. Finally, there is a discussion of the inflectional aspects.","[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

3.8.3. 1 .2 Nage
  Nage is a postposition expressing semantic functions like instrument and circumstance.
The relations expressed by nage have in common that they concern inanimate entities which
52
p�ay a role as peripheral circumstances of the event. Nage does not express spatio-temporal
CIrcumstances.
(237)     Yafu nage khano.
          canoe by    go. 3PL.NF
          They went by canoe.
(238)     Yagu nage khuro          unone.
          arrow with each. other kil1. 3PL.F
          They will kill each other with arrows.
(239)     Gom-a          nage ba-ra-de.

          I am defecating with blood.

          their-heart-CONN in       think.3PL.NF
          In their hearts they thought . . .
Sometimes the modifier-head connective - 0 links the noun to nage (e.g. (240) and (24 1 » and
this suggests that nage could be a relational noun and not a postpositional relator. On the
other hand the generalised grammatical meaning of nage and the absence of -0 in a
considerable number of cases indicate that nage is developing into a relator. Notice that we
have not yet found nage used as a non-relational noun . The original lexically specific
meaning of nage we do not know.
   The semantic relation instrument is also often expressed by the relational use of the verb
Jefa- 'to take ':
(242)     Nu gana           lefa-ra       kwayi-khal08 roumade.
          I     bush.knife take.SS-and spirit-grass    cut. l S G.NF
          I cut the grass with a bush knife.

          I    spirit-key    take.SS-and door open . 1 SG.NF
          I opened the door with the key.","[61, 62]"
"   In the first place, it expresses the frame function; the recapitulated information of the
frame clause (the 'head' of the tail-head linkage is the frame-constituent) serves as the setting
for the new information, as the given 13 frame for the information to come. At the same time,
the frame links the event-chain of the present sentential paragraph to the list of events that
makes up the narrative.
    In the second place, tail-head linkage serves a processing function. Since the medial chain
and the final clause often contain many verbs denoting new events with most of the
predictable arguments of these verbs unexpressed, the information-rate in the sentential
paragraph is high. Now at the start of a new sentential paragraph, the recapitulation of the
tail-head linkage gives the speaker the time to process the coming medial chain and the
addressee to process the information given in the preceding medial chain. By tail-head
linkage the flow of information is slowed down in between two sentential paragraphs. This
processing function manifests itself very clearly in pause-phenomena and intonation-contours
associated with tail-head linkage. The frame clause of the tail-head linkage is pronounced
much slower than the medial chain and the fmal clause; at the end of the frame clause, there is
a rising intonation, contrasting with the falling intonation of the preceding final clause.
Between the frame and the medial chain we often find pauses and hesitation-phenomena.
   In the third place, tail-head linkage carries over the switch-reference monitoring of
subjects from one sentential paragraph to the next. In Kombai, switch-reference plays an
important role in maintaining topics within topical spans, j ust as in Wambon (see de Vries
1 985) but the influence of topicality factors on the switch-reference system is much less than
in Wambon; 'skipping' of non-topical subjects for example, so frequent in Wambon does not
seem to occur on the same scale as in Wambon. Of course, the notion subject should be
taken as first argument (e.g. agents with action verbs). Much more research is needed to
assess the various semantic and pragmatic factors involved in switch-reference in Kombai.
Reesink ( 1 983a) and Roberts ( 1 988a, 1 988b) have shown that it is impossible to describe
switch-reference systems in most Papuan languages as a purely syntactic device.
    Van Kleef ( 1988 : 1 55) correctly points out that the use of tail-head linkage differs from
language to language. Nevertheless, the three functions of tail-head linkage in Kombai
(framing, management of information flow and carrying switch-reference monitoring over
sentence- or paragraph-boundaries) might quite possibly be relevant in some form in many
Papuan languages. The use of tail-head linkage in S iroi for the management of the
information flow may serve to exemplify this. Van Kleef ( 1 988 : 1 52) observes a relation
between the use of tail-head linkage and management of the information flow in Siroi, a
TGNP language of the Kabenau family of Papua New Guinea. Tail-head linkage in Siroi is a
sentence-connecting device mainly used within thematic paragraphs in narratives for
highlighting the main events (expressed by the final verbs in this language). This tail-head
recapitulation of the final verbs is done ""very consistently by most narrators throughout the
whole narrative with the exception of the climax of the story when usually there is a lot of
13   The 'given frame' nature of the recapitulated clause is expressed by demonstrative-based markers of
     'givenness' in some Papuan languages, for example, in Urim tail-head linkage (Hemmill1 1989:5 1).
                                                                                                           71direct speech and the infonnation flow i s extremely high. When that i s the case, Tail-Head
linkage is sometimes not used lest it would stop the flow of events"" (Van Kleef 1 988 : 1 52).
Although the (optional) absence of tail-head linkage in the climax of the Siroi narrative may
be a special Siroi phenomenon, the reason for this absence points to the general function of
tail-head linkage in managing the infonnation flow.
   According to Foley ( 1 986:20 1 ), in most Papuan languages tail-head linkage is done by
subordinate recapitulatory clauses. In Kombai and Wambon, however, the nonnal way to
express tail-head linkage is by coordinate-dependent clauses. In Kombai and Wambon ,
switch-reference is restricted to coordinate clauses. By using coordinate structures for tail­
head linkage, the switch-reference monitoring of subjects is carried over sentence­
boundaries: the repeated verb occurs in a coordinate-dependent clause and accordingly
expresses switch-reference. The last verb of the preceding sentence, being an independent
fonn, does not express switch-reference but its recapitulated fonn in the frame clause does
express switch-reference.
   In lrianese Indonesian, at least as it is spoken in the area where I have worked (see
Chapter 1 ), tail-head linkage also occurs, often in combination with the Irianese Indonesian
coordinator/sequence marker baru:
(297)     Kemarin      saya lihat babi hutan.
          yesterday I     see pig jungle
          Yesterday I saw a wild pig.
(298)     LiMt ...... baru saya mau bunuhnya.
          see          and I      want kill.it
          I saw it and I wanted to kill it.
Since this type of sentence linkage does not occur in Standard Indonesian, at least not with
the very high frequency it has in Irianese Indonesian, it seems safe to conclude that the
frequent use of tail-head linkage in Irianese Indonesian is one of the many signs of the
intense interaction of Papuan languages and varieties of Indonesian in Irian Jaya. 14
   I shall now illustrate the three functions of tail-head linkage (in framing, processing
infonnation, switch-reference) with examples from the following discourse-chunk (which is
a part of text 5 in Chapter 7).:
(299)     .. kepalahansife-n-a mene boyademano.
              .              headman-TR-house TOP DUR.meet.3PL.NF
          ... they held a meeting in the house of the headman.

          They held a meeting and the wife of the headman started to speak angrily against her
          husband.","[80, 81]"
"    (228)     Kombai:
              Kho khenoduf-o khale abo-n-o           rumu. . .
              man  child-CONN like be.3SG.NF-TR-CONN person
              A man who is like a child, . . .
    Literally (228) says 'the resemblance of a child' . I n (224)-(225) khale does not have this
    specific lexical content of 'resemblance ' but a general grammatical meaning of inclusive
    disj unction ( ' or'). Thus semantically (criterion a. of (226)) khale has developed a
    conjunction-like grammatical meaning. Syntactically (criterion b. of (226)), a diagnostic for
    the noun-hood of relational nouns in Awyu-Ianguages is the presence or absence of modifier­
    head connectives. In the case of khale, -0 is sometimes present and sometimes absent. Again
    this points to the loss of noun-hood since -0 is an obligatory modifier-head noun linker in
    noun phrases. The fact that -0 is sometimes still there points to the transitory state of khale
    between relational noun and relator. Accordingly, there are not yet formal changes typical for
    relators. Since content items tend to get main word stress whereas relators do not receive this
    stress, relators tend to be reduced to shorter forms (criterion c. of (226)).
       The connective -0 not only functions as a modifier-head connective within noun phrases
    but also as an inclusive non-exhaustive enumerator, with the same meaning as khale:
    (229)     Ay-o       duwoy-o riil-o            e1-0        nage
              pig-orland fish-or/and banana-and/or bird-and/or you

5.3 RELATIONAL NOUNS AND GRAMMATICALISATION
5.3. 1 INTRODUCTION
   Thus far I have taken the notion 'relational noun' for granted. Now I shall examine the
assumptions related to that notion.
   In the first place, I assume a fundamental distinction between two types of stems in
language. The lexicon stores the basic contentive elements, nominal, verbal and adjectival
predicates. The expression-rules specify grammatical or fonn e      , lements used to express
functions (e.g. subject, focus, agent) and operators (definiteness, tense). These grammatical
elements (conjunctions, demonstratives, tense-suffixes, etc.) are opposed to lexical elements
(see also Watters 1985:92).
    Secondly, within the domain of grammatical elements, I assume a distinction between
relationally or grammatically used lexical items and purely grammatical elements or functors.
   Relational nouns and verbs retain their categorial status as noun or verb. Functors may be
subdivided categorially into categories of functors, demonstratives, tense-markers, etc.
according to distributional criteria.
   Relational nouns are grammatical elements, specified by the expression-rules (see (350))
but they stay nouns and this categorial status enables them to function as heads of tenn
phrases. However, having grammatical functions, they tend to lose their categorial status of
noun and become members of one of the functor categories. In this process of category­
change, relational nouns lose the noun function of being head of the tenn phrase. This
function change is then followed by fonn changes, like shortening and cliticisation. A
specific Awyu-family diagnostic for nounhood of relational nouns is the behaviour of the
modifier-head noun linker -0 (see section 3.8.2. 1 ). When a relational noun becomes functor,
-0 becomes optional first and is then lost altogether.",[96]

6.4.2 PREFIELD COMPLEXITY IN A RIGID VERB-FINAL LANGUAGE
    The second factor which may help to explain the importance of direct quotation in Kombai
is a syntactic one and has to do with constituent ordering tendencies in language.
    Kombai is a rigidly verb-flnal language with the basic functional pattern S 0 V. Now
subordinate clauses are complex constituents syntactically (Dik 1978:204-212) and several
supposedly universal tendencies conspire to remove these complex constituents from the pre­
verbal area of the clause (prefleld) and position them after the verb (in the postfleld). For
example, the Prefleld Complexity Principle formulated by Dik ( 1989: 50): ""The Prefleld is
universally less hospitable to complex material than the Postfleld; Prefleld languages may
thus be expected to possess strategies for relieving the Prefleld of excessive complexity."".
Another tendency is that ""Other things being equal, constituents prefer to be placed in order
of increasing complexity"" (Dik 1989 :35 1).
   Thus subordinate clauses in a rigid verb-flnal language like Kombai are subjected to
conflicting ordering pressures. On the one hand the language tends to adhere to its basic
functional pattern with the predicate (whether verbal or nominal) in flnal position. On the
                                                                                           101other hand, the aforementioned tendencies put pressure on the pre-verbal complex constituent
to move to the area after the verb.
   There is no problem for topical subordinate clauses in Kombai. They go to the special
clause-initial position (P I in the terminology of Dik 1 989), reserved, inter alia, for
constituents with topical functions. This position is insensitive to complexity-pressures (Dik:
1 978 :204). Focus-clauses do not go to PI in Kombai; their focality is expressed by the
focus-clitic -a on the relational headnoun (see section 3.8.3.2. 1).
   But not all subordinate clauses are topical in Kombai (see section 5.2.3.3). An important
class of non-topical subordinate clauses are the second argument-clauses of verbs of
speaking, thinking and wanting and of perception-verbs ('to see', 'to hear').
    It follows from the ordering theory of Dik: ( 1989) that Kombai should possess strategies
to solve the conflict of verb-finality and pre-verbal complexity. One solution would be to
reduce the complexity of pre-verbal subordinate clauses, instead of postponing them. As in
the majority of rigid verb-final languages (Dik: 1989:378), the Kombai strategy of reduction
is to give pre-verbal embedded clauses a nominalised form. Consider (398) and (399):
(398)   Nu lcha-n-o          biduma-de.
        I  go.INF.NF-TR-CONN refuse-ISG.NF
         I do not want to go.
(399)    Ya    uwa     rakhuma-no     ro    emuma-no.
        they money pay-3PL.NF thing forget-3PL.NF
        They forgot to pay.
The examples (398) and (399) represent the two forms that embedded pre-verbal clauses take
in Kombai. The first (such as in (398)) is with a nominal infinitive linked by the prefield­
centre connective -0 to its head, the verb of the superordinate clause. The second and more
usual form is to express the subordinate clause as a relative clause modifier of a relational
head noun, the two most common head nouns being ro 'thing' and rumu 'person' (cf.
Chapter 5). Thus (cf. (399)) embedded clauses take the form of noun phrases containing
relative clauses. Noun phrases are less complex than fully verbal embedded clauses (Dik
1989:3 5 1 ).
    However, nominalised non-topical clauses (such as (398) and (399)) are relatively
infrequent and this is because Kombai prefers two other strategies, direct quotation and co­
subordination. These two strategies give the complex constituent a non-embedded syntactic
status so that it is no longer a constituent of the superordinate clause.
  Let us limit our attention to clausal second arguments ('object clauses'). The great
majority of these clauses are expressed by direct quotation and/or co-subordination.
   Verbs of speaking use direct quotation for their clausal second arguments:
(400)    Khe luwa            riga   yademo-nane-ne.
        he say.3SG.NF stone collect-IMP.PL-QUOTE.SG
        He told them to collect stones.
Direct quotation-clauses are deictically not integrated in the clause of the quotation-margin
and syntactically only very partially. Therefore, for example, in (400) it is no problem that
the clausal second argument of luwa occurs after the verb. The speech act verbs preceding
and following the quotation merely 'bracket off' that constituent from the quotation-margin.
102Direct quotations allow for highly complex material (cf. (370) above). We have seen that
direct quotation is by no means restricted to reported speech but also occurs with 'think' and
'want' .
    Co-subordination also gives the complex constituent (pre-verbal embedded clause) an
independent syntactic status, but in a different way. The term ""co-subordination"" (Olson
1 98 1 ) refers to the combination of dependence and non-embeddedness which characterises
the relationship between medial and final clauses in Papuan languages. (See Foley and Van
Valin 1984:24 1 -242, 256-263 for detailed treatment of co-subordination.)
   Co-subordination is used for the second argument-clauses of many verbs, for example for
perception-verbs:
(401 )   Nu fera-def-a              khe bo-me.
         I see-lSG.NF-DS.and he          DUR-come.3SG.NF
         I saw him come.
The example (401 ) could be paraphrased as: 'I saw and he was coming' , to give the reader a
rough idea of co-subordinate clause-linkage, but the purely coordinate rendering with 'and'
fails to indicate the type of dependency between the two clauses of (401 ) although it succeeds
in rendering the non-embedded nature of the relationship. The dependency of medial clauses
on the following final clause (independent clause) has to do with tense-mood and person­
number interpretation of the verb of the medial clause (these depending in varying degrees on
the verb of the final clause) and with switch-reference relations between medial and final
clauses. The different subject form feradefa 'I saw and different subject following' cannot
stand on its own.
   In Telefol (Healey 1964:28-29) perception verbs like 'to see' take quotative clauses to
express the perceived event. However, the use of quotative clauses with perception verbs
contrasts with the other uses of quotative clauses in Telefol (Healey 1964 distinguishes four
types of quotative clauses, that is, saying, desiderative, direct imperative and naming). In
perception contexts the quotation marker kalaa appears which does not occur with the other
types of quotative clauses.
   For reasons of available space we cannot elaborate here on co-subordination and we shall
limit our attention to the aspect of complexity. The combination of non-embeddedness and
dependency makes co-subordination ideally suited for solving the problem of verb-finality
and pre-verbal complexity. The complex constituent (e.g. the clausal second argument khe
bome in (40 1 )) occurs after the verb of perception but its independent syntactic status as a
final clause prevents violation of the SOV pattern: it is not a constituent of the preceding
medial clause. With some verbs, both the quotation and the co-subordination strategy may be
used (compare e.g. (388) and (391)) but usually either direct quotation (e.g. Jumma- 'to
promise') or co-subordination (e.g. fera- 'to see') is used for the second argument.
   There are a few cases in the data where certain verbs of speaking (Juwa- 'to say, speak' ,
ja- 'to call ') have their second argument-clauses expressed by co-subordination and not by
direct quotation. The verbs of speaking have direct causative meanings which they do not
have when direct quotation is used:
(402)    Nu bo-Juwa-na-n-a                     ai   ii-de.
         me  DUR-say-3PL.NF-TR-DS.and pig kill-ISG.NF
         They forced me to kill the pig.
                                                                                           1 03
(403)    Luwa            riga yademo-nane-ne.
         say. 3 S G . NF stone collect-IMP.PL-QUOTE.SG
         He told (them) to collect stones.
(404)     Ya ja-na-n-a                nagu me-defo.
         they call-3PL.NF-TR-DS.and we     come-IPL.NF
         We came on their invitation.
The examples (402) and (404) show the causative meaning appearing in co-subordinate
environments with certain verbs of speaking. Luwa in (403) is non-causative and non­
factive: the speaker of (403) does not suppose that the collecting indeed took place whereas
in (402) and (404) the factuality of the killing and the coming is presupposed. Notice that the
factive presuppositions of (402) and (404) follow from the causative meaning of the verbs of
speaking in co-subordinate environments and not from the co-subordinate pattern in se. The
example (392) shows that co-subordinate structures expressing clausal second arguments
may carry non-factive presuppositions.
   More research is needed to establish whether the use of co-subordination with verbs of
speaking always implies causative meanings. But it is clear that co-subordination and direct
quotation cannot be simply viewed as interchangeable strategies. They share, however, one
important feature: they give complex constituents of clausal form a non-embedded status and
in doing so help to solve the conflict between pre-verbal (prefield) complexity and verb­
finality.","[110, 111, 112, 113]"

3.8 .3.2.2 NEW TOPIC AND FRAME
  Like in Wambon (de Vries 1 989), Urim (Hemrnila 1 989), Asmat (Voorhoeve 1965 : 1 53),
Usan (Reesink 1 9 84) and in other Papuan languages (Ree sink 1 9 8 4 : 1 9 8 , 1 99)
demonstratives play an important role in expressing topicality in Kombai.9
9     In the languages mentioned here demonstratives also function as topic markers. In Telefol (Healey
      1 965b:25,33) there is a topic marker ise used for ""something recently referred to in the discourse or
      conversation, 'the thing that we have been talking about'."" This ise is of demonstrative origin (Healey
                                                                                                            55
   The speaker-related demonstrative mene 'this' is secondarily used in establishing and re­
establishing the speaker's topic (new topic, 'this is the entity I want to speak about') and in
expressing the frame function ( ' given that. . . '), another topical pragmatic function (see
Chapter 4). To maintain the speaker's topical entities (given topic), other devices, especially
verb morphology are used.
     Some examples of mene as new topic/frame marker:
(255)      Gu mene nadiimokh-a.
           you TOP my.beloved-PRED
           You are my beloved.
(256)      Gu gwari m uno gu ugi-ro
           you snake Patola you bite. 3SG.NF-SUB
           mene gu fe-khumalene-madii.
           FRM you NEG-die.2SG.F-NEG
           If a Patola snake has bitten you, you will not die.
In (256) the conditional clause is the frame, marked by the subordinator ro and the Frame
marker mene. In Chapter 5 the topicality of adverbial subordinate clauses is discussed.
     In (258) mene is used to re-establish a topic that was introduced in (257):
(257)      Kepalahansifel O khorabo maro-fo-ra
           headman          wife    go.up.SS-SEQ-and
           khe-yale      bo-luwa.
           her-husband DUR-speak.against.3SG.NF
           The wife of the headman spoke angrily against her husband.
(258)      Bo-luwa-n-a                            kepalahansife
           DUR-speak.against.3SG .NF-TR-CONN(DS ) headman
           marofora             khe-khorabo mene iifa.
           go.up. S S .S EQ.and his-wife      TOP hit.3SG.NF
           She spoke angrily against him and then the headman started to hit his wife.
The topic khekhorabo ' his wife' is re-established by mene in (258). Voorhoeve ( 1 965 : 1 53)
has described similar discourse functions for the Asmat speaker-related demonstrative alar
which is also used 'when something is mentioned which has already been spoken of, or is
presumed to be known to the listener' . This same discourse function (to mark givenness) is
observed by HemmiHi ( 1 989) for demonstrative pa 'that/there ' in Urim (Torricelli Phylum,
East Sepik) when it goes with noun phrases. Interestingly, pa in this capacity only marks
textual given ness, not situational givenness or shared background givenness (Hemmilii
1 98 9 : 62). Apart from marking textual givenness (previous mentioning), pa is used to
introduce new topics into the discourse and to mark emphasis and contrast (focal functions).
      1965b glosses it as 'this') but seems to develop into a specialised topic marker. As such it can co-occur
      with the demonstrative -kaa 'this'.
10    KepaJahansife is based on the Indonesian term kepaJa hansip which term refers to a government
      appointed member of the community who is responsible for the maintaining of order in the village
      (hansip is short for tahanan sipil).
56
3.8.4 RELATORS IN SUBORDINATE AND COORDINATE CLAUSES   Subordinate clauses function as constituents of other clauses, the main clauses. Co­
ordination in the Papuan context generally involves the chaining of coordinate-dependent
clauses (medial clauses) and this is also the case in Kombai.
   Apart from subordinate and medial (coordinate-dependent) clauses there is a third type of
clause in Kombai, the final or independent clause. Example (259) shows the distribution of
dependent and independent verb forms over the clause types in Kombai: (259)                          Kombai clauses
                     final          medial             subordinate                                   /\
                                  SS       DSI
                                             I
                   indep v      dep v    indep v         indep vWhen independent verb forms are used in medial-coordinate clauses, they indicate DS
following. Thus medially the finite versus non-finite distinction expresses the DS versus S S
opposition.","[64, 65, 66]"
"
6.2 REpORTED SPEECH
   Kombai has two interesting features in the domain of reported speech. First, an extreme
preference for direct quotation; second, the obligatory use of direct quotations not only when
                                              91
92assertions are reported but also when other types of speech acts are reported (praise,
promise, warn, ask, etc.). 1 5
   As far as the preference for direct quotation is concerned, I have, in fact, thusfar not
found any examples of indirect quotation. Since this may be due to incomplete data, it seems
safer for the moment to use the phrase 'extreme preference for direct discourse' . But there is
a distinct possibility that Kombai does not distinguish between direct and indirect discourse.
Drabbe ( 1 959:23 , 1 37) claims that Kaeti and Wambon do not have indirect forms of
quotation. Kombai is related to Wambon: they all belong to the Awyu-Ndumut family.
      The absence of indirect discourse in Kombai would follow naturally from the tendency in
Papuan languages to prefer direct discourse. Lower Grand Valley Dani, for example, has
indirect forms but ""Dani speakers show a distinct preference for direct quotation"" (Bromley
198 1 :27 1 ). Wilson ( 1988:46) states that Yali, also a Dani-family language, does not have
indirect discourse. Healey ( 1 964:29) writes about Telefol, in which language quotative
constructions are used in the domains of reported speech, reported thought and perception:
"" ... the whole class of clauses has been termed Quotative because all must be regarded as a
kind of 'direct speech' - or 'direct cerebration'."".
    The second interesting point is the obligatory use of direct quotations with all speech act
verbs, not just with 'to say' . This feature is also found in other Papuan languages. Larson
( 1984) gives examples for Western Dani of the use of direct quotation with the following
speech act types: testify, tell, invite, call, say, speak, command, consent, inquire.
     Consider the following Kombai examples:
(360)      Khe luwa                 riga    yademo-nane-ne.
           he    say.3 SG.NF stone collect-IMP.PL-QUOTE.SG
           He told them to collect stones.
(361 )     Nu yaboma-def-e-ne.
           I  be.ill-lSG.NF-CONN-QUOTE.SG
           He said he was ill.
(362)      Nu wamedefe-ne         luwa.
           I  come.lSG.F-QUOTE.SG say.3SG.NF
           He promised to come.
(363)      Nu luwofera-de gu gama ade-n-e                    khogona-n-e-ne.
           I    ask-lSG.NF you join SS eat-TR-2SG.F allright-TR-CONN-QUOTE.SG
           I asked him to eat with us and he accepted the invitation.
The example (360) is a reported command, (36 1 ) a reported assertion, (362) a reported
promise and in (363) an invitation and its response are reported.
15
      Following Dooley ( 1989), we shall define (in)direct discourse in terms of deictic orientation and not in
      terms of verbatim versus adapted modes of reporting. Direct quotation-forms have all their deictic
      elements oriented immediately in Kombai, that is, oriented towards the utterance-situation of the
      reported and not of the reporting speech act. The deictic definiton works better for Kombai since. in the
      absence of the distinction direct versus indirect discourse, the use of direct forms does not imply
      anything about the attempts of the speaker to report verbatim. Also following Dooley (1989:45). we
      shall use the term 'quotation' for the quoted utterance(s). and 'quotation-margin' for the constituents in
      the reported speech constructions which describe the encoding situation, the cicumstances under which
      the quoted utterance(s) was (were) uttered; in John said to Harry: you are ill the quotation-margin is John
      said to Harry and the quotation is you are ill. The present tense and the second person pronoun you
      show the immediate deictic orientation of the quotation.
                                                                                              93    Clues as to the type of speech act can be found in both the quotation and in the quotation­
margin. For example in (360), the imperative mood of the verb in the quotation is a clue to
the command-nature of the reported speech act. Clues in the quotation-margin include the use
of specific speech act verbs, often in combination with the generic speech act verb luwa- 'to
say, to speak'. The generic speech act verb may also occur on its own (e.g. in the promise of
(362)). Generic and specific speech act verbs may both precede and follow the quotation.
Quite often they occur both in the right and in the left quotation-margin, as in (364):
(364)    Khe ludima                wamedefe-ne                 luwa.
         he promise.3SG.NF come.lSG.F-QUOTE.SG say.3SG.NF
         He promised to come.
Speech act verbs and quotation-markers may also occur interspersed in the quotation,
especially in long quotations. (e.g. (370)).
   The content of the quotation in (365), together with the verb luwa- 'to say' , identifies the
reported speech act as an act of praise:
(365)    Wa-Iuwa-no           kho mofena yaferabo-n-e-neno.
         COM-say-3PL.NF man that             very. good-TR-CONN-QUOTE.PL
         They praised that man.
   Healey ( 1964:30) gives similar examples of various speech act types in Telefol expressed
by 'to say' plus direct quotations: '''He agreed. ' (""'Yes"", he said.'). 'He refused.' (""'No"",
he said. '). ' He thanked (him).' ('''Thanks'', he said. ')"".
   Speech act verbs have their second arguments obligatorily expressed by direct quotations:
direct quotations have been grammaticalised with speech act verbs. Thus John promised me
bananas must be expressed as John promised (said): '[ shall give you bananas' and John
praised me as John said: 'You are good'. Notice that the use of direct quotation in Kombai
does not imply verbatim quotation. When the encoding situation is very clear from the
context, the quotation-marker may be the only element of the quotation-margin (e.g. (361 )).
When the quotation-margin is deliberately left unspecified and the encoding situation of the
utterance cannot be inferred from the context, the quotation-marker becomes an evidential
suffix. Compare:
(366)    Ai   kh wui lefa.
         pig theft do.3SG.NF
         He stole a pig.
(367)    Ai khwui lefa-nene.
         pig theft do.3SG.NF-QUOTE.PL
         He stole a pig (hearsay).
The addition of -nene in (367) indicates that the speaker wants to make clear that what he
says is not based on his own observation. Evidential use of quotation-markers also occurs in
other Papuan languages, for example Asmat (Voorhoeve 1 965: 176) and Dani (Bromley
1 98 1 ) .
   The usual order of constituents in reported speech-constructions i s as follows: (i)
identification of quoted speaker(s), (ii) generic and/or specific speech act verb, (iii) quoted
utterance(s), (iv) cliticised quotation-marker -ne (or one of its allomorphs), (v) generic and/or
specific speech act verb. The only obligatory constituent is the quotation (the quoted
94utterance(s)). When the quotative nature of the quoted clause(s) is very clear from the
context, the quotation-marker may be left out (e.g. (393) below) but this is rare.
   The direct quotation is deictically not integrated in the clause of the quotation-margin. For
example, the quoted speaker of (364) is identified in the quotation by the first person form of
the verb but in the quotation-margin by the third person pronoun khe ' he' showing that
quotation and quotation-margin have different deictic centres. The quotation has the form of
an independent clause and is syntactically non-embedded. The quotation-marker and the
speech act verbs optionally preceding and following the quotation bracket off the quotation
from the quotation-margin. However, when the quotation is left out, the remaining clause­
structure is incomplete since the quotation expresses the clausal second argument of the
speech act verb in the quotation-margin.
   The quotation-marker -ne has the following allomorphs: -ne, -neno, -nene and -nera. The
forms -ne and -neno express the opposition singular versus plural; -nene is a variant form of
-neno in which vowel-harmony has taken place. Compare:
(368)    Khogona-n-e-ne.
         allright-TR-CONN-QUOTE.SG
         He consented.
(369)    Khogona-n-e-neno.
         allright-TR-CONN-QUOTE.PL
         They consented.
The -n- in (368)-(369) is a transitional sound. The connective -e will be discussed below.
   The allomorph -nero optionally replaces -ne and -neno but only sentence-medially; it
consists of -ne and the same subject medial verb conjunction -ra (see section 3.1.3.2.2). The
forms -ne/-neno may occur both medially and finally. Since -ne is sometimes used in plural
contexts (e.g. (370)) but -neno never in singular contexts, -ne is the basic allomorph (widest
distribution). Consider (370):

         The adults use to warn us, ""Children, if you eat forbidden meat, you will stay little,
         the Muno snake, the Fuwo rat, the Yami rat, if you eat those forbidden kinds of
         meat, you will not grow up"".
                                                                                                          95The allomorphs of -ne point to its verbal origin. In some other Awyu-family languages the
cognates of -ne function fully as verbs of speaking. The verb ne (secondary stem nende-) 'to
say' occurs in Mandobo (Drabbe 1 959:23) in the right margin of quotations, with the
connective -0 optionally linking the quotation to the verb of speaking:
(37 1 )   Wagarew-o ne-gen.
          bad-CONN say-3SG.PRES
          ""It is bad"", he said.
(372)     Mendanog-o                  nende-ran.
          come.IMP.SG-CONN say-3SG.PAST
          He told him to come.
The Kombai verb luwa- 'to say' has the role of generic verb of speaking which ne has in
Mandobo and, most probably, Kombai -ne has developed into a reported speech marker
from this verbal origin. The plural form -neno consists of -ne and the 2/3 PL.NF ending -no
which now only signals plurality of quoted speakers. Similarly, the medial quote-marker
-nera contains the medial verb conjunction -ra. The optional connective -0 of Mandobo
corresponds to the -e which optionally but usually precedes the quotation-markers in
Kombai.
  Having discussed the role and some formal aspects of quotation in reported speech, we
now turn to the function of direct quotation in reported thought.","[101, 102, 103, 104, 105]"

                                     INTRODU CTION    Between 1 98 2 and 1 991 I worked as a linguist o  f r the ZGK ( Mission o fthe Re of rmed
Churches) in the Upper-Digul area o fIrian Jaya with the assignment to study Wambon ,
Kombai and Korowai ,
 o
 f ur years in Kombai-speaking villages. I should thank the people living in the villages
Wanggemalo and Yaniruma o     f r their willingness to help me in learning their language. My
language teachers Geyo Weremba and Natan Renakhoremba deserve special mention. The
Rev. J.P.D. Groen o fWanggemalo shared his data on Kombai with me and also helped in
many other ways.
   This book presents some o fthe results o fthis period o fKombai language study. Chapters
2 to 5 are revised parts o fmy PhD dissertation (de Vries 1989). Chapter 6 appeared earlier in
Pinkster and Genee (1 990) . I would like to thank Pro f. Dr S .C. Dik (University o f
Amsterdam) and Dr C.L. Voorhoeve (Leiden State University), o      f r their critical comments
which led to many imp o   r vements o fthis book.
    The organisation o fthe book is as o f llows. It starts with outlines o fthe phonology and
morphology o fthe Kombai language. These outlines (Chapters 2 and 3) are data-oriented
and serve as the descriptive background o     f r the other studies which are more thematic in
nature. I have tried to place the phonological and morphological data presented in Chapters 2
and 3 in the wider context o fthe typology o fPapuan languages. Following these phonology
and morphology outlines, there are studies which concentrate on major themes o fKombai
syntax and pragmatics. Chapter 4 describes tail-head linkage and generic verb linkage
constructions ,
relational nouns in relative clauses, question-word questions and adverbial clauses. Chapter
6 describes the functions o fdirect quotation in the domains o freported speech and reported
thought. Direct quotation plays an important and interesting role in the morphosyntax o f
speech act verbs ,
presents texts.
   To give linguists o fwhatever theoretical persuasion easy access to the studies in this
book, I have not employed the o f rmal apparatus o fthe uf nctional grammar framework (Dik
1 978,1 989) which o f rms the theoretical background o f this book. S iewierska (1 991 )
provides an overview and a critical account o fthe model o f u
                                                             f nctional grammar.
   Two major assumptions o f u
                             f nctional grammar relevant to this book are the o
                                                                              f llowing.
    In the fIrst place ,
fIrst level ,
constituent parts o fthe expression, are specified. On the second level ,
which express these functional relations ,
a description o fa language system should be set up in such a way that it provides contact­
points o f r a wider theory o flanguage use and a wider theory o flanguage typology.                                             vii
viii   The distinction betwee n functional and cate gorial notions is e sse ntial within the functional
grammar frame work. Cate gorial notions like ' noun phrase ' spe cify intrinsic prope rtie s of
constitue nts, while functional not ions like 'subje ct', 'patie nt', 'topic ' specify the re lations of
constitue nts to the constructions and conte xts in which the y occur. The notions 'term ' ,
'pre dication' and ' pre dicate ' be long to the ce ntral functional notions within functional
grammar and also play a role in this book. Dik (1 989: 46) clarifie s the se distinctions as
follows:
       Pre dicate s de signate propertie s or re lations, while te rms can be use d to re fer to
       e ntitie s. A s an e xample of a pre dicate we take the verb 'give ' . This pre dicate
       de signate s a three-place re lation be twee n three e ntitie s in the role s of a 'giver',
       ' some thing give n ' , and a 'rece iver', and thus is nece ssarily applie d to three terms,
       for e xample , the terms (John), (the book), and (the librarian). Whe n a predicate is
       applied to an appropriate se t of terms, the re sult is a predication. In this e xample
       the re sulting predication can be provisionally repre sente d as:
       (4)    give (John)(the book)(to the librarian)
       S uch a predication can be interpreted as de signating a se t of states of affairs...
   Both functional and cate gorial notions are see n as crucial to the de scription of language in
the functional grammar frame work but functional notions are viewed as more fundame ntal
(Dik 1989: 23).

4      The following text contains such an example:
       (1)   . . . dunoro mofena fali      me         lara       rofano-n-a                   luwano:

             ""Gu mena ge nane-neno!""
              you this IMP.eat.imp-QUOTE
              ... they brought that food and put it down and said: ""You must eat this! ""
       I n (1) the independent form rofanona is followed by luwano. Both verbs have the same subject. Thus ( 1 )
       constitutes a counter-example to the rule that medially used independent verbs indicate D S transitions. A
       possible explanation is that examples like (1) are only apparent counter-examples. They could constitute
       speech errors. Evidence supporting this possibility is that we have heard speakers correct themselves in
       similar cases: they started with a medial independent verb followed by a verb with the same subject, then
       replaced the medial independent form by a dependent form. This happens when a speaker first wants to
       conclude his sentence, therefore choosing an independent form and then decides to add information.
5      The notions of conceptual distance and closeness are used here as defined by Haiman (1983: 783):
             First, two concepts are conceptually close to the extent that they share semantic properties
              (e.g., two verbs are closer if they share a common tense, mood, subject, object, or topic);
              second, two concepts are close to the extent that one is thought to affect the other (e.g. the
             conceptual closeness between a verb and its object varies with the transitivity of the verb);
             finally, two concepts are close to the extent that they are perceived as inseparable (e.g., there
              is a closer conceptual link between a possessor and an inalienably possessed object than
             between a possessor and an alienably possessed object).
20(67)     Wei-mo          kha-n-o.

         They went fast.
In (66) furuma specifies the manner of the 'listening' and in (67) weimo the manner of the
' going'.
   The most important source of such manner verbs is derivation from adjectives with -ma
(section 3. 1 .2.1 ). The stem-only form of the resultant adjective-based -ma verb is then used
as a manner verb.
   When two events occupy the same time span (simultaneity), this also constitutes a form of
conceptual closeness and therefore we find the stem-only form also in simultaneity-contexts:(68)     Ya umo        khano.
         they talk.SS go.3PL.NF
         While talking, they were going.
    Dependently linked clauses should be distinguished from serial root constructions (Bruce
1 986) in which two or more verb roots are juxtaposed to form one complex predicate which
is the head of one clause. This serialisation of verb roots is a productive morpho-syntactic
process in Kombai as in many other Papuan languages (Foley 1 986). The examples (69)­
(70) show serial root constructions and dependently linked clauses:

         concrete surface come.SS put. l SG.NF
         Having cut it, I took it upwards and then put it down on the concrete floor.
In (69) we see the clause u-ra 'hit.SS-and' dependently linked by the relator -ra ' and' to the
next clause. The same verb u- 'to hit, to kill' occurs in a serial root construction in the
complex predicate u-ruma-de 'I cut' in (69). In (70) we have the verb fali- ' to carry' as head
of a dependent clause linked by the interclausal relator -ra to the next clause whereas the same
root is part of the serial root construction fali-mimaye-fo in (69).
    As (69)-(70) show, serial root constructions are especially frequent with verbs of motion
and direction (e.g. marumefora in (70». The close conceptual association between the verb
denoting the motion and the one denoting the direction is formally expressed in the cohesion
of roots in the serial root construction.
                                                                                             21
3.1.3.2.2 DEPENDENT VERB FORMS WITH CLITICAL RELATORS
    There are two relator clitics which cliticise to the dependent verb: -ra and -fo. -ra is the
most frequent and the most general in meaning; it expresses coordination and at the same
time conceptual distance with respect to the following verb; thus the formation stem+ -ra
(conceptually non-close) contrasts with stem (conceptually close). The forms with -ra cannot
be used to express simultaneity, the stem-only forms may express simultaneity. -ra forms are
never used for manner modifying verbs. -ra forms are appropriate, for example, when the
flrst event starts before the next event (i.e. the two consecutive verbs do not express events
which occupy the same time-span). For example:(71)     Ya    umo-ra       khano.
         they speak.SS-and go.3PL.NF
         They spoke and went away.
In (71) the speaking starts before the going; the speaking may or may not have continued
during the going. When a speaker wants to express the idea of sequence in the sense that the
flrst event started before the second and was completed before the second, then the temporal
clitic -fo is used, for example, in (69) we flnd -fo on falimimayefo 'go out'. Since -ra does
not express a speciflc temporal relation but is a general coordinator implying conceptual non­
closeness, -ra may co-occur with -fo 'sequence'. In (72) we flnd both -ra and -fo on the
dependent verb mimafora:
(72)     . . . mima-fo-ra        ge    bumo      khukhu
               go.out.SS-SEQ-and again return.SS go.in.SS
        gwari ii-de.

3.8.2 RELATORS WITHIN NOUN AND ADJECTIVE PHRASES
3.8.2. 1 THE MODIFIER-HEAD CONNECTIVE -0
    Within noun-headed phrases the connective -0 links modifiers to the head noun. -0
cliticises to the modifIers it connects to the head noun.
   The positional distribution of -0 is determined by the relator constraint (Dik 1 983), which
states that the preferred position of a relator is in between its relata. In accordance with this
constraint, -0 never occurs with postnominal modifiers and only with prenominal modifIers.
Consider:
                                                                                               47
(209)      Kho mene rubu-khe.
           man this    bad-ADJ
           This man is bad.
(2 1 0)    Mena-n-o         kho rubu-khe.
           this-TR-CONN man bad-ADJ
           This man is bad.
(2 1 1 )   *Kho mena-n-o     rubu-khe
           man  this-TR-CONN bad-ADJ
In (2 1 0) we see -0 connecting the prenominal demonstrative to its head; in (209) the
demonstrative occurs postnominally and -0 is absent; in (2 1 1 ) -0 does not occur in between
its relata, kho and mena, and accordingly (2 1 1 ) is unacceptable.
    The modifier-head connective -0 connects all sorts of modifiers to the noun in noun­
headed phrases, irrespective of their categorial status. In (2 1 2) we see -0 linking the
attributive noun e(l) 'bird' to its head lu 'voice ' :
(2 1 2)    el-o lu
           bird-CONN voice
           the voice of the bird
-0 is sensitive to V -harmony (see section 2.3):(2 1 3)    khof-a        kha
           man-CONN skin
           the skin of a man
Adjectives and numerals occur postnominally, except for the 'ordinalia' -use of numerals with
the days of the week :
(2 1 4)    raga-n-e      rei
           fIrst-TR-CONN day
           Monday
In (2 1 4) -e (harmonised) links the prenominal numeral modifIer to the head noun.
   In (2 1 5) we have -0 with a different type of prenominal modifIer, the prenominal double­
headed RC:
(2 1 5)    Yare    gam0 khereja bogi-n-o                   rumu. . .
           old.man join.SS work     DUR.do.3SG. NF-TR-CONN person
           The old man, who is joining the work, . . .
    Yare 'old man' is the semantic-pragmatic head of the RC and rum u the grammatical head.
These double-headed prenominal RCs are the usual form of RC in Kombai. The same set of
nouns which occurs as the grammatical head in question-word phrases occurs in RC
constructions referring to persons, with a generalised meaning of 'person ' , viz. the set ( 1 85)
of section 3.6. Gamo khereja bogi is the RC, linked by -0 to rumu (there is a transitional
nasal in between -0 and the last word of the RC, see section 2.3).
  The connective -0 not only links modifiers to the heads within noun phrases but also
complements to the head within adjectival phrases:
48
(2 1 6)   Nu kha-n-o              bu-khe.
          I    go.INF. NF-TR-CONN unwilling-ADJ
          I do not want to go.
In (2 1 6) the adjectival phrase khano bukhe functions as the predicate. The adjective bukhe is
the head of this adjectival phrase. This adjective means 'unwilling' when used with infinitival
complements; in other contexts bukhe means 'tired '.
(2 1 7)   Kho mene bukhe.
          man  this tired.ADJ
          This man is tired.
The complement in (2 1 6) consists of the non-future infinitive of kha- 'to go' . We have found
constructions like (2 1 6) with adjectival predicates taking nominal infinitives only with two
adjectives, bukhe and bidoge. The latter adjective only means 'unwilling' :
(2 1 8)   Khe rakhuma-n-o          bidoge.
          he buy.NF.INF-TR-CONN unwilling
          He does not want to buy.
In both (2 1 6) and (2 1 8 ) -0 links a prenominal constituent to the head of the phrase.","[56, 57, 58]"

3.8.2.2.2 INCLUSIVE DISmNCTION
   Non-exhaustive inclusive disjunction is expressed by khale 'and/or' and by -0 'and/or':
(224)    La    khumo ba-kha-ro                  kho khumo
         woman die. S S DUR-go.3SG.NF-SUB/thing man die. S S

         DUR-go.3SG .NF-SUB/thing child young or  woman young
         khale kho muno khale khumo-ra makho Romalii
         or    man young or   die.SS-and there Romalii
         biirii khane-neno.
         place go.3PL.NF-QUOTE.PL
         About the dying of a man or a woman, a young child or a young woman or a young
         man, they said that they go to the place of Romalti after they have died.
Disjunctions with khale are open-ended (non-exhaustive). In (225), an example taken from
the same text as (224), we see the modifier-head connective -0 linking the members of the
disj unction to khale:
(225)    . . . khogade         lan-a      khale khof-o   khale khumo-ra
               in.former.times woman-CONN or    man-CONN or    die.SS -and
         luwano. . .
         say. 3PL.NF
         .. .in former times, when a woman or a man died, they said . . .
I n (225) - 0 (harmonised to -a after lan-) links lan- 'woman ' and khof- 'man ' to the relator
khale. In section 3 . 8.2. 1 we have analysed the connective clitic -0 as a modifier-head
connective. If the connective in (225) has this modifier-head linking function, then khale
must be head and lan- and khof- attributive noun modifiers. If khale is a head, it must be a
noun and not a relator.
   To understand khale, it is necessary to take into account the role of relational nouns and
verbs in Awyu-family languages. In these languages we find extensive use of members of
lexical ' content' categories (nouns and verbs) as relators, expressing a wide range of
semantic and pragmatic functions. (See Chapter 5 for the relational use of nouns and verbs.)
    To distinguish between relationally-used nouns or verbs and relators, the following
criteria may be used (cf. Chapter 5):
(226)    a.   loss of specific lexical content and development of generalised grammatical
              meanings;
         b . loss of the head of NP function for nouns and head of predicate function for
             verbs;
         c . form-changes (shortening, cliticisation).

    As for khale, our data about khale are rather limited but tentatively we might apply (226) to
    khale as follows. The noun khale possibly means 'kind, sort' and like the Indonesian noun
    maeam 'kind, sort' , in combination with another noun it may mean ' like, as, resembling ' :
    (227)     Indonesian:              Orang itu semaeam anak keeil.
              person that like           child little
              That person is like a little child.","[59, 60]"

6.5 SUMMARY
   Direct quotation plays a role in the following domains.
   The second arguments of speech act verbs are expressed by direct quotation clauses (e.g.
(360)-(365» . In a few cases, these arguments are expressed by co-subordination (cf. (402),
(404» but in those cases the verbs of speaking have causative meanings.
   Reported speech and reported thought are handled similarly in Kombai: direct quotation is
used in both domains.
   When intentional thoughts are reported, a crucial factor is whether intender and intended
are the same or not. When they differ, direct quotation is used obligatorily (cf. (375)-(376» .
When they are the same, the situation is more complicated. With first person intenders,
quotation is not used (see (377)-(378» except for constructions with motion-verbs (see
(379». For second/third person intenders, quotation is obligatory with positive intention but
optional with negative intention.
   In the domain of non-intentional thought, direct quotation is used in narrative discourse to
portray mental processes of participants (e.g. (393».
   The syntactic relation between direct quotation and quotation-margin shows considerable
independence for the quotation-clause. The non-embeddedness of the direct quotation may be
one of the reasons why direct quotation is such a preferred strategy in Kombai, In a rigid
verb-final language, the direct quotation strategy makes it possible for complex material to be
expressed after the verb, or rather independent of the position of the verb, since the complex
constituent is not in construction with the verb.
104    Another reason for the importance of direct quotation in Kombai may be the tendency in
Papuan languages to make explicit the sub-acts of actions. When the speech-element in
events is described separately by a verb of speaking, this implies in Kombai the use of direct
quotation. From the Kombai point of view, mental processes also have a speech-component
('inner speech ) and this extends the range of constructions in which direct quotation is used.
              '
   Since the use of quotative forms in intentional constructions is very widespread in Papuan
languages, it could well be that the Kombai tendency to express reported speech and reported
thought very similarly is a manifestation of a general Papuan typological characteristic.

7.1 INTRODUCTION
    The fIrst text illustrates the influence of Indonesian on Kombai as spoken by people who
were exposed to the national language (7.2). The second text is a song which is sung at the
closing ceremony of the sacred part of the sago grub feast; this feast is the most important
ritual of the Kombai (Venema 1 990). The bere song is basically a magic formula to ensure
the continuity of the sago production (7.3). Bere is the name of the closing ceremony. The
third and fourth texts (7.4 and 7.S) are daily life narratives. The fIfth text is an exposition of
the traditional Kombai beliefs about the afterlife.","[113, 114, 115]"
"In (302) Mana is the frame for the following sentential paragraph: it is a frame expressed by
the tail-head linkage construction. The assertions of (302), that the headman's wife became
unconscious and spread her arms and legs, may be understood in the framework of Ilfana 'he
hit (her) ' . This is the forward looking aspect of framing. At the same time, the frame Ilfana
links the events of (302) to the preceding series of events, told in (30 1 ). This is the backward
looking aspect of framing. The discourse unit (299)-(302) is organised around the time-line,
as a list of events. The frames in (299)-(302) relate the narrative sentences to this overall set­
up.
    The role o f tail-head linkage in processing information manifests itself also in (299)­
(302). For example after the frame Ilfana in (302) there is a pause separating it from the
following medial chain starting with khumora. There is a slowed down pronunciation of the
frame-clause, with a rise on the last syllable of Mana. And this intonation contrasts with the
falling intonation on ufa in (30 1 ) .
   This intonational pattern characteristic o f tail-head linkage may also be heard i n Irianese
Indonesian tail-head linkage:
(303)     Kemarin guru       pukuI saya.
          yesterday teacher hit     me
          Yesterday the teacher hit me.
(304)     PukUl .... baru saya Iari.
          hit       and I      ran
          He hit me and I ran away.
Finally, (299)-(302) also demonstrate the role of tail-head linkage in carrying switch­
reference over sentence-boundaries.
   In (300) the 'headman's wife' is introduced into the discourse. In (30 1 ) this topic is re­
established by the topic marker mene (see section 3.8.3.2.2). In (302) this 'headman's wife'
topical span continues, together with the 'headman' topical span, started in (299). In (302)
both topics are only identified by verb morphology (switch-reference, agreements). This type
of weak identification by verb morphology is in many Papuan languages a preferred
identification strategy. Although these languages have sets of personal pronouns, these are
hardly used to maintain topicality.
   Now in (302) this preferred identification strategy can be continued over sentence­
boundaries because of tail-head linkage: the last verb of (30 1 ), ufa, is an independent verb
form, not expressing switch-reference. B ut the recapitulated form Mana in (302) is a DS
                                                                                          73
fonn, indicating that the next clause khumora ' she became unconscious' has a different
subject than iifana. Since in (302) there are only two topical participants activated, the
addressee easily identifies the 'headman's wife' as the one who became unconscious.","[82, 83]"
"    When a lexical item develops a secondary use as a relational lexical item, in this secondary
use there will be semantic changes which may be called grammaticalisation of meaning: in
this development there is a loss of lexical specificity, and the relationally used lexical item
acquires generalised grammatical meanings. The category of relationally used lexical items is
a transitional category, a bridge between the two basic categories of lexical items and
functors.

          my-father man make.3SG.NF-TR-CONN person
          My Father who created man ...
In (35 1 ) rumu is used as a lexical item, a kinship noun. The meaning of rumu as a kinship
tenn has been described in de Vries (1987). Rumu 'son', khuri 'daughter' and miyo 'child'
fonn a set of nouns used by ego for relatives of the flrst descending generation. Miyo is the
sex-neutral reciprocal term to the Omaha-type parental set of are 'father', yeni 'mother' ,
momo 'mother's brother' (MB, MBS) and mora 'father's sister'. The primary referent of
miyo i s ego's child; generationally, miyo is extended to include the children of ego's
(classiflcatory) siblings and afflnally to those persons whom ego's spouse calls miyo. Miyo
may be replaced by rumu 'son' for a male child and khuri 'daughter' for a female child (see
de Vries 1 987: 1 1 0).
   In (352) and (353) rumu is used outside the kinship context, as a classiflcatory HN in a
question-word (352) and in an RC (353). This use of rumu as relational noun has been
described in section 5.2.
   The flrst use of rumu as kinship term, represents the use of rumu as lexical predicate,
with a speciflc content; the second use of rumu as relational HN is specified by an
expression-rule of HN-insertion which plays a role in the expression of RC, question-words
and adverbial clauses. R umu as relational noun belongs to set (354) of relational nouns:
88(354)     rumu              son
          kburi             daughter
          miyo              child
          mogo              (young) man
          nariya            man
          nariyamogo        man
The set (354) is used in question-words and RC as HN. All these nouns mean 'person '
when used relationally. Only the opposition between male persons (rumu) and female
persons (kburi) has been retained; the other semantic differences between the lexical items of
(354) have been neutralised in the generalised grammatical meaning 'human entity' in
opposition to ro 'non-human entity' (see section 5.2). Notice that in (353) the specific
kinship meaning of ' son' would be contradictory to the meaning of the topical antecedent are
'father' : rumu and are are co-referential in (353). This shows that in the relational use of
rumu there is a grammaticalised meaning which I have glossed 'person' .","[96, 97, 98]"

3.8.3. 1 RELATORS EXPRESSING SEMANTIC FUNCTIONS3.8.3 . 1 . 1 Ri
   Ri is a noun meaning 'cause, reason' . Generally used as a relational noun, it expresses
several semantic functions.

          Why are you (PL) coming?
In (232) Ii is used as a noun meaning 'reason' . In the following examples Ii is used as a
relational noun expressing purpose, addressee, destination and recipient. These examples
demonstrate the loss of lexical specificity and the development of a generalised gramm atical
meaning of ' goal ' of the action. On the other hand, the modifier-head connective -0 is
obligatorily present and this indicates that Ii syntactically functions as a noun:

3.1.3.3.5.1 HABITUAL-ITERATIVE
   When an action is intrinsically repetitive or when a plural subject implies repetition of the
action or when a habit implies repetition, in all these cases habitual-iterative verbs may be
used. The derivation of these verbs has been discussed in section 3.1.2.4. Sentence (100) is
an example of an habitual-iterative verb:
( 100)   . . yademo-ra
         .                        khuro      iigino-n-o

         They said: ""Let us have a meeting and then discuss this quarrel that they want to hit
         each other and then make peace""
28In ( 1 00) the habitual-iterative verb gegemo- is used because a public discussion (verbal
inspection) of a village-fight involves many participants (the adult males) who are
'inspecting' the case.
   In ( 1 0 1 ) the habit element determines the use of the habitual-iterative verb
khakhekhakhema- 'to be obedient ' :
(101)     Ya furn-mo             khakhe-khakhe-ma-n-o.

"
5.4 SUMMARY
   Ro 'thing' and rumu 'person' are relational nouns functioning as classifying head nouns
in question-words, Res and adverbial clauses. Rumu also functions as a lexical predicate, as
kinship term meaning ' son'.
   Question-words, Res and adverbial clauses are expressed as modifiers of relational HNs.
Ro and rumu are the most important of these HNs. This way of expressing these
constructions follows from the preferred expression for terms in Kombai, which is predicted
by the PEM for terms (see section 5 . 1 ). In subordinate clauses, the verb is not the target for
formal adjustment to the PEM for terms. Instead, HN-insertion takes place, giving the
90embedded predication, which functions as a referring expression, as term, a nominal head, at
the same preserving the verbal expression of the embedded predication.
   As in many other Papuan languages, RCs and adverbial clauses are formally very similar
in Kombai. This follows from their common functionality as terms.
    RCs, adverbial clauses and question-words are terms; now when these terms have TO as
their HN they are used to refer to non-human entities and when they have rumu as their HN,
         ,they are used to refer to human entities. Adverbial clauses with TO as their HN (the majority
of Kombai adverbial clauses has TO as their HN) are used to refer to states of affairs (events);
thus states of affairs, in specific conditions like topicality, are classified as non-human
entities. This use of TO in adverbial clauses confirms the insight of Lakoff and Johnson
( 1980) that the ontological metaphor ""Events are Things"" is operative in language. The
primary theory conceptualisation (in the sense of Horton 1982) of entities versus processes is
reflected in language by the distinction terms versus predications but languages are free, for
pragmatic purposes, to re-classify events as things in certain contexts. Ro 'thing' is the
central expressive device for this pragmatic re-classification of events as things in Kombai.
   Ro and rumu are relational nouns. This means that they belong to a transitional category
which stands in between the category of purely grammatical elements and the category of
purely lexical elements. Rumu functions both as a lexical predicate and as a relational noun;
TO functions only as a relational noun but there are signs that TO is becoming a functor in
subordinate clauses.
                                         CHAPTER 6                   DIRECf QUOTATIONS AND KOMBAI GRAMMAR6. 1 !N1RODUCTION
   The topic of this chapter is the role which direct quotation-fonns play in Kombai
grammar.
   The ftrst part of this chapter is descriptive (section 1 and 2), sketching the functions of
direct quotation in the domains of reported speech and reported thought. Direct quotation
plays an important and interesting role in the morphosyntax of speech act verbs, of
intentional constructions and of emotion/thought expressions. The function of direct
quotation in narrative discourse is to portray mental processes of participants as they react to
the events narrated in the story. Reported speech and reported thought are expressed very
similarly; they are fonnally non-distinct in some contexts. Thought is 'inner speech ' from the
Kombai point of view.
  Direct speech is so strongly preferred that we are forced to consider the possibility that
Kombai does not distinguish between direct and indirect modes of reporting speech.
   The second part of the chapter (section 3) is concerned with two factors which may have
favoured the use of direct quotation-fonns in a wide range of contexts and construction
types.
   The ftrst factor has to do with the tendency in the verbal semantics of Papuan languages to
break down an action into its component acts and express each one of these acts by a separate
verb (Foley 1 986: 1 1 3). When an event has an implicit sub-act of speaking, Papuan
languages tend to make this speech element explicit and this triggers the use of direct
quotations in Kombai.
   The second factor favouring the use of direct quotations has to do with the notion of
prefteld complexity (Dik 1989:350). I suggest that the use of direct quotations is one of a
number of strategies in Kombai to reduce syntactic complexity in the pre-verbal area of the
rigidly verb-final clause.","[99, 100, 101]"
"
4.3. 1 . 1 THE ORGANISING CENlRE OF KOMBAI NARRATIVES
   As far as the organising centre of Kombai narratives goes, the chronological succession
of events is the u sual way to set up narratives. Events which happened first, should be told
66
ftrst. Basically, Kombai narratives are lists, lists of events; these lists are ordered according
to the chronology of the events. Healey ( 1 965a: 22) describes a similar chronological
constraint in Telefol clause chains: ""Sequential clauses occur in the chronological order of the
events they describe . . . "". For Haiman ( 1 980:39 1 ) who describes how chronology conditions
the way medial clauses are conjoined to form Hua narratives, the chronological organisation
of the narrative is iconically motivated: ""just as the ftrst sentence precedes the second, so too
does the event to which it makes reference precede the event described in the second
sentence"".
   The dependent verb clitic -fa (see section 3. 1 .3.2.2) expresses the temporal relation of
sequence. There are also other means to express interclausal temporal relations (for example
with the relational verb leina, see section 3.8.5). Often, however, we do not ftnd explicit
markings of temporal relations since the general rule is that if verb A occurs before verb B ,
event A started before event B started. Within this general chronological set-up Kombai
seems to be as much interested in the conceptual closeness/distance relations of events as in
the various temporal relations which may hold between the events in discourse. For example,
there is no explicit marking of simultaneity; simultaneity is treated as a case of conceptual
closeness in Kombai (two events are conceptually close, inter alia, when they occupy the
same time-span).
   The metaphor of 'chaining' and 'chain' is often used in Papuan linguistics to clarify
interclausal relations (see Longacre 1 972 for a general treatment of clause chaining in New
Guinea languages). Following Healey (1 966) I apply the notion of 'chaining' also to levels
higher than the clause, namely to relations between sentential paragraphs within Kombai
narratives. Just as single verb clauses within the sentence are 'chained' into the medial chain
(see below), the narrative sentences in their turn are 'chained' into the discourse, that is there
is not much embedding of discourse units in other units; there is a very ' flat' hierarchical
structure in most of the Kombai narratives.","[75, 76]"

5.2.3 ADVERBIAL CLAUSES
5.2.3. 1 INTRODUCTION
   Adverbial clause is the label I shall use for embedded predications which function as
satellite-tenns in a higher predication, with peripheral semantic functions such as time,
condition, purpose, cause and reason.
   In adverbial clauses ro has the same two functions as in question-words and RCs. First a
syntactic function of providing the adverbial clause with a HN. Secondly, ro has a
classificatory function : it classifies the intended referent of the adverbial clause as a non­
human entity.
                                                                                                   i                                                                                                   I
                                                                                                  -l
                                                                                               815.2.3.2 STATES OF AFFAIRS AS NON-HUMAN ENTITIES
     In the context of an anthropological discussion about the (dis-)continuity of thought­
pattern between (African) ' traditional' cultures and (Western) 'modern ' cultures, Horton
( 1 982) proposes that in all cultures there are two distinct but complementary levels of thought
and discourse, which he calls 'primary theory' and 'secondary theory ' (Horton 1 982:228).
   Primary theory does not very much differ from culture to culture. Primary theory gives
the world a foreground of time-stable, solid objects which are interrelated in a 'push-pull'
conception of causality, in which temporal and spatial contiguity are viewed as essential to
the transmission of change. In the time dimension, there is a trichotomy of 'before/at the
same time/after' . The objects are subdivided into human objects or entities and non-human
entities. In this way Horton sums up a number of distinctions belonging to the primary
theory.
   Secondary theory differs very much from culture to culture, contrasting in this respect
with primary theory which varies within very narrow limits. Whereas in the foreground
world of primary theory the entities (objects) and processes are thought of as directly given
to the observer, in secondary theory the entities and processes are somehow 'hidden ' .
African spirits share this element of hiddenness with Western particles, currents and waves.
   Although the whole of Horton's lucid and interesting article is of relevance to linguistics
and translation theory, here we shall restrict ourselves to two points which are of immediate
importance to our understanding of the role of ro and rum u in Kombai grammar. The first is
the primary theory distinction between objects (entities) and processes (states of affairs in the
terms of Dik ( 1978). The second is the primary theory distinction between human and non­
human (other) entities.
   The opposition between human and non-human entities is reflected by the opposition of
ro 'thing' and rumu 'person ' in Kombai. Above we have seen how in relative clauses there is
a fundamental distinction between relative terms referring to human beings (rumu as HN)
and relative terms referring to non-human entities (ro as HN). We have found the same
contrast in question-word questions (see section 5.2.2). In this section we shall see how TO
in adverbial clauses classifies states of affairs as 'non-human entities' .
   The primary theory distinction of entities versus states o f affairs (things versus events) i s
reflected i n human language i n the distinction between two types o f linguistic expression,
those expression used to refer to entities (Dik ( 1 978) calls them ' terms' ) and those that
denote states of affairs (predications in Dik's terminology). Term and predication are
functional and not categorial notions like clause and noun phrase; this distinction between
functional and categorial notions is essential since terms for example need not always be
noun-headed constituents. Nevertheless, there is a language-independent prototypical
expression model for terms (PEM, see section 5. 1 for the definition).
   Terms not only have a prototypical or primary expression (PEM) but also a primary
function: they are used by the speaker to refer to entities.
   However, in certain conditions speakers do not use terms for reference to entities, the
primary use, but for reference to states of affairs. Consider (335):
82
(335)    Uni berino-n-o              ro,   na-biiwogo gamo
         Uni DUR.make.3PL.NF-TR-CONN thing my-parent join. S S         rino.
         make.3PL.NF
         When they built Uni, my parents also joined the work.
The adverbial ro-term is used to refer to an event in the past (the building of Uni) about
which event the speaker wants to say something.","[90, 91, 92]"
"   The secondary use of terms to refer to states of affairs, is captured by the functional
grammar formalism (336):
(336)    ( Xi : [pREDICATION] (Xi ) )
Dik ( 1985a:83) describes (336) as a ""term which refers to an entity of the type ' state of
affairs""'. Example (336) is not in contradiction with the basic opposition between terms and
predications; above we have stated that the term versus predication distinction is the linguistic
reflection of the corresponding ontological distinction of 'primary theory' . Rather, (336)
adequately reflects that, in certain discourse conditions such as topicality, ""Events and
actions are conceptualized metaphorically as objects."" (Lakoff and Johnson 1 980:30).
   I view this metaphorical conceptualisation of events as things as a pragmatic and not as a
logical or semantic process. Kombai adverbial clauses with ro reflect this pragmatic metaphor
'States of affairs are entities' in a transparent way. We have seen in sections 5.2. 1 and 5 .2.2
that ro/rumu function in RC and question-word questions as a type of classifiers, classifying
entities as human (rumu) or non-human entities (ro) and thus helping the addressee in the
identification of the intended referents. Ro in adverbial clauses has this same classificatory
function: it classifies states of affairs as ro, as non-human entities, thereby reflecting the
'ontological metaphor'. Since states of affairs are the only type of entities adverbial clauses
refer to (they never refer to human entities), it follows that rumu never occurs as an HN with
adverbial clauses.
   In Papuan languages, the most common condition in which reference to states of affairs
takes place, is when speakers want to predicate something about a state of affairs. In such
cases the state of affairs is treated as the speaker's topical entity. Example (335) is an
example of such a topical state of affairs.
   But this topical condition is not the only pragmatic condition in which we find reference to
states of affairs. Sometimes, focus is involved. Below (example (343)) an adverbial purpose
clause with focus function will be discussed. Adverbial clauses with ro have two
characteristics: they are generally topical and they may have several semantic interpretations,
depending on the context. The following examples illustrate these features:
(337)    Mii bokhe-re                  nu fe-ani-madii.
         rain D UR.be.3SG.NF-thing/SUB I NEG-go.F-NEG
         If it rains, I shall not go.
Literally (337) says ' (about) the thing that it rains, I shall not go' . Ro in (337) has cliticised
and harmonised to reo In (337) the speaker refers to a raining event and then uses this raining
event as the setting or background for the following predication. The adverbial clause with ro
has a conditional semantic interpretation in (337).
                                                                                           83(338)     Nu yabomade ro                 feanimadii
          I  ill. 1 SG.NF thing/SUB I . shall.not.go
          Because I am ill, I shall not go.
(339)     Nu weimo        femunudo-n-o        ro       khunu lede.
          I  be.quick.SS NEG.come.NF-TR-CONN thing/SUB sleep lay. 1 SG .N F
          Concerning m y being late, I slept.
Again the ro adverbial clauses in (33 8)-(339) are topical; in (338) the clause gets a reason
interpretation, in (339) a result interpretation. The topicality of such adverbial clauses is
confirmed by the fact that the demonstrative-based marker of new topics and frames mene
optionally co-occurs with ro:
(340)     Amakhalo khumolei   ro        mene, dadagu
          Amakhalo die.3SG.NF thing/SUB FRM in. the. beginning
          khe bokhugi-n-o               ro        mofene
          he DUR.be.il1 .3SG.NF-TR-CONN thing/SUB then
          kh waimigi waluwano:             ""Foro    mojamonone!"" .
          foreigners COM. say. 3PL.NF bring. S S descend.IMP.PL
          A s for the death of Amakhalo, when he was ill in the beginning, the white
          foreigners had said : ""Bring him to us!"".
Example (340) has two ro predications, the first is a predication-external frame, with mene as
the frame marker; the second a predication-internal temporal frame.
    In (34 1 ) ro is used in a title expression:
(34 1 )   rakhe emukhe-ro
          money lost-thing
          the lost money
Example (34 1 ) is the Kombai title for the story about the lost coin.
   Ro is the most frequent but not the only HN in adverbial clauses; so far we have found
two others, ri 'cause, reason ' and wamii 'middle' . Ri and wam ii are semantic subordinators
expressing the semantic functions purpose and time. Example (343) contains a ri embedded
predication, (344) a wamii embedded predication:
(342)     Gu narof-o        ri-n-a    bome?
          you what-CONN reason-TR-FOC DUR.come.2SG.NF
          Why are you coming?
(343)     Nu ai rakhuma-n-o           ri-n-a         mede.
          I   pig buy .INF.NF-TR-CONN reason- TR-FOC come. 1 SG.NF
          I come to buy the pig.
(344)     Lu   badiya-n-o                         wamii kho mofenadi luwa: ...

          When he was teaching, a man said: . . ./While he was teaching, a man said: ...
Ri 'reason ' i s used as a relational noun to express a wide range of semantic functions
(purpose, addressed, reason, recipient, destination).
   Notice that the ri and wam ii adverbial clauses also conform to the preferred noun-headed
expression of terms (ii) of section 5. 1 .
84   Wamii clauses are also topical; this topicality is only expressed by the clause-initial
position they occupy in the main predication. In (343), however, the ri embedded
predication, is not topical. In the context of (342), this embedded predication has focus
function and this is expressed by the focus marker -a (see section 3.8.3.2. 1 ) .","[92, 93, 94]"
"
3.1.2.3 NOUN-BASED DERIVED VERBS
   Although there are many noun-based -rna verbs, there is no (longer) productive
verbalisation of nouns with -rna. So far I have found only a couple of -khe derived verbs
based on nouns. Example (47a) is an example of a noun-based derived verb with -rna and
example (47b) with -khe:
(47a)       rakhe             money
            rakhu-ma-         to pay; to buy; to sell
(47b)       fina              thought, desire
            fina-ge-          to think, desire
3.1.2.4 HABITUAL-ITERATIVE VERB FORMATION WITH -rna
   From verbs, habitual-iterative verbs are productively derived by reduplicating the verb­
root and adding -rna. For example:
(48)        khakhe­                         to listen
            khakhe-khakhe-rna-              to listen habitually; to be obedient
(49)        ne­                             to eat
            ne-ne-rna-                      to eat repeatedly/usually
2      See section 2 .3 for the nasal assimilation khe> ge
                                                  -     -   .
16(50)        Ya doii ne-ne-ma-n-o.
            they sago eat-eat-SUPP-TR-3PL.NF
            They usually eat sago.ffhey are sago-eaters.
3.1.2.5 -khe AND lEMPORALS
     With certain time words, temporal verbs can be derived with -khe. For example:(51)        rei               sun; day
            rei-khe-          to become light
The verb reikhe- is always used as the centre of a temporal clause, with the meaning
'tomorrow':(52)        Be-rei-khe-n-a              nu meda.
            DUR-day-SUPP.3SG.NF-TR-CONN I come.1SG.INT
            Tomorrow I want to come.
Example (52) literally says 'it is becoming day and I come'.
     With the Indonesian words for the days of the week -khe is also frequently used:
(53)        hari Jumat               Friday (Indonesian)
            harijuma t-khe-          to be (come) Friday
Verbs like harijumatkhe- are generally used in temporal clauses, connected with the
coordinating connective -a to the rest of the sentence:
(54)        Harijumat-khe-n-a          nu yabo-ma-de.
            Friday-SUPP.3SG.NF-TR-CONN I  ill-SUPP-1SG.NF
            On Friday I fell ill.
3.1.2.6 -khe AND EXPERIENTIALS
  Experiential verbs are verbs denoting psychological or physical conditions which people
may experience, for example, to be angry, cold, hungry, sad.
   Kombai experiential verbs, like Wambon experiential verbs (see de Vries 1989:15) have
their experiencers expressed as topics3 (see Dik 1978:141) and their phenomena or
conditions, if they are overtly expressed, as subjects:
(56)        Nu rere bomari.
            I   blood DUR.go.down.3SG.NF
            I am bleeding.
In (56) the verb agrees with the phenomenon subject rere 'blood'. The topic is nu 'I'.
Example (56) says literally: 'As far as I am concerned, the blood comes down'.
     In Kombai we often find experiential predicates with -khe. For example:
3      The existence of experiencer topics with experiential verbs has been reported for many Papuan languages
       (Davies 1981; Reesink 1984). In experiential predicates there tends to be a generalised 'do', 'be', 'come'
       or 'hit/strike' verb as support-verb to create an experiential predicate.
                                                                                            17
(57)     Nagu khun ii-ge.
         we    sleep-SUPP.3SG.NF
         We are sleepy.
(58)     Ya okh-o          fina-ge.
         they water-CONN thought-SUPP.3SG.NF
         They are thirsty.
Drabbe (1955:100) has described similar phenomena in Marind labelling constructions such
as (57)-(58) 'eventive'. Drabbe (1955:86) remarks that eventive predicates often are formed
with the auxiliary (support-verb) a.
3.1.2.7 -rna AND THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE
    Immediate future verbs are productively derived by adding the support-verb -rna to future
infinitives. Future infinitives are formed (see section 3.1.3.5) by adding the future marker -i
to the future stem. Examples:
(59)     ne-            to eat (non-future stem)
         ade­           to eat (future stem)
         adeni­         future infmitive
         adenirna-      to eat in a moment (immediate future verb)
(60)     Doti ade-n-i-rna-de.
         sago eat-TR-F-SUPP-1SG.NF
         I shall eat sago in a moment.
   I have analysed the formation of immediate future verbs as a derivational process,
analogous to the formation of habitual-iterative verbs with -rna (see section 3.1.2.4). Notice
that the support-verb takes non-future endings in this immediate future formation.
   Immediate future verbs are typically used when the speaker announces what he is going to
do or say presently:
(61)     Mene umo-n-i-rna-de-ro...
         this   say-TR-F-SUPP-1SG.NF-SUB/thing
         What I am going to tell about...
Somebody may also close a conversation by using (62) just before leaving:
(62)    Nu b-a-n-i-rna-de.
        I   DUR-go-TR-F-SUPP-1SG.NF
        I am going now.
The example (62) could be rendered also as: 'I am such that I will go in the near future.'
More research is needed to establish the meaning of these forms. One of the possibilities is
that these forms express both prospective aspect and immediate future tense. Drabbe
(1955: 42) noticed a similar combination of modal, aspectual and tense meanings for what he
termed the futurum proxirnum in Marind. The Marind futurum proxirnum (immediate future)
also has meanings like 'op het punt staan te' ('to be about to do something', immediate
prospective aspect) and 'van plan zijn te' ('to plan to do something', intentional mood).
183.1.2.8 THE NEGATION -do WITH -rna
   The negation -do (see section 3.1.3.3.6) also forms input for -rna derivation. The only
form of the resultant negative verb that I encountered is the dependent same subject (SS)
form dorno (see section 3.1.3.2 for dependent SS forms). This dorno 'not do/not be' is the
stem-only form. These stem-only dependent verb forms are often used as modifiers of the
next verb (see section 3.1.3.2.1).
   The element dorno is only used as a negative in the imperative. The imperative negative
consists of domo followed by the imperative form of the verb (see section 3.1.3.3.4.1.1):
(63)    Do-mo             ade-n-i!
        NEG-SUPP.SS eat-TR-IMP
        Do not eat!","[25, 26, 27, 28]"
"
4.3.2 THE EXPRESSION OF FRAMES IN NARRATIVES
   In the functional grammar theory (Dik 1 978), informational relations between constituents
are treated in terms of pragmatic functions. Besides pragmatic functions, like topic and
focus, there are semantic functions (agent, beneficiary, etc.) and syntactic functions (subject,
object).
   A language expression is described on two levels:the levels of predication and of
expression. A predication is a non-linear representation of the expression in which for each
constituent there is a functional specification indicating which semantic, pragmatic and
syntactic functions have been assigned to these constituents. Expression-rules express these
functions in the form and order of constituents. These rules are triggered by the functional
specification in the underlying predication and form the link between the predication and its
expression.
   Of all the functions specified in the predication, only a part receives formal expression in
the morpho-syntax of clauses and sentences: there are limits to the amount of functional
information to be coded morpho-syntactically.
   The pragmatic function of frame is assigned to constituents which specify the setting or
background for the subsequent predication and which link this predication to the preceding
predication or the organising centre of the discourse-chunk. Just as the other functions,
frames are not always overtly expressed. Many languages have frame constructions, that is,
                                                                                             69
constructions which intrinsically define a certain constituent as the frame. For example, in
English, the as for construction:
(294)    As for Paris, the Eiffel tower is really spectacular.
However, in English the left-most position is often the only indication of frame-hood. For
example, in (286d) above, in 1 926 has the functional specification time frame, that is, a
constituent with the semantic function of time and the pragmatic function of frame; this
pragmatic function is only expressed by position; the semantic function is expressed by in.","[78, 79]"
"
4.3.2.2 GENERIC VERB LINKAGE
   Closely related to tail-head linkage is generic verb linkage. Both tail-head linkage and
generic verb linkage are frame-constructions, that is, expressive devices specifically
associated with the frame function. In generic verb linkage a generic verb meaning 'to do' or
'to do thus', is the recapitulatory element. By using generic verb linkage, the verbatim and
more elaborate repetition of tail-head linkage is avoided but the clausal form of the
recapitulation is retained. Tail-head linkage is by far the most frequent of the two. (305)­
(306) are examples of generic verb linkage:
(305)    Rei fenadi khe kho badu luwo adiya.
         day one     he man many word give . 3 S G . NF
         One day he addressed a large crowd.
(306)    Mo-ra       mali         bokha-n-a...
         do.S S-and descend.SS DUR.go.3SG.NF-TR-CONN (DS)
         Thus he did and he went down and .. (DS) ...
In (306) the frame is a clause consisting of the dependent verb fonn mora ' do.SS.and' ; the
[mal predicate of (305) is not repeated verbatim but the recapitulation takes the fonn of the
generic verb mora. ( 305)-(306) present an example of generic verb linkage in subject
continuity conditions. In (307)-(308) we find the DS fonn of the generic verb:
(307)    Khumolei-n-a                    ifamano.
         die.3SG.N F-TR-CONN (DS)        bury. 3PL.NF
         He died and they buried him.
(308)    Ma-n-a                     khwaimigi mene luwano: . . .
        do.3SG.NF-CONN (DS) foreigner            this   say.3PL.NF
        And then the foreigners said: ...
Notice that ifamano in (307) is a 3PL fonn; accordingly, we would expect the recapitulatory
verb of (308) to be of the same number and person, that is the 3PL.NF fonn of the generic
verb manona 'thus they did and .. (DS) ... '; instead we find the 3SG.NF fonn mana; this
fonn is always found as a linking verb in DS conditions, suggesting that mana has become a
relator, an invariable marker of the DS transition (see section 3.8.5 for relational verbs).
   Generic verbs do not repeat the infonnation of the preceding final clause; instead, they
point back to that information. In Kombai this anaphoric element is not formally expressed
but in Wambon the generic ' do' verb linking sentences has this anaphoric element fonnally
expressed: when used as linking verb, mo- 'to do' is not found but jamo- 'to do thus/that' is
found:
(309)    Kono Kikhup-ka okimalevambo.
        next Digul-in     take.a.bath . l PL.PAST
        Next we took a bath in the Digul.
74
(3 1 0)    Jamo-m beJ-o             ap   kalevambo.
           thus.do.SS-SEQ-COORD house go. 1 PL.PAST
           Having done so, we went home.
Of course, the anaphoric way to connect sentences is one found all over the world.
Anaphoric locative frames like there or temporal frames like then are often used in English to
connect sentences. The verbatim repetition of tail-head linkage, and the frequency of this
linking device, are cross-linguistically rather marked. Papuan languages appear to prefer to
repeat information rather than point back to it. Of course, they also have the options of
anaphoric frames and generic verb linkage but tail-head linkage, especially in narratives, is
the first choice.","[83, 84]"

1 .4.2 KOMBAI AS A TRANs -NEW GUINEA PHYLUM LANGUAGE
   In Ko mbai we find prenasalisatio n o f voiced sto ps, a widespread feature o f the TNGP
(McElhano n & Voorhoeve 1 970) but also o ccurring in many Austro nesian languages bo th
within and o utside New Guinea (Haiman 1 980:xxxiii).
4   The Ko mbai syl lable structure without CC cl usters reflects the usual TNGP syll able
structure (see Reesink 1 984: 1 5).
   In several TNGP languages we find restrictio ns on the co nsonants that may clo se the
syll able (see Reesink ( 1 984: 1 5); Haiman ( 1 980:xxxiv» . In Ko mbai no consonants may clo se
the syl labl e.
 The quite elabo rate morpho pho nemics of Kombai represents a general TNGP feature (see
Wurm 1 982 :77).
    Kombai has a seven vo wel system, incl uding a fro nt ro unded clo se vowel I yl and a back
spread clo se vowel Iml, and this is two more than the usual TNGP five vo wel system. The
fro nt rounded vowels are a typical additio n o f the Awyu-famil y to the five vo wel system (see
Wurm ( 1 982 : 1 39)). The back spread clo se vo wel Iml makes the Ko mbai vo wel system
nicel y symmetrical, with the fro nt o ppo sitio n I i! vs. I yl mirro red by the back o ppo sitio n Iml
vs. luI.
   Kombai emplo ys suffixes in the verb morphology (but there are aspectual prefixes), like
mo st o ther TNGP l anguages. In the no un mo rpho lo gy we meet the usual po ssessive
prefixes.
   The category co nflatio n of seco nd and third perso n in Kombai verb paradigms (bo th in
singular and pl ural) o ccurs commo nly in the TNGP, especiall y in the no n-singular (Haiman
1 980:xxxix; Wurm 1 982:83).
   The dependent verbs are ano ther typical TNGP pheno meno n that we al so find in Ko mbai
(see Wurm 1 982 : 83). Ho wever, they are no t very strongly represented in Ko mbai. In this
respect, Ko mbai fits into the general Awyu-famil y pattern. Altho ugh the temporal relatio n o f
sequence finds expressio n i n dependent verb fo rms i n Ko mbai (stem+-[o ), the o ppo sitio n
co nceptuall y clo se versus co nceptuall y no n-clo se seems to be mo re impo rtant. The
simul taneity relatio n for exampl e is subsumed in Kombai under the co nceptually clo se verb
form. Wambo n, whi ch is a mo re typical TNGP language as far as medial verbs and the
catego ries they express are co ncerned, does express the sequence-simultaneity o ppo sition in
the medial forms.
   Ko mbai suppo rt-verbs -ma and -khe reflect a general TNGP pattern (see Haiman
1 980:xl vi).
   The tense-rel ated suppletive stems of Ko mbai verbs seem to be a typical Awyu-family
feature (see Wurm (1982 : 1 39» . L eaving the verb morpho lo gy, we turn to pro no uns.
    The base co nso nants of the Ko mbai personal pro no uns of first and seco nd perso n reflect

3.8.2.2 RELATORS WITHIN COORDINATE NOUN PHRASES
3.8.2.2. 1 EXHAUSTIVE ENUMERATION WITH -khu     Exhaustive enumeration is expressed with -khu:
(2 1 9)   nu-khu gu-khu
          I-and   you-and
          you and me
(220)     Ola-khu khe-wabii             Fiabo-khu khuro-khuro unafano.
          Ola-and his-younger.brother Fiabo-and each.other    hit.3PL.NF
          Ola and his younger brother hit each other.
The relator -khu is attached to all members of the coordination, as is the normal pattern in
Awyu-family languages (de Vries 1 986). We have never found -khu coordinating more than
two noun phrases; these phrases must have the same functional specification but structurally
they may differ slightly (see for example (220» .
   -khu has a number of functions, one of which is the coordination of nouns. B asically,
-khu is an adverbial clitic (see section 3 .7) meaning 'also ' :
(22 1 )   Nani-khu        yaboma.
          my. mother-also iI1.3SG.NF
          My mother also is ill.
With numerals, -khu functions as an attributive suffix (see section 3.5.3):
(222)     kho abalo-khu
          man thumb-alsolATTR
          five men
In the attributive use with numerals, the 'also' meaning is still detectable.
                                                                                             49
   Finally, -khu sometimes functions as a predicative:
(223)    Mene umonemade-ro               mena-khu.
         this  speak.IM MF. l S G-SUB this-PRED
         What I am going to speak about, is this.","[58, 59]"
"
6.3 REPORTED THOUGHT
   Direct quotation-forms play an important role in the domain of reported thought, too.
Mental processes (intention, attitudes, emotions) are often portrayed as a form of speech,
'inner speech' a person directs to himself. Drabbe ( 1 950, 1 955,1957, 1 959) has already noted
that thought and motives are represented as quoted speech in languages of the Marind and
Awyu family. 1 6 Healey (1964:29) describes the use of quotative clauses in Telefol with ""to
say, think, see, know, feel"" and calls the use of direct speech forms for the expression of
non-verbalised thought ""direct cerebration"".
   Formally, the quotation is the same whether used in reported speech or reported thought.
The difference between the two is optionally expressed in the quotation-margin by lexical
means. It is true that the generic verb of speaking cannot be used in certain reported thought
contexts but in other reported thought contexts this verb, luwa- 'to say, speak', is obligatory
(see examples (375)-(376) below). The verbs rerama- 'to be glad' (example (386» and
kharabuma- 'to be astonished' are examples of lexical means in the quotation-margin
indicating the type of mental process in reported thought-constructions. We may distinguish
between intentional thoughts and other (non-intentional) thoughts when describing the role of
direct quotation in reported thought.",[105]
"The origin of the use of -khu with numbers lies in the Kombai counting habit: in counting up
to, say, six, all the fingers are bent one after the other and then the wrist is touched. Thus
'men the wrist also' means ' six men '.
   For the numbers 'one', 'two', 'three' and 'four' there are no attributive forms with -khu
but special unpredictable attributive forms:
( 1 80)   kho mofenadi
          man one
          one man
          kho molumo
          man two
          two men
                                                                                             41
          kho molumonefe
          man three
          three men
          kho molumo-molumo
          man four (two-two)
          four men
For attributive 'one' some speakers use the word mokhaJiyo. The special attributive forms of
( 1 80) are the only real numerals of Kombai, real in the sense of not based on body-parts.
Notice that the forms for ' two', 'three' and ' four' in ( 1 80) are all based on the word
molumo.
    The attributive form mofenadi 'one' is occasionally used to express indefmiteness:
(181)     Kho mofenadi bome.
          man  one       DUR.come.3SG.NF
          There came a man.
    Healey ( 1 965b:28) also reports the formation of attributive forms of the numerals in
Telefo!. This language belongs to the Ok family, the eastern neighbour of the Awyu family.
In Telefol the suffix -kaJ is added when the numerals are used to qualify nouns. This -kal
functions primarily as a locative relator 'at ' . From 'five' ( ' at left thumb ' ) upward to
'fourteen' ('at nose') -kaJ is added in attributive use. Like Kombai -khu the suffix -kaJ is not
used with the n umerals 'one' to 'four' but unlike Kombai Telefol does not have special
attributive forms for these. Numbers higher than 'fourteen ' ('at nose' , the turning point in
the Telefol system) do not take -kaJ in attributive use but an expression denoting 'the other
side' (comparable to Kombai imofo 'the other side').
   Thus far we have discussed cardinal numerals; we have found the n umber words used as
'ordinalia' only with the days of the week:
( 1 82)   raga-n-e      rei
          frrst-TR-CONN day
          Monday
          ragaragu-n-e   rei
          second-TR-CONN day
          Tuesday
          wororagu-n-e  rei
          third-TR-CONN day
          Wednesday
          woro-n-e       rei
          fourth-TR-CONN day
          Thursday
          abalof-e   rei
          fifth-CONN day
          Friday
          go-n-e        rei
          sixth-TR-CONN day
          Saturday
42For ' S unday' the Indonesian loan words hari Minggu 'Sunday ' or sembahyang 'worship'
are used.
   The ordinalia of ( 1 82) differ in two respects from the 'cardinalia'. First, the ordinalia do
not use the suffix -khU; second, there are no special attributive forms for 'one' , 'two ' , 'three'
and 'four'. Since we do not find the ordinalia outside the 'days of the week' context, we may
conclude that Kombai does not have regular ordinalia.","[50, 51, 52]"
"3 . 1 .3.3.3 TENSE
   The basic tense-opposition in Kombai is future versus non-future. For events occurring
after 'utterance-time' the future tense is used and for events before 'utterance-time' the non­
future is used. In the stems of the great majority of verbs this opposition is reflected: there is
a non-future stem and a future stem.
   For events occurring after 'utterance-time' the future is the unmarked choice but in certain
conditions the intentional mood or the immediate future is used. Like the iterative-habitual
aspect, the immediate future tense is a derivational and not an inflectional category (see
section 3.1.2.7)
3 . 1 .3.3.3. 1 NON-FUTURE TENSE
  The non-future tense marker is the suffix -de. However, in 2/3 SG and PL forms this
marker is absent. The non-future (NF) is formed as follows:
(73)     basic stem (non-future stem) + tense + person + number
Example (74) is the paradigm for kha- 'to go':
(74)       SG           1:          khade      I goll went
                   NON- I :         kha        you(SG)/he/she/it go(es)/went
           PL           1:          khadefo    we go/we went
                   NON- I :         khano      you(pL)/they go/went
Example (74) is the paradigm after the application of the morphophonemic rules. The
underlying form of I SG consists of the stem plus the tense marker -de plus the person
marker -f- (flrst person); the number (singular) is zero-marked. This basic form khadefis
turned into the form khade by application of final consonant deletion (see section 2.3
examples ( 17) and ( 1 8)). When the ISG non-future form is used medially and linked to the
next clause by the connective -a, the first person marker is no longer final and appears before
the connective (khadef-a 'I go/went and...').
                              ...",[32]
"
3.1.3 VERB INFLECTION
3.1.3.1 DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT VERBS
   Sentence-medial forms are one of the outstanding features of TNGP languages (Wurm
1982:83). Generally in the Awyu-family sentence-medial forms are not highly developed
(Wurm 1982:139), with the exception of Warnbon which has quite elaborate sentence-medial
forms (de Vries & de Vries-Wiersma 1992).
   Kombai is a more typical Awyu-Ianguage as far as medial forms go: although they do
occur, they are not strongly represented. Whereas in Wambon there are special medial
different subject (DS) forms, in Kombai these are absent, although the DS/SS opposition is
expressed in Kombai also.
   Dependent verbs in Kombai are verb forms which for their person-number and tense­
mood interpretation depend on the next independent verb form. Dependent verb forms only
occur medially in the sentence and always imply that the next verb has the same subject (SS
transition) as the dependent verb. Dependent verbs may indicate the temporal relationship
holding between the dependent verb and the next verb in the sentence.
   Dependent verb clauses are always coordinated to the next clause. In (64) ferara is an
example of a dependent verb form:
(64)         fera-ra    gwari b-udef-a
             see.SS-and snake DUR-hit.1SG.NF-CONN(DS)
        gwari rnene bornu.
        snake TOP resist.violently.3SG.NF
        ...I saw (the snake) and when I was hitting the snake, it resisted violently.
In (64) budefa and bornu are independent verb forms. Example (64) is part of a long chain of
dependent and independent verbs. Such narrative chaining in long sentences containing many
verbs is a common way of building sentences in TNGP languages.
   Independent verb forms express person-number and tense-mood distinctions
independently. They may occur both medially and finally in sentences. When occurring
medially, independent verb forms normally are followed by verbs with a different subject.
We have found, however, some examples of medially occuring independent verbs in SS
                                                                                                              19
transitions.4 Nevertheless the conclusion seems safe that the medial occurrence of
independent verbs indicates a DS transition whereas dependent verbs signal SS transitions.
Thus the finite versus non-finite distinction has been grammaticalised into the SSIDS
opposition.
   The medial use of budefa indicates the change of subject between the first person singular
subject of budefa and the gwari subject of bomu.","[28, 29]"

3.8. 3. 1 .3 DIMENSIONAL RELATIONAL NOUNS
   The dimensional nouns of (244) play an important role in the expression of locative
semantic relations:8    Kwai or khwai (sometimes khwaYI) primarily means 'spiri t (of a dead person)'; secondari ly it is widely
     used to refer to (white) foreigners and this reflects the way the Kombai people view(ed) white foreigners
     in the initial stage of the contact: as sp irits. In compound nouns khwayi is used for objects introduced
     by or associated wi th foreigners; there are very many of these compounds. For example , khaJo means
     'grass' but khwayi-khaJo 'foreigners grass' refers to the lawn commonly found around houses of
     foreigners. Kunci is an Indonesian loan meaning 'key '; khwayi-kunci means 'key of the foreigners'.
                                                                                                   53
(244)     khaJu           inside
          da              topside, surface
          burna           backside
          ragu            frontside
          fura            bottomside
          Fe              side
These nouns are used relationally to express locative relations; optionally, the modifier-head
connective -0 links the modifying noun to the dimensional noun which is the syntactic head
of the phrase:
(245)      Guru      a      khaJu ba-khe?
           teacher house inside stay.3SG.NF-Q
           Is the teacher in the house?
(246)      EdoF-o          da        ba.
           tree-CONN topside stay .3SG.NF
           It sat in the top of a tree.
Burna 'backside' and ragu 'frontside' have as primary meaning body parts, burna 'back' and
ragu ' nose ' .
    Similar use o f sets o f locative dimensional nouns has been reported for Marind (Drabbe
1 955) and for Telefol (Healey 1965 : 1 2). Drabbe ( 1 955) describes such nouns as locative
postpositions. Interestingly, in Marind there are two sets of locative relational nouns, one
animate and one inanimate, for example, to express the locative relation 'in front of' with
humans and animals (animate referents), the relational noun onah is used and with inanimate
referents the noun rnahai is used. The set for animate referents is based on nouns denoting
body parts such as the back (Drabbe 1955: 1 34).","[62, 63]"
"The story from which the sentential paragraphs (292)-(293) are a part, has the overall set-up
of presenting a chronological list of events. The frame of (293) is urumadefo leina ' having
cut it'. This frame has been expressed by a tail-head linkage construction (see section
4.3.2. 1 ), which recapitulates the independent verb urumade ' I cut it' of the final clause of
(292). The new information to be asserted in (293) should be understood as the insert for the
frame 'having cut it'; at the same time this frame links the list of events of (293) to the list of
(292).
  The medial chain in (293) consists of seven coordinate-dependent clauses, from fora to
khalu; these single verb clauses do not contain any nominal material. The topics ' I ' and ' the
snake ' are maintained by verbal means (switch-reference, subject person-number
agreements) and not by (pro)nominal means. On the other hand, events are spelled out in
detail. For example in (293) a dependent verb form specifying the direction of a motion
occurs twice.
   The final clause in (293) has rofadefe ' I put it' as its centre, expressing the main assertion
of this sentence; the preceding dependent verbs depend on the independent verb form of the
final clause for their subject person-number and tense-mood interpretation.",[78]
"
4.2 THE DISCOURSE DIMENSION OF FRAMING
    Clark and Clark ( 1 977:245) define the term 'frame ' as follows: "" ... the frame of a sentence
is its first main phrase. In During the summer, Alison lives in Scotland, the phrase during the
summer is the frame, the setting within which one can understand the information that Alison
lives in Scotland"". This definition comes close to the definition of Halliday ( 1 970 : 1 6 1 ) of
theme as ""the peg on which the message is hung . . . which, in English, is put in first
position"".
    To clarify their notion of frame and its role in discourse, Clark and Clark ( 1 977) point to a
study by Linde and Labov ( 1 975) on the description of apartments. Linde and Labov tape­
recorded about 100 New Yorkers as they answered the question, ""Could you tell us the lay­
out of your apartment?"". Interestingly, most respondents (over 97 per cent) solved the
problem of how to explain the layout of their apartment by describing a tour of the apartment,
like this:
(285)     You walked in the front door. There was a narrow hallway. To the left, the first
          door you came to was a tiny bedroom. Then there was a kitchen, and then
          bathroom, and then the main room was in the back, living room, I guess.
   In the following comment by Clark and Clark ( 1 977:245) the functionality of frames in
discourse is clearly stated : ""In the apartment descriptions, people selected frames with great
consistency. Some took the tour itself as the organizing center of their descriptions and
produced sentences like: To the left we see the kitchen. The frame to the left relates the
information conveyed to the route of the tour. Other people organized their descriptions
around the rooms being toured and produced sentences like: The kitchen is to the left. The
frame the kitchen relates the information conveyed to the list of rooms."".",[72]
"   The final clause is the syntactic nucleus of the sentential paragraph : it is the only
obligatory part, although the other parts are almost always present. The medial chain and
often also the frame depend on the [mal clause.
    Medial-final chains are found in very many TNGP languages. S uch chains sometimes
form paragraph-like discourse chunks as in Kombai narratives but in other languages
""medial-final chains may be interpreted as sentence units which build quite regularly into
paragraphs j ust as in an Indo-European language. This is true, for example, in Manambu,
Golin, Gahuku, and Yessan-Mayo."" (Longacre 1 972:40). The relation between verb types
and sentence/paragraph boundaries in chains also varies from language to language. For
example in chains of Telefol, an Ok language, finite dependent verb forms mark the end of
the sentence and independent verbs mark the end of the paragraph (Healey 1 966).
   The frame constituent tends to be of the clausal type, although phrasal frames occur. Time
expressions in Kombai tend to take the form of clauses. There is a very restricted set of
options for the expression of frames in narratives. The overwhelming majority of frames in
narratives are either tail-head linkages or generic verb linkages or spatio-temporal phrases.
   The medial chain consists of coordinate-dependent 1 2 single verb clauses occurring in
chain-like series with a very low number of expressed arguments per verb. The medial chain
may be very long (more than 20 verbs in one chain is not unusual in both Kombai and
Wambon). The tendency to leave arguments unexpressed, to express the maintaining of
topical entities in the verb morphology and to express interclausal relations in the verb
morphology combine to make the medial chain look very 'verby' and event-oriented.
   The final clause has an independent verb as its centre; the final clause expresses the main
assertion of the sentential paragraph. The medial chain contains both asserted and non­
asserted information and all sorts of ' soft' presuppositions and assertions. The information
status of frames is to present the setting or framework for the subsequent narrative sentence
and to link it to the preceding list of events.
   We conclude this section by illustrating some of the points made above. Consider (292)
and (293). In this section there are two given topics, 'I' and 'the snake' :
(292)     U-ra          fali        mimaye-fo            fali-ra

          I hit it and carried it out and after I had put it on a piece of wood I cut its neck.",[77]
"
3.8.5 RELATIONAL VERBS
   Certain Kombai verbs (especially motion-verbs and the verb ' to do' ) frequently function
as relators.
   The verb ma- 'to do' is used relationally as follows; its 3SG.NF form, taking the OS co­
ordinator -a and used medially, mana 'he did and .. (OS) ' is used as a OS conj unction, both
inter-clausally and between sentences. When mana is used, the verb preceding it obligatorily
lacks the OS coordinator -a. Thus a OS transition is expressed either by an independent verb
form +-a or by an independent verb form + mana. In the following discourse-fragment both
types of OS transitions occur:(274)   Boluwa-n-a
        OUR. speak.against/angrily.3SG.NF-TR-CONN(OS)

(274)-(276) belong to one fragment of a story; in (274) we find a OS transition Mana with
the OS coordinator on the medially used independent verb form ilia whereas in (276) a mana
transition occurs.
   Mana is also used between sentences, as a sentence-linking device:
(277)   Khumolei-n-a                 ifamano.
        die.3SG.NF-TR-CONN (OS) bury. 3PL.NF
        He died and they buried him.
(278)   Mana      kh waimigi mene luwano: ...
        and (OS) foreigners this      say.3PL.NF
        And then the foreigners said this: . . .
60
The S S dependent form of ma- 'to do' (mora) is also used relationally, as a sentence-linker:
(279)     Rei fenadi khe kho badu luwo adiya.
          day one    he man many word give. 3SG.NF
          One day he addressed a large crowd.
(280)     Mo-ra      mali         bokha-n-a...
          do. SS-and go.down.SS OUR.go. 3SG.NF-TR-CONN (OS)
          Thus he did and he went down and ... (OS) ...
By using mana (OS ) and mora (SS) the switch-reference monitoring of subjects is continued
across sentence-boundaries.
    Orabbe ( 1 955: 1 24) has reported the relational use of the verb og 'to do' in Marind as an
interclausal conjunction meaning 'after'.
   Not only forms of ma- 'to do' but also - and much more frequently - forms of motion
verbs are used as relators.
   Especially, forms of mam- 'go.up' are extremely frequent. They function as general
discourse-cohesive conj unctions meaning something like 'and next' or ' I tell you next ' ;
sometimes they indicate inchoative aspect of the next verb; very often they are used as pause­
phenomena to give the speaker time to process the rest of his utterance. In (274) and (276)
forms of mam- occur as relators; in (274) there is an inchoative aspect ('the headman started
to hit.. . '). In (276) the pause-aspect is relevant. The speaker pauses to process the rest of
(276).
   S S forms of mam- are often used in combination with lara, the S S form of the verb la- 'to
stand (up) ' with the coordinator -ra cliticised to it; the combination mamlara has the same
general discourse-cohesive meaning as mam, namely 'and (next I tell you) '. Lara also occurs
on its own with this meaning:
(28 1 )   Fali-me       lara khorofoni-n-a
          carry-come.SS and enter. 1 PL.INT-TR-CONN (OS)
          kho domarabo anumofa-n-o-n-a...
          man many               block.the.way-TR-3PL.NF-TR-CONN (OS)
          We brought (him) and we wanted to enter but a crowd blocked our way
          and . . . (O S ) . . .
   A combination o f the relator verb maro-fo (stand.up.SS-SEQ) and -ede 'because' i s used
as a sentence linker in argumentative discourse, meaning 'therefore' :
(282)     Marofode nage       fibimonane feneme-y-a yafe-khe?
          therefore you(PL) think.2PL.F what-TR-FOC good-Q
          Therefore what do you think is right?
The dependent forms of kha- 'to go' and le- 'to stay' combine with the durative suffix
-nege- to form the relator verbs khanege and lenege, both meaning 'until'. The use of these
relator verbs implies that the verb preceding them has a prolonged duration until the event
expressed by the verb following khanege/lenege starts:
(283)     Fufurumo            kholomo-ra            lenege mam
          very.good.SUPP. S S search . S UPP.SS-and until and. next
                                                                                             61
          bofera-Ta         lefa...
          OUR.see.SS-and take.SS
          She searched very well until she saw it and took it...
In (283) lenege 'until ' also expresses the prolonged duration of the ' searching' ; a better
translation probably would be 'she searched very well until fInally she saw it and took it... '.
    The last relator verb to be mentioned here is leina ' after' which also implies completive
aspect of the verb preceding leina. Leina is the 3SG.NF medially used independent form of
lei- 'to lay ' . Leina must be preceded by an independent verb form linked to it by the
coordinating connective clitic -a. (284) is an example containing leina:
(284)     Kamar cucP I khukhu lara gana
          room wash enter.S S next bushknife
          fadef-a            leina(1ei-n-a)

3. 1 .3.3.6 NEGATION
   There are (at least) three negations with independent verbs: domo,            (fe-}... -do and
(fe-}... -madii.
   Domo is only used with the imperative negative:
(1 1 1)   Do-mo             ami-n-i!
          NEG - S UPP . S S drink-TR-IMP.SG
          Do not drink!
Domo- is a -mo derived verb (see section 3. 1 .2.8) which, in its dependent form, functions
as modifier of the next verb.
   The imperative positive has been discussed in section 3. 1 . 3 .3.4. 1 . 1 . Notice that the
imperative negative uses the future stem (e.g. ami- of mi- ' to drink ' ) whereas the imperative
positive uses the basic stem. (Compare the close relationship of future and imperative
negative in English, e.g. 'you shall not kill ').
30     (fe-)' .. -do is used to negativise the non-future; it combines only with infinitival forms.","[39, 40]"

5 .2.3.3 T HE FORM OF ADVERBIAL CLAUSES
   Relative clauses and adverbial clauses are formally very similar in Kombai. In this
respect, Kombai is a typical Papuan language (see Foley 1 986 about the formal similarity of
adverbial and relative clauses in Papuan languages). Compare (335), here repeated as (345),
and (346):
(345)    Uni berino-n-o              TO        na-biiwogo-khu
         Uni DUR.make.3PL.NF-TR-CONN thing/SUB my-parent-also         gam0        rino.
         join . S S  make. 3PL.NF
         When they built (the village) Uni, my parents also joined the work.
(346)    Gana       gu fali       kha           TO    na-gana-y-a.
         bush.knife you carry.SS go. 3 S G . NF thing my-bush.knife-TR-PRED
         The bush knife you took away, is mine.
In (345), the embedded predication, with temporal interpretation, is an RC modifier of the ro
HN: literally, it says: ' the thing that they built Uni ' ; thus Uni berino 'they built Uni' is an RC
modifying the HN TO 'thing' in (345); the modifier-head linker -0 links this prenominal
relative clause to its head noun. In (346) we also find an RC , gu fali kha ' you took away ' ,
which also modifies the TO head noun. The difference with (345) is the presence o f the
topical antecedent gana before the relative term; gu fali kha TO 'the thing that you stole' is a
restrictive apposition with respect to this topical antecedent and gu fali kha is an open
predication (the goal argument-slot has not been filled by a term) whereas in (345) the
embedded predication Uni berino is a closed predication (see Dik 1 978 for open and closed
predications).
   Another difference is that rum u 'person ' occurs as an HN in relative clauses referring to
human entities whereas adverbial clauses cannot refer to human entities. Thus the formal
differences between relative clauses and adverbial clauses follow directly from their different
functions. RCs function within relative terms that have a primary type of referents, entities.
Adverbial clauses function within predications as satellites referring to a secondary type of
entities, 'states of affairs '.
   The formal similarity between the two types of embedded predications follows from the
fact that both relative clauses and adverbial clauses are terms and are expressed according to
the preferred expression for terms in Kombai (see (ii) in section 5 . 1 ).
   The majority of Kombai adverbial clauses are topical: they (optionally) take the topic
marker mene and they occupy the clause-initial position. Relative terms with TO and rumu
also seem to be always topical. The tendency for RC and adverbial clauses to be topical is
strong in Papuan languages (Haiman 1 978, Reesink 1 987) and this common topicality
certainly explains some of the formal similarities between these two clause types in Papuan
languages (cf. Reesink 1 983b; Foley 1 986), like initial position and the presence of (often
deictic-based) topic markers. However, not all adverbial clauses are topical. Take for
                                                                                               85example (343) above, a purpose predication with focus function, with ri as its relational HN.
Formally, this adverbial clause is expressed as an RC modifier of the relational HN ri, just as
the topical adverbial clauses are RC modifiers of relational HNs like TO and wamii.
   It is clear that the formal similarities between such focus adverbial clauses and relative
clauses do not follow from common topicality. At least for Kombai we need a more general
explanatory ground for the similarities between RC and adverbial clauses: both function as
terms and this common function explains their expression according to the preferred Kombai
pattern (ii) which follows from the language-independent PEM for terms (i).
   Dik ( 1 985b) discusses the tendency for embedded predications to be expressed nominally
in terms of a principle of formal adjustment (PFA). Since embedded predications are
secondary terms, they tend to be formally adjusted to the PEM for terms. In very many
languages, the verb of the embedded predication is the primary target for formal adjustment,
leading to different degrees of nominalisation of these verbs. Instead of adjusting the verbal
predicate of the embedded predication, Kombai inserts a relational noun TO (or: ri, wamii) as
the nominal head of the secondary term (adverbial clause). Compare the Dutch embedded
time predication (347) with the Kombai temporal adverbial clause (348):
(347)    Bij zijn thuiskomst     yond hij de brief.
         upon his home.coming found he the letter
         When he came home, he found the letter.
(348)    Uni berino-n-o              TO. . .
         Uni DUR.make.3PL.NF-TR-CONN thing/SUB
         When they built Uni. ..
Whereas in (347) the formal adjustment to the PEM for terms has affected the predicate of the
time predication, in (348) we find a fully verbal form, an independent verb form, the most
'verby ' of the Kombai verb system. In (347) we find the deverbal noun thuiskomst ' the
home coming'. Dutch may also use a verbal form for the time embedded predication:
(349)    Toen hij thuis kwam. . .
         when he home came
         When he came home ...
Between fully verbal and fully nominal embedded predications, Dutch has a range of
intermediate constructions (described in Dik 1985a). Kombai does not have these options.
Only in purpose clauses with ri (cf. for example (343)), we find infinitival verb forms
instead of the independent verb forms we find in all other subordinate clauses. In many
languages we find infinitival forms in purpose clauses (Hopper & Thompson 1985). Kombai
infinitives (see section 3 . 1 . 3.5) are the least 'verby' of the Kombai verb system. But also in
these purpose clauses the nominal head of the construction is not the nominalised verb but
the relational HN rio
  There are many questions still unanswered concerning the HN-insertion strategy that
Kombai follows to give the adverbial clause a nominal form according to the PEM for terms.
   Is this cross-linguistically a marked type of formal adjustment? Does HN-insertion
frequently occur in Papuan languages?
   It could be that for Papuan languages there is a sort of prototypical expression model for
predications, both dependent and independent, demanding that they be expressed by a verb­
centered and verb-final clausal form. Of course, embedded predications function as terms
86and there is the pressure for them to confonn to the PEM for tenns. Now HN-insertion in
Kombai adverbial clauses could be viewed as a strategy to satisfy both the preferred verbal
expression of predications and the preferred nominal expression of tenns: the ro noun as the
head of the tenn and the independent verb as the head of the clausal modifier (RC) modifying
this relational HN.","[94, 95, 96]"
"
3. 1 .3.5 INFINITIVES
   There are two infinitives, the non-future infinitive and the future infinitive. The NF
infinitive consists of the basic verb-stem only. The future infinitive consists of the future
stem plus the future marker -i. Examples: the verb ne- ' to eat' with non-future infinitive ne
and the future infinitive adeni. Both infinitives and dependent verbs are non-finite forms of
the verb, that is they do not express subject person-number.
   Formally the difference between dependent verb forms and infinitives is that dependent
verbs do not express tense, whereas the infinitives express the non-future versus future
contrast. The tense-contrast in infinitives is expressed as follows: firstly, the non-future
infinitive uses the basic stem and the future infinitive the future stem, secondly the future
infinitive has the tense-marker -i. Another formal difference between dependent verbs and
infinitives is that dependent verbs may have temporal relators cliticised to them; infinitives
cannot have temporal relators attached to them.
    Functionally, dependent verbs function as the centre of the clause, as verbs, whereas
infinitives have nominal properties. For example infinitives function in nominalisations, that
is in embedded predications with nominal properties (see Chapter 5).
   When independent verbs are negated, they take the infinitival form:
(141)     Nu (gu, khe, etc.) fe-nu-do.
          I    (you, he, etc.) NEG-eat.lNF. NF-NEG
          I (you, he, etc.) do(es) not eat/did not eat.
34( 1 42)   Nu (gu, khe, etc.) fe-ade-n-i-madii.
          I   (you, he, etc.) NEG-eat.F.INF-TR-F-NEG
          I (you, he, etc.) do not want to eat! shall(will) not eat.
I have interpreted such negative predicates as in ( 1 4 1 )-(142) as nominal predicates, negated
by the negative copula elements discussed in section 3 . 1 .3.4.","[43, 44]"
