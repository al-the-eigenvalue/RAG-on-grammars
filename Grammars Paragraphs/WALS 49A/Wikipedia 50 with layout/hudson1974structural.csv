3.1    The structure of the noun-phrase
    Noun-phrases consist of a noun with or without modifiers, and the modifiers
may either precede or follow the noun, whichever of the types listed below they
belong to. The modifiers show concord of number, gender and case with the noun
in either position, and if they follow the noun they also show concord
ness, as in Arabic:
                                      ‘a                          *
                                                                        definite-
                      /tik win/ big (win) man (tik) but /?uu-tik 2uu-win/ the
                                                                                 of         *big man’. However, there are two other differences between preceding and
following modifiers:    if the modifier precedes, the noun must not contain the

       definite article (unless the modifier is one of the demonstratives, ~'n- this” or     ‘       -beén- ‘ that’): hence /win ték/* a small man’ but not */win 2au-ték/ or */2au-win
       tuu-ték/; and the modifiers have different concordial suffixes according to
       whether they precede or follow (3.2, 3.3).
          The following are
                            all found as modifiers (the examples are all in the accusative
       case):
              (i) demonstratives (¢.g. /200~'n 2oo-yaas/ or /200-yias 200-'n/ this dog’);

             (ii) adjectives (¢.g. /dabalo~"" yias/ or /vaas dubaloo~-b/ a small dog’);
                                                                           *             iv) possessives (4.1), consisting of a noun-phrase followed by a genitive’

                  required by the ‘ possessed ' noun (¢.g. /2o0~'n ?istakei-’ yaas /or /?oo-vias
                  wi-?oo-'n Yi-tak-ii-’b/ this man’s dog’, with      or    as genitive suffix) ;
                                            *
                                                                 -i-           -i-              (v) relative clauses (9), consisting of a   clause to which (or rather to whose
                  verb) are suffixed the gender /number /case markers required by the head-
                  noun (the antecedent °), with or without the suffix -e- before such markers

                  I saw’); if the head noun contains the definite article, the relative clause
                  must follow and     itself  have the article prefixed to the whole clause,
                  according to the     normal  rules for modifiers given above (e.g. /2o0-yaas
                  wi-?ane-"" rih-a-n-ee-'-b/ the dog that I saw ’).

       3.2     Gender
           There are two genders, masculine and feminine, which are determined
)      arbitrarily for inanimate nouns and according to sex for animates. The formal
       distinction between the two may be made at one or none of several different places
       in the noun-phrase, Feminine noun-phrases always contain at least one instance
       of the feminine marker -t- (which is also found in nearly all feminine verbs), and
       masculine noun-phrases may or may not contain an instance of the masculine-
       -and-accusative marker -b-. The rules for using these markers are as follows :
             ( feminine -
                 —always prefixed to definite articles and demonstratives containing ~'n-
                    “this”;
                 —always suffixed to any other modifier ;
                 —suffixed to the noun-stem before a possessive pronoun suffix (5.1) ;

                 —otherwise suffixed to noun-stems provided there is no definite article or
                    preceding modifier.

                 —added to nouns and modifiers only if they otherwise end in a vowel and

    The distinction between singular and plural noun-phrases is shown        in the
stems of nouns and adjectives, (b) in the accents of nouns and modifiers of various
                                                                                      (a)                     cases are

    (@) Noun and adjective stems: the main marker of
                                                         plurality is the suffix -a-                   Reinisch,      1893   :
(c.g. /ragéd/* a leg’, /raged-aa-'-b/ ‘legs *), Not       all
                                                     nouns and adjectives take this                    for genitival
plural marker, however; another common one is the shortening of                 final  the             by the vowel
vowel    in
          a consonant-final root (e.g. /ginwit/ ‘a nose’, /gimit/‘ noses’). Roots                      masculine, of -b,
ending in a vowel generally make no distinction between singular and plural
other than the accent change described below.
   (6) Accents: if a noun
                               or
                               adjective ends, in the plural, in a vowel (irrespective
of whether this vowel is the plural marker -a- or part of the root), it always has a
penultimate accent (1.4) (which is also characteristic of plural verbs—see 8).
Otherwise, accents are cither the same in singular and plural (e.g. /einutt/,
/sinit/ nose(s)’), or contrast in either direction (e.g. /oarriad/, /oarréd/ ‘ tea-
             *
pots)’; /bikkéar/, /bikkir/         *

             Inflectionsarticles and possessive suffixes: the following pattern of
 vowels is found both in articles (which are prefixed to the noun) and in possessive
suffixes (which are suffixed to it)—and also in the demonstrative ~'n- ‘this "":

These distinctions are made whenever the vowel concerned is long: in articles
when the rest of the noun or adjective is
                                            monosyllabic (e.g. /2uu-yaas /* the dog ’),
and in suffixes where the following person-marker (5.1) has a final accent (e.g.
 /2-yaas-un-'k/* your dog’); otherwise the vowel           is i-
                                                           for all cases and numbers.
Singular and plural are also distinguished in the definite article if the following
word starts with /2/ or /h/, in that the article is then introduced by /w/ in the
 singular and /y/in the plural (e.g. /wi-hada-""/* the lion °, /yi-hada-""/* the lions ’).?®

 Reinisch, 1893 : 80, Roper, 1928 : 14), and the accusative is also used as the basis
for genitival constructions (4). They are distinguished formally from one another

 5.1     Possessive pronoun suffixes
    Possessive pronoun suffixes are added to the noun that refers to what is
possessed (e.g. /2i-gaw-uu-'k/* your (""k) house’). The noun to which a possessive
suffix is added may or may not have a definite article as well (cf. /gaw-uu-'k/
*a house of yours”). Before the possessive suffix there is a marker of case and
number, namely one of the vowels which also occur in the definite article (see
3.3c):
                                                 Singular                   Plural

 Before the case/number marker there is the feminine marker -t- if the noun is
feminine (¢.g. /ti-huus-aa-t-aa-’k/          ‘
                                     your knives’).
       The possessive pronoun suffixes are as follows :

     Similarly, if an inseparable postposition (see 4.2) is attached to a noun that
has possessive pronoun suffix the postposition comes first (¢.g. /ti-?oor-bii-s-oo-'k/

shows concord with the noun to which the possessive suffix is attached. (If the                                 Although there is

relative clauses), and the possessive suffix again is preceded by the appropriate
case-number marker (and feminine -t-) required by the adjective or relative clause
(e.g. /dabalo-""kaa-t-oo-""k ?oor/ ‘a girl smaller (dabalo-""kaa-t-oo-) than you (‘k);
 /Nisktden-hedb-kaa-t-o0-'k 2oor/ ‘a girl who knows (ticktden-) me (-heéd-) more
(-kaa-) than you (k)’).
5.2.  Independent personal pronouns
       following are the independent personal pronouns, which are optional as
       ‘Thesubjects and alternatives to object pronoun suffixes (see 5.3 below) as objects :

suffixes are used, since the case-number marker distinguishes singular from plural
(eg. /oar-nu-'/“he’, /bar-aa-'/* they’). The genitive morpheme is added in the
‘usual way, after -bar and the feminine               -t
                                            (e.g. /bar-bii-oo~'k-geeb/ with (-geeb)

5.3.       Object pronoun suffixes
    Object pronoun suffixes are added to verbs, immediately after any tense and
 person/number affixes (e.g. /2aree-é-ni-hook/ I like (?aree-d-ni-) you (-hook) ).!7
                                                                *‘Their forms are as follows :

    Although there is no obligatory gender distinction for object pronoun suffixes,
there is a rather odd optional gender distinction according to the addressee's sex
which can be made by adding -a- (masc.) or -i- (fem.) to a Ist person (sing./plur.)
or 2nd person singular object suffix (e.g. /2uu-yaas tam-yi-hetb-a/ (said to a man),
‘/uu-yias tam-yi-hedb-i/ (said to a woman) the dog bit me’). (Almkvist, 1881:
                                                            *242-3, Reinisch, 1893: 109, Roper, 1928 : 29.)
    There are three special cases where the forms listed above are not used but
are replaced by others :
      (i After the future suffix -t- (see 7.2, 8.1) they are the same as the possessive
          suffixes with the accusative singular marker -oo- before them (e.g. /dir-
          oo-'k/* I'll kill you’).
     (i) If the clause is used adverbially, with a genitive’ morpheme -e- suffixed
                                                                    *

                  its
                 verb (see 10.2), again the object pronoun suffixes are the same as
          the possessive suffixes, and are preceded either by the nominative singular
          -nu- (meaning, in this environment,            (e.g. /?ane-' rih-a-ny-ce-un-'k/

          ‘if [see (ane-"" rih-a-ny) you’)                   or
                                                      by the accusative singular -00-
          (€.g. /Yane-""rih-a-ny-ee-00-'k-hoob/ when I see you’).
                                                        *
    (iii) If the clause is relative, the form of an object pronoun suffix in the verb
          is again that of the possessive suffix, with a case-number marker to suit

      In Halanga (Roper,
       4                       1928
                                       the object suffix may be added to an auxiliary rather than
                                             41)

  You aren't-me having-bitten ’).
     ‘In Arteiga and Hadendowa (Roper, taken 1928 : 29) the 3rd person object suffix is zero, so that
‘a verb with no overt object suffix can

“Llike him /her/it/them ""); however, in Halanga (Roper, 1928 : 29) and Beni Amer (Reinisch,
 1893 : 109) the 3rd person object pronoun suffixes are /hoos/ (sing.) and /hoos-na/ (plur.), and
‘in Bishari (Almkvist, 1881 : 110) they are /hooh/ or /ooh/ and /hooh-na/ or /ooh-na/—ct. the

                    dabiil~a) a friend of ours money’.
      Similarly, postpositional constructions (4.2), adverbial clauses (10) and other
 adverbial constructions occur before the verb, though they may not be as restricted
  positionally as are $ and C. According to Reinisch (1893: 73) the agent in a
 passive construction (2.4, 7.7) occurs with the postposition which normally
 means from ’, and is put between S and
             ‘                                                         V
                                                  (e.g. /wichada-’ Yi-yaas-ii-’ 2i-too-déar/
 “the lion (wichada-') was killed (2i-too-déar) by the dog (i-yaas-ii-’)’),
     The verb shows concord with the subject in person, number and gender (7.2),
 and no subject is in fact necessary—for instance,                   all
                                                               the sentences listed in the
 previous paragraph     with              ‘
                              /bar-uu-’k/ you’ as subject      could have had no subject
 at all with no change in either grammaticality or meaning, beyond a change of
  emphasis. The complement—or rather one of the complements—may be repre-
  sented by a suffix attached to the verb (5.3), and again if such a suffix is present
 no separate C is needed even                   if
                                       one is understood semantically (e.g. /ti-kteen-
  “arhedb/* You know (ti-kteen-""a-) me (-hedb) °), The 3rd-person complement suffixes

 116                                       R. A. HUDSONhave no realization, except under rather special grammatical circumstances, so
there may be no overt reflex at all of a complement that is understood (e.g.
 /Aickteen-'a/ You know him/her /it/them *).
               *    The order S-C-V given above
are possible   and
                                      is
                                     only the normal order, from which deviations
                   quite common, apparently for reasons of emphasis and the like.
However, this is more true of main clauses than of subordinate clauses, since in
the latter the verb is almost always the last element, due to the rule that any
subordinating markers, corresponding                to
                                            subordinating conjunctions in English,
take the form of suffixes added directly to the verb (9, 10); since this suffix really             j“belongs   to   the whole clause,     it
                                   is natural for it to be kept on the edge
clause by keeping the verb itself at the end.
                                                                                   the of
2.2.   Predicative constructions
      In predicative constructions, the element referred to as ‘the verb’, and
 represented in the formula above by V, may be either a proper verb (viz. a form
of the irregular verb    -k-y-
                                 ‘
                                   be ’) or a ‘ copular clitic’ (6), based on the morpheme
-a-, which also means be’, but having a completely different kind of paradigm
from verbs. These two sets of forms are in complementary distribution: the
 clitics are used in sentences that are positive, present tense and not embedded in
 another sentence (i.e. in the most straightforward kinds of sentence), and the
 verbs are used in all other kinds    of        sentence. Compare the following for instance :
                    /dabaloo-’-beu/        is
                                           ‘ He
                                            *
                                                    small (dabaloo-'-b=)
                                                                   *                     /Aabaloo-'-b 7i-kti/ He used to be (2ii-ktt) small     ”                    /Aabaloo~=b i’-li-ké/ He isn’t small °
                                                *                    /Aabaloo-’-b ?i-katii-ee-""k/ ‘ If he is small’
      In some respects the copular clitic is like a suffix: for instance, it causes
 preceding short vowels to lengthen, and can even impose its own accent on the
complement, showing that         it     is in the same accent-unit. On the other hand, it is
less closely attached to the complement than a suffix would be: for instance, it
does not count as a syllable of the complement noun as far as the rule that
determines the length of the article is concerned (3.3c). Moreover,
                                                                                it
internal structure, consisting of from one to three morphemes (¢.g. /t-oo-ndees't-
                                                                                     has its ownuu-y/ ‘You (fem.) are               (e'-uw-y) the mother (-oo-ndees) ’), rather
                                                                                   more like an
independent verb. The grammatical status of a copular clitic is thus ambiguous
between that of an affix and that of a word, and          this                         to
                                                                       ambiguity is meant
reflected both by the term ‘clitic’ and by the sign *s’ separating it from the
                                                                                              becomplement   (in    contrast with the morpheme-boundary ‘-’ and the word-space).
     The complement   in    a predicative construction may be of two types :
      () a normal accusative form of an adjective, a noun-phrase, a relative clause
          (e.g. /saa-'-t tam-ii-nii-""b/ who (-""b) eats (tam-ii-nii-) meat (saa-’-t)*), or a
                                       *          possessive (¢.g. /beén Yictakeii~’b/ that man (beén Zctak-)'s (-ii’b)      ’);
                                                     *

              Different forms of the copular clitic are found with these two types of com-
              plement (6).
                 One frequent
                              use of the predicative construction, with either a copular clitic
              or a verb, according       to
                                       the usual rules, is to form the equivalent of an English
              pseudo-cleft ' sentence, like What men drink is coffee” or Why he did it was
                                                    *                                   *              because he needed the money’: /wi-?aa-nda-"" g""a?-ee-n-e-"" biunsu/ Which                 *

                   ‘An ‘auxiliary verb’ may follow the ‘main verb’, in which case the main
              verb may be severely restricted in its grammatical form, and may assume a form
              that is not possible in the absence of an auxiliary verb. Consequently such con-
              structions may be assumed to have an embedded sentence (containing the main
              verb and any complements it may have) as complement                  of the
                                                                                 auxiliary verb.
              For instance, in the sentence /?uu-ték saa~'-t tam-l ?i-ndi/ the man (?uu-tak) will
                                                                                   *              (ti-nai, which elsewhere means “ says”) eat (tam-1, which can mean    let me eat ”)

           constructions there are also lexical restrictions on the combinability of
           particular main verbs and auxiliary verbs (except for -ba?-, here meaning
           “keep on’, which seems to combine freely with all main verbs), and also
           on the meaning    of the  resultant combinations.

    Verbs have up
                     to five distinct derived forms (7.7, 8.2), which help to distinguish
a number of sentence-types (at least seventeen, according to Hudson (1973a:
539-48). These may contain more than one complement,
relations to the verb. Distinguishable types include the following :

(e.g. /ké-tam-a-'n/ ‘I don’t eat’), since the unit of distribution for accents is the
 accent-unit, not the word (Hudson, 1973b). An accent-unit is a sequence of one
‘or more complete morphemes, comprising at least one syllable, within which only
‘one accented syllable is permitted ; that
                                              is,
                                               if more than one of   the    morphemes
has an inherent accent (indicated in the dictionary of morphemes), only one of
these inherent accents can be realized (e.g. in /tam-a-n-ee-'k/ ‘if I ate’, both
~'n- ‘1’ and ~’k-* if"" have inherent accents, but since both are in the same accent-
unit only one accent can be realized,   in
                                        this case that of ~'k-; cf. /tam-a-'n/* Tate’).
In general, the principle underlying the choice of accent   to   be realized is that the
later of two inherent accents in the same accent-unit  is  realized.
     The position and nature of    the realized accent is determined by the word's
 morphological structure, and is not predictable (pace Reinisch, 1893: 55 and
Almkvist, 1881 : 57) from its purely phonological structure (e.g. /ti-rib-'a/ ‘ you
 refused ', but /ti-dif-a/ you went’, whose roots belong to different accentual
                          ‘
classes but are otherwise morphologically the same). A morpheme may or may
not have an inherent accent, but  if     it does, there are two further variables to be
 specified : the position of the accentual reference-point (usually on a vowel in the
last syllable of the morpheme) and      the   position of the accented vowel relative
to this reference-point, allowing us to speak of final accent (on the reference-
point itself) and penultimate accent (on the syllable—or mora—before the
  reference-point). For simplicity we can show these two variables together in
the transcription, by using for final accent and for penultimate accent, and
                              ‘                        *
locating these accent-marks on the reference-point itself Thus, /kitiab/*a book”
has phonetic high pitch on the first syllable, although this pitch is indicated by
the penultimate accent-mark on the second
                                                 syllable. By convention, the accentual
reference-point can be taken as the vowel over which the accent-mark is written,
if there is such a vowel, and as the first vowel to the left of the accent-mark if
there is not; this allows the accentual influence of a morpheme
                                                                     to     extend back
over several other morphemes (e.g. in /ticrib-'a/ ‘you refused, the accent is
determined by the third morpheme,
 second morpheme, and  its
                                         its                is
                                               reference-point     on the vowel of the
                               realization, as high pitch, is on the first morpheme)..
    A penultimate accent is always realized on the syllable before the one con-
taining the reference-point, provided there is such a syllable in the same accent-
unit; but if  there is none, but there is a vowel before the reference-point in the
same syllable, then it is on this vowel that the high pitch is located ; finally, if
there is no such vowel, then the high pitch is located on the vowel acting as
reference-point, and extends forward over any later vowel      in the same syllable.
In the first case, the phonetic result is a sequence of syllables with a high pitch

by a final accent (e.g. /k*aa-'-t/ ‘a sister), and the difference is seen only when
a prefix is added to which the realization of the penultimate accent can be

7.3.      Negative concordial forms
       The following classes of negative verb also show concord with the subject :
          () Free negative (only used in non-embedded declarative clauses, e.g.
              /e-adedbil/* I don’t collect *, /kéctam-ae'n /*I don’t eat *);
         ii)  Bound negative (used in embedded or imperative clauses, or depending
              on an auxiliary: /b-as-dabiil-ee-’k/ ‘if I don’t collect’, /bien-dabifl/
              “let's not collect’, /b-aa-dabifl 2a-ndi/ ‘I intend not to collect’);
        (iii) Negative imperative (e.g. /b-aé-dabiiln/ don't collect ', /b-a-tam-ta/

Free and bound negatives allow overall the full range of subjects, but negative
imperatives allow only 2nd person subjects. Notice that the free and bound
 negatives correspond in meaning

          negative consists of a negative prefix added to the preterite form of base) ;
to negate other tenses it is necessary to use auxiliaries (¢.g. /tam-aa-'-b keil-ke/
serves as negative for (a) /tam-aa-""beu/ ‘he has eaten’, (b) /tam-y-4/ ‘he ate’,
(©) /tam-i/ he used to eat).

7.4       Non-concordial forms
       The following forms of base do not show concord with the subject :
         (i) Past participle (e.g. /Aibl-aa~’/, /tam-2a-'/ having collected /eaten *);
                                                            *

       (iv) Negative adverbial participle (e.g. /b-ai-dabisl/, /b-adetam-ty/ without
                                                                                *
              collecting /eating *) ;
        ()   Bound participle (used only before continuative ~t- ‘and’ or before
              auxiliaries—see 2.3—e.g. /aibil-ti-’ tam-y-A/‘ having collected it he ate it
             /sam-ee-ti ba?-4-nt/ ‘I keep on cating’).

       However, although the base itself does not show subject concord, some of
          forms (Past participle and Negative adjectival participle) can be used with
          ival gender and case-number markers affixed to them, and before copular
           which distinguish person as well, so that concord is shown with the subject,
             not in the verb base (¢.g. /dibl-aa~bsu/ ‘he has collected ' (lit. he is
                                                                                    *

     In 7.2-7.4 above we distinguished 15 classes of stem, not counting the ’distine-

stem. These base classes are distinguished from one another partly by the form
of their stems, and partly by the prefixes and suffixes attached to the stem, as canbe seen clearly from the paradigms in the following section. Considering only the                           bination of (a.

object pronoun suffixes (e.g. /?i-rabe-"" wi-?ane-"" ?a-s-dabil-ee-uu-'k kee-y-&/ ‘ Where
is (kee-y-8) the luggage (?i-rabe-"") which T (?ane-') caused (-s-) you (-'k) to collect

you

the verbs of adjectival clauses, such as the presence of a suffix -n- in the Preterite
of weak stems          (i.
                         -y-a-n- instead of -y-a-, etc.).

     It is worth noting that the usual way of negating a Preterite or Past verb is to              -tay- or
use the Past participle in a predicative adjectival clause, with the negative of -k-y-
‘be’ (e.g. /ticrabe-’ dibl-aa~’d keai-kd/ *I didn’t collect the luggage’, literally
“I'm not having-collected the luggage’). This form is thus the negative corre-
 sponding not only to a clause where the only difference is that the negative of
-k-y-is replaced by     itspositive equivalent (a copularclitic)(e.g. /2i-rabe-""dibl-aa~'beu/
‘T have collected the luggage), but also to simple clauses containing Preterite
verbs (e.g. /?i-rabe-’ 2a-dbil/* I collected the luggage ’) or Past verbs (c.g. /Pi-rabe-""      the otherwise
‘iieabil/* I used to collect the luggage ’).                                                    pronoun suffix

10.2       With postpositions
     Postpositions rather similar to the postpositions that can be added to noun-

phrases (4.2) can also be added to clauses ; and just as the genitive morpheme
~i- or -e- has to be added to a noun-phrase before the postpositions are added,
                                                                                *
so a morpheme -e- has to be added to clauses before postpositions can be added
to these. There are a number of other distributional similarities between this
morpheme and the ‘ genitive” morpheme, so we shall refer to it as the genitive
                                                                                    *             *morpheme below (cf. for example /wi-?oor-li-oo-""k-geeb/ with (-geeb) your son

morpheme is suppressed when there is an Object pronoun suffix such as -00-""k-
“you (for whose form, see 5.3), and there are even differences in the form of
the Object pronoun suffix itself from one postposition to another (cf. /2ane-""

    The following are the postpositions that can be added to clauses in this way :

10.3.   With temporal suffixes
    The following suffixes can all be translated either as ‘ then     or as ‘ when or
                                                                            *               *“after” (c.g. /rih-a-n-dayt-hook yak-a-n/ ‘I saw you then (-dayt-) I got up
(vakea~'n) or /yak-a-'n rih-a-n-dayt-hook/ ‘I got up when I saw you’). Unlike
the otherwise similar suffixes discussed in 4 below, these precede the Object
pronoun suffix (-hook- you’ in the above examples) and they lead to the loss of
                             *a short /i/ in the final syllable of       the
                                         verb base (e.g. /2a-s-dabl-aayt/‘ after I made
him collect it ', but /2a-s-dabil-aayt/‘ because I made him collect it’). Moreover,
an optional -aayt- may be added, without change of meaning, after an Object
pronoun suffix (e.g. /tam-is-ti-ny-aat-hedb-aayt/ or /tam-is-ti-ny-aat-hedb/ after
she feeds me’).
    The   temporal suffixes are:
        ( ~t   (tite after a plural suffix -n-): unrestricted in distribution, but
          particularly common after the Bound participle (e.g. /tam-eet-ii-'t diw-a-'n /
          “Having eaten I went            to
                                        sleep’);
            lit:  only after Past verbs
    (iii) -aayt-: only after Preterite verbs ; ;
    (iv) -dat-: only after Present or Past verbs.

    (@         tive or Negative imperative, or (sometimes)     if  verb is Future,
          Permissive or Bound negative (¢.g. /araaw-oo-'nsw-aa-ay tam-s-am-da-hoon /
                                                                                                }
         “Since (-y) you're our friend (?araaw-oo-'nsw-aa-) eat with us (tam-s-am-
           ‘’ta-hoon) *).
       (ii) -aayt- (or -yt- or ~dayt-): never used if the main clause’s verb is Imperative
            or Negative imperative, but otherwise unrestricted (e.g. /araaw-o0-'n=w-
            au-aayt 2i-gaw-au-'n bari-oo-'ksu/ Since (-aayt-) you're our friend our

junction (‘and’) or disjunction (“ or’), and whether the co-ordinates are words,
phrases or clauses (c.g. /bayho-’ anoo-ti-’ Yoér 2im-oo-re-ram-'na/ ‘A jackal

of   co-ordination is used at all, it is one of the following :
        (i) -wa-   ‘and’: suffixed to the first co-ordinate and, sometimes, to the
            second too (¢.g. /Panee-'-wa bar-uu-'k-wa/ or /?anee-""-wa bar-un-’k/     ‘and
            you’). Used when the co-ordinates are words or phrases, or embedded
            clauses with postpositions attached (e.g. /ti-m?ari-’ tam-a-ny-ee-""k-wa                 |            ‘oo-bitun g¥a?-a-ny-ee~""k-wa/ ‘if I eat (tam-a-ny-ee~'k-) the food (ti-m2ari-')

                   with no apparent meaning, suffixed to verbs before certain auxiliaries
            (c.g.  /m2ariin't  mirii-tii'wa ba?-A-ni/ or /m?arti-’t miriitl ba2-t-nt/* I keep
            on   (ba2-t-n!)  finding  food (m?arii-’t miri-ti(i)-) ”).
       (ii) -han-   ‘or’:     suffixed       first
                                         to the       of two co-ordinates (e.g. /hadb-han

            wine (?adar-badb) ?""). Apparently used as a co-ordination marker only

 The modifier in such constructions consists              of a noun-phrase (identifying the
 possessor), to which is attached first a genitive suffix (+- in the above examples),
                                                 *         °
 and then whatever suffixes are needed to show concord with the head noun
 (ie. the possessed). The possessor noun-phrase is itself in the accusative case.
      The genitive suffix itself differs according to the number of the noun-phrase to
  which it is suffixed : in simple cases, it     is  “after a singular, and -e- after a plural

"7.7     Derivation
      The main formal indication of
of the verb’s stem. There is no simple
                                       a   sentence’s derivation type (2.4) is the form
                                                    relationship between the sentence-
                                                    1:
                                                             1types and the stem-classes—for instance, reflexive sentences do not always have
verbs with the same kind of stem, and some kinds of stem that can appear in
reflexive sentences can also appear in passive sentences. To avoid confusion,
terms like reflexive will therefore not be used to refer to types of stem; instead,
              ‘         ’we shall use morphologically-based terms like ‘S-form’. An added advantage
of this approach is that it does not commit us                   in
                                                         advance to using the same  set    of
distinctions for strong and weak stems : there is a lot of similarity, but there are
also important differences.
     In weak stems, there are just two suffixes that mark derivation: -s- (/iis/
after /s/ or /s/) and -am- (/m/      after     vowels). These occur singly or together,
giving the following derivational types      :
       (i) Underived:    used in underived sentence types ;
                      used  in causative sentence types (e.g. /raat-s-ee~'n/ they cause

           ee-'n/ ‘they ask themselves”) or in passive types (¢.g. /rant-am-0e-'n/
           “they are asked’), but also in underived sentence types, if the radical       is
           adjectival (e.g. /2eegrim-am-ee-'n/ they become grey ’);

8.2.     Derived forms
       Al that we need to give for the derived forms is the seven (or less) forms of
the stem, as defined in 7.5. In order to construct a derived form, find the relevant
 underived form in the paradigms above and replace the root by the appropriate
stem given below. The only adjustments that need to be made will be in the
subject-concord prefixes : before a vowel, all vowels in these prefixes are deleted
(as in the Past forms for II and III). Since weak and strong stems allow different,
ranges of stem-forming affixes (7.7), they will be treated separately. Accents will
be omitted, since they are as in the paradigms above.","[22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"

noun’ -na- attached to it may itself follow its head-noun, and that the whole
noun-phrase that they make up between them may itself                                  be
                                                                   treated as a possessor—
which may itself have -na- added. This allows up to two occurrences of                  -na-                       the
 suffix next to each other, though each belongs to a different layer of structure
(c.g. /ticbasba-"" 2i-wi-?06r 200-win-nas-ii-naa-i-’ giw/ ‘the big boy's father’s
house’), However, two seems to be the upper limit to the number of -na-'s that
‘can occur together in this way.
4.2.            Postpositions
      Instead of the suffixes showing concord with a possessed head-noun, there
may be after the genitive suffix one           of
                                              a number of postpositions which give
the noun-phrase an adverbial function (e.g. /wi-?oorii-t/ like the boy’). The

                                                                                                               ,
rules for the form of the genitive morpheme itself, the feminine -t- before it, and
the pseudo-noun -na- before that, apply exactly in the way described in 4.1.
     There are two classes of postposition, according to their position relative to a
 possessive pronoun suffix (5.1) belonging          to
                                                   the head-noun of the noun-phrase to
 which the postposition is attached. Those postpositions that would precede such
a pronoun we shall call inseparable, and those that would follow it separable.
‘The
     inseparable ones are the following ¥:
                           (zero before a pronoun suffix): ‘in, about”;
                           i)                     ~’b-
                           (/'t/ before a pronoun suffix): like’;
                          (/s/ before a pronoun suffix): from, by”.
                                                                                   *This last postposition may be followed by the morpheme -ka- (Which follows the
pronoun suffix), and the meaning is then either than or since’.

      Reinisch, 1893 : 76-80, adds two more postpositions that are, presumably, inseparable :
~'na- with and -nee- since *. Before them,

                               the radical is consonantal but only has two consonants,
      the intensified stem is weak, not strong; moreover, intensification by

      ing does not apply at all     if

      to be considered here are those with three consonants.","[26, 27]"
