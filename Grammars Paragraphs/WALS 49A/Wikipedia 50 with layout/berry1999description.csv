4. 1 COREGRAMMAR ANDGRAMMATlCALRELATIONS
   The basic word order of an Abun clause, like all other West Papuan Phylum languages, is
SUBJECT VERB OBJECT.
   Firstly, in regard to subjects, Andrews ( 1 985: 1 04) points out that in a great many
languages a subject grammatical relation is clearly marked by the coding features of ordinary
main clauses. For example, in English, subjects are primari ly marked by the coding feature
of preverbal position, and in some limited cases indicated by case marking and cross­
referencing. Abun subjects are similar to English because they are clearly encoded by word
order. No case-marking or other coding devices signify an Abun subject. Rather, Abun
subjects are always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately precedes the
verb.
   The direct object in an Abun transitive clause is also encoded by word order alone. The
Abun object is always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately follows the
verb, except in certain contexts where the object can be fronted (see §4.7.2).
   According to Andrews ( 1 985:69), the first step in analysing the system of grammatical
relations in a language is to identify A, S, and 0, where A is transitive subject (prototypically
an agent), S is intransitive subject (either agent or patient) and 0 is transitive object
(prototypically a patient). Typologically languages differ according to how these grammatical
relations group. Nominative/accusative systems combine A and S functions, whereas
absolutive/ergative systems combine S and 0 functions.
   On this basis, Abun is a nominative-accusative language since it combines the S and A
functions. Abun combines S and A on a syntactic level, the syntactic coding being word
order. S and A precede the verb, whereas 0 follows the verb. In an intransitive clause, a

subject (A) precedes the verb and an object (0) fol lows, as in 4.2.
   4. 1        Men      kas.
               1 PL     run
               SUBJECf VffiB
               We ran .
   4.2         Men      gwa      Isak.
               1 PL     hit      Isak
               SUBJECf VffiB     OBJECf
               We hit Isak.
   Morphologicall y the constituents of noun phrases are the same, irrespective of the
grammatical role filled by the noun phrases. In example 4.2 the subject of the transitive
clause (A) is first person plural, while an identical form is also the object (0) of 4.3 and
subject of the intransitive c lause (S) in 4. 1 . All Abun pronouns are invariant in form, whether
they refer to the subject, object or possessor. See Table 3 . 1 4 in §3.4.4 for a ful l list of
pronouns.
   4.3         Isak      gwa     men.
               Isak      hit     1 PL
               SUBJECf VffiB     OBJECf
               Isak hit us.
   Most other grammatical relations, including that of dative, are encoded by the use of
prepositions. In addition to being encoded by prepositions, word order is stil l fairly rigid. For
example, dative, where present, follows an object and precedes other prepositional phrases .
Locative phrases with the preposition m o usually fol low a l l other prepositional phrases.
   Free-form adverbs or adverbial phrases which express time or location are free from the
otherwise rigid word order of the Abun clause, with the exception that they cannot occur
preceding the direct object (see §4.4. 1 ).
   Thus, an Abun main clause consists of:
          (ADJUNCTS) SUBJECf VERB (DIRECr OBJECf) (INDIRECr OBJECf) (ADJUNCTS) (PARTICLES)
   Adj uncts include free-form adverbs or adverbial phrases and various prepositional phrases
expressing associative, instrumental, benefactive and the like. The subject is obligatory and i s
rarely elided, even in subordinate clauses. Particles may optionally occur clause-finally to
indicate polarity, aspect, modality or mood. A detailed discussion of these particles is the
subject of the chapters 6, 7 and 8 of this work.
   Objects may be topicalised by fronting. Adj uncts expressing location or time may also be
fronted and thereby precede the subject in certain contexts (see §4.7 below). Those
expressing time usually precede the subject, whereas those expressing location are only
fronted on rare occasions.
50                                                                                            CHAPTER 44.2 ABUN AND lHE GRAMMATICAL RElATIONS HJERARON
   Blake ( 1 990: 1 ) summarises some of the basic notions of relational grammar and includes
a discussion of grammatical relations that can be arranged in a hierarchy, namely subject,
object, indirect object and obliques (that is, adjuncts). Each level of the hierarchy can be
distinctly marked; for example, the presence of case marking or adpositions tends to be
associated with the oblique end of the hierarchy.
   In arranging the grammatical relations of the Abun language in a hierarchy, it can be seen
that each level is marked in a distinct way, as listed in Table 3 . 1 8 below. First, the subject is
marked by word order; it is simply preverbal. Second, the object also is marked by word
order; it is postverbal. Next, at the level of indirect object, a change in marking takes place.
Higher in the hierarchy, word order alone marks the grammatical relations, but for indirect
objects and obliques grammatical relations are marked by prepositions, with word order
taking a secondary role.","[60, 61, 62]"
"
10    These conjunctions are described in detail in Chapter I I .
II    See Chapter 5 where the possessive marker bi is analysed as a possessive linker.
12    This is not to rule out the possibility that the relative conjunction gata may not be a true linker.
      However its overall behavioural charateristics indicate that it is a conjunction and not just a
      particle found only in relative clauses.
152                                                                                             CHAPTER 99.5 RELATIVECLAUSE FDRMAnON STRAlEGY
   In any relative construction, the noun phrase that is denoted 'head' holds a gramm atical
relation in both clauses of that construction, namely in the main clause and in the relative
clause. Cross-linguistically, it appears that there is more significant variation in encoding the
grammatical relation of the head in the embedded clause, than is found in the main clause
(Comrie 1 989: 147, 1 53). Comrie distinguishes four major strategies for encoding the head
within the relative clause. These he terms non-reduction, pronoun retention, relative pronoun
and gap (Comrie 1989: 147). Non-reduction means ""that the head noun appears in full,
unreduced form, in the embedded sentence, in the normal position and/or with the normal
case marking"". With pronoun retention, the head noun is represented in the embedded clause
as a pronoun. When a relative pronoun is used, it is in clause-initial position and it is marked
for case. With any of these three strategies the role of the head noun within the relative clause
is overtly indicated ( 1 989 : 1 5 1 ). The fourth strategy, however, does not provide any overt
indication at all of the role of the head within the relative clause. The head is actually omitted
from the relative clause. For this reason it is called a gap strategy. A study of Abun relative
clause structure shows that Abun uses the fourth strategy in Comrie' s list, the gap strategy.
   Abun does not make any overt reference to the head noun within the restricting clause.
The embedded clause does not retain a pronoun referring to the head noun, nor is there a
relative clause pronoun which specifically refers to the head noun, nor is there a full noun
phrase inside the embedded clause. The head is omitted in the restricting clause, thereby
creating a gap. But since the restricting clause does not contain any reference to the head
noun, how can one know what grammatical relation the relativised argument holds?
  As explained in Chapter 4, Abun does not actually mark the case of nouns. The
gramm atical relations of Subject, Object and so on are normally marked by word order.
Therefore, it is the word order of the relative clause and the location of the gap created by the
omission of the head that provide the clues for encoding the gramm atical relation of the head.
For example:
     9.22      M e mu gu y e        gato man siri     su    men bi     nggon.
               I PL go kill person RFL do wrong with I PL POSS woman
               We (will) go (and) kill the person who has slept with our woman (woman
               from our clan).
   In example 9.22 above the restricting clause following gato contains no subject. There is a
gap between the relative conjunction gato and the verb phrase man siri 'do wrong' ,
indicating that the embedded clause contains no overt subject. Therefore the grammatical
relation of the head ye 'person' within the restricting clause is subject. Compare this example
with the relation of the relativised argument in example 9.23:
     9.23      Ii nut-bot            ye      galo ji         i-wa                ne.
               I SG thought-about person RFL            I SG happY-TRs           DEY
               I thought about the person that I liked.
   Here there is a gap after the verb iwa 'like', even though the transitive suffix -wa indicates
that this verb is a transitive verb. Therefore in this case the head ye 'person' is interpreted as
having the grammatical relation of object in the relative clause. 1 3
13    It is to be noted here that this clause also contains a determiner which will be discussed i n §9.S. 1
      below. The determiner i s more common when the head has the grammatical relation o f object.
RELATNE CLAUSES                                                                                1539.5. 1 THE ROLE OF mE DETERMINER
   It was said in §9. 1 above that some restncl1ve relative clauses are closed with a
determiner. The demonstrative pronouns re 'this' and ne 'that' have several functions in
Abun and one of these is to behave as a determiner. Unlike English determiner usage it is not
obligatory to use the determiner after a noun in Abun.","[163, 164, 165]"

5.3 POSSESSNE PHRASES
   Abun has two types of possessive constructions which, in other languages, have been
referred to as 'alienable' and 'inalienable' possession (Crystal 1 985: 1 2). Alienable
possession is that type of possession where the item possessed (hereafter known as
possessum) is seen as having only a temporary or non-essential dependence on the
possessor, such as 'his house' or 'the woman ' s book' . On the other hand, inalienable
possession is where the possessum has a permanent or necessary relationship with the
possessor such as ' her arm ' .
   O f the ten different genitive construction types discussed b y Croft ( 1 990:28-32), Abun
makes use of only two, and uses them to distinguish between alienable and inalienable
possession. The first of these construction types used in Abun is simple j uxtaposition of two
noun phrases; one representing the possessor and one representing the posses sum. This type
of construction is used to form Abun inalienable genitive constructions, as in example 5.69.
Frequently the noun phrases are realised by only a pronoun and a noun, j uxtaposed in that
order, as seen in 5.70.
   5 .69     Ndar sye ne gwes de-dari            fat.
             dog big DEY leg           side-back broken
             Possessor(NP)    Possessum(NP)
             The big dog's back leg is broken .
   5.70      Ji  sy im fat.
             I so arm  broken
             My arm was broken.
78                                                                                    CHAPTER S
   A less common strategy discussed by Croft ( 1 990:32) is that of the use of a linker. He
says, ""The linker is invariant or contrasts only with simple juxtaposition, and functions
merely to link the possessor and head noun grammatical ly"". This is the second type of
genitive construction found in Abun. Abun alienable genitive constructions use this type of
strategy. The possessive marker bi is a linker. It links the possessor and the possessum, as
seen in examples 5.7 1 , 5 .72 and 5.73.
     5.71    Gap sye ne         bi    gan           ge w e kwop reo
             rat   big DEr poss young.one CL two die            PERF
             Possessor                Possessum
             The big rat's two young offspring had died.
     5.72    Ii ben ji      bi   nggwe.
             I SG do   I SG POSS garden
             I made my garden .
     5.73    Ii bi      pa     ge w e mu           mo    nu.
             I sG POSS child CL two go             LOC   house
             My two children went home.
   The noun phrase that represents the possessor undergoes no morphological change when
it is j uxtaposed or linked to the possessum. The possessum likewise is not marked
morphologically in any way. Even the linker, bi, can be shown to be a free form (and will be
in §5.3.2) and thus be considered separate from both the possess urn and the possessor. Abun
possessive phrases syntactically appear to be like coordinate noun phrases, one form
juxtaposed and the other using the linker bi as the coordinating particle, j ust as si is used to
conjoin noun phrases (see §5.7).
   Consistent with the absence of morphological marking in possessive phrases noted here,
Abun does not have a set of possessive pronouns, but uses the same set of pronouns as are
used in all other phrase types. I n contrast to this, in an early cursory analysis of Abun
(previously named Karon), Voorhoeve wrote (in Wurm 1 975:720) that possessive prefixes
had been noted with kinship terms: tabai ' my father' and nambai 'your father' , being cited
as examples. However in slow speech these two forms are: tat bi ai ' ISG POSS father: my
father' and nan bi ai'2SG POSS father: your father' (these phrases are in the Abun Tat dialect,
where tat is ' l sG ' ). No markings are made on either the head or the dependent in possessive
phrases. The same pronouns are employed in possessive phrases as in noun phrases that
occur in subject and object positions, that is, there is no special set of possessive pronouns
in Abun. In this way Abun differs from many other languages.
   The choice of which type of possessive construction to employ is determined by the
lexicon. The inalienable class of nouns which includes body parts, name, and analogously,
the parts of whole-part relationships such as trunk of tree and scales of fish (as discussed in
§3.3.2.3), is restricted and could be considered a closed set. All other nouns belong to an
open set of nouns and include names of places, objects, kinship terms, and advice. Many
languages with the alienable/inalienable distinction include kinship terms in the inalienable
category, but, in Abun, kinship terms are considered to be alienable.
  Now we tum to a more detailed discussion of each of the two types of genitive
constructions, inalienable (§5.3 . 1 ) and alienable (§5.3 .2).
PHRASE SIRUClVRE                                                                           795.3. 1 INALIENABLE POSSESSION
   Abun inalienable possessive phrases may be represented as:                                NP[POSSESSOR] NP[POSSESSUM]
where for pronominal reference the possessor may be replaced by i-, in the case of non­
human referents, or be elided in the case of body part referents.
   In inalienable possession, the possessor and the possessum are simply j uxtaposed as in
example 5.74. This type of possessive construction is used for body parts (such as my arm,
his leg) and more generally for whole-part relationships (such as tree-leaves, deer-meat,
house-opening (doorway)). Also a person' s name is considered as an inalienable possession,
as in 5.75 and 5.76.
   5 .74     Wo Kwai tik Sepenyel gwes.
             fish kwai pull Sepenyel leg
             The Kwai fish pulled Sepenyel's leg.
   5.75      An    gum do Marta.
             3so   name COM Marta
             Her name is Marta.
   5 .76     Marta gum sye do           Yekese.
             Marta name big COM Yekese
             Marta' s surname is Yekese.
   Whole-part relationships, in principle, follow the same structure as inalienable possessive
phrases, and could be analysed as separate words or as compounds. Here they are analysed
as compounds since the possessum is a bound root. It never stands on its own in normal
utterance. It is structurally bound to the preceding word, which represents the ' whole' . S o
rom ' liquid' in example 5 . 77 is bound to gur 'coconut' . No evidence has been found that
words like rom have ever been free forms.
   5.77      Ii     da    gur-rom.
             Iso drink coconut-liquid
             I drink coconut milk.
  The 'whole' may not j ust be a single word, but may also be a noun phrase, for example 'a
young coconut' , that compounds with the bound root, ' liquid' , as seen in example 5.78.
   5.78      da        [gur      bo   dekJ-rom         si     git i-ka       nde e. . .
             drink coconut CL         young-liquid     with eat its-flesh    NEG and
             don ' t drink young coconut milk and eat its flesh, and. . .
     There is one structural difference between inalienable possessive phrases and 'whole-part'
compounds. The difference is that the possessor in the phrase may be elided, whereas in the
compound it cannot. In the latter case, the possessor or 'whole' i s replaced with a prefix i-.
For example, a free form (or the 'whole' in whole-part relationships), such as kwe 'tree' in
example 5.79, can be replaced by the non-human possessive pronoun prefix, i-, as seen in
5 . 80. (See §3.3.2.4 for further discussion about the i- prefix.)
80                                                                                    CHAPTER S
     5.79        Ii     yo       kwe-muk e        kwe-guk.
                 I sG gather tree-trunk and tree-branch
                 I gathered up the trunks and branches.
     5 . 80      Ii     yo       i-muk      e    i-guk.
                 I sG gather its-trunk and its-branch
                 I gathered up the trunks and branches.
   However for body parts the possessum is an unbound form. The i- prefix is not used with
this type of construction when the possessor is elided. So when, say, an arm is referred to on
subsequent occasions, the free form of the posses sum is sufficient and ellipsis of the
possessor is acceptable, as seen in example 5. 8 1 .
     5.81        Men saram men syim . Men so ram syim rna                  nu.
                 IPL shake    I PL   hand I PL shake      hands we         house
                 We shook hands. We shook hands in the house.
     Both body parts and whole-part relationships can be combined as in examples 5 . 82 and
5 . 8 3 . In the latter case, the nails belong to the fingers, which belong to the arm (whole-part
relationships) and the arm belongs to him (body-part relationship).
     5.82        Prisila sap Moses syim-brot taka reo
                 Prisila cut Moses arm-vein apart PERF
                 Prisila had cut Moses' veins in his arm apart.
     5.83 a.     Yen gwat an syim-sopkwa-bris.
                 3PL cut      3sG arm-finger-nail
                 They cut his fingernails.
              b. Yen gwat an syim sopkwa             bris.
                 3PL cut      3sG arm      finger    nail
                 They cut his fingernails.
  An alternative analysis of whole-part relationship structures is shown in 5 . 83b above.
Each item here is treated as a separate word and, in this case, sapkwa bris is an inalienable
posessive phrase which is j uxtaposed to and modifies another inalienable possessive phrase,
an syim.","[89, 90, 91, 92]"

"   Perhaps in these cases the clause that fol lows rna gata does not represent an adverbial
clause of reason because no conjunction which indicates reason, such as we 'because' , has
been used. Rather, an additional clause has been joined to the sentence by means of the
locative preposition rna in exactly the same way that a locative phrase would be joined to the
clause. In Abun, with predicates such as sa 'laugh' and maskwa 'be angry ' , additional
arguments may be required in the clause to indicate not the object of these predicates, but
rather the reason behind the action. If this reason is expressed as a full clause, the clause is
embedded in the main clause by the dual means of the locative preposition rna and the
relative conjunction gata. 1 6
   I n these types of example we find that gata i s used i n clauses that could not be described
as restrictive relative clauses. Wherever sa gata and rna gata are used they appear to join
clauses rather than modify a head. In these cases the clauses that follow gata are full clauses.
There is no gap in these clauses because they are not relative clauses. It was discussed earlier
that gata was a relative conjunction rather than a relative marker (§9.3.3). It seems then that
in its function as a conjunction gata may join subordinate clauses to larger structures, even
though these are not relative clauses and are adverbial in meaning.
9.7 lNDEFlNITE RELATNE CLAUSES
   In the previous section clauses that departed from the standard relative clause type were
discussed. In this section another type of relative clause, the 'indefinite' relative clause, will
be shown to differ from the 'standard' restrictive relative clause. These types of clause, due to
the non-referential nature of the head, we have termed 'indefinite relative clauses' to
distinguish them from relative clauses of the regular variety. Structurally they differ from
regular relative clauses in that only the noun-modifying particle ta is used, rather than the
16    The concept of prepositions which behave as conjunctions will be developed further in Chapter 12.

                2. Whatever you find there, get rid of it.
    Huddleston terms the English equivalent of this type of construction a 'fused relative'
construction to distinguish it from other types of relative clause. In English, a non-specific
referent is marked by some type of wh phrase, by means of whoever, what or where
(Huddleston 1 984:403). Givon ( 1 990:646) also finds these types of relative problematic
since they do not line up with his semantic definition of a restrictive relative clause, namely
""A relative clause codes a proposition one of whose participants is coreferential with the
head noun that is modified by that clause"". If the head noun is non-referential there cannot be
strict referential identity, since many of these relative constructions concern hypothetical or
unknown situations.
   In Abun the fact that these are a different type of relative construction is grammatically
marked. Abun is a language in which it is important to mark the distinction between that
which is real and known and that which is hypothetical and unknown. Normally within the
noun phrase, if any information in a sentence is not given (that is already known), the
determiner yo 'indefinite, alan' is used in conj unction with the noun concerned. Therefore
Abun grammar marks the fact that nouns may refer to either actual or hypothetical entities.
When a noun represents the head of a relative clause, it is important in Abun to mark this
noun so that it can be interpreted as referring to some specific known referent or to some
hypothetical entity.
   It was explained earlier that the relative conjunction was composed of two morphemes,
the particles ga and to. In §9.3 . 1 , the role of the particle ga was explained as serving to
identify or mark the head of the relative clause as a specific referential identity. In the types of
construction, described as 'indefinite relative clauses' , the noun of the head has no real world
semantic referent at the time of utterance. There may be a range of possible referents but none
that is specific or known. Therefore this noun cannot be modified by gao The simple solution
in Abun is that these nouns are modified only by the general subordinating particle to. Since
ga is absent it is obvious that these nouns have no specific referent and are therefore
interpreted as non-referential. In English the same constructions need the addition of 'any' or
'ever' to make this clear, as examples 9.50 and 9.5 1 indicate.","[171, 172]"

10.4.4 KNOWLEDGE PREDICATES
   The predicate jam 'knowlhear/understand' also may be considered a Type 3 predicate in
that it may occur with or without a complementiser. However, this verb is structurally
different in that it does not have an object immediately preceding the complement clause
constituent, as is the case with the other Type 3 predicates. If jam has the meaning 'know ' it
is more likely to use the complementiser in conjunction with the complement clause. If jam29     In particular predicates such as 'know' , 'lie' and 'call' which Giv6n terms 'Perception-Cognition­
       Utterance' predicates 'no co-reference with any argument in the main clause' is required in English
       (Giv6n 1 993: 1 6).
COMPLEMENT CUUSES                                                                                       1 89has the meaning 'hear' it appears not to use the complementiser. The following examples
illustrate these possibilities:
   10.81     Ji    jam k w e       mbrur kwe-nat        kra            kagit as        ma   it.
             l sG hear wood snap tree-leaves crackle from path DIR CAM
             I heard wood snapping and leaves crackling coming from the path.
   10.82     An    jam     an      baca   kuru! dik         kuru! dik.
             3sG know 3sG read         letter one letter               one
             She knew (how) to read one letter at a time.
   10.83     Ji    jam     do      sangge nau               re        dam suk- ibit.
             l sG know COM true              palm.wine this also NOM-bad
             I know that it is true, this palm wine is also a bad thing.
   The following example is interesting in that it contains both types of complement clause
within the one sentence. There is an embedded complement clause which i s the object of the
predicate jam 'hear' . This embedded clause contains yet another complement which, in this
case, consists of the complementiser in conjunction with a complement clause.
   1 0. 84   Ji    jam an         ke      it     do     ""yesyim yesyim nan kas                    kekro "".
             l SG hear 3sG call.out CAM COM friend             friend             2SG   run       quickly
             I heard him calling out, ""Friend! Friend! Run quickly ! ""
10.5 MORE ON MANIPULATIVE PREDICATES
   Earlier in § 1 O.3 manipulative predicates which made use of the suffix -gat were
discussed. These predicates did not make use of the complementiser and the complements
were analysed as embedded objects. However, the manipulative verb ben 'do/make' was not
discussed because it is considered to be a predicate or a different type. Frequently ben has the
meaning of 'do' and so cannot be considered manipulative. B ut when ben has the meaning
of 'make' it can be used as a manipulative predicate. With this verb, as with other
manipulative predicates, the complementiser i s never used. The following examples are
typical:
   1 0.85    Nan m e      su-ga        ben      an     bi        pa       i    ne.
             2sG see thing-REL make 3sG ross child                        sick DEI'
             You see the thing that has made (his) child sick.
   10.86     An    ben     motor ne       kru    reo
             3sG make motor that          sink PERF
             He made that motor sink.
    These complements have a similar structure to those that were termed predicate Type 2. In
keeping with the structural analysis discussed earlier, here also the entire complement clause
is considered to be the object of the main clause.
   Since examples from all of the predicate types have been discussed fully, this concludes
the discussion of Abun complement clauses.
                                           CHAPTER 1 1
                                  ADVERBIAL CLAUSES1 1 . 1 lNTRODUCfION
   Various terms are used to describe how, within a single sentence, clauses interact to form
a meaningful unit. Terms such as 'interclausal coherence' (Givon 1 990), 'relationships
within the clause complex' (Halliday 1 985) and even 'clause combining' (Matthiessen &
Thompson 1 988) are among recent descriptions of what has been traditionally termed
subordination. Traditionally, as Thompson and Longacre ( 1 985: 1 72) state, three types of
subordinate clause have been distinguished:
      those which function as noun phrases (called complements) [=noun clauses],
      those which function as modifiers of nouns (relative clauses), and those which
      function as modifiers of verb phrases or entire propositions (called adverbial
      clauses).
Relative clauses and noun clauses have been described in the earlier Chapters 9 and 10. In
this chapter we will begin a discussion of the third kind of subordinate clause, ' adverbial
clauses' , as they are found in Abun.
   Adverbial subordinate clauses are said to modify a sentence in the same way that an
adverb modifies a verb. Since the sentences that contain these subordinate clauses consist
minimally of two clauses, one clause could be termed the Head and the other the Modifier
(Halliday 1 985 : 1 92). Usually one clause, often termed the main clause, is said to be
grammatically 'free' or independent. As such it can stand on its own as a single clause. The
subordinate clause is marked in some way, such as by means of verbal inflection, to indicate
that it is 'bound' or dependent and thus cannot stand alone as a single clause. Languages that
permit clauses to be joined in this way normally permit an alternative, termed coordination.
In these cases the clauses, although joined together in some way, may stand on their own as
independent clauses. However, there is another quite different type of ""interclausal
grammatical organization"" (to use Givon ' s terminology 1 990: 864). This type is known as
'clause chaining' (Longacre 1985). Longacre states that languages of the clause-chaining
variety do not offer the grammatical options of subordinate-independent and coordinate
constructions. ''The subordinate/coordi nate distinction is irrelevant [in that there is no choice
between the two] and both are absorbed into the medial/final distinction."" (Longacre
1 985:239). To demonstrate this Longacre gives two English sentences which illustrate the
subordinatelcoordinate options of a language such as English. These sentences, given below
as I L I a and 1 1 . 1 b, would not be syntactically distinct in a language of the clause-chaining
type.
   1 1 . 1 a. After chopping the wood, John carried it to his house.","[200, 201, 202]"

10.2.3.2 COMPLEMENT-TAKING NOUNS: THOUGHTS
   Thoughts and plans may also take complements. The conceptual thought or plan may be
expressed by means of a noun phrase, having the structure of a possessive phrase. The
complements described here differ from naming complements in that the complement in
these cases always consists of a ful l clause, not j ust a single noun phrase.
   1 0.35   An wa bi        suk-jimnot i      do an wa kra         Andar kagit Lamber.
            3 sG FOC POSS NOM-think own COM 3SG FOC marry Andar from Lamber
            His particular plan (was) that he would marry Andar rather than Lamber.
    Occasionally the stative particle/verb may follow the possessive phrase as in example
1 0.36 below; however, it is more usual for this to be omitted. Sukjimnot 'thought, plan,
intention' appears to be the only Abun noun which may take complements in this way.

    When a subordinate clause is a complement, it is common for the complement to function
as the subject or object of the larger clause into which it is embedded. In Abun , complements
may function as objects of a clause and this type of complement will be described under
§ 1 O.3. However, the type of subordinate clause that has been under discussion here, those
that are identified by the complementiser do, do not function in this way.
   At this stage it may be relevant to restate the criteria that determines which constituent i s
the object i n a n Abun clause. A s stated i n §4. 1 , ""The direct object in a n Abun transitive
clause is also encoded by word order alone. Abun objects are always the constituent realised
by a noun phrase that immediately follows the verb . . . "" Since there is no case marking on
nouns, this cannot be used to identify the object. The rigid word order of the Abun language
does not allow passivisation and so this cannot serve to identify the object either. Unlike the
dative relation the object is not identified by a particular preposition. The object i s
distinguished from the subject o n the sole criteria o f word order.
   When the complementiser is used, the constituent that follows the complementiser does
not function as the direct object of the main clause. Three arguments are put forward here to
support this analysis:
   (1)     A do-clause can follow an intransitive verb.
   (2)     When the verb is transitive a do-clause can co-occur with the direct object.
   (3)     Abun word order indicates that a do-clause functions as an oblique.
   These arguments wi I I now be expanded further.","[183, 184]"
"    Comrie's definition, given earlier, (Comrie 1 989: 1 43) that a relative clause consists
minimally of a head and a restricting clause does not seem to leave room for a relative
conjunction as a unit in its own right within the relative clause. Under Comrie ' s definition, it
is necessary to place such items as relative pronouns or relative markers within the restricting
clause. For instance relative pronouns are considered clause-initial. However, since gato is
not a relative pronoun it cannot be considered as part of the restricting clause. Regarding the
particle ga this is always a part of a noun phrase. For example, it is possible to say Yohana ga
'Yohana who I just mentioned' or an ga 'he, the one I just mentioned' , as described in §9.3 . 1
above. B ut this i s not the case for the particle to. I t i s not possible to say Yohana to, for this
has no meaning. Because the grammatical function of to is to identify a subordinate structure
of some kind, it cannot stand as part of a noun phrase, but rather it is the initial component of
the subordinate structure.
   The two morphemes of gata thus enable it to behave as a conjunction or linker. The first
morpheme, ga, could be said to be actually part of the noun phrase head of the relative clause.
The second morpheme to is the initial component of the restricting clause. The combined
form, gato, therefore behaves like a bridge or linker between both head and restricting clause,
giving rise to the description stated earlier in §9. 1 .
                                 HEAD + CONJUNCTION gato + RESTRICfING CLAUSE
                                                           -
  This structure is similar to English relative constructions when two elements such as 'that
which' in 'He knows that which he wants' merge to the single element 'what' in 'He knows
what he wants' .
   There are also other reasons for considering gato a relative conjunction and not simply
some sort of relative particle. Although the particle ga serves to identify the head, there are
subordinating conjunctions in Abun that are likewise part of the clause that precedes them
(see § 1 1 .2). They may not be removed from it. Although these subordinating conjunctions
are considered part of the initial clause and are clause-final, a secondary clause follows them
RELATNE CLAUSES                                                                                      151because they are subordinating conj unctions. They can never be sentence-final i n the same
way that to may never be sentence-final (or for that matter phrase- or clause-final ) . ! 0   Thus the relative conjunction gato is an integral part of both head and clause and cannot be
separated from either. The fact that the conjunction behaves additionally as a linker between
the two parts is not unusual in Abun grammar. ! ! Later, in §9.6, gato is shown to behave as a
conjunction joining two clauses, not a noun head and another clause as is the case with
relative clauses. This is another reason for considering gato a conj unction rather than simply
a relati ve particle. ! 29.4 THE COMPONFNfS OF11IE RFSrRICTING CLAUSE
  Besides consisting of a full clause, the restricting clause may consist of a single word.
This single word may be an adjective as in example 9 . 1 7 , or an adverb as in 9. 1 8.","[162, 163]"
"   Therefore, Abun is an isolating language, mostly monosyllabic. In the few cases of
affixation and word compounding that do occur, the morphemes are easily segmentable.
   The implications of very little affixation in Abun are that other strategies are required to
effect what is normally achieved through affixation. For example, in many languages
affixation on the head of a noun phrase defines grammatical relations. However, in Abun,
word order alone defines core grammatical relations, while prepositions are used with
obliques. Number is expressed with a classifier and a number word, rather than an affix.
Possession is not marked with an affix, but instead a linker is used between the possessor
and the possessum.
   Very little affixation occurs on Abun verbs. Instead of person/number agreement affixes
on verbs, only free form pronouns are used. While other languages in the West Papuan
Phylum have both free pronorrunal forms and person/number prefixes on verbs, including
the most closely related language, Maibrat, Abun does not. Time adverbs, temporal
prepositional phrases and some conjunctions indicate notions of time normally carried by
tense affixes. Polarity, aspect, mood and modality are conveyed by the use of particles, not
by affixation on verbs as is common in Papuan languages (Foley 1 986).
  The processes of word-building in Abun are therefore rather lirruted. The following
processes are evident: lirruted suffixation on verbs (§3 . 3 . 1 ) ; three prefixes for nouns (§3.3.2);
word compounding, principally in nouns (§3.3 .2); and some adjectives are used as manner
adverbs (§3.3.3 and §3.3 .4).",[36]

1.5 THE GENERAL LINGUISTIC SITUATION
1.5.1 CLASSlFICATION OF THE AEUN LANGUAGE
   The Abun language is classified as a Papuan language by Wurm (1982:206). It belongs to
the small West Papuan Phylum. It is part of the Bird' s Head Superstock, the Central Bird's
Head Stock, and more specifically the North Bird' s Head Family, of which Abun and Madik
are listed as members. While Wurm listed Abun and Madik as separate languages, Berry and
Berry (1987) have presented further information regarding lexical similarities and structural
similarities which indicate that Abun and Madik are dialects of the same language. Therefore,
Abun is a farillly-Ievel isolate in the Central Bird's Head Stock.
4                                                                                    CHAPTER 11.5.2 PAPUAN VERSUS AUS1RONESIAN FFATURfS OFTIIE AEUN LANGUAGE
   Wurm's classification of Abun as a Papuan language seems to be based mainly on its
lexical inventory, with special reference to its set of personal pronouns. There are a
considerable number of Austronesian loan words in the West Papuan (WP) Phylum
languages, and when only non-Austronesian lexical items are compared, the lexical
interrelationship between the WPP languages is much closer. WPP languages in the Bird's
Head contain a small Trans New Guinea (TNG) Phylum lexical element, some of which
may be due to borrowing from the South Bird's Head Stock (which is part of the TNG
Phylum), or may be traces of an old TNG Phylum substratum (Wurm 1 982:204). The
personal pronouns are clearly Papuan, belonging to Wurm's set III (Wurm 1 982:40). Abun
personal pronouns do not distinguish between first person plural inclusive and exclusive,
whereas this is universal for Austronesian languages. Neither are there bound subject
markers on the verb, which is a feature of Austronesian languages. Thus Abun' s pronouns
are more akin to Papuan languages than to Austronesian languages.
   Other Papuan (or perhaps non-Austronesian) features include: no bound subject markers
on the verb, phonologically relevant tone and an irrealis-realis (or non-pasUpast) distinction
which is marked only on complex sentences. Perhaps the most striking Papuan features of
Abun syntax are found at the level of the complex sentence. In some Abun complex
sentences there is no clear syntactic marking to distinguish those clauses which could be
considered subordinate from those which might be termed coordinate. This lack of
subordinate/coordinate distinction is found in Papuan clause-chaining languages. Likewise, in
Papuan clause-chaining languages the semantic notions of temporal sequence and
simultaneity are strongly marked (Longacre 1985:264). These notions also feature strongly in
Abun complex sentences.
   However, Abun has a number of Austronesian features. Most notable is the rigid word
order of svo as distinct from the Papuan SOY word order (Wurm 1 982:64). Other significant
Austronesian features include: a very simple derivational morphology; uncomplicated and
very little inflectional affixation; the common use of particles where verb affixation would be
used in Papuan languages; the use of prepositions instead of postpositions or case marking;
no special sentence-medial verbs; a decimal numbering system unlike the normal Papuan
binary, trinary or quinary systems (Wurm 1 982:64); the existence of reduplicated adverbs;
simple morphophonemic changes and the common use of labialised consonants.
    Despite these features which could make it appear that grammatically Abun has more in
common with Austronesian languages, Abun has some unique features which distinguish it
from both Papuan and Austronesian languages. The use of particles in Abun is so extensive
that it is far greater than in Austronesian languages such as Indonesian. Particles are the main
means of grammatical communication, with affixation playing an extremely minor role. Due
to the lack of affixation in Abun syntax, other grammatical strategies have been developed. In
particular, the use of bracketing (whereby two particles act as boundary markers for a
particular grammatical constituent) serves to identify some important grammatical features,
namely negation, interrogatives and relative clauses. Therefore, Abun does not neatly fit into
either of the neighbouring language classifications, that is Austronesian or Papuan, but shares
features of both.
INTRODUcnON                                                                                51.5.3 THE INFLUENCE OF SURROUNDING lANGUAGES ON ABUN
   The influence of surrounding languages on Abun has been significant. It is particularly
easy to see the influence of Biak and Indonesian, as will be demonstrated below, but less so
the influence of the three neighbouring languages of Moi, Mpur and Mai Brat (Mare). This is
no doubt because the contact with Biak and Indonesian has been closer and more continuous.
   There are two tribal groups which have migrated to the region where Abun is spoken, the
As and the Biak people. The As language group, who migrated from Gag island before the
turn of the century, came to live in the subdistrict of Mega where the Abun Ji dialect is
spoken. The Biak people, who fled from the island of Biak, came into the Sausapor area in
the early 1 900s and have had a significant influence on the language of the Abun people. The
Biak people brought the Christian message to the Abun people and in doing so used many of
their own words and phrases. Words such as rur 'spirit', nadi 'pray' , sam 'worship' were
introduced from the Biak language. The word for 'God' , Yefun, has come from the Biakfun
'respected person' combined with the Abun personaliser prefix ye- 'person'. Also many
words for fish and terms related to the sea and seaside have been assimilated from the Biak
language.
   The Abun-speaking people have had contact not only with the Biak people. Trade in kain
timur '(antique) eastern cloth' with neighbouring language groups has had an influence on
Abun. Kain timur is one of the Abun-speaking people's main tokens of wealth and is used
for paying bride price as well as fines. It originates from East Timor.
   Most villagers stay close to their own village and do not travel far. Even so, the
Indonesian language has found its way to some extent even to the remotest Abun village.
Many Indonesian words also accompanied the introduction of Christianity and government
systems, and have become part of Abun vocabulary. Indonesian words such as selamat
'save' , ampuni 'forgive', perintah 'command, rule', desa 'village' and berkat 'bless' have
been introduced, although Abun speakers seldom understand the meaning of some of these
Indonesian terms.
   Several Indonesian and Biak verbs have been included in common use in Abun even
though in many cases there is an Abun lexical item for the same idea. A bi- prefix, probably
borrowed from the Biak language, is attached to verbs that are introduced from other
languages. All borrowed verbs are verbalised with what could be named, the foreign verb
verbaliser (FVV) prefix. Example 1 . 1 shows the borrowing of the Indonesian word mengerti
'understand'; example 1 .2 uses the Biak word win 'sail' .
   1. 1      I sak   bi-mengerti        suk        gata   nan   ki    ne.
             Isak FYV-understand thing which              2sG   say   DEf
             Isak understands what you are saying.
   1.2       Men bi-win         mu     ma     ef
             1 PL FYV-sail        go    LOC   island
             Let' s sail to the island.
   Abun-speaking people have borrowed words to handle new concepts such as sailing. In
example 1.2 the word is borrowed from Biak. The Abun people traditionally lived on and
around the Tambrau ranges and so did not have cause to sail anywhere. Other verbs that have
been introduced from Indonesian are tutup 'close', buka 'open' for closing and opening
6                                                                                    CHAPTER 1doors. Doors are also a new thing for the Abun. In the past they just had a nu-syo 'house
opening; doorway' (lit. house-mouth) with no door as such.
   Often the words borrowed by the Abun speaker do not retain the original pronunciation.
Abun does not have a separate velar nasal phoneme. The velar nasal occurs only medially
preceding a voiced velar plosive. So when words are borrowed such as bunga 'flower', the
ng (which represents a velar nasal) is pronounced as a prenasalised plosive by Abun
speakers. When a velar nasal is word-final in borrowed words such as kosong 'nil, empty,
zero', it is pronounced as an alveolar nasal, (koson).
   Words borrowed from other languages are also changed in pronunciation, not just
according to Abun phonology, but also because the first ones who heard the words that were
borrowed did not recall and repeat the words accurately. For example, the Biak word Jarkor
'study' was somehow changed to Jaskor by the speakers of Abun Ji dialect whereas Abun
Ye dialect speakers do not make any change.
   Indonesian conjunctions have also found their way into the Abun language. The main
conjunctions adopted from Indonesian are kalau 'if, when' , sebelum 'before', baru 'then (in
colloquial use)',jadi 'so, therefore' . Indonesian conjunctions are frequently used in addition
to Abun conjunctions because the placement of Abun conjunctions in the sentence often
differs from the Indonesian placement. In Indonesian the word sebelum 'before' is sentence­
initial, whereas in Abun the expression nde t6 'before' occurs at the end of the first clause as
in example 1 .3 below.
    1 .3        Men yo       mu    nde to,         men git su-git.
                1 PL NEG   go      NEG      INCAM 1 PL   eat NOM-eat
                Before we go let's eat.
   The Abun speaker who borrows the Indonesian sebelum 'before' , also keeps his own
language' s expression for the same idea. So the use of the more redundant form as in
example 1.4 is common.
    1.4         Sebelum men        yo       mu    nde    to,   men git su-git.
                before    1PL       NEG     go    NEG    INCAM 1 PL eat NOM-eat
                Before we go let' s eat.
    This is not just limited to conjunctions but also to other items such as the Indonesian
 prohibitionjangan 'do not' . In Abun, negation requires that yo and nde bracket the predicate
as in example 1 .3. In the prohibitive form the yo is omitted. Example 1.5a is the traditional
 way of saying 'Don't cry!' , but Abun speakers who have been influenced by Indonesian add
jangan, as in 1 .5b. However, example 1.5c is unacceptable.
    1 .5 a.     Nan w o nde.
                2sG cry NEG
                Don' t cry!
           b.   Jangall nan       wo       nde.
                do.not  2sG       cry      NEG
                Don't cry!
           c.   *Jangan nan woo
                do.not     2sG cry
                Don't cry!
INTRODUCTION                                                                                   7    Abun speakers have borrowed some Indonesian words to make meanings more specific.
The Abun word jam has the meaning of both 'to know' and 'to understand' , as in examples
1 .6 and 1 .7. They have equated jam with the Indonesian word tahu 'to know', but have
borrowed the Indonesian mengerti 'to understand' in many cases to differentiate the two
concepts, as in example 1 .7b.
   l .6        Ii jam      an gum.
               ISG know 3sG name
               I know his name.
   l .7 a.     Ii jam            nan hi       suk-du.
               I sG understand 2SG POSS NOM-Speak
               I understand what you are saying.

               ISG FVV-understand 2sG         POSS    NOM-speak
               I understand what you are saying.
   Some borrowed words undergo a shift in meaning from the original meaning in the
source language. For example, even though the Abun have a way to express intensification,
they have borrowed an Indonesian word, jadi 'to happen, become' and mixed this with nde
'not' to make jadi nde ' INTENSIFIER' . They actually have many ways of expressing
intensification (see §5 .5), but they have borrowed this, even though the actual use of the
Indonesian is not standard. The meaning of jadi nde according to its components is 'did not
happen' . B ut the meaning given to it is 'happened very much ' , as in example l . 8.
   1.8         A n w o jadi          nde.
               3sG cry happen        NEG

ADVERBIAL CLA USES                                                                                     191            b. John chopped the wood and carried it to his house. 3D
   Example I L I a above consists of a subordinate temporal clause and an independent
clause. The first clause is marked as subordinate in English by means of the participial verb
form, the use of the conjunction 'after' and the absence of the subject. Example 1 1 . 1 b i s
given a s an example o f a 'coordinate construction' (Longacre 1 985:239). Longacre's
comment on these sentences, quoted above, is to the effect that a clause-chaining language
does not permit two different syntactic variants, as is possible in English. Only one i s
possible. Abun is not a clause-chaining language. However, the influence o f Papuan clause­
chaining languages can be seen when Longacre's examples are translated into Abun. The
translations are given below as 1 1 .2a and 1 1 .2b respectively. There is little syntactic
difference between these two examples.
     1 1 .2 a.   Yohanes pet     kwe-gu      or-ete       an     gwat rnu rna an          hi     nu.
                 John     split tree-dry after-then 3sG carry OlR to               3sG    poss house
                 After John chopped the wood he carried it to his house.
            b.   Yohanes pet      kwe-gu      ete         an     gwat rnu rna an          hi   nu.
                 John      split tree-dry and.then 3sG bring OlR to 3sG                   POSS house
                 John chopped the fire wood and then carried it to his house.
   It can be seen by comparing these Abun sentences that there is no distinct subordinate
marking on the verb of the first clause in example 1 1 .2a, which might distinguish this clause
as a subordinate clause; neither is there a subordinate conj unction equivalent to 'after' . Abun
or 'after' is an adverb which, in 1 1 .2a, compounds with the sequential conjunction ete 'and
then ' . Abun does not have an exact meaning equivalent for the English coordinate
conj unction ' and' . In fact the only difference between these two examples regarding
constituent structure is the addition of or 'after' to the conjunction ete in example 1 1 .2a. If
the conj unctions orete and ete were removed from these examples, all four remaining
clauses would be good, freestanding independent clauses in Abun.
   Therefore it appears that in common with languages of the clause-chaining type, Abun
lacks an obvious subordinate/coordinate distinction as found in Indo-European languages.
Many of the clause-chaining languages of the world are found on the island of New Guinea.
In a clause-chaining language (Longacre 1985:264)
       There is a clause (characteristically final in a chain of clauses) that has a verb of
       distinctive structure that occurs but once in the entire chain while other (typically
       non-final) clauses have verbs of different structure . . .Each non-final clause is
       marked so as to indicate whether the fol lowing clause has same subject or
       different subject from itself.
   An example from a clause-chaining language, Kanite of Papua New Guinea, is given
below. Because of its length, it has been abbreviated from the original example given in
Longacre ( 1 985 :266).
                 (1)   his-u 'a-ke- 'ka
                       do-we-os-you
3D    It could be argued that strictly speaking the second clause of Longacre' s example here cannot
      stand on its own because the pronoun has been omitted. In the Abun translation given later, this i s
      certainly not the case a s it i s necessary t o repeat the pronoun.

     In this example, abbreviated from eight clauses to the four given here, a transition marker,
ke 'os different subject', indicates a change of subject in the clause which i s to follow. The
final verb of this sentence nehis- has a distinctive form that i s different from when it is non­
final , as in the initial clause where it occurs as his-.
   These languages usually mark, within the clause chain, the notions of temporal overlap (or
simultaneity) and temporal succession (or sequence) as well as marking change of subject
(switch reference) (Longacre 1985 :267). Abun, a West Papuan language, does not have the
verb morphology typical of a clause-chaining language. Nevertheless the notions of
simultaneity and sequence are strongly marked on Abun complex sentences) l These
features of the neighbouring Papuan languages have had some influence on Abun sentence
structure. It is the author's opinion that just as clause-chaining languages do not have a clear­
cut subordinate/coordinate distinction which is syntactically marked in complex sentences,
neither does the Abun language. This also is a Papuan areal feature still evident in Abun,
even though Abun verb morphology has more in common with Austronesian languages.
Therefore the adverbial clauses discussed in this and the following chapter can only be
considered as 'adverbial' subordinate clauses by semantic means; there is scarce syntactic
marking to indicate subordinate status.
   Traditionally, a discussion of the 'adverbial ' subordinate clauses of a language would
subdivide clauses on the basis of the semantic relationships expressed between the clauses
such as time, location, reason, condition. In this discussion we prefer to group clause types
according to common syntactic properties, as well as considering semantic similarities. In
this and the following chapter adverbial clauses are not grouped together as subordinate
clauses which contrast syntactically with coordinate clauses. Rather, these clauses are
differentiated according to the type of conjunction that is used to link them. In Abun,
conjunctions divide into three main types-postpositional, prepositional and compounding.","[202, 203, 204]"

6   Lyons ( 1 968 :3 1 7) noted that in some languages these concepts may merge into one another. In
    attempting to define the precise meaning of the predicate markers they can be loosely described a s
    falling into this broad area.

3.4.4 PROFORMS
   Abun has three subclasses of proforms                including      pronouns,      prosentences,     and
interrogative proforms.
    There is only one set of pronouns in Abun which is used for subject, object and possessor
and is listed in Table 3 . 1 4 below. There is significant dialectal variation, with the three main
dialects being distinguished by their first person singular pronoun. In addition to dual forms
trial and greater are possible. Thus me-ka-gri ' we three' or an-ka-at 'they four' are
frequently used in story telling.

                  non-human         i-
   In addition to the above pronouns, Abun has a reciprocal pronoun, yu, and two reflexive
forms, dakai and wadigan. These modify the appropriate pronoun above and yu. For further
details regarding the distinction between these two see §5.2. 1 . The same form of this
pronoun is used for all persons.
   The Abun prosentence subclass consists of one member, which i s also the pri mary
negation particle, nde. This word is used to answer questions with a 'no' and, as such, is
equivalent to a negative sentence. Affirmative answers use an echo system rather than a
prosentence (see §6. 1 for more details).
   There are three members of the interrogative proforms subclass, namely u 'which ' ,
suma 'what' and o t 'how many ' . These forms combine with other words to create
interrogative expressions such as, mo u 'ux: which: where' and kam ot 'day how .many:
when' . For more detail s see §6. 1 .4.","[55, 56, 57]"

10.3.2 EMBFDDFD COMPLEMENT CLAUSE AS OBJECr   Having shown that these complement clauses are subordinate, even though they possess
no overt grammatical marking to indicate this status, the second claim is that these embedded
clauses function as the object of the complement-taking predicate. In one sense this might
seem obvious since a complement clause is by definition a notional object of some predicate;
in the structures under discussion here it is hard to see how it might function as anything
else. Nevertheless there could be differences of opinion over the types of constituent
divisions being made for these sentences. Two examples will be shown again being
representative of the two different predicate types.
     1 0 .65    Men yo         wergat     ye-wis        yi       ben-bot     suk     re     nde.
                I PL NEG force         PERs-kind other do-about thing                this   NEG
                We do not force other tribes to do these things.
     1 0.66     Men yo      nyu-wa men          mu ki.       suk-du          re     nde.
                I PL NEG fear-TRS I PL          go     say NOM-say           this   NEG
                We are not afraid to go and tell this story.
   For these two examples, given originally as 10.53 and 10.58 respectively, the entire
complement clause (underlined) is considered to be the object of the complement-taking
predicates. Thus the object of wergat 'force' in 1 0.65 is yewis yi ben suk re 'other tribes do
these things' and in 1 0.66 the object of the verb nyuwa 'be afraid of' is men mu ki sukdu re
'we go and tell this story' . This analysis is in keeping with the type of constituent division
found in traditional transformational grammar and similar to that found in the more recent
version of this theory known as 'Government and Binding' .2 6
    However, it could be posited that the entire embedded clause is not the object of the
complement-taking verbs but rather a single noun phrase only, namely yewis yi 'other
tribes' in example 1 0.65 and men 'we' in 1 0.66. This type of constituent division poses a
few problems. Because Abun has no case marking to put a noun like men into the
accusative, it cannot be seen whether this noun has been marked to show it is in the object
26     See, for example, the tree diagrams for sentences where the main clause verb is 'wish' in Jacobsen
       ( 1 986:40, 1 1 3, 1 1 8). The diagrams on pp. 1 1 3 and 1 1 8 show the tree structure in the light of
       'principles of Government and B inding' and so is a more recent analysis. The entire clause i s
       handled a s a single constituent S under a higher V P node.
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                            1 83relation. In fact there is no marking anywhere in the structure to show what is the object or
where various constituent divisions can be made. The evidence previously given attempts to
establish that these clauses function as a single unit. If this is not the case then what follows
these verbs must be two divisions: one for the noun phrase which will function as the object
and a second division for what is left, a truncated subjectless clause. This is the type of
division that is made in Relational Grammar, where only part of the embedded clause
assumes the function of direct object and the rest takes the relation of chOmeur 'unemployed'
(Blake: I 990:93ff.). It is a 'raising analysis' where a constituent that belongs logically to the
complement clause is said to be raised to the object of the matrix clause.
  This is a possible analysis since Abun clauses are unmarked to show any type of
constituent marking. However, on structural grounds, this analysis is not preferred.
   Firstly, with both predicate types involved, the entire clause which functions as the object
can be replaced by a single noun phrase which can operate as the object. For example:   1 0.67    An ki     do      an     kra    su     ji   sare-wo         ji
             3so say COM 3so          marry with I so    like. this-but I so             bari-wa          an     reo
             not.want-TRS 3so PERF
             She said that she would marry me but I did not want her.
   1 0.68    Kapre       an        bari-wa        Rahel bi    ai      wergat         an.
             although 3so not.want-TRS Rahel poss father persuade 3so
             Although she did not want (to come) Rahel's father persuaded her.","[194, 195]"

   Examples 1 2.58 and 1 2.59 below are from speakers who have been educated in
Indonesian. In these examples sane is a sentence-initial conj unction.
   1 2.58    Sane men      ben  kwat     pe           sa,           men siker
             so   I PL     make platform secure       when.REAL     1 PL tease

             So when we had secured (the pig) to the platform, we teased it about all kinds
             of things.
   1 2.59    Sane men sam kwem mu ti                        kwop karowa sem nap.
             so    1 PL    carry canoe    DIR seaward leave near               sea waves
             So we carried the canoe towards the sea (and) left it near the water' s edge.
   Unlike with kapre the influence of Indonesian is not so strong as to totally change sane
from a sentence-medial to sentence-initial conjunction. Nevertheless it can be seen that sane
does not behave like other prepositional conjunctions.
   The conj unction sane has several variants all of which illustrate that the influence of the
Indonesian language is still only partial. Sane, in common with the compounding
conj unctions, also has the ability to compound with other conjunctions, creating new forms.
Sane-yo and sane-gelte are two variants which could both be translated as 'so then' or
'therefore' . Just as the distinction between yo and sa was primarily one of tense or time
setting, this distinction is carried over to the conjunction sane by means of the compound
forms. Thus sane-ge is 'therefore-REAL' and sane-yo 'therefore-IRR'.
(iii) sane-ge 'therefore-REAL'
   The compound sane-ge uses the conjunction ge 'then' to indicate realis or past time rather
than the subordinating conjunction sa. There are dialect variants sane-te and sane-gede.
Sane-ge differs from sane-yo only in the sense that sane-ge links two c lauses that express
events that have already occurred or are already past.

   1 2.62    Be    yerom     ki    do,    ana s i        nje    gu      an    bi
             later yerom     say   COM    FOC with       people kill    3sG   poss

             male.relative yerom this and therefore-REAL 3SG go PERF
             Later the yerom spirit would say that (the shaman) was the one who together
             with others killed his relative this (other) yerom, so the shaman went away (to
             avoid suspicion).
    In the above example the first clause represents not an actual event but only a possibility.
However this possibility, what the yerom spirit might say, occurred in the past according to
the time setting of the narrative from which this sentence was taken. The last clause of the
sentence is marked with the perfect aspect reo By this it is known that the events described
have already taken place. Therefore these clauses are linked by sane-ge rather than sane-yo
to indicate a past time setting.
(iv) sane-yo 'therefore-IRR'
    When the temporal conj unction yo is joined to sane, creating sane-yo, then the various
ranges of meaning attributable to yo can be added as well. In Chapter 1 1 it was stated that yo
is used to indicate future events or plans. It can also be used to describe hypothetical events
and procedural, hypothetical events. Sane-yo is also used to link clauses of this nature.
Examples 1 2.63 and 1 2.64 describe future intent and non-past time respectively.
   1 2.63    Set bi   ai     mo       ket     tu        re   sane-yo
             Set POss father at       west    distant   PERF therefore-IRR

             therefore.IRR NEG come.out NEG
             Your female relative is sick every day therefore she does not come out.
   Example 1 2.65 below describes a hypothetical situation. Hence sane-yo rather than sane­
ge is used.
   1 2.65    Sa to       pa        ne          bi   yenggras      ben suk
             for.example young.man DEI         POss elders        do  thing

             For example if the young man' s elders do something wrong then they will beat
             the young man.
  The following examples express events that are considered likely to happen, best
expressed in English by 'whenever' . Here again sane-yo is the conjunction used.

             2. When a woman gives birth, if this is the case then (other) women must not
                touch her.
(v) sane-sa ' had that been the case'
   These two variants of the conjunction sane, described above, overtly mark the time setting
of the complex sentence by means of the additions of ge or yo. Normally the conjunction ge
does not indicate time setting but rather indicates temporal sequence. It i s used in this way
because when the conjunction sa combines with sane the meaning of the compound form i s
not that o f time setting. Sa has been described a s a realis conjunction. This definition has
been taken to mean primarily that sa can be used to indicate events occurring in the past. If
events are marked for past time setting this is an indicator that these events are factual. In
Abun the conjunction sa has a secondary usage that is derived from this 'factual' component
of its meaning. This secondary usage can best be described as 'subj unctive ' . The following
examples illustrate this secondary usage which is evident in the compound form sane-sa.
   1 2.68   A      napawa   amam hi    suk-du    kamekre,
            2so    remember daddy POSS NOM-Speak yesterday
            sanesa                  kwis   yo gu       a    nde.
            had.that.been.the.case snake NEG bite 2so NEG
            1 . Had you remembered what Daddy said to you yesterday, the snake wouldn't
               have bitten you.
            2. If you had remembered what Daddy said to you yesterday, the snake would
               not have bitten you.
   The context for example 1 2.68 above is that a father has warned his son not to play in
long grass, because often snakes are found there. The son ignores the warning and is bitten
by the snake. The semantic thrust of sane-sa is to indicate that had the events of clause one
been factual then the events of clause two would not have happened. Example 1 2.69 is

demonstrate a perfective/imperfective contrast. Sane-sa has the meaning 'had that been the
case ' , which is perfective or realis. On the other hand sane-yo can mean 'that being the case'
which is imperfective or irrealis. Example 1 2.70 below shows sane-yo used in this way.
     1 2.70    Men i,           sane-yo               men mu nai pel mo mantri.

               2. Whenever we are sick, we go and get pills from the health worker.
     The last variant of sane is sane analo. This will be discussed in the following section.
1 2.6 analo 'CAUSATIVE' CONJUNCfION
    In the previous section two conjunctions were described which primarily filled another
category in Abun grammar besides that of 'conjunction ' . Kap-re is a temporal phrase
meaning 'this time ' . Sane is an adverbial meaning ' like that' or 'in that way ' . For both these
forms the influence of the national language has affected the sentence structures in which
they are used as conj unctions. There is one other Abun word -analo- which is used as a
conjunction, but this word is primarily used as another part of speech. Unlike kapre and
sane, this word, anato shows no influence from Indonesian in the way that it is used. Anato
is primarily a noun modifier with the meaning of 'focus' . It is also used as a conjunction to
link clauses together. Therefore this word fills two categories in Abun grammar. Anato does
not fit into any other type of conj unction described so far, so it is discussed separately to
other conjunctions.
   The word ana-to consists of two morphemes ana 'FOCUS' and to 'NMP' . 4 5 Anato
frequently modifies a noun phrase to bring this noun phrase into focus, j ust like a cleft
construction does in languages that are capable of cleft constructions. Since Abun does not
possess a copula the type of cleft constructions found in English are not possible. Neither are
passive constructions possible in Abun . However, the semantic possibilities engendered by
both the passive and cleft constructions are handled in Abun by means of de-focus and focus
respectively. A noun phrase may be brought into focus by means of anato. In this way
anato functions as a noun modifier, as shown in the examples below.
     12.71     Yewon       anato gu      suk    ne mori.
               shamans FOC         kill thing that afterwards
               1 . The shamans were the ones who killed the things afterwards.
               2. It was the shamans who killed the things afterwards.
     1 2.72    Siri        ne anato ben             suk-ye           wa j i      t6.
               wrong DET FOC               make NOM-difficult for I so           still
               1 . Those sins are still making life hard for me.
               2. It is those sins that are still causing difficulties for me.
   The above examples are grammatically a single clause. In these cases anato always brings
into focus or topicalises the noun that it follows. However, anato plays another role in Abun
grammar. Anato may act as a conj unction to link two clauses together.","[230, 231, 232, 233, 234]"
"   9.27      Yen       kenda da     nu-fa             ne     nu        gato

             1 . People call it the sacred house, the house that must not be seen.
             2. People call it the sacred house, that people must not see the form of it.
   In all these examples, although they represent relativisations of a direct object, the
determiner has not been used. The word order is sufficient to locate the gap, created by the
omission of the head, since prepositional phrases must always follow a direct object. In these
cases the gap is not clause-final and there is no need to indicate the boundary of the restricting
clause. Therefore, whenever there is an adjunct or complement of some kind within the
structure of the restricting clause, the determiner does not need to be used. So a relativisation
of the direct object may have the following composition:                             HEAD+ gata +SUBJ+ VERB+GAP+DET
                                            OR
                               +    +
                     HEAD+ gata SUBJ VERB  +GAP+ADJUNCT/COMPLEMENT
   The same situation is evident when a non-direct object is being relativised. In example
9.28 below, the preposition su 'with' indicates a prepositional phrase. The gap is indicated by
the presence of the preposition without the noun which normally accompanies it. Although
the gap here is clause-final it is part of the prepositional phrase. Part of the phrase is present,
so it is not necessary to use ne since there is another means through which the location of the
gap may be encoded.
   9.28      Suk-i       gato an       kamba     su     an        ye          teker   ware.
             NOM-sick RH.. 3SG wear.out with 3SG difficult too.much FRUS
             The sickness that she was worn out with, she suffered terribly (with it) (so that
             she could not do anything).
   Example 9.29 is similar to example 9.28 .
   9.29      Yen      fro       nggumwak ga men sem mo.
             people prepare room          RH.. 1 PL sleep LOC
             The people prepared a room that we would sleep in.
   The way that the determiner is used is shown in the following summary of restricting
clause types:
RELATfVE CLAUSES                                                                                       1 55      HEAD = SUBJ                GAP + VERB ± OBJECr ± ADJUNcr/COMPLEMENT
      HEAD = OBJ                 SUBJ + VERB + GAP + DET
      HEAD = OBJ                 SUBJ + VERB + GAP + ADJUNcr/COMPLEMFNr
      HEAD= OIHER                SUBJ + VERB + PREP + GAP 1 4
   Therefore, i t appears that the main function of the determiner is t o locate the position o f the
gap within the relative clause when the gap occurs in a clause-final position. Usually it is by
word order that the gap is located within the restricting clause. Since the determiner acts to
close the clause like some kind of boundary marker then it is still possible to locate the gap in
these situations. Giv6n ( 1990:659-660) stated that the gap strategy is most commonly found
in languages with rigid word order, as is the case with Abun. However, he felt that
""processing rate"" would be longer in such languages as well as ""increased error rate, and
increased dependence on context"" (Giv6n 1 990:660ff). If there were no boundary marker, it
would not be fully clear where the gap was and such 'increased errors' as Giv6n describes
could arise. B ut the device of a boundary marker behaves as another means for hearers to
correctly encode what they hear. Together with the relative conjunction gato, the determiner
'brackets' the relative clause. l s There are some instances where some speakers will use ne to
close the relative clause even though the gap is not clause-final. It may be that they want to
add extra certainty that the relative clause is in fact closed and this is made more evident by
the 'bracketing' nature of the determiner.","[166, 167]"

5.3.2 ALIENABLE POSSESSION
     Abun alienable possessive phrases consist of:
                                NP[POSSESSOR] bi NP[POSSESSUM]
   This structure is used for all possessive phrases, except for those discussed above. The
possessor noun phrase is commonly realised as a pronoun as in example 5.84, proper name
as in 5 . 85, and may also be a longer noun phrase as in 5.86. The possessum is a noun phrase
which is commonly realised by a single noun as in 5 . 85 or may be a longer expression as in
5.87.
     5.84        An hi       nggon jam       nde to.
                 3SG poss wife         know NEG INCAM
                 His wife didn ' t know yet.
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                              81   5 . 85    A ndar hi   im       mao
             Andar POss mother come
             Andar's mother came.
   5 . 86    Yetu    ge dik yo      hi         nu       anane.
             person CL one DEf POSS            house    OEM
             This is someone's house.
   5.87      Ji mu mo ji          hi      nggwe jamsem nim ne.
             l SG go LOC l SG POSS garden cassava east DEf
             I went to my eastern cassava garden.
   The linker, bi, i s a free morpheme. Sometimes the possessor can be elided from the
linker, as in example 5.88. Sometimes the possessum can also be elided from the linker, as
in 5 . 89. It is also possible for both possessor and possessum to be elided, as in 5 .90, leaving
the linker stand on its own. In all cases this may occur only when the possessor and
possessum are recoverable from the context. For example, in 5.90, it is known that the
possessum is a wife because that was the topic of discussion.
   5.88      Sadrak bi         im       re     ben hi      suk    ot yeo
             Sadrak poss mother OEM do              poss thing sharp very
             1 . Sadrak' s mother does her things very callously.
             2. Sadrak' s mother is callous.
   5 . 89    Markus i t        mo kwem wokgan gato Martinus hi                        ne.

   5.90      Nan kra   hi          bado    Moses kra   hi,          bado    nzn
             2SG marry poss        or      Moses marry POss         or      2PL
             me-wa ndo.
             see-TRS good
             If you are going to marry yours (wife), or Moses marry his (wife), then take
             good care (of them).
   The Abun possessive phrase construction influences the way Abun speakers construct
their Indonesian. Instead of using standard Indonesian, rumah saya ' my house' , they say
saya punya rumah, as in example 5 .9 1 . The word punya means 'to have, possess' in
Indonesian; however, standard Indonesian does not employ 'have' in possessive phrase
constructions.
  Indonesian:
   5.91      Saya punya rumah roboh.
             l sG POSS     house fallen.down
             My house has fallen down.
  Alienable possessive phrases may be intensified by the addition of i. In this case the form
would be:
                             NP[POSSESSOR] hi NP[POSSESSUM] i
82                                                                                     CHAPTER S
  This particle changes the intensity of possession in a similar way to the English, 'his own
house ' , as distinct from 'his house ' . The following examples illustrate this type of phrase:
     5.92    ji   bi   nu    i
             I SG POSS house lNf
             my own house
     5.93    an    bi      bur      i
             3sG poss      land     lNf
             his own l and
  This type of construction is further used to distinguish two different ownerships in
contrast to each other, as in the following:
     5.94    Ji bi      bur i      anare,       nan bi       bur i  anatu.
             I SG poss land lNf OEM (here) 2sG poss land lNf DEM(there)
             This is my own land here, that is your own land there.
     5.95    Yewon bi    sukduno i             tara      re
             shaman poss teaching lNf          different PERF
             Yefun bi        sukduno          tara        reo
             God    POss teaching       lNf   different PERF
             The shaman ' s own teachings are different to God's own teachings.","[92, 93, 94]"
"   What factors govern the use of the determiner in the relative clause? It is not found in
every instance of a restrictive relative clause. Example 9.22 above has no determiner, in
contrast to example 9.23, in which the restrictive relative clause is closed by the determiner
ne. These two examples differ in two ways. Firstly, in example 9.22 the relativised argument
of the clause has the grammatical relation of subject. In 9.23 the relativised argument has the
grammatical relation of object. Secondly, due to Abun word order the location of the gap in
each restricting clause is different. In example 9.22 the gap is clause-initial since the subject in
Abun is clause-initial. In 9.23 the gap would have been clause-final if the determiner had not
closed the restricting clause. The determiner, by closing the clause, actually assists in locating
the gap, and thereby assists in encoding the grammatical relation of the head.
   The determiner's role in locating the gap is most clearly seen when a direct object is to be
relativised. The determiner ne is used frequently when a direct object is to be relativised, but
not in all instances. To understand how the determiner is used in locating the gap in the
restricting clause, several examples are set out below. In example 9.24 to 9.27 both the head
and the relative conjunction have been highlighted. Further elements within the restricting
clause are underlined to show where the determiner has been omitted. Example 9.24 shows
the determiner as it normally appears, at the end of the relative clause.
   9.24      Men ki nai yu do suk        gato men y e      mo
             I pL say 10 REFL COM things REL IPL difficult exist

             PERF   DEf 1 PL get PERF
             We said to each other that we have the things that we needed.
   In the following examples, 9.25 to 9.27, the omitted direct object is not the final element
of the relative clause, as is the case in 9.24 above, where the determiner ne closes the relative
clause. In examples 9.25 and 9.26 there is a phrase which fol lows the gap, an adjunct phrase
in 9.25 and an indirect object phrase in 9.26.
   9.25      An ndo mo ji bi      nggon subot ji   bi   bllkll

relative clause within the restricting clause. In English this needs to be translated as 'its
body ' , so that a pronoun replacing the head is now within the restricting clause. In these
instances there is now actually no gap (created by the omission of the head) within the
restricting clause because a word such as ka refers to the head, which in this example has the
grammatical relation of direct object. This creates no need for the use of the determiner ne.","[165, 166]"
"9.3 THE RELATIVE CONJUNcrION gato
   The relative conjunction gato is made up of two morphemes: ga 'anaphoric referent/the
former' and to ' noun modifying particle (NMP) ' . Gato may be translated as 'that' , 'which' ,
'who' and so on. In quick speech it is abbreviated to ga, indicating that the particle to, which
carries a grammatical meaning rather than a lexical one, is not always considered necessary.
Gato is not a relative clause pronoun since neither ga nor to can be used on their own to
replace nouns, as will be further discussed below. However, gato cannot be described as a
general subordinating conj unction (as is the case with English 'that' ). Gato is exclusively
used to mark constructions of the restrictive relative clause type. A study of its two
component morphemes shows how it fulfils this role.",[160]
"
5.3.3 RECURSIVE POSSESSIVE PHRASES
  Possessive phrases may be embedded within one another, for alienable possession, by the
addition of the linker and the possessum, as in examples 5.96 and 5 .97, or for inalienable
possession, by the addition of the possessum, as in 5.98.
     5 .96   Rahe! hi            ai     hi nyom
             Rachel poss father POss machete
             Rachel ' s father' s machete

             Rachel poss father arm
             Rachel's father' s arm
5.4 PREPOSmONAL PHRASES
    Prepositional phrases consist of a noun phrase preceded by a preposition. Prepositional
phrases fill dative, locative, instrumental and other adjunct positions in the sentence. Table 5.4
is a list of the prepositions used in Abun with their English equivalent, and categorised into
four different general types. This is Table 3.7 repeated here for convenience.
    A general feature of prepositional phrases that will be illustrated below is the possibility of
ellipsis of the head of the phrase, leaving the preposition stand alone. In such cases the head
is readily recoverable from the context.

because bi only links two noun phrases, whereas this group of prepositions is used for verb
(predicate)-argument NP relations. Each preposition will be discussed in tum.","[94, 95]"

9.5.2 ABUN RELATIVEClAUSES ANDTHE ACCESSIBILITY H1ERARCHY
   Keenan and Comrie ( 1 977) in their work on relative clauses devised a hierarchy they
called the Accessibility Hierarchy which summarised their findings across a wide sample of
languages. They had investigated the types of constraints across languages on which
grammatical relations could be relativised. Comrie ( 1 989: 1 56) later refined this hierarchy so
that ""The hierarchy subject > direct object > non-direct object > possessor defines ease of
accessibility to relative clause formation"". He stated that ( 1 989: 1 56): ""if a language can form
relative clauses on a given position on the hierarchy, it can also form relative clauses on all
positions higher (to the left) on the hierarchy"".
   How do Abun relative clauses compare to this hierarchy? Does this hierarchy hold true
for Abun? In §9.5 . 1 above, several examples were given which showed that various
positions along the hierarchy could be relativised. In fact in Abun all positions on Comrie's
Accessibility Hierarchy can be relativised.
   Keenan ( 1 985 : 1 56), when referring to the different strategies that a language may use to
form relative clauses, noted that ""pronoun retaining strategies are (a) more effective means of
forming RCS (restrictive relative clauses) than RPRO (relative pronoun) or gapping strategies"",14   Probably the formula should contain ± OBJECT, but n o examples with a n object occur i n the corpus
     of data.
15   It i s our experience i n living among Abun speakers that such errors that Giv6n imagines rarely arise.
     Because word order is the main means of encoding grammatical relations, there are very strong
     internal expectations in the mind of the hearer. These expectations are not necessary for languages
     which use case marking or affixation for deriving meaning. The device of the boundary marker is
     strongly used throughout Abun grammar to assist hearers in encoding meaning. It is used in
     negative constructions and in interrogatives. Here, also, the dual particles involved could be
     considered as 'bracketing' devices. These are discussed more fully Chapters 6 and 8.

pronoun was retained. Although Abun does not use a pronoun-retaining strategy, but a gap
strategy, this does not prevent a wide range of positions being relativised. There do not
appear to be restrictions on relative clause formation in Abun. However the last level of the
hierarchy, that of 'possessor', has limited formation possibilities in Abun . Examples 9.30 to
9.37 below illustrate the formation of relative clauses at different levels along the
Accessibility Hierarchy.","[167, 168]"

3.4. 1 NOUN ADJUNCTS
   There are several subclasses of noun adj uncts including the possessive linker hi (for more
detailed use of this linker see §5.3); ten prepositions; many quantifiers (including general
quantifiers, cardinal and ordinal numerals); classifiers and determiners (which have three
sub-subclasses and many compounds forms).
   Below is a list of the prepositions used in Abun with their English equivalent. More
details of their use is found in §5 .4.

     wa                for                              benefactive/purposive
   Quantifiers may be either general or a specific numeral. The general quantifiers are mwa
'many ' , bak 'several' and deyo 'some' . They follow adjectives, when present, in the noun
phrase.
   The Abun numeral system is a decimal system. This is common in the West Papuan
Phylum, to which Abun belongs, but the languages belonging to the neighbouring Trans­
Papuan Phylum, some of which are in the south of the Bird' s Head Peninsula of Irian Jaya,
have a binary and additive system. Table 3 . 8 below lists the Abun numerals. Note that sop
means 'amJ./in addition' . The same word is also used in an syim-sop-kwa 'his arm-addition­
thing: his finger' .

ketke 'first ' , or the dialectal variant, do-futmo 'first' . Every other ordinal numeral is formed
by the combining of do with the appropriate cardinal numeral; for example, do-mumek
'fifth' , do-musyu dik sop we 'twelfth' and so on.
   When the quantifier is a specific numeral, a classifier normally precedes it to indicate
something of the shape and size of the object. There are many types of classifiers that may be
used depending upon the type of noun in the phrase head. In Table 3.9, the common
classifiers are l isted with the types of nouns to which they apply.

with a specific/unspecific distinction, these are yo 'a' and ne 'the' . A second subclass is the
deictics which consist of re 'this ' , ne 'that' and tu 'that (distant) ' . Thirdly, there is a referents
subclass which consists of an anaphoric referent, ga, and an external referent to. Also, the
three deictic particles and the subordinating conjunction to (a different to to the external
referent) form compounds with the referents; as well as the focus or topicaliser particle ana;
the simile particle sa; and the general locative preposition mo, as shown in Table 3 . 1 0 below:                             TABLE 3. 10: DEfERMINER RELATFD COMPOUNDS     Deictic       re                         ne                     tu                 to

   There are two subclasses in the closed class of verb adjuncts. First there are certain verbs
that combine with verbal particles. These particles, such as ma 'come' , mu 'go' and kem
'stay' do double duty as verbs, but when used as verbal particles are discontinuous with the
verb and follow the object; see §5. 1 for more details. Some of the verbal particles, like w e
'away ' , are not used as any other part of speech. Some verbs with verbal particles are listed
in Table 3. 1 1 below:

A second subclass consists of four predicate marker particles which always directly
precede the verb when present. The meanings of the predicate markers range across the entire
spectrum of concepts that are normal ly referred to as tense, aspect or mood.6 See § 1 0 for
more details. They are contained in Table 3 . 1 2 below:                                    TABlE 3. 12: PREDlCATEMARKERS          Particle                    Meaning                            Used in

5.4. 1 DATIVE PHRASES
   A phrase filling the dative function is a prepositional phrase with either is or nai as the
preposition. These two prepositions are dialectal variants, is i s used in Abun Ji and nai i s
used in Abun Y e and Abun Tat. Tills prepositional phrase type is distinguished from other
types because Abun speakers strongly prefer to place it directly following the object of the
sentence.
   As with all prepositional phrases, the preposition precedes a noun phrase such as a
possessive phrase as in example 5.99, a noun phrase as in 5 . 1 00, or the ellipsis thereof as in
5.101.
   5 .99 a. Nggon n e syo suk-ne               nai an             hi       im.

5.4.2 SPACIo-TEMPORAL PHRASES
   A group of phrases with the prepositions mo, bot, kagit, karowa, ket and wade generally
have locative, directional or temporal notions. Locative (mo) prepositional phrases are by far
the most cornmon type, and they differ structurally to the other types in this category. Again,
each spacio-temporal prepositional phrase consists of a preposition followed by a noun
phrase. Of the several prepositions listed in the table above under this type, each will be
discussed in tum below.(i) mo
     Mo is the general locative preposition meaning 'in, at, to' , as seen in the examples below:
     5 . 1 02   Ye     mu nai su-git           mo nggwe.
                people go get NOM-eat LOC garden
                They went to get food at the garden.
     5 . 1 03   Men mu mo Filipus hi        nu .
                1 PL g o   LOC Filipus POss house
                We went to Filipus' house.
  Several locative prepositional phrases may occur together such as in example 5 . 1 04. Both
mo and bot have a tendency for recursiveness. The limitations to the number of phrases
appear to be pragmatic.
     5 . 1 04   Yen    taru             mu ma nje            mo nden        mo Syubun.
                people send. message go       LOC people LOC bush           LOC Syubun
                They sent a message to the people in the bush at Syubun.
   Mo is a general locative preposition, and when a more specific location, such as 'in front
of' , 'next to' , or 'behind' is intended, another locative word further specifies the location.
Such modifications are found only in locative prepositional phrases where the preposition is
mo. For example:                      mo nu mit             inside the house
                      mo nu git             in front of the house
                      mo nu yu              on top of the house
                      mo nu ke              at the base of the house
                      mo nu ndet            in between the houses
                      mo nu nim             above the house
                      mo banba nim          eastern mountain
                      mo nu de              at the side of the house
                      mo nu deju            upstream side of the house
                      mo nu de ti           sea side of the house
                      mo nu de dari         behind the house
                      mo nu de rut          at the back of the house
                      mo nu des nak         underneath the house
                      mo nu de nden         outside the house
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                               8S   These locative words which follow the head of a locative phrase could be described as
'relator nouns ' . They can become the head of the phrase when the actual head of the phrase is
elided, such as mo mit 'inside (the house) ' , and mo nden 'outside (the house) ' .
     Many of the relator nouns are preceded by de 'side ' , as can be seen in the list above. So
the form of the locative prepositional phrase may be further defined as: mo + NP, where an
adelitional modifier, a relator noun or [de + relator noun] can be included preceding the
determiner and fol lowing other modi fiers in the noun phrase, such as in examples S . l OSa and
S . 106a.
   When the same directional word or relator noun fol lows the determiner of the phrase the
meaning is different. Compare example S. l OSa with S . 1 0Sb, and S . 1 06a with S . 1 06b. In the
latter cases the directional word is now outside of the prepositional phrase. When it is within
the prepositional phrase (which has its boundary delineated by the determiner) it modifies the
head of the phrase.

              b. mo Nyarwon bi          nu     ne de ju
                 LOC Nyarwon POss house DET side upstream
                 at Nyarwon ' s house, upstream side
  Recursive prepositional phrases may also include relator words. For example:
   S . 1 07      mo nggwe mo banbo                   tatu    nim
                 LOC garden LOC mountain distant east
                 at the garden on the elistant eastern mountain
   S . 108       mo nggwe more jll
                 LOC garden close upstream
                 at the nearby upstream garden
   More than one relator noun in either order (yu nim or nim yu) can moelify the noun head
of a phrase. For example:
   S . 1 09 a.   mo banbo          yu nim ne
                 LOC mountain top east DET
                 on the top of the eastern mountain
              b. mo banbo          nim yll ne
                 LOC mountain east top DET
                 on the top of the eastern mountain

(ii) subot/bot
   Bot, which is a shortening of subot, introduces a phrase which could be described as
perlative in meaning, that is 'about, along or through ' . Bot is preferred in fast speech. The
following examples i l lustrate this type of prepositional phrase. Bot has undergone a process
of grarnrnaticalisation to become a suffix on some verbs, as discussed in §3.3 . 1 .
     5. 1 10    Pa          siker nok         bot    kwa-yo-kwa-yo.
                young.man tease wild. pig about thing-a-thing-a
                The young men teased the wild pig about many things.
     5.1 1 1    An   mu subot yen ne ke t             ya ne.
                3sG go along sand DEf west flat DEf
                He went along the sand in a westerly direction on the flat part.
   This type of prepositional phrase can be recursive, as in example 5 . 1 12. Speakers have a
strong preference for bot phrases to precede mo phrases, as seen in 5 . 1 1 3 , and, when the
noun phrase is recoverable from the context, ellipsis of the phrase itself i s possible, leaving
only the preposition as in 5 . 1 14.
     5. 1 1 2   An     saye bot       nu      bot     nden    nu      de    ne J U .
                3sG shout about house about outside house side DEf upstream
                1 . She shouted (for me) about the houses, about the outside of the houses j ust
                up to the upstream side (of the village).
                2. She shouted out (for me) outside each house on the upstream side (of the
                village).
     5.113      An    gu      bot     rus     mo kampung          ne.
                3SG kill about family LOC village                 DEf
                She killed all the families in the village.
     5. 1 14    Nggon m ise syun ma            bot.
                woman evil     chase come about
                The evil woman chased after (them).(iii) kagitlkadit
   Here again is a dialect variation, kadit and kagit are identical in meaning and use. This
preposition has several shades of meaning. The basic meaning is 'from' , and this can be
from a location as in example 5 . 1 1 5 , a situation as in 5 . 1 16, or a point in time as in 5 . 1 1 7 .
     5. 1 15    An m a     kagit Filipus bi            nu.
                3sG come from Filipus poss             house
                He came from Filipus' s house.
     5.1 16     An ge         kadit an     bi         suki     ne.
                3sG healed from 3SG poss              sickness DEf
                He is healed from the sickness.

   The preposition karowa means 'near, close to' , and may also be used as an adverb. Its
main use is locative as in examples 5. 1 1 8 and 5 . 1 l 9a, but it is also used in a temporal sense
as in 5. 1 20. In some contexts the head of the phrase can be elided, leaving the preposition
stand alone as in 5 . 1 1 9b.
   5. 1 1 8      Men mu mo os            m it     karowa nu-arz              Ebenezer.

                 We were walking on the middle of the road near the church, Ebenezer.

                 2SG go      near      NEG
                 Don't go near (Moses' place).

                 near       sun     cool
                 Close to sunset...(v) ket
     The form ket is another locative preposition. It precedes the location of the path of the
action. For example, the location of the path where goods were being carried in example
5 . 1 2 1 is along the ground, that is by foot, and the location of the path of the movement in
5 . 1 22 was towards the interior (rather than the sea). The preposition undergoes
grammaticalisation to become a suffix on some verbs and this is discussed in §3.3 . 1 .
   5.121         Men sam suk          ket bur.
                 I PL carry things LOC earth
                 We carried the things, walking along.

                 I sG do     LOC I SG desires
                 I did (things) according to my desires.(vi) wadelkom mo
  Another type of spacio-temporal prepositional phrase is formed with the preposItIOn
wade/kom mo 'until/for' . These two forms are used interchangeably. For example:

1 2.7 NEGATIVE CONJUNCTIONS
   The final group of Abun conjunctions all contain the negative particle onde. When a single
clause is negated in Abun it is negated by means of two particles which bracket the verb
phrase. So clause negation has the structure:
                                 SUBJECT + yo + VERB PHRASE + nde
   But there is another type of negation in Abun which occurs on the level of the complex
sentence. Within a complex sentence whatever is expressed by the first clause can be negated
by means of onde. Onde always occurs together with some other conjunction. These create a
group of conjunctions which are termed 'negative' conjunctions. Sentences that use these
negative conjunctions have the following structure:
                             CLAUSE 1 + onde-CONJUNCTION + CLAUSE 2
   Semantically this is most basically expressed as 'not clause one, clause two ' . It has been
claimed earlier in this chapter that Abun complex sentences show much influence from
Papuan languages. It is interesting to note that Barai, an unrelated Papuan language, also has
two distinct means of negation. In the words of Foley and Van Valin ( 1 984: 1 92), one of
these ""ba ... negates the entire clause and roughly means 'it is not the case that' .. .it is the only
element that ever follows the verb in heavily verb-final B arai"". The fact that this form has an
equivalent meaning to the Abun onde is another factor which confirms the influence of
Papuan languages on Abun syntax.
   Table 1 2 .4 below lists all the negative conjunctions. Fuller explanations and examples of
each are given afterwards.
                                TABLE 1 2.4: NEGATIVE CONJUNCTIONS                         C ONJUNCTION                    MEANING

   The negative meaning of onde can be clearly understood when it is part of the contrastive
conj unction onde-wo. Any clauses linked by onde need to be understood semantically in the
following way:        CLAUSE 1                       onde-                                CLAUSE 2
        event asserted                 not the case, instead                reallaltemative event
The event expressed by clause one is stated positively; it is not marked as negative within the
clause by means of the negative particles yo and nde. However, whatever was asserted by
clause one is not the case, and so this clause is negated by means of onde. Therefore the
event expressed by clause two is, in the speaker' s opinion, the real situation. If the clause i s
linked b y a negative conj unction other than ondewo, the event expressed b y clause two
indicates an alternative situation to that expressed in clause one. Thus ondewo links clauses
expressing a false and true contrast. For example:
   1 2.77    Yenggras      njim    do  re   ndar       syut       nok      ondewo
             elders        think   COM here dogs       bark.at    wild.pig but.really
             ndar syut     pa       kaiyi.
             dogs bark.at child actual
             The old men thought that the dogs were barking at a wild pig but actually the
             dogs were barking at a child.
   1 2.78    An     ki     do Sem       ana ben  brek            ne      ges    ondewo
             3sG    say    COM Sem      FOC make plate           DEI'    fall   but.really
             an    dakai ben      ges.
             3SG self        make fall
             He said that Sem was the one who made the plate fall but really he himself
             caused (it) to fall.
(ii) onde-sa 'otherwise (would)'
   Onde-sa is made up of the sentence negator onde and the realis or past time conjunction
sa. The combined meaning of the two creates a conjunction that is counterfactual. Again the
structure of the sentence using onde-sa is broken down semantically below to explain clearly
the meaning of these types of sentences.
       CLAUSE 1                     onde-sa                             CLAUSE 2
       event asserted               (if) not so, instead                different outcome, past
   The event expressed by clause one is given in the indicative. These events may or may not
be true. The second clause describes a situation that would arise in the event that clause one
was negated. Onde represents the negation. Sa indicates a past time setting to both the event
and the outcome described. In this type of sentence both the event and the outcome may refer
to hypothetical situations. Even so, sa indicates that whether hypothetical or not the events in
question would have occurred at some time in the past, rather than in the future. In these
sentences onde links clauses in a counterfactual manner giving the meaning: 'If the events
expressed by clause one had not happened then the events expressed by clause two would
have ' . Since Abun has no English equivalent to the conditional 'if' , this meaning is merely
for the purposes of good translation. However ""Counter-fact propositions need not be
226                                                                                    CHAPTER 12associated with conditional ADY clauses."" (Giv6n 1 990:83 1 ), as is the case here. That is to
say, a counterfactual proposition does not need to be marked by overt conditional means
only. A language may use other means to indicate this. For example:
   1 2.79     Su-gane men ku           Ron onde-sa,              men yo       ku sugum
              with-that 1 PL meet      Ron otherwise-REAL        1 PL NEG     get money
              wa men ma            nde.
              for 1 PL come NEG
              1 . At that time we met Ron, otherwise we would not have had money to come
                 (here).
              2. If, at that time, we hadn't met Ron we would not have had money to come
                 here.
   In the sentence above clause one expresses a factual situation which did actually
occur-the participants met a man who gave them money. Clause two expresses a
hypothetical situation which would have arisen if they had not received the money-they
would not have been able to pay for fares to return to their village. The usage of sa indicates
to hearers that this speculation i s about past events. Example 1 2.80 below i s similar. It
contains the variant onde-sor-sa. This adds a component of meaning similar to 'it was j ust as
well that...'
   1 2.80     Nu-won       ga mo A iwom ndo, ndo sato         yewon yo                        gu
              house-shaman REL at Aiwom good good for.example shamans NEG                     kill

              RER.. again NEG but otherwise-just-REAL later people kill RER.. still
              1 . It was good that they set up a shaman training school at Aiwom. It was good
                  in that the shamans didn't kil l each other any more. B ut otherwise they would
                  stil l be killing each other.
               2. It was good that they set up a shaman training school at Aiwom. It was good
                    in that the shamans didn ' t kill each other any more. B ut if not they would
                    still be killing each other.
   In the preceding two examples the meaning component that sa adds to these clauses is
that of its primary meaning-it is functioning as a tensed conjunction indicating past time.
The following example differs from 1 2 .79 and 1 2.80 above in that here sa is functioning
according to its secondary usage-it adds the notion of 'subjunctive' to the first clause. Abun
has no lexical equivalent to the subjunctive 'should' . Therefore the translation of 1 2. 8 1 below
indicates this.
   1 2. 8 1   Nin   mbros     kwem     ne     sino,   onde-sa              pa

              You should have all rowed that canoe, otherwise if one of you rowed alone and
              then there was a really violent wind, then what would he have done?
   Example 1 2. 8 1 above is a reprimand by an older woman to certain young people. A s
such it could also be translated a s 'Would that you had all rowed that canoe' . This also is
PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                            227subj unctive. It expresses a wish or desire that past events could have occurred in a better
way.46 As such this clause refers to a hypothetical past event. What actually happened in this
case was that one young man was left to row the canoe alone against a strong wind.'
    Because Abun has no morpheme to represent a hypothetical situation such as the English
'if' , it is only by context and knowledge of the events described that hearers encode what is
hypothetical and what is fact. The function of onde is to negate the contents of the preceding
clause. On its own it does not attach truth value to these clauses. Therefore when onde is part
of the conj unction onde-wo, it is used to express the semantic notion of 'contrary to
expectation ' . When part of the conjunctions onde-sa and onde-yo, onde i s used to express
the notion of 'contrary to fact' .
(iii) onde-yo 'otherwise (will)'
   Onde-yo differs in meaning from onde-sa in the matter of time setting only. In clauses
linked by onde-sa, the 'tensed' conjunction sa indicates to hearers that the time setting of the
sentence and its contents are in the past, events described therein have already occurred.
However, when the conj unction changes to yo, hearers understand that the event expressed
by the second clause is non-past. These events have not actually occurred and may be
hypothetical in nature also.

                  biscuits !
  Givon ( 1990: 8 3 1 ) makes the following comments about counterfactual conditionals
which are relevant to this discussion of negative conjunctions.
       In addition to the subordinators that (may) mark them, counterfact clauses tend
       to be marked, cross-linguistically, by a combination of two semantically
       conflicting verbal inflections:
       (a) A prototypical realis operator, such as past, perfective or perfect: and,
       (b) A prototypical irrealis operator, such as: future, subjunctive, conditional
           or a modal.
   According to Givon this 'semantic conflict' arises if a clause is marked with both a realis
and irrealis 'operator' or one clause may be marked realis and the other irrealis. This situation
may arise as given in example 1 2.83 below. The first clause is marked by the perfect aspect
marker reo However, the usage of onde-yo in sentences is very similar to the usage of the
46    Just as Abun has no word for the modal 'should' neither does it have an equivalent to the
      subjunctive verb 'wish' . The subjunctive usage of sa is the nearest Abun equivalent for expressing
      this notion.
228                                                                                  CHAPTER 12conj unction yo on its own. If a sentence describes a predictive or procedural situation, then
onde-yo is used.
   1 2.83    Yen       gu     or           re, onde-yo             ye       si      rna
             people    kill   completely   PERF otherwise-IRR      people   go.with come
             rno nu       de, yen         bi    n                nai.
             to house side people give ginger.root 10
             They would kill off (all those people). If this is not possible the (young) people
             with them (the older shamans) will come to the side of the house (and) give
             ginger root to (the people they want to kill).
    Onde should not be understood as a negative conditional such as the English ' unless ' . It is
possible to give an alternative translation for example 1 2.83 above as 'Unless you sweep up
that mess down there, you won't get any biscuits ! ' However, as seen in examples 1 2.77 and
1 2.78 above, which use onde-wo, onde does not always have the meaning of a negative
conditional. When used as part of onde-wo it has the meaning of negative contrast. Usage of
onde indicates some kind of semantic contrast between the propositions involved. This i s
achieved b y negation o f the content o f the first clause.
(iv) onde-bere 'otherwise.cERT'
   This conjunction differs from the others by the addition of the time word bere
'FlITURFfIater' . There are several variants of bere which need to be explained. These three
variants concern the differences in the way Abun speakers view future time. These variants
are:
                       ber     soon, shortly
                       bere    later, definitely�will
                       be      later, likely/probably� could    All these variants could be translated as 'later' or 'will' in regards to future time. Ber is
used to indicate that the future time specified is in the near future. However, with bere and
be the matter of future time proximity is unspecified. What is specified is the degree of
certainty that the speaker attaches to the future event described. Hence, if the speaker feels
that the event is a certainty then bere is used, meaning 'definitely will ' . If the speaker
attaches less certainty to the future event taking place then be is used, meaning 'probably
will' or 'could'. Both these time words can be joined to onde to create counterfactual
conjunctions. These conjunctions link events that are non-past or future time in the same way
as the conjunction onde-yo. By choosing onde-bere or onde-be rather than onde-yo the
speaker adds the semantic element of 'degree of certainty' which is not present in the case of
onde-yo. In regard to counterfactuals Givon ( 1 990: 832) notes that ""many languages allow
further gradation, most particularly of events/states that are j udged to be unlikely but not
altogether impossible"". The gradations referred to here are from possibly true to not true.
The gradation expressed in Abun is in the other direction, from probable to certain . Abun has
no adverb or modal form which means 'definitely' or 'certainly' . Thus these concepts have
been incorporated into these future time words. Examples showing the use of onde-bere and
onde-be are given below:
PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                                229   1 2.84    Nan ma   kem su    ji                   more, onde-bere           suk-onde         re

             2. If you don' t go and get it I could beat you !
(v) onde-ge 'otherwise-then'
   This final counterfactual conjunction does not indicate time setting of the clauses involved.
The conjunction ge 'then' is joined to onde to indicate sequence of events. It is not as
frequently used as the other counterfactuals. The example below has several variant
translations since the negative contrast indicated by onde can be rendered in several ways in
English.

                 her with sorcery (lit. ginger root), otherwise then they will bring her to the
                 shaman-house and then spear her (to death).
             2. That woman, (that) he had committed adultery with, like that, they will kill
                her with sorcery (lit. ginger root), failing that then they will bring her to the

                 her with sorcery (lit. ginger root), if this is not possible then they w i l l bring
                 her to the shaman-house.
  This concludes the discussion of negative conjunctions and it concludes the discussion of
Abun conjunctions covered in this work.

5.6 QUANTIFIER PHRASES
     A quantifier phrase consists of:
                                        (CLASSIFIER *) QUANTIFIER                                (*a classifier is obligatory for cardinal numerals)   A classifier indicates something about the shape or size of an object that is head of a noun
phrase, in the same way as ' loaves' in the English, three loaves of bread. There are many
types of classifiers that may be used depending upon the type of noun in the phrase head,
such as ge for persons or animals; and gwes for long items like pieces of bamboo. In §3.4. 1 ,
Table 3.9 lists each classifier and the types of nouns to which they apply.
  General quantifiers are mwa 'many ' , bok 'several ' and de 'some/part' . With more
commonly used nouns, c lassifiers have a greater tendency to be absent. Some examples are:
     5.151         yenggras     (ge) bok       ne
                   old.men      CL     several DEf
                   the several old respected men
     5. 152        yenggras    (ge) m wa n e
                   old.men     CL    many DEf
                   the many old respected men
     5 . 1 53      Men git we u        (bo) de   yo.
                   1 PL eat banana CL       some DEf
                   We ate some of the bananas.
     5 . 1 54      Minda     kri     (ge) m wa ok kadit pe                            ne.
                   butterfly yellow CL       many fly from place                      DEf
                   Many yellow butterflies flew away from that place.
     5. 1 5 5      An    nai jamsem      (is)        m wa.
                   3SG get cassava       CL          many
                   He took many cassava.
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                             93   An Ordinal numeral, which may be head of a quantifier phrase, i s formed by a
combination of do 'the one which' and the numeral, except for do-ketke 'first' , or the
dialectal variant, do-futmo 'first' . A classifier is optional with these. Some examples are:
   5 . 1 56   wam do-ketke
              time the. one. which-one
              first time
   5 . 1 57   nu      gwes kok         kwat    do-gri
              house leg       high platform the.one.which-three
              the house on stilts' third level
   5 . 1 58   An     git we u      (bo) do-at.
              3SG eat banana CL          the.one. which-four
              He is eating the fourth banana.
   Cardinal numerals may also be head of a quantifier phrase. Classifiers, however, are
obligatory when a cardinal numeral is used, except for a few common cases such as an (ge)
we 'they two ' , where the classifiers are sometimes elided due to common usage. Some
examples of the use of cardinal numbers are seen in examples 5 . 1 59 to 5 . 1 62 below.
Cardinal numerals are listed in Table 3.8.
   5 . 1 59   weubam      bo    at

              four pineapples

              three people
5.7 COMPLEX PHRASES
   Complex phrases consist of two basic types, coordination and apposition.
   Regarding the first of these, coordination, all languages possess strategies that permit
various types of coordination to occur at the phrasal and sentential level, thereby forming
complex phrases and sentences. According to Payne ( 1 985a:3), there are ""five basic co­
ordination types which are realised linguistically both at phrasal and sentential levels:
conj unction (p and q), postsection (p and not q), presection (not p and q), disjunction (p or q)
and rejection (not p and not q; not p or q)"".
  Payne ( 1 985a:3) claims that most languages treat postsection, presection and rejection
analytically as a combination of conjunction and negation, or disj unction and negation; that is,
94                                                                                     CHAPTER 5there is no distinct synthetic form. Abun also treats these three types of coordination
analytically. Therefore only conjunction and disjunction are distinct categories in Abun.
   The second basic type of complex phrase is that of apposition. Since this is structurally the
same as one type of coordination (simple juxtaposition), it will be discussed under that
section.
   Table 5.5 following summarises each complex noun phrase type and structure that will be
discussed below.","[104, 105, 106]"
"
10.3. 1 . 1 ABUN VERB MORPHOLOGY
   Applying traditional labels such as infinitive or participial to Abun is difficult. Since Abun
lacks subject-verb agreement and various other means by which the verb may be marked,
the structural definitions that are applied to complement types of other languages (synthetic
rather than isolating languages) cannot be applied to Abun. In Abun the morphological shape
of the verb never changes. It is invariant. There are no verb participles in Abun so it is not
possible to have a participial complement. Neither is there an infinitive in Abun.
   Determining what an infinitive is for Abun is somewhat difficult in that such definitions
are usually based on variations of the basic verb, showing person-number marking of the
subject. As has already been stated the Abun verb is invariant since changes to aspect and
mood are carried by particles and subject-verb agreement is not marked in Abun. If an
infinitive is said to be a verb that is 'not able to take a subject NP' , this definition is also
problematic because verbs in Abun normally take a subject P. In Abun, verbs are never said
in isolation. For example, if an enquiry is made as to the Abun terms for such words as
'come' and 'go' the reply is always given using a personal pronoun, usually second person
singular. Therefore 'come' would be given as nan rna 'you come' and 'go' would be given
as na rnu 'you go' . An infinitive cannot be elicited because such a verbal form does not exist.
On some occasions the overt subject of a clause may be omitted, but this is an option the
speaker has and is not obligatory. Predicates which take the -wa suffix may allow the subject
of the complement clause to be elided if it is co-referential with the subject of the main
clause. For example:
   10.56     Ji i-wa          da      ron        a-reo
             l sG happY-TRs drink medicine Foc-this
             I am happy to (or agree to) take some medicine now.
   This type of ellipsis is not common, as it i s more usual that the subject is repeated. In
either case the form of the verb is the same whether there is a subject NP or not. Therefore it
is not possible to determine what is an infinitive verb form in Abun. Since Abun verb
morphology is always invariant it cannot be stated that Abun has a separate infinitive verb
form. Neither does it have a participial form. It follows then that because Abun has no verbal
infinitives, neither can it have infinitive complements. Therefore, this means of encoding a
complement clause by means of distinctive verb morphology is not applicable for Abun .
Because changes to verb morphology within the complement clause cannot identify
complement types, other methods need to be used.
   Giv6n did not list any other means of syntactically encoding a complement clause. The
various means that he has described, with the exception of the ""subordinating morpheme"",
are all means of identifying the complement clause as such by some type of syntactic
marking within the complement clause itself. These means have proved unproductive for
Abun. Noonan ( 1 985 :44), like Giv6n, lists various ways of identifying complement clauses
one being ""the external syntactic relations of the complement construction as a whole"". It
seems that for Abun the only way of identifying complement clauses is not from inside the
embedded complement clause but from outside of it. One such means is the
1 80                                                                                          CHAPTER 10complementiser. If there is no complementiser, as in the cases under discussion here, there is
other evidence external to the complement clause which can indicate that it is embedded
within the main clause. There are various structural indications of subordination in Abun .
Two of them will be given here to provide evidence that these complement clauses are, in
fact, subordinate to the main clause as embedded objects. The first deals with the structure of
a negative sentence; the second concerns the transitive implications of the suffixes on the
main clause verbs found in these types of construction.","[191, 192]"

3 .3.2.5 RELATOR NOUNS
    The final noun subclass is relator nouns. These may appear in some cases as the head or
as a modifier in a locative prepositional phrase (see §5.4.2 for examples). Words in this
subclass can be broken into two subsubclasses, those that stand on their own and those that
compound with de 'side ' . There are nine in the former group and six in the latter. These are
listed in the following two tables:                                     TABLE 3.4: RElATOR NOUNS                             Relator Noun            Meaning

                               de nden            outside
3.3.3 ADJECTIVES
   Adjectives are a class of words denoting qualities or attributes, which in Abun functionally
modify nouns and frequently function as predicates as in example 3.4 1 a. Adjectives are
distinct from verbs in that they function as head of adjectival phrases and, in those phrases,
can specify degree such as comparative and superlative as in example 3.4 1b, c. Furthermore,
36                                                                                   CHAPTER 3although structurally both adjectives and verbs directly follow the predicate marker yo, verbs
never directly precede the intensifier wai, whereas adjectives do.
     3.4 1 a.     Yenggras           ne    nggi.
                  old/respected.man DEf    strong
                  The old man is strong.
             b.   Yenggras           ne     nggi    wai     kadit nan.
                  old/respected.man DEf     strong  INf     from 2SG
                  The old man is stronger than you.
             c.   Yenggras            ne   nggi      wai ore.
                  old/respected.man DEf strong       INf complete
                  The old man is the strongest.
   The class of adjectives in Abun hovers on the borderline of being an open or closed word
class. While on the one hand adjectives do occur as predicates and also specify degree, which
are features of an open class of adjectives, many adjectival meanings are expressed through
verbs, which is more typical of a language with a closed adjective class according to
Schachter ( 1 985: 1 6).
     Relativisation of verbs express the equivalent of a modifying adjective. For example:
     3.42         Pa gato jam           suk    m wa   rna.
                  child REL      know things many come
                  1 . The boy who knows many things came.
                  2. The intelligent boy came.
     3 .43        An    sok-bot      nu-syo           gato    kak    ne.
                  3sG enter-along house-mouth         REL     open   DEf
                  He entered though the open door.
   Among the adjectives which modify the head of a noun phrase, syntactically only one
class can be distinguished, because only one adjective can modify a noun head in a noun
phrase. The modification of a noun by more than one adjective requires the use of other
constructions which are discussed in §5.2. 1 .
   In the corpus of data to hand a total of 3 8 adjectives has been distinguished, but there may
well be others, thus it is included as an open word class. Semantically, distinctions can be
made to form groups of colour, size, quality or age adjectives, but syntactically they all
function in the same way.
     There is one adjective compound formed by two adjectives, [ADJ-ADJ] Adj' wok-gan 'small­
little: young and smal l ' .","[47, 48]"
"
1 1 .2 'TENSED' CONJUNCTIONS
   The Abun language does not distinguish a separate category of 'tense' for simple clauses.
Simple clauses are marked by means of particles for mood, that is for sentences which are
interrogative and imperative, for aspect, and for modality. None of these particles i s
obligatory and when used is always found in the clause-final position (see §4.5 for a fuller
description of this). However, there are two conjunctions frequently used in Abun which
mark the clauses concerned in time frames in a less defined way than is normally the case for
tense marking. Foley ( 1 986: 1 59ff.), in his comparison of Papuan languages, uses a term
'status' to describe time settings which are less precisely defined than the traditional term
'tense' . His term STATUS can be loosely divided two ways, into 'real ' time and 'unreal' time.
'Real' status refers to events occurring both in the past and present up to the moment of
speaking. 'Unreal ' status is for events that are yet to occur, including not only those that are
considered certain but also only those in the scope of the possible or hypothetical. In Abun
this distinction is marked by two temporal conjunctions: sa, which is considered 'REAUS',
and yo ' IRREALIS ' . For Abun usage the term REALIS is used to refer to events which are already
past or are continuing up to the present time. The term IRREAUS i s used to refer to events that
are yet to happen, are likely to happen or are completely hypothetical. 3 2
   Interestingly in his comparison of Papuan languages. Foley distinguishes aspect and
modality (his 'inner operators' ) from tense, status and mood ( ,outer operators ' ). Foley does
not use the term 'mood' but instead describes it as 'illocutionary force' (see Foley
1 986: 143ff.). In Papuan languages aspect and modality are usually indicated in some way on
the verb stem and are part of the predicate. B ut tense and the other 'outer operators' tend to
be realised grammatically in different ways, on the sentence level. While Abun has not been
classified as a Papuan language but is rather a West Papuan language, nevertheless this
generalisation made for Papuan languages appears to have some significance. In Abun,
aspect and modality particles are always part of a single clause. Status, that is the difference
between realis and irrealis time, occurs only at the complex sentence level. In this way there
appears to be a distinction in that the concepts of REAUS and IRREAUS are not marked on the
individual clause in Abun, as is commonly the case in many languages, but are marked on
the sentence by means of a conjunction.
   The usage of these two 'tensed' or temporal conjunctions in Abun sentences is compared
below.",[205]

5.2 NOUN PHRASES
   An Abun noun phrase typically has the following structure:                               HEAD (MODIFIERS) (DETERMrNER)
    The head of a noun phrase is normally filled by a member of the noun word class as in
example 5 . 10, but may also be filled by a pronoun, as in 5. 1 1 , with a restricted set of
modifiers. In other words, other nouns and adjectives do not co-occur with a pronoun when
it is head of a noun phrase; only classifiers, quantifiers and determiners may co-occur with
pronouns, as seen in 5 . 1 1 .
68                                                                                         CHAPTER 5     5.10          Ndar     kwo     git     boge     ge we       or          reo
                   dog    white eat fish      CL two completely              PERF
                   The white dog had completely eaten the two fish.
     5. 1 1        A n ka w e n e           git boge.
                   3PL CL two OEf           eat fish
                   Those two ate fish.
   A proper name will usually occur alone, but may be modified by a relative clause, as seen
in example 5 . 12.
     5.12          Mauren      gato       kwop re...
                   Mauren   REI..  die     recently
                   Mauren who had died recently ...
   Modifiers are optional. The types, their order and co-occurrence restrictions are discussed
below in §5.2. 1 .
   Determiners, like modifiers, are optional. They are used less frequently than determiners
are in English. They will be discussed in §5.2.2 below.
  Since modifiers and determiners are optional, frequently a noun phrase consists of a single
noun. For example:
     5.13          Fredik     bari-wa          git     yetu.
                   Fredik not.want-TRs eat people
                   Fredik does not want to eat people.
    Noun phrases fill subject and object positions, as seen in the examples below. They also
fill head positions in possessive and prepositional phrases and these will be discussed in §5.3
and §5.4 respectively.
     5. 1 4        Men dakai git nok                 ku        koi bok     yo.
                   1 PL REfL eat wild. pig      flesh CL several OEf
                   We ourselves ate several pieces of wild pig meat.

                   Two men hit the red dog with a piece of wood.","[79, 80]"

3.3.4 ADVERBS
   The class of adverbs, which function as modifiers of constituents other than nouns
(Schachter 1 985:20), is a heterogeneous group in Abun consisting of several subclasses,
'directional ' adverbs, 'time' adverbs, 'manner' adverbs and 'degree' adverbs. Directional and
degree adverb subclasses are closed, and the number of manner adverbs is limited. Time
adverbs have more flexibility with some compounding evident.
MORPHOLOGYAND WORD Cu.sSES                                                                    37   The first subclass is directional adverbs. These include words such as nim 'east(erly) ' , ju
'upstream' and act as adverbs when they occur outside the phrase, that i s directly fol lowing a
determiner as in examples 3 .44b and 3.45b. This same subclass of words (listed as relator
nouns above) may also occur within the phrase to modify the head of a locative prepositional
phrase as seen in 3.44a and 3 .45a. This subclass of relator nouns does 'double duty ' , acting
both as modifiers of a phrase and as a closed subclass of directional adverbs, in which case
they occur outside the phrase.
   3.44 a.    mo banbo          sye nim ne
              LOC mountain big east DEY
              on the big eastern mountain
         b. mo banbo        sye ne       nim
            LOC mountain big DEY east
            on the big mountain in the easterly direction
   3 .45 a.   mo Nyarwon bi           nu    de-ju               ne
              LOC Nyarwon POss house side-upstream              DEY
              on the upstream side of Nyarwon' s house
         b. mo Nyarwon bi            nu     ne       de-ju
            LOC Nyarwon poss house DEY               side-upstream
            at Nyarwon ' s house, upstream side
    The second subclass of adverbs is time adverbs, which consists of words such as i k
'tomorrow ' , kamekre 'yesterday' , and compound constructions like kam-dik-kam-dik 'day­
one-day-one: everyday' and ber-gan 'later-little: shortly' . These adverbs are usually sentence­
initial in their distribution, but may also be part of the predicate. This subclass of adverbs
alone has considerable options in its placement in the sentence. For example:
   3.46 a.    Kam-dik-kam-dik an      ma    mo j i            bi       nu.
              day-one-day-one    3SG  come  LOC I SG          poss     house
              Everyday he came to my house.
         b. A n kam-dik-kam-dik ma        mo j i             bi       nu.
            3SG day-one-day-one    come LOC I sG             POSS     house
            Everyday he came to my house.
         c. An ma      kam-dik-kam-dik mo ji                 bi       nu.
            3sG come day-one-day-one      LOC I sG           POSS     house
            He came everyday to my house.
         d. A n ma     mo j i     bi     nu kam-dik-kam-dik.
            3sG come LOC I SG POSS house day-one-day-one
            He came to my house everyday.
   The third subclass of adverbs is manner adverbs. This subclass is not as 'open' as a
regular open class because many adverbial meanings are expressed in other ways, such as
associative prepositional phrases su sangge 'with truth : truly', or the use of adjectives without
any special markings. Schachter ( 1985 : 22) mentions this possibility, noting that there are
languages in which the class of adjectives do double duty, modifying verbs as well as nouns.
Abun' s adjectives do that type of double duty; for example, ndo in example 3 .47 i s a manner
38                                                                                     CHAPTER 3adverb, whereas ndo in example 3.48 is an adjective. Alternatively, one may say that some
adjectives undergo conversion to form a subclass of manner adverbs.
     3 .47     An   ben an       bi      suk    i   ne      ndo.
               3SG do      3SG poss thing       own DEf     good
               He does his things well .
     3.48      An   it     san     ndo     sepatu ndo.
               3 sG wear clothes good shoes good
               He was wearing good clothes and good shoes.
    Manner adverbs consist of a small group of adjectives (about 1 2) that do double duty as
adjectives and manner adverbs such as ndo 'good/well', ibit 'bad/badly ' , nggi
'strong/strongly' , at 'sharp/sharply ' . In addition there is another group, that behaves only as
adverbs, including kekro 'quickly', pare 'slowly' and a reduplicated form3, nyip-nyap
'finely crushed' . All manner adverbs are distinguished distributionally in that they fall outside
the noun phrase or possessive phrase, directly following the determiner as seen in example
3 .47.
   'Degree' adverbs are a small closed subclass of adverbs which modify manner adverbs as
well as adjectives. Distributionally, they always directly follow an adjective or an adverb.
There are two adverbs in this subclass, teker ' very/too' and wai ' more than/passing' as seen
in examples 3 .49 and 3.50 below.
     3.49      An    nuk    ye      teker.
               3 sG speak people INf
               She spoke (about) people too much.
     3.50      An     bes an nggwa kok wai are.
               3SG lift 3SG body           high INf complete
               He lifted up (exalted) himself as the highest.","[48, 49, 50]"

5.2. 1 NOUN PHRASE MOOIFlERS
   All modifiers in noun phrases are posthead. They occur after the head and before any
determiner which may appear. Such modifiers may consist of members from each of the
following classes of words or phrases :
other nouns
              adjectival phrase, consisting of adjectives such as colour (black, white), size (big,
              small) or quality (hard, soft), followed by an optional intensifier
              quantifier phrase, optionally preceded by a classifier, with quantifiers:
                      general (many, few, some)
                      cardinal numerals (one, two . . . )
                      ordinal numerals (first, second)
PHRASE STRUCIVRE                                                                             69   These modifiers appear in the noun phrase in the following order:                   (OTHER NOUN) (ADJECTIVAL PHRASE) (QUANTIFIER PHRASE)
   For example:
   5.16      nok         ku            sye      teke r koi   bok       yo
             wild.pig flesh       big    !NT     CL          several   DET
             Head       Noun Adj Phrase Class                Quant     Det
             several very big pieces of wild pig meat
   A noun phrase of the type gi ven in the example above, although acceptable to an Abun
speaker, is rather ' heavy' . By that we mean normally they would not include as many
modifiers together in this way. In order to retain the modification in a more natural style,
various strategies are employed to limit the number of modifiers in any one noun phrase.
These are discussed later in this section .
   Each modifier type will now be discussed with further examples.
   Other nouns may modify the head of a noun phrase. Thjs type of construction is usually
referred to as a complex noun phrase, but since the addition of another noun following the
head modifies the head analogous to other modifiers, we have chosen to discuss it as a
modifier. Examples of this type are:
   5.17      nggwe     jamsem           ne
             garden cassava             DET
             the cassava garden
   5.18      mbre             toha       sak     gri
             eastern.cloth toba CL               three
             three lengths of toba cloth
   The use of adjectival phrases as modifiers of the heads of noun phrases is by far the
most common type of modification. In most cases an adjectival phrase is realised by a single
adjective only, such as colour as in example 5 . 19, size 5.20, and quality 5 .2 1 . This type of
modification follows any other nouns that modify the head of the noun phrase. For more
complex examples of adjectival phrases see §5.5.
   5.19      Ye        gu     minda           kri.
             people    kill butterfly yellow
             They killed yellow butterflies.
  5 .20      os     nggwot        ne
             path narrow     DET
             the narrow path
  5.21       os    wit      yo
             way bad        DET
             a bad way
  Quantifier phrases may have either a general quantifier, an ordinal numeral or a cardinal
numeral as its head, and is preceded by an optional classifier when the head is a general
quantifier or an ordinal numeral, and an obligatory classifier when the head is a cardinal
numeral. See §5.6 for a discussion of quantifier phrases. Some examples are:
70                                                                                 CHAPTER 5     5 .22      Nggon (ge) m wa rna.
                woman CL   many come
                Many women came.

                His house is the third one.
     5.24       Ji ku          ndar       sye ge at.
                1 sG meet    dog    big       CL four
                I found four big dogs.
   There are limitations concerning modifiers within an Abun noun phrase. There are, of
course, semantic restrictions as to which modifiers may co-occur with others, and moreover,
there is pressure to limit the number of modifiers, so that the maximum noun phrase will
normally include only one of each type of modifier. Thus a noun phrase with two adjectives
is unacceptable. If a speaker desires to say something like 'two big white dogs ' , which
involves two adjectives, it is unacceptable to the Abun speaker to use the expression found in
example 5.25; rather, relativisation is usually employed, as in 5.26a, and 5 .26b.
     5.25        *ndar kwo       sye       ge    we
                dog     white big          CL    two
                two big white dogs
     5 .26 a.   ndar kwo        ge w e          gato   sye
                dog white CL two REL                   big
                1 . two white dogs that are big

             b. ndar sye ge           w e gato          kwo
                dog big body two REL                    white
                1 . two big dogs that are white
                2. two big white dogs
   One may posit that the relative clause modifies the noun phrase as a whole since it follows
the determiner, as seen in example 5.27 below. (See further discussion in §5.2.3.)
     5 .27      suk     wakgan       yo     gata men mbrinket
                thing small       DET REL 1 PL forget
                1 . some small things that we forgot
                2. some small forgotten things
   Alternatively, the speaker may frequently also juxtapose one of the adjectives in the form
of an appositional verbless clause, as seen in example 5.28. This type of modification is more
typical when the noun phrase fi lls the object position. In this case the modification is
syntactically outside the noun phrase; it is like a parenthetical comment.
     5.28       ndar kwo        ge         we,    ndar ne       sye

   There are five distinct types of detenniners used in Abun noun phrases. The first type is
the unspecific/specific distinction. The others are: deictics, anaphoric referents (which refer to
a previously mentioned person/thing), external referents (which refer to the proximity of an
item in relation to the speaker), and reflexives. Both anaphoric and external referents may
compound with deictics. These particles occur in phrase-final position. Table 5.3 lists each
type and the relevant particles, each of which will be discussed in tum below.","[80, 81, 82, 83]"

4.4.2 PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES
   Prepositional phrases consist of dative, spacio-temporal, benefactive, manner, associative,
and instrumental phrases. Prepositional phrases fol low an object. When there is a dative
prepositional phrase, it usually precedes other prepositional phrases. The order amongst the
other types of phrases is somewhat fluid.
    The fol lowing examples illustrate the position of various types of phrases in the clause.
For more details regarding the types of prepositional phrases see §5.4. Several types of
phrases begin with a preposition su 'with ' ; for example, temporal phrases as in example
4. 1 8, associati ve phrases 4. 1 9, instrumental phrases 4.20 and 4.2 1 and manner phrases 4.22.

   Benefactive phrases begin with the preposition wa 'for' , as in example 4.23. Locative
phrases generally begin with the locative preposition mo 'at, in, on' in 4 . 1 8 , or can also begin
with ket 'along' , 4.24, bot 'about' , 4.25, or kadit 'from' as in 4.26. The preposition kadit is
also used to form temporal phrases, as in 4.27.

              SUBJECT    VffiB 'TFMroRAL
              I have done (that) all the time up until now.
   The position of prepositional phrases relative to each other is somewhat fluid as is
normally the case for adjuncts. However, in the corpus of data it is clear that there is a
preference for su (associative and instrumental) phrases to precede mo locative phrases.
   Of the adjuncts, temporal phrases more commonly precede the subject as in example
4.28, and they may be placed j ust like time adverbs illustrated in 4. 14 above.
     4.28     Su futmo y e            mu nai       su-git    mo    nggwe.

              At first people went to get food from the garden.
   Prepositional phrases can occur in series as in the case of locative phrases with the
prepositions bot, as in example 4.25 above, and mo 4.29.
     4.29     Yen      taru            mu mo nje           mo nden mo Syubun.

10.3. 1 MEANs OF IDENTIFYING TIlE COMPLEMENT CLAUSE IN ABUN
   Since this particular clause type contains no complementiser, what is the basis for
assuming that these are complement clauses? These clauses are without any type of marking
and lack some means of syntactic identification which could identify them as complements.
There is a type of complement termed 'paratactic' which does not use a complementiser.
These clauses are not subordinate but rather are considered as independent clauses capable of
standing on their own.24 All of the constituents which follow the predicates in examples
10.55 to 10.53 above have the structure of a simple Abun clause. For instance an jam mo j i
'she listens to (or obeys) me' from 1 0.50 and ye mwa maskwa yu 'many people were angry
with each other' from 1 0.52 are all good Abun clauses. It could be possible then to consider
these clauses as paratactic complements since they are capable of standing on their own as
independent clauses. Given that the complex sentences that contain these clauses are
unmarked to indicate embedding or subordination, what means can be used to identify them
as subordinate complement clauses, embedded within the larger sentence?
    Giv6n has listed several means by which complement clauses can be syntactically
encoded ( 1 990:538ff). These various means show some type of syntactic variation by which
it can be determined that the clause functions as an argument of a predicate. One such type of
syntactic evidence he terms 'predicate raising' which results in forms like 'let go' or 'make
eat' . Abun does not appear to have any of these forms. Another means is through case
marking of the subject of the complement verb. Since Abun is a language which lacks any
form of case marking, this is not a means through which a complement clause could be
marked. Another means again is that of a subordinating morpheme or complementiser.
Complement clause types with such a marker have been described earlier (in § 1O.2 above).
He lists one other means of encoding a clause as a complement clause, that of verb
morphology or finiteness. In these cases, the complement clause is usually reduced with the
verb not taking a subject and the verb morphology being distinct from that found in
24    See Noonan ( 1 985:59-60) for a discussion on this.
COMPLEMENT ClAUSES                                                                           1 79indicative clauses. Can this means of encoding a complement be used for Abun?              Does
Abun have an infinitive form of the verb?","[190, 191]"

3 .2 EsTABLISHING WORD CLASSES
   In this section the parts of speech appropriate for the Abun language will be defined after a
discussion of the basis upon which the distinctions are made.
    In establishing the parts-of-speech classification for the Abun language, grammatical
criteria have been employed, namely the word ' s distribution, its range of syntactic functions
and the morphological or syntactical categories for which it is specifiable. These criteria are
listed by Schachter ( 1 985 :3), who states they are not open to the objections of unclear
application that traditional definitions are.
   Once the types of word classes are established on the basis of grammatical criteria, they
are given a label that reflects their characteristics. For example, words that express actions,
processes and the like are called verbs. A label for a word class is decided upon after the
word class has been established.
MORPHOWGYAND WORD ClASSES                                                                  25   Honey ( 1 972: 277) makes the point that ""the object of the grammarian i s to establish
categories of words which are most efficient for enabling him to make the most
comprehensive and, at the same time, the simplest grammatical statements . . . "". Honey
developed systematic syntactic statements whereby he established his system of word classes
for Vietnamese (which is also an analytical language like Abun) on the basis of positional
relationships of certain selected words and/or classes of words. Some of his methods have
been applied in order to establish a set of word classes for Abun.
   The word classes in Abun have been divided into open and closed classes. Open classes
of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs have a membership that is in principle unlimi ted.
Closed classes, which in Abun are noun adjuncts, verb adjuncts, conj unctions, proforms,
particles and interjections, have a fixed and generally small number of words.","[36, 37]"

mentioned noun phrase which usually represents a group of undefined size. When either kwa
or do are used they refer to part of the previously mentioned whole. Kwa can only be used
with non-tangible referents (that is, nouns that cannot be counted or considered specific
items). For this reason it is best translated as 'part of' or 'some of' . Do can be used only with
specific or tangible referents.
   In the instance where the head of the relative clause is the noun suk 'thing/things' , this
noun merges with the relative clause conjunction to create a compound form. The final k is
lost so that the resultant form is sugato 'thing that/that which ' , as in examples 9 . 1 0 and 9. 1 1
below.","[159, 160]"

  The first detenniner type of specificity contrasts unknownlknown or unspecific/specific
and requires the use of the particles yo ' a, some' (for the former) and ne 'the' (for the latter).
The following examples illustrate each of these detenniners:
   5 .29       An     rem kwokwe bo yo.
               3SG    had egg. plant CL DEf
                She had some egg plants. (unspecific quantity)

   5.31        Nggon  ne   it      san     dik yo.
               woman DEf wear clothes one DEf
               The woman wore a dress. (known woman, unspecific dress)
   The second type of determiner, the deictic type, has the form re, ne or tu. These refer to
locational or temporal characteristics of the situation within which an utterance takes place. Ye
'person' in combination with each of these results in:
              ye re                this person (here)
              ye ne                that person (there)
              ye tu                those people (distant)
   There is a progression from close to near to distant in meaning from re to ne to tu. This
occurs not only in a locative sense, but also in a temporal sense, (recent, not-so-recent to
distant past) as well as in a referential sense, (re 'this (just previously referred to)"" ne 'that
72                                                                                       CHAPTER S                                    ,
(slightly further removed reference) and tu 'that (distant) (even further removed) ' ) . Each of
these senses is determined from the context.
   Examples of each of the deictics are below. The temporal meaning of now, or at some
other time is seen in examples 5 .32 and 5 .34; reference to Fredik (meaning the one we know
or can locate, as distinct from other Frediks) in 5.32; and locative meanings of the deictics,
'here' in 5.32, 'there' in 5.34 and 'distant' in 5.35 and 5 .36. See Table 3 . 1 0 in §3.4 for a list
of these and other determiner compounds.
     5.32     Su   re     Fredik re      kern rno-re            reo
              with DEI Fredik DEI lives LOC-DEf                 PERF
              Now this Fredik already lives here.

              1 PL say-about NOM-Speak            DEI
              We discussed that news.
     5 .34    Su    ne     nggon    ne     ben suk- ibit      rno-ne.
              with DEI woman DEI do NOM-bad                   LOC-DEI
              At that time, that woman did a bad thing there.
     5.35     Ye     ket-bot      nden tu.
              people way-along bush DEI
              They went along the distant bush (track).
     5.36     An w e ne     rnu rno banbo            tu    mrn.
              3sG two DEI go LOC mountain DEI east
              Those two went to the distant eastern mountain .
   The deictic, tu, can have the meaning 'respected' , rather than distant, in relation to
old/respected men or women , yenggras tu 'that old/respected man ' and nggongras tu 'that
old/respected women ' . The idea of respect also encompasses those who are more powerful,
as in the example of a killing party below:
     5 .37    Yeko          ne      kwop or               Yeko            tu
              killing.party DEI     die  completely       killing.party   DEf(respected)
              ana    rn u   gu     ye       ne     or            reo
              TOP    go     kill   people   DEI    completely    PERF
              That killing party died outright. The (other respectedlbetter) killing party were
              the ones who had killed those people outright.
   The third type of determiner is anaphoric referent. One particle, ga, is used to refer back
to a person or thing mentioned. This can be used to distinguish several people of the same
name who could be understood to be part of a story as in the following examples:
     5 .38    Ii sok-bot        Yohana gao
              lSG look-about Yohana ANA..
              I looked at Yohana (previously mentioned).
     5.39     Prisila ga sa.
              Prisila ANA.. laugh
              Prisila (previously mentioned) laughed.
PHRASE STRUCFURE                                                                          73   Or, when a person has been mentioned and the speaker wants to ensure that the hearers
understand that the pronoun, in example 5 .40 below, an '3sG ' , does actually mean the last
person mentioned, the anaphoric referent is added.
   5 .40     Ii s i      an ga      rnu rno nden.
             lsG with 3sG ANA. go LOC bush
             I together with him (previously mentioned) went to the bush.
   This anaphoric referent may then also be combined with the deictics, re, ne or tu to
produce the compounds gare, gane and gatu. (It i s on the basis of word-final stress
patterning that these forms are considered as compounds.) The difference between these three
compounds is the proximity of reference in the mind of the speaker. Those persons or things
that were mentioned are referred to by the use of gare 'this/these, just mentioned' as in
examples 5.4 1 and 5 .42; gane 'that/those, just mentioned' as in 5.43 and 5.44; and gatu

            distant past).
   The fourth type of determiner is to, the external referent. This particle refers to the
external setting where the utterance occurs and the proximity of the person or thing under
discussion to that place. When this particle occurs as a free form, it introduces additional
modifying phrases or clauses (see §5 .2.3). It may also compound with the deictic particles
re, ne and tu, and is used by a speaker who wants to make reference to something he/she is
touching while speaking; (tore in examples 5 .46 and 5 .47), or is pointing to while speaking,
(tone in 5 .48); or is pointing to in the distance (totu in 5 .49).

             The two women came to that mountain (speaker points to location in the
             distance).
   The final type of determiner is reflexives such as himself, yourself, and themselves. The
form dakai RFFlEXIVE is used for all persons and numbers and usually co-occurs with a
pronoun or person ' s name, as seen in examples 5.50 and 5.5 1 , but also co-occurs with nouns
modified by quantifiers 5.52.
     5.50    Yemina dakai kon Barbarina wzp ne                 sor.
             lsG     REA..    cook B arbarina      sore DEf just
             Just Yemina herself cared for B arbarina' s sore.
     5.51    Men i-wa        men dakai ki-bot             men         dakai.
             1 PL happy-TRs 1 PL REA.. speak-about 1 PL               REA..
             We ourselves wanted to talk about ourselves.
     5.52    Nggon ge gri       dakai mu.
             woman CL three REA..       go
             The three women themselves went.
   In addition, the form wadigan 'alone' is reflexive, meaning 'by himself/alone' , 'by
itself/alone' , 'by themselves/alone' and so on, as in the examples below:
     5.53    sugit suge       wadigan
             food animal alone
             1 . meat by itself
             2. meat alone
             3. only meat
     5.54    mbre            sye wadigan
             antique.cloth big alone
             valuable antique cloth alone
   This form implies separateness from other people or things, while dakai implies a
distinctiveness from other people. So in example 5.55, Isak was by himself rowing the
canoe; no-one else was present. Whereas if dakai replaced wadigan, the implication is that
Isak as distinct from the others rowed the canoe; that is, there could have been others with
him in the canoe.
     5 .55   Isak wadigan mbros kwem.
             Isak alone          row     canoe
             1 . Isak rowed the canoe by himself.
             2. Isak alone rowed the canoe.

   There are other ways to modify a noun phrase apart from using the modifiers discussed
above. Phrases or clauses may be added to a noun phrase by the use of to NOUN MODIFYlNG
PARTICLE, or by the juxtaposition of locative prepositional phrases (in order to modify the head
of the noun phrase in regard to its location). A special case, sino 'all together' , is also
discussed at the end of this section.
   In these instances an Abun noun phrase consists of:                       HEAD (MODIFlERS) (DETERMINER) (MODIFIERS)
   Usually only one modifier fol lows the determiner, but more than one is possible as in
example 5 .68 below.
   The noun modifying particle (NMP) introduces a phrase or clause which modifies the head
of a noun phrase. Phrases and clauses introduced by NMP are added to the noun phrase and
modify it. Consider the following example:
   5.56      Wo suk-fo       to         ndam    syor             ne    yo,        nu-we
             but thing-taboo NMP        bird    cassowary        DEr   then.1RR   2PL-two
             git nde.
             eat NEG
             B ut the cassowary is taboo, you must not eat it.
   The phrase 'the cassowary ' , introduced by the NMP, modifies the forbidden thing. Again in
example 5.57 below, the noun banbo ' mountain' is modified by the addition of the phrase
'the Waibe' .
   5.57     M e n gwa b e i yamo banbo           to     Waibe n e d e rut.
            I PL beat sago at        mountain NMP Waibe DEr side far
            We beat the sago on the mountain, that is on Waibe mountain on the far side.
  The NMP also joins unrestrictive relative clauses to a noun phrase in order to modify a
noun, as seen in the following example:
   5.58     A n k i nai      Martinus    to-re      to      kra   Domingas
            3SG say to       Martinus    EXT-this   REI..   marry Domingas
            ne bi      ai     gum do Simam Yorfen do. . .
            DEr POSS father name COM Si mam Yorfen COM
            He said to Marti nus' father (the Martinus who lives here, who married
            Domingas) (whose) name was Simam Yorfen that. . .
   When sa ' like, as' compounds with to, the compound form sato 'for example/such as'
results. The use of this form precedes complex noun phrases which are added to modify or
explain the head of the noun phrase, as seen in the example below. (See §5.7 for more details
on complex noun phrases.)
76                                                                                        CHAPTER 5
     5.59    Regina    ben siri        su pa         yesok     sato           Arnol    e
             Regina    do  wrong       with child    youth     such.as        Amol     and
             Lambertus e.
             Lambertus  and
             Regina committed adultery with (some) young men such as Arnol and
             Lambertus.
   Furthermore the anaphoric referent ga also compounds with to and forms gato, the
relative conjunction, which is used to form restrictive relative clauses. Examples show how
these forms modify the nouns in the phrases below. Note that the form ne ' DET' is frequently
a relative clause boundary marker, as distinct from the same form used as a determiner in the
noun phrase.
     5.60    Suk-jan       gato an jan           mo nggwe        ne      bere    teo
             NOM-plant RB...      3PL plant LOC garden           DEY     later   die
             Plants that they plant in that garden will die.
     5.61    Men mu de        syur mo syur wak gato nje                                ben  ne.
             I PL go    go.in water LOC water hole          RB... people               make DET
             We went and washed at the well that people had made.
     5.62    Yenggras gato Mauren gato kwop re          anato mao
             elder     RB... Mauren RB... die  recently FOC     come
             The elder whose (name was) Mauren who died recently was the one who
             came.
   Such clauses also modify the head of a noun phrase, and are one possible option where
the speakers desire to include more than one adjectival type of modification to a noun phrase
as explained in § 5 .2 . 1 above. For more details regarding restrictive and unrestrictive relative
clauses, see §9.
    A locative prepositional phrase frequently modifies the head of a noun phrase, as in the
following examples. The clothes spoken of in example 5.63 are 'clothes at the sea' which
modifies the noun, clothes. The resulting meaning is modem clothes as distinct from 'clothes
in the bush' (the traditional bark cloth worn in the bush).
     5 .63   san     mo sem ne
             clothes LOC sea       DEY
             modem clothes ('sea' clothes cf. 'bush ' clothes)
   Other locative prepositional phrases modify the noun by indicating its location. Thus it is
clear in example 5 .64 which garden and in 5 .65 and 5.66 which people are being spoken
about.
     5 .64   mo nggwe mo banbo                  to-tu                  nim
             LOC garden LOC mountain EXT-there(distant)                east
             at the garden on the distant eastern mountain
     5 .65   Nin mo Fe! rna           rno Syurur Sye.
             2PL LOC Fef came LOC Syurur Sye
             1 . You Fef (people) come to Syurur Sye.
             2. You in Fef come to Syurur Sye.

             Many people in the house fought each other.
   Finally, there is a special modifier that occurs after determiners: sino 'alVtogether' . Sino is
always the final constituent of a noun phrase whenever it occurs as seen in examples 5.67
and 5 .68. It modifies the whole phrase in a similar way to relative clauses. This is similar
also to English where 'all' modifies the whole noun phrase as in 'all the Icing ' s men . . . ' .
   5 .67     yenggras mwa n e         sino
             old. men many DET all
             all the many old respected men
   5 .68     ye- wis            yi     ga     mo bur re         sino
             person-family other Ra LOC land this               all
             all the other tribes which are in this land
   This modifier is out of character with all the other single-word modifiers in that it follows
the determiner. It could be that it was originally a phrase (si no 'with completeness' ) that has
compounded to form the single word. In that case sino would be considered as a noun
phrase itself and the whole utterance would be considered as two noun phrases conjoined,
with si no being the second noun phrase. For further discussion of complex phrases see

  Apart from the conjunction sa, this temporal relationship can be indicated by the time
word sugane 'at that time/then' which occurs in 1 1 . 1 8.
1 1 .2. 1 .5 sa- READS 'CONDmONAL'
   The conjunction sa is most commonly used as a general temporal subordinator as
described above and as such would best be translated into English as 'when ' . However, sa
can also be extended in its meaning to include the semantic concept of condition and also to
include subjunctive modality. Longacre ( 1 985 :265), in describing clause-chaining languages,
states that ""Temporal relations appear to be central in these languages and are extended
metaphorically in other directions."" Certainly in regard to the conjunction sa, which normally
functions as a temporal subordinating conjunction, its usage can be extended to include the
notion of condition. Abun has no single lexical item that could be translated as 'if' . There are
a number of ways that the semantic concept of 'condition' is conveyed in Abun. One of
them is by means of the conjunction sa used together with the time words be/bere
'later/will/future' . When the second clause of the complex sentence containing sa is marked
by be/bere, the sentence has the same meaning as a conditional sentence and can be
translated as 'if. ..then ' . Also in some cases these sentences could be translated in a way that
could be considered as 'subjunctive' . 3 6 Because sa is a conjunction which conveys time
setting or 'tense ' , these sentences, although referring to hypothetical events, must be marked
as being in the past. It could be stated that a past tense or realis 'conditional' conjunction is a
35    The fact that Abun grammar can mark the temporal notion of simultaneity in three overt ways, by
      the conjunctions sa and saresa and by the clitic -i, indicates the grammatical importance of this
      notion.
36    The notions often termed 'subjunctive' are more emphatically conveyed by the compound
      conjunction sane-sa 'had that been the case ' . This conjunction is discussed in the following
      chapter, § 1 2.5.

conditional by means of a morpheme, other strategies are used to convey this notion. One
means is by the combination sa + be which results in a conditional sentence in a past or
realis time setting.

12.5 INflUENCE OF THE NATIONAL LANGUAGE ON ABUN COMPlEX SENTENCE SlRUcruRE
   Over recent years a growing number of Abun speakers have become bilingual and speak
the national language, B ahasa Indonesia. However, the number of those who are reasonably
fluent is still smal l. This means that the influence of Bahasa Indonesia on Abun complex
sentence structure is not yet great. Abun complex sentences differ quite markedly from
Indonesian complex sentences. There are also several conj unctions in Indonesian which have
no Abun counterpart. The most common of these are kalau 'if' , sebelum 'before' and atau
'or' . Some Abun speakers add these Indonesian words alongside the existing Abun form.
As yet these are not used to replace the Abun forms which represent these concepts.
   The Indonesian language has, in a small way, influenced the structure of the Abun
complex sentence. All Abun conjunctions are sentence-medial so that sentence structure is as
follows (constituency aside):
                                 CLAUSE 1 + CONJUNCTION + CLAUSE 2
  However, there are Indonesian conjunctions which are sentence-initial. These sentences
have the following structure:
                                 CONJUNCTION + CLAUSE 1 + CLAUSE 2
   This pattern has influenced Abun sentence structure in two cases. The first is with the
concessive conjunction kap-re 'although ' . The second is with the logical conj unction sane
'so' .
(i) kap-re 'although'
   Kap-re is actually a noun phrase meaning 'this (period of) time ' . Kap 'time (unspecified) '
is an older word which is infrequently used. It survives as a variant of 'when
(INTERROGATIVE)' , kap u ? 'when?' . The other variant is kam u ? 'day which/when ?'. Kapre
has come to be used as a conjunction meaning 'although/even though' . Of the existing Abun
conjunctions there is none that has the equivalent meaning of 'although' .4 3 Indonesian,
however, is a language which strongly marks the semantic notion of concession. There are a
number of forms which can be used including meskipun 'although ' , walaupun 'although'
and also sungguhpun and sekalipun. Therefore it appears that the Abun temporal phrase kap­
re has undergone a category change. In doing so, it fi lls a semantic concept which is strongly
marked in the national language, but was not explicitly marked in Abun.",[229]

     5 . 1 77    Apner, Fredik si     Musa git sugit.
                 Apner Fredik with Musa eat food
                 Apner, Fredik and Musa ate food (together).
  The former type is more emphatic than the latter in much the same way as in English
where 'and' can be repeated, as illustrated in the second translation of example 5 . 1 76 above.
    A slightly hybrid version of these two types is seen in example 5 . 178 below. This is due
to the use of the first person sentence-initially. In Abun, the first person is mentioned first in
a list of persons; that is, an Abun speaker normally refers to himself first.
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                               97   5. l78     Ii si     Adolof Senderina        Erlendsi     Yususina      si

              Yususina and with Mrs Barbarina.
     It should be noted that it is possible for the conj uncts to be split around the predicate to
form: NP PRFD si NP, where the second phrase could be analysed as a si (associative)
prepositional phrase (discussed in §5.4.3). Note that the meaning of both examples 5 . 1 77 and
5 . 1 79 is simil ar; however, the former construction is much more common. (payne
1 985a:32) indicates that this split of conjuncts occurs in other languages, such as Russian.
   5 . 1 79   Apner git sugit       si      Fredik s i   Musa.
              Apner eat food        with Fredik with Musa
              Apner ate food together with Fredik and Musa.
   The 'with' strategy is not only used for joining phrases where the head is a name or a
pronoun, but also where the head is another type of noun, a noun phrase or a possessive
phrase, such as in the following examples:
   5 . 1 80   Suk     sato sukom          si    bok     si    barisyan an gil          sore.

              Rachel and her mother and father had already gone.
   The 'with ' strategy i s limited to the conjoining of noun phrases and, in some rare cases, in
the joining of clauses with a common subject. The following example, where two clauses are
joined, comes from a text where the speaker is giving advice on what children with diarrhea
should not do.
   5 . 1 83   Pa     da       gur       bo dek       rom      si     gil i-ka    nde.
              child drink coconut CL young liquid with eat its-flesh NEG
              1 . Children must not drink young coconut mil k together with eating its flesh.
              2. Don ' t drink young coconut mi lk and eat its flesh.
   There appears to be no limit to how many phrases can be joined by si 'with' (or e 'and' ).
One recorded example has a list of nine places that Isak pointed out to the author of the story:
""Isak kadum Iokya, Syugai, Syurgwem, Syukwo, Somsibo, Weyos, Bangkui, Bangkwau s i
Wai is ji"". This utterance used the pause much like English and concluded with si 'with'
before the final place name.
  The use of the 'with ' strategy is more common with coordinate phrases in subject
position. This is because subjects are mostly agents. On the other hand, use of e is more
98                                                                                       CHAPTER 5
common with coordinate phrases in object position, although there are exceptions as seen in
example 5 . 1 73 .
   Semantically there are some restrictions on the use o f the 'with' strategy. The conjuncts
must be seen as acting together, as in example 5 . 1 82 where Rachel and her parents went
together. If they went separately, the speaker would use the 'and' strategy . Also, to employ
the 'with' strategy, the conjuncts could be seen as being located close together. Thus in 5 . 1 8 1 ,
the island and Syunsom were seen together or pointed out together, and so si was used. Also
in 5 . 1 80, the items spoken about are of the same type, in the sense that vegetables are eaten
together with either or both of salt and chilli. If, however, these items were in a list and not
necessaril y eaten together then e would be used, as in 5 . 1 74, where different food items that
would not be eaten together are listed.
   There are times when si and not e must be used. In example 5 . 1 84, the use of si means
that the clothes mentioned are actually in the bags. If the clothes were separate from the bags
then e would be more appropriate than si. The use of si therefore implies a togetherness
much more so than the use of e.
     5 . 1 84   Pa    pe      yu si         san      e     sukrnwa       ne.
                child carry bag with clothes and many.things DEY
                The children carried the bags with clothes and the many (other) things.
   In example 5 . 1 85 , for example, Apner, Markus and RK are not together when the speaker
refers to them. They are in different locations and are being spoken about at different points
in time. Therefore since there is no 'togetherness ' , e is more appropriate.
     5 . 1 85   An nuk            Apner e       Markus         e     RK    e.
                3sG spoke.about Apner and Markus               and   RK    and
                She spoke about Apner, Markus and RK.
   In summary, of the three strategies used for conjunction, namely j uxtaposition, 'and' and
'with' , there is a strengthening of coordination from one to the next; that is, the first is more a
general grouping of items, while the last is more a specific linking of items.","[108, 109, 110]"

8.S 1HE SCOPEOF NEGATION
   Klima ( 1 964), Reesink ( 1986) and Payne ( 1 98Sb) discuss the scope of negation in terms
of 'constituent' and 'sentential ' . The negation of words or phrases may be called 'constituent
negation' , while the negation of predicates, sentences and more complex sentences has
traditionally been called 'sentential negation ' . These two terms were coined initially in relation
to English. In the sentence, 'John is unhappy' , the negation is defined as 'constituent'
because the negation operates on one part (or constituent) of the sentence; while in 'John is
not happy' , the type of negation is defined as 'sentential ' .
   I n Abun the scope o f negation i s usually sentential (or, more precisely, the negation o f the
predicate) and this is syntactically marked by use of the linked pair of negative particles
(§8.S . I ). Take, for example, the sentence in example 8.33, a simple negative indicative
sentence where the two negative particles surround the predicate. In this case, the action
(killing), the object (the wild pig) or the location (by the Nai river) all fall within the scope of
negation. The subject (Isak), however, does not fall within the scope of negation here because
subjects are usually contextually bound.
142                                                                                      CHAPTER 8   8.33      Isak yo       gu     nok         mo   syur    Nai de         nde.
             Isak NEG      kill wild. pig LOC water Nai           bank    NEG
              Isak did not kill a wild pig by the Nai river.
   As to which constituent is actually being negated in the mind of the speaker would in most
cases be clear from the context, but there are syntactic strategies by which the scope of
negation can be narrowed to focus on one constituent. This is discussed in § 8 .S.2.","[153, 154]"
"
3.3.2.4 NOUN COMPOUNDS AND THE i- PREFIX
    After the initial reference to a 'whole-part' type noun in a discourse, further reference can
be made to the item by replacing the morpheme representing the whole with the prefix, i- .
Therefore, after an initial reference to kwenat, additional reference to that item later in the
discourse is made by using the prefix i- as a pronominal referent, and so the form would be
i-nat 'its-leaves ' . Likewise with the other types of whole-part relationships, ndam-go
becomes i-go 'its-feathers' , wo-dar becomes i-dar 'its-scales' and yor-ot becomes i-ot 'its­
tip ' . In such words both morphemes are bound.
   In human whole-part relationships or inalienable possession, the prefix i- is not used,
rather the person ' s name or person pronoun is used, for example Musa syim ' Musa ' s
arm/hand' , ji syim ' m y arm/hand' , an gwes 'his/her leg'. The possessive pronoun for
human inalienable possession is the same as the subject and object pronoun for each person.
Furthermore, the body part (syim, 'arm', gwes ' leg' etc.) may occur as a free form and is not
a bound morpheme, as is the case of the 'part' in non-human whole-part relationships.
Therefore, the prefix i- is only used as an inalienable possessive pronoun prefix for non-

pronoun replaces a noun.","[46, 47]"

10.2.5.2 SYNTACTIC RESTRICTIONS
   Since the predicates 'want' and 'believe' cannot allow negative raIsmg due to lexical
restrictions, the only other predicate eligible for negative raising in Abun would be nut
'think' . Examples of negative raising with this predicate are not found in Abun. The
following examples show a complement clause containing a negative as in example 10.46
and then an unacceptable sentence where this negative has been 'raised' in 10.47.
     1 0.46    Ii nut do ji           yo ku        nan gro 0    nde.
               Is think CDM I so NEG meet 2so eye again NEG
               I thought that I would not see you (ever) again.
     1 0.47     *Ii yo        nut     do ji       ku     nan gro            0        nde.
                I so NEG think CX)M I so meet 2so eye                       again    NEG
                I did not think that I would (ever) see you again.
   Example 1 0.47 is unacceptable on syntactic grounds. Negative sentences in Abun are
formed by two negative particles rather than only one. The dual negative particles that are
21    I n § 1 2. 1 i t i s shown that Abun prepositions not only link phrases to clauses but also link embedded
      clauses.
1 76                                                                                 CHAPTER 10used in Abun must bracket or enclose the entire verb phrase (in transformational grammar
terms) or predicate (in traditional grammar terms, meaning all the constituents that follow the
subject). Because of this, any subordinate clause that is under the matrix clause is always
included within the grammatical scope of the negation. This means that although it is the verb
of the matrix clause that is being negated, the final negative particle will not occur until after
the subordinate clause. The following example illustrates this, where the subordinate clause is
of the relative type, with the negative particle nde actually occurring after the relative clause
without negating the relative clause itself.
   l O.48    A n yo    ki     su-gato ibit subot nan          ma      nde.
             3PL NEG say thing-REL bad about           2so    exist NEG
             They did not say anything that was bad about you at all.
   In order for negative raising to take place as has been attempted in example l O.47 , only
one negative particle, -yo-, will move in order to negate the matrix verb nut 'think' . Due to
the structure and word order of complex negative constructions in Abun it is not possible to
shift the second negative particle nde and retain a grammatical sentence. Abun rules of word
order do not allow this. Normally in languages that allow negative raising the means of
negation is syntactically removed from the subordinate clause and 'raised' into the main
clause. Because Abun negation involves the use of two particles, both of these cannot be
'raised' from the complement clause. This structural limitation shows that negative raising is
not possible in Abun.
lO.3 EMBEDDED COMPLEMENTS
   The second type of complement to be found in Abun does not make use of the
complementiser. For want of a better label we have called these complements 'embedded' .
There are mainly two types of predicate which do not need to have a complementiser: those
which involve desiderative or attitudinal predicates and those which involve some type of
force, that is a manipulative predicate. These semantic distinctions are illustrated by the type
of verb suffix used. Attitudinal predicates make use of the suffix -wa, while those indicating
some sort of force or pressure (manipulative) use -gat. Examples of these verb types which
do not use a complementiser are fwa 'want' , bariwa 'not.want/dislike', nyuwa 'fear' and
nokwa 'worry about' , all being attitudinal predicates, and wergat 'persuade/pressurise' and
krokgat 'annoy/stir up' being manipulative predicates. Other manipulative predicates will be
discussed later in the chapter.
   The following examples illustrate these complement types:
   10.49     A n i-wa       ji     jam     mo an          sor.
             3so happy-TRS I so listen to         3so     only
             She wanted me to listen only to her.
   lO.50     An    bari-wa         an jam mo            ji.
             3so not.want-TRS 3so listen to             3so
             She did not want to listen to me.
   lO.5 1    Ii nok-wa       an maskwa ji.
             I so worry-TRs 3so angry        I so
             I was worried she (would be) angry (with) me.

                 We do not force other tribes to do these things.
   In other languages, besides Abun, a different predicate type can mean a different
complement type. For instance Givan ( 1 990:553) states that it is ""more common to find
subordinating morphemes in complements of cognition-utterance verbs, as compared with
manipulative or modality verbs"". Givan' s categories roughly compare to the Abun
categories described above. All Abun utterance predicates use the complementiser (his
'subordinating morpheme' ) when the complement is intended to refer to direct spe�ch.22
His 'modality' predicates include the verb 'want' , which is under discussion here, and also
other verbs which are not in the class of verbs for Abun . 2 3 In English, attitudinal and
manipulative predicates are distinguished by having a complement of an infinitival structure.
Utterance predicates have complements which use a subordinating conjunction 'that'. Givan
further distinguished predicates (such as English 'want' and the manipulative predicate
'order') in that the infinitival complements of these verbs could not tolerate further embedded
clauses such as relative clauses and clefts ( 1 993:68). In Abun, these predicates likewise take
complements that are structurally quite different from the 'utterance predicates' and others
described in § 1O.2 above. The manipulative predicate ben 'make' , discussed later, does not
take a complementiser. A predicate such as let does not have a distinct lexical form in Abun
and is always rendered as fwa 'happy to' . Likewise the predicate oswa 'help' , although not
a desiderative predicate, makes use of the suffix -wa to indicate an embedded complement
clause. For example:
     10.54       Sane Markus os-wa duno an.
                 so   Markus help teach 3sG
                 So Markus helped to teach her.
   Besides not taking the complementiser do these complement types are structurally
different in another important way. These complement types function as the object of the
main clause. On the other hand those which use a complementiser do not, as was shown in
§ 10.2 .4 earlier. The complement clauses of § 10.2 were described as fitting into Abun
sentence structure in the following way:
              SUBJECT + VERB + (OBJECT) + (INDIRECT OBJECT) + (do) + (COMPLEMENT CLAUSE)
  The complement clause types under discussion here are structurally quite different. These
complement clauses function as the object and so the sentence has the following structure:
                                         SUBJECf + VERB + OBJECT
22    One predicate kendo 'call' does not use the complementiser if the complement does not represent
      direct speech. This distinction will be looked at further in § 10.3.3
23    These include 'start' , 'finish' and 'try' which are all adverbs in Abun, namely sim 'just started' or
      'finished/completely' bergan 'almost ' .
178                                                                                 CHAPTER 10   Earlier, example 1 0.40 above was shown in such a way that its constituent structure was
fully described. If example 1 0.49 is repeated in the same way the structural difference
between the complement types is clearer:
     10.55       An               twa          ji          jam     mo     an      sor.
       3sG              want         1 sG         listen to      3sG    only
       Subject          Verb                 Object (Complement Clause)
      She wanted me to only listen to her.
  What evidence is there to support this analysis that, when no complementiser is used the
complement clause is actually the object of the main clause rather than an additional
constituent within it? There are actually two points at issue here. Firstly, clauses like ji jam
mo an sor from example 10.55 above are actually full clauses and as such they are
complement clauses embedded in a larger structure, rather than being separate assertions.
Secondly, these clauses represent the object of the main clause in which they are embedded.
Each of these points will be looked at in tum.","[187, 188, 189, 190]"
"
3      Reduplicated forms occur in Abun but number less than ten. There are some verbs like rup-rek
       'twinkle' , fot-fat 'break' and a noun, lIlok-muk 'body' .

   The closed classes in Abun are distinguished on the basis of syntax; for example,
pronouns (together with proper nouns) may be directly followed by the possessive linker hi,
predicate markers always directly precede a verb or predicate adjective, prepositions always
precede their noun, and particles, except the topicaliser, are always sentence-final.","[50, 51]"

10.4.2 UTIERANCE PREDICATES
  There is only one utterance predicate, kendo 'call' which exhjbits these two structural
possibilities. Example 10.77 below earlier appeared as example 10.8.

  Another predicate that i s similar is the pretence predicate kidar 'lie/trick/deceive ' .
Example 1 0.79 appeared earlier as example 10. 19.
     1 0.79     An     kidar nje         do        an     yewon.
                3sG lie       people COM 3SG shaman

                Erensi deceive child DEf go
                Erensi deceived the child into going (away).
     It appears that only a small number of predicates may behave this way, exhibiting two
distinct structural possibilities. As the above examples illustrate, there appear to be certain
restrictions which limit the number of predicates capable of doing this. One restriction limits
predicates to those that are transitive. Any intransitive verb can occur only with the
complementiser present. The second restriction appears to be one of co-referentiality. Givan
( 1 993: 1 5) describes the sharing of referents across contiguous clauses and tenns this
'referential continuity' . In describing co-reference limitations for English complement
clauses he notes ( 1 993 : 1 6) that ""The subject of the complement of a modality verb must be
co-referential with the subject of the main verb and the subject of the complement of a
manipulative verb must be co-referential with the object of the main verb"" [italics his]. In
Abun, co-reference restrictions also apply but are somewhat different to those which Givan
has described for English. In Abun, if these predicates can take both an object and
complement constituent then there needs to be agreement between the object and the
complement constituent. In three of the above examples, 1 0.73, 1 0.75 and 1 0.77, the object
of the predicate is co-referential with the subject of the complement clause. In all of these
cases the subject of the complement clause is replaced by a pronoun which agrees in number
and person with the object of the matrix clause. However, example 1 0.79 shows a pretence
predicate which varies in that the subject of the complement clause agrees with the subject of
the main clause predicate. Here again a pronoun is used to indicate agreement. The means of
pronominal reference to the subject of the complement clause is typical of all cases where
these two constituents are co-referential. Unlike English, where only in manipulative
predicates does the object of the predicate agree with the subject of the complement, as
shown in Table 10. 1 , this restriction is shared by other predicate types. 29 Therefore it appears
that if a particular predicate can take complements both with and without a complementiser
then co-reference restrictions operate.","[199, 200]"
"
39    It could be said that on this basis Abun does possess a subordinate/coordinate distinction of clause
      types. We have preferred not to incorporate this distinction within our analysis because as pointed
      out at the beginning of Chapter 1 1 there is little syntactic marking to distinguish the two types.
      Rather we have preferred to distinguish the other syntactic feature that these conjunctions possess,
      namely the ability to compound and create new forms.

   The third conjunction that is included in the group of compounding conjunctions is the
sequential conjunction te 'then ' . Abun has no single conjunction which in meaning i s
precisely equivalent to a coordinate conjunction such a s the English 'and ' . However, t e and
its dialect variant ge in compound form produce a number of varying sequential
conjunctions. It has been observed (Longacre 1985 :267) that the notions of temporal
simultaneity and sequence ""are elaborated with considerable range and variety in Papua New
Guinea"". The number of sequential variants found in Abun is typical of a Papuan language
and shows something of the influence of these languages on Abun syntax. It may be
uncommon to group sequential conjunctions together with those conjunctions meaning
'because' and 'but'. However, there are no syntactic distinctions found in Abun complex
sentences which correlate with the semantic differences of these conjunctions and which
would justify a further subdivision. Another type of conjunction, (that which means
'alternation' , such as the English 'or' ) is also normal ly considered together with a
conjunction of contrast such as wo 'but' . Abun has no single morpheme which i s used to
indicate alternation. 40 Therefore for Abun, on the basis of common syntactic behaviour,
sequential conjunctions are included within the second group of prepositional
conjunctions-the 'compounding' conjunctions. Examples of sentences containing te and its
variant ge are given below:
     1 2.28   Men kem sane                  wade jam            dik        bayok,     te     men
               1 PL    stay like.that       until     hour      one        perhaps    then   1 PL
              jam      kapar-ok uk.
              hear ship-fly make.noise
              We stayed there for about an hour, then we heard the noise of the plane.
     1 2.29   An maskwa ge        an    gu     an    bi   nggon kam-dik kam-dik.
              3sG angry     then 3sG beat 3sG POSS woman day-one day-one
              He was angry then he beat his wife every day.
   Given that these examples differ significantly from those normally described as
'subordinate' or 'coordinate', is a third option available? For example, is it possible to40    This is a feature marked on each clause which may represent a choice to the hearer. In
      interrogatives bado is used. Otherwise the temporal subordinate conjunction yo is used, or the
      particle ka, a borrowed term from the unrelated Biak language.
PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCllONS                                                           21 1consider these sentences as 'cosubordinate' in the same way that Foley and Van Valin apply
 this term to various clause types that are found in the clause-chaining languages of Papua
New Guinea and elsewhere? They describe their usage of the term 'cosubordinate' in the
following way (Foley & Van Valin 1984:257): ""a dependency relation exists between the
j uncts in that they must have the same illocutionary force and share the same absolute tense"".
This is not the case for Abun where, as illustrated in example 1 2.24 above, the imperative
mood is marked only on the first clause and the second clause i s marked by an aspect
marker.4 1 In fact the Abun sentences described here fit more closely Foley and Van Valin' s
definition o f coordination, although they (Foley & Van Valin 1 984:243) admit that they do
not use this term in the 'traditional ' sense:
      Coordinate nexus applies to any construction in which the j uncts are not in a part­
      whole relationship i.e. one junct is not embedded in the other and both juncts
      may be independently specified for the operators at the given level of j uncture.","[221, 222, 223]"
"   The form bot has in many cases become combined with verbs. The resultant forms have a
different semantic scope when compared to the uninflected forms, for example wat
'separate' and watbot 'examine' in examples 3.17 and 3. 1 8 . The uninflected wat means
'separate' , while watbot contains the perlative notion of separating about or along a particular
path.
     3.17      Nggon     we    wat         nok            onyar,       be      onyar      z.               women two separate wild.pig intestines own kangaroo intestines own

             is        go down                         is-bot         go down along
3.3. 1 .3 'fHE ORAMMATICAUSATION OFket
    Ket also follows the same grarnmaticalisation procedure as bot and wa. The free form ket
is a LOCATIVE preposition. It precedes the location of the path of the action. For example, the
location where goods were being carried in example 3.20 is along the ground, that is by foot,
and the location of the path of the cutting across in example 3 . 2 1 was towards the interior
(rather than the sea).
   3.20      Men sam       suk      ket bur.
             I PL carry things LOC earth
             We carried the things, walking along.
   3.21      Men tot ket nden.
             1 PL cut LOC interior
             We cut across to the interior (path).
   As stated above, objects are frequently omitted in Abun, resulting in the preposition ke t
being adjacent to a verb. This has resulted in the combining of some verbs with ket with a
subsequent semantic shift. The free form ket occurs adjacent to the verbs mu 'go ' , ti 'stand' ,
tot 'cut ' , and e 'fall over' , but there is no evidence of semantic shift or change of prosody in
these cases, so ket remains as a free form and is not affixed to these verbs. However, ket has
become a suffix in the case of the two adjectives mbrin 'unconscious' in example 3.22 and
ye 'difficult' in example 3.23. This is clear because of both prosody and significant meaning
changes in these two examples. Another example of a change of meaning is the suffixation
of -ket with the verb ki 'say ' . The resultant word is ki-ket 'slander' .
   3.22      Ji mbrin-ket            nan gum reo

   The free form gat 'to spear, join' i s a regular verb as in example 3 . 24, and it also behaves
as an adverb meaning that an action is done with intensity or penetratingly. In example 3 . 25,
gat signifies that the act of entering new students of witchcraft into the training house was not
just at its old pace, but that now there was a new emphasis on doing it, and that emphasis
was more intense.
     3.24    Musa gat      nok.
             Musa spear wild.pig
             Musa speared the wild pig.
     3.25    An     sok    pa          ye-won              ne, i-be        gat.
             3sG enter young.men PERs-knowledge            DET its-new INf
             He is putting in young men (to train as) shamen, lots of new ones.
     Adverbs follow the object in Abun clauses. Since objects are frequently elided, the adverb
often directly follows the verb, just like the prepositions wa, bot and keto Some verbs and
nouns undergo prosody and semantic changes when they co-occur with the adverb gat, and
so they coalesce. In these cases, the semantic changes are not always equal to the
compositional meaning of the components. However, the inflected verbs do have notions of
intensity or pressure. The conversion of status from a free form (the adverb) to an inflection
on the verb is clear due to prosody and semantic changes. In example 3 . 26, the verb wer 'to
try (to seduce) ' combines with -gat to form wer-gat 'make a determined effort, work hard
at' . Likewise the verb ki 'speak' , combined with -gat, forms kigat 'speak persuasively ' .
Furthermore, the verb i '(be) sick' combines to form i-gat ' (be) frequently sick' i n example
3 .27.
     3.26    An    wer-gat     an    baca.
             3sG push-INT 3SG read
             Slhe pushed herselflhimself intensely to be able to ready.
     3. 27   An     yo    i-gat     saga nyim        nde reo
             3sG NEG sick-INf like          before NEG PERF
             She is not always sick like she had been.
   An alternative analysis is to consider this as word compounding, where it is actually the
verb gat that is coalescing with another verb. Sentences like example 3.28 show that indeed
both the verb and adverb gat can occur in the one clause. The verb makes clear that they are
spearing each other and the adverb conveys the manner in which they were doing it. In fact,
ndi and gat in example 3.28 are not compounding; rather both verbs stand alone on prosody
grounds, and there is certainly no change of compositional meaning compared to each verb's
meaning when they occur in this way. This i s a case of serial verbs. In contrast to this, when
the adverb and a verb co-occur coalescence results. So in example 3.29, the -gat in ndi-gat
refers to the intensity of fighting. Instead of an independent stress centre on each morpheme
the primary stress is on -gat, according to the stress patterns found in Abun words.
     3 .28   An    w e ndi      gat     yu           gat.
             3PL two fight spear each.other INf
             They (two) fought, spearing each other furiously.

              3PL two fight-tNT
              They (two) fought furiously.
   A few nouns have also combined with -gat to fonn verbs, such as: syim-gat 'hand-tNT: to
start' and syo-gat ' mouth-INT: to order' .

   Some verbs no longer have the uninflected forms in the language. For example, the form
syaugat 'to command' occurs, but syau does not.","[40, 41, 42, 43]"
"
10.2 COMPLEMENTISER do
   The purpose of the complementiser is to identify the subordinate clause it precedes as a
complement. Abun has only one complementiser, the free-form particle do. Do precedes the
complement clause just as the relative clause conjunction gato precedes the relative clause.
According to Noonan ( 1 985:47) ""complementisers typically derive rustorically from
pronouns, conjunctions, adpositions or case markers . . . "" In Abun the homophonous do­
'some of' has various functions such as do-gato 'the ones/those who ' , do-yo 'some of' , do­
wok 'the small one' and (warn) do-gri 'the third (time)' . While these could possibly be
related to the complementiser do, another more likely origin is a verb du 'to speak ' . In the
Abun Ji dialect the complementiser is usually pronounced as du (a few speakers use dudo).
Du appears to be a verb that is obsolete, meaning 'to say, to speak' . It is still evident in the
noun suk-du (lit. NOM-speak) 'story, news' and the verbs duwe ' say, teach', durnu 'grumble'
and duwer 'argue against' . In present-day Abun the verb 'to say' is ki, although du is
occasionally used with the same meaning. Du 'to say' could have become a complementiser.
This happens in some other languages. In Thai, for instance, waa 'to speak' has become a
complementiser introducing direct and indirect speech. As we see in the following section,
do introduces complements of predicates expressing speech and thought.",[176]
"
4.4. 1 ADVERBIAL PHRASE')
   Adverbial phrases consist of an adverb and an optional intensifier. In most cases such
phrases are realised by an adverb alone.
   There are several types of adverbs discussed in §3.3.4 such as time adverbs, manner
adverbs, directional adverbs and degree adverbs. Degree adverbs are used in forming
adverbial and adjectival phrases and will be discussed later in §5.5. The other three types
occur as free forms or as the head of an adverbial phrase. There is some flexibility in their
placement in the Abun sentence, but as a general rule time adverbs are sentence-initial while
manner and directional adverbs generall y fol low the object and precede prepositional phrases.
    The most flexible as to their placement in an Abun sentence are time adverbs. An example
below repeated from §3.3.4 (examples 3 .46a, b, c, d) i l lustrates this. Usuall y time adverbs
are sentence-initial, but to change the focus and semantic scope of the predicate they may
fol low the verb. This i s particularly significant in negative indicative sentences which are
discussed in §8.5. Also time adverbs can occur between a subject and verb on rare occasions,
as in example 4. 1 4b, breaking the normal pattern of Abun main clauses.
   4 . 1 4 a. Kam-dik-kam-dik   an        rna  rno ji    hi              nu.
              day-one-day-one   3SG       come LOC I SG POSS             house

            3 sG    day-one-day-one    come LOC ISG poss               house

            Everyday he came to my house.
         c. An      rna     kam-dik-kam-dik          rna  ji     hi      nu.
            3SG     come    day-one-day-one          LOC   ISG poss      house
            SUBJECT VERB    ADVERB                   LOCATIVE PHRASE
            He came everyday to my house.
         d. A n     rna    rna ji     hi          nu    kam-dik-kam-dik.
            3SG     come LOC I SG poss            house day-one-day-one
            SUBJECT VERB LCX:ATIVE PHRASE                  AD\IffiB
            He came to my house everyday.
    In Abun adverbs of manner there is some flexibility, but they generally follow the object,
where present. Therefore in intransitive clauses these adverbs directly follow the verb, as in
example 4. 1 5a, or another adjunct, 4. 1 5b; but they are unacceptable preverbally, 4. 1 5c, or
fol lowing any polarity, aspect, modality or mood particle.

    Usually an adverb indicating the manner of the action not only foI Iows the object but also
precedes the dative, as seen in example 4. 1 6a. It may also fol low any adjunct including the
dative as in 4. 1 6b, but it may not occur in any position ahead of the object, as in 4. 1 6c to
4. 1 6e.

   Adverbs indicating direction also occur in the same position, that is, fol lowing the object
and preceding any prepositional phrase, as in example 4. 1 7 . These adverbs are free-form

5.7 . 1 CONJUNCTION
     There are five different strategies used to conjoin phrases and sentences listed by Payne
( 1 985a:25-37), consisting of the use of simple juxtaposition (he calls the 'zero' strategy),
'and' , 'with' , 'pronoun' and 'dual ' strategies. Abun employs the first three types of strategies
to conjoin phrases and sentences.
    In simple juxtaposition, there are no markers of conjunction. Juxtaposition is a normal
alternative existing alongside other strategies. This strategy is permitted at all levels from
sentence to noun phrase, as well as in verb phrases (verb phrases, incidentally, only allow
this type of strategy to give what appear to be serial verb formations). Examples are:(i) Sentence:
     5 . 163    Ye      kwam            ye        gu            an.
                people hit.with.instr people hit.with.hand 3SG
                They were hitting with a stick and (they were) punching him.(ii) Prepositional Phrase:
     5 . 1 64   Ye     ma    kagit Pet kagit Bamogwem               kagit Bikar.
                people come from Pef from Bamogwem                  from B ikar
                They came from Pef, Bamogwem and Bikar.(iii) Noun Phrase:
     5 . 1 65   An    hi    nggon nggon y i        dom an      rot nde.
                3sG poss woman woman other also 3SG touch NEG
                His wife and other women also he must not touch.
PHRASE STRUCfURE                                                                             95(iv) Verb Phrase:
   5 . 1 66   An    kas rn u sern      rno nden.
              3so run go       sleep LOC bush
              He ran and went and slept in the bush.
   5 . 1 67   Ye-suk-m ise    rna    nai     gwat an      mu keto
              PERs-NoM-evil   come capture take     3so go west
              The police came and caught him and took him westward.
    Apposition, where the two heads involved stand in a mutually attributive relationship (that
is, each head is at the same time an attribute of the other head), is a special case of this
unmarked type of coordination. Alternatively, when the heads are single nouns, as in
examples 5. 1 68 and 5 . 169, they may be analysed as a single noun phrase, as discussed in
§5.2. 1 above. Thus an apposition noun phrase in Abun has the structure of NP + NP. Two or
more noun phrases are j uxtaposed. For example:
   5 . 1 68   Men ye-nden      git nggruk     nde.
              I PL PERS-bush eat turtle       NEG
              We, 'Bush' people must not eat turtle.
   5. 1 69    Ye      ne ye-su-go-te              ye- Waropen.
              person DEf PERs-head-hair-black PERs-Waropen
              That person is a Papuan, a Waropen.
   5 . 1 70   Ji   bi     nji      ye-guru         rno    nden     kwop reo
              I so poss brother PERs-teacher LOC          bush     die  PERF
              My brother, the inland teacher, has died.
   With recursive apposition, the head of the noun phrase is repeated, as in example 5 . 1 7 1 .
B y way of contrast, i n the case where a subsequent noun phrase modifies the first using the
noun modifying particle to, the head of the phrase is not repeated, as in 5 . 1 72.
   5.171      An    it     san     be,       san     rno    sern     ne    san
              3so   put.on clothes new       clothes LOC    sea      DEf   clothes
              to-d     san     pis.
              EXT-this clothes wrap. around
              She put on new clothes, modem clothes, these clothes, wrap-around clothes.
   5. 1 72    Wo suk-fo         to     ndarn syor          ne yo,         nu-we      git nde.

              But a forbidden thing, that is that cassowary, you two can not eat.
   In the 'and' strategy, the coordinating particle e is used as a conjunction in sentences and
phrases. In the case of noun phrases the form is:                                       [NP e ] n NP e
   There is no distinction in meaning between the use of this particle and simple
juxtaposition. Therefore examples are found in sentences, prepositional phrases and noun
phrases similar to those examples given above. In all cases e may be added between the noun
phrases, but may not be added for verb phrases. This particle is widely used and conjoins
phrases in subject or object positions in Abun sentences, as in examples 5 . 1 73 and 5 . 1 74
96                                                                                            CHAPTER 5
respectively. Topicalised objects may also include complex phrases conjoined by e , as in
example 5 . 1 75 .
     5 . 1 73    Abi    e   Arun e         Joni e           nm     gro     mut      et.

                 Eat animals such as wild pigs, kangaroos, tree kangaroos and the like.
     5. 175      Mbos e     ndabu        e     ndam ga       sye    ne      e       an
                 pigeon and dove         and   bird REI..    big    DEI'    and     3PL
                Iowa        sino.
                forbidden all
                Pigeons, doves and birds that are big, they are all forbidden (for women to eat).
  The 'with ' strategy is widely used to conjoin noun phrases. It is rarel y used in sentences
and is not permitted in prepositional phrase constructions. Payne points out that this is a very
common strategy and that usually the coordinating particle is identical to the adposition
marking the associative sense of 'with' ( 1 985a:29). This is not quite true for Abun, where the
coordinating particle is si 'with ' , while the associative preposition is su 'with ' ; the two forms
nevertheless appearing cognate.
     The 'with' strategy is evident in Abun coordinate noun phrases in either of two ways:     1.     [NP si] n NP
     5 . 1 76    Ji si    Dina si   Yulius si   Isak,              men      ma   nyim          mo

                 1 . I with Dina and with Yulius and with Isak, we had come ahead to the house.
                 2. Dina and Yulius and Isak and I, we (all) had come ahead (of the others) to
                    the house.","[106, 107, 108]"
"
4.7.2 TOPICALISATION
   Foley and Van Valin ( 1 985:355) define topicalisation as a procedure used to place an NP,
other than a subject, sentence-initially. In contrast to passive structures which are clause­
internal, Foley and Van Valin consider topicalisation as clause-external. They say,
''Topicalisation .. .involve(s) the occurrence of an external topic NP fol lowed by a sentence
which relates to it in some way"".
   In Abun, simple prepositioning is used to foreground objects and mo locative phrases
with no pronoun trace left in the sentence. The foregrounded item becomes the topic upon
which a comment follows. For example:
     4.57    Yu     ne     ye     gwat mu mo nden.
             bag AN<\. 3INDEF take        go to        bush
             1 . The bag, someone took (it) to the bush.
             2. The bag was taken to the bush.
     4.58    Mo nden ne men git              boge.
             LOC bush AN<\. I PL eat         fish
             In the bush we ate fish.
   Foley and Van Valin ( 1 985 : 356) claim that "" ... the primary functions of these [topicalised]
constructions are to introduce new referents into a discourse, or to reintroduce a referent
which was previously introduced but which has not been mentioned in the immediately
preceding discourse"".
   The function of topicalisation in Abun is the second of those mentioned above, namely to
reintroduce a previously introduced referent. However, the referent may have been mentioned
in the immediately preceding sentence, such as in example 4.59.
     4.59    An     mu     me    su-git     yak   mo      nden.
             3SG    go     see   NOM-eat    j ump LOC     outside
             Su-git     jon      ne     men grem kop          mo dapur.
             NOM-eat     cooked AN<\. I PL      put    aside LOC kitchen
             He went quickly outside to see the food. The cooked food, we had put aside in
             the kitchen.
CLAUSE STRUCTURE                                                                              63   In Abun, topicalisation does not occur in isolation. The object or location must have been
mentioned in previous discussion. For this reason, in all cases of topicaJisation in Abun, the
determiner, or more specifically the anaphoric referent ne, is obligatory. In example 4.59
'food' was already mentioned in the sentence previous to the one where it is topicaJised.
   Foley and Van Valin ( 1 985:30 1 ) also make the point that in most languages passive is
restricted to core constituents while topicalisation is not. In Abun, de-focusing constructions
are limited to the core, whereas topicalisation is also possible with peripheral constituents, but
only with mo locative phrases, as seen in example 4.60. Topicalisation of other phrase types
such as benefactive (4.6 1 ) or instrumental (4.62) is unacceptable to an Abun speaker.
   4.60       Mo kampung mit               ne     an gu      ye     or              reo
              LOC village         inside AN<\. 3 sG kill     3INDEF completely      PffiF
              Inside that village she had killed everyone.
   4.6 1      * Wa Wonja Marta kon           su-git.
              BEN Wonja Marta cook NOM-eat
              For Wonj a, Marta cooked food.
   4.62       *Su m bam an gu             ndar     ne    kwop.
              with axe       3sG kill dog          DEf   die
              With an axe he killed the dog.
   Regarding the frequency of topicalisation in Abun, in a sample of five different stories by
five different speakers, seven examples of topicalisation were found, four of object fronting,
and three of mo locative phrase fronting. This represented about 1 .5 % of the clauses
examined. Thus topicalisation, although possible, is uncommon in Abun.","[74, 75]"
"
32   It may appear confusing to use Foley' s definition of the terms REA LIS and IRREALIS since these terms
     are often used to describe not tense, but mood (for example see Giv6n 1 984:255). However,
     Foley's term 'status' which he divides further into 'realis' and 'irrealis' closely approximates the
     semantic distinction between the two postpositional conjunctions sa and yo .
1 94                                                                                      CHAPTER 1 11 1 .2. 1 THE REALIS CONJUNCTION sa
   When a language indicates the temporal setting of events expressed within clauses it may
do so by a formal grammatical category tense, by time words or a combination of both
strategies. In regard to complex sentences, tense as a category may be marked within the
component clauses and particular conjunctions may convey particular 'marked' time
meanings, such as 'before ' , 'after' , 'as ' , and 'while' . The Abun conjunction sa carries the
grammatical information of 'realis', but in relation to specific time concepts is unmarked.
Thus it could be considered a general time subordinator and translated into English as
'when.REALIS' . Sa indicates that the clauses it joins are in realis time setting. By usage of sa
hearers know that the connected events expressed by the clauses are in the past, that they
have already occurred. When clauses are joined by sa, speakers usually pause after sa,
indicating that sa is considered to be part of the preceding clause. Nevertheless sa is still a
conjunction or means of joining two clauses in Abun. It is not possible to end a sentence
with sa. Therefore clauses marked by sa are dependent temporal clauses in the same way as
the English 'when' clause. Sa i s a sentence-medial subordinating conj unction and i s a
constituent of the first clause of a complex sentence which has the following structure:
                                      [CLAUSE 1 + sa] + CLAUSE 2
   The following examples are typical of the way sa is used in Abun:
   1 1 .3     Men kern rno        karnpung     sa            Rahel     hi     ai     farkor an.
              I PL stay i n    village      when.REAL Rachel poss father teach                 3sG
              When we stayed in the village, Rachel ' s father taught her.
   1 1 .4    Mensern rnonekret             Marten sa                Marten rna      karn Selasa.
              I PL sleep there wait.for Marten when.REAL Marten come                day     Tuesday
              We slept there, waiting for Marten and he came on Tuesday.
   As a general time subordinator the range of meanings conveyed by sa is wide. Sa is a
temporal link between clauses and as such can be used to indicate the following range of
meanings:
                  ( 1 ) precedence            whenlbefore
                  (2) subsequence             when/after
                  (3) simultaneity            when/while
                  (4) point coincidence       when/as/, just then
   Giv6n describes a general subordinator such as sa as being semantically ' less marked' .
Conj unctions such as 'before ' , ' after' , 'while' and the like are considered to indicate 'specific
temporal relations' . Therefore Giv6n ( 1 990:828) considers that ""Such less-marked coding
strategy is successful when the semantic specificity of the temporal relation can be inferred
from other features of the two clauses - most commonly from the verb and its tense-aspect.""
Since in Abun the conjunction itself indicates the 'tense' or time setting, it is not necessary to
use other means in order to indicate the specific temporal relation concerned. In the examples
below the extent of temporal relations that sa can convey is shown together with more
specific means of indicating these.

               1 . When we carried (them) up to the house, three (fish) had already died.
               2. By the time we reached the house three had already died.

               1 . When I came he had not yet arrived.
               2. By the time I came he had not yet arrived.
   The above examples indicate temporal precedence, which in many languages is indicated
by a specific time word meaning 'before ' . Abun has no single word which can be translated
as 'before ' . Instead the negative particle nde combined with the incompletive aspect particle
to are used to indicate 'not yet'. In the above examples there are two further means of
inferring the time relation in addition to the conjunction itself. Example 1 1 .5 has the second
clause marked by the perfect aspect particle) 3 In example 1 1 .6 the temporal precedence
relation is more explicitly marked by nde to 'not yetlbefore' again on the second clause.
These particles may behave as a conjunction without the need for the general subordinator sa.
If used in a clause within a complex sentence nde to has the specific meaning of 'before ' .
For example:
     1 1 .7    Tepsu         gane j i   yo fa i  Apner nde to,   Apner                      dam

               1 . At that time before I knew Apner, he did not know me either.
               2. At that time I did not yet know Apner, he did not know me either.","[205, 206, 207]"
