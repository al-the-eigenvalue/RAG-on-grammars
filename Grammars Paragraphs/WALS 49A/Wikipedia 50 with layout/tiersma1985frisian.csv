     All   the question words hoe, wa, wannear, wér, and wat function                        as

 already terminate in t: hoe’t soks kin is my in riedsel ‘how such things are

 Because of the potential for ambiguity, preposing is often avoided where

As in English, there are certain impersonal constructions in Frisian

      it hat juster tongere ‘it thundered yesterday’
                                                                                          or [as]) is added to soften the impact of the order:

5.2.4. Intonational questions                                                                          Not uncommon in Frisian is to have a period (phonetically, a pause) between
                                                                                                     two conjoined sentences, with the result that a coordinating conjunction may begin
Another way of forming questions is by using question intonation — rising pitch                      a sentence. The following are some such sentences from De Siinde fan Haitze
at the end of an utterance — on declarative sentences:                                               Holwerda by U. van Houten:
       __¥      4%                                                                                       Dat de boer mocht ris oer it skouder sizze...
       de boat is lek ‘the boat is leaking’                                                                ‘So the farmer would say over his shoulder...’
                                                                                                         Mar sa mocht men ek wer net!
       _—                                                                                                  ‘But that was also not permissible!’
       de boat is lek? ‘the boat is leaking?’                                                            Want hy mocht dan syn lekken en brekken hawwe...

The expectation with an intonational question is that the response will be yes. In                       En hja wisten him te finen as der eat dien wurde moast
addition, it may express some disbelief that the situation is true, especially with                         ‘And they knew where to find him if something needed to be done’
very high pitch at the end of the sentence. Do komst ek? ‘you’re coming too?’ is
a question with slightly rising intonation, but can also indicate surprise when the                   Ineach of these cases, the conjunction must act as a transition from a previously
pitch rises more steeply.                                                                             expressed sentence or theme without physically connecting the sentences.

Notice that in each case the same verb must be involved, but not necessarily in       Closely related to the above (and sometimes considered derived fromit) is phrasal
the same form. In linguistic terminology the deletion of identical verbs in           coordination, where two separate constituents (not clauses) are conjoined by a
conjoined structures is called gapping. This process also applies with more           conjunction into one larger constituent of the same category. Thus the two nouns
complex verb phrases:                                                                 Jan and Pyt may be joined into one larger constituent Jan en Pyt, which acts like
                                                                                      a plural noun. The sentences which have such phrasal conjunction must be con-
       ik ha net in skiep sjoen, mar (ik ha) in hin (sjoen)                           sidered, at least at the surface level, to be simple rather than complex. Compare
          ‘I didn’t see a sheep, but (I saw) a dog’                                    the conjoined (and reduced) sentences ik ha in skiep sjoen en in hin and hawwe
       hawwe jo in appel keazen, of (hawwe jo) in par (keazen)?                       jo in appel iten of in par? with the examples of phrasal conjunction below:
          ‘did you choose an apple or (did you choose) a pear?’
                                                                                           ik ha in skiep en in hin sjoen ‘I saw a sheep and a dog’
 It needs to be mentioned that gapping — the deletion of the verb and, when they           hawwe jo in appel of in par iten? ‘did you eat an apple or a pear?’
 are identical, its complements and modifiers — may take place only when some
element following the verb is left standing (hence the name gapping). For             Similar is the common process in Frisian by which derivational prefixes, verb
 instance, Durk drinkt hjoed bearenburch en Jan drinkt hjoed bearenburch              particles, or first elements of compounds are conjoined and reduced. Again, the
cannot be reduced by gapping to *Durk drinkt hjoed bearenburch en Jan, since          material which may be omitted is placed in parentheses:
nothing which followed the verb in the second conjunct remains; the entire
predicate has been deleted. But Durk drinkt hjoed bearenburch en Jan jenever               op(geande) en delgeande twaliiden
is well-formed. Often the adverbs al, wol, ek, and net suffice for the purpose of             ‘rising and falling diphthongs’

Conjoined sentences with multiple objects may become ambiguous when deletion
occurs: Jetze joech mem in tit en heit in han may mean ‘Jetze gave moma kiss               is it in op- of @ndergeande sinne? ‘is it a rising or setting sun?’
and he gave dad a handshake’ or ‘Jetze gave mom a kiss and dad gave her a
handshake’. The ambiguity rests in the fact that once the verb is deleted, it is no

wylst, omdat, and nei’t, and the finite verb (die, wie, and hienen) occurs at the                 ‘that that young man is a student, puzzles me’
end of the clause, following the non-finite verbs (V2), if there are any. As was               dat se hjir gjin harken ferkeapje, is wat frjemd
mentioned in sec. 4.7.2, the subordinating conjunction is almost always followed                  ‘that they don’t sell any rakes here is somewhat strange
by dat ‘that’, oft, or the reduced form ’t. This ’t does not appear when the                   dat Wytske gjin sinten hie, die juster bliken
conjunction ends in t, however. An overview of the order of verbs in subordinate                  ‘that Wytske had no money became evident yesterday

   Some subordinate clauses function like sentential adverbs (introduced by no’t,          By means of what is called extraposition, an it (which functions as a dummy)

the modern language. These tend to be preserved in phrases like op ’en doer                    An adjective following in takes the ending -en when it stands alone or before ien (as in grienen
‘eventually’; mei der tiid ‘in time’; des Heare ‘of the Lord’; te’n ein ‘finished,             ien, sec. 4.1.2.3), which is thus a likely source for the ‘extra’ -en in sa’nen ien and hoe’nen
to the end’.                                                                                   ien.
   Another relic of this nature is the use of de for the dative case of it in a few
established contexts, as in it ’e hits ‘out of the house’; yn ’e Ais ‘in the house’          4.1.1.4. Demonstrative pronouns

     Expressions of time with   fan present another peculiarity in the use of the
article. The phrase fan 't jier, for example, means ‘this year’. Yet the seasons,                 it his, dit hits, dat hits ‘the, this, that house’
though not neuter, sometimes take fan ’t as well, despite the fact that fan de (or                de frou, dizze frou, dy frou ‘the, this, that woman’
fan ’e) would be expected: fan ’t winter ‘this winter’; fan ’t hjerst ‘this autumn’;              de minsken, dizze minsken, dy minsken ‘the, these, those people’
fan ’t maitiid ‘this spring’; and fan ’t simmer ‘this summer’. Other expressions
 of time do not share this aberration: fan ’e moarn ‘this morning’; fan ’e wike              In other words, dizze and dy go with common nouns in the singular and with all
 ‘this week’.                                                                                nouns in the plural; dit and dat go exclusively with neuter singular nouns.

With a noun phrase consisting only of an adjective plus noun, the adjective is
inflected (i.e., the suffix -e is added) before a common noun and is uninflected                             (1)         An adjective is inflected before a common noun and before any plural
before one which is neuter. In the plural it is always inflected:                                                        noun.
                                                                                                             (2)         An adjective is inflected before a neuter singular noun only when

The addition of a determiner complicates the situation somewhat. Leaving aside                             lofter ‘left’:
a few exceptional cases for the moment, it is safe to say that any adjective which
modifies a common noun or any plural noun will be inflected, regardless of what                                    dy izeren toer                    ‘that iron tower’

     NOTE: The inflection of adjectives ending in -en is further discussed by Dykstra (1984) and       uninflected:
     Dyk (1996).
                                                                                                           moaier frou is der net                             ‘there is no lovelier woman’

The ending -en occurs on adjectives before ien ‘one’ in phrases like in goeden                                                                                found’
ien ‘a good one’; sa’n readen ien ‘sucha red one’. The word ien may be dropped
altogether, leaving in readen or in goeden. Note that these comments only hold                         Beyond this, the comparative is inflected just as is the positive:
following the articles in, sa’n and gjin; with de or it the adjective alone (without
ien) suffices: de reade ‘the red one’; it dlde ‘the old, that which is old’.                               in griene wein                         ‘a green wagon’
  The -en suffix may also be used instead of -e to add emphasis. This leads to                             in grienere wein                       a greener wagon’
noun phrases like hy is in dregen baas ‘he is a tough guy’ and it is in djippen                            grienere weinen                         greener wagons
tinker ‘he is a deep thinker’. As with the above, this ending is found only after                          stin iten                              ‘healthy food

When        The Frisian word as is the equivalent of English than                              in comparative
  it had been reduced and reanalysed as an adjectival ending, a new ien could be added. The            constructions, as well as when equivalence is expressed:
  emphatic ending -en derives from the indefinite article in ‘a’ which had been incorporated
  into the adjective in constructions like Middle Frisian so swieten rook (Eng. so sweet a flavor).         Oene is jonger as syn omkesizzer                   ‘Oene is younger than his nephew
  The development of the emphatic ending -en in Frisian is discussed by Van der Meer (1987).                                                                   (his “uncle-sayer”’)

Comparatives of adjectives are normally formed by the addition of -er to the stem,
and superlatives by adding -st:                                                                         4.1.2.5. Irregular comparison

     ier       ‘early’,       earder [jeder],   earst [vast] ‘first,   earliest’                 phrases like it hits fan bakkers ‘the baker’ s house’, although this is quite a literary

In addition to being the comparative and superlative of graach, the forms leaver                   Certain nouns show possession with the ending -e. These are chiefly relationship
and leafst are also the regular comparatives of the adjective leaf ‘dear’. In that               terms like heit ‘father’, mem ‘mother’ , pake ‘grandfather’ , beppe* grandmother’,

  far’, swier ‘heavy’, and moai ‘pretty’ all undergo breaking (sec. 2.1.2.6).
    Note also that d must be inserted before the suffix -er with all stems which end                 us pake klok                         ‘our grandfather’s clock’

occur only with the d, hence here the rule is not optional. The superlative of min
is minst [mé:st] ‘least; worst’, which obligatorily has a long, nasalized vowel.                 This process is often used with the names of married couples, as in Sikke Anny

                                                                                                    habituallyat a particular time: Tiisdeis ‘on Tuesdays’; moarns ‘mornings’, maitiids ‘in spring’.
Except for the plural ending, nouns in Frisian are essentially undeclined. There                    A specific time may be indicated by the addition of the article: de Tongersdeis ‘on Thursday’

4.1.3.1. Possession
There are two oft-used methods of expressing possession in Frisian. One is by                     (1) -s is the plural marker of words ending in unaccented -en, -em, -el, -er, -ert.
inserting the possessor into a prepositional phrase with the preposition fan: de                      In addition, all diminutives take -s, as do many words of obviously foreign
hoed fan Jetze ‘the hat of Jetze, Jetze’s hat’; de kaai fan syn mem ‘the key of his                   origin terminating in vowels.

  The true genitive with -s ending is also used in literary conte         indi                         biezem                  ‘broom’                              biezems

language (65%) and especially those who can write it (10%) are considerably
lower. It should be emphasized that this survey includes all of the province, even
those areas which have been essentially non-Frisian speaking for centuries.
   In terms of language loyalty, it is interesting that 52% of those sampled speak
exclusively Frisian to a spouse/partner, and that another 4% speak both Frisian
and some Dutch dialect (Town Frisian, Standard Dutch, etc.). Approximately
24% use Standard Dutch exclusively for this purpose, while 13% use a local
dialect (mainly Town Frisian or a Saxon dialect). Of those in the sample who
speak Frisian, only 60% speak it to a shopkeeper, and only 42% report that they
converse with the doctor in their first language. Apparently, some Frisians fear
that people of perceived higher social status (who are often a more mobile
segment of the population and therefore are less likely to work in their area of
birth) either will not understand Frisian or will find it impolite to be addressed
in the local language.

This situation is complicated by its interaction with assimilation, however. The                                 fiistkje         ‘shake hands’ (from fist)                            [fuskja]
compound syddoar ‘side door’ should undergo devoicing to *[sitdoer], but by                                       roastkje        ‘to rust’ (from roast)                               [rwaskje]
voicing assimilation (sec. 2.2.2.1) the [t] reverts to [d] to produce [siddoor].                                  kostje          ‘cost’ (from kost)
  Beyond this, while all stems are devoiced before the diminutive ending, only                                                                                                         [kosjo]
certain ones are devoiced preceding the suffix -lik: soarchlik ‘sorrowful’ and                              Of course, the t remains under other circumstances, as may be seen in forms like
beweechlik ‘mobile’ are devoiced, whereas deeglik ‘suitable’ and mooglik                                    kast ‘closet’ and kisten ‘chests’.
‘possible’ retain the underlying voiced fricative. This may be related to the fact

‘at night’, where [x] becomes [k] by regular rule (see sec. 2.2.2.10).                                     sometimes pronounced, as in sport or modern.
  A stem ending in t, followed by a suffix beginning with st, results in the deletion                        This rule leads to alternation in the paradigms of a number of words, as in the
of stem-final tf:                                                                                          conjugation of hearre ‘hear’:

It is imperative that the t terminate the stem. Thus, with a stem ending in ts, where                            p-p.            heard                  [jet]
the morpheme boundary follows the s, the criteria for deletion are not met, and
the r and s both remain, as in fytst ‘(she) cycles’ (fyts + t), which is pronounced                        Elsewhere the r is also deleted. The superlative of djoer ‘expensive’ is djoerst
[fitst]. Strangely enough, the deletion of t always occurs with verbs, while in                            [djuast], and derived words like earlik ‘honest’ and learsum ‘educational’ may
superlatives it is normal with some (hytst ‘hottest’, grutst ‘largest’, koartst                            be pronounced [talek] and [lasom]. When the r is syllabified, however, as in
‘shortest’) and less so with others (readst ‘reddest’, wietst ‘wettest’).                                  words like spikert ‘(he) nails’, it is not deleted: [spikyt]. But if no syllabification
                                                                                                           takes place, which is also possible, this verb is pronounced [spiket].
     NOTE: More on the deletion of t in certain consonant clusters can be found in Hoekstra (1985)           Within complex words the rule of r-deletion is more general. Recall that
     and Visser (1993b). Other types of consonant cluster simplification are more sporadic. The            word-internally and before inflectional affixes, r is dropped only before dental
     words doch ‘do’, sjoch ‘see’, is ‘is’, wol ‘want’, sil ‘shall’, hoech ‘must’, troch ‘through’, noch   consonants. But in derived words and compounds it is usually deleted before any
     ‘still’, graach ‘gladly’ and genéch ‘enough’ often drop the final consonant before a consonant-       consonant besides h. I will refer to this as expanded r-deletion. The prefixes and
     initial suffix or before another word beginning with a consonant:                                     particles fer, oer, foar, oar, and wer are subject to expanded r-deletion when they

     While the above are quite accepted in conversational Frisian (in fact, simplification is required
     with wolst and silst), the deletion of the consonant is much less permissible before h or vowels.     In true compounds expanded r-deletion also occurs, but while it is obligatory with
     See further Van der Meer and De Graaf (1983).                                                         the above prefixes, it is optional with compounds. Thus hierkaam ‘hair comb’ and

the d is now simply part of the word, rather than being inserted by rule.

   Rather more subtle are cases of a stem plus suffix which, often due to
irregularities in meaning, are no longer generated from the base form by rule. Thus
even though they can be analyzed into separate morphemes, they act as words and

the d is therefore part of that lexical item, rather than being viewed as inserted.
An example of this is minder ‘worse, fewer’, which is strictly speaking the com-

parative of min ‘bad’ but deviates from it semantically. Similar is the word bjinder
                                                                                           related to an increase in pitch and amplitude. In other words, a stressed syllable

 agentive in meaning. It is therefore a word unto itself, and the d is part of that
                                                                                           pitch. Stress is indicated here by a single quotation mark [’] before the stressed
 word. Bjinner is the real agentive of bjinne in the meaning of ‘a person who
 scrubs’.                                                                                  syllable.

 2.2.2.10. The nature of /g/
 What is written g in Frisian may have several different phonetic manifestations.
                                                                                           When the last syllable is inherently unstressable, that is, a schwa or syllabic
 At the beginning of a word it is universally the voiced velar stop [g], as in gean
                                                                                           consonant, the stress in words of French origin is penultimate:
 ‘go’ or gjin ‘none’. This also holds when a prefix is attached to the stem, as in
 begjinne ‘begin’ and meigean ‘go along’. In addition, when g occurs word-                                           mi’rakel        mirt’ade

 internally with stress on the immediately following syllable, it is also articulated
 as a stop: au’gustus ‘August’ or ba’gaazje ‘baggage’.                                      Compounds (words made up of two or more independent lexical items) often have

 Normally, when an adjective and a noun come together, each is stressed equally:
                                                                                                     Adjectives: iin ’mooglik fol’slein fol’woeksen          ta’gonklik
  jonge ‘man. In contrast, the stress of jonge’man indicates that it must be
 considered a compound, rather than simply an adjective and noun.
                                                                                                     Adverbs/prepositions: by’lans foar’op foar’by fan’sels fan’nacht om’heech
   There is a further set of compounds in which the first part is a noun, but which,
                                                                                                     oer’ein fan’wegen
 unlike compounds like ’ gasthiis, have stress on the second element. The expla-
 nation may lie in part in the fact that often the first element, though a noun,
                                                                                                   Related to the above is the alternation present in certain noun-adjective pairs:
 somehow modifies the second. Whatever the reason, these compounds are stressed
 as though the first element were an adjective:

Certain compound geographical names and compounds relating to time also have
a tendency to receive stress on the second element:                                                A class of adverbs which goes counter to those above is those formed with inoar
                                                                                                   or elkoar, which are roughly synonymous:

Suffixes can have varying effects on stress. Indigenous ones like -lik, -ich,
-achtich, -ens, -dom, -heid, -skip, -ster and others, as well as all inflectional                  Stress in verbs, like that of many Germanic languages, is often dependent upon

                                                                                                    like the foar in ’foargean ‘to go ahead’, which can stand alone, as in wy geane

The state of affairs with prefixes is more intricate. First of all, there are prefixes
which are never stressed, like be-, ge-, fint-, fer-, and te-:                                     The inherently unstressed prefixes be-, ge-, fer-, te-, and ant- might simply be
                                                                                                   viewed as inseparable prefixes, which accounts for why they are never accented.

Other prefixes, mainly oar- and ant-, always receive primary stress:                                 Non-primary stresses have been largely ignored in this discussion, not because
                                                                                                   they do not exist, but rather because their presence is largely predictable given the

Akademy in the near future. The two works combined should make a good
reference set for students or scholars beginning their study of Frisian. Those who
wish to study the language in greater depth should find the notes and expanded
bibliography in this book quite useful.
    For those familiar with the first edition, I should note that changes in the text
itself have been relatively modest. For the most part, I have limited myself to
correcting errors and misprints in the first edition. In some instances, I have tried
to state certain points more clearly. I have also replaced a few examples where
I found better ones.
    The major changes will be found in the notes interspersed in the text and in the
bibliography. These changes are almost entirely the work of Jarich Hoekstra,
formerly of the Fryske Akademy and now professor at the Nordfriesische
Worterbuchstelle at the Christian-Albrechts-Universitaét in Kiel, Germany.
Because he is so familiar with current research on Frisian, he has been able to
add references and commentary to the textual notes regarding recent develop-
ments. Dr. Hoekstra has also brought the bibliography up to date. Both of these
changes should be extremely useful to those interested in Frisian linguistics. Iam
very grateful to him for undertaking this task, as well as for his comments on
other aspects of the first edition.
    This grammar describes standard or literary Frisian (see section 1.3.2).
Standard Frisian is based mainly on the dialect called Klaaifrysk, although it
incorporates elements of other dialects also. And it tends to be fairly con-
servative, rejecting many Dutch words and constructions even when they are
widely used among ordinary Frisian speakers. Because Standard Frisian is used
for most literary efforts, is taught in the schools, and is used for official
purposes, it will form the basis for this grammar. At the same time, I have tried

        The extent to which breaking is applied varies somewhat from dialect to dialect. In the

     speakers use more breaking than does the younger generation. See in this regard Boelens

       An interesting correlation of breaking with dialects is that certain verbs have broken and                                                in the mouth than the English t. This applies to all the

Past participles may also precede the noun, as in English the eaten cheese. There

  NOTE: One reason for the aversion to attributive ‘bare’ past participles is probably

What is implied here is that the listener seems to believe that the speaker will              ‘how much of this book have you understood?’

      myn nichtsje dy’t trije jier mei har man yn Burgum wenne hat...
        ‘my cousin who has lived in Burgum with her husband for three years...’The first example, a unrestricted relative clause, has fairly normal intonation, with
some stress on the content words. The second, restricted, relative clause has what
is quite similar to contrastive stress, as evidenced by the reduced stress on all but
the last stressable element. The reason for this seems to be that the entire clause
‘my cousin who has lived in Burgum with her husband for three years’ is being
implicitly contrasted to another cousin.
   Yes-no questions are characterized by rising intonation on the last content word:

    short. The effects of assimilation and devoicing (see sec. 2.2.2.1 and 2.2.2.3) are
    predictable and are therefore not extensively mentioned in this chart. For example,

             Always represents [h]. It is normally silent in most dialects before [w]              closed syllables - pet and petten, for example. Notice that this can lead to some
             or [j], as in Ajerst or hoart. In the older spelling it appeared as a silent          alternation in the spelling of related words, even when the pronunciation of the

                                                                                                     4 MORPHOLOGY
This same rule applies, very roughly, to the effects of breaking, where a single
consonant after a diphthong indicates a falling (unbroken) diphthong and a double
consonant the presence of a broken, or rising diphthong:       soan       ‘son’       ad          soannen     [swann]         ‘sons’
       toan       ‘tone’      >           toanen      [toonn]         ‘tones’
                                                                                                     4.1. The noun phrase
Yet this rule really only works with any consistency on plurals, since the
diminutives toantsje [toontsje] and soantsje [swantsja] are indistinguishable in                     In Frisian, a noun phrase may consist of a noun standing by itself, of oneor more

with [i] is that it is written y in closed syllables (wy) and [i] in open syllables                  where the adverb can be present only if there is an adjective for it to modify, and
