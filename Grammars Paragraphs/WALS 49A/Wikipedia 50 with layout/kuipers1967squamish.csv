"                                     E. ALTERNATIONS78. Except for the partly automatic alternations to which roots ending in a sonant
are subject (see 14-19, 31-34), for the loss of an initial /h/ or /?/ (43, 44) and for the
alternation of full and /a/- or zero-grade (57), Squamish has but a few instances of
alternating forms. Those concerning clitics were already mentioned in 56. All other
cases are incidental; they are summed u p here according to the type of alternation
concerned.
   (1) Free variation of forms with /t'/ and /X,'/ in /t'aX.na'im, X'aLna'im/ 'go on a
prolonged hunting-trip', /st'l.mu'Pt, sX'l.mu't/ 'old person' (the absence of /?/ in the
second form is probably incidental).
   (2) Free variation of forms with /X'a?-/ and ¡V-l in /X'aPa'Sn, k'a'Sn/ '(invite to)
feast, party, dance (not potlatch)', /X'aPa'nq, Vanq/ 'potlatch' (cf. also /X'aPi'min/
'sinew' and Cw. X'i 'man 'tendon').
   (3) Loss of final vowel before vocalic suffixes in /hii 1 , hi-/ 'big', /?ina, Pin-/ 'the
one, the other'.
   (4) Roots with any vowel can have an alternant with /i/ in diminutive forms. This
60                                     PHONOLOGYhappens regularly in diminutive reduplications of polysyllabic stems, and occasionally
in other cases, see 159. In a few instances, roots with /a/ appear with /i/ in related
words without obvious diminutive meaning, cf. /malq""/ 'be mixed' and /mlrmi'lC'/
'get mixed up', /A.a'C'-tn/'knife' and /Xi5*/ 'be cut', the unique pair /sui'uPlus/ 'young
man' and /sua'uPlus/ 'id., plur.'. The difference /a/ w. /i/ is accompanied by other
phonetic differences in /XauPs/ 'new, fresh' and /Xis-i?/ (stress unknown) 'be fresh',
/X,au?/ 'recover; run away (ab. a captive)' and /X,'iu?/ 'run away (ab. a captive)'.

                                            VI                                   INTRODUCTION
79. Squamish words fall into two main classes: full words and clitics.
   Full words may consist of a single morpheme, of a reduplication of such a mor-
pheme, or of either of these two combined with one or more affixes. Productive
compounds of free forms do not occur.
   The affixes fall into five main categories: (1) personal affixes, (2) modal and adverbial
affixes, (3) relative case prefix, (4) plain nominalizer and verbalizers, (5) others. This
last category is not homogeneous. It contains elements which — besides having a
lexical meaning — nominalize or verbalize a unit to which they are added, and
elements which do not. It contains elements with a clear and concrete lexical meaning,
elements which might be called grammatical, and elements to which no clear meaning
can be ascribed (formatives).
   A unit which contains no other affixes than those mentioned under (4) and (5) above
is called a stem. Since the affixes (1-3) are added at the beginning or end of a word,
a stem is a word minus its personal, modal, adverbial and case-affixes (if any).
   Disregarding for the moment the occasional nominalizing or verbalizing role of
the affixes (5), we may divide the Squamish stems on the basis of the affixes (4) into
three formal categories: (a) nominalized stems, (b) verbalized stems and (c) unmarked
stems. Nominalized stems contain as their initial part the nominalizer /s-/, e.g.
/s-taq°/ 'water', /s-t'iq 0 / 'cold (noun), cold weather', /s-pcj 'realistic story', /s-qa?q/
'younger sibling'. Verbalized stems contain as their final part an intransitive suffix
/-(V)m(?)/ or one of the transitive suffixes /-(V)t, -s, -(V)n(?), -nsx0/, e.g. /jp'c-m/
'tell, report; itr.', /ta'q°-an/ 'drink; tr.\ Unmarked stems are defined by the absence
of any of these affixes.
   If a stem contains both /s-/ and one of the verbalizers, it is nominal, i.e. the IC's
are /s-/ and the remaining part. Particularly common are nominalized derivatives
with itr. /-(V)m(?)/, e.g. /s-js'c-m/ 'news, report'.
   Nominal stems can be combined with possessive affixes, e.g. /?n-sqa'?q/ 'my /?n-/
younger sibling', verbal stems cannot. Nominal stems are frequently combined with
identificatory clitics (articles) or demonstratives, e.g. /ta w sta'q°/ 'the water', while
verbal stems are frequently combined with predicative clitics, e.g. / n a ^ y a ^ i o ' c m /
64                                    MORPHOLOGY'he is telling, giving a report'; however, both types of clitics are possible with both
types of stems, and this difference in syntactic status is statistical rather than absolute.
   Of the stems belonging to the unmarked class, some have the abovementioned
peculiarities of nominal, others those of verbal stems. Among the nominal stems
there are only a small number that represent the simplest lexical morpheme-type CVC:
/man/ 'father', /tai/ 'canoe-race', /5iX/ 'top', /las/ 'bottom', /k ,0 a57 'dogfish', /x°at/
'wren', /ya 1/ 'unidentified plant', borrowings /puS/ 'cat', /lam/ 'whiskey' (Engl, rum),
/ua51 'watch'; with final glottalized sonants /man?/ 'child, offspring', /5'i?/ 'person
who is fasting', /sau?/ 'bone', /lam?/ 'house', /k>0al?/ 'stomach', /?im?/ 'small boy'.
In the overwhelming majority of cases nominal simplicia are represented by longer
forms, e.g. /naiC/ 'hand, arm', /ma'qsn/ 'nose', /Xa'Su?/ 'lake', /Xqaj£7 'moon',
/ki'lala/ 'butterfly'.
   The remaining unmarked stems are verbal in character; they are intransitive and
occur in general in the same environments as stems marked by intrans. /-(V)m(?)/.
These verbal stems correspond to English verbs, adjectives, adverbs, numerals and
prepositions; they include the large majority of the morpheme-type CVC, and
longer forms are rare here. As examples may serve the stems with /t, t'/ as first and
/k°, k'°, q°, q J 7 as second consonant: /tek'7 'be tight', /taq°/ 'drink', /tiq°/ 'be
muddy', /tiq'7 'bump, run aground', /t'ak0/ 'get stuck in the mud, get mired',
Vt'ak' 0 , t'3k>0 'dig', Vt'aq"", t'aq' 0 'break', /t'uk'7 'go home', /t'iq0/ 'be cold',
/-t'uq0-/ in /s-t>uq°-£-us/ 'forehead' (the suffix-combination /-i-us/, lit. 'back-face',
means by itself 'forehead'; the presence of the nominalizer /s-/ in this combination
implies the verbal nature of /-t'uq0-/). Within this group only one nominal stem
was recorded, namely the reduplicative formation /t3q°-tu'q°/ 'red codfish, red snap-
per'.
   The meanings of unmarked verbs are given as active or passive according as they
occur in recorded phrases or were given by the informants, e.g. /5-n w ta'q7 means
'I /6-nI drink', /5-n_c J 3'h/ means 'I am hit'. There are cases where both are possible
(cf. English ""he reads the book"" and ""the book reads easily""), e.g. /x°i?/ 'be lost',
'be the loser (in a game)', /653tx°/ 'be decorated with carving', 'carve; itr.'.
   In some cases where an unmarked stem was recorded with an English translation
but without examples of use, it is uncertain whether the translation as verb or noun
reflects the true nature of the stem. For example, the meaning of /Xal/ was recorded
as 'a pulling-game with a rope, to see who is strongest'; the word may mean 'tug-of-
war' or 'play tug-of-war', or both.
   Unmarked stems containing affixes of category (5) above may be nominal or verbal,
in the same way as simple stems. When their character in terms of noun or verb is
clearly due to the affix, the latter is classed as nominalizing, resp. verbalizing. Most
affixes are neutral in this respect. For details see 163.
   Within the class of verbal stems, two categories are set off by certain syntactic and
semantic (in part also morphological) peculiarities: these are the numerals and the
relator-verbs, the latter corresponding to English prepositions.
                                     INTRODUCTION                                       65
   There is, in addition, a class of substitutes which includes nominal as well as verbal
stems; this class corresponds to English pronouns and pronominal adverbs.
   Finally, a very small number of stems is set apart as residual; this class contains a
few words corresponding to English adverbs or adverbial phrases, conjunctions and
interjections.
   In addition to full words, Squamish employs a number of clitics. These fall into
two main classes: nominal (identificatory) clitics or articles, and predicative clitics
(a better term might be ""factual clitics""), the latter indicating person, tense, mood,
aspect and other features of predicative expressions (main and subordinate). The
modal and adverbial suffixes (category (2) above) can be attached to predicative
clitics and are often found within strings of the latter, so that it is convenient to treat
these two categories together.
   In describing Squamish morphology, we treat first the various types of affixation
(nominalizer, verbalizers, personal affixes, non-personal affixes) and reduplication.
The distinction noun-verb is made, where necessary, within each affixal or re-
duplicative category. For reasons of expediency, reduplication is treated before
non-personal affixation; this requires fewer references ahead. — Thereafter are treated
the case-forms, the articles, the substitutes, the special verb-classes (numerals,
relator-verbs), the predicative clitics together with the modal and adverbial suffixes,
and the residual words.

                                  THE NOMINALIZER /a-/
80. The nominalizer /s-/ occurs in a large number of fixed combinations with un-
marked stems as well as with intransitive (seldom transitive) derivatives. Examples:
/taq°/       'to drink'                        /s-taq°/       'water'
/t'iq0/      'be cold'                         /s-t'iq0/      '(the) cold'
/XucV        'be scabby'                       /s-XucV        'scabies'
A'i?/        'be dear'                         /s-X'i?/       'desire, thing wanted'
/c'ic'a'p7   'to work'                         /s-c'ic'a'pV   '(the) work, job'
/tan?-t/     'weave; tr.'                      /s-Xan?/       'mat, woven fabric'
/t'mS-a'n/   'braid; tr.'                       /s-t'amS/     '(a) braid'  Examples with intransitive derivatives:
/ia'c-m/      'to tell*                         /s-ia'c-m/    'news'
   (cf. /s-jac/ 'story')
/pah-i'm?/ 'to blow' (wind)                     /s-pah-i'm?/ '(the) wind'
   (cf. /puh-t/ 'blow; tr.)
/tV-im?/ 'dig; itr.'                           /s-t'k'Mm?/ 'pit, dugout'
   (cf. /t'a'k^-an/ 'dig; tr.')  In a number of cases the root was not recorded without intransitive suffix:
/ni'Sim/   'speak; itr.'                        /s-ni'Cim/   'speech, word, language'
/Xi'c'mI   'spark; itr.'                        /s-Xi'c'm/   '(a) spark'
/p'u'X'amI 'smoke; itr.'                        /s-p'u'X'am/ '(the) smoke'
/t'lq^'m?/ 'nurse, take the breast'             /s-t'lq^'m?/ 'breast'  A fixed nominalization of a trans, derivative (root not recorded without tr. suffix):
/5a'§-nI     'send; tr.'                       /s-Sa'S-n/     'messenger'  In a number of cases no counterparts without /s-/ were recorded, e.g. /smic/
                                  THE NOMINALIZER /s-/                                    67meat', /sX,iq°/ 'flesh', /sqalX/ 'stick for digging clams', /sC'alq's/ 'slingshot', /sX,i'Sm/
'twisted cedar-leaves of which rope is made'. In general, any stem of the type
/sCVC.../ may be regarded as an /s-/ derivative of a stem /CVC.../, except, of course,
for cases where /s/ belongs to the root and a suffix /-VC.../ is involved, as in /sq'-im?/
'split wood; itr.', where the root is /sq'-/> cf. /saq'/ 'crack, split lengthwise; itr.', in
this example combined with the active-intrans. suffix /-im?/.
   In a few cases forms with and without /s-/ occur side by side, e.g. /(s-)tqa'ia?/
'wolf', /(s-)c'na'i?/ 'bullhead', /(s-)5'iu'i/ 'twins'. The words /s-taj?6/ 'back' and
/s-?a'cus/ 'face' may be used with and without /s-/ when they refer to the back, resp.
front, of a house, and not to parts of the body. Note /k°ci?c/ 'person with magic
power' versus /s-k°ci?c/ 'relative'.","[59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]"
"                          Proximal — Distal. Independent Forms198. Within the present strong category there is an opposition proximal-distal which
parallels English 'this' vs. 'that'. The two may be opposed in stressed use only so
that this opposition belongs to the demonstrative substitutes (202) rather than to the
articles; however, both proximal and distal forms are used as articles (see 197). And
even stressed I can oppose the two in independent use only: /ti1 Pi1 ta'j.?/ 'this
one and that one'; dependently, only /ta'j?, ?a'A,i/ are represented in my notes:
/sua't ta'i? sui'Pqa/ 'who is that man?', /sua't Pa'Xi sXa'nai?/ 'who is that
woman?'. The independent proximal form is usually extended with an element
/-ua/: /ta'i? Pi ti'ua Pi ci'ua/'that one and this one and this one'(pointing to
three children, the third one a girl). The non-present does not distinguish proximal
and distal forms: /ha'?A, w ?u ti'ua/ 'is this (present) one good?', /ha'PX^Pu ta'i?/
'is that (present) one good?', / h a ' ? k w ? u k°a'ci/ 'is it (absent) good?', 'is this/that
(absent) one good?'.

to expressions referring to human or animal females (LM used it occasionally also
with the word /snax°i 'A./ 'canoe' and with other words for vehicles and containers,
but said that older people did not; this usage may be a result of the influence of
English): / t a ^ m m a ' n , k^a^nrma'n/, etc., 'my father* versus ¡Kawn-6i'5a?,
k°A.as_n-6ilsa?/, etc., 'my mother'; /ti^nrma'n?/ 'my son (here), /ci w nTm3'n?/ 'my

200. The Squamish substitutes include nominal as well as verbal elements. Some of
them correspond to English pronouns and pronominal adverbs, while others have no
exact parallels in English (e.g. the verb 'to do what?'). The substitutes are divided
into eleven formal categories, which may be roughly labeled as follows: 1. personal
substitutes (201), 2. demonstratives (202), 3. anaphoric element (203), 4-5. determina-
tive substitutes (204-205), 6. possessive substitute (206), 7-8. indefinite substitutes
(207-208), 9-11. interrogative substitutes (209-211).
   The nature of these elements entails certain syntactic peculiarities which it is
difficult to state explicitly and exhaustively. Rather than burden the syntax with a
number of laborious statements (which would not be exhaustive), I have preferred to
give some general indications here (reference to which is made in the Syntax), and to
quote examples of use with each of the categories treated below.
   Of nominal character are the personal, demonstrative and possessive substitutes,
the determinative substitute /mani'X,/ 'self' and the interrogative substitutes /s-yat/
'who' and /s-tam/ 'what'. Of these, the demonstratives cannot be preceded by an
article, and the use of articles with /s-uat, s-tam/ is limited to two examples. On
the other hand, only the possessive substitute can (and even must) be used with
possessive affixes. Of verbal character are the determinative substitute /PiPi0/ 'all'
and the interrogative substitutes /Pa'nia/ 'be which' and /6a-/ 'do what'. The in-
definite substitutes combine the characteristics of nouns and verbs; note that in the
absence of the criterion of combinability with possessive affixes the difference
noun-verb is statistical rather than absolute (see 79).","[140, 141, 142]"
"
                                       A. PREFIXES                                     The Prefix /Pas-/164. The prefix /Pas-/, added to unmarked (often reduplicated) stems, has the general
meaning 'one which X-es' or 'one which is X-ed'. It can often be translated by an
English participle or adjective, e.g. /taX°/ 'be settled', /Pas-ts'-tX0/ 'correct, right'
(/5-x°v_uaw?3St3ltX°/ 'you are right'), /lix0/ 'fall down (from a standing position)',
/?asTlii-l?x0/ 'lying, prostrate'; /saq'/ 'crack, split', /?a(s)-s3lqV 'half', /Pa(s)-sa'-sq'/
'cracked, split'. Where the underlying stem by itself denotes a quality, /Pas-/ serves
to ""objectify"" it in a general, abstract way, e.g. /hii1/ 'be big', /?as-(h)ii'/ 'one which
is big' (/ta w ?as-(h)ii' Pn-sVi1?/ 'I want the big one', lit. 'the one which is big is my
desire'; in the same way /ta^Pas-Paci'm/ 'the small one'). The difference with the
nominalizer /s-/ is that the latter nominalizes in a particular, concrete way and
connotes objects or materials with all their inherent attributes, whereas the /Pas-/ form
refers to the single attribute indicated by the stem. The two are not far apart, and /s-/
is undoubtedly a reduced form of /Pas-/ (which itself is a reduced form of the 3rd person
clitic /Pas/).
   The meanings of these forms cannot always be mechanically derived from those of
the underlying stems, especially not when the latter have a nominal character, cf.
/qa'nax 0 / 'neck, throat', /?as-qa'nax°/ 'overeaten', lit. 'throttled'; /iua's/ 'wife',
/Pas-£ua's/ 'married (ab. a man)'.
   The /Pas-/ forms stand midway between nouns and verbs. Like nouns, they
frequently take articles, but unlike nouns, they do not take possessive affixes (see 206).
Like verbs, they are frequently combined with predicative clitics. Sometimes the
meaning of an /Pas-/ form was given as a verb, e.g. /PasTma'n?/ 'give birth' (with
predicative clitics /na^ua^Pss-ma'n?/ 'she is giving birth') or as an adjective (which
corresponds to a verb in Squamish), e.g. /Pas-q>0u'i/ 'sick' (/ua^Pas-q^u'j/ 'he is
sick'). In other cases the meaning was given as a noun, e.g. /Pas-t'a'-t'k' 0 / 'hole, pit,
well'(with an article/na w x°i l tim tx^t'a'x 0 t-ta^Pas-t'a'-t'k' 0 /'he jumped out of
the pit'). I quote meanings of /Pas-/ forms as given by the informants or required
by examples.
   In several instances derivations with /Pas-/ have objective besides qualitative
meanings, e.g. /?as-q°al-q°a?/ 'perforated, pierced', also 'hole'. In a few cases /?as-/
112                                   MORPHOLOGYand /s-/ derivatives stand side by side: /Pas-t'aX-t'X-a'Cx0/ 'many-limbed, branchy'
and /s-t'X-a5x°/ 'limb (of a tree)', plur. /s-t'aX-t'X-a'&c0/ (see 146); /Pas-qV-q^P-qs/
'having a perforated nose' and /s-q°a-qs/ 'hole trought the nose', /Pas-q'a'-q^u?/
'accompanying, together with' and /s-q>0u?, s-qV-q^u?/ 'companion', /Pas-na't/
'nocturnal' and /s-nat/ 'night', /Pas-C'q^a'p/ 'having the hair tied up in Indian
fashion' and /s-C'q>0ap/ 'feather in the hair'. The instances where the meaning of an
/Pas-/ derivative was given as a noun concern particularly cases where shapes are
involved: /Pas-p'aq0/ 'slab', /PasTina'-mPk0/ 'lump', /Pas-ca'm-cntfq0/ 'wrinkles', cf. for
the first of these examples /mi'-ka ?3lx°a?-t-c k'i^Pas-p'a'q""/ 'come on, give
/?3'x°a?t/ me /-c/ a slab', where the meaning 'a slab' is a narrowing (concretization)
of 'one which has been made into a slab' or 'one which has assumed the shape
of a slab'. Compare such English nouns as ""a perforation"", ""a swelling"", etc.
   Due to the fact that word-initial /?-/ is easily dropped, some of the complexes
with /Pas-/ were also recorded with /s-/; on the other hand, nouns like /s-taq°/ 'water'
are never pronounced with /Pas-/. It is probable that my material contains some
forms with /s-/ which represent incidentally reduced /Pas-/ forms.
   All /Pas-/ derivatives which were recorded are summed up below, categorized
according to the shape of the stem. (Excepted are only cases of the type /ta w ?as-(h)ii'/
'the big one' (see above); these are in principle possible with any stem with qualitative
meaning, though only a few were recorded). At the end of each group, I add those
recorded /s-/ forms which semantically and syntactically so closely resemble /Pas-/
derivatives that they probably represent incidental reductions of the latter.","[111, 112]"
"81. Besides occurring in fixed combinations referring to objects, i.e. in nouns, the
nominalizer /s-/ may as a result of a living grammatical procedure be combined with
any verbal stem (and also with certain predicative clitics) to refer to a fact. In the
most frequent type of case, such a nominalized verb-form is accompanied by a
possessive affix, and the whole expression takes the indefinite article /k°i/, e.g.
/k°iwn-STnil5im/ 'the fact of my /n-/ speaking', 'that I speak', /k^^n-Srna'm?/ 'the
fact of my going', 'that I go'. Note that there is a noun /s-ni'Cim/ 'word, speech,
language' (/ta^n-Srni'iim/ 'my word, speech, language', with the definite article /ta/);
on the other hand, there is no noun */s-nam?/. For this use of /s-/ see 133, 135.

82. Unmarked stems are transitivized by the addition of suffixes characterized by a
final /-t/, /-s/, /-n/ or /-nax 0 /. Both unmarked and transitivized stems may be followed
by an intransitive suffix characterized by a final /-m/. An unmarked stem with an
intrans. suffix yields an intransitive (often reflexive) verb. A transitive stem followed
by an intrans. suffix yields a passive form.
   The suffixes with /-n, -m/ also appear with /-n?, -m?/, depending on the stem t o
which they are added (see 72).
   Of the abovementioned suffixes, those with /-t, -n, -m/ may either consist of a
single consonant or have the shape /-VC/, i.e. they may include a vowel. This vowel
is often — but by no means always — identical with the (last) vowel of the stem t o
which the suffix is added. There is, in addition, an intrans. suffix /-im?/, always
with /i/ and glottal stop, which carries the meaning 'active, non-reflexive intransitive'
(""be busy cleaning"", "" b e throwing punches"", etc.).
   The suffixes /-s/ and /-(V)n/ are extended with an element /-t-/ if other suffixes
(for object or subject, or itr. /-m/) are added.
   The suffix /-nax°/ has the form /-n-/ when an object-suffix or itr. /-m/ follows (it

In the few cases where /t/- and /n/-forms occur of the same root, the former refers
to an action which affects its object as a whole, the latter to one which affects it
partially or superficially, cf. /Xi°-\xt/ 'spit (something) out' vs. /ta'jf-n/ 'spit (at
someone)', /q°a-t/ 'save, rescue (someone)', lit. 'pull through', w. /q°a-n/ 'perforate
(something)'; originally also /cu-t/ 'say (something)' vj. /cu-n/ 'tell, order (someone)
(for /cut/ see 85). The distinction is not productive; from a synchronic point of view
the suffixes /-(V)t/ and /-(V)n/ may be regarded as non-automatic allomorphs of one
transitivizer.
   The /s/-form is causative; the suffix /-s/ does not occur with all stems, but within
certain groups of cases it is productive (see 91).
   The /n3x°/-form refers to a process viewed as independent of the will of the actor;
it either denotes an act which is accidental, or it refers to a state of affairs which
results from an action (voluntary or not) and the existence or maintenance of which
does not require an act of the will. Examples: unmarked form /i-n^ca'x 0 / 'I /6-n/
am (have been) hit (with something thrown)', /n/-form /5-n w c3 l x°-n/ '1 hit him (with
something thrown)' (on purpose), /n3x°/-form /5-n w c3 l x°Tn3x7 'I hit him (acciden-
tally)', 'I have hit him'; /t/-form /5-n w p'i'?-t/ 'I grabbed it', /n 3 x 0 /-form /{-n^p'i 1 ?-
nax°/ 'I am holding it', 'I have caught it', 'I got it' (note that the seizure was an act
of the will, the resulting holding or having is not); /fc-n^q^u'P-t/ 'I included him,
put him into the group (on purpose)', versus /£-n w ,q > °u l ?-nax7 'I got him into it
(accidentally)', 'I have included him'. One says /5-n w ua w 5'a l u-at-umi/ 'I am
helping you /-umi/' (/ua/ 'imperfective-continuous') but / n w a u w 6 - n w u a ^ 5 > a l u » n -
umi/ 'am I helping you?', 'am I of (any) assistance to you?' ( / n w a u w / introduces
the question, /-nax0/ has the alternant /-n-/ before the object-suffix /-umi/); the
speaker may have the best intentions, but the answer to his question is independent
of these intentions.
   The /n3x°/-form is a productive non-volitional counterpart of the volitional /t/-
and /n/-transitives; it occurs also as a counterpart of a few causative verbs (see 102).","[67, 68, 69]"

188. Nominal expressions can appear in two case-forms, Absolutive and Relative.
The Absolutive case receives no indication. The Relative case is marked by a
prefix ¡t-/. This prefix is added either to the article which precedes a nominal form,
or to a demonstrative substitute. Thus, to the absolutive (zero-) forms of the articles
/ta, k°a/, etc. (see 189), there are opposed the relative forms /t-ta, t-k°a/, etc., and to
the absolutive demonstratives /taj?/ 'that one', /?i'ci 2 uit/ 'those, they', etc. (see 202),
the relative forms /t-ta 'i?, t-?i'ci 2 uit/, etc.
   The relative prefix /t-/ easily merges with the initial /t/ of a deictic element (see 41),
in which case the relative form becomes indistinguishable from the absolutive. Only
with proper names and personal pronouns the articles /ta, \aj have a special relative
form A'a/, e.g. /na 1 ? X'a^Pa'lqsn/ 'on, at /na?/ Point Grey' vs. /na 1 ? t - t a w
sma'nit/ 'on the mountain', /ma'Cn X'a^Qa'lqalik/ 'QalqaliX's lice'.
   The Absolutive is the case of the subject, and also of the direct object of a transitive
verb; other relata appear in the Relative case (see 244-248).

189. Squamish employs a number of identifying and deictic elements which occur as
clitics before nominal expressions; some of them (the ""strong"" forms) can also occur
independently. They correspond roughly to English indef. and def. articles and
demonstrative pronouns. These elements are here summed up in a chart which shows
the oppositions existing in the deictic system :                                    DEFINITE

                 as relatum of relator-verb (271).
 c. /k°3-k°i 'n?/ 'long (ago) time', a partial reduplication (150) of a \/k 0 in(?) not
                 recorded by itself; the glottalization in /k°3-k°i 'n?/ may be due to
                 reduplication (71 sub (3)). The phrase /na 1 ? tk 0 i^k°3k°i'n?/ is a
                 sentence-adjunct and as such may precede the predicate-expression which
                 follows (244).
 d. / u a w i a ' - n ? - t - m / 'he (they) used to be warned'; V i u h , jah 'be careful', here in
                 zero-grade (57), with /ph/ reduced to /¿a-/ (18) before the transitivizer
                 /-n?/ (82, 93), the tr. form being passivized by the itr. suffix /-m/, before
                 which the tr. suffix is extended with /-t-/ (82). The form is preceded by
                 the predicative clitic /ua/ (continuous-iterative; 228). A plural-suffix
                 /-uit/ is lacking; the expression of the plural is not obligatory and is
                  particularly often lacking when the subject immediately follows (123).
 e. /ta w s-ta l u?x°X/ 'the children', pronounced [ t a s t a ' P o x ^ ] (26), a noun marked
                 by the nominalizer /s-/ (80). It is used in a collective sense — as can be
                  done with any n o u n — t h o u g h there is a reduplicated plural /s-tu-ta 'u?x°X/
                 (146). The weak present article /ta/ is used because the referent is unique
                 and not ""absent"" in a deictic sense (197).
 f. /iu'ia's-uit/ 'that they should be careful', a 3rd pers. /-as/ plur. /-uit/ form of
                 the hypothetical paradigm (132) based on the full grade of V i u h , ¿ah
                 (see I:Id), here shortened before the junctural glottalization (69 sub d.).
                  Syntactically the form represents a zero-clause (321).
 g. /ha'u q ^ u ^ P a s ^ p ' i ' P - t - a ' s - u i t / 'not for them to take', the part /p'i'Pta'suit/
                 a 3rd pers. plur. form of tr. /p'iP-t/ 'seize, take' (89); for v V i ? see 62.
                 The form is negated by /hay/ (256) followed by a /q/-clause of type I l l b
                 (301), a negative statement being expressed 'it is not the case /hau/ as if
                 /qI ...'. The clitic /ua/, appearing as /u/ before /Pas/ (56 sub (/)) can
                 refer to the future in the same way as the present progressive form in
                 English. /Pas/ is the 3rd pers. clitic (221). I cannot say whether the whole
                 clause depends on / u a ^ j a ' n P t m / or on /¿u l2 a'suit/.
 h. /k°i v _^sta l m/ 'anything' (after a negative predicate); cf. /stam/ 'what?' (209),
                 with indef. article /k°i/ (190).
 i. /ti-na 1 ?/ '(be) f r o m ' ; relator-verb consisting of the root /na?/ 'be on, at' and the
                 prefix /ti-/ 'from' (179:6).

 k. /ha'u q s _,u_Pas s _Xq > i l P-s-t-a l s-uit/ '(one) whom they would not know'; same
                 formation as /hau/-phrase above, but here a form of the nominal
                 paradigm (130; cf. also 134) used independently and hence preceded by
                 an article.—jhq'i 'P-s/ is a causative verb of which no simplex occurs (91);

            (suff. /-uiX, -uX/ 'container, canoe'). Also recorded with glottalization:
            /?a'i 2 tx 0 /. The clitic /ua/ here used in its ""continuous"" meaning (cf. I:ld).

            use of the strong form of the article see 197.
 c. /uaX/ general conjunction 'and, while', etc. see 358.
 d. /na w ya^X3-X3h-a'm-uit/ 'they were crying'; a partial reduplication (156) of
            /Xah-m, Xa-m/, an itr. derivative (108) of a \/X3h. — /na/ 'there, then'
             (225,   328).3a. /na^mPi^Pu'is/ 'she came in'; clitic /m?i/ 'come (234, 334). — /?ujs/ is
             originally bimorphemic, cf. /Pu'J-uA,/ 'put aboard', and is to /?ajs/ 'be
             inside' (cf. 1:2b) what /?ucq/ 'go outside' is to /?acq/ 'outside' (78).
 b. /k 0 3W w hii' s-Xa'n-aj?/ 'a big woman'. — /k°aXi/ is the feminine counterpart of
             /k°3ci/ (1: 2b); /hii'/ 'big' attributive adjunct (259) to /s-Xa. 'n-ai?/ 'woman',
             a nominalized derivative of \A.an, Xan(?) 'weave'; for /-ai?/ see comments
             in Dictionary under /-ai?/6.
 c. /Cm-CmPa'P-s-t-as/ 'she carried on her back', a totally reduplicated (151)
             causative (91) derivative of /5m?a'?/ 'carry a load; itr.', probably contain-
             ing V&>m(?) 'close, be folded' and the formative /-a?/ (187:30). For /-t-/
             see I:ld, k; for /-as/ I:If, g, k. Note that the form is finite and not
             nominal — the two are formally identical, but the nominal form would
             mean 'which she carried' and would be an appositive adjunct (260) to a
             preceding noun (such is the case with /nawA,>ilu?.n3x°as/ in 1:17a). A
             second, coordinated finite form in a sentence is usually without deictic
             clitics (360).
 d. /si'tn/ 'basket (generic)'; undoubtedly contains the implement-suffix /-tn/ (186:5).
             The type of basket which is carried on the back has the special name
             /c'u'PmaSn/.4a. /ha'u q w .?as w ^,q > i l ?-s-t-as/ 'they didn't know (it)'; differs from 1:1k by the
           absence of /u(a)/ because the form refers to the past (299), and by the
           absence of /-uit/ because the subject /stau?x°X/ follows immediately
           (I: Id, e).
 b. /k°iws-ni'X,-s Qa'lqaliX,/ 'that it was Q.'; /niX/ combines the functions of ana-
           phoric pronoun and copula (203, 252), and is here embedded in a
           /k°i/-clause (281; 275), with the nominalizer /s-/ and the 3rd pers.
           possessive suffix /-s/ (133). A proper name as a predicate lacks an
           article (266).5a. / s - s w m n w c u l t / 'then she said'; /cu-t/ contains the transitivizer /-t/ (cf. /cu-n/
               'tell, order someone', see 83) but, like other verbs referring to the
               production of sounds (55), is treated as an itr. verb: it lacks the 3rd pers.

             an /Pas-/ derivative (164) based on \/£a(?) 'be, act', the passive /Ca'-n-m/
             of which serves as an interrogative substitute 'do what?', 'go where?'
             (211; see particularly last paragraph). — The clitic /5-/ goes back to the

  b. /(t-)ta w su'k >0 am/ 'cedar-bark'; the material is referred to as such, hence the
             present article /ta/ (196). The expression is in the relative case (270,
              3rd paragraph), but the relative case prefix often coalesces with an article
             beginning with /t/ (41). In doubtful cases one has to elicit corresponding
             forms with non-present articles beginning with /k% before which /t-/
             is always clearly audible. 7a. /s-s^mn^n-q'i'-q'l-s-t-as/ 'then she fooled them'; for /s-s w mn/ see 1:5a, for

           prefix /nax°-/ (169jf.) as found in lexicalized combinations before cons,
           proper; in this word no meaning can be ascribed to it (177). Word-
           initial /nqV is pronounced [naq'] (48). 8a. /?aXiwmani'X, Q./ The addition of /mani'X,/ 'self' (204) to the phrase 1:5b is
              reminiscent of the use of sam in the Russian byliny. ""sam Suxmantij
             prigovarival""; the substitute can be used without proper name (e.g. 1:25,
              111:18), just as in sam govorit takovo slovo.

             /sa't-sit/ 'give to; tr.' (object destinee; see 103, 104), /sa't-q°ujl?a5-il?m/
             'give one's finger' (IV: 20).

10a. /q'ap'-aS-i'Pn-t-m/ passive (cf. I:ld) of /q'ap'-afi-i'Pn/ 'catch someone by the
              hand /-a5/, trans. /-i?n/'; for the formation see 180; /-&£/ belongs to the
              suffixes that require the tr. suffix /-i?n/ (181).
  b. / V a ^ Q . / relative form of the article (188); the construction pass, verb + noun
              in relative case is a free alternative of active tr. verb + subject in
              absolutive case (247).
  c. /c3'x°-s-t-as/ for the suffixes cf. 1:1k, 3c, 7a; /cax°/ 'get hit', /cax°-n/ 'throw at;
              tr.', /cax°-s/ 'throw; tr.' (83).
  d. /tx°Tnu?/ relator-verb 'move into', derived with /tx°-/ (directional; 168, 178)
              from the Vniu?. nsu?, nu? 'be inside'. For the alternative forms of the
              zero-grade see 32,34. Syntactically the word is a verbal secondary
              relatum of /ca'x°stas/ and corresponds to an English preposition (273).
  e. /t-ta w si'tn/ nominal secondary relatum of /tx°.nu'?/ (271), cf. I:lb, j.
  f. /Pas-q'a-q'V? t a _ T . / 'T. being together (with them)'. Relator-verb (219, 220)
              consisting of an /Pas-/ derivative (164) of a partial reduplication (156,
              166) of a \/q J au(P), q'aui?), q>0uP, with automatic labialization in the

  b. /Pas-nPi'u?/ 'being inside' (relator-verb), an /Pas-/ derivative (164) of the root
              quoted in I:10d. The origin of the glottalization in /n?/ is problematic,
              see 73. — /PasnPi'u? ta w sta'u?x c X/ is a relative independent adjunct to
              /ta w si'tns/, see 264.13a. /Xi'C'-it-m/. The root /Xi57 'be cut' has a counterpart with /a/ in /Xa'S'-tn/
                'knife' (78 sub (4)); it is transitivized by /-it/ (89) and passivized by
                /-ml (82). For the construction see 1:10b.
  b. / P i w k ° w n a w m n ^ / . This combination of clitics expresses the meaning
                'until he ...', cf. / P i ^ k ^ C - n ^ m n ^ / 'until I ...' (351, 356).
  c. / w q 0 a'-nax 0 -as/ 3rd pers. subject /-as/ of /-n3x°/-form ('have done'; 83,102) of

  d. /Pas-X'a'-Vm/ 'fitting, sufficient', an /Pas-/ derivative (see 1:5c, lOf, 12b) of a
                reduplicated root (166). Though formally a partial red., it is probable
                that /-m/ is the itr. suffix, and that /V(a)/ is a contracted form of /Xah?/
                'be touched', cf. 78 sub (2), also the pair /XauP, k'iu?/ sub (4).
  e. /k 0 i w s-£aX,q°-a l n-t-as/ a /k°i/-clause (see 1:4b) with a factual form (133) of

                   The complex /s-Paj^qs/ by itself means                             'promontory'.         'Elbow'     is

                   /ci'x°i tk°sci/, in which case /cix°/ is extended with the inchoative suffix
                   (-i(?)/ (186:34);          it then lacks a transitivizer and requires the rel. case in a

                   refer to animals and total reduplication for humans (see 213, 143,                               144).

              cf. I:21a. In this case, /mi / was recorded with a stress of its own (though
              without /?/), which gives it the status of main verb; without stress it
              would be a predicative clitic with /tut.n3x°S,i't/; see 274 for clitics going

             one can translate 'the fire was already big', 'was big now', 'had become
             big'.
27a. /n-q'aty 'be in the way', pronounced [naq5-, naeq'-] (48). /n-/ is the alternant of
            /nax°-/ (169) before cons, proper in lexicalized complexes (175). Cf. the

            'put in the way', /n-q'a'XTnax0/ 'run into', lit. 'put in the way accidentally'.
            — The unmarked form is as such intrans. and requires the rel. case in a

   Of the Salish languages, only a few have received more or less extensive treatments
(overall or partial) in recent times: Halcomelem (Elmendorf-Suttles 1960: Vocabu-
lary), Snoqualmie-Duwamish (Tweddell 1950: Phonology, Morphology), Upper
Chehalis (Kinkade 1963-64: Phonology, Morphology), Kalispel (Vogt 1940: Gram-
mar, Texts, Dictionary), Coeur d'Alene (Reichard 1938: Grammar; 1939: Stem-List).
For others only sketchy and/or older data are available (see Bibliography).
   A sketch of Squamish was published by Hill-Tout as part of an interesting ethno-
graphical description.9 This material has to be used with caution because of an
inadequate and inconsistent notation and various other defects. Nevertheless, it
has not lost its value: Hill-Tout's word-list proved useful as a starting-point in ob-
taining lexical items, his phrases contain valuable syntactic material, and in individual
cases his data make it possible to establish an older, fuller word-form than was
recorded half a century later.
   The material on which the present description is based was collected in the years
1951-54 and in the fall of 1956. — During the first of these periods I was on the
staff of the Department of Slavonic Studies of the University of British Columbia
in Vancouver. My informants were first Mr. Isaac Jacob (1883-1956): in the text
referred to as ""IJ"") of Capilano Reserve, and later Mr. Alex Peters, known as ""Alec
Peter"" (1881-1964; referred to as ""AP"") of Musqueam Reserve. Mr. Peters knew
Musqueam besides Squamish. The working-sessions were held at the homes of
the informants, and occasionally Mrs. Jacob and Mrs. Peters would make comments
or volunteer information. During this period a fairly large number of words, short
phrases and sentences were collected, and outlines of phonology and morphology
were worked out. Much remained problematic; also, I was unable to obtain longer
connected texts. — In the fall of 1956 I returned to Vancouver for a short period,
in which I had the good fortune of being able to engage the services of Mr. Louis
Miranda (born 1892; referred to as ""LM"") of Mission Indian Reserve. Mr. Miranda,
an exceptionally alert informant, was of great assistance in checking and clearing
up a number of difficult points. He was furthermore able to dictate texts, which
in turn provided additional lexical and grammatical material. Translations and a
rapid analysis of these texts were made while I could still dispose of Mr. Miranda's
invaluable cooperation.
   The material thus obtained was further analysed and classified after my return
to Holland. To many questions which arose during the work answers could be
found in the available corpus. In a few cases alternative solutions had to be given
(the choice depending on Squamish forms not represented in the material). Some
questions had to remain open. In such cases I have preferred stating the problem' See Swadesh 1953:28.

of which I dispose; on matters that are not treated (e.g. sentence-intonation, the
expression of ordinal numbers) data are lacking. The categorization of the material
is based primarily on formal criteria. Except in trivial cases, all available examples
of a given category are quoted (e.g. of a particular type of transitive verb or sub-
ordinate clause). In the Dictionary internal and external etymologies are given,
the latter take into account only those languages for which more or less extensive
word- or stem-lists are available (for details see p. 245f.). A number of uncertain
comparisons are included (marked ""Cf.?""); here additional data may show whether
the question-mark or the comparison itself has to be dropped.","[8, 9, 10]"
"                                         Weak — Strong
197. The opposition weak-strong roughly parallels that between English article and
demonstrative pronoun, except that the Squamish ""strong"" forms can also occur as
140                                       MORPHOLOGYclitics, and in these cases English would have an article or zero (see below). As in
English, the weak forms, which merely identify, cannot be used independently; the
strong ones, which are deictic in the narrower sense, can be used by themselves.
   The weak forms are used in the first place with unique objects, including proper
names: /ta w n*m3'n?, k°a w nTm3'n?/ 'my son; pres., abs.\ /ta_sn3'q°m/ 'the sun',
/na1? t-k°a_?a'iaX,q7 'down below', /na'? t-k°a w 5i'Sm/ 'higher up', /PasnPi'u?
t-k°a w ,k >0 a'x°a?/ 'in the box' (the addressee knows the box, and the box is in another
room), /na w ?a'n5a k c Xa^5i'Sa?/ 'where is (your) mother?', /ta w Ta'm, k°a^Ta'm/
'Tom', also with personel pronouns: /ta_?a'ns/ 'I', / t a w n a ' u / 'thou', / t a w n i ' m a V
'we', /ta^na'u-jap/ 'you, pi.'. In the second place, the weak form /ta/ can be used
for non-unique referents which have been mentioned before and therefore are readily
identified; this usage requires a previous reference with a strong form.
   The strong form /ti/ is very often used with nouns which have a 1st pers. possessive
prefix, but only if the object referred to is close by: /ti w n-sq°ma'i?/ 'my dog here',
/ti^nrlam?/ 'my house' (said inside it by the owner), /ti w n-s?a'cus/ 'my face'.
   In telling stories, LM very often uses the strong form /Pa^i/ (instead of /k°aXi/ or
/Xa/), whereas the corresponding masc. form /taj?/ is not used as a clitic at all, but
only as a (stressed) demonstrative.
   The strong form /k°oci/ is used when new things or persons are introduced in a
story or report, cf. / n a w m ? i ^ ? u ' i s k°aX.iwhii' sXa'nai?/ 'a big woman came
in' (1:3), /na1? t-k 0 3ci^n5 5 u'? na'tX/ 'one morning', 'on a certain morning' (IV: 1),
/ n a ^ k ^ c u ' t k ^ c i ^ ' n S ' u ' P sta'l.max0/ 'one Indian said ...' (IV:9) (cf. the usage
in American slang ""suddenly this cop appears from nowhere and gives us a ticket"").
One says /na^C'a'mP-t-as k°3ci^sui'?qa/ 'he has bitten a man', reporting on a dog
that has misbehaved.
   For independent use of the strong forms see the next section.","[139, 140]"
"
                                D. NOMINAL VERB-FORMS323. Verb-forms of the nominal paradigm (130) are used in exactly the same way as
nouns; for examples of use as independent nominal expressions see 258, as attributive
adjuncts see 259, as appositive adjuncts see 260. Here follow additional examples of
use as subject or object: /£a'int-as k°9A,i^na w na'nam?/ 'he chased her who was
traveling' (111:15), /s-s w mn w t3?a'u?n-uit qi'-as k 0 3ci w na w ta'q°ant-as-uit/ 'then
they supposed that that which they had drunk was bad' (IV: 31), / t a _ u a ^ X , - s ^
na'nam? k^Xi^na^ua^CiSa'jPst-as/ 'where she was traveling, the one he was
pursuing' (111:16). The forms under discussion are particularly common as subjects
with predicates containing substitutes or numerical expressions: /sta'm k 0 i^_na w
k>°al5.n9x°-ax°/ 'what did you see?', /sta'm t a ^ n a ^ u a ^ P i ' p ' i s t - a s / 'what has he
got there?', lit. 'what is that which he is holding?', /sta'm k°i^_sa'tsit-as/ 'what will
he give him?', /k'°in k°i^na, w ,p > i l ?n3x°-ax7 'how many did you catch?', /k'°in
k°iw n a ^ u a ^ t a 'Pst-ax0/ 'how many are you making?', /qs'X k°a_,na w ma '¿.n3x°-an/
'I've forgotten much', /k>0i'n k°i^ta'Pst-ax 0 / 'just make a few', /k^i'minut k ° i ^ ? i _
XJi'qst-ax°/ 'how many pieces (items) did you bring here?', /XaPu'cnrmut
k°i^Xi't > it-ax 0 / 'divide it into four', /k > °i'n w Paq > k ^ t a 'Pst-ax0/ or /k'°in k ° i _
ta'?st-ax c w PaqV 'you'll make a few', /sua't k°i w/ ua s _ / na'nt-m t-k°i_,Pi'ta/ 'who is
the one called Peter?',/sua't X'a^na'u-jap k ° i _ n a w t a ' ? s ti 1 /'which one of you made
this?'. A nominal trans, verb-form referring to the subject (as in the last example)
and with an object-suffix: /sua't k°i^na^_q°3ha [ ia?ni [ ?nt-umi/ 'who (is the one that)
pierced your ears?'. — Here also belong the heads of expressions with predicative
independent adjuncts (see 265), e.g. /k°3ci w cu'nt-as-uit sk°ca'Ps/ 'that which they
thought to be an island' (IV:6; cf. also the other examples given in 265).
    Examples of use without article (see 268): /Pa'ns n a w t a ' ? s / 'it's me who made it',
/ni'A, ta'j? na^q°3ha'ia?ni?n/ 'it is he there who pierced her ears', /mani'X,
?aA,iv_^nawua,w5i£a'i?st-as n a ^ c u ' n / 'it was she, the one he was persuing, herself,
who told him' (111:26), /Pi'ta na^k'a'£.n3x°-as t a w T a ' m / 'it is Peter who saw
Tom', /tx°(h)u'i na^Pi'p'ist-an/ 'it's all I've left'.
   Notice that in the case of predicative independent adjuncts (265), e.g. / t i w n a w
ua^cu'ntm na w ua w Aa?4i'?uty 'this one they thought (lit. 'who was thought) to be
eating fire' (IV: 11) the adjunct consists of a form of the finite and not of the nominal
paradigm (the two are formally identical): the form refers to a fact (that he was
eating fire) and not to an object (one who is eating fire). A noun in the same position
202                                          SYNTAXplays the role of a subordinate nominal predicate: /ti^cu'ntas sk°ca'?s/ 'this which
he thought to be an island' (IV: 2); the man did not dream up an object (island) but
thought a fact (its being an island). When the quotational expression itself is used
predicatively, alternative constructions with adjuncts and with /k°i/-clauses are
possible: /?n-sq°a'luan na_,k° w tu l int-as-uit ta w la'm?-s-uit/ or /...
tu'jntasuit .../ 'I think that they've already left their house'. With nominal forms of
quotational verbs alternatives with /k°i/-clauses were not recorded, and they probably
would sound as unelegant in Squamish as ""the one who was thought that he was
eating fire"" sounds in English.","[201, 202]"
"                                           Type V303. Type V differs from the preceding ones in having the element /q/ attached to
/hay/ rather than having it as a proclitic with what follows (as in III and IV). The
element /q/ has assumed the status of a suffix in /hau-q/ 'there is not' (negative counter-
part of /ci?/, see 257), cf. also /tx°-(h)au-q/ 'there is no longer' (I have no record of
a word t/x°u?alx°-q/ 'there is not yet'). That /q/ is a suffix rather than a clitic here
is proved by the fact that the clitic /?u/, which in interrogative sentences always is the
second word from the beginning, follows the combination /hau-q/, e.g. /ha'u-q w ?u
na^sni'Sim-s/ 'didn't he say anything?' (versus type Ilia /ha'u^Pu q w ?ax° w ?i'Xn/
'didn't you eat?'); cf. also the derivative /ha'u-q-i?/ 'be reduced to zero, give out*
(for /-i?/ see 186:34). Examples: /ha'u-q ji'PuX/ 'there is no firewood', /ha'y-q
n-sja'cm/ 'I have no news', /ha'u-q sc'ic'a'p'-s/ 'he has no work', /ci1? ti^nrmia'C
ua'X, ha'u-q n-sPna'm/ 'I have a spearpoint, but no shaft', /ha'u-q_^?u na^sni'Cim-s/
'didn't he say anything?', /ha'u-q na w sni'£im-s/ 'he didn't say anything', /ha'y-q
n-sq,0u'i.n3x7 'I've caught nothing', lit. 'there is not my catch' (cf. /qa'X
ta w n-sq >0 u'i.n9x7 'I've caught a lot').
   Notice the difference between t/ha'uq n-sk°ci'?c/ 'I have no relative' (not recorded
as such, but constructed on the basis of the above examples) and /ha 'u qwn-sk°ci'?c-as/
'he is no relative of mine' (see 290).
   In the two examples I have of interrogative sentences with a 2nd pers. possessive
affix in the subject, the clitic /q/ is repeated with the subject-word after /ha'y-q_?u/;
this is probably a contamination of type V with II and IV: /ha'u-q^Pu qa^Pa-
sja'cmI 'what's new?', lit. 'haven't you any news?', /ha'y-q^Pu qa^Pa-sq'Vi.nax""/
'have(n't) you caught anything?'.
                                            XXVII                                       ¡X/-C LAUSES
304. /ty-clauses correspond to English subordinate clauses introduced by a relative
adverb (why, where, when, how) or by a relative pronoun which is not the subject or
object of the clause ('about whom', 'with which', etc.; see 275). Such clauses are
preceded by articles where these are required (see 266ff.). They fall into two main
types. In type I the subject of the clause is referred to by a personal clitic following /X/;
in type II the subject is referred to by a possessive affix; these affixes may be added to
/X/ by itself or to a phrase consisting of /X/ plus a following clitic or verb or both:
                       I. /X w ?an .../, 3 sg. /X w ?as .../
                      II. /(?)nrX^.../, 3 sg. A - s o r        /X w ...-s/
The two alternatives with possessive suffixes in II are sometimes a matter of free
choice; for an example see 308.","[195, 196]"
"                         A. NOMINAL SECONDARY RELATA270. Nominal secondary relata correspond in the first place to English pre-
positional phrases, e.g. /nawX.i'fi>itas ta w smi'c t-ta^Xa'fc'tn/ 'he cut the meat with
the knife', /na w q >0 u l q°utcas t-k°aci w q >0 q°a l mn/ 'he hit me with an ax',
/na w ci'qin?tcas t-k'aci^p'a'c'tn/ 'he stabbed me with a needle', /na w ca'x°ntas
ta w sui'?qa t-ta^sma'nt/ 'he hit (threw at) the man with the stone', /5-n w p3 l X°n
ta^sui'Pqa t-ta^t'u'jPt/ lit. 'I spit at the man with the medicine (chewed medicinal
herbs)'; the latter two sentences are the normal translations of 'he threw the stone
at the man' and 'I spit medicine on the man'; in the same way /Xit'u'sn-ka
taN_s?i'x°aX. t-ta^sta'q 0 / 'sprinkle the water on the child's face!', lit. 'face-sprinkle
the child with the water!'.
   With intrans. verbs: /nawX.'3,iq> tawmi'XaX, t-ta w jta'sSn/ 'the bear got caught
(squeezed) in the trap', /na w q°u l i ^aci^n-sui'tn t-k°3ciwq°X.ali?/ 'my net got
hooked up on a log'.
   With act.-itr. verbs, nominal secondary relata allow English translations as direct
objects as well as prepositional phrases, e.g. / n a w u a w t a h i ' m ? t-k°9ciwk>°alx°a?/
'he is making a box', 'he is working on a box', /na^cx°i'm? t-ta w sma'nt/ 'he threw
(with) the stone'. In the following, more complex example with an itr. verb, the
English phrasing has to be quite different from Squamish: /nawlix°-a'i?X-m ta_Ta'm
t-PaXi^ma'nP-s tx°.nalm? Va^Pi'ta/ 'Tom gave his daughter (in marriage) to Peter'.
/lix°-a'i?X-m/ is a suffixed and intransivized verb of the type described in 180: action
performed by the subject on his own X (in this case X is not a body-part but one's
child /-ai?Xf). The root /lix0/ means 'fall down', trans. /lix°-t/ 'put down', so that
/lix0a'i?Xm/ may be translated 'put down one's child; itr.'. The noun 'his child'
appears separately as R2 /t-PaXi^ma'nP-s/ (feminine article; relative case), so that
the phrase means literally 'he-put-down-his-child with-regard-to-his-daughter' = 'he
                                       SECONDARY RELATA                                          181gave his daughter in marriage' (LM gave the translation 'he put down his daughter
to P.). For the phrase ^"".mi'm? Va^Pi'ta/ see 271 and 273.
   The verb /na-n/ 'call, name; tr.' takes an R2 specifying the name: /6-n w ua w na'-
n-t-m t-k°i, .Pi 'ta/ 'I am called (by the name of) Peter', /na w ua^na'-n-t-c-as-uit
(t-)k°i Pi'ta/ 'they call me Peter'. For an exceptional type of construction with
*/su3'?u-s/ see 267, end.
271. In the second place, nominal secondary relata correspond to English pre-
positional objects, namely in those cases where they are combined with relator-verbs,
e.g. /«S-n^ua^na 1 ? X'a^Pa'lqsn/ 'I am at Point Grey', /tina'? w 5-n A,>awSqX°u1?-
mi§/ 'I am from Squamish', /?3sq>9q>0u'?^5-n X'a^Ta'm/ 'I am with Tom'. In
these examples the relator-verb is the predicate of the sentence; it may also itself
occupy the position of (verbal) secondary relatum, see 273.","[180, 181]"
"
                                      Possessive /s-ua?/206. For the expression of the general relation of object to (grammatical) person
loosely labeled ""possessive"" Squamish employs possessive affixes (see 128). In-
dependent possessive reference ('mine', 'yours', etc.) is made by means of the stem
/s-ua?/ combined with the possessive affixes (a special form in the 1st pers. plur.,
see below). These forms refer to actual possessions in the narrow sense of the word.
The stem /s-ua?/ may therefore be interpreted as meaning 'possession'; it does not
occur independently, however, but is used only with possessive affixes. The forms
are /Pn-s-ua1?/ 'mine', /s-?u-ty 'ours' (with /-?u-/ < /-ua?-/ and an element /-X/
reminiscent of /ni'maX/ 'we', / - u m u ' 1 s t pers. plur. object'), /?a-s-ua'?(-iap)/ 'thine
(yours)', /s-ya'?-s(-uit)/ 'his (theirs)'.
   These forms are used in three different ways. In the first place they occur in-
dependently, e.g. /Pa(s)-s3lq> k°i w ?a-sua 1 ?/ 'it's half yours', 'half (of it) belongs to
you'. In the second place, the 3rd pers. forms can be combined with a noun or
proper name indicating the possessor, e.g. /sua'P-s k°a w nTina l n ta w la'ni?/ 'the
house is my father's'. In the third place, the forms can be combined with nouns
provided with possessive affixes (so that the latter appear twice in one phrase), e.g.
/ha'PA. ta^Pa-sua 1 ? P-la'm?/ 'your house is good', /Pn-sua1? n-sq°mali? ti'/ 'this is
my dog', 'this dog belongs to me' (cf. /ni'X. n-sq0ma'i? ti'ua/ 'this is my dog'). The
146                                       MORPHOLOGY2nd pers. plur. suffix /-¿ap/ may be added either to /sua?/ or to the noun:
/ta_?3-sua'?-iap Pa-si1 q£/ or /ta_?3-sua'P Ps-si'qC-iap/ 'your pi. shingles'.
   /Pas-/ derivatives (see 164) cannot be combined with possessive affixes, and here
the use of combinations with /sua?/ is obligatory: /ta w n-sua'P Pas-p'a'q0/ 'my slab',
/ta^Pa-sua'P Pos-p'o'q°/ 'your slab', /ta w sua'?-s Pas-p'a'q""/ 'his slab', etc.","[145, 146]"
"The Nominal Paradigm130. The nominal form of a noun and of an itr. verb consists of the stem without
subject- and object-suffixes; the only difference between the two consists of the use
of the clitic /na/, rare with nouns and common with verbs.
   The nominal forms of a trans, verb constitute two series, one subject-centered
('who helps me, you, him, etc.'), the other object-centered ('whom I, you, he, etc.,
help(s)').
   The subject-centered series consists of the verb-stem extended with object-suffixes
(NB 3rd pers. object zero).
   The object-centered series consists of the verb-stem extended with subject-suffixes.
   Examples: Noun: /s-ui'?qa/ 'man'. Itr. verb: /na w X, > i'q/ '(one) who arrives'.
Tr. verb:                                    Subject-Centered
       /na^C'a'u-at-c/             /na   C'a 'u-at-umi/         /na^C'a'u-at/
'(one) who helps        me                          thee                         him'
       /naw 5 ' a 'u-at-umuX/      /naw 5 ' a 'u-at-umi-ap/     /na w 5 > a'u-at(-uit)/
'(one) who helps         us                         you                          them'                                     Object-Centered
       /na w 5'a'u-at-an/          /na^CVu-at-ax 0 /            /na^C'a'u-at-as/
'(one) whom           I                         you                          he help(s)'
       /na^C'a'u-at-at/            /na^S'a'u-at-aiap/           /na^C'a'u-at-as-uit/
'(one) whom           we                        you                          they help'
                                       PERSONAL AFFIXATION                                            89
The Finite Paradigm131. The 1st and 2nd pers. forms of the finite paradigm of nouns and intransitive verbs
consist of the clitic /£-/ provided with a subject-suffix plus the noun- or verb-stem.
The 3rd pers. forms lack a personal affix; they consist of the bare stem, in the case
of verbs usually preceded by the clitic /na/.
         /5-n^sui'?qa/ 'I am a man'                        /£-n w X/i l q/     'I come'
         /5-t w sui'?qa/ 'we are men'                      /C-t^Vi'q/          'we come'
         /5-x°^_,sui'?qa/ 'thou art a man'                 / 5 - x ° _ W q / 'thou comest'
         /5-ap, ,sui'?qa/ 'you are men'                    / f i - a p ^ W q / 'you come'
         /sui'PqaI        'he (it) is a man',              /na. ,Vi'q/         'he comes'
                          'they are men'                   /na^X'i'q-uit/ 'they come'The clitic-combinations with /6-/ may also follow the stem: /sui '?qaw 5-n, X.'i 'q w 5-n/,
etc. The clitic /na/ always precedes.
   Other clitics may be inserted between /5-n/, etc., /na/ and the stem, e.g.
/£-n_ua^,c > ic > a l p > / 'I am (was) working', / n a ^ u a ^ c ' i c ' a ' p ' / 'he is (was) working'.
   The clitic /na/ may occur with 1st and 2nd pers. forms also, e.g. / n a w C - n ^ y a w
c'ic'a'p'/ 'I was working'; on the other hand, it may be absent in 3rd pers. forms,
e.g. /t'ix""^?/ 'it gets dry', /ck>0a'cut t a ^ k ' V t ' a n / 'the mouse runs'.
   In the noun-paradigm the stem may be provided with possessive affixes, e.g.
/5-x°. .n-sja'j?/ 'you are my friend'.
   In the verb-paradigm the stem may be an intransitivized transitive, i.e., a passive
verb, e.g. /5-n w 6'a l u-at-m/ 'I am helped', /£-x°^6 > a l u-at-m/ 'you are helped',
/na^C'a'u-at-m/ 'he is helped'. These forms are often found in contexts where
English would have an active verb with 3rd pers. actor ('he helps me, thee, him, etc.');
with a 2nd pers. object ('he helps thee, you') it is the only form used (see below).
   The 1st and 2nd pers. subject forms of the transitive finite paradigm consist of
/£-/ + subject-suffix and stem with object-suffix (3rd pers. zero).
   The 3rd pers. subject forms occur only with a 1st or 3rd pers. object (the former
referred to by a 1st pers. object suffix), and here the stem is provided with a 3rd pers.
subject suffix. For the expression of 'he, they help(s) thee, you' Squamish has
recourse to the passive forms /£-x°^5 ) a l u-at-m, S-ap^CVu-at-m/ 'thou, you are
helped'; these forms belong to the itr. paradigm /C-n^C'a'u-at-m/ 'I am helped',
see above.
   On p. 90 a complete transitive paradigm is quoted. Where only passive forms are
used, these are given in braces. Note that the finite form /na^Ca'u-at-as/ 'he helps
him' is identical with the nominal form meaning 'one whom he helps' (and not with
'one who helps him'; see also 255). Corresponding forms with a subject-suffix
other than 3rd person can be used predicatively but they are very rare: my material
contains only /nawnq>a'A,»n3x°-at/ 'we /-at/ ran into it'.

  The Hypothetical Paradigm  132. The forms of the hypothetical paradigm posit a state of affairs which is not
  actual, i.e. which is denied, suggested, anticipated, made a condition, or asked about.
  For the use of these forms see 285-290, 319-322.
     The forms of this paradigm are without exception characterized by subject-
  suffixes added to the noun- or verb-stem. The trans, verb-stem may, in addition, be
  provided with a 1st pers. object-suffix. A form '(if) I help you' was not recorded.
     Examples (forms marked with f were not recorded themselves but were made up
  on the basis of analogous examples with other stems): |/s-ui'Pqa'as/ '(if) he is a man',
  t/s-ui'?qa 2 an/ '(if) I am a man', /X'i'q-as/ '(if) he comes', /X.'i'q-an/ '(if) I come',
  /S'a'u-at-as/ '(if) he helps him', /£'a'u-at-c-as/ '(if) he helps me', /C'a'u-at-an/ '(if) I
  help him', /SVu-at-c-ax°/ '(if) you help me', etc.; example with a passive verb
  /ju l h w 6-a l x°, k^a'Srn-m-ax 0 / 'be careful, they might see you!', lit. 'you might be seen'.","[88, 89, 90]"
"140. The suffix /-uai/ is added to all types of trans, stems ending in /t/, i.e. with the
trans, suffixes /-(V)t-, -s-t-, -(V)n-t-/; its alternant /-ai?/ was recorded only with two
reduplicated stems with stressed /-a't/. Due to the intentional-transitive meaning of
the stems to which it is added, this suffix can always be translated 'each other', it
does not have the ""(disjoining"" sense of /-nauPas/. Where the latter has the meaning
'each other', it can be directly opposed to /t/-derivatives of the same stem with
/-uaj, -ai/, e.g. /C'a'urnauPas/ 'be of assistance to each other' vi. /5'a-C'auP-a't-ai/
'help each other'; /Vi'P-nauPas/ 'have a liking to each other' vs. /X'i'P-s-t-uai/ 'love
each other', lit. 'cause each other to be dear'.

141. The Squamish language makes a wide use of various types of reduplication.
From a formal point of view the reduplicative formations can be subdivided into
total reduplications QVCVQfV^Ca... (in the case of longer stems, only the first two
consonants are involved) and partial reduplications, the latter subdivided into initial
reduplications CxV-QCV)^... and final reduplications C1(V)C2-yC2.                  Further
differentiations of these types result from different vocalisations, from the presence
or absence of /?/ and from the position of the stress. There are cases of doubly
reduplicated forms.
   In total reduplications the first syllable CVC- is called reduplication-syllable.
   In general, reduplication concerns root-elements rather than affixes, cf. /s-taq-taqi'u/
'horses', reduplicated plural of /s-taqi'u/ 'horse' (both simplex and reduplicated form
preceded by the nominalizer /s-/). There are two prefixes, however, which are them-
selves reduplicative formations (see /XsX-/ 179:9 and /?a?-/ 179:12, cf. also 161).
   As a living grammatical procedure, total reduplication serves to express plurality
or collectiveness in nouns, iteration, intensity or distributiveness in verbs, and
reference to persons in numerals. Partial (initial) reduplication expresses continuous-
ness in verbs, reference to animals in numerals, and — with /i/ in the reduplication-
syllable — diminutiveness in nouns and verbs. The ""participial"" /?as-/ derivatives
of verbal roots (see 164-167) often contain the latter in totally or initially reduplicated
form. Besides these productive cases, reduplicative forms are found in most color-
designations and in some other quality-words, in many animal-names (total and
partial), and in a large number of individual stems; it is within the latter category
that the widest variety of types is found (and almost all instances of final and double
reduplication belong here).","[96, 97, 98]"

Sapir's suggestions concerning a relationship of Salish with Chemakuan and Wakashan, and of this
""Mosan"" group with Kutenai and Algonquian are based on intuition, and Sapir's intuitions are worth
being followed up. However, so far no adequate testing is possible because of lack of data. Swadesh's
discussion of the Mosan theory (1953) leaves one with a sense of intellectual discomfort. His list of 16
""common features of the three stocks"" (p. 28 if.) on the one hand contains several items which are
quite common outside the limits of Mosan; on the other hand, particularly in the case of Salish
features are listed as common which occur in part of the languages only. Swadesh's statement that
these ""must go back at least to the proto-languages"" is unsubstantiated and gives cause for doubt in
several instances (e.g. the gender-distinction in demonstratives and articles may well be an innovation
of Coast Salish; moreover, this distinction is not made in Wakashan). Again, a list of 10 ""common
structural features"" (i.e. grammatical elements), 8 of which involve demonstratives and other sub-
stitutes (p. 31) can be given for many pairs of languages. In fact, about as convincing a case can
be made for a relationship of Squamish and Indo-European, cf. the following resemblances (NB
Sq. /ah, ih, uh/ = [a, e, o], /ah?/ = [a?""]):
    Phonology: a. Rich cons, and poor vowel-system, b. Opposition of plain and labialized conss.
 in the velar (Sq. also uvular) series, c. Category of sonants occurring in consonantal and vocalic
 positions, d. Phonemic expiratory stress. — Morphophonology: e. Favorite root-shape CVC.
/ . Occasional interchange of root-conss., one of them a velar (Sq. /mak°, k°sm/ 'lump', /cak'° (cak°),
 k'°3c/ 'pull', /nak"", k°sn/ 'start, stir', /q°pi'cn/, Cw. pqVcan 'sand' ~ IE. *pek°-, *k°ep- (Lit. kepii)
 'cook', *spek'-, sk'ep- (Gr. ffK&rronai) 'scrutinize', *dheig'h-, *g'heidh- (Lit. iiediiu, OCS. zbdati)
 'mould, build', g. Roots occur in full and weak (a- or zero-) grade: Sq. CaC ~ C(a)C, etc. h. Vocal-
 ization in combinations of CVC- with -(V)C dependent on stress (Sq. Ca'C-C or CC-s'C). — Mor-
phology. i. Limited (and clearly recent) prefixation. j. Extensive suffixation. k. Occurrence of
 total and partial reduplications of various types defined by grade of root, vowel of reduplication-
 syllable, etc. (cf. the Gr. types (1) n6p-jaopog, (2) JIE-JIXO?, (3) TI-8f)vri, (4) Tti-jixco and the Sq. types
 (1) /s-qa'x°-qax7. (2) /s-qa'-qx% (3) /ci'-cayPin/, (4) /qi'-qpu'sm/). /. Alternate expressions for

 in both languages are to a large extent built on phonetically identical elements; moreover, these
phonetic (and at least in some cases, morphological) elements recur in substitutes, in numerals 'one',
in terms for blood- and age-relations and in words for 'name, naming'. Point q. will now be set
forth in some detail.
   (1) Sq. /t-/ in the articles-demonstratives /ta, ti, taj?/ 'definite-present'; in relationship-terms:
/tah?/ 'mother' (address), /hata'h?/ 'aunt' (address), /s-(h)a'ta?/ 'aunt' (/s-/ nominalizer) ~ IE.

   (2) Sq. /k°-/ in the articles-demonstratives /k°a, k°aci/, etc. 'definite-absent', /k°i/ 'indefinite'
(frequent in interrog. sentences, and introducing a common type of subord. clause) ~ IE. *k°-
'indef.-interrog.-relat.'.
   (3) Sq. /nah, na(?), na-, n-/ demonstr. 'there, at, on': /na/ interj. 'there you are!', /na?/ 'be on,
be at', /na(?)/ predicative clitic 'at (place, time)'; (3a) in pers. pronouns /nay/ 'thou', /na'y-jap/
'you pi.' (for /-y/ see 4a), /ni'maX/ 'we' (cf. /maX/ emphatic clitic); (3b) in other substitutes and in

(3c) in relationship-terms: /na'ya/ 'spouse' (address; cf. /nay/ under 3a); in words of naming: trans-
itivized in /na-n/ 'call', nominalized in /s-nah, s-na?/ 'name' ~ IE. *(e-)n'/o-, *na, *no, etc. 'that,
such, there, on, at, etc.'; (3A) in pers. pron. *nó(s)-, p*(s)- 'lpl. oblique'; in other substitutes and
num. 'one' : *ono- OCS. onb 'that, he' Av. ana- 'this' (cf. also Skt. e-na 'this'), *on-tero- 'other' Skt.
antara-, *oinos 'one' Lat. unus (cf. 4B); (3C) in relationship-terms *an(riy 'ancestor, gr. mother,
old woman, etc.' Hitt. hannas Arm. han 'gr. mother', Lat. anus 'old woman', cf. also Hitt. annas
'mother'; (3D) in words of naming: suffixed in *(e)n(S)-mff 'name' Lat. nómen OPruss. emmens
(cf. the bare reduplicated root in Chukchee-Koryak nsnna 'name').
   (4) Sq. /ya?, ya, va-, -u/ in /-ya/ emphatic particle used with demonstratives (/ti'-ya/ 'this one',
etc.), /ya/ predicative clitic 'continuous', /ya' 2 u/ (reduplication) 'to continue'; (4a) in pers. pron.
see /nay/ 3a; (4b) in other substitutes: /s-ya?/ indep. poss. stem (/s-/ nominalizer; /?n-sya?/ 'mine',
/?a-sya?/ 'thine', etc.); (4c) in relationship-terms: /s-ya?-a'm/ 'close relative'; (4d) in words of naming:

   (5) Sq. /man, mn/ determinative-limitative element: /mani'ty 'he himself', /mn/ predicative
clitic 'just', and /man/ 'father', /man?/ 'offspring', /s-manP-a'X,/ 'person of upper class' ~ IE. *ma(n),

(cf. V. V. Ivanov, ObSéeindoevropejskaja, praslavjanskaja i anatolijskaja jazykovye sistemy, Mos-
cow 1965, p. 193), to which could be added Lat. mànés 'ancestors' spirits' (whose connection with
mams 'good' can be plausibly ascribed to folk-etymology), cf. also Mannus 'ancestor of the Germani'
(Tacitus). Notice also the identical cultural feature of regarding the younger generations as a mirror-
image of the older ones: OHG. ano 'ancestor', Germ. Ahn (see 3C) vs. OHG. enencheli 'grandchild',
Germ. Enkel SI. vbnQkb ~ Sq. /man/ 'father', /man?/ 'offspring', /sòa'mPaq0/ 'gr. gr. parent', 'gr.
gr. child' (and so on for two more generations).
   Other similar grammatical elements include:
   (6) A (sometimes facultative) prefix s-, cf. IE. mobile *s- ~ Sq. /s-/ nominalizer < /Pas-/ 'parti-
cipial' < /?as/ '3rd person' ; facultative use orig. along the lines of Engl, ""a housing"", ""a house"".
   (7) Suffixes -n, -t, -nt, in Sq. transitivizing, in IE. participial (the first two passive, implying a
trans, verb, the third active in IE. other than Hitt. where it serves as both act. and pass.).
   (8) An emphatic element kV which in IE. hàs leanings towards use in imperatives, cf. SI. ko, ka
'adhortative', Lit. -k(i) 'imperative' (-/ on the analogy of other imperatives) ~ Sq. /-ka/ 'imperative
suffix' (facultative, replaceable by a 2nd. pers. element).
   (9) A diminutive-hypocoristic suffix -(V)l.
   (10) Suffixed elements found in both nouns and verbs and characterized by a, i, and u timbres,
the cases with /' and u in two main varieties depending on whether they are peak or satellite (sche-
matically -ih, -uh or - Vi, -Vy, besides which there is only -Vft), cf. the IE. noun-stems in *-a, *-(e)f,
*-i, *-(e)y, *-u and the verb-stems in *-a, *-jejo, *-[, *-éjo, i, etc. ~ Sq. formatives /-a(?), -aj(?), -i(?),
-u(?)/, connectives /-ai-, -ay-/ and the suffixes /-ai(?), -i(?)/ 'inchoative-static', /-ai?/ orig. 'having
a relation to (object or action denoted by root)'. Both languages have in common that in many
cases no meaning can be ascribed to these elements, but cf. Sq. /-ai?/ just mentioned and IE *-jejo
(type OCS. Ibib < *lugh-jo- 'mendacious, liar').
   In conclusion, here follow some lexical comparisons which could serve to support the phonetic
                                               APPENDIX                                              403
equations implied by the above. Since these comparisons involve new equations which in turn
must be supported, the field shall be limited in the following way (see table of Sq. phonemes on
p. 22): let the IE. labial, dental, plain velar and labiovelar series correspond to the Sq. ones (the
Sq. velar and uvular series being considered to have merged in IE. — there is considerable over-
lapping within Salish itself); let the IE. voiceless and voiced-aspirated series correspond to the
Sq. plain and glottalic ones respectively, with the proviso that a Sq. plain cons, can correspond
to an IE. voiced-aspirated one when there is evidence for (actual or likely) secondary glottalization
in Sq. (which is often the case with roots CV?, CVh(?)), with the added check that there should at
least in some cases also be doublets in IE. Let Sq. /I/ correspond to IE. *r, */. Excluded from the
experiment are for IE. the palatovelar and the plain voiced series, for Sq. the palatal and lateral
series and the velar and uvular fricatives. For the sake of convenience IE. roots are quoted in an
— in some cases undoubtedly illusory — e-phase.
   (11) For the equation Sq. /t/ ~ IE. *t (1 above): Sq. /tah-m/ 'leak; itr.' (Kal. tiPi'm 'melt, get
wet') ~ IE. *ta- 'melt, thaw, flow, wet, etc.'.
   (12) Sq. /t/ ~ IE. *dh < *t?: Sq./tah?, ta?/(a) 'undergo, be made', (b) 'be located', cf. also the
prefix /ti-/ 'make' ~ IE. *dhe- (a) 'make, do' Lat. feci OCS. dih, (b) 'put, place' Gr. tOtim; a Sq.
form with /t'/ in /t'a?-t/ 'try, taste, sample; tr.\
   (13) In the same way Sq. /puh-, pah-/ 'blow, swell' corresponds both to IE. *petf-, *pu- 'blow,
swell' and to *bhey,-, *bhii- 'blow, swell, grow, etc.', cf. the s-derivatives Sq. /pi'?s-m/ 'bubble, itr.'
(with diminutive /i/) ~ Lit. pusti 'blow' (ab. wind), piisti 'swell', Russ. puxnut' 'id.', Lat. pustula,
and on the other hand Russ. buxnut' 'swell' Ags. bosom, etc.; via the notion 'grow' (not attested
in Sq.) derivatives meaning 'vegetation, flower' have developed (in IE. in part secondarily connected
with *bhel- 'shine'): Sq. /s-pa'q'am/ 'flower' ~ Gr. (putov 'vegetation' SI. bylhje 'herb', Gr. (puXXov
Lat. folium 'leaf', Germ. bld(-m, -s, -/) Lat. fids 'flower'. Medial glottalization (as in CdA. pu?us
'swell, bubble, ferment', Kal. pe?ex° 'swell') has given rise to forms with p': Cw. p'a'm 'swell', Sq.
/s-p'u'q^am/ 'foam' (an IE. form with u in Lat. spuma; a deviating initial in Skt. phena- 'foam').
   (14) For the equation Sq. /k°, q°/ ~ IE. *k° (2 above): Sq. /taq 0 / 'drink', /s-taq°/ 'water, river',
where /t-/ is a petrified prefix as appears from Sq. /n-q°u' 2 us/ 'tear' (/-us/ 'face') and CdA. aq°-s
'drink' ~ IE. *ak°a, *ek°- 'water, river', Lat. aqua, Russ. Oka, ON. AZgir 'God of the sea', Hitt.
eku-, aku- 'drink'. See also (22).
   (15) For Sq. /n/ ~ IE. *n (3): Sq. /ni'q ,0 am/ 'soft' (/-am/ itr. suffix) ~ IE. *(s-)neig°h- 'snow,
soft, wet, sticky' (-> 'languor, inclination', etc.) BS1. *snaiga- Lat. nix, nivis 'snow', ORuss. niga
'eixppoativri', Russ. nega 'languor', neznyj 'tender', Prakrit sirieha < *sneha- 'snow', Av. snaeiaiti
'it snows' Skt. sneha- 'stickiness, grease', snihyati 'becomes wet, sticky; is favorably disposed'. Cf.
next item.
   (16) Same semantic range as in (15) in Sq. /ma'qa?/ 'snow' (/-a?/ formative) ~ IE. *mek- 'wet,
soft' BS1. m&k- 'wet' Lit. makuonis 'cloud' OCS. mokrb 'wet' and with secondary nasal infix (as in
BS1. *se(n)k- 'dry up') OCS. m$kbkb 'soft' untfkngti 'AjtaXuveaSai' um^iiti 'M>eiv, solvere', Russ.
pro-, na-mjakat' 'get soft by soaking' OCS. mgka 'flour' (BS1. *menk- 'soft' secondarily connected
with IE. *men{a)k- 'knead, crush, soften', cf. SCr. mek, meka, meknuti agreeing with muka 'tor-
ment' and not with muka 'flour'), cf. further OIc. mgkkr 'cloud'. For Sq. 'wet' see next item.
   (17) For Sq. / q ~ IE. *g°h (15): Sq. /q >0 ac'/ 'tide coming in', weak grade in /q>03C>/ 'wet',
/q'V-i 1 ?/ 'become wet' (see 10) ~ IE. *g°hd-er- Skt. ksarati 'flows' kfaram 'water' Av. yiaraiti 'flows'.
   (18) In the same way Sq. /q'°al/ 'cooked, done', /q'°al-t/ 'cook; tr.', CdA. q'°al 'cook, burn' ~
IE. *g°her- 'warm', cf. especially SI. gnm 'cauldron' hat. fortius 'oven', OCS. goriti Lit. gareti 'burn'.
   (19) For Sq. /q/ ~ IE. *k (16): Sq. /maq-a'lx°ca>./ 'tongue' (/-alx°caX/ suff. 'tongue') ~ IE.
*(s-)mek- 'jaws, mouth' Lit. smSkras 'chin' Let. smakrs 'chin, palate' Lat. maxilla 'upper jaw'.
   (20) Cf. with (19) Sq. /maq'/ 'be full (fr. eating)', /ti-s-maq'-ma'q'-m/ 'overeat' ~ IE. *smegh-
Lit. smaguriduti 'eat sweets' OHG. gismagmo 'taste' (besides which *smeg- in OFris. smakia MEngl.
smakin).
   (21) For Sq. /u, y/ ~ IE. *u, y. (4): Sq. /\ji-/ in /s-\ji'?qa/ 'man', reduplicated and with an 1-suffix
in /s-yi'u?lus/ 'young man' ~ IE. *yei-,           'force' Lat. vis Gr. (F)ig, with an r-suffix in Lat. vir
Lit. vyras 'man', ORuss. vira 'wergild'.
   (22) For the same equation and for Sq. /i, H ~ IE. */, j (21): Sq. /ju'jaPk 0 / 'wave, current, rapids',
/iu'ia?k°m/ 'undulate', /iu'ia?-k°ms/ 'make waves (ab. a ship)'; the word goes back to */iuh-iah-k%
a reduplication of a Viuh with weak grade in the 2nd element (/-k°/ is a formative in words with

 'fiery' (ab. unmixed wine) SI. jan 'ardor, fury' Slov. jar, jarina 'place where the water foams' Gr.
 CfjX,oi; 'ardor', cf. also       'stir' Skt. pra-yduti 'stirs (food)' Russ. jur reki 'rushing current, whirl-
 pool', *jeu-s, *ju-s 'brew' Gr. CuW 'leaven' SI. juxa 'soup', *jes- 'seethe' Gr. Ceq>, etc. Notice that
 on the basis of the Sq. type of ablaut all these forms (particularly *ies-) can be connected: Sq. /Cah/
 [Ca] (where C = any cons.) is in medial position reduced to /Ca, Ca/. See also (30).
    (23) Sq. /Pi/ '(be) here', as a predicative clitic 'proximal' ~ IE. *i- demonstr. Lat. Got. is Lit.
j'ts SI. jb, cf. also Sq. /Pi'na/ 'the one, the other' ~ IE. *oi-(n-) 'one' (3).
    (24) Sq. /k°ui-/ 'joke, be funny' in /?as-k°u'i*c/ 'joke, talk funny' (/Pas-/ 'participial', /-c/ 'mouth'),
 /k°ui-k 0 ui-c-a'm/ 'to joke; itr.' may be a result of inversion (see Morphophonemics / . above, partic-
 ularly the examples with /k 0 / and sonant) e.g. to avoid homonymy with a simplex */iu-k°/ implied
 by /ju'iaPk 0 / in 22; hence the word can be connected with Lat. jocus Lit. judkas 'joke' < *jek°-.
 The Sq. form is common-Salish, cf. CdA. q°ay 'joke, talk backwards' (whose very meaning suggests
 inversion).
    (25) For Sq. /m/ ~ IE *m (5, 16): Sq. Viam? 'gird, girth' in /nax°-ia'm?-tn/ 'belt' (/nax°-/ 'on',
 /-tn/ 'implement') ~ IE. *iem- 'tie together' Skt. ydmati 'bridles', ydma- 'bridle', ydntra 'strand,
 strap'. IE. *}em- is to *ie'connect'        (Skt. yduti, yuvati) what *jes- is to *iey- 'stir' (22); here a link
 is provided by Sq. /¡a?/ < */iah?/ 'tight' (no full-grade form recorded).
    (26) For Sq. /s/ ~ IE. *s (6, 13): Sq. /sinV/ 'senior-line children, elder siblings', pi. /sn-si'nA.'/,
 cf. also /si?-sinV/ taboo-name for /sVaka'lm/ 'grizzly bear', lit. 'the old one' ~ IE. *sen- 'aged'
 Lat. senex Lit. senas 'old' (the comparison would imply that Sq. /i/ is symbolic here).
    (27) Sq. /saq'-, saq'/ 'split', /sq'-im?/ 'id.; act.-itr.' ~ IE. *sek- Lat. seed OCS ¡¿kg 'cut'. As
 final /q'/ is all-Salish, IE. *k would have to be secondary < *gh; in view of the numerous derivatives
 from the zero-form *sk- (*ske(n)d-, *skei(-d, -t, -p), etc.), and of the non-occurrence of initial *sgh-
 in IE., *sek- can be analogical to *sk- < *sgh- (cf. the alternative form with *skh- in Gr. oxiCto
 'split').
    (28) For Sq. /I/ ~ IE. */ (9): Sq. /n-talq-t/ 'answer someone; tr.\ possibly an extension of Vtal?
 'acquire knowledge' in /tal?-t/ 'learn, study; tr.', /ta'IP-nax0/ 'have found out, know' :: IE. *telk-
 Skt. tarkayati 'conjectures, reflects', tarka- 'conjecture' (whose connection with Lat. torqued is
 semantically unconvincing), OCS. tlbkb 'interpreter', Russ. tolk 'explanation, sense', Hitt. tarkum-
 maye- 'explain, translate', Luv. tarkummiya- 'announce' (cf. Akkadian targumanu 'interpreter',
 Georgian targmna 'translate'; a velar is lacking in the Turkic words for 'interpreter': Rumanian
 tylmac, Kirghiz tilmeS, etc., and also in Mitanni talarm). An unextended root possibly in ONo.
pulr 'orator, poet, wise man'.
    (29) Sq. Vq°al, q°al 'think, mind, speak', /q°a'l-q°l/ 'talk excessively', /n-q'Vl-tn/ 'voice' (/-tn/
 'implement'), possibly a composite root, as is suggested by the curious Ms. form q°ayl 'say, speak',
 and occurring with glottalization in Sh. q°E?el 'talk together' (besides q°uq°lut 'talk') could be con-
 nected with OCS. glagolati 'speak', glasb 'voice' (Common SI. *gol-gol-, *gol-s-) via IE. *g°h- <
 *k°P, while the plain form *k° is found in Lat. loquor 'speak' and quaero 'ask', the former as an
 inversion of *k°el- to avoid homonymy with cold, color (and possibly on the analogy of other words
 of 'speaking', cf. *sek°-, *uek°-, iek°-, Lat. inseque, vox, jocus and derivatives), the latter as a curious
 analogon to Ms. q°ayl.
     (30) The Gr. words quoted under (22) all have               < *}- possibly to be explained by an initial
 laryngeal. In Sq. an initial /j-/ sometimes alternates with /hi-/ < *haj-/, e.g. /j3'q0-lcp/ 'put wood
 on fire' and /hi?q°-i'n?/ 'torch'. This alternation, a relict in Sq., is more widespread in other Salish
 languages. It is therefore possible to compare Sq. ViavK?) 'spiritual power', /Pas-ja'u?/ 'seer, fortune-
 teller', /s-iu?-i'n?/ 'witchcraft', /iau?-i'n2c/ 'understand (speech)', cf. also /s-ja'u-an/ 'song', /iau?i'n 2 m/
 'sing' ~ IE. *H2eiff-, *ff2ieu- in Skt. dyu- 'life force', Av. yaoi-daSaiti 'purifies ritually', Gr. al(F)ri>v
 'life, (lifetime', Lat. aevus, -m (and possibly iiis OLat. ious orig. 'religious formula which has force
 of law'), Got. aiws. In view of the Germanic proneness to mobile s one might even be tempted to
 connect Got. saiwala 'soul' and saiws 'sea' with *Hieiti- 'life force' and with *Heiy- 'be turbulent'
 (22) respectively. Also, Bait. *jur- 'sea' need not have its j- from jdura{s) 'marsh' (cf. OPruss. iurin
 'sea, acc. sg.' vs. wurs 'pond') but can continue an IE. *Hfii-r-.
     (31) For the inversions posited in 24, 29: Sq. Vk°um?, k°am(?) 'to rise; protuberance, lump;
 thump' (for the semantics cf. Lat. verruca 'wart' and OCS. vrtxt 'top') in /k°um?/ 'ascend, go ashore',
 /?as-k°u1 m?-k°um?-c7 'skinny', lit. 'with protruding bones /-c'/', /(s-)kVmik°m-c7 'lump', /k°a'm-
                                            APPENDIX                                           405
i?n/ 'to thump', etc., inverted in \/m3k° 'be lump-shaped; be wrapped up' in /s-mak°/ 'lump (on
tree)', /n»'k°-u?/ 'be wrapped', etc. ~ IE. *k°om-, *k'um- in BS1. *kama- 'lump' Lit. kamuolys
Russ. kom Czech kmen, Lat. cumulus 'heap', Gr. kOuti 'wave' (secondary connection with kusco
'get pregnant', hence orig. 'swelling'), inverted in *m3k°-, *mik- Gr. hukt)i; 'mushroom; mushroom-
like protuberance', MHG. Mocke 'lump', Germ. Mauch(e) 'id.', Lat. macula 'blemish on skin' (sim-
ilar inversions in Gr. liUKctpi?' vwcrepi; 'bat', Lit. kumste 'flstblow' < *punkste 'fist').
   If the IE. languages of ca. 1000 BC were spoken anywhere near Salish at present, and if they were
as imperfectly known, then the above parallels and comparisons could be used to suggest a remote
common origin. However, as long as the descriptive spade-work largely remains to be done and
intra-Salish comparison has not been worked out, genetic-comparative work must remain speculative
where distant, and inexact where closer connections are concerned.

  The Factual Paradigm  133. The forms of the factual paradigm express a state of affairs which may or may
  not actually exist, but which is simply referred to as such. If the forms of the
  hypothetical paradigm are rendered '(if) he is a man', '(if) he sees me', etc., those
  of the factual paradigm may be translated '(that) he is a man' or 'his being a man',
  '(that) he comes' or 'his coming', etc. For the use of these forms see 275-283,317-318.
     The factual forms have in common that they are based on nominal stems, verb-
                                      PERSONAL AFFIXATION                                    91
  forms being nominalized by the prefix /s-/; the subject is referred to by a possessive
  affix or — in trans, forms — by a subject-suffix (some forms combine both types of
  affixes, so that the subject is referred to twice).
     My material contains only one example involving a noun: /k°i w (s-)sn3'sqn-s/
  '(they thought) that it was hair-oil /sna 'sqn/' (IV: 26). The morphophonemic presence
  of an additional nominalizer /s-/ before the noun /sna'sqn/, which itself contains the
  nominalizer, is probable because all other forms of the factual paradigm have it, this
  additional /s-/ conveying the meaning 'the fact of its being ...'. Its presence could be
  checked by eliciting factual forms involving unmarked nouns (e.g. /mla'sis/ 'molasses',
  t/k°i w s-mla'§is(-s)/ 'that it was molasses'). I also cannot quote forms with other
  persons as subject ('that I am a man', etc.) or with possessive complexes ('that he
  is my brother', etc.).
     The factual forms of itr. verbs consist of the nominalized verb-stem provided with
  possessive affixes, e.g. /k°i w s-Wq-s/ 'that he arrives', /k°iw.n-s-A,>i'q/ 'that I
  arrive', etc.
     The factual forms of transitive verbs offer a more complex picture: they employ
  both possessive and subject-affixes to refer to the actor. Below a complete paradigm
  is given. Five forms are not represented in my material; they were conjectured on
  the analogy of the others and marked by the symbol t- This paradigm requires
  several comments.                   me                              thee                           him

  certain. The form 'they ... thee' is given on the analogy of /na w 5 > a'u-at-m(-uit)/ 'he
  is helped by them'. The forms 'thou/you ... them' and 'they ... you' are more doubt-
  ful, as there are no other examples of the combinations */-jap-uit/ and */-a(ja)p-uit/.
92                                         MORPHOLOGY   A striking peculiarity of several forms of the paradigm is the combination of
parallel possessive and subject-affixes. This is the case in the forms /?n-...-an/ 'I ...
him, them' and /?3-...-ax°/ 'thou ... me, him'. In the forms with 1 plur. subject only
the possessive suffix /-Cat/ appears. In the forms with 2 plur. subject, the 2nd pers
possessive prefix /?a-/ is combined with the subject-suffix /-a(ja)p/; but the prefix
/?o-/ is usually dropped in medial position (e.g. after the article /k°i/) both in sing,
and plur. The forms with 3rd pers. subject are identical with those of the finite
paradigm except for the nominalizer /s-/. They could be interpreted morpho-
phonemically as containing the possessive suffix /-s/ after the subject-suffix /-as/,
since /-as-s/ would not be distinct from /-as/ (see 41).
   Another striking feature of the paradigm is the fact that the plural of the 2nd pers.
object is expressed by /-uit/; thus, while one says /5-n w 6 > a l u-at-umi-ap/ 'I help you',
the nominalized form is /Pn-s-C'a 'u-at-umi-uit/ 'my helping you', and in the same
way /C-t^d'a'u-at-umi-ap/ 'we help you' versus /s-S'a'u-at-umi-Sa't-uit/.","[90, 91, 92]"
"55. The clitic /s-s/ (nominalizer /s-/ combined with 3rd pers. possessive sufF. /-s/)
when preceded by the article /k°i/ [k°e] is pronounced /sis/ [ses], an instance of
progressive vowel assimilation. Where morphemes are separated I write /k°i w s-i-s/
in order to avoid introducing an allomorph and having to assign /i/ arbitrarily to
either affix. A similar assimilation occurs in the combination /k°i w s-ua-s w /
[k°esyaes], also /k°i w s-yi-s w / [k°esues], and in /k°i w s-ni-s w / [k°esnes] (see 135);
these combinations contain the same morphological elements as /k°i w s-i-s_/ except
that the zero-element between /s-/ and /-s/ is replaced by the clitics /ua/ 'continuously',
resp. /na/ 'there'. Besides progressive vowel-assimilation, analogy to /k°i w s-i-s w /
may therefore play a role here.
44                                         PHONOLOGY56. Here follows an account of the reductions and mergers which occur in strings
of clitics. A few morphophonemic rules to which clitics are subject are given first.
    (1) The clitics /ua/ 'continuous' and /na/ 'there' have the forms /u, n/ when
immediately followed by one of the personal clitics (summed up in 54): / u _ ? a n ,
n w ? a t / , etc. See also (6) below. For the alternations /ua, -ui-/ and /na, -ni-/ see 55.
    (2) The clitic /q/ 'if' has the form /qa/ when immediately followed by the relative
clitic /X/ or by the 2nd pers. possessive prefix /?a-/: / q a w A , w / , /qa^,?3-.../.
    (3) The clitic /?u/ [?o] 'if, whether' in combination with a preceding clitic /na/ or
/ua/ results in a unique vowel [0-], the combinations being pronounced [n0-, U0-], the
former sometimes faintly sounding like [naua]. I write these combinations / n _ 3 u ,
u w 9 u / . The combination / n _ a u / can be used in isolation with an emphatic stress
(meaning approximately 'did he really?') and is then pronounced [ n 0 - 1 ] .
    (4) The complex clitic /£-x°/, consisting of the clitic /5-/ 'be, do' and the 2nd pers.
subject-suffix /-x°/ usually changes to [5ae] when immediately followed by the clitic
/q/ 'if': /2(-x°)^_,q/ [Caeq] (perhaps only artificially [53x°q]). This reduction is
reminiscent of that of the prefix /nax°-/ to /n-/ in certain complexes, see 48 and 169ff.
    (5) The clitic-combination / m n w u a w / tends to merge into [mae], e.g.
/ n w 3 u ^ 5 - x ° w m n w u a ^ _ h a l ? X / 'do you feel good?', in distinct pronunciation
[n0'C3x°mijU£eha              tends to be pronounced [n0£x°maeha'?A,] in more careless speech.
    (6) The clitic-combinations / q w u ^ , ? a n w , q w u ^ , ? a x ° w / , etc. (the third clitic
one of the personal elements, before which /ua/ has the alternant /u/ acc. to (1) above)
tend to merge into either [q>0£en, q>0ox°] or [q°aen, q°ox°] (glottalization facultative,
see 54). This combination is common in negative sentences, where it is preceded by
the predicate-word /ha'u/ 'it is not the case'. In these sentences the final /u/ of /hau/
tends to be lost, or rather, it merges with the labialization in [q'°, q°], e.g. /ha'u
q ^ u ^ P a n ^ P i ' X n / [ha -l u qu(?)aen?e-'X,ij, haqC)°aen?e-'X,n] 'I am not going to eat'.
    (7) The clitic-combinations /q^_,?an^, q w ? a x ° w / , etc., tend to merge into [q'aen,
q'ox 0 ], etc. when the glottalization is preserved (otherwise [qaen, qox°], etc.). Before
these combinations, too, /hau/ tends to lose its final /u/, possibly on the analogy of
the cases mentioned under (6), e.g. /ha'u q ^ P a n ^ P a ' n u X / [ha - '(u) qC)®n?a-'noX]
 'I don't agree'.
    The reductions (5-7), being facultative, are not reflected in phonemic notation,
whereas the alternations (1-3) are. In case (4) I write /S(-x°) w q/.
                                             IV                          STRUCTURE O F MORPHEMES
                                  A. MORPHEMES CVC57. The favorite type of root-morpheme (i.e. morpheme other than clitic, affix or
reduplication-syllable) has the form Q V Q , where either C x or C 2 may also be
represented by /?/, and C 2 also by /R?/. Henceforth, when ""morphemes CVC"" are
discussed, the types /?VC, CV?, CVR?, ?VR?/ will be understood to be included.
   When V in CVC is represented by A ( = full vowel), there is often a corresponding
form with /a/, e.g. /sa'q'-an/ 'split; tr.' (transitive suff. /-an/) and /saq'/ 'split; itr.';
/mui/ 'submerge' and /maj/ 'sink'. Under certain phonological conditions a morpheme
/CaC/ alternates with /CC/, cf. /saq'/ just quoted and /sq'-i'm?/ 'split; act.-itr.'.
Where forms /CAC/ and /C(a)C/ occur side by side, we speak of full and /a/- or
zero-grade.
   From the morpheme-type CVC are excluded:
   (a) Cases with identical C x and C 2 . In view of the very extensive use of reduplication
in Squamish, such formations are considered reduplicative. They are summed up in
section 161.
   (b) The types */Cah(?), Cuu(?), Cij(?)/; in other words, no morpheme has a full
vowel followed by the corresponding sonant.
   (c) The type */Ca?/.
   (d) The type */?3R?/.
   Subdividing the type C a VC 2 into classes according to the nature of C x and C 2 in
terms o f / K , ?, R, R?/ (the latter for C 2 only) and of V in terms of/A, a/, 3 X 2 X 4 = 24
possible sub-types are obtained, of which 5 are excluded (to wit */?A.?, ?a?, Ka?,
Ra?, ?aR?/).
   The occurrence of /?/ after a sonant is often due to morphological factors (see 69-72);
furthermore, the types /CVR/ and /CVR?/ are sometimes in free variation even in the
most careful pronunciation. In giving examples, I quote only such cases as are
regularly pronounced without, resp. with /?/ when used in isolation or in formations
where /?/ is minimally suspect of being due to morphology. The types /Ca?, Cu?, Ci?/
are etymologically equivalent to /Cah?, Cay?, Cai?/, and these six are treated
46                                      PHONOLOGYseparately in 61-64, so that from the examples given below the types /KA?, RA?/ are
excluded as a whole, while of /KaR?, RaR?/ only examples with /m?, n?, 1?/ are quoted.
   Of the very numerous types /KAK, KaK/ three examples each are quoted; of the
types ending in /R(?)/ examples with each of the sonants /m, n, 1, h, u, jj (in this
order) are given (in so far as they are available). When possible, free forms CVC are
quoted; next in line are forms with the nominalizing prefix /s-/ or with trans, and
intrans. suffixes. Where no such cases are available, the root is quoted as such.

"
227. The deictic clitic /k°/ is in all probability etymologically identical with the
element /k°-/ which occurs in all the indefinite and non-present forms of the articles
(see 189). Unlike /na/ and /Pi/ it serves strictly temporal or circumstantial — and
never local — purposes. Its meaning corresponds to that of English 'now' or 'then'
when these words are used to convey that a certain point in time has been or is being
reached, or that a certain state has set in; /k°/ corresponds therefore also to English
'already'. Examples: / n a w , k ° w u a w c ' i c > a l p 7 'he has started to work', 'he is already
working', 'he is working now' (cf. /na w .ua w c > ic > a l p > / 'he is working'), / 5 - n w k ° w
pVty 'I'm sober now', / n a _ k 0 w k > 0 a ' s i ta^n*na'X5, . 5-n w k°_X3'l?/ 'now my

X y i ' ? / 'it's getting dark (now)', / n a w k ° w r a i q > 0 / 'it's dark (now)'. It can also
refer to anticipated events: /5ia'X. C-n^k°wX,>x°31t ta w sni'5im/ 'I'll soon /fcia'X,/

M A P OF THE SALISH LANGUAGE AREA
                                        PREFACE
The Squamish tribe, a subdivision of the Coast Salish stock of North America, at
one time inhabited the area around Howe Sound and along the banks of the lower
Squamish River and Cheakamus Creek in southern British Columbia. More re-
cently they spread to the shores of English Bay, False Creek and Burrard Inlet as
far as Seymour Creek on the northern and Coal Harbour on the southern bank. 1
Their neighbors were the Sechelt in the west, the Lillooet in the north and northeast,
and Halcomelem-speaking tribes in the south and southeast. Their first contact
with white men occurred in the summer of 1792 when Captain Vancouver sailed
into English Bay and Howe Sound, an event still retained by popular memory (see
text IV). Early white settlers estimated the number of the Squamish at several
thousands.2 The tribe was decimated by a succession of smallpox epidemics, and
was reduced to a few hundred at the end of the 19th century. Though since then
the population has increased,3 the language is now close to extinction: it is spoken
only by older people (number unknown) most of whom are living in the Vancouver
area.
    A classification of the Salish languages was made by Swadesh on the basis of a
lexicostatistical analysis of comparative vocabularies in the Boas Collection of the
American Philosophical Society.4 This classification, which progresses from Divi-
sions to Branches, Groups and Languages, is quoted below with some changes and
additions. A few alternative designations are given in parentheses. Where Swadesh's
groups encompass more than one language, his group-names may cause confusion,
being identical with group-member names. In these cases they are replaced by other
names where such have been proposed; otherwise they are left out and the group
is identified by an Arabic numeral only. In some groups a number of language-
names have been added for practical reasons, and the languages within each group
are listed without further bracketing. In the case of the Halcomelem (II B2) as well1

languages referred to with one and the same name by all speakers.8 This may be
the case in one or more of the other groups too. For the geographical distribution
of the languages see the map on p. 6.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"
"257. ""There is"" in the sense of mere existence or being available is expressed /ci?/:
/ci'?-x°_?u/ 'is there (any) left?' (see 230 and 241), answer: /ci?-x0/ '(yes) there is
(some) left'. The same word is used to express the existence of an object possessed,
'I have a house' being phrased 'there is a house of mine': /ci1? k°8ciw n Ja'm?/ 'I have
a house', also /ci1? ti w n»la'm?/ (when the house can be pointed out close-by, or
when the speaker is in it), also without article /ci1? nJa'ni?/; /ci'?_?u k°i > _?-la l m?/
'do you have a house?'. When the (personal) possessor is referred to explicitly, a
construction with a possessive adjunct (see 263) is used: /ci1? k°3ci^la'm? X'a^Ta'm/
'Tom has a house'.
   ""There is no ..."" is expressed /hayq/, see 303.

258. Nominal expressions may be simple or complex.
   A simple nominal expression can consist of any of the forms of the nominal
paradigm (see 130), of an /Pas-/ derivative (see 163-166), of a nominal substitute
(see 199), or of a combination of demonstrative substitute plus any of the above.
Examples: /ti'ua/ 'this one', /ta w la'm?/ 'the house', /ta'j? la'm?/ 'that house',
/ta^?as-(h)ii'/ 'the big one', /s-uat/ 'who', /k°i w na w ta l ?-s/ 'the (unknown) one who
made it', /ti_na w ta'?-s-t-as/ 'this one which he made', / k ° i _ n a ^ q ° s h a 'jaPni !?n-
t-umi/ 'the (unknown) one who pierced your ears'.
   A complex nominal expression comprises more than one stress-group, not counting
a demonstrative substitute as first member. Such an expression consists of a nominal
head (usually a simple noun) with one or more adjuncts. Adjuncts may precede the
head, in which case they are called attributive, or they may follow the head, in which
case they are either appositional or independent. We speak of an oppositional adjunct
when the head of the adjunct has the same referent as the head of the whole nominal
expression, and of an independent adjunct when this is not the case.","[174, 175]"
"223. The auxiliary /2-/ is a reduced form of the verbal root /5a(?)/ 'do, act, make'.

at the same time posits a fact (which, to be sure, may be questioned, denied or made
hypothetical by the use of further clitics): /5-n w ?i'tut/ 'I /-n/ sleep' vs. /Pi'tut-an/
'shall I sleep (or do something else)?'. The latter predicate, with the personal suffix
added to the stem itself, and without /£-/, lacks the fact-positing quality of the,
former.
   A positive answer to a question beginning with /nw a u w 5-x°.../ or / n w o u w £ - a p . . . /
'do you (s., pi.) ...?', can be given with /2-a'n/ 'I do', /5-a't/ 'we do', e.g. / n ^ a u ^
5-x° w ua w i3U?i'n?c — 5-a'n/ 'Do you understand? — Yes (I do)'.
   The complexes /5-n, S-t, 5-x°, 5-a(ja)p/ could easily be interpreted as personal
pronouns for subject on the basis of such paradigms as /p'i'Pt-ka/ 'grab it!' (/-ka/
imperative suffix), /C-n. ,pJi'?t/ 'I grab it', /5-x° w p'i l ?t/ 'you grab it', etc. Such a
fusion must account for the 1st pers. plur. possessive suffix /-Cat/ 'our' (see 125).

"
                              E. AD-HOC NOMINALIZATIONS324. It is characteristic of the verb-forms in /k°i/-clauses that the nominalizer /s-/ is
added to a preceding clitic when one is present, e.g. /C-n^ua^Pasna't k°i w n-STna w ,
ua w c > ic > a l p'/ 'I work at night', lit. 'I am nocturnal in the matter of my being at work'.
There is a different category of cases where the nominalizer /s-/ is added to the verb-
stem, and where clitics precede this complex, e.g. /na w ui'lq >0 tcasuit q w sta'm-as
k°iv_,nav_,uas^n-s-c>ic>alp>/ 'they asked me what kind of work I was doing'. In this
case, /s-c'ic'a'p'/ can be taken as the noun 'work, job', so that the above sentence
may be rendered literally 'they asked me what it was, that which was being my work'.
Such a phrase of clitic(s) plus nominalized verb-form can take any article, e.g.
/x°i_na l 5 > k°3ci w na w ua s ^n-s-c > ic > a l p > / 'I am working on a different job now', lit.
'different now is that which is being my work'. However, unlike /s-c'ic'a'p'/, several
such nominalizations are found only in this type of complexes, so that the latter must
be regarded as constructions ad hoc, and not as combinations involving regular nouns.
   Here follows a list of all cases of predicative clitic + /s-/-derivative that were
recorded, subdivided according to whether the verb-stem is (a) intransitive other
than passive, (b) transitive or (c) passive. Where non-nominalized personal forms of
the stems involved were recorded, these are quoted first in parentheses.",[202]
"152. Note that in general reduplicated roots CV /Ca-Ca, Cu-Cu, Ci-Ci/ can be
described both as total reduplications /Cah-Csh/, etc., and as partial reduplications
/Ca-Ch/, etc. (type Partial II, see 155). In addition, a case like /ia'Pja/, probably =
/ia'hP-ish/ parallel to /ma'nP-mn/ (cf. the simplicia /ja?, man?/), could also be de-
scribed as belonging to the rare type Partial V, see 158. Roots with /i/ could also be
described as belonging to the rare type Partial IV, see 157. We have classed all these
cases as total reduplications. Cf. also 150.
104                                          MORPHOLOGY                        B. PARTIAL (INITIAL) REDUPLICATION
The general type is CV-C(V)C, subdivided on the basis of the vocalism of root- and
reduplication-syllable as follows:
                     I. /QA^CiAxCjj/: /Ca-CaC, Ci-CiC, Cu-CuC/
                    II. /QA-QCj,/:    /Ca-CC, Ci-CC, Cu-CC/
                   ni. /oc^oocy
                   IV. / C j i - C ^ C , /
                    v. / q v p - q o o q /
In a few instances of type II, C 2 is represented by /i/, which appears as /i?/ in the
root-syllable of the reduplicated form.
  Type III parallels both I and II: it concerns roots with /a/, or with /a, i, u/ which
— precisely because they are reduplicated by /Ca-/ — are considered to represent
*/ah, aj, au/.
  Type I, III and V, when derived from monosyllabic stems, have the stress on the
reduplication-syllable; in the case of suffixed stems the stress can also fall on the
suffix or, more rarely, on the root-syllable.
   In type II the vowel of the reduplication-syllable is often identical with that of the
vocalized form of the root, e.g., /p'a-p'k 0 / 'float' (Vp'ak 0 -), /?3s-li'-I?x°/ 'lying
(down)' (Vlix 0 -), /Sui-§p-n/ 'whistle' (\/3up-).
   From a semantic point of view, there are four categories of cases where partial
initial reduplication plays a role: (1) in durative, frequentative or intensive verb-
derivatives, (2) in diminutive derivations, (3) in /Pas-/ derivatives of verbs and (4) in
the numerals used to count animals. The latter two categories are also treated
separately under their respective headings (see 166, 213). There are, in addition, a
large number of cases where reduplicative formations have become lexicalized.
   The durative, frequentative and intensive verb-derivatives belong for the most part
to type I and III, the /Pas-/ derivatives to type II and III (for some cases of total
reduplication in /Pas-/ derivatives see 167).","[103, 104]"
"241. The suffix /-x°/ means 'still, yet (as previously)'. It is sometimes added both to a
predicative clitic and to the predicate-word itself. Examples: /na'?-x0 uaw?3sXi'c(-x°)/
'he's still lying down' (cf. /na_ua w ?asXi'c/ 'he's lying down'), /na'?-x°-uit/ 'they're
still there', /hi'n?-x°^£-n k°i_n-s-?i'/ 'I'll be here for a long time yet', lit. 'I'll be a
long time yet in (the matter of) my being here', /?i'-x 0 w ?u Pa'j.nax0/ 'is he alive yet?',
/5-n w ?i 'tut-a 'XXa-x0/ 'I'm not hungry yet', lit. 'I sleep-throat yet', /ci'?-x°_?u/ 'is
there any left?', /ci?-x°/ '(yes,) there is'.
   The suffix /-x°/ forms part of the word /x°u?a 'x°/ 'it is not yet the case' < */x°-hay-x°/
(cf. /hau/ 'it is not the case', 'no'; for initial /x°-/ see 179:10).
   See Syntax 349.

242. There is only a small number of words which do not fit the morphological and
syntactic pattern of nouns and verbs. They fall into three groups: conjunctions,
adverbs and interjections. Some of these elements are identical with clitics, and many
consist of petrified combinations of the latter. With regard to adverbs it must be
noted that Squamish generally uses verbs where English has adverbs, cf. such typical
cases as 'not' and 'very', rendered in Squamish by the verbs /hau/ 'be not the case',
'do not' and /Pan/ 'be or act to a high degree'. The marginal words are listed in the
next section; for examples of use see Dictionary and sections of Syntax referred to.","[164, 165]"
"265. A predicative independent adjunct consists of any expression following a
""quotational"" noun or nominal verb-form (verba sentiendi, declarandi or appellandi)
and explicitly stating the thought, utterance or name it refers to. Examples:
/ti_cu'ntas sasi'PX sk°ca'?s/ 'this (thing) he thought (to be) a floating island' (IV:2),
/k°3ci w cu'ntasuit sk°cal?s/ 'the (thing) they thought (to be) an island' (IV: 6),
/ t i ^ n a ^ u a ^ c u ' n t m n a w u a w t a X i i ' ? u t y 'the one they thought to be eating fire',

178                                        SYNTAX                                   D. USE OF ARTICLES266. In the large majority of cases the (nominal) predicate lacks an article, while the
expressions for subject, object and other nominal relata are provided with them. For
examples see the sentences quoted in 244ff. Only when a class-noun is used to refer
to an individual as such, an article is used in the nominal predicate, e.g. /ta w ?3s(h)ii'
n-sX'i'P/ 'I want the big one', 'it is the big one I want'. An ""individualizing"" nominal
predicate referring to a 3rd person is usually introduced by /niX/ (see 252), e.g.
/ni'X ta w ?3s(h)ii' n-sX'i1?/ 'I want the big one'. With personal substitutes no article
is used: /Pa'ns n a ^ t a ' P s / ' / made it', 'it's me who made it' (note that in all other
syntactic positions these substitutes are provided with articles, see 201). An article
is also lacking in a nominal predicate with a possessive affix (all examples preceded by
/niX/):/ni'X n-k°u'pic ta'i?/'that's my (elder) brother',/ni'X n-sua1? ti 1 /'this one is
mine'. Proper names behave in the same way as personal substitutes: /Pi'ta
na w k >0 a'5.n3x°as t a ^ T a ' m / 'it is Peter who saw Tom'; this is also true when the
name refers to itself: /Pi'ta k°i s _na^ua w s-na'ntcasuit/ 'Peter is what they call me'.","[177, 178]"
"                                 Definite — Indefinite190. The definite forms are used for objects which are individually identified for the
speaker in an independent way. The Squamish definite category therefore differs
from the English one in two ways. In the first place, in English the object must be
definite for the hearer also: one begins a report with 'I met a man ...' (the man is
identified for me but not yet for the hearer); in this case Squamish will use a definite
form. On the other hand, in English one uses the definite article in cases where the
object is defined for the speaker in a way which depends on the description exclusively:
'who is the man you met?' (the man is identified for me merely by the description
'(which) you met', but not independently — I could not point him out); in such cases
Squamish uses an indefinite form.
13S                                        MORPHOLOGY  In some cases the mere impossibility of the object's conceivably being pointed out
by the speaker allows or necessitates the use of an indefinite form, even though the
object is independently identified for the speaker. Such is the case with references to
deceased relatives, and to past and future time-periods.
  Factual forms (see 133f.) require the indefinite article /k°i/ in subordinate clauses,
see 275-283.","[137, 138]"
"
                                   B. APPOSmVE ADJUNCTS259. An appositive adjunct may in the first place be represented by any form of the
nominal paradigm, these forms referring to the head of the whole noun plus adjunct
construction (in the case of transitive forms, the object has the same referent as the
head of the whole construction). Examples: with a noun /k°aci w ,si?a l m? sm3i°i l ys/
'chief smallpox' (a term of respect resulting from fear), cf. also the last example in 261;
with itr. verbs: /k°3ci w sui'?qa na w nam w papi?a'tuX,/ 'the man who went hunting',
/ti^mi'XaX ?i w h9m?i'/ 'the bear that was coming (at me)' (V:20), /PaXi^sX'a'lqm
n a w n a l n a m ? / 'that monster that is going about' (111:8), /k°3ci w sta'y?x°X
na w mn w tx°k > 0 i l nk > 0 n/ 'the children few of whom were left', lit. 'that had become
few' (1:19), / ^ a c i ^ n - u a ' C n a w x ° i ' ? / 'my watch that is lost'; with a tr. verb: /sni'Sim
ua^Xa'lPtan/ '(the) words I am writing down'. The appositive adjunct may be a
phrase headed by a nominal form: /k°i w ia l 5u? n a w u a w t > a ' ? t a s k°3X,iwSilnuXqai?/
'the lakes which S. tried' (111:24), /k°i w sX > a l lqm y a w n a ' n t m Si'nulqai?/ 'a monster
called S.' (111:4), /k°i...§a'y? x ' W s t a s ^ P a q ' tx°na'm? tk°i w 5ma l n/ 'a bone which
he would use against enemies' (111:37); with a relator-verb plus relatum: / t a w l a ' m ?
n a ^ n a 1 ? (t-)ta^?i'Xaqa/ 'the house on the other side' (alternative / t a w l a ' m ?
t a ^ n a w ? i ' X a q a / ) . For an adjunct-phrase headed by a simple noun see the last
example of 261.",[176]
"231. The modal clitic /q/ marks a predicate as irreal in the widest sense of the word.
It comprises facts which are yet to occur (English 'when' referring to the future),
facts that are supposed (English 'if') or suggested ('do you think that...?'), and facts
that are denied (all negative sentences). In this way, both /?u/ and /q/ can mark
conditional phrases, and sometimes both can translate the same English 'if'-phrase:
/?u w ha'?k/ and /q w (h)a'?X-as/ can both correspond to 'if it's good', but they do
so on the basis of different meanings. The clitic /?u/ adds a sign 'given the condition
that ...' to a predicate expressing a fact; /q/ presents the fact itself as not (yet) real,
and the second phrase just quoted means rather 'when it will be good', 'should it
(turn out to) be good'. The expression of an irreal condition requires the use of
both conditional /?u/ and irreal /q/. Here follow a few examples of /q/-clauses:
/?i l tut w 5-x° q^Pas^qa'np ta w sn3'q°m/'goto sleep /Pi 'tut/ when the sun/sn3'q°m/
goes down /qanp/', /k°a'il qwc>ic>a'p'-as/ 'he's going to work tomorrow', lit.
'tomorrow (is) when he will work', /qw?ax°^,X.q>il?s, ha'nst-c w 5-x 0 / 'if you know

"                                     Present — Non-Present
196. Within the definite category, which may be said to refer to objects which could
conceivably be pointed out by the speaker, there is a distinction between that which
can be pointed out, more exactly, which is an element of immediate experience, in the
speech-situation (present), and that which is not (non-present). Thus, one says /hamPi1
k ° a w T a ' m / 'Tom will come' (said in answer to the question 'will Tom come?') but
/ n a w k ° w h a m ? i ' t a _ T a ' m / 'Tom is coming' (/na/ 'there', /k°/ 'now'; said when
Tom is seen approaching); /C-n^q^u'irnax 0 k°3ciwmilXaX, k°i, .CIPa'qX./ 'I killed
a /k°aci/ bear /mi'XaX./ yesterday'; /t'i'q 0 k ° a w ? a l c q / 'it's cold outside', lit. 'cold (is)
the outdoors' (said inside the house); / ? i ^ u a w t x ° n 6 a ? a l m ? k ° a w P i l t a / 'how is
Peter (absent)?'.
    When the referent of a word is the class and not a specimen, the present form is
used: /na w ua_n-s-?ip > a l q > 0 aX ta w mi l Xaty 'I'm afraid of bears', lit. 'it is my
fearing, the bear', /6-n w qi'-s ta w sXa l m?x°/ 'I dislike rain'.
    The categories present and non-present are of the unmarked-marked type. The
present forms can be used for things absent (in the same way as in English the present
can be substituted for the past tense), but not vice versa. In stories (as opposed to
conversations which are strongly bound to the here-and-now), present forms often
creep in: the speaker momentarily shifts his frame of reference from the speech-
situation to that of the story. For instance, in text V the canoe is referred to with
/k°aciI in 3, 8 and 19 but with /ta/ in 16; the bear is referred to with /k°aci/ in 4, 10,
18, 21, 22, but with /ti/ in 11 and 20.",[139]
"308. Type Ila comprises furthermore local clauses (English '(the place) where ...');
unlike the causal variety treated above, these clauses are often found in positions
where an article is required. Examples: /nas_^uilPx°m t-k°3ci s _ua^X,-S3t w ta l P5n/

                                  Demonstrative     Substitutes202. For the 3rd pers. sing, the strong deictic forms discussed in 198 are used. The
proximal forms /ti, ci/ can be extended with an element /-ua/: /ti'(-ua), ci'(-ua)/
'this one (masc. and fem.)'. The 3rd pers. plur. has for the present category the
proximal form /?i'a 2 uit/ and the distal form /Pi'ci^uit)/ or /Pi'ici(2uit)/. For the
non-present category the plural derivation /k°a'ci 2 uit/ is used; there is, besides, a
form /q°a' 2 uit/, with an initial /q°/ instead of expected /k%
    Examples: /qs'i ta'i?/ 'he (or: that one there) is bad'; /sua't^maX. ta'i?/ 'who is
that?'; / X q ' i ' ? - s ^ ? u ^ > x 0 ta1!?/ 'do you know him (there)?'; /5a'-n-m Pa'Xi/ 'what

(there) abandoned their house(s)'; /na > _k 0 w ?asq > i l q > i 2 i'm? q°a' 2 uit/ 'they (absent)
are camping now'.
    The 3 sing, forms /ti, taj?, kVci/ are also used to refer to place, time and manner:
/ n a w y a w n a ' P t-ta'i?/ 'he's over there', /na'? t-k°3'ci/ 1. 'at that place', 'there',
2. 'at that time', 'then', /timPa1 t-ti', ~ t-ta'i?, ~ t-k°3'ci/ 'hke this, like that'. The
word /t-ti'(ya)/ is used for 'here' and 'hither': /mi'-ka t-ti'/ 'come here!', / n a w y a w ? i '
t-ti'/ 'he is here' (the root /Pi/ by itself means 'be here').
    Reference to a more distant location which can be pointed at is made with
/ti_?i'na/ 'yonder': / n a w u a ^ n a ' ? (t-)ti w ?i'na/ 'he's over yonder' (for /?ina/
see 208).
    Reference to a non-present (invisible) location is made with /k°ia'/, e.g. / n a w u a ^
na1? t-k°ia/ 'he's over there'.

 203. The word /niX/ combines the functions of anaphoric pronoun and copula. It
 is used to refer to a thing, time, place or fact on which the addressee has already
 focused his attention, or which he can readily identify as a result of situational or
 contextual factors. It can often be translated 'it is (was)', 'that is (was)', pi. /ni'X-uit/
 'they are (were)'; in particular, it stands for 'that's' in 'that's (what ...)', 'that's
 (who ...)', 'that's (when ...)', 'that's (where ...)', 'that's (how ...), 'that's (why ...)'.
The word /niX/ does not itself require a pointing gesture, but when it refers to persons
 or things it is often supported by a 3rd pers. demonstrative.
    Examples: /sua't w maX ta'i? — ni'X n-k°u'pic/ 'Who is that (there)? — It (that)
is my (elder) brother'; /ni'X n-k°u'pic ti'ua/ 'this is my brother' (introduction), lit.
'it is my brother, this one'; /ni'X ta'i?/ 'that's him', /ni'X. Pa'li/ 'that's her',

"274. Combinations of a clitic /£-, na, ?i, ua, nam(?), m(?)i, x°i/ with a following verb
are constructions of main verb + verbal relatum in which the main verb has lost its
stress and, to a greater or lesser degree, its concrete lexical meaning, cf. the full verbs
/5a'?-t/ 'make; tr.', /£a'-n-m/ 'do what?', /na'?/ 'be there', /Pi'/ 'be here', /ua^u/
'continue' (a reduplication of /ua/), /na'm?/ 'go', /m(?)i, ham?i'/ 'come', /x°3'j/
'appear'. A predicate like /5-n_ua w su l k > 0 um/ 'I am bathing, I habitually take
baths', now an imperfective counterpart to /5-n w su l k'°um/ 'I take a bath', 'I will
take a bath (right now)' goes back to */6-n w ua'? Su'k^um/ 'I act continuously (in)
bathing', where */ua'?/ is the main verb and /5u'k>0um/ the verbal relatum. This
state of affairs survives in several ways in the contemporary language. In the first
place, clitics occasionally have a stress of their own (see 2). In the second place,
certain suffixes are attached to clitics. The imperative suffix /-ka/ is always attached
to a clitic /nam(?), m(?)i/ when one is present, e.g. /nam-ka_?mu l t/ 'sit down!'
(said to a person standing), /mi-ka w ?mu't/ 'arise!' (said to a person lying), lit.
'assume a sitting posture'; notice the parallelism with /qi?a't-ka Ai'C'it/ or /Xi'C'it-ka
qi?a't/ 'cut it again!'. The suffix /-x°/ 'still, yet' (241) can be attached to clitic or
full verb or both. The plural suffixes /-uit, -jap/ are attached either to a clitic /na, ?i/
or to the verb they accompany, e.g. /na w k°a'i-uit/ or /na-uit^.k°a 'j/ 'they hide'
/na^ua^c'icVp'-uit/ or /na-uit w ,ua w c > ic > a l p > / 'they are working', /Pi,               ,
c'ic'a'p'-uit/ or /?i-uit w k° w c > ic > a l p > / 'they are starting to work now' (cf. also the
2nd pers. plur. form of the non-initial paradigm quoted in 135).

 275. A subordinate member of a sentence may itself be an independent predicative
 expression, i.e. one where neither subject nor object, nor any other relatum has
 necessarily the same referent as the main predicate, but where the fact itself is a
 referent of the main predicate (as in ""I know (the fact) that A helps B"" versus "" I
 know (him) who helps B"" or ""... whom A helps""). In Squamish such expressions are
 rendered by forms of the factual paradigm (133) preceded by the article /k°i/, and
 they are referred to as /k°i/-clauses. The fact expressed by such a clause may play the
 role of subject to the main predicate (""That A helps B pleases me""), or that of object
 (""I know that A helps B"") or that of some other relatum (""I am surprised that A
helps B""), and in the latter case even a literal English translation often has to have
recourse to expressions other than the conjunction ""that"", such as ""while"", ""when"",
 ""as regards"", ""in the matter of"", ""in order to"", etc. On the other hand, all /k°i/-
clauses have in common that no single referent of the clause can play the role of
subject or object of the main predicate. Where S or O of the English subordinate
clause play this role (cf. the 2nd and 3rd examples above, and also ""(He) who helps B
is my friend"", ""(He) whom A helps wins the game"") Squamish has recourse to forms
of the nominal paradigm (130). Where some other aspect of the English subordinate
clause plays the role of S or O (as in "" I know (the reason) why, (the time) when,
(the way) how, (the one) with whom A helps B"", or in ""The reason why A helps B
surprises me"", etc.) Squamish has recourse to /^/-clauses (304-312). There remain,
then, all those clauses which — elegantly or not — can be turned into expressions
with ""the fact that"" (""while"" = ""during the fact that"") or with a construction
""A's helping B"" (""while A helped B"" = ""during A's helping B""); these constitute the
domain of /k°i/-clauses. Note that the /k°i/-clause does not express explicitly the
temporal notion ""during"" in these examples: the choice between the interpretations
""that"", ""while"", ""in order to"", etc., depends on the context.
   At first glance, certain /k°i/-clauses might be taken for nominal expressions taking
the position of S or O. For instance, in /hi'nP^Pit' k°i^n-STna'?/ 'I'll be away (lit.
""there"") for a long time' the phrase /k'i^n-Srna 1 ?/ could be translated 'my being
there' and regarded as the subject of /hi'nP^PitV 'it will be long'; and in
184                                         SYNTAX/C-n^ma'i.nax 0 k^^n-STmi'st-an/ 'I have forgotten to bring it' the phrase
/k°iwn-STinilst-an/ (/mi-s/ 'bring', lit. 'cause to come; tr.') could be translated 'my
bringing it' and regarded as the object of /S-n^ma'j.nax 0 / 'I have forgotten it; tr.'.
But in /iia'i-ka k^iPsOs-S'i'nt-ax 0 / 'lift it a little bit', lit. 'act sligtly in the matter
of your lifting it', the phrase /k°i s _s5'i l ntax7 cannot be interpreted as the object of
/6ia '¿-ka/, the latter being intransitive, nor can it be taken as the subject, for /Siaj-ka/
is addressed to a 2nd person and can be replaced by /5ia'i^,<5ax0/ (see 239). Notice,
furthermore, that /k°i^,s5>ilntax°/ cannot be described as a nominal secondary
relatum (270), since in this case it would have to be in the relative case, with /t-k°i/
rather than /k°i/. Therefore, these subordinate expressions constitute a category
sui generis. Interestingly, closely parallel sentences may differ precisely with regard
to the possibility of interpreting a /k°i/-clause as a subject, e.g., 'I cannot see it' can
be expressed /?3sk>0a'i k°iwn-s-k>°al£.nax°-an/ 'impossible is my seeing it' or
alternatively /6-n w ,?3sk'°a l i k°iwn-s-k>0al6.n9x°-an/, lit. 'I am impotent in the matter
of my seeing it'; in the former case (objective impossibility) the subordinate predicate
could be interpreted as the subject of the main predicate, in the latter case (subjective
impossibility) it cannot. Obviously, the former case, too, can be taken to mean 'there
is an impossibility as regards my seeing it', i.e. /?3sk>0a'i/ can be interpreted as an
impersonal verb, and in the same way /hi'n?, Pit1 k°i w ns.na'?/ (see above) can be
interpreted as 'there will be a long passage of time in the matter of my being there'.
From a Squamish point of view the latter translations are preferable: they allow a
uniform rendering of all /k°i/-clauses regardless of whether or not they allow an
interpretation as S or O (see also 276 fn. and 308 fn.). But in giving ""literal"" trans-
lations I have been using the simpler alternative, and I will continue to do so where
this is convenient. Note that with nominal main predicates, which allow a subject
only (to the exclusion of other relata), the question simply does not arise: in /Pn-sH 1 ?
k°i^n-s-(h)uja 1 ?/ 'I want to leave' it would be far-fetched to translate 'there is a
wish of mine as regards my leaving' — the translation 'my desire (is) my leaving'
suffices.
   In the following sections examples of /k°i/-clauses are quoted. They are subdivided
on the basis of the inclusion of clitics in the factual form (see 135). The clitics which
may occur in such forms are /ua, na/, the combination / n a ^ u a / , and /nam(?), m(?)i/.
In general, factual forms without clitic or with /ua/ refer to present or future events,
forms with / n a ^ u a / to present or past events, and forms with /na/ to past events
(for the cases with /nam(?), m(?)i/, which have no relation to time, see 280). Note
the morphophonemic details mentioned in 135 (non-initial paradigm).276. /k°i/-clauses without predicative clitics. With intransitive verbs: /Pn-sW?

234. The directional clitics /nam(?)/ 'go', /m(?)i/ 'come' and /x°i/ 'appear' are
etymologically identical with the full verbs /nam?, (ha)mPi', x°ajj; the first two often
lose their /?/ when used as clitics. The clitics /nam, mi/ in many cases correspond to
English 'go' and 'come' in such expressions as 'I'll go and get it', 'I'm going to do it',
'come have a look', 'come on, do it', etc.; in other cases they function as more general

"162. In a few instances consonants are reduplicated without intervening vowel
(see 46). There are three examples in word-initial position: /5'5'us/ 'sand-flies' (IJ),
'no-see-um' (AP), /5'Cu'X/ 'collar-bone' (in the pronunciation of Mrs. AP; IJ and AP
/CiC'u'ty), and /n.na?/ in the phrase / u a _ X - s w u a w n . n a ' ? / 'where they (persons)

163. The non-personal affixes comprise a few prefixes and a large number of suffixes.
    Among the prefixes there are three which have a semi-grammatical character and a
wide range of application, warranting separate treatment: these are the ""participial""
prefix /?as-/ and the local-directional prefixes /n(ax°)-/ and /tx 0 -/. Of the remaining
prefixes, each one constitutes a type by itself, and they are listed alphabetically, with
appropriate comments. Some of them are mere formatives.
   The suffixes are summed up in three groups: somatic suffixes, non-somatic suffixes,
and formatives.
    Some remarks must be made here which concern affixes in general. As was
mentioned in 79, affixes may be nominalizing, verbalizing or neutral. An affix is
nominalizing if in combination with verbal stems it consistently yields nouns, and
verbalizing if with nominal stems it consistently yields verbs. As neutral are con-
sidered affixes which can yield both nouns and verbs, or the occurrence of which is
limited to one of these classes, the affixed form belonging to the same class as the
simplex.
    Here follow examples of the various possibilities:
   (1) Verbal stem + nominalizing affix: /Xa'IP-tn/ 'pencil', cf. /Xsl?/ 'write; itr.',
/-tn/ 'implement'; /A.ul-A,uq>0-aj?/ 'arbutus', cf. Auq >0 / 'cast one's skin; itr.' (here
reduplicated), /-aj?/ 'tree, bush'.
   (2) Nominal stem + verbalizing affix: /s^a'najP-i?/ 'to become a woman', cf.
/s-Xa'naj?/ 'woman', /-i?/ 'become'; /ti-la'm?/ 'build a house', cf. /lam?/ 'house',
/ti-/ 'build, construct'.
   (3) Verbal stem + verbalizing affix: /p'a'S'-i?/ 'become hot', cf. /p'a5'/ 'be hot
and (2) above.
   (4) Nominal stem + nominalizing affix: /t'lm-a'i?/ 'wild cherry tree', cf. /t'a'lm/
'wild cherry' and (1) above.
   (5) Verbal stem -f neutral affix: /Xik,0-q°/ 'get caught on a hook (ab. fish)',
lit. 'hook-head', cf. /\ik'°/ 'get hooked, caught up on something sticking out',
/-q°/ 'head', see (6) below.
   (6) Nominal stem + neutral affix: /§au?-q°/ 'skull', lit. 'bone-head', cf. /Say?/ 'bone'
and (5) above.
                                NON-PERSONAL AFFIXATION                                  111
   (7) Verbal stem + neutral affix: /hi-u'jPs/ 'consist of large pieces, be large-chunked',
cf. /hii1, hi-/ 'be large', /-uj?s/ 'chunk, large piece'; this suffix is added to verbs only.
   (8) Nominal stem + neutral affix: /sx^ma'n/ 'step-father', cf. /man/ 'father', /sx°-/
'step-'; this prefix is added to nouns only.
   Nominalizing and verbalizing affixes are labeled as such; if no comment is given
the affix is neutral. With each affix, all available examples are quoted, except for
cases which are both simple and very common.","[109, 110, 111]"

204. The word /mani'X, ma'ni'X/, pi. /mananPi'X/ is the appositive (not the reflexive!)
'(he) himself', '(they) themselves': /ta w mani'X/ 'he himself', /Pi'ci mananPi'X/ 'they
themselves', /?aXi_mani'X/ 'she herself', /ti w mani'X/ 'this one himself', etc. As far
as the other persons are concerned, a corresponding form could be elicited for the
1st pers. plur. only: /mani'maX/ 'we ourselves': /mani'maX na^ta'Ps/ 'we made it
ourselves' (only example recorded). For the 1st pers. sing, and for the 2nd pers.
there is no corresponding form: one says /Ps'ns na^ta'Ps/ for 'I made it myself' as
well as for 'I am the one who made it'.
                                         SUBSTITUTES                                         145
  Squamish very often uses /mani'X/ where English has a simple personal pronoun
or zero: /cu't PaXi^mani'X. Qa'lqality 'Q. said' (1:8), /?i w na w k° w tx 0 -(h)i'u
k09Xi^,mani'X/ 'again she went upstream' (111:18).
  /mani'X/ is the emphatic form of the clitic /mn/ (see 344). Occasionally it is also
used instead of /ni'X/, e.g. /mani'X ta^,?3-s?a'iqs§n na w ua w k°a l mi?n/ 'those are
your heels thumping' (1:16).
  See Syntax 344.","[144, 145]"
"                              The Subject-Object Paradigms129. Besides the possessive paradigm treated in the preceding section, four other
types of personal paradigms must be distinguished. These are labeled (1) Nominal,
(2) Finite, (3) Hypothetical and (4) Factual. These paradigms concern nouns (a) as
well as intransitive (b) and transitive (c) verbs. Given the noun 'man', the itr. verb
'come' and the tr. verb 'help', the meanings of (1-4) may be roughly described as
follows:
 The nominal forms express the meanings (a) 'man', (b) 'one who comes', (c) 'one
who helps him, me, etc.', 'one whom he, I, etc. help(s)\
88                                    MORPHOLOGY   The finite forms express the meanings (a) 'he, etc., is a man', (b) 'he, etc., comes',
(c) 'he, etc., helps him, etc.'.
   The hypothetical forms express the meanings (a) '(if) he, etc., is a man', (b) '(if) he,
etc., comes', (c) '(if) he, etc., helps him, etc.'.
   The factual forms express the meanings (a) '(that) he, etc., is a man', (b) '(that) he,
etc., comes', (c) '(that) he, etc., helps him, etc.'.
   Nominal forms can be preceded by nominal clitics (articles). Factual forms can be
preceded by the article /k°i/. Hypothetical forms can be preceded by the modal
clitic /qI 'if'. When paradigms are quoted, these clitics are omitted.
   The nominal forms of verbs, and the 3rd pers. subject forms of the finite paradigm
of verbs are often preceded by the predicative clitic /na/ 'there, then'. When
paradigms are quoted, this clitic is included with these forms: it is the feature which
distinguishes nouns from verbs, cf. /sui'Pqa/ 'he is a man' vs. / n a ^ W q / 'he comes'.
The clitic /na/ may also be used in other than 3rd pers. subject forms of the finite
paradigm, but here its occurrence is rare.","[87, 88]"
"46. In a small number of words geminated or long consonants occur. Where these
are found in medial position they are combined with a double stress if one of the
adjacent vowels is /a/, and this /a/ is in several cases irregular in comparison to non-
geminated counterparts of these words (see below). I write these geminates /C.C/,
where /./ fulfills the double function of indicating that the consonants do not merge,
and that the second one is not syllabic (in the cases with /n.n/). Such geminates
occur without double stess in /s-?a't.tam/ 'things, stuff, belongings' (probably a
derivative of /s-tam/ 'what?') and in /PaC.fca'uam/ 'to spawn', /(n-)s-?a5.£a'uam/
'conger eel'. With double stress they occur in four of the numerals referring to days:
/t , 3 l k >0 .k >0 usa l £/ '7 days', with a surprising /a/ in the first syllable, as compared to
/ t ' a k ' W C / '7', /ta'q.qa'5/ '8 days', cf. /tqa8/ '8', /Pu'p.pa'n/ '10 days', cf. /Pu'pn/ '10'
and /ci'ja'Cis = ca'i.ja'iis/ [-e - 'ja - '] '5 days', /s-ci'ja'Cis/ 'Friday', cf. /ci'afcis/ 'five';
without double stress in the numeral /?a'n.n?us/ '2 animals' (possibly a misrecording
for */?a'?n?us/, see 213). Further in two non-numerical words: /nax'-ua'u.ya'nm/
[-ua'u^ua -1 -] 'be surprised', /tina'n.na'Pt/ in the expression /\}a^n.X w tina , n.na l ?t/
[uAnXtene'nna'Pt] 'my deceased father', lit. 'the past one I am from', cf. /tina1?/ 'be
from' (where /ti-/ means 'from' and /na?/ '(be) at').
                                    SPECIAL QUESTIONS                                     41  In a few cases geminates occur word-initially, e.g. in the phrase /ua^,X»sw u a w n.na'?/
'where they (persons) were'; here /n.na1?/ is a form of the morpheme /na?/ 'at'
mentioned above. Since reference to persons in several cases entails reduplication
in Squamish, gemination is considered to be a special type of reduplication (see 162).
In the medial cases, the reduplication is the primary phenomenon, from which the
double stress and the appearance of /s/ in unexpected places result.","[40, 41]"
"218. Of the above suffixes, /-uj?s, -qs, -mut/ are added to the independent forms of
the numerals 1-3, /-ax°iX./ takes the alternants /na£'-, cam-, San-/; I have no data on
/-ajum?/. Examples: /nS'u'P-uiPs, nS'u'P-qs, nS'u'P-mut/ but /na'C'-ax^X,, ca'm-ax°iX,
Ca'n-ax°iX/ (and further with the stress on the suffix /XaPucn-alx°iX, cia5is-a'x°iV. etc.).
   The element /nC'u?, naC1-/ 'one' is also used in the sense '(the) one', '(the) other'
(see 207); in this sense, suffixed forms can be followed by a specifying noun, e.g.
/k°3ciwnal5,-au?tx° la'm? X'a^Pi'ta/ 'one of Peter's houses /lam?/' (also /k°3ci_
nfc'u1? la'm? Va^Pi'ta).
   To sum up, the special alternants /nai1-, cam-, San-/ for '1, 2, 3' are used with the
suffixes /-(au2)iS/ '100'. /-ax°/ 'x times' (NB. /cam-a1/ 'twice'), /-jas/ 'days', /-au?tx°/
'house', /-ax°iX,/ 'container', probably also with /-auanax0/ 'year' (cf. the two above
cases with /-au-/).
                                           XVIII                                   RELATOR-VERBS
219. There are a number of verbs which imply a complement in the relative case (if
expressed). Semantically, these verbs correspond to English prepositions. The
complement is not always expressed explicitly: it may be absent where context or
situation leave no room for doubt (in the same way as in English ""he went along
with X"" can be replaced by ""he went along"" when X's going somewhere has just
been mentioned).","[152, 153]"
"The Prefix /tx0-/178. The prefix /tx°-/ indicates direction (a) with verbs of motion and (b) with stems
referring to the goal or effect of a motion or change. The prefix may be compared to
English "" a - "" in prepositions (along, above, about) and adverbs (afire, awash, adrift)
where these are used in combination with verbs of motion or change.
   Examples (a) with verbs of motion: /tx°»nam?/ 'go, move along', as a relator-
verb (219) 'with a view to, for (something desired), against (something disliked)',
also used as comparison-word '...er than'; reduplicated /tx°TnaLnam?/ 'be gone',
as a relator-verb'toward, in the direction of'; /tx0-(h3)m?i', tx°»m?i/ '(come) hither
to'; /tx0-5a'-n-m/ 'go where?' (see 211); /tx^t'ax0/ 'move out of', /tx°-&>Xq7 'move
through'.
   Examples (b) with verbs referring to the result of a motion or change: /tx°-q'ai/
'(go) on top of, onto' (cf. /q'ai/ 'be on top'), /tx^x^si 1 ?/ '(go) between' (cf. /x^Si 1 ?/
'be between'), /tx°-iuty '(land) into the fire' (cf. /juX/ 'burn'), /tx°-palq°/ 'fall on one's
knees' (cf. /plq0-a'm/ 'kneel'), etc. Note particularly /tx°-(h)ui/ 'be all that remains',
'be left over' (cf. /hui/ 'be finished'), /tx°-(h)au/ 'be no longer the case, no more'
(cf. /hau/ 'be not the case', 'not', 'no').
   In a few cases /tx°-/refers to a subject of discussion: /tx°-t3'-ta/ 'discuss', /tx°-?i'nat/
'be about what?' (said about speech).
   In /tx°-n632a'm?/ 'be how (much)?' (see 210) the directional sense of /tx°-/ is
practically lost, but cf. the various uses of English ""up to"".
   In principle, /tx°-/ can be added to any stem, the combination meaning 'achieve
the state of ...'. A person who has lost much weight can say /in^mn^tx^a'u?/
'I'm all bone /5au?/ now'. All cases recorded are found in the Dictionary under /tx0-/-                                        Other Prefixes179:1. /m-/ (formative) can be isolated in /s-m*us/ 'head' (cf. suff. /-us/ 'face'); the
glottalization may be junctural but can also go back to */?am/. An initial /m-/ is
found in a number of words referring to parts of the body: /ma'qsn/ 'nose' (cf. suff.
/-qs/ 'nose'), which may contain /m-/ by itself but can also go back to */maq-qs-n/,
cf. the next example: /maq-allx°caX/ 'tongue'; /s-mac'-a'l-qn/ 'brain'; /ma'sn/ 'gall';
/m3'X°-ia/ 'navel' (cf. also /s-ma^-i'us/ 'smallpox', possibly from a \/ni3X0 'dimple,
mark'); /mii'u-/ 'side' (orig. meaning probably somatic).

(see 169) with which it is in some cases interchangeable. Sometimes forms with and
without /x°-/ coexist. It occurs in a few geographical names: /xSma'cklam/
'Musqueam' (according to AP the Musqueam dialect has /x°.m3 'sk0iam/), /x^ma 'lc'stn/

"36. Vowel-Reduction.— A striking feature in the pronunciation of longer words is
the strong tendency to reduce unstressed vowels to [a] and its variants, or even to
zero. Here follow some examples (optimal and reduced forms are given in this
order): /sta'uaqin/ [sto'yaqeyi, sto'yaeqen, sto'uaqan, -qg] 'graveyard', /ma'lalus/
[mA'lalos, mA'lalas] 'raccoon', /?u'x 0 umix°/ [?o-'x°omex°, ?o -l x°umux 0 ] 'village'; a
particular type of reduction in /aft?)/, e.g. /X'VX'iX""^ [Ve- 'X»e*°ai, X l e ,| reX 0 ei, -X°e]
'brook trout', /sli1 *°ai?§n/ [sis''i c ai?§ij, sic'Xcoi?sn] 'foot of mountain', where /aj(?)/
tends to merge with /i(?)/. In the neighborhood of uvulars, reduced vowels tend to
be more open, and particularly /i/ is often reduced to [e] in this position (cf. /sta'yaqin/
quoted above); the same goes for /i(?)/ as a reduction of /aj(?)/, e.g. /si'uai?q/
[se- 'yai?q, se- 'ye?q] 'pants'. The unstressed suffixes /-yiX, -yas/ reduce to /-vik, -us/,
36                                       PHONOLOGYe.g. /5a'?tuity [5a'?tuek, -uiX, - o l ] 'build a canoe', /nq>0i 'q>0lxjas/ [naq'V 'q>0Juaes, -os]
'stick for holding salmon above the fire'.
   This tendency to reduce unstressed vowels has had phonemic consequences: many
words contain affixes in reduced form even in the most careful pronunciation, so that
alternative forms of the affix must be recognized: /-qin, -qn/, /-mix°, -max0/, ¡-uik, -vX/,
etc. As an example may serve the suffix /-qin, -qn/ 'head; hair; throat; language'
which occurs stressed in /ns-qi'n-m/ [nsqe'jnip] 'rub oil /ns-/ in one's hair', and
unstressed in reduced form in /s-na's-qn/ [snA'sqjj] 'hair-oil', in non-reduced form in
/6>ix°-i'-qin/ [S>ex°e' 'qeyi] 'be thirsty', lit. 'have a dry /C'ix0-/ throat' (of course, the
latter word allows also reduced forms with [-qen,             in the same way as the example
/sta'uaqin/ quoted above, but /sna'sqn/ does not allow a form with [-qejn] — it is
as if, in English, both ""forehead"" and ""bulkhead"" had a form with [-id], which only
in the latter case allowed a fuller pronunciation with [-hed]).","[35, 36]"
"255. The trans, finite forms which lack a subject-suffix, i.e. those with 1st or 2nd pers.
subject (see 131) are identical with the subject-centered forms of the nominal
paradigm (see 130) except for the clitics, e.g. /ô-x° w 5'a , yat-c/ 'you help me' and
/na^C'a'uat-c/ '(one) who helps me'; obviously, these finite forms can be interpreted
as nominal: 'you are (one) who helps me'. The object-centered trans, nominal form
/na w ta'q°an-t-as/ 'which he drank' differs from the subject-centered one /na w ta'q°an/
'who drank it' (see 130) in that it has the subject-suffix /-as/, before which the trans,
suffix /-an/ is extended with /-t-/ (see 82). If we translate /na w ta'q°an/ as 'which is
characterized by transitive drinking', then /na^ta'q°antas/ can be analyzed as going
back to */na N ^ta'q°an t-?as/ 'which is characterized by trans, drinking by /t-/ him
/Pas/' (relative case prefix + 3rd pers. clitic). This is the type of construction
commonly referred to as ""ergative"", cf. English ""he (nom.) is a standee"" and ""he
(nom.) is his (obi.) advisee"". Though this construction must have existed at least in
3rd pers. forms with a pronominal subject, it is no longer a feature of Squamish: a
finite form like /na w ô > a'uat-c-as/ 'he helps me', as compared to the nominal form
/na^ô'a'uat-c/ '(one) who helps me' does not allow an ergative interpretation (nor
can it be described as nominal). The ergative survives only in the 3rd pers. object-
centered nominal forms of trans, verbs, necessitating the use of the phrase 'subject of
itr. or object of tr. verb' in the description of phrases with adjuncts (see 259, 260 ;
cf. also 273).

"125. Subject-suffixes.— The subject-suffix for the 2nd pers. plur. /-aiap/ is usually
shortened to /-ap/, even under a stress.
   In unstressed position, all subject-suffixes except that for 2nd pers. plur. often
appear in reduced form, with /a/ instead of /a/; the form without /a/ is the only one
used in unstressed combinations with the clitic /£-/ (see next paragraph).
   The subject-suffixes for 1st and 2nd person are often combined not with the full
stem itself but with the clitic /5-/ 'to be, to act as'; in unstressed position these
combinations contain the suffix in reduced form: /5-n, 5-x°, £-t, 5-ap/ (for the tran-
scription without /a/ see 52). For instance, the 1st pers. sing, suffix /-(a)n/ is attached
to the full stem in /?i'tut-an/ 'my (hypothetical) sleeping' buttothecliticin/5-n w ?i l tut/
'I sleep'. These combinations of clitic + subject-suffix have to a certain extent
achieved the status of mere pronominal elements, cf. the 1st pers. plur. possessive
suffix /-Cat/ 'our' (see 127), where any reference to an action or process is absent.
   The 1st pers. subject-suffixes /-an, -at/ are not combined with 2nd pers. object-
suffixes in the same word (for the expression of 'I ... thee', etc., the language has
recourse to clitics or to possessive affixes, see below). A number of forms referring
to a 3rd pers. subject lack the 3rd pers. subject-suffix /-as/ (for details see below);
the plural suffix /-uit/ appears in forms both with and without /-as/.",[86]
"                                   Suffixed    Numerals217. Numerals occur with certain lexical suffixes. Some of the latter were recorded
with numerals only; these are indicated with ""num. only"" in the list below. Two
types of combinations of numeral + suffix may be distinguished. In the first, the
152                                    MORPHOLOGY
suffix simply refers to the object(s) counted; in the second, the suffix refers to the
class of the objects counted, and the name of the object is added to the suffixed
numeral. Combinations of the first type were recorded with the suffixes /-ay?tx°/
'house' and /-auanax0/ 'year'. Here follows a list of all suffixes recorded with
numerals (including the numerical interrogative):

specifying (S, O) and qualifying (R) the predicate; these need not all be present. The
order 2-5 is not obligatory, but by far the most usual. The trans, verb — passivized
or not — implies an extra referent (O or Rx) in comparison to the intransitive.
S and O are in the absolutive, R1; R a in the relative case. The initiator of the action
precedes the goal: S-O or Ri-S.
                                           XXII                                   THE PREDICATE
249. A predicate may occur by itself, without explicit nominal references to subject,
object and other relata. If the predicate-word is a noun or intransitive verb, it
implies a reference to a subject only. If the subject is 1st or 2nd person, this reference
is made by a subject-suffix attached to the clitic /5-/> regardless of whether the predicate-
word is a noun or verb. The clitic may precede or follow the predicate-word; in the
latter case it occasionally has a stress of its own, especially when the predicate-word
is monosyllabic. If the subject is 3rd person, there is no explicit reference to it, but
the predicate is often ""concretized"" by the clitic /na/ 'there, then'. This clitic always
precedes the predicate-word. Examples of intrans, predicates: /5-nwc>ic>alp>/ or
/c'icVp^ò-n/ 'I work', /(naw)c'ic>alp>/ 'he works'; /5-n w ha'?ty or /ha'?X_5-n,
ha'?XwC-aln/ 'I am good', /(na_)ha'?ty 'he is good', 'it is good'; /fi-n^sui'Pqa/ or
/syi'Pqa w 5-n/ 'I am a man', /sui'Pqa/ 'he (it) is a man'; /6-x0wn-sia'i?/ or /?n-sia'i?_
5-x°/ 'you are my /(?)n-/ friend', /Pn-sja'i?/ 'he (it) is my friend'; /toq >0 / 'it's dark',
/Xa'XmPx0/ 'it's rainy', /k>0in/ 'they (things) are few', 'there are few (things)',
/nawn-s.malk>°m/ 'I found (rather than bought, received, made) it', lit. 'it is my /n-/
find /s-m3lk>0-m/'. Note the expressions /6-x°^X>i'q/ 'hello!' (said to a person
arriving), lit. 'you arrive'; /6-x°whi4a1?/ 'goodbye!' (said to a person leaving), lit.
'you depart'; /hu'i w 5-x° w ?a/ 'thank you!', lit. 'you are ready /hu[/', with the
emphatic clitic /Pa/ (see 236).
   If an attribute-plus-noun phrase is used predicatively, the clitic follows the
attribute, e.g. /ha'PX. sui'Pqa/ '(he is a) good man', /ha'PX^fi-x0 sui'Pqa/ 'you are a
good man'.","[170, 171]"
"261. In the second place, an appositive adjunct may be represented by a noun
naming the possessor in a possessive construction. These constructions are of two
kinds. When the possessor is referred to by a proper name or by a personal substitute,
the head is without possessive suffix and the adjunct is in the relative case:
/k°3ci w la l m? r a ^ T a ' m / 'Tom's house', /k°aci^ma^n Va_Qa l lqaliX/ 'Q.'s lice'
(1:30), /ta w sma'nit X. > a w St > a l ?mss/ 'the mountain of Stamis* (111:7), /sya't
X'a^na'ij-iap/ 'which one of you?', / n a _ n a ' ? tk°a w ,?a l iaXq°.mi l n? X'a^ni'maty
'he is down below us', lit. 'he is at the (invisible) lower side of us' (alternative /na w n a ' P
tk°a^?a l j|aXq 0 .mi l n?-63t/ ' . . . a t our lower side'). When the possessor is not referred
to by a proper name or pers. substitute, the adjunct is in the absolutive case, and the
head has the 3rd pers. possessive suffix /-s/: /ta^la'mP-s ta^siPa'm?/ 'the house
of the chief', /k°3Xi w ma l n?-s k ^ i ^ s i P a ' m ? / 'the daughter of the chief', /ha'PX
t a w s u ' m ? - s t a ^ s p a ' q ' a m / 'the flower smells good', lit. 'good (is) the smell of the
flower', /ta w sq > 0 u'i-s kVci/ 'that (absent) one's disease'. A possessive phrase may
occur as an appositive adjunct; the head of the possessive construction has the
same referent as the head of the whole expression:                         sXa 'nai? ma 'n?-s k°aci w
siPa'm?/ 'the girl, a daughter of the chief' (111:47).

sentence, and the subject or object of which does not have the same referent as the
head to which it is an adjunct. Instead, some other element of the adjunct has the
same referent as the head of the construction; according to the nature of this element
we distinguish possessive, relative and predicative independent adjuncts.","[176, 177]"
"267. The subject lacks an article precisely in those cases where the predicate refers to
the individual as such, either with an article, e.g. /ta^?as(h)ii' nsX'i'P/ 'I want the
big one', or with a deictic stem, e.g. /na'u n-sja'j?/ 'you are my friend', /ni'X ta'i?
n-sja'j?/ 'that one is my friend' (versus /ha'?X ta^n-sia'j?/ 'my friend is good'). Note
the alternative expressions / k ° i ^ s t a ' m ua w tx°ta'tanitaiap/ or /sta'm k ° a ^ u a _
tx°ta'tanitajap/ 'what are you pi. discussing?'.
    An article may be lacking in the subject of a sentence with /ci?/ 'there is' (see 257)
if this subject contains a possessive affix: /ci'? ( t i w , k°3ci w )nTla'm?/ 'I have a house'.
The same goes for sentences with quantitative predicates: /Pa'nPus n-sn3x°i'X/ 'I have
two canoes', /PnPa'nPus n-sqa'?q/ 'I have two (younger) siblings', /tx°(h)u'j
na^Pi'p'istan/ 'it's all I've left', / q a ' i n-sc'ic'a'p'/ 'I have much work'; here, too, an
article is possible, e.g. /qa'X ta w n-sq > 0 u'j.n3x7 'I've caught a lot', lit. 'many (are) my
killed ones'.
    Numerical expressions lack an article when mere counting is involved, e.g.
/£-nv_^q>cu'i.n3x° Pa'nPus mi'XaX/ 'I have killed two bears'. When a number is
specified independently (and not merely given as the result of a count), an indefinite
article must be used. Example: /pa-srmn^ta'pstax 0 k°i w Xa?u'cn-qs/ 'then you
(must) make four pieces' (111:26). When an individual counted group (rather than
a mere number of objects belonging to a class) is referred to, a definite article or
demonstrative is used: /k°3'ci*uit Sniia'nat siuPi'Pqa/ 'the (those) three men' (11:2),
/ni'X Ps-srmn w ci 1 qin?tax° t-ta w ?a'n?us-qs Ca'mX/ 'then you (must) spear it with
the two pieces of pitch' (111:29). Note the different word-order in /C-n^Xa'lPt
ta v _qa l X sni'Cim/ 'I write down many words' as against / n a ^ t u ' j n t m Pi'?X°aX0
t-k°a^sq > 3q > °u'?-s/ 'he was left by all his companions'.
    An article is lacking in the relatum of the passivized causative verb /syo'Pu-s-t-m/
'be called', lit. 'be caused to be one who is called': / u a ' P ^ t sua'Pustm Pi'ta/ 'he used

Peter', see 270).
  An article is also lacking in certain nominalized verb-forms after predicates
referring to location, see 317.","[178, 179]"
"253. When subject, object, etc., are made explicit by nominal expressions, these
follow the predicate in the manner described in 245-248. To the possible sentence-
types summed up there, there exists the following restriction: a combination of a
3rd pers. trans, verb with a noun in the absolutive case (VtNa), when produced in
isolation, represents VtO and not VtS. For example, /na^C'a'mPt-as ta^sq°ma'i?/
is understood as 'he bit the dog' and not as """"the dog bit him', even though
/na w/ £ > a'm?tas/ by itself means 'he bit him' and S and O are both in the absolutive
case. In isolation, 'the dog bit him' is rendered by a passive construction VpR^
/na^CVmPt-m t-ta w sq°ma'i?/, lit. 'he was bitten by the dog' (cf. the sentence VPS
/na^S'a'mPt-m ta w sq°ma'i?/ 'the dog was bitten').
                                      THE PREDICATE                                      173
254. The abovementioned peculiarity of isolated sentences VtN a , and also some other
features of Squamish syntax, can be explained on the basis of certain reflections on
the Squamish transitive predicate in general, for which purpose we introduce — in
this section only — the terms thème (what one speaks about) and propos (what one
says about it). The 3rd pers. finite form /na^ëVmPt-as/ 'he bit him' is identical
with the nominal form '(one) whom he bit' (see 134), so that it can be interpreted
as a nominal predicate '(it is) what he bit', cf. /sui'Pqa/ '(it is) a man'. Where S and
O are specified, e.g. in VtSO /na^ôVmPt-as ta w sq°ma'i? ta^sui'Pa/ 'the dog bit
the man', the phrase VtS is the propos '(it is) what it, the dog, bit', and O 'the man' is
the thème to this propos, so that the whole sentence can be rendered '(it is) what the
dog bit, the man' = 'the man is what (or: whom) the dog bit'. In this conception of
the Squamish VtSO sentence the fact that S and O are both in the absolutive case
finds a satisfactory explanation: both are ""subjects"" to a ""predicate"". Furthermore,
if /na^ô'a'mPtas ta w sq°ma l j[?/ is interpreted as 'he bit the dog' ( = 'it is what he bit,
the dog') and not as 'the dog bit him' ( = 'it is what it, the dog, bit'), then this is
because such an isolated sentence is taken as a complete whole thème-propos (VtO)
and not as a mere propos (VtS). In the same way, the English sentence ""he was
helping the boy"", produced in isolation with a strong stress on ""helping"", will be
taken as an instance of the construction SVO, though the same intonation-pattern
can also be used for ""he was helping (us, them), the boy"".","[172, 173]"
"3. Juncture.— In those cases where two types of juncture are opposed to each other,
the symbol /./ is employed to indicate the less frequent type. The cases in question
are (a) syllabic vs. non-syllabic /./ contact between consonants, see 8, 39, 48, 52;
(b) close vs. open /./ contact between consonants, see 46, or between a sonant and a
following /?/, see 28, 40. Reading rule: to /C.C/ there corresponds phonetically
[CC], i.e. consonants are pronounced without intervening [a] and without coalescing.

                                      A. CONSONANTS4. Place of Articulation.— The labials are bilabial. The dental closure is formed with
the tongue-tip against the back of the front teeth, but with a larger area of the tongue
touching the alveoles than is the case, for instance, in French, so that /n/ sounds
slightly more palatal than French /n/, though it is closer to the latter than to French
/fi/. The palatals are closer to Russian ""soft"" /5/ than to ""hard"" /§, 2/. The laterals
are bilateral; in /X, X'l the tongue is released approximately from the second molars
on, and their acoustic effect is closer to ""tl"" than to ""kl"". The sonant /I/ is in between
the ""mid"" variety (as in Dutch) and the velarized type (as in English); it is most
strongly velar after a vowel before cons, or at the end of a word, and least so in
word-initial position. Of the velars, /k, k5/ are slightly more front than /k°, k >0 , x°/;
they are articulated at the same place as English /k/ in ""cat"", while the labialized
velars are farther back than Engl, /k/ in ""cool"". The uvulars are quite close to the
labialized velars, so that /q°, q >0 , i°/ are hard to distinguish from /k°, k >0 , x°/, though
