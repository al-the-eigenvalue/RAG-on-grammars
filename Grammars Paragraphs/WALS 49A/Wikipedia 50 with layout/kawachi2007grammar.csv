"5.1.1.1 Case Marking       As mentioned earlier, Sidaama is a nominative-accusative language. Subjects arein the nominative case, direct objects are in the accusative case, and indirect objects arein the dative case. The following discussion shows how the grammatical relations arecoded by case marking on the heads of NPs (nouns or pronouns) (Chapter 3 section3.2.1.1, Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.1.3) and adnominal constituents (attributive adjectives oradnominal demonstratives) (Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.5, Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.2.1).",[503]

4.2.2.1.3 Case Affixes on Nouns            Sidaama is a nominative-accusative language. Case can be morphologicallymarked by suprafixation (Chapter 2 section 2.3.2), suffixation, or both. The nominative,dative-locative, allative, and ablative-instrumental cases are marked with suffixes, theaccusative and oblique cases are marked with suprafixes, and the genitive case is markedboth with a suffix and a suprafix. The following discussion deals only with case affixeson nouns; see Chapter 3 (section 3.2.1.4) for case affixes on demonstrative pronouns.","[372, 373]"

       When the head of an NP is a pronoun, the same relationship applies: subjects arein the nominative case, direct objects are in the accusative case, and indirect objects arein the dative case. Independent personal pronouns take the forms in Table 5.2 dependingon their case (Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.1). Although many of their nominative andaccusative forms look identical, they differ in their pitch accent patterns — high pitchfalls on the penultimate vowel segments of the nominative forms, and on the final vowelsof the accusative forms. The dative forms of the personal pronouns are formed by addingthe dative suffix -ra to the genitive forms.","[505, 506]"

  Table 5.2: Nominative, Accusative, and Dative Case Forms of the Personal Pronouns
       Two sets of demonstrative pronouns (and their reduplicated forms) have the formsin Table 5.3. Like modified masculine common nouns and /a/-ending masculine propernouns, their nominative forms end in the nominative case suffix -i (Tables 3.5 and 3.7 inChapter 3 section 3.2.1.4). Their accusative forms are marked with the suprafix, whichoccurs as high pitch on their final vowel segments.",[506]
"3.2.1.1 Personal Pronouns       The personal pronouns in Sidaama are listed in Table 3.4.                   Unlike thegrammatical cases on nouns, which can be morphologically marked, the grammaticalcases of pronouns are distinguished by their different forms. Many of the personalpronouns for different cases may look identical in form, but as mentioned in Chapter 2(section 2.3.2), different pitch accent patterns also distinguish the nominative case andothers on pronouns (as well as nouns) — high pitch occurs on the penultimate vowelsegments of the nominative forms and on the final vowels of the other forms.",[201]

        An example with masculine nouns in the nominative, accusative, and dative casesis shown in (5.1), where hanaat’icca, wot’e, and hakimic c  a are in the nominative,accusative, and dative, and the subject, direct object, and indirect object, respectively.(5.1)   hanaat’icc-u           wot’e     hakimicca-ho
        carpenter-NOM.M          money(ACC) doctor.M-DAT.M        u-ø-i.
        give-3SG.M-S.PRF.3SG.M        ‘The carpenter (M) gave money to the doctor (M).’
        (pitch accent pattern: hanaat’icc-u wot’e hakimicca-ho u-i.)
        As discussed in Chapter 4 (section 4.2.2.1.3), the allomorphs of the genitive suffixfor masculine nouns are the same as those of the nominative case suffix for masculinenouns, -u and -i, and the two allomorphs of the genitive case suffix and those of thenominative case suffix occur in exactly the same set of conditions (Table 5.1; Tables 4.1and 4.2 in Chapter 4). The locative suffix on both feminine and masculine nouns also hasthe same forms as the dative case suffix, -te, -ho, and -ra, and these forms also occur inalmost the same set of environments (Table 5.1; Table 4.3 in Chapter 4) (the onlydifference is that masculine and feminine proper nouns take -te and -ho, respectively, asthe locative case suffix, while both take -ra as the dative case suffix). Furthermore, thegenitive suffix on unmodified feminine common nouns has the same form as the dativesuffix on unmodified feminine common nouns, -te. Therefore, the grammatical relationscan be indicated by case marking, but the case and grammatical relation of an NPsometimes cannot be precisely identified by the forms of the head noun alone.","[504, 505]"
"        Oblique arguments are either marked with case suffixes (specifically, the locative,allative, or ablative-instrumental suffix; Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.1.3.6) or a suprafix (highpitch on the final vowel segment). The latter type of oblique NP is headed by one of thelocational nouns (Chapter 3 section 3.1.1.3) or by the noun-phrase clitic =wa (Chapter 3section 3.2.2.2), or is used in one type of external possessor construction, the obliquepossessum external possessor construction (section 5.3).1
1
  The oblique with the suprafix could be grouped with the accusative under a single case called the
“absolute” case (as is often done in the literature on Highland East Cushitic languages; e.g., Hudson 1976),
because the head noun of an oblique NP and that of an accusative NP are marked with high pitch on the
final vowel segment. However, the present study distinguishes the two, because unlike accusative NPs,
morphologically unmarked oblique NPs are always constituents not required by the valency of the verb.",[504]
"         Attributive adjectives and adnominal demonstratives are also case-marked. InNPs whose heads are modified by these adnominal constituents, the grammaticalrelations are indicated by the cases on the adnominal constituents as well as the headnouns. An adjective that modifies the masculine head noun of the subject NP agrees incase with that noun, and takes the nominative case suffix -u. An adjective that modifiesan accusative noun also agrees in case with the head noun, and both the noun and theadjective will have the accusative suprafix, which is realized as high pitch on the finalvowel segment. An adjective that modifies a genitive noun also agrees in case with thehead noun, and is in the genitive case; thus, when a genitive noun is followed by thedative case suffix -ra, an adjective that modifies it is also in the genitive. This alsoapplies to adnominal demonstratives, which can take different forms depending on thecase of the head noun (Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.5). See (5.2), where the cases of the                                                 - 486 -

                  to mean, ‘She is that tall man’s sister.’          It should be noted that the use of adjectives like nouns is different from the use ofadjectives as nouns. In Sidaama, the noun modified by an adjective can sometimes beomitted.33 In this case, the adjective modifying the omitted noun looks as if it wereserving as an argument. This happens when the referent of the omitted noun isunderstood by the conversation participants to be a particular entity. It also happenswhen the referent is compared to another entity that belongs to the category of theomitted noun that has a property different from the one expressed by the adjective. For
33
   Dryer (2004) points out that there are two types of cases where noun phrases without nouns (or
pronouns) (i.e., those consisting of elements that would otherwise be optional modifiers of “head” nouns)
are likely to be used: (i) “when the speaker does not know what kind of thing the thing that they are
referring to is” and (ii) “when the kind will be so obvious to the hearer that it can be left out” (p.70). Dryer
argues that in the case of (i), nouns do not have a privileged status in noun phrases, and proposes that all
noun phrases are headless; he questions the ‘head’ of an NP as a universal notion. On the other hand,
according to him, in the case of (ii), ellipsis of the noun is likely to be involved.
          The use of noun phrases in Sidaama that do not contain nouns, as in (3.145) and (3.146), is an
example of the latter case. Such noun phrases in Sidaama can occur only when the hearer knows what the
ellipsed noun is.","[175, 176]"

When the masculine noun is in the accusative and is thus marked with the zero suffix andthe suprafix, the adjective that modifies it is also marked with the zero suffix and thesuprafix (e.g., duumo ‘red’ in (4.155)). When the masculine noun is marked with a casesuffix other than for the nominative/genitive cases (for example, the dative case suffix)and is modified with an adjective, that case suffix is added to the genitive stem of thenoun, and the attributive adjective has to be in the genitive case (e.g., but’icc- u [poor-GEN.M] ‘poor’ and danc-u [good-GEN.M] ‘good’ in (4.155)).","[408, 409, 410]"

2.3.4 Pause       Sidaama often uses pauses to indicate constituent boundaries. When the sentencehas SOV word order, a pause usually occurs between the constituent boundaries (Teferra2000: 16-17), as in (2.73). (In the examples in this section, pauses are indicated with //.)
(2.73) bule         //     danura                  //      sunk’-i-t-u.
       Bule(NOM.F) //       Dangura(ACC)              //      kiss-EP-3SG.F-S.PRF.3SG.F
       ‘Bule kissed Dangura.’In a sentence of OSV order such as (2.74), a long pause can generally occur after the firstconstituent.
(2.74) danura             //        bule                   sunk’-i-t-u.
       Dangura(ACC)         //        Bule(NOM.F)             kiss-EP-3SG.F-S.PRF.3SG.F
       ‘Bule kissed Dangura.’The constituent structure of a transcribed sentence can differ depending on the location ofa pause, especially because some case forms are morphologically identical (specifically,the nominative and the accusative of a feminine noun, the genitive and dative/locative ofan unmodified feminine common noun, and the genitive and nominative of a masculinenoun) and the person/number/gender of the subject can be indicated by the verb suffixalone, rather than the subject being expressed as independent nouns or pronouns. Forexample, each pair of sentences in (2.75) and (2.76), which look morphologicallyidentical, differ in the locations where pauses as well as high pitch accents are placed.","[95, 96]"
"For example, the order in (5.102a) is preferred over that in (5.102b).(5.102) (a)      ai              macc’a       lowo=ho ?

5.3 External Possessor Constructions       Sidaama has two types of external possessor constructions (EPCs). Examples areshown in (5.103a) and (5.103b). In one type exemplified by (5.103a), the possessumnoun is in the oblique case; the possessor, which is in the nominative case in thisexample, is not in the same NP as the possessum. In the other type illustrated in(5.103b), the possessor is in the dative case, and likewise does not form a constituent withthe possessum.(5.103) (a)      hakku      manc-i                              hat’o

                 respect to the back of the neck.’)
                                             - 531 -

                 tired to that man.’)
In contrast, possession is internally expressed within an NP in (5.103c). In this example,the possessor NP hakko manc-i [that.M.GEN person-GEN.MOD.M], which is in thegenitive case, modifies the possessum noun hat’o [nape(NOM.F)] within the NP hakkomanc-i hat’o.

                 become.tired-3SG.F-S.PRF.3SG.F                 ‘The back of that man’s neck got tired.’
       As shown in (5.103a) and (5.103b), in EPCs, the possessor is expressed in aconstituent external to the possessum NP (e.g., Chappell and McGregor 1996, Payne andBarshi 1999). Typically, the possessor is an extra participant, which is not required bythe valency of the verb but is still expressed as a core argument. Crosslinguistically themost common construction types of EPCs are double accusatives (e.g., Bally1996[1926]), applicatives (e.g., Blake 1984), possessum noun incorporations (e.g.,Mithun 1996), and dative possessor constructions (e.g., Bally 1996[1926], König and

              ‘I washed his face.’ (lit., ‘I facewashed him.’)dative possessor constructions:
e.g., German (König and Haspelmath 1998: 526, Haspelmath 1999: 109)
(5.107)        Die    Mutter wusch         dem         Kind die                                     Haare.

               ‘The mother washed the child’s hair.’
Body-part locative constructions with the possessum NP “demoted” to part of a PP (e.g.,English: pinch him in the belly) are sometimes also included among EPCs (e.g., Fox1981).","[552, 553, 554]"
"          When an adjective modifies a masculine noun, the adjective is marked with thenominative/genitive case suffix -u if the noun that it modifies is in the nominative orgenitive case. For example, in (4.148) and (4.149), seeda ‘tall’, which modifies manc-i‘person’ (in the nominative in (4.148) and in the genitive in (4.149)), is marked with thenominative suffix and the genitive suffix, respectively. The nominative and genitive casesuffixes on an adjective have the same forms regardless of whether or not the adjective ismodified by an adverbial like lowo eessa ‘very much’.

Feminine vs. Masculine Nouns, (iii) Countable vs. Uncountable Nouns, and (iv)Inherently vs. Optionally Possessed Nouns.(i) Common vs. Proper Nouns         One way in which nouns can be classified into subtypes is whether they arecommon nouns or proper nouns. Basically, a common noun can be modified by an NP (acommon or proper noun, a personal pronoun, an interrogative pronoun, etc.) in thegenitive case or an adnominal (an adnominal demonstrative, an adjective including aquantifier, an interrogative adjective, etc., a numeral, or a relative clause), each of whichhas to precede the common noun. It is also possible to attach the possessive pronominalsuffix to a common noun, and this is the only dependent that can occur after a noun. Onthe other hand, a proper noun, which refers to a specific entity or a specific group ofentities, cannot be modified by another form.2
2
 The modification of a proper noun with a numeral or an adjective as in (i) (B’s utterance) and (ii) is only
acceptable in contexts like these, where the speaker and the addressee cannot identify the referent from the
proper noun alone (Thomas Payne 1997: 39).(i)      A:       ki’ne             oll-i-ra                                    damboowa

(ii) Feminine vs. Masculine Nouns        In some morphosyntactic environments, any noun is treated as having gender,either feminine or masculine, regardless of whether the noun is a common or propernoun. As discussed shortly, the distinction between the two categories of nounsmanifests itself in a difference in their morphological marking patterns of cases and intheir agreement with the inflectional verb suffixes (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.3) and thepredicative noun-phrase clitic (section 3.2.2.1).","[99, 100, 101]"

Each of them isusually followed by one of the three suffixes — AT: -nni, TO: -ra, and FROM: -nni, asshown in Table 3.7. Like most of the locational nouns in section 3.1.1.3, thedemonstrative pronouns are marked with the genitive case suffix -i when followed by thesuffix for TO or FROM.","[211, 212]"
"               •    There are lexical similarities among the HEC languages.11
10
   Hudson (1976: 258) reports that unlike Burji, Gedeo, and Hadiyya, which have an independent genitive
pronoun, Sidaama and Kambata have a “genitive” (possessive) pronominal suffix and the use of an
independent genitive pronoun is uncommon in these two languages. However, this does not apply to the
dialect of Sidaama investigated by the present study at least. The genitive pronoun and the possessive
pronominal suffix are interchangeable in many cases, though the use of the genitive pronoun can be
emphatic in some cases; there are even cases where only the genitive pronoun can be used and the
possessive pronominal suffix cannot (Chapter 5 section 5.4.3).",[30]
"3.1.3.1 Similarities and Differences between Adjectives and Nouns          Adjectives can normally be used either predicatively or attributively. Thepredicating noun-phrase clitic that follows a predicative adjective agrees in gender withthe subject noun (=te for a feminine subject and =ho for a masculine subject), and anattributive adjective agrees in gender and case with the noun that it modifies. In (3.107)and (3.108), the adjective seeda ‘tall’, which is followed by the predicating noun-phraseclitic, is a predicate, and in (3.109) and (3.110), the nominative form of the sameadjective modifies the subject noun, which is in the nominative case.

               ‘The tall boy left.’However, the property of having the two uses is not limited to adjectives; nouns can alsobe used either as parts of predicates or as modifiers of other nouns. When nouns are usedpredicatively and are not modified by any morpheme, they behave the same way asadjectives; they are followed by the predicating noun-phrase clitic =te/=ho, which agreesin gender with the subject noun.

Similarly, when nouns in the genitive modify other nouns, theformer come before the latter, as in (3.117). Furthermore, both adjectives and nouns canbe marked with case (in (3.110) and (3.117b), the suffixes on the subject nouns have thesame form: seed-u and manc-u, respectively). However, the bases on which they arecase-marked are somewhat different. The case of an attributive adjective is determinedby the case of the noun that it modifies — for example, if the modified noun is in thenominative case, the attributive adjective that modifies it is also in the nominative, as in(3.109) and (3.110). On the other hand, the case of a noun that modifies another noun isgenitive, as in (3.117).","[159, 160, 161]"

"In (3.342)-(3.344), =ta/=ha/=re follow relative clauses. The noun-phrase clitic has to bethe subject, direct object, or indirect object of the relative clause.62 In (3.342), =ha is inthe accusative, in (3.343), =ta is in the genitive case and is followed by the dative suffix-ra, and in (3.344), =re is in the nominative case.

   As discussed in Chapter 5 (section 5.1.1.2), the nominative singular masculine form of this clitic, =hu,
can be used in the construction, “REL.CL=hu ...=ti”, whose subject is the head of a relative clause ending
in =hu and whose predicate ends in the predicating clitic =ti. In this use, the noun-phrase clitic can be
either the direct or indirect object or a non-argument of the relative clause, but cannot be its subject.",[266]

   Nevertheless, this analysis is based solely on my consultant’s intuition, rather than any grammatical
evidence. The oblique case has the same form as the accusative case, and there is no evidence that a
construction like (5.150) is not the Dative EPC; in other words, there is no evidence that k’ubbicco ‘finger’
is not in the accusative case.",[586]

5.1.1.2) that refers to an animate possessor. The pronominal object suffix is used usuallyfor a primary object or a beneficiary, and cannot be used for the possessor of the IPC, asin (5.109c). This shows that, in (5.109a) and (5.109b), wosinco ‘guest’ is a dependent ofthe verb and is not a dependent of the possessum lekka ‘foot’. Third, unlike the IPC,which prohibits an adverbial from intervening between the possessor NP and thepossessum NP, as shown in (5.109a’) and (5.109b’), both the Dative EPC and theOblique EPC allow the occurrence of an adverbial in this position.(5.109’) (a)   beett-u               wosinco       bero            lekka

Moreover, unlike in the IPC, in the Dative EPC and the Oblique EPC, the order of theconstituents other than the verb is relatively flexible, though the possessor NP normallyhas to precede the possessum NP. Thus, the agent NP cannot occur between thepossessor NP and the possessum NP in the IPC example (5.109c’’), whereas it can in theDative EPC example (5.109b’’) and the Oblique EPC example (5.109a’’).(5.109’’) (a) wosinco       beett-u             lekka         haiss-ø-ino.

                to mean, ‘The boy washed the guest’s (M) feet.’17
Finally, in the Dative EPC, the possessum noun can be marked with the possessivepronominal suffix that refers to an animate possessor, even when the possessor NP occurselsewhere, as in (5.109b’’’). In the Oblique EPC, the use of the possessive pronominalsuffix in addition to the expression of an animate possessor with a full noun or pronoun issometimes judged as redundant, though it is not ungrammatical, as in (5.109a’’’). Onthe other hand, in the IPC, the possessum noun can never be marked with the possessivepronominal suffix that refers to an animate possessor when the possessor NP is alreadyexpressed with a full noun or pronoun in the genitive case, as in (5.109c’’’). The head of

For these reasons, the possessor NP is external to the possessum NP in both the ObliqueEPC and the Dative EPC. This applies not only to the two types of EPCs with atransitive verb predicate like (5.109)-(5.109’’’), but also to the two types of EPCs withother types of predicates (an intransitive verb and an adjective).","[557, 558, 559, 560, 561]"

Chapters 2-5 usebasic linguistic theory (Dixon 1997, Dryer 2006) to describe the phonology andmorphosyntax of Sidaama, and Chapter 6 examines the event integration patterns (Talmy1991, 2000b) as one property of semantic structuring in this language.","[19, 20, 21, 22]"

Third, this suffix also attaches to an Unmodified common noun for an object (rather thana location) and is followed by the noun-phrase clitic =wa ‘place’.23 The phrase mayexpress a location, as in (4.146), or a goal, as in (4.147).(4.146)         lat’o                 buus-u-nni=wa                  no.

   However, the meaning of this suffix is not clear when the Unmodified common noun preceding it is
feminine, though it seems to indicate that the noun has a specific referent. For example, (ia) is

However, even when the genitive pronoun is the only modifier of the head noun thatcomes right after the relative clause, the noun-phrase clitic is still required, as in (5.74).13

   Nevertheless, this does not apply when the head noun is the indirect object of the main clause, as in (i).
In such a case, the noun-phrase clitic is optional.","[538, 539]"
"In (4.288), the plural suffix -ulle precedes the nominative case suffix -u, and in (4.289),the singular suffix -co precedes the genitive case suffix -i and the dative case suffix -ra.

   When its order is arbitrary, gender is presented in the order in accordance with the following rules: (i)
for words such as women and men and female and male, the odd-numbered chapters follow the feminine-
masculine order, and the even-numbered chapters the opposite order; (ii) “s/he” is used as a gender-neutral,
singular pronoun in the nominative case, and “his/her” and “him/her” are used as gender-neutral, singular
pronouns in the genitive case and accusative case, respectively. Because the consultant and the author are
both male, most examples that contain the first-person and second-person singular pronouns are those for
masculine referents.","[36, 37]"

When the words in (3.130a) and (3.130b) are modified by adjectives or demonstratives,they follow the case marking pattern of nouns. As in (3.137), when they are masculinenouns and in the nominative case, the nominative suffix to be used is -i (as already seenin (3.131), when they are used as adjectives and modify nouns in the nominative caseattributively, the nominative suffix on them is -u).","[173, 174, 175]"
"       Schachter (1985: 7) lists case, number, class or gender, and definiteness as typicalcategories associated with nouns. In Sidaama, case is marked with affixes on nouns, andnumber and gender may be so marked, which is discussed below and in the next chapter(Chapter 4 section 4.2.1). However, Sidaama nouns usually do not make a definitenessdistinction morphologically (except that as seen later in Chapter 4 (section 4.2.2.1.5), the

suffix -nni can express the definiteness of the referent of a common noun used for thegoal of motion and for possession). For example, the referent of any of the NPs in (3.1)and (3.2), can be interpreted as either definite or indefinite.1

"3.2.1.3 Reciprocal Pronoun          The Sidaama reciprocal pronoun mimmito ‘each other’, which is the reduplicatedform of the numeral mitto ‘one (M)’, is used for the action of more than one participant(typically, two participants) on one another.

masculine noun has a feminine plural counterpart, and there seems to be no noun whoseunmarked or singular form is feminine and whose plural form is masculine.9(iv) Inherently vs. Optionally Possessed Nouns        In Sidaama, some nouns cannot occur by themselves and have to be accompaniedby a noun (in the genitive) or a pronominal (the genitive personal pronoun or thepossessive pronominal suffix), which refers to the possessor of their referent. (3.34) and(3.35) show that iddo ‘inner part’ and lekka ‘leg’ are such nouns.10

  The reversal of gender between the singular and plural forms of a noun is noted by Hudson (1976: 252)
(also, Teferra 2000: 41), but there are many counterexamples (including ‘iron’, ‘rock, stone’, and
‘elephant’).

The difference between these two types of nouns is between inherently (orobligatorily) possessed nouns and optionally possessed nouns (Payne 1997: 40-41, 104-107) (roughly, inalienably and alienably possessed nouns). Inherently possessed nouns inSidaama include nouns that refer to animate possessors’ body parts that are essential orare not easily removable, kinsmen, spatial relations, and inanimate possessors’ parts andspatial relations.11         However, if the referent of the possessor is clear from the context, animatepossessors’ body parts and kinsmen can occur without a possessor specified.12 First,when possession is indicated with the verb of possession (af-i-- [find/get.to.know-EP-MID] ‘to get, have’) or in the predicative possession construction (see section 3.1.2.3),
11
  Nouns that refer to relatively easily removable parts of body (e.g., dananco ‘hair’, hinko ‘tooth’, mundee
‘blood’) can stand alone. For example, their nominative forms can replace lekka ‘leg’ in (3.35b).
12
  There is another type of case where the possessor is not required to be mentioned. When the general
function of a human body part is talked about, and the possessor is a person in general, it may not be
expressed, as in (i).(i)      wodan-u           bu’u     bu’u    y-ø-anno.

       The nominative case suffix replaces the final vowel of the basic stem of a noun.","[373, 374]"
"          There are three types of nominals that always take the allative case suffix -ra anddo not take the pronominal clitic =wa when used for the goal of a motion: masculineproper nouns for places, demonstrative pronouns, and locational nouns. All of thesetypes of nouns involve locations.18          First, when a masculine proper noun for a place precedes -ra, the noun is alsomarked with the genitive case suffix -i, to form “STEM-i-ra”, as in (4.101a) and(4.101b). When a destination is expressed with a feminine proper noun for a place, thenoun is used without any marker, and -ra is not used, either, as in (4.101c) and (4.101d).",[387]
"        Feminine and masculine nouns have different morphological case markingpatterns. For example, in (3.6) and (3.7) below, where the subject is a noun that can beused either as a feminine or masculine noun depending on its referent (manco ‘person’),the nominative case on the subject noun manco is unmarked when it refers to a woman,as in (3.6), and it is marked with the suffix -u when this noun refers to a man, as in (3.7).",[104]

“pronominal retention”, which is the term used henceforth to include the retention of thepossessive pronominal suffix and that of the pronominal object suffix as well as that ofthe personal pronoun). In (5.269) (repeated below as (5.272)), which uses the gappingstrategy (the gap is indicated with Ø), the relativized NP is the direct object of the verb inthe RC, and is not expressed in the RC; it would occur immediately before the verb of theRC if it were expressed in a sentence with the least marked word order. In (5.270)(repeated below as (5.273)), an example of pronominal retention, the possessivepronominal suffix -si, which refers to the relativized noun manco, is retained in the RC;the RC in (5.270), bule min-i-si-ra mar-t-ino, can stand by itself as a complete sentence,which means ‘Bule went to his house’. The relativized NP in this example is thepossessor of the goal noun followed by the allative suffix.(5.272)                                (a)      bat-t’-anno]       manc-i

           The issue of what types of constituents can be relativized was first taken up byKeenan and Comrie (1977, 1979, Comrie and Keenan 1979), who proposed the NounPhrase Accessibility Hierarchy shown in (5.274).(5.274)          subject > direct object > indirect object > major oblique case NP >
                 genitive (possessor) NP > object of comparison
They mean by “major oblique case NP” “NPs that express arguments of the mainpredicate, as the chest in John put the money in the chest rather than ones having a moreadverbial function like Chicago in John lives in Chicago or that day in John left on thatday” (Keenan and Comrie 1977: 66).","[641, 642, 643, 644]"

In one type of externalpossessor construction (Chapter 5 section 5.3.1, Kawachi 2006a, 2007b), the possessorNP is marked with the dative and the possessum NP is in the nominative and modified bythe reflexive pronoun in the genitive, which is coreferential with the possessor NP.","[206, 207]"

‘things’, re (SG: ricco ‘thing’), and serve as the noun-phrase clitic only when the referentof the NP headed by them is animate.58 Note that, as shown in (ii) in Table 3.18, there is
58
   The common noun for ‘a person’, manco and that for ‘people’, manna, are distinct in form from any of
the forms of this noun-phrase clitic.
          There are several reasons to say that =re is a noun-phrase clitic when the NP is animate, and the
morpheme of the same form (re) is the common noun for ‘things’ when the NP is inanimate. First, only
when the NP headed by it refers to an inanimate entity can it be modified by adnominals other than genitive
NPs and relative clauses (specifically, adjectives including numerals and adnominal demonstratives).
Second, like =ta (F)/=ha (M), =re can be used for an animate referent only when its referent is already
known to the conversation participants; on the other hand, if its referent is inanimate, it is free from such a
restriction. Third, re, whose referent is inanimate, is number-neutral, and can refer to singular as well as
plural inanimate entities, whereas NPs headed by =re have to refer to plural animate entities.
          However, there is one case where re can refer to animate entities. This transpires when followed
by one of the predicate forms of the noun-phrase clitic =ti in the predicate position, as in (i) and (ii).(i)      lat’o=nna                  bule               danura          sunk’-i-t-ino

no plural form of the noun-phrase clitic to be used in the predicate; plural NPs are eitherfeminine or masculine, and show agreement in gender with the non-plural forms of thenoun-phrase clitic.59 There is no plural form of this clitic to be used as a complementizer,either; as discussed later, there is actually neither a number nor a gender distinction madefor (iii), and =ta is used in most cases. In Table 3.18, there are two forms listed as non-plural, that is the feminine forms in (ii), =ti and =te; only =te contrasts solely in genderwith the masculine form =ho, and =ti is has differences from =te and =ho, which arediscussed shortly.

"The suffixation for the genitive case involves the replacement of the final vowel of thebasic stem of a noun by the suffix or the addition of the suffix to the basic stem. Thedative-locative case suffix attaches to the basic stem or the genitive stem of a noun. Theallative and ablative-instrumental cases always attach to the genitive stem of a noun. Thenominative, genitive, and dative-locative case suffixes on nouns can have different formsdepending on three factors: (i) whether the noun is common or proper, (ii) the gender ofthe noun, and (iii) (in the case of a common noun) whether or not the noun is Modifiedby another element.",[374]

4.2.2.1.3.2 Genitive Case Suffix and Suprafix         The genitive suffix-marking pattern is similar to the nominative suffix-markingpattern except that -te is used on Unmodified, feminine common nouns, as shown inTable 4.2. Note that the allomorphs -u and -i replace the final vowel of a noun stem,whereas -te is simply attached to a noun stem. The suprafix, which occurs as high pitchon the final vowel segment of the stem, is also employed for the genitive case marking.","[375, 376, 377]"
