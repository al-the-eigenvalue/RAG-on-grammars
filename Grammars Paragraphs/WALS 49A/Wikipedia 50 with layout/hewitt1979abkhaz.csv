    With the exception of masdars, the syntax of all deverbal
nouns is the same as that of non-derived nouns.     In the case of
masdars, what in the finite verb-forms would have been repres-
ented by a column I pronominal affix   (i.e. intransitive sub-
jects and transitive direct objects)  will be represented by a
column             II     affix            functioning                as    a     possessive             marker,            and    so,    to

this         extent,                masdars            behave         like        non-derived             nouns,            e.g.                   non-derived nouns.

1. Syntax
1.1.        General           guestions
   The preferred      method of reporting    speech is that of direct
quotation.     The  introductory   verb  (which will most     commonly be
a-h°a-ra   ‘to ,8ay ') usually   follows  the words   quoted,   e.g.
        a-         @°k’an       (g-)aa-                   de-        r-           t?-      aanja       s-gdlo-
        the        inn          it   (preverb)            they       cause        open     until       I stand-up
        m                                                                                                +(dyn.)
        not
         (d-) ye-heé-yt?
         it        he     say    (finite)
         ""He said:    ""I shall not get up until they open the inn.""'
We notice that the direct quote is not marked in any special
way.   However,    this is only because no words intervene between
the quote and its introductory verb and because this introduct-
ory verb contains only one pre-radical element       (namely the 3rd.
person   singular               human  column   III,    transitive    subject  pronominal
affix  ye-  - the               expected   column    I,  3rd.  person   singular  non-
human pronominal affix ye-, correlating with the direct object,
disappears when immediately preceded by its referent  (cf.
2.1.1.1.1 both for this phenomenon and for details concerning
the bound pronominal affixes appearing within the verbal
complex),    which    is here  the entire       direct  quote   itself).
Should   the   introductory    verb also contain        a column    II,   indirect
object   affix,    then  the direct     quote must be followed          by the
particle    h°a,  which    is actually     an archaic    form of the present
absolutive     of a-h°a-ra    'to say',      the more   common,   present-day
form of which would be h°o e*h°a-wa,              which  latter   form is not
found       in     this particular context  (there are no                                       pronominal af-
fixes       in     these absolutives because absolutives                                        of transitive
verbs  do not permit  the   insertion   of column     III,  transitive
subject affixes  (cf.  2.1.1.3),    and the column     I affix ye-    is
absent   for the same reasons    just advanced    to account     for  its
absence   in the introductory    verb  itself).     And so,   with   this
indirect           object       affix,      the     last       three       wordsof              the   example
above       would       be:
        -..S-gdlo-m             h°a   (g~)rt+            a-    s-h°e-yt’
                                      it     them+to           I    say        (fin.)
              ""I   told       them:   ""I    shall        not       get    up...""'
Indeed,  if the introductory   verb                                contains   any pre-radical    affix
in addition  to the  subject-affix,                                 there   is a preference   for hea
to be used,  e.g.
        ...8-golo—m             h°a   (g-)se-m-               hee-yt?
                                      it
                                 not say     I
                                             (fin.)
       ""I did not    say:   ""I shall  not get up...""'
If the pre-radical      affix  -amxa-   (cf.   2.1.3.4. 15)  appears   as the
single   additional    component   in the introductory      verb,  then hea
is obligatory,    e.g.
        -..S-gdlo-m             h°a   (¢-)s+amxa-                          hee-yt?
                                      it     I+unwillingly                 say         (fin.)
              ‘I   unwillingly           said:      ""I     shall         not     get     up...""'
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        7
Should          the     introductory            verb     precede            the      direct             quote,       then      h®a     (a)        Present
is    also       obligatory,            e.g.                                                                                                       ye-q’a-                      s-c’?6-             yt?

    The appropriate interrogative pronoun/adverb (cf.2.1.2.6.2)

rising intonation,    e.g.

Introduction
According to the last census for which figures are available
 (1970), there are 79,835 speakers of Abkhaz   (excluding speakers
of Abaza, of which there are about 25,000 - see below) within
the USSR.    The vast majority of these live in the Autonomous
Soviet Socialist Abkhazian Republic, which lies on the coast of
the Black Sea in the north-west of Soviet Georgia,     and whose
capital is Sukhumi.    Although the three official languages of
the     Republic               are       Abkhaz,        Russian          and    Georgian,            this        last        is    not
widely         known,           but,       as     many         settlements           from       Sukhumi          southwards
represent             a    mixed          population             of    Abkhazians             and    Mingrelians,                  the
third         language              of    most     of     those        Abkhazians             living        in    this        area
is Mingrelian.    Note  that                              an indeterminate    number of both
Abkhaz  and Abaza  speakers                               live in Turkey   and possibly  other
Near     Eastern               countries.
Abkhaz is             a member of the small and homogeneous North West
Caucasian             language-family, whose two other members are
Circassian                (Cherkess)              and     the        almost     extinct            Ubykh,        which,
since the Russian subjugation of the North Caucasus in 1864,
has been spoken only in Turkey.    Abkhaz may be divided into two
main dialectal groups:  (i) Abaza, which is spoken outside
Abkhazia in the  Karaéay-Cerkessk Autonomous Region and which
consists   of the two dialects T°’ap’anta   (phonetically   the most
complex  of all the Abkhaz-Abaza   dialects   and the basis    of the
Abaza literary language)  and A&’xar; (ii) Abkhaz proper, spoken
in Abkhazia and comprising the two dialects of Bzyp, phonetic-
ally     the     more           complex           and     spoken         to    the      north       of    Sukhumi,            and
AbZui,         which           is    the       basis      of     the     Abkhaz         literary          language            and
which         forms        the       immediate            object         of    the      present          study.
The first alphabet for Abkhaz was established in 1862 by Uslar
 (Lomtatidze,  1967.101), but widespread publication of materials
in Abkhaz became the norm only in the Soviet period, during
which time three main     (plus two minor)     orthographies have been
tried - (a) Latin-based      (1928-38),   (b)    Georgian-based (1938-54)
 (c) Cyrillic-based   (from 1954)    (ibid.   102), which latter con-
tains fourteen characters not found in Cyrillic but which is
regrettably inconsistent in its marking of glottalisation and
aspiration.    It is interesting to note that the Abaza ortho-
graphy,  which   is also                          based         on    Cyrillic,  employs   only one
additional   character,                           which         is    used exclusively   to indicate
glottalisation.","[1, 2, 3]"
