"                                       2. Chali178. The following postpositions occur:
        ku ‘from, in’
        u ‘from, in, with’
        (e)ndu ‘in, with’
        (r)a ‘for’
        a ‘in’ (rare)
179. ku ‘from, in’ is used only for a person (cf. § 180), e.g.
         Cha. piar-om ku dval-ager ‘ask (of) my father’
                pul piar-i ku uger ‘get money from your father’
                cemen pia11 ku hbccd eb ni ‘there is no blemish in my
                father’
                Samamadio ku em rasm ni ‘this custom does not exist
                among the Shah-Mohammadis’
Note:
 When an animal or inanimate object is personified, then ku is used instead of u, e.g.
        Cha. asbe ku vafa pisa begir ‘learn faithfulness from dog[s]’
              gave ku aval ager ‘ask the bull’
              deraxte ku aval ager ‘inquire of the tree’
        (cf.  deraxt-u becin ‘pick from the tree’
              asb-u be dara ‘come down from the horse’)180. u This postposition has a very wide range and use in Chali, but is
not used except for animals and objects (cf. § 179). Most frequently, it
means ‘in, within, inside’ (probably its primary meaning), but also ‘from,
out of’ (second most frequent meaning), and ‘with’. It may also follow
a direct object.
   When a noun ends in -a, the postposition u and the final -a merge into
6, (v. § 81, c); the stress of the 6 depends on that of-a.
           Cha. garo {i.e., gara + u) ‘in the cradle’
                   piar-i kid {i.e., kid + u) ‘in your father’s house’
                   kid moma ‘I come from the house’
                   xdlo {i.e., xdla + u) zamin di ‘give fertilizer to the land’
                   tuard aber-ard ‘he brought out the nosebag’ 11   Sic. One would expect piar (obi.).

     The following uses of u were attested:
       a) with a locative sense, e.g.
              Cha.    em amberaz-om sanduq-u andas ‘I found this clothing in
                      the trunk’

                     kion-u ‘in the houses’
                sar taxt-u unest ‘he sat on the throne’13
b) with an ablative sense, e.g.
            Cha.     sildnaka derdxt-u becind ‘pick ye apricot[s] from the
                     tree’
                     kia-ydn-u ‘from your house’
                     ba sare sd:r-u abar-misi ‘you go out from the other end
                     (lit. that end) of the city’14
      Cf. Pers. dar rah-e kasi kesidan ‘to suffer for someone’.
13    From a number of examples it seems that when the verb denotes movement the
trun '’ehn ^'15 n0t f0l'/°Wed         amberdz ™ sanduq-u yi ‘the clothing is in the
trunk , but dasin mo sanduq-e throw [it] into the trunk’; ddz unest mo sdt-u ‘the thief

wlfrbt           ’ h°)VeVer’ the usagc is inconclusive, e.g. jay iz-u beso ‘he went in his
iootstepts , but doz beso mo sat-e ‘the thief went into the courtyard’. In most cases the
locative object of ‘to go’ is followed by u.
    Cf. the colloquial Persian equivalent: az an sar-e sahr dar-miri.
                              POST- AND PREPOSITIONS                         121                    asb-u be darn ‘dismount (lit. come down) from the horse’
                    xdv-u pa-misi ‘you (sg.) get up from sleep’
                    be sdt-u abar-sia ‘she went out of this courtyard’
                    Ramanda kuh-u ‘from the Mount Ramand’
c) with an instrumental sense (i.e., where Persian uses ba), e.g.
            Cha.    samsir-u ay-son banjand ‘they cut him into pieces with
                    [a] sword’
                    je-son gust maqas-u becind ‘they cut (past) his flesh with
                     scissors’
                    zerzer e taqtaq-u ‘with cacophonous sounds’15
                    dallak Safar-u ‘with Safar the barber’
                    ndz-u pa-mi-bi ‘you get up with airs and graces’
                    amberaz-om-u begeratom ‘I took [it] with my clothes’
                    bomenda qoron-u sa:m-u ‘they came with [a] Koran and
                    with candlefs]’
d) In a number of examples, u follows a definite direct object, e.g.
            Cha.    ah-u mikasi ‘you sigh (lit. you draw sigh)’
                    ah-em-u kasast ‘I sighed’
                    sar-u yarem ‘[that] I set out to wander’16
Since u-kasasen does not exist in Chali as a complex verb (according to
Ameli), and u-yarden as a complex verb means only ‘to kindle’, one is
not encouraged to consider u in the last three examples as the otherwise
common preverb u- (v. § 263).
     e) Some uses of u present a problem. In a number of examples where
the verb has both an accusative and a dative object, u follows the accusa¬
tive and precedes the dative object,17 very much like a preposition mean¬
ing ‘to, toward’, e.g.
            Cha.    pul u piar-i di ‘give money to your father’
                    varge xesten u cuaro zanind ‘the wolves throw themselves
                    upon the sheep’
                    xolo (i.e., xola + u) zamin di ‘give fertilizer to the land’
                    qand u zamin ni ‘put the sugar down (lit. on the ground)’
                    mb:r u zamin ni ‘put the [praying] tablet on the ground’
                    pul u cemen di ‘give me money’
            cf.     pul u ja:va ni ‘put the money in the box’
In this usage u may be separated from the accusative object by an
enclitic pronoun, e.g.15
     zerzer and taqtaq are onomatopoeia.
16
     Cf. the similar Persian idioms sar konam, sar begodaram (be sahra‘).
17   Which, if singular and inanimate, has an uninflected form (v. § 156).
 122                               MORPHOLOGY            Cha.    dim-es u biabon yard ‘he turned his face toward the
                   desert’
                    das-em u esta damdn ‘[I stretch] my hand to your skirt
                   (i.e., I beseech your help)’
 If the dative object is not mentioned, u disappears and the accusative
object appears in the general oblique form, cf.
           Cha.    bar u zamin dsin ‘throw the door onto the ground’
                   bar u bon dsin ‘throw the door onto the roof’
             (but bar-e basin ‘throw the door’)
                   gel u difar ger ‘stick the mud to the wall’
             (but gel-e soft a-yar ‘make the mud thick’)
                  dvo (i.e., ava + u) raz di ‘give water to the garden’
             (but ava bebar ‘take away the water’)
When u is used as a postposition following a dative object, u may not
at the same time precede the dative object, cf.
                   Hasan-e pul u jar xaka yar ‘place Hasan’s money under
                   the earth (i.e., inter it)’
             (but Hasan-e pul jar-u diar18 ‘hide Hasan’s money’ (jar
                  ‘beneath’,19 Pers. zir)
The above examples encourage one to consider u also as a preposition
preceding a dative object. There are, however, the following points to
be taken into account:
   i. When the order of the objects is reversed, i.e., when the dative
precedes the accusative, u generally disappears and the dative assumes
the oblique form, cf.
           Cha.    gel u difar ger ‘stick mud to the wall’
             (but difar-e gel deger ‘stick mud to the wall’)
                   zur u zamin di ‘give fertilizer to the land’
             (but zamin-e zur undi ‘give fertilizer to the land’)
ii. When the accusative object is a person, u disappears, cf.
          Cha.     quc u pain19 dsin ‘throw down the ram’
             (but zaro (i.e., zaru + e, v. § 81, e) pain dsin ‘throw down the
                  child’)
                   barro (i.e., -a + u, v. § 81, c) bon dsin ‘throw the spade,
                   [up on] the roof’
             (but Hasan-e bon dsin ‘throw Hasan [up on] the roof’)18 According to Ameli Hasan pul u jar u diar is impossible. From the following
example it seems that when the verb has the -u- prefix, u does not precede the dative
object: zur u zamin di / zur zamin undi ‘give fertilizer to the land’.
19 An adverb which can be used as a noun.
                            POST- AND PREPOSITIONS                              123Considering i. and ii. and the general absence of genuine prepositions in
Chali, plus the fact that -u does follow the accusative object in some
examples when no dative object is required (v. above, d), one might
tentatively set up the following rule: in a number of cases u may be used
as a postposition for a non-human accusative object when a dative ob¬
ject of the same verb follows.20
  181. -(e)ndu This postposition is primarily used in the instrumental
sense, but also occasionally in the meaning of ‘together with’ and ‘in’
(a meaning primarily expressed with the postposition u).
  It occurs as -endu after a consonant, -ondu with words ending in -a or
-d, and -ndu after -i or -u. Examples:
          Cha.    Hasdn-endu kdr ddros a-mi-be ‘with Hasan (i.e., through
                  Hasan) the job will be fixed’
                  tir-endu/bdrrdndu/xoyydndujcuarondu me-ne-be21 ‘it can¬
                  not be done with beam[s]/spade[s]/shovel[s]/sheep’
                  sava ses saat e mm-indu ‘at six thirty in the evening’
                  bomenda dayro ye zernS-ndu ‘they came with hautboy
                  and tambourine’
                  esta tete vazi-ndu-ind ‘your daughters are playing (lit. are
                  in play)’22
                  ruberu-ndu ‘face to face’
182. (r)d This postposition means ‘for, to’, and occurs as ra after a
vowel and y, and a after a consonant, e.g.
          Cha.    be jar jown-e ra ‘for such a youth’
                  sarab-es be-bard jay ra ‘he carried wine to him’
                  esta ra nakugari miarom ‘I will help you (lit. will do
                  goodness to you)’
                  Hasan-e ra bdj ‘tell Hasan’
                  umal-Sn-es-a maje ‘he tells his mates’
                   ta berasasen-a ‘before reaching (lit. until reaching)’
                  asbSn-a ci undi ‘give something to the horses’
                  purar-es-a ‘for his son’
                  da: man raz ma:rie-s-a masinom ‘I grant (lit. throw) ten
                   mans of vineyard23 as her marriage portion
20 In cm janjal u darasin (i.e., dara + asin) ‘throw down this threshing machine’,
dara ‘down, below’ has to be taken as used substantively. In xoruze darasin ‘throw
down the cock’, however, u does not appear.
21 The plain forms are Hr, bdrra (f.), xoyya, and cuara.
22 Cf. esta tete vastemon-u-ind ‘your daughters are dancing (lit. are in dancing)’.
23 I.e., a piece of vineyard producing ten mans (unit of weight) of grapes in a year.

                   da ‘in’
           .
     185 xo Unlike Chali ku, which is used only for persons, xo is used for
  both the animate and the inanimate (cf. §§ 179, 195, a,), e.g.
                   Tak.      bar-e xo mix-e bar-ar ‘pull out the nail from the door’
                             bila (f.) xo gibe pak a-yar ‘wipe the mud from the spade’

                             with me’
 bi tends to palatalize the oblique ending -e into i, e.g.

                   Xaje Kowus-i bi ‘with Xaje Kavus’
       .
 187 ra ‘for, to’. This postposition is used in a dative sense, e.g.
                   Tak.      Hasan-e ra mavdtan ‘don’t tell Hasan’
                           fel-em add xesta ra ‘I gave money for brickfs]’
       .
 188 a ‘from, of, than, on, in’ (cf. Chali, u § 180). Examples:
a) in the sense of from, than, of’ (corresponding to Perisan az), e.g.
                   Tak.    Amir-Husang-a xor-tar zomd heskas nie ‘there is no
                           son-in-law better than A. H.’

189. da The postposition da ‘in, from’ is preceded in all my examples
by the postposition a (above), of which it only amplifies the sense. On
formal grounds one may consider ada as a single postposition meaning
‘in, from’, but in addition to the fact that a appears also singly, my
informants considered -da an independent particle, and I have followed
their distinction. Examples:
     a) in a locative sense, e.g.

Xoz.             -TO          -i         -s         -mun             -yun          -sun
Notes:
   1. In Chali the final -n of the plural pronouns is generally omitted, as in the oblique
plural of nouns (v. § 106), and even before a vowel it appears rarely. For -d, v. § 32.
  2. In Takestani the -u- of the plural pronouns has a range between [o] and [u] (v.
§ 43).                                                                               .     x
  3. In Takestani and Sagz-abadi an additional form, -(e)t (a borrowing from Persian),
occurred for the 2nd person singular in the following examples:
           Tak. sad toman-et mirijeme ‘I spend (lit. pour) a hundred tumans on you’
           Sag. ioi-et masa (127) ‘may your lung[s] swell!’
9 Cf. Resala, 68-9.
10 Cf. A. A., 173, 175.
11 -en ending appeared in the material collected from B. Dana’i of the Upper District.
N. Dana’i of the Lower District, however, regularly had -on for -en.
     154                                MORPHOLOGY     221. When the enclitic pronouns are attached to a word ending in a con¬
     sonant, a connective vowel precedes them (but v. § 225), except in the
     second person singular, which itself consists of a vowel. The connective
     vowel is generally -e-, save when preceded or followed by y, notably
     before the enclitic pronoun of the 2nd person plural (-yon, etc.), where it
     appears as      e.g.
               Tak.      az gandem-e-m esta-ra bord ‘I brought wheat for you’
               Xoz.      mast o panir-e-sun sa-mida ‘they are making yogurt and
                         cheese’
               Tak.      vind-ion (<-e-yon) ‘you saw’
               Esh.      nun-iun (<-e-yun) bexard ‘you ate bread’
 Before -m of the 1st person singular the connective -e- is frequently
 rounded int o; in Chali this is generally the case, e.g.
               Cha.      amberdz-o-m ‘my clothes’
               Tak.     del-e-m ‘my heart’ (v. §27, fn.)
 222. The enclitic pronouns may function as: a) genitive, b) object of a
 verb, and c) agent in a passive construction. Examples:
      a) as a genitive, generally with a possessive sense,
               Cha.     piar-dm ku ‘from my father’
              Tak.      berd-m buma ‘my brother came’
                        agar layeq-es nie ‘if he is not worthy of it’
              Esh.      bazr-es be-ohdeye camaya ‘its seed[s] is our responsibility

                        carva-s berut-es ‘he sold his sheep’
                        az o a bara-mun basindbevast-enmn ‘I and he threw down
                        our spades and fled’

                        elahi qorbun-e-y (sic) gardem ‘may I become sacrificed
                        for you (sg.) (lit. your sacrifice)’
                        ermaz-es tan-es ca ‘he put on his clothes’
                        meraxxasi-em (95) ‘my leave’
              Dan.      geysen-es bo ‘bring his ploughshare’

                    back of the door’
b) as the object of a verb,

             Sag.   bediam-es (95) ‘I saw him’

c) as an agent (v. § 332, c),

                    gandem-(i)yun ard ka ‘you ground the flour’
                    farfa-s derut ‘he swept the snow’
             Ebr.   veya ke megovest-esen bdrenda ‘[when] they wanted to
                    bring the bride’
                    Hasan o Hosayn dozde-son13 begerat, ji-son xeyli beza
                    ‘H. and H. seized the thief and beat him exceedingly’

             Xoz.   yew-es mikard ‘he used to sow barley’
223. The enclitic pronouns function as the agent only in a passive con¬
struction (v. § 222, c). In this function they may be the sole agent of the
verb, e.g.
             Ebr.   basi-son zamin, xafa-son ka ‘they threw him on the
                    ground [and] strangled him’
or the resumed agent of the verb, e.g.
          Xia. az Hasan-em bevind ‘I saw EE’
             Sag.   Mammad Hasan-es xacar ujirat ‘M. married H.’s sister’
             Esf.   soma nun-io bexord ‘you ate bread’
224. As an agent, or a resumed agent, the enclitic pronouns may be
suffixed to a noun, an adjective, an adverb, a pronoun, a conjunction, or a
verb. When the logical direct object is a noun or a pronoun, the enclitic
pronoun is commonly suffixed to it. When the logical object is not men¬
tioned, or is a clause (as is generally the case with the verb ‘to say’),
it is the verb that most frequently attracts the enclitic pronoun. When the13   According to the pronunciation of the Lower District; v. § 220, fn. 11.

 pronoun. Examples:
    a) attached to a noun (the object),
            Cha.    em amberaz-om sanduq-u andas ‘I found this dress in the
                    trunk’
                    em zania-so xurde pul-a-yard ‘they made this woman [as

                   poorly’

                                     PRONOUNS                            157
intransitive verb, referring back to the subject of the verb, e.g.
            Tak. belangasce (i.e., -st-se, v. below) ‘he limped’
            Sag. hammam-esun besu (103) ‘they went to the bath’225. In Takestani a stem-final dental stop (-1, -d) of a transitive verb
merges with the 3rd person singular enclitic pronoun -s into an affricate
c, which is generally followed by a euphonic -e (v. § 298). The same
phonetic change occurs in the 3rd person plural, although much less
frequently, since in this case more frequent use is made of the connective
vowel (v. § 221), which separates the enclitic pronoun from the verb.
           Tak.    vace < vat-s-e ‘he said’
                   borce < bord-s-e ‘he brought’
                   vacun < vat-sun ‘they said’
                   borcun < bord-sun ‘they brought’
By extension, this form may occur even when the enclitic pronoun has
appeared earlier in the sentence, e.g.
           Tak.    xazza-s bexarce ‘he slid (lit. he took a sliding)’
                   av gandem-es jdve-ra beborce ‘he brought wheat to him’
                        5. Possessive Personal Pronouns226. As has been seen (§ 217), oblique personal pronouns are used also
as possessive pronouns and adjectives. Examples:
           Cha.    em cemen-e ‘this is mine’
           Tak.    az este-yme ‘I am yours’
           Esh.    cemen-ya ‘it is mine’
           Xia.    anai savi ba ‘bring his shirt’
           Sag.    besa jem kid (119) ‘go to his house’
           Dan.    ceme armaz bo ‘bring my clothes’
           Xoz.    cemen dasa bigi ‘take my hand’
V. § 217, a for further examples.
Enclitic pronouns (§ 220) may also function as possessive pronouns, e.g.
           Tak.    das-em-a yd darzena ‘there is a needle in my hand’
           Dan.    bara-m adi da besarn ‘give [me] my spade, so that I go’
                   geysen-i anemidam ‘I don’t give [you] your ploughshare’
V. 222, a for further examples.
227. In Chali the following set of pronouns, made up of the oblique
personal pronouns (v. § 217) and the suffix -kin, are also used as possessive
pronouns:
        Cha.       cemenkin ‘mine’
                   estakin ‘thine’
                  jaykin ‘his’
 158                                 MORPHOLOGY                    jayakin ‘hers’

                    jayokin ‘theirs5                    cemenkin niago-ye ‘mine is here’
                   jaykin kiago-ye ‘where is his?5
                   Cf. eskakin ‘whose?5                       B. DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS                                1. General Remarks 228. Southern Tati has a system of two demonstrative pronouns,
 proximate and remote, with at least two forms for each: direct and
 oblique. Some of the dialects possess additional forms of the oblique:
 Chali has two additional sets, here called agential (v. § 230, c) and post¬
 positional (v. § 230, d). Takestani, Ebrahim-abadi, and Esfarvarini also
possess additional oblique demonstratives (v. below under each dialect).
   Gender is distinguished in both direct and oblique demonstrative
pronouns, except in Ebrahim-abadi ma ‘this’ (masc. and fern, sg. dir.),
and Xiaraji and Ebrahim-abadi a ‘that5 (masc. and fern. sg. dir.).
   The declension of the demonstrative pronouns follows the nominal
pattern always in gender (v. §§ 104, 133), often in number, and sometimes
also in case, e.g.
           Xia.    andi ‘that5 (masc. sg. obi.)
                   andi-a ‘that5 (fern. sg. obi.)
                   andi-un ‘those5 (pi. obi.)
The 3rd person singular of the personal pronouns is identical with the
remote demonstrative pronoun.           The proximate pronoun is also fre¬
quently used as the 3rd person singular of the personal pronouns.
  The use of the direct and the oblique case generally follows that of the
personal pronouns (v. below and §§ 214, 217).
   The direct demonstratives are used as the subject in all the dialects
and as the agent in all but Chali, which has separate agential demon¬
stratives, and Eshtehardi, which employs the oblique demonstratives for
the agent.
  The oblique demonstrative pronouns are used as a genitive (mainly
possessive), as the object of a verb,16 and as the object of a postposition.
    The differentiation between the definite and indefinite object naturally does not
arise with pronouns.
                                      PRONOUNS                                      159   Only in Ebrahim-abadi were separate demonstrative pronouns observ¬
ed in reference to inanimate objects (v. § 238). In Sagz-abadi gender is
distinguished in the singular oblique only when it refers to the animate.
   229. Demonstrative adjectives17 have fewer forms than demonstrative
pronouns, since generally gender and number are not distinguished in
them (v. below under Esh., Xia., and Sag. for exceptions).
   Whereas the direct demonstrative adjectives are always the same as
the demonstrative pronouns, the oblique ones have separate forms,
except in Eshtehardi, where the direct is used also for the oblique cases,
and in Sagz-abadi, which uses the oblique form of the demonstrative
pronouns also as demonstrative adjectives.
   In Xiaraji, Esfarvarini, and to a lesser extent Chali, however, the use
of the oblique demonstrative adjectives is not consistent, and the direct
is used also for the oblique (v. under each dialect).
   The demonstratives in each dialect will be treated separately below.
Demonstrative adjectives follow demonstrative pronouns under each
dialect. For a chart of the demonstrative pronouns and adjectives, v.
§§ 248-50.","[155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161]"
"                          2. Oblique Personal Pronouns217. Oblique personal pronouns, basically collocations of prepositions
and oblique forms of the personal pronouns, are used also as possessive
pronouns and adjectives.3 They function as the genitive, as the direct,
indirect, and postpositional object, and in Eshtehardi also as the agent
in a passive construction. Chali has a separate set of agential pronouns
(see below).
   The oblique-possessive personal pronouns are:
           me           thee     him      her        us        you            them
Cha.       ceme(n)       esta    jay      jdya       cema      soma          jaya

    2. 2nd person singular. - In most dialects the e- of esta has a range between e and i
 (v. §§ 27, 39). V. § 72 for the reduction or dropping of e-.
    3. 3rd person singular. - As in the direct case, these are employed also as demon¬
strative pronouns. Often the proximate demonstrative pronouns, too, are used as
personal pronouns (v. § 229ff.). The gender is distinguished in the oblique of the 3rd
person singular, which is not always the case with the direct (v. above).
    In Takestani, jave is also used besides jd(v) for the masculine (an influence of the
nominal oblique form? Cf. Sag.jem-e, etc. v. §§ 240, n.L; 248, n.).
   In Xiaraji indi (m.)/india (f.) ‘this’ are also frequently used as personal pronouns. In
the Resala, 61, undi and undiun are given for the 3rd person singular and plural,
respectively. The two forms are given by A. A., 170-171, as possessive and accusative
pronouns, but they are not attested in his texts.
   a and aha given by A. A., 171, as 3rd person singular and plural accusative pronouns
are, in fact, direct case pronouns. As a demonstrative adjective, however, a is used also
in the oblique function.
   In Ebrahim-abadi, whereas the demonstrative pronouns jijjia (m., f.) ‘that’, jime/jima
(m., f.) ‘this’ are employed for the animate, ana ‘that’ and mana ‘this’, which do not
show gender, are used for the inanimate (v. §§ 338-39).
   4. 2nd person plural - In Danesfani double plural forms comaha and somahd also
occur (v. below). In Esfarvarini somdye bindo ‘you saw’ points to an extended form of
soma.","[151, 152]"
"                  B. GENERAL FEATURES OF THE DIALECTS
The most characteristic features of Southern Tati dialects may be sum¬
marized as follows:
 1. The distinction of feminine gender in nouns (v. § 92 ff.), pronouns
(v. § 213 If.), and verbs (v. § 269 ff.).
   2. The retention of an oblique case in nouns and pronouns (v. §§ 99,
104, 105 ff.).
  3. The preservation and extension of an oblique case in -r (v. §§ 100,
104 ff.).
  4. The absence of the ezafa construction as a genuine form (but v.
§ 147), and the use of the antecedent genitive or adjective instead (§ 204).
     5. The frequent use of postpositions as against prepositions (§175 ff.).
     6. The use of the same pronouns as possessive and oblique pronouns
(v. §§213, 217).20
   7. The use of the passive construction with past transitive verbs and the
consequent difference in the conjugation of transitive and intransitive
verbs (v. § 331 ff.).
  8. The retention of an old mode of the passive formation in verbs
(v. § 341).
   To these features is to be added the tendency among the dialects to
treat the animate and the inanimate differently in a number of cases. For
instance, Chali and Xiaraji use the postposition ku ‘in, from for the ani¬
mate, but u for the inanimate (§§ 175, 176, 179, 180, 192); Ebrahim-abadi
employs different demonstrative pronouns for persons and things: jime/
jima ‘this’ (masc. & fern.) and ji/jia ‘that’ (masc. & fern.) for persons, but
mana ‘this’, ana ‘that’ (without distinction of gender) for things (§ 238);
Sagz-abadi makes the distinction of gender in demonstrative pronouns19    Cf. A.A., p. 17.
20    Chali, however, has preserved a set of ‘agential’ pronouns (v. § 218).
22                               INTRODUCTIONonly when it refers to the animate (§ 240). Often a dative or accusative
object, when not defined by an adjacent word, is expressed in the oblique
only when animate (v. §§ 90, 154 ff.).
  No attempt has been made here at a definitive grouping of the Tati or
Southern Tati dialects; it has been left for a subsequent work. However,
some general remarks concerning the relative position of the dialects
may be made.
 The dialects, which properly speaking should be termed sub-dialects
(v. p. 17, fn. 4), may be divided first into Ramandi and Eshtehardi. The
Ramandi group consists of all the dialects spoken in the Ramand region
and also the dialects of Takestan, Ebrahim-abad, and Sagz-abad.21 The
geographical proximity of the Ramand villages corresponds to their close
linguistic affinity.
   Eshtehardi, on the other hand, is spoken in a different bakhsh, and the
geographical distance between Eshtehard and Ramand is reflected in the
linguistic differences of their dialects. Whereas the Ramandi dialects are
easily mutually intelligible, Eshtehardi is a little less readily understood
by Ramandi speakers.
  Eshtehardi differs from the Ramandi dialects by a combination of
features, the most important of which are:
     1. The ending -ehd for direct plural nouns (v. § 114).
     2. The possession of an oblique feminine singular ending for nouns
(-d), absent from the other dialects (v. §§ 104, 114).
     3. The limited use of the oblique nouns in -r (v. § 140).
     4. The ending -sin for the 2nd person plural in the imperative and the
past tenses of intransitive verbs (v. §§ 300, 317 ff.), and the present and the
subjunctive of the subatantive verb (v. § 347 ff.).
     5. A more rigorous application of the passive construction (v. § 331 ff.).
     6. The absence of the postpositions u/ku, a or a, and the presence of the
postposition beja ‘with’ (v. §§ 175, 190).
     The Ramandi group may in turn be divided into Northern and Southern.
Northern Ramandi comprises Takestani, Esfarvarini, and Chali, with
yar/yard ‘to do’ as the most readily noticeable unifying isogloss of the
group, as against karjkard in Southern Ramandi.
     Of the Northern Ramandi group, Chali appears to be more conserva¬
tive, as exemplified by its retention of agential pronouns in addition to the
oblique ones.
     Takestani, on the other hand, is morphologically and syntactically less21 Although these three villages do not technically belong to the Ramand rural
district (see above), they are actually a natural part of it and lie at its borders.
                                   INTRODUCTION                               23conservative, as shown by the weakness of its passive construction and the
loss of its direct plural ending, replaced by the oblique plural ending -on
(v. §§ 87, 111, 331). It differs sharply from Chali in its use of the postposi¬
tions a(da) ‘in, from’ and bi ‘with’, for Chad u and (e)ndu (v. § 175 ff.).
      Esfarvarini, true to its geographical location, occupies a place between
Chali and Takestani. It has not retained the agential pronouns, but has
kept the distinction between direct and oblique plural endings (v. § 130).
      Esfarvarini differs from Chali and resembles Takestani in its use of the
postposition -a (§ 200) and of a as the feminine form of ‘is (§ 347), but
resembles Chali and differs from Takestani in its dropping of the final -n
of the oblique plural ending before a consonant. It differs from both in
its direct plural ending -end (v. § 130) and in its oblique demonstrative
pronouns (v. §§ 244, 248).
  Southern Ramandi comprises Xiaraji, Xoznini, Ebrahim-abadi, Danes-
fani, and Sagz-abadi.
  Among the common features of this group, apart from close affinities
in vocabulary, are the development of ev from u (e.g., Xia. pevl ‘money’,
sev ‘husband’, pew ‘son’), and the ending -id for the 2nd person plural
of the present of the substantive verb (v. § 348 ff.; cf. Cha. -id(n), Esf. yo(n),
Tak. -ion, Esh. -.sin). To these may be added in general terms the form of
the 3rd person singular of the preterit of the verb ‘to be’ (v. § 355) and the
reduction of the modal prefix be- to b- and the devoicing of it before a
voiceless consonant (v. § 73).
  Sagz-abadi pronunciation is distinguished by a very advanced articu¬
lation of k and g (generally pronounced c and j, v. § 62). Ebrahim-abadi
uses the passive construction more conservatively than the rest of this
group (§ 331). Danesfani on the other hand, like Takestani, has lost its
direct plural ending for nouns (v. § 126).","[23, 24, 25]"

                     jay-ku ne-bu ‘it was not in that one (m.)’
c) agential (these have no counterpart among demonstrative adjectives;
v. § 218),

             Cha.    yi javab bat ‘this one answered’
                 yi bi dgerat ‘this one smelled [it] (lit. took smell)’

                     yd men ugerat ‘I picked up these’
                     ayd uger ‘pick up those’
Notes:
   1. Re3a’i sometimes used ay as the direct object, and considered both ay and ay
permissible. In the common phrase ay bigi yi var-di ‘take this one and leave that one’,
however, he constantly used ay, which seems to be the original form, ay may have
developed partly by the influence of the direct demonstrative a ‘that, he’, and partly to
avoid confusion with the plural ay ‘those’ (direct), which seems to have lost a final
unstressed -e.
  2. In one instance Re3a’i used em and a as direct objects:
                  emlla uger ‘pick up this/that one’
and thought that when it is a question of choosing one object from several, em/a is
used rather than yi/ay. However, the following example indicates a certain vascillation
between the direct and the agential:
               Cha. em beniago barzom ‘let us leave this [topic] here’.18
     ji andy/a are not to be confused with the dem. adjs. je and ja; v. § 231, b.

231. Chali demonstrative adjectives are:
                       direct21       oblique        postpositional
           prox.         em            je              be
           rem.           a              ja             ba
In Chali demonstrative adjectives, gender and number are not generally
distinguished, but traces of a gender distinction are occasionally found.
   a) Direct demonstrative adjectives are used for the subject and agent,
e.g.
           Cha.    em handond xware ‘this watermelon (m.) is good’
                   em kaleka xware ‘this melon (f.) is good’
                   em/a kaleke xwarend ‘these/those melons are good’
                   em qocejmise bexorde ‘this ram/ewe has eaten’
Note:
  Occasionally, instead of em for the feminine, ema 22 which distinguishes the gender,
occurs, e.g.
            Cha. ema kaleka pise ‘this melon is bad’
           (cf.   em/ema misa berxin ‘buy this ewe’, v. below)b) Oblique demonstrative adjectives are used for the object of a verb
(but v. below) and the object of a postposition, e.g.
           Cha.    undi je purelteti ‘give to this boy/girl’
                   je aftav-on-u ‘in this sunshine (lit. in the suns)’
                   je mas cemen di ‘give me of this yogurt’19 I.e., bia + u., v. § 81, c.
20 I.e., baya + u. Cf. be-niago, je-niago ‘from here’.
31 The terms dir. and obi. do not closely reflect the function of the dem. adjectives.
They are chosen to correspond to their counterparts in dem. pronouns.
33 Re3a’i considered this the older but rarer form. He generally used em with the
feminine nouns, but could remember his uncle’s comment ema misa kid a misa kid, an
idiomatic expression meaning ‘one cannot compare this ewe and that one (lit. where
this ewe, where that ewe!)’.
 162                                MORPHOLOGY Note:
   Sometimes, however, the object is preceded by a direct demonstrative adjective, e.g.
          Cha. em qocolmiso berxin ‘buy these rams/ewers’ c) Postpositional demonstratives are generally used with nouns followed
 by ku or u in their ablative sense, e.g.
           Cha.    be pure ku / teti ku uger ‘get [it] from this boy/girl’
                   ba mardake ku / zania ku uger ‘get [it] from that man/
                   woman’
                   be sat-u ‘from this courtyard’
                Cf. be-niago23 besa ‘go from here’
                   aga be-niago23 towfir dere ‘“there” is different from
                   “here”’
 Sometimes the postposition does not appear, but its meaning is implied
 in the demonstrative adjective, e.g.
           Cha.    be-(s)sar ‘from this end’
                   ba-{s)sar ‘from that end’
                                  3. Takestani232. Takestani demonstrative pronouns are:

          oblique                je               ja
Xiaraji uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun ema also as an adjective,
e.g.
          Xia.      ema bara (f.) xara ‘this spade is good’
              Cf. em xuyyd (m.) xara ‘this shovel is good’
The use of ema with feminine nouns is not, however, constant; cf.
                    ema magowa baw ‘bring this cow’
              but em beza (f.) pa deband ‘tie this goat’s foot’
Xiaraji direct demonstrative adjectives are employed also in oblique
cases as shown by the above two examples; cf. further the following:
         Xia.       em bar beba najjdre var ‘take this door to the carpenter’
                    em Hasane tetar bigir ‘marry this daughter of H.’
                    em qoce pa deband ‘tie this ram’s foot’

Gender is not distinguished in the direct singular (ma, a), but is distin¬
guished in the oblique I, when used for a person (cf. lack of gender
distinction in Xiaraji a ‘that’, § 236). For the object of a verb, separate
pronouns ('mana, ana) are employed in which gender is not distinguished.29
     Oblique II is used in the dative and ablative sense, and also with the
postposition -a ‘in, from’. In the latter case a connective -r- generally
precedes -a (v. § 76). For jendi cf. Xiaraji indi (§ 236) and Esf. jindia
(§ 244). Fory'wa cf. Esh.jua (§ 234) and Esf.juro (§ 244).
  -e in jime is probably an adoption of the nominal oblique ending (cf.
Sag.jeme, § 240; cf. further
             Ebr.     kemin naku-tar-e ‘which is better?’ (direct)
                   but kemin-e ungurem ‘which shall I take?’ (oblique)
where the oblique of the interrogative pronoun is patterned after the
oblique nouns). Examples:
     a) direct,
             Ebr.     mala xare ‘this/that (f., m.) is good’
                       mahen xarenda yd dhen ‘are these good or those?’
b)   oblique I,
     i. as a genitive,
            Ebr. jemen men-a dere,jien men-a ni ‘it is inside of these, it is
                  not inside of those’
ii. as the object of a verb,
            Ebr.      jime/ji bebar ‘take this/that one (m.) away’
                      jima/jia bebar ‘take this/that one (f.) away’
26 -e- is close, nearing i.
27 -a- in mahen is a close variety, apparently by the influence of -e-.
28 Normally dhen, occasionally aha, according to B. Dana’i of the Upper District.
29 I have no examples referring to animals, mana and ana examples were all obtained
from N. Dana'i from the Lower District. In these examples they do not appear as a
subject.

 168                               MORPHOLOGY -yn in plural demonstratives is but faintly pronounced and is generally a
 subdued [ji].
   The feminine jema and jia are employed only when the noun to which
 they refer is animate, e.g.
           Sag.    jia bebar ‘take her away (referring to a cow)’
                   jema hamra ujer ‘lift together with her’
When referring to an inanimate feminine noun, a masculine demonstra¬
tive is employed, e.g.
           Sag.    jem ujer ‘take this (referring to asua ‘apple’, f.)’
Notes:
   1. The -e of jime, jie, and jo we is probably the oblique ending adopted from the
nominal inflection (cf. Tak. jive, Ebr. jime, Dan. jeme; v. § 238).
  2. In a number of instances in A. A., jeme varies with jimi, e.g.
            Sag. jeme tah-es (119) ‘its bottom’
                   jeme xushali (119) ‘his joy’
                  jimi palev (105) ‘at his side’
                  jimi hamra (113) ‘together with him’
Cf. a similar variation between e and i of the singular oblique ending, § 172 a, n.
  3. jo we appears in the following examples:
            Sag. jowe-r-u ujer ‘lift by [means of] that’
                   mejow jowe-r-a bexoram ‘of that we must eat’
           Cf.     Tak. jav, Esh. jua (§§ 232, 234).","[161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170]"

                       F. VOWEL COMBINATIONS
81. The following instances of external vowel sandhi were observed in
Chali:
  a) Unstressed -a + -m > -dm, e.g.
                                       GENERAL                                       57                    xwakom ‘my sister’
                    mayakdm ‘O, my little mother’
                    Zivarom bind ‘I saw Zivara’
b) -a, -a + -e > e,5 e.g.
                    norce (obi. of norca, i.e., norca + *e) ‘novice’ (v. § 108, a)
                    zome (obi. of zomd) ‘son-in-law’ (v. § 108, a)
                    ema pise < *pisa + e ‘this (f.) is bad’
                    bettajase < -a + *e ‘he has run’
c) -a -f- unstressed -u > o,6 e.g.
                    xdlo < xola + u ‘in ash’
                    xdko < xdka + u ‘in earth’
                    kid < kid + u ‘in the house’
d) -a, -a + -i > e, e.g.
                    e < a -f i ‘he too’
                    ante < ama + i ‘we too’
                    a:re < a:ra + i ‘tomorrow too’
                    Zivare bind < Zivara + i ‘you (sg.) saw Zivara’
e) -u + -e > d, e.g.
               zaro < zaru + *e ‘children’ (v. § 110)
                    nakko ‘it is good’ < nak(k)u + e
For 6 and e v. §§ 28, 32.
   For -a + a- > 6, v. § 360, n. 3.
Notes:
   1. In the other dialects, cases of vowel sandhi are more limited. Reference is made
to some in the footnotes below. Generally, an unstressed i preceded by a vowel except
i (v. § 74) changes to y (but v. d, above). Examples:
             Cha. morda sure-y bebara lit. ‘may the corpse-washer carry you!’
            Tak. bogo-y ‘that you want’
                   te-y da ‘and you, too’
             Esh. cama-ymun ‘we are’
                   -m arda-y ‘I have given’
             Xia. bare-y anemidiun ‘we do not give you (sg.) your spade’
             Ebr. kua-y barde ‘where have you carried?’
2. Notice the change of -e ‘is’ to -y after u in the following Chali example:
                   em xav-u-y ‘he is asleep (lit. he is in sleep)’
                                      G. STRESS82. Word stress is distinctive in Southern Tati, e.g.6 -a + -e (unstressed) results in -i also in Ebrahim-abadi, e.g. xoyi, obi. of xoyd
‘wooden shovel’. In the other dialects the combination results in ey [ej, e:], e.g. Dan.
kiey, obi. of kid ‘house’ (v. § 28).
6 In Esfarvarini the combination results in -o, e.g. sar raho ‘on the road’ < rdha + u.

                   vatan ‘to say’
                   vatan ‘say!’ (imperative)
The stress, however, is governed by certain rules which make its position
generally predictable. Normally, word stress is weak and dominated by
sentence stress and intonation.7
The main rules governing stress are the following:
                            1. Nouns and Pronouns83. a) All uninflected masculine nouns are stressed on the final syllable,
e.g.
          Cha.    zdru, Tak. zarin, Esh. lazak ‘child’
         Cha.     tarikd, Tak., Esh. tarekd ‘darkness’
b) Feminine nouns ending in -a are accented on the penultimate syllable,
e.g.
         Cha.     Tak. asra ‘tear’
         Cha.     Tak. cela ‘staff’
         Esh. angusta ‘finger’
Exceptions (v. also § 98, n.):
         Cha.     zania ‘woman, wife’
                  nana ‘mother’
                  allud (?) ‘prune’
                  konya ‘wise and able woman’
  By stress in this section the dominant word stress is meant.
                                  GENERAL                                   59c) Adjectives follow the nominal pattern, but the stress is noticeable in
adjectives only when they are used predicatively; in attributive adjectives,
which generally precede the noun (v. § 204 If.), the stress falls on the noun,
e.g.
          Cha.   Hasan zurin-e ‘Hasan is strong’, but
                 soza deraxt ‘green tree’
Nominal forms of verbs (masc.) are also stressed on the last syllable, e.g.
          Cha.   berotan (infin.) ‘to sweep’
                 berota (past part.) ‘swept’
                 beroja (pres, part.) ‘sweeping, sweeper’
                 vastemdn (verbal noun) ‘dancing’
d) In compound nouns only the second element is stressed, e.g.
          Cha.   izom beskenj ‘wood-cutter’
                 via deraxt ‘willow tree’
          Tak., Esh. va-tura ‘foolish talk, nonsense’
e) Of the nominal inflectional morphemes, -e (for sing. obi. and pi. dir.)
is unstressed; Esh. -ehd (for pi. dir.) is stressed on the second syllable;
Esh. -d (for fern, obi.) is stressed. All plural oblique nouns are stressed on
the final syllable. (V. § 133 for a chart of inflectional endings and § 104 If.
for examples.)
  /) Independent pronouns and pronominal adjectives also follow the
nominal pattern as described above, e.g.
          Cha.   cemen ‘I’
                 em (masc.) ‘this’
                 ema (fern.) ‘this’
                 erne ‘these’ (dir.)
          Xoz.   andiun ‘they’ (obi.)
Enclitic pronouns are unstressed, e.g.
          Cha.   bdt-eson ‘they said’
          Tak.   bord-emon ‘we brought’                                   2. Verbs
84. a) The imperative, the subjunctive, and the optative are stressed on
the first syllable, which is normally either a preverb or, failing that, the
modal affix be (v. §§ 300, 304), e.g.
          Cha.   d-pors ‘ask!’
          Esf.    ugur ‘take!’
          Xoz.    bevaz ‘run’
          Dan.    uxarend ‘that they drink’
          Tak.    beskenjem ‘that I break’
  60                                   PHONOLOGY  b) The present indicative is stressed on the first vowel of the ending (v.
  § 302), e.g.
             Cha.     misom ‘I go’
             Xoz.     mi-gen-end(a) ‘they fall’
  c) In the preterit and the imperfect the stress falls on the last syllable of
  the past stem (v. §§ 316-17 for the perfect), e.g.
             Cha.    biusend-dm ‘I boiled’
                     be-parras ‘it flew’
             Esh.    gahast-im ‘I became’
             Cha.    mi-ttajas(s)-end ‘they used to run’
             Dan.    de-rund-es ‘he swept’
             Tak.    mastd-ymon ‘we used to stay’
             Esh.    mi-vast-isin ‘you used to run’
 d) In periphrastic tenses the auxiliary element(s) are unstressed, the stress
 falling on the last syllable of the main verb component, e.g.
            Cha.     binde-yi ‘you (sg.) have seen’
                     bomia bu ‘he had come’
            Esf.     bevasta bem ‘I had run’
            Ebr.     besiififi ‘she had been gone’
            Cha.    beskiasa bia bu ‘she had been broken’
 e) The negative and prohibitive morphemes always take the stress, e.g.
         Cha. ma-sa ‘don’t go’
            Tak.    ah ma-kas ‘don’t sigh’
                    u-m-m-listem ‘I did not lick’
                    me-na-stayme ‘I did not stay’
/) In compound verbs the first element is stressed, the subsequent ele¬
ments losing their accent, e.g.
            Cha.    vir-ardem ‘I reminded’
                    veld-ha-bend ‘they dispersed’
           Tak.     rdh-asinem ‘that I set in motion’
           Esh.     da:vd-mun gahaste ‘we have fallen into a quarrel’
For further details v. under relevant headings in the morphological
section.
Note:
   The verb stress pattern sketched above, however, is not quite stable in all circum¬
stances and is often changed to comply with intonation pattern; for instance, the stress
of the subjunctive, normally placed on the preverb or on the affix be-, is commonly
shifted to the ending when the verb is used in a conditional clause followed by the
apodosis, e.g. ['aege rej bi'nomT d3£Ej ra ma'd30m|] ‘if I see him I will tell him’.
   In periphrastic tenses the stress is transferred to the last syllable of the auxiliary
when they are used with a conditional sense, e.g.
  Esh. ['aegae a buwaejta; bi'’Jasf] ‘if she had run’.
                                      GENERAL                                       61
                                 H. INTONATION
85. The intonation pattern of Southern Tati requires more study than my
notes permit. Three main types of phrase-final intonation may be distin¬
guished in Chali and Takestani: falling, level, and rising. Affirmative
phrases tend to end in a falling intonation, as a rule; this is more obvious
when the phrase ends in an unstressed syllable, e.g.
           Cha.    Hasan-e pia\ apdra\ bemdrd] ‘Hasan’s father died last
                   year’
           Tak.    coma kia\ kifcina sdra\ dare] ‘our house is at the head of
                   the alley’
The rising intonation appears, generally, in suspensive clauses, i.e., those
requiring or presupposing a sequence or an answer (interrogative, con¬
ditional, vocative clauses, and the like), e.g.
           Cha.    age besom | ta soma hamberd bebarom] dir dmibe]
                   ‘If I stay to take you along it will get late’
                   bdtes\ Hasan] ‘He said: “Hasan!”’ (in a warning tone)
In coordinate clauses, when the idea has not been completed the level
intonation is employed, e.g.
           Cha.    i tana xwaka bomia pdrdn\ bates]
                   ‘One of the sisters came forward [and] said’
                   ta bas\ ta binom] ‘you stay, so that I see’
86. The rising intonation may replace an adverb of subordination, e.g.
           Tak.    carba sar arbeni tamon a-be]... ‘[when] the cutting of the
                   sheep’s throat (lit. head) became completed...’
           Esh. gowem bi]mdla mizenun] ‘[when] it becomes (lit. became)
                   half-dry we trawl (the land)’
           Xia.    az andim bevind] bevastema] ‘[as soon as] I saw him, I ran
                   away’Notes:
   1. These brief remarks on intonation of S. Tati, however, are merely selections of a
much wider range of possibilities which still need to be investigated. Thus, various
factors such as the mood and the intention of the speaker may affect the intonation
pattern radically.
   2. Further phonological remarks may be found in the following sections, as they
arise in connection with morphological discussions.

MORPHOLOGY
                                         I. NOUNS
87. Nouns fall into two classes: masculine and feminine.                  Nominal
declension presents a system of two numbers, singular and plural, and a
system of at least two cases, direct and oblique.","[58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]"
" Examples:
      Ebr. masc. sg. dir. i dena xar bev jel-es ne da ‘there was a donkey
                               [which] did not have a horse-cloth’
           fem.     sg. dir. Hasan-e xara bemia ‘H.’s [female] donkey came’
           masc. sg. obi. sang mazan ja bare ‘don’t throw stone[s] at that
                               door’
           fem.     sg. obi. das mama! beza ‘do not touch the goat (f.)’
                            jel uni xara sa ‘put [a] horse-cloth on the donkey’
                    pi. dir. quc-en be send cul ‘the rams went to pasture’
                             rayyat-en agardastend ‘the farmers returned’
                             asifen (f.) kelmejin bar-emend ‘the apples turned
                               out worm-eaten’
                             cema zema(h)en27 bemenda ‘our sons-in-law came’
                    pi. obi. cema qocen/misen beba cul ‘take our rams/ewes to
                               pasture’
                             xoyen pak-a-ka ‘wipe the shovels’
                             asben-a yew undi ‘give barley to the horses’
The feminine nouns do not change in the oblique singular, e.g.
            Ebr.     misa beba becergen ‘carry the ewe [and] graze [her]’
                     jel uni xara sa ‘put a horse-cloth on the donkey (f.)’
                     Zinata ra ewa ge-be ‘fetch water [and] bring [it] for
                       Zinata’122. Nouns in stressed -a have their singular oblique in -e, e.g.
            Ebr.     xoye gel pdk a-kar ‘wipe the mud off the shovel’ (xoya
                       ‘shovel’)
(f) Sagz-abadi123. The case endings of Sagz-abadi are:
                        Singular                  Plural
                  masc. dir. nil                  dir. -e (unstressed)28

                  fem. dir. and obi.    -a (unstressed)
27  In rapid speech: zemavn, zemayn.
28  In hama car-a tamun a-be, A. A., p. 103, -a appears to be an adoption of the Persian
-(h)a; cf. the use of -ha in the plural of the pronouns, § 214.
                                         NOUNS                                     83Examples:
  Sag. masc. sg. dir.         varg begini ‘[that] the wolf fall’
        masc. sg. obi.        undi pinaduj-e ‘give to the cobbler’
        fem.      sg. dir.    beza bevasta ‘the goat (f.) ran’
        fern.     sg. obi.    beza mev qeyci ka ‘shear the goat’s hair’

                  pi. obi.    qucun uger besa ‘take the rams [and] go’
124. The feminine morpheme drops out in the plural, e.g.
           Sag.     cema xace (sg. xdca) umeynda ‘our sisters came’
                     misun (sg. mis a) uger beset ‘take the ewes [and] go’
125. a) Nouns in stressed -a have their direct plural in -(y)n, with -a
palatalized into -e, e.g.
           Sag.      bddieyn (sg. badia), sowen29 (sg. sowa), xuyyen (sg. xuyyci)
                     beskiastend ‘bowls, jars, shovels were broken’
b) Nouns in -a add -yn in their direct plural, e.g.
           Sag.      cemd zumayn, berayn cua jardastend ‘our sons-in-law
                       [and] brothers gathered together’
c) In the plural oblique -a and -a drop out before the plural morpheme,
e.g.
           Sag.     badiun (sg. badia) pora car ‘fill the bowls’
                    zummun (sg. zuma) aziat ma-car ‘don’t bother the sons-in-
                       law’
Note:
 The plural of zaru ‘child’ was given as zaruun.(g) Danesfani126. The case endings of Danesfani are:
                     Singular                         Plural
                    masc. dir. nil                    dir. -on
                    masc. obi. -e (unstressed)
                    fem.      dir. -a (unstressed)
                    fem.      obi. -a (unstressed)    obi. -on
Examples:
      masc. sg. dir.          Hasan boma ‘Hasan came’
        masc. sg. obi.        Hasane vari besa ‘go with Hasan’
                              Hasane das besut ‘Hasan’s hand was burned’
29 -en appears to be a shorter form of -eyn. In the following example the final -« did
not appear:
          Sag. cema dadey (sg. dadd) cua jardastend ‘our fathers gathered together’
 84                                       MORPHOLOGY           fem.     sg. dir.    beza bevasta ‘the goat ran away’

                                vin joma awa ia yd nia ‘see [whether] there is
                                    water in the bowl or there isn’t’
           fem.     sg. obi.    beza vari ‘with the goat’
                                ceman beza sar-es birbin ‘slaughter my goat’
                                beza-ra alaf adi ‘give grass to the goat’
                                basin mon tana ‘throw [it] in the oven’
                    pi. obi.   berar-un-es i-s buma parun ‘of his brothers one
                                    came forth’
127. The feminine morpheme coalesces with the postposition -a ‘in,
from’, e.g.
             Dan.     vin tana atas ia ‘see [if] there is fire in the oven (f.)’
                      tana atas bar-o ‘take out [some] fire from the oven’
                      beza matars ‘don’t be scared of goat[s]
128. Nouns in stressed -a have their oblique singular in -ey {-y being
generally faint; v. §28). Examples:
             Dan.     kiey difar ‘the house’s wall’
                     furey30 qadam nakue ‘a boy’s birth is of good omen
                        (fit. a boy’s step is good)’
             Dan. ja furey ku xabar agi ‘ask from that boy’
 129. Nouns in -a and -u do not change in the singular oblique, e.g.
             Dan.     carva pus berus ‘sell the sheep’s skin’
                      carva ku alafe agi ‘take [away] the grass from the sheep’
                      du vari oxa ‘drink [it] with buttermilk’
                      uni Hasane sar zenu ‘put [it] on Hasan’s knee’(h) Esfarvarini130. The Esfarvarini case endings are:

            fem.      sg. dir. and obi. -a (unstressed)
The -n of the plural oblique appears only when a vowel follows. Examples:
     Esf. masc. sg. dir.       ke varg cara-s para niari ‘so that [some] wolf
                                    would not tear his sheep’

134. a) Nouns denoting family relationship (mother, father, brother, sister,
son-in-law, etc.) form their singular oblique by adding -r to their un¬
inflected form (stressed -ar when the noun ends in a consonant),32 e.g.
          Cha. pio-m boma ‘my father came’
                    piar-om hambera besemo ‘we went together with my
                       father’
Whereas in Eshtehardi the oblique in -/• appear to be dying out (v. § 140 ff.),32   -(a)r is derived from the sing. obi. ending of Old Iranian words in -tar, -ar (v. Grim,
irati. Philol., I, § 185 and cf. BSOAS, XXII, 1, 1959, p. 57). This ending is extended
first to nouns denoting family relationship but not ending in original -tar, -ar, e.g.
zana/zanar ‘wife’, and then to nouns denoting a person.
                                        NOUNS                                      87in the other dialects its use has expanded to include in certain circum¬
stances the singular oblique of nouns denoting a human being, e.g.
            Cha.    je dohe varziar-ar amsala bar nard ‘the farmer[s] (obi.) of
                    this village did not get [any] crop this year’
b) Nouns denoting a human being, but not a family relative, have their
singular oblique in -r generally only if they are defined by a genitive or a
possessive pronoun or adjective. Otherwise, their oblique form follows the
general rule (v. § 104ff.).
     c) Proper names do not form their oblique in -r, but follow the general
rule.
     d) The words for ‘woman’, ‘girl’, and ‘boy’ are, unlike Persian, general¬
ly distinguished from their close cognates meaning ‘wife’, ‘daughter’, and
‘son’, respectively,33 not only in their plain form but also in their in¬
flection. The words for ‘woman’, ‘girl’, and ‘boy’ never show an oblique
in -r but generally form their oblique according to the common rule.
     The details concerning each dialect are given separately.(a) Chali135. An oblique in -r is found in Chali for all nouns denoting a human
being, except proper names (v. below for some other exceptions), e.g.
            Cha.    pia/piar ‘father’
                     maya/mdr ‘mother’
                     xwaka/xwakar ‘sister’
                     zomd/zomdr ‘son-in-law’
                     umi/umiar ‘father’s brother’
                     dayildayar ‘mother’s brother’
                     hivar/hivarar ‘husband’s brother’
                     hova/hovar ‘co-wife’
                     xosura/xosurar ‘husband’s father’
                     nomazd/nbmazar ‘fiance’34
                     varziar/varziarar ‘farmer’
                     eupun/cupunar ‘shepherd’35
Examples:
        Cha.         teti piar bat ‘the girl’s father said’
                    pul piar-i ku uger ‘get money from your father’33    The distinction is, however, secondary, and each pair has the same base. Cf. Tak.
zeynia ‘woman’, zana ‘wife’; tetia ‘girl’, teta ‘daughter’; fera ‘boy’, fer ‘son’. The
following exceptions occur: Cha. zania ‘woman, wife’; Esh. fura ‘son, boy’; teta
‘daughter, girl’; v. below, under each dialect, for details.
34 The obi. of nomazi ‘fiancee’ is also nomazar; cf. § 109, b, n.
35  Among some speakers cupon.

                   piar-dm ku aval-om agerat ‘I inquired from my father’
             but   pio-m boma ‘my father came’
     136. For nouns not denoting a family relationship, however, the
oblique in -r is employed only when the noun is defined by a preceding
genitive or a possessive adjective or pronoun.
     Examples in -r:
           Cha. je dehe varziar-ar ... bar nard ‘the farmer[s] of this village
                          did not get (lit. bring) crops’
                    cema cupun-ar amsala xdd-es molk berxind ‘our shepherd
                       himself bought [some] property this year’

                   cema cupun-ar ku ‘from our shepherd’
                   Hasane cupun-ar sar ‘the head of Hasan’s shepherd’Examples in -e:
                   em cupun-e xeyli pul andas ‘this shepherd acquired much
                     money’
                   em varziar-e bar nard ‘this farmer did not get crops’
                   em zome (cf. § 108, a) kanara ni ‘put aside this son-in-law’
                   cupun-e ku aval-ager ‘ask the shepherd’
                   je cupun-e ku ‘from this shepherd’
                   cupun-e sar masken ‘don’t break the shepherd’s head’
                   Cf. § 90.
Notes:
 1. In genitival compounds denoting a cousin, the genitive element follows the general
rule (v. § 106) and does not appear in -r, e. g.
            Cha. day(i)a teta ‘mother's brother’s daughter’
                   xa/aka pur ‘mother’s sister’s son’
                   bibia tetalpur ‘father’s sister’s daughter/son’
            but piar-zan ‘step-mother (lit. father’s wife)’
2. Only piaro(n) ‘fathers’, beraro(n) ‘brothers’, and mard(n) ‘mothers’ were attested
to be based on the oblique in -r. Other oblique plurals followed the general rule.
137. teti ‘girl’, pura ‘boy’, zania ‘woman’ do not have an oblique in -r.
The inflection of these nouns and their close cognates meaning ‘daughter’,
‘son’, ‘wife’, respectively, is as follows:

 The oblique of xostan ‘self’ is xostanar, e.g.

Note:
   In the following examples fere instead of ferar appears as the oblique (indefinite) of
fer ‘son’ (cf. the common rule, § 111):
            Tak. fere ra zev nabayad zeynia gerdan ‘one must not take a wife for
                  [one’s] son too early’
                  az fere xo xeyr-em nevindi ‘I have not seen any good from a son’
                  fere mogo borestan madrese ‘one must send a son to school’
(c) Eshtehardi140. The oblique in -r is preserved in Eshtehardi only in a few instances
and generally is rarely used. It was attested in xdka/xakar ‘sister’, zena/
zenar ‘wife’, and titia/titiar ‘daughter’ (v. also § 141, fn.), e.g.
           Esh.     xakar-em buat ‘my sister said’37
                    xordeka xakar-i bar enda ‘bring your little sister here’
                    Hasane zenar-da arga ‘take from Hasan’s wife’

                    your daugther?’38
Note:
The most common term for sister, however, is bajia, which follows the general rule of
declension (v. § 114), e.g.
                   beseym bajia-m niun ‘I went to my sister’s’
141. Eshtehardi nouns in -a, denoting family relationship, do not change
in the singular oblique, e.g.
          Esh. bera-m buat ‘my brother said’36 An idiomatic phrase to express fondness and devotion.
37 However, sometimes the oblique in -r is replaced by the general oblique in -a, e.g.
xuaka-m buat ‘my sister said’.
38 But also tetia, e.g. ddraye seshaf tetid-iyim ‘I have [some] six [or] seven daughtet [s].

  142. The Eshtehardi word for both ‘boy’ and ‘son’ is fura, for both ‘girl’
 and ‘daughter’, tetia; but zenia ‘women’ is distinguished from zena
 ‘wife’ (cf. §§ 137, 139).       In compounds, however, ‘son’ appears in its
 short form, fur, e.g.

 Note:
 Interesting is zan-daid, the singular feminine oblique of zan-daia < Pers. zan-da'i (‘wife
 of mother’s brother’) in the following example:
            Esh. ba:d besem zan-daia-m pa:lu ‘then I went to my uncle’s wife’
 where dai (masc.) as part of a feminine compound attracts a feminine ending. (d) Xiaraji 143. The rules given for Chali oblique in -r (v. § 135) apply also in
 Xiaraji. Examples:
            Xia.    ddda-m alaf-es unda carva ra ‘my sister gave grass to
                    [the] sheep’
                    dadar-em das berbiniasta ‘my sister’s hand is cut’
                    nanar-i sang pardow maka ‘don’t throw stone[s] at your
                    mother’
                    amiar-em aziat maka ‘don’t harm my uncle’
                    sake rayyatar aziat maka ‘don’t harm the king’s subject’
                    xostan-i rafiqar ra awa beba ‘take water to your friend’
                    ceme dosmanar bezan besi ‘hit my enemy [so that] he
                    goes away’
144. The Xiaraji words for ‘woman/wife’, etc. (v. § 137), follow the
inflection pattern given for Chali:
                               dir.                obi.
           woman             zenia               zenia
           wife              zena                zenar
           girl              tetia               tetia
           daughter          teta                tetar
    In piar-zena step-mother (lit. father’s wife)’, however, the older word for ‘father’
with the oblique in -/* is retained.

                   do kadxodar bigi ‘seize the headman of the village’40 Pronunciation of -v- is faint.
41 In xoda rayyat-e mazzan ‘don’t beat God’s farmer’, although rayyat is preceded
by a genitive, yet xoda is not actually defining rayyat, since all rayyats are supposed
to be God’s; therefore, the oblique in -e is used.

  Note: In Esfarvarini rayyat and copon differed in their singular oblique in the fol¬

          Ebr. coma copon-e mazan ‘don’t beat our shepherd’
                  coma rayyat-ar mazan ‘don’t beat our farmer’
In Xoznini, too, the following examples show a similar difference of treatment:
          Xoz. Hasane rayyatar I cupune bo ‘bring H.’s farmer/shepherd’146. The pattern for the inflection of words for ‘woman’ and ‘wife’,
‘girl’ and ‘daughter’, and ‘boy’ and ‘son’ in Ebrahim-abadi, Sagz-abadi.
Danesfani, Esfarvarini, and Xoznini follows, with minor differences,
that of Chali (v. § 137); the words for ‘woman’, ‘girl’, and ‘boy’ do not
have an oblique in -r, but follow the general rule, e.g.
                 dir. and obi.
                 zania/zania42                   ‘woman’
                 zana/zanar                      ‘wife’

                povr/ferar (sic.)                ‘son’*2 E.g., zania nakue na miardd ‘[a] woman is nice, not [a] man’; zania ku betars
‘beware of [a] woman’; zania meraz esta dard ne-mixua:re ‘[a] woman’s clothing is
no good to you’; zania his vax aziat maka ‘don’t ever harm [a] woman’.
    This unusual shift of accent, which I reproduce with some misgiving, is based on
the following examples given by N. Dana’i (Lower Dis.): fern tetid nakutar-e ‘[a] boy
is better than [a] girl’; a tetid ku xoSom nemia ‘I don’t like girl[s]’;/d tetid bew ‘bring

147. Ezafa construction — As a rule, the dialects use the antecedent
genitive (v. § 160), but the ezafa construction, borrowed from Persian,
occurs occasionally in all the dialects, particularly in affected speech, e.g.
            Cha.    ey padesah-e Rum ‘O king of Rum!’
            Tak.    rev-e avval ‘the first day’
                   yon-e zaron ‘life of the children’
                    ta Amir Arsalan-e Rum-isa ‘you are A. A. of Rum’
            Esh.    i otaq-e cubi beja ‘with a wooden room’
            Xia.    bara-s post-e bar-u ugera-sa ‘he picked up his spade from
                       the back of the door’
                   dar fasl-e beharun ‘in the season of spring’
148. In a few examples in Chali the second word of the ezafa construction
(mudafun ’ilayhi) appears with an unstressed -e at the end, apparently the
singular oblique ending, e.g.
         Cha. masqul-e becindan-e migardom ‘we get busy picking’
                   dar ahd-e Sah Abbas-e bu ‘it was during Shah Abbas’
                   time’
                   avval-e payz-e misom ‘we shall go in the beginning of
                   autumn’44   The oblique singular does not occur in my material.
 96                                 MORPHOLOGY
                         E. USE OF THE NOMINAL CASES                                 1. General Remarks
 149. a) Variations in the function of the cases, both within a dialect and
 among the dialects, may generally be ascribed to the weakening use of
 the oblique case and the increasing function of the direct. This is best
illustrated by the treatment of the agent in the passive construction (v. §
 331 IT.) and of the object of a verb (v. § 154 flf.).
     b) In the singular, nouns denoting human beings are more conservative
in the retention of the oblique case endings, nouns denoting animals less
conservative in this respect, and nouns denoting inanimate objects least
conservative.
  c) With the object of a verb, the use of the singular oblique case
generally serves to define the object (v. § 90).
     d) Except in Eshtehardi, the logical direct object in a passive con¬
struction is generally treated as a direct object in a non-passive con¬
struction, because of the weakening of that construction.
     150. The direct case is employed for the following:
           a)     the subject (v. § 151)
           b)     the vocative (v. § 152)
           c)     the agent in most of the dialects (v. § 153)
           d)     some verb objects (v. § 154ff.)
           e)     the object of some postpositions (v. § 159)
The oblique case is employed for the following:
           a)     the genitive (v. § 160)
           b)     the agent in a number of dialects (v. § 153)
           c)     some verb objects (v. § 154 flf.)
           d)     the object of some postpositions (v. § 159)
                                   2. The Subject151. The subject is expressed in the direct case45 in all the dialects.
Examples:
           Cha.     Hasanak ham ce bajom ce sa-mida ‘and how shall I
                    describe what Little Hasan does’
           Esh.     i titiaka kid da nesta bia ‘a little girl was sitting in the
                    house’45   In Takestani and Danesfani the plural direct and oblique have the same ending-
v. § 105.
                                        NOUNS                                        97           Esf.    kiand xarab a-bind ‘the houses were ruined’ (v. 130, n. for
                   kiand)
                                  3. The Vocative152. The vocative is expressed in the direct case, e.g.
           Cha.     zoma-jon-om xos omes ‘you are welcome, my dear
                    bridegroom’
           Esh.    yd Hoseyn dad-em beras ‘O, H., come to my rescue’
(v. § 161, b, n. 1. for a Chali exception.)Note:
  In a Xiaraji example, the feminine morpheme is omitted after a feminine proper
name (v. § 120). Whether this is the case in some of the other dialects requires further
investigation. This is not the case with feminine nouns in general; cf.
           Cha. kalaca-cesma, esbia-dandona ‘O thou, of black and white eye[s and]
                  white teeth (sg.)’
           Tak. ey Narga nuya vaya ‘O new bride of Narga!’                                    4. The Agent153. In the syntactically more conservative Chali and Eshtehardi, the
agent, that is to say, the logical subject of a past transitive verb (v. §§ 103,
fn., 331 ff.) is expressed in the oblique.46 In Ebrahim-abadi the agent is
often expressed in the oblique, particularly in the speech of the older
generations, whereas in Xiaraji it is generally put in the direct case and
only occasionally, among some speakers, in the oblique. In the other
dialects the agent is expressed in the direct case.
     1. Examples of the agent in the direct case:
           Xia.  dada-m magawa-s bedust ‘my father milked the cow’
            Sag.    ta quce jem alafesun bexwa bemardend ‘as soon as the
                    rams ate the grass they died’
            Xoz.    xarin bezastinda ‘the donkeys gave birth’
2. Examples of the agent in the oblique case:
        Cha. sah-e bat ke ilci benda xedmat ‘the king said that the
                    envoys should come to [his] presence’
            Esh.    sir-e gawa beskiast ‘the lion crushed the cow’
                    gawd sir beskiast ‘the cow crushed the lion’
            Ebr.    asb-e ewa-s dxa bemard ‘the horse drank the water [and]
                    died’
46   Cha. has even preserved a set of separate agential pronouns, v. § 218.

                                      5. The Object          .
 154 The basic case of the object of a verb is the oblique, as is evident
 from the case of plural objects,47 e.g.
              Cha.    ta rafiqo bini ‘so that he may see the friends (def. dir.
                     obj.)’
                     demasasimo mardbmd ‘we stuck to the people’
              Esh.   Hasane sivun ce-s-da ‘give H.’s apples to him (inanimate
                     obj. defined by a genitive)’
              Sag.   cappunun aziat macar ‘don’t bother the shepherds (def.
                     dir. obj.)’
                     besa Hasane razon ‘go to H.’s gardens (indir. obj.)’
              Ram. *besa bagd mardemun hun-zan baynda cema kid (57)48 ‘go
                     there [and] call people (pi.) to come to our house’
 In the singular,49 however, the oblique case tends to give way to the
 direct in a number of instances. The direct case is employed: i) when
the direct object is indefinite; ii) when an inanimate direct object is de¬
fined by a genitive or a pronominal adjective; iii) when the object is an
indirect one; and iv) except in Eshtehardi, when the object is a logical
direct object in a passive construction.(a) Indefinite Object (cf. § 88 ff.)      .
155 The singular indefinite object is expressed in all the dialects in the
direct case. To make such an object definite, the direct case is replaced
by the oblique. Examples:
              Cha.   alaf undi cuare ‘give grass to the sheep’
                 (cf. alafe undi cuare ‘give the grass to the sheep’)
              Tak.   saba gandem bar ‘tomorrow grind wheat’
                 (cf. gandeme bar ‘grind the wheat’)
              Esh.   misa alaf mixare ‘the ewe eats grass’
                 (cf. misa alafe mixare ‘the ewe eats the grass’)
              Xia. pevl Hasane di ‘give money to H.’

indefinite plural sense, indef. dir. objects, plural in form, are bound to be rare.

156 The definite direct object, when singular, admits a variety of treat¬
ments with regard to its case. The main determining factors of these
variations are whether the object is inanimate, animate, or human, and
whether or not it is defined by an adjacent word.
  a) When the definite direct object is a person, it is expressed in the
oblique case (but v. § 158, n.). When the definition is by a genitive or a
pronominal adjective, the oblique in -r (v. § 134) is used even if the noun
does not denote a family relative (v. § 136). Examples:
          Cha.   Sah Ebrahim-e abar yard ‘drive out Shah Ebrahim!’
          Esh.   Maryamd (f.) doppara ka ‘halve Maryama!’
         Xia.    Hasan-e xosten-i hamra beba ‘take H. along with your¬
                 self’
                 sahe rayyat-ar aziat maka ‘don’t harm the king’s subject’
                 nanar-i sang pardow maka ‘don’t throw stone[s] at your
                 mother’
          Ebr.   ji cupen-e mazan ‘don’t hit this shepherd’
         Dan.    Hasan-e tetar agir ‘marry H.’s daughter’
b) When the definite direct object is an animal, generally the oblique
case is employed. When such an object is defined by an adjacent genitive
or a pronominal adjective, occasionally the direct case is employed for
the singular. In careful speech, however, the oblique form tends to be
restored. Examples:
         Cha. cemen ostbr-e berxin ‘buy my camel’
         Esh.    Hasan-e taki (v. § 116, a) bebar tavila ‘take H.’s [male]
                 goat to the stable’
         Xia.    ja qoc-e beba ‘take away that ram’
                 Hasan-e qoc-e mazan ‘don’t hit H.’s ram’
                 cema qoc-e hun-zan ‘call our ram’
         Sag.    asb-e qason ka ‘groom the horse’
c) 1. When the definite direct object is inanimate, it is generally expressed
in the oblique case if it is not defined by an adjacent word, e.g.
         Cha.    zamin-e zur undi ‘give fertilizer to the land’
                 pul-e jaru-diar ‘hide the money’
         Tak.    alaf-e qoc-a agi ‘take away the grass from the ram’
         Xia.    difar-e xarab a-ka ‘pull down the wall’
         Esh.    sareyna (f.) zamin-e da ‘give [animal] fertilizer to the land
 100                                   MORPHOLOGY Only occasionally is such an object expressed in the direct case.
 2. When such an object is defined by a genitive or a possessive adjective,
 it is generally expressed in the direct case, e.g.
              Cha.     cema zemin berxin ‘buy our land’
                       sat-e bar sa-bedi ‘mend the courtyard’s door’
              Tak.     ceme/Hasane gandem bar ‘grind our/H.’s wheat’
              Xia.     cemen jurab pina-ka ‘patch my sock’
                       Hasan-e pavjar beduj ‘sew H.’s shoe’
              Sag.     cemen armaz pinia-ka ‘patch my clothes’
              Dan.     carva pus berus ‘sell the sheep’s skin’
              Esf.    Hasane das dommas ‘hold [on] to H.’s hand’
3. When defined by a demonstrative adjective, such an object is more
often than not expressed in the oblique case. In my Takestani, Ebrahim-
abadi, and Danesfani examples, all such objects are in the oblique. In
Chali and Xiaraji both forms were attested, e.g.
              Cha.    em zamin{e) berxin ‘buy this land’
              Xia.    a deraxt(e) marbin ‘don’t cut that tree’
Note:
   Notice that in Xiaraji when a similar object is animate, it takes an oblique demon¬
strative adjective, whereas when inanimate, it takes a direct demonstrative adjective,
e.g.
             Xia.    jem rayyate aziat maka ‘don’t bother this peasant'
                     ja misa mazan ‘don’t hit that ewe’
             but     em sang ugi ‘lift this stone’
                     a sang basin ‘throw that stone’(c) Indirect Object       .
157 The indirect object of an intransitive verb, when singular, is expres¬
sed in the direct case. Examples:
             Cha.     ah-i sang dyd ‘may you be frustrated (lit. may your sigh
                      come to stone)’
                      be barga ‘come to the court’
                      misu mellena ba:daza ma kid ‘he goes to the school, then
                      comes to the house’
             Tak.     besia Mesr ‘she went to Egypt’
             Esh.     misem Quma (f.) ‘I am going to Kum’
Xia.       Hasan beso cul ‘H. went to pasture’
             Ebr.     saba misoma sekar ‘tomorrow 1 go hunting
             Esf.     cul masa ‘don’t go to pasture’
In the case of transitive verbs it is not always easy to decide, when formal
distinctions are lacking, whether an object should be considered direct or
indirect. The ‘indirect’ objects of transitive verbs are generally followed
                                       NOUNS                                       101by a postposition or, rarely, preceded by a preposition, and are therefore
treated as the objects of pre- or postpositions (v. § 175 ff.). Such an object
without a pre- or postposition attached to it is not formally treated any
differently from a direct object.         Notice that the singular, inanimate
dative object of a transitive verb is put in the direct case, as would be a
similar accusative object,50 e.g.
           Cha.    bepperen deraxt ‘throw at the tree’
           Tak.    zarones borosta Siraz ‘he has sent his children to Shiraz’
           Ebr.    berasasta darnbar ‘she reached the house door’
           Sag.    mdsen difar ‘stick on the wall’
           Xoz.    ewa mariz zemin ‘don’t pour water on the ground’
The dative objects of such verbs as ‘to give’, ‘to say’, ‘to hit’, and ‘to
throw’, which are not followed as a rule by a postposition, generally
behave as direct objects, e.g.
           Tak.    qoc-e sang mazan ‘don’t throw stone at the ram’
           Esh.    alaf-e misa da ‘give the grass to the ewe’
Cf. § 156 6.(d) Logical Object    .
158 The logical object in a passive construction is generally treated as an
ordinary object except in Eshtehardi, where it is expressed in the direct
case (v. § 331 ff.). In Chali both cases are attested.","[84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"

marked differently. Other final vowels, including e, are to be assumed stressed unless
another vowel in the word is marked as stressed. Stress signs generally are omitted
when the stress may be gathered from definition or example, when it is absorbed in the
intonation, and also in Ssta ‘thee, thine’.
   In verbs the stress is generally to be gathered from the rules (v. § 84).
   The name of the dialects appears without diacritical marks in the body of the
Grammar, except in the headings, v. 18 for their fuller transcription.
   The vowels i, i, u and u, as commonly used by Orientalists, are rendered by e, i, o
and u.
   In ia and ua a glide between the two vowels (y and w, respectively) is implied.
   The Ramandi materials (v. p. 25) generally appear with an asterisk in transcription,
since with limited exceptions they are in unvocalized Persian script.

                             INTRODUCTION
By ‘Tati’ are meant the Iranian dialects spoken in northwestern Persia
(excepting Persian and Kurdish), in areas where the common vernacular
is Azerbaijani Turkish. The similarity between these dialects, spoken
sporadically in an area extending from the southern borders of the Aras
River to the north of Saveh, justifies a common appellation.1
  The exploration of Tati dialects is not yet complete, but the main areas
where Tati is spoken have now been identified.2 The Tati dialects may be
said to fall roughly into five groups:
   (1) dialects spoken to the southwest of Qazvin and in Eshtehard;
  (2) the dialect spoken in Xo’in, 60 kms. southwest of Zanjan, and in a
number of smaller villages mainly derived from Xo in (Balbavin, Sefid-
kamar, Halab, Sa'd-abad, etc.);3
  (3) dialects spoken in Khalkhal and Tarom;4
   (4) dialects spoken in Harzand and Dizmar;51 Technically speaking, Tati does not refer to any particular dialect or group of
dialects The word tat is generally used in the area to denote the Iraman-spea mg
peoples in the region (v. V. Minorsky in El, under ‘Tat’). The designation of these
dialects by ‘Tati’ follows this general and vague usage. Following a paper which 1
read to the 1st International Congress of Iranists (Tehran, 1966), I now propose to
call these dialects ‘Median’, a more appropriate appellation.
2 The Tati dialects of the Caucasus, which derived from Persian or a dialect similar
to it, do not really belong to this group.
3 The dialect is called di by its speaker.                                         _
4 This group of dialects has a wide range and may be roughly divided into two majo
groups: those which distinguish the feminine gender (Karam Karnaqi, Lerdi Dm,
 Kajali, and Gandomabi in Khalkhal, and Nowkiam-Siavarudi, H^zar'ru^’ Ja“a ‘
 abadi and Bakoluri in the Upper Tarom) and those which dotot do
 Sabui, Deravi, Koluri, Shali, Taharomi, Geylavam, Kahali in Khalkhal, and Kalasan,
 Shava’i and Charza’i in the Upper Tarom). The difference between some of these
 ‘d alec s’Ts minimal. They are often mutually intelligible and sometimes are no more
 than              one anolher. Only with this understanding the languag,, of^h
 village has generally been ealled a ‘dialect'-The D,a ect of Sharud (Khatth^,

18                                 INTRODUCTION     (5) dialects spoken to the east and northeast of Qazvin (in Kuhpayeh,
Rudbar and Alamut).
 Tati dialects constitute one of the most important branches of North-
Western Iranian. Their many remarkable grammatical features and their
many archaisms in morphology, syntax, and vocabulary invite special
attention, and their geographical position and their significance for a
reconstruction of the development of North Western Iranian call for
intensive study. Systematic investigation is required both to reveal those
Tati dialects which may as yet be unknown and also to clarify the details
of the known dialects, which are generally only imperfectly studied. The
present work is a step in this direction.
     The dialects studied here, and called Southern Tati, are the following:
                                    Chali
                                    Takestani
                                    Eshtehardi
                                    Xiaraji
                                    Ebrahim-abadi
                                    Sagz-abadi
                                    Danesfani
                                    Esfarvarini
                                    Xoznini6
The name of each dialect is taken from the main village in which the
dialect is spoken.7 All these villages are situated to the southwest and
south of Qazvin, chiefly in the rural district8 of Ramand, which lies at
the foot of the Ramand Mountains (v. map).","[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"
"Note:
  Since the logical direct object is very often followed by a suffix pronoun, it is not
always possible to ascertain the ending of such an object, when singular.a) Examples in the oblique:
       Cha. arusia mardemd... jibardrd ‘they gathered the people
                   (pi.) of the wedding’
                   Sah Ebrahimes zanar bard ‘Shah E. brought the wife’
           Tak.    ja gandeme bardem ‘I carried that wheat’
                   Hasane zanar ra da vindem ‘I saw H.’s wife on the road’
           Esf.    bezon-es sar arbind ‘he slaughtered the goats’
b) Examples in the direct:
       Cha. do gave (pi.) -s ji bebard cul ‘and he took two cows to
                   pasture’ (v. § 110a)
            (cf.   dona gavon-es bebard cul ‘he took his two cows to
                   pasture’, a similar context in which, however, the logical
                   object is expressed in the oblique)
60 Note that S. Tati does not possess a genuine post- or preposition equivalent to
dative ‘to’.

 Further examples of objects grouped under each dialect heading will be
 found below; v. § 161 ff.(e) Object of Postpositions     .
 159 The object of a postposition is generally expressed in the oblique
case. However, when the postposition is a single vowel or begins with a
vowel, the oblique singular ending -e does not appear. Examples:
               Cha.   Hasan-e ra batem ‘I told H.’
                      razon-u ‘in the gardens’
                      asbon-a ci undi ‘give something to the horses’

               Dan.   Iuas-(e) ra gust adi ‘give meat to the fox’
               Esf.   Hasan-e ku uger ‘take [it] from H.’
         cf.   Cha.   jeya pay-u bese ‘he followed his footsteps’ (lit. went in his

               Ebr.   ji zamin-afayda ni ‘there is no profit in this land’
               Sag.   zamin-a barow ‘pull out from the earth’
                                   6. The Genitive     .
160 The genitive, which precedes the noun it modifies, is generally ex¬
pressed in all the dialects in the oblique case, e.g.61   a is a shortened form of ra, which here follows the suffix pronoun -(e)s\ v. § 182.
                                       NOUNS                                  103             Cha.    deraxt-e laqa beskiasa ‘the tree’s branch is broken’
                     besian-e vaxte ‘it is time to go (lit. time of going)’
                     deh-e kadxoda-r pur52 ‘the son of the headman of the
                     village’
            Tak.     Ahmad-e galbar ‘Ahmad’s house-door’
             Esh.    kavalun deq da ‘from the seam[s] of the [canal] tiles’
             Xia.    deraxtun varga berenjesta ‘tree leaves (lit. leaf of the
                     trees) have fallen’
             Ebr.    qoc-e sax bege ‘take the ram’s horn’
             Dan.    luas-e pus vej ‘peel off the fox’s skin’
An enclitic pronoun may come between the genitive and the word it
modifies, e.g.
             Sag.    xacar-i das bejir ‘take your (sg.) sister’s hand’
In genitival compounds, however, the preceding member ends in -a.
In such compounds the stress of the first member is submerged in the
stress of the second. Examples:
             Cha.    daya teta ‘cousin (mother’s brother’s daughter)’
                     xoyya dassa ‘shovel handle’
                     Ramanda ku ‘the Mount Ramand’
                     Cala zon ‘the language of Chal’
             Esh.    bibia fur ‘cousin (father’s sister’s son)’
             Xia.    amia pevr ‘cousin (father’s brother’s son)’
V. § 162 a, n. 2., for further examples.","[103, 104, 105]"

                                     D. CASE
                               1. General Remarks
99. Among the Southern Tati dialects, Eshtehardi has a clear system of
two cases, direct and oblique. The distinction is extended in Eshtehardi
to both genders and numbers.
  This system, which may be assumed to have been the basic system of
Southern Tati,14 appears in other dialects of the group only in weaker
forms.    Farthest in this respect from Eshtehardi lie Takestani and
Danesfani, which distinguish the oblique case only in the masculine
singular.
   The other dialects generally have a position in between.                They all
distinguish the two cases in both singular and plural, but not in the
feminine.
  100. In all Southern Tati dialects an oblique case in -(a)r is employed
for a number of nouns denoting family relatives. This is a continua¬
tion of the older oblique ending of nouns originally ending in -tar. The
ending is extended in the majority of Southern Tati dialects (not, how-
13 Cf. also Cha. ambdri; Ebr., Sag. ambdri; but Tak. arimia; Esh. omberia (Zhukov¬
sky, Mat., II, 107b: onberia ‘pear’); -i- is, however, original here, from -u(d); cf.
Shandermani (Talesh) ambaru; Masulei amru\ Pers. amrud; Asalemi amb{u)ru
(suggested by W. B. Henning).
14 This assumption is also supported by the evidence of some closely related dialects
such as Nowkiani (in Upper Tarom), in which the same system is fully in force.
 74                                    MORPHOLOGY ever, in the peripheral Eshtehardi and Takestani) to genitives and direct
 objects denoting a person (v. § 134 ff.).
      101. All Southern Tati dialects make use of a number of postpositions
 which are sometimes hardly distinguishable from case endings, and
 create case-like forms (e.g. Cha. u; Tak., Ebr. a; Sag. d ‘in, from’).
 Their nature is revealed, however, by their appearing also after the
 oblique plural morpheme and the pronominal suffixes; v. § 175 ff.
   102. The ezafa construction, borrowed from Persian, is occasionally
 found in all the dialects; v. § 147.
    103. The scope of the function of the oblique case depends mainly on
 the case form employed for the agent in a ‘passive construction’.15 The
 use of the passive construction with the past tenses of the transitive verb
 can be discerned in all the dialects. The construction is found in almost
 full force in Eshtehardi, where the agent is expressed in the oblique, the
 logical direct object in the direct case, and the verb agrees in number
 and gender with its logical direct object, when animate. With inanimate
 objects, the concord of verb is generally abandoned, and the verb (in
 fact, the verbal adjective) appears in the masculine singular form.
   The most attenuated form of the passive construction is found in
Takestani, Xiaraji, Sagz-abadi, Danesfani, Esfarvarini, and Xoznini,
where the agent appears in the direct case and the logical direct object is
treated as the grammatical direct object, as if it were used with a present
transitive verb. Chali and Ebrahim-abadi have a middle position.                        In
Chali the agent is expressed in the oblique case; in Ebrahim-abadi it is
expressed mostly in the oblique case, but also frequently in the direct
case (v. §§ 153, 161 ff.).","[75, 76]"
"Examples (from ‘to be’ and ‘to become’):
          Cha.     vastemon balad ne-bend ‘they were not skilled in dancing’
                   ava sia-ranga bia ‘the water (f.) was black-colored’
                   biago bes ‘where were you?’
          Tak.     aseq a-ve ‘he became enamored’
          Esh.     a cupun bu ‘he was [a] shepherd’
                  suamina bajia-s hama da xordek-tara bia ‘his third sister
                  was smallest of all’

                  something lagging, I would kill you’

              Sag.      pa me-be ‘he used to get up (lit. to be [on] foot)’Note:
  In Eshtehardi, along with mi-bu\em-bu ‘he was, he became’, mi-bia/em-bia ‘she was,
she became’ (v. §§ 292; 360, n. 2), there occurs a parallel form, em-bust/mi-bust (m.)
and em-busta/mi-busta13i (f.), e.g.
          Esh. miajenda ke Nasereddin-sa harvaqt bipul embust ‘they say that when¬
                 ever N. Shah became penniless’

Notes:
   1. The difference between the perfect and the preterit in Takestin, Eshtehardi, and
Sagz-abadi is clear in the 3rd person singular, but not quite so clear in the other persons
(cf. § 316, n.; 355, n. 2). Some of my informants regarded a final -a/-e in persons other
than the third as marking the perfect, e.g. Tak. veyma against veym (cf. § 317, n. 2, 3),
but the appearance of the euphonic -a/-e in some preterit forms made this doubtful.
Some other informants did not seem to make the distinction.
   2. In Danesfani v- came close to w in the pronunciation of my informants (cf.
§ 355, n. 4).
   3. In Ramandi, except in the 3rd person singular and 1st person plural, the perfect
differs from the preterit in having the affix be-: *beveyma, *beveysa, *bevi, *beveyun,
*beveya, 65, 66, 74. (The 3rd person plural does not occur in the Resala.)
133 For Ramandi forms, v. the Resala, 65.
134 Here probably belongs also -mi-best in Esf. pa-m{i)-best, ‘he used to be up (lit.
he used to be [on] foot)’.
135 In the paradigm of the perfect, the final -afe's, which appear to be euphonic (v.
§ 298), are registered as given by the informants. Since these forms occur only infre¬
quently in the texts, it has not been possible, except in a few cases, to decide with cer¬
tainty whether the use of -a/-e is optional (v. § 317, n. 2, 3) or an integral part of the
formation of the perfect.

 A subjunctive perfect of the substantive verb, made of the participle and
 the subjunctive of this verb, occurs as the auxiliary of the subjunctive
 pluperfect in Chali; v. § 328.
   For a conditional (?) past of the substantive verb in Xiaraji, v. § 330.g) Pluperfect358. a) The common pluperfect (v. § 322) is formed from the past parti¬
ciple and the preterit of the substantive verb.     The preterit generally
follows the participle. In Sagz-abadi, however, the endings are generally
attached to the first member. (F. § 325.)
   Examples (from ‘to be’ and ‘to become’):
          Cha.    az raz-u bia bim ‘I had been in the garden’
                  anda ke pir d-bia bu ‘so old he had become [that]’

Cf. the following Sagz-abadi paradigm, ‘I had become old’, etc.:
         sg. 1. pir a-vem be           pi. 1. pir a-veymun be
             2. pir a-ves be               2. pir a-veya be
             3. pir a-va-v                 3. pir a-vend be
Regarding the first element as the participle and the second as the 3rd
person singular of the preterit is based on analogy with the intransitive
pluperfect (v. § 325) and on the 3rd person singular va-v, above (v. § 355,
n. 5). Cf. Sag. besaym be, beseys be, besia-v, besaymon be, besayd be
I had gone , etc. (of the Qala District). The following two variants of the
1st person singular (of the same sub-dialect) confirm the point: besiam be,
besia bem ‘I had gone’.

359. The present of ‘to become’ is conjugated as follows (cf. §§ 302, 352):
                  Tak.                Xia.             Ebr.

                     becomes)’

‘to be’ (v. §§ 346, 353 ff.). Examples from verbal conjugations and verbal
nouns:

           Sag.      xarab a-va-v ‘it had become ruined’
Notes:
  1. The fact that the a- which precedes the base of ‘to become’ is not a suffix of the
verb s nominal complement may be seen from the following example, where a- is
separated from the nominal element by the prefix b(e)- :
          Xia. Hasanepevra ce b-a-bep. ‘what became of H.’s son?’
and the following, where the verb, being used in the sense of ‘to be possible’, has no
nominal complement:
          Xoz.     em kar avi pul a-ne-m-be ‘this business will not be [possible] without
                 money’
  2. In Eshtehardi the preverb u is used instead of a, e.g.
          Esh. bidar u-bem ‘I became awake’
                  saf u-bi ‘[that] it become purified’
Occasionally u- is omitted, e.g.
          Esh. harvaqt mariza em-bia ‘whenever she became ill’ (v. § 292)
                 sali do kas tiaxoS em-bu ‘he used to become sick twice a year’
                  dir ba-bu ‘it had become late’
  3. In Chali, when the word preceding the a- of ‘to become’ ends in -d, the two vowels
combine in -6-, e.g.
          Cha. xasso-bin (< xassd a-biti) ‘to become tired’
                 pild-bin (< pila a-bin) ‘to grow big, to grow’
                       2. Compound Verbs with ‘to make’
361. In compound verbs made with the verb ‘to make’ (Cha., Tak., Esf.
yar-; the other dialects kar-) and a nominal element, a particle a precedes
                                       VERBS                                267the verbal element (examples from Cha., Xia., Ebr., Sag., and Dan; in
Takestani the particle is a). The particle is best treated as a preverb,
similar to the one preceding the verbal base of ‘to become’, (v. § 360, n. 1),
even though a-kar-/a-yar- by itself means ‘to open’. Notice the following
example, in which the agent pronoun i comes between the nominal
element and -a:
         Cha. dir-i a-yard ‘you (sg.) were late (lit. you made late)’
Examples:
        Cha.      pak a-yar ‘make clean!’
                   nus a-yar a ‘enjoy ye [it]!’
                   gus a-yard ‘listen ye!’138
                   sur a-yarden ‘to paint red’
                   xamus a-yarden ‘to extinguish’
                   xolla-yar ‘bend!’
(contrast: tan yarom ‘[that] we put on, dress’)
           Tak.    xamus a-yardan ‘to extinguish’
                   gerd a-yardan ‘to collect’
                   gus a-yardan ‘to listen’
           Xia.    vejin a-me-karem ‘I am weeding’
           Ebr.    gus a-kardan ‘to listen’
           Sag.    araq a-karda buma ‘he came sweating (lit. [having] made
                   sweat)’
           Dan.    rowsan a-ka ‘kindle!’
                             3. ‘must’, ‘will’, ‘want to’      .
362 a) ‘must’ has an impersonal and indeclinable form: Cha. migo,
Tak., Esf. mogo, Esh. migu,Xia. mega,139 Ebr. megow, Sag. mejow,U2Xoz.
megow, from the base *gav- ‘to need, to want’. The tense and the person
is indicated in the verb that follows ‘must’, e.g.
          Cha. zoma migo ... bard hammom ‘you must take the bride¬
                   groom to the bathhouse’
                   az migo cenavyarom ‘what must I do (lit. how must I do)?
                   az migo aber-arom ‘I must uproot [it]
                   migo cemen bera be ‘my brother must come
                   ta bas ta binom az migo ci yarom ‘you stay until I see
                   what I must do’
138   Cf. Persian gus kardan ‘to listen’.
139   This occurs in a sole example; v. below. One expects megow, which occurs in
Ramandi, 65 ff.
 268                                   MORPHOLOGY              Tak.     mogo besey ‘you (sg.) must go’
              Esh.     az migu besem ‘I must go’
                       migu buaza ‘he must run’
              Xia.    aru miga besem ‘today I must go’
              Sag.    mejow bexoram ‘we must eat’
                      mejow berxinem ‘I must buy’
                      home mejow Hasane balad avan ‘[we] must all learn from
                      Hasan’
              Xoz.    ja nune megow boxoras ‘you (sg.) must eat from that
                       bread’
 b) The word for must, when followed by the subjunctive present, may
 also serve to indicate a sense of the future tense: an action or state that
 the subject must or wants to bring about, e.g.
              Cha.    migo besom, migo besas, migo besi, etc. ‘I will, must,
                      want to go; you will, must, want to go’, etc.
              Tak.    mogo besem, mogo besey, etc. ‘I will, must, want to go,
                      you will, must, want to go’, etc.
         Esf.   mogo besi ‘he wants to go’
Cf. the negative:
              Cha.    az me-ne-go besom, Tak. a me-ne-go besem ‘I don’t want
                      to go; I don’t intend to go’
Cf. Ram. 65 flf. where the Persian auxiliary of the future, xaham, xahi, etc.,
is rendered by *megow, *megow bem, *megow bas, *megow bi, *mego
bun, *megow ba, *megow binda ‘I will be, you will be’, etc.
      c) As an ordinary verb, Cha. gdli0-/gavas-, Tak. go-/gost-, Esh. gu-/gust-,
Xia. gow-lgowast-, Ebr. gow-jgowast-, Sag. jow-/jowast-, Xoz. gow/-
gowast- means to want, to intend, to desire’. The conjugation of this
verb, however, shows some peculiarities.
      The chief peculiarity is that in the present tenses it is conjugated like the
past tenses of a transitive verb,141 i.e., it does not take the present endings
(except when it is attracted to the intransitive conjugation, v. § 302) and
its subject is expressed not in the direct, but in the oblique case, often by
an enclitic agent pronoun (v. § 222, c). In Chali, if the subject is an in¬
dependent pronoun, it is generally an agential one (v. § 218). Occasional¬
ly, the subject is indicated only by the context.
  In past tenses the conjugation of this verb follows the general pattern
of that of transitive verbs (v. § 334 ff.). Examples:
140    If attracted to intransitive conjugations, the present stem will be gov-; V. below
141    These comments are based mainly on Cha., Tak., and Ram. material. ’

         Xoz. Zeynaba ku gowast-es ‘he demanded from Z’
Note:
  The examples available in Eshtehardi are not sufficient to make the situation clear in
that dialect, -m in the following examples is probably to be taken as the agent pronoun:
             Esh. migua-m besem xarmen bekuem ‘I want to go to thresh the harvest’
                   migua-m sa:r da bebarem ba.rusem ‘I want to carry [it] to town to
                   sell’
142 Many of the forms of this verb and their translation, which appear in the Resala,
are corrupt.
                       VI. SOME CONJUNCTIONS*
363. Some copulative conjunctions deserve mention. For the associative
conjunction ‘and’ the dialects generally use e or o.
   a) Chali uses e, ye, and less frequently o. In Chali e combines with a
preceding -a or -a in 6. o is apparently borrowed from Persian and is used
only infrequently, ye is employed most frequently after a vowel. If the
preceding vowel is -a or -a, it changes into 6 before ye. With nouns ending
in a consonant, ye is occasionally preceded by a connective -e- or -/-.
           Cha.   gav o xar o mis ‘cow and donkey and ewe’
                  sdz e zerna (also saz{e)-ye zerna) ‘with [musical] instru¬
                  ment and zerna
                  vast e vaz-u ‘with dance and play’
                  das e pa ‘hand and foot’
                  nun e panir ‘bread and cheese’
                  qand e cai ‘sugar and tea’
                  cerd ye miz ‘lamp (eera) and table’
                  az e ta (also az ye ta) ‘I and you (sg.)’
                  to ye az ‘you (sg.) and I’
                  az e a‘I and he’
                  6 ye az ‘he and I’
                  az e aya ‘I and she’
                  ayo ye az ‘she and I’
                  Hasan-i ye AH ‘Hasan and Ali’
                  Zeynabd ye Zivdra bdrnind ‘Zeynaba and Zivara (both f.)

                  Zivaro ye Zeynaba ‘Zivara and Zeynaba’
                  gav ye xara ‘cattle and donkey’
                  osdor ye qatera ‘camel and mule’
                  dsdord ye qatera ‘female camel {osdora) and mule’    Of the particles, only some conjunctions are mentioned. For postpositions, v.
§ 175ff. For prepositions, v. § 202. For preverbs, v. § 263ff.
                               SOME CONJUNCTIONS                                 271                   zomo ye zoma-bera ‘the bridegroom and the bridegroom’s
                   brother’
                   cuputi e varziar e darvis ca katend ‘the shepherd and the
                   peasant and the dervish fell into the pit’
                   asb e miso beza besenda ‘the horse and the ewe (misa) and
                   the goat went’
                   pid mdyd vayo zome mabeyn-u da:va gardas (-6 < -a + e)
                   ‘dispute arose among the father and mother and the
                   daughter-in-law and the son-in-law’
Note:
   Re3a’i thought ye could not be used instead of e in dus e dosman-e mon-u ‘among
friend and foe’, which might be thought to indicate the basic meaning of ye as ‘with,
together’; but the following example contradicts such an assumption:
           Cha. ara bar ye as bepej ‘turn the hand-mill and cook as’
Occasionally e was rounded, e.g.
            Cha. zand post-u e qaberqdn-u cena bu miarend ‘how they sniff from
                  the behind and the sides of women!’
                   mikasom ah e zari ‘I suffer sights] and wailing’
In the two following instances yu instead of ye was noted:
            Cha. luas-e-yu xers done bekatenda ca ‘the fox and the bear both fell into
                   the pit’
                   Hasan e Hosein-e-yu Ali bomend ‘Hasan and Hosein and Ali came’1b) In Takestani e and yon (ion2 after a consonant) are used. Examples of
                   yon/ion:
           Tak.    qoc ion beza-m bord ‘I brought the ram and the goat’
                   asifa yon aleva-m bord ‘I brought apple[s] and plum[s]’
                   gandem ion yo ‘wheat and barley’
c) Examples of o from Sagz-abadi;
       Sag.    vis duna sisak o ojaj-es da ‘he had twenty sisak and ojaj
                   (two-year-old and three-year-old male sheep, respec¬
                   tively)’
                   bila-s mujerat o meso pey car-es ‘he would pick up his
                   spade and go after his job’
                   canduna bilo (/'.<?., bila + o) xuyya ‘a few spade[s] and
               shovel[s]’
364. In Takestani and Eshtehardi the adverbial conjunction da is used
in the sense of ‘and, also, too’, and also sometimes superfluously (cf. the
postposition -da, § 176 ff.). Examples:
         Tak. bera-m da cemen bi buma ve ‘my brother too had come
                   with me’
1 When closely questioned, however, Ameli considered yu wrong and ye correct.
The -u in yu may be a strongly rounded allophone of -e (?).
2 -n in both forms has a weak articulation.

                     one side, they are coming’
                    ji kar-es da bia ‘he performed also this work’
                     Elyas da can sini sarab borce ‘and Elyas brought several
                     trays of wine’
             Esh.    berar-es da buat ‘and his brother said’
    365. (h)ani ‘also, too, again’ was attested in most of the dialects. Examples:
             Cha.    beparrasa qus hani das mend ‘[a] bird [which has] flown
                     will not come to hand again’
             Xia.    i-ani bera-s ‘and one brother of his (another brother of
                     his)’
                     do-ani asb da ‘he had also two horses’
             Ebr.    i-ani ‘and one, also one, another’
             Sag.    do-ani xaka-s da ‘he also had two sisters’
                     hani esta palev powjar nemiarem ‘I will not bring shoes
                     again to you’
                    i-ani bera-s meso madrasa ‘and one brother of his used to
                    go to school’
                    izani (i.e., iza-ani) ‘and a little, a little too’
366. je ‘also, too, and’ (Pers. ham).3 The final vowel seems to have a wide
range, from i to a. Examples:
             Cha.   maya-je-s salporontar-u bemardi bia ‘and his mother had
                    died three years earlier’
                    jay-je-ra ‘for him too’
                    jaya-je-ra ‘for her, too’
                    emi-je ‘these, too’ (erne ‘these’; v. § 27)
             Xia.   doa-je-s magowa-s da ‘he had also two cows’
When a consonant preceeds je, an intrusive e, often patalized into
intervenes, e.g.
             Xia.   nun-iji debanda ‘also bake ye bread’
                    gonah-ije-m baxsanda sab bef ‘and the night was the
                    forgiver of my sin[s]3    Cf. the following compound verbs, where ji may be rendered by the Persian ham:
             Cha. ji-zanden ‘to stir’, Pers. (be-)ham-zadan
                   ji-aSinden ‘to fit together’, Pers. be-ham-andaxtan
                   ji-dmin ‘to become confused, deranged or cancelled’, Pers. be-ham-
                    xordan
                                SOME CONJUNCTIONS                                  273In some cases, however, when the word preceding je ends in a vowel, the
intervening -e-/-i- is hard to explain:
           Cha.      gelakareja (i.e., gelakdra ija; v. § 28) ‘the mud-worker
                     (f.),4 too’
                     ruaza-r-ijom ‘my grandson, too’ (v. § 76 for -r- and § 81, c
                     for o)
           Sag.      esta-r-ija (i.e., -ij(a) + a < ra ‘for you, too’5
In such cases -i- may represent an extension of the intrusive vowel, or
else it may be the conjunction i (v. below) combining with je (?).
    367. i (-j after a vowel) ‘too, also’ is similar to the preceding conjunc¬
tion in meaning. In Chali it combines with a preceding a or a into e
(v. § 81, a), e.g.
           Cha.      te (< ta -f- i) be ‘you (sg.) too, come!’
                     az-i a:ra migo besom sa:r ‘I, too, want to go to town
                     tomorrow’
                     qanatdn-i ubandem ‘and I fix the qanats
           Tak.      av-i da mume and ‘he comes, too’
                     ta-y da biru ‘and you, too, come!’
           Xia.      ceme-y bebar ‘take me along, too!’Note:
 According to Ameli, the use of i or (i)ja in certain combinations is fixed by usage and
may not be changed, e.g.
                ame ‘we, too’ (i.e., ama + 0
          but, eja ‘she, too’ (from dya (i) jal)
4   Plastering the walls of a house with mud is a woman’s job in Tati-speaking villages,
v. §. p. 116.
6 V. § 182 for (r)a ‘for’. One would expect ra, since -a normally is used after con¬
sonants.
                                   VII. SUFFIXES*
    368. The following noun-forming suffixes occur:1
    a) a (stressed), in abstract nouns from verbs, e.g.
             Cha.    berma ‘weeping’ (Persian gerya)
                     fapa ‘palpitation’2
    b) ci, in abstract nouns from adjectives, e.g.
             Esh.    tarika ‘darkness’
                     xonaka ‘the cold, coolness’
         Cf. Cha. jora ‘upward, the upper side’
               jara ‘downward, the lower side’
c) ak/aka (m. and f.), in diminutives, e.g.
             Esh.   furiak ‘little boy’
                     tetiaka ‘little girl’
                     lapetaka ‘doll’
d) andon (Chali), endun (Eshtehardi), in nouns denoting location or a
container, e.g.
             Cha.   dizandon ‘pot holder, i.e., a triangular iron rack placed
                    on the oven on which pot(s) (dizi) may be placed’
                    cilakandon, sangandon ‘gizzard’
                    izemandon ‘fuel-bin’
             Esh.   ezqalendun ‘place or container of charcoal’
                  dizendun ‘pot holder’ (v. above)
e) (<e)st, in nouns from adjectives, e.g.
             Ebr.   cowrest ‘fat, grease’ (cowr ‘greasy’)
/) akin3 ‘pertaining to’, in abstract nouns from nouns, e.g.
             Esh.   lapetakin ‘playing with dolls’
                    qapakin playing          with     knuckle-bones;        games     with
                    knuckle-bones’
Cf. the suffix -kin in Chali possessive pronouns, § 227.
*   For adjectival suffixes, v. §§ 203, 208, 210; for suffixes of verbal nouns, v. § 343 ff.
   The available material is not sufficient to determine the distribution of these
suffixes among the dialects, nor to decide which is no longer productive.
2 ziva ‘living, furniture’ was, however, given with an unstressed -a.
3 This may in fact consist of two suffixes: -ak (v. c, above) and -in (cf. §208, b).

"19   On formal grounds, the distinction between the preverbs (§ 267) and words such as
aber and ji which do not seem to occur separately is hard to draw. The meaning of ji
(together) and aber (up, out), however, is clear to the speakers of the dialect, and their
use hardly idiomatic. In drawing the line I have followed the clear distinction made by
Ameli.
20 Cf. some Ebr. and Sag. examples from A. A. word lists:
       Ebr. jir-a-karden, Sag. jir-d-cardan (147) ‘to bury’;
       Ebr., Sag. sabr-owardan (153) ‘to sneeze’; vir-a-bar-sian (154) ‘to become for¬
       gotten’ (cf. Pers. az ydd raft an);
       Ebr. lia-kardan (157) ‘to open’;
       Sag. bubu-card-van, Ebr. lasa-fen (158) ‘to become rotten, stinking’;
       Sag. sar-be-dan (162) ‘to let free, to let go’.
                                      VERBS                                    193                  D. DISTINCTION OF GENDER IN VERBS                                    1. General269. A remarkable feature of Southern Takestani is its marking of gender
in verbs. All the dialects distinguish the gender in the 3rd person singular
of the preterit and the imperfect, and all but Sagz-abadi do the same in
the perfect and the pluperfect of intransitive verbs.             There is more
divergence among the dialects in the present and the subjunctive in this
respect.
  The basic pattern of gender distinction may be seen in Eshtehardi (v.
below, § 378) which distinguishes the gender in the preterit, imperfect,
perfect, and pluperfect, i.e., all tenses built on the past stem (originally
a verbal adjective), and also in the singular present of the substantive
verb, but otherwise not in tenses built on the present stem.
  In the other dialects, by extension, some tenses built on the present
stem also show the gender: all but Eshtehardi and Esfarvarini distinguish
the gender in the present. Takestani marks the distinction even in the
3rd. person singular of the subjunctive.21
  Xiaraji, Danesfani, and Xoznini, on the other hand, do not distinguish
the gender in the copula, a distinction which is dying out in Esfarvarini
also.
   Sagz-abadi, contrary to expectation, makes no distinction of gender
in the perfect or pluperfect (v. § 281, d).
  The distinction in the 1st and 2nd persons singular, when it occurs at
all, seems to be rare.22
   Past transitive verbs, which are governed by the passive construction,
do not mark the gender, except in Eshtehardi. Their concord in gender
in this dialect is, however, not with the logical subject, but with the logical
direct object (v. below, § 278, and § 331 IT).
   The manner of marking the gender in verbs is basically the same as in
nouns, i.e., the feminine form ends in an unstressed -a when the masculine
form ends in a consonant, and in -ia when the masculine form ends in
-a/-e (v. §§ 92, 98). The forms of the perfect and of the present of the
substantive verb may, however, be considered special cases (v. below,
and § 346 ff.).
21 V. below, § 281, c, for the possibility of the same distinction in Sagz-abadi.
22 It should be noted that feminine forms in the 1st and 2nd persons singular have
sometimes been elicited in contexts made up for that purpose, or else in paradigms,
which lack the naturalness of the contexts produced by the informants themselves.
It is therefore not impossible that occasionally a rare form may appear as a regular
form.
 194                                 MORPHOLOGY   270. The basic pattern of gender distinction in verbs is exemplified in
 the preterit and the imperfect:
           Cha. bettajasl-a ‘he/she ran’
                  mittajasl-a ‘he/she used to run’
          Tak. verit/-a ‘he/she ran’
                  mevrit/-a ‘he/she used to run’
          Esh. buastl-a ‘he/she ran’
          Xia. besut/-a ‘he/she [was] burned’
          Sag. mivast/-a ‘he/she used to run’
          Ebr. beflfa ‘he/she was’
          Tak. bomalbomia ‘he/she came’
          Esh. bezdjbezia ‘he/she beat’23
Where the 1st and 2nd persons singular distinguish the gender, the same
pattern is followed (v. § 81, d), e.g.
          Cha. bettat-im/bettat-em ‘I ran (m., f.)’
                 bettat-islbettat-es ‘thou ranst (m., f.)’
          Ebr. bevast-im/bevast-em ‘I ran (m., f.)’ (v. § 60)
The verbs ending in 6 or u from a base in original -v also have their
feminine form in -a or -ia, e.g.
          Cha., Tak., Xia. besolbesia ‘he/she went’
          Tak., Dan. misu/misu(y)a ‘he/she goes’
          Tak. besujbesu{y)a ‘[that] he/she goes’
The preterit and the imperfect of ‘to be’, which fall into this category,
show great variety, but do not deviate conspicuously from the basic
pattern, e.g.
           Cha., Esh. hu/bia ‘he/she was’
           Tak. ve/via
           Xia., Ebr. beflfa2i
           Sag. be(v)/va
           Dan. vu/vua
           Esf.   bii/ba
           Xoz. befjva
111. In the 3rd person singular perfect the general pattern of gender
distinction, except in Takestani, is for the masculine to end in -a(y)/-e(y)
(Cha. and Ebr. -e, v. §§ 28, 60), and the feminine in a stressed -i. Takestani
endings are -/ (m.) and -id (f.).25 Examples:S3 These occur in a passive construction: Hasane asb-eS beza / beza-s bezia ‘Hasan
beat his horse (m.) / beat his goat (f.)’.
24 In Xia., Ebr., Sag. and Xoz. ev (or ef) < u is a general phonological rule: v. p. 23.
26 V. § 316 ff. for details.
                                         VERBS                                       195           Cha.     berasase/berasasi ‘he/she has arrived5
                    besilbesi ‘he/she has gone’
           Tak.     veriti/vertid ‘he/she has run’
                    dxutilaxutid ‘he/she has slept (is asleep)’
                    berbanasti/berbanastid ‘he/she has cried’
           Esh.     berenjesta/berenjesti ‘it (m./f.) has been spilled’
           Xia.     bekatayjbekati ‘he has fallen’
                    besidy/besi ‘he/she has gone’
           Ebr.     vastd/vasti ‘he/she has run’
                    besie/besii ‘he/she has run’
           Dan.     vie/yii ‘he/she has been’
           Xoz.     bevastey/bevasti ‘he/she has run’
                    besiey/besi ‘he/she has gone’
272. In the pluperfect (v. § 321 ff.) one may discern two patterns:
   a) Only the auxiliary shows the gender (Tak., Xia., Esf., Xoz.), e.g.
           Tak.     berasasta26 ve/via ‘he/she had arrived’
           Xia.     besia-f / besia fa ‘he/she had gone’
           Esf.     besia bu / ba ‘he/she had gone’
           Xoz.     bumid-f / bumia va ‘he/she had come’
b) Both elements mark the gender, with the participle having -a in the
masculine and -i in the feminine (Cha., Ebr., Dan.), e.g.
           Cha.     berasasa bu / berasasi bia ‘he/she had arrived’
           Ebr.     bekata-f / bekatifa ‘he/she had fallen’
           Dan.     bevastow27/bevasti vu ‘he/she had run’
Eshtehardi follows the above pattern except that the participle has the
form of the 3rd person singular of the preterit (v. § 270).
           Esh.     buast bu / buasta bia ‘he/she had run’
                   gahast bu / gahasta bia ‘he/she had become’28
273. In the present and the subjunctive, whenever the gender distinction
is made, the norm is -e for the masculine and -ia for the feminine.29
           Tak.     mivrijelmivrijia ‘he/she runs’
                    biare/biaria ‘that he/she does’
           Xia., Dan.      mettaje/mettajia ‘he/she runs’
           Ebr.     mevaze/mevazia ‘he/she runs’
When the masculine form ends in -a, a j-glide precedes the feminine
morpheme, e.g.
26 -a alternates with -e.
27 -ow < *-a-v, v. § 355, n. 4.
28 Sagz-abadi does not mark the gender in the pluperfect.
29 Phonologically one might say that the -e, when followed by -a, is palatalized into -i-
(possibly through a connective y-glide). Hence -ej-ia.
 196                                  MORPHOLOGY            Tak.     ma/mdya ‘he/she comes’
            Xia., Xoz.       mid/midya ‘he/she comes’
 274. The copula exhibits a variety of forms in the feminine not readily
 explainable by the above general rule of thumb. In some of the dialects
 (Xia., Dan., Xoz.) the distinction of gender is lost and -e serves as copula
 for both the masculine and feminine.
    In the other dialects, it seems that the feminine form represents - at
 least in the majority of the cases - a combination of the feminine morphe¬
me -a and the copula for the masculine (v. §§ 28, 60, 81, 6; 116, a):
            Cha.    -ej-e ‘is’ (masc. and fern.)
            Tak.    -e/-a
            Esh.    -a/-i

                                    PREFACE
The work presented here is a descriptive grammatical sketch of nine
closely related Iranian dialects spoken in Ramand and some of its
neighbouring regions, all of them to the southwest and south of Qazvin.
The majority of these dialects are recorded or treated here for the first
time.   Together with the Northern Tati group, spoken mainly in the
southeast corner of Persian Azerbaijan, they constitute an important
branch of North Western Iranian.
  I owe my initial interest in Tati dialects to Professor W. B. Henning,
who made a brief visit to Takestan in 1950, realized the significance of
its dialect, and discussed it in a paper read to the London Philological
Society in 1953.1
  The dialect materials which served as the basis of this work were
collected in the course of several intermittent short trips between 1955
and 19632 to the Tati-speaking villages. My studies were facilitated by
the generous help I received from the Persian authorities.                    I owe a
particular debt of gratitude to His Excellency A. A. Alam, now the
President of Pahlavi University at Shiraz, for his liberal assistance
throughout these years. My thanks are also due to Mr. I. Yar-Afshar,
a gentleman farmer of Ramand and now a senator from Qazvin, for the
many facilities he kindly afforded me within the area.
 I am deeply indebted to Professor W. B. Henning, my respected
teacher, for his continued interest as well as his many helpful criticisms1 “The Ancient Language of Azerbaijan”, Trans. Philol. Soc., 1954.
2 The latest of these trips to the Tati-speaking regions was made possible through a
grant from the Council for Research in the Humanities, Columbia University, the
American Council of Learned Societies, to both of which I am grateful. My thanks are
also due to the Social Science Research Center and The American Philosophical Society
whose aid enabled me to make a more thorough search for the unrecorded varieties of
Tati in 1964 (of which the results will be published later).       _
  A treatment of the materials collected during my earliest trips on Takestani, Chali and
Eshtehardi served as my dissertation for the degree of Ph.D., University of London,
1960.
8                                PREFACEand suggestions in the course of this study. I am also grateful to Dr. Ilya
Gershevitch and Professor Sir Harold Bailey, both of Cambridge Univer¬
sity, for their remarks concerning the historical development of Southern
Tati, of which I hope to make use in the future. I am further thankful to
Professor R. Austerlitz of Columbia University and Professor A. Kuipers,
now of the University of Leiden, who discussed with me some relevant
phonological problems. Joseph Carter, M. A., my former student, kindly
read the chapter on phonology and made useful suggestions.
    It is also my pleasant duty to thank my many Tati informants for
their cooperation and helpfulness. In particular I should like to record
my thanks to Yadollah Sadeqi, my host and informant in Eshtehard,
Javad Taheri and ‘Aziz Rahmani of Takestan, the brothers Shah-Moham
madi of Chal, and the gifted and courteous cleric and poet, Bordbar
Ameli, of the same village.
    A list of my informants from different villages, to whom reference is
made in the body of the Grammar, appears on pp. 275-6.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"

‘one’, almost identical with Persian cardinals. Most of the dialects have a
feminine form for i ‘one’ (v. below, §212). In Xiaraji feminine forms
were attested also for numbers two and three.
  The cardinals in Chali, Eshtehardi, and Xiaraji are:12

b) The ordinals are modeled on Persian. Forms equivalent to Persian
ordinals in both -om and -om-in13 are used, the latter type being more
common (cf. § 208, b), e.g.
           Cha.    suamina mdh-u ‘in the third month’
                   suamina ruz ‘the third day’
           Esh.    suamina bdjia ‘the third sister’
           Xia.    avval xoda, duyyum xoda, suyyum xoda, cuarem xoda
                   ‘first [in the name of] God, second, etc.’
c) The following fractions occured in Xiaraji:
           Xia.    nima ‘half’, sd-kutu ‘a third’, car-yek ‘a fourth’, da:-yek
                   ‘a tenth’
For the concord of the numbered with numerals higher than one, v. § 110a.
  211. In Chali, according to Ameli, when a numeral expresses the total
number of the numbered, the numeral is followed by the suffix -ona, e.g.
           Cha.    sadond cuare-s bemardenda ‘his hundred sheep died
                        (which were all he had)’
                   dona15 gavon-es bebard cul ‘he took his two cows to
                        pasture’
               cf. galle-s-u sad care bemardend ‘a hundred sheep died from
                        his flock’
212. Of the numerals, a feminine form occurs for i, ‘one’, in Chali,
Eshtehardi, Xiaraji, Sagz-abadi, and Xoznini: Cha. ya; Esh., Xia., Sag.,
Xoz. ia. In Sagz-abadi and Xoznini, however, ia is attested only when
used as an indefinite pronoun. Cf. § 88. Examples:
           Cha.    ya zania ni-marzi ‘you don’t leave a [single] woman
                   [alive]’
                   ya quti var-u ‘[with] a box (f.) in [his] arms’
                   ya bura dard ‘he had a mare’
                   pure migo ya teti bexwazi ‘the boy wants to marry a girl’
           Esh.    ia zenia bia ‘there was a woman’
                   iasal(a) ia sala nim ‘[about] a year (f.), a year [and a] half’13 -in is a very common adjectival suffix; v. § 208, b.
14 The expression is apparently derived from the farming practice of dividing the
grain harvest in several equal piles (kut) for the purpose of sharing them out to the
landlord and the farmer. Cf. Esh. gandeme car-kud mi-kerun, i kut-es ra:yatia, so
kut-es arbabia ‘we make the wheat in four piles, one pile is for the farmer, three piles
for the landlord’.
15 I. e., do + ona.

                   (cf. berarun-es-an i-es besiaf Tehran ‘and of his brothers one
                       had gone to Tehran’)
             Sag.      xaca-sun (sic.) ia-s sev-es kardaf ‘of their sister[s], one

                       i (adj.) dada-s ‘one sister of his’)
Notes:
   1. The use of the feminine form of i, however, is not consistent in any of the dialects
and often i is used instead, e.g.
            Cha. i ruza sobi zii ‘one day (f.) early morning’
                   i xuaka-ni pajar para bia bi ‘and one sister’s shoe had been tom’
            Esh.   i zenia miay kardari ‘a woman is coming’
                   i xaka-s ‘one sister of his’
   2. I have only one example in Danesfani which seems to show the gender distinction:
            Dan. xokon-es-a ies set-es mexa ‘of his sisters one was a suckling’
           cf.     berarun-es-a i-sbuma parun ‘of his brothers one came forth’
  Not so in Esfarvarini:
            Esf.    xakon-es-a i-s bates ‘of his sisters one said’
                    i xaka-s batesa ‘one sister of his said’
   3. In Xiaraji do ‘two’, so ‘three’, and duna ‘a unit of countable objects,’ (Pers. darn,
originally ‘grain, seed’) also occasionally have a feminine form: dua, sua, and dunia,
respectively, e.g.
            Xia.can duna beza diri? iya, iya dunia, dua, sua ‘how many goats (f.) do
                you have? One, one head, two, three’
         (cf.   can duna qoc diri? i duna ‘how many rams do you have? One head’)
                dua-je magowa-s da ‘he also had two cows’
No feminine form is employed for numerals higher than three.","[145, 146, 147, 148]"

323. In Eshtehardi the past participle used in the pluperfect takes
participial morpheme and is the same as the past stem (as is the case also
in the perfect subjunctive, v. § 319). When such a participle ends in more
than one consonant, the last one may fall out in rapid speech, e.g.
                         buas(t) beym, buas(t) beys, buas(t) bu, etc.,
                         ‘I, you, he had run’
             but,        buasta bia ‘she had run’
324. In the Xiaraji pluperfect, the participle ends in -i except in the mascu¬
line 3rd person singular, which ends in -a, e.g.
                              bekati feyma       pi. 1.    bekati feymun
                              bekati feysa            2.   bekati feya
                              bekata-f                3. bekati feynda
                              bekati fa
94
      E.g., a bevastow < *bevasta-v ‘I had fled’.
                                        VERBS                                     233           Cf.     Hasan berasast a besifeyma ‘[when] Hasan arrived, I had
                   gone’
                   ta besi feysa ‘you had gone’
325. In Sagz-abadi the common pluperfect is formed by attaching the
ending of the preterit (v. § 313) to the participle, which is then followed by
be, the 3rd person singular preterit of the auxiliary. (Cf. § 320 for the
similar formation of the subjunctive perfect in this dialect.) For the re¬
duction of be in the 3rd person singular to -v/-f, v. § 322. Examples:
           Sag.    ta ce bumeys cema cia ama beseymun be ‘[when] you came
                   to our house, we had already left’
                   az ce bumeyma ta beseys be ‘[when] I came you (sg.) had
                   gone5
                   mejow berasas, az esta paruntara berasastem be ‘you
                   wanted to arrive, [but] I had arrived before you5
                   cema cappunar dost beskiastd-v ‘our shepherd’s hand had
                   broken5
                   dadd-sjmaya-s marda-v ‘his father/his mother had died5
                   az berasastim dada-m ndstai-s bexwarda be besia-v95
                   ‘[when] I arrived my father had eaten breakfast [and]
                   had gone5
b) Progressive Pluperfect (II)326. Examples of this occur in Chali and Eshtehardi. It differs from the
pluperfect I by employing the modal prefix mi- (§ 289), attached to the
auxiliary or the main verb in Chali and to the main verb in Eshtehardi,
e.g.
           Cha.    agar az miasta bima, agar az biasta mi-bima ‘if I had been
                   running5
           Esh.    a mi-vas(t) bu / a mi-vasta bia ‘he/she had been running5
(Cf. the same formation in transitive verbs:
          Cha. agar non-emo darda mi-bu ‘if we had been having bread5)
c) Quotational Pluperfect (III)327. This pluperfect is formed as the common pluperfect (§ 322) except
95 This example was elicited from Maleki. In his dialect the other forms were besaym
be, besays be, besaymon be, besaya be, besaynd be ‘I had gone’, etc. For the 1st person
singular, besia bem ‘I had gone’, which conforms to the pattern in the other dialects,
occurred once. Some other examples: bermamastem be’ ‘I had cried’, bekatem be ‘I
had fallen’. In i mardia jahandama bar umia, A. A., 97, ‘a man had come out of Hell,
one would expect umiav.
234                              MORPHOLOGY that it employs the perfect of the auxiliary (v. § 357) instead of the preterit.
Examples of it occur in Chali, Ebrahim-abadi and Danesfari, all in the
context of an indirect quotation:
           Cha.    Hasan maje nomia bia be ‘Hasan says he had not come’
           Ebr.    miajenda ta Hasane dada bemia ra Hasan uxota fe ‘they
                  say [that] before Hasan’s father came, Hasan had gone
                  to sleep’
                   miajenda ta Hasan berasasta ra dozd besia fe ‘they say
                  before Hasan arrived the thief had gone’
          Dan.    bevasta viey ‘he had fled’
The continuous form of the above is formed with the imperfective particle
me-/mi- (§ 289) attached to the participle, e.g.
          Ebr.    miajenda Hasan me-vasta fe- pa-s begerate sang
                  ‘they say Hasan had been running [when] his foot
                  stumbled over a stone’
                  Zeynaba me-vasti fi ‘Zeynaba (f.) had been running’
The following Sagz-abadi example seemingly has the same formation:
          Sag.    rdhd misia bavey (sic, for be-veyl Cf. § 357) ‘he had been
                  going on the road’
          (Cf.    xarab a-vey ‘it has become damaged’)d) Subjunctive Pluperfect (IV)328. This pluperfect is formed like the pluperfect I (§ 322), except that it
employs the subjunctive perfect of ‘to be’ as the auxiliary. Examples of it
were met only in Chali, in a conditional sense:
          Cha.    aga ta nomia bia bas az harfi ne dirom ‘if you should/have
                  not come, I [would] have nothing to say’
                  aga nomia bia bem axti ce majil ‘what [would] you say
                  if I should have not come?’e) Remote Pluperfect (V)329. This pluperfect employs the common pluperfect of ‘to be’ as auxi¬
liary. Examples of it were met in Chali, and also in Takestani transitive
verbs:
          Cha.    xoyyd ne-skiasa bia bu ‘the shovel had not been broken’
                  bomia bia bim, etc. ‘I had come’, etc.
      Cf. Tak.    dda va-vis ‘you (sg.) had given’
In Ebrahim-abadi an example occurs with the quotational pluperfect
(§ 327) of ‘to be’ as the auxiliary:

                    gone before Z.’s arriving’
                    ta Hasane berasasta ra Zeynaba (f.) besiifi fi ‘Z. had been
                    gone before H.’s arriving’
6) Conditional (?) Past and Pluperfect
  330. Examples occur in Xiaraji of a conditional past of the substantive
verb, e.g.
             Xia.   agar vir-em fid mevatem ‘if I had remembered I would
                    have told’
This form is used also in a pluperfect occurring in a conditional context:
             Xia.   agar bettati fia-ma berasasteyma ‘if I had run I would
                    have arrived’
               (cf. the same formation with the transitive verbs:
                    agar pevl-em gerd a-gerata fid meseyma Karbala ‘if I had
                    saved money I would go to K.’)96Note:
  To decide whether the fia forms may be used in a non-conditional sense needs further
investigation.
                                 b) Transitive Verbs1) The Passive Construction
  331. The formation of past transitive verbs is marked by a particular
construction, commonly called ‘the passive construction5, which is
discussed here in some detail.97
  The essential elements of a passive construction are: A) the agent, B) a
past transitive verb, and C) the logical direct object, e.g.
          Esh. gawd (A) alaf (C) bexard (B) ‘the cow (A) ate (B) the
                grass (C)5
Logically, the agent is the subject of the verb. Grammatically, however,
it does not stand in concord with the verb. The grammatical subject is the
logical direct object of the verb, since the verb is in fact built on a past
participle and has a passive sense.
  In a passive construction one would expect the agent expressed in the
oblique, the logical direct object in the direct case, and the verb (a verbal
adjective in fact) to agree in number and gender with the logical direct96 Cf. the transitive imperfect and common pluperfect in Xiaraji: agar midard-em ‘if I
had’, agar darda-m bef ‘if I had had’.
97 Cf. E. Benveniste, BSL, XLVIII, 1 (1952), where this type of construction is shown
to be, in fact, ‘possessive’.
  236                                MORPHOLOGY  object, as indeed is the case in some Northern Tati dialects, such as Now-
 kiani, spoken in the Upper Tarom.98              In Southern Tati dialects the
  construction has undergone various degrees of weakening, with Eshte-
  hardi remaining the most conservative of the group in this respect.
    332. The agent is expressed in the oblique case generally in Eshtehardi
 and Chali, less consistently in Ebrahim-abadi, and only rarely in Xiaraji
 (v. § 153), e.g.
            Cha.    cemen piar (A) bat (B) ‘my father said’
            Esh.    Hasan-e (A) hasar-es (C-A) darund bu (B) ‘Hasan had
                    swept the yard’
            Ebr.    Hasan-e (A) beza-s (B-A) bevast (B) ‘Hasan hit [and] ran
                    off’ Only Chali has preserved a set of agential pronouns (v. 218). In Ebrahim-
 abadi the agent appears in the oblique case mostly in the speech of the
 older generation. A plural agent, however, is generally put in the direct
 case. This is also the case when the agent is a pronoun, e.g.
            Ebr.    qocen (A) ewa-sen (C-A) axa (B) ‘the rams drank water’
                    a (A) asb-em (C-A) beza (B) ‘I hit the horse’
 In the other dialects the agent is generally expressed in the direct case and
 the logical direct object treated as the direct object in a non-passive con¬
 struction (v. § 158), e.g.
            Sag.   raha amia-ferar-es (C-A) bedi (B) ‘he saw his cousin on
                   the way’
                   ra:yatun-es (C-A) migowast (B) (119) ‘he liked his
                   farmers’
                   salvdrun(C) bar-owarde (B) (95) ‘[they] have taken out
                   [their] trousers’
The agent may be a noun or a pronoun. As a pronoun it may be inde¬
pendent or enclitic. When the agent is a noun or an independent pro¬
noun, it is often resumed by a corresponding enclitic pronoun (v. §§ 222-
224). Examples from Eshtehardi:
   a) a noun as the agent,
           Esh.    Fatemid (A) ndhdr (C) bexdrd (B) ‘Falema (f.) ate lunch’
               Hasan-e (A) ndhdr (C) bexdrd (B) ‘Hasan (m.) ate lunch’
b) an independent pronoun as the agent,
           Esh.    jua (A) nun (C) bexdrd bu (B) ‘she had eaten bread’
                   aga cemen (A) nun (C) bexdrd bu (B) ‘if I had eaten bread’    E.g. varge quc begat the wolf seized the ram’, varge guspanda begata ‘the wolf
seized the ewe’, varge guspande/quce begatend (or begat-es-end) ‘the wolves seized the
ewes/rams’.
                                     VERBS                                   237c) an enclitic pronoun as the agent:
          Esh.    buat-es (B-A) keja misis (C)99 ‘he said: “Where are you
                  going?
                  cemen-i (A) orosieha (C) cera bad beduta (B) ‘why have
                  you sewn my shoes poorly?’
d) the agent resumed by an enclitic pronoun,
          Esh.    gorge (A) misa-s (C-A) bekost (B) ‘the wolf killed the ewe'
                  cemen (A) nun-em (C-A) bexard (B) ‘I ate bread’
                  jinn (A) nun-esun (C-A) bexard (B) ‘they ate bread’
As an agent, or a resumed agent, the enclitic pronoun may be suffixed to a
noun, an adjective, an adverb, a pronoun, a conjunction, or the verb (v.
§ 224 for details and examples).
  333. The verb in a passive construction is generally in the singular.
Only in Eshtehardi were there occasional agreements in number between
a plural animate direct object and the verb, e.g.
          Esh. Hasane (A) lazak-eha (C) bezandi (B) ‘Hasan beat (pi.)
                  the children’
           but,   gorgun (A) gespend-ehd (C) bekost (B) ‘the wolves killed
                  (sg.) the sheep’ (pi.)
                  cemen orosi-eha (C) bad beduta (B) ‘[he] has sewn (sg.)
                my shoes poorly’
In Eshtehardi, where the passive construction shows the least degree of
weakening, the verb generally follows the gender of the logical direct
object in the perfect and pluperfect, but in the preterit and imperfect such
agreement occurs less frequently, and mainly when the object is animate100
(v. §§ 269, 278), e.g.
           Esh. Hasan-e (A) hasar-es (C-A) darund bu (B) ke zaminlarz
                  bebu ‘Hasan had swept the yard (m.) when the earth¬
                  quake occurred’
                  Hasan-e (A) vafra-s (C.A) derunda bia (B) ke ... ‘Hasan
                  had swept the snow (f.) when ...’
                  Hasan-e (A)fur-es (C-A) beza (B) ‘Hasan beat his son’
                  Hasan-e (A) tetia-s (C-A) bezia (B) ‘Hasan beat his
                  daughter’
           but,   gorg-e (A) misa-s/quc-es (C-A) beza (B) ‘the wolf hit the
                  ewe/ram’
V. § 335, n. 2, for further examples.","[234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239]"
"    89. Uninflected nouns, singular in form, may have, as in Persian, a
    generic or plural sense, e.g.
              Cha.       qoc berxinas xwar-tar-e ‘it is better if you buy rams’
                         sildnaka deraxt-u becina ‘pick ye apricots from the tree’
              Tak.       kaqaz mamasten bar-e ‘don’t stick papers on the door’
                         zeynia xora yd mardakl ‘are women better or men?’
              Ebr.       veya sard anar parta mekare ‘he throws pomegranates
                         over the bride’s head’
              Esf.       ke varg cara-s para niari ‘so that wolves do not tear his
                         sheep’
    90. In the singular direct object of a verb, the definition is generally
    marked in all the dialects by the use of the oblique case, if the object is
    not defined by an adjacent word, e.g.
             Cha.    alaf undi cuare ‘give grass to the sheep’
                     cf. alafe undi cuare ‘give the grass to the sheep’
             Tak.    qoc ager beza amager ‘buy ram[s], don’t buy goat[s]’
                     cf. qoc(c)e bo ‘bring the ram’
             Esh.    kara mi gar end ‘they are making butter’
                     cf. maste kari (obi.) migarend ‘they are getting the butter
                     of the yogurt’
                     Hasane siva (f.) ceda lit. ‘give apple (indef.) to H.’
                     cf. Hasane siva ce(s)da ‘give the apple to H.’

                     cf. saba fele muda Zinata ‘tomorrow he will give the
                     money to Z.’
             Dan.    hamasala misu luas bigiri ‘every year he used to go to
                     catch fox[es]’

                                         NOUNS                                        67
The use of the oblique case for the definite direct object, however, depends
on certain conditions. The rules of the Ebrahim-abadi usage, which is
typical, are given below as an illustration (v. § 156 for further discussion).
   The use of the oblique case for a definite direct object in Ebrahim-
abadi depends on whether the object is inanimate, animal, or human,
and on how it is defined:
   a) If the object is inanimate, it is expressed in the oblique unless
defined by a genitive or a possessive adjective, e.g.
            Ebr.    gandem-e beba ard ka ‘take the wheat [and] grind it’
                    ji gandem-e ard ka ‘grind this wheat (not that wheat)’
                    a mev-e me nen-a bare ‘pull out that hair from within the
                    bread’
                    cf. coma gandem beba ‘take out our wheat’
                    Hasan-e gandem ard ka ‘grind H.’s wheat’
b) If an animal, the object is generally expressed in the oblique even
when defined by a genitive or a pronominal adjective, e.g.
           Ebr.     qoce beba ‘take the ram away’
                    cemen qoce sard berbin ‘slaughter my ram’
                    Hasan-e qoce sard berbin3 ‘slaughter H.’s ram’
Some speakers, however, vacillate between the use of the oblique and
the direct.
   c) If a person, the object is always expressed in the oblique; but when
the noun is defined by a genitive or a possessive adjective, the oblique
in -(a)r is used (v. § 134), otherwise the oblique in -e, e.g.
           Ebr.     cupun-e hamberaya beba ‘take along the shepherd’
                   ji miard-e beba ‘take along this man’
           but     coma cupun-ar beba ‘take along our shepherd’
                    dadar-em rayyat-ar mazan ‘don’t beat my father’s farmer’
                    Hasane amu-ar/bibi-ar beba ‘take along H.’s uncle/aunt’
                    cemen dosmen-ar raha-made ‘don’t admit my enemy’
d) Masculine proper names of persons are expressed in the oblique in
-e, not in -(a)r, e.g.
          Ebr. Hasan-e xdstane hamberaya beba ‘take Hasan together
                    with yourself’
Feminine proper names are expressed in the uninflected form, e.g.
           Ebr.     Zinata mazan ‘don’t beat Zinata’
For a more general discussion of the definite direct object and examples
from other dialects, v. § 156.
3 I take sard ‘head’ as part of a compound verb; cf. Pers. sar-boridan ‘to cut the throat
of, to slaughter’.
    68                                MORPHOLOGY                                      B. NUMBER    91. Southern Tati possesses two numbers: singular and plural.                  Both
    numbers generally distinguish a direct and an oblique case.4 Whereas
    the dialects show general agreement in the oblique plural ending, the
    direct plural ending exhibits considerable variety. (V. §§ 104, 105 ff. for
    a more detailed discussion of number.)
                                      C. GENDER
    92. Southern Tati distinguishes two grammatical genders. Where there
    is a natural gender it coincides with the grammatical one. The distinction
of gender may be observed in substantives, adjectives, certain pronouns,
and some verbal forms.
      The gender morpheme in the singular is nil for masculine nouns and
unstressed -a for the feminine. In the plural, gender is not marked.
Notes:
   1. The feminine ending -a is generally less open and slightly less spread in Takestani
[e, a] than in Chali, Eshtehardi, and Xiaraji; v. §§ 30, 42.
   2. Only rarely does a feminine noun end in a stressed -a, the three attested excep¬
tions being:
            Cha. zania ‘woman’
                  nana ‘mother’
                  konya ‘houswife’93. a) Generally, the Southern Tati dialects agree in the gender of nouns.
Examples from feminine nouns:

xoza            xoz{z)a      xoza                                     ‘sand, gravel’

4
      Except Tak. and Dan. which have but one plural form each; v. §§111, 126.

 b) Even in cases where nouns of the same meaning are etymologically
 different <Dr are of borrowed origin, they often share the same gender.
 Examples from feminine nouns:
  Cha.          Tak.       Esh.       Xia.      Sag.

  jigara       jigara
veskenja                   gacaraj     calaqa1            ‘sparrow’
c) However, differences in gender also occur, though not frequently,
among the dialects, e.g.
 Cha.       Tak.         Esh.      Xia.       Sag.
xoyyd (m.) xoya (f.)   xuya (m.)                          ‘(wooden)
                                                            shovel’
hollu (m.) astaleva    holua (f.) holua (f.) estalua (f.) ‘peach’
                (f.)
dSma (f.)    dom(b)        dom(b)8     domb (m.) domb (m.) ‘tail’
                (m.)         (m.)
xarit (m.)   xarita (f.)                                        ‘omelette’
pita (f.)    pita (f.)     pit (m.)    peta (f.)                ‘moth’
tu (m.)     tuya (f.)     tu (m.)     tu (m.)                   ‘cream’
zu (m.)     zivia (f.)                                          ‘howling’
d) When the meaning; of a noun. implies a natural gender, the gram-
matical gender parallels it, e.g.
 Cha.       Tak.        Esh.       Xia.        Ebr.      Sag.
xwaka      xaka        xaka       xwaka       xwaka     xaca         ‘sister’
magava     magava gowa            magowa gowa           gowa         ‘cow’
Cf. Cha. risa (f.) ‘beard’, but esbia-ris (m.) ‘elder man (lit. having a white
beard)’.
6 The two words davata and dowda obviously belong to different layers of borrowing
from Persian: Cf. Arab-Pers. davat.
6 Cf. further Esf. *qacara (Resala, 47).

70                                 MORPHOLOGY     94. Personal feminine names take the feminine morpheme -a and are
declined as ordinary feminine nouns, e.g.
                Cha. Zenaba (Arab-Pers. Zeynab), Golaba (Pers. golab
                   ‘rosewater’), Maha (Pers. mdh ‘moon’), Xanoma (Mong-
                   Pers. xanom ‘lady’), Maryama (Aram-Pers. Maryam),
                   Zinata (Arab-Pers. zinat ‘ornament’); Tak. Zeynaba,
                   Maryama, Xadijia (Arab-Pers. Xadija), Fatemia, Sa:r{a)-
                   banuya (Pers.      Sahr-banu);    Esh. Fatemia,      Maryama-,
                   Ebr. Xadija, Sarambenua, Sakina (Arab-Pers. Sakina),
                   Zeynaba', Sag. Fatemia, Sarabunua, Zeynaba.
95. Separate terms are employed for the masculine and feminine of
some animals, e.g.
                  masc.                          fern.
           Cha.    qoc ‘ram’                     misa ‘ewe’
                  yonagav ‘bull calf’            dogi ‘heifer’
           Tak.   yonagav ‘bull calf’            dogia ‘heifer’
           Esh.   junga ‘bull calf’              dugia ‘heifer’
           Cha.   xoruz ‘cock’                   karka ‘hen’
           Tak.   xorest ‘cock’                  karka ‘hen’
           Sag.   xorost ‘cock’                  karga ‘hen’
           Cha.   asbd ‘dog’                     macci ‘bitch’
           Esh.   lok ‘male camel’               mejia, arvunia9 ‘female camel’
96. In the case of nouns denoting animals, when no separate term is
used to distinguish gender, the feminine may be formed by adding -a to
the masculine, or, if the generic name is feminine, as in xara ‘donkey’,
the masculine may be obtained by dropping the feminine morpheme.
In some cases ma(ya)- ‘female’, or nar(a)~ ‘male’, is prefixed to the
generic noun to show its gender.          To decide whether the loss of the
feminine morpheme always implies a change of gender requires further
investigation. Examples:
                  masc.                          fern.
           Cha.   varg                           varga ‘wolf’
                  ostor                          ostora ‘camel’
                  gusak                          gusaka ‘young camel’
                  guar                           guara ‘calf’
                  xar                            xara ‘donkey’
                  ordak                          ordaka ‘duck’
                  qaz                            qaza ‘goose’9 Lok is a general term for the male camel; mejia is a young female camel up to four
years old; arvunia is a female camel four years old and upward.

97. In Ebrahim-abadi and Sagz-abadi non-fruit-bearing trees
culine and end in dar ‘tree’. Fruit-bearing trees are feminine and end
with ddra, except when the fruit noun is masculine, in which case dar is
used instead.
     Examples with dar:
            Ebr., Sag.      sala-dar ‘poplar tree’
                    yuza dar ‘walnut tree’
            Ebr.    zorna-dar, Sag. via-dar ‘willow tree’
                    cenara-dar ‘sycamore tree’
                    nalbanda-dar. Sag. narbanda-dar ‘elm tree’

                    miva-dar, Sag. amboria-dar ‘pear tree’
            Sag.    dlbdlua-dar ‘sour cherry tree’
Cf. Ebr., Sag. yuz ‘walnut’; anar ‘pomegranate; Ebr’. miva, Sag. ambori10
‘pear’; Sag. albalu ‘sour cherry’ - all masculine nouns.
     Examples with ddra:
            Ebr.    asifa-ddra, Sag. asua-dara ‘apple tree’
                    veyma-dara, Sag. veyma ddra ‘almond tree’

                   senjia-dara ‘wild olive11 tree’
                   aleva-dara ‘plum tree’
Note:
  An exception is Sag. gilasa-dara, since gilds ‘cherry’ is masculine. My notes are not
sufficient to determine the position of the other dialects in this respect.1210   This word occurs, however, as fern, in Cha., Tak., Esh., and Xia.
11   Pers. senjed.
12   In the Tati of Nowkian in the Upper Tarom all tree names are masculine.
72                                MORPHOLOGY97a. Adjectives used substantively indicate the gender, e.g.
           Cha.    sur\-a (m., f.) ‘the red one’
                   fercel/-a ‘the dirty one’
                   capell-a ‘the left-handed one’
           Esh.    lazakf-a ‘little one, child’
           Ebr.    pilalpilia ‘the big one, the elder’
        cf. Esh.   nd zenia ke lazaka bia ‘when this woman was a child’
                   na cupun ke lazak bu ‘when this shepherd was a child’

V. § 205 for the distinction of gender in adjectives in general.
   98. A number of feminine nouns, mainly borrowed words originally
ending in stressed -a, end in -ia, with -i- taking the stress. Chali generally,
Ebrahim-abadi and Sagz-abadi to a lesser extent, and Eshtehardi rarely,
however, drop the final -a. Hence a number of feminine nouns in -i.
   a) Examples of feminine nouns in -ia:
           Cha.    nomazia, Tak. nomazia, Esh. numazia. Sag. numazia,

                          A. GENERAL REMARKS
256. The verbal system of Southern Tati is based on two stems: past and
present (§ 258 ff.); four common moods: imperative, indicative, subjunc¬
tive, and optative (v. below); two numbers and three persons. Various
tenses are formed with verbal prefixes (§ 286 ff.) and appropriate stems
and endings (§ 299 If.). From the point of view of tense formation, one
may distinguish a system of simple and periphrastic tenses; the latter are
based on the past participle of the main verb and a finite form of the
substantive verb (§ 346 If.).
  Southern Tati makes a distinction between transitive and intransitive
verbs in formation and syntax of past tenses. The past tenses of transitive
verbs are governed by the passive construction (§ 331 If.).
  Nominal forms of the verb are the infinitive (§ 345), the present and
past participles, and the agent nouns (§§ 343-344).
  The passive voice and the causative are marked by special formations
(§§ 341-342); in conjugation the passive and the causative run parallel to
active verbs.
  The Southern Tati verbs generally indicate the gender of the subject in
the 3rd person singular, and occasionally also in the 1st and 2nd person
singular; (§ 269 If.).
  257. The indicative mood has five tenses: the present, the preterit, the
imperfect, the perfect, and the pluperfect(s). The subjunctive mood has
two common tenses: present and perfect; a subjunctive pluperfect was also
attested in Chali. The subjunctive present is occasionally used in some of
the dialects with imperative force (i.e, as injunctive, v. § 308). The op¬
tative has but one tense, which refers to the future (§ 309). Only in Xiaraji
was a special formation for a conditional past (3rd pers. sing.) attested
(§ 330). The future has no special formation in Southern Tati and is
expressed by the indicative present.     A progressive present with peri-

1 The tentative phonemic systems presented here are intended to give a clearer picture
of the dialects and aid in the study of them. But in order not to obscure phonetic facts
and to allow for alternative phonemizations I have indicated some of the important
allophones in my otherwise phonemic transcription. All such cases have been mention¬
ed in the phonetic section. V. p. 26 for some problems of phonemization.
2 In phonemic transcription c and j will be used instead of c and /.
32                                   PHONOLOGY
      .
     4 p is bi-labial.
      .
     5 t is apico-alveolar.
     6. k is dorso-velar, its point of articulation varying somewhat according
to its phonetic environment. Before front vowels it has a more advanced
articulation [k], e.g.
            miken [mi'k'en] ‘so much’
            kia [k‘i IJae] ‘house’
In medial position preceded by s, k appears as half voiced among some
speakers, e.g.
         hiski ['hijki] ‘no one’
            beskas [bej'kaes] ‘he broke’
            eskambel [ejkaem'bel] ‘gluttonous’
 .
7 The places of articulation of the voiced stops b, d, and g are the same
as those of their voiceless counterparts, g, like k, has a range between
velar and palatal, according to its phonetic context (v. § 6).
     8. P. The phoneme represented by ? is not normally realized as a
glottal stop [?]. In loan-words from Persian of an Arabic origin, [?] is
replaced by lengthening the preceding or following sound, or by the
glide h. Occasionally it is simply omitted. Examples:
            allon < Arab-Pers. alPan ‘now’
            ra:ycit, rayyat < Arab-Pers. raPiyyat ‘peasant’
            ba:dazd ‘after that’ < Arab-Pers. baPd- ‘after’
            nal < Arab-Pers. naPl ‘horseshoe’ (here lengthening has led to a
                    qualitative change)
            sd(h)at < Arab-Pers. saPat ‘hour’
        (V. § 70.)
In some of the Chali poetry composed by Rezai and Ameli, and recited
by them, ? was pronounced as the glottal stop, e.g.
            [ba'Pes] ‘motive’
            ['Pserje ^Pla] ‘the highest throne’
But such pronunciations are modeled directly on literary Persian. An
entirely satisfactory solution to the phonemic representation of loan¬
words with an original [?] is difficult to find. One solution would be to
set up the phoneme P, with length [:] as its allophone. Another would be
to consider length [:] a phoneme representing an omitted sound (v. § 70).
In view of the occurrence of [?] in some literary compositions, I have
taken P as a phoneme, but I shall indicate [:] as such in my transcription
whenever it occurs.
     The faint catch which marks the beginning of the vowel after a juncture
is much weaker than [?] and does not justify any phonemic representation.
                                          CHAU                                33                                   2. Affricates9. c [tj] and j [d3] are lamino-alveolar or lamino-domal. For all practical
purposes they may be treated as stops, even though they end with a slight
spirantization characteristic of the affricates.
        .
    10 In secondary contact, j, when followed by the voiced dental stop d,
becomes the fricative z [3], e.g.
            baj da binom [;ba3 d^t 'binom] ‘tell (me) that I may see’
z [3], however, does not occur within a word except before d, and only in
the following:
            [he3ldae] ‘eighteen’
            [nu3'd3e] ‘nineteen’
            [d0'r03d] ‘coarse, big’
            [esde'ha] ‘dragon’
Since zd does not stand in contrast to jd in the available material, [3]
must most probably be taken as an allophone of j.3Note:
The above words all seem to be borrowings from Persian. Their equivalents in Per¬
sian, however, do not have jd for Chali [3d]. They are: hezda, nuzda, dorost, and
ezdehd.","[33, 34, 35]"

193 Ra ‘for, to’. Examples:
            Xia.    sang parda maka qoc-e ra ‘don’t throw stone[s] at the
                    ram’
                    alafbusin ja asb-e ra ‘give (lit. throw) grass to that horse’
                    mis a ra alaf berenja ‘give ye (lit. pour) grass to the ewe’
                    owa baw dadar-em ra ‘bring water for my sister’Note:
In agardastan-a vdyma berxin ‘buy [some] almond[s] on your return’, -d is probably the
postposition d ‘in’, noted once in Chali (v. § 183) and frequently used in Sagz-abadi
and Danesfani, rather than a short form of ra, since the -r- is realized also after conr
sonants.       .
194 a and da These two postpositions mean ‘from’ (Pers. az).
a) da occurs only in example (cf. § 195, c, iii)
         Xia.  kevz da havvaz ‘jump over the stream’
                (cf. Pers. az juy bepar)

                     from your village’
 Note:
    In berarun-es-an i-es besiaf Tehrun ‘of his brothers one had gone to Tehran’, I am
 not certain whether an is a variant of the postposition -a or a conjunction meaning
 ‘and’ (Pers. ham!). In Ram. an occurs in the following example: maslahat xostan-es-an
 ye3i ‘the [choice of the] right course is with him’ (Resala, 59). The Persian translation
 given in the Resala is          j I az maslahat, which seems to confirm an as a variant
 of a (appearing before a vowel?).35

                     ku ‘from, in’
                     (r)a ‘for’
                    a ‘from, in’
                    da ‘from, in’
                    (n)ende ‘with, by’
                    non ‘with’ (v. e below)
a) ku from, in is used as Tak. xo for both animate and inanimate objects
(cf. §§ 179, 185), e.g.
           Ebr.     Hasan-e ku apars ‘ask from Hasan’
                    zamin-e ku qovvat megere ‘it obtains strength from the
                    earth’
                    ji qoc-e ku hoed eb ni ‘there is no defect in this ram’
                    ji dara ku eb ni ‘there is no defect in this tree’36
b) ir)d ‘for’, r- is realized only after a vowel. Examples:
           Ebr.     bar a rd dastd berxin ‘buy [a] handle for the spade’
                    qocen-a alaf undi ‘give grass to the ewes’
c) a and da ‘in, from, from within’.37 a is often followed by the post-

reflect an older usage.

    B. Dana’i, after quoting this example, commented that the older and the more
correct usage would be ji dara da ‘in this tree’.
    The remarks made about considering da a separate postposition in Takestani
apply also in Ebrahim-abadi; v. § 189.
                              POST- AND PREPOSITIONS                             129position da, which amplifies its sense, da also appears occasionally by
itself (cf. §§ 189, 194). Examples:
     i. a in a locative sense, e.g.
             Ebr.    besa men razen-a ‘go into the gardens’
                     qalie hama men otaqen-a-de-end38 ‘all the rugs are in the
                     rooms’

                    one’
ii. a in the ablative sense, e.g.
             Ebr.    ewa cdh-a bekas ‘draw water from the well’
                     angur kud-y bar del raz-a da ‘from where have you brought
                     the grape[s]? From the vineyard’
                     qerqi balah-a-da     veskinja   megere    ‘the sparrow-hawk
                     catches the sparrow from the air (lit. from the above)’
                     Hasan bar-a bema ‘Hasan came [in] from the door’

                    juaren-a magu ‘don’t take from those’Note:
A final -a combines with the postposition a in -a, e. g.
            Ebr. qazqina ugerat ‘he took [it] from the pot (qazqina ‘pot’)’
                 nen tana-de-r-e ‘the bread is in the oven (tana ‘oven’)’iii. da in an ablative sense, e.g.
             Ebr.   jagu-da besa ‘go from here’
iv. da in a locative sense, e.g.
          Ebr. jagu-de-r-e ‘it is here’ (v. § 351)
d) (n)ende39 ‘with, by means of’ (cf. § 181). -n is realized before a vowel.
Examples:
        Ebr.         mixe cakkos-ende bekun ‘hit the nail with the hammer’
                     atas ambbr-ende ugu ‘pick up the [charcoal] fire with the

                     dadar-i-nenda ‘by means of your father’      V. §§ 76, 351 for da/de preceding the verb ‘to be’.

                        u ‘with, by means of’
     a) cu/ku ‘from, in’. Examples:

ii. in an ablative sense,44 e.g.

                    house (lit. from the quarter of his house)’45
Notes:
   1. A final -a or -a merges with the postposition a, e.g.
            Sag. ddra jirow jir ‘come down from the tree (ddra ‘tree’)’
                    cid va ‘she was in the house (cia ‘house’)’

                   jem daryd (111) ‘in this sea (daryd ‘sea’)’
2. There are two instances of an -a ending in A. A.’s materials which are hard to
account for:
            Sag. i asb-a owa mun bar-uma (111) ‘a horse emerged from the water’
                   cize zania (121) ‘what is it, O woman?’40c) (r)a ‘for, to’, r- is realized only after a vowel. Examples:

                    alaf berenj earva ra ‘give (lit. pour) grass to the sheep’44   Notice that in most of these examples a locative sense is also implied.

197. In a number of instances -a appears in A. A.’s material with an
ablative or locative sense.48
   a) with an ablative sense:
            Sag.    dajem pahlevun-a i asbab bedbzddm (107) ‘so that I steal
                    an object from this wrestler’

                    esta manzel-a (119) ‘from your house’
                    jahandam-a bar-umia (97) ‘he had come out of Hell’
                    cul-a uma (95) ‘he came from the pasture’
                    je rang-bdzun-a ba (119) ‘she was one of these wily ones’
b) in a locative sense:
            Sag.    secar-a taman d-bam (105) ‘we became perfect in hunting’
                    rdh-a kat (115) ‘he started off (lit. he fell in the road)’
                    ceman cadera darya Iow-ai9 bezana (111) ‘pitch my tent
                    at the seashore’47 Here, as in some following examples, -a follows the definite direct object (cf. Pers.
rd). In some cases, -a may stand for the oblique ending -e; cf. § 172, a, n.
48 Whether this is genuine, reflecting a subdialect, or is due to defective notation or
printing, it is difficult to say. a in this sense does not occur in my materials, which be¬
long to the dialects of the Mon Qala and Qala districts. Some of these examples
probably reflect the Ebrahim-abadi dialect (A. A., 94-99), since the informant, ac¬
cording to the author, was a native of Ebrahim-abad, even though a resident of Sagz-
abad. But that is not the case with some other examples. In some cases, a may be a
variant of the oblique ending -e; cf. § 172, a, n., and cf. hame kas-e xuas-hdltare (A. A.,
119) ‘he is happier than anyone’, where apparently -e stands for -a.
49 Unless the word for ‘edge’ is Iowa (cf. Cha. lava, Pers. labd).

Notes:
   1. In mardomun-a maje o mexande (95), translated as ‘she talks and laughs with
people’, -a may mean ‘in, among’ (for a ?) or ‘for, to’ ( (r)a for (r)a ?).
   2. In -cud misisl - jahandam-a (95) ‘where are you going? - To Hell’ -a either means
‘in’ (for a ?) or is a variant of the oblique ending -e, although the object of destination
is generally expressed in the direct case (v. § 157).198. u ‘by means of, with’ (cf. § 180, e). Examples:

Note:
   In A. A. materials, besu dadar-es-o sela maslahat (115) ‘he went to consult with his
father (Arab-Pers. saldh o maslahaty -o seems to be a variant of it. In the two following
examples, o, if correctly recorded, is not easy to explain:
           Sag.   in jaina taraf-o mid (101) ‘he comes this way’
                  dast-o begiratan (162) ‘to let go (lit. to take out of hand [?])’                                      8. Ddnesfdni     .

                    d ‘in, from’
                    ra ‘to, for’
                    vari ‘with’
                    da ‘in’
a) ku ‘from’. In my examples ku is used only with the animate:

                    card ku alafe agi ‘take [away] the grass from the sheep’
                    ja furey ku xabar agi ‘inquire from that boy’
                    je zania ku ‘from this woman’
b) a51 ‘in, from, from within’. When a follows a feminine singular noun,
the feminine morpheme merges with it. Examples:
50  Probably < *zerna + u. Cf. jiow be ‘was with her’, possibly < jia (v. § 217) + u.
51  In the speech of Fasihi, my chief informant, this postposition had a more advanced
and more spread articulation than a, approaching a. To determine whether it may
belong to a different phoneme than a requires further study.

                 ra ‘for’
a) ku ‘from . In all the available examples ku is employed with nouns
denoting a person (cf. a, u, below):
         Esf.    Hasane/Zeynaba ku ugur ‘take from H./Z.’
            (cf. mo bosqab-a ugur ‘take out from the plate’)
                 berar-bm ku aval a-gir ‘ask my brother’
                 darvise ku dparsd ‘inquire from the dervish’
                 mardako ku dparsd ‘inquire from the men’
b) a ‘in, from, out of’. Examples:

                     hundred tumdn (unit of money) each’
                     mo raz-a bekatia ‘it is lying in the garden’
ii. in an ablative sense,

                    poste bar-a barra-s ugurt ‘he picked the spade from
                    behind the door’
                    xakaron-es-a i-s bates ‘from among his sisters one said’
                    ja bar-a bigir ‘take [it] from that door’
                    jd divar-a uvij ‘pry [it] away from that wall’
c) u (?)    When a noun ends in -a, stressed or unstressed, the final -a
merges with a postposition meaning ‘in, from’ into -o, e.g.
            Esf.    sar rdho cemen costo undi pinaduj beduji ‘on [your] way
                     give my shoes to the cobbler to sew (rdha ‘road’)’
                    gusti-ji tiro denia tana ‘and put the meat [which is] in
                     the pot on the stove {lira ‘pot’)’
                     aso be coma kio ‘tonight come to (lit. in) our house’
                     (kid ‘house’)’
                     Hasan Mammad-es mo rdho bind'Hasan saw Mohammad
                     on the road’
                     mo kio uger ‘take [it] from the house’
But no postposition u as such occurs in my notes. Considering the Chali
-6 < -a + u (v. § 81, c), however, one is encouraged to assume the post¬
position involved as u, ‘in, from’, which occurs in both Chali and Xiaraji
(v. §§ 181, 192). The assumption is strengthened by coma kiu, ‘in our
house’, a variant given by ‘Amui for coma kio. He considered both
correct. It seems that whereas ku has been retained for human beings,
u tends to be replaced by a (a postposition used also in the neighboring
Takestan), but u is kept where it has merged with -a. Cf. the very same
situation in Xoznini, below.52Note:
  Probably the postposition u is involved also in i-sado ‘(in) this time’, d-sado ‘(in) that
t\mc\ je-lako ‘herQ',jd-lako ‘there’. Cf. a mixa jdlako uvij ‘pull out that nail from there’.
d) ra ‘for, to’. Examples:            Esf.    Hasan-e ra pul undi ‘give money to Hasan’
62 u was attested in the following example, in which u follows a direct object (v. § 180,
d): Esf. a tedpul-u umagur ‘don’t take money from that girl’.

     201 The following postpositions occur:
                       a ‘from, in’
                       ra ‘for’
                       (u ‘in, from’)
                       a ‘than’ (?)
     a) a ‘in, from’. Examples:
       i. in an ablative sense,
              Xoz.    bara-s poste bar-a ugerat-es ‘he picked his spade from
                       behind the door’
                      kama vaytna deraxt-a ‘becina ‘pick some almond[s] from
                      the tree’
                      cah-a ewa barow ‘take out water from the well’
                      a mix difar-a barow ‘pull out that nail from the wall’
                      ji deraxt-a besa ja deraxt ‘go from this tree to that tree’
                      sanduqa mun-a ugerates ‘he picked it from inside the
                   trunk’
 ii. in a locative sense,
              Xoz.    low daryah-a cador-es bezand ‘he pitched his tent at the
                 seashore’
 b) ra ‘for’. Examples:
              Xoz.    solunaka coma ra ugi bo ‘buy and bring [some] apricot[s]
                      for us’
                      carva ra alaf undi ‘give grass to the sheep’
c) u ‘in’.53 The reasons for supposing a postposition u in Xoznini are
almost the same as in Esfarvarini (v. § 200, c). Examples:
          Xoz. mon rdho ‘on the way’
                      bey coma kiu54 ‘come to our house’
                     dada-s kiu va kia dari-s mika ‘his sister remained (lit.
                was) in the house [and] took care of the house’
d) a appears in several examples with the meaning ‘than’, e.g.
             Xoz.    em bezin jd bezon-a xortar-enda ‘these goats are better
                     than those goats’   In the available examples u means ‘in’, but probably it also means ‘from’ as else¬
where; v. § 176.
64    No variant kio occurs in Xoznini as it does in Esfarvarini.
                               POST- AND PREPOSITIONS                        137                    em teteyn (sic, v. § 132, fn.) jd teton-a xortar-enda ‘these
                    girls are better than those girls5
In a number of examples, however, the comparison of an adjective is
made without a, e.g.
          Xoz.      fera titia xortar-e ‘[a] boy is better than [a] girl5                                  B. PREPOSITIONS
   .
202 Prepositions are comparatively rare, and it is doubtful if any of them
are genuinely Tati55.       One possible exception may be avi ‘without’,56
which occurs in Xiaraji and Xoznini, e.g.
          Xia.      avi atas nun nemise ‘without fire bread cannot be’
                    avi tefang masa cul ‘don’t go outdoors without a rifle5
          Xoz.      em kar avi pul a-ne-m-be ‘this business will not be fixed
                    without money5
In polite or affected speech and in poems affected by Persian poetry, a
greater number of prepositions are employed.
  The following prepositions occur:
  a) ta, da ‘until, up to5, e.g.
          Cha.      da berasasen-a ‘before reaching (lit. until reaching)5
          Tak.      ta key ‘until when?5
          Xia.      jiaga da java deraxtun ‘from here to those trees5
                    jiaga da Danesfon ‘from here to Danesfan5
b) bi ‘without5,57 e.g.
          Cha.      bi esta ‘without you (sg.)5
          Xia.      adami bi dosman anembe ‘[a] man cannot be without
                    enemies (sg.)5
c) be ‘to, on, with5, e.g.
          Tak. ta be salamat ‘may you be in good health (lit. you with
                    health)5
          Esh.      naha ...be ohde-ye mosta.jere ‘these are incumbent on
                    the tenant5
          Xia.      bemasenden be difar ‘stick on the wall5
d) dar ‘in5, e.g.
          Cha.      agar ketmon yara-sa dar je kar ‘if you should hide [the
                    facts] in this affair555 For the possible use of u as a preposition in Chali, v. § 180, e.
66 This may belong, however, to an older layer of borrowings from Persian, bi
‘without’ also occurs in Xiaraji; v. below, b.
67 V. above, for Xia. avi, ‘without’.
 138                             MORPHOLOGYe) ba ‘with, by means of’, e.g.
           Esh.   ba. cend sar aela ‘with several dependents’
           Xia.   Mohammad bef ba jomle yarun ‘there was M. with all
                  [his] companions’
/) baraye ‘for’, e.g.
           Esh.   benvest baraye bibia-fur-em ‘he wrote to (lit. for) my
                  aunt’s son’
202a. A number of nouns used with pre- or postpositional force to
indicate an indirect object are found in all the dialects. These are dis¬
tinguished, however, from actual pre- or postpositions by the fact that
as nouns they are capable of taking case endings and of being followed
by a postposition. When they precede a noun, the noun may still be
followed by a postposition. Chief among these are the equivalents to
Pers. sar, mian, and bar.
   a) sar, sa:, sa ‘on top of, on, to, at, above (lit. head, top, end)’ is used
as both a postposition and a preposition, e.g.
          Cha.    sar taxt-u unest ‘he sat on the throne’
          Tak.    sang mazan deraxt-e sa{r) ‘don’t throw stone[s] up at the
                  tree’
                  bon-e sar mase ‘don’t go on the roof’
                  aselta sar mase ‘don’t go up the ladder’
                  bese yun-e sa(r) ‘go to the field’
          Xia.    havvaz sa: asb ‘jump on the horse’
                  bemassen sa: difar ‘stick on the wall’
                  bese sa: deraxt ‘climb up the tree’
          Dan.    uni Hasane sar zenu ‘put on Hasan’s knee’
          Xoz.    deraxtun sar sang masin ‘don’t throw stone[s] at the
                  trees’
       Cf. Tak. pellekon-e sar-a beru jir ‘come down from the top of the
                  staircase’
                  coma kid kifcina sar-ada-r-e ‘our house is at the head of
                  the alley’
b) mon, mun, mo, mo ‘in, into, in the middle of, on, among (lit. middle,
inside, center)’ occur both as post- and prepositions, e.g.
          Cha.    mo raz-u kar miare ‘he works in the garden’
                  ddsin mo sanduq-e ‘throw [it] in the trunk’
                  amberaz mo sanduq-u bu ‘the clothing was in the trunk’
                  unest mo sat -u ‘he sat in the yard’
          Xia.    beso mon raz ‘he went into the garden’
          Dan.    basin mon tana ‘throw [it] into the oven’

      Cf. Xoz.   sanduqa mon-a ugerat-es ‘he took it from inside the trunk’
c) var, va: ‘near, beside, to (lit. side, bosom)’, e.g.
          Xia.    besa va: deraxt ‘go near the tree’
          Dan.   besa Hasan-e var ‘go to Hasan’
                              III. ADJECTIVES
                                  A. GENERAL 203. The Persian suffix -tar is employed also in Southern Tati dialects
 for comparison, e.g.
           Cha.    nakua zanid kam-tar-e ta nakua mardak ‘good women
                   (sg.) are fewer than good men (sg.)’
                  pila-tar-eso ‘their elders’
           Sag.   parun-tar ‘earlier’
           Esf.   em aci xwar-tar-e ‘this is better than that’
          Xoz.    em bezin ja bezon-a xor-tar-enda ‘these goats are better
                  than those goats’
The Persian superlative suffix -tarin is not normally used in Southern
Tati, tar is employed to express also the superlative adjective, e.g.
          Esh.    suamina bajia-s hama da xordek-tar-a bia ‘his third
                  sister was the smallest of all’
          Dan.    hammuna qolcomdq-tara adami ke az bidiam vu dadam
                  vu ‘the bravest of all men that I had seen was my father’
                  har ci kok-tara beza bi ponza mane vistar a-ne-m-bia
                  ‘the fattest [a] goat may be, it will not weigh (lit. become)
                  more than fifteen mans’1
                  Zeynaba hamma teton-a nakku-tar-e ‘Z. is the best of all
                  girls’ Cf. § 201, d.
204. Attributive adjectives generally precede the noun and are followed
by an unstressed -a,2 e.g.
          Cha.    carxia cader ‘a circular cador
                  nara gorbia ‘a male cat’
                  paina posga ‘a low [piece of] land’
                  kamba kar ‘a brief work’1 I owe the three Dan. examples to my friend and colleague Dr. B. Faravashi, who
kindly elicited them for me.
2 As is also the case with the first member of a genitival compound; v. § 160.
                                   ADJECTIVES                                   141                  kova qater ‘a grey mule’
                  hafranga gis ‘seven-colored tress[es]’
                  carva-cerena pura jun ‘O, dear sheep-grazing boy!’
          Tak.    paxta bona ‘a broad roof’
                  sowza duya ‘a green amulet’
          Esh.    rusena esta:ra ‘the bright star (the Polar star)’
                  suamina bajia-s ‘his third sister’3
                  sefida gonbaz ‘white dome (metaphorically used for pilaf)’
          Xia.    jarina mala ‘Lower District’4
          Ebr.    jeqela bera ‘the younger brother’
          Sag.    gujela bera ‘the younger brother’
                  agar xara jeysenem undast ‘if I found a good ploughshare’
Substantives used as adjectives follow the same rule, e.g.
          Cha.    bassena angura ‘[suitable-for] tying grape[s] (i.e., grapes
                  which are to be dried)’
          Tak.    mes(s)a mala ‘copper trowel’
          Xia.    sir a barun ‘powerful rain (lit. leonine rain)’
              Cf. genitival compound, § 160.
205. Attributive adjectives do not show the gender. Predicative adjec¬
tives, however, mark the gender in some of the dialects. Examples are
attested in Chali, Eshtehardi, Ebrahim-abadi, and Sagz-abadi:
          Cha. cemen xar bad-sar ni ‘my [male] donkey is not mulish’
                 cemen xara bad-sara nia ‘my [female] donkey is not mulish’
                  cemen misa apara naxosa bia ‘my ewe was sick last year’
                  em pis bu / ema pisa bia ‘this (m./f.) was bad’
                  ava sia-ranga bia ‘the water (f.) was black-colored’
          Esh.     ma mar da ndxos gahast / na zenia naxosa gahasta ‘this

                  Maryama Pdrcidbdjia mi, Pilaxiavunji-i ‘M. (f.) is not
                  from Parciaba (district), but she is from Pilaxiavun’
                  cemen anamici harvaqt mariza embia ‘whenever my grand¬
                  mother became ill’
          Ebr.    apara naxes bef / apara naxesa fa ‘he/she was ill last year
                   ma bera piley5 / ma xaka piliey6 ‘this brother/sister is big
          Sag.    a xar bo / aya xara va ‘he/she was good’
                  Hasan xar-e / Zeynaba xarey ‘Hasan/Zeynaba is ill’
3 Cf. Esh. narma balesma ‘soft pillow’, Zhukovsky, Mat., II, 119b; torsa xarnir, sour
dough’, ibid., 175b.

  142                                  MORPHOLOGY  My material is not sufficient to show clearly the position of the other
 dialects in this respect. The following examples suggest a different treat¬
 ment in Xiaraji, Danesfani, Esfarvarini, and Xoznini:
             Xia.    HasanIZeynaba naxwas-e ‘Hasan/Zeynaba is ill’
             Dan.    am carva/beza (f.) kok-e ‘this sheep/goat is fat’
             Esf.    Hasan naxos bu ‘Hasan was ill’
                     Zeynaba naxos ba ‘Zeynaba was ill’
            Xoz.     HasanIZeynaba beland-e ‘Hasan/Zeynaba is tall’
 All the above examples are unique.7 V. § 97a for the distinction of gender
 in the adjectives used substantively.
   206. In Chali a predicative adjective generally agrees in number with
 the noun it modifies, e.g.
            Cha.     deraxt soz ne bu ‘the tree was not green’
                    deraxte soze bend ‘the trees were green’
               (Cf. soza deraxt ‘a green tree’
                     soza deraxte ‘green trees’)
                     Hasane asbe xeyli zerang-e ye zurin-e bend ‘Hasan’s dogs
                     were very able and strong’ (asba ‘dog’)
207. In Eshtehardi when a feminine adjective is followed by -i ‘is (fern.)’,
the feminine morpheme does not appear,8 e.g.
            Esh.    Hasan Eshtardia / Maryama Eshtardi-i ‘H./M. is from
                    Eshtehard’
                    na marda kuk-a / nd zenia kuk-i ‘this man/woman is
                    plump’
               Cf. naxos gahasta / naxosa gahast-i ‘he/she has become ill’
208. The following suffixes were attested in the formation of adjectives
from substantives or other adjectives:
   a) -el, e.g.
            Cha.    eskambel ‘gluttonous’ (eskamb ‘belly’)’ (v. § 6)
                  davel ‘fast, agile (cf. dav ugeraten ‘start running’)’
           Cha., Tak. capel ‘left-handed’
                    rastel ‘right-handed’
           Cha.     pasmel ‘hairy’

"    215. The direct case of personal pronouns is used for the subject in
all the dialects, and for the agent in all the dialects except Chali, which
has a set of agential pronouns (v. § 218), and Eshtehardi, which uses the
oblique pronouns.2 The direct forms are used in Eshtehardi also for the
logical direct object in a passive construction (v. § 165, d). Examples:
  a) as subject,
            Cha.    ta az bom ‘until I come’
           Tak.     ta-y da biru ‘you come, too’
            Ebr.    ama naxesiem ‘we are sick’
         Esf.       az menome ‘I don’t come’
b) as agent,

           Xia.     az vindem he awa-s axwa ‘I saw that he drank water’

                    dhen pevl-esen unda ‘they gave money’
          Esf.   az nidiama ‘I have not seen [it]’
c) as logical object,
           Esh.    az-es berestaym ‘he sent me (literally, I am sent by him)’
216. In a few instances in Eshtehardi, it seems that the feminine mor¬
pheme is detached from the verb and attached to the 1st and 2nd person
singular pronoun, creating a feminine-like form for them, e.g.
           Esh.    az bieyma / aza bieym ‘I (f.) was’
                   az nieym / aza niem, a yi ‘1 (f.) am not, she is’
                   to bieysa / toa bieys ‘thou (f.) art’
However, aza and toa are impossible, according to Sadeqi, in cases like:
                   az hama-ruza mivazem(a) ‘I run every day’,
since the gender is not marked in the present. Therefore, perhaps such
forms should be attributed to the loosening of the feminine morpheme
rather than to a feminine form for the 1st and 2nd person singular pro¬
noun. Cf. §§ 275-6, e, fn.; 277, a, fn.; 278, a, fn.","[150, 151]"
"
                         3. Agential Personal Pronouns218. Only Chali has preserved a set of agential pronouns:
                   men ‘I’
                   ta ‘thou’
                   &y, yi ‘he’
                   aya, ya ‘she’
                   amd ‘we’
                   soma ‘you’
                   ayo(n), yo(n) ‘they’
These differ from the direct personal pronouns only in the 1st and 3rd
persons singular, yi ‘he’, ya ‘she’, and yd{n) ‘they’ are, in fact, proximate
demonstrative pronouns (v. § 230 a).
   These pronouns function as the agent in a passive construction. The
3rd persons singular and plural are also used as direct objects, both
logical and grammatical (v. § 230, c). Examples:
  a) as agents,
           Cha.    men as(em) mipet ‘I used to cook food’
                   men quti esta da ‘I gave the box to you (sg.)’
                   men bekoste ‘I have killed’
                  yi kula gerat ‘he took [it] on [his] shoulder[s]’
                  ay-so banjand ‘they cut him’
For further examples of the 3rd person, v. § 230.
  b) as direct object,
                  ay berxin ‘buy it (referring to a ram)’
                  aya berxin ‘buy it (referring to a ewe)’Note:
  Sot., 66, has Cha. az dardem ‘I had’, az midardem ‘I used to have’, which exhibit a
weakening of the use of the agential pronouns in Chali. My informants, however,
always used men in such cases.
                                       PRONOUNS                                      153219. A trace of the use of the agential pronouns is found in a refrain of a
poem attributed to Mira Kuru of Xiaraj (v. p. 24):
                       men nezunest ‘I did not know’
Today Xiaraji uses the direct pronouns for the agent, but in the Resala,
62-64, oblique pronouns undi ‘he5 and undiun ‘they’ are used for the agent,
e.g.
             Ram. undi da (63) ‘he had’
                       undiun midardesun (62) ‘they used to have’
         (cf. Xia.     a farfa-s derutay ‘he has swept snow’
                       ahayn lebasesun bedut ‘they made clothes’)
In the other persons the Resala has direct personal pronouns as agents,
e.g.
             Ram. az midardem (62) ‘I used to have’
                       ama midardemun (62) ‘we used to have’
Note:
  Ram. man, in del-e man (59) ‘my heart’, must be a borrowing from Persian.","[154, 155]"

The villages from north to south are:
     1. Takestan, locally and formerly Siadohon, 36 kms. southwest of
Qazvin at the conjunction of the Tehran-Zanjan and Tehran-Hamadan
roads, in the Dodanga rural district, Zia-abad county.9                   Population6 The treatment of the dialects and citation of examples generally follow the above
order, which is neither geographical nor linguistic, but merely reflects the degree of
the author’s familiarity with these dialects.
7 The speakers of each dialect call their dialect by the name of their village, e.g.
Chalej ‘the dialect of Chal’, and estardi ‘the dialect of Eshtehard’. On the other hand,
they use tati as a general term referring to the group or its members.
8 Dehestan or boluk.
9 BaxS, an administrative district larger than a dehestan and smaller than a sahrestan,
translated by ‘county’ for lack of a better word.

 Qarqasin), Xoruzan (30 kms. northwest of Buyin) and Chalin (26 kms. northwest of
Buyin) small villages with some Tati-speakers from Esfarvarin; in Yar-abad, a
 recently founded prosperous village farm close to Xiaraj, deriving its population mainly
 from the latter; in Palang-abad (36 kms. east of Eshtehard), Baba-Jaru (20 kms.
 southeast of Eshtehard), Nekujar (6 kms. south of Eshtehard), Morad-tappe and
 Sohbat-abad (neighboring villages some 6 kms. west of Eshtehard), all small villages
 belonging to the rural district of Eshtehard and speaking its dialect (distances according
 to Sadeqi).
20                                INTRODUCTION     All these villages, situated in a dry flat country, each surrounded by
stretches of arid land, are generally similar to one another in climate and
crops as well as in social customs. Eshtehard exhibits more urban features
than the rest.
  One overriding feature of life in all these villages is the perennial con¬
cern with rain and water supply. Elaborate systems of water distribution
prevail in the villages, and disputes over water are far from rare. Pro¬
longed periods of drought often threaten the economy of the region. In
1962 a disastrous earthquake brought widespread destruction and suffer¬
ing to some of the villages, notably to Danesfan, Xoznin, Xiaraj, and
Sagz-abad.15 According to the system prevailing in the region, the popu¬
lation in each village is divided into sections (bonas), each section corre¬
sponding to a prescribed amount of land in the village. The leader of each
section, whose office is generally hereditary, supervises the distribution of
the precious water to the plots of the members of his section.16 These
leaders together form an unofficial but influential body which acts as a
sort of village council and decides on important issues. In Chal there are
17 such bonas, each bona having between 40 to 60 fard^P
     The economy of these villages is based mainly on the cultivation of
cereals and animal husbandry. Cotton and sugar beet are grown in some
of the villages, notably in Eshtehard and Danesfan; grapes and other
fruits are grown in Takestan, Esfarvarin, and Ebrahim-abad.                   Many
Chaffs and Danesfanis are active in trading in livestock, whereas many
Eshtehardis go in for peddling and shopkeeping.
     The women work hard. It is their job to bake bread, to cook food, to
draw water from wells, to clean the house, to milk the animals, to make
cheese, yogurt, and butter, to make loaves of dung for fuel, and to pick
clean wheat for the daily bread. In addition, they spin wool and weave
tocks. When a new house is being built, the plastering of the walls, both
inside and out, is women’s work. Should a family own a number of farm
animals without a shepherd, it is generally for the womenfolk to water
the animals. Grooming of the animals, however, is a task for men.
     A dual system of affiliation18 within the village community, which
makes for both cooperation and dispute, generally prevails in all the16 Construction and rehabilitation efforts since the earthquake have considerably
helped the modernization of some of the villages in the region and have partially
changed their face.

a religious coloring.
     The vernacular common to the region is Azerbaijani Turkish. Only
Ramand contains a majority of Tati-speakers. Turkish is still gaining in
the region,19 as it is in the Tati-speaking regions of Azerbaijan. In Tati¬
speaking villages the population is generally trilingual, speaking Tati,
Persian, and Turkish. Turkish-speaking settlers are to be found in most
of these villages; for instance, there are two hundred such settlers in Chal.","[20, 21, 22, 23]"

                                  A. POSTPOSITIONS                                  1. General Remarks     .
175 One of the distinctive features of Tati dialects is the frequent use
of postpositions with indirect objects. Prepositions are rare and generally
of borrowed origin, appearing mainly in affected speech.
    All postpositions are unstressed. They may follow a noun or a pronoun.
When a noun is followed by an enclitic pronoun and a postposition, the
pronoun precedes the postposition (v. below, § 178 fT., for examples).
The object of a postposition is, generally speaking,1 expressed in the
oblique case. This is particularly clear when the object is plural, e.g.
            Cha.     kion-u ‘in the houses’
            Tak.     culon-ada ‘in the pastures’
            Sag.     darun-d becina ‘pick ye from the trees’
When, however, a postposition begins with a vowel2 and its object is
singular, the -e ending of the oblique (v. § 104) disappears, and this creates
the impression of the object being in the direct case, e.g.
            Cha.     cemen jif-u ‘in my pocket’

            Xoz.     cdh-a ewa barow ‘bring out water from the well’
Such postpositions, suppressing the oblique ending in the singular,
create case-like forms. The fact that they are not case endings is revealed,
however, by their appearing frequently also after the plural morpheme
and enclitic pronouns, e.g.
         Cha. asbSn-a ci undi ‘give something to the horses’
                     umdlon-es-a maje ‘he tells his mates’
                     kia-ydn-u ‘from your house’1   The object of Esh. da ‘in, from’ is generally expressed in the direct case; v. § 190, a.
2   No postposition beginning with a vowel was attested in Eshtehardi; v. § 190.

     .
 176 All the dialects have at least one postposition which has both a
 locative and an ablative sense, meaning ‘in, within, from within, from,
 out of’.
   These are ku (Cha., Xia., Ebr.);3 xo (Tak.); u (Cha., Xia);4 a (Tak.,
 Ebr., Esf., Xoz.); a (Sag., Dan.); da (Tak., Esh., Ebr.).
   In Chali and Xiaraji the use of ku and u, which have the same meaning,
‘in, from, out of’, depends on whether the object is human, animal, or
inanimate. In Chali ku is used only for a human object or a personified
non-human object, and u for other objects. In Xiaraji, ku is used for the
animate and u for the inanimate5 object.
         .
   177 Postpositions attested in Southern Tati are:
             ku        ‘from, in’ (Cha., Xia., Ebr., Sag., Dan., Esf.)6 used mainly
                       with an animate object (v. above)
             xo     ‘from, in’ (Tak.) corresponding to ku in Chali, but used
                    with both animate and inanimate objects
             u      ‘in, from, out of, with,’ (Cha.); ‘in, from’ (Xia.); ‘in’ (Esf.,
                    Xoz.);7 ‘by means of, with’ (Sag.)
             ra     ‘for, to’ (all the dialects)
             a      ‘in, from’ (Sag., Dan.)8
             a      ‘in, from, out of’ (Tak., Ebr., Esf., Xoz.); ‘from’ (Xia)9
             da     ‘in, from’ (Esh., Tak., Xia.,10 Ebr.)
             (ie)ndu   ‘with, in’ (Cha.) {-e -appears when a consonant precedes)
             (n)endu ‘by means of’ (Ebr.) (-/?- appears when a vowel precedes)
             bi ‘with’ (Tak.)
3 In Dan. and Esf. available examples, ku has only an ablative sense, but probably it
has also a locative meaning; v §§ 199, a, 200, a.
4 Probably also in Esf. and Xoz. In my notes u occurs only in the locative sense in
these two dialects; v. §§ 200, c, 201, c.
   In Dan. ku is attested so far only for a person, and in Esf. only for an animate
object, v. §§ 199, 200.
6 ku occurs only once in Ram. material with the meaning ‘with’, v. § 192, n.
7 As far as the limited materials in these two dialects show.
8 In a sole example, also in Cha.; v. § 183.
9 My Xia. material contains no example with meanings other than ‘from’; v. § 194.
For probable examples in Sag. from A. A. materials, v. § 197.
10 da occurs only once in my Xia. material; v. § 194. In Tak. and Ebr. it amplifies the
postposition a which generally precedes it; v. §§ 189, 195, c.

"                          F. METHOD AND SCOPE
The dialects are generally treated as a group. However, I have avoided
formulating too many general and all-embracing rules which would have
necessitated making many provisions and exceptions at the expense of
clarity. On the other hand, to have followed an individual treatment of
each dialect too strictly would have meant giving a picture lacking in35 E.g. the words for the eyelash in Eshtehardi were given as mujeka, mujuka and
mojoka. Cf. Sag. umi (111), ume (113), and uma (115) ‘he came’; xdr-a, xar-e (128)
‘is good’; v. also § 172, a, n.
36 E.g. buma/boma ‘he came’ (§ 43), mi-/me- (the imperfective morpheme, § 296),
qoc/quc ‘ram’ (v. §§ 27, 43) may occur in the examples of the same dialect.
28                               INTRODUCTIONunity and coherence. So, as a rule, individual treatment of each dialect,
when deemed necessary, follows the general remarks.
     The grammar deals with phonology and morphology only. Pertinent
syntactical matters, however, have been mentioned in the relevant sections
of the morphology (e.g., uses of cases, § 161 ff.; the passive construction,
§331 If.). Postpositions are discussed, because of their relevance to the
use of cases, under nouns rather than with other particles. The demon¬
strative pronouns, which presented some initial problems and seemed to
require clarification, have received a fuller treatment than some other
pronouns. Demonstrative adjectives are treated together with the demon¬
strative pronouns, as separating them seemed rather artificial. Adjectival
and adverbial suffixes are given under adjectives. Treating the adverbs as
separate from the adjectives did not seem to be warranted by the usage
of the dialects.
     Since no printed texts are available37 for the majority of the dialects,
extensive examples are generally given to illustrate the rules. In such
arrangements, I have preferred to give weight to pragmatic convenience
rather than to strict methodology.","[29, 30]"
"33 When asked about the feminine forms, Re3a’i added -a to the masculine form of the
1st and 2nd persons singular of the subjunctive, commenting hesitantly that forms
with -a are ‘more suitable’ for women:
           Cha. age az bom/boma a:rd mom ‘if I should come (m., f.), I [will] come
                  tomorrow’
                  sabr biarom/biaroma ta ta berasas/-al ‘shall I wait until thou (m., f.)
                  arrivest?’
In actual usage, however, he vascillated and used both forms for both genders. Again
he considered bays-a, the 2nd person singular subjunctive of ‘to be’, as better suited
to women, but without keeping to it in his own usage. He thought the distinction
between ‘men and women’ in the 1st and 2nd persons was somewhat old-fashioned.
For -a as a loose feminine morpheme, v. §§ 216; 277, a, fn. 2; 278, a, fn.
 198                                   MORPHOLOGY            Cha.     HasanelZeynaba non-es bexorda bu ‘H./Z. had eaten

                                       3. Takestani277. Takestani distinguishes the gender in the 3rd person singular of the
present, subjunctive, preterit, imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect. Exam¬
ples:
   a) Present,
           Tak.     a saba ma ‘he comes tomorrow’
                    ava saba maya ‘she comes tomorrow’
                    Hasan     dere     ma    ‘H.    is   coming’
                    Zeynaba deria maya ‘Z. (f.) is coming’
                    ye, -e3i ‘he is’
                yd, -d34 ‘she is’35
b) Subjunctive,36
           Tak.     a menetone verije ‘he cannot run’
                    ava menetonia verijia ‘she cannot run’
                    qoc mogo hinja bexare ‘the ram must eat alfalfa’
                    mis a mogo hinja bexaria ‘the ewe must eat alfalfa’
                    agar xakom verijia pas miskia ‘if my sister should run,
                    her foot will break’
                   agar beram verije ‘if my brother should run’
                    vatan Hasan besu ‘tell H. to go’
                    vdtan Zeynaba besua ‘tell Z. to go’31 Enclitic form of the copula.
35 The distinction of gender is not, however, constant, as may be seen from the fol¬
lowing examples given by A. Rahmani:
           Tak. Hasan!Zeynaba maje az me-ne-tonem bezanem, ‘H./Z. says; “I cannot
                  strike’”
As to the 1st person, Rahmani thought -a is sometimes added to the ending for the
feminine:
           Tak. Hasan maje az saba mom ‘H. says, “I will come tomorrow”’
                  Zeynaba maje az saba mom or moma ‘Z. says, “I will come tomorrow” ’
                  Hasan vace az me-noma ‘H. said, “I do not come”’
                  Zeynaba vace az me-noma ‘Z. said, “I do not come”’
This distinction, however, was not met in the texts; cf. §§ 216; 275-6, e, fn. 1; 278, a,
fn.
3b The distinction of gender in the subjunctive is confined to Takestani. Notice that
in this dialect the endings of the 3rd person singular of the present and the subjunctive
are the same; v. § 304.

                    si biaria ‘[that] she marries’

                    ava verita, bekata‘ she ran, fell’

                    ava dastesa mumia/mivnta ‘she was coming/running’
d) Perfect,
           Tak.     em xeyli berbenesti ‘he has wept much’
                    ema meyli berbenestia ‘she has wept much’
                    a veriti ‘he has run’
                    ava veritia ‘she has run’
e) Pluperfect,
           Tak.     az bumayma Hasan berasasta ve ‘when I came H. had
                    [already] arrived’
                    az bumayma Zeynaba berasasta via ‘when I came Z. had
                    [already] arrived’
/) Takestani does not mark the gender in past transitive verbs, e.g.
           Tak.     vac(c)e ‘he/she said’
                    dast-es(e) ‘he/she had’
                                     4. Eshtehardi278. Eshtehardi distinguishes the gender in the 3rd person singular of
the tenses built with the past stem, i.e., the preterit, the imperfect, the
perfect, and the pluperfect.          The present of the substantive verb also
distinguishes the gender in the singular.
  For gender distinction in the passive constructions in Eshtehardi, v.
below and § 333. Examples:
  a) Present of the substantive verb,
           Esh.     az-ima/az-eyma ‘I am (m., f.)’
                    tb-isa / td-eysa ‘thou art (m., f.)’
                    a ya / a yi ‘he/she is’37
b) Preterit and imperfect,37 In the following example, buat-es-ia enda da bem/bemd ta a bay ‘he has said that I
should be (m., f.) here until he comes’, bema was given by Sadeqi with some hesitation
as the feminine of bem, 1st person singular subjunctive of ‘to be’, whereas bi was given
as both the masculine and feminine of the 3rd person singular. Again, Sadeqi thought
that camd-ymun-a rather than cama-ymun ‘we are’ would be used by a group of women.
The latter was given on other occasions, however, for both masculine and feminine.
Cf. §§ 216; 275-6, e, fn. 1; 277, a, fn. 2.
 200                                 MORPHOLOGY              Esh.    a buast / a buasta ‘he/she ran’
                      a mivast / a mivasta ‘he/she used to run’
 c) Perfect,
              Esh.    sir berenjesta ‘the milk has spilled’
                      aw a (f.) berenjesti ‘water has spilled’
 Note:
   According to a paradigm given by Sadeqi, the gender is marked in all persons, except
 the 3rd person plural, of the preterit and perfect of the substantive verb, e.g.
      az beym/bieym ‘I was (m., f.)’, etc., v. § 356
      az beyma/bieyma ‘I have been (m., f.)’, etc., v. § 357
 In my materials marking of gender in the plural verbs is confined to this paradigm.d) Pluperfect (gender is marked in both the verb and the auxiliary),
           Esh.      a buast bu ‘he had run’
                     a buasta bia ‘she had run’
               (also mivast bu / mivasta bia ‘he / she had been running’)
e) In past transitive verbs, i.e., in a passive construction, the verbal
element generally agrees with the logical direct object in Eshtehardi, e.g.
         Esh. ji fur-es beza ‘he beat his son’
                 ji tetia-s bezia ‘he beat his daughter’

"                      E. PROBLEMS OF PHONEMIZATION
Southern Tati dialects are not stabilized by any traditional or literary
records, and they abound in flexible forms, permissible foreign usages,
and variant features.         The extent of the variation in pronunciation32 V. pp. 29, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 45, 47; Chal, Esfarvarin, Danesfan, and Siadohon
(Takestan) are specified in this respect.

Taqizadeh (London, 1962), p. 240 ff.
34 E.g. Ram. *meja (33) ‘eyelash’, *calaqa (47) ‘sparrow’; Xia. mijia, calaqa. Such
differences occur, however, mainly in the supplementary section which may belong to
a different district of Xiaraj. Notice, for instance, Ram. *undi, *undiun (62 ff.; also
recorded by A.A. 70-71 for Sagz-abadi) ‘he’, ‘they’, *anno (54) ‘now’, *emago ayago
(58) ‘here and there’, *dmireste (73) ‘he stands’, *dmriStay (73) ‘he is standing’, but Xia.

                                INTRODUCTION                                   27among different speakers35 or by the same speaker, which results in a wide
range for most of the vowels, makes the determination of the phonemic
membership a task which requires much careful study. In addition, the
possible influence of Persian or Turkish on the commonly trilingual
Tati-speakers, as in the rounding of e similar to that in the speech of the
Qazvinis, as well as a tendency to harmonize the vowels, add to the
difficulty of the problem. These problems can be surmounted only by
access to extensive dialect materials. As the requisite amount of material
was not always available, the phonemic system presented here must, of
necessity, be considered tentative. In cases of doubt I have allowed for
variations of pronunciation in my otherwise phonemic transcription,
rather than deciding on a phoneme without sufficient grounds.36 Further¬
more, when occurrences of a given word with an assimilated sound are
infrequent, so that the phonemic nature of the sound may not be accura¬
tely deduced, a phonetic transcription has been preferred to a doubtful
phonemic one. Thus, Xoz. bo-xoras ‘that you (sg.) eat’ and Xia. db-roj
‘sweep!’ are transcribed as such even though the sounds which are
transcribed as o in bo- and 6 in do- might be allophones of -e.
  Frequent dropping of final consonants (§ 79) presents another problem.
To decide whether Tak. ya or yard ‘(he) did’ is standard form is not dis¬
similar to deciding whether in spoken Persian e or ast ‘is’ is to be taken as
the standard form. In such cases the forms have been given as heard.
  It goes without saying that further investigation is required to deter¬
mine details of phonology in the dialects and their subdivisions. For the
above reasons, phonological remarks, except for Chali, Takestani, and
Eshtehardi, for which more substantial materials were available, have
been kept to a minimum.","[28, 29]"
"1 ‘Aziz Taheri and Ahmad Taheri. A. Rahmani had also [a'ya] ‘there’ alternating
with [a'ga], but always [en'ga] ‘here’. Whether q in qa5a ‘bite’ belongs to g needs
further investigation.
                                  TAKESTAN1                              41          direm [di'rom, dirom] ‘that I have’
          macem ['matjom, 'matjom] ‘my kiss’
(but ['berujem] ‘that I buy’, [aegerem] ‘that I take’). Rounding of e may
occur as a result of assimilation, e.g.
          [be'Jo, bo Jo] ‘he went’
          [do'so] ‘two or three’ ([se] ‘three’)
In other cases the variation seems to be the result of a general tendency
to round e, e.g.
          cader [tja'der, tja'dor] ‘tent’ (cf. § 27 fn.)
40. 6 (v. § 29) is [o] or [b]. With some speakers it assumes a somewhat
closer articulation before m, e.g.
          piom ['pijom] ‘my father’
41. a (v. § 30) has a range between [ae] and [e]. It is more open when
stressed, e.g.
          asra [ 'aesrs] ‘tear’
In final position and after y, if unstressed, it is generally [c] or [e] and
occasionally even higher, but is not confused with e, e.g.
           tan ya ['t‘aen js] ‘he put on (the clothes)’
         vara [ 'vaers] ‘snow’
In rapid speech final unstressed a has a more relaxed articulation and
occasionally sounds like [a].      For change of the unstressed -a into -a
before some enclitic pronouns, v. § 113.
  42. a (v. § 31) is an open back vowel with more neutral lip position
than the cardinal [a].
  43. o (v. § 32) is normally an open back vowel [o] or [o]. In Takestani
it has no diphthongal character and is shorter than Chali 6, e.g.
           more [mo're] ‘he brings’
           kotar [kco'tca2r] ‘pigeon’
         soz [soz] ‘green’
Before a nasal it shows a wide range and may be slightly more open, or
more closed and rounded to the extent of becoming confused with u, e.g.
           bon [bon, bon, bon] ‘roof’
           boma [bo'mae, bo'mae, bu'mae] ‘he came’
In final position -on is often reduced to a nasalized o [on, on, on].
  44. u (v. § 33) is somewhat less close than Chali u. As in Chali, it is
centralized, but to a lesser degree, before a and a, e.g.
           kua [kiilwae] ‘heap’
           ruan [ru'waen] ‘ghee’
           duazza [diiwaez'zae] ‘twelve’
          jua [d3Ulwa] ‘separate’
42                               PHONOLOGY[u] occurs, however, also in the following words:
         vu(y)a [ lviiCj)£e] ‘water’ (in various contexts)
         zu [zu] ‘howling’ (in a lexical list)
For the homorganic treatment of the nasals before a consonant, v. § 290.
                               III. eshtehArdi
45. The consonant phonemes of Eshtehardi are parallel to those of
Chali (v. § 2 ff.), except for the absence of xw, as is the case in Takestani
(see also § 49). The vowel phonemes of Eshtehardi are parallel to those
of Takestani (v. § 34).
  46. xw (v. § 15) coalesces with x.
           xaka [ 'xak'ae] ‘sister’
47. (z) (v. § 10) does not occur in my materials. The words for eighteen
and nineteen are hejda and nujda. z does not occur in Zhukowsky’s
material either, except for the borrowed ezdeha ‘dragon’ {Mat. II, 337a);
cf. mojda (ibid., 337a) ‘tiding’.
  48. n (v. § 19) normally has a weak articulation in final position after
u, and may be no more than a nasalizing agent, e.g.
           mikarun [mik'ae'ru] ‘we do’
49. (vr) The labio-dental v has a bilabial allophone [w] which occurs,
in the available material, only after d, o, and a, e.g.
          gow ‘ox’
           soxvz ‘green’
          jowajar ‘barley field’
           qowwat ‘strength’
         awa ‘water’
cf. miva ‘vine’, xava ‘co-wife’, emvaze ‘he runs’, qazvin ‘Qazvin’, veyd
‘wedding’.1
  50. e (v. §§ 27, 39) is [e] or somewhat closer [e]. Unstressed e before
n approaches [i], e.g.
           enda [in 'da] ‘here’
1 There were personal differences in the pronunciation of v among my informants.
A'lami had bavard and qovvat, with a weakly articulated v for Qajargir’s baward and
qowwat. Further investigation is needed to delimit the occurrence of [w] and decide
its status as an allophone or phoneme. I shall indicate its occurrence in my transcrip¬
tion of Eshtehardi and the other dialects.
44                                PHONOLOGY Rounding of e occurs in Eshtehardi as it does in Takestani (v. § 39),
 particularly in the vicinity of the labials. But the rounding is generally
 of a lesser degree, e.g.
           se [sa, s?] ‘three’
           bexarem ['baxarsm] ‘that I eat’
           cemen [tja'man] ‘me, mine’
51. o [o] (v. § 43) has a rather limited occurrence in Eshtehardi, appearing
mainly after x and in some loan-words, e.g.
           arxoten ‘to sleep’
           xoda ‘god’                     xosna ‘self’
           xola ‘ash’                     doxorest ‘destroyed’
           xorus ‘cock'                  xordek ‘small’
           orosi ‘shoe’                   xolasa ‘in short’
o does not appear before n, and was only noticed before w in qowwat.
(The round vowel appearing before n is always u, and before w, generally
d.)
52. u [u] (v. § 33) has a more advanced and less rounded allophone [ii]
which occurs when u precedes i, e.g.
           yuin [jii lwin] ‘(corn) field’
           buindem [bulwindam] ‘I saw’
[ii] occurred also in the following words in the speech of Qajargir in
environments which do not allow any definite conclusions as to the rule
for its occurrence, if [ii] is to be treated as an allophone of u: [djiip'ga]
‘bull calf’, [k'iit'] ‘heap’, [mii'tjmae] ‘ant’, [suwae'min] ‘third’, ['giistcem]
‘I wanted’.
  Further investigation is needed to decide whether more than an
optional centralizing of u is involved.
                                    IV. XIARAJI
53. The phonetic system of Xiaraji is parallel to that of Takestani,
except for (w) (v. § 54) and for the occurrence of xw (v. § 15), attested in
the following:
           bexwa ‘he ate’
           naxwas ‘sick’
The labial element is, however, weak and occasionally disappears.
  54. (w) [w] (v. §§ 23, 49) has a restricted occurrence. It does not
occur initially, and was attested only after a, o, and 6, e.g.
           awyar ‘water-distributor’
           baw ‘bring!’
           dawij ‘weave!’
           awambar ‘water reservoir’
           migow ‘must’
           kowa ‘blue, blue grey’
w does not stand in contrast to v and is probably an allophone of it
(cf. § 49, fn.).
  54a. Before a nasal, the unstressed -a generally becomes more closed
[s, s], e.g.
           beza-m [-S-] ‘my goat’
           ia-ni [-8-] ‘one (f.) too’
55. The Xiaraji phonemes which are typical of several dialects are given
below for easier reference:
consonants:        p    t      c        k         (P)
                   b    d     j         g   <1
                   f    *     s             x, xw h

For description of the phonemes v. §§ 3-33.
                                  V. EBRAHIM-ABADI
    56. Of my two chief informants, B. Dana’i belonged to the Upper
    District and N. Dana’i to the Lower District in Ebrahim-abad. Their
    speech was somewhat different (v. pp. 23-4).
      The consonantal phonemes of Ebrahim-abadi are identical with those
    of Xiaraji (v. § 55), except that xw was not attested in the speech of B.
    Dana’i. It occurred in N. Dana’i’s speech in bexwa ‘ate’ and in some
    other derivatives of the same verb.1
      57. The vowel phonemes of the Upper District sub-dialect are:
                                     i                      u
                                           e                o
                                          (e)
                                                 a          a
    58. e tends to become neutral [o] in the vicinity of the labials, e.g.
             ['bogs] ‘take!’
              [gaen'dom] ‘wheat’
              [•p^stbwids] ‘peel!’
59. o has a range between [o] and [u]. Further study is needed to decide
whether o and 6 are two different phonemes. In my material they do not
stand in contrast and often alternate, e.g.
              xod [xod, xod] ‘self’
60. e (cf. § 28) is [s(0] and may be taken as a diphthong with a reduced
form: [s]. e was not always clearly distinguishable from e in the speech
of B. Dana’i, although he was always clear as to which of the two was
present. He characterized e as fatha and e as kasra (cf. § 28, fn.). The
following pair stand in contrast:
              bem ‘I am’
              bem ‘(that) I come’.
The problem of whether e should be taken as a unit phoneme or be taken
1     But A.A., p. 145, records xuaka ‘sister’; cf. § 15.
48                                PHONOLOGYas a combination, as described in the case of Chali e (v. § 28), applies
equally here.
     Before a nasal, e corresponds to Chali 6, e.g.
            razen ‘gardens’ (Cha. razdri)
            zema ‘son-in-law’ (Cha. zoma)
In a number of cases e is the result of the contact between a and a spread
front vowel, e.g.
           naxose ‘she is ill’ < naxosa + e
           besiese ‘you (sg.) have gone’ < besia -f- isa
61. In the dialect of N. Dana’i of the Lower District the vowel phonemes
were:
           i, e, a, a, 6, o, u
           d is [o(w)j (cf. § 32) and generally corresponds to e of the Upper
District before a nasal:
           mon ‘middle’
           boma ‘(that) I come’
In other cases e of the Upper District was replaced by ey in the speech of
N. Dana’i.
                                VI. sagz-abAdx
62. The phonemic system of Sagz-abadi is parallel to that of Xiaraji. The
realization of some of the phonemes, however, is different.
    In the consonants the chief difference between Sagz-abadi1 and the
other Tati dialects is that k and g have a very advanced articulation and
often fall together with the affricates c and j [tj, d3], e.g.
            car ‘work5
            xaca ‘sister5
            da ‘house5
            cu ‘from5
            lenja ‘one of a pair5
            mejow ‘must5
            ujir ‘lift!5
k preceded by s, however, preserves a velar pronunciation: beskiast
‘broke’, and at least two words — gujil ‘small’ and agar ‘if’ — always
appear in my material with g.
  In the speech of Maleki of the Qala district, k and g had palatal articu¬
lation but only occasionally merged with c and j.
    63. xw was attested, as in Ebrahim-abadi, only in the verb xwardan.z
Even in this case labialization is faint and occasionally absent.
    64. 6 is [0], e.g.
            meso ‘he was going’
         so ‘three5
Generally, 0 does not occur before w, but o does, e.g.
            owa ‘water5
           yoxv ‘barley5
            sowz ‘green5
            mejow ‘must5
1   As spoken in the district of Mon Qala.
2   A.A., p. 145, however, records: xuaca ‘sister’ but buxardan ‘to eat’.

          sezjowi ‘from Sagz-abad’3
65. o is [o] or [q] (cf. § 51):
          xoShal ‘happy’
          loqma ‘morsel’
except before -n where it has a wider range, between [o] and [zt] (cf. § 43).","[42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"

 238                                MORPHOLOGY                     2) Conjugation of Past Transitive Verbs    334. The various past tenses of transitive verbs have but one basic form
 each, built in the same way as the third person singular of the correspond¬
 ing tense of an intransitive verb. When enclitic pronouns are suffixed to
 these forms as agents (v. §§ 222, 333), a series of paradigms is obtained
 which resembles a verbal conjugation in that the verbal sense and the
 logical subject (the agent) are both indicated,101 e.g.
                          Cha.            Esh.                  Ebr.
                  I saw, etc.   I ate, etc.      I bought, etc.
           sg. 1. bind-em (B-A) be-xard-em (B-A) berxi-em (B-A)
                  2. bind-i          be-xard-i             berxi-i
               3. bind-es            be-xard-es            berxi-es
           pi. 1. bind-emo           be-xard-emun         berxi-men
               2. bined-eyo          be-xard-iun          berxi-en
               3. bind-eso           be-xard-esun         berxi-sen
Such paradigms, however, differ basically from those of an intransitive
verb conjugation in that:
   a) the endings (i.e., suffixed pronouns) may be omitted if the agent is
expressed by a noun or an independent pronoun (v. §§ 224, 332).
   b) the endings may be suffixed to a different part of the sentence (v.
§ 224); and
   c) the verb does not agree with its logical subject (the agent), but gener¬
ally has a fixed form. (The original agreement of the verb with its logical
direct object is preserved to some extent only in Eshtehardi, v. § 333.)
   Cf. the following examples:
           Esh.     azira cemen bademjun bexdrd ‘yesterday I ate eggplant’
                    azira bddemjun-em bexdrd ‘yesterday I ate eggplant’
                azira bademjun bexard-em ‘yesterday I ate eggplant’
Thus, the above paradigms of the transitive preterit may also be given as:
                    sg- 1-          sg. 2.                Sg. 3.

24                                INTRODUCTIONIn Ebrahim-abadi, the sub-dialect of the Lower District24 has on and dm
(< an and dm, v. § 60) for the Upper District’s25 en and <?m.26 Again, in
the Qale District of the same village are found laqqe ‘branch’ and fe ‘was'
as against belazqe and bef, respectively, in the other three districts of the
village.
   Such nuances account for a number of apparent inconsistencies in
spelling found in the examples quoted from the same dialect. Reference
has been made in the footnotes to such discrepancies in so far as it has
been possible to study them.
  A second type of variation in each dialect results from the development
in time rather than the difference in place: the speech of the older gene¬
ration has occasionally preserved more archaic aspects of the dialect.
For example, in Esfarvarini the phrase xakaron-es-a ‘of his sisters’ was
given as an “old-fashioned” form of xakon-es-a (§ 134ff.) and apers-a
‘ask ye’, a good Tati word, as a form used by “old women” for the current
aval a-gir-a. In Eshtehardi, ia, the feminine of i ‘one’ (v. § 212), was still
used by my informants of advanced age, while only i was used by my
younger informants, xaka ‘sister’ is becoming more and more obsolete
in Eshtehardi and Esfarvarini, being replaced in Eshtehardi by bajia and
in Esfarvarini by dada.
     In Ebrahim-abadi the use of the oblique case for the agent (§§ 153,
331 ff.) was found to be more common among the older than the younger
generation. It is interesting to note that the agential pronoun men ‘I’,
now lost to Xiaraji, occurs in the poems of Mira Kuru of that village.27
Generally the distinction of the feminine gender was found to be more
consistent in the speech of the older generations.28 As a rule, the general
tendency of the development of the dialects may be said to favor the
simplification and levelling of forms and the shedding of case and gender
distinctions.","[25, 26]"

                      Ebr., Sag.), xosten (Esf.).
 In my Chali and Ebrahim-abadi examples, xdd and xod appear only as
 subject and agent, whereas xostan, etc., which is used as both a pronoun
 and an adjective, appears in the oblique functions. In Takestani there
 occurs an oblique form of xostan in -ar (cf. § 138, n.).48 Generally, re¬
 flexive pronouns are followed by an enclitic pronoun which indicates the
 person referred to. Examples:
   a) xdd, xod,
    i. as subject,
            Cha.     xod-em besem ‘I went myself’
            Ebr.     a xod-em miem ‘I come myself’
                     ama xod-emen miayem ‘we come ourselves’
 ii. as agent,
            Cha.     xod-em bat ‘I myself said’
                     xod-es bind ‘he himself saw’
          Ebr. xod-em bindem ‘I myself saw’
 b) xostan, etc.,

           Xia.      cemen xostan hambera beba ‘take me along with [you]

                     ma xostan-em meraz-e ‘this is my own clothing’
                     ma xostan-emen quc-e ‘this is our own ram’
           Sag.      xostan-emun-a semsir nemezanam (111) ‘we are not
                     fighting for ourselves’
           Esf.      cemen xosten-i hambera beba ‘take me along with you
                     yourself’
48 Examples are not sufficient for ascertaining the exact rules governing the use of the
two types. It appears that xdd/xod is only a pronoun, whereas xoStan, etc., is basically
a noun, used also as a pronoun. The oblique in -r occurs only when the word is used
as a pronoun.

                              A. PERSONAL PRONOUNS213. Personal pronouns are divided into the independent and the enclitic.
The latter have but one form. The former, on the other hand, have at least
two forms: direct and oblique. Chali has preserved an agential set of
pronouns, which appear to have been used earlier in some other dialects
also; v. § 219. Independent pronouns generally distinguish the gender in
the 3rd person singular.1                              1. Direct Personal Pronouns214. The direct forms of personal pronouns (cf. Reseda, 63 ff.; A. A., 171)
are:
            I          thee    he        she       we          you           they
Cha.        az         ta      a         aya      dm a         soma          ay
Tak.        a(z)       ta      d(v)      dva      ama          soma          and

Xia.        a          ta      a         a        ama          soma          ahay{n)
Ebr.        a          ta      a         a        ama          soma          alien
Sag.        a(z)       ta      a         aya      ama          semd          ahayn
Dan.        az         ta      d        a         ama          soma          ayn
Esf.        az        ta       a        aya        ama         soma          ayend, ayn
Xoz.        az        ta       a        aya       ama          soma          aha
The 3rd person singular pronouns are the same as the remote demon¬
strative pronouns. Frequently, approximate demonstrative pronouns are
also used for the 3rd person personal pronouns (v. § 228 ff.). Feminine
pronouns generally follow the pattern of feminine nouns and end in an
unstressed -a when they have more than one syllable; cf. § 92.
Notes:
    1. Ur person singular - In Takestani and Sagz-abadi -z generally appears when thei
    Not, however, in the direct case in Xia., Ebr., and Dan. V. below §§ 236, 238, 242.
148                                  MORPHOLOGYpronoun is followed by a vowel, and only in careful speech before a consonant.
   2. 3rd person singular - Chali ai given by Sot. in Resala, 63, for ‘he’ must be a
mistake; cf. ibid., 64-66, where he regularly has a.
   In Takestani the v of a{v) appears in careful speech or when followed by a vowel, e.g.
dv-i da mume ‘he comes, too.’ un, which is occasionally used for ‘he, that’, must be a
borrowing from Persian an, un.
   In Xiaraji and Ebrahim-abadi the feminine and masculine are alike, e.g.
            Xia. a bekat, a bekatay ‘he fell, he has fallen’
                    a bekata, a bekati ‘she fell, she has fallen’
            Ebr. a bese sa: r ‘he went to town’
                   a besia sa: r ‘she went to town’
   No examples of Sagz-abadi aya are found in A. A. material. Cf.
            Sag. a mevaze ‘he runs’
                   aya mevazia ‘she runs’
   3. 1st person plural - Only Eshtehardi among the dialects uses an oblique form:
           Esh. camd ji miomun ‘we come, too’
   4. 2nd person plural - Takestani occasionally uses the double plural soma-y-un,
formed by the nominal plural morpheme -un, preceded by a glide. In like manner,
Eshtehardi occasionally uses sema-ha, as in colloquial Persian, possibly under the
influence of aha ‘they’ and the direct plural morpheme - eha. The -e- in Esh. sema has a
somewhat neutral lip position.
   5. 3rd person plural - In Xiaraji the final -n tends to be dropped, generally leaving a
nasal trace. Occasionally, a faint -e- appears after y :ahdye(n). This is also exactly the
case in Sagz-abadi (cf. A. A., 171, where aha and ahayen are both given).
   In Esfarvarini, of my two informants ‘Amu’i regularly used ayend, e.g.
            Esf.   ayend besiand ‘they went’,
                   ayend nun-eso bexord ‘they ate bread’
whereas Mehr ‘Alian used ayn, e.g.
            Esf.   ayn bomianda ‘they came’,
                   ayn bindeso ‘they saw’.","[148, 149, 150]"
"305. In Takestani and Sagz-abadi, if the verbal stem ends in a vowel, a
connective glide -y- is sometimes inserted before the vowel of the ending
(v. § 75).        The more general rule, however, is for the two vowels to
coaslesce. In Tak. double forms are thus sometimes produced; cf.
         Tak. be-di/be-da-y-e ‘[that] he give’
                          be/be-y-e ‘he be’
                          be-som/be-sa-y-om ‘[that] we go’
                Cf. also Sag. b-a-y-em (109) ‘[that] I come’

     307. The subjunctive is also used as conditional present. When it is
thus employed, the stress is generally shifted from the prefix be- or the
preverb or the non-verbal component in a compound verb to the ending
(v. §§ 84-86), e.g.
                Cha.     aga az bettajem pdm miski ‘if I run my foot will break’
                Esh.     agar buazem pd-m meske ‘if I run my foot will break’
                Ebr.     aga bevazem pd-m meskie ‘if I run my foot will break’
                         agar jagu basa ji mivinis ‘should you (sg.) be there, you
                         will see him’
308. The injunctive. — In Takestani and Sagz-abadi the following
examples of the 2nd person singular of the subjunctive occur with an
imperative force:
                Tak.     jave ra nevaji ‘don’t tell him’, ‘make sure not to tell him’
                         bezunas ce te ra xara car-im car da (97) ‘know that I
                         have done you a good turn’
                         huski ra mevajas (93) ‘don’t tell anyone’
d) The Optative309. The optative is formed like the subjunctive (§ 304 fif.) except that
the 3rd person singular ending is -d.72 Examples:72   Some speakers, however, notably in Takestani, used the subjunctive instead of the

optative. Javad Taheri of Takestan did not use the optative at all. Notice the following
Chali verse, where the subjunctive is used instead of the optative:
            Cha. sare qabrem gia ruide gardi
                   becarrind do sad gav o xar o mis
                   ‘may grass grow on my grave
                   [and] may two hundred cows, donkeys and ewes graze [it]’
Cf. also: Tak. xoda mobarak kare ‘may God make [it] auspicious’.
73 Cf. Persian key bdsad ‘when would it be, may the time come’.
74 Sag. bebarsh (sic) in mardasu dimi bebarsh, A. A., 127, must be a printing mistake
for bebaras. vasa in dadam vasa (126) dadi vasa (126) translated as ‘my father burnt’,
‘your father burnt’ is to all appearances a 3rd pers. sing, optative ‘may burn’, unless it is
the vestige of an older 3rd pers. sing, of the preterit in -ad'l (Henning).
76 This form may be due to the influence of Persian. The Xiaraji subjunctive would be
kari (v. § 304).

In Eshtehardi, however, a progressive present is formed by the present
indicative of a verb followed by:
           sg. 1. kdrdarim{a)76
           sg. 2. kdrdaris(a)
           sg. 3. kdrdar-al-i (m., f.)
           pi. 1. kdrdarimun{a)
           pi. 2. kdrdaray
           pi. 3. kdrdarend(a)
E.g.
                    mi-vazem kdrdarima ‘I am running’
                    mi-si kSrdari ‘she is going’
                    mi-kowe kdrdara ‘it is falling’
311. In Chali a progressive present is formed by the infinitive, or a verbal
noun expressing the sense of an infinitive, followed by a locative post¬
position («, (e)ndu) and then the present of the substantive verb, e.g.
           Cha.     esta tete xordan-u-ind ‘your daughters are eating’
                    vastemon-u-ind ‘they are dancing’
                    vazi-ndu-ind ‘they are playing’
                    Hasane teta zaymon-u-ya ‘Hasan’s daughter is giving
                    birth’
312. In Ebrahim-abadi the use of the word kara implies not a pro¬
gressive present, but the imminence of an action or a state; it can be
used with both a present and a past tense, e.g.
           Ebr.     vela kara m-a-karia ‘the flower (f.) is going to open’
                    vela kara m-a-kariasta ‘the flower was going to open’
                         3. Tenses built on the Past Stem                              a) The Intransitive Verbs1) The Preterit
  313. The preterit of intransitive verbs is formed with the past stem76 kar- in Qajargir’s speech and kar in Sadeqi’s. The auxiliary may be analyzed as
kar-da- followed by the present of the substantive verb (v. § 350, c). Notice, however,
that the 2nd person plural of the substantive verb is is in, whereas the normal ending for
the 2nd person plural of the present is -dy. For kar- cf. the similar use of kerd in Shali
(Khalkhal) and Shandermani (Talesh) (BSOAS, XXII, 1, 1959. pp. 60, 62) and kore in
Kajali {Ibid., XXIII, 2, 1960, p. 282). da is in ail probability the postposition -da ‘in’

 For the euphonic -a/-e which follows some of the endings, v. § 298 ff.
   For stress pattern, v. § 84, c.
 For feminine forms of the preterit, v. §§ 269, 270.
Notes:
   1. Except for the 3rd person singular which, takes no ending, the preterit endings
are the same as the enclitic forms of the present of the substantive verb (§ 348). There¬
fore, strictly speaking, the preterit and the imperfect, which have the same endings, are
periphrastic tenses.
  2. sg. 1. The vowel of the ending has a range between e and i and varies sometimes
according to the speaker (cf. §§ 27, 39).
   3. sg. 2. In Sag. best ‘you went’ and umiey ‘you came’, which occur in A. A., 175,
 176, the ending appears as -/ (?).
   4. sg. 3. For Tak. ending -c, adopted from transitive verbs, v. §§ 225, 335, n. 1.
   5. pi. 1. The vowel before -m- generally has a range between i and e (cf. §§ 27, 39).
   Ramandi generally uses -um, the ending of the present, -mun, however, which agrees
with the 1st person plural ending of the preterit in the other dialects, appears in *vi-muri
(65) we were’, and in *ne-\i-mun (66) ‘we were not’. In Cha. -n appears before a vowel
if no pause intervenes.
  6. pi. 2. Esh. -isin, probably built on the 2nd person singular ending -is, is unique
among the dialects.","[224, 225, 226, 227, 228]"
"8   Rounding of e was not observed, however, in the ending of the masculine singular
oblique or the plural direct case (both unstressed -e). Since the phonetic circumstances
for the variation are not yet defined, I shall transcribe e when [e] alternates with
[0], in Chali as well as in the other dialects.
9 Ameli, one of my two chief Chali informants, always distinguished between e and
e by calling the former a kasra and the latter a fatha. This did not mean, however,
that e sounded like a, even though in the majority of cases e is the result of an a preceding
e or / in sandhi (v. § 81, b, d). It meant that e ended with the y glide, and this, according
to his old-fashioned training in Arabic grammar and its conventions, could not, there¬
fore, be called a kasra.
10 In all the other dialects, except Ebrahim-abadi, the more economical combination
ey gave a better picture of the corresponding sound, and was therefore adopted. In
rapid speech e was particularly noticed in Xiaraji, Sagz-abadi, and Danesfani, e.g.
Xia. pevrey [p'ev're:], obi. of pevrd ‘boy’; Sag. cieyn [tjilje:n], pi. obi. of cia ‘house’;
Dan. vieyma [viIJe:mae] ‘I have been’. In these dialects I have taken [e:] as an allo-
phone of ey, which is closer than e: to the common articulation.
 38                                    PHONOLOGY             maya-s ['majsj] ‘his mother’
             barra-s [ 'baerrej] ‘his spade’
             maya-je-s [ 'majsdjeJ] ‘his mother too’
      .
31 a is an open vowel less retracted than the cardinal [a] and with
more neutral lip-rounding [a], e.g.
             bates [ 'brtt'ej] ‘he said’
a does not appear before a nasal, except occasionally in affected speech
as a substitute for 6 (v. § 32).
      In the following instances the final -a of a noun followed by s or y has
a strongly palatalized pronunciation, approaching e (§ 28) or e:
            bena-s yard [ben'§:J] ‘he began’
            pilla bera-s [ber^rj, beraj] rayyati miare ‘his elder brother
            practices farming’
            a:ya-ye [ae: 'j?:je] ‘it is a vigil’
   .
32 6 is a rounded back vowel, generally with an increase of lip-rounding
at the end which gives it a diphthongal character [ow]. When [w] is
omitted, as frequently happens in rapid speech, it leaves a trace in
length [o.] (cf. § 27), e.g.
            xola [ 'xo^ae] ‘ash’
            vona [vow 'nae] ‘pretext’
            naxds [na'xowJ] ‘sick’
            md(n) ['mo^n)] ‘middle’
6 occurs mainly before nasals corresponding to Persian -an, -dm, e.g.
         bon ‘roof’
            boma ‘he came’
It occurs in final position mostly when a nasal has been omitted (v. also
§ 81, c), e.g.
            -sd(n) ‘theirs’
            zaro(n) ‘children’
Since neither of the two elements of [ow] occurs independently in the
dialect, the combination is treated here as a unit phoneme.11 Occasional
optional replacing of o by o' or « before -n, probably due to affectation,
occurs, e.g.
            silonaka, silunaka ‘apricot’
            poron, porun ‘front’
            cupon, cupun, cupan ‘shepherd’11 In a number of corresponding cases the other dialects have ow. Before a nasal the
corresponding sound in the other dialects, except Ebrahim-abadi (v. §§ 60, 61), is a
monophthong (o or u) (cf. § 28).
                                    CHALI                                3933. u is a close rounded back vowel [u]. It has a more advanced, less
rounded, and closer allophone [u], appearing immediately before a, i,
and a, e.g.
        du [du] ‘buttermilk’, duina [diilwinae] ‘made with buttermilk’
        cu [tju] ‘wood’, cuina [tjiilwin£e] ‘wooden’
        basua [bae lsiiwae] ‘earthen jar’
        ruaza [ruwae'3a] ‘grandson’
        duanden [duw2en'den] ‘to pour in’
        buanden [biiwaen 'den] ‘to throw out’
        jua [d3iilwa] ‘separate’
        suar [su lwar] ‘horseman’
                                  II. tAkestAni
34. The Takestani consonant phonemes are parallel to those of Chali
(v. § 2 ff.), except for the absence of the labialized post-velar fricative
xw (v. § 15). The Takestani vowel phonemes are:
                              i                          u
                                     e       6       o
                                         a       a
35. g (v. § 7) has an especially retracted articulation when preceded and
followed by o. Two of my informants1 regularly had [y] in this position,
e.g.
          [mo'yo] ‘must’
          [oyo 'rem] ‘that I lift’
          [mo'yosfem] ‘I wanted’
          [oyor'daen] ‘to lift’
36. Where Chali has xw (v. § 15), Takestani has x, e.g.
          xdka ‘sister’
          xor ‘good’
37. (z) (v. § 10) was noted only in ezdeha ‘dragon’.
38. i (v. § 26) is articulated like the Chali i.
39. e (v. § 27) is more open than the cardinal [e] in stressed position,
e.g.
          ['x§m(n)] ‘blood’
          [f§l] ‘money’
          [be'x^ntje] ‘he read’
Unstressed e before m is in free variation among some speakers with a
more rounded and more central allophone [?, a, 6] and, as such, may be
confused with d, e.g.","[39, 40, 41, 42]"

intonation accent.

  319. The subjunctive perfect is commonly formed from the past
participle (§ 353) of the main verb and the present subjunctive of ‘to be’
(§ 343; v. § 320 for the Sagz-abadi formation).
  Example of conjugation from Chali:
                       [that] I have come, etc.
          sg. 1. bomia bem                pi. 1. bamia bom
             2. bomia bas                      2. bomia ba
             3. bomia bi                       3. bomia bind
Examples:
          Tak.     i rev da dmrem bemanda be ‘even [if only] one day should
                   remain of my life’
          Esh.     buast91 bem, etc. ‘[that] I have run’, etc.
          Xia.     besi bema, etc. ‘[that] I have gone’, etc.
          Ebr.     bevasta bem, etc. ‘[that] I have run’, etc.
          Esf.     besia bem, etc. ‘[that] I have gone’, etc.
For the irreal conditional of intransitive verbs, however, the pluperfect is
often used, e.g.
          Tak.     agar bumia vima ‘if I should have come’
320. In Sagz-abadi, however, the personal endings of the preterit (§ 313)
are attached to the participle, which is then followed by the 3rd person
singular subjunctive of the auxiliary ‘to be’ (§ 353), e.g.
          Sag.     agar az besaym bi, ta beseys bi, ama beseymun bi, sema
                   besayd bi, ahayn besend bi xoda xodes mizune ‘if I, you,
                   we, you, they have gone, God himself would know [it]
                   (lit. knows)’
                   agar bekata bi xodes maje ‘if he has fallen, he himself
                   would tell [it] (lit. tells)’92
This formation, which is seen also in the pluperfect (§ 325), seems to be
modelled on the periphrastic tenses of transitive verbs (v. § 337).935) The Pluperfect
  321. Southern Tati dialects are relatively rich in varieties of the
91 V. § 322 for Esh. past participles as used in periphrastic tenses.
92 These forms are alt according to Maleki from the Quid District.
93 My material does not contain examples to show whether gender is marked in the
participial element of the subjunctive perfect.
     232                                  MORPHOLOGY     pluperfect, even though only the ‘common pluperfect’ is frequently used.
     The varieties differ from one another in their auxiliary, which may be a
     preterit, a perfect, a common pluperfect, or a progressive form of these.
       For the stress pattern, v. § 84, d.
       For distinction of gender in the pluperfect, v. §§ 269, 272.
       For the euphonic -a/-e which may follow some of the endings of the
     auxiliary, v. § 298.
 a) Common Pluperfect (I) 322. The common pluperfect of intransitive verbs is generally formed
 from the past participle (§ 258) of the main verb and the preterit of the
 auxiliary ‘to be’ (§ 355). In the 3rd person singular of Xiaraji, Ebrahim-
 abadi, and Sagz-abadi, the auxiliary is generally reduced to a devoiced
 -v or to -/. In Danesfani -v combines with the preceding vowel into -ow.94
    Examples of the conjugaton of the common pluperfect:                                  Cha.                 Tak.                 Ebr.","[232, 233, 234]"
"
5) Transitive Subjunctive Perfect
      339. The transitive subjunctive perfect consists of the past participle
of the verb (§ 343) and the subjunctive of the auxiliary ‘to be’ (§ 353).
Examples:
            Cha.    agar lotfi darda bi107 ‘if you (sg.) should have the kindness’
                    agar sake ... gavasa bi ‘if the king should want [it]’
            Esh.    agar hasar-i darund bi i toman esta midam ‘if you should
                    have swept the yard, I will give you one tuman’
                    agar awa (f.) bexard bi ‘if you should have drunk water’
            Xia.    agar az mahla jaru karda bi canda umidayl ‘how much
                    [would] you give me if I should have swept the yard?’
                    agar-i deruta bi ‘if you (sg.) should have swept ...’
            Sag.    agar az fel-em bedozdia bi ‘if I should have stolen the
                    money’
                    kesi yovin-a ne-barde-s bi ‘[lest] someone should have
                    robbed the harvest (lit. should not have robbed)’105   In the following Sagz-abadi examples, A. A., 93, the past stem is followed by -i:
            Sag. -i bar-award-iey ‘you (sg.) have taken off’
                   xott-iey ‘he is asleep (he has slept)’
It seems that these forms are affected by the example of the perfects in a vowel stem-
final, e.g.
            Sag. bar-siey (107) ‘he has gone up’
                   -m ne-diey (103, 105) ‘I have not seen’
                   -sun bezia (107) ‘they have struck’
Sag. uniayey (107) ‘he has placed’ appears to be a case of haplology.
10* -a following -S- must be the euphonic -a (v. §§ 298, 298a).
107 In this and the following example the verb actually has an intransitive sense:
W(0 darden ‘to be kind enough’; gavasen ‘to be inclined’. For this verb, v. § 362.
                                        VERBS                                       243          Dan.     aga az nun-em bexarda bi ma'lum a-m-be ‘if I should have
                   eaten bread it will become known’
6) Transitive Pluperfect (v. § 321 ff.)
  340. The transitive common pluperfect consists of the participle of the
verb (§ 343) and the preterit of the auxiliary ‘to be’ (§ 355). Other forms
of the pluperfect are built like the 3rd person singular of the corresponding
tense of the intransitive verb. When enclitic pronouns are attached to the
verb as the agent, they are generally attached to the past participle. In
Takestani examples, however, they are attached to the auxiliary. Exam¬
ples:
           Cha.    men as-em bepeta bu ‘I had cooked as’
                   unde-s bu ‘he had given’
                   kalley kid dar-eso yarda bu ‘they had hung him from the

                    cemen nun (m.) -em bexard bu ke zamin larza bebu ‘I had
                    eaten bread when the earthquake occurred’
                    cemen awa (f.) uxarda bia ke zamin-larza bebu T had drunk
                    water when the earthquake occurred’
           Xia.     a nun-em bexarda-f zamin-larza buma ‘I had eaten bread
                    when the earthquake occurred’ (v. § 355, n. 5)
                    Zeynaba raxtexab-es basia-f ‘Z. had spread the bed’
           Sag.     ... tofang-es ujirate bi (sic) (99) ‘he had picked up the
                rifle’ (v. § 355)
           Ram. *az gust-em bev, etc. (69) ‘1 had wanted’, etc.
           Dan.     az nun-em bexardow ke beram berasas ‘I had eaten bread
                    when my brother arrived’ (v. § 355, n. 4)
Notes:
   1. When the auxiliary -/, -v (§ 355, n. 5) ‘was’ is separated from the participle by an
enclitic pronoun, it assumes the fuller form bev, bef. Cf.
            Xia. a deruta-s bef ‘he had swept’
            but    a mahla-s deruta-f ‘he had swept the yard’.
   2. In Takestani, owing to the weakening of the passive construction (v. § 331 ff.), a
transitive pluperfect is occasionally conjugated like the intransitive (§ 322), e.g.
            Tak. add vis ‘you (sg.) had given’
                   add vi ‘he had given’ (but also add va vi-s)
 244                                MORPHOLOGY Examples from other forms of the transitive pluperfect:
 a) progressive pluperfect (v. § 326):
          Cha. agar non-emo darda mi-bu ‘if we had been having bread’
 b) quotational pluperfect (v. § 327):
          Dan. a nun-es bexarda viey ke beram berasas ‘he had eaten
                 bread when my brother arrived’
 c) remote pluperfect (v. § 329):
          Tak. ada va vi-s ‘you (sg.) had given’
                 ada va veysa ‘you (sg.) had given’ (v. § 355, n. 2)
                            G. PASSIVE FORMATION
     .
341 The passive voice of verbs is expressed by a secondary formation.
The passive present stem is generally obtained by adding the morpheme -i
to the active present stem of the verb. The past stem is then formed by
adding -ast (Cha. -as(s)) to the passive present stem. In Eshtehardi and
Esfarvarini the passive past stem is formed by adding -est (not -i-ast) to the
active present stem.108 The passive is conjugated as an intransitive verb.

    (Cf. Ram. pass. *benisiasta (70) ‘written’ (from the passive stem)
               act. *benvista (71) ‘written’ (from the active stem))108 All the examples I have from Esh. passive present are of the 3rd person singular
and end in -ey, as against the active which end in -a. V. below for instances.

342. The causative is expressed by a secondary formation. The present
stem of the causative is formed by adding one of the causative mor¬
phemes: en, ten/den,111 enden (v. below for their distribution) to the
present stem of the verb. The past stem is then formed by adding -as(s)
in Chali, -ast in Takestani, Xiaraji, Ebrahim-abadi, Sagz-abadi, Danes-
fani, and Xoznini, and -est in Eshtehardi to the causative present stem.
The causative is conjugated as the transitive verb.
   Of the causative morphemes, en was attested in all the dialects except
in Eshtehardi. It is the most frequent causative morpheme in Chali and
the only one used in the available Esfarvarini examples, ten/den (depend¬
ing on whether the stem-final is voiced or unvoiced) is the common109 Cf. Esh. misuja ‘it burns’, misujey ‘it is being burned’, misujendena ‘he burns,
makes burn’, misujendeney ‘it is being made to burn’.
110 Cf. Middle Pers. skih-, Jewish Pers. skihist, an old ancestry for the exception,
which proves that the passive forms derive from Old. Ir. -ya- passive: -ski- < *skadya\
-skenj- < *skatida. (Henning).
111 Possibly originally obtained through the metanalysis of causatives such as bexand-
en- ‘make laugh’, be-gard-en- ‘make turn’.

Notes:
   1. un occurs in the following from the vocabulary recorded by A. A.:
            Ebr.   a-gard-un-astan (136) ‘to make return’
            Sag.   a-jard-un-astan (136) ‘to make return’
            Ebr., Sag. be-tars-un-astan (140) ‘to frighten’
un was met only once in Takestani, interchanging with en in be-gard-un-astan ‘to make
turn’.
   2. Occasionally, alternative forms occur in the same dialect, e.g.
            Cha. biusen/biusenden ‘boil!’112
            Xia.   bettajen/bettajenden ‘make run!’
            Sag.   bexwaren/bexwarenden ‘make eat!, feed!’
            Dan. bevazen/bevazenden ‘make flee!’
   3. In Xiaraji enden was sometimes met in the imperative of a verb, but en in the
preterit of the same verb, e.g.
            Xia.   be-ttaj-enden ‘make run!’
                   be-ttaj-en-astem ‘I made run’
                   be-vas-enden ‘burn!’ (trans.)
                   be-vas-en-astem ‘I burned’ (trans.)
   4. Some verbs take the same causative morpheme in almost all the dialects, e.g. the
causatives of ‘to burn’ and ‘to laugh’ take en (Cha., etc., be-suj-en ‘make bum’; Cha.,
etc., be-xand-en ‘make laugh’), and the causative of ‘to weep’ takes enden:
            Cha. bermenden, Tak. bermanden ‘make weep!’
            Xia.   marmam-enden ‘don’t make weep’
            Ebr.   bebram-enden ‘make weep!’
            Sag.   bermam-enden-ast-es ‘he made weep’
            Dan. beram-enden ‘make weep!’Examples of the causative conjugation from Takestani:

                                       ‘to sleep’        ‘to put to bed’

112 Ameli, my chief Chali informant, thought that there were two causative forms in
Chali, one with en, the other with enden (which he considered ‘old-fashioned’). Occa¬
sionally, he saw, even though hesitatingly, some semantic distinction between the two
forms of the causative, e.g. betars-en-asen ‘to frighten, scare’, and betars-enden-asen
‘to frighten by a practical joke’; uverz-en-asen ‘to seat’ (in the sense of allowing or
ordering someone to sit down), and uverz-enden-asen ‘to seat’ (physically). He con¬
sidered buez-enden ‘make flee!’ a rather obsolete form and buazen more current. The
causative of Cha. baru{y)asen ‘to rain’ was given as barendenasen.

                                 I. VERBAL NOUNS
 343. Past participle. — The past participle is formed from the past stem
 of the verb (§ 258), the stressed suffix -a (which has a range between a and
 e), and if the stem is plain (v. § 257, n. 1) generally the prefix be-. With
 intransitive verbs the past participle has an active sense; with transitive
 verbs, a passive one. Examples:
            Cha.    be-pat-a ‘scattered’
                    u-pat-a ‘winnowed’
                    u-rot-a ‘swept’
                    u-yard-a ‘kindled’
                    be-sujas-a taryak arzon-e113 ‘burnt opium is cheap’
                    be-pacias-a ‘scattered’114
                    be-parras-a qus hani das mi-na ‘the bird that flew will not
                    be caught again (lit. flown bird will not come to hand
                    again)’
                    be-sujas-a saqa dard me-ne-xore ‘[a] burnt bough is no
                    good’
                    be-gozast-a dmr a-me-ne-garde ‘bygone times will not
                    return’
                    vanda-sanda ‘topsy turvy’115
                    a-pacias-a ‘tossed’
           Tak.     be-si-a ‘gone’
                   a-nist-a ‘seated’
                   a-xota ‘asleep’
                   b-ord-a ‘brought’
                   ey del be-gost-e fere ‘O beloved (lit. desired by heart)
                   boy!’
                   i saat nemarija besia ‘one hour passed after noon’
n3 Since an adjective, when followed by the modified, noun takes -a (v. § 204), this and
similar examples do not prove by themselves that the past participle ends in -a, but cf.
the adverbial use of the past participle in Tak. and Sag. examples, and also the use of
the past participle in the pluperfect, e.g.
            Cha. berasasa bu ‘he had arrived’
                   -s bexorda bu ‘he had eaten’
111 From the passive infinitive be-paciasen. This would be equivalent to the Pers.
double past participle pasida soda.
115 Lit., probably ‘thrown [around in an unorderly manner]’. For the first element cf.
Cha. buanden ‘to throw’, a-vanden ‘to spread in sunshine [to dry]’, va-van ‘[a fruit]
‘thrown by wind’, sanda may be related to the base -sin- ‘throw’ (Cha.,Xia. asinden;
Esh. ar-asinden ‘to throw’; Ebr. be-Sin-i-astan ‘to spill’) modified to rhyme with vanda
(but cf. Cha., Sag. (95) b-asi-a ‘thrown’).
                                         VERBS                                      251           Ebr.     be-vet-a ‘woven’
                    vata116 ‘said’
                    b-iusast-a ‘boiled’
                    be-rusiast-a jens ‘sold article[s]’
                    be-si-a dmr ‘bygone lifetime’
                    besujiasta zoqal ‘burnt charcoal’
            Sag.    araq-a-karda buma ‘he came sweating (lit. [having] made
                    sweat)’
                    bevasta, berasta buma ‘he came having run [and] parched’
            Xoz.    be-skiast-a yaga ‘the broken place’Notes:
   1. Cha. banjia, a kind of vermicelli made out of shredded wheat dough (Persian
resta), must be a past participle of banjanden ‘to cut’ (v. § 259, e).
  2. In the following Xiaraji and Ebrahim-abadi examples the past participle, followed
by the postposition -ra, is used with an infinitive sense:
           Ebr. miajenda ta Hasane dada bemid ra Hasan oxota fe ‘they say [that]
                   before H.’s father’s coming Hasan had gone to sleep’
                   miajenda ta Hasan berasasta ra ddzd besia fe ‘they say before H.’s
                  coming, the thief had gone’
                  Zeynaba berasasta ra Hasan besia fefe ‘[before] Z.’s arrival, Hasan had
                  been gone’
           Xia. agar az agardasta ra ema kdriun ne kardeyun bi ‘if by my return (i.e.,
                   when I return) you should not have done these jobs ...’344. Present participles. The following verbal nouns and adjectives may
be grouped here:
  a) a present participle formed by adding the stressed suffix -a and the
prefix be- to the present stem (examples from Cha., Ebr., and Sag.).
Such participles often impart the sense of an active future participle.
Examples:
        Ebr.117        ma adami be-rxin-a ni ‘this man is not [a] buying [type]’
                    ma adami b-emi-alls ni ‘this man is not coming (i.e., is
                    not the kind of man who would come)’
                    ma marcina (f.) arem a-fa nie ‘this cat is not apt to be¬
                    come quiet (i.e., is not the kind of cat to become quiet)
                    be-vaj-a ‘weaving’
                    be-si-a ‘going’
                    vaj-a ‘saying’
            Sag.    era lakka be-si-a ni ‘this bio           is not removable (lit.
                    moving)’116   V. § 288 for the absence of be-.
117   V. below for a Cha. example.
118   Equivalent to Pers. amadani.
      252                                      MORPHOLOGY                          am adam berus-a ni ‘this man is not [a] selling [type]’
                          em adam be-min-a ni ‘this man is not going to stay
                          [alive] (i.e., is not well enough to escape death)’
      Notes:
     1. In a poem by Ameli, tajana (from tajltat ‘to run’) occurs with the meaning of
  ‘running’: poron-u tajana ‘running in front’.
     2. Notice the use of the intransitive past participle in the same sense in the following
  examples (cf. § 343):
             Tak. adam-be-gard-a-kas nia ‘he cannot become a humane person (i.e., is
                    past education)
                    ram-a-via asb nia ‘it is not a tamable horse’  b) In Takestani the stressed suffix -e or -a is added to the present stem
  (with or without the prefix be-) to form a participle which, when followed
  by the substantive verb, imparts the meaning of ‘being able to’, e.g.
                Tak.     agaa meveyma esta qayme yard veyme ‘if I were [there]
                         I could (or would) hide you’
                         b-ar-e neyma ‘I am not able to grind (with the hand mill)’
                         vdj-e neyma ‘I am not able to say’
                         bo-xar-e yeysel ‘can you eat?’
                 bar-gen-e neyma ‘I am not able to get out’
 Cf. Takestani perfect, § 316.
 c) As in Persian, the present stem, prefixed by be- if plain, serves as an
 active participle. Such participles are normally either preceded by their
 direct object (if transitive), or followed by a noun as their agent. Often
 the compound indicates a profession. Examples:
                Cha.    gava-run, Esh. gawa-run ‘ox driver’
                     rds-vaj‘sayer of truth’, ‘one who [always] speaks the truth’
               Cha., Tak. izom-beskenj ‘wood cutter’
               Cha. avaze-xen ‘singer’
                        cuara-ceren (Tak. carva-cara) ‘sheep grazer’
               Tak.     ke bd ceme gapa-zan ‘when may it be that he talks of me’
                        arma-sur, Cha. ambraz-sur ‘launderer’
               Esh.     tar-arus (Zhuk. Mat, II, 160 b) ‘selling wet (instead of
                        dry), a hypocrite’
               Cha.     basnav-a kas119 Tak. basnu-a kas ‘hearer (lit. [a] hearing
                        person)’
               Tak.     beron-a kas ‘driver’
                        bebar-a kas ‘bearer’
                   Cf. ager-es nie ‘he is not a buyer of it’120119     For -a, v. § 204.
120     Cf. colloquial Pers. be-gir-as nist.
                                          VERBS                                      253d) A present participle made of the present stem and the suffix -ow,
was attested in the following Xiaraji examples:
             Xia.    xand xandow uma ‘he came laughing’
                     bermamow uma ‘he came weeping’
                     ta:na ta:now buma ‘he came gasping’
e) Reduplicating verbal adjectives is sometimes used to impart a more
gerundive sense (v. also d, above):
             Cha.     taja taja boma ‘he came running’
             Tak.    nefas bezana bezana boma ‘he came gasping’
             Sag.    berbana berbana boma ‘he came weeping’
                     bevasta bevasta buma ‘he came running’
                     belangasta belangasta buma121 ‘he came limping’
      .
345 The Infinitive. The infinitive is formed from the past stem (§ 258),
the infinitive morpheme -an (Tak., Xia., Ebr., Sag., Esf., Xoz.) or -en
(Cha., Esh.), and frequently the prefix be- when the stem is plain (v. § 257).
In complex and compound verbs be- is not employed (v. § 287). Examples:
      a) plain,
             Cha.    be-sias(s)-en ‘to get torn, ruptured’
                     be-jund-en, Tak. be-jbnast-an ‘to chew’
                     bat-en, Tak. vat-an ‘to say’

             Tak.     bo-gost-an, Cha. gavas-en, Ebr. gowast-an ‘to want to, to
                      be necessary’
                      be-lavast-an ‘to bark’
                     be-past-an ‘to watch’
                     be-kat-an ‘to fall’
             Esh.     be-ren-ten ‘to pour’

                     b-asi-an ‘to throw’
             Sag.    be-zi-an ‘to beat’

           Tak.    duara sian ‘to get lost’
           Cha.    rahasinden {i.e., raha a-), Tak. rasindan ‘to start off, to
                   put on the way’
Notes:
   1. In Chali when the past stem ends in a vowel, the -e- of the infinitive morpheme is
absorbed by the vowel, e.g.
            Cha. don ‘to give’; cf. Tak. -dian, Esh. -dun, Xia., Ebr., Sag. dan
                   u-non ‘to put’
                   sin ‘to go’
                   bin ‘to be’
                   dmin ‘to come’
                   b-eyson ‘to stand, stay’
   2. In a number of Xiaraji examples, a verbal noun occurs which differs from the
infinitive by having the ending -un (with a faint -n) instead of -an, e.g.
             Xia. netunastemun be-mand-un ‘we could not remain’
                   az netunastem be-xward-un ‘I could not eat’
                   ta betunasti b-est-un? ‘could you (sg.) stay?’
                   betunasti be-dut-uril ‘could you (sg.) sow?’
                   (but be-dut-an balad-is? ‘can you sow?’)
                   netunastem be-vast-un ‘I could not dance’

vastemon ‘dance, dancing’, zdymon ‘act of giving birth’ (cf. Pers. zaymdn, etc.).","[244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"

"3) Transitive Preterit and Imperfect
  335. The transitive preterit is formed of the past stem and the modal
prefix be-, be is omitted, however, in compound and complex verbs
(v. §§ 287-88). Examples:

           Xoz.     az nexri-me, Hasan bexri-se ‘I did not buy [it], Hasan
                    bought [it]’  Notes:
   1. In Takestani the stem-final dental of a past stem merges with the 3rd person sin¬
gular enclitic pronoun -s in c, which is then generally followed by the euphonic -e;
v. § 225.
   2. Gender is not distinguished in the transitive preterit (v. § 320) except in Eshtehardi,
where the older generations tend to distinguish the feminine gender in the verb when
the direct object is animate, e.g.
        Esh.       cue-sun bavard a zania-sun bekota (f.) ‘they brought a stick and beat
                   that woman’
                   asb arasi-es ‘he galloped a horse’
                   madiuna arasia-s ‘he galloped a mare’
        contrast: azira Maryama-s xosden-es beja bavard ‘yesterday he brought M. (f.)
                   with him’
              Cf. Hasane siva-s bexard ‘Hasan ate applets] (f.)’
                   cemen vafra-m derund ‘I swept the snow (f.)’
336. The transitive imperfect differs from the preterit only in having the
affix mi- instead of be- (cf. § 315). Examples:
          Cha. ama hammaruza as-emun mi-pet ‘we used to cook as
                    everyday’
           Tak.     aga me-zunast-em costi-em ana ‘if I knew [it] I would have
                    put down the shoe[s]’
                    m-orce (v. § 225) ‘he used to bring’
           Esh.     cemen mi-gustem buazem ‘I wanted to run’ (v. § 362)
 240                                 MORPHOLOGY            Ebr.    nen-em mexwa Hasan bar-a bema ‘I was eating bread
                    [when] Hasan came through the door’
            Sag.    harrevj nemaz-es me-bat ‘everyday he used to say [his]
                    prayers’
            Xoz.    az hocvaqt sang-em ne-m-asind ‘I never used to throw
                    stone[s]’
 4) Transitive Perfect
   337. The transitive perfect consists of the past stem, the stressed per¬
fective morpheme - which is -i in Takestani, -a and -i (masc. and fem.,
 respectively) in Eshtehardi, and -a/-e in the other dialects            the affix be-,
and the copula (v. § 348). The copula generally assumes the sound of a
faint y after a-\e-, but is frequently omitted102 in rapid speech and
generally absorbed by -i when this is the imperfective morpheme. In
Chali and Ebrahim-abadi the perfective morpheme and the copula merge
in e (v. §§28; 60; 81, b, d). Gender is not distinguished in the transitive
perfect except in Eshtehardi (v. § 333). Examples:
           Cha.     hokm-es biarde ‘he has given orders’
                    men xalas biarde ‘I have saved [him]’
           Tak.     ajive-m besqaldi or jive besqaldi-ma ‘I have pressed this’
                    ana jive-sun besqaldi ‘they have pressed this’
                    nazr-em yardi ‘I have made a vow’
           Esh.     cemen nun bexarda (m.) ‘I have eaten bread (m.)’
                    varfe-y darundi (f.) ‘you have swept the snow (f.)’
                    cera bad bedutey ‘why have you sewn poorly?’
           Xia.    bevin karga awa-s axwarda ‘see [whether] the hen has
                   drunk water’ (cf. the preterit: axwa, i.e., axua(rd))
                   az deraxt-em basiay ‘I have felled the tree’
                   az biane gap-em nezia ‘I have not said such words’
                   (Cf. the preterit: gap-em neza)
                   sevaren ceme vatay besa pela baw ‘the horsemen have told
                   me, “Go [and] bring pilaf”’
           Ebr.    ta nahar-i bexwarde? ‘have you eaten lunch?’
                   a hala nahar-em nexwarde, a nahar-es bexwarde ‘I have
                   not yet eaten lunch, he has eaten lunch’
           Sag.    majenda i-ani-s bera darde ‘they say that he has had
                   another brother’

end.

Note:
   The above Sagz-abadi examples, which conform to the general pattern of the perfect
in the other dialects, do not support the paradigms given by A. A., 175-176, for dardan
‘to have’, jowastan/gowastan ‘to want’, and vdtan ‘to say’, which have the endings of
the intransitive perfect. They may indicate, however, further weakening of the passive
construction through the use of intransitive endings for the transitive verb.","[240, 241, 242, 243]"

                  Hasan nun-es bepat ‘H. baked bread’
 c) the vocative, e.g.
          Tak.   xodd-jun boma revjeddri ‘O dear God, the fasting [month
                 has] arrived’
d) the indefinite direct object, e.g.

                 saba qoc bokos ‘tomorrow slaughter a ram’
e) the indirect object, e.g.

                  boma ta:nd Ferangeston ‘he came to Europe alone’
/) the definite direct object, if defined by a genitive or a possessive ad¬
jective (v. § 156), e.g.

                   ceme gandem bar ‘grind my wheat’

  a) the genitive, e.g.
          Tak.     im-i-da Qazvin-e ray-e ‘and this is the Qazvin road (lit.
                   Q.’s road)’

                   fel aday-sa darvazabon-e ‘he has given money to the gate¬
                    keeper’Note:
When the direct object is defined by a genitive or possessive adjective, it is put in the
direct case, except when it denotes a human being, in which case the oblique in -r is
employed (v. § 163,/. for examples; cf. §§ 90, 134, 156).c) the object of a postposition, e.g.
         Tak. kacalist-e bi hangar zan ‘stir with a ladle’
                    Hasan-e ra ma-vatan ‘don’t tell Hasan’

                    cema hal-e xo xabar ne-diri ‘you have no knowledge of
                    my condition’

"Note:
  In details of nominal inflection each dialect is treated separately.
(a) Chali106. The Chali case endings are:
        Singular                                        Plural
     masc. dir.      nil                              dir.   -e (unstressed)

        fern. dir.   -a (unstressed)                  obi.   -6(n)
         obi. -a (unstressed)
-on appears only occasionally in careful speech and also when followed
by a vowel. Examples:
  Cha. masc. sg. dir. bar beskias ‘the door broke’
                 obi. bar-e beskenj ‘break the door’16 The nasal element in these endings is probably attracted from the oblique plural
ending. In the Tati dialects of Tarom and Khalkhal the direct plural ending is -e.
 76                                    MORPHOLOGY            fem. sg. dir.      barra bekata ‘the spade fell5
                        obi.   misa gusd xwar ni ‘ewe’s meat is not good’

                               raz-on-u ‘in the gardens’
107. The feminine morpheme -a disappears before plural endings, e.g.
        Cha. dir.      xwak-e besend ‘the sisters left’
                       barr-e beskiasenda ‘the spades (f.) broke’
             obi.      cema xwak-o mabara ‘don’t you carry our sisters’
108. a) Nouns ending in stressed -a or in -a have their oblique in stressed
-e (v. § 81, b).
            Cha.       cuara ‘sheep’               sg. obi.    cuare
                     xoyya ‘[wooden] shovel’       sg. obi.    xoyye

                    life (lit. took up life)’
                    xoyye ra ‘for the shovel’
Note:
  cera ‘lamp’, however, does not change in the oblique, e.g.
           cema cera maskenj ‘don’t break our lamp’
           cera fatild ‘lamp’s wick’
           cf. dir. pi. cere, below.b) Such nouns have their direct plural also in stressed -e, e.g.
           Cha.     norca ‘apprentice’             dir. pi.    norce
                    dada ‘father’                              dade

                    norce vela-ha-bend ‘the apprentices dispersed’
                    cuare berasasend ‘the sheep arrived’
c) Such nouns drop their final vowel before -o(n), the oblique plural
morpheme, e.g.
           Cha. joza ‘cotton-pad’                 obi. pi. jozo
                    pil(l)a big                               pil(l)o ‘the great’

                     cera ‘lamp’                         obi. pi.    cerd
Examples from the context:
              jozdn-eso becind ‘they picked cotton-pads’
              ndrcd jivar-marom ‘I gather the apprentices’
              cuaro di ‘give to the sheep (pi.)’
109. a) Nouns in -i do not change in the oblique singular, e.g.
              Cha.   ambdri tiji bekata ‘the pear’s pip has fallen [down]’
                     a sari bin ‘look at that star’
b) Such nouns tend to drop the plural ending in the direct case, e.g.
              Cha.   jay aresni paka nind ‘his elbows are not clean’
                     sake bat ke ilci benda xedmat ‘the king said: “Let the
                     envoys come to [my] presence!”’
                     dah xassi dere ‘it has ten [fruit-] stones’17
                     sari aber-dmenda ‘the stars rose’
In careful speech, however, the ending appears, e.g.
              Cha.   sari-e aber-dmenda ‘the stars rose’
                     macci-e, jili-e besend ‘the bitches, the chicks went’Note:
  The plural of nomazi ‘fiancee’, however, coalesces with that of ndmaza ‘fiance’ in
no maze; the plural of teti ‘girl’ is tele, whereas the plural of teta ‘daughter’ is tele
(v. § 137).c) In the oblique plural, nouns in -i follow the general rule, with a
j-glide bridging the hiatus (v. § 75), e.g.
              Cha.   sari-o beskas ‘look at the stars’
                     ilci-o ku ‘from the envoys’
                     jili-o bdkos ‘slaughter the chickens’
                     ambori-o pus-avij ‘peel the pears’18
110. Nouns in -u have their direct plurals in -o, which supersedes the
final -u (v. § 81, e), and their oblique plural according to the general rule,
e.g.
  Cha. pi. dir.      co beskiasend ‘the wood [pieces] broke’
                     zdro bomenda ‘the children came’
                     em hollo xarabenda ‘these peaches are rotten’
                     so besenda ‘the husbands went’
         pi. obi.    hollu-dn-u uger ‘take from (i.e., take some of) the peaches’
                     du-o bezan da besi ‘brush away the smoke (lit. strike the
                     smokes!) so that it goes’17   In Chali the numbered agrees with the numeral; v. § 110a.
18   The oblique plural of dayi ‘mother’s brother’ was given, however, as dayo.
 78                                   MORPHOLOGY                     cu-o beskenj ‘break the wood [pieces]’
                     su-6 abar-yar ‘drive away the husbands’
 110a. Nouns modified by a numeral higher than one, or by an expression
 denoting plurality, are generally expressed in the plural in Chali, e.g.
            Cha.     ba sas suaro ‘with six horsemen’
                     sad-ona cuare-s bemardend ‘his one hundred sheep died’
                     do gave-s ji bebard cul ‘and he took two cows to pasture’
                     cand suare bomend ‘several horsemen came’
Occasionally, however, the singular is used:
            do xakes dard so bera ‘he had two sisters and three brothers’
In the other dialects, normally the singular is used, e.g.
            Esh.     do siva ‘two apples’
                     so bera ‘three brothers’
                    penj gow ‘five oxen’
                     daraye ses haf titid-iyim ‘I have [some] six [or] seven
                     daughters’
The following example, which occurred in Xiaraji, follows the rule in
Chali:
           Xia.      ba:d az cand mahun (pi.) ‘after several months’(b) Takestani111. The endings for the nominal inflection are:
          Singular                                  Plural
   masc. dir.                nil
        obi.                 -e (unstressed)        dir. and obi.     -on
  fem. dir. and obi.         -a (unstressed)
Note:
   The -e of the oblique is generally more relaxed and more open than the cardinal [e],
approaching [e]. The feminine ending -a, like all unstressed final -a's, on the other
hand, tends to be pronounced as [e] (v. §§ 39, 41). The distinction between the two,
however, is quite clear to the speakers of the dialect. A. Rahmani called the first a
kasra and the second a fatha.
   The -o- in -on varies with different speakers, and even with the same speaker, between
[o] and [u], -n is occasionally dropped, leaving a nasal trace. Examples:  Tak. masc. sg. dir.         tifar espi-e ‘the wall is white’
        masc. sg. obi.        kaqez-e bemasten difar-e ‘stick paper on the wall’
          fem. sg. dir.       asifa xarab a-via ‘the apple became rotten’
          fem. sg. obi.      ja asifa boxar esta-ra xor-a ‘eat that apple, it is
                             good for you’
                  pi. dir.    em qoc{c)-on, mison xorenda ‘these rams, ewes
                              are good’
                                         NOUNS                                         79                   pi. obi.   ja qoc(c)-on, bezon beba ‘take away those rams,
                              goats (f.)’
112. a) Takestani nouns ending in -a or -a do not change in the oblique
singular (but v. § 139):
            Tak.     vaya kid ‘the house of the wedding’
                     avval xoda num ‘first [in] God’s name’
b) Such nouns drop their final vowel before the plural morpheme, e.g.
            Tak.     fera ‘boy’, carva ‘sheep’; pi. feron, carvon
                     feron-xo xeyr-em ne-vind ‘I did not see any benefit from
                      the boys’
                     carvon-em berut ‘I sold the sheep’
The plural of tetia ‘girl’ and teta ‘daughter’ is teton; the plural of zeynia,
zen(n)la ‘woman’, and zana ‘wife’ is zanon (v. § 139); the plural of zarin19
‘child’ is zaron.
     113. When a Takestani feminine noun is followed by a suffix pronoun,
the feminine morpheme changes from -a to -a (unstressed), e.g.
            Tak.     teta-s bomia ‘his daughter came’
                     tetid-s bezast ‘she gave birth to a girl’
                     ra-da zeynia-s vind ‘he saw a woman on the way’
                     beza-m bekosteme ‘I slaughtered my goat’
                     beza-y ra alaf adal ‘did you (sg.) give grass to the goats?’
                     beza-yon bomial ‘did your (pi.) goat come?’20
With -mon ‘our’ and -son ‘their’ the speakers differed. Ahmad Taheri
used -a (orbona-mun, orbona-sun ‘our, their upper-story’), but A. Rahmani
did not alter -a (beza-mon, beza-son ‘our goat, their goat’).(c) Eshtehardi
114. The Eshtehardi case endings are:
                              Singular                        Plural
                     masc. dir. nil                     dir. -ehd21
                              obi. -e (unstressed)      obi. -un
                     fern.    dir. -a (unstressed)
                              obi. -d
Note:
 -un is generally [un], but sometimes -u- is more open. (Cf. § 52)19  n must be secondary. Cf. Cha., Ebr., and Sag. zaru.
20  The following example points to the same treatment in Xoznini: cemen beza-s
berxind ‘he bought my goat’ (trace of an original obi. fern, ending in -a? Cf. § 114).
21 -e- in -ehd may be the trace of the original direct plural ending (?). -ha as a plural
ending occurs also in the related dialects of Alvir and Vidar, in the Kharaqan distiict of
Saveh, as well as in some central dialects; v. ‘The dialects of Alvir and Vidar’, lndo-
Iranica (1964), p. 179. -e- has sometimes a more open articulation, approaching a.

                    masc. sg. obi. Hasan-e siva da ‘give (some) apple[s] to

                                        tore the woman’
115. The feminine morpheme drops out before the oblique plural ending,
e.g.
           Esh.     misa ‘ewe’                         obi. pi. misun
                    bara     ‘spade’                   obi. pi. barun
116. a) Eshtehardi nouns in stressed -a (e.g., esba ‘dog’, taka ‘male goat’,
kisa ‘bag’, kara ‘butter’) have their oblique singular in stressed -i
Examples:
           Esh.    azira esbi cemen-es pa begard ‘yesterday [a] dog bit my
                      leg’
                   taki bebar tavila ‘carry the [male] goat to the stable’
                   kisi beja ‘with [a] bath-glove’24
                   maste kari migerend ‘they are skimming the butter off the
                    yogurt’
b) In such words -a narrows to -i- before the oblique plural morpheme
-un, e.g.
           Esh.    na takiun bezan besendi ‘hit those [male] goats [away so
                      that] they go’
                   cama esbiun kar-i ne bi ‘don’t bother our dogs’
c) Before the direct plural morpheme, -a in such words coalesces with -e-
of -eha25, e.g.
           Esh.    kiseha bezdarestend ‘the bags were torn’
                   esbeha besandi sahra ‘the dogs went into the plain’
117. Nouns in -a and -i do not change in the oblique singular, e.g.
22 The indefinite direct object is expressed in the direct case.
23 The agent is expressed in the oblique.
24 Made of wool or cotton and used by rubbers in Turkish baths.
25 In qoc o taki qati mikarun ‘we [then] mix the sheep and goats’, taki was given as the
plural of taka\ but in view of the other examples I take it to be the sg. obi., with a
generic sense. Note that qoc too is singular.

                    zoma da ‘give [it] to the son-in-law’(d) Xiaraji118. The case endings of Xiaraji are:
                       Singular                             Plural
                raasc. dir. nil                     dir. -en (unstressed)

                fern. dir. and obi.       -a (unstressed)
Notes:
   1. The -n of the direct plural ending is often faint. In the story of Mira-kuru, quoted
by an eighty-year-old informant (v. p. 24), the direct plural appears several times in -e,
which must be the older ending, e.g.
           rafiq-e-s unistenda nun bexwarenda ‘his friends sat down to eat’
-n may have developed under the influence of the oblique ending -un.
   2. In the Resdia, no example of Ramandi direct plural is to be found in -e or -en.

                           D. DIALECT MATERIALS
The present study is based on the materials collected in the course of four
intermittent trips to the Tati-speaking areas during the summers of 1955,
21 Locally Gale kefca.
26 Locally Balin ma:la.
26 E.g. boma ‘he came’, mivazdm ‘we run’, cup(p)dn ‘shepherd’, yon ‘yours’, as against
bema, mivazem, cup(p)en yen,. Cf. Sagz-abadi coppon and edppun ‘shepherd’ of the
Upper and Lower Districts, respectively.
27 Of uncertain date, probably about the 18th century.

                                     INTRODUCTION                           25’58, ’61, and ’63, partly by direct notation and partly by first recording
the materials on tape and later transcribing them. The materials thus
collected include tales, stories, poems, descriptive pieces, and also many
linguistic notes. A list of the informants is given separately for easier
reference (v. p. 275).
   Of the dialects studied here, Chali is presented in the most detail. This is
due partly to the favorable circumstances which made reliable Chali
materials available to me, and partly because of the early interest I took
in this relatively conservative dialect. My chief informant, Mohammad
Baqer Ameli, 58, a cleric of commendable accuracy and reliability, was
also a gifted poet (with the pen-name Bordbar), who wrote poems both in
Chali and Persian. His rather long satirical poem ‘A Peasant’s Wedding’,
which will be given in a later volume of texts, is of considerable interest,
linguistically as well as from the standpoint of the study of folklore.
      Of special interest in the Takestani material are the quatrains obtained
from Ahmad Taheri, the only living Tati ‘minstrel’ in the region. He has a
repertory of some 80 quatrains which he chants accompanied by his
tambourine at weddings and other gay occasions. The poems are note¬
 worthy in their reflection of aspects of local life.
   In Eshtehardi there exists in print a number of glosses that Zhukovsky
 included in his Materiali, II, pp. 92-362.29 These glosses consist of some
 185 items in vocalized Arabic script which Zhukovsky found on the margin
 of a copy of a Persian dictionary, Borhdn-e Jdme\ published in Tabriz m
 1844.3o     The accuracy of these glosses is generally confirmed by my own
 materials.
  In Xiaraji, apart from the materials obtained from my informants, I
 have also used the material contained in the Resala (-ye Loghat-e Fors-e
 Qadim-e Ahali-ye Ram and)?1 a treatise written in (1275/1885-86) by an
 anonymous native of Ramand and offered to E‘te3ad al-Saltana, Minister
 of Arts, Sciences and Commerce, who may actually have commissioned it.
 At all events, it now belongs to the library of Sepahsalar School in Tehran.
 It consists of two parts. The first part contains lexical material arranged
 according to subject, and a few illustrative sentences; the second part, a
 supplement to the first, written in a different hand and apparently by a
 different author, consists of verbal and pronominal paradigms and a list
 of verbs. Contrary to its editor’s assumption, p. 22, the author of the
 Resala does not mix dialects and is careful to record variants from differ- 29     V. Bibliography.

26                                   INTRODUCTIONent villages in the area.32 The material in fact belongs to the dialect of
Xiaraj,33 apparently once the main village and the center of Ramand.
     I have, however, referred to the material of the Resala, following the
designation of its author, as Ramandi rather than Xiaraji, because of the
occasional slight differences between Xiaraji, as obtained from my in¬
formants, and the material contained in the Resala.34 Such differences
may be due partly to a difference of district and partly to a difference in
time (see above).
     For Sagz-abadi, apart from the material obtained from my own in¬
formants (from the Upper and Lower Districts), I have used the material
contained in Tat-nesinha-ye Boluk-e Zahra (Tehran, 1958). This mono¬
graph by Jalal Al-e Ahmad on the Tati-speaking villages of the Zahra
rural district, i.e., Sagz-abad and Ebrahim-abad, contains much useful
information regarding customs, folklore, and general conduct of life in the
two villages, as well as some stories, a lexical list, and some grammatical
remarks. The texts, however, are almost entirely from Sagz-abadi.
   For Danesfani, Esfarvarini, and Xoznini I have used the materials
obtained from my own informants. These materials, generally consisting
of linguistic notes and brief connected texts, were not enough to answer all
questions pertaining to these dialects, but it is hoped that their main
features have been made known.
   Dialect materials, mainly lexical, have now been collected also by the
investigators of the Societe internationale de la dialectologie iranienne
for all the main villages of Ramand, under Professor Georges Redard's
and the author’s direction. These, however, I have not consulted.","[26, 27, 28]"
"    .
351 When the present of the substantive verb follows the postposition
da (v. § 189), a connective -r- intervenes (v. § 76). Except in Eshtehardi,
the -a of -da is frequently narrowed to e. Examples from Takestani and
Eshtehardi:
        Tak.        coma kid kifcina sare de-r-e ‘our house is at the head of
                    the alley’
                    Hasan enga da-r-e ‘H. is here’
                     az enga da-r-eyme ‘I am here’
                     (Cf. a enga da ye ‘it exists here’)
            Esh.    az indd da-r-im, to inadd da-r-is, etc. ‘I am here, you are
                    here’, etc.
               (Cf. az indd da niyim ‘I am not here’)
                    zuma-mun cama kid da-r-a ‘our son-in-law is in our house’
In Takestani, Ebrahim-abadi, Sagz-abadi (and probably in most of the
other dialects), by extension, such forms (e.g. dareym(a), dareys(a), dare)
have come to mean ‘I am, you are, he is’, etc., without necessarily im¬
plying a locative sense, e.g.
          Tak. agar layeqe esta zumagari dere ‘if he is worthy of being
                     your (sg.) son-in-law’
            Sag.     omurate cia cemen-u dere ‘the work of the house is up
               to me’
     .
352 It seems that in the following Chali examples be/be (m., f.), from
the base bay- (and not ah-, v. § 356), is used in the sense of ‘is’ (cf. § 359):
            Cha.    a ce be131 ‘what is that?’
                    panj angust yaki me-ne-be ‘the five fingers are not (lit. is
                     not) the same’
                     em pajar eske be ‘whose is this shoe?’130 Some corrupt forms appear in the Resala: sg. 1. bm (64) is for yin. Sg. 2. bY.f
(65, 74), negative nb’sh (65) are obviously erroneous. The correct form is tysh (65)
\*tey$a ‘you are’) and yys (72) (*yis; thus to be read, not byS). Sg. 3. ”y (64) is *a-i
‘he is’; cf. y (*/) (56) ‘is’ and ny (*ni) (56, 66) ‘is not’.
131 Notice that the subjunctive is bi and gender is not distinguished in it.

 b) Subjunctive     .
 353 The subjunctive of the substantive verb is conjugated as follows.
 The 1st and the 2nd persons singular and the 3rd person plural may be
followed by the euphonic -aj-e (v. § 298). V § 305 for some double forms.

Examples (from ‘to be’ and ‘to become’):
            Cha.     dir a-bi ‘[that] it become late’
                     harom a-bi ‘may it become wasted!’
                     migaves ta bas yd ne-bas ‘whether you (sg.) want to be

           Ebr.      Hasan naxos bi dimes ma’lume ‘[if] H. be ill, it will be
                     evident from his face’
                     Hasan bi ta az bem ‘let H. be (stay) until I come’
                     a bem ta ta bayasal ‘shall I be (stay) until you come?’

                     a bi ta a bayem ‘let him be (stay) until I come’132 The Ram. 2nd person singular is *na bdsa (65), wrongly translated nisti ‘I am not’;
cf. *migow bas (65) ‘you want to be’, and na-basa ta (66) ‘that you not be’ (Persian
na-basi). nb'yn (66) is a misreading for nb'y. notice the close similiarity between y and
the ligature yn in the lithographed page 74, column 4.

                      robber[s] will not come’
c) Optative354. Examples occur in Chali (and also rarely in Takestani) of the 3rd
person singular optative of ‘to be’ and ‘to become’:
              Cha.    zon-i lal a-ba ‘may your tongue become dumb!’
                      sar e kar-i ba xodaye jabbar ‘may your business be with
                      God the overwhelming!’
                      baes kur a-ba ‘may the instigator become blind!’
                      cema kar jur a-ba ‘may our affair become sorted out!’
              Tak.    ke ba ceme gapa zan ‘when may it be that he talks of me!’
Generally, in Takestani, and often in Chali, however, the subjunctive is
used for the optative, e.g.
              Cha.    harom a-bi ‘may it be wasted’
              Tak.    harum a-be ‘may it be wasted’
d) Preterit355. The preterit of the substantive verb is conjugated as follows:
         Cha. Tak. Esh. Xia.          Ebr. Sag. Dan. Esf.         Xoz.
Sg. 1.   bim     veym beym fem fim            veym vem      bim   vem

    3.         bend    vind   bandi fend       fend    vend    vend             vendNotes:
  1. Chali. The 3rd person plural occurs also as bin(d). The negative was given as sg.
ni-bim, ni-bis, ne-bu, pi. ni-bimo, ni-bio, ne-bend(a).
   2. Takestani. The forms given above were consistently used by J. Taheri as inde¬
pendent preterit. As auxiliary of the pluperfect, however, both the above and the
following forms were used: vim(a), vis(a), ve, vimon, vion, vind(a). I could not be quite
sure that some of my informants did not sometimes use the perfect instead of the
preterit, or whether the distinction between the two was quite clear to them (v. § 316,
n.; 357). In the transitive pluperfect, when ve is followed by an enclitic agent pronoun,
the -e of ve is narrowed to -i-, e.g.
262                                 MORPHOLOGY          Tak.    aga beruta vi-s ‘if he had sold’

                   basta-vi-Se besa-ve ‘[if] he had let [him], he would have gone’
  3. Ramandi. The Ramandi forms are veyma, veysa, bev, veymun, veya, vinda. For
veyma, etc., as against vima, etc., notice the vocalization in the lithographed specimen
of the manuscript, p. 74. In brdyd and brdnd (66), -r- is a misreading of w, and the
corresponding Chali forms given by the editor are accordingly irrelevant.
  4. Danesfani. v- came close to w in the pronunciation of my informants. The 3rd
person feminine singular occurs also as vua in a pluperfect:
           Dan. aya bevasti vua ‘she had run away’
vu is reduced to *-v in the pluperfect (v. § 321) and combined with the -a of the past
participle in -ow (the speech of A. Ansari), e.g.
           Ebr. a bevastow ‘he had fled’
  5. Xiaraji, Ebrahim-abadi, Sagz-abadi, and Xoznini use -v/-/, the short form of the
3rd person masculine singular, in the pluperfect; v. § 321.","[261, 262, 263, 264]"
"7 Cf. Cha. banjia, ‘shredded dough’, lit. ‘cut, shredded’, which shows the older form
of the past stem. Cf. § 343, n. 1.
    186                                MORPHOLOGY    262. Variation in the formation of the past stems is not rare among the
    dialects. It results mainly from the preservation or non-preservation of
    the older forms, e.g.
              Cha.    -vaz/vast, but Tak. vaz/vazast ‘to jump’
              Cha., Ram (75), Sag. (143) cin/ci, but Tak. cin/cind ‘to pick,
                    to cut’8
             Cha. jun/jund, but Tak.jon/jdaast ‘to chew’
             Esh., Cha. dir/dard, but Tak. dir/dast ‘to have’
             Tak.    andar/andast, Cha.         andar/andas(s),      but    Esh.   undarl
                     undard ‘to find’
             Esh.    zunlzund, but Cha. zdnjzonast, Xia. zun/zunast ‘to know’
             Cha.    kun/kund, Tak. akunlakund ‘to beat, to pound’, but
                     Esh. -ku/kot ‘to beat, to thresh’
                                       C. PREVERBS9                                         1. Chali    263. The Chali preverbs are be-, a-, de-, and u-. The meaning of these
    is generally idiomatic. It may be noted, however, that be-, which is used
    also as a modal prefix, is emphatic or neutral and is not infrequently
    dropped.10 de- often implies the meaning of ‘in’, u- sometimes means
    ‘up, upward’. The meaning of a- is more difficult to specify. Examples:
            Cha. (be-)paten ‘to scatter, sprinkle’
                     a-paten ‘to toss [cereals in trays in order to clean them
                     of sand, chaff, etc.]’
                     de-paten ‘to scatter [seed, powder, etc., with a definite
                     purpose], to sow’
                     u-paten ‘to winnow’
                     (be-)duten ‘to sew’
                     a-duten ‘to sew a dress, to sew seams’
                     de-duten to sew a patch on, to patch [by sewing], to sew
                     together’
                     (be-)cinden ‘to pick’
                     u-cinden ‘to pick up (used for birds picking up grains)’
                     buanden (pres, van-) ‘to pour, to throw out’
8    Chali has both forms; v. above.
9 ‘Preverb’ is used in this work for an initial non-modal verbal affix, and ‘prefix’ for an
initial model ‘affix.’ be- figures as both a preverb and a prefix. V. § 267 for a chart of
Southern Tati preverbs.
10 This is also the case in the other dialects.

                    circumcision ceremony, and to throw dice or knuckle¬
                    bones)’
                    b-asinden ‘to throw (e.g. a stick at something), to spread
                    [the bed], to drop’
                    d-asinden ‘to throw in (e.g. sugar into a cup, wood into
                    the oven, or a pebble into a well), to instigate [a quarrel
                     or fight]; to push in place (e.g. a bolt or a button)’11
V. § 290 for some other examples.
Notes:
   1. A preverb a- occurs in the verb andar/andas ‘to find’ (v. below n. 3, and §§ 264,265).
   2. In the verb ‘to give’, an -n- intervenes between the d- of the verbal base and the
prefix u-. This is also the case in Xia., Ebr., Sag., and Dan. (For Tak. d-dian v. § 264;
for Esh. ar-dun v. § 265) Examples:
             Cha. undon ‘to give’
                   undi ‘give!’
                   agar unde ‘if he gives’
             Xia. unda-s ‘he gave’
             Ebr. undan ‘to give’
             Sag., Dan. undi ‘give!’
-n- is not, however, constant and generally drops out when another affix intervenes, e.g.
             Cha. u-mi-da ‘he gives’
                   u-ma-di ‘don’t give’
                   u-m(i)-ne-da ‘he does not give’
             Ebr. m-u-diem ‘I give’
                   m-u-da-m ‘I used to give’
Further inquiry is needed to determine the degree of constancy of -n- in the various
dialects.
   3. In the verb ‘to find’, Cha. andar/andas, Tak. andar/andast, Esh. undar/undard,
Xia., Ebr., Sag., Dan. undar/undast, -n- is constant, and therefore must be different
from the -n- in the verb ‘to give’ (above). Cf.
ii
     V. § 265, fn. for asind- as a plain stem.
     188                                   MORPHOLOGY                Cha.   andar ‘find!’

                       give [it] to H.’
     In only one instance the verb appeared without -n-:
               Dan. u-mi-dast ‘he found’ (by analogy with u-mi-da ‘he gave’?)
                                           2. Takestani     264. The following Takestani preverbs occur: be-, a-, a-, de-, u- (a- and
     de- are rare). Examples:
                Tak.     be- be-umian ‘to come5
                               be-sqaldan ‘to press’
                               be-rutan ‘to sell5
                        a-     a-yardan ‘to open5

                               u-listan ‘to lick5
Note:
   In o-gordan to lift, pick up’ (ongore ‘he lifts’) and o-satan ‘to weigh’ (onsanje ‘he
weighs’) the preverb, which is u- in the other dialects (but v. § 266, n.), regularly appears
as o- in my notations. To determine whether o is here a mere allophone of u, and if so,
what are the circumstances of its occurrence, or whether the phonemic boundaries of
u are passed, needs further investigation. I shall transcribe o in such cases.","[187, 188, 189, 190]"

present (also in the 1st and 2nd persons singular present of the substantive
verb, v. § 350), and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd persons singular of the preterit,
imperfect, perfect and, pluperfect. Examples:

Accordingly, in the subjunctive pluperfect only the participle shows the
gender, e.g.

                    a mivast / aya mivasta ‘he used to run / she used to run’
c) In the subjunctive, gender is distinguished only sporadically, if cre¬
dence is given to the sole example in which the feminine differs from the
masculine, e.g.
           Sag.     agar aya bevazia ‘if she runs’ (masc.: bevaze)
          but cf. agar em feraltetia begini arenjeskia-s meskenia ‘if this
                    boy/girl should run his/her elbow will break’

                    agar a/aya bayi, undi, bediyi, bebari ‘if he/she comes,
               gives, sews, carries’
d) Sagz-abadi makes no distinction of gender in the perfect, pluperfect,
or in past transitive verbs, e.g.
          Sag. a I aya besiey ‘he/she has gone’
                  majenda Hasan/Zeynaba india vey ‘they say H./Z. has

                    da cemen bumian Hasan/Zeynaba besia-v ‘H./Z. had gone
                    before my coming’
                    Hasan/Zeynaba azira besia-v doh ‘yesterday H./Z. had
                    gone to the village’
                    dada-s/maya-s marda-v ‘his father/mother had died’
                    Hasan/Zeynaba ermaz-es tan meca ‘H./Z. would put

singular of the present (but not in the substantive verb), preterit, perfect,
and pluperfect, e.g.
39 A. A.’s listing of buxars (sic) ‘she ate’ and vasa ‘she said , 172, as fern, is based on a

     Danesfani does not distinguish the gender in the subjunctive, in past
     transitive verbs, or in the present of the substantive verb, e.g.
              Dan.     buaj Hasan/Zeynaba bay, besi ‘tell H./Z. to come, to go’
                       Hasan/Zeynaba awa-s/set-es uxa ‘H./Z. drank water (f.),
                       milk (m.)’
                                    9. Esfarvarini 283. In Esfarvarini the distinction of the gender was attested in the 3rd
 person singular of the present of the substantive verb, the preterit, and the
 pluperfect. Examples:
              Esf.    Hasan qettar-e ‘H. is short’
                      magava qettar-a ‘the cow is short’
                      (but a/aya ma ‘he/she comes’)
                      a bekat / aya bekata ‘he/she fell’
                      boma / bomi ‘he/she came’
                      a besia bu / aya besid ba ‘he/she went’
 Esfarvarini makes no distinction of gender in the subjunctive, e.g.
                      mogo besi ‘he/she wants to go’
                                     10. Xoznini284. In Xoznini the distinction of gender was attested in the 3rd person
singular of the present (but not in the substantive verb), the preterit,
perfect, and pluperfect. Examples:
             Xoz.     a mid ‘he comes’
                      aya miaya ‘she comes’
             (but     a beland-e ‘he is tall’40  My only example of the fem. perfect is from the substantive verb.
    From bevasta-v; cf. Ebr. bekata-f ‘he had fallen’, Xoz. buma-f ‘he had come   V

 Xoznini does not distinguish the gender in the subjunctive, e.g.
              Xoz.    bevaj Hasan/Zeynaba bay ‘tell H./Z. to come’                                    E. MODAL AFFIXES
 286. The modal affixes employed in verbal conjugations are the prefixes
 be, me-1 mi-, the negative ne-/na-, and the prohibitive ma-.
                                          1. be- be- occurs normally in the imperative, subjunctive, optative, preterit,
perfect, pluperfect(s), infinitive, and the past participle, if the verbal stem
is plain, i.e., includes no preverb.43 Examples from Chali:44
           Cha. sg. 2. imptve.       be-ttaj ‘run!’
                     sg. 1. subj.         be-ttajem ‘[that] I run’
                     sg. 3. opt.          be-kosa ‘may he kill!’
                            pret.         be-ttajas(s)im ‘I ran’
                            perf.         be-ttajas(s)em ‘I have run’
                            pluperf.     be-ttajas{s)a bim ‘I had run’
                            inf.         be-ttajas{s)en ‘to run’
                            past part.   be-ttajas(s)a ‘run’
Old preverbs, merged with the stem and no longer separable, do not bar
the use of be-, e.g.
             Tak.    b-ordan ‘to bring’ < a + bar
                     b-umian ‘to come’ < d + gam
In the following verbs with a plain stem, be- is dropped, or preferably not
used: Cha. dirldard, Tak. der/dast ‘to have’; Cha., etc., gard/gardast, Esh.
gard/gahast to turn, to become ; Cha. gd/gavas, Ebr. gowjgowast. Sag.
jow/jowast, ‘to want to’ (Tak., however, uses be- with go/gost ‘to want
43    be- is also counted among the preverbs, v. § 263.
44    For brevity’s sake, examples are given from selected dialects.

ples from Takestani:
            Tak.    sg. 2. imptve.      a-yar ‘open!5 (trans.)
                    sg. 1. subj.        a-yarem ‘[that] I open5

                           inf.         a-yariastan ‘to open5 (intrans.)
                           past part, a-yariasta ‘opened5
b) be- is also dropped normally in compound verbs (v. § 257, n. 1.), e.g.
            Cha. jor so ‘he went up5 (but be-sd jor ‘he went up5)

                    ta mogo-y gaza geri ‘you want to bite5
                    gura-s zand ‘he called out5
                    duara so ‘it became lost’
c) The use of the negative ne-/na- precludes that of be-, e.g.
            Cha.    n-oma ‘[that] I do not come5
                    ne-rman ‘don’t weep5
                    n-asind-es ‘he did not throw5
            Tak.    n-aya ‘[that] you do not come5
288. When the verbal stem begins with v-, in Tak. be- often coalesces with
v-45; in Cha. v- disappears, or leaves a trace in the form of a faint -u-; in
Esh. be- combines with v- into bu- e.g.
            Tak.    vinem ‘[that] I see5
                    vindem ‘I saw5
                    vace ‘he said5 (v. § 225)
       (contrast:   be-variast ‘it rained5)
            Cha.    biaz < vaz- ‘run, flee!5
                    biastan ‘to run, to flee5
                    binda bu < vin- ‘he had seen5
                    baton < vdj- ‘to say5

"71. Length for y and w applies only to the combinations ey and ow in
rapid speech (cf. §§ 28, 32, 60), e.g.
           Tak.    meytar [mej'Pser, me:t‘aer] ‘groom’
           Dan. furey [fu'rej, fu'reJ, fu're:] ‘boy (obi.)’
           Xia.    yon’ [jow, jow, jo:] ‘barley’
                                         GENERAL                                    53
                                B. REDUCED VOWELS
    72. In unstressed syllables e occasionally is reduced or omitted, e.g.
             Cha. (e)sta xwaka ‘your sister’
                     panir g{e)raten ‘to make cheese’
                     pul a-m(e)-negiril ‘don’t you take money?’
              Xia.   b(e)sia ‘she went’
              Ebr.   d(e)parit ‘he sifted’
    73. In Xiaraji, Ebrahim-abadi, and to a lesser extent Sagz-abadi the
    omission of the e of the verbal prefix be- creates initial clusters in which b
    is devoiced, being assimilated to the following voiceless consonant, e.g.
              Ebr.   besia [p'l'dae] ‘she went’
                     becian [p‘tjiljaen] ‘to pick’
                     bekat [p'k'aet*] ‘he fell’
             Xia.    bexwardaf[p‘xwae-] ‘he had eaten’
    In Ebr. deparit [tcpcae'rit'] ‘he sifted’ the same treatment was observed.1
    By extension, reduction or omission of the e of be- and de- occurs also in
    cases where the particle is stressed, e.g. in the imperative of the above
    verbs, e.g.
             Ebr.    [!pcsae] ‘go!’
                     [lt<p<serid3] ‘sift!’2                                       C. HIATUS
74. Hiatus is generally avoided. When two vowels come into contact,
if they do not merge (v. § 81) and if the second vowel does not change into
a semi-vowel (v. § 81, n. 1), they are generally bridged by a faint glide
[w, j], or by an intrusive r, or rarely by h.
      75. The glides [w, j] normally follow i and u, respectively, when
followed by a vowel. As such they are not indicated in transcription, e.g.
             Cha.    piom [ 'p'dom] ‘my father’
             Tak.    bia ['bdae] ‘she made’
             Esh.    nil [ lniJi] ‘she is not’
             Ebr.    besii [ 'bejdi] ‘she has gone’
             Cha.    suar [siilwar] ‘horseman’
1  Probably a Turkish influence.
2  An interesting case of mistaken identity through this treatment is Ebr. pstewij-l
pstewit- ‘to peel!’, wherep is primary < pus/, but is dropped where be- would be drop¬
ped: cf. pstewij ‘peel’, mastewij ‘don’t peel’; v. § 288, n. for further detail.
54                                   PHONOLOGY           Tak.     man [rulwasn] ‘ghee’
           Esh.    amuun [smulwun] ‘uncles’
y, however, may bridge the hiatus after e, a, and a (v. § 305), e.g.
           Tak.    so ma-y-e digar ‘in another three months’
                   soma-y-un ‘you (a double plural)’
           Esh.    mirinje-y-d mid ‘he is scattering (seed) and coming’
           Xia.    baga-y-e! ‘is there?’
                   cema-y-u ‘with us’ (but Esh. jaun [d3alwun]
Examples of a connective h:
           Cha.     vela-h-abend ‘they became dispersed’
           Ebr.     ma-h-en ‘these’ (cf. ma ‘this’)
                   bdla-h-ada ‘from the above’
           Xoz.    low darya-h-a ‘at the seashore’
76. r as a connective element occurs in all the dialects, mostly after a and
a. Further study is needed to determine the circumstances of its occurence,
which is probably fixed by usage. Examples:
           Cha.    ruazd-r-ijdm ‘my grandson, too’
           Tak.    kifcina-de-r-e ‘it is in the alley’
           Esh.    u-r-dsin ‘throw up!’
           Xia.    de-r-e ‘is (in)’ (v. § 351)
           Ebr.    jindi-r-a ‘from this’
                   jua-r-a de-r-e ‘it is in that one’
                   jua-r-en ‘from those’
           Sag.    esta-r-ij-d3 ‘from you, too’                           D. VOWEL ASSIMILATION
76a. Cases of vowels being assimilated to other vowels in their vicinity
are not infrequent in rapid speech. Such assimilation consists mainly of
rounding of spread vowels or palatalizing of open ones. The vowel most
receptive to assimilative change is the unstressed e. The most frequent
cases of vowel assimilation occur in the verbal affixes be- and me-jmi- (v.
§ 296)4 where e or i may occasionally pass into a different phoneme, e.g.
           Cha.    umia pur-es ['pffiruj] ‘his uncle’s son’
                   mi-zdn-dm [mizon'om] ‘I know’
           Tak.    gus-em ['gujum] ‘my ear’
s In some cases r has settled as a constant part of a word or expression, e.g. urasinden
‘to throw up’, in Esh. and dare/dere ‘is’ in most of the dialects (v. § 351).
4 Only when the assimilated vowel is constant has it been treated as a different
phoneme. This may need adjustments, however, when more material is available.
                                   GENERAL                              55
                  me-ne-go-m [mo'nogom] ‘I don’t want’

                                  E. CLUSTERS
77. Gemination of consonants occurs medially and not infrequently, e.g.
         Cha.     bettaj ‘run!’
                  xassa ‘bone’
                  xbyya ‘wooden shovel’
         Tak.     xozza ‘sand’
                  cilli ‘chick’
                 pella ‘big’
         Xia.     havvaz ‘jump!’
No geminated consonant was observed initially or before a pause.
  78. Clusters do not occur initially except through loss of vowels (v.
§ 72). Such clusters are rare in Chali, Takestani, and Eshtehardi, but
relatively frequent in Xiaraji, Ebrahim-abadi, and Sagz-abadi rapid
speech, normally but not exclusively when one of the consonants is a
continuant.     The following initial clusters occur in Ebrahim-abadi:
[p'J, PctJ, P% pckc, t‘pc]. (V. § 73 for examples.)
  For [pcst‘-], attested in one Ebr. verb, v. § 73, fn.
  Primary clusters in the same syllable occur only in final syllables. Such
attested clusters all include one continuant, e.g.
         Cha.     konj ‘corner’
                  hafs ‘prison’
                  varg ‘wolf’
                  bomend ‘they came’
                  nard ‘did not bring’
                  deraxt ‘tree’
 56                                 PHONOLOGY          Tak.   xemn ‘blood’
                 besgald ‘he pressed’
          Esh.   uza-magz ‘walnut kernel’
          Xia.   pevl ‘money’
                 haft ‘seven’
                 maqz [maeyz] ‘brain’
                 hast ‘eight’
                 kevz ‘brook’
          Ebr.   kamb ‘little’
                 vaqt [vaej't'] ‘time’
79. There is a tendency in all the dialects to drop a final r or the second
consonant of a final cluster beginning with a nasal or r. Occasionally, both
members of such clusters are dropped, e.g.
          Cha.   beba(r) ‘carry!’
                 ya(r) ‘do!’
                 dia{r) ‘pour!’
                 besken(j) ‘break!’
                 var(g) ‘wolf’
         Xia.    da{:) < dar < dard ‘had’ (v. § 70)
         Dan.    bua(j) ‘say!’
Dropping of the final consonant is commonest before a pause, but occurs
elsewhere, e.g.
         Xia.    ugera-sa < ugerat- ‘he lifted’
                 meva-sa < mevat- ‘he used to say’
80. Within a word’s boundary, the cluster -st does not occur in Chali but
is common in the other dialects. In Chali cases t is assimilated to 5,
producing s(s), e.g.
         Cha.    vessar ‘mattress’
                 betonas(s)en ‘to be able to’, Tak. betonestan
                 debas(s)en ‘to fasten’, Tak. debastan
Optional variation between st and .?(.?) was observed to occur occasionally
in all the dialects.","[54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"
"                                       1. Chali161. The direct case is used in Chali for:
     a) the subject, e.g.
            Cha. Qamar Vazir pa-bu beso ‘Q. V. got up [and] left’
                     varziar-e bemandenda da sarbaz-e berasasend ‘the farmers
                     remained until the soldiers arrived’
b) the vocative, e.g.
         Cha. Hasan ... mew berxin ‘H., buy [some] almond[s]’
                     ay pia-jon ‘O, dear father!’

                      aya maje loccona ‘that one says, “O, unchaste one’”
 Notes:
    1. In the following verse by Ameli, bateso hala vaya roxsat migo pio berard-m ‘they
 said: ‘O my elders (lit. fathers) [and] brothers, the bride asks leave’, beraro has, con¬
 trary to the rule, an oblique ending. Ameli commented that it was not regular but
 idiomatic. The regular form he considered would be pio bero-m. Cf. mayom, nanom
 ‘O, my mother’ (maya, nana ‘mother’).
    2. In ey huri-e behest-a ‘O, maiden of Paradise’, which occurs in a poem by Reza’i,
 -a is probably the feminine morpheme added to the ezafa compound, rather than a
 vocative ending comparable to the Persian -a. c) the indefinite direct object, e.g.
              Cha.   alaf undi cuare ‘give grass to the sheep’
                     janjal de-mi-bandom ‘we fasten [a] threshing machine’
                     pul piar-i ku uger ‘get money from your father’
                     qoc bexrinas xuar-tar-e da misa ‘if you buy ram[s] it is
                     better than [buying] ewe[s]’
 d) the singular definite direct object if inanimate and defined by a
 genitive or pronominal adjective, e.g.
              Cha.    Hasan-e das beger ‘take Hasan’s hand’
                     cema janjal bar ‘bring our threshing machine’
                     cema sate bar sa-bedi ‘mend the door of our yard’
                     Hasane zemin berxin ‘buy H.’s plot’
                     cema zamin berxin ‘buy our plot’
              (cf.   zamine berxin ‘buy the plot’
                     cema zamino berxin ‘buy our plots’)
When such a definite direct object denotes an animal, it is expressed in the
oblique (v. § 156, b); when a human being, in the oblique in -r (v. § 156, a).
All plural objects are expressed in the oblique (v. § 154).
  e) the indirect object, e.g.
              Cha.   bi-esta me-nesom behest ‘without you I will not go
                     [even] to paradise’
                     dasi-es Sdh Ebrdhim-e gardan54 ‘throw it [around] Shah
                     E.’s neck.’
                     cudron-i dasin corma ‘put (lit. throw) your sheep into the
                     fold’
      .
162 The oblique case is used in Chali for:
     a) the genitive, e.g.
63    V. § 81, a.
      In this and the following example the object may be considered a direct one; v. §

                   asb-e da:na be-dir ‘hold the horse’s bridle’Notes:
   1. The plural oblique ending is used in patronymics:
            Cha. Qasem-o Yusef‘Y. of the house of Q.’
                  Sa-ma:d-d Ali Akbar ‘A. A. of the house (or clan) of Shah Moham¬
                  mad’
                  Seyx-A-Bozorg-o Ma:d Baqer ‘M. B. of the house of Shaikh Aqa-
                  Bozorg’
2. In genitive compounds, the genitive ends in -a (v. § 160), e.g.
            Cha. uz-a mond ‘walnut kernel’
                  luas-a jili ‘fox’s young’
                  um(m)i-a pur ‘uncle’s son (/.<?., cousin on the father’s side)’
                  dusab-a xomba ‘[grape] syrup jar’
                  ron-a bassua ‘ghee jar’
In all such compounds the stress is apparent only in the second member. When the
combination is not a compound, both members show their stress, and the genitive is
expressed in the oblique.
        Cf. Cha. difdr-e gaj ‘wall’s plaster’
                  miz-e payd ‘table’s leg’
                  uz-e pussa beskenj ‘crack the walnut’s shell!’
3. In cuaron-e set ‘milk of the sheep’, the -e of the oblique singular seems extended to
the plural.b) the agent in a passive construction, e.g.
         Cha. mard-e pul xarj yard ‘the man spent [some] money’
                Amir Arsalan-e kamar-es debast ‘Amir Arsalan fastened
                    his belt (i.e., girdled himself)’
                    cemen piar bat ‘my father said’
                   je deh-e varziar-ar emsala bar nard ‘this year the tar-
                    mer[s] of this village did not get (lit. bring) crop[s]’55
c) the definite direct object, except when singular, inanimate, and defined
by a genitive or pronominal adjective (v. §§ 90, 156), e.g.
            Cha.   em qoc-e berxin ‘buy this ram’
                    cemen ostor-e deband ‘tie my camel
                   jd pur-e cesrn-o debandom ‘[that] I close the boy’s eyes’
d) the logical direct object in a passive construction, e.g.
         Cha. arusia mardemo mano-so jivar-ard ‘they gathered the
                    people (pi.) of the wedding [and their] likes’ (v. § 158).
e) the object of a postposition, e.g.","[105, 106, 107]"

and 3rd persons singular), in the preterit and the imperfect (1st, 2nd. and
3rd persons singular), perfect (1st, 2nd, and 3rd persons singular), and

                    em beza xware32 ‘this [female] goat is good’30 One might treat the feminine forms of the copula as the result of -el-a ‘is’ and the
feminine morpheme of the word which precedes it; v. below.
31 For -(a), v. § 298 the euphonic -a/-e. For <?, v. § 81, d.
33 This may be analyzed as *xudra (fern. v. § 205) + e, but notice that ‘is’ has different
independent forms for the masculine and feminine.
