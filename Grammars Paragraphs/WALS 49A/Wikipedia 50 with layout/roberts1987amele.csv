"PREFACE
Until quite recently, work on theoretical linguistics and work on language descrip-
tion proceeded almost entirely in isolation from one another. Work on theoretical
linguistics, especially in syntax, concentrated primarily on English, and its results
were felt to be inapplicable to those interested in describing other languages.
Work on describing individual languages was almost deliberately isolationist,
with the development of a different framework and terminology for each language
or language group, and no feeding of the achievements of language description
into linguistic theory. Within the last few years, however, a major rapproche-
ment has taken place between theoretical and descriptive linguistics. In particular,      JOHN   R. ROBERTS
the rise of language typology and the study of language universals have pro-
duced a large number of theoreticians who require accurate, well-formulated
descriptive data from a wide range of languages, and have shown descriptive
linguists that they can both derive benefit from and contribute to the develop-
ment of linguistic theory. Even within generative syntax, long the bastion of
linguistic anglocentrism, there is an increased interest in the relation between
syntactic theory and a wide range of language types.
   For a really fruitful interaction between theoretical and descriptive linguistics,
it is essential that descriptions of different languages should be comparable. The
Questionnaire of the present series (originally published as Lingua, vol. 42 (1977),
No. 1) provides a framework for the description of a language that is (a) suffi-
ciently comprehensive to cover the major structures of any language that are
likely to be of theoretical interest; (b) sufficiently explicit to make cross-language
comparisons a feasible undertaking (in particular, through the detailed number-
ing key); and (c) sufficiently flexible to encompass the range of variety that is
found in human language. The volumes that were published in the predecessor
to the present series, the Linga Descriptive Studies (now available from Croom
Helm), succeeded in bridging the gap between theory and description: authors
include both theoreticians who are also interested in description (e.g. Peter Cole
on Imbabura Quechua) and field-workers with an interest in theory (e.g. John
Davis on Kobon).
   The aim of the Croom Helm Descriptive Grammars is thus to provide descrip-
tions of a wide range of languages according to the format set out in the Ques-
tionnaire. Each language will be covered in a single volume. The first priority
of the series is grammars of languages for which detailed descriptions are not
at present available (thus, the monographs on Nkore-Kiga and Babungo are the
first comprehensive descriptions of those languages). However, the series will
also encompass descriptions of better-known languages with the series framework
providing more detailed descriptions of such languages than are currently available
(as with the monographs of West Greenlandic and Kannada).",[1]
