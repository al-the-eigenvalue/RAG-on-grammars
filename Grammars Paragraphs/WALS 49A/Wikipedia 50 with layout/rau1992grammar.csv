6.2.1. The nominative case
       The nominative case is used for the subject, the predicate, and thetopic of a sentence.    The nominative case forms of the personal pronounsare given in § 5.3.     The common nouns and proper nouns may be precededby the definite article or nominative marker qu’.
       The subject of a sentence must be a nominative form: that is, the subject of a sentence must be either a nominative pronoun (§ 5.3), a phraseintroduced by qu’, or a noun phrase.      In the following sentences, the PREDICATE is capitalized and the subject is bolded.",[158]
"        In Chapter Six, Atayal sentences are said to contain a predicate andoptionally a subject.    The nouns/pronouns distribute in sentences to fill theroles of agent and nominal predicate by means of the nominative, genitive,and the dative cases.     The patient, recipient, benefactive, location, time,manner or instrument are expressed by the verb.",[215]

(#) MNAKI' MAN|AN UZI qu' minagaN qa. (Rau, H58)ACT-PA-live PN also NOM ACT-PA-take that
‘The family I married into alse lived in Mangan.’      (Lit. ‘Those people whotook me also lived in Mangan.')
6.2. Cases
       Atayal nouns/pronouns distribute in sentences to fill the roles ofagent and nominal predicate by means of the following cases: nominative,genitive, and dative.    The patient, recipient, benefactive, location, time,manner or instrument are expressed by the verb.","[157, 158]"
        When proper names or pronouns are the predicate they are in thenominative case.    In the case of pronominal predicates the nominativefree form (§ 5.3) is used.,[160]
"        In direct passive sentences, the agent (the one who causes the action) is in the genitive case.   The direct object, which is the thing orperson caused to be or do is in the nominative case.       The following sentences exemplify passive causative verbs as the predicate and the direct

       Causative verbs (§ 4.5) like other verbs can be the subject orpredicate of the sentence or can modify other phrases.       In activesentences, the agent, the one who causes s.0. to do s.t. or s.t. to be done, is
in the nominative case. The case of the direct object (patient) of active
causative verbs is unknown due to lack of data.       The following sentenceexemplifies the active causative verb as the predicate of the sentence and
the agent as the subject of the sentence.    The agent (underlined bolded) isin the nominative case but the PATIENT (underlined capitalized) is
probably in the dative case with the dative marker sa dropped.","[173, 174]"

6.2.2. The genitive case          The genitive forms are used to refer to possession (among otherthings).    The genitive forms of the pronouns are listed in § 5.3.   Genitiveforms of common nouns optionally have the particle na’ (or n) in front ofthem.      Proper names and kinship terms sometimes have the alternate
particle ni’ for the genitive.",[161]

6.2.5. Case marking       The Atayal sentence consists of constituents which are nominative,genitive, and dative.   Otherwise no further case information is supplied bythe constituents of a sentence.     The verb itself, however, indicates a varietyof case relations. The verb is oriented te the form which it is an immediate
constituent of (that is, the verb contains an affix which indicates a caserelationship): it is oriented to the subject if it is the predicate or head of thepredicate, it is oriented to the predicate if it is the subject or head of the
subject.   It is oriented to the word it modifies, if it modifies another phrase,or if none of these it is oriented to the form which is understood from the
context.","[166, 167]"

5.3. Pronouns         The Atayal personal pronouns can be divided into dependent (orclitic, bound) and independent (or free) pronouns.      The bound nominativeand the genitive constitute the dependent (or clitic) set whereas the dativeand the free nominative constitute the independent set . The independentset functions as regular nouns.      The third person singular and pluralnominative pronouns hiya’ and hga’ most frequently occur as theindependent forms.       The first person plural pronouns distinguish inclusive (‘we including you’) and exclusive (‘we but not you’).     The form misu’    ‘I... you' replaces the combination mu (genitive) and su’ (nominative).6.    The pronominal system is presented in Table 5.1.

"        In Chapter Five, it is noted that noun phrases can be eitherpreceded or followed by nominal or adjectival modifiers.       The first personplural pronouns distinguish inclusive and exclusive.",[215]
"7.3.3. Predicates with negative modifications
       The negation preverbs, i.e., ini’ ‘did not, does not’, iyat/yat ‘will not,haven't, cannot, it's not the case...', bali ‘unless’, and laxi “don't’, modifyand precede the predicate.      Only dependent forms are used after int’(§ 3.2.8) Laxi     is followed by the dependent form just as for ini’ , oralternatively laxi may be followed by the present terse to make the
command less blunt.       The verb forms after iyat /yat and bali can be present,past, or future depending on the context.",[188]

 Atayal friend.     In that case the Atayal would talk to the Chinese and would take the salt, gifts, and matches that had been brought to the Atayal

"          However, following Egerod, I do not transcribe the glottal stop inprevocalic position as it does not contrast with its absence.        Further wheninitial vowels are lost in the morphophonemic process of weakening (§ 2.7)
the initial glottal stop is also lost in most cases.    The glottal stop may havebeen developed as a phonetic feature mostly in the word-initial and final position in the modern dialects. The glottal stop in word final position that
 occurs frequently in Egerod's data may be a prosodic process and needs to be checked word by word for future research.          That is, not all of the words which Egerod writes with a word final glottal stop do in fact have a glottal stop.    The glottal stop is written as an apostrophe here, e.g., ki’an “pregnant”.",[40]

"1.5. Theoretical framework
        In this study, the structure of Atayal will be described based on a functional approach to the study of languages (Foiiey & Van Valin 1984, Halliday 1985, Givén 1984),    The structural properties of the sentences in the language are discussed in terms of the pragmatic situations in which they are used.    In other words, the grammar of the language is understood in its entire communicative context, in terms of its functional
 factors.   Functional analysis directs its attention to the context-dependent nature of linguistic units and focuses on the interaction of lingustic forms                        UZ-TRANSLATIONS.NET||

and communicative functions.      This approach leans towards the applied,
rhetorical, actual, functional text rather than the pure, logical, ideal, andformal sentence.    In a functional grammar, the interpretation oflinguistic forms is based on meaning in context.      A language isinterpreted as a system of meanings and grammar is represented asnetworks of choices.   Each element in a language is explained in terms ofits function in the total linguistic system.   In this approach, the predicateis taken to be the basic element of predication.    The grammaticalstructure is explained by reference to the meaning in discourse.      Thus the
constituents of a grammatical structure are labeled by both class andfunction.   The class labels are part of the dictionary whereas the functionlabels are an interpretation of the text.   The functional description of thelanguage identifies on the one hand all the various functions that areincorporated in the grammar and on the other hand all the possiblestructures which serve to express some meaning in the language fromthe most general to the most specific.","[29, 30]"

"2.4. Stress and length        The general word stress falls on either the penult or the last syllableof the word, except when the final syllable has 0. There are two kinds ofstems: those with long vowels in the penultimate syllable and those withshort vowels.   It seems obvious from the data that stress characterizes this
language: the affixed form has the same stress pattern as the root, that is,the accent remains on the penult in affixed form of roots with penultimatestress, and accent remains on the final syllable in affixed form of rootswith final stress.    The exception is root with 0 in the final syllable in which case the stress is always on the penultimate syllable of the root. For example, paqut “to ask"", pquitun “ask about s.t.” vs. tehuk ""to arrive"", thk4n ""reach s.p.” (See § 2.4.1 below).    Roots which have a penultimate stress are analyzed here to contain a long vowel, whereas roots which have a final stress are analyzed to contain a short vowel.",[45]

          /ra/, /n/, and /y/ are bilabial, alveolar, and velar nasais respectively.          /b/ and /g/ are commonly pronounced as bilabial voiced fricatives[8, y].
          /s/ is palatalized before the high front vowel /i/ and is pronounced[fl], otherwise is the alveolar fricative [s]. /s/ occasionally alternates freelywith /h/, e.g., /slaqiy ~ hlagiy/ ""snow"", /snonux ~ hnonux/ “hair (onhead)"", but /s/ and /h/ are indeed contrastive.
          /z/ is a voiced palato-alveolar fricative [z] and almost exclusivelyoccurs before /i/. In some words /z/ alternates freely with /zero/: /zyaw ~yaw/ ""thing"", /bziran ~ biran/ “buy s.t.""; in a few cases it alternates freely
with /g/: /zihen ~ gihen/ ""place name”.          /c/ is a voiceless affricate with J-release before /i/, otherwise with s-
release.      /c/ is aspirated postvocalically and unaspirated otherwise.      /t/ and/c/ alternate after /i/ and do not contrast, e.g., /mit ~ mic/ ""sheep, goat”.",[38]

       An intermediate position is taken by Tsuchida (1976).      He proposesthat Formosan languages as a whole form a single subgroup closelyrelated to the western Austronesian languages (Figure 1.6).       The verbstructure in the Formosan languages is said to exhibit a strikingsimilarity to that of Hesperonesian (Egerod 1965a, 1966a, Wolff1973).        Asthe subsequent chapters may show, Atayal is grammatically very similar
to the languages of the Philippines, especially Tagalog.",[26]

            An Atayal verb usually contains a root or base and one or more affixes.     The base provides the meaning of the verb whereas the primary affixes show the perspective of the sentence, and designates the role relationship of the participant to the event in question.    An Atayal verb is

 morpheme an has cognates in other Austronesian languages (Wolff 1973).",[55]
