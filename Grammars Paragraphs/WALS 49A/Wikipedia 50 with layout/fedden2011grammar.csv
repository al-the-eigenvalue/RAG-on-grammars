5.8.     Verbs with obligatory classificatory prefixBelow are listed the most frequent verbs which require a classificatory prefix.
In a few cases, the classificatory prefix is frozen in the singular form of the
residue class ob-, e.g. ase ob-tanà/ase ob-tunu ‘light with fire’ and aaie ob-dî
‘fetch water’. In the case of the perfective-only stem -kilêb ‘put handle of bag
around forehead so that the bag hangs down the bag (in order to carry the
bag)’ the prefix is frozen as go- from the bundle class.(25)   -â’/—                 ‘leave, let’
       -atdi/—               ‘throw into fire’
       -atou/—               ‘put into fire’
       -ba/-bu               ‘put into a bag, cover’
       -bià/—                ‘push, throw’
       -blangkè/—            ‘push out of the way’

       -fâa/—                ‘lift’
       -halila/-halin        ‘feel sorry for, be concerned about’
       —/-hâa’               ‘chase’
       -kimà/-kimsan         ‘put into fire’

       -ò/—                  ‘take’
       -Ø(-)/—               ‘handle, transfer’
       -ski                  ‘turn’

       -usâ’/-uka          ‘put on (clothes)’
       -waa                ‘hide’Verbs with an obligatory classificatory prefix where the prefix has to index an
animate object are listed in (26).(26)   -klafâ/—     ‘put on back (piggy-back style)’
       -môu/—       ‘put on shoulder’ (pig or child)
       -silêb /—    ‘follow’
       -tamà/—      ‘pen in, imprison’
5.9.     Gender system vs. classification by prefixNominal categorization in Mian is complex due to the fact that two different
nominal classification systems, which show different formal and semantic
properties, exist next to and interact with each other.
   First, there is the category ‘gender’ with the masculine, feminine, neuter 1
and 2 subcategories. All pronominal affixes on the verb agree in person,
number and gender with the arguments they cross-reference. If the verb occurs
without overt noun phrase arguments, pronominal affixes agree anaphorically
with a previously mentioned overt noun phrase argument.
   These instances of agreement are predictable from the person, number and
gender of the nominal argument. In other words, pronominal affixes never
have any semantic impact on the noun or its noun phrase. Their function is to
indicate grammatical relations in the clause and to enable construal of any
overt arguments with their respective cross-referencing affix by showing
agreement.
   In addition, there are the categories (prefix classes) established by sets of
classificatory prefixes. There are four reasons why I consider this system of
classificatory prefixes to be different from the system of gender agreement.
   First, only some verbs with similar semantics of object manipulation or
handling participate in the system of classificatory prefixes, whereas
pronominal affixes can be found on all finite verbs.
196    5. Classificatory verb prefixes   Second, nominal classification by classificatory prefixes operates on an
absolutive basis, whereas the gender system does not.
   Third, formal means and semantic categorizations used by the two
classificatory systems are quite different (see below).
   Fourth, the system of classificatory prefixes has instances of ‘non-standard
agreement’, i.e. in certain contexts, choice of the prefix is not necessarily
predictable from formal features (e.g. gender) of a noun or semantic properties
(sex, shape) of its referent. Examples of this will be provided in 5.10 below.
Within the gender system, agreement patterns are always predictable from the
gender specification of a noun.
   Phonologically, classificatory prefixes are more complex than the
pronominal affixes which define the genders. First, almost all prefixes have
prefix variants conditioned by quite diverse phonological environments.
Second, two classificatory prefixes show vowel harmony with a following
vowel (see 2.7.1).
   Note also the differences in semantic split-up. In the gender system, the
main semantic distinctions are animacy and sex, establishing a masculine, a
feminine, and two neuter genders. The distinction between the neuter genders
is mainly a formal one between those nouns with a number contrast and those
without a number contrast, though one should recall that this is not exclusively
a formal distinction but also a semantic one since an overwhelming number of
N2-nouns, such as masses, locations, and abstract or intangible entities are
non-count nouns.
   In the system of classificatory prefixes, animacy/sex is also an important
categorization criterion but the M-class and the F-class contain many items
from the inanimate world. Moreover, shape (long object) and function
(bundle-like or covering object) are criteria for classification. The residue
class mainly contains inanimate nouns which are also of neuter 1 gender, but
not exclusively so (for example a few animates such as máab tóm ‘tortoise
species’) and the residue class is not co-extensive with this gender since many
neuter 1 nouns are classified as M-class, F-class, long, bundle, or covering by
the prefix system.
   To sum up, two nominal classification systems operate alongside each
other in Mian: (a) the gender system and (b) the system of classification
through classificatory verbal prefixes. The formal means employed by the
respective systems are clearly distinct and the semantic criteria for
classification yield two different ways of categorizing nouns.
                                                      5.10. Reclassification   1975.10.     ReclassificationReclassification refers to a different categorization of a noun due to the choice
of a different classificatory prefix in order, for example, to highlight a certain
feature of the referent. Reclassification in Mian mainly applies to nouns whose
referents are or can somehow be handled like bags, for instance bundles of
firewood or substantial chunks of pork which have a string or rope attached to
them. This characteristic of the referent is not expressed in the noun, but in the
classificatory prefix. An example of reclassification by using a different
classificatory prefix is given in (27) and (28):(27)    éil=o      om-fâ-n-e=be
        pork=N2 3SG.F_CL.O-put.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He put down the (piece of) pork.’(28)    éil=o     gol-meki-n-e=be
        pork=N2 3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He hung up the (piece of) pork (on a string).’In this case, the semantic impact of the classificatory prefixes of the bundle
class is hard to miss. The information that the referent of the object, namely
the meat, comes with a string or rope attached so that it can be carried around
or hung up like a bag or bundle does not reside in the noun itself, nor is it
included in the semantics of the verb stem. It might be argued that the verb
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’ necessarily takes gol-/gulel- as a prefix because its
semantics suggest that in order to hang something up it must be bundle-like or
at least have a handle. However, sosbên, a Tok Pisin loan which refers to
metal pots of various sizes with handles, cannot occur with the bundle class
prefixes, even though the action of hanging them up can be referred to by
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’:(29)    sosbên=e     ob-meki-n-e=be / *gol-meki-n-e=be
        pot=SG.N1    3SG.RESID.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He hung up the pot.’Thus, the “hang-upability” of referents of objects of the verb -meki ‘hang up
(PFV)’ is more a selectional restriction of this verb rather than having anything
to do with the presence of the bundle class prefixes gol-/gulel-.
    In general the choice of a different prefix subtly changes the semantics of
an utterance. Compare:
198    5. Classificatory verb prefixes(30)   som=e
       banana_bunch=SG.N1       dob-meki-n-e=be
       3SG.M_CL.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up the banana bunch (e.g. the whole bunch on a nail).’(31)   som=e
       banana_bunch=SG.N1       gol-meki-n-e=be
       3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up the banana bunch (to which a string or rope is
       attached).’In (31), som=e ‘a/the banana bunch’ is reclassified as a bundle-like object.
Although the object is the same in (30) and (31), namely som=e in both cases,
the choice of prefixes indicates that in the former example the bunch of
bananas itself is hung over a hook or nail whereas in the latter example the
bunch has some string or rope attached to it, which is slipped over a hook or
nail.
   Example (31) can also have a different meaning, namely that the referent
of the object is a bag full of bananas. Bundle class prefixes can indicate that
the referent of the object is contained in a bag:(32)   tóm=e          gol-meki-n-e=be
       stone=SG.N1    3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up a bag full of stones.’If several bags are involved, the difference in number is expressed on the
article and on the verbal prefix, but the fact that the objects are in a bag is
solely conveyed by the bundle class prefix:(33)   tóm=o           gol-meki-n-e=be
       stone=PL.N1     PL.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I hung up bags full of stones.’The reclassification of a noun as bundle-like is not restricted to the verb
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’. This can be seen in the following example:
                                                       5.10. Reclassification   199(34)   mn=e            y        gol-ò-n-e=a
       child=SG.M       there     3SG.BUNLDE.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘It (the wild boar) takes the boy (with the umbilical cord), and then…’
       [Afoksitgabáam]This sentence is from a story in which a pregnant woman is savaged by a wild
boar who tears her open, takes her unborn son, still attached to the umbilical
cord (the handle, so to say), and throws him on the ground. (The whole story
can be found in the text collection in appendix 1.)
   Reclassification of yóum ‘piece of clothing’, which is by default M-class
(35), to the covering class is exemplified in (36):(35)   yóum=e                         tek      dim=e
       piece_of_clothing=SG.N1        rope     on=SG.N1       do-fâ-n-ebo=be
       3SG.M_CL.O-put.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘You put the piece of clothing on the line.’(36)   yóum=o
       piece_of_clothing=SG.N1        geme-tlâa’-n-ebo=be
        PL.COVER.O-remove.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘You undressed (lit. ‘removed your clothes).’What the reclassification of ‘clothes’ effects in this case is the highlighting of
the fact that they had covered a person’s body before they were removed, as
stated in the utterance in (36) above.
    Another example of reclassification is provided in (37):(37)            tob-ò-n-e=a
       3SG.M 3SG.LONG.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘he took it (i.e. his long penis) and then ...’ [Selimin]In this example, the classificatory prefix tob- refers anaphorically back to the
previously mentioned éit ‘penis’, which is assigned to the residue class by
default. However, in order to emphasize the enormous length of the
protagonist’s member, the speaker uses the prefix of the long class.
    All of these examples illustrate that reclassification can be used quite
creatively in Mian.
200       5. Classificatory verb prefixes5.10.1.     Plurals of inanimate nouns of neuter 1 genderThe noun éim ‘pandanus fruit’ is classified by default as belonging to the
M-class and occurs with the prefixes dob-/dol-. However, when one wants to
refer to considerable numbers of these fruits, the residue plural prefix ol- is
used. The same happens with long objects which are normally classified as
long and occur with tob-/tebel-. If their numbers exceed a few, the plural
prefix ol- of the residue class is employed:(38)      kbo       geim=o                  tebel-ubmà
          2SG.M      pronged_arrow=PL.N1     PL.LONG.O-turn_around          tebel-abmà         bi-Ø-ebo=be
          REDUP              exist.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘You are turning around (a few) pronged arrows in your hands.’(39)      kbo       geim=o                  ol-ubmà
          2SG.M      pronged arrow=PL.N1     PL.RESID.O-turn_around          olabmà     bi-Ø-ebo=be
          REDUP      exist.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘You are turning around (quite a few) pronged arrows in your hands.’
5.10.2.     Use of F-class singular om- for broken and half objectsFor inanimate referents which are broken, the prefix om- is always possible as
an alternative to the bundle, covering, long, and residue class prefixes:(40)      mén=o
          string_bag=PL.N1          gulel-halin-b-i=be
          PL.BUNDLE.O-be_concerned.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘I am concerned about the string bags.’(41)      mén-o
          string_bag=PL.N1          om-halin-b-i=be
          3SG.F_CL.O-be_concerned.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘I am concerned about the (heap of torn) string bags.’
                                                      5.10. Reclassification   201In this case, the use of the F-class singular prefix om- focuses on the fact that
the objects in question are indeed broken and thus not treated as individual
items anymore but more like a heap or a mass.
    The prefix om- is also employed for halves of formerly whole objects.
Compare:(42)   imen=e        ob-Øˆ-nen=e!
       taro=SG.N1 3SG.RESID.O-give.PFV-1SG.R=HORT
       ‘Give me the taro!’(43)   imen=e        om-Øˆ-nen=e!
       taro=SG.N1 3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-1SG.R=HORT
       ‘Give me the half taro!’Again, the examples (42) and (43) are instances of reclassification. The
semantic features ‘broken mass’ or ‘half’ are not expressed in the noun but lie
exclusively in the classificatory prefix.
Chapter 6
The noun phrase
6.0.     IntroductionMian noun phrase syntax is rigid. All noun phrases conform to the following
structural template, which specifies the structure of maximally complex noun
phrases:           Prenominal
Possessor
             adjective
                           Head     Postnominal
  Prenominal relative                              Quantifier   Determiner
                           noun     adjective(s)
        clause
  Prenominal modifierThe head noun slot can only hold an item of the category N, which includes
verbal nouns. A pronoun can instantiate a full noun phrase. Headless
adjectives can constitute a noun phrase of their own. In that case the head
noun slot is empty.
   Any material filling the possessor slot must be either a possessive pronoun
or a noun phrase. The prenominal adjective slot can accommodate one
adjective of the two sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’. The head noun can be
preceded by a prenominal relative clause or by one of two prenominal
modifiers omômom ‘all kinds of’ and inamìn ‘such’. In these cases there must
not be a possessor. The postnominal adjective slot can be filled by one or
more adjectives. Postnominal adjectives are followed by quantifiers. The
determiner slot can be filled by the article or any of those pronouns which can
be used adnominally (Himmelmann 1997: 215-219).
   Table 6.1 lists examples illustrating noun phrases of different complexity.
All of these structures are discussed below. For a short overview of relative
clauses, see 6.3.8. For a detailed description of relative clauses, see 13.3.
   The normal situation in natural Mian discourse is that the clitic article
occurs only once on the rightmost constituent of a noun phrase that is used
referentially:(1)    tíl     milil     sm=e
       dog     black     big=SG.M
       ‘a/the big, black dog’

noun phrase. It can show up on the noun itself, and on any adjectival
modifiers:(2)        tíl=e          milil=e        sm=e
           dog=SG.M black=SG.M           big=SG.M
           ‘a/the big, black dog’
6.1.         Pronouns as noun phrasesThe forms of all pronoun series (except the possessive pronoun) can be used
pronominally, i.e. they can constitute noun phrases by themselves. For details
on the form and the semantics of the respective pronoun series and for more
examples, see 3.7.
    All of these can occur in subject position. Free pronouns occasionally
occur in object position whereas the other pronoun series are so far only
attested in subject position.
    Forms from either of the reflexive series appear as objects if their function
is to indicate reflexivity:(3)        n     nmaye/neleskîl     gò’-Ø-i-obe

determiner, or a noun followed by a determiner, e.g. a clitic article or an
adnominal pronoun.","[220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231]"

1.3.        Typological profileMian has a relatively small segmental phoneme inventory though of fairly
typical shape and size by Papuan standards. An unusual feature of the
segmental inventory is the presence of a contrast between a plain /a/ (spelled
<a>) and a pharyngealized /a/ (spelled <aa>). The tonal phonology is
complex. Mian is a word tone language, i.e. the domain for the assignment of
                                                        1.3. Typological profile   7one of five tonal melodies (H, L, LH, LHL, and HL) is the phonological word,
not the syllable. Lexemes are specified for one tonal melody and an accent
which serves as the anchor point for the melody. Tonal melodies spread over
the entire phonological word including all affixes and most clitics. Verbal and
nominal compounds are treated as a single word phonologically, i.e. they have
one tonal melody (i.e. a composite of both stem tones) and one accent. The
tonal inventory of compounds is a proper subset of the tonal melodies found
on monomorphemic words. While the function of tone is mainly to make
lexical distinctions, there is one tense (the non-hodiernal past) which is
marked tonally for some verbs in addition to a suffix.
   There is hardly any nominal inflectional morphology. The only inflectional
noun suffix is -wal, which signals plural and only attaches to a subset of the
noun vocabulary to boot, namely kin nouns, dyads, and proper names, where it
indicates an associative plural. If a noun is used referentially, it is followed by
a cliticized article which is etymologically related to the third person free
pronouns. There is a tendency to use inanimate nouns without this marker,
even if they are used referentially. There are several derivational noun
suffixes which derive adverbs from nouns and express meanings like
instrumental, e.g. sbun-dum ‘with a spoon’. Furthermore, there is a
derivational suffix -an, which attaches to either nouns or adjectives to form
verbs. The meaning is inchoative, e.g. ayam ‘good’ and ayam-an- ‘become
good’. These derived forms are further inflected as intransitive verbs.
   Mian has four genders: Masculine, feminine, neuter 1 and neuter 2 which
are defined by sets of agreement markers. Agreement targets are the
adnominally used pronouns, the article and demonstratives, and the
pronominal affixes on the verb.
   The structure of the noun phrase is relatively simple and constituent order
within the noun phrase is fixed. The leftmost position is the possessor slot. It
can be filled by a possessive pronoun or a noun phrase expressing the
possessor. Most adjectival modifiers and quantifiers follow the noun. The
adjectives sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ tend to precede the noun but they can
also follow it. The rightmost position in the noun phrase is reserved for a
determiner, e.g. a clitic pronominal article or an adnominally used emphatic
pronoun. The clitic article can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and
show up on the head noun, all adjectival modifiers, and on numerals. Mian has
prenominal and head-internal relative clauses. The former are unmarked
clauses embedded in the noun phrase before the head noun, the latter are
essentially clausal noun phrases and end with a determiner, such as an article.
   Mian only has postpositions many of which have a noun origin.
   About half of the Mian verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with
formally distinct perfective and imperfective stems. This is a typical feature of
the Ok languages and also found in Telefol and Tifal. Outside of Ok, aspect
8   1. The language and its speakersdistinctions in the stem can be found in the Papuan languages Marind and
Kiwai (Foley 1986: 146-148), in Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and in Abui
(Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86). Some verb stems (approximately 50) are defective
and lack either the perfective or the imperfective stem. The rest of the verb
stems are trans-aspectual and do not have a formal perfective-imperfective
distinction.
    Verbal morphology is complex. Mian is mainly a nominative-accusative
language though in a limited number of cases argument marking proceeds on
an absolutive basis, mainly – but not exclusively – with classificatory prefixes,
which index transitive objects and intransitive subjects. Alignment in
ditransitives is indirective.
    Mian is basically head-marking at the clause level and mildly
polysynthetic. Core arguments are subject (S) in intransitive clauses, subject
(A) and object (O) in monotransitive clauses, and subject (A), object (O) and
recipient (R) in ditransitive clauses. There is no morphological case- or
adpositional marking for these. Core arguments are cross-referenced on the
verb by cross-referencing affixes. These index all subjects and recipients. The
language is not fully head-marking at the clause level because many transitive
verbs do not index their object. Object prefixation is only found in a small
number of transitive verbs, including ‘see’, ‘kill’, ‘grab’, and ‘bite’.
    In the perfective, recipient arguments are introduced through a compound
construction with -(û)b’- ‘give’, or allomorphs thereof. In contemporary Mian,
-(û)b’- ‘give’ and its allomorphs serve a quasi-applicative function. In the
imperfective, recipient suffixes immediately follow the verb stem. The notion
of ‘recipient’ is semantically relatively general and includes benefactives and
malefactives, possessors, goals of ballistic motion, and experiencers.
    In addition to the argument affixes, which work on a nominative-
accusative basis, Mian has a set of classificatory verb prefixes which are
obligatory for some verbs, most of which involve the handling or
manipulation of objects, including predications such as ‘take’, ‘throw’, ‘give’,
and ‘fall’. The classificatory prefixes classify a verbal argument according to
semantic criteria, such as biological sex but also shape and function on an
absolutive basis, i.e. classification extends to the subject of intransitive verbs
and the object of transitive verbs. These prefixes are in many ways
reminiscent of classificatory verbal elements in various North-American
languages, e.g. Navajo and Diegueño.
    Inflectional tense, aspect, and mood marking is moderately complex. The
verb has two slots for TAM suffixes which are on either side of the subject
suffix slot. The pre-subject slot is filled by various tense, aspect, and mood
markers. The post-subject slot can only be filled by tense markers (which are
formally and semantically distinct from those in the pre-subject slot). There
                                                        1.3. Typological profile   9are some co-occurrence restrictions pertaining to the suffixes in these two
slots.
    Verbs are inflected directly for some TAM categories, but for others the
verb must be serialized with an auxiliary before the respective TAM suffixes
can attach.
    Mian makes pervasive use of chaining constructions. Verbs can be
serialized at the core or the nuclear level of the clause. Serialized verbs share
the same subject which is marked on the last verb in the construction. An
exception is the causative serial verb construction, in which subject marking
indexes the causer on the first verb of the serialization and the causee on the
second verb. The predications expressed by a core serial verb constructions
are of relatively low semantic integration and serialized transitive verbs
commonly have their own overt object noun phrases. Serializations on the
nuclear level of the clause are possible. They are tighter-knit than core
serializations and do not allow separate objects.
    Clause chaining is very common in Mian. Verbs can be medial and
function as the predicate of a medial clause or final and function as the
predicate of an independent sentence or the last clause in a clause chain.
Medial verbs show switch-reference morphology indicating whether the
subject of the succeeding clause is co-referent or disjoint in reference, in
addition to marking events as sequential or simultaneous. In languages that
use clause chaining, medial verbs are often morphologically impoverished.
Mian medial verbs, however, only have the morphological restriction that they
cannot be marked for polarity, irrealis or deontic mood or be followed by one
of the sentence-final illocutionary clitics. The Mian switch-reference system
has a typologically unusual property in that ‘same subject’ marking by -n only
forces the following subject to be co-referent in the first person singular. In all
other person-number combinations the switch-reference meaning of -n is
suspended and the suffix only indicates sequentiality of events.
    Adverbial clauses with temporal, locative or conditional meaning – like
head-internal relative clauses – are clausal noun phrases and function as
referring expressions in Mian. They are followed by the default neuter article
=o. Other embedded structures found in the language are embedded questions
and quotatives.
    Unmarked constituent orders in medial and final clauses and independent
sentences are SV and AOV. Due to the head-marking characteristics of the
language, constituent order is relatively flexible with the mandatory restriction
that the verb be clause-final. The verb can only be followed by =ba, signalling
negative polarity, and/or an illocutionary clitic particle, which marks
independent sentences or whole clause chains as declarative, exclamative,
interrogative, quotative, or hortative. Post-verbal locative adverbials following
motion verbs are possible but rare and always constitute their own intonational

3.14.1.   SubjectMorphologically, the grammatical relation of subject is indexed on the verb by
a pronominal suffix in all finite verb forms:(212) haleb         -ta             te-s-e=a
      wild_boar     3SG.M-EMPH       come.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
      ‘a wild boar came and then she ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]Syntactically, the subject is the noun phrase which matches the person,
number, and in the third person also the gender value of the subject index on
the verb, in (212) haleb ta ‘the wild boar’. The subject noun phrase is not
overtly case-marked. The subject has special syntactic status in Mian because
it is the pivot of the switch-reference system of the language. Semantically,
subjects are typically topics and agents but subjects can also be experiencers
or expletives (i.e. dummy subjects in impersonal verbs). Subject suffixes are
discussed in 8.5.2.
164       3. Word classes and grammatical relations3.14.2.     ObjectMian has a single grammatical relation of object, which can be
morphologically indexed in different ways, so that the indexing patterns on the
verb do not correspond to the grammatical relations which can be established
on syntactic grounds. All objects can be modified, quantified, topicalized and
questioned. All objects can be relativized as well, but the relativization options
are subject to some restrictions for verbs which do not index their object. This
will be discussed in more detail below.
   In all cases, the object is the noun phrase which matches the person,
number, and in the third person also the gender value of the object index on
the verb. Object noun phrases are never overtly case-marked. The way objects
are indexed on the verb depends on lexical factors. There are four distinct
patterns of object indexation.
   First, the object can be marked by a pronominal prefix according to an
accusative pattern, e.g.:(213) no=i
      marsupial=PL.AN          ya-l-êt-n-e=ta
          PL.AN.O-kill.PFV-carry.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
          ‘he killed and brought/carried the marsupials and then ...’ [Crows]Semantically, objects indexed with a pronominal prefix mostly have the role
of patient.
    Second, the object can be marked by a classificatory prefix according to an
absolutive pattern, i.e. the object of a transitive verb (214) or the subject of an
intransitive verb (215) are indexed, e.g.:(214) ti=e                 báangkli=e
      blade=SG.M            stone_adze=SG.M          deb-êt-n-o=a
          3SG.M_CL.O-carry.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
          ‘she carried a báangkli adze and then ...’ [Afoksitgabáam](215) Dabein       om-mêin                   tl-Ø-o=ta
          PN       3SG.F-CL.SBJ-fall.PFV     come.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
          ‘Dabein came falling down (i.e. from the sky) and ...’ [Sofelok, 1]

of theme or patient.
    Third, the object can be marked by a pronominal suffix according to an
indirective pattern. In the perfective, the suffix must be appended to -ûb’-
‘give’, which is compounded with another verb. In the imperfective,
suffixation is directly to the stem. For a detailed description, see 8.5.5.(216) unáng=o         baa-ˆb’-o-n-e=o=le
      woman=SG.F say.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.F.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=N2=TOP
      ‘and when he said to the woman’ [Pig story]Such objects most commonly have the role of recipient, benefactive,
malefactive, possessor, or experiencer. Finally, there are verbs which never
mark their object, e.g.:(217) unín=o        dowôn’-Ø-i=a
      food=N2       eat.PFV-DS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘I eat food and then someone else ...’ [Newlyweds]In this case, there is no indicator on the verb which makes the object relation
explicit, so the object is the noun phrase which is not indexed on the verb. In
most cases animacy differences (objects of verbs without object prefix are
overwhelmingly inanimate) and the semantics and context of the whole
utterance also help identify the object. Furthermore, many verbs without an
object prefix only occur with a relatively small range of possible object noun
phrases, as in the case of halbû’ ‘fold (IPFV)’, or even only with a single
possible object noun phrase (as in the case of êi ‘accumulate, impound
(water)’ or kè ‘cut (scraped taro) into slabs’, for which the objects can only
ever be aai ‘water’ and imen nini ‘scraped taro’, respectively.
    The absence of the prefix on these verbs has a syntactic consequence.
When a verb does not index its object relativization with a prenominal relative
clause is impossible and relativization with a head-internal relative clause is
only possible if the head is not omitted. This is illustrated in the following
examples. A prenominal relative clause is not allowed when the object is not
indexed, as in (218), but is fine when it is indexed, as in (219):(218) *n     fu-n-i                    unín=o         ayam=o=be
      1SG     cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ         food=N2        good=PRD=DECL
      Intended: ‘The food I’ve cooked is good.’(219) n        a-têm’-Ø-i                         naka=e

166    3. Word classes and grammatical relations       teke=o=be
       long=PRD=DECL
       ‘The man I see is tall.’In a head-internal relative clause the head must not be left out, if the verb does
not index the object, as in (220):(220) *n     fu-n-i=o                      ayam=o=be
      1SG     cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ=N2          good=PRD=DECL
      Intended: ‘What I’ve cooked is good.’Examples (221) and (222) show that a head-internal relative clause is possible
whether the overt object noun phrase is present or not, if the verb indexes its
object.(221) n       naka=e             a-têm’-Ø-i=e
      1SG      man=SG.M           3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=SG.M       teke=o=be

       ‘The man I see is tall.’(222) n     a-têm’-Ø-i=e                                   teke=o=be
      1SG    3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=SG.M              long=PRD=DECL
      ‘The one (M) I see is tall.’If the head is present, a head-internal relative clause is possible, even if the
verb does not index its object, as in (223):(223) n      unín=o     fu-n-i=o                        ayam=o=be
      1SG     food=N2 cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ=N2               good=PRD=DECL
      ‘The food I’ve cooked is good.’The evidence suggests that relativization is only allowed, if the relativized
object is present in the clause in some way or other, either as a prefix or as an
overt noun phrase. Thus, the syntactic effect correlates with a morphological
effect, namely the presence or absence of the prefix. As this is more a
morphological issue than a syntactic one I do not see a reason why the non-
subject noun phrases of verbs like fu ‘cook’, which do not cross-reference this
noun phrase with a prefix, should not be objects.
   To sum up, Mian has one grammatical relation of object, which can be
marked in three different ways. The object can also be not marked on the verb.

Unprefixed transitive verbs are further discussed in 9.2.4.","[189, 190, 191, 192, 193]"
"
3.14.3.   DitransitivesMian allows ditransitives to be derived from monotransitives in a highly
productive way. The three arguments are the subject and two objects. In
almost all cases, one of the objects is morphologically indexed by a prefix
(following an accusative or absolutive pattern) and one object is indexed by a
suffix (following an indirective pattern). For a detailed description of
ditransitives, see section 9.5.
Chapter 4
Gender
4.0.      IntroductionMian, like the closely related Ok languages Telefol and Tifal, has a category
‘gender’, i.e. nouns are lexically specified for the gender they are assigned to
and require the agreement patterns associated with their gender (Corbett 1991,
Aikhenvald 2000). Mian has four genders: Masculine (M), feminine (F), neuter
1 (N1), and neuter 2 (N2).
    Although gender is a nominal category, gender distinctions surface as
formal variation on agreeing categories, the agreement targets, which are
different from the noun. In Mian, agreeing categories within the noun phrase
are articles and determiners. Outside the noun phrase, pronominal affixes on
the verb, i.e. subject, object, and recipient markers, agree in gender with any
overtly realized arguments. In anaphoric agreement, pronouns and pronominal
affixes also agree in gender with a noun in a previously mentioned overt noun
phrase argument.
    Mian does not mark gender overtly on the noun, i.e. there is no nominal
affix indicating the gender of a noun. I follow Corbett (1991: ch. 6), who
treats genders as formally defined by sets of agreement markers and not by
formal properties of the noun. In order to be able to say that a language has
gender, some formal marker has to be present on at least one category
different from the noun, which systematically covaries with the gender of the
noun (Corbett 1991: 105).","[193, 194, 195]"
"
6.6.     Dyadic termsDyadic terms are a subclass of the word class of nouns. They refer to a social
or a kin relationship between two or more people and encode relational
opposites (Evans 2003a, 2006). They can function as heads of noun phrases
which in turn are arguments of the predicate in the same clause. An example is
given in (69):
224    6. The noun phrase(69)   dab=i                                 y

       ‘after the brothers had left it (as it was), one of them…’ [Danenok]Most frequently, dyads occur with a plural possessive pronoun which refers to
the whole set of individuals described by the dyad. The possessive pronoun
has appositive meaning:(70)   b           mikim
       2PL.POSS     opposite_sex_siblings(dyad)
       ‘you, brother and sister’The reason why I analyse the dyad as the noun phrase head with a possessive
pronoun in the possessor slot and not as a noun phrase apposed to a free
pronoun (an analysis suggested by the English translation I have chosen for
example (70) is because the pronoun forms are clearly from the possessive
pronoun series:(71)   *bo     mikimIn (71) the free personal pronoun cannot be used, cf. also nb mikim ‘we
(INCL), brother and sister’ and unacceptable *nbo mikim. I assume that the
possessive analysis is extended to the cases where the possessive pronoun is
homophonous with the free pronoun:(72)                   mikim
       3PL.AN.POSS      opposite_sex_siblings(dyad)
       ‘they, brother and sister’ [MPI Reciprocals clip 1]Dyads can be preceded by a proper name or kin noun, which is in an
appositional relation with the dyad, forming an inclusory construction.
Reference is to the dyad of individuals, only one of which is explicitly named.

6.7.        Noun phrase coordinationMian has four strategies for the coordination of noun phrases:-      juxtaposition
-      coordination with =sa ‘too’
-      coordination by =a ‘and’
-      coordination by eka ‘and’All of these strategies are available for animate and inanimate nouns alike.
Coordination by juxtaposition shows a maximum of two coordinated noun
phrases in the corpus whereas there is no upper limit of coordinated noun
phrase for the other two strategies.
    The simplest strategy of noun phrase coordination is juxtaposition.
Coordination by juxtaposition is mainly used if the referents of the coordinate
noun phrases are relatively low in individuation. Examples (77) and (78)
illustrate this for animates and inanimates, respectively:(77)      naka homòn     unáng     homòn=i
          man many       woman     many=AN.PL
          ‘many men and many women’ [Sofelok, 2]
226    6. The noun phrase(78)   db=o          ket=o
       seed=N1.PL blossom=N1.PL
       ‘seeds and blossoms’ [Sofelok, 1]Coordination by juxtaposition is not available with noun phrases referring to
individuals or singular entities in subject or object position. However,
juxtaposition of proper names occurs in the possessor position:(79)   Fitibkanib=o Dimoson                        wengsâng=o
       PN=SG.F           PN          3PL.AN.POSS story=N2
       ‘the story of Fitibkanib and Dimosson’ [Fitibkanib and Dimosson]Givón (1990: 497) notes that noun phrases which are conjoined by simple
juxtaposition often yield unified group lexical items. Wälchli (2005) calls
compounds whose component parts refer to stereotypically conjoined entities
additive co-compounds. Mian has a few such lexical items, e.g. alél-melel (lit.
wife-offspring) ‘(core) family’ and awók-aalok ‘adults, parents’, consisting of
awók ‘mother’ and a cranberry morph -aalok without any synchronically
establishable meaning. Although these were probably formed by juxtaposition
and at least partially have become semantically opaque, noun phrase
juxtaposition synchronically is a syntactic device forming coordinate noun
phrases without any tendency for lexicalization.
   The second coordination strategy involves the clitic noun phrase modifier
=sa ‘too’, which attaches to each coordinate noun phrase. Coordinate noun
phrases can refer to individuals (80) or to groups (81). The coordinated noun
phrases are bracketed:(80)   [Kasening     ]=sa         [Albet    ]=sa          y

                                            6.7. Noun phrase coordination   227The third coordination strategy uses the clitic =a ‘and’ (presumably a
shortened form of eka ‘and’), which cliticizes to each noun phrase in the
coordinate structure, as in (82) and (83) or just appears once on the rightmost
member of the coordination, as in (84). Note that the order of the article and
the coordinator on the last coordinated member is reversed. Reversal does not
take place if the last noun in the coordination ends in /a/, as in (83):(82)   naka=ya unáng=a=i
       man=and woman=and=PL.AN
       ‘(the) men and women’ [Dimosson](83)   tn=a        unáng=a      naka=i=a

       ‘brothers and husbands’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]An example of an inanimate noun phrase coordinated with =a ‘and’ is
provided in (85):(85)   n=a         kakab=a       bobol=a=o
       liver=and lungs=and heart=and=PL.N1
       ‘liver, lungs, and heart’ [Crows]Instead of =a ‘and’ one also finds eka ‘and’ in noun phrase coordination. The
coordinated noun phrases appear in square brackets:(86)   [Memin    i=e]       eka [Daning       i=e]       eka

       ‘he himself and Bokolfet’s younger brother too’ [Mianmin and
       Telefomin]
228    6. The noun phraseThe conjunction eka ‘and’ is also used for the coordination of adjectival
modifiers within a single noun phrase. The first adjective in such a
coordination must not have a distributed article, as in example (88):(88)   sob=e           sm(*=e)          eka   tekebmín   le
       soap=SG.N1 big(*=SG.N1)           and   long       DEM.PROX.SG.N1
       ‘this big and long (bar of) soap’
6.8.     Noun phrase appositionIn my analysis of noun phrase apposition in Mian I follow Rijkhoff (2002),
who defines appositional modifiers as “all those elements which semantically
speaking serve the same purpose as their non-apposed […] counterparts, but
which from a syntactic point of view are not part of the […] phrase containing
the head noun. An obvious requirement of any apposed modifier phrase is co-
reference: it must refer to the same entity as the other member(s) in the
appositional construction” (p. 22).
   Appositive noun phrases always follow the noun phrase to which they are
apposed. Typical examples include apposition of a proper name, as in (89) and
(90), specification of a profession (91), and a reflexive pronoun with
contrastive function (92). In the following examples, the appositional
modifiers are separated by a comma.(89)   n           imak=e,             Nialiaaleb=e

a pronoun, for example a demonstrative:

       Telefomin]
6.9.     Noun phrase topicalizationTopic-marking in Mian is done with the topic clitic =le which attaches to
noun phrases, including free pronouns. I analyse =le as a clitic rather than an
affix because it not only attaches to pronouns but can mark topical adverbial
clauses and medial clauses in clause chains as well. Topical constituents with
=le are intonationally detached from the following clause.
    Topic marking with =le is incompatible with emphatic pronouns, which
are used for focus (see 6.10), e.g. *-ta=le [3SG.M-EMPH=TOP].
    Topic-only question are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is
mentioned. The speaker has a particular question in mind, and it must be
obvious from the context what the implied question is, such as I’m going. And
you? (Implied: Are you going as well?). Two examples are given below:(94)   kbo=le?
       2SG.M=TOP
       ‘What about you?’ (Possible implication: ‘What are you doing?’,
       ‘What do you want to eat?’)(95)   Mandat    =le?
       PN        3SG.M=TOP
       ‘What about Milsen?’ (Possible implication: ‘What’s Milsen doing?’
       ‘Where is Milsen?’)Topic marking is commonly found in personal introductions (|| marks an
intonational break in all examples in this section):(96)   n=le         ||  Dabein       n-ta=bo
       1SG=TOP           PN           1SG-EMPH=QUOT
       ‘ “As for me, Dabein that’s me.” ’ [Dimosson]Subjects can be topicalized with =le, as in the following excerpts from an
account of traditional initiation, where the topic is given:
230    6. The noun phrase(97)   [...] ‘Adults would line the side of the path. Others (also adults)
       would lead the boys who are to be initiated, and they (i.e. the boys)
       walked along the path ...’       tam                 =le             ||
       here_sideways        PL.AN=TOP       was=o             ol-ò-n-ib=a

       ‘as for the ones on the side (i.e. the adults), they take drums and ...’
       [Initiation rituals]This bit of discourse contains two groups of adults, as opposed to the boys,
one group lining the path, the other leading the boys. The topic pronoun is
here used to establish the first group of adults as the topic of the new clause.
    Topics are typically given information but this is not necessarily the case,
as in the following example where an object is topicalized which has not been
previously mentioned in the discourse:(98)   memé          =le               ||        Sobining=e
       children      PL.AN=TOP                    PN=SG.M       dl-êt-n-e=a

       ‘As for the children, Sobining took them and ...’ [Sobining]Multiple topicalized constituents can often be found as discourse openers (de
Vries 2005). In the following example, the first topic yomin=o=le is a more
general topic of the whole narrative, set up here as a discourse frame by the
speaker:(99)   yomin=o=le              ||   yangpela=i=le                    ||
       initiation=N2=TOP            young_ones(TP)=PL.AN=TOP       alukûm          dli     tat-n-ib=a

       ‘As for the initiation, the young ones, they went downriver and
       then ...’ [Initation rituals]
                                               6.10. Focused noun phrases   2316.10.    Focused noun phrases“[F]ocus is the most important or salient piece of information in the utterance,
as perceived by the speaker. [...] The focus [...] always presents new
information, though new relative to the topic, not necessarily new in the
discourse” (Siewierska 2004: 159).
   Focus in Mian is marked by using an emphatic pronoun, etc., i.e. a bound
pronominal form suffixed with the emphatic pronoun suffix -ta (see 3.7.4)
Marking of focus is characteristic of Papuan languages in general, contrary to
fixed positional encoding in European languages, where focus is associated
with clause-final position (Foley 2000: 387-8).
   Contrastive focus in Mian is generally expressed by using emphatic
pronouns. Two examples are given below:(100)           Asuneb=e=mo        a-têm’-Ø-e=ba=be
      3SG.M      PN=SG.M=NEG        3SG.M.O-see-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=DECL                Beitab     -ta

        ‘the husband went to sit down at pig fruits (to ambush pigs), the wife

questions (see 10.1.3). When there is a choice between two alternatives, each
232    6. The noun phraseexpressed by a noun phrase, both are in contrastive focus and emphatic
pronouns have to be used, as in the following example:(102) kbo           éil    -ta             bleka        aning      -ta
      2SG.M          pig    SG.M-EMPH        or           fish       SG.M-EMPH       dowôn’-aamab-eb=a?
       eat-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=Q
       ‘Do you want to eat pork or fish?’On completive focus in content questions with wan ‘who’, see 10.2.7.
  Focus marking is used in comparisons. I recorded example (103) as the
Mian translation of the English sentence “Port Moresby is bigger that
Vanimo” (|| indicates an intonational break):(103) Mosbi      =le             || sm    eka      Banimo       -ta
       PN        SG.N2=TOP           big    and      PN           SG.N2-EMPH       gwáab=o=be
       small=PRD=DECL
       ‘(As for) Port Moresby (, it) is big, and Vanimo is small.’This example consists of a topical noun phrase ‘Port Moresby’, set off
intonationally from the rest of the utterance, and a comment which actually
predicates something about this topic. The comparative element is focused
with -ta, but the statement, which prima facie seems to be about Vanimo, is in
effect a statement about the topic Port Moresby.
Chapter 7
The postpositional phrase
7.0.     IntroductionPostpositional phrases are adverbial adjuncts which fulfil a variety of
functions, such as situating an event spatially or temporally, or specifying an
instrument involved in an action. Postpositional phrases in Mian are always
syntactically optional. They provide additional adverbial information but their
omission never renders a clause syntactically incomplete.
   Postpositions can be simple or complex. An example of a simple
postposition is (1). Simple postpositions typically encliticize if their
complement is bare, as in (2):(1)    naka    -ta             baka
       man     PL.AN-EMPH       with       hâa’-bi-Ø-ob=a

       ‘while she was curing (them, i.e. frogs) with a torch there,
       someone else ...’ [Crows]Complex postpositions either consist of two or three combined postpositions,
e.g. tabáab-tem-daak [beneath-in(to)-down] ‘down underneath’, as in (3), or
they are denominal derivations formed by suffixing -daa ‘at’ to a noun (see
3.1.5), as in (4):(3)    hàs=e              tabáab-tem-daak
       hat(TP)=SG.N1      beneath-in(to)-down
       ‘down underneath the hat’(4)    as=e              dáang-daa
       tree=SG.N1        back-at
       ‘at the back of the tree (i.e. the side hitting the ground first when
       the tree is felled)’
234    7. The postpositional phrase7.1.     Simple spatial postpositional phrases with a directionalThese consist of one noun phrase without a determiner and one directional
postposition. The inventory of directionals comprises:(5)    ut          ‘up(wards)’
       daak        ‘down(wards)’
       met         ‘up(river)’
       tab         ‘down(river)’
       tm         ‘sideways, at the same level’
       wt         ‘across’For every postpositional phrase, there is an allative and a locative
interpretation:(6)    kim=daak              to-fâ-n-e=a

       ‘he grabbed (across) his wife’s hand’ [Flood]There are some structures which show that directionals when used as
postpositions do not follow nouns but noun phrases. In (9), the complement is
a noun phrase consisting of a possessor and a noun head. In (10), the
complement is a nominalisation unin ‘activitiy of ingesting’ with its object aa
‘water’:(9)    hen            tab                tem-Ø-e=a

                 7.1. Simple spatial postpositional phrases with a directional   235       [kwin=i           bibam] NP tab=o

       ‘he was seeking (for his wife), he looked downriver, downriver at the

       ‘down at the water drinking (place), a large tree broke down and then
       they …’ [Flood]The noun phrase serving as a complement of a directional never has an article
or any other adnominal determiner nor can it be followed by adjectival
modifiers:(11)   *Skiobib=o=tab
       PN=N2=downriver
       Intended: ‘downriver at/to Skiobib’The postpositional phrase can optionally be followed by an article. In this case
the postposition does not cliticize. The article can agree in gender and number
with the noun in the preceding complement. The following two examples
show that the article following the postposition agrees in gender and number
with kakam ‘buttocks, butt’ (gender: N1) and tibín ‘river head’ (gender: N2),
respectively:(12)   kakam            tab=e             […]     ge-n-e=a
       buttocks(N1) down=SG.N1            [...]   tie.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘he tied (it) down at the buttocks’ [Selimin](13)   ut-n-ib=a                         Sek     tibín                   ut=o
       up-SS.SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED        PN      river_head(N2)          up=N2
       ‘they ascended, up to the head of the river Sek’ [Flood]Gender agreement of the article is mostly disregarded and =o is used
regardless of the gender of the noun, thus instead of kakam tab=e ‘down at the
buttocks’ in (12) one also finds kakam tab=o. The article =o also marks
temporal nouns (see 3.1.9) and adverbial clauses (see 13.2) and is a default
marker for all adverbial adjuncts.
236    7. The postpositional phrase    The phrases kakam tabe and Sek tibín uto in (12) and (13) might look like
noun phrases as far as their internal syntax is concerned because they end in
an article. But in simple postpositional phrases with a directional only the
article is allowed. Noun phrases allow the full range of adnominally used
pronouns (see 6.2.3).","[249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262]"
"
13.3.1.     Prenominal relative clausesPrenominal relative clauses are clausal modifiers embedded into the noun
phrase. They always precede their head noun, e.g. in (36), where the subject is
relativized:(36)      balubib=y        mâa’-bl-Ø-ib
          airstrip=at       stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ          naka=i
          man=PL.AN
          ‘the men who are standing at the airstrip’Here, a clause balubib=y mâa’blib ‘they are standing at the airstrip’ precedes
its head noun naka=i ‘the men’. Postcedent identification is made possible by
both the morphology and the syntax. While the syntax dictates that the noun
following the relative clause is the head noun, there is additional information
from agreement in the pronominal marking on the verb. In (36) above, for
example, the verb mâa’blib ‘they are standing’ is marked -ib agreeing with the
postcedent in the (animate) plural.
    With prenominal relative clauses, the head noun must not be left out.
Hence, example (37) is ungrammatical:
                                                         13.3. Relative clauses   501(37)    *balubib=y         mâa’-bi-Ø-ib

        PL.AN.O-see.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
        Intended: ‘I’m looking at them who are standing at the airstrip.’The verb in the relative clause is a final verb. It is not subject to any limits in
terms of its morphology. It can, for instance, be inflected for tense, as in (38)
or mood in (39):(38)    balubib    klâ-Ø-ib-bio                            naka=i
        airstrip   build-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ-GPST            man=PL.AN
        ‘the men who built the airstrip’ [Observed](39)    yo-n-omab-ib                                        am=o

        ‘the house in which they will initiate’ [Initiation rites]The head noun is only allowed to appear in a reduced form in the relative
clause itself, namely as a cross-referencing affix on the verb. Under no
circumstances can a prenominal relative clause have an overt noun phrase,
either a full noun phrase (40) or a free pronoun (41), co-referent with, and
with the same grammatical function as the head noun. This restriction is cross-
linguistically common (Comrie 1981: 140):(40)    *naka=e  balubib=y           mâa’-bi-Ø-e
        man=SG.M airstrip=at          stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ        naka=e

        Intended: ‘the man who is standing at the airstrip’(41)    *         balubib=y       mâa’-bi-Ø-e

502    13. EmbeddingThe restriction that the relative clause must not contain an overt repetition of
the postcedent becomes more obvious when we consider an example in which
the object is relativized, e.g. (42):(42)   n      a-têm’-Ø-i                             naka=e
       1SG     3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ           man=SG.M
       ‘the man whom I saw’In this case, overt repetition of the postcedent inside the relative clause also
yields an ungrammatical result: *n naka=e a-têm’-i naka=e.
    This shows that prenominal relative clauses are prone to a restriction which
is irrelevant in simple declarative sentences (or in any clause in a clause chain,
for that matter), where an overt object noun phrase, such as naka=e, can
always occur despite the fact that it is already indexed on the verb by a prefix:(43)   n       naka=e         a-têm’-Ø-i=be
       1SG      man=SG.M       3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I saw the man.’Relativization of the recipient object is possible (44). The theme object can be
relativized as well (45).(44)   buk=o
       book(TP)=N2       om-ûb’-a-n-amab-i
       3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-AUX.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ       naka=e

       book(TP)=N2
       ‘the book that I will give to the man’
                                                      13.3. Relative clauses   503There is one example in the corpus where a location is relativized. This is
given in (46):(46)   yo-n-omab-ib                                         am=o
       initiate-AUX.PFV-IRR.PL.AN.SBJ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ          house=N2
       ‘the house in which they will initiate’ [Initiation rites]The interpretation of am=o ‘the house’ as a locative is not overtly indicated in
(46) but it is the only plausible one given the semantics of the verb and the
head noun. Houses are not likely to be initiated nor are they commonly
beneficiaries of initiation procedures.
   A noun phrase containing a prenominal relative clause can have all the
roles also available to a noun phrase which is not modified by a relative
clause, i.e. appear in subject, object, and possessor position, and as the only
argument in a non-verbal clause (47):(47)   balubib=y        mâa’-bi-Ø-e
       airstrip=at       stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ       naka=e      teke=o=be
       man=SG.M    tall=PRD=DECL
       ‘The man who is standing at the airstrip is tall.’Finally, we want to determine what structure an utterance consisting of a
prenominal relative clause and its head noun has. Consider example (48):(48)   balubib=y     mâa’-bi-Ø-e                                    naka=e
       airstrip=at    stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ           man=SG.M
       ‘the man who is standing at the airstrip’The clause balubib y mâa’bie ‘he was standing at the airstrip’ used as a
prenominal relative clause in (48) does not have a relative pronoun. There is
no overt marking of the clause as subordinate. Nor is there any marking which
indicates that prenominal relative clauses in Mian function as noun phrases
themselves. In Yimas (Foley 1991), relative clauses, which can precede or
follow their head noun or appear without it, usually bear the ‘near distal’
marker m-, which marks the whole relative clause as a definite referring
expression. In addition to that, Yimas relative clauses obligatorily take a class
and number suffix which marks them as noun phrases and indicates the head
noun modified by the relative clause (from Foley 1991: 413):1
504       13. Embedding(49)      kray         m-ka-tu-r-
          frog.VI.SG    NR.DIST-1SG.A-kill-PFV-VI.SG
          ‘the frog which I killed’The absence of any marking on the Mian prenominal relative clause suggests
that we are not dealing with a noun phrase in apposition with the head noun
here but rather with a clause embedded into the noun phrase as a modifer.
Neither do we have a clause which is clearly marked as subordinate to a
matrix clause.
   Furthermore, it is not possible for a noun phrase to contain either sin ‘old’
or memâ ‘new’ in prenominal position plus a prenominal relative clause.
Consider the ungrammatical example (50):(50)      *balubib=y       mâa’-bi-Ø-e
          airstrip=at       stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ          sin    naka=e
          old    man=SG.M
          Intended: ‘the old man who is standing at the airstrip’
13.3.2.     Head-internal relative clausesUnlike prenominal relative clauses, in which the head noun is only referred to
by pronominal marking on the verb but occurs outside the clause (as its head),
in head-internal relative clauses the head noun is usually expressed overtly
within the clause but no mention of it must be made outside the clause.
    Head-internal relative clauses are obligatorily marked with a range of
pronominal determiners, among them the article, all of which are also used to
mark non-relativized noun phrases. Thus, they essentially function as noun
phrases occupying the argument position the head noun of the relative clause
has in the matrix clause. A head-internal relative clause can function within
the matrix clause as the subject, the object, the possessor, or the only argument
in a non-verbal clause. Consider example (51), in which a head-internal
relative clause functions as the object of the main clause:(51)      naka=i           balubib=y
          man=PL.AN        airstrip=at          mâa’-bl-Ø-ib=i
          stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=PL.AN
                                                     13.3. Relative clauses   505       ya-temê’-b-i=be
       PL.AN.O-see.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I am looking at the men who are standing at the airstrip’In this example sentence, the whole head-internal relative clause nakai
balubib y mâa’blibi bears the article =i ‘plural animate’ identical to the one
which marks the subject noun phrase nakai ‘the men’.
    It is common for relative clauses (and subordinate clauses in general) in
Papuan languages to behave morphologically like definite noun phrases
(Foley 1986: 202-204). This similarity in form is parallel to their similarity in
function as definite referring expressions: “Definite noun phrases presuppose
the prior identification of their referent […]. Subordinate clauses presuppose
the prior identification of the events they describe” (p. 202).
    Head-internal relative clauses are marked with those pronominal elements
that are also used to mark nouns. In normal non-relativized noun phrases, an
article or some other determiner has to occur if the noun phrase is definite (or
indefinite) referential and is left out if the noun phrase is indefinite non-
referential. Likewise, head-internal relative clauses always have to have a
determiner, e.g. an article, precisely because they are definite referring
expressions.
    Sometimes the article at the right edge of the head-internal relative clause
does not show on the surface. This is the case when the verb of the relative
clause ends in a vowel identical to the article, as in (52):(52)   naka=e         balubib=y
       man=SG.M       airstrip=at       mâa’-bi-Ø-e=e
       stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=SG.M
       ‘the man who is standing at the airstrip’In this example, the article =e coalesces with the subject suffix -e because
they are identical consecutive vowels. The result is a single vowel. Thus, the
verb is pronounced [ma..]. I assume that the article in example (52) is
present underlyingly, rather than claim that some head-internal relative clauses
do not have articles and thereby obscuring the important syntactic distinction
of head-internal relatives from prenominal relative clauses (see 13.3.1), which
never have a determiner.
   In head-internal relative clauses the following positions can be relativized:
subject (51) above, prefixed object of a transitive clause (53), non-indexed
object (54), prefixed object (theme) of a ditransitive clause (55), and suffixed
object (recipient) of a ditransitive clause (56).

13.3.3.     Omission of the internal head in head-internal relative clausesSo far, in all examples of head-internal relative clauses, the head noun features
as a full noun phrase. However, this need not be the case, and in textual
example omission of the internal head of a head-internal relative clause is
frequent.
   The internal head can be freely omitted, if the subject is relativized, as in
(57) or (58), yielding a headless head-internal relative clause.

6.2.3.     Emphatic pronouns as noun phrase determinersApart from the pronominal clitic article, the function of the determiner can be
served by an emphatic pronoun (see section 3.7.4), which is used adnominally.
The following examples illustrate the use of emphatic pronouns in noun
phrases which consist solely of an adjective (13) or a numeral (14):(13)     gwáab        -ta             deb-êt-n-i=ta
         small        SG.M-EMPH        3SG.M_CL.O-take-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED

         one.M       SG.M-EMPH
         ‘the one (alone)’The next examples illustrate the use of emphatic pronouns in simple noun
phrases with a single noun and more complex noun phrases, i.e. noun phrases
with a head noun and at least one modifier. On modified noun phrases, see
section 6.4.(15)     aab       -ta

         ‘the foot proper detached and came falling down’ [Crows]In natural Mian discourse, all adnominally used pronouns can optionally form
one phonological unit with the preceding word. Thus, we find aab ta ‘the
brother (EMPH)’ pronounced [aph] [ .ta] and aab=ta [a. .ta] also with
the meaning ‘the brother (EMPH)’. This behaviour is different from that of
articles which (almost) always cliticize. Suprasegmentally, however,
adnominally used emphatic pronouns and articles are very similar. If one of
the former cliticizes to the noun, its high tone can disappear. Thus, we not
only find aab=ta [a. .ta] but also aab=eta [a..ta] with no difference in
meaning. This alternation is exactly parallel to the free variation between
naka= [na.ka. ] with a high-toned article and naka=e [na.ka.], where the
article is unspecified for tone, both with the meaning ‘a/the man’.","[232, 233, 234]"
"
3.13.4.    The negative clitic =moThe negative clitic =mo is used in clauses that are negated with =ba ‘negation’
and prohibitives (see 8.6.7.6). It cannot be used in negated non-verbal
predications. =Mo typically encliticizes to the final constituent before the
verb. It can occur as a free word clause-initially. Examples of =mo in
declaratives can be found in 3.13.3 above. An example of the prohibitive is
given in (201):(201) mo         dob-ski
          NEG    3SG.M_CL.O-turn          dob-ski-n-em-eb=e!

          ‘Do not keep turning him (a male child) around!’ [Crows]If the negated verb consists of a coverb and a function verb in case of a
function-verb construction, =mo attaches to the final constituent before the
whole predicate, which includes the coverb accompanying a function verb. An
example is:

      ‘I don’t know.’
3.13.5.       The interrogative clitic =mThe interrogative clitic =m is employed in polar questions (see 10.1.1). Like
negative =mo, interrogative =m typically encliticize to the final constituent
before the verb (or the coverb in case of a function-verb construction) but can
occur as a free word clause-initially. An example is (204):(204) m          wentê-b-eb=ta                           o-b-i

          (Lit: ‘Are you hearing as I’m saying, or?’) [Mianmin and Telefomin]
3.13.6.       The topic clitic =leThe topic clitic =le attaches to preceding noun phrases and adverbial and
medial clauses to indicate their topicality. The reader is referred to later
sections for examples and more detailed information on topicalized noun
phrases (6.9), topicalized medial clauses (11.3), and topicalized adverbial
clauses (13.2.5). An example of a topicalized noun phrase is (205):(205) memé               =le              ||   Sobining=e
      children           PL.AN=TOP              PN=SG.M          dl-êt-n-e=a

noun phrases to express the notion that something which is expressed in the
same sentence or which is obvious from the context also applies to the referent
of the noun phrase. This is illustrated for a first and second person singular
pronoun in (206) and (207), respectively, and for a noun phrase in subject,
(206) and (207), and object position (208) and (209):(206) n=sa       klayâm             bl-Ø-i=be

          ‘they put the leaf (bag) too down between (them) as well’ [Danenok]Prima facie it might look that =sa ‘too’ is another suffix which derives
complex pronouns from simple ones, like -ta derives emphatic pronouns
(3.7.4). However, consider the following example which shows that if sa was
a pronoun suffix, we would not expect it to follow the topic clitic, which
marks noun phrases as topicalized not just noun:(210) y le        li=le=sa                      besa     y

          Telefomin]
3.13.8.     Interjections and formulaic utterancesInterjections are particles which express assent or dissent, emotional states,
and hesitation in speech. Due to the fact that interjections are usually uttered
with a marked intonation, and the difficulty of teasing apart lexical tone and
intonation, I will not mark tone on interjections. The inventory comprises:(211) ae, ai                               ‘yes’
      ayasi                                ‘expressing surprise or disbelief’
      ayo                                  ‘sorry (feeling regret or pity)’
      ba (< baa ‘say’)                     ‘ehm (hesitation in speech)’
      dowe                                 ‘boah man’
      ekskyus (from Tok Pisin)             ‘excuse me’
      klâye                                ‘well now’
      o                                    ‘oh’
      yait, yaiks (from Tok Pisin)         ‘yuck’
      yle, yle                           ‘well (also hesitation)’
      yeye                                 ‘no’The interjection ayo can only express regret and is not used for apologies.
   I think it is plausible that ba ‘ehm’ indicating hesitation goes back to the
verb stem baa ‘say (PFV)’. As bare verb stems are commonly used as
imperatives, it is conceivable that speakers used the imperative form baa
[mbà] ‘Say (it)!’ to “order themselves” to continue speaking. Synchronically,
however, the interjection ba is not pronounced with a pharyngealized /a/.
   In the eastern dialect, there are no interjections for the purpose of greeting
people. Instead whole formulaic sentences are exchanged. The following
patterns of question and answer are customary:Arriving party says:                         Customary answer:
bo y bliba? — ‘Are you (PL) there?’        ae, n y biobobe — ‘Yes, we are there.’
klayâm bieba? — ‘Are you well?’              ae, klayâm blibe — ‘Yes, I am well.’Departing party says:                        Customary answer:

kbo y tleba? — ‘You have come to         (ae,) y tlibe ‘(Yes,) I have come to this
this place.’                               place?’In the western dialect area, the form klayâmo ‘really good’ is commonly used
to say hello or bid farewell to somebody. Speakers of the eastern dialect do
not have this convention.","[185, 186, 187, 188, 189]"

3.10.     QuantifiersThe class of quantifiers comprises homòn ‘many, much’, alukûm ‘all, every,
each’, and alik ‘all, every, each’, plus all numerals. Numerals and homòn
‘many, much’ always follow the noun that is being counted and all its
adjectival modifiers. The quantifiers alukûm and alik can occur before or after
the noun phrase they quantify.
    Mian does not have a set of formally distinct ordinal numbers nor does it
allow the use of cardinal numbers as ordinals.
    Basic numerals are:(156) elekiêm~eleyêm           ‘one (M, N1)’
      olokiêm~oloyêm           ‘one (F, N2)’
      asú/asusûna              ‘two’
      asumâtna                 ‘three’The pronouns from the free ‘alone’-series elekiêm (also eleyêm) ‘only he/it
alone’ and olokiêm (also oloyêm) ‘only she/it alone’ (see 3.7.7) double as the
numeral ‘one’, depending on gender. The numeral obligatorily agrees in
gender with the noun which is being counted:(157) naka=e        elekiêm
      man=SG.M      one.M
      ‘one man’ OR ‘only the man alone’(158) unáng=o         olokiêm
      woman=SG.F      one.F
      ‘one woman’ OR ‘only the woman alone’The numerals asú ‘two’ and asumâtna ‘three’ can occur with an article
reflecting the number and the gender of the counted noun but are often bare.
Asú ‘two’ has a variant asusûna, which looks like a partial reduplication of the
simple numeral asú. Nonetheless, asusûna also means ‘two’ rather than ‘four’:
                                                        3.10. Quantifiers   145(159) unáng=i               asú(=ei)/asusûna(=i)
      woman=PL.AN           two
      ‘two women’The numeral asusûna ‘two’ is (at least historically) segmentable into the
(partially reduplicated) numeral asusû and na. The latter is possibly derived
from the verb na ‘do’. Thus, asusûna ‘two’ would have been a verbal
predicate meaning ‘are two (lit. ‘do two’)’. The same holds for asumâtna
’three’, which consists of asú ‘two’, mak ‘(an)other’ and na ‘do’. Hence,
asumâtna probably used to mean ‘be two and another’:(160) unáng=i              asumâtna(=i)
      woman=PL.AN          three(=PL.AN)
      ‘three women’ (lit. ‘two women and another’)As the element na in numerals synchronically cannot be inflected as a verb, I
do not see any plausible reason to analyse the Mian numerals asusûna ‘two’
and asumâtna ‘three’ as verbs. I assume that the erstwhile verb stem na ‘do’ is
synchronically a part of the lexemes asusûna ‘two’ and asumâtna ‘three’.
   The numerals asú ‘two’, asusûna ‘two’, and asumâtna ‘three’ can be
collocated with the function verb ke ‘do’ to express that a group consists of a
certain number of individuals:(161)       Klefolam asú ke-bl-Ø-io=be
      3PL    PN           two do-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL

        play-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
       ‘They are three of them playing.’ (lit. ‘They are three and they
       are playing.’)The numerals for numbers larger than three are phrasal. The rationale for
forming such phrasal numerals is stringing together instances of asú=ke ‘two
and’ (i.e. the numeral asú ‘two’ plus the light verb ke ‘do’ serving as a
coordinator in phrasal numerals) as many times as needed to count to an even
number and rounding this off by make ‘(one) other’ for odd numbers.
Examples are:
146    3. Word classes and grammatical relations(163) asúke asúke               ‘four’       [two+two]
      asúke asúke make          ‘five’       [two+two+another]
      asúke asúke asúke         ‘six’        [two+two+two]Phrasal numerals can occur with na, as in (164), or without na, as in (165),
depending on whether they are followed by the article, which is always
optional for numerals. Compare:(164) memé(=i)                asú=ke     asú=ke make          na=i
      children(=PL.AN)        two=and two=and another do=PL.AN
      ‘five children’ (lit. ‘two and two children and another’)(165) unáng=i              asú=ke      asú=ke
      woman=PL.AN          two=and     two=and
      ‘four women’ (lit. ‘two and two women’)With regard to example (164), memé(=i) asú=ke asú=ke make ‘five children’
would also be possible, but not *memé(=i) asú=ke asú=ke mak=i because
phrasal numerals are fixed expressions. For odd numbers the form make
‘(an)other’ is used regardless of the gender of the counted entity. The segment
// in make is an article indicating gender but it has frozen in the form for the
third person singular.
    In asumâtna ‘three’ [< asú mak na ‘two another do’] the final consonant in
mak ‘other’ has assimilated in place of articulation to the following nasal. It
seems that synchronically asumâtna is not analysed as asú ‘two’ and mak
‘other’ anymore. Especially younger speakers also use asú=ke make for
‘three’ (lit. ‘two and another’), thus regularizing the rules for counting to
include ‘three’.
    It is not difficult to see how this counting method can get quite
cumbersome very quickly for the speakers, who nowadays operate with large
exact numbers on a regular basis. Consequently, Tok Pisin numerals have
replaced the traditional ones, roughly from six upwards, e.g.:(166) memé=i                   fiftin           y

       come.PFV-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
       ‘Fifteen children came.’Younger speakers also use a digit-based system in which numbers with more
than one digit are broken down and each digit is rendered in the traditional
                                                             3.10. Quantifiers     147counting system with a short pause between the digits, e.g. elekiêm blim ‘ten’
(one nothing), elekiêm asúke asúke make ‘fifteen’ (one five), or asúke asúke
blim ‘forty’ (four nothing).
   Instead of a numeral denoting an exact figure, the quantifier slot in the
noun phrase can be filled by homòn ‘many’, with which speakers do not
commit to a certain number:(167) tíl=i         milil=i              sm=i          homòn=i
      dog=PL.AN     black=PL.AN          big=PL.AN      many=PL.AN
      ‘many big black dogs’Contrary to Healey’s (1964a) claim, Mian indeed has a body-tally system
based on the number 27, as it is typical for the other Mountain Ok languages.
Healey writes:   All of the Ok languages except Minamin [sic!] and Wagarabai [i.e. the west
   Mian dialect – SF] appear to use the round-the-body method of counting.
   When counting, a person points successively to various parts of the body, and
   the numerals mostly consist of some recognizable form of the body-part
   names. One circuit of the body is a counting unit. Large numbers are
   specified as so many units (circuits) plus such-and-such a number (body-
   part). (Healey 1964a: 65)Counting in the Mian tally system commences with the left thumb, followed
by the fingers of the left hand, then up the left side of the body (wrist, forearm,
elbow, shoulder joint, shoulder, cheek, ear, eye, nose) each time adding one,
so that one reaches 14 when touching the nose. From there, counting proceeds
down the right side of the body (the pointing is done with the other hand now)
till the whole procedure ends with the thumb of the right hand and the number
27. Smith and Weston (1974b: 50-52) report that speakers become
increasingly vague while counting down the right-hand side of the body and
30 years later my own experience shows that speakers have trouble counting
within this traditional system once they have done the left hand and started
moving up the left arm.
     The reason why the Mian system escaped Healey’s attention probably lies
in the fact that body-part numerals cannot be used as numerals in noun
phrases, which they can in Telefol. This might be because the Mian body-tally
system was never used as a general counting device, as for example in Telefol
(Healey 1964a, Healey 1965a), but rather was highly restricted to counting in
connection with specific cultural practices, for example keeping track of the
months that had to pass until a new taro garden would have to be cleared and
planted. Nowadays, the body-part counting system is basically defunct. In
table 3.17 I give all the forms I was able to record.

9.5.      DitransitivesThe verb -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is an underived ditransitive. It belongs to the class
of verbs which obligatorily cross-reference and classify the theme object, i.e.
the gift, with a classificatory prefix (see 9.2.1). In addition, it also takes an
object suffix that cross-references the recipient argument (plus another suffix
for the subject). Thus, -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is an examples of triple agreement,
i.e. the indexing of subject and two objects (theme and recipient) by affixes on
the verb (Fedden 2010). Triple agreement is a typologically rare phenomenon,
both in Papuan languages and world-wide (Foley 2000). An example of -ûb’-
‘give (PFV)’ is given in (55):
352    9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause(55)   n       naka=e           éil=o
       1SG      man=SG.M         pig=SG.F       om-ûb’-a-Ø-i-bio=be
       3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=DECL
       ‘I gave the sow to the man.’For details on the derived nature of the imperfective counterpart -ka- ‘give
(IPFV)’, the reader is referred to 9.6.2.2.
    The ditransitive verb -fu- ‘send to (PFV-only)’1 involves compounding with
-ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ in order to introduce the recipient argument. It indexes the
theme with a classificatory prefix. The recipient argument is marked by a
suffix on the ‘give’-morpheme compounded with the main verb. Consider
example (56):(56)              baa-n-o=a                            futâan=o
       3SG.F       say.PFV-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED            letter=N2       om-fu-ˆb’-a-n-amab-i=bo

       say.PFV      say.PFV-REAL-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
       ‘She said she would send a letter to him.’ (lit. ‘She said: “I will
       send a letter to him.” ’)Although the recipient role of -fu- ‘send to (PFV)’ is obligatorily introduced
through serialization with ‘give’, which suggests derivation from a simpler
transitive base, such a transitive base does not exist: *-fu ‘send (PFV)’. Hence,
an utterance like (57) is ungrammatical regardless of whether the recipient is
expressed with a free noun phrase (in this case the pronoun n ‘me’):(57)   *futaan=o      (n)    om-fu-n-e=be
       letter=N2     (1SG) 3SG.F_CL.O-send.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       Intended: ‘He sent (me) a letter.’The same applies to ale- ‘show’, which lacks a transitive base *ale. As for -fu-
‘send to (PFV)’, the recipient argument, or in the case of ‘show’ the recipient-
like argument, is introduced by ‘give’ in the perfective. The theme participant,
i.e. the ‘shown’, is never cross-referenced on the verb by a pronominal affix
but can be encoded as a free noun phrase, as in (58):
                                                   9.6. Derived ditransitives   353(58)     kasak=e
         kasak_ritual=SG.N1         ale-ˆb’-e-Ø-ib-bio=ta
         show-give.PFV-PL.AN.R-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ-GPST=MED
         ‘they had shown us the Kasak (ritual), and then someone else...’
         [Kasak ritual]In natural Mian discourse overt noun phrase arguments are typically elided if
their identity is retrievable from the context even if the argument is not
indexed on the verb. Parallel to the case of elided object noun phrases in
transitive verbs, which were discussed in section 9.2.4 above, I have no
evidence suggesting that the verb ale- ‘show’ becomes monotransitive, i.e.
only has a subject and a recipient object (indexed with a suffix), when the
overt object noun phrase (referring to the entity shown) is elided. Therefore, I
analyse ale- ‘show’ as an underived ditransitive verb whose object noun
phrase can be freely elided without assuming a change in argument structure.
    To sum up, the clearest example of an underived ditransitive verb in Mian
is -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’. It encodes the theme with a set of prefixes and the
recipient and the subject with two different sets of suffixes. In the case of -fu-
‘send to (PFV)’, we are dealing with a lexicalization, which is underived (at
least in contemporary Mian). A similar argument can be made for ale- ‘show
to (PFV)’.","[377, 378, 379]"

Acknowledgements
The present volume is the heavily revised version of my doctoral dissertation
“A grammar of Mian, a Papuan language of New Guinea”. It is wider in scope
and also tries to get rid of the rough edges of the dissertation. Since my days
as a Ph.D. student I have been back to the field for two more months
expanding the corpus and tying up loose ends in the analysis. This larger
corpus, the critical and helpful comments of the external reviewers, as well as
two years of turning over various issues of Mian grammar in my mind, helped
me to develop a clearer view of many of these issues. I would like to sincerely
thank the following people and institutions for providing help and support
during my Ph.D. and while revising the material and preparing it for
publication. All mistakes are, of course, my own.
    A great debt of gratitude is owed to the people of the Mianmin
communities in Mianmin and Yapsiei for sharing their language, culture and
lives with me during my stay in Papua New Guinea. In particular, thanks to
the whole Milimab family, especially to Kasening Milimab, for great patience
and interest in this project and for taking me in as one of the family.
    Special thanks go to my language consultants: Kasening Milimab, who had
an immense knowledge and was very concerned that I learn Mian properly,
Asuneng Amit, who had the gift of telling wonderful stories and the patience
for paradigm elicitation, Liden Milimab, whose superb command of English
was helpful in many ways, and Raymond Davai, who taught me basic Mian
tonology by indicating pitch movements with hand gestures, after it had turned
out that the method of having speakers whistle the tones failed. Thanks also to
Beitab Fenobi and Ibalim Soubgena, from whom I was able to record
historical accounts and descriptions of traditional Mianmin initiation rituals
and to Umsin Milimab, Wentak Yung, Awaseb Oblib, Ms. Selem Kasening,
Milsen (aka Mandat) Milimab, Eron Yung, Davai Milimab, Wils Tloniab,
Stanley Ebtem, Headmaster Nontlin Dab, Ray Waniab from MAF in Tabubil,
Jeremiah (aka Vagi) Yung, Ebel Yangsin, Aiben, and the pastors Uneyab and
Maikas.
    I am grateful to my supervisors Nick Evans and Rachel Nordlinger for
steady guidance and support throughout the Ph.D. project.
    Thanks to Nick for always challenging me intellectually in our supervision
meetings, for never being satisfied with the second best, but also for steady
encouragement along the way. He not only made me be critical towards my
work and sharpen my analyses of Mian linguistic structure but also made me
aware how important it is to have the reader in mind when writing a grammar.
vi   AcknowledgementsThanks also for many valuable tips concerning fieldwork and equipment
(especially the ‘dead-dog’ bag to keep things dry).
    Thanks to Rachel, who was always there for spontaneous meetings, in
which we discussed various topics of my thesis and brought some sense into
the complex Mian verb morphology. Also for being a great moral support
throughout the time of my Ph.D.
    I thank the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen for
enabling me to continue my work on this grammar while being a postdoc in
the Language and Cognition Group, and the Arts and Humanities Research
Council (UK) for giving me the opportunity to continue my work and finish
this grammar while working on the ESF EuroBabel project “Alor-Pantar
languages: origin and theoretical impact” (AH/H500251/1).
    The fieldwork I have conducted during my time as a Ph.D. student (in 2004
and 2005) was funded by the Arts Faculty of the University of Melbourne and
the ARC Discovery Project “Reciprocals across languages”. The last field trip
(in 2008) was funded by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in
Nijmegen. I thank these bodies for their financial support.
    I wrote the revised version of my thesis presented in this volume as a
postdoctoral fellow at the MPI for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen and in the
Surrey Morphology Group at the University of Surrey. I thank Steve Levinson
and Grev Corbett, respectively, for their help and support.
    Special thanks go to Don Gardner who first got me interested in working
on Mian. Don has been working as an anthropologist with the West Mianmin
for the last 30 years and I was lucky to be able to profit from his knowledge
and connections in Papua New Guinea. Don accompanied me on my first trip
for a couple of weeks, introduced me to the people and was generally an
invaluable help for me to adjust to the unfamiliar environment.
    The first one and a half months of my first field trip I spent in Yapsiei
station. I would like to thank Tesinab Balabe, with whom I worked there, and
Atupe, Father Ben and Father Albino of the Yapsiei mission station, Milan
Janda, who was researching moths in the area and who let me use his satellite
phone, and the kiap of Telefomin District Ricky Yentop Yaman.
    Further, I thank the National Research Institute of Papua New Guinea in
Port Moresby, especially Jim Robins, and the Provincial Government of
Sandaun Province in Vanimo, especially Eugene Raire and Ignatius Litiki.
    I thank Bernard Comrie and Bill Foley, the examiners of my dissertation,
for many critical comments and helpful suggestions which I incorporated into
the present book.
    Matthew Dryer, the cognizant editor for the Mouton Grammar Library,
closely read the whole manuscript. I am very grateful for his insightful
comments which made me change many aspects of the description and the
analysis and which thus greatly improved the quality of the grammar.

The language and its speakers
1.0.     IntroductionThe term Mian is not a native Mian word. Nevertheless, it is nowadays used as
an ethnonym and a logonym and as a toponym for the airstrip near the
Mianmin settlements Timeilmin and Temsakmin. Traditionally, the Mianmin
had no term for their people but used group or clan names which were
compounded with the nominal stem tn ‘people’, e.g. Usalei-tn and Kmeil-
tn, denoting the Mian clans who today live in the settlements Gubil and
Timeilmin, respectively.
    The noun mian means ‘dog’ in the related Ok languages Faiwol and Bimin
(Healey 1964a: 85) and in the distantly related Oksapmin language (Lawrence
1972a, Lawrence 1972b, Loughnane 2009). The story goes that when a patrol
came to Telefomin District in the mid 1930s and asked for information about
the people living towards the north and west of the Telefomin area, who
afterwards became known as the Mianmin, they learned the name ‘Mian’,
possibly because the Mianmin had a reputation as fierce warriors. This name
subsequently became the standard designation for the people under the
colonial administration and later was adopted by the Mianmin people
themselves. The Oksapmin know a mythical story of how the Mianmin got
their name. Near Oksapmin station there is a rock face amidst the rain forest
covering the steep wall of a mountain ridge. According to Oksapmin myth,
that was the place where a bitch gave birth to the first Mianmin in days of
yore. From there, they moved westward into lower altitude regions, into the
traditional and contemporary Mianmin area.1
    Linguists of the Summer Institute of Linguistics generally used the terms
‘Mianmin’ or ‘Oksapmin’ both as ethnonyms and language names. This
terminology gained wider currency through the classic literature on Papuan
languages (Wurm 1982, Foley 1986). Originally, the Mianmin called their
language wéng, which polysemously means ‘sound, voice, speech, language’.
Nowadays, they use Mian wéng ‘Mian language’. Most names of inhabited
places are compounds ending in am ‘house’, such as Mian-am ‘Mianmin’,
Temsel-am ‘Temsakmin’, Klefol-am ‘Telefomin’, Oksab-am ‘Oksapmin’ or in
bib ‘village, hamlet, place’, e.g. Kondu-bib, Skio-bib. I will use the term
‘Mian’ for the language (as an abbreviation of Mian wéng) and ‘Mianmin’ as
the ethnonym and as the toponym signifying the area around Mianmin airstrip.
2      1. The language and its speakers1.1.        Mian wéng: The Mian languageMian (also known as ‘Mianmin’ or ‘Miyanmin’ in the literature, ISO mpt) is a
Papuan language of the Ok family. The term ‘Papuan’ is not to be understood
as a name for a well-defined language family but as a residue category for the
non-Austronesian and non-Australian languages of the south-west Pacific
(Foley 1986, 2000).
   The Ok family of languages belongs to the larger Trans New Guinea
(TNG) family, and is of roughly the same order of internal diversification as
Germanic within Indo-European (Healey 1964a, Wurm 1982, Pawley 2005).
The Ok languages are named after the widespread cognate ok ‘river, water’ in
these languages.2 Mian is spoken by fewer than two thousand people in the
north-west of Telefomin District in Sandaun Province, Papua New Guinea.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"
"
6.3.5.    QuantifiersThe class of quantifiers comprises numerals and the quantifying expressions
homòn ‘many’, alukûm ‘all, every, each’, and alik ‘all, every, each’. Numerals
usually appear without an article. In Mian, pronouns from the ‘alone’-series
elekiêm (also eleyêm) ‘he/it alone’ and olokiêm (also oloyêm) ‘she/it alone’
double as the numeral ‘one’:(28)     naka=e      elekiêm
         man=SG.M    one.M
         ‘one man’ OR ‘the man alone’(29)     unáng=o      olokiêm
         woman=SG.F one.F
         ‘one woman’ OR ‘the woman alone’The only two basic numerals Mian has are asú ‘two’ and asumâtna ‘three’.
The former has a variant asusûna, which looks like a partial reduplication of
the simple numeral asú ’two’. Nonetheless, asusûna means ‘two’, not ‘four’:
212    6. The noun phrase(30)   unáng=i              asú(=ei)/asusûna(=i)
       woman=PL.AN          two(=PL.AN)
       ‘two women’Numerals larger than three are phrasal and involve stringing together instances
of asú=ke ‘two=and’ (i.e. the numeral asú ‘two’ and the function verb stem ke
‘do’ serving as a coordinator in phrasal numerals) as many times as needed to
count to any even number and rounding this off by make ‘(one) other’ for odd
numbers. Phrasal numerals occur with the verbal element na ‘do’, if they carry
an article:(31)   unáng=i           asú=ke asú=ke
       woman=PL.AN two=do two=do
       ‘four women’ (lit. ‘two and two women’)(32)   memé         asú=ke asú=ke make             na=i
       children     two=do two=do other            do=PL.AN
       ‘five children’ (lit. ‘two and two children and another’)Numerals always occur after adjectival modifiers:(33)   memé          gwáab=i         asumâtna
       children      little=PL.AN    three
       ‘three little children’Instead of a numeral denoting an exact figure, the quantifier slot in the noun
phrase can be filled by homòn ‘many’:(34)   tíl=i         milil=i             sm=i         homòn=i
       dog=PL.AN black=PL.AN             big=PL.AN     many=PL.AN
       ‘many big black dogs’The quantifier alukûm ‘all, every, each’ usually follows the whole noun phrase
but can also precede it. The quantifier alik ‘all, every, each’ is only attested
following the noun phrase. The exact semantic difference between the two is
unclear.
    Neither alukûm nor alik can take an article or any other determiner:(35)   Mianam=o     naka=i          alukûm/alik        am-sa=be
       PN=N2        man=PL.AN       all/all            house-with=DECL
       ‘The men of Mianmin all have a house.’
                                                  6.3. Modified noun phrases   213Alukûm and alik can be employed to express that some event affected an
inanimate object in its entirety:(36)     afonón         =sa           alukûm
         shin_bone      PL.N1=too      all         kib-a-Ø-o=be
         ash-VBLZ-REAL-3N1.PL.SBJ=DECL
         ‘The shinbones too became all ashes.’ (lit. ‘all “ashified” ’) [Crows]The quantifier alukûm can precede the whole noun phrase:(37)     alukûm      asyam=o          klaan-Ø-o=be
         all         fruit=PL.N1      rot.PFV-REAL-3PL.N1.SBJ=DECL
         ‘All fruits have rotted.’
6.3.6.     The intensifiers dót ‘very’, wekîb ‘very’, and klâ ‘really’The intensifiers dót ‘very’, wekîb ‘very’, and klâ ‘really’ can be used to
modify attributive adjectives or the quantifier homòn ‘many’. Intensifiers
always precede the adjective or the quantifier:(38)     tíl     milil      dót      sm=e
         dog     black      very     big=SG.M
         ‘a very big, black dog’(39)     tíl      klâ       milil     sm=e
         dog      really    black     big=SG.M
         ‘a big, really black dog’(40)     dót   homòn=o=be
         very many=PRD=DECL
         ‘(There are) Very many.’Only one modifier can be intensified per noun phrase, that is if there are two
modifiers, either of them but not both may be modified by an intensifier. It is
however possible to have two intensifiers in front of a modifier:(41)     kofi          dót klâ         kok=e
         coffee(TP) very really        sour=SG.N1
         ‘some really very sour coffee’
214      6. The noun phrase6.3.7.     Demonstratives in the noun phraseDemonstratives go in the determiner slot at the right edge of the noun phrase.
This is illustrated for a simple demonstrative in (42) and (43), and for an
emphatic demonstrative in (44):(42)     naka     asumâtna    li
         man      three       DEM.PROX.PL.AN
         ‘these three men’(43)     sob=e           sm eka tekebmín       le
         soap=SG.N1 big and long                DEM.PROX.SG.N1

         DEM.PL.AN-EMPH
         ‘these five women of Sokamin’The distal demonstrative series formally distinguishes between an adnominal
and a pronominal series. The former always involves the clitic element obba,
which is followed by the distal demonstrative.(45)     ninín=obba            y
         name(N2)=ADNOM        DEM.DIST.N2         o-biaan-ib=a

         ‘those brothers over there’On the use of the adnominal distal series of demonstratives in head-internal
relative clauses, see 13.3.5.
                                                 6.3. Modified noun phrases   2156.3.8.     Relative clausesAll Mian relative clauses are finite and can be either prenominal or head-
internal. Both types of relative clause will be described in detail in section
13.3 under embedding.
    Prenominal relative clauses precede their head noun. They do not receive
any marking indicating subordination. An example of a prenominal relative
clause is given in (47):(47)     balubib=y        mâa’-bl-Ø-ib
         airstrip=at       stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ         naka=i
         man=PL.AN
         ‘the men who are standing at the airstrip.’Head-internal relative clauses are obligatorily marked with a proper subset of
determiners, all of which are also used to mark non-relativized noun phrases.
They function as noun phrases occupying the argument position which the
head noun has in the main clause, for example the object in (48):(48)     naka=i         balubib     y
         man=PL.AN      airstrip    at         mâa’-bl-Ø-ib=i
         stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=PL.AN         ya-temê’-b-i=be
         PL.AN.O-see.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
         ‘I am looking at the men who are standing at the airstrip.’In head-internal relative clauses, the head noun can be omitted. The
restrictions concerning omission of the head noun are examined in more detail
in section 13.3.3. An example is:(49)     balubib y mâa’-bl-Ø-ib=i
         airstrip at stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=PL.AN
         ‘the (ones) who are standing at the airstrip’In each of the examples above, the subject is relativized. Objects, possessors
and – at least in prenominal relative clauses – locatives can also be relativized.
216    6. The noun phrase    Constituent order in relative clauses is no different from the order in
independent clauses, with one noteworthy exception where the internal head
of a relative clause shows some mobility unattested in simple declarative
sentences (see 13.3.7). Verbs in relative clauses show all inflectional
possibilities of a (sentence-final) verb in an independent sentence in terms of
tense, aspect, mood, and argument marking. For example, they can be
inflected for irrealis or deontic mood, which medial verbs cannot.
    Head-internal relative clauses are much more frequent than prenominal
ones in natural discourse. Nearly all examples of prenominal relative clauses
are elicited. However, in most cases the prenominal variant of a head-internal
relative clause was offered immediately by the speaker without any further
question as to whether a prenominal relative construction was also possible.","[237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"
"
13.3.5.     Other markers of head-internal relative clausesSo far the discussion has been confined to articles as markers of head-internal
relative clauses. But like non-relativized noun phrases, head-internal relative
clauses can take a whole range of pronominal elements, such as:-     Distal demonstrative: y/y/yi
-     Proximal demonstrative: le/lo/li
-     Emphatic pronoun: ta/ta/ta
-     Emphatic proximal demonstrative: leta/lota/lita
-     Emphatic distal demonstrative: yta/yta/yitaOn emphatic pronouns, see 3.7.4. On demonstratives, see 3.7.9.
  Instead of an article, the distal demonstratives y/y/yi can be used to
mark a head-internal relative clause:(62)      tubáan=a                blon        áan=o            bubbub=a
          chest_feather=and       wing_bone    feather=PL.N1    down=and          y       bi-Ø-o=yo

          ‘(both) the chest feathers and the downs of the wing feathers which
          were there’ [Crows]An example of the animate plural form of the distal demonstrative yi is given
in (63):(63)      naka=obba       y        aaie
          man=ADNOM       there     water          fua-b-ib=yei

the emphatic pronoun (65), and the emphatic distal demonstrative (66) as

13.3.6.    Complex head-internal relative clauses and switch referenceHead-internal relative clauses themselves can be complex insofar as they can
be a clause chaining construction consisting of at least one medial clause and
one final clause. Although there should be no theoretical limit to the number
510    13. Embeddingof medial clauses, complex head-internal relatives maximally consist of one
medial and one final clause in my corpus. The rarity of chained relative
clauses in general and of long ones (those which have more than one medial
clause) in particular is probably attributable to processing constraints.
Likewise, it is no wonder that complex prenominal relative clauses are not
attested at all. Processing issues due to the length of relative clauses are more
pronounced here because the hearer has to process the whole relative clause
before being able to identify the head noun, which follows the prenominal
relative clause.
    In complex chained head-internal relative clauses, the medial clause has a
medial verb and the verb in the last clause is final. In this respect, chained
relative clauses are no different from clause-chaining constructions in general.
However, unlike independent sentences which consist of a clause chain, the
final verb in a chained relative clause does not take an illocutionary clitic but
rather a determiner which marks the whole relative clause as a noun phrase:(68)   Afueiwok=o       Dimobib=wt      daa-n-o=a
       PN=SG.F          PN=across        dwell.PFV-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED       te-s-u=o

       ‘Afueiwok, who dwelled across in Dimobib and came (a long time
       ago)’ [Afueiwok]In terms of marking S/R and event sequentiality or simultaneity, medial verbs
in chained relative clauses behave exactly like medial verbs in non-embedded
clause chains. S/R morphology provides a nifty mechanism to anticipate a
change of the grammatical relation the head noun has with respect to the verb
in the succeeding clause. Consider example (69):(69)   nakamín=e       tosiana

13.3.7.     An analytical issue in head-internal relative clausesSo far I have been assuming without justification that head-internal relatives
are clauses. It is now time to justify this assumption. Consider (70):(70)      naka=i         balubib=y
          man=PL.AN      airstrip=at          mâa’-bl-Ø-ib
          stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ          li
          DEM.PROX.PL.AN
          ‘these men who are standing at the airstrip’Now, it is not necessarily straightforward that an expression, such as in (70),
should be analysed as one clause with an overt subject noun phrase naka=i as
opposed to another theoretically possible analysis which breaks this
expression down into a nominal head nakai and an embedded postnominal
relative clause balubib y mâa’blib li.
    There is prosodic and syntactic evidence that (70) is indeed a full clause
and not a head noun followed by a postnominal relative clause. Prosodically,
the whole string is one intonational unit, set off from the rest of the matrix
clause by a short pause. Hence, phonological evidence points towards an
analysis of head-internal relatives as single clauses.
    Syntactic evidence comes from the simple fact that any head-internal
relative clause can have the constituent order which one would expect if they
were independent declarative sentences. Consider the following two head-
internal relative clauses in (71) and (72):(71)      [naka=i] SBJ          y
          man=PL.AN             there          mâa’-bl-Ø-ib=i

       DEM.PROX.PL.AN
       ‘these two marsupials which the man is carrying on his arm’
       [Mammals and insects]Not only do head-internal relative clauses display regular clausal syntax, i.e.
SV in intransitive clauses (71) and AOV in transitive ones (72), but the latter
example shows especially well that the head noun, here being the object,
occurs in its normal position within the clause and that it is not the case that
the head noun is followed by a postnominal relative clause.
   Further evidence against an analysis which assumes postnominal relative
clauses comes from chained relative clauses with different overt subject noun
phrases. Consider (73):(73)   imak-wal        bl-Ø-ib=a                               nakamîn-wal
       husband-PL      stay.IPFV-DS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED       man-PL       bl-Ø-ib=i

       say.PFV-DS.SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
       ‘they (the Telefol women) told the(ir) husbands and brothers who
       were there (at home) and then the brothers and husbands…’
       [Mianmin and Telefomin]In the face of this example, it would be very difficult to argue that the
utterance imak-wal bliba nakamîn-wal blibi is anything but a chain of two
clauses each with its own overt subject noun phrase, where the first clause has
a medial verb (bliba) and the second a final verb (blib) with the article =i.
Although chained clauses with medial verbs are dependent on the final verb in
the last clause of the chain regarding certain morphosyntactic information,
clause chains are essentially coordinate and not subordinate or embedded
structures.
    There are, however, cases which prima facie conflict with the analysis that
head-internal relative clauses are single clauses rather than a head noun
                                                     13.3. Relative clauses   513followed by a postnominal relative clause. If the object is relativized and the
subject is overtly realized as a pronoun, the only attested word order is:(74)   naka=e       n      a-têm’-Ø-i=e
       man=SG.M     1SG 3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=SG.M
       ‘the man whom I saw’This case provides problematic evidence because the constituent order OAV,
which we find in (74) is not possible in independent sentences, if the subject is
a free (non-emphatic) pronoun. Compare (75) and (76):(75)   naka=e          n-ta          a-têm’-Ø-i=be
       man=SG.M        1SG-EMPH       3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I (i.e. not you) saw the man.’(76)   *nakae n atêm’ibe
       Intended: ‘I saw the man.’So we have to conclude that should we want to analyse (74) as a head-internal
relative clause, it would not conform to normal clausal syntax. There are two
ways out of this situation.
    First, one could assume embedding for this special case and say that in
(74) a nominal antecedent naka=e is followed by an embedded postnominal
relative clause n a-têm’-Ø-i=e. Clearly this is unsatisfactory because (a)
under such an analysis only examples like (74) would involve embedding
whereas for all other cases there is no evidence for a postnominal embedded
relative clause at all. Such a solution makes the analysis of head-internal
relatives unnecessarily complicated. After all, head-internal relative clauses,
whether they conform to basic constituent order in declarative sentences or
whether they are deviant in that respect, are formally marked in the same way.
    The second option is to assume that head-internal relative clauses are
single clauses, the corollary being that they can differ from simple declarative
sentences in that they are allowed to display a constituent order unattested in
simple declarative sentences.
    This is clearly the way to go in the analysis of Mian. In discussing head-
internal relatives (which he calls “zirkumnominal”, i.e. circum-nominal),
Lehmann (1984) proposes a distinction between a variant with a stationary
nucleus (i.e. unbewegter Nucleus) as opposed to a variant with a preposed
nucleus (i.e. vorangestellter Nucleus). On the issue of the head position in
head-internal relative clauses also see Basilico (1996). Languages which have
head-internal relative clauses can show both variants. Diegueño, for example,
usually has stationary nuclei but allows preposed ones as a secondary strategy
514   13. Embedding(Gorbet 1973). We find a similar situation in Mian. Stationary nuclei are the
norm but under special circumstances when an overt pronoun is involved and
the object is relativized, as in example (74) above, the preposed-nucleus
strategy is consistently chosen.

Texts
This is a collection of three texts. The first two are traditional narratives which
are about the origin of a certain fruit and a certain type of arrow, respectively.
The third text is procedural. In this text the narrator tells about how he is
rolling a smoke. All three texts follow that orthographic conventions
established in chapter 2.9. Each sentence or clause in a clause chain has a
separate number.","[534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541]"

3.2.     VerbsAs verbs are morphologically by far the most complex word class in Mian, I
will only be concerned with the defining features at this point and only give a
few examples to illustrate the most fundamental points about verb inflection in
Mian. For a detailed treatment of the morphology of the verb the reader is
referred to chapter 8.
    Loans from Tok Pisin or English cannot be inflected like native Mian
verbs, but rather such loans have to be followed by the function verb ke ‘do’ in
a function verb construction:(36)             futbol        pilai        ke-b-io=be
       3PL.AN     football(TP) play(TP)      do-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
       ‘They are playing football.’Mian has intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, ambitransitive, and impersonal
(atransitive) verbs. Transitives can be productively derived from intransitives
and ditransitives from transitives. On basic argument structures and derived
ones, see sections 9.1 to 9.7.
    Semantically, verbs refer to actions, processes, and states. Verbs fulfil the
function of the predicate of a clause.
    Suprasegmentally, verbs are either unaccented, in which case they are all-
low, or are lexically specified for an accent to which one of two complex tonal
melodies (either HL or LHL) is assigned. Nouns, on the other hand, are
associated with one of five tonal melodies.
    Syntactically, verbs are easily identified. Mian is an SOV language.
Although there is some pragmatically motivated variability with respect to the
position of subject and object, the last word in a clause is almost always the
verb and under no circumstances can the verb be followed by any of its
arguments. Occasionally, however, one finds locative adjuncts postposed after
the verb which are adverbial modifiers of the preceding verb syntactically, but
which form their own intonational unit (see 11.2.10).
    Morphologically, verbs can index their core arguments with pronominal
affixes cross-referencing subject (37) and object (38):
102    3. Word classes and grammatical relations(37)    lo     y      fu-m-i=be
       now    there smoke.IPFV.INCH-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘Now I start smoking.’ [Rolling smokes](38)   ya-temê’-b-e=a
       PL.AN.O-look_at.IPFV-DS.SIM-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘while he was watching them, (they …)’ [Danenok]For more information on the indexation of arguments on the verb, see the
sections 3.14 on grammatical relations, 8.5 on argument marking, and 9.2 on
transitive verbs.
   Final verbs, i.e. verbs in independent sentences or in final clauses of clause
chains, can be inflected for various aspectual categories, e.g. -b ‘Imperfective’
(39), modal categories, e.g. -n ‘Realis’ (40), and temporal categories, e.g. -s
‘Remote past’ (41):(39)   sm     y         gen-b-i=be

       ‘Well, did they kill the pig?’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]Medial verbs, i.e. verbs in non-final clauses in clause chains, can be inflected
for co- or disjoint reference of the subject in the succeeding clause in
combination with sequentiality or simultaneity of events. In (42), the suffix -b
‘DS.SIM’ indicates that the event described in the first clause is on-going
when the event described by the second clause takes place and that this second
clause has a different subject:(42)   gwáab=i          -maye                 dowôn’

       ‘the small (ones) themselves ate and (then) were going away, when
       a wild boar came’ [Afoksitgabáam]A subset of verbs, almost all of which make predications of handling or
movement, has an obligatory classificatory prefix which classifies one of the
arguments according to semantic characteristics, namely sex, form, and
function, on an absolutive basis. In (43), the object fukêt ‘smoking gourd’ is
classified as belonging to the residue class.(43)                     dab=o
       3PL.AN.POSS        same_sex_siblings(dyad)=COLL       fukêt=e

       3SG.RESID.O-take.PFV-SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
       ‘the brothers took a smoking gourd’ [Danenok]About half of the verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with a
perfective/imperfective contrast. The rest are trans-aspectual, i.e. they have
only one stem which is vague with respect to aspect. A few verbs are defective
and lack either a perfective or an imperfective stem. Formally distinct
perfective and imperfective stems are subject to certain inflectional
restrictions, e.g. a perfective stem cannot be directly inflected for imperfective
aspect but has to enter an auxiliary construction. Trans-aspectual stems are not
restricted in terms of their inflectional morphology.
   For certain tense-aspect combinations, some verbs cannot be inflected
directly, but have to be serialized with the existential verb functioning as an
auxiliary before inflection can proceed:(44)   fu      unan-biaana-b-io=be
       cook    eat.IPFV-AUX.HAB.PST-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
       ‘They used to cook and eat (some kind of fruit) until now.’Two verb stems can be compounded into one phonological and grammatical
verbal word which forms a single predication denoting a single event. Verbs
also frequently appear in serial verb constructions in which only the last verb
is fully inflected and all preceding verbs are either bare verb stems or stems
with affixes indexing any object(s) but lack TAM inflection or marking for
104    3. Word classes and grammatical relationssubject, polarity or illocutionary force. Mian allows verb serialization at the
core or the nuclear level. See 11.1 for a detailed description of verb
serialization.
    Directionals can be directly inflected to form intransitive verbs of motion,
for example from daak ‘down’:(45)   daak-n-i=a
       down-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
       ‘I go down and then I…’.","[127, 128, 129, 130]"

10.3.       Topic-only questionsTopic-only questions are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is given,
as in English What about John? or And you? The speaker has a particular
question in mind, and it must be obvious from the context what the implied
question is, normally something that would have been asked immediately
before about a different discourse participant or something that was
anticipated by a statement, such as I’m going. What about you? (Implied: Are
you going as well?). In Mian topic-only questions are formed by using a free
pronoun or noun phrase and the low-toned topic clitic =le. In the examples
below, possible implied questions are given in brackets. If context is lacking
the default interpretation of a topic-only question would be about the topic’s
whereabouts:(58)      bo=le?
          2SG.F=TOP
          ‘What about you?’ (Possible implication: ‘What are you doing?’,
          ‘What do you want to eat?’)
                                               10.3. Topic-only questions   403(59)   Leoni    =le?
       PN       3SG.F=TOP
       ‘What about Leoni?’ (Possible implication: ‘What’s Leoni doing?’,
       ‘Where is Leoni?’)Topic-only questions are a special case because they do not display any of the
usual strategies to mark an utterance as a question in Mian. As can be seen
from the two examples above, there are no interrogative words nor do any
interrogative particles occur.
    I assume that there are two reasons why (58) and (59) are readily
interpreted as topic-only questions though they do not bear any of the markers
typical of questions in Mian: (a) they have their own distinctive intonational
contour, namely a level high pitch on the topic marker =le which is almost as
high as the H on the preceding vowel and (b) as a matter of convention, any
utterance of the structure NP=TOP is interpreted as a topic-only question.
Chapter 11
Chaining constructions
11.0.    IntroductionThis chapter deals with two different types of chaining construction, both of
which are highly frequent in Mian discourse. The first type is verb
serialization where two or more verb stems are concatenated to form a
sequence of predicates within a single clause. Within serial verb constructions,
I distinguish between core and nuclear (or ‘tight’) serializations. The second
type of chaining construction is clause chaining where two or more clauses are
chained together to form a sentence.
   These two construction types have in common that they are essentially
coordinate (i.e. not subordinate or embedded) structures and that their last
constituent carries grammatical information, such as illocutionary force and
polarity, which has scope over the entire construction. This form of
dependency relation in serial verb constructions and clause chains is also
called co-subordination in the literature (Reesink 1983, Foley and Van Valin
1984). A succinct definition of co-subordination can be found in Reesink
(1983: 224-226): “[Co-subordination] refers to a process whereby two items
are coordinated into a new whole with operators applying to this new whole
rather than to one of the conjuncts.” The scope rules of operators in clause
chains will be taken up in detail in chapter 12.","[428, 429, 430, 431]"

 Neuter 2                         =o                     am ‘house’The animate plural article =i is realized as =ei if it cliticizes to a word ending
in a high vowel /i/ or /u/. The following examples may suffice: /Hsnabi/
‘crocodile’ and /Hsnabi=i/ ‘(the) crocodiles’; /Lumasou/ ‘fish species’ and
/umasou=i/ ‘(the) umasou fish’, but /naka=i/ ‘(the) men’ not */naka=i/.
   Consider example (60) where three nouns – each with a pronominal article
– appear as subject, object, and possessor:(60)     nakamîn=e          imen=o         éil=e
         man=SG.M           taro=PL.N1     pig=SG.M         wen-ha-b-e=a

         ‘While a pig was eating a man’s taro, the man…’ [Pig story]The formatives under discussion are articles rather than overt number/gender
markers because they also indicate referentiality. The noun without the article
occurs in contexts in which the noun is used non-referentially, that is in any of
the following contexts:-     in the citation form, e.g. nakamîn ‘man, brother’, éil ‘pig’, imen ‘taro’,
      sók ‘rain’, kukub ‘way, custom’.
-     in generic object arguments in the citation form of (some) transitive
      verbs, e.g. as hakalin [wood break.IPFV.VN] ‘(activity of) breaking
      wood’
-     in first elements in N-N compounds, e.g. wan-am [bird-house] ‘bird
      blind’
-     in generic terms used to classify animals and plants, e.g. wan ‘bird’ in
      wan tolim [bird eagle] ‘New Guinea eagle (sc. Harpyopsis
      novaeguineae)’
                                                               3.3. Articles   111-   in non-verbal predications about identity, e.g. tíl=o=be

-   under negation, e.g. imen bl-im [taro exist-NEG] ‘there’s no taro’,
    yi=ba=be [wound=NEG=DECL] ‘it’s not a wound’This suggests that the article does not behave like overt gender or noun class
markers in many Australian or Bantu languages, in which a noun either
invariably has a certain marker or invariably lacks it, but rather functions as an
article marking the noun as definite-referential or indefinite-referential but is
left out if the noun is used non-referentially. However, there is a tendency to
leave out the article if the noun is inanimate even if it is used referentially.
    Mian does not mark its nouns overtly for gender but rather requires the
article to agree in gender with its noun. There is evidence that the article is on
the way of becoming a purely classificatory gender marker through the
extension of the form with article to non-referential contexts. Although the
form without article is the preferred choice under negation, as in
as bl-im [wood exist-NEG] ‘there’s no wood’, one also finds as=e bl-im
[wood=ARTICLE exist-NEG] with the same meaning. Greenberg (1978) shows
that across languages the definite article often winds up as a gender marker on
the noun after going through a grammaticalization process during which it is
increasingly used both as a definite article, meaning ‘the N’, and an indefinite
specific article, meaning ‘a specific N’ or ‘a certain N’. When the use of the
article becomes a function of the syntactic construction in which the noun
appears (e.g. negation), the original contrast between the form with article and
the form without article is lost and the distinction becomes redundant. At this
point the form with article usually starts to spread to all contexts. If this form
becomes universal in the language, the former article has become a gender
marker on the noun (Greenberg 1978: 63).
    Articles can follow all nouns, i.e. common nouns, proper names, dyads,
and temporal and verbal nouns (see section 3.1). Articles can also follow finite
verbs in head-internal relative clauses and adverbial clauses. In head-internal
relative clauses (61), the article agrees in number and gender with the noun. In
adverbials (62), the article is invariably =o. Square brackets indicate clause
boundaries:(61)   [no=i                    ya-l-êb
       marsupial=PL.AN          PL.AN.O-kill.PFV-take.PFV       tl-Ø-e=i]

       ‘when the people grew up, they assumed names and then…’
       [Dimosson]Adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses are discussed in 13.2 and
13.3 under embedding.
   Articles can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and follow the noun
and any adjectival modifiers. They can also follow numerals (see 6.3 for
details on modified and quantified noun phrases):(63)   tíl=e           milil=e          sm=e
       dog=SG.M        black=SG.M       big=SG.M
       ‘a/the big, black dog’In (63), referentiality, number and gender are marked per article =e on the
noun and on each adjectival modifier. More common in natural discourse,
however, is to have only one article for the whole noun phrase, namely
following the rightmost modifier, for example:(64)   tíl     milil     sm=e
       dog black         big=SG.M
       ‘a/the big, black dog’I analyse the article as a clitic rather than a suffix for the following reasons:
(a) Apart from nouns, articles can attach to adjectives and numerals and also
to verbs in adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses. (b) The
coordinating clitic =a (presumably a shortened form of eka ‘and’) usually
intervenes between the noun and the article in the last constituent of a
sequence of coordinate noun phrases:(65)   naka=i=a           unáng=a=i
       man=PL.AN=and      woman=and=PL.AN
       ‘(the) men and women’ [Dimosson]Articles are segmentally identical to the third person forms of the free
pronouns series, from which they are probably derived. Synchronically,
however, they differ from the pronouns in their suprasegmentals. While all
free pronoun forms are lexically specified for a high tone, articles are subject
                                                                3.3. Articles   113to suprasegmental phonological erosion, i.e. they are on the way to becoming
toneless. As lexical tone spreads to any toneless affixes and clitics, the
phonetic pitch value of the article depends on the lexical tone specification of
the noun (see 2.8.3.2).
    I assume three stages in this grammaticalization scenario. Contemporary
Mian is moving from stage (b) to stage (c):(66)     (a) naka  (lit. ‘man he’) > (b) naka= > (c) naka-e ‘a/the man’In the first stage (a), nouns were followed by a free pronoun which was
realized as a phonologically independent word. Synchronically, articles are
generally not realized as independent phonological words anymore, although
this still happens occasionally in very old speakers (over 80 years).
    In the second stage (b), the article encliticizes to the noun. Concomitantly,
suprasegmental attrition sets in.
    At the final stage (c), the vocalic formative will have developed into a
toneless nominal suffix.
    As the article is part of the phonological nominal word (even in very
careful speech), it is clear that the language has moved beyond the first stage.
However, one finds the pronunciations [na.ka. ] and [na.ka.] ‘a/the man’. In
the former, the article has its own high tone, in the latter it is toneless and low
tone is spread from the noun to the article. Articles which retain their own
high tone (characteristic of the second stage) and ones which are toneless
(characteristic of the third stage) occur in free variation.","[136, 137, 138, 139]"

4.7.     EvaluationAn analysis of the Mian gender system as a two-class system makes sense of
the striking patterns of homophony in the agreement markers by treating =e
and =o as exponents of the masculine and the feminine gender, respectively.
    Above, we have seen that an analysis of Mian gender in terms of masculine
and feminine gender entails that we have to accept that for animate referents
gender operates independently of number, whereas (at least) for inanimates
that allow a number opposition, a contrast in number or quantity is expressed
by means of a contrast in gender. In such a system a change in number results
in a change in gender and vice versa, conflating the categories number and
gender for these inanimate nouns.
    It is my view that such an analysis should be rejected in general and in
Mian in particular because despite the patterns of homophony, gender and
number are different phenomena and should therefore be kept separate in a
synchronic description of a language. Gender is a lexical feature of a noun.
Evidence for this assumption comes from the fact that assignment can be
arbitrary and agreement is strict and consistent. Number, on the other hand, is
generally not a feature a noun is inherently specified for though there are
exceptions, for example suppletive or irregular plural stems and pluralia
tantum, such as scissors or oats in English, which are indeed lexically plural,
but rather a feature of the noun phrase as a whole in a certain context in which
it is used to denote a plural referent. It might be possible to argue that in
English most count nouns are inherently singular because the form of their
lexical entry is identical to the singular form. In Mian, however, a lexical
citation form, e.g. naka ‘man’, is unspecified for number. Only the addition of
a determiners, e.g. the articles =e or =i clarifies whether one man or more that
one is/are being referred to.
    A two-gender analysis would have ramifications for the structure of the
Mian lexicon. Each of the two genders would contain both animate and
inanimate nouns and the entries for animates would differ considerably from
those for inanimates. While animate nouns can be specified for either gender
(mostly depending on sex) and then regularly have their plural marked with
184    4. Gender=i, some inanimates, such as imen ‘taro’, would need a feature ‘polaric’,
which indicates that the noun shows gender polarity when its number value is
changed. We cannot assume a general rule that makes all inanimates polaric
because some, such as káawa ‘steel axe’, do not show gender polarity and
therefore would have to be specified as invariant. Consequently, even a two-
gender analysis has to make a sub-classification within each gender, in other
words, it has to make reference to both gender and animacy to account for the
gender and number behaviour of any given noun.
   In summary, the two-gender analysis is plagued by the fact that it has to
assume polarity as a principle of Mian grammar. Furthermore, it is not more
parsimonious than the four-gender analysis since it also has to acknowledge a
four-way contrast. Hence, the solution I propose for Mian is to adopt the four-
gender analysis because it permits us to keep number and gender separate.
Rather than saying that a given inanimate noun, such as imen ‘taro’ is
masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural, this noun is lexically
specified as neuter 1, which forces the article to be =e in the singular and =o
in the plural. In other words, the correct agreement patterns follow directly
from the lexical gender specification of the noun.

Classificatory verb prefixes
5.0.      IntroductionA subset of the Mian verbal vocabulary (approximately 35 roots) requires a
classificatory prefix whose function is (a) to index the object of transitive
verbs and the subject of intransitive verbs and (b) to classify the object/subject
according to certain salient characteristics of its referent, namely sex, shape,
and function.
    Semantically, these verbs (with a few exceptions) refer to various forms of
manipulation, movement, and handling, for example ‘give’, ‘take’, ‘put’, ‘lift’,
‘turn’ ‘throw’, ‘bury’, and ‘fall’. As suggested by their semantics, most of
these verbs are transitive and their verbal prefixes have a classificatory
relation to the object, exceptions being the intransitive verb -mêin ‘fall’ and
the ambitransitive verb -bià ‘throw, erupt’, which can be used intransitively to
mean ‘erupt’. In these two cases the classification applies to the subject. Thus,
classificatory prefixes in Mian operate on an absolutive basis (Keenan 1984),
e.g.:(1)    báangkli=e          dob-ò-n-o=a
       stone_adze=SG.N1 3SG.M_CL.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
       ‘she took the báangkli adze and then ...’ [Afoksitgabáam](2)    Dabein   om-mêin                   tl-Ø-o=ta
       PN       3SG.F_CL.SBJ-fall.PFV     come.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
       ‘Dabein came falling down (i.e. from the sky) and ...’ [Sofelok, 1]Interestingly, it is precisely verbs of handling and object manipulation which
contain classificatory elements in a number of North American languages
which also operate on an absolutive basis, e.g. Navajo and Digueño (Hoijer
1945, Langdon 1970, Barron 1982).","[209, 210, 211]"

9.1.4.    Noun phrases as locative adjunctsThe target of the movement encoded by motion verbs is often just realized as a
noun phrase, in case of locations or places the noun appears without a
determiner. Noun phrases as locative adjuncts are never obligatory. In (13),
movement is towards a location, and in (14), it is towards a person:(13)     damìb       un-Ø-ib-bio=to

         ‘she was coming to her husband and then …’ [Flood]These locative adjuncts look like object noun phrases. However, in terms of
semantic roles these are always locatives. The main syntactic difference is that
objects are relativizable while locative adjuncts are not. Also there is a strong
tendency for all adjuncts to directly precede the verb, while objects of
transitive verbs are more mobile within the clause. Hence, I analyse locative
noun phrases as (locative) adjuncts of intransitive motion verbs rather than
core arguments (i.e. the objects) of what then would be a transitive motion
verb.","[362, 363, 364]"

         ‘He’s stolen my steel axe.’The forms of the ‘alone’-series are used as possessive pronouns, if one wants
to emphasize exclusive possession:(111) nlib                     am=o
      1PL.EXCL.POSS.alone       house=N2
      ‘our house alone’ (Smith and Weston 1974b: 47)There are phonological and syntactic reasons for analyzing the possessive
pronoun as a non-bound form in Mian, rather than a bound form.
   First, in careful speech, possessive pronouns are uttered as separate words.
   Second, possessive pronouns are suprasegmentally distinct from other
bound affixal material, in that they all bear a high tone whereas bound affixal
material is unspecified for tone in Mian. Third, if the possessive pronoun
precedes a noun beginning in a voiced stop, this stop is prenasalized.
   Finally, the possessive pronoun can be separated from the following noun
by the adjectives sin ‘old’, as illustrated in (108) above, and memâ ‘new’
(112):(112) n           memâ            am

3.7.3.     The bound pronoun seriesMian has two bound pronoun series, i.e. two series of pronouns that have to be
further inflected to form complex pronouns. The possessive pronoun (see
3.7.2) is not a bound form in Mian but its forms are identical to the bound
series. I call the bound series the ‘simple’ and the ‘alone’ bound series.
   The bound pronouns never occur as independent words. They are used as
the base to form the following five complex pronouns through suffixation:-     Emphatic pronouns with the suffix -ta (3.7.4)
-     Possessive pronouns with nominal function with the suffix -mi (3.7.5)
-     Negated pronouns with the suffix -kob (3.7.6)
-     Free ‘alone’ pronouns with the suffix -kiem (3.7.7)
-     Reflexive pronouns with the suffixes -ma(ye) or -skil (3.7.8)

9.10.1.     Argument order in transitive clausesAll overtly realized arguments are either free pronouns or full noun phrases.
Rarely, both subject and object are overtly realized as free pronouns. In such
cases, the subject always precedes the object. This is independent of whether
the object is indexed on the verb with prefix (89) or a suffix (90):(89)      n                    ya-têm’-Ø-i=bo

       ‘we left you and then someone else…’ [Crows]If the arguments are instantiated by full noun phrases instead of pronouns, the
unmarked constituent order is AOV. Overt subject noun phrases usually
precede object noun phrases. This order is very consistently observed in
elicited examples, e.g.:(91)   naka=e      unáng=o             wa-têm’-Ø-e=be
       man=SG.M woman=SG.F             3SG.F.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man saw the woman.’In natural discourse, however, relative order of subject and object noun
phrases is less consistently A followed by O. This usually does not create
ambiguities due to the language’s head-marking characteristics, which in most
cases allow the identification of syntactic relations through information from
the pronominal and classificatory affixes without having to take constituent
order information into account. Deviation from the unmarked order in natural
discourse will be discussed in 9.10.1 below.
    Although unmarked constituent order in Mian is AOV, verb-final position
is really all that is mandated. Hence, it is possible to invert subject and object
if both grammatical relations are realized by overt noun phrases.
    In many cases, argument indexing disambiguates as in example (92) where
the pronominal affixes -e and wa- clearly indicate that the man is the ‘seer’
and the woman the ‘seen’:(92)   unáng=o        naka=e     wa-têm’-Ø-e=be
       woman=SG.F man=SG.M 3SG.F.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man has seen the woman.’A natural example is (93) where argument indexing on the verb indicates who
leads whom. Preposed objects are typically topics and marked with the topic
clitic =le:(93)   memé         =le             Sobining=e
       children     PL.AN=TOP        PN=SG.M       del-êt-n-e=a
       PL.AN.O-take.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘As for the children, Sobining took them and then ...’ [Sobining]
364       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseI analyse examples like (93) as topicalizations rather than cleft structures
because there are no cues that suggest the latter analysis, such as presence of a
copula or an obvious bi-clausal structure.
   Argument inversion is not possible with pronominal subjects without topic
marking of the object. Compare (94) and (95):(94)      imen =le                n      wen-b-i=be
          taro     SG.N1=TOP       1SG eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘As for the taro, I’m eating (it).’(95)      *imen=e         n      wen-b-i=be
          taro=SG.N1      1SG eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          Intended: ‘I’m eating the taro.’This restriction is independent of whether the verb marks the object or not.
Thus, (96) is bad as well.(96)      *naka=e         n     a-têm’-Ø-i=be
          man=SG.M        1SG 3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          Intended: ‘I’ve seen the man.’I will mention here in passing that in (core-level) serial verb constructions,
overt object noun phrases can appear inside the verb serialization, if they are
exclusive to one of the verbs in the chain:(97)      dabáal=e            haka           dam=o
          ground=SG.N1        break.IPFV     body=SG.F          om-bù-Ø-e-bio=ta
          3SG.F_CL.O-bury.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ-GPST=MED
          ‘after he had dug up the ground and buried her, (the Niniktol
          vine…)’ [Afoksitgabáam]In this example, damo ‘(her) body’ is an argument of the verb ombuebiota ‘he
buried her’ not of haka ‘break’. For details, see section 11.1.1.3 on serial verb
constructions.","[388, 389, 390]"

7.2.     Simple spatial        postpositional   phrases    with   a   nominal
         postpositionThese consist of a noun phrase followed by a nominal postposition, which are
derived from nouns. Some (but not all) of these are also used as nouns in
contemporary Mian. The term nominal postposition is clarified further below.
   Nominal postpositions are:(14)   dim         ‘on, onto’
       tem         ‘in, into’
       tabáab      ‘under, beneath’
       glagl      ‘between’
       tib         ‘on(to) the surface of’The postpositions tem ‘in(to)’ and dim ‘on(to)’ are derived from nouns. For
tem ‘in(to)’, there is a homophonous nominal form with the meaning ‘hole,
inside’, cf. amún-tem [belly-hole] ‘abdominal cavity’ rather than *‘in(to) the
belly’. The noun dim ‘top’ is attested in the compound amgolim [am-go-dim
house-head-top] ‘roof’, rather than *‘onto the roof’. The postposition tib is
derived from the noun tib ‘outside (of hide or fur)’.
   Therefore, I choose the term ‘nominal postpositions’ for the five words
under discussion. Although neither tabáab ‘under, beneath’ nor glagl
‘between’ can be shown to be related to a noun in the way that tem ‘in(to)’ and
dim ‘on(to)’ are related to nouns, they behave the same syntactically and are
therefore included in the class of nominal postpositions. On the issue of the
nominal origin of postpositions in many languages, see Dryer (2007: 85-86).
   Two examples of nominal postpositions are provided below:(15)   tek=dim
       rope=on(to)
       ‘on(to) the rope’(16)   mikil=tabáab
       mountain=under
       ‘under the mountain (i.e. at the foot of the mountain)’
        7.2. Simple spatial postpositional phrases with a nominal postposition   237The postpositional phrase can be followed by an article. In this case the
postposition does not cliticize. The article agrees in gender and number with
the preceding noun. The following example shows that the article following
the postposition agrees in gender and number with tek ‘rope’ (N1):(17)   yóum=e                            tek          dim=e
       piece_of_clothing=SG.N1           rope(N1)     on(to)=SG.N1       do-fâ-n-ebo=be
       3SG.M_CL.O-put.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘You put the piece of clothing on the line.’In contrast to postpositional phrases with a directional postposition, in which
the noun phrase always has to be bare, in postpositional phrases with a
nominal postposition like dim ‘on(to)’ or tem ‘in(to)’ they can have an article,
but not any of the other adnominal pronouns:(18)   tek=e             dim(=e)
       rope=SG.N1        on(to)(=SG.N1)
       ‘on(to) the rope’Therefore, a structure like (19) above has probably originated in a noun
phrase, in which tek=e ‘the rope’ was the possessor:(19)   tek=e             dim(=e)
       rope=SG.N1        top(=SG.N1)
       ‘top of the rope’Further evidence for this etymology comes from the following construction
involving dim (20) and tem (21), where we find an appositional structure, in
which the possessor is cross-referenced by a possessive pronoun:(20)   itú=e                        dim=e
       fence=SG.N1         SG.N1     top=SG.N1
       ‘on the fence’ (lit. ‘the fence, its top’) [Building a Spirit House](21)   toli=e                           tem=e
       arrow_type=SG.N1           SG.N1  inside=SG.N1
       ‘(pierced) on (the tip of) a toli arrow’ (lit. ‘the toli arrow, its
       inside’) [Initiation rites]
238    7. The postpositional phraseIn these examples, an overt possessive pronoun cross-references the
possessors itú=e ‘the fence’ and toli=e ‘the toli arrow’, respectively. (On
attributive possession, see section 6.6). Note, however, that this construction is
only found in a traditional initiation account by a speaker in his late eighties. It
is not used by younger speakers.
    Unlike directionals which can only occur with an agreeing article or the
default article =o, nominal postpositions retain the nominal property of
occurring with different determiners. Emphatic pronouns (22) and
demonstratives (23) are attested:(22)    mikil                tabáab        ta
        mountain(N2)         beneath       N2.EMPH        bl-Ø-io=be
        stay.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
        ‘They live at the foot of (lit. beneath) mountains.’
        [Mammals and insects](23)    flèt=tem       le
        plate=in       DEM.PROX.SG.N1
        ‘on (lit. in) this plate’Nominal postpositions retain an important feature of nouns, namely to have an
article or other determiner, and therefore make the structures in which they
occur look like noun phrases in some respect. On the other hand, phrases with
nominal postpositions differ in their external syntax from noun phrases. They
are restricted to occurring with certain adverbial functions. Under no
circumstances can a phrase with a nominal postposition be in a core argument
position (see Dryer 2007: 85).
    Phonologically, the nominal postposition dim ‘on, onto’ fuses with nouns
ending in /l/, as in (24), the postposition tem ‘in, into’ fuses with nouns ending
in /t/, as in (25):(24)    dabáal=dim      [ndalîm]
        ground=on(to)
        ‘on(to) the ground’(25)    flèt=tem       [flthm]
        plate=in(to)
        ‘on(to) (lit. in(to)) the plate’
                        7.3. Postpositional phrases with complex postpositions   2397.3.      Postpositional phrases with complex postpositionsThese consist of a noun phrase complement and a complex postposition,
which can be segmented into sequences of two or three simple postpositions.
In complex postpositions, there is maximally one directional (ut ‘up’, daak
‘down’, etc.) as the final member, but there can be one or two nominal
postpositions (tabáab ‘under’, dim ‘on(to)’, tem ‘in(to)’, tib ‘on(to) the surface
of’, or glagl ‘between’) preceding the directional. Complex postpositions
typically follow a noun phrase as in (26) and (27), but there are also examples
in which they follow a bare noun, as in (28):(26)    két=e                dim-ut
        container=SG.N1      on(to)-up
        ‘up on(to) the container’ [Spatial reference](27)    két=e              tabáab-tem-daak

corpus. The constituent elements of complex postpositions are dim ‘on(to)’,
tem ‘in(to)’, glagl ‘between’, tabáab ‘under’, tib ‘outside of’, daak ‘down’,
ut ‘up’, tab ‘down’, tm ‘sideways’, wt ‘across’.","[262, 263, 264, 265]"

Embedding
13.0.     IntroductionMian has four types of embedded structure. These are:-   quotative sentences
-   adverbial clauses
-   head-internal relative clauses
-   prenominal relative clausesThese four structures can be distinguished with respect to their syntactic
category and the structures into which they are embedded.
    Quotatives are full sentences, i.e. they receive marking for illocutionary
force, e.g. =bo for quotatives, =a for embedded polar questions, =e for
embedded content questions, or =e ~ =o ‘hortative’. These are always
embedded as sentential complements of the function verb ge/ga ‘say’.
    Adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses display clausal syntax
but are formally marked as noun phrases, i.e. they occur with a proper subset
of the determiners which fill the determiner slot in ordinary noun phrases. It is
quite typical for Papuan languages to treat adverbials and relatives formally
the same, the functional reason for this being that both types of clause provide
background information (Foley 1986: 202).
    Prenominal relative clauses are embedded within noun phrases. They do
not receive any overt marking. There is no subordinator, determiner and no
illocutionary marking.
    Embedded structures are on a different syntactic level with respect to their
matrix clauses because in complex sentences, embedded clauses are skipped
by the switch reference (S/R) morphology operating in the main clause, i.e.
S/R is calculated with respect to the next clause after the embedded structure.
    Verbs in simple embedded clauses are morphologically very similar to
independent sentence-final verbs, e.g. both the former and the latter can be
inflected for irrealis mood whereas medial verbs cannot. All embedded
structures can be complex themselves. They can consist of a clause chain
themselves. In such cases, the last clause has a final verb and all clauses in the
embedded chain have medial verbs with S/R morphology pertaining only to
subject tracking and to the temporal structure of the events in the embedded
clause chain. In other words, S/R morphology only tracks subjects across
486       13. Embeddingclauses on the same syntactic level. Subject-tracking never reaches into
embedded clauses or out of embedded clauses into the matrix clause.
   Verbs in embedded quotatives are always fully independent of any
information marked on the final verb in the matrix clause. Verbs in embedded
adverbials and relative clauses are only minimally dependent on the matrix
verb in that it always has to have the same illocutionary force value. This
dependency is familiar from clause chains. Unlike medial clauses, however,
verbs in embedded adverbial and relative clauses have their own TAM value
and are independent of any negation on the matrix verb, as shown in (1).
Adverbial clauses are “impervious to denial from such following clauses”
(Haiman 1980: 142), e.g.:(1)       bomânomo        balubib=e        aai=e
          tomorrow        airstrip=SG.N1   water=SG.N1          êi-n-em-e=o
          accumulate-AUX.PFV-COND-3SG.N1.SBJ=N2          balu=e=mo                tl-aamab-e=ba=be
          plane=SG.N1=NEG          come.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ=NEG=DECL
          ‘If tomorrow the airstrip accumulates water, the plane won’t come.’Habitual marking likewise never extends to an adverbial clause. The hitting of
cats cannot be interpreted as habitual in (2):(2)       kbo        busi   i-nâ’-n-em-eb=o
          2SG.M       cat    PL.AN.O-hit.PFV-AUX.PFV-COND-2SG.SBJ=N2                     meou        ga-bina-b-io=be

          ‘If you hit a cat, it (habitually) meows’ [TMA questionnaire, 75]
13.1.       Embedded quotatives13.1.1.     Quotatives as sentential complementsQuotative sentences are used to represent discourse. They are always
embedded as sentential complements of the function verb ge/ga ‘say’. Verbs
in simple embedded quotative sentences display final verb morphology and
either take a clitic =bo ‘Quotative’, as in (3), or have a hortative verb form

        should go to Gubil.”, he said to me.’)The function verb which takes the quotative as a complement is usually
serialized with another verb specifying the mode of expression, e.g. baa ‘say
(PFV)’ in the examples above or fun ‘think (IPFV)’ in (5):(5)     n      funa-n-i=a

       ‘I think/thought I should go to Gubil.’If the function verb is inflected, any more specific verb regarding the mode of
expression, such as baa ‘say (PFV)’ or fun ‘think (IPFV)’ must be left out.
    Embedded quotatives can be preceded by an ‘introductory’ medial clause
whose verb specifies the mode of expression, e.g. baa-n-e=a ‘he says’ or
funa-n-i=a ‘I think’. This medial verb has to be in the perfective. This is
illustrated by the examples (3) to (7). This ‘introductory’ medial clause is not
obligatory and can be left out without creating a difference in meaning. The
first verb in (8) genoa ‘she said’ follows the previous quotative complement,
here abbreviated as [...].(8)    [...]   ge-n-o=a

slot. If the subject of this verb is first person singular, -n unequivocally
indicates same subject and event sequentiality (see 11.2.3.1). In such a case it
is obvious that subject co-reference is not calculated with respect to the
embedded sentence but with respect to the matrix verb following the
embedded quotative sentence, which is skipped by the S/R system:(9)    n       funa-n-i=a                            [Milsen=e      Gubil

view of the external speaker (see for example Munro 1982). An illustration is

taman unaamabibe ‘I want to go to the Boutlantema valley’.
   An example with a transitive verb in the embedded quotative is given in
(12). I use the index ‘k’ to track the source (of the original utterance) and the
index ‘l’ for the external speaker:(12)              sintalo        baa-n-e=a

       ‘Yesterday, hek told mel that hek saw mel’ (lit. ‘Yesterday, hek told
       mel: “Ik saw youl.”’)Pronominal deixis is relative. The external speaker (indexed ‘l’) represents the
utterance of the source speaker (indexed ‘k’). The original utterance would
have been n kbo katêm’ibe ‘I saw you’.

‘say’, which can be either inflected itself or a bare verb stem in serialization
with an inflected speech act verb, such as baa ‘say (PFV)’.
    Embedded polar questions are marked with two illocutionary clitics,
namely =a ‘Question’ and =bo (or =ba) to mark the question as quotative, as
in (13). Embedded content questions, as in (14), are only marked with =e:(13)      [kwéit=e             hei-ˆt’-ne

"
10.2.     Content questionsIn content questions, the speaker requests information about some participant,
theme, location, time, manner, etc. of an event or action. The proposition of a
content question is presupposed apart from the queried constituent.
   Content questions are formed with the interrogative clitic =e (=ne after
vowel). It encliticizes to the (clause-final) finite verb or the interrogative
phrase. Content questions are never marked by the interrogative particle m.
   Apart from being flagged with the interrogative clitic =e, content questions
also involve one of the two basic question words or interrogative words fàb
‘where’ (18) or wan ‘who’ (19), which have further semantic extensions into
other epistemic domains (see below):(18)    fàb      un-Ø-eb=e?
        where    go.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=CQ
        ‘Where do you go?’(19)    wan-ta                   kàb      le

        smash.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=CQ
        ‘Who’s broken this cup?’ [TMA questionnaire, 127]Semantically, the two interrogative words almost exactly divide the world up
into animates (wan ‘who’), on the one hand, and inanimates and adverbials
(fàb ‘where, what’), on the other. The only exception to this rule is that wan
plus emphatic pronoun is employed to find out about people’s names, which
are not strictly animate but nonetheless important properties of people.
                                                     10.2. Content questions   391    The interrogative words fàb and wan neither encode number nor gender.
Emphatic pronouns, which can be compounded with both fàb and wan, have
to encode number and in the third person singular also gender. Mian
interrogative words do not overlap with relative pronouns and they are
semantically unambiguous, i.e. they do not have alternative interpretations as
indefinites, as interrogatives do for example in Japanese (Nichigauchi 1990)
or in the Australian languages Kayardild (Evans 1995: 365) and Kuuk
Thaayorre (Gaby 2006: 243-244). Both fàb and wan can be used pronominally
and adnominally.
    Content questions in Mian usually have declarative (i.e. falling) intonation,
but can be intonationally marked by a quick rise and subsequent fall of pitch
on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is invariably formed by the
illocutionary particle. This intonational pattern is very similar to the one found
in polar questions.
    The interrogative clitic =e can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to indicate that the speaker assumes that the addressee wants this action
to be performed by the speaker (or by a group to which both speaker and
addressee belong), e.g.:(20)      fàb      o-fâ-n-an=e?
          where    3SG.RESID.O-put.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ.HORT =CQ
          ‘Where shall I put it?’ [Observed]Interrogative phrases, which contain the interrogative words fàb and wan,
always appear in situ, i.e. they occur in the same position as non-interrogative
phrases with the same grammatical function (Li and Thompson 1984: 51,
Dryer 2005).
   As in polar and alternative questions, constituent order is not changed with
respect to the corresponding declarative sentence and the interrogative phrase
occupies the position which the queried constituent would have in an
appropriate answer sentence.
   There are a few cases where the interrogative phrase seems to be not in situ
but rather to be postposed after the verb. I will turn to this issue in more detail
below.","[416, 417]"
"
9.13.      A note on causativesLike many languages, Mian has lexical causatives where an intransitive verb
and its causative counterpart are realized as distinct lexical verb stems:(154) Intransitive                 Causative
      ein ‘cook’                   fu ‘cook’
      kaan ‘die (PFV)’             -nâ’ ‘kill (PFV)’
      bokbok ge ‘boil (PFV)’       bafu ‘boil’In addition to this, ambitransitive verbs have a causative element as part of
their meaning when used transitively, cf. halò ‘break (intransitive) vs. halò
382    9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause‘(cause to) break (transitive)’ or dòu ‘close (intransitive)’ vs. dòu ‘(cause to)
close (transitive)’. On ambitransitives, see 9.3.
    There is no morphological causative. The syntactic causative construction
is a special form of verb serialization consisting of (exactly) two verbs, where
subject marking is used to index the causer on the first verb and the causee on
the second verb. For more information on causative serializations, see 11.1.5.
An example of a causative serialization is given in (155):(155) geim=e                          tob-â’-i
      pronged_arrow=SG.N1             3SG.LONG.O-let_go.PFV-1SG.SBJ       un-Ø-e=be
       go.PFV-REAL-3SG.N1.SBJ=MED
       ‘I dropped the pronged arrow.’ (lit. ‘I let go of the arrow and it
       went.’)What I would like to do in the remainder of this section is to discuss one case
that has been identified as the “Mian causative construction” in the literature.
Smith and Weston (1974b: 138) claim that: “[t]he verb kimanin ‘watch over,
command’ is used in the first clause of a sequence sentence [i.e. a clause
chaining construction – SF]” to indicate a cause-effect relation. They give one
example. Morpheme breakdown, glosses and translation are Smith and
Weston’s (1974a: 139):6(156) awok-o           men-e         ki-mab-o               a     aay-e
      mother-CM        child-CM      command-FUT-she        SEQ   water-CM       fuela-n-a-mab-e        bo
       bathe-PU-NU-FUT-he     IND.EMPH
       ‘The mother will command the child and he will bathe.’ i.e. ‘The
       mother will make the child bathe.’Based on Smith and Weston’s data and glosses Song (1996: 36-37) classifies
the construction in (156) as an overt AND type of causative in his typological
survey of causatives, i.e. a biclausal construction with an overt coordinating
element, in this case a ‘sequential’ connecting the clauses specifying cause
and effect. Before going into the question whether this construction is really a
causative, the morphological analysis has to be corrected.
   First, Smith and Weston analyse -mab in kimabo erroneously as a future
form though medial verbs in Mian are never inflected with -mab (which I
gloss as ‘irrealis’). Although they do not explicitly say so, no forms inflected
                                               9.13. A note on causatives   383with -mab appear in their table summarizing the morphology of the medial
verb nor do any of their examples have medial verbs inflected with -mab.
   Second, the verb involved is not ki but rather is kimâa’ ‘watch over (PFV)’
(with a pharyngealized /a/). This verb cannot be inflected directly in the
imperfective but needs an auxiliary before it can be inflected (cf. the verbal
noun kimâa’-nin ‘(activity of) watching over’, where nin is the verbal noun of
the existential verb).
   My analysis of (156) above is:(157) awók=o           mn=e
      mother=SG.F      child=SG.M       kimâa’-bi-Ø-o=a7
       watch_over.PFV-AUX.IPFV-DS.SIM-3SG.F.SBJ=MED       aaie     fuela-n-amab-e=bo
       water    bathe.PFV-AUX.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-3SG.M.SBJ=EMPH
       ‘While the mother is watching over the child, it will bathe.’The second issue with Smith and Weston’s analysis is semantic in nature.
Although it is true that the verbal noun kimâa’nin can be used as a noun with
the meaning ‘boss, minder’, the verb stem kimâa’ essentially means ‘watch
over, look out for (PFV)’ and not ‘command’. There is not a single instance in
my corpus where kimâa’ could be felicitously translated as ‘command’. In my
view, it is mainly the glossing of kimâa’ as ‘command’ that suggests that we
are dealing with a causative construction.
   Furthermore, even the assumption of a potential causative construction
with kimâa’ ‘watch over (PFV)’ in a medial clause indicating causation, is not
supported by my data. Nowhere does the clause following a medial clause
with kimâa’ express an effect related to a causer, who would be the subject of
kimâa’.
   To conclude, I am very sceptical as to whether a causative analysis of the
construction in (157) is valid. Such constructions may have a causative
implicature at best but they are not dedicated causatives.
Chapter 10
Question formation
10.0.      IntroductionThis chapter deals with the formation of questions. Formally, there are five
different types of question in Mian. Questions can employ:1)      only the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a at the end of the sentence
2)      bleka ‘or’ at the end of the sentence, and no interrogative clitic =a
3)      the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a at the end of the sentence and
        bleka ‘or’ inside the sentence (separating two alternatives)
4)      the interrogative illocutionary clitic =e plus an interrogative phrase with
        either fàb ‘where’ or wan ‘who’
5)      the topic clitic =leFunctionally, these can be assigned to the following types:
    Types (1) and (2) are polar questions, i.e. questions for which the
appropriate answer is ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
    Type (3) are alternative questions, where the speaker wants a specification
of the offered alternatives, e.g. Do you want pork or fish for dinner?.
    Type (4) are content questions, which are used to request information about
the who, what, when, etc. of an event or action. Content questions consist of a
proposition which is completely presupposed apart from one element, which is
the one queried (Givón 1990: 714-715). In Mian, the maximum number of
queried constituents is one. Thus, multiple constituent questions, such as
English Who did what?, are not possible.
    Type (5) are topic-only questions, in which only a topic is given, as in
English What about John? or And you?. The speaker has a particular question
in mind, and it must be obvious from the context what the implied question is.","[407, 408, 409, 410, 411]"
"This is illustrated for -dum ‘with’ (41) and -dofa ‘about’ (42):

10.2.6.     Fatnàmin plus the nominal postposition dim ‘on’The interrogative word fatnàmin can function as the complement of the
nominal postposition dim ‘on’, yielding fatnàmin dim ta ‘when’, which is
formally a postpositional phrase (see section 7.2 on nominal postpositions like
dim ‘on’ and 7.5 on temporal postpositional phrases):(43)      fatnàmin   dim   -ta          tl-Ø-eb-bu=e?

          ‘When did you come?’
10.2.7.     The interrogative word wanThe interrogative word wan ‘who’ is used to inquire about the identity of
animates including their names.
   There are four variants wan, un and wal, ul. The variation between /wa/
and /u/ is free and can be found in other areas of Mian grammar, e.g. in the
variation of the object agreement prefix wa- ~ u- (see 8.5.3). The variants wal
and ul have the morphophonemic variants wale and ule if the following
emphatic pronoun start in /i/, there is. Thus, the forms for the second and third
person plural are walibta/ulibta ‘who (you PL)’ and walita/ulita ‘who
(they)’, respectively.
   Without an emphatic pronoun, wan only occurs in questions about
possessors. Like possessors expressed by full noun phrases, the interrogative
word wan precedes the possessed. Either the pronominal article =e in the
singular masculine form (44) or =i in the animate plural form (45) is
obligatory:

        ‘Whose (people’s) dog is this?’In questions about the identity of a certain individual wan ‘who’ has to be
compounded with an emphatic pronoun, such as ta ‘he (EMPH)’ (see 3.7.4).
The interrogative clitic =e is used to mark interrogative illocution. When =e
follows the pronoun suffix -ta, this suffix is realized as -t, as in (46) and (47):(46)    bo    wan-bt=e?

verb:

       ‘Who are you looking at?’In ditransitives, content questions about either the recipient (51) or the theme
(52) are possible, but not both in the same clause. The maximal number of
queried constituents is restricted to one:(51)   buk=o         wan-ta

       PL.AN.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-REAL-2SG.SBJ=CQ
       ‘What did you give to the man?’The use of the classificatory prefix dl- ‘plural animate object’ in the last
example does not entail that the referent of the object is animate and plural.
Rather it is used as a default form in content questions about the object, i.e.
when the identity of the object referent is unknown and queried. For inquiring
about inanimate objects, see section 10.2.4 on fatnàmin ‘what’ above.
   The combination wan ‘who’ plus emphatic pronoun is used in a non-verbal
construction to inquire about proper names, which are important properties of
humans and some animals. Example (53) is the idiomatic way of inquiring
about a man’s name. To ask about a woman’s name wanbte has to be used.(53)   kb              ninín=o=le       wan-kbt=e?

       ‘What is your (M) name?’ (lit. ‘As for your (M) name, who

also be used adnominally as an interrogative modifier. In adnominal position it
means ‘which’:

The interrogative phrase is in subject position (i.e. in situ) and the verb is
marked for interrogative illocution, whereas (56), on the other hand, does not
consist of a finite clause but rather of a topic-comment construction with a
head-internal relative clause in topic position, namely kàb=e klutâ-n-e =le

9.11.     Non-verbal clausesNon-verbal clauses are topic-comment constructions consisting of a non-finite
predicate (the comment) and exactly one argument (the topic). The predicate
is followed by the predicator =o. The topic is non-obligatory and thus can be
left out if its identity is obvious or retrievable from the linguistic or extra-
linguistic context. Non-verbal predicates always are one-place predicates and
can consist of a pronoun or noun (including proper names and verbal nouns),
an adjective, or an adverb.
    Like clauses with finite verbs, non-verbal clauses are marked for
illocutionary force. The range of illocutionary markers, however, is slightly
more restricted since non-verbal predications cannot be hortatives. One finds
=be ‘Declarative’, =bo ‘Emphatic/quotative’, =ble ‘Exclamative’, =a
‘Question’ and =e ‘(Content) Question’. For interrogatory non-verbal
predications, see 10.1.1.
    An example of a declarative non-verbal predication is:(118) Iliba=e       tíl=o=be
      PN=SG.M       dog=PRD=DECL
      ‘Iliba is a dog.’Any noun phrase is permitted as the topic argument. This noun phrase can
consist of a free or inflected pronoun or a headless adjective. If the identity of
the referent of the topic noun phrase is obvious it is commonly left out:(119) tíl=o=be
      dog=PRD=DECL
      ‘It’s a dog.’The reader should note that the pronoun ‘it’ in the free translation is not meant
to be taken as referential. ‘It’ does not refer to any entity which happens to be
a dog. Nothing in the Mian utterance tíl=o=be actually refers to the entity
about which the predication is made.
   There is no predicator in questions:
372       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause(120) tíl=a?
      dog=Q
      ‘Is it a dog?’If the predicate term ends in a vowel the predicator =o is usually left out, even
in non-interrogatory contexts. However, occasionally =o is put in even under
these circumstances. Compare more frequent (121) and less frequent (122)
with the same meaning:(121) naka=be
      man=DECL
      ‘It is a man.’(122) naka=o=be
      man=PRD=DECL
      ‘It is a man.’
9.11.1.     IdentityNon-verbal predications express more or less permanent states, as opposed to
temporary ones. They are commonly used to state the identity of some
referent:(123) n         Bikene=i      unáng=o=bo
      1SG        PN=PL.AN      woman=PRD=QUOT          ge        baa-s-o=a
          say.PFV say.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
          ‘ “I am a woman of the Bikene (people)” she said, and then someone
          else…’ [Dimosson]The following example (124) illustrates the reversed order of the topic and the
comment, see ungrammatical (125), if the predicate term is a proper name, kin
noun, or dyad (when the predication is about identity). In this case the topic
has to be an emphatic pronoun, compare grammatical (124) with
ungrammatical (126):(124) Kasening        n-ta=be
          PN          1SG-EMPH=DECL
          ‘I’m Kasening.’

          PN              1SG=DECL
          Intended: ‘I’m Kasening.’
9.11.2.    PropertyAnother common function of non-verbal predications is to predicate certain
properties of a referent:(127) ngáamein=o=be
      yellow=PRD=DECL
      ‘It is yellow.’(128) ninín     Sofelok lo          sino      awém=o=be
      name      PN       DEM.N2      before taboo=PRD=DECL
      ‘Before, this name Sofelok was taboo.’ [Sofelok, 2]In non-verbal predications which designate properties one also finds a variant
which involves =na ‘too’ which is possibly derived from the verb stem na
‘do’. The meaning is that the topic argument – apart from other potential
properties – also has the property predicated about it by the predicate term.
This construction can be used only with adjectives:(129) wan     le                      ilem=na=be
      bird    DEM.PROX.SG.M            red=too=DECL
      ‘This bird is also red (in addition to some other colour(s)).’(130) as=e             milil     eka teke=na=be
      tree=SG.N1       black     and long=too=DECL
      ‘The tree is black and also tall.’Although =na might have originated in the verb na, it cannot be inflected in
property predications. Therefore, I treat this construction as non-verbal.
374       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause9.11.3.     PossessionNon-verbal predications can be used to indicate possession. In non-verbal
possessive constructions, the predicate can be a possessive pronoun with
nominal function, e.g. nmi ‘mine’, kbmi ‘yours’ and nlemi ‘mine alone’,
kelebmî ‘yours alone’, etc., as in (131) with a topic term and in (132) without
one:(131) táang      le                         nmi=be
      flint      DEM.PROX.SG.N1              mine=DECL
      ‘This lighter is mine.’(132) nmi=be
      mine=DECL
      ‘It is mine.’An alternative way of expressing possession with a non-verbal clause is to
inflect a noun with -sa ‘with’ as the predicate term, as in (133) and (134):(133) unáng=o          amún-sa=be
      woman=SG.F       belly-with=DECL
      ‘The woman is pregnant.’ (lit. ‘is with belly’)(134) n      am-sa=be
      1SG     house-with=DECL
      ‘I have a house.’ (lit. ‘am with house’)On attributive possession, see section 6.5. On derivational suffixes on nouns,
see 3.1.5.","[397, 398, 399, 400]"
"
3.1.4.    Noun-to-verb derivationMian has one derivational process which productively derives verbs from
nouns. Nouns can take the verbalizing suffix -an to form an inchoative verb
with the meaning ‘to become N’ to which regular verbal morphology can be
suffixed. An example is provided below:(10)     konokmôn-an-n-amab-i=be
         old_woman-VBLZ-AUX.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
         ‘I will be an old woman.’ (Smith and Weston 1974b: 38)
92       3. Word classes and grammatical relations3.1.5.      Noun-to-adverb/adjective derivationMian expresses some adverbial meanings for which other languages use
adpositional phrases by appending a derivational suffix to a noun and thus
deriving an adverb from it. The elements that are appended to the noun are
suffixes rather than postposition because they exclusively attach to nouns
rather than noun phrases. The noun cannot be modified or quantified in any
way, nor can it by followed by an article or other determiner. The syntactic
position of the resulting adverb is before the verb. The inventory of these
derivational suffixes comprises:(11)      -besa       ‘without’
          -daa        ‘at (locative)’
          -deib       ‘for (purposive, cf. deib ‘road’)
          -dikin      ‘like (in comparisons)’
          -dofa       ‘about, because of (causal)’
          -dum        ‘with (instrumental)’In the following I provide some examples, which illustrates the use of
denominal adverbs further:(12)      n       afoksmîk=o     asumâtna fút-besa
          1SG      hour=N2        three        tobacco-without
          ‘I (have gone) three hours without a smoke.’ [Observed](13)                 éil-dikin     ngaan-b-e=be
          3SG.M       pig-like      call_out.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
          ‘He is calling out like a pig.’(14)      unáng         lo                   anat-dum
          woman         DEM.PROX.SG.F         arrow-with          bina-b(H)-io=be
          shoot.PFV-NHODPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
          ‘They shot this woman with an arrow.’Apart from -dum, which can be combined with any instrument involved in an
action, there is also -tub ‘with (the hand)’, which is exclusively used in
collocation with the noun kwéil ‘hand’, thus, kwéil-tub ‘with the hand,
manually’:
                                                               3.1. Nouns     93(15)            kwéil-tub     klâ-n-e=be
         3SG.M hand-with       make-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
         ‘He made it manually.’There is one derivational noun suffix -sa with the meaning of having what the
noun says as a property, and one suffix -gam ‘covered with (of substances or
skin diseases)’. The resulting derivations are adjectives rather than adverbs.
They are used to make predications about an argument but are not themselves
modifiers of the predicate:(16)             amún-sa=be
         3SG.F belly-with=DECL
         ‘She is pregnant.’ (lit. ‘with belly’) [Observed](17)              afuei-gam             biaan-o=ta=be
         3SG.F     skin_lesion-covered   stay.IPFV.SS.SIM-3SG.F=MED=DECL
         ‘she was covered with weeping sores’ [Afueiwok]The meaning of nouns undergoing derivation with -sa or -gam is attributive
rather than adverbial. A noun inflected with -sa can fill the postnominal
modifier slot in a noun phrase just like any other adjectival modifier.
Compare:(18)     imen     s m=e
         taro     big=SG.N1

         taro     ash-with=SG.N1    cook-AUX.IPFV
         ‘(she) was cooking a taro with ash (on its tuber)’ [Fitibkanib and
         Dimosson]
3.1.6.     Adjective-to-noun derivationThere is marginal zero conversion of adjectives into nouns. This mainly
applies to dimensional adjectives and some others that denote physical
properties, such as s m ‘big, size’, teke ‘long, length’, and abil ‘heavy,
weight’.
94       3. Word classes and grammatical relations3.1.7.      Proper names and kin nounsProper names usually occur with a cliticized article reflecting the sex of the
bearer of the name, i.e. =e for males and =o for females. Alternatively, proper
names can be followed by any of the pronoun series except the two sets of
demonstratives. Proper names cannot be possessed. Kin nouns, e.g. awók
‘mother’, do not show any of these restrictions.
    Traditionally, a child would be given one first name and receive his or her
father’s first name as a patronymic, e.g. Tabtekeb Skiniab, Milimab Tabtekeb,
Kasening Milimab. These are three example names of grandfather, father, and
son. Today, some families have settled on a male name from an earlier
generation and use it as a family name. For example, most of Kasening’s
children use ‘Milimab’ (Milimab having been their grandfather) as their
family name, though in this particular case the oldest two children opted for
‘Kasening’ as their second name.
    Traditional female names are: Kukdim, Seimabneng, Selem, Umsin,
Wentak. Traditional male names are: Asuneng, Awaseb, Bongsab, Buseb,
Dab, Kasening, Kub, Liden, Mutumab, Nontlin, Obrib, Obet, Yangsin,
Yatemanab.
    Nowadays, biblical names, such as Deniel, Ebel, Eron, Ismael, Jeremia,
Raphael, and Simon, and modern western names, like Leoni, Gerome,
Raymond, Albet, Max, Milsen, and Viola are common.
    Group names are transparent compounds consisting of a proper name
designating a certain group of people and either of the nouns mín ‘son’, món
‘daughter’ or in the plural tn ‘people’, e.g. Usalei-mín ‘man from the
Mianmin group living in Gubil’, Usalei-món ‘woman from the Mianmin
group living in Gubil’, Usalei-tn, ‘the Mianmin group living in Gubil’.
    Dogs are the only animals which are given names. Domestic pigs or birds
(e.g. hornbills or cassowaries) remain nameless.
    Place names are usually transparent compounds consisting of a proper
name and either of the nouns am ‘house’ (Mian-am ‘Mianmin village’,
Oksab-am ‘Oksapmin station’), bil ‘hill’ (Nene-bil ‘Nenebil’), fib ‘river
confluence’ (Tobafafib ‘Tobafafib’), bib ‘village, hamlet’ (Skiobib ‘Skiobib’),
or taman ‘valley’ (Boutlantema taman ‘Boutlantema valley’).
    The inventory of kin terms comprises the following: aaleb ‘father’, awók
‘mother’, imak ‘husband’, alél ‘wife’, i ‘dad’, biém ‘mum, and all of
mother’s sisters and the wives of her brothers’, ning ‘younger brother’, neng
‘younger sister’, hek (sm) ‘older (oldest) brother’, âam ‘older sister’, en
(sm) ‘older (oldest) sister’, máamein ‘mother’s brother’, báab ‘parent’s
younger sister’, akuláb ‘parent’s older sister’, nokâi ‘mother’s father, all of his
brothers and husbands of his sisters, father-in-law of a man’, ayàl ‘father’s
father, all of his brothers and husbands of his sisters, father-in-law of a
                                                                 3.1. Nouns   95woman’, afok ‘grandmother, all sisters of grandparents and all wives of
brothers of grandparents, any female ancestor’, baliam ‘male
ancestor/descendent’, mín ‘son’, món ‘daughter’, aaling ‘father’s younger
brother’, ayàab ‘father’s older brother’, andanek ‘husband’s father-in-law’,
andlok ‘husband’s mother-in-law’, aneis ‘in-law’.
    It is uncommon among adults to use a person’s name in direct address.
Rather, kin terms are used. Parents call their children by their first names more
often. Both proper names and kin nouns are used with the vocative clitic
particle =o when addressing someone, e.g. Kasening=o [PN=VOC]
‘Kasening!’, biém=o [mum=VOC] ‘Mum!’.
    Both proper names and kin nouns can be suffixed with -wal. Affixation of
-wal to proper names forms associative plurals (Moravcsik 2003) of the
pattern ‘X and associates’, e.g. Kasening-wal ‘Kasening and his
people/family’ (Tok Pisin ‘lain bilong Kasening’). With kin nouns, -wal can
either signal plural or associative plural, e.g. awók-wal ‘the mothers’ or ‘the
mother and her people/family’. The plural suffix -wal is also used with dyads
but generally not with common nouns. However, most nouns denoting offices,
such as kiab ‘patrol officer’ and kaunsol ‘councillor’ behave like kin nouns in
that they take -wal in the plural, e.g. kiab-wal ‘patrol officers’ and
kaunsol-wal ‘councillors’. -Wal is also used to mark the plural of agkit
‘female (animal)’ and yolowôk ‘giant beetle species’. However, in these two
cases the use of -wal to mark plural is optional. -Wal is possibly also present
as a fossilized part of the noun bebuali ‘butterfly’.
    Kin nouns tend to occur with the collective article =o (following the plural
suffix -wal) instead of regular =i for animate plural.","[117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"

11.2.2.     Medial versus final verbsMany Papuan languages that have clause chaining and S/R systems display a
difference in morphological complexity of medial verbs compared to
sentence-final verbs, which appear as the predicate of the last clause in a
clause chain. Compared to final verbs, medial verbs are commonly
morphologically impoverished. See Roberts (1997) for a typological survey of
S/R systems in New Guinea languages.
    In the simplest case, medial verbs are only marked for co-reference of
subject, not for tense or person/number of the subject. The following example
from Usan (Numugenan family, Madang Province) (Reesink 1987) is found in
Reesink (1983: 217 and pers. comm.):(36)      ye      nam     su-ab      is-omei
          I       tree    cut-SS     go_down-1SG.FAR.PAST
          ‘I cut the tree and (I) went down.’Often the marker has additional temporal meaning, ‘portmanteau-ed’ into the
same formative, e.g. sequential or simultaneous. This is the case in Fasu (West
Kutubuan family, Southern Highlands Province) (Loeweke and May 1980)
and Kalam (Kalam family, Madang Province) (Pawley 1966, Pawley 1987,
Pawley 1993). The following example is from Kalam (Pawley 1993: 101):(37)      kwt     d-y                  nwp pk-p-yn
          stick   hold-SS.PRIOR        him hit-PFV-2SG
          ‘You hit him with a stick.’ (lit. ‘You took a stick and hit him.’)
                          11.2. Medial verb morphology and clause chaining   423The DS-forms of medial verbs are usually more complex. They can carry a
subject marker, which indicates DS while the SS form is zero, e.g. in Fore
(Gorokan family, Eastern Highlands) (Scott 1978), or they can have an
anticipatory subject marker which indicates person and number of the
following subject, as in Hua (Gorokan family, Eastern Highlands) (Haiman
1980: 187-189).
    In other languages, one finds portmanteaux DS markers, for example in
Kobon (Davies 1981) and Usan, where the DS marker also contains
information on subject person and number without this being segmentable as a
distinct morpheme. The following Usan example is from Reesink (1983: 218
and pers. comm.):(38)   ye      nam      su-ine         is-orei
       I       tree     cut-1SG.DS     go_down-3SG.FAR.PAST
       ‘I cut the tree (and it went) down.’Medial verbs can have separate suffixes for disjoint reference and for subject
person and number, as for example in Kalam (Pawley 1993: 94):(39)   an     ag-e-k                   g-a-k?
       who    say-DS.PRIOR-3SG         do-3SG-PST
       ‘Who told him to do it?’ (lit. ‘Who said and he did it?’)So in these typical examples of S/R in Papuan languages we find a situation
where medial verbs are different from final verbs in that not all medial verbs
are marked for subject person and/or subject number (e.g. SS medial verbs
often occur without an affix cross-referencing the subject), they often cannot
be marked for various categories, such as irrealis mood or absolute tense, i.e. a
tense category which has the moment of speaking as its deictic centre (Comrie
1985), and the formatives that medial and final verbs allow are formally and
functionally distinct.
   In Mian we find a less grammaticalized S/R system, characteristic of
languages of the West Papuan Highlands, e.g. Dani (Bromley 1981) and
Kapauku (Ekagi) (William Foley, pers. comm.). Mian also makes frequent use
of clause chaining in discourse, but here the situation is different in that
medial verbs resemble final verbs much more than in the languages above.
Mian medial verbs:-   convey aspectual information through the aspectual stem
    distinction unless the verb is trans-aspectual.
-   are always marked for subject and any additional argument(s) in
    the same way as if the verb occurred in an independent sentence.
424       11. Chaining constructions-     take a range of markers in their pre-subject suffix slot which
      convey temporal and S/R information. These are homophonous
      with a subset of those found in the pre-subject slot in final verbs
      (see 8.6.1 and 11.2.6.2).
-     can be marked for the tense categories ‘General past’ and
      ‘Hesternal past’ to locate an event in the (general) past or
      yesterday, respectively.
-     are directly inflected or serialized with an auxiliary stem of the
      existential verb. Medial verbs can occur with a proper subset of the
      auxiliary stems found in final verbs.","[448, 449, 450]"

extent – by making reference to the interaction of vowel length with other
suprasegmental phenomena, such as tone/pitch and syllable structure, and
morphological processes, such as compounding and cliticization, which lead
to polysyllabic shortening. This is what I have done in my thesis (Fedden
2007a). In the following, I sketch this account and its issues.
    Smith and Weston’s “lengthened” vowels become much shorter when
additional material cliticizes to a (nominal) word, such as the articles =e, =o,
and =i or the predicator =o (followed by the declarative clitic =be), or when a
noun stem is compounded with another noun stem. In all of these cases the
phonological word becomes at least disyllabic which leads to polysyllabic
shortening (Lehiste 1972, Klatt 1976).
    Table 2.3 gives some data for vowel length in bare noun stems and
cliticized or compounded noun stems. The vowel length value is the middle
out of two tokens of each word uttered in isolation by a single speaker.

 /LHban-on/        [mba.nn]     165               ‘jaw bone’      CompoundingThe data in this table show that in certain contexts the vowels in /LHmn/
‘string bag’ and /Hmn/ ‘child’ are very similar in length, namely 155 ms vs.
140 ms. The reason for this is that the tonal melody in /LHmn/ ‘string bag’
does not show up as a contour when material cliticizes to the noun. In larger
tonal domains the tonal melody is spread over the whole domain (see sections
2.8.3.1 and 2.8.3.2).
    Therefore, Fedden (2007a) analyses the longer vowel in the uncliticized
form /LHmn/ ‘string bag’ to be a phonetic effect of the contour tone rather
than to assume a length distinction or a syllabification into two syllables.
Since contour tones, as opposed to level tones, take a certain time to be
realized, the vowel under the tone is lengthened. Thus vowel length becomes a
function of the tone (Weidert 1981: 66-68).
    Compounding has a similar effect on tonal melodies and vowel length. The
LH melody in /LHban/ [mbán] ‘jaw’ does not show up as a contour in the
compound /LH|banon/ [mbann] ‘jaw bone’ due to the specific tone
association rules involved here (see 2.8.2.3 and 2.8.3.3). Consequently, the
vowel, i.e. the pharyngealized /a/, is shortened.
    The same holds for contexts in which tone is completely neutralized, i.e.
when the tone pattern on two words becomes the same due to cliticization of
the predicator or an article. In table 2.4, vowel length value is the middle out
of two tokens of each word uttered in isolation by a single speaker.
    Table 2.4 suggests that the (near-)minimal pairs /Lokok/ vs. /LHmokok/ and
/ aft/ vs. /LHaft/, at the phonemic level, do not contrast in length but in tone.
 LThis indicates that the difference in vowel length is functionally unimportant.
    The phonetic lengthening of vowels is only conspicuous under rising
contours, i.e. the LH melody. Monosyllabic words with a HL contour, on the
other hand, do not show phonetic lengthening under the contour tone HL, e.g.
/HLfab/ ‘where’ (125ms) and /HLf/ ‘carrion’ (155ms), each single tokens
recorded in isolation.

 / aft=o= b/       [a.f.t.]     90           ‘it’s (been) cleared of a taboo’Vowel length can be also systematically related to other phenomena apart
from pitch. The role of pitch in vowel length does not explain why the vowel
in /Hmn/ ‘child’ is considerably longer (185 ms) than the vowel in the second
syllable in /Lajal/ ‘light’ (125 ms), as both have level tones, a high and a low
one, respectively. Similarly, the length difference between /LHit/ ‘penis’ (260
ms) and /LHkwit/ ‘sugar cane’ (185 ms) cannot be due to tone because both
bear the same LH melody.
    Some of these differences in length might be accounted for by relating
them to straightforward differences in syllable configuration. Throughout the
language, vowels in monosyllables are longer than vowels in syllables of
disyllables. Similarly, vowels in onset-less or coda-less syllables are longer
than vowels in syllables which have onsets or codas. It seems however less
probable that the absence or the presence of an onset, as in the pair /LHit/
‘penis’ (260 ms) vs. /LHkwit/ ‘sugar cane’ (185 ms) can indeed account for a
difference in duration of over 70ms.
    The data and the discussion in this section might suggest there is evidence
for a phonemic length distinction in Mian vowels. However, a systematic
analysis of vowel length is impeded by the fact that there are no minimal
length pairs and not many near-minimal length pairs. What’s worse, vowel
length is generally subject to considerable variation between speakers (up to
60ms in some cases), and even between different tokens of the same word
uttered by a single speaker (again up to 60 ms in some cases). This range of
free length variation makes it hard to assign a given vowel to a discrete ‘long’
or ‘short’ phonemic category when genuine minimal pairs are absent, and
near-minimal pairs are rare. Furthermore, at this stage, the data available for
analysis are not sufficient to make any statistically valid generalizations about
vowel length. For that, more tokens and especially more different speakers
recording these tokens are needed.

one in Fedden (2007a) in not assuming a phonemic length contrast, leaving
the question whether Mian has a phonemic length distinction in its vowels for
future research on the language’s phonetics and phonology.","[58, 59, 60, 61]"

8.5.4.1. Classificatory prefixesA sizeable subset of the verbal vocabulary requires a classificatory prefix, e.g.
dob-ò/— ‘take (M-class object)’ or ol-ò/— ‘take (plural inanimate objects)’.
These classificatory prefixes are formally fully distinct from the object
prefixes used for the verbs, which indicate their object accusatively and the
classification system relevant for these prefixes cross-cuts the gender system.
Classificatory prefixes are dealt with in detail in chapter 5. Here, I confine
myself to providing two examples illustrating the absolutive nature of the
classificatory prefixes, i.e. the object of a transitive verb (67) or the subject of
an intransitive verb (68) are indexed:(67)     báangkli=e            dob-ò-n-o=a
         stone_adze=SG.N1 3SG.M_CL.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED

       ‘Dabein came falling down (i.e. from the sky) and ...’ [Sofelok, 1]
8.5.4.2. Stem apophony in perfective ‘cut and break’-verbsFive perfective-only ‘cut and break’-verbs indicate the number of the
(inanimate) object through stem apophony on an absolutive basis. The
alternation is always between /a/ for a singular object and // for a plural
object. All of these verbs are compounds consisting of one of the five ‘cut and
break’ verbs wà ‘cut’, dà ‘break off’, bà ‘cut across’, hà ‘cut alongside, break
apart’, or tà ‘cut off’, and a semantically more general verb, e.g. -lò ‘hit’ or
-tlâa’ ‘remove’, for example, wa-lò ‘cut (singular object)’ in (69) and we-lò
‘cut (plural object)’ in (70).(69)   db=e              wà-lò-n-i=be
       seed=SG.N1         cut.SG.O-hit.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I cut off a seed.’(70)   db=o              wè-lò-n-i=be
       seed=PL.N1         cut.PFV.PL.O-hit.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I cut off seeds.’The number of verbs which obligatorily agree with their object in number only
is quite small and semantically very homogeneous. Further examples are: halò
‘cut, break (singular wooden object)’ and helò ‘cut, break (plural wooden
object)’, batlâa’ ‘break, tear apart (vine, leaf, tree bark)’ and betlâa’ ‘break,
tear apart (plural vines, leaves, tree bark)’.
    If a verb which indicates the number of its object by stem apophony is
ambitransitive and the object of the transitively used verb becomes the subject
of the intransitively used verb, as in (71). Stem apophony reflects the number
of the subject.(71)   as=e            hà-lò-s-e=a
       tree=SG.N1      break.PFV.SG.SBJ-hit.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.N1.SBJ=MED
       ‘The tree broke (down) and then someone…’ [Flood]In this case, both stem apophony in the verb and the subject suffix indicate
properties of the subject. Number is expressed in the stem and person,
number, and gender are expressed in the subject suffix.
                                                      8.5. Argument marking    2698.5.5.    Object suffix (indirective alignment)Recipients are marked on the ditransitive verbs -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ and -ka-
‘give (IPFV)’ with a suffix. Both belong to the class of verbs which
obligatorily cross-reference and classify the theme object, i.e. the gift, with a
classificatory prefix. In addition, they also take a suffix that cross-references
the recipient (plus another suffix for the subject). While many Papuan
languages display secundative alignment for the recipient in ditransitives, they
treat the recipient like the object of a monotransitive verb, the alignment for
the recipient argument in Mian is indirective, i.e. recipients are marked
different from objects of monotransitive verbs.
    Thus, -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ and -ka- ‘give (IPFV)’ are examples of triple
agreement, i.e. the indexing of subject and two objects by affixes on the verb.
Triple agreement is a typologically rare phenomenon, both in Papuan
languages and world-wide .
    An example of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is provided in (72):(72)     n      naka=e          éil=o
         1SG     man=SG.M        pig=SG.F         om-ûb’-a-Ø-i-bio=be
         3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=DECL
         ‘I gave the sow to the man.’As in transitive clauses, none of the overt arguments n ‘I’, naka=e ‘the man’,
or éil=o ‘the sow’ in this example are marked for their syntactic role within
the clause. Construal of grammatical roles proceeds by aligning the overt noun
phrases with the agreeing pronominal affixes on the verb. In this case, n ‘I’ is
the subject because -i ‘first person singular subject’ is in the subject slot of the
verb, and the noun phrases naka=e ‘the man’ and éil=o ‘the sow’ appear in a
double object construction. Each object is indexed in a different way on the
verb, naka=e ‘the man’ as the recipient object and éil=o ‘the sow’ as the
theme object.
   Like subject marking, recipient marking is suffixal and it is likewise
obligatory. Unlike subject and object marking, however, recipient marking is
sensitive to whether the marking suffix occurs in imperfective or perfective
verb forms (see below). The set of recipient suffixes occurring with -ûb’-
‘give (PFV)’ is summarized in table 8.4. Grey areas indicate the neutralization
of a gender contrast. For ease of exposition, only the ûb-paradigm, i.e. the
suffixes following -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’, is given here. Further below these forms
are contrasted with the forms from the ka-paradigm, used in the imperfective.
Recipient arguments of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ are always animate.

         ‘They habitually give (a few) vomit bags to us (i.e. on the
         mission plane).’The set of recipient cross-referencing suffixes for -ka- ‘give (IPFV)’ is
summarized in table 8.5. For ease of comparison, I repeat the recipient forms
in the perfective in this table. Both series have the typical TNG reflexes /n/
and /k/ the first and second singular forms (Foley 2000: 362, Ross 2005: 32).
Grey areas indicate the neutralization of a gender contrast. Recipient
arguments of -ka- ‘give (IPFV)’ and of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ are always animate.
    The imperfective root /ka/ might have some historical relation to the proto-
Engan (TNG) verbal beneficiary suffix *-ka. This form could be cognate with
the third person recipient stem kálaa ‘give to him/her/them’ in Kewa (Franklin
1971: 66) and has possible reflexes in other TNG ‘give’ verbs (Reesink, in
prep.).

While perfective -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is an underived ditransitive verb in
contemporary Mian and obligatorily index both theme and recipient, -ka-
‘give (IPFV)’ is apparently derived from the transitive verb -ka ‘put’, which
only indexes the object with a classificatory prefix but does not have a
recipient suffix:(75)     imen=e           ob-ka-bina-b-i=be

         ‘I (habitually) put down a taro.’It is my conjecture that historically imperfective -ka- ‘give (IPFV)’ was derived
from -ka ‘put (IPFV)’ in lieu of an imperfective stem for the defective verb -
ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’.","[293, 294, 295, 296, 297]"
"
2.8.6.      High tone on the stem of the verb ge/gen ‘build, roll, fasten’Among the N-stems (see 8.4) there is one notable exception where tone is
employed to disambiguate segmentally identical forms. For the verb ge/gen
‘build, roll, fasten’, realis and inchoative forms are segmentally identical. To
mark a form as inchoative, the H-toned inchoative stem gn is used. Compare
(131) and (132):(131) am=o          ge-n-e=be

2.8.7.      The LH melody in lexical reduplicationsMany lexical reduplications have an LH melody so that the first syllable is
low and the second is high. In the orthography the melody is indicated
phonetically. Some examples are: gwekgwk ‘Spot-winged Monarch (sc.
Monarcha guttula)’, gwalgwl ‘twins’, kimkm ‘root’, meimi ‘earthquake’,
glagl ‘between’.

assigned H or HL from any of the tonal melodies H, HL, or LHL are more
prominent than syllables which are assigned L. The phonetic manifestations
are that they are longer and have high or falling pitch, e.g.:(133) /Hsku/           [s k]                ‘bush knife’
      /LHLwalonamabib/ [walnmai]           ‘I will buy’
      /LHLmi|nin/       [minìn]                  ‘meet, gather’Words with L tone are pronounced with no conspicuous change in pitch or
vowel length, e.g.:(134) /Libal/             [ial]           ‘dust’
      /Lfubinibiob/      [fuiniio]    ‘I was cooking’
2.9.     OrthographyApart from a few exceptions, I adopt the practical orthography developed for
Mian by Smith and Weston (1974a: 29-30). During my time in the field, I
found the SIL orthography to be highly practical and therefore not be changed
lightly. The following list, which outlines the spelling conventions adopted in
this grammar, deviates only in the orthographic representation of /l/, for which
I will use phonetic spelling, namely d word-initial and syllable-initial after
consonant, and l elsewhere. This change seems to be in accord with the
orthography used in the Mian dictionary compiled by Smith and Weston
(n.d.-b), where word-initial /l/ in native Mian words is consistently spelled d.(135) /b/      b

       /ou/    ouMy analysis of Mian phonology – both segmental and suprasegmental –
makes a few changes of the practical orthography necessary, purely for
academic purposes, that is. All adjustments will be justified below.
    First, the pharyngealized /a/ is spelled <aa> in opposition to <a>. Since it
is a distinct phoneme, I also indicate this in the spelling. Smith and Weston
use orthographic <aa> in some of the words which have a pharyngealized /a/,
others being non-pharyngealized instances of an ‘a’ which they analyse as
long.
    Second, as I do not analyse vowel length to be phonemic in Mian,
geminate vowels are eliminated from the orthography, e.g. mèén ‘string bag’
in Smith and Weston’s orthography is spelled mén in this grammar.
    Third, phonemic tone is incorporated into the orthography. Only H, LH,
HL, and LHL are written. Example are given for mono- and a disyllabic
words:(136) L         am ‘house’, ibal ‘dust’
      H         n ‘arrow’, sku ‘bush knife’
      LH        mín ‘son’, ninín ‘name’
      HL        fè ‘carrion’, usàn ‘tail’
      LHL       klâ ‘properly’, ibâl ‘paper wasp’The tonal melody for which a word is specified is marked over the accented
syllable, e.g. káawa ‘steel axe’ or -fâ ‘put (PFV)’, or in the case of H on the
first syllable of the word. Off-stem accented verbs are marked with an
apostrophe following the stem to indicate that in inflected forms the tonal
melody is associated with the syllable immediately to the right of the stem. If
the stem occurs on its own, the tonal melody of off-stem accented verbs is
realized on the final stem syllable in lieu of a suffixal syllable following the
stem.
Chapter 3
Word classes and grammatical relations
3.0.     IntroductionNouns, adjectives, and verbs constitute open word classes. While the classes
of nouns and adjectives readily accept loans from Tok Pisin or English, verbal
loans from Tok Pisin or English cannot be inflected like native Mian verbs,
but rather such loans have to be followed by the function verb ke ‘do’ in a
function verb construction. Mian is typically Papuan in that it makes a very
clear formal distinction between nouns and verbs (Himmelmann 2005: 126-
131).
   All other word classes are closed, and with the exception of verbs rather
small. The closed word classes comprise the following parts of speech:   Articles
   Prenominal modifiers
   Adverbs
   Pronouns
   Directionals
   Postpositions
   Quantifiers
   Conjunctions
   Ideophones
   ParticlesIn order to determine the defining features of a given word class, a
combination of morphosyntactic and distributional criteria will be employed.","[108, 109, 110, 111]"

9.2.2.    Transitives with object prefix (accusative alignment)Subclass 2 of transitive verbs contains those with an obligatory object prefix
which signals person, number, and (in the third person) the gender of the
object. These verb stems are given in (21). The formal details of pronominal
object prefixes are covered in section 8.5.5.(21)     -e          ‘hit, kill (IPFV)’
         -fû’        ‘grab (PFV)’
         -lò         ‘hit, kill (PFV)’
         -nâ’        ‘hit, kill (PFV)’
         -ntamâ’     ‘bite (PFV)’
         -têm’       ‘see (PFV)’
         -temê’      ‘look at (IPFV)’This type of argument marking shows accusative alignment. The subjects of
intransitive verbs (S) and transitive verbs (A) are treated in the same way,
different from the object of transitive verbs (O). The accusative alignment
pattern is illustrated by comparing an intransitive verb (22) with a transitive
verb (23):(22)     yle    on-s-io=be
         well    go.PFV-RPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL

342      9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseIn (23) above, the object is marked on the verb with the pronominal affix a-
‘third person singular masculine’. The overt object noun phrase can be elided
without affecting the grammaticality of the utterance, as in (24):(24)     a-nâ’-s-ib=e?
         3SG.M.O-kill.PFV-RPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=Q
         ‘Well, did they kill him?’
9.2.3.     Transitives with object suffix (indirective aligment)Subclass 3 of transitive verbs consists of verbs which index their object with a
pronominal object suffix. In the perfective, such objects can only be
introduced into the argument structure of a verb through a compound with
-ûb- ‘give (PFV)’, to which the object suffix is appended. In the imperfective,
object suffixes directly attach to the stem (see section 8.5.5). If a verb
obligatorily has an object suffix, this is indicated by a dash following the stem,
e.g. fote- ‘chase away, rout’ (25) or dei-/— ‘leave’ (26).(25)     y         Klefol=i         tata      ke-n-ib=a

                                                           9.2. Transitives   343As verbs of this type always need -ûb- ‘give (PFV)’ with an applicative
function in the perfective, they look derived. However, they – at least
synchronically – do not have an intransitive base from which they could be
derived, i.e. there is no verb *fote, cf. example (25).
    All verb stems that belong to subclass 3 of transitive verbs are given in the
list below:(27)   al tlia-   ‘be angry (PFV)’
       atli-      ‘be angry (IPFV)’
       da-        ‘help’

       men-       ‘touch, feel (IPFV)’
       wai-       ‘wait for (PFV)’The verbs en- ‘pain’ and go- ‘like, appreciate’ are exceptional in that they do
not require object suffixes to be present in the verbal noun. For these two
verbs two forms exist, one with and one without object suffix. Thus, en- has
the verbal nouns (28) and (29):(28)   en-ye-m-in

         ‘(instance of) routing us/you/them’One perception verb and some verbs denoting physiological or psychological
states belong to the subclass of transitive verbs which obligatorily index their
object (i.e. the experiencer) with a suffix. Example (33) shows the use of the
perception verb mele-/men- ‘touch, feel’. Example (34) illustrates —/en- ‘hurt,

9.2.4.     Transitives without object affixAlthough the transitive verbs of subclass 4 never cross-reference their object
they nonetheless have objects. For a more detailed treatment of this issue, see
3.14.2 on the grammatical relation of object in Mian.
   Compare (35) with an overt object noun phrase and (36) without one:(35)     imen=o          wen-b-i=be
         taro=N1.PL      eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
         ‘I am eating taro.’(36)     wen-b-i=be
         eat.IPFV-IPFV-1.SG.SBJ=DECL
         ‘I am eating (it).’
                                                             9.2. Transitives   345The existence of these verbs shows that Mian is not fully head-marking at the
clause level. For these verbs, there is neither head-marking nor dependent-
marking.
    As with the other three types of transitive verb, the object noun phrase of
transitive verbs in the fourth subclass tends to be elided if referent identity is
recoverable from context or speech situation or if its identity is irrelevant. The
normal situation for any transitive verb is to occur without overt object noun
phrases in Mian discourse.
    Hence, transitives without cross-referencing object affixes might seem
difficult to separate from intransitive verbs in many instances. However, there
is both a syntactic and a semantic criterion which can be used to distinguish
the two from each other.
    Syntactically, transitives without cross-referencing object affixes differ
from intransitives in that they are always capable of having an overt object
noun phrase, which is still understood in case it is dropped. Intransitives can
under no circumstances have overt objects nor do they have elided but
understood objects.
    Semantically, the predications made by transitives without cross-
referencing object affixes can be characterized as involving a participant – in
addition to the participant encoded as subject – which undergoes or is affected
by (or effected/produced by) the action described by the verb. Even though
they might show up without an overt object noun phrase in discourse,
semantically they invariably describe two-place relations.
    An alternative analysis would be to treat transitives without cross-
referencing object affixes as ambitransitives, i.e. verbs which can be used
either transitively or intransitively without any overt derivation. Two types of
ambitransitives are normally distinguished in the literature. The decisive
question is “which of the transitive arguments corresponds to the intransitive
argument (Dixon 1994: 18). In the first type, intransitive S becomes transitive
A, as in ‘I am eating’ vs. ‘I am eating an apple’. In the second type,
intransitive S becomes transitive O, as in ‘the door opened’ vs. ‘I opened the
door’. Following Dixon (2002: 177), I will call these two types of
ambitransitives the “S=A type” and the “S=O type”.
    The alternation illustrated in (35) and (36) could thus be due to the fact that
the verb dowôn’/wen ‘eat’ is an S=A ambitransitive in Mian. However, I have
no evidence whatsoever suggesting (36) illustrates a change in argument
structure, in other words, that the verb becomes intransitive just because the
overt object noun phrase is elided. Therefore, I will reject the S=A
ambitransitive analysis here and recognize a fourth subclass of transitive verbs
whose objects are never indexed but can be freely elided without a change in
argument structure.
346    9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause    Most transitive verbs which do not index their object occur with inanimate
objects only. Few can have animate objects, e.g. bina/— ‘shoot, pierce’, or
must have animate objects, e.g. bu ‘hunt’ and yo ‘initiate, beget’.
    Other transitive verbs of subclass 4 are: baa/o ‘say’, bafu ‘boil’, bali ‘to
bear (fruit)’, bina/— ‘shoot, pierce’, bu ‘hunt’, dabala/daba ‘make (arrow)’,
fa/faka ‘make (a fire)’, fu ‘cook, smoke’, fubâ ‘wash’, ga ‘cook in a leaf
oven’, ge/gen ‘build, roll, fasten’, gò’/gokà ‘cut (flesh, meat)’, haa ‘weave
(string bag)’, habù ‘obscure, hide’, hena/hen ‘seek’, kimâa’/— ‘look out for,
guard’, klâ ‘fix, complete’, klutâ/klutâ(ka) ‘smash’, maanafa/— ‘cut (cooked
meat)’, ngana/ngaan ‘sing’, nini ‘scrape (taro)’, ou ‘put (arrow head) into
shaft’, sita ‘care for’, ta ‘sharpen’, taye ‘crack open (nut)’, tosiana/tosian
‘fear’, wa ‘adorn with carvings’, went/wentê ‘hear, understand’, yo ‘initiate,
beget’.","[367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372]"

3.7.12.   Note on indefinitesThere is no separate set of indefinite pronouns. Instead the adjective mak
‘other, some’ is used as a nominal modifier to express indefinite notions, for
example:(142) naka mak
      man some
      ‘some man, somebody (M)’(143) unáng    mak
      woman    some
      ‘some woman, somebody (F)’(144) am     mak      dim=o
      day    some     on=N2
      ‘on some day, sometimes, sometime’
140    3. Word classes and grammatical relations3.8.      DirectionalsDirectionals are an important and very variable category in Mian. They can be
used as adverbs or postpositions and be directly inflected to form verbs of
motion.
   All directionals primarily have spatial meaning and denote locations or
directions. They can never be combined. The inventory consists of six items:(145) ut~wit       ‘up(wards)’
      daak         ‘down(wards)’
      met          ‘upriver, up a little’
      tab          ‘downriver, down a little’
      wt          ‘across (a river or valley)’
      tm          ‘sideways, to the side (on same level)’Mian directionals are intimately linked to the topographical environment in
which the speakers of the language live. Figure 3.1 illustrates the basic
meanings of the directionals in relation to the topographical environment.                                 ut
                                                                  met

                                                                wt
         RIVER
Figure 3.1. Mian directionals and the topographic environment
                                                           3.8. Directionals   141The two main axes of orientation are (a) ground elevation, i.e. ut ‘up’ vs. daak
‘down’ and (b) the rivers Hak and Sek, which run roughly parallel to each
other near Mianmin, i.e. met ‘upriver’ vs. tab ‘downriver’.
    Directionals are also employed in small(er)-scale environments, in which
the directionals met ‘upriver’ and tab ‘downriver’ are not used with reference
to a river as a landmark but rather mean ‘up (a little)’ and ‘down (a little)’,
respectively.
    Locations around the upper part of the human body are commonly referred
to as ut, e.g. kwel ut [neck up] ‘up at the neck’, and locations around the lower
part as tab, e.g. kakam tab [buttocks down] ‘down at the buttocks’. However,
more systematic research in spatial deixis is needed for reliable
generalizations about the use of directionals in small-scale reference frames.
    Directionals are used for all locations inside and outside of the Mianmin
area. Selected example are: ut - Sokamin; daak - Oksapmin, Tabubil, Fiak,
Lae, and Germany; met - Tifalmin; tab - Gubil, Yapsiei, Hotmin, Green River;
tm - Ogisai; wt - Telefomin, Vanimo, Aitape, Port Moresby, and Australia.
Farther away locations show inter-speaker variation, for instance, one only
finds tab for Gubil, which is a six-hour walk downriver from Mianmin,
whereas the location of Germany or Australia are referred to by either daak or
wt.
    Directionals can be used as postpositions and adverbially. As postpositions
they follow a noun phrase. See also 7.1. They typically cliticize to their noun
host:(146) Skiobib tab
      PN       downriver
      ‘downriver in Skiobib’ [Dimosson]They can be marked with an article which agrees in number and gender with
its nomnial complement. In such a configuration, the postposition does not
cliticize, e.g.:(147) kwel       ut=o
      neck(F) up=SG.F
      ‘up at her neck’ [Selimin]In their adverbial use, directionals indicate that a movement event specified by
a verb of motion takes place in a certain direction. In this case, the directional
comes immediately before the verb:

      ‘The Telefomin people came down and then …’ [Mianmin and
      Telefomin]Furthermore, all directionals can be inflected directly to form intransitive
verbs of motion. For details on this special type of inflection, see 9.1.2 on
motion verbs.","[165, 166, 167, 168]"
"
3.1.1.      Properties common to all nounsSuprasegmentally, all nouns are lexically specified for one out of five tonal
melodies (i.e. L, H, LH, LHL, and HL), whose domain is the prosodic word as
a whole. Nouns with a complex tonal melody (i.e. LH, LHL, and HL) also
have one accent which is the association point for the tonal melody.
    Nominal morphology is essentially non-existent, the only suffix being the
pluralizer -wal, which is restricted to proper names and kin nouns (see 3.1.7),
and dyads (see 3.1.8).
    Nouns do not mark number. The only exceptions are two irregular plural
stems: (i) mn ‘child’ vs. memé ‘children’ and (ii) the bound noun stems -sak
‘resident of’ vs. -sel ‘residents of’, which only occur as second members in
compounds. Number distinctions (singular vs. plural) in noun phrases are
marked on the article (see 3.3 below), the demonstrative, on other adnominal
determiners and also show up on pronominal affixes on the verb.
    Most nouns are assigned to one of four genders: Masculine (M), feminine
(F), neuter 1 (N1), and neuter 2 (N2). Some nouns undergo cross-classification
and can appear with the agreement patterns of several genders (mostly either
masculine or feminine), depending on salient semantic features of the referent.
Gender is not marked overtly on the noun itself. Agreement targets for gender
are all determiners and the verbal pronominal affixes (On gender, see chapter
4).
    Case is not marked morphologically on nouns, nor by adpositions. Rather,
verbal affixes indicate grammatical relations in a clause.
    Most nouns do not reduplicate productively (but see dyads below). There
are some lexicalized noun reduplications, such as bokoubokou ‘Stephanie’s
astrapia (sc. Astrapia stephaniae)’, sokousokôu ‘insect sp.’, dingding ‘taro
rhizome’, afilfil ‘twins’, kimkm ‘root’, kubkub ‘down (of a bird)’, or skosk
‘knot in wood’. At least synchronically, all of these lack non-reduplicated
counterparts (with the possible exception of kim ‘ground’). This is typical of
Ok languages in general (Healey 1964a: 64).
    Nouns function as heads of noun phrases. They can be preceded by a
possessor or a prenominal (embedded) relative clause and followed by
adjectival modifiers, or a numeral. The rightmost position in any noun phrase
is occupied by a pronominal element from one of the pronoun series or a clitic
pronominal article. These pronominal elements indicate number, gender, and
referentiality of the noun. Cliticized article and noun form one phonological
                                                                 3.1. Nouns   87word for the purpose of tone assignment. On the syntactic structure of the
noun phrase, see chapter 6.
    Within the clause, noun phrases function as overt core arguments and
possessors. Apart from these core functions, nouns can be locative adjuncts of
intransitive verbs of motion. Noun phrases can function as the predicate in
non-verbal clauses (see 9.11).","[112, 113]"
"
4.1.      Agreement on the articleFor the description of the Mian gender system I will confine myself to one
agreement target, namely the article (see 3.3). This is not problematic because
the agreement markers on the other agreement targets besides the article show
the same patterns. The agreement patterns for determiners and pronominal
affixes on the verb are given in section 4.5 in this chapter.
    In the course of this chapter the reader will notice that there is considerable
homophony in the agreement markers. This suggests an alternative analysis
which recognizes only two genders in Mian. This issue will be taken up
below.
170    4. Gender   All instances of gender agreement in Mian are ‘mechanical’ in nature, i.e.
gender is fixed for most nouns and the formatives on the agreement targets are
predictable from the gender of the noun. The possibilities for agreement
according to semantic gender are limited to nouns referring to human beings
and higher animals (e.g. friend, orphan, pig, dog, etc.) for which differences in
sex are either obvious or important. When the referent of such a double-
gender noun changes, e.g. from a male to a female in a given context, the
gender will change, and concomitantly the agreement patterns.
   Nouns used referentially are followed by an article which is segmentally
identical to the free pronouns and which cliticizes to the noun (see 3.4). Free
pronoun forms all have high tone:  ‘he’,  ‘she’ and  ‘they’. Articles are in
the process of losing their tone. While most articles are toneless, one
occasionally encounters articles with inherent high tone in Mian discourse.
For ease of exposition, I assume in this grammar that articles are inherently
unspecified for tone. Example (1) illustrates nouns in subject and object
position. Example (2) shows the use of a noun as a possessive modifier.
Possession in Mian is not marked morphologically but is syntactically
determined. The possessor precedes the possessed.(1)    naka=e          éil=o         kan

       man=SG.M pig=SG.F
       ‘the man’s sow’Mian has three formally distinct (usually) toneless clitic articles =e, =o, and
=i, which pattern as follows:      (a)    naka=e      ‘a/the man’       naka=i  ‘(the) men’
      (b)    unáng=o     ‘a/the woman’     unáng=i ‘(the) women’

      (d)    am=o        ‘a/the house’     am=o    ‘(the) houses’Following Corbett (1991), who defines genders as congruence classes of
singular-plural pairs formally delineated by sets of agreement markers, I set up
four (controller) genders. The sets of agreement markers defining these
genders are given in brackets:

-      Neuter 1     (=e, =o) e.g. imen    ‘taro’
-      Neuter 2     (=o, =o) e.g. am      ‘house’
4.2.       Gender assignmentThe masculine and feminine genders are semantically homogeneous classes,
in that they only include animates of male and female sex, respectively (with
the exception of conventionalized gender where gender assignment can
actually be at variance with biological sex).
    Neuter 1 is semantically quite homogeneous as well and comprises count
nouns with inanimate referents. For the masculine, feminine and neuter 1
genders, a contrast in number can be encoded. Neuter 2 is semantically more
heterogeneous and there is no number contrast. Gender assignment criteria are
summarized in table 4.1 below.","[195, 196, 197]"

with bare fàb is never marked with the interrogative clitic =e:

             ‘Where?’        ‘He’s over there.’The interrogative word fàb ‘where’ can occur with intransitive predicates of
location or movement, such as the existential verb n/bi~bl in (22) or
un~on/unê ‘go’ in (23):(22)   fàb       bi-Ø-o=ne?

       ‘Where did you do (it)?’Fàb can be used adnominally as an interrogative modifier as well. In its
adnominal use, it follows the noun with which it forms the interrogative
phrase and means ‘which’ rather than ‘where’, e.g.:(26)   am=o         fàb       áa un-omab-bio=ne?
       house=N2     which lie go.PFV-IRR.PL.AN.SBJ-1PL.SBJ=CQ
       ‘To which house will we sleep?’ [Danenok]
394       10. Question formation10.2.3.     fatnà- ‘do what?’This is an interrogative pro-verb (Hagège 2008) consisting of the interrogative
word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’. Fatnà ‘do what?’ can be inflected as a
verb and has the meaning ‘do what’:(27)      fatnà-b-eb=e?
          do_what-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=CQ
          ‘What are you doing?’ [Observed]There is a case to be made that fatnà is best analysed as an interrogative pro-
verb, i.e. as a single root which contains both a verbal and an interrogative
meaning. Such interrogative pro-verbs can be found in Papuan languages, e.g.
Kuot (Lindström 2002), Austronesian languages, e.g. Paamese (Crowley
1982) and Australian languages, e.g. Kayardild (Evans 1995: 371-372) and
Dyirbal (Dixon 1972). Outside the Pacific area, interrogative verbs can for
example be found in West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut) (Sadock 1984: 206).
   In Paamese, there is an intransitive monomorphemic interrogative verb
kosaa ‘do what’, which is not segmentable into an interrogative and a verbal
element (Crowley 1982: 159).
   For Kayardild, Evans (1995: 371) analyses the pro-verb ngaakawatha ‘do
what’ as an inchoative form of the interrogative word ngaaka ‘what/who’.
Here, the pro-verb is derived from an interrogative word with the suffix
-watha which derives verbs from nominals (Evans 1995: 282).
   The degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal element in
fatnà is relatively low. The interrogative word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’
can still clearly be discerned. /b/ goes to [t] before the alveolar nasal /n/. This
form of place assimilation applies across the board in Mian and is thus not
necessarily indicative of a beginning fusion between the interrogative and the
verb stem.
   On the other hand, there is a semantic shift of the interrogative word fàb
from ‘where’ to ‘what’ in fatnà. Bare fàb cannot mean ‘what’, while fatnà
cannot mean ‘do where’. It contrasts with fàb na ‘do where’. As the meaning
of fàb is clearly construction-specific here, the meaning of fatnà cannot be
said to be fully transparent anymore. Also, the [t] in the interrogative verb
ftna is often elided in normal and fast speech to yield fanà ‘do what’. I
therefore analyse fatnà as an interrogative pro-verb, albeit one with a low
degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal part.
   The core meaning of fatnà is ‘do what’:(28)      n      ul        lo                 dowôn’-aam-i=o

        ‘If I eat this fungus, what will happen to me?’ [TMA Questionnaire,

is closer to ‘why’, as in (29) or ‘how’, as in (30):(29)                  fanà-n-o=ta

       do_what=MED          go.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=CQ
       ‘How has he escaped me?’ [Klebein]
       (lit. ‘What has he done, has he gone on me?’)The last two examples also shed some light on the syntactic and
morphological behaviour of fatnà in content questions.
   First, these forms function as verbs and are heads of their own clauses as
can be seen in (29), which consists of a medial clause  fatnànota and a final
clause besao mebone. This is captured in the literal translations above. Like
medial verbs, inflected fatnà is subject to the usual inflectional restrictions for
medial verbs, namely that they cannot be marked for polarity or for irrealis or
deontic mood.
   Second, the bare stem fatnà can appear in shortened medial clauses under
subject identity as in (30). If the verb in the following clause has the same
subject, Mian medial verbs can be shortened to just the stem which is marked
as a medial verb by the clitic =ta (see 11.2.13).
   Therefore, fatnà ‘do what’ is a morphologically and syntactically regular
verb in many respects. It can also form hortative verb forms (31) and appear in
purposive serializations (32):(31)    fatnà-n-an=e?

          ‘You go to do what?’
10.2.4.     The verbal noun fatnàmin ‘what’The interrogative word fatnàmin has the basic meaning ‘what’. As an isolated
utterance, fatnàmin is interpreted as ‘what’, ‘why’, or ‘how’. Unlike a
question with bare fàb, a question with fatnàmin can optionally be marked
with the content question clitic =e:(33)      fatnàmin?/ fatnàmin=e?    ‘What (is it)?’/‘Why (is it)?’/‘How (is it)?’If fatnàmin appears in an argument position of a verb, as in (34), i.e. in the
position the argument constituent will have in an appropriate answer sentence,
as in (35), it means ‘what’:(34)      Q:    kbo      fatnàmin dowôn’-aamab-eb=e?
                2SG.M     what        eat.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=CQ

                ‘I want to eat pork.’As no interrogative containing fàb can ever be used to inquire about animates,
the argument position fatnàmin occupies is usually that of the object of the
verb.
   Inanimate subjects of the (intransitive) existential verb n/bi~bl, can be
queried by using fatnàmin:(36)      Q:    fatnàmin y      bi-Ø-e=ne?
                what       there stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=CQ

                 taro=SG.N1        there stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=DECL
                 ‘There is a taro (tuber).’In its adnominal use fatnàmin precedes the noun phrase and means either
‘what kind of’ or ‘how many’. Thus, the questions in (38) and (39) below are
                                                      10.2. Content questions     397ambiguous as to whether the speaker requests information about quality, i.e.
‘what kind of’, or quantity, i.e. ‘how many’. Generally, the context has to
disambiguate:(38)      fatnàmin lais         sm bi-Ø-e=ne?
          what     rice(TP) still stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=CQ
          ‘How much rice is still there?’ But also: ‘What kind of rice is still

          ‘What kind of house did he build?’ But also: ‘How many houses did
          he build?’In order to unambiguously express that they are interested to learn about
quantity and not quality or kind, younger speakers tend to use fatnàmin-fela
for ‘how much/many’. This construction is calqued from Tok Pisin hamaspela
‘how much/many’:(40)      fatnàmin-fela    tablaséb  unáng=i                wat

          ‘How many white women are over there?’ [Observed]Inquiring about quantities was presumably not a common activity in a society
which only had three basic numerals and by combining them counted to
around six or seven. Larger quantities were designated as ‘many’. I assume
that the meaning ‘how many’ for fatnàmin developed as a secondary sense
from ‘what, what kind of’.","[418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423]"

8.5.5.4. Semantic spectrum of the suffixed objectFor the basic ditransitives -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’, -ka- ‘give (IPFV)’, and -Ø - ‘give
(PFV)’, the role mapped onto the object suffix is always an (animate) recipient.
However, where ‘give’ is used in the perfective to derive an argument
structure that includes a recipient and in directly inflected forms in the
imperfective, the range of possible roles is much larger. Apart from recipients,
e.g. in ‘send to’ or ‘show to’, one also finds:

-   Goal of verbs of ballistic motion (e.g. ‘throw to’)
-   Malefactive source (e.g. ‘steal from’)
-   Experiencer (e.g. ‘tastes sour to me’)
-   Possessor (e.g. ‘hear my words’)A very common semantic role for the object suffix is a benefactive, as in
example (97) and (98):(97)   imen=o          fu-ke-b-i=be
       taro=PL.N1      cook-2SG.R-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL

       ‘Theyl killed another pig for themk, and then theyk ...’ [Mianmin
       and Telefomin history]Depending on the semantic-pragmatic context, a malefactive interpretation
may also be possible, so the sentence in (98) could also mean ‘They killed
another one of their pigs (i.e. against their will)’. Examples of a malefactive
whose interpretation as such is not dependent on context are given in (99) and
(100):(99)   Miantén          awél=i           y

       ‘They used to use poison on people.’ [Dafinau]
280    8. Verb morphologyIt is common for the roles of possessor and benefactive/malefactive to be
mapped onto the same argument of the verb, as in the following example:(101) ulêta            kwéit
      who.SG.M         sugar_cane        hal-ût’-ne-n-e-bu=e?
        break_off.PFV.SG.O-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ-GPST=CQ
        ‘Who broke off (some of) my sugar cane?’ [Unangkliten story]A clearer example of a possessor marked with a suffix on the verb -ûb’-
‘give’, which in turn is compounded with another verb, follows suit.
Possession can be indicated with an object suffix and a optional possessive
pronoun, as in (102):(102) (n)                     wéng=o
      (1SG.POSS)               talk=N2        went-ût’-ne-n-al=e!
        hear.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-2SG.SBJ.HORT=HORT
        ‘(You should) Mark my words!’While recipients and benefactives/malefactives are obligatorily marked on the
verb with a suffix, possessor raising is optional. It is also possible to just have
a possessive pronoun (without the object suffix cross-referencing the
possessor):(103) n            wéng=o    wentê-n-al=e!
      1SG.POSS      talk=N2   hear.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ.HORT=HORT
      ‘(You should) mark my words!’The malefactive source is a role associated with verbs like ‘take from, steal’.
The predicate in the following example (104) is not strictly a mono-lexemic
trivalent verb but a serial verb construction in which the subject is only
marked on the final verb:(104)              ayók        ol-ei-ˆt’-ne
      3PL.AN        secretly    PL.RESID.O-take.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R        un-Ø-io=be

                                                  8.5. Argument marking   281For verbs of ballistic motion, the goal can be encoded with an object suffix.
An example is provided for -bià ‘throw (PFV)’:(105) memâlo       naka=e            aful=e
      now          man=SG.M          ball=SG.N1       ob-ò-n-e=a                                         unáng=o

       3SG.RESID.O-throw.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.F.R-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘Now the man takes the ball and throws it to the woman, and
       then...’ [Ö. Dahl’s questionnaire, B8 (Dahl 1985)]The interpretation of an entity as a goal (in this example unáng ‘woman’)
towards which an event is directed is only possible with verbs of ballistic
motion, not with motion verbs in general, thus:(106) un-ûb’-ke-n-amab-i=be
      go.PFV-give.PFV-2SG.R-AUX.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
      ‘I will go for you.’
      BUT *‘I’ll go to you.’Here, the suffix -ke can only be interpreted as a benefactive, or possibly
malefactive (e.g. ‘go against your will’), but not as a goal.
   The only other role that can be mapped on the suffix is that of the
experiencer in verbs denoting physiological or psychological states, as in
(107) and (108):(107) al=o             y
      intestines=N2    there       tlia-ûb’-e-n-o=ta

       ‘they were angry (there) and then…’ (lit. ‘their intestines were

      2SG.M.POSS    head=SG.N1        pain.IPFV-2SG.R-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=Q
      ‘Does your head pain?’
282    8. Verb morphology8.5.5.5. Verbs with obligatory object suffixThe following verbs are all transitive and require their object to be expressed
with a suffix:(109) al tlia-    ‘be angry (PFV)’
      ale-        ‘show to’
      atli-       ‘be angry (IPFV)’
      da-         ‘help’
      doko-       ‘forget (PFV)’

      mele-       ‘touch (PFV)’
      wai-        ‘wait for (PFV)’
8.5.5.6. Verbs which never have an object suffixIn Mian object suffixes are a highly productive means of introducing an
additional participant into the argument structure of the verb. However, there
are a few verbs which do not allow derivation in this manner, such as:(110) be          ‘be walking, keep V-ing (IPFV)’
      ei          ‘fly (IPFV)’
      dama        ‘grow up (PFV)’
      gen         ‘be sick (IPFV)’
      klen        ‘crackle (IPFV)’
      un          ‘hum, drone (IPFV)’
      sasan       ‘moan (IPFV)’To this list are added some (complex) verbs referring to bodily processes, e.g.
kusang ge/kusang ga ‘sneeze’, usáan fu ‘vomit’.","[304, 305, 306, 307, 308]"

3.1.8.    DyadsDyadic terms (Evans 2003a, 2006) refer to a social or a kin relationship
between two or more people and encode relational opposites. There is some
marginal metaphorical extension to relations between inanimates. Mian has
five dyadic lexemes, which are given in (20):(20)     dum      ‘father and child (of either sex)’
         hat      ‘mother and child (of either sex)’
         mikim    ‘siblings of opposite sex’
         dab      ‘siblings of same sex’
         kam      ‘(married) couple’
96     3. Word classes and grammatical relationsFormally, dyadic terms are closest to nouns. They can appear as arguments of
a verb and they appear with an article, which is preferably the collective
article =o, but =i ‘animate plural’ is also possible:(21)                      hat=o
        3PL.AN.POSS        mother_child(dyad)=COLL        un-Ø-ib-bio=be
        go.PFV-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ-GPST=DECL
        ‘They, mother and child, went away.’However, dyads are distinct from common nouns in the following ways.
Dyads cannot be turned into a verb using the verbalizer -an. Compare (22) and
(23):(22)    gwán-an-Ø-e=be
        spider-VBLZ-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He became a spider.’(23)    *dab-an-Ø-ibo=be
        same_sex_siblings(dyad)-VBLZ-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        Intended: ‘they became brothers/sisters’Furthermore, nouns generally do not occur with the collective article =o, with
the notable exception of kin nouns. Finally, the semantics of dyads and nouns
are different since dyads refer to relations rather than entities.
    If the dyad refers to a relation between just two individuals, it can be
inflected for plural with the plural suffix -wal:(24)    Danenok    dab-wal=i
        PN         same_sex_sibling(dyad)-PL=PL.AN
        ‘Danenok and his brother’ [Danenok]The form dab=i [same_sex_sibling(dyad)=PL.AN] ‘the brothers/sisters’ is also
possible and indeed attested in the same text from which (24) is taken. If more
siblings (mikim, dab) are involved or more children (dum, hat), the dyad is
obligatorily inflected for plural with -wal:(25)    nb                mikim-wal
        1PL.INCL.POSS      opposite_sex_siblings(dyad)-PL
        ‘we, one brother and sisters’ OR ‘we, brothers and one sister’

by either a pronoun or a proper name immediately preceding the dyadic term,
i.e. in the possessor slot preceding the dyad head. Note that although the
pronoun in (25) is in the possessive form, it receives an appositive
interpretation. All dyadic terms except kam ‘married couple’ can occur with
all (animate) plural possessive pronouns with appositive meaning, e.g. n ‘our
(EXCL)’, nb ‘our (INCL)’, b ‘your’, and  ‘their’ in the possessor position. The
dyad kam can only be preceded by those of the second and third person
(animate) plural, hence *n kam and *nb kam. Why this should be the case is
unclear. Dyads never appear in phonologically eroded form.
    The following collocations of dyadic term and pronoun are attested:(26)   n dum         we (EXCL), father and child
       nb dum        we (INCL), father and child
       b dum         you, father and child
        dum          they, father and child
       n mikim       we (EXCL), siblings of opposite sex
       nb mikim      we (INCL), siblings of opposite sex
       b mikim       you, siblings of opposite sex

       n hat         we (EXCL), mother and child

3.1.8.1. dum ‘father and child’ and hat ‘mother and child’The basic relation expressed by dum and hat is between father and child and
mother and child, respectively. The sex of the child is irrelevant.(27)   b            dum=o                         y

98     3. Word classes and grammatical relations        tl-Ø-io=be
        come.PFV-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
        ‘You, father and child, come.’If the number of children involved is larger than two, the dyads dum and hat
must be suffixed with the pluralizer -wal. The reduplication dumwal dumwal
is used to indicate that more than one father is involved, each with at least one
child. The reduplication hatwal hatwal is used to indicate that more than one
mother is involved, each with at least one child.
    The dyads dum and hat can occur with a proper name instead of a pronoun.
In this case the name refers to the mother or the father, e.g.:(28)    Beliab=e    dum-wal
        PN=SG.M     father_child(dyad)-PL
        ‘Beliab and his children’ (Smith and Weston 1974b: 56)
3.1.8.2. mikim ‘siblings of opposite sex’ and dab ‘siblings of same sex’The relationship denoted by mikim is one between siblings of opposite sex,
while that denoted by dab is between siblings of same sex. The reduplications
mikimwal mikimwal and dabwal dabwal are used for two or more disjoint
groups of siblings of different sex and siblings of same sex, respectively.
   The dyadic terms mikim and dab can occur with a proper name instead of a
possessive pronoun in the possessor slot:(29)    Danenok       dab-wal=i
        PN            same_sex_sibling(dyad)-PL=PL.AN        ngaan-ha-biaan-ib=a
        call.IPFV-3SG.M.R-AUX.IPFV.SS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
        ‘Danenok and his brother were calling out to him, while they…’
        [Danenok]The dyads dab and mikim are also used to refer to the relation between
grandparent and grandchild, of same and different sex, respectively.
3.1.8.3. kam ‘(married) couple’The dyadic term kam behaves slightly differently from the others because it
cannot be combined with first person pronouns, thus *n(b) kam. Use of kam
                                                                   3.1. Nouns   99with pronouns of the second or third person (animate) plural, or with proper
names is fine, e.g. íb kamwal ‘you, and your partner’, Kaseninge kamwal
‘Kasening and his wife, Wentako kamwal ‘Wentak and her husband’.
    Of the five dyads only kam ‘(married) couple’ shows some metaphorical
extension to cover a dyadic relation between inanimates. Consider the
following excerpt from a description of the traditional technique of keb-
weaving, where finely woven threads are tied around both tips of a bow to
hold the bowstring in place:(30)     kam-wal            ke haa-biaan-ib=a
         couple(dyad)-PL do weave-AUX.IPFV.SS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
         ‘they are weaving (i.e. the keb-thread) cross-wise’ (lit. ‘doing couples
         they are weaving (them)’ [Keb weaving]
3.1.9.     Temporal nouns and noun phrasesTemporal nouns are used to locate an event in time. Temporal nouns usually
occur with the article =o in temporal noun phrases and are of neuter 2 gender.
The article can be left out without any change in meaning. Temporal nouns or
noun phrases usually occur immediately after the subject, but are quite mobile
within the clause.
   Temporal noun phrases are:(31)     lo ‘now’
         sino ‘formerly, before’
         memâlo ‘today, now’
         sintalo ‘yesterday’
         sintalo  sintao ‘the day before yesterday’ (lit. ‘yesterday’s yesterday)
         kutimibo ‘at night, in the early morning’
         sinanggwâno ‘in days of yore’
         abuko ‘later, afterwards’An example is (32):(32)     n     memâlo    fút=e
         1SG    now       tobacco=SG.N1         tob-ò-n-i=a
         3SG.LONG.O-take.PFV-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
         ‘I now take the tobacco, and then I ...’ [Rolling
         smokes]
100       3. Word classes and grammatical relationsThe temporal expression bomânomo ‘tomorrow’ is a nominalised adverbial
clause. Its exact analysis and glossing are:(33)      bomâ-(a)n-om-o=o
          light-VBLZ-COND-EXPL.SBJ=N2
          ‘when it gets light’However, bomânomo shows more positional variability than other
nominalised adverbial clauses, in that it does not have to occur clause-initially.
Syntactically, bomânomo behaves like other temporal noun phrases, all of
which typically appear after an overt subject, or utterance initially, if the
subject noun phrase or pronoun is elided e.g.:(34)      n      bomânomo       Boutlantema      taman
          1SG     tomorrow       PN               valley          un-aamab-i=be
          go.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘Tomorrow I will go to the Boutlantema valley.’Hence, I will treat bomânomo – although technically a clause – as a
lexicalized temporal noun phrase with the meaning ‘tomorrow’. The only
items with the same morphological structure in the corpus is sinangwanânomo
‘in the far future’.","[121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126]"

possessive relation is shown by distinct forms of the possessive pronouns,
which are the boldface forms in table 6.2 above. For all others, possession is
indicated by order only. The possessive relation is not marked on the
possessed.(50)    a.     kb genin        ‘your (M) sickness’

        d.      i             ‘their dad’Instead of a possessive pronoun, the possessor slot can also accommodate a
full noun phrase. The following examples illustrate possessors expressed by a

plus article (53).(51)    fút=e               gíng=e

218    6. The noun phrasePossession can be nested recursively. In such sequences, each noun phrase
referent is possessed by the referent of the preceding noun phrase:(54)   nái=e             ken=e            milím=e
       vagina=SG.N1 edge=SG.N1            half=SG.N1
       ‘half of the edge of the vagina’ [Fitibkanib and Dimosson]Typically, there is no overt marker indicating a possessive relation. Rather,
possessor and possessed are simply juxtaposed:(55)   éil=e         gabáam=e
       pig=SG.M head=SG.N1
       ‘a/the pig’s head’There is a clear syntactic structure in Mian attributive possessives. Changing
the order of possessor and possessed might at best considerably alter the
meaning but will in most cases lead to non-sensical utterances.
   An alternative, though much less common construction involves the use of
an overt possessive pronoun between the possessor and the possessed, as in
the following example:(56)   éil=e                    gabáam=e
       pig=SG.M 3SG.M            head=SG.N1
       ‘a/the pig’s head’ (lit. ‘a/the pig, its head’)This construction is rare and it is my impression that it is predominantly found
where the possessor is a proper name, as in (57). Note, however, that this
could also be rendered as Selimine kukub le with the same meaning:(57)   Selimin=e              kukub =le
       PN=SG.M      3SG.M      habit       N2=TOP
       ‘as for Selimin’s habit’ (lit. ‘as for Selimin his habit’) [Selimin]If the possessor is a coordinate noun phrase, the possessive construction with
an overt possessive pronoun referring to the whole set of possessors is
obligatory. This is illustrated for two different types of coordination, namely
(a) coordination with the clitic =sa ‘too’ in (58) and (b) simple juxtaposition
in (59).","[242, 243, 244]"
"
1.7.2.    Orthography in the examplesFor the sake of consistency, I keep the practical orthography developed by
Smith and Weston (1974a) in this grammar. For a justification of the few
changes I made to the orthography, solely for academic purposes, see 2.9.
   The orthography in the examples is to a large extent phonemic with some
instances of morphophonemic spelling. Regular phonological processes, such
as assimilation of /n/ to [m] before /b/ are not incorporated into the
orthography. I will however use phonetic spelling for /l/ to improve
readability. /l/ is spelled d word-initial and syllable-initial after consonant, and
l elsewhere. The change of /b/ to [t] before [n] is incorporated into the
orthography because this only affects a few items in the language, -ûb- ‘give
(PFV)’ before the recipient suffix -ne ‘1SG.R’, -êb ‘take (PFV)’ (and all
compounds involving -êb) before -n ‘SS.SEQ’, tab before -n ‘SS.SEQ’ in
directly inflected directionals, and fàb ‘where, what’ in the interrogative verb
fatnà ‘do what’.
   Tone is rendered phonemically, i.e. tones are written over the stem to
which they belong lexically, even though the tone might in certain cases be
pronounced outside of the stem. The following example illustrates this:(1)      unáng=o         wen-b-o=be       [una wmo]
         woman=SG.F      eat.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
         ‘The woman is eating.’
18    1. The language and its speakersIn proper names that end in /b/ one finds both spellings, e.g.: <Milimab> or
<Milimap>.
    Phonologically conditioned allomorphy is incorporated into the
orthography, e.g. the existential verb bi has an allomorphy bl before /i/, which
is rendered <bl> orthographically.
    Instances of vowel harmony are orthographically rendered as they are
pronounced to enhance readability. For example, the underlying form of the
deontic suffix in (2) is -Vm, but regressive vowel harmony applies.(2)          am=o         ge-n-im-ibo=be
    3PL.AN    house=N2     build.PFV-AUX.PFV-DEONT-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
    ‘They should/ought to build a house.’All proper names are spelled with a capital letter. As I found no consistent
tone patterns for proper names, especially for people’s names, tone is not
indicated. Proper names and loan words are spelled phonetically:(3)     <Ostlelia>      ‘Australia’
        <Jemeni>        ‘Germany’
        <sak>           ‘suck’
        <Pita>          ‘Peter’
        <sekim>         ‘check’
        <mun>           ‘month’

1.6.1.       Landscape and climateThe Mianmin area belongs to the Highlands fringe. The Yapsiei and Hotmin
airstrips are at about 200 metres above sea level, but elevation increases
towards the east and south reaching 760 metres above sea level at Mianmin
airstrip, which is located at 4º54' S and 141º37' E. There are peaks ranging
from 1,000 to 2,800 metres throughout the area. The landscape is
characterized by hills and mountains covered by primary and secondary
rainforest and a tangle of rivers. These conditions make the terrain in parts
almost impassable on the ground, so that 15-minute trips by plane can easily
take a week on foot.
    As the area is both rugged and remote, transport relies on a mixture of the
most modern and the most ancient means of getting around: planes and human
legs. Apart from airstrips, there is hardly any material infrastructure. The
ruggedness of the landscape can probably only be appreciated if one tries to
follow people on their way to their gardens on paths which sometimes are
hardly twenty centimetres wide and adapt to the constant ups and downs of the
country. The remoteness, on the other hand, never became more obvious to
me than when the plane, which usually lands at Mianmin airstrip on a weekly
or fortnightly basis and on which I depended for food and letters, stopped its

    Although Papua New Guinea lies entirely in the tropics, regional
differences regarding temperature, rainfall, and humidity can be considerable.
Telefomin District is renowned for heavy rainfall throughout the year with a
nominal dry season between April and September, which is characterized by
slightly cooler evenings, spectacular red sunsets (bâantom), and less rain, at
least during the day, but generally people judge every day in its own right and
label it am ayam ‘good day’ (Tok Pisin gutpela taim) or am misiam ‘bad day’
(Tok Pisin taim nogut) with a certain flexibility of classification in case the
weather changes quickly. Temperature is relatively constant at about 30°C
during the day and a pleasant 17°C at night. Humidity is high, especially in the
morning, though nowhere near the extremes in lowland or coastal areas.","[38, 39]"

the position of the figure from the viewpoint of the speaker, e.g. met ‘up, close

7.5.     Temporal postpositional phrasesTemporal postpositional phrases are formed with the postposition dim ‘in, on’,
which is metaphorically related to the spatial postposition dim ‘on(to)’. Two
examples are given below:(34)   Febluali=e       dim     -ta
       PN= SG.N1        on      SG.N1-EMPH
       ‘in February’(35)   am     mak        dim=o
       day    another on=N2
       ‘on another day, sometimes, sometime’Temporal postpositional phrases typically appear immediately before the verb
(see 9.10.5).
Chapter 8
Verb morphology
8.0.      IntroductionThe Mian verb is by far the most morphologically complex category in the
language. Many verbs formally distinguish a perfective and an imperfective
stem, which are used to express bounded and unbounded events, respectively.
Aspectual stem distinctions are a typical feature of the Mountain Ok
languages (Healey 1964a: 68). They can also be found in other Papuan
languages, e.g. Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and Abui (Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86).
    Mian is mildly polysynthetic in that all finite verbs obligatorily index their
subject and the recipient object, if a recipient is part of the verb’s argument
structure. A subset of verbs also marks their objects. All argument affixes are
pronominal in nature, i.e. they are not pure agreement affixes. They cross-
reference overt argument noun phrases, which can be freely elided. Argument
affixes agree with overt argument noun phrases in person, number and gender.
If the argument noun phrase is elided, argument affixes agree anaphorically.
    The verb has two slots for tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, one on either
side of the subject suffix slot. The pre-subject slot accommodates a range of
tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, whereas the post-subject slot is filled only by
tense suffixes. The fillers of the post-subject slot are probably more recent
grammaticalizations from erstwhile auxiliary constructions, in which an
inflected auxiliary has been reanalysed as a tense suffix.
    Verbs are inflected directly for certain TAM combinations. Direct
inflection here means that the TAM suffix is appended directly to the verb
stem. A serialization of a lexical verb stem with a form of the existential verb
is required for other TAM combinations. In this case the TAM suffix is
appended to the existential verb.
    It is typical for verbs in many Papuan languages to be marked for
illocutionary force (Foley 1986: 164). Mian has several sentential clitic
particles which attach to the verb to signal the illocutionary force of an
utterance as declarative or quotative, as a question, or as hortative.
    Mian verbs productively form serial verb constructions. Verb serialization
is discussed in section 11.1 under chaining.
244    8. Verb morphology8.1.     Classification of verbsVerbs can be classified according to three criteria, namely position in the
sentence, possibility of direct inflection, and finiteness. A further division in
four conjugation classes will be made in 8.4.
    First, finite verbs can either be directly inflected for various TAM
categories or serialized with an auxiliary. See 8.6.1 on directly inflected verbs
and 8.6.7 on auxiliary-serialized verbs.
    Second, finite verbs are either final or medial. Mian is a clause-chaining
language. Simple sentences contain one final verb, whereas complex
sentences usually consist of clauses chained together, each of which contains a
medial verb while the last clause in a given chain, which forms the end of the
sentence, terminates with a final verb. All final verbs index their subjects and
any of the object(s) that this verb has to index, and can be inflected for all
TAM categories, while medial verbs are slightly more restricted in terms of
their TAM morphology. Medial verbs cannot be inflected for irrealis or
deontic mood. Furthermore, they are never marked for polarity or
illocutionary force. Tense marking with -bio ‘General past’ and -so ‘Hesternal
past’ on medial verbs is possible. Medial verbs partake in the switch-reference
system of the language. They are inflected for same or different subject, i.e.
they have suffixes which mark whether or not the subject of the following
clause is the same. The same suffixes also indicate sequentiality or
simultaneity of events.
    Third, verbs are either finite or non-finite. Any verb (or serial verb
construction) marked for subject is finite, any verb not marked for subject is
non-finite.
    As medial verbs and their morphology are intricately linked to the
phenomenon of clause-chaining, their morphology is described in section 10.2
under clause-chaining constructions.","[267, 268, 269, 270]"
"
10.1.1.     Polar questions with the interrogative clitic =aPolar questions can involve verbal and non-verbal predicates. In the former
case, the illocutionary particle cliticizes to the verb, in the latter case, the
particle cliticizes to the non-verbal predicate term.
    The interrogative clitic =a is realized as =ya when following /a/, e.g.
naka=ya? ‘A man?’. After emphatic and restrictive pronouns, which end in
the emphatic suffix -ta, the interrogative clitic =a is also realized as =ya, but
here the preceding /a/ is deleted, e.g. kb-ta ‘you (M, EMPH)’ and kb-t=ya? ‘Is
it you?’, y-ta ‘only this (restrictive)’ and y-t=ya? ‘Is it only this?’
    In polar questions involving verbal predications the interrogative particle
cliticizes to the finite verb, as in the formulaic greeting in (1):(1)       klayâm             bi-Ø-eb=a?
          properly_good      stay.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=Q
          ‘Are you (staying) well?’ [Observed]Constituent order does not change in questions. The declarative marker =be,
the emphatic/quotative marker =bo, or the exclamative marker =ble are simply
replaced by =a and the utterance receives a marked intonational contour as
opposed to the corresponding declarative sentence. Compare the polar
question in (2) and its declarative counterpart in (3):(2)       kb             mn=e         sm     gwáab

          2SG.M.POSS          child=SG.M        still   small
                                                      10.1. Polar questions   387       bi-Ø-e=be
       stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘Your boy is still small.’The verb in (2) is pronounced bia. On this unusual contracted form, see
section 8.6.5, where irregularities in the inflection of the existential verb are
described.
   Optionally, polar questions can additionally contain the interrogative clitic
m (as opposed to negative mo with low tone). This typically encliticizes to
the final constituent before the predicate, as in (4), but can appear as a free
word if it occurs clause initially, as in example (15) below.(4)    ns      lo=m

       like.PFV-give.PFV-N2.R-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=Q
       ‘Do you like this song?’As with the negative clitic mo, interrogative m may only occur once per
sentence. Thus, it may only appear once in any given clause chain, which
constitutes one sentence. Usually this would be the first clause to signal right
from the start that a question is coming:(5)    kbo       glol-amît=o=m             betelâ’-n-eb=a

       ‘Did you open and again close the window?’ [TMA Questionnaire,
       61]The interrogative marker =a can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to query whether the addressee wants the speaker or the group of which
both speaker and addressee are members to perform a certain action:(6)    ayal=e            kemela-n-an=a?

       go.PFV-REAL-1PL.SBJ.HORT=Q
       ‘Shall we go?’ [Observed]In polar questions involving non-verbal predications the interrogative particle
attaches to either a noun (8), an emphatic pronoun (9), a distal demonstrative
(10), an adjective (11), or an adverb (12). The interrogative clitic m may not
be used. The range of possible hosts for the clitic is exactly co-extensive with
the range of word classes that can appear in the predicate slot in declarative
non-verbal clauses. Detailed information on non-verbal clauses can be found
in section 9.11.(8)    tíl=a?

sentence. In that case, there is no illocutionary clitic. This is illustrated for a
non-verbal predication in (14), and a sentence whose predicate is a finite verb,
in which case the interrogative clitic m is commonly used (15):(14)      yi=e              yi        bleka?
          wound=SG.N1        wound or

          or
          ‘Do you understand what I’m saying?’
          (Lit: ‘Are you hearing as I’m saying, or?’) [Mianmin and Telefomin]Questions with bleka ‘or’ at the end are not leading but rather neutral polar
questions that introduce the (implied) negation of the proposition as a second
alternative, which is equally probable. Thus, the alternatives offered in (14)
are that the referent either is a wound or is not a wound. This is a type of polar
question because the appropriate responses are ‘yes’ or ‘no’.","[412, 413, 414, 415]"

13.2.4.     Adverbial clauses with the article =oThese display clausal syntax, yet they are formally treated as noun phrases
because they always bear the article =o reflecting neuter 2 gender. Like
medial clauses, adverbial clauses can be topic-marked with =le as well. In the
following examples the adverbial clause appears enclosed in square brackets.
    The verbs in adverbial clauses are final verbs, i.e. they have their own
polarity value and can be inflected for irrealis. A temporal interpretation (24)
or a locative interpretation (25) is possible:(24)      [naka=i                   utl-Ø-ib=o]

conditional interpretation, for example:(26)      [n      alél-sa      n-im-i=o]
          1SG      wife-with    stay.PFV-COND-1SG.SBJ=N2          sein-amab-i=be

13.2.5.     Topicalized adverbial clausesAdverbial clauses with the article =o can be marked as topical with the topic
clitic =le to indicate that a whole event is relevant to what follows:(28)      [          utlaan          dama-Ø-ib=o=le]

          ‘so when they grew up, they multiplied and then ...’ [Dimosson]In example (28), the topicality of the clause marked as the topic lies in the fact
that it is a necessary prerequisite for the event of the succeeding clause to take
place. Before humans can procreate they need to grow up.
                                                        13.2. Adverbial clauses   49713.2.6.     Adverbial clauses with the postpositions temwât ‘while’ and dim ‘at
            the time when’Temwât ‘while’, which itself consists of the nominal postposition tem ‘in(to)’
(from the noun tem ‘inside’) and the directional wt ‘across’, can follow the
verb of an adverbial clause to specify that the event described by the
preceding clause is on-going at a certain point in time, at which another event
takes place so that both situations temporally overlap, at least partially. The
whole construction has to be marked as adverbial with the article =o.
Intonationally, temwât belongs to the adverbial clause. The characteristic
pause indicating the beginning of a new clause comes after, never before
temwât.(29)      [kbo      fút=e                gen-b-eb                    temwât=o]

          ‘While you are rolling a smoke, a gecko shat on it for you.’One also finds two alternative constructions to this. In (30) the article =o

          ‘while they were begetting many generations, a certain man took a
          wife, and then he…’ [Dimosson]In (31) there is a high-toned free pronoun between the verb in the adverbial
clause and temwât:(31)      [walo        te-b-ib                                  temwât=o]

       3SG.F_CL.O-take.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED=TOP
       ‘while they were begetting many generations, a certain man took a wife,
       and then he…’ [Elicited as a contrast to (30)]This seems to be the original construction in which the free pronoun
functioning as a resumptive pronoun anaphorically refers to the proposition of
the whole preceding clause. It is plausible that (29) and (30) represent
successive stages of phonological erosion of this pronoun. While it is realized
as a toneless clitic in (30), it has completely disappeared in (29).
   Dim ‘at the time when’, which is basically a nominal postposition meaning
‘on(to)’ (from the noun dim ‘top’), can follow the verb of an adverbial clause
to specify that at a certain time while one situation holds true (e.g. a state), a
new situation comes in. Like adverbials with temwât ‘while’, the whole
construction has to be marked as an adverbial by =o. Intonationally, dim
belongs to the adverbial clause. The characteristic pause indicating the
beginning of a new clause comes after, never before dim.
   Dim shows those same three constructional variants, described above for
temwât. In (32), the variant with the free pronoun is illustrated here:(32)   [sinanggwâno       naka=i=a                unáng=a=i

13.2.7.    The semantic difference between temwât ‘while’ and dim ‘at the

subtle. While both indicate that two events overlap, the former is preferred, if
one wants to express that one event occurs inside another one and that there is
some interaction between participants or interference between the events. The
latter only indicates a temporal overlap. Compare the following two examples:(34)      [         miting          ke-b-ib=o                     temwât=o]

500       13. Embedding13.3.       Relative clausesRelative clauses in Mian serve the function that many scholars have identified
for relative clauses in all languages, namely to delimit the potential reference
of a noun (e.g. Comrie 1981: 136). More specifically, a relative relation
involves two events (or states of affairs), a main and a dependent one, which
share exactly one participant. “[A] participant of the main SoA [State of
Affairs – SF] is identified within a set of possible referents by mentioning
some other SoA in which he or she takes part” (Cristofaro 2003: 195).
    Mian relative clauses are finite and can be either prenominal or head-
internal. There is no formal distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive
relative clauses. As the function of the latter ones is not to delimit potential
reference of a noun but rather to give additional information pertaining to the
referent in question, they are not covered by Comrie’s (1981) definition.
Nevertheless, this section also includes some examples of relative clauses
which are clearly of the non-restrictive type in English. In Mian the restrictive
vs. non-restrictive distinction is not formally expressed.","[521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526]"

                                                  8.10. Noun-verb idioms    3278.10.    Noun-verb idiomsMian has a range of lexicalized idiomatic expressions which can consist of a
noun adjunct followed by a verb. The semantic relation can be opaque. Noun-
verb idioms are for example:(225) aaie fuela/aaie fua     [water bathe]             ‘bathe’
      abén gi/ abén gila      [laughter laugh]          ‘laugh’
      tamaan kou              [fornication copulate]    ‘fornicate, rape’
      usáan fu                [vomit cook]              ‘vomit’
      fètang kun              [carrion_smell smell]     ‘smell putrid’
      tamamèin klâ            [shock fix]               ‘be frightened’
      mma taa                [spittle spit]            ‘spit’What all of these have in common is that the noun preceding the verb
functions as an adjunct and not as an object. It does not have argument status.
Nominal adjuncts are highly restricted in their syntax. They have to
immediately precede the verb and cannot be modified with a relative clause.
Objects on the other hand can be fronted and modified with a relative clause.
   Within the noun-verb type of idiom, two cases have to be distinguished: (a)
the nominal adjunct can be omitted without a difference in meaning and (b)
omission of the adjunct results in a semantic change.
   An example of the first type is aaie fuela/aaie fua ‘bathe’, which still
means ‘bathe’ when aaie ‘the water’ is omitted:(226) fua-biaan-ib=to
      bathe.IPFV-AUX.IPFV.SS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
      ‘while they were bathing, they…’ [Sobining]With the second type, the adjunct cannot be omitted without affecting the
semantics. Compare:(227) kou-we-b-e=a
      have_sex-3SG.F.R-DS.SIM-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
      ‘while he was having sex with her, she…’ [Newlyweds](228) tamaan=o          kou-ye-b-ib=ta
      fornication=N2 have_sex-PL.AN.R-DS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
      ‘while they were raping them, …’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]
328     8. Verb morphology8.11.     The ‘Immediate action’ constructionMian has a special construction for immediate actions involving the function
verb ge/ga~gena ‘say’. It is used to express that the speaker desires or intends
to perform an action immediately after the moment of speaking or that an
event is about happen. In contrast to the coverb-function verb construction
with ge/ga ‘say’ (see 8.9 above), the imperfective stem gena is preferred over
ga in the immediate action construction, e.g.:(229) fút=e                  gíng=e
      tobacco=SG.N1          midrib=SG.N1        tob-tlâa’-n-ang-gena-b-i=be
        3SG.LONG.O-remove.PFV-REAL-IMMACT.NANPL.SBJ-say.IPFV-IPFV-
        1SG.SBJ=DECL
        ‘I’m about to remove the midrib of the tobacco leaf.’ [Rolling smokes]Apart from the suffix -ang ‘Immediate action (not animate plural subject)’ for
singular subjects, there is also -om ‘Immediate action (animate plural subject)’
for animate plural subjects. The latter suffix sometimes assimilates to the
following velar // and is realized as -ong:(230) un-om-ge-n-ob=a
      go.PFV-IMMACT.AN.PL.SBJ-say.PFV-SEQ-1PL.SBJ=MED
      ‘we wanted to go and then…’ [Ala ritual]Instead of the imperfective stem of the function verb gena~ga ‘say’ inflected
with -b ‘Imperfective’ one also finds the inchoative verb form with
-m in the same construction. There is no obvious difference in meaning, e.g.:(231) eka       imak=e             ybbaka
      and       husband=SG.M       as_well        dob-Øˆ-ang-gena-m-e
        3SG.M_CL.O-take.PFV-IMMACT.NANPL.SBJ-say.IPFV-INCH-3SG.N1.SBJ        kesoa
        because
        ‘because it (the water) was about to take the husband as well, …’
        [Flood]
                                  8.11. The ‘Immediate action’ construction   329The ‘Immediate action’-construction is very likely a reanalysis of an
embedded quotative construction (see 13.1). The erstwhile hortative suffixes
-an ‘1SG.HORT’ and -om ‘1PL.HORT’ are still discernible (see 8.6.8 on subject
marking in hortative forms). Compare (229) above to the following example
(232), which is also attested in synchronic Mian. The embedded hortative
sentence is given in brackets:(232) [fút=e                gíng=e
      tobacco=SG.N1         midrib=SG.N1       tob-tlâa’-n-an=o]
       3SG.LONG.O-remove.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ.HORT=HORT       gena-b-i=be
       say.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I think I should remove the midrib of the tobacco leaf.’There are several reasons why I set up ‘Immediate action’ as a distinct
construction. Speaker intuitions about word boundaries indicate that
tobtlâa’nanggenabibe ‘I am about to remove a long object’ as one word, while
tobtlâa’nano genabibe ‘I think I should remove a long object’ is judged to be
two separate words. This speaker judgment is supported by the fact that the
hortative subject suffix -an has assimilated to the following /g/ of ge/ga~gena
‘say’ and is always realized as -ang in the immediate action construction.
   More important, however, is that the former behaves like a single
phonological word (with one accent and one tonal melody), while the latter
consists of two separate phonological words.
   Morphologically, in embedded hortatives the subjects in the embedded and
the matrix clause can vary independently of each other, whereas this is not
possible in the ‘Immediate action’-construction. The identity of the immediate
action suffix is entirely predictable from the number and animacy of the
subject of the matrix verb. If the subject is singular, -ang is used, if it is
animate plural -om ~ -ong.
   Finally, the construction for immediate actions allows inanimate subjects,
e.g. the water in (229) above, while quotative constructions (whether
declarative, interrogative, or hortative) are restricted to subjects which have a
consciousness and are capable of intentional action.
Chapter 9
Argument structure and the syntax of the clause
9.0.        IntroductionThis chapter deals with the argument structure of the verb and with the order
of constituents in the clause. The unmarked constituent orders in Mian are SV
in intransitive clauses and AOV in transitive clauses. While the verb is almost
always final in any clause (a marginal exception will be dealt with in 11.2.10),
the order of core arguments and adverbial adjuncts is less rigidly fixed.
    This chapter also contains sections on non-verbal clauses, reciprocals and a
note on causatives.
    Mian is head-marking at clause level (Nichols 1996). There is no
morphological case or adpositional marking for core grammatical relations.
Rather relevant syntactic relations are marked on the verb. Most arguments in
the clause, i.e. subjects, recipients, and for some verbs also the object, are
indexed on the verb by affixes.
    Mian has intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, ambitransitive, and
impersonal (or atransitive) verbs. Compounding with -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ with a
quasi-applicative function is used as a valency-increasing device in the
perfective to derive transitives from intransitives and ditransitives from
transitives in a highly productive way. In the imperfective, recipient suffixes
are directly appended to a verb to increase its valency.
    The only clearly underived ditransitive verb in Mian is -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’.
Underived ditransitives show triple agreement, i.e. they index the subject, the
object (the gift) and the recipient with an affix (see section 9.5 on
ditransitives).
    Ambitransitive verbs (Dixon 1994, 2002) can be used intransitively or
transitively without any derivational process.
    There are also a few impersonal verbs with an expletive subject marker,
which denote the arrival of morning and afternoon and the passage of time.
    All finite verbs must contain a subject suffix indexing the subject of the
verb, which in the rare case of impersonal verbs is an expletive (-o). This form
is homophonous to the third person singular feminine subject marker.
    I define the argument structures as follows:-      Intransitives have exactly one core argument (S).
-      Transitives have exactly two core arguments (both A and O).
-      Ditransitives have exactly three core arguments (A, O and R).
332      9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause-      Ambitransitives have either one (S) or two core arguments (both A and
       O).
-      Atransitives (impersonal verbs) have no core arguments.","[351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358]"
"
6.4.      Attributive possessionAs we are dealing with noun phrase structure here, this section is confined to
attributive possession. For a description of predicative possession, see section
9.11.3.
    Mian has one construction for encoding attributive possession in which the
possessor precedes the possessed. This is the typical order for verb-final
languages (Dryer 2007: 62). The possessor slot can be filled either by a
possessive pronoun or by a full noun phrase.
    In the most common and least complex case the possessor slot is filled by a
possessive pronoun. The forms are set out in the tables 6.2 and 6.3. The free
pronoun forms have been included to illustrate the obvious formal relations
between the two pronoun series. Distinct forms for the possessive and the free
pronoun series are given in boldface. Grey areas indicate the neutralization of
a gender contrast.",[242]

                            -sA few comments regarding this table are necessary here to orient the reader.
All suffixes will be dealt with in detail later in this section.
    The suffix -n in medial verbs has two functions. If the subject of the
marked clause is first person singular,1 it unequivocally indicates SS and event
sequentiality. In all other person-number combinations, -n functions as a more
general marker of event sequentiality and semantic coherence between clauses
and the subject of the subsequent clause can be the same or different.
    There is a notable exception to this rule. If a medial verb can only ever be
inflected with -n, this suffix invariably signals SS and SEQ in all person and
number combinations. This holds true for the six directionals if inflected
directly (see 9.1.2) and the verb -êb ‘take (in order to carry)’ and all forms
which contain -êb as an element, such as -silêb ‘follow’ (also see 8.6.4).
    For the sake of completeness, I included the auxiliary -biaan in table 11.5
above, which is used in auxiliary-serialized medial verbs to indicate SS and
event simultaneity. As it does not fall under direct inflection, it will be
discussed further below (11.2.5.3).
    The suffix -nab always indicates DS and event sequentiality, but also
signals that there is a short interval until the ensuing event commences.
    The suffix -s always indicates DS and event sequentiality. Additionally, -s
tends to be used when there is a tight temporal or even a causal relationship
between the events described by two adjacent clauses within a clause chain.
426    11. Chaining constructions11.2.3.1. Unusual behaviour of -n ‘(SS.)SEQ’There is an interesting typological quirk in the Mian S/R system. The suffix -n
‘(SS.)SEQ’ only unequivocally marks SS plus event sequentiality if the subject
of the marked clause is first person singular. The event described in the
marked clause temporally precedes the event in the reference clause and
events are sequentially performed by the same individual, as in (40):(40)   n        memâlo     fút=e

       I…’ [Rolling smokes]In a Reichenbachian model (Reichenbach 1947), the temporal structure of
events in (40) may be represented as follows (‘e1’ and ‘e2’ refer to the event
described in the marked and the reference clause, respectively; ‘<’ means
‘prior to’):(41)   e1 < e2      ——|——|———>
                      e1 e2If the subject of the marked clause is anything but first person singular the
subject of the reference clause can also be different, as in (42):(42)   te-n-ib=a                               mak=i         te

marked clause (e1) is on-going when the event of the reference clause
commences. Subject reference is disjoint. The reference clause event (e2) can
be a bounded event which is properly contained within e1 as in (43):(43)   ngaan-b-e=a                              naka=i

                              e2In example (45) -b ‘DS.SIM’ is used to describe a situation in which the event

             stone=SG.N1     break.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.N1.SBJ=MED
             ‘While they were blowing (at) the stone,2 he was watching
             them and the stone opened (and then they…)’ [Danenok]If both e1 and e2 are represented by medial verbs inflected with -b, as in (45)
above, the only restrictions regarding the temporal interpretation of the events
with respect to each other is that e2 must not commence before e1 did. In that
428    11. Chaining constructionssense, even a sequence of two medial clauses with simultaneous events is
iconic. Events can be temporally co-extensive but they do not have to be.
    In (45) above, there is a third event e3 which is bounded (namely the
opening of the stone gate in the third clause). This event e3 terminates e1 (i.e.
the blowing on the stone) but nothing is said about whether e2 is terminated as
well. The ‘watching’-event may continue after the stone gate has opened.
    Thus, the temporal structure of the events in (45) can be represented as
follows (I use the symbol ‘’ to indicate the endpoint of an unbounded event
as opposed to ‘|’ which indicates the occurrence of a bounded event):(46)   e1 O e 2   e1—————
       e2 O e3    e2—————|·····>
                         e3In the spontaneous corpus, -b ‘DS.SIM’ in the marked clause is indeed very
consistently followed by DS in the reference clause and speakers generally
judged clause chaining constructions with -b ‘DS.SIM’ in the marked clause
and a co-referent subject in the reference clause to be ungrammatical.
Contrary to speaker judgments, however, such cases are attested in the
spontaneous corpus (as long as the events described are simultaneous), for
example:(47)   e1   ke-ha-b-e=a

reference clause to have disjoint reference. The difference in their semantics is
hard to grasp. While -Ø ‘DS.SEQ’ only indicates DS and event sequentiality,
-s ‘DS.SEQ’ seems to specify that the event in the marked clause is a necessary
condition for the event in the reference clause to take place. This contrast
between -Ø and -s can be illustrated with example (49):(49)    e1   gíng=e            tob-tlâa’-n-i=a
             midrib=SG.N1      3SG.LONG.O-remove.PFV-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED        e2   tob-kimà-Ø-i=a

             ‘I remove the midrib (of the tobacco leaf), put it (the tobacco) in
             the fire, as it has dried, I break it (and then I …)’ [Rolling
             smokes]There are four events (e1 to e4), all of which occur sequentially. In the clauses
describing e1, e2, and e4, the subject is the narrator (first person singular). The
third clause (e3) has a different subject from the rest of this text chunk, namely
the tobacco, and it specifies a necessary condition for the event in the fourth
clause to take place, i.e. the tobacco having dried (e3) is a necessary
prerequisite for the speaker in (49) to break it (e4). In general, -s is used
instead of -Ø if the event in the marked clause is necessary for the one in the
reference clause to take place. Compare the following two examples (50) and
(51):(50)    kbo      te-s-eb=ta

        work(TP) do-AUX.PFV-IRR.PL.AN.SBJ-1PL.SBJ=DECL
        ‘When you come and we’ll work.’The occurrence of the -Ø DS marker is restricted by phonological context. In
final verbs, zero is a variant of -n ‘Realis’. Alternation is phonologically
conditioned by the subject suffix which always follows the aspect suffix. If the
subject suffix starts with /i/, as in the first person singular -i and the second
and third plural animate -ib, -n is commonly replaced by zero. In all other
cases, that is if the subject suffix starts with // as in the second singular -eb or
third singular masculine -e or with /o/ as in third singular feminine -o and first
plural -ob, zero alternation is possible (but far less common), provided that
omission of -n does not lead to a clash of like vowels. If zero alternation leads
to such a clash, -n has to surface in the pre-subject slot, e.g. baa-n-e=be ~
baa-Ø-e=be ‘he’s said’, ge-n-e=be ‘he’s built’, but *ge-Ø-e=be). Hence, there
are certain verb forms which simply cannot have zero in the pre-subject slot
by virtue of their phonological make-up. DS-zero in medial verbs is limited in
the same way. Certain verb forms cannot have the zero DS marker for
phonological reasons. Zero-marked medial verb forms like *ge-Ø-e=ta ‘he
built’ do not exist because of like-vowel clash. The only possible DS medial
form is ge-s-e=ta.
    There is a further phonological restriction for DS-zero, which is not as
obvious in final verbs as it is in medial verbs. Realization as zero is impossible
if the result means that two vowel-only syllables follow. As most final verbs
end in =be ‘DECL’, this situation does not arise often, but it does in questions:(52)    mukùng=e       goi-ˆs’-o-n-e=a? (*mukùng=e goi-ˆs’-o-Ø-e=a?)
        nose=SG.N1     smash.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.F.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=Q
        ‘Has he smashed her nose?’This phonological restriction is much more relevant for medial verbs because
the standard medial clitic =a ‘and’ does not start with a consonant. Medial
verb forms like *mukùng=e goi-ˆs’-o-Ø-e=a ‘he’s smashed her nose and then
she …’ are ruled out. If the medial clitic =ta is used, which starts in a
consonant, zero can alternate freely with -s to indicate sequentiality and DS in
medial verbs. The form goi-ˆs’-o-Ø-e=ta is correct.
   Three important and highly frequent verbs have alternative “zero-
compatible” stems which all end in a consonant /l/ to avoid like-vowel clash,
e.g. te ~ tl ‘come (PFV)’, bi ~ bl ‘exist, stay (IPFV)’, and ge ~ gl ‘say (PFV)’.
                          11.2. Medial verb morphology and clause chaining   43111.2.3.4. -m ‘Inchoative imperfective’ plus -s ‘DS.SEQ’In medial verbs, the S/R marker -s ‘DS.SEQ’ can be suffixed to an imperfective
verb stems already inflected with -m ‘Inchoative imperfective’ (see 8.6.1.6).
Such a form focuses on the inception of an action or event. In this case, -s
indicates that a change of subjects will take place in the reference clause even
though the situation described by the verb in the marked clause might still
hold when the event of the reference clause comes into effect, as in (53):(53)   e1   mele-ˆb’-a-s-o=a

            ‘as it (a wallaby) touched him (a baby), he started to cry,
            so it ran away and then …’ [Afoksitgabáam]The temporal structure of the events in this example can be represented as
follows. Note that event e2 refers to the inception of the ‘crying’, as expressed
by the inchoative form me-m:(54)   e1 > e2 > e3   ——|—|——————>
                        e1 e2 —|——>
                               e3There are no medial verbs which only bear the inchoative aspect suffix -m.
The sequence -m plus -s is possible in medial verbs only.
11.2.3.5. -nab ‘DS.SEQ.SHORT INTERVAL’The marker -nab in medial verbs indicates DS and sequentiality and also a
short interval between events:(55)   aaleb=e          abuko     y

          ‘later they left the father there and after a short while he jumped
          up and then ...’ [Crows]It is difficult to specify the exact length of the interval indicated by -nab. My
corpus contains examples with intervals from a few minutes as in (55) to a few
hours, for instance from dusk to about midnight.","[451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458]"
"(82)   It is realized as /LHLub/ after consonants and /LHLb/ after vowels:
       un-ûb’-a       [go.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.M.R]         ‘go for him (PFV)’
       fu-ˆb’-a       [cook.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.M.R]       ‘cook for him (PFV)’(83)   The forms are /LHLut/ (after consonants) and /LHLt/ (after vowels)
       before /n/:
       fu-ˆb’-a [cook.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.M.R] ‘cook for him (PFV)’
       fu-ˆt’-ne [cook.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R]       ‘cook for me (PFV)’However, allomorphy cannot be fully explained phonologically. For four
perfective verb stems, all of which end in /a/, klâ ‘fix, complete’, al tlia ‘be
angry’, -nâ’ ‘hit, kill’, and hà’ ‘break’, /LHLub/ or /LHLut/ are consistently
chosen even though the stem ends in a vowel, and we would expect /LHLb/ or
/LHLt/, e.g.:(84)              no        snuk=e
       3SG.M       rodent    rat=SG.M       a-nâ’-ût’-ne-n-e=be
       3SG.M.O-kill.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He has killed the rat for me.’This process is irregular. It does not apply to any other perfective stems
ending in /a/. For example, -â’ ‘leave, let’, and -bià ‘throw’ do select the
expected ‘give’-allomorphs /LHLb/ or /LHLt/ since they end in a vowel.
                                                     8.5. Argument marking    275(85)    The form is /LHLs/ when following the diphthongs /ai/ and /i/ and
        preceding another vowel:        wai-ˆb’-ke     [wait.PFV-give.PFV-2SG.R]          ‘wait for you (PFV)’
        wai-ˆs’-a      [wait.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.M.R]        ‘wait for him (PFV)’Again, allomorphy cannot be fully explained phonologically. After the stem
dei ‘leave (PFV)’ (of the verb dê’ ‘desist’), ‘give’ is always realized as /LHLb/
never as /LHLs/, although this verb conforms to the rule in (85) above.
    The resulting compound verb complex constitutes one phonological word,
e.g. regarding tone assignment and tonal contrast, and both verbs in the
compound have to share the same subject and object argument.
Concomitantly, any object cross-referencing prefix on the second verb in the
serialization (in this case ‘give’) is gapped. This is a regular process in all V-V
compounds in Mian and attested with other verbs apart from ‘give’. For
instance, -êb ‘pick up, take along (PFV)’, which requires cross-referencing of
its object with a classificatory prefix when appearing on its own, as in (86),
appears without this prefix as the second element in a compounds, as in
example (87):(86)    alél   -to             awók=o

        ‘the marsupials he has killed and brought’ [Crows]In such compounds with for -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’, the recipient argument will
mostly be animate, but does not have to be. Table 8.8 list all recipient suffix
form for -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ including the forms for the neuter genders.
    In most cases, ‘give’ is compounded with a stem without causing any
morphological change in the form of this stem. There are some exceptions to
this general rule. Verbs which surface in a slightly different form when
compounded with ‘give’ are listed in (88) below:

        ‘He made a fire for her.’As ‘give’ is very productively used in compounds with another verb to
increase the valency of the whole verb complex by one, its function is
essentially that of an applicative. Indeed there are two reasons to assume that
the form -(û)b’- is undergoing grammaticalization into an applicative
morpheme.
   First, there are two phonological processes that the compounded form
undergoes which never apply to lexical -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’: (a) reduction to just
/LHLb/ after a vowel, and (b) realization as /LHLs/ when preceded by the vowel
sequences /i/ or /ai/ and followed by another vowel.

(PFV)’ to the semantically much more general meaning of the valency-
increasing device, which can for instance introduce benefactives and
possessors, which not necessarily have to be recipients (see 8.5.5.4).
   For some verbs, compounding with -(û)b’- ‘give’ is obligatory. These
verbs only occur in a derived form with a recipient introduced as an argument
of ‘give’, e.g. (91) for -fu- ‘send (PFV)’ and (92) for ale- ‘show (PFV)’. Note
that the former also obligatorily indexes its object, whereas the latter does not:(91)              baa-n-o=a                              futâan=o
