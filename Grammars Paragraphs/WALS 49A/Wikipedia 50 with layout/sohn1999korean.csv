   The equative particle mankhum,                 the analogy particle chelem,            and the derived
analogy particle kathi (kath ‘same’, -i (AD)) behave similarly, as in Mia nun Milan.i

teacher’) which have the honorific title suffix -nim and plain address terms such as
Mia ya ‘Mia!’ and Milan a ‘Milan!’ which consist of a given name and the vocative
particle (y)a are functionally the same, in that they are used to draw the attention of
the addressee in a discourse context, do not constitute an argument (such as the
subject) of a sentence, and reflect the relationship between the speaker and addressee
in terms of social status. Compare (132a) with (132b) and notice the status difference
implied in the two utterances. In (132a), the speaker and addressee are most likely
either in a child-child relationship or in an adult-child relationship, whereas in
(132b), the addressee is an adult and the speaker is either an adult equal or inferior or
a child.(132)          a.   Tongmin        a,       ne       eti         ka-ni?

                    ‘Sir (lit. “esteemed teacher’)! Where are you going?’   Vocative particles are (i) a (after a consonant)/ya (after a vowel) [plain level], (ii) i
(after a consonant)//ZERO          (after a vowel)         [intimate     level], and (iii) i(sije [hyper-
deferential level] which appears to have developed from the copula i, the subject
honorific suffix -si, and the obsolete vocative suffix -e. The hyper-deferential form
without -si is contracted to ye after a vowel.
342                The Korean language      The plain-level vocative form (y)a following a given name is typically used to
address a child by another child or an adult, but also an adult by his or her parents or
by a friend whose friendship began in childhood. As in (132a), the plain vocative form
agrees, in a sentence, with the plain personal pronoun ne ‘you’ and plain sentence
enders      such    as   -fa        (declarative),     -ni    (interrogative),      -ca     (propositive),       and    -/a
(imperative).
      The   plain-level        vocative         particle     is also attached       to plural        nominals,     as in
haksayng-tul a ‘Students!’ and celm-un i-tul a ‘Youngsters!’ and used in idiomatic
expressions such as papo ya ‘You fool!’, i kes a ‘You!’ (lit. ‘this thing!’), pyengsin a
“You idiot!’, apem a ‘Look here!’ (lit.‘(child’s) father!’, addressed to one’s married
son), enni ya ‘Sis!’, and emma ya ‘Mommy!’,
(133)              emem        4,         eti         ka-ss-ta(ka)     w-ass-ni?

                   (addressed to one’s married daughter or daughter-in-law)
      The intimate vocative particle i/ZERO is attached to personal names typically to
address adolescent persons (generally males) by another adolescent or an adult. It is
also used to address one’s son-in-law or other inferior adult relatives. It agrees, in a
sentence, with the intimate personal pronoun caney ‘you’ and the familiar sentence
enders -ney (declarative),                -na/-nunka         (interrogative),    -sey (propositive),         and       -key
(imperative).

                         “Yongho! Let’s go together.’
   The hyper-deferential vocative particle i(sije is not used to address living people in
face-to-face situations. God, Christ, or one’s deceased lover (in a literary style) may
be addressed with these particles, as in cwu ye ‘lord!’, hananim isie ‘oh, God!’, im ie
‘oh, my beloved!’. This particle agrees with the obsolete hyper-deferential sentence
enders -naita (declarative), -naikka (interrogative), and -sose (imperative), and blunt-
level enders which used to be polite enders.

              ‘Lord! Please look after us.’
The hyper-deferential particle ye is also used to address a group of people in writing,
in which case the sentence enders may be either the plain- or blunt-level forms, as in
tongpho ye ilena-lalilena-o ‘Brethren! Wake up!’
9.5.8         Case-particle stacking
A series of case particles may occur in sequence all associated with the same nominal,
reflecting the agglutinative nature of Korean. However, not all of such stacked case
particles perform active case functions in a given sentence as will be discussed
shortly. In the sentences in (136), the particles performing an active case function are
underlined.(136)         a.     yeki    eyse        puthe                      ka          wuli        ttang      —i-a.

                     ‘America’s war against Japan in Saipan’   In (136a), three case particles occur in sequence. While the locative and ablative
cases, marked respectively by eyse ‘at, in’ and puthe ‘from’, are inert in that they are
not associated with the predicate (the copula in this case), only the nominative case,
344               The Korean languagemarked by the particle ka, is related to the copula as its subject. The two inert case
particles simply contribute their semantic content to the subject noun phrase. In this
respect they are like delimiters. In contrast to such inert cases, the case which
maintains its syntactic relation with the predicate may be called the ‘privileged’ case.
Thus, in (136a) the nominative case is the privileged case, while the locative and
ablative case particles are privative.
      In (136b), the three case particles eykey, lo, and ul are flanked by a delimiter (man
‘only’). Here, the directional /o is the privileged case and is related to the predicate
ponayta ‘send’, whereas the particle eykey ‘to’ and the accusative particle u/ become
privative and          function as delimiters. In (136c), the source particle eyse and the
connective particles wa ‘and’ and na ‘or’ all function as privileged, in that the former
is related to the predicate and the latter two connect two noun phrases.
      In genitive constructions such as (136d, e), the privileged syntactic case is always
the genitive      (marked       by the particle uy) which        relates the cooccurring       nominal
genitively to the head nominal.               In addition, one or more semantic cases may also
occur    before        the genitive   case.    In (136d),   the privileged   semantic   case     is the
directional marked by /o which semantically relates its cooccurring nominal Kim-
sensayng eykey to the head verbal noun Aoysin. Here, the static locative case marked
by eykey is privative. In (136e), the dynamic locative case marked by eyse and the
comitative case marked by Awa are privileged.
      Which one of a sequence of case particles becomes privileged depends on the
argument structure (or thematic roles) of the predicate. For instance, the copula ita
requires a theme subject, hence the nominative case in yeki eyse puthe ka must be
privileged in (136a). Similarly, in (136b), the predicate ponayta                 ‘send’ requires a
directional role, hence the directional case in Kim sensayng eykey lo man                         ul is
privileged. Dependence on the argument structure of a predicate can be more clearly
observed by comparing the two sentences in (137).
(137)             a.     tong-ccok    ulo     man    ul —   ka-ss-ta.
                         east-side   DR only AC’          go-PST-DC
                         ‘(He) went only to the east side.’                  b.     tong-ccok     ulo    man    yl      po-ass-ta.
                         east-side     DR     only   AC — see-PST-DC
                         ‘(He) looked only toward the east side.’
   In a sequence of cases which are equally case-relatable to the predicate, the last
one acquires priority in case privilege hierarchy over the preceding ones. Thus, in Kim
sensayng-nim eykey lo, both eykey ‘to/at’ and /o ‘towards’ can be relatable to ponayta

‘send’, but /o is regarded as privileged and eykey is interpreted as a static human
locative ‘at’. As noticed in this example, there is a slight semantic difference in
certain semantic case particles between when the particle is used as a privileged one
and when it is used as a privative one. In a privative case, a goal particle (kkey, eykey,
ey) in a privileged case loses its goal meaning and functions as a static locative, and
the directional particle (uj/o also loses its directional meaning ‘toward’ and denotes a
general direction, as in hak.kyo lo puthe w-ass-ta ‘(He) came from the direction of
school.’ The ablative puthe means ‘from’ in a privileged case as in hak.kyo lo puthe
w-ass-ta, but ‘starting from, beginning with’ in a privative case as in (136a),
9.6             Delimiter constructionsWhile case particles mark syntactic relations among               major constituents, delimiter
particles delimit the meaning of the cooccurring element with little syntactic function.
Many case particles including the nominative ka/i, accusative (J)ul, ablative puthe, and
directional (ujlo behave like delimiters with their own semantic content, especially
when they become privative case particles as observed in 9.5.8. Delimiters appear
most productively in noun phrases but also with adverbs, complement clauses, and
even main sentences. Due to their syntactic and semantic properties, delimiters can be
classified into two types, constituent and sentential (or discoursal) delimiters, the
former occurring in noun phrases (including nominalized clauses) and with adverbs
and complement clauses, and the latter occurring at the end of a sentence and/or after
any major constituent.","[357, 358, 359, 360, 361]"

9.5               Case marking
A nominal expression (NP) takes a grammatical case in an utterance. Grammatical
cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, static locative, dynamic locative, source,
               9 Grammatical structure                                                                        327
goal, instrument, and directional indicate the grammatical relation that a noun has vis-
a-vis its predicate, another noun (in genitive, comitative, and connective cases), a
clause (in multiple nominative constructions), or a discourse (in the vocative case).
Cases are marked by case particles, which may often be omitted in various discourse
contexts. Nominative, accusative, dative, static locative, goal, and genitive particles
are frequently omitted in sentences, especially in colloquial speech, because these
cases are most easily predictable from the syntactic structure, word order, and the
nature of the predicate used. Thus, for instance, in Mia enni hak.kyo ka-ss-ta ‘Mia’s
older sister went to school’, Mia is still in the genitive case, enni in the nominative
case, and hak.kyo in the goal case, despite their not being marked by any particle.
   Cases may be divided into two groups: (1) those that mainly indicate syntactic
functions   of nominals,         such   as nominative        (usually      functioning         as subject     and
complement),        accusative     (usually   functioning         as   object),        and   genitive   (usually
functioning as possessive), and (ii) those that mainly express semantic functions of
nominals such as dative, goal, locative, source, directional, instrument, and function.
For instance, in Alan.i ka hak.kyo eyse w-ass-e ‘Alan came from school’, Alan plays
the grammatical function of the subject of the sentence, whereas hak.kyo, marked by
the source particle eyse ‘from’, has the semantic function of indicating the location
from which Alan came. This dichotomy, however, does not preclude syntactic case
particles from having some semantic functions as well and vice versa.
   Among the particle slots of a noun phrase, nominative, accusative, and genitive
particles occupy the last slot, whereas the semantic particles occur in an inner slot
even before the delimiter slots, as in na man i (I only NM)                             ‘only I’ (subject), ne
hanthey man ul (you to only AC) ‘only to you’ (object), and ape-nim kkey man uy
cinci (father-HT to only GN meal) ‘the meal only to father’ (genitive).","[342, 343]"
"
9.3             Syntactic relations
Syntactic relations among various constituents in simplex and complex sentences may
be observed in terms of the overall syntactic structure. The relations between an
embedded clause and its head are expressed by various clause enders, each of which
consists of one or more inflectional suffixes, and certain connective particles (e.g.,
quotative particle ko), while the relations among nominals or between a nominal and
its clause-mate predicate (verb or adjective) are represented by particles that carry
various case functions (e¢.g., nominative, accusative, dative, locative, ablative, source,
goal, instrument, and directional). Clause embedding will be discussed in 9.4, and
case relations in 9.5. The syntactic structure of Korean may be represented in terms of
traditional grammatical categories as in the following set of constituent structure rules.
These rules are not exhaustive, but they do cover most of the essential constituents of
Korean sentences.

The above set of rules shows the basic syntactic structure underlying all grammatical
utterances of Korean. It is simply a basic skeletal scheme. Needless to say, in order to
generate      actual sentences      based on the above              rules, a wide      variety of morpho-
syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic co-occurrence restrictions must be observed.
    Rule (60a) states that a sentence in a discourse (DS) may optionally begin with one
or more discourse-sensitive sentential adverbials (ADV) such as exclamations, time or
place adverbials, address terms, and modal adverbials and end with one or more
delimiters (DEL)         such as the polite particle yo, the apperceptive particle kulye
‘indeed’, the sentence-final plural particle tu/, and the conjunctive particle man(un)
‘but’. Utterances like aiko tahaynghi ipen ey nun Yongho ka sihem ey hapkyekhay-ss-
sup-ni-ta yo! ‘Oh, fortunately Yongho passed the exam this time’ illustrate Rule (60a).
   The first expansion of Rule (60b) accounts for multiple nominative constructions
as well as conjunctive sentence structure in Korean. It indicates that a sentence (S)
may take one or more hierarchical noun phrases (NP) and/or one or more conjunctive
clauses (S-CNJ) before the main clause (S). The recursiveness of topic nominals
(sentential     subjects)      and conjunctive          clauses    is handled      by embedding     S within
another S.
   In the second expansion, Rule (60b) also shows that a sentence                               is minimally
composed of one noun phrase which functions as the subject and one predicative verb
phrase     (VP).     Despite     some      linguists’     claims    that    Korean     is a so-called      non-
configurational language where the nominal arguments of a sentence are equally
related to the predicate and thus not hierarchical, the present study distinguishes the
subject from the other nominal arguments. Notionally, the subject nominal is ‘what is
being talked about’ or ‘what the sentence is about’ while the remaining arguments and
their verb or adjective simply predicate the subject, denoting ‘what is being said about
the subject’. Syntactically, almost all Korean sentences must have an explicit or
implicit subject while the other arguments and adjuncts are largely optional.
Moreover, as observed in 9.2.8, constructions like copular, locational, and sensory
sentences require the subject to appear in the sentence-initial position. Lastly, only the
subject can trigger subject honorification, and reflexive pronouns usually agree only
with the subject.
   Rule (60c) expands a verb phrase into ZERO                        or more noun phrases (NP*) and a
lower-level        verb phrase     (V').     Postulating NP*,         all of which       are related    to the
predicate     (V')     in terms     of cases      such     as dative,      goal,   source,   instrument,    and
accusative, implies that Korean has a flat syntactic structure of non-subject arguments.
This flatness is particularly reflected in the allowance of free scrambling among pre-
predicate constituents,
   Rule (60d) is an expansion of a lower-level verb phrase. First, V' — NP V'
accounts for the occurrence of multiple object constructions. The NP before V' is
300               The Korean languagealways accusative-marked, as in Yongho ka so lul [kkoli lul cap-ass-ta|                                         ‘Yongho
seized the cow by the tail’ and na nun Allasukha lul [kwukyeng ul hay-ss-e) ‘I saw the
sights of Alaska’ where the first accusative particle /u/ is derived from Rule (60c) and
the second /u/ from Rule (60d).
      The second expansion of V’ accounts for the optional occurrence of a complement
clause    (CC),    one or more               constituent     adverbials      (ADV*)      modifying       the verb or
adjective (V), and the obligatory occurrence of V and its one or more inflectional
suffixes (SUF*). As discussed in 8.4, the sentence-ender and clause-ender suffixes are
obligatory in occurrence, while pre-terminal suffixes are not.
   Rule (60e) presents the structure of a complement clause. A complement clause,
which may be followed by a delimiter (DEL), consists of a clause (S) and a
complementizer (CMP) such as the infinitive -e/-a or the adverbializer -key, as in
emeni nun Mia eykey [sakwa lul sa-key man) hay-ss-ta ‘Mother caused Mia only to
buy apples’ where the adverbializer -key is a complementizer and the particle man is a
delimiter. One unique subset of complement clause is the quotative construction,
which is composed of a clause (S) and a quotative particle (QT). In Yongho nun [nay
ka haksayng i-nya| ko man mul-ess-e.yo “Yongho only asked whether I am a student’,
the bracketed part is S, ke is QT, and man is DEL. Recall that a clause before QT
takes the form of a complete sentence in the neutral speech level.
    Rule (60f) depicts the overall structure of Korean noun phrases (NP). Noun phrases
are of two types. One consists of a noun stem (N), optionally preceded by one or more
relative clauses (RC*), genitive phrases (GNP*), and/or determiners (DET*) and/or
followed by a plural suffix (PL). Determiners include demonstratives (e.g., i ‘this’),
quantifiers (e.g., twu ‘two’) and qualifiers (e.g., say ‘new’). The other noun phrase
type involves nominalized clauses (S NOM). For instance, in na nun [Mia ka ka-ss-
um] ul al-ass-ta ‘1 knew that Mia had gone’, the bracketed part is a nominalized
clause where           -wm    is a nominalizer suffix. These                 two types of constructions are
optionally    followed           by        semantic   and/or    syntactic      case     particles,     one     or     more
delimiters (DEL""*), as illustrated in (61a) and (61b).

                    ‘In my observation also, Milan is diligent.’   The order among the pre-nominal modifiers given in Rule (60f) is a neutral one.
Except for the qualifier determiners (e.g., say ‘new’, oyn ‘left-side’), which must
appear immediately before N, these pre-nominal modifiers can be scrambled rather
freely,   as discussed      in 9.2.8.   Post-nominal          elements,    on    the    other   hand,   have     a
relatively fixed order in the sequence of plural suffix, ‘semantic’ case particle,
delimiter particle, and ‘syntactic’ case particle. For instance, in haksayng-tul eykey
man ul cwu-ess-ta ‘(1) gave (them) only to students’, -fu/ is a plural suffix, eykey ‘to’
is a dative (semantic) case particle, man              ‘only’ is a delimiter particle, and ui is an
accusative (syntactic) case particle.
   More than one relative clause (RC*) or genitive construction (GNP*) may modify
a head nominal, as illustrated in (62).

                    “Tonghwan’s ten books’
   Rule (60g) is the expansion of a genitive phrase into a noun phrase (NP) and the
genitive case particle uy (GN). Frequently, the genitive particle uy is omitted in
utterances if no ambiguity or semantic anomaly is thereby caused, as in ce salam (uy)
nolay ‘that person’s songs’ and Sewul (*uy) salam ‘a person living in Seoul’. It
cannot, however,     be omitted         if the noun phrase has a particle, as in na man                        uy
sayngkak (I only GN idea) ‘only my idea’.
   As noticed in [Puk.kyeng ulo puthe man] uy phyenci (Peking DR from only GN
letter) ‘letters only from (the direction of) Peking’, one or more semantic case and
delimiter particles may         occur (as NP         elements) before the genitive particle. No
syntactic case particle (i.e., nominative ka/i and accusative (/)u/) may occur before the
genitive particle which is also a syntactic case particle.
   Since a genitive phrase may embed another genitive recursively, (60f) and (60g)
accommodate recursiveness by allowing the NP in (60g) to reapply in (60f). This
recursiveness may be demonstrated as in (63).

(lit. ‘a person (whose) height is big’); [panana lul mek-nu-n] salam-tul ‘those people

9.1              Structural essentialsKorean is predicate-final, sharing the typical properties of predicate-final languages,
such as Japanese, and very different from languages like English and Chinese. Thus,
the predicate (verb or adjective) expression always comes at the end of a clause,
whether the clause is a main (matrix) or embedded one.
      Korean is also a head-final Janguage and so dependent elements usually precede
their heads. All modifiers, whether they are adjectives, adverbs, numerals, relative or
complement           clauses,   subordinate   or coordinate     clauses,      determiners,      or genitive
constructions, must precede the element they modify.
      Case,   conjunctive,      and   delimiter particles are all postpositional;              titles follow
names; an ‘auxiliary’ predicate follows the ‘main’ predicate; tense-aspect and
modality elements follow the verbal stem in the form of inflectional suffixes; and
various sentence or clause types are expressed by a sentence or clause ender which is
suffixed to the predicate. The comparative expression takes the order: standard +
comparative particle + degree adverb + adjective/adverb as in Mia pota te yeyppu-
n/yeyppu-key ‘prettier than Mia’.
      Like    many      other predicate-final    languages,     there   are    no   articles    or relative
pronouns, and there is no movement of a wh-element or inversion of any kind in
question sentences. Sentence (1) illustrates many of these structural characteristics.
 266              The Korean language (1)              [cey ka     pangkum cap-un]              [khu-n]       kokilul     _ po-sy-ess-e.yo?
                   I     NM justnow         catch-RL       big-RL       fishAC       — see-SH-PST-POL
                  ‘Did (you) see the big fish I caught just now?’
       Notice   in (1) that in both the embedded              (bracketed)        and main      (unbracketed)
 clauses, the verb stem cap ‘catch’, the adjective stem khu ‘be big’, and the verb stem
 po ‘see’ appear at the end of their respective clauses; the tense-aspect and modality
 suffixes -(u)n (past relativizer in verbs and non-past relativizer in adjectives), -sy
 (subject honorific), -ess (past/perfect), and -e.yo (polite ender) are attached to their
 respective predicate stems; the two bracketed relative clauses are placed before the
 head noun koki ‘fish’; the time adverb pangkum ‘just now’ precedes the head verb
 stem cap ‘catch’; both the nominative and accusative case particles ka and /ul are
’ postpositional; and no article or relative pronoun appears in the sentence.
       Due   to the predicate-final requirement,           the omission      or ‘gapping’         of repeated
 predicates     in conjunctive       constructions takes place         in the backward          direction, as
 opposed to English, which allows gapping only in forward direction. (2)              emma      nun     insam    (tu-si-ko),       appa     nun nok.yong            tu-sey-yo.
                  mom       TC _    ginseng take-SH-and dad             TC       dear-antler take-SH-POL
                  ‘Mom takes ginseng tonic and dad (takes) dear-antler tonic.’
                  (lit. ‘Mom (takes) ginseng tonic and dad takes dear-antler tonic.’)       Korean has a large number of postpositional case and delimiter particles and
 predicate suffixes that are responsible for a wide variety of syntactic and semantic
 functions. Sentences (1) and (2) illustrate that various particles and predicate suffixes
 are agglutinated       to their head       words   to perform        relevant     syntactic    functions.   In
 particular, conjunctive, relative, and complement clauses, as well as honorification,
 tense-aspect, modality, and sentence types, are expressed by means                            of inflectional
 suffixes.
       Korean allows reordering or ‘scrambling’ among pre-predicate nominal elements
 only with slight connotative           differences    in terms       of topicality or focus. That is,
 probably due to the productive use of case particles, nominal elements indicating
 grammatical      functions       such as time, subject, direct and              indirect object,    location,
 source, goal, instrument, and direction may be scrambled rather freely in syntactic
 ordering. This will be discussed in 9.2.8. Scrambling also occurs among pre-nominal
 elements such as relative clauses, genitive phrases, and determiners (9.3).
       Korean allows sentential elements that are predictable from the discourse context
 or situation to be omitted. That is, any nominal construction that is contextually or
 situationally recoverable is usually not expressed at all, unless it is to be particularly
                 9 Grammatical structure                                                                   267
delimited, focused, or topicalized. There are no dummy elements that are comparable
to the English deontic if or there whose                        sole purpose      is to show   grammatical
functions. In sentence (1), for instance, the subject of the main clause that refers to the
addressee     ‘you’   is left out because it is recoverable from the speech situation.
Moreover, antecedents of an anaphor such as ce ‘self (plain), caki ‘self’ (neutral),
tangsin ‘self (deferential), or a ZERO pronoun are frequently found in the discourse
context, rather than in actual text, as illustrated in (3).","[281, 282, 283]"

    The indirect object of a dative verb (e.g., cwuta ‘give’, kaluchita ‘teach’) and the
goal of a locomotive verb (e.g., kafa ‘go’) are usually marked by a static locative
particle. If particular emphasis for exclusiveness is intended, however, it can be
marked by an accusative particle as in (1 14a, b). Also, an accusative particle alternates
with a directional particle (u)j/o before certain transitive verbs as in (114c) (cf. 9.5.3).

                    ‘My older brother wanted to smoke.’
   The two constructions of (115a) can be bracketed as nay ka ku say lul (cwuk-key]
hay-ss-ta and nay ka [ku say ka cwuk-key] hay-ss-ta. This dual bracketing is also true
with (115b), as in Yongho nun Mia lul [papo la] ko sayngkak.ha-y and Yongho nun
[Mia ka papo la] ko sayngkak.ha-y. In desiderative sentences, the accusative-marked
nominal is associated with the transitive verb (e.g., phiwuta ‘smoke’), whereas the
nominative-marked nominal is related to the emotive adjective siphta ‘wish’, as in
hyeng un [tampay lul phiwu-ko] siph-ess-ta and hyeng un tampay ka [phiwu-ko] siph-
ess-ta, respectively.
   The   nominative        or        accusative           particle      may       occur        for        emphasis     after   the
nominalizer suffix -ci in negative sentences if the nominalized clause is an adjective
or intransitive verb construction as in (116a, b). When                                   the embedded               clause of a
negative construction has a transitive verb, only the accusative particle is optionally
allowed, as in (116c, d).

                     *Yongho helped Mia (for her).’
   In a clause- or sentence-final position, the accusative particle and the preceding
noun kes ‘fact’ are compounded to mark an antithetical clause, with senses such as ‘I
wish’, ‘I think’, ‘I should have done’, and ‘despite the fact that’. The compound kes u/
or its contracted form ke-/ may have developed from kes ul kaciko ‘with the fact that’,
with the deletion of kaciko ‘with’ (< kaci-ko ‘have-and’). This grammaticalized form
of the accusative particle has nothing to do with a case or delimiter function.

                     ‘I visited Milan, despite the fact that she doesn’t like it.’
      The genitive case which connects one noun phrase to a head noun is marked by the
particle wy, although the particle is frequently omitted. The genitive phrase has various
semantic relations with regard to the head, including possession as in Milan.i uy
kwutwu ‘Milan’s leather shoes’), relationship as in ne uy eppa ‘your older brother’,
              9 Grammatical structure                                                  333
authorship as in J Kwangswu uy Salang “Yi Kwangsu’s book Love’, classification as
in twu chay uy cip (2 CL GN house) ‘two houses’, pertinence as in tokse uy kyeycel ‘a
season for reading’, origin as in Mikwuk uy soykoki ‘beef from America’, location as
in Hocwu uy inkwu ‘the population of Australia’, and reference as in kaul uy nolay ‘a
song of autumn’. In addition, when the head word is a verbal or adjectival noun, the
relation is that of an argument and a predicate, as in pesu uy chwulpal ‘the departure
of the bus’ [subject—verb], Alan.i uy hayngpok ‘Alan’s happiness’ [subject—adjective],
llakhu uy phakoy ‘the destruction of Iraq’ [subject—verb; verb—object], and Nam Puk
uy thongil ‘unification of South and North Korea’ [subject-verb; verb—object]. The
genitive particle in most of these constructions may be omitted in casual speech.
    The genitive case may incorporate various thematic roles that the genitive nominal
has in relation to the head nominal, as in Mikwuk uy Ilpon kwa uy Thayphyengyang
eyse uy cencayng ‘America’s war against Japan in the Pacific Ocean’ where Mikwuk
‘America’ functions as agent, //pon ‘Japan’, comitative, and Thayphyengyang ‘the
Pacific Ocean’,    dynamic    locative in relation to the verbal   noun   cencayng   ‘war’.
Notice that semantic case particles such as comitative and dynamic locative in this
example are intact, cooccurring with uy. Only the other syntactic case particles
(nominative and accusative) are obligatorily omitted before the genitive uy, hence
*Mikwuk i uy and *Mikwuk ul uy are ungrammatical.
   When   a nominal     in the genitive case contains case or delimiter particles, the
genitive particle also must occur. Thus, in Sewul lo puthe uy phyenci (Seoul DR from
GN) ‘a letter from Seoul’, uy must occur. Similarly, when a noun phrase in the
genitive case consists of conjoined nominals as in ne wa na uy chai-cem ‘differences
between you and me’ or a clause with a sentence ender as in cwuk-nu-nya sa-nu-nya
uy cencayng ‘a war of whether to live or die’, uy cannot be deleted.","[346, 347, 348, 349]"

9.2.3           Verb sentencesThe simplest form of verb sentences is an intransitive type consisting of a subject in
the nominative case and a verb, optionally accompanied by one or more modifiers or
adjuncts.(17)          a.    appa ka emma hako caknyen ilpon ey pay lo ka-sy-ess-e.yo.
                    dad NM mom with last year Japanto ship by go-SH-PST-POL
                    ‘My dad went to Japan with my mom by boat last year.’              b.    Inho    nun        kamki     ttaymun          ey        cip     — eyse_—s   swii-e. yo.
                    Inho    TC         cold      due              to        home       at       rest-POL
                    ‘Inho is resting at home due to a cold.’
   Another intransitive type comprises simple sentences with two nominative cases.
One such subtype includes inchoative (change of state) sentences where a subject and
a complement,      both    in the nominative            case, occur with          the inchoative      verb foyta
‘become’ as in (18a). Another subtype consists of experiencer~—theme sentences as in
(18b). Verbs in this category include tu/ta ‘suffer from’ (lit. ‘enter’) and nata ‘appear’.
Both the experiencer noun (subject) and the theme noun are in the nominative case.
(18)          a.    Kim-kwun           i       mikwuk     eyse     kyoswu           ka _ toy-ess-e.

                    ‘Mr Kim became a professor in America.’
278             The Korean language                b.   hal.apeci           ka          kamki           ka           {u-Sy-eSS-€.yo.

                     ‘Grandpa caught a cold.’   A third intransitive type contains a verb that denotes reciprocity and a nominal
marked by the comitative particle (k)wa/hako ‘and, with’. When the comitative-
marked nominal follows the nominative-marked subject, only the ‘with’ interpretation
is possible as in (19a); otherwise both ‘with’ and ‘and’ interpretations are possible as
in (19b).(19)            a.   Nami          ka         enni           wa                SSAW-€SS-€.YO.

                     ‘My older sister and the doctor kissed.” or
                     ‘The doctor kissed my older sister.’      A fourth intransitive type consists of passive sentences where a passive or pseudo-
passive verb occurs with a ‘patient’ subject in the nominative case and an ‘agent’
nominal in the locative case marked by eykey or hanthey in the sense of ‘by’. If the
action denoted by a passive verb affects only a part of the patient’s body or a thing
belonging to the patient, that body part or thing can be expressed as an object in the
accusative case.(20)            a.   totwuk        i          swunkyeng             eykey          (phal ul) cap-hi-ess-ta.

                     ‘My friend was spanked by his father.’      A fifth intransitive type is that of nominative—dative/locative, where verbs like

                      ‘My friend has fallen ill.’       Several types of transitive verb sentences exist, allowing adjuncts and modifiers to
occur optionally. The most productive type consists of a subject and an object in the
nominative and accusative cases, respectively.
(22)             hyeng       i           kukcang        eyse   nay    chinkwu      lul      manna-ss-e.

                 ‘My older brother met my friend at the theatre.’Korean transitive verbs normally do not allow a subject to be an inanimate noun. In
writings such as literary works, however, nouns like pihayngki ‘airplane’, hwacay
‘fire’, hongswu ‘flood’, kanan ‘poverty’, and cencayng ‘war’ are often used as the
subject. Even then, such words carry a metaphorical sense of personification.
    Another transitive type consists of verbs that occur with nominals in the
nominative, accusative, and source cases. This includes not only receiving verbs such
as pat.ta ‘receive’ and tang-hata ‘undergo’ but also certain passive verbs like cap-hita
‘be caught’ and palp-hita ‘be stepped on’. The agentive source particle is
eykey(se)/hanthey(se) for verbs of receiving as in (23a), but eykey/hanthey for passive
verbs as in (23b).
(23)             a.   na nun ce cemwen eykey(se) changphilul                              tanghay-ss-e.yo.

280              The Korean language      A third transitive type involves ditransitive verbs such as cwuta ‘give’ (plain),
tulita ‘give’ (humble), kaluchita ‘teach’, cisihata ‘direct’, and ceysihata ‘show’. This
type has direct and indirect objects. Here also belong ditransitive causative verbs like
po-ita ‘show’, ip-hita ‘dress (someone)’, and mek-ita ‘feed (someone)’,(24)             a.    apeci     nun        halmeni       eykey             ton           ul          _tuli-sy-ess-e.yo.

                       ‘Nami showed a picture of herself to Inho.’       Another ditransitive type is characterized by double accusative cases.
(25)             a.    hyeng          i       kay        lul               kkoli         lul    — cap-ass-e.

                       ‘Father gave money to grandmar.’      (25a) is a case of macro—micro (kay vs. kkoli) relation. (25b) is a case of separating
a verbal noun from Aata. As for (25c), when occurring with a donatory verb such as
cwuta      or tulita   ‘give’,    a dative          nominal               with      eykey/hanthey             (neutral)     or kkey
(honorific) ‘to’ can be accusativized for focus, resulting in two accusative particles in
that sentence or clause.
   Notice in (25b) that consonant-final given names such as Milan are followed by the
vowel i, This was discussed in 8.1.2.","[293, 294, 295, 296]"

8.3.5           Determiner derivationSome verbs and adjectives have been fossilized into determiners with the relativizer
(RL) suffix -(ujn. This suffix is basically an inflectional one, but functions as a
derivational suffix in the formation of determiners.

8.4             Inflectional morphology
8.4.1           Inflectional categories
The     agglutinative    nature of Korean     is distinctly reflected     in its abounding       in
inflectional suffixes that are attached to predicate stems. Nominal              case particles
behave like inflectional suffixes, but they are regarded as words in this volume, as
they are more word-like than suffix-like. That is, they are frequently omittable,
loosely associated with nominals, and can occur after a clause as in [nwu ka ka-nu-
nya] ka muncey i-ta ‘Who is going, that is the problem’ where the bold-faced
nominative case particle takes the whole preceding clause as its domain. Thus, case
particles will be discussed in the chapter on syntax (9.5).
      The only suffix which may be considered inflectional in nouns is the plural -fu/,
although it also functions as a defective noun (e.g., so, mal, kay, tul ‘cows, horses,
dogs, ete.’; 8.1.2) and a particle (see below; 8.1.9). As a suffix, as in haksayng-tul
‘students’, it has various inflectional properties. It carries the grammatical meaning of
plurality, does not change the word category of the cooccurring noun, does not
contribute to word formation, is used productively after nouns and pronouns, and is of
232              The Korean language‘outer-formation’. For instance, in the noun no/-um-kkwun-tul ‘gamblers’, the verb
root nol ‘play’ and the derivational suffix -um (nominalizer) form a noun root nol-um
‘gambling’, to which another derivational suffix -kkwun                 ‘person’   is attached. The
suffix -tul is attached to the whole noun no/l-um-kkwun. More examples follow,(25)             a.    Nouns:           kacok-tul ‘family members’
                                        kKilum-tul ‘different kinds of oil’
                                        kyoswu-nim-tul (professor-HT-PL) ‘professors’                 b.    Pronouns:        wuli-tul (we-PL) ‘we’ (plain)
                                        ce-huy-tul (I-group-PL) ‘we’ (humble)
                                        tangsin-tul ‘you’ (blunt)
      The words belonging to the categories of numerals, determiners, adverbs, and
particles do not inflect even           in plurality. Although      ku-tul ‘they’ consists of the
demonstrative determiner and the plural suffix, this ku functions as a third person
pronoun. Similarly, although the adverb construction ppalli tul ‘quickly’ is acceptable,
the plural fu/ in this case is a particle (not a suffix) denoting the plurality of the
understood subject, as in ppalli tul o-sey-yo ‘Please come quickly, you all!’
      In verbs and adjectives, on the other hand, there are scores of inflectional suffixes,
Inflectional suffixes follow derivational ones in morphological constructions, as in
cap-hi-si-ess-sup-ni-ta ‘(a respectable person) was caught’, where cap-hi ‘be caught’
is the stem consisting of the transitive verb root cap- ‘catch’ and the passive
derivational suffix -Ai, and the rest are all inflectional suffixes: -si (subject honorific
SH), -ess (past/perfect PST), -sup (addressee honorific AH), -ni (indicative mood IN),
and -fa (declarative suffix DC).
      As   for the    inflectional   suffixes   for verbs   and   adjectives,   it is necessary   to
distinguish between enders and non-terminal suffixes, in that enders such as sentence
enders (e.g., plain interrogative ender -ni?, deferential declarative ender -sup-ni-ta),
conjunctive enders (e.g., -ko ‘and’, -myense ‘while’), and adnominal (relative clause)
enders (e.g., non-past indicative -mu-n) occur at the end of a sentence or a clause and
must be present in order for a verb or adjective to stand independently. Thus, for
instance, the verb stem mek ‘eat’ is never used alone in utterances. It must be followed
by an ender, as in mek-sup-ni-ta, mek-nun-ta, mek-ko, mek-nu-n, etc. Furthermore,
enders take the syntactic role of relating the whole preceding clause either to the main
clause (when they occur in subordinate clauses) or to the discourse (when they occur
in main clauses).
      Non-terminal inflectional suffixes lack these features, being optional in occurrence
in positions before the enders. They are, however, distinguished from derivational

suffixes in that, like enders, they (1) always follow derivational suffixes, if any, in a
predicate   construction,      (ii)   carry     grammatical    meanings,      such    as_   honorific,
tense/aspect, and modal, (iii) occur with all types of verbs and adjectives, without
changing the word category of the stem, and (iv) do not participate in new word
formation. The sequential morphological structure of non-terminal suffixes and enders
may be summarized as follows. Optional non-terminal elements occur strictly in the
order given, following the stem which may have one or more derivational suffixes.","[247, 248, 249]"

1.5.7         SOV syntax    Korean, like Japanese, is an SOV language. That is, it is a predicate-final language
with the basic word order of Subject—-Object—Predicate. In normal speech, the
predicate (verb or adjective) comes at the end of a sentence or a clause, while all other
elements, including the subject and object, must appear before the predicate. Korean
particles (equivalent to English prepositions) always occur after the elements they are
associated with. Thus, Korean particles are all postpositions. Also, all modifying
elements such as determiners, adjectives, phrases, and clauses precede the elements
they modify, as illustrated in nay ka tani-nu-n hak.kyo (I NM                  attend-IN-RL school)
‘the school that I attend’.
   In Korean,       although    the subject tends to appear first in a sentence             in normal
situations,    it and   the    other   major   constituents    preceding      the   predicate   can   be
scrambled rather freely for emphatic or other figurative purposes, as long as the
predicate retains the final position.
   Korean is often called a situation- or discourse-oriented language, in that
contextually or situationally understood elements (including subject and object) are
left unexpressed more frequently than not. Thus, for instance, in eti ka-sey-yo? (where
go-SH-POL)        ‘Where are you going?’, the subject does not appear. Using a word
denoting ‘you’ in this expression would sound awkward in normal contexts, unless
‘you’ is emphasized or contrasted with someone else, as in ‘as for you’.
16              The Korean language     Korean,   like Japanese, is a ‘macro-to-micro’         language,       in that the universe is
represented    in the order of a set (macro)       and then its members             (micro),    Thus,   for
instance, Koreans say or write the family name first and then the given name followed
by a title; say or write an address in the order of country, province, city, street, house
number, and personal name; and refer to time with year first and seconds last. So-
called multiple subject (or topic) constructions also follow the ‘macro-to-micro’ order,
as in nay ka kho ka khu-ta (I NM nose NM big-DC) ‘T have a big nose.’
1.5.8           HonorificsKorean is an honorific language, in that sentences can hardly be uttered without the
speaker’s approximate knowledge of his social relationship with his addressee and
referent in terms of age category (adult, adolescent, or child), social status, kinship, in-
or Out-groupness, and/or the speech act situation. The grammatical pattern of Korean
honorifics seems to be the most systematic among all known languages. Honorific
forms appear in the following categories: address-reference terms (e.g., Kim kyoswu
[plain]   vs. Kim    kyoswu-nim     [hon.]   ‘professor Kim’);      nouns     and     verbs    (e.g., pap
[plain] vs. cinci [hon.] ‘rice, meal’; cata [plain] vs. cwumusita                 [hon.] ‘sleep’; issta
[plain] vs. kyeysita [hon.] ‘stay, exist’); pronouns (e.g., na [plain] vs. ce [humble] ‘I’);
case particles (e.g., ka/i [neutral] vs. kkeyse [hon.] (nominative)); verbal suffixes (e.g.,
ZERO      [plain] vs. -(u)si [hon.] (subject honorific); ZERO             [plain] vs. -(su)p [hon.]
(addressee     honorific)),   and   six   speech   levels   based    on     the     speaker—addressee
perspective    (e.g., declarative   sentence   enders   such   as deferential         level    -(su)pnita,
polite level -e.yo or -a.yo, blunt level -so or -o, familiar level -ney, intimate level -e or
-a, and plain level -ta). Non-verbal behavior parallels the above-mentioned
hierarchical verbal expressions. For instance, one bows to a senior person such as
one’s professor when greeting or leave-taking. The senior person does not bow to a
junior. An in-group junior is not supposed to smoke in front of a senior person.
     All the above salient features of the Korean language will be elaborated in great
detail in the relevant chapters that follow.
              2              Genetic affiliation
This chapter surveys several major hypotheses on the prehistory and genetic affiliation
of Korean. While Korean proper names in the main body are romanized according to
the Yale system, the phonemic           forms of Korean     and other languages, whether
contemporary, ancient, or reconstructed, are transcribed by and large with the IPA
system for comparative purposes.","[31, 32, 33]"

8.1             Word categories
8.1.1           Classification
The Korean lexicon becomes richer, due not only to extensive borrowings but also to
productive coinages of new words through derivational processes such as affixation,
compounding, abbreviation, and contraction. In addition, Korean predicates (verbs
and adjectives) conjugate productively by means of a wide variety of inflectional
suffixes.
      In order to examine the word structure and word-formational processes in Korean,
it is essential to determine what kinds of significant lexical-functional categories of
words are to be recognized. Linguists disagree on this issue. H.P. Choy (1971)
proposes ten categories, North Korean grammar books eight, and some others more or
less. For instance, Choy (ibid.:198) establishes ten categories based on form, function,
and meaning: noun, pronoun, numeral, verb, adjective, copula, determiner, adverb,
interjection, and particle. To Choy’s scheme, W. Huh (1984:193) adds the category of
conjunctor which includes fossilized compounds such as kuliko ‘and’, kulena ‘but’,
and kulemulo ‘therefore’, which are assigned to the category of adverb in Choy. On
the other hand, North Korean grammars (e.g., Kwahak.wen               1960) establish eight
categories: noun, numeral, pronoun, verb, adjective, article, adverb, and interjection.
In H.M. Sohn (1994), seven categories are proposed: noun, pronoun, verb, adjective,
204             The Korean languagedeterminer, adverb, and particle. It is common practice among Korean linguists and
lexicographers to set up an independent numeral category, and so in this volume, the
following     eight     categories   and    their    subcategories     are   established     based   on
morphosyntactic and semantic properties.  (1)           a.    NOUN:                Proper, Counter, Defective, Verbal, Adjectival,
                                           Common
                b.    PRONOUN:             Personal, Reflexive, Reciprocal, Interrogative-
                                           Indefinite, Demonstrative
                c.    NUMERAL:        _    Native, Sino-Korean, Loan
                d.    VERB:                Main/Auxiliary, Transitive/Intransitive
                e.    ADJECTIVE:           Copula, Existential, Sensory, Descriptive
                f.    DETERMINER:          Demonstrative, Qualifier, Quantifier
                g.    ADVERB:              Negative, Attributive, Modal, Conjunctive,
                                           Discoursal
                h.    PARTICLE:            Case, Delimiter, Conjunctive
In this volume, the term nominal is used to encompass noun, pronoun, and numeral
and the term predicate to encompass                 verb and adjective in view of their shared
grammatical properties.","[219, 220]"
"8.1.9              ParticlesParticles are postpositional function words that either indicate the syntactic relation of
the cooccurring element with other constituents of the sentence, delimit the meaning
of the element to which they are attached, or perform some other function such as
                 8 Word structure                                                                          213
plurality, conjunction, quotation, or politeness. As postpositions, particles follow a
nominal (noun, pronoun, or numeral), a nominal phrase or nominalized clause, an
adverb or adverbialized clause, or a sentence.
   There are some phonological grounds for particles to be equated with suffixes. No
phonological word boundary exists before a particle but only an affixal boundary, as
observed in os [ot] ‘clothes’ vs. os i [o.si] ‘clothes (subject)’, where i is a nominative
case particle. Notice that s in os is not changed to [t] before the particle i, unlike the
case in os an [o.tan] ‘inside of the clothes’ where s is changed to [t] before the word
boundary.     Indeed, the class of particles borders between a word                             category and a
suffixal category in its phonological and morphosyntactic behaviour. However, we
will follow tradition and give particles a separate word category status. One syntactic
reason in favour of treating them as words is that they occur not only after a nominal
but also after a verb, an adverb, a clause, or even a full-fledged sentence. In cwuk-nu-
nya sa-nu-nya ka muncey ta ‘To die or live is the problem’, tul-e o-sey-yo tul ‘Come
in, you all’, and pi o-n-ta ko malhay-ss-ta ‘He said it was raining’, the nominative
particle ka, the plural particle tu/, and the quotative particle ko occur after a sentence.
      Korean particles may be grouped into three types: (i) case particles, which mark
the syntactic relation of a nominal element with its coocurring predicate or with
another nominal (as in genitive or connective constructions) or the discourse relation
of a nominal element (denoting the addressee) with a main sentence (as in vocative
constructions);     (ii) delimiters,         which         delimit   the      meanings     of the cooccurring
elements; and (iii) conjunctive particles, which conjoin two or more clauses. These
three types are illustrated in the sentence in (8).(8)             apecika       ne       thako     na          man     nol-la        ko      ha-si-ess-e.

                        (1)            (i)                   (il)                  (iii)
                  ‘Father said that only you and I can play.’
      Case particles are of the kinds given in (9). Of the slashed pair, the form before the
slash occurs after a vowel, and the one following the slash, after a consonant. (AN)
stands for animates only, (IN) for inanimates only, and (hon.) for honorific.","[228, 229]"

9.5.2         Dative, locative, goal, and sourceParticles marking dative, locative, goal, and source cases are as follows.

      Notice that dative, static locative, and goal cases on the one hand, and dynamic
locative and source cases on the other, are marked by the same kinds of particles,
except that the latter set contains the fossilized morpheme -se, whose meaning may be
equated     with        ‘inception’    or ‘dynamicity’. Needless              to say, use of different case
particles is correlated with the different predicates used, as illustrated in (119).

                          ‘Alan went to the teacher.’
      As in (119a), the dative case occurs with ditransitive verbs that take both direct and
indirect objects (e.g., cwuta ‘give’, poita ‘show’, kaluchita ‘teach’, myenglyenghata
‘order’, pokohata            ‘report’, allita ‘inform’), As in (119b), the static locative case
occurs with existential, static, and passive predicates (e.g., manhta                              ‘be much’, issta
‘exist, stay’, salta ‘live’, namta ‘remain’, kellita ‘get caught’, palphita ‘be stepped
on’). The goal case occurs not only with movement verbs (e.g., kata ‘go’, ofa ‘come’,
fanita ‘go to and from’, o/uta ‘climb’), as in (119c), but also with non-dative transitive
              9 Grammatical structure                                                                      335
verbs (e.g., ponayta ‘send’, nohta ‘put’, chilhata ‘paint’, ssuta ‘write’, moita ‘gather’,
ancta ‘sit’). These three cases, represented by the same set of particles, share the
semantic component [GOAL], in that a theme (in the nominative or accusative case) is
oriented to the referent of a nominal. Therefore, these particles may be termed goal-
oriented locative particles.
   The distinction between          dynamic      location       and   source      cases     is made     by the
predicates used.
(120)         a.   Yongho     nun      hak.kyo      eyse          nol-ass-ta.             (dynamic locative)

                   “Yongho played at school.’              b.   Cihwan.i    nun      hak.kyo          eyse    w-ass-ta.                            (source)

                   *‘Cihwan came from school.’
Notice that the dynamic locative case occurs with activity verbs (e.g., nolta ‘play’,
cata ‘sleep’) and the source case with movement verbs (e.g., kata ‘go’, ota ‘come’,
pat.ta ‘receive’). These two cases, marked by the same set of particles, share the
semantic component [SOURCE] in that a theme (in the nominative case) is originated
from the referent of a nominal. They may be termed source-oriented locative particles.
Thus, unlike in English, the difference between static locative and dynamic locative is
more important than the distinction between dative/goal and locative.
   Static locative particles are also used to denote the locations of time (e.g., yel si ey
cata ‘sleep at 10 o’clock’), age (e.g., phal-sip sey ey tolaka-sita ‘die at the age of 80’),
proportion (e.g., chen wen ey twu kay ‘2 items for 1,000 won’), reference (e.g.,
kenkang ey cohta ‘be good for one’s health’), agent (e.g., Kay hanthey mul-lita ‘be
bitten by a dog’), cause (e.g., Kamki ey kel-lita ‘catch a cold’), and addition (e.g., swiul
ey pap ey cal mekta ‘have a good meal with wine and rice’). All these are considered
semantic extensions of the static locative case.
    Many idiomatic phrases are formed with ey: V-ki ey ‘as, because’ (past event) (e.g.,
pi ka o-ki ey ‘because it rained’), N ttaymun ey ‘because’ (e.g., kongpu ttaymun ey
 ‘because of the study’), NV tekpun ey ‘thanks to’ (e.g., emeni tekpun ey ‘thanks to my
mother’), ey piha-ye ‘compared to’ (e.g., nolyek ey piha-ye ‘compared to his effort’),
ey tayha-ye ‘in regard to’ (e.g., kyengcey ey tayha-ye ‘in regard to the economy’), ey
ttal-a ‘per’ (e.g., ne uy yocheng ey ttal-a ‘per your request’), and ey uyha-myen
‘according to’ (e.g., iki yeypo ey uyha-myen ‘according to the weather forecast’).
   The   goal-oriented   particles    can be followed             by the        ‘transferentive’      delimiter
particle ta(ka) for emphasis, if the verb is a transitive one.
336              The Korean language(121)            sensayng-nim              kkey-(ta(ka))           ku      chayk      ul     ponay        tuly-ess-e.
                 teacher-HT        _to               that book                        AC      send         give-PST-INT
                 *(I) sent the book to the teacher.’
   The dative case may be represented colloquially by the particles tele and poko
(derived from po-ko ‘looking at’), in addition to eykey and hanthey, with a verb of
saying (stating and asking).(122)            na       nun      Mia _ eykey/hanthey/tele/poko                    ca-la            ko    hay-ss-ta.
                 I        TC       Mia      to                                      sleep-IM QT            tell-PST-DC
                 ‘I told Mia to sleep.’      The particle eyse can denote a temporal source, as in han si eyse sey si kkaci ‘from
1 to 3 o’clock’. Due to its [SOURCE] component, it is also used as the subject when
the subject denotes a non-human collective agent, such as hak.kyo ‘school’ and thim
‘team’ (123a), and as the source of a superlative expression (123b).
(123)            a.      wuli      thim           il/eyse _ iky-ess-e.
                         our       team          NM/at~        win-PST-INT
                         ‘Our team won.’
                 b.      ku       pan       eyse         Milani         ka         ceyil       yeypp-e.
                         the      class     in           Milan          NM_~       most        pretty-INT
                         ‘Milan is the prettiest in that class.’
      There   are verbs that can occur with both goal- and source-oriented                                          locative
particles.    Such    verbs       include        salta    ‘live’, suta         ‘stand’,     cata     ‘sleep’,     nathanata
‘appear’, mata ‘occur’, phita ‘bloom’, issta ‘exist’, and epsta ‘not exist’. For instance,
in Sewul ey/eyse salta ‘live in Seoul’, there is hardly any semantic difference, except
for the nuance that ey salta gives the feeling of ‘static’ living and eyse salta that of
‘dynamic’      living.         In malwu     ey/eyse seta, the difference                    is clearer,         the ey seta
indicating that the walking action ends on the floor, and the eyse seta indicating that
the standing action takes place on the floor. In the case of (124), the theme is a static
physical object (theatre) in (124a), but an event (movie) in (124b). Thus, we can
distinguish two meanings in isstfa, i.e., static and dynamic location.
(124)            a.      ku       hak.kyo        ey      kukcang           i        iss-e.yo?

                         ‘Is there a theatre in that school?’

               b.   ku       hak.kyo            eyse       yenghwa_              ka _     iss-e.yo?

                    ‘Is there a movie in that school?’
   Another phenomenon is the alternation, without much semantic variation, between
hanthey-se/eykey-se ‘from’ and hanthey/eykey, as in (125a). This occurs when the
nominal has a source meaning and the verb is transitive such as paywuta ‘learn’,
pillita ‘borrow’, pat.ta ‘receive’, tut.ta ‘hear’, and tanghata ‘undergo’. It seems that
hanthey/eykey in such constructions are contracted forms of hahthey-se/eykey-se.
When hanthey/eykey are used as agentive as in (125b), however, such alternation is
not allowed.
(125)          a.   Mia      nun          Cihwan.i             hanthey(-se)           yenge      lul   paywu-n-ta.

                    ‘Mia learns English from Cihwan.’
               b.   ku      totwuk         un         kyengkwan_            eykey(*-se)       cap-hy-ess-e.yo.

                    ‘The thief was caught by the police.’
9.5.3          Directional, instrumental, and functionDirection in the sense of ‘towards, to, for’, instrument in the sense of ‘with, of, by, in’,
and function in the sense of ‘as, for, in the capacity of, in terms of are marked by the
same particle (u)/o. The instrument and function particles have emphatic counterparts
(ujlosse and (u)lose, respectively. Examples of directionals are given in (126).
(126)          a.   Milani          nun         Yengkwuk              ulo         ttena-ss-ta.

Notice that the directional particle (u)/io may be used as a substitute for the accusative
particle. This is particularly common when the direct object is the result of a choice as
in (126d). There is an idiomatic expression with the directional particle that is used as
a temporal adverbial, i.e., aph-ulo ‘in the future’ (lit. ‘towards the front’).
      The instrumental case is extremely polysemic as in chong ulo(sse) capta ‘catch
with a gun’ (instrument), pay lo kata ‘go by boat’ (means), yelsim ulo ilhata ‘work
diligently” (manner), namu lo(sse) cista ‘build with wood’ (material), am ulo cwukta
‘die of cancer’ (cause, reason), sanso wa swuso lo(sse) toyta ‘consist of hydrogen and
oxygen’ (constituency), and ayssu-n tek ulo sengkonghata ‘succeed as a result of hard
work’ (consequence).
   Many idiomatic expressions are formed with the instrumental particle as in the
adverbials hol-/o (single-with) ‘alone’, nal-lo (day-with) ‘by day’, ttay-ttay-lo (time-
time-with) ‘once in a while’, sil-lo (fact-with) ‘in fact’, cengmal-lo (truth-with)
‘truly’, fay-tay-lo (generation-generation-with) “generation to generation’, pothong-
ulo (normality-with)          ‘usually’,       tekthayk-ulo      (favour-with)      ‘thanks   to’, cham-ulo
(truth-with) ‘really’, and isang-ulosse and conjunctive phrases such as (uj/lo inha-ye
‘due to’ and (u)lo malmiam-a ‘because of.
      The function case occurs in constructions like taysa lo(se) kunmuhata ‘work as an
ambassador’, mat ulo(-se) thayenata ‘be born eldest’, and ci/ /o(-se) na yang ulo(-se)
na wuswuhata ‘be excellent in terms of both quality and quantity’.","[349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354]"

              PREFACE
Korean has emerged as an important world language not only for learners of Korean
as a foreign/second language but also for scholars and students of general and Korean
linguistics and for language pedagogists. Thousands of heritage schools, elementary,
intermediate and high schools, colleges and universities, private institutes, and
government agencies around the world offer all levels of Korean language instruction.
The number of institutions offering Korean and consequently, the number of students
learning Korean are both constantly increasing especially in Australia, Europe, China,
Japan, New Zealand, the former Soviet Union, and the United States. An ever-
growing number of general and Korean linguists and linguistic students as well as
language educators are interested in the structure and use of Korean and its universal
and typological features from diachronic, synchronic, and dynamic perspectives,
  In order to meet the immediate needs of linguists working on linguistic universals
and typology as well as students interested in the structure of Korean, I published a
monograph entitled Korean in Routledge’s descriptive grammar series in 1994, This
volume, which consists of syntax, morphology, phonology, ideophones and
interjections, and lexicon, soon became out of print in early 1996. I did not attempt to
have this volume reprinted as I have been working on the current Cambridge volume,
which not only encompasses most of the essential aspects touched upon in Korean but
also widens the horizon by including chapters on genetic affiliation, historical
development, dialects, and writing systems.
   Through theory-neutral description and analysis, the present volume aims to present
most of the major areas of Korean in as simple and widely received terms as possible,
so that the book is accessible to general! readers as well as linguists. | have tried not to
include those recently innovated technical terms which are used only within certain
theoretical frameworks. Such terms would be meaningful only among specialists and
students who keep abreast of the contemporary linguistic trends. Furthermore, in order
to show an unbiased and balanced picture of each major aspect with appropriate
linguistic data, I deliberately avoided discussing controversial theoretical arguments
that have been raised thus far by many recent and contemporary Korean linguists.
xviii          PrefaceInstead, I included in the bibliography an extensive list of works in which a wide
variety of theoretical issues are extensively discussed.
   Thus, this volume is designed and written as a reference book for general and
Korean    linguists   and   Korean   language   pedagogists   and    as   a     textbook   for
undergraduate and graduate students interested in Korean.           It can be used most
profitably for university courses such as Introduction to Korean              Linguistics and
Structure of Korean.
   This volume is a result of my many intermittent years of work at the University of
Hawaii   at Manoa     (UHM)    while teaching the undergraduate      course      Structure of
Korean and the graduate courses History and Dialects of Korean, Korean Phonology
and Morphology, Korean Syntax and Semantics, and Korean Sociolinguistics.
Professor Gerald B. Mathias at UHM read the entire manuscript and provided me with
many valuable comments. Ms Haejin E. Koh, one of my PhD students in Korean
linguistics, gave me admirable editorial assistance. I also appreciate Dr Katharina
Brett, Dr Caroline Murray, and the anonymous reviewer for many essential
corrections, comments, and suggestions invaluable in improving the form and
contents of this volume. I extend my appreciation to the UHM Research Relations
Office and the UHM Center for Korean Studies for each awarding me a grant to help
my research.
   I would like to take this opportunity to specially appreciate Professor Byron W.
Bender who, as my UHM         academic advisor and dissertation committee chair some
thirty years ago, has supported and guided me towards a career in linguistics.
   As always, I thank my wife, Sook-Hi, for patiently and generously taking care of all
the chores at home, giving me constant moral support, and paying much attention to
my health for over forty years of our marriage.
   I dedicate this volume to my beloved grandchildren, Timmy, Elliot, Miran, Aran,
and those yet to be born.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

8.1.2           NounsNouns may follow determiners and precede particles in a sentence. They can also be
modified by a preceding genitive or a relative clause. The noun category contains the
largest number of members, encompassing a majority of the native vocabulary and
most Sino-Korean (SK) and loan words. SK and loan words, except for a small
number of adverbs (e.g., SK cem-cem ‘gradually’, loan (Japanese) ippai ‘fully’), are
nouns in Korean regardless of the word categories they belong to in the source
languages.    For instance, SK mincwu-cwuuy-cek               ‘being democratic’,      SK ye-hayng
‘travel’, SK hayngpok         ‘happiness’, loan khaphi        ‘making copies’, loan khawunthu
‘counting’, loan apeykhu (from French avec ‘with’) ‘dating’, and loan thephu ‘being
tough’ all function as nouns in Korean.
      Nouns   may     be subclassified     into proper nouns,        (numeral)   counters,    defective
nouns, verbal nouns, adjectival nouns, and common                    nouns. Proper nouns include
names of persons, places, books, institutions, countries, continents, and other objects

is a fact that, in casual speech, children’s consonant-final given names such as Milan
and Tongsik are followed by the vowel i before a particle other than a vocative, as in
Milan.i ka ‘Milan’ (nominative),      Tonsik.i nun ‘as for Tongsik’, Milan.i eykey ‘to
Milan’, Tongsik.i lo puthe ‘from Tongsik’. This vowel does not occur when the given
name is followed by a title suffix or a vocative particle, as in Milan-ssi ‘Miss Milan’
and Milan a ‘Milan!’ It does not occur after a foreign name, as in Con un ‘as for John’
but not *Con.i nun.
   Numeral    counters,     which   occur   after   a   numeral,   have    classificatory      or
measurement functions (see 5.2; 5.4). They consist of native, SK, and a few loan
words, which are by and large complementary:            e.g., native mali (animals), chay
(houses), calwu   (long slender objects), and khyelley (pairs of shoes, stockings,
gloves); SK myeng (people), Awen (book volumes), kay (items), tong (buildings), and
cang (flat objects such as sheets of paper); and loan fasu ‘dozen’ (pencils) and kulaym
‘gramme’. Counters are usually used as bound nouns, either preceded by a numeral or
followed by some other element, as in fvu mali ‘two animals’, tases kwen                    ‘five
volumes’, yel tasu ‘ten dozens’ (pencils), mali swu ‘number of animals’, and kwen
tang ‘per volume’. Nouns like salam ‘person’, pyeng ‘bottle’, and kap ‘case’ are used
as both common nouns and counters. For instance, salam ‘person’ is a common noun
in salam i manh-ta ‘there are many people’ and a counter in han salam ‘one person’.
A numeral followed by a counter may be called a numeral compound, in which the
numeral functions as a determiner (see 8.1.4; 9.7.3).
   Korean, especially the native stock, abounds in defective nouns, i.e., bound nouns
which do not occur without being preceded by a demonstrative, a clause, or another
noun. Defective nouns include ccok ‘direction’, ccum           ‘approximation’, cek ‘time,
experience, occasion’, cuum ‘occasion, time’, chay ‘intact, as it is’, chek ‘false show,
pretence’, cwu/ ‘assumed fact, probability, method’, i ‘person’, ka/kka/ci ‘whether, if,
assumed fact’, kes ‘fact, thing, event’, Aim “chance, occasion’, kos ‘place’, /i ‘reason’,
mal ‘the end’, man        ‘size, extent, worth’, mankhum     ‘as much     as, much’,   mulyep
‘around the time when’, na/um ‘dependence, style’, nawi ‘necessity’, myekh ‘toward’,
nolus ‘role, the verge’, pa ‘way, method, point’, ppen ‘the verge, coming near’, ppun
‘alone, only’, pun ‘person’, seng ‘appearance, impression’, seym ‘thinking, plan’, swu
‘way’, fey ‘place, feature’, thek ‘reason, degree’, fongan ‘during’, ttalum ‘nothing
but’, ftaymun ‘reason, because of’, tul ‘etc.’, tung ‘etc.’, and tus ‘likelihood’. Many of
these defective nouns are functionally limited. For instance, while ccok and kes can be
preceded by a demonstrative, a clause, or a noun and function as all cases, cwul is
preceded only by a clause and occurs only as an object of a cognitive verb (e.g., alta
‘know’, moluta ‘do not know’); swu can be preceded only by a clause and occurs only
as a subject of an existential predicate (issta ‘exist’, epsta ‘do not exist’); and tlaymun
‘reason’ occurs only with a preceding nominal and never as the subject of a sentence.

      Verbal nouns denote activity and, combined with a native verb such as hata ‘do,
make’ or foyta ‘become, get’, they become either transitive or intransitive verbs
depending on the nature of the activities they denote and the cooccurring native verb.
Examples of transitive verbs are native salang-hanta (love-do) ‘loves’ and seym-hanta
(counting-do)      ‘counts’; SK kongpu-hanta (study-do) ‘studies’ and kwukyeng-hanta
(sightseeing-do)      ‘sightsees’;   and     loan puliphing-hanta           (briefing-do)    ‘briefs’     and
nothy-hanta (taking notes-do) ‘takes notes’. Examples of intransitive verbs are native
ssilum-hanta (wrestling-do) ‘wrestles’ and cilal-hanta (epileptic fit-do) ‘goes crazy’;
SK mang-hanta (perishing-do) ‘perishes’ and kunmu-hanta (working-do) ‘works’; and
loan feyithu-hanta (dating-do) ‘dates’ and alupaithu-hanta (work-do) ‘(student) works
on a part-time basis’.
   Adjectival nouns indicate stativity. They can combine with a native adjective such
as hata ‘be (in the state of)’ or (i)ta ‘be’ (copula). Examples of native nouns (mostly
bound) include cilwu-hata (boredom-be) ‘is boring’, tfak-hata (pity-be) ‘is pitiful’,
ttattus-hata (warmth-be) ‘is warm’, and kattuk-ita (fullness-be) ‘is full’. SK adjectival
nouns (free except single-syllable words which are bound) include hayngpok-hata
(happiness-be) ‘is happy’, yak-hata (weakness-be) ‘is weak’, philyo-hata (necessity-
be) ‘is necessary’, yelsim-ita (diligence-be) ‘is diligent’, fahayng-ita (much luck-be)
‘is lucky’, choyko-ta (best-be) ‘is the best’, kyelsek-ita (absence-be) ‘is absent’, and
kwahak-cek-ita       (being scientific-be)          ‘is scientific’. Examples        of loan words        are
ceynthul-hata ‘is gentle’, haynsem-hata ‘is handsome’, sumathu-hata                            ‘is smart’,
theykhunikal-hata ‘is technical’, and ippai-ta (fully-be) ‘is full’.
      The common     noun subclass is a waste basket, so to speak, to which all the other
types of nouns may         be assigned.      Many      subsets can be distinguished according to
semantic features such as [+/—concrete], [+/—countable], [+/-animate], [+/—human],
[+/-locational],     and   [+/~compound].           Suffice     it here   to give some       examples      to
illustrate the diversity of this catch-all subclass: aitie ‘idea’, alay ‘the bottom’, aykyo
‘charms’,    cangkwun      ‘general’,      cellumpal-i        ‘lame   person’,   cengpu     ‘government’,
chayk ‘book’, haksayng ‘student’, halapeci ‘grandfather’, hay ‘sun’, ilum ‘name’,
kang-ka ‘riverside’, kay ‘dog’, mincwu-cwuuy ‘democracy’, molay ‘sand’, mul
‘water’, nam-nye-no-so (male-female-old-young) ‘people of all ages’, namu ‘tree’,
nwun     ‘eye’, onul ‘today’, ppalkang              ‘red’, ppang      ‘bread’, san   ‘mountain’, salang
love’, uymu ‘duty’, and uy-sik-cwu ‘food, clothing, and shelter’.

case particle, lacking the present ka. Thus, the present-day Korean phrases namu-ka
‘tree’ (nominative) and so-ka ‘cow’ (nominative) were namo-j and sjo-j, respectively,
until ka was introduced in the sixteenth century. Notice that ij was written (and
pronounced) as a semivowel coda of the preceding vowel ending syllable. After the
vowel / or the semivowel j, the nominative particle did not appear, but its reflex was
indicated by a tonal difference, as in foli + -i + 1o-:/i ‘bridge’ (nominative). After a
consonant, i was used as a separate syllable, as in salom-i ‘person’ (nominative).
     The nominative case particle ka, which is an allomorph (occurring after V) of /,
first appeared in the literature in 1572 (K.M. Lee 1976: 155) and has been used
productively since the seventeenth century. One can only speculate that it could have
been borrowed from Japanese nominative ga. This newly introduced particle has been
redundantly attached to the already nominative-marked na-j (< na + i) ‘I’ (plain
nominative), ca-j (< ce + i) ‘TY (humble nominative), and na-j (< na + 1) ‘you’ (plain
nominative), resulting in n€-ka, ce-ka, and ne-ka, respectively.
     The genitive case particles 07 (after a Yang vowel) and 2) (after a Yin vowel) were
used for plain animate possessors, as in salom-oj ptit ‘a person’s intention’ (present
salam-2j t’is) and kepup-2j theli ‘turtle’s hair’ (present kapuk-2j thal). The form s
was used for honorific animate possessors as in puthja-s toli “Buddha's principle’ and
for inanimate possessors as in nala-s mals'om ‘the language of the country’.
    The honorific vocative particle Aa, which is no longer available in Contemporary
Korean, was used to address the king or Buddha, as in nimkim-ha ‘Honorable King!’
and sa@jcon-ha ‘Honorable Buddha!’. In Contemporary Korean, the obsolete
superpolite vocative form i(siJe is used for God, Christ, Buddha, etc., as in cu-ja
‘Lord!’, im-ia ‘Oh, my beloved!’, and Aana-nim-isia ‘God!’. The use of the plain
vocative particles in Middle Korean is the same as in Contemporary Korean.
    The present-day animate dative—locative—goal particles eke (neutral) and kke
(honorific) developed respectively from Middle Korean neutral animate genitive o//2
+ k(%)-a(kz)j ‘that place’ and from Middle Korean honorific genitive s + k(%)-a(ki)j
as illustrated in nam-oj-ki-aj ‘to another person’, alahan-oj-kekij ‘to an Alahan
              3 Historical development                                                      5]saint’, wan-s ki-aj ‘to the king’, and joelaj-s kekij ‘to Sakyamuni’ (cf. K.M. Lee
ibid.:171).
    In addition to case particles, numerous delimiter particles were used or newly
developed (cf. K.M. Lee ibid.:172-6). For instance, the topic-contrast delimiter
particle alternated between on and in (after C) and between non and nin (after V) to
conform to vowel harmony with the cooccurring nominals. These have been reduced
to in (after C) and nin (after V) in Contemporary Korean. The delimiter kocay
(present k’aci and k’as) ‘until, even, to the best of? developed from the noun kocay
‘edge, extremity’. The delimiter pitha (present putha) ‘(beginning) from’ was formed
from the verb stem pith ‘stick to’ and the infinitive suffix -e, and the delimiter cocha
‘even’ from the verb stem coch ‘follow’ and the infinitive suffix -a, The comparative
delimiters tuko and Jawa and the enumerative delimiter ya existed in Middle Korean,
but have since disappeared. The emphatic delimiter za ‘as only for’ evolved into ja in
the standard speech around the end of sixteenth century, although it is still retained as
sa in certain dialects, as shown in the present-day na-ja/na-sa an ka ‘As for me, | am
not going’ in which sa is dialectal.
    The initial vowels of many inflectional and derivational suffixes of predicates
alternated between Yang and Yin sounds. Such harmonic pairs include -a/e (infinitive
suffix or intimate sentence ender), -ato/ato ‘although’, -ala/ela (plain imperative
ender); -oni/ini ‘because’, -omjan/imjen ‘if’, -osi/isi (subject honorific); -om/im
(nominalizer), -oj/#j7 (nominalizer, as in noph-oj ‘height’, nep-2j ‘width’), -kaj/kej
(instrument), and -po/pi (adjectivizer, as in alpho (< alh-po) ‘sick’ and silphi (<
silh-pi) ‘sad’). These alternating suffixes were used for vowel harmony with the
cooccurring stem-final vowels as observed earlier. There were causative and passive
suffixes -hi, -B, -h, -o, etc. some of which are no longer in use in Contemporary
Korean.
   There were so-called person suffixes (W. Huh 1983:7). For instance, the verb stem
mak ‘eat’ was conjugated as mek-uni ‘as | eat’ when the subject was the first person
and as mek-ini when the subject was not a first person. Similarly, the past tense
suffix -t@ became -fa when the subject was the first person. Alternating vowels like u
and a functioned as inflectional suffixes indicating the grammatical first person. This
ablaut phenomenon ceased to appear in the latter part of the sixteenth century.
   There were three kinds of honorific suffixes: the subject honorific -(2)si (as in
Contemporary Korean), the object honorific -so8 (corresponding to the present
addressee honorific -sip), and the addressee honorific -(2)pi and -sjosje, both
obsolete   in Contemporary    Korean.    The   semantic   property   of the suffix   -sof    is
controversial, i.e., whether it denotes the speaker’s humility towards the addressee or
the speaker’s deference towards the object referent. While the majority of scholars
seem to favour the former interpretation, W. Huh (1972) convincingly argues in
52              The Korean languagefavour of the latter, saying that the suffix underwent a semantic change, becoming the
addressee    honorific   in the latter part of the sixteenth century.      Huh         (ibid.:28-9)
observes that this suffix had      six variants -soB, -coB, -zoB, -sop, -cop, and -zop
which alternated depending on the kinds of the cooccurring neighbouring sounds.
That is, -soZ occurred after k, p, s, and h; -coB after t, c, and ch; and -zo8 after n, /,
and m. The final 6 changes to p when the following sound is a consonant. In r2t-coB-
omjen     ‘if (one) listens to (a respected person)’, for instance, -co8 occurs because it is
preceded by the consonant ¢ and followed by a vowel.
      As for the addressee honorifics in Middle Korean, Huh (ibid.:25; 1984:428—30)
maintains     that the suffix -(Z)pi appeared      in the declarative,     interrogative         and
propositive sentence enders, whereas the suffix -sjosjo was used as a requestive
sentence ender. Examples include koBo-ni-yi-ta ‘is pretty’, in-no-pi-k’a ‘does (it)
exist?’, and nimkim-ha alo-sjosja *Your Majesty, please tell us!’
      The past tense suffixes were -ke, -a/e, and -ta. Only the last form is used in
Contemporary      Korean,   as a retrospective     mood   suffix.   The   prospective          suffix
indicating futurity as well as the speaker’s conjecture was -/i as it is today. The
present-day past tense forms -as’/as’ and the modal suffix                     -kes’     (volition,
presumption, and futurity) had not yet developed in Middle Korean.
    Interrogative sentence enders included alternative question -ka, -a, -nja@ as in sap-
ka pel-a? ‘Is (it) a prize or a punishment?’ and ha-nja cjeki-nja? ‘Is (it) big or
small?’ and explanatory question -ko and -njo as in mj@s salom-ko? ‘How many
people (are there)?’ and oti/-za silim apsin toj isnd-njo? ‘Is there any place where
there is no worry?’ Exclamatory enders included -tota and -fosoita, which have
become obsolete (cf. 1.S. Lee, et al. 1997:302).
      The subject of an embedded relative clause was often marked by a genitive case
particle, as in pumo-oj nah-in mom-On ‘the body that the parents gave birth to’ where
the embedded subject pumo is marked by the genitive                 o/. This     use     has    been
discontinued since the early twentieth century.
      As for the lexicon, there were already a large number of Chinese loan words in the
Korean lexicon, as is still the case today. Middle Korean also had a host of other
linguistic characteristics which are essentially the same as those in Modern and
Contemporary Korean.","[65, 66, 67, 68]"
"
2.2             Altaic hypothesis
The Altaic hypothesis is the most persuasive explanation yet proposed given the
available data and methodological refinements. It includes Korean and Japanese in the
Altaic family which is composed mainly of Turkic, Mongolian, and Manchu-Tungus
groups that range widely in the regions west and north of China. Altaic is thought to
be a linguistic unity spoken sometime during the Neolithic period, and its original
homeland is assumed to be somewhere        in northern or north-central Eurasia (Miller
1976:341). The Ryukyuan language of the Okinawa prefecture of Japan and the
islands belonging to the former Ryukyuan kingdom was considered by some scholars
(e.g., Miller 1971) as a sister language of Japanese but is now considered to be a
Japanese dialect by most Japanese scholars (cf. Shibatani 1990).
   The first noteworthy comparative study of Korean is by Shiratori (1914-6) who
compiled a 595-entry vocabulary comparing Korean and other Altaic languages,
claiming their genetic relationship. Polivanov (1927), noticing the existence of vowel
harmony in Korean, proposed the affinity of Korean to Altaic. It is Ramstedt (1928,
1949,   1952,   1957), however, who   first assigned Korean   into the Altaic family in a
systematic way. Ramstedt deals with the entire field of Altaic comparative linguistics.
Partly due to the etymological contributions of Ramstedt and others, Poppe (1960)
demonstrates the linguistic unity among the Altaic languages, reconstructing the
proto-Altaic phonology, morphology, and lexicon of some 570 roots based on regular
sound correspondences among many of these languages. Poppe’s reconstructions are
summarized and indexed in Street (1974). According to the Altaic hypothesis, the
dominant original Koreans and Japanese were Altaic people who migrated to Korea
and Japan, bringing with them the basic elements of their languages.
   Ramstedt, Poppe, and others found that the proto-Altaic word-initial *p had the
following development: *p > {> h > ZERO. While Old Mongolian had p and Middle

which retains f). In the Manchu-Tungus group, the Nanay, Olcha, and Orok dialects
retain the original p and Manchu has f, whereas Orochen, Evenki, Lamut, etc. have A,
and Solon has ZERO. Turkish has ZERO in general. Korean is regarded as retaining
the original p. These are illustrated below (e.g., Ramstedt 1949 and Poppe 1960).

cognate words as Aara ‘plain’, Auk- ‘to blow’, and Aaru ‘spring’.
      Miller (1971), a strong defender of the Altaic affinity of Korean and Japanese,
includes Korean materials (mainly from Martin 1966) in thirty-six of his fifty-eight
sets of phonological correspondences that relate Japanese to the Altaic (pp. 305-6). In
a recent historical-linguistic study of some ten Old Korean fragments of the Paykcey
dynasty which are preserved largely in Japanese sources, Miller (1979) shows their
etymological relationship to Altaic (see 3.3).
   Skeletal vowel correspondences between reconstructed proto-Altaic (pA) and Old
Korean (OK) (in particular, the language of Unified Sinla, 677-935 AD) are presented
by K.M. Lee (1976:16—9) as in (2), with phonemic transcriptions slightly modified to
conform to the IPA system. A somewhat similar correspondence set is proposed by
B.H. Kim (1984:154) based on pA and Middle Korean (MK).

    As for consonants, K.M. Lee (ibid.:18) and B.H. Kim (ibid.:178) propose slightly
different correspondence sets. The following is from Lee.

      Middle Korean had an aspirate consonant series (4, ph, th, kh) which Old Korean is
assumed to have had, It is not determined, however, whether these aspirate consonants
correspond regularly to the corresponding proto-Altaic voiceless or voiced series.
   Notice in (3) that all four liquid proto-Altaic consonants correspond to Korean /,
which phonetically alternates between [I] (occurring word-finally or before a
consonant) and the flap [r] (occurring before a vowel). The pA | corresponds to
Manchu-Tungus r, Mongolian r, Turkic r, and Korean /, as shown in present-day
Korean     (nun)pola     ‘snowstorm’,                 Mongolian            boroyan     ‘rain’,         and        Yakut     durxan
‘snowstorm’. The pA +? corresponds to Manchu-Tungus r, Mongolian r, Turkic z,
and Korean /, as shown in MK i/ap ‘ridge’, Manchu irun ‘ridge’, Mongolian ira ya
‘ridge’, and Tartar tzan            ‘ridge’. The               pA    +]! corresponds             to Manchu-Tungus                    /,
Mongolian /, Turkic /, and Korean /, as shown in MK alaj ‘below’, Evenki a/as ‘leg’,
Mongolian a/a ‘groin’, and Old Turkish a/ ‘below’. Finally, the pA *? corresponds to
Manchu-Tungus /, Mongolian /, Turkic [, and Korean /, as shown in MK tu/h ‘stone’,
Mongolian ci/ayun ‘stone’, and Old Turkish taf ‘stone’.
      As shown    in Ramstedt            1949, a considerable number of putative cognates are
shared by the Altaic languages and Korean. K.M. Lee (1958) attempts to demonstrate
a close affinity between Manchu and Korean based on a total of 236 lexical sets. K.
Hong (1959) presents some lexical correspondences between Mongolian and Korean,
while Gim      (1968a,   1968b) compares                  vocabulary           (including numerals)                  of Korean,
Japanese, and Altaic languages, and B.H. Kim (1984) makes some Altaic-Korean
lexical and morphological comparisons. The following examples from K.M. Lee and
others demonstrate several regular consonant correspondences between Manchu (M)
and Contemporary Korean (K). Parenthesized forms are either MK                                                or other earlier
forms that are reflected in contemporary dialects.

    Some case endings, verbal nominalizers, and other suffixes are also believed to be
shared by Korean and Altaic languages. For instance, K.M. Lee (1976:20-2) presumes
that the Korean topic-contrast particle (njin ‘as for’ is related to the Mongolian -ni
which developed from the post-nominal third-person genitive particles inu (singular)
and anu (plural), and the Korean directional particle /o to proto-Altaic *ru/*ry. He
also assumes that the Korean inflectional suffixes -(2)/ (prospective), -(2)n (past
relativizer), and -(2)m (nominalizer) are the reflexes respectively of the proto-Altaic
predicate nominalizers *-r, *-n, and *-m. Lee further assumes that the Middle Korean
locative particle aj/aj and the prosecutive particle /i (e.g., ili ‘hither’, t/afi ‘thither’)
correspond to the proto-Altaic dative *a/*e and prosecutive */i, respectively. Itabashi
(1987) presents some Altaic evidence in the Japanese and Korean case system.
      H.K. Kim (1972:227-8) relates the Korean ‘person’ suffix -chi (e.g., i-chi ‘this
guy’) with Manchu        -ci (e.g., caga-ci ‘clerk’, unde-ci ‘errand boy’), Mongolian -chi
(e.g., holda-chi ‘merchant’, yam-chi ‘guide’), and Turkish -ci (e.g., karak-ci ‘thief’,
ala-ci ‘murderer’). The Korean instrumental nominalizer -ké (e.g., c'ip-ke ‘tweezers’,
pe-ke    ‘pillow’)    is regarded    as being related to Manchu      -ku,   etc. (e.g., chiri-ku
‘pillow’, efi-ku ‘broom’), Mongolian -ge, -gei, etc. (e.g., ger-gei ‘wife’, kygy-ge
‘drum’), and Turkish -ga, -ke, etc. (e.g., seber-ga ‘broom’, meik-ke ‘knife’).
   While a systematic establishment of sound correspondences between Korean and
Altaic or proto-Altaic is lacking, the similarities among the languages, not only in
many individual lexical items but in various levels of linguistic systems, cannot be
ascribed merely to accidental correspondence, genuine borrowing, or pure typology.
22              The Korean languageIn the same vein, many linguists have argued for the Japanese relationship to the
Altaic, notably Boller (1857), Prohle (1916-17), Ramstedt (1924), Murayama (1962,
1974), Miller (1971), Street and Miller (1975), Street (1978), and Starostin (1991).
Thus, the Altaic origin of Korean and Japanese is a generally accepted hypothesis,
although the hypothesis must be further refined and verified, In terms of the number
of seeming cognates, it is safe to say that, among the Altaic groups, Manchu-Tungus
is the closest to Korean, followed by Mongolian and then Turkish, It must be noted,
however, that there are scholars such as Haguenauer (1956), P. Kim (1960), H. Kwon
(1962), Kawamoto (1974), and Kiyose (1986) who are sceptical about the affinity.
      Many typologically shared features have been cited to relate Korean to Altaic (e.g.,
Fujioka 1908; Ogura 1935; K.M. Lee 1976). Although typological relationships help
support genetic relationships especially when exclusively shared among the languages
being     compared,    they   are      generally    considered   of   secondary   importance       in
comparative work. Some salient typological features are as follows.
   Korean, Japanese, and Altaic languages manifest striking syntactic similarities.
The basic word-order common to them is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). Conforming
to the general tendencies of SOV languages, modifiers such as adjectives, adverbs,
and conjunctive, relative, and complement clauses precede the elements they modify,
while postpositions occur in place of prepositions. In all of these languages, the
singular and plural forms of nouns are not strictly distinguished; articles and
conjunctions are not developed; no affix exists in adjectives to express the
comparative or superlative degree; relative pronouns do not exist; the endings
indicating sentence-types such as declarative, interrogative, propositive, and
imperative are placed at the end of the sentence; and sentences may consist only of a
predicate, with the subject and other cases contextually or situationally understood.
Further, possession is expressed by an existential predicate in these languages. For the
syntactic parallelism regarding grammatical cases, see J. Sohn 1973.
      The morphological structure common to Korean, Japanese, and Altaic languages is
agglutinative in that words are formed by adding one or more semantically clear-cut
suffixes or particles to an unchanging stem, as illustrated below. The Mongolian
example is from B.H. Kim (1984:65).","[34, 35, 36, 37, 38]"
"
9.5.1          Syntactic cases: nominative, accusative, and genitiveNominative,    accusative,       and    genitive    cases,   which      may       be    termed    syntactic    (or
structural) cases in Korean fulfil the most productive grammatical functions. Since
they are, by and large, predictable from context, case particles are frequently omitted
in colloquial speech if no emphasis, deference, or exclusiveness is intended. These
three particles (ka/i, (ul, and uy) cannot cooccur with a delimiter denoting topicality
such as (n)Jun ‘as for’, (i)ya ‘as only for’, and fo ‘also’ because all of them occupy the
last position in a noun phrase.

                        ‘(only/as for/also) Minho’s book’
      The nominative case, whether ovetly marked by a particle or not, most frequently
functions as the subject of a predicate. Thus, few predicates can occur without the
nominative      case.        It also     functions       as the        object          of a transitive     adjective,   the
complement of the copula ita ‘be’ or an ita ‘not be’ and the verb foyta ‘become’, and
a sentential subject in multiple topic constructions, as illustrated in (111) with overt
case marking.

                        ‘Milan has big eyes.’   The function of the nominative case as the subject of a predicate is ubiquitous. Its
function as the object of a transitive adjective includes not only emotive constructions
such as (111b) and na nun ney ka kekceng i-ta ‘I am worried about you’, but also
‘possession’ sentences such as Aal.apeci kkeyse chayk i manh-usey-yo ‘Grandpa has
many books’, and ‘necessity’ sentences such as Cihwan.i eykey/ka ton i philyohay-yo
“Cihwan needs money’, ‘ease/difficulty’ sentences such as na nun swuhak i elyew-
e.yo “As for me math is difficult’, and ‘possibility’ sentences such as Mia nun wuncen
i kKanunghay ‘It is possible for Mia to drive.’ The function of the nominative case as a

complement        can       further be illustrated by sentences                like   Yongho    ka yelsim       i-ta
*Yongho is diligent’, wuli atul i yel sal i toy-ess-e.yo ‘My son has turned ten years of
age’, and ku kes un mal i an toy-n-ta ‘That doesn’t make sense.’ Note that the
nominative particle must be omitted when the complement                                  appears immediately
before the copula ita. Thus, *Yongho ka yelsim i i-ta ‘Yongho is diligent’ is not
acceptable. All hierarchical sentential subjects in a multiple-topic construction are in
the nominative case, as illustrated in halmeni ka os i somay ka han ccok i kkuth i
ccic.eci-sy-ess-e.yo ‘The end of one sleeve of my grandma’s clothes is torn.’
    The honorific particle kkeyse is used to mark the subject, including the sentential
subject of a multiple-topic construction. It has derived from the honorific source
kkeyse (e.g., apeci kkeyse pat-un ton ‘the money that I got from father’) and cannot be
used to mark a complement, as in ape-nim kkeyse kyocang i(/*kkeyse) toy-sy-ess-e
‘My father became a principal’, nor to mark an object of a transitive adjective, as in
na nun sensayng-nim i(/*kkeyse) coh-a ‘| like my teacher.’
   The nominative particle ka/i and the deferential kkeyse are frequently used to
introduce new information as a topic or subject into a discourse, Furthermore, ka/i
(but not kkeyse) may indicate ‘exclusiveness’ of the referent of the cooccurring
nominal. This exclusiveness meaning arises when the predicate is an adjective or a
generic   verb,        or when        the nominal         and/or   the particle       are stressed.      When    the
nominative        particle      is used       to    introduce      new   information       or   to     convey    the
exclusiveness of the referent, it is never omitted, not even in casual speech.

   The accusative case, whether explicitly marked by a particle or not, functions not
only as the direct object of a transitive verb (113a) but also as the direct object of a
passive-transitive verb (113b), the purpose of an action denoted by a verb of
movement (113c), the duration or distance covered by an action (113d), the object of a

      The category ‘others’ includes borrowings from Chinese (some recent words such
as names of foods), Sanskrit (mainly Buddhist terms like sekkamoni ‘Buddha’, namu
amithapul ‘save us, merciful Buddha’), Hebrew (Bible terms), Manchu, Indian,
Arabic, Persian, Malaysian, Norwegian, Turkish, etc., as well as many words whose
origins are not determinable. Since Pae was published, a large number of English
words have been introduced as new loan words and many existing loan words from
other languages have been replaced by English loans. As a result, the total number of
current loan words is estimated at over 20,000, of which English occupies over 90%.
    English loan words have been introduced into the Korean lexicon either through
Japanese (before 1945) or directly (after 1945). In fact, most borrowings since 1945,
especially in South Korea, are words from English which range over all aspects of life
including clothing,       food and drink, electricity and electronics,   automobiles,   sports,
arts, education, social activities, politics, economy, and business transactions. Random
examples are given in (25).

   Loan words from native Japanese are not many, despite long contact between the
two countries. Due to anti-Japanese sentiment after the Second World War, many
Japanese words have been expelled from the Korean lexicon. Examples of remaining

                  Writing systemsThis    chapter       surveys   the writing   systems      that have     been    used     for the graphic
representation of Korean. At present, the Korean alphabet, called Hankul, is the main
writing system used by all Koreans to represent native, Sino-Korean, and loan words,
while Chinese characters are optionally used to represent only Sino-Korean words.
The Itwu (lit. ‘Clerk Reading’) script which was derived from Chinese characters is a
historical relic. Romanization systems are mainly for those who are not familiar with
the Hankul system or for publications written in English.","[133, 134, 135, 136, 137]"

9,14]           Lexico-suffixal patterns of honorifics
We define honorifics (indexical politeness forms) as grammatical and lexical forms
encoding the speaker's socio-culturally appropriate regard towards the addressee (1.e.,
addressee     honorification)   and   the   referent   (i.e., referent   honorification).   Relative
interpersonal relationships are elaborately encoded in various linguistic forms to the
extent that speech acts cannot be performed without taking the notion of honorifics
into account. Sentences cannot be uttered without the speaker’s approximate
knowledge of his social relationship with the addressee and/or referent in terms of age
category (adult, adolescent, or child), social status, kinship, and/or in- and
outgroupness. The honorific system of Korean                is the most     systematic among      all
known languages. In this respect, Korean may be called an honorific language. In the
               9 Grammatical structure                                                       409
following are presented the patterns of currently used honorifics many of which have
already been presented here and there in relevant chapters,
9.14.1.1     | Personal pronouns
Korean has a system of hierarchical personal pronouns, as presented in 8.1.3: first
person ce, na; second person elusin, tayk, tangsin, caki, caney, ne; third person D pun,
D i, D salam, D ay where D stands for a demonstrative. Recall that, in general, the
first person humble form ce is used when talking to a senior or an adult equal and the
plain form na when talking to a child or a younger adult. The second person elusin is
often used to a respected person of over sixty years of age, while tayk ‘you’ (lit.
‘honourable house’) is used to refer to an adult stranger and cannot be used to a social
superior. The blunt form fangsin is used to refer to an adult inferior, e.g., by a boss to
his subordinate, except between husband and wife in which case the form carries an
affectionate connotation. The familiar form caney is used by a superior to a much
younger adult or adolescent inferior (e.g., one’s adult student), or by a parent-in-law to
a son-in-law, etc. The plain form ne is used to address or refer to a child or equivalent
(e.g., one’s own child or grandchild). Thus, except for the rarely used elusin, Korean
does not have a second person pronoun to refer to a socially superior person.
Consequently, Koreans make very extensive use of nominal substitutes such as
sensayng-nim      ‘you’ (lit. ‘esteemed teacher’) and sacang-nim        ‘you’ (lit. “esteemed
company president’).
  Note that for third person pronouns, only demonstrative compounds are used, which
consist of hierarchical nouns pun ‘esteemed person’, i ‘person’, salam ‘person’, and
ailay ‘child’. Between i and salam, the former is considered relatively higher. A
husband refers to his wife with ce salam ‘that person’, whereas a wife refers to her
husband with ce i ‘that person’.","[424, 425]"

9.4.2             Conjunctive constructions
A sentence may contain two or more clauses that are conjoined either coordinately or
subordinately. The distinction between coordination and subordination is not clear-cut
and is a matter of degree. Although there may be some syntactic criteria, such as the
permutability of conjuncts without change in meaning and the appearance or non-
appearance of the tense suffix in the first conjunct, the absence or presence of
semantic dependency is usually the most basic criterion.
   There are various syntactic constraints associated with conjunctive suffixes, For
instance,   the        suffix    -(ujmyense      ‘while’   which   connects    two   simultaneous     events
allows no tense suffix to appear before it because the tense of the main clause governs
the tense of the -(u)myense clause. Notice in (66) that na ‘I’ is the subject of the two
clauses, and that the -umyense clause is interpreted as past time even though -umyense
is not preceded by the past tense suffix -ess.(66)              na       nun      pap     ul      mek-umyense       sinmun    ul _ ilk-ess-e.
                  I        TC       meal    AC      eat-while         newspaper AC read-PST-INT
                  “While I was eating, | read the newspaper.’
9.4.2.1           CoordinationCoordination,          consisting     usually     of    and-coordination,     buf-coordination,     and   or-
coordination,          is realized by way          of (i) a conjunctive       suffix, (ii) repetition of a
conjunctive suffix, (iii) the conjunctive particle man(un), (iv) an idiomatized nominal
form functioning as a verbal suffix, and (v) juxtaposition of clauses with appropriate
intonation. The first pattern (use of a conjunctive suffix) is the most productive, for
which the following suffixes are frequently used.(67)              a,      simultaneity/sequentiality (and-coordination)
                          -keniwa             ‘not only .. . but also, as well as’
                          -ko                 ‘and, and also, as well’
                          -ko(se)             ‘and, and then’
                          -(uJmye             ‘and, and on the other hand’

                  contrastiveness (but/or-coordination)
                  -ciman(un)         ‘but, yet, nevertheless’
                  -kena              ‘or, or else, what- (when-, how-, etc.) ever’
                  -nuni              ‘rather, instead of doing’
                  -tunci             ‘or, or else, what- (when-, how-, etc.) ever’
                  -(ujna             ‘but, however’
  The most typical and frequently used coordinative construction is formed with the
uffix -ko ‘and’ as illustrated in (68).
68)          a.   Kiho     ka      ka-ci       an-h-ko         Nami       ka _ ka-ss-ni?
                  Kiho NM_         go-NOM_     not-do-and       Nami      NM _ go-PST-Q
                  ‘Is it Nami who went, not Kiho?’
                  ce salam          un     sensayng   i  an        i-ko — haksayng           i-a.
                  that person       TC     teacher    NM not       be-and student            be-INT
                  ‘That person over there is not a teacher but a student.’
  More formal counterparts of -ko are -(u)mye ‘and’ and -yo ‘and’, which may be
sed only in formal contexts or in writing. The latter conjoins only copular clauses.69)          a.   nam un kaypang-kwuk i-mye puk un _ phyeysoy-kwuk              i-ta.
                  south TC open-nation      be-and north TC closed-nation      be-DC
                  ‘South Korea is an open and North Korea is a closed nation.’             b. ku      pun     un     cangkwan_     i-yo, = hakca_      ta.
                  that person TC       minister      be-and scholar be-DC
                  ‘That person is a cabinet minister, and is a scholar.’  Disjunction is expressed by -kena or -tunci, and contrast by -(u)na or -ciman(un).
ach two suffixes are synonymous except that the former sounds more formal.70)          a.   Kiho     ka       w-ass-kena/tunci        Nami         ka      w-ass-e.
                  Kiho     NM _     come-PST-or             Nami         NM _ come-PST-INT
                  ‘Either Kiho or Nami came.’

306              The Korean language      A second coordinative pattern is the repetition of paired conjunctive suffixes with a
contrastive meaning. Paired forms include the synonymous -kena . . . -kena and -tunci
... -tunci ‘(regardless) whether . . . or’.’
(71)           ku    yenghwa          ka _ coh-kena nappu-kena              nan            an _ po-keyss-e.
               the   movie            NM good-or _ bad-or                   I TC           not see-will-INT
               “Whether the movie is good or bad, I will not watch it.’
   A third pattern of coordinative conjunction is the use of the conjunctive particle
man(un) ‘but’ which occurs after a sentence ender.
(72)            a.   Mia nun ka-ss-up-ni-ta                 man(un) ce nun an ka-keyss-e.yo.
                     Mia TC go-PST-AH-IN-DC                 but     I TC not go-will-POL
                     ‘Mia went, but I won’t go.’
                b.   ka-po-sey-yo         man(un) pesu       ka_     ttena-ss-ul              ke     = yey-yo.
                     go-try-SH-POL but                bus    NM leave-PST-PRS                 fact     be-POL
                     ‘Please hurry, but the bus may have left.’
      A fourth pattern is the use of fossilized forms such as -muntey ‘and, but, while’ and
the suppositive -nunci ‘probably because, perhaps it does . . . so’. These forms consist
of the indicative relative clause ender -nu-n (IN-RL) and a defective noun fey ‘place,
circumstance’ or ci ‘whether’, suggesting that the earlier relative constructions
(relative clause + head noun) have become grammaticalized as conjunctive suffixes.
(73)            a.   pom      i         w-ass-nuntey        nalssi         ka      acik        chwup-ney.

                     ‘Spring is here, but it is still cold!’                b.   ai-tul       i       ca-nunci           cip       i          co.yongha-kwun!
                     child-PL NM_ sleep-perhaps house NM _ quiet-APP
                     ‘Perhaps the children are sleeping; the house is quiet.’      A final coordinative pattern is juxtaposition of two sentences. One subtype is the
juxtaposition of two interrogative sentences including rhetorical ones for alternative
questions, with rising intonation in the first conjunct and falling intonation in the
second as in (74a). Another subtype                  is the juxtaposition          of certain        idiomatic
declarative constructions as in (74b).

                 adverbializer:             ~j *-ly’   Many of the above suffixes must have been grammaticalized from other
constructions as indicated in 8.7. Thus, for instance, -(u)mu/o must have developed
from -(u)m ulo (NOM with), -te/ato from -te-/a ko hay-to (RT-DC QT say-but) ‘even
if (someone) says that (he) observed . . .’, -(u)/-mangceng from -(u)! mangceng (PRS
fortune), -koca from -ko cap-a (NOM be wishful-and), -tus.i from tus-i (appearance-
AD), -(u)l swulok from the prospective -(u)/ and the defective noun swulok ‘the more’,
and -(u)ni from -(u)nikka (after the retrospective suffix -te, only -(u)ni, not -(u)nikka,
is allowed).
      Sentences with representative subordinative suffixes are illustrated in (76).(76)            a.   Kiho       ka _ ka-se            Nami ka            wul-ess-e.

9.4.3          Relative clause constructionsA clause modifying a head nominal in Korean is broadly called a relative or
adnominal clause. While Korean has no relative pronouns that correspond to English
relative   pronouns         like who,      whose,       whom,        which,    or that,       relative     clauses   are
connected to their head nominals by means of the relativizer suffix (RL) -(u)n. This
relativizer is realized as ZERO after the prospective suffix -(u)/ on the one hand, as in
ka-l salam (go-PRS-RL person) ‘a person who will go’, and incorporates past tense
after a verb stem on the other, as in ka-n salam (go-PST-RL person) ‘a person who
went’. Incorporation of past tense might have been caused by the historical deletion of
the sequence of the past tense suffix and the indicative mood suffix (-ess-nu/-ass-nu)
except in the Kyengsang dialect where ka-ss-nu-n salam is still used instead, Even in
standard Korean, the undeleted form occurs in a limited number of grammaticalized
310              The Korean languageconstructions such as ka-ss-nuntey (< nu-n tey) ‘while (he) went’ and ka-ss-nunci (<
nu-n ci) ‘whether (he) went’. The regular relative clause enders are given in (78).

form of verbs and the indicative non-past form of adjectives are the same. Lack of the
adjective past form is partly attributable to the continuity of the state over a certain
time period that an adjective denotes, which is not the case with verbs which denote
largely transient actions.
       Four subtypes of relative clauses can be established depending on how a modifying
clause and its head nominal are related: (i) relative clauses proper, (ii) fact-S type
clauses, (iii) so-called headless relative clauses, and (iv) coreferent-opaque clauses.
Relative clauses proper (traditional relative clauses) are those in which a relativized
nominal (in the form of ZERO pronominal PRO) coreferential to the head nominal
can be conceptually postulated within the relative clause. For instance, (79a) may be
regarded as being derived from (79b) where the ZERO pronoun in the embedded
clause is the object of the verb mannata ‘meet’ and refers to the head nominal yeca
‘woman’,

   A majority of relative clauses are of this type. A PRO in a relative clause holds
various grammatical relations such as subject, object, goal, locative, source, and
adjunct. For instance, the PRO in (80a) is subject, that in (80b) is goal, that in (80c) is
dative, that in (80d) is locative, that in (80e) is source, and that in (80f) is instrument.

   Notice that the nouns coreferential to the head noun are omitted together with the
case particle, unlike in English where prepositions like to and in appear before a
relative pronoun or at the end of the relative clause. It is often claimed that, in
English, relativization involves the movement of a relativized noun to the front of the
relative   clause   where         it is       then     pronominalized                   or    deleted.     Movement        and
pronominalization are not involved in Korean, and only coreferential omission occurs.
312                The Korean languageendangers the recoverability of the omitted nominal. In this case, a pronominal copy
called a resumptive pronoun may be left behind with a relevant case particle.(81)               wuli ka keki eyse chwulpalhay-se hak.kyo-lo ka-n         ku pyengwen

6.3.4.2        Direction of writing
Hankul syllable blocks are written either horizontally or vertically in a running text. In
general, horizontal writing is preferred in contemporary Korea. When horizontal, the
rows are written from top to bottom, each row moving                  from left to right; when
vertical, the columns are written from right to left, each column moving from top to
bottom. These are illustrated with the first stanza of the folk song Alilang.

6.3.4.3             Morphophonemic spelling
When Hankul was created, the letters were combined into blocks consisting essentially
of spoken (phonetic) syllables. The current practice, especially since Korean linguists’
enactment of the Unified Spelling System (1933), is the binding of letters into
morpheme-based (morphophonemic) syllables. Thus, for instance, the previous
spelling 7] = ki.phun ‘being deep’ is now changed to 2& kiph.un, because, although
it is pronounced as [ki.phin], the meaning ‘deep’ is represented by the morpheme 2
kiph and the meaning ‘being’ by the morpheme & un. Similarly, %+=>9! han.kwuk.in
‘Koreans’, although pronounced as ¢+-?7! [han.gu.gin], consists of three morphemes,
%t han ‘Korea’, ++ kwuk ‘country’, and @! in ‘person’, each morpheme consisting of
one     syllable.         4}-     na.mu    {na.mu]   ‘tree’   is a single   morpheme       consisting of two
syllables, and is written as pronounced. % kaps ‘price’, although pronounced as 7
[kap} when no vowel-initial morpheme follows, is spelled as such because it is
pronounced as %{ kaps when followed by a vowel, as in %f©] kaps.i [kap.§’i] with the
nominative case particle ©] i.
      Forms like 2 kiph,                 & un, % han, > kwuk, 2! in, 44 namu, % kaps, and ©) i
are morphemic or morphophonemic forms because all the different surface (phonetic)
forms     are derived             from    them,   conditioned    by   various   sound     environments.     For
instance, the morphemic form 4 kiph is realized phonetically as 4] [kip] before a
non-nasal consonant, as in 432 [kip.k’o] ‘deep and’, as % [kim] before a nasal
consonant, as in 4%} [kim.ni] ‘is it deep?’, and as it is before a vowel, as in 7]
(ki.phi] ‘depth’ (lit. ‘deep-ness’). Since the current spelling convention allows only 2
kiph, disregarding the other sound variations, as in 43! kiph-ko ‘deep and’, 2344
kiph-ni ‘is it deep?’, and 2°] kiph-i ‘depth’, the Hankul spelling can be called
morphemic or morphophonemic. For a detailed discussion of the rules involved in
deriving phonetic forms from morphophonemic representations, see chapter 7 (sound
patterns).
      Single spelling blocks may contain two morphemes as in %{ kass ‘went’,                         & pol ‘to
see’, and & anh ‘not do/be’, which consist of 7} ka ‘go’ and                            ss (past tense suffix),
3 po ‘see’ and = / (prospective suffix), and 2t an ‘not’ and & A ‘do/be’,
respectively. That is, if a morpheme does not contain a vowel, it is attached to the
preceding syllable block in the syllable-final position.
144            The Korean language6.3.4.4        Spacing and marks
In running texts, space is placed before all nouns, including compound or bound nouns
as well as pronouns. There is no space between the elements within a compound. As
for the other word classes, space is placed only before each free word. Thus, all
suffixes are attached to the respective stems, and all particles to the heads.","[158, 159, 160]"

8.7                 GrammaticalizationMany words and affixes have developed from other words or larger constructions
through a long period of evolution. It has been widely observed that living languages
constantly         change    unidirectionally       from   larger     to   smaller       units.     Korean     is no
exception. Many syntactic constructions have evolved into lexical items; and many
words in a major category (nouns, verbs, and adjectives) have developed into minor
category elements such as adverbs, particles, and affixes. For instance, the adjective
kwaynchanhta ‘be fine, good’ has developed from the complex verbal construction
kwan-kyey-ha-ci ani hata (relate-relate-do-NOM not do) ‘do not get involved’ through
syntactic     reduction,        semantic   shift,    and   phonological           attrition.      The   conjunctive
adverbs kuliko ‘and’ and ku/ena ‘but’ are from ku-li ha-ko (that-way do-and) ‘does so
and’ and ku-le ha-na (that-way do/be-but) “does/is so but’, respectively. Similarly, the
adverb fepule ‘together’ is from tepul-e (accompany-and)                             ‘by accompanying’; the
yocative adverb imma               ‘you!’ is from i nom-a           (this-fellow-VOC)              ‘this guy!’, the
262              The Korean languagesentence-initial adverb isscanh-a.yo ‘hey, by the way’ is from iss-ci ani hay-yo (exist-
NOM      not be-POL) ‘isn’t there (something)?’, the time adverb encey ‘when’ is from
enu cey (which time) ‘which time’; the determiner musun ‘what kind of is from mues
i-n (what is-RL) ‘being what’, and the determiner yo-kkacis ‘this much of is from i
kaci (uy) (this kind (of)) ‘of this kind’.
      All auxiliary verbs have developed from the corresponding main verbs through
syntactic and semantic changes. For instance, the auxiliary pofa ‘try’ is from the main
pota ‘see, look’, the auxiliary pelita ‘finish up’ is from the main pelita ‘throw away’,
and the auxiliary cwuta ‘do for’ is from the main cwuta ‘give’.
      Numerous    particles     (case,   delimiter,   and   conjunctive)   have   developed   from
complex predicate or nominal constructions. Notice in (64) that some of them are
completely fossilized, others are premature, and still others are at the incipient stage
of grammaticalization.

      Many   inflectional     suffixes   have   developed     from   content   words   or complex
syntactic constructions. For instance, the past/perfect suffix -ess/-ass has evolved from
the resultative existential construction -e/-a isi (INF exist) ‘be in the state of
              8 Word structure                                                             263
doing/being’; the modal suffix -keyss ‘may’ from the past periphrastic (long-form)
causative construction -key ha.y-ess (AD cause-PST) ‘caused (someone/something) to
do/be’; and the addressee honorific suffix -(su)p from the verb salp ‘tell (a senior)’.
Similarly, many conjunctive suffixes have derived from complex constructions. For
instance, -koca ‘intending to’ is from -ko cap-a (NOM intend-and) ‘wishes to do and
so’; -cako ‘intending to’ is from -ca ko ha-ko (PR QT say-and) ‘says ‘let’s .. .’ and
then’, -ese/-ase ‘and then, and so’ is from -e/-a isi-e (INF exist-and) ‘be in the state of
doing/being . . . and so’, and -ultheyntey ‘supposedly’ is from -ul the i-n tey ey (PRS
site/situation be-RL place at) ‘in the circumstance which will be the case that. . .’.
   New    sentence    enders   have    been   created   by   contracting   various    complex
constructions (cf. 8.4.3). For instance, -(uj//lay ‘I intend to’ is from -(uj/ye-ko-hay
‘intends to do’, -(uj/la ‘I warn you that...’ is from -(uJli-/a ‘will/may’, -canh.a ‘you
see!’ is from -ci ani hay? ‘Isn’t it the case that . . .?’, -u/key ‘I assure you that...’ is
from -u/ kes i-e (PRS case/thing be-INT) ‘it will be the case that . . .’, -u/ kes kath-ta
‘it seems that...” is from -ul kes kwa kath-ta ‘is the same as’, and -napota ‘it appears
that...” is from -na po-n-ta (whether see-IN-DC) ‘see whether . . .’. Numerous other
sentence enders have developed from conjunctive, nominal, or other constructions by
way of main clause deletion (see 9.14.3; H.M. Sohn 1990a). For instance, -ulkkel ‘1
wish/suppose that...” is from -u/ kes ul (PRS fact/thing AC), -tanikka ‘I told you that
... 18 from -fa ko ha-nikka (DC QT say-because), and -tamyense ‘I heard that . . is it
true?’ is from -ta ko ha-myense (DC QT            say-while), all by way      of main clause
deletion. As discussed in 8.4.3, the familiar-level interrogative enders -nu-nka (e.g.,
ka-nu-nka? ‘Does (he) go?), -na (e.g., kKa-na? ‘Does (he) go?’), and -te-nka (e.g., ka-
te-nka? ‘Did you see (him) go?’) have developed via main clause deletion from the
indirect question constructions -nu-n ka (IN-RL whether) ‘whether . . .’, -na (whether)
‘whether. . .’, and -te-n ka (RT-RL whether) ‘whether (it) did/was . . .’, respectively.
   It may be assumed that most derivational prefixes and suffixes have developed
from full words or complex constructions through grammaticalization. While there are
many recently grammaticalized affixes whose source words are either transparent or
readily recoverable, there are many other fossilized affixes whose sources are vague
and thus not easily identifiable. For instance, the adjectival prefix cham- ‘true, real,
genuine’ as in cham-kilum ‘sesame oil’, cham-kkay ‘sesame seeds’, cham-mal (-word)
‘true remark, truth’, cham-namu (-tree) ‘a kind of oak’, cham-say (-bird) ‘sparrow’,
and cham-ttus (-intention) ‘sincere intention’ can easily be associated with the noun
cham ‘truth, reality’ and the adverb cham ‘really, trully’. Similarly, the adjectival
prefix tul- ‘wild, of low quality’ as in tul-kilum (-oil) ‘perilla oil’ (lit. ‘wild oil’), tu/-
kkay (-sesame) ‘perilla seeds’, and tul-kwuk.hwa (-chrysanthemum) ‘wild camomile’
must have developed from the noun fu/ ‘field’. The adjectivizer suffix -tap ‘be like’ as
in yeca-tapta ‘be womanly, woman-like’ and sanay-tapta ‘manly, man-like’ can be
264             The Korean languagerelated to the obsolete adjective fapta (standard: kathta) ‘be like’ which is still used
only in the Ceycwu dialect.
      On the other hand, lexical sources of many fossilized and unproductive suffixes
such as the nominalizer suffix -ang/-eng ‘quality’ as in kem-eng (black-) ‘black
colour’ and nol-ang (yellow-) ‘yellow colour’, the adjectiviser suffix -(y)ep ‘be in the
state of as in Awi-yepta (value-) ‘be cute’ and no-yepta (anger-) ‘be offended’, and
the adjectivizer suffix -(e)p/-up ‘able, in the state of as in kuli-pta (long for-) ‘be
missing’, mul-epta (bite-) ‘be itchy’, and wus-upfa (laugh-) “be funny’ are opaque.
    As briefly noted in 8.3.2, the passive derivational suffixes in Korean seem to have
diverged from causative suffixes by way of functional or semantic shift. First of all,
the passive suffix forms (-i, -hi, -/i, and -ki) constitute a subset of the causative suffix
forms (-i, -hi, -li, -ki, -wu, -kwu, -chwu, etc.). Thus, numerous passive and causative
verbs have the same forms (e.g., po-ita ‘show, be seen’, an-kita ‘cause (one) to hug,
be hugged’). Second, both passive suffixes and causative suffixes are allomorphic
variants in each set whose forms are phonologically and lexically conditioned. Third,
only a limited number of verbs participate in causative or passive suffixation. Fourth,
causative and passive suffixes share a single mophological slot in predicates. Thus, a
causative suffix and a passive suffix cannot occur together in a sentence, that is, they
are mutually exclusive in syntactic usage (see 9.9). Fifth, functional or semantic shift
from causative to passive may have been facilitated by the necessary implicational
relation between causing (causative) and undergoing (passive) an event. For more
discussion, see 9.9. Then, where did the causative suffixes come from? Without any
concrete historical evidence, one can only speculate from a grammaticalization
perspective that they might have diverged from the ancient form of the periphrastic
causative -key ha ‘cause (someone/something) to do/be’ via contraction, in a way
somewhat similar to the historical derivation of the modal suffix -keyss from the past
causative construction -key ha.y-ess (H.M.       Sohn   1996). One recent innovation in
support of this hypothesis is the frequent use of the form nolla-khita ‘surprise
(someone)’ which has obviously diverged from the periphrasitic causative nolla-key
hata ‘make (someone) surprise’.
      There are many interesting studies on grammaticalization phenomena in Korean,
from which many of the above examples are quoted. Representative works include W.
Huh 1972, 1984; K.M. Lee 1976; H.M. Sohn 1990b, 1996, 1998; J.I. Kwon 1992;

This    chapter surveys         the syntactic and    semantic     characteristics     of contemporary
standard Korean. The discussions proceed in the order of structural essentials (9.1),
sentence types (9.2), syntactic relations (9.3), embedded clauses (9.4), case marking
(9.5), delimiter constructions (9.6), numeral constructions (9.7), modality and tense-
aspect (9.8), passive and causative constructions (9.9), complex predicate
constructions (9.10), negation (9.11), adverbial constructions (9.12), reduction
phenomena (9.13), and honorifics and politeness strategies (9.14). For further
descriptive and theoretical studies, see the works cited in the appended bibliography.","[277, 278, 279, 280, 281]"

8.5.5.1          Native compoundsOne type is noun + intransitive verb. The verbs involved usually denote process,
rather than activity.        In general,   the noun    and verb can be split by inserting a
nominative particle after the noun. When split, they no longer constitute a compound,
but function as a subject and a predicate, respectively. Thus, cam-tulta (sleep-set in)
‘fall asleep’ is a compound, but cam i tulta (sleep NM set in) ‘fall asleep’ is not. In
rare cases, a locative or directional particle may occur, as in aph-seta (front-stand) vs.
aph ey seta (front at stand) ‘stand ahead’ and kewul-samta (mirror-take) vs. kewul lo
samta (mirror as take) ‘take as a model’.              The following examples      all allow a
nominative particle to be inserted after the noun.
(47)             kep-nata           (fear-come out)           ‘be scared’
                 kil-tulta          (road-enter)              ‘get used to’
                 kum-kata           (line-go)                 ‘crack, split’
                 sal-ccita          (flesh-grow fat)          ‘gain weight’
                 sin-nata           (excitement-occur)        ‘get excited’
                 swum-cita          (breath-fall)             ‘breathe one’s last breath’
      A second type is noun + transitive verb. This type usually allows an accusative
particle to be inserted after the noun if the noun can be used independently, as in cam-

cata (sleep-sleep) vs. cam ul cata (sleep AC sleep) ‘sleep (a sleep)’. Although the
compounds    of this type       contain    a transitive    verb   root,    they   themselves   are not
necessarily transitive verbs. For instance, cam-cata ‘sleep’ is an intransitive verb,
whereas mal-hata (word-do) ‘speak’ is a transitive verb in clauses such as yenge lul
mal-hata ‘speak English’. The following examples all allow an accusative particle to
be inserted after the noun.(48)          aph-mos-pota_        (front-unable-see)             ‘be blind’
              ay-ssuta             (effort-use)                   ‘make efforts’
              him-ipta             (power-wear)                   ‘owe, be indebted to’
              maum-mekta           (mind-eat)                     ‘intend, plan’
              pap-hata             (rice-do)                      ‘cook rice’
              salang-hata       _ (love-do)                       ‘love’
              sin-sinta            (shoe-wear)                    “wear shoes’
              sok-thaywuta         (inside-burn)                  “worry oneself’
              son-pota             (hand-see)                     *fix’
   Another major native type is verb + complementizer + verb. The most common
complementizer is the infinitive suffix -e/-a. Some other suffixes such as the
transferentive -efa/-ata ‘and then’ and the conjunctive -ko ‘and’ are also used.

      Juxtaposition of verbs is another pattern of verbal compounding.

                tu-na-tulta            (enter-go out-enter)    ‘frequent’
   Another compound verb type is adverb + verb. Frequently, reduplicated sound
symbolic adverbs combine with the verb hata ‘do’.

8.5.5.2         SK—native and loan—native compoundsA large number of SK nouns and a small number of loan nouns combine with a native
verb (e.g., hata ‘do’) to form hybrid compound              verbs. The compounds        may be
intransitive (52a) or transitive (52b). Loan-native compounds are illustrated in (52c).

8.5.6.1       Native compounds
Typical native compounds consist of a noun and an adjective. The noun is either a free
(e.g., hemul ‘fault’, kaps ‘price’) or a bound noun (e.g., kkaykkus- ‘cleanness’, ttattus-
‘warmth’), as illustrated in (53a) and (53b), respectively. In general, the component
roots of the bound     noun type cannot be separated by a case particle. The most
frequently used adjective in the bound type is Aata ‘be (in the state of)’.

                   tumppuk-ita      (full-be)               ‘be full’   There are compounds consisting of an adjective/adverb + an adjective. The adverb
is often an onomatopoeic word.

              mos-hata              (bad-be)                ‘be inferior’
   Adjectives are reduplicated with the insertion of the emphasizer -ti ‘and, very’.

256              The Korean language8.5.6.2         SK-—native and loan—native compounds
Compound adjectives of the SK noun + native adjective type are numerous (56a). The
majority of the SK nouns are adjectival nouns, and the most common native verb is
hata ‘be (in the state of)’. A loan noun may also be followed by a native adjective
(S6b). In general, no case particle can be inserted between the noun and the adjective.

                     theykhunikhal-hata_   (technical-be)      ‘be technical’
8.5.7           Compound determiners
Compound determiners are rare and may include native demonstratives such as eften
(< e-tte-ha-n (which-kind-be-RL)) ‘what kind of, some kind of’, i-kkacis (< i kaci
(this kind)) ‘this much of’, and ku-len (< ku-le-ha-n (that-kind-be-RL)) ‘that kind of’,
and native compound qualifiers and quantifiers such as amu-amu              ‘such and such’,
musun (< mues-i-n (what-be-RL)) ‘what kind of’, myech-myech            ‘several’, motun (<
motwu-n (collect-RL)) ‘all’, on-kac ‘all kinds of, and weyn (< way-i-n (why-be-RL))
‘what sort of , and SK determiners such as pyel(-uy)-pyel ‘various kinds of’ where
pyel means ‘speciality’. The emphasizer affix -na ‘and, very, extremely’ is infixed
between two reduplicated forms of a few adjectives in relative clauses, as in khu-na-
khu-n ‘very big’ (khuta ‘be big’), me-na-me-n ‘very far’ (melta ‘be far’), and ki-na-ki-
n ‘very long’ (kilta ‘be long’). These forms are used only as compound determiners.","[268, 269, 270, 271, 272]"

9.2.4.1        Copular sentencesThe copula is ita ‘be’ which is an adjective because it inflects in the same way as
other adjectives do. Its usual meaning is equational, definitional, identificational, or
descriptive, and never existential. In casual speech, the copula stem i is pronounced as
ZERO between a vowel and a consonant and y between vowels, as in na ta ‘(It) is me’
(plain level), na y-a ‘(It) is me’ (intimate level), and na y-ess-ta ‘(It) was me.’ Being
an adjective in its own right, unlike in English (e.g., ‘He is happy’), it never occurs
before or after another adjective. The negative counterpart is anita ‘be not’, which is
analysable either as ani ‘not’ and ZERO copula or, as in this book, as an ‘not’ and ita
copula. Like other adjectives, ita cannot be preceded by the negative adverb mos
‘cannot’, hence *mos ita ‘cannot be’ is ungrammatical.
   Copular sentences take a complement                  in the nominative     case, and copulative
complements are usually nominals (nouns, pronouns, numerals, noun phrases, etc.).
(26)           ce    ay      nun chencay      (i)-ciman Mia nun chencay              ka   an_   i-ta.
                that child TC genius        be-but    Mia TC            genius       NM   not   be-DC
                ‘That child is a genius but Mia is not.’
Notice in (26) that the nominal complement takes the nominative case and is overtly
marked with ka in negative sentences. It is covert or unmarked in positive sentences.
Thus, copular sentences are double nominative constructions. The subject and its
complement in a copular sentence must occur in that order.
   Although the complements of the following copular sentences are nominals, they
are descriptive,    not definitional,     equational,      or identificational.      Together   with      a
nominal complement, the copula indicates the state that the nominal denotes.(27)           a.   wuli     tongsayng        un    yelsim        i-eyyo.
                    our __ brother            TC    diligence     be-POL
                    “My younger brother is diligent.’
               b.   ce     nun   wuli    ai        ka        kekceng    i-eyyo.

                      *Milan is too sentimental.’
      The complements in (28) are composed of a head noun (bold-faced) preceded by a
relative clause (bracketed). Note that the head noun of each complement and the

1.5.4       Writing systems
For centuries before the indigenous Korean phonetic alphabet called Hankul was
created by King Seycong, the fourth king of the Cosen dynasty, and his assistants
(scholars in the royal academy called Cip.hyencen ‘Hall of Assembled Sages’) in
1443, only Chinese characters were used. Currently, Korean texts are written either
purely in Hankul or by means of a mixed script of Hankul and Chinese characters.
While Hankul can represent any lexical items, including native, Sino-Korean, loan,
and foreign words and morphemes, Chinese characters are used to represent only
Sino-Korean words and morphemes. The current trend indicates an increasing use of
Hankul spellings over Chinese characters, such that even in newspapers and scholarly
books, use of Chinese characters is considerably limited.
    Koreans are truly proud of Hankul, one of the most scientific writing systems that
has been created by man. Its creation was based on an intensive analysis of the sound
pattern of Korean and the phonological theory available at that time. The design of the
alphabetic symbols was ingenious. Three basic vowel symbols depicted heaven (round
dot: ¢), earth (horizontal line:   — ) and man (vertical line: |) following cosmological
philosophy. Different combinations of these three symbols generate all vowels and
semivowels existing in Korean. The round dot was later changed into a short
horizontal or vertical stroke on a long line. Consonant symbols depict the shapes of
speech organs: lips, teeth, tongue, and throat.
   Hankul symbols are combined into syllable blocks. In forming a syllable block, a
consonant    symbol   is placed first, then a vowel   or diphthong   symbol,   and then a
consonant symbol, if needed, in left-to-right and top-to-bottom order.
     The current Hankul orthographical practice follows the principle of morphemic
(i.e., morphophonemic) spelling in both South and North Korea. Thus, in principle,
one morpheme is spelled in one invariant Hankul form regardless of various context-
sensitive sound alternations. A series of simple phonological rules are required to
obtain correct pronunciations from Hankul spellings.
14              The Korean language1.5.5           The sound pattern
Korean has nineteen consonant, ten vowel, and two semivowel phonemes. There is a
three-way contrast (lax—aspirate—tense) in stop consonants, a two-way contrast (lax-
tense) in the alveo-dental fricatives, and no contrast (only aspirate) in the glottal
fricative, as in lax (plain): p, t, ¢, kK, s aspirate: ph, th, ch, kh, h; and tense: p’, t’, ¢’,
k’, s’. The remaining four consonants are I, m, n, 0.
     Although with dialectal variations, the Korean vowel system consists of five front
vowels (three unround: i, e, €; two round: y, @) and five back vowels (three unround:
4, 8, a; two round: u, 0). An equal set of long vowels exists distinctly in the older
generation speakers, while it is obsolete in the younger generation. Tone distinctions
in vowels used to be significant in fifteenth-century Korean (Middle Korean), but now
exist only in southeastern (Kyengsang) and northeastern (Hamkyeng) dialects. The
two semivowels are the palatal j and the labial w.
     The Korean phonetic syllable structure is of the form (C)(G)V(C). That is, Korean
speech allows only one optional consonant (C) and one optional glide or semivowel
(G) in the onset position, and one optional consonant in the coda position. The only
obligatory element is the nucleus vowel (V). Thus, for instance, the single-syllable
English word strike is borrowed in Korean as a five-syllable loan word suthulaikhu
sithilaikhi [si.thi.ca.i.khi] with the insertion of the vowel [+] to make it conform
to the Korean syllable structure. Similarly, the Korean word kaps ‘price’ in kaps i
kaps-i [kap.s’i] ‘price (subject)’ loses its final        s when spoken before a consonant or
when it occurs alone, because a spoken syllable does not allow two consonants after a
vowel, thus [Kap] ‘price’ and [kap.t’o] ‘price also’.
     Sound symbolism is widespread. Korean has several thousands of sound symbolic
words.   A large number of them show differences among                  lax, aspirate, and tense
consonants.    In these words, a lax consonant tends to connote slowness, gentleness,
heaviness, and bigness, an aspirate consonant,            flexibility, elasticity, crispiness, and
swiftness, and a tense consonant, compactness, tightness, hardness, smallness, and
extra swiftness, ¢.g., pingping pi-pin (as of a plane), phingphing phin-phin (as of a
motor belt), and ppingpping p’in-p’in (as of a top) ‘(turn) round and round’.
Similarly, so-called bright (Yang) vowels such as a and o tend to connote brightness,
sharpness,    lightness,   smallness,   thinness,   and    quickness,   whereas   so-called   dark
(Ying) vowels such as e, u, and © indicate darkness, heaviness, dullness, slowness,
deepness, and thickness, e.g., panccak panc’ak vs. penccek penc’ek ‘twinkling’ and
kkolkkak k’olk’ak vs. kkwulkkek k’ulk’ek ‘guiping down’. Vowel harmony also
occurs, without connotational differences, in stem-suffix combinations, as in poala
po-ala ‘Look!’ and puela pu-ela ‘Pour!’, but not *poela po-ela and *puala pu-ala.
                  I Introduction                                                                      151.5.6             Agglutinative morphology
Korean is called an ‘agglutinative’ language, in that a long chain of particles or
suffixes   with    constant    form    and   meaning   may    be   attached    to nominals      (nouns,
pronouns, numerals, noun phrases, etc.) or predicate (verb or adjective) stems. In
yeca-tul man uy kolphu ‘the golf (played) by females only’, for instance, the plural
suffix -tul, the delimiter particle man ‘only’, and the genitive particle uy follow the
head noun yeca ‘female’. Similarly, in ka-si-ess-keyss-sup-ni-ta ‘(a respectable
person) may have gone’, the subject honorific suffix -si, the past tense suffix -ess, the
presumptive modal suffix -keyss, the addressee honorific suffix -sup, the indicative
mood suffix -ni, and the declarative suffix -ta@ occur in that order after the head verb
stem ka ‘go’. As observed in these examples, numerous Korean suffixes and particles
do not have counterparts in many non-agglutinative languages such as English and
Chinese. On the other hand, there are many particles and suffixes in Korean that do
correspond to independent words in other languages. For instance, many English
conjunctive words are equivalent to Korean conjunctive suffixes, as in ka-ko ‘go and’
and ka-myen ‘if (one) goes’ where -ko ‘and’ and -myen ‘if’ are conjunctive suffixes.","[29, 30, 31]"

9.2.4.4        Sensory sentences
Sensory adjectives which denote emotion or sensation constitute a relatively large
subclass of adjectives. As a sensory adjective, some words such as pulepta ‘be
envious, envy’, mipta          ‘be hateful, hate’, and silhta               ‘be disagreeable,     dislike’   are
always used as transitive, as in na nun ney ka pulew-e ‘1 envy you’. Some other words
such as simsimhata           ‘be bored’ and kamsa-hata               ‘be thankful’ are usually used as
intransitive, as in (yele-pun eykey) kamsa-ha-p-ni-ta ‘Thank you; I am thankful (to all
of you).” Still other sensory words, such as sul/phuta ‘be sad, feel sad’, komapta ‘be
thankful, thank’, and musepta ‘be scared, fear’, are used both intransitively as in (36a)
and transitively as in (36b).(36)           a.    ne       nun     musep-ni?
                     you      TC      scary-Q
                     ‘Are you scared?’
               b. nme         nun       ce           kay   ka        musep-ni?
                  you         TC        that         dog   NM _      fear-Q
                     ‘Do you fear that dog?’
   Some sensory adjectives are compounds derived originally from a phrase with an
existential adjective, as in caymi issta ‘be interesting’ (lit. ‘interest exists’), maum ey
epsta ‘dislike’ (lit. ‘do not exist in mind’), and kekceng epsta ‘do not worry’ (lit.
‘worry does not exist’).
   Certain adjectives are both sensory and descriptive depending on whether the
subject is a human or non-human. For instance, chwupta is descriptive in nalssi ka
chwup-ta ‘The weather is cold’, but sensory in na nun chwup-ta ‘I am cold’; cohta is
descriptive in i kulim i coh-ta ‘This picture is good’, but sensory in na nun i kulim i
coh-ta ‘I like this picture.’ To this group belong adjectives such as caymi issta ‘be
286             The Korean languageinteresting’, ipputa ‘be pretty’, musepta           ‘be scary’, and oylopta    ‘be lonely’. For
instance, compare ce kay ka musep-ta ‘That dog over there is scary’ with the two
sensory sentences in (36). On the other hand, many other sensory adjectives such as
pulepta ‘envy’ and koylopta ‘be distressed’ cannot be used in this way since they
cannot take non-human subjects.
   Sensory adjectives denote only an unobservable internal state of mind. Therefore,
they are used only with the first person subject in declaratives and with the second
person subject in interrogatives when they occur in the present indicative mood;
otherwise they are unnatural,
(37)            a.   na     nun         simsimha-ta.
                     I     TC           bored-DC
                     ‘I am bored.’
                b.   me     nun         simsimha-ni?
                     you    TC          bored-Q
                     ‘Are you bored?’                c.   ?ne    nun         simsimha-ta.
                     you   TC           bored-DC
                     “You are bored.’
   Sentences like (37c) may be acceptable only when the speaker is in a position to
know the subject referent’s feeling or sensation. When they occur in the past tense or
with a modal suffix, however, there is no such restriction, as observed in (38). This
may be because, in the case of past tense, the speaker may have heard about the
subject referent’s internal feeling or sensation and, in the case of a modal, the speaker
can make a guess or inference.
(38)            a.   halmeni-     nun      ecey         simsimha-sy-ess-e.

                     ‘My grandma felt bored yesterday.”                b.   hal.apeci    nun       nayil       kippu-si-keyss-e.yo.

                     “My grandma may be happy tomorrow.’
      Similarly, attachment of complex evidential forms like -(uJn mo.yang i-ta ‘appear
to be’ or -(uj/ kes i-ta ‘will be/do’, or the indicatory verb hata ‘do, show signs of
                 9 Grammatical structure                                                         287
being’ renders otherwise unnatural sentences acceptable, as in (39). Notice in (39b)
that the sentence is no longer an adjective but a verb construction, in that it has a
compound verb (i.e., kipp-e hata) of which a sensory adjective stem is a part.
(39)             a.    ne      nun          cikum        sulphu-n    mo.yang           i-kwun.

                       ‘Inho is very happy now,’
       The desiderative adjective siphta ‘be desirable, wish’ is a special transitive sensory
adjective. It is a bound adjective and is used only when preceded by a verb clause that
ends in the nominalizer suffix -ko.(40)              na     nun         ku       chinkwu       ka _ po-ko       siph-e.

                  ‘I wish to see that friend.’
9.2.5             TransitivityThe dichotomy between transitive and intransitive has less syntactic motivation in
Korean than in some other languages. Passivization, for instance, does not provide any
conclusive evidence because only a limited subset of transitive verbs can be turned
into passive forms, as in mekta ‘eat’ vs. mek-hita ‘be eaten’ and mit.ta ‘believe’ vs.
mit-kita ‘be believed’, but ttaylita ‘hit’ vs. ? ‘be hit’ and cwuta ‘give’ vs. ? ‘be given’.
It is often claimed that the accusative particle (J)ul is the direct object marker and a
verb preceded by a noun with this particle is transitive. It is true that all clearly
transitive verbs have an object with this particle. If we follow this criterion, however,
there would be very few verbs which are not transitive. For instance, the obviously
intransitive verb wulta ‘cry’ can occur with a duration noun followed by (Jul, as in
twu si-kan ul wu-n-ta ‘(He) has been crying for two hours’, the intransitive verb kata
‘go’ occurs with (/)u/ in constructions such as hakkyo lul ka-n-ta ‘(He) goes to school’
and kwukyeng ul ka-n-ta ‘(He) goes sightseeing.’ Despite the lack of absolute criteria,
it is useful to talk about (in)transitivity. For instance, we can say that so-called middle
verbs like wumcikita ‘move (something), move by itself? and pulta ‘blow (something),
blow by itself’ are used both transitively and intransitively to correspond to the two
meanings that each verb carries, and that pota ‘see’ and cwuk-ita ‘kill’ are transitives
288               The Korean languagewhose intransitive counterparts are po-ita ‘be seen’ and cwukta ‘die’, respectively.
       Semantically, transitivity is traditionally understood as carry-over or transference
of an action from one participant (¢.g., an agent) to another (e.g., a patient), Needless
to say, transitivity is a matter of degree, i.e., some sentences are more transitive than
others     depending         on   the kind        of predicates          involved,        agency   of the   subject,
affectedness of the object, etc. For instance, the sentences in (41), all of which are
assumed to be transitive since at least one direct object appears, show semantic
transitivity in decreasing order.

   As alluded to in the examples in (41), the traditional definition of transitive verbs
is slightly modified for the description of Korean in this volume such that any
predicate in a sentence with an agent or experiencer as the subject and a patient or a
theme as the object is defined as transitive. Thus, the subject of a transitive sentence is
not necessarily an agent but could also be an experiencer as in (41d, e, f), and an
adjective can also be transitive if it occurs with a patient as in (4le, f). The objects of

transitive verbs are marked                with an accusative particle, while those                 of transitive
adjectives are marked with a nominative particle due to their low transitivity. The
predicates which do not satisfy the above conditions are intransitive.","[301, 302, 303, 304, 305]"

       In actual utterances, a speaker tends to place an animate, definite and/or specific
noun phrase before the other noun phrases. Furthermore, due to the well-developed
case-marking system, word order among the major constituents in a sentence is
relatively free as long as the predicate-final constraint is maintained. Thus, all the
following sentences are natural, only with slight connotative differences in terms of
topicality or focus.(50)             a.    na nun ecey          san        eyse kkweng ul        cap-ass-e.yo.

294                The Korean language       In principle, pre-predicate scrambling occurs among the major constituents within
the sentence or clause, provided that reordering that would cause semantic anomaly or
ambiguity is usually blocked (cf. J.H. Cho 1994). In general, a topicalized or focused
nominal is placed at the beginning of a sentence. The subject must always occur
before the complement of a copula and the verb foyta ‘become’ and before the object
of a transitive adjective. This restriction may be due to the basicness of subject-initial
order.     Thus,    the second      nominative       elements     in the sentences        in (51)   must   be
interpreted as the complement or object.

9.8.4                Tense and aspect
Tense and aspect interact closely with each other in their realization in syntactic and
morphological forms. Tense is a grammatical category that locates the event (i.e.,
action, process, or state) denoted by a predicate on a time scale: past, present, or
future,      i.e.,   prior      to,     simultaneous     with,     or     subsequent            to     a   reference      time,
respectively. A reference time is usually the moment of speaking (utterance time), but
may also be a past or future time. For instance, if an event is prior to a reference time
which is prior to the moment of speaking, we can talk about past-past.
      While tense is defined with reference to points in time, aspect is usually defined in
terms of the beginning, duration, completion, repetition, resulting, etc. of a verb and
without reference to its position in time (e.g., S.O. Sohn                                    1995). That is, aspect is
concerned with the internal temporal constituency of a situation. In Korean, aspect is
observed not only in verbal suffixes but more frequently in complex predicates (9.10).
      When      the reference time is the same                  as the utterance time, we can talk about
absolute tense-aspect. There are two inflectional suffix slots that are relevant to tense
and aspect. One or both slots may be filled with -(e/a)ss whose basic meaning is past
but also includes perfect. If only one slot is filled, it refers to simple past or present
perfect, depending on cooccurring time adverbials such as ecey ‘yesterday’, i nyen cen
ey ‘two years ago’, and cikum ‘now’ or discourse contexts. If both slots are filled, they
denote either past-past or past perfect. If no slot is filled, it is non-past, i.e., (generic)
present, present progressive, or future, the interpretation of which again depends on
time adverbials or discourse contexts, as illustrated in (168).

                    ‘My father will leave for Japan tomorrow.’
   The suffix -(e/a)ss which has historically derived from the resultative state -e/-a
issta ‘be in the state of . . .’ denotes resultative state when it occurs with ‘resultative’
verbs such as falmta ‘take after’, ipta ‘wear’, and nulkta ‘get old’. To indicate past in
such cases, doubling of the suffix is necessary.(169)         a.    hyeng          un         apeci         tlul          talm-ass-e.

364               The Korean language      Perfect meanings involved in the suffix -(e/a)ss are particularly distinct in so-called
transferentive (TR) constructions in which the suffix -taka denotes transference from
one event to another. (170a) denotes a situation in which the subject referent did not
arrive at the church (an imperfect event) and (170b) a situation in which the subject
referent    did    arrive    at the     church        (a perfect     event).   Furthermore,       in (170c),   a
threatening speech act, -ess is associated with future perfect.

                       “You are a dead person tomorrow!’    In the conditional clause of an optative sentence, the past tense form is often used
instead of the non-past ZERO form, as in nayil pi ka w-ass-umyen coh-keyss-e ‘It
would be nice if it rained tomorrow.’
    The double-past form typically indicates that a past event situation no longer holds
true at present. Notice the different implications in (171a) and (171b).
(171)             a.   ku    paywu              nun    Hongkhong        ulo _ ttena-ss-ta.
                       the   actor              TC     HongKong         to     leave-PST-DC
                       ‘The actor (has) left for Hong Kong (and he is no longer here).’                  b.   ku    paywu              nun    Hongkhong        ulo       ttena-ss-ess-ta.
                       the actor      TC      HongKong    to      leave-PST-PST-DC
                       ‘The actor had left for Hong Kong (but he may be here now).’      When the reference time is not the same as the utterance time, we can talk about
relative tense-aspect, because the event time refers not to the utterance time but to a
time that precedes or follows the utterance time. This is the case with many complex
sentence constructions where the reference time of the embedded tense is the time
denoted by the main clause tense.

                     ‘Last night, it seemed that it was snowing.’
   In the above examples, the embedded tense is non-past (marked by ZERO), yet the
embedded event took place in the past. The embedded event time takes the main
clause event time, not the utterance time, as the reference point, hence the absence of
the past tense suffix in embedded clauses.
   Not all embedded clauses are required to have relative tense-aspect. For instance,
coordinate clauses frequently manifest absolute tense-aspect in that they refer to the
utterance time.(173)          a.    Milani        nun        ca-ss-ko               Tongmin.i nun kongpuhay-ss-e.yo.
                     Milan         TC         sleep-PST-and          Tongmin TC study-PST-POL
                     ‘Milan slept and Tongmin studied.’

                     ‘I liked the car but didn’t buy it.’
   While most complement clauses are subject to relative tense-aspect, relative and
nominalized     clauses     are subject to both               absolute    and relative tense-aspect.      The
embedded      tense in the following                 relative sentence     may     be interpreted as either
absolute (i) or relative (ii).
(174)           hyengsa       ka     pa eyse nolayha-nu-n yeca                     lul   chayphohay-ss-ta.

                i. “The police detective arrested a woman who sings in a bar.’
                ii. ‘The police detective arrested a woman who sang in a bar.’
   The embedded clauses that require relative tense-aspect are of two general types:
(a) those structurally not allowing any tense other than non-past tense and (b) those
allowing either past or non-past tense. In both types, the embedded event may occur
prior to, simultaneously with, or after the main clause event. The first type includes
those embedded clauses which end in suffixes such as -e/-a (infinitive), -key ‘so that’,
366              The Korean language-tolok ‘to the point where’, -ca-maca                         ‘as soon as’, and -ese/-ase ‘as, since’, as
illustrated in (175). When predicates are multiply embedded, as in (175a), only the
tense of the last or main predicate is the reference point.
(175)            a.     nam-un            pap        ul        mek-e — chiw-e           pely-ess-ni?

                        “My younger brother went out as soon as it cleared up.’
      The   second    type includes those embedded                     clauses which     end in conjunctive
suffixes such as -(u)myense ‘while’ and -taka ‘and then’, nominalizers such as -(u)m
and -ki, defective nouns such as kes ‘fact’, tus ‘as if, and chey/chek ‘pretence’, and
the quotative particle ko. In these constructions, the embedded past tense suffix occurs
only when the embedded clause event takes place prior to the matrix clause event.(176)            a.     Mia nun       manh-i                  ca-ss-umyense phikonhay          hay-ss-e.

                        ‘Mia felt tired even though she had slept a lot.’

                        Milan said that she had been sick.’
      Relative tense-aspect is observable even in a simple sentence with the retrospective
mood suffix. The retrospective suffix inherently carries a past time feature, and the
tense-aspect of the verb occurring with this suffix must have the retrospective past as
the reference time.

9.9            Passive and causative constructionsPassives and causatives in Korean are expressed by derivational suffixes which take
the same slot, as observed in the passive mek-hi-keyss-ta                       ‘may be eaten’ and the
causative mek-i-keyss-ta ‘may make (one) eat, feed’. The set of passive suffixes and
that of causative suffixes are similar in form, and in some words both forms are
identical, as in po-ita ‘be seen; show’, ep-hita               ‘be carried on the back; make             (one)
carry on the back’, cap-hita ‘be caught; cause to hold’, an-kita ‘be hugged, cause to
hug’, ¢tut-kita ‘be torn off; cause to tear off, kel-lita ‘be walked, cause to walk’, and
mul-lita ‘be bitten; cause to bite’. Both sets of suffixes occur with a limited number of
predicates. The difference usually appears in syntactic structure since a passive verb
functions as an intransitive usually with a subject and a goal/agentive, whereas a
causative verb functions as a transitive with a subject and an object or a ditransitive
with a subject, a goal, and an object.
(178)          a.   ai        tul     eykey   pihayngki        ka _ po-y-ess-ta.                  (passive)
                    child PL to       plane          NM see-PAS-PST-DC
                    ‘The plane was seen by (lit. ‘to’) the children.’
               b.   na nun ai-tul              eykey   kulim       ul     po-y-ess-ta.          (causative)
                    I    TC         child-PL to        picture     AC     see-CAS-PST-DC
                    ‘I showed a picture to the children.’
      When a passive verb is accompanied by an object, ambiguity occurs in syntactic
structure. The sentence in (179) is interpreted as both passive (i) and causative (ii).(179)          emeni          nun      aki     eykey    son      ul     — cap-hy-ess-ta.
               mother    TC   child by/to hand AC _ hold-PAS/CAS-PST-DC
               i. “Mother was caught by her hand by the child.’
                ii. ‘Mother caused the child to hold her hand.’
   From the shared properties such as the same morphological slot, similar forms,
occurrence with limited predicates, and shared syntactic behaviour, it is proposed that
Korean passive suffixes have developed from causative suffixes via functional shift
(see H.M. Sohn 1996 for details). Furthermore, it is speculated that various
allomorphs of causative suffixes developed from the ancient form of the phrasal
causative construction -key ha(y) (-AD do) ‘cause’                        via   formal     contraction     and
semantic reduction from indirect to direct causation.
368              The Korean language9,9,]            Passive sentencesA construction        is passive when        the subject is acted upon.      In general, an active
transitive sentence is changed to a passive intransitive sentence, when (a) the object
(accusative) of the active sentence is made the subject (nominative), (b) the active
verb is replaced by the matching passive verb, (c) the subject (nominative) of the
active sentence is made the agent with a locative/goal particle or otherwise omitted,
and usually (d) the new subject is placed at the sentence-initial position. The locative-
goal particles functioning as agentive are kkey “by (human, deferential]’, eykey ‘by
[animate, formal]’, hanthey ‘by [animate, informal]’, and ey ‘by [animal, inanimate]’.
(180)            a.   swunkyeng          i   ku    totwuk    ul    cap-ass-ta.             (active)

                      ‘The thief was caught by the police.’
                 b.   thayphung      i       ku    sem      ul __ hwipssul-ess-ta.         (active)
                      typhoon        NM      the   island   AC    devastate-PST-DC
                      ‘The typhoon devastated the island.’
                 b'.ku      sem    i         thayphung      ey hwipssul-ly-ess-ta.  (passive)
                     the    island NM        typhoon        by devastate-PAS-PST-DC
                      ‘The island was devastated by the typhoon.’
      Only a limited set of transitive verbs can have passive forms with a passive suffix.
For instance, verbs which do not allow a passive suffix include verbs ending in ha
‘do’ (e.g., Kongpuhata        ‘study’, yaksok.hata ‘promise’), dative or benefactive verbs
(e.g., cwuta ‘give’, pat.ta ‘receive’, topta ‘help’, ipta ‘wear’), cognitive verbs (e.g.,
alta ‘know’, moluta ‘do not know’), symmetrical verbs (e.g., mannata ‘meet’, talmta
‘resemble’, ssawuta ‘fight’), and many others. Verbs whose stems end in the vowel i
usually do not take a passive suffix (e.g., Aaluchita ‘teach’, ttaylita ‘hit’, tencita
‘throw’, mancita ‘touch’, nukkita ‘feel’), one exception being chita ‘run over’ vs. chi-
ita ‘be run over’.
      There are four variants in the passive suffix, -i, -Ai, -/i, and -ki, whose occurrence is
conditioned largely by the stem-final sound. The vowel i in each allomorph changes to
y before the vowel ¢ in casual speech (e.g., po-y-ess-ta “was seen’).

Notice in the above that the vowel u is deleted before the passive suffix (e.g., camkuta
vs. camk-ita) and that f-irregular verbs have their ¢ changed to / before the suffix -/i
(e.g., tut.ta ‘hear’ vs. tul-lita ‘be heard’).
   There are some syntactic aspects rather peculiar to Korean passive constructions.
First, if no passive form is available or the passive form is semantically or
pragmatically inappropriate, an active construction is used with the focused or
topicalized object placed in the sentence-initial position.(182)          a.    ko.yangi      ka        cwi lul          cwuk-y-ess-e.yo.
                     cat           NM       rat AC _          kill-CAS-PST-POL
                     ‘A cat killed the rat.’
                b.   cwi      lul/nun      ko.yangi         = ka         cwuk-y-ess-e.yo.
                     rat      AC/TC        cat                NM _       kill-CAS-PST-DC
                     *The rat, a cat killed it.’
   Second,     as    inanimate     agent         subjects     are    pragmatically     avoided      except     in
metaphorical or personified expressions, passive constructions are preferred in such
370              The Korean languagecases. Thus, mos i os ul ccic-ess-ta “A nail tore my clothes’ is an unnatural expression
in favour of os i mos ey ccic-ky-ess-ta ‘My clothes were torn by a nail.’
      Third, when     an object nominal              is preceded by a possessive noun in an active
sentence, two passive constructions can be made. One is obtained by making the
object of the active sentence the subject (183b). The other is obtained by placing the
possessor noun of the object in the active sentence as the subject of the passive
sentence (183c). In the latter, the object of the active sentence remains unaffected.
(183)            a.   IlIpon     i        Hankwuk          uy          yengtho       lul      ppayas-ass-ta.
                      Japan    NM Korea                    GN          territory     AC       take-PST-DC
                      ‘Japan occupied the Korean territory,’
                 b.   Hankwuk         uy         yengtho        ka        Ilpon      ey(key) ppayas-ky-ess-ia.
                      Korea      GN territory NM Japan by           take-PAS-PST-DC
                      ‘The Korean territory was occupied by Japan.’
                 c.   Hankwuk         i          Ilpon     ey(key) yengtho                  lul        ppayas-ky-ess-ta.
                      Korea           NM         Japan     by              territory        AC         take-PAS-PST-DC
                      ‘Korea had its territory occupied by Japan.’
      Not all possessive constructions allow the passivization of the ‘adversative’ type
(183c). Only those with an adversative passive verb do. Adversative passive verbs
include palp-hita       “be stepped on’, ppayas-kita, cap-hita                               ‘be caught’, mul-lita          “be
bitten’, Akocip-hita ‘be pinched’, cha-ita ‘be kicked’, and cal-lita ‘be cut’. Thus,
constructions with other passive verbs cannot be used as adversative, as in (184).
(184)            a.   *Mia     ka               Cihwan.i     hanthey            sathang           ul       mek-hy-ess-ta.
                       Mia     NM          Cihwan            by                 candy             AC       eat-PAS-PST-DC
                      ‘Mia had her candy eaten by Cihwan.’
                 b.   *Milan.i       ka         Yongho       eykey         pay-kkop                ul     po-y-ess-ta.
                       Milan         NM         Yongho       by            belly-button            AC      see-PAS-PST-DC
                      ‘Milan had her belly-button seen by Yongho.’
      Fourth, there are certain passive constructions that do not allow a regular agentive
particle to occur. This is the case when use of a regular agentive particle (Aanthey,
etc.)    would   be   interpreted          as     locative        or     goal      rather     than        agentive.   In   such
constructions, the idiomatic phrase ey uyha.ye(se) or ey uyhay(se) ‘by, owing to, in
accordance with’ (i.e., locative particle ey + uyhata ‘depend, follow’ + conjunctive
               9 Grammatical structure                                                                    37]
suffix -(e)se ‘and’) is used. Use of the phrasal agentive form, however, renders the
sentence very formal and sometimes unnatural.
(185)         ce kenmul un                    cwuin        ey uyhayse     hak.kyo ey phal-ly-ess-ta.
              that building TC                owner        by             school to sell-PAS-PST-DC
               ‘That building over there was sold to the school by the owner.’
Note in the above that replacement of ey uyhayse with a regular agentive particle
eykey or hanthey will lead to either ungrammaticality or a different meaning, as eykey
or hanthey will mean not ‘by’ but ‘to’ in such sentences.
   Finally, certain passive constructions are considerably idiomatized, in which case
their active counterparts do not convey the same meaning. Thus, sentences like the
following lack corresponding active sentences.
(186)          a.     nalssi         ka            phul-ly-ess-e.yo.

                      “The weather has cleared up.’ (lit. “The weather was cleared.)
               b.     appa      ka         kamki         ey _ kel-ly-ess-e.yo.

                      ‘I have no appetite. (lit. ‘Food is not eaten.”)Note, for instance, that (186a) is different from X ka nalssi lul phul-ess-e.yo ‘X
cleared up the weather’ and (186b) from kamki ka appa lul kel-ess-e.yo ‘A cold caught
my dad’.
   In addition to the suffixal passive verbs illustrated above, there are verbs that may
be analysed as passive in terms of their meaning and syntactic behaviour and thus can
be called   lexical    passive       verbs.        There    are two    general   subtypes.   One   such   type
includes pure lexical passive verbs whose forms are entirely different from active
verbs, as shown in chita/ttaylita ‘hit? vs. macta ‘be hit’.
(187)          a.     Yongho         nun        Kihan       ul _ ttayly-ess-ta.
                      Yongho         TC         Kihan       AC    _hit-PST-DC
                      “Yongho hit Kihan.’
372              The Korean language                b.     Kihan        un            Yongho           hanthey             mac-ass-ta.
                       Kihan        TC            Yongho           by                  get hit-PST-DC
                       “Kihan got hit by Yongho.’
      The other lexical type includes verbs such as fanghata ‘undergo’, pat.ta ‘receive
(an action), suffer’, tut.ta ‘hear’, macta ‘receive’, and toyta ‘become’, which combine
with verbal nouns to form compound passive verbs. Examples include Awutha-hata
‘assault’ vs. Awutha-tanghata                     “be assaulted’; changphi-cwuta                      ‘insult’ vs. changphi-
tanghata ‘be insulted’; cemlyeng-hata ‘occupy’ vs. cemlyeng-tanghata “be occupied’;
conkyeng-hata         ‘respect’?        vs.       conkyeng-pat.ta                “be    respected’;     cwumok-hata     ‘pay
attention to’ vs. cwumok-pat.ta                         ‘receive attention’; salang-hata                 ‘love’ vs. salang-
pat.ta ‘be loved’; wiim-hata ‘entrust’ vs. wiim-toyta “be entrusted’; kkwucwung-hata
‘scold’ vs. kkwucwung-tut.ta                      “be scolded’; yatan-chita                 ‘scold’ vs. yatan-macta       ‘be
scolded’; may-ttaylita ‘spank’ vs. may-macta ‘be spanked’; and sa.yong-hata ‘use’ vs.
sa.yong-toyta        ‘be used’. Note               that many            of the verbal         nouns     involved   are Sino-
Korean, especially those occurring before tanghata, pat.ta, and toyta.

                       ‘Our soldiers killed the enemy.’

                       ‘The enemy was killed by our soldiers.’      In addition to the suffixal and lexical sets, there are also phrasal passives that
consist of a verb stem followed by the infinitive suffix -e/-a and the inchoative verb
cita “get to be, become’. The basic meaning of -e/-a cita is change of state, as in mul i
malk-a ci-n-ta ‘The water is getting clear.’ With the meaning of change of state intact,
it can also convey passive meaning when it occurs with a transitive verb. Examples
include cwuta ‘give’ vs. cwu-e cita ‘be given’; milwuta ‘postpone’ vs. milwu-e cita
‘be postponed’; mwuluta ‘press’ vs. nwuil-e cita ‘be pressed’; mathkita ‘entrust’ vs.
mathky-e cita ‘be entrusted’; and nemkita ‘pass over to’ vs. nemky-e cita “be passed
over’, Note that while the verb stem toy ‘become’ usually occurs with Sino-Korean
verbal nouns, ci tends to occur with native verbs.

Notice that the agentive in phrasal passive constructions is expressed by the complex
agentive construction ey uyhay ‘by’, and not by ey(key) which has the dative/goal
meaning ‘to’ due to the nature of the predicates which can take a dative/goal case. For
an extensive survey of Korean passives, see I. Woo                       1997.","[378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389]"

9.2.6             Topic-stacking sentences
Along      with single-subject or single-object               sentences,      Korean     abounds       in simple
sentences where more than one ‘subject’ or ‘object’ appear. These sentences are
frequently called multiple-subject (or multiple-nominative) and multiple-object (or
multiple-accusative) constructions, respectively. Multiple-subject constructions are
much more prevalent. H.M. Sohn (1986) places these constructions under the rubric of
multiple-topic constructions.(42)              a.   Mia         ka/nun/to  nwun_            i/unito    hana                ka   khu-ta.
                       Mia         NM/TC/also eye              NM/TC/also one                 NM _ big-DC
                       ‘Mia (also) has one big eye.’
                  b.   na    nun     cwi     lul   han   mali    lul       kkoli   lul        call-ass-ta.
                       I     TC      rat     AC    1     CN      AC        tail    AC         cut-PST-DC
                       ‘I cut the tail of one rat.’
       Korean has a constituent structure rule of the form S — NP S                      (9.3) to account for
productive multiple nominative constructions such as (42a). The NP in this case
cannot be a subject of a predicate verb or adjective even though it is in the nominative
case, but takes the following sentence as a whole as its predicate. This NP may be
called a sentential topic or a sentential subject. Thus, in (42a), Mia is the sentential
topic or subject of the following sentence in which nwun is the sentential topic or
subject of the remaining sentence.
       Korean also has a phrase structure rule of the form V' — NP                       V'     (9.3) to account
for multiple object constructions such as (42b). Notice that cwi ‘rat’ is not the object
of the verb caluta ‘cut’ because the thing that is cut is not the rat but its tail. Thus, cwi
may be regarded as the topic of the following verb phrase, and han mali is the topic of
the rest of the verb phrase. These topics may be termed verb phrase objects since they
are in the accusative case.
       A   wide   variety of nominal           constructions    in sentences       can        be topicalized     as
sentential subjects. Whether a given topic sentence is acceptable or not depends by
and large on the relationship between the topic and the rest of the sentence. In general,
the syntactic and semantic relations between a topic nominal and the following
nominative-marked nominal is anaphoric as in (43a), possessive as in (43b), class-
290               The Korean languagemember        as in (43c),       static location                 as in (43d),         stage-setting as in (43e),     and
quantification as in (43f). Sentence (43g) illustrates stacking of nominals in different
syntactic relations, involving multiple possession and static location.(43)              a.   Mia           nun           caki_         ka                ka-ss-ta.

                       ‘The top of the roof of this house has a hole.’       In a sentence like (44), Mia is considered a scrambled object of the verb since it is
still in the accusative case. Thus, it is not a multiple-topic construction.","[305, 306]"

When a transitive verb is causativized, the resulting sentence is ditransitive, with the
original subject changed to the dative. As in other ditransitive constructions, the dative
case can be changed to an accusative.

      Long-form or phrasal (or periphrastic) causatives are formed with the verb stem
hafy) ‘do, make, cause, let, permit, tell, arrange’ preceded by a complement clause
that ends in the adverbializer -key ‘so that, to’. This type is very productive, in that -
key hata can be used with any type of clause, including even a suffixal passive or
causative construction.

                     ‘I had my older sister show the photo to Mia.’
   There are many semantic and syntactic differences between a long-form causative
and its corresponding short-form suffixal causative. One difference is that long-form
causatives have two lexical items -key and Aa that correspond to a causative suffix in
short-form causatives. In particular, the verb stem Aa denotes not only the ‘cause’
meaning but also other meanings such as ‘do’, ‘make’, ‘force’, ‘order’, ‘ask’, ‘tell’,
‘enable’, ‘permit’, and ‘arrange’. Thus, the combined meanings of -key and ha result
in various degrees of indirect causation, whereas a causative suffix is usually related
to direct or immediate causation.
      Another semantic difference arises when causatives occur with a negative element.
Notice that (195a) and (195b) mean different things, because the scope of the negative
adverbial mos ‘cannot’ covers only the immediately following verb and cannot go
beyond -key.

                   ‘My younger sister did not let the child sleep.’   Still another semantic difference in the two causative types is observed in their
presuppositional properties (C.M. Lee 1973:384). Thus, for instance, (196a)
presupposes the prior existence of the road, but (196b) does not, since in (196b) the
road may come about as a result of the action described. This may be due to the
exclusive ‘cause’ meaning of a causative suffix and to the variety of meanings,
including the ‘creation’ meaning, that the verb stem Aa has.
(196)         a.   inpu     ka        kil    ul           — cop-hy-ess-ta.

                   worker   NM        road   AC             narrow-to      do-PST-DC
                   ‘The workers made the road narrow.’
   Syntactically also, a long-form causative allows two nominatives in a sentence,
one the main clause subject and the other the embedded clause subject, as in Minho ka
[Mia ka wus-key}| hay-ss-e.yo ‘Minho caused Mia to laugh.’ A short-form causative
allows only one subject in the nominative case in a sentence, as in Minho ka Mia
lul/*ka wus-ky-ess-e.yo ‘Minho made Mia laugh.’ This indicates that a long-form
causative is a complex sentence, whereas a short-form causative is a simplex sentence.
   Moreover, while short-form causatives do not allow any element to be inserted
between the stem and the causative suffix (e.g., wus(*-usi)-kita                       ‘make    (someone)
laugh’), long-form causatives allow the subject honorific suffix to be placed between
the stem and -key and the accusative or any delimiter particle to be placed after -key.","[390, 391, 392, 393]"

(138)           a.   ku    ai       nun       ftotwukcil   mace      ha-n-ta.
                     the child TC        theft        even     do-IN-DC
                     ‘That child goes as far as committing theft.’                b.   Mia    nun emeni         eykey   na    ka-n _    tus-i     kipp-ess-ta.
                     Mia TC mother to           orso go-RL asif       happy-PST-DC
                     ‘Mia was happy as if she had gone to her mother or something.’      The following sentences illustrate the occurrence of delimiters with adverbs (139a,
b) and complement clauses (139c).
346             The Korean language(139)           a.   Tongmin.i            nun       phek    to           coh-a           hay-ss-e.

                     “Tongmin indeed showed his happiness.’
                b. ppalli          man          ka-myen     toy-n-ta.
                     early         only         go-if       O.K.-IN-DC
                     ‘It’s okay only if (you) go early.’
                c.   man       Mia eykey nay sin                 ul    sin-key      kkaci nun hay-ss-ta.
                     I TC Mia to          my shoe AC wear-AD upto                             TC      do-PST-DC
                     ‘I did as much as letting Mia wear my shoes.’      Delimiters can occur with case particles in noun phrases, as shown in (138b) where
the ‘alternative’ delimiter na ‘rather, or something’ occurs with the goal case particle
eykey. Also, two or more delimiters may occur in sequence, in which case there are
certain fixed orders among them.
      I.S. Yang (1972) proposes that there are three sets of delimiters, that occur in the
order of X, Y, and Z, where X includes mace ‘even, also, so far as, on top of, mata
‘each, every, all’, kkaci ‘till, up to, even, as far as’, and puthe                         ‘starting from’; Y
includes man ‘only, just’, cocha ‘even, as well’, and pakkey ‘except for, outside of’;
and Z includes (n)un ‘as for, regarding’ (topic-contrast marker), fo ‘also, too, indeed’,
(i)ya ‘as only for’, (i)na ‘or the like, or so, or something, about’, (i)/ato ‘even, even if,
as a last recourse’, and (i)yamallo ‘the very, no other than’. In addition, we have
khenyeng ‘far from doing or being, let alone’ that occurs after (n)un. From each set, at
most one member can occur within a noun phrase. Observe the following sentences
that illustrate delimiter stacking and delimiter-case cooccurrence.
(140)           a.   sip     pen          kkaci     man    un     ppop-ca.
                     10      ono.                   only   TC     select-PR
                     *Let’s select only up to no. 10.’                b.   Nami eykey nun khenyeng Mia eykey cocha to                              an      ka-ss-e.yo.
                     Namito        TC farfrom      Méiato      even also not go-PST-POL
                     ‘(1) didn’t even go to Mia, let alone to Nami.’      Z delimiters, all of which show a high degree of topicality, take the same slot as
syntactic case particles such as the nominative, accusative, and genitive. Therefore,
particles from both sets cannot cooccur. For instance, sequences like *ttek-un/to/iya-
ilulfuy or *ttek-i/ul/uy-un/to/iya                ‘as for/also/as     only    for rice    cake’      (nominative/

accusative/genitive) are ungrammatical.
   Among the delimiters, the topic-contrast delimiter (nJun ‘as for, concerning’ has
been most extensively discussed in the literature since its use is the most widespread
and its meaning is not easy to determine. In particular, when it appears in the subject
position with a topic sense (roughly ‘as for’), its meaning can hardly be distinguished
from the neutral (i.c., not exclusive) meaning of the nominative case particle i/ka.","[361, 362, 363]"
"(47)          A:      eti            ka-sey-yo?
                      where          go-SH-POL
                      “Where are (you) going?’
292            The Korean language               B:    pyengwen     ey com _ ka-yo.
                     hospital     to just        go-POL
                     ‘(1) am going to the hospital.’      Expressive (phatic or aknowledgement) speech acts such as apology, thanking,
greeting, and congratulation are typically used without a subject, as in sillyeyha-p-ni-
ta ‘Excuse (me)’, mianha-p-ni-ta ‘(I) am sorry’, coysongha-p-ni-ta ‘([) am very sorry’
(lit. ‘(1) feel guilty’), kKomap-sup-ni-ta ‘Thank (you)’, kamsaha-p-ni-ta (1) appreciate
(it)’, annyengha-sey-yo? ‘How are (you)?’, and chwukhaha-p-ni-ta ‘Congratulations!’
Using the subject renders these expressions either awkward or unacceptable. For
instance, *cey ka komap-sup-ni-ta ‘I thank you’ is unacceptable.
    Aside from such subjectless sentences where the subject is omitted but imaginable,
real subjectless sentences are rare in Korean. Some possible candidates are presented
in (48).(48)           a.   [sensayng-nim       i        o-si-n]          kes    _— kath-ta.
                    teacher-HT          NM       come-SH-RL       fact       same-DC
                    ‘It seems that the teacher has come.’
               b.   [wuli      apeci    nun      ilpon     ulo   ttena-si-l]           ke     y-eyyo.

                    ‘My father will leave for Japan.’
               c.   f[hal.apeci    ka       hayngpokha-si-n|      ka           po-a.yo.
                     grandpa   NM_happy-SH-RL                     whether      seem-POL
                    ‘Grandpa appears to be happy.’               d.   [halmeni      ka        tolaka-si-n}   tus    — ha-ta.
                     grandma NM_        die-SH-RL     asif   appear-DC
                    ‘It appears that grandma has passed away.’
Notice in (48) that the adjectives kathta ‘be same’, ita ‘be’, pota ‘seem’, and hata
‘appear’ lack a corresponding subject. This is evidenced by the fact that the subject
honorific suffix -(u)si occurs only in the embedded clause predicates whose subjects
also appear in the embedded clauses. The sentences in (48) suggest that the bold-faced
predicates have become so grammaticalized with the preceding elements that they
have lost their ability to carry their own subject.

9.2.8             Word orderAs an SOV language, Korean has the basic and neutral word order of subject, object,
and verb/adjective. This order holds in both main and embedded clauses. Due to the
basic SOV order, all modifiers including determiners, genitive constructions, relative
and complement clauses, and conjunctive clauses precede their head elements. Case
and delimiter particles always follow the nominals they are associated with, These
orders are fixed and do not allow any variation. Among                noun phrases that carry
various cases, however, there seems to be a preferred or neutral word order. Roughly,
the order in (49) appears to obtain. Note that case markers are optionally or
obligatorily deleted in certain syntactic collocations.","[307, 308, 309]"

"Rule L        Initial consonant deletion
   Korean has many nominal particles and verbal suffixes that have two forms, whose
occurrence is conditioned by phonological environments. One form of a particle or a
suffix begins with a consonant and the other without that consonant. This has been
observed in connection with + deletion where i is deleted after a stem ending in a
vowel, as in cip ulo cip-ilo ‘to the house’ vs. cha lo cha-lo ‘to the car’ and coh-un
coh-in ‘good’ ys. ki-n ki-n ‘long’. As in the case of + deletion, the initial consonant
in certain morphemes is deleted after a vowel, as shown in (63a). In certain other
morphemes, the consonant is deleted after a consonant, as in (63b). The morphemes in
question include the comitative particle (k)wa ‘and, with’, the blunt level sentence
ender -(s)o, the addressee honorific suffix -(su)p, the topic-contrast particle (n)un, and
the accusative particle (/)ul. In the addressee honorific suffix -(su)p -(si)p, the vowel
+ also gets deleted, due to the + deletion discussed under Rule F.

7.5              Rhythmic patterns
7.5.1           Length, stress, pitch
As already mentioned in 7.2.2, there is phonemic vowel length in the speech of older
Koreans that differentiates lexical items, as in say s€ ‘new’ vs. say se: ‘bird’, pal pal
‘foot’ vs. pal paz} ‘screen’, pay pe ‘pear’ vs. pay pe: ‘double’, swul sul ‘wine’ vs.
swul su:l ‘tassel’, and ko/ kol ‘marrow’ vs. kol ko:l ‘valley’.
       In addition, vowels (sometimes even consonants) may be lengthened for emphatic
or connotative purposes. While a lexical long vowel is usually twice the length of a
simple vowel, emphatic or connotative length is usually longer and varies depending
on the speaker’s emotional intensity, and thus may be represented as ::. For emphatic
purposes, length is attached to the first syllable of a word to be emphasized, even to an
already long vowel.

representing the speaker’s delicate feelings or presuppositions (e.g., surprise, apology,

certain characteristic pitch levels, occurs on the vowel or nasal or lateral consonant of
the last syllable of a major nominal phrase or an utterance. In (66), t’o:: has an
emphatic length, while -éjo:: has a connotative length, conveying a presupposition
such as ‘contrary to my expectation’. A recent tendency in conversations is that young
females use extra connotative lengthening on phrase-final syllables,
(66)             ku salam      i      tto      w-ass-e.yo?
                 the person    NM     again    come-PST-POL
                 ‘Are you saying that he came again?! Incredible!’
                 (lit. ‘Did he come again?’)
                 ki salam-i t’0:: w-as’-9jo::?
                 [ki.sa.fa.mi,t’o::.wa.s’8.jo::~]
   Lexical stress is not significant in Korean, because it does not contribute to
meaning differentiation. Feeble as it may be, non-phonemic stress normally occurs on
the first syllable of an intonational phrase, especially when that syllable ends in a
consonant, as in hakca-nin [hak.c’a.nin] ‘as for scholars’. The initial syllable is
known as the locus of intonational prominence in Korean (H.S. Koo 1986). Thus,
phonemic long vowels, which are allowed only in phrase-initial syllables, receive
stress. If the phrase-initial syllable ends in a simple vowel and the second syllable has
an onset (e.g., CV(C)), the second syllable tends to receive stress, as in onil-to
[o.nil.do] ‘today also’. On the other hand, a speaker may put stress on any word
which he thinks is relatively important or needs to be emphasized or focused. Except
for these occurrences, stress is distributed more or less evenly.
       Significant lexical pitches (or tones) existed in Middle Korean. These were musical
tones accompanying vowels in words in an utterance, but they have since disappeared,
except in the Kyengsang and Hamkyeng dialects (see 4.2.1 and 7.5.3). Thus,
Contemporary Korean pitches in all other dialects and standard speech are related to
the intonation contours of utterances, and not to lexical items.","[211, 212, 213]"

    The desiderative construction with the adjective siphta ‘be wishful, be desirable,
wish’ is a peculiar type of sensory construction. First, the adjective must be preceded
by a clause, which is its object. Second, this object clause is nominalized by the
gerundive suffix -ko. Third, when the clause before -ko siphta is transitive, the object
of the embedded verb may be marked with either a nominative or an accusative
particle. When siph-e hata occurs, the object is always in the accusative case.

9.10,3.2      Benefactive constructionsBenefactive constructions are formed by an action verb followed by the infinitive
suffix -e/-a and a benefactive auxiliary verb which denotes benefaction towards the
recipient. Benefactive auxiliary verbs are derived without formal change from
donatory (i.e., giving) verbs, which are of three kinds: cwuta (plain), tulita (humble),
and ta(l)- (reflexive). The reflexive form occurs mostly in the imperative quotative
construction, and only when the benefaction is intended for the speaker. It may occur
in the main clause (limited to the blunt speech level as in (205d)), along with cwuta or
tulita, although this sounds old-fashioned. When used as an auxiliary, all these verbs
of giving carry the benefactive meaning ‘(do) for (someone)’.(205)         a.   Tongmin.i               nun    Milan.i       lul    tow-a          cwu-ess-ta.

   Grammaticalization of a benefactive auxiliary verb from a full donatory verb in
complex predicate constructions manifests at least three stages. The first stage is that
of a donatory verb which retains its original meaning of giving, as in (206a), In this
function, it retains its full argument structure as <agent, theme, goal>. The second
stage is that of a benefactive verb with argument structure <agent, goal> as in (206b).
Notice that chayk is the theme of pAyeta, and not of tulita. The third stage is that of
constructions where the auxiliary verb cannot be related to a goal case, i.e., the stage
of the argument structure <agent> as in (206c).

                       ‘I went to the market for mother.’Notice that the benefactive auxiliary verb can no longer be associated with the goal
case    in   (206d).       In    such      cases,            the     benefactor          is   situationally     or     contextually
understood, or can be expressed by a conjunctive structure such as emeni lul wihay
‘for the sake of mother’. Development into this third stage is due to the nature of the
embedded (first) verbs. For instance, certain transitive verbs (e.g., phyeta ‘open’) are
386                 The Korean languagemore     receptive to the goal case than others (e.g., fat.ta ‘close’) and, in general,
intransitive verbs (e.g., kata ‘go’) are more readily grammaticalized than transitive
verbs. For recent in-depth studies on Korean benefactive constructions, sce Shibatani

9.4.5             Nominalized constructionsFunctioning syntactically as a nominal, a nominalized clause is embedded within the
sentence to which it is subordinate.                A nominalized clause is different from a relative
clause in that it does not have a head noun but only a nominalizer suffix (NOM) and
from a conjunctive or complement clause in that it functions as a grammatical case
such     as nominative,       accusative,        dative,    locative,      genitive,       etc.    There    are   several
nominalizer suffixes. The suffix -ki ‘the act of, the fact that’ is the most frequently
used one, and it occurs in many syntactic functions and combinations.
(92)              a.   na nun [ku salam          tasi      manna-ki]                       (ka)     musew-ess-ta.

                       ‘I was afraid of seeing him again.’                  b. pi         ka        [o-ki]               sicak. hay-ss-ta.
                       rain     NM            come-NOM_        start-PST-DC
                       ‘It started raining.’
320             The Korean language                c.   [nwun      i    w-ass-ki]                           ey   sukhi         tha-le       ka-ss-e.
                      snow      NM _ come-PST-NOM                        at   skii          ride-to     go-PST-INT
                     ‘Since it had snowed, (I) went skiing.’
                d.   [palam     i _ sey-ss-ki]                          tlaymun      ey cip           ey iss-ess-ni?
                     wind       NM        strong-PST-NOM reason                      at     homeat        stay-PST-Q
                     ‘Did (you) stay home because the wind was strong?’
      Notice in (92a, b) that the nominalized clauses cannot have the past/perfect suffix
(PST) despite the past tense of the main clause predicate. This is because the events
denoted     by the nominalized            clauses cannot           precede        the main       clause events.        No
sequence of tense is applicable to Korean. In (92c, d), the event of the nominalized
clause precedes the main clause event, and hence the past/perfect suffix appears.
    A variant of the nominalizer -ki seems to be -ko which appears obligatorily before
the desiderative adjective siphta ‘be wishful’. Compare the two sentences below and
observe the parallelism between -ki and -ko.
(93)            a.   [ku      yeca         Tul        tto        manna-ki|         __ silh-e.yo.
                     the      woman        AC        again       meet-NOM                 ehateful-POL
                     ‘(1) don’t want to see her again.’
                b.   [ku      yeca          lul      tto         manna-ko|         _ siph-e.yo.
                      the     woman         AC       again       meet-NOM             wishful-POL
                     *(1) want to see her again.’
      The nominalizer -ci occurs before a negative adverb (an ‘not’, mos ‘cannot’) or the
negative verb malta ‘stop, don’t do’, as illustrated in (94), Occurrence of -ci only
before a negative element has led some linguists to speculate that this suffix and -ki
are allomorphic      variants, the former                   occurring    before a negative              and   the   latter
elsewhere.
(94)            a.   Nami       nun _— [wul-ci]                   an-h-ass-e.yo.

   The nominalizer suffix -(u)m ‘the act or fact of being/doing’ is usually used before
a ‘cognitive’        verb   such   as alta     ‘know’,     moluta       ‘not know’,     kkaytat.ta       ‘realize’,
hwak.inhata     ‘confirm’, palkyenhata            ‘discover’, kiek.hata        ‘remember’,           cimcak.hata
‘guess’, nukkita ‘feel’, allita ‘inform’, and palk.hita ‘reveal’.

                        ‘The criminal was found to have committed suicide.’
   The semantico-syntactic difference between -ki and -(u)m has been a controversial
topic. In general, -ki clauses denote non-factivity to describe an event yet to be
realized, whereas -(u)m clauses are more closely related to factivity to describe a
factual event. Accordingly, they tend to cooccur with non-factive and factive main
predicates, respectively, as shown in (96).
(96)            a.      nanun      [hyeng i       sakitanghay-ss-um(/*-ki)| ul — al-ass-ta.

                        ‘I didn’t like seeing her.’   Many main clause predicates, including those indicating judgement, are neutral,
occurring with both -Ai and -(u)Jm. Notice in (97) that the verb falli-ta ‘depend (on)’
can occur with both nominalizers.(97)            a.     sengkong          un _ {[nolyek.ha-m]             ey   tally-e               iss-ta.

                        ‘Success depends on one’s making efforts.’                b.     sengkong          un _ [nolyek.ha-ki] ey               tally-e               iss-ta.

                        ‘Success depends on how one makes efforts.’
322               The Korean languageIn general, sentences with the suffix -(u)m sound rather formal. In casual speech, it is
often replaced with a relative clause (the fact-S type) with the head noun kes ‘fact,
thing’, as in ney-huy nun haksayng i-n kes ul al-ala ‘Keep in mind that you guys are
students.’
9.4.6             Quotative constructionsA quotative construction is similar to a verbal complement construction in that both
are closely tied to the main predicate, complementing the latter. Notice the parallelism
between (98a) which contains a quotative clause and (98b) which contains a verbal
complement clause.
(98)              a.   emeni      nun    hyeng         eykey     [ppalli       ttena-la           ko]     hay-ss-ta.
                       mother     TC     brother to               quickly      leave-IM           QT      do-PST-DC
                       ‘My mother told my older brother to leave quickly.’                  b.   emeni      nun    hyeng         eykey     [ppalli       ttena-key]          hay-ss-ta.
                       mother     TC     brother to               quickly      leave-AD            do-PST-DC
                       ‘My mother caused my older brother to leave quickly.’
       As noticed in the above examples, one major difference is that a quotative
construction ends in a predicate with a neutral-level sentence ender (e.g., declarative,
interrogative, propositive or imperative), whereas a verbal complement                                     ends in a
clause ender. Thus, the former is followed by a quotative particle, whereas the latter is
followed     by    a complementizer          suffix.    A      second   difference        is that         a quotative
construction is more freely scrambled with other nominal elements, which                                        is not
generally possible in the case of a complement construction.
(99)              a.   [ppalli    ttena-la    ko]      emeni      nun       hyeng         eykey        matlhay-ss-ta.

                       ‘My mother told my older brother to leave quickly.’
                  b.   ?[ppalli    ttena-key|       emeni        nun       hyeng     eykey         hay-ss-ta.

                                                          brother to       do-PST-DC
                        “My mother caused my older brother to leave quickly.’    A third difference is that, while quotative clauses allow tense suffixes to occur
freely, complement clauses are subject to the control of the main predicate tense.

There are many other properties unique to quotative clauses, as described below,
which warrant grouping them as a separate embedded clause type.
   Quotative    constructions       primarily     include   reporting,      saying,     writing,   asking,
suggesting, ordering, and promising but secondarily hearing, thinking, and believing
as well. For the sake of convenience, let us term all the predicates that are used to
report, say, hear, think, and believe in quotative constructions as quoting verbs, which
are of the following kinds.(101)          a.   cekta ‘write down’                           chinghata ‘call, term’

   There   are two     ways      to report   what      someone    has    stated,    asked,    commanded,
suggested, or promised: a direct quotation, which reports the exact words spoken or
written, and an indirect quotation, which reports only the content. All the examples
given above are cases of indirect quotation. Direct quotation in Korean is used much
less frequently than in English.
324              The Korean language      In direct quotation, the quoted expression (which contains the exact words spoken,
written, conceived, or believed) is followed by the particle hako ‘saying’ (derived
from the verb stem ha ‘say’ and the conjunctive suffix ko ‘and’) or lako ‘saying’
(derived probably from the copulative declarative (i)/a and the contracted form of
hako), and ends with a quoting verb. In general, hako sounds more colloquial than

are often used without counters and the genitive particle, as in haksayng twul or twu
haksayng ‘two students’ and Ayengcey seys or sey hyengcey ‘three brothers’, but this

                                               (2))   During this period, some new morphological and syntactic devices developed. For
instance, the nominalizer suffix -i (< -oj/2/) which had been used productively in
Middle Korean ceased to be productive. Instead, -(¢)m and -ki began to be widely
used, as in ti/m (t2/-m) ‘entering’ and kaki (ka-ki) ‘going’. Many nominal stems were
considerably simplified, as observed in the loss of the word-final A in many Middle
Korean words, such as folh (> tol) ‘stone’ and kilh (> kil) ‘road’. The nominative case
particle ka, which had been developed only in written Korean at the end of the Middle
Korean period, came to be used widely in both spoken and written Korean.
   The new past tense suffix -as'/as’ which had been grammaticalized from the
existential construction -9/a isi (> -9/a is’) ‘be in the state of during the Middle
Korean period began to be used generally, as in poné-as'-ta ‘sent’. Similarly, the
modal verbal suffix -kes’ which denotes the speaker/hearer’s volition, conjecture, or
futurity derived from the past periphrastic causative construction -ke hoj-as’ ‘to have
caused to’ in the eighteenth century. A host of case and delimiter particles as well as
verbal   suffixes   have   also derived    through           grammaticalization        from    a verbal    or
nominal construction following a pattern similar to the Middle Korean derivation of
cocha ‘even’ (< coch ‘follow’ + the infinitive suffix -a) and puthe                       ‘from’ (< pith
‘stick to’ + the infinitive suffix -@). Suffice it here to present some frequently used
examples: the comitative case particle hako ‘and, with’ (from the verb stem ha ‘do’ +
the conjunctive suffix -ko ‘and’), the dative case particle poko ‘to’ (from the verb stem
po ‘see’ + the conjunctive suffix -ko), the delimiter particle pak’e ‘except’ (from the
noun pak’ ‘outside’ + the locative particle e ‘at’), and the transferentive suffix -taka
‘and then’ (from the verb stem tak ‘approach’ + the infinitive suffix -a).
   Many native words went out of use due to the continuous influx of a large number
of Chinese words and the formation of new words based on Chinese characters. For
instance, native words like mo (< moj) ‘mountain’, kalam (< kolom) ‘river’, and azom
‘relative’ were replaced by Sino-Korean words san, kay, and chinchek, respectively.
This happened throughout the Middle and Modern Korean periods. On the other hand,
new Western cultural words began to be introduced into the Korean vocabulary in the
Modern Korean period, largely due to the importation of a variety of books on science
and religion as well       as other cultural        items,    and    through   contacts   with   foreigners
visiting or residing in Korea.       For more discussions on lexical replacements,                        see

56                 The Korean language   Regarding Contemporary Korean, twentieth century Korea has had an
unprecedentedly complex history: the entry of missionaries, the collision between
foreign     powers    in Korea,    Japanese   domination      of Korea       for thirty-five     years,
liberation from Japanese rule, division into North and South Korea, wide international
contacts,    the   Korean   War,   rapid   economic   and    technological     growth,    and    social
transformation in recent decades. All these events have had various effects on the
Korean language.
   During the Japanese         occupation,    patriotic     grammarians      and   literary    scholars
endeavored to maintain and standardize the use of the Korean language. Monumental
events include the Korean Language Society’s development of a Unified Spelling
System in 1933, codification of a standard vocabulary in 1936, and compilation of a
Korean language dictionary, entitled Khun Sacen ‘The Great Dictionary’ (six volumes
with 164,125 entries) that was initiated in 1929 and first published in 1947.
     The description of Contemporary Korean is the main concern of the rest of this
volume.
              4               Dialects
 This chapter surveys the dialectal divisions of Korean, salient phonological isoglosses,
 typical features of each dialect, and the phenomena of linguistic divergence between
 South and North Korea. All Korean expressions including linguistic examples and
 proper names are transcribed in Yale romanization. Thus, for instance, the
 southernmost island province of Korea is spelled as Ceycwu instead of the widely
 used McCune—Reischauer-based romanization Cheju.","[70, 71, 72, 73]"
"   As shown in the above examples, Korean reflexives occur in the direct or indirect
object position, copular complement position, and possessive and other case positions.
Unlike in English, Korean reflexives may also occur as the subject of an embedded
clause as in (240a) and (241a). In such cases, Korean reflexives usually correspond to
English personal pronouns. For more on anaphoric phenomena in Korean, see W.C.M.

9,12            Adverbial constructionsAdverbials     are those       sentential constituents       which     modify   a predicate,   a clause,
another adverbial, or even a nominal, in terms of negation, attribution (time, place,
manner,     degree),    modality,        conjunction,   and discourse situations (cf. 8.1.1;      8.1.8).
Some adverbials may belong to two or more of these subclasses. For instance, palo is
a time adverbial in the sense of ‘immediately’, a manner adverbial in the sense of
‘straightly, directly’, and a modal adverbial in the sense of ‘rightly, the very’.
      Since adverbials are functionally defined notions, they include not only lexically
inherent or derived adverbs, but also nouns, noun phrases, and clauses which function
               9 Grammatical structure                                                                  395
adverbially. In a broad sense, adverbials may include all case-marked nouns which
modify predicates in one way or another. In the following description, however, case-
marked   nouns will not be discussed to avoid repetition, except for those which are
fossilized as adverbs such as ffayttay-/o ‘from time to time’ (derived from ttay ‘time’
+ ttay ‘time’ + lo ‘with’).
   Adverbials can be followed by delimiters, such as (n)jun ‘as for’, to ‘even, also,
indeed’, and man ‘only’, which delimit or specify the adverbial meanings, as in ppalli
man ka-myen toy-n-ta ‘It will be fine if only (we) go fast’.
   Adverbials always occur before the modified elements, preferably immediately
before them. As long as they precede the modified element, adverbials can often be
scrambled with clause-mate nominals for stylistic or connotational reasons. When the
modified word is a copula, however, the adverbial cannot occur immediately before it,
but must precede the complement since a copula and its complement are inseparable,
as in Mia nun hangsang haksayng i-ta ‘Mia is always a student.’ In (223), the time
adverbial onul can be freely scrambled with the nominals,                            the   connotational
differences being that onu/ modifies what follows it in each case.(223)          a.   onul      Milani     nun          Yengkwuk     ulo _ ttena-ss-ta.
                    today     Milan      TC        England         to        leave-PST-DC
                    ‘Milan left for England today.’

                    Yengkwuk ulo Milan.i nun onul ttena-ss-ta,    Adverbials occur recursively in a sentence. One or more adverbials may modify
another adverbial or a predicate. When different types of adverbials cooccur, the
natural order among them is modal, time, place, degree, and manner.

                    ‘The students get together quietly once every month,’   Negative    adverbials     were     discussed      in the     preceding    section      (9.11).   Other
adverbials will be taken up in the following subsections.
396             The Korean language9.12.1          Attributive adverbials: time, place, manner, and degreeAttributive adverbials, as stated in Choy 1965:579, modify the attribute or property of
the action or state of the predicate in terms of time, place, manner, or degree. Time
adverbials indicate points of time (e.g., onul ‘today’, cikum ‘now’, encey ‘when?’),
duration (e.g., nul ‘always’, olay ‘long’, yengyeng ‘forever’), relative time (e.g., imi
‘already’, ilccik ‘early’, acik ‘yet, still’), and repetition/frequency (e.g., ittakum
‘sometimes’, mayil ‘everyday’, congcong ‘often’). Place adverbials indicate location
(e.g., yeki ‘here’, kos-kos-i ‘every place’, eti ‘where?’), direction (e.g., i/i ‘this way’,
celi ‘that way’), and distance (e.g., melli ‘far away’, kakkai ‘near’).
      Manner adverbials denote various manners in which the action or state denoted by
the predicate is to be manifested. They may be either lexical or clausal, the former
being subdivided into those which are not onomatopocic (e.g., ca/ ‘well’, ecci ‘how?’,
ese ‘quickly’, ppal-li ‘quickly, fast’, ijpule ‘on purpose’, makwu ‘carelessly’, manh-i
‘much’, kiph-i ‘deeply’) and those which are (e.g., ttok-ttok ‘with snaps’, thang-thang
‘bang-bang’, wul/kus-pulkus ‘colourfully’).
    Lexical manner adverbials normally occur immediately before a modified
predicate, but can be scrambled with nominals as in Mia nun ppal-li cip ulo ka-ss-ta
‘Mia went home quickly’, although it becomes unnatural if they precede the subject as
in ?ppal-li Mia nun cip ulo ka-ss-ta. Onomatopoeic adverbials were discussed in 5.3.
    Clausal manner adverbials have several subtypes. First, the adverbializer -i may be
suffixed to an embedded clause element, as in [cwi cwuk-un tus-i] co.yongha-ta ‘It is
as quiet as if rats were dead’, [ca.yu ka eps-i] nun mos sa-n-ta ‘(We) cannot live
without freedom’, and [nwun i o-l kes kath-i) nalssi ka chwup-ta ‘It is cold, as if it is
going to snow.’ Second, the adverbial suffix -key ‘so that’ can be attached to an
embedded      clause predicate. In fact, all predicates (except for the copula) can be
adverbialized with this suffix, some being more idiomatized than others,(225)           kam          i     [acwu   pulk-key|    ik-ess-kwun.
                persimmon NM     very    red-AD        ripe-PST-APP
                ‘The persimmons are red ripe.’
Third, the infinitive suffix -e/-a and the conjunctive suffix -ko ‘and’ also adverbialize
the preceding clause to function as a complement clause, as in Mia ka [ceyil cak-a]
po-i-n-ta ‘Mia looks the smallest’ and tongsayng i [ki lul tul-ko] w-a.yo ‘My younger
brother is coming holding a flag.’
      Degree adverbials denote a qualitative or quantitative degree of the state or action
indicated by the predicate. Lexical examples are phek ‘very’, kkway ‘considerably’,
keuy ‘almost’, kacang ‘most’, camos ‘exceedingly’, hato ‘excessively’, ssek ‘awfully,
                 9 Grammatical structure                                                                       397
greatly’, maywu ‘very’, cham ‘truly, really’, acwu ‘very, quite, really’, Awelssin ‘by

‘extremely’, and taytan-hi ‘very’. All degree adverbials occur before an adjective,                                  a
manner adverb, or another degree adverb, as in phek kiph-ta ‘(It) is very deep’ and
hwelssin      te noph-i     nall-ass-ta      ‘({t) flew much         higher’.     Some      degree     adverbials
precede a verb if the verb is derived from an adjective as in Mia lul cikuk-hi coh-a-
ha-n-ta ‘(He) likes Mia very much’, if the adverb itself denotes quantity as in pak.kan
wumciki-n-ta      ‘moves        a little’, or if a manner adverbial             is understood,        as in nemu
(ppal-li) talli-n-ta ‘runs overly (fast)’.
     Degree    adverbials       such     as cen-hye     ‘absolutely,     at all’, kutaci/kuli          ‘so   much,
particularly’, yekan ‘ordinarily’, and i-man ce-man ‘in no small degree’ are negative
polarity items (9.11.1). The ‘projective’ suffix -tolok ‘so that, to the extent that’ is a
typical example that forms a clausal degree adverbial.(226)            enni     nun       [pyeng       i       na-tolok}       yelsimhi          kongpuhay-ss-ta.
                 sister TC    sickness NM _ occur-AD hard                study-PST-DC
                 ‘My older sister studied hard to the extent that she got sick.’
9.12.2           Modal adverbialsModal adverbials are concerned with the speaker’s feeling, opinion, or attitude.
Accordingly, they usually modify a clause or sentence as a whole. Modal adverbials
are different from attributive ones in that the latter are related to the property of the
modified element whereas the former concerns the speaker’s modality. They are
however morphologically similar to each other. Sometimes, the same adverbial can be
both attributive and modal. For instance, Awaksil-hi is a manner adverbial in the sense
of ‘for sure’ (Milan.i nun hwaksil-hi a-n-ta ‘Milan correctly knows (it)’) and a modal
adverbial in the sense of ‘surely/certainly’ (hwaksil-hi Milan.i nun yeyppu-ta ‘Surely,
Milan is pretty’).
    Modal adverbials may be classified into four general types: assertive (e.g., ceypal
‘please’, kuyamailo ‘indeed, truly’, kwa.yen ‘indeed’, kyelkwuk ‘after all’, mullon ‘of
course’, puti ‘at any cost’, sillo ‘indeed’, totaychey ‘on earth’, yeksi ‘after all’),
exclusive (e.g., kkok ‘surely’, ocik ‘only’, oloci ‘only’, taman ‘only’, tanci ‘merely,
simply’),     descriptive       (e.g.,   cayswu-eps-i     ‘unluckily’,     chalali        ‘rather’,    com    ‘just,
please’, eccayse ‘why’, machim ‘fortunately’, tahayng-hi ‘fortunately’, way ‘why’),
and hypothetical (e.g., ama ‘maybe’, hoksi ‘by any chance’, kulssey ‘well’, machi ‘as
if, manil ‘if’, selma ‘on no account’, se/sa ‘even if’).
     Exclusive modal adverbials modify noun phrases, occurring immediately before
them (9.12.3). The most natural syntactic position of the other modal adverbials is at
398              The Korean languagethe beginning of the clause or right after the subject, although they can be scrambled
for stylistic reasons.

                       ‘Unfortunately, the thief has not been caught.’

                       ‘Mia will never lose in the match.’
      Different modal adverbials manifest different syntactic peculiarities. For instance,
kyelkho      ‘by any    means’    and cokum-to              ‘at all’ are negative         polarity     items,      thus
occurring only with a negative construction; machi ‘as if occurs with suppositive
predicates      such     as   tus-hata        ‘it    appears’       and    kes   kathta      ‘it     seems’;           and
man.il/man.yak/kasalkalyeng ‘if occur only with a conditional or concessive clause
ending in -myen ‘if’ or ‘-fe)to ‘even if’.
      While most negative polarity items occur with any negative construction, i/wu ‘by
any means, (cannot) possibly’ occurs only with the impossibility formula -(u)/ swu
epsta ‘cannot’, as in cwuk-un salam un ilwu ta sey-l swu eps-e.yo “The dead people
are simply too numerous to count.’
9.12.3           Nominal-modifying adverbials
There are adverbials that modify a noun phrase, many of which are degree and modal
adverbials. Degree adverbials such as fe ‘more’, kacang ‘most’, cokum ‘a little’, acwu
‘very’, and Awelssin ‘far more’ can modify a noun phrase that contains a semantic
component      susceptible to degree, such as an adjectival meaning.                           For instance, in
te/kacang sin-hyeng ul sa-ss-ta ‘bought the newer/newest model’ and acwu papo ta
‘is a complete fool’, sin-hyeng ‘new model’ has a semantic component [NEW]                                             and
papo ‘fool’ has a semantic component [FOOLISH]. In cokum tong ulo ka-la ‘Go a
little eastward!” and Awelssin twi lul po-ala ‘Look far more backward!’, tong ‘east’
means ‘eastward direction’ and ftwi ‘back’ means ‘backward direction’, and thus can
be talked about in terms of degree.
      Manner/degree adverbials like Ayewu ‘barely’, kocak ‘at most’, and keuy ‘almost’
can occur not only with a numeral construction, as in koki Jul keuy yel mali cap-ass-ta
‘caught almost ten fish’, but also with a noun phrase that denotes an object being
implicitly compared with other objects, as in Ayewu yenphil man pat-ass-ta ‘received
only pencils’.

   Modal adverbials such as kkok ‘surely’, palo ‘rightly, precisely’, oloci ‘only’, tanci
‘simply’, hankas ‘simply’, taman ‘only, merely’, and ocik ‘only’ can occur with a
noun phrase to refer to uniqueness, as in Mia nun wuli cip palo iwus ey sal-a.yo ‘Mia
lives right in our neighbourhood.’
9.12.4              Conjunctive adverbials
Conjunctive adverbials conjoin one sentence to another. Many of them have derived
from conjunctive clauses with slight phonological change. For instance, kuliko ‘and’,
kulena ‘but’, kulemyen ‘then’, and kulayto ‘nevertheless’ are fossilized respectively
from the conjunctive clauses kuli ha-ko ‘did it and’, kule ha-na ‘(it) is so, but’, kule
ha-myen         ‘if (it) is so’, and kule hay-to ‘even if (we) do so’. The adverb kulemulo
‘therefore’       can    be associated     with   kule ha-mulo     ‘since    (it) is so’, where         -mulo,
although currently used as a conjunctive suffix with the meaning ‘since, as’, is
analysed into the nominalizer -m and the instrument case particle ulo ‘with’. Other
conjunctive words include ku-lay-se ‘therefore’, ku-leh-ciman ‘however’, ku-leh-ta-
myen ‘if so’, ku-le-na ce-le-na ‘at any rate’, ku-le-nikka ‘therefore’, ani-myen ‘if not’,
cuk     ‘that     is’,   Aok-un    ‘or’,   tekwuntana     ‘besides’,      tewuki    ‘moreover’,        ttal-ase
‘accordingly’, tto-han ‘likewise’, and ftto-nun ‘or’. Notice that demonstratives,
especially ku ‘that’, are widely used to form lexical conjunctive adverbials.
    Conjunctive adverbials are placed at the beginning of a sentence which is
semantically conjoined to the preceding sentence, as in hyeng i ttena-ss-e. kulayse
hyengswu-nim i oylow-usy-e ‘My older brother left. So, his wife is lonely.’
9.12.5              Discoursal adverbialsDiscoursal adverbials are so termed not only because they occur syntactically outside
the boundary of a sentence but also because they are conditioned by discourse contexts
or speech situations. Usually, they either occur alone, or precede a sentence, as a yes
or no response, an address, or an interjection.
      Yes/no     responses     are made      by expressions      like onya     [plain], ung       [intimate],
yey/ney [polite] ‘Yes’; kuleh-ta [plain], kulay [intimate], kuleh-ney [familiar], kuleh-so
[blunt],    Aulay-yo       [polite],   kKuleh-sup-ni-ta   [deferential]     “Yes,   that’s   right’;    ani-ta
[plain], ani(-ya) [intimate], ani-ney [familiar], ani-(y)o [blunt, polite], ani-eyyo [polite],
ani-p-ni-ta [deferential] ‘No’; and chenman-ey [intimate], chenman-ey-yo [polite] “Not
at all’. Notice that all of these words represent speech levels, some inherently and
others with a sentence ender that reflects a speech level.
    The most frequently used terms in the polite speech level are yey/ney ‘yes’ and ani-
(yJo ‘no’, which do not mean ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in the English sense, but rather ‘that’s
correct; I understand’ and ‘that’s incorrect’, respectively.
400             The Korean language(228)           a.   A:   hak.kyo        ey an             ka-ni?
                          school         to         not    go-Q
                          ‘Aren’t (you) going to school?’
                     B:   ney.     (an         ka-yo.)
                          yes    not go-POL
                          ‘No. (I am not going.)’
                b.   A:   ne        ca-ni?
                          you       sleep-Q
                          ‘Are you sleeping?’                     B:   ani-(yjo.           (an         ca-yo.)
                          no-POL              not         sleep-POL
                          “No. (1 am not.)’
      For addressing, an extensive set of address terms are used, which include not only
personal names plus honorific titles but also professional titles and kinship terms.
These address terms are closely interrelated with different speech levels, as in Homin
a ‘Homin!’, papo ya ‘Idiot!’, yay ‘Child!’ [plain]; ipwa ‘Hello!’, Ayeng ‘Older
Brother!’, mwuna ya ‘Older Sister!’ [intimate]; yepokey ‘Hello!’, haksayng ‘Student!’,
Homin     i *Homin!’, Kim-kwun                 ‘Mr Kim!’, i salam a ‘Hey!’ (lit. ‘this person!’)
[familiar]; yepo/ipwa.yo ‘Hello!’, Kim-kwacang ‘Division Chief Kim!’, Dr Kim ‘Dr
Kim!’ [blunt]; Kim-paksa(-nim) ‘Dr Kim!’, Kim sensayng(-nim) ‘Mr Kim!’, Aal.apeci
‘grandfather [polite]; and sensayng-nim ‘Sir, Professor!’, Awacang-nim ‘Division
Chiefl’, hal.ape-nim ‘grandfather!’ [deferential] (see 9.14.1.2 for further discussion),
   There are many interjections such as acha ‘Heavens!, By Jove!, Shucks!’, emena
‘Good grief!’ (used only by females), pil-e mek-ul ‘Go to hell!’, ani ‘Oh My!, Why!,
Good     Heavens!’, a.yas ‘Ouch!’, celen ‘Good Heavens!’, and aiko/aikwu ‘Oh my!,
Dear me!, Good heavens!, Alas!, Gosh!’. For an extensive list, see H.M. Sohn 1994,
    The most frequently used interjection is aiko (or aikwu), as in aiko pay ya! ‘Oh!
My stomach aches!’, aiko cwuk-keyss-ta ‘Oh! I am really tired’ (lit. ‘I may die.’), aiko
sikan i ta toy-ss-ney ‘Oh my gosh! Time’s up’, and aiko kkamecak i-a ‘God, you
scared me!’
9.13            Reduction phenomenaVarious parts of sentences may be reduced to pro-forms or ZERO.                     The reduced
elements may be recoverable either from the discourse or situational context or from

the sentential context of which they are a part. Although different kinds of reduction
phenomena       are interrelated, let us, for convenience’s sake, use the term ellipsis to
refer to the omission              of a constituent        attributable         to the discourse             or situational
context, and terms like gapping, omission, pro-replacement, and reflexivization to
refer to reductions attributable to sentential contexts.","[410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417]"

      Like numerals, kinship and colour terms of the native stock are very limited (SK
words in these classes are predominant), Native kinship terms cover two generations
up and one generation down, as well as ego’s siblings, as in apeci ‘father’, emeni
‘mother’, Aalapeci ‘grandfather’, halmeni ‘grandmother’, acessi ‘uncle’, acwumeni
‘aunt’, oppa, olapeni ‘older brother’ (of a female), mwuna ‘older sister’ (of a male),

atul ‘son’, ttal ‘daughter’, cokha ‘nephew, niece’, sawi ‘son-in-law’, and myenuli
‘daughter-in-law’. Colour terms include the nouns kemceng ‘black’, nolang ‘yellow’,
phalang ‘blue, green’, pola ‘purple’, and ppalkang ‘red’; adjectives huyta, ha.yahta
‘be white’, kemta,         kkamahta       ‘be black’,   nolahta,    nwulehta    ‘be yellow’, phuluta,
phalahta ‘be blue, green’, and pulkta, ppalkahta                   ‘be red’; and extended adjective
forms    such as kemuteytey-hata, kemusulum-hata,                  kemucwukewuk-hata,      kemus-hata
96               The Korean language‘be darkish’, nwulusulum-hata              “be yellowish’, pulkusuley-hata           ‘be reddish’, say-
phalahta, si-phelehta ‘be deep blue’, and say-ppalkahta, si-ppelkehta ‘be dark red’.
    As will be observed in great detail in chapter 9 (9.14), the Korean native lexicon
has a rich variety          of native   hierarchical    honorific     expressions,       which    encompass
address-reference terms, personal pronouns, nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, case
particles, and suffixes. In addition, as will be discussed in chapters 8 and 9, Korean
has numerous particles that indicate case relations (e.g., nominative ka/i, accusative
(ul) or function as delimiters (e.g. (njun ‘as for’, to ‘also’, man ‘only’) and hundreds
of inflectional and derivational suffixes (e.g., interrogative ender -kka, conjunctive -ko
‘and’, and passive and causative suffixes). Almost all such particles and suffixes are
native. Also, so-called auxiliary predicates are all native. Having developed from
regular or ‘main’ predicates with change in meaning, auxiliary predicates occur after a
main predicate, as in mek-e pota ‘try eating’, where the verb mekta ‘eat’ is a main
verb, -e an infinitive suffix, and pota ‘try’ (derived from the main verb pota ‘see’) an
auxiliary verb. Furthermore, all demonstrative elements are native and display deictic-
anaphoric forms that are differentiated in four ways: i ‘this’ (close to speaker), ku
‘that’ (close to hearer; known to both speaker and hearer), ce ‘that over there’ (away
from speaker and hearer), and enu ‘which’.
   Finally, the Korean lexicon is characterized by the proliferation of sound symbolic
words in the native stratum. Since sound symbolism is particularly pervasive in
Korean, it is discussed in a separate section (5.3) below. For more on lexical classes,
see H.M. Sohn 1994.","[111, 112]"

                  ‘As for Milan, her eyes are big (in contrast with other body parts).’
   The    first unstressed          (nJun-marked          element    is interpreted         as the topic of the
sentence, whereas the second (n)un-marked element, whether stressed or not, indicates
contrast. Since the first unstressed (n)un-marked element usually denotes the topic of
the rest of the sentence, an embedded clause cannot have an unstressed (m)un-marked
subject, as in Mia ka/*nun tani-nu-n hak.kyo ka ceyil coh-ta ‘The school Mia attends
is the best.’
   The particle (nJun          is not used when                 the subject noun phrase          introduces new
indefinite information to the hearer, in which case the nominative particle i/ka is used.
Thus, in akka enu keci ka/*nun w-ass-e.yo; ku keci ka/nun pap ul tal-la ko hay-ss-
e.yo ‘A beggar came a while ago; he asked for food’, (njun cannot occur in the first
sentence which introduces new indefinite information (enu keci “certain beggar’), but
it can occur in the second              sentence because             by then the information             is already
registered in the hearer’s knowledge and is thus represented as a definite noun.
  Constituent delimiters such as (i)ya ‘only if, as only for, indeed’, (i)na ‘or the like,
348              The Korean languageor something; approximately, as many/much as’ (i.e., emeni na manna-n tus-i kipp-

of anything better’ (e.g., pay kKophu-myen i kes i-lato mek-ela ‘If you are hungry, why
don’t you eat even this’), (i/nama ‘lacking anything better, inconvenient though it is’
(e.g., may-wel cokum inama cechwuk.ha-ko siph-ta ‘1 wish to save at least a little
amount every month’), (i)yamallo ‘indeed, precisely, none other than’ (e.g.,
Kumkang-san iyamallo cengmal alumtaw-e.yo ‘The Diamond Mountains are indeed
beautiful’), appear to have developed from the copula i + a conjunctive suffix. As
grammaticalized forms, they have various syntactic restrictions. For instance, (i)ya
occurs only in declarative sentences, as in ne ya ka-keyss-ci ‘I assume that you must

      The constituent delimiters kkaci ‘even, as far as, up to’, cocha ‘even, as well’, and
mace ‘even, so far as, as a last alternative’ are semantically so closely related to each
other that they are more or less mutually interchangeable with only minute differences
in meaning.","[363, 364]"

9.2.4.3         Locational adjectives
There are adjectives that require, in addition to a subject, an overt or covert nominal in
the locative case marked by the particles eykey/hanthey/kkey ‘at, to (an animate)’ or ey
‘at, to (an inanimate)’. One subset comprises the adjectives which denote not only
existence and location but also possession, ¢.g. issta “be, stay, have’, kyeysita ‘be,
stay’ (honorific), epsta ‘be not, not stay, do not have’, manhta ‘be much, many, have a
lot’, and cekta ‘be little, few, do not have a lot’.
(33)            a.     halapeci       kkey       chayk    i                 manh-a.yo.
                       grandpa        at         book     NM         ~~     many-POL
                       (lit. ‘There are many books with my grandpa.’)
                b.     na eykey          coh-un      sayngkak                    i          iss-e.
                       I     at          good-RL idea                            NM _       exist-INT
                     (lit. ‘There is a good idea with me.’)
      When possession is intended, the locative nominal denoting an animate is shifted
to the nominative case functioning as the subject of the sentence. Then, the original
nominative subject (chayk, sayngkak in (33)) functions as the object, although its
nominative particle remains intact.

8.1.7            DeterminersDeterminers may also be termed pre-nouns or unconjugated adjectives, in that they do
not inflect and they modify nouns in a pre-noun position. This small class may be
subclassified as in (6). Although qualifiers and quantifiers have less determinative
property than demonstratives, they are grouped together in view of their similar
syntactic behaviour.
(6)              a.   Demonstrative: definite, indefinite
                 b.   Qualifier
                 c.   Quantifier
       Demonstratives show a four-way distinction: definite / ‘this’, ku ‘that (close to
hearer or known to both speaker and hearer)’, and ce ‘that over there’, and indefinite
enu ‘which, any, a certain’, as in i salam ‘this person’, ku chayk ‘that book (near you);
the book (we are talking about)’, ce cha ‘that car over there’, and enu nal ‘which day,
one certain day’. Demonstratives are used very frequently and go into a wide variety
of compounds. They are also used as demonstrative pronouns, as mentioned in 8.1.3.
   Qualifiers are those pre-noun words which qualitatively modify the head noun, as
                8 Word structure                                                         211
in say ‘new’ in say cha ‘a new car’. Other examples are hen ‘used’, hyen ‘current’,
musun     ‘what kind of, some kind of, fa/un ‘another’, o/un ‘right-hand side of, oyn
‘left-hand side of, pyel-pyel ‘all kinds of’, tfan ‘different’, weyn ‘what manner/sort of,
some manner/sort of’, yenu ‘ordinary’, etten ‘what kind of, some kind of, yeys ‘old’,
and yo-kkacis ‘this much of’.
   Quantifiers modify the head noun quantitatively, as in may ‘every’ in may hakki
‘every semester’. Other examples are cen ‘whole’, ches ‘first’, cho ‘beginning’, kak
‘each’, kun     ‘approximately’, motun     ‘all, every’, myech   ‘how   many,    several’, on
‘entire, full’, yak ‘approximately’, yele ‘many’, and yenam.un           ‘some    ten odd, a
dozen’. All numerals that occur before a numeral counter behave as quantifiers, as in
han kwen ‘one (book, notebook)’. Thus, numerals are (quantifier) determiners when
used as part of a numeral compound.","[226, 227]"

this time. Thus, present-day coh ‘good’ and ce ‘that’ were tjoh and tje, respectively.
Similarly, word-initial deletion of m before i and j did not occur at this time, as shown
in nima ‘forehead’ (present ima), and nimkim ‘king’ (present imkim).
   In addition to the phonological aspects discussed thus far, the Hankul literature of
the fifteenth century was the first and oldest data to show the comprehensive
grammatical system of Korean. Some of the salient morphological and syntactic
properties of this period are presented in the following.
   The case system included the following case particles. Notice that the forms of
genitive,   locative, accusative,    and    instrumental—directional       particles began      with    a
Yang or Yin vowel (marked by a slash). Occurrence of these forms was conditioned
by the final vowel of the preceding words in terms of vowel harmony. Contemporary
Korean forms are also given for comparison. C stands for a consonant and V a vowel.","[64, 65]"

9,2.1          Declarative, interrogative, propositive, and imperative
A simplex sentence or the main clause of a complex sentence belongs to one of four
basic   sentence    types:     declarative    (making   a statement),      interrogative   (asking    a
question), propositive (making a proposal), and imperative (making                      a command).
These four sentence types are marked by sentence enders each of which consists of
one or more inflectional suffixes (8.4.3). Superimposed on the four sentence types are
six speech   levels, plain, intimate, familiar, blunt, polite, and deferential, plus the
neutral level which will be discussed shortly. Observe the four different sentence
types as they are inflected in the seven levels in (7).(7)            a.   Declarative

   The plain speech level, which is the lowest level, is used, in general, by any
speaker to any child, to one’s own younger sibling, child, or grandchild regardless of
age, and to one’s daughter-in-law,                  and also between       intimate adult friends whose
friendship began in childhood. The intimate level, also called the half-talk style, is
used by a child of pre-school age to his or her family members including parents, and
between close friends whose friendship began in childhood or adolescence. It may
also be used to one’s adult or adolescent student, or to one’s son-in-law. This level is
frequently intermixed with the plain level or the familiar level in the same discourse
with the same person. The familiar level is slightly more formal than the intimate
level, typically used by a male adult to an adolescent such as a high school or college
student or to one’s son-in-law, or between two close adult friends whose friendship
began in adolescence. The remaining three levels are used only to adult addressees.
The blunt level, which is gradually disappearing from daily usage probably due to its
authoritative connotation, is sometimes used by a boss to his subordinates or by an old
generation husband to his wife.
      The most popularly used level is the polite one, which is the informal counterpart
of the deferential level. In daily conversations with distant equals or superiors, male
speakers usually intermix the deferential and polite levels in the same discourse, while
female speakers tend to use only the polite level. Between close adults, however, the
polite level alone is usually used by both sexes. In verbal news reports and formal
announcements, the deferential level is exclusively used by both sexes.
      While the enders of all six speech levels are used in conversation, neutral-level
enders are used only in an embedded clause of a quotative construction, in writing to a
general    audience     as   in          books,   articles,   and   newspapers,    and    in   written   exam
instructions. The neutral-level forms are the same as the plain-level forms except in
interrogatives and imperatives. In interrogatives, the neutral-level ender is only (-nu)-
nya, and not -ni; and in imperatives, the ender is -(uj/a, and not -(e/a)/a.

i-kka (interrogative), and -(si-op)-sose (imperative), and appears only in religious
prayers, poems, and in extremely formal and deferential letters. In both this and the
blunt levels, no inherent propositive form is available. It seems that, in the former, the
addressee is so vastly superior that the speaker could not propose to share an action,
whereas, in the latter, the deferential propositive form -p-si-ta (without the subject
honorific suffix -(u)si) fills the slot pragmatically, as illustrated by yeki tto o-p-si-ta
‘Let’s come here again’ in (7c).
    Declarative sentences include not only descriptive, assertive, or reporting
sentences, but also so-called apperceptive sentences such as (9a, b), suppositive
sentences such as (9c), promissive-assurance sentences such as (9d), admonitive
(warning) sentences such as (9e), elliptical sentences such as (9f, g), and rhetorical
sentences such as (9h).

274                  The Korean language       Propositive         and     imperative        sentences   are largely       equivalent   to English    /er’s
constructions             and     imperative        sentences,   respectively,      although    there   are   some
interesting syntactic and semantic differences. Unlike in English, most adjectives in
Korean cannot be made                     into propositive and imperative constructions (see 9.2.2),
Thus, English sentences like ‘Let’s be quiet’ or ‘Be quict!’ cannot be expressed with
the adjective co.yonghata                   ‘be quiet’, unless       it is changed       to a verb phrase      like
co.yong-hi hata (lit. “do quietly’), as in co.yong-hi ha-ca ‘Let’s be quiet’ and co. yong-
hi hay-la! ‘Be quiet!’ Propositive sentences may be used not only for suggesting both
the speaker and the hearer’s joint action but also the speaker’s or the hearer’s action
alone.
(11)                 a.     nay      ka           ka-ca.
                            I        NM     _—    go-PR
                            ‘[ propose that I go.’
                     b.     co.yong-hi           — ha-p-si-ta.
                            quiet-AD               do-AH-RQ-PR
                            “You guys, be quiet!’      Notice in (lla) that the suffix -ca may relinquish the participation of the hearer
while retaining the proposal meaning. Similarly, when one wants to get off a crowded
bus, he or she usually says nayli-p-si-ta (get off-AH-RQ-PR) “Let me get off!” (lit.
‘Let’s get off.’).
      The   forces of command                    in imperative sentences may          be of different degrees,
including      order,           demand,     permission,       request,   advice,     warning,   plea,   and   even
welcome, as illustrated in (12) with the plain sentence ender.

9.2.2          Verbs and adjectives
Korean has two classes of predicates: verbs (denoting activity and process) and
adjectives (denoting stativity). Korean adjectives do not appear after a copula (which
is an adjective in its own right), but instead inflect for honorifics, tense-aspect, and
modality, just as verbs do. Thus, for instance, there is no syntactic difference between
the verb cwuk-ess-ta (die-PST-DC) ‘died’ and the adjective sulph-ess-ta (be sad-PST-
DC) ‘was sad’,
   The main difference               between        verbs      and adjectives         is morphological,           in that
different inflectional allomorphs are attached to them (8.1.5; 8.1.6; 8.4). Thus, the
plain-level indicative form is -(nujn for verbs, as in ilk-nun-ta ‘reads’ and ka-n-ta
‘goes’,    and ZERO             for adjectives,         as in sulphu-ta         ‘is sad’         and khu-ta      ‘is big’.
Adnominal indicative forms are also different: -nu in verbs and ZERO in adjectives as
in ilk-nu-n ‘reading’, ka-nu-n ‘going’ vs. sulphu-n, khu-n ‘big’. The lack of
past/perfect adnominal forms in adjectives is another difference. Thus, there are no
past/perfect adjective forms comparable to verb constructions such as ilk-un salam ‘a
person who read’ and ca-n salam ‘a person who slept’.
   There     are        syntactic    differences        too.    First,     adjectives      are     limited     mostly     to
declarative and interrogative sentences, whereas                             verbs occur in propositive and
imperative sentences as well. Adjective constructions in propositive or imperative
sound     unnatural.        There    are many           exceptions,        however,     as shown             in adjective
constructions such as kenkangha-p-si-ta (healthy-AH-RQ-PR) ‘Let’s be healthy!’,
hayngpokha-sey-yo! (happy-SH-POL) ‘Be happy!’, solcikha-ca! ‘Let’s be frank’, and
pucilenhay-la! (diligent-IM) ‘Be diligent!’
   Second, only verbs are. allowed to be made progressive with the progressive-
forming construction -ko iss-ta (and exist-DC) ‘be ~ing’, as in (13).
(13)               a.     nay        ka        _al-ko            iss-ta.                           (verb)
                          |        NM _ know-and_ exist-DC
                          ‘I am aware of it.’ (Lit. ‘I am knowing it.’)
276               The Korean language                 b.   *Nami       ka          kenkangha-ko              iss-ta.           (adjective)
                       Nami       NM_healthy-and                        stay-DC
                      “Nami is being healthy.’   Third, only verbs occur with ‘intentive’ and ‘purposive’ conjunctive suffixes such
as -(u)lyeko ‘intending to’ and the conjunctive phrase -ki wiha-ye (NOM do for-and)
‘in order to, with a view to’. Notice that adjectives are not permitted in (14).
(14)             a.   Inho ka              al-lyeko     —_ ayssu-n-ta.
                      Inho NM_know-to            try hard-IN-DC
                      ‘Inho tries hard to find out.’                 a .*inho        ka         kippu-lyeke      — ayssu-n-ta.
                       Inho NM_shappy-to             try hard-IN-DC
                      ‘Inho tries hard to be happy.’                 b.   tongmul          un        mek-ki            wiha-ye        — sa-n-ta.
                      animal           TC             eat-NOM ~    do for-to        live-IN-DC
                      “Animals live to eat.’
                 b'.*inkan            un        kippu-ki           wiha-ye          —_sa-n-ta.

                      ‘People live to be happy.’
       Fourth, while the sentence-ender -(a/e)/a is imperative with a verb as in (15a), it is
exclamatory with an adjective, as in (15b).
(15)             a.   mek-ela.                            (verb)
                      eat-IM
                      ‘Please eat.’
                 b.   chwuw-ela.                          (adjective)
                      cold-EX
                      ‘Iam cold!’
      Fifth, the object (or patient) of a transitive verb takes the accusative particle (J)ul as
in (16a) whereas the object (or patient) of a ‘transitive adjective’ takes the nominative
particle ka/i as in (16b).

                    ‘Nami envied Mia.’   There are other more specific syntactic differences, which will be touched on here
and there in the subsections that follow. A few words function as both verbs and
adjectives with corresponding meaning differences: ha- “do (verb); be in the state of

be big, tall (adjective)’, muc- ‘get late (verb); be late (adjective)’, kamsahata ‘thank

other’, and sangho (mutual-together) ‘mutual(ity)’. The SK tangsin and caki are used
as both second-person           pronouns     and reflexive pronouns.       In particular, caki as a
second person is a recent innovation used to one’s spouse or girl- or boyfriend. Thus,
caki-tul as a second person usually refers to ‘you (spouse, girl- or boyfriend) and your
friends’. Reciprocal pronouns are also used as adverbs.
      Interrogative-indefinite pronouns         such as nmwukwu     (nwu    before the nominative
particle ka)      ‘who,   someone’,    amu     ‘anyone’,   mues   ‘what,   something’,   efi ‘where,
somewhere’,       encey     ‘when,   some    time’, e/ma   ‘how   much,    some   amount’,    and the
compounds enu-ay/salam/pun ‘who, someone’ are all native words. Demonstratives
are used as pronouns in phrases like 7 Awu ‘after this’, ku ilay ‘since that (time)’, and
ce kath-i ‘like that’. The compounds yeki (< i ‘this’ + eki ‘place’) ‘here’, keki (< ku
‘that (near you)’ + eki) ‘there (near you)’, and ceki (< ce ‘that over there’ + eki) ‘over
there’ are locational demonstrative pronouns.","[223, 224]"

      The Sinla language also had case and delimiter particles such as nominative i,
genitive    ij/oj, s, accusative    /, Aol,   instrument   rz,   delimiter n (topic-contrast),
delimiter t2 ‘also’, etc. (K.M. Lee ibid.:14; I.S. Lee, et al. ibid:291). In addition, most
inflectional suffixes that are currently in use were already developed then. Thus, the
past relativizer was -n as in ka-n pom ‘the spring that passed’, the prospective suffix
44              The Korean languagewas -/ as in k2/i-] mozom ‘the mind that will long for’, conjunctive suffixes were -ko
‘and’, -myo ‘and’, -taka ‘and then’, etc., and the interrogative ender was -ko. Even the
honorific system of the Sinla language corresponds largely to that of Contemporary
Korean. The subject honorific suffix was -si and the object honorific suffix was -solp
from which the current addressee honorific suffix -(sujp developed. The lexicon was
also generally in agreement with that of Middle Korean.
    The period of Old Korean was the initial stage of the influx of Chinese character
words. In the sixth century, the titles of the kings were changed from pure Korean to
Sino-Korean terms, with the use of the term way ‘king’. In the middle of the eighth
century, i.e., during the Unified Sinla period, native place names were altered and
modelled after the Chinese tradition, so that they consisted of two Chinese characters
as they do now.","[59, 60]"

cungke ‘the evidence (that)’, kKanungseng ‘the possibility (that)’, and many others that

                    ‘Why don’t you ask when Kiho is leaving?’
   As illustrated in (83b), Korean has a set of head nominals (e.g., hyep.pak ‘threat’)
that require quoting a statement.          In such constructions, a quotative construction
appears in the relative clause frequently with the deletion of the quotative particle ko
and the saying verb hata ‘say’. Head nouns of this type are numerous, which include
somun ‘rumour’, yaksok ‘promise’, sosik ‘news’, cwucang ‘claim’, ilon ‘theory’, poko
‘report’, cengpo ‘information’, myenglyeng ‘order’, kopayk ‘confession’, sayngkak
‘idea, thought’, uykyen ‘opinion’, chwuchik ‘speculation’, and nukkim ‘feeling’.
    Relative clauses with the defective noun kes ‘thing, fact, assumed fact’ as the head
often behave as if they do not have a head from a semantic point of view. Such
constructions are often termed ‘headless’. Examples follow.(85)          a.    Minho     nun [thayngkhu ka ka-nuj-n kes ul                     _po-ass-e.
                    Minho     TC   tank      NM go-IN-RL fact AC                      see-PST-INT
                    “Minho saw a tank going.’
              b.    ne-n    [totwuki         unhayng eyse nao-nu)j-n kes ul            cap-ass-ni?

                   ‘Did you catch the thief when he came out of the bank?’
              b'.ne-n       [(PROi)     unhayng eyse nao-nuj-n totwuk ul cap-ass-ni?
                    you-TC thief NM bank       from exit-IN-RL thief            AC catch-PST-Q
                    *Did you catch the thief coming out of the bank?’Note in (85a), for instance, that syntactically kes is the head nominal of the relative
clause and is coreferential with the whole relative clause meaning the tank’s going.
However, kes has nearly empty semantic content. Also, in (85b), kes does not refer to
the whole preceding clause, i.e., the thief’s coming out of the bank. Since the thief is
the one who was caught, one might equate kes in this sentence with totwuk in the
relative clause, suggesting that the nominal head is incorporated in the relative clause.
In this interpretation, (85b) must be a variant of (85b') which is a relative clause
proper. However, the intended meaning is that the police caught the thief when he
314                The Korean languagecame out of the bank, unlike (85b’' ). This intriguing issue requires further study.
       The last relative clause type includes constructions where the relativized coreferent
is opaque. As observed in (86), the relativized PRO cannot be easily identified within
the relative clause.
(86)               nanun         kapcaki       [koki kwup-nuj-n       naymsay        lul     math-ass-ta.

                   ‘I suddenly smelled the smell of (somebody) broiling meat.’
       Similar examples are [kicha ka ka-nu]-n soli ‘the sound of a train running’ and [ay
ka wu-nu}-n soli ‘the sound of a baby crying’. In general, these are constructions with
a head noun denoting one of the five senses or a trace (e.g., huncek, palcachwi,
cakwuk). The head noun can be postulated in the relative clause not as a constituent
PRO       but   a conjunctive         clause      something    like naymsay-lul phiwu-myense                   ‘while
making a smell’ or soli-lul nay-myense ‘while making noise’.
       A few additional remarks on Korean relativization are in order. In Korean, there is
no distinction between a simple adjective expression (e.g., a happy boy) and a relative
expression (€.g.,            a boy who is happy), nor between a participial construction (e.g., a
running boy) and its relative counterpart (e.g., a boy who is running). Expressions like
hayngpok.ha-n ai ‘a happy child, a child who is happy’ and talli-nun ai ‘a running
child, a child who is running’ are all that there are. This is due to the word-order
principle       that all modifiers         must     precede    their heads.    Furthermore,          as we      have
observed        above,       there   is not    much     difference    in syntactic         behaviour      between
adjectives and verbs with regard to relative clause formation.
      Both ‘restrictive’ (87a) and ‘non-restrictive’ (87b) relative clauses occur, but there
is no overt linguistic marking distinguishing them.
(87)               a.    Yongho       ka       manna-n        yeca     nun     Kim         Nami        y-a.

                         ‘The girl Yongho met is Kim Nami.’

                         ‘Kim Nami, whom I met, is my friend’s younger sister.’
9.4.4              Complement clause constructions
A complement clause modifies or complements the verb or adjective of the matrix
clause in which it is embedded, in terms of aspect, purpose, intent, obligation, wish,
                   9 Grammatical structure                                                              315
etc.     A complement clause and its cooccurring main clause predicate are semantically
cohesive to varying degrees.            In some cases, they are so fossilized that they are
considered single lexical items, as in i/enata ‘get up’ (< il-e nata (rise-INF come out))
and phamutta ‘bury’ (< pha-a mutta (dig-INF bury)).
   There is a set of suffixes (i.e., complementizers) that relate a complement clause to
the main predicate. Many of them are also used as conjunctive suffixes, as indicated in
9.4.1. Unlike in conjunctive constructions, however, complementizers occur only with
a      limited   number       of main       clause   predicates.    Compare      (88a),   a conjunctive
construction, with (88b), a complement construction.
(88)               a.   na nun      kyohoy      ey   ka-lyeko          ilccik    ilena-ss-e.
                        I    TC     church      to   go-intending      early     get up-PST-INT
                        ‘Intending to go to church, I got up early.’
                   b.   na nun      kyohoy      ey   ilccik        ka-lye(ko)       hay-ss-e.
                        1 TC       church to     early      go-intending            do-PST-INT
                        ‘I intended to go to church early.’
       Notice in (88a) that the two clauses kyohoy ey ka-lyeko and ilccik ilena-ss-e are
conjoined        conjunctively,     being     more    or   less    independent    of each       other   both
syntactically and semantically. In this use, -/yeko cannot be contracted to -/ye. In
(88b), on the other hand, kyohoy ey ilccik ka-lye(ko) does not contain any conjunctive
sense but complements the verb hata, which does not indicate the usual meaning ‘do’
but, together with the suffix -/ye(ko), means                 ‘intend to’. In this use, -/yeko can be
contracted to -/ye.
    Frequently used complementizers are given below, along with typical main clause
predicates (mostly auxiliary verbs) that immediately follow these complementizers in
a sentence. The most productively used complementizer is the infinitive suffix -e/-a
with which a wide variety of main clause predicates cooccur. In the following, the
predicate examples are given with the original meanings in parentheses from which
their ‘auxiliary’ meanings are derived. Some grammatical terms used in Martin, et al.
1967 and elsewhere are given in square brackets.

complement clause predicate and that of the main clause predicate are serialized or
compounded, the former usually modifying the latter in terms of manner, as in ki-e
kata (crawl-INF go) ‘crawl away’, kkwulh-e ancta (bend knees-INF sit) ‘kneel down’,
kapang ul tul-ko kata (bag AC hold-and go) ‘go holding a bag’, cwul ul cap-a tangkita
(rope AC hold-INF pull) ‘pull the rope’, koki /ul kwuw-e mekta (meat AC broil-INF
eat) ‘broil and eat the meat’, and fol ul tul-e ollita (rock AC hold-INF lift) ‘hold the
rocks up’. In serial constructions,     as noticed in these examples,        the main clause
predicates generally retain their independent lexical meanings. Main clause predicates
can be used independently without a complement clause, as in hakkyo ey kata ‘go to
school’ and fol ul ollita ‘lift the rocks’. While serial predicates can be treated as a
318            The Korean languagesubset   of complement     constructions   (S.H.   You    1996),   they   are also viewed   as
compound verbs of the V + V type (e.g., T. Chung 1993; J. Kim 1993), Under the
latter view, only auxiliary constructions are of the complement clause type.
    In auxiliary constructions, main clause predicates are popularly called ‘auxiliary’
predicates in that they cannot occur without a complement clause and their meaning is
auxiliary to the complement clause predicate. They have been derived from
corresponding regular verbs in the course of time with change in meaning as shown in
(89). For instance, the inchoative auxiliary verb cita ‘get to be’ (e.g., nac i kil-e ci-n-ta
‘Daytime is getting longer’) is derived from the verb cita ‘fall’ (e.g., hay ka ci-n-ta
‘The sun is setting’), the completive auxiliary verb pelita ‘finish up’ (e.g., ton ul ta ss-
e pely-ess-ta ‘(He) used up all his money’) is derived from the verb pelita ‘throw
away’ (e.g., ssuleyki lul pely-ess-ta ‘(He) threw away the rubbish’), and the
experiential auxiliary verb pota ‘try’ (e.g., cenhwahay po-sey-yo ‘Try calling’) is
derived from the verb pota ‘see, look’ (e.g., yeki lul po-sey-yo ‘Look here’). Together
with the complementizers (e.g., -e/-a, -ko) they manifest various aspectual and
modality meanings,
   Notice that Aata ‘cause, think, show signs of, be in the state of is widely used as a
main clause predicate. In this function, hata does not retain its inherent meanings such
as ‘do’ and ‘make’ but is compounded with the preceding predicate to derive another
meaning, as in silh-e hata (hateful-INF do) ‘dislike’, ka-ya hata (go-only if do) ‘must
go’, o-lyeni hata (come-assuming do) ‘assume that (he) will come’, nol-key hata
(play-AD do) ‘permit (him) to have fun’, ka-koca hata (go-intending do) ‘want to go’,
ka-ko nun hata (go-and TC do) ‘go habitually’, ka-lyeko hata (go-intending do)
‘intend to go’, ka-mcik hata (go-likely do) ‘be likely to go’, Awulm-tasiphi hata
(starve-nearly do) ‘almost starve’, and ka-ss-umyen hata (go-PST-if do) ‘wish to go’.
    One property shared by many complement clause constructions is that no
past/perfect suffix can be attached to the predicate preceding the complementizer. The
event time of the complement clause is either the same as or after the time denoted by
the predicate of the main clause.

exceptions, taking a past/perfect suffix, as in ka-ss-e.ya hay-ss-ta ‘(He) should have
gone’ and ka-ss-umyen hay-ss-ta ‘(He) wished to go.’
       Another characteristic of complement clauses is that they can be followed by the
accusative particle (/)ul, as well as by delimiters, even if the following main predicate
is intransitive. In this case, the accusative particle may be viewed as an emphatic
delimiter.
