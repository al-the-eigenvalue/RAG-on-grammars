5.3 The cases
   Una i s a language in which the semantic relationships between participants, locations
and obj ects within a clause are marked, where relevant, by means of case markers,
                                                                                             107affixed to a personal pronoun or postposed to a particular noun or noun phrase. The Una
case system is typically ergative - m arking the agent - of a transitive finite verb. A
complete listing of these case markers, and some appropriate glosses, are given below:

5.3.2 Ergative case
   The subject of a transitive finite verb is marked by the ergative case and occurs in
three distinct forms:
(a)      beji                             -nyi
             'E RG' when it follows a proper noun, inalienably-posse ssed kin term, or
         nominalized word inflected with the suffix  'person masculine'.

5.3.3 Dative case
   Two dative case markers are optionally used in Una to indicate the noun, noun phrase,
or personal pronoun which marks the indirect object of the verb (i.e., the person to whom
the action mentioned i the verb is designated.) Specific features in the higher levels of the
hierarchy, like the discourse, sometimes cause zero dative case marking. The two
distinct forms are:
( a)     biysiy                               -nyi
               'DAT' is used when it follows a proper noun, inalienably-possessed kin term,
         or nominalized word inflected with the suffix      'person masculine'.
e . g.   1. ni iiii weyk kuboka Musa biysiy .eb-ma-se
              I   fear great being      Musa DAT        talk-incompAsp-3pst 1 sg

              'He returned the boy heal�d to his father'
         The following sentence has zero dative case marking:
         5.   sun-ci ak -ay dam-nyi 0 uram eb-ma-y
              they-ERG that-hut place-person DAT talk              speak-incompAsp-3pst t-3pl
              'They spoke to the landlord'
         -siy
         niy-siy
(b)            'DAT' is used when it follows a personal pronoun.
         kan-siy         to me                   nun-siy
                                                 sun-siyy       to us         er-siy          to you(sg)

Vowel reduplication occurs in: [[nisiy]]          -> niysiy
e . g.   1.   er-ci niy-siy        ato  eb-ma-n-ow

   The locative case marker  aji (kuboka)
                                        indicates both the exterior or adessive markers
'atJon', and the interior or inessive markers 'in/within'. The locative case marker                                      ay dam, umbura, ay umbura
always follows the noun or noun phrase which indicates an open location unless the

5.3.8 Referential case
   The suffix      -ti
                which has two distinct, alth ough related, fun ctions is suffixed to a
personal pronoun.
(a)      The first function is that of marking the benefactee to which the sentence fin al
         primary verb refers. The person to which the benefactory suffix of the verb refers         suffixed. In this function      -ti
         should be the same as the one of the pronoun to which the referential case marker is
                                       means 'for'.

         proper sense of the word) to a person or thing. In that function              means         personal pronoun to which       -ti
         'concerning/aboutiregarding', and in this case the category of person denoted by the
                                        is suffixed is never marked in the verb.

8.5.5.1.2 Thematic/logical cohesion
   Thematic cohesion within Una expository discourse is mainly a reference by the
content of the first clause, or sentence of a paragraph, which relates to, and is maintained
by, the overall topic of the discourse and also to that what follows from thereon in the
paragraph. The thematic cohesion forms a basic condition-result-reason notional
relation within and between succeeding paragraphs. This basic notional structure is
usually in the above mentioned order, but not necessarily so.
   In the sample text five different paragraph types have been noticed:   3.42..
   1.
                                       9, 12, 13,2,15;3,17,4,5,19; 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 18;
            Condition-result-reason: paragraphs
            Condition-result: paragraphs
                                     8. 16;
            Condition-reason-result: paragraph   5.       Condition-reason: paragraph
            Result-reason : paragraph
                                 (1)       8
    However, the condition of paragraph is expressed in the previous paragraphs of the
text. Therefore we can say:
                                                                                           (2)
                                  a conditional constituent is an obligatory notional feature
expressed in the text of a paragraph or in a previous paragraph;               a conditional
con stituent obligatorily precedes eith er/or reason-result or vice versa. The basicinfinitum.
condition-re sult-reason structure in a discourse may be expanded seemingly                           ad
indicates a reason for a certain event. Note for example, in sentence      159, a deyok aji
                In a few cases the notional relation is encoded in an initial clause which
                                                                                          'for

that reason'. A specific class of verb inflection marks the hypothetical or reason- result
'if . . . then' conjunctions (cf.            The following sample taken from another
discourse shows this:

8.5.5.2 Participant orientation
   Participant orientation in Una usually does not cause any problems due to the fact that
the agent obligatorily is encoded not only in the verb, but also optionally, but frequently,
in the form of a personal pronoun, proper noun or descriptive noun or noun phrase (cf.
Figure 43). Unlike other languages Una, with its very precise agent reference system in
the verb, does not give too many opportunities for ambiguities with respect to who is doing
what to whom. The information is usually clearly encoded.
   In this expository discourse we notice individual and unitary reference. There isbaramnyi nang
group reference, either to individual centred groups (as in sentence 38              sun Okbab
                  'the people who walked to Okbab'), or to collective groups in which no
individual stands out: (e.g. , sentences 32-36: 'they . . . all people'). Some groups are
partitionable into smaller groups; (e.g. sentences 38 and 1 63 : 'the Kerabuk people who
went to Okbab . . . they' and sentence 41 : 'Nginngin, Dinab and Etum . . . they all').
  Reference to conventi onal groups occurs often in this di scourse so that 'they'
automatically refers to the entire society of Langda of which the narrator is a part, and
where most events occurred.
   A certain amount of referential shifting goes on; groups expand and contract. There
is also change in the scale with which the narrator views the otherslhimself withoutpart of a groups of young children:
                           (
                                        nuram
                                           ... wekum . . nun weyk
                                  - talk not                 we kum ... nun mitik mabwa
changing membership ; e.g. in sentences 1 26-131 in which he refers to himself as being a... ni weyk kibmasibok my                          big not . . .    small children . . . while-I­
grew-up) ' 1 did not say that . . . we were not big . . . we were small children . . . while I grew
up .. .'. As seen above, the narrator sometimes focuses on himself, sometimes on the
group, without apparent reason.
   Sometimes zero (0) identification occurs in certain environments, usually in rapid
speech near the discourse peaks which show a high degree of excitement. However, in
those cases the identity of the participants which are in focus is completely clear to the
audience (cf. sentences 66, 1 01 , 1 50, 1 51 and 1 69).","[165, 166]"

the set are used as personal and possessive pronouns. Besides the semantic difference the
only grammatical di stinction reflecting the different functions is that personal pronouns
are always free forms, while possessive pronouns are always bound forms prefixed to
nouns.

3.2.2 Pronouns used as possessive pronouns
    The pronouns which are used as possessive pronouns are prefIxed to nouns (cf. Figure
1 9) and characterize semantically the information that there exists a certain relationship
between a person and that object which is designated by the noun to which it is prefIxed.
     The following kinds of relationships in Una can be distinguished:
1.     A thing designated which belongs to, or is an inalienable possession of the person
       i ndicate d :
                                    Mar I Pro          Nuc I NRt

3.2.3 Demonstrative pronouns/locational deictics
   Figures 20 and 21 contain a group of locational deictics which are found in Una. They
refer to the location of the object in question. Their directions are not tied to any point of
the compass, but to levels in relation to an object on the horizon and the location of the
speaker (Louwerse 1 985a).
   The spectrum of relative distance in Una from very close to distant is different from
English, and has a varying threshold depending on the contexts in which it is used;
specifically, whether a person (including self), things, or both are involved.
   Overriding this, the relative size of the things being observed, or reflected on, and the
context in which they are observed determine the specific term used (e.g. some celestial
bodies might be called very close even though they are light-years apart). By means of a
tone distinction in the locational deictics two degrees of relative nearness or remoteness
can be indicated.

device frequently used in Una discourse, especially in narrative discourse. In this

preceding sentence is repeated in the onset of the next sentence in an Adverbial Clause.
The Adverbial Clause has the function of maintaining discourse perspective between
successive parts of the sentence and paragraphs relative to the discourse as a whole. The
tail-head linkage can also give a summary of previous actions, or it can imply a script­to be exact. See for example sentences      10  and 11 yanmarey

             'they two p assed by and went', in which the latter is a continuation of the
movement from the viewpoint of the narrator. In Una oral and written presentation of
discourse (especially in narrative discourse) tail-head linkage is automatic, so that
every successive sentence which moves the event-line forward in a narrative paragraph
will have such a tail-head linkage. H owever, it seems typical for at least some Papua

Surface structure markers on the right-hand side of the spectrum line of Figure 47 are the
most dynamic; those at the lower left-hand side are the most static. The main-line is
carried by primary preterite predications, which are either sentence final, medial, or

of the agent, and optionally the person and number of the object.","[168, 169, 170]"

   This study is based upon a M.A. Linguistics thesis written by the author at The
University of Texas at Arlington. This revision and update represents a continuing
investigation of the Una language. As such it is still only the beginning of fully
explicating the intricacies of this non-Austronesian language of the Central New Guinea
Macro Phylum.
   In many ways this linguistic analysis forms only a part of a continuing research of
the Una people, their worldview and culture (Louwerse 1987c, 1988b). We began our study
of the Una language and culture after arrival in the village of Langda on June 22, 1973
and establishment of friendly contacts with this not-previously-contacted mountain tribe,
and have continued field work to September 1984 with a total of 99 months actually spent
in the language area.
   Several different sources of data have been used. Probably the most important source
is fl uency gained by constant use of the C entral Ey river valley Una dialect and
familiarity with the three other Una dialects during most of my eleven years of residence
in the area. The narrower base for the study is a collection of transcribed recorded texts,
including folk tales, myths, expositions of local cultural activities and n arratives of
events both recent and long ago. In general, every major point in the description rests on
data included in the filed corpus.
   I wish first of all to express my appreciation for the patience and generosity of the
approximately 3500 Una people who have taught my wife and me the Una language and
culture. Thereby they broadened our horizons significantly. A few of those deserve
special m ention . I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Niykowdeymus Balyo,
Siylas Malyo and Karba Nabyal , all approximately 16 to 30 years of age and
monolingual in the beginning of our research. The literacy program (Louwerse 1978f)
which was started in the vernacular in 1975 resulted in different degrees of literalness of
these language teachers. They, together with the other 150 men, women and children of
the village of Langda, and the other residents of the Una language regions have played a
very large part in helping us to learn their language. From the beginning they have been
involved in translation projects of educational literature and the Una Bible (Louwerse
1979, 1980a-c, 1983b, 1984a, b, 1986d, h, 1987a, 1988a) and ethnomusicology (Louwerse
1985i, j). Without them this research could not have been done.
    All research has been conducted under the auspices of the Mission of the Netherlands
Reformed Congregations (NRS) to whom I am grateful for a grant for study and
re search.
   I wish to express my gratitude to my supervising committee, at The University of
Texas at Arlington Drs R.E. Longacre, D . Burquest, and E.W. D eibler Jr, for their
personal interest, patience and enthusiasm in trying to teach me the principles of
                                            v
vilinguistic research a n d writing with accuracy and clarity. The helpful discussions
concerning many aspects of the grammar with Summer Institute of Linguistics Drs G.L.
Huttar, M. Ray and Professor M. Mayers, are due special appreciation. Their influence
will undoubtedly be reflected in any worthwhile results of this research.
   Most especially l owe thanks to my wife Janny for her constant dedicated assistance
during our ministry in Irian Jaya an d for m oral support during the research and
preparation of this book.
   Finally, above all I am grateful to Him Who is the ultimate Source of all wisdom and
knowledge for the opportunity to serve the people of Irian Jaya with my Una brothers and
sisters. The intricate patterns of structure in Una show to me something of the
inexhaustible wonderful riches of His handiwork.

                                          h aml ets along the southern slope s of the central cordillera of the Pegunungan
                                          Jayawijaya (Orange Mountains) in the Ey, Sayn , Mo, Yamiyl, Kiynok, Ira, Mina, Be
                                          and Yay River valleys. These valleys are located between 1390 50' and 1400 20' eastern
                                          longitude and 40 32' and 40 54' southern latitude within the boundaries of the Kecamatan
                                          Kurima, in the Kabupaten Jayawijaya, in the province Irian Jaya (formerly Dutch New
                                          Guinea) of the Republic of Indonesia.
                                              The Una2 1anguage is part of the Goliath stock level family (Voorhoeve 1975:18, 46, 67,
                                          69) of the Central New Guinea macro-phylum (SchiefenhoveI 1977:270, 275) which is also
                                          called Trans-New Guinea phylum (Voorhoeve 1975:16, 63). The term 'Goliath' (de Kock
                                          1 91 2) is based on European nomenclature (Schiefenhovel 1977:266; 1978:2). Therefore it
                                          has been suggested recently, on account of the linguistic and cultural homogeneity of the
                                          people (Schiefenhovel 1978:2) who live within a surprisingly large area of the Eastern
                                          Highlands of Irian Jaya to designate this people and their stock level language family
                                          with the term 'Mek' meaning 'water', analogous to the term 'Ok' which is used as a
                                          name for the neighbours of the 'Mek' to the East.
                                                   Four lexicographically distinct Una dialects were noticed:
                                                            1. Central Ey River Valley Dialect
                                                            2. Northern Ey River Valley Dialect
                                                            3. Sayn River Valley Dialect
                                                            4. Eastern Una Dialect
                                         onset of                   rei]
                                             Besides lexicographical differences the lack of the voiceless glottal fricative [h) as the
                                                      and [e) in the Central Ey River Valley Dialect, is also a distinctive feature of
                                         the above mentioned Una dialects. Real bilingual and multilingual speakers are rare .
                                                                                                             '
                                         However, it is p ossible that in a single village, e specially one situated near a
                                         l anguage/dialect boun dary, up to seven different dialects/languages of the Mek
                                         Language Family are spoken, which are all mutually intelligible. This is, for example,
                                         the case in the village of Langda, where, besides the previously named four Una dialects,
                                         the Eipo, Lower Sela, and Kimyal dialects are also spoken. This is mainly caused by
                                         intermarriage from neighbouring valleys. The relationship between those languages
                                         and Una as members of the Mek Language Family (Louwerse 1 9 76a, b, 1 978a, e, 1 9 82b),
                                         and the relationships of the latter to its neighbouring Trans-New Guinea Language

1.2   Content, arrangement and objective
   The approach adopted in this study is loosely according to Pike & Pike (1982), which
sees the grammar of a language as a hierarchy of levels. They attempt to develop a
the oretical framework for the analysis and description of all human behaviour,
including language, within a single model. Longacre (1 958, 1 960, 1 9 76 ) has made
several contributions to the development of this model, particularly in the area of
grammatical studies and discourse analysis. The tagmeme, the basic unit posited in this
model, is according to Pike and Pike (1 982:33):
       'a constituent of a construction seen from the point of view of its four
       general features: slot, class, role, and cohesion . . . Each feature is closely
       related to each of the other three:
                                       role       cohesion
       ... The substance that can be observed is the manifesting class ... In addition,
       there sometimes are cohesion requirements of form for the tagmeme which
       integrate it further into that stream of speech.'
6
   The nuclear or marginal characteristics of the units which occur at practically every
level of the hierarchy are specified as follows:
We assume that probably the nucleus in contrast to the margin:
      (a)   is more independent (in filling nuclear slots in higher levels or in
            dialogue s ) ;
      (b)   more frequently has the option of representing the entire unit, of which
            it is a part, in larger units; and is more likely to identify the larger
            construction of which it is a part;
      (c)   is a member of a large class (each member of which can fill the same
            slot) ;
      (d)   occurs i n more kinds o f grammatical slots than do the marginal
            classe s ;
      (e)   has the more central semantic role. (Pike and Pike 1 982 :25)
   One notion of tagmemics, as expressed by Pike and Pike (1 982:23), is that there is a
grammatical hierarchy of ten levels consisting of the following minimum units with
their expanded units: morpheme and morpheme cluster, word and phrase, clause and
sentence, paragraph and monologue, exchange and conversation. (However, not all
languages will have all levels. For example, in Una the absence of grammatical
markers and units marking C onversation as a level in the grammatical hierarchy
points to the fact that this unit in the hierarchy is not valid in Una.)
   The units of each level have a structure usually stated in terms of units of the level
below (except for the lowest, the Morpheme) and a function stated in terms of units of the
level above (except for the highest, the Conversation). In the sections which follow we start
at the word level, due to the fact that the verbal morphemes are one of the most important
parts of speech in Una, in which most of the variations occur. Then we descend to the
morpheme level and describe the morphological features before describing the phrase and
clause levels. The approach for the analysis of the word and phrase level is according to
Pike & Pike, 1982. The analysis of the clause and higher levels is according to Longacre,
1976 which includes newer additions to the tagrnemic framework, such as the distinction
between deep and surface grammar which has been popularised by proponents of
transformational-generative grammar.
   This descriptive grammar of a segment of Una grammar tries to keep as close to the
data as possible. This analysis is not an exposition of any tagrnemic theory as such with
language data used for illustrative purposes, but rather a description of language data
(Louwerse 1 983c) with comments on some theoretical issues (Louwerse & van der Wilden
1 975; Louwerse 1 978b). There is a twofold justification for such a study. Una, as a non­
Austronesian language of the C en tral New Guinea macro-phylum of Irian Jaya,
represents a family and phylum of language s still little known and less described, so
that the analysis is of interest for purely descriptive and typological purposes.
   But theoretical advances need to be tested against -as wide a variety of languages as
possible, and such testing may proceed either by selecting data from a single language or
a number of languages to illustrate and test a particular point, or by providing as full data
                                                                                              7
as possible for a selected segment of a particular grammar. Instead of selection of data in
terms of a particular current issue or theory for illustrative purposes, risking hiding of
data which may become of considerable interest, I have chosen the older approach of
description which seeks to elucidate the structure of a segment of the Una language in
terms of limits which seem to me to be suggested by the data and try to give as full data as
practical for that segment.","[14, 15, 16, 17]"
"   It can also be said that the sentence in Una con sists of an obligatory final clause, with
one or more optional medial clauses and an optional repetition/recapitulation clause.
Furthermore, the inflection of the verbs which fill the predicate slot of the clause and show
the inter-clausal structure within the sentence, reveal the class to which they belong.
They can be categorized as in Figure 40 below:

8.5.2 Surface structure encoding of information
   From the following display (cf. Figure 43) different kin ds of information about the
story of the helicopters are readily displayed. The form of this display is according to
Thurman-Grimes (1 975), and the full display can be found in Appendix A.
   The vertical columns correspond to the various kinds of information distinguished in
the text: The events which happened are indicated by predications (including quotations
in the case of speech events, and the verbs of motion are in italics), identification (I.D.),
setting (8.), background (B.), collateral (C.), and performative (P.). To prevent
crowding of the chart the convention is used that information of a particular kind begins
under the corresponding heading, but may be carried as far to the right as needed.
   The parallel vertical lines are for the participants; one line per participant. For each
real-world event a line i s drawn from the predication that represents the event to the
vertical lines that represent the participants in the event. Where identifications are
given for the participants, lines are drawn from the right hand side to show which
identification belongs to which participant. A reference to one of the participants noted
above the vertical lines at the beginning of the chart is signalled by an asterisk* .
  The Una text with a literal interlinear translation is placed to the left of the display in
numerical order.
                                                                                           133     The first distinction made in the analysis of this discourse is between EVENTS and
non-events. Primary predications (cf. 8.3.1 .4) are underlined. Long stretches of speech
are sometimes devoted to nothing but event information (especially by means of
quotations as in sentences 73-80, etc.). The rules of the reference system, by means of
verb inflection and optional pronouns, are such in Una that the hearer always knows by
deduction who is doing what (to whom). Two events, regardless of their relation to time
( C ircumstantial, B i ologi cal, Conventio nal, Natural Ph enomenal , Cultural o r
C ontextual ; cf. 3.5) are reported as Event A and Event B. Backflash is considered t o be
part of the main-line of events told out of order. They are distinct from narrative
subsequences that are told in an explanatory fashion without being in the main-line of
events.
   The information that identifies the PARTICI PANTS in an event not only links
participants to events, but also links consecutive references to the same participant.
   I D ENTIFICATION has to do with the linguistic means the speaker uses to
communicate to the hearer/audience who or what is involved. Quite often double
identification ; e.g. 'they . . . all people', or 'all of us . . . we' is shown in the surface
structure by means of a pronoun and verb inflection. Obligatory subject identification in
Una verbs (and optional pronouns or proper nouns) makes it easy and clear for the hearer
to determine who or what is being talked about without becoming confused.
  SETTING is that part of the text which provides information about where, when, and
under what circumstances actions take place. Setting can be in space and in time.
   BACKGROUND, or secondary, information is not a part of the actual development of
the topic of the discourse itself, but stands outside and clarifies it. Events, participants
and setting can be con sidered to be primary components of a di scourse, while
                                       sakweteboka-aka
explanations and comments have a secondary role which in Una is often reflected in theboboka
distinctive secondary predication morpheme
        'carrying', and sentence 1 2 :
                                                       'same actor suffix'; (e.g. sentence 7 :
                                                    'jumping'; cf. 8.3.1 .5).
   COLLATERAL text in a discourse informs the hearer/audience about what did not
happen, instead of telling what did happen; (e.g. sentence 3: ""In the Langda language we
didn't call it a helicopter""). In this example the non-event is a rhetorical underlining of
the previous event described in sentence 2.
   PERFORMATIVE information shows the influence of the speaker-hearer-situation.
In this discourse the speaker-hearer interaction can be noticed, for example, in the
opening of the discourse in sentence 1 : ""I will tell (to you) the Story of the Helicopter"", in
the closure of sentences 1 8 1 -3, but also in the body of the discourse , for example, in
sentence 1 20 : ""Their father, that's you!"".

8. EXPOSITORY DISCOURSE8.1 Introduction
   In previous chapters it has been described how the various components of Una
morphology and syntax function. We have noted that none of these levels is autonomous
and therefore it is impossible to describe the grammar of any level without reference to the
other levels.
   Although the contents of the previous chapters describe Una grammar hierarchy from
the morpheme level via word, phrase, clause and sentence up to the paragraph level, this
is still not sufficient to generate natural, i.e., well formed strings in Una monologue or
dialogue. In order to accomplish this, reference should be made to the rules operating at
the discourse level itself (cf. Louwerse 1 9 78d, 1 985d). Therefore, in this chapter, the
grammatical relationships of a specific Una discourse genre - the expository discourse -
will be described.
   The app ended n atural discourse is largely unedited, except for incidental
phonological corrections of incoherent speech. It was recorded on tape in the field and
discussed at length with Niykowdeymus B alyo, my chief language inform ant. As
spoken language within a social context, it was accepted as natural and grammatical.
Commas have been used to show where the speaker paused when giving the discourse.
     Una expository discourse may be viewed as a hierarchy made up of paragraph s,
sentences, clauses and lower grammatical levels. (It is exceptionally important to
master the Una verb morphology in order to be able to recognize the small details of the
discourse. In Una combinations of verb suff""lxes can form some 742 7 different verbs from
one verb root (cf. Louwerse, 1 982a:5) which indicate a variety of relations within the
discourse. ) It is necessary also at the same time to view the discourse as made up of a
semantic or notional structure which has three major parts, namely:
1.    the discourse topic, the topic of the exposition ,
2.    the development (or exposition) of the topic, and
3.    the closure.
   The body of the discourse, in which the topic of the exposition develops, consists of units
interrelated by three semantic relationships:
(a)   conditi on,
(b)   result, and
(c)   reason.","[134, 135]"
"   Furthermore, to insure that the peak passes by rather slowly, extensive use is made of
rhetorical underlining by means of exact repetition, slightly expanded or somewhat
cleverly disguised repetition, and paraphrase.

   The rhetorical underlining in this expository discourse has two distinctive forms :interpeak of sentences   134-136
packing and extending of the main-line. In most cases, except in the relatively brief
                              where the main-line is packed, all other peaks show a lot of                       8.6).

2.    THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE VERB
2.1   General remarks about Una verb inflection
    The intricate verb structure of Una is like that in other Papua New Guinea - Irian Jaya
languages, often comparable in role and cohesion features to the clause root. Not
infrequently a single verb form is a complete clause including agent and personal
objects as undergoer, scope or benefactee, and a significant proportion of verb inflection
signals relationships among verbs in sequence. In comparison with other languages it
is therefore rather difficult in Una to isolate morphology from syntax. The feature which
Wurm (1 969:81) calls 'one of the most striking characteristics' of highland New Guinea
languages is also true for Una: the occurrence of a clause containing an independent
sentence-final verb preceded by one or more clauses containing dependent sentence­
medial verbs marked to indicate switch reference (i.e. identity or non-identity of
grammatical subjects of the verb in the two clauses). This phenomenon of stringing
clauses together was labelled 'chaining' by McCarthy (1 965) - see also Capell (1 962:1 1 5)
                                                                                           -and has been reported for an increasing number of languages in the New Guinea - Irian
Jaya area.    The dependent aspect verb final suffixes such as simultaneous and
simulfactive aspects mark respectively the same or different subjects of actions
occurring at the same time, and in doing so keep track of the participants of actions. The
anticipatory and preview aspects mark consecutive actions marked in verbs which are
found in sequence, sometimes even beyond the sentence boundary. This phenomenon
was also noticed in Telefol to the east of Una (cf. Healey 1 966) and in Dani to the west of
Una (cf. Bromley 1 9 72).","[22, 23, 24, 25]"

4.2.5 Noun phrase coordinate complex conjoining
the addition of      ton, ab, kiya22
   There are three ways in which noun phrases may be conjoined. The most common is
                      or       'and' at the end of each noun phrase bei ng conjoined (cf.
                                                                                                                   97Figure 34). There is a somewhat predominant tendency towards the use of

of the last noun phrase as being applicable to the other noun phrases also.

   If the speaker intends any such quantifier to apply only to the one noun phrase, he wiB
do this explicitly:

4.3 Verb phrase hyper class
   The Una verb phrase hyper class (cf. Figure 35) consists of a maximum of eight
tagmemes. Only the nucleus is obligatory, and in most cases only a single verb fills the
verb phrase nucleus.","[106, 107, 108]"
"8.5.6.2 Spatial setting
   Una defines a primary setting as the area around the person from whose viewpoint the
event is told. Besides the use of proper nouns or noun phrases for locations, there are two
sets of locational deictics or demonstrative pronouns, each with proximal and di stal
forms. The first defines places and movements within (proximal) or outside (distal) the
primary setting.      Th e only distinction between th e s e two sets of l o c ational

   There exists also a set of verbs of motion used for secondary setting. They have been
identified in the Thurman-Grimes Chart in italics. The spatial setting may be redefined
during the course of a text, either by describing the location of a new setting, or by relative
redefinition by means of one of the verbs of motion, which takes the most recent setting in
relation to the narrator as its point of departure. As an example of the use of these verbs of
motion for redefinition of the spatial setting the following verb roots occur in the
identified sentences in the appended text:  bin--
  yan                 'go'                        (4,5,15,23,24,38, 43)

   Other verbs of motion which do not occur in the sample text, and which are also used for
redefinition of setting in space, are:   welebin­
   yurbin-            'ascend-go'
                      'descen d-go'

or descending always takes place on a particular surface , or in the sky, so that the
                                                                                   calls this
inseparable direction and location of the verbs of motion an 'inner locative', as opposed to
an 'outer locative', which is a separable setting.","[167, 168]"

3.3 Numerals
   The Una people use a counting system which is to a base twenty-seven system. Most
often, counting takes place in a face-to-face encounter by which the speaker points to his
upper extremities and head. He starts with the little flnger of the left hand and
continuing via the arm up over the head and down the right arm ends up with the little
flnger of the right hand, which has a numerical value of twenty-seven.                                                                             dina -baji
   Numerals are formed, with the exception of one to three and twenty-flve and twenty­
six, by the indication of the corresponding body part and a suffix           'cardinal
numeral'. From flfteen to twenty-four a preceding free form          'right hand side
78numeral' has been added indicating the right hand side of the body corresponding withby the suffix -jaba
the cardinal numeral. Twenty-five and twenty-six are distinguished from two and three                                                                     -baji.
                     and twenty-seven is distinguished from one by the actual name of the
little finger as corresponding body part, suffixed with an optional

                                                        'unit of twenty-seven' and with thiswiyniyji, ding dumbaji
number counting is usually discontinued. However, by the terms
           and
                                                       ding tentok

can still be visualized, but normally anything above
is considered to be              'many/ a lot'.

2.11.5 Successive aspect suffix
   The      (-iyji)
               suffix of a dependent sentence medial verb marks consecutive actions
performed either by the same or different actors. The dependent clause root final verb
describes a present action marked with the successive aspect suffix and precedes an
independent sentence final verb which describes a future action in the next clause. The
actor is already in the process of the action described in the dependent clause root final

since that suffix marks two future consecutive action s by the same or different actors.

2.12 Mode 2 suffixes
  In Una a set of mode 2 suffixes, which are mutually exclusive with the mode 1 infixes,
mark the psychological atmosphere of an action as interpreted by the speaker. This eigth

verb tagmeme (cf. 2.15) can be filled with interrogative, avolitional, probabilitive, causal
and hypothetical mode suffixes.

2.12.5 Potential mode suffix
   The        {-cal
              suffix of an independent sentence final verb indicates an action which very
likely will happen as a result of the action described in the preceding clause. This
marker refers to potential events. Those events might have happened in the past but did
not. In that case the semantic opposition between potentional mode and irrealis is
neutralized. Alternatively, those events might still happen in the future but are not
explicitly predicted or ordered by the speaker, in which case the semantic opposition of
hypothetical mode to potential mode is neutralized. However, the hypothetical mode isfinal verbs while the potential mode is marked by the
sentence final verb.

2.13 E nclitics
    Finally, t� e verbal complex can be modified by two types of enclitics denoting the
exclusive nature of the action described in the independent sentence final verb, or the
emphatic force of the expression. These enclitics can fill the ninth verb tagmeme (cf.

4.3.1.1 Iterative or frequentative aspect
    The iterative aspect, sometimes called frequentative aspect or, as Bromley (1972:46)
calls it, 'Abnormal continuative aspect', refers to an event or series of events continuing
over a period of time, which frequently is or will be repeated, and might be interrupted. It                                         tum tum tuba tuba
is formed by a verb inflected by a continuous tense or continuous aspect inrlX, which is
preceded by one of the free participles          or           'time and again/ over and over
again! regularly/ frequently' of the verb phrase margin-as-manner tagmeme. The
verbs within parentheses in the examples below do not belong in the margin-as-manner
tagmeme.
e . g.   1.   er Wasumuji tum tum ba-rut
              he Wasumuj i time and again go-cont t-3sg
              'He goes time and again to Wasumuji'

              he regularly that-hut enter-contAsp-3sg
              'He entered that hut regularly'
4.3.1.2 Adverbialized noun
adverbialized by means of    ato to
  The adverbialized noun can also fill the margin-as-manner tagmeme . The noun is
                            or   'like'.
e.g.     ulubyang
         fungus
                    ato   ena mem
                    like speak don't

                                                'maybe' following a verb can fill the
margin-as-limitation tagrneme. The probabilitive m ode indicates an action which i s

different case markers. A clause in Una can be described by Pike & Pike's (1 982:438)
definition
      'A clause is the minimum unit in which a proposition i s stated, i.e., in which
      something is said about terms; or in which a term (or terms) is (are) part of a
      statement, question, command, wish ; an independent clause as initiating
      speech is simultaneously a sentence.'","[110, 111, 112, 113]"

3.6 IntelTl'Ogatives
   Within the interrogatives we distinguish polar and nonpolar interrogatives. Polar
interrogatives can only be answered with 'yes' or 'no', which is not th e case with the
n on polar interrogatives.

   The nonpolar interrogative         {una}
                                      asks for information. The various tagmeme slots
for which it seeks information and the forms with which it occurs are shown in Figure 25.","[94, 95]"

                                         is considered to be a free morpheme according to       1 982:98) . However, there are some cases of
                  'why',

6.2.8 Genitive clause
   The predicative enclitic        (-cal
                                   implies the exclusive possession by the referent of a
certain object, and is always suffixed to a personal pronoun which follows the noun or
noun phrase, cf. 3.2.1 .
e . g.   a bisam ni-ja
         that pig      1 sg-PE
                                           a meyok er-ca
                                           that gourd 3sg-PE

3.1      Nouns
   A noun in Una is a word denoting semantically living beings (natural and
supernatural), things, places, or abstract ideas. This semantic information can be
derived fro m the context. A noun consists of a noun root which may be inflected for
posse ssion or be derived through nominalization. The linear structure of the n oun
complex is shown in Figure 1 4:            N=±       Mar         PllPr!il   ± Mar              d.a.ll-    +    Ny!:        NEt

                  [   +     Mar

                                                                          Mar          {-d.Ql                                                  Figure 14
C ohesion statements:
1.       Intrl (cf. 3. 6.2) and Intr2 (cf. 3.6.3) are mutually exclusive
2.       Ps and Intrl are mutually exclusive
3.       Quan occurs only by animate beings, social relationships, or kinship terms (cf.
         3.1.1)
   Except for the very limited group of nouns with the suffix                        -yabwa
                                                                         'plural', n ouns in
Una are not inflected for number. Neither definite nor indefinite articles are used. The
only optional inflection is a possessive prefix and/or an interrogative suffix.
e . g.   mutuk
         ermutuk            mountai n/h ill/area         ermutukdo
         danmutuk
                            his m ountainlh illlarea
                            is this his mountain/hill/area?
                            which mountainlhill/area?",[79]
"24.   The verb      'go' already implies that the movement is away from the narrator
      towards the goal.25.                                ururu mundu aji
      This cannot mean: 'In/at the airplane'; in that case the enclosure would have been      ururu ay umbura
      mentioned explicitly; e . g.                     lit. 'in the belly of the airplane' or
                      lit. 'in the inside of the noisy hut'.",[211]

8.2 The communication situation
   An expository discourse requires a communication situation in which one or more
individuals, who are authorities about a given subject, or at least know more than other
individuals, generate from the abstract of their discourse its full-bodied structure with all
its necessary detail and background.
   When the speaker in a non-literate, or semi-literate society wants to develop his
thoughts into a discourse he apparently starts out (as anyone must) with a backbone which
he must expand into a skeleton without the benefit of notes, and then put flesh and skin on
it so that it will result in an expository discourse which explains a subject concerning
which the speaker presumably has superior knowledge, or at least knows enough to be
able to talk intelligently. In order to influence people this speaker should have a
reputation for skillfulness in producing discourses that are acceptable to his audience.
    In the appended discourse, Karba, the speaker of the text, recounts to the author the
circumstances of the first contact with outsiders from a technological world. This
discourse is not a story because it lacks, with the exception of some embedded text in the
first paragraph, the specific narrative discourse features of chronological linkage etc.,
and shows the above mentioned expository discourse features of logical linkage and
thematic orientation. In place of agent orientation the focus in this discourse is on the
theme of the discourse i.e., the arrival of the helicopter and the consequent repercussions
in Un a society. The overall semantic structure analysis of this discourse shows a
'groun ds - CONCLUSION' semantic structure (which is a sp ecific fe ature of the
expo sitory di scourse genre). This reinforces the conclusion arrived at from the
previously described evidence which showed that this text is an expository discourse with
                                                                                          127embedded narrative discourse. The Una people made the assumption that these strange
beings, which dropped out of the sky in the belly of a noisy 'dragonfly' (helicopter), must
be spirits (Louwerse 1 981b, 1 982e, 1 985f, 1 986c) speaking a strange nonhuman language
(grounds - CONCLUSION). However, further investigation showed them that one of these
'spirits' spoke a somewhat familiar language and his explanations convinced them that
these beings must be human, notwithstanding the strange circumstances of their arrival
and their weird appearance, and therefore should be welcomed as guests of the Una
society (grounds - CONCLUSION). As in all expository discourse , whatever actions are
referred to in this discourse the agents are nonspecific and nonfocal. As an in sider of
Una culture and thought patterns the speaker is an authority who is able to explain the
repercussions of the first contact with the outside world.
    While this expository discourse is instructional, it is different from the step-by-step
n ature and th e chronological linkage which characterizes procedural di scourse .
Another feature which distinguishes this expository discourse from procedural discourse
is that the latter is characterized by reference to second person, i.e., the audience which is
being addressed by the speaker. This is not th e case in this text. The third person
dominates by far. In this respect expository discourse is more similar to narrative than
the proceduraVinstructional discourse.","[136, 137]"

2.13.2 Exclusive aspect
   The        -tok         tentok
            suffix indicates the exclusiveness of the agent of the action, and might very
well be derived from         'only.
e . g.   1.    yan-ma-y -tok
               come-incompAsp-3pl 3pst t-exclAsp
               'Only they came'
         2.    nun atam buk-ma-numa-tok
              we there sit-incompAsp-1 dl 2pst t-exclAsp
              'Only we two sat there this morning/yesterday'
         3.   sun Laji bin-ab-daw-tok
              you L aj i go-lpst t-2pl-exclAsp
              'Only you were going to Laji a while ago'
582.14 (Repetitive aspect) onomatopoeic verbs
   Most of the verbs of onomatopoeia have to do with kinetics or bodily actions. The
distinguishing feature of these verbs is that the first predicate filling the verb sternobligatorily by the inflected verb root    eb-
nucleus, represented by a verb root hyper class, has no inflection. This is followed
                                              'to say/sound'. The repetitive aspect marks
repetitions of mainly kinesic actions and occurs only in onomatopoeia. Both verb roots
are j oined under one stress of which the accent is on the first syllable of the last verb root,
and therefore in th e phonological sense comprises one word (cf. Louwerse, 1 978b:72).
However, for practical purposes it has been decided that the verb roots of the verbs of this
class, with or without the repetitive aspect marker, will be written separately. The
decision regarding this phenom enon, which is an instance of n on-congruence of
phonological and grammatical units, has been made in order to prevent very long
elaborate words with a maximum of nine syllables, which unnecessarily would have
complicated the literacy program.
     The general linear structure of this verb is as follows:        (Rep)VStHC = + Nuc            YRtHC ±      Mar    <R>     +   1Yl
                                                                      ��aMr ��

2.15 Summary of Una verb inflection
    This section aims to present illustrative material as a summary of Una verb
inflection. For a discussion of the section subdivisions see the appropriate sections. The
following types of verb stem hyper classes can fill the first tagmeme of a verb:
2.3 . 1 .1 A motion verb fills obligatorily the last slot in a verb stem hyper class with a
maximum of three verb roots:
e . g.   bong-deyriyt-yan-ma-se
         carry-deposit-come-incompAsp-1 sg pr t
         'I come carrying in order to deposit'
2.3.1 .2 A combination of two or three verb roots in a verb stem hyper class often carries
the function of the intentional mode:
e.g.     bo-dongob-ma-r
         carry-deliver-incompAsp-3sg pr t
         'Carry in order to deliver/Carry with the intention to deliver'
                                                                                                                                                        0)

622.3.1 .3 The first slot in a verb stern hyper class is in most cases filled with a verb root,
but it can also be filled with a verbalized adjective in connection with an optional
causative aspect (cf. 2.3.1 .3):
e.g.     teleb-rob-ma-r
         good-causAsp-incompAsp-3sg pr t
         'He causes (it) to be good/glad/happy'
2.3 . 1 . 4 A verbalized numeral can also fill the first slot in a verb stern hyper class:
e . g.   bitin-eyb-ma-n
         two-transVc-incompAsp-1 sg pr t
         'I double it'
2.4 For a description of the three verb classes see respectively 2.6. 1 , 2.8 and 2.1 0.2.2.
2.5 An obligatory continuous tense suffix         -nin
                                               following the verb root, with an optional
verb reduplication, signals the continuous tense and can fill the second tagrneme of a
verb:
e . g.   eb-nin (eb-nin)
         speak-cont t speak-cont t
         'Speak(s) continually'
2.6.1 The impersonal voice suffix       (-na)
                                         follows a verb root hyper class of which the final
con sonant is deleted. This suffix, which can fill the second tagrneme of a verb, forms the
infinitive and i s used in the prohibitive, permissive, indirect imperative and negative
imperative modes and habituative aspect:
e . g.   e-na
         speak-impersV c
         'It's O.K to speak, don't speak' etc.
     The following personal voice suffixes can fill the second tagrneme of a verb:
2 . 6 . 2 . 1 The causative voice suffix   (-dob)
                                               follows a verb root hyper class, which is
followed by the person-tense suffixes, and those suffIxes mark the cause of an event:
e . g.   bin-dob-ma-r
         bo-causVc-incompAsp-3ps pr t
         'He causes (him) to go'
2.6.2.2 The transitive voice suffix     (-eyb)   optionally marks a transitive verb:
         er-eyb-mo-ma
         lift-transVc-incompAsp-2sg3pst t
         'You lifted him up'
                                                                                                63
2.6.2.3 The reciprocal voice suffix
or more agents:

3.       NON-VERBAL CATEGORIES   A major morphological distinction exists between verbal and non-verbal structures.
The latter usually occur without suffixes, while the verb stem never occurs without a
suffix and usually has more than one. The non-verb stem in most cases stands alone as
a complete word, being a grammatically independent utterance.","[67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79]"

   O nly three adjectives proper indicate colours. This tripartite classification may be
interpreted as exhibiting what Berlin & Kay (1 969 :26) call 'Basic color terms stage II'
colour terminology :
         kurunllena
         mibiyyriyn (y)ikmaka
                      I
                                  light colours/white
                                  dark colourslblack, brown, green, grey
                                  red
   Una culture, which represents a non-technologically advanced culture, has only a
limited terminology to describe the colour spectrum. Besides the three adjectives
indicating 'basic colour terms', all other adjectives indicating colour occur mo stly in
highly specialized contexts and refer to certain hues. However, these terms are restricted
almost exclusively to particular substances, objects or materials with a corresponding
colour.
e.g.     kosusulya mur           white earth/chalk/pale         kumusan
         bila
                  I              red dye made of earth
                                 yellow dye made of a ginger species         kul
         sukun
                                 blue sky
                                 grey hair
                                 dark colour caused by aging/rotting (wood)/green soil
     These colour adjectives follow the noun and are optionally followed   byatolto   'like'
e . g.   1.   iym biy    ato
              sky red like
              'Morning or evening red'
         2.   ururu kala mur
              plane skin red
                                 ato
                                 clay like
              'A red airplane'
         3.   erkiysok ko         atoku-rut
              h er-head chalk like be-3sg cont t
              'She looks pale all the time'
         4.   iym bila teleb deyb-ma-r
              sky blue nice wear-incompAsp-3sg pr t
              'There is a nice blue sky'
                                                                                       81           5.   wiysiynyi otong kul
                old man     hair grey
                'The old man has grey hair'
3.5 Temporals
   Proper temporals are defined as free forms denoting semantically a temporal setting.
The proper temporals which consi st of a single word are in contrast with natural
phenomenal temporals and culturally recognized temporals which consist of a
combination of words.
The following four kinds of temporals can be distinguished:
A.       Circumstantial or biological temporals
   Time setting in Una can be established by reference to some circumstance happeningsuch as     uk, tum talak
at the time of a certain event, or to some biological stage, by means of some construction
                 or       'time/period'.
e . g.    uk tentok tum aji
          time one period at
          'Once upon a time'
                a
   The time setting can also be re-established by means of some construction with the
m orpheme 'that' and one of the circumstantial or biological temporals.
e.g.      a talak aji
          that time at
          'At that time'
          a kalingnamnyi talak aji
          that they-waited time at
          'During that time when they waited'
Time may also be in relation to other events,
e . g.    ni dianyi talak aji
          I I - die   time    at
          'Around the time of my death'
          er deybci tum aji
          he she-bore time at
          'At the time of his birth'
B.       Conventional temporals
   The Una people di stinguish the followng conventional temporals which form two
triplets (cf. Figure 23):

                     Figure    23. Conventional temporal diagram I
    C onventional temporals of near past and future are part of a centred set which can be
illustrated by m eans of the set of concentrical ellipses of Figure 24. This kind of time
expressions which only indicate temporal distance from the present are common to
highland New Guinea - Irian Jaya languages. The component of past or future is
signaled by the verb tense.","[88, 89, 90, 91, 92]"
"    Less important actions are marking increased background colour and detail. They
are indicated by secondary predications with the suffix
following the verb root. etc.
                                                                'same actor marker'                                 -aka
   Summarizing the rest of the main-line from dynamic toward static we find backflash
used for decrease of main-line flow, and therefore this probably should be somewhat
lower than backgroun d secondary predications. Non-preterite predications containing
tenses such as present, present perfect, and future, which figure in narrative mainly in
quotes and in awareness depiction, come somewhere down in succession . They are
followed by sentence initial coordinate conjunctions (cf. 8 . 5 . 5 . 1 . 1 ) which replace
sentence initial dependent preview verbs. Even further down come nominals, acting as
identifiers for participant identification due to lack of sentence final full inflection verbs
and deletion of setting, terminus and formulaic quotation endings.

8.5.6.5 Peak and profile
   H aving described some features of the communication setting in which the expository
discourse was created and the grammatical hierarchy of the discourse, I have de scribed
the notional relationship within the expository discourse: condition, result, and reason.
In the following chapters some features of the surface realization of the notional structure,
or the spectrum of the expository discourse were analyzed. These were divided into
primary and secon dary p arameters.            Th e former included chron o l ogical and
thematic/logical cohesion and participant orientation, and the latter included setting
( sp atial and temporal ) , performative information, and other information such as
background and collateral information (see Figure 43).            Next foregrounded and
background ed, or primary and secondary predications features have been described.
The expo sitory discourse, however, contains not only this spectrum of information, but it
has also a profile; i . e . the contour of a spoken or written discourse which shows the
differing levels of excitation and tension. The appended discourse shows six cumulative
development areas (cf. Figure 49) in which the flow of discourse seems to quicken and
grow more turbulent. These areas we will call peaks. These peaks   1.   correlate with underlying notional categories;
   2.   show specific surface structure markers;
   3.   are more difficult to analyze due to abnormal grammatical features; and
   4.   are features which serve to give profile t o the discourse.","[170, 171]"

3.1.2    Nominalizers
  Two classes of nominalizers are found in Una with inflected number: (1 )
nominalizers of adjectives, locatives and demonstratives, (2) nominalizers of verbs.

8.3.1.5 Secondary predications
suffix -oka
   A SECONDARY predication is also expressed by a medial verb, but is identified by th e                                                                  binmarey
            'same actor indicator', marking a non -finite verb. For example, the first
clause of sentence 1 5 has only one primary predication, viz. ,         'they two went',the free form

indicated by the verbal tense- aspect- subject- person and number indicators, foll owed by               kuboka               anaboka
                     'after'. Preceding this primary predication are two secon dary
                        'being' and           'appearing', which are subordinate to the
primary predication.
  The primary predication in the sequence         kuboka anaboka binmarey ani,   (being
appearing they-two-went after) 'after they two had been (inside) they appeared (outside)
130and went away' is: 'they two went away'. The narrator has chosen the ""had been inside
and appeared outside"" as supplementary in order to set the stage for the ""went away"" .
      D ependent verbs also indicate secondary predications.                       They have a lower
hierarchical function than the independent verbs. The dependent verbs indicate switch­
reference of participants and temporal, or pseudo-temporal reference between the events.                     diybde bukmaryak
This can be accomplished by means of the simultaneous aspect suffix                       (- iyjak) (cf. 2.1 1 .1 );
e.g. sentence 53:                 ebmaybokbukmaybok
(they shouted)', or by means of the simulfactive aspect suffix
sentence 73:

said).' Furthermore, the dependent verbs can signal that a certain event occurred at an                                   yanmayobora                                                   or            (cf.or in sentence 98:

                                                           (came- they- plural- after) 'after they came';
                                             (asked- they- plural- after) 'after they asked'. The

                                                                    (-nyura)
after another event. Two future consecutive actions which will occur are indicated by                 (-nyi)                                                     (cf. 2 . 1 1 .3), and the causal
                         (cf. 2 . 1 2.4) which indicates an action which expresses the cause
of/grounds for an action by a different actor described in the following clause.
   In summary, switch-reference in Una proceeds by means of the medial verbs, or the
                                          �ura (-iyjokJ, (-iyji) (-nyura) -bok-bak
medial verb phrase, which indicate whether or not the subject of the second of two
successive clauses will be the same as the subject of the first. The verb suffix    predicts
a change of subject. The verb suffixes                          and           may indicate a-ura
change of subject, but this does not necessarily have to be so. The verb suffixes(- iyjak)
     do not predict the person and number of the new subject. The verb suffixes         -bok
                                                                                         and
                                                                                         and                   -ura, (- iyji) (-nyura)

8.4 The Notional relationship
   The semantic, or notional, structure of this Una expository discourse interrelates, and
gives cohesion to, three types of subtopics indicating a CONDITION, REAS ON or
RESULT as a subtopic in the development of the topic of the discourse. The exposition of
the topic, which is stated in the opening (cf. 8.3. 1 . 1 ), can be quite general, or very detailed.
The number of subtopics depends on the amount of detail of the exposition: the more
detailed the exposition is, the more subtopics will be introduced. These subtopics are all
                                                                                           131within the context of the topic of the exposition and related to each other by some sort of
chronological or thematic-logical linkage.
   As stated above, these subtopics are developed by resort to a threefold notional
relationship : condition, result and reason. Usually, but not always, they occur in that
order. (For a description of exceptions to this order, cf. 8.5.5.1 .2.)
    The condition usually is a certain event or state of affairs which leads to another event
or state, which is the logical result of an event following the initial condition. This result
might be something which automatically follows a given condition, or some volitional
response to the condition. However, sometimes the condition-re sult sequence is not
strictly of the 'if-then' sort; it might be a probl em (needing solution), or a
puzzling/inciting incident (cf. sentence 50-53 , 56-57, 1 32 etc.). The result, or response, is
always significant because it leads to a new paragraph which is a part of the development
of the topic/theme of the discourse.
   The reason is also an important part in the development of a paragraph, due to the fact
that it provides the explanation for the outcome or response. (For a description of thenormal amount of curiosity found universally among       homo sapiens
different subtopics within a paragraph cf. 8.5.5.1 .2.) The Una people apparently have the
                                                                       in that they want to
find out the reason why things are the way they are (Louwerse 1 986f, 1 987c, 1 988b). But
more than that, they show a strong tendency to interpret events and conditions as being
the result of previous events and conditions, due to the fact that in a non-technologically
advanced/animistic environment there needs to be a reason/explanatory cause for
everything, either naturally or super-naturally. This is very apparent from their culture
which extensively resorts to mythological explanation (cf. Louwerse, 1 981a, b).","[139, 140, 141]"

2.10 Tense-actor suffIXes
    In the preceding sections the voice, tense-aspect, personal object and some mode
markers were de scribed and the formal elements corresponding with the specific
38m eaning analyzed. In this section the ten se-actor marker which can fill the sixth
tagmeme slot (cf. 2.15) will be described. In some cases the phonological fusion of these
morphemes has progressed to the degree that partials are difficult to define and describe
as such . In those cases we will treat them as portmanteau. As stated in 2.9.1 , this
treatment as portmanteau of partial s and patterns reflected in the subject suffix
portmanteau is not completely satisfying, but has to do for now since the necessary sub­
analysis falls outside the main scope of th is work. It is planned to describe the sub­
analysis of subject sufflx portmanteaus in another paper. If individual morphemes can
be identifled, we will treat them as a compound. The criteria to distinguish the tense­
actor suffixes from one another are in the form of the following seven triplets:
Triplet 1 .   First, second and third person
Triplet 2.    Singular, dual and plural
Triplet 3 .   Past, present and future tense
Triplet 4.    Remote, regular and near past tense
   Those morphemes distinguish betw�en actions which took place respectively at a
relatively remote time before the speech event but minimally two days, and usually
several weeks or months ago, versus 8 - 48 hours ago, versus just a while ago. The time
threshold of contrast is somewhat flexible between the speciflc tenses, depending on the
viewpoint of the narrator about the relative length of time elapsed between the narrated
event and the speech event.
Triplet 5.    Near, regular and remote future tense
   These distinguish between actions which will take place right now, versus in a while,
versus later on in the future, respectively. Here too , as with the past tenses, the time
threshold is somewhat flexible.
Triplet 6.    Perfect, pluperfect and future perfect relative tense
   These distinguish between a prior action in relation to the present, versus a prior
action in relation to the past, versus a prior action in relation to the future, respectively.
   The tense-actor suffixes are normally used in combination with one of the following
three aspects:
Triplet 7.    Completive, incompletive or continuous aspect
   These distinguish th e point of focus of the subj ect on a past or future action, dependingaction. The incomplete aspect suffix     {-rna}
on whether the result is, or is not, current at the point of reference, or is a continuous
                                               in combination with the tense-actor suffix is
normally used in narrative discourse because it describes an event which happened at a
previous time, but which is still relevant to the narrator or his/her audience and therefore
viewed as an incomplete event.
  The ten se-actor suffixes can be grouped in three categories according to their
morphological form :
                                                                                          39Category I .     Past tenses including:
                 1.     remote past tense (3pst t)
                 2.     regular past tense (2pst t)
                 3.     near past tense (lpst t)
                 4.     pluperfect relative tense (pluperf reI t)
                 5.     future perfect relative tense (fut perf reI t)
Category II.     Present and future tenses including:
                 1.     present tense (pr t)
                 2.     future tense (fut t)
                 3.     perfect relative tense (perf reI t)
Category III.    Continuous tense (cont t)
Note:    In the tense-actor suffix matrix (Figure 1 1 ) braces are put around the regularized
         form to indicate what morpheme is being symbolized without attention to the
         well-defined, regular alternants of pronunciation. In this way, we will
         temporarily ignore low-level complexities in order to concentrate on a higher
         layer of structure.
  The basic suffixes of Figure 1 1 can be converted into the surface suffixes by means of
morphophonemic rules (cf. 1 .5).

2.11 Dependent aspect suffixes
   In Una a set of dependent aspect suffixes are the means used to keep track of th e
participants in the actions to indicate the identity or non-identity of the actors, and the
kind of actions, and the relationships between verbs in sequence across clause root,
clause, and sometimes sentence boundaries. They describe simultaneous, simulfactive,
dependent anticipatory, and dependent preview aspects of actions. The se dependent
aspect suffIXes fill the seventh verb tagmeme (cf. 2.15).
   We will first present an overview of th e switch-reference suffixes and their
parameters as an introduction to the manner in which the Una speakers keep track of the
various participants involved in the actions in a discourse before describing in more
detail the specific dependent aspect suffixes.
and in one case (i.e. the potential mode suffix  (-cal)
    In summary, switch-reference in Una proceeds by means of the sentence medial verbs
                                                         by mean s of the sentence final verb
in combination with the sentence medial verb. These suffixes indicate whether or not the
                                    -bok
subject of the second of two successive clauses will be the same as the subject of the first.
    The simulfactive aspect suffix
at the same time. The simultaneous aspect suffix        {-iyjok}
                                           predicts a change of actor(s) of actions occurring                                                                                 -ura, -uca
                                                              marks actions occurring at the-obora
same time by the same actor(s). The dependent preview aspect suffIXes                    and                                                                        {-nyura} {-nyobora}
       are used in free variation to indicate past consecutive actions, either by the same or
different actors. The dependent anticipatory aspect suffixes                and           aresame or different actors. The successive aspect suffix        {-iyji}
used in free variation to indicate the first of two future con secutive actions either by the
                                                                   indicates a present actionactors. The causal mode suffix    {-nyi}
which precedes a future action expressed in the next clause, either by the same or different
                                         in dicates an action which precedes and expressesfollowing clause. The potential mode suffix     (-ca}
the cause of/grounds for an action by a different actor which is expressed by a verb in the
                                                        (which is the only dependent aspect
suffix which occurs exclusively in sentence final position) refers back to the action                       -ura, -uca -obora.
expressed in the preceding clause in a dependent sentence medial verb with a dependent
preview aspect suffix              or           It indicates an action which very likely will
happen as a result of the previous action , either by the same or different actors.

2.11.1 Simultaneous aspect suffix
   The         suffIx marks actions occurring at the same time by the same actor. The
dependent sentence medial verb is marked with the simultaneous aspect suffix and
precedes an independent sentence final verb in the next clause. This does not mean that
the number of clauses in a sentence is limited to two; other clauses can precede the clause
with the simultaneous aspect suffix verb which is followed by the sentence final clause.

its use in the description of languages in general, but according to its use in some
descriptions of languages with comparable features, e.g. , Loving and McKaughan

1964:3; Bromley 1972:562ff; Heeschen 1978:25; and Fahner 1979:43, 44. Grouping verbs
into these classes has proven to be valuable since it makes the description of many
categories more intelligible and shorter7• The criteria to distinguish these verb classes
from one another are in the form of two triplets8, verb suffixation and final consonants.","[27, 28, 29]"

   The       (-ma)
                suffix marks an incomplete aspect, expressing that an action took place
earlier on or will take place in the future, but its result is current at the point of reference.
Therefore this morpheme is very common and acts as a feature of narrative discourse.
Heeschen ( 1 9 7 8 :27) formulates the function of a similar morpheme in Eipo with these
word s :
        'The subject does n o t focus on the end or beginning o f a state, process o r
        action : the subject i s participating i n , and h a s sensual experience o f the
        states, processes, and action which are seen from the standpoint of the subject
        en gage d.'
 This suffix can fill the third column of the third tagmeme, i.e. the tense-aspect suffix
marker tagmeme (cf. 2 . 1 5).

2.8 Undergoer/scopeJbeneficiary pronoun suffixes
    In Una a set of undergoer/scope/beneficiary pronoun suffixes filling the fourth verb
tagmeme indicates: (1 ) the undergoer, i.e. th e person or persons undergoing the action,
or (2) the scope, i.e. the direction or the goal toward or away from which the action is
directed, or (3) the benefactee, i . e. the person(s) receiving/benefitting from the action.
These categories depend on the context in which the verb occurs. The suffixes, which
indicate the personal obj ects, distinguish between singular and plural categorie s (cf.
Figure 8). All plural suffixes are alike, and the singular categories are marked for first
and second person singular and unmarked for third person singular:

2.9 Mode 1 suffi xes
   The      {-til
              suffix marks a desi derative or hypothetical mode expressing the result in
case an action happens or indicating a desire to act. This morpheme i s homophonous
with the aptative aspect marker (cf. 2.7.1 .5). Besides the hypoth etical or desiderativeimperative, and hortative or deliberative mode suffixes       {-du}
suffixes thi s fifth verb tagrneme (cf. 2 . 1 5 ) can be filled by the imperative, polite

2.9.1 Imperative mode inflection
  The imperative mode of an independent sentence final verb contrasts an unmarked
immediate tense with a marked near, regular, or remote deferred tense. The imperative
mode verb can be specified either with a continuous tense, or incomplete aspect marker.
                               ok, -n -b
   In the following verb paradigms suffixation of the three basic verb root classes, i.e.
verb roots with final         or
environments), will be displayed.
                                   (all of which are deleted or changed in certain
    Una verb subject combinations, which denote person and number (cf. Figure 9),
cannot always be easily segmented. This i s a common phenomenon in Irian Jaya - New
Guinea highland languages as has been described for other languages in this area.
Deibler (1 976 :25-34) has attempted segmentation of the verb subject combinations and
described in detail the patterns they show. However, presentation of compound suffix
sets, including these subject indicators, have been preferred by the majority of analysts
above segmentation of these combinations (see Deibler, 1 9 76:23 op. cit. , fn. 1 0; Bromley,
1 9 72: Appendix A, etc.). Therefore we will give paradigms throughout the work to
illustrate the all omorphic variations of these morphemes. Glosses will be omitted from
the paradigms. Just one identifying gloss of verb roots and for labelling of inflectional
categories will be given ; the rest are self-explanatory.
    However, Figure 9 sh ows that the use of a matrix segmentation is helpful in
illuminating the differences between the morphemes. Certain patterns show up in this
basic analysis of the nine distinct suffixes:

                        Figure 10. Subject suffix combination patterns   Presentation of sub-analyses of obvious partials and patterns reflected in th e basic
subject suffix combinations is desirable, since comparison with other sets most certainly
will reveal interesting patterns which are not obvious from the paradigms. However, this
will not be attempted here, but described in another paper since it falls outside the main
scope of this work.","[36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]"

   Una is a pitch-accent language, there being one accent-carrying syllable on each
phonological word. Words can have from one to nine syllables . Mono syllabic words can
be accented or unaccented. Unaccented monosyllabic words carry a low pitch or a pitch
which glides upward slightly from low. In any case, such a pitch is lower than the high of
the accented syllable.","[18, 19]"

Conclusion
   I n the preceding chapters all Una word classes which can be distinguished formally
have been described. A description in detail of all the word classes which semantically
could be distinguished in Una (cf. Louwerse 1 985c) falls outside this analysis of the
morphophonemics and word level. The morphology, while being concerned with words,
leaves out of consideration those words which cannot be grouped within a morphological
category. However, such words will be classified on the basis of their syntactical
behaviour in the description of the higher levels of the grammar.
4. INTRA·CLAUSAL SYNTAX: PHRASE STRUCTURE
4.1 Introduction
   In this chapter the grouping of words into phrases will be described. A phrase in Una
can be described by Pike & Pike's (1 982 :453) definition :
     'A phrase i s a term which i s a nonpropositional sequence of words, with a
     nuclear word or conjunct of words with its marginal, modifying words; or
     a single word expandable into a phrase but temporarily fully filling the
     higher slot.'
   Many examples which are given in this chapter are used to illustrate less than
complete utterances. Such examples are not concluded by a period, since this symbol has
been reserved for utterances which may occur independently.","[99, 100, 101]"
"11.    Suprasegmental notation will b e used only in the description of the pronoun classes
       to show the distinction between second and third person plural m arkers. Elsewhere
       tone will not be marked on these pronouns since the person and number will be
       apparent from the verb inflection.",[210]
"6.2      Single clauses   The minimal form of a sentence contains only one explicit or implicit final primary28
predication verb. The various types of clauses are presented below:6.2.1     Independent declarative clause      Th e constituents of this independent declarative clause have been described in 5 . 2 .e . g.    1.   ey        sak-ma-r

               'He walked to that village'6.2.2     Quotative clause      A quotative clause consists of quote preceded by an optional subject tagmeme and
verb phrase such a s    eb-
preceded or followed by an optional predicate tagmeme filled by a prim ary predicate or
                        'say/speak/tell' etc., denoting a communication act.e . g.    1.   ""Ukula mem"" ata eb-ma-y

6.2.3 Identification clause
    An indentification clause consists of two or more noun phrases with an optional
p rimary predication.e.g.     1.   A Basekaliy nang, ton Korubun nang (ku-nung)

              'These are Pass Valley people, and he is from Koruppun'6.2.4 Equational clause
    An equational clause consists of a subject tagmeme and a predicate tagmeme which is
filled by a noun phrase or locative and does not include a primary predication.e . g.   1.   A niynyi asiy, sun iysa
              these people   NOM they ghosts
              'These people are ghosts!'","[126, 127]"

action, consists of two categories filling two distinguished tagmemes:         Class I :    Impersonal voice
         Class II:    Personal voice2.6.1     Impersonal voice suffix    The impersonal voice verb complex is expressed by a verb root hyper class, the
members of which have the final consonant deleted, and which is expanded by a rona)
suffix forming the infinitive. This form, filling the second, (i.e. final) verb tagmeme of
the impersonal voice verb hyper class, is used in the prohibitive, permissive, indirect
imperative, and negative imperative modes, and the habituative or customary aspect. In
all the above-mentioned modes and aspects the impersonal voice suffix is structurally the
same but differs only in the filler of the last slot which indicates the meaning.                        -ng
Morphophonemic rule:              Regressive assimilation occurs as follows:         -na     ->           /   --     k
1 . Prohibitive mode   The prohibitive or remonstrative mode is used prior to, or following initiation of an
undesirable action which is expressed in the verb, or when this action seems to be activelyinfinitive form is followed by the free particle           mem

                                                      'prohibited/forbidden'.e . g.   1.   bu-na mem

               s p e ak -infin O . K.
              'It is O.K to speak'3. Indirect imperative mode  The indirect imperative mode is used when giving orders to somebody to be passed on,mode of the verb    eb-
and i s formed by the infinitive of a verb of action, followed by the immediate imperative
                     'say/tell' (cf. 2.9.1 . 1 ).e . g.   1.   bu-na eb-ru-m
               sit-infi n say-IImpMode-2sg

              'You two say: Write (it down)'4. Negative imperative mode
   The negative imperative mode is used prior to, or following, the initiation of an
undesirable action which is expressed in the verb, or when this action seems to be activelyThe negative imperative mode is formed by the infinitive, followed by    kum
contemplated. Such an expression is less strong than one using the prohibitive mode.

   In Una the verbal tense is very closely associated with the independent aspect
markers, which specify the kind of action(s) and whether or not the action(s) took place
earlier on, or will take place in the future. These tense-independent aspect suffixes fill
the third verb tagmeme slot. However, this suffix combination can be segmented in the
following three columns: Aspect I, Tense, and Aspect II markers.","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]"

3.2.3 and 4.2.2. These locatives are used in Una to describe 'positions in space which a
solid can occupy in relation to another solid and . . . the horizon' (Hollenbach, 1 9 78:1 0).
   A solid may be either inside or outside, in proximity to , or at remote distance from,
another solid. A solid in proximity to another solid, which means not across a declivity,
and in line with the horizon, may be touching it, adj acent to it, or relatively nearby.
When at a remote distance, it mean s automatically that the solid is located across a
declivity2 0 either at a relatively near or far away location.

4.2 Noun phrase
   There are eight tagmemes (cf. Figure 28) in a Una noun phrase which may be filled,
although it is rare for all slots to be represented simultaneously. Only the nucleus is
obligatory and consequently many noun phrases consist only of a single noun or proper
noun.",[101]

3.8 Exclamations
    Exclamations are defined as those free forms which take neither verb nor noun
affixation, nor form the basis of derived forms. They commonly occur in isolation. The
most common exclamations are:

6.2.9 Infinite verbal clause    Single clauses can contain besides the obligatory explicit or implicit final primary
predication (cf. 6.2) also one or more verbs indicated by a verb stem with the suffix
Those verbs denote that a secondary action is performed by the same actor as that of the
                                                                                        -oka.

              'After both of them had searched and set traps they caught a marsupial'
6.2.10 Repetitive infinite verbal clause
   Repetitive infinite verbs denote repetitions of mainly kinesic actions of illustrative or
background events in the discourse. These actions cover only a short period of time, in
contrast to the iterative or frequentative aspect verbs (cf. 4.3.1 .1).

              'We were hiding everywhere'6.2.11 Sequential infinite verbal clause
   Sequential infinite verbs denote illustrative or background events of the discourse in
conse cutive order. The occurrence of the sequential form of infinite verbs is limited.
The linear sequence parallels the temporal sequence; i . e . , the first infinite verb denotes
the first of sequential events, etc.e . g.   1.   kub-oka anab-oka bin-ma-y
              be-ing    appear-ing go-incompAsp-3pst t 3pl
              'Mter they had been (inside) they appeared (outside) and went away'         2.   cung bin-doka iyriybtaleb-oka kiyb-m-ow

              'Mter he sat (there) he arose and climbed (the mountain)'6.3 Multiple clause sentence
   In case a sentence contains two or more clauses chained together, the verbs of all but
the final clause are dependent verbs. Only the verb of the final clause is an independent
verb.","[129, 130]"
"   The general ratio of verbs to nonverbs in Una expository discourse i s one : three and a

some significant features of tension-building by apostrophe. This turns the attention
suddenly aside from waiting for the arrival of the aircraft to a rather unrelated topic of a
caught buzzard which everybody touched. An analysis of the culture and the myth s and
checking with informants showed that this had nothing to do with the events which were
about to happen, and therefore this turn of attention can only be explained as a means of
tension building.",[174]
"8.5.6.1.3 Natural phenomenal time setting
  Time in reference to a certain p osition of sun, moon and stars i s also frequently used.
Una has an extensive vocabulary for time reference in relation to these celestial bodies.
Time reference by means of the seasons also belongs in this category (cf. 3.5.C).",[167]
"2.   This analysis draws o n several different sources of data. Probably the most
     important source is familiarity and fluency gained by constant use of the Central
     Ey River Valley Una dialect and familiarity with the three other Una dialects
     during most of my eleven years of residence in the area. The second is an
     extensive lexical file (Louwerse 1 9 85c) mainly of the previous mentioned dialect,
     with notations of each of the other dialects, together with a body of verb paradigms
     and some language learning materials, all collected or prepared in the course of
     my linguistic investigations and missionary service. This work h as benefited
     from several computer printouts, namely word concordances of Una text materials
     and an alphabetisation and revisal of the lexicon on Datapoint and Digital DEC
     VT- 1 23 computers. I am indebted to the Summer Institute of Linguistics computer
     program manager Mr Maarten te Hennepe in Ukarumpa, Papua New Guinea for
     thi s extensive work. The narrower base for the study is a collection of transcribed
     recorded texts, including folk tales, myths, expositions of local cultural activities
     and narratives of events both recent and long ago. In general, every major point in
     the description rests on data included in the filed corpus.",[209]
