EARLIER STUDIES OF C H A M O R R O
1.3     In addition to the complete listing of studies of the C h a m o r r o
        language given in the bibliography, I would like to single out
        seven of them for special mention. They are listed in chronologi-
        cal order.
        Father Sanvitores. The earliest known grammar of C h a m o r r o
        was written by Father Sanvitores in 1668. This work, of consider-
        able interest to the comparative or historical linguist, doubtless
        bears the distinction of being the first grammar of any Microne-
        sian language. Written in Latin, it follows the pattern of most
        other grammars of the seventeenth century. For example, the
        author takes such a word as taotao ' m a n ' and puts it through the
        nominative, genitive, dative and accusative cases, even though
        the word remains as taotao, with no change, throughout the
INTRODUCTION                                                                        5        declension. Father Sanvitores claims to have been divinely in-
        spired to learn Chamorro in an incredibly short period of time.
        William Safford. Aside from a Spanish grammar by Mata y
        Araujo in 1865, William E. Safford's The Chamorro Language
        of Guam (1903-1905) was the next study of the language after
        an interim of well over a hundred years. (A Spanish grammar of
        Chamorro by del Carmen is reported to have been published in
        Manila in 1865, but I have not been able to obtain it.)
             Safford was undoubtedly one of the most perceptive Ameri-
        cans ever to visit the Marianas, for after spending only one year
        (1899-1900) on Guam as an aide to the first American governor,
        he made significant contributions in several areas, notably botany
        and language. Considering that he had no previous material to
        go by, Safford's two separate works on the plants and language
        of Guam are quite remarkable.
             No linguist, Safford reacted to this new language in a predic-
        table manner: in addition to making frequent comparisons
        with similar words from other Austronesian* languages, he
        set up a Latin grammar framework and discussed the features
        of Chamorro grammar that would fit into the framework. He
        included long lists of ""irregular"" forms of verbs and nouns, but
        they were irregular only because Safford did not see the regularity
        of the patterns since he was looking at them from the point of view
        of Latin grammar.","[16, 17]"

PASSIVE V O I C E4.12    The passive voice in Chamorro is not as clear cut as we might like
        it to be for purposes of describing the language. Both Costenoble
        (1940:314-316) and Safford (1909:61) describe two forms of the
SYNTAX                                                                       257         passive voice. One of the forms uses the infix -in- (which we have
         defined as goal focus) while the other uses the prefix ma-. Safford
         claims that the passive voice is formed by using -in- when the agent
         is singular or dual, and by ma- when the agent is plural. Costen-
         oble sets up a ""subjective genitive passive"" which uses -in- and
         an ""objective genitive passive"" which uses ma-.
               In our analysis we have stated that the infix -in- is used in goal
         focus constructions when there is an agent and when the focus
         is on the goal of the action. The passive voice is another con-
         struction which uses the prefix ma- and which contains no agent.
         The following sentence is an example of a passive voice con-
         struction in Chamorro:
               Masangan na maolek iya Guam.
               'It is said that Guam is good.' or 'They say that Guam is good.'
               In this particular sentence it is difficult to ascertain whether
         the prefix ma- is actually a passive marker or the third person
         plural pronoun ma meaning 'they.' And in most cases it doesn't
         make any difference whether the gloss is 'they', as in the English
         impersonal 'They say that war is cruel,' or straight passive, as in
         'It is said that war is cruel.'
               In other cases, however, it is easier to determine that the
         verb with the prefix ma- is clearly a passive construction rather
         than a verb with the third person plural pronoun. Compare the
         grammatical structures of the following two sentences:
               (1) Manlinalatde i famagu'on ni ma'estron-niha.
                   'The children were the ones that were scolded by their tea-
                   chers.'
               (2) Manmalalatde i famagu'on gi eskuela.
                   'The children were scolded at school.'
         Sentence (1) above contains the goal focus infix -in- which places
         the emphasis on the goal 'children'. Sentence (2) contains the
         passive prefix ma- which also has the effect of placing some em-
         phasis on the goal, but only when there is no subject actor.
              If, in the second sentence, the ma- were the subject pronoun
         ma meaning 'they,' then the preceding plural marking prefix
         man- would not be permitted. Notice the contrast between the
         following two sentences:
               Ma lalalatde i famagu'on.
               'They are scolding the children.'
               Manmalalalatde i famagu'on.
               'The children are being scolded.'
258                                                                           SYNTAX                When the goal is plural, the function of the passive marker ma-
                is quite clear. However, when the goal is singular, the sentence
                can then be ambiguous, as is the following:
                      Malalalatde i patgon.
                      'The child is being scolded,' or 'They are scolding the child.'
                In order to avoid this ambiguity in the writing system we write
                the pronoun ma as a separate word and the passive marker ma-
                as a prefix. Thus, we get the following:
                      Ma lalalatde i patgon.
                      'They are scolding the child.'
                      Malalalatde i patgon.
                      'The child is being scolded.'
                     Verbs containing the passive prefix can be nominalized
                through the process of reduplication (cf. 3.3.5 and 4.3). The
                following examples will illustrate this process:
           Root                    Root + Passive                Reduplicated Form
       kanno'     'eat'       makanno'     'be eaten'       mámakanno'       'edible'
       gimen      'drink'     magimen      'be drunk'       mámagimen        'drinkable'
       chupa      'smoke'     machupa      'be smoked'      mámachupa        'smokeable'
       tuge'      'write'     matuge'      'be written'     mámatuge'        'writeable'
       taitai     'read'      mataitai     'be read'        mámataitai       'readable'
                     The passive marker ma- is probably related to the ma- found
                in so many modifiers, such as malingu, malangu, magof and ma'i'ot,
                and it may also be related to the verb prefix ma- discussed in 3.5.3.
                Perhaps some day the riddles surrounding ma- can be answered.","[268, 269, 270]"
"Some examples of verbs that could substitute for li'e'              are as

       in which case the subject pronoun ha must be used with singular
       subjects and the pronoun ma is used with plural subjects, as in the
       following examples:              I lahi ha li'e' i palao'an.        'The man saw the woman.'
              I lalahi ma li'e' i palao'an.      'The men saw the woman.'","[96, 97]"

F O R E I G N INFLUENCES ON C H A M O R R O
1.4      Like a canoe blown by many winds, the Chamorro people and
         language have been subjected to several different foreign influ-
         ences. All of these have left some mark on the language.
         Spanish. The most notable influence on Chamorro language and
         culture came from the Spanish. In addition to bringing Chris-
         tianity and its many cultural by-products to the Marianas, they
         brought a language which left a permanent mark on Chamorro.
         There was wholesale borrowing of Spanish words and phrases
         into Chamorro, and there was even some borrowing from the
         Spanish sound system. But this borrowing was linguistically
         superficial. The bones of the Chamorro language remained intact;
         a little Spanish flesh was added through vocabulary borrowing,
         but Chamorro remained basically Chamorro.
               In virtually all cases of borrowing, Spanish words were
         forced to conform to the Chamorro sound system. For example,
         from Spanish verde 'green' we get Chamorro betde, and from
         Spanish libro 'book' we get Chamorro lepblo. The substitution of
INTRODUCTION                                                                 7        Chamorro sounds for Spanish sounds is quite consistent, and is
        discussed under section 2.9 ""Chamorrocized Spanish.""
             For examples of how Spanish words were forced to conform
        to the rules of Chamorro grammar, note the following:               Spanish:    cuentos 'to talk'
               Chamorro:   Kumekuentos hao.
                           'You are talking.'
               Spanish:    cuenta 'count'
               Chamorro:   Hu kuentatayi hao.
                           'I am substituting for you.'
               Spanish:    espia 'spy'; adelantar 'to advance'
               Chamorro:   Ha espipiha mo' na i adelanton i tano'.
                           'He is looking for improvement of the land.'
               Spanish:     ganar 'to gain'
               Chamorro:    Kuarentai tres ha' i tata gi ora ginanna-ria.
                            'The father earned only forty-three cents an hour.'
               (Notice that in the last Chamorro sentence three additional
               Spanish words occur—kuarenta, tres, ora— in unaltered forms.)
            While Spanish may have left a lasting mark on Chamorro
        vocabulary, as it did on many Philippine and South American
        languages, it had virtually no effect on Chamorro grammar.
        German. The German period of influence in the Marianas was
        relatively brief (1899-1914) and was confined largely to Saipan.
        Since the Germans did not set up an elaborate administrative
        system for their new colony, they exerted much less influence,
        both cultural and linguistic, than did the Spanish. Very few
        German vocabulary items found their way into Chamorro, and
        the German influence on Chamorro grammar was nil.
        Japanese. Japanese influence on Chamorro was much greater than
        that of German, but much less than Spanish. The Japanese
        influence, like the German, was pretty well confined to the north-
        ern Marianas, especially Saipan. Once again, the linguistic in-
        fluence was restricted exclusively to vocabulary items, many of
        which refer to manufactured objects such as denke' 'flashlight'
        and chirigame' 'toilet paper'. Many Saipanese became fluent and
        literate in the Japanese language; if the period of Japanese domi-
        nation of the Marianas had been longer, the linguistic influence
        would undoubtedly have been much greater.
        English. The influence of English on Chamorro has been great,
        especially in Guam. Since 1898, when Captain Henry Glass sailed
8                                                   INTRODUCTION      The Charleston into Apra Harbor, English has been used in
     Guam in an ever-increasing amount. It is the official language of
     Guam, is used as the medium of instruction in both public and
     private schools, and is used almost exclusively for newspaper,
     radio and TV communication. In Guam, most people know
     some English, and literacy in English is practically universal
     among the younger generation.
           In the northern Marianas, English in not so widely used as
     it is in Guam. It was not used at all in the northern islands until
    after World War II, and then only sparingly by the administering
    authorities and in the schools. It was not until after 1961, when
    the Trust Territory Headquarters moved to Saipan, that English
    came to be used widely, both in the schools and the communica-
    tions media.
           The influence of English on the Chamorro language is very
    much like the influence of Spanish. Many words have been
    borrowed from English into Chamorro; but Chamorro grammar
    has not taken on any of the features of English grammar. Most
    of the borrowed words are names of newly introduced objects,
    such as ""washing machine, Jeep, lighter, pizza"" and so on.
    Occasionally one hears a complete English phrase in the middle
    of a Chamorro stream of speech. One that I have heard frequently
    is ""I mean . . . "" which is used, as in English, when one wishes to
    try to clarify something he has just said.
    English Loanblends. As was the case with Spanish, many English
    words have been made to conform to Chamorro grammar and
    pronunciation rules. These are cases of ""loanblends."" Some
    examples of these loanblends are bumoling (from ""bowling""),
    lumans (from ""lunch""), and mantataip (from ""type""). (For a
    more complete discussion of these loanblends and how they are
    made to conform to the Chamorro system, see Topping 1963b.)
    Influence of Foreign Languages on Chamorro Spelling. Of the
    various foreign language influences on the spelling of Chamorro,
    that of Spanish has been the greatest. Since the Spanish priests
    were the first to spell the Chamorro language, it is not surprising
    that they used their own alphabet. Considering the vast differ-
    ences in the two languages, the Spanish alphabet served surpris-
    ingly well and is still used today by many people who write
    Chamorro.
         German appears to have had some influence on the spelling
INTRODUCTION                                                                  9         of Chamorro. This can be seen in some writings where the letter
         k is used in place of Spanish c or qu, gw for gu, h for j, and j for
         y, as pronounced in the English word ""yes.""
              Since Japanese does not use the Roman alphabet for writing,
         it had no influence on the Chamorro writing system.
              The influence of English on everyday written Chamorro has
         not been very great. This is probably due to the fact that most
         people who can write English seldom have the need to write
         anything in Chamorro. The influence of English writing did play
         some part in the official Chamorro Orthography which was adopt-
         ed in Saipan in January, 1971. This is discussed in Section 2.8.1
         below.","[18, 19, 20, 21]"

Preface
This grammar of the Chamorro language has been in the planning
stage for a long time. Parts of the grammar were presented in my
doctoral dissertation in 1963. Additional pieces were published in
 1968. Many scattered fragments were incorporated in the foot-
notes of Spoken Chamorro (1969). But this is the first attempt on
my part to assemble enough pieces of the language in a sufficiently
systematic way to deserve to be called a reference grammar.
      There are, of course, other grammars of the Chamorro
language, some of which are fairly well known. I am indebted to
all of them for insights into the language which I was able to get
from studying them. I do not wish to claim that the present gram-
mar is any better than the earlier ones, but I would like to justify
its compilation (as an addition to the earlier ones) on three counts:
(1) it includes some data that the earlier grammars do not; (2) it
offers a different interpretation of some of the data based upon
more recent concepts in the field of linguistics; (3) it is written
primarily to help Chamorro speakers learn something of the
complexities of their language. It is hoped that interested non-
Chamorro speakers will also be able to learn something about the
language through studying this work.
      Because language is so complex and constantly changing, a
grammar can never be complete. There are usually exceptions to
every rule and new rules are constantly being made by the native
speakers of the language. This grammar is an attempt to describe
the rules of the language, not to prescribe them. All of the rules
given in this book are based on actual language used by numerous
native speakers of Chamorro throughout the Mariana Islands.
In addition to the rules, attempts are sometimes made to ""explain""
the rules—to give the reason for them. In most cases, however, no
explanation is offered simply because there is usually no reason
for any rule in any language.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

112               MORPHOLOGY:         WORDS AND THEIR           STRUCTUREDemonstratives3.4.2    In grammar books written for English one can find the terms
         ""demonstrative pronoun"" and ""demonstrative adjective"" used to
         refer to the words 'this, that, these, etc.' For Chamorro we can
         use the same term demonstrative to refer to the group of words
         that point out something specific.
              Chamorro has a three-way demonstrative system. The most
         commonly used words that form this system are:                 este 'this, close to speaker'
                 enao 'that, close to listener'
                 ayu 'that, away from speaker and listener'              Este 'this' was borrowed from Spanish, and has almost
         completely replaced the original Chamorro demonstrative which,
         according to Safford (41) was ayen ""if placed before the predi-
         cate,"" and yini or ini ""if placed after the predicate of a sentence.""
         Safford reported in 1903 that the Spanish loanword este was
         ""fast taking the place of ayen and ini."" While I have never heard
         these older Chamorro forms used in daily conversation, I have
         recorded ini in some folk tales as they were told by present-day
         Chamorro speakers. It is probably safe to conclude that the Span-
         ish demonstrative este is now used far more frequently than ini
         or yini and that ayen is not used at all.
              (Incidentally, ini occurs in modern Malay for 'this', and
         it parallels the modern Chamorro locative word guini in the same
         way that the demonstrative enao is related to the locative word
         guenao.)
              The word enao has an alternate form yenao which is some-
         times heard, especially in the speech of older persons or in folk
         tales. Although the word yenao does not occur in any of the texts
         on which this grammar is based, its occurrence in the language
         has been attested by several informants.
              The word ayu is frequently heard as eyu. While both ayu
         and eyu are currently in use, it is possible that eyu will ultimately
         replace ayu. If this happens, then all three of the demonstratives
         will share the common feature of beginning with the same sound
         e. This apparent change in the language that is taking place can
         be described as a sort of leveling, a process by which the three
         demonstratives will share a common feature.
               There is still another word yuhi that shares some of the same
         features as ayu and eyu. In some situations it may be used in place
MORPHOLOGY:      WORDS       AND THEIR          STRUCTURE                  113
       of ayu or eyu as a demonstrative. In other cases, it functions like
       a ""relative pronoun."" When yuhi is used as a demonstrative, it is
       understood that a prior reference to something has already been
       made or is understood, or that the feature of location is also
       included, as in 'that there'. Notice the following examples:                     a. Hu taitai ayu na lepblo.
                        'I read that book.'
                     b. Hu taitai yuhi na lepblo.
                        'I read that there book.'
                     c. Ayu na lepblo hu taitai.
                        'That book I read.'
              But not:
                     d. *Yuhi na lepblo hu taitai.
       Sentences a and b are not entirely synonymous. In sentence b
       the demonstrative yuhi suggests that the reference to ""that book""
       is more specific, visible, or that its existence is known to both the
       speaker and listener. A closer translation of yuhi in sentence b
       might be 'that there'. Sentence d is considered ungrammatical.
            In other situations ayu, eyu, and yuhi appear to be inter-
       changeable, as the following examples will show:              Para   ayu siha na mane'lu-hu i taotao i distritu kuatro.
                     eyu
                     yuhi
              'For those my brothers the people of the fourth district.'","[123, 124, 125]"

The alternate analysis in which ha would form part of the subject
N P would be as follows:
Either interpretation would be possible, but in both cases it seems
advisable to give ha a special designation. I have chosen to call
it a subject marker. When it occurs by itself, it should be con-
sidered a NP, as the following diagram will show:

       in Chamorro. Each of them involves a modifier and its relation-
       ship to its head (or nucleus). This aspect of Chamorro grammar
       is introduced at this time because many noun phrases include
       some type of modifier. Our discussion of modification will go
       beyond the noun phrase in order to provide an overview of the
       different types of modification in Chamorro.","[218, 219, 220]"
"PLURALIZATION
4.7    The C h a m o r r o grammar system shows the difference between
       plural and non-plural among the verbs, nouns, and pronouns,
       and in some cases the adjectives. Notice that the distinction made
       here is between plural and non-pural rather than between plural
       and singular. This is because Chamorro also distinguishes between
       dual and plural in the verb system.",[244]
"It will be noticed that there is no apparent relationship between
these two words meaning 'eat'. Neither form can be derived from
the other. Each of these words has become ""specialized"" in that
kanno' can only be used with definite objects while chocho can
only be used with indefinite objects. It will be further noted that
chocho requires the infix -um- that we have observed earlier in
the intransitive verbs.
    Type 3 probably includes only four verbs which are:

              malago'            Malago' yo' mansana.
              'to want'          'I want an apple.'
              maleffa            Maleffa yo' ni lepblo.
              'to forget'        'I forgot the book..'
              manotsot           Manotsot yo' ni isao.
              'to repent'        'I repent the sin.'
              munhayan           Munhayan yo' ni lepblo.
              'to finish'        'I finished the book.'
           In the case of transitive verbs of Type 3, the forms given
       above are the only existing forms and they are therefore used even
       when the object appears to be definite, e.g.,
              Malago' yo' ayu na lepblo.
              'I want that book.'
              Manotsot yo' ni bida-hu.
              'I repent what I did.'
       Irregular Verbs. The irregular verbs of Chamorro were introduced
       in the discussion of Class III words above. All of the irregular
       verbs belong to Class III. They are called irregular verbs because
       they do not conform to the patterns of affixation that the other
       verbs follow. Safford (1909:97 ff.) lists most of them as ""defective
       verbs."" In fact, even within Class III we find several different types
       of verbs when classified in terms of their grammatical features.
            The verbs that fall in this class of irregular verbs are listed
       here:
              gaige          'be, exist'
              guaha          'have, exist'
              taigue         'not present, absent'
              mangge         'where'
              taya'          'none'
              estaba         'used to be'
              gai            'have'
              tai            'none'
              munga          'don't, no'
              cha'—          'don't
              siña           'can'
              alok           'say'
              ga'o           'prefer'
              ya—            'like, prefer'
              malak          'go to'
        MORPHOLOGY:          WORDS AND THEIR                 STRUCTURE      mohon          'desire'

      iyo            'belong to'
The translations given in each case are close approximations.
These verbs will now be discussed separately.
    Gaige is probably the most common of the irregular verbs
in Chamorro. It is usually translated as 'there is' or 'there exists'
when the subject is specific:
      Gaige yo' gi eskuela.    'I am at school.'
      Gaige si Paul gi lancho.     'Paul is at the ranch.'
The verb can take the pluralizing prefix man-:
      Manggaige siha gi eskuela.       'They are at the school.'
It can also take reduplication:
      Gagaige si Paul gi eskuela.      'Paul is being at the school.'
The verb gaige cannot take any of the other verbal affixes. Note
that it is always followed immediately by the subject noun or
pronoun.
     Guaha is another very common word in Chamorro. It is
usually translated as 'have' or 'exist'. It differs from gaige in that
it does not take the standard verbal affixes, the sentence structure
that guaha requires is different, and the subject is relatively non-
specific. Note the following examples:
      Guaha salape'-hu.         'I have money.'
       exists money-my
      Guaha familia-ku.         'I have a family.'
       exists family-my
     The two sentences following will illustrate the difference in
use between gaige and guaha:
      Gaige i patgon giya Guam.
      The child is at Guam.'
      Guaha un patgon giya Guam.
      'There is a child at Guam.'
      Taigue might be considered the negative counterpart of
gaige. (Note also the positive-negative relationship between gai
and tai discussed below.) It is usually translated as 'it isn't there'
or 'it is absent':
MORPHOLOGY:      WORDS AND THEIR              STRUCTURE                  89              Taigue si Paul.
              'Paul isn't here (or there).'
              Taigue i estudiante.
              'The student is absent.'
       Like gaige, this verb can take the pluralizing prefix man- and can
       be reduplicated:
              Manaigue i manestudiante.
              'The students are absent.'
              Tataigue si Paul.
              'Paul is not being here.'
       Taigue does not take any of the other verbal affixes.
            Mangge is actually a contraction consisting of the question
       word manu 'where', the linking particle nai, and the irregular
       verb gaige. Thus, from the formal expression manu nai gaige we
       derive the informal contraction mangge 'where is'. Since the con-
       tracted form patterns itself very much like gaige and taigue, it is
       included here among the irregular verbs.
              Mangge si Paul?
              'Where is Paul?'
              Mangge hao?
              'Where are you?'
              Manmangge i famagu'on?
              Where are the children?'
            Taya' is the opposite (or negative) of guaha. It is usually
       translated as 'do not have' or 'does not exist', and it takes the
       same sentence structure as guaha. Examples are:
              Taya' salape'-hu.   'I don't have any money.'
                not exist money-my
              Taya' familia-ku.     'I don't have any family.'
                not exist family-my
            Estaba is a Spanish loan word from the verb estar. Since
       Chamorro does not have a formally marked past tense form for
       gaige, the Spanish loan word estaba is used in the sense of 'used to
       be' or 'was':
              Estaba yo' gi gualo' anai matto hao.
              'I was at the farm when you came.'
              Estaba bula kareta gi pantalan.
              'There used to be many cars at the pier.'
       MORPHOLOGY:            WORDS AND THEIR             STRUCTURE     Gai and tai are probably related to guaha and taya' respective-
ly. Gai has the same meaning as guaha, and tai means the same as
taya'. The difference is that gai and tai require different sentence
structures. Compare the following sentences with the ones above:
      Gai salape' yo'.          'I have money.'
      exists money me
      Tai salape' yo'.          'I don't have any money.'
      not exist money me
     A further difference is that gai and tai both take the plural
marking prefix man-, while guaha and taya' do not. Thus, the
following sentences are possible:
      Manggai salape' siha.       'They have money.'
      exists money they
      Mantai salape' siha.        'They don't have any money.'
      not exist money they
      NOTE: Some speakers might use the plural marking prefix
      man- with guaha and taya' to form mangguaha and mantaya'.
      These ""pluralized"" forms are not very common. Some speakers
      would not use them at all, but simply use the following forms:
      Guaha salape'-niha.         'They have money.'
      exists money-their
      Taya' salape'-niha.         'They don't have any money.'
      not exist money-their     Munga is a negative word that behaves more like a verb
than like anything else. That is why it is listed as one of the
irregular verbs. Munga is used most frequently in two somewhat
different ways. It is commonly used to decline something that is
offered, such as food or drink. A negative response to the question
Kao malago' hao chumochol (Would you like to eat?) would be
Munga yo'.
    Munga is also used in the sense of ""Don't do"" something:
      Munga gof atrasao.           'Don't be too late.'
      don't very late
      Munga manangga yo'.          'Don't wait for me.'
      don't wait for meThe irregular verb munga does not take any affixes.
      Cha'- is similar in meaning to munga, but it is quite a dif-
ferent sort of word. When used with the second person pronoun,
it carries the meaning 'don't':
MORPHOLOGY:      WORDS      AND THEIR          STRUCTURE                      91              Cha'-mu nanangga.
              Don't wait.'
        When used with other pronouns, it carries a somewhat different
        negative meaning, such as 'won't' or 'had better n o t ' :
              Cha'-hu nanangga.
              'I won't wait.'
              Cha'-na nanangga.
              'She had better not wait.'
              It will also be noted that the "" m a i n verb"" which occurs with
        clia'- is always in the reduplicated form.
              NOTE: The reduplicated form of nangga has been converted to
              a noun-like word, so that the sentence Cha'-mu nanangga might
              be translated as 'Don't be a waiter.' More will be said about
              this type of reduplication later.
             Siha 'can, may' is another of the irregular verbs that does not
        take affixation like the regular verbs. Sifia might be thought of as
        an auxiliary verb which functions very much like its English
        counterpart 'can.' It should be noticed that the subject pronoun
        patterns with sina rather than with the main verb. That is, if the
        ""main verb"" takes a specific object, then a /iw-type pronoun pre-
        cedes the verb. If the main verb is intransitive, or takes a non-
        specific object, a j o ' - t y p e pronoun usually follows sifia, but may
        also follow the main verb. See the following examples:
              Sina yo' manli'e' palao'an?
              'I can see a woman.'
              Sina hu Ii'e' i palao'an?
              'I can see the woman.'
              Sina yo' gumupu.
              'I can fly.'
              Sina gumupu yo'.
              'I can fly.'
             The next three irregular verbs—alok, ga'o- and ya—all have
        at least one thing in c o m m o n : they must take possessive subject
        pronouns in non-future constructions. The examples cited below
        are given with the first person singular subject p r o n o u n :
              Ilek-hu ""no"".
              '1 said ""no"".'
              Ga'o-ku guihan.
              'I prefer fish.'
              Ya-hu guihan.
              'I like fish.'
        MORPHOLOGY:            WORDS AND THEIR          STRUCTURE     There are further peculiarities of two of these irregular verbs
that should be mentioned at this time.
     The verb alok has the alternate form ilek when it occurs in
the non-future tense. The form alok occurs in future tense (Para
bai hu alok ""no"". 'I will say ""no"".') Alok is the only one of these
three verbs that can occur in the future tense. Note that when alok
occurs, a different type of subject pronoun must be used.
     The verb ga'o 'prefer' has an alternate form ga'ha. Both are
used freely with precisely the same meaning:
      Ga'o-ku guihan.
      'I prefer fish.'
      Ga'iia-ku guihan.
      'I prefer fish.'
     The irregular verb malak 'go to' stands alone in terms of the
syntactic patterns that it requires. Unlike all of the other verbs,
regular and irregular, it cannot take a subject pronoun immedi-
ately before or after. It appears to have a kind of ""built in""
preposition, and the subject pronoun must follow the location, as
in the following examples:
      Malak Honolulu yo'.
      'I went to Honolulu.'
      Malak i tenda yo'.
      'I went to the store.'
     The initial m of malak changes to f in future and imperative
statements.
      Para bai hu falak i tenda.
      'I will go to the store.'
      Falak i tenda.
      'Go to the store.'
    Malak is also used to form sentences with certain location
words, as in the following examples:
      Malak papa' yo'.
      'I went down.'
      Malak tatte yo'.
      'I went behind.'
      Falak i me'nan i palao'an.
      'Go in front of the woman.'","[98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104]"
"
T H E N O U N PHRASE4.1      The noun phrase (NP) is probably a basic grammatical unit in all
         languages. The term noun phrase is used to define a structure that
         contains a noun or nounlike word as a nucleus. The nucleus may
         be considered the ""center"" or the ""headword"" of the NP. The
         headword may or may not have attributes or modifiers.
              (The various terms such as nucleus, center, headword,
         attribute, and modifier are all used by various linguists. In this
         discussion of the N P we will use the terms headword for ""nucleus""
         and modifier for ""attribute."")
              The N P in Chamorro may consist of any of the following:                          ""Emphatic Pronoun

Classifiers
3.5.0         Many of the languages of Asia and the Pacific area have a gram-
              matical feature generally known as classifiers. In a language with
              a fully operative classifier system each concrete noun belongs to
              a certain class and is marked by the use of that classifier. In a
              language such as Trukese this system of classifiers is found in the
              counting system and the possessives.
                    The Chamorro system of classifiers was probably much more
              elaborate in the past than it is now. The system of counting
              described by Safford (1909: 47-50) and by Costenoble (1940:
              259-265) suggests that Chamorro once had a system of classifying
              nouns that has been lost. Only vestiges of the classifier system are
              still in use.
                    In modern Chamorro the classifiers are used in possessive
              constructions only. The classifiers and the categories they mark
              are as follows:
                    na'          'edible things'
                    ga'          'non-human animals'
                    iyo          'inanimate objects'
                    gimen        'drinkable things'
              Of the four classifiers, the first three are commonly used. The last
              one, gimen, is frequently omitted. Iyo is used metaphorically
              with human objects, as in Iyo-ku hao, 'You belong to me.'
                   Following are some examples showing the use of the Cha-
              morro classifiers:

              'I have a fish to eat.'
              Guaha dos mannok na'-na.
              'He has two chickens to eat.'
            Guaha na'-hu nenkanno'.
            'I have food.'      ga'
            Guaha ga'-hu guihan.
            'I have a (pet) fish.'
            Malingu i ga'-na ga'lagu.
            'His dog was lost.'
            I patgon estaba humugagandu gi kanton tasi yan i ga'-na
              haguihi.
            'The child was playing at the beach with his crab.'
            NOTE: The word ga'lagu 'dog' is a compound word made up of
            the morphemes ga' 'animal classifier' and lagu 'north'. Literally
            translated ga'lagu means 'animal from the north', which suggests
            that it was introduced by a foreign group.
           The classifier ga' is also used with verbs to mean 'one who
      loves to' do something, as in the following examples. (Primary
      stress usually falls on ga'-.)
            ga' + kuentos       'talk'   —» ga'kumuentos
                                            'talker'
            ga' + gimen         'drink' —> ga'gumimen
                                           'drinker' or 'a drunk'
            ga' + taitai        'read'   —> ga'manaitai
                                            'one who reads (or prays) a lot'
            ga' + e + palao'an           -»   ga'umepalao'an
                                              'woman chaser'
      tyo
            Estaba guaha iyo-ku Evinrude.
            'I used to have an Evinrude.'
            Guaha iyo-na kareta si Pedro.
            'Pedro has a car.'
            Guaha iyon-niha kareta i famalao'an.
            'The women have a car.'
      In the last three sentences above the use of the classifier iyo could
      have easily been avoided by phrasing the statements differently.

Articles3.4.6      There is a set of ""little"" words in Chamorro that will be called
           articles. Even though they are little (or small) words, they form a
           very important part of the grammar of Chamorro. In some cases
           they seem similar to the articles in English, but in many cases the
           use of the Chamorro articles is unique to Chamorro, and have no
           parallel to the use of articles in English or Spanish.
                 There are some Spanish articles used in Modern Chamorro,
           but their use is very limited. We will first look at the Chamorro
           articles and then take a brief look at the few Spanish loan articles.
                 The Chamorro articles can be subclassed into two types.
           There are common articles and proper articles. The proper articles
           are used with proper names of people or places; the common
           articles are used elsewhere. It should be remembered that the
           Chamorro articles can not always be translated into English.
                 The proper articles in Chamorro are si, as, and iya. Articles
           si and as are used with names of people; iya is used with names of
           places. Notice the use of the articles in the following examples:           Si                 Si Juan.                 'Juan.'
                 Si Nana.                 'Mother.'
                 Si Maga'lahi.            'The Governor.'
                 Si Yu'us.                'God.'
                 Mangge si Rita?          'Where is Rita?'
                 Si Ben yo'.              'I am Ben.'
                 Si Juan ha chiku         'Juan kissed Maria.'
                    si Maria.",[142]

"Spanish Articles. The Spanish articles that are found in modern
C h a m o r r o are un, la, and las. They are very limited in their use
and usually occur in fixed idiomatic expressions.
      The article un is used with countable nouns when the noun
is both indefinite and singular. It is used when the speaker wishes
to emphasize the ""oneness"" of the noun. In some cases it might
be translated as ' o n e ' :
      Un lahi humanao.
      'A man went' or 'one man went.'

"C H A M O R R O C I Z E D SPANISH2.9       Perhaps it should be mentioned again that C h a m o r r o is not a
          dialect of Spanish. N o r is it a creolized version of Spanish. Like
          several of the languages of the Philippines and South America,
          Chamorro contains many words of Spanish origin which were
          borrowed over a period of more than 250 years.
               When these Spanish words were borrowed, the pronuncia-
          tion of them was usually changed to conform to the sound system
          of Chamorro. The most important of these sound changes are
          given here.
               The following examples illustrate sound changes that were
          very regular as words were borrowed from Spanish into Chamor-

          •Sometimes the final-d in Spanish words was simply not pronounced when
          used by Chamorro speakers, e.g., Siuda.
                         THE SOUND     SYSTEM     OF    CHAMORRO
The sound changes listed above show the result of what happens
when a word is borrowed from one language into another and
when the sound systems of the two languages are different from
each other. In the examples listed above, Chamorro made the
Spanish words conform to the Chamorro sound system. In some
cases, Chamorro simply did not have the sound (i.e., v, -11-, -rr-);
in other cases, Chamorro had the sound, but the distributional
limitations were different (i.e. final -1, -r and -d).
      The sound changes listed above were highly regular. In addi-
tion to those, there were some irregular sound changes. They are
called irregular because the sound change has proved to be in-
consistent, and therefore unpredictable. They involve the sounds
1, r, and h.
      In some instances, Spanish r became Chamorro r or was
omitted entirely. For example:
      Spanish            Chamorro      franela        franela—flanela
In other instances, Spanish r became Chamorro 1:
      frito     aflitu
And, in a few instances, Chamorro added h where there was none
in Spanish:
     espia       espiha
     For the most part, the sound changes that occurred when
Spanish words were borrowed into Chamorro were very regular.
Hence, when we hear a Chamorro word that is Spanish in origin,
we can usually reconstruct the original Spanish word accurately
simply by following the rules of sound changes listed above.
     Following are some Chamorrocized Spanish words with the
original Spanish words from which they came. See if you can
describe the sound changes that took place in each word.

    Of course, there are always cases of sound change that don't
THE SOUND SYSTEM      OF   CHAMORRO                                  69       appear to follow the regular rules. Such examples are often found
       in words that occur very often. This high frequency of occurrence
       may cause the sounds in the word to undergo further change. An
       example of such a word in Chamorro is Yu'us from Spanish Dios
       meaning 'God'.
3     Morphology:
      Words and Their Structure      In this section we will give close attention to the morphology
      of Chamorro—the stock of morphemes and the way words
      (sometimes phrases) are built out of them. Before proceding any
      further it will first be necessary to define and illustrate some of the
      new terms that will be used frequently throughout this section.
      Traditional grammatical terminology will be used where appro-
      priate. But since Chamorro is such a different language from
      those of western Europe where the ""traditional"" terms were
      coined, it will be necessary from time to time to use new terms
      that are more appropriate for Chamorro.
           It should be pointed out that it is not always possible to draw
      a clear line marking the boundary of words and syntax, or gram-
      mar. This is especially true of Chamorro where a large portion
      of the syntax is found in the formation of words. Every effort
      will be made to keep the discussion of syntax to a minimum in
      this section of the book. The reader should not be surprised,
      however, to find some overlapping between this section and the
      following one on syntax.","[79, 80, 81, 82]"
"             E x a m p l e s of each of these types of affixes will be presented and
             discussed below.
                    It should be pointed o u t t h a t the classification of C h a m o r r o
             affixes into o n e of these t w o classes is sometimes a r b i t r a r y . In
             s o m e instances it is not entirely clear whether an affix is m o r e like
             a derivational affix o r an inflectional affix. This lack of precision
             simply emphasizes the fact t h a t language d o e s not always lend
             itself t o a division into neat little categories.
MORPHOLOGY:      WORDS AND THEIR               STRUCTURE               175       Derivational Affixes. Listed below in alphabetical order are some
       of the derivational affixes of Chamorro. The names that have been
       chosen for them are arbitrary. Whenever possible the author has
       used traditional terminology. In some cases the prefix is given a
       name; in other cases a translation seems more appropriate.
            Some of the affixes are more productive than others: that is
       to say, some affixes can be easily combined with new stems to
       form new words. Most of the affixes listed here are still very
       productive. There is no doubt that some affixes which were for-
       merly productive have now become fossilized in a few words.
       For example, there is an obvious relationship between papa
       'wing' and palapa 'to flap wings', but the meaning of -la- (if there
       ever was one) has been lost. We find it in a few other words such
       as chalaochao (from chaochao) 'shake, rattle,' kalaskas (from
       kaskas) 'rustling sound,' and palangpang (from pangpang) 'ex-
       plosion.' Even in these words the meaning of the affix -la- is not
       clear.       a- Reciprocal Prefix. This prefix is always attached to a verb.
       It means 'to each other'. It may occur with other affixes, and it
       carries primary stress.","[186, 187]"
"       Notes on the sentences: Huyong changes to hiyong, mo'na to
       me'na, and hulo' to hilo' following gi. This change is explained by
       the vowel harmony rule (cf. 2.7.3). The final n of tatte and me'na
       (sentences d and f ) is an excrescent consonant (cf. 2.6.2). It
       occurs when either tatte or mo'na is followed by a noun phrase.
            The location words (with the exception of hulo') can also
       form predicates of sentences by simply adding the affix -um- or
       man- and a subject. In most cases the meaning is predictable.
       There are, however, some special meanings for some of the affixed
       forms. In the examples below notice the relationship of the glosses
       given for the word given in isolation and in the sentences:
              a. halom 'inside'       Humalom gue' gi         'He went inside
                                        gima'.                  the house.'
                                      Manhalom siha gi        'They went inside
                                       gima'.                   the house.'
              b.   huyong   'outside' Humuyong gue' gi        'He went out of
                                       gima'.                   the house.'
                                      Manhuyong siha gi       'They went out of
                                        gima'.                  the house.
              c. papa'      'down,    Pumapa' sasatge gue'.   'He is going under
                            under'                              the floor.'
              d. tatte      'behind' Tumatatte gue'magi.      'He is coming here
                                                                later.'
              e.    fi'on   'next to' Fumifi'on gue' gi       'He is nearing the
                                        gima'.                  house.'
              f. fo'na      'ahead'   Fumofo'na gue'.           'He is going
                                                                ahead.'

       MORPHOLOGY:          WORDS       AND THEIR        STRUCTURE     The word hulo' is not included in the above list because it is
irregular. In order to form a sentence with hulo' as the predicate,
it is necessary to add the directional prefix ka- to get kahulo'
'to go up'. The infix -um- can then be added to this stem to form
a predicate.
      Kumahulo' gue' gi ekso'. 'He went up the hill.'
      (NOTE: The directional prefix ka- found in the stem kahulo'
      is no longer productive. It is found in the word kama'gas 'to
      become a boss' from ma'gas 'boss', and perhaps in some other
      uncommon words. In view of the limited use of the prefix ka-,
      an alternative analysis of kahulo' is to consider it as a single
      morpheme which is related somehow to hulo'. Chamorro has
      several 'directional particles' similar to ka- which will be dis-
      cussed later.)
     It should also be noted that the word hulo' can take the
infix -um- in the expression Humulo'papa' yo' 'I went up and
down.' In this case the two words hulo' and papa' have come to-
gether to form a compound word hulo'papa'. This compound
word can take the infix -um- to form a predicate. The word hulo'
by itself requires the prefix ka- when it forms a predicate.
     There are two words in C h a m o r r o whose translations might
suggest that they be considered location words. They are hihot
'near' and chago' 'far'. They are similar to the location words
discussed above, since they can take the infix -um- and function
as the predicate of a sentence:
     Humihot yo' gi gima'. 'I was near the house.'
     C h u m a g o ' yo' gi gima'. 'I was far from the house.'
However, unlike the other location words, hihot and chago'
cannot form a locative phrase with the preposition gi. Note the
following examples:
          Gaige yo' gi halom guma'.
          'I am in the house.'
          Gaige yo' gi hiyong guma'.
          'I am outside the house.'
          Gaige yo' gi papa' guma'.
          'I am under the house.'
           Gaige yo' gi fi'on guma'.
           'I am next to the house.'
      But not:
          *Gaige yo' gi hihot guma'.
           for 'I am near the house.'

"The prefix ga'- is used less often than the infixes or reduplication,
and it is used more frequently with some verbs than with others.
For example, from kuentos 'talk' we get ga'kumuentos 'one who
talks a lot'; and from maigo' 'to sleep' we get ga'maigo' 'sleepy-
head'.
     Intransitive verbs such as gupu 'to fly' can also be changed to
words that function like nouns by some of the same affixes.
      Infix:              Hu li'e' i gumupu.
                          'I saw the one who flew.'

                                 'I saw the flyer.'
              (NOTE: As the result of certain morphophonemic processes
              and sound changes, the reduplicated form gigipu often comes
              out as gekpo, with the same meaning. This difference in forms can
              be explained as follows. The second vowel of gigipu was lost; the
              result of this loss is *gigpu. Since the first vowel is now in a
              closed syllable (gig-), it is lowered to e (cf. 2.7.3 and 2.7.4).
              Now that the first vowel is the mid vowel e and is followed by two
              consonants and a vowel, the second vowel is lowered to o. At
              this stage the word is *gegpo. Since voiced stops do not occur at
              the end of a syllable, g changes to k and we end up with the
              form gekpo. This process is very common in Chamorro and can
              be traced in scores of words.)       Verb to Modifier. Verbs can also be changed to modifiers through
       the process of reduplication, as in the following examples:
              Reduplication: i hahatsa na taotao
                             'the lifting person'
                                i gigipu na paluma
                                'the flying bird'            Another way of converting a verb to a modifier is by adding
       the suffix -on, which might be compared to the English suffix
       '-able', as in 'lovable.' The Chamorro suffix has an allomorph
       -yon which occurs when the stem ends with a vowel. Some
       examples of this suffix are:              Verb                     Modifier
              atan 'look at'           atanon 'nice to look at' (lit. look
                                         at-able')
              sangan 'to tell'         sanganon 'tellable'
              guaiya 'to love'         guaiyayon 'lovable'
              tulaika 'exchange'       tulaikayon 'exchangable'
       Notice that the primary stress always shifts to the next to final
       syllable when this suffix is added.
       Noun to Verb. Frequently nouns are changed to verb-like words
       through the use of the infix -um-. This can be illustrated in the
       following examples:
              Infix:   Humanom i leche. (from hanom 'water')
                       'The milk became water.'
                       Tumaotao i patgon. (from taotao 'person')
                       'The child became a person.'
        MORPHOLOGY:                WORDS   AND THEIR    STRUCTURENoun to Modifier. Nouns can be converted to modifiers by the use
of certain prefixes and infixes, as the following examples will show:
      Infix:   Hinanom i leche. (hanom plus -in-)
               'The milk is watery.'
               Kinahet i kolot. (kahet plus -in-)
               'The color is orangeish.'
      Prefix: Mihaga' i litratu. (mi- plus haga')
              'The picture was bloody.'
               Mipilu i lahi. (mi- plus pulu)
               'The man is hairy.'
      NOTE: Both mihaga' and mipilu have alternate forms which
      are mehga' and mepplo respectively. The formation of these
      shorter words is very much like the formation of gekpo from
     gigipu (described above). In the case of mehga' from mihaga',
      the second vowel was lost, thereby producing mihga'. Since the
      first syllable became closed, the first vowel was lowered from
     j_to e. The result was then mehga'. Can you describe the process
      whereby mipilu became mepplo1.
Modifier to Verb. Modifiers can be converted to words that function
like verbs by the addition of the infix -um-. For example:
      Infix:   Dumankolo i palao'an.
               'The woman became big.'
               Dumikike' i guihan.
               'The fish became small.'
               Uma'paka' i bihu.
               'The old man became white.'
Modifier to Noun. Modifiers can function as noun-like words
even without affixation. The position in the sentence and the use
of the article i are sufficient.
      Hu tungo' i dankolo.
      'I know the big (one).'
      Hu li'e' i agaga'.
      'I saw the red (one).'
      Hu guaiya i dikike'.
      'I like the little (one).'
    Modifiers may also be converted to noun-like words through
adding the infix -in-. Look at the contrasting phrases that follow:
               i baba na taotao
               'the bad man'
MORPHOLOGY:        WORDS AND THEIR              STRUCTURE                    105
               Infix:   i binaban taotao
                        'the man's badness'
              Some words from the minor class (which are discussed in
         section 3.4.) can also change classes as a result of the processes
         described above. Two examples will illustrate how this happens:
               Location word tatte 'behind'
               With infix -um-: Tumatte yo'. 'I went behind.'
               Reduplication: tatatte 'progeny, one left behind'               Location word halom 'inside'
               With infix -um-: Humalom yo'. 'I went inside.'
               With prefix mi- and infix -in-: mihinalom 'intelligence'               NOTE: The last word in the above example—mihinalom—is
               often pronounced mehnalom. Can this be explained according to
               processes that have been observed in other words?
              In addition there are a fairly large number of verbs bor-
         rowed from Spanish which are converted to nouns by the same
         process that operates in Spanish. This process can be demon-
         strated by comparing the Spanish and Chamorro below:               Spanish      aliviar 'to relieve' becomes alivio 'relief'
               Chamorro     alibia 'to relieve' becomes alibiu 'relief'             As can be seen from the preceding discussion, it is very com-
         mon for words to change classes in Chamorro. This is one reason
         why it is difficult to claim that a particular word in Chamorro
         belongs to a particular part of speech or class. And this is the
         major reason why we chose to establish the major classes of words
         in Chamorro as Class I, II, and III.","[114, 115, 116, 117]"

      velum The back of the roof of the mouth; the rear of the soft palate
           used in making the velar sounds k, g, and ng.

   verbalizer An affix that has the effect of changing a nonverb to a
       word that functions like a verb. For example, when the verbalizer

   voiceless     Sounds produced without vibration of the vocal cords.
   vowel fronting The process whereby a back vowel is changed to a
       front vowel as a result of the vowel harmony rules.
   vowel harmony The process whereby vowels change in their phonetic
       quality to become more like a preceding vowel. For example,
       the vowel u in guma' changes to i when the word guma' is preceded
       by the article /, as in igima'.
   vowel lowering The process whereby a high vowel becomes a mid
       vowel as a result of changing an open syllable to a closed syllable,
       usually through suffixation.
   vowel raising The process whereby a mid vowel becomes a high
       vowel as a result of changing a closed syllable to an open syllable,
       usually through suffixation.

Allomorphs
3.2.1    In Section 2.1.2, which forms part of the discussion of the sound
         system of Chamorro, the term allophone was explained as ""phone-
         tic variants"" of a single phoneme. In a manner quite parallel to
         the phoneme-allophone relationship, we also find a morpheme-
         allomorph relationship. An allomorph is a variant of a morpheme
         occurring in a specific environment. In other words, the same
         morpheme may be pronounced differently depending on the
         immediate environment.
              It is important not to confuse allomorphs with the different
         pronunciations that result from rapid speech or from contrac-
MORPHOLOGY:      WORDS AND THEIR              STRUCTURE                       75       tions. In English, for example, didn't is a contracted form of
       did not, but it is not an allomorph. In Chamorro, pon is frequently
       used as a contracted form of para un (as in Para un cho'gue),
       but it is not an allomorph.
             Allomorphs are different forms of a single morpheme and
       the differences in form are determined by their immediate en-
       vironment. Some examples from English and Chamorro will
       help to illustrate this concept.
             In English, the morpheme that signifies past tense is written
       -ed. The pronunciation of this morpheme will vary, depending on
       the pronunciation of the word to which it is attached. The past
       tense of the verb walk is walked, pronounced /wokt/. The final
       -ed in this case is pronounced /t/. The past tense of the verb move
       is moved, pronounced /muvd/. The final -ed in this case is pro-
       nounced /d/. And the past tense of the verb treat is treated,
       pronounced /tritad/. The final -ed in this case is pronounced /ad/.
             The above examples illustrate that there are at least three
       allomorphs of the past tense verb ending in English. (There are
       actually more, but these are the most common ones.) They are
       /t/, /d/, and /ad/. The environments for these three allomorphs
       can be easily stated:              1. If the stem ends with /t/ or /d/, the allomorph /ad/ will occur.
              2. If the stem ends with any voiceless consonant except /t/, the
              allomorph /t/ will occur.
              3. The allomorph /d/ occurs elsewhere.","[86, 87]"
"     The Spanish prepositions that cannot be used freely in com-
bination with Chamorro words will be called G r o u p II preposi-
tions. The most common prepositions of this group are as follows:      di           (Sp. de)
      kon          (Sp. con)     The preposition di is used very often in Chamorro speech. In
the majority of cases it is used in fixed idiomatic expressions that
are of Spanish origin. Most of these expressions function more
like conjunctions and subordinators, and will be discussed under
those headings. For some examples of di as a preposition, or 'pre-
position like', see the following:

              Sigi hao di mama'baba fan ta'lo.
              'You are continuing to fool around again.'
              Humanao gue' en lugat di guahu.
              'He went instead of me.'","[140, 141]"

T H E C H A M O R R O L A N G U A G E : ITS ORIGINS, RELATIVES, A N D
TENACITY
1.2      The origins of the Chamorro language are very nearly as obscure
         as the origins of the people. Since there are no written records
INTRODUCTION                                                               3       before the work of Father Sanvitores in 1668, we have no way to
       ascertain what the language was like when the first people came to
       the Marianas. Even the records left by Father Sanvitores, which
       constitute one of the earliest grammars of any Pacific language,
       are too sketchy to give a very clear picture of what the language
       was like in his day. Hence, we can not be certain as to what the
       language of the original Chamorro settlers was like. We can only
       speculate, with perhaps some help from current comparative
       evidence. At least one scholar of comparative languages in the
       Pacific area claims that the closest relatives to Chamorro are
       Maanyan (of Borneo) and West Futuna, in the New Hebrides
       (Dyen 1962:43). His claims are based upon the relatively high
       percentage of common vocabulary items that are shared among
       these languages.
             Chamorro belongs to the family of languages known as
       Austronesian. My own opinion is that Chamorro is a Philippine
        type language, and its closest linguistic relatives are probably
        Ilokano and Tagalog. This opinion is based on the many similari-
       ties in the grammatical structures of the languages and, in par-
       ticular, the focus system of the languages. (More will be said
       about this later in the section on grammar.) It is quite possible
       that these similarities in the grammatical devices were borrowed
       from Filipinos with whom the Chamorros traded. However, this
       is very unlikely. Speakers of one language often borrow words
       from another language, but very seldom, if ever, do they
       borrow grammatical features.
             We will leave the question of when and how the Chamorro
       language first became a separate language to those who are more
       interested in reconstructing history. The important thing for
       modern students of Chamorro—both native speakers and
       others—to bear in mind is that Chamorro is not a dialect of any
       other known language. It is a separate and distinct language in
       itself, just as German, Japanese, and English are separate and
       distinct languages. There are dialects of Chamorro, namely the
       dialects of central Guam, southern Guam, Rota, and Saipan.
       But these dialects simply reflect slightly different ways of speaking
       the same language —Chamorro. As we will see, Chamorro has all
       of the regular rules and complexities that are found in all langu-
       ages of the world. Some of the rules for Chamorro are similar to
       rules found in related languages. But most of them are distinctly
       Chamorro.
             One very remarkable thing about the history of the Chamor-
4                                                          INTRODUCTION        ro language is its ability to survive. In spite of the drastic reduction
        in population during Spanish times to an estimated 3,678 speak-
        ers (Thompson 1947:57), the language survived. In spite of
        intensive efforts by Spanish and American administrative au-
        thorities to "" s t a m p o u t "" Chamorro, the language survived. In
        spite of the current ""Americanization"" of the Marianas, com-
        plete with mass communications and education in English, the
        language is still surviving. I, for one, hope that it will continue to
        survive.
             There are those who maintain that the C h a m o r r o language
        is dying out. There are even those who are anxious to hasten its
        death. If such is indeed the case, let us hope that something can
        be done to stop this trend. C h a m o r r o is the native language of
        the Chamorro people. It forms a very critical part of their social
        and personal vitality. It is the language they use to communicate
        their most intimate thoughts to their God and their loved ones.
        It is the language they use for fun by playing with both the
        sounds and meanings of words. It is the language they use to
        create dreams and fantasies and for secret thoughts. F o r the
        Chamorro people to lose this language would be a great loss
        indeed, one that could never be replaced.
              I am hopeful that the Chamorro language will continue to
        survive. People without a language are poor people indeed. I
        hope, too, that this grammar may contribute in some small way
        to its survival.","[14, 15, 16]"
"      Finally, gi is used with all location words to form a preposi-
tional phrase. In the previous section we used the term locative
phrase for phrases which included the preposition gi plus location
words. When any phrase is introduced by a preposition, we may
also use the term prepositional phrase. Some examples of pre-
positional (and locative) phrases are given here:      I Iepblo gaige gi hilo' i lamasa.
      'The book is on top of the table.'
      I lepblo gaige gi papa' i lamasa.
      'The book is under the table.'
      I lepblo gaige gi fi'on i lapes.
      'The book is next to the pencil.'
MORPHOLOGY:      WORDS AND THEIR              STRUCTURE                121
              I salape' gaige gi halom i lepblo.
              'The money is in the book.'
              I salape' gaige gi sanhalom i balakbak.
              'The money is inside the purse.'
             As stated earlier, the preposition gi carries a very heavy
       functional load in Chamorro. It covers the range of meaning of
       several English prepositions, and in some instances it is simply
       not possible to translate gi.
             Another Chamorro preposition, more restricted in usage,
       is giya. It is used only with names of places and with the emphatic
       pronouns. The place name may be a proper noun—such as Guam,
       Saipan, Merizo—or it may be one of the emphatic pronouns,
       hami 'we, exclusive'. (Cf. 3.4.1.) When giya is used with the
       pronoun hami, it means 'at my house'; when used with hamyo
       it means 'at your house;' when used with any of the other em-
       phatic pronouns, it means 'belonging to', 'to', 'from', or some
       other related meaning. Examples showing the use of giya are
       given here:
              Sumasaga yo' giya Agana.
              'I live in Agana.'
              Manmatto siha giya Saipan.
              'They came to Saipan.'
              Hu li'e' gue' giya Toto.
              'I saw him at Toto.'
              Machocho'cho' gue' giya sanlagu.*
              'He works in the United States.'
              Gaige gue' giya hami.
              'He is at my house.'","[132, 133]"
"       It might be possible to translate the above sentences as 'What
       is your want?' and 'What was his thing-seen?' and so forth.
       This would preserve the possessive nature of the pronoun, but it
       would give us very clumsy translations. It seems preferable to
       say that the possessive pronouns also function as subject pro-
       nouns under certain conditions.
            The possessive pronouns have another special function when
       they occur with location words. In this situation they seem to
       function as a kind of object of the location word, similar to an
       object of a preposition in English. The examples below will
       illustrate this special function:
              hulo'    'above'        i hilo'-mami    'above us'
              mo'na    'in front'     i me'nan-niha   'in front of them'
              tatte    'behind'       i tatte-ku      'behind me'
              fi'on    'near'         i fi'on-mu      'near you'
              agapa'   'right side'   i agapa'-na     'to the right of him'
              akague   'left side'    i akague-na     'to the left of him'
       MORPHOLOGY:              WORDS     AND THEIR         STRUCTURE      There is another important morphophonemic change in the
first person singular possessive pronoun. We have given the base
form of this pronoun as -hu. It also occurs as -su, -tu, and -ku
under the following conditions:      1. If the stem has a final s, the form of the pronoun is -su:
     lassas 'skin;' lassas-su 'my skin.'
     2. If the stem has a final t, the form of the pronoun is -tu: pachot
     'mouth;' pachot-tu 'my mouth.'
     3. If the stem has a medial consonant cluster, then the form of
     the pronoun is -ku: lepblo 'book;' lepbld-ku 'my book'.
     Under all other conditions, the form of the pronoun is -hu.
     For purposes of writing, only -hu and -ku will be written.
     The last set of pronouns to be discussed are the emphatic
pronouns. They usually function as subject pronouns and are used
in situations where the subject is emphasized. The full set of
emphatic pronouns is given here:
                    1st           guahu      T
     Singular       2nd           hagu      'you'
                    3rd           guiya     'he, she, it'                    1st incl.     hita      'we inclusive'
                    1st excl.     hami      'we exclusive'
      Plural        2nd           hamyo     'you—2 or more'
                    3rd           siha      'they—2 or more'
    Some examples of the emphatic pronouns as subject pro-
nouns are:
      Guahu Iumi'e' i palao'an.
      'I am the one who saw the woman.'
      Guiya humatsa i Iamasa.
      'He is the one who lifted the table.'
      NOTE: When the emphatic pronouns are used as subject pro-
      nouns, the verb must take a special affix. In the above examples
      the affix is -um-. This is part of the focus system of Chamorro
      which will be discussed in section 4.10 below.
    The emphatic pronouns may also be found in other types of
contructions where they should not be described as subject
pronouns. For example, in answer to the question Hayi chumo'-
gue? ' W h o did it?', one could say Guiya 'Him.'
     The emphatic pronouns are also found in such expressions
as guatu giya guiya 'towards him'. In addition, the emphatic
pronouns are used very commonly to mean 'at someone's house'

        as in giya hami 'at o u r house' or giya hamyo ' a t y o u r place'. T h e y
        m a y also occur as emphasized object p r o n o u n s in transitive

"TYPES OF MORPHEMES AND WORDS
3.2    Under the general heading of morpheme come several types.
       Since it will be necessary to make frequent references to them
       during the discussion of the grammar, the various types of mor-
       phemes found in Chamorro will be presented here.
              Free morphemes are morphemes which can stand alone with-
       out any other morphemes attached to them. They are always
       words, and they cannot be reduced to any smaller forms. Some
       examples of free morphemes are / 'the', dankolo 'big', hatsa 'to
       lift', li'e' 'to see', and pachot 'mouth'.
              Bound morphemes can never stand alone, but must always be
       attached to another morpheme to form a word. Some examples
       of bound morphemes are e- as in epanglao 'look for crabs', -um-
       as in sumasaga 'be staying', and -naihon as in saganhaihon 'stay
       for a while'. Bound morphemes cannot be considered as words,
       but they serve to form complex words. (See below for discussion
       of complex words.)
              With these two categories of morphemes we can form three
       different types of words. The first type of word will be called
74              MORPHOLOGY:          WORDS AND THEIR            STRUCTURE         simple words. They are equal to the free morphemes described
         above. They may also be considered roots or root words.
              The second type of word will be called compound words
         which are composed of two (possibly more) free morphemes.
         Some examples of compound words are halomtano' 'forest',
         guma'yu'os 'church', and tronkonhayu 'tree'. It is often difficult to
         determine whether the Chamorro compound words should be
         treated as single words or as phrases consisting of two words.
         (This is often a problem in English as well.) For example, are terms
         such as batkon aire 'airplane' a compound word or a noun
         phrase? Or what about botsan alunan 'pillow case'? Is halomtano'
         a compound word or a series of two words? The question can
         best be resolved by the intuitive feelings of the native speaker.
              The third type of word is the complex word, and except for
         simple words, it is probably the most common type of word
         found in Chamorro. The complex word consists of either a free
         morpheme plus one or more bound morphemes, or, on rare oc-
         casions, two bound morphemes. Some examples of complex
         words consisting of free and bound morphemes are apasi 'to
         pay' (from apas plus -i), fa'maolek 'fix' (from fa'- plus maolek),
         and hinasso 'thought' (from hasso plus -in-). An example of a
         complex word consisting of two bound morphemes is na'i 'to
         give' (from na'- plus -/').
              In many cases the bound morpheme of complex words has
         become ""fossilized"" so that native speakers tend to think of the
         word as an indivisible unit. A word such as ekungok 'to listen'
         probably comes from the bound morpheme e-plus hungok 'to
         hear'; the word tattiyi 'follow' probably comes from the free
         morpheme tatte 'follow' plus the bound morpheme -yi.","[85, 86]"

       dual (referring to ""we two"") or plural (referring to three or
       more). Plurality as opposed to duality is indicated by the form
       of the verb used with the pronoun. This will be discussed later.
          The second set of pronouns are called yo'-type pronouns. The
       name of this set comes from the first person singular form which
       is yo'. (The pronoun yo' was in all probability borrowed from
       Spanish. It is the only ""non-native"" pronoun in the language.)
       The complete set of the yo '-type pronouns is as follows:                               1st            yo'         'I, me'

"       Reduplication. In addition to the reduplication described under
       Derivational Affixes, there is another kind of reduplication that
       belongs under the heading of Inflectional Affix. The rules for its
       formation are basically the same as those given for the nominaliz-
       ing reduplication: repeat the stressed vowel and preceding con-
       sonant (when there is one present). When inflectional reduplica-
       tion occurs it changes the aspect of the verb to confirmative, or
       progressive. Contrast the following pairs of sentences:              Sumaga yo' giya Susupe.
              'I lived in Susupe.'
       MORPHOLOGY:            WORDS AND THEIR           STRUCTURE      Sumasaga yo' giya Susupe.
      'I am living in Susupe.'
      NOTE: Sumasaga also contains the infix -um-. The root is saga.
      Para bai hu saga giya guiya.
      'I will stay at his place.'
      Para bai hu sasaga giya guiya.
      'I will be staying at his place.'
This type of reduplication will be taken up again during the dis-
cussion of aspect.
ma- Passive Voice Marker. This prefix is used to mark the true
passive voice in Chamorro. It is possible that this prefix is the same
as the pronoun ma 'they'. Notice that the following sentence could
have two meanings:
      Mali'e' i palao'an.      'They saw the woman.'
                               'The woman was seen.'
It is possible that in Chamorro the pronoun ma can be used as an
impersonal pronoun, which could also be translated as passive
voice. A similar situation is found in English. For example, the
following two sentences are very similar in meaning:
      They say that smoking is bad for your health.
      It is said that smoking is bad for your health.
The first sentence uses the impersonal 'they'; the second uses the
true passive construction, also called extraposition.
      For purposes of clarity in the Chamorro writing system, the
pronoun ma is written separately, and the passive voice marker
is written as a prefix. Thus, we get the following in written Cham-
orro:      Ma li'e' i palao'an.
      'They saw the woman.'
      Mali'e' i palao'an.
      'The woman was seen.'
ma- Verbalizer. This is possibly the least understood of all the
Chamorro affixes, with the possible exception of -in-. It is probable
that in earlier Chamorro it was a productive verb prefix and its
distribution was clearly marked. In modern Chamorro its use is
not quite so clear.
     The peculiar thing about the verbalizer ma- is that it occurs
only with certain words. There is no way to predict by general
rules which Class II word will take ma- as the verbalizer rather
MORPHOLOGY:      WORDS     AND THEIR       STRUCTURE                  193       than -um-. The great majority of Class II words take -um- when
       they occur as predicates. There are also some words—all of which
       begin with m—that take no verbalizing affix (e.g., matai, magap,
       matto). And there are some that simply take ma-. Some of these
       roots that take ma- and their affixed forms are given here :
                Root Word                  Affixed Form
              ta'chong   'seat'       mata'chong       'sit down'
              fondo      'bottom'     mafondo          'sink'
              haga'      'blood'      mahaga'          'be in heat'
              pokkat     'walk'       mamokkat         'walk'
              cho'cho'   'work'       macho'cho'       'to work'
              udai       'ride'       ma'udai          'to ride'
            It is possible that this Verbalizer ma- is actually the same
       morpheme as the Passive Marker ma-. One could think of mata'-
       chong, for example, as a form that means 'to be seated', in which
       case the ma- might be considered passive. Such an interpretation
       would not fit the prefix ma- on a word like macho'cho' 'to work',
       because it would be impossible to think of macho'cho' as a passive
       construction. It seems preferable at this point to consider ma- a
       Verbalizer which we would like to know more about.
       Additional Problems of ma-. The prefix ma- appears to have
       become fossilized in a fairly large number of intransitive verbs
       and modifiers. That is to say, the ma- can no longer be separated
       and identified as a separate morpheme. The following words
       probably contain the fossilized prefix ma-.
              malagu     'run*        makaka       'itch'
              malangu    'get sick'   malayu       'wilted'
              malago'    'want'       matuhok      'sleepy'
              maleffa    'forget'
       Since the above words all have three syllables, and since they all
       begin with ma-, it is tempting to consider ma- a separate mor-
       pheme, as it is in the words mata'chong and    macho'cho'.However,
       if we remove the ma- from the words listed above, then we are
       left with meaningless stems, as follows:              *lagu         *leffa        *tuhok
              *langu        *kaka
              *lago'        *layu
       Of course, Chamorro does have the words lagu 'north, east' and
       MORPHOLOGY:             WORDS      AND   THEIR      STRUCTURE
lago' 'melt, tear', but these have no relationship in meaning to
malagu 'run' and malago' 'want'. Therefore, we must conclude
that they are different morphemes, and that the ma- of malagu
and malago' cannot be separated.
     There are quite a few words in Chamorro that begin with
ma-. Many of these present a very interesting problem. The ques-
tion is this: Is the initial ma- a fossilized prefix or not?
     For several of the words that begin with ma- the answer to
this question is probably no. We can assume that the word just
happens to begin with the sounds represented by ma-. Some of
these words are:
      magap          'to yawn'
      matto          'to come'
      matai          'to die'
      mata           'eye'
      mata'          'raw'
      maila'         'come'The initial ma- of these words is neither the passive marker nor the
verbalizer. It is simply part of the word.","[203, 204, 205, 206]"
"
Nouns
3.3.3   Among the Class II words there is a subclass that should be
        considered primarily as nouns. They are considered nouns for the
        following reasons: (1) In their base form they normally occupy
        a position in the sentence that can be designated ""subject of
        sentence"" or ""object of sentence""; (2) They generally correspond
        in meaning to nouns in other languages such as English, where
        they designate or name a person, living being, object, thing, etc.
             It must be remembered that other parts of speech—verbs,
        modifiers, location words, and even prepositions—may also
        function as subjects or objects of sentences. They can be converted
        to nouns, by a process called nominalization, by adding certain
        affixes. This process of nominalization will be discussed in a later
        section. (Cf. section 4.3.)
             At the present time we are concerned only with words which
        in their base form (no affixes) can be considered nouns. Some
       MORPHOLOGY:          WORDS AND THEIR           STRUCTUREexamples of words that should be subclassed (under Class II) as
nouns are the following:
      lamasa        'table'         Pedro
      guma'         'house*         Maria
      hanom         'water'         Saipan
      odda'         'soil'          Guam
      ga'lagu       'dog'
      mannok        'chicken'
      lahi          'man'
      patgon        'child'
      ha'ani        'day'
      sakkan        'year'
     How d o we know that all of the above words are nouns? We
mentioned two methods for determining if words are nouns or
not. One of the methods—probably the weaker one—is to check
for the meaning of the word. For example, if the word 'man*
in English is a noun, then the C h a m o r r o word lahi is probably
also a noun. By extension, the word meaning ' m a n ' is probably
a noun in all languages. The same test for meaning could be
applied to all of the words in the above list.
     The other method is to determine whether the word in
question can substitute for another noun in a given phrase or
sentence. For example, in the sentence
    Maolek i lahi.      'The man is good.'
the noun lahi functions as the subject of the sentence. Can the
other words in the list substitute for lahi in this same sentence?
Look at the following series of substitutions:
      Maolek i lamasa.
      Maolek i gima'.
      Maolek i hanom.
      Maolek i edda'.
      Maolek i ga'lagu.
      Maolek i mannok
      Maolek i lahi.
      Maolek i patgon.
      Maolek i ha'ani.
      Maolek i sakkan
      Maolek si Pedro.
      Maolek si Maria.
      Maolek iya Saipan.
      Maolek iya Guam.
MORPHOLOGY:      WORDS AND THEIR             STRUCTURE                      99       Since all of the words in the list can substitute for one another in
       the same slot, then they must all belong to the same class. We
       have designated this subclass of Class II words as nouns.
             Notice that the last four nouns in the list require a different
       article. Pedro and Maria require the article si, while Saipan and
       Guam require the article iya. This would suggest that even a further
       subclassification of nouns is required.
            Indeed, a formal grammar of Chamorro would require an
       elaborate system for subclassifying all of the parts of speech.
       Since this is not a formal grammar, we will not get involved with
       a detailed system for the subclassification of nouns. It may prove
       interesting to subclassify the few nouns in the foregoing list to
       suggest how the system of subclassification might work.
            The most convenient way to approach the subclassification
       of nouns is to use a system that might be called a binary system
       of semantic features. For example, a word like lamasa is countable;
       that is to say, we can count dos na lamasa, tres na lamasa, and
       so on. A word like hanom is not countable. Using the binary
       feature system we can say that all nouns are either countable
       ( + count), or not countable (— count). We could say that
       lamasa has the feature < + count > while hanom has the feature
        < — c o u n t > . NOTE: Semantic features of words are customarily
       put within angle brackets <        >.
            What are some of the other semantic features that are
       needed to subclassify the nouns listed above? In addition to
       knowing whether or not the nouns can be counted, we need to
       know whether they are animate or not. The feature notation for
       this is < + a n i m a t e > or < — a n i m a t e > . Other features that
       should be specified for the above nouns are as follows:            < + concrete^       < — concrete^
            <C +human >         < — human >
            <1+proper >            proper >            As stated earlier, a formal grammar would need to include
       these features (and probably others) in order to specify the rules
       for forming correct sentences. Such feature specifications are
       needed to prevent the rules of the grammar from producing such
       unacceptable sentences as the following:              *Chumocho i lamasa.
              •Kumuentos i ha'ani.

                Let us look at some of the nouns listed above to determine
            what semantic features they contain.                        lamasa             hanom                ga'lagu              lahi

            the basis of < ± proper> and < + human > , but we will not get
            much more specific than that.","[109, 110, 111, 112]"
"       Notice the following pair of sentences for the use of un:              Malago' yo' niyok.
              'I want a coconut.'
              Malago' yo' un niyok.
              'I want one coconut (not two).'
       In the second sentence above, the article un is used to emphasize
       oneness. (The numeral unu is used when actually counting.)
             The article un occurs most frequently in fixed idiomatic
       expressions such as Un dia which means 'Once upon a time' or
       'One day', and is used for beginning stories.
             The article ¡a is not used in Chamorro except in certain words
       where it has become a part of the word, in family names, and in
       telling time.
             An example of a word in which the Spanish article la has
       become a part of the Chamorro word is lamasa 'table', which
       comes from Spanish la mesa 'the table', where la is the definite
       feminine article. In the process of being borrowed into Chamorro,
       the Spanish article la simply became part of the word. Another
       borrowed word in which the article became fused to the noun
       is la'uya 'pot' from Spanish la olla.
             The article la is found in family names such as De la Cruz
       and De la Rosa, both of which have various spellings, such as De
       La Cruz, De la Cruz, and Dela Cruz.
             La is also used in telling time. In this case it has become
       fused with the Spanish preposition a. The Chamorro form is ala
       as in Oran ala una 'one o'clock'.
             The Spanish article las is used in Chamorro only when telling
       time, and it is fused with the Spanish preposition a when it is
       preceded by oran.",[149]
"             The Spanish prepositions that were adopted by the Chamorro
       speakers raise interesting linguistic questions which can not be
       answered. The most important question is: Why were some Span-
       ish prepositions borrowed while others were not? The pre-Spanish
       C h a m o r r o language had ways of expressing all of the concepts that
       are expressed by Spanish prepositions in the above examples. Even
       in modern Chamorro it is possible, but not easy, to avoid using all
       of the Spanish prepositions.
             It is also interesting to note the changes in meaning that the
       prepositions have undergone through borrowing. In several cases
       (e.g., kon todu) the primary Spanish meaning o f ' h o w e v e r ' has been
       completely lost.

"      Modification of Verbs. There are very few words in C h a m o r r o that
      are strictly limited to the function of modification of verbs. All
      of the verb modifiers—or adverbs, to use the traditional term—
      also serve to modify sentences. As will be shown, there are certain
      structural differences when the modifier has a direct relationship
      to the verb.
           Costenoble lists several different types of adverbs. I would
      classify most of his adverbs differently. For example, under the
      heading Adverbs of Direction (405) he lists such words as haya
      'east',* lagu 'west', magi 'here', and halom 'in'. In the present
      analysis, these words are considered simply location words
      (cf. 3.4.4). Under Adverbs of Place Costenoble lists such words
      as guini 'here', guenao 'there', hihot 'near', and este 'here' (1940:
      406). In the present analysis guini and guenao are classed as Loca-      *For a discussion of the differences in Chamorro directional terminology see

         hagas 'long time', sesso 'often', nigap 'yesterday', and agupa'
         'tomorrow'. These probably come closer to being ""adverbs,"" or
         modifiers of verbs, than the other adverbs that Costenoble lists.
         Since they are all time words, they are usually associated directly
         with the verb and therefore may be considered modifiers of
         Verbs.
               Costenoble also lists Adverbs of Type and Manner and
         Adverbs of Modality (pp. 410, 412).
               It seems unrealistic to set up a special class of words in
         Chamorro to be labeled ""adverbs"" because most of the words
         listed by Costenoble can function as predicates or modifiers
         of nouns. I prefer to examine some of the characteristic features
         of modification of verbs.
               The word chaddek 'fast, quickly' is often used to modify a
         verb, as in the following sentence:
               Kumuentos chaddek gue'. 'He talked fast.'
         However, the modifier chaddek can be moved around so that it is
         at the beginning of the statement, as in:
               Chaddek kumuentos gue'.
         Or, it can occur at the end of the sentence:
               Kumuentos gue' chaddek.
         In addition, the modifier chaddek can be followed directly by the
         subject pronoun:
              Chaddek gue' kumuentos.
         All of the above sentences mean essentially the same thing. The
         movement of the modifier suggests a slight change in emphasis,
         but the basic meaning of the sentence remains unchanged.
              If the verb (or predicate) ends with a vowel, then there is a
         significant change in the structure when the modifier immediately
         follows the verb. Notice the difference in the following set of
         sentences:              Malagu gue' chaddek.
              'He ran fast.'
              Malagon chaddek gue'.
              'He ran fast.' or 'His running is fast.'
212                                                                 SYNTAX      When the modifier immediately follows a verb that ends with a
      vowel, an n is added to the verb. This n serves no special gram-
      matical function, but it must be added to the verb. This n (which
      can be called an excrescent consonant) serves the same purpose as
      the final n in plural possessive constructions (see 4.4 below) and
      in the modification constructions where the headword comes
      before the modifier.
           Some additional examples of this final n are given here in the
      following pairs of sentences:
            Ha hatsa i lamasa chaddek.
            'He lifted the table quickly.'
            Ha hatsan chaddek i lamasa.
            'He quickly lifted the table' or 'His lifting the table was quick.'
            Ha pacha i feggon gi kubatde-na.
            'He touched the stove timorously.'
            Ha pachan kubatde i feggon.
            'He touched the stove timorously' or 'His touching the stove
              was timorous.'
           The alternate translations for the sentences in which the
      modifier immediately follows the verb suggest that there is a slight
      difference in meaning, a difference which is not easy to explain.
      Modification of Sentences. Sometimes it is difficult to say whether
      a modifier modifies a single word in a sentence or the entire
      sentence. In the case of nouns it is pretty easy to see how a parti-
      cular modifier relates directly to a specific noun, as in the follow-
      ing examples:
            Modifier        Headword
            i bunita na     palao'an         'the pretty woman'
            i dankolo na    ga'lagu          'the big dog'
            i mannge' na    nenkanno'        'the delicious food'
            Headword    Modifier
            i tendan Filipino            'the Filipino store'
            i sapatos Japanese           'the Japanese shoes'
            i tronkon niyok              'the coconut tree'
           However, when the headword is not a noun, the relationship
      of the modifier to the rest of the sentence is sometimes not easy
      to determine.
           In the sentence Malagu gue' chaddek ' H e ran fast' we might
      say that the modifier chaddek modifies the sentence Malagu gue'.
SYNTAX                                                                     213         In the sentence Malagon chaddek gue' we might say that chaddek
         modifies the verb malagu. And in the sentence Chaddek malagu
         gue' we could say that chaddek modifies the following sentence.
              Another instance where there is a close relationship between
         a modifier of a verb and a modifier of the sentence can be seen
         clearly in the modifier chatta' 'hardly, barely'. This modifier has
         another form chat that is used when it clearly modifies a verb.
         Notice the contrast in the following two sentences:               Verb Modifier: Hu chattokcha' i guihan.
                              'I barely speared the fish.'
               Sentence Modifier: Chatta' hu tokcha' i guihan.
                                  'I barely speared the fish.'","[222, 223, 224, 225]"
"              Sentence 5 is nonfocus and has no particular topic marked
         for emphasis. Sentence 9 shows the goal focus construction, but
         no topic is marked for emphasis. In sentence 6 the emphasis is
         on the topic / taotao since it occurs at the beginning of the sen-
256                                                                SYNTAX         tence. In sentence 7 there is more emphasis on the N P i taotao
         because the verb now contains the actor focus infix -um-. In
         sentence 8 the subject N P is emphasized even more because the
         verb bende has been nominalized and incorporated into the
         subject NP.
              Sentence 9 shows a simple goal focus construction which
         has the effect of placing some emphasis on the object N P i kareta.
         However, in sentence 9 there is nothing marked as the topic, that
         is, nothing in the sentence has been singled out for special em-
         phasis. In sentence 10 the object N P has been topicalized by
         placing it at the beginning of the sentence. And in sentence 11
         the object N P is emphasized even more by the same process that
         we saw in sentence 3, namely, the nominalization of the verb
         and the incorporation of the verb into the goal NP.
               Topicalization is a fairly complex grammatical process.
         It is used very frequently when the speaker wishes to place em-
         phasis on one or another of the parts (or constituents) of the
         sentence. In some cases the only change that is involved is the
         relocation of the topicalized part of the sentence so that it occurs
         at the beginning. In some instances additional changes in the verb
         are required. We will not go into the formal details of the changes
         that take place in the verb at this time. The following sentences
         will illustrate topicalization in a transitive sentence that contains
         modifiers of manner, time, and place. How would you describe
         the differences in meaning of these sentences?","[267, 268]"
"
POSSESSION4.4      Possession in Chamorro is highly regular and relatively simple.
         The possessive pronouns, which were discussed in section 3.4.1,
         are used in most possessive constructions. The possessive pro-
         nouns of Chamorro are listed again here:
                       1st          -hu       'my'
              Singular 2nd          -mu       'your'
                       3rd          -na       'his, her'
                        1st incl.   -ta       'our inclusive'
                        1st excl.   -mami     'our exclusive'
               Plural   2nd         -miyu     'your-2 or more'
                        3rd         -niha     'their-2 or more'         When one of these pronouns is affixed to a stem, the primary
         stress of the affixed form is moved to the penultimate syllable, as
         the following examples illustrate:              lapes          lapes-hu         'my pencil'
              lamasa         lamasa-na        'his table'
              guma'          gima'-mami       'our house'
                                                         SYNTAXIf the stem has a medial consonant cluster and ends with a vowel
the allomorph -ku occurs in place of -hu:
     tommo             tommo-ku            'my knee'
     lepblo            lepblo-ku           'my book'
     katta             katta-ku            'my letter'
     If the stem ends with a vowel, and if the possessive pronoun
is -mami, -miyu or -hiha, the excrescent consonant n must be
added to the stem:
     kareta       karetan-mami        'our car'
     lepblo       lepblon-miyu        'your book'
     tata         tatan-niha          'their father'     When the possessor can be expressed by a pronoun, the pos-
sessive pronoun is usually affixed directly to the noun. Notice the
following sentences:
      Si Juan ha sodda' i gima'-na.
      'Juan found his house.'
      Si Maria ha taitai i lepblo-iia.
      'Maria read her book.'
      I famagu'on ma gimen i lechen-niha.
      'The children drank their milk.'
Possessive Nouns. When a noun is the possessor there are two
grammatical forms that may occur. One of these forms involves
using the third person possessive pronoun (singular or plural)
as in the above examples, followed by the possessor noun. The
following examples illustrate this type of possessive construction:
      i gima'-na si Rosa
      'Rosa's house'
      i lepblo-iia i estudiante
      'the student's book'
      i malago'-niha i taotao
      'the people's wish'
      i lahi-na si Pedro
      'Pedro's son'
     The other form that can occur when a noun is the possessor
is sometimes called the construct form. This form does not use
the possessive pronouns, but it does involve the final excrescent
n that we saw earlier in the modification constructions such as
SYNTAX                                                                    223         tendan Filipino. This excrescent n occurs when the possessed
         noun stem ends with a vowel. The construct form of the possessive
         is probably used more frequently than the full form which uses
         the possessive pronoun and the noun. The following examples
         will illustrate the differences between the full possessive form and
         the construct form:                 Full Possessive   Form             Construct   Form
               i gima'-ña si Rosa                i gima' Rosa
               i lepblon-ña i estudiante         i lepblon estudiante
               i malago'-ñiha i taotao           i malago' taotao
               i lahi-ña si Pedro                i lahen Pedro
               i haga-ña i rai                   i hagan rai              There is probably a degree of difference in meaning between
         the full possessive form and the construct form, but the difference
         is difficult to translate. For example, the phrase / gima'-ña si
         Rosa might be translated as 'Rosa's house', while i gima' Rosa
         might be translated as 'the house of Rosa' and might be used
         when one is talking about the house as a location rather than as
         something that belongs to Rosa.
         Possession with Classifiers. The classifiers of Chamorro were
         discussed earlier in section 3.5.0. They are often used in posses-
         sive constructions when the thing possessed is animal, edible,
         inanimate, or drinkable. The classifiers are listed again here:
               na'            'edible things'
               ga'            'non-human animals'
               iyo            'inanimate objects'
               gimen          'drinkable things'         Of these four classifiers the first three are commonly used, the last
         one much less so.
              The use of na' and ga' is obligatory in possessive construc-
         tions. One does not say *i mannok-ku for 'my chicken'. The
         statement would have to be made in one of the following ways:
               i na'-hu mannok             'my chicken (to eat),
               i ga'-hu mannok             'my chicken (pet).
         The classifiers will take all of the possessive pronouns, as the
         following paradigm will show:
               Guaha na'-hu guihan.
               'I have a fish (to eat).'
224                                                           SYNTAX            Guaha na'-mu guihan.
            'You have a fish.'
            Guaha na'-na guihan.
            'He has a fish.'
            Guaha na'-ta guihan.
            'We have a fish.'
            Guaha na'-mami guihan.
            'We (excl.) have a fish.'
           Guaha na'-miyu guihan.
           'You (pi.) have a fish.'
           Guaha na'-niha guihan.
           'They have a fish.'
           The other classifiers—ga', iyo and gimen—also follow this
      paradigm.
           The classifier iyo is possibly being used less in modern Cha-
      morro than in earlier times. It is still commonly used in many
      places in the sense of 'belongs to'.
           Iyo-ku i lepblo.
           'The book belongs to me.'
           Iyo-na ayu na guma'.
           'That house belongs to him.'
           Iyon-mami na lepblo enao.
           'That book belongs to us.'
      When iyo is followed directly by a noun, the excrescent n must be
      used:
            iyon tasi     'belonging to the sea'
            iyon lahi     'belonging to the man'
            iyon tano'    'belonging to the earth' or 'terrestrial'
            iyon langet   'belonging to the sky' or 'heavenly'
      Possessive Pronouns as Subject. In certain constructions the
      possessive pronouns are used as actor of the sentence. It was
      pointed out in section 3.3.2 that certain verbs always take the
      possessive pronouns as subject pronoun when used in the non-
      future tense. They are ya-, alok and ga'o:
            Ya-hu chumocho.
           ' I like to eat.'
           Ilek-hu ""no"".
           'I said ""no"".'
           Ga'o-ku guihan.
           'I prefer fish.'

         in many questions which contain either hafa or hayi as the ques-
         tion word. Some sample questions will illustrate:
               Hafa lini'e'-mu?
               'What did you see?'
               Hafa malago'-mu?
               'What do you want?'
               Hafa bidada-na?
               'What is he doing?'
               Hafa guinahan-miyu?
               'What do you have?'
               Hayi lini'e'-mu?
               'Who did you see?'
               Hayi inatatan-mu?
               'Who are you taking care of?'","[233, 234, 235, 236, 237]"
"Class II Words. Words in C h a m o r r o are said to belong to Class II
provided they can form the predicate of a sentence with the
pronoun yo' as the subject pronoun. Some Class II words may
require the insertion of the infix -um- or the prefix ma- before
they can form the predicate. Some examples are given here:

       Special Problem of ma-. According to the present analysis of
       Chamorro, there are three morphemes that are spelled ma. One is
       the third person plural subject pronoun ma meaning 'they'.
       Another is the passive prefix ma- mentioned above in the definition
       of Class I words. The third is the verbalizer ma- seen in the words
       listed above (macho'cho', mata'chong, etc.) See section 3.5.3 for
       a discussion of verbalizer.
             It is possible that all three forms of ma come from the same
       historical root. But in the analysis of modern Chamorro, it seems
       better to treat them as separate morphemes.
             For the non-native Chamorro speaker (and for the linguist)
       it would be very helpful if we could find rules to predict which
       roots take the infix -um- and which roots take the prefix ma-.
       Why, for example, should chocho 'eat' take -um- to become
       chumocho while cho'cho' 'work' becomes macho'cho'? Or, why
       should tohge 'stand up' become tumohge while ta'chong 'seat'
       becomes mata'chong 'sit down'? Unfortunately, we must conclude
       that the use of -um- or ma- is unpredictable, but that the majority
       of the Class II words take -um-. Ma- as a verbalizer can be con-
       sidered irregular. It is also possible, and perhaps preferable, to
       consider the ma- as part of the root.
       MORPHOLOGY:          WORDS    AND THEIR           STRUCTURE      Another peculiar aspect of ma- is that it appears to have
become fossilized in a fairly large number of words in Chamorro.
That is to say it has become an inseparable part of the word.
There are quite a few words of three syllables, the first of which
is ma-. It is tempting to try to separate ma- from the rest of the
word, the result of which would be a root word of two syllables
(e.g., ta'chong from mata'chong). In the majority of cases, if we
remove ma-, the remaining two syllables have no meaning. Some
words of this type are:
      malagu     'run'        malate'    'intelligent'
      malago'    'want'       ma'udai    'ride'
      maleffa    'forget'     magahet    'truly'
In the above words no further morphemic analysis can be made.
We can only suspect that the initial syllable of these words was a
prefix that became fossilized and is now inseparable from the
original root. The above words now stand as roots.","[90, 91, 92]"
"           When n o u n s d o not function as predicates of stative sen-
      tences, they are usually pluralized by adding the word siha following
      the n o u n . This word is identical in sound and shape to the third
      person plural p r o n o u n siha. F o r purposes of grammatical analysis
      they can be considered the same morpheme. T h e following sen-
      tences will illustrate how siha is used as a plural m a r k e r for n o u n s :
                      Singular Form                       Plural Form
             Metgot i estudiante.               Manmetgot i estudiante siha.
             'The student is strong.'           'The students are strong.'
             Malate' i mediku.                  Manmalate' i mediku siha.
             'The doctor is intelligent.'       'The doctors are intelligent.'
             Malingu i ga'lagu.                 Manmalingu i ga'lagu siha.
             'The dog was lost.'                'The dogs were lost.'
             Ñalang i babui.                    Maññalang i babui siha.
             'The pig was hungry.'              'The pigs were hungry.'
              T h e plural m a r k e r siha is often omitted. It is n o t really
      necessary f r o m a logical point of view because the prefix man-
      is enough to tell us that the subject n o u n is plural. F o r example,
      in the sentence Manbrabu i mediku we k n o w t h a t mediku refers t o
      m o r e t h a n one because of the prefix man- on the word brabu.
      Since the additional plural m a r k e r siha is grammatically redun-
      d a n t , it is often omitted in speech.

         that have irregular plural forms. All of these nouns refer to
         people. The singular and plural forms of the irregular nouns are
         listed below:
                   Singular                    Plural               lahi           'man'     lalahi          'men'
               palao'an       'woman'   famalao'an      'women'
               patgon         'child'   famagu'on       'children'
              A slightly larger subgroup of the irregular nouns are pluraliz-
         ed by the prefix man-. These nouns also refer to persons. And
         some have been derived from verbs through the nominalizing
         process of reduplication. The following list will show the nouns
         that are pluralized by adding man-. (It should be stressed that
         these nouns are pluralized by the prefix man- even when they are
         not functioning as predicates. The regular morphophonemic
         changes caused by man- will be observed except where another
         type of affixation, e.g., reduplication has already taken place,
         as in the case of the derived nouns.)

         pluralized by the prefix man- when they d o not function as the
         predicate of a stative sentence?
              The question word mangge is also pluralized by adding the
         prefix man-. This is the only one of the question words that is
         marked for plural, as in the following examples:
                   Singular                      Plural
               Mangge i lepblo?         Manmangge i lepblo (siha)?

                'Where is the man?'         'Where are the men? 1         T h e fact that mangge is the only question word that is pluralized
         can be accounted for by the fact that it is a contracted f o r m of
         manu nai gaige. T h u s we can assume that the entire phrase, in-
         cluding the existential verb gaige, has been pluralized.","[246, 247, 248]"
"
Particles3.4.7       In addition to the articles described above, C h a m o r r o has some
            additional ""little words"" that are called particles. In a sense they
            are the glue that holds the language together. Although they
            are small and almost never receive primary stress, they form a
            very important part of the grammatical system of Chamorro.
            Because they are ""little words"" and seldom receive primary
            stress, they are very difficult for the person who is trying to learn
            something about the rules of the language.
                 The particles that will be discussed here are na and nai.
            In many instances in rapid speech they sound alike. This makes
            any clear statements about their use even more difficult.
            Na
            The particle na might be called a linking particle since it serves
            to link together different words in a phrase and certain types
            of clauses. Each of these functions will be described below.
                 The particle na is used in noun phrases to link a modifier
            with a following noun, as in the following examples:
                  i yemmok na palao'an      'the fat woman'
                  i dikike' na patgon       'the small child'
                  i dânkolo na taotao       'the big man'
                  i kâkati na palao'an       'the crying woman'            When na follows a modifier which ends in a vowel, it is frequently
            contracted to -n. Hence, one might hear either of the following
            sets of phrases:
                  Formal Speech          Fast Speech        English
                  i dânkolo na taotao    i dankolon taotao 'the big man'
                  i kâkati na palao'an   i kakaten palao'an 'the crying woman'
                  i betde na kareta      i betden kareta    'the green car'
                  i bunita na palao'an   i bunitan palao'an 'the pretty girl'            When the modifier follows the headword of the phrase, and when
            the headword ends with a vowel, the final -n always occurs. If the
            headword ends with a consonant, then there is no linking particle.
            N o t e the following examples:

            It should also be pointed out that the use of na in modifica-
       tion structures is optional when guaha is used:

combining main (or matrix) sentences with complement clauses.
Complement clauses differ somewhat from subordinate clauses
in the following two ways: (1) They may be introduced by the
complementizer na or one of the question words: (2) They bear a
very close relationship to the verb phrase of the matrix sentence.
     Some examples of complex sentences with different kinds of
complement clauses are given below. The basic sentences (in-
cluding ""dummy"" elements) and the complex sentence that
includes them are given. The complementizer and the comple-
ment clause are underlined. The dummy element in the basic
sentence is marked by*:
      Basic Sentences:    Hu tungo' hafa*.

changed from non-future to future, as in the following example:

         the complement clause. The use of the complementizer appears
         to be determined by the verb of the main clause, but the details
         of this grammatical feature have not been worked out. The
         following sentences illustrate complement clauses that are not

"        Nai       The particle nai presents certain difficulties in describing how it
       functions. It is sometimes used as a reduced form of the subor-
       dinator anai 'when'; it can be used in place of the linking particle
       na in some cases; sometimes native speakers of C h a m o r r o are
       not really certain whether they are saying nai, anai, or na.
             In spite of the apparent confusion, there are some rules that
       may be given concerning the use of the particle nai.
             It appears that there are actually two homonyms pronounced
       nai, or that they may be the same word used in different ways.
       For present purposes it seems better to claim that there are two
       particles pronounced nai. We will call one of them the linking
       particle nai; the other we will call the emphatic particle nai.
             The linking particle nai has certain specific functions and
       some that are not quite so specific. The specific functions will
       be considered first.
             As a linking particle, nai usually refers to 'place where' as in
       the following:
              I sanhiyong nai ta maigo'.
              'Outside is where we will sleep.'
              Giya Tanapag riai mafanagu yo'.
              'It was at Tanapag where I was born.'
              NOTE: In the two sentences above, nai could also be considered
              a complementizer. This will be taken up again in the discussion
              of complement and relative clauses.",[153]
"It is not uncommon at all for both of the prefixes above to occur

              'The men speared fish.'       -in- Goal Focus Infix. This infix is used in verb constructions that
       are called Goal Focus. This means that focus of the sentence is
       on the goal or object of the action. (This will be discussed more
       fully in the section on syntax.)
              'Hafa lini'e'-mu?
              'What did you see?'

              Lini'e' i palao'an ni lahi.
              'The man saw the woman.'       -in- Nominalizing Infix. This infix is probably the same as the
       preceding one. A technical grammer of Chamorro would probably
       show that they both serve the same function, namely to focus
       attention on the goal. The nominalizing infix is often used to
       convert verbs to nouns; hence its name. This can be illustrated by
       the examples below:
                   Verb                  Nominalized Form
              hasso      'think'     i hinasso    'the thought'
              faisen     'ask'       i finaisen   'the question'
              konne'     'catch'     i kinenne'   'the thing caught'
              sangan     'tell'      i sinangan   'the thing told'       In all of the nominalized forms above the noun is the result, or
       'goal', of the action of the verb. This is good evidence that the
       two infixes -in- are really one and the same.
       -in- Adjectivizing Infix. This infix is also probably related to the
       Goal Focus infix. When it is affixed to a noun, it converts a noun
       or verb to a type of modifier, In this respect, -in- should be classed
       as a derivational affix. It is included here because of its obvious
       relationship to the other infix -in-. Some examples of the Adjec-
       tivizing Infix are as follows:                 Root Word                   Infixed Form

     The infix -in- has some additional functions which have not
been described under the three categories of -in- listed above.
These other functions are not easy to explain, due to a lack of
complete understanding of the function of this infix. It appears
that all of the forms which include the infix -in- are somehow
related to its primary function which we are calling Goal Focus.
This means that whenever the infix -in- is used, the "" f o c u s "" of the
statement is on that word which includes the infix: or if -in-
occurs in the predicate, then the "" f o c u s "" is on the goal of the
action. (One might substitute the word ""emphasis"" for "" f o c u s , ""
although the two do not mean exactly the same thing.)

"            The preposition kon is used very often in C h a m o r r o speech.
       Like di, it is often used like a conjunction or subordinator. Most
       of the time it is used in fixed idiomatic expressions which were
       borrowed from Spanish. In such cases the meaning is often not
       the same in Chamorro as in Spanish, as the following examples
       will show:
              Sangani yo' kon tiempo.
              'Tell me ahead of time.'
              Kon petmisu.
              'With permission.'
              Na'i yo' ni i papet-mu kon todu i salape'-mu.
              'Give me your paper together with your money.'
              Humanao si Jose kon todu si Juan.
              'Jose left and so did Juan.'
              Humanao yo' yan i lalahi kon todu si Juan.
              'I went with the boys, including Juan.'",[141]
"Some examples which will illustrate these differences between the
Rota dialect and the Guam/Saipan dialect are given here:
      Guam/Saipan                     Rota      a. tommo 'knee'                tomo
         meggai 'many'               megai
      b. mamahlao 'bashful'          mamalao
         tohge 'stand up'            toge
      c. espia 'look for*            espiha
         tieras 'scissors'           tiherasIn the words of the a. group, both consonants (mm, gg) are pro-
nounced clearly in the Guam/Saipan dialect, while only a single
consonant is pronounced in the Rota dialect. In the words of the
b. group, t h e j i is clearly pronounced in the Guam/Saipan dialect,
but is omitted in the Rota dialect.
     There are other formal differences in the different dialects
of Chamorro, but these have not been sufficiently investigated to
attempt to describe them here.
2     The Sound System of Chamorro
INTRODUCTION
      Most of the older grammar books for the European languages
      did not have very much information on the sound systems of
      those languages. It was just assumed that the spelling system was
      adequate to represent the actual sounds of the language. Perhaps
      the reason for this is that most of the older grammar books of
      European languages that we may have studied were written
      before grammarians clearly understood the importance of dif-
      ferentiating between the spelling system of a language and the
      actual sounds that occur in the language. As we will see, the spell-
      ing system and the sound system of a language are two different
      things.
            If we are to understand the entire system of the Chamorro
      language, it is important to have a clear understanding of the
      sound system, which involves the separate sounds that occur in
      the language and the changes that they undergo when they occur
      in different environments. This is the reason why the first section
      of this grammar—and it is a fairly long section—concentrates
      exclusively on the sound system of Chamorro.
            We are taking the approach here that Chamorro speech can
      be broken up into separate sounds, or segments, This concept of
      breaking a ""word"" or a ""stream of speech"" into separate segments
      of sound is not a new one. When the Greeks devised an alphabe-
      tic writing system some 3,000 years ago, they were devising a
      method to represent individual segments of sound. The writing
      systems for the languages of the world that use alphabets (as
      opposed to the Chinese writing system, for example) are based
      on this concept. All alphabetic writing systems are an attempt to
      represent separate segments of sound by separate written symbols.
            The question has been raised more than once as to whether
      it is possible to break up a stream of speech into separate, dis-                                 11
                      THE SOUND SYSTEM          OF     CHAMORRO crete sounds, or segments. (The term segment is used here to
 refer to a single sound unit.) For example, in a simple word such
 as the English word ""yes,"" how many separate segments of sound
 are found? Most people would probably answer ""three."" They
 are y, e, and s. But, one might ask the question, ""Where does the
>>-sound stop and the e-sound begin? Or where does the e-sound
 stop and the s-sound begin?"" The question is not an easy one to
 answer.
       The situation is probably further complicated by our precon-
 ceptions about sounds and spelling. We tend to think that the
 letters of the alphabet represent the sounds of the language. We
 do not have to look very far to find evidence that this assumption
is not correct. For example, the English word ""checks"" has six
letters. How many separate sounds—or segments of sound—does
the word have? Most linguists would agree that the word
""checks"" has four separate sounds. The first segment of sound is
represented by the letters ch. The second segment is represented
by the letter e, the third by ck, and the fourth by s. Thus, we have
a word that contains four separate segments of sound that are
represented by six letters.
      A different, but related, situation is found in a word like
""box."" It has three letters. How many segments of sound does
the word have? Most linguists would agree that it has four
separate sounds. One sound is represented by b. The second sound
is represented by o. However, the last two segments of sound
(which might be spelled phonetically as ks) are represented by the
single letter x.
      These examples from English are used to illustrate that there
can be a significant difference between the spelling system adopted
for a language and the sound system. In the pages to follow we
will concentrate on the sound system of Chamorro. The spelling
system will be discussed later in section 2.8.
      In order to discuss the segments of the sound system of
Chamorro, it will be necessary to use a few technical terms and
symbols. These technical terms will be used as sparingly as
possible.
      In learning to use an English dictionary, most people learn
something about phonetic spelling. For example, in the Webster's
Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, the word ""cancel"" is followed
immediately by the phonetic respelling ['kan (t)-sel]; the word
""write"" is respelled as ['ritj. These phonetic respellings are an
attempt to show by using the written symbols of the International
THE SOUND SYSTEM      OF    CHAMORRO                                      13       Phonetic Alphabet how a word is pronounced by native speakers
       of the language. In phonetics, we try to show how each segment
       of the word is actually pronounced. (Generally speaking, linguists
       do not use the symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet
       (IPA) because the symbols available in the IPA are often not
       adequate to represent the sounds of some of the more ""exotic""
       languages of the world. The few phonetic symbols used in the
       discussion of Chamorro will be explained as they are introduced.)
            Linguists—and especially phoneticians—usually go a little
       further with phonetics than dictionary makers do. Linguists
       sometimes wish to show all of the fine distinctions of the sounds
       of a language. They do this by using various systems of phonetic
       spelling and by describing how sounds are made by referring to
       the parts of the body that are used in making the sounds. In
       order to make our discussion easier and perhaps more meaning-
       ful, a drawing is given here. Various parts of this drawing are
       labeled. The names of these parts will be used from time to time
       in the discussion of the sounds of Chamorro.","[22, 23, 24, 25]"
"
Changing Parts of Speech
3.3.5     In section 3.3 it was pointed out that a single word can often
          function as a verb, noun, or modifier. This is the main reason
          why it is difficult to put Chamorro words into a single category
          such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. Yet, we did establish the classes
          labeled I, II, and III for the major words in Chamorro. In addi-
          tion, we examined subclasses of these classes, and we referred to
          them as verbs, nouns, and modifiers.
               It is important to remember that only root words—words
          that contained no affixes—were assigned to one of these classes.
               In this section we will look briefly at some of the processes
          involved when words in Chamorro change from one subclass to
          another. These processes are known generally as affixation. The
          several types of affixation will be discussed more fully in a later
          section. (Cf. section 3.5.2.)
               For the present discussion on how words change from one
          class to another we must establish some simple criteria for defining
          verbs, nouns, and modifiers.
               A verb (for present purposes of classification) is a word that
          functions as the predicate of a sentence where some action is
          involved. (This excludes stative sentences, such as Mediku si
          Juan 'Juan is a doctor.') In the sentences below, the verb is un-
          derlined:
                Ha hatsa si Juan i patgon.
                'Juan lifted the child.'
                Mamaigo' si Juan.
                'Juan is sleeping.'
                Gumugupu i paluma.
                'The bird is flying.'
               A noun (for present purposes) is a word that functions as the
          subject or object of a sentence. In the sentences below, the noun
          is underlined:
                Ha gimen si Juan i hanom.
                'Juan drank the water.'

      'The blood was red.'

"       Spanish Prepositions. The Spanish prepositions used in Chamorro
       can be divided into two groups, those that are used freely in com-
       bination with Chamorro words to form new expressions (Group I)
       and those that are used exclusively or primarily in idiomatic
       MORPHOLOGY:            WORDS AND THEIR         STRUCTUREexpressions (Group II). The Spanish prepositions that can be
used freely in Chamorro will be called Group I, and they will be
discussed first. These Group I prepositions are as follows:
      desde
      asta     (Sp. hasta)
      sin
      pot      (Sp. por)
      kontra   (Sp. contra)
     As mentioned earlier, the prepositions desde and asta are used
in place of the Chamorro prepositions ginen and para in some
cases. For example, one might hear any one of the following
phrases. Notice the different possible combinations of preposi-
tions.
     desde Guam asta Saipan         'from Guam to Saipan'
     desde Guam para Saipan         'from Guam to Saipan'
     ginen Guam asta Saipan         'from Guam to Saipan'
     ginen Guam para Saipan         'from Guam to Saipan'Of course, not all speakers of Chamorro would use all of the above
combinations of Spanish and Chamorro prepositions. A general
rule is that ginen and para are used more frequently for referring
to space relations while desde and asta are used for time. One
might hear, for example, desde nigap asta agupa' 'from yesterday
to tomorrow', but one never hears *ginen nigap para agupa'.
     We might conclude then that desde and asta are sometimes
used to express relationships of space, but ginen and para are
never used to express relationships of time.
     Further examples of the use of desde and asta are as follows:
     Maigo' gue' desde i painge asta pa'go.
     'He slept from last night to now.'
     Manmangge' yo' desde i ega'an asta pa'go.
     'I have been writing from morning to now.'
     Desde i ma'pos na simana
     'Since last week'
     Ti para u ta fanali'e' asta i Lunes.
     'We will not see each other until Monday.'
     Asta agupa'.
     'Until tomrorow.'
     Desde nigap matto yo'.
     'I came since yesterday (and am still here).'

"         (Some C h a m o r r o speakers claim that the word order in the second
         set of sentences above is the preferred order. In any case, both
         types of word order are permissible.)
              It is possible to construct many variations of the above
         sentences. For example, we could take the sentence Ha fahan si
         Juan i chandiha and transform it to any of the following:               Si Juan fumahan i chandia.
               Finahan i chandia as Juan.
               Mamahan si Juan chandia.
                                                          SYNTAX The main point here is that the three sentences above are trans-
formations (to use the linguistic term) of the basic transitive
 sentence Si Juan ha fahan i chandia. Put in another way, the three
 sentences above are derived from the basic transitive sentence
 Si Juan ha fahan i chandia. They are derived sentences.
      In the sections to follow, and especially in the section on the
focus system, we will examine more closely the ways in which
 derived sentences are formed from basic sentence types.
Intransitive Sentence. The second basic sentence type is the
intransitive sentence. The basic elements of an intransitive sentence
are an intransitive verb (see 3.3.2 and 4.6) and a subject. Some
examples of basic intransitive sentences are given here:
       Verb                   Subject
      Umo'o'o'                i gayu.
      Bumabaila               i palao'an.
      Ma'udai                 i taotao.
      Gumupu                  i paharu.
      Manmata'chong           i famalao'an.
      Humanao                 gue'.
      Manhanao                hit.
It was pointed out in section 4.6 that the intransitive verb can
take various types of modifiers, as can the noun phrase (cf. 4.1).
The above sentences are simply examples of basic intransitive
sentences which are capable of being expanded in a variety of
ways.
Stative Sentence. Stative sentences are sentences that do not have
a verb in the predicate. The predicate may consist of a noun or
modifier that does not have any verbalizing affix (cf. 4.5). The
following are examples of stative sentences:
      Predicate           Subject
      Mediku              si Juan.
      Ma'estro            gue'.
      Manmediku           i lalahi.
      Manma'estro         siha.
      Dankolo             i patgon.
      Dikike'             i ga'ga'.
      Malingu             i guaka.
      Malangu             i mediku.
      Hafkao              bidada-mu.
SYNTAX                                                                      239            (Some linguists prefer to call the predicate of a stative sentence a
            comment and the subject a topic. Thus, a stative sentence could
            be described as a sentence consisting of a verbless comment and a
            topic about which the comment is made.)
                 When a verbalizing affix (such as -um- or man-) is added to
            the predicate of a stative sentence, it then becomes an intransitive
            sentence. The reason for claiming this change in status is that an
            intransitive sentence can take a modifier of manner while a stative
            sentence cannot.
            Existential Sentence. The term existential sentence is used to cover
            those sentences which describe the existence or nonexistence of
            something. The verbs that occur in the existential sentences are
            included among the irregular verbs in section 3.3.2. The irregular
            verbs that are generally found in existential sentences are gaige,
            estaba, guaha, taigue, taya',gai, and tai. Some sample existential
            sentences are given here:
                   Gaige yo' gi eskuela.
                   Estaba yo' gi eskuela.
                   Guaha salape'-hu.
                   Taigue i estudiante.
                   Taya' salape'-hu.
                   Gai salape' yo'.
                   Tai salape' yo'.
                   I desehu taya' bali-ria.
                   I desehu gai bali.
                 This concludes the present discussion of the four basic sen-
            tence types in Chamorro. There are undoubtedly other basic
            sentences that do not fit the four basic patterns given here. Never-
            theless, it is felt that most sentences in Chamorro can be derived
            from one of these four basic sentence types.
                 Try going back to the short text given at the beginning of this
            section to see if you can identify the sentence types used in that
            passage. Remember that most of the sentences used there (and in
            our daily speech) are derived sentences. That is, we use sentences
            in our regular communication that have been derived through
            transformations of basic sentence types.","[249, 250, 251]"
"10. Spelling of Borrowed W o r d s .

       When the pronunciation of consonants changes due to affixation,
       the spelling will be changed accordingly to represent the change in
       pronunciation. Most of the changes in consonants are caused by
       the affixation of the prefix man-, as in the following examples:
             man + po'lo     - • mamo'lo      to put
             man + tana'     —> manana'       to taste
             man + kati      -» mangati       to cry
             man + saga      —» managa        to stay
             man + gupu      —» manggupu      to fly       The pronunciation of the first person singular possessive pronoun
       hu is determined by the stem to which it is attached. For example,
       it is pronounced tu when it follows a stem ending with t, as in
       [pachot-tu], 'my mouth.' It is pronounced su when it follows a
       stem ending with s, as in [lassas-su] 'my skin'. And it is pro-
       nounced ku when it follows a stem that ends with a vowel preceded
       by two consonants, as in [lepblo-ku] 'my book'. For purposes of
       spelling, hu and ku only will be used, ku will be used for spelling
       when that pronunciation is normal; hu will be used elsewhere.
       12. Excrescent Consonants.
       When additional consonants are added through affixation, they
       will be represented in the spelling system. The following are
       examples of excrescent consonants:
             lepblo + mami —» lepblon-mami               our book
             saga + riaihon —• sagannaihon               stay for a while
             hanao + iyi    —• hanaguiyi                 go for someone       13. Superfluous Consonants.
       When the pronunciation of the consonant ng is predictable (i.e.,
       before k), it will not be written. Instead, only n will be written,
       as in the following examples:
             dankolo          big
             enkatgao         caretaker
             denkot           peck at       14. Geminate Consonants and Syllable-final h.
       Although the pronunciation of geminate consonants and syllable-
                       THE SOUND SYSTEM             OF   CHAMORROfinal h varies among different speakers of Chamorro (younger
Guamanians and people from Rota tend to omit them), they will
be included in the spelling. The authoratative spelling of such
words will be based on the standard pronunciation of mature
speakers from Guam and Saipan. Some example words are:      tommo             knee
      laggua            parrot fish
      fatto             come

      sahnge            strange
      mamahlao          be bashful15. Fronting of Vowels.
When the pronunciation of a vowel is changed due to vowel
fronting, this change will be reflected in the spelling, as in the
following examples:      foggon        i feggon       the stove
      guma'         i gima'        the house
16. Raising of Vowels.
When the pronunciation of a vowel is changed due to vowel
raising, the change in pronunciation will be reflected in the
spelling, as in the following examples:
      fugo'           fugu'i          squeeze for
      kuentos         kuentusi        speak to

      tatte           tattiyi         return for17. Free Words.
All content words (""adjectives, verbs, nouns"") will be written as
separate words in Chamorro. Some examples of content words
are:      kareta            car
      dankolo           big
      fugo'             squeeze
      fata'chong        sit downThe folio wing/unc/io« words (articles, affixes, etc.) will be written

19. Suffixes.
The following list contains the suffixes of Chamorro which will
be written as part of the word to which they are attached. (The
first item of the list is a discontinuous affix which may be con-
sidered part prefix and part suffix. It is called ""discontinuous""
because the stem comes in between the two parts of the affix.)      f a n . . . an(yan)    fanbinaduyan         place of deer
      -on                    guasa'on             sharpener
      -i/-iyi                sangani/sanganiyi    tell to/for
      -ñaihon                saganñaihon          stay for a while
      -guan                  pinalakse'guan       slip of the tongue
      -ña                    bunitaña             prettier20. Clitics.
Because of the special relationship that the possessive pronouns
have with the stems to which they are related, they will be attached
by hyphens, as in the following examples. They are called ""clitics""
rather than suffixes in order to show this close relationship.
      relos-hu               my watch
      relos-mu               your (sg.) watch
      relos-ña               his/her watch
      relos-ta               our (incl.) watch
      relos-mami             our (excl.) watch
      relos-miyu             your (pi.) watch
      relos-ñiha             their watch21. Reduplication and Infixes.
Reduplicated syllables and infixes will be written as part of the
word even though the resulting words may contain an unusually
large number of letters. Words will be divided on the basis of the
rules presented in this paper, not on the basis of length. Some
examples of long words resulting from multiple affixation and
reduplication are given here:
THE SOUND SYSTEM           OF CHAMORRO                                           67                manachachama' a' iiao

                manmangguaguaiya              This concludes the general spelling rules for the Chamorro
          language as adopted by the Marianas Orthography Committee
          in Saipan, M.I., January 21, 1971.","[74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79]"
"      Gi is also used with words pertaining to time. In some cases,
it is not translatable at all.
      Matto gue' gi painge.
      'He came last night.'
      Para bai hu fatto gi ega'an.
      'I will come in the morning.'
      Kasi gi oran alas sais.
      'Around six o'clock.'",[132]
"     The common articles of Chamorro are i, ni, and nu. A com-
plete explanation of their usage will not be possible without going
into the Focus System which will be discussed in a later section
under Syntax. The present discussion will be a preliminary one.
     The article i is very similar in both usage and meaning to the
English article the, although it is not always translated. The
Chamorro article i could be considered a ""definite"" article be-
cause it marks a definite or specific noun. Some examples of the
article i are:      Hu li'e' i patgon.
      'I saw the child.'
      I patgon ha hatsa i lamasa.
      'The child lifted the table.'
      Magof 2 korason-hu.
      'My heart is happy.'
      Si Don Jose umasagua yan i palao'an.
      'Don Jose married the woman.'
      I dadalak ^ babui
      'The pig's tail'Notice that the Chamorro article /' is not always translated into
English.
     The article i sometimes functions as a nominalizer, which
means that it can cause a verb or modifier to function like a noun.
See the following examples:

              ma'pos        'past'         i ma'pos     'the departed (one)'

              gumugupu      'flying'       i gumugupu   'the flyer'              N O T E : The vowels of munhayan and gumugupu are not fronted
              when preceded by i; vowel fronting (cf. 2.7.3) occurs only with
              vowels of the stem. The u of both munhayan and gumugupu is
              part of an affix, and therefore does not get fronted.","[144, 145]"
"            The relationship between pitch and streess in Chamorro is
       unique as far as this writer knows. There may be other languages
       in which loud stress is accompanied by low pitch as it is in Cha-
       morro, but if there are, I have not heard of them. It is this rela-
       tionship between pitch and stress in Chamorro that gives the lan-
       guage its own unique ""accent.""
                               THE SOUND            SYSTEM      OF       CHAMORROPitch Patterns in Phrases. Since the pitch patterns in C h a m o r r o
are largely determined by the occurrences of primary stress, the
pitch patterns found in phrases are for the most part predictable.
In isolated words primary stress is accompanied by low pitch
level (level 1). Secondary and weak stress carry the higher pitch
level (level 2). Special emphasis and questions can be produced
by using the extra high pitch (level 3). In continuous speech—
phrases and longer sequences—primary stress is accompanied
by pitch level 1. The pitch level rises to 2 or 3 in the syllables
following stress and remains there until the next juncture or the
next primary stress. Some examples follow:      / 1 és 2 te   es'tór^an    un 1 táo 2 tao/
           this is the story of a man
      / 2 kume 1 kwén 2 tos i        'pa 2 le' ha fa 1 fái 2 sen i 1 táo 2 tao/
            talked         the        priest asking              the man
      / 2 hu   1
                   tú 2 ngo'   l 2
                                á yu na      1
                                                 pát 2 gon/
          I        knew          that            child
      / 1 gwá 2 ha nai gwaha         chi 1 pá 2 ña/
          sometimes he has           cigarettesIn the last example, one could also put primary stress on the
second occurrence of /gwáha/, in which case there would be an
additional fall and rise in pitch caused by the additional primary
stress in the phrase.
     This suggests that the rule governing the relationship between
primary stress and low pitch is a highly regular rule. However, in
continuous rapid speech a speaker may choose not to give primary
stress to every syllable where it might be possible.
     The usual stress-pitch relationship found in C h a m o r r o is
distorted by loan words from Spanish and English. For example,
such words as /asút/ 'blue', /okasión/ 'occasion', and /idát/
'age' carry primary stress and high pitch on the final syllable.
The above words would be transcribed as follows when we
include the pitch levels:      lxa2sút/,          /'okasión/,         /M2dát/.","[57, 58]"
"         Comparative. Another type of construction that should be included
         as a type of modification is the comparative structure. This is used
         when one of the things being compared possesses a certain quality
         to a greater extent than another thing. When the two things that
         are being compared are included in the statement there are two
         morphemes in the construction. They are the suffix -na and the
         word kinu or ki. Since they do not occur together they are called
         discontinuous morphemes. The following sentences will illustrate:               Metgotna yo' kinu hagu.
               'I am stronger than you.'
               Dikike'na si Rosa kinu si Rita.
               'Rosa is smaller than Rita.'
               Chaddekna hao chumocho kinu guahu.
               'You are faster at eating than I am.'
         Quite often the second item in the comparative construction is
         omitted when the thing that is being compared is obvious. See the
         following examples:
               Ga'o-na i Jeep sa' metgotna.
               'He prefers the Jeep because it is stronger.'
               Ga'o-ku este na guma' sa' dankolona.
               'I prefer this house because it is bigger.'

4.3   The term nominalization is used to describe the process whereby
       a word, a phrase, or even a sentence can be made to function like
      a noun.
           Earlier in the section on nouns (3.3.3) some general rules
      were given on the identification of nouns. The first rule is that if
      a word occupies a position in the sentence that can be designated
      ""subject of sentence"" or ""object of sentence,"" it can then be
      classed as a noun. It is also possible, of course, to find a phrase
      or even a sentence functioning as the subject or object of a sen-
      tence. When this happens, we can say that the phrase or sentence
      has been nominalized.
           We might also expand the functions of the nominalized forms
      to include the following: indirect object of the verb, object of
      preposition, and object complement.
           In Section 3.3.5 on Changing Parts of Speech it was shown
      how various types of words can be changed through affixation
      to function like nouns. When a word has been changed to a noun,
      we can say that if has been nominalized. These processes will be
      reviewed briefly here. The root word used here is konne' 'to catch'.","[229, 230]"
"           T h e _yo'-type p r o n o u n s should be considered object p r o n o u n s
       when they occur with a Class I (transitive) word as a specific
       object. See the following e x a m p l e s :
       MORPHOLOGY:                   WORDS     AND THEIR       STRUCTURE      Si Juan ha li'e' yo'.
      'Juan saw me.'
      Si Maria ha hatsa gue'.
      'Maria lifted him.'
      I lahi ha sangani ham.
      'The man told us.'
      Like the other pronouns, the plural pronouns of the yo'-type
can be either dual or plural depending on the form of the verb.
      The possessive pronouns usually have the function that the
name suggests; that is, they usually indicate possession of the
noun to which they are attached. The possessive pronouns are
listed here:
                         1st           -hu       'my'
      Singular           2nd           -mu       'your'
                         3rd           -ña       'his, hers'
                         1st incl.     -ta       'our inclusive'
      Plural             1st excl.     -mami     'our exclusive'
                         2nd           -miyu     'your—2 or more'
                         3rd           -ñiha     'their—2 or more'
     All of the possessive pronouns are written here with hyphens
preceding them. This is a writing device to show that the posses-
sive pronouns are bound morphemes—they must always be
attached to the preceding word.
     In section 2.6.2. on Phrase Stress, it was pointed out that the
favored stress pattern in Chamorro was penultimate—on the
next to final syllable. The addition of the possessive pronoun to a
Chamorro word nearly always causes a shift in the primary
stress to the penultimate syllable. For this reason, the possessive
pronouns are sometimes referred to as enclitics, which are words
that are pronounced as forming a phonetic unit with the stressed
word preceding it.
     Notice how the primary stress shifts to the penultimate
syllable in the following examples:
      kareta     'car'         kareta-hu        'my car'
      kareta     'car'         kareta-ta        'our car'
      kareta     'car'         karetan-mami     'our car'
      kareta     'car'         karetan-niha     'their car'    It will also be noticed that all of the disyllabic possessive
pronouns (those with two syllables) require the excrescent con-
sonant n before they are joined to a vowel-final stem. (Cf. 2.7.2.)
MORPHOLOGY:      WORDS      AND THEIR       STRUCTURE                     109           The possessive pronouns do not always show possession.
       With certain verbs and in certain grammatical constructions they
       appear to function more like subject pronouns. For example,
       the words of Class IIIc (cf. 3.3.2) must always take the possessive
       pronoun as the subject:
              Ilek-hu ""never.""
              'I said ""never"".'
              Ga'o-mu este.
              'You prefer this.'
              Ya-hu humanao.
              'I want to go.'","[119, 120, 121]"
