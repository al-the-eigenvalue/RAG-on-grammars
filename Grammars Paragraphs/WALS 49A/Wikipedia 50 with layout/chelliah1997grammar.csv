"3.5 EncliticsVerbs, nouns and noun phrases, subordinate sentences, and root sentences can
be affixed by enclitics. These enclitics, described in detail in section 7.3, signal
meanings such as interrogative mood, inclusiveness/exclusiveness, the attitude
of the speaker towards a proposition or place the constituent in a larger dis-
course context (such as marking a constituent as shared information). Inter-
rogative sentences are signalled by an interrogative enclitic that occurs with a
noun, noun phrase or nominalized clause. Other sentence types, such as the
imperative and declarative, are formed through suffixation of inflectional mark-
ers to verbs. Details are given in Chapter 5.
                             Chapter 4
           Grammatical relations and information structureIn this chapter I discuss how grammatical relations are indicated in Meithei
and what the role of morphological case marking is in indicating these rela-
tions. As in many related languages, such as Lahu (Matisoff 1973b) and Lisu
(Hope 1974, Li and Thompson 1976), no reference is made in Meithei syntax
to the relations Subject, Agent and Object.28 Instead, Meithei is what Dixon
(1991, 1994) refers to as a ""pure"" language, where noun phrases are marked
according to their semantic role in a given instance of use of a verb. In terms
of Foley and Van Valin's (1984: 124) classification of inter-clausal syntax, Meit-
hei is not a ""reference-dominated"" language where distinctions between gram-
matical relations and semantic roles are significant, but a ""role-dominated""
language, where such distinctions are not.
   I provide evidence that notions such as subject and object are not necessary
in the description of Meithei clause structure. I show how verbs in Meithei
subcategorize for argument(s) with a specific semantic role indicated through
morphological marking. I also show how surface morphological marking is
often obscured through the overlay of a system of pragmatic marking which
deletes or replaces semantic role markers with pragmatic markers, and/or
manipulates word order for pragmatic effect. I will then describe how mor-
phological case markers indicate the case of peripheral noun phrases.","[118, 119]"

7.2.1 Inflectional morphologyThe sole nominal inflectional category is case marking. The category is highly
productive formally and semantically. Table 8 shows the paradigmatic nature
of case marking.79Table 8. Inflectional paradigm of ηιιρά 'male child'inflectional affix                 root-na 'agentive/instrumental'        nupana      'by the boy'
•pu 'accusative'                   nupabu      'the boy (patient)'
-td 'locative'                     nupada      'at/to the boy'
•tegi 'ablative'                   nupadagi    'from the boy'
-ki 'genitive'                     nupagi      'of the boy'
- t o 'associative'                nupaga      'with the boy'
244     Chapter 7. Affixal morphologyAlthough case markers are functionally inflectional, they exhibit the clitic-like
characteristic of docking at the edge of a phrase. Compare for example (19a-
c).(17) a. nupigine     'of the female, you know'
     b. nupi snigine 'of the two females, you know'      c. nupi               mdcä           dnigine
         nu       -pi       ma -cä         a        -ni -ki     -ne
         person -FEM NM -small             ATT      -two -GEN   -SI
         female             small          of two, you know
         'of the two girls, you know'In (17a) the genitive is suffixed directly on the noun but in (17b,c), where a
numeral and adjective are added to the noun phrase, the case marker must be
suffixed at the right edge of the phrase and not to the noun. Like clitics, case
markers are promiscuous with regard to the lexical category with which they
can occur: in Chapter 4 and 6, examples of case markers with nouns, noun
phrases, relative clauses and adverbial clauses were discussed. Thus case
markers function as inflectional endings but operate formally as clitics.","[269, 270]"

3.3 Major lexical categoriesIn this section I will discuss the lexical categories which participate in the
phrase structure described so far. I distinguish between an ""actual"" and a
""potential"" lexicon for Meithei.20 The actual lexicon consists of an unordered
list of underived roots and affixes and lexicalized forms. Each lexical entry in
the actual lexicon consists of specifications about the phonological shape of the
lexical item, what lexical category it belongs to and what its meaning is. On
the other hand, the output of the potential lexicon consists of words created
through productive morphological processes.
   In the actual lexicon, roots may be bound (those that must be affixed by
further morphology to be free-standing forms) or free. Nouns and verbs from
the actual lexicon can be distinguished on formal grounds in that bound roots
are verbs and free roots are nouns. They can further be distinguished since
the inflectional and derivational possibilities for each of these classes come
from affixes that belong to mutually exclusive sets (see Chapter 7). In the
potential lexicon, adjectives, adverbs and nominal forms can be derived from
verb roots and stative verbs can be derived from noun roots.
78         Chapter 3. Grammatical preview3.3.1     Nouns
Nouns can be distinguished from other lexical categories on morphological
grounds. For example, nouns but not verbs can be suffixed by gender, number
or case markers. Proper nouns and common nouns are free standing forms. A
large number of nouns are borrowed from Assamese, Bengali, English and
Hindi. A sample of these is given in Appendix 1.","[103, 104]"
"I assume that -pu is not the patient case marker in (24). Of course, there are
languages where both the case or semantic role and the pragmatic value of an
argument is signalled by the same marker (for example, the Japanese accu-
sative doubles up as an emphatic marker (Bloch 1969: 52)). Although it is
most probably the case in Meithei that the adversative marker -pu is derived
from the patient marker -pu, there are two pieces of evidence that in synchro-
nic grammar these are two distinct homophonous markers. First, adversative -
pu may be attached to a nonpatient noun phrase as in (24a-d); second, -pu can
occur twice in a noun phrase, once as the patient marker, and once as a prag-
matic marker as in (24e).43

genitive marker and in (24g) with the associative marker. See section 4.4 for
case marking with peripheral arguments.      f. magibu                   soydarabadi

120       Chapter 4. Grammatical relations and information structure4.3.4   Word order and      ambiguity
Word order also encodes pragmatic information in Meithei. Arguments may
be moved to post-verbal position (reminiscent of right dislocation in French,
English and elsewhere, sometimes called an afterthought) in order to reintro-
duce given information that has not been talked about for a while. This is
illustrated in (25a).( 2 5 ) a . haybzday                      kappe             Sakuntdlase

4.3.6 VolitionalityA final fact needs to be addressed: all descriptions of Meithei postulate a
nominative case -na, obliterating the important distinction between the agentive
-na, which does mark case, and the homophonous contrastive marker -nd which
does not. The reason for this is that traditional grammars, which are written
either on the pattern of Sanskrit or Latin, expect a predictable case paradigm.
Educated native speakers consistently insert the purported nominative case
marker -nd on actor arguments in elicitation. This is an artifact of traditional
grammars since -nd does not occur in texts with more frequency than any of
the other pragmatic markers discussed in this section.
   Recent descriptions such as Bhat and Ningomba (1986b), building on native
scholars' interpretation of Meithei grammar rather than on textual material,
also believe that there is a nominative case marker in Meithei, simply noting
that -nd is optional in sentences with noncausative verbs and that it can be
used on non-actor arguments. Bhat (1991) does address the optionality issue
by saying that -nd is used only when the action of the actor is volitional; how-
ever, it is easy to find sentences where this is not true. For example, in (27),
the -na marked actor refers to a daughter-in-law drowning (quite unintentional-
ly) in a pond. It is also possible to find sentences where the subject does exer-
cise control over an activity but is not marked by -nd (see (26d) above).(27)    mdnäw            nupind                       ptikhndd

3.4.2 PostpositionsTwo postpositions occur with singular pronouns: -hdk 'at', which indicates an
actor that is near the place of speech and -ijonda 'to' which refers to a goal
that is distant from the speech event or the source of action. The probable
source for ηόη is what DeLancey (1984: 62) calls a locative noun. He notes
that locative nouns often function as dative or locative postpositions; for exam-
ple, ηαη 'interior' in Tibetan, is used to mean 'inside'. This Tibetan form, natj,
as well as Hayu ηοη 'locative' and Nocte ηαη 'locative, dative/ accusative', are
obviously cognate with Meithei -ijonda, which is most likely a lexicalization of a
locative noun ·ηόη and the locative marker -ta. The origin of -hdk might be
hdk which is a productive stem in Meithei meaning 'body', as in hdkthaij 'co-
nfidant' where hdk is compounded with the stem thatj 'near', -hdk or -noqda
may be used with the first person singular pronoun to indicate the amount of
control the speaker has over the action expressed by the verb: when -hdk is
used the speaker is pointing out the inclusion of self in current activity; when
-ijonda is used the speaker indicates that he/she is undergoing some action that
is not under his/her control.

         that book         to me          not give
         'That book was not given to me.'   -hdk is commonly omitted in casual speech styles but is used in the written
language and in more formal speech styles (N. Promodini Devi 1989: 22). The
forms nahdk and mdhdk, rather than the bare pronouns, are considered 'more
polite' probably since they are associated with written and formal speech styles.
According to N. Promodini Devi, it is possible for a speaker to utilize the
choice between a bare pronoun form and a pronoun marked with -hdk, reflec-
ting a semantics for pronouns much like that described for French, German
and Italian in Brown and Gilman (1960). For example, nshdk may be used to
indicate the speaker's respect or social distance with the addressee whereas
η9η may be used to indicate the speaker's disrespect or intimacy with the ad-
dressee. This accounts for why -hdk is often described as an honorific or a
marker of respect (Ch. Yashawanta Singh 1984 and P. Madhubala Devi 1979,
among others), however, I do not adopt this analysis since -hdk also occurs
with the first person pronoun.","[116, 117]"
"
   If the Binding theory is valid for languages that exhibit an asymmetry be-
tween subject and object position, it follows that in languages that do not ex-
hibit this asymmetry, anaphors and pronominals will not necessarily have the
same structural relationship with their antecedents. Using examples (4f-i), I
will show that this is the case in Meithei.
  In Meithei a pronominal may be co-indexed to a noun phrase in the same
clause. In (4f), just as in English, the pronoun mdbu 'him' must be free: it can
either refer to Tomba or have an arbitrary reference but it cannot refer to
Raju.

4.1.8 Lack of agreementMany languages might exhibit person, number or gender agreement between
the verb and the subject, giving the subject noun phrase, as opposed to other
arguments of the verb, a special status. This test for subjecthood is also not
possible in Meithei since there are no person, number or gender agreement
phenomena between the verb and its arguments.

claim is that: (1) there are no rules which specifically refer to the verb phrase
constituent, (2) there is no adjacency requirement between the verb and its
arguments, (3) there is no restriction on omission of arguments in comple-
ments, (4) arguments in nominalization are not singled out for special case
marking, (5) the semantic role of the understood argument of imperative and
imperative-like sentences is not restricted, and (6) the distribution of prono-
minals and anaphors shows that Meithei is structurally different from languages
where principles stated in Binding theory are applicable.","[132, 133]"
"1.8 Review of literature on the Meithei languageIn general the inaccessibility of Northeast India to foreign and Indian scholars
has made the documentation of Tibeto-Burman languages spoken there diffi-
12      Chapter 1. Introduction cult. This has not been the case with Meithei, about which much has been
written. Existing works can be divided into four categories.
   The first is the practical grammars of British missionaries/ administrators, the
most important of which are Primrose (1887, 100 pages) and Pettigrew (1912,
 111 pages), who provide useful word lists, conversational sentences and list of
idioms which cannot be found elsewhere. Pettigrew is especially insightful with
regards to the verb morphology. However, neither of these works is exhaus-
tive: much of the affixal morphology is not described, tones are not marked or
described in any detail, textual information is not used, and there is little to no
description of the syntax.
   Second, there are a number of pedagogical works on Meithei written in
Meithei or English, and a new grammar comes out almost every year. Since
these are written on the model of Sanskrit grammar, certain grammatical rela-
tions such as evidentiality are ignored and other grammatical categories are
postulated where they do not exist. (Subjects are claimed to be marked by
nominative case, for example). These works are useful, however, in that they
provide lists of bound roots, sentences, compounds and the like, as well as
insights into language use. The reader should refer to the References section
for titles and authors of such pedagogical works.
   Third, there is the body of literature by native speaking Meithei linguists
which, by 1990, consisted of 27 Master's theses and Ph.D. dissertations. Not-
able is Thoudam's 1980 Ph.D dissertation which provides a comprehensive
description of Meithei phonology. Sushila Ningthongjam's 1982 Master's thesis
on Meithei morphology includes a near exhaustive list of verbal and nominal
affixes in Meithei with examples. Nongthombam Nonigopal Singh's 1987 Ph.D.
dissertation on Meithei affixal morphology provides appendices with lists of
compounds, roots and examples of words that have from one to ten affixes.
   Finally, there is the work of non-Meithei linguists or anthropologists writing
in Hindi and English, such as Grierson from the Linguistic Survey of India
(1903-1928), Hodson (1908) and more recently D.N.S. Bhat and his consultant
and co-author M.S. Ningomba. The work of Bhat and Ningomba (1986a,
1986b) and Bhat (1991) has been the most influential work on Meithei since
Thoudam's (1980) Ph.D. dissertation. The topics covered are word formation,
the case system, tense, and aspect and directionals. Tones are not marked or
described. Some of the data and resulting conclusions are unreliable since
elicited data have been used and results have not been checked with naturally
occurring speech (for more details, see Chapter 4).
   During my trips to Manipur, I collected published and unpublished works on
Meithei from the Manipur University Linguistics Department and main library,
from research scholars working on Meithei dialects, and from book stores in
Imphal and Delhi. Works written in Meithei or Hindi were translated with the

of this book.","[37, 38, 39]"

Significantly, the binding relationship is not symmetric since the subject posi-
tion c-commands the object position but the object position does not c-com-
mand the subject position. So (4a) is grammatical because the anaphor is
bound in its governing category; (4b) is ungrammatical because the anaphor
binds the antecedent not vice versa and (4c) is ungrammatical because there is
no antecedent in the governing category of the anaphor to bind it; that is, the
intended antecedent is too far away.
   Consider also (4d) and (4e): (4d) shows that a pronominal noun phrase, in
this case the pronoun him, cannot be coreferential with a noun phrase in the
same clause. In Binding theory this is expressed as the principle that a prono-
minal must be free in its governing category. Thus (4e) is grammatical where-
as (4d) is not since in (4e) the pronominal is not co-indexed with a noun
phrase in the same clause.

4.5 ConclusionIn this chapter I have shown that Meithei exhibits a flat phrase structure. The
grammatical status of the arguments that a predicate subcategorizes for is
indicated through semantic role markers which can be manipulated through a
system of pragmatic marking. In the default case the correct interpretation of
the status of arguments in a Meithei sentence can be read off of semantic role
markers and the observance of an animacy hierarchy. Since, however, the
pragmatics can delete and/or replace these markers, interpretation involves a
knowledge of the pragmatic marking system (meaning of overt pragmatic mar-
kers, conditions under which semantic role markers can be deleted, word order
and stress). To some extent the pragmatic system makes recovery of grammat-
ical relations difficult so that sentences may often have more than one inter-
pretation. In these cases the larger discourse context must be used to recover
the intended meaning.

patterns of subordination.
   Basic sentence types in Meithei are determined through illocutionary mood
markers, all of which are verbal inflectional suffixes, with the exception of the
interrogative which is an enclitic. The morphemes and the sentence types they
signal are listed in Table 1. The basic word order is the same for all root
sentence types (see phrase structure rules in Chapter 3).","[155, 156, 157]"

by the locative or the associative. In these instances, the meaning of the case
markers is compositional.(30)    c. migigd                      sygigB                   manatee

(see section 5.6) which may be followed by -su 'also' (as in 10a,b) or the se-
quence kumbd composed of -kum 'like, kind of and -pd 'nominalizer' (see 10c).(10) a. karisu       b. kdnasu           c.    kdngumba

an indefinite article: this is seen in (lOd) with a verbal question word (i.e. a
question word suffixed by the inquisitive marker -no, see Chapter 6). (lOd)
can be opposed to (lOe): in (lOd) the pronoun refers to a specific person who
is seen but not identified, whereas (lOe) refers to an non-specific entity whose
presence can only be inferred (through the result of some action, for example).(10) d. kananomd                 e.      kdnagumbd                  ama

phology that can follow indefinite pronouns: the question word-numeral or
question word-enclitic-numeral sequence may be suffixed by the verbal negative
marker -ta (see lOf, g). The resulting form is apparently a noun since it may
be further suffixed by a case marker (see 10h). The negative marker cannot
be affixed to other nouns.(10) f. kdnamstd          g. ksrimaPa                 h.    kdnamsPadd

3.3.1.3 Pronouns: relativeAs noted in section 3.3 the strategy for creating relative clauses in Meithei is to
place the relativized noun directly after a nominalized clause; there is no rela-
tive pronoun to mark the relative clause. An additional but rarely exploited
strategy for creating a relative clause involves using a question word as a rela-

his argument that Meithei does not have an external argument. I am not sure
how this supports his thesis since the phenomenon of long-distance reflexives
also occurs in languages with subjects (e.g Dutch, German and Russian (Van
Riemsdijk and Williams 1986: 283).
   To restate the point being made in this section: languages with a clause
structure similar to English exhibit restrictions concerning pronominals and
anaphors as stated by the Binding theory. Since Meithei does not have the
same clause structure as English, the Binding theory does not make the appro-
priate predictions for Meithei anaphora.

of extracting from subject position is more restricted than from object position.
Thus, as illustrated in the following English examples taken from Kiss (1988),
where it is possible to question an object from the complement (9a) but not
the subject (9b).(9)   a. WhOi did you say that they called in e{ first?
      b. *Whoi did you say that et went in first?32   In Meithei, however, it is possible to question either argument of a subordi-
nate clause. Thus in (9c) the goal is questioned and in (9d) the theme is ques-
tioned.(9)   c. natjna     puthorskkani

104     Chapter 4. Grammatical relations and information structure4.1.6 Subjects in imperative constructionsTypically imperative constructions require a 2nd person actor. Thus in the
English sentence Wash!, a second person actor is the understood subject. The
person of the patient argument, however, is not restricted. In this way, the
subject is given special status with regard to its semantic role and person in
imperative constructions.
  In Meithei, a verb with imperative inflection may subcategorize for an actor
argument; in this case the actor must refer to second person. Thus, the actors
in (9e) are possible but the first person actors in (9f) are not.33(9)   e. n9η / ndkhoy         cak       cdnu
         naq / πθ -khoy cäk             cä   -nu

         'You/ you all don't eat rice!'      f. *aykhoyl     *3yl*mdl*m3khoy       cdk cdnu

         we          I he/she/ they     rice    eat
         'Don't eat rice'  Unlike English, however, the semantic role of the understood or omitted
argument is not restricted to actors. For example in (9g-i) the argument is a
patient.(9)   g. pdtlu
         pat    -u

   Meithei has two other imperative like constructions: supplicatives, with which
a speaker pleads a course of action where the speaker will be participant (best
translated as 'Let us V'); and permissives, where the speaker grants permission
for some 2nd or 3rd person to carry out some action. First, there is no restric-
tion on the person of the actor argument in such constructions. For example,
although supplicatives usually have 1st person plural actors, a 1st person sin-
gular actor is also possible when the construction occurs as an embedded in-
direct question, with the meaning Ί was wondering whether I should V'.(9)   j. ama         cdsira          ani     casira

4.4 Case marking on peripheral noun phrasesNoun phrases that are not needed to fulfill the argument structure of a verb
may appear with one of the following case markers: locative -ta, instrumental
-na, associative -ka and ablative -tagi. In this section, I will describe and exem-
plify these case markers.",[151]

inflectional morphology but only by other enclitics. The copula has phrasal
scope so that it attaches phonologically to the rightmost constituent in a sen-
tence regardless of which constituent is at that edge (21a,b).86

4.2 Case markingClauses in Meithei are constructed of a verb and its arguments. I will first de-
scribe case marking on the core arguments that a verb subcategorizes for.
Case marking on peripheral arguments is discussed in section 4.4.
  As shown in Table 1, a verb may subcategorize for an agent, actor, experien-
cer/goal, patient, or theme argument. Table 1 also lists the enclitics used to
indicate a semantic role.",[133]
"This set of demonstrative pronouns can be suffixed by case markers like other
nouns. However, the meaning signalled by the resulting forms is idiosyncratic:
the proximate and distal meanings are lost and madu and masi act like sen-
tence adverbs or conjunctions. Table 2 gives a list of the most common forms
of the demonstrative pronouns with ma- found in my corpus and the meanings
they signal. Chapter 6 provides a discussion of the function of these pronouns
as clausal subordinators.",[108]

pan      'bank'             mapdn           'outside'
The meaning of a verb root is metaphorically extended when used as a locative
adverb. For example, the root khd 'south' is used to mean 'below' or 'under-
neath' in the corresponding locative adverb makhd. A representative list of
locative adverbs along with the roots they are derived from is given in Table 4.
88      Chapter 3. Grammatical preview  Temporal adverbs are frozen compounds. For example, ψ ύ 'today', η3Γαη
'yesterday' and hayeij 'tomorrow' are most likely bimorphemic although the
meaning of the individual roots is not clear. Similarly, although (16a) is not
considered bimorphemic by speakers, it is composed of recognizable Meithei
verb roots.(16) a. hawjik
        haw -cik
        begin -sever
        'now'   A limited number of verb roots undergo zero derivation to function as ad-
verbs and with this function appear as free forms. For example the verb hek
'pluck, pick' functions as an adverb to indicate 'just, precisely V\ In these
cases, I assume that there are two lexical listings in the actual lexicon for the
item hek, one as a verb and the other as an adverb.(16) b. hek layrakpani
        hek lay        -lak          -pa  -ni
        just buy       -DISTAL       -NOM -COP
        'just bought from there'  Adverbs may occur in a sequence in sentences. In this case, the order of
adverbs determines their semantic scope. This sequence must occur to the left
of the verb but does not necessarily have to be adjacent to the verb.(16) c. ay henna             yamna            cay
        ay hen         -na    yam -na         cä -i

inteijections. These are considered minor categories because these lexical
items are closed sets which express meanings most often encoded by affixal
morphology.","[113, 114, 115]"

4.1.7 Lack of passiveThere are certain tests for subjecthood which cannot be carried out in Meithei.
In languages like English, the passive construction singles out the subject for
special treatment: the subject of an active sentence appears as an oblique
argument in the passive counterpart. Since there is no passive construction in
Meithei, this type of singling out of an argument is not available.34 In fact,
the lack of passive in Meithei can be seen as a consequence of the fact that
the semantic roles that a verb subcategorizes for are fixed and cannot be ma-
nipulated by the syntax. This is the same conclusion that Kiss (1988: 34) ar-
rives at to explain the lack of passive in Hungarian, which she says, ""is a natu-
ral consequence of the fact that the target of nominative assignment is already
fixed ~ on a thematic basis ~ in the lexicon.""",[132]

gender, number and quantity. A noun may have one of 5 semantic roles:
agent, actor, patient, recipient/goal, theme. Actor and theme roles are not
indicated morphologically, while all other semantic roles are indicated by an
enclitic. For pragmatic effect, semantic role markers can be omitted or replac-
ed by enclitics which mark contrastiveness or definiteness. Peripheral argu-
ments may be suffixed by enclitics indicating ablative, genitive or associative
case. Finally, a noun may be prefixed by a pronominal prefix which indicates
its possessor. The Meithei noun has the structure given in Figure 2.(pronominal prefix) Root (Gender) (Number) (Quantifier) (Case)Figure 2. Schematic representation of Meithei noun morphologyAn noun phrase may consist of a noun followed by derivational and inflectional
morphology or of a noun and adjectives, numerals and/or quantifiers. The
order of these constituents within the noun phrase is relatively free.(2)   a. NP -* Ν (Adj*) (Num/Quant)As reflected in phrase structure rule (2a), an noun phrase may consist of either
a numeral or quantifier, but not both. Also, a noun phrase may consist of one
or more than one adjective. P. Madhubala Devi (1979: 157) provides (2b) to
show that up to three adjectives can occur in a noun phrase. Although in
theory this number can be extended ad infinitum, in natural speech it is rare
for more than one adjective to occur in a given noun phrase.

after the head noun. Thus in (2c) the ordinal can occur before and in (2d)

4.1.4 Pronominal and anaphoric coreferenceConsider the English sentences in (4a-c). These sentences show that a certain
structural relationship has to hold between himself and its antecedent. First,
the antecedent must precede the pronoun: (4a) is grammatical whereas (4b) is
not. Second, the pronoun must be ""within reach"" of the antecedent it is refe-
rentially linked to. Thus (4a), where the pronoun is in the same clause as its
antecedent, is grammatical but (4c), where the pronoun is in the complement,
is ungrammatical.(4)   a. John knows himself.
      b. *Himself John knows.
      c. *Johni thinks that Mary knows himself .
98      Chapter 4. Grammatical relations and information structure   These facts are expressed in the theory of Government and Binding (Chom-
sky 1982: 188) by binding principles which state, in part, that an anaphor must
be bound in its governing category. The term 'anaphor' refers to noun phrases
like himself or each other. We can assume for the point being made here that
the governing category of the pronominal is the minimal clause containing
it.30. In a structure as shown in Figure 1, the subject position is said to ""bind""
the object position because the antecedent and the pronominal are co-indexed
(referentially linked to each other) and because the subject position ""c-com-
mands"" the object position. C-command is defined by van Riemsdijk and Wil-
liams (1986: 142) as follows:C-command: A c-commands Β if and only if the first branching node domi-
           nating A also dominates Β and A does not itself dominate B.","[123, 124]"

3.3.1.1 Pronouns: personal and possessiveThe singular personal pronouns are ay Τ, naq 'you' and md 'he/she'. Posses-
sive pronouns are formed through the suffixation of -ki 'genitive' on these
personal pronouns: aygi/natjgi/magi    yum 'my/your/his or her house'. The
possessive pronominal prefixes ι-, na- and ma- are the first person, second
person and third person possessive prefixes, respectively. These may be affixed
to kinship terms or inalienably possessed nouns.(8)     a . imit    'my eye'
        b. nakhoq   'your foot'
        c. mapa     'his grandfather'
        d. mayum    'his house'21   The first person possessive prefix is more restricted in use than the second
or third person possessive prefixes since it appears only with kinship terms: so,
*iyum for 'my house' is ungrammatical but must be expressed as aygi yum.
There are also certain taboos on the use of the second person possessive with
kinship terms. N. Promodini Devi (1989a) reports that naqgi namd 'your
mother' is impolite; the socially acceptable form is the idiomatic sequence
natjgi imd which literally means 'your my mother'.
   The choice between the use of a prefixed noun, such as ipa 'my father', or
the genitive and the prefixed noun, such as aygi ipa 'my father', is determined
by discourse factors: ipa is used when the father being spoken about has al-
ready been the topic of the conversation, while aygi ipa is used at the first
mention of father. This use of the genitive and prefixed possessive is the only
evidence of pronominal agreement in Meithei.(9)     a . aygi                iraybak
           ay    -ki           i   -lay     -päk

"7.3.1 Determiners, semantic role and case markersAs discussed in section 3.3.1.4, the determiners si 'proximate' and tu 'distal' are
stems that function as enclitics. They exhibit the clitic-like characteristic of
docking at the edge of a phrase.(20) a. nupi               maca                    anisi

tion 7.2.2.2. Case markers occur only to the left of determiners: nupiduda 'to
that girl' but not *nupidadu.",[275]
"
6.3 Adverbial clausesAs represented in phrase structure rule in (11a), sentences may be modified by
adverbial clauses which occur in sentence initial position. Adverbial clauses
are subordinated sentences further suffixed by clausal subordinators (e.g. case
markers or lexical subordinators).(12) a. S          —      (AdvP) NP* V
        AdvP       —      S' CS
        AdvP              S quotative
6.3.1 Case markers as clausal subordinatorsClausal subordinators are derived from the locative, genitive, associative and
ablative case markers, following a pattern that is common in Tibeto-Burman
languages, as noted by Konow (1909: 9) and discussed in detail for 26 langua-
ges of the family in Genetti (1988).",[198]
"      The sentence literally means, 'Let's laugh, then where (am I)?, let's not
      laugh then where (am I)?'
77.   Out of nine speakers I questioned, five felt that this was a possible form
      but four felt it was unacceptable. The duplicated form of -khi 'still' adds
      a level of politeness to the sentence.      i.   naq cdk       cdkhikhinu
           naq cäk       cä         -khi       -khi           -nu
           you rice      eat        -STILL -STILL             -PROBH
           you rice      don't yet eat
           'Don't eat (until I can join you).'
508         Notes
      This form was originally noted in Ch. Yashawanta Singh (1984); however,
      when I checked the form with native speakers 2 out of 4 thought the
      form was ungrammatical, the other two saying such forms can be found
      in poetry or in the stylized language of plays.
78.   Also, nouns do not have a third level of derivation and do have a prefixal
      category that verbs do not.
79.   Pettigrew (1912: 14) also lists -sa which he calls vocative case. As seen in
      (i) and (ii) -sa additionally acts to pluralize the noun it is suffixed to. It
      cannot be suffixed on inanimate nouns: *layriksa; nouns which cannot
      substitute for proper names *huysa (hify 'dog'), *misa (mi 'man') or prop-
      er nouns *Tombasa.      There are no examples of this marker in my data
      and native speakers consider it to be archaic.      i.       3ηάψά

7.2 The noun morphologyThe noun in Meithei is composed minimally of a root. Suffixal categories are
derivational (gender and number) or inflectional (case). There is a prefixal
category which is non-category changing (possessive prefixes). Markers from
the same category cannot co-occur. Figure 2, a representation of the Meithei
noun, can be derived through the word structure rules in Table 7. Phrase
structure rules for nouns derived from verbs are given in section 6.1.",[268]
"The ablative may also indicate the source of transfer of material objects or
ideas.(29) b. dyna          mssi                          Bildagi           tdre

"Thus, discourse factors ~ such as the saliency of the first argument - favor
interpretation of the first argument as subject; however, this is not a categorical
rule in Meithei syntax.
  The disambiguation of the role of an argument is not a primary concern in
related languages either. In Burmese, marking of arguments follows similar
principles as in Meithei; for example, the semantic role or contrastive value of
a noun phrase determines what marking occurs on it (Johnson 1995, DeLancey
1995). Arguments can occur without any marking, but Johnson notes that the
idea of ""ambiguity avoidance"" is not the primary principle determining the use
or non-use of case markers. Rather, discourse factors like new topic (which
occurs with marking) or continuing topic (which is unmarked) are significant to
optionality of marking. See also Johnson (1992) and Wheatley (1982).
122     Chapter 4. Grammatical relations and information structure4.3.5 Restrictions on pragmatic markingSemantic role markers can be replaced by pragmatic markers with all predicate
types. Examples of where this occurs with state and two-argument predicates
are given in (19)-(25). Examples with three-argument predicates and causative
verbs are given in (26) and (27) respectively.(26) a. Tombadi                layriktu                nupasina

                                                4.3 Information   structure   123   When two or more arguments of a verb are human, they must be marked by
either semantic or pragmatic marking. Such a restriction, determined by num-
ber of and humanness of arguments, cannot be motivated by a grammatical
marking system where one would expect structurally determined rules, but is
well motivated when viewed in terms of interpretation. To facilitate interpreta-
tion the pragmatics require a minimum amount of information to differentiate
the status of arguments.
   In sentences with causative verbs, non-agent arguments may occur without
semantic role marking but must minimally be marked with pragmatic markers
(26e,f). Agent marking is usually not manipulated by the pragmatic marking
system, and if an agent is not omitted it will occur with its semantic role mark-
er. Sentences like (26g), however, are marignally acceptable if enough context
is provided: in this case, there might be a photo album open with a picture of
the agent being pointed out by the speaker.(26) e. Cawbana          3ηάηάιι        rjawhalhmmi

"50.   The quotative hdy 'say' is especially prone to being shortened or deleted,
      thereby causing the quotative to merge with the preceding word phono-
      logically. This process might involve the deletion of the initial laryngeal
      of the quotative as shown in examples (i) and (ii). Note that in (i) inter-
      vocalic r has also been deleted. The entire quotative may be deleted with

      form a question.

      -la. As seen in (10b), it may also be used independently. In such cases it
      is a polite imperative. See Chapter 9 for further discussion of the solici-
      tive marker.
53.   The question words have the following composition, kana 'who' contains
      -na, possibly the 'agentive', but it does not mark case any more as
      evidenced by the form kanana 'by whom', kdri 'what' contains -ri, the
      meaning of which is unknown, kaydaw 'doing what' contains kdri 'what'
      and taw 'do'; km becomes kay by a fast speech rule which has been
      lexicalized in question words, ksydawqay 'when (exact time/ day)'
      contains kdri 'what', taw 'do' and qay 'during'. 'How much, how many' is
      ksydm (for mass noun) which contains ydm 'lot' and kaya (for count
      nouns), karam 'how, in what way' contains lam 'path, way', karamba
      'which' contains lam 'path, way' and -pa 'nominalizer', kaday 'where'
      contains -tagi 'ablative' (-tagi becomes tay through a fast speech rule
      which in its lexicalized form becomes toy), kamdawna 'how do V' contains
      karam 'how', taw 'do' and -na 'instrumental', kamayna 'how' contains
      karam 'how' and hay 'say' and -na 'instrumental', kamdaw 'to what extent'
      contains karam 'how' and taw 'do', kadomda 'which way' contains som
      'side' and -ta 'dative', karigi 'why' is composed of kari 'what' and -ki
      'genitive but the expected meaning 'of what, from what or belonging to
      what' is not obtained. Possibly, karigi might can be translated as 'from
      what (cause)' thereby yielding the meaning of 'why'.
54.   The similarity between the solicitive -o and the inquisitive enclitic -no is
      apparent both in a segmental sense and from their meanings: both
      contain the segment -o and both soften the communicative force of the
      speech act they signal. It is probable that -no is the lexicalized com-
      bination of na 'be' and the solicitive marker. In the synchronic grammar
      -o affixes to verbs whereas -no affixes to nominal forms.
55.   Ch. Yashawanta Singh (1984: 179) states that kadawijay refers to an exact
      time but P. Madhubala Devi (1979: 219) differentiates kadawqay from
      karamkanda by stating that the first asks for an approximate time and
      that the second asks for a specific time.

58.   There are idiosyncratic instances where adjectives can be formed on non-
      state verb roots.      i.            dcdbd                       pot
                    a        -cä       -pa      pot
                    ATT      -eat      -NOM     thing
                    for eating                  thing
                    'something edible'59.   This is similar to the difference of meaning between post and prenominal
      adjectives in French. For example, the French un grand garqon means 'a
      grown-up boy' but un gargon grand means 'a tall boy'.
60.   These examples were reported to me by Th. Harimohon Singh whose
      source is Ch. Yashawanta Singh (p.c.).
61.   This sentence most probably indicates beginning of menstruation.
62.   The verb man 'seems' also functions to indicate mood, indicating a prob-
      ability based on indirect evidence, that some event or state has taken
      place or been attained. The verb occurs in the frozen expression
      oyrdmanne.      i.       cdhi dmsgi                            oyramanne
               cahi 9          -ma        -ki        oy - b      man        -ne

               'It seems it is going to go on for a year.'","[528, 529, 530]"
"Speakers recognize a slight semantic difference between postnominal and
prenominal adjectives. Postnominal adjectives are simply descriptive but pre-
nominal adjectives identify the modified noun as belonging to a class of similar
things.59
   The similarity between adjectives and relative clauses allows for the ambigu-
ity illustrated in (8d) which can mean 'the shop that sells old books' and has
the structure in (8e); or 'the old shop that sells books' and has the structure in
(δί).60(8)   d. Bmanbs        layrik yonbs                    dukandu

6.1.2.6 Combining relative clauses and coreferenceWhen two relative clauses refer to the same relativized noun phrase, the clau-
ses can be juxtaposed to indicate that they are conjoined. In this case the
relativized noun phrase appears once in the sentence.

6.5.4 Clausal coordinationFinite clauses can be related to each other through the use of coordinators
which are based on the pronoun adu 'that' and one of the oblique case mark-
ers. Corresponding forms with the proximate determiner -si do not appear as
coordinators. Each coordinator of the form determiner-case marker has a
specialized function.
   The coordinator aduda 'at that, because of that', composed of adu 'that' and
-ta 'locative', indicates a cause clause as in (22a).(22) a. niqthawgi          hdkthfy      haydu     oyramme

This is not the case with derivational morphology: as described in the section
7.1.1 to 7.1.3, there are selectional restrictions on the verb roots that deriva-
tional morphemes can be affixed to. The characterization of inflectional mor-
phology as productive is correct if we consider the productivity of the category
as a whole. Of course, certain inflectional paradigms may be ""defective"" (Aro-
noff 1976: 2), so that a particular inflectional morpheme may be unproductive
whereas the category it belongs to is productive. For example, the following
English data evidently argue against productivity as a defining characteristic of
inflection: the inflectional plural suffix -en in oxen is unproductive (does not
occur with all nouns), whereas the derivational agentive suffix -er as in baker is
highly productive. This does not mean that the category of plural is not fully
productive in English. We know that it is, since nearly all singular nouns have
a plural equivalent, but not all verbs can form a noun with -er.
   In Meithei, the formal productivity of inflectional morphology is complemen-
ted by its semantic productivity: the meanings signalled by the inflectional
morphology are regular, easier to predict than the meanings signalled by the
derivational morphemes which are often idiosyncratic.
   It is generally also expected (Greenberg 1966) that derivational morphology
occurs encompassed within inflectional morphology, so that derivational mor-
phology occurs closer to the root than inflectional morphology. Corresponding
to this in Meithei, the three categories which occur closest to the root have
been called derivational, and the fourth category farther out from the root,
inflectional.
204     Chapter 7. Affixal morphology
   Finally, it has been noted that the phonology closer to the root (the phonolo-
gy of derivational morphology) is less regular than the phonology further out
from the root (the phonology of inflectional morphology) (Sapir 1921). More
specifically, it has been observed that the phonological rules which apply on
derivational morphology have a more restricted environment of application
than phonological rules that apply on the inflectional morphology (Kiparsky
 1982). This is certainly true in Meithei where the categories of first, second
and third level derivational suffixes undergo lexical phonological rules and the
affixes in the inflectional category undergo only post-lexical rules (see Chapter
2 for details).
   It has been noted that derivational morphology has a tendency to consist of
borrowed or lexicalized forms (Bybee 1985). In Meithei, suffixes from first,
second and third level derivation have a diachronic relationship with a stem in
the language; that is, the suffix has been derived from the stem (see the right
hand column in Table 3). In this process of grammaticalization, the stem loses
its stem tone and the vowel of the stem may appear as s.
   All first level derivational suffixes are transparently related to stems; out of
the 16 second level derivational suffixes, 10 are related to stems, and out of 7
third level derivational suffixes, 3 are related to stems. Thus there is a cline,
where morphemes closer to the root are historically grammaticalized forms;
farther from the root there are fewer morphemes which are transparently
lexicalized equivalents of stems; and in the inflectional morphology there are
no morphemes derived from stems.
   The distinction between inflectional and derivational morphology is possible
and useful in describing the Meithei verb.66 Note, however, that derivational
morphology, defined as category changing morphology, is useful in charac-
terizing only a subset of all derivational morphemes. The category changing
morphemes are: the nominalizers -pd (see section 6.1), ma- and khu- (see
section 4.1.3), which derive nouns from verbs, and -ns which derives adverbs
from verbs (see section 3.3.2.2).","[229, 230]"

3.3.1.4 Pronouns: demonstrativeThe determiners -si 'proximate'23 and -tu 'distal' are stems that function as
enclitics, -si indicates that the object or person being spoken of is near or
currently seen or known to be near, even if not viewable by the speaker, or is
currently the topic of conversation; -tu signifies something or someone not
present at the time of speech or newly introduced in the conversation. There
are two pronouns based on these stems: sdu 'it (there)' and 3si 'it (here)'
where 3- is the attributive prefix. The determiner may occur either as an in-
dependent pronoun or encliticized on the noun phrase with no difference in
meaning (P. Madhubala Devi 1979: 158). Compare (11a) with ( l i b ) and (11c)
with (lid).(11)   a.    nupidu                       aygi                   marupni

4.4.5   Instrumental    case
The instrumental marker, indicates the noun phrase with which (32a) or
through which (32b,c) some action is performed. LaPolla (1994) points out
that in many Tibeto-Burman languages the instrumental and agentive markers
are homophonous. In his view, this may point to the instrumental marker
being used as an agentive marker through a metaphorical extension of its
primary meaning (a concept developed in DeLancey 1989a), leading to a dis-
tinct marker through grammaticalization of the extended use as an agentive.( 3 2 ) a. dyna          ίϊιάη   dmand                 haydu             khäy

100     Chapter 4. Grammatical relations and information structure  The Binding Theory states that anaphors are bound in their governing ca-
tegory. In Meithei there are three types of data where this is not the case: (1)
an antecedent can precede or follow the anaphor, (2) there are long distance
reflexives, and (3) emphatic reflexives are not bound.
  The c-command relationship does not hold between the anaphor and its
antecedent in (5b), (6b) and (7b) since the anaphor occurs before the noun
phrase and it is the anaphor that binds the noun phrase it is co-indexed with.(5)   a. Johnns             masdbu              uprammi

"7.2.2.1 Category 2: GenderNouns are not marked for grammatical gender. Semantic gender may be
indicated for animate beings by -pi 'female' and -pa 'male'.80 Thus in (18a)
the stem nu 'human' is suffixed by -pi to indicate a female human and -pa to
indicate a male human. (18b,c) are further examples.(18) a. nupi    'female human'          nupa    'male human'

are based on adjectives used in naming a child. Thus the eldest male child is
named Tomba and the eldest female child is named Tombi from ton 'top' and
one of the gender suffixes.
  Occupational titles of professions traditionally held by men do not have
female equivalents (18d). Where men are the predominant workers in a given
profession, the masculine professional title can refer to male or female workers
in that occupation. Thus (18e-g) may refer to a male or female potter, gold-
smith or story teller, respectively. (18h) is a special case in that, although wea-
vers are predominantly female, the occupational title used is the masculine
form.(18) d. usuba          'carpenter'
     e. czphusaba      'potter'
     f. ssnäsaba       'goldsmith'

     h. phisaba        'weaver'7.2.2.2 Category 3: Number and quantificationAlthough nouns are not obligatorily marked for number they may occur with
such specification. Singular nouns can be indicated by the numeral srrid 'one'
as in (19a).(19) a. fjdratj    mi ami       lak?i

"Plurality is indicated with the numerals higher than one or by -sirj (layriksiij
'books', Θηάηςΐη 'children'). First, second and third person plural pronouns are
signalled with khoy 'this and other like this' (see section 3.3.1.1), which is also
used with human nouns to signify the inclusion of those physically surrounding
or closely associated to the suffixed noun, -ήη cannot be used with pronouns
or proper nouns and khoy cannot be used with nonhuman nouns.81

noun Tomba is suffixed by khoy to indicate 'Tomba and his family'; with the
additional suffixation of -lom the construction can be translated as 'Tomba and

"34.   However, the functional equivalent of a passive construction can be de-
      rived through the omission of an actor or agent argument from a clause.

      Dowty (1979) who develops a classification of verbs to account for basic

4.3 Information structureTable 2 summarizes the arguments that classes of verbs subcategorize for and
the default morphological marking that appears with these arguments. When
pragmatic information is signalled, morphologically-encoded grammatical infor-
mation is often obscured: a system of pragmatic marking may delete an existing
semantic role marker, delete and replace the semantic role marker with one of
the enclitics listed in (18), add one of the enclitics listed in (18) to-a semantic
role marker, and/or change canonical word order. In this section I will identify
the pragmatic values and the formal devices used to indicate those values on
an argument.(18)        -td          exclusive

            -su          inclusive
4.3.1 ContrastivenessA noun phrase may receive one of three types of contrastive focus depending
on whether the enclitic -na 'contrastive', -ti 'delimitative' or -td 'exclusive' is
used.40 Examples (19a-c) contrast an unmarked actor argument with actors
marked by one of these three markers. Although the unmarked ay does not

with possible action of others; syna indicates that out of a group of people no

to do V).(19)   a . dy     cstkdni

appears within the relative clause and a determiner referring to the relativized
noun functions as the nominalizer of the clause. Example (5a) illustrates the
externally headed relative clause construction and (5b-d) illustrate the corre-
sponding internally headed construction.(5)   a. hswna        qdqbd             nupa                  ddo

162      Chapter 6. SubordinationComplements (as discussed in section 6.2), which are structurally similar con-
structions to internally headed relative clauses, have the modified noun occur-
ring to the right of the subordinate clause as in (5e).(5)   e . saqgom         thakpasi                    3ηάηάάϋ

8.1.1 Productive combinationsNominal compounds such as the noun+noun and verb-I-noun compounds given
in (2a-g) are right-headed. In these cases the first root modifies the second
root. In (2e-g), the final root is modified by a noun+verb compound.(2)   a. khotjtem       foot-way                'footpath'
      b. phiruk         cloth-basket            'clothes basket'
      c. yengon         hen-place               'chicken coop'
      d. thakpham       drink-place             'drinking place'
      e. maykhumphi     face-cover-cloth        'veil'
      f. phiyonphäm     cloth-sell-place        'cloth shop'
      g- unbdntha       ice-rule-month          'winter'
262          Chapter 8. Compounding and duplicationNominal compounds of the form noun+verb may be left-headed as in (2h-j)
where the head is modified by a state verb.(2)     h.    phigd          cloth-under              'under garment'
        i.    όϊη}aw         hill-big                 'mountain'
        j.    yumgom         house-collect            'outhouse, urinal'Examples of exocentric nominal compounds, where neither root is the head, as
in English deaf-mute, are given in (2k-m).(2)     k.    mitna          eye-nose                 'organs'
        1.    ίύ/ώοη         stream-ditch             'marshy land'
        m.    cdkisiij           rice-water           'meal'Exocentric noun+verb compounds are deverbal synthetic compounds (Hoe-
ksema 1985: 142) where the first root is the patient of the second. In Meithei
such compounds are most often occupational titles as shown in (2n,o) (where
the gender marker has scope over the entire compound), or a definition of
what an entity is because of some action performed or accomplished by that
entity (2p,q).(2)     n.    phisabi        cloth-weave-FEM          'female cloth weaver'
        o.    cdphusaba      pot-make-MAS             'male potter'
        p.    ύηρη           wood-enter               'axe'
        q.    phijet         dress-wear               'dress'(2r) is a rare example of exocentric verbal compounds in Meithei.(2)     r.    cdthak-        eat-drink                'dine'There are no left-headed verb+verb compounds in the synchronic grammar of
Meithei since these have been reinterpreted as verb+derivational morphemes
(see section 7.1).91
8.1.2   Nonproductive        combinations
In some instances the meaning of the compound can only be obtained through
a figurative interpretation of the relationship between the roots. Thus in (3a)
the mother of the land is 'queen', in (3b) a death on the road is an 'accidental
death', and in (3c) the voice of noisy news is 'rumor'.
                                                          8.1 Compounding      263(3)   a.   foymä        land-mother               'queen, goddess'
      b.    timsi       path-die                  'accidental death'
      c. pawninkhon     news-noisy-voice          'rumor'Some compounds have a specialized meaning. For example, the stative verb
lei- 'best', for example, can be compounded to a noun to indicate the best or
most representative noun of its kind as in (3d,e). In (3f,g), however, the mean-
ing of the compound is narrowed to a specific example: layrel means python
and phtrel is the starter cloth in a weaving loom. Similarly in (3h), 'cloth-fold'
does not refer to any folded cloth but to a garment used in a specific ritual.(3)   d. turel          stream-best               'river'
      e. hirel          boat-best                 'best boat'
      f. layrel         snake-best                'python'
      g· phirel         cloth-best                'topmost cloth'
      h. phidup         cloth-fold                'cloth for Shrada ceremony'The examples in (3i-m) illustrate more idiomatic compounds where the
meaning is not recoverable from the meaning of the roots.      i.   gurummtra    mentor-chant              'absolutely correct'
      j.   niqthaw      wish-soul                 'king'
      k.   matikcäba    NM-fit-eat                'be fit'
      1.   khudoqcäbd   hand-bridge-eat           'opportunity'      m. khoqgoynzre
         khoq -khoy -na         -te     -e
         foot -rough -INST -PERF -ASRT
         'insulted' (Literally: by roughing up the leg)
8.1.3 Affixation within compoundsIt is also possible for derived or inflected forms to be members of compounds.
A noun root is compounded to verb stem in (4a) and to an inflected noun in
(4b).(4)   a. caynarol
         cgy -na                -Ion
         beat -RECIP            -language
         'rules for fighting'

               wrap -INST -cloth
               'wrapper, shawl'In (4c,d), the attributive prefix has scope over the first root and not the whole
compound. In this sense, prefixation is affixation within the compound.(4)     c.     9thenpot
               a      -then          -pot
               ATT -display          -thing

               ATT -sew -price
               'sewing charge'
8.2 DuplicationSection 8.2 describes the creation of lexical collocations by partially or fully
duplicating a constituent or part of a constituent or by pairing a constituent or
part of a constituent with a rhyming word. Often referred to as echo-word
formation or reduplication (Abbi 1992), this word formation process is com-
mon in Tibeto-Burman languages and across language families in Southeast
Asia.92 Ch. Nandakumari Devi (1985), Ch. Yashawanta Singh (1988), Th.
Harimohon Singh (1989b) and N. Khelchandra Singh (1964) discuss the various
methods of duplication which exist in Meithei, and I will present a formal and
functional analysis of these in this section.","[287, 288, 289, 290]"
"However, -lom cannot be used with nonhuman nouns: *phirom where phi
means 'cloth' and *huyrom where huy means 'dog'.
  -hk 'multiplicative' can be suffixed to numerals to the indicate the number of
times that some action is performed. The resulting form is a noun since a
numeral suffixed by -hk may be further suffixed by case markers.( 1 9 ) e . tidhäk        hazard»              marirdktagi

                                Introduction
1.1 ClassificationThis book is a grammatical description of Meithei, a Tibeto-Burman language.
There are about 250 Tibeto-Burman languages, with approximately 56 million
speakers living in China, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, Myanmar (formerly
Burma), Laos, Thailand and Vietnam (Matisoff 1991b: 478—179). In his
Introduction to Sino-Tibetan, Shafer (1966/1967) presented an internal sub-
grouping of Tibeto-Burman languages. However, Matisoff (1991b: 473) has
pointed out that the amount and quality of data available to Shafer did not
justify his groupings. In the influential work Sino-Tibetan: A Conspectus
(Benedict 1972), which relates Chinese to Tibeto-Burman, the exact relation-
ship of Tibeto-Burman languages to each other is said to be too complex to
define with traditional methods and is left open. To date, Sino-Tibetan his-
torical linguists operate with a ""working hypothesis"" of language relationships
within Tibeto-Burman. MatisofFs (1991b) heuristic model consists of seven
groups:Group           Approximate locationKamarupan       Northeast India, Western Myanmar
Himalayish      Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim
Qiangic         Sichuan
Kachinic        Sichuan, Yunnan, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam
Lolo-Burmese    Northern Myanmar, Thailand, Yunnan
Baic            Yunnan
Karenic         Burma and ThailandMeithei falls in the geographically determined group Kamarupan (from the
Sanskrit word Kämarüpa for Assam). Traditionally, the subgroups postulated
for this area are Kuki-Chin-Naga, Abor-Miri-Dafla and Bodo-Garo. Earlier
classifications put Meithei in a Kuki-Chin (Grierson 1903—1928) or Kuki-Chin-
Naga sub-group (Voegelin and Voegelin 1965: 17). However, it has generally
been recognized that the Mikir, Mru and Meithei languages do not fit readily
into this or other sub-groups of the area. Although DeLancey (1987: 800)
postulates a distinct Mikir-Meithei sub-branch, I remain agnostic, pending the
collection of more data on other languages in the group, on the exact position
of Meithei within Kamarupan.
2       Chapter 1. Introduction   On the one hand, Meithei shares many features with Tibeto-Burman lan-
guages such as tone, widespread stem homophony, agglutinative verb morpho-
logy, verb derivational suffixes originating from the semantic bleaching of verbs,
duplication or elaboration (see Chapter 8), evidentiality and emotional atti-
tudes signalled through sentence final particles, aspect rather than tense mark-
ing, lack of gender marking, verb final word order and the lack of grammatical
relations such as ""subject"" and ""object"" (DeLancey 1987, Matisoff 1991b). On
the other hand, Meithei is atypical for the Kamarupan group in some signif-
icant ways. It lacks pronominal marking on the verb, which is considered an
original Tibeto-Burman trait (Bauman 1975, DeLancey 1989b),1 and it lacks
numeral classifiers. Also, due to extensive cultural contact with Indo-Aryan
languages, in particular Bengali and Sanskrit, and in recent times Assamese
and Hindi, Meithei contains a large number of borrowed lexical items and
some non-Tibeto-Burman constructions such as the use of question words as
heads of relative clauses.
   Meithei is known by different names. The loconym Manipuri, a term derived
on analogy with other place names in India such as Kanpur where -pur is of
Sanskrit origin meaning 'state, place', is used by the Indian government and
non-Meithei Indian scholars. Folk etymologies for Manipur originate from my-
thology: a snake god Vasuki is said to have thrown out a shining diamond (or
mani, the Sanskrit word for jewel) from its head which filled the land with
natural beauty or jewels. Government-run institutions in Manipur use this
name; for example, Manipur Language Department and All India Radio News in
Manipuri. On ideological grounds many Meithei speakers prefer to use the
glossonym Meitheiron which contains Ion 'language' (N. Promodini Devi 1989a).
In the linguistic literature written by western scholars, the term Meithei (some-
times spelled Meitei) is used. Meithei scholars seem to make a distinction
between whether they are writing in Meithei (when they tend to use the term
Meitheiron) or in English (when they use Meithei). The term Meithei itself
may be a compound of mi 'man' and they· 'separate' (Hodson 1908: 10).
Sohini Ray (p.c.) has pointed out that a current term in use by Meithei
""revivalists"", those who wish to assert Meithei religious, cultural and political
autonomy from India, is Meetei. The origin of this term and its pronunciation
are yet unclear to me.
  I have adopted the practice of using the term Meithei to refer to the lan-
guage of the Meithei since this is what speakers prefer. Also, this avoids con-
fusing the Tibeto-Burman language spoken in Manipur with Bishnupriya Mani-
puri which is an Indo-Aryan language that was spoken in Manipur between the
13th and 19th century. In the early 1800s Bishnupriya speakers migrated from
Manipur to neighboring Assam, Tripura and Sylhet. Due to the long period of
contact with it, Bishnupriya Manipuri has borrowed many words and some
suffixes from Meithei (Sinha 1974, 1986).
                                                           1.2 Geography       31.2 GeographyMeithei is spoken predominantly in Manipur State. Smaller populations of
speakers fled Manipur, due to either internal wars or wars with Myanmar, to
neighboring Assam (Sylhet, Sibsagar and Silchar), Bangladesh (Dacca and
Mymensingh) and the hills of Tripura. Meitheis can also be found in Myanmar
where they were taken as captives in 1819 during invasions by the Meitheis of
Myanmar. Manipur is bordered by Myanmar to the East, Mizoram to the
South, Nagaland to the North, and Assam to the West and Northwest.
   The state consists of 22,356 square kilometers, 1813 kilometers of which are
level country approximately 750 meters above sea level. This level area is
populated mainly by the Meithei and 120,000 Muslims who are the progeny of
the intermarriage of Muslim traders and laborers with Meithei women. It is
possible that the original population of Muslims were prisoners of war taken by
the Meitheis from Cachar (Hodson 1908).
   The 20,543 square kilometers of hill territory are populated by about 500,000
people belonging to Naga (Angami, Kabui (called Rongmei in Manipur),
Kacha, Lamgang, Mao, Maram, Maring, Tangkhul) and Kuki-Chin (Mizo
(Lushai), Hmar, Koireng, Kom, Ralte, Simte, Thadou, Zou) tribes. Other
tribes which live in the state are listed as Old Kuki tribes because their lan-
guages have resemblances to both Naga and Kuki-Chin groups (Aimol, Anai,
Chote, Koirao, Tarao, Monsang, Moyon, Paite, Vaiphei). The Chiru and
Gangte tribes also live in Manipur.2
   According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, Book of the Year 1993 (1994:
780), there are 1,180,000 native speakers of Meithei, although the number of
actual speakers is higher since Meithei is used as a lingua franca in the state
and is spoken by about 60% of the state population (Sen 1992: 23). As of
1981, when the last national census was taken, 41% of the total population in
Manipur was literate. English and Meithei are the state languages. Meithei
speakers are for the most part monolingual, but many can understand Hindi
and English through constant exposure to the Hindi and English news and
entertainment media. Educated speakers (those who have the equivalent of a
high school education) have at least a marginal competency in English.
   Manipur is divided into 8 districts: Imphal, Bishnupur, Thoubal, Ukhrul,
Senapati, Tamenglong, Churachandpur and Chandel. The state capital is Im-
phal city, in the district of the same name.
   The hill ranges run mostly north to south and are connected by spurs and
ridges that run from west to east. The Naga hills are to the north, the Mani-
pur hills begin at the eastern border with Myanmar, the Lushai and Chin hills
are to the south. The highest hills are in the northeast with the highest point,
Kacho Phung, reaching about 3000 meters (9,843 feet).
4       Chapter 1. Introduction   The most important river in the state is the Imphal, which flows from the
 north through the plains for about 130 kilometers to eventually join the
 Chindwin river of Myanmar, a tributary of the Irrawady river. The other sig-
 nificant rivers are the Iril (96 kilometers long) and the Thoubal (88 kilometers
 long). Both meet the Imphal river south of Imphal city.
   Manipur is known for its many natural lakes, especially Loktak lake, the
biggest fresh water lake in eastern India which in the rainy season covers about
 100 square kilometers and in the dry season about 64 square kilometers. The
monsoon is from May to September and the average rainfall in the state is
2077.7 millimeters.
   The Manipuri hills are covered with evergreen forests which are being gra-
dually reduced in size due to slash-and-burn agriculture: there were 15,090
square kilometers of forest area in 1975, which had been reduced to about
 13,572 square kilometers by 1982 (Sen 1992: 8).
   Manipur flora include bamboo, cane, cotton, lotus (including a famed variety
with 108 petals), rhododendron bushes, and water lilies. More than 100 variet-
ies of orchids are grown and exhibited at an orchid park in Khongampat on the
outskirts of Imphal. Fauna includes leopard, bear, wolf and various species of
deer (including the rare brow-antlered Thamin deer), snakes and (edible)
frogs. The elephant was common before the time of the British.
   The main crop of the state is rice and rice cultivation is a traditional occupa-
tion for Meitheis. Although some farmers are adopting modern cultivation
methods, most still use buffaloes yoked to wooden ploughs to till soil. The
biggest industry in the state is handloom textiles. Lower-caste families living in
the plains practice mulberry rearing to produce raw silk that is used by the
handloom industry. Fishing comprises 2% of the state's income. A wide array
of indigenous fishing gear, such as weirs, bamboo and cane baskets, spears and
nets can be seen in use around the Loktak area and even within Imphal city
limits. Other industries are cultivation of sugarcane, pear, apple, pineapple,
banana, guava, peach, cabbage, pumpkin, chilies, potato, and sweet potato.
Tobacco and betel leaves are grown in abundance. Teak and rubber trees are
found in the hills.
   There is an airport in Imphal with flights to Calcutta, Assam and New Delhi.
There is no railway in Manipur; only two main roads, Highways 39 and 53,
connect the state to the rest of India. Transportation on these roads is not
always feasible due to landslides, and transport of goods in and out of Manipur
is often delayed. Imphal is connected to the other state districts by smaller
highways which can safely be travelled by jeep but not by car. Non-citizens
may enter the state only by permission of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs
in New Delhi. Indian citizens who visit Manipur through Nagaland must also
seek a permit.

1979-1980, the average per capita income in India was 1379 rupees, while for
the same time period it was 822 rupees in Manipur (Ahluwalia and Ahluwalia
1984: 87). In 1982, out of 1,949 villages only 322 were electrified. Drinking
water is scarce in most rural areas and in some urban areas as well.","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"
