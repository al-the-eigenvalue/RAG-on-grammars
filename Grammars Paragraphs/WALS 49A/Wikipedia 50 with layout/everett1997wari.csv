The first major study of any Chapakuran language makes an important contribution to the
database of linguistic theory, and is one of the most detailed descriptions ever published
of any Amazonian language. This study is especially timely as the Chapakuran languages
of Western Brazil and Eastern Bolivia are endangered, and less than 2,000 known
speakers of Wari' and its related dialects are left in existence.
   The authors offer a unique, comprehensive grammatical description of Wari', covering
areas such as syntax, negation, morphology, phonology, ideophone/interjection and
lexicon.
   This descriptive grammar will appeal to linguistic scholars and students alike.
   Daniel L.Everett is a specialist on a variety of Amazonian languages and is currently
Professor and Chair of the Department of Linguistics, University of Pittsburgh. Barbara
Kern, a native of California and missionary linguist belonging to New Tribes Mission,
has lived among the Wari' people for nearly 34 years and speaks their language fluently.

                              Editorial statementUntil quite recently, work on theoretical linguistics and work on language description
proceeded almost entirely in isolation from one another. Work on theoretical linguistics,
especially in syntax, concentrated primarily on English, and its results were felt to be
inapplicable to those interested in describing other languages. Work on describing
individual languages was almost deliberately isolationist, with the development of a
different framework and terminology for each language or language group, and no
feeding of the achievements of language description into linguistic theory. Within the last
few years, however, a major rapprochement has taken place between theoretical and
descriptive linguistics. In particular, the rise of language typology and the study of
language universals have produced a large number of theoreticians who require accurate,
well-formulated descriptive data from a wide range of languages, and have shown
descriptive linguists that they can both derive benefit from and contribute to the
development of linguistic theory. Even within generative syntax, long the bastion of
linguistic anglocentrism, there is an increased interest in the relation between syntactic
theory and a wide range of language types.
   For a really fruitful interaction between theoretical and descriptive linguistics, it is
essential that descriptions of different languages should be comparable. The
Questionnaire of the present series (originally published as Lingua, vol. 42 (1977), no. 1)
provides a framework for the description of a language that is (a) sufficiently
comprehensive to cover the major structures of any language that are likely to be of
theoretical interest; (b) sufficiently explicit to make cross-language comparisons a
feasible undertaking (in particular, through the detailed numbering key); and (c)
sufficiently flexible to encompass the range of variety that is found in human language.
The volumes that were published in the predecessor to the present series, the Lingua
Descriptive Studies (now available from Routledge), succeeded in bridging the gap
between theory and description: authors include both theoreticians who are also
interested in description and field-workers with an interest in theory.
   The aim of the Descriptive Grammars is thus to provide descriptions of a wide range
of languages according to the format set out in the Questionnaire. Each language will be
covered in a single volume. The first priority of the series is grammars of languages for
which detailed descriptions are not at present available. However, the series will also
encompass descriptions of better-known languages with the series framework providing
more detailed descriptions of such languages than are currently available (as with the
monographs on West Greenlandic and Kannada).

                                        PrefaceWari' ‘We!’ (1pincl emphatic pronoun) is the autodenomination of a tribe composed of
several subgroups, totalling approximately 1,800 people, who live along various
tributaries of the Pacaas Novos river and other affluents of the Mamore river in Western
Rondonia, Brazil, along the Bolivian border.1 The people is known most simply by the
name of the river, Pacaas Novos, although we shall not use that term here. The dialect
described in this grammar is of the 'Oro Nao' clan. We will use Wari' when referring to
the entire language or all the subgroups and will use 'Oro Nao' ('ON, lit. ‘the Bats’) when
referring to the specific dialect described in this grammar. Other subgroups of the Wari'
include 'Oro 'Eo ‘the Burpers’, 'Oro ‘At ‘the Bones’ 'Oro Jowin ‘the Jowin monkeys’,
'Oro Waram ‘the Waram Monkeys’, 'Oro Waram Xijein ‘the other waram monkeys’,
'Oro Mon ‘the Faeces’, and 'Oro Cao' Orowaji ‘the Eaters of Green Things’. Wari' is a
member of the Chapakuran (Txapacura) family, which also includes the 'Oro Win
(approximately forty speakers; not a dialect of Wari', in spite of its name), located at the
headwaters of the Pacaas Novos river, and the More, who live in eastern Bolivia. It is not
known how many More speakers there are. There do not appear to be any other languages
of this family still living. This grammar is the first detailed analysis of any Chapakuran
language.
    We realize that our study is incomplete in many respects and we expect to conduct
further research to be reported on in future studies. Nevertheless, our goal here is to
provide a solid introduction to the major features of 'ON grammar, pointing out where
relevant points of particular typological or theoretical interest, although for the most part
we have followed the series outline closely and have avoided theoretical discussions.
    A word about our joint authorship is in order. We would like to emphasize that this
grammar is um trabalho de quatro mãos, i.e. truly a jointly authored study. Our names
are listed alphabetically. Each of us has spent time considering every statement and
example on every page of this study. In so far as is possible, we agree on the entire
content. However, if there are errors remaining, each of us blames the other for not
catching them.
    On the other hand, DE would like to stress the fact that this grammar was only
possible due to BK’s 32 years of fieldwork and data-collection (copious field notes and
over 700 pages of text), as well as her fluency in the language. DE himself has only had a
few days of actual informant work on the language. In this sense BK is the primary
author.
    We would like to thank numerous people and organizations for their help in preparing
this grammar. We thank the editorial board of the Routledge Grammar Series for inviting
us to contribute this study. Without that impetus, we might have given up at points due to
the miles separating us. We would also like to thank the New Tribes Mission and the
Summer Institute of Linguistics for logistic and financial support at various phases of this
study. DE would like to thank the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Latin American
Studies, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Department of Linguistics for
their financial and moral support of his Amazonian research over the last several years
(as well as the National Science Foundation for a grant to study Arawan languages, from
which he borrowed a few weeks to complete this grammar before heading out to the
Banawa' village). We would also like to acknowledge here the pioneering work of all the
New Tribes missionaries who as a group have worked with the Wari' since the initial
contact in 1957, in particular Royal Taylor, whose collaboration in the study of Wari'
contributed much to the analysis of the language, and BK’s husband, Manfred, without
whose patience and steadfast support this work would never have become a reality. DE
would like to thank also Keren Everett for her support to him during the many weeks of
preparing the final version of the manuscript, when he was very poor company and
interested in talking about little but Wari'. We would also like to salute the work of
various chefes de posto of Brazil’s National Indian Foundation (the FUNAI) for their
dedication to the Wari' and other indigenous groups of Brazil. These people are often the
unsung heroes of efforts to help the Indians.
    Finally, but especially, we want to thank the Wari' themselves for their patient
teaching of their language, their warm acceptance and their hospitality. It is our hope that
at least part of the richness of this people’s language will emerge in the following pages.
We express our deepest hopes and prayers for their continued health and vitality as a
people.

  This autodenomination differs interestingly from subgroup names, such as 'Oro Nao', the name of
the subgroup whose dialect we are describing here, in that it lacks the collective word 'oro.
However, the Pacaas Novos people rejected our attempts to use the phrase 'Oro Wari' ‘all the
people’ as the autodenomination of the entire group, insisting that the correct term was simply
Wari'.

              An overview of 'Oro Nao' Grammar                                 0.0. INTRODUCTIONThe purpose of this introduction is to highlight certain features of 'Oro Nao' grammar that
we believe other linguists should find particularly interesting, just in case they are trying
to decide whether or not to read this grammar. It is not meant to serve as a stand-alone
introduction to Wari' or 'Oro Nao' but merely to draw attention to features of the grammar
covered in detail below.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"                                        0.2.2. Nouns
Nouns occur in argument and adjunct positions in the clause and trigger agreement on a
preceding preposition or verbal inflectional clitic (VIC). They may also trigger agreement
on a nominal inflectional clitic (NIC), following the possessor noun. Nouns trigger
agreement for person, number and gender. Since only nouns referring to humans may
trigger number agreement, number can be understood as a dependant of the feature
[+human]. Genders are feminine (for human females only), masculine (for human males
or certain animals, fish and bird species) and neuter (for most plants and inanimate
objects). This gives us the values and groups in Table 0.1, according to the grammatical
features [human] and [female]:
                    Table 0.1 Grammatical feature combinations
FEMININE                                    NONFEMININE
[+HUMAN, +FEMALE]                           [−FEMALE]=MASCULINE
                                            [−HUMAN]=NEUTER
This is an interesting gender distribution, since it does not involve simple conjunctions of
values for the feature pair [human] and [female]. Only human females are marked by
both features, producing the first division. In the second major division, nonfemale, the
features are opposed equipollently rather than privatively. Some nouns in the lexicon will
be marked [+ human, + female], others [−human], and still others merely [−female].1 In
mixed groups, masculine gender is always overridden:
(a)        masculine+feminine=feminine
(b)        masculine+neuter=neuterAs is seen in the main body of the grammar, neuter and feminine are never mixed, nor are
all three genders ever conjoined in a single NP.

    Thus, Chapacuran is one of the rare language families in the Amazon which manifests
grammatical gender distinctions, the other families being Arawan and Arawakan.
However, contra Greenberg (1987), these families are not related, at least they share no
obvious cognates and the presence of gender is hardly a sufficiently reliable criterion
alone to posit any genetic affiliation (see Everett 1996).
    Like many languages with rich agreement, in 'ON nouns usually only appear in
sentences to signal particular discourse functions and in isolated sentences to avoid
ambiguity. Otherwise, it is more common merely to reference participants in a
predication via VICS, NICS, or the inflected preposition wherever possible.
    (Nonpronominal) nouns are not themselves marked for case, number, person or
gender. These features are discernible via agreement and certain verbal modificational
forms. There are two broad classes of nouns, -xi' nouns (so-called because their citation
form ends in -xi' 1pincl) and non-xi' nouns. Kinship terms form a third (closed), minor
class. Both -xi' nouns and kinship terms are inalienably possessed. The non-xi' nouns for
the most part all have -xi' forms as well. The non-xi' forms are themselves subdivided
into nonpossessable and possessable nouns. Non-xi' forms which may not be possessed
(although if they have a -xi' form they may be possessed in that form) are body parts,
exclusively. Optionally possessable non-xi' forms can be marked as possessed via NICS.
The distinction between -xi' vs non-xi' nouns is also important for the derivational
morphology since non-xi' nouns when zero-derived to form verbs usually form
attributive, nonactive verbs, whereas verbs zero-derived from -xi' nouns are almost
always active.
    Although case is not overtly marked on nouns, the verbal inflectional clitic is sensitive
to the semantic role that the noun phrase bears in the clause, rigidly observing the
following hierarchy for object agreement (subject agreement is always obligatory,
regardless of the semantic role of the subject):
(c) GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>
    LOCATION>TIMEThat is, if there is a GOAL in the clause, the object portion of the VIC must agree with it
(if there is also a theme, it is usually expressed as the object of the preposition, much as
Relational Grammar’s ‘3→2 Advancement’ would predict); if there is a circumstance
(but no goal) then it will be referenced on the VIC, and so on down the hierarchy, with

                        2.2. DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY                                    2.2.1. Introduction
In this section, we deviate somewhat from the suggested outline in order to present more
effectively some of the highly unusual, perhaps unique, features of 'ON derivational
morphology. There are various derivational processes in the language, but two are worth
special mention here, since they are used to derive both nouns and verbs. These are zero-
derivation and compounding. Other derivational processes, e.g. iteration and suffixation,
are discussed in the final subsections of this section. The process of zero-derivation is of
particular interest to all theoretical and typological morphologists, because by this
process words may be derived from sentences. This requires us to allow the derivational
morphological component of 'ON grammar to apply to both the input and output of
sentence formation, something which some syntactic and morphological theories predict
to be impossible. Compounding provides additional evidence for this claim. We are going
to argue too that all words in 'ON are left-headed, whether derived by inflectional or
derivational processes.
    We have organized this section around derivational processes, rather than by the
categories which undergo these processes (e.g. N and V), since for the most part, the
processes described may apply to similar input categories to derive nouns or verbs
(although there are interesting differences in the nature of the input category).

                                  2.2.2. Zero-derivation
Zero-derivation is the process whereby words of one syntactic category are derived from
other syntactic categories without affixation (e.g. English He is the head of the
committee; He heads the committee; I will give you a permit; I will permit you). The only
phonological reflex of zero-derivation in ‘ON is the stress shift seen when the category
serving as input to the derivational process is larger than a single word. All words receive
primary stress on their final syllable, modulo certain stress-avoiding postverbal
modifying morphemes, regardless of how many words formed the input to the
derivational process (as in the case of sentences used as verbs). See 2.2.2.1.1 and 3.3.2
below on stress.","[359, 360]"

                           ‘He hit you.’A transitive verb may occur without expressing the direct object (181a), either as an NP
or a VIC. An intransitive verb may occur with an oblique argument that is marked by the
object VIC, making it appear transitive (181b)—see 1.2.1.2.3-4. See also 1.2.1.2.4, where
we discuss demotion of a direct object to oblique object.

preposition.

             ‘Give Hatem the fish.’An indefinite theme or patient need not be preceded by the preposition, however (see
1.2.5.2.4).

                            1.2.1.2.3. Indirect object and ethical dative
1.2.1.2.3.1. Indirect object When more than one object-like argument occurs in the
sentence, the object referenced in the VIC will be the highest on the hierarchy: indirect
object (goal/circumstance)>direct object (theme/patient)>oblique object (although an
indirect and oblique object rarely occur in the same sentence). We will use the labels
indirect object, direct object and oblique object to refer to grammatical relations borne by
goal, theme/patient and oblique arguments in English (or ‘underlying grammatical
relations’). The object VIC is always required with definite objects, but optional with
indefinite objects, as discussed in 1.2.5.2.4. Thus a definite indirect object will always be
marked on the VIC. If there is no indirect object, the direct object can be marked on the
                                                      Wari'     120
VIC. If neither of these two occur, the oblique object may be referenced by the VIC. In
the extremely rare cases where more than one oblique object occurs, we have noticed the
following preference for marking on the VIC: location>time (see 2.1.1.4.3 and 2.1.1.4.4
for a discussion of instrumental and comitative roles; we will simply say here that
instrumental and comitative cannot cooccur). Objects not referenced by the VIC will be
marked by an appropriate form of the preposition (except in the cases discussed in
1.2.5.2.4). All NP arguments are optional when referenced by an agreement morpheme.

The prepositional phrase is defined mainly in terms of its internal composition: the head,
consisting of an inflected form of the single 'ON preposition (see 2.1.5), followed by an
optional nominal element, composed of an NP (238a–c), noun clause (238d), or derived
noun (238e). The first or second person inflection of the preposition appears alone, i.e. no

nominal element may follow it (238f). The prepositional phrase is further defined by its
syntactic function as an object-like argument to the verb—see 1.2.1.2.3–4.

                        0.3. DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGYTypologists and theoreticians should find 'ON derivational morphology quite interesting
since sentences and phrases productively serve as input to zero-derivation and
compounding. These processes in fact provide interesting evidence for sentence
constituent structure. Zero-derivation takes a word, phrase or clause as input and returns a
single word as output, with no affixation. When the input is larger than a single
grammatical word it may be distinguished from the output prosodically since the output
will receive a single primary stress on its rightmost syllable. The stresses on the rightmost
syllable of each individual word of the input will surface as secondary stresses in the
output. Vowel harmony does not apply across words, even when they have been
compounded.
   There is a simple argument which shows that the output Cc zero-derivation of a verb
from a clause is a single word, viz., tense placement. As we remark later on in this
overview and in the main body of the grammar, tense must be the second constituent in
the clause when it occurs. But a tense VIC may follow an entire ‘verbalized’ clause,
strongly supporting our analysis of these structures as single words, i.e. verbs. Another
argument in favour of verbalization of entire clauses is that if they are not verbs they
would be the only examples of nonCOMP or nonverb-initial clauses in the language. This
result is therefore potentially significant for theories of the lexicon and its interface with
the syntax, as well as general typologies of morphological systems.
   Nouns can also be zero-derived from various combinations of morphemes, including
verbs, INFL+verb pieces, verb+VIC, entire clauses and nominalized clauses, providing
additional information on constituent structure.
   Compounding is another very interesting and highly productive derivational process in
'ON. In fact, nearly all multimorphemic verbs are derived via compounding (except for
zero-derived phrases), with reduplication accounting for the rest. That is, verbs are not
formed by simple affixation, nor by incorporation. Nouns occur in verbs only by zero-
derivation, often followed by compounding. This is interesting since regardless of the
morphemic complexity of 'ON verbs, they never undergo affixation (aside from
reduplication). In this sense, 'ON verbal morphology might be considered almost
exclusively derivational, since reduplication itself appears largely, if not completely,
derivational in its meaning, although this cannot be asserted categorically due to the fact
that the output of reduplication semantically is often aspectual. On the other hand,
aspectual morphology is not easily classifiable in terms of the derivational-inflectional
split. If we consider it inflectional, then it is the only case of inflectional verb
morphology. If we consider aspectual change derivational, then 'ON verbs have no
inflectional morphology at all, except for suppletive plural/aspectual forms. The only
                          An overview of 'oro nao' grammar      7
clear cases of inflectional morphology throughout 'ON grammar are then -xi' nouns, the
preposition, NICS, and VICS, and possibly the emphatic pronouns (if we consider each
of the different emphatic pronominal forms to be derived via suppletive inflection from a
single base—a questionable tactic).","[19, 20]"
"                                   0.2.5. Emphatic pronouns
There are emphatic pronouns for all grammatical person, number, and gender
combinations. These can only be used as zero-derived verbs, in left-dislocation position,
and as arguments of the verb, in which case they must be followed immediately by an
appositional noun further specifying their referent (usually a proper noun). First and
                          An overview of 'oro nao' grammar      5
second person emphatic pronouns may only be used as replies to questions or as
exclamations, in left-dislocated position, and in certain kinds of list structures. The first
person plural inclusive emphatic pronoun is wari', the autodenomination of the people.
   Interestingly, there are no simple personal pronouns in the language. Personal pronoun
functions are expressed via demonstratives.","[17, 18]"
"                        0.2.7.2. Verbal inflectional clitics (VICS)
VICS always express person, number and gender (for third person) of the subject and
‘primary’ object (according to the semantic role hierarchy in (c) above). They also
express tense when the verb is clause-initial, except when tense is prohibited by a
particular postverbal modifier. The VIC is a (simple) clitic. As with NICS, VICS fail to
undergo vowel harmony with the word immediately preceding them, in this case the verb,
and they never bear primary stress. Unlike NICS, however, they can appear alone in
certain types of question responses and discourse circumstances (which certainly argues
against affixal status for them). We analyse each of the two parts of the VIC (subject and
object agreements) as affixes, at least prosodically:
(e)     [VIC subject agreement-object agreement]The two parts of the VIC are stressed as a single word (stress on the last syllable) and
vowel harmony may take the entire VIC in its scope, but is otherwise allowed only within
words, VICS almost always form a single pause or breath group with the verb. By
labelling the VIC as a simple clitic (as per Zwicky 1977; see also Everett 1996), we claim
                                          Wari'   6
that the VIC is in fact a grammatical word, but phonologically dependent, in this case
part of the preceding pause or breath group. Although rhythmically it seems to be part of
the preceding verb, intonation always falls sharply immediately before the VIC.
   VICS may also manifest tense, but only when the VIC is in second position in its
clause. This is a result of the fact that tense in 'ON must occur in sentence second
position; see below.","[18, 19]"
"                                       0.2.3. Verbs
The class of verbs is the most productive word class in the language. Most adjectival
notions, as well as traditionally verbal meanings, are expressed as verbs. The majority of
loan words, regardless of the word class in the source language, enter Wari' as verbs.
Verbs may be either transitive, intransitive or ambitransitive, although the last class is
quite small. The last class, as one might expect, subdivides those where the intransitive
subject corresponds to the transitive object from those where the transitive subject
corresponds to the intransitive subject, with the verb for ‘turn over’ representing the first
class and the verb for ‘break’ the second class (e.g. ‘I turned over the baby’ vs ‘The baby
turned over’; ‘The man broke his arm’ vs ‘The man broke’). Perhaps the most remarkable
                                              Wari'    4
fact about verbs in 'ON is the almost complete absence of verbal inflectional processes
alongside a rich set of derivational processes. Nouns, emphatic pronouns and sentences
may all form verbs via zero-derivation. Any verb, whether nonderived or derived
(including ‘desententialized’ verbs, i.e. verbs derived from sentences), may be
compounded to form new verbs or to increase transitivity. Verb compounding never
reduces the transitivity of the verb as a whole, which is set by the leftmost member of the
compound, which we analyse as the head of the compound.
   There are two minor classes of verbs which we have labelled preverbal and postverbal
modifiers. These differ from main verbs in two ways, according to our analysis: (i) they
may never occur in the predicate outside of a compound; and (ii) some of the preverbal
modifiers may also modify nouns, in prehead position within the NP. Verbal compounds
are always constructed according to the following template (superscripts indicate number
of times a category can reoccur in a single sequence. No superscript means that there is
no reoccurrence allowed):
(d)   preverbal modifier effect2 postverbal modifier2 initial action/cause resultEach effect/result is produced by the action of the verb (in its compound) to its immediate
left, suggesting an iconic principle of compound formation.
    Verbs are uninflected by affixation, except for reduplication, which marks aspect.
There are various types of reduplication processes. One interesting aspect of
reduplication is that an inflectional (INFL) morpheme otherwise expected in a particular
clause will sometimes not co-occur with reduplication.
    Aside from compounding, zero-derivation and reduplication, verb morphology in 'ON
is quite simple. Certainly it is one of the simplest morphological systems in Lowland
Amazonia. Nevertheless, this simplicity is deceptive since this language provides perhaps
the strongest evidence yet documented on the ability of the syntax to feed word-
formation, in violation of certain theoretical proposals and frameworks, such as Lexical
Phonology.
    Valency-reducing morphology is represented on the VIC, with special forms for
active, passive, and reflexive. But since VICS are not part of the verb word, these
inflectional processes are actually independent of the verb per se.","[16, 17]"

Regressive assimilation across morpheme boundaries involving consonants (though see

occurs as a free morpheme, while -ri' and -re' are suffixes.

according to the following principles: (1) if one of the two relevant vowels is marked
[+back], the output vowel will be [+back]; (2) if the two vowels differ as to height, the
output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the input sequence; (3) if the
vowels are identical (the only actual case of identical input vowels in the corpus is /i/+/i/),
then a single, identical vowel is outputted. This process is reminiscent of vowel
coalescence in some dialects of Modern Greek.","[421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426]"
"                                           1.16.2. Pronoun
There are two classes of pronouns: (1) demonstrative and (2) emphatic.
    (1) The demonstrative pronoun is a subclass of nouns. It satisfies three of the syntactic
criteria that define the noun: (i) it may appear by itself as the subject or object of the verb;
                                        Wari'   216
(ii) it may appear by itself as the complement of a form of the preposition; and (iii) it may
appear as the second element (possessor) of a possessed NP. It is different from
nonpronominal nouns, however, in that it cannot be suffixed or postposed by an NIC or
possessive marking suffix, nor can it be followed by a demonstrative.
    (2) The emphatic pronoun is not a subclass of nouns. It cannot occur by itself as the
subject or object of the verb, nor can it appear as the complement of a form of the
preposition. It is marked by its potential to occur alone (in the case of first and second
person) or in apposition to a noun or demonstrative pronoun (in the case of third person)
in coordinate constructions (see 1.3.3) or to express emphasis (see 1.11.2.1.3).","[228, 229]"

Benefactive NPS are licensed by the verb mi' ‘to give’, appearing as the last member of a
verb compound. Mi' adds a benefactive or goal argument to the array of arguments
normally assigned by the root to its immediate left. The added argument is expressed as a
surface direct object - see 1.2.1.2.3.

                                                 2.1.1.4.3. Instrumental
There is no instrumental case. Instrument is expressed by the preverbal modifier mam
‘instrument’. The element with which it is related occurs in a prepositional phrase
following the direct object of the verb.
(396)            Mam             wac         'inon                          hwam            pain                 quit.

                 ‘I cut the fish with a knife.’Instrument may be expressed without mam, although this is much less common:

                  ‘I cut the fish with a knife.’Negative instrument must be expressed by negating a positive instrumental statement,
followed by a parallel positive statement. Instrumental, as the preverbal modifier mam
and a prepositional phrase, may occur in both statements.

                                                 2.1.1.4.4. Comitative
Comitative is expressed by the verb jajao ‘together’. The comitative NP is its direct
object.

Comitative is also expressed by a compound verb, in which jajao precedes the verb root.
When this happens, the comitative NP must appear in a prepositional phrase. This may be
due to the fact that the addition of another verb adds a goal argument, though covert in
the examples in our corpus. On the other hand, this is somewhat speculative, because
there are no examples in the corpus of jajao occurring with a goal when compounded
with another verb, whether intransitive or transitive, and the example in (400b) was said
to be ungrammatical by a native speaker. At this point, we do not have a final account of
these facts.

‘It is good that we be together pleasantly.’Comitative is also expressed by the postverbal modifier wi ‘together’ in a compound
verb. While there is no evidence in the corpus that a compound verb with wi can occur
with a direct object marked on the VIC, we do not believe it would be ill-formed to mark
the direct object on the VIC, as in (401b) and (401d).

                ‘Will they continue killing the fish together?’Comitative is also expressed by an inflected form of the preposition in ‘and’-
coordination—see 1.3.3(4), examples (274).
  Negative comitative is expressed by using the verb jajao in a negative construction.

Circumstance is also expressed by the preverbal modifier mam (see instrumental—
2.1.1.4.3), but unlike instrumental, the element with which it is related cannot occur in a
prepositional phrase. It must be referenced on the object portion of the VIC—see
1.2.1.2.3. The examples below would only be grammatical under a bizarre instrumental

Possessive is marked on the possessed element. It is expressed three ways, each of which
applies to a separate class of nouns:
   (1) The class of possession marking suffixes inflects for person, number, and third
person gender on the bound form of all -xi' nouns, which are inalienably possessed. The
paradigm of possession marking suffixes is as follows (each of these suffixes has
allomorphs that are phonologically conditioned—see discussion and examples in 3.4):
first singular                                                                         -0
second singular                                                                        -m
third singular masculine                                                               -con

third plural masculine                                                -cocon
third plural feminine                                                 -cacamMost -xi' nouns also have free forms, some of which make up a class of nonpossessed
nouns (they cannot be possessed—see 2.1.1.4.6.1), and others of which, together with all
other unpossessed nouns, can be possessed by:
   (2) The class of nominal inflectional clitics that also inflect for person, number, and
third person gender. None of these NICS has allomorphs. The paradigm of NICS is
identical in function and phonologically similar to the possessive suffixes described
above. It is as follows:
first singular                                                        ne
second singular                                                       nem
third singular masculine                                              nucun

third neuter                                                          nein

second plural                                               nuhu'
third plural masculine                                      nucucun
third plural feminine                                       nequequem(3) The Tenseless verbal inflectional clitics mark possession on co' kinship terms—see
the discussion and examples in 2.2.2.2.1.5.
   2.1.1.4.6.1. Alienable and inalienable possession Co- kinship terms, derived from
relative clauses (see 2.2.2.2.1.5), are inalienably possessed, as are -xi' nouns, so-called
because their citation form ends with the suffix -xi' ‘first person plural inclusive’. Most -
xi' nouns have free alternate forms which can be divided into two classes: (1)
nonpossessed forms, which cannot be possessed; and (2) unpossessed forms, which are
accepted by some speakers in alienable possession. The nonpossessed class of nouns
consists of words for body parts: 'at ‘bone’, waji' ‘head’, caxim ‘foot’, jat ‘tooth’, 'ut
‘nose’. Possession of words in this class of nouns must be expressed by the inflection of
their -xi' forms, rather than their free forms:

                                  ‘your (pl) heads’There is some question as to whether the class of unpossessed nouns, that have -xi'
alternate forms, is truly possessable. A few of them have been found in the corpus
((409c) is one example), occurring with the possession marking NICS, but some
informants have said that the use of NICS with these unpossessed forms is
ungrammatical, and that their use is the result of outside pressure from persons who do
not speak the language well. Of the pairs of examples below, (a) is preferred to (b).

Nominal modification, expressed in many languages via adjectives, is expressed in ‘ON
by nouns (but see 1.2.5.2.5, for a discussion of demonstratives which could possibly be
considered adjectives). Attributive modification is handled like a possessive phrase: the
first syntactically nominal element occurs with a genitive morpheme (nominal
inflectional clitic or suffix) and is understood as modifying the second noun. These
genitive nominal elements can have the form of derived nouns (641a) or -xi' nouns
(641b). In addition, one derived kinship term can also be glossed as a modifier (641c).

                                       modification
When a modified element is realized as a (surface) verb, the modification is predicative.
When the modifier is realized as a (surface) noun, the modification is attributive. There
are a few -xi' nouns that inflect only for third person (first and second person may not be
used for possession with these particular -xi' nouns); these words use the same form for
predicative and attributive modification.

In all other cases, there is a distinction between predicative and attributive forms of
modification as follows:
   (1) In -xi' nouns, the first person singular form functions as the complement to a
copula (predicative), whereas attributive modification is expressed by the third person
inflection.

There is no formal distinction between an absolute and a contingent state in 'ON.","[345, 346, 347, 348]"
"                                               2.1.1.4.13. Purpose
There is no formal means of expressing purpose such as that found in ‘I went to Guajará
to get clothes’, or ‘I cut wood for my house.’ This concept may be expressed by two
juxtaposed sentences, the second of which conveys purpose in the following ways.
   (1) By means of a verbalized future tense sentence, described in 1.1.1.4.3.2.2.
(425)       Mao        'inain                 Guajará.             Cut          ta'          wom          ina

            pane.
            rem:past
            ‘I went to Guajará. “I will get clothes”, I (said).’(2) By means of the purpose type of verbal modification clause described in 1.1.2.4.2.3,
in which the purpose clause is expressed as a direct speech, reflecting the thoughts that
motivate the situation. Though (425) is not illformed, (426) is preferred.

                                                2.1.1.4.14. Function
Function is expressed like material (see 2.1.1.4.10): it occurs as a denominalized verb
(first person singular possessive form), and the element to which it is related appears as
the object of the verb.
(427)                Quit                ne                         'inain                        pana.

                     ‘I used the stick as a knife.’
                                                2.1.1.4.15. Reference
There is no special nominal inflection marking reference. Reference is expressed as a
nominal, appearing as the direct object of a verb expressing communication (e.g. pijim'
‘tell’, tomi' ‘to speak’, coromicat ‘to think’). Note its function with an indirect object in
(428b), where the indirect object is marked in the object (suffix) VIC, and the (logical)
direct object is expressed by a prepositional phrase.

                                                 2.1.1.4.16. Essive
Essive is expressed by two juxtaposed sentences, the essive element being in the second
sentence:

                                           2.1.1.4.17. Translative
Translative is expressed as direct speech in the form of a first person singular possessed
noun.

            ‘The people made Xijam chief.’ (lit. ‘“My chief”, the people (said) to Xijam.’)When the translative element is possessed, it must be rephrased as a direct speech
embedded in a direct speech. The translative element may only be expressed in a first
person singular possessed form.

                                          2.1.1.4.19. Partitive
2.1.1.4.19.1–4. Partitive and nonpartitive numeral and quantifier Numeral and
quantifier forms are limited in the language. See 2.1.1.4.9, where we list the verbs that
express numeral and quantity in 'ON. Numerals, including dois ‘two’, are borrowed from
Portuguese (duas ‘two (f)’ is rarely used). Um is never used as a substitute for the verb
xica' pe/to ‘to be alone’/‘to be one’.
   There are no formal means of expressing partitive. There are no significant syntactic
distinctions between numeral and quantifier as they relate to partitive, nor is the line
between partitive and nonpartitive clear. Partitive numeral and quantifier employ
numerals or numeral/quantifier verbs as postverbal modifiers to form a compound with
the verb ma' ‘to exist’. The verb describing the action of the element to which partitive is
related appears in a relative clause whose head is the subject of the verb ma'. This
construction may also be construed to express nonpartitive.
(433) a.    Ma'                       xica'      pe            na              pije'        co                    caxi

           ‘Many of the children are sick.’ (lit. ‘There are many children who are sick.’)While partitive may be taken to mean nonpartitive, nonpartitive may be expressed more
specifically, as in (434), where the number or numeral/ quantifier verb appears in the
postverbal modification position with the verb describing the action of the element to
which nonpartitive is related. There is no relative clause in nonpartitive constructions.

language and culture until recent years (see also 2.1.1.4.9). The nouns tajixi' ‘our leaf or
simply tan ‘leaf’ are used by many to express the concept of money, price or value.

              ‘He has a lot of money!’ (lit. ‘Leaves are much to him!’)Portuguese monetary terms have been incorporated into the language in a limited way:
real and centavo (Brazilian monetary units) usually appear in a compound verb with a
preposed number; dinheiro, the Portuguese term for ‘money’ but generally used as ‘price’
in 'ON, usually appears as a noun, invariably accompanied by a postposed possessive
marking NIC, as in the following exchange:
(437) a.   Cain'         cain'        ne           dinheiro          nein              comi                     naran?

              ‘What is the price of kerosene?’ (lit. ‘How much is light’s water’s money?’)

                         ‘Its price (money) is two reais.’Though both (437) and (438) are acceptable forms, the tendency is to avoid the borrowed
terms as much as possible. (438) is usually preferred to (437).

                                     ‘Its price (leaves) is two.’The relationship shown by English bought it for is usually expressed in a sequence of two
sentences.
(439) Ji'ao 'ina                            comi                 naran.           Dois na                        taji.

                                           2.1.1.4.22–23. Distance and extent
Specific terms for distance and extent are lacking in the language. Portuguese terms have
been borrowed in a limited way; they usually appear as verbs. Relationships are
expressed in a sequence of two sentences, similar to that of price and value in (439). The
first sentence contains a proposition, the quantity implied in distance or extent being
expressed by an 'ON equivalent in the VP. The borrowed term is expressed with a
preposed number in the VP of the second sentence, and its subject usually reiterates the
verb of the first sentence, or a meaning similar to it, in a noun clause or derived noun.

                                                  2.1.1.4.24. Concessive
There is no special form for marking nominals for the concessive case. Concessive is
expressed by the contraexpective type of verbal modification clause. It is usually
preceded by a clause with paxi' ‘not:find’, which is described in 1.1.2.4.2.8.
(441)      Pan'        paxi'               na             xowi'.         'Ane           maqui'            ta'    ne.

                                                   2.1.1.4.25. Inclusion
When an element is to be specifically mentioned as included in a group, it is expressed in
a second sentence as a topicalized element, either as the subject or the left dislocated
topic—see 1.12. The referent particle quem is postposed to the topicalized element.

Like inclusion, exclusion is expressed by a sequence of two sentences. The first expresses
the proposition; the second specifies the element to be excluded from the group. A
relative clause is often used in the second sentence.
(443) a.    Cao' cao' xam'                 nana          'oro           wari'.       Xica'                pe         na

                                                     2.1.1.4.27. Addition
Addition is expressed by a sequence of two sentences, the first of which states the
original proposition, while the second states who is to be ‘added’ to the action of the first.
The referent particle quem is also postposed to the element to be ‘added’ to the action of
the first sentence. The verb mo ‘list presentation’ and the VP ca' na ‘thus it is/was’ are
often used to specify the participants of the addition element (see coordination 1.3).

Vocative nominals usually occur at the end of the sentence. There is no vocative particle.

Citation and label forms are expressed in the following forms:
   (i) Possessed nouns are expressed in their basic form, which is first person plural
inclusive, i.e. winaxi' ‘our heads’ for ‘heads’ in general.
   (ii) Verbs and unpossessed nouns may also be expressed as nominals with the
infinitival/participial marker wa. When the verb is reduplicated, as in (446a–b), the
postverbal modifier qui' ‘coming:this:way’ always accompanies it.

Location in space is expressed (1) by verbs (compound or simple); and/or (2) by body-
part nouns. While the type of location (general, interior, ulterior, etc.) may be expressed
by the body-part noun functioning as the object of the verb, movement in relation to the
location (‘at rest’, ‘motion to’, ‘motion from’, or ‘motion past’) is expressed only by the
verb. The noun to which the local function is related appears as an object of the verb, or
as the possessor of an object of the verb. We will describe in this section the means for
expressing local semantic functions, although none of these involves special case
marking on the noun.","[250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259]"

Appositional constructions are quite common, especially when referring to people by
their names, in which case the kinship, or descriptive, term precedes the name.

                  1.2.5.2.11. Verbal modifiers used as nominal modifiers
Two words appear with nouns to express an adjectival meaning, which may also be used
as preverbal modifiers: 'iri' ‘truly’ and wara ‘already’ render the meanings of ‘real or
good’ and ‘old’ respectively; the verb jimao ‘different’ appears with only two nouns: it
renders a generic meaning to wari' ‘person’ and carawa ‘animal or thing’; and the verb
'om ‘to not exist’ occurs with a few nouns, but this is rare.

           1.2.5.3. Number of modifiers of a particular type which may co-occur
Two or more possessor modifiers (xi' nouns) may occur in an NP, though it is unlikely
that more than two would occur. The second possessor can possess either the head or the
first possessor.

single noun phrase.

                                  heads and various modifiers
There are no constraints on combinations of modifiers. The tendency, however, is to not
overload a sentence, so it is rare that one would find more than three types of modifiers in
a single sentence. Thus, (263b) would be preferred to (263a).

possessor, relative clause, demonstrative. Either of the two nouns in apposition, cwajiri'
or 'Orowao', could be considered the possessor.

There are no simple equivalents of ‘and’-, ‘but’- and ‘or’-coordination, but there are ways
to express this notion in the language. The constructions described here do not
exclusively express a coordination relationship however. They have other functions and
their form is simply 'exploited' to express coordination as well. Most of the examples in
this section are taken from text.                                                 1.3.1.1. ‘and’-coordination
There are two ways to accomplish the effect of ‘and’-coordination between clauses:
   (1) Juxtaposition: When two or more clauses are juxtaposed within a single sentence
or across sentence boundaries, ‘and’-coordination can be construed. The second and
following clauses are often of the verbalized sequential sentence type described in
1.1.1.4.3.3.5.

            ‘We spoke to him, (but) he does not obey.’(2) The use of contraexpective verbal modification clauses
   The only explicitly expressed ‘but’-coordination construction is the juxtaposition of a
clause manifesting the verb paxi' ‘to not find’ (meaning ‘frustrative’ in postverbal
modification position), followed by the contraexpective clause, described in 1.1.2.4.2.8.

The effect of ‘or’-coordination is accomplished in three ways.
  (1) The use of the irrealis verbal modification clause
  See 1.1.2.4.2.9, where this is described.

‘He did not talk at all, or we would have heard.’(2) The juxtaposition of mo conditional clauses, described in 1.1.2.4.2.5.
   This type of construction renders a general gloss like ‘either he will fish, or he will
hunt’.

‘Either he will fish, or he will hunt.’ (lit. ‘If he (says), “I will kill fish.” If he (says), “I will kill

animals”.)(3) The juxtaposition of clauses repeating the preverbal modifier 'am ‘finally’ or
‘perhaps’ in each clause
   This renders a gloss of ‘either he will live or he will die’.
(270) 'Am                      'e'      ca.          'Am                   mi'         pin                        ca.

        ‘Either he will live, or he will die.’ (lit. ‘Perhaps he will live. Perhaps he will die.’)
                                         1.3.1.4. ‘like’-coordination
Win ‘like’ or ‘same’ coordinates in the same way that 'ane ‘different’ (267) and 'am
‘perhaps’ (270) coordinate: win occurs as the leftmost member of a compound with the
verb of the second clause, and Tenseless VICS must be used. See (271) and 1.1.2.4.2.7,
where equative verbal modification clauses are discussed and illustrated.

‘Let’s make (do) a house right, like these non-Indians make (do) it right.’
                                      1.3.2. Number of coordinators
The only coordinating element which can be repeated for (nearly) all of the conjuncts is
an emphatic pronoun or third person form of the preposition when used to express ‘and’-
coordination of the nominal elements of the clause. In this case, all but the first element is
accompanied by a ‘coordinator’. It is possible for an emphatic pronoun to accompany the
first element, but this is rare. See (273) and (274) below.","[166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172]"

                                 0.4. COMP AND INFLIn Everett (1994), considerable space is spent railing against the notion of basic word
order. We thus avoid this term here as inaccurate both in its use of ‘basic’, as opposed to
pragmatically unmarked or syntactically underlying, and its use of ‘word’, as opposed to
constituent. The pragmatically unmarked constituent order in 'ON is vos. We do not here
consider underlying constituent order at all, aside from some brief and highly speculative
remarks in section 2.2 in the main body of the grammar. There are two basic
configurations in which vos can appear, however. The first configuration is what we call
‘simple sentences’, those in which v is the first constituent. These have the shape in (f)
(where SFP= sentence-final particle):
(f)    V VIC (NPOBJ1) (PP/NPOBJ2) (NPSUBJ) (SFP)The VIC in this configuration is almost always tensed. If it is not tensed, then tense may
appear nowhere else in the clause.
   The other configuration in which vos appears is the COMP (=complementizer) clause,
as in (g) (INFL=inflectional morpheme):
(g)   COMP INFL V VIC (NPOBJ1) (PP/NPOBJ2) (NPSUBJ) (SFP)Sentence-final particles express temporal notions and this label should thus be
straightforward and uncontroversial for all readers (assuming that they do not mind the
term ‘particle’). COMP and INFL, on the other hand, may not be so appealing to a
general readership, coming as they do from Government and Binding Theory (GB)
(Chomsky 1981,1986). Moreover, INFL itself is an outdated term in GB since at least
since Everett (1987), Pollock (1989), and Chomsky (1992) it has been assumed that what
was considered to be INFL, the head of an inflectional phrase (IP), should be instead
broken into the separate components of AGR (agreement) and T (tense). Nevertheless,
we believe that these two labels are useful mnemonic devices and that they serve better
than any others, barring detailed theoretical discussion, to express the function and syntax
of these morphemes/nodes in 'ON grammar.
   INFL expresses tense and realis/irrealis mood and agrees in gender with any material
in COMP, whether overt or covert (i.e. merely understood). Thus INFL is not exclusively
a tense/mood morpheme nor does it express the expected type of agreement with a major
grammatical relation, since it agrees with COMP, not with subject or object. Therefore,
we did not feel that it could be adequately labelled by either ‘tense’ or ‘(COMP)
agreement’. We thus stick with our label INFL here. Since such a preverbal
morpheme/clitic is extremely rare at best, no standard term will work as well as, certainly
no better than, INFL in our opinion. Thus readers may interpret our use of these terms as
                                             Wari'   8
either merely a label for a specific 'ON construction or as a GB-related claim about the
relationship between 'ON phrase structure to Universal Grammar (UG), as they wish.
    Two kinds of information appear in COMP: words which indicate moods other than
(ir)realis and question words. These thus correspond neatly to the core function predicted
of COMP in GB theory, aside from the fact that only one COMP word, the ‘third person
singular neuter’ form of the preposition, pain, serves exclusively to introduce subordinate
clauses. (For GB-oriented readers, we analyse the COMP word as occurring in the SPEC
of COMP position and INFL as, at the surface only, the head of COMP.)
    When a COMP appears, INFL is obligatory and the VICS may not be marked for
tense/mood. This is simply accounted for if we assume that tense/mood ((ir)realis mood)
must always appear in the second position of the sentence. Agreement between INFL and
COMP is also obligatory, an additional reason for INFL to immediately follow COMP in
some theoretical frameworks.
    The movement or appearance of subject or object in COMP occurs in left-
dislocation/clefted sentences, in relative clauses and in wh- (or information) questions.
An item may only appear in COMP if it is potentially referenceable on the VIC in the
sentence in question (i.e. according to the hierarchy of semantic roles above). Thus a
theme cannot be questioned, relativized, or left-dislocated if a goal NP is expressed. A
location cannot be moved to COMP if a benefactive is expressed, and so on.
Interestingly, however, there is an Anti-agreement Effect observed with fronted objects.
The VIC may not agree with an object moved to COMP. Subjects moved to COMP,
however, require agreement on the VIC, just as in the nonmoved case.

  Note that we are using these as grammatical features only. If we were using these as ‘real world’
semantic values, the results would come out wrong, since many nonhuman items in the real world
may be masculine. The three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, are simply our labels for
these feature combinations.

merely that distinguishing them here gives the reader the clearest view of how different

The only underived pronouns in the language are emphatic pronouns, discussed in the
next subsection. However, demonstrative pronouns may be used as personal pronouns, as
discussed in 2.1.2.2.

There is a distinct class of emphatic pronouns. There are no distinctions for degrees of
emphasis in this class. Emphatic pronouns occur in first, second, and third persons, in
both singular and plural forms. Note that the first person plural inclusive emphatic
pronoun, wari', is the autodenomination of the Wari' (Pacaas Novos) tribe.

appear alone or in apposition to a noun in left dislocation. They may also appear in
apposition to a noun as the object of a verb in ‘and’-coordination, where the pronoun and
accompanying appositive do not occupy the first position of the series.

                        ‘I killed a pig.’Emphatic pronouns are commonly used to mark ‘and’-coordination between nominal
elements of the clause—see 1.3.3. They may link arguments of the verb, as in (570b)
above, or they may connect a series of names given as clarification to an otherwise
complete sentence, as in (571) below. It is common for a series so marked to end with the
verb phrase ca' na ‘thus it is’ (lit. ‘this:n 3s:rp/p’). The first, second and third person
forms may be used in ‘and’-coordination expressed in a disconnected series.

‘A small knife, pills, soap, sugar, thus it was for them.’First and second person emphatic pronouns are frequently used in answer to questions of
the type, ‘Who is it?’ or to ask, ‘Is that you?’ Note that these same constructions
involving third person are given with demonstrative pronouns—see 2.1.2.2.

2.2.2.1.2.1. These are, however, rare; and have only been found in narrative text.

                                  2.1.2.2. Demonstrative pronouns
Demonstrative pronouns occur only in the third person, singular and plural. They are
formed when four proclitics (co ‘singular masculine’, cam ‘singular feminine’, 'i ‘neuter’
and caram ‘plural’) precede the demonstratives described in 1.2.5.2.5 (ca'/cwa' ‘this:n/m-
f proximate to speaker’, ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’, cain/cwain ‘that:n/m-f distal’,
paca' ‘that just occurred’, cara ne ‘that recently absent’ and cara pane ‘that long
absent’).
   These proclitics could be interpreted as prefixes; however, if they were prefixes, the
word-initial nonphonemic glottal stop on ma'                ‘that proximate to hearer’, on co
ma' ‘that masculine one proximate to hearer’ and 'i ma' ‘that neuter one proximate to
hearer’ should delete, since word-medial glottal-consonant clusters do not occur. Note
that the word-initial glottal does disappear when the INFL clitic co ‘m/f realis
past/present’ prefixes on to 'aji' ‘my older brother’ to form cwaji' ma ‘your older brother’.
In the case of cwaji' ma, co is obviously a prefix; but in the cases of co ma' and 'i ma', we
believe co and 'i must be interpreted as free clitics, and therefore that cam and caram
must also be interpreted as free clitics.

                                    1.15. MINOR SENTENCE TYPESThere are three categories of minor sentence types which diverge from the regular vos
sentence structure. These are: (1) exclamatory; (2) VIC sentences; and (3) ideophonic.
   (1) Exclamatory sentences include short, nonverbal responses of one or two words,
vocatives, and utterances consisting of noun phrases. Vocatives may also be part of
normal sentence structure.

                 ‘It is late.’ (lit. ‘(The) night (is) long ago.’)(2) VIC sentences are characterized by the presence of a VIC without a verb. The VIC
may occur alone or with a sentence-final particle (382a–b) or an inflected form of the
preposition (382c) (these three examples are responses to questions or statements); see,
however, (382d), in which there is a subject in the form of a noun clause, and (382e),
where a coordinated construction serves as the subject of the clause. The VIC sentence
appears as a direct speech in (382e). (382d–e) are ‘closures’ to discourses. Structurally, it
could be said that these sentences are the matrix clauses of complex direct speeches, i.e.
the entire discourses.

(3) Ideophonic sentences consist of sequences of (though, occasionally, individual)
onomatopoeic morphemes. They sometimes occur as constituents of compound verbs,
accompanied by VICS, in which case they can be interpreted as direct speeches. Many
recognized verbs also have an onomatopoeic ring to them, and in this connection, it can
be said that their occurrence in sequences of two or three to as many as fifteen or twenty
verbs, without VICS, are further examples of ideophonic sentences. (383) was taken from
a story of the origin of fire. The boys, in the form of birds, were carrying the fire; when
someone called them, they were startled and flew away. The ideophonic elements are in
the last sequence of paratactic clauses.

Nouns may be distinguished by the following morphological criteria: (i) they may bear
possessive suffixes or NICS—see 2.1.1.4.6; and (ii) they may be followed by any one of
the spatial/temporal demonstratives—see 1.2.5.2.5 (note that only two of the
demonstratives, ca' ‘this (neuter) proximate to speaker’ and ma' ‘that proximate to
hearer’, and one of the temporal demonstratives, cara ‘absent’, though without its
accompanying temporal particle, may follow a verb). Besides these morphological
characteristics, the following syntactic criteria apply to nouns: (iii) they may appear alone
as subject or object of the verb, (iv) they may appear as the complement of a form of the
preposition—see 1.2.4; and (v) they may occur in sequence with another noun in a
possessed NP, in which the second element (possessor) can be any noun except a derived
noun, and the first NP is marked by the possessive marking suffixes or NICS referred to
above (functioning semantically as either an actually possessed element or a nominal
modifier—see 1.2.5.2.3).","[226, 227, 228]"
"                              2.1.1.9.3. Marking of noun classes
Gender is not marked on the noun itself, but on the verbal inflectional clitic (561a–c), in
the possessive suffix (562a–c) or nominal inflectional clitic (562d–f), or by the
demonstrative following the noun (563a–c). In the latter case, a distinction is only made
between neuter versus nonneuter, i.e. the masculine and feminine distinction is
neutralized. In these cases, agreement with the gender of the noun is obligatory. Verbal
inflectional clitics are described in 2.1.3.6; genitives in 1.10; and demonstratives in
1.2.5.2.5.

The subject of an intransitive verb is (usually) marked on the VIC. (The VIC is
sometimes deleted in series of actions in discourses.) Third person subject may also be
overtly expressed by an NP—see 1.2.1.2.1. Like the direct object of a transitive verb, the
subject of an intransitive verb governs the number agreement on suppletive or
reduplicated verb forms: a plural intransitive subject requires the plural form of the
intransitive verb (a plural object requires the plural form of a transitive verb)—see
2.1.3.6.1.1. There is no distinction between subjects of intransitive verbs as agent or
nonagent.

The subject of a transitive verb is (usually) marked on the VIC. Third person subject may
also be overtly expressed by an NP—see 1.2.1.2.1. The number of the subject of a
transitive verb does not govern plural marking on the verb—see 2.3.1.6.1.1. The form of
the overtly expressed subject of a transitive verb is the same as that of an overtly
expressed direct object, unless there is an indirect object in the sentence, in which case
the (erstwhile) direct object occurs in a prepositional phrase—see 1.2.1.2.3.1. When both
subject and object are overtly expressed, the subject almost always follows the object—
see 1.2.1.2.6. There is no distinction between subjects of transitive verbs as agent and
nonagent.","[232, 233, 234]"
"                      1.1.1.1. Direct and indirect speech sentence types
Direct speech forms are common in 'ON narrative, although they are not always glossed
as literal direct speech. See 1.1.1.4.3 for a discussion of verbalized sentences, and
1.1.1.4.3.2.1 for the description of the structure of verbalized direct speech sentences.
    There is no indirect speech type in the language, though the concept can be expressed
in a direct speech present or past tense construction, in which the verbal inflectional clitic
of the matrix clause must be either plural realis past/present or plural passive, as in (1a)
and (2a) respectively. In the case of the latter, the subject of the embedded speech is
coreferential with the object of the matrix clause, and the subject of the matrix clause
must be third person plural, marked only by the VIC, not by a free-form nominal. When
such is not the case, the construction is considered a literal direct speech. The examples
in (1b) and (2b) are only acceptable if they are interpreted as direct speech. An indirect
speech interpretation would not be allowed. The embedded speech in the examples below
is italicized.

          ‘“They went”, they (say) of you.’ (not ‘They say (that) you went’.)This use of the direct speech sentence type to report indirect speech is not available with
future tense. In the past/present direct speech type constructions illustrated in (1) and (2),
the subject of the embedded speech must be coreferential with the object of an active
matrix clause or the subject of a passive clause. In future tense constructions, however,
the subject of the embedded speech must be coreferential with the subject of the matrix
clause. The ungrammatical example in (3b) is wrong for two reasons: (i) as a future tense
construction (see 1.1.1.4.3.2.2), the subject marked in the embedded clause should be
coreferential with the subject of the matrix clause (in the example, it is coreferential with
the object); and (ii) as a so-called indirect speech type, the subject marked in the matrix
clause should be third person (in the example, it is first person). (We gloss carawa as
‘animal’ throughout, because animal is more central to its meaning; but it can also mean
‘thing’.)

                                  1.1.1.2. Interrogative sentences
Interrogative sentences in 'ON belong to two separate classes: simple and COMP
sentences. See 1.1.1.4.2 for a complete discussion of interrogative sentences and their
relation to declarative sentences. The basic structure of simple yes-no and leading
questions is described in 1.1.1.2.1–2, and the basic structure of COMP question-word
questions is described in 1.1.1.4.2.
   There is only one basic intonation pattern in the language: rising pitch through the
verb, reaching high on the last syllable of the verb, and falling sharply on the next
syllable (VIC or postverbal modifier that does not carry stress); it then holds through any

demonstrative or particle and falls sharply on the demonstrative or particle (see 3.3.4). In
normal speech, the succeeding high pitch is lower than the first high pitch. When there is
emphasis, however, on an argument following the first high pitch, the pitch on the
emphasized argument is higher than the first high pitch—see 3.3.4.1–2 and 1.11.2.1.1.
Interrogative and declarative intonation patterns are basically the same, differing only in
the fact that the pitches of intonation are higher in interrogatives than in declaratives.

"                                         2.2.3.2. Nouns
Compounding is not a productive process for nouns. Nouns zero-derived from
compounded verbs may appear like compounded forms, but we analyse the compounding
as a feature of the verb prior to nominalization, rather than as a property of the noun itself
(see 2.2.3.1 for a discussion of verb compounding). There is one potential case of noun
derivation via compounding, however: the formation of subgroup names by combining
'oro ‘collective’ and the noun. But even in these cases, it seems easiest just to analyse
these as noun phrases which have been zero-derived to form nouns. The reason for this is
that we have various cases of 'oro modifying nouns in examples above, e.g. 'oro hwijima'
‘all the children’, 'oro narima' ‘all the women’ and 'oro carawa ‘all the animals’.
Subgroup names look just like such phrases formally (some clan names involve
deverbalized nouns as well), except that they are interpreted as proper names. Consider
the following:

which may be referenced in the object portion of the VIC (according to the hierarchy
given in the introduction to 1.2.1.2.3.1), there is one other use of the object VIC. We
label this use here ‘ethical dative’ agreement, since it functions like so-called ethical
dative clitics in Romance. The ethical dative references a person affected by the action of
the verb, even when that person is not actually an argument of the verb itself (i.e. is not
directly implicated by the core semantics of the verb). An example from Brazilian
Portuguese will help illustrate what we mean:
(195)          Você              me             estragou                a                    festa.
               you               to             me                      ruined               the party
               ‘You ruined the party for me.’In such examples, the ethical dative clitic (italicized) may have either a malefactive or
benefactive reading, i.e. the action may be interpreted as positive or negative for the
person referenced by the dative clitic, depending on the context. Consider the following
'ON examples, where the ethical dative clitics and their glosses are italicized:

                    ‘They are crying (over) the dead one.’In these examples, the verb does not normally take an indirect object (i.e. goal). Further,
there is no compounding required to ‘add’ an extra argument position for the NP
referenced on the VIC. This, and the fact that the interpretation of the nominal so
referenced corresponds to the interpretations available for the Romance ethical dative
clitics, suggests that the object VIC may play a similar role in 'ON. The difference is that
in 'ON, the ethical dative is marked by an affix rather than a clitic (although the affix is
part of a clitic). Therefore, since this affix position is normally ‘reserved’ for verbal
argument portions, the ethical dative reading is only possible if the verb otherwise lacks a
logical indirect object (i.e. goal). This is shown in the following:
(197) a.            *Mao             mapa'                      pain               Guajará.

                                                  Syntax        125
Otherwise, ethical datives are treated like indirect objects (in spite of the fact that they are
not what generative grammar would call ‘subcategorized arguments’ of the verb). One
could not merely analyse the ethical dative as a goal or indirect object argument of the
verb, since (i) they are always optional, whereas definite indirect objects (goals) are
obligatorily marked; and (ii) they are not part of the core meaning of the verb.","[135, 136, 137, 138]"
"Both pre- and postverbal modifiers can accompany the same verb. It is rare, however, to
find more than one of each in a single sentence. Two postverbal modifiers can occur in a
single VP if they are merely modifiers in an adverbial sense; however, no more than one

           ‘He is making a garden for us there.’Another type of verbal modification is accomplished by sentence-final temporal particles:
pa'ao' ‘afterwards, after the others go’, ne ‘recent past’, pane ‘remote past’, pacara pane
‘historic past’ and ira ‘progressive past’. All but pa' 'ao' refer to time in the past; pa’ 'ao'
can also refer to time in the past, but it refers to a future point in time relative to its
context. The use of ne, pane and pacara pane is relative to the thoughts of the speaker,
whether the action is considered to be recent, slightly remote or very remote.

"                                        1.1.1.4.1. Simple sentences
Simple sentences include declarative, imperative, and yes-no interrogative sentences.
They are distinguished from COMP and verbalized sentences by the following criteria:
1 No operator word occurs in COMP.
2 They have a simple verb structure, i.e. the verb is optionally preceded and/or followed
   by a verbal modifier, and the verb/modifier compound is then followed by one verbal
   inflectional clitic.
3 Tense VICS usually follow the verb. This is due to the fact that tense itself (with one
   exception) only appears once in the clause, in second position; see 2.1.8.2.5 and the
   discussion preceding the examples in (64) below.

             ‘The children fought each other.’As we have said, Tense VICS usually accompany the verb in simple sentences. However,
the use of a small class of verbal modifiers ('a/'ara ‘negative’, mao' ‘negative’, para
‘therefore’), one nonderived verb (win ‘to be the same’), another verb zero-derived from
a demonstrative (cain' ‘to be that (n.distal)’), and one type of sentence-final emphatic
particle (Ca'/ ma'/ne/pane 'ira and ca'/ma'/ne/pane quira) ‘emphatic particles’) requires
instead the use of Tenseless VICS (with no INFL morpheme), as shown in the sets of
examples in (58) to (63) below:
   (1) 'A/'ara and mao ‘negative’
   Note that the use of the double negative in example (58d) expresses a strong positive.

   With interrogative intonation on the sentence, the notion of ‘why?’ or ‘how?’ is
expressed.

    When used with Tense VICS, 'am and its plural/intensifier variant 'aram mean
‘finally’ (60a–b). When used with Tenseless VICS, they express the notion of ‘perhaps’
or ‘possibly’ (60c–d).

                               1.1.1.4.2. COMP sentences
COMP sentences are distinguished from simple and verbalized sentences by the
following criteria:
1 They have an overt expression in their sentence-initial position, or COMP, what we will
   refer to as ‘operator words’ or ‘COMP words’.
2 An INFL morpheme usually follows the operator word. This is because Tense must
   appear in second position of the sentence (with few exceptions, to be noted in the
   course of our discussion)—see 2.1.8.2.5.
3 Tenseless VICS usually follow the verb in the VP (there are exceptions to this, noted in
   the paragraph preceding (64) and the paragraph following (73)).
By ‘operator word’, we mean a word which sets the value of a particular logical
connective for the entire sentence, or which is interpreted logically as binding a variable
in the sentence. By ‘INFL’, we mean a preverbal word which gives information about
tense, mood and in some cases gender. That operator words are separate syntactic words,
and not prefixes, can be shown in information questions, where questioned NPS can be
placed between the operator word and INFL. Also, some operator words form
compounds with different nouns or demonstratives in preverbal positions, as shown in
some of the examples which follow ((68a), (73e–f), (74c), (82c–e)). This is also not
expected if these are prefixes. We analyse INFL as a separate morpheme, because the
language otherwise lacks prefixes, although nothing crucial for our descriptive task here
hinges on this.
   There are ten COMP words in 'ON that appear in matrix or embedded clauses, and
one, pain, that serves exclusively to introduce subordinate clauses. Some of these COMP
words also interact with certain pre-/post-verbal modifiers and verbs in order to express
different types of interrogation. These COMP words select for specific INFL morphemes
to accompany them, as discussed below. COMP words occur elsewhere in the language
in different word classes, as shown in Table 1.1, where we list each COMP word with its
basic meaning as well as the function it signals as a COMP word—see also 2.2.2.3.
‘Interrogation’ means question-word interrogation.
   Three operator words (mo, 'ac, and 'ane) can occur only with declarative intonation;
four (mon, mam, main and cain') can occur only with interrogative intonation (see,
however, 1.2.1.1, where mon, mam and main also appear with declarative intonation in
copular-type sentences); and four ma', 'om, je and pain) can occur with either declarative
or interrogative intonation. Table 1.2 illustrates this. When ma' occurs with interrogative
intonation, it asks a question-word question; when 'om and pain occur with interrogative
intonation, they ask a yes-no question; when je occurs

with interrogative intonation, the implication is a ‘why?’ or ‘why not?’ question, but the
speaker does not normally expect other than a yes or no answer.
   There are five INFL morphemes in 'ON. They appear in INFL following COMP in
COMP sentences: ca ‘neuter realis past/present’, co ‘masculine/ feminine realis
past/present’, ‘iri’ ‘realis past/present’, ta ‘realis future’, and xi ‘irrealis’. Since INFL
morphemes express tense/mood in COMP sentences (and elsewhere, in noun and relative
clauses), they may not co-occur with a Tense VIC, except as mentioned in the following
paragraph. See also 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.2.3 below. INFL morphemes indicate the gender of
the (overt or covert) word or phrase in COMP.
   While Tenseless VICS are usually the only VICS which appear in COMP sentences,
the Tense third person realis past/present VICS must occur when a masculine/feminine
subject is referenced in COMP (whether overt or covert; this does not necessarily hold for
relative clauses—see the discussion on relative clauses in 1.1.2.3, where it is shown that
in some cases, no VIC follows the verb. See also (64d) below). So, for example, a Tense
VIC is required when questioning a masculine/feminine subject, which always involves

which always involves a covert COMP (64c–d).

used. Note the ungrammatical examples in the pairs of examples below, where a Tense,

As can be seen in the examples above, object VICS are not permitted when the object is
questioned in COMP sentences. In fact, whenever an object NP is moved to the front of
the sentence, it may not be referenced on the VIC. However, subject VICS are always
required in COMP sentences. (The only exception we have noticed is Ma' xi mo cwa' ne?
‘Who will run?’ There is no Tense VIC in this example, and we have no other account
except to note that we believe it is an idiomatic construction.)

              (lit.) ‘Where are you going to it?’We now describe the use of each operator word, the INFL morpheme(s) which it selects,
and its meanings. The first example following the introduction of each operator word
illustrates the operator word in what we consider to be its basic function. The subsequent
examples illustrate its functions in COMP.
    (1) Ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’
    When ma' is followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/ present’, it
signals interrogation and expresses the notion of ‘what?’, ‘why?’ or ‘how?’ Since the
questioned element is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS follow the verb. When ma' expresses
the notion of ‘why?’, it frequently employs the use of the preverbal modifier para
‘therefore’ and/or the verb mi' ‘give’ occurring in postverbal modifier position. Both of
these verbal modifiers are optional, but one or the other is usually used in ‘why?’
questions. The three sentences in (73b–d) are synonymous and have the same
distribution, so far as we can tell. Note the examples in (73e–f), where a noun follows
ma' to form a COMP phrase and asks specifically ‘What thing do you want?’ and ‘What
day will the chief come?’ (73a) shows ma' appearing in its nonderived form as a

             ‘Where shall we work?’(5) cain' ‘that neuter distal’
    Cain' signals interrogation. It expresses the notion of ‘what?’ (as applied to a
proposition, e.g. the content of an utterance or thought), ‘when?’, ‘how?’, ‘how many?’
and ‘how long?’ Either of the INFL morphemes ca ‘neuter realis past present’ or xi
‘irrealis’ may be used, and since the questioned element is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS
are used. When cain' expresses the notion of ‘how?’, it frequently employs the use of the
verb 'ac ‘to travel’, occurring in postverbal modifier position (78d). When it expresses
the notion of ‘how many?’ or ‘how long?’, it employs the use of the verb ma' ‘to exist’
(78f–i). See 2.2.5, where we discuss the derivational process by which cain' is derived
from the demonstrative cain. See also the examples in (62), where cain' occurs as the
verb in a simple sentence. (78a) shows cain appearing as a demonstrative.

   When ‘om is followed by an INFL morpheme, it signals negation. It may be used with
declarative or interrogative intonation, in which case it asks a yes-no question. Either of
the INFL morphemes ca ‘neuter realis past present’, ta ‘realis future’, or xi ‘irrealis’ may
be used, and since the element referenced in COMP is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS are
used. See 1.4, where negation is described in detail. (79a) shows 'om appearing as a verb.

                          ‘Didn’t he go?’(7) 'ac ‘like’
   When 'ac is in COMP, it must be followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis
past/present’, it signals resemblance between two objects, and must always have
declarative intonation. Since 'ac references a nonsubject element, only Tenseless VICS
                                                 Syntax           51
may be used following the verb. An 'ac sentence is always embedded in a verbalized
sentence—see 1.1.1.4.3.3.6, where we describe verbalized comparative sentences in
detail. (80a) shows 'ac appearing as the leftmost member of a compound verb in what we
consider to be its basic use. Note that in (80a), unlike the examples which follow, a Tense
VIC follows the verb, there is no INFL, and the sentence is not embedded. Therefore we
analyse this 'ac as a verb rather than a COMP word.
(80) a.                         'Ac                     pana                   na.

                                ‘It is like a tree.’
(80) b.              'Ac        ca                                 mao     cama          na.

                     ‘It seems like she went?’(8) mo ‘conditional’
   The morpheme mo ‘conditional’ may be derived from mo ‘list presentation’. An
example of the latter is found in (81a). When mo appears in COMP, followed by an INFL
morpheme, it signals condition and must always have declarative intonation. It expresses
the notion of ‘if’. Either of the INFL morphemes ta ‘realis future’ or xi ‘irrealis’ may be
used, and since mo does not reference the subject, Tenseless VICS are used. See
1.1.2.4.2.5, where we discuss condition sentences in detail, and 1.1.1.4.3.3.1, where we
discuss condition sentences appearing in a verbalized sentence.

                     ‘If he would go.’(9) je ‘third person neuter emphatic pronoun’
   When je appears in COMP position, it may be used to express affirmation or
interrogation. When je is followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past present’
or ta ‘realis future’, it has declarative intonation and signals affirmation. When followed
by the INFL morpheme xi ‘irrealis’, it has interrogative intonation and is used to elicit an
agreement from the hearer. Since je does not reference the subject, it may only co-occur
with Tenseless VICS (as in (82b–e) below). When it is followed by ta or xi, it often
employs the use of the postverbal modifier qui' ‘coming this way’. Note the examples in
(82c–e), where a demonstrative pronoun follows je in COMP to form a COMP phrase;
note also the examples in (82g–h), where the gloss of the irrealis constructions is
affirmation (i.e. ‘So you should have talked to me’ and ‘He should not have gone’), but
the implication is that the speaker is asking the hearer for agreement. (82a) shows je
appearing in its nonderived form as an emphatic pronoun. As with all other cases above,
this illustrates what we consider to be its basic use. See also 1.11.2.1.3, on pseudoclefts
and other emphatic pronouns in COMP.

occurs in COMP. BK also thinks she has heard other examples like this. This
phenomenon may have nothing to do with je 'i ma'; there are other instances of INFL
deleting when the verb is reduplicated—see discussion and examples in 2.2.4.1.2. (83a)

   'Ane signals contraexpectation and must always have declarative intonation. It is not
followed by an INFL morpheme when the VP is headed by a nonderived verb. It is
followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/present’ when the VP is headed by
a verbalized noun. The sentence-final particle ne ‘recent past’ must always occur. (85a)
shows 'ane appearing as a verb, which we consider to be its basic use. (85b–c) illustrate
the use of 'ane as a COMP word, where it means ‘but’ or ‘because’. See 1.1.2.4.2.8,
where we discuss contraexpectives in detail.

nonderived noun.

which it means ‘long ago’. Although the surface structure looks like a regular COMP
sentence, we question, however, whether it could really be described as such. In order to
express the notion of ‘long ago’, exaggerated emphasis must be applied to pain.

                                 1.1.1.4.3. Verbalized sentences
1.1.1.4.3.1. Introduction By ‘verbalized sentences’, we mean to refer to those sentences
in which the predicate is manifested by one of the derived predicate types described in
this section. Strictly speaking, of course, the verbalized sentence is only the derived
predicate itself. However, due to the range of functions peculiar to this construction type,
we will refer to the construction as a whole as a ‘verbalized sentence’, and hope that this
does not cause undue confusion for the reader. The derived predicate of verbalized
sentences can often be interpreted as an embedded speech, but not always. Verbalized
sentences fall into two groups. The first group includes direct speech, future tense
constructions, supposition, and purpose sentences. The distinguishing characteristic of
this group is that their derived predicates have the form of a quotation. The second group
includes conditional, desiderative, refusal, sequential and comparative sentences. These
differ from the first group in that either the embedded portion would not be a well-formed
sentence on its own, or the form of the construction as a whole is not that of a quotative
sentence.
   Verbalized sentences have one common denominator: the derived predicate is a
sentence that has been verbalized, that is, the entire embedded clause is treated
phonologically and morphosyntactically as a single verb. This verbalization of the
embedded clause is manifested by the following syntactic and phonological changes:
(a) The embedded clause occurs in the verb position of the matrix clause.
(b) The embedded verbalized sentence may undergo modification, inflection and
   compounding just like any other verb.
                                              Wari'   56
(c) Only the last syllable of the embedded sentence carries primary stress, just as the last
   syllable of a verb compound carries primary stress. (This would violate the normal
   stress rule that places primary stress on the final syllable of each word, were it not for
   the fact that the embedded sentence is now a single verb.)
The matrix clause of verbalized sentences is not marked in any special way. In general,
any of the Tense or Tenseless verbal inflectional clitics may be used. Restrictions on their
use, as well as the basic structure of each verbalized sentence type, are described below.
    1.1.1.4.3.2. Group I verbalized sentences The derived predicate of Group I
verbalized sentences is interpretable as a quotation. The derived predicates are italicized
in the examples in this section.
    1.1.1.4.3.2.1. Verbalized direct speech sentences: The verbal element of direct speech
sentences consists of the embedded sentence. The constituent order of the matrix clause
is:
    0 speech verb+Tense VICwhich marks the addressee and speaker as the object and subject of the sentence. The
order of the arguments and adjuncts of the matrix clause is the same as that of simple and
COMP sentences.

   1.1.1.4.3.2.2. Verbalized future tense constructions: The constituent order of the
derived predicate of verbalized future tense constructions is:
   v+1s/1pincl rf VIC+opt o/adjunctThe constituent order of the matrix clause of these sentences is:
                                                            Syntax         57
   rp/p or rf VIC+argumentsThe last syllable of the derived predicate, that is, the word preceding the realis
past/present or future verbal inflectional clitic, carries primary stress. The verbalized
future tense construction is preferred over the use of realis future verbal inflectional
clitics alone to express future tense.
    Only first person singular or plural inclusive realis future verbal inflectional clitics can
occur in the derived predicate (i.e. the embedded sentence) of verbalized future tense
constructions. Either realis past/ present or realis future verbal inflectional clitics can
occur in the matrix clause. The VIC in the matrix clause marks the subject of the future
tense construction as a whole, since the subject marked in the derived predicate and that
marked in the matrix clause are always coreferential (this contrasts with an indirect
speech interpretation (see 1.1.1.1), in which the subject of the derived predicate is always
coreferential with the object of the matrix clause). The subject NP must occur externally,
as illustrated below in (89).

are as follows:
   (i) Object VICS (of matrix or embedded clauses) can always be omitted with
indefinite objects, as per their behaviour in all clauses (see 1.2.5.2.4).

used to express mistaken speculation or expectation of the speaker. The constituent order
of the derived predicate of verbalized supposition sentences when third person is marked
on the embedded VIC is:
   v+3s/p rf VIC (+o or S NP)+postvm ma' ‘that:prox:hearer’Note that only a third person singular or plural VIC may occur in the embedded clause,
whether referring to third person or second person. The constituent order of the matrix
clause is:
   rp/p VIC+opt argumentsOnly realis past/present verbal inflectional clitics can be used in the matrix clause, and
only third person realis future VICS can be used in the derived predicate. The subject
marked in the derived predicate is always coreferential with the object marked in the
matrix clause.
    The embedded clause may contain an NP subject or an NP direct object but not both.
If an NP direct object appears in the embedded clause, then an NP subject may not appear
there—see (100g–h). A VIC within the embedded clause, referencing the subject, is
always obligatory however. This embedded VIC coreferences the object of the matrix
clause, whether it is overt or merely understood. Since the postverbal modifier ma'
belongs to the class of postverbal modifiers that do not carry stress when occurring in a
verb compound, the last syllable of the word preceding it carries primary stress—see
1.2.1.3.1.1.

1.1.1.4.3.3. Group II verbalized sentences The derived predicate of Group II verbalized
sentences differs from Group I verbalized sentences in that either it would not serve as a
well-formed sentence on its own, or the sentence in which it is embedded could not be
interpreted as a quotation. The derived predicates in the examples of this section are
italicized.
    1.1.1.4.3.3.1. Verbalized conditional sentences: The derived predicate of verbalized
conditional sentences consists of a COMP irrealis condition sentence illustrated in the
example in (81c) and discussed in 1.1.2.4.2.5. Only COMP condition sentences
containing the irrealis INFL morpheme xi appear in verbalized conditional sentences. The
constituent order of the embedded clause is:
    COMP xi condition clause+postvm xi' ‘dubitative’The matrix clause consists merely of the third person realis past/present VIC na. Since xi'
‘dubitative’ belongs to the class of postverbal modifiers that do not carry stress in a verb
compound, the word preceding xi' carries primary stress.

   rp/p VIC+opt arguments/adjunctsOnly irrealis verbal inflectional clitics may be used in desiderative sentences. Primary
stress falls on the last syllable of the verbal element, that is, na ‘to consent’, not to be
confused with the third person singular realis past/present verbal inflectional clitic na.
The verb na forms a compound verb with the embedded verbalized clause (see 2.2.3).
The VIC in the formula above must be either first person singular or plural, or third
person singular or plural.

of verbalized refusal sentences is:
and the constituent order of the matrix clause is:
Verbalized refusal sentences are similar to verbalized desiderative sentences, in that the
verb na ‘to consent’ forms a verb compound with their derived predicates. They differ,
however, in the verbal inflectional clitics that can be used in their derived predicates.
Desideratives use only irrealis VICS; refusals use only the second person singular realis
future VIC. The use of verbalized refusal sentences is very limited. We have only
recorded them embedded in a COMP negation sentence. We have not recorded any
examples with an NP object in the derived predicate. Moreover, since only second person
can be used as the subject of the derived predicate, they never have an NP subject. The
subject of the matrix clause is coreferential with the subject of the embedded clause.
Primary stress falls on the last syllable of the derived predicate, i.e. the verb na ‘to
consent’.

Verbalized emphatic sentences are similar to verbalized desiderative and refusal
sentences, in that they all employ the verb na ‘to consent’ in their derived predicates.
Verbalized emphatic sentences are distinguished from the other two by the obligatory use
of the demonstrative ma' in embedded clause, and the second person realis VIC, together
with the ‘dubitative’ particle in the matrix clause. The choice of the singular or plural
VIC in the matrix clause is determined by the number of persons addressed. This
construction could be loosely translated, in addition to the derived predicate, as ‘…and
you better believe it’, or ‘…you can say that again’. Primary stress falls on the verb na.
(See 1.1.2.4.2.1(2) for a complete discussion of the ‘dubitative’ particle xi'.)

predicate of verbalized sequential sentences is:

                                                    Syntax           69
The person of sequential sentence types is found in the Tenseless or reflexive verbal
inflectional clitics in the derived predicate (which has no tense/ mood marked in it); the
tense/mood of sequential sentences is found in the verbal inflectional clitic of the matrix
clause. Only third person singular Tense verbal inflectional clitics (na ‘realis
past/present’, tara ‘realis future’, or xira ‘irrealis’) may occur in the matrix clause. The
choice of 'ac ‘to travel’ or mao ‘to go (s)’ in the derived predicate seems to be based on
idiolectical preference.
   When there is an overt object or subject of the sentence, it usually follows the derived
predicate, just as the object or subject follows the verb of a simple sentence; however,
about 50 per cent of the time, the overt object may occur inside the derived predicate of
verbalized sequential sentences, in which case its last syllable carries primary stress. The
overt subject never occurs inside the derived predicate of verbalized sequential sentences.
Whether the overt object occurs inside or outside the derived predicate seems to be a
choice of stylistic preference. The use of the verbalized sequential sentence is a common
way to begin a narrative discourse. The derived predicate is italicized in the following
examples:

comparative sentences is the COMP comparison sentence described in 1.1.1.4.2 and
illustrated in the examples in (80). Unlike other COMP sentences, which can occur alone
as utterances, the COMP comparison sentence cannot occur alone as an utterance; it can
only be used when in its verbalized sentence form.
    The constituent order of the derived predicate of verbalized comparative sentences is:
COMP comparison sentence+pvm ma' ‘that:prox:hearer’ + opt arguments. The
constituent order of the matrix clause is:
The only verbal inflectional clitic that can occur in the matrix clause of verbalized
comparative sentences is the third person singular realis past/ present morpheme na. If
both an object and subject are expressed, the object NP may occur inside or outside of the
derived predicate, but the subject NP must occur outside. If no object NP is expressed,
the subject NP may occur inside the derived predicate. No NP can occur simultaneously
within the derived predicate and matrix clause. The derived predicate is italicized in the
following examples:

                                             constructions
The derived predicate of verbalized sentences may be embedded in various constructions,
including other verbalized sentences. Each embedded derived predicate is marked by
primary stress on its last syllable. However, when this is embedded into another derived
predicate, the primary stress then becomes secondary stress. Thus, primary stress on the
verb goes only on the final syllable of the least embedded predicate. In the following
examples, primary stress is shown by [1] and secondary stress is shown by [2]. The most
deeply embedded derived predicates are italicized, and the dominating derived predicate
or clause is in brackets. In (113b) and (113h), where there are three cases of embedding,
the surface predicate is in parentheses. Degree of embedding is signalled by, among other
things, the number of VICS. There is only one VIC per clause, therefore, two VICS
indicate one level of embedding, three indicate two levels of embedding, etc.

Subordinate clauses in 'ON consist of noun clauses, relative clauses, and verbal
modification (adverb) clauses. Some types of relative constructions are actually derived
nouns rather than subordinate clauses. See 2.2.1, where we discuss the similarity between
derived nouns and noun and relative clauses. There are no general markers that apply to
all types of subordination. See the following subsections for the markers of each type of
subordination.

Copular sentences do not exist. This notion is expressed by what would be the nominal,
adjectival, or adverbial complement of a copular appearing as the verb of the sentence.
The element in the verbal position is accompanied by a VIC like any verb, so that to say,
for example, ‘the baby is a man (male)’, ‘the house is small’, or ‘the boy is fast’, one
says, ‘the baby mans (males)’, ‘the house smalls’, and ‘the boy fasts’. Nouns may be
zero-derived, i.e. occur in the verb position without any morphological changes (167a), or
a noun may occur as a derived verb as described in 2.2.2.1.2.2 by using one of its
inflections (167b–c). The notion of adverbial is expressed by a regular verb (167d).

                 ‘The child is fast.’ (lit. ‘The child fasts.’)One might attempt to dispute our analysis of the above clauses, arguing instead that the
VIC is acting as a copular verb and that the material on both sides of it is nominal,
functioning as a predicate adjective/nominal. However, there are at least five reasons to
reject this analysis in favour of the analysis in the text, namely, that the material to the
left of the VIC is in fact a zero-derived verb. The reasons are as follows:
(a) Nouns appearing to the left of the VIC are interpreted descriptively (but predicatively)
   in the second and third person forms, but actively or even agentively in their first
   person form.
(b) These apparent nominals may be compounded with verbs or verbal modifiers.
(c) When compounded, they may undergo semantic drift.
(d) When nonfinal in a compound, a nominal may not bear primary stress (unless
   followed by a stress-rejecting modifier).
(e) These noun-verb compounds may be preceded by COMP+INFL sequences.
Moreover, if material to the left of VICS in these ‘copular’ constructions was nonverbal,
this would be the only case in the language where a VIC attaches to nonverbal material.
Segments (a)–(e) are discussed in detail in section 2.2.
    The closest thing to a copular construction is a nonverbal sentence in which the
demonstrative ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’, or one of its variants (mon ‘singular
masculine’, momon ‘plural masculine’, mam ‘singular feminine’, mamam ‘plural
feminine’, and main ‘neuter'), or an emphatic pronoun, occurs in the sentence-initial
position, optionally followed by a demonstrative and an NP (which may take the form of
a noun derived from a sentence (168h)). There is no overt be-copula. The demonstrative
in the NP is not obligatory, though it usually occurs.

Most 'ON sentences are manifested (overtly at least) by the verb only. The occurrence of
one argument with the VP (either the expressed object, subject, or some other
constituent) is common, but the occurrence of two arguments is fairly uncommon. More
than two arguments can occur, but this is even rarer.","[124, 125, 126, 127, 128]"

                   ‘Sing until they come.’ (lit. ‘Sing-come them.’)These lead us to conclude that compounds are left-headed and left-branching:

2.2.3.1.2.1. Serial vs compounding One plausible alternative to our compounding
analysis would be to treat these as serial verbs rather than compound verbs. However, this
analysis does not seem to be what is wanted here for semantic, syntactic and
phonological reasons. Semantically, serial verb constructions should maintain the basic
translation of each verb in the string, rarely ‘adding’ them together at the end. This
indeed does seem to work for examples like (733):
(733)      Juc        wao            ron                coxa'                                                  ma.
                                     ra-on              co-xa'

           ‘Swing your little brother.’You push your little brother and you (by pushing) swing him. But now notice the
problem if we add the verb pi'am ‘sleep’ to this.
(734)      Juc        wao           pi'am      ron                coxa'
                                               ra-on              co-xa'

           ma.
           2s
           ‘Swing your little brother to sleep.’There is a clear causative meaning to the verb pi'am (and arguably to wao ‘swing’ as
well) in (734). If these were merely serial verbs, one might expect them all to ‘unify’ (à
la Baker 1988), where they all shared the same subject. But in its non-
serial/noncompound use, sleep could only have as its subject coxa' ma ‘your little
brother’, not ‘you’ as it does here. Consider too the case of an intransitive verb
compounded with/followed by a transitive verb:
(735)             Com                taxipa'                       nana                    hwijima'.
                  sing               befriend                      3p:rp/p                 children
                  ‘The children customarily sing.’Taxipa' ‘befriend’ would otherwise be a transitive verb. Used following an intransitive
verb, however, it never has this transitive meaning but only the modificational, aspectual
meaning ‘customarily’. This type of semantic drift is typical of compounding, but not of
incorporation. In the examples which follow, this type of semantic drift, or
noncompositionality, is manifested in varying degrees.

                             ‘Then he touched it.’In example (736d), 'ac ‘travel’ is interpreted as a sequential aspect, rather than a separate
verb ‘to travel’. This type of fact is compatible with either a compounding or suffixation
analysis (where morphemes can function as verbs or aspectual suffixes depending on
                                           Morphology             373
their position in the word), but not, it seems to us, with a simple serial verb structure.
Other more extreme examples are:
(737) a.     Tomi'            querec             te                     napa'                      pije'.
                                                                        na-pa'

             ‘The child is happy (lit. ‘speaks, sees and says “My father”) with me.’
(737) b.               Mi'                 pin                                        na.

                       ‘He died (lit. gave completely).’
(737) c.         Xiram                                     pa'               napa'.
                                                                             na-pa'
                 press:down                                upon              3s:rp/p-1s
                 ‘He feels sorry for (lit. presses down upon) me.’Such semantic drift is expected under a compounding analysis, but not under a
suffixation nor a serial verb analysis.
   Phonologically, a string of independent words would receive stress on each word in
the string. In the verbs above, however, this is not the case. Primary stress is placed only
on the final verb of the string (with the verbs to the left receiving very light secondary
stresses at most). If these form a single compound verb (or affixed verb), this is to be
expected. It is harder to account for by a serial verb analysis. (At least it is less
economical, since we need compounding already to handle semantically opaque cases
like those in (737), and the ‘serial verb’ construction would be formally identical.)
   Syntactically, the verbs in a serial verb construction should share the same subject.
That is not the case here, however, if we merely take the literal meaning of each verb:
(738)      Querec        querec           mao           'inon                    cawiji         pane.
                                                        'ina-on
           see           see              go:s          1s:rp/p-3sm              son:1s         rem:past
           ‘I saw my son off long ago.’ (lit. ‘I saw-went my son long ago.’)This sentence can be uttered even when the speaker (the subject referenced on the VIC)
does not go anywhere. It is the son that is doing the going in (738), not the speaker. At
the same time, however, the speaker is not causing the son to go, so a simple causative
analysis would miss the mark. A compound analysis can handle this by assuming that the
second verb is the result or object of the first, forming a single complex event of seeing
and going of which the subject is the ‘seer’ (because as leftmost verb, ‘see’ will be the
head of the compound and thus determine the subject of the verb, while the subject of
‘go’, the son, will be the object of the compound verb). In other words, while this has the
superficial form of a causative, it is in fact a new, compound verb. Consider the case of a
plural object:
(739)      Querec      querec          mama'          'inonon             'oro      wari'        pane.
                                                          Wari'      374
                                                                'ina-ocon
           see               see              go:p              1s:rp/p-3pm                coll    person         rem:past
           ‘I saw the people off long ago.’ (lit. ‘I saw-went the people long ago.’)Here the suppletive plural form of the verb ‘to go’, mama', is used. This follows if the
construction in (739) is either a serial construction or a compound, since in the former
case, 'oro wari' 'the people' is the subject of mama' ‘to go’, and in the latter case, it is the
object of the entire verb compound, querec querec mama'. But the compound analysis is
again preferred, since without it, we would have to allow for a sequence of verbs
inflected as one, but with different subjects. We conclude, therefore, based on semantics,
syntax and phonology that multiverbal complexes in 'ON are verb compounds and not
serial verbs. Before concluding, however, we also want to argue that our compounding
analysis is also superior to an incorporation analysis.
   2.2.3.1.2.2. Incorporation vs compounding Some structures which we have analysed
as zero-derivation plus compounding, might instead be analysed as incorporation. (We
will ignore the possibility of verbal incorporation here, since this would be nearly
equivalent to a serial verb analysis, already rejected.) Consider (740):

                          ‘The motor turned upside down.’

             that:prox:hearer
             ‘The waram monkey had a short tail (lit. played around at having a tail).’However, we can safely reject this analysis, based on examples like (741):

               ‘To'o, as a woman, toasted farinha.’In the above examples, there is no possible verb-external source for the incorporated N. It
cannot be the object, since that position is filled. Nor could the incorporated N have
plausibly originated as possessor of the object. Thus we reject incorporation as the source
of the compound verbs in (740)–(741), analysing them instead by (i) zero-derivation of
the ‘nominal’ part of the compound ([N]→[V[N]]), followed by (ii) compounding.
   Yet another argument against incorporation comes from our earlier discussion of zero-
derivation of verbs from nouns (see 2.2.2.1.2.2). The form of the noun which appears to
the left of the VIC is not predictable from anything to the right of the VIC, i.e. cannot be
predicted via movement into the verb from pre-existent deep structure. Moreover, the
form of the noun which appears in the verb affects the translation of the compound or
simple denominalized verbs in only roughly predictable ways, much more easily
accounted for by compounding, whose semantics are often less than fully compositional,
than by incorporation, which, at least by Baker’s (1988) account, would be expected to be
fully compositional, with no semantic drift at all. We therefore reject incorporation as an
analysis of the above verb forms.","[382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389]"

Foreign words are used exclusively in their singular form. Number is marked on them in
the same way it is marked on native vocabulary.

                             2.1.1.9. Division of nouns into classes
Nouns are divided into distinct grammatical classes by three features:
feature                  Value
gender                   masculine/feminine/neuter
possession               alienable/inalienable/unpossessable
animacy                  human/nonhuman
                          2.1.1.9.1. Distinguishing affixes or markers
There are no distinguishing characteristics to mark gender or humanness/nonhumanness
on a noun; they are distinguished semantically and/or elsewhere in the clause via
agreement.
   There are two sets of nouns that have inalienable possession. The -xi’ noun class is
marked by the set of inflected possessive suffixes (554a). The other class is a set of
derived kinship terms. The ‘verb’ of the kinship term is the first person singular form of
                                            Morphology    287
the kinship term, and it has the form of a quote (554b), with the possessor having the
form of a subject. See 2.1.1.4.6.1 and 2.2.2.2.1.5, where these two classes of nouns
having inalienable possession are described in detail.

              2.1.1.9.2. Characterization of the class meanings of each class
Division of nouns into classes by gender is determined semantically. Human females are
the only members that belong to the feminine gender class. However, mixed gender
groups (that is, including both males and females), collective nouns (e.g. ‘children’ or
‘siblings’ when males and females are included) are also treated as feminine gender class,
and groups of people including both males and females are also referred to with feminine
markers. The nouns in the examples in (555a–b) are feminine; 'oro wari' in (555c) is
treated as feminine because it is a mixed gender group.

                     ‘I saw the people (both men and women).’All remaining nouns are divided between the masculine and neuter gender classes.
Although gender is not marked overtly on nouns, their gender may be marked elsewhere
in the clause. The masculine gender class includes all human males and about half of the
culturally significant animals and objects. By ‘culturally significant’, we mean animals
and objects that were familiar to the Wari' before their contact with civilization, or that
played an important role in their pre-contact world view. These include about half of the
small fish, birds, animals and insects; some large fish; about half of the bees; some useful
objects; some phenomena of nature; and about half of large game animals. The examples
in (556) belong to the masculine gender class.

which were not familiar to the Wari' before their contact with civilization. It also includes
small fish, birds, animals, insects and large game animals indigenous to the Wari' area not
included in the masculine gender class. Finally, all subordinate clauses and derived nouns
are neuter in gender. All of the constructions in (557) belong to the neuter gender class.

inalienable possession.

possession. Many body parts also have an unpossessable form. Kinship terms do not have
nonpossessed forms.

                  ‘Why are you angry with each other (or yourselves)?’The postverbal modifier caracan ‘each other’ is often used in conjunction with the
reflexive (reciprocal) VICS to explicitly express reciprocality.
(332)               Mana'                caracan                         xequequem.

                    ‘They are angry with each other.’Reciprocals, reflexives, and passive constructions all share a common discourse
function—they reduce the topicality difference between the agentas-subject and the
object-as-patient (goal, theme, etc.). The passive (see 2.1.3.1.1) does this by promoting
the agreement expressed as an object in the active construction to the subject of the
passive. The agent is removed, i.e. is not expressed overtly, in a passive clause.
Reciprocals and reflexives reduce the topicality of the agent-as-subject by equating agent
with the object upon which it acts in the VIC. That is, a reflexive/reciprocal VIC
eliminates the subject-object distinction by failing (like the passive, but unlike the active)
to distinguish between subject and object in agreement. Since 'ON lacks case marking
and only distinguishes between subject and (primary) object via the VIC (other objects
are marked by the preposition), obliteration of any subject-object VIC distinction
effectively means that subject=object topically and semantically. This in effect increases
the relative prominence of nonsubject arguments. So for example, in (333), the duck
referenced by con ‘prep:3sm’ is the topic of the paragraph from which (333) was taken.
In the (embedded) clause in which it occurs, there is no distinctive reference to the
subject, only the reflexive VIC.

‘“Give it to me, I will raise (it)”, (said) Maxun. He took it from him.’ (lit. ‘…they took it from each
other.’)In (334), dead people cannot be agents and so dead people cannot be expressed in the
most highly topical agent-as-subject form. But the reciprocal translation (‘they did not eat
each other’) obliterates the syntactic distinction between subject (the ones doing the
eating) and the object (the dead people). The use of reflexive/reciprocal here promotes
‘dead people’ to the role of grammatical actor, indicating that it is in focus. (334) is from
a report of several deaths during the initial contact with non-Indian society. Note the use

   Such verbs as tiquin' mao ‘to continue on’, tiquin' ca' ‘to pass up’, juc 'in pin ‘to push
away’, and the preverbal modifier 'amon ‘diminutive’, all help express the notion of
comparative. Sentences using these verbs and preverbal modifier are still often
accompanied by the juxtaposition of similar or contrasting sentences. See (336b) for an
example of the preverbal modifier 'amon expressing comparison.

                           ‘Did you come?’First and second person pronominal subjects are often heard in exchanges between
outsiders and the Wari', however we consider this to be merely a form of ‘mission
language’. The use of first and second person pronominal subjects is never observed in
exchanges strictly among the Wari' themselves. Third person subject may, however, be
expressed by a demonstrative pronoun, as well as a VIC, as in (176).

           ‘They arrived here.’ (lit. ‘Those masculine/feminine ones over there arrived here.’)The subject VIC may be omitted entirely in long discourses describing series of actions—
see 1.12, where the occurrence of verbs without VICS is a device used to signal events on
the main thematic line of a discourse. Example (177) is taken from a text about the origin
of corn. Note the direct speeches in this example, in which the VICS marking the subject
of the nonexistent ‘said’ verb are also omitted.

               3.5. MORPHOPHONOLOGY (SUPRASEGMENTAL)Stress always occurs on the last (rightmost) syllable of the (grammatical) word, even if
that syllable is a suffix. Stress also falls on the last syllable of derived predicates in
verbalized sentences, as our analysis of these as single verbs predicts. In this sense, it
could be said that stress is constant under morphological processes.

                      Ideophones and Interjections                                     4.1. IDEOPHONESWe understand ideophones to be words which are partially onomatopoeic, may involve
reduplication, and (unlike merely onomatopoeic words) respect the general phonological
patterns of the language. Many verbs and nouns, especially names of animals, birds, fish
and some objects, are ideophones. In the case of verbs, they represent the sound produced
when the action takes place; in the case of nouns, they represent the sound the animal,
bird, fish, or object makes. These ideophones are treated formally like other nouns and
verbs. They may head NPS/VPS like any other noun or verb, being accompanied by
inflectional clitics, demonstratives and collective particles where applicable (the
preceding material is full of examples). In addition, many verbal ideophones undergo
regular reduplication processes to form plural, intense verbs.
   The (incomplete) list of verbal and nominal ideophones below was taken from the 'ON
dictionary:

Kinship terms are obligatorily possessed (although the first person singular possession
suffix of co- terms is covert). While the first person singular inflection of all kinship
terms is used in vocatives, the term of endearment, 'arain ‘lit. its bone’, is preferred when
addressing anyone whom ego calls ‘child’, ‘son’, or ‘daughter’. The first person singular
inflection of kinship terms appears as a derived verb, as shown below. See 2.2.2.1, where
we describe the first person singular inflections of nouns functioning as derived verbs.

        to her?’)
(841) b. Te                   non                          Xijam                'Orowao'.

         ‘Xijam is ‘Orowao'’s father.’ (‘'Orowao' “father’s” (lit. (says) “my father” to) Xijam.’)When talking about a relative, ego uses the first person singular inflection of the kinship
term. When two or more people talk about a person with whom they are related in the
same way, the first person plural inclusive inflection of the kinship term is used. This
includes siblings (both brothers and sisters): when talking about one of the sister’s
children, the term for female ego’s child (children) is used; when talking about one of the
brother’s children, the term for male ego’s child is used. When two people talk about a
mutual relative with whom they are not related in the same way, the term describing the
closest relationship to one of them is used. A husband and wife always refer to their child
(children) as pije' ‘child’ (hwijima' ‘children’) when talking to each other. In-laws also
use pije' and hwijima' when speaking to their wife’s/husband’s relatives about their child.
   Kinship terms belong to two word classes. The glosses of the terms listed below are
only their basic meaning. These terms also include broader relationships, crossing
generation levels—see the discussions and lists in 5.1.1.1–3.

                             5.1.1.1–2. Sanguineal relationships
The purpose of this description is only to identify and define the kinship terminology, and
not to analyse the kinship system in depth. However, a brief discussion of how the system
works will help one to easily identify and define the terms. In the following guidelines,
‘actual generation level’ means the same genealogical rank or remove from a common
ancestor; and ‘theoretical generation level’ means two or more actual generation levels
that share kinship terms normally thought to be used on the same actual generation level.
   In the kinship charts and discussions in 5.1.1.1–3, the following abbreviations are
used: F ‘father’, M ‘mother’, B ‘brother’, Z ‘sister’, e ‘elder than ego’, y ‘younger than
ego’, s ‘son’, D ‘daughter’, c ‘child’, H ‘husband’, and w ‘wife’.
   Guidelines to be considered in order to identify and define the kinship terminology are
as follows:
1 Any ego considers father’s brother the same as father (te) and mother’s sister the same
   as mother (na'); therefore parallel cousins are the same as siblings, and any child of
   one whom ego’s father calls brother, or ego’s mother calls sister, is a sibling ('aji'
   ‘elder brother’, we ‘elder sister’, xa' ‘younger sibling’, xere ‘siblings’).
                                       Lexicon    427
2 The children of anyone whom male ego calls brother, or female ego calls sister, are
   ego’s children (panxita' ‘my child (male ego)’, cawiji ‘my son (female ego)’, caina
   ‘my daughter (female ego)’, humaju ‘my children (female ego)’).
3 A woman considers her brother ('aji'/xa') to be on the same theoretical generation level
   as her own children; therefore her children (ego) consider mother’s brother the same
   as elder brother ('aji', though see (4) below), and his children and grandchildren are
   ego’s children (panxita' ‘my child’, or panxica 'aji' ‘my elder brother’s child’) and
   grandchildren (wina ‘grandson’ and jina ‘granddaughter’) respectively. This principle
   also extends to the second ascending actual generation level: although mother’s
   mother’s brother is called jeo' ‘grandfather’, he is considered the same as ego’s
   brother (and thus on his same theoretical generation level); his children are considered
   ego’s children (panxita' ‘my child’, or panxica jeo' ‘my grandfather’s child’), and they
   call each other’s children’s children grandchildren.
4 Likewise, male ego considers his sister to be on a theoretical generation level above
   himself, proven by the fact that he considers her son (wixi) the same as his brother:
   their children are siblings, and they call each other’s children’s children grandchildren.
   The theoretical generation level breaks down, however, with male ego’s sister’s
   daughter (nowin): although she refers to him as ‘elder brother’, he calls her children
   grandchildren.
5 Any ego considers father’s sister the same as elder sister (we), and all of father’s
   sister’s direct line female descendants ad infinitum are the same as elder sister (we).
   This deviates from (2) above, where female ego’s sister’s children are also considered
   her own children.
6 As soon as father’s sister or any of her direct line female descendants (FZD, FZDD,
   FZDDD, etc.) has a son, he is considered the same as father (te) and occupies the same
   theoretical generation level as ego’s own father. The children of this “father” are ego’s
   siblings (and thus on his own theoretical generation level).
7 Anyone whom ego’s father calls father or mother, or ego’s mother calls father, is ego’s
   grandparent (jeo'); anyone whom ego’s mother calls mother, or ego’s father calls
   father’s sister (whether FZ, FZD, FZDD, FZDDD, etc.) is ego’s maternal grandmother
   pa').
8 Anyone whom ego’s child calls child is ego’s grandchild (wina, jina, wiji').
With this discussion as a background, we will now present each kinship term in order of
descendency (first grandparents, then parents, siblings, children, and grandchildren).
Although the Wari' people keep track of kinship up to the third theoretical ascending and
descending generation, their reasoning and terms are the same as for the second
theoretical ascending and descending generations, i.e. a parent of one whom ego calls
grandparent is also grandparent, and a child of one whom ego calls grandchild is also
grandchild, with one exception—while female ego’s ss and so is wiji, sss and SDS is
wina and SSD and SDD is jina—see the footnote on (21) in the list of relationships that
follows. The specific relationships listed below are exhaustive to the second actual
ascending and descending generations.

                                  1.11.2.1.1. Emphasis by stress
Constituent emphasis may only occur on verb stems and nouns of the sentence. It is
commonly expressed by increased intensity and higher pitch on the stressed syllable of
the constituent marked by [1] in the examples below. Emphasis by stress is not permitted
on VICS. Note the ungrammatical example in (361c). Such emphasis must be expressed
by either the emphatic postverbal modifier pan, described in 1.11.2.1.2, or by the
movement of the emphasized element to the beginning of the sentence as an emphatic
pronoun, as described in 1.11.2.1.3.

                               1.11.2.1.2. Emphatic verbal modifier
The postverbal modifier pan indicates emphasis on the subject. There is not normally any
undue change of stress or pitch on the subject when pan is used. The function of pan is to
clarify the identity of the subject in a particular context. In the following example, it was
not clear from the preceding context for all the interlocutors, who had danced.

                ‘The children danced.’Pan also has a potentially related meaning, which includes the notion of ‘now’, ‘at the
moment’, or ‘for the time being’. It seems to ask for clarification about location (363a) or
give clarifying information about location (363b).

                               1.11.2.1.3. Emphasis by movement
Subjects and objects occur postverbally in all regular clauses, and movement within the
clause is rare. There is, however, a means of expressing emphasis on the subject or object
by the use of emphatic pronouns followed by relative clauses. The emphasized element
occurs in (or ‘is moved to’) initial position in the sentence, i.e. COMP, as in (364).
   When the emphasized element is the subject, it is also expressed anaphorically in the
VIC of the relative clause (364b). The effect of this sentence type is equivalent to clefting
in English. Note that the example in (364a) is, in fact, a kind of copular sentence—see
1.2.1.1.
(364) a.   Je                'i ma'                       ca              tomi'          xim       ne.

            ‘It was Xijam who planted corn.’Alternatively, an emphatic pronoun with or without an appositional NP (noun or
demonstrative pronoun) can be verbalized and followed by a headless relative clause, as
in (365a–d). A COMP phrase headed by je can never be followed by a VIC however
(365e). We have no other account for this fact, except to speculate that, although je may
occur as the rightmost member of a verb compound (365f), it may not be verbalized in a
COMP phrase.

                 ‘his death’Examples like (704d) involve two levels of zero-derivation. First, tarama' ‘man’
undergoes zero-derivation to form a verb, ‘to (be a) man’ or ‘to grow’. Next, it and ca
undergo zero-derivation to form a noun, to which is attached the NIC, nexi' ‘possessive-
1pincl’. The question which arises with regard to these examples is the nature of the
constituent formed by the INFL+verb unit which undergoes zero-derivation. It does not
seem possible to merely analyse the INFL morpheme as a prefix on the verb for two
important reasons. First, this would leave us with no account for the fact that ca must
precede the verb in order to guarantee that tense be the second constituent in the clause.
Second, this would fail to account for the fact that in normal matrix and subclauses, the
gender information on the INFL morpheme does not agree with the subject or object per
se, but with the content of the COMP node.
    Consider the first problem, i.e. the requirement that tense always appear as the second
constituent of the clause. If tense/mood were a verbal affix, it would be the second
constituent of the clause whenever its ‘host’, the v, followed overt COMP. But it would
be the first constituent whenever the verb appeared in initial position, whether or not it
was prefixed or suffixed to the verb, since notions like first or second constituent cannot
‘look through layers’. That is, the restriction cannot be ‘second morphological or
syntactic constituent’, it must be one or the other. In fact, for 'ON, it must be ‘second
syntactic constituent’ because when question phrases appear in COMP (see 1.1.1.4.2
above on information questions), the INFL morpheme may not intervene between them,
meaning that tense must be the second phrasal constituent (we assume that VICS are
generated outside the verb phrase in agreement phrases, AGRPS). As for the fact that
INFL agrees in gender with the material in COMP, we claim that this is because the
INFL morpheme heads the phrasal projection in which COMP occurs at surface structure
(i.e. it winds up in co position and information questions and other COMP material are in
the SPEC (=specifier) position of the COMP phrase (CP)). However, we shall not argue
here for these more abstract structures. Suffice it to say that the VICS never agree directly
with material in COMP, so that if INFL were a verbal prefix, it would be a very strange
one in that its gender is controlled by sentence-initial position rather than by standard
grammatical relations, e.g. subject and object.
    But if INFL is not a verbal prefix, what is it? We will claim that it is the head of its
own Tense Phrase (TP) and that the verb adjoins to it. It is this INFL+v adjunction
                                         Wari'    358
structure which then undergoes zero-derivation to form a noun. The VICS, heading as
they do separate phrasal constituents under our analysis (AGRPS) can be omitted from
the scope of the nominalization rule. For readers who have an aversion to such
terminology, the bottom line is that we must allow INFL+v to form a constituent which
excludes the VICS but which does not merely analyse INFL as a prefix on the verb.
    To head off a potential counteranalysis: we consider the forms in (704) above to be
derived from verbs plus INFL, rather than from subordinate clauses, because they do not
contain VICS or NP arguments. A possible objection to analysing these as derived nouns
(rather than phrases) might be raised on phonological grounds. In (705) below, the word-
initial glottal immediately following the INFL morpheme fails to delete. However, in the
formation of kinship terms, which are clearly used as individual nouns (see 2.2.2.2.1.5),
the glottal stop does delete in this same environment. However, we believe that kinship
terms are idiomatic, crystallized forms that have been reanalysed as single words, and
that they do not represent a productive word-formation process. Thus, they do not
prejudice our claims here.

determines which form of the third person NIC can be used; masculine NICS cannot be
used with words referring to women, and vice versa.

These derived nouns can themselves be verbalized by zero-derivation and then be
renominalized, as below, where they have been verbalized, some even compounded, then
have, along with their containing structure, undergone wa ‘infinitive’ nominalization

marker wa, not all such verbs can function in derived
   nouns with possession marking NICS. For instance, if the relationship between the
noun and its possessor is purely possessive, the regular possessed noun must be used:
xirinain mapac (house-3n corn) ‘corn house’, not *ca xuru nein mapac (INFL:nrp/p
house-1s poss:3n corn); tapa' napa' wina me (burst 3s:rp/p-1s head-1s emph) ‘my head is
hurting me’, not *tapa' napa' ca wina ne me (burst 3s:rp/p-1s INFL:nrp/p head-1s poss:1s
emph). On the other hand, if the derived verb is expressing an event or process ((708)–
(711)), or if the relationship between the noun and its possessor is descriptive ((712)–
(713)), it can be used in a possessed derived noun:

the noun is zero-derived from a verb, mam toc ‘drink with’. In (718b), it is zero-derived
from the verb+VIC. (718c) shows that these cannot co-occur.

                              ‘my drinking thing’Only Tenseless VICS may occur within the scope of zero-derivation. The prohibition,
illustrated in (718c), against adding NICS to a zero-derived nominal including a VIC can
be explained if we assume that the features of the VIC are still visible/syntactically
relevant after the zero-derivation process and that something like Marantz’s (1984)
prohibition against vacuous affixation (or Chomsky’s (1993) ‘economy’ principle) is in
effect. To sum up, then, zero-affixation may derive a noun from a verb+VIC, excluding
INFL, but (i) VICS must be Tenseless; and (ii) no NIC may be added.
    2.2.2.2.1.3. Zero-derivation of clauses with NP arguments We have a few examples
of nouns derived from clauses, in which the NP constituents of the clause are present
(object and/or subject). However, these differ from simple subordinate clause structures
in that the verb is usually iterated and there is no VIC.

2.2.2.2.1.4. Zero-derivation of wa ‘infinitive’ clauses To derive a nonpossessed noun, a
wa infinitival clause may undergo zero-derivation:
(720) a.                            mam                                 toc                         wa

                    ‘marriage’ (for a woman)Example (720c) is interesting in that it shows an overt NP, tarama' ‘man’, within the
scope of zero-derivation. Recall from section 1.1.2.2.6.3 that wa has a passivization effect
in that it may not co-occur with an agent/actor NP but only with a theme NP. Another
example is:
(720) d.       ca                                      xin                          wa            pic
               INFL:nrp/p                              throw:s                      inf           rubber
               ‘playing ball’ (lit. ‘a ball being played with’)Some of these might merely be analysed as infinitive clauses, but since they may also
function as nouns, we include them here as a potential example of zero-derivation.
(721) a.        Hohot             na                       ca                             mixein                 wa.

                ‘Lying is okay.’

                ‘I do not want to go.’We have two examples of derived nouns, in which the verb is iterated and the infinitival
marker wa is used. The example in (722a) is the name of a river in the region, well
known for its abundance of game birds. The base form in (722b) is a verb derived from a
-xi' noun. As a verb, it means ‘to be fleshy’. See 2.2.2.1, where we describe these
‘derived verbs’.

nouns from clauses containing both INFL and VICS. These seem to be opaque to native
speakers (i.e. they do not think of their individual parts); they undergo phonological
processes other zero-derived nouns fail to undergo; and the process no longer seems
productive, since only kinship terms are so derived. Co- kinship terms are formed in the
following way: the INFL morpheme co precedes the first person singular form of the
kinship term and a Tenseless active VIC follows it.
(723) a.              cowere' ‘our (incl) older sister’
(723) b.              co                                  we                            'iri'

our analysis, wherein we has first been verbalized via zero-derivation and then combined
with co and 'iri' to form a noun zero-derived from a clause (with a literal translation like
‘we older sister’). Examples (724a–d) illustrate co- kinship terms with the first person
plural inclusive Tenseless VIC, expressing the notion of possessive and occurring as a
suffix (stress falls on the last syllable of the VIC). Examples (724e–g) illustrate co-
kinship terms with second and third person Tenseless VICS expressing possessive and
occurring as a separate clitic (stress falls on the base form).

(725a), possessors (725b) and demonstratives (725c)); and (2) they also function
semantically as nouns. The Tenseless VICS that occur with co- kinship terms express the
notion of possessive.

as follows: te ‘my father or paternal uncle’; 'aji' ‘my older brother or maternal uncle’; we
‘my older sister or paternal aunt’; xa' ‘my younger sibling’; pa' ‘my maternal
grandmother’; jeo' ‘my paternal grandparent or maternal grandfather’; nowin ‘my sister’s
                                        Morphology        367
daughter (male ego)’; and nem ‘my brother-in-law (sister’s husband)’. The remaining
kinship terms take the form of -xi' nouns. There is one additional kinship term that neither
uses co-, nor could be described as a relative clause. It refers to the child of a man:
panxita' (child-1s) ‘my child’, panxima (child-2s) ‘your (s) child’, etc.
    Kinship term constituents form a tighter phonological unit than other nouns derived
from co. This can be seen in certain phonological changes which take place in the derived
form, in particular, asyllabification and glottal deletion. For example, when co precedes
'aji' ‘my older brother’, as in cwaji' ca ‘his older brother’, the word-initial glottal plosive
on 'aji'          is dropped, and co becomes a labialized dorso-velar plosive. This
phonological change does not occur anywhere else when co precedes a word beginning
with a glottal-vowel sequence, as shown in (726b).

                ‘Who is crying?’The first person plural VICS also show a more intimate phonological connection to the
derived kinship term than in nominalized sentences: (1) the word-initial glottal on 'iri'
‘1pincl’ and 'urut ‘1pexcl’, as well as word-final glottals where applicable, are dropped;
(2) vocalic harmony occurs between the root and suffix; and (3) primary stress is
transferred from the basic form of the kinship term to the last syllable of the VIC.

"                          0.1.2. Syllable structure and prosody
'ON has cv and cvc syllables, the coda position of the latter being restricted in the number
of consonants which may appear in it. Only /n/ may appear in the coda of cvc in word-
medial position and only four other consonants, i.e. in addition to /n/, may appear in this
position word-finally. This produces (15×6×6 =) 540 total possible syllables for all
positions of the word, much greater than many Amazonian languages (e.g. Madi
(Arawan) with 47–50 possible syllables across dialects and Pirahã (Mura) with 108
possible syllables).
   Primary sentence stress appears on the final syllable of the verb (or penultimate
syllable if the final syllable is a stress-avoiding verb). There are some interesting vowel
harmony processes and stress interactions in the language but, by and large, the
phonology is relatively simple formally. In spite of all our work on segmental
phonological analysis, however, there are still numerous aspects that we do not yet fully
understand. We as yet have no account, for example, as to why /kw/ and /hw/ cannot be
followed by rounded vowels. In the light of the fact that k/h+o/u/ov sequences can
sometimes be realized as kwv/hwv, we are tempted to analyse [kw] and [hw] as allophones
of /k/ and /h/, respectively. Still, though, there are minimal pairs which we would then be
unable to explain. Moreover, there are many cases of [kw] and [hw] which would violate
                                          Wari'   2
canonical syllable structures of 'ON if analysed as k/h+rounded vowel. Therefore, we
have treated them here as separate consonant phonemes.","[14, 15]"

Stress falls on the last syllable of the word, except when that syllable is a stress-avoiding
member of a verbal compound, in which case stress will go on the syllable to its
immediate left.

There is only one basic intonation pattern in the language: rising pitch through the verb,
reaching high on the last syllable of the verb, and falling sharply on the next syllable
or postverbal modifier that does not carry stress); it then holds through any optional
arguments until the end of the sentence, or until a demonstrative or sentence-final
particle, in which case it rises on the last syllable of the argument preceding the
demonstrative or particle and falls sharply on the demonstrative or particle. In normal
speech, the second high pitch is lower than the first high pitch. Interrogative and
declarative intonation patterns are basically the same, differing only in the fact that the
peaks of intonation are higher in interrogatives than in declaratives (816d–f).

In contrast to normal speech, where the higher pitch of intonation falls on the verb, the
higher pitch of intonation is transferred to the emphasized constituent when a constituent
other than the verb is emphasized.

                       1.11.2.3. Movement of emphasized elements
Where movement is involved (see 1.11.2.1.3), nothing is left behind when the
emphasized element is the object of the verb (not even a VIC reference); the subject is
anaphorically marked in the VIC. Passivization of the construction prior to left
dislocation can only be done by wa ‘infinitive’, as in (370), not the normal passive VIC.
The only elements which can be left dislocated are those which could be referenced on
the VIC, as per our discussion in 1.2.1.2.3. However, only subjects can be referenced in
the VIC after left dislocation; objects may never be.

The focus of neutral yes-no questions is marked by increased loudness and higher pitch
on the stressed syllable of the element in focus (see 1.11.2.1.1). The focus of leading yes-
no questions is marked by the use of second person realis future VICS (see 1.1.1.2.1.2),
where a positive question expects a negative answer, and vice versa. Only the subject can
be focused in this manner. So in (373a), for example, ron indicates that the focus is on
Xijam, and in (373b), ram indicates that the focus is on third person singular feminine.

the main thematic line of a discourse.
   The majority of sentences express only the grammatical relations of subject, object,
indirect object or oblique object, but these individual grammatical relations may be
topicalized by a small range of strategies. These devices are used to indicate topic and the
main event line of the text.

Anaphora can also be expressed by the use of demonstrative pronouns. Demonstrative
pronouns only occur in the third person; thus this type of anaphora only occurs with third
person referents. See 2.1.2.2 for the complete list of demonstrative pronouns.
Demonstrative pronouns appear as anaphora in two ways.
   (1) In narrative discourse, the identity of the main characters is introduced by their
name or an NP, being referred to thereafter by the VICS, forms of the preposition, and
suffixes on possessed nouns. When the identity of the main characters is well known to
the interlocutors, they are often referred to via demonstrative pronouns, rather than
nonpronominal NPS. Demonstrative pronouns can also be used to indicate change of

(2) The more common anaphoric use of demonstrative pronouns is as ‘vocal pause’ when
‘stumbling’ in speech, similar to ‘uh’ in English. The example in (318) was taken from
text. The demonstrative pronouns are italicized.

                                  1.5.1.4. Reflexive pronoun anaphora
There are no formal reflexive pronouns, but there are reflexive VICS (see 1.6), the third
person (NP) antecedents of which can be deleted, just like antecedents of other VICS.

                                  1.5.1.5. Special anaphoric pronouns
Neuter demonstratives can be used anaphorically. There is some question as to whether
the demonstrative in (320) is simply a demonstrative or actually a demonstrative
pronoun. It is very possible that it is the latter, the specific gender marker 'i, which would
make it such, being dropped in rapid speech.

                          1.5.1.6. Anaphoric function of referent particle quem
The main function of the particle quem, which is frequently used, seems to be anaphoric
to something already mentioned or implied in the discourse. It can, however, also be
given the gloss of ‘also’. Native speakers frequently translate it as ‘also’ when they speak
Portuguese, using the Portuguese word também ‘also’ when they would use quem in 'ON.
The result is an overuse of the word também in Portuguese. (321d) illustrates how some
native speakers would translate (321a).

examples in (325) are taken from text. The clauses in (325a) occur as juxtaposed
sentences; the antecedent of pain ‘third person neuter preposition’ (in the third sentence)
is mijac ‘pig’ (in the first). In (325b), the first sentence precedes the second by eight
sentences; the antecedent of the third person neuter suffix of cwerein ‘its body’ (in the
second clause) is mijac ‘pig’ in the first.

                         2.2.2.2.2. Zero-derivation of nouns from verbs
A few nouns are derived from verbs simply by zero-derivation. This process is not
productive, but it is semantically regular. We have the following examples: horon ‘old
person’ is the plural, intense form of the verb hwara' ‘to be big’; mo'o ‘bearer of death
news’, when used as a verb, means ‘to notify of a death and bring back the mourners’;
mowa ‘poison vine’ means ‘to kill fish’ by crushing the poison vine and squeezing the
juices into a dammed up area of the river; and wac, used by most sub-groups to signify
‘knife’, while meaning ‘to cut’ as a verb. In addition, many nouns (names of animals,
birds, fish and objects) could be said to be derived from verbs, since they are
onomatopoeic terms (direct speeches), which are handled as verbs in the language. See
4.1 for examples.

                          2.2.2.3. Zero-derivation of operator words
Operator words, which mark moods or movement in the sentence and occur in COMP,
are zero-derived from various word classes: demonstrative, pronoun, preposition and
verb. They are semantically regular in that their meanings are fairly transparent and their
origins are clear:
ma'   signals interrogation (from ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’)
'om   signals negation (from 'om ‘to not exist’)
je    signals affirmation (from je ‘third person neuter emphatic pronoun’)
'ac   signals indication of resemblance (from 'ac ‘to be like’)
mo    signals condition (possibly from mo ‘list presentation’)
'ane signals contraexpectation (from 'ane ‘to be different’)
pain signals subordination and (?) distant past (from pain ‘third person neuter preposition’)ma' has three alternate forms that are derived by means of the third person singular object
suffix verbal inflectional morphemes: -on ‘masculine’, -m ‘feminine’, and -in ‘neuter’.
Mon, mam and main also signal interrogation.
   cain' signals interrogation. It is derived from cain ‘that neuter distal’. If we are correct
in our analysis of this form, as deriving from cain, the glottal is added, meaning that this
is not simply zero-derivation. See 2.2.6, where we describe verbs derived from nominals
by this same process.
   See 1.1.1.4.2, where we discuss operator words and their function in COMP sentences.","[381, 382]"
"This is not the only way xi' can combine with 'ara (or its singular form 'a), however. In
the previous examples, xi' immediately followed 'ara. In the following examples, a VIC
may intervene between 'ara and xi', to produce a causal reading as well. The principal
difference in distribution between these clauses and the type illustrated in (137) above is
that these latter clauses occur independently of an expressed superordinate clause. This
type of cause clause may also involve the co-occurrence of xi' and the postverbal
modifier 'awin ‘negative’. This type of construction is often ended with the particle 'ira
‘past progressive’.

    Irrealis verbal modification clauses must be introduced by the INFL morpheme xi
‘irrealis’. There is no distinction between cause, condition, and grounds/conclusion
clauses when they take the form of simple irrealis verbal modification clauses—see
1.1.2.4.2.5(2) and 1.1.2.4.2.9. They may be interpreted as either ‘because’, ‘if, or ‘or’,
depending upon the context. When they mean ‘because’, the affirmative surface meaning
is interpreted as negative, and vice versa. Irrealis verbal modification clauses often end
with the emphatic particle ta. The irrealis verbal modification clause follows the clause it
modifies and may be separated from it. In fact, it is very often used with its modified
clause left unexpressed. Though unexpressed, the modified clause is clear from context.

   There are three ways in which the verb 'om ‘not exist’ can be negated or otherwise
modified to render a causal reading. Two of these ways render a positive reading and one
way renders a negative reading.
   (i) The most common way of deriving the relevant causal reading from an 'om clause
is via the irrealis INFL xi, as described in the preceding section (illustrated in examples
(139)). 'Om ‘not exist’ is the main verb and, since the ‘subject’ of this clause is a noun
clause and its gender is neuter, only the Tenseless third person neuter VIC ne may
accompany the verb. These clauses must follow the clause they modify semantically. We
see little evidence of a syntactic or phonological link between these 'om clauses and the
clauses they modify however. The relationship seems mainly semantic. It is interesting to
compare examples (140a–b) and (140c–d): (140a) and (140c) are taken from the text
gathered fifteen to twenty years ago; these same sentences are now expressed by young
native speakers as (140b) and (140d), with the postverbal modifier 'ara ‘negative plural’
accompanying the verb. The presence of 'ara makes no difference in the meaning of the
cause construction.

‘He should go there, because his brothers and sisters are there.’(ii) The other type of 'om ‘because’ clause that renders a positive meaning is a simple
sentence which follows the sentence it modifies. Like the xi 'om ne clause, this second,
positive 'om clause seems to combine paratactically with its preceding clause in that it is
interpreted as a single semantic unit with the preceding clause, but is phonologically and
syntactically separate. This type of 'om clause is a simple sentence whose subject is a
noun clause, in which the postverbal modifier 'a ‘negative’ following the verb 'om ‘not
exist’ requires the use of a Tenseless VIC—see the discussion in 1.1.1.4.1. The only
possible syntactic link we can see between the two clauses is that 'om 'a ne clauses can
follow only superordinate clauses that manifest the realis past/present tense/mood. The
only examples of 'om 'a ne that we have in our corpus are in text gathered many years
ago. It is used rarely nowadays.

‘He should go there, because his brothers and sisters are there.’Some 'om clauses produce a negative meaning even when 'om forms a double negative,
unlike the cases of double negatives mentioned in 1.1.1.4.1(1) and 1.4.3. These are
marked by the use of the particle xi' ‘dubitative’ used elsewhere in cause clauses—see
1.1.2.4.2.4(1). This type of cause clause, shown in (142a), is rare. Cause with a negative
meaning is usually expressed by a simple negative statement, as in (142b).

   Contraexpective clauses are interpreted as ‘because’ or ‘but’, depending on the
context. When they occur independently, without overtly modify-ing another clause, they
usually have a reading of ‘because’. See 1.1.2.4.2.8 for the structure and uses of
contraexpective clauses.
   (5) Pain subordinate clauses functioning as cause clauses
   This type of cause clause is identical to its corresponding time and manner clause. The
clause follows the superordinate clause and cannot be separated from it—see examples
(129) and (132). The pain subordinate clause expressing cause is often accompanied by
the verb mi' ‘give’ in postverbal modifier position in its superordinate clause. Mi' also
occurs in postverbal modifier position in certain interrogatives to render a meaning of
‘why?’

means of mo COMP clauses, and by means of irrealis modification clauses.
   (1) COMP clauses with the operator word mo ‘conditional’ functioning as condition
clauses
   The most common way to express condition is by a COMP sentence marked by the
use of the word mo ‘conditional’ appearing in COMP. Two different INFL morphemes
can appear in condition clauses: ta ‘realis future’ or xi ‘irrealis’. The mo condition clause
precedes the clause it modifies, although each receives separate intonation and they are
separated by a pause. They do seem syntactically related however, in that there must be
agreement in tense/mood between the modifying and modified clauses, i.e. modified
clauses manifesting either realis past/ present or realis future tense/mood may follow
modifying clauses manifesting realis future, but if the modifying clause manifests irrealis
tense/ mood, the modifying clause must also manifest irrealis; see (145d) where this is
violated. BK has heard one 'Oro Nao' speaker use the operator word ma' instead of mo in
mo condition clauses. She believes this is due to the influence of that speaker’s wife, who
belongs to another subgroup.

predicate of the verbalized sentence described in 1.1.1.4.3.3.1. The dubitative particle xi'
(with perhaps a gloss of ‘negative’ here; see 1.1.2.4.2.1(2)) attaches to the embedded
clause as a postverbal modifier, and the realis past/present VIC na appears in the matrix
clause. The whole sentence is understood as modifying an unexpressed clause which is
understood in the context.

   (2) Irrealis verbal modification clauses functioning as condition clauses
   See 1.1.2.4.2.4(2) for the description of irrealis verbal modification clauses used as
cause clauses. When used as condition clauses, irrealis verbal modification clauses
maintain their basic reading, in contrast to their use in cause clauses, where their
affirmative form is interpreted as negative, and vice versa. Irrealis verbal modification
clauses follow their superordinate clauses. There is usually no pause or falling intonation
between the clauses.

verbal modification clause often ends with the emphatic particle ta.

           ‘That is why God only spoke his words. If God had have written them,
           write, write, he would have handed them down to us and (said), “This is
           my writing.” No (it wasn’t like that). If his body existed…isn’t that right?
           If his body existed… If it existed that he were able to write on paper
           also,…isn’t that right? If his feet existed where he (could) walk on the

           spirit (God) is not (like that). Because he is a true spirit (God). The body
           of the true spirit (God) does not exist.’1.1.2.4.2.6. Result The notion of reason/result is often manifested by a COMP sentence
in which je ‘third person neuter emphatic pronoun’ appears in COMP, and ca ‘neuter
realis past/present’, 'iri' ‘realis past/ present’, ta ‘realis future’, or xi ‘irrealis’ appears in
INFL. The postverbal modifier qui' ‘coming this way’ often follows the verb when ta or
xi occur in INFL. Je clauses are fully independent clauses. They often mark the beginning
of paragraphs, in which capacity they function as a kind of link or transition from one
theme to another, as though what follows is a result of what precedes. Note the meaning
of (152c), where either reason/result could be understood or interrogative ‘why?’—see
1.1.1.4.2(9), where we discuss the use of irrealis reason/result clauses to express the
interrogative ‘why?’ and ‘why not?’

           ‘So (for this reason) you should have talked to me.’ or ‘Why didn’t you talk to me?’Je clauses may, however, also follow statements and seem to function in direct
(semantic) subordination to them (153a). This is especially true of je clauses manifesting
irrealis (153b). They often work closely with mo xi condition clauses, with reason
expressed in the mo xi clause and result in a clause begun by je xi.

‘If they cooked right, we would eat it all up.’The notion of result can also be expressed by use of the preverbal modifier para
‘therefore’. Para explicitly expresses results in (154a), where it occurs in a statement like
(153a). It may also occur in a simple sentence as described in the paragraph following
                                                        Syntax     105
examples (57), where para requires the use of Tenseless VICS following the verb. When
expressing the notion of result, such a para sentence must follow a contraexpective
verbal modification clause (154b).

              ‘But Cowo' helped (existed to) me, (so) that’s why I arrived.’1.1.2.4.2.7. Comparative and equative The notions of comparative and equative are
expressed two ways:
   (1) By the verb win ‘like’ or ‘same’
   It may appear as an equative verb in a simple sentence (155a), where it must be
accompanied by Tenseless VICS (see 1.1.1.4.1(4) and the discussion in 1.1.1.4.1,
following the examples in (57) and (61)). It may also appear in COMP in a construction
similar to the 'om cause clause described in 1.1.2.4.2.4(3), preceding the examples in
(141), in which win appears as a verb and the third person neuter Tenseless VIC ne
follows it, referencing a noun clause subject introduced by ca ‘neuter realis past/present’
INFL morpheme (155b). Win may also appear as the leftmost member of a compound
verb to express the notion of equative (155c).

‘There is no one who is strong like he is.’ (lit. ‘…who is his same strong.’)(2) By the verb 'ac ‘like’
   'Ac, compounded with a denominalized verb appearing in a simple sentence, expresses
equative:
(156)                        'Ac                     pana                         na.

                             ‘It is like a tree.’Any other use of 'ac as a comparative/equative, i.e. when followed by a verb, requires its
use in a COMP comparison sentence, in which case 'ac appears as the operator word in
COMP, and the entire COMP sentence must be embedded as the derived predicate in a
verbalized comparative sentence—see 1.1.1.4.3.3.6. Note the absence of the INFL
morpheme ca and reduplication of the verb in the example in (157b). This is typical of
what can happen to nominal modification clauses—see again the discussion in 1.1.2.3.1
(see also 2.2.4.1.2, where we discuss the deletion of INFL when the verb is reduplicated).
(157) a.              'Ac           ca                             mao         cama                 na.

                      ‘It seems she went.’
(157) b.     'Ac       querec        querec         cama     we                         napa'              Hatem

             ma'.
             that:prox:hearer
             ‘Hatem looks to me like my older sister.’1.1.2.4.2.8. Contraexpective The notion of contraexpective is expressed by the COMP
clause in which 'ane ‘different’ appears in COMP. The use of the recent past sentence-
final particle, ne, is obligatory. When a noun occurs in the verb position of the sentence,
                                                      Syntax       107
the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/present’ precedes it; when a verb occurs in the
verb position of the sentence, no INFL morpheme follows COMP. When a
contraexpective clause is not immediately preceded by a clause setting up the
expectation, as in (158a), it is usually interpreted as ‘because’; when it is preceded by a
clause setting up the expectation, as in (158c–d), it is interpreted as ‘but’. The clause
preceding contraexpective clauses often manifests the verb paxi' ‘to not find’ in the
postverbal modifier position. Note (158d), where the contraexpective clause is both
preceded and followed by clauses to which it is related.

the postverbal position in a simple sentence, which precedes the clause setting up the
expectation. A pause and falling intonation separate the two clauses.

Verbal modification clauses can also be made nonfinite by replacing the VIC with the
infinitival/participial marker, wa. When wa is used, only the object of a transitive verb
can be overtly expressed; no subject can be expressed. Compare the sets of examples

There are sequence of time requirements between v i…ne time clauses and irrealis verbal
modification clauses used as condition clauses and their respective superordinate clauses.
The use of irrealis in a subordinate clause usually requires agreement in the superordinate
clause, but see (139), where the irrealis tense/mood of the irrealis verbal modification
clause used as a cause clause does not agree with the realis future tense/ mood in the
superordinate clause.","[107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124]"
"People do not interpret expressions like 'Oro Nao' as ‘all the bats’, but as proper names.
So we will analyse these as in (743):
(743)                   [N [Np 'Oro Nao'] ] N(Aside from the interpretation of such terms as proper names, we have no other evidence
that these are in fact zero-derived nouns instead of NPS.) The only other potential cases
of nominal compounding are the reduplicated cases in 2.2.4.2 as compounds. See that
section for discussion.",[390]
"                             2.2.4.1.1. Plural/intensive reduplication
Most plural, intense forms of verbs are derived from their singular forms by means of
partial reduplication. This is accomplished either by simply reduplicating the cv of the
stressed syllable once or twice (this process usually takes place with transitive verbs), or
by reduplicating the cv of the stressed syllable with a cvrv pattern (this process usually
takes place with intransitive verbs). There are also many singular and plural pairs of
verbs formed by suppletion. Approximately one third are formed by suppletion, one third
by simply reduplicating the cv of the stressed syllable, and one third by reduplicating
with the cvrv pattern. Note (744e), where the plural, intense form is the base form for a
form of yet greater intensity.

INFL morphemes are often omitted when the verb is reduplicated. This could be either a
morphological fact, that INFL and reduplication are in complementary distribution, but it
seems more likely to have a semantic account, namely that with progressive aspect
marked in reduplication, INFL is unnecessary. INFL is absent in each of the verb-
reduplicated clauses below, where it would have otherwise been expected.

transitive verb, the derived form refers to its object (748a–b); when it is an intransitive

verb, it refers to its subject (748c–d). The example in (748b) could possibly be derived
from the onomatopoeic formative 'ein, the sound this particular frog species makes.

A few cases of verbs derived from nominals (and one derived from a demonstrative)
involve the addition of a glottal (or globalized nasal as in (749a)) to the end of the noun
to derive the verb. No other phonological changes are observed.

                        ‘They abandoned us.’In (750) the verb cawain' ‘to dry’ seems to be derived from the -xi' noun cawaxi' ‘dry
season’. Although we have no record of cawaxi' occurring in an inflected form, cawain
would be its third person neuter inflection.

                           ‘To'o pinched me.’In (752), the operator word cain' ‘interrogation’ seems to be derived from the
demonstrative cain ‘that neuter distal’:

                                   ‘that neuter distal’

           ‘When will you come?’ (lit. ‘When do you (say), ‘We will come”?’)
                     2.2.6. Derivation from verbal inflectional clitics
There are two kinship terms and one verb which might have been derived from verbal
inflectional clitics, although this is still a bit speculative. It seems that the noun na' ‘my
mother’ could be derived from the third person realis past/present VIC na; the noun nem
‘my brother-in-law’ could be derived from the realis past/present VIC na ‘third person
singular’ with the second person singular object, nem ‘third person singular to second
person singular’ respectively; and the verb nam'/nanam' ‘to be pregnant’ could be derived
from the third person singular and/or plural VICS, na and nana, with third person
singular and/or plural objects, -m and vcvm. In the case of na' and nam'/nanam', it could
be said that they are derived by the addition of a glottal, as discussed in 2.2.5. In the case
of nem, it could be said that it is derived via zero-derivation.
    Not only are these terms identical to their basic forms, but the first person plural forms
of na' ‘my mother’, xi' ‘our (inclusive) mother’ and xut ‘our (exclusive) mother’, are
exactly identical to the forms of the first person plural realis future VICS. On the other
hand, this similarity breaks down in the second and third person inflections of na' ‘my
mother’, where the kinship term follows the pattern of regular -xi' nouns: jim ‘your (s)
mother’, jicon ‘his mother’, jicam ‘her mother’, jinain ‘its mother’, juhu' ‘your (p)
mother’, jicocon ‘their (m) mother’, and jicacam ‘their (f) mother’. Nem ‘my brother-in-
law’ inflects for possession like co- kinship terms: conem ma ‘your (s) brother-in-law’,
conem ca ‘his brother-in-law’, etc.
    The literal meanings of the VICS would lead culturally and etymologically quite
naturally to the kinship terms, since these derived forms reflect two of the most important
aspects of the basic social structure of this matriarchal society: that of mother and sister.
‘Mother’ might reasonably be thought of simply as one who is, who exists: ego needs no
special term (noun or verb) to refer to her; she just is, hence the simple use of the third
person singular realis past/present VIC, na ‘he or she (is)’. In like manner, male ego’s
sister is his most honoured and important kin, and he needs no special term to refer to her
                                       Morphology          383
husband. He simply uses the third person singular to second person singular VIC, nem
‘he to you (s)’. As for the verb nam'/nanam' ‘to be pregnant’, the origins (‘he to her’ and
‘them to them feminine’) are also clear.

                  ‘bee species’Many words, especially monosyllabic words, begin with a glottal plosiveconsonant
sequence, involving plosives, affricates and nasals. In these words, the glottal plosive-
consonant sequence fluctuates with the single consonant of the respective sequences, and
we analyse the        sequence as an allophone variant of the relevant c. In addition, a
glottal plosive always precedes word-initial semivowels, even in polysyllabic words.
   There seems to be some correlation between words beginning with a glottal-consonant
sequence in the 'Oro Nao' dialect and words that, in other dialects ('Oro Waram, 'Oro
Mon, 'Oro Waram Xijein, 'Oro 'At) begin with         : com            ‘water’, te       ‘my

other dialects. This correlation, however, is not consistent throughout the language: jowin
             ‘monkey species’, waram                     ‘monkey species’, and pi
‘thorn’ are pronounced the same in all dialects.

   In some idiolects, especially of children, word-final glottal plosives, glottalized nasals,
and glottal-consonant sequences are not pronounced at all. Adults’ pronunciation is
variable. Adults and children always pronounce word-initial glottal plosives preceding
vowels at the beginning of a word and usually intervocalically within words (although
glottal stop is sometimes replaced by length on the preceding vowel or following
consonant). Adults are fairly consistent in pronouncing word final glottal plosives and
glottalized nasals.

Table 2.1 offers, at a glance, the different categories of verbal inflectional clitics that
mark agreement with the subject and direct object/indirect object/benefactive of verbs.
All VICS follow the verb. All the verbal inflectional clitics in Table 2.1 indicate person
and number. Some of them also indicate tense/mood, and others indicate third person
gender. In addition, number is indicated in verbs that have a singular and plural form. A
more complete discussion follows.
    2.1.3.6.1.1. Subject The person and number of the subject must be coded in the VIC.
In addition, tense/mood is coded in the Tense VICS, and third person gender is coded in
the Tenseless VICS (which usually co-occur with INFL). There are three sets of Tense
VICS: realis past/present, realis future, and irrealis; they occur in simple sentences. There
is a single set of Tenseless VICS which occurs in most COMP sentences. They must also
be used when a small class of verbal modifiers functions in simple sentences—see
                      Table 2.1 Categories of verbal inflectional clitics
              Tense                                               Tenseless               Object
Active        realis past/present realis future irrealis          simple uninflected      object
Non-active    passive 1                                           passive 2               reflexive/reciprocal
1.1.1.4.1 and 1.1.1.4.2. Passive 1 VICS (‘Tense’) are like Tense active VICS in not co-
occurring with INFL, but are unlike them in not expressing tense themselves. Passive 2
VICS (‘Tenseless’) function like Tenseless active VICS in co-occurring with INFL.
   Subject person is coded by the choice of the appropriate subject VIC. In addition,
subject humanness/nonhumanness is coded by the choice of singular vs plural subject
VICS: only humans can be marked by plural VICS; both singular and plural nonhumans
must be marked by singular VICS. Subject number is also coded by the correct choice of
the intransitive verb (see 2.2.3.1, where we discuss agreement of subject/object with
singular and plural verb forms). Both human and nonhuman plural subjects must be
marked by the plural form of intransitive verbs.

person gender of the object may be coded in the VIC. The single set of object morphemes
occurs as suffixes on subject morphemes, with this pair of affixes functioning together as
a postverbal clitic. The object morphemes agree with the person and number of all
objects, and gender of third person objects, whether overt or covert (see 2.1.2.3.1).

            ‘Hatem cooked the fish for To'o.’The same rules for coding person and number in the subject also apply to objects. In
addition to coding object number by the correct choice of the object affix, it can also be
coded by the correct choice of the form of the verb, if it is one of the transitive verbs that
has a singular and plural form. In contrast to intransitive verbs, where both human and
nonhuman plural subjects must be indicated, when possible, by the plural form of the
verb, transitive verbs do not always require the use of plural forms to indicate plural
objects. The plural form of transitive verbs can clarify the number of the object, but it
also describes the scope of the action. Less intense actions of a shorter duration tend to be
marked by singular forms, while more intense actions of a longer duration tend to be
marked by plural forms. The choice of the singular or plural form of the verb in these
situations depends on how the speaker views the situation; it is largely subjective.

(2) VICS fail to undergo word-internal phonological changes which ordinarily happen
when morphemes are suffixed to nouns. For example, in the derived noun copari’ ‘our
maternal grandmother’ (co-pa'-'iri' INFL:m/frp/ p-maternal:grandmother: 1s-1pincl) two
phonological changes take place when ‘iri’ is suffixed to pa': there is vocalic harmony
(a+i=a) and the glottal is deleted—see 3.2.6.4 for the complete discussion of vowel
harmony. By contrast, VICS that follow verbs do not undergo these phonological
changes.

VICS bears secondary stress, while the last syllable of verbs bears primary stress.

"                                 1.16.7. Verbal modifiers
Verbal modifiers are a subclass of verb roots. They can only appear in compound verbs.
They are divided into two classes: (1) preverbal, which are marked by their occurrence
preceding the main verb root; and (2) postverbal, which follow the main verb root
immediately before the VIC, modulo compounding (see 2.2.3).

                                 1.16.8. Inflectional clitics
There are two classes of inflectional clitics: (1) verbal inflectional clitics, or VICS, which
are marked for person, number and, in some cases, tense/ mood and third person gender
of subjects and objects—see 2.1.3.6.2.2; and (2) possessive nominal inflectional clitics,
or NICS, which mark person, number, and third person gender, appear in derived nouns
and may also follow unpossessed nouns—see 2.1.1.4.6.","[229, 230]"
"                 1.1.2.4.2. Marking of particular verbal modification clauses
1.1.2.4.2.1. Time There are five different ways to express time clauses:
    (1) v 'i…ne clauses
    The most common time clause is marked by the use of the postverbal modifier
'i:s/'iri:p ‘already’ immediately following the verb, and the occurrence of the recent
past/uncertainty particle ne at the end of the sentence. It should be noted that the
‘number’ of the verbal modifier does not necessarily refer to the number of the actors of
the verb; singular/ plural in verbal elements also refers to the intensity of the action. In
this case, 'iri ‘already:p’ describes an action that took place more recently than one
modified simply by 'i ‘already:s’. Tense/mood (realis past/ present (127a), realis future
(127b) and irrealis (127c)) is indicated by the choice of VIC accompanying the verb.
There is always agreement of tense/ mood between the subordinate and superordinate
clauses, v 'i…ne time clauses always precede the superordinate clause. They must be
followed by a superordinate clause, although the superordinate clause need not
necessarily immediately follow the subordinate clause. While pause and falling
intonation between the two clauses indicate that they are two separate sentences
phonologically, we take the restriction that both clauses agree in tense/mood to mean that
they are still syntactically related. Strings of v 'i…ne clauses can occur. The example in
(127d) shows two v 'i…ne time clauses separated from their superordinate clause by a
parenthetical clause to which they are not subordinate. The superordinate clause of a v
'i…ne time clause often takes the form of a sequential verbalized sentence (see
1.1.1.4.3.3.5).

            ‘When I pierce this ear, you pierce his other ear.’(2) xi' time clauses
    xi' time clauses are marked by the use of the particle xi' immediately preceding the
VIC, compounded as a postverbal modifier with the verb. We are not sure what xi'
means. We are going to gloss it here as ‘dubitative’, although we are still not certain that
it is in fact the same morpheme. It occurs elsewhere as a sentence-final particle,
expressing doubt or supposition; it may also appear as a postverbal modifier to express
negation; it interacts with negative postverbal modifiers to express a strong positive
causal meaning; it appears with certain nonsubordinate condition clauses; it can mean
‘certainly’ to express emphasis; and it seems to be able to express indefinite or
hypothetical time in xi' time clauses. It is not to be confused with the irrealis INFL
morpheme xi (note the absence of the glottal plosive), nor the first person inclusive realis
future VIC xi'. In xi' time clauses, only third person realis past/present VICS (na/nana)
may appear. Xi' time clauses precede their superordinate clauses and, like v 'i…ne time
clauses, pause and falling intonation indicate that they are independent phonologically.
There does not seem to be as much connection between xi' time clauses and their
superordinate clauses as is the case with v 'i…ne clauses, in that they are less likely to
occur with a superordinate clause. However, there does seem to be an apparent
morphosyntactic constraint holding between the VICS of the two clauses, namely, they
must both be in realis past/present. Note in example (128c) that a string of xi' clauses
precedes a series of main clauses that seem to be functioning as the clauses to which the
xi' clauses are subordinate. Note also that the second xi' clause is a sequential sentence
which generally functions as the superordinate clause of time clauses, as in the v ‘i…ne
discussed previously.
    It should be noted that, while we have found many examples of xi' time clauses in text,
native speakers declare that its use is bad grammar. We do not yet understand this
discrepancy between frequent use versus intuitions of unacceptability of xi' clauses by
native speakers. They say v 'i… ne constructions are the most correct way to express time
clauses. Xi' time clauses are italicized in the following examples:

‘Whenever a snake casts a spell on them, then whenever the shaman does them. “You killed a
snake regarding our child”, (he says). “No I didn’t kill it, it’s the bad heart of his mother”, thus they
(say) to him.’(3) Pain subordinate clauses used as time clauses
   Pain subordinate clauses express time, manner, and cause. The temporal reading (as
opposed to other readings of these sentences; see 1.1.2.4.2.2 and 1.1.2.4.2.4(5)) is
contextually determined. The preverbal modifier 'aram ‘finally:p’ is optionally used and
has the effect of clarifying that a particular pain clause expresses a temporal notion. A
pain subordinate clause usually follows its superordinate clause, and it cannot be
separated from it, except when topicalized. In this case only, it may precede its
superordinate clause. There is a slight pause between the clauses, but high intonation held
to the end of the time clause indicates that it cannot be completely separated from its
main clause. Thus pain initial clauses are much more like grammatically subordinate
clauses than those mentioned previously. Pain subordinate clauses, used as time clauses,
are italicized in the following examples:

There is no special nominal inflection marking for quality. The notion of quality (person
with or without a certain quality) can be expressed by the preverbal modifier tama'
‘always’ or the verb taxipa' ‘to befriend’ used in the postverbal modification position
with the meaning of ‘customarily’, appearing optionally with the main verb of the

There is no special nominal inflection marking for quantity. Terms of quantity are limited
in the language. They occur as verbs, as follows: xica' pe/to ‘to be alone’/‘to be one’,
tucu caracan ‘to be face-to-face’/‘to be two’, paric ‘to be few’, tocwan ‘to be several’,
mija ‘to be much’, 'iri' mijo ‘to be many’, and xam' ‘to be all of it’. Numerical terms for
‘two’ or more have been borrowed from Portuguese, and they are readily used by the
younger generation; older people, however, usually use only 'ON equivalents wherever
possible. The Portuguese term for ‘one’, um or uma is never used as a substitute for xica'
pe/to ‘to be alone’/‘to be one’.

There is no special nominal inflection for material. In the Wari' culture, products carry
the name of the material from which they are made, e.g. temem' ‘bow’ is made from the

hard palmwood which bears this name, wao' ‘small woven basket’ is made from the
leaves of the palm tree which bears this name. A statement such as ‘I made the bow with
temem' wood’ would be senseless, because a temem' can only be made with temem'

mats, large baskets, house coverings, canoes, etc. Material in relation to these objects can
be expressed by verbalizing the noun representing the product (i.e. using the first person
singular possessive form), using it as the last member of a compound verb, and
expressing the material as the object of this compound verb:

There is no special nominal inflection marking for manner. Manner is expressed in two
ways.
  (i) As a derived noun in a prepositional phrase

            ‘He came angrily.’ (lit. ‘…with anger.’)(ii) As part of a compound verb
    It may occur initially or noninitially in the compound, depending on the chronological
order of the actions and the underlying semantic features of the verbs.

"Persons identified by the same term can be contrasted by use of the following type of

                     ‘my elder brother by means of my mother’ (MB)Clarification is also sometimes made by use of the modifiers xucun ‘other of something
masculine’, xequem ‘other of something feminine’, and 'iri' ‘truly’ preceding the kinship
term (xucun te ‘my other father’, xequem na' ‘my other mother’, 'iri' xa' ‘my real
brother’). We believe, however, that these clarifications are more for the benefit of
outsiders. There is no need for this type of distinction within the Wari' society.

                                     5.1.1.3. Relationships by marriage
Distance relatives are marriageable. Reference is made to these persons as illustrated in
(849). Anyone with whom one is hwaramu (kinship term) ‘chin related’ (evidently
                                              Lexicon      433

              ‘He is my distant “father”.’ (lit. ‘I refer to him distantly as “my father”.’)Some of the kinship terms for relationships by marriage are generally used only when
there are no children present in the marriage. Once a child is born, compound terms in the
form of possessed NPS are used to describe the relationship of the kin in consideration
for the child or children of the marriage, for example, cote cacama humaju ‘my
children’s father’ instead of taxi ‘my husband’. The person marker of the NP varies
according to the sex and number of the child/children. In the following list, the citation
form is listed first, and where it differs, the term for marriages where children are present
is listed immediately under the citation form, with its gloss. Alternate forms assume that
two or more children of both sexes are present in the marriage.

listed immediately following it. Any other relationships by marriage, e.g. HBW, HZH,

members of a given subgroup, and often across subgroup boundaries, are related in some
way or another.

                                              5.1.3. Body parts
Most terms for body parts are -xi' nouns, occurring either alone or in possessed NPS with
other -xi' nouns. A few terms are nouns derived from verbs. In either case, they are
obligatorily possessed, with the first person plural inclusive inflection (marked by -xi' or
nexi') being the citation form. All terms for body parts belong to the neuter gender class
of nouns. Some xi' terms have an unpossessed alternate form which is enclosed in
parentheses in the following list:

Compounding is easily the most productive process for deriving subtypes of verbs. Here
we want to discuss the headedness of compounds, the causal-temporal-modificational
organizing principles of compounds, and offer arguments that cases we are analysing as
compounds cannot be analysed instead as incorporation of serial verbs. We should note at
the outset that we do not write compounds as single words, following instead the
practical orthography of the language, which separates each member of the compound.",[382]

There are no articles. Definiteness and indefiniteness can be expressed by the use of
object VICS (251a) or demonstratives (251d). This is not a hard and fast rule, however,
since indefinite objects can still be marked by object VICS.

                                 1.2.5.2.5. Demonstratives as modifiers
There are two classes of demonstratives: spatial and temporal. They rarely follow other
than the last noun of the clause. Spatial demonstratives can be divided into three classes.
Cwa' ‘this (m/f)’ and ca' ‘this (n)’ refer to someone or something proximate to the
speaker; ma' ‘that (any gender)’ refers to someone or something proximate to the hearer;
and cwain ‘that (m/f)’ and cain ‘that (n)’ refer to someone or something far away (distal)
from the interlocutors. There must be gender agreement where relevant between the noun
and its demonstrative.

referred to has been absent: paca' ‘that just occurred (always heard but never seen)’, cara
ne ‘that recently absent’, and cara pane ‘that long absent’. It is hard to say whether ne
and pane are actually part of the demonstrative. We have included them because they
always accompany cara when used as a demonstrative (cara also occurs as a postverbal
modifier, meaning ‘always’ or ‘forever’). Ne and pane are sentence-final temporal
particles (‘recent past’ and ‘remote past’ respectively). There are no gender distinctions
in temporal demonstratives.

                                         1.2.5.2.6. Quantifiers
There is a set of collective particles that can precede any nominal construction: 'oro,
mana, waram, 'oromon, and mon. They express the notion of plurality in a group. Their
use is determined by the class of noun with which they can be used. Note the glosses of
(254a), (256), (257) and (258) with the collective particles, where the notion of plurality
in a group means a specific group, not just ‘old people’ or ‘men’ in general.
   Mana can only precede some tree names and kinship terms using the Tenseless VICS:

                                    ‘the men’'Oro can precede all other nouns and nominal constructions. Although collective particles
express the notion of plurality in a group, 'oro often ranges over the individual members
of a group to express a kind of ‘generic plural’, and in this function can mean ‘any’.
Compare the use of mana in (254a) with the use of 'oro in (258b), where plurality of a
specific group is contrasted with ‘generic plural’. Note also the use of 'oro with other
nominal constructions in (258c–e).

"                                             1.1.1.2.1. Yes-no questions
Simple yes-no interrogative sentences are similar to simple declarative sentences (see
1.1.1.4.1.) in their basic structure: both use any of the three subtypes of Tense or reflexive
verbal inflectional clitics. Interrogative intonation, however, distinguishes yes-no
interrogatives from declarative sentences.

  The sentence-final particle quem is frequently used in yes-no questions. It refers to
something already mentioned or implied.

          ‘Did you kill fish?’1.1.1.2.1.1. Neutral questions Yes-no questions are understood to be neutral questions,
expecting either an affirmative or negative answer, unless marked by the special
‘rhetorical’ uses of VICS. See next section.
    1.1.1.2.1.2. Leading questions Yes-no questions are often expressed in the form of
leading questions using ra ‘2s:rf’, ron ‘2s:rf-3sm’, ram ‘2s:rf-3sf’, roron ‘2s:rf-3pm’,
raram ‘2s:rf-3pf’, or rain ‘2s:rf-3n’. In addition, yes-no questions may also be expressed
in the form of leading questions using xin (1pincl:rf-3n) in conjunction with the sentence-
final particles ne ‘rec. past’ and/or pane ‘rem:past’, with either declarative or
interrogative intonation. A final type of leading question uses na' nam ‘3s:rp/p 3s:rp/p-
3sf’ (addressing a mixed or feminine audience) and na' non ‘3s:rp/p 3s:rp/p-3sm’
(addressing a masculine audience).
    Ra (ron ‘2s:rf-3sm’, ram ‘2s:rf-3sf’, roron ‘2s:rf-3pm’, raram ‘2s:rf-3pf’, rain ‘2s:rf-
3n’) can be used in two different ways: (i) when used in an affirmative sentence with
interrogative intonation, it demands a negative answer; when used in a negative sentence
with interrogative intonation, it demands an affirmative answer; and (ii) when used with
declarative intonation, it demands agreement. We have italicized the leading question
particles and their glosses in the following examples.

action is in the third person, either ra or its variations are used. The gender of the noun to
which the object suffix on the VIC refers (either stated or implied) determines which will
be used. The ra form only occurs in the sentence-final position. When one of the

    Xin is the first person plural inclusive realis future VIC suffixed by the third person
neuter object VIC. It may also be used idiomatically as a leading question particle, which
reveals a measure of curiosity or amazement on the part of the speaker and expects an
affirmative answer. It is often accompanied by the temporal particles ne ‘recent past’ or
pane ‘remote past’, and more rarely the referent particle quem, or the emphatic particle
ta. Ne is the most common particle to occur with xin. It occurs sentence-finally and seems
to have the following functions in many environments: it modifies the verb in some
subordinate sentences (see time clauses—1.1.2.4.2.1; and contraexpective clauses—
1.1.2.4.2.8); it is a type of ‘attention-getter’, drawing attention to a spoken or unspoken
situation (i.e. ‘I’m expecting a response from you’); it expresses uncertainty; and as one
of a set of temporal particles, it means ‘recent/ immediate past’. When occurring with xin,
it seems to function as an ‘attention-getter’. No doubt its meaning of uncertainty or
recent/ immediate past also plays a role here, and since another temporal particle, pane
‘rem:past’ also appears with xin, we will gloss ne as a temporal particle in leading
questions.

                          ‘(That) was (so), wasn’t it?’Na' nam/na' non demands agreement from the hearer. When the response is voiced, it is
usually 'e'e' ‘yes’. Na' nam/na' non usually occurs after a declarative statement, but it can
also precede it. It can also stand quite free of any other statement, though usually in mid
discourse, so that it is loosely connected to either the preceding or following statement. In
narrative discourse, it often introduces a parenthetical explanation or diversion. Na' nam
is used when addressing a female or mixed audience; na' non is used when addressing a
strictly male audience. (The example in (12a) is a minor sentence type—see 1.15.)
