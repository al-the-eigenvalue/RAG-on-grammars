CoorDINATE NOUN PHRASES WITH me a lechub
25.4.1.   In 25.2.1 above we saw that the expression me a lechub ‘or’ can be

           used to connect two clauses. This expression can also join
           nouns (or noun phrases), resulting in a coordinate noun phrase of
           the form A me a lechub B‘A or B’. Observe the examples below:

                         the above expression     are used     primarily   in a religious                 11. Another verb in which / appears in the perfective forms is menga

            In normal conversation, the word babeluades is used for ‘heaven ‘                             12. This added syllable seems to be a kind of reduplication (see 11.11).

         is related to bedul ‘direction, area/space facing onto’. In the sentences                        only makes sense if er a kederang is interpreted as a locational phrase

            both of which we have translated as ‘went into’. While siliseb implies                       er a ‘when’, as in the following:

            The   verb   omeche   ‘leave’     is used   in the   very   common   expression            32. This expression, containing ‘krel (the possessed form of iikr ‘area/

             Fe It is possible that Amo has developed from a form of the verb dmu                                    A Droteo a uleker er ngak ¢l kmo ng soam a biang.

                   assimilation (cf. 1.3.3) of d to the preceding velar consonants k and                         of directly-quoted vs. indirectly-quoted questions. While a directly-

                {akkmu] and [pkmu]. The pronunciation of dmu as [kmu] has spread                                 an indirectly-quoted question (e.g., the example above) does not. A

     answer to A’s question:                                                        With non-human sentence objects, the presence or absence

                ‘There's pork, fish, and crab.’                                         ‘I need the boat tomorrow,’
             B: Ng soak el menga er a ngikel.                                       b. Ak ousbech a bilas er a klukuk.

     In B’s response, er a ngikel ‘the fish’ makes specific reference to
                                                                              (38) a.   Ak ousbech gr a mlim ¢l mo er a ocheraol.
     the fish which A has prepared on a particular occasion and which                   ‘I need your car to go to the money-raising party.’
     A   is offering to B as part of a choice of foods.
                                                                                   b. Ak ousbech a mlim ¢l mo er a ocheraol.
             In example 33a,                                                            ‘I need your cars to go to the money-raising party.”
     (33a) Ak ousbech a biskang el mo er a chei.                              When er precedes the non-human object noun, as in 37a and 38a
                ‘I use a spear to go fishing with.’
                                                                              above, it invariably refers to a specific singular object. If er is
     the object noun biskang ‘spear’ is not preceded by er and is there-      omitted, however, as in 37b and 38b, the sequence a plus following

     designate some specific spear but simply refers to the idea of           example, a bilas of 37b can refer to a non-specific singular object
50                                                              PALAUAN NOUNS                PALAUAN NOUNS                                                                  51     (‘a boat’) or to a specific plural object (‘the boats’). As we can see,                             When third person object nouns follow perfective verb forms,
     then, the presence or absence of er does not result in an absolutely                           they can never be preceded by the specifying word er. In other
     clear-cut distinction between singular and plural, since some                                  words, while 41a and 42a below are correct, 41b and 42b are not:
     object nouns which are not preceded by er (e.g. @ bilas of 37b) can

                                                                                                         b.   *A Toki a chillebedii er a ngalek.
          As we have seen above, non-human object nouns may or
     may not be preceded by the specifying word er, with a significant                              (42) a.   A derumk   a ulekerngii a bilis.      “The thunder woke up

                 ‘Don’t hit the child!’

                 ‘Droteo was hitting the children.’

     special pronoun ending which identifies the object, whereas
     imperfective verb forms do not. Compare the imperfective and
     perfective forms for a few Palauan verbs:

        appears in combination with something else—in this case, the                         which refers to the person addressed, and a third person pronoun

        to express a relationship of possession between the noun stem                        Ist pers.     -ek ‘my’       ngak ‘I’           -ed ‘our (incl.)’ kid ‘we (incl.)’

         inclusive and exclusive possessor suffixes. The first person plural                  You will notice that charm ‘animal’ has the full vowel a in its
         inclusive suffix -ed not only makes reference to the speaker but also                independent (or unpossessed) form, but shows the neutral vowel ¢
         includes reference to the person spoken to; in addition, any                         (schwa) in all of its possessed forms. In other words, the morpheme

         this is called the e set because all the singular suffixes (-ek, -em,                Notice, again, that although the unpossessed forms of the nouns

           reduction is actually vowel deletion, or complete loss of the vowel.

           Full vowels      following ng, /, or (less frequently)       r in the inde-
           pendent form of a noun are often deleted in the possessed forms,              3.4.2.       So far we have seen how the single vowels i, u, e, 0, and a observed
           where the stress is shifted to the possessor suffixes. In the possessed                    in the independent forms of nouns either reduce to ¢ or delete

      Even though it translates as English ‘always’, the word blechoel                           ‘Toki has just heard the news.’
      of 51 seems to be a verb because it is preceded by a subject (ak                      b.   Ak ko el mesubang.
      ‘T’) and followed by a specifying clause.!! This specifying clause                         ‘I’ve just gotten (a chance) to study.’
      (italicized) identifies the activity which the subject is always               In 56a—b, the specifying clause following ko ‘just’ contains an
      pursuing. Further evidence that blechoel is a verb—more specifi-               inchoative verb form (cf. 11.12.3).
      cally, a state yerb—is seen in the fact that it takes the auxiliary
      word mie in the past tense (cf. 5.1.3), as the following examples
      show:      (52) a.     Ak mle blgchoel gl mo er a che gl obengkel a demak.
                  ‘I always used to go fishing with my father.’
              b. A Droteo a mle blechoel ¢l meleng a udoud.
                  ‘Droteo always used to borrow money.’      Some further sentences containing blechoel are given below:      (53) a.     Ng blechoel ¢l ngmasech a rengum.
                  “You're always getting angry.’
             b.   A Droteo mg a Toki a blechoel ¢! kaungeroel.

                  ‘John never studies,’             In the examples below, we illustrate the use of several other
      unusual verbs which resemble b/echoel ‘always’:

        animal, or thing affected by the action in question—appears as                         and second, the verb of the dependent clause can be in the present

         the dependent clauses of 2b and 3b as object clauses. An object                                      “We'll begin (to build) the house tomorrow.’
         clause is therefore a subtype of dependent clause which is used                                b.    Ke mo omuchel er a urerem er oingarang?
         in “object     position”     immediately   following    certain   transitive                         “When are you going to begin your work?’
         verbs like mo merek         ‘finish, stop’ and mesuub    ‘study, learn’. If           When omuchel is used as a transitive verb, as in the examples of
         we compare     the a- and    b-sentences of 2-3 above, we can see that
                                                                                               5 and 6 above, its subject must always be animate (or living)—
         an object clause designating an action or activity can substitute                     usually a human being. It is also possible for omuchel to be used as
         for or replace a “simple” noun phrase object denoting something                       an intransitive verb, in which case its subject will be inanimate
         concrete.                                                                             (or non-living). The intransitive use of omuchel is observed in the
              One further grammatical characteristic of object clauses                         sentences below:
         should be mentioned here. As we saw in chap. 15, many Palauan
         speakers can use past tense verb forms in purpose clauses, instru-                    (7) a.        A meeting a mo omuchel er a euid ¢l klok.
                                                                                                             ‘The meeting will begin at seven o’clock.’
         ment clauses, and the like. By contrast, object clauses cannot
         contain past tense verb forms under any circumstances. Therefore,                              b.   A kerrekeriil er a Droteo a ulemuchel er a elii.
                                                                                                             *Droteo’s trial began yesterday.’
         a sentence like the following is impossible (cf. 2b):
                                                                                               Since omuchel is an intransitive verb in the sentences of 7, these

OBJECT   CLAUSES        FOLLOWING            omuchel AND    mo merek                           ‘finish, stop’ consists of the directional verb mo ‘go’ and merek,

         most commonly used verbs which can be followed by object

         clauses. Most of these verbs also take concrete objects naming

         persons or things. In this section we will show how object clauses
         are used following the transitive verbs omuche/ ‘begin’ and mo                        (8) a.        Ak mlo merek e/ remurt er a eai el klok.
         merek ‘finish, stop’. Sentences containing the sequence omuchel/                                    ‘I stopped running at eight o’clock.’
         mo merek + object clause simply tell us that the subject begins or                         b. Ak mlo merek ¢/ mesuub            a tekoi er a Merikel er tia el mlo
         finishes a particular activity; the activity which is begun or finished                         merek el rak.t
         is of course expressed by the words of the object clause.                                           ‘I finished studying English last year.’
               In the examples below, the object clause following omuchel                          c.        Ak mla mo merek e/ meruul er a blai.
         ‘begin’ has been italicized:                                                                        ‘I’ve finished working on the house (for today).’                  Ak mo omuchel e/ mengiis er a kliokl er a klukuk.                                d.

                  ‘Droteo began to study English during the war.’                                  f.        Ke mla mo merek ¢/ melamech a dekool?
                                                                                                             “Have you finished smoking your cigarette?’
         As the examples above show, an object clause can be followed by
         a relational    phrase:     thus,   the temporal   phrases   er a klukuk                  g.        A Droteo a mo merek ¢/ mengiis er a kliokl er a klukuk.

              The transitive verb omuchel ‘begin’ can also have a concrete                    form and meaning of mo merek ‘finish, stop’. As we saw in
                                                                                                                                                        13.6,

328                                                               OBJECT CLAUSES          OBJECT CLAUSES                                                                     329      is put in the past tense. Instead, the past tense marker -/- is infixed                           b.   A chull a mla mo merek.
      into the directional verb mo to give mlo merek, as observed in                                         ‘The rainy season has ended.’      8a—b. Examples 8c-f show that the auxiliary word mila (cf. 5.3.2.1)
      is simply placed before mo merek to indicate recent past time;                      OBJECT CLAUSES        FOLLOWING TRANSITIVE STATE VERBS

      form of the directional verb mo, can be used to denote a future
      event         (cf.   13.4),    as evidenced   by   the   accompanying   temporal            verbs can be identified by the following two features: first, like

      phrase er a klukuk ‘tomorrow’.

                                                                                                  not be capable of’—can be followed by concrete objects as well
      In 8f, for example, the speaker is asking someone on a particular
      occasion (say, before a class is to begin) whether or not he has
                                                                                                  as object clauses. In the sentences             below,   these verbs appear
      finished smoking. Such a question is quite different in meaning
                                                                                                  followed by concrete objects:
      from the following:                                                                         (12) a.    Ak meduch er a ochur.

      (9) Ke mla choitii a omelamech el dekool?
                    ‘Have you quit/given up smoking cigarettes?’                                        b.   Ak metitur er a misil er a sidosia.
                                                                                                             ‘I don’t know anything about (fixing) car motors.’
      As opposed to 8f, 9 asks the person addressed whether he has                                     When      meduch     ‘know   how   (to),   be skilled   at’ and   metitur

      like 9 will be examined further in 17.8.9                                                   clauses:
           The verbal expression mo merek ‘finish, stop’ need not be
      followed by an object clause as in the examples of 8 above; thus,                           (13) a.    Ak meduch el omekall a sidosia.
      as the examples below illustrate, mo merek can also take a con-                                        ‘I know how to drive a car.’

           When nio merek is used as a transitive verb, as in 8 and 10                                 In 13.5 we saw that the directional verb mo ‘go’ can be used
      above, its subject must be animate (usually human). But when                                as an auxiliary word preceding state verbs to designate a change
      mo merek is used intransitively, as in the following sentences,                             of state. Since meduch ‘know how (to), be skilled at’ and mefitur
      its snbject will be inanimate:                                                              ‘not know how (to), not be capable of’ are state verbs, they can

                  In 16 below, the transitive verb melasem ‘try’ is followed by                                however, in which the unexpressed subject of the object clause is
          a concrete object, while in 17 it takes an object clause:                                            understood differently, as in the example below:          (16) a.        Ke mla melasem er a sasimi?                                                          (20) A Toki a milgngetakl er a Helen el mo er a bulis.
                         ‘Have you tried out/tasted the sashimi?’                                                  ‘Toki persuaded Helen to go to the police with her,’                  b.     Ke melasem er ngak?                                                                   In 20, the subject (Toki) influenced some other person (Helen)
                         ‘Are you challenging me?’
                                                                                                              to do a particular action (i.e., go to the police). In other words,
                  c.     Ke mla melasem er a Droteo?                                                          the action of going to the police was carried out by the person
                         “Have you tried (to ask/consult) Droteo?’                                            persuaded (Helen) rather than the person doing the persuading

                         “Have you tried out/checked your car?’                                               mo er a bulis ‘go to the police’ is not identical to Toki, the subject
          (17) a.        Ak millasem el menga er a ngikel.                                                    of milengetakl ‘persuaded’, but rather to Helen, the noun imme-

                         ‘Have you ever tried driving a car?’                                                 one naming the person influenced or affected by the persuasion

        compare the following:

        While soak is followed by the concrete noun biang ‘beer’ in la,                               If we formulate the source sentence of 35 as described above,
        the sequence following soak in 33 has some of the characteristics                     we can easily account for the resulting sentence of 35 in terms of

      we use the directional verb mo ‘go’ as an auxiliary. In such cases,
      use of mo not only designates a future event but also implies a
      change of state (cf. 13.5.1). Observe the following equational
      sentences in the future tense:      (63) a.    A ngelekek a mo sensei.

      sentences, which are identical in meaning:                                            something into a conversation as new information and at the same

      Unless we accept the validity of the subject shifting and preposing                   ignate things which were already presumed to be part of the

      The sentences of 13 describe changes of state in which the italicized                 ‘wasn’t, didn’t exist’. At first glance, the form dimlak seems very
      subject noun phrases ududek ‘my money’, chull ‘rain’, and urerel                      difficult to explain, since it appears to contain an unusual infixed
      ‘his work’ became non-existent—i.ec., stopped, disappeared,                           variant of the past tense marker—namely, -mil-. But if we assume
      became used up, etc. Thus, in spite of their English equivalents,                     that diak is a state verb, at least some of the apparent irregularity

            There is further evidence that the negative verb diak combines               In the a-sentences above, use of dim/ak—the            past tense form of

      observe the negative word dirkak ‘not yet, not ever’, which is                     specific occasion.      By contrast,   use of dirkak   in the b-sentences

      the structure of dirkak:                                                           that someone       has never had the experience of doing something.

      When viewed this way, 14b seems to be a denial (or opposite) of                         As in 14b, the negative verb dirkak can also refer to some
      14a and as such should contain the negative verb diak. We pro-                     event which as of the present moment has not yet occurred. In
      pose that 14b indeed does contain diak, but as part of the word                    such cases, dirkak corresponds to ‘not yet’, as in the sentences
      dirkak. In other words, the source of dirkak in 14b seems to be the                below:

      question is interpreted in this way, B’s responses to it are different   CONDITIONAL     SENTENCES
      in meaning from those observed in 56-7 above, as the following
      dialogs illustrate:
                                                                               19.1.   As we saw in 18.4, Palauan hypothetical verb forms are required

                ‘Don’t you eat papayas?” =                                             sentences with diak, however, but appear in a large variety of

                “No, I don’t. (I don’t eat them.)’
                                                                                       and the following sections.

                ‘Don’t you eat papayas?’ =                                             a condition and a consequent—and express the idea that if some
                ‘Is it the case that you don’t eat papayas?’
                                                                                       event, action, state, etc., occurs, then something else will happen.

      If we think of A’s question as really meaning ‘Is it the case that               would   bring about   or which   would   result from   it is called the
      you don’t eat papayas?’, as mentioned above, we can easily                       consequent. The meaning of these two terms will become clear
      explain how B’s responses are interpreted. Thus, when B answers                  from the following example:
      chochoi in 58, he actually means ‘Yes, it is the case that I don’t               (1) A Iengar er ngii a ududek, e ak mo er a Guam.
      eat papayas’. Similarly, B’s use of ng diak in 59 corresponds to                     ‘If I had money, (then) I'd go to Guam.’
      “No, it is not the case that I don’t eat papayas—i.e., I do eat them’.
      As the English equivalents show, the way of answering such nega-                 In the above conditional sentence, the condition a@ /engar er ngii a

        consequential clause first and the conditional clause last. Thus,

                                                                                        sentence    is a yes-no     question      derived   from   the a-sentence      by
               ‘Droteo has arrived.’
                                                                                        subject shifting, and the c-sentence is another yes-no question

               ‘Has Droteo arrived?”(13) a.        A resechelim a mlo milil er a kederang.                                  (14) a.    A dort a meduch! el                 ‘Ironwood is a strong tree.”

ple conclusion that the yes-no questions are derived from the
statements by the process of subject shifting (cf. 17.2). Since the                          b.    Ng mlo dekimes a ears?              ‘Did the sail get wet?’
shifted subject Droteo of 12b is singular, the 3rd pers. sg. non-                            c.    A ears ng mlo dekimes?
emphatic pronoun ng appears as a pronominal trace. In 13b,
however, the shifted plural subject resechelim ‘your friends’ leaves                         If the subject of a statement sentence is a noun phrase of
the 3rd pers. (human) pl. pronominal trace te. As expected, the yes-                    possession, then three acceptable yes-no questions can be formed
no questions of 12b and 13b are spoken with a rising intonation;                        from it. Thus, in the pair of sentences below,
this feature of their pronunciation differentiates them from

trasts with the following:                                                                         ‘Is Droteo’s wife pretty?’(12b’)        Ng mla me a Droteo.                                                       the yes-no question of 16b is derived from the statement of 16a
              ‘Droteo has arrived.’                                                     by shifting the subject bechil          a Droteo ‘Droteo’s wife’, which is a
                                                                                                   a
412                                                                             QUESTIONS              QUESTIONS                                                                        413           noun phrase of possession. Now, from 16b, we can form either of                                    shifting from equational source sentences of the form subject
           the following yes-no questions, which have the same meaning:                                       noun phrase + techa ‘who?’. The derivation of 18a is therefore
                                                                                                              represented according to the following scheme:

                 d.        A Droteo ng klebokel a bechil?
                                                                                                                                                         ‘Who is your teacher?’
           The difference between the derivations of 16c-d is as follows:
                                                                                                              The equational source sentence of 19 must undergo the process
           in 16c, the whole shifted subject bechil a Droteo ‘Droteo’s wife’
                                                                                                              of subject shifting in order to become grammatical. As a conse-
           is preposed, while in 16d only the possessor Droteo is preposed,
                                                  noun   bechil ‘his wife’   in sentence-final                quence of this process, the subject noun phrase sensei er kau

            position (cf. our discussion of preposing of possessor

                 Another example parallel to 16a-d is given below:

                                                                                                              derived in exactly the same way, except that their source sentences

      normal position occupied by an         object noun phrase—namely,                 applicable only when ngara functions as sentence object (cf. note

        If the clause introduced by me has a specific third person subject,                as follows:
        then this subject can be preposed to sentence-initial position,                    (54) A resechelim a telang.          (source sentence) —
        leaving behind a pronominal trace. Thus, with 48d, compare the                          Te tela a resechelim?           (by subject shifting) >
        sentence below, whose meaning is the same:                                               A resechelim te telang?        (by preposing of shifted subject).
        (49) A resechelim ngara me te sileseb a blai?                                      Since the source sentence of 54 is not grammatical as it stands,
             “Why did your friends burn down       the houses?’                            subject shifting must be applied to it obligatorily. The resulting
              Another way of asking ‘why?’ in Palauan is to use ngara                      sentence, in which the shifted subject resechelim ‘your friends’
        followed by the obligatorily possessed noun uchul ‘its reason’                     leaves the pronominal trace te, is perfectly acceptable. Therefore,
        (cf. chap. 3, note 17), which is in turn followed by a clause in-                  application of the preposing rule in the last step of 54 is merely

        the sentences below:                                                               the entire shifted      subject    or to the possessor        alone   (cf.   16c-d

      preceding the anticipating state suffix. As we saw in 7.8, certain
      full vowels found in the basic stem of a verb characteristically
      turn up in anticipating state verbs, where they come to appear in
      stressed syllables. Exactly the same phenomenon is observed in
      the forms above: thus, if we propose a basic stem like kimud
      (cf. 7.8, ex.31) for ‘cut’, we can explain forms like ulengmudel
      ‘hair that is cut off? vs. mengimd ‘cut (hair)’ in the following way.
      In wlengmidel, the i of the basic stem kimud is deleted in an un-
      stressed syllable, while the w is maintained in a stressed syllable.
      In other words, ulengmuiidel is derived by the following steps:

¥O2 1,1,   Although we have been dealing with the causative prefix ome(k)-                                                                              verbs in ome(k)-
                                                                                                         derive their ergative forms according to two different patterns
           as a single unit (or morpheme), there are several facts which lead                                                                                            .
                                                                                                         One of these patterns, which is close to becoming
           us to believe that it is really a combination of three elements.                                                                                archaic (i.e.,

           Before discussing these facts, we first need to examine the basic                                                                                                                   in ergative

                 As you can see, the basic structure of ome(k)- consists of two                          by the verb stem (e.g. me + dasech ‘be/get carved’, me + chuiu
           elements with which we are already familiar—the verb marker                                   “be/get read’, etc.). We should therefore expect that the ergative
           and the imperfective marker—and one clement which is new to                                   forms of causative verbs would also lack the imperfective marker,
           us—the causative marker bek. As discussed in 5.5, the imperfective                            and this is precisely the case: in other words, the obek- of obek-
           marker has several variants—/, ng, or n—depending on the initial                              dakt ‘be/get frightened’, etc. consists of the following simple
           consonant of the following verb stem. Even though the causative                               sequence:
           marker bek is not a verb stem, its initial consonant b nevertheless
           determines the correct variant of the directly preceding imperfec-                            (7)   Verb marker +-        causative marker
           tive marker, which is therefore represented as m in 6 above. The                                           °          +              bek
           verb marker which is part of the structure of 6 appears as o-
           (rather than me-) as a result of dissimilation (cf. 6.1); here, the                           As the formulas in 6 and 7 clearly show, the only difference
           dissimilation is caused by the presence of the bilabial consonant                            between the imperfective and ergative forms of causative verbs
           b in the following causative marker. The actually-pronounced                                 is that the former contain the imperfective marker, while the
           form ome(k)- is derived from the basic structure 0+ m+ beh                                    latter do not.
           by deletion of the initial consonant b of the causative marker:                                     Third, as we will see in 9.4 below, the perfective forms of
           this is exactly the same phenomenon which we observed in the                                 causative verbs in ome(k)- normally do not show an initial o-.
           derivation of imperfective verb forms (cf. 5.5), where the initial                           For example, the 3rd pers. sg. object present perfective form (cf.
           consonant of a verb stem is characteristically deleted following                             6.3) of omekdakt ‘frighten’ is mekdektii ‘frighten him/her/it’. The

           ‘carve’, me + ng + chuiu — menguiu ‘read’, etc).                                             way if we assign it a basic form whose elements are consistent with
                 There are several facts which we can bring up as evidence                              those given in 6 and 7. Recall (cf, 5.5) that Palauan perfective
           that the formula given in 6 correctly represents the basic structure                         verb forms of course do not contain the imperfective marker;
           of ome(k)-.      First,    we   have   already        mentioned     above   that the         therefore, a perfective form like sosebii ‘burn it’ has the basic
           non-occurrence of causative forms like *omekmedakt or *ome-                                  structure verb marker + verb stem + object pronoun. The basic
           kmared (instead of omekdakt ‘frighten’ and omekared ‘light, oe                               Structure of the perfective forms of causative verbs is similar,
           on’, respectively) could be easily explained if ome(k)- itself already                       except that the causative marker is added following the
                                                                                                                                                                    verb
           contained the verb marker, as in 6: in other words, the non-                                 marker. Thus, the basic form of mekdektii ‘frighten him/her/it’
                                                                                                                                                                        is
           occurrent causative forms would be incorrect because they would                              represented as follows:
           contain two instances of the verb marker—i.e., word-initial 0-
                                                                                :                       (8)    Verb marker       +- causative marker +- yerh stem

                  Second,    the formula      in 6 allows us to account            for certain                            o     +             bek          4           dakt    +           ii

               In 6.3.1 we noted that Palauan perfective verb forms are                                      omengim   ‘make...drink’                         melim ‘drink’

          reasonable     to assume     that such        metathesis   also   occurs   in the          In each of the causative verbs of 10, the velar stop k of ome(k)- is

          here, the metathesized verb marker has been moved to a position                                  Since a sentence with a transitive verb has both a subject

           more rule is applied—namely, the rule reducing unstressed a to ¢

      any immediately preceding / assimilates to the r, as in orrebet                                         Some discussion of the structure of mo- was presented in 9.2.2.1

      The reciprocal verbs in 16a-c are related to the stems of intransitive
                                                                                                Some additional examples of this use of ka- are given in the

      same place, etc.—although no reciprocity is involved. However,                             b.     Kalgbo Igmgchiuaiu a Toki, e desa el kmo ng mo ungil ng diak.
      some Palauan speakers feel that sentences like 16a-c have a special                               Let’s have Toki go to bed and we'll see if she gets better.’
      connotation      of “group    spirit” or “togetherness”.    For example,                   c.     Kabgskak tilecha ¢l oluches.
      kadereborb ‘sit together’ of 16c seems to include the idea of some                                “How about giving me that pencil?’
       special comradeship      existing between    the men who    were   sitting
       together.
             Another extended function of the reciprocal prefix is to
       weaken certain commands or suggestions, or make them more
       polite. In this usage, the reciprocal prefix ka- is added directly to
       the hypothetical forms of verbs (cf. 4.10 and 4.10.1-9). Its presence
       suggests that the speaker and the person addressed are somehow
       mutually involved in the decision at hand; often there is a strong
       sense of the speaker’s concern or sympathy. Note the contrast
       between the following pairs of sentences:

      object of the verb open, in 49b my office door appears as the sub-                        or unimportant. This point is illustrated clearly in the dialogs
      ject of open and designates the thing which undergoes the action                          below, in which B’s responses to A’s questions contain ergative
      of opening. Thus, 49b appears to be rather similar to the Palauan                         verbs in various past tenses:
      ergative sentences given in 47b and 48b. Note, however, that
      while the same verb form—opens—is found in both of the English                            (51) A:   Ng dirk ngar er ngii a biang?

      sentences, the Palauan sentences in 47 and 48 show different but
      related verb forms—i.e., ergative mechat ‘be/get smoked’ vs.                                   B:   Ng diak. Ng milengim er a elii.
      imperfective (transitive) megngat ‘smoke’, etc. Though sentences                                    ‘No. It got drunk up yesterday.”
      like 49b are not very common in English, Palauan sentences like                           (52) A:   Ng dirk ngar er ngii a kall?
      47b and 48b are found quite frequently.                                                             ‘Is there any food left?’
            Ergative verb forms in the present tense have a special inter-                           B:   Ng diak. Ng mla mekang.

      precautions against some expected future event. (Do you recall                            (53) A:   Ng dirk ngar er ngii a hong el kirel el donguiu?
      any other Palauan verb forms which are used in the same way).                                       ‘Are there still some books we have to read?”
      Note, therefore, the following sentences, in which the present                                 B:   Ng diak. Ng mla mechuiu el rokui.

            As the sentences below illustrate, ergative verbs can be pre-              that of ergative verb forms, which consist of the two-morpheme

                     klok.                                                             can be derived from the former simply by putting the imperfective
                   ‘Droteo’s store will open at seven.’                                marker between the verb marker and the verb stem (see the ex-

                   “My room is going to be painted tomorrow.’                          i.e., /, ng, or m—depending on the initial consonant of the fol-

                   ‘My clothes will get washed   this afternoon.’                      imperfective marker has been determined, the initial consonant

       Unlike the examples of 50, the sentences of 55 (though still                    we have the ergative verb form mechuiu ‘be/get read’, which con-
       ergative) do not have any sense of warning or precaution. These                 sists of the verb marker me- and the (bound) verb stem -chuiu
       sentences simply express a future event with emphasis on the                    ‘read’. To derive the corresponding imperfective verb form, we
       event itself rather than on the person responsible for the event: in            need to “fill in” the formula me + imperfective marker + chuiu
       55b, for example, our attention is drawn to the fact that the room              with the appropriate form of the imperfective marker. As we will
       will get painted, but it is not important to know by whom. Because              see below, the imperfective marker appears as ng if the following
       of this difference of emphasis, we cannot at all say that 55a-c                 verb-stem-initial consonant is ch. Thus, we get the sequence me +
       and the following “corresponding” transitive sentences are                      ng + chuiu, which,after deletion of the verb-stem-initial consonant
       equivalent in meaning or function:                                              gives us the correct imperfective form menguiu ‘read’.?
       (56) a.    A Droteo a mo melai er a chesmerel a stoa er ngii er a euid                In the light of the above discussion, we can see that it was

                   ‘A friend of mine is going to paint my room tomorrow.’              simply by replacing ch with ng; what actually happens is that ng

          ones. More specifically, we saw how two simple sentences like the
                                                                                        combined in such a way that they are related in terms of cause

          (1) a.   A Droteo a uleba a oluches. ;                                        explains the cause or reason for the event or situation described
                   ‘Droteo had/was using a pencil.’                                     in the preceding clause, while in 4b me ‘(and) so’ introduces a

          in different orders, we derive the following two sentences:

               b. A Droteo a milluches a babier el oba a oluches.                            Since Palauan reason clauses are not difficult to understand,
                   ‘Droteo was writing a letter with a pencil.’                         we will simply give a few additional examples here:

          and in 2b     we find an instrument clause (cf. 15.3). The dependent              b. A ngelekek a diak Isebechel ¢l mo milil er a elecha e le ng kirel

           Following the analysis given in 8b above, the non-hypothetical                                  Palauan hypothetical verb forms characteristically lack the verb

       some of the major structural features of Palauan perfective verb
       forms. Thus, in 4.9 and 4.9.1-4 we considered the form and                                      melatech ‘clean’:                       melecholb ‘bathe, baptize’:

       structures of perfective vs. imperfective verb forms and noted                                  meleel ‘nail’:                          melekosek ‘cut (meat)’:
       that in the former type, the verb marker always appears as an                                   dmelii              dilelii             sokesekii          silekesekii

               fying the object pronoun suffixes: as we saw in 4.9 and 4.9.1-4,                               characterized by the fact that the verb marker must metathesize
               the third person singular object pronoun is -ii, or less frequently,                           with the initial consonant of the following verb stem in order to
               -ngii or vowel + r (ir, ur, ete.), while the third person plural non-                          produce the form which is actually spoken. In some cases the
               human object pronoun is -@. The phonetic effect of these two                                   metathesized verb marker appears as -m-, while in others it
               object pronoun suffixes is quite different and of great importance                             changes to -u- or -o-, or even disappears completely. We will now
               to a correct analysis of the phonetic alternations in perfective                               examine the phonetic factors which account for the various forms
               verb forms. Since the third person singular object pronoun is                                  of the metathesized verb marker.
               always stressed, all of the syllables of the verb stem are invariably                               As we saw in 6.2 above, the appearance of the metathesized
               unstressed in perfective forms like dolemii ‘plant it’, Jongir ‘borrow                         verb marker as -w- or, rarely, -o- in certain intransitive verbs seems
               it’, etc. On the other hand, since the third person plural non-                                to be the result of dissimilation: in other words, in intransitive
               human object pronoun @ has no “phonetic content”, it of course                                 verbs like suébek ‘fly’, chudrm ‘suffer’, etc., the metathesized verb
               can never be stressed; therefore, in perfective forms like dudlem                              marker changes from the bilabial consonant m to the vowel u
               ‘plant them’, /méng ‘borrow them’, etc., the stress falls on one of                            (or o) if another bilabial consonant (6 or m) occurs in the verb
               the syllables of the verb stem. The consequences of this difference                            stem and if the adjacent vowel is stressed. The very same principle
               in the placement of stress will become obvious below.                                          of dissimilation will account for a good number of the 3rd_ pers.

               perfective verb forms as follows:                                                              in the words     below,     the metathesized   verb   marker   (italicized)

VERBS WITH mile AND -i/- IN THE PAST
13>     A small number of Palauan verbs have two past tense forms, one                 TRANSITIVE STATE VERBS

                                                                                              lowing      two   features:   first,   they   take   objects   because     they    are
        respectively (cf. 5.1.3), we must conclude that the verbs in question
                                                                                              transitive; and second, their past tense forms are derived with

        clear that the verbs mekar ‘be awake, wake up’, and dmik ‘live
        away from, move out of’ are being used as state verbs: therefore,                     All of the transitive state verbs given above—medenge ‘know’,

        in 9b and 10b tells us that mekar and dmik are functioning as                         involve mental states (knowledge of something, fear of some-

        denote actions or events rather than states.                                                The transitive state verb medenge ‘know’ has a full set of
             There are several other Palauan verbs which have two past                        perfective forms—i.e., medengelkak ‘know me’, medengelkau
        tense forms, but unlike the cases above, the use of one or the other                  ‘know you’, medengelii ‘know him/her/it’, etc. (cf. 4.9.4, ex. 53).

SOME    SPECIAL      POSSESSED           NOUNS
3.11.     A small group of nouns referring to liking, disliking, ability,
          and obligation always occur with possessor suffixes. The possessed
          forms of these nouns are shown in the simple sentences below:
          (35) Ng soak a biang.
                 ‘I like beer.’
          (36) Ng chetil a rrom.
                 ‘He dislikes liquor.”
          (37) Ng sebechir el mong?
               ‘Can they go?’
          (38)   Ng kirem el mong?
                 ‘Do you have to go?’          Though the English equivalents contain verbs or ‘helping’ words
          like can and have (to), the Palauan sentences use possessed nouns
          to express the same concepts: 35, for example, contains the
          possesssed noun soak ‘my liking’ and means, literally, ‘My liking
          is beer’. For a complete analysis of sentences like 35-38, see
          17.1 and 17.3.

       pronouns are observed to occur.                      Perhaps the most common      of          ‘you’, ngii ‘he/she/it’, etc.
       these is after the word er. Recall that in 2.7 we distinguished                                     In the following sentences, an emphatic pronoun follows the
       between the specifying word er, which identifies a specific object,                           relational word er:
       and the relational word er, which expresses certain types of re-
       lationships (mostly spatial and temporal) and has a large range of                            (17) a.       A sensei er ngak a me er a party.

       We find that the emphatic pronouns of Palauan can occur fol-                                          b.    A delmerab er tir a kmal kikiongel.

       of sentences:                                                                        (26) a.     Ng meringel a chimal a Droteo.

                                                                                                   c.   Ng Iluich me a etiu a rekil a Toki,
       (24) a. A ralm a mekelekolt.         ‘The water is cold.’
                                                                                                        ‘Toki is twenty-nine years old.’
            b. Ng mekelekolt a ralm.
                                                                                                   d.   Ng suebek a rengul a Droteo.4
       While the a-sentences have their subjects at the beginning (as we                                ‘Droteo is worried.’
       would expect), in the b-sentences the subjects have been shifted                            e.   Ng ngar er ngii a party er a blil a Toki.
       to the right of the verb phrases (¢/a me ‘has come’ in 23 and                                    ‘There’s a party at Toki’s house.’
       mekelekolt ‘cold’ in 24). If we consider the a-sentences to be basic,                       f.   Ng diak a urerek er a elechang.
       we can simply say that the b-sentences are derived from them by a                                ‘I don’t have any work now.’       process of subject shifting. When a sentence subject is shifted in                          g.   Ng soak a Toki.
                                                                                                      ‘I like Toki.’
       this way, a trace of it remains in its original position in the form of
       a non-emphatic pronoun. In the b-sentences above, the sentence-                             h. Ng chetil a kohi.
                                                                                                        ‘He dislikes coffee.’
       initial third person singular non-emphatic pronoun ng stands for
       the singular subjects Droteo and ralm ‘water’, which have been                       In sentences 26a—d the shifted subjects chimal a Droteo ‘Droteo’s

       human plural, then the third person plural non-emphatic pronoun                      ‘Toki’s age’, and rengul a Droteo ‘Droteo’s heart’ are all noun
       te ‘they’ appears as a trace of it in sentence-initial position. This is             phrases of possession which designate a specific third person
       illustrated in the following pair of examples:                                       possessor (cf. 3.6). For 26a~-c, the corresponding sentences with

     we were correct in stating that the sentence subject is shifted to                (32)   A Droteo ng mla mei?
     the right of the verb phrase rather than to the very end of the                             ‘Has Droteo come?’

     26a-d, and 26g-h, shifting the sentence subject to the right of the                      “Have your friends come?’
     verb phrase also placed it in sentence-final position, since these               (34) A bechil a Droteo ng klebokel?

     sentences have no relational phrases.
          The process of subject shifting is also used to form certain                Although 32, 33, and 34 do not differ in meaning from 29b, 30b,

      the subject (Droteo) performed the action of reading at some time
                                                                                                                   For example, in the pair of sentences below, the auxiliary word
      point in the past (e/ii ‘yesterday’). But the similarity ends here,
      since the two verb forms involve a very basic difference in the                                              mia (cf. 5.3.2.1) precedes the imperfective and perfective forms of
      speaker’s viewpoint. Thus, in 2a the speaker uses imperfective                                               the action verb mengiis ‘dig’ and refers to an event or activity in
      milenguiu ‘was reading’ to focus on the past action as it was going                                          the very recent past:
      on or in progress. The action is described as having continued for                                           (5) a.       Ak mla mengiis er a kliokl.

      In other words, it is entirely possible that Droteo still has some of                                               b.    Ak mla kiiesii a kliokl.

      has no more of the book to read.                                                                             the task is not yet complete; on the other hand, use of perfective

        Compare, for example, the following two sentences:
                                                                                              another person Y whether or not Y is an eater of fish: perhaps X

                  ‘I’m writing the letter now.’                                               perhaps X is just inquiring in a polite way whether or not Y likes
             b.   Ak luchesii a babier er a elechang (me ke mesang).     ;                    fish. In 15b, on the other hand, X is asking Y whether Y can eat

        In 13a, imperfective meluches simply denotes that the action of                       etc., 15a is of course not restricted in this way. The following
        writing is taking place (i.e., in progress) at the present moment,                    sentences show the same type of contrast:

        about to start writing the letter.

             Because     present   perfective     verb   forms   have   the   above-
        mentioned connotation of imminency, they are often found in                                 b.   Ng sebechem el ngilmii a imelem el biang?

        A few typical examples are given below:                                               Note that the object in 16a is general (biang ‘beer’), while that in

        word er results in an important difference in meaning, as the                       mental differences of function and meaning. Our analysis of the
        sentences below illustrate:                                                         nature of these differences is confirmed when we look at the

              The use of the specifying word er is restricted in two inter-
        esting ways. First, it never occurs with sentence subjects, but                    (21) a.     Ak mla menguiu er a hong e ng di dirkak kbo kmerek.
                                                                                                       ‘L have been reading the book, but I haven’t finished it yet.”
        only with sentence objects; and second, it can only precede the
        objects of imperfective verbs. With the objects of perfective verbs,                     b.    ?2Ak mla chuiguii a hong e ng di dirkak kbo kmerek.

        cality of 20b shows:

        (20) a.    Ak chillebedii a bilis.                                                 while 21b has a perfective verb form. In the sentences above,

              It is possible to speculate on the reasons why the specifying                sense. By contrast, since perfective mla chuieuii of 21b explicitly
        word er cannot precede the objects of perfective verbs. Every                      states that the subject has finished reading the book, it is con-
        perfective verb form, you will recall, contains an object pronoun                  tradictory, and therefore unacceptable, to add e ng di dirkak kbo

        Palauan perfective verb forms in and of themselves imply a speci-                  expression introduced by e ng di ‘but’ is somewhat different:
        fic object, and use of er to further indicate the specificity of the

THE     THREE    DIRECTIONAL         VERBS     OF    PALAUAN                                     (2) A:         Ng sebgchem el mo er a blik er a klukuk?

13.1.      In this chapter we will examine a special subgroup of Palauan
                                                                                                         B:     Chochoi. Ng sebechek el mo er a blim er a klukuk.

           eko ‘go’, and me ‘come’. As we saw in 5.1.1, Palauan intransitive
           action verbs denote actions which involve only a doer, but no                        Note, first of all, that the sentences in the dialogs | and 2 involve
           receiver. In other words, intransitive action verbs do not take                      some future event, since they contain the temporal phrase er a
           objects because they name actions in which only the doer can                         klukuk ‘tomorrow’ (see 14.6). Though the English equivalents
           participate rather than describing actions which are directed at                     for the sentences of 1 and 2 do not reflect it very clearly, most

           tional verbs differ from each other in meaning.                                      arrival: it is possible, for example, that A is requesting B to go to

                                                                                                be present.!
13.2.      The directional verb me corresponds to English ‘come’ and refers                              When eko ‘go’ is used, the past, present, or future location of
           to movement towards the place where the speaker is, was, or will                    the person addressed is usually his own house, as in 1B, but it is
           be. This verb contrasts with both mo and eko, which refer to                        also possible for some other location to be involved, as the fol-
           movement away from the place where the speaker is, was, or will                     lowing sentences illustrate:
           be and therefore correspond most closely to English ‘go’. The
           difference in meaning between mo and eko depends in an im-                           (3) a.        Bo era bita e a Droteo a ekong.

           to (i.e., the hearer). The directional verb eko has the very specific                    b.        Bo er a blil a Toki e ak ekong.

           of the person addressed. By contrast, the directional verb mo is                                   ‘Til be there, so wait for me.’
           much broader in scope, since it describes movement by anyone—                        Note, further, that sentences like the following

           In 10a the present tense form me ‘come’ indeed refers to an action                  verb. Other auxiliary words which we have seen so far include mle
           which is happening at the present moment (i.e., at the time when                    “was, were’, which is used to indicate the past tense of state verbs
           the speaker utters the sentence); this is made clear by the accom-                  (cf. 5.1.3), and mia, which indicates a recent past eyent or past
           panying temporal phrase er a elechang ‘now’. In 10b, however,                       experience (cf. 5.3.2.1).
           the very same present tense form me ‘come’ is used to refer to an                        How can we explain the fact that the present tense forms of
           action which is expected to happen in the future, at the time point                 Palauan directional verbs can function to express future actions or
           designated by the temporal phrase er a klukuk ‘tomorrow’. Like                     events? It appears as if the basic meaning of these verbs, which is
           10b, the sentences below involve a future action or event, except                  to describe movement across physical space from one location to
           that they contain the directional verbs mo and eko:                                another, has been extended to cover “movement across time”

           (11) a.       A Droteo a mo er a Guam er tia el me el rak.                         future. This kind of meaning change, in which directional verbs

           followed by a state verb can designate either a recurrent change of
           state or a future change of state. In 13d-g, the change of state                      (14) a.   Ak omerolek ¢l mo ungil el smecher er a tereter.
                                                                                                           ‘I'm in the process of getting better from my cold.’
           occurred at some time point in the past, with m/o + state verb in
           13d-e and mla mo + state verb in 13f—g distinguishing relatively                           b.   A beluu er a Hawaii a omerolel el mo kikiongel.
           remote vs. relatively recent past time points, respectively.®                                   ‘The land in Hawaii is getting dirty/polluted.’
                All of the sentences of 13 draw our attention to a resulting                          c.   A skuul a omerolel el mo meseked.
           state—that is, to a state which has come about as the result of                                 ‘The school is getting (more and more) crowded.’
           some        process    of change.   This   resulting state is explicitly (or               d.   A tangk a omerolel el mo mui.
           overtly) expressed by the particular state verb which follows mo.                               ‘The tank is getting filled,’
           By contrast, the initial state—i.e., the state which existed when                          e.   Asils a omerolel ¢l mo meringel.
           the process of change began—is not overtly expressed, but merely                                ‘The sun is getting hotter (and hotter).’
           implied in the sentences of 13. For example, in 13f, the state verb
           bekebau ‘smelly’ describes the present state of the food (resulting,                 In the examples of 14, the possessed forms of omerael ‘process’
           say, from the food’s having been left in a warm place) and is                        must agree with the sentence subject. Thus, in 14a, the /st pers. sg.

           state expression, see chap. 15.
                                                                                            tive verb: in other words, it is followed by a specific object which is
                 The abovementioned use of omerael ‘process’ followed by a

           change     of state expression    does not represent the only way    of
                                                                                            which is in some way related to the imperfective transitive verb
           describing a current change of state. As we saw in 11.12.4, the
                                                                                            merkui ‘finish’?, never changes its form. Therefore, in order to
           inchoative forms of state verbs—e.g. mekelekelta ‘getting cold’
                                                                                            indicate the past tense with mo merek, it is the directional verb

           following:

13:5.1:    It is also possible to have change of state expressions in which the                  d.   Bo mrei!

SPECIAL    VERBAL        EXPRESSIONS         WITH     mo
13.6.      There are a few Palauan words which must always occur preceded
           by a directional verb. The resulting expressions, of which mo
           merek ‘finish’ and mo/me reme ‘go/come home’ are perhaps the
           most common, function as verbs. Observe, for example, the fol-
           lowing sentences, which contain instances of mo merek ‘finish’:
           (17) a.    Ke mo merek er a subelem er oingarang?
                      ‘When are you going to finish your homework?’

§:1.4.     Whereas nouns make reference to human beings, concrete things,                           As opposed to transitive action verbs, intransitive action verbs
           abstract ideas, and the like, verbs name actions or states which                    involve only a doer, but no receiver. In other words, these verbs do
           involve nouns in various ways. Action verbs describe actions,                       not describe actions which can be directed at someone or some-
           activities, or events and can be transitive or intransitive. Transitive             thing else, but rather actions in which only a doer participates.
           action yerbs name actions which characteristically have a doer                      For this reason, sentences with intransitive verbs like the follow-
           and a receiver. As we saw in 2.3, the doer (or person who performs,                 ing never contain object nouns:

          As the examples of 13 and 14 show, a major difference in the                           Though we will examine sentences like 15-16 more carefully
      way past tenses of verbs are formed can be explained according to                     in later chapters, we can understand enough about them to see
      the basic distinction between action verbs and state verbs. In other                  that, in this case, too, the distinction between action verbs and

           A second way in which action verbs and state verbs behave
      differently is with respect to the use of mo ‘go’ as an auxiliary.          DISTRIBUTION         OF   PALAUAN        VERBS
      Both types of verbs can be preceded by mo ‘go’ (or its past tense           5.2.      In a preliminary and much oversimplified discussion        of the Pa-
      form milo ‘went’), but the resulting meanings are totally different.

1.4.4.       The six vowels listed in the chart in 1.4 above are among the
             significant sounds (or phonemes) of Palauan. It is possible to find
             minimal pairs which show how the various vowels contrast with
             each other in otherwise identical environments. Note, for example,
             the minimal pairs kar ‘medicine’—ker ‘question’, char ‘price’—
             chur ‘laughter’, kid ‘we’—ked ‘hill’, and delék ‘my nail’—delék
             ‘my abdomen’. In the last minimal pair cited, the vowels e and ¢
             contrast in an unstressed syllable. Since ¢ occurs only in unstressed

             syllables, it is extremely difficult to find minimal pairs which show
                                                                                                             vowels are at the edges or extremes. From the point of view of

             to be explained below, many linguists would not recognize the

            The appearance of word-final [a] in the examples of 31 illustrates

            ends in a sequence of two consonants, this cluster of consonants is
            followed        by a schwa      release (which          is of course          unstressed).     1.4.6.      All the full vowels of Palauan except a can occur long. These
            Because the schwa release is predictable and speakers always                                               long vowels are spelled simply by doubling the letter—i.e., ii, uu,

     explained above can be found in two classes of words, personal
     names and words of foreign origin. First of all, many Palauan
     personal        names—e.g.          Francisco,   Polycarp,      Hermana,      etc.—are
     borrowed from other languages and therefore contain certain
     sounds which are not native to Palauan. In order to spell these
     sounds, it is necessary to use non-Palauan letters such as p, f, j, y,
     and w. Furthermore, the spelling of many native Palauan names,
     including personal names like Yaoch, Polloi, etc. as well as place
     names like Peleliu, Kayangel, etc., does not conform exactly to the
     rules presented above. We should not be surprised or disturbed
     that Palauan personal names in particular show so much deviation
     from the “standard” rules of Palauan spelling. This is perhaps as
     it should be, since names are very individual things.
           Second, words of foreign origin—especially technical terms—
     often appear in Palauan speech. Since these words contain sounds
     which are not native to Palauan, it becomes necessary in some
     cases to use non-Palauan letters. If the word is borrowed from
     Japanese and contains no sounds strange to Palauan, it should
     be possible to spell this word only with Palauan letters, as in basio
     ‘place’ and iasai ‘vegetables’. If, however, the Japanese word con-
     tains sounds which do not occur in Palauan, then it is necessary to
     use non-Palauan letters such as z and /.!1 Words of this type in-
     clude    daiziob      ‘all right’,     skozio    ‘airport’,    benzio    ‘toilet’, Autsu
     ‘common,          usual’, kohi ‘coffee’, and keizai ‘economics’.                  If the
     borrowed word comes from English—e.g. government, post office,

     So far we have only looked at the hypothetical forms of verbs                  As we will see in 5.3.2.1, 5.3.3, and               19.7.2, Palauan       has several
like mesuub ‘study’, melim ‘drink’, meluches ‘write’, msa ‘give’,                   types of complex verb phrases which consist of two, or possibly
mo ‘go’, me ‘come’, etc., all of which designate actions or activities.             three, separate words. Some typical examples of such verb phrases

        Those causative verbs derived with the prefix ome(k)- (cf. 9.2.1)                     REDUPLICATION            OF     RECIPROCAL            VERBS

        or ki—is inserted between the e (which may then be deleted) and                       11.10.   As we saw in 10.2.3, ex. 12, some reciprocal yerbs exhibit an

        report the statements or assertions of some third party. In so                 serves to introduce clauses that describe someone’s statement,

        the examples of 21.1-4 above can be replaced by e/ ua se. This
        expression consists of the dependent clause introducer e/ followed                                c.   Ng mera gl tekoi ¢l kmoa Maria a mlo bechiil?

        by wa ‘like, as’ and se ‘that’. Thus, in a sentence like the following
        (16) A Droteo a dilu el ua se ng smecher.
             ‘Droteo said that he was sick.’
        the specifying clause introduced         by e/ ua se gives us further in-
        formation about the verb di/u ‘said’ by describing the content of
        the statement made.
             For many Palauan speakers, e/ kmo and e¢/ va se can be used
        with complete interchangeability, regardless of whether direct or
        indirect quotation is involved. Certain speakers, however, seem to
        use e/ ua se primarily for direct quotation. For other speakers,
        the use of e/ kmo ys. e/ ua se involves a difference of implication,
        as illustrated by the following two examples of indirect quotation:
        (17) a.   Ak rirenges el kmo a sensei a miad er a elii.
                  ‘I heard (about the fact) that the teacher died yesterday.”
             b.   Ak rirenges ¢l ua se a sensei a mlad er a elii.
                  ‘I heard (something to the effect) that the teacher died yester-
                     day (but is it true?)’        As the rather free English equivalents are designed to show, e/
        kmo of 17a implies that the speaker is fairly sure about the factu-
        ality of what he has heard, while e/ va se of 17b implies that the
        speaker has doubts about the truth of the event designated by the
        indirect quotation. Because Palauan speakers show so much
        variation in the way they use ¢/ Amo and ¢/ ua se, it is difficult to
        formulate any general principles; therefore, no further discussion
        will be pursued here.","[223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228]"

TRANSITIVE      VERBS      DERIVED       FROM       STATE      VERBS
19.     A rather large number of Palauan transitive verbs are derived
        from simple state verbs merely by adding the verb marker and the

20.7.   Palauan has a special verb mekera ‘do what?’ which can only be
        used in question sentences. Since mekera is a verb, it can occur in
        various tenses: thus, we have milekera or mlekera in the past
        tense (cf. 5.3.2) and mo mekera in the future tense. Some typical
        sentences containing mekera ‘do what?’ are given below:

                       ‘What shall we do (now)?
