"3.6 Demonstrative pronouns
The demonstrative pronouns express proximity, number and gender, and are as
follows:
Masculine              Feminine                Plural
ijinaki                aijinaki                kapinaki                this
                       d^i'ni                  kapi'ni                 that
  The ^ of naki- is optioiially prenasalised — e.g., ijinaijki instead of ijinaki—and
kapi- has a variant ijampi-e.g., ijampinaijki instead of kapinaki.
   These pronouns may either replace a nominal as subject or object or in any other
syntactic position, or may be used as attribute to a nominal. In either case there
IS agreement of number and gender between pronoun and nominal:
aijinaki pilimuija               This is a road
ijuwitBmaunti ijinaki            I want this one
ta^iara ijVni                    Tell that man
Ijinaki pdlaijdmwani pumpuni     This dog is good
aijinaki pslaijdmwaka pumpuka This bitch is good
kapinaki pdlaijdmwawi pumpuwi These dogs are good
   There is also a set of demonstratives which are unmarked for proximity —
awara (rnasculine), awutjira (feminine) and awuta (plural). These may be translated
 that, that one, those’, ‘those ones’, or ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘they’, according to context,
iheir typical uses are illustrated in the following examples:
awara jiikdjimi, purukupauli       He made it, Purukupaili
Uafa awara jiikauimi               He made it
iipauliyi, awunira pmirjiariija    It fell down, that tree3.7 Interrogative pronouns
The interrogative pronouns are as follows:
Masculine             Feminine             Plural
kuwani                kuwaija              kuwapi                     who?
kamini                kamuija              kamuwi                     what?
For example:
kuwani j(iik3J3wala                Who sang?
kamini nampitamamti                What do you want?
kuwani ijdnaki                     Whose is this?
                                                                         573.8 Negative pronouns
The negative pronouns are as follows:
Masculine           Feminine                Plural
karakuwani          karakuwaija             karakuwapi       no one
karakamini          karakamupa              karakamuwi       nothing
For example:
karakuwani jinimatakupauli        No one will come back
pia karakamini                    I’ve got nothing3.9 Impersonal pronouns
The impersonal pronouns (which are used like English ‘someone’, ‘something'
but not like French on or German manri) are as follows:
Masculine            Feminine            Plural
aramukuwani          aramukuwatja         aramukuwapi       someone
aramukamini          aramukamu^a          aramukamuwi       something
For example:
kuwani jUkauimi ?   aramukuwani
Who did it?         Someone or other
kamini iji'ni?   aramukamini
What’s that?     Something or other

                                                                     SYNTAX0   WORD CLASSES
The word classes are defined by reference to the kind of meaning they express,
syntactic function and morphological structure. The main division is between full
words (those which express ‘lexical’ concepts such as ‘man’, ‘tree’, ‘water’) and
function words (those which are used to establish syntactic relations and express
grammatical concepts such as ‘past’, ‘plural’, ‘first person’, and which do not ‘occur
by themselves’ in the same sense that full words do). Full words are items of semantic
substance, as it were, while function words are among the signals which are used
in organising these items of substance into sentences expressing the relations between
them. Full word classes are usually large and open while function word classes are
small and closed.
  The two major word classes are nominals and verbs, and the other full word classes
are verbal nouns, predicatives, adverbs and interjections. The function words are
pronouns, negative adverbs, tense markers, introducers, conjunctions and prepositions.
  Nominals are the names of ‘things’ in a very general sense (i.e., persons, animals
or inanimate objects), have a characteristic morphology expressing gender and
number, and can function as subject or object of a sentence, as well as in other
roles such as instrument. They are subdivided into nouns (e.g. tdraka, ‘wallaby’,
iaputa, ‘camp’, ajawunirjkui, ‘spear’) and adjectives (e.g. pumpuni, ‘good’, j^uti,
‘bad’, ajikulani, ‘big’). Adjectives refer either to a ‘quality’ (again in a quite general
sense) or to a thing having that quality. They share all the syntactic functions and
the morphology of nouns {pumpuni, for example, may mean ‘the good one’ as well
as ‘good’, auikulani may mean ‘the big one’ as well as ‘big’), but differ from nouns
syntactically in their ability to function as modifier of a noun or verb.
   Nouns are subdivided into proper nouns (e.g. iipuwalaniwiti'wi (personal name),
marakawijaija (place name)) and common nouns (e.g. tiijati ‘sand’, wiija ‘sea’), and
adjectives are subdivided into common adjectives (e.g. jurukuni ‘long’, kauuwuni
‘short’) and numerals (e.g. jiraja ‘two’, pu^iniijita, ‘five’).
   Verbs are words which name ‘activities’, have a characteristic morphology ex¬
pressing tense, aspect and mood, among other things, and function syntactically
as the predicate of a sentence. They are subdivided into full verbs (e.g. iuwuffjlsraumani
‘she was cooking’, jinipakupauli ‘he came back’) and auxiliary verbs (e.g. yduimi
‘I did’, jjduima ‘I did’). The function of auxiliary verbs is to fill the Auxiliary slot
in Periphrastic verb phrase (e.g. joi tjdjimi ‘I danced’, literally ‘dance I-did’). There
are only four auxiliary verb stems-mi, -ma, -pi and -kauimi—but the last of
these also functions as a full verb.
   Verbal nouns are words which have verb-like meaning but lack the morphological
structure and syntactic function of verbs (e.g. joi ‘dance’, kutupi ‘jump’, ani ‘give’).
                                                                                         59Being entirely without inflexion for person, tense, etc., they cannot stand alone as
predicate but have to be supported by an auxiliary verb which conveys the necessary
grammatical information (e.g. ani auimi ‘he gives’, literally ‘give he-does’).
   Predicatives are words with adjective-like meaning (e.g. jitana ‘sick’, paj^wani
‘hungry’, pujluki ‘thirsty’), but which lack the morphological structure of adjectives
and the capacity of adjectives to function as modifier in a head-modifier construction,
and are restricted to predicative function (e.g. kiijlini jitana ‘the baby (is) sick’,
ijia pauawani ‘I (am) hungry’).
   Adverbs are words which function as a verb modifier. These are subdivided into
temporal, locative and manner adverbs (e.g. patjari ‘tomorrow’, maji^ara ‘on this
side’, mamana ‘quietly’).
  Interjections are words which do not have any syntactic role in sentence structure
but occur in isolation (e.g. aja ‘hey!’, a'yi ‘oh!’, kuwa ‘yes’).
   Pronouns are words which stand for a noun, in the sense that they can be used to
replace a noun in most of its syntactic functions. They have no lexical meaning,
however, and are restricted to expressing the grammatical concepts such as person,
number and gender, which are abstracted from the noun. They are subdivided into
personal pronouns (e.g. ijia ‘T, tjara ‘he’), demonstrative pronouns (e.g. ya'ni ‘that one’,
tjanaijki ‘this one’), interrogative pronouns (e.g. kuwani ‘who?’, kamini ‘what?’) and
negative pronouns (e.g. karakuwani ‘no one’, karakamini ‘nothing’).
  The negative adverbs are kau'lu and ajnuijkwa, which are freely interchangeable,
both meaning ‘not’. The tense markers are waija ‘past’ and wi ‘future’. The introducers,
whose function is to introduce paragraphs and serve as signals of discourse structure,
are ki, au and amantia. The conjunctions, which are all subordinating, are kari
‘when’, pili ‘because’, and ijani, a general subordinator with no specific meaning.
The prepositions (of which there are only two — kapi and kayi) function as general
relators in relator-axis phrases, e.g. kapi tiijata ‘to the beach’, kayi tiijuwini ‘in a
hollow tree’. Neither has any specific locational/directional meaning and either
may be translated ‘to’, ‘at’, ‘on’, ‘in’, ‘by’, etc., indifferently. Specific locational/
directional meanings have to be expressed by locative adverbs such as jila'ju ‘below’,
kaji'u ‘above’, e.g. jipaputi kaui'u kapi jutjuijkwa ‘he went up above, to the sky’.","[72, 73, 74, 75]"
"3.1.4 Possessor orientation
Possessor orientation means the relating of a nominal to another nominal which
stands as its possessor, the two being juxtaposed in the order possessor-possessed
without any case inflexion or other overt mark of their relationship.
jarakapai     tuwaua           the crocodile’s tail
crocodile     tail
jarakalani jimata                  the turtle’s intestines
turtle      intestines
The possessor may be pronominalised
ijara tuwaua             his tail
nira jimata              her intestines
and the inclusion of a preposed pronoun within the possessed phrase may be used
as a means of indicating the relation between the two nominals. In this case the
pronoun functions like the genitive s in English, although the bracketing is different,
jarakapai     ijara      tuwaua         the crocodile’s tail
 crocodile    his        tail
jarakalani     iiira jimata            the turtle’s intestines
turtle         her intestines
In the case of kinship terms the possessive pronoun is obligatory.
purukupauli          ijara   mauani          Purukupajli’s son
Purukupajli          his     son
jarakati     ijara     punajiija       Jarokati’s wife
 Jarakati    his       wife
The order of possessor and possessed may be reversed provided that a pronoun is
preposed to the possessor phrase.
                                                                                      75^ara   punaji^a jarakati       Jarakati’s wife
his    wife     Jarakati
^ara   tuwcua jarakapai        the crocodile’s tail
his    tail    crocodile3.1.5 Goal orientation
Goal orientation is the process for forming a phrase consisting of two nominals,
which are related to one another in deep structure as action and goal, the two being
juxtaposed in either order without any case inflexion or other overt mark of their
relationship.
ijaputjkajqjini Jlaraka    a good hunter of wallaby
good hunter     wallaby
praka      rjapu^kauajini        a good hunter of wallaby
wallaby good hunter
This type of phrase may be regarded as derived by a nominalisation process from an
underlying sentence in which there is a verb corresponding to the action nominal,
e.g. fjapuijkauajini j[araka ‘a good hunter of wallaby’ from auapimi iaraka ‘He kills
wallabies’.","[90, 91]"
"1.3 Unstressed vowels
The vowel phonemes described in 1.1 and 1.2 are established in syllables with
primary word stress. In most unstressed syllables and in syllables with secondary
stress there is a weakening of vowel contrasts (mainly a weakening of the /// - /w/
contrast) brought about by a tendency to centralisation, and this leads to difficulty
in the phonemic identification of vowels in these syllables.
   Tiwi words usually have primary stress on the penultimate syllable. This is preceded
by an indefinite number of weak (unstressed and secondarily stressed) syllables,
which together constitute some kind of an onset to the stress nucleus, and followed
by a single unstressed syllable which functions as a closure. Some typical examples
would be ^mtauakauawdla, ‘I sang’, and jaratjkali/jdpa, ‘face’. The problem of vowel
reduction has to be seen within this framework, as absence of primary stress is the
immediate cause of the weakening of vowels.
   Even in syllables with primary stress the distinction between /// and /«/ is not
always clear, but, in this position, the tendency to centralisation is generally not
strong enough to bring about a complete neutralisation. Somewhat centralised
vowel sounds do occur in stressed syllables but the phonemic identity of these usually
becomes apparent in a more precise articulation.
   In word-final unstressed syllables there is no tendency to centralisation at all.
In this position /w/ and joj are excluded and the system of contrasts is limited to a
distinction between a very clear /// and /a/. The especially close, tense nature of ///
in this position is one of the features which signal the end of the word. In longer
words, consisting of two or more stress groups, the same tense, close realisation of
/// is used to signal the end of each stress group, particularly when stress groups
coincide with incorporated stems, as they often do.
   The neutralisation of the /// - /u/ contrast thus does not affect either syllables
with primary stress or word-final unstressed syllables, but is confined to the un¬
stressed or weakly stressed syllables preceding primary stress. If there is only one
such syllable the distinctiveness of the vowel may be retained, but, if there are two
14or more, the front-back contrast tends to disappear (e.g., as in fdpatapuni, ‘owl’,
and praijk3pijluni, ‘crocodile’). As joj rarely occurs in weak syllables the system
of contrasts in these syllables is in practice reduced to a simple binary opposition
between ‘open’ and ‘close’ vowels, a and a, and even this opposition is constantly
threatened by a tendency to centralise the open vowel as well. For example,
jtarika'lanil, ‘turtle’, is sometimes realised as [tardka'lani]. There is thus, in Tiwi
unstressed and weakly stressed syllables, a tendency to dispense with vowel con¬
trasts altogether, although this tendency is usually resisted sufficiently to keep the
open-close contrast operative.
   The phonemic identity of the weakened close vowels generally cannot be re¬
covered through morphophonemic processes or by other means. That is, it is
usually not possible to say with any confidence of such a vowel whether it is derived
— either diachronically or synchronically — from an /// or a /w/. It would evidently
be useful for the purpose of phonemic transcription if every one of these weakened
vowels could be traced back to its source, but there is no way of doing this.
   In English we are always easily able to recover the phonemic identity of our weak
centralised vowels, both through our knowledge of the traditional spelling forms
(which are a constant reminder of the underlying identity of any particular weakened
vowel), and through our knowledge of the morphophonemic processes which syn¬
chronically relate unstressed vowels to their stressed counterparts (as, for instance,
the unstressed first and third vowels in /fa'tvguafil are traced back to their underlying
values in I'foutdguafl). In Tiwi, however, these means of phonemically identifying
unstressed vowels are not available, as there are no traditional spelling forms to
refer to, and as — Tiwi stress being in a fixed position relative to the word boundary,
regardless of the class of word — vowels which appear in an unstressed position
in one word are almost certain to appear in a similarly unstressed position in any
related words. There is thus little hope of discovering the phonemic identity of
Tiwi weakened close vowels.
   The actual phonetic quality of the weakened close vowels varies very considerably,
as there is no contrast at all on the front-back dimension in weak unstressed syllables.
The phonetic norm for the close vowel unit which results from the neutralisation
may be considered to be [a], as this is about the centre of the area of variation, but
actual realisations vary all the way from [j] to [u], the variation being partly free
and partly conditioned. There is a strong tendency for the vowel to be retracted
and rounded between a labial and a velar consonant — e.g., in environments such
as /p-kl and Ip-ijj — and for it to be advanced to a close front position following
/// or preceding /a/, but, in other environments, the quality of the vowel varies
freely from [/] to [v]. The following verb forms, which all contain the incorporated
stem meaning ‘egg’ (roughly dtjandtjd-), will give some indication of the nature of
the difficulty. ijdAama^iijanBiju'Ai, ‘I took the eggs’; awdniiij9matdij9niijd'mu, 'Ut's
sitting with some eggs’; jimdntiijaniijapu^ita'puni, ‘He hit me on the ear with an
egg’; ijantapuijdnirjiatjkdld'wini, ‘I saw the eggs’. As the examples show, the vowels
of the stem meaning ‘egg’ are all close but they vary so considerably on the front-
back and rounded-unrounded dimensions that no phonemic identification is possible.
   In this situation, the spelling of the weakened close vowels is a problem of some
difficulty, to which there is no entirely satisfactory solution. Briefly, since a phonemic
identification of these vowels is impossible for the reasons given above, there are
just two ways of approaching the problem of spelling them. These are: (a) to represent
every weakened close vowel as a, regardless of its actual phonetic quality; (b) to
attempt a phonetically impressionistic rendering of them using a variety of phonetic
symbols, (a) has the advantage of being phonological (since a is the symbol which
identifies the close vowel unit which results from the neutralisation of the /// - /w/
contrast), but the disadvantage of being too conventional for reading purposes,
as vowels which are retracted or advanced by the environment to [c/] or [i] cannot
very happily be transcribed as a. For this reason solution (a) has to be abandoned
and (b) preferred, although this leads to constant uncertainty in the spelling forms
because of the free variation referred to above.
                                                                                            151.4 Restrictions on occurrence
There are various restrictions on the occurrence of the phonemes relative to word
boundaries and stem boundaries and these are stated below. Restrictions on the
occurrence of the phonemes relative to syllable boundaries are given in section 2.
   The restrictions on the occurrence of the consonants are as follows; (a) no
consonant may occur in word-final position; (b) one group of consonants —              j, /, r
and y — never (or rarely) occur in word-initial position; (c) another group — the
nasals n, n and ij — have their word-initial occurrences almost entirely restricted
to one or two small classes of morphemes; (d) p, k, m and w are the only consonants
which may occur initially in verb stems.
   The restriction on the occurrence of r and y is absolute, as no word in the lexicon
begins with either of these two phonemes. (The form ri'tjani, ‘father’, begins with r,
but kinship terms are always so closely related to the obligatory personal pronoun
which precedes them that they have to be regarded as bound forms. The point is
that ri'ijani can never occur by itself and so r never occurs initially in the utterance.)
The restriction on the occurrence of u and /, on the other hand, is not absolute,
as there is a tiny percentage (much less than one per cent in each case) of words
which begin with these phonemes, for example mtu'wati, ‘island’, uu'wuti, ‘heart’,
lanika'pini, ‘smoke’. The Tiwi find considerable difficulty in saying word-initial j,
and, in the few words in which this phoneme occurs initially, it is often preceded
by a slight introductory vocalic glide. Thus uatu'wati, for example, is often pro¬
nounced [ajati/wati]. The introductory glide in these cases has no phonemic status
but is merely a conditioned feature of u in this position.
   It is evident, from the restriction on their occurrence, that j, /, r and y have some
kind of secondary status as consonants in Tiwi. What they have in common, from
an articulatory point of view, is absence of a complete closure, and perhaps it is this
which disqualifies them for word-initial use. Historically, it may be that these
phonemes were a late development in the history of proto-Australian, resulting
from phonemic splitting in intervocalic position, and that their use has never become
 more generalised.
   The word-initial occurrences of tj, n and ij are almost entirely restricted to personal
pronouns, subject prefixes, certain pronominal prefixes, conjunctions and preposi¬
tions, in much the same way (and for much the same reason) that word-initial d
is restricted to pronouns and articles in English. The effect of the restriction is to
distinguish nominals (which rarely begin with n, n or rj) from verbs, pronouns, and
particles, which often do. The number of nominals beginning with n, n or rj is very
small — in each case less than one per cent of the total inventory of nominals in
the lexicon. Some examples are ni'ijani, ‘spirit’, namatja'rau, ‘red ochre’, and
ija'jiija, ‘black cockatoo’.
   The restrictions on the occurrence of the vowels are as follows: (a) word-initial
position — a is the only vowel to occur at all frequently in word-initial position.
/ and o do not occur word-initially, and u does so only very infrequently (e.g., in
u'puija, ‘grass’, u'pwani, ‘fly’). Word-initial ji can be mistaken for i as the semi¬
vowel is difficult to perceive in this environment. Morphophonological changes of
the vowel, however, make the semi-vowel quite apparent. For example, j is difficult
to perceive in the third-person prefix ji- as in ji-i-ka'uimi, ‘He did it’, but quite obvious
when the vowel is changed as in ju-'apa, ‘He ate’. The presence of J in Ji- is proved
by its presence in Ju- as there would be no way of accounting for the alternation
i-'^ju-; (b) word-final position — unstressed word-final vowel is restricted to i or a,
though u may occur in word-final stressed syllables. This restriction is a means of
marking word-final boundaries.","[29, 30, 31]"
"1.1.13 Emphasis
The emphasis concept is restricted to imperative verbs and is expressed by the prefix
Ca-:
ta-pu-a'ji    Go away! (emphatic)

{Ca- -> pa-, ja-, ta-, la- or ra- depending on the morphological environment. See
Morphophonology, 2.1.)1.2 Theme structures
1.2.1 Structures
Theme is the structural level at which lexical concepts such as ‘meat’, ‘fish’, ‘fight’,
‘run’, are incorporated into the verb. The incorporation of such concepts is optional.
                                                                                     47however, as there are always alternative means of expressing the same concepts
outside the verb. A minimal verb theme — i.e., one into which nothing has been
incorporated — consists simply of a verb stem. Either one or two forms, typically
functioning as adjunct and object, may be incorporated into this structure, preceding
the stem. If two are incorporated adjunct precedes object — i.e., the maximum
structure is adjunct + object + verb stem:
ji-mon-taijkina          He stole it from me
 he-me-steal
Ji-rmn-alipi-aijkina           He stole my meat
 he-me-meat-steal
ji-m3ni-tjilimpatj3-raijkina         He stole it from me while I was asleep
 he-me-sleeping-steal
ji-m3ni-ijilimpa^-alipi-atjkma         He stole my meat while I was asleep
 he-me-sleeping-meat-steal
  The incorporation as object of forms referring to parts of the body is restricted
to very few verbs — notably -ni, ‘hit’, -tja, ‘grab’, and -kuwirarji, ‘burn’:
ji-m3ni-rja       He grabbed me
 he-me-grab
ji-m3ni-k3Ji-ija         He grabbed me by the hand
 he-me-hand-grab
ji-m3ni-marikuatj3pi-^a          He grabbed me while I was dancing
 he-me-dancing-grab
ji-m3ni-marikuai]3p3-k3ji-ija        He grabbed me by the hand while I was dancing
 he-me-dancing-hand-grab
   Intransitive verbs naturally can have no object, incorporated or otherwise, but a
few very common intransitive stems — notably -u'ui, ‘go’, - mu, ‘sit’, and -amaunipa,
‘get up’ — allow the incorporation as adjunct not only of all the verb-like forms
listed below but also of the noun-like forms, provided these are preceded by man-,
‘with’, and such incorporated structures are generally the translation equivalent
of English object:
ju-u'ji       He went
 he-go
ji-i-mar-u'ui          He took it
 he-lk-with-go
ji-i-mari-tjiliwariiu^-u'ji      He took the wallaby
 he-lk-with-wallaby-go
li-ni-pamaunipa          She got up and came
she-loc-get up
jli-n3-ji-ma-j(amajnipa          She got up and brought it
she-loc-lk-with-get up
ii-n3-ui-mari-kiaw3l3ij3-ramajnipa         She got up and came with some crabs
she-loc-lk-with-crab-get up1.2.2 Incorporated forms
The incorporated forms are divided into three groups — first the forms with verb¬
like meaning, which typically function as some kind of adjunct; secondly the forms
with noun-like meaning, which typically function as object but which can also
function as adjunct (in the few verbs specified above) if mari- is prefixed to them;
and thirdly, the forms referring to parts of the body, which can only function as
object and only in the few verbs mentioned.
 48    In the lists which are given below, incorporated forms are placed side by side with
 the corresponding free forms or verb stems for the purpose of comparison, and
 (t) is used to indicate cognate pairs. Incorporated forms and free forms are generally
 not cognate, however, as the free forms which were cognate with the existing in¬
 corporated forms have long since disappeared, owing to the rapid rate of lexical
 replacement in Australian languages.
    The number of incorporated forms is small compared with the number of free
 forms and verb stems in the lexicon, and it is thus apparent that there are many
 free forms and verb stems which have no exact equivalent in the list of incorporated
 forms. The reason for this is that the meanings of the incorporated forms are
 generally less specific than those of the free forms. For example, there are about
 fourteen words referring to different types of wild honey, but there is only one
 incorporated form referring to honey, and this has generic meaning — i.e., it does
 not discriminate between the different types. In this way a relatively small number
 of incorporated forms can cover the same semantic area as a much larger number
 of free forms, but finer distinctions of meaning are lost as a result.
    The incorporated forms undergo a number of morphophonological changes, or
 induce changes in other morphemes, as follows: (1) Forms marked Ilb take initial
 p, t, t or r, depending on the morphological environment (see Morphophonology,
 2.3), e.g., ipanirji-, ‘egg’ -> pitjanipi-, tipaniiji-, tipanipi-, or rujanitji-. (2) Forms listed
 with final fja- in parentheses have final tja- inserted preceding certain short stems
 such as - mu, ‘sit’. (3) Forms with final a require the insertion of initial r in a
 following lib stem, e.g., ji-, ‘he’ + paniija-, ‘raw meat’ + -amaunipa, ‘get up’
ji-i-paniija-ramajnipa, ‘He got up with the raw meat’.verb-like forms

The class of nominals includes both nouns and adjectives, the distinction between
these being that nouns are the names of persons, animals or things and adjectives
are the names of properties or qualities. Adjectives agree with nouns in number
and gender and the two classes are marked for these categories by the same formal
devices. Nominals are not inflected for case in Tiwi.","[62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]"
"3      PRONOUNS
3.1 Personal pronouns
The system of person concepts is based on a two-dimensional scheme, one dimension
being inclusion or exclusion of the speaker and the other inclusion or exclusion
of the hearer. This scheme yields a set of four persons, as follows: first person
(includes speaker but excludes hearer); second person (includes hearer but excludes
speaker); third person (excludes both speaker and hearer); and fourth person (includes
both speaker and hearer). There are two numbers — singular and plural — fourth
person singular being singular in the sense that there is only one speaker and one
hearer, and two genders — masculine and feminine — but entry into this system
is dependent on previous selection of third person and singular number.
    The personal pronouns are listed below:
Singular            1.     rjia               I
                    2.     mia                you sg
                    3.     rjara              he
                           ffira              she
                    4.     mua                you sg and I
Plural              1.     pawa       we ex
                    2.     nua        you pi
                    3.     wuta       they
                    4.     ijaya      we inc
  There is no case in Tiwi and the pronouns are used without inflexion in
syntactic position -- e.g., as subject intransitive. subject transitive, object
possessor:
ijia   pauBwani          I’m hungry
I      hungry
ijia   rjB-mdu-tiOmaunti       iji^^a     I want you
I      I-you-want              you
ji-mdni-piuni     tjia    He hit me
 he-me-hit        me
rjia jintarja   pukualamiri           My name is Pukualamiri
my name         pukualamiri
                                                                                      553.2 Emphatic pronouns
Emphatic pronouns, somewhat similar in function to the English emphatic forms
‘myself’, ‘yourself’, etc., are formed by adding a suffix -ila to the basic personal
pronouns listed above. Both -ila and the pronominal stems undergo morphophono-
logical changes in combining, but these changes are not described as all the emphatic
forms are listed below.
t]ilawa     myself                                yaw ila     ourselves (we ex)
fjiniila    yourself                              nuila       yourselves
ijatawa     himself                               wutawa      themselves
ffitawa     herself                               yawila      ourselves (we inc)
muwila      ourselves (you sg and I)
 Note that the emphatic forms, like the basic forms, may have any syntactic function
— e.g., subject, object or possessor — as they are unmarked for case:
ijilawa i]3-pa-kdMmi    I’ll do it myself
myself I-fut-do
kuwani ji-i-k3jimi? pir}Jiila?     Who did it? You?
who      he-lk-do    you
Ijiuiila   alawuja   your boss
your       boss3.3 Possessive pronouns
Possessive pronouns, which are the translation equivalent of English ‘ipy’» ‘your’,
etc., or of ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc., depending on whether they are used attributively or
predicatively, are formed by adding a class prefix ydtti-, ‘masculine’, ayi-, ‘feminine’,
or kapi-, ‘plural’, to the emphatic forms listed in 3.2.
Masculine               Feminine                Plural
yaniyilawa              ayilawa                 kapiyilawa              mine
yaniyiyiila             ayiyiila                kapiyiylila             yours (sg)
yaniyatawa              ayatawa                 kapiyatawa              his
yaniyitawa              ayiyitawa               kapinitawa              hers
yanimuwila              ayimuwila               kapimuwila              yours and mine
yaniyawila              ayawila                 kapiyawila              ours (ex)
yaninuwila              ayinuwila               kapinuwila              yours (pi)
yaniwutawa              ayiwutawa               kapiwutawa              theirs
yaniyawila              ayawila                 kapiyawila              ours (inc)
  Possessive pronouns agree in number and gender with the nominal which they
replace or to which they stand in an attributive or predicative relation;
ysniyilawa palayamwani              my (male) dog
ayilawa palayamwaka                 my (female) dog
kapiyilawa palayamwawi              my dogs
awurini yaniyilawa                  The male one is mine
jimpajliya ayiy^ila                 The female is yours
 yaniyilawa pumpuni                 Mine is good
  Both the basic personal pronouns and the possessive pronouns can be used as
possessor and the difference between them can be suggested by the difference be¬
tween English ‘my’ and ‘my own’, e.g., yawa pajlini, ‘our custom’, yaniyawila
pojlini, ‘our own custom’.
  The plural prefix kapi- has a variant yampi-, e.g., yampiyilawa, ‘my own ones’,
instead of kapiyilawa.
563.4 Collective pronouns
Collective pronouns, the use of which is demonstrated in the examples below are
formed by inserting a prefix rjati-, ‘all’, in the possessive forms listed in 3.3, after
the class prefix but preceding the pronominal stem:
rjdniyatmwila                      the whole lot of us
ijdnUjatmuwila                     the whole lot of you
rjdnvjatiwutawa                    the whole lot of them3.5 Reflexive pronouns
Reflexive pronouns are forrned by adding the reflexive suffix -amia to the emphatic
 orms listed m 3.2. Thus ijilawa -> yilawamia, ijintila -> ijintilamia, and so on:
ijdpaumi yilawamia      I’ll cook my own
iiikduimi ijintilamia   Did you make your own?","[70, 71, 72]"

                             AcknowledgmentsThis work, which consists of a Tiwi grammar, a collection of texts and a dictionary,
was begun in 1966 when the writer was a research scholar in Aboriginal Linguistics
at the University of Queensland, continued during 1967-70 at the University of
London, and completed in 1971-72 during a second period of field work in Australia.
It was supported throughout by grants from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal
Studies. The writer is most grateful to the Institute both for this support and for
the cooperation which they gave in all other matters.
   An earlier version of the grammar was submitted for a Ph.D. at the University
of London in 1970, and this was supervised in part by R.M.W. Dixon and in part
by R.D. Huddleston. Both gave much good advice and encouragement, and I wish
to thank them both for the many valuable improvements in the work which resulted
from their suggestions.
   Thanks are also due to the Welfare Division of the Northern Territory Adminis¬
tration and to Bishop J. O’Loughlin for their permission to work on Melville and
Bathurst Islands and for the assistance which they gave in all matters connected
with the work.
   The success of my periods of field work on Melville and Bathurst Islands — nine
months in 1966-67 and twelve months in 1971-72 — depended very greatly on the
cooperation of the superintendents of the settlements at which I stayed. I have to
thank Father John Fallon, Acting Superintendent of Bathurst Island Mission during
my stay there, and Jack Doolan and Ian Rodger, Superintendents of Snake Bay
Welfare Settlement at different periods, for their unfailing hospitality and cooperation
during the time I spent with them.
   I am also indebted to Dr Maria Brandi for her kindness in devoting some of her
valuable time to helping me to check some of my material.
   The heaviest debt of all of course is to the informants, who actually gave me the
 material and taught me their language, and especially to Laurie Nelson (i[ukuliai]3nila),
 Geoffrey Mungatopi (qapilimuquraja), Tobias Pilakwi (Juwujti), and Big Don
 (purupumaliua), who between them bore the main burden of many months of hard
 informant work with great patience and endurance. Their deep knowledge of the
 language and the perceptive way in which they explained it to me were the basis
 on which the description was built.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"
" 1.3 Typological characterisation
 Tiwi is a polysynthetic mainly agglutinative language,^ predominantly prefixing,
 noun incorporating, and of the type in which synthesis is in the verb. In other
 words it is a language in which all the elements of a sentence may be combined in
 a single highly complex morphological structure. The Tiwi verb is, in effect, a
 sentence in miniature, containing within itself not only pronominal reference to
 subject and object but also markers of tense, aspect, mood and voice, besides various
 other kinds of information, such as proximity and time of day. For example, the
 sentence ‘He came and stole my wild honey this morning while I was asleep’ may
 be translated by the single word jinuatdmamtjilipaijdmajlaiumafjsbpia^kina, and
 ‘He grabbed me by the foot as I was dancing in the evening’ by the single word
jimanikdmarikuaydpBmalitja. This potential for developing morphological structures
 of such a very high degree of complexity, while fairly common in North America,
 is quite exceptional in Australia. Nothing quite like it has been found anywhere
 else in the continent, or on the Australian islands.5
    Most striking and unusual of all (for an Australian language) is the capacity which
 Tiwi has for incorporating noun-like forms into the structure of the verb, principally
 as direct object. For instance, in the first of the two examples given above, the noun
 object ‘wild honey’ is represented by the incorporated form majlajluma^abpi-, and,
 in the second, the noun object ‘foot’ is represented by mali-. In this feature of its
 syntax Tiwi is almost unique in Australia, as, although noun incorporation has
 been reported in a few other Australian languages,^ its development in these
                                                                                       3languages is only in a very embryonic stage. Strangely enough, almost exactly
similar noun incorporation is found in certain American Indian languages.”^1.4 Genetic relations
Although it is clear from the deep structure, semantics, general morphological
type and phonology that Tiwi is an Australian Aboriginal language, there is very
little that can be said at present about its genetic relations with other Australian
languages. Work done by Capell (Capell 1940, 1942) has shown that prefixing
languages are mainly confined to an area in the north of the continent, and that
noun-classifying languages (like Tiwi) are also mainly in the north; Tiwi is con¬
sequently shown to have more in common with the languages of its area than with
the languages of other areas. There are a great many languages in this northern
area, however, and the work of establishing Tiwi’s genetic relationships with these
other languages has not yet made any progress.
    Lexical comparisons are quite useless for the purpose of establishing Tiwi’s
genetic relationships, as all that such comparisons ever reveal is that Tiwi has
virtually no lexical cognates with any other Australian language — even with
Jiwadja and Larakia, the two languages which are its closest neighbours geographic¬
ally, each being separated from it by only about fifteen miles of water. It is to be
assumed that Tiwi has been isolated from the mainland for several centuries, and
that, owing to the very rapid rate of lexical replacement under Aboriginal con-
ditions,8 the vocabulary has been almost entirely replaced during this period.
 Occasional cognates may be found in languages here and there, but the number
would never work out at even one per cent if expressed as a percentage of an
 adequate sample. It is thus fairly certain that Tiwi’s genetic relationships will riever
 be established through lexical comparison but only through structural comparison,
 but this work of structural comparison has yet to be undertaken.
1.5 Dialects
Before their concentration into the present settlements by European influence in
the twentieth century, the Tiwi were divided into fourteen regional groups or
sub-tribes, each of which lived and hunted in its own area, and, except on the
occasions of big tribal gatherings, did not have much contact with other groups,
except for those immediately adjacent to it. The most distant groups were separated
by well over 100 miles and must have had very little direct contact with one another.
There is thus some reason to expect to find appreciable dialectal differences in the
language.
   Whether there are in fact dialectal differences in Tiwi has not yet been established
as no formal study of this question has been attempted. It can be said, however,
that, if there are dialectal differences, they cannot be of a major order, as the
material collected for the present work was obtained from informants belonging
to various regional groups both on Melville Island and on Bathurst Island, and
does not reveal any obvious dialectal differences. Now it is probable that dialectal
study cannot be very fruitfully attempted, as the various regional groups have been
living together at settlements for some decades.
    Hart’s view that there is a special variety of the language for use in song and
ritual (Hart 1930a: 178) was substantiated, but time did not permit much study of
this variety of the language. It differs from normal spoken Tiwi very considerably
 in lexis, as many old words and incorporated forms which have died out in speech
 have been retained in song. However, it is unlikely that it differs from ordinary
 spoken Tiwi in syntax and morphology. The view expressed by some researchep
 that the women speak a different variety of the language from the men is entirely
 without substance. There is also no parallel in Tiwi to the ‘mother-in-law’ language
 (used for addressing certain relatives) found by Dixon in Dyirbal (1968:19).
1.6 The present state of the language
Tiwi is today one of the very few Australian languages which are still in full use
as the normal medium of communication for an entire tribe. The majority of
4Aboriginal tribes have already either disintegrated or disappeared completely, and
their cultures and languages have either already vanished or are on the point of
vanishing, but, protected by their isolated situation from the full impact of contact
with European culture, the Tiwi have been fortunate enough not only to survive
as a tribe but to increase their numbers, and to retain something of their culture,
including above all their language. Tiwi is thus in the remarkable situation of being
spoken as first language by as many as 1400 people (a large number by Australian
standards) at a time when the majority of Australian languages have been reduced
to no more than a handful of speakers.
   In spite of its success in surviving up to now, however, it cannot be expected
that Tiwi will survive as an effective medium of communication for very long into
the future. Education in English at the mission and settlement schools and constant
exposure to English in their everyday lives is rapidly diminishing the ability of the
Tiwi to speak their own language. People under forty speak and understand it much
less than those over sixty, and the present generation of children understand it less
still. It is to be expected that Tiwi will cease to function as a living language within
two or three generations, unless something is done to arrest the decline by en¬
couraging the use of Tiwi among young people, especially at schools.","[18, 19, 20]"
"Explanatory Notes
1 The people of Melville and Bathurst Islands have no true tribal name. Living
   in isolation from the rest of the world they never conceived of themselves as a
   tribe any more than they thought of Melville and Bathurst Islands as islands.
   Melville and Bathurst Islands were not islands to them but simply the world in
   which they lived and they themselves were not a tribe but simply the people of
   this world. They consequently called themselves simply tiwi — i.e., ‘human beings’
   as opposed to animals — as this was the only contrast which was relevant in
   their situation. When in relatively recent times the Melville and Bathurst Islanders
    began to come in contact with the outside world, the outsiders could not be called
    tiwi as they were simply not part of the conceptual structure within which the
    word has meaning. The islanders have thus gone on restricting the use of the
    term tiwi to themselves alone, and it has thus come to function, in effect, as a
    tribal label. The use of the word as a tribal name was first suggested by Hart
    (1930a: 169).
2 The Tiwi are known to have had sporadic contacts with Europeans from 1636
    onwards and there must also have been a certain amount of contact with
    Indonesians, as the latter are known to have visited the north coast of Australia
    regularly from the eighteenth century on. The Tiwi are also known to have carried
    out occasional wife stealing raids on the mainland. When viewed in proportion,
    however, these various contacts are seen to have been rather insignificant from
    the point of view of the history of the language. The picture must remain one
    of a language developing in virtual isolation.
 3 See Hart and Pilling (1960) for a brief account of some of the differences between
    Tiwi culture and mainland Aboriginal culture.
    Tiwi is agglutinative in the sense defined by Sapir (1921:129) in that the elements
     (or at least some of the elements) of the verb structure are ‘juxtaposed’ rather
     than ‘fused’ — that is, they remain psychologically distinct — and the meanings
     expressed by these elements are ‘radical’ rather than ‘relational’.
 5 See Capell (1942^:24).
 6 Capell 1956:35 mentions Groote Eylandt and Nunggubuyu as two other north
     Australian languages in which noun object may be incorporated.
 7 See Sapir (1911). Tiwi noun incorporation resembles the noun incorporation
     described by Sapir in North American Indian languages — especially that of
     Nahuatl and Paiute — in all of the following respects: (a) incorporation is
     restricted to only the commonest cultural items and to parts of the body; (b) any
     class affixes found in the independent nominal are lost in the incorporated form.
     Only the stem is incorporated and even this may be in a reduced form; (c) the
     incorporated stem usually functions syntactically as direct object but it may
     also have other functions — for example, instrument or locative. The morpho¬
     logical structure is the same regardless of the syntactic function of the incor¬
      porated stem; (d) in prefixing languages the incorporated nominal follows all the
      inflexional affixes and immediately precedes the verb stem.
  8 The very rapid rate of lexical replacement under Aboriginal conditions was a
      result of the practice of placing a taboo not only on the names of dead people
      but also on all words which sounded similar to those names. It is quite likely
      that under these conditions the complete vocabulary of a language would be
      replaced in the course of several centuries, and in the case of an isolated language
      like Tiwi, the replacements would not be words borrowed from other languages
      but new formations. See Hart (19306:281) for a discussion of this practice.

1.1 Phonemic systems
1.1.1 Consonant system
The Tiwi consonant system is a quite normal example of the general Australian
type. This type has a maximum of six places of articulation — bilabial, dental,
alveolar, alveo-palatal, retroflex and velar — but not all of these are used contras-
tively in every language. In many languages dental and alveo-palatal sounds are
merged in a single phoneme, and, in some, alveolar and retroflex sounds are
similarly merged. There are thus some languages with four, some with five, and
some with six contrastive places of articulation. There is always a complete set
of nasals, with one nasal corresponding to every stop. In addition there are always
at least one lateral, an alveolar flap, a retroflex vocoid, and two semi-vowels (palatal
and velar). There are generally no fricatives and features of a secondary type such
as voice, aspiration, aflfrication, velarisation and glottalisation are not used con-
trastively. The result is a fairly simple system with usually not more than about
fourteen to eighteen consonants. (See Capell, 1956 and 1962 for an account of the
common Australian consonant system, and for some examples of the type.)
   The Tiwi system is one of those which have only four contrastive places of articu¬
lation, dental and alveo-palatal sounds being merged in a single phoneme, and
similarly alveolar and retroflex. It differs from the norm in one trivial respect —
the possession of a single fricative phoneme.
   There are fourteen consonant phonemes, as follows: four stops — bilabial, jpj,
dental, /i/, alveolar, ///, and velar, /^/; four nasals with corresponding places of
articulation — bilabial, /m/, dental, /«/, alveolar, /«/, and velar, //;/; an alveolar
lateral, ///; an alveolar flap, /r/; a velar fricative, /y/; a retroflex vocoid, /i/; and
two semi-vowels — palatal, ///, and velar, jwj.

of the palatal semi-vowel in the ‘dental’ column and of the retroflex vocoid in the
10‘alveolar’ column, as ‘palato-dental’ and ‘alveolar-retroflex’ are in fact single places
of articulation in Tiwi.)
   Minimal or near minimal pairs are given below for those contrasts which may
seem less obvious.
/// — ///        Iman'tafjal, ‘woman friend’, jman'jlatjal, ‘a stick’.
/«/ — lul        jni'tjanil, ‘today’, Ini'tjaml, ‘spirit’.
lyl — /W                  ‘we inc.’, j'^awaj, ‘we ex.’.
jrj — /j/        lan'jloral, ‘wallaby’, Iji'^ouaj, ‘cabbage palm’.","[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"2.3 Embedding
A sentence may be embedded in a noun phrase or relator-axis phrase. A sentence
embedded in a noun phrase is inserted immediately following a noun which is its
underlying object. There is no relative pronoun or other overt sign of the embedding
process.
ydrdpdmani       knkwaui jiikdAdmani             I saw the pit he made
I-saw            pit      he-made
panaijki jardkapai          ijantajakajatjiri     This is a crocodile which I drew
this      crocodile         I-drew
A sentence embedded in a relator-axis phrase functions as axis exactly like a nominal.
muwitatjkauarinti yampi waija   puu'ji      mua mantawi
we-dur-go         to    already they-went our friends
We are going along to where our friends have gone.
awuta     pujakatajumi        kayi     pujamamani         They were strong in what they did
they      they-strong         where    they-did
3    PHRASES
There are noun phrases, verb phrases and relator-axis phrases, and these are des¬
cribed in 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 respectively. The noun phrases function like a noun, i.e.
as subject or object, or in any other syntactic slot filled by nouns, the verb phrases
function like a verb, i.e. as VP in a verbal sentence, and the relator-axis phrases
fill the locative slot in sentence structure.
3.1 Noun phrases
The processes for forming noun phrases are coordination, attribution, apposition,
possessor orientation, and goal orientation. These are described in 3.1.1, 3.1.2,
3.1.3, 3.1.4, and 3.1.5 respectively.
3.1.1 Coordination
The coordination of mutually independent nominals within a phrase is usually
achieved through juxtaposition and intonation alone, as there is no form equivalent
to English ‘and’. The process is recursive and there is thus, in principle at least,
no limit to the number of nominals which can be coordinated.
rjunirja jiliya     possum (and) carpet snake
kajiwa jurupuni          needle (and) vine
   It is usual for the coordinated nominals to have the same syntactic function in
sentence structure, e.g. mampuya jiikajimi kajiwa jurupuni ‘He used to make canoes
with needle and vine’, in which both kajiwa ‘needle’ and jurupuni ‘vine’ function as
instrument, but this is by no means always the case. It is quite common for nominals
which function as subject and object respectively to be coordinated, e.g. jipuyipa
yar uwani kayi pijaja, purukupajli japara ‘He hit his brother in the eye, Purukupajli
and Xapara’. (Purukupajli is subject and Tapara object.)
   Human nominals are sometimes coordinated by means of the personal pronoun
wuta ‘they’, inserted either at the beginning of the sequence, or between each member
of the sequence, or both.
purukupajli wuta tapara     Purukupajli and Japara
wuta japara waijai      Japara and Waijai
                                                                                     73wuta ta^ksfiaijki wuta jardma'jii wiita tuitjini
Xagkanaqki, Jarsma'ju and Jijigini
  Some speakers insert a form awi between coordinated nominals to indicate the
non-finality of the first, e.g. purukupaul awi mauimpunini ‘Purukupajli and
Majimpunini’, but this is entirely optional and appears to be restricted to a few'
speakers.","[88, 89]"

2.1 Noun classes
2.1.1 Concepts
The conceptual scheme which underlies the classification of Tiwi nouns is two-
dimensional, one dimension having the poles masculine and feminine and the other
human and non-human. There are thus four noun classes — masculine human,
masculine non-human, feminine human, and feminine non-human.
   The two genders have a natural basis in that all male human beings and male
animals are classified as masculine and all female human beings and female animals
are classified as feminine. Animals whose sex cannot be determined by observation —
e.g., birds, fish, reptiles and insects — have their gender established in traditional
mythology. For example, waijai, the bush curlew, is known as the wife of
purukupauli; kujipurani, the frilly lizard, and ijan^a, the black cockatoo, are known
as brother and sister; jla^kanarjki, the white-breasted sea eagle, is the husband of
ijajiija, and so on.
   Sex (actual or mythological) is not the sole basis of gender in Tiwi, however.
Physical size and shape are the factors controlling the assignment of gender to
inanimate things, the semantic features correlated with masculine gender being
‘small’, ‘straight’, ‘thin’, and those correlated with feminine gender being ‘large’,
‘round’, ‘ample’. The same features are used to assign gender to animals whose
sex is not known either from direct observation or from traditional mythology.
Consequently, wherever there are two similar things or animals which are distin¬
guished in Tiwi semantics as different kinds, the smaller or thinner one is classed
as masculine and the larger or broader as feminine:Masculine                                           Feminine
waliwalini         small ant                        waliwaliija   large ant
miauti             small pandanus                   miauiija      large pandanus
mutjkwani          small stone axe                  muijkwaija    large stone axematjiani           small stick                      matjla^a      large stick
lutjkwalUi         narrow headed spear              auawuniijkui broad headed spear
upuni               blade of grass                  uputja        grass  All trees are feminine (except in some cases when not fully grown) because they
are large, round and ample compared with mere sticks, which are all masculine.
Logs, pieces of bark, bark baskets and bark canoes are also all feminine, because
of their connection with tree trunks. All boats and ships are feminine presumably
because they are placed in the same category as bark canoes. Parts of the body are
of the same gender as their possessor, except for the genital organs, which are
invariably of the opposite gender to the possessor.
      The semantic basis of the human and non-human categories is self-evident,
    except that certain animals which are closely associated with humans come in the
    former category. The animals concerned include palarjamwani, ‘dog’ (and all other
    words meaning ‘dog’), tajamini, ‘dingo’, and muani, ‘goanna . The special association
    of dogs and dingoes with man is obvious, but it is not clear why goannas should
    also be placed in the ‘human’ category.
522.1.2 Formal processes
Nouns do not necessarily have any overt mark of gender, although the class of
nouns is always apparent from concord with adjectives, which are invariably marked.
The means of marking both nouns and adjectives is suffixation, the masculine suffix
being -Ni and the feminine suffix -Ka. -Ni has morphologically conditioned variants
-ni and -ti, and -Ka has morphologically conditioned variants -tja and -ka, but no
explanation can be oflered for the selection of suffixes by any particular stem.
-ni and     are the more common and currently productive pair, and it seems possible
that -ti and -ka are older prefixes which have gradually been superseded. Some
examples are given below.
 Masculine                                     Feminine
 tini           man                            titja             woman
 mantani        male friend                    mantaija          female friend
palarjamwani    male dog                       palatjdmwaka      female dog
pijini          widower                        pijipa            widow
 muani          male goanna                    muaka             female goanna
jikwani         fire                           tdjukwopa         vine

 kilipamijati   young man                      kiluwuka          turtle’s egg
 kilirupati     thin-legged man                pdraka            spider
 Jlatipajti     boy                            milika            rock
 j(apara        moon                           minta             xamia palm
 iapula         camp                           iarikali          wattle tree
 tajtuwali      shark                          iikala            root
   The approximate percentages of nouns with and without class suffixes (based
on a sample of 200 masculine nouns and 200 feminine nouns) are as follows:
               Masculine                                       Feminine
           -ni         54'0                               -rja          54'0
           -ti         17-0                               -ka           24-5
           no suffix 29 0                                 no suffix 21'5
   There are some exceptional instances of masculine nouns with final -ya or -ka
(e.g., malakanipa, ‘young boy’, numwajijaka, ‘barbless spear’) and feminine nouns
with final -ni or -ti (e.g., kamtukuni, ‘ironwood’, pulauti, ‘woman’s breast’).
   No overt mark of any kind is used to distinguish human from non-human nouns
and (with a few exceptions) none is necessary, as the classes are obvious in any case.
Classification on this dimension is shown by concord with the numerals meaning
 two and three . Each of these numerals has a human, a masculine non-human
and a feminine non-human form, as follows:
                human                m. non-human        f. non-human
Iwo            juraja               jiraja               Mtaua
three          juraj[9riina         jiratdrima           laldrima
The class of every noun is known from its concord with these forms, e.g., juram
wawuruwi, two men’, jira.ta lapara, ‘two months’, jiplaja umwja, ‘two days’.","[67, 68]"
"
3.2 Verb phrases
The only type of verb phrase recognised in this description is the Periphrastic verb
phrase. Verb modification was dealt with in the description of sentences and thus
no head-modifier type of verb phrase is set up here.
   Verbal meanings may be expressed in Tiwi either by a bound form (a verb stem),
e.g. ^akupauli ‘go back’, -ajjauaya ‘talk’, -kauawala ‘sing’, or by a free form (a verbal
noun), e.g.joi ‘dance’, ani ‘give’, kutupi ‘jump’. There is no general rule for assigning
one type of expression rather than the other to any particular verbal meaning and
it even happens sometimes that a particular meaning is expressed in both ways,
by a synonymous pair of forms, one bound and one free, e.g. -aija-iaya ‘talk’, and
namara ‘talk’, -akauai ‘give’ and ani ‘give’. Usually, however, a verbal meaning is
expressed in one way or the other, not in both.
   The main difference between these two kinds of verbal form is the way in which
grammatical concepts such as person, tense and mood can be assigned to them.
 In the case of the bound stems, grammatical concepts are combined with the stem
directly by af^ation, but, in the case of the free verbal stems (verbal nouns, as they
are called in this description), direct affixation is not possible, as these forms are
 entirely uninflected, and an auxiliary verb has to be introduced as the means of
carrying the grammatical information. The construction which results from this
 combination of verbal noun and auxiliary verb is called a Periphrastic verb phrase.
   The Periphrastic verb phrase is thus a structure consisting of two functional slots
— Nucleus (filled by a verbal noun) and Auxiliary (filled by an auxiliary verb),
 in that order.
joi       ijadimi      I danced
 dance I-did
'mwauliki   awurjiiijimi     He’s swimming
swim        he-dur-do
namara    piuamaj[iri      They talked to one another
talk      they-did-recip
  There are four auxiliary verb stems-mi, -ma, -pi and -kauimi, (all of which may
be translated ‘do’) — and the verbal nouns fall into four classes according to their
co-occurrence with one or other of the stems. There appears to be no way of
predicting the class of a verbal noun from its form or meaning.
76kwai ^3jimi        I called out
kulalaya ^ajima         I went round
puli i]3jipi    I hit him
jtilamaja tjauakajimi        I painted
   A number of English verbs have been introduced into Tiwi as verbal nouns, and
these all take the auxiliary verb stem -mi.
cry }j3Ami     I cried
go back ijdjimi        I went back
grabim jiimi      He grabbed him
3.3 Relator-axis phrases
A relator-axis phrase consists of a Relator (manifested by a preposition) and an
Axis (manifested by a nominal or nominal phrase), in that order.
kayi makatifja      at the creek
kapi tiijata      to the beach

    There are just two prepositions — kayi (variant form kd) and kapi (variant form
 ijampi), and both of these have an entirely general locative/directional meaning,
 the translation equivalents of both being ‘at’, ‘to’, ‘in’, ‘on’, ‘by’, etc. In order to
 express a more specific locative or directional meaning, it is necessary to use a
 locative adverb such as jila'ju ‘inside’ or kdji'u ‘above’, e.g. jipaputi kdui'u kapi
jutjwjkwa ‘He went up above, to the sky’.
Part Two
           MYTHS
                                  INTRODUCTIONMyths are primitive man’s source of authority for his institutions. He normally
seeks to justify his laws and customs not on the grounds of their utility or rationality
but solely on the grounds of their derivation from the gods and ancestors of the
remote past. The permanence of his institutions is all that stands between him and
chaos and he feels compelled to find some supernatural or semi-supernatural
authority for them. Thus the Tiwi answer to questions about the reasons for their
customs is always ‘Purukupaali made it’ or ‘Maaimpunini made it’.
   Tiwi myths are thus mainly an explanation of the origin of things, and the source
of authority for them. Purukupaali made the funeral ceremonies and taboos con¬
nected with death, Maaimpunini and Tokwampini made the totemic groups and
laws governing marriage, and Purikikini and X^putupuni made the initiation system
and the ceremonies connected with it. Other mythological figures were the
discoverers of fire, hunting, bark canoes, and similar things of importance to the
Tiwi.
   The main story — that of Purukupaali and Japara. — tells how death first came
into the world, through the frailty of the woman Waijai. According to this story,
long ago, when all the animals lived on earth as human beings, there was no
death in the world. The first death was that of Purukupaali’s baby son Tifiani,
brought about through the sin of his wife, Waijai. After that, Purukupaali made
the harsh law of death for all. Japara (the moon), who the Tiwi believe to have
the power of regeneration, offered life for Tifiani, and for us all, but Purukupaali
would not agree. ‘He was a hard man,’ the Tiwi always say. A strong sense of the
transience of human existence is at the centre of Tiwi spiritual experience, and this
is summed up in Purukupaali’s words ""'ijawalajampunammi t]ia majani, taikuwapi
pajlutjwam, karakuwani jinimatakupaulC, (‘We shall all have to follow my son.
Everyone will die. No one will ever come back.’)
   The poignancy and pathos of the Purukupaali story, however, is not the
characteristic mood of the texts, for the Tiwi are a cheerful people and always ready
to find humour in the situations they are describing. The funny side of things is
always ready to come uppermost in their minds — as in the story of Kuaipurani
and IJaaiqa, for example, and in that of Aantogi, the jabiru, who made the sea salt
with her urine.
   What the reader will inevitably fail to appreciate unfortunately, unless he takes
the trouble to obtain copies of the tapes and listen to them in conjunction with the
transcriptions, is the poetry of the Tiwi language. The best example in the collection
is Text 1, the story of Purukupaali and Japara, as told by Foxy Jipanwuti, but
almost any text chosen at random affords ample evidence of the power and diversity
of the language. The translations generally convey little of the effect of the original,
as the semantic complexity of the verb forms is lost in an English paraphrase.
Simple phrases, too, like waijai jimpajliffa purukupauli ijara punajitja, (Waijai the
woman, Purukupaali’s wife), and waija jimukuua ijara mauani kiijini, (His little son
was already dead), have an emotional power derived from familiarity which the
translations regrettably fail to convey. For the reader who wishes to be able to
respond to effects of this kind, merely reading the transcriptions is not enough.
He has to listen to the tapes as well, until the rhythms and cadences of the language
have pervaded his mind.
   The power of myths is founded in their antiquity, in their transmission from
generation to generation, from our grandfathers and great-grandfathers and from
their grandfathers and great-grandfathers before them, from the dawn of time down
to us who are living today. They are an expression of the continuity of life and of
80our bond with the dear, familiar world we were born in, and constitute an affirmation
of our identity as a people. The old Tiwi, who told these stories, were proud men
with a strong sense of their ancient tradition. They respected the white man’s culture
but knew it was not for them. They knew they never could or would turn into black
Europeans. What they felt is best expressed in Allie Miller’s words in his account
of the origin of the kujlama ceremony: mia'tu nua muruntawi tjsninuwila
paulini . . . tjawa'tu tuniwuwi — ijawa tiwi, pawa tiwi — ijawa ka/lu
ijdinatamwaji pdiiiijawila . . . ijawa ka/lu tj^matamwaji pili ijawa kaj'lu
murmtawamaji. ijawa ijinta tiwi, ijawa tuniwuwi. ‘You white people have your
own ancient tradition, and we black people — we Tiwi, we Tiwi — will never give
up our own. We will never give it up because we are not white people. We are Tiwi.
We are black people.’The Informants
The informants were as follows; texts 1 and 14, Foxy Jipanwuti (qawuntipatamiri);
texts 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 and 17, Allie Miller (wuraputuwai); texts 4 and
5, Harry Carpenter (mi^amijau); text 13, Laurie Nelson (tukuliapanila); text 15,
King Larrie (takampuga). At the time when the recordings were made (1967), Allie
Miller and Laurie Nelson were in their fifties. Foxy Xipanwuti over sixty, and
Harry Carpenter and King Larrie both over seventy. Foxy Xipanwuti was the only
Bathurst Islander among them, the rest being from Melville Island. Allie Miller
and Laurie Nelson were brothers, and both died in 1968. Their elder brother. King
Larrie, died in 1971.

3    WORD SI RIXS |•A^^^;RN.S
 'I'iwi word stress is normally fixed on (he penultimate .syllable, rcgardlc.ss of the
 class of the word or its morphological structure, (c.g., 'wi/ja, ’.sea’, 'kapi, ‘at’, ti'tjata,
 ‘beach’, nymara, ‘talk’, tuni'wlni, ‘black’, /j.ij,}nuip'rii>i, ‘I lay down’). If the stem
 is in word-final position stress comes on the penultimate syllabic of (his, but, if
 suHixcs arc added, stress is shiftcti to the right so as to keep it on the penultimate
 syllabic (d the woril (c.g., Jiikyjinii, ‘he ilid it’, Jlik.uyniani, ‘he kept on doing it’,
jiik.UiVnynumi, ‘he kept on moving about and doing i(’). In this way strc.ss functions
 as a means of locating word bouiularics in the stream of speech, as it is usually
 sale to assume that there is a word boundary after (he syllabic following the stress.
  It also means, of course, that there is normally no means of distinguishing
 phoncmically identical worils by a ilill'erence in (he location of stress. I'hcrc arc,
 in fact, a number of stems which have stress on the fund syllable, but these only
 amount to about three per cent of the total number of stems in (he lexicon and
 include a number of loan words fiY)m .liwadja (a language of the adjacent mainland).
                                                                                       21  The word stress pattern consists of an optional Prelude and an obligatory
Nucleus, in that order, the Prelude being one or more stress groups each having
a secondary stress as its nucleus, and the Nucleus being a single stress group having
a primary stress as its nucleus;
                                word stress pattern = (P)N

   The stress groups are of two basic types — a predominant type, A, having an
unstressed syllable following the stress and functioning as a closure (e.g., each of
the stress groups in idtjkdnd^ki, ‘sea eagle’, thmukdka, ‘floating tree’, mdkathja,
‘fresh water creek’), and a minority type B, having no such final unstressed syllable
(e.g., the final stress groups of dwuriawi, ‘mother of a male child’, jdrdrmju, ‘wedge-
tailed eagle’, ijhamuhki, ‘I’m full up’). Ninety-seven per cent of the primary stress
groups in the lexicon are of type A and only three per cent of type B. There are
no secondary stress groups of type B. Either type may have one or more unstressed
syllables preceding the stress and functioning as an onset (e.g., kamma, ‘dance
movement’, msjdka, ‘throat’, kuku, ‘yam’), but stress groups with an onset do not
occur word-initially except when the word consists of only one stress group. The
closure of a non-final type A stress group may contain two unstressed syllables
(e.g., ij3ntdJ9-kdjmi, ‘we did it’, pujdka-mu, ‘they sat down’), but a stress group
occurring in word-final position may not have more than one unstressed syllable
in its closure, with the single exception of mwdjliki, ‘swim’, which is the only word
in the language to have two unstressed syllables following primary stress. In longer
words, where there are two or more unstressed syllables between stresses, it is often
impossible to decide to which stress group these belong, but perhaps the decision
is unnecessary in any case, as the stress groups are really wave-like motions and
there is thus little point in trying to find boundaries between them.
   The location of primary stress is generally predictable by the rule ‘occurs on
the penultimate syllable of the word’, and, where it occurs elsewhere, its location
can be easily indicated by the use of a stress mark. The location of secondary stress
is a more difficult matter, however, except in words having no more than three
syllables preceding primary stress. In these words the location of secondary stress
can always be predicted as the word-initial syllable is always stressed (except in
words having only one syllable preceding primary stress) and as no two consecutive
syllables may be stressed. These rules allow only the types '(-),             '-^(■""). and
'—e.g., Jluma, ‘basket’, kukuni, ‘water’, dwurmi, ‘man’, miirukupwdm, ‘girl’.
In longer verb forms, containing one or more incorporated items, the secondary
stresses cannot be located without the use of morphological information, as the
general principle is that each stem has a stress on its penultimate syllable. For
example, in li-ni-pa-kapi-w’ammi-amamipa, ‘she came over for some cooked oysters’,
each of the stresses after the word-initial stress is located on the penultimate syllable
of an incorporated stem. To pronounce these long verb forms with the correct
stress pattern, therefore, one has to remember the following rules: (a) primary
stress is on the penultimate syllable of the word (except where otherwise marked);
(b) the first syllable of the word always has the first secondary stress; (c) other
secondary stresses occur on the penultimate .syllable of each incorporated stem.
Chapter Two
                              MORPHOPHONOLOGYThe morphophonology consists of three main sections — general processes, verb
morphophonology and nominal morphophonology, in that order — and two short
sections on enclitics and word sandhi. The verb morphophonology and nominal
morphophonology treat morpheme classes in their order of occurrence from left
to right, beginning with the first order of prefixes and ending with the last order
of suffixes, and give a full description of the variation in the form of every morpheme
of each class.
    Every morpheme has a postulated underlying morphophonological representation
and one or more phonemic representations generated by morphophonological
processes. Processes which are not restricted to a particular morpheme class but
are conditioned solely by phonological factors are described in the opening section
on general processes. The verb morphophonology is rather complex (because of
the complexity of verb morphology) but the nominal morphophonology is quite
simple because of the small number of affixes involved.
    The majority of the morphologically restricted processes also have some kind
of phonological motivation, and, in most cases, this is to overcome the difficulty
of combining morpheme-final vowel with morpheme-initial vowel, but other types
of phonological motivation are also apparent — e.g., consonantal dissimilation and
avoidance of excessive length. The processes used are of all possible formal types,
including insertion, deletion, replacement, permutation, and various combinations
 of these, and a variety of different processes may be used for the same phonological
 purpose. For example, V -I- V combination, which is very common in verb morphology,
 may be dealt with (a) by merely running the two vowels together (so that they sound
 like a single long vowel); (b) by linking them with an intervocalic glide, y or w;
 (c) by inserting a consonant (any one of several, depending on the morphemes
 concerned) between the two vowels; (d) by deletion of morpheme-final vowel;
 (e) by deletion of morpheme-initial vowel; (f) by metathesis, and (g) by some
 combination of vowel deletion and consonant insertion. This no doubt seems a
 rather bewildering array of formal processes to deal with a single problem of com¬
 bination but the variety is not entirely pointless. For example, deletion of final
 vowel is mainly restricted to morphemes of more than one syllable, as, if it were
 generally applied to monosyllabic morphemes, the effect would be to reduce them
 to a single phoneme and this would make them more difficult to identify. The variety
 of processes, moreover, has the value of distinguishing different morpheme classes,
 as each class has its distinctive type of morphophonological change.","[36, 37, 38]"

1 The text is a description of a big final dance (jiloti). These are started in the late
   morning, at about ten or eleven o’clock. The informant pointed to a place fairly
   high in the sky to indicate the position of the sun. The small dances (jilamya)
   are usually held in the evening. The big dances would start in the morning and
   finish at about mid-day on the following day.
2 A wooden comb-like instrument is used in painting to put on rows of dots.
3 The participants spend two or three hours before the dance in being painted up,
   not only the face but the whole body. They do not paint themselves but sit still
   while someone else paints them. At a big dance elaborate patterns of red and
   yellow are painted all over the face and body.
4 The items listed are all ceremonial objects used at funeral dances.
5 The painting up is done at some distance from the dancing place. When the
   painting is finished everyone moves off towards the dancing place.
6 A small fire of green twigs and leaves is made not far from the grave. This gives
   off a great deal of smoke and is intended to confuse the spirit, preventing it from
   recognising the dancers by their smell. Everyone dances round the fire and through
   the smoke.
7 The head man tells another man he is to dance by himself.
 8 The song was one composed and sung by the informant (Allie Miller) at the
   funeral ceremony for his son, a short time before he recorded the text.
1149 They now leave the dancing place and move off towards the grave, a few yards
  away.
  They all creep up quietly towards the grave. When they are close enough, there
  is a great shout of ‘Oau!’, they all throw their spears, run forward, and hurl
  themselves onto the grave. The purpose of the whole procedure is presumably
  to drive away evil spirits.
i^The crying is a highly conventionalised crying and wailing. The principal
   mourners pretend to be about to hit themselves with bottles and tins, and have
   to be restrained in case they do themselves some harm.
12 They start clapping their buttocks with their hands to provide the rhythmic beat
   for dancing.
1^ The chief mourner has to pay the ‘workers’ who made the grave posts and assisted
   at the burial. In former times payment used to be in the form of spears and other
   artifacts, but these days payment is in cash, hundreds of dollars changing hands
   at a big ceremony.
1'^ He dances round the circle, finishing in front of the ‘worker’, but facing away
    from him. He then bends down and passes the belt or other object to him
    between his legs.
15 Each worker shouts ‘Ail’ as he receives his payment.
16 The final stage of the ceremony is when the grave posts are taken and stood in
   the ground round the grave.
12 When the posts are stood up, the five men who made the posts dance by themselves.
Part Three
             DICTIONARY
t
                                 INTRODUCTIONThe dictionary consists of Tiwi-English and English-Tiwi alphabetical lists and a
short thesaurus (a semantic classification of the nouns). Alphabetical lists, although
necessary for the purpose of reference, convey nothing of the range or structure of
a people’s experience, and the thesaurus has been added in the hope of remedying
this deficiency. It should give the reader at least some idea of the kind of world the
Tiwi live in, and of the way in which they see themselves and organise their lives.
   The writer’s aim throughout was to present the vocabulary as far as possible as it
was before extensive culture contact began, by the exclusion of almost all the foreign
words which are used by the Tiwi today. Tiwi knowledge of the outside world dates
mainly from about 1900, and, since that time, a great many new words have been
acquired to deal with this new body of experience. Some of these new words are loan
words acquired either from English or from Jiwadja (the mainland tribe through
whom Tiwi knowledge of the outside world was initially acquired), and others are
new formations derived by existing processes from native Tiwi elements. Some English
loan words, for example, are pmuki ‘smoke’, tilipi ‘tea leaf’, Jlukwa ‘sugar’, Jlinikini
‘sneak up’, paki ‘tobacco’, pwajiki ‘swag’, mariti ‘married’, and waki ‘work’. Some
words from Jiwadja are kapala ‘boat’, palijara ‘mast’, pmpala ‘sail’, kuli ‘rudder’,
iipi'lu ‘playing cards’, p'/w ‘matches’, kurampali ‘house’, kupli ‘door’ and walimani
‘steel axe’. (Some of these Jiwadja loan words were in turn borrowed by the Jiwadja
from the Macassans in the nineteenth century — e.g. pra ‘paper’, from Malay or
 Macassarese surat, and pmpala ‘sail’, from Macassarese sampala.) Some examples of
words newly formed from native Tiwi elements are ajikatBraputai ‘cross’, ampajakitikimi
‘trigger’, apaputi ‘steps’, papupkarimia ‘looking glass’, papapukia ‘hair oil’,
papanipimapapa ‘cup’, and papupkariparaja ‘towel’. Altogether, there must be
 hundreds of such culture contact words in the current vocabulary but, apart from a
few very common ones, these were excluded from the present dictionary for the reason
stated above.
   The vocabulary is naturally very small compared with that of any European
language owing to the far greater range of demands made on the latter. Obviously
a language which is used by a very large number of people for a very wide variety of
purposes is bound to have many more words than one which is used by a tiny group
 of people for a very limited range of purposes. English, for example, has a vast number
of literary, learned, technical and scientific terms, and Tiwi naturally has nothing
corresponding to these. The 2000 or so words collected in the present dictionary
undoubtedly represent a substantial part of the Tiwi vocabulary, as is easy to tell
from the difficulty of collecting more. However, it should be stressed that the everyday
vocabulary of the average speaker of English is probably no larger than that of the
 average speaker of Tiwi. The English speaker has access to a very much larger
vocabulary but he does not generally make much use of it.
   The most obvious general characteristic of the vocabulary is its concreteness. To
 take some examples at random, there are no Tiwi equivalents to abstract nouns such
 as ‘size’, ‘shape’, ‘texture’, ‘colour’, ‘quality’, ‘quantity], or to generic terms such as
 ‘animal’, ‘mammal’, ‘marsupial’, ‘vegetable’, ‘plant’, ‘limb’, ‘organ’. Although there
 are names for many species of birds, reptiles and shellfish, there arc no generic terms
 meaning ‘bird’, ‘reptile’ or ‘shellfish’, and, although there arc narnes for a variety of
 weapons, tools and implements, there are no generic terms meaning ‘weapon], ‘tool’
 or ‘implement’. Also, there are no general colour words other than two which can
 be loosely translated ‘black’ and ‘white’, but these refer to the dark-light dimension
 of contrast, not to the colour spectrum.
    Perhaps it should be added, in ca.se any reader should draw wrong conclusions
 from the foregoing remarks, that the small size and concreteness of the Tiwi vocabulary
 should not be taken as evidence of the general primitiveness of the language. Tiwi
 grammar is so far from primitive, in fact, that it took the writer several years to unravel
118its intricacies. The verb morphology and morphophonology, in particular, is a device
of incredible cornplexity and sophistication which can be used to express a wide range
of subtle distinctions with great precision and economy. The reader who has mistaken
notions about ‘primitive’ languages has to be told that he could never, by any con¬
ceivable expenditure of time and intellectual effort, attain the degree of fluency in
the use of this device which is possessed by the older Tiwi. The subtlety and precision
of their thought, as exhibited in their use of this very complex system of rules, is equal
to anything found in European languages.
     Another interesting feature of the vocabulary to which the reader’s attention should
 be drawn is its provision of two, three, or sometimes even four names for most of
 the more important things in the Tiwi world. For example, ‘crocodile’ is jaraykspai,
jaratjkapijluni, tajuni or takampurja (with no distinction of meaning), ‘dog’ is
palaijamwani, katariijani, waijkini or pamulampur^ini, and ‘barbed spear’ is ajawunipkui,
 tilipajiya or toyontilau. This proliferation of synonyms is not a luxury, as in English,
 but a necessity arising from the Tiwi practice of placing a taboo on not only the names
 of dead people, ljut also on all common nouns or other words which resemble these
 names phonologically. In most cases one of the names of a thing has favourite status,
 but, if this becomes taboo, the existence of synonyms means that another name is
 always available to take its place.","[129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134]"
"The order of verb and object
In the transitive verbal sentence the normal order of verb and object is ’VO.
S          V               O
ajikulani juuj(iara        ijaruwani         The old man told his brother
 S              V          O
jimpajlina      tiimaru'ji puni^kapa              The woman took the meat
This order may be reversed, however, provided S is either deleted, pronominalised
or moved to sentence-final position.
O            V
kukuni       pujdmapapa          They drank the water
Spn      O          V
wuta     kukuni     pujdmapapa             They drank the water
O            V               s
kukuni       pujamarjapa     kakuijluwi        The children drank the water
Sp„      O          V                  S
wuta     kukuni pujamaijapa            kakuijluwi        The children drank the water
  At this point it may be useful to summarise the combinations of S, V and O
permitted by the bracketing rules and constraints on inversion. These are: SVO,
VOS, OVS, SV, VO, OV, VS, V. The combinations excluded are SOV, VSO and OSV.
No doubt occasional instances of each of these might be found, but their probability
of occurrence and level of acceptability are very low. SO, OS, S and O are also
excluded, of course, as these are regarded as only fragments of sentences. Examples
of the permitted sequences are given below.
SVO          j3r3kati jiik3jimi       mampurja               Jarakati made canoes
VOS          jiik3jimimampurja j3r3kati                      Jarakati made canoes
OVS          mampurja jiik3jimi j'3r3kati                     Jarakati made canoes
SV           j3r3kati jiik3jimi                              Jarakati made them
VO           jiik3jimi    mampurja                            He made canoes
             mampurja jiik3jimi                               He made canoes
VS           j'iik3jirm j'3r3kati                             Jarakati made them
V            jiik3Jimi                                        He made them
   An alternative method of expressing object in surface structure is its incorporation
within the verb as a bound nominal stem, immediately preceding the verb stem,
e.g. ijd-J3-mari-ijiliwat}Ji3ij-u'ji ‘I took the wallaby’ (I-lk-with-wallaby-go),
a-wur}iiij3-mari-panir}3- mu ‘He’s got some meat’ (he-dur-with-meat-sit). Incor¬
poration has its limitations, however, as the number of forms which can be incor¬
porated in the object slot is quite limited, and, apart from those referring to parts
 64of the body, tend to be generic rather than specific in meaning. For example, there is
an incorporated form for ‘fish’ in general, one for ‘bird’ in general, one for ‘shellfish’
in general, and so on, but none referring to particular species of fish, birds or shellfish.
For this reason, it is usual not to incorporate an object until specific reference to
it has been made liy a free nominal. For example, a sentence like li-i-mari-kBidmauip-
u'ji ‘She took the cooked bird’, would almost certainly be preceded by a sentence
containing specific reference to the bird, e.g. aunaijka lu-wurjld-raum-ani, jli-i-mari-
k^Tpmajip-u'ji ‘She was cooking a goose, then she took the cooked bird away’.
(See Morphology 1.2 for a full account of the incorporation of stems into the verb.)
  The expression of structural relations
  It is commonly believed that structural identification of subject and object is achieved
 either by case inflexion or by fixed word order, and that therefore languages which
  are without one must have the other. Tiwi, however (like many other Australian
  languages), has neither case inflexion nor fixed word order, and yet manages to avoid
  structural ambiguity, and it is thus a matter of some interest to observe how this
  is achieved. SVO and OVS both occur. How are they distinguished?
     The means which are used are as follows: (1) normality of order, (2) phonological
 signals, (3) concord, (4) seicctional restrictions, (5) knowledge of the cultural/situational
 context.
     As already stated, Tiwi word order although not fixed is not entirely free. Every
 structure has a normal order, and departures from this are governed by bracketing
 rules and other constraints. SVO is a normal order and OVS an inverted one, and,
 for this reason, given no other structural cues of any kind, a native speaker of Tiwi
 will interpret a sentence such as jardkati juutjai kuuupurani as ‘Jarakati found
 Kujupurani’ not ‘Kujupurani found Jarakati’. When any danger of structural
 ambiguity arises the normal order is always reverted to in order to avoid this.
     Phonological signals, too, play an important part in the interpretation of sentence
 structure, principally as an indication of inversion. When the order of subject and
 predicate is reversed, a distinct pause may occur following the predicate phrase,
 signalling that the predicate ends at this point and that the subject is only added for
 amplification. For example, in a sentence such as kujupurani juu^ai, jarakati ‘Jarakati
 found Kujupurani’, the pause after the predicate phrase signals the bracketing,
 showing kujupurani to be object and jarakati subject.
     Concord between the verb and the nominals related to it as subject and object
 is another of the main means of signalling structure. As verbs include information
about the person, number and gender of both subject and object, subject and object
 nominals which differ in any one of these respects can be easily distinguished. For
example, in the sentence waijai iuutjai lapara ‘Japara found Waijai’, Waijai (the
woman) is identified as object, no matter in what order the words are arranged, by
the initial prefix on the verb, /«-, which indicates third-person singular subject acting
on third-person singular feminine object. Concord is thus a sufficient means of
distinguishing subject and object, even without the assistance of order and phonology,
except, of course, when subject and object arc of the same person, number and
gender.
    Selectional restrictions on the choice of nominals as subject and object also play
a great part, especially a severe restriction on the use of inanimate nominals as
subject of a transitive sentence. For example, the sentence jikwani juurjau purikikini
‘Purikikini threw fire’, can only be interpreted in one way, no matter in what order
the words are arranged, because the interpretation ‘Fire threw Purikikini’ is
semantically deviant, and precluded by selectional restrictions.
    Finally, knowledge of the cultural/situational context is of the greatest importance
in the structural interpretation of sentences, and would, in fact, often be sufficient
for interpreting them even if all other means were absent. Take for instance the
inverted sentence lapara jipuijipa purukupajli ‘Purukupaali hit J^P^ra in the eye’.
In this case order, concord and selectional restrictions all fail to distinguish subject
and object (as the order is inverted and the two nominals have the same person.
                                                                                       65 number and gender, and are both human and animate), and let us suppose that
 phonological signals of structure are also absent (as they might be). Disambiguation
 is still achieved through knowledge of the cultural context, as all Tiwi are familiar
 with the story of Purukupajli and Japara, and thus know in advance who hit who
 in the eye.","[79, 80, 81]"
"1.2 Deletion and pronominalisation
Both subject and object may be deleted in surface structure, independently of one
another, and the deletion of either is virtually obligatory when it is supplied by the
linguistic or extra-linguistic context — for example in a non-initial sentence in a
sequence of sentences having the same referent as subject or object in deep structure,
or in a situation in which identification of the subject is achieved by pointing or
looking at the referent.
                              SP ^ P             VO -> V
s      V          O
jama   jiikipa    kwoka       Jsjua cracked xamia nuts
       V          O
       jiikipa    kwoka       She cracked xamia nuts
S      V
jama   jiikipa                Ja-iua cracked them
        V
       jiikipa                She cracked them
   Provided lexical identification is provided by the context, both subject and object
may be pronominalised — that is, a pronoun expressing the grammatical concepts
abstracted from it may be substituted for it and fill its syntactic function. Subject
is pronominalised much more readily than object, and, while subject may be either
a personal pronoun or a demonstrative, pronoun object is nearly always a demon¬
strative.
S       V         O
mutati jiikdjimi jikwani        Mutati made fire
S      V        O
ijara jUkauimi jikwani        He made fire
S      V              o
mutati JiikdAimi      awara     Mutati made it
S      V           O
ijara jiikajimi    awara      He made it
   The use of a pronoun substitute for a deleted subject or object is optional, however,
as every verb in any case incorporates obligatory pronominal reference to subject
and every transitive verb also incorporates obligatory pronominal reference to
object. For example, the verb jipampuna means ‘He followed him’ and is a sentence
by itself. Nothing is added to the meaning of the sentence by the use of separate
pronouns, as in ijara Jipampuna awara ‘He followed him’. The Tiwi do in fact often
use separate pronouns for subject and object, but their use is quite superfluous from
the point of view of syntax, and, as a matter of style, they tend to be avoided in
sentences in which the verb is rather long.
   Even in non-verbal sentences (which have no pronominal reference to the subject
within the predicate phrase) the use of a pronoun substitute for a deleted third-
person subject is not obligatory, as the subject can usually be inferred from the
context. For example, ‘He’s dead’ may be either tjara pajutjwani or just paju^wani
‘dead’, and ‘It’s good’ is just pumpuni ‘good’, ‘It’s bad’ just Jluti ‘bad’, and so on.
In the possessive type of non-verbal sentence, however, pronominal substitution for
a deleted subject is necessary, e.g. ijara Jiijajti ‘He (has) a lot’ as contrasted with
Ji^ajti ‘(There is) a lot’.
 62 1.3 Ordering
Word order is generally very flexible in Australian languages owing to their greater
dependence on alternative means of expressing syntactic relations — especially
concord and context — and Tiwi is typical in this respect. But, although flexible
to some extent, Tiwi word order is still far from being entirely free. Order is not
fixed, but there are norms, and rules governing departure from these norms.
Variations of order are permitted, but only on a principled basis, not just as a matter
of indifference.","[77, 78]"
"                                             NOTES
1. Treatment of alveo-palatal sounds
It should be noted here, with regard to the apparent absence in Tiwi of the series
usually labelled ‘alveo-palatal’ or ‘palatal’ in descriptions of Australian languages,
that the Tiwi ‘dental’ series is in fact the same series differently labelled. As already
mentioned, Tiwi is one of the many Australian languages in which dental and alveo-
palatal sounds are merged as members of a single phoneme. In this situation, many
linguists have chosen to identify the phoneme by its alveo-palatal member, and this
may have been the correct thing to do given the data they were describing, but, in
the case of Tiwi at least, the data suggests that the apico-dental member of the
phoneme is its basic form.
2. Treatment of retroflex sounds
Although retroflex sounds [^], [//] and [/] all occur very commonly in Tiwi no evidence
could be found which would require the setting up of a retroflex series of phonemes,
distinct from the alveolar series. The retroflex sounds never occur initially in words
or utterances. In the intervocalic positions in which they do occur it is always possible
to postulate that the retroflexion is due to the presence of an immediately preceding
/j/, and this is in fact what has been done in the present description, jut is established
by independent evidence and, as ///, jtij, and ///, (if these phonemes were set up)
would never be distinguishable from /.///, Imj, lulj, a separate retroflex series seems
redundant.
   Even more compelling is the following evidence. There are a great many masculine
nominal forms such as [mi'ali], ‘pandanus’, ['mwali], ‘son’, [jiati'tjali], ‘boy’ in which
the masculine suffix -ti has an initial retroflex stop instead of the usual alveolar stop.
This fact seems an inexplicable anomaly until one considers the corresponding
feminine forms, which are [mia'ji^a], [mwa'ji^a], and [latiija'Jirja]. What these feminine
forms prove is that a morpheme boundary occurs following the retroflexion and
preceding the stop. A separate /.// phoneme is shown to be present in the masculine
forms and the retroflexion of the stop is thus shown to be merely a conditioned
feature.
3. The velar fricative
The one unusual feature of the Tiwi consonant system is its possession of a single
fricative phoneme — the voiced velar fricative, /y/ — as friction is generally not
 used as a distinctive feature in Australian languages. Tiwi may not be alone, however,
in its possession of this phoneme, as the same sound appears to have been observed
in some other north Australian languages (Jiwadja and Maung; see Capell 1962:
 129). The phoneme remains an isolated, unintegrated oddity in the system, however,
as there is not the slightest indication in Tiwi of the development of a systematic
stop-fricative contrast. Moreover, the very low incidence of jyj, and the restrictions
on its occurrence — it can occur only in intervocalic position — both tend to suggest
that the phoneme is a relative innovation, which may have arisen either as a result
of outside influence or by a phonemic split from jwj, and which has not yet estab¬
lished itself as an equal member of the system.
   In articulatory terms /y/ is somewhat similar to jwj, as the place of articulation
is the same for both and as the rounding of the latter is generally rather slight. Both
                                                                                               11sounds are pronounced with the back of the tongue raised towards the soft palate
but the height of the tongue is slightly greater for /y/, producing a very narrow aper¬
ture which results in audible local friction. Unusual as it is (for an Australian
language) the contrast is not in doubt, as the two sounds occur in exactly the same
phonological environment, and one cannot be freely substituted for the other.
4. The glottal stop
Another possibility which had to be considered in the course of analysis was that
of setting up a glottal stop phoneme, as the glottal stop does in fact occur in Tiwi
and it would not be correct to say that it was without linguistic function. It has a
function, certainly, but, as this function depends on syntagmatic rather than para¬
digmatic relations, it is not of a kind that can easily be accommodated within the
framework of a phonemic description. The significance of the glottal stop in Tiwi
depends on the restriction of its occurrence to sentence-final position. It signals the
end of sentences, in fact, but, as it does this not by contrastively replacing something
else but merely by being kept in a constant position relative to the sentence, its
significance is of the kind that is best handled by prosodic theory rather than of the
kind which has traditionally been dealt with by phonemics.","[26, 27]"
"3.1.2 Attribution
The deep structural relation of ‘quality’ concepts to ‘thing’ concepts finds expression
in syntax through either of two processes — predication and attribution. That is,
a quality may be either predicated of a thing (e.g. murukupwaua pumpuka ‘The girl
(is) nice’), or attributed to it {pumpuka murukupwaja ‘a nice girl’). The two con¬
structions are transformationally related, going back to a common thing-quality
relationship in deep structure, and are distinguished in surface structure solely by
the different orders of the constituents.
   In surface structure a noun and its attribute are brought together in a head-
modifier construction, which is signalled by means of class (noun and adjective),
juxtaposition (nothing can be interposed between the constituents), order (modifier
preceding head), concord (modifiers agree in number and gender with the head),
and intonation (a single phrase contour extends over the construction).
auikulani prakapai        a big crocodile
big       crocodile
piija mampuija           a bad canoe
 bad     canoe
    The modifiers in this construction are of three kinds — demonstratives, quantifiers
(i.e. numerals and quantity adjectives) and qualifiers, each class filling a slot to the
left of the head, in the order demonstrative + quantifier -t- qualifier + head. Each
 of the slots is optional and each may occur independently of the others.
pumpuwi palapamwawi              good dogs
juraua palaijamwawi            two dogs
 kapinatjki palaijamwawi         these dogs
juraua pumpuwi palaijamwawi              two good dogs
 kapinaijki pumpuwi palaijamwawi             these good dogs
 kapinayki juraua palaijamwawi             these two dogs
 kapinaijki juraua pumpuwi palaijamwawi             these two good dogs
    Attribution is not a highly developed process in Tiwi —nor probably in any
 Australian language. There is no potential for generating elaborate strings of
 adjectives, and even the limited potential which does exist is used very sparingly.
 The tendency is to use adjectives predicatively rather than attributively. For example,
 ijauapiuni mauini. tuniwini ‘I killed a possum. (It was) a black one’, might very well
 be preferred to ijauapiuni tuniwini mauini ‘I killed a black possum’.",[89]
"1.1.4 Direct object
Person and number of direct object (other than third-person-singular) are expressed
by means of the set of prefixes listed below:
                                 1    .
                                      m3m-    me
                                      m3ni-   you sg
                     Singular
                                      —       him, her
                                 4. mani-     you sg and me                                    1.    m3W3ni- us ex
                                    2.    mani-   you pi
                        Plural
                                    3.    W3ni-   them
                                    4.    mani-   us inc
  For example,
                     ji-m3ni-pUm            He hit me
                     ji-m3t^i-puni          He hit you sg
                     ji-i-puni              He hit him
                     ji-mani-puni           He hit you sg and me
                     ji-m3W3ni-puni         He hit us ex
                     ji-mani-pimi           He hit you pi
                     ji-w3ni-puni           He hit them
                     ji-mani-pimi           He hit us inc
   The homonymous forms are disambiguated by the context (either linguistic or
extra-linguistic), mani-, ‘you sg and me’, being related in deep structure to the personal
pronoun mua, mani-, ‘you pi’, to nua, and mani-, ‘us inc’, to ijaya. The i- \nji-i-pimi,
‘He hit him’, is not an object prefix but merely a meaningless segment introduced
by the morphophonology (see Morphophonology, 2.2).
   Third-person-singular direct object is inferred from the absence of a prefix, and
gender of such an object (except when it co-occurs with third-person-singular subject
in past tense verbs) is expressed by means of the tense marker p3- or t3-, depending
on the tense of the verb. These two morphemes have multiple function. They always
signal tense but they are also used wherever necessary to signal gender of object
or gender of subject. In transitive verbs with third-person-singular direct object
(other than past tense verbs which also have third-person-singular subject) either
p3- or t3- is inserted to express feminine gender of object. The absence of p3- or
t3- in such a verb indicates masculine object:
f}3m-p3-J3-pimi       I’ll hit her
^3n-t3-J3-pimi        I hit her
ij3-j3-puni           I’ll hit him or I hit him
40   In past tense verbs, when third-person-singular direct object co-occurs with third-
person-singular subject, the subject prefixes ji- and ti- are used to express gender
of object, and gender of subject is neutralised. That is, these two prefixes are still
third-person-singular subject prefixes, but the gender meaning which they also
carry is transferred from subject to object:
ji-i-puni     He hit him or She hit him
 Jli-i-puni   He hit her or She hit her1.1.5 Indirect object
Person, number and gender of indirect object are expressed by means of the set
of prefixes listed below.
                                 1. ma-          me
                                 2. manp-        you sg
                     Singular
                                 3. ma-          him
                                      mara-      her
                                 4. mch          you sg and me                                      1.    mapa-      us ex
                                      2.    maka-      you pi
                     Plural
                                      3.    japa-      them
                                      4.    ma-        us inc
   The indirect object prefixes express an oblique case relationship — e.g., ‘for me’,
‘to me’, ‘with me’ — the exact meaning being defined by the context. The most
common use is benefactive:
a-md-kdjimi                  He’ll do it for me
a-manp-kauimi                He’ll do it for you sg
a-ma-kajimi                  He’ll do it for him
a-mara-kajimi                He’ll do it for her
a-ma-kajimi                  He’ll do it for you sg and me
a-mapa-kauimi                He’ll do it for us ex
a-maka-kauimi                He’ll do it for you pi
a-japa-kauimi                He’ll do it for them
a-ma-kauimi                  He’ll do it for us inc
                                           NOTES
1. Verbs meaning ‘give’ (stems -akauai and -ilud) have direct object prefixes as
the translation equivalent of English indirect object, e.g., pu-ra-mawan-takauai,
‘They gave it to us (ex)’, ji-wan-tilua, ‘He gave it to them’.
2. Verbs meaning ‘spear’ have indirect object prefixes as the translation equivalent
of English direct object, e.g., am-pu-rjapa-kapuji, ‘He’s going to spear us (ex)’.
3. The stem -kuja, ‘to die’, takes indirect object prefixes as the translation equivalent
of English subject, e.g., ti-ma-kuua, ‘He died’, p-mara-kuua, ‘She died’, ti-uapa-kuja,
‘They died’.","[55, 56]"
"2.3 Stems
Tiwi verbs have as their nucleus a unit called a theme which may consist simply of
a verb stem or of a verb stem preceded by one or more incorporated stems. (See
Morphology, 1.2 for a description of theme structures.) The morphophonology of
verb stems and of incorporated stems may be described by a single set of state¬
ments as there is no difference between them. Both verb stems and incorporated
stems fall into three classes — I, Ila and Ilb — according to their initial phoneme.
Class I stems are those which have an initial consonant, not only in all their phonemic
representations, but also in their underlying morphophonological representation
(e.g., -kajimi, ‘do’, -puni, ‘hit’). Class Ila stems are those which have an initial vowel
in their morphophonological representation and also in all their phonemic rep¬
resentations, except in certain cases where a w has to be inserted or the initial vowel
deleted (e.g., -apa, ‘eat’, -u'ji, ‘go’). Class lib stems are those which, although they
have an initial vowel in their morphophonological representation, take an initial
consonant (p, t, or r) in most of their occurrences, depending on the morphological
environment (e.g., -akupauli, ‘go back’, -inti, ‘stand’).
   Stems may occur in any one of three positions: (a) theme-initial position;
(b) preceded by the prefix mari-', (c) preceded by another stem. In the description
that follows the three positions are treated separately and in the order given. The
morphophonology of stem-suffix combination is treated in section 2.4 following.
2.3.1 Theme-initial position
Stems with initial consonant (Class I stems) undergo no initial change in theme-
initial or in any other position but determine ja- insertion under the conditions
described in 2.2:
                                                                                       31T)3-   + miiniija- + -utja             ^3-J3-munifja-tja
I           fight          grab        I grabbed him as he was fighting
   lla stems undergo no initial change except when preceded by the future-imperative
prefix Ca-, and are w combining as explained in 1.1:
fj3- + alipi- -I- -atjkina    iju-alipi-arjkma
I        meat     steal       1 steal the meat
lla stems with initial close vowel lose this vowel following Ca-:
Ca- 4- -utiara -> ta-tiara
imp       tell        Tell him!
(An exception is -u'ui, ‘go’, which combines with Ca- by means of metathesis, e.g.,
Ca- + -u'ji        tu-a'ji, ‘Go!’.) Ila stems with initial a, however, retain this vowel
under all circumstances and combine with a preceding a without any glide, deletion,
or insertion:
Ca- + -apa -> ta-apa
imp       eat      Eat!
   Ilb stems in theme-initial position take an initial consonant {p, t, or r) except
when the preceding prefix is Ca-, ‘future-imperative’, or ka-, ‘evening’. The initial
consonant is p except following ma-, ‘subjunctive’, an object prefix,          ‘durative’,
tjd-, ‘half way’, or raja-, ‘walking along’:
p3- + -inti       rja-pinti
I        stand    I stand
r}3- + ra- -H apujitja-           4-   -mu    ya-ra-pupupjliya-'mu
1      p      talk                     sit   I sat talking
Initial t follows ma- or an object prefix:
)ja- 4- ma- 4- -inti -> pa-ma-tinti
I        sb       stand   I might stand
ji- 4- mani-             -amputfa -> ji-man-tampuna
 he    me                follow       He followed me
Initial r follows ujipa-, ‘durative’, tja-, ‘half way’, and raja-, ‘walking’:
a- + ujitja- 4- -inti      a-unja-rinti
he      dur       stand    He’s standing
a- 4- ujitja- 4- apujifja- 4- -'mu              a-unja-rapunjlitja-'mu
he    dur        talk         sit               He’s sitting talking
Where an initial consonant is not inserted (i.e., following Ca-, ‘future-imperative’,
or ka-, ‘evening’), the general process of j combination is operative (see 1.1 for a
description of this process):
pa- 4- ka- 4- -inti -> pa-ua-ki-inti
I       eve     stand    I stand in the evening
Ca- 4- -akupauli -> ta-jakupauli
imp    go back      Go back!
An alternative method of combination with the imperative prefix is deletion of
stem-initial vowel (e.g., ta-kupauli, ‘Go back!’) but this method cannot apply to
bisyllabic stems like -inti, ‘stand’.2.3.2 mari- -f stem
mari- loses its final vowel in combining with a Ila stem but the stem undergoes no
change:
pa- 4- mari- 4- alipi- 4- -mu -> pa-ua-mar-alipi- mu
I       with       meat     sit     I sat with the meat
pa-    4-   mari-   4-   atapa- 4- -u'ui      pa-ja-mar-atapu-'ji
I           with         kwoka     go         I took the kwoka
32The Ha stem draami-, ‘bundle of spears’, has to combine with mari- by the process
usually reserved for lib stems as there is a general prohibition on the sequence
rar. When mari- precedes a Ilb stem the final syllable of the prefix is deleted and the
stem takes initial j(:
IJ3- + mari- + iliijanta- + -u'.ii    fja-jd-ma-lilujanta-'ui
I      with       basket     go       I took the basket
//a- + mari- + -amamipa         ija-ud-ma-lamaunipa
I      with    get up           I took it2.3.3 Stem + stem
Ha stems (except for Ha stems with initial a) have their initial vowel deleted when
preceded by another stem:
}]3- + malamuniija- + -wja     ijd-ja-ma^amuniija-ija
1      work            grab    I grabbed him as he was working
Ha stems with initial a retain this initial vowel when preceded by another stem,
and the LH stem has its final vowel deleted:
ijd- + ra- + dmdnapi- + -apa -> ija-ra-pumanaij-apa
I      p     get up        eat      I ate before getting up
Ilb stems combine with a preceding incorporated stem in either of two ways, depend¬
ing on the morphophonological class of the latter. One group of incorporated stems
combine with a succeeding Hb stem by the insertion of r:
}]3- + mari- + pani^3- + -amajnipa -> p3-u3-mari-panip3-ramajnipa

Other incorporated stems do not require the insertion of r and in this case the general
process of j combination (for which see 1.1) is applicable:
i]3- -f- ra- + utani- -f -amajnipa    tj3-ru-utani-amajnipa
I        p     cry       get up        I got up crying

I        p     grave post see             1 saw the grave post
   The list of incorporated stems which require r insertion amounts to approximately
half the total inventory of these forms, and excludes all forms with final a. Apart
from this, however, a phonological motivation for the distinction is not immediately
apparent as both lists (the list of r forms and the list of non-r forms) consist mainly
of forms which have final a in a neutral environment. The explanation (if indeed
any phonological or morphophonological explanation is to be found) may possibly
be that those instances of morpheme-final a which determine r insertion are derived
historically from u, and those instances which preclude r are derived from i, but,
as no material from earlier periods of the language is available, this explanation
must remain purely hypothetical.","[46, 47, 48]"
"5 SANDHI
Sandhi is a special type of morphophonological process in that the morphem-
boundary at which the process is operative is also a word boundary. The only situe
ation in which sandhi occurs in Tiwi is when unstressed word-final vowel precedes
word-initial vowel, and the only formal process for meeting this situation is the
deletion of word-final vowel:
nua -f- {fiampi + awuta     nua T}iamp awuta
you     straight   they     They are your straight ones
no^a + auijctru   ->   notj auga'ru
other  there           Another one is there
  Sandhi is especially noticeable affecting personal pronouns when they occur
preceding a kinship term with initial vowel. There is a high degree of morphological
cohesion between personal pronoun and kinship term, as the latter never normally
occurs without the former, and this is reflected by a correspondingly high degree
of phonological fusion, resulting in the almost invariable loss of the final vowel of
the personal pronoun:
ijia + uwani -> iji uwani
my     brother my brother
rfira + ilimani -> pir ilimani
her     uncle      her uncle
 Chapter Three
                                                   MORPHOLOGY1   VERBS
Tiwi verbs are sentence-words, capable of functioning as complete utterances in
themselves, and potentially expandable to a high degree of complexity by means
of affixation and noun incorporation. The verb is a layered structure having as its
nucleus a theme, to which various affixes expressing grammatical concepts such as
tense and aspect may be attached. The theme may consist simply of a verb stem
or of a verb stem preceded by one or more incorporated stems expressing lexical
concepts such as ‘fish’, ‘meat’, ‘sleep’. Each stem consists of one or more roots,
with or without derivational affixes. The study of stem structure is not attempted
in the present description, however, as this would be a matter of historical rather
than syntactic relevance. Present-day speakers of Tiwi are not aware of the morpho¬
logical structure of stems and thus, in attempting to analyse them, one would be
engaged in diachronic description rather than in explaining the currently productive
processes of the language.
   An example may help to clarify the preceding description of the layered structure
of verbs. The verb ji-ni-mdni-ka-marikua^apd-pufjipa, ‘He came and hit me in the
eye while I was dancing in the evening’, consists of a theme marikua/jdpa-pu^ipa,
‘dancing —hit eye’, preceded by ji-, ‘he past’, /»-, ‘distance’, wan/-, ‘me’, and ka-
‘evening’. The theme consists of the verb stem -putjipa, ‘hit in the eye’, preceded by
the incorporated stem marikuaijdpd-, ‘dancing’. The internal structure of both the
stems is somewhat obscure but -puijipa probably consists of puiji-, ‘hit’, and -pa,
 eye , and marikuatjapa- probably consists of mari-, ‘with’ plus obscure morphemes
kua- and ijapa-. The obscurity of the structure of the stems is indicative of the fact
that these forms are no longer felt to be morphologically composite.","[51, 52]"

the general principle being that a changes to u in environments in which the pre¬
ceding consonant is a labial and the following consonant labial or velar, a preceding
p having a much stronger rounding effect than an m\
a- -I- pa- + mani- -f- -pimi -> am-pu-pani-pimi
she    np    me        hit      She hits meThere is also some dissimilation, a being advanced to / in the environments k-p
and p-p, as either a or m would tend to disappear in these environments:
pa- -f- Ca- + ka- -f- pa- + -apa -> pa-pi-i-ki-p-apa
I       cv    eve     hw    eat     I ate on the way (in the evening)
241.2 Prenasalisation of intervocalic stops
Many intervocalic stops (in morphemes of all kinds — both stems and affixes) are
optionally prenasalised — that is, a homorganic nasal may be inserted preceding
the stop, e.g., mauntupiiija, ‘skinny fish’,     majntumputja, papmiijata, ‘pregnant
woman’,      papujiijanta, and jdvdkdpai, ‘crocodile’,   jdrdijkdpai. The process does
not apply to all intervocalic stops, however, but only to some — e.g., pupimi, ‘good’
 -> pumpuni, but kukuni, ‘water’ does not -> *ku^kuni — and there is no general
principle of any kind, either grammatical, semantic, or phonological, which could
predict the cases where the process applies. There is a general rule that the process
does not operate across a morpheme boundary, and this helps to limit the number
of cases where prenasalisation might occur, but a great many cases still remain
for which there is no general rule. It is simply necessary to learn by heart the cases
where prenasalisation may apply. In a few cases prenasalisation does even apply
across a morpheme boundary but this is only where the degree of morphological
cohesion is very high.
   Nasals which are inserted optionally by the prenasalisation process have to be
distinguished from nasals which are present in the underlying morphophonological
representation of the morpheme and are therefore obligatory. For example, the
nasals in larjkdijaijki, ‘eagle’, and in mamputja, ‘bark canoe’, cannot be omitted
in any occurrence of these words, and it has to be assumed that they are present
in the morphophonological representation and are not merely inserted by an
optional prenasalisation rule.
1.3 Deletion of y and u
y and u are deleted in specific vocalic environments — y in the environment a-a
and A in the environment i-i — in all but the most careful and formal types of
pronunciation, e.g., purjintaya, ‘head’, ^ pufjintaa; aya, ‘Hey!’, ^ aa; kuijiini,
‘little boy’,   kiijlini', juikdjimi, ‘He did it’, ^ jiikajimi. Although most speakers
use the shorter forms most of the time, they remain aware of the ‘correct’ forms
(i.e., the underlying morphophonological representations) and tend to insist on
these in correcting the linguist’s pronunciation. The deletion of u in the specified
environment is not quite general but is certainly not restricted to any particular
morpheme class.","[39, 40]"
"1.7 Negation
There are two types of negation — predicate phrase negation (i.e. the negation of
the predicate phrase as a whole) and noun phrase negation.
1.7.1 Predicate phrase negation
The negation of the predicate phrase is usually achieved by the insertion of a negative
adverb ka/lu or aunuijkwa at the beginning of the phrase.
para   kaj'lu   pauawani        He (is) not hungry
he     not      hungry
awurini   ka/lu jiriiuwa'ui       The man didn’t go
man       not    he went
amupkwa jirijlakauimi         He didn’t do it
not      he-did it
ka/lu and amupkwa are freely interchangeable, the latter being the native Tiwi
word and the former a Jiwadja loan word which is rapidly replacing it.
                                                                                    69   An alternative, but much less usual, method of negating the predicate phrase
is the suffixation of the negative enclitic -amaui to the last word of the phrase.
ijara   kiuijtin-amaji           He (is) not little
he      little-not
wuta pajlu^wan-amaui     They (were) not dead
they dead-not
Some speakers regard the negative adverbs and -amaui as mutually exclusive, but
others sometimes use double negative forms which contain both.
para    ka/lu       kuitin-amaui        He (is) not little
he      not         little-not
  In verbal sentences, negation of any type or by any means always requires the
verb form to be changed into the subjunctive. (See Morphology, 1.1.8 for subjunctive
verb forms.)
awunupakupauli        ka/lu jinimatakupauli
he’ll come back       he won’t come back
para tiikdJdwala                para ka/lu j^itakdudwala
he sang                         he didn’t sing1.7.2 Noun phrase negation
Noun phrase negation is achieved by substituting a negative pronoun karakuwani
‘no one’ or karakamini ‘nothing’ for a particular noun phrase. In this type of negation,
too, verbs have to become subjunctive.
karakuwani jinimatakupauli         No one will come back
no one        he-come back
karakamini jila'ju       (There is) nothing inside
nothing       inside
The Tiwi usually avoid negative pronouns as object. For instance they would not
say ‘I saw no one’ but ‘I looked. No one!’.","[84, 85]"
"2.4.1 Unstressed final vowel
The general rule for verbal suffixation is that unstressed morpheme-final vowel is
deleted preceding a suffix with initial vowel:
                                                                                      33)j3- + -pimi 4- -amia -> tjd-Jd~pun-amia
I      hit      refl     I hit myself
ji- + -kdJimi + -ami + -ani -> ji-i-kdjam-am-ani
 he   do        mv     rep      He kept on doing it2.4.2 Unstressed final a
The exception to the general rule stated in 2.4.1 is that unstressed stem-final a is
not deleted preceding -ami or -ani. In this environment -ami and -ani take initial w,
and the a of -ani is changed to i, (i.e., -ami     -mami and -ani -> -mini):
a-      pa- 4- uJiitja- 4- -kaudwala 4- -ami -> am-pu-unjli-kajdwala-mami
he      np     dur         sing         mv      He’s going around singing
t]3- 4- ta- 4- utiija- 4- -ka.iawala 4- -ani -» rjan-tu-uffti-kauawala-mini
I       p      dur        sing          rep     I kept on singing.2.4.3 -apa 4- suffix
The verb root -apa, ‘eat’ (which may either occur independently as a stem or as
part of the stem -maijapa, ‘drink’), is unique in its method of combining with suffixes
(other than -and). This method is the insertion of k instead of m, and, in this case,
there is no change in the initial vowel of -ani, but the final a of -apa is changed to u:
ga- 4- i- 4- -apa 4- -ami -> tji-i-apu-kami
I      iv    eat     mv      I’m just going to eat
ija- 4- ra- 4- utiija- -h -apa 4- -ani -> ya-ru-untip-apu-kani
I       p      dur        eat     rep     I kept on eating2.4.4 Stressed final vowel
Stressed stem-final vowel is not deleted or changed in any way preceding a suffix:
ija- 4- ra- 4- utiija- 4- -mu 4- -ani       ija-ru-untipa-mu-ani
I       p      dur        sit    rep        I kept sitting down2.4.5 Stem 4- -ua
Stems combine with the locative suffix -ua, whose occurrence is restricted to im¬
perative verbs, in the following ways;
(a) Unstressed stem-final / is deleted:
       Ca- 4- -puni 4- -ua -> ta-pun-ua
       imp    hit      loc    Go and hit him!
 (b) Unstressed stem-final a is retained and -ua      -pa:
       Ca- 4- -kauawala 4- -ua       ta-kajawala-pa
       imp    sing         loc       Go and sing!
 (c)   Following -apa, ‘eat’, or -maijapa, ‘drink’, k is inserted and the final a of the
       stem is changed to u:
       Ca- 4- -maijapa 4- -ua      ta-maijapu-kua
       imp     drink        loc    Go and drink!
 (d) Stressed stem-final vowel remains unchanged and determines no change in
     -ua:
     Ca- 4- -mu -f -ua -> ta-mu-ua
     imp     sit      loc   Go and sit down!
 The stem -u'ji, ‘go’, although it has a stressed final vowel, is exceptional, and com¬
 bines with -ua by method (b):
 Ca- + -u'ji 4- -ua -> tu-aui-pa
 imp   go       loc    Come here!
343 NOMINAL MORPHOPHONOLOGY
The description of nominal morphophonology consists of just two sections —
3.1, Prefixes, and 3.2, Suffixes. Both of these sections are very brief owing to the
simplicity of the nominal morphology.
3.1 Prefixes
The only riominal prefix is the plural prefix Ca-, the initial consonant of which
is a reduplication of the initial consonant of the stem;
Ca- + kuijli- + -Wi        ka-kui^u-wi
pi      small     pi       children
Ca- + murukupwaua + -Wi -> ma-murukupwau-uwi
pi     girl               pi       girls
There are certain irregularities in the combination of Ca- with stems with initial
vowel, but, as all the irregular forms are listed in Morphology 2.2.2, there is no
need to describe them here.
3.2 Suffixes
Each of the three nominal suffixes-Ni, ‘masculine’, -Ka, ‘feminine’, and -Wi,
‘plural’ — has two morphologically conditioned variants, the variants in each case
having different but homorganic consonants. The variants of -Ni are -ni and -ti,
the variants of -Ka are -ya and -ka, and the variants of - Wi are -wi and -pi\
                            Masc           Fern            Plural
             ‘human’        tini           titja           tiwi
             ‘good’         pupuni        pupuka           pupuwi
             ‘child’        mwauti         mwauitja        mwojuwi
             ‘greedy’       puijkauini    puijkdjika       puijkdjipi
   The variation is conditioned morphologically, there being no general phonological
or semantic factors which could account for it. Although -ni, -pa and -wi form a
set, and -ti, -ka and -pi another set, there is no guarantee — as the above examples
show      that any given nominal stem will take all three suflfix forms from the same
set. As -ni, -pa and -wi are much more common than -ti, -ka and -pi, the easiest
method of generating correct nominal forms is to memorise all the nominal stems
which take any member of the latter set. All other stems can then be assumed to
take -ni, -pa and -wi. The probable historical explanation of the present facts is
that -«/, -pa and -wi are a relatively new development and have gradually been re¬
placing the older set of forms. Currently, -ti, -ka and -pi have ceased to be productive.
   Except in monosyllabic stems, stem-final i is changed to u preceding w or between
labial and velar consonants (as explained in 1.1):
                              Masc              Fern             Plural
             ‘black’          tuniwini          tuniwupa         tuniwuwi
             ‘wallaby’        aumpini           aumpupa         aumpuwi
   Recutting of nominal structures — perhaps only in relatively recent times —
has led to the appearance of new forms of -ni, -pa and -wi having an initial vowel.
Historically, the correct analysis of forms such as tuniwini, tuniwupa, tuniwuwi is
tuniwi-ni, tuniwu-pa, tuniwu-wi, but present-day speakers of the language have re¬
located the morpheme boundary in at least some forms of this kind and reinterpreted
them as, e.g., tuniw-ini, tuniw-upa, tuniw-uwi. That is, the suffixes are now felt to
be -ini, -ipa and -uwi, although, historically, the initial vowel does not belong to
them but has been acquired from the stem. The evidence of the recutting is that,
whenever a new nominal stem-f suffix structure is to be generated, this is done by
deleting the stem-final vowel and adding -ini, -ipa or -uwi. For example, the newly
formed feminine equivalent of alawuua, ‘boss’, is alawuuipa, not *alawujapa as it
would have been if it had been formed in the same way as the old-established
feminines, and the newly formed plural of pwajla, ‘shell’, is pwa^uwi, not *pwaj[awi.
                                                                                  35
4 ENCLITICS
There are just two enclitics-ana, ‘interrogative’, and -la, ‘repetition’ — and
neither of these ever undergoes any type of morphophonological change. Morpheme-
final vowel is deleted preceding -ana:
li- -I- -kBJimi + -ana -> ^i-i-kdJdm-ana
you     do         int      Have you done it?
t)il}!ia -I- pauawani + -ana          pajawan-ana
you          hungry     int      Are you hungry?","[48, 49, 50, 51]"
" 1.4 Expansion
 The sentence may be expanded by the insertion of optional elements whose function
 is to place the action referred to in its spatio-temporal context, and to add information
 about the persons and things involved in it in a peripheral way. These elements are
 T1 (Temporal), L (Locative), Ma (Manner), In (Instrument) and B (Benefactive).
 Tl, whose function is to indicate the time at which the action took place, is mani¬
 fested by time adverbs such as lapinaui ‘in the morning’, av.’ulanaui ‘in the afternoon’,
 parjari ‘tomorrow’. L, whose function is to indicate the place at which the action
 took place, is manifested by place names such as marakawijatja and wuhaij'ku,
 common nouns such as wauta ‘bush’, tiijata ‘beach’, and relator-axis phrases like
 ka uputja ‘in the grass’. Ma, whose function is to indicate the manner in which the
 action was performed, is manifested by a small number of manner adverbs such as
 mamana ‘softly’, and the adjectives pumpuni ‘good’ and tUti ‘bad’ and their synonyms.
 In, whose function is to indicate the thing (if any) with which the action was performed,
 is manifested by nouns and noun phrases of appropriate meaning such as taijini
 ‘stick’, wauapa ‘stone’. B, whose function is to indicate the person for whom the
 action was performed, is manifested by personal names, common animate nouns
 and relator-axis phrases.

  V           B
  cuuwuuiya ijatnpi wuta jitjkitaui      He wraps it up for their kinsmen
  he-wraps    for     their kinsmen
     The place of the optional elements in sentence structure is shown by the following
  tree diagram, in which VP means the obligatory part of the predicate phrase and
  Av is a general cover label for the optional elements.
                                           Sentence
    In surface structure the order of VP and Av can be reversed provided the order
  of S and P is reversed. The various arrangements possible are shown below.
66
 S        V        O         In
j3r3kati jiikajimi mamputja kauma jurupuni
 Jsrakati he-made canoe      needle vine
Jarakati made canoes with needle and vine
 V         O         In               S
jUkauimi mampwja kauiwa jurupuni jarakati
 he-made canoe       needle vine      Jarakati
 Jarakati made canoes with needle and vine
In               VOS
kajiwa jurupuni jiikauimi mamputja jarakati
needle vine      he-made canoe       Jarakati
Jarakati made canoes with needle and vine
  The order of V and O may also be reversed, of course (under the conditions stated
in 1.3), and both S and O may be deleted. As the bracketing suggests, Av may not
as a rule be inserted between V and O, but the flexibility of Tiwi word order is such
that no order is completely excluded, although it may be undesirable and generally
avoided.
  Time adverbs are often placed at the beginning of a sentence, where they function
as an introducer.
T1         S            V            L
pajlirjari purukupauli jiimajitjara jaijamti
long ago Purukupaili lived (at)     Jagainti
T1              S         V
paijatapapari   taikuwapi joi wuuimi
next morning    everybody dances
  It is difficult to suggest the order in which the optional elements would be combined
as it is not usual to have two or more of these elements in a sentence, except where
T1 is inserted initially, as shown in the above examples. Ma is more closely related
to the verb than the others, and therefore probably closer physically, and L would
probably be closer than Tl, but it is difficult to give any opinion about the relative
order of the others.
   The use of optional elements in non-verbal sentences is severely restricted, owing
to the non-active nature of the predicate, and is practically confined to the insertion
of Tl, usually in initial position, e.g. pajlitjari kwoka, niijani kanijawa ‘Long ago
(there was) mashed xamia nuts, today (there is) bread’, waijitjkitai kiana ‘Soon
(it will be) ripe’.","[81, 82]"
"2.2 Plural forms
Plural nominals are formed by either of two methods — suffixation or reduplication
plus suffixation. Suffixation alone is by far the more common (and currently the
only productive) method, reduplication being restricted to a small number of
nominals which are listed below. Generally, only human nouns are used in the
plural, other nouns being used in the singular in all of their occurrences, e.g.,
laldrima unnaja, ‘three days’, (literally ‘three day’), taikuw'ani waliwalini, ‘many
ants (literally ‘many ant’), munikuwutja lipunukua, ‘He lined up his throwing sticks’
(literally ‘throwing stick he lined up’). As pointed out in 2.1.1, however, the ‘human’
class includes at least three animals — pdlatjamwani, ‘dog’, tajamini, ‘dingo’ and
muani, ‘goanna’ — and these are used in the plural like any other ‘human’ noun.
                                                                                        53It also has to be noticed that both human and non-human nouns are used in the
singular when the whole class is referred to rather than specific members of it, e.g.,
murukupwaua pumpuka, ‘Young girls are nice’ (literally ‘young girl nice’), palimajiija
lUUja, ‘Barren women are no good’ (literally ‘barren woman no good’).
   The plural suffix is -Wi and this has morphologically conditioned variants -wi
and -pi. There is no general principle for predicting whether any particular stem will
take -wi or -pi, but the -pi plurals are quite few and can easily be listed. - Wi replaces
-Ni and -Ka in the plural forms so that the gender contrast is neutralised in the
plural. Some examples are given below.
                  Masculine               Feminine               Plural

    Reduplicating plurals have — in addition to the plural suffix - IT/            a plural
prefix Ca-, the initial consonant of which is a reduplication of the initial consonant
of the stem. The formula for such plurals is thus Ca- -f- stern + -Wi. As there are
only nineteen reduplicating plurals in the data these are all listed below. There are
irregularities in the form of many of them but there is no need to specify these
irregularities as the forms are all listed.

 1. Kinship terms are for male Ego and do not occur without personal pronouns.
 2. The singular form from which maminiijkuwi, ‘women’, is derived, is extinct.
 Similarly, some of the other plurals appear not to be derived from the existing singular
 forms, e.g., kmjkdualipi, ‘half siblings’, kakanutjkdluwi, ‘adults’, and papuruluwi,
 ‘old men’.
 3. Ca- is optional in mamuruntawi, ‘white people’, and in kakdtiupkdluwi, ‘adults’.
4. mamanta, ‘friends’, is the only reduplicating plural which does not also have
a suffix. It may be that this represents the older plural pattern in an unmodified
form, mamanta varies freely with a regularised form mantawi.
 5. Contrary to appearances, the location of Ca- in auikakulapi and in
jaritjapapdAanJiuwi is not the result of infixation but of prefixation. The nominal
 stem ajikula- found in ajikulani is probably a fossilised verb consisting of a subject
 prefix a-, ‘he’, the link form ji-, and a verb stem -kula perhaps meaning ‘to be big’.
 The location of Ca- in the plural form auikakulapi is the result of prefixation to -kula,
 not of infixation in auikula-. Similarly, jdrhjapduanti, ‘good singer’, is probably
 a fossilised verb with a stem -pduan^i. Ca- is in this case prefixed to -p3uanj(i.","[68, 69, 70]"
"The order of subject and predicate
The normal order of subject and predicate is SP.
S          P
kmupurani jinuu'ui    Kujupurani came
S            P
Jlapara      J(uunai     waijai             found Waijai
S                P
tamdraMpa        pitja          A woollybutt is no good
But this order may be reversed when S is not the theme of the sentence.
 P           S
jinuu'ji     kujupurani           KuJupurani came
PS
jluu{jai    waijai     japara       X^P^ra found Waijai
P          S
jiipa      tamarauiija        A woollybutt is no good
    The difference of meaning between SP and PS can be understood in terms of
 the concept of ‘theme’ introduced by Halliday (Halliday 1967). Theme is not a
 syntactic concept, but refers to the level at which the information content of the
 sentence is organised, and means, roughly, ‘the thing being talked about’. It always
 comes first in a sentence, regardless of its syntactic function. In a Tiwi sentence
 such as jarakati jiikauimi mampupa ‘Jorakati made canoes’, for example, the subject
jarakati is placed first because it is functioning as theme, that is, the speaker introduces
jarakati first as the thing he is talking about, and then goes on to say something about
 this theme — namely that he made canoes. In the reversed sentence, however,
 mamputja JUkauimi jarakati, the speaker introduces the object mampupa ‘canoes’
 as his theme, and information about who made them is then treated as a mere ampli¬
 fication of this topic. The theme structure is reversed although the syntactic structure
 remains the same, apart from order. Usually a subject which is being announced
 for the first time in a discourse is treated as theme, but, having been thus announced,
 it can then be relegated to an amplificatory role, if it is not deleted altogether. This
 fact is the basis of one of the commonest Tiwi stylistic devices, the balanced coupling
 of a pair of mirror-image sentences, e.g. jauua jiikipa kwoka, kwoka jiikipa autjira
jimpaulitja jama ‘XsJua cracked xamia nuts, she cracked xamia nuts that woman
Xsjua’.
  The inversion of the non-verbal sentence is usually accompanied by the insertion
of a pronoun subject, owing to the absence of a subject prefix in the non-verbal
predicate.
P               S
para mamtipa purukupajli         Purukupaili (is) boss
P                    S
para jipwati         japkanapki         Xaflksnagki (had) some honey
P                      S
para    pijualini      japara        X^P^r^ (was) beautiful
                                                                                        63   Another common feature of inverted sentences is the insertion of a demonstrative
in the subject phrase.
P       S
lihja   aufjira    tomarajitja        (It’s) no good, that woollybutt
P             S
auikulani     awara      purikikini        (He was) big, that Purikikini
   The motivation for these devices is to signal structure and to distinguish forms
which would otherwise be homophonous. For example, the sentence murukupwaja
pumpuka ‘the girl (is) nice’ is distinguished from the phrase pumpuka murukupwaja
‘a nice girl’ solely by order. If the former were inverted no formal signal of structural
difference would remain. If a demonstrative is inserted in the subject phrase, however,
the structure becomes clear, as pumpuka aunira murukupwaja ‘(She’s) nice, that
girl’ cannot be mistaken for a modifier-head construction.","[78, 79]"

1.     The location of the groups is shown on the map on p. xii.
2.     Most of the groups have alternative names, as follows: likalawila = autawanapila,
     wmatjkuwila = pajawurujawila, malawila = maj[ulawila, mi^kuwUa = paluntuwila,
     munupula = tmjanapila, wuUaijkuwila = paramp3najliwila, maruawila = paluwijaijdpila,
     iurupula = jatjauntuwila, jaimpi = ijampajapanurawila, ajatjkij[arila = putjkijiiwila,
     mantiimpula = lamulampula.
3.     Masculine and feminine singular forms are obtained by inserting either the masculine
     suffix -Ni or the feminine suffix -Ka, e.g. Jlikdlawdtiila, ‘man of the Jlikalawila group’,
     jlikalawa/jala, ‘woman of the Jlikalawila group’.

                                BIBLIOGRAPHYBooks and articles wholly or partly concerned with the Tiwi are very numerous and
date from the discovery of the islands by the Dutch in 1636. The material dealing
with the British settlement at Fort Dundas on Melville Island in 1824 29 is quite
copious. Scientific study by anthropologists, linguists and others began in 1905 and
has continued ever since, resulting in a constant stream of books and articles. There
have also been a number of popular accounts of the Tiwi in books, newspapers and
journals. The total number of books and articles of all types is now in the region
of 160; 147 of these are listed by Beryl F. Craig in Arnhem Land Peninsular Region
(including Bathurst and Melville Islands), (Occasional Papers in Aboriginal Studies,
No. 8 — Bibliography Series No. 1), Canberra, 1966. Only six of these 160 items
are concerned with the language, and these are listed in the bibliography given
 below as Capell 1940, 1942 and 1967, Oates 1967, Pilling 1960, and Spencer 1914.

"3.1.3 Apposition
Apposition is the process for relating within a phrase two nominal expressions
having the same referent, one serving to identify the referent and the other to define
or characterise it. The identifying nominal is placed first and the defining nominal
follows it.
waijai jimpaulina      Waijai the woman
purukupauli ijunantani      Purukupajli the bereaved man
   The apposition may be between a personal name and a kinship term, a personal
name and a common noun, a kinship term and a common noun, and even between
two kinship terms, but not between two personal names or between two common
nouns. The general principle is that one nominal should uniquely identify the
referent while the other places it in the context of its relationships.
 74 waijai ijara pimajitja  Waijai his wife
 pamatikimi jimpailina      Pamatikimi the woman
 ijara mauani kui^ini    his son the little boy
 ijinja msjani ijia mwauti      your son my son
 Two kinship terms which are placed in apposition have to have the same referent,
 of course. In the final example above ijinjla mduani is ‘your son’ for a man and ^ia
 mwauti is ‘my son’ for a woman.
   Both slots in the construction (Identifier and Definer) may be filled by a nominal
 phrase of any type, including another appositional phrase.
 waijai jimpaulina purukupauli ijara                 punajiija
 Waijai the woman Purukupajli’s wife
 awuta jimwapuwi             kuuupurani     tapara           those lechers Kujupurani and Japara
 Finally, a personal pronoun or demonstrative may be placed in apposition to a
 nominal or nominal phrase, and a personal pronoun may be placed in apposition
 to a demonstrative.
ijara jarakati     he Jarokati
awara jarakati     that one Jarakati
ijara purukupauli ijunantani     he Purukupajli the bereaved man
wuta jaijkanaijki kuuupurani       they Jaqkanaqki and Kujupurani
ijara awara      he that one
For example, ijara jarakati jiikauimi ‘He Jarakati did it’, awara jarakati jiikauimi
‘That one Jarakati did it’, ijara purukupauli ijunantani jiikauimi ‘He Purukupajli
the bereaved man did it’, and so on.","[89, 90]"
"2.1 Prefixes
2.1.1 Subject prefixes
The subject prefixes are rja-, ‘I’, na-, ‘you sg np’, ti-, ‘you sg p’, a-, ‘he np’,y/-, ‘he p’,
a-, ‘she np’, li-, ‘she p’, mu-, ‘you sg and I’, ija-, ‘we ex’, rja-, ‘you pi’, wu-, ‘they np’,
pu-, ‘they p’, and ija-, ‘you pi and we’, and these constitute a single order. The types
of morphophonological change which affect at least some members of the class
are (a) general vowel change (described in 1.1), (b) nasal closure, and (c) deletion
of final vowel.

IJ3- + i- + -apa -I- -ami            iji-i-apu-kami
I      iv   eat      mv              I’m just going to eat
  Morpheme-final a and / change to u preceding w morphemes («-, ‘np’, atd-,
‘morning’, ulhja-, ‘durative’, wdni-, ‘them’, and Ila stems);
1)3- -t- utit)3- -f -mu        i)u-u)irj3- mu
I        dur        sit        I’m sitting downji- -t- -u'ii -> ju-u'ui
 he     go        He went(b) Nasal closure
Apart from //-, ‘you’, ji-, ‘he’, ti-, ‘she’, and perhaps wu-, ‘they’, subject prefixes
take a homorganic nasal closure {m or n) preceding morphemes with initial p or t.
The process is primarily concerned with the combination of subject prefixes with
either of the two tense markers p3- and t3-, but is sometimes extended to cover
combination with other morphemes with initial p or t:
 ) - + p3- -h -puni
1 3                          i)3m-p3-J3-puni
1       f.np    hit          I hit her (non-past)1)3- 4- t3- -t- -puni        i)3n-t3-J3-puni
I       f.p    hit           I hit her (past)
Nasal closure of the subject prefix is obligatory only in certain morphological
combinations in which the degree of morphological cohesion is very high — i.e.
1)3- + p3-, a- 4- p3-, and t)3- (‘we’ or ‘you’) 4- p3- or t3-. In other morphological
combinations the process is optional.(c) Deletion of final vowel
The only subject prefixes to have their final vowel deleted preceding a morpheme
with initial vowel are wu-, ‘they’, and n3-, ‘you’:
wu- + -apa -> w-apa
they  eat     They eat
n3- 4- at3- 4- Ca- 4-        -k3jimi       r)-at3-pa-k3jimi
you    morn imp              do            Do it! (morn.)
Preceding a morpheme with initial u or w, wu- becomes completely fused (phono-
logically) with that morpheme and ceases to have any distinct phonological
manifestation:
 wu- -f W3ni- 4- -pimi             W3ni-puni
 they   them     hit            They hit them
 2.1.2 Tense markers, p3- and t3-
p3- loses its final vowel preceding morphemes with initial vowel (except sometimes
preceding ulii)3-, ‘durative’):
 r)3- 4- p3- 4- -apa    ->   n3m-p-apa
 you     np     eat          You eat
 Where the vowel is not deleted preceding a vowel or semi-vowel (i.e., preceding
 uj[it)3-, ‘durative’, and W3ni-, ‘them’) the normal general process of vowel change
 applies:
 n3- 4- p3- 4- W3ni- 4- -puni            n3m-pu-w3ni-puni
 you     np     them         hit         You hit them
 26 Preceding morphemes with initial p (i.e., preceding Cd-, Ca- and Ilb stems, all of
 which have an initial p inserted by a morphophonological process) pd- becomes
 completely fused with this p and ceases to have any separate manifestation in the
 phonemic representation, although it remains distinct in the morphophonological
 representation:
 a- + pd- 4- -akupauli -> am-pakupauli
 she   np      go back      She goes back
 td- never loses its vowel and is simply affected by general vowel change in the normal
 way preceding a vowel or semi-vowel:
 ijd- + td-     -t-   -apa -> ijdn-tu-apa
 we     p             eat     We ate 2.1.3 Tense markers ra-and a-
 rd- loses its final vowel preceding atd-, ‘morning’, and preceding Ila stems in past
 subjunctive verbs. Elsewhere the vowel is retained but is subject to the normal
 process of change preceding a vowel or semi-vowel:
ijd- + rd- + atd- + -apa -> r/d-r-atu-apa
I      p     morn eat       I ate in the morning
//a- + rd- + -apa             tjd-ru-apa
I      p     eat              I ate
a-    u- following any morpheme which retains its final vowel, but not following
pd- as this morpheme loses its final vowel:
a-    +   d-   + Ca- + -kdjimi         a-u-ra-kdAimi
he        np     fut   do              He will have to do it
a- -h pd- + a- -t- Ca- + -kdjimi -> am-p-d-ra-kdjimi
she   np    np     fut   do         She will have to do it2.1.4 na-, ‘locative’
nd- never loses its vowel and is merely subject to the general process of vowel change
(described in 1.1) preceding a vowel or semi-vowel:
pd- -i- d- + nd-            i- -I- -mapapa -f- -ami     pu-u-ni-i-mapapu-kami
I       np   loc            iv     drink       mv       I’m just going to drink
pd- + d- + nd- + -apa                pu-u-nu-apa
I     np   loc   eat                 I’ll go and eat.2.1.5 ma-, ‘subjunctive’ and a-, ‘incompletive’
Neither ma- nor a- is ever subject to any type of morphophonological change,
except that a- takes initial w following morpheme-final a:
a- -i- a- + Ca- -f -kduimi             a-wa-Jla-kdjimi
he     ic   fut    do                  He’ll try and do it2.1.6 atd-, ‘morning’
atd- is a w morpheme (see 1.1) and combines with the vowel of a preceding morpheme
by means of a w glide. Initial w is inserted when atd- occurs in word-initial position
and initial p when it occurs following ma-, ‘subjunctive’. The final vowel is subject
to change preceding a vowel or semi-vowel in the normal way:
a- 4- atd- 4- -apa            a-watu-apa
he    morn eat                He eats in the morning
atd- 4- Ca- 4- -kduimi -> watd-pa-kduimi
morn imp       do         Do it! (morn.)
ji- 4- ma- 4- atd- 4- Ca- 4- -kdjimi -> ji-ma-patd-pa-kdjimi
 he    sb     morn fut       do          He won’t do it (morn.)
                                                                                       272.1.7 Object prefixes
The object prefixes are as follows: direct object prefixes — mani-, ‘me’, maiji-, ‘you
sg’, mani-, ‘you sg and me’, mawani-, ‘us ex’, mani-, ‘you pi’, wani-, ‘them’, mani-
‘us inc’; indirect object prefixes — ma-, ‘me’, mat}la-, ‘you sg’, ma-, ‘him’, niara-,
‘her’, ma-, ‘you and me’, mapa-, ‘us ex’, maka-, ‘you pi’, japa-, ‘them’, ma-, ‘us inc’.
These prefixes arc subject to both initial and final changes, as described below.
Initial changes
The initial m of those object prefixes which begin with this phoneme is changed
to tj following pa-, ‘non-past’, or ma-, ‘subjunctive’, and in word-initial position:
a- ->r pa- -f mani- -f -pUni -> am-pu-tjani-pUni
she    np     me       hit      She hits me
pit- -f ma- -F mani- -f- -puni + -ana          pu-ma-tjani-pim-ana
they    sb     us        hit     int           Are they going to hit us?
mani- -f- Ca- -t- -ujliara     jjan-ta-liara
me        imp     tell         Tell me!
ma-, ‘him’ (indirect), is an exception, changing the initial mio n instead of //:
a-    pa-     ma- -H -kapmi -> am-pa-na-kapuui
she   np      him    spear     She spears him.
Final changes
The final vowel of direct object prefixes is optionally deleted preceding a morpheme
with initial vowel. A stop {t or }), which is homorganic with the final nasal of the
object prefix, is then inserted initially in the following morpheme:
a- -f mani- -h -ampuna -> a-man-tampuga
he    me       follow     He follows me
t]a- -f- ra- -H mat^i- + -upujii     t}a-ra-mat}-j(upujli
I        p      you      see         I saw you.
Irregular forms
The indirect object prefixes ma-, ‘him’, mara-, ‘her’, and japa-, ‘them’, have irregular
forms in word-initial position and following         ‘you’. ‘Him’ is anta- in word-initial
position and ta- following     ‘her’ is ija- both in word-initial position and following
tja-; and ‘them’ is apa- both in word-initial position and following i}a-:
ma- -H Ca- -f -kauimi -> anta-ra-kauimi
him    imp    do         Do it for him!
mara- -t- Ca- -f -kauimi -> tja-ta-kauimi
her       imp    do         Do it for her!
japa- -f Ca- -b -kauimi -> apa-ra-kauimi
them     imp    do         Do it for them!2.1.8 ulitja-, ‘durative’
There are a number of mutually independent morphophonological processes affecting
the form of this morpheme, as explained below.
(a) The initial syllable is deleted in combining with an object prefix:
^3. + ra- -f ma(}i- + ulitja- -b -piuni + -ani -> ya-ra-majj-iitja-pUn-ani
I      p        you       dur        hit     rep     I kept on hitting you
(b) The final syllable is deleted preceding lib stems and Ca-, and optionally preceding
some stems with initial consonant (Ilb stems and Ca- take initial r following ujlitja-,
and unstressed / becomes a preceding r):
a- -b ulitja- -b -inti -> a-uj(a-rinti
he    dur         stand     He’s standing
28//a- + uiiij3- + -k3jimi -> tju-utd-kduimi
I      dur       do         I’m doing it(c) Preceding Ila stems (which do not take an initial r) only the final vowel is deleted;
ijd- + Mi/z/a- + -apa      iju-utuj-apa
I       dur        eat     I’m eating.(d) The stop Q) is optionally prenasalised by the general process for this described
in 1.2;
a- +          + -mu       a-urfjlipa-'/nu
he   dur        sit       He’s sitting down2.1.9 Ca-, ‘connective-emphatic’
The prefix Ca-, which is used in non-imperative verbs in the construction of
‘walkabout’ forms and in 'imperative verbs as a means of signalling emphasis,
exhibits a rather complex type of consonantal alternation which may be called
lib alternation as it is practically the same as that which characterises the Ilb class
of stems. The initial consonant is p, /, t, r, or /, depending on the morphological
environment, p occurs when the morpheme follows a subject prefix (other than
t}3- in imperative verbs), the tense markers p3-, t3- and ra- (except in subjunctive
verbs), and the ‘morning’ prefix at3- (except in imperative verbs). / occurs when
the niorpheme follows r3- in subjunctive verbs or a-, ‘incompletive’, or at3-,
‘morning’, in imperative verbs, t occurs when the morpheme is in word-initial
position or following ma-, ‘subjunctive’, or a direct object prefix, r occurs following
an indirect object prefix in non-imperative verbs and following              ‘durative’.
/ occurs following wa-, ‘you’, in imperative verbs and following indirect object
prefixes in imperative verbs;
Ca- -I- Ca- -f -mu -> t3-pa-mu
emph imp       sit    Sit down! (emphatic)
r}3- 4- Ca- -f Ca- -I- -mu         n3-l3-pa-mu
you     emph imp       sit         Sit down! (emph. pi.)
at3- -I- Ca- -1- Ca- -H -'mu -> wat3-l3-pa-'mu
morn emph imp           sit     Sit down! (emph. morn.)
a- -t- Ca- + tj3- -t- -apa        a-pu-ij-apa
he     cv    hw       eat         He eats on the way
a- -t- ujlip3- + Cd- -f tj3- -f -apa        a-uni3-r3-jj-apa
he     dur       cv     hw      eat         He’s eating on the way2.1.10 Ca-, ‘future-imperative’
Ca- has initial p, /, /, or r, depending on the morphological environment, p occurs
when Ca- follows a subject prefix (except in modally marked verbs), any of the
tense markers pa-, t3- or ra- (except in subjunctive verbs^ the ‘morning’ prefix
at3- or the ‘emphatic’ prefix Ca-. / occurs following ra- in past subjunctive verbs,
following a-, ‘incompletive’, and following a direct object prefix with final dental
nasal, t occurs when the morpheme is in word-initial position, or in subjunctive
verbs following ma-, ‘subjunctive’, or a non-past subject prefix, or follows a direct
object prefix other than mart/-, ‘you sg’, or follows the indirect object prefix mara-,
‘her’, r occurs when the morpheme follows «a- in imperative verbs, or a- in com-
pulsional verbs, or any indirect object prefix except mara-, ‘her’;

I      you       fut   do                I’ll do it for you
The vowel of Ca- is changed by metathesis preceding -u'ji, ‘go’, and a few other
lla stems with initial u:
Ca- + -u'ui -> tu-a'ui
imp     go      Go away!
2.1.11 A:a-,‘evening’
The vowel of ka- is deleted preceding a Ila stem but retained preceding a Ilb stem.
In the latter case a -> / by the general process of vowel combination:
//a- + ka- + -apa -> tja-ua-k-apa
1      eve     eat      I eat in the evening
ija- + ka- + -akupauli         ^a-ua-ki-akupauli
I      eve   go back           I go back in the evening
(The insertion of ua- preceding ka- is dealt with in 2.2.)2.1.12   pa-, ‘half way’, and raja-, ‘walking’
)ja- and raja- have their final vowel deleted preceding a stem with initial vowel:
pu- + ra- + Ca- + pa- + -apa -> pu-ra-pu-p-apa
they    p      cv     hw       eat    They ate on the way
pu- + ra- + Ca- + raja- + -apa -> pu-ra-pa-raj-apa
they  p     cv    wk     ^ eat    They ate going along2.2 ua- insertion
Stems with initial consonant may not be immediately preceded in the phonemic
representation by any of the following prefixes: any subject prefix; either of the
tense markers pa-, ‘non-past’, or ta-, ‘past’; na-, ‘locative’, or ata-, ‘morning’. If
any one of these prefixes occurs immediately preceding a stem with initial consonant
in the morphophonological representation, a meaningless segment ua- has to be
inserted between the prefix and the stem:
pa- -f -kauimi -> pa-ua-kauimi
I       do         I do it
pa- + na- + -mapapa -> pa-na-ua-mapapa
I     loc   drink      1 drank (at a distance)
pa- -f- ata- + -majaripi -> pu-ata-ja-majaripi
I       morn lie down       I lie down (in the morning)
Following ji-, ‘you sg p’, ji- ‘he p’, or ji-, ‘she p’, ua- -> (The vowel is advanced
by the attraction of the vowel in the prefix and j is deleted by a general process for
j deletion between two close front vowels.):
ji- -I- -kauimi -> ji-ua-kauimi      ji-i-kauimi
   The ‘evening’ prefix, ka-, which belongs to a very late order and, when it occurs,
is usually the last prefix before the stem, determines ua- insertion in exactly the
same way as a stem with initial consonant. That is, if ka- occurs and is immediately
preceded in the morphophonological representation by any of the morphemes
listed above, ua- has to be inserted preceding ka-:
pa- -I- ka- + -apa -> pa-ua-k-apa
I       eve    eat       I eat in the evening
pa- + na- + ka- -1- -kauimi -> pa-na-ua-ka-kauimi
I     loc   eve     do         I did it in the evening
30When k3- is preceded by C3- a meaningless / is inserted automatically between them
(and this affects the vowel of Ca-):
//a- + ra- + Ca- + ka- + tja- + -apa         ija-ra-pi-i-ki-rj-apa
I      p       cv      eve   hw      eat     I ate on the way (in the evening)
   J3- insertion has an effect on the morphology in the following way: (a) Past tense
verbs are formed by the insertion of a past tense prefix ra- or ta-, e.g., ija-ra-pakupauU,
‘I went back’, (b) Wherever ra- is present in the underlying structure immediately
preceding a stem with initial consonant or the prefix ka- it has to be deleted, as the
meaningless ja- is inserted automatically in these environments and there is a general
prohibition of the sequences uau, rar, jar, or rau. Thus, for example, ^a- + ra- +
-kajimi -> r/a-ja-kajimi. {ua- is inserted because of the initial consonant of the
stem, and ra- is deleted because of the initial j of ja-.) There is, however, no reason
to delete ra- if another morpheme is present preceding the stem or ka-, as this either
precludes the insertion of ja- or at least prevents ra- and ua- from being juxtaposed,
e.g., pu-, ‘they’, + ra-, ‘past’, + mani-, ‘me’, + -puni, ‘hit’           pu-ra-mani-puni,
‘they hit me’, (ua- precluded by the presence of the object prefix mani-.) ija-, ‘I’, +
ra-, ‘past’, + ata-, ‘morning’, + -kajimi, ‘do’, -> ija-r-ata-ja-kajimi, ‘I did it in the
morning’, {ja- insertion determined by the initial consonant of -kajimi, ra- not
deleted because, in this case, ata- comes between ra- and ja-.)
   To sum up, then, the surface structure of verbs depends to some extent on merely
automatic morphophonological processes of insertion and deletion. If the stem
has an initial vowel it may be immediately preceded in the phonemic representation
by a subject prefix or by any prefix which is not excluded on morphological grounds,
e.g., ya- + -apa -> tju-apa, ‘I eat’ — but, if the stem has an initial consonant,
ja- has to be inserted under the conditions stated above, e.g., pa- + -mapapa
pa-ja-mapapa, ‘I drink’. In forming the past tense of verbs ra- is inserted, e.g.,
pa- + ra- + -apa         pa-ru-apa, ‘I ate’, but where ja- has to be inserted ra- has
to be deleted, unless another prefix comes between them, e.g., pa- + ra- + -mapapa
-> pa-ja-mapapa, ‘I drank’. What this means, in effect, is that verbs from the surface
structure of which ra- has been deleted are ambiguous as regards tense, unless the
subject prefix itself carries a tense meaning.","[40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]"

Tiwi is the language of the Aboriginal people of Melville and Bathurst Islands near
Darwin on the north coast of Australia. i The two islands constitute a single
geographical unit and tribal area of approximately 3000 square miles, being
separated by only a narrow channel, in places not much more than half a mile across.
They are separated from the Australian mainland by the Clarence Strait to the
south and the Dundas Strait to the east, and their distance from the continental
coastline varies from about fifty to about fifteen miles at the narrowest points. The
fifteen-mile gap to the south, however, between Cape Gambler (the southern
extremity of Melville Island) and Gunn Point on the mainland opposite, is partly
bridged by a chain of small islands extending north from the mainland, and the
channel between Cape Gambler and the northernmost of these islands is only eight
miles wide. In former times the Tiwi were distributed fairly evenly over the length
and breadth of both islands — i.e., over a total area approximately one hundred
miles from east to west and thirty miles from north to south — but today, as a
result of contact with European culture, they are concentrated in four small settle¬
ments — a Catholic mission in the south-east corner of Bathurst Island, two welfare
settlements in the north-west of Melville Island and a forestry settlement also in
the western part of Melville Island. Apart from these settlements, the islands are
uninhabited and untouched by the hand of man.","[15, 16, 17]"

                                  PROBLEMS OF ANALYSIS1. Treatment of diphthongs
There are a number of diphthongs in Tiwi and the problem which arises in analysing
them is to know whether they are one syllable or two. For example, are kwai, ‘shout’,
and joi, ‘dance’, monosyllabic or bisyllabic?
   The vowel sequences which actually occur are ia, ua, aa, iu, uu, au, ii, ui, ai, oi,
e.g., 'yia, ‘I’, 'nua, ‘you’, tcfapa, ‘Eat!’ tjiu'wani, ‘my younger brother’, tuu'lua, ‘head’,
ff'‘Throw it!’ kii'j(ini, ‘little boy’, ijuUd'mamti, ‘I want it\ jaraka'pai, ‘crocodile’,
'joi, ‘dance’. Of these sequences, ia, ua, iu and ui could be regarded as certainly
bisyllabic. The remainder — aa, uu, ii, au, ai, oi — present a problem. The native
speaker of English, listening to these sequences, would certainly hear ia, ua, iu and ui
as bisyllabic, but would probably hear most instances of the remaining sequences
as monosyllabic. The question is, to what extent does what the Tiwi speaker ‘hears’
differ from what the English speaker ‘hears’? On the level of phonic substance,
aa, uu and // differ very little from the English long vowels a:, u: and             and au,
ai and oi differ very little from the corresponding English diphthongs, and, as these
English long vowels and diphthongs each constitute a single syllable nucleus, it is
natural for the native speaker of English to suppose that the corresponding Tiwi
sequences are also monosyllabic. English and Tiwi speakers are conditioned
differently, however, and it is necessary to disregard the interpretation of the data
which seems natural to a native speaker of English and to try to find out how the
Tiwi interpret it.
                                                                                       19    The facts which suggest that the Tiwi interpret all their vowel sequences as
bisyllabic — regardless of how they actually sound in phonetic terms — are as
follows: (a) The Tiwi vowel sequences are historically different from their apparent
counterparts in English. English ai, au, a:, etc., are each historically one phoneme
(derived from Old English i:, u:, a:), but the Tiwi sequences are historically —
as well as currently — two phonemes. English speakers always have regarded —
and still do regard — ai, for example, as one phoneme, and therefore one syllable
nucleus, but Tiwi speakers certainly regard the ai in their language as two phonemes,
(b) The monosyllabic appearance of the vowel sequences, although it is usual in
 ordinary, rapid speech, tends to disappear in a more careful articulation. For
example, the VV sequences in amat/kini, ‘new’, taiku'wapi, ‘many’ and ta'apa,
 ‘Eat!’ normally sound like single syllables in rapid speech, but, in a more careful
 type of articulation, it is easy to hear the informant actually separating the two
vowels in each sequence and making each a separate syllable nucleus, (c) The diph¬
 thongs always function as two syllables in the word stress pattern. In the normal
 pattern stress comes on the penultimate syllable, and word-final diphthongs will
 only fit into this pattern if they are understood as two syllables. For example,
jarakd'pai, ‘crocodile’, and ndtnaijd'rau, ‘red ochre’, only conform to the norrnal
 stress pattern if ai and au are bisyllabic. (d) When a monosyllabic suffix or enclitic
 is added to a word, the stress has to be shifted one syllable to the right in order
 to remain in penultimate position. When this is done to a word which ends in a
 diphthong the stress shifts to the second element of the diphthong. For example,
 'joi, ‘dance’, + -la, ‘repeatedly’, is jo'ila, ‘dance repeatedly’, niki'nau, ‘you will
 throw fire’, -t- -la, ‘repeatedly, is nikina'ula, ‘you will throw fire repeatedly’, and
pu'nai, ‘husband’, -f -tja, ‘feminine’, is puna'itja, ‘wife’. As there can be no doubt
 that jo'ila, -na'ula, -rufii^a, etc., are each three syllables, the bisyllabic nature of
 any diphthong can be made plain by shifting it to an environment where stress
 comes on the second element.","[34, 35]"
"1   GENERAL PROCESSES
1.1 Vowel combination
The general process for combining morpheme-final vowel with morpheme-initial
vowel, which applies wherever none of the morphologically restricted processes for
                                                                                     23V + V apply, is the insertion of a vocalic glide between the two vowels. There are two
variants of this general process — j insertion and w insertion — the two types being
conditioned morphologically. All morphemes with initial vowel are either j
morphemes or w morphemes (i.e., take either j insertion or w insertion) and there
is no case of a morpheme taking both types, either in free or in conditioned variation.
In combination with the final vowel of a preceding morpheme, j morphemes require
the insertion of an intervening j glide and cause morpheme-final a to change to /,
while w morphemes require the insertion of an intervening w glide and cause both
morpheme-final a and i to change to u. Thus, for example, a j morpheme with initial a,
when combined with morpheme-final a, yields aja, and, when combined with
morpheme-final a, ija; while a w morpheme with initial a, when combined with
the same phonemes, yields awa and uwa respectively. In many cases the j or w letter
can be omitted from the spelling forms as the vowel combination can be read in
only one way — e.g., ia and ua are much neater than ija and uwa and quite
unambiguous — and this is generally done in the examples which follow.","[38, 39]"

"1.7.3 Prohibitions
Commands are negated by the insertion of the form pajiti ‘don’t!’ initially in the
imperative sentence, and the negation requires a change of mood in the verb from
imperative to future incompletive. (See Morphology, 1.1.8.)
 takauimi           ->    pajiti pampatakauimi
 Do it! (sg)              Don’t do it! (sg)
 parakauimi               pajiti pampajlakauimi
 Do it! (pi)              Don’t do it! (pi)

 Go! (sg)                Don’t go! (sg)
 paruwa'ji               pajiti pampatuwa'ui
 Go! (pi)                Don’t go! (pi) 2 SENTENCE JOINING AND EMBEDDING
 Sentences may be related to one another by processes of coordination, subordination
 and embedding. Coordination is the process for linking sentences in a relation of
 mutual non-dependence, and subordination the process for placing one sentence
 in a relation of unilateral dependence on another. Embedding is the process for
 including one sentence within another, as the functional equivalent of a lower level
 structure. The processes are recursive — that is (in principle at least) there is no
 limit to the number of times they may apply, although in practice of course the
 number of applications is usually very small. The structures which result from the
 coordination or subordination of sentences are called complex sentences, and any
 sentence which is included in a complex sentence may be referred to as a clause.
702.1 Coordination
The coordination of clauses within a complex sentence has to be effected in Tiwi
by intonation alone, as there is no form equivalent to English ‘and’. The end of
the sentence as a whole is marked by a fall of intonation, while the non-final character
of the included clauses (other than the last) is signalled by a final rise of intonation.
In the examples given below a full stop is used to indicate a sentence-final fall of
intonation and a comma to indicate a non-final rise.
kalikali    auimi      mari'wi    ampuija.   He runs and gets a belt
run         he-does    belt       he-gets
joi        auimi,     mi     auimi.    He dances and gives it to him
 dance     he-does    give   he-does
mantautja wupukumina, wuuamaru'ui, wmaki^ika.
bark      they-wrap      they-take    they-bury
They wrap him in bark, take him away and bury him.
   Note the optional use of the form apa to signal non-finality, and of ki ‘then’
(sometimes combined with apa) to mark the final clause in a sequence of coordinate
clauses referring to a chronological sequence of events.
mwarakati juunau,     apa, karampi jipauliyi.
Mwarakati he-threw            far-off it-fell
Mwarakati threw and it fell far away.
puAdwari, pmawari, pujawari, puuawari, ki — juwutjapuyipa. They fought and
fought and fought and fought and then — he hit him in the eye.
  Sometimes a sequence of two verbs which are very closely related, in that they
share a single subject, are treated as one clause and given only one clause intonation
pattern, i.e. there is no pause or rise of intonation at the end of the first verb.
juu'ui   jluunai.      He went and found her
juu'ui jipakalirja.          He went and climbed up2.2 Subordination
Subordination is effected by placing a subordinating conjunction at the beginning
of the dependent clause. The conjunctions are kari ‘when’, pili ‘because’, ‘as’, ‘so
that’, and yani, a subordinator without specific meaning whose translation equiva¬
lents may be ‘if’, ‘when’, ‘as’, ‘because’, or ‘so that’. There are no equivalents to
any other English conjunctions, such as ‘although’, and ‘unless’. The subordinate
clauses are of just two kinds — condition clauses (with kari or pani) and reason
clauses (with pili or ijani). Condition clauses normally precede the clause or clauses
on which they are dependent, and reason clauses normally follow.","[85, 86]"
"1.1.3 Subject
Person, number and gender of subject are expressed by means of the subject prefixes
or (as some of the subject prefixes are homophonous) by means of a subject prefix
plus a tense marker pa-, or ta-. The expression of subject is generally inseparable
from the expression of tense as, in most cases, the two are done by the same mor¬
phemes or morpheme sequences. Third-person-singular direct object also has its
expression in the ‘subject’ forms, as explained below.
  The subject forms in non-imperative verbs (except for transitive verbs with third-
person-singular direct object) are as follows:
                                   non-past                  past
                           1.      V3-                       pa-           I

   If third-person-singular direct object is present there are the following changes
in the subject forms: (1) «a- is used for second-person subject, whether singular
or plural, non-past or past. (2) pa- and ta- are deleted when a masculine third-
person-singular direct object is present. (3) pa- or /a- is inserted in all subject forms
except ji- and //- when there is a feminine third-person-singular direct object.
(4) When third-person-singular direct object co-occurs with third-person-singular
subject in past tense verbs the subject prefoes ji- and ^i- are used to express gender
of object, and gender of subject is neutralised, e.g., ji-i-puni means either ‘He hit
him’ or ‘She hit him’, and ji-i-puni means either ‘He hit her’ or ‘She hit her’.
   The subject forms which occur in transitive verbs with third-person-singular direct
object are listed below.:
                          non-past                         past

less of the gender of the actual object (if any), invariably take the subject forms
found in transitive verbs with third-person-singular feminine direct object. No ex¬
planation can be offered for this fact. Some of the commoner f-stems are -kdJdwala,
‘sing’, -kitikimi, ‘puli’, -muijuma, ‘hear’, -aju^umi, ‘swallow’, -alami, ‘put inside’,
and -uwujuyi, ‘put down’. For example, ‘I sing’ is not *ijd-Jd-k3J3wala, as one would
expect, but ijdm-pd-ud-kdjdwala, and ‘He heard it’ is not *ji-i-muijuma but
ii-i-mut]uma.
   The expression of subject in imperative verbs is very simple as these verbs always
have second-person subject. Singular imperative verbs have no subject prefix at all,
and second-person-singular subject is inferred from the absence of a prefix, e.g.,
ta-k3J3^umi, ‘Dig!’ (you sg), ta-wuntali, ‘Keep still!’ (you sg). Plural imperative
verbs are distinguished from singular by the subject prefix «a-, ‘you’, e.g. n3-ra-
k3J3^umi, ‘Dig!’ (you pi), n3-ra-wunj(ali, ‘Keep still!’ (you pi).","[54, 55]"
"   For the purpose of alphabetising, the letters of the Tiwi alphabet are arranged in
the following order: a, i, j, k, 1, m, n, n, p, o, p, r, j, t, %, u, w, y. a is
treated merely as a variant of i, as these cannot be distinguished phonologically,
although both are used for the sake of phonetic realism.
   Nouns are marked m or f (masculine or feminine) to indicate their gender, verbs
and incorporated stems are marked I, Ila or Ilb to indicate their morphophonological
class, and verbal nouns are marked -mi, -ma or -kajimi to indicate the auxiliary verb
stem which they require. For other abbreviations see Symbols and Abbreviations,

"1.2 Physical isolation
The close proximity of Melville and Bathurst Islands to the Australian mainland
would naturally lead one to suppose that there must have been a long history of
close contact between the Tiwi and the mainland tribes nearest to them. This sup¬
position would certainly be erroneous, however, as all the available evidence indicates
that there was scarcely any contact between the Tiwi and the mainland tribes, and
that the Tiwi were, in fact, virtually isolated from the outside world before the first
successful settlement of Europeans on the islands early in the twentieth century.2
   The evidence which bears on the isolation of the Tiwi is of three main kinds
cultural, linguistic and historical — and may be briefly summarised as follows.
Firstly, Tiwi material culture differs from that of the mainland in a number of
striking, although not fundamental, respects. The boomerang and the woomera —
two of the most characteristic artefacts of the mainland — are missing on the islands,
on the other hand, the most important objects of Tiwi ritual and ceremonial, their
grave posts, are not found anywhere on the mainland. Tiwi art, too, is very unlike
that of the mainland, being more highly conventionalised and indeed almost non-
representational. The differences between Tiwi and mainland culture cannot be
 2 fully described here, but it can be stated that they are such as would not be expected
 if close contact had existed between the Tiwi and mainland Aborigines.3
    Secondly, the Tiwi language, while it is clearly of Australian Aboriginal stock,
differs very considerably from the languages of the nearby mainland. On the lexical
level especially, the dissimilarity is almost total as there are virtually no lexical
cognates. This degree of lexical dissimilarity suggests a very long period of isolation
from mainland languages.
    Thirdly, Europeans who lived in the area in the nineteenth century (either on
 Melville Island itself or on the nearby mainland) all gave the same picture of lack
of contact between the Tiwi and the mainland tribes. Major John Campbell, who
was commandant of the British garrison on Melville Island from 1825-1829 never
saw any non-Tiwi visitors during his time there, and was of the opinion that the
Tiwi never went to the mainland (Campbell 1834:158). The ethnologist Earl, who
spent some time at Port Essington to the east of Melville Island in the 1840s, makes
it clear that there was complete lack of contact between the Tiwi and the tribes of
Cobourg Peninsula (Earl 1853). Foelsche, a police inspector in Darwin in the latter
part of the nineteenth century, mentions the occasional raids the Tiwi made on
the mainland for the purpose of stealing women, but had apparently never seen
any Tiwi himself and had no other knowledge of them (Foelsche 1881). There is,
in fact, every indication that Europeans living on the mainland opposite Melville
and Bathurst Islands knew virtually nothing of the Tiwi and had never even seen
them before the islands began to be opened up to the outside world at the beginning
of the twentieth century.
   The reasons why the Tiwi did not cross to the mainland regularly are not hard
to find. First, there was the lack of motivation for making the crossing. The Tiwi
were not short of food or of any of the necessities of Aboriginal life. There was
nothing they lacked which could be supplied by going to the mainland, and hence
no reason for crossing. Secondly, there was the lack of suitable boats for making
the crossing. Like all other Aborigines, the Tiwi had only frail canoes made out
of a single strip of bark, and while long journeys in these were by no means im¬
possible, any sea voyage in such a craft would have been a hazardous enterprise
and would not have been undertaken very often without suflBcient motivation.
Thirdly, the currents in the narrow part of Clarence Strait south of Cape Gambier
are rapid and dangerous, even for modern boats, and much more so for bark canoes.","[17, 18]"

    Attributive sentences are distinguished from equational and possessive sentences
by the different manifesting class of P, as attributive sentences have an adjective
or predicative as predicate and equational and possessive sentences have a noun
or noun phrase as predicate. Equational and possessive sentences are not differentiated
structurally in any way, however (e.g. purukupajli majntina might mean either
‘Purukupajli (is) boss’ or ‘Purukupajli (has) a boss’), and have to be distinguished
in other ways. The distinction is effected primarily by selectional criteria, as, in the
equational sentence, where the two nominals have the same referent, there is
necessarily concord on the animate-inanimate, human-non-human and masculine-
feminine dimensions. Where this selectional congruity between S and P is absent,
it is evident that the relation between them cannot be one of equivalence, and therefore
must be one of possession. For example, kakUiluwi jirjwati (literally ‘children honey’)
can only be understood as ‘The children (have) the honey’ as selectional constraints
exclude ‘The children (are) the honey’ (S is animate, human and plural while P is
inanimate, non-human and singular).
  Ambiguity arises only in those sentences in which selectional congruity exists
between S and P, but these can usually be interpreted correctly through knowledge
of the cultural and situational context. For example, purikikini pakilij^ipa might mean
                                                                                    61either ‘Purikikini (was) a young man prepared for initiation’ or ‘Purikikini (had)
a young man prepared for initiation’. Only knowledge of the cultural context makes
it clear that the latter is the meaning intended.
  The time reference of non-verbal sentences has to be inferred from the context,
as they are not marked for tense in any way.","[76, 77]"
"1.1.6 Tense
There are three tenses — non-past, past and future. Non-past has no time reference
except what is given to it by the context, but is used like the English non-past tense
for the statement of general truths or habitual actions. Tiwi non-past differs from
English non-past, however, in that it is also commonly used with either present
or future time reference, provided the linguistic or extralinguistic context makes
this time reference clear. For example, a-parjulimai may mean ‘he walks’ (regularly
and repeatedly) or ‘he’s walking’ (now) or ‘he’ll walk’ (in the future), and only the
context can make it clear which meaning is intended. The time reference of past
                                                                                          41and future tenses is obvious, but, as there is no perfective aspect in Tiwi, the past
tense forms are used as the translation equivalent not only of English past but also
of English present perfect and past perfect. For example, a past tense form such
as ii-ni-u'ji may be translated ‘she came’ or ‘she has come’ or ‘she had come’, depend¬
ing on the context.
   Non-past verbs have one of the non-past set of subject forms listed in 1.1.3, but
are not otherwise marked for tense. Past tense verbs are formed by (a) selecting
one of the past tense set of subject forms, and (b) inserting the past tense marker
ra- wherever the subject form carries no tense meaning. (An exception to this is
that ra- is inserted following pu-, ‘they’, which has a distinctively past tense meaning.)
For example:
                     non-past                                         past

mu-apa               You sg and I eat              mu-ru-apa           You sg and I ate

   Note that wherever the meaningless se^ent ua- is inserted by the morpho¬
phonology (i.e., preceding a verb theme with initial consonant or the prefix ka-,
‘evening’, — see Morphophonology, 2.2) ra- is not inserted unless another morpheme
is present which would separate ra- and ua-:

tja-ja-kauimi        We inc do it                  tja-ua-kauimi       We inc did it
  There are special difficulties in the formation of past tense verbs with included
locative and past subjunctive verbs, but these are dealt with in the appropriate
sections.
   Future tense verbs have non-past subject forms and are marked by the insertion
of Ca-, ‘future’ (see Morphophonology, 2.1 for an account of the morphophonological
variation of this morpheme):
fja-pa-apa        I’ll eat
I-fut-eat
^a-pa-kajimi         I’ll do it
I-fut-do
a-ma-ra-kauimi         He’ll do it for me
he-me-fut-do
ija-man-ta-jakauai           I’ll give it to you
I-you-fut-give
42 1.1.7 Aspect
There are five marked aspects, as follows: durative, repetitive, moving, beginning
and inceptive. Durative aspect expresses the continuation of an action through
some period of time or at some point of time. Non-past durative is used for an
action which is actually taking place at the moment of speaking, past durative is
used for an action which was taking place throughout some past period of time
or at some past point of time. There is no future durative form. Repetitive aspect
— which is restricted to past tense — expresses the repetition of an action either
on some particular occasion or over a period of time. That is, it is equivalent to
either ‘kept on’ (doing) or ‘used to’ (do). The use of the moving aspect is dependent
on the previous selection of a durative form. This aspect means that the action is
being performed or was being performed while moving about. The beginning aspect
means that the action spoken of is just beginning and the inceptive aspect that it
is just about to begin. Neither of these last two aspects has a past or a future form.
That is, one can say ‘I’m just beginning to do it’, but not ‘I was just beginning to
do it’ or ‘I shall be just beginning to do it’. Durative, repetitive and moving aspects
can be combined to give durative-repetitive, durative-moving and durative-repetitive-
moving forms.
   Durative aspect is formed by inserting the durative prefix
fju-ujlif}-apa     I’m eating
I-dur-eat
a-uniiij3-kdjimi       He’s doing it
he-dur-do
ijd-ru-u^iiitj-apa     I was eating
I-p-dur-eat
iu-ur}id-raumi         She was cooking
she-dur-cook    Repetitive aspect is formed by inserting the repetitive suffix -ani:
ji-i-kajdm-ani     He kept on doing it
 he-lk-do-rep
u-ui}j(i-k3J3m-am         He kept on doing it
he-dur-do-rep
tjd-ru-uf}iiij-apu-kani     I kept on eating
I-p-dur-eat-rep
pu-tu-wuuii-k3J9wala-mini          They kept on singing
they-p-dur-sing-rep   The ‘moving’ aspect is formed by inserting the ‘moving’ suffix -ami:
a-uf}Jliy-apu-kami    He’s eating moving about
he-dur-eat-mv
am-p-uiti(i-k3J3wala-mami          He’s singing moving about
he-np-dur-sing-mv
ju-unjli-kajdm-am-ani         He kept on doing it as he moved about
 he-dur-do-mv-rep   The ‘beginning’ aspect is formed by inserting the ‘beginning’ prefix wi-, the
‘future’ prefix Ca- and the ‘moving’ suffix -ami:
yu-wi-Jia-apu-kami          I’m just starting to eat
I-bg-fut-eat-mv
a-wi-ia-k3J3m-ami           He’s just starting to do it
he-bg-fut-do-mv
a-wi-Jla-p un-ami         He’s starting to hit him
he-bg-fut-hit-mv
                                                                                    43  The inceptive aspect is formed by inserting the inceptive prefix /- and the
‘moving’ suffix -ami:
iji-i-apu-kami      I’m just about to eat
1-iv-eat-mv
a-i-kajdm-ami         He’s just about to do it
he-iv-do-mv
am-pu-ijani-i-pun-ami         She’s just going to hit me
she-np-me-iv-hit-mv1.1.8 Mood
In addition to the unmarked indicative mood, there are four marked moods. These
are imperative, subjunctive, compulsional and incompletive. The imperative mood is
used for giving commands, and for this only. The subjunctive mood is the mood
for whatever is thought of as merely possible or hypothetical rather than actual,
and has three main obligatory uses: (a) in negative clauses; (b) in non-past or future
interrogative clauses; (c) in the expression of whatever is possible but unlikely —
e.g., ‘If I wanted to I would hit him’. There are past, non-past and future subjunctive
forms. The compulsional mood expresses compulsion, obligation or necessity, and
is equivalent to ‘must’ (do) or ‘have to’ (do). There are both non-past and future
compulsional forms. The incompletive mood is used for whatever is merely attempted
or begun but not completed, and translates ‘try to’ (do) or ‘begin to’ (do). There
are past, non-past and future incompletive forms. The second-person forms of the
future incompletive are also used in prohibitions. The five moods are mutually
exclusive — it is not possible to combine subjunctive and incompletive, for example.
Nor is it possible to combine marked mood with marked aspect. A verb may be
marked either for mood or for aspect, but not for both.
   Imperative verbs are marked by the insertion of the future-imperative prefix Ca-.
Singular imperative forms are distinguished from all other verbs by the absence of
a subject prefix. Plural imperative forms have the subject prefix tja-, ‘you’:
ta-apa        Eat! (you sg)
imp-eat
ta-kauimi          Do it! (you sg)
imp-do
ijan-ta-iiara        Tell me! (you sg)
me-imp-tell
rj3-ra-apa         Eat! (you pi)
you-imp-eat
Qa-ra-kauimi         Do it! (you pi)
you-imp-do
(ja-^an-ta-jliara       Tell me! (you pi)
you-me-imp-tell
   Non-past subjunctive is formed by inserting the subjunctive prefix ma- and selecting
one of the past tense subject forms:
ojnutjkwa ji-ma-kauimi         He doesn’t do it
not         he-sb-do
j(i-ma-'mu autjwara          Does she sit here?
she-sb-sit here
   Future subjunctive is formed in the same way as non-past subjunctive but the
‘future’ prefix Ca- is also inserted:
ojnu^kwa ji-ma-ta-kauimi         He won’t do it
not          he-sb-fut-do
amu^kwa ji-ma-ijan-ta-pUni         He won’t hit me
not          he-sb-me-fut-hit
44pu-ma-ta-wari           Are they going to fight?
they-sb-fut-fight
  Past subjunctive is formed either by inserting the past tense prefix ra- alone or
by inserting ra- + Ca-. The forms with ra- + Ca- refer to a specific occasion in
the past but the forms with ra- only do not specify an occasion:
aunutjkwa ji-ra-ta-kduimi              He didn’t do it
not        he-p-fut-do
amu^kwa ji-ra-kdjimi                 He never did it
not      he-p-do
     Note the use of past subjunctive in speaking of what is possible but unlikely:
tjdni    tjd-rd-ta-tdmaunti     ija-ra-ta-maijapa          If I wanted to I should drink it
if       I-p-fut-want           I-p-fut-drink
  ra- does not co-occur with the subject prefixes ^/-, ‘you’, or //-, ‘she’, and cannot
be inserted if either of these is present:
amu^kwa       ti-ta-kauawala           She didn’t sing
not           she-fut-sing
  Compulsional verbs may be either non-past or future. Non-past compulsional
verbs are formed by inserting the prefix a- alone and future compulsional verbs
by inserting both a- and Ca-:
a-u-kajimi          He has to do it
he-cp-do
a-u-ra-kajimi           He will have to do it
he-cp-fut-do
am-p-a-rakupauli          She has to go back
she-np-cp-go back
am-p-a-ra-jakupauli             She will have to go back
she-np-cp-fut-go back
  Incompletive verbs may be either non-past, past or future, and are formed by
inserting the incompletive prefix a-. Non-past verbs have non-past subject forms
and past verbs have past subject forms. Future verbs have non-past subject forms
and the prefix Ca- inserted:
a-wa-ji-mayapa          He tries to drink
he-ic-lk-drink
ju-a-ji-maijapa         He tried to drink
he-ic-lk-drink
a-wa-ta-maijapa               He’ll try to drink
he-ic-fut-drink
(Note that ui- in the first two examples is a meaningless segment inserted by a
morphophonological process. See Morphophonology, 2.2.)
   The second-person forms of the future incompletive are also used in prohibitions:

1.1.9 Voice
The marked voices are reflexive, reciprocal, collective and causative, these being
expressed by suffixes -amia, -a^iri, -animi and -amiyi, respectively:

I-lk-hjt-refl
                                                                                   45n’-u-ra-lu-aliri             They will have to give to one another

they-p-follow-coll
pa-ja-kauam-amiyi         I made him do it
I-lk-do-caus
-animi may also refer to the completeness of the action, e.g., pu-ua-kajam-animi
may mean ‘They finished it’, ‘They did it completely’, and pii-ja-pun-ammi ‘fhey
killed all of them’.","[56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]"
"1   SENTENCES
1.1 Predication
Predication, the basic sentence-forming process, is the deep structural relation of
a noun phrase as subject with a verbal or non-verbal phrase as predicate.
                                     Sentence -> SP
Predication may be either verbal (expressing an action of the subject) or non-verbal
(expressing a state or quality of the subject).
the baby (is)   hungry
  Verbal predication may be either intransitive or transitive, intransitivity selecting
an intransitive verb as predicate and transitivity selecting a transitive verb with a
noun phrase object.

jarakati jiikauimi        mamputja
 Jarakati made            canoes
   Verbs meaning ‘give’ take two objects — direct and indirect, e.g. auikulani apakauai
murukuwutja joni tjajikatamanini ‘The old man gives the throwing stick to another
man.’
   Non-verbal predication, which is effected by mere juxtaposition, without a copula,
selects a noun, noun phrase, adjective or predicative as predicate and expresses one
of three different meanings — equational (x is y), possessive (x has y), and attributive
(x has the attribute y).","[75, 76]"
"1.1.1 Grammatical concepts
The grammatical categories which are expressed in the verb are as follows: person,
number, gender, tense, aspect, mood, voice, location/direction, time of day, stance,
emphasis. All verbs have to express person, number and (for third-person-singular)
gender of subject, and all transitive verbs have to express person, number, and
(for third-person-singular) gender of direct object. Tense is also an obligatory category
as subject prefixes generally carry a tense meaning as well, but verbs may remain
                                                                                    37unmarked for all the other categories. That is, there is an unmarked aspect, mood,
voice, etc., as well as a number of marked ones. The concepts in each of the categories
are stated below.
person: The system of person concepts is based on a two-dimensional scheme, one
dimension being inclusion or exclusion of the speaker(s) and the other inclusion or
exclusion of the person(s) addressed. This scheme yields a set of four persons, as
follows: first person, inclusive of speaker but exclusive of person addressed; second
person, exclusive of speaker but inclusive of person addressed; third person, exclusive
both of speaker and of person addressed; and fourth person, inclusive both of speaker
and of person addressed. The same system of persons is found both in the singular
and in the plural.
number: There are just two numbers — singular and plural — fourth person singular
being singular in the sense that there is just one speaker and one person addressed.
gender: There are just two genders — masculine and feminine. Entry into this system
is dependent on previous selection of third person and singular number.
tense: There are three tenses — non-past, past and future. The non-past tense has no
time reference in itself but may acquire present or future time reference from the
context.
aspect: There are six aspects—-unmarked, durative, repetitive, moving, beginning
and inceptive, and there is also the possibility of combining the concepts of duration,
repetition and movement, resulting in durative-repetitive and durative-repetitive-
moving verbs.
mood: In addition to an unmarked indicative mood, there are imperative, subjunctive,
compulsional and incompletive moods.
voice: The marked voices are reflexive, reciprocal, collective and causative.
location/direction: The system of location concepts is simply ‘there’ and ‘here’,
and the corresponding direction concepts are ‘from there’ ‘and from here’.
time of day: The time of day concepts are morning (up to about noon) and evening
(from late afternoon).
stance: The stance concepts are standing up and walking along.
emphasis: Emphasis is restricted to imperative verbs and contrasts just with lack
of emphasis.","[52, 53]"

Translation
When an old man is sick, he counts the days.! After three, four, five, six days, he
says to his wife, ‘Hey! You must go. Everyone will have to come. Everyone will
have to come.’2 ‘What for?’ ‘I’m going. I’m dying.’ The others go and tell them.
Everyone comes to his camp. ‘What, then?’ they ask. ‘You are welcome. I’m going.
I’m dying. I shan’t come back. I’m dying now. It’s for ever.’
   Then, ‘Wife,’ he says — ‘Yes,’ she says — ‘Give me some water.’ ‘What for?’
‘I’m going now. I’m dying.’3 ‘Oh.’ ‘But first I shall ask you, when I am dead, who
do you want to have you? How about so and so?’** ‘All right.’ ‘Well then, nephew,’
he says. ‘Yes,’ he answers. ‘Well then, brother-in-law, how about your sister?’ ‘Yes,’
he answers too.5 Then, ‘Well, give me some water, because I’m going now.’ She
gives him water and they all start crying. He is dead for ever. They wrap him in
stringy bark, take him away, and bury him.
  ‘You people here are not pukamani. These others are pukamani.'^ One month
goes past and then they dance.^ They make the grave posts.8 Five men go to make
them. No woman can come there. No, it’s much too sacred. There would be a lot
of trouble. Then they finish.^
                                                                                     IllExplanatory Notes
1 He counts the days he is sick. If he does not get better after five or six days he
  believes he will die.
2 The Tiwi think it proper for a big crowd of relations to be present when a man
  dies. Privacy is something almost unknown to them. Every important action in
  their life has to be conducted in public. The old man wants all his relations to
  to be present, first as a sign of his own importance, and secondly, to try and
  influpce their actions after his death by binding them with promises. The male
  relations want to be present at the death bed in order to demonstrate that the
  old man’s authority, and control over his women, has passed to them. Everyone
  jockeys for position and no one feels any real grief, although grief is simulated.
3 The Tiwi believe that a dying man’s life will depart through his mouth if he opens
  it wide to eat or drink. The old man asks for water as he does not wish to protract
  his dying indefinitely, but wants to get it over quickly and easily.
4 The main preoccupation of a Tiwi man’s life is to gain control over women.
  Even when he is dying, he still tries to influence the remarriage of his widows.
  The widows may be young and attractive, as Tiwi wives may easily be fifty or
  sixty years younger than their husbands, and, in any case, all are expected to
  remarry.
5 The old man asks his nephew-in-law and brother-in-law to see that his wishes
  about his wife’s remarriage are carried out. -piniwini (translated ‘nephew’ in the
  text) is the man with whom one exchanges sisters’ daughters. He is thus both
  one’s sister’s daughter’s husband and one’s wife’s mother’s brother, -nimini is
  the man with whom one exchanges younger sisters, and hence both one’s sister’s
  husband and one’s wife’s brother.
6 pukamani is the state of being of the close relations of a deceased person. In this
  state they are not allowed to touch food or take part in the preparations for the
  funeral ceremony. It is necessary to establish at once who is pukamani and who
  is not, as only the people who are not pukamani can make the posts and other
  objects needed for the grave, and organise the funeral ceremony.
1 A Tiwi funeral ceremony consists of a series of dances held over a period of several
  months, the first dance being held in the month following the death.
8 The grave posts are carved, painted posts, anything from five to fifteen feet high,
  which are stood in the ground round the grave.
^ The ceremony is finished when the final dance (called jiloti) has been held. This
  is not until several months after the death.","[125, 126, 127]"
"Explanatory Notes
1 The informant comes from Xik^la’ru, in western Bathurst Island, and evidently
   has very little knowledge of the geography of eastern Melville Island, where
   Purukupajli is supposed to have lived. The Melville Islanders place Purukupaili’s
   home not at Jaqainti (in north-east Melville Island) but at a place called Taulampi,
   near the eastern extremity of the island.
2 That is, Purukupajli looked after
3 That is, the sickness went right through Xitjani.
4 After her death as a woman, Waijai became the curlew.
5 Women do not hunt wallaby, of course, but gather crabs and oysters and
   vegetable foods such as yams and wild potatoes.
6 People in mourning enter a state called puijkdmwani in which they are not allowed
   to touch food. Waijai foresees that, when their son is dead, they will not be able
   to hunt and will have to be fed by their relations.
2 Xapara, Purukupajli’s younger brother and Waijai’s lover, became the moon
   after his fight with Purukupajli.
8 They met by previous arrangement, not by accident.
9 Waijai and X^para met to make love. The informant started to say that ‘those
   two were copulating’, but broke off and amended this to ‘those two were sitting
   on the grass’.
10 Purukupajli sang out that the baby Xipani was dead.
It That is, Purukupajli kept calling.
12 Waijai keeps calling out her own name in guilt and remorse. The name Waijai
   is evidently imitative of the cry of the curlew.
13 Xapara has to say ‘our son’, not ‘your son’, because, in the Tiwi kinship system,
   his relation to the child is the same as that of Purukupajli. That is, -mduani means
   both ‘son’ and ‘brother’s son’.
14 The Tiwi believe that Xapara, the moon, dies every month and comes back to
   life on the third day. In offering to bring X'Oani back to life he was offering eternal
   life to all men, but Purukupajli refused the offer and chose death for everyone.
15 Purukupajli hit Xapara in the eye.
15 ‘JwH, iuri, etc.’ represents Xapara’s cries of pain as he flew up into the sky and
   became the moon.
12 That is, Xapara went up.
18 Xipampunumi was the old Tiwi name for the Australian mainland, which they
   could just see from the eastern extremity of Melville Island. They believed it
   was the home of the dead.
19 There are certain shapes in the rock at Taulampi which the Tiwi believe to be the
   footprints of Purukupajli, made when he kept stamping his foot.
20 Certain   other rocks at Taulampi are believed to be Purukupajli’s fighting sticks.
21 The    baby X'nani died because, while his mother was away in the bush with
     Xapara, the shade in which she had left him moved around, and he was left lying
     in the hot sun.

86Translation
Long ago — long ago Maaimpunini spoke.i ‘All of you are to come tomorrow for
a meeting.’ ‘All right,’ said number two, er number two, er his younger brother.2
He answered his elder brother.
   Everyone came to Maaimpupini’s camp. They all sat down. ‘We have to exchange
women. We have to exchange women. Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law,’ he said.^
‘Yes?’ ‘I shall give you my sister. You will have to give me your sister. Nephew-
in-lawl’^ ‘Yes?’ he said. ‘Give me your sister’s daughter. I shall give you my sister’s
daughter. Then I shall give you . . . first I shall give you my sister.s Then, when
she has had a lot of babies, you will all have to give to one another.<5 You others
here — when my sister’s daughter has had many babies, you will have to exchange
for them. Give them your sisters’ daughters. Give them to your nephews-in-law.
And you must give one to me as well, so that, when I have got many daughters of
my own, I can give them to my sisters’ sons.”^ And then he — you will have your
mother-in-law.8 You will have your mother-in-law, man of the Red Ochre clan.
You man of the Red Ochre clan, you will have your mother-in-law. And you, man
of the Stingray clan, you too will have your mother-in-law. Just one. And I
Maiimpunini, I too shall have one mother-in-law. And you, man of the Flying Fox
clan, you too have one mother-in-law. Give to your sisters’ sons, you man of the
Flying Fox clan. Men of the Bird clan! You too are a group by yourself. You are
one big group — a totem — a clan. You are one clan. You are one totem. You
must exchange your younger sisters. You men of the Flying Fox clan, too, are one
totemic group.’
Explanatory Notes
1 Text 2 is concerned with the establishment of Tiwi marriage laws and totemic
  groups by Maaimpuijini (a small bird). Other texts suggest that Tokwampini
  (another small bird) also took some part in the establishment of these laws and
  groups, but the present text makes no mention of the part he played. The names
  Tokwampini and Maiimpunini do not refer to particular species but are both
  general names for unidentified small birds.
    There are twenty-one totemic groups — jimiija or pu'kwi as the Tiwi call them
  — and these are arranged in four large groups (only three in Majimpunini’s
  time, but a regrouping has occurred since then). Membership of the groups is
  by matrilineal descent and marriage is exogamous. A man usually marries his
  mother’s brother’s daughter (as she cannot possibly belong to the same totem
  as Ego), but, as the number of wives is unlimited, other wives are sought through
  a system of exchange. The usual thing is to exchange younger sisters or sisters’
  daughters with men of another totem (more strictly with men whose mothers
  and sisters are of a different totemic group from Ego).
     A full list of the totemic groups is given in the Thesaurus.
2 Apparently by ‘number two’ the informant meant Wujiuponila, ‘man of the
  Fire clan’.
3 Tiwi -nimini (here translated ‘brother-in-law’) is the man with whom one ex¬
  changes younger sisters. He is thus one’s wife’s brother and one’s sister’s husband.
   -piniwini (translated ‘nephew-in-law’) is the man with whom one exchanges
   sisters’ daughters. He is thus both one’s sister’s daughter’s husband and one’s
   wife’s mother’s brother.
5 MajimpuQini is here again speaking to his -nimini, of course.
<5 That is, when the man who gets Majimpuqini’s sister has a lot of daughters,
   he will have to give them away in exchange for other girls.
   It was usual to marry one’s mother’s brother’s daughter as she could not belong
   to the same totem as oneself.
8 Majimpurjini here starts to enunciate the totemic groups. As marriage is outside
   the group, and as membership of the group is by matrilineal descent, a Tiwi man
   has to know which women are his potential mothers-in-law.

1 The informant broke off the word pampaAitja, realising he had made a mistake.
2 At this point in the text the informant made noises suggestive of spitting Spitting
  in all directions is part of the ritual he is describing.
3 The informant broke off this word without saying the final suffix.","[100, 101, 102, 103, 104]"
"Explanatory Notes
1 Kuulama is the ceremony of the sacred yams, held every year in the wet season
  when the yams are ripe. The Tiwi believe that this ceremony was originated in
  the remote mythological past by Purikikini (a large species of owl), assisted to
  some extent by Toputupuni (a smaller owl). Other persons who were present
  at the first kuulama, according to the present text, were Jurukukuni (another
  species of owl), Jorokati (the white-breasted sea eagle), Tijinini (the red-backed
  sea eagle), and Joromo'ju (the wedge-tailed eagle). The ceremony, which has
  been described in more or less detail by a number of anthropologists including
  Spencer (1914), Brandi (1970), and Goodale (1970), is both an initiation ceremony
  and an increase ritual.
2 During their period of initiation the young men were not known by their personal
  names but by their initiation grade names, which were given them by Purikikini.
3 The kuulama boss needs plenty of yams as he is responsible for feeding all the
  people who come to the ceremony. The yams which are eaten as ordinary food
  are called muua^a, and it is these which the women are sent to get. The sacred
  kuulama yams can only be dug by men.
4 The kuulama boss sleeps alone in the bush for two nights in order to purify
  himself for the ceremony.
5 He throws fire in all directions and then spits in all directions. Presumably, the
  fire and water are imitative of sun and rain and are intended to persuade these
  to continue.
<5 ""Tijigini was still only watinijati — the third of the seven Tiwi initiation grades —
   and was thus not allowed to sing. The seven grades are mauikumauni, kdlipaunijati,
   watinijati, mikinatitja, mikintaua, mikitaprima, and mikitjkula. The Tiwi have
   a very low opinion of the red-backed sea eagle’s ability to catch fish, and this
   no doubt explains why he is placed so low in the initiation scale.
7 First the man sings by himself, then, when his wives and female relations have
  grasped the words of the song, they all join in, chanting in unison.
8 Owls are associated with kuulama because of their white faces, like the faces of
  people painted with white ochre.

1 Text 4 is only a small portion of a long narrative in which the informant wanders
  freely over much of Tiwi mythology. The rest of the material in this long narrative
  is omitted from the present collection of texts because of the informant’s un¬
  fortunate tendency to confuse the Tiwi myths with those of the Jiwadja people.
  The informant (Harry Carpenter) is half Jiwadja, and the two tribal cultures
  are very mixed up in his mind. Linguistically, however, his material is good Tiwi,
  and it is a pity that more of it could not be used.
2 lu-u'ui ji-na-ui-mari is ungrammatical as the two subject prefixes should agree
  in gender. It should read ju-u'ui ji-na-ui-mari (he went and got water), as
  Kujipurani (the subject of both verbs) is masculine. The third-person-singular
  past tense masculine subject prefix is ji- (variant ju-), except when there is a third-
  person-singular feminine direct object. In this case the feminine prefix ji- (variant
  ju-) is used as the subject prefix as it has the additional function of expressing
  gender of object. This explains why ji-i-maru-'ui pupkauipa, ‘He took the paper
  bark’, is grammatical, as the direct object, pupkauipa, is feminine.
 3 A portion of the text is omitted at this point as the informant wandered off onto
   another story.
 4 Another digression is omitted at this point.
 5 Another error of gender occurs in pa-tawa puuipjaripa, ‘the tree on top’.
   puuipjaripa, ‘tree’, is feminine and should have selected the feminine pronoun
   pi-tawa.","[105, 106, 107]"

   A number of points of linguistic interest emerge from a study of the figures:
(a) the overall incidence of y is very low. This provides factual support for the
view expressed in 1.1 that this phoneme is not a properly integrated member of
the system; (b) the functional load of / and t in word-initial position is relatively
low, compared with that of p or A:; (c) /, r, y and a rarely or never occur in word-
initial position; (d) the list-frequency figures for word-initial tj, n and // are very
low because of the restriction on their occurrence stated in 1.4. The text frequency
figures are considerably higher because of the initial occurrence of these phonemes
in several of the commonest personal pronouns and subject prefixes; (e) the non¬
initial figures for j are very low because of the difficulty of distinguishing this
phoneme intervocalically from a merely automatic glide between vowels. The
sequences written as ia, iu and ii could always be written as ija, iju and iji, respectively
(e.g., '^ia, T’, could be written '////a), and if this were done, the figures for non¬
initial j would be greatly increased.
                                                                                           17Vowels
The figures for the vowels give their frequency of occurrence in syllables with
primary word stress, in word-final unstressed syllables, and elsewhere. Stressed
position and word-final unstressed position are selected for study because these
are the only positions which are unaffected by the i-u neutralisation (see 1.3).
Because of this neutralisation it is impossible to give separate figures for i and u
in other positions.","[32, 33]"
"Translation
Long ago Purukupajli lived at Jaqajnti.i We call that country Jagaanti. Long ago.
His son, the little boy, his name was X*Oani — Purukupajli’s son. XilJani. Well
he became sick. He became sick. Then he looked after his son.2 He became really
ill. It went right through him.^ Then he said to Waijai his wife . . . Waijai . . . Long
ago Waijai — when she was a woman^ — well her name . . . her name . . . was Pima.
Pima was her name, Waijai the woman, Purukupajli’s wife.
    Then she said to her husband, ‘Hey!’ she said. ‘Yes?’ said Purukupajli. ‘I’m going
hunting for our food^, because we are hungry. When our son is dead we shall be
hungry.’^ So she went. Then Xapara""^ sneaked up there and those two met.® They
met, X^para and Waijai. Pima. They met, and those two — those two were sitting
on the grass, Waijai and Xapara.^
    He sang out that he was dead,ia that little boy Purukupajli’s son, dead. ‘Alas,
my dear wife, your son is no more,’ he kept saying. Then ‘Oh!’ she kept calling,
but he stopped her mouth. He stopped her mouth that Xapara. ‘Kwai! Kwai! Your
 son is dead,’ he kept calling.ii Then she came — she came — ‘Waijai! Waijai!
Waijai!’ she kept on calling.12 ‘Waijai! Waijai!’ Then Xapara too. Xapara came as
well.
    ‘Give me our son,’ he said.i3 ‘No.’ ‘Give me our son.’ ‘No.’ ‘Give me our son.
 In three days I shall make him well.’i^ ‘No. I shan’t give him to you. Now that
 my son is dead we shall all follow him. We shall all have to follow my son. No one
 will ever come back. Everyone will die.’ Purukupajli made that law. He was a hard
 man in what he said.
    He grabbed his throwing sticks — his forked throwing sticks. Purukupajli. He
 and his brother started fighting. He too had some forked throwing sticks, Xapara.
 They fought and fought and fought and fought until at last he hit him in the eye.is
 Purukupajli won the fight. He hit his brother in the eye. He kept hitting him with
 his fighting stick. Purukupajli won the fight. Then — ""T^ri, jiuri, Juri, j[uri, luri,

     Then, he grabbed his son, he grabbed him, that Xiljani. He took him — ‘We shall
 have to go to Xip^n^punumi.is We shall have to go to X'P^rnpunumi. No one will

mark there. He has his mark in the pits that he made. He has his mark. He lined
up his fighting sticks right through, grabbed his son, and took the dead body. The

   Dead body. He took that baby — Purukupaili took TiQ^ni — he took the dead
body lying in the sun.21 He took it. Then only the sea remained. Waijai came
running. She ran — ‘Waijai, Waijai, Waijai, my son, my son, my son, my son’ —
into the sea. She cried for a while. Then it was over. She was still.","[99, 100]"

1.1.2 Vowel system
The Tiwi vowel system, in common with that of a small number of other north
Australian languages, differs from the basic triangle generally found in Australia
by the possession of a fourth vowel, joj. The system is thus a quadrilateral based on
two dimensions of contrast and having the following vowel phonemes: a close
front unrounded vowel, ///; a close back rounded vowel, /«/; an open front un¬
rounded vowel, lal; and an open back rounded vowel, /o/.
                                       i               u
                                            a     0   The four vowels are shown in stressed position in the following examples:
I'ti^aj, ‘woman’, I'tu^aj, ‘basket’, I'tatjal, ‘Grab it!’ laun'torjil, ‘jabiru’.",[27]
"                                          NOTES
1. In questions about the identity of a person represented by a personal pronoun,
   this pronoun, not the interrogative, functions as subject, e.g. yipla kuwani?
   ‘Who (are) you?’ (literally ‘you who?’), not * kuwani ijinta?
2. kamini translates ‘what’ only in the sense ‘what thing’, e.g. kamini jipakauai?
   ‘What did he give him?’ ‘What’ in the sense ‘in what manner’ is translated
   au^ana, e.g. auyana tiimi? ‘What did you do?’ Note that ‘What’s your name?’
   is pip^a awjana jintapa? (literally ‘you how name’).
3. ‘Why?’ in isolation is translated not just kama? but pili kama? (‘for what?’).
   kama? does occur by itself, but then tends to mean something like ‘Well then,
   what about it?’.",[84]
"2   THE DESCRIPTION
The description is quite informal and is neither based on any of the well-known
models nor in fact an attempt to justify or demonstrate a model of any kind. Concepts
and techniques are drawn from a variety of theories just as they seem necessary,
the primary purpose throughout being the empirical one of describing the facts of
the language, not to use the language as a means of demonstrating a theory.
   The main influences on the work have been Boas-Sapir theory (for the basic
distinction between grammatical concepts and the formal devices which are used
to express them, and for the general mentalistic attitude to language which underlies
this distinction, see Boas 1911 and Sapir 1921); tagmemics (for the notion of
functional element used in the syntax, see Pike 1954 and Longacre 1964); trans¬
formational grammar (for the distinction between deep and surface structure, and
for the distinction between basic and non-basic structures and the use of trans¬
formation-type processes to derive the latter, see Chomsky 1957 and 1965); and
system-structure theory (for the distinction between transitivity and theme levels
used in explaining Tiwi word order, see Halliday 1967).
   The basic attitude underlying the whole work is mentalism — the belief that
language exists in the mind and that writing a grammar is the attempt to discover
and describe conceptual schemes and general principles underlying actual observable
linguistic forms. The form and arrangement of the description — beginning with
the phonemes and working up to the syntax — is dictated by the needs of exposition,
not by the writer’s theory of grammar. If the arrangement were based directly on
this theory it would be in the reverse order, beginning with meanings and ending
with the noises, but a description of a language can no more be the direct reflection
of a theory of competence than of a theory of performance. It has to take account
of the ways in which readers assimilate information.",[20]

1.     The grouping of the clans shown above is that which existed prior to 1945, not the
     present grouping. At some time since 1945 the following changes have been made,
     (a) arewiutuwl, wutuguwi and timdlawi have left Group I and formed a separate group of
     their own; (b) apjluluwi have moved from Group II to Group 111; (c) walikuwila have moved
     from Group III to Group II.
2. Many of the clans have alternative names: ardwujtuwi = takajirjuwi, wutupuwi =
   mutaijspila, tajnikuwi = muraijopila, timalawi = wilintuwila, t3m3rajiijuwi    ajikitojuwi,
  jajinapila =» kajBtuwi, wujapjawi = puijkwaripuwi, tokwampuwi = murupiapspila,
  puijaliwila =* pajuapujuwila, walikuwila = ku^aluwi = wujiupila, wajniijkituwi = kuwurawi,
  japaruwi = mujantuwila, lapijapuwi = kujlajampila.
3. The forms listed above are all plural forms. Masculine and feminine singular forms are
  obtained by replacing the plural suffix - Wi with either the masculine suffix -Ni or the feminine
  suflix -Ka; -tVi has morphologically conditioned variants -wi and -pi, -Ni has morpho¬
  logically conditioned variants -ni and -ti, and -Ka has morphologically conditioned variants
  -ija and -ka. Thus, for example, lilarini, ‘a man of the Brolga clan’, iilari^a, ‘a woman of
  the Brolga clan’, mantuupwani, ‘a man of the Fly clan’, mantuupwaka, ‘a woman of the
   Fly clan’.","[156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183]"
