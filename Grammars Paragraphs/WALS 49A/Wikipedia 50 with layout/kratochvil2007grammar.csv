3.2.2        Categorial indeterminacy
There are a number of ambiguous lexical items that are identified as nouns or verbs.
The ambiguity is resolved by the syntactic context in which the items occur. Consider
the form luuk in (8).(8)     a. he-luuk              do         he-feela      afenga     wi-d-a
              3II.INAL-dance PRX 3II.AL-friend be.other             be.like.MD.CPL-hold-DUR
              ‘his dance resembles his friend’s dance’                                [B07.053.03]
                                 GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                      71
       b. ama       luuk do         di ning      ayoku      de-meting       takai
           person dance PRX 3A be.QNT two                  3I.AL-betel.vine bite.CPL
           ‘while people were dancing, the two were eating their betel nut’    [B02.087.08:17]The lexical item luuk in (8) is identified a noun in (a) because it combines with the
possessive prefix and serves as an argument of the verb wida ‘become like that,
resemble’. In (b), the form is identified as a verb because it combines with a single
argument expressed with the noun ama ‘person’. In both cases the form luuk is
followed by the anaphoric demonstrative do that marks the end of a domain. In (a), do
(PRX) marks the end of an NP. In (b), it has a nominalising function, it marks the end of
a clause that serves as background information for the second clause.
        Another ambiguous item is tur, illustrated in (9). Both examples are taken from
a narrative. In (a), the form tur refers to a ‘spoon’ that fell out from the house and
must be picked up again. In (b), the form tur is used as a predicate ‘scoop up’ and
combines with the U argument is fat ma ‘cooked corn’.(9)    a. ah, na        sei               tur       mi=se         yo!

same form yaa is used in (b), where it refers to the activity of ‘going’.(10)   a. na      yaa     foka=ng      ha-fui-d-a
           1SG road be.big=see         3II.PAT-flat-hold-DUR

       b. a       kul     yaa!
           2SG must go
           ‘you must go’                                                         [B05.065.04]        Some more ambiguous lexical items are listed in (11)-(14). There is a semantic
relation between their two meanings in the sense that the noun refers to a U argument
of the verb in a very broad sense. The semantic relations may be described in pairs such
as undergoer/result-activity, instrument-activity, location-activity, and entity-property
(cf. Comrie and Thompson 1985:349)

an NP) or predicatively (as the head of a VP). The same categorial ambiguity is found
also by lexical items that are borrowed from Malay, as illustrated in (15). The two uses
of sakola display the location-activity relationship; tulusa displays the undergoer-
activity relationship:

             ‘school/school, teach’                               ‘writing/write’       As exemplified above, ambiguous items are identified as either noun or verb by
the syntactic and morphological context, in which they occur. The presented data
suggests that Abui sides with Austronesian languages in categorial indeterminacy and
not with Papuan (cf. Foley, 1998:509, 512; Himmelmann, 2005:126-131), which
normally have a strict division in nominal and verbal categories.1
3.2.3      Distributional properties
At the word level, nouns are characterized as either free or bound roots that may
combine with pronominal prefixes (for an overview of pronominal inventory, see
section 3.3). Pronominal prefixes serve to express possessors (for a detailed discussion
of possession, see section 4.2). Nominal morphology is restricted to the possessor
marking by pronominal prefixes. Other inflections such as for number, case, class, or
gender are not found in Abui.2
        Two free roots combined with pronominal prefixes are given in (16). The
pronominal prefixes belong to set I, glossed as AL(inenable) below. The free root feela
‘friend’ combines with pronominal prefix ne- (1SG.AL). The free root maama ‘father’
combines with pronominal prefix he- (3II.AL):(16)     ne-feela                ‘my friend’                         he-maama           ‘his father’
         1SG.AL-friend                                               3II.AL-fatherBound roots combine with pronominal prefixes from set III, glossed as INAL(ienable)
below. As illustrated in (17), the bound roots –táng ‘hand’ and wei ‘ear’ combine with
pronominal prefixes na- (1SG.INAL) and ha- (3II.INAL) respectively.(17)     na-táng                 ‘my hand’                           ha-wei             ‘his ear’
         1SG.INAL-hand                                               3II.INAL-earThere is a distinction between the nouns in (16) and (17). The nouns in (17) obligatorily
combine with the pronominal prefixes that express a possessor (see section 4.2.2). The
nouns in (16) combine optionally with pronominal prefixes (see section 4.2.3).
       Nouns never combine with pronominal prefixes from set II, glossed as
REC(ipient) below, which may only be attached to verbs. In (18), this restriction1 Categorical indeterminacy is a typical feature of Austronesian languages. As discussed by (Foley, 1998)Austronesian morphology is typified by the roots that ‘exhibit categorical indeterminacy, i.e. a given root can
be used nominally or verbally without derivation by being head of syntactically nominal or verbal
construction’ (Foley, 1998:509). However, ‘the roots in Papuan languages show a sharp division into nominal
and verbal categories and can only change via morphological derivation’ (Foley, 1998:512). Another Papuan
language that shows similar categorical indeterminacy is Sulka. This language has been in long-termed contact
with Austronesian languages (Reesink, 2005:145) which resulted in sharing the typological feature of
indeterminacy with AN languages (Reesink, 2005:163).
2 The lack of case and number inflection of nouns is claimed to be a common feature among other Papuanlanguages (Foley, 1986:93-96) as they rather employ verbal affixation to signal case relations.

disqualifies the ambiguous forms malaida, beka, fing, and kang in (b, d, f, h) to be
interpreted as nouns. The pronominal prefix belonging to set II identifies these lexemes
as verbs.(18)    a. ne-malaida                                 b. no-malaida

"        1.10 Outline of the grammar and the presentation of data
This book is organized as follows. In chapter 2, I give a description of the Abui
phonological system. Morphology and grammatical categories are given in chapter 3. In
chapter 4, nouns and noun phrases are described. Chapter 5 discusses argument
realization. Verb phrases and clauses are described in chapter 6. The final two chapters
focus on multi-verb constructions. In chapter 7, I describe complex verbs; chapter 8
gives an overview of serial verb constructions. In the appendixes, a number of texts are
given as well as Abui-English and English-Abui wordlists.
        Abui language data are presented in the following fashion, as illustrated in (22).

        In chapter 7, I discuss the morphology of Abui complex verbs. The verb stems
are split into segments that are glossed as generic verbs. These glosses are given only in
chapter 7. Elsewhere, I adopt simplified glossing as illustrated in the left-hand column.","[46, 47]"

         ‘it is he who has been hit by me; I hit him’ ‘it is he who hit me; he hit me’[Stokhof, 1987:647 ex.6]
18 This view was adopted by Stokhof (1981:127) who argues for the pronominal status of the forms like ne-do(1SG.EMPH) and identifies the -do following Capell (1975) as a ‘defining marker’ that ‘plays a role in
prominence organization of the utterance’. Stokhof distinguishes the -do pronominal forms like ne-do from -de
pronouns such as ne-de.
388                                             CHAPTER VIII
        Generic verb m may serve as a minor verb in SVCs encoding two grammatical
functions: (i) In instrumental SVCs it expresses the instrument participant as its U
argument; the human A argument is shared. It is glossed as ‘take’. (ii) In interior
location SVCs it expresses either the interior of objects such as ‘house’ or the interior
‘location’ of animates where cognitive and emotional processes take place, similar to
English ‘heart’ or Indonesian/Malay hati ‘liver’. In these constructions the verbal form
m ‘be in’ is nominalized as it serves often expresses a complement of the major verb.19
        The generic verb m ‘take, be in’ is not a proper prosodic word. Therefore it
mostly combines with the generic verb ì ‘put’ in a completive stem in both SVCs. The
completive stem mi ‘take, be in’ is possibly related to the deictic verb ma ‘be.PRX’
discussed in 8.4.4.1 and me ‘come’ (see 8.3.2.3, 8.4.6.2). In the following paragraphs
both functions of the minor verb mi ‘take, be in’ are discussed.
        INSTRUMENTAL SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The minor verb mi ‘take’ serves to
express the instrument, typically combining with two arguments. The A argument is
shared with the major verb, while the U argument expresses the instrument. An
example of an instrumental SVC is given in (122):(122) ama      kawen      mi bataa                    tukong
      person machete take wood                        cut
      ‘one cuts wood with a machete’The minor verb mi ‘take’ shares its A argument ama ‘person’ with tukong ‘cut’. Both
verbs have each their own U argument; mi ‘take’ combines with the U argument kawen
‘machete’, tukong ‘cut’ combines with bataa ‘wood’. The instrumental SVC is used as
valence-increasing device as the transitive mi adds the third argument to the
construction.
        The form mi has been grammaticalized on clausal level to a conjunction marker
establishing ‘instrument-like’ relationship between two clauses. In (123), the first clause
serves as a complement expressing the ‘instrument’ which caused the plate to be
broken. Note the form mi ‘take’ also occurs in instrumental SVC with the verb batek
‘throw, hit’. The U argument of the verb mi ‘take’ is da-táng ‘his arm’, the A argument
di (3A) is shared with the major verb.(123) [neng nuku di da-táng               mi                lik        tah-a=ng                 batek]CC

      ‘a man hit with his hand on the table’
19 Cognate verbs in other TAP languages express similar grammatical functions: in Adang there is a locativeverb mi ‘be at’ (cf. Haan; 2001);in Blagar mi is a locative postposition (Steinhauer, 1991:215), there is also an
inalienable noun -omi ‘inside’ (Steinhauer, 1991:215); in Kabola, there is a prefix mi that can attach to verbs to
derive applicative verbs (Stokhof, 1987:635), and a locative marker mi ‘be in’, however, this form displays
some verbal properties as it may combine with aspectual markers (cf. Stokhof, 1987:641,643); in Kaera, there
is a postposition mi serving as an oblique marker and a transitive verb ming ‘be at location’ (cf. Klamer, to
appear:21); in Klon mi is a verb meaning ‘be at’ or ‘place’ (cf. Baird, to appear:11), and has grammaticalized
uses as applicative marker and a conjunction.

example (124) where the minor verb mi ‘take’ combines with the major verb kaput
‘sew’. Note that the verb mi ‘take’ is also used in the second clause serialized with the
verb r ‘reach’ where the verbs ‘take’ and ‘reach’ refer to a transfer event involving three
participants.(124) [ne-konrek kirek-d-i]            hare, [na mi ne-ura                    he-r-i,]

       ‘my shirt got torn so I gave to my sister for sewing’                           [B05.068.01]The verb mi is part of a symmetrical SVC where the A argument of mi is shared with
the other verb. In the second clause, it is expressed with the free pronoun na (1SG). In
the third clause, it is expressed with the free pronoun di (3A) anaphoric to the NP ne-
ura ‘my sister’ The U argument of mi ‘take’ is in both cases the NP ne-konrek ‘my
shirt’ in the first clause. The minor verb ng ‘see’ in the third clause serves to express the
‘purpose’ of taking which is ‘sewing up’. In (125) a similar example is given:(125) yambuk nu           nu-mi             we-a         ba          ni    mi=ng         buuk

      ‘we want some glasses for drinking, to drink with’                               [B07.014.02]The verb mi ‘take’ combines with the A argument ni (1PL.E) that is shared with buuk
‘consume’. Both verbs combine in a symmetrical SVC. The minor verb ng ‘see’
encodes the purpose forming a prosodic word with mi. The verb mi ‘take’ combines
with the U argument yambuk nu ‘some glasses’ expressed in the first clause. The SVC
numi wea ‘we want’ is discussed in detail below.
        INTERIOR LOCATION SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The second function of the minor
verb m ‘be in’ is to express the interior location of either an animate or inanimate
participant. I will first discuss constructions where the verb m ‘be in’ serves to express
interior location of an animate participant. In these constructions, the minor verb m ‘be
in’ combines with two U arguments. The human experiencer participant is realized as
the U argument of the verb m ‘be in’ with the REC prefix. It is typically shared with the
major verb (V2). An example of an interior location SVC is given in (126) where the
minor verb m ‘be in’ combines with the major verb pang ‘feel’ to refer to ‘thinking’ as
‘feeling inside’. The REC prefix o- (2SG.REC) expresses the recipient of the ‘thought’. The

      ‘forgive us our trespasses, lit.: don’t think about our sins and wrong-doing’ [B07.012.04]In other Alorese languages there is a cognate form *om that is used to refer to the
location of emotion as ‘heart’. I will address the nominal properties of Abui
constructions with m/mi ‘be in’ further in this section.
       There is a large variety of constructions with mi ‘be in’ that refer to various
emotions and cognitive events. These constructions can be described with a number of
templates. In (127), the template consists of the verb mi ‘be in’ that is serialized with
the major verb describing the emotion or cognitive event. The REC prefix expresses the
experiencer that is optionally expressed with an NP or with a free pronoun. Note that
the major verb may combine with a U argument.","[410, 411, 412, 413]"
"Features of Abui morphology:     (i)      agglutinative morphological structure, elaborate verbal morphology
     (ii)     developed inflectional morphology (aspect, person)
     (iii)    prefixes for person inflection, suffixes for aspect inflection
     (iv)     nouns inflect only for possessor
     (v)      no case inflection of NPs, no gender
     (vi)     no agreement for subject/actor
     (vii)    verbs may combine with up to three bound aspectual markers (two
              suffixes, one clitic)
     (viii)   roots display categorial indeterminacy, sharp division only between
              prototypical nouns (persons) and verbsEvaluation: Abui nouns do not inflect for number nor are they classified for gender, as
is common in many Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:371-2). Nouns are classified
through posture verbs such as ‘stand’, ‘sit’ – long-shaped objects ‘stand’, flat-shaped
objects ‘lie’ etc. Such classification systems are well-known from some of the highland
languages (cf. Lang, 1975). There is no case in Abui, grammatical relations are signalled
with pronominal prefixes on the verb or by additional verbs employed in serial verb
construction. Abui has semantic alignment, a feature also found in other languages in
Eastern Indonesia, Papuan as well as Austronesian (cf. Klamer, To appear-a). Pronouns
in Abui show an inclusive/exclusive distinction, which is typical for Austronesian
languages, but rarely found among Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:376).
        Agglutinative morphological structure and elaborate verbal morphology are
typical TNG features, including the common distinction between ‘medial’ and ‘final’
verbs. In Abui, final verbs are typically fully inflected, medial verbs lack inflection.
While verbs in many TNG languages typically carry subject suffixes, Abui lacks such
subject suffixes. Instead, pronominal prefixes co-indexing undergoers are found, which
are common in many Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:378). Abui roots display a high
degree of categorial indeterminacy. It contrasts with the typical situation in Papuan
languages which make a sharp distinction between nouns and verbs, and in this respect
Abui sides with Austronesian languages that commonly display a high degree of
categorial indeterminacy (cf. Foley, 2000:370).
                                   INTRODUCTION                                       11
       As in other Papuan languages, Abui has a small class of verbs (referred to as
generic verbs in this study) that derive new verbs. This is a feature specific of Papuan
languages (cf. Foley, 2000:386). Generic verbs also frequently combine with other
verbs, and then function as auxiliaries. Abui has no ditransitive verbs and most verbs
may occur in both transitive and intransitive construction. These features are common
among Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:376-7).","[33, 34]"
"  8.4.7.1   SVC with kul ‘must’
The verb kul ‘must’ is used to express deontic modality. An example is given in (203)
where kul combines with a single A argument:(203) Floris di kul Petumbang               yaa-r-i
      name 3A must place                    go-COMPL-PFV
      ‘Floris had to go to Petumbang’                                     [B10.053.05]The verb kul ‘must’ may occur in different syntactic positions as illustrated in (204)
with a distinct reading. In (a) the modal follows the pronoun forming a contiguous SVC
with sakoladi ‘learn’ and encoding deontic modality. However, in (b) the NP is
extracted in pragmatic position and the A marking free pronoun di (3A) intervenes
between kul and sakoladi ‘learn’. This non-contiguous SVC encodes epistemic
modality:(204) a. moku fil-a             di kul sakola-d-i=se
         kid       be.young 3A must school-hold-PFV=INCP.I
         ‘the small child must learn’                                     [B10.053.08]
       b. moku       fila        kul    di sakola-d-i=se
           kid       be.young must 3A school-hold-PFV=INCP.I
           ‘the small child is certainly about to learn’                  [B10.053.08]In instances such as (b) kul may be considered to be an adverb. Note that adverbs are
mainly found preceding the A argument in the left edge of a clause or in the clause-
initial pragmatic position. In some cases they are preceded by focussed argument.
Another instance of kul ‘must’ displaying adverbial features is given in (205). Here kul
indicates epistemic modality; the dog is reported to be ‘certainly’ lost:(205) he-kaai        kul kupai tama=ng             nai-d-i
      3II.AL-dog must forest            sea=see    lost-hold-PFV
      ‘his dog certainly got lost in the forest’                          [B07.023.01]To express alethic modality kul can be used. The presence of the food is qualified as
logical necessity by the speaker in the following example where kul combines with du
that is here used to express that food has to ‘accompany’ or simply ‘be there’:(206) nala     ma do         kul ha-d-u
      what    ripe PRX must 3II.PAT-hold-PRF
      ‘there must be food, one has to eat’                                [B07.014.03]

   8.4.7.2   SVC with kang ‘be good’
The verb kang ‘be good’ indicates that an event ‘really’ happened. An example is given
in (207) where kang is serialized with wel ‘pour’.(207) di      kang            da-wel
      3A      be.good         3I.PAT-pour
      ‘he is bathing’                                                                        [B07.073.02]The verb kang occurs frequently in narratives to indicate that the reported events truly
happened. Constructions with kang occurred frequently in elicitations of the Man Tree
game. 23 In the following example taken from a narrative the water bucket is being
reported as truly getting empty:(208) ya       do     di kang          taka-d-i                        do
      water PRX 3A be.good             be.empty-hold-PFV               PRX
      ‘the water (bucket) was empty again’                                                [B02.135.04:05]In modal SVC of the type illustrated above, the verb kang combines exclusively with
third person arguments expressed obligatorily with the free pronoun di (3A) and an
optional NP. This serial construction is a source of the adverb dikang ‘again’, an
instance of its use is given in (209). I analyze the form dikang as an adverb ‘again’,
because the A argument is expressed with second person singular free pronoun a (2SG).
More details can be found in section 6.3.(209) kopi    a      dikang              ma-r=te
      coffee 2SG again                   ripe-reach=INCP.C
      ‘make some coffee again’                                                               [B10.013.01]
   8.4.7.3     SVC with ra/re ‘reach’
The verb ra/re ‘reach’ occurs in serial construction to express speaker’s intention to
perform some activity. Abui verb ‘reach’ has two alternating stems: the inceptive stem
re ‘reach, try’ refers to reaching or trying that has an initial point. This verb is also used
in aspectual SVC illustrated in 8.3.1.3. The continuative stem ra ‘reach, attempt’ is used
when the event of trying has not clear initial and final point, it has a reading of ‘reach’
or ‘attempt, persist’. The minor verb ra/re ‘reach’ usually occurs in A≡UPAT
experiencer construction (6.2.5.2), expressing a single participant with both free and
bound pronoun. Consider now (210):
23 Man-Tree game is a MPI elicitation tool designed to provide stimuli and help elicit spatial reference andnavigation apparatus of a language. Language consultants are presented each an identical set of photographs.
One of the consultants is to describe the photographs that consequently have to be correctly identified by the
other consultant.

         ‘he tries to leave (obligation)’          ‘he tries to leave (deliberately)’ [B05.045.01]The single participant is realized as an experiencer as free and bound pronoun with
single reference in (a). In (b) it is expressed only as a free pronoun. The minor verb ra
‘reach, attempt’ expresses speaker’s intention to ‘leave’. The use of the inceptive re
‘reach, try’ is illustrated in (211) where it combines with the verb natet-d-i ‘stand up,
get standing’:(211) a-re                 natet-d-i!
      2SG.PAT-reach.ICP    stand.up.CPL-hold-PFV
      ‘stand up!’                                                                 [B05.044.05]The continuative ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ indicates an event as being performed in a
persistent way. The single (human) participant is realized as the U argument with the
PAT prefix. Because the speaker mostly expresses his ‘wish’ to perform an activity, the
free pronoun is omitted and the A≡UPAT experiencer construction is alternated, as
illustrated in (212). In both cases the major verb is inflected with perfective suffix -i
(PFV) although the expressed situation must be considered as an instance of irrealis
mode (cf. Payne 1997:244):(212) a. na-ra                we-i    b.        a-ra                    na-pun-i

‘still’ and has many similarities with an adverbial modifier. In (a), the item still can be
interpreted as a verb; however, in (b), the predicate dara does not show person
agreement with the A argument na (1SG). The form functions as an adverbial modifier
(see 6.3).(213) a. di da-ra              nala nee         naha
         3A 3I.PAT-reach.CNT what eat           NEG

considering the restrictions on the use of the active pronouns with inanimates, it is
likely that the form dara in (214) is adverbial. It is quite obvious that the semantics of
the verb ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ can be easily extended to an adverbial use.

      ‘the thorn is still actually stuck in my foot’                            [B10.020.03]The verb ra ‘reach’ is sometimes used to refer to an event performed simultaneously by
more than one participant. In that case it combines with the distributive prefix ta-
(DISTR.PAT) that refers to the performing participants. The function of ra in such
instances is complex. It serves to introduce a multiple actor and indicates the realis
mode. Consider now the example (215):(215) Fan Malei ya        Fan Ata la            ta-ra                    de-kaai     bol

      ‘Fan Malei and Fan Ata each beat their dog there’                         [B07.076.02]In (215) ra combines with bol ‘hit’ sharing the multiple actor expressed with two proper
nouns Fan Malei and Fan Ata. These two participants are expressed as the U
argument of ra and also cross-referenced as the possessor of dekaai ‘their own dog’.
The SVC contains further the deictic verb la ‘be.MD’ indicating a ‘distant’ location of
the event. In some cases the whole minor verb might be reduplicated to indicate that
the participants perform the event simultaneously, but each of them on his own. This is
illustrated in (216) where ra combines with mok ‘bring together, pray’:(216) ta-ra-ta-ra                     mok
      RED[DISTR.PAT-reach.CNT]        bring.together
      ‘each prays on his own’                                                   [B04.019.03]Now compare the construction discussed in (215) with the construction given in (217).
Here the boys Fan Malei and Fan Ata beat simultaneously each his own dog. That
means that more than one dog is being beaten, while in (215) their single dog was
maltreated:(217) Fan Malei ya        Fan Ata ta-ra-ta-ra                       de-kaai bol
      name         SEQ name           RED[DISTR.PAT-reach.CNT] 3I.AL-dog hit
      ‘Fan Malei with Fan Ata beat each his dog on his own (different place, way)’ [B07.076.02]Also in this case the reduplication of the minor verb ra indicates that the participants
act simultaneously but each of them upon another undergoer.
                       Appendix: Abui texts
In this section I present a number of Abui texts. The first text is an ancestor story of
the Aila clan la teitu nikalieta. The second and third text are two fables about the
monkey and the turtle titled luka-luka ya yoikoi. The fourth text is the Abui version of
the Lord’s Prayer. The sixth text moku mayol is a description of a traditional bride
price negotiations and marriage. In the transcriptions I use the comma symbol to mark
a pause in intonation, longer pauses (where the speaker is thinking) are marked with the
plus symbol +, long pauses that mark the end of a discourse unit are marked with the
number sign #. Malay loans are given in bold case.                    la teitu nikalieta (ancestor story of Aila clan)
This story describes the ancestry and origin of the Aila clan that is a part of the
Takalelang village. The common ancestor of Aila clan is claimed to originate from the
Munaseli area of the neighbouring island Pantar. After an internal conflict some of the
ancestors left Munaseli and came up to Likwatang area.1 Having cultivated some areas
they came in contact with the original (Non-Austronesian) Abui speaking population
settled in Kewai above in the mountains. The mountain people did not have iron tools
and therefore they allowed the Aila people to stay and demanded iron tools from
them.2 After a conflict the Aila ancestors had to escape; one of the two brothers was
killed, while the other one managed to escape and built a village. Although he was
paying a tribute to the Kewai, his village was attacked and burnt down. Only a couple
managed to escape. The woman was pregnant; she gave birth to a child and was taken
back by her family. The Aila clan members count their origin from her. In the recent
past they were summoned by the government and the church to come down from their
village on the mountain top and move to the new settlement Kameng Taha. The
relocation of the village happened during the lifetime of the old story-teller Alfred
Maufani. His ironic allusions describe the relocation as a well-meant intention of the
government and the church to let everybody dwell in peace together. The style of the
story is rich with frequent parallelisms and direct speech, and frequent resuming of the
previous (tail head linkage). The number of Malay loans is very limited.","[437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442]"

refer to them as [N-modifier noun] NPs. There are two pieces of evidence to analyze
these structures as NPs. First, in syntactic operations, the [N-modifier noun] structures
can be separated; they are not a single unit as compounds. As illustrated in (69), the
head of the [N-modifier noun] NP wil neng ‘son’ can occur as a bare NP wil ‘child’ in
the following clause.(69)   kalieta         neng nuku ai          bikil miei          ya      faling   mi     ya

       ‘one old man came from the left side and gave an axe to his son, his child took it and cut
       the firewood’                                              [B06.073.MPI160MW]Because the right constituent is omitted and the left constituent re-occurs, the left
constituent must be the head and in consequence the structures as wil neng ‘son’ are
NPs. In contrast, compounds are right-headed structures that are lexicalized; their
internal structure is not ‘visible’ for syntactic operations and none of the constituents
may be omitted.
        The second piece of evidence is comes from morphology. Consider the
structure wil neng ‘son’ (lit.: ‘child man’) in (70). In (a), this structure combines with
possessive inflection. In (b, c), the possessive marking appears on each of the nouns
wil ‘child’ and neng ‘man’ independently. The meaning of the possessed structure ne-
wil neng ‘my son’ corresponds to ne-wil ‘my child’ and not to ne-neng ‘my husband’.
From this we can conclude that the structure wil neng ‘son’ is left-headed and
therefore an NP.

denote substances rather than well-defined objects. These nouns typically combine with
modifier nouns that specify their shape and size. In enumeration, the modifier noun
typically co-occurs with the quantifier because the head noun is not sufficiently
individuated to be quantified (see also 4.4.4.1). This is illustrated in (72), where the head
noun seng ‘money’ combines with two modifier nouns that specify the shape of the
‘money’ substance. The banknotes are referred to as watala ‘leaves’, while for coins the
modifier noun tipai ‘iron’ is used to indicate the material from which this type of
money is made. Note that both NPs refer to a type of money and not to a type of
leaves or iron, which would be the case if these structures were compounds.(72)   seng     watala                                        seng      tipai

various shapes. These NPs contrast with compounds listed in (44)-(45).(73)   ía       upi              ía         kasing            war kasing

4.4.2     Verbs and Adjectives
In an NP, stative verbs and adjectives serve to specify some property of the head noun
(cf. Payne 1997:63). As illustrated in (75), stative verbs and adjectives follow the head
noun. In (a), the adjective kul ‘white’ follows the head noun kaai ‘dog’, as well as the
stative verbs kiding ‘small’, foka ‘big’ and fila ‘young’ in (b-d):(75)    a. kaai kul                                                b. fala   kiding
            dog white                                                 house small
            ‘white dog’                                               ‘small house’
        c. bataa      foka                                         d. moku      fila
            wood       be.big                                         kid         be.young
            ‘big tree’                                                ‘little child’As discussed in section 3.5.1, adjectives are syntactically differentiated from stative
verbs. Both grammatical categories may serve as modifiers in an NP, but stative verbs
may also serve as a head of a VP and combine with a single argument. In Abui,
arguments always precede the verb, which means that a structure consisting of a noun
followed by a stative verb is ambiguous and may be interpreted either as an NP or as a
VP. On the other hand, the adjectives cannot be used as predicates, heading a VP.
These properties are summarized in Table 18:                    Table 18: Distributional properties of adjectives and stative verbs
                      GRAMMATICAL CATEGORY NP DOMAIN VP DOMAIN                                 ADJECTIVE               Modifier            *
                                STATIVE VERB             Modifier        PredicateThe functional asymmetry between adjectives and stative verbs has a consequence, that
only the structures consisting of a noun followed by an adjective are unambiguous NPs.
This restricted functional property of a noun phrase with an adjectival modifier is
further exemplified in (76). In (a, d, g) the adjective modifier of the noun phrase has an
attributive function, but as illustrated in (b, e, h) it does not have a predicative function.
Instead a complex verb must be used that incorporates the adjectival element:

       i. baleei      san-r-i
           banana clean-reach-PFV
           ‘the banana is ripe’As discussed in section 3.5.1, the grammatical category of adjectives is closed; it
contains only six items. The set of stative verbs is much larger, as shown in section
3.4.4.8. Therefore most NPs that contain an attributive modifier are ambiguous.
Structures that consist of a single noun and a stative verb may be interpreted non-
predicatively as an NP or predicatively consisting of a stative verb combined with a
single argument realized as a bare NP. This ambiguity is illustrated in (77). The
structure consisting of the noun ama ‘person’ and the stative verb tukoi ‘be strong’ is
ambiguous and can be interpreted either as an NP (a) or as N + VP (b).(77)   a. ama         tukoi                           b. ama         tukoi
           person be.strong                               person be.strong
           ‘strong person’                                ‘the person is strong’Structures similar to those in (77) are disambiguated when another NP-domain
constituent is present. This is illustrated in (78), where the numeral nuku ‘one’ follows
the stative verb bui ‘be short’. In Abui, numerals may not modify verbs and therefore
the structure in (b) is identified as an NP. Another constituent that occurs exclusively in
NP domain is the plural quantifier loku (PL). In (d), its presence identifies the given
structure as an NP.(78)   a. lui         bui                             b. lui         bui          nuku
           knife     be.short                             knife     be.short one
           ‘short knife’ or ‘the knife is short’          ‘one short knife’

           ‘first wife’ or ‘the woman is eldest’          ‘the first wives’As illustrated in (78), the quantifiers nuku ‘one’ and loku (PL) follow the stative verb.
More details about the NP syntax dealing with more than one modifier can be found in
section 4.4.5.
        There are cases, where an NP containing a stative verb seems lexicalized. In
(79), the head noun ama ‘person’ combines with a stative verb. The noun ama ‘person’

may occur independently referring to an unspecified human being. The noun ama
‘person’ combines with the stative verb kang ‘be good’ to refer neutrally to a human
being, as also illustrated in (80). The stative verb kang ‘be good’ can be alternated with
the stative verb beka ‘be bad’, but in that case, the NP has a negative connotation of a
‘bad guy’.(79)    ama         kang                                  ama       beka

        ‘person, guy’                                     ‘bad guy, villain’The NP ama kang ‘person, guy’ seems lexicalized. It is typically used to refer to
inhabitants of a village or area. Note that area is referred to as a possessor of the noun
ama ‘person’ with the possessive prefix he- (3II.AL).","[179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"

this case no actual ‘holding’ occurs, as the people are only ‘driving out’ the deer. In the

‘hold, get’ is to express a participant attributed a certain property. This SVC will be
referred to as ‘attributive’. The attributed participant is realized as the U argument of
the minor verb d ‘hold, get’ with LOC prefix in an ULOC intransitive construction (see
6.2.4.3). The minor verb is inflected with the punctual suffix -o (PNCT)The major verb
expressing the attribute belongs to the stative-verb, positional-verb, and index-verb
class. Consider now (109) where the stative verb kawaisa ‘be rich’ is illustrated.(109) a. e-d-o                kawaisa                          b. *a     kawaisa

illustrated in (b), as only participants identified for actor role may be realized with a free
pronoun. Instead the attributive SVC must be used, given in (a). The participant is
realized as the U argument of the minor verb do ‘hold, get’ with the LOC prefix. This
holds for the speech participants, expressed with the first and second person. Third
person participants are either expressed as a NP in simple monoverbal clause (d) or as a
bound pronoun in attributive SVC (c). In (110), the verb do ‘hold’ is serialized with the
locational verb mi-a ‘be in’.(110) di sei                 he-d-o                    mi-a       ba     ha-kil

positional-verb, and index-verb class. However, the attributive serial construction may
be used in combination with major verbs that typically occur in U intransitive
constructions such as -rik ‘hurt, be ill’, as illustrated in (112).(112) ne-d-o            na-rik

of the attributive SVC. In narrow-focus construction the domain of the focus is limited
to a single constituent, in this case one of the arguments. The normal position of the
focused constituent is preceding the minor verb d ‘hold, get’. It is expressed as the U
argument with the LOC prefix in an ULOC intransitive construction (see 6.2.4.3). The
minor verb combines either with the punctual suffix -o (PNCT), or with the imperfective
suffix -e (IPFV). These combinations are phonologically required as the generic root d
‘hold, get’ is not a prosodic word. An example with the minor verb d-o is given in
(114):(114) e-d-o                     taa, ne-d-o               na-rui-d-a

realized with the LOC prefix. The same holds for the second clause where the verbs do
‘hold, get’ and ruida ‘wake up’ are serialized. The connection with the attributive SVC
is still quite obvious. Compare now the previous construction with a parallel
construction in (115) where both participants are not under focus but are expressed
with a free pronoun. Observe also the use of the serial construction with ng ‘see’ to
express the participant of ‘waking up’ (8.4.2.1).(115) a      taa, na=ng          na-rui-d-a

The minor verb d-e ‘hold, get’ is used to focus on an actor constituent stressing that the
actor is still to perform an event. As illustrated in (116), the focused participant is
expressed with the LOC prefix on d-e ‘hold’. This argument shared with the major verbs
mara ‘go up’ and mia ‘take’.(116) ne-feela,            ma         e-de                     mara             mi-a          re

clause.16 This position is marked by an pause in intonation that follows the focussed
constituent. This pragmatic structure may interact with the focus SVC. The minor verb
and its U argument are extracted from the core of the clause (realized as contiguous
SVC) and placed in the clause-initial pragmatic position. An NP can be extracted to the
focus position without leaving any pronominal trace. This is illustrated in (117) where
the NP kawen ‘machete’ occurs clause-initially.(117) kawen     ama       mi bataa                  tukong

pragmatic position and also in its original position. An example of such construction is
given in (118):(118) [ne-d-o,]nominal     na pa                          pi-afu          tahai       yo

focus pronoun, just like the form ne-d-e. The pause in intonation between nedo and na
in (118) may be used as evidence supporting such an analysis.17 In my analysis, I choose16 The left edge of the clause is a typical location of focussed constituent also in other Papuan languages, as
argued by Donohue (2005:187).
17 In fact, a similar construction occurs in the neighbouring language Kabola (cf. Stokhof: 1987:647) where apronoun combined with a morpheme -ri, which is analyzed as a case marker, may be fronted to a pragmatic
position as illustrated in (2). Interestingly, the morpheme -ri may be combined with the inceptive aspectual
marker so.

Example (3) illustrates that an interesting alternation in Kabola. The accusative case marker can be replaced
with the morpheme ng, which is not further specified for its meaning. In both cases, the inceptive aspect
marker so is obligatory.

for the analogy between the attributive SVC and focus construction and analyse the
form ne-d-o as a verb phrase that appears in the clause-initial pragmatic position. As
illustrated in (119), the pragmatic position has a nominalising effect on the verb phrase
occurring in it. The pragmatic position marks any constituent appearing in it as given.
The resulting nominal ne-d-o has a lot in common with pronouns. The pragmatic
position does not allow free pronouns, which cannot be extracted from the clause.(119) [ne-d-o,]nominal      na       yaa buku afenga=ng yaa,                      melang afenga= ng

Also in this fragment, the fronted VP seems nominalized and is marked by a pause in
intonation as being located in the pragmatic position. The nominalized VP e-d-o is
followed by the free pronoun a (2SG).(120) eh, Karfe Hawa-e, [e-d-o,]nominal         a te-salimang-d-i-a             do!

pragmatic position. The stem do ‘hold’ should not be confused with the anaphoric
demonstrative do (PRX), as illustrated in (121). Anaphoric demonstratives do not
combine with pronominal prefixes, unlike nouns, verbs and numerals.18(121) a. [he-d-o,]nominal   di ayong                        b. *he-do,               di ayong

   8.4.2.3     SVC with m ‘take, be in’
The generic verb m is glossed either as ‘take’ or ‘be in’ depending on the grammatical
context in which it is used. The decisive factors are the type and animacy value of its
arguments. In contexts where the minor verb combines with an animate A argument it
is glossed as ‘take’, in other contexts as ‘be in’.","[406, 407, 408, 409, 410]"
"(106) {PREFIX.2-        [PREFIX.1-BOUND.VERB.STEM]V}VP
             INCORPORATED.ARGUMENT
In all presented cases, the incorporated argument was preceded either by a REC or LOC
prefix. In case of bound verb stems, this argument was co-indexed with the PAT prefix.
This suggests that only the arguments with semantic role of patient or theme may be
incorporated.
        Abui PAT and LOC prefixes are polysemous; they also mark possessor. Instances
such as (107) are not analyzed as argument incorporation, because the possessive
function is also available and less complex than argument incorporation. Observe, that
the prefix de- that is attached to the NP kuya ‘bird’ expresses the possessor. However,
because of the benefactive-possessive polysemy found in Abui (cf. Lichtenberk, 2002;
Margetts, 2004), this construction has a benefactive reading.

             3 Grammatical Categories
In this chapter, I describe Abui grammatical categories. Grammatical categories are
sometimes referred to as ‘part-of-speech classes’; they are the building blocks of
linguistic structures. Grammatical categories are either open or closed. Open categories
contain a virtually unlimited number of items, while closed categories have a limited set
of members. In Abui, open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed
grammatical categories are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers,
adverbs and question words.
        In Abui, many lexical items appear to be ambiguous. Their categorial
membership must be determined by the combination of their distributional, functional,
and semantic properties (cf. Schachter, 1985; Andward et al., 1997). With the term
‘distributional properties’ I refer to the word-internal (morphological) and word-
external (syntactic) distribution of an item. In section 3.1, I give an overview of Abui
morphology describing various morpheme types (bound, free, prefixes, suffixes, roots,
and stems).
        Word-external (syntactic) distributional properties refer to the status of items in
syntactic units such as phrases, clauses and sentences. Items may be restricted in their
distribution within syntactic units; not all items may occur as heads. Items have
different functional properties. They can express various grammatical functions such as
arguments, aspectual markers, or linkers. Finally, items can have a different type of
reference (time-stable or versatile) and different referents (persons, events, etc.).
        In section 3.2, I describe nouns. Nouns are items that canonically refer to time-
stable concepts such as persons, objects or places. The nominal reference is permanent.
Pronouns are discussed in section 3.3. Pronouns refer to time-stable concepts,
however, their reference is not permanent as the nominal reference but versatile and
context dependent. In section 3.4, I discuss Abui verbs. Verbs are defined
morphologically as items that may combine with REC pronominal prefix and aspectual
markers. Syntactically, they are the head of a verb phrase. Verbs serve as predicates in a
clause and may combine with arguments.
        The remainder of this chapter gives an overview of closed grammatical
categories; they are discussed in section 3.5. The closed grammatical categories are
adjectives (3.5.1), demonstratives (3.5.2), quantifiers (3.5.3), aspectual markers (3.5.4),
conjunction markers (3.5.6), adverbs (3.5.5), and question words (3.5.7).","[88, 89, 90]"

      AcknowledgementsThis book is a linguistic account of an amazing journey. As a small boy I used to hear
stories about Indonesia from my father’s friend who worked there and found it the
most beautiful place on Earth. Later, during my studies in Nijmegen, I took courses in
Indonesian and fieldwork methods, and became convinced that I could travel to those
remote islands myself and describe a language.
        The first step of this journey started in Leiden in 2002. My whole-hearted
thanks belong to those who guided me patiently along the journey, and whom, as the
tradition dictates, I may not name.
        Many people accompanied me as the journey unfolded. In Leiden, I owe thanks
to my colleagues at Leiden University Centre for Linguistics for teaching, reading,
listening, good friendship, joyful company, culinary treats, and any possible
combination of these. They are Alwin Kloekhorst, Amir Tauber, Anikó Liptak, Aone

Vincent van Heuven. I would also like to thank Nelleke Goudswaard and Wilco van
den Heuvel for taking care of practical issues concerning language description.
        In Indonesia, I found hospitality and friends in many places. I thank Uri
Tadmor for sharing his fine home in Jakarta and his colleagues at MPI Field station,
Antonia Soriente and Betty Litamahuputty for a fine company. I am pleased to
acknowledge the official support that I have received from MPI Field station Jakarta
and in particular from Dr. Uri Tadmor as well as from Universitas Atma Jaya, Jakarta
and in particular from Professor Bambang Kaswanti Purwo. I owe many thanks to
Andreas Wijaya, Obing Katubi, Anisah Kortshak, Yunus Riadi Herman, Arnoldus Arif
Kusuma for their friendship and merry company and to Dani Martati for her delicious
cooking and care.
        In Kupang, June Jacob, John Haan, Flori Lake, Christo and Ben always helped
me around. Universitas Kristen Arthawacana Kupang supported my research. When I
stayed with Madah Biha’s family, it felt like home. I also thank Bapak Arkilaus Sabu and
Elias Ndiwa and their families for their great hospitality.
        Once the journey reached Alor, Karsten van der Oord introduced me to the
family of Chris Dani, who looked after me in Kalabahi and shared their home and
delicious food. Karsten took me out for diving, bought me strong liquors, told me a lot
about Alor and taught me how to chew betel nut. Sister Christa, Sister Gisela, Romo
Polce and Romo Toni showed me the pure and humble face of christianity. Many
thanks are directed to Andreas Malaikosa and Neil Johnston from SIL branch Alor. I
also thank Daniel Bekak and Ans Takalapeta who supported my research in Alor.

        Karsten van der Oord introduced me to Timoteus, Amalia, Dori, Orpa and
Simon Lanma, who took me in their family and treated me as their own. They taught
me their ‘straight’ language, as they call it. They took care of me in times of illness and
discomfort and made me laugh on so many occasions. I thank Benidiktus Delpada and
Waksi Maufani, who carried the daily linguistic burden with me, and they carried it so
well. I thank my little friends Fani, Fan Ata, Eman, Simon-Kakak, Lon-Rut, Orpa, and
Peni for taking me for trips to the jungle and teaching me so many things. I also thank
Nelis, Eben, Ande, Loni, Hilde, Nani, Lon Fan for being good villagers. I thank Bapak
Penku, Bapak Vinsen, Bapak Maiku, Bapak Aliku, Bapak Ande, Bapa Elias, and many
others for sharing their stories and language with me. They were tried to teach me the
‘straight’ Abui, but I am afraid it is still quite twisted.
        The first two trips I made together with Louise Baird and Peter Newman. They
looked after me in many ways wherever I went or stayed: in Leiden, Indonesia, and
Australia. Louise was a frustratingly hard-working officemate and a wonderful
colleague.
        In Australia, I am grateful to Bill Foley for valuable comments on many matters,
especially on generic verbs. I thank Andrew Pawley for his support and sharing his
knowledge. John Hajek helped me with Abui tones. I also thank John Bowden, Mark
Donohue and Gary Holton.
        Along the journey, I met my paranymph Floris Scheplitz. Floris accompanied
me on my last trip to Alor, conducting his own ethnobotanic research. It was a true
pleasure having him and Marloes around. I was blessed with the company of the
gentlemen Freek Otte, Eric Thomassen, Martin Vink, Frank de Wever, and Fred
Hamburg, with whom I spent many hours in De Bonte Koe and De Burcht, discussing
sacral and secular issues passionately. I thank Lewis Mayo, Julian Millie, Rati and Joe,
Ivana Hladká, Gershon Kaigere for their cheerful company and many nice dinners.
        I would like to thank my old friends Gerard van Poppel, Jasper van der Weerd,
the late Sjef van Tilborg, Tim Sparla, Tom Willems, Ineke de Kort, Lisette Crooijmans,
Kees van Dongen and Mieke Hoedemakers (with Berend and Willem) in Nijmegen;
Roy van Rijt en Hilde Beurskens in Haelen; Klaas en Anja Visser in Beemster; Kitty,
Marino, Sjoerd (and octopuses), Tijs, and Bas in Rijen; Kamila Krupičková, Johan
Deknopper, Fred Stroobants in Belgium, Martijn Cooijmans in London; and Tomáš
Langášek and Michal Kramář in the Czech Republic, for always being there even when
I was not there. Reinoud, Rienje and Jan visited me in Takalelang and cooked me plenty
good dinners. Thomas made it to Alor only in the belly, but was our companion in all
the following adventures.
        The Eastern European connection was taken care of by Boban Arsenijević, my
second paranymph, and his graceous company Dunce and Lidija. He appreciates
generic verbs, slivowitz, absurdity and melodramatic sentiment and knows that without
these, one gets easily lost, being far from one’s homeland.
        Joanna Sio became another eastern connection. She taught me to appreciate
general knowlegde, food-related metaphors and convinced me to move to Hong Kong.
Joanna helped me through the last months of writing this book.
        At the end of a proper journey, one should go home. I thank my family in the
Czech Republic for allowing me to go and learn that villages on the other side of this
planet are not that different from Dobroutov, the little village where we come from. I
remember those who passed away while I was not there.

                            1 Introduction
This book is a description of Abui, a Papuan language spoken on Alor Island in eastern
Indonesia. It presents essential parts of Abui grammar in a theoretically neutral way.
        This chapter contains some general information about Abui, its speakers and the
area in which Abui is spoken. This chapter is organised in the following fashion. The
geographic position of the area where Abui is spoken is defined in section 1.1. The
genetic affiliation of Abui, together with a brief overview of the historical sources
concerning Alor Island and Abui people, is discussed in section 1.2. In section 1.3 I
give some general information about the Abui community, the number of speakers,
their typical occupation and way of living. The linguistic situation of the area where
Abui is spoken is described in section 1.4. Information about the contexts in which
Abui is used and about language endangerment will also be included in this section. In
section 1.5 I give an overview of previous linguistic efforts focused on Abui; and in 1.6
I discuss Abui genetic affiliation. I present a typological sketch of Abui in section 1.7.
Section 1.8 discusses how the language data was collected. It describes the fieldwork
and gives some basic information about the language consultants. Section 1.9 deals with
composition of the corpus and gives a list of recorded texts that are included in it.
Section 1.10 gives an outline of this book and introduces the conventions in which the
language data will be presented.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"  4.4.4.1    Numeral quantifiers
A number of NPs with numeral quantifiers are given in (85). In all cases the numeral
follows the head noun:(85)    mayol      nuku                   bal    ayoku                        war buti
        woman    one                      ball two                            sun four
        ‘one woman’                       ‘two balls’                         ‘four days’In (86), I illustrate the use of numeral quantifiers in context.

well-defined objects. In quantified NPs, these nouns combine with modifier nouns that
specify their shape and size in order to be enumerated. In their function, modifier
nouns are very much like classifiers. The modifier noun bika ‘kernel’ co-occurs in
enumeration with nouns denoting smallish round objects, as illustrated in (87).(87)   na-wet               bika nuku                    h-ièng          bika         ayoku

       ‘one tooth of mine’                               ‘his two eyes’The noun kasing ‘splinter’ is used in enumeration of flat shaped objects:(88)   kabala kasing          kar-nuku              faala kasing nuku
       cloth    splinter     ten-one                slab splinter one
       ‘ten pieces of cloth’                        ‘one slab (on the poles of the house)’The modifier nouns may also appear in enumeration of human and animal referents to
indicate generic (non-specific) reference. In (89), the nouns moku ‘kid’ , fe ‘pig’, ama
kang ‘person’, and ura ‘sibling’ combine with the modifier noun upi ‘fruit’ to refer to a
number of unspecified referents.(89)   moku        upi      talaama                      fe      upi     talaama

       ama      kang          upi     sua                he-ura                 upi    ayoku

       ‘three people’                                    ‘her two brothers/his two sisters’In some cases, an NP containing a numeral quantifier seems lexicalized. An instance is
given in (90), where the head noun toku ‘leg’ combines with numerals ayoku ‘two’ and
buti ‘four’. The NP refers to two- and four-legged domestic animals.(90)   he-toku ayoku          buti
       3II.AL-leg two         four
       ‘domestic animals’

  4.4.4.2     Non-numeral quantifiers
A fuzzy quantity of the referent is expressed by non-numeral quantifiers (see also
section 3.5.3.2). Non-numeral quantifiers follow the head noun. There are three non-
numeral quantifiers that will be discussed here; the plural quantifier loku (PL), the
quantifier kabei ‘few, little’ and faring ‘much, many’.
       The quantifier loku expresses the plural quantity and is glossed as (PL). The
quantifier loku (PL) can never be followed by a numeral, which proves that it is not an
instance of plural inflection but a plural quantifier. It combines with referents that are
countable and individuated; such referents are mostly human. The meaning of the
quantifier loku (PL) can be translated with ‘many’ or ‘several’ or with a plural form of
the modified noun; nevertheless, these translations seem to be less felicitous as glosses.
A number of examples are given in (91):(91)   neng     loku                               ruwol        loku
       man     PL                                  chicken     PL
       ‘the men’                                   ‘the chicken’
       he-pet       he-pulang        loku          namang loku
       3II.AL-bow 3II.AL-arrow PL                  clothes      PL
       ‘his armour, his bows and arrows’           ‘(various) clothes’In the clause given in (92), the A argument of the verb sei ‘come down’ is expressed
with the NP moku loku. The head noun moku ‘kid’ is quantified with loku (PL).(92)   moku loku sakola              he-sei
       kid       PL    school     3II.LOC-come.down.CNT
       ‘the children come down for school’                                  [B03.003.02]In (93), the quantifier loku (PL) occurs with the noun fe ‘pig’ in (a). It was used in a
situation where the speaker referred to four pigs. In (b), the noun fír ‘star’ is combined
with loku (PL) to mean a high number of stars. Clearly, the quantifier loku (PL)
indicates “more than one”.(93)   a. fe      loku                                  b. fír       loku
           pig    PL                                          star PL
           ‘pigs’                                             ‘stars’In (94), the quantifier loku (PL) combines with proper names that refer to persons,
groups, or areas. However, the NPs that consist of these nouns and the quantifier loku
(PL) do not simply refer to the plural number of these referents but to a group of
people associated with the persons, groups or areas expressed by the proper name. A
number of examples is also given in (11) above.","[186, 187, 188]"

NPs with three or more adnominal modifiers can be elicited, as illustrated in (102):(102) upi akan        kupil          do
      fruit black     round          PRX
      ‘the round black fruit’

       ‘a long wide deep dirty river’As illustrated in (103), it is not desirable to accumulate adjectives and stative verbs
within a single NP. The construction given in (a) contains one adjective and two stative
verbs that are not interpreted as adnominal modifiers but as VP heads. In (b), these
stative verbs are embedded in the NP with the linker ba (LNK) that is discussed in the
following section.(103) a. [kaai kul]NP kalieta takata

       4.5     Modifiers linked with ba
In this section, I discuss complex structures with the linker ba (LNK). In these
structures, the linker ba (LNK) links the NP with a modifier constituent. Linked
modifiers come in a variety ranging from NPs, adnominal modifiers such as stative
verbs, quantifiers, demonstratives, to relative clauses and adverbs. In case of relative
clauses, the relativized NP is usually not expressed inside the relative clause (it is
gapped), unless it is a U argument that has to be obligatorily expressed with a
pronominal prefix. In (104), the linked modifier of the bare NP kaai ‘dog’ is the NP
bikeng faring ‘many fleas’.(104) [kaai]NP ba         {he-bikeng faring}NP oro do-kafi-a
      dog        LNK 3II.AL-louse many                 DST 3I.PAT-scratch-DUR
      ‘the dog that has a lot of fleas is scratching over there’                   [B05:060]In (105), the head noun moku ‘kid’ is modified by the stative verb fila ‘be young’. The
NP moku fila ‘little child’ is linked with ba (LNK) to the modifier NP pikai kira
‘stubborn person’, literally ‘hard-headed’:(105) [moku fila]NP             ba    {pikai kira nu}NP
      kid        be.young LNK head be.hard SPC.AD
      ‘a little child that is stubborn’In (106) the bare NP feela ‘friend’ is modified with the NP h-iek bula ‘sharp butt’ that
refers to the fable character Sharp Butt. The modified NP is referred to with the
alienable possessive prefix he- (3II.AL). In the fable, Sharp Butt and Sharp Head venture
to steal coconuts but lacking savvy and solidarity, both die at the end.(106) wah,      [he-feela]NP ba       {h-iek                bula   do}NP   di ò

       ‘wow, his friend Sharp Butt, he is below laughing’                   [B06.077.00:58]In (107), the linked modifier is the deictic oro (DST) that is followed by the anaphoric
demonstrative nu (SPC.AD). The NP headed by fala ‘house’ contains also the numeral
nuku ‘one’. The complex structure expresses the U argument of the verb tukai
‘support’.

he-ayoku ‘second’.(108) nu-kuta,             [e-ratala]NP                ba     {he-ayoku}NUM             bai

       ‘grandfather, your second grandson will actually sit a bit’                  [B02.043.14:32]As illustrated in (109), the linker ba (LNK) may link bare NPs with a single modifier,
usually a stative verb in (a, b). The structures in (a, b) have a restrictive reading.
Consider also the distinction between (b) and (c). While (b) refers to a person that is
bad because of his deeds, (c) has an open reading and refers to a ‘bad guy’, i.e. a person
who does not necessarily do anything bad, but has a potential to do so.(109) a. kaai ba         kika          b. ama          ba     beka          c.    ama         beka

         ‘dog that is brown’                  ‘person that is bad’                ‘bad guy’In (110), the noun ya ‘water’ is modified by the stative verb palata ‘be cold’. The linker
ba (LNK) is obligatory when the following verb dakun-i ‘become dirty’ is to be
interpreted as a modifier (a). The intersective linker ba (LNK) follows the modifier
palata ‘be cold’ and introduces a relative clause. In (b) and (c), the intersective linker ba
(LNK) is not present; consequently, both constructions have a different reading. In (c),
the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) follows the verb dakun-i ‘become dirty’. The
demonstrative is not interpreted as an adnominal modifier because the verb dakun-i
‘become dirty’ is not embedded but predicates over the NP ya palata ‘cold water’. For
the clause level functions of anaphoric demonstratives see section 6.4.3.(110) a. [ya       palata]NP ba       {dakun-i do}RC             b. [ya          palata]NP dakun-i

         ‘the cold water that became dirty’                          ‘cold water became dirty’

            water     be.cold     dirty-put     PRX
            ‘cold water just became dirty’In (111), a full relative clause modifies the list compound NP fu meting ‘betel nut and
betel vine’. The relative clause consists of the A argument ama ‘person’ and the two

verbs mi ‘take’ and sei ‘come down’ conjoined in a serial verb construction. The NP fu
meting ‘betel nut and betel vine’ is logically the U argument of the verb mi ‘take’ but in
the relative clause it is gapped.(111) [fu          meting]NP ba          {ama mi sei                      nu}RC na mi yaa

structure, the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the bare NP kafiei ‘goat’ with the relative
clause nai-d-i nu ‘became lost (some time ago)’. Note that the head noun kafiei ‘goat’ is
the single argument of the verb nai-d- ‘get lost’.(112) moku loku la                sawai [kafiei]NP ba             {nai-d-i       nu}RC     tahai

noun fe ‘pig’ is co-indexed as the possessor of the noun toku ‘leg’ in the relative clause.
The noun toku ‘leg’ serves as the U argument of the verb kor ‘bind’. The A argument

indexed with the possessive prefix he- (3II.AL) and PAT prefix ha- (3II.PAT) inside the

headed by fala ‘house’ contains a possessor e-maama mantan kades ‘your father,
former village head’. This NP is linked with a large relative clause given between curly

brackets. The example comes from a conversation concerning the place name Fota
Ailol. The name refers to a place with a large wide stone that used to be a resting place
in the old days. The speaker described the stone as being located with respect to the
house of the addressee’s uncle. He refers to the house as standing below a big and wide
stone like this.(115) he-n               wò     sei                  [(e-maama        mantan         kades)POSS

a modifier in a structure that functions as single NP. In fact, this definition can be
expanded also to the clause level, as the linker ba (LNK) serves to link verbs in a single
clause (see also section 3.5.6). The linked ba (LNK) has an intersective function; it links
two constituents to a single unit on the level of one of them.
        In the complex NPs given so far, the NP precedes the linker ba (LNK) linking it
with a modifier constituent (adnominal modifier or a clause). The modified NP may be
considered as the head of the construction. However, in some cases, the modifying
constituent precedes the noun or the noun may be omitted. The modifier constituent
has either deictic or possessive function and its location corresponds to the location of
deictics and possessors within the NP. In (116), the relative clause nopa mia ‘be
touching on me’ precedes the NP bataa do ‘the wood’. The linker ba (LNK) follows the
clause. In (b), the expected constituent order is given which is also attested.(116) a. {no-pa                 mi-a}RC ba           [bataa do]NP         ha-fik-i

           ‘the log that is on me’In (117), the relative clause has a deictic function. It precedes the NP ama kang do ‘the
people’. The relative clause is external and it precedes its head ama ‘person’ because its
function is deictic; its structure is parallel to that of an NP. As discussed above, deictic
modifiers precede the head noun in the NP.(117) {melang afeng mi-a}RC ba                [ama         kang      do]NP

In (118), the relative clause is followed by the quantifier loku (PL). The head of the NP
ama ‘person’ is not expressed but its expected position is marked with ∅ following the
relative clause. Because the head is not expressed intersective linker ba (LNK) follows
the quantifier loku (PL). The complex NP serves as argument for the index verb n-u ‘be
like.PRX’. It seems that the relative clause precedes the head because it is deictic.","[191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196]"

19   The quantifier faring ‘many, much’ is possibly related to the quantifier verb fal ‘be together’.

words are part of an embedded NP that modifies the noun kaai ‘dog’.(156) kaai     ba     [he-bikeng faring] oro                do-kafi-a

part of an NP or belongs to the verb. An example is given in (157), where faring

to the quantity of water that is consumed, or to the manner of consumption.(161) neng moku di ya                   kabei          buuk

combined with the generic root d ‘hold’. The complex verb stem is inflected for aspect
and functions as the predicate in the first clause. It is linked with the intersective linker

3.5.4         Aspectual markers
In Abui, aspectual markers are a closed set of elements that mark the aspectual
properties of the referred event on the verb. Aspectual markers lack prosodic
autonomy, they form a prosodic word with the verb. Aspectual markers -a (DUR), -i
(PFV), -e (IPFV), -o (PNCT), and -u (PRF) are analysed as suffixes, because they are
restricted to postverbal position and in some cases are an obligatory morpheme of a
word. 20 The aspectual markers te (INCP.C), se (INCP.I), ti (PHSL.C), and si (PHSL.I) are
never an obligatory morpheme. They are analysed as clitics. An overview of Abui
aspectual suffixes is given in Table 16.","[144, 145, 146]"
"MORPHOLOGY. Abui can be characterized as an agglutinating polysynthetic language.
Nouns tend to be morphologically simple; the possessive inflection is the only nominal
inflection. Verbs tend to be morphologically complex; they are inflected for person and
aspect. In (2), I give an overview of morphological structures found in Abui. Words
consist minimally of a free root (i). Free roots may combine with optional morphemes,
prefixes (ii), suffixes (iii), bound roots (iv), or both prefix and suffix (v). Free roots may
form a complex stem with a bound root and still combine with affixes (vi). A number
of roots are bound; they obligatorily combine with prefixes (vii), suffixes (viii), or both
of them (ix), other bound roots (x), bound roots and suffixes (xi), or all of them (xii) to
form a word.

Abui distinguishes open and closed grammatical categories.
Open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed grammatical categories
are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers, adverbs, and question
words. There is a closed set of generic verbs which are monosegmental roots and have
a number of grammatical functions in argument realization and verb derivation.","[35, 36]"

  7.3.2.3     Semantic contribution of the initial root
In this section, I analyse the function of the initial GV in a complex verb as describing
something that will be referred to as the ‘locus’ of the event, or the spatial constellation
of the event. As suggested in section 7.3.2 and illustrated in (76), the initial generic root
of a homogeneous CV is related to the locus of the event. A large paradigm is given in
(114). Because of their final verb k, all these verbs refer to events that are classified as
motions, while the medial verb a ‘be at’ indicates that the event has no internal
boundary. The initial verb is variable, and indicates the spatial constellation of the
event.(114) t-a-k           ‘bring down, shoot, empty’                  s-a-k             ‘move along, pass along’

         give-be.at-bring                                         bring-be.at-bring
15 Here, a large body of literature on Aktionsart and the established classifications as states, activities,
accomplishments, and achievements (Vendler 1967) is reffered to. More specifically, the distinctions between stative
[−ADD TO] and dynamic [+ADD TO] made by (Verkuyl 1972) are particularly interesting, and later quantized
and cumulative feature (Krifka 1998).

        As ‘locus’ marking derivational morphemes, initial generic verbs take a
perspective that is quite different from what we are used to in derivational morphology.
For example, the verb t ‘lie’ indicates a horizontal ‘locus’ that is reached by the motion
(expressed by k ‘bring’). The verb s ‘lie’ indicates a parallel ‘locus’. The verb p ‘touch’
indicates a locus that may be described as ‘touching of a surface’, while the root d ‘hold’
encodes that the event involves an ‘overall’ type of contact between participants and
their location. The root b ‘join’ indicates an intersecting locus, while the root f ‘sever’
refers to a separated locus. The root l ‘give’ refers to a locus that may be described as
‘in reach’. Practically it means that the involved participants are ‘in reach’ of each other,
but more distant from each other than e.g. when the generic verb is p ‘touch’ or b ‘join’.
At the same time the participants are still within reach of each other, unlike the
participants in cases when the roots u ‘leave’ (pronounced and written as w in initial
position) and f ‘sever’ are used. The verb u ‘leave’ indicates the remote locus. The verb
ì/y ‘put’ was illustrated in (87); it indicates an overlay locus. A summary is given in Table
27. (An asterisk indicates that the root does not occur at all, brackets indicate other
specialized functions.)                Table 27: Event ‘locus’ encoded by the generic verbs in initial position                  ROOT      GLOSS       ‘LOCUS’ ENCODED BY THE INITIAL ROOT

        Each of the CVs given in (114) is exemplified in (115)-(126). The CV t-a-k was
discussed previously in (80)-(83), (98), and (99). The CV s-a-k is given in (115). It refers

single argument expressed by the complex NP in the first line:(117) oto       he-ama             kang         ba      [ho-mi          mi-a             loku yo]RC

indicates the locus of the event as an ‘overall contact’. The CV combines with the
pronominal prefix na- (1SG.PAT) co-indexing the speaker as patient. It is inflected for
imperfective aspect with suffix -e (IPFV):(118) me      na-d-a-k-e!

of the CV is the NP tuli tala ‘leaves of tree sp.’ that is co-indexed with the prefix ha-
(3II.PAT) as patient. The speaker is expressed as benefactive with the prefix ne- (1SG.LOC)
on the verb l ‘give’.(119) tuli      tala      mi ba            ne-l          ha-d-a-k-e

17In Abui traditional medicine, the diseases with symptoms such as fever or rush are healed by clutching the
leaves of the ‘tuli’ tree to the affected parts of the body.

The stem d-a-k is also used to refer to fish and mouse traps. The bamboo traps referred
to with the stem dak clutch an animal after the trigger part is touched. In (120), the CV
b-a-k is illustrated. It refers to motion away from the DC with locus described as
‘intersection’ corresponding to the English verb ‘snatch’. It combines with the free
pronoun na (1SG).(120) na he-l             b-a- k-i                 ba     làk-i

CV f-a-k is given. It describes a motion oriented away from the DC. This motion has
the separation locus. In (121), the CV f-a-k ‘break’ occurs in intransitive construction.(121) abui       mi-a          ne-toku        fak-i

away from the DC. The locus of this event is described by the root ‘give’ as being ‘in

serial construction with iéng ‘see’ it gives the meaning of ‘know’.(123) na he-d-o                   n-iéng         l-a-k     naha

In (125), the CV w-a-k refers to a motion oriented away from the DC. The locus of the
event is encoded with the root w ‘leave’. It indicates the ‘remoteness’ of the
participants. The CV w-a-k is related to the CV w-o-k ‘throw’. The U argument of the
CV w-a-k is the NP ni-ya maama o ‘mother and father’. The verb refers to
‘abandoning’ of parents by their children.(125) ni-ya              maama o          wat                    he

prefix ta- (DISTR.PAT). It refers to ‘embracing’ of two participants. This is encoded as a
motion away from the DC. The root w ‘leave’ indicates the remote locus. Because both
participants are affected they are co-indexed as patients on the CV.(126) di ning      ayoku ta-w-a-k                         ba             luuk do=ng          we

descriptions of events from a perspective that is radically different from that of more
familiar languages. The paradigms suggest that the question of lexicalization cannot be
answered without intensive further research.
        Some more paradigms of the CVs with alternating first root are given below. In
(127), the root m ‘be in’ encodes the event locus as being in the same location.(127) p-a-ng              ‘feel, shape, form’          m-a-ng-               ‘possess’

       lie-be.at-see                                   join-be.at-seeIn (128), all verbs contain the final root l ‘give’ that indicates that the event is externally
caused. The root u ‘leave’ refers to the event that reached its final boundary and has
persistent effect. The initial roots encode the locus. As discussed in the initial part of
this section, the root f ‘sever’ refers to the separation locus of two participants. The
root k ‘bring’ refers to locus that is not in reach but not too remote. The root r ‘reach’
refers to the locus where participants were previously in ‘in reach or fixed’ of each
other. Finally, the root t ‘lie’ refers to horizontal locus of the participants.(128) f-u-l            ‘swallow’                       k-u-l                 ‘throw’

The use of the CV r-u-l is illustrated in (129) and (130). In (129), the CV combines
with two arguments. The A argument is expressed with the free pronoun di (3A). The U
argument is the NP de-namang ‘her own clothes’ and co-indexed with the prefix ha-
(3II.PAT) as patient on the CV. It corresponds to the English verb ‘take off’ because it
combines with the argument ‘clothes’.(129) di fa            de-namang ha-r-u-l                 ba             ko     da-wel

r-u-l is the NP de-kafiei ‘his goat’. The CV r-u-l corresponds in this case to the English
verb ‘untie’.","[359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364]"

        ‘axes, swords and red whetstones’In coordinating constructions, at least two nouns are conjoined by a conjunction
marker or simply listed with an intonational pause after each of the constituents.
Coordinating constructions must be distinguished from list compounds (see section
126                                       CHAPTER III
4.3.3). The order of constituents in a list compound is lexicalized, while in case of
coordinating construction this is not the case.
        The conjunction markers ba (LNK), ya (SEQ), and re ‘or’ may be used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain. The linker ba (LNK) joins two constituents so that they
have shared reference to a single referent or event. I refer to this linker as ‘intersective’.
The intersective linker ba (LNK) may be used in nominal domain to link an NP to other
constituents (relative clauses, numerals, deictics, other NPs) that serve as adnominal
modifiers. In (169), the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the head noun kaai ‘dog’ with
the modifier NP he-bikeng faring ‘his many lice’. The complex NP serves as the A
argument of the verb kafia ‘scrape, scratch’ and it is co-indexed with the prefix do-
(3I.REC).(169) [kaai]NP ba       {he-bikeng faring}NP oro do-kafi-a
      dog        LNK 3II.AL-louse many                 DST 3I.REC-scrape-DUR
      ‘that dog with many lice is scratching (itself) over there’                    [B05.060.02]In section 4.5, I discuss other structures that are linked with the intersective linker ba
(LNK) to an NP. In the verbal domain, ba (LNK) links two verbs as in (170) the verbs
bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’. The events of ‘carrying’ and ‘going’ refer to a complex event
‘carry towards’.(170) tafaa di bang ba              yaa     melang       mi-a-d-i
      drum 3A carry LNK go                  village      be.in-be.at-hold-PFV
      ‘he carried drums to the village’                                           [B02.118.07:50]       The linked verbs form a tight unit that falls under the scope of a negation. This
type of construction is different from serial verb constructions, which are defined as a
verb clusters without any conjunction markers (see 8.1). The use of ba (LNK) in the
verbal domain will not be further analysed in the current description.
       The intersective linker ba (LNK) contrasts with the non-intersective linker ya
glossed as SEQ(uential). ya (SEQ) indicates a non-intersective union of two constituents
(a sequence of phrases or clauses). It may be used in both nominal and verbal domain.
In the nominal domain, ya (SEQ) links two NPs. This is illustrated in (171), where two
NPs are linked. Recall (169), to see the contrast with ba (LNK) that can not serve as a
coordinating conjunction marker.(171) a. Fan Malei ya        Fan Ata                  b. luka-luka     ya       yoikoi

In the verbal domain, ya (SEQ) links verbs that retain their own reference so that the
construction is read as a sequence of events. Example (170) is contrasted with example
(172) below. In (172), the verbs bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’ do not refer to a single event
because the ‘carrying’ preceded the ‘going’.(172) tafaa di bang ya            yaa melang mi-a-d-i

      ‘he carried drums and (then) went to the village’In (173), a more complex example is given, where the non-intersective linker ya (SEQ)
marks that the verbs we ‘leave’, tahai ‘search’ and marang ‘go up’ describe successive
events.(173) a     we ya afu do             kabei tahai ya         marang                  na       nee re

questions, in which two or more possible answers are presented. It is used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain as illustrated in (174).(174) a. maama       re ni-ya                              b. a          la         taa re a            me?

given in (175).(175) a. he-ni-l                       ba               b.            he-ni-l                                 mi

have been around for a longer time than the loans that are not adapted. The original
consonant clusters in the older loans were syllabified. As illustrated in (57), some loans
have been borrowed again at a later stage with a different meaning. The loan baleka ‘10
liter volume unit’ (from Dutch blik and Malay blek) was according to the language
consultants used already before the WWII and referred to a volume unit of rice or corn.
This volume unit was used to quantify the tax in natura to be paid to the
administration. As volume unit the word baleka is still used today. The loan word blek
‘can, bucket’ was borrowed more recently, and refers to any type of metal can or

        2.4     Prosodic word
In Abui, syllables building up prosodic words are either heavy (h) or light (l). A light
syllable is characterized by a monomoraic nucleus; the nucleus of a heavy syllable is
bimoraic. A bimoraic nucleus contains either a long vowel or a vowel sequence that
both attract the stress (see 2.5). In this section, I discuss the prosodic words in three
subgroups according to their composition and function. These factors seem to be
reflected by the phonological shape of each group. As first, in section 2.4.1, I discuss
Abui nouns. Abui nouns tend to be morphologically simple and consist of maximally
three syllables allowing heavy syllables typically in word-final position and in a few cases
in the penultimate position. In section 2.4.2, I give an overview of loans that are
adapted to Abui prosodic word structure. The verbs and function words are discussed
in section 2.4.3. They tend to be morphologically complex and consist of up to five
syllables.","[65, 66]"

4.1.2    Common nouns
In Abui, common nouns refer to either a single object such as war ‘sun’ or have a more
generic reference, e.g. wi ‘rock’ describing a solid material occurring in different shapes
that may be used for building terraces around villages. In (13), a number of common
nouns are listed.

       4.2      Possessive inflection of nouns
In Abui, the nominal category displays only possessive inflection; similar to other
Papuan languages, inflections for case or number are not found (cf. Foley, 1986:93-6).
The prototypical construction of possession expresses the relationship of ownership
between a human possessor and an inanimate possessum. This construction has a
number of extensions to refer to other semantic relationships such as kinship or part-
whole relation. The Abui possessive construction consists of a noun expressing the
possessum and a pronominal prefix expressing the possessor. Optionally, in third
person the possessor is expressed with an additional NP. This is illustrated in (15). In
(a), the prefix ne- (1SG.AL) expresses that the possessor of fala ‘house’ is the speaker. In
(b), the prefix he- (3II.AL) expresses the possessor of sepeda ‘bike’. The pronoun refers
to the NP maama ‘father’.(15)   a. ne-fala                                 b.   maama       he-sepeda

140                                          CHAPTER IV
The nouns that express the possessum are divided into two subgroups according to
their morphological properties. There is a closed set of INHERENTLY POSSESSED NOUNS
and a set of OPTIONALLY POSSESSED NOUNS. 3 The set of inherently possessed nouns
contains bound nominal roots that refer to most body parts, a number of kinship terms
and a single relational noun.","[161, 162, 163]"

          4 Nouns and Noun Phrases
In this chapter, I discuss Abui nouns and noun phrases. Abui nouns are defined by
their referential properties as lexical items referring to time-stable concrete entities
(unique persons, places, or objects, discussed in 4.1). There are also lexical items that
refer to less concrete (typically) uncountable objects and substances. These lexical items
are ambiguous as they may as well refer to events, and they are analysed as categorially
indetermined (see section 3.2.2). Their grammatical category is determined by their
syntactic context. When an ambiguous item is inserted in the head position of an NP
structure; it is identified as a noun.
        In Abui, there is a systematic difference between animate and inanimate
referents. Animate referents are typically expressed by unambiguously nominal lexical
items. Nouns referring to animates are treated differently in grammatical operations
such as possessive inflection or person inflection on the verbs (see 3.2.4). Inanimate
nouns have a more generic reference and denote substances rather than individuated
objects; they are underspecified for number, shape or size. In discourse, inanimate
nouns often combine with other elements that specify their number, shape, or size.
        Abui nouns combine with pronominal prefixes that express possessors (see
section 4.2). Nouns can be derived by compounding and nominalization of verbal
roots, as discussed in section 4.3. Nouns serve as the head constituent of a noun
phrase, presented in section 4.4. In addition to possessors, the head noun combines
with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives, modifier nouns,
stative verbs, adjectives, quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives. The order of these
constituents is fixed (see 4.4.5). Optionally, an NP may contain an embedded modifier,
typically a relative clause (see section 4.5). Besides expressing arguments, NPs may
serve as the main predicate of a sentence, as a nominal predicate. This chapter ends
with an overview of nominal predicates in section 4.6.","[154, 155, 156]"
"       5.1    Semantic macroroles: actor and undergoer
Event participants are realized as arguments of the verb that encodes the referred
event. The arguments are expressed with NPs and/or pronouns (free and bound
pronouns). Event participants may be identified for two generalized semantic
macroroles actor and undergoer (cf. Van Valin and LaPolla 1997:139-141).
Participants that are characterized as volitionally and actively involved in the event or
state are identified as actors (cf. Dowty 1991). In Abui, actors are realized as the A
argument of a verb with an NP and/or a free pronoun. Participants that are
characterized as not actively involved and undergoing the event or state are identified as
undergoers. In Abui, undergoers are realized as the U argument of the verb with an
NP and/or a bound pronoun. This is schematically represented in Figure 18. An event
is characterized by a number of semantic properties (state, dynamic, etc.). Each
participant carries a number of inherent semantic properties (animacy, individuation).

             [+VOLITION]              Figure 18: Semantic features identifying participants for A and U macroroleInherent semantic properties of the participants (animacy) may be sufficient to
determine the direction, in which an event was performed; i.e. who is acting upon
whom. In most cases, participants identified as actor are animate. They are moving,
consuming, cutting etc; they are characterized by features [+CONTROL] and [+VOLITION]
(in that order). On the other hand, participants identified as undergoer tend to be
inanimate. They are consumed, moved, cut; and so on; so in general, they are
characterized as [+AFFECTED].
        As mentioned in section 3.2.3, Abui nouns do not display any case inflection.
When arguments are expressed as lexical NPs, the semantic roles of the arguments are
determined by the animacy of their referents. This is illustrated in (1), where a transitive
and an intransitive construction are given. In both constructions, the verb occurs in the
final position; the arguments precede the verb. In (a), the verb nee ‘eat’ combines with
the NPs ama ‘person’ and sieng ‘rice’. The NP ama ‘human’ has an animate referent
and is identified as the A argument. The NP sieng ‘rice’ is identified as the U argument
because it is inanimate. In (b), the NP fala ‘house’ is the single argument of the verb fak
‘break’. It is identified as the U argument because it is affected by course of the event.(1)    a. ama         sieng     nee                        b. fala          fak-i

           ‘someone eats rice/people eat rice’                   ‘a house broke down’In transitive constructions, the order of arguments expressed as lexical NPs is
determined pragmatically. This is illustrated in (2)-(3), where the syntactic order of the
NPs does not indicate whether they should be identified as A or U arguments. The NP
ama ‘person, people’ has an animate referent. It is identified as the A argument. The
NPs kawen ‘machete’ and bataa ‘wood’ are identified as U arguments because their
referent is inanimate. This shows that the semantic role of an argument is identified by
the animacy of the referent. In pragmatically neutral order, the A argument precedes
the U argument. When the order of arguments is reversed, the semantic roles assigned
to the arguments do not change. Instead, the construction with the reversed NP
ordering is pragmatically marked; the fronted NP expressing the U argument is in
focus.

       5.2      Arguments expressed as NPs vs. pronouns
As mentioned above, the arguments may be expressed as lexical NPs and/or pronouns.
In examples (1)-(3), the arguments were expressed with bare NPs. Consider now
example (4), where the arguments of the verb fakda ‘split, break up’ are expressed with
the lexical NPs maama ‘father’ and bataa ‘wood’. The semantic role of the arguments is
identified by the animacy of the referent. In (b), in addition to both NPs, the verb fakda
combines with a bound pronoun he- that co-indexes the U argument bataa ‘wood’.(4)    a. maama          bataa       fak-d-a
             father        wood      break-hold-DUR
             ‘father splits wood’
       b. maama          bataa       he-fak-d-a
             father        wood     3II.LOC-break-hold-DUR
             ‘father splits the wood, (the nearer defined quantity of wood)’               [B05.014.01]In (4), the second construction has a specific reading. The NP bataa, which is co-
indexed by the bound pronoun he- refers to a specific quantity of wood, known to the
speaker. In (a), the NP bataa ‘wood’ refers to any particular quantity of wood, but to
wood in general of unspecified quantity; the construction has a generic reading. In sum,
participants that are [+specific] are co-indexed with a pronoun.
        Another example is given in (5), where the verb kafi ‘scrape’ is used in transitive
construction. In (a), the verb kafi ‘scrape’ combines with the U argument arui ‘ashes’.
In (b), the U argument is expressed with the complex NP e-toku ba yokung nu ‘your
septic leg’. It is co-indexed with the pronominal prefix on the verb kafi ‘scrape, scratch’
because the NP has a [+specific] reference, as it is overtly marked by the anaphoric
demonstrative nu (SPC.AD).(5)    a. kaai diking               pe=ng      marei         ba      arui         kafi-a

pronoun. The alternation is triggered by the feature [±specific]. As for the A argument,
the same alternation is found. In (6), the A argument of the verb sei ‘come down’ is
expressed with the NP moku loku ‘children’. The verb sei ‘come down’ combines with
the U argument sakola ‘school’ that is co-indexed with the bound pronoun. In (a), the
NP moku loku ‘children’ has a generic reading; it does not refer to any children in
particular. In (b), the NP moku loku ‘children’ has a specific reading because it is co-
indexed with the free pronoun di (3A). In this case, the speaker refers to a certain group
of children that he has in mind.(6)    a. moku      loku         sakola       he-sei

           ‘the children come down for some school (education)’                  [B03.003.02]In (7), the NP kaai ‘dog’ is the A argument of the verb fur ‘swallow’. While in (a) the
bare NP has a generic reading, in (b) the bare NP is co-indexed by the free pronoun di
(3A) and has a specific reading (certain dog/dogs).(7)    a. kaai         afu    loku ha-fur-i
           dog         fish PL       3II.PAT-swallow.CPL-PFV

           ‘a certain dog/certain dogs swallowed the fish’                       [B05.024.03]Another example is given in (8), where the NP kaai ‘dog’ is identified as the A
argument of the verb loi ‘put far, chase’. In (a), the NP is bare and has a generic
reading. In (b), the NP kaai do ‘dog (that I just talked about)’ is definite. The head noun
kaai ‘dog’ combines with anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) and is co-indexed with the
free pronoun di (3A) as the A argument of the verb. Note that the verb loi ‘put far,
chase’ combines with two bound pronouns; more details about verbs that combine
with two bound pronouns can be found in section 6.2.1 and 6.1.3.

mosquitoes are referred to; the speaker refers to those mosquitoes that were biting him
last night. This is encoded by free pronoun di (3A) that co-indexes the NP kumal
‘mosquito’ as the A argument of the verbs l ‘give’ and takei ‘bite’.(9)    a. war tama maiye               kumal       tafuda mong-e

because the U argument is human. More details about this type of constructions can be
found in section 8.4.2.4.
        The referential properties of the expressed participant may trigger alternation in
their realization as arguments as represented in Figure 19. In sum, the arguments with
[+specific] reference are expressed with a pronoun and an optional NP, while the
arguments with [−specific] reference are expressed exclusively with NPs. The
distributional properties of pronouns copy the distinction found between the two
semantic macroroles. The free pronouns express A arguments, bound pronouns
express U arguments.                                       macrorole                A                                                         U

       5.3      Arguments expressed as free pronouns
As discussed in section 5.2, participants that are identified as [+specific] are expressed
with pronouns; free pronouns express A arguments, bound pronouns express U
arguments. In this section, I will discuss A arguments expressed with free pronouns.
The paradigm of Abui free pronouns is given in Table 21.","[200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205]"

3.5.1     Adjectives
In Abui, the grammatical category of adjectives contains only six items. They refer to
the properties of participants such as colour, size or age just as stative verbs (see
3.4.4.8). Adjectives are differentiated from the stative verbs because they cannot head a
VP. This is illustrated in (120), where the adjectives akan ‘black’ and abet ‘young’
modify the head noun (a, b), and cannot head a VP (c, d). In order to be used as head
of a VP, the adjectives akan ‘black’ and abet ‘young’ must combine with a generic root
in a complex verb. In (e, f), the adjectives combine with the generic root ì ‘put’.

‘white’ are given. It is possible, that the adjectival category contains a few more
members, which I have not found yet. However, most words that refer to participant
properties such as colour, size or age are stative verbs.(121) a. mayol maek                                    b. moku        dakun

3.5.2    Demonstratives
Demonstratives are forms that indicate the location of a referent or event in space or
discourse. They are mainly monosyllabic forms (except for oro) that terminate in the
vowel /ɔ/. Demonstratives may combine with nouns, verbs on the phrase level, and
with clauses on the sentence level.
        Demonstratives that locate the referent in space are the deictic demonstratives;
they always precede the head noun of an NP. Demonstratives that indicate the location
of the referent in discourse are anaphoric demonstratives; they follow the head noun.
In combination with verbs, the function of Abui demonstratives is analogous to the
nominal domain. When the demonstrative precedes the head verb of a VP, it refers to
the location of the event. When it follows the head verb, it locates the event expressed
by the VP in discourse.
        In this section, I first give an overview of Abui deictic demonstratives (see
3.5.2.1), and then discuss the anaphoric demonstratives (see 3.5.2.2). Details about the
usage of the demonstratives in the nominal domain can be found in section 4.4.3;
details about the functions of demonstratives in verbal domain in sections 6.3.2 and
6.4.3.
                                 GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                       111
   3.5.2.1    Abui deictic demonstratives
Abui deictic precede the head constituent and indicate the spatial location of the head
constituent. As in other domains of Abui grammar, the demonstratives are organized
along the relative frame of reference based in either speaker or addressee. The
horizontal distance from the deictic centre is categorized by the axis
PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL. The vertical location is specified only for medial and distal
referents. As illustrated in (122), the noun sura ‘book’ combines with proximal deictic
demonstratives do (PRX) and to (PRX.AD). Following Levinson (2003), these deictic
demonstratives refer to the proximate location of a figure (F) with respect of the
viewpoint (V). In (a), the viewpoint is located at the speaker, while in (b); it is located at
the addressee. Often the addressee based demonstrative is used to draw addressee
attention. Mostly, the speaker based demonstrative is used.(122) a. do           sura                         b. to            sura
         PRX          book                            PRX.AD       book
         ‘this book (near me)’                        ‘this book (near you)’In other words, these deictic demonstratives have a relative frame of reference (cf.
Levinson 2003:43-47). They refer to a location with alternating viewpoint (V) over
speaker or addressee (cf. Levinson 2003:24-61).
        The second axis of Abui deictic systems is a horizontal axis that measures the
distance of F from the ground (G). As illustrated in (123), a nearby horizontal distance
of F is expressed with the deictic demonstratives do (PRX) and to (PRX.AD). I refer to
these deictic demonstratives as ‘proximal’. A distant position of F with respect to G is
indicated with the deictic demonstratives o (MD) and yo (MD.AD) that alternate V over
the speaker and the addressee. In (e), the far distance of F, further than the previous
one, is expressed with the deictic oro (DST). In the distal position the alternation of V
does not apply.(123) a. do           fala                         b. o      fala
         PRX          house                           MD house
         ‘this house (near me)’                       ‘that house there (further from me)’
       c. to             fala                      d. yo            fala
           PRX.AD       house                         MD.AD house
           ‘this house (near you)’                    ‘that house there (further from you)’
       e. oro     fala
           DST house
           ‘that house over there (far from us)’The last axis constituting the Abui deictic system is the vertical axis. This axis does not
apply to proximate positions and is absolute (V cannot be alternated). The deictic
demonstratives in (124) refer to vertically oriented positions of F. Medial (less
proximate) positions are expressed with the low medial deictic ò (MD.L) and high medial
deictic ó (MD.H); distal positions are referred to with the low distal deictic wò (DST.L)
and high distal deictic wó (DST.H). The suprasegmental features of a deictic form
112                                          CHAPTER III
indicate either high or low position: the high tone indicates the high position, while the
low tone the low position.(124) a. ò          moku                                            b. ó              moku

             ‘that child below over there’                                 ‘that child above over there’In Table 14, an overview of Abui deictic demonstratives is given.","[132, 133, 134, 135]"
"  8.4.2.7    SVC with ì ‘put’
The generic verb ì ‘put’ is used as a minor verb in SVCs encoding the following
grammatical functions: (i) It encodes the possessor of an object in possessive SVCs. (ii)
In modal SVC it expresses the participant that is imposed to perform some activity. In
400                                     CHAPTER VIII
both cases the participant is realized as the U argument of the minor verb ì ‘put’ with
the LOC prefix. This suggests that the modal SVC of obligation is a functional extension
of the possessive SVC.
         POSSESSIVE SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The possessor of an object may be expressed
as the U argument of the verb ì ‘put’ with the LOC prefix, that typically expresses
locations. The third person argument may be optionally expressed also as a NP. The
LOC prefix is polysemous: it expresses also the alienable possessor in the nominal
domain (see 4.2.1). The possessors are in fact encoded as ‘locations’ not only in the
possessive SVC but also in the regular possessive construction. In (155) the minor verb
ì ‘put’ is serialized with nari ‘do like this’. The possessor is expressed in the same way as
the benefactive with the LOC prefix. Both verbs share the A argument Waksi:(155) Waksi wan        ne-pen           mi     ne-ì           na-r-i
      name already 1SG.AL-pen           take   1SG.LOC-put be.like.PRX.CNT-reach-PFV
      ‘Waksi gave me back my pen’                                             [B05.048.01]Some usages of the possessive SVC are quite puzzling, such as the one given in (156).
The minor verb ì ‘put’ is serialized with the major verb pun ‘grab’. The possessed ‘bow
and arrow’ expressed in the first clause are omitted:(156) di de-pet    de-pulang          pun-a            ba     làk-e,       na ne-ì
      3A 3I.AL-bow 3I.AL-arrow        grab.CPL-DUR     LNK    leave.for-IPFV 1SG 1SG.LOC-put
       pun-a           naha
       grab.CPL-DUR NEG
       ‘he took his bow and arrows and left, I did not take mine’               [B07.053.04]The form neì reminds of a free possessive pronoun such as English ‘my’ or ‘mine’. In
Abui there are no free possessive pronouns but possessive SVCs could possibly
become their source.
        MODAL SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The minor verb ì ‘put’ encodes the participant
imposed to perform an event. This SVC will be referred to as ‘modal’ encoding deontic
modality. However, there are a number of other modal SVCs discussed in other parts
of this section (see sections 8.3.4 and 8.4.6). An example is given in (89) where the
minor verb ì ‘put’ combines with we ‘leave’. Interestingly, the single participant is
encoded in the same way as the benefactive/malefactive with the LOC prefix:(157) ne-ì           we
      1SG.LOC-put leave
      ‘I have to leave’                                                         [B05.045.04]Observe that the obligation imposed on the participant might be internal as no A
argument is expressed. In some instances the previous context identifies the imposing
force. Consider now (158) where the minor verb ì ‘put’ combines with the verb mon
‘die’. The force that imposes the participant to die is expressed in the previous two
clauses:

construction using the LOC prefix that has the same reference as the A argument. The
transitive construction has in such cases a ‘reflexive’ reading. An example is given in
(159) where the ‘rain’ is encoded as internally bound to ‘come down’:(159) ahana          beka     do, anui de-ì             sei
      whirlwind be.bad PRX rain 3I.LOC-put              come.down.CNT
      ‘during the rainy season the rain must come down’                      [B07.044.04]
8.4.3    SVCs with minor verbs quantifying participants
The second subtype of asymmetrical SVCs II is characterized by minor verb belonging
to the quantifying-verb class such as ning ‘be (number)’, fal ‘separate (from others, in
fact together)’, and tafuda ‘be all’. The minor verb specifies the quantity of the
participants. It combines either with an A or an U argument. The verb ning ‘be
(number)’ is followed by the appropriate number and quantifies the A argument as
discussed in 8.4.3.1. The verb fal ‘separate’ described in 8.4.3.2 quantifies either A or U
argument. The verb tafuda ‘be all’ (8.4.3.3) usually quantifies the U argument.","[422, 423, 424]"

(23), are found as heads of both NPs and VPs. They are identified as inalienably
possessed nouns, or as verbs. In (a), the forms bang ‘shoulder’ and bang ‘carry on
shoulder’ are phonologically identical. So are the forms -mol ‘enemy’ and -mol ‘envy’.
The forms in (c, d) carry a different tone. The noun -ièng ‘eye’ is marked with the low
tone, while the verb -iéng ‘see’ carries the high tone. The tone distinctions are not
systematic; the noun táng ‘hand’ in (d) carries the high tone, while the verb tàng
‘release’ carries the low tone. Other words such as baki (e) or toku (f) are possibly of
verbal origin. For more information about tone, see section 2.5.4.(23)   a. bang                                     b. -mol

The ambiguity of the form -mol is exemplified in (24). In (a), the form mol is used as
the head of a VP and combines with two arguments. The presence of the free pronoun
di (3A) indicates the structure as a clause. At the same time, the free pronoun excludes
the possibility of interpreting the structure as a possessive construction. In (b), the form
na-mol is used referring to a person that hates the speaker.(24)    a. Orpa      di Lon Fan he-mol                     b. na-mol

terms ai ‘wife’ and kuta ‘grandparent’. They are the only kinship terms that combine
with prefixes of set I. The other kinship terms are optionally/alienably possessed; I
discuss them in section 4.2.3. Consider now example (25) and observe the unusual
inflection of the stems hai, ai, nai, tai referring to ‘wife’. The onset of the stem
referring to ‘wife’ is always the same as the onset of the possessive prefix.(25)    a. he-hai                     ‘his/her wife’                    *ha-hai        *hai

           2SG.AL-grandparentThe stem referring to ‘wife’ seems to carry double pronominal inflection. The alienable
pronominal prefix is attached to a stem. There is another pronominal prefix attached to
the nominal root ai. The root ai itself is polysemous; it covers a range of meanings such
as ‘vein’, ‘root’, and ‘side’. The meaning ‘wife’ maybe diachronically derived from the
verbal stem ai ‘be at side’ as illustrated in (26). The stem ai combines with a pronominal
prefix expressing the U argument. The VP is reanalyzed as a new nominal stem and
takes alienable possessive inflection.(26)    ne-[n-aiVP]NP                      ‘my wife’, lit.: ‘my (be at my side)’

4.2.3     Optionally possessed nouns
Only the nouns discussed in 4.2.2 are inherently/inalienably possessed. All remaining
nouns are optionally/alienably possessed. That means that they may combine with
pronominal prefixes, but that the possessive inflection is not required. These nouns

(ALIEANABLE). This is illustrated in (27), where the nouns may combine only with
alienable possessive prefixes (see left-hand column), but not with inalienable possessive
prefixes (in middle column). These nouns are free forms that do not require possessive
inflection (see right-hand column).(27)   a. he-fala                      b. *ha-fala                       c.        fala

a number of body part nouns that are optionally possessed:(29)   ne-toku          ‘my leg’                     *na-toku            toku                ‘leg’

reference and is used metaphorically in cases such as pikai kira literally ‘hard head’ that
refers to ‘stubborn’ people, as in (30).

require possessive inflection in cases such as toku lohu ‘long leg’ that refers to a ‘tall’
person. The noun ui ‘back’ does not require possessive inflection when it refers to the
back side of inanimate entities such as houses, as illustrated in (40) in section 4.2.4.
       Most kinship terms combine with alienable prefixes. They are optionally
possessed.(31)     e-ya                    ‘your mother’                          *a-ya                 yaya

constructions and in lists. An example is given in (32), which is taken from a traditional
narrative that describes the ancestry of Alila village:(32)     muknehi,       wil,     kalieta,        kokda         fing

4.2.4      Metaphorical extension of possessive relationship
The possessive construction prototypically expresses the relationship of ownership
between a human possessor and an (in)animate possessum. This relationship may be
metaphorically extended to express the relationship between two inanimate entities in a
part-whole relation. This is illustrated in (33), where the nouns ahama ‘remnant’ and
tantama ‘middle’ combine with possessive prefix cross-referencing the ‘possessor’
realized as the NP pet ‘bow’ or kariang ‘work’ respectively. Note that in both cases, the
alienable possessive prefix is used.","[165, 166, 167, 168, 169]"

2 Kalang Fat, the name Abui name for the Alor town Kalabahi possibly refers to pre-colonial trade in thatplace. Alor was a convenient place to replenish the food supplies and water for vessels heading to Timor in
search of sandal wood. The comodities traded by the Abui were possibly corn and gum-lac from Acacias
(referred to as ‘gum-lac trees’). ‘Gum-lac trees’ produce a resinous exudation from punctures, made by
parasitic lac insects.

The areas and peoples outside the Abui territory have in few cases native names. In

Note that some roots are grouped together, and are analyzed as alternating roots. These
roots share the same semantic core and have a similar place of articulation. They can be
phonologically characterized as alveodental liquids (l, r), non-labial nasals (n, ng), and
unvoiced alveodental obstruents (t, s). The alternation reflects the internal temporal
structure of the referred event (inner aspect, Aktionsart). An event referred to with the
single semantic core is viewed either as having an endpoint (completive), or an initial

point (inceptive).8 In (85) the alternation of the generic verbs l ‘give’ and r ‘reach’ is
illustrated.(85)     a. ya        kabei mi         ne-l-e!

function is that of a predicate in a monoverbal clause. This is illustrated in (86), where
the generic root ì ‘put’ is used as the main predicate of the clause bataa do ì ‘the wood
is put (down)’.(86)     di yaar-i             ya      bataa      do          ì       di he-wahai            yo

verbal roots. This is illustrated in (87), where the root ì ‘put’ combines with the prefix
no- (1SG.REC) and with durative suffix -a (DUR). It shares the A argument ama ba nala
kapuk adua ‘tailor’ with the verb mi ‘take’ in the first clause.(87)     ama       ba       nala kapuk adua                namang mi             ba       no-ì-a

the root ì ‘put’ used in a serial verb construction is given in (88). It is serialized with
three verbs. The first one is the verb mi ‘take’ that combines with the U argument sura

U argument meja ‘table’. The third one is the generic root ng ‘see’ that encodes the

8 The glosses of the generic roots l/r and ng/n stresses the distinction [±completive], while the gloss of s/t
stresses the distinction [±inceptive]. The glossing is somewhat misleading because it does not specify the
aspectual properties of the [−completive] and [−inceptive] roots. In fact, the roots t/s can be glossed as s ‘lie
down’ and t ‘lie down.CPL’ to match the alternation [±completive] used for the roots l/r and ng/n. I decided
not to use these glosses because they are too large to gloss a monosegmental root.

In serial verb constructions, the generic roots often serve to realize and mark certain
types of participants such as benefactives, recipients, or instruments. In (89), the root ì
‘put’ is serialized with the motion verb we ‘leave’. Consider the situation where the
speaker is about to leave because it is getting late and he should have left before. In
those cases the construction given below can be used. The speaker refers to the
necessity of his departure. It is encoded as ‘put’ on him that he should leave. In such a
case, the root ì ‘put’ has a modal reading.(89)   ne-ì              we

in detail in chapter 8, in particular in section 8.4.2.
        Evidence of the verbhood of the generic verb a ‘be at’ is provided in (90). The
verb a ‘be at’ combines with the distributive prefix to- (DISTR.REC) and is serialized with
the verb mit-i ‘sit’.(90)   he-ya             he-maama nu                to-a                  mit-i

stative verbs from bound verbal roots (see 7.2.1).
        The generic verb d ‘hold’ can be used as a single predicate as in (91). The verb d
‘hold, get’, or here ‘acquire’, combines with the perfect suffix -u (PRF).(91)   afe     tura-tara,     kawen dara ha-d-u                        naha,      mai       hu ama

‘hold’ are illustrated. It may derive new verbs from existing verbs, such as tilak ‘hang

Serial verb constructions with the generic verb d ‘hold, become’ are discussed in section
8.4.2.2. In (92)-(93), the verb d ‘hold’ occurs in complex verbs that are discussed in
detail in section 7.2. In (93), the verb d ‘hold’ combines with the root kik ‘red’.(93)   na-kik-d-i

It refers to leaning of the ladder to the door of the house. Abui houses are built on
poles and in order to enter a house, one has to use a ladder.(95)   di       awering do            ha-b-i                 ya       mara

simple example is given in (97), where the generic roots ì ‘put’ and r ‘reach’ derive
complex verbs from the adjective root kul ‘white’ (see 3.5.1).(97)   kul-i-              ‘be white’                        kul-r-          ‘whiten’

referent is expressed in some cases by an obligatory possessor marking.(82)    ha-táng          beka                               ha-táng            abet

4.4.3     Demonstratives
As discussed in section 3.5.2, Abui demonstratives locate the referent in space or
discourse. The two functions of Abui demonstratives are distinguished syntactically.
This is illustrated in (83). In (a), the demonstrative do (PRX) refers to a proximate spatial
162                                        CHAPTER IV
location of the referent fala ‘house’. In (b), the same form refers to the proximate
discourse location of the same referent fala ‘house’.(83)   a. do            fala                                b. fala          do

           ‘this house (located by me)’                            ‘this house (I talk about)’This shows that those demonstratives that precede the head noun indicate its spatial
location; they are deictic demonstratives (DEICT). The demonstratives that follow the
head noun indicate its discourse location; they are anaphoric demonstratives (DEM).
Both functions are further discussed below. In Abui, both deictic demonstratives as
well as anaphoric demonstratives provide anchoring along a number of axes: SPEAKER-
ADDRESSEE, PROXIMAL-DISTAL, and HIGH-LOW (see also section 3.5.2.1). Two of these axes
apply to anaphoric demonstratives (SPEAKER-ADDRESSEE, PROXIMAL-DISTAL), and all three
of them apply to deictic demonstratives. In the remainder of this section, I deal with
both types of demonstratives. In section 4.4.3.1, I give an overview of the axis that
constitute Abui deictic system and exemplify the use of deictic demonstratives within
an NP. In 4.4.3.2, I discuss anaphoric demonstratives.","[184, 185]"

4.2.1      Possessive prefixes
Possessive prefixes express possessors. They are attached to a nominal root that
denotes the possessum. First and second person possessors are only expressed as
bound pronouns. Third person possessors are expressed as bound pronouns and
optionally as NPs. The Abui pronominal prefix inventory consists of three sets (see
section 3.3.2). In possessive constructions, only prefixes from sets I and III are
employed; they are listed in Table 17. As discussed in 3.3.2, sets I and III also combine
with verbal roots. Pronominal prefixes from set III express PATIENT arguments and
possessors of body parts. The formal parallel is based on the semantic parallel between
inalienable possession and PATIENT arguments. Both inalienably possessed items and
PAT(ient) arguments are under full control of the POSSESSOR and ACTOR respectively. The
nouns denoting body parts are bound roots that require possessive inflection: they are
inherently possessed. The pronominal prefixes from set III are glossed as INAL
(INALIENABLE) when they combine with nouns. Pronominal prefixes from set I indicate
LOC(ation) undergoer arguments and combine with free nominal roots to index the
possessor. They are glossed as AL (ALIENABLE).

forms contain [+high] [-back] vowel and the distinction between set I and III found in3 Abui possessive construction matches the general cross-linguistic pattern of the area. A closed set ofinherently possessed nouns and an open set of optionally possessed nouns are found also in other Papuan
languages of the Timor-Alor-Pantar group such as Teiwa (Klamer, In prep.), Klon (Baird, In prep.), Adang
(Haan 2001), Blagar (Steinhauer, p.c.) or Kui and Tanglapui (Nichols and Bickel 2005). Obligatory possessive
inflection has been reported for a number of languages from Papua mainland such as Hatam (Reesink 1999),
and Sougb (Reesink 2002); or Ekari, Dani, Asmat, Koiari (Nichols and Bickel 2005) and Amele (Roberts
1987).

singular is in plural neutralized. The distributive prefixes ta- and te- pattern as singular
forms. Singular and distributive forms of pronominal prefixes that belong to set III
terminate in vowel /ɑ/. This vowel is deleted when the pronominal prefix combines
with a bound nominal root that starts with a vowel, as illustrated in (17) in the
following section.","[163, 164]"
"  8.4.2.1       SVC with ng ‘see’
The generic verb ng ‘see’ occurs as a minor verb in SVCs encoding three related
grammatical functions. (i) In allative SVCs it expresses the goal location of a movement
or activity. (ii) In purpose SVCs it serves to express the purpose of an activity. It is, in
fact, expressed in the same way as the goal location in time, with the difference that
‘purpose’ is encoded as a specific argument with the LOC prefix as the U argument of
the minor verb ng ‘see’. (iii) The third function is different. The SVC is used to express
an experiencer. The ‘experiencer’ component is contributed by the semantics of the
minor verb ng ‘see’. The A argument of the minor verb ng ‘see’ expresses the non-
volitional actor of the whole construction. These three functions are discussed in turn
below:14 The monosegmental roots such as ng ‘see’, d ‘hold, get’ etc. are identified as verbs in Abui, because carryaspectual and person inflection and have the ability to derive new verbs from non-verbal roots, as discussed
in chapter 7. Cross-linguistically, adpositions inflecting for person are not found frequently, a know example
is Irish (cf. Noonan 2001; 2004). However, the other properties of the Abui roots indicate their verbhood.

ALLATIVE SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The first function of the minor verb ng ‘see’ is to
express the goal location of a movement. I will refer to this type of construction as
‘allative SVC’. The semantics of ng ‘see’ contains the direction component necessary to
refer to a goal.15 The goal location is realized as the U argument of the minor verb ng
‘see’. The A argument is shared by both serialized verbs. The allative SVC is
contiguous: no constituent may occur between the minor and major verb. The major
verb is usually a verb of motion or position. An example is given in (85) where the
‘allative’ SVC is contrasted with the monoverbal clause. In (a), the minor verb ng ‘see’
combines with the U argument ya ‘water’ that is interpreted as the goal location of the
motion expressed by the second verb. In (b), the verb sei ‘come down’ occurs in the A-
ULOC transitive construction. Its U argument is expressed with the LOC prefix he-
(3II.LOC) referring to the NP ya ‘water’. The U argument is interpreted as a specific
location, in this case a purpose.(85)    a. na ya=ng               sei                       b. na         ya      he-sei
             1SG water=see come.down                              1SG water 3II.LOC-come.down
             ‘I come down to water’                               ‘I come down for some water!’Note that the minor verb ng ‘see’ does not meet the requirements of the minimal
prosodic word. Therefore it forms a single prosodic word with its argument. In case of
a full NP argument, the minor verb combines with the last constituent of the NP such
as demonstratives, quantifiers, adjectives and state verbs (see also 4.4.5). The U
argument of the minor verb ng ‘see’ may be realized as a bound pronoun (pronominal
prefix). An example is given in (86). In (a), the major verb yaar-i ‘go’ combines with ng
‘see’. The U argument of the minor verb wata ‘coconut’ is specified by the REC prefix
on the verb. The REC prefix refers the NP wata ‘coconut’ that is interpreted as
[+individuated]. In result, the construction refers to motion to the ‘top’. In (b), ng ‘see’
is serialized with the verb mit-d-i ‘seat, get sitting’ to add the location argument
expressed with the NP kuda ‘horse’ and co-indexed with the REC prefix ho- (3II.REC).(86)    a. a         wata      ho-ng         yaar-i

the NP adi ‘sky’, which is co-indexed with the REC prefix ho- (3II.REC). It expresses the
goal location of the construction, a location to which the hand is shaken.","[399, 400]"
"   6.1.2.1    Person inflection and valence of free verb stems
In this section, I illustrate the variation in person inflection and valence on a sample of
free verb stems (stems that may occur without person inflection). The verbs mit ‘sit’,
yaa ‘go’, mong ‘die’, kil ‘detach’, paneng ‘make’, and marang ‘come up’ represent
various semantic verb classes discussed in 3.4.4.
        In examples (52)-(54), I illustrate that the verb mit ‘sit’ can occur as free stem
and also with various types of prefixes. In (52), three instances are given. In (a), the VP
combines with the free pronoun na (1SG) in an intransitive construction (see 6.2.4). In
(b), the VP consist of the head combined with the REC pronominal prefix no- (1SG.REC),
while in (c), a similar case is given for the third person. In (b, c), the verb mit ‘sit’ is
used in a A≡UREC experiencer construction (see 6.2.5.1) and has a reading of
unintentionally performed event.(52)    a. na        mit-i           b. no-mit-i          c.   Fan Malei do-mit-i

indexes the NP kalieta ‘old person’ in another type of A≡UPAT experiencer
construction (see 6.2.5.2). Because the NP kalieta is not co-indexed with the free

performed by the old man, but it was not his intention. As discussed in section 5.7.3,
this is a regular alternation in marking of the intransitive argument.(53)         kalieta           ma           he-n           da-mit-i

indexes the NP mayol kokda nu ‘that younger wife’ as the benefactive/location of
‘sitting’. The second argument is expressed with the NP mayol fing ‘first wife’ and co-
indexed with the LOC prefix e- (2SG.LOC) on the verb -d-o ‘hold’. It is unclear whether
this NP can be considered the A argument of the verb mit ‘sit’ (a case of A-ULOC
transitive construction as discussed in 6.2.2.2) or whether it should be considered as a
U argument.(54)         mayol fing,            e-d-o                  mayol kokda      nu        he-mit-i

the verb yaar ‘go’ heads a VP that contains only an aspectual suffix. The VP combines
with the free pronoun di (3A) that expresses the A argument (see also 6.2.4).(55)         yal   wala di yaar-i

free pronoun di (3A) and with the NP abui ‘mountain’ that expresses the location of the
motion in an A-U transitive construction (see 6.2.2.1). The reading of the construction
is ‘go up’ referring to the mountains above and around the village.3(56)         di abui            yaa     bataako he-tei

3 The direction of a motion may be expressed with an NP also in case of other motion verbs. As illustrated
in (1), the motion verb mara ‘go up’ combines with the NP melang ‘village’.(1)    ri     ko       ban-i                       ya   it-i     melang   mara

3.5.7    Question words
The last closed grammatical category contains question words. In Abui, question words
are forms such as nala ‘what’, maa ‘who’, te ‘where, how’, teina ‘when’ and yeng ‘how
much’. These forms always remain ‘in situ’; i.e. in the syntactic position of the
questioned constituent. The question word nala ‘what’ is used as default question word
referring to non-human entities. In (176), nala ‘what’ occurs in two different syntactic
positions. In (a), it occurs clause finally, questioning the identity of the referred object.
In (b), it occurs in the position of the U argument, questioning the complement of ong
‘make’.(176) a. {it        do}clause nala?              b. a         nala    ong?
         lie.CPL PRX             what                 2SG what         make
         ‘what is this (lying here)?’                 ‘what are you doing/making?’The question word nala may be used to question the species or kind of an entity. This
is illustrated in (177). In (a), the kind of a tree is questioned. In (b), the name of a place
is asked in a construction that involves a relative clause:(177) a. it     do      nala bataa?
         lie.on PRX what tree
         ‘what (kind of ) tree is this?’                                       [Note.007.01]

           ‘what is the name of this place/land?’                              [Note.010.01]The form nala ‘what’ can be used in both interrogative and indicative constructions.
Although both constructions have identical word orders, they are differentiated by their
intonational contour. In (176)-(177) nala ‘what’ is used in interrogative constructions.
In (178), the form nala is used to refer to non-specific entities and is translated as
‘something’. In both cases, the form nala expresses a non-specific U argument of the
verbs nee ‘eat’ and lakda ‘read’:

used to refer to animates. This is illustrated in (179). In (a), the speaker assumes a non-
human actor that caused a bite. In (b), the speaker assumes that the bite is caused by a
human.(179) a. nala e-l          takei?                     b. maa e-l                    takei?

However, the question nala ‘what’ can be used as well. This is illustrated in (180):(180) a. a-ne               nala?                b. a-ne                  maa?

the question word te ‘where’ is found in the position of the questioned constituent (in
situ). In both cases, the question word te ‘where’ combines with the location verb mi
‘be in’:(181) a. fe te          mi-a                   b. a        te        he-mi-a                 taa

direction of a motion is questioned. An example is given in (182), where the form
te=ng combines with the verb yaar ‘go’.(182) ma          e-d-o,             a te=ng      yaar-i?

specific, random location or direction of the event. This is illustrated in (183), where
the speaker expresses that somebody left for no matter where.

   8.4.4.1     SVC with ma ‘be.PRX’
The speaker-proximate event location is expressed with the minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’. An
example is given in (168) where the minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ combines with the verb yei
‘fall’ sharing a single argument. It refers to the location near the speaker where the
referred object ‘fell’:(168) di      ma         ha-yei?
      3A      be.PRX 3II.PAT-fall
      ‘did it fall here (by me)?’                                         [B05.083.02]Although both verbs in (168) have each their own argument, both pronouns expressing
the arguments have the same reference. The free pronoun di (3A) is the A argument of
the deictic verb ma ‘be.PRX’ while the PAT prefix ha- is the U argument of the verb yei
‘fall’. The minor verb in (168) expresses an event location while in (169) it expresses
potential modality. The minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ expresses an attitude of the speaker
towards the event expressed by the major verb. The major verb is inflected for aspect
with imperfective suffix -e (IPFV).(169) di      ma         do-làk-e
      3A      be.PRX     3I.REC-leave.for-IPFV

  8.4.4.2       SVC with ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
The minor verb ta ‘be.PRX.AD’ encodes the addressee-proximate location of the event.
This is illustrated in example (170) analogous to previous (168) where the minor verb ta
‘be.PRX.AD’ combines with the verb -yei ‘fall’ sharing a single argument:(170) di     ta           ha-yei?
      3A     be.PRX.AD 3II.PAT-fall
      ‘did he fall near you?’                                             [B05.083.02]In (171) both proximal deictic verbs are contrasted in the same SVC. Note that the
minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ used in a question presupposes the same location of the
speaker with the addressee as illustrated in (a). However, the minor verb ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
refers simply to the location of the addressee, regardless the location of speaker.
Logically the speaker is located elsewhere than the addressee in such situation because
otherwise the verb ma ‘be.PRX’ would be used:(171) a. anui ma              o-pa=ng                    sei?

   8.4.4.3     SVC with la ‘be.MD’
The minor verb la ‘be.MD’ expresses a medial (less proximate) event location with
respect to the speaker. The construction is used in situations when the speech
participants talk about events occurring in other locations that are distant from them.
This is illustrated in (100) where the speaker inquires whether the addressee is going to
stay over night in the harbour town encoded as la ‘be.MD’ or come back to the village
where they are both located at that time:(172) a       la        taa re a-wai?
      2SG be.MD lie            or 2SG.PAT-turn
      ‘will you sleep there or come back?’                                       [B04.009.02]In example (173) the minor verb la ‘be.MD’ is used in a very complex utterance that
uses a number of SVCs. Ignoring the first two clauses, in the third clause the minor
verb la ‘be.MD’ combines with the major verb yaari ‘go’, together with the other two
minor verbs pa ‘touch’ and ng ‘see’ expressing the motion towards a proximate
recipient. The minor verb la ‘be.MD’ is used to stress that the location where the
speaker ‘arrived’ is actually distant from his location at the moment of speech:(173) di       he-n          de-l          binen-r-i        ba      me     mai   se    na

       ‘he was getting ready for it to come when I arrived to him there’         [B07.037.03]The location verb SVC with the verb la ‘be.MD’ has a functional extension expressing
modality. It expresses speaker’s opinion that the event expressed with the major verb
happens ‘autonomously’ according its own will. The event is presented as ‘distant’ from
the speaker as illustrated in (174). The addressee is expressed as the A argument of the
minor verb la ‘be.MD’ and major verbs we ‘leave’ and me ‘come’. The speaker expresses
his lack of understanding why the addressee just keeps walking around:(174) a      la       we la           me do, a              nala tahai?
      2SG be.MD leave be.MD come PRX 2SG what search
      ‘you, you only go and come, so what are you searching?’                    [B05.033.03]In fact the minor verb la ‘be.MD’ indicates that the reported event is performed outside
the deictic centre, and ‘autonomously’ of speaker’s intention and awareness of its
reason; however, this construction can be analyzed as realis marking strategy as it
confirms that the event is truly happening. This is illustrated in (175) where (A) inquires
whether (B) is already asleep. (B) uses la ‘be.MD’ to express that he is unable to sleep.
He says that he is just lying ‘there’, while he is in the same location with the speaker.

takes place ‘autonomously’ of speaker’s expectation. In (176) the minor verb la ‘be.MD’
combines with yei ‘fall’ sharing a single argument wata ‘coconut’.(176) wata       la         ha-yei
      coconut be.MD 3II.PAT-fall
      ‘the coconut fell suddenly’                                                      [B07.073.01]
   8.4.4.4   SVC with fa ‘be.MD.AD’
The minor verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ refers to an event location distant from the addressee.
The use of fa implicates realis mode as it marks ‘truly’ occurring events. As realis mode
marker it has also contrastive epistemic function identifying that the information is
either new or unknown to the addressee. The verb fa corresponds roughly in its use to
English ‘actually’. In (101) it is contrasted with two other deictic verbs ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
and la ‘be.MD’ combined in all cases with the major verb sei ‘come down’:(177) a. anui ta                 sei?                      b. anui la            sei

of a questioned car. Note that the deictic verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ corresponds in usage to the
anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD).","[426, 427, 428, 429]"

3.3.2       Pronominal prefixes
In Abui, the bound pronouns are prefixed to nouns and verbs. Bound pronouns are
divided into three formally distinct sets. Pronominal prefixes are polysemous. They
combine with verbs to express the Undergoer (U) arguments and with nouns to express
possessors.4
        Pronominal prefixes from all three sets combine with verbs to express or co-
index the Undergoer (U) arguments. The U arguments identified as LOC (location) are
expressed with set I, REC (recipient) with set II, and PAT (patient) with set III (for more
details, see section 5.5). Pronominal prefixes from sets I and III combine also with
nouns. They express or co-index possessors (see 4.2). The prefixes from set III serve to
express possessor in inalienable possessive relations (INAL), set I is used to express
possessor in alienable possessive relations (AL). The prefixes from set I are
polysemous, they refer to locations and possessors. In fact, possessors are encoded as a
‘location’ of the possessed entity.5 An inalienably possessed body part is marked in the
same way as a PAT(ient) argument because both are fully controlled by the POSSESSOR4 Polysemous pronominal prefixes used in both nominal and verbal domain are found in other related Alor
Pantar languages such as Teiwa (Klamer and Kratochvíl, 2006; Klamer, In prep.), and Adang (cf. Haan
2001:38, 46). Steltenpool and Stap (1959) report polysemous prefixes for Ekari (referred to as Kapauku), a
language from the Wissel Lakes-Kemandoga group of the TNG family. They observe a similarity between
possessor marking on body parts and kinship terms and the object marking: ‘considering the extremely
passive nature of the acquisition of such ‘possession’ it is not a coincidence that these prefixes are reminiscent
of the passive voice’ (Steltenpool and Stap, 1958:20, translation F.K.).
5 Polysemous pronominal possessor and benefactive markers are also found in Lower Grand Valley Dani(Bromley 1981:190). Lichtenberk (2002) and Margetts (2004) argue for possessive-benefactive polysemy in
broader cross-linguistic perspective.

4.4.5      Combinations of adnominal modifiers
The order of adnominal modifiers in an NP is fixed. As discussed in section 4.4, only
the deictic demonstratives (DEICT) precede the head noun; other modifiers follow the
head noun. The order of modifiers is schematically represented in (98), which is a
repetition of the same scheme given in (67):
7The Malay word kepala adat refers to the ‘head of custom, habbits’; that is somebody with the traditional
knowledge who is able to negotiate and enter various contracts in a culturally recognized way.

immediately follow the head noun. They are followed by adjectives and stative verbs
(ADJ/V), quantifiers (QUANT), and anaphoric demonstratives (DEM). A number of
examples of complex noun phrases are given in (99). In all cases, stative verbs precede
quantifiers; the anaphoric demonstratives are the right most modifiers. In cases when
anaphoric demonstratives co-occur with quantifiers, the quantifiers have to precede
them:       DEICT N          V           QUANT                 DEICT       N          V            DEM

Anaphoric demonstratives (DEM) signal the end of an NP. This is illustrated in (100). In
the left-hand column, a verb follows the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) and is
interpreted as the constituent head of a VP. In the right-hand column, the verb is
followed by the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) and is interpreted as an NP modifier.
This proves that the anaphoric demonstratives are the right-most constituents.

            ‘this house is big’                          ‘this big house’Quantifiers are the second right-most adnominal modifiers. In an NP, they are
preceded by stative verbs and adjectives. When quantifiers are not followed by an
anaphoric demonstrative, they signal the end of an NP. As illustrated in (101) the
stative verb foka ‘be big’ must precede the quantifier ayoku ‘two’ in order to be
interpreted as an adnominal modifier (b). When the stative verb foka ‘be big’ follows
the numeral, it is interpreted as a VP head (a).","[189, 190, 191]"
"5 There are also a number of ‘Papuan’ languages spoken on Timor claimed to belong to the same branch ofthe TNG family such as Bunak, Fataluku, Makasae, Makalero, and on the Southwest Moluccan island of
Kirsar Oirata.
6 Austronesian migration to the area started less than 4,000 years ago; however, much less is know about themigrations of the Papuan population. Almost certainly the Papuan languages represent populations that have
been in the New Guinea area much longer than the Austronesian population. Earliest archeological evidence
dates the human settlement to as early as 50,000 years ago. Australia and New Guinea are part of the same
continental shelf called Sahul. As the seas were low during the last ice age period, both the Australian
mainland and New Guinea were joined by a land bridge into one continental area (Sahul) until about 8,000
years ago, when the rising seas overflowed the lowlands and separated the large continent. This means that till
about 8,000 years ago, the ancient population was able to migrate accros the area (cf. Foley, 1986:269,
Spriggs, 1998:932-3). The Timor-Alor-Pantar area was separated from this land mass by a relatively narrow
strait (about 90 km). The area where the Sahul shelf drops into deep sea is referred to as Lynedekker’s Line. It
defines the eastern boundary of a biogeografical area known as Wallacea to which Timor-Alor-Pantar
belongs. In the west, Wallacea is separated from the Sunda area by the Wallace line.

singular (i grade) form are preserved in Abui. The u grade form is not found. Abui
inclusive pronoun pi (1PL.I) is related to the innovative inclusive form *bi found in
other languages of the West TNG linkage (Ross, 2005:36). However, it may also be
related to proto TNG dual inclusive suffix *-p-. The second person singular form is
clearly related to the proto TNG form. The second plural form ri (2PL) seems to be an
innovation. Abui third person pronoun di (3A) seems to be an innovation too. The
proto-TNG dual suffix *-t may be related to Abui distributive pronouns, which have
either reciprocal or distributive reading.
        According to Pawley (1998:683), lexical evidence to assign Timor-Alor-Pantar
languages to the TNG family is weak. Pawley (2001) gives a list of 98 reconstructed
proto-TNG forms and adds some more in (2005-b), together about 200 items. In Table
2, I give 31 corresponding Abui forms, that were selected according to their form and
meaning, as described by Pawley. I also took in consideration the outcomes in other
TNG languages, as listed in Pawley (2001). The left-hand column refers to Pawley’s
numbering of the reconstructed protoforms, the last five forms are not numbered, they
are listed in Pawley (2005-b). It is followed by the form itself in the second column.
The cognate Abui form is given in the third column. The fourth column gives
outcomes in other languages of the TNG family, as listed in Pawley (2001), that are
similar to the Abui form.","[29, 30]"
"NOUNS. Abui nouns are only identified unambiguously by their referential properties
when they have animate referents. Inanimate nouns are typically underspecified for
number, shape, or size; in other words, their reference is generic. Many lexical items are
categorially indetermined and may refer to objects and substances as well as to events.
         Abui nouns are divided in two groups by possessive inflection. Inherently
possessed nouns require possessive inflection. Semantically these are body parts and
kinship terms. This distinction is illustrated in (3), where the bound nominal stem min
‘nose’ combines with the inalienable possessive prefix na- (1SG.INAL). In (b), the noun
fala ‘house’ belongs to the second group of optionally possessed nouns. The possessive
prefix ne- (1SG.AL) marks the alienable possession. In third person, the possessor is
optionally expressed with a noun that precedes the possessum denoting noun, as
illustrated in (c).(3)    a. na-min                         b. ne-fala               c.   maama he-fala

(PROPOSS), with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives

and anaphoric demonstratives (DEM) in a fixed order, as illustrated in (4).","[36, 37]"

15The allative marker function of the verb ‘see’ is a known grammaticalization path (cf. Heine and Kuteva
2002). It encodes a direction or a goal location. The allative use of the general verb of perception ‘see,
perceive’ is found also in Dani, another remotely related Papuan language of West Papua (Bromley 1981:107-
112).

serialized with yaa ‘go’.(88)   a       he-ng          yaa       tadeng      yen-r-a?

This is illustrated in (89) where the major verb nat-i ‘stand’ combines with the
completive n ‘see’ in an allative SVC. Note that this is not an instance of assimilation as
assimilation of place of articulation across the word boundary is not found in Abui:(89)   tikonrek mi          he-n                  nat-i-a            naha

Although both roots are related, but it is snot entirely clear to me, what determines

combines with the noun ui ‘back’. In (c-d), the verb munang ‘smell at’ combines with
the completive stem ién ‘see’. The stem ién carries aspectual inflection and together
with the main verb refers to ‘smelling at someone’ or ‘kissing’. In both (c-d) the

        PURPOSE SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The second function of the minor verb ng ‘see’
is to express the purpose of an event. The purpose is expressed as the U argument of
the completive stem of the minor verb n ‘see’ with the LOC prefix and interpreted as a
specific ‘location’=purpose. The completive stem n ‘see’ must be used. The LOC prefix
is obligatory as the ‘purpose’ is identified as specific. An example is given in (94) where
n ‘see’ is serialized with fanga ‘say’. The pronominal prefix he- (3II.LOC) expresses the
purpose matter for which has to be ‘asked’:(94)   a     he-n                fanga

Another example is given in (95) where the verbs latih-d-i ‘exercise’ and n ‘see’
combine in a purpose SVC. Both verbs share a (2SG) as their A argument, but each of
them has its own U argument. The LOC prefix on the verb n ‘see’ refers to the purpose
of ‘exercise’ while the LOC prefix on the verb latih-d-i ‘exercise’ refers to the matter to
be ‘exercised’. It typically refers to another clause that occurs in preceding context, or if
used in conversation.(95)   a     he-n             he-latih-d-i                he-ari-d-a

verb ng ‘see’ used as minor verb differs somewhat from the previous two. The main
function of this construction is to express an experiencer. It is realized as the A
argument of the minor verb ng ‘see’ and shared with the major verb. The generic verb
ng ‘see’ specifies the A argument as an experiencer. An example is given in (96) where
the single participant is realized as a NP Simon and free pronoun di (3A) shared by ng
‘see’ and wahai ‘look’:(96)   Simon      di=ng wahai
       name      3A=see look
       ‘Simon looks, sees’Non-volitional actor SVCs are typically used to express an active experiencer of mental
or bodily processes (see also 6.2.5). In SVCs given in (97) the A argument of the minor
verb and the U argument of the major verb have the same referent.(97)   a. a=ng         a-yonfi                        b. na=ng na-ruida

as illustrated in (98). In (a), a transitive A≡<ULOC>≡UPAT experiencer construction is
used (see 6.2.5.5). In (b), a standard A-UPAT transitive construction is used (see 6.2.2.4).
In (c), the verb wahai ‘look’ occurs in a standard A-ULOC transitive construction (see
6.2.2.2).

  8.4.2.2      SVC with d ‘get, hold’
The minor verb d ‘get, hold’ has a number of grammatical functions: (i) in comitative
SVCs it expresses the accompanied participant; (ii) in attributive SVCs it expresses the
participant with a certain property, (iii) in focus SVCs it serves to express the focused
participant. These three functions of the minor verb d ‘hold, get’ are discussed in turn
below:
         COMITATIVE SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The first function of the minor verb d ‘hold,
get’ is to express the accompanied participant affected by the course of the event
performed by the acting (human) participant. The generic verb d ‘hold, get’ contributes
the semantic component synonymous to ‘with’ or ‘accompany’. The accompanied
(mostly animate) participant is realized as the U argument of the minor verb d ‘hold,
get’ and expressed with the PAT prefix in an A-UPAT transitive construction (see 6.2.2.4).
One argument (typically A) is shared by both serialized verbs. The comitative SVC is
contiguous. The major verb is usually a verb of motion or position. An example is
given in (103). The minor verb d ‘hold’ is serialized with the verb muila ‘play’. The NP
Fani is the shared A argument of both verbs. The U argument of the verb d-a ‘hold,
get’ is expressed with the PAT prefix ha- (3II.PAT) referring to the NP kamai ‘cat’.","[400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405]"

                                   2 Phonology
In this chapter, I give an overview of Abui phonology. In other words, I discuss the
different sounds of the language and how they are combined together. The data
presented in this chapter are from the Takalelang, Alila and Tifol Afeng dialect. In a
small number of cases, data from the Fanating dialect are used. These cases are
explicitly marked.
         This chapter is organized as follows: in section 2.1.1, the phonemic inventory of
Abui is discussed. The distribution of the phonemes within words and syllables are
described in 2.2, with subsections for consonants (2.2.1) and vowels (2.2.2). Syllable
structure is described in 2.3 and further referred to in 2.4 where I give an overview of
prosodic word types. In a prosodic word, syllables are stressed following the iambic
pattern (2.5); a penultimate heavy syllable causes the final syllable to be extrametrical
(2.5.3). A small number of Abui word has lexical tone (2.5.4). This chapter ends in 2.6
with an overview of orthographic conventions used in this grammar.","[47, 48]"
"   7.2.1.2     Heterogeneous complex verbs with bound verbal roots
Another large set of CV consist of a bound verbal root combined with one or more
generic roots. In (23) and (25), the bound roots obligatorily combine with the root a ‘be
at’ when used as modifiers in an NP, or as a predicate in a mono-verbal clause. This is a
characteristic distributional property of one subset of stative verbs. Observe that the
root a ‘be at’ may replaced by the root d ‘hold, get’. The CV with the root d ‘hold, get’
refers to events with an actor participant.(23)   bek-a             ‘be bad’                        fok-a               ‘be big’

stative verb fok-a ‘be big’ typically occurs in intransitive construction, while other forms
show variation between intransitive (b) and transitive (c-f).(24)   a. ne-fala          fok-a         naha

combines with a single argument tipai ‘iron’. In (b), the verb lil-r-i ‘heat up’ combines
with the U argument ya ‘water’ that is co-indexed with the PAT prefix ha- (3II.PAT)on the

pi (1PL.I) that occurs in the following clause.

verbs, as illustrated in (29). As in the previous examples the generic root a ‘be at’
derives a stative verb. Generic root d ‘hold, get’ derives a CV referring to internally
caused change of state or condition. Generic root ng ‘see’ indicates that the referred
event is oriented towards a location (human location is interpreted as an experiencer). A
number of generic roots were not discussed before. The generic root i ‘put’ seems to
derive accomplishment verbs. The CV stems tak-i ‘escape, flee’ and aha-i ‘put outside,
put on the edge’ refer to accomplishments or resultant state of change. The state that
was accomplished is expressed by the bound verbal root. Note also that the generic
root f ‘sever’ may be used to indicate a removed undergoer participant, as illustrated in
(29), by the CV stem tak-a-f- ‘stolen’. The function of the generic root f ‘sever’
contrasts with the root m ‘be in’ as illustrated by the CV stem aha-m- ‘remain’. The
generic verb k ‘bring’ derives a CV referring to a change of state or condition that is not
directly brought about by an actor or the actor is somewhat remote and affects the
undergoer by a motion. Usually the verb k ‘bring’ alternates with t ‘lie’, which indicates
that the change of state or condition, or the motion was accomplished.(29)   tak-a             ‘be empty, be only’            aha              ‘be outside’

it is used as the main predicate of an imperative clause. It combines with the
pronominal prefix ha- co-indexing the NP pakai foka ‘big basket’. The CV tak-d-
combines obligatory either with perfective or durative suffix. In addition to that, here
the inceptive marker te (INCP.C) follows the stem that is occurs in A-UPAT transitive
construction. In (b), it combines in serial verb construction with the verb nee ‘eat’ to
refer to an event of ‘eating up’.(31)   a. pakai         foka          nu        ha-tak-d-i=te

construction. It refers to ‘drying out’ of a large body of water, translated as ‘lake’ here.
The CV tak-a-t- ‘be dry, be emptied’ is derived with the generic verb t ‘lie’ that refers to
a resultant state event which involves an undergoer participant (mostly a location). The
CV combines with the perfective suffix -i (PFV). The verb tak-a-t- is serialized with the
verbs mi ‘be in’ and ng ‘see’ that indicate an interior location, the structure mi=ng tak-
a-t-i can be translated as ‘emptied inside’. The verb n ‘see’ that precedes them takes the
first clause as its complement, co-indexing it with the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC) to express
the temporal location of ‘emptying’.(37)   di     sei                 aka        mi-a            yo          wal   do

For details about serial verb constructions with generic verbs ng ‘see’ and m ‘be in,

combines with a single argument he-ya ‘his water (bamboo tube)’ that got empty,
waterless, while the child that was carrying it went to search for some nuts. As in the
previous example the generic verb n ‘see’ is used in serial verb construction with the
verb tak-a-d-i. It refers to the location of water which is in this case a bamboo tube.(38)   di      we      de-ya         do      he-wahai=si            he-ya

       ‘he went away, he just looked at his water (bamboo tube), and his water, it got empty’In (116), a complex paradigm of verbs is given. These verbs are derived from the root
aku ‘be dark, not see’. The generic verb k ‘bring’ derives verbs that refer to events
during which an undergoer participant is affected by a motion or undergoes a change of

with the generic verb t ‘lie’ that refer to events in which the undergoer participant is in
a resultant state of a motion.(39)   aku-ng           ‘darken’                         aku-n         ‘already dark’

all cases, the complex verbs function as a single predicate in a clause, combining with
two arguments. Observe that the generic verb d ‘hold, get’ derives an A oriented verb,
stressing the ability of the actor to make a chair. The generic verbs l ‘give’ and r ‘reach’
derive a U oriented verb, focuses on the result of the activity.(43)   a. akun=te           na      kadera na-l

manner, in which the event is performed. Some of the reduplicated forms were
illustrated in (7) and (24).

7.2.2      Heterogeneous complex verbs with adjectival roots
In Abui, the class of adjectives is closed (see 3.5.1). As illustrated in (46), Abui adjectival
roots combine with a number of generic roots.8 Note that the adjectival root kul ‘white’
has to combine with the generic root i ‘put’ or with r ‘reach’ if it is to function
predicatively. As in previous cases, the generic verb d ‘hold’ derives a verb referring to a
change of state achieved by the actor and usually affecting him. The verb r ‘reach’ refers
again to a change of state affecting an undergoer and usually brought about by an actor.
The generic verb ì/i ‘put’ typically derives an accomplishment verb where the
participant is in certain state, without focusing how the state was reached.(46)     abet-d-              ‘become young’                 san-r-                   ‘ripen’

         dirty-reach                                         black-reachThe use of the CVs containing an adjectival root is illustrated in (47). In (a), the
adjective dakun ‘dirty’ combines with the generic root r ‘reach’ in a CV. In (b), the
adjective kul ‘while’ combines with the generic root i ‘put’ in an CV expressing
accomplishment of ‘being white’.(47)     a. e-konrek          dakun-r-i              hare, lan=te

8 Abui CVs containing an adjectival or verbal root show richer derivational morphology, than other Papuan
languages, such as Kobon, as more verbs are allowed. In Kobon, adjectives such as ‘big’, ‘bent’, ‘cold’ or ‘bad’
typically combine with ‘do’ (Davies 1984:202).

7.2.3      Heterogeneous complex verbs with nominal roots
There is a group of CVs that consist of a free nominal root combined with a generic
verb root. This group is relatively small as illustrated in (48) and (51).9 The nominal
roots combine with the generic root l ‘give’. The derived verbs refer to events during
which an undergoer is affected in the way described by the noun. The nominal root
wayang ‘paddle n., row n.’ combines with the generic root d ‘hold, get’ to refer the
event that contains an actor participant. In this case the correspondence is with the
activity of ‘paddling’ or ‘rowing’ in quite literal; it is described as ‘holding’ of a ‘paddle’,
cf. English ‘to row’, ‘to paddle’. The nominal root -wa ‘mouth’ is bound. It may
combine with the generic root ng ‘see’ to refer to an event that contains an undergoer
participant (experiencer); it refers to ‘greeting’.(48)    piei-l-           ‘to dream’                   mui-l-                 ‘to play’

alternated when the CV combines with perfective suffix -i (PFV). In (d), the usage of the
noun namu ‘wound’ is illustrated.(49)    a. nawet                    namu-l

pronominal prefixes. The REC prefix no- (1SG.REC) expresses the recipient of greeting,
the PAT distributive prefix encodes the reciprocity of greeting. In (b), the nominal use
of the root -wa ‘mouth’ is illustrated. Note that the noun -wa ‘mouth’ is obligatorily
possessed.","[328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]"

In (198), the verb akun ‘be dark’ is incorporated in a complex verb headed by the verb
d ‘hold, get’. It combines with two aspectual markers and precedes the modified VP ho-
kariang ‘work for him’ and its argument na ‘1SG’.(198) akun-d-i=se             na ho-kariang yal do             na kabei ahel=te

refers to an ongoing event of being dark. The completive stem refers to an event of
‘being dark’ that has a final point an can be interpreted as a ‘morning’ or a ‘day’.  6.3.3.7    afe ‘pass’
The adverbial modifier afe ‘pass’ indicates an event that occurred in unspecified past. It
occurs in the left-edge of a relative clause preceding the verb luk ‘rub’, as illustrated in
(199). The adverb wan ‘already’ is a part of the main clause.(199) ama      ba     afe ta-luk-u                   wan     to-mi             nuk-d-i

      ‘people that were fighting are already reconciled’                       [B10.046.07]In (200), afe ‘pass’ combines in a possessive construction with the NP tung ayoku ‘two
years’ to refer to an event that occurred two years ago, suggesting that afe ‘pass’ serves
here as a nominal that can be translated as ‘past’.(200) afe he-tung         ayoku      di miei

contexts similar to (200). Note that afe ‘pass’ precedes the nouns tung ‘year’ in (b) and
war ‘sun’ in (c). It is located in the same position as deictic demonstratives in the NP
and its function is related to that of deictic demonstratives in the sense that it indicates
the location of a period in time. This is not surprising, because Abui NP structure and
VP structure are largely parallel.(201) a. afe     he-tung nuku                       b. afe        tung

There is a preference for a clause to contain maximally one adverbial modifier.
However, in a number of cases, a single clause contains two adverbial modifiers as
illustrated in the following examples. In (204), the adverb yal combines with the adverb
wala ‘be so’:(204) yal wala          di làk-i

This section discusses the morphological make-up of a word. In Abui, a word is
defined as a unit by its phonological and distributional properties. A word is a unit
characterized by its prosodic properties such as stress that is generally borne by the
final syllable of a word. A word is a minimal free form.
        Abui words may consist of one or more morphemes. A number of mono-
morphemic words are given in (1). The words in the first row refer to time stable

as ‘free roots’. Words may consist of more than one morpheme; a number of examples
are given in (2). A number of free roots (a, c, d) from the first row in (1) combine with
other elements into morphologically complex words. In (b) the form -táng ‘hand’ is a
bound morpheme that cannot appear independently in a clause.(2)    a. ne-fe              b. na-táng             c.   e-lui               d. he-maama

maama ‘father’, and in front of the bound root -táng ‘hand’. These pronominal forms
do not occur independently in a clause. They are bound morphemes and are prefixes
since they always occur in front of roots. In (2), the pronominal prefixes combine with
the free roots fe ‘pig’, lui ‘knife’, and maama ‘father’, to express the possessor in (a, c,
d). In (b), the bound form *táng ‘hand’ obligatorily combines with a pronominal prefix;
in this case it combines with the prefix na- (1SG.INAL).
        The forms that refer to events may combine with other morphemes. Observe
the morphological structures in (3).(3)    a. nee-i                     b. ha-bui-d-a                            c.      na-lal-e

           ‘already eaten’                 ‘get it shortened’                        ‘I am laughing’In (a), the free morpheme nee followed by the suffix -i (PFV) that marks aspect. This
aspectual marker is a bound morpheme. It occurs only attached to other morphemes.
In (b), the free morpheme bui ‘be short’ combines with the pronominal prefix ha-
(3II.PAT) and with the morpheme d ‘hold, get’. The morpheme d ‘hold, get’ is bound. It
obligatorily combines with other constituents, such as bui ‘be short’, or with
pronominal prefixes. It is followed by the aspectual suffix -a (DUR) that has the same
distributional properties as the perfective suffix -i (PFV). Finally, in (c), the morpheme
lal ‘laugh’ is a bound root that obligatorily combines with pronominal prefixes, in this
case na- (1SG.PAT). The bound root lal ‘laugh’ may be combined with the suffix -e
(IPFV).

         From the presented data, we can construct a number of morphological
templates of Abui words. They are listed in (4) and represent the possible
morphological structures of Abui words. Abui words consist minimally of a free root
(i). Free roots may combine with optional morphemes, either prefixes (ii) or suffixes
(iii), or with both (iv). They may form a complex stem with a bound root and be
combined with affixes (v). There are also bound roots. To form a word, bound roots
obligatorily combine with prefixes (vi), suffixes (vii) or other bound roots (viii).","[90, 91, 92]"
"       5.8      Development of Abui bound pronouns
Abui pronouns seem to be cognate to the pronominal forms found in other Papuan
languages of Alor-Pantar area. The formal relation goes even further to the mainland
languages of the Trans New Guinea family (TNG), cf. section 1.6. The reconstructed
proto-TNG forms *na and *ka (Foley, 2000) are found in 1st and 2nd singular
respectively and in 1st plural. The velar proto-TNG root [k] indicating second person is
possibly related to Abui glottal [ʔ] that characterizes second person singular. In Papuan
languages, the singular vs. plural number is indicated by the vowel alternation *a ~*i
(cf. Foley, 2000:362; Ross, 2006:29); in Abui, this alternation is found as well. In (Ross
2005), a reconstructed inclusive suffix *-p is given. It is possible that this form is also
the source of Abui inclusive forms pi (1PL.I), po-/pu- (1PL U arguments), and pi- (1PL U
arguments and possessors).
        There is cross-linguistic evidence that diachronically the pronouns were
morphologically complex. The consonant roots identify the person while the vowel
roots mark the number (cf. Foley, 2000:362). In Abui these basic composed
pronominal forms fused later with the generic verbs *a ‘be at’, *e ‘add, continue’, and *o
‘point’ (cf. Klamer and Kratochvíl 2006). In (60), I illustrate the development for
206                                           CHAPTER V
singular bound pronouns. In all given cases, the vowel root [ɑ] that codes the singular
number was deleted. The pronominal form and the generic verb fused into a single
morpheme and became grammaticalized as prefixes.5(60)     a. *n-a-a           fanga      >     *n-a=fanga                >     na-fanga

             ‘tell/order me’
         b. *h-a-e           fanga      >     *h-e=fanga                >     he-fanga

         c. *n-a-o           fanga      >     *n-o=fanga                >     no-fanga

             ‘scold me’In (61), the development of the plural forms is shown.(61)     a. *n-i-a           fanga      >     *n-i=fanga                >     ni-fanga

             ‘tell/order us’
         b. *n-i-e           l          >     *n-i=l                    >     ni-l

             ‘give us’
         c. *r-i-o           sei        >     *r-o=sei                  >       ro-sei
             2-PL-point     come.down         2PL-point=come.down               2PL.REC-come.down
             ‘you (PL) return down’As illustrated in (a), the vowel [ɑ] deletion process applied. The high front vowel was
preserved. In (b), the high vowel fused with the lower vowel and was preserved. The
resulting prefix has the same form as the PAT prefix. In (c), the high front vowel was
deleted resulting in the REC prefix ro-, or in other dialects ru-. The vowel alternation
seems to reflect the diachronic development. In sum, (60) and (61) suggest that the
pronominal prefixes originate from a serial verb construction. Although this might
seem unlikely at the first sight, there are other serial constructions reminiscent of these
proposed constructions (see 8.4.2). The possessive prefixes developed along the same
path as shown in (62).(62)     a. *n-a-a           táng       >     *n-a=táng             >       na-táng
             1-SG-be.at      hand             1SG-be.at=hand                1SG.INAL-hand
             ‘my hand’
5 In Abui, the vowel deletion still applies when a stem without word-initial onset combines with a pronominalprefix containing the vowel [ɑ], as discussed in section 2.5.6, in particular example (101).

       Samenvatting in het Nederlands
Spraakkunst van het Abui, een Alorese taalDit boek is een beschrijving van het Abui, één van de meer dan een dozijn talen
gesproken op het eiland Alor, in Oost-Indonesië. De sprekers van het Abui leven in het
bergachtige hart van het eiland. De taal wordt gesproken door ongeveer 16.000 mensen
en kent een aantal dialecten. Dit boek is een beschrijving van de noordelijkste dialecten
Takalelang, Tifolafeng en Alila. Abui is een Papua taal, en is niet verwant met de
Austronesische talen van de omliggende eilanden. Abui is verwant met de talen van de
Trans-New-Guinea taalfamilie, die voornamelijk gesproken worden op het eiland
Nieuw Guinea. Alor ligt op een oeroude migratieroute naar Australie en Nieuw Guinea,
maar de precize informatie over de migraties ontbreekt nog.
         Dit boek bestrijkt verschillende gebieden van het Abui. Op het
introductiehoofdstuk volgt de klankleer (fonologie) in hoofdstuk 2. Abui heeft de
volgende medeklinkers: b, p, m, w, f, d, t, n, s, l, r, j (geschreven as y), ŋ (geschreven als
ng), k, ʔ, h, en een aantal medeklinkers onlangs geleend met de woorden uit het Maleis:
c, g, en ɟ (geschreven als j). Er zijn vijf klinkers: ɑ, ɛ, ɪ, ɔ, ʊ die met gewone letters a, e,
i, o, en u, worden geschreven. Allemaal hebben ze lange klinkers als tegenhanger. Deze
lange klinkers worden met twee letters gescheven: aa [ɑː], ee [ɛː], ii [ɪː], oo [ɔː], uu [ʊː].
Binnen de lettergreep vinden we niet meerdere medeklinkers naast elkaar. Dergelijke
medeklinkerclusters worden vermeden; soms worden in morfologisch complexe
structuren klinkers toegevoegd om de clusters te vermijden. Naast lange klinkers, is het
mogelijk twee verschillende klinkers te combineren binnen dezelfde lettergreep. Zulke
lettergrepen worden altijd beklemtoond. Het basisklemtoonpatroon is jambisch, geteld
van het einde van het woord. Uitzonderingen vormen de woorden met een zwaare
voorlaatste lettergreep, want die trekt de klemtoon aan. Naast de klemtoon en de lengte
kunnen de lettergrepen ook nog in toon verschillen zoals fír [fɪ̀r] ‘ster’ en fir [fɪ́r]
‘haasten’. De woorden met een hoge toon worden gemarkeerd met het accent aigu teken.
Abui naamwoorden hebben maximaal drie lettergrepen, maar de werkwoorden kunnen
langer zijn.
         Hoofdstuk 3 behandelt Abui woordsoorten. Het begint met een bespreking van
de woordbouw. Abui is een agglutinerende taal; dat betekent dat een woord uit een
aantal wortels, voor- en achtervoegsels kan bestaan. De naamwoorden hebben meestal
een simpele morfologische structuur. Er zijn geen naamvallen, en geen uitgangen voor
enkelvoud en meervoud. De naamwoorden die naar lichaamsdelen verwijzen, krijgen
meestal een voorvoegsel dat naar de bezitter verwijst. Voor de meerderheid van deze
woorden is zo’n voorvoegsel verplicht. De morfologie van de werkwoorden is in het
algemeen meer complex dan die van naamwooden. Werkwoordelijke stammen kunnen
combineren met (maximaal) twee voornaamwoordelijke voorvoegsels en drie
achtervoegsels voor aspect. Zowel de voorvoegsels als de achtervoegsels kunnen
verplicht zijn. Werkwoordelijke samenstellingen komen veel voor: hoofdstuk 7 is er
volledig aan gewijd.
538                          SAMENVATTING IN HET NEDERLANDS
        Het tweede deel van hoofdstuk 3 geeft een overzicht van Abui woordstoorten,
die verdeeld worden in open en gesloten klassen. Naamwoorden en werkwoorden
behoren tot de open klassen. De gesloten klassen zijn bijvoeglijke naamwoorden,
bijwoorden, demonstratieven, telwoorden, voegwoorden, en vraagwoorden.
Werkwoordelijke en naamwoordelijke stammen kunnen niet altijd van elkaar worden
onderscheiden. Bijvoorbeeld de stam yaa betekent zowel ‘gaan’, als ‘weg, pad’; en de
stam tanga betekent ‘spreken’ en ‘spraak, taal’. Voor een ‘Papua’ taal is zulke
ambiguïteit ongebruikelijk, maar in de omliggende Austronesische talen komt het vaker
voor.
        Hoofdstuk 4 behandelt de Abui naamwoorden. Naast naamwoorden die naar
mensen en plaatsen verwijzen, kent het Abui naamwoorden, die naar substanties en
naar concrete voorwerpen verwijzen. Deze naamwoorden komen vaak voor als een lid
van een samenstelling of worden in een naamwoordsgroep (Noun Phrase, NP) gevolgd
door een ander naamwoord. In beide gevallen wordt hun referentie nader bepaald door
het andere lid van de samenstelling of de woordgroep.
        De Abui naamwoordgroep heeft een vaste woordvolgorde. In het algemeen is
het eerste lid het hoofd. Alleen aanwijzende voornaamwoorden (deictic demonstratives), en
bezittelijke voornaamwoorden gaan aan het hoofd vooraf. Andere leden van de NP
volgen op het hoofd: naamwoorden, bijvoegelijke naamwoorden of statieve
werkwoorden, telwoorden en aanwijzende voornaamwoorden (anaphoric demonstratives).
Daarnaast bestaat de mogelijkheid om een betrekkelijke bijzin of een ander zinsdeel aan
het hoofdnomen te koppelen door middel van het voegwoord ba (LNK) dat ook zinnen
aan elkaar ‘linkt’. Het opmerkelijke is dat een dusdanig gekoppeld zinsdeel zich op de
plaats van zijn eenvoudige tegenhanger bevindt. Dus bijzinnen die de locatie of bezitter
uitdrukken staan voor het hoofd en alle andere volgen erop.
        Hoofdstuk 5 bespreekt de manier waarop de argumenten van een
werkwoordelijk gezegde uitgedrukt worden. In deze beschrijving worden niet de
traditionele termen onderwerp (subject) en lijdend voorwerp (object) gebruikt, maar de
noties Actor (A) argument versus Undergoer (U) argument. De motivatie hiervoor is dat de
wijze waarop een argument uitgedrukt wordt, niet puur grammaticaal bepaald is, maar
vooral afhankelijk is van de semantische eigenschappen van de participanten van een
gebeurtenis. Deelnemers die actief participeren in de gebeurtenis worden als het A
argument uitgedrukt in transitieve en in intransitive constructies. Dat wil dus zeggen dat
in na wan sieng neei ‘ik heb al rijst gegeten’, de eerste persoon enkelvoud participant
op dezelfde manier wordt uitgedrukt als de eerste persoon enkelvoud deelnemer in na
wan firai ‘ik heb al gerend’: allebei met het voornaamwoord na. Maar wanneer
deelnemers niet actief deelnemen, en een gebeurtenis meer ‘ondergaan’, dan worden ze
als een U argument uitgedrukt, door middel van een voornaamwoordelijk voorvoegsel
in plaats van een vrijstaand voornaamwoord. Dus de eerste persoon enkelvoud
deelnemer in di wan na-weli ‘hij heeft mij gewassen’ wordt met een voorvoegsel
uitgedrukt, op dezelfde manier als in wan na-riki ‘ik ben geworden’. De deelnemers in
gebeurtenissen als na wan naweli ‘ik heb me al gewassen’ worden zowel met het A
argument als met het U argument uitgedrukt zoals ook het geval is in vergelijkbare
constructies in het Nederlands of Engels.
        Er zijn drie verschillende typen verbuigingen voor de voornaamwoordelijke
voorvoegsels die het U argument uitdrukken. De voorvoegsels met met de klinker e in
het enkelvoud en een i in het meervoud verwijzen naar een locatie of belanghebbende
                              SAMENVATTING IN HET NEDERLANDS                          539
(location/benefactive). De voorvoegsels met een o in het enkelvoud en een u in het
meervoud drukken altijd een ontvanger (recipient) uit. De voorvoegsels met de klinker a
in het enkelvoud en een i in het meervoud drukken de participant uit die het minst
actief is en het meest een ‘lijdend’ voorwerp is (patient). Sommige werkwoorden kunnen
combineren met alle drie de voorvoegsels. Het werkwoord loi ‘verwijderen, wegleggen’,
bijvoorbeeld, combineert met he- in kaai he-loi ‘een hond blaft erop’. In deze zin
verwijst he- naar een plaats. In kaai ho-loi ‘een hond blaft op hem’, verwijst ho- naar
een persoon. In kaai ha-loi ‘een hond jaagt het weg’ verandert de betekenis, en wordt
ha- verstaan als datgene dat verjaagd wordt. Vervoegingen als deze komen zeer vaak
voor, en worden op een productieve wijze toegepast.
         Hoofdstuk 6 behandelt het werkwoordelijke gezegde. Ten eerste wordt
uitgelegd hoe Abui werkwoorden hun stam vervoegen om het werkwoord aspect weer
te geven. De vervoeging van de stam geeft aan of de gebeurtenis begint (inceptive),
voltooid is (completive) of voortgezet wordt (continuative). Bijvoorbeeld het werkwoord
‘rennen’ heeft twee stammen firei en firai. De stam firei wordt gebruikt om aan te
geven dat het rennen begint of pas begonnen is (inceptive), terwijl firai aangeeft dat het
rennen inmiddels volbracht is (completive). Er zijn een aantal werkwoordklassen die hun
stammen op deze wijze variëren. Het werkwoord kan vervolgens maximaal drie aspect–
achtervoegsels krijgen. Deze geven aan of de gebeurtenis begonnen of volbracht is, of
nog doorgaat. Hierboven zagen we al dat een werkwoord combineert met een of twee
voorvoegsels die het U argument uitdrukken. Abui werkwoorden zijn flexibel, hetzelfde
werkwoord kan in een transitieve constructie gebruikt worden (met twee participanten)
maar ook in een intransitieve constructie (met slechts één participant). Ditransitieve
constructies zoals ‘ik gaf Jan een boek’ komen in Abui niet voor. Deze constructies
worden met een seriële constructie uitgedrukt zoals na sura mi Yance he-ri ‘ik nam een
boek en gaf (het) aan Jantje’.
         Het werkwoordelijke gezegde is de kern van de zin. Het kan combineren met
andere zinsdelen. Naamwoordsgroepen (NPs), voornaamwoorden, bijwoorden,
aanwijzende voornaamwooden (deictic demonstratives) staan links van het gezegde.
Ontkennende en bevestigende partikels, en anaforische voornaamwoorden (anaphoric
demonstratives) volgen het werkwoordelijke gezegde.
         Hoofdstuk 7 is in zijn geheel gewijd aan complexe werkwoorden. Abui beschikt
over een gesloten klasse van generieke werkwoorden (generic verbs). Generieke
werkwoorden hebben een zeer algemene betekenis die vaak pas in het zinsverband
duidelijk wordt. Het zijn werkwoordsvormen die uit een enkele medeklinker of klinker
bestaan, zoals d ‘houden, grijpen, verkrijgen, pakken’. Met behulp van generieke
werkwoorden worden complexe werkwoorden afgeleid van zowel werkwoordelijke
stammen als andere stammen. Bijvoorbeeld van de naamwoordsstam namu ‘wond’ kan
met het generieke werkwoord l ‘geven’ het complexe werkwoord namu-l ‘verwonden’
worden afgeleid. Waneer de voltooide (completive) stam r van hetzelfde generieke
werkwoord ‘geven’ wordt gebruikt dan wordt de betekenis van namu-r ‘gewond raken’.
         Hoofdstuk 8 behandelt seriële werkwoorden. Seriële werkwoorden zijn clusters
van werkwoorden die zich als één groep gedragen: ze vallen onder één ontkenning, één
intonatiepatroon en delen minimaal één argument. Dezelfde gebeurtenis die in het
Nederlands met een enkel werkwoord beschreven kan worden, beschrijft men in Abui
meestal met meerdere werkwoorden. Bijvoorbeeld ‘terugbrengen’ wordt in het Abui
540                          SAMENVATTING IN HET NEDERLANDS
uitgedrukt met de werkwoorden wai ‘draaien’, mi ‘nemen’, en me ‘komen’. Op deze
wijze worden gebeurtenissen feitelijk opgedeeld in deel-gebeurtenissen. Ik verdeel de
seriële werkwoorden in twee groepen: symmetrische en asymmetrische seriële
werkwoorden. Symmetrische seriële werkwoorden bestaan uit werkwoorden die geen
afhankelijkheid van elkaar vertonen zoals pi yaa mit natet tanga ananra ‘we
onderhandelen’ letterlijk ‘we gaan, zitten, staan op spreken en vertellen’ en dat allemaal
onder één intonatiepatroon, in één adem. Asymmetrische seriële werwoorden vertonen
een afhankelijkheid ten opzichte van elkaar. Een van de werkwoorden gedraagt zich als
het hoofd van de cluster. Het andere werkwoord heeft een hulpfunctie. Bijvoorbeeld in
na sieng nee kanri ‘ik heb de rijst opgegeten, let. ik at rijst voltooide’, drukt het
werkwoord kanri ‘voltooien’ het aspect uit van het eten. In na me na-riki ‘ik werd ziek’
is de functie van me ‘komen’ om aan te geven dat het ziek worden op een geleidelijke
wijze gebeurt.
        Het boek wordt afgesloten met een aantal teksten en een woordenlijst.

                         1976. From 1995 to 1998 he studied Czech and Dutch language and literature at the
                         Charles University of Prague. In 1998, he continued his study at the Catholic University
                         of Nijmegen, the Netherlands. He studied Dutch language and literature and
                         Indonesian. In 2002 he received his doctoraal (MA) degree, after which he moved to
                         Leiden to enroll as a PhD student at the Leiden University Centre for Linguistics
                         (LUCL). As of June 2007 he will take up a postdoc fellowship at the Research Center
                         for Linguistic Typology of the La Trobe University, Melbourne.","[551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564]"

enumeration; this is illustrated in section 4.4.4.1, example (88). In (45), the nouns iya
‘trunk’, foi ‘peel, soft trunk’, upi ‘fruit’, and bika ‘kernel’ refer to parts of plants. The
species of the plant is specified by the left constituent of the compound:(45)   wata        iya                      baleei     foi                 bataa       bika

       ‘mango fruit’                        ‘coconut’The nouns upi ‘fruit’ and bika ‘kernel’ also occur as adnominal modifiers in the
enumeration of small round shaped objects, for more details see section 4.4.4.1,
examples (89) and (87). In (46), a number of compounds headed by the noun tuku
‘piece’ are given; the left constituent specifies the material of the piece.(46)   bataa tuku                               tipai        tuku
       wood piece                               iron       piece

       ‘piece of liana sp.’                     ‘piece of firewood’In (47), the compounds contain the head buk ‘bunch’, referring to parts of vegetal
bodies; the left constituent specifies the species:(47)   kanai       buk            fiyai         buk                  mea      buk

       ‘canari nut bunch’         ‘candlenut bunch’                  ‘mango bunch’The objects that are held together by a rope are described with the noun tel ‘bundle’. In
(48), the noun tel ‘bunch’ is the head of a number of compounds that are formed in the
same way as the previous two types.

       ‘firewood bundle’            ‘betel vine bundle’             ‘vegetable bundle’In (49), the head constituent expresses a habitat of various animal species; the left
constituent specifies the species. One may wonder whether the compounds ruwol ata
‘chicken nest’ and mutang kadielang ‘bee hive’ given in the fist row may be considered
endocentric. As for the compound ruwol ata ‘chicken nest’, in Alor, chicken usually
nest in mango trees standing in the vicinity of a house. The head ata ‘leaf’ can be taken
quite literally as the nest location of a chicken. As for the compound mutang kadielang
‘bee stipel’, bee hives are usually found high in the trees, attached under a branch. In
that sense, they resemble the stipel of a plant.(49)   ruwol         ata                 mutang         kadielang           birel     patei

       ‘red ant nest (under ground)’     ‘rat nest’In (50), two compounds headed by the nouns dieng ‘pot’ are given. The left constituent
of each compound refers to the material from which a specific ‘pot’ is made.(50)   anei     dieng                                      tipai dieng
       soil      pot                                       iron pot
       ‘crock, clay pot’                                   ‘iron pot’In (51), two types of houses are given. The right constituent is the head of the structure
because it denotes the category referred to by the compound. In the compound bile
tofa ‘field shelter’, the left constituent bile ‘sprout’ specifies the purpose for which the
house (in this case a shelter) is made. In the compound aremang fala ‘tribal house’, the
left constituent aremang ‘tribe’ refers to the ‘tribe’ as an owner of the house.(51)   bile          tofa                                  aremang fala
       sprout       shelter                                tribe        house
       ‘field shelter to watch over growing crops’         ‘tribal house’Animal species may be distinguished by compounds of the type given in (52). The left
constituent specifies the location, in which a species typically occurs. The species is
expressed by the head constituent.(52)   tei      fe                                         baleei   pakak
       field     pig                                       banana spider
       ‘wild pig’                                          ‘spider sp.’
152                                          CHAPTER IV
Some compounds seem to be calque constructions from Malay. The compound anei
takoi, given in (53), is a literal calque from Malay kacang tanah ‘peanut, lit.: bean soil’.
Note that the order of constituents is reversed to match Abui compound structure.(53)    anei takoi
        soil bean
        ‘peanut’
4.3.2     Exocentric compounds
Compounds that refer to an entity which is not expressed by one of the constituents
are called EXOCENTRIC (cf. Booij 2005:79). Exocentric compounds are right-headed just
as endocentric compounds. A few are listed in (54); they are headed by the noun tuku
‘piece’. The compounds refer to people that are characterized by the property expressed
by the first constituent. The first constituent is in all cases a verb.(54)    mielang tuku                         bui   tuku                    palet         tuku

        ‘coward’                             ‘shortie’                     ‘gawk, clumsy’
4.3.3     List compounds
List compounds are non-headed structures; none of the constituents can be pointed out
as the head of the compound. They consist of two nouns that list the referred entities.
These structures are not conjunctions because the order of constituent nouns is fixed.(55)    wil         kalieta                                he-ya             he-maama

        ‘grandparent and child’                            ‘his parents’

        ‘all what is needed for a funeral’                 ‘his helper, assistant’
4.3.4     Nominalized Verb Phrases
In Abui, there are verb phrases that are used non-predicatively. These verb phrases are
nominalised and possibly lexicalized; they combine with adnominal modifiers (mainly
anaphoric demonstratives) and serve to express arguments. As discussed in section
3.2.2, many lexical items in Abui are categorically indetermined and can be used
predicatively and referentially. The ambiguity is usually resolved by the syntactic context
in which the item is inserted. The presence of a quantifier or anaphoric demonstrative

typically indicates a nominal structure. However, also a number of verb phrases are
nominalised and used referentially, as illustrated in (56). They indicate spatial or
temporal locations that are specified by the first constituent. The final constituent of
these forms is always a verb. The first constituent is either a noun, expressing an
argument of the head verb, or another verb.(56)   war sei                                          war marang

       3II.INAL-tooth be.in-DUR
       ‘two main beams of the house supported by vertical poles with mouth-like endings’In (57), a number of species are grouped according to their typical habitat. The habitat
(a ‘location’) that expressed with an NP is the U argument of the verb ì ‘put’; it is
referred to by the prefix he- (3II.LOC). Observe that the first constituent is a noun (tei
‘field’, mang ‘possession’, or an NP (ahiling tama ‘air’), or another nominalised VP
(tama wal ‘ocean’).(57)   tei       he-ì                                   mang         he-ì

       ‘air animals, flying animals’                    ‘sea animals’In (58), various utensils are referred to by their typical ‘location’. The constituent
expressing the ‘location’ (usually a noun, and in case of ara pe ‘kitchen, cooking place’
another nominalised VP) is the U argument of the verb ì ‘put’.(58)   aremang          he-ì                            gereja he-ì

154                                      CHAPTER IV
In (59), the nominalised VPs with the verb ì ‘put’ refer to the right-hand and left-hand
side.(59)   kang     he-ì                                     bikil he-ì

       ‘right-hand side’                                 ‘left-hand side’The nominalized VPs given in (56)-(59) contain in most cases verbs that refer to
locations such as mi ‘be in’, ì ‘put’, hanai/hanah-a ‘put between’, tai/tah-a ‘put on’, or
pe ‘be near’. In fact, these structures possibly originate as headless relative clauses of the
type illustrated in (60).(60)   nala ba         {ara pe}RC        >     {ara pe}RC ba             >       [ara pe]N

       ‘something that is nearby fire’         ‘that is nearby fire’             ‘kitchen’The nominalised VPs given in (61) refer to containers or instruments. The verb
indicates the typical purpose of the tool. The left constituent is a noun that expresses
the undergoer argument of the verb and the entity, to which the tool is applied. In
Takalelang dialect the word for water is ya; however, in Aila dialect the form is ye.(61)   ye=k                                              fu            lák

       ‘bucket, bamboo container for fetching water’     ‘betel nut container’In (62), the nominalized VPs refer to large bodies of water. The VP is headed by the
verb wal ‘augment, add’ that combines with a single argument.(62)   tama     wal                                      ya      wal
       sea     augment                                   water augment
       ‘ocean’                                           ‘pond’In (63), the nominalised VP da-wa bang (lit.: ‘carry his mouth’) refers to a person that
likes to gossip. This referent is cross-referenced with the possessive prefix da- (3I.INAL)
as possessor of the noun wa ‘mouth’ that serves as the U argument of the verb bang
‘carry’.(63)   da-wa              bang
       3I.INAL-mouth     carry
       ‘gossip, scandalmonger’Nominalised VPs such as dawa bang (lit.: ‘carry his mouth’) probably originate in
relative clauses. In (64), a complex NP is used to refer to a ‘tailor’. The noun ama
‘person’ is the head of the NP and combines with a relative clause given in the brackets.
It is followed by the noun adua ‘master, boss’ in a possessive-like construction.

quantifier loku (PL). As discussed in section 4.4.4.2, the quantifier loku (PL) is an
adnominal modifier that follows the head noun. The quantifier loku (PL) indicates that
the referent is individuated (mostly human) and occurs in plural number. Any stem that
is followed by the quantifier loku (PL) is interpreted non-predicatively and serves as the
head of an NP. This is illustrated in (65) where a number of verbal stems combine with
loku (PL).(65)   pe     loku                                  fing loku
       near PL                                      eldest PL

       ‘new people, i.e. Malay people’              ‘the runners, those who run’The constructions with loku (PL) possibly originate in relative clauses. There are
complex NPs containing a relative clause; the head of the NP is sometimes omitted (∅)
and only the relative clause and the linker ba are left over. The next step is to delete the
linker and one arrives at forms listed above.(66)   ama      ba      {firai}RC loku >   ∅ {firai}     loku ba          >   firai loku

its function. As illustrated in 4.5, the linker usually follows the head NP. However, if
the constituent order is reversed, it follows the relative clause and the NP is the final
constituent.","[172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178]"
"   8.3.1.3    SVC with re ‘reach’
SVC with the minor verb re ‘reach’ encodes the initial point of an event. The inceptive
stem of the verb re ‘reach’ alternates sometimes with the continuative stem ra ‘reach,
attempt’. The stem re/ra ‘reach’ displays except stem alternation also other verbal
properties, such as aspectual and person inflection.9 Abui speakers often translate re/ra
with the Malay verb coba ‘try, attempt’. An example is given in (34) where the major
verb tulok ‘stab’ is serialized with the minor verb re ‘reach’:(34)    me        ne-l              tulok      re
        come 1SG.LOC-give         stab         reach.ICP
        ‘if you dare, come and stab me’                                                   [B10.020.09]In the following case re is serialized with minang ‘remember’ that combines with two
U arguments. The prefix a- (2SG.PAT) refers to the experiencer of ‘remembering’. The
LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC) refers to the remembered matter. Both verbs share their
aspectual inflection; the perfective suffix -i (PFV) appears on the final minor verb only.
The aspectual inflection of the form re proves its verbhood.(35)    he-a-minang                    re-i!
        3II.LOC-2SG.PAT-remember reach.ICP-PFV

with re. Both major verbs in (36) marei ‘go up’ and rimaldi ‘turn’ combine with the
inceptive aspectual marker se (INCP.I). This marker is the only aspectual inflection that
may intervene between the major and minor verb. The inceptive marker se (INCP.I) and
the minor verb re ‘reach’ have similar functions. Both forms refer to the initial point of
9It is unclear whether the form re ‘or’ is related to this verbal form. The verb ra/re ‘try, attempt’ may
originate as complex verb in generic roots r ‘reach’ and a ‘be at’, e ‘add’.

inceptive marker te (INCP.C); the minor verb re ‘reach’ combines with the perfective
suffix -i (PFV) that is shared by both verbs:(37)   kawen       ba      [topa      nu]RC      ong      bul-r-i=te                 re-i!

       ‘sharpen now finally that blunt machete!’                  [B05.040.09]The minor verb re ‘reach’ sometimes combines with sai ‘put along’ to refer to events,
that might possibly happen, or happen randomly anywhere. This is illustrated in (38). In
(a), the major verb kafering ‘horrify’ combines with re and sai expressing that the
second person participant might ‘become evil’. In the first clause, the second person
singular participant is realized as the U argument of the verb do ‘hold’ with the LOC
prefix e- (2SG.LOC). For more information about the attributive serial construction with
the verb d-o ‘hold’, see section 8.4.2.2. In (b), both verbs combine with the verb nee-i
‘eat’. In both cases the clause contains either the location question word te ‘where’ or a
temporal adverb. Some more examples can be found in 8.3.3.2.(38)   a. e-d-o                       beka,      ko       o-kafering          re            sai

inflection (see 8.1.1), this is not always the case. In aspectual ASVC.I, the major verb may
be inflected for aspect too, typically with the inceptive markers se/te (INCP). The
aspectual properties of the inceptive markers are similar to the aspect contributed by
the verb re ‘reach’.
        The verb re ‘reach’ often occurs in imperative constructions. Two instances are
given in (39). Note that in (b) the verb re ‘reach’ follows the negator naha (NEG) which
indicates that two verbs are not serialized here. As marked with the brackets, the verb
re ‘reach’ is here the main verb while the preceding clause serves as its complement.

The verb tik ‘stretch’ occurs as the minor verb in an ASVC.I to indicate a postponed
final point of the event. This is illustrated in (40), where the major verb wel ‘pour’ is
serialized with the minor verb tik ‘stretch’ in (a). In (b), the major verb wel ‘pour’
combines with two minor verbs: tik ‘stretch’ and loida ‘lengthen’. In both cases, the
minor verbs combine with the prefix ha- (3II.PAT) that refers to the first part of the
serial verb construction that functions as a complement of the minor verb.(40)       a. [Simon         di da-wel]complement        la=ng           ha-tik

‘on and on’, where in both cases a boundary is either ignored or suspended. In (a), the
deictic verb la ‘be.MD’ expresses the location of the event. It is discussed separately in
section 8.4.4.3. SVCs with the generic verb ng are described in 8.4.2.1.","[383, 384, 385]"
"SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS. The second type of multiple-verb constructions are serial
verb constructions (SVCs). Two serial verb constructions are given in (17).

portion of Abui SVCs consists of more than two verbs as in (b). Different meaning
components of the verbs conjoined in a SVC can be activated. This is illustrated by the
verb me ‘come’ in (18) that has two grammatical functions here. In (a) me ‘come’
encodes direction towards the deictic centre (DC), while in (b) it describes the ‘gradual’
manner of somebody becoming ill.(18)   a. di tur-i                ya    mi    me            b. di me     ha-rik-i

            ‘she scooped up and brought it (towards DC)       ‘he got gradually ill’I distinguish between two types of SVCs according to their compositional properties:
symmetrical and asymmetrical SVCs. SVCs in which the verbs have ‘equal’ grammatical
status and are not restricted to a limited set are symmetrical. The verbs in symmetrical
SVCs encode the reported event in a step by step fashion by listing the verbs as in (19):(19)   fe     mi     me     feng!
       pig take come injure
       ‘slaughter the pig here!’                                               [B10.014.08]        Asymmetrical SVCs consist of a ‘minor verb’ from a restricted set and a ‘major
verb’ from an unrestricted set. Minor verbs are grammaticalized to express different
grammatical functions. Major verbs express the event, functioning as the semantic
‘head’ of an asymmetrical SVC. As illustrated in (18), the minor verb me ‘come’ may
precede or follow the major verb. When the minor verb follows the major verb, its
grammatical functions relate to the right edge of the clause. These functions include
aspect, direction, manner and mood. In (20), the verb me ‘come’ is serialized with the
verb pe ‘be near’ that indicates the aspect.(20)   nu-tafuda          he-n               me    pe

These functions relate to the left edge of the clause such as complements, event
location, participant oriented manner and mood which is illustrated in (21), where the
verb l ‘give’ introduces the malefactive of ‘injuring’ or ‘murdering’ expressed by the
verb feng ‘injure’.

           1.8     Fieldwork and language informants
The data for this grammar was collected during fieldwork in Alor between 2003 and
2005. In 2003, I stayed in the field for seven months. The first two weeks I spent in
Kalabahi. Initially, I worked on the Fanating dialect. After two weeks I moved to the
village of Takalelang where I stayed with the family of Mr. Timoteus Lanma. Takalelang
became my main fieldwork site from which I made several trips to Tifol Afeng, a
nearby hamlet in the surrounding mountains. In 2004, I spent five months in Alor,
mainly in Takalelang. I made a few trips to Tifol Afeng and also spent almost a week in
Mainang. During the year I participated in the teaching program of the Artha Wacana
University branch in Kalabahi and had an opportunity to work with Abui speakers
from Mataru. In July 2004, I co-organized a workshop on the orthography of local
languages. Participants were teachers and language consultants. 8 In 2005, I spent in
total two months in Takalelang and Tifolafeng.
        In Table 5, I list Abui speakers with whom I worked. Whenever possible, I give
their ages and the languages they speak. In the right-hand column the name of the
village/dialect is given. Note that I make a distinction between Malay and Indonesian;
Alor Malay is a distinct variety of Malay, quite different from standard Indonesian
(Baird et.al. 2006). Older people that I worked with often only spoke Malay, not
Indonesian.","[41, 42, 43]"
"       4.4     Noun Phrases
A noun phrase (NP) is a syntactic constituent headed by a noun. It expresses the
argument of a verb. In Abui, the head noun of an NP combines with a number of
adnominal modifiers such as modifier nouns, adjectives, stative verbs, demonstratives,
156                                         CHAPTER IV
and quantifiers. Modifier nouns (NMOD) specify some property of the referred entity
such as shape, size, age, or gender. Adjectives and stative verbs (ADJ/V) specify some
property of head nouns such as colour, quality, size, taste etcetera. Demonstratives
(DEM) are modifiers expressing something about the identifiability and referentiality of
an NP in space or discourse. Demonstratives that locate the referent in space are
referred to as deictic demonstratives (DEICT); demonstratives that locate the referent in
discourse are anaphoric demonstratives (DEM). As discussed in section 3.5.2, both
subtypes of demonstratives are differentiated by their syntactic position in an NP. The
deictic demonstratives precede the head noun while the anaphoric demonstratives
follow it. Quantifiers (QUANT) express something about the quantity of referents
realized as a noun phrase. As discussed in section 3.5.3, there are two subtypes of
quantifiers: the numerals and non-numeral quantifiers. Quantifiers always follow the
head noun. In Abui, there are complex NPs that contain more than one adnominal
modifier. In such complex NPs, the adnominal modifiers combine in fixed order
schematically illustrated in (67). Of all adnominal modifiers, only deictic demonstratives
(DEICT) and possessors (NPOSS) may precede the head noun, which may carry possessive
inflection (PROPOSS) discussed in section 4.2. The nouns, adjectives, stative verbs,
numeral and non-numeral quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives must follow the
head noun.6(67)    NP Æ        (DEICT) (NPOSS PROPOSS-) N (NMOD) (ADJ/V) (QUANT) (DEM)In the following sections, I will give an overview of each adnominal modifier type. In
section 4.4.1, I describe the modifier nouns that combine with the head noun. In
section 4.4.2, I give an overview of the verbs and adjectives. The demonstratives are
discussed in section 4.4.3. In 4.4.4, I describe the quantifiers. The combinations of
adnominal modifiers in complex NPs are described in section 4.4.5. In section 4.5, I
discuss related complex structures characterized by the intersective linker ba (LNK). In
these structures, a complex modifier (an NP or a clause) is linked by the intersective
linker ba (LNK) to a head noun.","[178, 179]"

  8.3.5.2    SVC with wa / wi ‘be like.MD’
The minor verb wa/wi ‘be like.MD’ refer to the way or manner in which the event was
performed. This type of manner may be considered as ‘medial’, it is obvious to both
speech participants; however, this type is often used in questions, because the speaker
wants to indicate lower awareness of the manner in which an event was performed. The13 This strategy is in fact a form of tail head linkage (THL), a typical feature of for many Papuan languages (cf.de Vries, 2005). In Abui usually last clause is recapitulated in THL constructions. The final verb of
recapitulated clause combines with an complex index verb.

referred manner is expressed by the complement that precedes the index verb. In (75)
the major verb ayong ‘swim’ is serialized with the complex verb wi-d-a ‘become like
that’ that serves as minor verb. The first complement is a clause, while the second
complement is a part of serial verb construction.(75)   [di ayong do,]CC [afu he-n-u                            ayong]complement

       ‘he swims like a fish’, lit.: ‘given he swims, he does (so) like a fish swims’     [B07.053.02]Both verbs share the A argument of the verb ayong ‘swim’ realized with the NP afu
‘fish’. The verb ayong ‘swim’ occurs also in the first clause and combines with a
different A argument expressed as the free pronoun di (3A). Logically the verb wida has
to share the argument expressed as the NP afu ‘fish’ with the second verb. It is not
clear whether the verb wi-d-a ‘become like that’ has a second argument. It seems to be
linked in a paratactic topic-comment structure with the first clause di ayong do ‘he
swims’.
         In (76) a fragment of the Lord’s prayer is given. The verb wi-d-a ‘become like
that’ is serialized with the verb mi-a ‘be in’ to express the manner in which the earth
should be. The bracketed structure melang san mi-a ‘be in heaven’ serves as a
complement of the verb wi-d-a ‘become like that’. The second argument of the verb
wi-d-a ‘become like that’ is expressed with the complement clause buku taha mi-a do
‘be on earth’. Observe also that the VP structure o-mi ‘inside you’ is nominalized in a
possessive construction (see also 8.4.2.3).(76)   [o-mi]nominal he-san           he-masolang mi ni-l,                     [buku tah-a

verb ma ‘be.PRX’ combines with the REC prefix that expresses the speaker as
experiencer of the disapproval.(77)   no-ma                  wa                    naha

  8.3.5.3     SVC with ha ‘be like.DST’
In SVCs, the index verb ha ‘be like.DST’ refers to a manner of way of performing an
event that is new to the addressee and can be considered as ‘distal’. An example
contrasting with (75) is given in (78) below. The minor verb hari ‘make somehow’ is
complex. It combines with the major verb ayon ‘swim’. Both verbs share the aspectual
inflection that is expressed on the minor verb.(78)   di      [afu he-n-u                 ayon]complement ha-r-i

not being part of a complex verb. However, in indicative constructions derived forms
tend to be used. Consider now example (79) where the minor verbs ha ‘be like.DST’ and
hal ‘make somehow’ occur serialized with the major verb reng ‘turn to’. In (a) ha is
used in imperative construction; in indicative construction hal ‘make somehow’ must
be used instead. In both cases the serialized verbs share the A argument: a (2SG) in (a),
di (3A) in (b). The U argument of the minor verbs ha and hal is the NP oto ‘car’. The
phrase war sei ‘sun descends, west’ together with the bound pronoun ha- (3II.PAT) is
the U argument of the major verb reng ‘turn to’.(79)   a. a      oto   mi ba war sei             ha-reng             ha!

8.4         Asymmetrical Serial Verb Constructions type II
Asymmetrical SVCs of type II are composed of a grammatically restricted verb (the
‘minor’ verb) followed by an open-class verb (the ‘major’ verb, see also 8.1.2). The
major verb identifies the event and the minor verb has a grammatical function relating
to argument realization and describing event settings. The ordering of the minor and
major verb is parallel to Abui clause structure. In a clause, adverbial modifiers and
arguments precede the VP. On semantic grounds, the major verb can be considered as
the head of the serial construction. Syntactically, the notion of head is problematic, as
the valence of the major verb does not necessarily correspond to the valence of the
whole structure (cf. Aikhenvald, 2006:29).
        In this section, asymmetrical SVCs of type II are discusses according to the

SVCs in which the minor verb belongs to the generic-verb class. The quantification
SVCs are discussed in 8.4.3. In section 8.4.4, I give an overview of SVCs with minor
verbs belonging to the deictic-verb class. SVCs with minor verbs from the positional-
verb class are discussed in section 8.4.5. These SVCs express the position of the
participants involved in the event. The second type of manner SVCs is described
section 8.4.6, it expresses participant oriented manner and differs from the manner
SVC described in 8.3.3 which is event oriented. In section 8.4.7, I discuss the second
type of modal SVCs, which expresses participant oriented modality and differs from the
modal SVC discussed in 8.3.4 which expresses event oriented modality.","[395, 396, 397, 398]"
"3.5.5    Adverbs
Adverbs are identified as forms that do not occur as adnominal modifiers and do not
occur as single predicates. Abui has the following adverbs: yal ‘now’, ko ‘soon’, ka
‘following’, kal ‘another time, next time’, e/el ‘before’, wan ‘already’, wala ‘so’, yang
‘perhaps’, sawai ‘in vain’, taka ‘only’, and bai ‘as well’. They are part of the verb phrase
and express either aspect or manner. The aspectual adverbs yal, ko, ka, kal, e/el, and
wan always precede the predicate in a clause (see 6.3). Adverbs sawai ‘in vain’ and taka
‘only’ often follow deictic verbs. They might be of verbal origin. The adverb dara ‘still’
originates in serial verb construction and is a lexicalized form of the verb ra ‘reach,
attempt, persist’ (see also 8.4.7.3). Examples below include adverbs wan ‘already’, e/el

‘before, and yal ‘now’. In (165), the adverb wan occurs between the verb firei ‘run’ and
the A argument expressed as the free pronoun na (1SG):(165) na wan            firei      no-kan-d-i
      1SG already run.ICP          1SG.REC-be.good.CPL-hold-PFV

argument na (1SG) and precedes the U argument kopi ‘coffee’.(166) na el           kopi     buut-i
      1sg before coffee consume.CPL-PFV
      ‘I had my coffee before’                                              [B01.036.35]In (167), the adverb yal ‘now’ occurs between the NP moku fila ‘small kid’ and the free
pronoun di (3A) that co-indexes the NP as the A argument.(167) moku fila             yal   di tadei     da-yongfi

‘tomorrow’, ‘fortunately’ or ‘in vain’ are expressed by separate predicates. For more
details, see sections 6.3.3.7, 6.3.3.6, 8.3.3, and 8.3.4. Adverbs play an important
diagnostic role in identification of serial verbs constructions and complex verbs. Both
serial verb constructions and complex verbs are contiguous in the sense that no adverb
may occur between the conjoined morphemes.","[147, 148]"

3.2.4    Relation between semantic and distributional properties of nouns
In Abui, semantic properties of nouns, such as animacy or individuation, are in relation
to their distributional properties. In general, actors are animate. They are realized with
NPs and co-indexed with the free pronoun di (3A). This is illustrated in (19) where the
NP naana ‘older sibling’ combines with di.(19)    naana        di na-wel
        older.sibling 3A 1SG.PAT-pour
        ‘my older sibling bathes me’                                                  [B01.032.08]Inanimate referents may be identified as a force and realized as the A argument of a
verb. As illustrated in (20), the force timoi foka ‘big wind’ is co-indexed with the
pronoun di (3A) as the A argument of the verb -lák ‘break’. Note that the free pronoun
di (3A) combines exclusively with A arguments.(20)    timoi foka        di lik          fala        ha-lák
        wind      be.big 3A platform house 3II.PAT-break
        ‘the big wind broke the house and verandah’                                   [B06.011.02]Both animate and inanimate participants may be identified as undergoers. In general,
animate and human undergoer participants are realized in more complex constructions
than inanimate undergoer participants. This is illustrated in (21) where the verb bol ‘hit’
combines in (a) with an inanimate undergoer realized as the NP wó kanai do ‘the canari
                                     GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                            75
nuts up there’. In (b), the verb bol ‘hit’ combines with a human undergoer Arjun. This
participant is identified as a benefactive and expressed as the U argument of the verb l
‘give’ and co-indexed with the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC). The verb l ‘give’ is
grammaticalized to encode benefactive participants.(21)    a. he-kuta                   wó        kanai           do          bol
             3II.AL-grandparent DIST.H canari.nut            PRX         hit
             ‘his grandfather hits the canari nuts up there’
        b. Mai Fan Arjun               he-l            bol
             name        name          3II.LOC-give    hit
             ‘Mai Fan hits Arjun’Another semantic property of nouns is individuation. It has been suggested in the
literature (cf. Gentner and Boroditsky 2001) that nouns differ in their ontological status
ranging from prototypical objects such as ‘man’ to prototypical substances such as
‘water’. This scale is referred to as ‘Individuation Continuum’ (cf. Gentner and
Boroditsky 2001:230). Prototypical objects in languages such as ‘man’ or ‘father’ are
individuated. Prototypical substances such as ‘water’ or ‘wood’ are not individuated. In
Abui, the feature [±individuated] is manifested in the asymmetrical use of the quantifier
loku (PL). 3 The quantifier indicates a plural number of individuated referents. It is
ungrammatical to use the quantifier loku with typical mass nouns such as bataa ‘wood’.
This is illustrated in (22).(22)    a. bataa                                       b. *bataa loku
             wood                                            wood        PL
             ‘wood, forest, trees’The quantifier loku may not be used with nouns referring to small animals, typically
occurring in large groups such as fikai ‘ant sp.’; this identifies them as mass nouns.(23)    a. fe     loku               b. mutang         loku         c.     *fikai   loku
             pig PL                       bee          PL                  ant      PL
             ‘pigs’                       ‘bees’Mass nouns can be individuated when they combine with a numeral. Numerals
contribute the feature [+individuated] and can make nouns such as bataa ‘wood, forest,
trees’ countable. Another related strategy is the use of a modifier noun such as tuku
‘piece’. The semantics of the noun tuku ‘piece’ describes the shape of the substance
and helps to conceptualize it as a [+individuated] object. This is illustrated in (24).","[97, 98]"
