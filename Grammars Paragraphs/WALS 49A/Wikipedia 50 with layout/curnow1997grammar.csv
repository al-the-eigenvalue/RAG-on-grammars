4.3.3     Personal pro11ouns
The non-interrogative personal pronouns, which necessarily refer to hun1ans only,
are differentiated for three persons and two numbers. There are also two inter-
rogative / negative personal pronouns and two indefinite pronouns ; these have no
nu1nber distinctions. 2 (See Table 4.3 for the forms.) The existence of special
plural forms for the non-interrogative and non-indefinite pronouns is one of the
factors which distinguish personal pronouns from other non1inals, which have no
number marking.
        While other referential human N Ps use the postposi tion ta to indicate that
they are in Object relation (see section 5.4.2), the personal pronouns have special
  2
   The indefinites are clearly based on the interrogative/ negative pronouns , plus a following
waza, which does not appear to occur elsewhere in the language.

Accusative forms. For the singular personal pronouns there are special Accusative
suffixes, wa for first and second person, a for third person and the interrogative
person pronoun. As these forms are obligatorily attached to the personal pro-
nouns, and no material n1ay intervene between the pronoun and the Accusative
n1arker, they are considered suffixes rather than clitics. Another possibility would
be to consider the con1bination of pronoun and Accusative marker as a su ppleti ve
forn1, but the repetition of the same forms for n1ore than one personal pronoun
( wa for two pronouns, a for two pronouns), and the fact that the fonn of the
Nominative personal pronouns occurs in the Accusative form, suggest that an
analysis of these forms as Accusative suffixes is more appropriate.
        The plural personal pronouns have special Accusative clitics, which attach
to the final elen1ent of an Object NP containing a plural personal pronoun, not
necessarily directly to the personal pronouns themselves. Normally the only
elen1ent in an NP containing a personal pronoun is the personal pronoun itself,
as no n1odifiers except numerals are permitted in such an NP. However, when
nun1erals do cooccur with (plural) personal pronouns, they follow the pronoun
( as in (83)), whereas numerals precede nouns ( as in (82)). Thus if a personal
pronoun with a numeral is used in Object relation, the Accusative clitic occurs
on the numeral rather than the pronoun itself ( as can be seen in (84)).(82)    kutnya ampu

    other referential human non1inals form a possessive using the postposition pa (see
    section 5.4.8). The human interrogative/ negative pronoun min ' who ' forn1s a pos-
    sessive in this usual fashion; however the non-interrogative personal pronouns do
    not have possessive forms in this sense, but rather uses the su ppleti ve possessive
    adjectives for the singular pronouns, and either the singular possessive adjective
    or the bare plural personal pronoun itself for the plural case (see section 4.4.5).
            More information on the non-interrogative personal pronouns is found in
    section 5.2; the interrogative/ negative personal pronouns are discussed in sec-

       5.4      Postpositio11al pl1rases
       Postpositional phrases are formed in Awa Pit using a variety of postpositions (for
       a full list, see Table 4.10). Postpositions have an important role in the language,
       as they are often used to mark the relations which particular NPs bear to the
       predicate. In addition to PPs being used as con1plen1ents and adjuncts to verbs,
       however, they may also be used within NPs and other PPs. Postpositions follow an
       NP or another PP, and cli ticize onto the word which precedes them. In addition,
       postpositions n1ay be used following a clause ( see section 10. 2. 3. 2 for details).
                At a theoretical level, the postpositions and postpositional phrases of Awa
       Pit n1ay be divided into a number of types. For example, in n1any theories of
       grammar the Accusative marker would be treated as a case marker, a grammatical
       item with no meaning, while other postpositions would be considered to be true
       adpositions, full and complete words with their own semantic structure. In some
       more recent work, however, this explicit dichotomy has been questioned (see,
       for example, Kumashiro (1994), who discusses the case marker versus adposition
       problem in Japanese).
                It is clear that in Awa Pit there is some difference between the Accusative
       marker, which can show the grammatical relations of Object and Second Object
       and marks a variety of semantic roles, and other postpositions, which do not
       mark gran1matical relations but rather explicitly mark semantic roles. However
       at a formal n1orphosyntactic level all postpositions behave in the san1e fashion,
       with the exception of suppletive forms being used for Object pronouns and pos-
       sessive pronouns, and consequently after a brief discussion of the combination of
       pronouns and postpositions, all postpositions will be treated in the same fashion.

The expected co1nbination of postposition plus pronoun does not always occur in
Awa Pit. S0n1e postpositions - for example, all the locational postpositions -
are not used together with the personal pronouns for obvious se1nantic reasons,
however others are. \Vi th n1ost postpositions, there is no distinction in the use
of the postpositions from their use with nouns: (209)       us=kasa   i-mtu-s

3.5.1     A, S a11d O syntactic functio11s
The basic syntactic functions of A, s and o used in this work are defined according
to Andrews (1985). If an NP argu1nent of a verb with two or more NP arguments
3.5. SYNTACTIC FUf'lCTIONS A1VD GRA1\!Ilv[ATICAL REL.ATIONS                           6:3
 is acting n1orphologically and syntactically identically to the Agent argument of
 a Primary Transitive Verb (such as ' kill '), it is considered to have the syntactic
function A. If it is acting morphologically and syntactically identically to the
 Patient of such a verb, it is said to have the syntactic function o. If an NP
in an intransitive sentence is being accorded the n1orphological and syntactic
treatn1ent normally given to the single argument of a one-argument predicate , it
is considered to have the syntactic function s.
         The son1ewhat more restrictive definitions of A, sand o given by Andrews
(1985) are being adopted, rather than those of Dixon (1994), to avoid some serious
theoretical concerns . Dixon considers that the single argume-n t of any intransitive
verb is an s, and the two arguments of any transitive verb are A and o. However
there are languages which have a very small number of verbs requiring their
arguments to take unusual case marking. For example , in Modern Icelandic
there are a few intransitive verbs which have their single argument case-marked
in the same way as transitive objects are normally marked (Andrews 1985:102).
In Dixon's systen1, we would then be required to consider Modern Icelandic to
be a spli t-s language, as the single argument of an in transitive verb (always an
S following Dixon's definition) can be marked in more than one way; in fact , it
would be a four-way split-s language , as there are also a few verbs which require
their single argument to be in dative or genitive case. Clearly, however, we wish to
consider Icelandic a non1inati ve-accusati ve language , with ·a very few verbs with
unusual case-marking requiren1ents , quite different from a split-s language such
as Dakota, where it is not possible to make a generalization over the entire system
of intransit ive verbs , but rather there are two different systen1s operating. If we
establish definit ions whereby a language such as Icelandic is a split-s language ,
it then becomes necessary to consider further splits such as the 'sp lit-o ' systen1
of Gern1an, where a few transitive verbs (s uch as helpen 'help') have their non-A
argun1ent marked in the dative rather than the accusative, and so on.
         Equally, there are problems with considering A and O to be defined as the
two argurnents of any transitive verb - it is unclear what exactly is a transitive
verb. Dixon (1994:6) simply says that clauses involving ""a verb and two or more
core NPs"" is a transitive clause. If a core NP is defined as A, Soro, we have a
circular definition . If a core NP is not defined this way, it is unclear whether, across
languages , there is an appropriate definition of core NPs. Following Andrews 's
(1985) definition, it ~Nill be suggested that Copula Complen1ents in Awa Pit are
core arguments, and in this case copula clauses contain two core arguments -
but we would not wish to consider these clauses as transitive in many languages ,
including Avl/a Pit. To avoid these problems, Andrews's (1985) more restrictive
definitions of A, s and o will be used here.","[83, 84]"
"3.5.2.2     Case n1arkingThe system of case marking used in Awa Pit is relatively transparent. It is 'ana-
lytic' rather than 'synthetic' (Blake 1994:10), as the relationship between depend-
ent arguments and their verbal heads is expressed through cliticized postpositions
rather than case inflections; however the same information is being offered as is
offered through case inflection, and the use of particles or adpositions to express
the syntactic function of arguments is well known (Dixon 1994:41-42).
        In Awa Pit, the case-marking system is nominative-accusative, with A
and S being 1narked in the same fashion, distinctly from o. N Ps which are in A

     In the following discussion, "" NPs in o function"" will often be referred to. In fact, in the
analysis given here, many of these ""N Ps"" are actually PPs, as the Accusative marker ta is
considered to be a postposition. However the somewhat sloppy wording is used to avoid a
constant use of ""NPs or PPs"".

or s function are unmarked, while NPs in o function are marked as Accusative
if they refer to referential hu1nans, although they re1nain unn1arked if referring
to entities which are not referential and human. 11 The personal pronouns have
special Accusative suffixes or clitics, while all other NPs are 1nade Accusative by
the addition of a clitic postposition ta (see section 5.4.2). The following exan1ples
contain a variety of NPs in A, s and o functions, and clearly show the unn1arked
nature of s and A, and the di vision of o between referential human (Accusative)
and other ( unmarked). 12(38)      Demetria==na    tilawa   a-mtu-y

5.2.4       ""Possessive"" co11structions
While the semantics of the ""dedicated"" modifiers within the NP - such as the
descriptive adjectives and the quantifiers - is relatively straightforward, the
sen1antics of the ""possessive"" construction needs closer examination.
       The ""possessive"" construction can be used to encode a wide range of func-
tions: location-object, whole-part, 1naterial-object, and meanings similar to
English co1nplex prepositions, which are encoded through the use of relational
nouns. Many of these functions have been found cross-linguistically to be coded
similarly to possession,3 and indeed in Awa Pit some of the above functions can
also be marked in the same way as possession, either through the use of the
possessive postposition pa (see 5.4.8), or through the possessive adjectives.
       In some cases, however , there is an alternation between a PP with pa, a
possessive adjective, and a bare noun modifier, where the bare noun acting as a
modifer must occur directly before the noun it 1nodifies. The alternation between
these constructions can be seen to depend on humanness and referentiality. 4 If

    See , for example, Ultan (1978b:28-35).
   4
     ' Referential ' here is not used to imply the logical idea of 'existence in son1e world ', but rather
is used in the sense Giv6n (1982:84) gives it , where a referential noun is one whose "" specific
identity is i1nportant"" rather than ""its generic type membership"" (emphasis in original) . Hopper
& Thompson (1984:711) prefer the label 'manipulable ' to 'referential'.

         the modifying noun is human and referential, the postpositional construction is
         used (or a possessive adjective, if the non-head entity is pronominal); otherwise
         a bare noun modifier is used:          (158)   Santos==pa       pimpul

                  ' (the) person's tongue [most likely]; (the) person's way of speaking
                  [unlikely]'         (162)    awa        pit
                  person language/ tongue
                  'the language of the people (Awa Pit) [n1ost likely] ; human tongues
                  [unlikely]'                 Once this di vision between hurnan, referential entities (expressed through
         the postpositional or possessive adjective constructions) and other entities (ex-
         pressed through a bare noun n1oclifier) has been drawn for those functions where
         the constructions are in alternation, it is possible to see that this distinction un-
         derlies all uses of the constructions, and in fact explains why some functions are
         necessarily expressed by one construction or the other.
                 For example, the ideas of alienable possession and kinship relations neces-
         sarily involve the use of the postpositional or possessive adjective constructions
         ( with the exception of ""plural possessive adjectives"", see below), rather than a
         bare noun modifier. However this follows from the semantics: alienable posses-
         sion and kinship are inherently characteristics of referential humans. In those
         few cases where the idea of possession or relation are expanded to include higher
         animates, Awa Pit personifies the entity in question, treating it like a human:         ( 163)   kwizha== wa pelota
                  dog==POSS ball
                  'the clog's ball'         Equally, in those constructions which encode the relations of location-object ,
         unit-mass, material- object and purpose-object, the first entity is necessarily
         either non-human or non-referential, and consequently the postpositional and
         possessive acljecti ve constructions cannot be used.
124                    1
                    CHAPTER 5. NPS, PPS AND COPULA CO!VIPLE1VIENTS
      The ""plural possessive adjectives"" provide a slightly peculiar exception to
the above regularity. Singular possessive adjectives occur in the expected slot,
and descriptive adjectives may occur between the possessive adjective and the
head noun: (164)   ap katsa til       kuzhu
         my big     black pig
         'my big black pig'However as noted in section 4.4.5 there are no special plural possessive adjective
forms. In order to translate a phrase such as our house, speakers of Awa Pit have
two options. The more common option is to simply use the singular possessive
adjective: (165)   ap yal
         my house
         'my house, our house'The alternative, with no apparent difference of meaning, is to use the plural
Subject pronoun, unchanged, in the bare noun n1odifier slot: (166)   au yal
         we house
         'our house'In this case no adjectives can intervene between the pronoun and the following
noun.
        It could perhaps be 111aintained that the difference between singular and
plural ""possessive adjective"" constructions is related to 'individuation', in the
sense of Hopper & Thompson (1980:253). Pronominal referents which are hu-
man, singular and referential - the more individuated nominals - take one
position , while those which are non-singular occur in a different position. In
this case, however, a distinction would need to be drawn between the way the
language treats 'individuation' in possession with pronouns (where singular and
plural are distinguished by position) and nouns ( where unmarked nouns with
plural reference are treated identically to unmarked nouns with singular refer-
ence). A distinction would also need to be drawn between the treatment of
""possessive adjectives"" (where entities which are singular, human and referential
are distinguished from others) and Accusative 111arking ( where entities which are
hu111an and referential, whether singular or plural, are distinguished from others).
       On the whole it seems more sensible to simply consider that there is a
""gap"" in the language, a lack of plural possessive adjectives, and that the speakers
make up for this gap either by using a singular possessive adjective or a plural
Subject pronoun in the bare noun modifier position, rather than attempt to find
a theoretical explanation.
       In the following sections the various functions of the pa-postposi tional
construction, the possessive adjective construction and the bare noun modifier

structions used to encode all the following functions are identical - the following
are simply a family of related n1eanings that are expressed in the san1e way.","[143, 144, 145, 146]"
"However expected combinations of the Accusative postposition or the possessive
postposition with pronouns do not occur.
        The possessive 1narker pa is not used together with the first, second and
third person personal pronouns (it is used together with the interrogative per-
sonal pronoun min 'w ho'). Rather, there are special possessive adjectives instead
( see 4.4 .5 for details). However, these ~orms are not n1erely suppletive forms ,
but rather a quite separate item, as the possessive adjectives may be used pre-
dicatively, while a postpositional phrase of possession may not be used in this
way: (210)       a.n yal=na           ap ka-y
             this house ==T OP n1y be:permanently-N o NLOC UT

Object , there are special suppletive Accusative pronoun forms, rather than simply
using the Nominative singular pronoun followed by the Accusative postposition.
In the case of plural personal pronouns, the Nominative form is used, together
with a special Accusative clitic, distinct from the Accusative postposition. For
further details and a full listing of these Accusative pronominal fonns, see sec-
tion 4.3.3.",[155]
"
4.6         Postpositio11s
Postpositions play a very important role in Awa Pit. As a language without a
case-suffix system (except for the pronouns), Awa Pit relies very strongly on its
postpositions to indicate the relations which noun phrases may play in a sentence.
Many postpositions are also used following non-finite clauses, essentially creating
constructions similar to English subordinating conj unctions.
       The Awa Pit postpositions are listed in Table 4.10, together with an ap-
                                                                              11
proximate English gloss. These postpositions are never independent words, but
rather cliticize onto the preceding word, which is usually, but not always, the final

below.
4.6. POSTPOSITI0 1\TS                                                             105
 word of an NP or another postposi tion. Cli ticized postpositions are quite comn1on
in Amazonian languages to the east of Awa Pit (Doris Payne 1990b:220); and to
 the west, Epena Pedee has a system of case marking through postpositions very
similar to Awa Pit , with the postpositions attaching to clauses as well as NPs
 (Harms 1994:65-79). A sin1ilar situation holds in Ika, spoken in northern Colom-
bia, where locative postpositions can cliticize onto clauses (Frank 1990:102-103).
        The initial phoneme of the postpositions undergo the usual within-word
phonetic realizations, with the exception of those beginning with /p/, which
becomes / w / after a vowel - as discussed in section 2. 2.1, this is the case for all
morpheme-initial /p/ after a vowel. This is clear evidence that the postpositions
forn1 one phonological word with the preceding element.
        Grammatically, however, there is a different situation. While previous
analyses of Awa Pit have considered the postpositions to be nominal suffixes
( Cal vache Duenas 1989, 0 ban do Ordonez 1992), there are clear reasons for ana-
lyzing then1 as separate grammatical words ( clitics) rather than parts of the
preceding word (suffixes), although not all types of evidence are found with all
postpositions.
        First, many of the postpositions (all those which have some relation to
location) have been found following other postpositions. This is not so unusual
in those cases where the first post position is the genitive postposition pa ( as
in example ( 124)), as sequences of two noun suffixes have been found in other
languages when the first is a genitive; but n1any also occur with one locational
postposition following another, as in exa.n1ple (125) :( 124)      Santos=pa=mal     nya. waa-y

3.5.5      Core, oblique a11d external fu11ctions
Andrews (1985:80-82) establishes three distinct types of syntactic functions. He
first distinguishes between external and internal functions, with the former not
actually forming a part of the basic clause structure and never bearing any specific
semantic role. The internal functions in turn can be divided into two types, core
and oblique. 'The distinction between core and oblique functions is a little less
distinct, being very much language-dependent. Core functions always include
A, S and o, and any other syntactic functions which are similar in behaviour
to these. The core functions cornmonly correspond to 'syntactic cases' ( that
is, those cases which express a wide variety of sernantic roles) , while oblique
functions correspond to 'sen1antic cases' ( those cases which tend to have a more
or less one-to-one correspondence with semantic roles).
        In Awa Pit, there is a clearly identifiable external function - the external
topic. Those N Ps which fill this position do not form a part of the basic clause
on phonological grounds, nor are they specifically related to any semantic role in
the clause with which they appear. 27
        Subject, Object and Second Object quite clearly cover syntactic functions
which are core, and can be considered core grarnmatical relations. Subject and
Object are used to code A, s and o, and consequently are core by definition. The
Second Object grammatical relation is very similar to the Object grammatical
relation, suggesting that it is probably core, and there is supporting evidence
for this. The Second Object is involved in a minor way in syntactic processes,
being necessary for causativization, where the Second Object of a causativized
transitive or di transitive corresponds to the Object of the non-causativized verb.
        The Copula Con1plement should also be considered a core grammatical
relation. While there is less evidence for this, the Copula Complement does
have distinctive syntactic properties - it cannot be ellipsed and appears to form
part of the predicate, and may consist of an adjective phrase as well as noun
phrases, postpositional phrases and subordinate clauses - and it codes a variety
  26 Neither  of these conditions actually holds for the second argument of the stative two-
argument verb pyan ' know'.

of semantic roles.
        All other syntactic functions in Awa Pit appear to be oblique. They are
not involved in any gram1natical processes, and correspond relatively closely with
semantic roles. The various oblique syntactic functions will not be discussed here,
because they are necessarily coded in Awa Pit through the use of postpositions,
and the close correspondence with sen1antic roles means that it is si1nplest to
discuss the oblique functions together with the various postpositions, which will
be done in section 5.4.
        In Awa Pit, then, there is an external function, the external topic, dis-
cussed in section 14.2. There are four core gran1matical relations, the Subject,
Object, Second Object and Copula Complement, which were discussed in the
previous sections. There are a variety of oblique syntactic functions, which cor-
respond to the semantic roles taken by these functions, and these will be discussed
in section 5.4 together with the postpositions which encode these functions.","[99, 100]"

5.2.3.2       Purposive adjectivizationsThe adjectivizer suffix mu has a number of functions, and one of these is to
form a nominal modifier from a transitive verb, indicating that the noun being
n1odified ""is (good) for Verb-ing"" or ""is to be Verb-ed"". The noun is necessarily
something which could fill the Object slot of the mu-marked verb. \Nhen used
attributively rather than predicatively, the mu-n1arked verb follows the noun it
1nodifies as deverbal adjectives do, rather than preceding it like lexical adject-
ives. The only examples of an attributive use of purposive adjectivizations which
have been found are together with the verb waa 'there is', which is intransit-
ive. Consequently it is not clear where case marking postpositions would occur
with a noun modified by a purposive adjectivization. However, given the paral-
lels with the deverbal adjectives, it appears likely that the noun and a following
mu-marked verb form one noun phrase. (156)     [ chicha ku-m       ] waa-y
           [ chicha eat-ADJ ZR ] there:is-NON LOCUT
           'There's chicha ( an alcoholic drink) to drink.'","[142, 143]"
"3.5.3.1       Case 111arkingThe case-marking system of Awa Pit is nominative-accusative, as was shown in
section 3.5.2. The Subject of a sentence is always unn1arked for case, while an
o 1nay be marked. In general, as was shown in the examples in that section, a
referential hun1an NP is 1narked as Accusative in o function while other NPs in
this function are unn1arked.
        Marking only referential human NPs in O function with Accusative mark-
ing, while leaving others unmarked, is not uncommon in the languages of the
world. 19 It could, in theory, lead to confusion about whether a particular un-
marked non-human NP is in o function or not. In fact, it is usually clear from
context or semantics that a particular non-human referent is, or is not, in O
function. If ambiguity ren1ains, it is al ways possible to use explicit NPs for both
participants, and rely on the usual constituent order, with A preceding o, to
disan1biguate the syntactic functions:(60)        ishu==na.    pitikku            ku-m

5.2.2    ""Reflexives""
Awa Pit does not have a specific reflexive construction; however the techniques
used to convey the notion of reflexivity are more closely related to a nominal
reflexive system than a verbal one such as is found in Imbabura Quechua (Cole
1985: 134-135).
        Reflexive situations are reported in a variety of ways in Awa Pit, with
two being the most common. With non-third person, there is always the option
of simply including separate Nominative and Accusative pronouns referring to
the same person, and the same structure is sometimes used for third person as
well, although then there is ambiguity between reflexive and non-reflexive; this
same sort of system, with the an1biguity present, is used in a few other South
An1erican languages such as Piraha (Everett 1986:215-217). In this case, and

Subject or Locutor Undergoer (see chapter 8), the Locutor Undergoer marking
is chosen.
        l\!Iore frequently, reflexives are stated as sentences with an ellipsed Subject,
which can be understood to refer to the sa1ne participant as the Object ( which
may also be elli psed). In this case, an adjunct postposi tional phrase ap miIJpayIJ
""through n1y own idea', paynya miIJpayIJ ' through his / her own idea', and so forth
( section 5.4.4) is normally present:(135)    ap    miIJ==pa==yIJ                  tit    kway- ti-s

terpretation: the second sentence, for example, would also be appropriate in a
context in which he got into a fight with the intent of having someone hit him.
That is, the PP involving miIJ can also be used in non-reflexive contexts. The
use of an adjunct to suggest a reflexive context in sentences like these is also
found in Retuara, where reflexive clauses usually contain an adverbial phrase like
'knowingly' (Strom 1992:133-134).","[137, 138]"

count needs to be altered in the light of the relationship of these three languages
with Guambiano and Totor6, perhaps pushing the boundary of the Barbacoan-
speaking peoples n1uch further to the north.
        Typologically, Awa Pit also appears to be much more Andean than coastal
or Amazonian. There are many typological similarities between all three groups,
but certain differences. The closest Amazonian languages tend to have highly
complex classifier systems (Doris Payne 1990b:220), completely absent from Awa
Pit, and a much more polysynthetic structure (Doris Payne 1990b:214). While
all languages in the region tend towards cliticized postpositions for case n1arking,
there are relatively few postpositions in many Amazonian languages. Coastal
languages such as Epena Pedee are ergative-absolutive (Harms 1994:9-10); while
Awa Pit, Quechua and many languages on the Amazon side of the Andes are
nominative-accusative and have similar case systems. Indeed, many of the case
forms given by Levinsohn (1976) for Inga Quechua appear similar or identical to
those of Awa Pit: an accusative and locative ta; a genitive pa; and a locative
meaning encoded by mal in Awa Pit versus ma in Inga Quechua. Unfortunately,
there is no evidence of lexical similarities, apart from a few words which are likely
to be loans (Inga Quechua forms first): 'father' (tayta, taytta), 'cattle' (huagra,
wakata [wayara]), 'gun' (illapa, iyaIJpa), and so on.","[38, 39]"
"There are four possible explanations for this alternation between s and w, as-
suming that it is not simply random: the alternation may be marking a semantic
distinction, a pragmatic distinction, it may be related to language change, or it
may be related to the origin of the person-marking system itself. Of course, these
explanations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. These various possibilities
will be discussed shortly, after all the relevant data is given.
       In the data, only the verbs listed above were found to take s as well as
w. but it seems likely that all intransitive verbs with a single participant who is
an undergoer can take this alternation, and that it is simply a lack in the data
that some verbs in this semantic class - for example nilta- ·shiver · - were never
found with s marking. Certainly all verbs from this class which were tested had
the possibility of s marking as well as w n1arking. It is also worth pointing out
that all these verbs are intransitive. This is probably a semantic rather than a
syntactic fact, as no t ransitive verbs \Vere found where the grammatical Subject
was semantically an undergoer.

        These examples clearly show thats does not mark a Locutor Object: there
are cases where a Locutor Subject is ""cross-referenced"" through a verb suffix s
also. Perhaps even n1ore interesting are those cases where the person 1narker s
is present, but is not cross-referencing any participant at all. This can occur in
sentences with intransitive verbs, either stative or active, and in copula sentences,
and indicates that the action or state affected a Locutor entity, even though that
entity was not, strictly speaking, a participant in the action or state, being some
sort of experiencer of the action or state:(394)   kerosin way-a-s

        ' I found [the bag] was very heavy. 'It is in1portant to note that these verbs remain one place (intransitive) or two
place ( copula) verbs. It is not the case that an extra argun1ent, an Obj ect, is
added to the verb, as can be seen by the fact that such an argun1ent cannot be
expressed:(398)   (*na-wa)      alu   ki-ma-ti-s
        ( lSG-ACC) rain( 1) rain(2)-COM P-PAST-LOCUT: u NDER
        ' It rained on me.'
       This ""cross-referencing"" of an affected non-argument is similar in intent to
the ethical dative construction of languages such as Spanish, where an affected
party can be indicated in a sentence by including it as a dative argument:(399)    el    perro me        muri6
         the dog      me. DAT died
         ' The clog [went and] died on me.'
However there are two clear differences. Firstly, the affected party in Spanish
is , truly, an argument, and can be expressed by any appropriate form, either
pronoun or full NP, and can be any person:(400)    el    perro le         muri6 a         Santos
         the dog      hi1n.DAT died     to(DAT) Santos
         ' The clog [went and] died on Santos.'
8.3.    THE PAST PARADIGi\![                                                              197
In Awa Pit, only an affected Locutor can be indicated, and only in the verb,
not by an argument. Equally, even if it were an argun1ent in Awa Pit, it would
necessarily be a core argument (being cross-referenced in the verb), while in
Spanish and other languages the ethical dative is at least arguably an oblique
argument, implying no change in the verb valency. 9
        This s person marking in the Past paradigm is thus clearly not cross-
referencing an Object in the way in which w cross-references a grammatical
Subject. An s indicates that a Locutor entity is affected by the action in some
way, whether a participant in the action or not. This concept of 'affectedness' is,
however, very broad, and perhaps better stated as 'involved in the action but not
as a (volitional controlling) agent'. In any sentence with a Locutor Object (as
well as in some sentences without a Locutor Object) the verb will be marked with
s regardless of the semantic role of the Obj ect; it is most commonly a patient,
but may also be, for example, a theme, in which case it is not 'affected' by the
action in the usual sense of the word:(401)     J ua.n=na  (na-wa)    izh-ti-s
          Juan =TOP ( 1SG-A CC) see-PAST-LO CUT: UN DER
           Juan saw me. 'It is, however, involved in the action, and not as an agent.
        It is interesting to return a.t this point to the possible explanations for the
alternation betweens and w vvith some intra.nsitive verbs given above, now that
other uses of s have been seen. The four explanations suggested there were: a
semantic distinction, a pragmat ic distinction, language change, and the origin of
the systen1. The first two of these tend to appear less likely, now that it is clear
that there is not simply an alternation between s and w with some intransitive
verbs, but thats has a habit of :'popping up"" in unexpected places even when there
is no argun1ent that it can cross-reference. That is , a semantic difference between
the use of s and w based on some element such as ""volition"" or ""control"" such
as occurs in n1any fluid-s languages (Dixon 1994:78-83 ); a pragmatic distinction
based on the division between foregrounded and backgrounded activities such as
occurs in the Peruvian Arawakan language Asheninca (Judith Payne & David
Payne 1991); or a marking system such as that of Yagua where So marking is
favoured in contexts where a n1ain character is n1oved to a new scene or at ""points
of episodic climax"" (Doris Payne & Thomas Payne 1990:257) will hardly explain
the use of s in clauses where there is no Locutor participant at all.
        The third possibility for alternation suggested above was language change.
It could be assun1ed that, whatever the original use of s and w was, only one
of them was originally used with verbs such as pit- 'sleep', and that language
change is leading to the other appearing there also. The most logical a priori
suggestion here is that these verbs originally only occurred with s, and that w
is extending its range , perhaps from marking agents to marking Subjects, with
   9
    There are also languages \vhich add an affected argun1ent through the use of an applicative
construction - here , however , there is usually an extra applicative n1orpheme in the verb
complex, indicating the change in the verb valency.
198                                             CH}lPTER 8. PERSON MARI{ING
these intransitive verbs now taking w by analogy with the many intransitive
verbs which have an agent as their single argument. This would, in fact, make
the postulated ""original"" system very similar to the northern Colombian language
Ika, which has a basically nominative/ accusative cross-referencing system, but a
very small group of about twelve intransitive verbs cross-reference their subjects
in the same way as transitive verbs cross-reference their objects (Frank 1990:22);
the Ika system is, however, a cross-referencing system, with the person marking
only used to mark participants.
        Of course it could be considered that a change in the system is a response
of semi-speakers acting under the influence of a largely nominative/ accusative
system in Awa Pit and a completely nominative/ accusative system in Spanish.
There are two reasons to reject this analysis, one language-internal and one theor-
etical. Language-internally it is clear that the system of 1narking is very unusual
in itself, and there seems to be no reason to assun1e that this apparent additional
peculiarity is in any way a language death phenomenon, rather than simply a
fact of the system. And while the evidence fro1n changing case-marking systen1s
in language death situations is rather scanty, this phenomenon has been studied
for Dyirbal, where an originally ergative system is replaced by accusative mark-
ing (Schmidt 1985a, Schmidt 1985b ). In this case, however, individuals were not
found to be varying from one form to another, but rather ""each individual was
highly consistent in his / her response"" (Schmidt 1985a:382) as to the form and use
of ergative marking. This contrasts markedly with the Awa Pit situation, where
the san1e speaker alternates between one form and another. The situations are
slightly different, of course , in that in the hypothesized ""original"" Awa Pit sys-
tem there are only a few verbs with unusual 111arking, while in Dyirbal an entire
structural system is altering.
        For the moment the precise synchronic and historical value of these Awa
Pit 1narkers will be left open. The possibility that these alternations between
s and w are inherent to the system will be taken up again when this system is
compared with similar syste1ns in other languages and in discussing the origin
of the system, where it will be seen that the alternation is a likely synchronic
outcome of a potential historical change.","[216, 217, 218, 219]"

This indicates that there must be two noun phrases, in apposition, as the Topic
1narker and case marking can only be marked once on each noun phrase within
the sentence.
        Agentive nominalizations are clearly quite close semantically to relative
clauses. However they do not, in fact, comply with the conditions set by many
definitions of relative clauses, as there is no domain noun which is further re-
stricted by a subordinate clause. Even when the ""domain noun"" is explicitly
expressed, it is placed in apposition to the nominalization, and thus is not in
the same noun phrase. This construction is thus not a relative clause according
to the definitions of I{eenan & Comrie ( 1977) or Comrie ( 1981), which both re-
quire a domain noun in the same noun phrase as the restrictive clause. I{eenan
(1985:142), on the other hand, takes the defining feature of relative clauses to
be the presence of a restrictive clause, and considers that a do1nain noun is not
necessary in a relative clause construction - and under this definition, this con-
struction is perhaps a relative clause, although the use of identical 1norphology
on acljecti ves is somewhat disturbing in this case. 20
        There are a variety of languages where a nominalization functions as a
""relative clause"" n1odifying a head noun. For exa1nple, Davis (1973:211) gives the
following sentence fron1 Luiserio, where the presence of locative 1narking on the
verb 'make' shows it has been nominalized:
(718)     I(u?a·l-up nive?-qa   wfw-IJa        nU-SI]aki pu-lo?xa-IJa
          fly-PRES   be:in-PRES acorn:mush-LOC my-wife her-make-LOC
          'There is a fly in the acorn mush my wife n1ade.'
While this exa1nple is not structurally identical to the Awa Pit no1ninalizations
with an apposed noun (for example, in Luiseiio the possessive prefix nu is only
possible on nouns), there are clear similarities, with the ""head noun"" and the
nominalization both separately case marked. In fact, all elements of an NP in
Luiseiio are normally case-marked, however in addition to this, while the ""head
noun"" is usually found immediately before the nominalization, this is not neces-
sarily the case, and the two elements can be found in a variety of places through
the sentence (Davis 1973:206). It is thus not entirely clear whether the head noun
and the nominalization in Luiseiio are in the same NP or in apposition.
        In their discussion of nominalizations being used as ""relative clauses"", Com-
rie & Thon1pson (1985) make the following comments which are highly relevant
to Awa Pit:        It is not difficult to understand how a nominalization can function
        as a relative clause: the nominalization and the noun with which it
  20 See section   10.4 for more explicit descriptions of the various definitions of relative clauses.

            is in construction can be thought of as two juxtaposed nominal ele-
            ments [NoM][NoM], the modifying relationship between then1 being
            inferred by the language-users ( rather than being specified by the
            grammar, as it is in languages with specific relative clause morpho-
            logy).
                                                     (Comrie & Thompson 1985:394)            While it is possible to consider the construction with mika/tuz to con-
    stitute a relative clause construction, at least under some definitions of relative
    clauses, it is perhaps unnecessary in terms of developing the simplest possible
    grammar of a language. If this structure is considered a nominalization - func-
    tioning as it does without a domain noun, to create an agentive nominalization
    - then other grammatical structures, such as apposition, can be invoked to al-
    low speakers to interpret sentences containing a nominalization and a head noun
    in apposition in the sa1ne way in which an English speaker would interpret a
    domain noun plus restrictive clause construction. Furthermore, by adopting this
    analysis of these constructions it is unnecessary to construct a restriction on this
    type of clause formation in Awa Pit to explain why the relativized constituent is
    necessarily the Subject of the subordinate clause: by analyzing this structure as
    an agentive nominalization, the restriction is inbuilt.
           The conclusion, then, is that while these agentive norninalization con-
    structions can be invoked to cover son1e of the same areas as relative clauses
    in English ( and other languages), there is no reason to consider them relative
    clauses in their own right: the grammar is simpler and clearer if they are simply
    considered nominalizations.
           It is interesting to hypothesize about the history of these agentive nominal-
    izations. If one simply examines the nominalizations involving mu , and compares
    them with the relative clauses involving mu (see section 10.4), it seems that it
    would be possible to consider that mika and tuz are, essentially, du1n1ny nouns ,
    equivalent to the English one, simply on the basis of structural equivalency:    (719)     na==na            [ kal       ki-m     ] awa

"                     Similar to this use is its use in a noun phrase to mean 'everything', in which case
                     the head is never expressed:
                                                .

                     In addition to its occurrence in NPs, wan can also be used in the manner adverbial
                     position. In some cases it appears to have the same meaning here, appearing to
                     have ""floated"" fron1 the NP as some quantifiers do in such diverse languages as
                     English and the Uto-Aztecan language Pima (iYiunro 1984):                     (980)    awa==na       wan a-t      kway-mtu-y

common ideas of topic, and is often expressed as though occurring at the level of
the sentence: ""the topic of a sentence is the thing which the proposition expressed
by the sentence is about"" (Lambrecht 1994:118). As Giv6n (1990:902) notes,
however, ""at the level of a single event / state, 'topic' - 'what is talked about' or
'what is important' - is meaningless"". What is in fact meant is that, at the level
of the discourse, a referent has ""certain discourse properties having to do with the
degree of cognitive and pragmatic accessibility it has in the discourse"" (Lambrecht
1987:375), and then at the sentence level this referent is taken as topic, with the
remainder of the sentence saying something about that referent. A topic marker
in these terms is some morphological material or syntactic construction which is
used to ""turn the attention of the hearer to some identifiable participant in the
discourse, and then to assert something of that participant"" (Aissen 1992:50).
        A similar, though slightly different, formulation is suggested by Doris
Payne ( 1995), on the basis of the experimental work on comprehension of Gerns-
bacher (1990) and Gernsbacher & Hargreaves (1992). They claim that compre-
hension requires a stage of ""laying a foundation"" for a mental structure, then other
information is ""mapped"" onto this foundation to develop the structure. Payne
considers that it is not       too far afield to see Gernsbacher's experimentally-validated ""found-
       ation"" of a n1ental representation as roughly what the Functional
       Sentence Perspective school and Creider himself were getting at in
       talking about the ""theme"" or ""topic"" of a discourse section·. I sug-
       gest that whatever a comprehender takes as the foundation for a
       mental structure can linguistically be referred to as the thematic
       concept or referent of that structure - this is the concept onto
       which other information is rnapped.
                                                           (Payne 1995:451)This idea of a foundation, while in many ways similar to the ""aboutness"" claim, is
important later in contrasting na-marked complements with na-marked adjuncts.
        Looking at complements with full nouns in noun phrases and postposi-
tional phrases, these ideas of ""aboutness"" or the idea of a ''foundation"" appear to
explain this use of the Topic marker in Awa Pit: it shows which (if any) of the
expressed complements of a predicate are the one the discourse is about, the one
onto which other inforn1ation in the sentence is mapped.
        The distribution of the Topic marker on some pronouns is different from
that occurring with full nouns. It appears that the third-person pronouns, us
'he/ she' and uspa 'they', show the same distribution of Topic marker as the
nouns, but the first- and second-person pronouns are quite different: when explicit
first- or second-person pronouns are used in Awa Pit, they are almost always
accompanied by the Topic marker. Explicit pronouns are not, in fact, often used
in Awa Pit, with a combination of context and person-marking in the predicate
usually being sufficient to determine who the participants in any given event
          I""'         14.2. THE TOPIC i\lIA RI(ER                                                     363
                      are. If explicit first- or second-person pronouns are used, this is usually done
                      to introduce a change in topic, stress the participant in question, or establish a
                      contrast between one participant and another. In these cases, the participants
                      indicated through the use of the pronouns are highly topical, and consequently
         ,.,          the pronouns are marked with na. Non-topical pronouns are only used when
                      there would otherwise be confusion about the participants in an event; and in     I
     111
              i
                      these cases, the pronouns are not marked with na. For example, when a speaker
                      uses a subordinate clause of time involving an action performed by him- or herself
                      to establish the time of another event, the speaker is not a topical participant
                      in the major action, but a pronoun must be used to clarify the meaning, as the
                      subordinate clause verb is not marked for person:
          I
          I
          I           (1009) na        a-ka==na       kal

"       The correspondences for underived and derived transitive verbs are thus:       (296)      Underived              Derived
                                         Subject ( causer)
                     Subject     ¢==}    Object
                      Object     ¢==}    Second Object               In earlier work on causativization (for example , Con1rie 1975, Comrie
       1981 ), the focus was on the ""paradigm case"" of 111orphological causativization,
       whereby the Subject of the underived verb corresponds to the Indirect Object of
       the derived verb in the causativization of a transitive verb. Cases such as that of
       Awa Pit were 111erely considered as ""doubling on direct object"" (Co111rie 1975:14-
       16). In fact, however, a process much more complex than ""doubling"" is occur-
       ring: rather than simply a correspondence of the Subject of the underived verb
       to another grammatical relation, both of the semantic roles filling the grammat-
       ical roles of Subject and Object of the underived verb are required to change
       grammatical relations. As pointed out by Baker (1988:164-165), while this cor-
       respondence of Subject to Object and Object to Second Object is rare in the
       languages of the world, it has been found in a number of languages, including
       Cebuano (Gibson 1980) and Choctaw (Davies 1981); it also occurs in Imbabura
       Quechua, where a subject becomes a direct object, while the original object re-
       mains marked with accusative ( rather than dative, used for di transi ti ves) but
       shows no other object properties (Cole 1985:135- 141). 9
               The Object status of the causee can be seen from sentences involving both
       the Causative or Auxiliative marker and the First Person Object Iinperative zha
       (see section 3.5.3). Thus compare the following two sentences:
          9
           A similar but not identical change in gram1natical relations of two arguments happens in
       other languages , where the Subject of the underived verb form corresponds to the Object of
       the derived fonn, and the Object of the underived forn1 corresponds to an oblique relation; this
       occurs, for exan1ple, in Tolai (Mosel 1984: 155).

"As noted in section 4.4.1, the head of an NP can never be elli psed if the NP has
a bare noun modifier, presumably to avoid ambiguity in the status of this noun.
Purposive adjectives and non-possessive PPs have also never been found without
a head ( although they are used as Copula Complements). Finally, demons tr a ti ve
adjectives are never found without heads; the related demonstrative pronoun is
used instead.

5.2.6      ""Plural"" n1arking and 11on1i11alizatio11s
With the exception of personal pronouns, nominals in Awa Pit do not have nun1-
ber as a grammatical category, and thus awa can indi cate one person, a number
of people, or people as a group. 9 However there is one suffix, the Collective ac-
tion suffix tuzpa, which can be attached to nouns to show something si1nilar to
nu111ber. Rather than simply marking n1ultiple referents , the suffix marks that
the referents form a coherent group, sin1ilar to the collective ""plural"" in Tlingit
( Anderson 1985: 17 4); additionally, the group has to have been acting together to
perforn1 some process:(197)     ampu-tuzpa kal       ki-ni-ma-ti

"
4.4.4        Demo11strative adjectives
The subclass of demonstrative adjectives is very small, containing only two words,
 an 'this' and sun 't hat'. In a string of adjectives, these words may only appear
before all other adjectives (see section 5.2).
        Positionally, the demonstrative adjectives and the possessive adjectives
(see section 4.4.5) form a single subclass, and it is impossible to combine words
from the two subclasses. However there are some distributional differences. The
possessive adjectives may be used as Copula Complements or predicates, while
the demonstrative adjectives cannot; and the possessive adjectives can also be
used in an NP with an ellipsed head , while under these circumstances the demon-
strative pronouns rather than the demonstrative adjectives are used, although it
is possible that historically the demonstrative pronouns have developed from the
demonstrative adjectives. 6
4.4.5        Possessive adjectives
The subclass of possessive adjectives is quite closely associated with the de111on-
strative adjectives, although there are differences (see section 4.4 .4), with only
one word fro111 the two subclasses permitted in any string of adjectives .
       There are only three possessive adjectives in Awa Pit , corresponding to
the three singular personal pronouns (see section 4.3.3): ap 'my', up 'your' and
paynya 'his / her'. There are no special plural possessive adjectives - to indicate
something which belongs to more than one person, either the singular possessive
adjective of the appropriate person may be used, or else the plural personal
pronoun is placed before the noun which is possessed. 7
4.5        Verbs
Like many South American languages , Awa Pit is a strongly verb-marking lan-
guage, with a great deal of information being packed into the verb. \ /erbs are
easily recognizable, being the only words which can be marked with many affixes,
showing such things as aspect, tense and mood ( see chapter 9) as well as a num-
ber of deri vational affixes ( see section 6 .4). With the exception of a few equati ve,
identity and description sentences (see section 3.6), all sentences in Awa Pit must
contain a verb; even minimal responses in answer to polar or content questions
contain a verb - in response to the equivalent of ""Who went?"" a speaker must

     will say the equivalent of either ""I went"" or ""I did not go"".
             There are three cross-cutting classifications of verb roots which 111ust be
     taken into account in establishing the verbal subclasses. These are the distinc-
     tions between active and stative verb roots, between simple and co111pound verb
    roots, and between verb roots of various argument frames ( valence and transit-
    ivity). In addition there are a small nun1ber of irregular verb roots. Aside from
    the copula, which has a stem i in the Present and a otherwise, the irregular verbs
    all consist of roots with an alternation in their ending between ku, which occurs
    before a suffix beginning with a bilabial or velar consonant or a vowel, and kwa,
    which is the form they take otherwise. The most common of these is ku / kwa-
    'eat '; others are ishku- 'scare', kutku- 'tell a lie' and walku- 'steal'.
             The n1ajor classification of Awa Pit verb roots is into two groups, the
    stative verbs and the active verbs. This distinction is a semantic distinction
    between those verbs describing predicates which are inherently in1perfective -
    such as i 'be', mij 'have' and pana 'be standing' - versus those which are not
    inherently in1perfective - such as i 'go', pak 'harvest' and pyan 'hit'. This
    sen1antic distinction corresponds to a morphological distinction: active verbs n1ay
    be suffixed by the I111perfective aspect n1arker, while stative verbs cannot take this
    suffix, being inherently in1perfective. This distinction is important in a number
    of cases; for exan1ple, the present tense is unmarked , with just the stein form for
    stative verbs, but the stem plus In1perfective for active verbs (followed potentially
    by person 111arking). Only two verbs have been found which apparently can be
    either active or stative, but in fact there are meaning distinctions between the
    two formally identical verb roots: shaa 'walk ' is an active verb, while shaa 'be
    around' is a stative verb; tu ' lie clown' is an active verb, but tu 'be permanently,
    be lying down' is a stative verb. As will be discussed below ( section 6.4.2.1), verb
    roots suffixed with the Desiderati ve n1arker n1ay also be either active or stative,
    al though there is no discernable meaning difference in this case.
             The vast majority of verbs in Awa Pit are simple verbs - the lexical
    meaning of the verb is carried by a single phonological and gran1matical word.
    However there are a number of compound verbs in the language, where the lex-
    ical meaning is expressed in two phonological words. Sometimes the words in
    a com pound verb are also individually meaningful words in the language, and
    the combined n1eaning is related to the meanings of the two individual words,
    although the precise meaning n1ay be unpredictable. In other cases, one of the
    two phonological words in a compound verb is not a separate lexical item in the
    language. Con1pound verbs are al ways active, and have a variety of argun1ent
    structures. As compound verbs can be understood by a slight modification of the
    framework required for simple verbs, they will be discussed following the simple
    verbs, in section 4.5.6.
             Verbs in Awa Pit may have zero, one, two or three 'obligatory ' arguments
    (complements). The use of the term 'obligatory ' is slightly odd here, as these
    arguments 111ay not necessarily appear in any given sentence, due to the use of
    both definite and indefinite argument ellipsis in Awa Pit. However there are some

tests which can be used to establish the nun1ber of complements of a verb - see
section 4.5.1.
        Different verbs require their complements to have different sets of gram-
matical relations. 8 Many verbs require some subset of core grammatical relations
- Subject, Object, Second Object , Copula Compl~ment - , but a few verbs
require some oblique gra1nmatical relations, such as a locational element.
        In the following discussion of verbal subclasses, verbs will be divided up on
the basis of their status as simple or compound verbs ( with all co1npound verbs
being discussed last, in section 4.5.6), on the basis of their subcategorization
frames (both number of argu1nents and the grammatical relations of those argu-
ments), and on the basis of the active/ stative distinction. Prior to the discussion
of the individual subclasses, the method for establishing verbal subcategorization
fra1nes will be discussed.","[115, 116, 117]"
"The First Person Object Imperative, then, singles out either the o of a transitive
verb or the first of the two non-Subject arguments of a ditransitive verb.
        The first non-Subject argu1nent of a ditransitive verb is thus 111orpho~
logically and syntactically equivalent to the O of a transitive verb; the second
non-Subject argument of a ditransitive verb is very similar to the o of a trans-
itive verb, in tenns of its n1orphology, but there are so1ne morphological and
syntactic differences. The first non-Subject argument of ditransiti ves will thus
be considered to form, together with the transitive o, the grammatical relation
of Object; the second non-Subject argument also requires a grammatical relation
rather than just a syntactic function, as it is required for the process of causativ-
ization of a transitive verb ( see section 6 .4.1) - as· this relation is very sin1ilar
to the Object relation, it will be called Second Object.
        Typologically speaking, it is not unusual that, for example with the verb
kwin- 'give', the semantic role of recipient is coded by the Object, while the
gift is a Second Object. As Andrews (1985:125-126) points out, ""it is a striking
typological generalization that if the [two object] N Ps behave differently, it is the
one with the Recipient-like se1nantic role that behaves like a direct object [ie. in
the same way as o ]"".
        In summary, then, Awa Pit has two object-like grammatical relations:
Object, which has Accusative case 1narking if it is referential and human, controls
the use of the na number marking morphology on the verb, and can be referred to
with the special First Person Object Imperative form; and Second Object, which
has Accusative case marking if it ·is referential and human, but cannot control
number marking on the verb, nor be referred to through the First Person Object
Imperative form.

      3.5.4         Copula Co111plen1ent
      In addition to the grammatical relations of Subject, Object and Second Object,
      one further grammatical relation needs to be established for Awa Pit, the Copula .
      Complement. This relation is always unmarked, but has a number of features
      which distinguish it from the Subject grammatical relation.
              The 1najori ty of two-argument verbs (see section 4.5.4) clearly have a Sub-
      ject and an Object argument, according to the tests developed in the previous
      sections. However there are stative verbs such as the copula i and mij 'have'
      and two active verbs, nam- 'become ( change into)' and paa- 'become ( develop
      into)', which also take two arguments, but do not have an Object as their second
      argument. The first argument of these verbs is a Subject, being unmarked and
      controlling number marking, but the second argu1nent can be distinguished from
11(
      an Object, as it is never case 1narked, even when a referential hun1an (see ex-
      a1nple (76)), cannot control na number marking (in the case of the active verbs),
      and cannot be used in the First Person Object In1perative construction; 24 and
      this second argument n1ust also be distinguished from a Subject, as it cannot
      control number marking on the verb (see sentence (77)).","[97, 98]"
"6.3.3.4     Loan verbsAs noted a number of times in the previous sections, there is one case in which
co1npound verbs are formed in a fully productive fashion: when Spanish verbs
are used in Awa Pit. Spanish words from most word classes can be used in Awa
Pit with no change (beyond phonetic/ phonological alignment), as Awa Pit has
almost no morphology, except for verbs. However when a speaker wishes to use
a verb fro1n Spanish, the verb is put into a compound structure with ki- 'do~
happen', and this second element can then carry the morphology. The Spanish
verb itself is placed in its most basic forn1, the third person singular present
indicative form. Thus from the Spanish trabajar 'work', an Awa Pit verb trabaja
ki- 'work' may be formed, or frorn con tar 'count' comes cuenta ki- 'count'.
       This process of forn1ing con1pound verbs fron1 non-native words through
the use of an ""auxiliary"" verb n1eaning ' do' can be con1pared in an interesting way
with similar constructions in a number of other languages. 7 Japanese appears
to have a sin1ilar construction using the verb suru ' do' - thus doraibu-suru is
formed from English drive (Hinds 1986:371-2). It must be noted, however, that
this construction is only used with foreign loan nouns, not verbs; and the hyphen
presumably indicates that these two elements can never be separated.
       Clearer parallels are with Indian languages, whether Dravidian ( such as
Tamil) or Indo-European (such as Panjabi). In the majority of these languages
there are a series of complex verbs, formed by combining an element such as a
noun, verb or adjective with some sort of auxiliary, most commonly 'do'. Bi-
lingual Panjabi-English speakers in Birmingham have taken advantage of this
construction (Ron1aine 1985), and often use lexical i terns ( usually verbs) from
English, followed by the auxiliary k8rna ' do'. While it is not clear from Ro-
maine's discussion of Panjabi whether the resulting compound is a single word or
   7 \Vhile only examples of languages using an ""auxiliary"" verb 'do' will be looked at here , thereare other ways of achieving the same ends. For example, Warlpiri has a productive system of
compound verbs, and English loan verbs are entered into the language using this pattern (Bavin
& Shopen 1985:82); however as cases such as these do not involve a verb meaning 'do ', they
will not be discussed here .
1''      6.4.   PRODUCTIVE DERI,IATIONS _                                                  157
          two words, the equivalent construction in Tan1il discussed in Annamalai (1978) ,
          using English verbs and the ""auxiliary"" pa-9-9 u 'do', clearly does form two separate
         phonological words - as mentioned earlier, in Tamil an emphatic particle can
         occur between the first and second parts of the compound.
                  This use of a verb meaning 'do' to form verbs fron1 non-native words
         is thus found in a variety of languages, although its exact status is, perhaps ,
         a little unclear. Annamalai's (1978) discussion of Tan1il is in the context of
11:1
11
         ""the anglicised Indian languages: a case of code mixing"", and Romaine's ( 1985)
         article likewise considers the Panjabi construction as some torm of mixed system;
         however in both languages there is a relatively high number of compound verbs
         which do not involve non-native elements. In his discussion of Japanese, on the
     I   other hand, Hinds ( 1986) discusses this structure being used with English loans
Ijl
ii
         and Chinese-based words, but as a loan structure, not as code mixing - this is
     I   presumably established on the basis that the majority of Japanese speakers are
         not bilingual speakers of Chinese.
                 In Awa Pit it would appear that these uses of Spanish, as other uses of
         Spanish words, range on a continuum fron1 true loans through to tag-switching ,
         the use by bilinguals of a single lexical item from Spanish in the midst of Awa Pit.
         A few of the compound verbs involving Spanish words, such as trabaja ki- ' work',
         appear to be well fixed in the language, and understood and used by all speakers ,
         and indeed the only way of expressing the concept in question ( the native word
         kal ki- 'work' is not used for paid work); while others appear to be ""once off'' uses
         when a speaker temporarily cannot recall an Awa Pit word - indeed, son1etimes
         a speaker will use one of these Spanish-based compound constructions , then this
         will be replaced in the following sentence by a native verb. Thus a relatively
         srnall number of these con1pounds involving Spanish verbs have to be entered
         into the lexicon of Awa Pit, while the n1ajority do not.","[177, 178]"
"This suggests that locational postpositions, at least, may not be noun suffixes
although analyses have been given which deal with case-stacking similar to this
in Australian languages ( see Dench & Evans ( 1988) for a survey; Andrews ( 1996)
for an analysis of semantic case-stacking in an LFG framework).
       Secondly, postpositions are found following an entire (non-finite) clause ,
as well as following an NP: 12(126)       us            ii-ta.=ki =na.      cruz
                                         '

         Demetrio return-INF==until, work(l) work(2)-FUT-LOCUT
         'U ntil Demetrio returns, I will work.'
Postpositions may follow the Imperfective Participle, the Perfective Participle
and the Infinitive. Clearly, as non-finite verbal forms, these are not nouns, and
hence the postpositions cannot be considered to be noun suffixes.
       There is also evidence that the postpositions go on the final element of
an NP, regardless of whether this is a noun or not. This evidence is perhaps less
strong, however it is required for the possessive marker pa and kasa ' with', as these
have not been found following another postposition, nor following a clause. The
evidence for pa being a postposition rather than a suffix is not strong, consisting
simply of sentences such as
(128)   Cfarmen==na   paynya nalpihsh==pa==ta
        Carn1en==TOP her     brother==POSS==in
        ayna-ma-ti-zi
        cook-COMP-PAST-NON LOCUT
        'Carmen cooked at her brother's [place).'
where the post position pa has scope over the entire preceding NP, paynya nalpihsh
'her brother'. The case for kasa. ' with' being a clitic postposition rather than a
no1ninal suffix is 1nuch stronger. When speakers of Awa Pit include Spanish words
in an Awa Pit sentence, the word order of the phrase containing one or more
Spanish words may either follow Spanish or Awa Pit word order. In particular,
using a Spanish noun or adjective or both within an NP will so1netimes cause
the NP word order to be noun- adjective rather than adjective-noun. In this case
the post position follows the adjective ( that is, the entire NP) rather than being
attached to the noun:
(129)   na==na           cuchillo n1ocho==kasa==yu  kuzhu
        lSG.(NOM)==TOP knife      blunt==with==REST pig
        nak-ma-ta-w
        skin-COM P-PAST-LOCUT:SU BJ
        'I skinned the pig with a blunt knife.'
Here it is clear that kasa follows the entire NP, and is thus clearly not a nominal
suffix but rather a cli tic to the entire NP.
        As a noun phrase may have an omitted head in Awa Pit, these post-
positions n1ay also, of course, follow such things as descriptive adjectives and
possessive adjectives:
(130)   katsa==wa kwizha

            'He went to his [house) .'","[126, 127, 128]"
"           The new noun phrase can be a Subject, but it can also be in another
    grammatical relation. If the noun phrase is within a case-marking postpositional
    phrase, the Additive marker kas occurs after the postposition:    (1046) Juan==ta==kas  Jose pyan-shi-mtu
           Juan =ACC=A DD Jose hit-DESID-IMPFPART
                ' Jose wants to hit Juan too ( as well as wanting to hit son1eone else). '            In the above exa111ples, by the tin1e the kas-111arked noun phrase was used,
    there \Vas already an expressed noun phrase to which it could be notionally added,
    either within the san1e sentence, as in sentence ( 1044) , or earlier in the discourse.
    However the Additive 111arker can also be used when a noun phrase in the current
    sentence is 111erely notionally in a larger group. For exan1ple, there are sentences
    such as:    (1047) awa==na tunya=kas ku-m
           Awa=TOP rat =A DD eat-ADJZR
                'The Awa eat rats ( an1ong other things). '    Here the speaker used the Additive marker to mark tunya 'rat', to say that this
    was one of many things that the Awa eat. 8
           When used in a negative proposition, the same idea of 'one of a group' 1s
    expressed, although in reverse. There are examples such as    (1048) pala==kas       shi  kwa-t         ki,           trabaja
           plantain= ADD NEG eat-PFPART be.NEG.(IMPFPART) work(l)
           ki-mtu
           work(2)-IMPFPART
           'Having not eaten even a plantain, I'm working.'
       8
           It was perhaps particularly i1nportant for the speaker to point out that this is only one of
    many things eaten by the Awa, as · the local non-indigenous people find this one of the more
    ""primitive"" features of the Awa, and the Awa are aware of this.
l
374                                          CHAPTER 14. DISCOURSE CLITICSPlantains are one of the major bases of the Awa diet. Thus here the speaker is
noting that, of all the things which he could have eaten, he has not even eaten a
plantain.
       The Additive marker is also used commonly, though not always, with
the interrogative/ negative pronouns (section 12.2) when these are being used as
negative pronouns. That is, words such as min 'who, no-one' can either be used as
interrogatives or negatives - in the former case, they are usually accompanied
by the Interrogative marker ma (see section 14.5), while as negatives they are
usually accompanied by the Additive 1narker:(1049) min==kas    shi a-ma-y

Part- whole relations are encoded in the same way as possession also, with the
whole as the modifier, and the part as the head noun. The modifier whole may
be a referential human (in which case the construction with pa or a possessive
adjective is used), or a non-referential human or a non-human ( encoded through
a bare noun modifier) :6
   5
      It should be noted that while alienable possession , kinship relations and ""possession"" of
body parts are treated identically within an NP, there is a difference in the coding of these
relations through verbs: alienable possession and kinship relations use the verb mil 'have',
while the ""possession"" of body parts is described using the verb waj 'have (body part)'.
    6
      It is interesting to note here that while Imbabura Quechua similarly encodes part-whole
relationships with either a genitive marker or a bare noun, the distinction in that language is
between animates and inanimates , rather than referential human and others ( Cole 1985: 117).

tional nouns, which are largely used to cover meanings for which many languages
have adpositions or complex adpositions. While the meaning of these is perhaps
not strictly that of a relation between two non1inals, formally they are construe~
ted in exactly the sa1ne way as possessive constructions, with the relational noun
as head, and the other nominal n1odifying this - referential human nouns take
an encli tic pa, or a possessive adjective if prono1ninalized; other nouns are simply
placed before the relational noun. This distinguishes this Awa Pit construction
from a similar construction found in Imbabura Quechua where, except for chawpi
'between, among', the ""complex postpositions"" are simply placed after the noun
to which they refer, with no marking indicating the relationship even for animate
nouns (Cole 1985:120-124). 7

                          However, in this section my intention is to make son1e beginning of an account of
                          the distribution of the morphe1ne na which occurs in Awa Pit. While this will rely
111
     I
                          on previous, often theoretical, discussions of topic, the intention is not to show
                          how ""topic"" is encoded in Awa Pit, but rather to explain where the Topic marker
                          na occurs. Thus it follows there will be an explicit use of structural information
                          to establish this distribution, rather than structural information being ""indirectly
                          permitted"".
                                  In order to discuss the semantics and pragmatics of the Topic marker na,
                          it is necessary to divide the elements marked with na into four groups. Many of
                          the definitions or discussions of topic in the literature only consider noun phrases
                          as topics - for example, Giv6n (1990:740) states that ""topicality is a property
                          of the nominal participants ('referents') ... of clauses"". As noted above, in Awa
                          Pit the Topic marker may occur on much more than just nominal participants.
                          However it seems to be useful to consider that there are different groups marked
                          with na: (1) there are those na-marked elements which are complements (that
                          is, required by the predicate); (2) there are those which are adjuncts (that is,
                          syntactically optional); (3) there are external topics; and ( 4) there are topical
                          clauses. Those elements which are complements are most commonly noun phrases
                          or postpositional phrases, and can be ""reference-tracked"" ( cf. Giv6n 1990:902-
                          910) through the discourse; in contrast, many adjuncts marked with na cannotI                     ,I

be tracked in this way, there being no ""entity"", even notionally, to which they
refer.
       In fact, there is also some language-internal evidence of a distinction
between Topic marking on complements and adjuncts, aside from the mean-
ing distinction which will be discussed below. With the exception of pronouns,
which are nearly always marked with the Topic marker, only one complement
in any sentence may be marked with na; in contrast, as many adjuncts (of the
appropriate types) as there are may be na-marked.
       In what follows, then, the uses of the Topic marker on complements will
be discussed, then its uses on adjuncts. Following this the two more problem-
atic cases ( the Topic marker on external elements, and on predicates) will be
considered in light of the complement-adjunct distinction.","[382, 383]"
"        As in the case of English in the above translation, some of these relational
nouns are transparently related to nouns or adjectives. For example, the rela-
tional noun used in the above example, isal, is cross-classified as a noun meaning
'top', and can be used without a following locative postposition in the same
""whole-part"" construction:(88)     mesa isal=na   natam izh-ma-t=na

         'He/ she is a worker.'
As seen in these examples, a nominalized clause as Subject is usually Topic-
marked, as is common for lexical Subjects. While these clausal nominalizations
are most often used in Subject role, they can be used in other roles, and in
this case the nominalization is followed by appropriate postpositions to mark the
grammatical role:
(709)    na==na           [ pishkatu pay-nin-tu==mika        ] ==ta
         1SG.(NOM)==TOP [ fish       buy-CAUS-IMPF==NMLZR.SG ]==ACC
         pyan-ta-w
         hit-PAST-LOCUT:SU BJ
         'I hit the one who was selling fish.'
       These clauses are clearly nominalizations rather than, for example, com-
plement clauses , as the nominalization can be accompanied by modifiers such as
adjectives at the level of the matrix clause in exactly the same way as any lexical
noun:
(710)    sun    [ a-t==mika              ] ==na ii-ma-ti
         that   [ co1ne-PFPART==NMLZR.SG ]==TOP die-COMP-TERM
         'That one that came has died.'
Thus the clause forms the functional equivalent of a noun, not a noun phrase.
        Given that in Awa Pit it is possible to ellipse a head noun, it could be
I)1aintained that the clauses marked with mika or tuz are in fact modifiers rather
than nouns in their own right, and that the head noun has been ellipsed. Indeed,
there are sentences which contain both a mika/tuz clause and a noun, which
would appear to support this analysis:
(711)    [ na-wa      sula    kwa-t==mika           ] kwizha nya
         [ 1SG-ACC bite(l) bite(2)-PFPART==NMLZR.SG ] dog    meat
         walkwa-ti-zi
         steal-PAST-NON LOC UT
         ' The dog which bit me stole the meat.'
However there are a variety of reasons for considering that sentences such as
this contain two separate noun phrases, both referring to the same entity, in an
appositional relationship. 18
  18 The sa1ne type of appositional relationship is found between nouns and clausal non1inaliz-ations in Macushi (Abbott 1991:93- 96) and Barasano (Jones & Jones 1991:149-153).

             To begin with, the order of the ""head noun"" and the ""1nodifier"" are not
      fixed. In contrast to the previous sentence, where the clause marked with mika
      occurs before the noun, there are sentences where the noun precedes the clause:      (712)       kwizha [ a-t=mika                 ]==na   ii-ma-ti

5.2.3     Modification of nou11s
Head nouns in an NP can often be modified, with the basic schema presented in
Table 5.1. However there are many restrictions and variations on this schema.
118                  CHAPTER 5. NPS, PPS A-ND COPULA COMPLEMENTS
It does not include deverbal adjectives or purposive adjectives, modification by
nouns , or modification of adjectives. For negation of elements within an NP, see
section 12.6.
        Of the nominals which can be heads of NPs, only the nouns can be modified
in this way. As was noted in section 4.3.3, personal pronouns can only be modified
by quantifiers, and in this case the quantifier appears after the pronoun rather
than before: au kutnya 'we three'. Other nominals - time and place nouns,
demonstrative pronouns and relational nouns - cannot be modified at all.
        Where it is semantically plausible, quantifiers and descriptive adjectives
themselves ~an be modified by the degree adverbs kwisha and pina or by the
comparative marker an, as can the head noun. These constructions are discussed
and exemplified in sections 13.6 and 13. 7 respectively.
        Not all postpositional phrases can occur within an NP. Those which have
been found are possessive ( discussed at length below), locational and similarity
PPs.
        Examples of a variety of NPs with basic modification are:(137)   alizh        kwizha

4.4.1     Disti11guisl1i11g adjectives fro111 non1i11als
As in many other languages, such as Imbabura Quechua (Cole 1985:73), no1n-
inals and adjectives are morphologically similar in Awa Pit. In addition, both
nominals and adjectives can appear as the only element in an NP (with the excep-
tion of demonstrative adjectives), as modifiers of an NP head (with the exception
of demonstrative pronouns, time and place nouns, relational nouns and some
personal pronouns), and as predicates ( with the exception of demonstrative pro-
nouns, demonstrative adjectives and some personal pronouns). Despite these
similarities in distribution, it is possible to distinguish nominals from adjectives.
        To begin with, there are two series of demonstratives. Demonstrative
pronouns n1ay only occur as the heads of NPs, while demonstrative adjectives
may only 1nodify NP heads. Additionally, there are different interrogatives for
questioning nominals and adjectives: min 'who ' or shi 'w hat ' for nominals, versus
min 'which' for adjectives.
4.4.    ADJECTIVES                                                                91
       While there is little nominal or adjectival morphology, there is one suffix ,
the Collective action suffix, used when a group of animate referents are acting
together in a task. This suffix has two forms, one for nouns ( tuzpa) , and a
separate fonn ( tuz) which occurs on adjectives when these are the only ele1nent
in an NP. 3
       Both adjectives and n1ost nominals may be used as n1odifiers of a head in
an NP, but the distribution is slightly different. When an explicit head is present ,
either may be used as a modifier:( 92)      katsa yal
           big     house
           Adj     N
           'a large house'(93)       uk    yal
           stone house
           N        N
           'a stone house'However once a referent has been introduced into a conversation , it may be
referred back to by a modifier only ( without an explicit head) if the n1odifier is
an adjective, but not by a n1odifier nominal:(94)       katsa
           big
           Adj
           'the large [house]'(95)      *uk
           stone
           N
           ( acceptable as 'the stone ' , but not as ' the stone [house]')This difference is, perhaps, unsurprising, as uk 'stone ' can refer simply to ' the
stone', and using it with no explicit head could lead to ambiguity.
         Equally, although both nominals and adjectives can be used as the only
word in an NP, there is evidence that they have different statuses. A nominal
used alone in an NP is truly the head of that NP ( which is why a nominal modifier
cannot be used without an explicit head); while an adjective used alone in an NP
is still modifying a head, it is simply that this head has been ellipsed. Within
a connected discourse it is possible to refer to an introduced referent by an NP
containing simply an adjective, such as(96)       katsa a-ti-zi
           big   come-PAST-NON LO CUT
           'The large [person] came.'
  3
      The latter form is also used on nominalizations.

Hovvever a sentence containing an NP with only an adjective cannot be used to
introduce a new participant , while an NP with a head noun can be used as the
first reference to a participant; thus while the previous sentence could be said
after a sentence such as 'Two people said they were con1ing today', it could not
be used without some prior sentence. Thus rather than the adjective being the
head of the NP, the adjective is modifying an ellipsed head, coreferential to a
previously mentioned nominal; Imbabura Quechua allows precisely the same use
of an adjective with an ""absent"" head (Cole 1985:76).
         Non1inals and adjectives, then, are similar in many ways in Awa Pi t, but
they can be distinguished - there are two sets of demonstratives and interrog-
atives , depending on whether a nominal or adjective is required; nominals can
only be used as n1odifiers with an explicit head, while adjectives can be used as
modifiers with or without an explicit head; and nominals can be used to intro-
duce new participants, while adjectives can only be used alone in an NP (with an
elli psed head) if the referent is already established.","[111, 112, 113]"
"      6.3.3.3       Con1pounds as incorporation      Setting aside the use of compound verbs involving a Spanish verb, the other com-
      pound verbs show many similarities to what is often considered as incorporation.
      Unfortunately, the majority of work has been done on noun incorporation - the
      incorporation of a noun into a verb. Examining those cases where a synchronic-
      ally existing noun in Awa Pit is identical to the first half of a co1npound verb, we
      can see that Awa Pit probably has what Mithun (1984) has tern1ed Type I and
      Type II noun incorporation.
              In Mithun's (1984) Type I incorporation , an argument of a verb has been
      incorporated into the verb, with the complex having one less argument than the
      original verb. It is not clear that this occurs in Awa Pit, although it may be the
      case with alu ki- ' rain'. If we assume that this verb is formed by incorporating
      the Subject alu ' rain' into the verb ki- ' happen ' then it is true that the resulting
      compound has one less argument than the original verb - none rather than
      one. However in her discussion of Type I noun incorporation Niithun (1984)
      only discusses transitive verbs becoming intransitive through the incorporation
      of an object. Equally, her Type I incorporated nouns are necessarily in particular
      semantic relations to the verb - patient, location or instrument - and alu 'rain'
      is probably none of these in alu ki- 'rain ' (though it does depend on how the term
      'patient' is interpreted).
             There is also only one example of what may be Type II noun incorporation
      in the data, the com pound s ula ku- 'bite' from s ula 'tooth' and ku- 'eat, drink'.
      This compound is , in fact, identical to the results of the system of ""instrumental
         6
             Except for some examples of Spanish verbs; see below.
156           CHAPTER 6.          VERB DERIVATLON A1VD VALENCY CHANGES
prefixes"" found in Uto-Aztecan languages, where ""a body-part term ... signals
the instrument by which the action of the verb is realized"", as in Pipil tan-kwa-
'bit' fron1 tan- 'tooth' and kwa- 'eat' (Campbell 1985:96). This appears to be an
example of Mi thun 's ( 1984) Type II incorporation; however unlike her Type II,
this incorporation does not affect the arguments (Subject==agent, Object==patient
in both cases), but rather incorporates an instrun1ental adjunct.
         While these few compound verbs with the first part identical to a noun
may be treated as noun incorporation, it is clear that the phenomenon extends
well beyond this in Awa Pit, with ""incorporation"" of nouns, adjectives and various
unknown elements. As the process is non-productive except for the use of Spanish
verbs, which are clearly not noun incorporation, these verbs have sin1ply been
called compound verbs, ignoring the various processes by which the compounds
may have been formed.","[176, 177]"
"
10.4             Relative cla11ses
In Awa Pit there are a number of constructions which fulfil the same se111antic
role as relative clauses in many languages, but only one or two of these construc-
tions truly fit the more common definitions of relative clauses, and even these
constructions have a number of somewhat unusual features. 15 Before turning to
an examination of these constructions, the various definitions of relative clauses
developed separately and together by Keenan and Comrie will be looked at.
        In their original paper, I(eenan and Comrie state that they consider any
syntactic object to be a relative clause            if it specifies a set of objects (perhaps a one-member set) in two
            steps: a larger set is specified, called the domain of relativization,
            and then restricted to some subset of which a certain sentence,
            the restricting sentence, is true. The domain of relativization is
            expressed in surface structure by the head NP, and the restricting
            sentence by the restr:icting clause, which may look more or less like
   15 See     also absolute clauses, section 10.3.7, which could be treated as 'adjoined relative
clauses ' .
    10.4.   RELATIVE CLAUSES                                                                 281
            a surface sentence depending on the language.
                                                     (I(eenan & Comrie 1977:63-64)            Comrie ( 1981: 136-137) modifies this definition slightly, and extends its
    use. He considers that his definition is ""a characterization of the prototypical
    relative clause, rather than a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the
    identification of relative clauses"", and notes that ""in order to say that a language
    has relative clauses, it should be the case that there is some construction or
    constructions correlating highly with the definition"":            A relative clause then consists necessarily of a head and a restricting
            clause. The head in itself has a certain potential range of referents ,
            but the restricting clause restricts this set by giving a proposition
            that must be true of the actual referents of the over-all construction.
                                                                    (Comrie 1981:136)    However he believes that English sentences such as non-finite constructions (pas-
    sengers leaving on flight 738 should .. . ) and those involving restrictive attributive
    adjectives ( the good students all passed the examination) are included in the
    definition of relative clauses.
            I(eenan ( 1985: 142) has essentially the same semantic definition as the other
    two works. However, the presence of a restrictive clause (SreI) is considered to be
    the defining feature of a relative clause. Under this definition,            there are structures we consider relative clauses which lack a do-
            main noun, in which case the domain of relativization is the class
            of objects of which it n1akes sense to assert the restrictive clause.
                                                                   (I(eenan 1985: 142)    While accepting these as relative clauses, I{eenan bases hi s classification on re-
    lative clauses which contain a domain noun, and has no further discussion of
    relative clauses without such a noun.
            In Awa Pit there are various constructions which fulfil at least some of
    the requirements for relative clauses. Three of these - the lexical nominaliz-
    ations, the deverbal adjectives and the purposive adjectives - lack so many
    clausal features and have such a variety of idiosyncratic restrictions that they are
    considered to be derivational processes, forming nouns or adjectives from verbs ,
    rather than being (relative) clauses, and hence these processes were discussed in
    sections 5.2.1, 5.2.3.1 and 5.2.3.2 respectively. There are also similarities between
    relative clauses and the agentive clausal nominalizations discussed in section 10.5 ,
    but, as will be explained there, there are sufficient differences to consider this con-
    struction as quite distinct from a relative clause.
            This leaves two constructions as relative clauses, one formed with the Pos-
    itive Adjectivizer m(u), the other with the Negative Adjectivizer 16 kayIJ, although
      16
        The Negative Adjectivizer is similar in function to the habitual negative in Epena Pedee ,
    discussed in Harms (1994:135-136).","[301, 302]"

Chapter 1Introduction1.1     I11troduction
Awa Pit is the traditional language of the Awa, an indigenous group who live
in the border regions of Colombia and Ecuador in South America, between the
Andes and the coast.
        Throughout this thesis, the indigenous group will be referred to as the
Awa (literally 'person' or ' people' ) and the language as Awa Pit ('people mouth '
or 'people language '), as these terms are becoming more popular for both outside
researchers and the Awa then1selves. \tVhile the simple label Awa is generally
sufficient , if those Awa who speak Awa Pit must distinguish thernselves from other
groups, they use the label inka.l awa ' mountain people'. A more ""traditional""
label (for outside research purposes) for both the group and the language is
Cuaiquer (Coaiquer, Cuayquer, I{waiker, I(wayquer , etc.), and indeed this label
appears to be the official designation of the group for the R evis ta Colombiana de
Antropolog{a ( Colombian Journal of Anthropology), though they allow Awa in
parentheses (Fernandez 1989- 90).
        The Awa themselves generally only consider Cuaiquer as part of a place-
name, the settlement of Cuaiquer Viejo. While it has sometimes been claimed
that this is the ""capital city"" of the Awa (Ortiz 1938:557) , Nuestra Senora de
Cuaiquer (1nodern Cuaiquer Viejo, built on the River Giiiza, forn1erly the River
Cuaiquer) was founded around the year 1600 by Garcia Tulcanaza, a cacique
('chief') of the Pasto group who worked for the Spanish (Aragon 1974:69).","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"

3.5.2     Subject
Awa Pit is a non1inati ve-accusati ve language, both morphologically and syn-
 actically: as will be shown in this section, NPs in A function and those in S
function act in the same \,vay, both morphologically and syntactically, and dif-
64                                     CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTURE
 fer from N Ps in o function. 9 It is thus possible to establish the grammatical
 relation of Subject, which covers all N Ps in A and S function and a number of
 others, since A and s have been defined restrictively. vVith the exception of
 zero-argument verbs, every verb in Awa Pit is subcategorized for a Subject.
         The morphological and syntactic tests given below are applicable to all N Ps
 in A function, and all N Ps in s function which are arguments of active verbs. 10
 Unfortunately, while the morphological tests used to show the identity of s and
A all work for active verbs ( though with minor differences in the case of nun1ber
marking), the majority of syntactic tests are not applicable for clauses involving
stative verbs - the stative verbs simply cannot be used in these constructions.
        The evidence for considering that arguments of stative verbs are Subjects
comes from three sources. The majority of stative verbs have, in fact, only one
argument, by definition s, and thus this argument is a Subject. This is not,
however, particularly convincing. Morphologically and syntactically, one of the
arguments of a stative verb acts in precisely the same fashion as an A or s of an
active verb - in tenns of constituent order, case marking, controlling number
marking ( with differences) and person marking. There is one syntactic test for
Subject which can be used with stative verbs, the same-Subject purposive.
        The gram1natical relation of Subject covers a variety of semantic roles,
such as volitional agent (ayna- 'cook'), non-volitional agent (kwata- 'von1it'),
patient (kwaa- 'drown', jiJJ- 'ripen'), experiencer (jzh- 'see') and possessor (mij
'have').","[84, 85]"

7.3.3     Plural 1narking as derivational
-~vVhile the situation is not at all clear, there are reasons for considering that the
marking of plural in the Awa. Pit of P ia.lapi n1ay be deri vational rather than
inflectional. The evidence is suggestive, but not conclusive.
         As an initial consideration, it should be noted that plural marking is closer
to the root than any other suffixes except deri vational suffixes. vVhile this is not
evidence in itself, it does mean that all ( other) inflectional morphology is ""outside""
plural marking , and hence plural n1arking could be derivational. In addition, in
the case of plural Subject marking of active verbs, the plural forn1s a portn1anteau
morpheme with one of the derivational suffixes, miz , the Incepti ve aspect marker.
         The plural marking is completely optional. vVhile it is not unknown for
inflectional morphology to be optional, it is n1uch more common for inflection to
be obligatory, and only derivational morphology to be optional.
         Perhaps most tellingly, plural n1arking may occur on certain non-finite verb
forms. Inflectional morphology in Awa Pit is not generally found on non-finite
forms, except for specific exceptions (such as ti or ma. found on the Perfective
Participle in the Resultative construction). However the plural n1arker may be
found on non-finite forms:(369)    izh-na-mtu                ka-s

186                       CHAPTER 7.       VERB INFLECTION AND NUMBER
Occurring as it does on non-finite forms, the plural marking appears more similar
to derivational n1.arking, which may occur in these circumstances. However there
are restrictions placed on the occurrence of plural marking in non-finite forms
which are not placed on (other) derivational suffixes. Plural marking only occurs
on non-finite verb forms which are main verbs and followed by a (finite) auxiliary
- unlike other derivational morphemes, plural marking may not occur on non-
finite verbs in subordinate clauses.
        Thus the evidence for the precise status of plural markers is unclear. Their
position in the verb, their optionality and their wider distribution than (other)
inflectional affixes suggest that they are derivational; but their range is somewhat
n1ore restricted than that of (other) derivational affixes.
Chapter 8Person marking8 .1      I11trodt1ctio11
As has been noted in a number of places, there is an unusual system of person
marking operating in Awa Pit. Person marking is important in examining the
issue of finiteness - person marking is never used on verbs in non-finite clauses
(whether main or subordinate), while verbs in finite clauses are generally person
marked. 1
        There are a few cases of finite clauses where person marking is not ex-
pressed through the usual systen1 - either it is simply unexpressed , or it is
shown inherently through some other marking.
        There is only one case where a finite clause does not express person. For
some reason, there is a ""clash"" between the Terminative aspect marker ti and
person marking, so while the Terminative aspect n1arker can be followed by a
Past or Future tense n1arker and then person , in the Present tense, which is
shown by the absence of P ast or Future n1arking, person cannot be expressed.
        As noted in section 3.3.2 , the Obligative and Potential moods a.re often
used to express ""universal"" ideas - 'someone n1ust do X / X must be done ' and
'someone can do X / X can be done' respectively. In these ""impersonal"" uses of
these moods, person marking is never expressed; but it can be used with the same
n1oods when a ""personal"" interpretation is intended (' I must do X ', ' Demetrio can
do X'). 2
        There is also a small group of verb inflections which have inherent person
marking: imperatives and hortatives (see section 9.4.5). The inflections indicat-
ing these moods have inherent person - first person for hortati ves and second
person for in1peratives . It is interesting to note that, by their very na.ture, clauses
containing these forms are ""outside"" the declarative/ interrogative split which is
of extren1e in1portance for the usual person-marking system.
   1
     0r at least one of the verbs is person marked , in the case of clauses involving the Serial
Verb or Conjoined Clause constructions - see sections 11.5 and 11.7.
   2
     This use of ""irnpersonal"" is not to be confused ,vith the in1personal (zero argun1ent) verbs ,
such as kin - 'to dawn' - these verbs do have person marking (in the usual contexts), despite
their inherent irnpersonal nature.
188                                              CHAPTER 8. PERSON MARI{ING
        In the remainder of this chapter the basic person-marking systen1 of Awa
Pit will be described. That is, non-declarative, non-interrogative clauses ( direct-
ives) will be left aside, as will ""impersonal"" uses of the Obligative and Potential
mood markers. It will be assumed that finite clauses involving the Tern1inative
aspect do carry person marking, and it is simply a peculiarity of the system that
in the Present tense this marking is not expressed. 3
        It is also important to note that the system being described is the ""reduced""
system of marking used in the region of Pialapi. That is, some varieties of Awa
Pit appear to have complex marking involving portmanteau person and number
1narking, but this system is not used in Pialapi (see section 7.3 for more details).
It should, however, be mentioned that from what little data is available the
Locutor / Non-locutor system (see below) appears to operate in the 1nore complex
person / nu1nber system also.
        The ren1ainder of this chapter is thus dedicated to the person-marking
syste1n of Awa Pit. It begins with a discussion of the Locutor / Non-locutor person
marking split; the full Past syste1n is explained, followed by the full non-Past
system; and finally a number of parallels with other languages and possible origins
for the system are discussed.
        In the following, a number of terms are used with somewhat unusual mean-
ings , more precise than co1nmon usage rather than distinct, and for reasons which
will become clearer below. First, a distinction is made between an entity being
' involved ' in an activity or state and an entity being a (gran1matical) ' participant'
in an activity or state. For exan1ple, alu ku- 'rain' is a zero-argun1ent verb in Awa
Pit: there are no participants (whether complements or adjuncts). However an
entity can be involved in an activity in which it is not a participant - if it rains,
it could affect me by raining on me, and I an1 then involved in this activity even
though (in Awa Pit) I cannot be a (grammatical) participant. This distinction
between participants and involved entities then leads to a distinction between
the notions of 'cross-referencing' and 'person 1narking'. Cross-referencing is some
marking of infonnation about participants on so1ne word or words other than
those denoting the participant entity (usually on verbs or auxiliaries). It is also
possible, however, to give some indication on, for example, a verb that an entity
is involved in an action. If this marking gives some information about the person
of an involved entity, then this marking can be considered person marking. If
information can only be given about the person of participants, then this person
marking is ( a subset of) cross-referencing. But it is also possible that person
marking could refer to non-participant involved entities, and consequently the
person marking is not cross-referencing. This distinction will be taken up again
in more detail after an examination of the person-marking system of Awa Pit.
   3 Infact, this assumption has no in1pact on the system, and it could just as easily be con-

      The complexity of the Awa Pit person-marking system is due in part to the
      interaction of two separate systems; or at least, two systems which appear to
~     be separate, although cross-linguistic comparisons suggest that the two may be
      interrelated. While each of these systen1s is not, of itself, con1plex, both are
      unusual, and the interaction of the two leads to an overall complex system which
     is bewildering, on the surface. This section deals with the Locutor / N on-locutor
r1
     distinction which is the major person-marking distinction in the system; the
     following two sections examine how this system interacts with semantic roles and
     grammatical relations to produce the system used to mark person in the Past
     tense and non-Past tenses.
              As is detailed in section 4.3.3, Awa Pit recognizes the ""usual"" three persons
     lexically, in its pronouns: first person na 'I', second person nu 'you' and third
     person us 'he, she', to give the singular Non1inative personal pronoun forms.
     These persons and correspondences to lexical pronouns are invariant - that is,
     a notional first person argu1nent can always be expressed through one of the first
     person pronouns, and so on, regardless of the type of utterance; of course the
     con1n1011 use of ellipsis in Awa Pit n1eans that the personal pronouns are not
     often used, except to indicate emphasis or to disambiguate utterances.
             The person-marking system, as expressed through verbal affixes, does not
     have this three-way division, but rather a binary division into Locutor and Non-
     locutor. These terms are perhaps not the most felicitous, but have been chosen
     as they are used in Vasquez de Ruiz's (1988) analysis of the related language
     Gua1nbiano; although it is, in fact, unclear from Vasquez de Ruiz's analysis
     whether the system in which the Guambiano Locutor and Non-locutor operate is
     the same as the Awa Pit system or not. 4 The terms ' Locutor' and ' Non-locutor '
     could perhaps be n1ore accurately replaced by 'item of interest is (or is not)
     episte1nic source for this type of utterance'; this is clearly not appropriate for
     glossing or easy reference, however.
             In discussion of a similar phenomenon in Tibetan languages, the terms
     'conjunct' ( corresponding to Locutor) and 'disjunct' (N on-locutor) have some-
     times been used, but these terms have been avoided for four reasons. Firstly,
     they refer only to the verb form, and are not used to refer to entites, which will
     be done below with Locutor and Non-locutor. Secondly, the terms were chosen
     by Hale (1980) for I(athmandu Newari because of the behaviour of these verb
     fonns in indirect speech subordinate clauses, and this is precisely where they
     differ from Awa Pit Locutor and Non-locutor, which never occur in such clauses.
     Thirdly, the most precise definition of a conjunct / disjunct system is that given
     by DeLancey (1992:57), and this definition includes features which are not found
     in the Awa Pit system. Finally, and perhaps most importantly in practical terms ,
        4
         V asquez de Ruiz (1988) only gives examples of Gua1nbiano person marking in statements ,
     where Locutor corresponds to first person, Non-locutor to second and third person. As she
     gives no exan1ples of questions, it is unclear whether the Locutor and Non-locutor in Guam-
     biano retains these correspondences of 1narking to person in questions , or undergo the same
     ""reassignment"" as in Awa Pit.
190                                              CHAPTER 8. PERSON NIARKING
' conjunct' has been used in the analysis of North American indigenous languages
to refer to a very different feature of verbs, found in Algonquian languages such
as Fox (see, for example, the use of 'conjunct' in Goddard (1996)).
        The Locutor/ Non-locutor distinction is, as is obvious fro1n its name, a
binary one. In statements, Locutor corresponds to first person, Non-locutor to
second and third person:(371)     (na==na)             pala ku-mtu-s

    4.3.4    Den1011strative pro11ou11s
    There are two demonstrative pronouns in Awa Pit, corresponding to the two
    demonstrative adjectives (see section 4.4.4): ana ' this' and suna 'that ' . These
    demons tr a ti ve pronouns cannot be n1odified.
            The demonstrative pronouns are distinguished from other nominals in that
    they cannot be followed by the Topic marker na. It would appear that, histor-
    ically, these pronouns may have developed from the demonstrative adjectives
    an 'this' and sun 'that' by the affixation of the Topic marker, and this would
    explain their inability to be used together with the Topic 1narker. However syn-
    chronically they are unitary lexical items, as can be seen fro1n two facts: ( 1)
    they have only a single n, while a co1nbination of the de1nonstrative adjective
    and the Topic 1narker should have two adjacent ns - ana 'this ( den1onstrative
    pronoun)' versus an==na 'this (den1onstrative adjective) == Topic n1arker \ and (2)
    the Accusati ve-n1arking postposi tion ta ( and other postpositions) occurs after
    the entire demonstrative pronoun, whereas when other Accusative nominals are
    topicalized, the Topic marker occurs after the Accusative n1arking:
    (85)    ana==ta
            this==ACC
            'this (Object)'    (86)    kuzhu==ta==na
            pig==ACC==TOP
            'pig (Object)'
            The demonstrative pronouns are also unique in that they may refer either
    to humans or non-humans. Other nominals are either inherently human or inher-
    ently non-human. When in Object position, if the demonstrative pronouns are
    referring to humans they will take Accusative marking; if referring to non-hun1ans
    they will appear without Accusative marking.",[108]

368                                      CHAPTER 14. DISCOURSE CLITICSIn the case of the first two, the original sentence asked was 'Demetrio's horse
has a long tail'; the last sentence was asked using the Spanish 'dative of affect'
construction.
       In these sentences, then, there is an initial, non-complement NP, marked
with the Topic marker na. This non-complement element is in some way involved
in the main predication (in all of the above sentences, as an owner of one of the
complements). In all cases this initial element was set off from the remainder
of the sentence by a pause, indicated with a co1nma above. This setting off of
the na marked element is identical to the use of the Topic marker with adjuncts,
discussed in the previous section, and the meaning developed to cover the usage
of na with adjuncts is, in fact, equally relevant here. This initial Topic-marked
element establishes a framework for the remainder of the predication: ""We're
discussing something to do with Demetrio's horse; the tail is long."" It is important
to note that in the first two sentences above, there is a second Topic-marked
element, mita, the tail, which is the actual ""about"" topic, and the Subject of the
predication.
       Awa Pit thus seems to have a ""double-subject"" construction. Few ex-
amples have been found of it, however this may be more related to the elicitation
technique than the nature of the language. In this construction, there is a main
predication, which may contain an explicit, Topic-marked, Subject, stating what
the predication is about; and there is an initial Topic-marked element, set off by
an intonation indicating that it is an adjunct, and establishes a framework within
which the following predication can be understood.
       The presence of an external topic constrution suggests, following Li &
Tho1npson's (1976) typology, that Awa Pit is at least in part a topic:-prominent
language, as ""all [topic-prominent] languages have sentences of this type, while
no pure [subject-prominent] languages do"" (Li & Thon1pson 1976:468). Various
other factors also suggest the topic-prominent nature of Awa Pit ( the lack of a
passive and dummy subjects, for exa1nple); however nominative-accusative case-
marking would tend to suggest a subject-prominent language. It would thus
appear that Awa Pit is a mixed topic-prominent and subject-prominent system,
although a great deal of further work would need to be done on the basicness or
otherwise of these constructions with external topics to establish this with any
certainty.","[390, 391]"

5.2     N 01111 pl1rases
The head of an NP is , naturally, a noun or pronoun , although under certain con-
ditions this head can be ellipsed (see 5.2.5). With the exception of the nominal
postmodifiers (see 4.3.6) , all other non1inals discussed in section 4.3 can be used
as the head of an NP: nouns , time and place nouns , personal pronouns, demon-
strative pronouns , and relational nouns ( although there are strong restrictions on
all of these except nouns) .
        As ·well as a noun or pronoun head , an NP has many other possi bili t-
ies. Awa Pit has a productive clausal nominalization strategy, discussed in sec-
tion 10.5; however certain nominalizations have diverged from this pattern, and
apparently been lexicalized (section 5.2.1). While there is no true reflexive con-
struction in Av,.ra Pit, the techniques used by Awa Pit to reflect the same meanings
are largely based on the selection of appropriate NPs (section 5.2.2) . Nominal
heads of NPs can, of course, be modified, and the strategies for modification are
discussed in section 5. 2. 3; one particular modification strategy, used for posses-
sion. has a wide range of functions, and these are examined in section 5.2.4.

4.3.1     Nou11s
The largest subclass of nominals are the nouns. These form an open subclass, with
1nany nouns having entered from Spanish, particularly nouns referring to cultural
objects previously not found in the Awa region. There is no specific defining
characteristic of all nouns to distinguish them from other nominals - they are
simply those nominals not categorized in any other subclass. They are discussed
4.3.   f\TONIINALS                                                                             s:3
 at greater length in section 5. 2. As in Imbabura Quechua ( Cole 1985: 129 ), but
 unlike 111any South An1erican languages, there are no noun classes and no nominal
 classification system in Awa Pit; nor is there a mass / count noun distinction.
         The semantic core of the nouns is, of course, concrete objects, whether hu-
111an (such as ampu 'man' and ashaIJpa 'woman'), anin1ate (such as ulam 'arma-
dillo' and kuzhu 'pig') or inanin1ate (such as uk 'stone ' and uskulam 'blowpipe ' ).
 Awa Pit , like Epena Pedee (Harms 1994:19), appears to have no abstract nouns.
Human nouns may be distinguished from the others by the presence of Accusative
marking with Obj ect NPs containing human nouns (see section 5.4.2), and their
ability to take the suffix tuzpa as a marker of Collective action (see section 5.2.6).
         Perhaps one section of the noun subclass which needs further discussion
is the area of kinship. I(inshi p relations between people are encoded via nouns in
Awa Pit, and the relation is shown in same way as possession (see section 5.2.4).
         The traditional kinship system of the Awa, based largely on sibling groups
(Osborn 197 4), appears to be breaking down in the region of the Resguardo de
Pialapi; and the traditional tern1inology would seem to be the first thing to go.
Several speakers had trouble recalling the traditional terms for various kinship
relations, and many Spanish terms are used, either to cover kinship relations
which perhaps did not exist for the traditional Awa (such as pitimu 'male cousin'
fro111 Spanish primo), or as one tern1 to cover a Spanish concept which was
previously divided into several different categories ( kunyata 'sister-in-law' from
Spanish cunada to cover both mamsha 'male's sister-in-law' and mayIJ ' fen1ale's
sister-in-law'). 1
         Several of the core kinship relations have two words, a formal and an
informal word . The informal word is always used to address one's own kin, and
also to talk a.bout one's own kin or the kin of those closely related to oneself,
while the formal terms are usually used to refer to someone else's kin. The
kinship terms which were collected are listed in Table 4.1; underlined terms may
have been borrowed from Spanish. It is also interesting to note that one of the
words for father, taytta, is sin1ilar to words in Quechua, I{amsa and Paez, and
is used in the Spanish of southern Colombia to refer to traditional leaders of
various indigenous groups. The terms for cousin , pitimu and pi-tima are also
used to mean 'general relative', that is, to refer to son1eone who is known to be
a rela.ti ve, but the precise relation is not known or does not have a cover tern1;
the ""politically aware"" Awa also use this term to refer to any Awa, or sometimes
even extend it to any indigenous person.","[103, 104]"

5.4.2         Ta: The Accusative marker
The postposi tion ta is used to indicate that the referential human noun phrase
it follows is acting in the grammatical relation of Object or Second Object. As
these grammatical relations are extensively discussed in section 3.5.3, the types
of verbs which take Object and Second Objects are discussed in sections 4.5.4
and 4.5.5, and exan1ples are given in section 3.6, no further comments will be
made here. 11
  11
       It is interesting to note that a case-marker ta is found in Inga Quechua (Levinsohn 1976:96),
1narking both accusative and a locative case.

        5.4.3    Ta: Locative/allative
       While Obando Ord611ez (1992:107) lists ta as an allative, as with pa and mal
       it is better considered as basically locative; it can be used to indicate direction
       towards, but also position at, and when suffixed with s, it is used for motion
       away from. As a locative, its primary use appears to be to indicate location in a
       container:        (212)   shi=ta==ma        comida kwin-ta-w?
                what==in == INTER food   give-PAST-LOCUT:SU BJ

       However it is also used for lo cation in a settlement or town; and is used with
       an interrogative as the standard n1ethod of asking the location of something or
       someone:        (214)   profesor==na min=ta    tu-y?

"5.2.4.6      Material-object
It is often necessary to state what 1naterial an obj ect is made from. In this case
the object is the head noun, and the material is a modifier. The 1naterial is, of
course, non-human, and hence a bare noun modifier is used. It does not matter
whether the object has been constructed by people or is naturally occurring:( 19 0)    k wal ti y al
           gual te house
           ' house n1ade fron1 gual te (local wood)'(191)      uk      tza
           stone ridge
           'stone ridge'5.2.4. 7    Specific-general
There is one further construction which appears to use a bare noun n1odifier,
which is the specific-generic construction. Unfortunately, little data is available
on this construction.
         While there do not appear to be any cases in Awa Pit where it is necessary
to use a specific-general construction, these constructions are sometimes used
with plants and animals. For example, kalputut 'mouse sp.' is a particular variety
of tunya 'mouse', and simply saying kalputut is sufficient to identify this animal
- but often it will be referred to as kalputut tunya. Likewise rather than wisha
'w hite person', speakers will often say wisha awa 'white:person person'.
         These constructions could perhaps be considered as a forn1 of noun clas-
sifier, a classification device which accompanies the noun regardless of the pres-
ence of modifiers . However noun classifiers are commonly used anaphorically
(Craig forthcoming), and there is no evidence of this in Awa Pit, nor is there
evidence of the system extending beyond animals and plants.
         In addition to the specific-general constructions, there are also similar
constructions involving types of trees. However with these constructions the
modifier has ""fused"" with the word ti 'tree' to form one word. Thus for example
130                  CHAPTER 5.       f\TPS, PPS AND COPULA COMPLEl\!fE1VTS
there is a particular variety of local tree called kwalti, and ba1nboo is called

,111
                    The position (almost) directly before a verb in a sentence in Awa Pit may be filled
                    by a manner adverbial - only the negative n1arker shi and the degree adverb pina
                    intervene between a rnanner adverbial and the verb. While n1anner adverbials
                    do, in some fashion, state something about the manner in which the verb was
                    carried out, this semantic idea is somewhat vague, and perhaps a better term
                    would be simply 'adverbial'. The term ' manner adverbial' is chosen to maintain
                    a terminological distinction between, for exan1ple, '1nanner adverbs' (otherwise
                    'adverbs'), 'tin1e adverbs' and ' degree adverbs'.
                            The manner adverbial slot can be filled by words from three distinct word
                    classes. Perhaps the most basic of words to fill this position are the manner
                    adverbs. It can also, however, be filled by an adjective (or degree adverb or
                    comparative marker plus adjective), provided that this is semantically reasonable.
                    There are also cases where this slot is filled by a noun, although it is unclear in
                    these cases whether this is a productive use of nouns as manner adverbials, or
                    whether these are lexically fixed compound verbs. The use of nouns as manner

adverbials will not be discussed here, then, but rather in section 4.5.6, dealing
specifically with compound verbs.
        While both manner adverbs and adjectives can fill the manner adverbial
position, these two word classes can be distinguished, in the same way in which it
is possible to distinguish ti1ne adverbs and nouns with te1nporal reference. While
adjectives can be used within a noun phrase to modify a noun as well as in the
manner adverbial slot to modify a verb, the manner adverbs can only be used in
manner adverbial position and cannot modify a noun within a noun phrase:(967)   wat      ampu

phrases also. The ten words which cannot occur within the noun phrase, and
hence are classed as manner adverbs, are listed in Table 4.12 in section 4.9. In
addition to the exa1nple of aza above, and examples of the interrogative n1anner
adverbs in sections 12.2.6 and 12.2.8, other examples of the use of 1nanner adverbs
are:(971)   na              impata==yI]          a-mtu-ata-w

"This marking is person marking, as it indicates something about the person
involved in the action or state (for example, 'on me' in the last sentence), but
is not cross-referencing, as it does not necessarily refer to any complement or
adjunct in the sentence. 13
       Only one of the four elements of the person-marking system does, in fact,
always cross-reference an argument. If the Locutor Subject marking appears,
then the gran1n1atical Subject of the clause is, necessarily, a Locutor argun1ent .
However the three other markers are not necessarily coreferential with any ar-
gument. The Locu tor Undergoer (in the Past system) and the Locu tor ( in the
non-Past system) can occur to indicate that there is an involved non-participant
entity; and the Non-locutor (in both systems) can occur with zero-argun1ent
  13 The idea of 'on me' in the sentence above cannot be represented through the use of a
con1plement or adjunct; it could be expressed through a circun1locution, such as 'it was shining ;
I got warm' or 'it was shining; I was working outside '.

      a ""default"" option or a ""dummy subject"", as is often done in analyzing verbs such
      as llueve 'rain-3sg' in Spanish, but this cannot account for the other cases , and
      will be avoided at this stage in favour of an analysis which accounts for all cases.","[225, 226]"
"       It is interesting to note this usage of the Imperfective as a scheduled fu-
ture. In their typological study of tense, aspect and 1nodality, Bybee, Perkins &
Pagliuca (1994 :249-251) discuss four morphemes with the meaning of expected
or scheduled future, and note that three of these are imperfectives with a present
or progressive use. As their examples involve Latin , Modern Greek and Baluchi ,
they wonder about the distribution of such a combination:         vVhether all the instances of this use of imperfectives are in Indo-
         European languages because they tend to enjoy more comprehens-
         ive descriptions than non-Indo-European languages is unclear.
                                      (Bybee, Perkins & Pagliuca 1994:251 )Thus it is cross-linguistically interesting to see this combination of meanings in
one morpheme in a non-Indo-European language.",[249]

12.2.3      Mi11== 'wl1ere, nowhere'
The third interrogative/ negative content word, min== 'where, nowhere', is a place
noun, and is obligatorily followed by a locative postposition. It can only be
followed directly by ta 'in' and pa 'in( approx)', not by mal 'LOC' nor ki 'at'. This
restriction on the following postpositions is presumably related to the semantics
of these postpositions.
        While min== 'where, nowhere' and min 'who, no-one' have the same form,
they are clearly distinct words. Min 'who, no-one' refers obligatorily to a human,
while min== 'where, nowhere' refers always to a place. There is a further homo-
phony within the interrogative/negative words, with min 'which', an adjective.
This third word is an adjective, rather than a pronoun like the other two, and it
may refer to either humans or non-humans. Hence while homophonous, and all
interrogative/ negative words, the three fonns can be distinguished both gram-
matically and semantically. It is likely, of course, that all three are diachronically
related.
        As noted above, min== 'where, nowhere' can only be followed directly by
ta or pa, in either their locative or allative meanings, or suffixed by s in their
elative use; other postpositions may follow ta or pa.(827)    min==ta==ma          tu-y?

"5.2.3.1        Deverbal adjectives
In addition to lexical adjectives , Awa Pit has two classes of derived adjectives, the
deverbal adjectives (discussed here) and the purposive adjectivizations (the fol-
lowing section). These adjectives , which are derived from verbs, retain some
   1
       As elsewhere , loans are indicated here in non-italic.
 120                   CHAPTER 5. NPS, PPS A[vD COPULA COMPLEMENTS
verbal features - in particular, rather than occurring before the noun they
modify, they follow it. The two constructions have not been found after a noun
which has 1nodifiers before it also.
       There are very strict semantic restrictions on the verbs which can be de-
verbalized: a deverbal adjective can only be formed from a verb which implies
a change of state and indicate the result of that change. Thus while a deverbal
adjective ii-ta 'dead' can be formed on the verb ii- 'die', there is no deverbal
adjective corresponding to az- 'cry', as this verb does not signal a change of
state.
       Deverbal adjectives can be formed on the basis of intransitive or transitive
verbs (there are no ditransitive verbs with appropriate meanings). The deverbal
adjective is formed through the use of the Perfective Participle suffix, and gives
the meaning that the noun with which it is associated has, at some time in the
past, undergone the change of state indicated by the verb.
       In the case of intransitive verbs, the deverbal adjective refers to the Subject
argument of the corresponding verb: ( 14 7)   wakata ii-ti-zi
           cattle die-PAST-NON LOCUT
           'The cow died.' (148)     wakata ii-ta
           cattle die-PFPART
           'a / the dead cow'With transitive verbs, the deverbal adjective is associated with the noun which
has undergone the change of state marked by the verb - and for transitive verbs,
the Object is the argument which undergoes any change of state: (149)     na==na              cam1sa pat-ta-w
           lSG.(NOM)==TOP shirt       wash-PAST-LOCUT:S u BJ
           ' I washed the shirt.'(150)      camisa pat-ta
           shirt  wash-PFPART
           'a / the clean shirt'        As can be seen from the above examples, there is a major difference
between the distribution of (lexical) adjectives and deverbal adjectives. Within
the NP , adjectives precede the noun which they modify; deverbal adjectives fol-
low the noun. In English it is reasonable to consider that passive participles used
as adjectives are indeed adjectives, derived at the level of the lexicon, since they
exhibit all the properties of adjectives (see Wasow 1977); however in Awa Pit the
deverbal adjectives are clearly quite separate from the lexical adjectives.
        Not only are deverbal adjectives different from adjectives in terms of their
position in the noun phrase, there is another difference between the two. Ad-
jectives in Awa Pit do not have complements; deverbal adjectives can ""bring
5.2.     NOUN PHRASES                                                                         121
with them"" any optional adjuncts (PPs) which the corresponding verb may have.
For example, the verb kutil- 'skin ' is a transitive verb, and can optionally be
accompanied by a PP indicating the method of skinning used: (151)    na==na                 iiv==kasa        kuzhu kutil-ta-w

          'I skinned a pig with fire.'","[140, 141, 142]"
"        Deverbal adjectives (and any associated PPs) clearly form a constitutent
together with the noun they modify, as a single noun phrase. Any marking
associated with the noun phrase - either the topic marker or a postposition
indicating case - occurs not on the noun itself, but after the deverbal adjective,
as in the preceding example and the following ones:(153)     [ sha.p         ayna-ta           ]==na kwa.shma.yIJ 1

8. 6     S 111n1nary
To sun1n1arize the Awa Pit person-111arking system: There is a distinction between
Locutor and Non-locutor throughout the system. This distinction is based on
episte111ic authority, with Locutor essentially corresponding to first person in
statements and second person in questions, while Non-locutor covers first person
in questions, second person in statements, and all third person. Following the
Past tense 111arker there are three person 111arkers. Locutor Subject shows that
a Locutor element is the grammatical Subject of a verb; Locutor U ndergoer
shows that the action or state expressed by the verb affected a Locutor entity,
whether this entity was directly involved in the action or state or more indirectly
affected; and Non-locutor marking states that no Locutor element was involved
or affected. Where person marking appears but no Past tense marker, there are
only two person markers available: Locutor, which corresponds to both Locutor
Subject and Locutor Undergoer in the Past system; and Non-locutor, identical
to the Non-locutor marking in the Past system.
        Both unusual elements of this syste111, the Locutor / Non-locutor split and
the unusual distribution of markers with the focus always on a Locutor entity
regardless of its grammatical function or semantic role, can be hypothesized as
having developed simply and directly from an experiential evidential system. If
this system involved sentence-final particles, the use of person marking on both
verbs and some non-verb sentence-final elements could be explained. However
the Awa Pit system is no longer an evidential system, but has rather changed into
  2 2 See Dixon (1994:99) or Hopper & Thompson (1980)   for ideas along these lines.
8.6.   SU!VIMARY                                                                   217a true person-marking system, although it is still not , strictly speaking, a cross-
referencing system. Together with this change from an evidential system towards
a cross-referencing system has come an alternation in marking. As the systen1
has n1oved towards a cross-referencing system, the idea of alignment has become
relevant, and the person-marking system has the option of marking non-agentive
intransitive verbs as it did under the evidential system (producing an alignment
pat tern of spli t-ergati vi ty) or as they would be marked in a nominative/ accusative
system, the same alignment system as the case-marking.

12.2.1      Mi11 'who, no-one'
The word min 'who, no-one' is used to question or negate a human noun con-
stituent of a sentence. The form min is used in the Nominative, and as the base
before most postpositions to form most other case-forms, such as min==pa 'whose,
no-one's', min=kasa ' with whom, with no-one'. However there is a special suffix

   4 It is unclear whether a locative form min==ta exists or not. When used as a translation
of, for example, ""to whom did the child go?"", it was always translated back as ""where did the
child go?"", using min== 'where' rather than min 'who'. The Accusative form min-a was not
acceptable in this co ntext .

         One pair related through ta and one pair related through na do not have

The non-productive suffixes discussed in the previous section appear to have been
in origin a morphological causative marker. They are only found on verbs, the
result is a verb, and the usual additional causative meaning is accompanied by a
change in valency.
         There is a second group of non-productive derivations, in some ways sim-
ilar to the previous group, but distinct from it. These ""derivations"" involve the
""s uffixes"" a.p, pizh , pyan and kul. In fact , this second group is a very heterogen-
eous one, covering those pairs of words which are single words ( unlike the forms
discussed in the following section), but not related through a causative meaning
and the suffixes a, ta or na. The suffixes ap and kul have only been found in
these words, while pizh and pyan are also found as verb roots, meaning 'grasp'
and 'hit' respectively, and these meanings appear related to their use as ""deri v-
ational"" morphemes. All these ""suffixes"" can be attached to phonetic sequences

    This correspondence of grammatical relations is identical to that of non-causative-causative
pairs using the productive causative ; see section 6 .4. 1 for further details.

       As these words are all, syn chronically, single i terns, and all four ""suffixes""
are non-productive, it is perhaps simplest just to list the various forn1s, which
has been done in Table 6.2. It is worth noting that azh, found in azhpyan- and
azhpizh-, has not been found as a separate word, although it seen1s likely that
diachronically it was a verb meaning so1nething similar to ' open' or 'apart'.","[171, 172, 173]"
