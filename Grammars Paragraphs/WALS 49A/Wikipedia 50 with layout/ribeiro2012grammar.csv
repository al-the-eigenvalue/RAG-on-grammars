"       Chapter 4 deals with complex sentences. Subordinate clauses in Karajá are always theresult of sentential nominalizations, not only in the cases of relative and complement clauses,but of adverbial clauses as well. It is here claimed that adverbs in Karajá do not exist as anindependent part-of-speech (or, at least, constitute a marginal part-of-speech with very fewmembers), adverbial functions being played by postpositional phrases. Consequently,adverbial clauses are postpositional clauses, marked by the same postpositions which marknouns. Their use as subordination markers mirrors their use with nouns, even in the case ofconverbs—by far, the most common type of subordinate clauses--, which are marked by alocative postposition. Considering the role they play with adverbial clauses, postpositions aredescribed in this chapter. A case of discourse (rather than grammatical) subordination, the=dokuri clause, will also be described in this chapter.",[82]
"3.1 Personal pronouns       There are three independent personal pronouns in Karajá: ♀ dIkar´) (♂ dIar´)) ‘I’, kai
‘you’, and Î´kI (♂ ÎII) ‘he, she, it’. All of them can be pluralized by the pluralizer boho,
which also occurs with nouns. The plural form of the 1st person pronoun has an exclusivereading (51). For an inclusive 1st person plural reading, the noun id´) ‘human, Karajá’ is usedwith the pluralizer boho. The verb, in such cases, is generally inflected for third person,

       A common characteristic of lowland South American languages is the existence, withnouns, of different degrees of grammatical possession: there are obligatorily-possessed nouns(e.g. body-part terms, for instance), optionally-possessed nouns (e.g cultural items), andnouns which cannot be directly possessed (e.g. items of nature, such as rocks, water, animals,etc.). That is a well-documented phenomenon in several Macro-Jê languages, includingthose of the Boróro, Jê, and Karirí families (Rodrigues 1999:190-192). In the latter case (thatis, items which cannot be directly possessed), generic nouns such as the ones described aboveare used as possessive classifiers in indirect possessive constructions, such as 43 below, fromBoróro (Crowell 1977:178). In Karajá, however, that is not the case, as any noun can inprinciple be directly possessed (wa-idZOrOTa ‘my dog’, etc.).(43)   a.      i-n-ago      kogariga
               1-REL-pet    chicken

               ‘my stone’
       Corresponding to possessive verbs such as English have, Karajá presents aconstruction involving the instrumental postposition èdI attached to the indefinite pronounidZo) ‘some, other’ (44a) or to the possessed noun (44b):(44)   a.      ♂       dIar´)        wa-d¸)eru       idZo)è

                       ‘I have money.’
       b.      ♂       dIar´)              )eruè

                            ‘I have money.’
         While the instrumental postposition is intrinsically unstressed, it is always stressed inconstructions such as the ones above. That is probably another instance of the use of stressshift with subordinating functions (see Chapter 5). This is further illustrated below by aminimal pair (for stress) showing the contrast between the uses of èdI as a postposition (45a)and its use as a possessive predicator (45b):(45)     a.       i-d¸)eruèdI                 [inie""rudI]

Person agreementmarkers are distributed into two different sets, one occurring in the realis (present and pasttenses) and the other in the irrealis (future, potential, and admonitory). These prefixes arelisted in Table 12 below.15
15
   The same set of prefixes is used for singular and plural. There is also a distinction between a first person
plural exclusive (marked by the same set of prefixes used for first person singular) and a first person plural
inclusive (inflected for third person). The prefix k´- ‘3rd person’ is restricted to the centripetal direction of the
irrealis mood.","[54, 55, 56, 57]"
"2.3.2.3.          Antipassive         Antipassive is a phenomenon typical of ergative languages, correspondingfunctionally to a ‘mirror image’ of the passive construction in nominative-accusativelanguages (Silverstein 1976). In a syntactically ergative language, “while the A and the O inan ergative clause are marked as ergative and absolutive respectively, the A in an antipassiveis typically coded as an absolutive NP, and the O (if present) appears in a case other than theabsolutive” (Cooreman 1994, 50).39 Although some authors, such as Cooreman, limit thediscussion of antipassive constructions to ergative languages, nominative-accusative39
   I will follow Cooreman in adopting Dixon’s (1979) use of the labels A and O to refer to the two participants in
a two-participant clause—prototypically, the agent and the patient, respectively.",[206]
"       The use of directional inflection to signal empathy relationships between participantsof the speech act is particularly clear with non-motion verbs, for which both centrifugal andcentripetal marking options are available without great semantic constraints. In such cases,the use of a centripetal marker seems to imply that the speaker is somewhat more involvedwith the process described by the verb. That is why centripetal marking seems to bepreferred in situations where advice is being given, such as in the constructions (12) and (13)below, marked by the admonitory particle èhEd´). On the other hand, the use of centrifugalmarking in such constructions would fail to convey the concern of the speaker with the fateof the addressee.(12)   kOwOrUkO        makOwOn´)kEkI                  b´dETEhEn´)

       2-CTPT-INTR-die=ADM
       ‘[Be careful,] you may die!’
       Furthermore, in imperative constructions, marked by the potential particle èkE, theuse of centripetal markers seems to convey a higher degree of camaraderie (14b, 15b), whilethe use of centrifugal marking would suggest a more distant relationship (14a, 15a).(14)   a.      idZ´kÈ wakoku             bEl´kÈkE

       In narrative texts, especially those narrated mostly in 3rd person, directional inflectionis frequently used to signal which character the speaker chooses to be more relevant for thestory, by assigning to him or her the role of deictic center. This function of the directionalmarkers in Karajá is similar to the role played by obviation systems, such as the oneoccurring in Algonquian languages. In these languages, according to Dahlstrom (1999:36),“if more than one third person is mentioned within a certain syntactic domain, then the thirdperson most central to the discourse is referred to by proximate forms (of nouns, pronouns, orverb agreement) and the more peripheral third persons are referred to by obviative forms.”","[192, 193]"

  Both the allative postposition èkO and the dative postposition èd´kE mark the recipient or the direction of a
given process. Although both can occur with nouns, èd´kE seems to occur only with [+animate] nouns, while
èkO can occur with both [+animate] and [-animate] nouns. Because of this semantic constraint, èd´kE occurs
more frequently in functions that are traditionally associated with that of datives. As mentioned above, kO does
not take prefixes. Thus, corresponding to both postpositions, there is only one set of inflected forms: wa-d´kE
‘to me’, a)-d´kE ‘to you’, Îab´) ‘to him’, iTi-d´kE ‘to himself’.",[235]
"       Predicative and attributive adjectives are among the lesser known aspects of Macro-Jêlanguages. According to the descriptions available, in all Macro-Jê languages the ‘adjective’would follow the noun (Rodrigues 1999: 193). Since most Macro-Jê languages are SOV, theposition of the adjective in these languages would constitute a systematic counter-example toGreenberg’s implicational universals, according to which adjectives would tend to precedethe modified noun in SOV languages (Greenberg 1966). However, since most suchdescriptions do not give clear evidence for the existence of adjectives as an independent partof speech, the apparently exceptional nature of adjectives in Macro-Jê may well be justanother undesirable result of what one might call ‘translation-based linguistic analysis.’       That is certainly the case of Karajá, also traditionally described as having postposedadjectives (Maia 1998: 32). However, a careful analysis of the Karajá data clearlydemonstrates that words denoting adjectival meanings in this language are abstract nounswhose behavior is identical to that of obligatorily possessed nouns—i.e., corresponding toattributive constructions such as the angry man, Karajá presents a genitive construction, theman’s anger. This implies that, instead of occurring as a modifier, the “adjectival” wordwould be, in fact, the head of the noun phrase, a phenomenon documented in languages suchas Aleut (Sadock 2000), but commonly overlooked when considering Lowland SouthAmerican languages.",[224]
"        The evitative postposition indicates what is to be avoided or feared, marking theoblique complements of verbs such as -UbErU ‘to be freightened’ (4) and wO ‘to hide’.3 Anexample of the temporal postposition (‘when’) is given in (5) below. Besides indicatingsource (‘from’), the ablative postposition marks objects of comparison (6).(4)     ♂        wa-riOrE       Îorièèlau       ∅-r-∅-UbErUèr-ErI

                 ‘My child is afraid of the White man.’
2
  A good example of the problem posed by the translation of adpositions is the preposition by in English, which
has instrumental (he went by train), locative (he is by the fountain), and temporal (I’ll be back by midnight)
uses, among others. The criteria to determine the ‘basic’ meaning of postpositions may be fairly arbitrary. In
labeling the Karajá pospositions, I took into consideration what seems to be their more general, productive, and
non-idiomatic uses (as far as possible).
3
  Kariri, a Macro-Jê language remotely related to Karajá, also has an evitative postposition (Mamiani 1877:77).
According to Blake (1994: 156), evitative (also called ‘aversive’) case markers are also common in Australian
languages.",[236]

                          ‘I will go.’                         ‘I will come.’
        The system of directional markers in Karajá presents characteristics that traditionallydefine an inflectional category, such as obligatoriness, semantic and formal regularity, andproductivity (Anderson 1985:163; Bauer 1988:73-87; Bybee 1985:11). The existence ofdirection as an inflectional category seems to be a fairly rare phenomenon. Talmy(1985:135), for example, in a survey of grammatical categories, states categorically thatdirection “is not marked inflectionally.” According to Bybee, this would be due to its lack oflexical generality:      By definition, an inflectional category must be applicable to all stems of the appropriate semantic
      and syntactic category and must obligatorily occur in the appropriate syntactic context. In order
      for a morphological process to be so general, it must have only minimal semantic content. If a
      semantic element has high content, i.e. is very specific, it simply will not be applicable to a large
      number of stems. [Bybee 1985:16-17]
      That is, since the category of direction would in principle be relevant only for motionverbs, it would not apply to a sufficient number of verbs to constitute an inflectionalcategory. Thus, besides being commonly expressed lexically such as in Portuguese levar ‘totake away’ versus trazer ‘to bring’ and English come versus go, and by clitics, direction isalso found expressed derivationally, such as in Latin eo¤ ‘I go’, ex-eo¤ ‘I go out’, trans-eo¤ ‘I goacross.’ However, as Bybee (op. cit., 17) observes, “each of these prefixes has a limited                                                      175
lexical applicability, for they are only appropriately added to verbs indicating motion of somesort. Their semantic content prevents them from meeting one of the criteria for inflectionalstatus.”","[185, 186, 187]"

                                          Morphology1. Introduction
         This chapter describes Karajá’s word-formation strategies, including, in addition tomorphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles andclitics. Most of the chapter will be devoted to verb morphology, which is where most ofKarajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verb inflects for person (with portmanteaumorphemes which also indicate mood), direction (which also play evidential functions), andvoice (transitive, passive, and antipassive), besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns(sometimes with classificatory purposes). Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics andparticles, respectively. As in many other lowland South American languages, nouns,postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs share person-marking paradigms. Sincepostpositions have already been described in Chapter 1, and their semantic and syntacticcharacteristics will be further discussed in Chapter 5, they will not be dealt with in thischapter. Section 2 describes the inflectional properties of verbs. Section 3 deals with theinflectional properties of nouns and briefly discusses the small class of personal pronouns,outlining their main differences in relation to nouns. Section 4 discusses derivationalmorphology, describing processes used to create new noun (Section 4.1) and verb (4.2)stems.","[182, 183]"

       In most languages where there are distinctions such as the ones between i-class stemsand Î-class stems, postpositions are also divided between both classes. That may also havebeen the case in Karajá. Notice that all suppletive third-person forms begin with /Î/,suggesting that such ‘pronouns’ are relics of Î-class postpositional paradigms. Notice alsothat, if this theory is correct, a second-person form corresponding to ÎU would have been*∅-U; that may be the origin of the second-person prefix U- mentioned above.","[72, 73]"

8.3.5.2.3         Antipassive         Antipassive is a phenomenon typical of ergative languages, correspondingfunctionally to a ‘mirror image’ of the passive construction in nominative-accusativelanguages (Silverstein 1976). In a syntactically ergative language, “while the A and the O inan ergative clause are marked as ergative and absolutive respectively, the A in an antipassiveis typically coded as an absolutive NP, and the O (if present) appears in a case other than theabsolutive” (Cooreman 1994: 50).17 Although some authors, such as Cooreman, limit thediscussion of antipassive constructions to ergative languages, nominative-accusativelanguages may also present backgrounding antipassives, which “function to demote theundergoer to peripheral status” (Foley and Van Valin 1985: 338). This is what occurs inKarajá, where antipassive, marked by the prefix O-, results in the deletion of an unknown orirrelevant direct object:(59)     d-a)dI        ∅-r-O-TUhOèrErI

         As these examples show, antipassive in Karajá is not promotional (or foregrounding),in the sense that the A remains in the same syntactic relation it occupies in the correspondingactive, transitive voice. Furthermore, the antipassive construction in Karajá does not allow17

  Although the range of meanings displayed by some of the Karajá pospositions may at first seem unusual, it is
very easy to find parallels in other, well-known languages such as English or Portuguese. The use of locative
postpositions with temporal purposes (as a metaphorical extension from location in space to location in time),

                  ‘My friends call me Kawina.’for example, is a rather common phenomenon. Even more idiosyncratic uses of postpositions (as non-canonical
markers of what would be translated as direct objects in English) may also reflect cross-linguistic tendencies.
As Jespersen (1965:159) points out, verbs for ‘to throw’ take objects marked as instrumentals in many
languages, including Old Norse. The use of a locative posposition to mark the object of a verb such as ♀ rakuSi
‘to eat’ (♂ roSi) is paralleled in English by the use of on in constructions such as deer feed on grass or the
castaway lived on coconuts for weeks.

  This apparent diversity of meanings could be due not to polysemy, but to homophony (that is, instead of these
being instances of different meanings associated with a single postposition, it could be the case that there would
be different postpositions with the same phonological shape). However, the fact that a postposition such as èb´)
presents the same irregular allomorphy in all the uses mentioned above seems to rule out the hypothesis of
accidental similarity.","[236, 237, 238]"

          Subject and direct objects are the positions which tend to be more easily relativizablecross-linguistically, when compared with other syntactic positions. The hierarchy of whichpositions are more likely to allow relativization is thus summarized by Keenan and Comrie(1977):(36)      Keenan and Comrie’s (1977) Accessibility Hierarchy:
          Subject > Direct Object > Indirect Object > Object of Adposition > Possessor
          While subject and direct object relativized positions are not marked in Karajá,relativized positions occupying a lower position in the accessibility hierarchy are marked bya third-person pronominal form. That is, relativization of any syntactic position besidessubject and direct object is accomplished through pronoun retaining strategies. This is thecase for objects of all the postpositions (including the dative, which behaves as any otheroblique NP in the language, and objects of comparison), as well as possessors.

3.3 Possible origins of the ‘subordinating accent’       As we have seen, stress shift plays an important role in subordination in Karajá. Thisdevice—which we may call ‘subordinating accent’—is reminiscent of the ‘definite accent’ inTonga, described by Anderson (1992: 212) as an example of non-affixal clitic. In thislanguage, according to Anderson, “the normal location of stress is on (the syllablecontaining) the penultimate mora. A sort of definiteness is marked by a stress shift to thefinal mora of the entire NP.” In this case, the stress shift is explained as being the reflex of ademonstrative morpheme *a which would have existed diachronically.","[246, 247, 248]"
"        The case of Karajá (as well as a brief observation of other languages of the stock)suggests that one must be cautious in analyzing descriptive predicates as verbs in Macro-Jê
                                                 212
languages. In cases in which there are clear criteria to distinguish nouns and verbs,descriptive predicates tend to behave mostly like nouns. For example, in Karajá a verb mustfirst be nominalized in order to appear in a descriptive predicate. Consequently, one mustalso be cautious in relying on the behavior of descriptive predicates as a sole criterion topropose active-stative systems.","[223, 224]"
"       Chapter 3 describes the language’s word-formation strategies, including, in additionto morphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles andclitics. Verb morphology is where most of Karajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verbinflects for person (with portmanteau morphemes which also indicate mood), direction(which also play evidential functions), and voice (transitive, passive, and antipassive),besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns (sometimes with classificatory purposes).",[81]
"A case in point is the noun b´dE ‘time, ground, world’, which occurs in a number ofidiomatic expressions as an ‘empty’ object (b´dE + rÈrÈ ‘remember’ > ‘to become sad’; b´dE+ buka ‘disagree; not fit’ > ‘to be unlucky, when fishing, hunting, etc.’; b´dE + kErÈ ‘toknow’ > ‘to realize’). This word also occurs in non-idiomatic constructions, as the subject of‘atmospheric’ verbs (‘to cool down’, ‘to become silent’, ‘to become dark’, etc.) or as anobject. In its more idiomatic uses, b´dE can cliticize to the verb or even be incorporated intoit; as the examples below demonstrate, vowel harmony triggered by the first vowel in theverb root buka extends all the way to the object b´dE (78). Vowel harmony between the verband its object is further illustrated by (79), a curse, where the clitic èr-e ‘imperfective’triggers vowel harmony throughout the verb, reaching the object ruE ‘eye’.(78)   a.      waha            b´dE    ∅-r-I-bukaèra [b´deribu""kara]

6.1.3 Vowel harmony and grammatical function           As metaphony in Portuguese (which serves to distinguish nouns from verbs, andsecondarily reinforces gender and number distinctions), vowel harmony in Karajá (or its lackthereof) may play a role in grammatical distinctions. Although a finite verb in Karajágenerally ends with an aspectual-modal clitic, such a clitic may be suppressed in casualspeech. As we have seen, two of the aspectual-modal clitics, èkre ‘future’ and èr-e‘imperfective’, can trigger vowel harmony. The latter, by far the most frequent aspectual-modal clitic, can be suppressed while still triggering vowel harmony (80)—a case ofassimilation in absentia, as I mentioned elsewhere (Ribeiro 2005:103). Vowel harmony maybe, in such cases, the sole mark of aspect. On the other hand, the lack of vowel harmony is,to a certain extent, a mark of aspect as well, in examples such as (81) and (82) below; the factthat such examples do not display vowel harmony is in itself an indication, by exclusion, thatsuch verbs are not imperfective (marked by the harmony-triggering clitic èr-e) or future(marked by èkre).(80)       bEraètSi      ∅-r-E-TEè∅        [re""Te]

"5. Language contact and the ‘Xavánte hypothesis’         The development of male and female speech distinctions such as the ones occurringin Karajá may, in several cases, be the result of situations of language contact.24 Theclassical example of such a situation occurs in the so-called Island-Carib language (Arawak),mentioned as early as the 17th century. According to Jespersen (1964:237), “[T]he first tomention their distinct sex dialects was the Dominican Breton, who, in his Dictionnaire
24
  Although phenomena such as pronoun borrowing and male vs. female speech distinctions are generally
discussed in reference to ‘exotic’ languages, both can be illustrated by a case of borrowing in Portuguese. In
[Brazilian] Portuguese, French moi is commonly used informally, mainly in a sort of tongue-in-cheek register.
My impression as a native speaker (corroborated by internet searches and consultations with other native
speakers) is that such usage of moi is essentially restricted to female speech, illustrating how males and females
may be more or less receptive to language innovations.",[170]
"         Another possible origin would be a more general, delimiting use of stress (common inlanguages where stress is predictable), to mark the boundaries of the noun phrase. However,given the lack of comparative evidence, one can only speculate on the origins of suchphenomenon.133.4 Previous descriptions         In spite of its extreme pervasiveness, the phenomenon of the ‘subordinating accent’was not mentioned in previous accounts of Karajá grammar (Fortune & Fortune 1964,Fortune 1970, Fortune 1973, Maia 1998). In his typological study, Maia states that he wasable to find “hypothetical relative constructions” only through direct elicitation, “similarstructures not being detected in the texts analyzed” (Maia 1998:33).14 The “hypothetical”here relates to the fact that he could not identify any relative pronoun (or any subordinatingmorpheme, for that matter) in the constructions considered. Notwithstanding this, theexamples of “hypothetical relative constructions” that he provides (reproduced below with12
   This ‘subordinating’ morpheme could have been a nominal clitic, such as an article (which would thus pair
with the indefinite article ♀ èdo)).
13
   Sinchronically, one could postulate the existence of a ‘zero clitic’ to account for the stress shift. Since this
more abstract analysis does not necessarily present any analytical advantage, I will adopt a more concrete
analysis in this paper, indicating the stress shift whenever necessary.
14
   Although Maia’s statement seems to suggest that relative clauses are less common in texts than in elicited
materials, that is certainly not the case. Most examples in this paper were indeed taken from texts, where
subordination is extremely common. In fact, all the subordinate clause types here described are highly favored
constructions in Karajá grammar.",[249]

       The only property that descriptives share with verbs is the fact that both can occur aspredicates and, therefore, appear with tense/aspect markers. As we have seen, these markershave been traditionally considered inflectional affixes. According to this view, any lexeme
                                              214
occurring with these ‘affixes’ would be by definition a verb. However, a more carefulanalysis has shown that the tense/aspect markers are, in fact, clitics, and can therefore attachto any element occurring as predicate, including postpositional phrases, pronouns, and nouns(Ribeiro 1996). As such, they can attach to any element occurring as a predicate, includingpostpositional phrases (61), pronouns (62), and nouns (63).(61)   waÎau          Î´b´)raèkuèr-e

       Claiming that descriptives are, in fact, nouns, does not imply that they are alwaysoriginally nouns. Indeed, a number of descriptives are derived from change-of-state verbs,such as itS´)ÎE ‘to become crazy’ (66), EbUrE ‘to get angry’ (67), and -uÎǨÎǨ ‘to become

       Notice that the basic meaning of these verbs is not descriptive or stative, butprocessual: they denote the inchoative aspect of what in other languages such as English
                                              216
would correspond to an adjective. Other descriptives, such as kutSiE ‘heavy’, are originallynouns (69).(69)   a.      wa-bEhÈra     ∅-r-a-kutSiE-d´)èr-e

       As we have seen, ‘descriptives’ behave morphologically as nouns. I propose thatdescriptives derived from verbs, such as in (66)-(68) above, are also nouns. Although this isnot obvious in the examples above, since the primitive verbs and their noun forms happen tobe homonymous, it becomes clear with verbs that are formally differentiated from theirderived nouns. Such is the case with verbs such as Oka ‘to make holes’, kÈka ‘to tear’, andUk´) ‘to dry’, whose corresponding noun forms are derived by consonantal replacement (aswe have seen, a common mechanism to derive nouns from verbs):(70)   a.      wa-bE-d-EkO           ∅-r-∅-Oka=r-a

        Descriptives derived from verbs are generally translated as participles—that is, verbaladjectives. Notwithstanding this, I consider them to be verbal nouns, which is a corollary ofthe lack of distinction between nouns and adjectives in Karajá. As Haspelmath (1994, 152)states, “it is quite clear that not all languages have participles. The definition of participle(‘verb-derived adjective within a verbal paradigm’) apparently presupposes the existence ofadjectives in a language. Since there are many languages that lack primary adjectives, atleast these languages will also lack participles.”","[225, 226, 227, 228, 229]"
"Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics and particles, respectively. As in many otherlowland South American languages, nouns, postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs shareperson-marking paradigms. Comparative evidence plays an important role in explainingless-than-transparent morphological devices, such as linking prefixes (which, as it turns out,are cognates with similar prefixes in other Macro-Jê languages), synchronically invariableroots with fossilized prefixes, and a non-concatenative mechanism to derive nouns from
                                               70
verbs. The latter constitute an unusual case of replacive infixation, which, thanks tocomparative evidence, can be traced back to the affixation of a nominalizing suffix.","[81, 82]"

6. Dokuri-clause        Besides the ‘postpositional clauses’ described in this chapter, a few otherconstructions can also be probably treated as functional equivalents of adverbial clauses. Themost common among them is the dokuri-clause, characterized by the presence of the second-position clitic ♀ èdokuri (♂ èdori). Such clauses have an explicative function and can be
translated using English for (80) or because.(80)    ♂       ÎiOèhE          b-∅-∅-Ud´),

        Maia (2002:155) analyzes ♂ èdori as a ‘focus marker,’ which is probably a mistake:
being a second-position clitic, it is not surprising that this morpheme occurs after frontedelements, but that is also the case of most discourse-oriented particles in the language (seeChapter 4). Fortune (1970) translates it (rightly, I think) as ‘because.’ As a second-positionclitic, èdokuri attaches to the first constituent of the clause, regardless of its syntactic status.","[265, 266]"
"8.3 Morphosyntax       Karajá is an SOV, head-marking language. Core NP arguments—that is, subject anddirect object—are not morphologically marked. Pronominal subjects are expressed by aseries of free pronouns, such as ♀ dIkar´) ‘I’ in (28) below, while pronominal objects are
                                                37
expressed by a series of bound morphemes, such as wa- ‘1st person’ in (29). In contrast to afairly simple nominal morphology, Karajá presents a complex verb morphology, beingtraditionally described as having a very irregular fused set of prefixes indicating person,aspect, object, and direction (Fortune & Fortune 1964, Wiesemann 1986, Maia 1998).","[48, 49]"

   The use of destination adpositions to mark purpose clauses is commonly attested, as in English (I came to see
you) and Portuguese (eu vim para vê-lo).
21
   Notice that the future and potential markers are also optional in verbal imperatives.",[255]

       These tense and aspect markers have traditionally been considered as inflectionalaffixes (Fortune & Fortune 1964, Fortune 1973; Maia 1998). However, a more recentanalysis has shown that they are, in fact, clitics (Ribeiro 1996). As such, they can attach toany element occurring as a predicate, including postpositional phrases (66), pronouns (67),and nouns (68):(66)   ♂       waÎau          Î´b´)raèuèr-e

       Auxiliaries and particles belong to clearly-distinct grammatical categories, based onsemantic, morphological, and distributional criteria. Semantically, particles are moreproperly described as modals (future, potential), while auxiliaries are more properlydescribed as aspectual markers (progressive, perfective, imperfective). Morphologically,particles are invariable, while auxiliaries are inflected, forming a defective sub-class of verbs.","[69, 70]"

       In addition to the paradigmatic peculiarities and wide range of semantic uses, the‘diffuse locative’ postposition, èb´), presents some distributional peculiarities. As illustratedby (16) below, in which èb´) occurs as a purpose marker, it can follow other postpositions (inthis case, the ‘static locative’ èkI). [The example also illustrates the use of the dativepostposition, èd´kE ~ èdEE, with benefactive functions.](16)   wa-dEE              kIè

       ‘Watch out for me!’ (lit. ‘[It is] for [it to be] in your eyes for me.’)       Another characteristic which sets èb´) apart from all the remaining postpositions is itsposition with relation to the contrastive morpheme èle ‘only’: while èle follows all the otherpostpositions, as illustrated below by the dative èd´kE (17a), it precedes èb´) (17b):(17)   a.              kEè

2.1 Extended intransitive verbs       A number of verbs which would be translated as transitives in English or Portuguesehave objects marked by oblique postpositions in Karajá. For example, the verb -obi ‘to see’takes objects marked by the locative postposition èb´) (18); -ehu ‘to throw’ takes
                                                228
complements marked by the instrumental postposition èdI (19); -aha ‘to find’ takescomplements marked by the locative postpositions ètSi or èkI (20).7 The verb ♀ rakuSi ‘to
eat’ (♂ roSi), although marked by the prefix I-, which generally occurs with transitive verbs,
takes objects marked by the posposition èb´) (21).8(18)       kai    wa--b´)              Îa-d-obièÎ-e

           Although they occur with an ‘object,’ all these verbs behave as intransitives. Assuch, they do not inflect for voice and cannot incorporate their objects.","[238, 239, 240]"
"         Also, if consonant clusters involving voiced stops were indeed preserved in Karajá,one should be able to find cases in which the nominalizer has been preserved after /b/. That,in fact, also happens: the nominal form corresponding to the Karajá verb -bU ‘to cry’ is -brU(cf. Meb. muw ‘to cry’, nominal form muw-r; also compare example 18 in Table 9). Casessuch as *par ‘foot’ :: Karajá wa, where lenition seems to have prevented the creation of anenvironment for cluster formation, provide clues on the relative chronology of thephonological processes postulated herein (*p-lenition must have preceded clusterformation).403.4.1 Residual examples: h-replacement         There are a few verb stems for which, instead of /k/, it is /h/ that is replaced by /r/ inthe nominal form (Table 11). Except for hO ‘to wash’, 41 all of these stems present, after theglottal fricative, a front vowel. Thus, it is possible that such cases represent originalinstances in which *k preceded a front vowel. The velar stop would have undergone a
1992:95). The final consonant was apparently reinterpreted as a suffix in the other branches of the Jê family,
Central and Northern Jê, where the nominalizer –r is still productive.
40
   One should not assume, however, that lenition took place simultaneously for *p and *t. As the survival of *k
demonstrates, different consonants (although belonging to the same “natural class”) may behave differently in
processes such as this (and the same applies to cluster simplification). Lenition of *p and *t and cluster
simplification can both be seen as instances of the same tendency (a Sapirian “drift,” if we will) to weaken
voiceless stops (fully consolidated in pre-consonantal position, but only half-way so in pre-vocalic position).
As for the “preservation” of *k in Karajá, that is only half the story, as we have seen in Chapter 3.
41
   Clear correspondences in Jê for Karajá /h/ have not yet been found. /h/ could have derived historically from a
stop (for instance, */); that would provide an explanation for its behavior, in terms of consonantal replacement,
with the stem hO ‘to wash’.",[294]
"Centripetal direction (‘hither’), marked by the prefix d-, indicates that the process is seen asoccurring towards the current location of the speaker (50b). Centrifugal direction is theunmarked member of the opposition. All verbs are marked for direction, including those thatapparently do not indicate a motion whatsoever, such as UrU ‘to die’. Notice that the cliticaspectual auxiliaries also inflect for direction, and, in the 2nd person, also for person (32).(50)   a.      ♀          ka-r-I-∅-wÈèk´re    b.   ♀           ka-d-I-∅-wÈèk´re

       The system of directional markers in Karajá presents characteristics that traditionallydefine an inflectional category, such as obligatoriness, semantic and formal regularity, andproductivity (Anderson 1985:163; Bauer 1988:73-87; Bybee 1985:11), in spite of predictionsaccording to which direction would not occur inflectionally (Bybee 1985, Talmy 1985). Apossible explanation for the sui generis nature of the phenomenon may be found in the widerange of pragmatic and discourse functions that may be played by directional marking inKarajá: as described in Chapter 3, besides its strictly directional use, directional inflectioncan be used with evidential purposes, as well as to code empathy relationships between theparticipants of the speech act and between narrator and characters in a narrative text.","[59, 60]"

In Karajá, such adistinction is completely dependent on the morphological mechanisms that are madeavailable by the language. Thus, in the examples below, the prefix r- indicates that the eventis seen as occurring away from the current location of the speaker (centrifugal direction),32
   The same set of prefixes is used for singular and plural. There is also a distinction between a first person
plural exclusive (marked by the same set of prefixes used for first person singular) and a first person plural
inclusive (inflected for third person). The prefix k´- ‘3rd person’ is restricted to the centripetal direction of the
irrealis mood.","[184, 185]"

4.2 Nominalization       There are at least three devices to create action nouns from verb stems: zero-affixation or ‘conversion’ (54), consonantal replacement (55), and suffixation (56).(54)   deverbal nouns derived by zero-affixation (‘conversion’)       verb                             noun

       This section examines the hypothesis that lexemes denoting adjectival meanings inKarajá (henceforth ‘descriptives’) are, in fact, nouns (generally, abstract nouns), be they inpredicative or attributive use. That is, words corresponding to adjectives in languages suchas English or Portuguese, such as ‘angry,’ ‘red,’ ‘short,’ would be better translated as abstractnouns—‘anger,’ ‘redness,’ and ‘shortness,’ respectively.","[224, 225]"
"       Such an analysis is particularly appealing if one takes into consideration extendedintransitive verbs, which, as we have seen, take non-canonically marked objects. That is thecase of the verb -ehu ‘to throw’, whose objects are marked with the instrumental postpositionèdI (48a). While, with transitive verbs, the original object cannot be expressed undercausativization, with extended intransitive verbs the original object is preserved with itsoriginal marking, and the original subject (the causée) is expressed as a direct object (48b):(48)   a.      kUladU m´nadI          rehure                                    bOdOIdI

        The main argument for treating causativization as a case of noun incorporation à laSadock (i.e., a case of syntactic word-formation) is the fact that the original verb root seemsto preserve some syntactic saliency, still assigning case to its original, non-canonicallymarked object.","[215, 216]"
"Since most languages presenting [ATR] vowel harmony are genetically or areally related, theKarajá case provides a different perspective for the typological understanding of thephenomenon (Ribeiro 2002). Once again, the chapter does not provide the final word on thesubject, indicating instead additional topics for investigation; for instance, a thoroughaccoustic analysis of the vowel inventory is yet to be conducted, in order to investigatewhether the mechanisms underlying [ATR] distinctions in Karajá are similar to those foundin better-known languages.",[137]
"       Analyzing èdokuri as a speech act clitic helps us to understand the differencesbetween dokuri-clauses and the reason clauses described above: dokuri-clauses are probablyexamples of speech act adverbial clauses, whose function, as defined by Thompson &Longacre (1985:203) “is not to modify or qualify the main clause in any way, but to modifyor qualify, as it were, the speech act which the speaker is performing in uttering the mainclause.” In fact, most attitude markers can be seen as speech-act subordinators to a certainextent, since they anchor the utterance to a previous one; in an example such as (83) below,the attitude markers èTOE ‘enthusiasm’ and èT´) ‘repetition’ can only be interpreted inreference to a previous speech act (it was jokingly said as a warning to a child who insisted inclimbing a tree against a parent’s repeated admoestation):(83)   b´-d-∅-UrUèkreèTOEèT´)

7. Nominalized complements       Corresponding roughly to the subordinate clauses described above, one commonlyfinds nominalized forms of the verbs playing the role of complements. Deverbal nouns maybe preceded by a grammatical possessor which corresponds to the original absolutiveargument of the verb—that is, to the subject of an intransitive verb, such as in wa-rira ‘mywalking’ (from ♀ rika ~ ritSa ‘to walk’), or to the object of a transitive verb, such as in
kOÎUd¸) b´)d´) ‘turtle catching.’ (from b´) ‘to catch’). These constructions occur in any of thefunctions performed by subordinate clauses (or by any NP, for that matter)—that is, assubjects (84), direct objects (85) or objects of postpositions (86-91):(84)   ♀       ir´      ÎaraTa      ∅-r-I-wa-d-EkÈw´TE-d´)èr-a

                 ‘Seeing the sariema bird is difficult.’
In addition, the suffix -dU forms subject nouns (that is, nouns refering to the subject of theoriginal verb), which can be translated as relative clauses (92). The suffix -da), on the otherhand, forms nouns which name instruments, places, or other circumstances related to theaction denoted by the verb (r´T´)-da) ‘food’ < r´T´) ‘to eat’; kOra-da) ‘shredder’ < kOka ‘toshred’; TUrO-da) ‘soap (or any washing device)’ < TUhO ‘to wash’).(92)    r´T´)-da)    wÈdÈ-dU               ∅-r-∅-OrOèr-ErI

  Both ÎEhE ‘to watch, to look at’ and ehu ‘to throw’ take objects marked by the instrumental postposition èdI
(corresponding to what would be direct objects in English or Portuguese). The ‘ball game’ [lit. ‘the throwing of
the ball’] in the example above refers, naturally, to soccer.","[267, 268, 269]"

3.1 Internal versus external relative clauses        Another important distinction is between internal and external relative clauses,according to the location of the domain noun (whether inside or outside the relative clause,respectively; Keenan 1985:143). In all the examples given so far, the domain nouns areinside the relative clauses. However, examples in which the domain noun is outside therelative clause are also easily attested (32).(32)    kai     r´T´)da)

        ‘You ate the food that I brought.’
When an oblique domain noun is separated from the relative clause, notice that thepostposition marking the oblique NP occurs twice—with both the domain noun and thesubordinate clause. That is, the stranded relative clause agrees in case with the domain noun:(33)    iwErUèb´)    r-E-o)èr-a                              ∅-a)dI

3.2 Pronoun retaining strategies       In the previous sections, we concentrate on the syntactic properties of the domainnouns. In this section, attention will be given to the relativized position—that is, the positionin the relative clause which is co-referential with the domain noun. In all the examples ofrelative clauses presented so far, the relativized position corresponds to a core argument ofthe subordinate clause—either the subject, as in (32), or the direct object, as in (33). As theseexamples show, there is no surface indication of which position is relativized, which isindicated by gapping—that is, the relativized NP is simply absent from the relative clause.","[244, 245, 246]"

"The overwhelming majority of verb stems can be assigned to either class; a few stems,however, are marked by less-common prefixes. The class of intransitive verbs includes notonly one-place verbs such as rika ‘to walk’ and -uÎǨÎǨ ‘to become cold’, but also verbs such
as -obi ‘to see’, whose arguments are oblique NPs—in this case, a locative, marked by thepostposition b´) ‘diffuse locative’ (51). Although notionally transitive, such verbs behave asintransitive for all purposes. For example, they cannot be made passive or antipassive, andtheir arguments cannot be incorporated.(51)     ♀        dIkar´) halOkOEm´)         rabire

                  ‘I saw the jaguar.’         Most intransitive verbs can be transitivized, either through causativization or throughthe promotion of an oblique to direct object. The transitivized stem is formed by the nominalform of the verb plus the verbalizer suffix -d´). This is illustrated in the example (52b) below,where the intransitive verb Uka II ‘to be cooked’ is transitivized:16(52)     a.       iwErU             rUkarErI

                  ‘The calugi (a kind of porridge) is cooking.’16
   This example illustrates a very common process for deriving nouns from verb roots, namely consonantal
replacement, which consists in replacing a velar stop or a glottal fricative occurring in the last syllable of the
verb root with an alveolar flap: rika I ‘to walk’ > rira ‘the action of walking’, rira-da) ‘walking place’, rira-dU
‘the one who walks’; TUhO I ‘to wash’ > TUrO ‘the action of washing’, TUrO-da) ‘washing material’, TUrO-dU ‘the
one who washes’ (Ribeiro 1996). Thus, the transitive stem in (46b) above is constructed with the nominal form
of the verb Uka ‘to be cooked’, -Ura ‘the action of cooking’, followed by the verbalizer suffix -d´).",[61]
"3.1.1 Grammaticalization of idZoi ‘guys’       As with id´) ‘human, Karajá,’, the noun idZoi ‘guys’ seems to be undergoing a processof grammaticalization towards pronounness, being often used with first person (singular orplural) connotations. So, a sentence such as (53) below can have a literal reading (a), anexclusive (b) or inclusive (c) 1st person plural reading, a 1st person singular reading (d), or asoft imperative or exhortatory reading (e). In its non-literal uses, idZoi is used mostly indeparting or arriving greetings (‘I’m out of here’, ‘Here we are’, etc.).(53)   idZoi ∅-r-∅-oièkre
       guys    3-CTFG-INTR-go.PL=FUT

           d.        ‘I will go.’
           e.        ‘Let’s go.’
           The text fragment in (54), from a traditional tale (of which another, shorter versionwas published as Ribeiro 2005a), brilliantly illustrates how the ambiguity of idZoi can beexploited for comical effects. In the story, the monkey (krObI) kindly offers to take the turtle(kOÎud¸)) up a jatobá tree so that the latter could eat some fruit. The monkey thennonchalantly decides to leave the turtle behind, up on the tree. The monkey’s departingwords are (54a), to which the turtle replies with (54b); while the monkey clearly has a first-person singular meaning in mind, the turtle demands a first-person plural inclusiveinterpretation.44(54)       a.        idZoi ∅-r-ETEèkre [re""Tekre]

           The grammaticalization of id´) and idZoi parallels that of Brazilian Portuguese a gente‘the people’, which is mostly used with 1st person plural conotations (even though, as inKarajá, the verb displays third-person agreement). Another parallel to thegrammaticalization of idZoi is the evolution of English guys as a 2nd person pronoun

"5. Descriptive words        A number of Macro-Jê languages—including Karajá--are traditionally described aspresenting an active-stative verb agreement system to some degree. According to Fortune &Fortune (1964) and Maia (1998), Karajá verbs are divided into two different classes, activeand stative, with the latter consisting essentially of predicates which denote adjectivalmeanings, the so-called ‘descriptive verbs.’ These predicates take a series of person markerswhich partially coincides with the pronominal object markers in transitive verbs, and whichhappens to be the same series of possessive prefixes occurring with nouns. A more carefulexamination, however, demonstrates that such ‘verbs’ are, in fact, nouns, and that transitivity,rather than stativity, plays a central role in Karajá grammar.",[223]

2.6.3 Verbalization of noun-noun compounds       A number of verbs present compound stems which superficially resemble nounincorporation constructions, but which are actually the result of the verbalization of noun-noun compounds. In some cases, the second element in the noun-noun compound is adeverbal noun, creating constructions which may look, at first sight, as the result of valence-changing noun incorporation, as in the example below:(46)   ♂       a.      biuèkI                 wa-Î
                                       ∅-r-a-Èwa- ÎO-d´)èb´)

                       ‘He sat at the top eating jatobá fruit.’
       That ÎO ‘to eat (sweets), suck’ in (46) is in its nominal form (derived by zero-affixation or conversion) is shown by the fact that it requires the verbalizing suffix -d´). Thatis particularly clear when the deverbal noun is derived by consonantal replacement, as in (47)below, where rÈ is the nominal form of the verb kÈ ‘to eat (grains, bread, etc.)’:(47)   ♂              bolo-rÈÈ-d´)èkre
               a-r-a-bolo-r
               a-CTFG-INTR-cake-eat-VERB=FUT
               ‘I will do some cake-eating.’

                                               203
       All the incorporation constructions described above fit well into the traditional,Sapirian definition of noun incorporation, since they involve independent noun and verbstems which can also occur in non-incorporating constructions. I suggest, however, thatKarajá also has a less usual type of incorporation, similar to what has been described bySadock for West Greenlandic (Sadock 1980), involving the causativizer -d´k´). As we haveseen, -d´k´) selects only nominal stems, in such a way that, in order to be causativized, a verbroot must first be nominalized. I suggest that -d´k´), although morphologically dependent, isa noun-incorporating stem.","[213, 214, 215]"

       -Uk´)           Ur´)            ‘become dry’
       Since the velar stop is generally suppressed in male speech, the formal identitybetween the verb root and the deverbal noun can be rather obfuscated. For example,although the verb roots ♀ aka ‘to run’ and ♀ ka ‘to dig’ may become homophonous in male

speech (♂ a), their deverbal nouns will still differ: ara ‘the action of running’ versus ra ‘the
action of digging’. Therefore, a regular derivational rule can only be identified if the femalespeech is taken into consideration.93.2. d-dropping         This process consists in the deletion in the male speech of an alveolar nasal consonantoccurring in the corresponding female speech form. It seems to involve only two morphemes
9
  A misunderstanding of the male-female speech distinctions may also lead to erroneous ethnographic
statements. Thus, Donahue (1982), appraising the antiquity of Karajá agriculture, suggests that the Karajá word
for ‘corn’ entered the Karajá lexicon through a European language, and that, therefore, the cultivation of this
product was a recent introduction into Karajá culture:         The Karajá word for corn is mai, which happens also to be the French word for corn, both
         surely derived from maize, a word of Carib [sic] origin. It could well be that corn was
         introduced to the Karajá by Europeans after contact, an interesting case of circuitous
         diffusion. If such an American staple of corn were introduced by Europeans, it might indicate
         that the Karajá have come to horticulture quite a bit later than many other central Brazilian
         tribes. [Donahue 1982: 83]Donahue would probably have reached a different conclusion if the female speech form, ba)ki [ma""ki] (which, as
Ehrenreich suggests, represents “an older form of the idiom”), were taken into consideration. Another example
is the analysis of Javaé sexuality suggested by anthropologist Patrícia Rodrigues (1993), based on the mistaken
assumption that the words for ‘vagina’ and ‘skin’ were homophonous:         “[…] the fact that tyky means both ‘skin’, ‘clothes’, and one of the words for ‘body’, and also
         ‘vagina’, could mean that, contrary to western conception, which restrict sexuality to the
         genital organs, the Javaé would understand the whole female body as an extension of the
         vagina, an eroticized whole. The skin that covers the entire body would be as eroticized and
         permeated with sexuality as the genital organ, a notion that transforms the woman (as
         wife/sexual partner) into a sexual being […], as a whole, and not only as a possessor of sexual
         anatomic parts.” [Rodrigues 1993: 312]Interesting as it may sound, this hypothesis does not find any support in the linguistic data. In fact, the words
for ‘skin’ and ‘vagina’ may become homophonous in the male speech, but only when pronounced in isolation.
Since there is a constraint against surface monosylabic words, the word for ‘vagina’, ÎÈ, will be pronounced as
ÎÈÈ when occurring by itself, and, given the phonological processes described above, the word for ‘skin,
clothes’, Î´kÈ (ÎÈkÈ, in Javaé and Xambioá) may be optionally pronounced as ♂ ÎÈÈ. Homophony between these
two words is limited to these cases. They never become homophonous in the female speech. Even in male
speech, they will never become homophonous when combined with other morphemes: i-ÎÈ ‘her vagina’, i-ÎÈÈ
‘her/his/its skin, clothes’.","[149, 150]"
"          In Tupinambá, a Tupí-Guaraní language once spoken along the Brazilian coast,Rodrigues (1996) also treats descriptive words in Tupinambá as nouns; “
          Muitos nomes designam qualidades ou estados, tais como orÈ!B ‘alegria’, -asÈ! ‘dor’, -u!n

          têm sido muitas vezes considerado adjetivos ou verbos descritivos. Entretanto, morfológica e
          sintaticamente eles não diferem dos nomes possuíveis [...]. [Rodrigues 1996: 62-63](73)      Tupinambá (Rodrigues 1996: 63)

                   ‘Your arrows are finished.’
          A similar situation is presented by the ‘relative-anaphoric’ construction in Aleut(Sadock 2000). Sadock describes it as a “highly favored structure in Aleut,” which is“deployed in a surprising array of formally and semantically distinct cases”, includinggenitivization (74), nominal modification (75), and relativization (76).45          Aleut (Sadock 2000)

          However, according to Sadock (op. cit.), in (41) and (42) “the notional modifier is theformal head of the phrase. […] Despite the formal headship facts, the relative case NP (thecounterpart of a possessor) is the semantic head.” Thus, the relative-anaphoric constructionin Aleut presents a striking similarity with genitive-like constructions in Karajá (and in Jê,and in Tupí-Guaraní). The distribution of the relative case marker in Aleut in (39)-(41) isextremely similar to the distribution of relational prefixes in Macro-Jê.","[230, 231]"

interjections expressing surprise or admiration (♀ bi, ♂ bEbE). Examples such as these--
involving interjections and other “emotive words”--are rather common in other languages.","[151, 152]"
"       The iambic nature of stress assignment in Karajá is especially clear withmorphologically complex words. Notice that, in compounds, the original stress pattern of theindividual stems is ‘rearranged’ in order to follow the iambic pattern. One can assume that,although stems can be said to carry stress, the position of such stress is not underlyinglypredetermined. Although the stress is, by default, assigned to the last syllable of a stem, itsultimate position will depend on the morphological or syntactic position of the stem. That isillustrated below by a compound (5a), a case of derivational suffixation (6b), and by avocative phrase involving the vocative interjection, which is stressed (7b). The behavior ofthe stress if further illustrated in (8) and (9), which show stress (re-)assignment undersuffixation (8b) and compounding (9b). As shown in (9c), a possessive phrase such asbrOrE-d¸) hUk´)-TÈ ‘cow’s milk’ can be pronounced as two words (in which case both preservetheir primary stress) or as a single phonological word.",[88]

Caraïbe-français (1664), says that the Caribbean chief had exterminated all the nativesexcept the women, who had retained part of their ancient language.” The women preservedtheir Arawakan language, adopted later by the Kariban conquerors, who retained elements oftheir original language in their speech—giving origin to what came to be called the ‘men’slanguage.’25 Jespersen views this theory with suspicion, and tries to explain such differencesas a result of language taboo. However, in spite of Jespersen’s skepticism, more recentstudies have given further support to the traditional explanation. According to Taylor &Hoff, “it is impossible to explain the available linguistic data unless one accepts the nativetradition that indeed there has been such an invasion”:           The language that is called the women’s language by Breton, but which actually was and is
           the native language of both sexes, is a typical Arawakan language […]. The lexicon is
           Arawakan too, except that it contains a rather large proportion of borrowed Carib (Karina)
           lexemes: about twenty-two percent of the basic vocabulary. Over and above these loanwords
           adopted by the common tongue, the so-called men’s language contained a large number of
           lexemes and some grammatical morphemes of Carib (Karina) provenance, the latter being
           insufficient to formulate most simple sentences without admixture of inherited Arawakan
           grammatical morphemes. [Taylor and Hoff 1980:301]           Another case in which language contact may have played a role in the genesis of maleversus female speech distinctions is Kokama, a language spoken in lowland Peru. Kokama istraditionally classified as a Tupí-Guaraní language. However, Cabral (1995) argues that“Kokama cannot even be classified genetically because its linguistic subsystems do not findcorrelates in a single language or linguistic family source.” Through a comparison withTupinambá (Tupí-Guaraní), a language assumed to have been the lexifier of Kokama, Cabralshows that “except for lexical similarities and a number of sound correspondences, Kokamadiffers greatly from the Tupinambá language in its phonology, morphology and syntax,
