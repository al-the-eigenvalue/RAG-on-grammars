8.2    Noun phrases
       A noun phrase consists minimally of a noun (common or proper), pronoun (personal or
indefinite), substantive determiner (demonstrative: ch ‘the’; kem ‘that’; mwa ‘that’ or inÿe
‘other’, all functioning as a noun ) or substantive numeral (number functioning as a noun). Noun
phrases can include other constituents, such as determiners, adjectives, and prenominal numerals.
They also have case markers, which tend to go on the noun but can also occur at the end of the
entire NP or on multiple constituents in the NP, namely the noun and an adjective that agrees
with the noun. Some constituents of an NP can exhibit overt agreement with the head noun,
indexing the same semantic case and noun class or reflecting the same evaluative suffix as the
noun. Adjectives have class suffixes that agree with their nouns. Additionally, determiners, some
pronouns, and numerals in certain environments bear class suffixes that agree with the classes of
their referents, namely when they follow the noun or when they are in a different NP from the
noun that they agree with, as discussed in 6.3. Furthermore, a number of NP constituents are
marked with evaluative suffixes when they follow or are used substantively: nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, determiners, and numerals, both within a noun phrase or across noun phrases (see
                                                193
3.3.2 for evaluatives). Sometimes these constituents will have evaluative suffixes when they
precede a noun, but generally not.
        Determiners and numerals always precede the heads of noun phrases, with determiners
preceding numerals. Adjectives generally follow the noun, but due to the free word order of
Kamsá they can sometimes precede the noun. There seems to be no appreciable difference in
meaning. Possessors always precede the noun.
        Thus, the order of constituents in a NP is as follows:        [determiner] [possessor] [numeral] [adjective] [noun] [adjective] [adjective]
8.2.1   Heads of noun phrases
        The head of a noun phrase is often a noun, but can also be a non-archetypical nominal,
such as substantive adjectives, personal pronouns, numerals, and determiners (used
substantively). Numbers and determiners always precede the noun, whereas adjectives can
precede or follow the noun.
        If a personal pronoun is the head of the noun phrase, then no other constituents are
permitted. However, the pronoun can exhibit case marking and/or bear an evaluative suffix, with
the case marking always at the end of the noun phrase. Because indefinite pronouns do not show
up frequently in my corpus it is not clear if there can be other constituents in a noun phrase
headed by an indefinite pronoun or what suffixes and clitics can be marked. Two determiners,
the demonstrative kem ‘this, that’ and inÿe ‘other’ can also be heads of NPs when used
substantively. The definite article ch can also stand alone as an NP, but it is more common for
the third person singular pronoun cha, to serve as the entire NP, (8.2.1.2). Determiners are
discussed in 5.4 but here are simply defined as words that show definiteness and/or specificity
and precede the noun (as opposed to adjectives which can precede or follow the noun).
        The following subsections detail the use of various word categories as heads of NPs.","[206, 207]"

1.6.3   Word order and syntax
        The basic order of basic constituents in Kamsá seems to be SOV but it is extremely
flexible and is also perhaps becoming SVO under the influence of Spanish. Kamsá is dependent-                                                 27
marking, with possessors being marked morphologically rather than the thing possessed. The
language also exhibits agreement, with adjectives agreeing with nouns in class, number, and
sometimes case. Oblique phrases tend to follow the subject of the clause and can precede or
follow the verb. Negators almost always precede verbs. Kamsá has mostly postpositions,
although it also has some prepositions that it has borrowed from Spanish. There are some
subordinators that are clause-initial and others that are clause final. In possessive constructions,
the possessor precedes the possessum (possessed) and is marked with a genitive case ending.
Adjectives can either follow or precede the nouns that they modify. Demonstratives and
numerals always precede nouns. Kamsá may be considered a pro-drop language, in that an overt
subject is not a necessary syntactic element.
        Kamsá has nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment. In the third person, S and
A (not O) trigger verbal agreement. There can be also object marking on verbs, mainly for first
and second person objects. When the verb is ditransitive, if the goal is first or second person, it is
marked on the verb (not the theme). Kamsá has a strange characteristic of having dual marking
when there is a transitive sentence with an animate agent and patient. This could be polysemy.
        There is wh-movement for questions: question words always come at the beginning of the
clause. Polar (‘yes/no’) questions do not necessitate any change in word order, and no special
particle is needed, although the tag aiñ o ndoñ ‘yes or no’ is commonly added to the end of the
question with a difference in intonation. Comparatives and superlatives are formed with the
Spanish loanword más ‘more’. Both nouns and adjectives can function as predicate
complements, either without a copula or with an inflected ‘be’ verb.","[40, 41]"

                                                  71
       There is no core argument case marking in the language (i.e. no overt marking for
nominative and accusative). There are various semantic case markers which are oblique markers
distinct from postpositions in that they are not separate words: they are bound morphemes and
they fulfill various semantic functions to oblique case markers. By ""case"" I do not mean any
theoretical definition of 'Case', but rather just a description of oblique marking in the language.","[84, 85]"

        First, I would like to thank all of the Kamsás who welcomed me into their lives: Carmen,
without whom nothing would have been possible; Margarita, Clemencia, Anita, and Maria
Clementina for teaching me their language; Alejandro for all the wonderful conversations about
language, philosophy, and life; as well as Margarita, Andrés, Ivan, Miguel, Luis, Sandra, and
Rosita.
        I have been extremely lucky to have worked with Lyle Campbell, who is the best advisor
anyone could ever hope for. I would also like to thank my committee members, William
O’Grady, Gary Holton, Bob Blust, and Alex Mawyer; and Robert Littman, who was the reason I
was able to do a graduate degree at the University of Hawai‘i.
        My friends in Bogotá offered me incredible support. I would like to thank Pipe for
dedicating his time to working with me on Kamsá; Gustavo, whose conversations kept me going;
Jennifer for always being willing to accompany me into the jungle; Andrea, one of the most
lovely people in the world; Andrés for the evenings in La Candelaria; Edinson for our lunches
together; Daniel for being my bodyguard; Francisco and Gloria for their hospitality; Lili for
being my Colombian mother and friend; Javier for the inspiration; David for the breaks from el
centro; Leidy for sharing insights about Kamsá; Camilo for being wonderful; Jorge for our
mornings in Juan Valdez; Paul for the walks in the rain; Laura and Rajiv … I don’t know where
to begin; Gerriet for always helping; Arturo for becoming my friend at BBC; Ricardo for our
time together; Fernando for helping me before I knew Spanish; Mauricio for making things a
little more fun; Alejandro and Juan for giving me a home; Yinneth for her great knowledge; Katy
for the chats over coffee; and Youlin for helping me before she even knew me. There have been
many other people in Colombia whom I’m grateful to as well: Luisa for opening her home to me;
Henry in Sibundoy; Gloria in Manizales.
        Some friends from the US visited me during my time in Colombia, making my time there
even more pleasant. I’d like to thank John for making the first trip to Sibundoy with me; Ariane
for staying in touch … hopefully we see each other more; Noah, these years have been crazy;
Erik for always being there to talk and helping edit more drafts of things than I can count;
Joachim for being willing to do anything; Craig for being a great friend and going with me to the
beach.
        Other friends who’ve been supportive during my degree, some of whom I’ve known
since elementary school, some I’ve met more recently: Don, Vlad, Laura, Jonathan, and Verna.
I’d also like to thank my parents.
        Other mentors who have guided me during my PhD include Bryan, without whom I may
never have done academia; Caleb for always seeming to believe in me; Thiago for offering
advice along the way in Colombia; and Brett for the advice and contacts, starting in Cambridge.
        I’d like to thank friends and classmates in Hawai‘i who’ve helped in various ways
throughout the PhD process: Eve, Kirsten, Samantha, Kavon, John, Ryan, Sejung, Victoria,
George, Laura, Clara, Kevin, Adila, and Melody.
        I am also grateful for the generous agencies that have helped fund my research including

                                         ABSTRACT
        This dissertation presents a description of the grammar of Kamsá, an endangered
language isolate spoken in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia. It is the first
developed account of the language’s phonology, morphology, and syntax.
        Kamsá is highly endangered due to the displacement of speakers and language shift. A
reference grammar of a previously under-described language offers a number of potential
benefits to general linguistics, showing what is possible in human languages. In addition to
typologists, comparative and historical linguists are always interested to see whether an assumed
isolate may, in fact, be demonstrably related to a known language family. The increasing
endangerment of Kamsá, heightened by the displacement of Kamsá speakers from their ancestral
home, has made the need for documentation and description extremely urgent, and this grammar
will perhaps be useful for the creation of pedagogical materials, as well.

1.1    Summary
       This dissertation presents a description of the grammar of Kamsá, an endangered
language isolate spoken in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia. It is the first
developed account of the language’s phonology, morphology, and syntax.
       Kamsá is highly endangered due to the displacement of speakers and language shift. A
reference grammar of a previously under-described language offers a number of potential
benefits to general linguistics, showing what is possible in human languages. In addition to
typologists, comparative and historical linguists are always interested to see whether an assumed
isolate may, in fact, be demonstrably related to a known language family. The increasing
endangerment of Kamsá, heightened by the displacement of Kamsá speakers from their ancestral
home, has made the need for documentation and description extremely urgent, and this grammar
will perhaps be useful for the creation of pedagogical materials, as well.
       This introductory chapter to this dissertation is organized as follows:
In 1.2, I discuss the Kamsá people and language, including the location, culture, relationship to
other languages, borrowing, and the name of the language. In 1.3 I discuss the language ecology
and language vitality, and in 1.4 I discuss previous research on the language. In 1.5 I describe my
methodology, and in 1.6 I give a typological overview of the language.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

        ‘A hunting dog helped its owners catch a pig in the swamp.’ (Chindoy 55:1) (patron <
        Spanish patrón ‘owner’); kots̈ < Spanish coche ‘pig’)8.4     Postpositional phrases
        Postpositional phrases in Kamsá consist of a noun followed by a postposition. Often case
markers are also present: case markers can occur on the postposition itself, on the noun, or on
both the postposition and the noun. In (34a), the postposition tsëntsa ‘middle’ follows the noun
tsa ‘room’ and tsëntsa has the locative marker -k. Similarly, in (34b) tsëntsa has the case marker
                                               210
-k and the NP preceding it, chëng ‘3PL’, has the genitive marker -be. In (34c) the third person
singular pronoun cha has the genitive marker -be when it precedes bekonan ‘close’. An
alternative analysis is that these are not postpositions, but rather nouns. In (34d) the tsëntsak is
used nominally without any other noun (i.e. just ‘in the middle’ not ‘in the middle of the room’).
Another analysis is that these are compound nouns, not postpositions.(34a) wabowan bëtsëkna tsa tsëntsak jakena
      wabowan         bëtsëk-na      tsa     tsëntsa-k      jakena

      Tsëntsañ-ok=na         ko=jonts̈e       j-atëshenÿnán
      middle=LOC=TOP         ?=begin          VBLZ-get.bright
      ‘(arriving) at the middle, it begin to get bright.’ (Chindoy 70:14)8.5    Prepositional phrases
       Although Kamsá normally employs postpositions, it has borrowed some prepositions
from Spanish. There are no native prepositions in the language (only postpositions), but the
Spanish prepositions are very common now. In (35a), the preposition sin ‘without’ (from
Spanish sin ‘without’) precedes the noun tamo ‘salt’. Nouns governed by the loan preposition sin
take the instrumental case marker -k, as does tamo ‘salt’ below. If the preposition sin were not
present in this sentence, then the phrase would mean ‘with salt’, as illustrated in (35b).
       It is interesting to note that the language has postpositions, and that all subordinators go
at the end of clauses, such as the general subordinator -as and ora ‘when’, but that it has started
borrowing prepositions, and subordinators that go at the beginning of clauses (like ante ‘before’),
so now you can have a mix of things going at the end of phrases and clauses and at the beginning
                                                 211
of verbs and clauses. Furthermore, it is possible that adpositions and subordinators borrowed
from Spanish earlier (maybe several centuries ago) became postpositions or clause final
subordinators, such as ora ‘when’ from Spanish hora ‘time, hour’, whereas recent borrowings
became prepositions or clause initial subordinators.(35a) nÿe s̈men janÿets̈na sin tamok
      nÿe     s̈men          janÿets̈na      [sin          tamo-k]
      only toasted.corn corn.flour           [without      salt-INS]
      ‘only toasted corn flour without salt’ (Chindoy 62:17)(35b) wameshnen tamok
      wameshnen [tamo=k]
      mote         [salt=INS]
      ‘mote (hominy soup) with salt’       In (36a) another common preposition. asta ‘until’ (from Spanish hasta ‘until’), precedes
bastok ‘Pasto (a city near Sibundoy)’. This preposition can have a noun or an infinitive object;
when it takes an infinitive, it is always an uninflected. In (36a) asta bastok means ‘until Pasto’. It
is unclear whether there is case marking on bastok because, like many place names, the
unmarked form is already locative (such as bogotok ‘Bogotá’; tabanok ‘Sibundoy’ and chatjok
‘Mocoa’). In (36b) asta ‘until’ is the preposition and the infinitive belongs to the prepositional
phrase. The verb jwenatjëmb ‘disappear’ is not inflected for person, number, or TAM. In (36c)
asta precedes shachna ‘five’, which is used substantively and has the plural marker -ëng.(36a) ch benach indëmën chatjokan asta bastok.
      ch     benach indëmën       chatjok=an   [asta bastok]
      DET    path 3SG-?-be        mocoa=ABL [until pasto]

      asta ch       shem          j-wenatjëmb          nÿetsá

      ‘Until the woman disappeared completely’ (Chindoy 69:9)(36c) Kada te mojonts̈a ots̈anan kanÿa, utat, asta shachnënga
      kada te        mo-jonts̈a      ots̈anan        kanÿa utat      [asta shachn-ëng]
      each day       3PL-start       lost            one     two     [until five-PL]
      ‘Each day, they started getting lost: one, two, then five.’ (Chindoy 94:7)
                                                 212
       Another preposition, also derived from Spanish, is parej ‘together with’ presumably from
parejo ‘similar, equal, close, next to’. It is interesting because its meaning has shifted from the
Spanish meaning mostly as an adjective to become a preposition. Its noun has a case marker:
commitative for animate nouns and instrumental for inanimate nouns. In (37a) parej
enuntëngaftaka means ‘together with (her) friends’ where enuntëng ‘friends’ has the comitative
marker -aftak. In (37b) parej twambianak means ‘together with that of the hen’ (meaning the
brother discarded the chili along with the piece of hen). Note that in (37b) the noun has the
ablative marker to show source; it does not have -bi even though it’s an animal (and living
animals are animate) because in this sense it is food; and it does not show any object marking.(37a) nÿe s̈ës̈etem jtsabmuchtkoyám parej enuntëngaftaka.

                             Simple clauses (monoclausal sentences)
9.1     Introduction
        In this chapter, I provide an overview of clause-level syntax in Kamsá, a clause being
minimally a verb and a subject (expressed or not expressed). Because verbs are marked for
person and number, a noun or pronoun is not obligatory, thus a clause could be simply a verb.
First I discuss clauses (9.2) including intransitive (9.2.1), predicative (9.2.2), then transitive
clauses (9.2.3) and clauses with complements (9.2.4). In (9.2.5) I discuss clauses with obliques
and in (9.2.6) I discuss ditransitive clauses. In (9.3) I discuss negation and in (9.4) I discuss
comparatives and superlatives. (9.5) covers imperatives and (9.6) describes interrogatives.
        Indexing on the verb clearly shows that the system is nominative-accusative: subjects of
transitive verbs have the same morphemes as subjects of intransitives, both contrasting with the
marking of objects of transitives. NPs and personal pronouns are not marked in any way for
Agent or Patient (see 3.3.3 on noun cases). As seen in the following examples, although the
nouns and pronouns do not have any morphology for case, the verbal morphology is
nominative/accusative.(1a)    ch bobonts tonjachemb tobias̈

8.3.1   VPs consisting entirely of a single verb
        A verb phrase can consist of just a verb (without any other constituents) as seen in (20a),
where the verb jwenatjëmban ‘disappear’ is marked for person, number, and TAM. The prefix
tën- ‘3SG’ indexes the third person singular subject washëntsayá ‘sower’. There is no object,
oblique, adverb, or postposition within the VP. In (20a), the verb phrase contains nothing but a
verb, and the object of the verb that is not present as a full noun is indicated by a cross-
referencing prefix on the verb (k- ‘2SG)’. The prefix b- (which follows the object marker) indexes
a first person singular subject; and the prefix at- marks the mood of the verb as irrealis.(20a) Ndayek tënjwenatjëmba ch washëntsayá?
      ndayek        tën-j-wenatjëmba            ch             washëntsayá

      ‘Yes I will bring you.’ (Chindoy 62:16)8.3.2   VPs with a direct object
        Verb phrases can have expressed direct objects. As there is no case marking on any
nominals (including pronouns) to indicate their role as subject or (direct) object in Kamsá, there
is no morphological difference between subjects and objects. Also, because the word order in
Kamsá is very free, it is generally not possible to use word order to discern which NP is the
subject and which is the object in a transitive clause. In (21), there is no expressed subject; the
NP mongoj ‘deer’ is the direct object of the verb. There is no extra morphology on mongoj to
indicate what its role in the sentence is.","[216, 217]"

                                        Verbal morphology
4.1    Introduction
       Kamsá verbs exhibit intricate morphology, with multiple prefixes and suffixes that index
person and number for subjects and objects and indicate tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality
for events and states. This introduction summarizes the important phenomena of Kamsá verbal
morphology discussed in more detail in the following sections.
       Kamsá verbs reflect a nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment: the person
marking for the single argument (the subject) of an intransitive verb matches the person marking
for the more agentive argument (the subject) of a transitive verb, whereas the marking for the
more patientive argument (the object) is different. Subject marking is obligatory in Kamsá, as is
object marking for first and second person objects.
       In verbs that do not exhibit any object marking, the first verbal prefix is usually a subject
marker, with all other prefixes following this prefix and preceding the stem. There are some
exceptions, however, such as the emphatic prefix kwa- and the perfective marker t-, both of
which may precede the subject prefix. When a transitive verb exhibits overt object marking (that
is, in verbs with first or second person objects), the object marker is the first prefix on the verb,
followed by the subject marker, and then followed by all other prefixes and the stem.
       This introductory section summarizes the different morphemes that Kamsá verbs can
have, all of which are discussed in more depth in the rest of this chapter.
       A verb consists minimally either of a root plus inflectional morphology or a root with the
prefix j- and the suffix -an or -am. A root can never appear alone. Some examples of verb roots
are the following. The elicitation forms always have j- and -an, thus I write them as such here.
As seen in these examples, verb roots can start with /a/, /o/, or /w/.       j-abwamiy-an ‘buy’
       j-achway-an ‘greet’
       j-alants-an ‘dance’
       j-amn-an ‘be’
       j-as-an ‘eat’
       j-ayan-an ‘say’                                                  87
       j-otbem-an ‘sit’
       j-owen-an ‘hear’
       j-oyebwambay-an ‘speak’
       j-wabw-an ‘cook’
       j-wabwem-an ‘write’
       j-washaby-an ‘wash clothes’       While all person (subject and object) and TAME (tense, aspect, mood, evidentiality)
prefixes precede the root, there are a few suffixes that can appear on a root as well. Some
prefixes are portmanteau, simultaneously encoding multiple grammatical categories, such as both
person and tense or both tense and aspect. All inflected verbs are marked for both person and
number.
       Verbs also exhibit TAM marking. There are many prefixes that combine with each other
for different tenses and aspects. In this chapter, I discuss all of the various morphemes that can
occur on verbs. First, I discuss person and number subject marking (4.2) then person and number
for object marking (4.3). In 4.4, I discuss the different tense, aspect, mood, and negation
prefixes. In 4.5, I discuss evidentiality, followed by reciprocal marking in 4.6. In 4.7, I discuss
the imperative form m-, and in 4.8 I show the intensifying prefix kwa-. The last sections are
dedicated to suffixes.","[99, 100, 101]"

        ‘I come with music.’ (Chindoy 85.3)        In (4), the first person singular is the subject and the independent pronoun is present, but
the direct object, the second person singular, is marked on the verb and does not appear as an
independent pronoun.(4)     ats̈ chekbojamanda chka

The verb also is marked for first person singular object, as well as with m- for imperative. Note
that ats̈ here, when it is an object, has the same form as when it is a subject (as in (4)) but the
verbal morphology is different.(5)     ats̈ mwents̈e s̈mëntjofja

on the verb. The subject is marked with mo- which agrees with third person plural subjects. The
object is marked with k-, the marker for second person objects. Note that the object agreement
marker precedes the subject agreement marker on the verb. This is discussed more in 4.3 on
object marking prefixes on verbs.(6)     k-mo-n-chan-tse-shbwas

5.1.4     Pronoun cases
          Each pronoun in Kamsá can take a variety of case markers, all of which are suffixes, and
postpositions. They are the same as the case markers discussed in Chapter 2.2.3, and the case
markers that require the animate marker -bi for animate nouns, are the same for pronouns. Thus,
the allative and benefactive both require -bi, whereas the genitive -be does not, and the
comitative is -abtak, perhaps deriving from -bi + -ak. Figure 5.2 summarizes the pronoun forms
of the genitive, allative, benefactive, and comitative.","[152, 153, 154]"

        The nominal system of Kamsá is somewhere along the spectrum between having case
suffixes versus postpositions. In this section, I first outline the case system, showing each of the
cases and postpositions and their allomorphs, and giving examples of some of the uses of each
case and postposition. Then I discuss the distribution of each case and postposition, showing
whether it can occur with common nouns (both animate and inanimate where possible), proper
nouns, pronouns, and loans words. Many cases are different for animate nouns and inanimate
nouns: namely, animate nouns have the suffix -bi preceding the case marker whereas inanimate
nouns do not. Also, there are some cases which do not seem to be possible semantically with
proper nouns or pronouns (such as the instrumental) and others that are not possible with
inanimate nouns (such as the comitative). This will become apparent with each case that has this
distinction and will be discussed further. At the end of this section, I give evidence for why
some things are actual cases whereas other things seem to be postpositions.","[83, 84]"
"
13: Some have transitive/intransitive distinctions but most do not:
         “However, in most of the central Andean languages (including Aymaran and Quechuan)
the transitive / intransitive distinction hardly plays a role” (Adelaar 2008:29). It is important to
note that this means that the verbs do not have transitive vs intransitive morphology, but objects
can still have accusative case.",[44]
"
5.2     Independent pronouns
        Kamsá has nine personal pronouns for subject/object. As with nouns, there is no
morphological difference for pronouns that would depend on whether they function as the
subject of an intransitive sentence, the subject of a transitive sentence, or a direct object. They
mostly behave as nouns do in the language. They take case markers, and sometimes evaluatives.
Like nouns, they do not seem to take class markers when they are referring to a noun with class
markers. this section does not discuss pronominal affixes (e.g. pronominal agreement markers on
verbs). Kamsá is a prodrop language. Person and number is marked by agreement affixes on the
verb, both for subjects and objects, and the pronoun is not necessary.",[149]

       Kamsá has a genitive marker which shows possession. Kamsá is a dependent-marking
language in that it marks the possessor, not the possessee. The genitive marker is the suffix -be
and has no allomorphs. In (34a), bata ‘aunt’ has the genitive suffix -be to show that it is her
friend. In (34b), a noun that ends with a consonant is show: bobonts ‘young man’ is bobonts-be
in the genitive, without any phonological change.(34a) ats̈ sënjojinÿ batabe enuta

      ‘(the) young man’s parents’ (Chindoy 91) (from bëtsëtsat ‘parents’ from bëts ‘big’)       The genitive is mostly used for possession, for family members and physical objects. It
can be used for possession by a definite noun, as seen above in (34a), where it is about a
particular aunt. Nouns that are not definite or specific can also be possessed as seen in (35)
where the speaker is talking about a sound that sounds like the scream of a human or a bark of a
dog.",[86]

      ‘The girl cooked mote for us.’       The benefactive is productive and can be used with loan words. In (45), three loan words
have the benefactive marker: popayej-ëng-byam, pastus-eng-byam, and bogotill-ëng-byam, all of
which are Spanish names (albeit derived from other indigenous languages) of cities, used on
proper nouns, as seen in (45), from a text about preparing spots in Hell for people from several
Colombian cities, including Popayan, Pasto, and Bogotá. Each noun is composed of the city                                                76
name, followed by the plural marker, followed by the animacy marker -bi, then finally the
benefactive suffix. Note that the case marker comes after the plural marker.(45)    s̈mochtseprontay pwesto popayejëngbiam,

        (Chindoy 68:6)3.3.3.4 Instrumental
        The instrumental case is -ak and has the additional allomorphs -k and -ek. When the noun
ends in a consonant, the form is always -ak. When a noun ends in a vowel, the form is that vowel
+ -k When a noun ends in the glide y, the form is -ek.
        In (46a), when -ak is added to the root s̈knen ‘plate’ it becomes s̈knen-ak. When the noun
ends in a vowel, however, the root vowel remains. Thus tomo ‘salt’ with an instrumental ending
becomes tomok, not /*tomak/ nor /*tomoak/. Likewise, in an example where the noun ends in
/a/, the suffix is also /-k/ as seen in (46c) where tsëts̈a ‘aji’ becomes tsëts̈ak, not /*tsëts̈aak/ or
/*tsëts̈aɁak/. Finally, in (46d) the instrumental is seen on shachbuy ‘tear’ which ends in the glide
/y/. When -ak attaches to this noun, it becomes/ -ek/, perhaps because of phonetic reasons.(46a) ch bobonts s̈o-n-japega s̈knen-ak

      ‘He started to tell (the story) with a tear…’ (Chindoy1 68.2)        In addition to the uses of the instrumental shown above, where it often shows the literal
item used to accomplish a task, it can be used as a more metaphorical instrument as in (46d)
above when the narrator is telling his story ‘with a tear’.
        The instrumental can also be used for other idiomatic uses and with certain verbs, such as
the following example where the verb ‘to be full of’ takes the instrumental case. Note that there
are no postpositions or prepositions in this sentence, only the verb. Also note that although the
instrumental case is usually only found on inanimate common nouns, here it occurs on an
animate noun.(47)    ch wajokainsha intsjutjen yents̈engak
        ch     wajokainsha i-n-ts-jutjen                      yents̈-eng-ak

        ‘The car is full of people.’        The instrumental case is also used with the preposition sin from Spanish sin 'without'. In
(48) tamo ‘salt’ is preceded by sin ‘without’ and has the instrumental case marker -ak, here
realized as /-k/.(48)    nӱe s̈men janӱets̈na sin tamok
        nӱe     s̈men           janӱets̈na      sin          tamo-k
        only toasted.corn corn.flour            without      salt-INS
        'only toasted corn flour without salt' (Chindoy1 62.17)Although there are no native prepositions in Kamsá, it has borrowed some prepositions from
Spanish that have changed their meanings to become more grammatical. One example is parej
from Spanish pareja ‘pair, couple’. In Kamsá, it is used to mean ‘together with’ and takes the
instrumental case. In (49), parej is used with ibet ‘night’ to mean with each respective night
(paired with each respective night).(49)    chana nӱe unga te parej ibetak
        cha=na         nӱe     unga te         parej ibeta-k
        3SG=TOP        only three day          with night-INS
        ‘he only (spent) three days with their respective nights.’ (Chindoy1 67:1)                                                 78
       This phenomenon is interesting in determining if these suffixes are case or not because it
is one of the rare situations in Kamsá where the case suffix occurs with an additional adposition.
At the same time, it is problematic because both of the adpositions shown above are loan words
from Spanish.
       The instrumental can occur on inanimate common nouns. It rarely occurs on proper
nouns, pronouns, or animate common nouns, probably due to semantic limitations, that these
things cannot normally be semantic instruments. In my data, this case mainly occurs with
inanimate nouns.
       The instrumental case ending is very productive, though, and is used with loanwords. In
(50a) kuchiyo from Spanish cuchillo ‘knife’ has the instrumental suffix -k. The second example
(50b) is even more interesting in that the case ending -ak appears on the loan word asukar
‘sugar’ (from Spanish azúcar) and has the word sin (also from Spanish) ‘without’.(50a) kuchiyok
      kuchiyo-k
      knife-INS
      ‘with a knife’(50b) sin asukarak

      ‘without sugar’ (asukar < Spanish azúcar ‘sugar’)3.3.3.5 Comitative
       The comitative in Kamsá is for accompaniment and only applies to animate nouns. The
form is -abtak (often pronounced as /-aftak/) and the initial vowel of this affix is deleted when
the noun ends in a vowel. In (51a), kes̈ ‘dog’ takes the suffix -abtak, with the first /a/ maintained;
however, in (51b), batá ‘aunt’ ends in a vowel; thus batá + abtak becomes bata-btak.(51a) su-n-j-a ats̈-be kes̈-abtak

      1SG 1SG-EVI-VBLZ-cook mote               1SG-GEN               aunt-COM
      ‘I cooked mote with my aunt.’       It is likely that the comitative is derived from the instrumental. Many case markers on
animate nouns must be preceded by -bi as shown above with the benefactive. Thus, it is possible
that the comitative was noun + bi + ak and underwent some phonological or phonetic changes.
For clarity the two cases are compared:       comitative: kes̈-abtak ‘with the dog’
       instrumental: s̈knen-ak ‘with the plate’       Proper nouns can have the comitative marker as seen in (52a) where Carmen, has -abtak.
All personal pronouns can also take -abtak. One example is shown in (52b) where -ak, the
second singular pronoun, has the suffix -abtak. It is also productive and is attached to loan
words. In (52c), -abtak is added to madrang ‘nuns’ a loan word from Spanish madre ‘mother’.
Note that the word madgra-ng is plural, and that the comitative marker comes after the plural
marker.(52a) ats̈ sënjwabwa wameshnen Carmen-abtak

3.3.3.6 Locative
       The locative is used for the location of something. For inanimate nouns, it is formed by
adding -ok to the root of the noun. In (53a) yebn becomes yebnok and in (53b) beti ‘tree’
becomes betyok.(53a) Yebunok kots̈bian wabwanaingna

      ‘The bird is in the tree.’       For animate nouns, the locative is formed with the suffix -bi followed by -ok. The
meaning (for humans) is ‘at the house of’, like donde ‘where, at’ in Spanish (as in Está a donde
Juan ‘he/she is at John’s [at John’s place/house]). In (54), bobonts ‘young man’ has the locative
to mean ‘at the house of the young man.’(54)   (...) tobias̈ na yejtaysashjango bobontsbioka

       Kamsá nouns have suffixes that are somewhere between case markers and postpositions.
They do not seem like true case markers because they do not differentiate between subjects and
objects, yet they are not really postpositions because many of them are phonologically part of the                                                 85
noun. Also, some of them function with other adpositions or special verbs that take a certain
case, much like cases do typologically. Some of the cases also require an animacy marker bi- for
animate nouns preceding the case, namely the benefactive, allative, locative and ablative. The
comitative perhaps comes from the instrumental but underwent a phonological change. The
genitive is the only case that is the same for animate and inanimate nouns, always -be.
Postpositions are discussed in 8.4.
         The noun cases are shown in the Figure 3.5 below.","[98, 99]"
"
8.2.3.1 NPs with case-marking clitics
        NPs can have case marking. Usually, case marking is a clitic attached to the last element
of the NP, after the class marker, as discussed in 3.1.12. In (18), bwangan ‘red’ has the
morphemes wa- and -ya to agree with wasnaniya ‘poncho’. In addition, it has the case marker -k
for the instrumental. As discussed in 3.1.12, case marking clitics come after the suffixes on
nouns including the suffixes for class, number, and evaluatives.(18)    suntatbonja s̈es̈on wasnaniya wabwanganiyak
        su-ntatbonja s̈es̈on [wasnani-ya wa-bwangani-ya-k]

        ‘I covered the baby with the red blanket.’ (MC)8.2.3.2 NPs with topic marker =na
        The topic marker =na, which is particularly common in narratives, often cliticizes to
NPs, usually the last element in the noun phrase. In (19a), yendon ‘squirrel’ exhibits the clitic
=na,. It can attach to pronouns, as well, as seen in (19b). The topic marker =na is always the last
element of the NP: in (19c) =na comes after the locative marker =ok. Similarly, in (19d), =na
cliticizes to the second element in the NP, coming after the evaluative -jem. In (19e) =na also
cliticizes to the second element in the NP tsbanan ‘tall’ and comes after the allative case marker
-oy.",[215]

       Kamsá does not seem to have reciprocal pronouns. Rather, the reciprocity is marked on
the verb with the prefix en- The verb ‘to say’ takes different morphemes depending on whether
there is a hearer or whether it is mutual as seen in (11): j-ayanan is less transitive, while j-
auyanan, with the /u/ means ‘to tell someone’, and j-enyanan, with /en/ means that the telling is
reciprocal, telling each other. This is discussed more in 4.6.(11)   jayanan ‘say’
       jauyanan ‘tell someone’
       jenyanan ‘tell each other’       The following two examples show the verb j-ayanan ‘to say’ as a reciprocal and with a
hearer. In (12a) the verb has the reciprocal marker en-, and in (12b), the verb has the marker au-
to show that there is a hearer. The hearer is marked with the allative marker -bioy.(12a) enabwatmat (...) bojenyan

       This section discusses the determiners, both articles and demonstratives.
       Kamsá has one article, ch, which is probably related to the third person singular pronoun
cha. It is used for definiteness/specificity but more research is needed. The language has one                                                 144
main demonstrative kem, which basically means ‘this’. Both ch and kem can modify animate and
inanimate nouns, although ch is used very often with animate nouns and not so often with
inanimate nouns. Also, ch is used more when the noun is the subject (which is, of course, related
to the previous observation). kem can also be used for both animate and inanimate nouns. Both
ch and kem, when part of an NP, come at the beginning, regardless of the order of the other
words in the NP and they can both stand alone, not as part of a larger NP. When the determiners
are part of an NP, they do show any overt marking of agreement with the noun, but if they stand
alone, they agree with their referent/antecedent in class, and sometimes in case and/or number. In
addition to ch and kem, there is also kanÿe ‘one’ and inÿa ‘other’ that I include in this section
because they behave similarly to ch and kem, also occurring at the beginning of an NP and
agreeing with their referent/antecedent when they stand alone. Himmelmann uses the following
two criteria to distinguish between articles and demonstratives:
- articles occur only in nominal expressions, whereas demonstratives may appear as pronouns,
adverbials, predicates or adnominal modifiers;
- within the nominal expressions articles occupy a fixed position, either consistently to the left or
to the right of the noun, whereas demonstratives may occur on either side of the noun in many
languages. (Himmelmann 2001:832)
        Kamsá does not seem to have these distinctions. All determiners must go at the beginning
of the NP when they’re part of the NP, and they can all stand alone. That being said, it is rare for
ch to stand alone; ch is extremely frequent as part of an NP, but it rarely stands alone.
        The four determiners discussed in this chapter are presented in Figure 5.3.","[156, 157, 158]"

5.2.3   Use of pronouns and alignment: subject and object
        In Kamsá, there is no difference in form between subject and object pronouns, just as
there is no difference in form between subject and object nouns. The language is thus neither
nominative/accusative nor ergative/absolutive in its alignment for pronouns.
        In (2a), the first person singular pronoun ats̈ is the subject of an intransitive sentence,
with jan ‘go’ as the verb. The verb agrees with the subject, shown by the first person singular
subject marking së. In (2b) ats̈ is the subject of a transitive sentence. As in (2a), the verb has the
prefix së- to show that the subject is first person singular. In (2c), ats̈ is the direct object of a
transitive verb. There is no change to ats̈; the form is identical to that in (2a) and (2b). The verb
in (2c) is marked with a first person singular prefix s̈o- to agree with the direct object.","[151, 152]"

when it is functioning as a relativizer (discussed more in Chapter 11 on subordination), as seen in
(12). Here, ch does not belong to the NP headed by the first person singular pronoun ats̈; rather,
it is functioning as a relativizer.(12)    i ts̈ëngaftanga, ch ats̈ s̈mëstonëngna

        In addition to modifying other heads of noun phrases, determiners (when functioning as
substantives) can serve as heads of noun phrases. In (13a), repeated from above, mwa ‘this, that’
is the head of a noun phrase. In (13b) inÿe ‘other’ is the head of the NP with the determiner ch

           Noun phrases with numerals as the heads can have determiners, as seen in (14), where
esconëfta bnë́ tsana ‘ninety nine’ (referring to sheep) is marked with both the article ch and inÿe
‘other’.(14)       ch inÿe esconëfta bnë́ tsana

           ‘the other ninety nine (sheep)’ (ch = <chë> in original orthography) (Matthew 18:12)8.2.1.5 Adjective as head of an NP
           Adjectives, when used substantively, can serve as head of an NP. In (15), bwangan ‘red’
is used substantively to mean ‘the red (one)’, here referring to a feather. It has the suffix -jwa to
agree in class marking with plumubjwa ‘feather’, which is not present here. (Note plumu- <
Spanish pluma ‘feather’)(15)       Wabwanganabjwa yotsetsebwanaka.

8.2.2   Noun phrase agreement
        Other elements of an NP can agree with a noun in class, number, case, and evaluative.
Often they will agree with a noun that is not present in the NP, indexing the noun by bearing
morphemes that agree with the missing noun in class, number, case, and/or evaluative
(anaphorically) to indicate they are tracking a noun mentioned earlier but not repeated later in the
discourse.
        As discussed in (3.2) on noun class, adjectives in a noun phrase must agree with the noun
they modify (unless the adjective precedes the head noun). In (16a), the adjective bën ‘long’
agrees with bichaj ‘tongue’ in class, with the suffix -j. In (16b) the adjectives botaman
‘beautiful’ and bseng ‘black’ both agree in class with wasniya ‘poncho’, in that they are marked
with the prefix wa- and the suffix -iya, both of which are found on the noun. For nouns that do
not have the prefix wa- but for which adjectives agreeing with them have wa- see section 3.2.(16a) ch mëts̈kway indobmën bënëj bichaj
      ch      mëts̈kway     i-nd-obmën                       bënë-j          bicha-j

      ‘The snake has a long tongue.’ (MC 33)(16b) Ch wasnaniya wabotamaniya indowamën i wabsengiya.
      ch     wa-snan-iya wa-botaman-iya            i-nd-o-wa-mën             i         wa-bseng-iya

      ‘The poncho is beautiful and black.’ (i < Spanish y ‘and’)        Numerals and determiners are not generally marked in any way to agree with the head
noun of their NP. This may be so because these parts of speech always precede the noun.
However, when a numeral is a head of its own NP, it must agree in class with its (implied but
absent) referent. In (17a), the numeral unga ‘three’ is marked with the classifier -be to agree with
mashakbe ‘lulo fruit’, even though this noun occurs in a separate phrase. Similarly, in (17b), inÿe
‘other’ has the class marker -jwa to agree with yents̈iya ‘cloth’. (See 3.2 for why the class marker
is -jwa instead of -ya.)(17a) Kanÿe mashakbe indoben joyebambayan i ungabe ndoñ.

        There are at least two phrase level clitics that occur at the end of NPs. These include case
marking clitics and the topic marker =na. If =na is present in an NP it is always the last element
of the NP.","[210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215]"
"
1.6.2   Morphology and word classes
        Kamsá has complex morphology and is polysynthetic. There are prefixes and suffixes,
but not infixes or circumfixes. Verbs are primarily prefixing. Nouns and adjectives primarily
have suffixes. But verbs also bear suffixes, and all parts of speech can have certain suffixes.
Nouns and adjectives can have prefixes, as well.
        Verbs have prefixes for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, evidentiality, emphasis, and
more, and have a few suffixes for TAM and nominalization. Kamsá verbs have morphological
marking distinguishing singular, plural, and dual. There is a distinction between present, recent
past, distant past, and future. There’s a two-way system of evidential marking. Negation is
shown with a negator and verbal prefixes; the verb has several options for prefixes. There are a
few clitics, as well, including subordinators.
        Nouns have suffixes. These suffixes show number, case, class, and more. Noun class
markers are part of the noun; the noun cannot appear without its class marker. Cases can stack,
i.e. a noun can bear multiple case markers. Nouns can also appear with postpositions, but they do
not have to. Case markers may be clitics or may be suffixes. Nouns can be singular, plural, or
dual, shown by suffixes, but number marking on nouns is not obligatory.",[40]
"
11: Accusative marking and/or disambiguating suffix indicating actor as opposed to unmarked
object
         “Accusative case marking is found in several central Andean languages (Aymaran,
Quechuan, Barbacoan, Páez, also in the pre-Andean Jivaroan languages), but less so in the
northern Andes (cf. Constenla 1991) and in the south. Some northern languages, viz. Chimila,
Ika (both Chibchan) and Cholón, feature a disambiguating affix that indicates an actor in
opposition to an (unmarked) object” (Adelaar 2008:29).
         Kamsá does not have accusative case marking; S, A, and O are unmarked. There is an
optional clitic =na, however, that possibly marks actors. It is discussed in 8.2.3.2.",[44]
"
10: Case marking on nouns by suffixes or postpositions
         “Case marking on noun phrases expressed by means of suffixes or postpositions is
common in Andean languages” (Adelaar 2008:29).
         Kamsá nouns have case marking with nine cases. These all suffixes.",[44]
"
3.2    Noun classes
       Kamsá has a system that falls between noun class and noun classifier, typologically,
fitting neither definition neatly. Here I choose the term class because the markers are an
obligatory part of the noun. Kamsá does not have grammatical gender, but there are at least 10
class markers that exist in the language, as well as a subset of nouns in which the noun itself is a
suffix, often called a ‘repeater’ in other South American languages. The class markers are bound
morphemes; they are suffixes which form a phonological word with their host and cannot be
removed or changed. Demonstratives, adjectives, and sometimes numerals which agree with the
noun have a matching suffix, depending on the position of the demonstrative, adjective, or
numeral in relation to the noun. A few classes are signaled by both a prefix and a suffix, but no
classes are signaled by a prefix without a suffix.
       The majority of nouns in Kamsá do not belong to a noun class; the nouns with class
markers are a very small subset of the nouns in the language. The majority of nouns have no
special suffix and the adjectives, demonstratives, or numerals which agree with them do not take
a special suffix, either. Although some noun classes have something semantic in common, such
as signifying that the objects are round or hairy, many do not fall into a particular semantic
domain, and for some classes, I have not found enough nouns to determine what if any the
semantic relationship for the nouns could be.
       After showing that most nouns do not belong to the class of nouns that require a class
marker, I show 11 noun classes and one additional suspect noun class. For each category, I give
an example of the noun with an adjective, where possible with the adjective bchenda ‘blue’.
Then, I give other examples of other nouns in the class. Finally, for each category I offer an
explanation of what could connect them semantically. Where possible, I include both native
Kamsá words and loanwords from Spanish that belong to the class. The loan words that have
class markers may lend additional insight into the semantic domain of these noun classes because
they are more recent additions to the class. I start with the the unmarked noun class giving
examples of a human, an object, a place, and an abstract thing, to show that there is no class or                                                 55
gender for these words, the majority of words in the language. There is no morphological
difference in the root between animate and inanimate nouns, or between human and nonhuman
nouns. Again, it is important to emphasize that most nouns in Kamsá do NOT have any class
marker, while there are some very specific groups of nouns that do have special noun-class
suffixes.","[68, 69]"

                                             Adjectives
6.1    Introduction
       Adjectives in Kamsá are an open class of words. I define them as being words that can
agree with nouns in class, number, and sometimes evaluatives and/or case; that can be
intensified; and can take comparative degrees. Their typical functions are to modify
nouns/nominals (attributive adjectives, e.g. the big dog) and as adjectival predicate complements
(e.g. the dog is big). Their defining criteria in my analysis is their ability agree with nouns
because nouns cannot agree with other nouns.
       An adjective can agree with a noun that it modifies in class, number, and evaluative
marking. Adjectives often take the case marker for a noun phrase, and they can sometimes agree
with a noun in case. Adjectives can be intensified with adverbs such as bien ‘very’ and yap
‘very, much’. Adjectives can also take comparatives.
       The following examples show the morphology that adjectives have when agreeing with
nouns. This chapter discusses this morphology in greater depth. In (1b) the adjective bwangan
‘red’ agrees with chembalbe ‘tree tomato’ with the class marker -be. In (1c) bwangan ‘red’
agrees with the plural noun s̈lofts̈ëng with the plural marker -ang. In (1d) stjnëj ‘hair’ has the
diminutive marker -tem, as does the adjective ftseng ‘black’ that agrees with it. In (1e) both the
noun chembalbe ‘tree tomato’ and bochan ‘ripe’ have the instrumental case marker -k. In
addition, the adjective bochan agrees with chembal-be in class, as shown by the suffix -be. In
(1f) the adjective is intensified with yap. Finally, in (1g) an adjective is used in a comparative
construction with mas ‘more’. These qualities of adjectives are discussed further in the following
sections of this chapter.(1a)   bwangan ‘red’(1b)   chembalbe indemun bwanganbe

       Adjectives tend to end in /a/, /o/, or /á/. Adjectives that end in /o/ or /a/ lose this final
vowel when they precede the noun, but adjectives ending in the stressed vowel /á/ do not lose the
final vowel. In Figure 6.1 botamana ‘beautiful’ is botamán when preceding a noun and
botamana when following the noun or standing alone after the verb. i-nd-emën is the third
singular present form of j-amnan ‘be’.botamán tobias̈                                      ‘beautiful girl’

can be betsk and podesko ’ugly’ can be podesk when preceding a noun. Adjectives that end in
                                                 151
stressed /á/ cannot lose the vowel regardless of the position of the adjective. ‘Fat dog’ can be
either oboná kes̈ (fat dog) or kes̈ oboná (dog fat), but not *obon kes̈.

                                                Nouns
3.1    Introduction
       In this chapter, nominal morphology and the structure of noun phrases in Kamsá are
discussed. First, I lay out the inflectional morphology that nouns can take, and the head of the NP
is identified, along with other elements that can be part of the noun phrase, including
demonstratives, numbers, adjectives, and adpositions. Nouns are an open class in Kamsá.
       Nouns can bear inflectional morphology, although a noun can be a word without any
bound morphemes. The inflectional morphology includes: number marking (plural and dual),
noun class markers, a topic marker, and a determiner that is a clitic preceding the noun. Kamsá
has derivational morphology, including suffixes to make an agent from a verb and evaluatives
(diminutives, augmentatives, and pejoratives). Kamsá nouns that are derived from verbs also
lack morphology, i.e. they are stripped of the morphology of the verb.
       Although Kamsá nouns can have multiple suffixes, it is not common for all possible
suffixes to appear on a single noun at the same time. For example, a noun would not normally
have a plural marker, a diminutive suffix, and a class marker all at once. If the noun has a class
marker, the diminutive and/or the plural marker do not appear. Class markers are obligatory for
those nouns that fall in the class of nouns that have class markers, whereas number marking is
optional, and diminutives (by their nature) are also optional. Case markers are more flexible,
because although they are obligatory, they can appear at the end of the noun phrase instead of on
the noun itself, as discussed further below.","[66, 67]"

3.2.13 Noun class with plural
           When a noun is plural, the class marker comes before the plural marker. In (26) shemnë-
be ‘egg’ has the class marker -be and is followed by -ng to show it is plural. Note that the plural

           ‘eggs’           McDowell states that noun class markers (which he terms noun classifiers) can be added
to words that do not necessarily have them as a way to be creative with the language (1994). He
gives the following example. In (27), from one of McDowell’s texts, the determiner ch refers to
the oso ‘bear’ mentioned before in the same line. The determiner ch has the noun class marker -
be which is used for round things. According to McDowell, this means he is being referred to as
a round person, and that he is a humorous oaf rather than a fierce suitor that bears are in other
stories.(27)       i ch osona, chbe yojtsaishniy
           i       ch     oso-na           ch-be          yo-jtsaishniy
           and     DET    bear-TOP         DET-CLF        3G.PST-put.on.fire
           ‘And as for that bear, he put (them) on the fire.’ (From McDowell 2014:220)           I have not found any productivity with noun class in my data. McDowell gives one
example of this occurring, and it is with -be. Whether or not other class markers could be used
productively is unknown. If it is true, however, then these noun class markers perhaps seem more
like noun classifiers than markers of noun classes.","[77, 78, 79]"

6.3.1   Plural marking on adjectives
        Adjectives can have plural markers and dual markers. Number agreement is not
obligatory. In (2a) the adjective botamana ‘beautiful’ has the plural marker -ëng to agree with
the plural noun yebnëng ‘houses’. In (2b) bën ‘tall’ has the plural marker -ang to agree with the
plural pronoun bëng ‘we (pl)’. In (2c) there are two adjectives bëts ‘big’ and basa ‘small’ both
agreeing with the plural pronoun chëng ‘they’.(2a)    ch yebnëng botamanëng yomën
        ch     yebnëng        botamanëng      yo-mën

        3PL    big-PL        and     small-PL
        ‘They are big and small.’ (MC)6.3.2   Class markers on adjectives
        As discussed in 3.2, there is a subset of nouns in Kamsá that has class markers.
Adjectives that agree with nouns that have class markers must bear these class markers. As seen
in (3a) the adjective gobshn ‘green’ has the class marker -be to agree with the noun shemne-be
‘egg’. In (3b) there are two adjectives, botamana ‘beautiful’ and bseng ‘black’ agreeing with the
noun wasnaniya ‘blanket’ and they both have class markers. As discussed in 3.2.3 some nouns in                                                 153
Kamsá have a class marking suffix as well as the prefix wa-. In (3b) both adjectives have the
suffix -ya and the prefix wa-.(3a)    ch bobonts tbonjacheta ch tobias̈ shemnebe gobshnebe

        Adjectives can have evaluatives. The adjective can have the evaluative whether the noun
has an evaluative or not. In (4a) both the noun and adjective have the diminutive suffix -tem:
gobshin ‘green’ agrees, having the diminutive marker -tem to agree with bominÿ-tem ‘eyes’. In
(4b) gobshin ‘green’ has the suffix -tem but the noun, bominÿ ‘eye’ does not. In (4c) the
adjective has the class marking prefix wa- and the diminutive -tem. Also note that the adjective is
a loan word from Spanish delgado ‘thin’. In (4d) the adjective bëtsa ‘big’ has the diminutive -
tem.(4a)    bominÿetem gobshintem indëmën

        Adjectives can have case markers. Generally, the last element of the NP (usually the noun
or adjective) has the case marker. It is also possible for multiple elements of the NP to have the
case marker, i.e. the noun and adjective can both be marked. In (5a), repeated from (1e) above,
both the adjective and the noun are marked with the instrumental marker -k. In (5b) only the
adjective, which is the last part of the NP, is marked with the instrumental marker. As with
nouns, on adjectives the case marker comes after the number markers, as seen in (5c).(5a)    ats̈ sënjwaba mntsen chembalbek bochanbek

6.4    Types of adjectives
       There are several types of adjectives in Kamsá. Most end in -an and can precede or
follow the NP they are modifying. Of the adjectives that end in -an, some are derived from
verbs. Some adjectives can be used both as an adjective with the verb ‘to be’ or can have verbal
morphology. Some can only be used as an adjective, i.e. cannot take verbal morphology. Of the
ones that can only be an adjective (and not take verbal morphology), there is a small subset that
has three unique qualities: [1] they generally precede the noun (rather than following the noun, as
most nouns usually, but not always, do); [2] they do not usually agree with the noun; [3] and they
can be used as compounds. These words are bëts ‘big’ and basa ‘small’.
       All adjectives, however, can be used in compounds, and all adjectives can follow or
precede the noun. All adjectives can agree with nouns in case, class, number, and evaluative
(except when they are functioning as verbs, of course) and all adjectives can be used
substantively as the head an NP. All adjectives must agree with their referent in class when they
are not preceding the noun (i.e. adjectives agree with their referent if they follow their referent or
when their referent is not in the same NP)
       Adjectives derived from verbs behave the same as other adjectives. The following are
some examples of adjectives derived from verbs. It is not clear how productive this derivational
process is, if all verbs can become adjectives. Adjectives derived from verbs are the same as the
verb, but without the initial j-. As with other adjectives, they do not take person, tense, aspect, or
mood markers, but they can take case, number, evaluative, and class markers.(6a)   wabwán ‘cooked’ from j-wabwan ‘to cook’
(6b)   obaná ‘dead’ from jobanan ‘die’The following are two compound nouns with the adjectives basa ‘small’ and bëts ‘big’.(7a)   shembasa ‘girl’ (from shem ‘woman’ and basa ‘small’)
(7b)   bëts mamá ‘grandmother’ (from bëts ‘big’ and mamá ‘mother’)       A subset of adjectives in Kamsá can also be used as verbs. There are perhaps others that
can be verbs, as well, but that have not appeared as verbs in my data. In (8a) joyejwan ‘be happy’
is used as a verb with verbal prefixes for person, number, evidentiality, and aspect. In (8b)
                                                 156
oyejway ‘happy’ is used with the verb ‘be’ and has no verbal prefixes. Instead it has the number
suffix -ëng ‘pl’ as nouns and adjectives do.(8a)    ats̈be enuta botamán tsaba intsoyejwa

        Adjectives agree with their referent whether or not it is present in the phrase. In (9a-b) the
noun and adjective are both in the clause, and both are marked with the class marker (for round
things) -be. The word order is different. In (9c) the referent chembalbe ‘tree tomato’ is not in the
clause at all, but the adjective has the class marker -be to agree with it. (9d) is interesting in that
the entity speaking is round (a lulo fruit) and the adjective botaman has the marker -be to agree
with it. The first person singular pronoun ats̈ is in the clause, referring to the lulo fruit.(9a)    chembalbe tamnabe indemun

7.1     Introduction
        In this chapter, I discuss the function, structure, morphology, and distribution of various
word types that do not fit neatly into other word classes, i.e. words that are not nouns, verbs, or
adjectives. I first discuss adverbs (7.2), including temporal adverbs (7.2.1), adverbs of manner
(7.2.2), and adverbs of degree (7.2.3). In (7.2.4) I discuss some issues for the class of adverbs of
degree. In (7.2) I discuss deictics of place and other words related to location (words that
function as nouns, postpositions, and adjectives). Then I discuss function words and particles,
(7.4), followed by negators (7.5) and quantifiers (7.6).","[166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172]"

        Pronouns can also serve as objects in a verb phrase. They are not marked any differently
from full NP direct objects. In (22a). the object is ats̈ ‘1SG’. Note that the verb agrees with ats̈ in
person and number. The noun ndëts̈-be ‘rock’ is marked with an instrumental case marker. In
(2b), the subject is the first person singular pronoun ats̈. When comparing of (22b) in which ats̈
‘1SG’ is the subject of a transitive clause with (22a) in which ats̈ ‘1SG’ is the object, it can be
seen that the form of the pronoun is the same regardless of whether it is serving as subject or as
object. In (22c), ats̈ ‘1SG’ is the subject of the sentence and has the topic marker -na. When a
pronoun is the direct object of a verb, it does not have to be expressed, as seen in example (20b)
above, in which the verbal prefix k- ‘2SG’ shows that the object is second person singular.(22a) Ch basatem ats̈ s̈onjapega base ndëts̈bemak.

demonstrative mwa is the object of the imperative form of the verb jolempia ‘clean’ (from
Spanish limpiar ‘clean’) and the numeral kanÿe ‘one’ is the object of the verb jasan ‘eat’.","[217, 218]"

3.3.3.1 Unmarked case
       In Kamsá, A, S, and O do not have any overt case marking. The noun stem appears alone
without any affixes. Furthermore, in ditransitives, neither the O or the Goal has any marking.
       In (33a) the A (agent) batá ‘aunt’ has no suffix. In (33b) batá is the P (direct object) and
has no suffix. In (33c) batá ‘aunt’ is the S (subject of the intransitive sentence) and has no affix.
Finally, in (33d), batá is a recipient object of the ditransitive verb and has no case-marking
suffix. Note that the other object sana ‘food’ also has no case marking.",[85]

8.1    Introduction
       This chapter discusses phrase-level syntax in Kamsá. A phrase may be considered a set of
one or more words functioning together as a syntactic unit, a unit usually smaller than (or a
constituent of) a clause. A phrase consists minimally of a single word, but more often contains
multiple words. In Kamsá, there are noun phrases (8.2), verb phrases, (8.3), postpositional
phrases (9.4), and prepositional phrases (8.5). Although prepositional phrases only occur with
Spanish loan words, they are very common in the language. There are some phrase-level clitics,
including the topic marker =na which occurs at the end of a noun phrase (8.2.3.2) and case
marking clitics at the end of noun phrases (8.2.3.1). Case marking is discussed further in (3.3.3).","[203, 204, 205, 206]"

       ‘His soul went to a good, admirable place.’ (Chindoy1 71.17)3.3.3.8 Ablative
       The ablative is the case for motion away from. This is, of course, used most often for
places, but it can be used for other nouns, as well, including animate nouns. Like the other cases,
when it is used with an animate noun, the marker -bi precedes the ablative. The ablative seems to
be a composite of the locative -ok with -an (which is not a marker, as far as I know). In (61a), tja
‘mountain’ has the ablative marker okan and in (61b) yebn ‘house’ has the ablative marker,
ending in -ok-an. In (61c), bata has the ablative marker -ok-an following the animate marker -bi.(61a) ats̈ sëntap tjokan

      1SG 1SG-EVI-VBLZ-go         aunt-ANI-ABL
      ‘I went from my aunt.’ (MC)In (62), chatjok ‘Mocoa’ ends in -okan. Like other nouns that are place names, the city ends in -
ok. Like many place names, chatjok ends in -ok, which is also a locative marker. When used in
the ablative, it does not become chatjokokan (adding -okan to chatjok) but rather chatjok.
Perhaps the ablative is a composite of locative and -an.(62)   ch benach indemën chatjok-an asta bastok.
       ch     benach        i-nd-emën      chatjok-an        asta    bastok

3.3.3.9 Adessive
       There is another case for location at a place: -ents̈. More research is needed to determine
the difference between this case and the locative -ok. In (63a) taban- ‘town, village, Sibundoy’
has the marker -ents̈e for location, and in (63b) kanÿe ‘one’ has the marker -ents̈e to mean ‘in
one place’.(63a) Desde tempskán bëngbe tabanents̈e kanÿe waman kabildo ineysomñe.

      ‘The community obeyed, putting (the material) in one place. (Chindoy2 115:6) (jentna is
      <gentna> in original orthography)3.3.3.10 Illative
       The last noun case, also a form of locative is the illative -iñ. It is used for something
going into something else, as seen in (64) below.","[96, 97, 98]"
"(38)   Carmen-be taita
       carmen-be     taita
       Carmen-GEN father
       ‘Carmen's father'       It can attach to pronouns, as well, which is discussed more extensively in Section 5.1.4.
In (39), the personal pronoun ats̈ has the suffix -be to show possession.
(39)   ats̈-be dios
       ats̈-be         dios

                                                 74
        Finally, the genitive is very productive and can be used with loan words, such as (40)
where the loan word diablo from Spanish diablo ‘devil’ has the genitive marker to show that it is
the story of the devil.(40)    diable-be parlo
        diable-be       parlo
        devil-GEN       story
        ‘story of the devil’ (Chindoy 72.1)3.3.3.3 Benefactive
        The benefactive case expresses that the referent of the noun it marks receives the benefit
of the situation expressed by the clause. The form is -am for inanimate nouns, with allomorph -m
for nouns that end in vowels as seen in (41a) and (41b). In (41a) shknen ends in a consonant and
the benefactive is the suffix -am. In (41b), bomo ‘potato’ ends in a vowel and the benefactive is
realized as -m, presumably after going through the process of deleting a from bomo + -am. The
form *bomoam does not exist.(41a) ch bomo kem shknen-am i ch mntshen inÿa shknen-am
      ch     bomo kem shknen-am i                     ch      mntshen          inÿa shknen-am
      DET    potato DEM plate-BEN             and     DET     meat             other plate-BEN
      ‘The potato (is) for this plate and the meat (is) for the other plate.’ (MC)
(41b) ch tamo kem bomo-m
      ch     tamo kem bomo-m
      DET    salt      DEM     potato-BEN
      ‘The salt (is) for that potato.’        The benefactive is more common with animate nouns and the form is a composite of -bi,
an animate marker, and -am, becoming -byam. This form, -byam does not have other
allomorphs; it is the same for a noun that ends in a vowel as for a noun that ends in a consonant.
In (42a) the noun bata ends in a vowel and has the ending -byam; in (42b), the noun kes̈ ‘dog’
ends in a consonant and has the same ending, -byam.","[87, 88]"

3.3        Other nominal morphology
           Kamsá nouns can have derivational morphology, though it is very limited, mainly to
nominalize verbs, and also evaluatives including diminutive, pejorative, and augmentative. There
is also considerable inflectional morphology, for number and cases. This section discusses the
morphology of nouns, including noun cases, number markers, and diminutives. Noun class                                                  66
markers were discussed above (see 3.2). Some of the morphology was discussed in Chapter 3,
but here it is discussed in more detail, including all of the morphemes and allomorphs and their
uses and meanings.","[79, 80]"
"
1.2.4   Borrowing
        Kamsá has a long tradition of lexical borrowed from both Spanish and Inga. More
recently, as the language has come to be spoken less and less, it has become more and more
influenced by Spanish, both lexically and syntactically. This section focuses more on the older
borrowings, especially those forms that have been fully integrated into Kamsá phonotactics or
have undergone sound changes that have somewhat obscured their non-Kamsá etymologies. The
words considered in this section are—largely—considered by native speakers to be “Kamsá”
(regardless of their origins) and they are used commonly in traditional stories, ceremonial
speech, and other speech registers that may be considered “pure” or “traditional”. Thus, these
are—both etically (on the grounds of phonotactics and morphology) and emically (on the
grounds of speaker identification of Kamsá-ness)—fully integrated loanwords as opposed to
instances of code-switching or language loss.
        One obvious semantic domain for borrowing includes vocabulary for fauna, flora,
cultural objects and concepts that did not exist before the arrival of the Spanish. Examples
include: ral ‘money’ (from Spanish real, the old Spanish currency), naranjabe ‘orange’ (from
Spanish naranja ‘orange’), and jatrabaja ‘work’ (from Spanish trabajar ‘work’). All three of
these words exhibit the borrowed phoneme /r/, which suggests that the forms are foreign.
Nevertheless, their integration into Kamsá can be shown both phonologically and
morphologically. First, ral ‘money’ has undergone a phonological reduction, from the disyllabic                                                  12
form re.al to the current monosyllabic ral (the fact that the term real is no longer used in local
Colombian Spanish can obscure the word’s etymology). Second, the from naranjabe ‘orange’
shows a morphological change, having received the noun classifier associated with round
objects, -be (3.2.2). Finally, jatrabaja has undergone the phonological change of the loss of a
final consonant; furthermore, it reveals Kamsá verbal morphology by exhibiting the non-finite
verb marker j(a)- (4), as well as being able to receive TAM morphology.
       Almost all conjunctions (10.2) in Kamsá are borrowed from Spanish, including: o ‘or’
(from Spanish o); i ‘and’ (from Spanish y); pero ‘but’ (from Spanish pero); porke ‘because’
(from Spanish porque); maske ‘although’ (from Spanish más que ‘more than’); and ni ‘neither,
nor’ (from Spanish ni). Other borrowed basic function-like words include mas ‘more’ (from
Spanish más); mejor ‘better’ (from Spanish mejor); and peor ‘bad’ (from Spanish peor ‘worse’).
These are all discussed in 10.2 and 9.4.
       Because the Catholic missionaries were the only people speaking Spanish in Sibundoy
until the 1950s (Fabre 2001:2), much of the older Spanish vocabulary that has been borrowed
into Kamsá reflects the varieties of Spanish used by the them. Fabre states: “This explains why
the Spanish layer we can detect in Kamsá and Inga is so replete with quaintly old-fashioned
church Spanish” (Fabre 2001:2). Some examples are the following: parla ‘speak’ (from parlar, a
now obsolete Spanish word for ‘speak’, cf. standard hablar); ndeombre ‘truly’ (from Spanish de
hombre loosely, ‘by my word’); andela warda ‘God protect you’ (from Spanish dios le guarde,
‘God preserve you’), dioslepay ‘thank you’ (from (que) dios le pague ‘may God pay you’, cf.
standard gracias).
       Along with vocabulary, Kamsá has borrowed some phonology from Spanish as well
(2.2.2.7). The most obvious loan phoneme is /r/, some examples of which were seen above.
Other examples include rat ‘bit, while’ (from Spanish rato ‘while’) and mor ‘now’ (from
Spanish ahora ‘now’ or, alternatively, from *mwa-hora ‘this hour’, from Kamsá mwa ‘that’ plus
Spanish hora ‘hour’).
       Kamsá’s traditional phoneme inventory also lacked a plain (non-prenasalized) voiced
alveolar /d/, and many older Spanish words that contained /d/ have been borrowed into Kamsá
with either /nd/ or /ndʒ/ (written in orthography used here as <nd> and <nÿ>, respectively).
Examples of Spanish words with *d that have been borrowed with phonological changes into
                                                 13
Kamsá are: nÿios or ndios or nÿios̈ ‘god’ (from Spanish dios ‘god’); ndeolpe ‘suddenly’ from de
golpe ‘suddenly’; and nderado ‘maybe’ possibly from *de raro.
       Many words borrowed from Spanish have changed in meaning, sometimes even
functioning as different parts of speech in Kamsá than in Spanish. Loanwords are pointed out
throughout the dissertation as well as their change in meaning and/or part of speech. Two brief
examples of loanwords that have taken on new meaning in Kamsá are ora ‘when’ and parej
‘with’. First, ora ‘when’ comes from the Spanish nouns hora ‘hour, time, when’, but has become
a subordinator for temporal clauses, thus shifting both in meaning and in function (10.3.3).
Similarly, parej ‘with’ from the Spanish adjective parejo ‘equal to, level with, similar to’
functions in Kamsá as a preposition, not as a adjective.
       Many Spanish words have found new meanings in ceremonial speech, the register of
Kamsá that is used for many formal situations, such as greetings in the cabildo, and for Catholic
sacraments, such as baptisms and confirmations. Haydee Seijas (1969:65), who conducted
anthropological fieldwork in Sibundoy in the 1960s, refers to this type of speech as the lengua de
los antiguos or “relación speech”. She reports that most people are not fluent in this speech,
which consists of set words and phrases and are used by the governor in his Sunday address to
the Kamsá people and by others as a means of showing politeness. The following example, the
beginning of a formal greeting, shows the Spanish influence, with three out of the four words
coming from Spanish (the possessive pronoun ats̈be ‘my’ is the only fully native Kamsá word).
The verb, although derived from Spanish, exhibits Kamsá verbal morphology:(1)    Primermente ats̈be dios chas̈pasentsia …
       primermente ats̈-be            dios cha-s̈-pasentsia
       first             1SG-GEN      god    COND-1SG-forgive
       ‘First may god forgive me…’ (Chindoy 28:5) (primermente from Spanish primeramente
       ‘firstly’, dios from Spanish dios ‘God’, pasentsia from Spanish paciencia ‘patience’)       Much of the ‘formal’ speech relates to the Catholic church, which we might expect to
have a lot of Spanish not because it’s formal but because it involves Catholic rituals and
ceremonies, where they borrowed the words along with the rituals. There is also non-religious
formal speech that uses Spanish, such as the petitioning for a girlfriend, mentioned above.
       In addition to lexical borrowing, Kamsá has perhaps undergone structural changes under
influence from Spanish and Inga. Since Kamsá has no known relatives and since no early                                                 14
documents representing the language are known, it is impossible to say with any certainty what
structural traits (if any) are due to influence from other languages. That said, it is possible that
the basic word order in Kamsá is becoming more SVO (due to influence from Spanish), and that
there is a trend toward using fewer adjectival verbs or null-copular constructions for predicate
adjectives, with a preference instead for copula-plus-adjective constructions (as in Spanish).
Fabre (Fabre 2001:3) suggests another influence from Spanish:   the redundant use of the same classifier, even with no intervening word between them,
   strongly reminds of the Spanish number and gender agreement rules between the same two
   parts of speech and sets Kamsá apart from classifier languages of Western Amazonia, where
   classifiers are mostly used as an anaphoric device, there being no need of repeating the noun
   to which they refer.","[25, 26, 27, 28]"

the TAM prefix) for the past, habitual, and progressive forms, and Ø- (followed by the TAM
prefix) for the future and conditional forms. The second person singular prefix is ko- for all TAM
distinctions. The third person singular prefix exhibits a number of forms depending on tense
distinctions: i- for progressive and future; Ø-, occasionally, for habitual (discussed below); to-
for past; and ye- or yo- for distant past. Finally, the third person singular prefix can also be bo-
(which is the same as the dual prefix 5); this is the case usually only if the clause is transitive and
both the agent and patient are animate. It is important to note that in the future tense, first person
subjects are zero-marked, whereas in other tenses third person subjects are zero-marked.
         There are several options for marking non-singular: with simply plural or dual marking
person prefixes; with plural or dual marking person prefixes in addition to plural or dual marking
5
 It is not clear if the bo- used on transitive verbs when both the subject and object are transitive is the same as the
bo- used on verbs with dual subjects.","[101, 102]"

       Some examples of pronouns with these case markers are seen in the examples to follow.
In (7a), the second person singular pronoun ak is shown with the benefactive marker -byam. In
(7b) the third person singular pronoun cha is show with the comitative marker -abtak. In (7c) the
first person plural pronoun bëng has the genitive marker -be. In (7d) the first person plural
pronoun bëng has the benefactive marker -byam. In (7e) the first person dual pronoun bëndat has
the genitive marker -be. In (7f), the second person plural pronoun tsëngabtang has the
benefactive marker -byam. In (7g) the third person dual pronoun chat has the genitive marker -be
to show that it was the lifeforce of both the people.(7a)   ats̈ sënjwabwa wameshnen akbiam

        In addition to case markers, pronouns can also have the topic marker/discourse marker
=na, as seen above, the intensifier prefix kach-, and evaluatives.
        Pronouns can bear the intensifier prefix; it adds extra emphasis to the pronoun. In (8) the
second singular pronoun ak has the prefix kach and the genitive suffix -be.(8)     kachakbe kausa
        kach-ak-be            kausa
        EMPH-2SG-GEN          cause
        'Because of you' (Chindoy 69.11)        Sometimes pronouns can take evaluatives, although this is very rare and is perhaps only
done for narrative or poetic reasons. In (9), the first person plural pronoun bëng has the suffix -
jem, an evaluative suffix used for poor things. Note that there is an additional plural marker, even
though bëng is already plural.(9)     bngajemunga sasnunga mondemenamse

        Determiners can stand alone without anything else from the NP. When determiners stand
alone, they agree with their referents. In (17a) inÿe ‘other’ has the class marker -be to agree with
ndëts̈be ‘rock’. In (17b) the definite article ch has the suffix for poor things -jem. In (17c), the
definite article has both -jem, the suffix for poor things, and the plural marker.(17a) kem ndëts̈be mas intsewut ch inÿebe

5.5.3      Semantics of determiners
           Kanÿe ‘one’ is used to modify nouns when they are first introduced in a story. However
kanÿe is not necessary; a noun need not have any determiner at all. In the following two
examples, an animal disguises itself as a human to go to a human’s house. In (19a) the animal is
marked with kanÿe and in (19b) the noun has no determiner.(19a) kanÿe tobias̈ bekotem washekwa yejashango kanÿe yebunents̈e
      kanÿe tobias̈ bekotem washekwa ye-j-ashango kanÿe yebun-ents̈e

        Second person plural subjects are indexed on verbs by the prefix s̈mo-. Whereas the use
of this prefix indexes both (second) person and (plural) number, it is possible for a verb agreeing
with a second person plural subject to index just one or the other feature (as is the case with first
person plural subjects, 4.2.4). Thus, a verb that agrees with a second person plural subject can
simply be marked for second person with ko- or for plural with mo-. In (12a) the conquistadors
are telling the Kamsá people that they (the Kamsás) will build a chapel in a certain spot. The
prefix s̈mo- identifies the second person plural subject ‘you (pl)’, otherwise unspecified in the
clause. In (12b) the second person plural pronoun tsëngafta7 is used. (Note: the pronoun is
usually tsëngaftang, as -ang is the plural suffix on nouns, pronouns, verbs, and adjectives.)(12a) Kapilla s̈mochtsebojebuna.

 There are two second person plural pronouns, the more common one being tsëngaftang, as -ang is the plural suffix
on nouns, pronouns, verbs, and adjectives, but both are used.",[110]

        Some verbs, which on semantic grounds seem very much to be transitive, nevertheless
co-occur with nouns (i.e., objects) marked by an oblique case. Such verbs could perhaps be
analyzed as intransitive, but with an argument structure that includes an oblique-marked nominal
argument. Alternatively, they can be analyzed as transitive, but with a (lexically determined)
stipulated selectional restriction that their direct-object arguments must be marked as oblique
NPs. The verb jwajabwachan ‘help’, for example, takes a allative-marked NP as its object. In
(33), the object of jwajabwachan ‘help’ is patronang ‘owners’, here marked with the allative
suffix -bi-oy.","[222, 223]"

clitic =bi-am. In (28b) the direct object is also wameshnen ‘mote’ and the NP ats̈be wampnan

         Kamsá has adverbs of manner, which can be defined as adverbs that tell how something
is done. They have the same form as adjectives, but when they are functioning as adverbs they
are not inflected, and they almost always precede the verb. In other words, when they are
functioning as adverbs, they are not inflected (i.e. do not agree with anything) but when they are
functioning as adjectives, they can agree with the noun in case, class, number, and/or evaluative.
It is not clear if all adjectives can be used adverbially; more research is needed. Figure 7.2
summarizes the adverbs of manner in Kamsá.","[176, 177, 178]"

5: Modifiers precede modified in NPs:
       “A general characteristic of most Andean languages (including Aymaran and Quechuan)
is that modifiers must precede the modified in hierarchically organized noun phrases. In some
languages, however, adjectives follow the noun whereas in other modifiers precede it” (Adelaar
2008:26).
       While determiners and numerals must precede their associated head noun, adjectives can
either precede or follow the head noun.","[42, 43]"
"
18: Nominalizing markers:
       “Andean languages such as Aymaran, Quechuan and Uru-Chipaya have a set of
morphological nominalizations, which may encode relative tense and which can be combined
with case markers to form different types of adverbial clauses and complement clauses. They are
also used to form relative clauses” (Adelaar 2008:30).",[45]

1.4     Previous research on the language
        This dissertation is the first reference grammar of Kamsá. In this section I describe the
history of research on the language and the major earlier contributions. There have been five
major contributors to the documentation and description of Kamsá. Much has been published
about the culture of the people and certain aspects of the language, and there are many Kamsá

texts that have been translated into Spanish and/or English, but there has not yet been a full
grammatical description.
       First, there was Marcelino de Castellví (1908-1951), a Capuchin priest from Spain, who
founded the Centro de Investigaciones Lingüísticas y Etnológicas de la Amazonia Colombiana
(‘Center for Linguistic and Ethnological Research in the Colombian Amazon’, CILEAC). He
wrote several articles about Kamsá including “Bibliografía de la familia lingüística Kamsá”
(‘Bibliography of the Kamsá linguistic family’) (1940).
       Second, Linda Howard, a linguist working for the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL),
spent a number of years living in Sibundoy. SIL was present in the region for almost 30 years,
but with very few publications. Howard published two articles in English and two in Spanish on
the language in the late 1960s: a brief description of the phonology “Camsá phonology” (Howard
1967) and an attempt at explaining verbal inflection from a tagmemic analysis, a theoretical
framework used by SIL linguists in the 1970s: “Camsá: certain features of verb inflection as
related to paragraph types” (Howard 1977).
       Third, in the early 1990s, John McDowell, a folklorist at the University of Indiana,
published So wise were our elders: Mythic narratives of the Kamsá (McDowell 1994), a book of
traditional stories in Kamsá, all translated into English, with extensive commentary. Although an
impressive book and an excellent record of traditional culture, its purpose was not to describe the
morphology or syntax of the language, nor is there any interlinear glossing. He has also written
several articles including “Collaborative Ethnopoetics: The View from the Sibundoy Valley”,
“Discourse Authority in the Sibundoy Valley” (1995), and “The Community-building Mission of
Kamsá Ritual Language” (1990), among others.
       Fourth, in the 1990s, José Narciso Jamioy Muchavisoy, a Kamsá linguist, published a
few articles about the language after completing his Masters in Ethnolinguistics at the
Universidad de los Andes in 1989. Some of his articles are: “Tiempo, aspecto y modo en
kamentsa” (‘tense, aspect, and mood in Kamsá’, 1992), “Estructuras predicativas del kamentsa”
(‘predicative structures of Kamsá’, 1999) and “Observaciones a los documentos de Fray
Marcelino de Castellví sobre la lengua Kamëntsá” (‘Observations on the documents of Father
Marcelino de Castellví about the Kamsá language’, 1999). In addition to these articles, he also
helped translate Colombia’s constitution of 1991 into Kamsá.","[36, 37]"

8.3.3   VPs with obliques
        Verb phrases can also contain obliques—that is, NPs that are marked with case-marked
suffixes but do not play the role of core arguments (subject, object, or object of a distransitive) of
the verb. In (24a) bobonts ‘young man’ bears the allative marker -bioy. In (24b), ndweñang
‘owners’ has the benefactive marker. (Note that ndweñ ‘owner’ is from Spanish dueño ‘owner’;
the initial alveolar stop is prenasalized, following the phonology of Kamsá, imposed by some
speakers on Spanish loan words as well). In (24c), bata ‘aunt’ has the locative marker -bioka.
None of these verb phrases has an expressed direct object.(24a) Ch kaserna bojatjay bobontsbioy:

jajan ‘chagra (small farm)’ marked as locative (jajan loses the final n and becomes jaja + -ok,
then jajok) and taita ‘father’ marked as comitative.","[218, 219]"
"
10.2.1 Conjunctive coordination
        Conjunctive coordination is shown with the conjunction i ‘and’, which has been
borrowed from Spanish y ‘and’. When the conjunction i ‘and’ is placed between two elements,
the two are joined syntactically, with neither element receiving special status or grammatical
                                                  235
marking. When two or more NPs are obliques, they can all have the oblique marker (seen in 1f)
or sometimes only the second NP will have the oblique marker.
       The conjunction i ‘and’ can be used to connect phrases within a clause as well as to
connect clauses within a sentence. In (1a), it connects two NPs, each consisting of a single
common noun: boyabasetemënga ‘boys’ and shembasetemënga ‘girls’. In (1b), the conjunction i
‘and’ connects natjëmban ‘peace’ and silentsio ‘silence’, two NPs used adverbially. In (1c), it
connects two VPs: s̈kotabe ‘I pull it out for you’ and kbochjwebuts̈en ‘I’ll throw it to you’. In
(1d), two clauses are connected: akna benchetema ‘you (are) small’ and ats̈na bëtsá ‘I (am) big’.
there is no verb, however, because the copula can be dropped. In (1e) two clauses are connected.
In (1f) there is coordination between NPs that are marked for case, with the benefactive -am.(1a)   boyabasetemënga i shembasetemënga

        ‘Prepare spots for the people from Popayán, Pasto and Bogotá, and those from the hot
        places.’ (Chindoy 68:6)        As seen in (1a), the conjunction i ‘and’ may be used, in a sense, to add an NP participant
to a clause. Another means of accomplishing this is with the preposition parej ‘together with’.
Unlike i ‘and’, the word parej ‘together with’ does not conjoin two NPs equally; rather, the
second element is marked with either the instrumental suffix -ak for inanimate nouns or the
comitative suffix -byak for animate ones. Although this isn’t a conjunction (it’s a preposition) it
semantically achieves a similar thing.
        Thus, although clearly derived from the Spanish noun parejo ‘equal (to)’, ‘equivalent
(with)’, ‘on a par with’, ‘at the same level (with)’, ‘even’, ‘identical’, the Kamsá word parej
‘together with’ functions as a preposition. In (2a), parej is used twice. In the first instance, it
connects chnungwan te ‘six days’ with ibet ‘night’, meaning ‘six days and (six) nights’; the
second instance functions similarly to express the notion of ‘three days and nights’. In (2b), the
first element of the coordination is not expressed (it is understood to be the 3PL pronoun chëng
‘they’); only the element after parej is overt: the object of the preposition enuta ‘friend’.(2a)    Kanÿe yents̈á bojadesmaya chnungwan te parej ibetak.

         ‘but also they pecked the corn together with friends.’ (Chindoy 90:14)10.2.2 Disjunctive coordination
         Disjunctive coordination in Kamsá is signaled by either the conjunction o ‘or’ (in positive
polarity) or by the conjunction ni ‘neither, nor’ (in negative polarity). Both words are
transparently loans from Spanish.
         Like the conjunctive coordinator i ‘and’, the disjunctive coordinator o ‘or’ can be used to
join two phrases, as in (3a), where it occurs between the numerals unga ‘three’ and kanta ‘four’.
In (3b), the conjunction o ‘or’ joins two NPs (place names), Tëtknaiyay and Chitjianëjay. Note
that only the second place has the locative suffix/clitic. In (3c), it connects two VPs : j-
ojandwon-áy-an ‘roll around’ and j-en-obwast-an ‘scratch oneself’.(3a)     ayekna mobën unga o kanta jajañ jtsepochokayán.

         161:11)28
  The word kabëng (the first plural pronoun with the intensifier ka-) is used to refer to indigenous people, often
Kamsás and Ingas, as opposed to other people. One can say someone is ‘kabëng’ to mean that he or she is
Kamsá/Inga” but you wouldn’t use ka-bëng to talk about you and your friends to do something, unless you’re
emphasizing that the group is indigenous. Thus, this sentence means the priest found the indigenous people there.","[248, 249, 250, 251]"

3.2.11 Suspect class 10: -kwa
       McDowell (1994) posits that -kwa is a classifier for body parts. A few nouns that are
body parts have -kwa in the word, as a bound morpheme, and no non-body part words in the
language have this -kwa. Adjectives that agree with these nouns do not take the suffix -kwa;
however, and thus it does not seem to be a noun class, at least not one parallel to the other noun
classes. In the following sentence, derecha ‘right’ and iskyerda ‘left’ do not have a suffix -kwa to
agree with kukwach ‘hand.’ If -kwa marked nouns formed a true noun class, we would expect
derecha-kwa and iskyerda-kwa for ‘right’ and ‘left’. Because adjectives do not agree with these
nouns, I do not categorize kwa as a noun class marker but rather maybe a frozen suffix.(24)   kanÿe kukwats̈ derecha y kanÿe kukwats̈ iskyerda
       kanÿe kukwats̈        derecha        y      kanÿe kukwats̈              iskyerda
       one     hand          right          and    one   hand                  left
       ‘one right hand and one left hand’ (MC)Other nouns marked with -kwa include the following:matskwas̈: ear
shekwats̈: foot
bwakwats̈: armNote that the nouns with the -kwa morpheme end in slightly different sounds, with matskwas̈
‘ear’ and shekwats̈ ‘foot’ both ending in the retroflex and bwakwats̈ ‘arm’ and kukwats̈ ‘hand’
both ending in the retroflex affricate. This is different from all of the previous class markers,
where the marker is the last suffix without any different consonants following it.

3.3.3.7 Allative
       The allative in Kamsá is marked with -oy on inanimate nouns and -bi-oy on animate
nouns. The allative shows motion toward the noun and sometimes is used when the noun is the
recipient of an action. It is used without any postpositions. With nouns that end in a vowel, the
final vowel is deleted and -oy is added, as seen in (58a) where tja ‘mountain, countryside’
becomes tjoy, not /*tjaoy/ or /*tjay/. Animate nouns, as seen with some of the other cases, take
the suffix -bi before the allative marker -oy. In (58b), batá has the markers -bi and -oy and the
meaning is motion toward.",[95]
