7.1.2.      Oblique Markers         Oblique markers are the special bound formatives that attach to the rightmostnoun or pronoun in phrasal constructions and bear peripheral grammatical relations to thepredicator in the clause. Thus, these oblique markers occur as part of elements that bearthe sort of peripheral grammatical relations generally marked with adpositions inlanguages that have prepositions or postpositions. Like postpositions, these obliquemarkers occur after the forms they attach to; also like postpositions, oblique markersoccur with nouns or with pronouns. However, different from postpositions, they arephonologically attached to a word base. Insofar as they are integrated into themorphological structure of their host base and insofar as they mark peripheralgrammatical relations, oblique markers bear formal and functional resemblance to case-marking affixes in languages with a system of case markers. The next subsections will                                                385
present the meaning/function of oblique markers in terms of the internal structure of theirhosts. The survey of oblique markers presented below covers most of those attested inthe language. There may be a few additional cases, but they require further verification.","[416, 417]"
"5.1.1.2.2      Potentially Ditransitive Verbs       Verbs that translate as ditransitive (i.e. trivalent) verbs in other languages behavelike regular transitive verbs in Apurinã insofar as only the subject and one object arestructurally required to occur, and the third argument is structurally optional (i.e. the thirdargument can be omitted without making the clause ungrammatical). The examples in(17) illustrate the general case, namely that verbs that translate as ditransitive verbs insome other languages, in this case as ‘to teach’ and as ‘to tell’ in English, behave asregular transitive verbs in Apurinã (parentheses indicate that the expression is structurallyoptional in the clause in which it occurs):
 17a. mipake owara-pira-ta-ru          u-sãkire (pita-monhi)
      Mipake teach-language-3M.O 3M-language.of 2SG-GOAL
      ‘Mipake taught his language (to you).’   b. nota sãpire-ta-ru           tsora sãkire (youkake-monhi)
      1SG tell-VBLZ-3M.O Tsora language.of Youkake-GOAL
      ‘I told the Tsora story (to Youkake).’As shown in (17), the argument expressing the “theme” is obligatory and occurs as theobject of the verb, expressed by a “caseless” noun phrase, while the recipient argument isoptionally expressed by an “oblique” noun phrase. For the present purposes of thissection, a “caseless” noun phrase can be informally defined as a noun phrase without anymorphological case marker, whereas an “oblique” noun phrase can be described (alsoinformally) as a noun phrase marked with an oblique (case) marker. The description ofnoun phrases will take place under 9.3.",[318]
"       As to the boundary factor, there is one clear instance where phonological rules thatapply at the boundary of phonological words but not at the boundary of a particular type ofgrammatical words. This is the case of the shortened form of the independent pronoun forfirst person singular nota, i.e. no#. As was described in chapter 2, subsections 2.1.2.5 andunder 2.5, /h/ is deleted in postvocalic environments. As was illustrated in 2.1.2.5, andrepeated below in (8), the /h/-deletion rule only fails to apply when /h/ is preceded by theshortened form of the independent pronoun nota, i.e. no#:
8a. [nota himarota]                        ‘I know’b. [i-imarota]                            ‘I know’c. [no#himarota]                            ‘I know’d. [o-imarota]                             ‘she knows’
I should also note that although it is the case that all independent pronouns can also beshortened, no# is the only shortened pronominal form that occurs systematically enough andindependently of speech rate.",[158]
"       In view of the introduction of the FRt versus BRt2 distinction, the WFRs for nounstems need to be partly revised as follows: (Although an analogous BRt versus FRtoposition can be made for verbal roots, such a distinction will be ignored here, as it willbe described later in chapter 5, under 5.1.)       Inalienable non-classificatory nouns have free roots, i.e.:
107. NStINAL.NON-CL → FRtINAL-NON-CL (+ txi)
      Inalienable classificatory nouns have free roots, i.e.:
108. NStINAL.CL → BRt.INAL.CL (+ txi)
       All alienable noun stems have either a free noun root or, in the case of some ofthose marked by -re1, a verb base, as represented by the WFR in (109):

         Productive noun compounds (also in the cases attested so far) have free roots, i.e.:
112. NSt → FRt + CN (+ CN)
         All noun stems morphologically marked for gender have a bound root where themasculine, i.e. -ru, and the feminine, i.e. -ro, gender markers can occur, as represented in(113):

(yet) part of the grammatical system of noun stem formation. Augmentative/diminutivefunctions in the language are expressed as extensions of the meaning of morphemes withother grammatical functions.","[287, 288, 289]"
"       In contrast to languages that require a determiner in order for the noun to functionas the syntactic expression of a verbal argument, in Apurinã nouns can stand bythemselves (without any determiner) as the sole nominal expression of a subject or anobject. In the following examples hãtako-ro ‘youth-F’, and ximaku ‘fish’ are instances ofnouns that can stand by themselves as the nominal expression of notional subject andobject, respectively:
                                               456
29a. o-su-pe          hãtako-ro
     3F-go-PFTV youth-F
     ‘The girl left.’   b. hãtako-ro nhika-ru ximaku
      youth-F     eat-3M.O fish
      ‘The girl ate fish.’   c. ximaku o-muna hãtako-ro
      fish      3F-bring youth-F
       The girl brought fish.’
       There are some preliminary indications that in some Apurinã speech varieties thedemonstrative forms constitute a subclass of independent pronouns, insofar as they canstand by themselves as a noun phrase. If further investigation confirms the existence ofpronominal demonstratives in those speech varieties, the NP structure will need to berevised accordingly for those speech varieties, since in such cases demonstratives wouldconstitute instances of pronouns.","[487, 488]"
"Apurinã also has affix-like forms that occur outside of the morphological formativesinherent to nouns. The majority of such morphological forms belonging to this outer-layer morphology can occur not only with nouns but, also, with verbs, pronouns and/orother closed word classes (depending on the relevant case). In this chapter, I willconcentrate on the description of inherently nominal bound formatives, postponing thedescription of non-inherently nominal affix-like forms to chapter 7, where they will bedescribed as a special class of bound formatives.",[180]
"
3.5.1      Affixes        Affixes are the bound formatives used individually or as part of a paradigm toencode grammatical categories generally associated with a specific word class. Differentaffixes can precede (as prefixes) or (exclusively) follow (as suffixes) the word base theyattach to, but no affix can interrupt (as an infix) a formative. The plural suffix -wako-ruillustrated in (4) and the nominalizer suffix -re illustrated in (10b) are instances of typicalaffixes. There is one instance of an affix combination that may be analyzed as a circumfix(or a discontinuous morpheme), namely the forms involved in marking third person plural,u-... -na; however, I will also consider the possibility of describing this potential case ofcircumfix as an instance of discontinuous dependencies (Spencer 1991:210), a notion                                                 137
independently motivated in the language by a specific subset of verbal formatives.","[168, 169]"
"
7.1.6.      Perfectivity Marking: -pe, -panhi         There are two perfectivity markers that can attach to noun bases, pronoun basesor verb bases, namely the perfective and imperfective aspectual markers. One can arguethat aspectual markers should NOT be considered as part of the noun or pronounmorphology, since the scope of such a marker is the event/state rather than the referent of
                                                394
the noun or pronoun in question. Or, conversely, one can argue that word bases takingperfectivity markers are not noun or pronoun forms since they take marking formsassociated with the event/state expressed in the verb. Although, in a general sense, botharguments could be correct in other languages (or in Apurinã under a different view ofthe domain of morphology), the fact is that the word forms described below as takingaspectual markers fit the definition of grammatical words given in chapter 3, regardlessof their translation into English. In other words, there is no reason to think thatperfectivity markers make a noun or a pronoun into a verb. In the following subsection, Iwill merely illustrate some examples of noun, pronoun and verb bases marked withperfectivity markers. I will return to the discussion of perfectivity markers in chapter 8,in 8.6.2, where I will provide a more detailed description of the semantics of perfectivitymarkers. In translating clauses marked with perfectivity markers, I will use the Englishperfective form have V-ed to translate the perfective marking, and the English formstill/yet to translate the imperfective marking. Although this does not constitute a“perfect” translation of the perfectivity markers, it covers some of their most typicalmeanings —which will be described in detail in chapter 8.6.2.","[425, 426]"
"            The fact that objective descriptive verbs share properties typologically associatedwith both verbs and adjectives in some other languages suggests that to use either label inthis case may be more of an arbitrary convention than anything reflecting categoricaldistinctions in the grammar.16 What the descriptive facts reveal is that property-referringwords are more “verbal-like” than “nominal-like” in Apurinã, both in terms of their formsand behavior. Thus, in this sense, Apurinã is different from languages such as, e.g.,Portuguese, where property-referring words share more characteristics with nouns thanwith verbs.",[375]
"       Other properties that can help in distinguishing nouns from other syntacticcategories include the morphological distinctions provided in 4.5, under the assumptionthat “[l]exical category [i.e., part of speech] is as much of a notion of morphology as oneof syntax, in that what an item is inflected for provides sufficient grounds for assigning itto a lexical category” and that, therefore, “[t]he differences in syntactic behavior of thedifferent lexical categories serve in part to allow compliance with morphologicalrequirements.” (McCawley 1988:183). The qualification “in part”, however, is animportant one since not all morphological marking properties have syntacticconsequences, or, as was shown in chapter 7, not all morphological marking propertiesthat are syntactically relevant are sensitive to the parts of speech distinctions (althoughone can argue whether the latter cases really constitute part of the morphology rather thansolely of syntax). Finally, the last set of properties that can distinguish nouns from other
                                                 267
parts of speech consists of the way they can combine with other words in phrasalconstructions and the way they can stand by themselves as a phrase. These last propertieswill be described in detail in 8.3.1.","[298, 299]"

       When these tripartite morphemic clusters are contrasted to the way languagesgenerally mark ClRELs, they are found to be somewhat comparable to the relativepronouns commonly found in European languages (Keenan 1985:149-152, Comrie1989: 149-150, Givón 1990:656-658). Similar to relative pronouns, relative pronominalmarkers in Apurinã occur inside the ClREL indicating the role of the headREL, andfunctioning as subordinators. So, for example, the pairs -k-a-r-u/r-o vs. -k-u-t-u/t-o, inApurinã, and who vs. whom, in English, are both relative pronominal forms that occurinside the ClREL, marking the headREL as subject and object respectively. The differences
                                                 592
between these two pairs are in their phonological status (as bound vs. free forms), in thenumber of functional properties they encode (i.e. grammatical relation, voice, polarity,number and gender in Apurinã vs. grammatical relation and animacy in English), in theirposition inside the ClREL (i.e. following the verb in Apurinã vs. initial in the ClREL inEnglish), and, finally, in that only the Apurinã forms can also mark headless ClRELs.","[623, 624]"
"                                                             254
4.4.10 Distribution of Affixes and Generalized Noun Stem FormationRules        The purpose of this subsection is to present the generalizations in terms of whichthe structures involved in noun stem formation can be described. Before presenting thegeneral rules for forming noun stems, some labels need to be introduced in order tofacilitate some contrasts to be noted in the noun structure. In the noun stem formationrules described in the previous subsections we have seen that certain noun stems canconsist of a single root with no further morphological marking. Such is the case of somesimple alienable nouns such as kanawa ‘canoe of’, which follows the word formation rule(hereafter WFR) NSt → RtALIEN (+te), which states that noun stems can consist of analienable root plus the possessed marker -te. This is also the case of inalienable nounstems such as kuwu ‘head of’, which follows the WFR NSt → RtINAL (+ txi), which statesthat noun stems can consist of an inalienable root (i.e. belonging to the class ofinalienable roots) plus the inalienable marker -txi. In both cases the root forms can standby themselves as a noun, and they will be hereafter referred to as free roots (abbreviatedto FRt). Hence, both WFRs will be rewritten as NStALIEN → FRtALIEN.te (+te) andNStINAL → FRtINAL (+ txi), respectively.","[285, 286]"
"       A brief illustration of the notions just introduced can be seen in (10). The formnhipoko ‘food’ in (10a) is shown to be the minimal base a word can be decomposed into, i.e.a root. (10b) shows that the category changing nominalizer (and possessed marking) suffix-re can attach to the root base to form another noun form. In (10c), we can see that acategory maintaining suffix, in this case the instrumental marker -ã ,can attach to the root+reword base to form a noun “inflected” as an instrument. The base root+re which theinstrument marker attaches to is then an instance of a stem.
10a. *ata [nhipoko]ROOT                            (our food; we eat)
    1PL foodb. ata [nhipoko]ROOT –re                           ‘our food’
   1PL food-POSSEDc. ata [nhipoko-re]STEM –ã                         ‘in our food’
   1PL food-POSSED-INSTR
       The examples in (10) are a simplified illustration of the way the morphologicalnotions introduced here help to describe the grammar internal to word forms. A much moredetailed description is presented in chapters 4-7, including subtypes of root and stem formsnot discussed here.",[167]
"       The semantic development of CNs suggests a number of semantic changes thatcan be explained through metaphorical extensions of particular source meanings intoparticular target meanings. One type of semantic change observed was that which occurswhen plant parts have their meaning extended to refer to body parts. In contrast, anothersemantic change occurs with the extension of meaning from plant parts to manufacturedelements. For instance, there is a sense in which the use of -muna in ãã-muna ‘tree’ isdifferent from its use in kiri-muna ‘animal’s nose’; and the use of -muna in aiko-muna‘house bean’ is different from both of the previous uses. In the first case, -muna refers tothe properties of a plant; in the second case, -muna refers to the properties of a body part;and in the third case, -muna refers to the properties of a manufactured element. Is it thecase that, in the three cases, -muna carries the same meaning properties? If yes, thenwhat are these meaning properties? Are the various uses of -muna a case of polysemy orhomonyny?",[220]
"The terminology used is this section is primarily based on Campbell 1999:111-112.         327 words were examined, including body parts, kinship terms, various animal and plant names,descriptive and grammatical words, among others. There were a total of 122 cognate sets shared by API,56 shared by Apurinã and Piro (but not by Iñapari), 28 shared only by Apurinã and Iñapari (but not by
                                                         658
Piro), and 12 shared by Piro and Iñapari (but not by Apurinã). The 122 cognate sets represent 39% ofshared lexical (i.e. vocabulary) retention in API. Although such a vocabulary similarity confirms earliersuspicion that API are closely related and may descend from a proto-language, i.e. API, as part of anintermediary branch of Arawak, shared lexical similarities alone cannot be used to show how closelyrelated to one another these three languages are, nor can they be used to prove that API indeed form asubgroup of Arawak. Table 1 (where Ø marks the cases where the reflex of the proto-sound isphonologically null, i.e. absent, in the vocabulary item in question) gives only a partial list of the cognatesets illustrating the most obvious sound correspondences that were used to reconstruct a preliminarysegmental inventory for P-API. From left to right, the first column of Table 1 provides the English gloss ofthe cognate sets given in the second, third and fourth columns for Apurinã, Piro and Iñapari, respectively;whereas the fifth column gives the reconstructed proto-sounds for P-API. These reconstructed forms areeasily arrived at when their reflexes remain the same in all the sister languages, as shown by most of thesound correspondences given in the table above. So, for example, in the cognate set pekiri:pexØri:pehiri‘agouti’, since the word initial sound p remains constant in the same environment across the three itemsbeing compared, *p can be posited as the ancient (proto-sound) which the reflexes p:p:p descend from. Inother cases, however, a number of sound changes needs to be posited in order to determine which proto-sound will be reconstructed. For example, in the cognate set koti:koti:Øotí ‘rat’, the word initial phonemek is found both in Apurinã and in Piro, respectively, but the same phoneme is absent in the word initialposition in Iñapari in pretty much the same environment (where the absence of the phoneme is representedby Ø). Since the odds are that it is more likely that one language alone changed, while the other two didnot, rather than the reverse (there being no evidence to the contrary), and since the dropping of a consonantis quite common as a historical phonological process (i.e. more common than the addition of it) acrosslanguages, we can posit that in the correspondence set k:k:Ø, *k was originally found in P-API, and thatthis original sound was preserved in Apurinã and in Piro, but *k was dropped in word initial environment inIñapari. In fact, to give a more complete picture, *k was preserved (as k) in all environments in Apurinã (as

"These are the cases of nouns ending in forms phonologically similar to either of themorphological gender markers but that cannot be segmented into separate morphemes onthe basis of the morphological structure of the language, despite the fact that speakers’interpretation of the gender for such nouns may, in some cases, agree with theinterpretation that would follow if the phonological ending were analyzable as a separatemorpheme. For example, the word txipokoru ‘fruit’ ends in /ru/. As the next exampleshows in (68), this noun triggers the masculine (rather than feminine) coreferentialmarking in the predicate:
68. posẽtaka-ru     txipokoru
    yellow-3M.O fruit.M
    'The fruit is ripe.'",[254]
"
        As it is also clear from the examples above, the bases to which morphologicalgender markers attach are all bound roots. So, for instance, the noun stem hãtako-ru1means ‘boy’ and the noun stem hãtako-ro means ‘girl’, but the form *hãtako cannotstand by itself as noun to mean ‘youth’ (or whatever) because it is a phonologicallybound root. Hence, hãtako- is a bound root. The same observation applies to all other

        There is one ditransitive verb, i.e. suka ‘to give (away)’, however, that differsfrom regular transitive verbs in two main ways. There are two special properties to benoted about the Apurinã verb suka that make it a special case of transitive verb: The firstproperty is that only this ditransitive verb allows a third argument (representing therecipient) to be expressed by a caseless noun phrase. So, for example, in (18) acomparison is made between the verb for suka and etuka ‘to look’, where the former isthe special case of a transitive verb (i.e. a potentially ditransitive transitive verb) and thelatter is the typical case of transitive verbs (i.e. a regular transitive verb) in Apurinã:
 18a. nhi-yowata-ne          pita nota suka
      1SG-knife-POSSED 2SG 1SG give
      ‘I gave you my knife.’   b. *i-yowata-ne         pita nota etuka
      2M-knife-POSSED 2SG 1SG look
      (I watched/looked over his knife for him.)
In (18a), where pita ‘2SG’ and nhi-yowata-ne (1SG-knife-POSSED) ‘my knife’ are,respectively, recipient and “theme” arguments, both (recipient and “theme”) argumentsare expressed by noun phrases, whereas (18b) is ungrammatical.","[318, 319]"

       The repetition of the same CN2 incorporated and non-incorporated resembles therepetition that is characteristic of agreement markers. But, different from typicalagreement markers, the repetition of the same classificatory noun in a clause isstructurally optional, as shown by (40). Therefore, both the properties of “doubling” ofICNs and of its being used anaphorically distinguish verbs with incorporated CN2s fromverbs with incorporated regular nouns. If there is a possibility (still to be conclusivelydetermined) that incorporated regular nouns may function as the grammatical object, nosuch possibility exists for CN2s. This is the case because CN2s cannot actually replacethe object they modify. In the cases where a CN2 is incorporated and the notional objectit modifies is not overtly expressed in the clause as an external nominal expression (as in40a” and in 41a”), a pronominal marker coreferential with the nominal object is found inthe verb. Although ICNs require a morphological description (as do incorporated regular
                                                303
nouns), since they occur as part of a grammatical word, occupying a morphologicallydefined position class in the verb (as will be further described under in the next section),the interaction of incorporated CN2s with other words inside and outside the same clausegives them a potential syntactic relevance that is worth of further investigation.","[334, 335]"

            The primary overt-coding distinction that can be used to characterize subject isthe (bound) pronominal marking system already mentioned in various parts of theprevious chapters (particularly in 5.2.2.1.1.1, 5.2.2.1.1.11, 7.1.2, and in Table 5 in section7.2.1.2). In the examples in (49) the underlined elements are the pronominal markersplus their corresponding (co-referential) subject NP. In (49a), for instance, thepronominal marker prefixed to the verb is n-, which is co-referential with the post-verbalindependent pronoun nota for first person singular. The other examples in (49) illustratethe same for the different grammatical persons:9
     O      s-V      S
49a. pite n-atama-ta   nota
     2SG 1SG-see-VBLZ 1SG

    In some speech varieties speakers hesitate or simply do not accept the use of some free subject pronominal
     expressions post-verbally even if the coreferential pronominal marker is present in the verb. The reasons for this
     restriction require further investigation, the restriction does not apply uniformly to all the independent pronouns. In
     the Fortaleza village, for example, one speaker rejected (49c,e,g), hesitated before accepting (49f), but accepted all
     other cases.","[504, 505]"
"                                                                       349
       Independent pronouns can replace nominal constructions functioning as the syntacticexpressions of subject/object or the possessor. The structure and distribution of such nominalconstructions will be described in chapter 8, in 8.1. Various examples given above can be usedto illustrate the use of pronouns as words replacing nominal constructions. For example, thenoun form hãtako-ro ‘girl’ in (4) can be replaced by its pronominal counterpart owa ‘3SG.F’ in(5):
 4a. hãtako-ro umaka-nanu-ta
     youth-F sleep-PROG-VBLZ
     ‘The girl is sleeping.’  b. hãtako-ro unuro       iri-pe
     youth-F      mother fall-PFTV
     ‘The girl’s mother has fallen down.’
 5a. owa      umaka-nanu-ta
     3SG.F sleep-PROG-VBLZ
     ‘She is sleeping.’  b. owa     unuro iri-pe
     3SG.-F mother fall-PFTV
     ‘Her mother has fallen down.’
Pronouns differ syntactically from nouns in that they do not subcategorize for the things nounssubcategorize for, except for gender —which third person singular pronouns also distinguish (aswas earlier illustrated in 1c-d, 2c-d, and 3c-d). Another difference (which will be furtherdescribed in the discussion on the structure of noun phrases in 8.1.1) is that a pronoun cannot bethe possessed head element of a possession construction, as indicated by the ungrammaticality of(6):
6. *hãtako-ro owa     iri-pe
   youth-F 3SG.F fall-PFTV
   ‘(The woman’s it/her has fallen down.)’                                                   350
       The use of independent pronouns is determined by either grammatical or discoursefactors, or by a combination of both. Example of a grammatical factor is the oblique nounphrases (described in chapter 8, in 8.1.1.2. Since oblique noun phrases are generally markedwith an oblique marker (see 7.1.2), and since oblique markers can attach to phonologicallyindependent elements only, independent pronouns but not pronominal markers can occur with anoblique marker. So, while the example in (7a) is grammatical, the one (7b) is ungrammaticalbecause, in the latter, the associative oblique marker -kata (see 7.1.2.2) occurs with a boundpronominal marker, rather than with an independent pronoun.
 7a. uwa-kata          n-una-ru
    3SG.M-ASSOC 1SG-come-3M.O
    ‘I came with him.’  b. *u-kata        n-una-ru
      3M-ASSOC 1SG-come-3M.O
      (‘I came with him.’)
       The discourse factors that determine the use of independent pronouns cannot be describedin any detail in this work for two reason: first because the discourse structure of Apurinã will notbe dealt with here and, second because preliminary evidence suggests that there is no one or twodiscourse factors that can account for the use of independent pronouns in discourse, but insteadthere various discourse categories that need to be taken into account. What I will do then is tolist some of the most obvious discourse factors that have been observed, and which can be foundin the text given in Appendix B. While reproducing examples from Appendix B, for easy ofillustration, I will preserve the numbering and format given there.","[380, 381, 382]"
"       Both of the discourse roles played by CN2s in productive compounding,disambiguating and highlighting meanings, are also attested for CN2 incorporation. Forexample the word for ‘manioc mush’ is attested in texts as the productive compounding
                                               180
komuru-pe, in which case -pe not only qualifies the ‘mushy’ and ‘paste’ consistency ofthe ‘manioc mush’, but it also discriminates ‘manioc mush’ from ‘manioc bulb’, ‘manioctree’ etc. Approximately the same disambiguating or attributive function can beaccomplished by simply incorporating the CN2 -pe into the verb; as in the examplebelow:
41. (komeru(-pe))     ata oka-pe-ta
     manioc(-pulp of) we throw-pulp-VBLZ
    ‘We thrown the (manioc) mush in.’
The fact that the noun to which the verb incorporated CN2 refers can be omitted, andmost often is, suggests that, when CN2 incorporation is used somewhat anaphorically, thediscourse participant whose properties the incorporated CN2 refers to is BACKGROUNDDISCOURSE INFORMATION. Another piece of evidence for this discourse property isthe fact that incorporated CN2s are widely used to make reference to discourseparticipants mentioned repeatedly in the same text. Finally, there are many cases inwhich a subset of incorporated CN2s narrow the meaning of the verb. For example, theverb yatarota by itself means ‘to mix’; but when the CN2 for liquid things, a, isincorporated, as in yataro-a-ta, the meaning becomes ‘to stir a liquid thing’. Thus, thefunction of CN2s when incorporated approximates the function of what Mithun (1986a,1986b, 1984) describes as incorporated classifiers (or verbal classifiers). Thissimilarity to a certain type of classifier, however, does not hold grammatically whenCN2s are used in nominal compounding (see 4.2.1).","[211, 212]"
"                                                              152
 b. [kuwĩ-txi]           su-pe
     head.of-UNPOSS go-PFTV
     ‘The head person left.’ (In this case ‘head’ refers to a mythological personage who only
     exists as a head, with no other body parts.)
        In (4), as everywhere else in this work, inalienable nouns are glossed as ‘N of’,where “N” is the lexical meaning of the inalienable noun in question and “of” marks it asobligatorily possessed. Thus, in the analysis proposed here, obligatory possession is partof the lexical entry of inalienable nouns; that is, it is stored with the lexical entries ofinalienable nouns, rather than added by morphosyntactic rules. As seen (4a), nomorphological marker is added when an inalienable noun occurs possessed, and, as aconsequence, the syntactic context in which inalienable nouns occur possessed is onewhere two nouns are placed together by juxtaposition. On the other hand, wheninalienable nouns occur unpossessed they require the presence of the unpossessionmarker -txi:        The example given in (4) may suggest that possession constructions such as[kema kuwu] can be described purely in terms of the syntactic structure internal to thenominal phrase. In this case, the possession relation would not be marked by any lexicalproperty of the possessed noun but, instead, by a syntactic distribution in which thepossessor would always precede the possessed noun. However, while this “precedencerule” is a necessary part of the grammar of possession constructions in the language, it isnot sufficient to describe them. The reason is a twofold one: First, it is necessary to referto the lexical property of inalienable nouns in order to describe which ones take theunpossessed suffix -txi; second, it is necessary to refer to their lexical property also inorder to explain why they do not take the possessed suffixes described below foralienable nouns.","[183, 184]"

            AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF       Sidney da S. Facundes     for the degree of     Doctor of Philosophy       in the Department of Linguistics to be taken January 2000               Title: THE LANGUAGE OF THE APURINÃ PEOPLE OF BRAZIL       (MAIPURE/ARAWAK)       A somewhat typologically informed grammatical description of the Apurinãlanguage is provided, including historical, socio-cultural, demographic and geographicinformation about the Apurinã society. The Apurinã communities spread alongtributaries of the Purus River, in western Brazilian Amazon. The grammatical analysisconsists of the phonology, morphology and syntax, with appendixes on languagevariation and the design of the Apurinã ortography, a text sample, a vocabulary list, and apreliminary reconstruction of Proto-Apurinã-Piro-Iñapari. The grammatical analysis isbased on language internal factors, though with some typological observations on majoraspects. The segmental phonology is simple; morphophonemic alternations are restrictedto pronominal subject/possessor markers and a few other bound morphemes. Stress ispredictably penultimate, though with exceptions that need further investigation.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"
"       At the present time I have found few cases illustrating the restriction on themodification of possessed nouns. However, although it will be important to verifyadditional data with more speakers in order to determine the generality of the restrictionon the modification of possessed elements as a grammatical constraint in the language,there is at least one independent grammatical factor that could help to motivate thisrestriction. The possessed element in a possession construction cannot be directlymodified by anything other than the possessor (pro)nominal form. That is, a possessednoun cannot be immediately preceded by anything other than the possessor (pro)nominalform (including here the pronominal possessor markers). So, the constructions in (24)are ungrammatical because the modifier, the numeral in (24a) and the demonstrative in(24b), occur inside a possession construction, immediately preceding the possessed noun:
 24a. *mipa epi serepi
       Mipa two arrow.of
      (Mipa’s two arrows…)
      (two arrows of Mipa’s…)   b. *mipa i-kira     aiko-te
       Mipa F-DIST house-POSSED
      (that Mipa’s house…)
      (that house of Mipa’s…)
Since modifiers cannot occur immediately before a possessed noun (nor after it), theyneed to precede the possessor form which, in its turn, precedes the possessed noun.",[484]
"       Having introduced the labels above, I will now summarize the sort of properties thatwill be considered relevant for the identification of formatives in the language. As was thecase for words, morphemes can also be described in terms of their form and meaning. In theideal cases each morphemic form will correspond to a specific meaning, so that the idealmorphemes will consist of a particular form that is consistently associated with one specificmeaning. This is the so-called one-to-one mapping between form and meaning (Anderson1988:151-153). If, however, all there was to a morphological description was thedescription of one-to-one mappings between the forms and meanings of various formativesthere would probably be no reason to even describe morphology separately from syntax. Insome cases it is not easy to decide whether certain forms constitute allomorphs of the samemorpheme, different morphemes, or whether they even are segmentable formatives at all. Itis precisely because many other factors may be involved in the identification of formatives,aside from the form-meaning mapping, that I will make use of a list of factors which willconstitute useful guidelines in the identification of morphemes. The list of factors used herefollows partly from an extrapolation of the properties described in Bauer 1994, chapter 8, asthose identifying affixes and bases. The properties to be considered in the identification offormatives are then as in (9):
9a. meaning of a putative formative;b. function of a putative formative (verbalizer, nominalizer etc);c. (phonological) form of a putative formative;d. part of speech of the word base (noun, verb etc.) that a putative formative attaches to;                                               130
e. phonological, grammatical or semantic restrictions on the word base that a putative
   formative attaches to;f. range of allomorphs displayed by a putative formative;g. form a putative formative imposes to the word base;h. whether a putative formative is required before another formative can occur in the same
   word base, i.e. whether it potentiates a subsequent formative;i. degrees of productivity of a putative formative;j. whether a putative formative occupies a position class in the base;k. whether a putative formative is in complementary distribution with another one;l. recurrence of a putative formative.","[161, 162]"
"The second is that various of the examples above also show that a noun (or pronoun) canbe the only element within a bare NP. The control of inflecting properties, then, can beused to motivate the category head of a NP, and nouns and independent pronouns are theelements that can head a NP. Hence, following the “head rule as internal structure testfor phrase class” given in (15), the presence of a noun or pronoun head constitutes apositive evidence of a NP. Also, following the “internal structure test for phrase class”given in (13), the presence of a numeral or demonstrative (as elements internal to NPs)will count as positive evidence of NPs —insofar as wherever one finds a demonstrativeor a numeral, one will also find a NP.",[487]
"
       Therefore, the Apurinã independent pronouns differ from languages like English, since inEnglish independent pronouns are generally required in the absence of a coreferential nounphrase, while in Apurinã they can be replaced with coreferential bound markers in theappropriate grammatical and discourse-pragmatic contexts. On the other hand, theseindependent pronouns also different from the ones in a language such as Portuguese, since inPortuguese the only conditioning factor for the occurrence of independent pronouns is, ingeneral, discourse pragmatics. The result of the characteristics of independent pronouns inApurinã then is that they occur a lot less frequently in texts than the English pronouns, but moreoften than the Portuguese ones.",[386]
"       Finally, an analysis of all special bound formatives as bound words which lack a(phonologically) free corresponding form is, in principle, possible, though, as I willsuggest, undesired. Since all special bound formatives require a host base to lean on, andsince they all lack a corresponding free form, they all resemble bound words (except forthe still unclear “passive” marker). That is, (quasi-)floating special bound formativesresemble bound words in that they can occur in two or more host bases; the objectmarkers, though constituting a non-floating special bound formative, resemble a boundword in that they are in complementary distribution with pre-verbal coreferential objectfree expressions; and, the gerund marker resembles a bound word in that it marks a wholeclause as subordinate, rather than just the verb itself, thus, in a way analogous to freecomplementizers in some other languages. The fact, however, is that clear cases ofbound words were presented in chapter 4 as a subset of classificatory nouns. So, aclassificatory noun such as ku ‘seed, kernel; small and roundish’ behaves like a noun inthe language in that it can take a possessed marker such that u-ku [3M-seed/kernel] willmean ‘its/his seed/kernel’. As was shown in chapter 4, only nouns can take pronominal
                                                 437
markers functioning as possessors. However, ku is different from typical nouns in that itcan never stand by itself as a free word form, thus behaving as a noun that isphonologically bound. Special bound formatives, on the other hand, can never take apossessed marker.","[468, 469]"
"
7.1.11.    Focus Marking: -ra       The focus marker -ra is used to mark focus of attention constructions, such that,e.g., N-ra translates into English as ‘it’s N that’. Thus, noun bases or pronoun basesmarked with -ra are generally translatable into English as cleft constructions (e.g., asillustrated for English in Givón 1990:704), as the examples in (34) show. (34a-c)illustrate -ra with noun bases, and (34d-e) illustrate -ra with pronoun bases:
 34a. kopiti-ka4-ra          o-kama
      bucket-PRED-FOC 3F-make
      ‘It’s the bucket that she made.’   b. maku-putu-ka4-ra               n-apoka
      Brazil.nut-EMPH-PRED-FOC 1SG-find
      ‘What I found was indeed Brazil-nut.’   c. katarokuru-nanu-ra
      manioc.flour-RESTR-FOC
      ‘(It’s) only manioc flour...’   d. a-serota-re-kata-nanu-ra
      1PL-salt-POSSED-ASSOC-RESTR-FOC
      ‘(It’s) only our salt...’   e. uwa-ka4-ra
      3SG.M-PRED-FOC
      ‘It’s him!’   f. nota-ka4-ra
      3SG.M-PRED-FOC
      ‘It’s me!’
       Notice that the fact that N-ra and PRO-ra constructions in (34) (as in all otherexamples of N-ra and PRO-ra constructions) translate into predicates in English does not                                                405
necessarily mean that they constitute (verbal) predicates in Apurinã. In fact, V-raconstructions do NOT constitute verbal predicates, although they (as any other nominalconstruction) can be used as non-verbal predicates in the language (see chapter 8,subsection 8.4.2) or be marked as predicate with the predicate marker -ka4, as in (34a-b,e-f). N-ra and PRO-ra constructions could as well be translated with a special intonationin a language that makes use of intonation to mark focus of attention.","[436, 437]"
"       Perhaps to compensate for the simplicity of the phonological system of thelanguage, its morphology is extremely rich. Bound morphemes abound in the language,especially in the verb, with a great variety of functions. Due to this typologicalcharacteristic of this language with respect to its morphological system, five chapters (3-                                                 613
7) were spent describing, respectively, a general introduction to morphology, the nounmorphology, verb morphology, closed word class morphology, and special boundmorphology. It is this richness in morphological forms and their specific functions thatgive Apurinã characteristics associated with so-called polysynthetic languages. Nounsand verbs can be independently motivated as distinct parts-of-speech on morphological aswell as syntactic grounds. Adverbial and adjectival meanings, on the other hand, havetheir typical functions expressed by means of bound morphemes or particles, in the firstcase, and, in the second case, by bound morphemes, classificatory nouns and descriptiveverbs. Special bound morphemes are less than typical affix forms that can be classifiedas floating, quasi-floating, or non-floating in terms of whether they occur with differentword categories or not. Aside from the floating characteristics of bound morphemes theyshow the common property of occurring as the “outer”-most layers of bound morphemesin their word bases. Moreover, some of them interact in special ways with syntacticphenomena as, for example, the complementary distribution that is found betweensubject/object pronominal markers and coreferential pre-verbal subject/objectexpressions, or subject/possessor markers and free coreferential possessor expressions.","[644, 645]"
"Preceding the possessor form could, in principle, cause ambiguity of interpretation,insofar as the modifier would be interpretable as modifying either the possessor or the
                                               453
possessed element. One way of avoiding such a potential ambiguity would be toconstrain the interpretation of the scope of the modifier so that, as it seems to be the case,only the possessed noun can be modified inside a NP containing a possessionconstruction.","[484, 485]"
"        Tables 4-6 also illustrated the fact that (as previously shown in Facundes 1994aand 1995a) class membership for simple inalienable non-classificatory nouns cannot bepredicted solely on semantic grounds, and, thus, is grammatically determined. However,it still is the case that the class of concepts expressed by the nouns marked with -txiinclude those which are among the ones mostly likely to behave as inalienably possessedin other languages: body parts, personal belongings and abstract nouns. Worth noting is                                                 159
the fact that kinship terms are entirely excluded from the subset of inalienable nouns thatcan take the unpossessed marker -txi. The word kiyomanhi-txi ‘elder’ given in Table 6 isno exception since it simply refers to a person of advanced age, regardless of his/her kinrelationships. True kin terms are never used in unpossessed contexts; that is, they arealways possessed when used in normal speech. So, in order to express a proposition suchas ‘The grandmother has arrived’, one would normally utter the sentence in (14a) or(14b), where, since it is assumed it is somebody’s ‘grandmother’, the word for‘grandmother’ will be expressed as possessed either by a third person masculinepronominal form or by a third person feminine pronominal form:
 14a. Ø-akuro          apo-pe                      ‘His grandmother has arrived.’
     3M-grandmother.of arrive-PFTV   b. õ-akuro           apo-pe                     ‘Her grandmother has arrived.’
      3F-grandmother.of arrive-PFTV
       Cases where kin terms are used without a possessor formally expressed are thosewhere the kin term being used is a vocative, in which case the vocative is interpreted interms of its relationship to the speaker —that is, in such cases, the possessor is assumedto be the speaker. (15) illustrates the use of vocatives as kin terms NOT formally markedas possessed:
 15a. kuro   apo-pe                                ‘Grandma has arrived.’
     grandma arrive-PFTV   b. totu    apo-pe                               ‘Grandpa has arrived.’
      grandpa arrive-PFTV   c. nano apo-pe                                  ‘Mom/My auntie has arrived.’
      mom arrive-PFTV                                                160
   d. patu apo-pe                                    ‘Dad/my uncle has arrived.’
      dad arrive-PFTV
       A sample of the kin terms is listed in Table 7:

8.3.2 Oblique Grammatical Relations       Oblique grammatical relations have three basic formal properties: First, ingeneral, they are either marked by oblique markers, by a verb morpheme, or by both;second, they cannot be accompanied by coreferential markers in the verb; and, third, theyare structurally optional in the clauses where they can occur. The third property isinterpreted here as indicating that oblique grammatical relations are not part of the lexicalmeaning of the verb. There are several types of oblique grammatical relations, havingdifferent syntactic functions in the clauses. The special bound formatives markingoblique forms were morphologically described in chapter 7, in subsection 7.1.2. Theconstituent structure of these oblique constructions was described as NPobls in earlier in8.1.1.1. In the following subsections the oblique grammatical relations expressingdifferent semantic roles are presented under the same heading for the cases where theytake the same oblique marker.",[524]

found in the same sentence. In 005 the independent pronoun owa ‘3SG.F’ refers to the youngwoman, and is used to mark the fact that, contrary to what one would normally expect of her, shewent just by herself to watch the tapir eat the “uxi” fruit in the jungle:

9. Independent pronouns are used in appositive constructions in highlighting the presence/role ofa participant in discourse. In 006 uwa ‘3SG.M’ is used with the coreferential appositive nominalform kema ‘tapir’ in a context where the narrator describes the daring action performed by thetapir, namely to kidnap the young woman:

The use of independent pronouns accompanied by appositive constructions is pervasive in thetext in Appendix B (see 006, 021, 025, 033, 034, 036, 039, 041, 046, 050, 078, 084,086, 087,091).","[382, 383, 384]"

complements marked with -inhi in the previous subsection. In both of the examples in(52a) and (52b) the complex sentence has a complement clause with an intransitive verb,and a matrix clause with a complement-taking verb that is marked with the objectpronominal marker -ru. The presence of -ru indicates that its complement is functioningas object of the matrix verb, in which case V-inhi would have a nominal (not verbal)distribution. That is, in order for the V-inhi to function as the object argument of thematrix verb it must be nominalized. This nominal distribution as evidence for thenominal status of V-inhi is, however, a weak one, since (as seen under 9.1.2.1) even a fullsentence can also function as the object of a matrix verb, for example, for utterance verbs.","[638, 639]"
"The first cases illustrated in (60) and (61) below illustrate a different use of some of theformatives, namely -txi and -re2, described in the previous sections as part of the(un)possession marking patterns. In (60-61) these formatives are used as nominalizers ofverb forms:
60a. nota nhipoko-ta                                        ‘I ate.’
     1SG food-VBLZ  b. nota apoka-ru nhipoko-ta-txi                           ‘I found a place-for-eating.’

61a. pite kama-ru                                           ‘You made it.’
     2SG make-3M.O  b. pita kama-re1                                          ‘your work’
     2SG make-POSSED
       There are some special types of morphologically complex bound forms suchas -karu and -karo that attach to verbs to derive, respectively, masculine and femininenoun-like forms referring to the notional subject of the nominalized verb, and suchas -kutu and -kuto that attach to verbs to derive, respectively, masculine and femininenoun-like forms referring to the notional object of the nominalized verb. These formsconsist of a set of complex formatives marking relative clauses. For now I will only listthe examples in (62), and say that some nominal properties can be associated with the
                                                 214
words marked with these complex formatives. Their full description will be delayed untilthe last chapter where the syntax of complex clauses is described. (See also 4.4.)
62a. nota apoka-ru      atama-ta-karu
     1SG find-3M.O look-VBLZ-S.M.REL
     ‘I found the (masculine) one who watches.’  b. nota apoka-ru      atama-ta-karo

     ‘I found the (feminine) one who was eaten’
These, as well as other nominalizing formatives, will be properly described under 4.4along with the rest of the noun stem morphology. For now it suffices to say that there aregood reasons to argue that the forms given above either form nouns from other categoriesor add some nominal properties to verbs. The evidence will be presented as the nounmorphology is described in the next sections. Finally, aside from the property that nounsderived from other word categories have of being formed of bases belonging to anotherpart of speech, they also have another important property that distinguishes them fromsimple nouns: Nouns derived from other word categories do not subcategorize for(in)alienability.","[245, 246]"
"
       Whether the distinct behavior of these marginal cases says anything about thesynchronic status of their internal structure or not remains to be verified. One possibilityis that these nouns are lexicalized nominal forms that have lost the internal morphemicboundaries. Another one is that they are compounds that simply subcategorize to takesuch morphological markers.",[243]
"5.2.1.1.1      Meaning and/or Function of Formatives within Class1       Meaning and function are different things in the sense that, for example, acausative marker can mean ‘to cause’, so that a form such as V-causative will mean‘cause to V’, and, at the same time, this same causative marker can also have the functionof transitivizing an intransitive verb. Also, meaning and functions are not necessaryconcurrent properties of a morpheme (see criteria for defining a morpheme in chapter 3,under 3.3.1), since, for example, a morpheme can have a clear function (e.g., verbalizer,nominalizer etc.) but no semantically definable meaning —except for very abstract oneswhich, in such cases, are precisely what I call “functions” rather than “meaning”.",[340]
"         The first analysis just outlined is the descriptively least troublesome analysis tothe linguist because it makes use of suppletion to explain the various forms whichpossessed marking takes, therefore exempting the analyst from providing unique meaningor function to each of the suppletive forms. Such would be the case for the followingreason: In arguing that whether the {possessed} morpheme takes the form -te, -ne, -re1or -re2 would be purely a matter of which morphological (arbitrary) class the base takingthis {possessed} morpheme belongs to we would also be giving up any possibility offinding a semantic, phonological or syntactic motivation for the various possessedmarkers in the language. Moreover, the fact that -te, -ne, -re1 and -re2 can all becharacterized as denoting one general meaning, namely ‘possessed’, is supportive of anallomorphic analysis under partial suppletion. Notice, however, that the result of asuppletive analysis of possessed markers in Apurinã would differ from, for example, asuppletive analysis of go > went, be > am, is, are etc. in English. In go > went thesuppletion is grammatically motivated, since speakers/hearers only need to associate the“irregular” forms with the past tense. In be > am, is, are etc., suppletion is alsogrammatically motivated because speakers/hearers need to associate “irregular” formswith the tense, person and number. In Apurinã, however, suppletive forms such as -te> -ne > -re1 > -re2 would each need to be associated with an arbitrarily defined subset ofroots.",[261]
"
4.4.8 Other Processes of Noun Stem Formation       In addition to the noun stem formations given above there are others, lessproductive or of more limited use in the language. The first one is realized through somesort of “reduplication” of onomatopoeic forms, where the derived nouns refer to theanimal or phenomenon that produces certain sounds, and where the phonology of thesenouns results from an iconic representation of such sounds. As the examples in (98)illustrate, the appearance of reduplication is a result of the way speakers/hearers representwhat they hear; it does not constitute true reduplication in that the forms that result fromseparating the formally similar parts of these onomatopoeias do not stand as formativesthat can be found as part of other words:
                                                250
 98a. mẽko-mẽko-ru1                                   ‘thunder’
      mẽko-mẽko-3SG   b. toro-toro                                         ‘type of big frog’
      toro-toro   c. nhao-nhao                                         ‘type of large seagull’
      nhao-nhao
       Another process included here for forming noun stems where some partialregularity can be found involves certain proper names assigned to women. A few propernames for women coincide in ending in /ero/, as the examples in (99) are illustrative of:
 99a. irarĩero                                         ‘(woman´s name)’
      wild.pig.F   b. komarĩero                                        ‘(woman´s name)’   c. yakonero                                          ‘(woman´s name)’   d. mayoripero                                        ‘(woman´s name)’   e. mirĩero                                           ‘(woman´s name)’   f. nanãxiero                                         ‘(woman´s name)’   g. nainero                                           ‘(woman´s name)’   h. irĩero                                            ‘(woman´s name)’
Notice that, aside from /ro/ in /ero/ coinciding with the feminine gender marker -ro(described under 4.4.1), there is no other grounds for positing /e/ and /ro/ as distinctformatives. It is of interest in these examples, however, that the form irari in irarĩ-erocoincides with the word for ‘wild pig’ (and the nasalization of the last vowel could followfrom the allomorphy rule given in (18) of chapter 3). Such examples have been presentedhere for the sake of completeness, as they are restricted to just a few cases and could as
                                                 251
well be handled by semi-regular rules of analogy (such as, e.g., some version of lexicalredundancy rules) stored in the lexicon of the language. It is, nevertheless, worthy ofnote that some noun stems may take the form of conventionalized onomatopoeic forms.","[281, 282, 283]"
"            Functions usually associated with adverbs in other languages are accomplished inApurinã either by adverbial particles (as will be shown in 6.3.1) or bound markers in theverb. As we see in the next chapter, there are good reasons to treat these independentwords with adverbial functions as a subclass of particles rather than as an independentclass of adverbs. Not only is the case that the class of independent words used withadverbial functions is rather small but, also, there is no morphological way to derive aword with an adverbial function from another word.",[375]
"       The language has characteristics of a head-marking type language in having, forinstance, cross-referencing markings on verbs and possession markers on the headpossessed noun. The rich morphology of this language does not at all imply the lack ofsyntactic operations; instead, it simply means that many grammatical functions areformally encoded in the morphosyntax, i.e. they are expressed by forms that partiallyobey morphological rules as to their distribution, but syntactic conventions as to their useand allocation in the clause. As to clausal constituent order, the language is
                                                52
predominantly OV in terms of its word order corelations, although the most frequentorder in text is VO. The language also has a gender system based on thefeminine-masculine grammatical distinction, a morphologically marked noun classsystem based on alienable versus inalienable possession, and an incipient nounclassification system consisting of nouns with classificatory functions that recur as part ofa productive noun compounding system.","[83, 84]"
"       Base1 is then the result of the combination of baseØ plus class1 formatives. Thepresentation of these formatives will be given in the following sequence: Thegrammatical function and/or meaning which each formative of class1 has will bedescribed first; then the evidence for position classes is presented next, followed by theoverall distribution of these formatives in the verb. In many cases the meaning and/or
                                                 308
function of the formatives will be described superficially in this chapter and, in suchcases, I will return to them in chapters 8-10 in the required syntactic contexts. However,as mentioned earlier, even if the meaning and/or function of a formative turns out to bebetter understood in conjunction with phrasal or clausal considerations, the assumptionheld in this work is that their place inside the grammatical word needs to obeymorphological parsing principles as well and, as such, requires a morphologicaldescription.","[339, 340]"
"8.1.1.2          Oblique Noun Phrases            Oblique noun phrases (hereafter NPobl) consist of nominal forms that aremarked with one of the oblique markers which were morphologically described inchapter 7, in 7.1.2, and whose syntactic function of the (pro)nominal expressions where
3
    This sentence, however, could be grammatical if interpreted as ‘Her mother, she has left.’
                                                                 458
they occur will be discussed in 8.3.2. Oblique markers are the bound forms that attach toa (pro)noun to form a NPobl, as the examples in (31) illustrate:
 31a. n-awa-ru            wai [[nota tanu-ro       nurumane]NP -kata]NPobl
      1SG-exist-3M.O here          1SG spouse.of-F relative-ASSOC
      ‘I live here with the relatives of my wife.’   b. p-ita-ru            su-pe      [[ata nurumane awapoko]NP -mokaru]NPobl
      2SG-brother.of-M go-PFTV 1PL relative              village-GOAL
      ‘Your brother has gone to the village of our people.’
As can be gathered from the two examples in (31), although the morphological “host” ofthe oblique marker is always the last word of a NPobl, its semantic scope is the wholeNPobl within which it occurs, not the word base it is phonologically attached to. Theungrammatical examples in (32) are given to demonstrate the fact that oblique markerscannot attach to elements within a NPobl other than the rightmost one:
 32a. *n-awa-ru           wai nota tanu-ro1-kata   nurumane
      1SG-exist-3M.O here 1SG spouse.of-F-ASSOC relative
      (I live here with the relatives of my wife.)   b. *n-awa-ru           wai     nota-kata     tanu-ro1 nurumane
      1SG-exist-3M.O here 1SG-ASSOC spouse.of-F relative.of
      (I live here with the relatives of my wife.)
       The examples in (33) show that a NPobl passes both the movement andreplacement tests for constituency. If we compare (33a) to (31a) we can see that theNPobl can move as a unit; and if we compare (33b) to (31b) we can see that a NPobl can bereplaced by a single word, where both clauses (with and without replacement) haverelated meanings in that they can refer to the same location/goal:
                                                459
 33a. [[nota tanu-ro          nurumane]NP -kata]NPobl n-awa-ru       wai
        1SG spouse.of-F relative-ASSOC                1SG-exist-3M.O here
       ‘I live here with the relatives of my wife.’   b. p-ita-ru         su-pe      [werã]
      2SG-brother-M go-PFTV there
      ‘Your brother has gone there.’       A valid question about what is being treated here as NPobls regards the extent towhich they are different from NPs and, moreover, whether such differences would justifycreating a new phrasal category rather than simply positing a new NP subcategory. Interms of the structural definition given in the previous subsection for NPs, one couldargue that the following examples in (34) present a piece of evidence for not treating theputative NPobls as NPs, where in (34b) a pronoun cannot replace the NPobl given in (34a):
 34a. nota apo-pe         [mipa-kata]
      1SG arrive-PFTV Mipa-ASSOC
      ‘I came with Mipa.’   b. *nota apo-pe    [uwa]
      1SG arrive-PFTV 3SG.M
For all NPs seen so far it is the case that they can be replaced with an independentcoreferential pronoun. Thus, what is relevant in (34) is precisely the fact that, as shownby (34b), NPobls cannot be replaced by a coreferential independent pronoun. However,the ungrammaticality of (34b) follows directy from the semantics that the oblique marker-kata adds to the NPobl mipa-kata, rather than necessarily from any structural distinctionbetween caseless and oblique noun phrases. That is, the distinction between NPs andNPobls can be described solely in terms of their distribution in the clause that followsfrom the grammatical relations they bear. So, as an associative oblique grammatical                                                460
relation (described in detail in 8.3.2.3), mipa-kata can only be replaced by a semanticallycompatible “pro-form”, as illustrated in (35):
 35a. nota apo-pe        [uwa-kata]
      1SG arrive-PFTV 3SG.M-ASSOC
      ‘I came with him.’
       Another possible argument for distinguishing NPobls from NPs in Apurinã followsfrom its internal structure. As was seen in the previous section and summarized in (27), aNP can precede a possessed noun. In (36) it is shown that NPobls cannot occur with apossessed noun:
 36. *nu-suka-ru           uwa     [nota hãke-ru-monhi] suto-re
       1SG-give-3O.M 3SG.M 1SG child-M-GOAL woman-POSSED
      (I gave it to the wife of my son.)
In (36), again the distinction can be argued to follow from the semantics of possessionconstruction rather then from any structural syntactic property of NPobls.","[489, 490, 491, 492]"
"
       Kin terms can be described as a subset of inalienable non-classificatory nouns thatsimply can never occur unpossessed. If nouns for kin terms never occur unpossessed, thesituations in which they would be required to take the unpossessed marker -txi neverarise. Furthermore, the motivating factor underlying the non-occurrence of kin terms inunpossessed contexts can be construed as consisting of the socio-cultural correlates ofinalienability in Apurinã. In other words, inalienability, in this case, is defined forApurinã as the grammatical expression of special types of relationships involvingpossessor and possessee which have become conventionalized enough so as to disallow acompletely semantic account of it but which, nevertheless, still partially reflect socio-cultural aspects of the Apurinã society. In this sense, if inalienability is described as
                                                 161
some sort of grammatical encoding of (conventionalized and especially closesocio-cultural) relationships between the possessor and the possessee, the expression ofbiological relationships is then the one which encodes the highest degree of closenessbetween the possessor and the possessee in Apurinã, followed by body partsrelationships, personal belongings relationships plus abstract relationships, and, perhaps asmall residue of other relationships. (For views of inalienability along these lines seeHeine 1997, Chappel and McGregor 1996b, Facundes 1994a and 1995a, Chappel andMcGregor 1989, Carlson and Payne 1989, and Nichols 1988). I will leave unexploredhere the full details of such a general analysis of inalienability marking in Apurinã,referring to Facundes (1995a and 199a) for earlier and more detailed analyses of theformal and conceptual underpinnings of inalienability marking in this language.","[192, 193]"
"        The second and third causativizers have the same phonological form, -ka, and thesame function, occurring with both transitive and intransitive verbs. They only differ intheir affix position within the verb: One belongs to class1 bound verbal forms(5.2.1.1.1.3) whereas the other belongs to class2 bound forms (5.2.1.2.1.4). In theexample in (80a) n- is the causer and amarunu ‘boy’ is the causee; in (80b) (repeatedfrom chapter 5), nhi- is the causer, -ru the causee, and yapa the object. In the first case amonovalent verb is made bivalent, and in the second case a bivalent verb is madetrivalent:
      O.CAUSEE s.causer-V
 80a. amarunu       n-umaka-ka2-nanu-ta
      boy          1SG-sleep-CAUS-PROG-VBLZ
      ‘I am making the kid sleep.’      causer-V-o.causee      O.CAUSEE
    b. nhi-nhika-ka3-ru       yapa
      1SG-eat-CAUS-3M.O capybara
      ‘I made him eat capybara.’
        That the causee of an intransitive verb behaves as a grammatical object is shownby the next example in (81). In this example the causee is anãpa ‘dog’ and it co-occurswith a coreferential object pronominal marker, i.e. -ru ‘3M.O’, in the verb:
     S.CAUSER V-CAUS-o.causee     O.CAUSEE
 81. kuku       muteka-ka3-pe-ru   anãpa
     boy        run-CAUS-PFTV-3M.O dog
     ‘The man made the dog run.’                                                 507
       Notice also that, as can be seen by comparing (80a) and (80b), the causer mapsonto subject regardless of whether the verb is transitive or intransitive. On the otherhand, as can be seen by comparing (80b) and (81), the causee is mapped onto the objectregardless of whether the verb is transitive or intransitive.","[538, 539]"
"       To a great extent, the syntax of Apurinã consists of the functional or distributionalbehavior expressed by bound formatives. The notions of a grammatical subject and agrammatical object can be established partly on the basis of two paradigms of boundpronominal forms, one used for subject and the other for object grammatical relations,and the way these grammatical relations pattern in causative, reciprocal, reflexive andrelative constructions. Oblique grammatical relations are generally marked with oblique                                                615
markers that attach to (pro)nominal forms. A VP constituent cannot be easily motivatedon the basis of language internal evidence and empirical grounds. Inter-clausal relationscan be marked with a few subordinator forms, but such relations are more often (in termsof token as well as type sentences) expressed by juxtaposition —as is the case of sentenceconjoining.","[646, 647]"
