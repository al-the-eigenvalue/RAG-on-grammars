   4.3.1 Adpositions   Adpositions are particles which occur as the heads of adpositional phrases
and are used to mark oblique case roles on non-core noun phrases. Taba is
rather unusual in having both prepositions and a postposition. The
postposition marks nouns as locative while the prepositions mark a variety of
other roles. Adpositions are discussed in more detail in chapter 13, where
reasons for the existence of both prepositions and a postposition are also
explored.

        4.3.1.1 Prepositions                                                                             case,
      Taba has four prepositions: ada which marks comitative or instrumental
                                                              iaries, and lo, a
pake which marks instrumental case, untuk which marks benefic
                                                                             the
similative marker. All of these are probably recent innovations in Taba, and
meanings of all of them can also be expressed by other means.","[149, 150]"
"    In many languages, possessive pronouns are used to refer to possessors. This
is not the case in Taba, which, strictly speaking has no possessive pronouns.
Rather, possessor nouns and the nouns referring to whatever they possess are
linked by ligatures which are marked for the number and person of the
possessor noun.5 The possessive ligatures used in the Waikyon dialect are
illustrated in figure 7.3.",[235]

          ‘We didn't catch it enough’   Sentence (80) was a response to the question ‘Why did the Taba Jaya (name of
a boat) stop coming to Makian?’. In this case, the Taba Jaya, a fairly large boat
significant enough to be given a name, is accorded something more like animate6      There is some degree of variation in the form of this pronoun. The forms nig and dik are also
       encountered occasionally. In the Waikyon dialect, nik is clearly most common, but dik is
       quite common amongst speakers of some other dialects. Although there are no differences
       between any of the forms used in Waikyon to distinguish alienable, inalienable or edible
       possessive classes, such distinctions are found in closely related languages such as Sawai
       (Jacqui Whisler, n.d.) and Buli (Maan, 1951), and it may be that some of these formal
       distinctions signal such possessive classes in other dialects.",[236]
"   In a few cases the form of a word can be used to incontrovertibly define its
word class, but this is rare. For example taktek ‘scoop (n.)’ is derived from the
verb tek ‘to scoop’. The instrumental reduplicative prefix tak- (see §7.1.2.1)
marks taktek as a noun.",[134]
"   Another underlying assumption of the standard approach to grammar
writing outlined above is an assumption that the levels of analysis within a
language are essentially modular: the phonology is clearly distinct from the
morphology which remains clearly distinct from the syntax, etc. Again, it can
be argued that languages themselves do not really consist of discrete modules
which can be divided up so neatly. Inevitably, in writing a grammar of sucha
format the linguist is required to make decisions about exactly where certain
‘fuzzy’ phenomena of the language should be placed. For example, where
should the line be drawn between morphology and syntax with respect to say
clitics, which on phonological grounds might be taken as morphological
components of the word to which they are phonologically bound, but which on
syntactic grounds occur as independent entities themselves? Recent
grammaticalisation studies (see, for example, Hopper & Traugott , 1993;
Traugott & Heine, eds. 1991) have made it clear that shifts in the grammatical
status of individual morphemes, lexemes and constructions are the norm in
languages rather than the exception.    When, then, does say a serial verb become
an adposition? And how should intermediate cases be treated within a
grammar?    Another problem with the traditional approach to grammar writing
is that languages often include minor form-classes which can have a role to play
at different structural levels within a language. This is the case, for example,
 20                                      Taba
 with the class of ‘directionals’ which have been identified in Taba. Some of the
 forms which have been derived from directional roots are formally classified as
 nouns while others can function as verbs or as adverbials of various kinds.
 Should they all be treated separately, in order to satisfy the constraints of the
 structural divisions of the grammar, or should they be treated together, in order
 to show both their formal and functional commonalities?","[39, 40]"
"
   5.3.1 Formal characteristics   Nominal clauses consist of just a noun phrase in the case of existence clauses
(see §5.3.2.6), but more commonly (in all other kinds of nominal clauses) of both
an argument noun phrase (which may nevertheless be ellipsed) and a noun
phrase acting as predicator. Given that both the argument and the predicator in
these nominal clauses are noun phrases, the first problem which needs to be
addressed in this discussion is how we can determine which noun phrase bears
which function.",[165]
"   The kinds of arguments that Dixon is referring to here as ‘subjects’ are
arguments that in some sense have greater ‘syntactic weight’ than other
arguments. While such a category might not be immediately obvious if we look
solely at overt phenomena such as word-order or case-marking, a unitary
‘subject’ category may be revealed at a deeper level of analysis, in that only
subjects may be able to control syntactic phenomena such as relativisation, or
equi-NP deletion, etc.
                               Overview of clausal syntax                         179   The problem for determining what, if anything, is the subject in Taba then,
should be clear. Is there at some level of syntax a conflation of the A and S roles
such that a unitary category of ‘subject’ has common properties, or is Taba, (as a
split-S language), like Acehnese where only the grammatical relations of Actor
and Undergoer are relevant?","[198, 199]"
"   Although few Makianese today speak other minority languages from North
Maluku, this clearly has not been the case throughout history. For many years
Ternatan functioned as a regional lingua franca, and many Ternatan loan words
can be found in contemporary Taba. Loans from a wide variety of source
languages are found in Taba, including a few words from European languages
such as Dutch which appear to have been borrowed directly into Taba. For
example, I have been unable to find any other languages in the region with
forms similar to Taba bonci for peanut’ (< Dutch boontje ‘little bean’). The other
regional languages I am aware of have borrowed Malay kacang. A number of
similar forms are also found.",[47]
"   Grammatical relations have long played a central role in grammatical theory.
Indeed, the distinction between ‘subject’ and ‘predicate’ goes back at least as far
as Plato (Lyons, 1968:10). In Plato’s view, according to Lyons (1968:11):
‘Roughly speaking, the subject of a predication names the thing about which
something is said, and the predicate is that part of the sentence which say
something about the thing named by the subject’. A moment's reflection will
show that such a definition does not work: the problem lies in determining just
what a clause is about. ‘Aboutness’ is simply too difficult to characterise
unambiguously.
178                                         Taba
      Grammatical relations, then, must be definable in terms other than those
relating to topicality that traditional definitions such as that just quoted from
Lyons have been framed in. This chapter began with a quote from Dixon
(1994:6-7) explaining three primitive relations (S, A, and O) that have so far been
used to elucidate principles of word-order, etc. in this chapter. We noted that
the definitions provided by Dixon for S, A and O were problematic. He defines
S as the intransitive subject, and A as the transitive subject without at first
giving a definition of subject. Likewise he defines O as the transitive object
without first stating what a transitive object is. We circumvented that problem
for Taba by redefining S as simply the sole obligatory argument of an
intransitive verb, A as the argument cross-referenced on a transitive verb, and O
as the argument not cross-referenced on a transitive verb. Dixon went on to say
that
           In languages with a nominative - accusative grammar, S and A
           naturally group together. Languages of the ergative - absolutive type
           link S and O. Many languages have some accusative and some ergative
           characteristics, linking S with A for certain purposes and S with O for
           other purposes. For any discussion of universal grammar, it is most
           useful to take S, A and O as the basic grammatical relations, and to
           define ‘subject’ (and ‘pivot’...) in terms of them.
                                                   (Dixon, 1994:6-7)   If the above quote is taken at face value, the suggestion would be that in a
language like Taba, with ‘split-S’ marking for intransitive verbs, the relevant
grammatical relations might just as well be Actor and Undergoer, where Sa
arguments group with A as Actors, and So arguments group together with O as
Undergoers. (Such a claim is made by Durie, 1987, 1988a, for another split-S
Austronesian language, Acehnese.)        Yet, elsewhere in Dixon's book, he states
that a universal category ‘subject’ can be defined: ‘A and S functions are
grouped together as “subject’”’ (p.124). Dixon does provide a cautionary note
about Acehnese for which he states that ‘it may be for Acehnese that the only
viable definition of “subject” is [Durie’s] Actor’ (p.125).","[197, 198]"

   Adnominal possession is signalled by interposing an inflected possessive
particle between the possessor and the thing possessed. The inflected
possessive particle is cross-referenced with the Number and Person of the
possessor and it is formally categorised as a ‘ligature’: it intervenes between a
modifier noun and its head and serves to indicate that there is a ‘possessive’
relationship between the modifier and its head.

           ‘My foot’   In many contexts, overt reference to the possessor is not made. This applies
to all kinds of possessors, but perhaps most commonly to the non-third person
singular ones which are cross-referenced on the possessive particle.(6)        particle possessed           ni             mtu

            ‘My foot’   Given that ellipsis of the possessor is a very common feature of Taba
discourse, the cross-referenced possessive particles often function like
possessive pronouns in other languages.                Given that overt reference to a
possessor noun is always possible, however, it is felt best that the forms not be
labelled ‘possessive pronouns’ as such, but rather as pronominally cross-
referenced ligatures. The complete set of forms is listed in figure 9.1. (Rules for

contexts where full noun phrases can be used, except that pronouns cannot
normally be used to refer to inanimates (but see §7.3.1.1 and §6.5 on reflexives
for some exceptions). Pronouns referring to Undergoer arguments (§4.2) may
optionally cliticise (§3.2) onto the verbs of which they are arguments.",[235]
"   R.M.W. Dixon has published a number of works dealing with the nature of
the obligatory arguments that co-occur with intransitive and transitive
predicates in the languages of the world. In Dixon (1994:6-7), he says that:          all languages work in terms of three primitive relations:            S — intransitive subject
            A — transitive subject
            O - transitive object
       In languages with a nominative - accusative grammar, S and A
       naturally group together. Languages of the ergative - absolutive type
       link S and O. Many languages have some accusative and some ergative
       characteristics, linking S with A for certain purposes and S with O for
       other purposes. For any discussion of universal grammar, it is most
       useful to take S,    A and O as the basic grammatical relations, and to
        define ‘subject’... in terms of them.",[175]
"       So-called ‘double agreement’ has been reported in other Austronesian
languages such as Kokota in the Solomon islands (Palmer, 1995). Palmer
suggests that the verbs involved in double agreement in Kokota (expressing

referenced because the referents of these arguments are subject to forces over
which they have no direct control. Although Kokota is typologically quite
different to Taba, (it is otherwise an accusative language rather than a split-S
language), much the same case can be made for the sole arguments of the Taba
excretory verbs discussed here. Excretion is typically something that people are
forced to do rather than something which they have any real degree of control
over.","[246, 247]"

"       There are a number of derivational affixes which can only be used to mark

to introduce an extra argument, is illustrated in (26). In this case, the root verb
goras ‘to shave / peel’ is transitive and takes an agent Mina and a patient kapaya
‘pawpaw’ as its arguments. The derived form is ditransitive and the applied
argument is an instrument. The applicative suffixes and other derivational
processes involving verbs are discussed in chapter 8.",[140]

   5.3.2 Semantics of nominal clauses   A number of different semantic relationships between arguments and their
nominal predicators may be distinguished. These are identity, possession,
location, quantity and manner. These have correlations with the formal
subcategories of predicators outlined above, but there is no exact isomorphism
between the semantic and the morphosyntactic categories.

        5.3.2.1 Identity   In an identity clause, the predicator encodes some new information
concerning the identity of its argument. The argument is almost invariably
given information. In these clauses, the predicator is usually a noun phrase
with a general noun as its head (§7.1), or a demonstrative pronoun (§11.1.2.1).
The first type is illustrated in example (44) where the predicator consists of just
a head noun guru ‘teacher’. In (45), the argument is expressed as a pronoun i
‘s/he’ and occurs after the predicate, mapin ‘woman’. In (46) the predicator is a
possessive noun phrase (§9.1) with kobit ‘knife’ as its head.","[167, 168]"

        8.3.1.7 Some semantic entailments of causative morphology   In many languages, the use of causative morphology entails that the subject
of the derived clause is a volitional actor who intended to bring about a certain
result. This is not strictly the case in Taba, where it can be explicitly signalled
that the result of the process was not intended, even though causative
morphology is used. (This feature of Taba semantics is in keeping with the
general functions of Actor intransitive verbs in Taba.)      In example (39) we see what a speaker would normally say in expressing that
someone had husked a coconut.","[253, 254]"

      6.3.1 Preposed NP intonation units      Quite a large number of utterances are encountered in Taba discourse where
 noun phrases occur alone as intonation units, most commonly preceding a
 clause with which they appear to be associated. The elements found here
 attract contrastive emphasis by virtue of their prominent position relative to the
 clause itself. The major function of this construction in Taba is to name
 something which provides an orientational framework for what follows it.
 Whatever follows this element is then interpreted with respect to the orientation
 it provides.6 Often, the fronted NP is coreferential with one of the arguments of
 the following clause, but this need not always be the case.",[190]
"   8.3 Valence increasing morphology
   There are three derivational affixes which can be used for increasing valence:
the causative prefix ha- and two applicative suffixes -Vk and -o. They are all
quite productive, although in some cases particular combinations have become
lexicalised, as with the causativised forms of hani ‘have’ discussed above.     While
all of these affixes will be discussed in this section which has been labelled
‘valence increasing morphology’ it should be borne in mind that the affixes
discussed here do not always function to increase the valence of the verbs to
which they are attached. In some cases, their function is to highlight certain
arguments more prominently or to change the meanings of the verbs to which
they are attached in other ways. This applies especially to the ha- ‘causative’
prefix discussed in §8.3.1. All of these affixes, though, do occur with the
function of increasing valency, and they will all be discussed under the rubric of
‘valence increasing morphology’. In this chapter, we will be concerned
primarily with the morphosyntactic and semantic functions of each of the
affixes. This discussion will begin with an examination of ‘causative’ ha-, and
be followed with a discussion of the applicative suffixes: first the internal suffix
-Vk then the external suffix -o .

      8.3.1 The causative prefix ha-      The underlying form of the causative prefix is ha-. However, in most
environments the initial h of the morpheme is deleted. (See §2.7.1 for details).
Taba has no productive periphrastic causative constructions, but see §12.2.3 on
causative serial verb constructions.","[247, 248]"
"          8.3.3.1 Deriving bivalent intransitives from Undergoer intransitives        This construction is not very common. All of the attested cases of -o deriving
 a bivalent intransitive are applied to verbs of position or posture where the
 position or posture of the preverbal noun phrase is described relative to some
 other noun phrase (the applied Undergoer). An illustrative example is given in
 (87).",[266]
"   The first part of this chapter discusses the noun itself, and derivational
processes which can be used to create nouns. The second part of the chapter
discusses the structure of the noun phrase. In the final section of the chapter the
nominal grammatical categories of number and person will be discussed, as will
pronouns.",[215]
"
      8.4.2 Non-volitionality      When prefixed to an Actor intransitive stem, the derived form is an
Undergoer intransitive verb. I have so far only heard one spontaneous
utterance where ta- is used with this function, but I have also elicited a few
further examples. All of those which have been collected are intransitive verbs
of motion which have an animate Actor in their underived forms. The
argument of the Actor intransitive form is not deleted in this case, but rather it
appears as Undergoer of the derived Undergoer intransitive verb. The major
difference in meaning is that whereas the underived Actor is generally seen asa
volitional actor with a purpose in mind, the derived Undergoer is not seen as
having any particular purpose. The spontaneously uttered example of ta- with
this function is shown in (116).",[274]

         ‘Coconut rice’       One further point should be made with regard to bivalent intransitive
 derivation. Although with many of the uses of applicative morphology to be
 discussed below it is possible to substitute adpositional expressions for
 applicative suffixes as markers of extra arguments, this is not possible in the
 case of bivalent intransitive derivation with -Vk. The putative counterpart of
 (50) seen in (52), for example, is grammatical, but has a quite different meaning
 from (52). This difference in meaning stems from the heterosemy? of ada, which,
 in addition to its role as an instrument marking preposition also occurs as a

       of lexemes (much like polysemy) except that the lexemes may have different word class
       memberships which have presumably come about through some kind of grammaticalisation
       process.

"
     While there is reasonably good evidence for not preferring the metathesis
analysis as far as the -Vk applicatives are concerned, there is one other possible
case of metathesis discussed in the next section for which the evidence is
somewhat more equivocal.

     2.7.5 Classifier-numeral compound metathesis    The other potential instance of metathesis in Taba concerns a few classifier-
 numeral compounds. Taba has a large number of numeral classifiers, some of
 the most common of which occur as proclitics, prefixed to the first element of a
 number phrase (see chapter 10).","[104, 105]"

subcategories of nouns are distinguished: pronouns (§4.1.1), locatives (§4.1.2),

none of these subcategories.","[134, 135]"

          ‘It?s name is ‘cold lava’  (lave that  is cold).’ [i.e. lahar]    Demonstrative pronouns can be used as predicators, as illustrated in (38).
 Note that although the predicator in this case is referential, it is not given
 information. However, the argument, Banda ni wog ‘Banda’s canoe’, is given
 information.        Here, the speaker assumes that the addressee knows Banda has a
 canoe, but that the addressee is not able to identify which canoe that is. The

"        2.7.4.1 Stems with stressed final syllables   The most common form of the -Vk applicative is -ak, but other forms are also
possible. A preliminary illustration of -ak suffixation is given in (91).(91)    a. Iswan      nitftiy     do
           Iswan     n=stiy       do

the -Ak applicative suffixed to monosyllabic words is -ik.? The -ik form of
9    In many cases the conditioning for the -ik suffix appears to be phonological.    Quite a few of
     the verb roots to which -ik is suffixed contain the stressed vowel i or e. However, there are a
     number of exceptions to this (e.g. hasdp ‘to shower’ ~ hasdpik ‘to wet something in the
     shower’; tdk ‘to nod head’ ~ tdkik ‘to butt head into something’) as well as roots containing
     stressed i to which -ak is attached (e.g. amlih ‘to laugh’ ~ amlthak ‘to laugh at (someone)’).
                                        Phonetics & phonology                                     81applicative derivation with a monosyllabic root (in this case wét ‘hit’) is
illustrated in (92).(92)   a. Nim          babasi       lwét      = au

          ‘His father hit him with a rattan cane.’   There is one attested example of -Vk applicative derivation with a disyllabic
root having exceptional stress on the final syllable (see §2.4). In this case, the
form of the applicative suffix is -ak.(93)   a. Namlih
          n=amlih
          3sg=laugh
          ‘She’s laughing.’       b. Namlihak          tit

          ‘She’s laughing at us.’
       2.7.4.2 Stems with unstressed open final syllables   When the root to which the applicative suffix is attached is already vowel-
final, no vowel is used in the suffix, as in (94). (None of the vowel final roots
which have undergone applicative derivation in the corpus are stressed, and all
are polysyllabic.)
   The reasons for the existence of the -ik applicative form are probably at least partly historical.
   Some historical roots have probably lost final unstressed i, and other forms possibly have
   historical remnants of the most common Undergoer referencing pronoun, 3sg. 1, attached to
   them.

      2.10.1.5 palatal glide /j/   In accordance with the standard Indonesian writing system, the palatal glide
/j/ is represented with the symbol y e.g.(136) /pojo/                    poyo              ‘head’
   2.10.2 Presentation of examples   In the presentation of sentential examples from Taba, interlinear glosses are
provided. In the first line of an example a surface phonemic representation will
be given. A second line will generally be included, showing a morphemic
representation including an indication of the division into morphemes with
representation of the underlying phonemic character of each morpheme. It has
been felt worthwhile to include a morphemic representation distinct from the
phonemic one given first to make it easier to see the underlying structure of
forms such as those including ‘metathesised’ applicatives (see §2.7.4). The third
line consists of a gloss of each morpheme and the final line is a free translation.
This approach is illustrated in (137).","[117, 118, 119]"

  Abstract     This thesis is a descriptive grammar of Taba (also known as Makia
                                                                         n Dalam

 head noun, but with the genitive preceding the head noun.","[1, 2]"
"  The proclitic ha= is one such classifier. In (32) ha is the phonological
dependent of wal ‘eight’ but the head of the whole phrase hawal pa sio.(32)   hawal              pasio

   Compounding occurs when two words, neither of which is a clitic, fuse
together phonologically to create a new form which now behaves as a single
110                                                 Taba
phonological word. Compounds are words in which the combined form is
recognisable as an independent semantic unit itself. Such compound forms
often have lexicalised meanings. Compounding results in the creation of a new
word, both phonological, and morphological, from what were once two
independent words.(33)     ntonololan
         n-tono-lolan
         3sg-look.at-path/road
         ‘lizard’   Cliticisation results in the loss of some degree of phonological substance for
one or other of the cliticised forms. In cliticisation, it is generally the first
element which loses in phonological substance, as illustrated in (34) below
where the final syllable of mawowo ‘light’ has been lost, and stress reassignment
has taken place after it has been cliticised to appo ‘to downwards’ (the resulting
form mawoappo has the lexicalised meaning ‘the next day’).(34)     uncliticised

         /|    /|        |\    7
         ma wo          ap po       In another kind of cliticisation, pronouns referring to Undergoers sometimes
encliticise to the verbs which precede them. This process results in the
formation of a single new phonological word from what was once two
phonological words, but the resulting single phonological word in this case is
composed of two morphological words. In this kind of cliticisation, the
pronouns lose stress, and behave phonologically as if affixes to the verbs. They
thus lose their status as independent phonological words, but still behave as if
independent morphological units. This is an optional process, presumably
conditioned by discourse factors that are not well understood (but see §9.3.1).
In (35) we see the Undergoer pronoun i ‘3sg’ occurring as a stress attracting

phonologically attached to the verb of which it is an argument.","[129, 130, 131]"

  8.3.2 The internal -Vk applicative  -Vk suffixation performs a variety of functions, each of which will be
discussed in the following sections:       © it derives ‘bivalent intransitive’ verbs from Undergoer intransitives
       e it derives transitive verbs from Actor intransitives
       * it derives ditransitive verbs from transitive verbs
       e it can act as an ‘intensive’ marker   The use of -Vk with verbs of excretion is discussed separately in §8.3.2.5. The
exact details on what kinds of semantic roles are associated with the arguments
licensed by this applicative suffix are sometimes obscure, depending on the
semantics of the verb to which they are suffixed (and also, ocassionally,
contextual pragmatic features). Most commonly, the -Vk suffix allows an extra
instrument to be included as a core argument in the clause. Examples of -Vk
suffixation that allow extra themes, patients, companions and recipients are also
encountered. In some cases the meanings of the derived forms involved have
become lexicalised.","[254, 255]"

" 4    Although non-verbal predicates take no more than one argument, it is clearly the ‘figure’
      which occurs before the predicate. Moreover, in the case of locative (NP or PP) predicates,
      the predicate itself clearly constitutes the ‘ground’ and normally follows the ‘figure’.

intransitive verb, a bivalent intransitive or a nominal predicate has a
pronominal argument, whatever its role in the hierarchy in figure 6.1, slot [1] is
unavailable to it and it must occupy slot [2] immediately after the verb.","[182, 183]"

         ‘Ahmad or Iswan’      Note that when number (see §7.3) is marked on the noun phrase, the phrasal
enclitic =si is added as the last element of the entire phrase rather than on any
conjoined elements, as can be seen in (65) above. Note that there are some
important meaning differences between Io ‘and’ and ada ‘with / and’. Although
either conjunction may be used for the same purpose in many instances, there
are some cases where the use of ada leads to an ambiguous reading while lo
would not lead to this problem. Example (68) is ambiguous between whether
or not there are two or three people being referred to in total.(68)     matlu         ada yak
         mat=lu        ada yak
         CLASS=two     with 1sg
         ‘two people with me’   (either two or three people in total)       If the conjunction lo ‘and’ had been used in the above example, there would
have been no ambiguity: there would have been a total of three people referred
to.","[230, 231, 232]"
"   As mentioned above, dependent locatives occasionally occur without any
independent head. The conditions for this are not fully understood at present,
but in every case where this usage has been noted, it can be assumed that an
independent directional is anaphorically, or cataphorically retrievable by the
addressee.",[138]
"   The most common monomorphemic clusters found in Taba are NC
sequences. Blust (1978) and others have reported that one of the distinguishing
features of the South Halmahera languages is what has been called ‘post-nasal
syncope’, or the deletion of vowels following the initial nasal consonants of
some words. Thus, in the Waikyon dialect of Taba we have forms such as mto
‘eye’ < PSH *mta < PAN *mata. (mta rather than mto still exists in some other
Taba dialects.) The majority of forms with initial NC sequences in
contemporary Taba are Undergoer intransitive verbs (§4.2) with initial m-.
These have arisen from roots to which the stative deriving prefix *ma- was once
attached and to which post-nasal syncope has subsequently applied. In modern
Taba, although the sequence ma- or m- commonly occurs at the beginning of
Undergoer intransitives, the prefix is no longer truely productive (but see
§8.5.2). A few examples of such forms are given in (39).(42)   mbtiluk   ‘berotten’    <   *ma-+   PAN        *buRuk
       mit       ‘be soft’     <   *ma-+   PEMP     *lut
       munihis   ‘be thin’     < *ma-+     PAN      *nipis    Such morphological and phonological processes explain the vast majority of
initial consonant clusters, but do not yet provide an account for the origins of
initial geminates. Although the specific processes which have applied in each
and every case for the emergence of initial geminates are not clear, there is one
process which may have played a prominent role.",[81]
"       Actors, primary Undergoers, and secondary Undergoers     The facts as presented so far would suggest that the grammatical relation
  ‘subject’, as usually used to refer to a unified category represented by A and S
  arguments, does not have any relevance to Taba, at least as far as the overt
  coding properties of arguments are concerned. The problem is that there is no
  real coherence within any S category in Taba. Sa and So have quite distinct
  properties. Sa aligns with A in its overt coding properties while So aligns most
  clearly with the arguments of non-verbal predicates, and with the first-
  appearing arguments of bivalent intransitives. In fact, So shares more
  properties in common with transitive O and with the first Undergoer argument
  of ditransitives: none of these are cross-referenced on verbs, and all pronominal

arguments of these sorts occur immediately postverbally. It is only in the case
where they are represented by full NPs that there is any difference in their
behaviour. All of this, then, suggests that Actor and Undergoer are the
grammatical relations most pertinent to describing Taba morphosyntax, at least
at the level of overt coding.","[204, 205]"

9     The Taba system of using Number to mark respect is similar to that found in many
      European languages (cf. Brown & Gillman, 1960). Where Taba differs from common
      European systems is in using respectful plural forms in both forms of address and in forms
      of reference (i.e. in the third person as well as in the second person).

perspective of children whom they are addressing in their use of plural
marking. For instance, utterances such as the one exemplified in (85) are
commonly heard spoken by people older than those they are referring to,
presumably in order to show that respect should be accorded to the referent by
the addressee.","[238, 239]"
