4.2 Participles with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)garThe suffix -(ŋ)gar forms a participle, consisting of a verb stem plus the non-finite
suffix (ŋ)gar (realized as -gar after nd, t and sometimes r). Nouns formed with the
-(ŋ)gar suffix are attributes: they denote a habitual, stative or agentive quality.
Note this suffix is also used in counterfactuals (Section 9.4.3).
108        4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possession(4-12) a. munje wasowŋgar aram
          munje    wasow    -ŋgar              aram
          man      die.irr  -nfn.sg            snake
          ‘poisonous snake’       b. morasi apro nirŋgar munje
          morasi     apro     nir      -ŋgar       munje
          habit      bad      do.irr   -nfn.sg     man
          ‘bad man’ (lit. ‘man who does bad things’)In both the examples above, the participle formed with -(ŋ)gar carries the
meaning of habituality: the snake is (always) venomous; the man is someone who
is known for habitually doing bad things. These constructions also express agen-
tive nominalizations – i.e. expressions like ‘killer of men’ or ‘doer of bad things’.
So a sentence like the following:(4-13) yu yimbar andurgar
       yu     yimbar    andur             -gar
       2sg    canoe     carve.irr         -nfn.sgmeans both ‘you carve canoes’ (often or habitually) and ‘you are a canoe carver’;
that is, the fact that you carve canoes is a characteristic by which other people
know you.
    The same is true of the following sentence:(4-14) ŋa sokoi aŋgar
       ŋa     sokoi         a                   -ŋgar
       1sg    tobacco       consume.irr         -nfn.sgThis can be translated both as the habitual ‘I smoke’ (in the sense of smoking
regularly or habitually) and as the stative ‘I am a smoker’ (as opposed to being a
non-smoker).
     The suffix-(ŋ)gar takes no TAM marking, even though it occurs in a position
after the verb stem that normally would be filled with an irr suffix (for intransi-
tive verbs) or an object suffix inflected for TAM (for transitive verbs). The follow-
ing sentence illustrates:(4-15) munje kowot inde ŋɨ             nɨpɨs Merew =re o -ŋgar
       man      old    dx.m 3sg.m able Sanae =all go.irr -nfn.sg
       ‘the old man is able to go to Sanae’
                                                      The ergative case (erg)     109
Even though the nfn suffix does not inflect for TAM, it does inflect to express
person and number, according to the following pattern:
           singular    dual     plural1          -ŋgar       -ŋgre    -ŋgar
2          -ŋgar       -ŋgrem   -ŋgrem
3sg.m/f    -ŋgar       -ŋgre    -ŋgro
Thus, one says:(4-16)    ŋgɨ    kakau           tow           -ŋgro
          3pl cocoa (TP)         plant.irr     -nfn.3pl
          ‘they plant cocoa’ (generally, habitually); ‘they are cocoa planters’(4-17)    ŋɨ        kakau           tow           -ŋgar
          3sg.m     cocoa (TP)      plant.irr     -nfn.sg|1pl
          ‘he plants cocoa’ (generally, habitually); ‘he is a cocoa planter’Because these constructions are nominalizations and not verbs, they do not
negate like verbs. They are non-verbal predications. All one does to negate them
is add the negator wákare (see Section 5.2).
     So compare:(4-18)    a.   ŋgɨ sokoi aŋgro
               ŋgɨ    sokoi       a                   -ŋgro
               3pl tobacco        consume.irr         -nfn.3pl
               ‘they smoke’; ‘they are smokers’          b.   ŋgɨ sokoi aŋgro wákare
               ŋgɨ    sokoi      a                -ŋgro        wákare
               3pl tobacco consume.irr -nfn.3pl                neg
               ‘they don’t smoke’; ‘they are not smokers’4.3 The ergative case (erg)Tayap optionally marks the subject (A) of a transitive verb with an ergative
case clitic, on noun phrases and free personal pronouns (note that subject and
object verbal pronominal suffixes follow a nominative-accusative system, see
Section 5.3).
110           4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possession      Note the difference in the first word of the following two sentences:(4-19) a. Sopak wokara
          Sopak       wok                      -ara
          Sopak-Ø     go.3sg.f.r               -perf
          ‘Sopak has gone’            b. Sopakyi taruŋg kratukun
               Sopak =yi        taruŋg  kra -tu -ku        -n
               Sopak =erg.f firewood chop.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
               ‘Sopak chopped firewood’In (4-19a), there is no object, and the subject (S) of the sentence, Sopak, is
unmarked.
     In (4-19b), Sopak performs an action on an object. That object, like the subject
of the previous sentence, is unmarked. But Sopak receives the ergative clitic =yi,
which identifies her as the subject of the transitive clause.
     The ergative clitics that attach to the subject NP of a transitive verb also
encode gender and number. The markers that occur on NPs are:      =ŋi      masculine ergative
      =yi      feminine ergative (becomes =i when it follows r, t, nd, w and
               often k)
      =gi      plural ergativeNote that as in all other areas of Tayap grammar, gender is not indicated in the
plural number, so a word like rorsem=gi (‘children=erg.pl’) can refer to either
male or female children.
    These ergative clitics are also attached to the personal pronouns in a pattern
that maintains the plural meaning of =gi but not the gendered meaning of =ŋi
and =yi on 1sg and 2sg. In other words, gender is not marked in 1st and 2nd
persons.","[127, 128, 129, 130]"
"Authorship of this bookThe first person pronoun used throughout this work refers to Don Kulick. I col-
lected all the linguistic and ethnographic data analyzed here over the course of
my thirty years’ work in Gapun. As mentioned above, I wrote the entire first draft
of this grammar and dictionary and submitted it for review at Pacific Linguistics in
2011. Shelving the project to complete other work, I took it up again in 2017, when
I approached linguist Angela Terrill, who had trained in descriptive linguistics at
ANU and written a grammar of the Papuan language, Lavukaleve, to collaborate
with me in rewriting the text (Terrill 2003). Angela worked on the morphological
and grammatical analysis in preparing the manuscript for publication.

Conventions and abbreviations
Tayap examples in the grammar usually consist of four lines. The first is the Tayap
speech written in bounded, unsegmented words.
     The second line is the same clause or sentence in which the words have been
separated into morphemes.
     The third line is the interlinear gloss of the morphemes. The space separating
the morphemes in the second and third lines is larger than it is in most grammars
for reasons of readability. The usual manner of presentation, in which glosses for
morphemes are chained together in long, complicated strings, assumes readers
with a great deal of specialized knowledge, experience and patience. Separat-
ing the morphemes should make the glosses easier to process. The spacing does
admittedly make it a bit harder to see individual words, but those appear in the
first line of the examples.
     The fourth line is the translation into English.
     An example is as follows:(1) Merewŋgrogi munje parŋgɨro
    Merew -ŋgro =gi             munje par     -ŋgɨ       -ro
    Sanae    -pl     =erg.pl man       bury.r -3sg.m.r.o -3pl.r.s
    ‘the Sanae villagers buried the man’Suffixes are marked by hyphens (-) and clitics are marked with an equal sign (=).
In Tayap there are no prefixes, only suffixes, and enclitics rather than proclitics.
      Some glossing conventions used throughout this grammar in the interlinear
glosses need to be noted. Tayap verbs – and other words – have a broad range of
meanings, and an o, for example, is consistently glossed as ‘strike’ in the interlin-
ear glosses, but is translated to its context-specific meaning as ‘hit’, ‘stab’, ‘kill’,
etc. in the translation. Similarly, the Locative case has a broad range of meanings.
It is glossed as loc when it has a locational meaning but in other contexts it may
be glossed as temp for temporal, com for comitative or all for allative.
      Further conventions need explanation are as follows:
      The first is the pipeline symbol | which appears in example 3 below under-
neath the final morpheme -n. This symbol means that the morpheme it glosses
has more than one meaning. Disambiguation occurs through the use of pronouns
or nouns, or through context.
      An S is used in glossing transitive verbs to show features of the subject. With
intransitive verbs, the person/number/status of subjects are marked in the lan-
guage but there is no S in the gloss.

                                            Conventions and abbreviations     XIX
    Another convention concerns Tayap’s discontinuous subject markers. Some
verbs have subject morphemes that occur both before and after the object mor-
pheme. An example is as follows:(2) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
    ŋgu    =yi      aram ta  -tɨ  -ŋgɨ                  -n
    3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -r.s -3sg.m.r.o            -r.s
    ‘she saw a snake’In this verb, the combination of -tɨ before the object morpheme and -n after the
object morpheme encodes either a 2sg or 3sg.f subject in realis status. The
pronoun ‘she’ disambiguates the subject to be 3sg.f, in this case. Since it is the
combination of the two discontinuous subject morphemes that produces meaning,
the labeling convention adopted here is to gloss the first subject morpheme
with ‘s’ (‘subject’), and to gloss the combined meaning of the two morphemes
under the second morpheme. The object morpheme in verbs like this case occurs
between the two subject markers, and is bounded by < > instead of hyphens, to
show that it intervenes between the two discontinuous subject markers.
    So in this grammar, the example above is written as:(3) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
    ŋgu    =yi      aram ta  -tɨ         -ŋgɨ        -n
    3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -s-         <3sg.m.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
    ‘she saw a snake’The abbreviations used in the interlinear glosses otherwise generally follow the
Leipzig glossing rules.
    Note that the dictionary uses some different terms and abbreviations (see
page 351 for those).

1 The Tayap language and its speakers1.1 General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in
    GapunTayap is the name of a Papuan language spoken by a dwindling number of people,
most of whom live in a small village called Gapun (the speakers themselves call
the language Tayap mer, which means, precisely, ‘Tayap language’). Gapun is
located on the Papua New Guinea mainland, between the Sepik and Ramu rivers,
about thirty kilometers inland from the northern coast. The village is far from
roads of any kind and is difficult to reach. It lies in a mosquito- and leech-infested
swamp in the middle of the rainforest (see Map 1.1).
     The Tayap language is tiny, even by the extreme standards of Papua New
Guinea, where one linguist estimated that thirty five percent of the languages
have fewer than five hundred speakers (Sankoff 1980: 96). As far as anyone in
Gapun has been able to remember, Tayap has never had more than, at most, just
over one hundred speakers. That small number seems to have remained stable for
a very long time. By the 1980s, however, children were no longer learning Tayap
as their first language. Instead, they were learning Tok Pisin, the most important
and widely-spoken national language of Papua New Guinea.
     I began my work in Gapun in 1985. At that time, the number of people who
actively commanded Tayap – in the sense that they spoke it with other villagers
and were able to narrate stories in it – was about ninety, out of a population of
about one hundred and thirty (most but not all of whom lived in Gapun). Twenty
three years later, in 2009, the population of Gapun had grown to two hundred
and eight people. In addition, seventeen people who had been born and raised
in Gapun had left the village (mostly because of conflicts over land rights and
sorcery accusations) and moved to the village of Wongan, which is a ninety-
minute trip from Gapun, by foot and then dugout canoe across a vast mangrove
lagoon.
     If we were to include those people in a count of Gapuners the total population
would be two hundred and twenty five. And if their children, most of whom were
born and raised in Wongan, were to be included, the number of people who could
reasonably claim to be a Gapuner would be close to three hundred.
     Any way Gapuners are counted, it is clear that their numbers have doubled
over the past twenty years. However, during that same time, old people have died
and children have continued to learn Tok Pisin as their first language. By 2009,
fewer than twenty people still living in Gapun had grown up with Tayap as their
first language.https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-001

2 Semantic error: the verb nam- ‘tell’ is incorrect here; the speaker wants kotar-(p)-e- ‘ask’.
   Grammatical errors: the speaker omits the ergative clitic on the subject of the verb, and also
omits a locative case marker on Yengia, the undergoer of the verb. The grammatically correct way
of phrasing the question is:      ŋayar=ke yu=yi            morasi apro Yengia=nɨ    ni-tu-ku-n?
      true=q        2sg=erg.f deed      bad Yengia=loc do.r-s<3sg.f.r.o>2sg|3sg.f.r.s
      ‘Is it true that you did something bad to Yengia?’

4.4 Peripheral casesTayap has five peripheral cases. Three of the cases mark animate and inanimate
referents differently.
     The possessive case marks possession, association and part-whole rela-
tionships, with no distinction between alienable and inalienable possession.
Possession is discussed in Section 4.5.
     The locative case has the widest semantic scope of Tayap’s peripheral cases. It
specifies location in time and space, covering relationships that in other languages
are expressed in allative, instrumental, comitative, temporal and durative cases.
     The ablative case expresses movement away from a person, place or object,
or an action of revelation in which something that was hidden becomes visible.
     The perlative case expresses movement along, through or by means of.
     The dative case is used to mark recipient, purpose, comparison and a number
of other relations.
     All these peripheral case markers are clitics, as they occur attached to the last
element of an NP with scope over the whole NP: see for example (4-40i), (4-40j),
(4-42b), (4-43d), (4-43i), among others. Many of them contain optional material
(shown in parentheses), the conditioning factors of which are not known.
Examples (the relevant peripheral case clitics are in bold):

        detail in Tayap that is not adhered to by most speakers younger than thirty.

130        4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possession4.5 PossessionPossession is marked by a possessive clitic on the possessor. Possessor clitics
mark higher animate singular (=ma), higher animate plural (=mandama) and
inanimate (=ŋa) possessors. Note also that Tayap has external possession con-
structions, discussed in Section 7.5 in the section on benefactives.
     This clitic is also used to form relative clauses (Section 9.5), finite nominaliza-
tions (Section 9.6) and perception clauses (Section 9.7).
     Example (4-44) shows the possessive clitic marking an NP consisting of a
modified noun ‘cold belly’, thus demonstrating the clitic rather than affix status
of these forms:animate plural inalienable:(4-44)   imin pokemŋan munjema tɨk
         imin pokem =ŋan        munje          =ma       tɨk
         belly cold      =poss man             =poss     story
         ‘the calm man’s story’For the purposes of possession, animals and humans are considered higher ani-
mates, and plants are considered inanimate. Possessive relations expressed with
this construction include alienable, inalienable, body part, association and part-
whole possession. There is no morpho-syntactic distinction between these cate-
gories (but see Section 7.5 for the role of benefactive object suffixes in body part
possession).
     Some examples:animate singular body part (human):(4-45)   Mbanaŋma tokɨmot
         Mbanaŋ =ma              tokɨmot
         Mbanaŋ =poss            chest

         nuwomb =ŋa            taw
         stream      =poss side
         ‘the side of the stream’Recursive possession also occurs, using the possessive clitic on each possessor,
with the possessee unmarked (see also example 4-44):(4-51)   Samekma rorma mbor suman
         Samek =ma         ror     =ma mbor      suman
         Samek =poss child =poss pig             big
         ‘Samek’s child’s big pig’The animate possessive clitic can be used on an inanimate noun to highlight that
the noun has some kind of relation to humans:

         ‘big thief’
4.5.2 Possessive modificationThe possessive clitic can also occur, similarly to the above examples, but on
nouns or verbs as well as adjectives, to create modifiers: for example, in (4-57)–
(4-58) it occurs on a noun, rendering it a modifier, and in (4-59)–(4-61) it occurs on
an adjective which here modifies a verb:(4-57)   kandawŋa munje
         kandaw     =ŋa         munje
         sickness =poss         man
         ‘sick man’(4-58)   sumbwaŋa noŋor
         sumbwa =ŋa          noŋor
         ground     =poss    woman
         ‘ground woman’ (an insult: it means ‘you’re so old you have been
         around since when the ground emerged’)(4-59)   ei sumanŋa ror
         ei    suman =ŋa           ror
         cry big           =poss child
         ‘cry baby’ (i.e. a child who cries a lot)(4-60) warak sumanŋa noŋor
       warak suman =ŋa                 noŋor
       talk     big    =poss           woman
       ‘cross woman’(4-61)   munje apro ŋgadanŋan rukŋan
         munje apro ŋgadan =ŋan                ruk     =ŋan
         man      bad sore          =poss      smell   =poss
         ‘bad, sore-ridden, smelly man’In (4-59) the verb ei ‘cry’ is modified by ‘big’, the phrase in its turn modifying the
noun ‘child’. Example (4-60) has the same structure: the verb is followed by the
possessive-marked adjective, together modifying ‘woman’. Example (4-61) is more
complex. Here we have a head noun munje ‘man’, modified by adjective ‘bad’ and
134        4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionpossessive-marked verbs ‘sore’ and ‘smelly’. Note that these are the only construc-
tions in which verbs can appear without person/status suffixes (see also Section 5.1).","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154]"
"4.1.1 Noun phrase structureNoun phrase structure is as follows:     [PossP Part HEAD Mod* Quant]=casePossP is a possessive phrase and Part is a participle; the head follows these. In the
Mod(ifier) slot, either an adjective or a numeral, or both, in that order, can occur,
or a relative clause, or alternatively a possessive phrase. Non-numeral quantifiers
follow, and the final element of an NP is a case-marking clitic. The head noun
itself can be reduplicated.
     Noun phrases themselves are readily elided, but if an NP is present, its head
is obligatory, or very rarely elided if retrievable from context. The head appears
together with any applicable case marking. The head can be a noun, modified or
not, or a pronoun. Some examples follow:
Subject NP expressed by free pronoun:(4-1) ŋgɨ nam tankuro
      ŋgɨ nam ta           -n -ku    -ro
      3pl talk hear.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -3pl.r.s

      ‘their two names’The PossP element can be a possessive pronoun, e.g. yimen nirŋgar ‘our girlfriend’
or a full possessive NP:(4-7) munjenum =mandama kokɨr

The head can be reduplicated, in the following cases to indicate plurality. The
first example has a rather complex structure, with ‘spouse’-‘spouse’ modified by
‘two’, all of which is taken up in the possessive pronoun ‘their’:(4-8) ŋan omɨnde omɨnde sene ŋgan nomb sene ŋgankun

       ‘Pepe, she was leading.’(4-11) mbumjor ŋɨ tɨ ndereke mbet

       ‘the mbumjor snake he too came along the path’       Note: A mbumjor snake is an extremely venomous black snake with shiny black skin
       and blue stripes, well known to villagers because of the numerous deaths for which they
       are responsible.","[125, 126, 127]"
"1.6 Tayap linguistic profileLike many Sepik languages, Tayap is a synthetic language. Verbs are the most
elaborated area of the grammar. They are complex, fusional and massively sup-
pletive, with opaque verbal morphology including unpredictable conjugation
classes, both in terms of membership and formal marking. There are very many
suppletive stem forms marking a basic realis-irrealis distinction as well as various
other TAM categories. Person/number marking also differs depending on the verb
type. This is a language of “baroque accretions” (McWhorter 2001); or what Dahl
(2004) calls “mature phenomena”.
     There is a fundamental distinction in verbal morphology between realis and
irrealis stems and suffixes, but this distinction is overridden by transitivity in the
prohibitive and counterfactual forms.
     Grammatical relations are marked by verbal suffixes, which distinguish
S/A versus O. In some conjugations S/A is marked by discontinuous mor-
phemes. Free pronouns and noun phrases mark the ergative case (A) compared
to unmarked forms for the absolutive (S/O). As in many Papuan languages
which have an ergative case, the ergative marker is optional and is frequently
omitted.
     There are two genders, masculine and feminine, marked not on the noun
itself but on deictics, the ergative marker, suppletive verbal stems and verbal
affixes. The unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including animate nouns,
even humans, is feminine: however, a male referent may be masculine. Another
criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be masculine;
short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine. Again this type of gender-
assignment system is typical of the Sepik region.
     Gender is only ever marked in the singular, never in the dual or plural. Nouns
generally do not mark number themselves, although there is a small class of
largely human nouns which mark plural, and a smaller class which mark dual.
These categories, where marked, are largely marked by partial or full supple-
tion. Oblique cases, largely local, are marked by clitics attached to the end of the
oblique NP. Two adjectives also mark number, with partially suppletive forms for
singular, dual and plural. A further two adjectives have partially suppletive forms
for singular and plural.
26        1 The Tayap language and its speakers     Phonologically, the language has a medium-sized consonant inventory with
voiceless stops, voiced (prenasalized) stops, nasals, semivowels and a rhotic/
lateral flap. There are six vowels, /a/, /i/, /ɛ/, /u/, /ɔ/ and /ɵ/. Stress is largely pre-
dictable, typically word final but occasionally occurring elsewhere in the word.
     The expression of possession is relatively simple: a possessor is marked with
a clitic, and there are no subcategories of possession.
     There are two kinds of complex predicate, which can be distinguished
morpho-syntactically: serial verb constructions; and complex predicates formed
with the verb ‘to be’, which consist of progressives and habituals. There are three
types of complex clause: coordinate, cosubordinate (medial-final clause chains)
and subordinate clauses. Subordinate clauses consist of relative clauses, adver-
bial clauses, and perception constructions, as well as finite nominalizations.
2 Phonology and orthography2.1 PhonologyTayap forms in this and all chapters are presented in the orthography as outlined
below (Section 2.8) except in the consonant and vowel phoneme tables and when
cited inside square brackets.","[45, 46, 47]"
"3.10.1 Sounds used for calling animals and babiesVillagers also have distinctive ways of calling a number of animals and to amuse
or distract pre-verbal babies:      to call a pig                   close mouth, repeatedly make a sound like
                                      clearing the throat
      to call a puppy                 /‖/ – alveolar lateral click made with rounded lips
      to call a grown dog             short brisk whistle held over one beat, repeated
                                      many times
      to call a cat                   wsi-wsi-wsi-wsi
      to call a chicken               tu-tu-tu-tu-tu (high pitched)
      to get a baby’s attention       repeated kissing sounds
      to distract a crying baby       blow air through closed lips3.11 Intensifiers and discourse markersA number of words and suffixes in Tayap have no referential meaning. They func-
tion to draw attention to or emphasize the word they follow. So an angry shout
of ayáta! ‘enough!’ followed by the word kai expresses stronger disapproval than
ayáta without the kai.
     A second group of words function as ways for speakers to do things like plan
discourse, stress particular constituents, hedge and change topics.
     Tayap’s intensifiers and discourse markers are as follows
                                           Intensifiers and discourse markers   101
3.11.1 Intensifierskai intensifier used only with the command ayáta ‘stop it’. Kai may be
    a short form of kaitkait, which means ‘rotten shit’, and is used in
    censorious abuse.(3-91) ayáta kai manɨŋg imin anem ayáta

       (manɨŋg imin is a euphemism for yɨwɨr imin, which means ‘shit belly’, i.e.
       a belly filled up with feces because one has eaten so much. The speaker
       here is chastising his relatives, saying that they eat well but never feed
       him, and that such behavior must stop)arɨk   intensifier used only with mokop/mosop ‘little’(3-92) mosop arɨk ŋayi ainɨ ŋguratmborinŋgɨn andnɨ kararneta mbot inde

           ‘Catfish cunt, fucking black cunt hole!’This intensifier also appears to have had a plural form: in 1991, I recorded a single
instance of the following, in the speech of a woman then in her mid-forties:        c. Sakema sumannɨ aŋgurem aprɨ sakrem!
           Sake=ma       suman=nɨ a          -ŋgurem aprɨ         sakrem

3.11.2 Discourse markersŋgo      carries the sense of ‘well then’ or ‘in that case’ (cf. Tok Pisin:
         “pastaim”), e.g.:(3-97) Speaker A:

         o       -tet       ŋgo!
         go.sbj -2sg.m.r dm
         ‘Go, then/in that case’ndɨ      discourse marker that draws attention to the noun phrase that precedes
         it. It conveys the gentle nuance that whatever precedes it is known
         or should be known by the addressee. Its meaning therefore extends
         from what one might translate as ‘you know’, ‘right’ or ‘so’, to more
         exasperated nuances like ‘in case you weren’t paying attention’ or ‘you
         perhaps don’t know, but now I’m telling you’. An example expressing
         impatience is as follows:(3-98) tukur non      ndɨ we                -tak
       rain some dm come.sbj                -2sg.f.r
       ‘Come on rain, come!’Another typical example that acknowledges previously conveyed information,
and that also might be interpreted as displaying some impatience, is the following:
(3-99)   Speaker A: ŋa kebis katɨpkrunetana
                    ŋa kebis
                    1sg lettuce (TP)                        katɨp         -kru          -net           -ana
                        cut_up.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s -intent
                        ‘I’m going to go cut up lettuce’
104       3 Word classes        Speaker B: yu ndɨ katɨptukun

                   2sg dm cut_up.sbj -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
                   ‘So cut it then’        When ndɨ occurs in a sentence that has at least one verb inflected in
        the counterfactual mood, it also functions syntactically as a marker of
        subordination (see Section 9.4.2).nda    discourse marker that is likely a reduced form of the deictic morpheme
       ainda (see Section 3.8). Used like ndɨ to draw attention to the noun or noun
       phrase that precedes it, and often carries a sense similar to English ‘then’:(3-100) mboka ŋa nda numbwan aproyi tatin
        mbok           -a   ŋa nda numbwan apro =yi
        go.1sg.f|1pl.r -and 1sg dm thought bad =erg.f        ta     -t -i         -n
        get.r -s <1sg.r.o> -2sg.|.f3sg.f|1pl.r.s
        ‘we went along and then a bad thought occurred to me’ (lit. ‘a bad
        thought got me’)In a way that is similar to and probably related to the pragmatic function of
Tayap’s deictic words (see Section 3.8), discourse markers frequently occur multi-
ple times in a single sentence, as in the following:(3-101) a. ŋa ndɨ nda namnak Ŋgemanŋi mera
           ŋa ndɨ nda nam -nak                  Ŋgeman =ŋi mera

           ‘Well you all, I really don’t know anything about that pig’3.12 Mood particlesTayap has four freestanding words that express expectation (awa), supposition
(mera), mirative (kapa) and surprise counter to expectation (nímera). These are
discussed in Section 7.6.
4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers,
  case marking and possession4.1 IntroductionNoun phrases function as arguments of verbs: A, S, O and peripheral roles. Noun
phrase function is expressed with clitics marking A. O and S arguments are
unmarked, and oblique arguments are marked by clitics.
     This chapter first discusses noun phrase structure, with a discussion of mod-
ifiers of the head noun. This is followed by a discussion of each case marker:
ergative, locative, ablative, perlative and dative. After this comes a description of
possession in Tayap. Young people’s Tayap is discussed in relation to ergativity
(Section 4.3.2) and peripheral case markers (Section 4.6).","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"
"4.3.1 Functions of the ergative caseIn Tayap, ergative marking is “optional” (Foley 1986: 107; Dixon 1994: 58; McGregor
2010). This is typical in general of those Papuan languages which have an ergative
case (Foley 2000: 374; McGregor 2010: 1616). In many of these languages, ergativity
tends to be associated with a cluster of features, in particular agentivity, control and
animacy – most particularly agentivity, such that a more agentive transitive subject
is more likely to receive ergative case marking than a less agentive transitive subject.
     However in Tayap, as in many other languages, ergativity seems to be sensi-
tive to rather more factors than just agentivity.
     The oldest speakers agree that most utterances that omit the ergative are per-
fectly fine Tayap. Speakers do not reflect on the grammatical role of the ergative
markers; the way they explain them is in terms of utterance length. They say, “if you
want to say it the long way, you say ‘ŋayi’ [i.e. ŋa=yi ‘1sg=erg.f’]. If you want to say
it shorter, you say ‘ŋa’” (“Yu laik skulim, em ‘ŋayi’. Yu laik sotim, bai yu tok ‘ŋa’”).
     The functions of the ergative case in Tayap are rather opaque. The following
contrastive examples are intended to show that ergativity marking does not
equate simply to animacy, agentivity or control.
     High animacy of transitive subject argument:(4-22) a.      ŋayi namwankuk nda
               ŋa=yi          nam    -wan         -kuk                 nda

and both present in the clause. In those instances, ergative marking is used to
clearly distinguish the subject of a transitive verb from its object.
    For example, the following sentence is ambiguous:(4-29) ŋɨ ŋgat poŋgɨn
       ŋɨ       ŋgat        po        -ŋgɨ        -n

       ‘he speared the cassowary’ or ‘the cassowary stabbed him’ (with its claws)Speakers would normally interpret the fact that the pronoun ‘he’ occurs in the
sentence-initial position as indicating that ‘he’, and not ‘the cassowary’, is the
agent in this sentence. But without ergative marking the phrase is ambiguous,
and older fluent speakers say that it is poor Tayap.
    The reasons for the ambiguity are:
(a) the class 1 transitive verb o means ‘strike’ or ‘shoot’, and here it could mean
     either ‘penetrate or pierce with a spear’ or ‘penetrate or pierce with a sharp
     claw’; and
(b) cassowaries are typically gendered masculine, so the 3sg.m object suffix on
     the verb can refer to either a male person or a cassowary.","[132, 133, 134, 135]"
"9.4.3.1 How to form a counterfactual verb
Counterfactual morphology is quite specific. Intransitive verbs use their irrealis
stems, and transitive verbs their realis stems.
     The actual stem form of many intransitive verbs is the same as their irrealis
form. But other verb stems have suppletive forms. They change in regular ways,
but most of the forms occur nowhere else in Tayap (an exception is the counter-
factual form for o ‘go’, which is the same as that verb’s habitual stem, see Section
8.3.2). The changes to the verb stems are as follows:    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain e → wek
    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain o → wak
    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain i → ik
    class 3 verb stems, a → akexceptions:     (1) the verb ‘be’, a-, becomes awk in cf
                (2) the verb ‘marry’, ar-, remains the same and does not change
                    to ak in cfThe following is a full list of how counterfactual intransitive verbs are formed.

                       is the same as the
ŋɨ ‘he’                stem in irrealis)                           -ret (cf) or -net (irr)
ŋgu ‘she’                                                          -rak (cf) or -tak (irr)

Note that the counterfactual -rɨk is always stressed, in which point it differs from
the formally identical progressive marker also -rɨk (see Section 8.3.1.1).
     The counterfactual affix -rɨk is optional in those cases where the form of
the verb stem in the counterfactual differs from its form in the irrealis. So, for
example, a verb like ‘be’ is realized as a in its irrealis form, but in the counter-
factual, it becomes awk. This partially suppletive stem change makes the coun-
terfactual morpheme -rɨk redundant. Therefore, it can be omitted. But it doesn’t
have to be omitted.
     The phrase ‘she would have been’ can thus be expressed in any of the follow-
ing four ways:      awk-rɨk-rak
      awk-rɨk-tak
      awk-rak
      awk-takTransitive verbs display a similar range of variation. They can be formed in ways
that either include or exclude the following morphemes in parentheses. Note the
realis forms of the subject and object affixes:

                                6.1.6)So a verb like ‘I would have eaten it’ has the following forms, all of which senior
speakers insist mean the same:2verb stem.cf + (-rɨk) + (-nv/-tv)           + object.r + subject.r
     ak-       -rɨk       -nu-                 <ku>        -n             →     akrɨknukun2
     ak-       -rɨk                             -ku        -n             →      akrɨkkun
     ak-                  -nu-                 <ku>        -n             →      aknukun
     ak-                                        -ku        -n             →        akkunAs with intransitive verbs, all these options for variation only apply to verbs that
alter their stems in the counterfactual. They don’t apply to a verb like moser
‘buy’, for example, because that verb has the same stem form in both the irrealis
and the counterfactual (since moser isn’t a class 1, 2 or 3 verb; see the discussion
above about which verbs change their stem form in the counterfactual).3 In this
case, where the stem does not change to express the counterfactual, the coun-
terfactual morpheme -rɨk is needed – even if the -nv/-tv subject morphemes are
optional.
     So the full range of inflectional options listed above applies to verbs like o
‘hit’ or wawar-(p/w)-e ‘hang up’, because to express counterfactuality, those verb
stems change and become wak and wawarwek respectively. In those instances,
once again, the counterfactual affix -rɨk is redundant, since the stem change
already signals counterfactuality.
     Negative counterfactual actions are expressed by simply negating the rele-
vant subordinate verb as in a main clause, and following this with one of the
hypothetical particles (most commonly ndɨ), then expressing the main clause in
the counterfactual as usual:
2 In the morphological combination -rɨknukun, the morpheme-medial n and u undergo metath-
esis, resulting in [ɾɵkunkun]
3 To lessen the risk for confusion, the verb stem of such verbs is glossed as cf in counterfactual
constructions, even though the stem is identical with its irr form. An example is (9-23).

reference of an NP by specifying the role of the referent of that NP in the situation
described by the [relative clause]” (Andrews 2007: 206). Relative clauses in Tayap
are nominalized, marked with the inanimate possessive clitic =ŋa(n) which
appears on the verb of the relative clause. This possessive clitic =ŋa(n) is added
to a fully inflected verb, which then functions as a subordinate relative clause.
The common argument or head (“domain nominal” in Andrews’ 2007 terms) of
a relative and a main clause can be in S, A, O or oblique function in the relative
clause and in the main clause.
     Tayap relative clauses are external. The relative clause generally directly
follows the common argument in the main clause. This is the position held by a
nominal modifier (e.g. adjective) as well (see Chapter 4).
     The common argument may also be expressed with a deictic (Section 3.8)
functioning resumptively with respect to the head noun, and typically following
the common argument directly: for example, consider (9-29a-b). In both examples
there are two resumptive pronouns, in (9-29a) following the relative clause and as
the final part of the main clause and in (9-29b) following the common argument
and as the final part of the main clause. Note that these resumptive pronouns agree
in gender and number with the common argument. They are not an obligatory part
of relative clauses: see for example (9-29c) and (9-29f), which do not have them.
     Note that the verb of the relative clause is fully inflected, and the relative
clause contains all the usual components of a clause. The relative clause may
                                                          Relative clauses     269
even contain a complex predicate: see for example (9-29f) which has a relative
clause with a serial verb construction involving kv ‘bring’ in construction with a
verb (see Section 8.2.3.1).
     Relative clauses would appear to always be restrictive. No non-restrictive rel-
ative clauses have been found in the data. In the following example the posses-
sive marker is in bold and the head noun in the main clause underlined.(9-29) a. nɨm puŋgokawukŋan aŋgi kopi aŋgi

            Ie, ‘the one they struck later, I don’t know where they got it from’Relative clauses are not very common and the corpus contains few examples to
show whether the common argument is syntactically a part of the relative clause
or part of the main clause. However the main clause of (9-29d) can be negated
using wákare before munje (and changing the verb kiraw to kirawŋgrɨ). This sug-
gests that munje belongs syntactically in the relative clause rather than the main
clause. However more examples are needed to be certain.
    Tayap used to have another relativizing suffix: the morpheme -gin (or perhaps
it was a clitic =gin, there is not enough evidence to show). This morpheme seems
to be synonymous with, and occurs in exactly the same morphological slot as,
=ŋa(n). For example:(9-30) patɨr aŋgu ŋaŋan omoŋi perkungin otɨtekara

sions that I recorded in the 1980s. By 2009, however, it was no longer used by
anybody. 49.6 Finite nominalizations with consequence clitic =ŋa(n)Finite nominalizations are constructed, like relative clauses, with the possessive
clitic, and carry the meaning of consequence; that a particular state has been
brought into existence because of an action. For example:(9-31)   kokɨr mbɨdtia ŋaŋan noŋor kokɨr kratianŋa
         kokɨr mbɨd      -t -ia4             ŋaŋan noŋor kokɨr

         ‘my head hurts because my wife hit me on the head’9.7 Perception constructionsSentences that describe an act of perceiving, like seeing or smelling, can be
expressed in two ways in Tayap: either paratactically as two separate clauses, or
with a nominalized construction.
     In the perception construction, the perceiver is subject of the main clause,
and the person or thing perceived is object. In the subordinate (nominalized)
clause, always placed after the main clause, the action expressing the circum-
stances of the perception is indicated. Coreferential with the main clause object
is the thing perceived, which may be subject or object in the subordinate clause.
     The two possibilities are exemplified below:

5 Note that number agreement is not consistent in examples (9-32a) and (9-32b): the speaker
uses the form ‘woman (SG) two’ rather than the dual form naŋaw or the plural naŋro, and the
object agreement is plural rather than dual. These two examples were from an elicitation session
and the inconsistency was noticed too late to be queried directly.
                                                  Perception constructions      273
One argument, the subject or the object of the main clause, is coreferent with
either the subject or object of the nominalized clause. The verb of the nominal-
ized clause is fully inflected. These clauses, while marked with the possessive
clitic (as relative clauses are), are structurally different from relative clauses.
     Relative clauses modify NPs, and they occur in the modifier slot within an NP.
These nominalized clauses, on the contrary, while they share an argument with
their main clause, do not modify an NP but rather modify an entire main clause,
within the specific semantic domain of perception. The shared argument of the
clauses is expressed only once, in the main clause, while the nominalized clause
consists only of the nominalized predicate and any arguments.
     These are not complement clauses either, as the nominalized clause does not
function as an argument of the main clause, but rather as a modifier. This can
clearly be seen for example in (9-32b), in which it can’t be the case that the nomi-
nalized clause is functioning as an argument of the main clause. The main clause
verb has 3pl object marking, so the object must be the women, not the clause
describing them going into the forest.
     Other potential candidates for complement clauses, including constructions
of saying and telling, are expressed with verbal morphology involving indirect
commands (see Section 7.1.4).

            ‘I saw her going inside the house’In (9-34a) the main clause is Sopakyi Nik tatŋgɨn ‘Sopak saw Nik’, and the subor-
dinate perception clause mbor pokunŋa ‘[Nik] spearing the pig’. Thus the clause
structure as a whole is ‘Sopak saw Nik [spearing the pig]’. The clause is not mod-
ifying Nik, as it would be in a relative clause, but rather the perception clause
predicates what is perceived.

          ‘I didn’t know you (m) had come’9.8 Cosubordinate constructionsA further type of clause combining construction in Tayap consists of medial verbs
appearing with modifying suffixes and then linked to independent final verbs,
which are always verbs of motion. These are cosubordinate constructions, also
called clause chaining constructions: the terms are used interchangeably here.
     In these clauses, a medial verb appears in its irrealis or realis stem form,
without a subject marker, with an object marker if transitive, and one of three
linking suffixes: -ra (modifier), -kar (manner), or -rar (multiple), followed by an
independent verb. These structures form medial-final chains (Longacre 2007).
Van Valin and La Polla (1997) call this type of clause linkage cosubordination, i.e.
dependency without embedding.
     Nothing can occur between the medial verb and the final verb. Also such
clauses cannot contain cataphoric pronominal reference (i.e. cannot refer forward
to something in a later clause). So medial chains are not subordinate, but neither
are they coordinate as their medial verbs are dependent on the final verb of the
chain for status marking.
                                                       Cosubordinate constructions          275
     In all three types of clause chains, negation occurs once and has scope over
the whole construction.
     Tayap cosubordinate constructions differ from serial verb constructions in
that medial verbs have an obligatory linking suffix, whereas non-final verbs in
serial verb constructions do not, and serial verb constructions generally form
a single phonological word whereas cosubordinate constructions do not (see
Section 8.2 for discussion of serial verb constructions).
     One unusual facet of Tayap’s medial-final constructions is that they do not
typically form the long chains that Papuan languages in general are so famous
for. The majority of medial-final chains in Tayap consist of a single medial verb
followed by a final verb. This might be in part because the final verb has to be a
verb of motion.
     An alternative analysis of these constructions, in particular -r and -kar, is that
they are adverbial suffixes, rendering an adverb from a verb. However a cosubor-
dinate analysis is preferred here as negation operates across clause boundaries
to cover the whole construction rather than negating the putative adverb directly
(see below, Section 9.8.2).","[285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295]"
"4.3.2 Ergativity in the speech of young peopleYoung villagers under thirty who narrated stories for me in Tayap produced erga-
tive constructions in their speech, but they had a tendency to overuse the ergative
markers on intransitive verbs. The subjects of intransitive verbs like ‘be’, ‘cry’,
‘stand’, ‘talk’, ‘shiver’ and ‘work’ were all marked with ergative case marking in
various young people’s narratives.
     Even when used in transitive verb phrases, the ergative morpheme was
sometimes attached to constituents that were not the subjects of the verb. For
example, one twenty-three-year-old man narrated a story about how a young girl
had accused him of having raped her.
     In telling the story, he said the following (note that the ellipsis denotes a
series of false starts and repetitions that have been omitted, and the ergative mor-
pheme is highlighted in bold):(4-38) Mosi katota namnin, ‘Ŋayarke yu Yengia…morasi aproyi nitukun’?

       ‘Mosi went down and told me ‘Is it true that you did something bad to
       Yengia?’
120          4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionThere are semantic and grammatical errors in this sentence,2 but of interest here
is the ergative clitic, which the speaker attaches to the object noun phrase ‘bad
deed’ instead of to the subject of the verb phrase, ‘you’.
     I suspect that this error occurred because the speaker seems to know that the
verb nir- (‘do’ or ‘make’) usually co-occurs with an ergative marker. But his sense
appears to be that the marker attaches to the noun or noun phrase that immedi-
ately precedes the verb; not necessarily the subject of the verb phrase.
     This is a typical error made by speakers under thirty. It indicates that young
speakers have parsed the ergative case marker as a formulaic part of a verb
phrase involving certain verbs – in particular, the verbs ‘know’, ‘say’ and ‘do’.
But these speakers seem to be not entirely aware that the marker does particular
syntactic and semantic work. If the ergative case clitic was really a strong marker
of agency, control or animacy one might expect speakers to be aware of that,
albeit subconsciously, and make mistakes accordingly; however that does not
seem to be the case.
     In addition to having problems with the placement and the function of
the ergative clitic, young speakers also often make mistakes of gender with it.
They overextend the feminine form =yi and use it when talking about males and
plural referents. So they say things like sas=yi (‘father=erg.f’, instead of sas=ŋi
‘father=erg.m’) and njenum=yi (dog.pl=erg.f, instead of the correct njenum=gi
‘dog.pl=erg.pl’).
     This overextension of =yi probably occurs because =yi is the ergative ending
on the 1sg and 2sg pronouns (ŋa=yi and yu=yi). Speakers would have heard the
yuyi form all their lives, every time an older speaker ordered them to carry or take
or fetch or hit something. And since the narratives that people in Gapun tell one
another are almost invariably accounts of personal experiences – what the nar-
rator him or herself saw, heard, dreamt, etc. – the ŋayi form would also be very
salient for speakers. Furthermore, the unmarked gender in Tayap is feminine see
Section 3.1.3. That young speakers would overextend the feminine form, rather
than the masculine =ŋi, is therefore not surprising.","[139, 140]"

1 The =re appears as =dre after n.
116       4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionFor those reasons, ŋɨ ŋgat poŋgɨn can potentially be understood to mean either
‘he speared the cassowary (with a spear)’ or ‘the cassowary struck him’ (that is,
pierced his body with the knife-like claws on its feet).
    Using the ergative case marker resolves ambiguity by marking the transitive
subject who performs the action. So compare:(4-30) a. ŋɨŋi ŋgat poŋgɨn
          ŋɨ=ŋi            ŋgat      po -ŋgɨ                         -n

          ‘the cassowary speared him’ (with its claws)Note that it is not the case that when two NPs (A and O) are present the ergative
marking must be used. The following example contains a verb that is highly tran-
sitive with two NP arguments present but there is no ergative:(4-31) ŋgɨ ŋgomar tarmbrar ŋgwok
       ŋgɨ ŋgomar tar            -mb       -rar ŋgwok
       3pl fish       take.irr -3pl.r.o -ml go.3pl.r
       ‘They picked up fish as they walked’However there are also many examples in which there can be no ambiguity, and
yet an ergative marker is used:(4-32) mbumjorŋi minjikankɨ nda kokɨr kukupemiet
       mbumjor=ŋi              minjikan -kɨ                nda     kokɨr

       bring -3sg.f.r.o rise_up.sg.m.r
       ‘the snake raised his head really close’One verb that virtually always marks its subject with the ergative clitic is kiraw-
when it conveys the meaning of ‘know’ (this verb also has a range of other
meanings, including ‘consider something’, ‘recognize something’ and ‘taste
something’); note that this example has the unusual structure of a preposed
head, with possessive phrase following.

The main function of ergative clitics is to mark the subject of a transitive verb.
In Tayap, however, the ergative marker can also be attached to the subject of an
intransitive verb.
     This marked use often carries a particular nuance, which can be illustrated
by an example taken from a narrative about a powerful crocodile water-spirit
named Ŋgayam. In telling this story, the narrator uses the ergative with an intran-
sitive verb:(4-35) Ŋgayamŋi mbet
       Ŋgayam =ŋi    mbet
       Ŋgayam =erg.m come.3sg.m.r
       ‘Ŋgayam came’
118       4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionThe ergative here carries the connotation of purposefulness. The implication
is that Ŋgayam didn’t just come – he came with a purpose, to do something, to
perform some kind of action. And indeed he did: the story tells of how Ŋgayam
flooded the rainforest and drowned an entire kin group as they stood gathering
his children – who had the form of fish – in his jungle streams. A version of this
story appears at the end of this grammar as Tayap Text 2.
     Another telling instance of an ergative marker on an intransitive verb
occurred once when men from the neighboring village of Sanae arrived in
Gapun unannounced a few days after one of their relatives had been attacked
by a Gapuner. Everyone in Gapun was fearful of the Sanae men, because it was
assumed that they had come to fatally bewitch the attacker or one of his matri-
lineal relatives. As the Sanae men arrived in Gapun, villagers whispered to one
another:(4-36) Merewŋgrogi ŋgwek
       Merew -ŋgro =gi           ŋgwek
       Sanae -pl       =erg.pl come.3pl.r
       ‘the Sanae [men] are coming’The use of the ergative in this case meant that the Sanae men were not just drop-
ping by Gapun on an innocent visit to socialize. They were coming to accomplish
a particular sinister purpose.
    This use of the ergative to mark intentionality on intransitive verbs is also
apparent in cases where the ergative is used to denote a remarked-upon lack of
intentionality. The following example was uttered by a woman screaming abuse
at her relatives because her nephew littered the ground in front of her house with
seeds he blew from a homemade pea-shooter (i.e. in front of the house of the
woman having the “kros”, see Kulick 1992: 104–113 and Kulick 1993 for details on
these kinds of antagonistic speech events):(4-37) yumŋni mburaiakaku wákare!
       yum =ŋi          mburai     -ak           aku       wákare
       2pl =erg.m sweep.irr -link                be.irr    neg
       ‘you all never sweep!’Here the ergative clitic on an intransitive verb (mburai ‘sweep’) inflected in the
negative habitual aspect (see Section 8.3.2) highlights the consistent lack of
intention on the part of her addressees to perform an act that she thinks they
ought to consider doing occasionally.
                                                     The ergative case (erg)    119
    Suter’s (2010) description of optional ergativity in the Trans New Guinea
language Kâte shows that the ergative marker is most likely to be used in
clauses with the marked word order of OSV (as opposed to the usual SOV) or
when a focus particle is used on the subject (Suter 2010: 435). In other Trans
New Guinea languages, factors include animacy, agency and control (Suter
2010: 436).
    As we have seen, however, there seems to be no single factor or group of
factors which account for the use or absence of the ergative marker in Tayap.","[135, 136, 137, 138, 139]"
"Grammatical words generally coincide with phonological words in Tayap
(however see Section 8.2, example (8–3) for a counter-example). Grammatical
words consist of “a number of grammatical elements which (i) always occur
together rather than scattered throughout the clause (…); (ii) occur in fixed order;
and (iii) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning” (Aikhenvald 2007: 2).
     In Tayap, verbs are grammatical words which minimally must always occur
with person and/or status marking except in certain restricted morphosyntac-
tic environments. Even the longest and most complex of the complex predicates
described in Chapters 8 and 9 consist of single grammatical words, sharing as they
do various properties like marking for arguments and/or realis/irrealis status. Thus
the example discussed in detail in Chapter 8, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana, ‘she intends to
carry him down on her shoulders’, is a single phonological and grammatical word.
     However grammatical words do not necessarily have to be inflected. Verbs
are normally inflected, but nouns, pronouns, particles and other minor classes
can occur without inflection.
                                                               Orthography        45
2.8 OrthographyThe Tayap orthography in this grammar and dictionary uses letters of the English
alphabet that correspond to the language’s phonemes, with two exceptions: ɨ
and ŋ. The phonemes /ɵ/ and /ŋ/ would be difficult to render using the letters
used to write English or Tok Pisin. Tayap is almost never written, and any villager
who does so invents his or her own nonce orthography. In my years of contact with
the villagers, I have received many letters from them, always written in Tok Pisin.
At the very end of these letters, though, after the writer has finished asking me for
money (which is always the sole reason for sending me a letter), he or she often
concludes with a line written in Tayap, to add coercive punch to the requests.
     A typical example is the phrase Aowo grag engon yu na na, which occurred at
the very end of a letter that had just instructed me to send the writer the equiva-
lent of $8,000 (at a time when the yearly income for the entire village was about
$500). The interjection aowo is an orthographic rendering of a sound used by
villagers to convey worry and longing, and the rest, ‘good evening to you’, is a
Tayap calque of Tok Pisin’s “gutpela apinun long yu”. The unambiguous meaning
of the Tayap phrase is: ‘I worry about you, so now you worry about me and send
me eight thousand dollars’.
     The orthography that villagers have come up with to write Tayap varies from
writer to writer and from occasion to occasion. However, one convention that has
developed over the years regards /ɵ/, which is sometimes written as h, and /ŋ/,
which is often rendered as either nh or ngh. This convention may be the invention
of Amburi Waiki, who was in his late twenties and the village prayer leader in the
mid-1980s. Amburi was the only person in Gapun to write anything in Tayap at
that time, and his orthography – which he himself applied erratically – was seen
by others and perhaps adopted by them. (What Amburi wrote on loose pages and
in school workbooks were the names of villagers who had contributed money to
the village church, and the names of areas of rainforest that he wanted to note
down for various reasons.)
     This way of handling Tayap’s phonemes results in a sentence like the follow-
ing, which Amburi wrote down for me in the 1980s: Ngha nghing ana mbet (‘I have
come for them’).
     The problem with the orthography used to write this sentence is that it is
difficult for villagers to parse and read. It makes no distinction between free and
bound morphemes (-ana, ‘for’ or ‘to’, for example, is a bound morpheme that
cannot occur on its own), and literate villagers, who have learned to read by being
drilled in school with texts in English, have difficulty with the sheer number of
letters used to denote simple sounds. (In the orthography used in this grammar
and dictionary the sentence would be written Ŋa ŋgɨnana mbet.)
46        2 Phonology and orthography      A sentence produced in 2009 by a literate villager who I asked to demonstrate
to me how he would write something in Tayap shows that the same problems
have persisted: Nhang nhan patir engon nhayar (‘My house is very nice’). The
orthography is internally inconsistent – the word written engon is pronounced
[εŋgɔn], and thus should be written enhgon, if the conventions of this orthogra-
phy were followed consistently.
      This orthography also quickly gets messy. For example, in the sentence just
quoted, a common word like ŋaŋan (‘my’) is written as two words and spelled
nhang nhan. In other instances, simple pronouns like ŋɨ [ŋɵ] (‘he’) and ŋgɨ [ŋgɵ]
(‘they’) tend to stump village writers, who might write them as nghi and nghgh,
respectively – although they would more likely avoid writing them or give up
trying to write them.
      Words with the consonant cluster /ŋg/ also pose difficulties. A name like
‘Saŋgi’ – which the villagers’ orthography should render as something like
Sanhgi – looks strange to the villagers when they see it written out in this way
(they would in this case write ‘Sangi’). Worse, a name like ‘Saŋgiŋgi’, which
might be written something like Sanhginhgi, would make villagers who try to use
their invented orthography throw up their hands in despair.
      Because of those difficulties, which villagers perceive and talk about them-
selves, I do not adopt their orthographic inventions to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/. Instead, I
introduce two additional letters, ɨ and ŋ. These letters are ordered so that ɨ follows
i in the alphabet, and ŋ follows n.
      While I depart from the villagers’ attempts to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/, I do follow
their loose convention of orthographically marking prenasalization on the voiced
word-initial stops /b/ and /d/ and on the affricate /dʒ/. Villagers vary on whether
or not they orthographically mark word-initial nasalization on the velar stop
/g/: a word like ‘cassowary’, spelled ŋgat in this orthography, would probably be
written ngat by most villagers.
      On the other hand, though, some of them write ŋgrag ‘evening’ as grag (see
above, the example of a villager’s letter asking me for $8,000). Regardless of how
they would write a word-initial /g/, however, Tayap speakers consistently prena-
salize the phoneme when they pronounce it in this position. Hence, I mark this
in the orthography.
      This concession to village pronunciation and writing conventions means that
the orthography used here is not as economical as it otherwise might have been.
I could have omitted the nasalization in words beginning with /b/, /d/, /j/ and
/g/ and simply noted that those phonemes are all obligatorily nasalized word-
initially (this is what Christopher Stroud and I did in our 1993 sketch grammar).
      In the end, though, I decided that since the only people who might conceiv-
ably ever actually use the orthography employed here are the speakers of Tayap,
                                                                 Orthography        47
their perceptual biases and already-established habits were more important than
an economical orthography. As I just noted, villagers who write anything in Tayap
vary in whether or not they mark the prenasalization before a word-initial /g/. But
they would find it counter-intuitive and odd to see or write bor ‘pig’, je ‘dog’ or der
‘path’ when they say – and would write – mbor, nje and nder.
     I therefore write words the way the villagers pronounce them, with the result
that there are no words in the dictionary that begin orthographically with b, d, j
or g.
     Word-medial and word-final prenasalized consonants are written as they are
most commonly pronounced, thus the j in munje ‘man’ is written as prenasalized,
as it is normally pronounced, versus mbubujiram ‘bubbles from fish, crocodiles,
turtles emerging from underwater’, which is written unprenasalized.
     This orthographic convention would also logically entail changing the spell-
ing of the villagers’ home, Gapun, to Ŋgapun. However, ‘Gapun’ is not a Tayap
word. Senior men in the 1980s told me that they had heard that Germans had
given the name Gapun to their village – which is called Tayap num ‘Tayap village’
in Tayap.
     No one knows why ‘Gapun’ was chosen, but the most likely explanation is
that when German cartographers and labor recruiters first appeared in the lower
Sepik area in the early decades of the 1900s, they asked coastal villagers the
names of inland villages which they could not reach, and they wrote down some
version of the names they received in response. The Kopar-language name for
Gapun, for example, is Saŋgap.
     No great leap of imagination is required to see how a name like that, through
various mis-hearings and confusions, could end up as Gapun. A significant per-
centage of the colonial records from the lower Sepik area were destroyed during
WWII, so I have been unable to uncover any information that directly sheds light
on the question of why Gapun is called Gapun.
     But whatever the story behind the German naming of the village may be, the
spelling of ‘Gapun’ can remain unchanged, since it is not a Tayap word.
     Note that stress is marked where it is a property of a lexical morpheme (for
example, wákare (‘no’), but in the rest of the grammar it is not marked it when it
is a product of complex morpho-phonemics e.g. like kakúndara in (2-14a) above.
     Out of respect for villagers’ writing habits (and also to be consistent with the
analysis of the language’s phonology discussed above, where no VVV clusters
are permitted), I have also changed the spelling of the name of the language and
people from Taiap – as I have spelled it in all my previous work on Gapun – to
Tayap.
     Whenever villagers write their name for themselves, they always spell it
Tayap. And the word is a popular one to write. The front of one house near the
48        2 Phonology and orthographycenter of the village, for example, is adorned with large letters, painted in black
battery acid, that proclaims (tellingly, in Tok Pisin), NIU LUK TAYAP (‘New Look
Tayap’).
     Another young man, upping the linguistic ante in the direction of what many
villagers have understood is the even more prestigious language, used similar
material to paint the words NEW HOME TAYAP on a wall in his house.
     A young man with whom I was walking along the beach one day, making
the six-hour trip to the village of Watam to see if the local health worker there
had any medicine for a bad case of scabies I had acquired in the village (she
didn’t), paused at one point to scratch the words NICK OUTCAST PERSON K*B*H*
ROR TAYAP MUNJE into the sand. Translated, this means ‘Nick outcast person
K[ambedagam] B[lue] H[ill] child Tayap man’ – the K*B*H* part of the message
being a name the young villagers have given to their mountain.
     Nick’s scribble in the sand doesn’t make much sense in either of the two lan-
guages in which it is written. But that is typical of the way that the word Tayap is
used in young villagers’ writing: it is used more as a marker or a tag than as an
attempt to convey referential meaning. Nick’s writing is a slightly more elaborate
variant of the words Tayap ror (Tayap child), which is a popular tag that young
men and women like to carve into trees or add after their signature at the end of
a love letter. The words are modeled on the Tok Pisin word “mangi”, which used
to mean ‘child’, but which during the past thirty years has acquired the sassier
meaning of ‘young person’ or, better, ‘kid’.
3 Word classesTayap has two open classes of words – nouns (Section 3.1) and verbs (Section 3.2) –
and a number of closed classes:     3.3 adjectives                  3.8 deictics
     3.4 adverbs                     3.9 interrogatives
     3.5 pronouns                    3.10 interjections and affect words
     3.6 quantifiers                 3.11 intensifiers and discourse markers
     3.7 articles                    3.12 mood particlesThe properties of Tayap’s word classes are discussed in the sections below.","[64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69]"

Most of these kin terms, and certainly their dual and plural forms, are mori-
bund. Several of them – oiŋga ‘daughter-in-law, woman speaking’, njanimb
‘great-grandchild’, ombre ‘father-in-law, male speaking’, otre ‘mother-in-law,
male speaking’ – were produced only after several conversations among Gapun’s
oldest Tayap speakers. There is disagreement about whether one of them – eŋki,
‘husband of maternal aunt, male speaking’ – is even a Tayap word. Several people
suggested that it might be a borrowing from the Adjora language spoken in the
                                                                       Nouns        53
nearby village, Sanae. However, since old men in the 1980s told me it was, and
since it has a Tayap plural, I include it here.
     Villagers under forty all know common words like munje ‘man’, noŋor ‘woman’
and ror ‘child’, and they know their plural forms, but most do not know their dual
forms. Most kin terms have been either forgotten or replaced with words from Tok
Pisin. So oyeŋg ‘in-law’ has been replaced by Tok Pisin’s “tambu”, neni ‘grandfa-
ther’ has been replaced with “apa man”, and keke ‘grandmother’ with “apa meri”.
     Words like mambrag ‘spirit of a dead person’ and kandap ‘forest being’ are kept
alive by mothers who use them to frighten their small children, so everyone knows
them. The plural forms, however, are not known by speakers under thirty-five.
     The two non-human nouns that have plural forms are:

3.1.2 The animacy/genericness distinction in nounsThe animate-inanimate/generic distinction is fundamental in Tayap, and is
marked by two kinds of morphemes that are attached to nouns.
    The first are peripheral case clitics, that denote relations like location or
dative (see Section 4.4). Several of these clitics have different forms for animate
and inanimate/generic referents. Note, for example, the different clitics that
express movement towards something or someone – an animate referent takes
=re and an inanimate referent takes =nɨ (see Section 4.4 for the complexities of
the animate/inanimate division):(3-12) a. ŋgu    Mairum =re                wok
          3sg.f Mairum =all (animate) go.3sg.f.r
          ‘she went to Mairum (personal name)’       b. ŋgu    mɨri         =nɨ           wok
          3sg.f rainforest =all (inanimate) go.3sg.f.r
          ‘she went to the rainforest’
3.1.2.1 Animacy/genericness marked through possessive morphemes
Animacy/genericness is also marked on NPs by the enclitics that signal possession
(see Section 4.5 for discussion of possession). The possessive clitics express animacy/
54       3 Word classesgenericness and number. They have optional consonant-final forms: The condition-
ing factors between the vowel-final and consonant-final forms are unknown.

          pig      =poss tail
          ‘pig’s tail’       b. Sopak =mat sapwar
          Sopak =poss basket
          ‘Sopak’s basket’       c. mɨri         =mat mbor
          rainforest =poss pig
          ‘wild pig’ – as opposed to a numŋa mbor, a domestic pig, of the village       d. num      sami =mat morasi
          village many =poss custom
          ‘the custom of many villages’The possessive clitics attach to the last word of the noun phrase expressing the pos-
sessor. The order between possessor and possessed is free, so both Sopak=ma(t)
sapwar (Sopak’s basket) and sapwar Sopak=ma(t) (basket Sopak’s), or mɨri=ŋa
mbor (forest’s pig) and mbor mɨri=ŋa (pig forest’s) are possible. Placing the np +
poss constituent last emphasizes it.
    For animate plurals, the possessive clitic is =mandama(t). For example:(3-14) a. Potow     =mandamat morasi
          Wongan =poss.pl         behavior
          ‘the behavior of the Wongan people’       b. mbor rorsem =mandama tawk
          pig    child.pl =poss.pl         plate
          ‘the baby pigs’ plate’ (that they eat from)When speaking in general terms, =ŋa(n) is used even with animate nouns. For
example:
                                                                     Nouns          55

3.1.3 Gender in nounsGender is a ubiquitous feature of Tayap. A common category in Papuan languages
in general (Foley 2000: 371), in particular in non-Trans New Guinea languages
(Ger Reesink pers. comm.), the pervasiveness of gender in Tayap, and the way it is
marked across the grammar, differentiates it from the languages that surround it
and gives it a reputation in the area as being a “hard” language.
    Non-speakers of Tayap perceive the prominent role that gender marking
plays in Tayap because they hear speakers telling one another to do things, and
the imperative forms of intransitive verbs are inflected according to the gender
(and number) of the addressee(s).
    So – to use the example that Gapun villagers themselves inevitably cite
whenever they explain the nature of Tayap to anyone – when you talk to a man
56       3 Word classesyou say wetet (come), and when you talk to a woman you say wetak (come), using
gender-marked verbal affixes.
     This feature of the language never ceases to astonish any Sepik villager who
hears it, and people from other villages who listen to Gapuners explain that they
have “two languages” invariably react as though such a language is so bizarre as
to stretch the bounds of credulity (see Section 7.1.2; see also Sections 3.5 and 5.3
for gender marking on pronouns and verbal affixes).","[72, 73, 74, 75, 76]"
"4.6 Peripheral case marking in young people’s TayapFor the most part, young people retain the ability to produce correct peripheral case
marking. They generally uphold the animate-inanimate distinction, and they cor-
rectly use the locative case. Locative =re sometimes causes problems when speakers
have analyzed words to which it attaches as whole constituents. So emb=re ‘in the
morning’ (morning=loc) is heard so often that it has been lexicalized by many young
speakers to mean ‘morning’, with the result that when they say ‘in the morning’,
they add the locative clitic and produce emb=re=re (lit. ‘in in the morning’).
     Animate referents generally receive correct dative and locative marking. The
locative =nɨ on inanimate referents, however, is over-extended, probably because
of interference with Tok Pisin’s “long”. “Long” is a preposition that covers all the
meanings of Tayap’s various peripheral case markers, including ‘to’, ‘in’ and ‘for’.
So speakers say things like:(4-62)  a. oyaŋnɨ subimnakara
           oyaŋ    =nɨ       subim            -nak            -ara
           clam    =loc      dive (TP)        -1sg.f|1pl.r    -perf
           ‘we dived for clams’ (lit. ‘we dived to clams’)
instead of
        b. oyaŋana amaipikun
           oyaŋ =ana amaipi                 -ku-          -n
           clam =dat look_for.r             -3sg.f.r.o- -sg|1pl.r.s
           ‘we looked for clams’(4-63)   a. Mapismat yimbarnɨ yim mbok
            Mapis =mat yimbar =nɨ          yim mbok
            Mapis =poss canoe =loc 1pl go.3sg.f|1pl.r
            ‘we went inside Mapis’s canoe’instead of
        b. Mapismat yimbarekenɨ yim mbok
           Mapis =mat yimbar =ekenɨ yim mbok
           Mapis =poss canoe =perl 1pl go.3sg.f|1pl.r
           ‘we went by way of Mapis’s canoe’Tok Pisin also influences the syntax of the case markers. A twenty-two-year-old
man produced the following sentence:
                              Peripheral case marking in young people’s Tayap   135
(4-64)    *ŋgɨ nunuk ŋa =nɨ       ŋgwek
          3pl after      1sg =loc come.3pl.r
          ‘they came after me’The individual constituents that compose this sentence are all grammatically
correct. The problem is that the young man’s sentence is a calque of the Tok Pisin
sentence:(4-65)    ol    i           kam bihain long            mi
          3pl predicate come after     prep           1sg
                marker4
          ‘they came after me’Notice that the locative clitic in the speaker’s Tayap sentence in (4-64) combines
with the 1sg pronoun (ŋanɨ) – just like the preposition in the Tok Pisin sentence
“long mi”. But while correct in Tok Pisin, the speaker’s Tayap is ungrammatical.
What he wants is as follows:(4-66)     ŋgɨ ŋaŋan        nunuk    =nɨ      ŋgwek
           3pl 1sg.poss after        =loc     come.3pl.r
           ‘they came after me’A final consistent error made by speakers under thirty is that they use the locative
clitic to refer to named areas of the rainforest, whereas in Tayap convention these
nouns are bare adjuncts. So instead of saying yim mbok Konjamoran (‘we went
to Konjamoran’ – with no clitic added to Konjamoran, which is a named area of
the rainforest), young speakers consistently add a locative clitic, and say either
yim mbok Konjamoran=re, or yim mbok Konjamoran=nɨ, using the case marker for
villages (=re) or for unnamed places (=nɨ).
     Young speakers may be doing this on the pattern of Tok Pisin, where such
marking, by the preposition “long”, is obligatory – in Tok Pisin, ‘we went to
Konjamoran’ would be “mipela igo long Konjamoran”.
     But they may also be using locative markers because it is logical to do so in
Tayap: that fluent speakers do not use the locative endings on named areas of
the rainforest is a marked feature of this system. An alternative explanation of
why young speakers use the locative clitic here is thus that they are regularizing
Tayap’s case marking system.","[154, 155]"

"3.4.4 Adverbials of frequency and distribution and ‘not yet’Two adverbials in Tayap express frequency and distribution (-re), and the tem-
poral relationship ‘not yet’ (ŋgo wákare). Note the formal parallel with the loca-
tive =re (see Section 3.4.3 above and Section 4.4); presumably these forms, while
having different functions, have the same origin. The suffix -re occurs on nouns,
and always involves reduplication, as the following examples show.-re ‘every’(3-64) a. Yu nimenda nirakkut arore arore. Rorsem aikindaka ambukenɨ
          nirakkut? Hariap kwik nirakkut.

            ‘he hasn’t spoken yet’3.4.5 Elevational and positional adverbialsThe relative geographical position of objects and people is expressed in Tayap
much more frequently than it is in a language like English. When leaving
someone’s company, for example, one doesn’t just say ‘I’m going’, but rather,
‘I’m going up (in the direction of the rainforest)’ or ‘I’m going down (in the
direction of the mangrove lagoon)’. Similarly, if you have just arrived back
in Gapun from a trip to the village of Wongan, and someone asks you where
you have been, the correct answer is not ‘I was in Wongan’, but ‘I was down
in Wongan’.
     Elevational and positional relationships are lexically encoded in Tayap’s rich
set of verbs of motion, virtually all of which are being lost because of their irreg-
ular inflectional patterns (see Section 6.2.3). But Tayap also has a set of two free-
standing elevationals and seven positionals that are used to pinpoint the location
of an object or a person.
     Four of these are oriented according to a spatial array consisting of two axes.
                                                                   Adverbs      81

MANGROVE LAGOON                        down sire
     The vertical axis refers to the spatial elevationals of ‘up’ and ‘down’, for
instance being up in a tree or down on the ground.
     The horizontal axis refers to the geographical relationship between the rain-
forest and the mangrove lagoon. The mangrove lagoon that villagers have to cross
to get to the neighboring village of Wongan runs to the sea and lies to the north
of Gapun. The rainforest, in which the villagers live and into which they walk
every day to find sago palms to process and game to hunt, lies all around the
village, but most of the vast areas of their traditional land lies roughly south of
Gapun. In relation to the mighty Sepik River, which can be seen from the top of
the mountain where Gapun village was situated until after World War II, the man-
grove lagoon is ‘downstream’, and the rainforest is ‘upstream’. This is the sense
in which villagers say they went ‘down’ to Wongan and then came back ‘up’ to
Gapun. These directionals are relative to one another, so that when one has gone
‘up’ into the rainforest, one comes ‘down’ to Gapun village when one returns.
Note that the terms also cover all space within the village.
     The five other freestanding positionals are:    ari   ‘below’, in the sense of ‘down below’ on a slope
    ase   ‘beside’, ‘on the edge of’, ‘on the periphery of’
    aro   ‘inside’, in the sense of ‘enveloped in or covered by’
    ato   ‘outside’, ‘on the exterior of’
    osi   ‘on the other side’So, for example, in response to the question ‘Where is it?’, one might respond in
any of the following ways:

They can also be used as verbs in serial verb constructions, indicating motion, for
example (see Section 8.2):(3-69) yimbar ŋaŋan mbɨukuasetak
       yimbar ŋaŋan mbɨu -ku                   -ase -tak
       canoe mine pull.r -3sg.f.r.o            -edge -2sg.f|3sg.f.r.s
       ‘She pulled my canoe outside’ (i.e. she pulled it from inside the rainforest
       out into the open)In addition to the freestanding elevationals and positionals, Tayap also has a
number of complex positionals, all but one of which (mborki) are nouns attached
with the locative clitic =nɨ.    imin=nɨ          ‘inside’ or ‘underneath’ (lit. ‘belly’ + loc)
    kandaŋ=nɨ        ‘under’, ‘at the base of’ (lit. ‘base’ + loc)
    mbokak=nɨ        ‘on top of’ (lit. ‘surface’ + loc)
    mborki=nɨ        ‘outside’, ‘visible, out in the open’
    mbwar=nɨ         ‘behind’ or ‘on’ (lit. ‘back’ + loc)
    nunuk=nɨ         ‘behind’ (lit. ‘back side’ + loc)
    orom=nɨ          ‘in the middle’ (lit. ‘middle’ + loc)
    raw=nɨ           ‘facing’ or ‘in front of’ (lit. ‘nose’ + loc)
    sek=nɨ           ‘underneath’ (lit. ‘underside’ + loc)
    taw=nɨ           ‘beside’ (lit. ‘side’ + loc)
The above positionals are nouns that can occur on their own – so one can say:(3-70)   raw =nɨ         aŋgi wuk
         nose =loc dx.f be.3sg.f.r
         ‘it’s in front’But speakers also frequently combine locative positionals like rawnɨ with the free-
standing elevationals and positionals, as well as more complex elements like the
possessive-marked noun in (3-71a–c), to specify location. One of the tests I did for
positionals was to put a plastic box in the middle of my floor and then put a torch
(i.e. a flashlight) in various positions in, under, behind, etc. the box. Some of the
positionals I elicited in this way are as follows (Note: tos ‘torch’ and kontena ‘box’
or ‘container’ are Tok Pisin words):
84        3 Word classes(3-71)   a. tos     kontena =ŋa         mbwar =nɨ  wo wuk

            ‘the torch is underneath the box’In addition to the elevationals and positionals discussed above, Tayap has two
further spatial adverbials that denote relative distance: kemrak ‘far away’ and
menjikan ‘nearby’. Examples are:(3-72)   a. ŋɨ ŋgɨnana kemrak puŋgot
            ŋɨ       ŋgɨ   = nana kemrak       puŋgot

            ‘the plate is there near your leg’3.5 PronounsTayap has a single set of pronouns that occur in three different cases: absolutive,
ergative and possessive.
     The possessive pronouns are formed by adding the possessive clitic = ŋa(n)
to the absolutive-case pronouns (with some irregularities), and the ergative pro-
nouns are formed by adding the nominal ergative clitics (see Section 4.3) to the
absolutive forms, again with some irregularities. Note that bound pronominal
forms are listed below and discussed in Section 5.3.","[99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104]"

               ‘I’m dying to pee’ (lit. ‘urine is cutting the belly to me’; i.e. ‘my belly’)As noted above, ergative markers are clitics. They attach to the last element in
a noun phrase, and not just to the head noun (cf. Spencer and Luís 2012: 2). An
example of how they can attach to deictics and possessive pronouns that together
with their head noun compose a noun phrase is the following:(4-21)   awin sawirŋa ror aindetŋi tɨk ŋgunukun
         awin sawir =ŋa           ror     aindet           =ŋi        tɨk

         ‘that young man from Black Water told a story’ (lit. ‘put a story’)Ergative morphemes also cliticize to the interrogative word ani ‘who’, resulting in

There are also sets of object-marking suffixes, for the benefactive mood (Section
7.5), also used in the transitive progressive (Section 8.3.1.2), and also for non-final
verbs (Section 8.2). These forms are as follows, repeated here for convenience
(note that these forms are perhaps better organized by number than person, but
to parallel other paradigms they are organized here by person):

There is a lack of parallelism between pronouns and verb morphology, in the
sense that for all singular subjects, including 1sg, gender is obligatorily marked
on verbs through various means that for some verb classes includes changes in
the verb stem itself.
    For example, note how the imperfective form of the verb ‘go’ (o) changes to
express gender for singular subjects:Person       Gender        Pronoun         verb1sg          f             ŋa              mbok       ‘I went’ (female speaking)
1sg          m             ŋa              mbot       ‘I went’ (male speaking)
2sg          f             yu              mbok       ‘you went’ (female referent)
2sg          m             yu              mbot       ‘you went’ (male referent)
3sg          f             ŋgu             wok        ‘she went’
3sg          m             ŋɨ              mbot       ‘he went’
86        3 Word classes     Gender is expressed in the verb here for all singular subjects. The free pro-
nominal system, however, does not manifest a gender distinction in first or
second person: feminine and masculine first-person singular are both ŋa; femi-
nine and masculine second-person singular are both yu. The pronominal system
distinguishes gender only in third-person singular (ŋɨ ‘he’ and ŋgu ‘she’). For
plural subjects, there is no gender distinction, neither in the pronominal system
nor in the morphology of verbs.
     A further divergence between the pronominal system and verb morphology is
that Tayap, as noted above, has no separate dual pronoun, but it does have a dual
verb inflection for both transitive verbs (-re) and intransitive verbs (-tike). This
inflection signals ‘we two’ (1dl) or ‘the two of them’ (3dl).
     Note, though, that ‘you two’ (2dl) is expressed with the second person plural
(yum) form of the verb. Compare:(3-73)   a. dual

            ‘you all ate it’ or ‘the two of you ate it’To specify duality for 2pl subjects, one must be explicit and say the word sene
‘two’. So the following sentence means ‘the two of you ate it’:
                                                                Quantifiers      87

         ‘the two of you ate it’A further divergence between free pronouns and verb morphology is that free
pronouns operate under an ergative/absolutive alignment system whereas verbal
morphology operates under a nominative/accusative system (see Section 4.3).","[105, 106, 107]"

able to host realis/irrealis status and transitivity suffixes as well as subject and
object suffixes. A fully inflected verb can function as the sole word of a sentence.
    There are two major subclasses of verbs: intransitive and transitive. Examples
of each are:Intransitive verb(3-28) ŋgu pirok
       ŋgu     pirok
       3sg.f laugh.sg.f|1sg.pl.r

       1sg=erg.f 2sg see.r -s <2sg.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.s
       ‘I saw you’There are no ditransitive verbs in Tayap (see also Section 9.1). Semantically three-
place predicates express the recipient of giving, for example, with the benefactive
morpheme:(3-30) is        -iata        -n
       give.sbj -1sg.ben.r.o -sg|1pl.r
       ‘(you) give it to me!’However the recipient can be omitted, indicating that the verb in question is tran-
sitive, not ditransitive, and that the benefactive morpheme is an optional oblique
argument:(3-31) epi           i           -kru       -net
       tomorrow give.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s
       ‘I (m) will give it (to someone) tomorrow’Benefactive objects and regular objects cannot coocur in the same clause.
     As well as being divided into transitivity classes, every Tayap verb falls
into one of nine conjugation classes, based on how verbs form their non-future
forms: there are five classes for transitive verbs and four for intransitives (see
Chapter 6).
     Verb morphology in Tayap is entirely suffixing, with morphemes for object
and subject added – in that order, apart from discontinuous subject markers – to
verb stems. A characteristic feature of Tayap verbs is that status is marked across
the verb multiple times. The stem must occur in either an irrealis or realis form.
In addition, the object and subject morphemes that get suffixed to the stem also
encode realis/irrealis status.
     This can be illustrated with an example from the transitive verb stem o, which
means ‘strike’ (and covers actions like ‘shoot’, ‘stab’ and ‘hit’). Note how irrealis
vs. realis is marked across the verb (in bold):

ways. Realis morphemes can occur as part of a verb that refers to an unreal event.
An example is the counterfactual mood (cf), which is a prototypical irrealis cate-
gory, because it refers to events that never occurred, such as ‘If he had seen it, he
would have shot it’. However in Tayap, on transitive verbs, the counterfactual is2 Note that the negative verb requires irrealis marking, see Section 5.4.2.1.

subject morphemes that occur in their realis forms, rather than in their irrealis

as counterfactual and suffixed by group I subject morphemes, which in this
grammar – for the sake of consistency with the pattern that is clear in transitive
verbs – are glossed as realis. In reality, though, group I subject morphemes are
the same in the realis and irrealis statuses (see Section 6.2.1).(3-35) memrɨknet

"3.1.3.2 Principles of gender assignment
There are two genders in Tayap: feminine and masculine. Humans have natural
gender, even though this can be overridden when the referent is non-particular
(see below). The gender classification of all other animate nouns is decided by
three criteria.
58          3 Word classes    The first is particularity: the unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including
animate nouns, is feminine.1
    The second is sex: a male referent may be specified as masculine and a female
referent feminine.
    The third criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be
masculine; short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine.
    Snakes (long and thin) and cassowaries (tall and imposing), therefore, are
prototypically masculine; pigs (fat and stocky) are prototypically feminine. So in
a sentence like ‘he speared a pig’, the object ‘pig’ will be designated by the femi-
nine object suffix -ku unless the speaker specifically wants to point out that it was
male, in which case the masculine object suffix -ŋgɨ would be used.
    The difference is as follows:(3-19) a. ŋɨŋi mbor pokun
          ŋɨ      =ŋi       mbor po         -ku                       -n
          3sg.m =erg.m pig         strike.r -3sg.f.r.o                -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘he speared a (female) pig’        b. ŋɨŋi mbor poŋgɨn
           ŋɨ      =ŋi      mbor po           -ŋgɨ       -n
           3sg.m =erg.m pig          strike.r -3sg.m.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
           ‘he speared a (male) pig’The following chart shows the process of gender assignment in Tayap:
                                              Is it particular?
                                          yes               no                                   is it male?             feminine
                             yes                 no
                                                 feminine      shape long?                      shape stocky?
      yes       no                     yes            nomasculine       feminine           feminine           masculineTayap gender decision tree
1 Foley (2000: 371) notes that among those Papuan languages which have gender, binary con-
trasts are typical, and feminine is always the unmarked gender.
                                                                     Nouns           59
     As the chart suggests, even though snakes and cassowaries are commonly
masculine, a short, fat snake or a squat, short-necked cassowary could be referred
to using feminine forms.
     The shape-based assignment of gender is not entirely predictable, however.
A praying mantis is generally masculine, perhaps because its name is homopho-
nous with ‘cassowary’ (i.e. ŋgat). And a millipede (kakámatik), even though it is
long, is generally feminine, perhaps because it is stubby, fat, and slow moving,
at least compared to a centipede (yandum), which is sleek and slithering (and
generally masculine).
     Even though nouns tend to be generally classified as feminine, there are
some nouns which are always (in the case of natural phenomena and insects) or
tend to be (in the case of animals and birds) masculine.
     The nouns in question are:Natural phenomena       Animals, birds and insectsarawer ‘sun’            aram ‘snake’                    ŋgararik ‘monitor lizard’
ŋgudum ‘star’           kakarpwap ‘eagle’               ŋgat ‘cassowary’; ‘praying
nekan ‘earthquake’      kamban ‘magpie’                 mantis’
aruat ‘thunder’         kekékato ‘worm’                 njakep ‘flying fox bat’
pora ‘wind’             momɨk ‘guria pigeon’            ondom ‘hornbill’
urerŋgar ‘lightning’    nekan ‘stick insect’, Note:     orem ‘crocodile’
                        homophonous with ‘earthquake’   pesaw ‘bird of paradise’
                                                        yandum ‘centipede’
Examples are:(3-20) nekan        katot
       earthquake happen.3sg.m.r
       ‘an earthquake (m) happened’(3-21) ŋayi aram tanɨŋgɨn
       ŋa =yi          aram ta -nɨ -ŋgɨ      -n
       1sg =erg.f snake see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r. s
       ‘I (f) saw a snake (m)’This gender system shares some similarity with the East Sepik, Ndu family lan-
guage Manambu, in which gender assignment is determined in part by the size
and shape of the referent (Aikhenvald et al. 2008; see also Reesink 2003 on North
Papuan languages). Aikhenvald et al. (2008: 112) note that shape-based gender
assignment is a feature of languages of the Sepik area, also citing Alamblak (Bruce
60        3 Word classes1984). Other languages of the Sepik-Ramu region have gender, but very different
systems: Foley (2000: 366) notes for instance that Lower Sepik languages have a
phonological gender system; that is, gender assignment is based on the phono-
logical form of the noun root.
    On the other hand, the situational element to Tayap’s gender system – in
which gender is partly a matter of the discourse situation rather than a fixed
property of a noun – is reminiscent of that of Bilua, a Papuan language spoken
on Vella Lavella in the Solomon Islands. In Bilua, masculine gender is used
for third-person singular masculine human referents as well as “singulative”
non-human nouns. But all other nouns are marked feminine, the default form
(Obata 2003: 88, 105–109).","[77, 78, 79, 80]"
"3.6 Quantifiers3.6.1 CountingThe traditional counting system in Tayap was based on a person’s fingers and
toes. This is a well-known areal feature (Laycock 1975). The Tayap system allowed
counting up to twenty, although in principle the system could count indefinitely,
because after reaching twenty, one could, I was told, begin counting again on the
body of another person (so ‘twenty-one’ could be ‘two hands and two legs and
one hand one finger on the other side’).
     This laborious system, for which there seems to have been no shorthand, dis-
appeared rapidly after villagers began speaking Tok Pisin among themselves in
the 1930s and 1940s. Today it is only vaguely remembered, and is regarded as an
amusing, cumbersome and primitive curiosity by everyone in Gapun.
     Villagers still use the Tayap words for ‘one’ through to ‘five’, and they some-
times combine them to denote a number between five and ten. For example, I
once overheard a villager ask another in Tayap how many bags a cocoa buyer who
had come to Gapun had filled (this was a typical instance of using Tayap to “hide
talk” from non-villagers). The addressee, a thirty-year-old man who is a very weak
speaker of Tayap and who under other circumstances never speaks it, responded
by saying manaw towotowo (literally ‘three four’), which in this context meant
seven bags.
     Villagers also sometimes use the Tayap word for ‘ten’, but never any of the
others, which are always said in Tok Pisin.
     The traditional system, as I recorded it from senior men in the 1980s, is as
follows:    nambar                              ‘one’
    sene                                ‘two’
    manaw                               ‘three’

     ndaram senea ndow nambar taw         ‘two hands and one leg two toes on the

     ndaram senea ndow sene               ‘two hands and two legs’ (i.e. twenty)
When numbers occur together with other adjectives, they always occur last (other
modifiers can occur in any order; see Section 4.1.1). So:3(3-75) naŋaw moprɨ sene
       naŋaw         moprɨ sene
       woman.dl little.pl two
       ‘two little women’There are no ordinal numerals in Tayap, and to express what English expresses as
adverbial numerals (‘twice’, ‘thrice’, ‘four times’, etc.), Tayap uses a construction in3 senea is sene (‘two’) with the conjunction -a; so ‘two-and’
                                                                  Quantifiers       89
which the number is the main verb and the event that happens a number of times is
nominalized by suffixing the irrealis verb stem with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)gar (see
Section 4.2). This nominalized event serves as the subject of the number-as-verb.

forms are the closed class of nouns denoting some humans, and pigs and dogs. All
other nouns have only one form. To indicate plurality in those nouns, the following
quantifiers may be used. They immediately follow the noun to which they refer:
    samb     general marker of plurality, most often used with countable
             nouns
    non samb used with unquantifiable masses like water or food
    sami     ‘many’, ‘lots of’, ‘plenty’
    -ŋgro    used to signify associative plurality on people or place names,
             pronouns and interrogative words

there is a handful of adjectives that have separate dual and/or plural forms. Further,
Tayap has a marker that attached to adjectives to signify ‘more than one’. This plural
marker (anem) is moribund; these days it is heard in the speech only of speakers over
sixty. From one of those speakers, I elicited sentences such as the following:(3-78) a. numbwan eŋgon anem munjenum
          numbwan eŋgon anem            munjenum
          thought    good poss.pl man.pl
          ‘men with good thoughts’ (lit. ‘good thoughts men’)        b. rew suman anem munjenum
           rew suman anem             munjenum
           fear big        poss.pl man.pl
           ‘cowards’ (lit. ‘big fears men’)In naturally occurring speech of older speakers, this marker of plurality was used
most productively in the context of abuse. Indeed, I was first alerted to it when
transcribing the many “kros-es” (loud public arguments, almost always started
and sustained by women) that occurred in the village (Kulick 1993). There, anem
(shortened to nem after the vowel in the preceding word) occurs in abusive
phrases like the following:(3-79) a. iminkato sawirŋa nem!
          iminkato          sawir =ŋa nem
          lower_intestine black =poss adj.pl
          ‘black assholes!’        b. man sumanŋa nem!
           man suman =ŋa      nem
           cunt big     =poss adj.pl
           ‘big cunts!’The retraction of what may have been a much more widely used marker of plural-
ity to the context of vituperative abuse is an instructive instance of how particular
registers of language (such as abuse) can be repositories of older, obsolescent
forms that for various reasons have all but died out in the language otherwise.
92       3 Word classes3.7 ArticlesTayap has no definite article. The definiteness of a referent emerges either through
the context or because it occurs together with a deictic word.
     The language does, however, have a word, non, which means ‘a’ or ‘some’ –
in the sense of ‘some man’ or ‘some child’ – and which can function as an indefi-
nite article. The word does not mean ‘one’: to specify a singularity, the quantifier
nambar ‘one’ is used (see Section 3.6.1). The word non can occur independently,
as in the following request, which is heard ubiquitously in Gapun, uttered by
someone asking someone else for betel nut:(3-80) non kukukwe
       non     ku     -ku            -we
       indef bring -3sg.f.r.o        -come.sbj
       ‘give me one/some’ (lit. ‘bring me one/some’)When non occurs after a noun, it imparts indefiniteness. If non does not occur,
the referent will likely be interpreted as definite. An example is a sentence like

       child = erg.m cassowary see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.sThis sentence would likely be interpreted to mean ‘the child saw the cassowary’,
but it can mean both ‘the child saw the cassowary’ and ‘the child saw a casso-
wary’. The context of the utterance would usually make it clear if a definite or
indefinite noun were meant.
    If a speaker wanted to emphasize indefiniteness, he or she could use non or
non samb (Section 3.6.2) after the nominal it modifies:(3-82) a. rorŋi ŋgat non tanŋgɨn

‘this’ or ‘that’ and ‘here’ or ‘there’. The language has a word ai for ‘here, and anɨnɨ
for ‘there’. These words are used in simple commands to put something or bring
something ‘here’ or ‘there’:(3-83) a. ainnɨ wo ŋgritukun
          ai      =nɨ    wo    ŋgri -tu -ku       -n

            there on_top put.irr -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
            ‘put it there on top’
              Note: the locative clitic =nɨ on anɨnɨ is optional and frequently omitted (as it is in
              this example) probably because the word ends with nɨ, which is homophonous
              with the locative clitic.","[107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113]"

6.1.3 Class 1 and 2 verbs in young people’s TayapAll verbs that have different stems in their irrealis and realis forms pose problems
for young speakers of Tayap. What generally happens whenever young speakers
are unsure of a form is that they take the irrealis stem (which is the same as the
verb root) and inflect that stem with realis morphology – that is, with object and
subject morphemes marked for realis status.
174          6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbs      So a class 2 verb like war ‘fill’ will be inflected as(6-15) a. *war        -ku                -n
          fill.irr -3sg.f.r.o            -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘I filled it’instead of the correct form, which is:        b.   par -ku                 -n
             fill.r -3sg.f.r.o       -sg|1pl.r.s
             ‘I filled it’An incorrect form like *warkun indicates that the speaker is using the verb root,
war, as the basis for inflection. All young people do this, and this kind of error
demonstrates a central feature of how young speakers produce Tayap verb mor-
phology: they clearly perceive the morphological structure of verbs but they are
unable to produce them correctly.
     The speaker who produced *warkun possibly had a sense that the verb she
wanted is associated with both the semivowel w and the plosive p. Having heard
parkun (‘I filled it’), warkrutak (‘she will fill it’, or ‘you (f) will fill it’) and warkru
wákare (‘X won’t fill it) all her life, the speaker who produced this utterance
probably intuitively knew the different forms that this verb can take. She has not
analyzed the different sounds as signifying different tenses and statuses, and so
what she ends up producing is a verb that mixes together realis and irrealis forms
and results in an ungrammatical neologism.
     Young speakers who attempt to inflect class 1 or 2 verbs that they do not auto-
matically know do one of three things:
     The first thing they can do is illustrated by the above example: they include
both the irrealis and realis forms in the same verb. Other examples are *wurpukun
(instead of puwkun; from wuw ‘carry on shoulder’) and *woipokun (instead of
poikun; from woi ‘roll’).
     The second strategy is to conjugate the class 1 or 2 verb as though it were a
class 5 verb. This means treating the verb root as though it is invariant, and also
using a discontinuous subject marker in the non-future. So a class 1 verb like
kotar-(p)-e ‘ask’ becomes *kotar and is inflected as:(6-16) a. *kotar -tu -ku         -n
          ask.irr -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
          ‘she asked her’
                                                        Transitive verb classes     175
instead of the correct form:        b. kotarpe -ku               -n
           ask.r    -3sg.f.r.o       -sg|1pl.r.s
           ‘she asked her’The ungrammatical verb *kotar-tu-ku-n is a perfectly correctly formed class 5 verb
(see below, Section 6.1.7). The problem is that the verb in question, kotar-(p)-e-, is
a class 1 verb, not a class 5 verb.
     At the same time, however, it is important to note that anyone hearing the
ungrammatical verb *kotar-tu-ku-n will have no trouble understanding its
meaning. The verb root kotar means ‘query’. It derives the noun ‘question’ (as
kotarŋgar) and the intransitive verb ‘ask’, kotarkɨ. Because this basic meaning of
the verb root is known to everyone, it does not make a great deal of difference for
comprehension if the verb is conjugated as a class 1 verb or as a class 5 verb.
     This kind of separable relationship between the meaning of a verb root and the
details of its inflection will likely lead to the attrition of class 1 and 2 verbs. When
it doesn’t matter is if a verb is inflected as mbuspiŋgɨn (class 1, mbus-(p)-i ‘send’)
or mbustiŋgɨn (‘send’ inflected as a class 5 verb), the less regular inflection will
inexorably decline in use in the speech of young speakers who have not learned it.
     At the same time as young speakers simplify Tayap verbal morphology in this
way – that is, treating verbs of other classes as though they were all class 5 verbs –
there is also a competing tendency to insert a p in verbs that do not take one. So
some young speakers produce forms like the following:(6-17) a. *moserpi -ku                 -n
          buy.r       -3sg.f.r.o       -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘I bought it’instead of        b. mose -nu -ku              -n
           buy.r -s      <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg.m|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
           ‘I bought it’
           verb root moser (class 4)(6-18) a. *andpi     -ku       -n
          follow.r <3sg.f.r.o> - sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘I followed her’instead of
176        6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbs        b. kandu       -ku           -n
           follow.r <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|2sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
           ‘I followed her’
           verb root andu- (class 3)Both (6-17a and 6-18a) are inflected as class 1 verbs in the non-future tense,
despite the fact that moser ‘buy’ is a class 4 verb and andu ‘follow’ is a class 3
verb. These cases exhibit the opposite of the tendency just discussed: instead of
collapsing class 1 and 2 verbs into class 5 verbs, verbs from other classes become
incorporated into class 1 and 2 verbs.
     There may have always been some free variation in Tayap on this count. In
the speech of the oldest Tayap speakers, for example, I recorded two words for
the verb ‘sweep’; one mburai (class 5) and the other mburai-(p)-i (class 1). The
difference in non-future inflection between these two verbs is the element that
directly follows the stem: in the first verb that is n or t plus a vowel, in the second
verb it is a p.
     So using the first verb, one would say that a woman mburaitukun her house;
using the second, one would say she mburaipikun.
     When I asked if these two forms meant anything different the oldest speakers in
the village told me no, they were exact synonyms. And that they were both correct.
     The co-existence of two different forms of the same verb suggests that there may
have always been some accepted variation in the classification of verbs as class 5 or
class 1 verbs. If this is the case, then it seems that some young speakers have honed
in on that variation and exploited it. They inflect verbs as class 1 verbs (i.e. inserting
a p in the non-future) much less frequently than they simply collapse all verbs into
class 5 verbs. But the fact that they can create class 1 verbs out of verb roots from
other classes shows, once again, that young speakers possess a broad repertoire of
grammatical competence in Tayap. What they lack is productive ability.
     The third strategy that young speakers use when they are unsure of how to
conjugate a class 1 or 2 verb in the non-future is to inflect it in the progressive
aspect. This often makes little semantic sense. But as is discussed in Section
8.3.1, the progressive aspect is an “easy” inflectional form – all one needs to know
is three things: (1) the irrealis stem form of the verb; (2) the benefactive object
(which in most cases will be -kwan ‘3sg.f.ben.r.o’); and (3) the correct form of the
verb ‘be’. This relative morphological transparency appeals to younger speakers
and allows them to use verbs they otherwise would have a hard time inflecting.
     Thus, rather than tackling the class 2 verb war ‘grate’, to generate the correct
non-future form parkun ‘I grated it’, or the class 1 verb o ‘shoot’, to generate the
correct non-future form pokun ‘I shot it’, young speakers telling stories about
their actions and adventures say things like the following:
                                                      Transitive verb classes     177
(6-19) a. war          -kwan       -kuk
          grate.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o -be.1sg.f.r.s
          ‘I (f) was grating it’        b. o           -kwan         -kut
           strike.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o - be.sg.m.r.s
           ‘I (m) was shooting it’These are perfectly formed progressives. However, the context in which they
occurred demanded the non-future tense. But by inflecting the verbs in the pro-
gressive aspect, the speakers who needed them were at least able to use them.
This phenomenon illustrates a general rule of grammatical decay in Tayap,
namely: the weaker the speaker, the more instances of the progressive aspect that
speaker will use (see also Section 8.3.1).","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197]"
"1.2 Past research on TayapThe history of linguistic research on Tayap is very brief. In 1937, Gapun was visited
by one of the few white men ever to make it there. This was Georg Höltker, a
German S.V.D. (Societas Verbi Divini) missionary and anthropologist. Höltker
went to Gapun in the company of another missionary based in the coastal village
of Watam, and he spent three hours in the village. He took two photographs and
collected a word list.
     A year later, Höltker published the list of 125 words, together with the weary
remark that “it will be awhile before any other researcher ‘stumbles across’
Gapun, if only because of the small chances of worthwhile academic yields in
this tiny village community, and also because of the inconvenient and arduous
route leading to this linguistic island” (1938: 280). (A translation of Höltker’s
short article is included here in Appendix 1, along with the two photographs he
took in Appendix 2).
     Höltker’s brief squib remained all that was known about Tayap until the early
1970s, when the Australian linguist Don Laycock travelled around the lower Sepik
to collect basic vocabulary lists that allowed him to identify and propose classi-
fications of the many languages spoken there. Laycock never visited Gapun, but
he did get as far as neighboring Wongan, and he interviewed two Gapun villag-
ers who were staying there at the time, Kawi Waiki and Konjab Akumbi (Laycock
1973: 35).
     On the basis of the word list and a few verb paradigms that he gathered
from Kawi and Konjab, Laycock classified Tayap (which he called “Gapun”) as a
sub-phylum of the Sepik-Ramu language phylum. In the classification terminol-
ogy used by Laycock and his linguistic colleagues in the 1970s, this meant that
Tayap shared less than twelve percent of its basic vocabulary with other members
of the phylum, and also that it exhibited marked differences from other members
of the phylum – in Tayap’s case, gender pronouns and other differences related
                                                            Past research on Tayap        9
to gender marking were mentioned. (The word list used by Laycock appears as an
appendix to his 1973 article. A discussion of the classifying criteria used to sort
out Papuan languages is in Wurm 1982: 65–72.)
     Laycock included one other language in what he called the “Gapun
sub-phylum level family”. This was a language of over two thousand speak-
ers, called Bungain. Bungain is geographically distant from Gapun (off to the
north and west of Map 1.2, see page 13), and Gapuners have no social, cultural
or economic ties or affinities with – or even knowledge of – Bungain speakers.
The relationship that Laycock postulated between Tayap and Bungain was not
based on any solid data or analysis – it was based on the basic vocabulary list
he used, as well as some rudimentary grammatical information, such as trans-
lations of ‘Give me tobacco’, ‘I cannot give you any, I have none’, ‘If I had some I
would give it to you’. Laycock himself noted that all his classifications of Sepik
languages were “tentative” and “impressionistic” (1973: 2). His description of
the supposed similarities between Bungain and Tayap, in its entirety, consists
of the following:    The languages show complex verb morphology, after the manner of Nor-Pondo languages
    (subject marking by prefix in Bungain, and suffix in Gapun); but there is apparently no
    noun classification, and no indication of number in nouns. Gapun has a third-feminine
    pronoun; Bungain appears to lack this, but there is apparent gender concordance
    in verbs.
                                                                          (Laycock 1973: 35)
Aside from the remark about complex verb morphology – which is a feature
shared by many Papuan languages – this description makes Bungain and Tayap
sound more dissimilar than similar (it also turns out that Tayap, in fact, does mark
number on a restricted class of nouns; see Section 3.1.3). In an attempt to assess
the feasibility of Laycock’s classification of Tayap and Bungain, I looked through
the field data on which he based the classification, namely his field notebooks D7,
D26 and D27, which are deposited in the Linguistics Department at the Australian
National University, where Laycock worked.2
     Unfortunately, the notebooks turned out to be of quite limited use, because
Laycock often did not translate the vernacular words he noted down in his field
notebooks. He numbered the words, but his numbering does not correspond to
2 I am grateful to the collective efforts of Melissa Crowther, Mark Donohue, Nicholas Evans,
Ewan Maidment, Doug Marmion, Malcom Ross and Nick Thieberger in helping me track down
and obtain scanned copies of these notebooks.
10       1 The Tayap language and its speakersthe list he provides in his published article on how he classified them (Laycock
1973: 70–71).
     For example, in his Bungain fieldnotes, a word Laycock does translate, as
‘snake’ (atop’), is numbered 172. But in the published list, ‘snake’ is word number
152. Eight untranslated words follow atop’, but the ninth, kwulémbe, Laycock
translates as ‘mosquito’. The problem is that in the word list published in his
article, ‘mosquito’ comes eleven words after ‘snake’. These kinds of discrepancies
make it impossible to use the word list Laycock provided in his article to identify
the untranslated vernacular words he noted down in his field notebooks. This is
not a problem with Laycock’s Tayap material, because I know the meaning of all
the words he noted down. But since I know no Bungain, much of his list for that
language is unrevealing.
     As far as I am able to tell, there are no lexical similarities between Bungain
and Tayap, beyond a couple of words that are common throughout the Sepik,
such as the word for water (Bungain: wi; Tayap awin). Grammatically and mor-
phologically, I could discern no similarities between Tayap and Bungain, and
after examining the fieldnotes I was at a loss to understand the basis for his state-
ment that “their relationship with each other is clear but not close” (Laycock and
Z’graggen 1975: 757).
     My own suspicion is that Laycock couldn’t easily fit either Tayap or Bungain
into the language families he had developed for the Sepik region, and so he
simply guessed that they might be related to one another. Later researchers
have suggested that Bungain may be a Torricelli phylum language (Sanders and
Sanders 1980: 188). Foley (2018) classes Bungain as a member of the Marienberg
Hills family, a subgroup of the Torricelli family. He bases the classification of
Bungain on morphological criteria gleaned from his own fieldwork data, which
he describes as “brief” (Foley 2018: 304). He provides some of this data, includ-
ing a pronoun paradigm, subject agreement prefixes, morphological description
and some sentence material in his major descriptive work on the Sepik-Ramu
languages (2018: 197–431). None of this material is suggestive of a relationship
between Bungain and Tayap.
     To illustrate how different Tayap is from neighboring languages, I have
added it to the “Lower Sepik family basic word list” that appears in William
Foley’s 1986 book, The Papuan languages of New Guinea. To enable the table to
appear on a single page, I have omitted one of the languages in the original table
(Karawari). The (K) after words in the Murik column indicates forms in the Kopar
language.

guages listed in this table, such as the words for ‘village’, ‘water’, ‘lime’ (that
is, the white powder made of bivalve shells that villagers pulverize and chew
together with betel nut) and ‘eat’. The Tayap verb meaning ‘go’ is realized as wak-
in the habitual progressive aspect and the counterfactual mood (see Sections 8.3
and 9.4.3), thus probably making it cognate with Yimas, Chambri and Murik. The
Tayap word for ‘woman’ is cognate with Angoram’s ‘female’, and the words for
‘fire’, ‘pig’, ‘one’, ‘egg’, perhaps ‘three’ and a few others are similar to some of the
words in one or more of the other languages.
     A few words, such as those for ‘canoe’ and ‘oar’ are borrowings – Gapuners only
learned to paddle canoes after WWII, when they moved their village from its former
site up on a mountain down closer to the mangrove lagoon. They did this so that it
would be easier for them to transport the cash crops they heard they should grow
– at the time, those were rice and peanuts – out of the village and to waiting buyers
(who for the most part never materialized). All words related to canoes, paddles and
fishing in the mangrove lagoon are borrowings from the Kopar language.
     But despite the cognates that do exist – something that one would expect
given that people in the lower Sepik have had various forms of contact with one
another for a very long time – it is striking that Tayap is so different from other
Lower Sepik languages. Of the fifty words listed, at least thirty five of them, or
seventy percent, are unique.

"9.8.1 Cosubordinate constructions with modifying suffix -ra (mod)Consider the -ra6 construction first, in comparison with two independent clauses
linked by a conjunction:
    Coordinated construction:(9-36) a. ŋɨ pɨŋneta katot
          ŋɨ      pɨŋ      -net     -a katot
          3sg.m jump.r -sg.m.r.s -and go_down.sg.m.r

            3sg.m jump.r -mod go_down.sg.m.r
            ‘he jumped down’     Coordinated construction:
6 Two verb roots realize -ra as -wa. Those roots are ke-(p/w)-ekɨ ‘fall out’ (realized in the mod
form as ke-wa) and adɨokɨ ‘trip’ (realized as adɨ-wa).
276          9 Simple and complex sentences(9-37) a. ŋgu mamrartaka wok
          ŋgu    mamrar -tak               -a wok

          ‘she shook and went/as she went’      Cosubordinate construction:         b. ŋgu mamrara wok
            ŋgu     mamrar -ra wok
            3sg.f shake.r -mod go.3sg.f.r
            ‘she shivered’The difference in meaning between these two forms is subtle. Speakers say that
the fully inflected forms – those in (9-36a) and (9-37a) above – are synonymous
with the -ra forms – those in (9-36b) and (9-37b). Some verbs – ‘jump’ for example –
regularly occur in both forms. At the same time, however, it is clear that the
morpheme -ra does not just link two verbs in a temporal sequence like the con-
junction –(y)a does (Section 9.3.1). Instead, -ra modifies both the verb to which it
affixes and the verb of motion that follows it, creating a new lexical predicate out
of two independent verbs.
     In an important sense, all complex predicates create new lexical verbs by
linking together a series of different verbs. But the difference in this case is this:
other kinds of sequences in Tayap create complex predicates by conjoining verbs
that retain their separate lexical meaning even as they link together in sequences
with other verbs. Their meaning is additive – each verb contributes its particular
meaning to the final compound construction. So a sequence like tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨ-
takana (Section 8.1ff) that was discussed in the previous chapter is composed of sep-
arate constituents that each add their own meaning to the action being expressed,
resulting in a verb that means ‘she will carry him down on her shoulders’.
     Complex clauses created with the -ra suffix, on the other hand, are not addi-
tive, they are transformative. A complex clause created with -ra is not so much the
sum of its parts as it is a new semantic entity. Although many verbs formed with -ra
do retain a transparent relation to the independent verbs that derive them, others
have meanings that are completely different from the two verbs that compose
them. So ‘faint’, for example, is wasowra aiki- (wasow ‘die’ + -ra + aiki ‘come’).7
     Another way in which the -ra suffix transforms verbs is that it reduces their
valency. Compare the verb worer ‘capsize’ in constructions formed with -ra, and
7 This suffix occurs on at least one noun: the way to express that a body part has ‘fallen asleep’,
as one says in English, is to use the derived verb sɨwɨdɨdɨmra okɨ, which comes from the word for
small black ants; so sɨwɨdɨdɨm ‘ants’ + -ra + okɨ ‘go’.

in serial verb constructions formed with a non-final verb + a final verb like those
discussed in Section 8.2:(9-38) a. ewar yimbar worerara wok
          ewar        yimbar worer          -ara wok

          yesterday 3pl canoe capsize.irr -3sg.f.r.o- go.3sg.f.r
          ‘yesterday they tipped over the canoe’(9-39) a. awin worerara wok
          awin worer          -ara wok
          water capsize.irr -mod go.3sg.f.r

          ŋa =yi       awin worer    -ku                     wok
          1sg =erg water capsize.irr -3sg.f.r.o              go.3sg.f.r
          ‘I poured the water’Notice how the first sentences in these pairs (9-38a) and (9-39a) only has one argu-
ment – the subject, ‘canoe’ in (9-38a) and ‘water’ in (9-39a). The second sentences
have two arguments – subject (‘they’ and ‘I’) and object (‘canoe’ and ‘water’).
     Negation on verbs marked with -ra is only marked on the independent verb
that carries TAM, but its scope is both/all verb stems. So the negation of a verb
like ‘jump’ is:(9-40) ŋɨ       pɨŋ      -ra     atɨ           -kɨ   wákare
       3sg.m jump.r -mod go_down.irr -irr neg
       ‘he didn’t jump down’ or ‘he won’t jump down’9.8.2 Cosubordinate constructions with manner suffix -kar (mann)Like clause chains constructed with -ra, those formed with -kar also add a mor-
pheme directly onto the irrealis stem of a verb that precedes a verb of motion, thus
creating a medial verb. Unlike the -ra forms, however, constructions formed with
-kar or its allophonic variant -kwar (the environment triggering the alternation
278         9 Simple and complex sentencesis unknown) maintain the separate meanings of the modified verb and the verb
of motion that follows it. The suffix -kar creates a manner medial verb, one that
answers the question ‘How or in what manner did X go/come, etc.?’
    Verbs constructed with -kar are constructed in the following way:      irr verb stem + -kar/-kwar + fully inflected verb of motionVerbs formed with -kar encode the simultaneity of both actions for the duration
of both actions. In English, this temporal relationship would be rendered with the
adverbial ‘as’, as in ‘They were laughing as they washed the dishes’, or participle
clauses, as in ‘Laughing, they washed the dishes’. In other words, the first action,
laughing, occurred simultaneously with, and continued for the same length of
time as, the second action, washing the dishes.
    This foregrounding of duration and simultaneity results in awkward literal
translations, as in the following example:(9-41) nda mbɨd non         rekɨ ai        -kar wek
       dm pain indef with come.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
       ‘she came feeling pain as she came’A more idiomatic translation would be with an English adverbial phrase; some-
thing that highlighted the experience of pain as during travel, like ‘In pain, she
made her way here’.
    Cosubordinate constructions created with the -kar suffix also highlight an
action or process that has begun and is continuing, especially when the con-
struction is used with an inanimate subject. In English, this kind of phrase
would use a verb of inception, like ‘begin’ or ‘start’, or a verb of intensifi-
cation or process, like ‘growing’ or ‘becoming’; for example: ‘his anger was
growing’.
    The verb of motion that follows the medial verb created with the -kar suffix is
most commonly either ‘go’ (okɨ) or ‘come’ (aiki), although any verb of motion may
occur in this slot. Examples are:(9-42) a. ŋgu    warak     -kar wek
          3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
          ‘she came talking’         b. ŋɨ       ŋgar          -kwar mbot
            3sg.m call_out.irr -mann go.sg.m.r
            ‘he called out as he went along’
                                                Cosubordinate constructions      279
The sense of development and process means that these verb forms can co-occur
with other chained forms, such as the -ra forms, for example:(9-43) minjike =ŋa        mbatep pwak         -ra    o       -kar     wek
       betel_nut =poss unit        drop.irr -mod go.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
       ‘the flowers on the betel nut (palm) are in the process of opening’This suggests that the -ra clause and the -kar clause are syntactically equivalent,
both equally dependent on the final verb wek ‘come’.
    The directionality of the verb of motion (‘go’ or ‘come’) can express a differ-
ence in meaning, as in the following:(9-44) a. toto andɨ           -kar      wek
          skin swell.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
          ‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (in various places because bees have stung me)        b.    toto andɨ          -kar      wok
             skin swell.irr -mann go.3sg.f.r
             ‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (from a central point and spreading outwards)This kind of semantic difference encoded by different verbs of motion may have
been more productive in the past, and subtle nuances may have been eroded and
lost over the course of the last few decades. Today, senior speakers insist that with
only a few exceptions, such as (9-44a) and (9-44b) above, verbs formed with ‘go’
and ‘come’ have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably.
     Chains with -kar are negated by placing the negative marker after the inde-
pendent verb. So the negated form of example (9-42a) is:(9-45) ŋgu    warak      -kar    ai      -ki wákare
       3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.irr -irr neg
       ‘she was not talking as she came’The scope of negation in manner constructions has to include the medial verb.
Thus, the negated sentence means that the woman probably still came (the sen-
tence probably would not have been uttered if she hadn’t come); she just didn’t
come talking.
     This seems to indicate that -kar (and in fact -ra) are complex verbal con-
structions rather than adverbials, since negation of adverbials would be
expressed with the negator directly after the adverbial, not as here at the end
of the clause.
280        9 Simple and complex sentences9.9 Tail-head linkageTayap makes extensive use of tail-head linkage, a phenomenon in which the
last verb of one sentence is repeated as the first verb of the next sentence. It is a
coherence device for structuring discourse and is very common among Papuan
languages (de Vries 2005). In de Vries’s terms, Tayap’s tail-head linkage is the
chained type, utilizing the basic complex clause structures of the language,
namely coordination and subordination.
     Some examples, which are taken from the Tayap Texts at the end of this
grammar, are presented below (see those texts for many more examples of this
phenomenon).
     The following excerpt is a continuous stretch of speech taken from a narrated

           ‘It died and there…’In most cases of tail-head linkage, only the verb is repeated. The second instance
of the verb usually occurs with a conjunction marker to connect it to the clause
that follows. However, other material can be repeated too: an example is the
oblique NP repeated with the verb in lines (9-47 a-b).
282          9 Simple and complex sentences9.10 Complex constructions with the suffix signifying
     multiplicity -rar (ml)The final suffix occurring on complex sentences is -rar. This suffix signifies
that the action denoted by the verb occurred in relation to multiple objects – so
‘look at many things’ instead of just ‘look’, or ‘shoot at many things’ instead of
just ‘shoot’. The suffix -rar is always used on transitive verbs. The object mor-
pheme is always in the realis form. TAM is marked on the final, independent
verb of motion that follows the medial verb. Even though the action of the verb
happens multiple times, the object is still singular. So the structure of this form
is as follows:      transitive verb stem irr + object r + -rar + verb of motion inflected for

Verbs constructed with -rar are negated by negating the final, fully inflected verb
in the series. And like -kar verbs, the scope of negation covers the whole construc-
tion. So the negated form of (9-49a), above, is:(9-50) tar        -ku          -rar ai-ki       wákare
       take.irr -3sg.f.r.o     -ml come.irr-irr neg
       ‘he didn’t come collecting several’9.11 Complex sentences in young people’s TayapYoung people use a great deal of tail-head linkage in their narratives. The narra-
tor of Text 4, for example – a twenty-year-old man with good passive Tayap but
limited active command of the language – uses tail-head linkage in fifty percent of
his clause conjunctions. Compare this with between roughly ten to twelve percent
in Texts 1–3, which were narrated by more fluent speakers.
     Subordinate and cosubordinate clauses are beyond the capability of most
Tayap speakers younger than thirty. A few of the most skilled passive active speak-
ers (such as the twenty-five-year-old narrator of Tayap Text 3) can use the subordi-
nating morpheme -re to produce ‘when’ clauses (see lines 26 and 51 in Tayap Text 3).
But hypothetical morphemes – like the counterfactual mood that often accompa-
nies it – are mostly dead, and in fifty five of the fifty six narratives by young people
that I collected in Gapun, there is not a single instance of relativization.8
     Young people’s narratives are strings of events presented paratactically –
X did Y, Z happened, Q did P. Sometimes, the events are narrated with no
clause-linking morphology, as in the following extract, from a narrative told
by a twenty-three-year-old man (hesitations, false starts and interruptions and
encouragements by another speaker have been edited out of this extract):8 The single exception is a complex narrative in flawless Tayap told by a twenty-nine-year-old
young woman named Mbonika Amburi (the same Mbonika who features as a six-year-old girl
in the opening vignette of Kulick 1992). Mbonika is the paradigm example of the passive active
speaker. She never speaks more than a few formulaic phrases of Tayap to anyone, and knowing
her well and seeing her every day, I had come to assume that her command of the vernacular was
minimal. After being astonished by the fluency of her Tayap narrative, I asked her why she never
spoke the language. She is ashamed, she told me. She feared that if she spoke Tayap and said
something wrong, the old people in the village would laugh at her. “They’ll criticize”, she told
me. “They’ll say, ‘You all speak Tok Pisin too much and so you don’t know the vernacular’. For
that reason, I’m ashamed to speak the vernacular” (“Ol bai wokim koments, ‘Tok Pisin i planti na
yupela i no save long tok ples’. Na olsem na mi save sem long tok ples.”)

which are typical of the kinds of errors made by young speakers), note that he
does not use a single coordinating, cosubordinating or subordinating morpheme
throughout this entire stretch of speech. The verb phrases that make up the nar-
rative are simply placed one after the other with no linkage between them. (The
final a of the nonce word taina could be a coordinating morpheme, but this is
hard to know since the word doesn’t mean anything.)
     Much more commonly than simply listing verb phrases one after the other,
young speakers link clauses with the coordinating conjunction -(y)a. Here is an
extract from a narrative about a pig hunt by a twenty-six-year-old man who is one
of the more advanced younger speakers in the village:(9-52)   … Ŋa motɨnɨ warukpeta mbet. Mbeta mborma ndow tankuna anpekuna

9 The correct form is either tanin ‘he saw me’ or tanŋgɨn ‘I saw him’.
10 The speaker wants a non-future verb here – nitukun ‘she made’. But even the progressive verb
he uses is incorrectly inflected. The form he wants is nirkwanuk ‘she was making’.

        shit, blood. And [Tok Pisin] I called out…’This speaker has the typical problem with the class 3 transitive verb andu ‘follow’
(see Section 6.1.5). The form he wants is kandukun, not the nonce form he creates
by using the verb root as the basis for the non-future inflection. But regardless of
his difficulty inflecting some verbs, he nevertheless is able to link verb phrases
into a coherent narrative. He does this with a single morphological tool, however:
the coordinating conjunction -(y)a.
     This morpheme has been over-extended in the speech of most young speak-
ers to do the work of all coordinating, cosubordinating and subordinating mor-
phemes. The reason for this over-extension is probably twofold.
     First, -a occurs frequently in Tayap, as a way to link coordinated clauses (see
Section 9.3.1).
     Second, the suffix -a, especially when it appears in speech after verbs ending
in n – verbs like tankun and *andpekun in the narrative above – sounds a lot like
(and behaves syntactically a lot like) Tok Pisin’s conjunction “na”, which means
‘and’. That Tok Pisin is never far from the minds of young Tayap speakers is
evident at the end of the above narrative, when the speaker briefly code-switches
into Tok Pisin, precisely to link two clauses.
     Cosubordinate verbs formed with the multiple suffix, -rar, do not appear in
the narratives I collected from speakers younger than thirty, and verbs formed
with the modifying -ra suffix only occur when they have become lexicalized, in
verbs like worer-ara wok ‘pour’ or wasow-ra wek ‘faint’.
286        9 Simple and complex sentences     The only kind of cosubordinate construction that young speakers do some-
times use is verbs formed with the medial manner suffix -kar. A small number of
verbs recur in the different narratives. These verbs always encode motion, never
process or development, and they are verbs that have probably been lexicalized,
like rar-kar mbot (‘I looked and came’), mar-kar ŋgwok (‘they rowed away’), and
amai-kwar wek (‘I was searching as I came’).
     However, the -kar form remains productive for at least some speakers, who
produced verbs like the following:(9-53) a. mɨri    adu         -kwar *weske
          forest break.irr -mann come_outside.dl
          ‘the two of us came crashing out of the forest’; *weske has no meaning;
          the speaker wants uske, from the verb root aski-.       b. naw           apu          -kwar ŋgwek
          grassland burn.irr -mann come.3pl.r
          ‘they burned and came’; a morphologically correctly formed but
          semantically incorrect verb – the speaker was talking about men
          lighting fire to a grassland to drive game out towards men waiting
          with spears, and she wants otar war-kwar ŋgwek: ‘fire light.irr-mann
          come’; lit. ‘they lit fire while coming’.       c. ŋgat        sene am           -kwar ŋgwek
          cassowary two fight.irr -mann come.3pl.r
          ‘the two cassowaries were fighting with one another as they came’;
          the speaker wants the dual form of ‘come’, weke.","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306]"

5 Basic verb morphology5.1 General properties of Tayap verbsIn Tayap a single complex predicate can express the equivalent of an entire
sentence in English. This is most apparent in its serial verb constructions,
which can express a complex action like ‘she intends to carry him down on
her shoulders’ in a single predicate (tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana). Serial verb con-
structions like this are discussed in Chapter 8. For basic sentence structure, see
Section 9.1.
    Transitivity, TAM (tense, aspect and mood) and realis/irrealis status are mor-
phologically encoded in verbs by suffixes, with the object suffix preceding the
subject suffix.
    In transitive verbs, this occurs in the following manner:(5-1) a. poŋgro
         po                         -ŋg                           -ro
         verb stem ‘strike’         -object/undergoer ‘him’       -subject/actor ‘they’
         in realis                  in realis                     in realis          ‘they hit him’       b. oŋgrɨndak
          o                         -ŋgrɨ                         -ndak
          verb stem ‘strike’        -object/undergoer ‘him’       -subject/actor ‘they’
          in irrealis               in irrealis                   in irrealis           ‘they will hit him’Intransitive verbs, too, signal both subject and status, but many of them tend to
do so in a more fusional manner than is the case for transitive verbs, especially in
the non-future tense (which expresses events or actions that are occurring in the
present or that have occurred in the past).
    An example of intransitive verbs is the verb poror ‘sing’. Some of the forms
that this verb takes in the non-future and the future tenses are as follows:(5-2) a. poror-net                          poror-nak                   poror-ŋguk

(except in certain modification constructions, see Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2), and
which also never occur without being marked for status, either realis or irrealis
(although some verbs, e.g. poror above have the same stem for both). The root
forms of these stems – that is, the forms that are available for derivational pro-
cesses like nominalization, and the citation forms that are entered in the diction-
ary as the lexical entry for a verb – are the irrealis forms of the stem.
     A note is in order on the terms “roots” and “stems” as they are used here.
Roots are the lexical parts of a word, the unanalyzable part left once the
affixes are all taken off. Stems are involved when inflectional affixes apply to
different forms of a root (Aikhenvald 2007: 38–40). So Tayap verb roots have
inflectional stems: that is, for instance, there are separate inflectional stems
for realis and irrealis. In this grammar, “stem” refers to the inflectional possi-
bilities of a verb root, and “root” designates the basic underlying lexical part
of the verb.
     Verbs in Tayap have the following structure:                                    V – O – (A)
                                      V – (S)Note that verbal morphology, unlike clausal relations, follows a nominative-
accusative alignment system.
    Verbs in Tayap mark the following elements:Status
Has the action of the verb happened or is happening? Has it not happened?","[155, 156, 157]"
"
Adjectives follow their head noun. Some examples:(3-36) munje      kemem
       man        long
       ‘tall man’(3-37) noŋor    kɨtɨŋɨn
       woman short
       ‘short woman’(3-38) orak     apro
       thing    bad
       ‘bad thing’(3-39) arawer mɨk
       sun       sharp
       ‘hot sun’ (lit. ‘sharp sun’)Adjectives can function predicatively as well as attributively, although this is less
common than in a language like English, because adjectives, like nouns, can
become verbs (see below, Section 3.3.2). So rather than saying something like “the
sun is hot” – which can be said, as arawer mɨk (lit. ‘sun sharp’), as in (3-39) – speak-
ers of Tayap more readily say arawer mɨknet (lit. ‘sun sharpens’, i.e. ‘sun is hot’).
     Examples of adjectives occurring predicatively are as follows:(3-40) a. munjema nam eŋgon aŋgi
          munje =ma        nam eŋgon aŋgi
          man     =poss talk good dx
          ‘human beings’ talk is good talk’ (said by a man chastising his
          daughter for swearing, making an implicit contrast with the grunts
          and howls of animals)         b. ŋgu sumanke wekŋan?
            ŋgu     suman =ke wek                  =ŋan
            3sg.f big         =q come.3sg.f.r =poss
            ‘did she come all grown up?’ (said, with a rhetorical flourish, about a
            woman who married into Gapun at a young age)
                                                                 Adjectives       69

           ‘mine (i.e. my children) are ignorant’ (said by a father speaking about
           his children’s knowledge of Tayap)Adjectives can rarely function alone as the sole member of an NP; this only occurs
when the head noun is understood:(3-41) sawir aŋgo wuk
       black dx       be.3sg.f.r
       ‘this black (one) is there’3.3.1 Number inflection in adjectivesAdjectives can take a plural suffix, as discussed in Section 3.6.2, but they can also
inflect for number using partial suppletion. Like nouns, which but for a handful
of exceptions do not inflect for number, the overwhelming majority of adjectives
have only one form, and they do not change for number or gender. There are four
exceptions to this.
     Only two adjectives are inflected with partially suppletive forms in the sin-
gular, dual and plural: ‘little’ and ‘old’. The dual and plural forms are used only
for animate referents – so one says rorsem moprɨ (children little-dl, ‘two little
children’), but patɨr mokop sene (house little-sg two, ‘two little houses’).
     The dual and plural forms recorded here are moribund: they were given to me
in the 1980s by senior men who have since died. Today, only the oldest speakers
are able to produce them:(3-42) a. ‘little’                       b. ‘old’
          sg       mokop                    sg    kowot
          dl       moprɨ                    dl    kotiw
          pl       mopro                    pl    kotoIn addition to ‘little’ and ‘old’, two adjectives meaning ‘young’ have singular and
plural forms, but lack a dual form:(3-43) a. ‘young’ (used for both        b. ‘young’ (traditionally used only for
          males and females)               females; nowadays used for both sexes)
          sg eiwɨr                         sg mambɨr
          pl eiwɨro                        pl mambro
70       3 Word classes3.3.2 Verbalized adjectivesLike nouns, all adjectives can be zero-derived as intransitive verbs by directly suf-
fixing them with morphemes that encode realis/irealis status, subject and other
verbal categories. The verbs derived in this way are generally inchoatives; they
express a change of state:(3-44) a. ŋgu kararkɨtak

3.4 AdverbsTayap has many closed classes of adverbs: common, -kɨ, temporal, frequency/
distributional or ‘not yet’, and elevational/positional adverbs. They will each be
described below.","[88, 89, 90, 91, 92]"
"3.1.1.1 Common nouns
Common nouns function as the heads of NPs and take masculine or feminine
gender agreement. Some examples (common nouns in bold):(3-1) aramre menjikan nda wisŋgɨn

      ‘the snake shed its skin’Proper nouns do not form a subclass of nouns in Tayap. Like common nouns,
they can be modified. For example:(3-6) Erapo ŋgwab sawir =ŋan apro sakar
      Erapo hole      black =poss bad intens
      ‘Fucking black-holed Erapo!’3.1.1.2 Locational nouns
Some place names, particularly names of places in the rainforest, function as
bare adjuncts, whereas all other nouns must take a peripheral case clitic, either
locative, ablative or perlative. Some examples of locational nouns are as follows:(3-7) Kandumsik ndow -kru              -nana     ainda mbek
      Kandumsik leg       -3sg.f.irr.o -intent dx         come.1sg.f|2sg.|1pl.r
      ‘I’m coming to Kandumsik [stream] (to put my legs in the water)’      Note: in this example, the noun ‘leg’ is functioning as a transitive verb
      (see also example (3-26).

      ‘One day we went to Murar.’(3-9) Ŋgasimbara ŋgwuk
      Ŋgasimbara be.3pl.r
      ‘They were at Ŋgasimbara’Not all place names can function as bare adjuncts, for example Turuŋgwad in the
following example occurs with a locative clitic (glossed Allative):(3-10) mun      sene rɨpɨm ŋgɨ woke           Turuŋgwad =re
       man.dl two before 3pl go.dl.r Turuŋgwad =all
       ‘Once upon a time, two men, the two of them went to Turuŋgwad’When part of a complex NP, locational nouns can take a location affix. In the fol-
lowing example, Murar stream occurs in a locative-marked NP. The place name
Murar is the head of the NP, modified by ‘stream’ which then takes the locative
clitic to refer to the whole NP:(3-11) naweke ŋgoka Murar nuwombnɨ ŋgomar tarkwanŋgukre sumbwa sindernɨ

       ‘They went across the grassland to Murar stream and when they were

       and came’Nouns functioning as heads of NPs are discussed in Chapter 4. Peripheral cases
are discussed there in Section 4.4.","[69, 70, 71]"
"1.4 Young people’s TayapIn addition to language recorded through formal elicitation sessions and tran-
scriptions of naturally occurring speech, this grammar and dictionary is also
informed by fifty-six narratives from forty five young people aged fourteen to
thirty that I collected and transcribed between July and November 2009.
     I elicited these narratives primarily to see whether villagers younger than
about thirty had any active command of Tayap at all. By mid-2009, after having
lived in Gapun twenty-four hours a day for more than three months, I found
that I was still unable to accurately judge this. The reason I had trouble assess-
ing younger villagers’ active competence in Tayap during this time was because
whenever I asked young people if they “save toktok long tok ples” (spoke Tayap),
they all told me, sure they did.
     The problem was, I never heard any of them doing so. Once in a while I would
hear a young person utter a few formulaic phrases in Tayap, but this was usually
done to mark a situation as funny, and it was usually accompanied and followed
by laughter. It also seemed to me that whenever villagers under twenty-five
mouthed even a short formulaic phrase in Tayap, their tone of voice shifted to
suggest that they were imitating or quoting someone else, usually to mock them
(a big man’s Voice of Authority, for example). Much the same happened whenever
I pressed the young people who told me that they spoke Tayap, and asked them
to tell me exactly what kind of things they said in the vernacular. In response,
they would list a few words like mum and tamwai (sago jelly and sago pancake,
respectively) and a few rudimentary formulaic phrases, such as the command to
hand over some betel nut or tobacco.
     At the same time, however, Tayap does continue to be heard throughout
Gapun. Women and men over fifty use it habitually (even if they continually
code-switch between Tayap and Tok Pisin), and a few men and women in their
mid-thirties and older also use Tayap very frequently, even when speaking to
their children. Even small children in the village understand the commands to
go and fetch things, hit dogs, get out of the way, stop crying, etc. that adults are
continually hollering at them.
18       1 The Tayap language and its speakers     Given that it was clear that Tayap was still used throughout Gapun, for a long
time I thought that perhaps the young people really were quite competent in the
vernacular, as they claimed to be. I fretted that I just never seemed to be in the
right place at the right time to hear them when they actually spoke it.
     I began to wonder whether the reason I wasn’t hearing young people telling
each other stories or asking each other questions in Tayap was because maybe
they spoke it mostly out of the earshot of older, more fluent speakers. Maybe they
felt ashamed that they weren’t speaking it completely flawlessly, I conjectured.
Or perhaps the vernacular, for them, had become tied to particular social events
like same-sex gossip or hanging out in the rainforest – speech situations that
only happened when young people were alone in groups and away from nosy and
critical parents and elders.
     To see whether any of this was in fact the case, I ended up spending a
great deal of time with young people of both sexes between the ages of four-
teen to twenty-five. I accompanied young men into the rainforest on frequent
occasions, to go looking for birds to shoot with arrows or slingshots, and also
when they went off together in groups to perform secret rituals that refresh
their bodies.
     I also spent a lot of time hanging out with young women. One place I made
a point of doing this was inside maternity huts. Maternity huts are small, flimsy,
hurriedly-constructed little houses on stilts, set on the periphery of the village,
often near areas that villagers go off into to urinate or defecate. Women ready to
give birth walk to special places in the rainforest, have their baby, then return
to these maternity huts, where they are supposed to stay for up to three months
(even though most young women these days find excuses to go back into their
usual houses after only a few perfunctory weeks). During the entire period a
woman is in a maternity hut, no man is supposed to visit her or even set eyes
upon her and her newborn baby because villagers believe that the quantities of
blood and uterine fluids discharged during childbirth make a woman and her
newborn infant “hot” – that is to say, scalding, dangerous. Females are not as
vulnerable to the effects of other women’s “heat” (since they are, themselves,
“hot”), and female visitors drop by a maternity hut throughout the day, usually
accompanied by their younger child siblings and their own babies, if they have
any. They bring food, water and gossip about the goings-on in the village from
which the new mother is temporarily excluded.
     It was not gender-appropriate for me to sit in the maternity huts with new
mothers and other women, but the villagers regarded my enthusiasm for doing
so as just a puzzling, whiteman eccentricity. Everyone in Gapun was convinced
that I was going to get a fatal case of asthma from allowing myself to come in such
close contact with the heat of women.
                                                        Young people’s Tayap      19
     With this kind of danger in mind, whenever I wondered aloud in Gapun
whether I might be coming down with a cold or a fever, a villager was always on
hand to ruefully shake his or her head and remind me how foolish I was to put
myself at risk of bronchial collapse by sitting next to a woman who had recently
given birth. Sure, I might take special white-people’s medicine to protect against
the ravages of vaginal heat, they told me (this is how they assumed I could survive
the blasts at all), but sooner or later, they just knew, I would start spewing blood.
     Despite their expectation that I would soon be coughing out my own lungs,
both women and men seemed to enjoy my visits in the maternity huts. Men
enjoyed them because I took digital photos of the new babies and willingly
showed them to them. Before I began doing this, no adult man had ever seen a
newborn, so they were all deeply curious. Women always welcomed me because
I brought gossip and stories. They also liked looking at the photos I took of them
and their babies. I usually also brought along some kerosene that could be put
into a tin lamp, thus sparing the new mother and her baby pitch-black nights in
a lonely, wind-rattled hut.
     Because I spent so many hours in the company of young women in places
like maternity huts, and of young men in places like the rainforest when they
performed intimate and lengthy ministrations together, I came to see, over the
months, that none of these young people ever used Tayap at all. All conversations
between young people under twenty-five, in all situations, were in Tok Pisin.
Young people use Tayap words that are common in the villagers’ speech, and
that often don’t have Tok Pisin equivalents (for example, words for various birds
and plants in the forest). And they do sometimes use short formulaic phrases,
to provoke humor or to “hide talk” from any non-villager who might be in their
company or within earshot. But that is all.
     Young people do not converse, narrate, gossip, argue, tell jokes, discuss
erotic experiences or do anything else at all in Tayap.
     Once I understood this, I became better able to make sense of the mutual
recrimination that arises whenever the topic of language shift comes up in villag-
ers’ conversations. Parents blame their children for not speaking Tayap. They say
in voices dripping with irony that their children have all turned white and there-
fore they only speak the language of white people – Tok Pisin. Young people,
when mocked in this way, snap back that it’s the parents’ own fault their children
don’t speak Tayap: if they had taught them Tayap, they would be able to speak it.
     Young men and women also told me that they don’t speak Tayap because
they are ashamed. “They laugh at us”, said one twenty-one-year-old man, refer-
ring to villagers in their forties and older. “They’ll say ‘Oh, he’s someone raised
in some other village’. Or, ‘Oh! A whiteman child who doesn’t know the village
language’. They’ll make fun of us. So it’s hard to answer in the vernacular and we
20        1 The Tayap language and its speakersget mixed up.” (“Ol i save lap long mipela, ol bai kirap tok, ‘Em wanpela mangi
bilong narapela hap ia’. O ‘Ye, waitman pikinini i no save long tok ples’. Na bai
ol i wokim pani gen. Em nau, hat long bekim long tok ples bai mipela paul ia.”)
     I became curious to know if the young people’s lack of Tayap, and their shame
about speaking it, was due to the fact that they simply didn’t command it. So to
try to assess this, I began asking groups of friends, two to three at a time, to come
into my house at night to narrate stories in Tayap. Because I knew by that time
that young people didn’t speak Tayap to one another or anyone else, I expected
this task to be like pulling teeth.
     Instead, to my great surprise, it was like slicing butter.
     Not only were young villagers eager to narrate; all but the very youngest of
them were also able to narrate in Tayap. Many of the narratives were short, and
most of them were scaffolded by the narrator’s same-sex friends, who sat on the
floor with them and helped the teller remember what things were called and figure
out how verbs were inflected. But what emerged in the narrative sessions was that
all young people in the village have some active competence in the vernacular, and
some of them have excellent active competence – even though they never use it.
     Those young people who exhibited the highest-level proficiency in their
Tayap narratives (defined as speakers who spoke relatively unhesitatingly, used
a variety of pronouns, verbal statuses and verbs of motion, and who had a broad
vocabulary) constitute a kind of speaker that has not been discussed in the lit-
erature on language death. They are not exactly “passive bilinguals”, because
they are capable of active production – in a few cases, of relatively advanced
active production (Tayap Text 3, narrated by a twenty-five-year-old woman, is an
example of just how advanced).
     Nor are these young women and men quite the same as what the linguist
Nancy Dorian, in her work on language death in Scottish Gaelic communities,
once labeled “semi-speakers” (Dorian 1981). The young people of Gapun are
like the Gaelic semi-speakers that Dorian described in that they have perfect
passive competence and perfect communicative competence in the vernacular:
they understand everything said to them and they respond in culturally appro-
priate ways. But unlike Dorian’s semi-speakers (and also unlike the Australian
Dyirbal semi-speakers discussed in Schmidt 1985), young people in Gapun do not
use the vernacular in conversations with fluent speakers. On the contrary, with
the exception of lexical items and a few formulaic phrases like those mentioned
above, they never use it at all. The narratives I collected in 2009 are the only
times in their lives that the young people I recorded have ever told an entire story
in Tayap, and unless I return to Gapun and record some more, or unless some
miracle happens and the vernacular experiences a sudden renaissance, those
sessions in my house are likely the last time that anyone under twenty five will
ever even attempt to narrate an entire story in Tayap.
                                                      Young people’s Tayap      21
    Rather than calling them “passive bilinguals” or “semi-speakers”, a more
accurate name for this category of speaker might be “passive active bilingual”.
The convolutedness of that label seems fitting to describe a speaker who pos-
sesses sufficient grammatical and communicative competence in a second lan-
guage to use that language, but who never actually does use it, because social
and cultural factors make it unnecessary or undesirable to do so.
    Of particular relevance for this grammar is that there is a steady and stage-
bound grammatical erosion from passive active bilinguals to increasingly less
competent passive bilinguals. Some of this erosion includes the following:–   The five transitive verb classes become collapsed into the morphologically
    simplest conjugation class, class 5.","[37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"
"
Even though these two sentences can be translated the same way in English, they
are not synonymous in Tayap. The first example is the unmarked construction:
it is a simple declarative sentence consisting of a transitive class 1 verb stem (po)
suffixed by a 3sg.f object morpheme denoting the pig (-ku) and a subject ending
(-n) denoting ‘he’, all inflected for realis.
      The second example is marked. It contains the same verb stem inflected for
realis, but instead of the object morpheme that refers to the pig that was shot,
what follows is a morpheme that means ‘mine’, ‘the one belonging to me’ or ‘the
one whose being shot had consequences for me’. Morphemes that encode this
relation often also encode the notion of benefit, and in keeping with other lin-
guistic work on Papuan languages (e.g. Foley 1991: 307–11), here they are labeled
“benefactive”, even if the label is not entirely satisfying, because the actions
encoded by the verb do not necessarily entail benefit. In (7-29a)–(7-29b) above, for
example, the spearing of my pig may be malefactive, and it may have happened
contrary to the speaker’s knowledge, will or desire.
      The ben morphemes highlight a relationship of possession and/or the con-
sequences that an action or event have on the person or thing denoted by the
morphemes. In (7-29a) and (7-29b) above, a relation of possession is expressed
                                                        Benefactive (ben)     219
in both examples, by means of the possessive pronoun ŋaŋan ‘my’. But while
possession is evident in the first example, it is emphasized in the second, partly
through the possessive pronoun (which can be omitted in this construction) and
partly through the benefactive morphology affixed to the verb stem.
    Benefactive morphemes often occur on a transitive verb like ‘give’. Here the
possessive meaning of ‘what belongs to me’ or ‘what should belong to me’ is
evident.(7-30) isia(ta)n
       is          -ia(ta)   -n
       give.sbj -1sg.ben.r.o sg|1pl.r.s
       ‘give it to me’Benefactive object morphemes also appear when one talks about possessed items
such as body parts:(7-31)   a. kokɨr mbɨdtia(ta)n

            <3sgr.m.ben.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
            ‘the man’s spine hurts’
220         7 Mood         Note: adu ‘break’ is a class 3 transitive verb; hence the verb stem variation in these
         examples (7-31c and d; see Section 6.1.4)
Although as already noted, the benefactive morphemes do not necessarily carry
a positive meaning of benefit (something that is apparent from examples (7-31c –
7-31d) about bone-breaking), they often do express the meaning of doing some-
thing for the benefit of someone, even though it is often difficult in practice to
separate the sense of beneficiary from that of possession.
     A command like the following means both ‘Get rid of the rubbish that is in her
house’ and ‘Get rid of the house’s rubbish for her benefit’:(7-32)   patɨrŋa pipia aŋgo wostukwa(ta)n
         patɨr =ŋa       pipia         aŋgo
         house =poss rubbish (TP) dx.f         wos                -tu -kwa(ta)            -n
         get_rid_of.sbj -s <3sg.f.ben.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
         ‘get rid of this rubbish in her house‘; ‘get rid of this house’s rubbish for her’The following command is similar: it means both ‘Light my cigarette’ and ‘Light
my cigarette for me’.(7-33)   ŋaŋan sokoi wototia(ta)n
         ŋaŋan       sokoi       woto       -t -ia(ta)     -n
         1sg.poss cigarette light.irr -s <1sg.ben.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
         ‘light my cigarette’; ‘light my cigarette for me’Because they foreground a relationship of possession or one in which an agent
has been affected by an action or event, benefactive object morphemes can be
affixed to any verb stem – even an intransitive, stative verb like ‘be’.
     One old woman once told a story of how she upbraided her teenage son for
taking money out of her net bag without her permission. “Yesterday you cried for
me to give you money”, she recounted herself saying, “and I gave you two kina to
buy biscuits, which you bought and ate”1.
     After having established her prior generosity, the woman continued, saying
in a self-pitying voice:
1 The kina, from the Tok Pisin word for ‘clam’, is Papua New Guinea’s main unit of currency.

       ‘my 3 kina is there’; i.e. it’s all I have leftHere the benefactive morphemes foreground the speaker as both possessing and
being directly affected by the presence of the three kina. Not only are her three
kina there; they are three kina that are there specifically for her benefit and use.

222        7 MoodBecause benefactive morphemes are object/undergoer-like morphemes, they
occur in the expected object slot in a verb’s architecture, thus precluding the
appearance of the object marker. Note that a coreferential NP can appear with
the object marker: see for example (7-37a) below. And like the other object mor-
phemes that have been discussed and exemplified throughout this grammar, the
benefactive object morphemes are marked as either realis or irrealis.
    The forms of the benefactive object marker can be compared to those of the
(non-benefactive) object morphemes:         non-benefactive object     benefactive object

As mentioned above, the realis markers in parenthesis (ta) are optional and
frequently omitted.

express expectation, supposition and surprise. Two of these particles – awa and
mera – occur with both verbs and other parts of speech. Kapa modifies only
nouns and adjectives and nímera occurs with only verbs.","[238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243]"
"9.1 Simple sentencesA simple sentence in Tayap may consist of no more than an inflected verb. Thus,
a complex predicate like the serial verb construction discussed throughout the
previous chapter, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana ‘she intends to carry him down on her
shoulders’ is a fully formed sentence in Tayap. A simpler example is:(9-1) puko
      come_up.3pl.r
      ‘they came up’Word order is relatively flexible, since the grammatical relations of core constit-
uents and other elements are expressed through morphology and potentially
marked on NPs by case clitics like the ergative. However, Tayap is a verb-final
language and the unmarked order of elements in a declarative intransitive
sentence is Subject-Verb (SV), and in a declarative transitive sentence Subject-
Object-Verb (AOV):         subject        verb

the order of object and oblique is fairly free, with the caveat that the object
never follows the verb, while the oblique argument can. Also, the subject nor-
mally occurs in the sentence-initial position. Some examples of various word
orders follow:          subject     direct     verb                                     oblique

clause types.","[270, 271, 272]"
"5.3 Object (o) and subject (s/a) suffixes5.3.1 Object suffixesBefore going on to discuss the range of TAM distinctions made in Tayap, it will
be useful to distinguish the various forms of the object and subject suffixes that,
together with the verb stems, encode TAM on a verb.
     Taking the object suffixes first, note how their forms in irrealis are simply
the realis forms with an r inserted before the vowel in all cases except 1sg, which
retains the same form in both statuses. Interestingly, only the 3pl is distinguished
from the other non-singular suffixes in both paradigms:

5.3.2 Subject (S/A) suffixesTayap’s subject (S/A) suffixes can be compared in Tables 5.2 and 5.3 below. Irrealis
subject suffixes only mark gender for singular subjects, and realis subject suffixes
do not mark gender at all. Both paradigms collapse second person non-singular,
they distinguish third person plural, and they collapse first and third person
dual. Note that these complex syncretisms are different in different paradigms
(see Section 3.5 for other pronoun paradigms, including the free pronouns and
benefactive suffixes).","[164, 165]"
"Villagers’ debates and language shiftSomething similar to the ‘wind problem’ occurred with a word that I would have
thought was common and uncontroversial – the word for ‘rainbow’. One morning
344        Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionaryafter a night of heavy rain, a large rainbow appeared in the sky. On my way to
wash my clothes in one of the village waterholes, I saw the rainbow and realized
that I didn’t know what it was called in Tayap. So I asked the first person I saw – a
fluent speaker of Tayap in his late thirties – what one calls a rainbow in Tayap.
     “Renbo”, he responded, without missing a beat.
     Um, no, I told him, that must be the Tok Pisin word – the Tayap word had to be
something else. The man told me that in that case, he didn’t know, and that I should
go ask his father, sixty-five-year-old Monei Mbanaŋ, who was my main language
informant at the time. I went off to find Monei and thus did my innocent query
launch a month of acrimonious debate from one end of the village to the other.
     I found Monei sitting on his veranda and I asked him the word for rainbow.
He pondered for awhile. He told me he couldn’t remember the word offhand; he
needed to think about it. He thought for several days. Finally, he told me that
‘rainbow’ had no single word in Tayap; instead, ‘rainbow’ was expressed by the
verb phrase akɨn tamtiek, ‘cloud is marked with color’. This sounded reasonable
to me, and I duly recorded it. But when I repeated it to other speakers to check
their reactions, I was universally met with disdain. “Em giaman” – ‘He’s lying’,
everyone sneered, using their favorite expression to dismiss another speaker’s
expertise in Tayap. Even though no one could think of the correct term themselves,
they all told me they knew that the phrase Monei had volunteered was wrong.
     Days went by and no one could come up with ‘rainbow’. Older villagers
explained to me that their parents and older relatives had warned them about
rainbows, saying they should never walk underneath one, because if they did,
their minds would become clouded and confused. But even though they remem-
bered these cautions, no senior speaker could recall the word for ‘rainbow’
that their parents and relatives had used while articulating them. The word for
‘rainbow’, villagers told me, “i hait” – it was hiding. (In the villagers’ defense, I
should note that rainbows are not exactly common occurrences in Gapun – I only
saw that one the entire eight months I was there in 2009).
     Eventually Monei’s old wife, Sopak Waiki, told me that she had a dream in
which the true word for ‘rainbow’ had been whispered to her by a dead ancestor.
The word, she revealed, was mɨnuomb – a word that otherwise means ‘large
round lake’. Sopak said that the way to say ‘rainbow’ in Tayap was to say akɨnnɨ
mɨnuomb utok, ‘a round lake appeared in the clouds’.
     I told other senior speakers of Sopak’s revelation. They were unmoved. “Em
giaman”, they all pronounced, impassively.
     A few days later, one of the oldest men in the village told me that he had
remembered the word – it was wagurmos.
     The other speakers’ judgement fell predictably: “Em giaman”, they all said.
They explained that wagurmos meant the white film one sees in the sky at night
                                          Villagers’ debates and language shift     345
– that is, the Milky Way. It doesn’t mean ‘rainbow’ at all. Many older speakers also
took the opportunity to disparage the linguistic knowledge of the old man who
had offered wagurmos. That speaker may be old, they said belittlingly, but he’s
“lapun nating” – he’s grown old without having learned anything. All he has,
people said, is “bebi sens” – the sense of a baby.
     Weeks passed and frustration grew. But finally, having heard about the
senior speakers’ search for ‘rainbow’, a young man in his 30s one day came and
told me that he had once heard his grandfather, Kruni Ayarpa, say the word for
‘rainbow’. Kruni had been one of my language informants in the 1980s; he died
in the early 1990s. For the last few decades of his life, Kruni had been universally
respected and vaguely feared as an elder who knew everything about Gapun’s
history and who spoke flawless and eloquent Tayap. The young man reported
that as a child, he had once been together with Kruni when women from the
neighboring village of Wongan mentioned rainbows, which are called mamor in
their Kopar language. They asked Kruni what the word in Tayap was. Kruni told
them that it was mamar.
     Rather than being a breakthrough, this word, too, was rejected. “It means
‘banana’”, all the old people responded dryly when, without telling them why, I
asked them to define mamar. And indeed, it does mean a kind of banana. But in
the end, unable to come up with a word or expression that satisfied them all, and
undoubtedly growing annoyed at my persistence in questioning them, the older
villagers begrudgingly agreed that mamar must be the word for ‘rainbow’ too,
since Kruni apparently had claimed it was.
     My own conclusion is that mamar probably was the Tayap word for ‘rainbow’.
Tayap and Kopar share quite a few nouns, because speakers of the two languages
have been in contact with one another for a very long time. The kind of slight
phonetic variation between mamor and mamar are common in the words shared
by the two languages. For example:                        Tayap                 Kopar
  crocodile             orem                  oreo
  cockatoo              kaimwa                keimwa
  turtle                pawp                  pup
  lorikeet              njijerɨk              njijerɨŋ
  hook                  pipiŋgabu             bibigabuFor those all those reasons, I have entered ‘rainbow’ as one of the definitions of
mamar. I recount the little epic of finally getting that word, though, in order to
illustrate the fact that not all of the entries contained in this dictionary will satisfy
all the current speakers of Tayap.
346        Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionary     In fact, this inability to satisfy all the current speakers of a Tayap is a feature
of the language that may be contributing to its demise. I was continually struck by
how vigorously (and, to my mind, how gratuitously) senior speakers of Tayap dis-
counted and ridiculed one another’s linguistic competence. Early on, I stopped
trying to discuss Tayap in groups of old people because any discussion of any
aspect of the language would inevitably result in bickering. Speakers might even-
tually grouchily agree on whatever it was I was asking them about, but later on,
they would always arrange a private moment with me to heartily dismiss the
knowledge and opinions of their fellow speakers.
     While it escapes no one’s attention that Tayap is a tiny language spoken
nowhere else but in Gapun (and by Gapun villagers living in the neighboring
village of Wongan), knowledge about language is regarded as a private, rather than
a communal, possession. This way of thinking about language is an extension of
the villagers’ more general ethos of ownership. Gapun villagers would shake their
heads in absolute bewilderment at the persistent Western stereotypes about how
a rainforest-dwelling people like themselves supposedly eschew ownership and
share their natural resources in a kind of prelapsarian socialist ecological bliss.
     On the contrary. In Gapun, nothing is communal, nothing is equally owned
and shared by everyone. Everything – every area of land, every sago palm, every
coconut palm, every mango tree, every pot, plate, axe, machete, discarded spear
shaft, broken kerosene lamp, and every anything else one can think of – is owned
by someone (including people’s names and the right to bestow them, as well
as knowledge of myths, songs, and curing chants). Villagers guard their rights
of ownership energetically and they defend them loudly (see Kulick 1992 for an
extended discussion of this that is as relevant today as it was twenty years ago).
     This understanding of possession and ownership has consequences for lan-
guage: it means that the sociolinguistic truism of a common “shared” language
has little purchase in Gapun. In their own view, villagers don’t “share” a lan-
guage. Instead, each speaker owns his or her own version of the language. And
the older those speakers become, the more they regard their version as the proper
one and everyone else’s as “giaman” (false, a lie; takwat in Tayap). This absence
of a language ideology that regards a common language as something “shared”
means that speakers are predisposed to not regard the loss of Tayap as particu-
larly traumatic. Fluent elder speakers still have ‘their’ Tayap; if younger speakers
don’t possess a version of it as, well, “wari bilong ol”. That’s their problem.","[363, 364, 365, 366]"
"SynonymsWhere no example or explanation is given between two cross-referenced words that
mean the same thing, I have been unable to elicit any difference in meaning. Examples
are ŋgakraw and ndadab, both of which mean ‘peel’, i.e. the skin of a fruit or vege-
table that has been removed. My questions about difference in meaning were consis-
tently answered with a version of the following: “If you want to say ŋgakraw, you’ll
say ŋgakraw. If you want to say ndadab you’ll say ndadab. They mean the same”
(“Yu laik tok ŋgakraw bai yu tok ŋgakraw. Na yu laik tok ndadab bai yu tok ndadab.
Em wankain mining tasol”). Or I would sometimes be told “wanpela mining na tok
i bruk”: there’s one meaning but the talk (i.e. the language) is broken, or fractured.

     In some cases – for example, two different verbs that mean ‘sweep’: mburai
(class 5) and mburai-(p)-i (class 1) – the words are true synonyms (although in this
case, it is clear that the verb is mburai; in the class 1 form it is constructed with i- ‘give’).
     In other cases, the difference in the meaning of two words may have been lost.
I suspect, for example, that the two words for ‘bridge’, koŋgrik and nɨmɨrkokɨr,
at one time referred to different kinds of bridges – made of different material,
spanning different bodies of water or constructed in different ways. However, I
was unable to elicit any difference in meaning from the most senior speakers in
the village. Whatever difference may have existed is now forgotten.","[362, 363]"
"What makes this system difficult for young speakers of the language is that there
is little predictability about which verbs fall into which conjugation classes. For
example, most verb stems that begin with a are class 3 verbs. However, some, like
and-(p)-o ‘awaken’, and amai-(p)-i ‘search for’ are not (they are both class 1 verbs).
      Another example: it is impossible to know, if one only hears the non-future form
of a verb like parkun ‘I filled it up’, whether the verb is a class 1 verb (in which case
168         6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsthe stem would be ar), a class 2 verb (in which case the stem would be war) or a class
5 verb, in which case the stem would be par. (It turns out that ‘fill up’ is a class 2 verb.)
     A similar problem presents itself with a verb like ‘let go’, ‘release’. Even if one
knows that a future form of this verb is orekrutak, ‘she will release it’ (or ‘you (f) will
release it’), one can only guess as to whether its non-future form will be porekun
(class 1) or oretukun (class 5), both of which are entirely possible – but both of which
are wrong. It turns out that the verb is a class 1 verb, but the expected p appears after
the e, rather than before the o, thus rendering orepekun (‘she released it’).
     What follows below is detailed discussion of the five classes for transitive verbs.","[187, 188]"

3.1.3.4 Gender in young people’s Tayap
Young speakers are aware that Tayap marks gender, and they know how to mark
it on verb stems, object suffixes, subject suffixes and through ergative markers.
     A problem they have, though, is keeping straight the forms that mark mascu-
line gender from the ones that mark feminine gender. This problem can be exem-
plified by a short extract from a narrative told by an eighteen-year-old woman.
     This young woman is telling a story about a crocodile that she and some other
young women caught in the mangrove swamp. The women tied the 1.5 meter-long
crocodile’s jaws together, put it in a copra bag and brought it home. It lived for a
while, then, the speaker recounts, her father killed it (forms that express gender
are in bold):
62        3 Word classes(3-24) orem aŋgi wuk embre sasŋi poŋgɨn
       orem      aŋgi wuk         emb    =re   sas    =ŋi
       crocodile dx.f be.3sg.f.r morning =temp father =erg.m       po        -ŋgɨ           -n
       strike.r -3sg.m.r.o      -sg|1pl.s
       ‘the (female) crocodile was there, in the morning (male) father killed him’All the words and morphemes that express gender are correctly formed. The mas-
culine ergative case morpheme on ‘father’ is also the correct one. But note that
the grammatical gender of the crocodile here changes from feminine to masculine
in the course of a single utterance. Crocodiles are generally masculine in Tayap,
so the final verb here, poŋgɨn, is exactly what a fluent speaker would say. But the
deictic word used by this young speaker, aŋgi, as well as the first verb, wuk, are
semantically incorrect – they are the feminine forms, but what the speaker wants
are the masculine forms: ainde kut.
     If the speaker had been talking about a female crocodile (for example if the
crocodile had been found to be carrying eggs), then the deictic aŋgi and the verb
wuk would have been correct. But in that case, the final verb should have had a fem-
inine object morpheme – it should have been po-ku-n (kill.r-3sg.f.r.o-sg|1pl.s).
     This kind of gender-mixing is characteristic of young speakers. Generally
speaking, the younger and less competent the speaker, the more gender will be
mixed in haphazard ways like this. As in many other areas of Tayap grammar, it
is clear that young speakers know that a particular distinction is expressed in the
vernacular. They are also capable of producing some of the forms that mark the
distinction. What they lack is the capacity to realize the distinction in a grammat-
ically consistent manner.
     In Young People’s Dyirbal, a situation of language death in Australia, weaker
speakers changed the semantic gender assignment system to a simple animacy/
gender system. That is, they kept the morphology and rearranged the class assign-
ment system (Schmidt 1985). That is the opposite situation to what is happening
with Tayap: here, the assignment principles remain but what is changed is that
the morphological marking has become inconsistent.","[81, 82]"
"7.6.1 Expectation and impatience (exp)The particle awa, which occurs initially or in the case of (7-39), after the subject,
carries a connotation of expectation tinged with slight or potential impatience or
disapproval. In the 1980s, senior men translated some occurrences of awa for me
with the Tok Pisin word “watpo” (‘what for’). “Watpo” is a demand that one can
easily imagine being shouted at black plantation workers by white colonial over-
seers. In the speech of the senior Gapun men, it was an interrogative that retained
an aggressive or exasperated tone that didn’t so much mean ‘why?’ as it meant,
‘Why in the world…? or ‘Why the hell…?’.
224           7 Mood    By 2009, awa was rarely heard in Tayap speech, and the instances of the word I
heard in the speech of senior villagers did not express overt disapproval. However,
they did seem to indicate that what was being referred to was anticipated or
overdue. So note the difference in meaning between two sentences, one of which
uses the simple interrogative, and the other which uses the modal particle awa:(7-38) a.      Speaker A:    wek-ara
                             come.3sg.f.r-perf
                             ‘she has arrived’               Speaker B:    Ndamor=ke?
                             Ndamor=q
                             ‘who, Ndamor?         b.    Speaker A:    wek-ara
                             come.3sg.f.r-perf
                             ‘she has arrived’               Speaker B:    Ndamor awa?
                             Ndamor exp
                             ‘it must be Ndamor?’Another example occurred when an old woman was waiting for a piece of meat
to be heated on a fire. At one point during a conversation about other things, she
asked a girl who was looking after the meat:(7-39)   ŋgu      awa mborsip tandiu pipiek?
         3sg.f exp pork          well cook.3sg.f.r
         ‘is the pork cooked enough?’Once again, this question is not simply a request for information; it expresses an
expectation. In the next example, given to me by a senior man in the 1980s, men
in Gapun were ready to fight men from the neighboring village of Sanae. All pre-
pared to fight, the Gapun men could ask one another in anticipatory excitement:(7-40) awa ŋgɨ ai                -ki   -ndak?
       exp 3pl come.irr -irr -3pl.irr
       ‘Will they come?’; i.e. ‘Do you think they’ll really come?’
                                                                    Mood particles          225
When it occurs together with a negated verb, the sense of expectation is height-
ened. Contrast the following two sentences:(7-41)   a. awa mbet
            exp come.r.1sg.m|3sg.m.r
            ‘he should come’ (i.e. ‘I expect he will come’)         a. awa ai-ki              wákare
            exp come.irr-irr neg
            ‘he must have arrived’Because it carries a sense of expectation, this construction is similar in meaning
to the admonitive mood discussed in Section 7.3. For example, the following two
sentences both mean something similar:(7-42)   a. awa Kemma orasambgi nirru wákare
            awa Kem =ma      ora      samb =gi
            exp Kem =poss thing pl            =erg.pl                nir         -ru        wákare
                make.irr -2sg.irr.o neg
                ‘it must be Kem’s things [i.e. his connections with the spirit world]
                that are making you sick’ (in Tok Pisin: “Nogut ol samting bilong Kem
                i mekim yu”)         b. Kemma orasambgi nirŋgarana
            Kem =ma         ora    samb =gi           nir          -ŋgarana
            Kem =poss thing pl             =erg.pl make.irr -adm.sg|1pl
            ‘it wouldn’t be good if it’s Kem’s things [i.e. his connections with the
            spirit world] that are making you sick’ (same Tok Pisin translation as
            above).22 This example is marked by non-agreement between the plural noun (orasamb, ‘things’) and
the plural ergative morpheme (=gi) affixed to the noun, and the singular inflection (-ŋgarana) on
the verb ‘make’ (nir). One would expect the plural ending –ŋgroana ( so ‘nirŋgroana’ see Section
7.3).
    It is probable that this example takes the form it does because the plural noun orak samb
(‘things’) is usually treated as a singular entity. So speakers say:     ŋgan orasamb wuk aŋgi
     ŋgan        orak      samb     wuk           aŋgi
     3pl.poss    thing     pl       be.3sg.f.r    dx
     ‘their things are there’ (lit. ‘their things is there’)
226         7 MoodAlthough they clearly are not identical in meaning, sentences like these two both
express an anxiety in relation to, or an expectation about, an event.","[243, 244, 245, 246]"

2.4 Vowel harmonyVowel harmony and regressive assimilation are characteristic features of Tayap
verbs. The vowel of the object morpheme often influences the vowel of the verb
stem or subject morpheme that precedes it.
    Compare, for example, the following two forms of the verb ‘set down’:
(2-5) a. ŋa=yi        ŋgu ŋgun      -nu -ku         -n
         1sg=erg.f 3sg.f set_down.r -s  <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.s
         ‘I set her down’
36       2 Phonology and orthography
      b. ŋa=yi        ŋɨ  ŋgɨn      -nɨ -ŋgɨ       -n
         1sg=erg.f 3sg.m set_down.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.s
         ‘I set him down’The same process is evident in the subject markers of the following verb, ‘collect’:(2-6) a. ŋgu=yi       korat  -tu                 -ku               -n
         3sg.f=erg collect.r -s                  <3sg.f.r. o>      -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
         ‘she collected it’     b. ŋgu=yi       korat          -tɨ         -mbɨ            -n
        3sg.f=erg collect.r         -s          <3pl.r.o>       -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
        ‘she collected them’Note how the vowel immediately preceding the object suffix changes according
to whether the object suffix contains a mid vowel or a back vowel. That it is the
vowel in the object suffix that influences the vowel in the verb stem, and not vice
versa, is clear from the fact that object suffixes are invariant – they are the same
for all verb stems (see Sections 3.5, 5.3.1 and 5.3.2).
     In (2-6a) and (2-6b), the morpheme preceding the object is the first part of
a discontinuous subject morpheme. The vowel in that morpheme, which will
always be /u/ or /ɵ/, is often either reduced to a schwa or is omitted altogether,
especially if it occurs after /n/ or medially between /k/ and /ɾ/. For example:(2-7) a. ŋɨŋi koranukun (pronounced korankun)
         ŋɨ=ŋi         kora    -nu -ku          -n
         3sg.m=erg collect.r -s     <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.s
         ‘he collected it’      b. ninukun (pronounced ninkun)
         ni      -nu -ku                -n
         do.r -s       <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.s
         ‘I (m or f) did it’, ‘he did it’, ‘she did it’, ‘we did it’
                                                                     Stress       37
The orthography used in this grammar and dictionary reflects the vowel deletion.
Note that in those cases when the vowel was not pronounced, it is not written in
the word.
     The only other phonotactic rule involving vowels is that following the bila-
bial nasal /m/ or a velar stop, a vowel can acquire the semivowel /w/, a case of
progressive rounding, as described for Sougb by Reesink (2002a); e.g.:(2-8) a. suman ‘big’       → sumwan
      b. Mukar (male name) → mukwaɾ
      c. a-ŋgar            → aŋgwaɾ
         be.irr-nfn.sg
         ‘being’2.5 StressStressed syllables are realized as louder and longer than unstressed syllables.
Stress in Tayap is generally not phonemic, and unpredictable stress occurs rarely.
In the dictionary, unpredictable stress occurs on roughly two percent of words.
     Stress usually falls on the final syllable of an uninflected word (but see below
for more information about stress on bound morphemes):(2-9) ambagái ‘men’s house’       ndugubár ‘backbone’
      karép ‘moon’                 ŋayár ‘really’

      makatók ‘green coconut’      tumbúr ‘shoulder’
      minjiké ‘betel nut’          wekók ‘obscenity’There are a number of non-predictable exceptions to the syllable-final rule. The
orthography used in this grammar and dictionary marks stress explicitly on those
exceptional words. Examples of two-syllable words with non-final stress:    mbímaŋ ‘leech’
    símbu ‘maggot’Examples of longer words with non-final stress:
38          2 Phonology and orthography(2-10) arúmbatak ‘fly’                  pasákeke ‘frog’

        nekénduko ‘sharp grass’         wákare ‘no’Syllables with unpredictable stress are far more common with the vowel a than
the other vowels. In the dictionary more than three times as many instances occur
with a as with any other vowel.
    In general, stress is a property of a lexical morpheme, not an inflected word,
and thus stress placement is retained under affixation. For example:     munjé ‘man’ munjénum ‘men’
     mɨrí ‘forest’ mɨrínɨ ‘in the forest’There are some minimal pairs differentiated only by stress:(2-11) a. verb stem tar                                tánkun ‘I heard it’

Tayap has a six-way distinction for singular referents – three for feminine ref-
erents and three for masculine referents. As in other parts of Tayap grammar,
the gender distinction collapses in the plural, and here the language maintains a
two-way distinction:

Note that the three-way distance distinction in the singular and two-way in the
plural is highly unusual and may in fact be a simplification: the middle term in
the singular could in fact be a close-to-addressee term or expressing other prag-
matic factors (see e.g. Wilkins 1999).5
     In addition to the words listed above, Tayap also has a number of slightly
different deictic words. They are as follows:
Feminine               Masculine                       Pluralaŋgok…aŋgo             aindet….ende ‘this …here’
                                   6
                                                       aŋgeb…aŋge
‘this... here’         anɨndet…ende/inde/ide/de        ‘these…there’
aŋgudek…aŋgu           ‘that…there’                    aŋgɨb… aŋgɨb ‘those…
‘that…there’                                           there’The first or second words in these pairs can occur alone functioning as an argu-
ment of a verb phrase. During a disagreement between two men, for example, one
protagonist responded to the other’s threats to come and beat him up with the
dismissive snort addressed to everybody who was listening:6(3-84) aindetŋike oyin?
       aindet      =ŋi       =ke o          -yi -n?
       that_one =erg.m =q strike.irr -1sg.irr.o -sg|1pl.irr.s
       ‘that one there is going to hit me?’These topicalizing deictic words often co-occur, sometimes multiple times in an
utterance.7 They can be post-posed to a noun to emphasize it, for example in
response to a question like ‘Who did it?’:5 We thank Anna Margetts for this observation.
6 The second word here, ende, can also be realized as inde, ide or de
7 It is possible that these instances might more felicitously be labeled “focusing”, “highlight-
ing” or “emphasizing” rather than topicalizing (Reesink 2014). More information and analysis
on the functions of all these deicitics is needed.
                                                                Deictics (dx)     95

          dx.m man         dx.m crazy     dx.m
          ‘this man is crazy’A third set of related deictic words are demonstrative identifiers, which indicate
particularity and presence, e.g. ‘it’s me’, or ‘I’m here’ (as opposed to being away
somewhere). The term “demonstrative identifiers” comes from Diessel (1999).
These words function in a similar way to how an adverb like ecco functions in the
Italian eccomi – ‘it’s me’ or ‘here I am’. So the most common response to a ques-
tion like ‘Who are you?’ – asked, for example when one hears someone approach-
ing in the pitch blackness of a moonless night – is Ŋa ainda (‘it’s me’).    ainda    used with ŋa (1sg.m and 1sg.f)
                       yu (2sg.m and 2sg.f)
                       yim (1pl)
                       yum (2pl)
    ainde    used with ŋɨ (3sg.m)
    aŋgo(de) used with ŋgu (3sg.f)
    aŋge(de) used with ŋgɨ (3sg.pl) and dlThese words are virtually obligatory with many verbs, such as aku ‘be’, in the
sense that even though it would be grammatically correct to just say ŋɨ kut (‘he’s
here’), it is pragmatically awkward. One should say ŋɨ ainde kut (‘he dx.m is here’).
    Finally, in addition to all the deictic forms listed above, Tayap also has a
quasi-deictic suffix -me, which means ‘yes, indeed, that one (or those) as opposed
to any other or others’, occurring on pronouns.
    -me is also used to emphasize a referent, for example:(3-87) a. ŋgɨme aŋgi ŋgwokara
          ŋgɨ -me aŋgi ŋgwok          -ara
          3pl -dx dx.pl go.3pl.r -perf
          ‘they’re indeed the ones who left’ (as opposed to some other people
          having left)

          ‘Stop doing that!’The suffix -me occurs just prior to the deictic aŋgi in one of the most frequently
heard phrases in Tayap: ŋguméŋgi. This phrase – a contracted form of ŋgu-me aŋgi
(3sg.f-me + aŋgi) – means ‘yes, that way’, ‘that’s right’ (“em nau” in Tok Pisin).","[113, 114, 115, 116]"
"7.6.2 Supposition (supp)Another particle, mera, marks the epistemic status of an action or event as some-
thing that has been assumed but that the speaker believes does not correspond to
what actually happened. In other words, it is what Tayap speakers use to convey
a meaning like ‘I thought Paita had gone to Wongan’. A statement like that in
English conveys a belief that regardless of whether or not Paita did go to Wongan,
the speaker expected him to but believes that he did not.
     The modal particle mera that carries this meaning follows whatever part of
speech is the focus of the assumption. So it can occur after a noun, as in the
following:(7-43)   ŋa ndɨ nda namnak Ŋgemanŋi mera
         ŋa ndɨ nda nam           -nak         Ŋgeman =ŋi          mera
         1sg dm dm talk.r -1sg.f|1pl.r Ŋgeman =erg.m supp
         ‘I (f) thought it was Ŋgeman’ (who did it, but it wasn’t)Most commonly, mera follows a verb, thereby reframing what would have been a
statement as a supposition. For example:(7-44) ŋa namnet ŋɨ Potore okɨnet mera
       ŋa nam -net                   ŋɨ Poto  =re
       1sg talk.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r 3sg.m Wongan =all         o         -kɨ   -net             mera
         go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr supp
         ‘I (m) thought he would go to Wongan’ (but he didn’t)Without the modal particle, this sentence would mean ‘I thought: he will go
to Wongan’. Mera turns the statement into an assumption that, moreover, the
speaker believes did not come to pass. Note that these constructions always
involve the use of a phrase like ‘I thought’ or ‘I lied’ as exemplified here.
    The particle is also to express the action of having been fooled or lied to. So
‘they lied to us that you were dead’ is:

translation would be the expression ‘that damned X’ in both its positive and neg-
ative valences; so both ‘That damned kid really did well’ and ‘That damned cat
peed on my sofa’. Kapa follows pronouns, nouns and noun phrases, as in the
following examples:(7-46) a. ŋgu kapa weka numŋan noŋortakara
          ŋgu   kapa wek             -a    num   =ŋa

228         7 Mood7.6.4 Surprise counter to expectation (cs)Nímera expresses surprise that a situation has turned out contrary to one’s
expectations. It is a combination of the adverb, ni, which expresses a negative
state – the state of doing nothing or having nothing (see Section 3.4.1) – with the
suppositional particle mera (see above Section 7.6.2).
    An example that senior speakers used to explain the particle is as follows:
You tell another person to complete some work and then you leave them, thinking
that the person will not do the work. When you return, you find that the person
actually has done the work, at which point you might say:(7-47)   ŋa ndɨ yu nímera kut                       inda
         1sg dm 2sg cs               be.r.sg.m.r dx.m
         ‘I thought you (m) just were here’ (doing nothing, but you weren’t, you
         actually worked) (lit: ‘I was like, you just were here’)Another example is that people have come to your house and you expect them to
help you do some work, but they don’t. You might say:(7-48) yum nímera a           -ku -nana      mbekem?
       2pl cs          be.irr -irr intent come.2pl.r
       ‘So you’ve all come just to be here?’ (and do nothing even though I
       expected you to work?)A final example is that you are carving something and you want to make it look
like an object you have seen before – perhaps a small statue with a traditional
pattern. In the course of carving the piece, though, it ends up looking very differ-
ent from what you expected. Nímera here expresses the surprise you feel at this:(7-49) ŋa ndɨ nímera nirkrunana wákare ŋa ninukun
       ŋa ndɨ nímera nir              -kru         -nana

         neg      1sg make.r -s        <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
         ‘I thought it would turn out differently than the way it turned out’ (lit. ‘I
         intended to make it [one way], no, I made it [another way]’)
8 Complex predicates8.1 Complex predicates and complex clausesIn Tayap, the major division in complex structures is between combining verbs
versus combining clauses. Verb combining in Tayap is accomplished through
complex predicates, which can be serial verb constructions or complex predi-
cates involving the verb ‘to be’. Clause combining is of three types: Coordinate,
subordinate and cosubordinate constructions.
    This chapter deals with complex predicates, and the following chapter
(Chapter 9) deals with clause combining.","[246, 247, 248, 249]"
"(2) In those cases where all that follows an entry for an intransitive verb is
    parentheses with endings like (-net/-nak), this means that the verb stem
    remains the same between realis and irrealis. The realis person-endings of
    these verbs can be reckoned through the following steps:
    (a) remove the irrealis suffix -ki, -kɨ or -ku (in the case of ‘say’ or ’talk’, it is
         -kɨ). This leaves only the verb stem (nam);
    (b) suffix the appropriate subject endings to that stem.
                                    Complex predicates and non-final verb objects    341
The endings (-net/-nak) provided in the entry for ‘say, ‘talk’ indicate what those
approriate subject endings are. The parentheses indicates that nam takes the endings
(-net/-nak) in realis. These endings are detailed in Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of the
Grammar. In this case, (-net/-nak) indicate that nam is a Group I intransitive verb.
Checking Section 6.2.1, one sees that the full realis conjugation of nam is as follows :  1sgm         ŋa                nam           -net (m)      ‘I (m) said’
  1sgf         ŋa                nam           -nak (f)      ‘I (f) said’
  2sgm         yu                nam           -tet (m)      ‘you (m) said’
  2sgf         yu                nam           -tak (f)      ‘you (f) said’
  3sgf         ŋgu               nam           -tak          ‘she said’
  3sgm         ŋɨ                nam           -net          ‘he said’
  1pl          yim               nam-          -nak          ‘we said’
  2pl          yum               nam           -nkem         ‘you pl. said’
  3pl          ŋgɨ               nam           -tuko         ‘they said’
  dl           yim sene/         nam           -tike         ‘we two said’/
               ŋgɨ sene                                      ‘they two said’  Note: for a discussion of how the dual forms are used in Tayap, see Section 3.5
  and the discussion of examples (3-73) and (3-74).","[360, 361]"
"
     It is evident that all the endings in the four groups listed above are variants
of the following endings:      1sg.f, 2sg.f, 1pl      →    k
      1sg.m, 2sg.m           →    t
      2pl                    →    kem

      dl                     →    keMost intransitive verbs in Tayap fall into one of the above conjugation groups of
verbs. Below are some examples of verb roots that are inflected according to the
patterns listed above:
  Group I, -net/-nak                                 Group II, -iet/-iek

    yu ‘you’                                                   kar-iet (m) / kar-iek (f)
    ŋɨ ‘he’               a in the root becomes ka-            kar-iet
    yim ‘we’                                                   kar-iek

                          a in the root becomes o-

                          the ending is -iek
194         6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsSeveral of the verbs in this subgroup have two equally possible forms in the 3pl
form: either the above form with ŋgo- + -iek, or o- + -ko.
    Consider for example amuku ‘fight’:(6-39) ŋa ‘I’               kam-iet (m) / kam-iek (f)
       yu ‘you’             kam-iet (m) / kam-iek (f)
       ŋɨ ‘he’              kam-iet
       ŋgu ‘she’            om-iek
       yim ‘we’             kam-iek
       yum ‘you pl’         kam-kem
       ŋgɨ ‘they’           ŋgom-iek or om-ko
       dl                   om-ke6.2.2.2 Group IIb, verb stems that alternate between t and r
Like class 4 transitive verbs, some intransitive verb stems that begin with r change
to t in the realis. The subject part includes an element that varies between t and
n. For example:
(6-40) rewkɨ ‘be afraid’
          ŋa ‘I’                 tew-niet (m) / tew-niek (f)
          yu ‘you’               tew-niet (m) / tew-niek (f)
          ŋɨ ‘he’                tew-niet
          ŋgu ‘she’              tew-tiek
          yim ‘we’               tew-niek
          yum ‘you pl’           tew-nkem
          ŋgɨ ‘they’             tew-tuko
          dl                     tew-tɨke6.2.2.3 Group IVa, verb stems that begin with a
Here the alternation is the same as in group IIa, above, with the difference that
those forms of the verb that there are realized as o (i.e. the inflections for 3sg.f
and dl) are here realized as u, with some other variations. For example:
                 arkɨ ‘go inside’            atɨkɨ ‘appear’, ‘go down’ŋa ‘I’           kar-ot (m) / kar-ok (f)     kat-ot (m) / kat-ok (f)
yu ‘you’         kar-ot (m) / kar-ok (f)     kat-ot (m) / kat-ok (f)
ŋgu ‘she’        ur-ok                       ut-ok
ŋɨ ‘he’          kar-ot                      kat-ot

196          6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbs6.2.3 Intransitive verbs in young people’s TayapIntransitive verbs present young speakers with even greater problems than tran-
sitive verbs. The unpredictable nature of the subject endings, as well as many of
the stem changes between the irrealis and the realis forms, leave increased scope
for uncertainty and mistakes.
     Many of the mistakes that young speakers make when inflecting intransitive
verbs are similar to the errors they make when they try to inflect transitive verbs.
Verb stem alternations are often disregarded, and young speakers inflect verbs by
mixing irrealis stems with realis subject endings. Examples are:
(6-41)   a. *muŋg      -ot
            stand.irr -sg.m.r
            ‘he stood’instead of         b. puŋg      -ot
            stand.r -sg.m.r
            ‘he stood’
            verb root muŋguku ‘stand’(6-42) a. *rɨp         -tɨke
          go_first.irr -dl.r
          ‘they two went first’instead of         b. tɨp         -tɨke
            go_first.r -dl.r
            ‘they two went first’
            verb root rɨpkɨ ‘stand’(6-43)   a. *amb      -tak
            hide.irr -2sg|3sg.f.r
            ‘she hid’instead of

           b. ombiek
              hide.r.3sg.f.|1pl.r
              ‘she hid’
              verb root ambuku ‘hide’Looking at the verb stems in the (b) examples here and comparing them to
the forms that young speakers produce in the corresponding (a) examples, it
is clear that the young speakers have a strong sense of the root forms of the
verbs they want to inflect. Once again, though, they lack the ability to produce
the correct inflections. In many cases, the forms they produce are intelligible –
anyone hearing muŋgot or rɨptɨke in the context of a story would have little dif-
ficulty understanding it. Other verbs that undergo both stem changes and less
common inflectional forms, like ambuku ‘hide’, present greater challenges to
comprehension.
     Example (6-43) above with ambuku ‘hide’ illustrates another feature of how
young speakers inflect intransitive verbs. Just as these speakers show a strong
tendency to collapse all classes of transitive verbs and inflect them as though they
were class 5 verbs, so do they tend, when they inflect intransitive verbs, to treat
them all as though they belonged to group I (see Section 6.2.1).
     So an irregular verb like takɨ ‘sleep’ will be realized as tatet ‘you (m) slept’
instead of the correct tat, and a verb with a regular but non-transparent inflec-
tional pattern like the one above, ombiek ‘she hid’, will be regularized to ambtak.
     Group I intransitive verbs take subject endings that are the most common
ones for intransitive verbs. Three characteristics of the subject endings in
this group make them particularly salient for young speakers. The first is that
they are, precisely, the most common subject endings that affix to intransitive
verbs.
     The second reason for their salience is the fact that they are identical in
form to the subject endings that affix to verbs in the future tense. So compare the
following:
Pronoun         Subject endings for group I    Subject endings for all verbs (both
                intransitive verbs in realis   intransitive and transitive) inflected

198            6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsPronoun            Subject endings for group I         Subject endings for all verbs (both
                   intransitive verbs in realis        intransitive and transitive) inflected
                                                       in irrealis (see Table 5.2 and 5.3)ŋgu ‘she’          -tak                                -tak
ŋɨ ‘he’            -net                                -net
yim ‘we’           -nak                                -nak
yum ‘you pl’       -nkem                               -nkem
ŋgɨ ‘they’         -tuko                               -tuko/-ndak
dl                 -tike                               -tike/-nkemThat these endings occur so frequently in Tayap makes them readily available for
young speakers to access when they are trying to conjugate a verb with the correct
subject ending.
     The third reason why the subject endings listed above are particularly salient
for young speakers is because several of the forms are also identical to the imper-
ative endings of intransitive verbs – even those verbs that have other subject
endings in the realis.
     So in the imperative mood, even a verb as irregular as okɨ ‘go’ takes a regular
ending and becomes o-tet (‘go.sbj-2sg.m.r’) or o-tak (‘go.sbj-2sg.f.r’) or o-nkem
(‘go.sbj-2pl.r’).
     Following this pattern, the imperative command telling a female to hide is
amb-tak (from the verb root ambuku). This is exactly the form that the speaker
who wanted to say ‘she hid’ produced in a narrative. The form is incorrect, but the
reason she chose it, and not some other form, is clear.
     Intransitive verbs of motion present special problems for young speakers
of Tayap. A language like English uses a wide range of prepositions to encode
various kinds of motion. So English speakers say ‘go up’, ‘go down’, ‘go across’,
‘go around’, ‘go first’, ‘go inside’ and so on. Tayap has separate verbs for all of
those motions (and many more): wurkɨ ‘go up in a direction’, wuwku ‘ascend’, aski
‘go down in a direction’, sirki ‘descend’, utak-(p)-oski ‘go across’, rɨpɨkɨ ‘go first’,
arkɨ ‘go inside’. All those verbs either change their stem form – often dramati-
cally – in the realis status and/or they have irregular and unpredictable inflec-
tions. An example is the common verb ‘go’, which has a stem form of okɨ in the
irrealis, but which in the realis becomes mbot ‘he goes’ (or ‘I (m) go’ or ‘you (m)
go’), wok ‘she goes’, ŋgwok ‘they go’, etc.
     The unpredictability and irregularity of verbs of motion has resulted in their
becoming relatively scarce in the speech of speakers under thirty. The weakest
speakers get by with just two verbs of motion: okɨ ‘go’ and aiki ‘come’. The nature
of speakers’ narratives sometimes forces them to attempt other verbs, like sirki
‘descend’ (if the narrator has someone up a tree) or arkɨ ‘go inside’ (if the narrator
                                               Intransitive verbs in the realis   199
is talking about going inside a particular area of rainforest where a pig has been
speared or a venomous snake spotted). But young speakers’ attempts to inflect
those verbs are often either not correct or are arrived at only after discussion with
friends.
     Even the common verbs ‘go’ and ‘come’ present many young speakers with
problems as soon as they have to inflect the verb for a person other than the sin-
gular ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘he’, ‘she’ or ‘we’ (whose subject ending is always the same as the
1sg.f ending). The inflections for 2pl, 3pl and dual – all of which are quite differ-
ent from the other subject endings – tend to be avoided, and when they do occur
they tend to be either wrong or the result of much back-and-forth negotiation
among the narrator and his or her friends.
     The dual form, in particular, seems moribund. It should have occurred in
many of the narratives I collected, because many young people talked about how
they did something in the rainforest or the mangrove swamp together with one
close friend. The overwhelming tendency in those narratives, though, was to use
the 1pl ‘we’ form of the verb instead of the dual – so speakers said yim mbok ‘we
went’ or yim kuk ‘we were’, when what they wanted was yim woke ‘we two went’
and yim wuke ‘we two were’.
     A final strong tendency in regards to intransitive verbs is phonological.
Young speakers frequently reduce the number of vowels that occur in a verb.
Particularly vulnerable is word medial ɨ, which often gets eliminated, and the
vowel cluster ie, which often gets reduced to e. So for example a verb with a vowel
cluster like tewtiek ‘she ran away’ becomes tewtek or tetwek. Priek ‘she went
down’ becomes prek, and so on.
     This is a phonological process that probably has been going on in Tayap for
some time. In the 1980s, I recorded senior men who consistently said things like
katɨtɨtet ‘he fell’. In other words, their versions of these verbs had more word-
medial vowels than are present in the speech of even the oldest speakers today.
What seems to have happened in Tayap is that medial syllables have undergone
a steady process of reduction.(6-44) ‘he fell’ katɨtɨtet    → katɨtet       → katet

7 MoodMood is the name given to the ways a language grammatically encodes a speaker’s
attitude toward an utterance. How does a speaker issue a command or express a
wish? Voice a doubt or assert a fact? English accomplishes many of these kinds of
speech acts with modal verbs like ‘can’, ‘will’ and ‘must’. Tayap expresses them
with particular kinds of verbal morphology. The declarative or indicative mood
(i.e. making a statement) has been presented this grammar. It is not morphologi-
cally marked in Tayap. The interrogative mood is expressed with the interrogative
clitic =ke, discussed in Section 3.9.
      Other moods that are indicated through particular morphology on a verb are
as follows:
– Subjunctive (including imperative, jussive, indirect commands and wishes)
      (Section 7.1)
– Prohibitive (Section 7.2)
– Admonitive (Section 7.3)
– Intentional (Section 7.4)
– Benefactive (Section 7.5)Other free-form mood particles are also discussed (Section 7.6).
    Note that the realis/irrealis distinction which is fundamental to so much of
Tayap’s verbal morphology is considered in this work to be a status distinction
rather than a mood distinction, and as such is discussed in Chapters 5 and 6
rather than here. Note also that the realis/irrealis distinction is not available to
non-indicative moods apart from the benefactive.","[212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220]"

3.4.1 Common adverbsTayap has a small closed set of common adverbs that specify the way in which the
action expressed by the verb is carried out. The full set is as follows:ainɨ           ‘like this’            ndagunɨ            ‘furtively’, ‘without

construction.
     Like adjectives, common adverbs can function as verbs (Section 3.3.2). So just
as it is possible to inflect an adjective to say something like ‘it will be bad’,(3-54) aprorkɨtak
       apro -r- -kɨ        -tak
       bad -r- -irr -2sg.f|3sg.f.irr
       ‘it will get bad’ (The r after apro here and after supwáspwa in the next
       example is phonologically motivated; see Section 2.6.)Adverbs can also be inflected to produce sentences like the following:(3-55) a. supwáspwarkɨtak
          supwáspwa -r- -kɨ      -tak
          badly          -r- -irr -2sg.f|3sg.f.irr

          ‘it became the real thing’In addition to modifying verbs, adverbs can also modify noun phrases, as in the
following, in which ŋayor ‘really’ modifies the possessive NP ‘illness’:(3-56) kandawŋan munje ŋayor
       kandaw =ŋan munje ŋayor
       illness =poss man     really
       ‘a really sick man’

3.4.2 Adverbial functions of the suffix -kɨThe affix -kɨ (rarely -nɨ) has multiple functions. It is one of the three irrealis affixes
for intransitive verbs (see Section 5.4.2). It is also an intensifier (see Section 3.11).
In addition, it expresses adverbial meanings when it is affixed to the following
components:
(1) -kɨ can be affixed to nouns to express a distributive meaning; that is, that an
action or event takes place on more than one individual occasion, involves an
undetermined variety of the same kind of referents, or denotes the way in which
something is distributed. These are usually reduplicated:(3-57) a. orom -kɨ     orom -kɨ

express when an event occurred or will occur:
                                                                              Adverbs     77
General temporals:      anombi          ‘later on in the near future’
                        nunuk           ‘later’, ‘afterwards’
                        nirere          ‘a moment ago’, ‘in a minute’
                        rɨpam           ‘a long time previously’, ‘in the olden days’
                        rɨpɨm           ‘before’, ‘previously’
                        rɨpɨmkɨ         ‘quite a while ago’
                        rɨpɨmbarakɨ     ‘a fair while ago’ (not as long ago as rɨpɨmkɨ)Divisions of the day:   embeb           ‘just before dawn’ (4.30–5.30)
                        emb             ‘morning’ (5.30–7.00)
                        arawer          ‘daytime, early afternoon’ (7.00–16.00)
                        ŋgrag arawer    ‘late afternoon’ (16.00–17.00)
                        ŋgrag           ‘early evening’ (17.00–19.00)
                        ikur            ‘night’ (19.00–4.30)
The locative clitic =re can be used in its temporal function with these words to
specify the time of an action:(3-60) a. ikurre yim okɨtike
          ikur    =re      yim o           -kɨ -tike
          night =temp 1pl go.irr -irr -dl.irr

            morning =temp intens go.3pl.r -perf rainforest =all
            ‘they went into the jungle at the break of dawn’=re also carries the adverbial meaning of frequency when the temporal phrase it
creates is repeated. See below, Section 3.4.4.
    Calendrical time has the following nominal expressions:
     aro                    ‘day’
     arawer                 ‘day’, lit. ‘sun’
     karep                  ‘month’, lit. ‘moon’
     ŋgudumŋa kɨt/          ‘year’, lit. ‘Pleiades’
     mbiruŋa kɨt
=re is also attached to these words to specify the time of an action:

         ‘next month I’m going to go hit him’Duration over time – ‘for three days’ and similar – is expressed by adding an
intransitive verb ending, inflected for 3sg.f, to the number:(3-62)   ŋgɨ turkar ŋgwoka arawer senetak
         ŋgɨ tur                -kar    ŋgwok -a arawer sene-tak

         ‘they sang and danced for two days’Days in relation to one another are expressed as:     muŋgit    ‘the day before yesterday’ (used generally to mean ‘recently’, ‘in
               the recent past’)
     ewar      ‘yesterday’
     ene       ‘today’, ‘now’
     epi       ‘tomorrow’
     tuemb     ‘the day after tomorrow’
     amen      ‘3 days hence’
     amamar    ‘4 days hence’
     amandukup ‘5 days hence’
     ndukup    ‘6 days hence’
     aŋgisakup ‘7 days hence’The above temporals differ from the others listed so far in that unlike them, the
words for days in relation to one another are never modified by the postposed
temporal -re.
    Some examples of use are:(3-63)   a. muŋgit yim priekŋan ŋgɨ Ŋgasimbara patɨrnɨ ŋguk
            muŋgit yim priek                    =ŋan, ŋgɨ Ŋgasimbara

              ‘last night I went to hunt (lit. ‘to look for’) bandicoot’
Speakers younger than about forty know the words in the above list of days up to
and including tuemb ‘the day after tomorrow’. Some know, but never use, amen
(three days from now). The words for four and five days in the future are known
only by speakers over fifty. I recorded aŋgisakup (seven days from now) during
elicitation sessions with old fluent speakers in the 1980s. Nowadays the word is
obsolete, remembered by only a few of the oldest speakers in the village.","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"
"This speaker’s use of the clause subordinating morpheme -re (Section 9.4.1) is
morphologically correct – that is, it is placed correctly after the main verb in a
clause that thus becomes marked as subordinate. But it is semantically awkward.
A more fluent speaker would tell the story using the coordinating morpheme -a
(Section 9.3.1) in all instances where this speaker uses the subordinating mor-
pheme. This particular speaker uses -re more than all other young speakers
combined. It seems that she has identified the morpheme as a synonym for the
coordinating suffix -a.
     Three other kinds of clause linkage appear in young people’s narratives. The
first is the use of the perfect suffix to coordinate clauses, discussed in Section
5.4.3.2.
     The second is linkage accomplished with the word ‘okay’, which has become
part of Tok Pisin (as “oke”) via English.
     Here is an example from the narrative of a twenty-one-year-old man telling a
story about buying alcohol:(9-55) piatana ŋa mbot ŋgɨrekɨ oke Jastinŋi botol nambar mosenkun oke Simbɨraŋi
       non mosenkun oke ŋa ŋaŋan nambar kukumbota ŋgɨrekɨ akruna

       go.sg.m.r.s- -and 3pl =com consume.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -intent
       ‘…he gave me and I went with them, OK Jastin bought one bottle, OK
       Sɨmbɨra bought one, OK I took mine and went with them to drink…’
288        9 Simple and complex sentencesNote that ‘okay’ here performs the role of both -a (which this speaker uses profi-
ciently, as can be seen in lines 1 and 4 of this extract) and the clause coordinating
suffix -api, which links clauses that encode actions that occur one after the other
(Section 9.3.2).
     The third way young villagers sometimes link clauses is with the Tayap word
mai, which means ‘enough’, and the discourse marker nda. For many young
speakers, these two words have replaced the -api suffix as a way of indicating
that one action was completed before the next action began.
     This usage can be exemplified with an extract from a narrative told by a
nineteen-year-old woman:(9-56) …ŋayi wakuna wakuna mai, nda sowor ninkun. Sowor nitukuna mai,
       amayi mum nitukuna nda yim kakun uretrekɨ.

       ‘…I grated the coconut and, I grated it and enough, I made a boiling. She
       made a boiling, enough, then mama made sago jelly then we ate it with
       bamboo shoots’There are several grammatical errors in this short extract: the class 2 transitive
verb war ‘grate’ is inflected in a way typical of young speakers (see Section 6.1.3).
The expression sowor ninkun doesn’t exist – the speaker wants a verb, sowor-
pokun (‘I boiled a little’, from the verb root sowor-(p)-o ‘boil a small amount’).
And the speaker produces two different inflections for her *sowor construction:
                                   Complex sentences in young people’s Tayap      289
‘I did it’ (ninkun) and ‘she did it’ (nitukun), so it is never clear exactly who boiled
the small amount of bamboo shoots she talks about.
     As far as syntax is concerned, note how the speaker uses mai (‘enough’) to
express the completion of one action before the following action begins, and how
the discourse marker nda marks the beginning of the following action. This is
precisely the kind of clause coordination done by the Tayap suffix -api, and in
the speech of a fluent speaker, the young woman’s sentence would look like this:(9-57) ŋayi pap parkunapi, uret soworpokun
       ŋa =yi        pap       par     -ku                 -n          -api,

        bamboo_shoot boil_small_amount.r -3sg.f.r.o                 -sg|1pl.r.s
        ‘I grated the coconut, after I had grated it, I boiled a little bamboo shoots’That the utterance that this young woman actually produces in (9-56) is so far
removed from correct Tayap – in terms of vocabulary, verb inflection and mor-
phology – is sobering.
    It is a chill reminder that a tenacious and unique little language spoken by
very few people for a very long time is now on its way to oblivion.
Tayap TextsTayap Text 1: Two men are chased by their lover’s ghost
Narrated by Raya Ayarpa in 1987English translationI am going to tell the story of the old ancestors of Mbwadum. Once upon a
time (lit. before, in the old days) two men went to the Turuŋgwad clan. Kanjaŋ
village. For mangrove slugs. They were going to go and they went to their
lover and asked her: “Are you OK? We’re going to go for mangrove slugs at the
Turuŋgwad clan”.
     She told them, “The two of you go. I’m not a baby bird who is going to swallow

     Hearing her talk, they went. With their best dog, they went to the Turuŋgwad
clan. In Kanjaŋ village. Thus they went and the people of the Turuŋgwad clan
gave them gifts. They gave them the gift of two sticks of dried slug meat and they
sent them on their way and the two of them came back up [home].
     The two came up and went and came up to the Kirmar grassland.
     The woman too had died and her ghost went there. She went they came up.
They came up toward the grassland. They came up toward the Krimar grassland
and she asked them, “So the two of you come now, do you?”
     The two answered, “Yes”. They asked her, “Where are you going?”
     “I have children who are crying, so I’m going to Kandumsik stream to try and
net some fish”.
     “OK. You go on then, in that case”.
     She passed by them and put down her things, turned and cleared her throat
and said, “Who are you? Are you my lovers? It’s me”.
     They threw down their two sticks of slugs and then she chased them. She
chased them and brought them [towards the village]. She chased them and
brought them.
     The dog stood and was fighting with the spirit woman while the two ances-
tors picked up speed and came. The dog was fighting, fighting, fighting with the
spirit woman. Leaving her, he then came to the two ancestors. He came, came,
came, came, came, he came down to them.
     The spirit woman came close to them and he [the dog] stood and fought. He

the bottom of Mbwadum mountain. They came up along the mountain.
    Children were below playing on the slope, they were shooting arrows at little
coconuts. They were shooting arrows at little coconuts when the two men came
up to them. They told them: “Call out to us!”. The children called out to them: “O!
O! O! O! O! O!”
    They [the men] fell and rolled down and died, their two bodies lay there
below. Their dog died together with them.
    The spirit woman, she had brought them thusly and she stood there and then
she turned and left them.
    Leaving them, she went away. The two men were laying there and they [other
men], thinking this must have something to do with ghosts, got a branch and spit
magic chants on it and as they were trying to bring them back, the two men got up.
    The others asked them: “What did this to you?”
     “The ghost, our girlfriend, chased us and came and her heat [i.e. her power]
affected us and so we died”.
     “OK”, said the others, “Come on then [back to the village]”.","[307, 308, 309, 310, 311]"

9.3.2 Coordination with -api ‘afterward’ (aft)The suffix -api links clauses that encode actions that occur consecutively, one
after the other. It is affixed to a verb that is fully inflected for person, number and
TAM and takes its own arguments. The suffix marks that verb as an action that
was or will be completed before the action in the clause that follows it occurred
or will occur.
    Like -a, -api can link clauses that involve either the same subject or different
subjects. Again, it joins full independent clauses.
    Examples are:(9-12) a. ŋa tuwkunetapi aikinet yure
          ŋa tuw         -ku -net            -api
          1sg wash.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr -aft            ai           -ki    -net                 yu =re

           ‘after they fought, the moon rose’9.3.3 Coordination with ŋgɨ(na)napi ‘therefore’, ‘for that reason’Some speakers pronounce this form ŋgu(na)napi, which indicates that it might be
analyzed as ŋgu (3sg.f)+ the coordinating suffix -api. So: ‘after it’.
    Ŋgɨnanapi (or ŋgɨnapi) is a freestanding word. It introduces a clause that
expresses cause or reason, thereby combining two main clauses:(9-13) a. ŋgɨgi Kama ŋgarkwanŋguk ŋgarkwanŋguk, ŋgɨnapi ŋgu wek
          ŋgɨ =gi        Kama ŋgar         -kwan         -ŋguk

            ‘Yesterday a sore appeared [on his leg] and therefore he didn’t walk’9.3.4 Coordination with ayáta ‘although’, ‘it doesn’t matter that’, ‘never
      mind that’Ayáta is a word most familiar to the villagers as an interjection of impatience or
dismissal, in its meaning of ‘Stop it! or ‘Never mind’ (see Section 3.10). It is this
latter sense of dismissal that is expressed when the word is used in a sentence as
a clause-coordinating conjunction.(9-14) a. ayáta ŋɨ munje suman, nime ŋa namŋgarke
          ayáta       ŋɨ       munje suman nime         ŋa nam           -garke

scope covers both ‘go’ and ‘see’ verbs, which are both in their negative stripped
down form.        b. ayáta ŋɨ aikinana waraknet, ŋa wákare inda okɨ rarŋrɨ

            ‘Even though they didn’t come, we’ll make food’Sentences with ayáta can also occur in construction with the verb in the clause
that follows ayáta in the prohibitive mood. For example:(9-15) a. ayáta tukur aiŋgarke, yim okɨtikenana

            ‘Even if night comes quickly, they’re going to come’9.4 Adverbial subordinate clauses9.4.1 Adverbial subordination with -re ‘when’, ‘if’, ‘while’ (sub)The suffix -re (realized as -de after n) attaches as a suffix to fully inflected verbs
and marks a verb as expressing the background condition in relation to which the
action indicated in the main clause occurs. This backgrounding nature of sub-
ordination is emphasized by the order of the subordinate and main clauses in
Tayap: the subordinate clause always precedes the main clause.
     In English, these are clauses that would be expressed with the subordinating
conjunctions ‘if’ and ‘when’. Unlike English, though, Tayap makes no distinc-
tion between ‘if’ and ‘when’, at least when referring to unreal events; both are
expressed by -re.
     These clauses are semantically subordinate in that they specify a precondi-
tion for the action of the main clause to occur. They are not considered medial-
final (cosubordinate) constructions, as the non-final verbs are structurally quite
different, for instance they are not obligatorily irrealis (Section 9.8).

           shame.r-sg.m.r
           ‘when he said that bad thing to me, I (m) became ashamed’When verbs in both subordinate and main clauses are constructed in the progres-
sive (see Section 8.3.1) the meaning of -re is ‘while’ and the actions indicated by
the verbs occur simultaneously, not sequentially.(9-17) a. ŋa prukakkutre, ŋɨ pororakut

            ‘the cassowary was drinking water when I (m or f) speared him’Negative conditionals occur paratactically without -re, perhaps because the
negation word wákare already ends in re:(9-18) yu ŋaŋan nam tariati wákare, ŋayi yu adrunet
       yu ŋaŋan       nam tar             -iati      wákare

        ‘If you (m or f) don’t listen to my talk, I (m) am going to hit you’9.4.2 Adverbial subordination with the hypothetical particles pi, pime,
      ndɨ (hypo)Counterfactual events are expressed by a main clause (‘I would have killed the
snake’) and a subordinate clause (‘if I had seen it in time’). As discussed in the fol-
lowing section, Section 9.4.3, counterfactual constructions, in addition to being
formed with a particular inflectional morphology, also obligatorily take a particle
that can be glossed as ‘hypothetical’.
    This particle, which can be either pi, pime or ndɨ marks the clause in which it
appears as the subordinate clause. These particles all have their own stress.
    Like the previous clauses, these clauses are semantically subordinate.
    For example:(9-19) a. pipiŋgabu aŋgwar pime, oŋgab wawarwekrɨknukun
          pipiŋgabu a        -ŋgwar pime, oŋgab

             ‘If he hadn’t gotten a pain, he would have worked sago’Unlike the clause-linking constituents -a, -api and -re, the hypothetical particles
pi, pime and ndɨ are not bound morphemes. They are free morphemes that tend to
be clause final, as the following examples show:(9-20) a. Mbanuŋ ewar awknet pi, wakŋgɨn

              ‘If you were young, I would marry you’When appearing with a verb inflected in the intentional mood (see Sections 5.4.2.3
and Section 7.4), pi (or ndɨ, which is also sometimes used in this context) means ‘If
X want(s) to do Y…’. For example:(9-21) a. Kiki Potowre atɨkɨnana pi, namku wetak
          Kiki Potow       =re      atɨ                   -kɨ     -nana       pi

            sago jelly’Ndɨ behaves slightly differently to pi and pime. Ndɨ is also a discourse marker
that highlights the noun phrase that it follows in ongoing talk (see Section 3.11.2).
However, when it occurs in a clause with a verb inflected in counterfactual mood,
ndɨ conveys a hypothetical meaning.
    Ndɨ is also the particle that usually follows the negation wákare in a negative
counterfactual sentence, for example:(9-23) ewar tukur aiki wákare ndɨ yim patɨr andɨkrɨkkun
       ewar       tukur ai             -ki   wákare ndɨ

did not or cannot happen, as in ‘If he had gone hunting yesterday, he would have
speared a cassowary’, or ‘If you had been young, I would marry you’. Some of
the ways of constructing the counterfactual have become moribund in Tayap.
There are a number of morphologically rather complex subtypes. The counterfac-
tual has the largest degree of variation documented for any verb form in Tayap.
Already in the 1980s, I was told by senior men that a clause like ‘would have
gone’ could be expressed as wakret, waknet, wakrɨknet or wakrɨkret, and that all
of those verbs meant exactly the same thing.
     By 2009, the oldest fluent speakers were constructing counterfactual sen-
tences differently from what I had recorded in the 1980s. Those oldest speakers
                                                       Adverbial subordinate clauses     263
were still able to produce counterfactual morphology, but they only inflected
one of the verbs in a counterfactual construction consisting of two clauses. Most
speakers under fifty, however, could not do even this. Those speakers constructed
counterfactual sentences without using any counterfactual morphology.
    And even relatively fluent Tayap speakers younger than forty have stopped
using Tayap in the main clause of a counterfactual construction.
    Senior men in the 1980s expressed the counterfactual as follows:             if-clause                                            then-clause

          pi, pime or ndɨ
Example:(9-24) njenum Mbowdirekɨ muŋgit wakndak pi, ŋgɨ ŋgat non wakŋgro
       njenum Mbowdi =rekɨ muŋgit wak1            -ndak      pi,

         ‘If the dogs had gone with Mbowdi the other day, they would have speared
         a cassowary’By 2009, the oldest fluent speakers were expressing counterfactuality by nominal-

       ‘Mairum hypothetically a giver of a tobacco seedling, I would have planted it’)Counterfactual morphology is still used in the example above, but unlike the
senior men in the 1980s, the oldest speakers of Tayap in 2009 only used it for the
verb of the then-clause. In this case, the counterfactual meaning of the if-clause
is borne by the hypothetical particle pi, pime or ndɨ, not by verb morphology.
Constructing a counterfactual sentence like this was a possibility earlier, and I
have a few recorded examples of this form from the 1980s. But they are rare. The
overwhelming majority of the examples I recorded in the 1980s inflected the verbs
in both the if-clause and the then-clause with the counterfactual morphology.
    Counterfactual morphology is completely absent in the language of fluent
speakers between the ages of forty and fifty-five in 2009. They consistently
express counterfactuality without using any counterfactual morphology at all:                 if-clause                                  then-clause

On the few occasions when these speakers formulate a counterfactual statement,
the entire then-clause is in Tok Pisin, not Tayap:               if-clause                                   then-clause

some time. That, at any rate, may be one explanation for the fact that already in
the 1980s it exhibited the widest variation of any verbal morphology.
     Another explanation could be that the various forms, even if they had the
same literal meaning, had different stylistic nuances. If so, those nuances had
already been lost even in the speech of senior men in the 1980s.","[276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285]"
"Complex predicates and non-final verb objectsThe dictionary also lists forms frequently occurring in complex predicates. These
consist of cosubordinate verbs suffixed occuring with either -ra (‘modifier’) or
-kar (‘manner’), and often followed by a verb of motion (see Section 9.8). The verb
of motion that follows these verbs in the dictionary entry is either okɨ ‘go’ or aiki
‘come’, depending on which one would most be most common in village speech.
However, these verbs of motion can be substituted by any other.
     Several entries are for commonly-occurring serial verbs constructed with
non-final object suffixes. Those suffixes change for the object of the verb; it is there-
fore not possible to write them in non-specified form. In those cases, the capital ‘X’
indicates that the morphological slot represented by X must be filled with an object
suffix – unless otherwise specified, this will be a non-final object suffix.
     An example is the entry for the following verb, which means ‘humiliate’,
‘embarrass’, ‘defeat’:
342         Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionary      tɨmbraXokɨ v.i. irr. (serial verb construction conjugated like okɨ, Note: the X
      is a non-final object suffix).","[361, 362]"
"Foreign words in TayapSeveral commonly used nouns, adjectives and verbs stems have been incor-
porated into Tayap from two nearby vernaculars, which are called Kopar and
Adjora in the linguistic literature. The Kopar language is spoken in three villages:
in neighboring Wongan and in the Sepik river villages of Kopar and Singrin.
350          Tayap-English-Tok Pisin DictionaryToday, the language is in bad shape and is disappearing even more quickly than
Tayap. Young men and women in their twenties seem not even to understand
much Kopar, let alone speak it. But it is still spoken by adults, though, especially
women over forty.
     Adjora, in contrast, is a much more robust language. This is partly undoubt-
edly due to the fact that the population of Adjora-speaking villages is large.
Already in the 1970s, Adjora had about 2,347 speakers, according to Laycock and
Z’graggen (1975:739). This population has no doubt grown exponentially since
then.1 In addition to sheer numbers, the persistence of the Adjora language is
also surely linked to the fact that the people of Adjora-speaking villages, such
as the nearby Sanae, consciously and proudly maintain key components of their
traditional culture, such as parts of the men’s house cult and many of the prac-
tices relating to mortuary rituals. (Partly for this reason, the villagers of Gapun
regard Adjora-speaking villages as the source of all sorcery and the cause of
every death in Gapun). While my informal observations indicate that Adjora
may be losing ground among young people in Sanae village, and perhaps also
in the villages of Tarengi and Wunkenan, the language is still spoken by prob-
ably several thousand people in villages to the east of Gapun extending to the
Ramu river.
     It was not always clear which words in Tayap are of foreign origin because (a)
the words are fully integrated into the Tayap grammar, so foreign verb roots, for
instance, are with few exceptions declined as class 5 Tayap verbs, and (b) speak-
ers under sixty tended not to be aware that a particular word was not of Tayap
origin. I know that a certain word is of foreign origin only because either its pho-
netic shape struck me as unusual and I specifically queried people about it (one
of the words for mushroom, oŋgɨsu, is an example), or because an older villager
brought it to my attention (an example is the verb for being jealous, mwanambri).","[369, 370]"
"3.1.1.3 Number marking in nouns
The overwhelming majority of nouns in Tayap have only one form. Plurality is
expressed through the addition of quantifiers (see Section 3.6). However, there is
52         3 Word classesa closed subclass of nouns that inflect for plurality and, in a few cases, duality, by
suffix and/or partial suppletion.
     Nouns that are inflected for number refer to higher animates: humans, pigs
and dogs.","[71, 72]"

6.1.8 Class 4 and 5 verbs in young people’s TayapThe tendency for young speakers to collapse all of Tayap’s verb classes into class 5
verbs has already been mentioned several times. The reason for this tendency is
simple: the stems of class 5 verbs always remain the same. There is no stem alter-
nation between the realis and the irrealis – no p insertion, no ka/o alternation,
no changes at all.
      Class 4 verbs, of course, do undergo stem change between realis and irrea-
lis; indeed, this alternation is what distinguishes them from class 5 verbs. Young
people have a difficult time with those changes, and they predictably deal with
them by simply ignoring them.
      In other words, the t/r alternation is overlooked and verbs in the non-future
tense are inflected using their irrealis stem forms. This renders verbs like the
following:(6-35)    a. *ru              -nu -ku         -n
             sharpen.irr      -s  <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
             ‘I sharpened it’instead of          b. tu               -nu -ku         -n
             sharpen.irr      -s- <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s

             stand.irr      -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
             ‘she stood it up’instead of          d. mba          -tu -ku     -n
             stand.irr -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
             ‘she stood it up’              verb root mbar (class 4)
                                                     Transitive verb classes     189
When young speakers inflect class 4 and class 5 verbs, they sometimes omit the
first part of the discontinuous subject morpheme (that is, the -nV- or -tV- segment
of the verb) and they produce verbs like the following:(6-36) a. *nam -gɨ                 -n
          talk.r -3sg.m.r.o        -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘I told him’instead of          b.    nam      -nɨ -ŋgɨ       -n
                talk.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
               ‘I told him’
                verb root nam (class 5)More commonly, though, speakers retain the form of the discontinuous subject
marking. But the weakest speakers collapse the distinction between -nV (1sg, 1pl,
2pl, 3sg.m) and -tV (2sg, 3sg.f, 3pl, dl) in one of two ways:(1)   they replace both -nV and -tV with -pV.
    So namtukun, which means ‘You/she told her’, and namnukun ‘I/he/we told
her’ both become nampukun;or else(2)   they collapse the distinction between -nV and -tV such that -nV disappears
      completely and all forms take -tV.
     So namnukun becomes namtukun. This is what the young speaker quoted in
example (6-25) does – he uses a -tV form when what is wanted is a -nV form.
     The reason for this it that the imperative verb forms that are most often
addressed to children and young people – and to which they need to pay atten-
tion if they are not to be chastised, threatened or hit by the older person telling
them to do something – are forms that contain -tV. So children and young people
will hear older speakers telling them yu namtukun (‘you tell her!’) or yu ŋgritukun
(‘you put it!’).
     When young speakers struggle to inflect a verb, this imperative form often
ends up being the one they produce. It is as though they wrack their brains for
the proper form, and come up with the form by which they are addressed. The
problem, of course, is that that form denotes particular subjects, and ‘I’ is not one
of them.
190        6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbs6.2 Intransitive verbs in the realisIntransitive verbs in the realis status display many of the same kinds of stem
changes as characterize transitive verbs. For example, some verb stems alter-
nate between p and Ø, like class 1 transitive verbs, between p and w, like class 2
transitive verbs, between a and ka or o, like class 3 transitive verbs, or between t
and r, like class 4 transitive verbs.
    Other alternations exist only for intransitive verbs – for example an alterna-
tion between m in the irrealis and p in the realis, as in memkɨnet → pemiet (‘I will
get up’ → ‘I got up’).
    As is the case with transitive verbs, none of these variations are predictable,
and there are many verbs, especially verbs of motion, that are irregular. In these
verbs, stem changes between irrealis and realis do not adhere to any of the con-
ventions discussed above.
    Intransitive verbs in Tayap do not group into distinct conjugation classes as
neatly as transitive verbs do. Recall that transitive verbs, whatever changes their
verb stems may undergo, all take the same object morphemes. Their subject mor-
phemes also remain largely the same; the only difference being that class 4 and
5 verbs take discontinuous subject morphemes. But even those discontinuous
subject morphemes have regular and predictable forms.
    Intransitive verbs are different. There is little or no patterned correspond-
ence between how a verb stem alters between irrealis and realis – say, for
example the m/p alternation just mentioned – and the subject endings taken
by that verb. Compare, for example, the following two verbs, ‘get up’ and
‘stand’:         future
(6-37)   a. memkɨnet
            mem           -kɨ    -net
            get_up.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr
            ‘I (m) will get up’ or ‘he will get up’         non-future
         b. pemiet
            pem         -iet
            get_up.r -sg.m.r
            ‘I (m) got up’, ‘he got up’ ‘you (m) got up’

       future

          ‘I (m) will stand up’ or ‘he will stand up’         non-future
         b. puŋgot
            puŋg          -ot
            stand_up.r -sg.m.r
            ‘I (m) stood up’, ‘he stood up’, ‘you (m) stood up’Notice that even though both of these verb stems alternate between m in irrealis
and p in the realis, their final subject endings in the non-future are different from
one another: -iet in one case and -ot in the other. This lack of patterned relation
between stem alternation and subject endings is the reason intransitive verbs are
not classified here into “conjugation classes”.
     Instead, they are labeled with the looser term “conjugation groups” and iden-
tified here and in the dictionary by the variation in endings that they exhibit in
the 1sg masculine and feminine.","[206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211]"
"(2) The forms in the parentheses following the entry are the verb’s realis forms.
    If the forms are regular, only a few will be listed, in order to allow a reader
    to identify them by looking at Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of the Grammar. In the
    case of ‘laugh’, a glance at Section 6.2.1 reveals that the endings -ot and -ok
    indicate that ‘laugh’ is a Group IV intransitive verb, and that pirot means ‘I
    (m) laughed’, ‘you (m) laughed’, or ‘he laughed’; pirok means ‘I (f) laughed’,
    ‘you (f) laughed’, ‘she laughed’ or ’we laughed’. The forms that verbs that
    belong to this Group take for all other persons are found in that Section.",[360]
"These tendencies are discussed in the appropriate sections of the grammar and in
the commentaries to the Tayap texts (page 289ff).
22        1 The Tayap language and its speakers1.5 Naming practicesEveryone in Gapun has a numŋa nomb ‘village name’, which is one of a closed
class of names that are recycled every third or fourth generation. When the
person who bore the name most recently has died, it becomes available for reuse.
All personal names are the property of one of the five different clans to which
all Gapuners belong – crocodile (orem), dog (nje), parrot (karar), pig (mbor) or
flying fox (njakep). This means that a name expresses clan membership, which
is a crucial and central facet of villagers’ identity, since it regulates access to
land rights (different clans have rights to different areas of land) and marriage
possibilities (clans are exogamous, so one’s spouse should not be a fellow clan
member).
     Because names signify clan membership, a person cannot give a child a
name that belongs to another clan. Such an act would be a kind of theft and
would result, villagers are agreed, in the ensorcellment and death of the child, of
the person who named the child or of a matrilineal relative of those persons (see
Kulick 1992: 98–99 for a fuller discussion).
      A child’s parents have little say in what their child will be called. When a
baby is born and has survived a few days, one of the baby’s relatives (normally
a matrilineal relative such as the baby’s mother’s mother, the mother’s uncle or
one of her siblings) will let it be known that they are going to ‘put a name’ (nomb
ŋgur) on the child. In due course – several weeks to a month after the child’s
birth – the self-appointed bestower of the name will let it be known what the
child will be called. If the mother or father doesn’t like the sound of the name that
the relative has come up with, they can reject it and ask her or him to think of a
better one. Or they can ask another relative to put another name on the child, so
that the child has two competing names.
     This occasionally happens even if both a child’s parents are satisfied with the
name that has given to their new baby: sometimes that name is a taboo name for
one of the parents – it may be the name of a deceased in-law, for example, and the
names of in-laws are forbidden for villagers to call, even after the in-law bearing
the name has died. In a case like that, the parent who is unable to call her or his
child by name will either solicit a second name, or else she or he will address the
child by a nickname, which will often be a word that draws attention to a defect
or disability.
     Villagers do not hide or try to disguise people’s physical or intellectual differ-
ences from others; on the contrary, they continually foreground such differences
with names like Ŋgino (Tayap ‘Eye’; the nickname of a woman with strabismus);
Kela (Tok Pisin ‘Baldy’, the nickname of a child who fell into a fire at a young age
and was left with a large scar, from which hair cannot grow, covering most of his

head); or Sens (Tok Pisin ‘Crazy’, the nickname of a young man who is probably
epileptic and who sometimes blanks out of an interaction for several minutes at a
time).
    Village names are anywhere from one to four syllables, with the majority
consisting of two syllables. Some examples are:

Pisin, no word in Tayap). In contrast to village names, a person’s Christian name
is chosen by his or her parents or by a matrilineal relative whom the parents think
can come up with a better name than they can. They choose a name either that
they have heard someone from another village being called, or that they have
decided is a name from the Bible.
     Following the pattern of their traditional naming practices, villagers avoid
giving their child the same name that somebody else already has, so there is
usually only one Maria, one Joseph, one Paul, etc. in Gapun at any one time.
     A child’s Christian name is thought up whenever the Catholic priest from the
Marienberg mission station comes to the village to baptize children – an event
that occurs about once every two or three years. Villagers who get too creative with
Christian names are chastised and corrected by the priest. In 2009, for example,
one couple had chosen the name ‘Anunciata’ for their three-year-old daughter,
because they liked the sound of the name and they had heard from someone that
it was the name of a nun somewhere. As the priest from Marienberg was about to
anoint the child, the girl’s godparent told him that the child’s Christian name was
to be ‘Anunciata’. The priest stopped the ceremony.
     “That’s not a Christian name”, he announced. The parents would have to
come up with something different.
     The parents were silent.
     Getting no response, the priest asked who the father was. When he was iden-
tified, he asked him impatiently what other names he had considered for the girl.
The father said nothing.
     From somewhere in the back of the church, one of the mother’s relatives sug-
gested ‘Tema’.
24        1 The Tayap language and its speakers     The priest asked the girl’s father if he wanted the name ‘Tema’ (the girl’s
mother’s wishes or opinions – in keeping with Catholic practice – were not solic-
ited or considered).
     The father answered by looking down at his feet and saying softly, “If you
want to change it, that’s alright” (“Sapos yu laik sensim bai mi bihainim yu”).
     “No”, the priest said to him. “Do you want that name?” (“Nogat, yu laikim
despela nem tu?”)
      The father repeated himself, “If you want to change it, that’s alright”.
     “But do you like the name?” the priest wanted to know. (“Na yu laikim tu?”)
     “Yeah”, said the father reluctantly and barely audibly, “Em i orait” (“It’s OK”).
     Thus did little Anunciata become baptized as Tema, a name that the parents
don’t like at all, and that, consequently, has never been uttered by anyone since
that moment of baptism.
     In day-to-day life, most villagers are called by their village names. A handful
of people, however, are usually called by their Christian name, either because
they want to foreground their Catholic piety, or because their parents never really
liked the village names given to their child, so they got around it by always calling
the child by his or her Christian name.
     For official purposes such as school enrollment or electoral rolls, villagers are
identified by their Christian name and the village name of their father. So Ŋgero,
one of my main language informants in 2009, is identified in official contexts as
Prisila Sair.
     This patrilineal naming practice is contrary to and corrosive of how villagers
reckon kinship, which is matrilineally – a villager belongs to the clan of her or
his mother, not her or his father. Increasingly, however, as a direct result both
of Catholic teaching and government sanctioned conventions such as official
naming practices, fathers are asserting rights over their children, and are begin-
ning to “take” their children into their clans with a frequency that far exceeds
past practice.
     Important mythical ancestors, deities and spirits also have names, as do all
the areas of Gapun’s vast rainforest. The more esoteric names for the ancestors
and deities vanished from Tayap in the 1990s with the last of the village’s truly
knowledgeable big men. Those men declined to pass on the names to their matri-
lineal nephews, as used to be happen, because, they told me in the 1980s, the
names were powerful elements in sorcery chants and could be used to kill people.
The big men who made this decision were all strongly Catholic, and they believed
that their traditional knowledge was part of what was preventing Gapuners from
changing into white people (Kulick 1992).
     Tayap words for commonly visited areas of the rainforest remain known
among villagers, because they walk through the forest every day to hunt, gather

food and go to their gardens or sago swamps. The names of places rarely visited
by villagers and that are several days’ walk from the village are less well known,
and only the oldest people in the village can recite them, after long consultations
with one another.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"
"3.1.3.3 Non-particular nouns
Nouns that otherwise could be expected to be masculine can be feminine under
two circumstances.
     The first is when the subject or referent of a verb is a general class of people
rather than a named or known individual. For example, the following utterance
is from a harangue by an older Tayap speaker who is chastising younger vil-
lagers for behaving badly. In the course of his harangue, the speaker wonders
rhetorically which big man (i.e. which old, knowledgeable man) is still alive to
teach young people about the good ways of the past. (The answer, he knows,
is ‘none’.)
     His question was phrased as follows:(3-22) Ani munje suman wuk?
       who man      big      be.3sg.f.r
       ‘Which big man is here (i.e. still living)?’Note that the verb ‘be’ is inflected in 3sg.f, even though the referent is unambig-
uously a male. The use of the feminine form here conveys generality. It refers to
the category or class of ‘big men’ rather than to a specific big man. If the speaker
had phrased the question using the 3sg.m form of ‘be’, kut, the question would
be referring to a specific named or known big man: ‘Which one of the big men we
all know is present here right now?’
     Another example of the same phenomenon is the following (feminine forms
that denote the male referent are in bold):
                                                                    Nouns        61

       ‘The man is of course finding his strength and doing it on his own,
       nobody else is telling him to’This utterance was spoken during a tense discussion about the incessant and dis-
ruptive drinking in the village that, by late 2009, had been plaguing Gapun for
some time. During a village-wide meeting, the mother of a fifteen-year-old boy
shouted angrily that her husband never tried to stop their son from drinking.
     In response, a man in his late thirties made the comment above, which is
dismissive of the mother and supports the young man’s father by implying that
it wouldn’t matter what the father told his son. The son, this man is saying, is old
enough and would act according to his own desires anyway: no one is ordering
him to drink; he does it because he wants to. But as in the previous example,
(3-22), this utterance refers to a male using feminine grammatical forms.
     The rhetorical effect is the same: the speaker’s use of feminine grammatical
forms when talking about a male conveys a meaning of generality. The speaker
is not overtly disputing anything the mother says about her son or her husband,
these grammatical forms say; he is making a general observation.
     A non-literal but semantically more accurate translation of the man’s remark
would be: ‘As young men get older and stronger of course they decide on their own
what they want to do, they don’t do things just because other people tell them to’.","[80, 81]"
