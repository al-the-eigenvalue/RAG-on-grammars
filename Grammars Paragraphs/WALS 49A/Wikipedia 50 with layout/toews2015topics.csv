"Unlike the /tuw/ case, this morpheme has exactly the same distribution no matter which meaning
it receives, which can be seen in the phrases in (18). Moreover, it is possible to show that the
different functions of this morpheme are semantically related to each other.
        The abstract meaning analysis states that the morpheme 's simply indicates that some
unspecified relation exists between two entities (Kay and Zimmer 1990, also see Partee and
Borschev 1998, 1999). The only way to determine the nature of this relation is to rely on context.
For example, the phrase in (19) could have any of the meanings listed in (19a-e).19.     my grandma's blanket        a.       a blanket my grandma owns
        b.       a blanket my grandma made
        c.       a blanket my grandma sleeps under when she stays with us
        d.       a blanket made using a quilt pattern designed by my grandma
        e.       a blanket I inherited from my grandmaSuppose I were to visit my mother-in-law and found that she had started on a new quilt using my
grandma's pattern. I might say to her, Oh, you're making my grandma's blanket! In that case, the
meaning would have to be the one in (19d). Or, suppose a friend came to stay with me for a
week, and needed some bedding to use. I have a big supply of blankets in the back closet, but
one of them is reserved for my grandma, so I tell her, You can use any of these blankets except
that one- it's my grandma's blanket. In that case, the meaning would be the one in (19c).
        Higginbotham (1983) formalizes this theory as follows: A genitive phrase is represented
as in (20a), where NP1 is the genitive-marked noun phrase214 and N' is the thing that is possessed.
The meaning of 's is expanded in (20b), which states that for the unique entity, x, x is N' and x is
in some relation (R) to NP1 (from Higginbotham (1983:397–398). If the specific NP in question
is my grandma's blanket (20c), and the context is the one from (19d), then the representation in
(20b) can be filled out as in (20d).",[300]
"26.      Present Imperfective
217
    Although the usual pattern is for imperfective utterances like (24a) to have a present time reference and
imperfective + ín utterances like (24b) to have past time reference, it is possible for imperfective utterances without
ín to have past time reference as well. For example, see (26-27) in 5.2.2.2.
218
    The French translation does not match the context: the pronoun is feminine, but the context is about a brother.
This is because the context is from one elicitation session, and the translation is from another when I was doing a
grammaticality check. Siamou pronouns do not have gender distinctions.
219
    The contexts in (24a) and (24b) are slightly different: in one case you and I are with my brother and in the other
case only I am with my brother.",[304]
"                                                                                                                     53
Although bare verbs function as imperatives (66), imperatives may also be formed with ki plus a
bare verb (67). In this case, a subject is required, and the meaning changes slightly, as in (66-67)
(Haas 2004).","[75, 76]"
"3.3.2.4 A (Possible) Argument from Auxiliation
Languages sometimes use auxiliary verbs to allow more than one kind of aspect in a clause. For
example, in English, the auxiliary have (+past participle) introduces perfect aspect and the
auxiliary be (+present participle) introduces progressive aspect. These aspects can stack, as
shown with the perfect progressive sentence in (64a). However, it is not possible for these
aspects to stack on the same verb, as evidenced by the utterance in (64b) which attempts to stack
the past and present participial forms of the verb think.64.      a.       He has been thinking.
         b.       * He is thinking-ed         If we only looked at (64b), we might conclude that English does not allow aspect
stacking either, but that is clearly not true (see Cinque 1999). It just does not allow stacking on
the same verb. There is some evidence that this may be the case in Siamou as well. The utterance
in (65) expresses both prospective aspect and imperfective aspect. In order to accommodate both,
the utterance uses the verb tɛŋn ('be/become') with prospective aspect morphology. Imperfective
aspect is marked with an imperfective nominal táaŋn that is the subject of the verb.",[167]
"                                                                                                               271
In this case, a word has one meaning that is so abstract that it can include all of its seemingly
distinct uses. Only context and other extra-linguistic factors determine which particular meaning
is employed. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. It could be, for example, that the
meaning of ín is abstract enough to include some but not all of the meanings listed above, and
the rest are conversational implicatures.
         The four possible ways of analyzing the meanings of ín that I discussed above can be
diagrammed as in (8): Homophony (8a) is represented by individual circles, one for each
meaning, and no link between them. The letters inside indicate different meanings. Polysemy
(8b) is represented by individual circles with lines linking them. Conversational implicature (8c)
has one basic meaning (a) in a circle surrounded by a larger, hazy circle that represents the
additional, unstated meaning. Abstract meaning (8d) is represented by one large circle labeled D.
D represents the abstract meaning, which subsumes the individual meanings represented by
a,b,c.8.       a.     Accidental Homophony (Meanings are unrelated, just happen to sound the same.)
         b.     Polysemy (The meanings are semantically linked.)
                                                                                                    272
       c.      Conversational Implicature (One of the meanings is primary, and the others arise
               from that meaning in conjunction with other relevant information.)
       d.      Abstract Meaning (There is one meaning that is abstract enough to include all the
               seemingly distinct meanings.)
6.2.1 Accidental Homophony Hypothesis
Accidental homophony means that each instance of a multi-functional morpheme with its
particular meaning is distinct, and it is merely a coincidence that they all have the same
phonological form.
       For example, in English, the form /tuw/ has a number of meanings, including a numeral
(two), an additive particle (too) and a preposition (to). There is no clear link between these
meanings. They have different spellings which reflect distinct origins. These morphemes also
have very different syntactic distributions. The numeral (two) modifies nouns, which the other
morphemes do not (9).9.     a.      We have two sofas.
       b.      * We have too sofas.
       c.      * We have to sofas.","[293, 294, 295]"

    The verbs in (Table 3.37k-n) all have a coda r while none of the other verbs in this table do. In these verbs (but
not the others), /i/ is pronounced [ɪ], and this is likely related to the fact that they pattern differenctly in the
perfective and imperfective forms (Paul Thiessen p.c).
126
    The verb form dénno is unusual. It often acts as the perfective of the verb don (go). However, the actual (regular)
perfective of don is dòn. There are rules governing the use of dòn versus dénno which I am not very familiar with.
However, the first form occurs more in negative clauses and the latter occurs more in affirmative clauses. The verb
form dénno patterns differently in the grammar as well. For example, dénno can occur with the non-finite particle ki,
which no other perfective can do, suggesting that it is probably not a perfective, although it functions as one in many
cases. It is possible that dénno is multi-morphemic. Siamou has a suffix -no which means something like 'go', and
this suffix can attach to some other bare verbs. I am not sure what the dén would be in that case.
Throughout this thesis, I have glossed dénno as go.PRFV?. The ? indicates that I am not sure of its status.",[188]

the segmental form of the verb stem in those languages: the only difference between them is
tone. In Table 3.25 above, the imperfective also had the same segmental form as the verb stem
(or the same as the perfective in the cases where the verb stem is not explicitly stated). However,
those imperfectives are the exception rather than the norm. Usually, Kru imperfectives are
marked segmentally, and not just tonally.","[174, 175]"

2.3.3.6 Possessor: Poss (ǹ) NP
           I assume for now that possessors in Siamou are complements of NP.33 All the data is of
definite possessed nouns, which appear to be more common than indefinite possessed nouns.
Definite possessed nouns occur with the definite enclitic, as in (48) but not with the definite
particle, à (49). Inalienable possession (relations and body parts) is marked by the possessor
followed by the possessed noun.",[68]

                        French: Il a mangé de la nourriture. (C)There are two main ways to derive this: for Kayne (1994), it must be the case that Siamou has an
underlying head-initial (VO) word order. In this case the aspect head precedes the verb phrase
(Asp VP) and the verb has to raise and adjoin to the aspect head in order to derive the surface
(VP Asp) order, as shown in (33a). The object must also raise to a higher position (called Spec
AgrOP) in order to derive the surface (OV Asp) ordering (see Pollock 1989 and Roberts 1997).
        The second possibility, which Kayne (1994) would reject, is that Siamou has an
underlying head-final (OV) word order. In this case, the aspect head follows the verb and can
attach to it via right-alignment (V Asp). This is shown in (33b).33.     a.                                                  b.",[149]

of a context in which M(L) patterns differently than the other two. However, the M(L) group is

3.2.2.3 The Structure of Aspect in Siamou Following Kru (Koopman 1984, Marchese 1986)
It appears that Siamou is even more strongly SOV than other Kru languages. Not only does it
have exclusive SOV word order, it also does not have some SVO characteristics that the other
Kru languages have. If Kru is underlyingly SOV, as argued by Koopman (1984) and Marchese
(1986), then Siamou would certainly be underlyingly SOV. According to this argumentation, the
best representation of aspect is not (54a), as Kayne's (1994) theory of anti-symmetry would
require, but (54b) in which the verb phrase is head final, and aspect adjoins to the right edge of
the verb phrase. In this case, no movement is required because this is exactly the surface order.54.    a.                                            b.",[156]

about this more in 2.3.3.5 when I look at definiteness.
         Notice that the second and third person pronouns have the same segmental form, but
different tone melodies. This is true for both the singular (á, à) and plural pronouns (yíi, yì).
Also, the singular and plural first person pronouns have the same segmental form but different
tone melodies (ń, n̂ ).25

   The pronoun yíi is sometimes shortened to yí.
24
   I am not sure of the syntactic status of the definite particle à, which is why I call it a definite particle rather than a
definite article. See Elbourne (2005) for a discussion of pronouns that have the semantics of definite determiners.

   In other Kru languages, it is usually the first and second person pronouns that have the same segmental form, as in
Vata where the first and second person singular pronouns are n̍ and ǹ and the first and second person plural

"                                                                                                               239
5.2.2.6 Imperfective Event Time Exceeds Temporal Boundary of Adverbial Modifier
In this section I show that -n marks verbs as having an event time that extends past the
boundaries of the reference time, which is the definition of imperfective.
         The following examples show that the verbs inflected with the -n suffix are understood to
begin at some point before the beginning of the time denoted by the temporal phrase and end at
some point after the end of that time. In this case, the temporal phrase is an adverbial. In the
imperfective examples below, the event is not contained in the reference time.","[261, 262]"
"       The above examples show that ín can implicate doubt when it occurs with perfective-
marked verbs (101b, 104) and with stative-marked verbs (102, 103, 105). In (106), I show that it
is possible for ín to convey a sense of doubt even when it occurs in an environment where its
usual function is simply to mark past tense (i.e. with imperfective aspect). In this case it still
marks past tense, but it also conveys doubt, not about the eating, but about what happened after.
This supports analyzing the sense of doubt as an implicature. If doubt were a separate meaning
of ín we would expect it to either mark past tense or doubt, but not both.",[340]
"4.4.2.3 Imperfective Aspect Is Not Required in Contexts That Force a Present Construal
The second test that morpheme X is not present tense involves showing that it is not required in
all present contexts. If a morpheme encoded present tense, it would be somewhat surprising
(although not impossible) for it not to appear in utterances that are interpreted as present tense.
This test, like the previous one, is not airtight. Present construals can arise in utterances that have
no tense or aspect marking at all, as is the case for non-verbal predicates. For example, Modern
Hebrew has a present tense, but it does not occur in non-verbal predicates such as (47).
Nevertheless, these kinds of predicates have a present interpretation (Doron 1983).",[231]
"                                                                                                   312
        The following example shows that this implicature can be cancelled. It is possible to
assert that something was the case, and is in fact still the case (91).91.     À      lɔ̂     ín       fù       nì      à       lɔ̂   yé.

        It was white and it's still white.        context: Talking about a house that was painted white.","[334, 335]"
"        The syntactic distribution of these morphemes supports our intuition, based on a lack of
semantic connection, that this is a case of homophony. (See Lyon et al. (2004) for discussion.)
6.2.2 Polysemy Hypothesis
Polysemy describes morphemes that have more than one related meaning. For example, the word
lamb can be used to refer to an animal (as in 12a), or to the meat from that animal (as in 12b).
(See Copestake and Briscoe (1996), among others.)12.     a.       This lamb is so cute!                        (lamb=animal)
        b.       This lamb is so tender and juicy!            (lamb=meat)        It may be argued that these two uses of the word lamb are related, and therefore a case of
polysemy, since they both refer to nearly the same physical object, except that one refers to the
living, whole animal, while the other refers to cut up parts of it.213
6.2.3 Conversational Implicature Hypothesis
An implicature is a meaning an utterance has beyond what is actually said. Conversational
implicature refers to the way in which speakers use principles of communication to make an
implicature. These principles are listed in (13) as discussed in Grice (1989).13.     a.       Maxim of Quantity:         Be as informative as required, but not more.
        b.       Maxim of Quality:          Be truthful.
        c.       Maxim of Relation:         Be relevant.
        d.       Maxim of Manner:           Be perspicuous (i.e. clear and concise).",[296]

Other similarities between Siamou and other Kru languages include a number of grammatical
morphemes that appear to be cognates (such as the negative particle bo in Siamou and the
negative particle be in Grebo), and word order, both in the verbal and nominal domains. Person
(1966) also gives a historical explanation for the geographical distance between Siamou and the
other Kru languages, arguing that Kru languages were originally spoken further north than they
are now, in Ivory Coast and Liberia, until the Mandé and the Maninka pushed them out. Most of
them moved south, except for the Siamou, who fled north into Burkina Faso (Person 1966).",[101]
"269
    I am not sure if futures of any kind ever actually entail that an event is realized though. This would mean that
speakers have to know the future. What is important, I think, is whether or not the speakers believe the event will be
realized. In (34), supposedly the monkey actually intends to bite. With futures-in-the-past, as in (35), it is quite
common for the event not to be realized (Iatridou 2000).
270
    See 7.3.3 for a brief discussion of why this diagnostic might be problematic. The diagnostics for future
expressions are now such that they almost rule out future tense altogether. This is interesting because maybe it says
something important about language: that there's no such thing as future tense at all. If that is the case, what is the
significance of that? Alternatively, perhaps we have just restricted the definition of future tense so much as to make
it useless. As Enç (1996) points out, if we define tense too strictly, we end up ruling it out altogether. In that case,
maybe we need to re-evaluate our criteria for future tense.",[366]
"4.4.1.5 Perfective Aspect Does Not Combine with Imperfective
If a grammatical morpheme is a perfective aspect, it is expected that it can not combine with
imperfective morphology.142 Perfectives and imperfectives are expected to be in complementary
distribution because by definition, an utterance cannot have both perfective and imperfective
aspect.143
141
    I am not saying that languages cannot have more than one past tense morpheme. Many Niger-Congo languages
make distinctions between different degrees of pastness, such as remote past and recent past (Nurse 2008). In the
absence of such a contrast, we only expect one past tense marker.
142
    The past morpheme, in contrast, can co-occur with the imperfective, as I show in 4.6.2.4.
143
    Although see Comrie 1976:31–32 for one case where two aspectual categories labeled perfective and
imperfective do co-occur.",[216]
"3.2.1 Siamou and Kayne's Conjecture
This section has three subparts. Section 3.2.1.1 briefly explains the theory of anti-symmetry.
Section 3.2.1.2 shows that Siamou has consistent surface SOV (i.e. complement-head) word
order. In anti-symmetry theory, Siamou's SOV word order must be derived by raising. In this
case, we might expect to find other instances of raising in Siamou syntax. I look for evidence this
in 3.2.1.3, with mixed results. Finally, 3.2.1.4 presents two possible structures of the Siamou
aspect phrase, and shows which one Kayne's (1994) theory predicts to be correct.",[142]
"In this case, the modal base contains propositions that have to do with real-world facts: for
example, I am a graduate student. Graduate students write dissertations in order to graduate.
Finishing a dissertation requires working on it. These facts are all consistent with each other. The
ordering source in this case consists of the set of propositions expressed by the phrase what I
want. I have two relevant desires: I want to finish my dissertation, but I also want to never work
on it. The propositions in the modal base (the facts about the world) are not inconsistent with
each other. Nor are my desires inconsistent with each other. It is only when we try to combine
the worlds picked out by the modal base (i.e. the factual worlds) with the worlds picked out by
the ordering source (i.e. the worlds in which I get what I want) that we encounter inconsistencies.
Unfortunately, there are no worlds in which I can have everything I want because the world is

it doesn't restrict the set of worlds.",[358]

4.4.1.6 Perfective Has Event Time Contained in Temporal Boundary of Adverbial Modifier
The remaining three tests (4.3.1.6-4.3.1.8) involve determining whether or not a morpheme
marks events as having an initial point, a final point or both (Klein's (1994) three types of
perfectives). One test is to show that an event has both an initial and a final point within the
reference time, the second shows an utterance to have a final point within the reference time,
without giving any information on whether or not it has an initial point, and the third shows an
utterance to lack a final point within the reference time. The third test has been used as a test for
initial points (Bar-el 2005), but I argue that it makes more sense to use it as a test for final points.
Without a dedicated initial point test, I find no way to conclusively determine if Klein's (1994)
second type of perfective exists (the one with a final point but no initial point, shown in (16b)).
        The same morpheme can potentially mark all three types of perfective, depending on
factors such as context or the event type of the verb. This means, for example, that just because a
test shows a morpheme to have a final point in one context does not mean it has a final point in
all contexts. However, if a morpheme marks one or more of Klein's (1994) three types of
perfective, calling that morpheme perfective is warranted.
        In the next few paragraphs I give a summary of the initial/final point tests. The third test,
the inceptive reading test, is the most controversial, so I spend extra time discussing it.
        The first of these tests is a test for initial and final points. Its purpose is to show that in at
least some cases (and probably in most cases) utterances marked with this morpheme are
characterized by having an event time that is completely contained within a reference time,
which is a perfective with an initial and a final point (shown in 16c). I look at utterances with
temporal adverbial phrases that mark the reference time and show that an event described by a
verb inflected with this morpheme is understood to occur completely within the time frame given
by the adverbial phrase. For example, in the sentence She painted the house purple while I
watched, the temporal phrase while I watched provides the reference time. English speakers
understand the event painting the house purple to be completely contained within the time frame
of the period defined by the phrase while I watched. That is to say, the whole event of painting
was completed while I watched. If the Siamou morpheme in question has this property, it must
be a perfective (in both Kratzer's (1998) and Klein's (1994) theories).","[216, 217]"

descriptive predicates, such as (122d), as well as interrogatives, exclamatives, and responses. He

the noun phrase, not the noun), and a few other topics.122.61 a.        Məә́kâl         mí             səә̀kār          mɔ̄́   (Traoré 1985:17)

updated the glosses to be consistent with the rest of this thesis.",[102]
"Bè may also occur with a bare verb (10). In this case it usually has a 'managed to/succeeded at'
reading.",[351]
"       Another way of looking at it is that politeness may either be an implicature itself, or a
meaning that arises as the result of an implicature (an implicature of an implicature?). For
example, in (99), the utterance has a counterfactual implicature. The lexical meaning includes
past tense, and the implicature is that the speaker did not actually drink water. If the listener
hears this and assumes that what the speaker said is relevant to their current situation, he might
wonder why the speaker did not drink, and then realize that it is because he is in the way, and
then move out of the way without the speaker having to ask him directly to move. Notice here
that although the utterance is marked with past tense, there is nothing past about the situation: the
speaker currently wants water, and the listener is currently in the way.
       In this section, I discussed the politeness and doubt readings of past tense ín. However, it
is not clear whether these are conversational implicatures derived from conversational maxims
(Grice 1989), or some other kind of implicature. It is possible that they are implicatures that have
been conventionalized. (See Recanati (2003).) At this point, I am not sure how to derive them.
       In the following paragraphs I consider and reject some alternative analyses for these
readings. In 6.2 I discussed four possible ways that the meanings of a multi-functional morpheme
can be related (or not related). I have argued that all of the meanings of ín except past tense arise
from conversational implicature. In this section, I would like to explore alternative analyses for
the politeness and doubt readings (abstract meaning in particular), and show why the implicature
analysis is the best one. The four possibilities are shown in (111). I have grouped politeness and
doubt (P/D) together for simplicity.111.   a.      Homophony
                                                                                                    321
       b.      Polysemy
       c.      Conversational Implicature
       d.      Abstract Meaning
The first possibility (homophony, (111a)) is that ín marks past tense, and also politeness and
doubt, but there is no connection between them. This is very unlikely. It is very common for past
tense to mark politeness and irrealis-type things (such as doubt) in many languages (see
Fleischman 1989, Klein 1994). Since this is not unique to Siamou, it is likely not an accident,
and we would prefer to find a connection between the two sets of meanings.
       The second possibility (polysemy, 111b) is that the meanings are distinct, but that there is
some link between them. Fleischman (1989) frames the connection between them as a metaphor.
She suggests that just like the past tense distances us from the present, doubt distances us from
reality, and politeness distances us from the situation in a way that places less obligation on the
listener. However, if we adopted this analysis for Siamou, we would expect that it would have
either one reading (past tense) or the other (politeness or doubt). Since it can mark past tense and
doubt simultaneously, this explanation does not work (although the insight that temporal distance
can be a metaphor for social distance is interesting and useful).
       Conversational implicature (111c) was explored above.
       The fourth possibility, abstract meaning (111d), also makes use of the concept of
distancing. In this theory, ín has the function of taking a central point on a scale and giving as its
                                                                                                   322
value a displacement from that central point. The scale is not specified, which is how the
meaning comes to be more abstract than just past tense. It can be temporal, in which case the
central point (T0) is the present, and ín marks past tense (T0-1). The scale can be modal, in
which case the central point is the real world and ín marks an event as being some distance from
the real world, which is what causes it to be interpreted as doubt. The scale can also refer to the
speaker's investment in the situation, in which case ín marks politeness. If the scale is temporal,
T0 represents the speech time (the present), and then the function of ín is to place the reference
time of an utterance at some point preceding T0, which is past tense. If T0 is the present, then
T0-1 is the past. This is shown in the diagram in (112). (See Fleischman (1989) for discussion.)112.     Temporal Distance         --------------[(T0-1)]----------------[T0]         There are three main objections to this theory. First of all, the temporal scale differs from
the other scales in that there is more than one direction that can be distant from the central point:
either the past or the future. If ín only marks distance, then it should be able to be used for future
events as well, which it is not. Secondly, if the meaning is so abstract that it does not specify the
scale, then we expect there to be other scales as well, such as locative, for example. The particle
ín shows no indication of being used to mark physical distance from the speaker.251 Thirdly, I
showed in (100), repeated as (113) below, that ín can mark past tense and doubt simultaneously.
This makes sense if doubt is a conversational implicature, but not if it is part of a more abstract
meaning.113.              À     fɔn             le     leè-n                    ín       kyáŋmɔ.

"       This suggests that the completive with ín parallels the perfective with ín, but I do not
have enough data to present a complete analysis at this time. It is possible that the default past
interpretation of the completive aspect is also cancelable in certain contexts, In that case, we
would expect that ín would also shift such utterances to the past.
       To summarize, I have shown that ín can mark past tense in combination with all
grammatical aspect categories, as well as with non-verbal predicates. Since ín always marks past
tense, I conclude that this is its primary meaning. In the next section, I look at the remaining

the affirmative (35a) to S(Aux)OV in the negative (76b). Negative particles do not have such an
effect (77b).
       Notice in (78) that the object kùà and the verb nu are reversed from one example to the

Siamou has mixed word order properties. For example, in Siamou enclitics and suffixes are
much more predominant than proclitics and prefixes. Enclitics are used to mark plurality (26a)

Ín can also give rise to the implicature that something that was the case is not the case anymore.

The subject suffix often shows up as -a (as in 75b) but on pronouns, it usually assimilates to the
vowel of the pronoun (as in 74b). As for the verbal suffix, Marchese (1986) notes that ""in the
majority of Kru languages [it] has the same form: a front vowel which typically agrees in vowel
height and vowel harmony with the verb stem. Often the imperfective suffix completely replaces
the final vowel of the verb stem or it may cause morpho-phonological changes within the verb
stem itself” (Marchese 1986:40). Some examples of this are given in Table 3.27.","[175, 176]"
"7.2.2.3 The Modal Force
The third dimension of a modal is the modal force which is the relative strength of a modal. It
has to do with whether a modal is a universal or existential quantifier over possible worlds.
Modal force ranges from strong necessity (something has to be the case) to weak possibility
(something might be the case). Strong necessity is a universal quantifier and weak possibility is
an existential quantifier. For example, compare the two utterances in (20).20.     a.       You must go to bed.
        b.       You may go to bed.",[359]

       c.      E-S-R       Reichenbach's (1947) theory only has room for three R/E relations (which Klein (1994)
calls aspect): perfect, prospective and ""simple."" Klein (1994) introduces more fine-grained
aspectual distinctions by allowing R and E to overlap in more than one way. This means that the
aspect relation shown in Table 4.6a-c (i.e. R , E) is ambiguous. It includes both perfective and
imperfective aspect. These aspects are discussed in great detail in 4.2.
       Klein (1994) lists all the logically possible kinds of tense and aspect allowed by his
theory. However, there is cross-linguistic variability in the ways that languages grammaticalize
                                                                                                174
tense and aspect. First of all, languages may combine more than one category. For example,
Matthewson (2006) argues that St'át'imcets has a covert morpheme that is indeterminate between
a past tense and a present tense reading. It simply specifies ""non-future."" Secondly, languages
may not necessarily mark all the potential tense or aspect contrasts. In such cases, a particular
tense or aspect construal may arise by default.128
         The definition of aspect given in this section is sometimes called grammatical aspect to
distinguish it from lexical aspect. Furthermore, Liao (2005) argues that grammatical aspect can
be split into two kinds: temporal aspect, which includes perfect and prospective aspect, and
viewpoint aspect, which includes perfective and imperfective aspect (see 3.3.1 for more
information). In the next section I look first at grammatical aspect in more detail, and then at
lexical aspect and its interaction with grammatical aspect in 4.3.","[196, 197]"
"2.3.3 The Extended Nominal Projection
The tree below represents the structure of Siamou's nominal projection to the best of my current
understanding. At the very bottom is the noun, bisháɑŋn ('child'). It takes an optional kase phrase
(KP) complement, which is a possessor. At the next level is the adjective phrase (tíin tíin 'small').
Above this is the plural enclitic -è, and then the definite enclitic -î. One step higher is the
demonstrative suffix -ni, and then the definite particle à. The highest level contains the
possessive particle ǹ.",[60]

3.2.1.2 Siamou Is Consistently Head-Final
In Siamou, sentences always have surface SOV word order, as shown in (21) above. In fact, all
lexical heads in Siamou follow their complements. This is true for verb phrases (24a), noun
phrases (24b) and postpositional phrases (24c).9524.      a.       DP       V         [le]    [dì]

   For simpilicity, the diagram in (23) leaves out the aspectual inflection of the verb dì and uses only the bare verb
form di. Later in 3.2.1.4 I show the structure of the aspect phrase as well.

adjectives.",[144]

Therefore, if the noun is modified, the plural marking attaches to the adjective phrase (40a-b),
not the noun (40c). If the adjective is distributive (i.e. applying to each child individually), it is
