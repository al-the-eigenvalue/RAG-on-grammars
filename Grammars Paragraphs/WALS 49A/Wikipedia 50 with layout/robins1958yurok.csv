"                                  14.2      Particles   with   VerbsPreverbal particles occur singly or in groups of two or more before the
verbs to which they refer. They may be disjoined from the verb by inter-
vening adverbs, adverbial phrases, numeral words, or pronouns.        Only
co(?) (14.21 No. 37) was found disjoined from its verb by a noun. Almost
all the particles can be used singly; in groups their relative order to one
another is not fixed.
    Yurok verbs may be used in sentences, as has been seen, without any
preverbal particles, and the syntactic functions of the particle + verb com-
plexes are equivalent to those of verbs by themselves. The particles may
be used with any verb form,               inflected or noninflected,   in the verbal   system,
though certain particles have specific functions when used with certain
specific verb forms; such functions are described below under the particles
concerned.
    Broadly speaking, the meanings that may be given to these particles in
the Yurok language correspond to those ascribed in many other languages
to tense and aspect forms of verbs, as well as to rather more specific
meanings for which adverbial words are used. The preverbal particles,
used both singly and in groups,              provide the Yurok language with a flexible
and sensitive range of verbal expressions, comparable to that achieved by
a complex tense and aspect system in other languages.
     The particles are listed below singly and then in groups, the same order
of listing being used throughout. Examples of all the groups occurring in
my notes are given, and the number of examples given with each particle
or group of particles is intended to be some indication of their relative fre-
quency of occurrence in the language as I recorded it.
     An attempt is made to give a single translation to each particle listed.
‘n some cases this is relatively easy; in others only a general summary of
 ts usages in sentences can be given. In each case it must be borne in mind
 that especially for words of ti.is type that do not normally occur in sentences
 2xcept as part of larger constructions, isolated translation meanings can
 -epresent no more than general abstractions from the various contributions
 che words make to the meanings of the total sentences in which they occur.",[109]

main     or sole verb       in sentences.                The    imperative           forms       are used   for com-
mands,       as in other languages.                The syntactic functions of the forms of the
other verbal paradigms are stated in the relevant sections in each case.
    There are three persons, as in pronouns, and two numbers, singular
and plural,  with separate dual forms for the first and second persons
in certain paradigms of a very small number of verbs (13.144). There
is concord         of number       between           subject       and        verb       where     it has   formal ex-
ponents.
                                         GRAMMAR13.111        Inflected verbs
    Inflected verbs are Transitive and Intransitive. Only transitive verbs
have bipersonal, reflexive, reciprocal, and complete passive paradigms.
   Inflected verbs may be classified as e-class or o-class, according to tk
series of inflections used,      e and    o respectively being the commonest          vows
in the two series of inflections. A very few verbs fall into an a-class.
    e-class verbs are more numerous than o-class verbs, but a number of
the most commonly used verbs belong to the o-class; o-class verbs tend to
have more variations and irregularities in their inflections than e-class
verbs.","[42, 43]"

third person pronoun. Both are without distinction of number.    wi? is the
form used in slow or deliberate speech; wi is more common in quick speech.
    In addition to their use in forming emphatic personal pronouns and the
group ko?1 wi,      someone,   wi(?) and wiS may also be used for purposes
of emphasis with nouns and with other classes of pronouns. Their normal
position in this use is immediately after the noun or other pronoun, but oc-
casionally this order is varied.     wi(?) and wiS             may also be used by themselves                     as personal pronouns,               for

                        7.   PROMINENCE          AND    INTONATIONStress and pitch are not used as lexically differential features in Yurok, but
are rather to be regarded as features of tempo and style. In connected spee:
most words of more than one syllable have one syllable prominent, by its
being on a higher pitch than adjacent syllable and sometimes bearing louder
stress as well; but the same word may have any one of its syllables promi-
nent according to the style, tempo, and rhythmic pattern of the sentence.
Monosyllabic words may also be prominent, but this is rarely the case ex-
cept with monosyllabic nouns and verbs,
    Where a prominent syllable has a long vowel, this vowel may be some-
what overlengthened and on a markedly higher pitch, this being particularly
noticeable when prominence falls on monosyllabic words containing long
vowels.
    The basic intonation in Yurok is a falling sequence of prominent syllables
with the nonprominent syllables at a lower pitch. The sequences end in eithe
a final falling pitch or a final low pitch preceded by a somewhat higher pitch
on the penultimate syllable. The final falling pitch often occurs with impera-
tival sentences, but is not confined to them. In long sentences the sequence
may rise once or twice (apart from the higher pitch of prominent monosyl-
lables mentioned above), before the final fall.
    Questions often begin rather higher than statements, or rise to a higher
pitch early in the sentence, but there is no specific intonation associated
with interrogative sentences.
    Medial pause in sentences is accompanied by a mid-level pitch on the las:
syllable before the pause.
    In excited, angry, or emphatic speech, prominent syllables are higher                      in
pitch and more loudly stressed than is usual in the normal speech of the
speaker.

1e following word classes can be established formally by reference to mor
iological and syntactical criteria, and provide a convenient frame for the
‘ammatical and syntactical analysis of the language: Nominals, Verbals,
reverbal particles, Adverbs, Prepositions, Conjunctions.
  Nominals are subdivided into Pronouns and Nouns, and Verbals are sub-
vided into Verbs,          Numerals,           and Adjectives.
 Nominals and to a far greater extent verbals make use of the morpholog?
1 processes described below (9.1). Members of the other word classes a)
th some exceptions invariable.
 There are no regular derivational processes by which                               words     of one clas
ay be derived from those of another class. A number of forms occur as
rammatical neutrals,"" and can function either as nouns or as noninflecte
rbs (13,112), and several pairs of noun and verb are found with related
2zanings and similar forms, but these similarities do not reveal any sys:
matizable correspondences.","[22, 23]"

                                          LEXICON
In the Yurok-English section entries are made in an order corresponding as
nearly as possible to the order of the English alphabet. Words appearing in
the language in more than one morphological form are cited by their stems
(9.1); in cases where more than one stem form is used in the total paradigm
of the word, it is cited under its most commonly occurring stem. Where the
various forms of words are sufficiently indicated by the form of the stem
and the designation of the word class to which it belongs, the relevant infor-
mation given in the grammatical sections is not repeated here; on the other
hand all irregular forms or exceptions to the general rules are listed under
the relevant stems.
    Where a verb stem is entered with the final part bracketed, this indicates
that the unbracketed part is used as a noninflected verb (13.112) with the
same meaning as the longer inflected forms of the inflected stem.     Thus
skewok(sim-), to love, means that skewok is used as the equivalent of the
inflected    forms     skewoksimek,      I love,     skewoksi?m,      he,     she    loves,     etc.,
formed on the stem skewoksim-;              and pla?ay(-),        to be big (animals and birds)
means that plu?.zy is used as the equivalent of the inflected forms pl4?.4?y,
it is big, pla?ayei, they are big, etc., formed on the stem pla?.ay-.
    Among the inflected verbals the following subclasses of stems are found;
their inflections, where they differ from the general verbal inflections, are
described in the grammatical sections listed below, and apart from irregu-
larities within these subclasses they are not referred to individually in the
dictionary,     as the    citation of the   stem     makes      clear the   subclass      (if any)      to
which the word belongs:   a-modifying verbs, 13.141.1 F(1), 13.141.2A(1),    13.141.2A(2)a,                           13,.141.3C,

for which no isolated English translation              can   reasonably     be given,     are   not
listed in the English-Yurok section.
   In both sections English nouns are written alone (e.g., swallow), verbs
are followed by ""to"" (e.g., swallow, to), and adjectives are followed by ""to
be""   (e.g.,   red,   to be).   Other   English   parts   of speech   are indicated       where
necessary.
   ""Transitive,"" ""intransitive,"" and ""impersonal"" referring to Yurok verbals
designate the formal subclasses to which the words belong in the language
(13.111, 13.113). ""Transitive"" and ""intransitive"" used of English verbs
serve to specify them further in terms of traditional English grammar.

PREPOSITIONS                                                 16.1      GeneralPrepositions immediately preceding nominals, nominal groups, or adverbs
form groups with the syntactic function of adverbs. Yurok prepositions are
few in number, and mostly of very generalized meanings, which are ustalls
further specified for translation purposes by the verb in the sentence.     The
construction nominal + adverb with pronominal prefix (15.4) to some extent
takes the place of many of the prepositional phrases of European languages.
Nouns following prepositions may, but need not, be in the locative form; the
comitative forms of pronouns may be used after prepositions.
    Several of the prepositions are the same in form and of related meaning
to certain preverbal particles; but their quite different syntactic function,
even when compared to the preverbal particle + noun constructions (14.4),
makes it necessary to set them up as a separate category in the grammar
of the language.","[155, 156]"
"      Group 181: mi(?) ?uma
         yo? mi ?uma nes_  he has                   not come14.321
    In some cases, sequences of preverbal particles, the first of whichis a
negative particle, with an adverbial word or words intervening, must not be
interpreted as a disjoined group of particles, but the negative particle must
be taken as immediately endocentric with the adverb to form an adverbial
phrase, the whole sequence being endocentric with the verb as head.      nimi cpa: ko ?0 nepi?mo?w nepuy       soon (lit., not late) you will eat salmon
      mos cpega‘k no?0i kem ?0 cwinkep ku mewimor            then the old man spoke

inals in endocentric groups were found. Only those particles listed                                           were

16.2C, 16.2D, but as the local reference of the words is back, as with many preverbal

seems better to treat them as preverbal particles.

ADVERBS                                               15.1       GeneralAdverbs may be distinguished from preverbal particles by their greater
freedom of syntactic combination and positional occurrence in the sentence.
Though most commonly used singly or in groups in endocentric construc-
tions with a verb as head word, adverbs are also found in such constructions
with a noun or with another adverb as head.                              In most cases adverbs          may    pre-
cede or follow the verb or other head word in their construction, and the
restrictions on intervening words between preverbal particle and verb de-
scribed above           (14.1) do not apply to adverb + verb constructions.
    Generally         speaking      adverbs         are invariable         words,    though   some     can have
pronominal prefixes, mostly third person (15.4), and some have the -s (-S)
suffix (15.6). A few adverbs are formed with the -eg- infix (cf. 13.151).    cegeykek¥    in small quantities (cf. ceykel-, to be small)

                                                9.1   MorphologyThe morphology of Yurok can best be analyzed by setting up word stems                                   to
serve as a basis for the description of the various morphological formations
In some cases the stem will have the same shape as the word itself in some
grammatical form; in others it will be an abstraction from the various gran
matical forms of the word. The forms of most words can be analyzed by
reference to a single stem form, but in a few cases separate forms of the
stem have to be set up. These are indicated in the relevant sections.
    The morphological processes? employed in Yurok grammar comprise
Prefixation, Infixation, Inflection,* Vowel Harmony, and Internal Vocalic
Alternation,
    Prefixation and infixation operate in both nominals and verbals, as well
as with some words of other classes. Infixation and, to a lesser extent,
vocalic alternation operate principally with verbals, playing a restricted
part elsewhere in the grammar. Vowel harmony operates in certain words
of both nominal and verbal classes.
    The prefixes comprise the Pronominal Prefixes (11.35, 13.141.4). Ther.
is one infix,  -eg- and its variants (13.151), used generally with verbals ar
also with a few nouns and adverbs and with one preverbal particle, so’
The inflectional elements are numerous and of very frequent employment,
principally with verbals.
    Vowel harmony applies to certain prefixes, infixes, and inflections,
according to the vocalic and consonantal structure of the word stem. In the
prefixes and inflections to which it is applicable, vowel harmony is in gen
eral a facultative, not an obligatory, process; where applicable to infixes     *Cf.   9.21,
   3The use of the term ""Process,"" and of other words that often have connotations of
temporal occurrence and historical priority, is made for convenience only. Certain
forms and stems are taken as basic and the structure of other forms is described by
reference to them, as this makes for the simplest method of statement. No suggestion
of changes or processes in time should be read into the use of such words.
   ‘""Inflection"" is used throughout            to refer to formations    postfixed to stems   or involvin
the final part of stems.

t and     u,   playing    no    part in vowel harmony.
   Internal vocalic alternation involves three alternating pairs,                                   e/i-,     e/i?i,°

"F,     afi:, 1/i?i,        a/u-

   Apart from its use as a verb, to be, to happen, to do, this verb has a num-
ber of special functions, which may conveniently be summarized here:
   After several noninflected verbs denoting qualities or attributes, son(ow-)
may be added to give a vaguer meaning to the verb concerned.      lo?ogey       to be black (adjective,                 13.221),      lo?ogey son(ow-),             to be blackish

13.21       Numerals
     Syntactically,           numerals            mostly        precede     nouns     to form           endocentric      nomi-

a single ""petrified"" form is used syntactically in positions that would require
several different inflections in a verb. The most striking feature of the Yurok
numeral          system (a feature shared,                      though to a lesser extent,                   by the adjectives

similar general meanings                         (round things,        plants,       human beings,             etc.),    and each
class has         a separate         form        of numeral        used     with    it,     giving       rise to a fairly     com-     Certain       series    of numeral          words    behave   rather    as adverbs           or independent     verbs

languages having systems of ""numeral classifiers,"" but in Yurok it is the nu
meral word itself that has a different form for nouns of the various classes,
and    not a separate ""classifier.""
      The numeral forms and the noun                        classes        are    set out in the table below,
but it is doubtful whether the full numeral                              system     remains    intact with any
speakers. There appears to be a tendency for the numerals appropriate                                              to
human beings and animals to persist and for the forms used for ""round
things"" to be generalized for nouns of the other classes.                                     The table given
below    was      compiled          from     several     informants            and represents     a collation      of
material from thern all, each accepting,                                though not necessarily volunteer-
ing, all the forms tabulated.","[97, 98, 99]"
"13.221     General and tables
      In the table of the   adjectives        the gaps     are     in many       cases   owing     to the in-
applicability of the particular type of meaning to the particular                              class of
nouns, but in some apparently possible places gaps may indicate the inability
of informants to supply the word, and not necessarily the absence of such a
word in the total word stock of the language.",[105]
"                                                     6. WORDSThe word units set up in this analysis of Yurok are based primarily on syn-
tactical and morphological criteria. Convenient units of relative independence
as elements of sentence structure and abstracted for the grammatical analy-
sis of the language are not delimitable in terms of phonological criteria. Con-
sequently the word unit is not used here as part of the means for establishing
or defining phonemic units. The spaces between words in the examples and
texts are of grammatical rather than phonological significance.
    However, certain phonological features are associated with these gram-
matical word units. Words of more than one syllable are characterized by
an optional slight lengthening of the initial syllable. This lengthening varies
in its occurrence; phonetically it may take the form of a slight lengthening
of the vowel in the syllable, or of a slight lengthening of the first consonant
of the second syllable where this consonant is intervocalic (e.g., tepo:, tree,
[tep-o-]), inwhich case the lengthened consonant may be regarded phonetical-
ly as ambisyllabic,              In many instances both processes                       are employed          in the
same word. Phonemic distinctions of vowel length are not obscured by this
facultative phonetic vowel lengthening. It is in these slightly lengthened ini-
tial syllables of words that e is most commonly pronounced [e¥] (4.2), and
intervocalic         w    as vy)    (4.1),    when occurring as initial consonant of the
second syllable.
   Apart from the            phonologically          nonpermitted             sequences       mentioned       above
(5),    which are excluded by general limitations of Yurok                                  syllable structure,
certain other sequences are excluded from the phonological                                          composition      of
words and can occur only across a word boundary.
       h is never followed immediately within a word by                                ?,    a voiced consonant,
or a glottalized           consonant.    The     effect of this         restriction          is seen     in the   mor-
phology of certain verbs. See 13,141.1F(2), 13.141.1F(3), 13.141.2A(1),
13.142.2. Certain frequently occurring word sequences are found in two dif-
ferent     forms according to speed of utterance; in quicker speech the two
words      are sometimes uttered as one compound, the sequence VhC (where                                                 C
is ?, or a voiced or glottalized consonant) being replaced by VC.",[20]

an important part in Yurok                    sentence structure. Their principal function is
as part of the expansions of verbs into larger endocentric verbal groups. In
such groups they form relatively loosely joined verbal complexes. These
elements are treated as particles, separate words, and not as part of the
morphology of the verb, principally on the ground that their positional occur-
rence in sentences,             though         restricted,                      is not fixed,      whereas the relative
positions of morphological elements in a word are fixed.®> Moreover,                                                         these
particles      may     be disjoined           from     their head                   word      by certain       intervening
words.      Their grammatical                 relations are therefore considered as part of the
syntax      rather    than of the morphology                       of the Yurok                 language.
     Positionally these particles are restricted,                                          except in the constructions
given below in 14.4,            to preceding the verb                              which acts as head of the endo-
centric construction            to which they belong.                              Hence the designation given them.
They may be distinguished from the class of adverbs (15) by reason of the
greater      freedom     of grammatical                relationship                     and    positional      occurrence      en-
joyed by the latter.

82                                         THE      YUROK      LANGUAGE    The basic meaning of the infix is intensity, plurality, or iteration (cf.
its use as a plural formative in nouns, 11.31). In translation its effect has
to be variously rendered, and does not correspond to any one expression
in English.
    The commonest meaning is plurality, intensity, or iteration of the actio:
state, or process denoted by the verb.     cyu:KWen-    to sit                                    cyegu:KWen-    to sit often

negation is intensified.     ten(pewet-)              to rain                      tegen   it often rains, mos           tegen      it

   Besides the plural inflections                           described        above,     there    are   many   verbs   in
 oth the e-class and the o-class which form their plurals by extending their
 tem by a plural increment, which then serves as a base for the inflections.
     The regular increments for e-class verbs are -e?m- and -i?m-, and
 ‘Yr o-class verbs -o'?m- and -u'?m-, each being added after the final
 onsonant of the stem.

dictionary with the final hyphen bracketed.
   Incremental second person plural forms are used indefinitely in the
same manner as nonincremental forms (C. above).       tene?mo?w_                  there is a large crowd (lit., people are                           numerous)

       The        indicative         active      paradigms           of several       verbs        of both        classes     exhibit
certain variant forms, some of which may be grouped into subclasses,
whereas others must be listed separately as irregular verbs.
    (1) a-modifying verbs. Verbs with the vowel « in the final syllable of
the stem are subject to facultative vowel harmony and have alternative
4-modified and unmodified inflections for many of their persons. The two
forms are in free variation, though 1-modified forms were noticeably more
common in connected speech, and unmodified forms predominated in iso-
lated utterance.                    In several cases             a verb with 1-modified forms in a sentence
was      repeated in isolation with unmodified forms.
       The operation of 14-modification is as follows:
       In inflections the vowels                      e and       o are       replaced        by     1;   a does        not       occur
in the inflections                   concerned,            and   i and    u   are     not   subject          to     4s-modification
as a form of vowel harmony                             (9.1).
       The        14-modified         inflections          may    therefore         be set out:       e-class verbs                                                          Second type o-class verbs”’

  e. I! will be noticed that the sequences,  article + third person attrib-
tive + noun,   noun + article + third person attributive verb, and article
 third person attributive verb‘? may be syntactically ambiguous when one
rammatical interpretation of the clause is not ruled out by the linguistic or
ther context.
  Thus     the expressions         ku tmo:lomin peguak and (ku) pegak ku tmo-lomin,
ight mean either ""the man who shot"" or ""the man whom he shot,"" accord-
\g to whether the subject of tmo‘lomin is taken as peg.k or as different
‘om peguk and implied by the inflection of the attributive verb.
  Where the verb is in the first or second person this ambiguity does not
cise; but in the third person a distinction of number between the (implied)
abject of the attributive and the head noun is of little help because                           of the
Most complete absence of formally expressed number in nouns and the
lentity of third person singular and nonincremental third person plural
rms.*>      But the clause ku newo-?moni perey means                         ""the old woman that
ey saw,"" because the verb is plural and the noun singular (11.31).                                  The
urok for ""the old woman who saw (it)"" would be ku newomin perey,                                    and
1r ""the old women        who saw (it)"" ku newo-?moni                  (or newomin)        pegerey.
hese     sentences    might,    however,      in the absence           of contextual      determina-
on,     mean     ""the old woman      he (they) saw""         and     ""the old women they saw.""
  Ambiguity is avoided by expressing the subject, instead of leaving it im-
lied, and in many cases only one grammatical interpretation is contextual-
' possible. Thus the sentence nek komcumek ku so'to?li3 ?0?lei must mean
[ know the house where he has gone,"" with the subject of so-to?li8 implied,
nd not *""I know the house which has gone away"";                          and the sentence ku lekoni
eguk kic ko?1 so?n must mean ""the man who fell down has died,"" with pegak
s head noun and subject of lekoni, and not *""the man where he fell down
as died.""
  An informant pointed out, however, that a phrase of the type ku yo?
ohkWin ?0?le4 would ordinarily be avoided, as it might mean either ""the “Intensive form,      see 13.151;    second plural form used indefinitely,             see 13.141.1E(1).

Attributive paradigm, whose principal syntactic function is the formation
of clauses as endocentric expansions of nouns or as nominal substitute groups

flected verbs have separate forms for each persons, though for certain per-

can be used in similar constructions, the syntactic structure of the sentence
making        clear their function.","[70, 71]"

    Only a very small number of verbs have dual forms distinct from their
plural forms, and in these verbs the plural form may be used with refer-
ence to a dual subject instead of the dual form. Possibly the dual forms
are a survival of a once more widespread category in the grammatical sys-
tem of Yurok.           Only the first and second person dual forms are found. These
correspond to nonincremental plural forms with C or °C in place of the final
consonant of the stem. The distribution of C and ?C is the same as in the
third person       singular indicative of e-class verbs (13.141.1).                          Only the uni-
personal     indicative      and    pronominal          prefix    paradigms       have     dual   forms.","[90, 91]"

    There is not in Yurok a formally differentiated class of words correspond-
ing to the adjectives of English or other European languages, Such words
generally translate into Yurok intransitive                  verbs,         not formally       distinguish-
able from other intransitive verbs.      kimol-    to be bad                             skuyep-            to be   good   There is, however, a small number                     of intransitive verbs which have
broadly similar meanings and different                   forms according to the noun class                    to
which they refer,        in a similar manner          to the numerals,              though the differentia-
tion is less extensive and often only a few forms appear for each meaning.
These verbs are designated the subclass of Adjectives. Syntactically they
behave as the rest of the intransitive verbs. A number of color words are
included in this subclass.","[104, 105]"

tions as the corresponding indicative forms (cf. 13.141.4A), with concord
between subject pronoun and prefix, except for the passive derived forms
(2s.       lpl.,           3s.   lL pl.,   3 pl.        1s.,     2pl.     1 pl.,     3 pl.         1 pl.,   3s.   2 pl.,   3 pl.

the passive verb) and the prefix.     (?)neko? moyoy(ogoh)
     Keko? moyoye?mB.   Secondary set
    In the bipersonal conjugation there is a secondary set of pronominal pre-
fix forms for certain places in the system, in which the concord of person
is between the object pronoun and the prefix in 2s. 1s. and3s.      1s., and
between the subject pronoun and the prefix in the passive derived forms
2s. 1pl., 3s. 1pl.,     2 pl. 1 pl., 3 pl. 1 pl. These secondary forms were
only found in the above places in the system, and appear to be less common
than the corresponding members of the primary set.
    For 3 s. 1s. with object pronoun concord a different final element is
used, -ic instead of -e?n.     o-class           verb      tmo:l-      to shoot     Indic.                                                    Pron.    Pref.      Primary              Secondary

                                             INTRODUCTION
The        Yurok     Indians    live,   as they have       always      lived in their      recorded    history,
near the mouth of the Klamath                    River in Del Norte County in northern Cali-
fornia. From there Yurok territory extends up the river some thirty miles
to include the junction of the Trinity and Klamath rivers, and south along
the coast as far as the neighborhood of Trinidad in Humboldt County. Yurok
dwellings were never far from the sea or a river, and intercommunication
was mainly by water, along the coast or up the Klamath or one of the small-
er rivers. To this day the normal direct route between the upper Klamath
Yurok habitations and the more numerous ones around the river mouth is by
the river.
    The Yurok are bounded on the north by the Tolowa, on the east by the
Karok, on the southeast by the Hupa, and on the south by the Chilula and the
Wiyot; Wiyot territory adjoins Yurok territory at its extreme south coastal
border.
   In common with most languages of northern California, Yurok has been
steadily losing ground to English ever since American penetration of the
Yurok        country began about the middle of the nineteenth century.                           At the pres-
ent time probably not more than twenty persons could claim even a fair
working knowledge of the language, which has ceased to be a channel of nor-
mal communication except perhaps occasionally between very old persons
and the one or two others who may have to talk with them. Beyond this small
number of Yurok speakers, a somewhat larger number of Yurok Indians re-
tain fragments of the language in the form of remembered short sentences
and phrases that they are unable to use as the basis for further discourse; a
still larger number know a few isolated Yurok names for common objects, a
knowledge which, despite its limitation, they sometimes proudly display as
evidence of ""knowing a bit of Indian.""
    The fabric of Yurok culture, described by Kroeber more than a genera-
tion ago,' has now almost entirely disintegrated under the impact of Ameri-
can contacts. The Yurok do not live in a reservation, and though many of
their houses are outside the concentration of white men's houses in the town
of Klamath-the largest inhabited center in the Yurok area-they freely inter-
ming!e and intermarry with white people and take employment beside them
in loc.u. industries,             notably the Klamath timber               mills and the summer           tour-
ist trade.
   The ceremonies and rituals described by Kroeber have been extinct for
some vears. Debased derivatives of one or two Yurok dances have occasion-    1A.           iXtroeber, Handbook of the Indians of California, BAE-B 78:1-97 (Washington,

commercial                 festivities      organized        by   members      of the       white   community          in
Klamath.
       So far as a specific Yurok culture does survive,                              it does so fragmentarily
in the memory of some of the older Yurok, who recall the personal relation-
ships formerly existing between families and members of families. A few of
them are still active and can describe some of the details of the dances and
other ceremonies, sweathouse organization, and the like, and can sing songs
appropriate to certain dances and recount traditional stories and parts of
myths. It was noticeable that among such persons the taboo on the mention
of names of deceased persons, to which Kroeber refers,’ was usually ob-
served strictly.
    Material objects of Yurok culture are to be seen in the ceremonial rega-
lia and other items preserved by a few families and exhibited to the inquirer
with some pride. Yurok houses are now all of American pattern, but one or
two sweathouses and dwellings of traditional type have been partly preserved,
and the sites of others are known and referred to by members of the Indian
community.
    One notable feature of Yurok life has continued quite vigorously under
American patronage, the skillful basket weaving.> Yurok women still weave
baskets, many of them with the old traditional patterns, and these find a
ready sale to tourists and visitors in Klamath.
    The Yurok language has not been securely assigned to any of the larger
linguistic groups of the American continent. Though culturally the Yurok
shared many nonlinguistic features with their neighbors in northwest Cali-
fornia,       and the tribe was described by Kroeber                           as a center of cultural dif-
fusion,* linguistically they are somewhat isolated, and the only suggested
relation with a neighboring language is with Wiyot.® These two languages
were regarded by Sapir as Algonkian, though on relatively slight evidence;
This classification was accepted by Kroeber                               and others,        though it was
strongly attacked by Michelson.®
   On the evidence so far made available                             the question of the Algonkian                 affili-
ation of Yurok must be left undecided,                            though it is to be hoped that the Yurok
material        published           in this volume,          together    with further        researches      into the
Algonkian linguistic family and the comparative                                study of American Indian
languages         generally,           may    throw        some   light on this     problem.","[9, 10, 11, 12]"

      Besides       the Nominal + Verbal type,            sentences of the Equational type are
 formed      of two    nominals      or nominal       groups.      wok   nelet      that is my     sister

   Verbals and verbal groups can occur                     alone,    without    a subject    nominal,
as complete sentences.      tmo'lok    Iam shooting

ing). It has four types of functions:   a. With indicative or noninflected verb forms it is used to make polite
imperative sentences, which are in more general use than the specific im-
perative forms of verbs.      ke?1 co wonu so-ne?m Kerur                          sing higher! (lit., raise your singing! )
      co curpay Kawa?yas we?lep                          comb your girl's hair!
      co? cpinahpipa? ?owo'kpa:    wait for me till the day after tomorrow!
      ku la:s ?0 gunowoni tepo: co ?0:lekWe?m       camp by the tree at the side
          of the road!
      co? toyko:?m Kesa-?agoceK       try to talk Yurok!
      ke?1 co nahcise?m Kew ku ?nu-k_      give your name to my child!
      co 20 go-le+ so-to-?m*    go into the garden!      b.    In clauses             of the form        article    + attributive    verb,        co(?) before        the
verb is the specific mark of temporal                             clauses (cf.       13.141.61(2)f).      ku co     ¢ku:?mo?w_             in the acorn         gathering      season     (lit.,    when   people        regu-
            larly gather acorns)
      ku co plegohpin               ki yegok          I will go when       the waters      are in spate
      Ki nek co hego:loh_                when I go,        when I went
      ku yo?        co?     so’tolin     when         he goes,     when    he went      Without co(?) the last two examples                          might mean         ""where I go,"" etc.
    Occasionally                 co(?) is used with this temporal                meaning        in other     construc-
tions.      kit hego?o0mah co? nu-?mei yo?ikoh       they arrived just as we were mak-
          ing the fires (lit., we were just making the fires then they arrived)
      nek keyoh co ?0°K__I was born in the fall (autumn)    c.  co(?) is often found after kus in interrogative sentences                                      (18.3A),
without any assignable translation meaning.      kus co neskWecok¥                   when did he come?

PHONETIC             DESCRIPTIONS                                                4.1    ConsonantsThe nonglottalized plosives and affricates are voiceless;                                    in syllable final
position they are aspirated except in connected speech, where they may be
unexploded. The glottalization of the glottalized series is never strong, and
in connected speech these consonants are often pronounced with the same
articulation as the corresponding nonglottalized consonants,                                     though the dis-
tinction between the two series is normally maintained in slower speech and
in the utterance of isolated forms. In the examples and texts these conso-
nants are always transcribed as glottalized.’                              It will be seen from the gram-
mar and dictionary that the glottalized consonants play a considerable part
in Yurok morphology, but are relatively infrequent as compared with the
nonglottalized series in the lexicon of the language.
   k and K vary in articulatory position between prevelar and postvelar ac-
cording to the frontness or backness of the adjacent vowels, particularly the
vowel in the same syllable. In syllable final position after e or i, k and K
may be released with a slight Y-offglide.    kahkah_          sturgeon                                 Ki     the

arrangements give different meanings. In most groups                                    the meaning can be
seen from an examination of the meanings                              attributable to the constituent
particles (with the reservation made in 14.2, above). But there are some
groups with a specific meaning or grammatical function not easily derivable
from the uses of the member particles; such groups are described as they
occur below.                 Only      certain particles enter into groups.","[123, 124]"

   The agent or instrument of a passive verb is usually preceded by the
preposition nei. See 16.2F(1) and 16.2F(2).         nek kic teykelowomoyek me? leyes_   I have been bitten by a snake

         niki cu 70 #?uci?     we hit bottom all the way13.141.4           Pronominal         prefixesA. All verbs, active and passive, have pronominal prefix forms, in which
the pronominal prefixes described in 11.35 and following, under Nominals,
are added to verb stems.
    The prefix forms are subject to the same rules of distribution and vowel
harmony as with nouns, but verbs whose stems begin hVg- do not have ?
before the g in their pronominal                     prefix forms          as do nouns of that class.                See
11.353.
         The   personal       inflections       in inflected verbs         in this     paradigm         are    the same
as the first person singular indicative for all three persons                                     in the singular,
and the same               as the corresponding         three       personal        inflections    of the indica-

    Syntactically the various categories of the bipersonal conjugation behave
in a similar manner to those of the unipersonal conjugation.
    With verbs meaning ""to give"" and the like the indirect object is incorpor-
ated in the verb, not the direct object.     nek    nahciseK    ci-k          I gave     him    money    The object       pronoun          of a biperosnal           verb       may     be expressed       separately     in
the sentence.     nek newocek       or         nek newoceKk ke?l               I see you
     kiti kimkoseK           or     kiti kimkoseK         yo?       I shall       punish him
     nek nahcisek   I give it to him
     nek nahciseK ku cey I give it to the child     Passive     derived          forms      enter     into the same             syntactic   constructions.     yo? nowkWoy             he looks after us
     neto‘?mar kelac nimi Kenrokseye?m     my friends                                    do not trust you
     yo?tkoh nekah sumayiway    they will kill us
     yo?tkoh kelac ?ohpele?m_                     they will give it to you     This    construction           may      be derived     from       the       sentence    type   described   in
the second paragraph of 13.141.3J.
    Forms that are identical with those of the unipersonal                                     conjugation always
have the object expressed, unless the context makes it unnecessary.
    The third person object forms (1 s. 3s., 2s. 3s., 1 pl. 38s., 2pl. 38.,
1s. 3 pl.) are only used when the object refers to a human being; otherwise
unipersonal forms are used. One informant contrasted the sentences nek
kemeyonemesek,             I will take him home                   (e.g.,     a child) with nek kemeyonemek
yo?, I will take him home, used with reference to a human being when he is
incapable of resistance or action normal to a human being (e.g., a person
drunk, ill, or injured). For this informant there was a stylistic effect in
using a form appropriate to an animal or an inanimate object when the ob-
ject was in fact a human being.
    It was, however, quite common,    particularly with informants having less
command of the language,     for unipersonal forms to be substituted for
specific bipersonal forms or passive derived forms without any observed
stylistic effect.     yo? kelac 90 no-?rep                    he followed you there
     nekah    skewoksimoh              yo?       we    like himA.  Pronominal prefix forms
   The bipersonal pronominal prefix forms                                  are    used   in similar    constructions
to those of the unipersonal conjugation.
