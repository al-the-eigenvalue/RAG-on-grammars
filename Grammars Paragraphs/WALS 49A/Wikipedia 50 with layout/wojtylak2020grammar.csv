6.4   Summary
Generally, Murui has two mechanisms to distinguish syntactic functions of the corearguments in Murui: the morphological mechanism (i.e. the overt case marking on S/A and Oarguments) (discussed in §6.2), and the syntactic mechanism (i.e. if the grammatical markingis absent, the constituent order in which NPs occurs in relation to the predicate) (§6.3). Muruihas a nominative-accusative case marking system, and distinguishes between core andoblique arguments. The core arguments, the subject S/A and the non-subject O are subject todifferential case marking. Core arguments can also be marked for the locative/dative case,which can be omitted with pronouns. In Murui, it is the discourse status of the S/A and Oarguments (including their topicality and specificity) that determines whether they receive thecase markers. In addition to the core cases in the language, there are five oblique cases inMurui: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-casual, and privative. Each has a numberof specific functions and meanings. Oblique cases do not co-occur with core-cases in a singleNP; an exception might be the ablative. The overview of core and oblique cases is given inTable 6.3. Murui has a nominative-accusative pattern of constituent ordering – S, A followedby O, occur before the V. The constituent order, however, allows certain flexibility.

7 Predicate structure, non-spatial, and spatial settingThis chapter covers the grammatical expression of non-spatial setting and spatial setting inMurui. The structure of a Murui predicate is discussed in §7.1. This is followed by thedescription of Murui non-spatial setting in §7.2: the grammatical categories which expressthe timing of activity (see §7.2.1 on tense), the internal composition of activity (aspect,§7.2.2), speaker’s attitudes towards the event (modality, §7.2.3), as well as those categorieswhich provide information about the source of acquired knowledge (evidentiality andepistemic modality, §7.2.4). Spatial setting (i.e. direction and location expressed with affixeson verb), the andative and ventive, are discussed in §7.3. The last section §7.4 offers a briefsummary.","[339, 340, 341, 342]"

various semantic and syntactic functions (see also §6.2.1.6 on differential case marking withthe dative/locative -mo, and a clause linking device, see §12.3.1). Murui oblique case markersnever co-occur with the core-case markers (with the ablative being the only exception, see§6.2.2.2 for details). The only case marker that can be omitted under specific pragmaticconditions is the locative (see (6.110-6.111) in §6.2.1.1).","[324, 325]"

3.1   Open word classes
Open word classes are nouns, verbs, and adjectives. All three word classes are distinctlydifferent in their derivational possibilities and functional slots available. Nouns occurprimarily as heads of NPs, and can also function as heads of intransitive predicates. They takea distinctive nominal morphology that includes case and plural marking. The class of Muruinouns is discussed in §3.1.1. Verbs take verbal morphology and function as heads ofpredicates of all types. They are subject to valency-reducing (passive, see §8.1) andincreasing processes (causative and double causative, §8.2). Murui verbs are the topic of§3.1.2. In terms of their morphosyntactic properties, adjectives form a separate class inMurui. They share grammatical categories with both verbs (i.e. they can function as heads ofintransitive predicates, but occur with a limited number of verbal markers) and nouns (theycan take nominal morphology and function as modifiers within an NP). Murui adjectives arediscussed in §3.1.3. Section §3.1.4 discusses word class-changing morphological derivationsthat involve open word classes. Table 3.4 in §3.4 summarizes the properties of open, semi-closed, and closed word classes.
                                                                                                                 117
3.1.1      NounsPrototypical Murui nouns are heads of NPs that function as arguments of a predicate; theycan also function as heads of intransitive predicates. Nouns distinguish the followinggrammatical categories: classifiers (including animate classifiers, which distinguish naturalgender, feminine and masculine; classifiers are discussed in Chapter 4), number (plural andcollective, see §5.2), and case (topical S/A, non-S/A markers, locative, ablative, instrumental,benefactive-causal, and privative, see Chapter 6). 91 All hese grammatical categories areexpressed with bound forms. An example of a noun with all positions filled is given in (3.1):
(3.1) oogo-do-nɨaɨ-do
      banana-CLF:POINTED-COLL-INS
      ‘by/with the bananas’
Depending on the type of noun, classifiers may or may not be obligatory. The category ofnumber is always optional. Case marking is obligatory (but see §6.2 on differential casemarking).","[141, 142]"
"           In terms of language structure, Murui is nominative-accusative with head marking (onthe verb) and some elements of dependent marking (case). The language is largelyagglutinating, suffixing with some fusion. Murui has no prefixes, which distinguishes it fromother Witotoan languages (Fagua Rincón & Seifart, 2010; Wojtylak, 2016d). 3 Constituentorder within a clause is frequently determined by pragmatic factors but there is a tendency forit to be predicate final (SV/AOV).",[29]
"           Murui has three open lexical word classes: nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Semi-closedword classes are adverbs, time words, and number words. There are seven closed wordclasses; these are quantifiers and intensifiers, pronouns, demonstratives, interrogative contentwords, the connective ie, adpositions, and interjections. Murui word classes share numerousproperties; for instance, many of the members of the open, semi-closed, and closed wordclasses can be used as heads of intransitive predicates. For instance, in (1.1), the head of thepredicate is the verb ɨba(de) ‘buy’; in (1.2) it is the noun uzuma ‘grandfather’; in (1.3) it is

    With regards to the lack of tonal distinction, all ‘Witoto’ dialects are similar to Nonuya but are unlike Ocaina
and other languages of the People of the Centre cultural area. Note however that only Murui and Mɨka have
fixed accent position (word-initial). Mɨnɨka and Nɨpode appear to have different patterns of accent placement.
This has lead other researchers to hypothesize that it could possibly be indicative of tonal contrasts in Mɨnɨka
(Ávila, 2016; Seifart & Fagua Rincón, 2009).

    Witotoan languages differ in terms of the number of prefixes on the verb (Wojtylak, 2016d).

headed by the question word buu ‘who’. Murui open, semi-closed, and closed word classes,as well as word-changing derivations are discussed in Chapter 3.

        ‘Who are you (two males)?’Murui nouns can take up to three suffix slots that generally can be filled simultaneously withclassifiers (up to three classifier positions), number (plural, kinship plural, and collective),and case marking (topical S/A and non-S/A subject markers, locative, ablative, instrumental,benefactive-causal, and privative) (see Chapter 6 on grammatical relations). The non-singularity of plain noun forms is often determined by context. Often, number marking isexpressed when nouns are pragmatically salient or their referents are highly animate. Perhapsone of the most salient features of Murui, is its large multiple classifier system, that consistsof more than 80 ‘established’ classifiers that denote among others, form, size, function, andquantification. In this respect, Murui is similar to other neighboring languages spoken in theCaquetá-Putumayo region as well as those languages spoken in the vicinity of the Vaupéslinguistic area to the north (among which the East Tucanoan and Makú languages, as well asan Arawak language, Tariana) (Aikhenvald, 2000: 204-241; Seifart, 2005). A few examplesof Murui classifiers are given in (1.4) (classifiers are in bold).
(1.4)   small, round in form e.g. komai-jɨ ‘seed of milpeso tree (Mauritia flexuosa)’
                                  jiñi-jɨ   ‘testicles’
        tree-like form       e.g. ñekɨ-na ‘chambira tree (Astrocaryum chambira)’
                                  zirɨko-na ‘grape tree’
                                                                                               6
The classifiers are suffixes that can be defined as sets of morphemes used in variousmorphosyntactic contexts, including demonstratives, pronouns, and adjectives, as illustratedin (1.5):
(1.5)   bi-koVCS               kue-ɨeVCC kue-koVCS          mare-koVCC
        this.CTS-CLF:COVER 1sg-GEN 1sg-CLF:COVER good.ATT-CLF:COVER
        ‘This (house) is mine. My (house) is a good (house).’
The Murui multiple classifier system is semi-open due to the occurrence of repeaters whichcan be defined as partially repeated nouns that do not classify nouns but occur in the classifierslot. They have non-human referents only. In (1.6) -dora is ‘repeated’ from the Spanish formkomputadora for ‘computer’ on the pronoun oo ‘you (2sg)’:
(1.6)   baa!     oo-doraS                     i-ñe-d-e=taPRED
        THERE   2sg-CLF.REP:COMPUTER.Sp exist-NEG-LK-3=REP
        ‘There! Your (computer) is gone! (reportedly)’
Murui repeaters are similar to repeaters in other neighboring languages (Aikhenvald, 2000:222). The main functions of Murui classifiers are derivation of nominal stems, formation of‘headless’ nominal modifiers, and word-class changing nominalizations. They also functionas a reference-tracking mechanism (Wojtylak, 2016a, forthcoming-d). See Chapter 4 onMurui noun structure and classifiers.","[29, 30, 31]"
"Compare the following examples (6.78) and (6.79). In (6.78) the referent is not topical; it isany girl I delivered, there is no relationship between me and the girl. In (6.79), it is a childdelivered by a medicine man. According to Sandriela Agga, it is not just a child. The child isimportant; it is part of the medicine man’s family. The expression has some kind ofendearment reading to it.

E. POSITION OF THE NP ON THE NOMINAL HIERARCHY – case marking of an O NP does notseem to play any significant role in differential subject marking (but see the marking of O NPwith the dative/lovative -mo in §6.2.1.6). Pronouns with both animate and inanimate referentscan be both marked and unmarked. An example of a marked pronoun is shown in (6.80). Foran example of an unmarked pronoun oo (2sg) ‘you’ see T2.26 in the Appendix.

As (6.103) shows, such constructions allow marking the case twice with a clause. The first ONP is always obligatorily marked with -na, the marking of the second O NP can be omittedbut it is usually present (see §8.2).
                                                                                                           299
6.2.2      Oblique argumentsOblique cases mark any non-core arguments and their marking cannot be omitted. Muruidistinguishes between five oblique cases: locative, ablative, instrumental (with comitativeovertones), benefactive-causal and privative. There is also a genitive form, which is notstrictly a case as it marks relations within the NP rather than grammatical relations (see§5.1.1.2). All nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers distinguish oblique cases. Adverbialdemonstratives that take the suffix -ne (see §3.3.3) are unique in that they show limited casemarking possibilities, as well as differ in terms of locative and ablative marking. Thenominalizations are unique in that their privative forms can either be -(ñe)no or-(ni)no (see §10.2.5), whereas the privative is marked with -(ni)no elsewhere (see §6.2.2.5 fordetails). The most restricted case is the privative marking. Murui lexicalized adverbialdemonstratives that contain the formative -ne (see §3.3.3) occurs with the ablative and theinstrumental only. Murui oblique cases are presented in Table 6.2.","[323, 324]"

In the text, vernacular data is given in italics. Examples are numbered according to the
Chapter they are in (e.g. example ‘(1.5)’ refers to Chapter 1, example 5). Examples have
three lines. The first line is orthographic and breaks up each word into morphemes. The
second line shows morpheme-level glosses. SMALL CAPS are used for grammatical glosses.
Proper names are reproduced throughout the glossing. The final line provides a free
translation into English. The free translations are as idiomatic as possible; parentheses
complement contextual meaning of the free translations. If an example is to be found in the
text in the Appendix, it is marked with ‘TextNumber.SentenceNumber’, as in (T3.3).
      In the text, verbs are given in a citation form, where the predicate marker (-dɨ/-tɨ) is
followed by the 3rd person pronominal subject marker -e. For instance, the verb ‘write’ is
presented as kue(te) ‘write’, where kue- is a verbal root. Punctuation depend on the pauses in
speaker’s speech after the sentence is considered to have been completed. Clauses and
sentences are not capitalized. When one word has several different meanings, the most
appropriate one is given in the gloss. ‘Headless’ nominal modifiers that are used as heads of
intransitive predicates are often shown in brackets to indicate non-verbal forms used
intransitively, e.g. [mare-ko]-d-e (good.ATT-CLF.REP.DOG-LK-3) ‘it’s a good (dog)’.
      The quotation marks placed around the term Witoto are done at the request of the
Murui, Mɨnɨka, Mɨka, and Nɨpode people. ‘Witoto’ subsumed these four separate groups. The
term Witotoan refers to the language family (that consists of ‘Witoto’, Ocaina, and Nonuya).
      Throughout the chapters, there are a few numbering gaps, as some examples were
eliminated in the final stage of the revision process.

1 The Murui language and its speakersMurui, also known in literature as Búe, Uitoto, Witoto, and Huitoto, belongs to the Witotoanlanguage family, one of the smaller linguistic families in Amazonia, that consists of two otherlanguages spoken in the area, Ocaina (still spoken by about 90 people) and Nonuya (amoribund language). Murui is spoken by about 2,000 people that traditionally inhabited theregion of the Amazon Basin between the middle sections of the Caquetá and Putumayo riversin Colombia and their tributaries, the Igara-Paraná and Cara-Paraná rivers. Today, smallerMurui tribes live also ‘outside’ the Caquetá-Putumayo region. There is a mixed communityof Murui-Mɨnɨka people located in the Resguardo Indígena Tikuna-Uitoto (known as‘Kilómetro 11’) close to Leticia (Colombia). Some also inhabit areas along the Ampi-Yacúand Napo rivers in Peru (see e.g. Petersen de Piñeros and Patiño Rosselli (2000: 219)).","[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"

B4. THE STRUCTURE OF ‘HEADLESS’ NOMINAL MODIFIERS WITH ADJECTIVES IS THE SAME ASTHAT OF OTHER ‘HEADLESS’ NOMINAL MODIFIERS – ‘headless’ nominal modifiers which makeup a complete NP in Murui, are formed from other word classes (nouns and noun roots,adjectives, pronouns, as well as number, demonstrative, and interrogative roots) by means ofclassifiers (see §4.2.1), e.g. jano-kae (small-CLF.REP:CANOE) ‘little (canoe)’. They takenominal morphology that includes plural/collective and case marking. In such structures,classifiers are directly suffixed to nominal roots. Verbal and adjectival roots require a linkerposition to be able to take on a classifier, e.g. maka-dɨ-mɨe (walk-LK-CLF:PR.M) ‘(male) whowalks’.",[435]
"
A. CASUAL ‘BECAUSE OF’ – meaning ‘because of’, e.g.:
(6.153) nokɨ-ri             jo-fo-moLOC                         fɨebi-dɨ-kuePRED

        ‘Because of the rain, I stayed home.’
207
      Abɨdo is possibly related to abɨ ‘body’ (followed by the instrumental case marker -do) (see (T1.21) in the
Appendix). It frequently co-occurs with dane ‘once’, as in abɨdo dane ‘once again’.

B. BENEFACTIVE ‘FOR, FOR BENEFIT OF’ WITH PRONOUNS – in their benefactive meaning, -riimplies that the referent of the noun receives the benefit of the situation expressed by theclause. The causal and benefactive meanings are related - benefactive readings do alsoinvolve causal relationship. This is illustrated in (6.158). Such examples are rare in Murui,however - while some speakers do use -ri with pronouns, others do not. Murui speakersassign such usage to the Mɨnɨka variety, and frequently give benefactive reading in clausesthat contain with fakai ‘time’, as in (6.159).
(6.158) kue-ri             ɨba-it-ePRED
        1sg-BENEF.CAUS buy-FUT.LK-3
        ‘(He) will buy (it) for me.’

While the use of -ri with 1st person singular is debatable among speakers, -ri with 1st personplural, as in (6.160), is widely recognized. 208 What is interesting about (6.160) is that theclause might have two different interpretations, each depending on a situation. If a speakerutters it when the referent is present (e.g. during a gathering), it has positive connotations andis understood as ‘(He) speaks for (the benefit of) us.’. If the referent is not present, themeaning is negative, as in (6.160):
(6.160) kaɨ-ri            ñaɨ-t-ePRED
        1pl-BENEF.CAUS speak-LK-3
        ‘(He) speaks for (benefit of) us.’ or ‘(He) speaks (to cause misfortune) for us.’
6.2.2.5 PrivativeMurui nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers can take the case marker -(ni)no meaning‘without’. The marker -(ni)no is in fact a combination of the negative attributive -ni followedby the privative -no. Such privative clauses always share the same subject. Examples aregiven in (6.161-163):
(6.161) nai-mɨe              [nana atava]S feka-kaPRED         ie=ta

The marker can also occur on verbs and adjectives in the form of -(ni)no or -(ñe)no (cf. theform of the standard negator is -ñe). 209 The privative -no has to co-occur with either thenegative attributive -ni, as in examples (6.161-163) above, or the standard negator -ñe, as in(6.164) (see also §10.2.3-4).(6.164) maɨjɨ-ñe-no     bi-tɨ-kuePRED

6.3       Order of arguments
Grammatical relations in Murui are shown by the order of core arguments in relation to thepredicate: SV and AOV. Murui shows a nominative-accusative pattern of constituentordering – S, A followed by O, occur before the verb. The placement of the non-corearguments follows the nominative–accusative nature of Murui: SXV and AOXV. Obliquearguments are obligatorily marked with cases (see §6.2.2.1 on the occasional omission of thelocative). (6.165) illustrates an intransitive clause with the oblique argument San Rafaelmo‘to San Rafael’ following the S argument. (6.166) is an example of a transitive clause withthe O following the A.","[334, 335, 336, 337]"
"Ethymologically, the 3rd person dual masculine and feminine are cases of double marking (cf.the plural marker -aɨ, see §5.2). 124 Interestingly, the 3rd person dual masculine and feminineforms can occur with the number word da- ‘one (lit. alone)’ (cf. §3.2.3). With the firstsyllable being monophthongized, the forms are daɨmaiaɨ ‘(only) they two (males or a maleand a female) and daɨñuaɨ ‘(only) they two (females)’. In the everyday speech, the 3rd personsingular feminine form -ñaiño can also be used as free forms ñaiño and naiño. 125 Thephonological reduction can occur also with the 3rd person masculine dual. In rapid speech
123
      Oo-re (2sg-ATTENTION) frequently precedes the noun moo ‘father’. Oore (moo) has honorific readings (see
examples T4.2, T4.11, and T4.15 in the Appendix).
124
      Occasionally speakers omit the first instance of the plural marker -aɨ. In such cases, the 3rd person dual
masculine and feminine have forms -maiaɨ and -ñuaɨ.
125
      Ñaiño and naiño are glossed as CLF:PR.F. Note that the ‘derivational’ animate classifiers -ño and -ma can
occur as free forms ñoo and mɨɨ (CLF:DR.F and CLF:DR.M) as endearment forms for the family members of the
same sex as ego. Interestingly, the form mɨɨ undergoes vowel centralization here, a process which is very
common elsewhere in the language, e.g. distance calls and in songs (see §2.5.1).
                                                                                                                 156
-aɨmaiaɨ is sometimes pronounced as -aɨmɨe (see example (7.33) in §7.2.2.2). 126            Independent pronouns and verbal cross-referencing suffixes share the same forms forall persons. Unless animacy, gender, and number are important in the context, the 3rd personis always cross-referenced with the pronominal subject marker -e (cf. Table 7.1 in §7.1). This3rd person cross-referencing suffix, used for low animate and inanimate referents, has theform of the generic classifier -e. This indicates that the person system is based on theopposition 1st and 2nd person (which are pronouns) vs. 3rd person (which are in fact noun-likeforms which contain classifiers as derivational devices). That the 3rd person forms aredifferent morphologically from the first and the 2nd person pronouns is shown by theirmorphosyntactic behaviour:
A. The 1st and 2nd person, which are SAP, and 3rd person (non-SAP) do not form oneparadigm. The 1st and the 2nd person pronouns can be suffixed with the 3rd person boundforms (that is, the 3rd person pronoun forms behave in the same manner as other classifiers),but not the other way around. For instance, the 1st person plural kaɨ can take the 3rd personplural -makɨ, as in kaɨ-makɨ (1pl-CLF:PR.GR.AN) ‘us (our people, group)’. Kaɨmakɨ can also beexpressed by a noun phrase kaɨ-zie i-makɨ (1pl-CLF:CLAN ANA.NSP-CLF:PR.GR.AN) ‘member ofour clan (lit. group of our clan)’.","[180, 181]"

Pronouns marked with the genitive -ɨe and the connective ie cannot function as modifierswithin an NP. 1st and 2nd person pronouns function similarly to nouns with somewhat limitedpossibilities (they cannot take number marking), and, as such, they can head an intransitivepredicate and occur as arguments of a predicate. In (5.30-32) further this section, they arecase-marked and occur as arguments of a predicate. In (5.21-22) they function as argumentsof a verbless clause. Additionally, in (5.22) the pronoun oo ‘you (2sg)’ followed by thegenitive -ɨe heads a predicate.

The 3rd person pronouns (similarly to other nouns in such position) obligatorily receive theconnective ie that follows the R, as in (5.23). This principle is the same as marking any nounor NP in verbless constructions with a possessive form (see §5.1.3.3).

3rd person pronouns, which are in fact classifiers, can follow 1st and 2nd person pronouns (see§3.3.2 and §4.2.2.2). Some examples are given in (5.24-27) below. ‘Headless’ nominalmodifiers formed from pronouns by means of ‘pronominal’ animate classifiers are discussedin §5.1.1.3.

Kaɨmakɨ in (5.25) is a frequent way to refer to a group of Murui excluding non-Murui. Kaɨhas inclusive overtones in the language and is frequently used during celebrations in thecommunal roundhouses when addressing the crowd. Note -makɨ is fairly restricted, that is, itcannot occur on nouns (many classifiers do have such functions, see §4.2.2.2). Compare(5.28a-b) and (5.29a-b), and note the ungrammaticality of (5.28c-29c). 173

      The morpheme -makɨ is also a pronominal subject marker on verbs (see §4.2.2.2).
                                                                                                                  244
1st and 2nd person pronouns marked with the genitive -ɨe can occur as arguments of predicateand take case marking, the topical non-S/A subject marker -na, the locative -mo, and theinstrumental -do markers, as in (5.30-32). For 3rd person pronouns, as shown in (5.33), thecase marker occurs on the connective ie, as in (5.34), not on the pronoun itself. 174

Under specific pragmatic conditions, the ordering of VCS - VCC can be reversed. This has todo with putting extra emphasis on the constituent in that position. 175 Compare (5.21-22)above with (5.35d) below. (5.35) is an excerpt from an argument between two angry sisters.

                no.Sp 1sg   mother
                ‘No! My mother!’
174
      In the Mɨnɨka variety it is also possible to add the benefactive-causal case marker -ri to pronouns that take the
genitive -ɨe, e.g. kue-ɨe-ri fuiri-dɨ-makɨ (1sg-GEN-BENEF.CAUS fight-LK-3pl) ‘they fought for (something) mine’.
In Murui only kue-ri (1sg-BENEF.CAUS) ‘for me’ is appears to be possible in such constructions (see §6.2.2.4).
175
      It is similar to the emphasis in the highly marked VCC-VCS constituent order (§6.3).
                                                                                                          245

                1sg-GEN mother
                ‘MY (!) mother! (lit. mine - mother)’
Generally, pronouns marked with -ɨe cannot function as modifiers within an NP. However, onrare occasions young Murui use them as modifying elements. Such usage has overtones ofbeing angry and annoyed. This is somewhat similar to putting emphasis on a constituentwithin the NP. An example is presented in (5.36). 176
(5.36) [oo-ɨe  ɨfo-gɨ]S                 maraiñe-d-e!PRED
       2sg-GEN head-CLF:OVAL.BIGGER good.ATT.NEG-LK-3
       ‘YOUR head is not good!’ (a young man shouting at his brother)
Murui elders do not approve of such constructions and correct them with sentences such as(5.37). In (5.37) is ooɨe ‘yours’ is in the S function.
(5.37) oo-ɨeS      maraiñe-d-ePRED
       2sg-GEN good.ATT.NEG-LK-3
       ‘Yours is not good.’
Nowadays among the speakers of Murui, there is a lot of code switching between Spanishand Murui. One such example is presented in (5.38) where the possessive NP structure jofode Elger ‘house of Elger’ is taken over from Spanish and included into the Murui clause.
(5.38) [jo-fo           de      Elger]NP jano-ko
       house-CLF:CAV of.Sp Elger          small-CLF:COVER

       ‘The house of Elger is too small for celebrations (lit. house of Elger - small (house)
       for future celebrations).’
176
      Constructions such as (5.36) might also be analyzed as simple appositions, perhaps as an emphatic
construction of sorts, oo-ɨe - ɨfo-gɨ maraiñede meaning ‘yours, head is not good!’.
                                                                                              246
5.1.1.3 Pronouns and classifiersAn alternative way of expressing possession is with classifier constructions. Murui has amultiple classifier system where classifier and repeaters (partially repeated nouns for whichno classifier exist) occur in numerous morphosyntactic contexts (see §4.2). In Murui, if apossessed noun is to be focused on (and it is retrievable from the context), the head noun isomitted, and the pronoun (for the 1st and 2nd person) takes a classifier or a repeater. In suchconstructions, pronouns function as R while classifiers have the D function. Such structuresare similar to those illustrated in (5.24-27). ‘Derivational’ animate classifiers never occur insuch positions (see §4.2.2.2). Examples of physical property classifiers and repeaters aregiven in (5.39-41) below.
(5.39) koko-rui
       1du.m-CLF:DAY
       ‘our (day)’ (two men referring to their birthday)
(5.40) kaɨ-ko
       1pl-CLF.REP:DOG
       ‘our (dog)’ (cf. jɨko ‘dog’)
(5.41) omoɨ-dora
       2pl-CLF.REP:RECORDER.Sp
       ‘your (recorder)’ (cf. grabadora (Sp.) ‘recorder’)
Pronouns that take the genitive -ɨe cannot take other classifiers. Classifier stacking structureswith -ɨe, such as *koko-ɨe-rui (1du.m-GEN-CLF:DAY) intended for ‘my day’, areungrammatical. An NP can contain a pronoun marked with the genitive -ɨe only if it isfollowed by a head noun. Such constructions have emphatic readings (see also §4.4 for thepossible origin of the classifier stacking structures). This is illustrated in (5.42):
(5.42) [koko-ɨe     i-rui]NP
       1du.m-GEN ANA.NSP-CLF:DAY
       ‘MY day (lit. mine - any (day))’
                                                                                              247
In Murui, constructions that allow classifier stacking are limited. For instance, animatereferents are never used in the classifier slot. Apposition within an NP is the only way toexpress the possessive relation between ‘Walter’ and ‘hill’ in (5.43).","[267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272]"

The root in position 1 can be preceded by pronouns (to refer to the possessor, see §3.3.2 and§5.1) which can occur as phonologically independent words in normal and slow speech, orproclitics in rapid speech, e.g. kue jɨko [ˈkue ˈhɨko] or kue=jɨko [ˈkweˌhɨko] for ‘my dog’ (see§2.1.3.3). The root can be followed classifiers in position 2. Usually there is just oneclassifier for nouns for human referents. Such nouns take gender-sensitive animate classifiers-ma (masculine) and -ño (feminine), as in evu-ño (sister-CLF:DR.F) ‘sister’. On nouns withinanimate referents, up to three classifier positions can be filled simultaneously, as e.g. ñekɨ-na (chambira-CLF:TREE) ‘chambira palm tree’, ɨfo-gɨ-tɨraɨ (head-CLF:OVAL-CLF:FUR) ‘headhair’. Generally, nouns do not allow variable ordering of suffixes, but in a few cases re-

ordering of classifiers results in a meaning difference (see §4.4).","[143, 144]"

A. INSTRUMENTAL WITH INSTRUMENTAL READINGS -do – Murui instrumental has a number ofmeanings: ‘by means of’ and ‘by, through, on’. Instrumental marking occurs on nouns and‘headless’ nominal modifiers, but not on personal pronouns. Instrumental ‘by means of’encodes a meaning where a noun is either an instrument, material, or means by, or withwhich the subject achieves or accomplishes an action, as in (6.136-138).

B. INSTRUMENTAL WITH COMITATIVE READINGS ‒ the case marker -do can have bothinstrumental as well as comitative readings ‘with help of, assistance of, together with’marking a referent that is assisting in an action to be completed or carried out. They can occuron nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers, and pronouns. An example of -do occurring on anoun with an inanimate referent in (6.143), on a noun with animate referents in (6.144-145),an interrogative content word in (6.146), and a pronoun in (6.145). Its usage on pronouns,however, is sparse even among older speakers of Murui.

This instrumental has always overtones of help being included and cannot be interpreted assimply ‘together with’. For instance, in (6.145) a daughter came together with the speakerbut, at the same time, she also helped him to come by leading the way. Note that Murui hasalso the postposition dɨga for purely comitative meanings ‘with, together with’, as in (6.148-149) (see also §3.3.3.6 on adpositions).

C. SPECIAL READINGS OF -do WITH PRONOUNS AND THE VERB ‘come’ ‒ in addition to theinstrumental meanings, the marker -do on pronouns can have a special reading that is neitherinstrumental nor comitative, but some type of similative reading. This is illustrated in (6.150-
                                                                                                                   309

D. FOSSILISED EXPRESSIONS – on a handful of nouns, the meaning of the instrumental is nolonger transparent. There is one fossilized adverbial expression in Murui that frequentlyoccurs with the instrumental case marker abɨdo meaning ‘again’, as in (6.152): 207

"
6.2.1       Core argumentsThe marking of syntactic function of the core arguments S/A and O is dependent on discourseproperties of core constituents. The marking of the core arguments is summarized in Table6.1. The term ‘topical’ refers to S/A and O arguments that are topical in discourse. 190

      Murui has a focus marker -ka on pronouns, as in: kue-ka jaie=koni raotɨkue (1sg-FOC PAST=LOC hunt-LK-
1sg) ‘Long time ago (when I was young) I used to hunt (a lot).’ The focus marker -ka is VERY RARE and occurs
only in the speech of the elders. Petersen de Piñeros (2004: 150) gives some examples of -ka in Mɨka, as in buu-
ka fɨno-dɨ (who-FOC do-LK) ‘who is it who did this?’ (note the omission of the pronominal subject markers on
the verbs). The focus marker -ka is homophonous with the passive marker -ka/-ga.

Unlike  a prototypical object, a prototypical transitive subject is recognized as being in the A function  if it is “(…) that argument whose referent could initiate or control the activity (if anything  could)” (Dixon, 2010b: 76). There are a number of morphological and syntactic criteria in  Murui that identify the subjecthood of S and A arguments:
  A. Verbal suffixes cross-reference the subject (S/A) on the predicate, e.g.:
  (6.6) dɨno=koni                 kokoS bɨta-da-tɨ-kokoPRED
        AT.CLF:SP.PLACE=LOCAL1    1du.m lie.on.ground.TH-BODY-LK-1du.m

        ANA.SP-CLF:PR.M 1sg       sleep-CAUS-LK-3
        ‘He made me fall asleep.’
  Murui nouns are usually not marked for number if the plural reference is retrievable from the  context (see §5.2). The form of the 3rd person pronominal subject marking is always -e  expressing any kind of singular or plural meanings. In (6.8) the marker -e expresses the  group’s plurality of uzutɨaɨ ‘grandfathers’. When the animacy of S/A NP is emphasized and  the argument is individualized, the predicate takes 3rd dual and plural pronominal subject  markers, as in (6.9).

B. An NP that functions as S/A subject, can be either zero-marked or it can take the enclitic=dɨ. O arguments are never marked with =dɨ. In (6.10), jɨko ‘dog’ is in contrastive focus (thefactors conditioning the S/A focus marking are outlined in §6.2.1.2):
(6.10) gatoS    bi-ñe-d-ePRED        jɨko=dɨS       bi-yaPRED
       cat.Sp come-NEG-LK-3 dog=S/A.TOP come-E.NMLZ
       ‘It was not the cat that came. It was the dog (lit. A cat didn’t come. The dog came.)’
C. The typical constituent order is SV and AOV where the S and A arguments are pre-posedto the clause-final predicate. In the transitive clause of the AOV type, the placement of the Oargument is restricted and O cannot precede the A NP argument, unless it is marked for thetopical non-S/A subject case. Compare (6.11a) (with the AOV constituent order and no overtcase marking) with (6.11b) (with the AVO constituent order and the overt case marking). In(6.11b), akiena ‘this’ is topical.

D. Murui has the S/A pivot where the S and A arguments are a common argument of twolinked clauses (so-called the ‘nominative-accusative’ S/A pivot), as in (6.12):
(6.12) PedroA nai-ñaiño-naO                 kɨo-d-ePRED                 ØS jakɨ-nai-t-ePRED

       ‘Pedro saw her (and he) got scared.’
E. In addition to the criteria for recognition of the S/A subject outlined above, there are alsomore associations between the S and A arguments. In Murui, the referent of both S and A is2nd person in canonical imperative constructions (see §11.1). 191 Usually, the S and Aarguments are not explicitly stated, and they are understood from the context. The imperativein (6.13) below is an example of an intransitive clause where the S argument is not stated.","[297, 298, 299, 300]"
"An example of a classifier used on an adjective is presented in (3.4), which is a functionalequivalent of (3.3) above. ‘Headless’ nominal modifiers used in such a way share syntacticfunctions and grammatical categories with prototypical nouns (classifiers, number, and case).",[145]

The overt presence of the case markers on S/A arguments and O arguments is subject todifferential case marking and is related to the discourse status of a referent. Under specialpragmatic conditions:
       ‒ S/A arguments can be either unmarked or marked with the topical enclitic =dɨ,
       ‒ O arguments can be unmarked or marked with the topical -na,
       ‒ certain types of O arguments in addressee function can be either unmarked or marked
        with the dative/locative -mo.",[295]
"The reported command in (6.14) illustrates a transitive clause; the A argument is covert:

       ‘“(You, two males) do not open this up!’ (he) said.’6.2.1.2 Differential S/A case markingThe form of pronouns for S, A, and O arguments is the same for all the persons. There is nomorphological distinction between marking of NPs in S function of intransitive clauses, in Afunction of transitive clauses, and in VCS function of verbless clauses. This is illustrated in(6.15-17) below. (6.15) is an example of an intransitive clause with the independent pronounkue ‘I’ functioning as S; in the transitive clause in (6.16) kue functions as A; in the verbless
191
      Such association applies equally to languages with accusative and with ergative marking of syntactic
relations. It is not treated as one of the criteria for S/A subjecthood in the language but merely as a confirmation
of one of a linguistic universal (Dixon, 2012).
                                                                                              276
clause in (6.17) as VCS. Note that A and S arguments, but not VS, are cross-referenced onthe verb.

Often in Murui the S/A arguments tend not to be stated when they are already retrievablefrom the context; they are always the cross-referencing on the verb. This is illustrated in(6.18):
(6.18) nia        bene             (kue) fɨebi-dɨ-kuePRED
          STILL   HERE.LOC:NSP     (1sg) stay-LK-1sg
          ‘I’ve stayed here until now.’
In Murui, marking of S/A argument is subject to differential S/A case marking where themarking of the S/A arguments depends on their pragmatics. In discourse, when the S/Aarguments are in focus, they are marked with the enclitic =dɨ. A set of contrastive examplesis presented in (6.19-20). Note that =dɨ never marks arguments in non-subject function (theseare marked with -na, see §6.2.1.3-4).","[300, 301]"

       ‘It was not Sandriela who came from Leticia. It was ELVER who came.’6.2.1.3 O core argumentsThe O argument in Murui is defined as the non-S/A core argument. Semantically, intransitive clauses, A arguments can potentially initiate or control the activity. As Dixon(2010b: 76) put it: “And if there is something which is saliently affected by the activity, theargument referring to this will be in the O function.” O arguments in Murui are recognizedbased on the following morphological and syntactic criteria:
1) The O argument is expressed only ‘outside’ the predicate (unlike the S/A arguments thatare cross-referenced on the predicate and oblique arguments), as in (6.38):

3) If O arguments have specific referents, they are case marked with the topical non-S/Asubject -na and cannot be marked with any other case markers. O arguments can also be leftunmarked (see §6.2.1.4 for factors conditioning the differential object marking). An exampleof a marked O argument is presented in (6.42) and a zero-marked O argument is in (6.43):

All types of nominal constituents can take the topical non-S/A subject marker -na (nouns,nominalizations, pronouns, and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers of all types). The sentence in
194
      The same form of the accusative case marker -na also occurs in Aguaruna (Jivaroan/Chicham) spoken in
Peru. In Aguaruna -na marks both O and E arguments, unlike in Murui (Overall, 2008: 215). In Hup (Makú)
spoken in the Vaupés it has the form -an (Epps, 2005). There is also a multifunctional -na marker in Tariana
which marks objects and recipients on pronouns (Aikhenvald, 2003).
                                                                                                283
(6.44) is an example of the specific anaphoric demonstrative nai- followed by the genericclassifier -e. Naie is marked with N.S/A.TOP -na and refers to hair-painting, something that thespeaker stopped doing a long time ago. Note that naie is marked regardless of the constituentorder, that is regardless of whether it is preposed or postposed to the verb (see also §6.3):

Examples (6.45-47) are nominalizations. In (6.45) jɨfanua ‘playing’ is in O function but it isunmarked (the referent is not specific). In (6.46-46) the nominalized manua ‘healing’ anduiya ‘taking’ are marked with -na. They are arguments of the perception verb uiño(te)‘know’. Note that arguments of perception verbs are frequently marked with -na in Murui.

In (6.48) the interrogative content word bue ‘what’ functions as an indefinite word‘something’. (6.48) is part of a prayer to the Father Creator to provide food for the people. Itis marked with -na because the speaker has something specific in mind, the food.

4) Murui has the default SXV and AOXV constituent orders where the S/A arguments are pre-posed to the clause-final predicate (see §6.3 for details). If the core arguments are unmarkedfor any of the core cases, the constituent order is the one that indicates the syntactic role ofthe participants. In the transitive clause, the placement of the O argument is restricted in thatthe O NP cannot precede the A argument but may follow the verb. When that is the case, it ismarked with the topical non-S/A subject marker. In (6.49) the O NP follows the verb and,therefore, takes -na.

In (6.50) akie rafue precedes the verb and remains unmarked. In this situation the speakerwanted to tell a story but he was uncertain which one he would tell it.

6.2.1.4 Other functions of -naThe topical non-S/A subject marker -na marks core O NPs (that are not in the addressee/recipient function, see §6.2.1.6). An NP can take no more than a single case marker at a time(but see the ablative marking in §6.2.2.2). The pattering of topical non-S/A subject casemarking conforms to certain grammatical and semantic restrictions conditioned by thesemantic and pragmatic status of the nominal (see the following section §6.2.1.5). The
                                                                                               285
marker -na is a phonologically and morphologically bound form. It is also a multifunctionalmarker which can mark other non-subject arguments that are frequently topical (and,therefore, it is called the ‘topical non-S/A subject marker’). These are:
1) Time words are frequently marked with -na (see also §3.2.2), such as naɨo-na ‘night (cf.naɨo ‘night)’, as in (6.51). Other nouns that are obligatorily marked with -na include, e.g.mona ‘day’.
(6.51) ua      jari-re-na            casi        naɨo-na        mei kaɨ
       really quick-ATT-N.S/A.TOP almost.Sp night-N.S/A.TOP so      1pl
       zai-ta-d-ePRED
       step-CAUS-LK-3
       ‘It was very quick, they almost stepped on us at night.’
2) Adverbs can take the marker -na, as in aiyuena ‘a lot’, ebena ‘brusque’, atona ‘straight’(see also §3.2.1). This is illustrated with marena ‘well’ in (6.52):
(6.52) kue=mei mare-na                      komui-dɨ-kuePRED
       1sg=so      good.ATT-N.S/A.TOP       grow-LK-1sg
       ‘I grew up well.’
3) The morpheme -na is one of the forms of the event nominalizer, as in (6.53) (see also§3.1.4):
(6.53) ee~e-na (cry~RED-E.NMLZ) ‘crying (and crying)’
       jaai-ñe-na (go-NEG-E.NMLZ) ‘not going’
       jea -re-na (dirty-ATT-E.NMLZ) ‘being dirty’
4) It is the source for ablative -mona on nouns (see §6.2.2.2), e.g. Colombia-mona ‘fromColombia’; on adverbial demonstratives the form of the ablative marking is -na (see §3.3.3),e.g. bene-na (HERE.LOC:NSP-ABL) ‘from here’.
5) the topical non-S/A subject marker can be used as a topical clause linker. For instance,constructions with the sequential dependent marker -no can be followed by the topical non-
                                                                                                              286
S/A subject -na. In (6.54), the sequential clause guajanona ‘after toasting’ and ɨmuiyanona‘after mixing with salts’ marked with N.S/A.TOP -na are highly topical and therefore aremarked with -na (Wojtylak, forthcoming-a).
(6.54) ie=mei      gua-ja-no-na                     ɨmui-ya-no-na
       CONN=so pound-E.NMLZ-SEQ-N.S/A.TOP add.salt-E.NMLZ-SEQ-N.S/A.TOP
       komeA jai         du-t-ePRED
       person already chew.coca-LK-3
       ‘And so, after pounding, after adding salts, one (person) already chews it (the coca).’
6) The topical non-S/A subject marker functions as a topical marker of clauses withpurposive meaning, as in (6.55) below. Murui purposive clauses are in fact future eventnominalizations that occur in the O function usually followed with -na. This is illustrated in(6.55).
(6.55) afai=dɨne                jaaitɨ-kuePRED servesaO [kue jiro-ye-na]
       upstream=AT.LOC:NSP go.FUT.LK-1sg beer.Sp 1sg drink-FUT.E.NMLZ-N.S/A.TOP
       ‘I will go upstream to drink beer (lit. my future drinking beer).’
The nominalizer -ye can be the sole marker of purposive construction as well (see §12.3.1).","[306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311]"
"       Verbless possessive constructions involve the R (and, often, the D) followed by theconnective ie that refers to the R anaphorically. Examples (5.3-4) are illustrative of this. (5.3)is verbless possessive construction with the R and D elements expressed in the clause. (5.4) is
                                                                                                 237
a verbless possessive construction with the omitted D. Verbless possessive constructions,such as (5.3), are frequently used as answers to the question bu-e bai-e? (Q1-CLF:G that.FSH-CLF:G) ‘what is this? (lit. what - that)’ while constructions such as in (5.4) are used as repliesto buu ie bai-e? (Q1 CONN that.FSH-CLF:G) ‘whose is this (lit. who his/hers - that)?’ (see§5.1.3.3).
(5.3) [moo ie]R        jafai-kɨD
      father CONN spirit-CLF:INHER
      ‘father’s spirit (belonging to the father)’
(5.4) mooR [jafai-kɨ                 ie]R
      father spirit-CLF:INHER CONN
      ‘father’s spirit’s (belonging to the spirit of the father)’
Additionally, Murui has a construction which involves a morphological process of affixationwhere the genitive -ɨe is applied to pronouns. Such form function as arguments of verblessclauses; they can also head an intransitive predicate. The marking of the genitive isconditioned by the Nominal Hierarchy, where the 1st and 2nd person pronouns (singular, dual,and plural) in R function are marked with -ɨe, as in (5.5). 3rd person pronouns referring to theR are marked with the connective ie, as in (5.6). The genitive marker is discussed in §5.1.1.2.
(5.5) [bi-e            jo-fo]VCS   kue-ɨeVCC
      this.CTS-CLF:G house-CLF:CAV 1sg-GEN

      ‘that (close to you) hospital is his’
Murui lacks a verb ‘have’. Stating relationship of possession in the language is achievedthrough predicative possessive constructions that involve markers on nouns and expressattribution or its lack (see §5.1.3.1), and the intransitive verb i(te) ‘exist’ where the R ismarked with the locative case (see §5.1.3.2). Another way to express possessive meaning isthrough a verbless clause marked with the connective ie, as illustrated in (5.6) above (see§5.1.3.3 for details).
                                                                                             238
        Although the vast majority of Murui nouns are optionally possessed, there are somewhich cannot be conceptualized as ‘ownable’. These are, among others, certain naturalphenomena. While some nouns (e.g. names of insects), tend not to occur in possessiveconstructions, others (such as kinship terms) are frequently possessed. A few nouns havedifferent readings when they occur in possessive constructions. The ‘possessibility’ of Muruinouns is the topic of §5.1.4.","[261, 262, 263]"
"      Similarly to classifiers, repeaters can also be used anaphorically. This is illustrated in(4.113), which refers to a conversation with the topic of audio recorders. An elder wanted tosee all the audio recorders:

4.6      Summary
Murui has a large multiple classifiers system, similarly to other neighboring languagesspoken in the vicinity of the Vaupés linguistic area. 169 The classifiers are suffixes that can bedefined as sets of morphemes used in various morphosyntactic contexts: on adjectives,number words, pronouns, demonstratives, and interrogative content words, quantifiers, aswell as on nouns (free and bound) and verbs. In terms of their morphological structure, Muruiclassifiers can be mono and disyllabic. In many cases, the meanings of disyllabic classifiersare not compositional. While semantics of monosyllabic forms appear to be more ‘general’ innature, meanings of the disyllabic forms are more specific. According to their function,semantics and the morphosyntactic contexts that they occur in, classifiers can be divided intothe following types: physical property classifiers (denoting, among others, shape, size,interioricity, consistency, and function), animate classifiers (distinguishing natural gender),abstract classifiers (designating abstract concepts), the neutral classifier -ra, and repeaters(these are nouns with with non-human referents). The assignment of classifiers is generallybased on the meaning of a noun referent and their properties. Three major functions of Muruiclassifiers are: derivation of nominal stems, formation of ‘headless’ nominal modifiers, andfunctioning as nominalizers in relative constructions. The important discourse function ofMurui classifiers is reference-tracking.","[258, 259]"
"        Grammatical relations are expressed through differential case marking where themarking of core arguments is related to topicality, definiteness, and affectedness. Underspecial pragmatic conditions, topical S/A subject, topical non-S/A subject, and O(recipient/addressee) arguments can be either unmarked or marked with case. Differentialmarking of the O NP arguments is illustrated by (1.8-9). Grammatical relations and casemarking in Murui are the topics of Chapter 6.

Murui has a rich system of verbal morphology, that is mostly aspectual; there is only one(future) tense marker. Example (1.10) shows numerous verbal categories expressed on theverb joko(de) ‘wash’. They include aspectual, directional, modal, and evidential marking.
(1.10) joko-ri-zai-aka-ñe-itɨ-kue=dɨ
       wash-DUR-ANDTV-DES-NEG-FUT.LK-1sg=CERT
       ‘I WILL not want to go washing.’
Murui has one evidential, the reported =ta. Witotoan languages differ with respect toexpression of evidential meanings, but they do appear to share at least one evidentiality value– the reported evidential. In that respect, the Witotoan languages are similar to otherlanguages spoken in the Caquetá-Putumayo region, such as Boran (Wojtylak, forthcoming-c).",[32]

      Semi-closed classes are not included in Table 3.4 (§3.4) as they are morphologically varied. Adverbs,
members of the semi-closed word class mostly are of adjectival origin, and function as modifiers of a verb.

4 Noun structure and classifiers4.1      Noun structure
The Murui noun phrase (NP) can be defined as a grammatical constituent that functions as anargument of a predicate. Murui noun phrases can also head intransitive predicates. The headof a simple NP can be a single noun, which can be modified by other nouns, adjectives,quantifiers, pronouns, demonstratives, interrogatives, and number words. The head of an NPfollows the modifier, as illustrated in (4.1-2). Adjectives always follow the head noun, asillustrated in (4.6) and (4.11) further in this section.

More complex NPs and NP heads include so-called ‘HEADLESS’ NOMINAL MODIFIERS, whichare formed from other word classes by means of classifiers (suffixes); noun head is not stated.","[202, 203, 204]"

6.2.1.6 Marking of O NP, with dative/locativeThe O NP argument that refers to the addressee/ recipient 200 can be marked with thedative/locative -mo or be left unmarked. 201 In (6.88) the argument of the second clause is theO NP kue (1sg) ‘I’ is marked with the topical non-S/A subject -na; the O NP oo (2sg) ‘you’ ismarked with the dative/locative -mo. Note that oo cannot be marked with-na.

Marking of the addressee depends on the nature of the O and it correlates with the NominalHierarchy, as well as the contrastive focus. Unmarked addressees can only be personalpronouns, proper nouns (personal names and kinship terms); nouns with other types of200
      ‘O NP addressee/ recipient’ can also be referred to as ‘indirect object’.
201
      Locative marker is one of the sources of differential object marking in Murui. This is similar to the
differential object marker -nuku in Tariana, an Arawak language spoken to the north (cf. Baniwa (Arawak)
-naku ‘on’) (Aikhenvald, 2003). Cross-linguistically, there is a tendency for DOM to have their origin in
locative markers.
                                                                                              296
referents are always marked with -mo. The meaning of marked arguments with thedative/locative is ‘focused O addressee/recipient’. The marking on the O NP:Addressee istypically used in imperative clauses where clause marked with -mo has an abrupt, brusquereading of ‘give ME (it)’, as in (6.89). Unmarked O NP:Addressee do not have such readings,as in (6.90).

6.2.1.7 ‘Oblique’ as core argumentSome verbs obligatorily take the locative marker. For instance, a type of a predicativeconstruction employs the intransitive verb i(te) ‘exist’ where the possessor (R) is marked withthe locative case; cf. ‘locational schema’ in Heine (1997). An example is given in (6.98) (seealso §5.1.3.2 on the use of i(te) in expressing possession).

Marking of some O NP arguments can also be related to argument structure, marking -na isnot possible. Verbs of seeing have different argument structure than verbs of looking: verbsof seeing are marked with -na (cf. (6.81) above), and verbs of looking with the locative-mo, as in (6.99).

The standard marker baaɨ-fe-mo (THERE-CLF:SIDE-LOC) ‘on the over there side (i.e. ahead of)’in comparative constructions obligatorily takes the locative marker (see §9.2).

6.2.1.8 Double case markingAll types of Murui verbs can be subject to derivations which increase valency and participatein causative derivation. Murui has a morphological mechanism, which allows for thecausative -ta to be applied twice yielding a causative of a causative ‒ the double causativethat forms the contiguous -ta-ta string of suffixes (see §8.2.2). (6.100-101) show thederivation mechanism of a ‘simple’ causative.

A constituent of a negated clause may bear additional stress. Additionally, the topical S/Aand non-S/A subject markers are present on a constituent that is in constrative focus. Toexpress meanings such as ‘it wasn’t the man we met, it was the spirit’ speakers say ‘we didn’tmeet THE MAN; we met THE SPIRIT’, as in (10.4) below (cf. jɨko=dɨ (dog=S/A.TOP) ‘dog’in example (6.10) in §6.2.1.1):

In Murui, questions differ from declarative and imperative clauses in both their intonation aswell as structure (see §11.2). The structure of some type of questions is unusual in thatpredicate markers can be omitted for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural. Negative questionswith omitted predicate markers have different readings than their positive counterparts (see§10.2.2). Murui has a single negative imperative (prohibitive) form, the standard negativemarker -ñe followed by the marker -no (see §10.2.3). Many of grammatical categoriesavailable in positive clauses are available in the negative as well but there is some minordegree of paradigmatic asymmetry between positive and negative imperatives. For instance,the grammatical category of rapid action (used for immediate imperative meanings) cannot beexpressed in negative imperative. The language has two ‘privative’ markers -nino on nouns,and -nino and -ñeno on verbs and adjectives (on verbs, -ñeno has prohibitive meanings, see§10.2.3).","[456, 457]"
"‘Headless’ nominal modifiers are formed with various members of open, semi-closed, andclosed word classes by means of classifiers. They can take further number and case marking(see §3.1.1). An illustrative example of a nominal with an adjectival root, followed by ananimate classifier and a case marker is given in (4.5) (see also §9.1 on NPs with adjectivalroots).
(4.5)      mare-ñaiñua-naNP:O                uiño-t-o?PRED

           ‘Do you know (those) beautiful (females)?’
Within an NP that contains a modifier followed by a noun, modifiers usually do not agreewith the head noun (but see also (5.105) in §5.2.2); modifying elements are always markedwith the generic classifier -e, regardless of the number or animacy of the noun, as illustratedwith the demonstrative bai- ‘that’ in (4.6) below:
140
      There are a number of dependencies between noun classes, number, and classifier types in their co-
occurrence (see §4.2.2.3 and §5.2).
                                                                                             181

Agreement is indicative of the distinction between an NP and a clause. In Murui classifiers(as well as classifier-repeaters) occur obligatorily as agreement markers in equative clauses(with the verbless copula subject VCS and the verbless copula complement VCC). This isillustrated in (4.7), which is a juxtaposition of two nominal forms in the VCS and VCCfunction, being therefore a full sentence.

Within an NP, adpositions are always postposed to the head noun (see also §3.3.6). This isillustrated in (4.8-9), with the locational dɨne ‘at’ and the comitative dɨga ‘with’:

4.2.2.7 Repeaters and specific classifiersThe distinction between classifiers and repeaters can sometimes be difficult to make as theyoccur in the same morphosyntactic loci. Moreover, Murui does not have a specificmechanism of marking agreement which would require repeaters to occur on modifyingelements, the usual role repeaters have in other neighboring languages (Aikhenvald, 2000:222). Nevertheless, there are a number of distinct properties of such bound forms thatdifferentiate them from ‘prototypical’ classifiers. Although both repeaters and classifiers havesimilar morphosyntactic environments, they are used under different conditions. Classifiersare used for nouns that fall into particular semantic categories which is grammaticallyestablished to be a classifier; repeaters are used as a residue class for nouns whose referentscannot be classified in terms of a ‘dedicated’ semantic category, such as the Spanish conceptof the ‘week’ (Zubin & Shimojo, 1993).","[244, 245]"

      This is also the case for the 2nd feminine dual pronoun that, in rapid speech, is pronounced as kañaɨ. The final
element -ɨ might be an older way of speaking. For instance, while in Murui the 1st person masculine dual is
koko; in Mɨnɨka it has the form kokoɨ.
                                                                                              157
C. Unlike 1st and 2nd person pronouns, the 3rd person dual forms -aɨmaiaɨ (masculine) and -aɨñuaɨ (feminine), are complex forms that include the plural -aɨ and the animate masculineclassifier -ma (masculine). As shown above for dual pronouns, the masculine gender isfunctionally unmarked in Murui. This is similar for the 3rd person marker -makɨ that containsthe animate masculine classifier -ma and the classifier -kɨ which has various meanings in thelanguage. One of them is to refer to an object that consists of many smaller inherent parts. Anexample can be rua-kɨ (sing.E.NMLZ-CLF:CLUSTER) for ‘ensemble, repertoire of songs’, orono-kɨ (hand-CLF:CLUSTER) for ‘hand (consisting of a set of fingers)’. In such fashion, onecould interpret -makɨ as a group, set of people (-ma and -kɨ).","[181, 182]"
"There is a certain flexibility in the constituent patterns where the oblique argument mayoccasionally precede the S/A argument (XSV and XAOV), or occur following the verb (SVXand AOVX). This suggests that X arguments have a certain degree of mobility within aclause. Occasionally, the O argument can occur in the clause-final position, i.e. AVO. Eventhough it is not common, the O argument can precede the A argument in transitive clauses(OAV). In such instances, the accusative marking on O NP is often retained, regardless of thereferent’s discourse status. There is also a prosodic emphasis (pitch) on the A argument(which might explain why in those cases the nominative marking is not necessarily retained).",[339]

3.3.6   AdpositionsMurui has a small class of adpositions (postpositions). They cannot be modified. We candistinguish the following types of postpositions:
A. POSTPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE FORMATIVE dɨ- ‒ there are the postpositions free formsdɨga ‘with, together with’ (cf. nɨga ‘how much’ in §3.3.4, and naga ‘each, every’ in §3.3.1)and dɨne (cf. the unproductive suffix with locative semantics -ne in §3.3.3), which often occuras enclitics. An example of post-head dɨne was given in (3.91), and (3.96). Dɨne can alsooccur as a free form meaning ‘there’; it functions similarly to lexical adverbialdemonstratives (§3.3.3). As such, it can be followed by case markers, as in (3.124):
(3.124) dɨne-naABL         bi-ye-zaPRED              kakarei!PRED
        AT.LOC:NSP-ABL     come-FUT.E.NMLZ-EMPH hear.TH
        ‘(They) have to come back from there, do you hear (me)?!’
The postposition dɨga ‘with, together with’ was shown in (3.52) and (3.115). In emphaticconstructions, it can occur as a pre-head position as a modifier to a noun meaning ‘many’, as(3.125), which is a casual exchange between two elders during a gathering in a maloca:
(3.125) A: [nɨ-ga      ra-nɨaɨ]NP:S i-t-e!PRED
           Q2-QUANT thing-COLL exist-LK-3
           ‘There are so many things (lit. how many things there are!)’ (exclamation)
         L: [dɨga     raa]NP:S (i-t-e!)PRED erua?
             MANY     thing    exist-LK-3 see.really
             ‘(There are) so many things! Right…?’ (exclamation)
                                                                                               175
B. UNDERIVED POSTPOSITIONS ‒ such as jɨaɨ ‘too (another)’, daa ‘the same’, izoi ‘like,similar’, meino ‘later’, and mei ‘so, later’, as in (3.126-127).
(3.126) [kue jɨaɨ!]
        1sg too
        ‘Me too!’
(3.127) oo [kue izoi]
        2sg 1sg       similar
        ‘You are like me.’
Murui has a special emphatic adposition, the locative koni (or oni), which can occur invarious positions in the clause, as in (3.128) as a clitic; and as a free form in (3.129), and thereciprocal bound marker koni- (cf. §3.3.2) in (3.130).

           RECIP-CLF:DR.M-LOC arrive-LK-3
           ‘One time the armadillo and the chucha met (each other).’
D. DERIVED ADPOSITIONS ‒ can be combined with case markers =dɨ, -na, -ri, -do, and thesimilative -ze, such as jira(dɨ), jira(ri) ‘because’, muidona ‘for reason’ (see example T2.14 inthe Appendix), fakai(na) and fakai(ze) ‘at time/moment that’ (see example T3.29),emodo(mo) ‘over, above, on top of’, ekɨ(na) ‘at the side’, ruika(na) ‘(at the other) side(commonly, of the river)’, and mamedo ‘in the name of’. The Murui postpositions are basedon nouns. An example of the postposition muido ‘for reason’ is given in (3.131) (cf. withmuidona in example (6.56) in §6.2.1.4).
                                                                                                                    176

3.3.7       InterjectionsMurui has a number of conventionalized emotional exclamations. The most frequent ones arejɨɨ 138 ‘yes, no’, jmm ‘hm’, and aa ‘ah’. They are used to express understanding or recognition,and are frequent in all types of genres in Murui (see §13.3). Another type of interjection is oothat is used to respond to someone’s call. The sound ↓ɨh, used to express a sign of agreementand backchanneling, is used primarily by older speakers of Murui. Another conventionalizedinterjection in the language is aɨ ‘oh!’ that is used to express various types of surprise ordisbelief (it has no special phonological characteristics). The interjection oo is used to answercalls, and the interjection ñee functions commonly as a filler that gives the speaker time whilethey get their thoughts together (see §13.4). There are also interjections that are characteristicto Murui songs, such as jii, juu, and jaa (§13.3.3). See also §13.4 on the attention getting baa.","[199, 200, 201]"

6.1       Grammatical relations ‒ general characteristics
Grammatical relations in Murui involve NP participants ‒ core and non-core (oblique)arguments of verbs, marked by a case system. The internal structure of a typical clause inMurui involves a predicate and a number of arguments, these are S, A, and O. Syntacticarguments S and A are marked in a similar fashion; O is marked differently. A mention oftwo arguments simultaneously in normal discourse is rare. 187 Both core and obliquearguments are often elided in normal speech, if they can be understood due to commonknowledge or previous discourse. Factors that govern the omission of arguments are drivenby the discourse. Murui, similarly to other neighboring languages spoken in the area, hasdifferential case marking. Marking of core arguments S/A and O is related to topicality andfocality as well as specificity of referents.",[294]

A1. NOUN-LIKE UNDERIVED ADJECTIVES THAT CAN OCCUR AS FREE FORMS ‒ this classincludes:
DIMENSION:               aiyo ‘big’
AGE:                     komo ‘new’
These adjectives take the generic classifier -e when they be used as ‘headless’ nominalmodifiers, as in aiyue ‘big (unspecified object)’ and komue ‘new (unspecified object)’. 253253
      In some dialects of Murui (e.g. as spoken by the Monanizaɨ clan), komue is pronounced as komoɨe.
                                                                                                402
Within an NP, they are always pre-posed to noun and are unmarked for case. The head nountakes case markers, as illustrated in (9.1).
(9.1) [bi-e          ɨɨi-ñɨaɨ]A [komue          jo-fo-na]O      [jɨaɨ-e

      summer-CLF:SEASON-LOC make-FUT.LK-3
      ‘These man will finish the new house next summer.’
The adjectives aiyo ‘big’ and komo ‘new’ can also form ‘headless’ nominal modifiers whenthey are followed directly by classifiers, such as komo-ko (new-CLF:COVER) ‘new (house)’and aiyo-neko (big-CLF.REP:MALOCA) ‘big (maloca)’. As such they can further function asheads of intransitive predicates. This is illustrated in (9.2) where the adjective aiyo ‘big’followed by the generic classifier -e takes the predicate marking.
(9.2) [[komue jaai-ra]             Walter      ie]S    aiyue-d-ePRED
      new.CLF:G go-CLF:NEUT Walter             CONN    big.CLF:G-LK-3
      ‘Walter’s new ladder is big.’
Without any further derivation, they can be used as modifiers to verbs, e.g. komo rii-d-e(recently arrive-LK-3) ‘(he) came recently’, eo aiyo i-t-e (very a.lot exist-LK-3) ‘there is a lot(of it)’ (see also §3.2.1).","[426, 427]"

      That is, unless they appear in the form of verbal classifiers, which, synchronically, appear to be unproductive
in Murui. Traditional Murui seems to have had verbal classifiers that ‘refer’ to S and O arguments (never to A),
as in tɨe-na-d-e (cut-CLF:TREE-LK-3) ‘cut down (trees)’ (Wojtylak, 2017b). Note that such ‘verbal classifiers’ are
nowadays rare in Murui. In older texts (Petersen de Piñeros, 1994b; Preuss, 1921, 1923) verbal classifiers were a
productive process deriving verbal stems (Petersen de Piñeros, p.c.).
                                                                                                               271
This is illustrated in (6.4-5). The difference between these two examples is related to howtopical the referent is in the context. In (6.4) nokae ‘canoe’ is unmarked implying that thecanoe is not topical and has a ‘generic’ referent. In (6.5) ‘canoe’ is specific (a speaker has aspecific referent in mind) and is therefore marked with topical non-S/A subject marker -na. 189The marking of the core cases (S/A and O) is discussed in §6.2.
(6.4)      nokaeO fɨno-dɨ-o?PRED
           canoe    make-LK-2sg
           ‘Did you make a canoe?’ (enquiring if you made a canoe)
(6.5)      nokae-naO         fɨno-dɨ-o?PRED
           canoe-N.S/A.TOP make-LK-2sg
           ‘Did you make the canoe?’ (implying that you know how to make canoes)
In addition to the typical SV/AOV constituent order (see §6.3), the overt core-case marking isone of the main grammatical mechanism to distinguish core arguments within a clause (seealso Chapter 8 on valency-changing mechanisms). When no overt morphological marking ofgrammatical relations is present, in order to avoid any potential misunderstanding, the orderof the NPs helps to determine syntactic functions of core arguments. It is thus apparent thatthere are two mechanisms for distinguishing syntactic functions of the core arguments inMurui: the morphological mechanism (i.e. overt case marking on S/A and O arguments) andthe syntactic mechanism (i.e. constituent order).","[295, 296]"

6.2.2.1 LocativeMurui locative case marker functions as an oblique argument marking location of an object inspace, as in (6.104) and (6.105), or a direction, as in (6.106-108). 203

Omission of the locative case marking in such constructions is very rare. A few expressionsdo not always seem to require the locative marking. This only happens when a constituent hasan inherently locational meaning, is related to a commonly done activity and its meaning isunderstood from the context. Such expressions relate to common activities, such as ‘coming’,
203
      See also §6.2.1.7 for the locative functioning as a core argument.
                                                                                               301
‘doing’, and ‘going’, as illustrated in (6.109-111) below. An NP will almost always occurwith the locative -mo, rather than be unmarked (compare (6.109-6.111) with (4.33) in§4.2.2.2). The cases where the locative is omitted are exceptional, however.

In the following example (6.112), the repeated locational NP does not have the locationalcase marking. The sentence was uttered by a Murui speaker who lived long time in LaChorrera with the Minɨka. In Mɨnɨka jofo means ‘inside’ while in Murui, it is foo. 204 Foo,being an adverb of place, does not take the locative marking. Although it is unclear if theomission of the locative marker is for this reason, the speaker meant either ‘home’ or ‘insideof the village’.

Murui has also distinct, frequently occurring, direction markers that are suffixed to verbalpredicates – the ventive that encodes movements where the orientation of the motion is awayfrom the reference point, and the andative that indicates movements away from the referencepoint (see §7.2 on spatial setting). There is a symmetrical alignment between the direction204
      Cf. with the classifier -fo for ‘cavity’ (see §4.2.2.1).
                                                                                               302
markers and arguments with the locative and the ablative case (if present). The same goes forthe andative with the locative, as in (6.113), and the ventive with the ablative case, as in(6.114):

        El.Encanto-ABL chew.coca.VENTV-LK-1sg
        ‘I came from El Encanto to chew coca.’
Elsewhere in the grammar, Murui locative case extends to cover the domain of time on verbalpredicates where it occurs as a clause linker marking temporal relations (see §12.3.1). Itindicates that an action happened simultaneously while another action was taking place. Thisis illustrated in (6.115):
(6.115) gaɨri-dɨ-kaɨ-mo       jɨaɨ-kɨnoS         rii-yaPRED
        gather-LK-1pl-TEMP    other-CLF:NEWS arrive-E.NMLZ
        ‘While we were gathered (at night in a communal house), another message came.’
The locative -mo is also used in lexicalized expressions used for counting in Murui (see§3.2.3). In comparative constructions, various forms of the STANDARD MARKER ofcomparison take obligatorily the locative case marker as well (see Wojtylak (forthcoming-b)and §9.2 on comparative constructions), as in kue baaɨ-fe-mo (1sg THERE-CLF:SIDE-LOC)meaning ‘than me’ but best translated as ‘me on the over there side, ahead of me’.","[325, 326, 327]"
"        Rather, the native word mano-ri-ra-ko (heal-DUR-CLF:NEUT-CLF:COVER) ‘healing house’        is used instead. 159
159
      The word manorirako is referred back to with the classifier -ko, as in bi-ko (this-CLF:COVER) ‘this house,
hospital etc.’.
                                                                                            219
    b) a form of repeater is the same as that of the classifier. This is the case for -ro    (CLF:STRING) and -ro as a possible source of a repeater of rero ‘watch’ (phonologically    adapted from the Spanish word reloj). In such cases, disyllabic forms are preferred. In    case of rero, it is da-rero (one-CLF.REP:WATCH.Sp) ‘one (watch)’.
    c) under specific circumstances forms of certain repeaters are ambiguous. This is the    case for instance for the repeater -dora from Spanish which can refer to either    komputadora ‘computer’ or grabadora ‘recorder’. To disambiguate, in a situation where    both objects are present, a full noun is used instead.","[243, 244]"
"They can head intransitive clauses (‘verb-like adjectives’), as in ebi-re-d-e (nice-ATT-LK-3)‘(it’s) nice’, and be used as ‘headless’ nominal modifiers (‘noun-like adjectives’), as in ebi-fue (nice-CLF:STORY) ‘a nice story’ (see §3.1.3 for details). The semantic difference betweenan adjective used as a head of an intransitive predicate or as a ‘headless’ nominal modifierrelates to temporality (‘temporal’ vs. ‘timeless’; examples (3.15-16) in §3.1.3 are a case inpoint). Out of the two construction types, the former can be negated; the latter can be negatedonly when used as heads of intransitive predicates. Murui adjectives have a number offeatures on their own, such as the obligatory co-occurrence with the attributive markers (see252
      Core sematic types typologically associated with both large and small adjective classes include dimension,
value, color, and age. Other core semantic types, such as physical property, human propensity, speed, difficulty,
and time are cross-linguistically associated with medium-sized and large adjective classes (Dixon, 1982).

§9.1.2 on criteria for distinguishing adjectives from verbs and nouns). Both verb-like andnoun-like adjectives can occur as a Parameter of comparison in comparative constructions(see §9.2). Murui underived and derived adjectives ‒ unlike nouns and verbs ‒ can haveadverbial functions and occur as modifiers to verbs, e.g. ebi-re ro-t-e (nice-ATT sing-LK-3)‘(she) sings nicely’.","[425, 426]"

Occasionally, when a noun with an animate referent is marked for number, but its plurality indiscourse is not important, the number agreement on the ‘headless’ nominal modifiers can beomitted, as illustrated in (5.109). This is similar to nouns with inanimate referents. Theiragreement is usually optional, as in (5.110).

6 Grammatical relationsThis chapter deals with grammatical relations and case marking in Murui. Generalcharacteristics of grammatical relationships are discussed in §6.1. The following section dealswith semantics, marking, and functions of core arguments (discussed in §6.2.1) and obliquearguments (§6.2.2). Order of arguments is discussed in §6.3. This is followed by a summaryin section §6.4.","[292, 293, 294]"
"        Murui possessive construction involves the Possessor (R) which can be a noun, a fullNP, or an independent pronoun, and the Possessed (D) which is frequently a noun, andalways functions as a head. Murui possessive constructions show no marking on either the Ror the D; the R and the D are simply juxtaposed within the NP with the Possessor-Possessedconstituent order, as in (1.7):
(1.7) [LusioR yoe-faiD]NP
      Lucio     metal-CLF:SHORT.THICKER
      ‘Lucio’s machete’
Marking of the genitive -ɨe is conditioned by the Nominal Hierarchy where -ɨe occurs with 1stand 2nd personal pronouns, e.g. kue-ɨe (1sg-GEN) ‘mine’, and the connective ie which occurs
                                                                                              7
with 3rd person Lusio ie (Lucio CONN) ‘Lucio’s’. Murui lacks both a verb meaning ‘have’ aswell as the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession. The expression ofpossession and number are discussed in Chapter 5.","[31, 32]"
            Each NP takes a single case marker at a time. This is the case for any kind of casemarker (core or non-core). Murui case markers are always suffixed to the final element (thehead) of an NP (see §3.1 on the noun structure and §4.1 on the structure of Murui NP).,[297]
"
    3.2.1    Adverbs    Murui adverbs constitute a semi-closed word class. They are modifiers to verbs and    predicates (never used as predicate heads); the majority cannot take case marking (but some    can be marked for the topical non-S/A marker -na). The majority of Murui adverbs are of    adjectival origin (where deadjectival forms function like adverbs; these constitute an open    word-class); other types form closed word classes. Another distinguishing property of    adverbs is that they answer the question nɨeze? ‘how’, rather than bue? ‘what’ or nɨe?    ‘which’ (see §3.3.4). Murui distinguishes between adverbs of manner and place. The    properties of the Murui adverbs are summarized below:

A. ADVERBS OF MANNER – on morphological grounds, adverbs of manner can be divided intoa number of classes:
A1. OPEN CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN MARKED WITH -re – most ofthese manner adverbs are of adjectival origin (and as such can be used as heads of intransitivepredicates). They belong to an open class and cannot take case marking. This is illustrated in(3.32), where the adjective jea- ‘dirty’, followed by the positive attributive -re, modifiers theverb eruaɨ(de) ‘look’:
(3.32) bi-kos                   jea-re       eruaɨ-d-ePRED
       this.CTS-CLF.REP:DOG dirty-ATT        look-LK-3
       ‘This (dog) looks dirty.’
A2. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN (OPEN WORD CLASS) MARKEDWITH -re – a small group of adjectives, which have the positive attributive -re as a part of theroot (rather than a separate suffix, see §3.1.3), obligatorily take the topical non-S/A marker-na in adverbial position. This is illustrated in (3.33), with the adjective mare ‘good’modifying a verb.
(3.33) [kue jɨko]S mare-na                   joruaɨ-d-ePRED
       1sg dog     good.ATT-N.S/A.TOP        seem-LK-3
       ‘My dog seems well (lit. good).’
A3. CLOSED CLASS OF MANNER ADVERBS OF ADJECTIVAL ORIGIN (CLOSED WORD CLASS),UNMARKED – there is a small group of adjectival roots which can function as adverbs andquantifiers (see §3.1.3). These are komo ‘new (recent)’ and aiyo ‘big (a lot)’. Similarly toother adjectives, they take classifiers to form ‘headless’ nominal modifiers, e.g. aiyo-ko (big-CLF.REP:DOG) ‘big (dog)’. Underived, they function as adverbs and quantifiers. This is
                                                                                                140
illustared in (3.34-35) (see also §3.3.1 on the quantifier aiyo ‘a lot’). They can be furthermodifier with the intensifier eo ‘very’.
(3.34) eo aiyo i-t-ePRED
       very a.lot exist-LK-3
       ‘There is a lot (of it!)’
(3.35) komo       rii-d-ePRED
       recently arrive-LK-3
       ‘(He) has just arrived.’
Interestingly, when they take the generic classifier -e obligatorily followed by the topicalnon-S/A subject marker -na, they can also occur in the adverbial position, as in (3.36).","[163, 164, 165]"
"Main differences between classifiers and repeaters are outlined in Table 4.7. Given theirfunctional and formal properties of repeaters, Murui repeaters slowly appropriate propertiesof classifiers as a noun categorization mechanism in the language.

In some cases there are subtle distinction between classifiers and repeaters. This is due to thefact that in some cases repeaters appear to be the origin of classifiers. For instance, theclassifier -vui (CLF:CYCLE) ‘time cycle of usually a month, also covers season’ seems to haveoriginated in fɨvui ‘moon’ (which subsequently extended its meaning to ‘season’).","[245, 246]"
"            Murui adjectives can either function as heads of intransitive predicates (they are neverused in transitive clauses; these are so-called ‘verb-like adjectives’), as illustrated in (3.15), oras ‘headless’ nominal modifiers that are used as arguments in verbless clauses (these are‘noun-like adjectives’), as in (3.16) below. The head is the adjectival root jea- ‘dirty’ in bothexamples. The semantic difference between (3.15) and (3.16) relates to temporality. In (3.15)the attribution is ‘temporal’; the place is dirty because someone did not clean it in the rightway. In (3.16) it is ‘timeless’; the fruit is by nature dirty and cannot revert to becoming‘clean’. 107 In both cases (3.15) and (3.16), the ‘headless’ nominal modifiers naino ‘that(place)’ and jeakɨ ‘dirty (fruit)’ are referential, and are understood from the immediatecontext.

The suffix -ze is productive with nouns, and it has the equative-like meanings that refer tosize (see §9.2.6). Nominal modifiers with -ze have similative-like meanings, as in nɨ-e-ze (Q2-CLF:G-SIMIL) ‘how?’ in (3.41) and bi-e-ze (this.CTS-CLF:G-SIMIL) ‘like this’ in (3.42). Such

used on various types of arguments (§6.2.1).

6.2       Arguments and case: semantics, marking, and function
In Murui, core and oblique arguments can either be stated or, if they are directly inferablefrom the discourse context, omitted. There are five major clause structure types that can bedistinguished in the language (see §12.1):
189
      Similarly to other neighboring languages spoken in the vicinity of the Vaupés linguistic area (Aikhenvald,
2006; Birchall, 2014; Bruil, 2016; Epps, 2006, 2009b; Stenzel, 2008; Zúñiga, 2007).
                                                                                                            272
        ‒    intransitive clauses ‒ with intransitive subject (S) as core argument,
        ‒    extended intransitive clauses ‒ with intransitive subject (S) and the obligatorily
             oblique (E) as core arguments unmarked, or marked with the locative case,
        ‒    transitive clauses ‒ with transitive subject (A) and transitive object (O) as core
             arguments,
        ‒    extended transitive ‒ with the with transitive subject (A), and two objects (O
             and E) as core arguments,
        ‒    verbless clauses ‒ with verbless copula subject (VCS) and (VCC) verbless copula
             complement as arguments.","[296, 297]"
"The overt marking of the core cases is conditioned by both discourse and alignment ofconstituent order in the clause. Murui non-core arguments are optional and can be included ineither clause type. These oblique arguments are: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-causal, and privative. Marking of the non-core cases is usually mandatory (see §6.2.2.1 on theomission of the locative).",[297]
"The referents of (3.4), as well as (3.5), are understood from the context. The ‘headlessly’ usednominal nai-gɨ (ANA.SP-CLF:OVAL.BIGGER) ‘that (egg)’ in (3.5) is further marked with case,the topical non-S/A subject marker -na.

Murui classifiers have a variety of functions in the language; they frequently occur on verbsas various types of nominalizers (see §3.1.4). This is illustrated in (3.6).
(3.6) [jiibi-eO   du-tɨ-mɨe-na]O                     uiño-t-ePRED

In (3.6), the verbal root du ‘chew coca’ is nominalized by means of the animate masculineclassifier -mɨe, and is further case-marked with the topical non-S/A subject marker -na.","[145, 146]"
"Time words also contain forms that occur with the positive attributive -re, as in ɨkare‘tomorrow’, nare ‘yesterday’, aare ‘long (time)’. A few can take the topical non-S/A subject-na, such as naɨo ‘night’ and naɨona ‘at night’. 115 In (3.45) naɨo is topical and receives the -na marking.

       soon night-N.S/A.TOP tell-FUT.E.NMLZ
       ‘It will (have to) be told soon, tonight!’

      These are: dayu ‘for a short while (between 5-30 minutes)’ > dayujiza ‘for a very short while (only a few
minutes)’, aiyɨ ‘in a short moment’ > aiyɨjiza ‘right now’, naiyɨ ‘later’ > naiyɨjiza ‘much later’, ɨko ‘in the
future’ > ɨkojiza ‘one day in the future’. See T1.55 in the Appendix.
114
      Jaie (glossed as PAST) is a variant of jae ‘(in the) past’, see e.g. T1.12, T1.15, and T3.26 in the Appendix.
115
      It is interesting to notice that na- occurs with time words in Murui, such as naɨo ‘night’ > naɨo-na ‘at night’.
The suffix -na on time words in Murui is homophonous with topical non-S/A subject marker -na. This is similar
in Tucano, a language spoken by the Murui neighbors to the north. In the Tucanoan languages the form -re is
used as a suffix marking O, oblique arguments, locative as well as ‘temporal nominals’ (Stenzel, 2004: 229-
230). This is similar to the form =nuku in Tariana (Arawak), a language which has been in contact with Tucano
(Aikhenvald, 2003).
                                                                                                                145
The suffix -kaño forms the words ‘once’ (dakaño, cf. da- ‘one’) and ‘twice’ (menakaño, cf.mena ‘two’) from number words. 116 Nominal modifiers can take classifiers and havetemporal meanings, such as bi-rui (this.CTS-CLF:DAY) ‘today’, jɨaɨ-mona (other-CLF:SEASON)‘next year’ (see §4.2). Unlike other time words, nouns referring to time take nominalmorphology, as in bi-rui-aɨ (this.CTS-CLF:DAY-PL) ‘nowadays (lit. these days)’. A number ofsuch nouns are lexicalized expressions that obligatorily occur with the locative case marking-mo, such as jitɨ-ra-mo (dark-CLF:NEUT-LOC) ‘at dusk’.

"       The influence of Spanish on Murui morphology is less apparent than that on the onphonology, or the lexical ‘inventory’ of the language. Nevertheless, one can say that thespeech of young speakers is in a stage of change. An example of this is the negation of thepositive attributive marker -re which in the speech of innovative Murui speakers can benegated with the standard negative -ñe; in the speech of the elders such negation isungrammatical (see §5.1.3.1). Another example is the use of the differential object marker -na, which in the speech of young people is somewhat more ‘loosely’ used (see §6.2). The useof Murui ‘dedicated’ comparative constructions (§9.2) is yet another example. Monoclausalcomparative constructions types (that are somewhat similar to those in Spanish) are usedmore frequently by younger speakers; older speakers tend to use biclausal constructions. Thespeech of young speakers is full of Spanish discourse markers and linkers such as pero(Spanish for ‘but’) and y (Spanish for ‘and’). The speech of Mesia Magallanes Ordoñez (Text5 in the Appendix) is a case in point.

13.5.2 Loanwords and calques from SpanishSpanish loanwords in Murui are numerous; the aversion to ‘language mixing’ reported forVaupés (see Aikhenvald 2002, Epps 2006, and others) is absent among the People of theCentre cultural area. 321 Loanwords are typically adopted phonologically in the speech ofMurui elders, as in epejo for Spanish espejo ‘mirror’, but not in the speech of youngerspeakers (see §2.6). An example of application of native morphology is given in (13.64),where the Spanish tieda ‘store’ (phonologically adopted) is followed by the native pluralform -ɨaɨ. 322(13.64) tieda-ɨaɨ
        store.Sp-PL
        ‘stores’
In general, Murui speakers are fully aware which words are ‘truly’ Murui, and which not. Afew words from Spanish appear to have been nativized (and, therefore, are not considered tobe Spanish loans), such as pe(te) ‘kick’ (possibly from Spanish patear ‘kick’). The mostfrequent Spanish loanwords in Murui are illustrated in Table 13.1. 323 Note that borrowednouns can easily take some nominal morphology (such as number marking, as in (13.64)above). Borrowed verbs typically occur with the nominalizers, that can be followed bysequential marker, as the nominalizer maneja-ja (operate-E.NMLZ) ‘operating’ in example(13.73) in §13.5.3.","[571, 572]"
"While in positive declarative sentences non-subject arguments are optionally marked withtopical non-S/A subject -na (see §6.2.1), in their negative counterparts -na is almostfrequently present, as in (10.17-18) below.

Identity in Murui is expressed by means of an intransitive predicate when S arguments arepronominal subjects (see Table 7.1 in §7.1). In such cases nouns function as heads ofintransitive clauses, as in (10.19). Intransitive predicates can be negated with the standardnegative -ñe. (10.20) illustrates a negated predicate with the nominal head yofueraɨño‘(female) teacher’.

For 3rd person singular, dual, and plural, identity is typically expressed by juxtaposition oftwo NP’s, as in (10.21) (see also §12.1.1 on verbless clauses). As Murui verbless clauses

cannot express verbal categories (such as tense or aspect) or negation, the only way toexpress them is by means of negated intransitive predicates with nominal heads. Compare the‘positive’ verbless clauses with the negated ones in (10.22-23):

Verbal roots that are marked with the negative attributive -ni have the meaning of‘not having ability (to perform an action)’.
