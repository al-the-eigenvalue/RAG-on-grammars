                                TOPICALIZATION                     OF     THE           ERGATIVEl.   For         special       emphasis           an     ergative               may          be     brought           to    the     begin-
ning of the sentence:  this is called topicalization.    Topical-
ized ergatives must be expressed by pronouns,   never by nouns.
Topical ergatives  are either independent pronouns,   demonstrative
pronouns,           interrogative                 pronouns,               or        relative              pronouns.               The
basic       sentence           pattern           for     an     independent                        pronoun       topical            erga-
tive       is:

Notice that    (b)              and  (c) are progressive simplificiations   of    (a).
The  (a) variant                of this sentence represents  an older form of the
language;   it is               also considered more formal and elegant.      The
Simplifications                 are newer forms and are considered   informal    and
casual.","[83, 84]"

general.   In the following                   sections        there are different sets of
numbers which must be used                    to count        specific kinds of things:
living beings,    human beings,  long things,   canoes  (vehicles  in
general),  humans    aboard or in vehicles,   volume measurements,
linear       measurements.            Anything        other       than    these    specific      classes
of   objects      is   counted        using    the     numbers       in    this    section.

same stems as the general numbers,   but with a -gn or -xn suffix
(related to           the     word    for      tree:      gan).        This     suffix       is    always       un-

The first set, with the stressed   suffix -on   (related to an'on:
hand or arm)  is used by most speakers of Tsimshian to count
both linear and volume units of measure.     Some,  however, use it
to count only volume units and use the second set for linear
                                            40
units.    The    second   set   has   a   stressed      suffix     -gaay     (related    to
the    word for arm,   chest, wing).             When    used    as   a   noun,   the   first
set     (-on) refers to the specific             number    of    fathoms.

clitics because   they sometimes            are prefixed directly to the
word and at other times act as              separate word prepositions.   Pro-
clitics      express     locative,     aspectual,     modal,        case      relational,         and
lexical      meanings.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]"

designator,  transitive verb,   ergative noun phrase,  absolutive
noun phrase  (TEMP VB,, ERG ABS),  or  (b) temporal designator,   in-
transitive         verb,       absOlutive            noun         phrase       (TEMP    VB.     ABS).       Tsim-
shian is very unlike English in that Tsimshian does not have
subjects and objects.  The subjects of intransitive   sentences
and the direct objects of transitive  sentences are in Tsimshian
considered         to    be    the     same     kind         of    noun    phrase,           i.e.,   they    are
considered  to have the same grammatical   function;   they are both
called absolutives.    Subjects of transitive   sentences   in Tsim-
shian are called ergatives.     Subjects of intransitive    sentences
are not considered  to be like subjects of transitive      sentences,
as is the case in English.

2.     The       -a/null            enclitic        connective               attaches    to    the    verb     when     it
is     followed              immediately            by     the        absolutive.        The    same        enclitic
attaches               to    an     ergative        when       it      is    followed    by    an    absolutive.

If     the absolutive   is a proper                              noun,  then the enclitic connective
is     -as/-s  (intransitive verb)                               or -at/-t   (transitive verb).

precedes  an ergative.  At the same time a -t enclitic  attaches                                                             to
the temporal designation.

the        -t    form        of     the    connective:                -dit     (before   an    ergative)        or    -at/-t

semantic relationship between                                     the transitive                    verb and the abso-

absolutive            could be, then the absolutive                                       can        be    incorporated                  into

word order.   A -da enclitic attaches  to the absolutive.    The
connective between the transitive verb and the ergative    is -a/
null and there is no -t enclitic on the temporal designation.

                                          POSSESSIVES1. Possession  is shown by placing the possessor noun after the
noun that is owned.    The two nouns   (or noun phrases)  are connect-
ed by the -a/null enclitic    if the possessor  is a common noun and
by the -as/-s enclitic    if the owner is a proper noun.     Unless it
is   something    that       is    considered        to   be    a    part    of   the    owner,        the
possessed noun has a na- prefix.     This prefix comes before the
plural prefix.   Some kinship terms do not have the na- prefix
when they are possessed.    This fact implies   that some kinsmen are
considered,      in   some        way,   part   of    one      another.

attaching to the words they possess.     The na- prefix is used with
pronominals  in the same manner as with genitive nouns.    The
possessive pronominals   are:

                            GRAMMATICAL            SUFFIXES1. There are ten suffixes which,     when attached to words,     change
their grammatical    relationships  (actor,   recipient of action,
etc.)  and sometimes   their grammatical    function  (noun, verb,
etc.).","[43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]"

determined by the scale on page 64 the ergative  enclitic  -da
may become -a, and the -t enclitic on the TEMP may be omitted.
     a)     Yagwat       t'uusda          'yuuta      hana'k.
                   The    man     is   pushing         the      woman.
     b)     Nah    t'uusa        'yuuta        hana'k.

                                               67When proper nouns occur in such                       sentences,          they    take   the   -s
enclitic rather than the -t.
       f)   Yagwat    t'uusdit           Dzonit     Meli.
                  John    is     pushing      Mary.
       g)   Nah   t'uusas        Dzons     Meli.
                  John    pushed     Mary.
In general    in the more marked temporal designations   the ergative
takes on all the morpho-syntactic     characteristics  of the abso-
lutive.    This is true for both nouns and pronominals.","[82, 83]"

                         THE    NOUN     PHRASE        -    NUMERALS1. A numeral precedes the noun it numbers.            It takes an -a or
null enclitic connective:      -a if it ends in a stop,         affricate or
fricative   and null if it ends in a vowel or sonorant.             Numerals
for humans,    long objects,   canoes,    humans aboard a conveyance,
and unit measures    can stand alone as nouns.          General numerals
are used for houses,     dreams,   masks,    flowers,   ghosts,   spheres,
abstract     things,    and    anything        else        not     specifically           designated
by the other classes.       Animal numerals    are used garments,   skins,
anything   flat, e.g., mats,      also for bak'wis   (Bigfoot), hawhaw
 (a supernatural   animal),    and naxnox  (supernatural beings).     The
numerals   for canoes are used for any vehicle.   k'ttl walp                                              one house

1. Definite  articles  and demonstratives occur after the nouns
they determine.    The noun takes an -a or null enclitic   suffix
when it is followed by such a determiner.     Determiners do not
occur in the same noun phrase with numerals.     The determiners
are:
   gwa'a               here, close        to    the        speaker
   gwasga              over there

They take an -m enclitic   suffix and must agree in number with
the noun they modify.    A noun phrase may have both a numeral and
an adjective.   NumeralScome before adjectives.     A noun phrase
may have both an adjective and a determiner.     A noun phrase may
have more than one adjective.

Notes:   1)   When an x comes     before   a              vowel  or         Mm, it   becomes      g.
         2)   When the   enclitic    suffix               -m comes          after    an Mm,
              it becomes   -n.","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73]"

"8.    Vowels      may   be
                   short or long.       The long vowel     is indicated by
a    double       (aa, ee,
                 letter      ii, OOo, uu).      The long vowel     is pro-
nounced  in one of three ways:      (1)   sustained,   i.e.,  with   an even
pitch,  (2) with a falling pitch and offglide to the vowel             sound
in the English word    ""what,""   (3) with a glottal       interruption or
constriction.

The underlining of the back a (a)  and the acute accent over the
falling vowels  (Aa) are optional orthographic   conventions  and
are often omitted by proficient users of Tsimshian.      Some prefer
to write the falling vowels as ah, eh,   ih, oh, uh.","[19, 20]"

               THE   FORMATION      OF    THE    PLURAL   -   SUPPLETIVES1. In a number of verbs and adjectives   the plural agreement   form
ismorphologically  unrelated to the singular  form, i.e.,  they
are not related by any transparent morphological mechanism.      In
such words the number of the absolutive has evidently become a
part of the semantic  characterization of the verbs and adjec-
tives     themselves.   singular                      plural

                               DERIVATIONAL     REDUPLICATION1. Reduplication   is also used to form new words,     i.e.,   it is a
derivational mechanism.      Unlike the plural reduplication      (an
inflexional mechanism)    the reduplicated derivations     often copy
the vowel as well as one or more consonants of the model sylla-
ble.   Reduplicated derivations     function to express repeated
activity or state of being      (iterative), intensification,    natural
species,       body     parts,     and   perhaps        even    a     ""derivational        plural.""","[37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]"

COVER:         The Raven drawing was inspired by the crest used for the
               Conference on Northwest Coast Studies held in May,    1976,
               at Simon Fraser University    and co-sponsored by The
               National Museum of Man.    The crest was taken from a
               tombstone     honouring           Peter     Hill   of      Masset,     B.C.   and   was
               featured     in    the     film    ""Those     Born      at    Masset"".

                                                  PREFACE     The purpose of this reference grammar is to provide biling-
ual teachers,  teacher's  aides and other interested persons with
a nontechnical  introduction to the Coast Tsimshian  language.
This grammar is designed to be used in conjunction with A Prac-
tteal     Dtettonary          of    the   Coast       Tsimshtan   Language,   compiled     and
edited by John Dunn,      published by the National Museum of Man,
Ottawa,    Ontario.   It is also designed for persons who speak and
write English and who understand the basic grammatical        structure
of English.      It is not intended as a set of lesson plans.     How-
ever,   the teacher of Tsimshian might use it as a guide for devel-
oping instructional materials.        The grammar should also prove
useful to advanced students       of Tsimshian.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"

"3. The stop consonants  are b, d, g, k, p, and t.   There are two
kinds of gee and kay:  ordinary and backed.   Backed gee and kay,
pronounced by pulling the back of the tongue back against the
uvula,   are  indicated   by underlining    (g,   k).                                       There   are two            se-
ries   of voiceless   stops:  plain  (k, k,    p,   t)                                     and  checked  or
glottalized   (k', 'k, k',   'k, p', 'p, t',    't).  In some checked
stops the glottalic    closure coincides with the consonant clo-
sure and the vocal cords are released      after the consonant    is
released.   This type of glottalization      is indicated by an apos-
trophe        after        the    consonant         letter        (k',     k',         p',      t').     In     some
checked  stops the glottalic closure occurs before the consonant
Closure.   This latter type of glottalization  is indicated by an
apostrophe before the consonant   letter ('k, 'k, 'p,  't).

as the ess in sip or as the esh in ship.        The barred-ell   is
produced much like an ess,      except that the tip of the tongue
touches   the alveopalatal   ridge behind the upper incisors    and the
air flow is around one or both sides of the tongue.         Barred-ell
is a lateral   like ell and a fricative     like ess.   The ach   (x) is
a uvular fricative.     During its production    the back of the
tongue  is pulled back close to the uvula.

         The    Reference        Grammar     for     the    Coast         Tstmshian     Language       is
a non-technical   introduction to the phonology,      morphology,   and
syntax of Coast Tsimshian as it is currently spoken in Metlakatla,
Alaska,  Port Simpson,   Kitkatla, Hartley Bay,    and Prince Rupert,
British Columbia.     The grammar contains  an explanation of the
practical orthography currently    in use.    It also contains    sect-
ions dealing with pronunciation and sound changes,         word forma-
tion  (morphology),   and syntax.  At the end of the grammar there
are summaries   showing the basic  sentence   types and their gram-
matical relationships.","[4, 5]"
