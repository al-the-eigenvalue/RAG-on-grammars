2.1.11 Phonological patterns of reduplication
       Reduplication is pervasive in the Chumash languages. In Barbareho
there are lexicalized and productive forms of reduplication. Details are given
in Wash 1995. Lexicalized reduplication occurs in seven different patterns:e CVC
(77)    kopkop                      ‘toad!

         There are five types of productive reduplication. In each type, the
reduplicant is a bimoraic syllable prefixed to the base. The types differ in the
segmental form of the reduplicant and/or the base. Reduplicated nouns
typically show emphatic glottalization in the base.e Type I: regular productive reduplication(98)    hik           ‘to do'                             hik.hik

2.2     Morphology
        Barbareho Chumash is an agglutinative language. It is also a head-
marking language: grammatical relations are marked on the verb and there
is no case marking on nouns. Grammatical relations show a nominative-
accusative pattern. There are no canonical adpositions or adjectives. There is
significant prefixing on both verbs and nouns. Suffixation does occur, but not
to the same extent. The basic morphological structure of the verb and noun
is covered in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 respectively.","[60, 61, 62, 63]"
"7. It is easy to confuse the subordinative prefix ~al- with the stativizing
prefix 2al-, especially in cases where floating glottalization occurs.
Historically the two morphemes are probably connected. In most of the cases
in Beeler and Whistler 1980 where the underlying form is given as -al-, I
would analyze it as 2al~. A full treatment of these two morphemes is beyond
the scope of this study. However, since -al- often occurs in pragmatically                                      113
marked constructions, I certainly agree with their analysis that -al- '...can
perhaps better be seen as marking a weak focussing of the verbal force,
paralleling the function of some clefts in English' (1980:92, note 3).","[135, 136]"
"Pronominal subject marking
        Different patterns emerged in the marking of pronominal subjects in
the adverbial clauses. In almost all cases where subject marking was affected,
it was affected in the postposed clauses. However, the loss of pronominal
subject marking in the postposed clauses happened for different reasons.
        In all purposive clauses coded by the Gukanu 'so that, in order to'
clause type, the loss or retention of the subject pronoun was motivated by the
semantics of agency and control. When the main clause subject had full
control over the event or situation depicted in the adverbial clause, subject
marking in the adverbial clause was suppressed. On the other hand, when the
main clause subject did not have control over the event or situation depicted                                               348
in the adverbial clause, or, when it was rather the adverbial clause subject that
had full control, then subject marking in the purpose clause was retained.
Purpose clauses could have the subject pronoun suppressed or retained
regardless   of whether
       Alase af   urha  the purpose clause subject was a semantic patient. The
critical difference was the degree of control on the part of the main clause
subject. These generalizations turned out to be true whether the purpose
clause and its main clause had same subjects or different subjects, though
same-subject Gukanu clauses were rare. The semantics of control also seemed
to be the motivating factor behind the loss of the subject pronoun in the one
mehu   ‘because, since, from; in order to'     clause type token that coded a
purpose relation. Interestingly, however, there was rarely a loss of pronominal
subject marking in Gu ‘so that, in order to' adverbial clauses, 100% of which
are purposive and postposed. There were clear instances in which the main
clause subject was an agent that had full control of the event depicted in the
adverbial clause, but even so, the presence or absence       of control was not
something that was coded in the morphosyntax of this adverbial clause type.
With rare exception, Gu    'so that, in order to' clauses were found to have
subject marking whether they were same-subject or different-subject clauses.
In all but one of the few, exceptional cases, the lack of subject marking
involved the third person singular prefix s-. The lack of that subject prefix
was argued to be related to articulatory difficulties having to do with the close
proximity of sibilants.
      In other adverbial clause types, namely the 2akimpi        'during, while;
when! simultaneous temporal clauses, the kKayké 'because'        reason clauses,
and the kaheé 'like, as if' manner clauses, the loss of the subject pronoun
happened mainly in same-subject adverbial clauses. Such loss seems to be
motivated by the fact that postposed, same-subject adverbial clauses have a
tighter semantic bond with their main clauses than do preposed adverbial
clauses or postposed adverbial clauses with a different subject. In Barbareho
Chumash, however, such loss in subject marking applies only to third person
subjects (singular, plural, or indefinite). It never applies to adverbial clause
subjects in first or second person.
        In only several cases was the adverbial clause nominalized. In such
cases, the third person subject pronoun was not retained. This was true
whether the nominalized clause was a same-subject or different-subject
adverbial clause. Such is the expected pattern of nominalized clauses
generally, as we saw in chapter 2.
        In several of the adverbial clause types we saw examples of
discontinuous clauses, in which there is intervening material between the                                       349
adverbial conjunction and the rest of its clause. This intervening material may
consist of an adverbial clause from a different clause type, or it may consist
of a left-dislocated noun. Subject marking is affected in these discontinuous
clauses,

especially clear with the Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clauses in chapter 12.
The discontinuous Gukanu clauses retained subject marking but the regular
(non-disrupted) Gukanu clause counterparts did not retain subject marking.
           Finally, sometimes in the Kayké                      'because'         and kaheé               'like, as if!
clause types, subject marking was lost in different-subject clauses. In most cases
where this pattern occurred the adverbial clause predicate had the stative
prefix 2al-. This prefix never co-occurs with the third person pronoun s-,
but it can and does occur with first and second person pronouns. This co-
occurrence restriction on the third person pronoun s- and the stative prefix
2?al- remains an unexplained phenomenon in Chumashan linguistics. As
pointed out in chapter 2, it is also not always clear why a given predicate
would take the stative prefix instead of the third person pronoun on one
occasion, and then (on another occasion) take the third person pronoun
instead of the stative prefix. Transitivity of the predicate is not in all cases a
factor, since the stative prefix 2al- can and does appear in finite verbs with
transitivizing morphology, such as applicative suffixes. Further research into
the area of third person reference in Barbareno Chumash discourse should
shed light on the patterns of subject marking we have seen in the adverbial
clause constructions.","[370, 371, 372]"

epenthetic /?/ begins the word if it is otherwise vowel initial. The imperative
form of kutiy takes a slightly different form when its meaning includes a
third singular object. In such cases it ends with /l/ instead of /y/.       kutiyit                   ""look at me!*

"Their main function is that of qualifying the meaning of the main clause
proposition. These two factors alone, i.e. i) that the adverbial clause does not
have a global role in structuring the discourse and ii) that the adverbial clause
serves mainly in the localized role of qualifying the meaning of the main
clause, are often enough motivation for the adverbial clause to assume a
postposed position. In this sense, the postposed position is the default position
for adverbial clauses. (Since topics and themes come first rather than last, in
the order of topic-comment and theme-rheme, the adverbial clause that is not
serving in a topic-like or theme-like capacity, ie. as a point of orientation,
would most likely be postposed.) There are, however, other factors that
increase the probability of an adverbial clause appearing postposed instead of
preposed: i) referent tracking; ii) an embedded main clause; iii) a main clause
that already has preposed material, such as a topicalized NP or a preposed
adverbial clause; iv) the adverbial clause has the additional function of an
afterthought or reminder; v) the adverbial clause is part of a routinized
construction in which the adverbial clause is always in final position; and
finally, specific to temporal clauses, vi) the adverbial clause codes a terminal
temporal boundary.
         For some of these factors, to understand why they increase the
likelihood that an adverbial clause will be postposed it is helpful to look to the
theory of information flow (Chafe 1976, 1987, 1992, 1994), the principle of
least effort (Zipf 1935) and iconic motivation in language (Haiman 1983), all
of which are interrelated. Considering first the factor of referent tracking, we
saw that an adverbial clause tends to be final if it is tracking a referent that
was introduced (or re-introduced) into the discourse context as a full NP in
the associated main clause. The full NP has New information status in the
main clause, as it is being activated or re-activated in the listener’s
consciousness. In the postposed adverbial clause, the NP acquires Given
status, as it is then already activated in the listener’s consciousness, and the
referent is indexed as a pronominal affix instead of as a full NP. A reversal of
the clausal order would in many cases lead to ambiguity in meaning, as it
would not in all cases be clear who or what was being referred to, by the
pronominal affix, if the adverbial clause were preposed.
        Other factors underscore the importance of conceptual relevance and
(hence) iconic motivation in the ordering of clauses. A clause is more likely                                              553
to be contiguous to the clause whose meaning it qualifies or completes. Thus
in all cases where the main clause was embedded, the adverbial clause was
never preposed. If the main clause in question was a complement clause, the
adverbial ciause did not come between it and its matrix verb. If the main
clause in question was a relative clause, the adverbial clause did not come
between it and its head NP in the matrix clause. In the former case, it would
be infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the matrix verb
and complement clause, because the complement clause completes the
meaning imparted by the matrix verb, while the adverbial clause adds further
information about the complement clause. In the latter case, it would be
infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the head NP and
relative clause, because the relative clause provides information that is directly
relevant to the head NP, while the adverbial clause provides information that
is directly relevant to the relative clause. The clausal orders are iconically
motivated in that the clauses most conceptually relevant to each other are
always positioned next to each other. Such iconically motivated clausal orders
should require the least cognitive effort in processing information about the
events and states named by the clauses in question.
        Iconic motivation also has a crucial role in the factor specific to
temporal clauses: in the corpus, temporal clauses that code terminal
boundaries tend to be postposed rather than preposed. The motivation is
iconic in that terminal-boundary temporal clauses code events that happen last
in a given series of events. Hence, the clauses that code them tend to be last
in a given series of clauses. The only exceptions are those that also perform
as pivotal points of orientation, making reference to a prior event and also
providing a context in which a succeeding event occurs. In such cases there is
a competing motivation: terminal events are last in a given series of events
and hence should be coded by final clauses, but pivotal points of orientation
need to be coded first in a given a series of clauses, because they provide
crucial, contextualizing information for the following event(s) or situation(s).
In such cases, the latter motivation takes precedence. So the terminal-
boundary temporal clause, which would otherwise be postposed, has to be
preposed in those cases.
        Adverbial clauses also tend to be final when the associated main clause
already has preposed, associated material, such as a topicalized NP or another
adverbial clause. This preposed, associated material is already doing the task
of setting a scene or otherwise breaking the discourse into thematically-
coherent chunks. It is not necessary (or perhaps even possible) for the
adverbial clause in question to assume that role, so it assumes the postposed                                       354
position. Another possible reason that the adverbial clause is final, in such
cases, is that it might too much of a cognitive burden to have so much
pragmatically-marked material preposed to the main clause, especially in a
      initio! language Uke Darhasohn Chumas
       Finally, adverbial clauses that serve as reminders or afterthoughts are
always final. The order is again iconically motivated in that reminders and
afterthoughts are comments on events and situations that were mentioned in
the preceding context, and the clausal order reflects this by the fact that
reminders and afterthoughts are coded by final clauses.","[575, 576, 577]"

finds in the grammar of adverbial clauses in Barbareno Chumash, from a
functionally-oriented perspective of language. I used thirteen, structurally-
distinguishable adverbial clause types as a starting point. I gave a detailed
account of the kinds of semantic relations coded by these adverbial clause
types and the morphosyntactic patterns one finds associated with the semantic
relations within each clause type. I then compared the initial and final tokens
of these types with respect to similarities and differences in structure, extent
of scope, and punctuation/intonation boundaries. Finally, I focussed on the
similarities and differences in discourse functions between initial and final
clauses that code purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral
relations.
         It is interesting to consider the areas of adverbial clause grammar
where Barbareno Chumash differs from other languages, the areas of
adverbial clause grammar where it shows striking similarities with other
languages, and why it is that the differences and similarities appear where they
do. For example, Barbareno Chumash grammar codes the same kinds of
semantic relations one finds in other languages: temporal, conditional, neutral
(which many researchers treat as conditional), concessive, manner,
reason/causal, and purposive. Many languages code these semantic categories
in adverbial clauses, but the ways in which they code them can be quite
different. To illustrate this point, I will highlight some of the differences with
regard to temporal and conditional/neutral relations.
         English has the conjunctions before and after, which denote respectively
a precedence (posteriority) relation, where the main clause event precedes the
adverbial clause event, and a subsequence (anteriority) relation, where the
main clause event occurs subsequent to the adverbial clause event. Barbareno
Chumash does not have temporal conjunctions that mean 'before' or
 ‘after’, but instead uses the general, non-temporally specific conjunction
mali 'when' in both cases, in combination with other morphosyntax that
further specifies the temporal relation. Thus in terms of the variety of
temporal conjunctions that can be used to code precedence and subsequence
temporal relations, English is more explicit than Barbareno Chumash.","[578, 579, 580]"

as a result of the sorcerer’s magic. Since the main clause subject (the sorcerer)
controls what is happening to the adverbial clause subject (the people), there
should not be any subject pronoun indexed on the first verb mik 'to be
long'. The verb of course has the future tense prefix sa2-, but that is all that
it should have. Ideally, then, the first verb in line f. should have the form
*samék, not the form samék that was written instead. The aspirated [s]
means that there is a third person subject pronoun present, in this case a non-
referential or ""dummy"" third person with the meaning 'it'. Yet this pronoun
should not be there. The mystery is solved when one looks closely at
Harrington’s transcription of the word sPamdk in example (22) on the
following page. The aspiration mark looks like it was written in afterward.","[299, 300, 301]"
"1.6 Literature review
       Taken as a whole, the literature on adverbial clauses is immense. This
topic has been written about from vastly different perspectives not only within
linguistics, but within other fields of learning such as philosophy. As discussed
in section 1.8, my data on Barbareno adverbial clauses occur within narrative
discourse. Most of the vast literature on adverbial clauses, however, deals with
constructed data. I am particularly interested in studies that examine adverbial
clauses within a discourse context, such as monologic narrative or
conversation, because such studies focus on questions and issues that are most
relevant to a functionally-oriented perspective on language. The following are
some of the sources that inform my descriptions and analyses of adverbial
clauses in Barbarefo, though these of course are not the whole extent of my
references to the adverbial clause literature in the dissertation: Haiman 1978,
Chafe 1984, Thompson 1985, Thompson and Longacre 1985, Ford and
Thompson 1986, Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990, and Ford
1993,
        Some of the sources mentioned above give an overview of adverbial
clauses from a functional and cross-linguistic perspective. Givén (1990)
discusses adverbial clauses in his chapter on interclausal coherence. First he                                         6
gives a typology of adverbial clauses by semantic category, i.e. temporal,
conditional, cause and reason, concessive, substitutive, additive, and purposive.
Following that is a discussion about participial adverbial clauses, which are a
type of adverbial clause that does not have a specific semantic relation.
Finally, he discusses the functions that adverbial clauses are known to have in
the coherence and grounding of discourse, with a specific focus on the
differences between preposed and postposed adverbial clauses. Most if not all
of the examples in Givén 1990 are constructed sentences. Still, this source
provides a good starting point for ways in which to analyze adverbial clause
data.
       An extensive taxonomy of adverbial clauses from a cross-linguistic
perspective is given in Thompson and Longacre 1985. Adverbial clause
constructions are defined as 'a set of two-clause constructions in which one
clause can be said to modify the other in a way similar to the way in which an
adverb modifies a proposition' (p. 171). This article has two parts. Part I
discusses in detail the types of adverbial clauses found around the world.
These are labeled according to the kinds of semantic relationships that they
signal,   specifically:     time,   location,   manner,   purpose,    reason,
circumstantial/means,     simultaneous, conditional, concessive, substitutive,
additive, and absolutive. Thompson has since discarded the absolutive
category.’ With each semantic category of adverbial clause, Thompson and
Longacre describe and explain certain structural or morphosyntactic
regularities that one usually finds associated with them. Part I of the study also
highlights similarities between the types of adverbial clauses and other kinds
of syntactic structures, for example juxtaposed clauses, that can convey similar
meanings.      There is also some discussion of borrowed subordinators;
specifically, the factors that lead to one language borrowing an adverbial
clause conjunction from another language. Part II of the Thompson and
Longacre study examines adverbial clauses from a discourse perspective in
monologic texts. It focuses on the ways in which adverbial clauses are relevant
to the structure of paragraphs and of the discourse as a whole. The issues and
questions addressed in Thompson and Longacre 1985, regarding both specific
types of adverbial clauses as well as specific functions, are a useful heuristic
for anyone planning a case study on adverbial clauses.
         Chafe 1984 explores how intonation contours and punctuation units
reflect the extent to which an adverbial clause is bound to its main clause, in
English written and conversational discourse. If both an adverbial clause and
its main clause occur in the same intonation or punctuation unit, the adverbial
clause is said to be 'bound'. Otherwise, it is said to be 'free'. This study                                        7
 compares four types of adverbial clauses: preposed clauses that are free,
 preposed clauses that are bound; postposed clauses that are free, and
 postposed clauses that are bound. A major finding was that adverbial clauses
 that are bound are almost always postposed. Chafe explains this tendency
 through the theory of Information Flow. The intonation/punctuation unit is the
 domain of information flow, with information flowing from the old or familiar
 to the new or unfamiliar. When two clauses fall under a single contour, it is
 likely that only one of the clauses will convey new or unfamiliar information.
 Chafe found that the postposed adverbial clauses contained the new or
unfamiliar information. A second important finding is that free adverbial
 clauses are much more common than bound adverbial clauses. Free adverbial
clauses tend to occur initially, however, because they function as 'guideposts'
to information flow, 'signaling a path or orientation in terms of which the
following information is to be understood ' (p. 444). This, according to Chafe,
is probably the prototypical function of adverbial clauses. For the free
adverbial clauses that occur postposed, Chafe found other explanations. Some
were afterthoughts. Other free, postposed adverbial clauses functioned to
modify only the latter part of the preceding main clause, rather than modifying
the entire main clause. This suggests, according to Chafe, that '...the modified
portion of the main clause [is] not even clearly articulated in the speaker’s
mind until the main clause was completed' (p. 447). The findings in Chafe’s
study are incorporated into the issues and questions I address in parts three
and four of this dissertation.
         Ford 1993 is an entire monograph devoted to the discourse functions
of adverbial clauses in American English conversation, using the sociological
framework of conversation analysis. Focusing on prosody and interaction
within a conversational context, the author examines the distribution and
discourse functions of temporal, conditional, and causal (reason) adverbial
clauses. There are two main conclusions. The first is that preposed adverbial
clauses play a significant, global role in the structuring of a discourse. The
second is that postposed adverbial clauses have a local role of modifying the
proposition of the preceding main clause, without affecting the overall
organization of the discourse. These conclusions are echoed throughout all of
the literature on adverbial clauses reviewed here, including those studies using
monologic data. Ford’s other findings are that conditional clauses are most
often initial, while temporal and causal (reason) clauses are most often final.
The reasons for these distributions are discussed in terms of factors that are
specific to talk-in-interaction, e.g. the system of turn-taking, problems in
understanding and agreement between speaker and hearer, the need to soften                                       8
assertions, personal motivations, listener prompts, etc. None of these factors
are directly applicable to the data in my Barbareno corpus. However,
throughout the book Ford makes specific predictions or generalizations about
the functions of initial and final temporal, conditional, and causal clauses.
These predictions provide another perspective that has proven useful to my
analyses of the Barbareno data in parts three and four of the dissertation.
        Haiman 1978 is a crosslinguistic study of the connection between
conditional clauses and topics. The author finds that, very often among
unrelated languages, conditional clauses and topics resemble each other in
marking and in function. Haiman notes that this similarity is at first surprising,
since topics and conditional clauses are structures that one would not normally
think to be related. Haiman’s discussion follows the premise that similarity in
structure must reflect a similarity in meaning since '...grammars tend to miss
semantic generalizations, rather than to create spurious ones' (p. 565). He
compares traditional definitions of conditional clauses in the philosophical
literature with definitions of 'topic' found in linguistics literature, and finds
that the definitions are similar. Topics and conditional clauses are found to be
unchallengeable and thereby ‘constitute the framework which has been
selected for the following discourse’ (pp. 583,585). In other words, both are
pragmatically presupposed (Givén 1990:830). The main conclusions from this
study are that conditional clauses and topics belong to the same category, and
that conditional clauses are the topics, i.e. givens or presuppositions, of the
sentences in which they occur. As Givén (1990:846) notes, this comparison of
adverbial clauses and topics can only go so far. Prototypical nominal topics
tend to be highly recurrent and important, i.e. anaphoric and cataphoric,
whereas adverbial clauses are rarely recurrent. Still, Haiman’s observations are
relevant to Barbareho data in that many initial adverbial clauses precede the
topic marker 21. This is especially true of those adverbial clauses that express
a conditional relation. The foregoing is the extent of the insight that Haiman
1978 provides for the purposes of my study, however, since his data consist of
sentences constructed in isolation.
        Ford and Thompson 1986 is a study of the discourse function of
conditionals in both spoken and written texts. One of the central aims of that
study is to test Haiman’s (1978) proposal that conditionals have the same
function as topics. The authors found that there are several functions that
conditional clauses may have in discourse contexts. Most of these are
associated with conditionals that occur in initial position. Like topics, initial
conditionals serve as a framework of shared information for the following
discourse. First, initial conditionals may be used to repeat claims voiced earlier                                        9
in the discourse. A different, second function is that they may establish
contrasts with information given earlier in the discourse. Or, third, they can be
used to introduce particular cases exemplifying preceding generalizations.
Finally, initial conditionals may also function to offer other options or points
of view that are relevant to those of the preceding discourse. Final
conditionals, unlike initial conditionals, seem to be motivated by factors that
have little to do with the need for a shared frame of reference. For example,
the length of the conditional clause can affect whether it is initial or final;
lengthy ones tend to be final. If the conditional clause is embedded within
another clause then it tends to be postposed, and its scope is limited to the
embedded clause. Also, important or lengthy subjects in the consequent clause
tend to be initial rather than final, which means that the conditional clause has
to be final. Ford and Thompson also found that final conditionals tend to
follow main clauses that express an evaluation or question, though they cannot
explain why this should be so. Final conditional clauses do not play as
important a role in organizing the frame of a discourse as initial conditionals
do; they are not pivotal points in the development of a discourse. One notable
function of final conditionals, however, is that they often function to introduce
afterthoughts or serve as reminders. In conversational texts, conditionals are
used to make polite requests, or otherwise make a given point of view appear
less dogmatic or intrusive. The texts in my Barbareno database are not
conversational texts. Nonetheless, the Ford and Thompson study provides
many insights that have been incorporated into chapter 21 of this dissertation.
         Thompson 1985 is a seminal study of the discourse properties of
purpose clauses in written English texts. The author focuses on the different
discourse functions of initial and final purpose clauses. Her main findings are
that initial and final purpose clauses have radically different roles with respect
to the organization of the discourse, even though both types of clauses have
a similar structure:        '...the initial purpose clause functions to state a ""problem"" within
       the context of expectations raised by the preceding discourse, to which
       the following material (often many clauses) provides a solution, while
       the final purpose clause plays the much more local role of stating the
       purpose for which the action named in the immediately preceding
       clause is performed' (p. 55).","[28, 29, 30, 31, 32]"
"12.1.1.1 Same-subject clauses in which the subject pronoun is retained
        In both instances where the subject pronoun is retained in a same-
subject Gukanu clause, the main clause subject does not have control over
what it undergoes in the adverbial clause event. This is true even though the
main clause subject may instigate what eventually happens to itself in the
adverbial   clause. In both     cases, the adverbial clause event concerns what
happens to the main clause subject as a result of ingesting cathartic or
hallucinogenic substances. The main clause subject thus lacks control over
what happens to itself in the adverbial clause event. This is reflected in the
morphosyntax by the fact that the adverbial clause retains subject marking on
the verb. For example, in (5), the main clause and the Gukanu clause have
the same subject and are indexed with the first person plural pronoun k-iy-.

1.9.2 Semantic analysis of the adverbial clauses
        Part of the task of this dissertation was to determine the extent to
which the traditional semantic categories (temporal, conditional, concessive,
reason, purpose, and manner) are valid for adverbial clauses in Barbareho
Chumash. The following are strategies I used in determining which semantic
relation a given adverbial clause has. I did not assume that a given semantic
relation applies, across the board, to all of the tokens of a given adverbial
clause type. The semantic relation for a given adverbial clause was determined
on a case-by-case basis. In determining the meaning of a given adverbial
clause, I first looked at (1) the context in which the clause occurs and (2)
Harrington’s gloss or translation for that clause. These were important factors
for me in deciding how to interpret the meaning of an adverbial clause and
its surrounding context. I will now take each semantic relation in turn and
describe how these were dealt with in the dissertation.","[37, 38]"

involve a predicate that must have the stative prefix 2al-, such as predicate
nominals. As noted in chapter 2, the third person pronoun s- does not occur
in predicates that require the stative 2a1-. In two other cases, the adverbial
clause predicate is nominalized. As seen in chapter 2, nominalized clauses with
third person subjects do not have a subject pronoun, except if a particle or
some other morpheme comes between the article 1= and the verb of the
nominalized clause.
        Several illustrations of different-subject kayké clauses are given below.
In (15), the main clause has a first person plural subject that is coded with
k-iy- '1-PL-'; the kayké clause has a third person plural subject that is
coded with s-iy- '3-PL-'. In this excerpt, Yee mentions indoor tasks that
she and her family would do on rainy days, and explains why cleaning the
beans was one of those tasks.","[327, 328]"

main clause. It continues tracking the referent Lucrecia, first introduced in line
b. The temporal clause has to be postposed because, if it were preposed, the

Florentino, the topicalized NP in line a., instead of Lucrecia, the object NP in
line b. (It will be recalled that pronouns in Chumash languages do not
distinguish gender.) Thus if the order of the adverbial clause were changed,
the meaning would change to:

       <so that the ground would be smooth.>       Harrington and I differ on the translation of the Gukanu clause in line
d. The translation for oxmoloéin should be 'to be smooth'. (The verb that
means 'to smoothen; to make smooth’ is soxmoloGin (<su- causative +
oxmoloéin 'to be smooth')). In my analysis, the subject of the clause in d.
is the ground, not the people. Since the people contro] the texture of the
ground by sprinkling it with water, the adverbial subject pronoun (denoted by
aspirated [s}] in tSukanus""a?.. -) should be suppressed. Even if
Harrington’s translation were correct, one would still expect the adverbial
clause subject pronoun to be suppressed, because, again, it is the main clause
subject that has contro! over the situation in the adverbial clause: When one
looks at Harrington’s actual] handwriting for this token, the aspiration diacritic
looks like it may have been added in as an afterthought. A copy from the
microfilm is given below in (24). It shows how Harrington wrote line d. of
(23).                                                          ,(24) Harrington’s transcription of (23) line d. (59.0506)
        Two examples of what I would consider grammatical or licit aspiration
are seen in Harrington’s handwriting in (25) below. These are from different
texts. The first tSukanus“a?- sequence is from the Gukanu clause in
example (10) line b.; the second tSukanus""a2- sequence is. from the
éukanu clause in (11) line c. In both of these tokens, Harrington made ample
room for the aspiration between the segments s and a in the future tense
prefix sa2-. That is, the aspiration does not at all look as though Harrington
could have written it in as an afterthought. In both instances, in my analysis,
the aspiration should indeed be there just like it is in the attested forms.(25)

       In any case, the counter-examples shown earlier are rare. However, it
remains troubling to think that Harrington may have added diacritics and
other phonetic material into his transcription, material which may possibly not
reflect the sounds as Mary Yee uttered them. It is hoped that a future analysis
will reveal that Harrington’ s transcription of the counter-examples does indeed
make sense in some as yet unrecognized grammatical pattern. In the
meantime, it is difficult to know what should be concluded from such cases.","[303, 304, 305, 306]"
"16.1.4 Cohesiveness with the main clause
        As we saw in chapter 2, the manner verbs in two-verb predicates have
full subject marking and may take tense and aspectual affixes. In rare cases
they even have dependent NPs. In this sense they like clauses, but they are
generally much less clause-like than kaheé clauses. The manner verbs,
together with the second verb in the two-verb predicate, are tightly integrated
into a single clause. Manner relations coded by kaheé clauses, however,                                             331
always involve two clearly distinct clauses: the main clause and the kaheé
clause. Still, some kaheé clauses are more semantically and structurally
bonded with their main clauses than is the case for other kaheé clauses. The
former kind of kaheé clause has the dependent proclitic hi=, and its
corresponding main clause is very short. Only 2 of the 15 kaheé clause tokens
show a tight structural and semantic bonding with the main clause. These
tokens are illustrated in examples (11) and (12). The first token is an
elicitation in which Mary Yee describes the way in which an ocean wave
moves. Since it is a same-subject kaneé clause with a third singular subject,
there is no subject pronoun in the adverbial clause. The subject is, however,
coded with the third person pronoun s- in the main clause.","[353, 354]"

2.2.1.1   Person and number
         Pronominal affixes show a nominative-accusative pattern. As Ono
(1996) has argued, these affixes are truly referential pronouns. They should
not be thought of as agreement markers, which serve only to copy certain
features of independent NPs. An utterance can be complete with just the verb
and its affixes, because the pronominal affixes already indicate who or what
is being talked about.
         The prefixes index the subject of the verb, distinguishing three persons
(first, second, and third person) and four numbers (singular, dual, plural, and
indefinite or unspecified). Table 5 lists the subject pronominal prefixes.","[63, 64]"
"22.1.1.3 Linkage with highly stylized temporal clauses
        Earlier in this chapter we saw that back-reference in a temporal clause
can happen via repetition of a verb or other elements from the preceding
context. As has been noted for the Chibchan and Tucanoan languages of
South America (Thompson and Longacre 1985:227-228), the way in which
                                           474
back-references occur can become highly stylized in adverbial clauses. In these
languages, as in Barbareho Chumash, such formulaic adverbial clauses tend
to include two particular elements: i) a verb of highly generic meaning, e.g.
 ‘do',    'be',   or   ‘say’   and   ii) a demonstrative          clement.    In   Barbarehc
Chumash, the stylized temporal clause always has some inflected form of the
verb ne(s) 'do' along with the proximal deictic clitic he2=. In addition,
these temporal clauses always take the conjunction Gu ‘and; but' and the
adverbial conjunction na 'when'. In short, these stylized temporal clauses
have the following form, in Barbareho Chumash:         ¢u  =na   =he2?=[subject]-ne(s)-(optional                            suffixes)
         CONJ=when=PRX=[1/2/3]    -dowhich roughly translates as: 'and when {he/she/it/they} did so'.
        Formulaic temporal clauses have another interesting restriction in
Barbareho Chumash: they refer back to events that involve looking or
glancing at something that is unexpected, if not strange and unsettling. In fact,
Harrington usually translated the verb ne(s) in these stylized clauses as
 'look' instead of the actual meaning, 'do'.
        There are only 11 tokens of these formulaic temporal clauses in the
corpus, representing 8% of all initial temporal clauses. In every case, this kind
of temporal clause heralds the arrival of a climactic event in the development
of the story line. Ford (1993:147) points out that this is one of the functions
of initial temporal clauses.
         Several examples with this type of temporal clause are presented
below. In the first three of these examples, the temporal clause is immediately
preceded by a clause that has a verb whose meaning involves looking,
glancing, seeing, etc. In (13), a clause with the verb walaqimen                   'to turn the
head and look; to glance over one’s shoulder ' (line b.) immediately precedes
the formualic temporal clause 'and when he did so' (line c.). The temporal
clause refers back to the event in which the sorcerer turns his head to look at
the window, and at the same time it highlights the climactic scene in which the
sorcerer sees something so frightening that it eventually leads to his death.","[496, 497]"

         Initial and final conditional clauses in Barbareho Chumash perform
vastly different tasks within a narrative discourse. All conditional clauses
qualify and limit the message of the associated main clause(s). However, only
initial conditionals clauses serve as pivotal points in the organization of
information within the discourse. We saw several ways in which they
contribute to the development of a discourse: they introduce options and
alternatives to one or more choices given earlier in the discourse, they may
introduce information that contrasts with information given earlier in the
discourse, they may repeat claims, they may serve to exemplify a preceding
generalization, or they may establish a background setting for the rest of the
narrative. In these capacities, conditional clauses constitute unchallenged
hypothetical contexts that serve as a framework for interpreting ensuing
propositions.
         The Barbareho data further support the crosslinguistic generalization,
first noted by Haiman (1978), that conditional clauses and topics, e.g. topical
NPs, share fundamental similarities. Both are similar in marking in that they
tend overwhelmingly to be followed by the topical marker 2i=. Secondly, all
topical NPs and almost all conditional clauses occur preposed to associated                                              455
material, and in that position they establish frames of reference and
interpretation for ensuing information.
        Conditional clauses that do not have such global roles in the discourse
tend to occur in final position. In Barbareho Chumash, certain factors or
environments appear to motivate the final position of a conditional clause. In
one environment, the main clause has other associated preposed material,
such as a left-dislocated NP or another adverbial clause, which is already
serving as a guidepost for the interpretation of the information that follows it.
In another environment the main clause might be embedded. In such cases,
the conditional clause does not intervene between its embedded main clause
and the verb or noun that heads that embedded clause. In other cases, the
main clause clause may be conjoined with one or more (preceding) clauses
which name a set of related actions or situations. The flow of information is
being organized through these independent clauses. A preposed conditional
clause in such cases would disrupt the smooth flow of information. Finally, in
some environments, postposed conditional clauses serve as afterthoughts to
already-completed utterances. In all these cases, final conditional clauses serve
only to qualify or complete the message of their associated main clauses.","[476, 477, 478]"

        This dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareno Chumash, an indigenous language of California. It explores the
semantic relations, morphosyntactic structure, and discourse functions of
adverbial clauses in this language, with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses crosslinguistically, and from a functionally-
oriented approach to linguistics. Almost all of the data come from narratives
recorded in the 1950s by John Harrington from Mary Yee, the last speaker of
the Barbareho Chumash language.
        The dissertation is divided into five parts. Part I is the preliminaries. It
includes a detailed grammatical sketch of the Barbareno Chumash language.
In Part II I analyze the semantic and morphosyntactic characteristics of
thirteen structurally-distinguishable adverbial clause types. The adverbial
clauses    code    temporal,   conditional,     concessive,    purposive,   reason/causal,
manner, and semantically neutral relations. Semantically neutral adverbial
clauses have both temporal and conditional meanings, and though most
researchers treat such clauses as conditional, in this study I treat them as a
category separate from the temporal and conditional categories. In Part TI I
compare the initial and final tokens of these clause types with respect to
similarities      and   differences    in       structure,    extent   of    scope,    and
punctuation/prosodic boundaries. In Part IV I focus on the similarities and
differences in discourse functions between initial and final clauses that code
purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral relations. In addition
to their qualifying role, the initial adverbial clauses function as pivotal points
of orientation that help create a cohesive and coherent text. However, the
final adverbial clauses only serve to qualify the main clause. They do not
function as pivotal points of orientation in a discourse. These differences
between initial and final adverbial clauses are found crosslinguistically, and
reflect the general cognitive processes involved in the production and
comprehension of discourse (Giv6n 1995). Finally, I conclude this study with
the closing remarks in Part V.                                                               ,                                              viii

1.1 Purpose of this study
         This dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareho Chumash, an indigenous language of California. The goals of the
dissertation are two-fold. First, it describes what adverbial clauses look like in
this language, sorting them into types that correspond to certain structural
criteria. Second, it explores discourse-functional explanations for the ways in
which the adverbial clauses pattern as they do in Barbareho Chumash
narratives. Both of these goals are met with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses cross-linguistically, in both their grammatical
and discourse-functional properties.
         Much has been published on adverbial clauses. Almost all studies on
adverbial clauses, however, use constructed sentences for data. Relatively few
studies have examined adverbial clauses within the context of non-constructed,
connected discourse, such as monologic narratives and conversation. This
dissertation not only examines adverbial clauses from a discourse context, but
it also provides a rare, in-depth look at adverbial clauses in an American
Indian language. For the reasons cited above, this study aims to be a worthy
contribution to the cross-linguistic literature on adverbial clauses and, more
generally, to discourse-functional perspectives on language.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

       PURP         everyone      3-IDF-~FUT-venerate
       so that all will respect him as a person. 'In (9) above, the main clause is in line f. It is followed by two Gukanu
clauses: a same-subject Gukanu clause in g. and a different-subject Cukanu
clause in h. The same-subject clause in g. did not retain the subject pronoun
s~, but the pronoun for the different-subject clause in h. is retained. The
reason again has to do with whether or not the main clause subject has
control. As has been pointed out, those who wear the bear claw talisman can
become strong, at will, by using the bear claw talisman. The same-subject
éukanu clause in g. reflects this control by the suppression of the subject
pronoun. The ones who wear the bear claw talisman do not, however, have
control over whether people have respect for them or hold them in high
esteem. The different-subject adverbial clause reflects this by retaining the
third person subject pronoun s-. Possibly a very strong person could threaten
others and thereby force them to act respectfully. If such were the case, one
would expect that the subject pronoun s~ would not be retained in the
adverbial clause. That is, one would expect to see *?amsa?2suku instead of
the attested samsa?suku in line h.
        Another instance in which the main clause subject does not have full
control is given in (10). The example is from a narrative about a man who
wanted to give the appearance of having many lovers. Though the main clause
subject has control over how much he scratches himself up (=the main clause
event), he does not have control over the extent to which the scratches make
him look, in the eyes of others, to be the favorite of women (= adverbial
clause event). In fact, the point of the story is the humorous irony that, in
spite of his efforts, he did not fool anyone; everyone instead thought that he
was simply half crazy. The main clause in question is a relative clause with the
meaning 'who used to scratch himself up'. The Head NP, hi=1=2ihiy ‘a
man', has a grammatical role of subject in its relative clause. The referent is
indexed on the verb 'scratch up oneself' with the third person subject prefix
s-. The different-subject Gukanu adverbial clause 'so that it would appear
they (women) like him very much' has pronominal marking with the third
person s— on the verb uxwal 'to resemble, to appear'.","[288, 289]"
"1.9.2.2 Neutral relations
        Sometimes none of the three criteria discussed above for temporal
clauses apply, nor does the context render a specific semantic interpretation.
In such cases, the would-be temporal clause can also have a conditional
meaning. Adverbial clauses in these cases are semantically neutral with respect
to conditionality and time. Two examples of neutralized adverbial clauses, a
na clause and a mali clause, are seen below in (6).",[42]
"                                              438
        In the short narrative in (15), Yee states the generalization that her
ancestors believed it was bad to throw away food (lines a. and b.). The
conditional clause in line c. introduces a hypothetical case in which there is a
potential for food to be wasted, ie.,          tif beans fell on the floor', The two
clauses that follow then tell what one should do to avoid wasting food in such
a case and why one should do it.","[460, 461]"
"                                       558
        In coding conditional/neutral relations, languages differ in the extent to
which their adverbial conjunctions code degrees of hypotheticality and the
speaker’s expectation about the likelihood that an event can or will occur.
English codes the distinction with two conjunctions: if and when. The
conjunction if indicates a lower degree of probability and expectation, or
higher degree of hypotheticality, and the conjunction when indicates a higher
degree of probability and expectation, or lower degree of hypotheticality. On
the other hand, Barbareho Chumash has three adverbial conjunctions that
code distinctions of hypotheticality and expectation. Events that denote the
lowest probability of ever occurring (= highest degree of hypotheticality) are
coded with the conjunction haku ‘if'. Events that have the most probability
of occurring (= lowest degree of hypotheticality) are coded with the
conjunction mali 'when'. Events that fall in the middle of the scale of
probability, expectation and hypotheticality are coded with the conjunction na
‘if; when'.   In   addition   to   these   three   conjunctions,   there   is   a fourth
conjunction, wa ‘if; when', that explicitly codes the fact that the speaker is
not taking a stance regarding any expectation or probability that an event can
occur or will occur. Thus in terms of the variety of adverbial conjunctions that
can code a speaker’s stance with regard to hypotheticality and probability,
Barbareho Chumash is more explicit than English.
         It is not surprising that languages may differ in the number of adverbial
conjunctions they use to code semantic relations, and in the finer or broader
distinctions they may make within such relations. These differences arise from
circumstances that are unique to each language in its history of use by a
community of speakers. On the other hand, as discussed in part IV, languages
show striking similarities in the ways that initial adverbial clauses build a
discourse, creating coherence among units of a text. The reason for these
similarities is that the coherence in the text reflects the coherence in the
cognitive processes that produce and comprehend the text, processes that all
humans share (see Givdn 1995 chapter 8, and the references to the
psychological literature he cites therein). I would therefore predict that further
case studies on adverbial clauses in other languages will prove to follow in this
pattern: that differences with other languages will be found in the more
localized, language-specific details of how the semantic relations are coded,
and similarities will be found in the more global, universal areas of the kinds
of tasks that initial and final adverbial clauses perform in the constructing of
a discourse.","[580, 581]"
"20.3 Summary
         Initial and final purpose clauses in Barbareno Chumash differ vastly in
the kinds of work they do in narrative discourse. These differences in function
 are further reflected in differences in scope, frequency and structure.
   .     Initial purpose clauses in Barbareno typically have a global, textual role
in the organization of discourse. The context that precedes an initial purpose
clause gives rise to certain assumptions or expectations, either explicitly or
implicitly, which are then addressed by the purpose clause in the form of a
proposition that states a goal or problem to be solved. The purpose clause
then serves as a point of orientation for the procedure or solution conveyed
by the clauses that follow it. The purpose clause thus contextualizes the
information that follows it with the information that precedes it. Much less
frequently, an initial purpose clause will not so much serve as a guidepost but
rather as an alternative or contrasting option. Significantly, all initial purpose
clauses are followed by the topic marker 2i= in the immediately succeeding
main clause, underscoring the thematic role that the purpose clause is
endowed with. A further indication of the global role that initial purpose
clauses may have is
their extent of scope. In this study they had an average scope of 6.38 clauses,
and in two cases the scope extended beyond 10 clauses.
         Final purpose clauses have a local, semantic function within narrative
discourse. They code the purpose for the action that occurs in the associated
main clause. They do not respond to assumptions and expectations raised
elsewhere in the narrative, nor do they serve as point of orientation for the
reader. This limited, local function is underscored by the limited scope that
final purpose clauses have. The Barbareho data showed that they rarely have
a scope beyond one associated clause, and even the rare exceptions never
have a scope beyond two clauses.
         Initial and final purpose clauses differ greatly in frequency: 91% of the
purpose clauses are postposed, 9% are preposed. I argued that this disparity
reflects the fact that initial purpose clauses overwhelmingly occur in
procedural narratives, while the majority of final clauses occur in non-                                       421
 procedural narratives. Procedural narratives are not a kind genre that
 commonly occurs in daily discourse, hence initial purpose clauses, which tend
 to be limited to this genre, do not occur as frequently as final purpose clauses.
         Finally, initial and final purpose clauses differ somewhat in structure.
 Initial purpose clauses belong to the na clause type only. As we saw in
 chapter 8, the na conjunction typically has the meaning ‘if' or 'when'; its
 purposive meaning is rare. Final purpose clauses never have this conjunction,
 but instead may have the dependent proclitic hi= or any one of several
 conjunctions: Gu 'so that, in order to', Gukanu        'so that, in order to', ku
 ‘so that...not; lest! and mehu 'in order to'.
         These findings give more crosslinguistic support for Thompson’s (1985)
 assertion that initial and final purpose clauses are different structures, and that
 their position in narrative discourse is iconically motivated (in relation to the
 notions of iconicity discussed in Haiman 1983). A purpose clause whose
 function is to orient the reader’s attention with respect to a certain goal or
 problem, contextualizing the solution that follows it with the assumptions and
 expectations that come before it, can only fulfill that function by following
 those clauses whose assumptions and expectations it responds to and by
 preceding those clauses that name the solution. On the other hand, a purpose
 clause whose function is simply to complete the information of its main clause
 is more easily processed following its main clause. If all that a purpose clause
 is doing is expressing the goal of a given action, then the simplest and
 cognitively easiest arrangement is for it to be postposed, because in real time
the event named by the main clause will precede the event or goal named by
 the purpose clause.","[443, 444]"

a question. An illustration of one of these is given in (5). The adverbial clause
names the hypothetical situation 'if they are not people'. The main clause
poses the question, 'what are they, then?', which underscores the irrealis
nature of the conditional relation. The main clause also has another irrealis
operator in the form of the particle kimini 'if so; in that case; then', which
only occurs in conditional relations.",[243]
"1.9.2.3 Conditional relations
       Generally, an adverbial clause that provides the condition(s) under
which the event/state in the main clause occurs is analyzed in this dissertation
as a conditional clause. However, as discussed earlier, conditional relations can
be conflated with temporal relations in Barbareno, with the result that the
clause in question may not be a true conditional clause, even if it has an
adverbial conjunction that Harrington translates as ‘if’. In identifying a                                                 21
conditional clause, then, I looked for the following factors: (i) the adverbial
clause must code a hypothetical, i.e. unreal, situation; and, (ii) the main clause
must have one or more of the following features (following Givén 1990:829)
all of which underscore the irrealis nature of conditional constructions: the
modal verb uniyiw ‘to be necessary, to have to, should', the modal verb
alaqway      ‘can, to be able', the future tense prefix sa?-, the modal particle
may ‘would, should', a marker of certainty such as the particle pa ‘must be,
must have', the hortative particle kuhhe 'let it not be (that)', the particle
kimini 'then (in that case)', an imperative verb, an indirect request, or a
question. Negation in the main clause was another criterion I considered, since
in some languages all clauses that have negation are treated as irrealis (T.
Payne 1997). I decided not to treat negation as one of the structural criteria
in the identification of a conditional relation. However, in those cases where
I gave a conditional interpretation based on a pragmatic interpretation of the
context, i.e. where none of the above structural criteria were found in the
associated main clause, it was almost always the case that the main clause had
negation. These judgment calls were rare, however.
        Following Givén (1990:831) a counterfactual conditional relation was
identified as one in which: (i) the adverbial clause has a firm and negative
truth-value; (ii) the adverbial clause has a realis operator such as the past
tense suffix -wa5; and finally, (iii) the main clause has an irrealis operator
such as future tense or a modal particle. Counterfactual clauses are rare in my
corpus, however.
        The passage below has several conditional clauses: a conditional na
clause (line a.), a conditional haku clause (line c.), and a counterfactual
conditional haku clause (line f.).","[43, 44]"

2.3 Syntax
        In Barbarenho, a clause with full subject and object NPs generally has
a Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) structure. Most clauses have at most one full
NP, however (Ono 1996). The verb-initial word order occurs in independent
clauses as well as dependent clauses, such as complement clauses, relative
clauses, and adverbial clauses. Preverbal NPs are pragmatically marked and
are typically not part of the clause that follows. Usually these NPs are set off
by topic or focus particles. Finally, nominalized clauses are common in
Chumash languages. These may occur as subject or object complements,
relative clauses, part of cleft constructions, or as free NPs.
        The following topics are treated in 2.3: basic clause structure (2.3.1),
two-verb predicates (2.3.2), the morphosyntax of nominalized clauses (2.3.3),
pragmatically-marked constructions (2.3.4), complement-taking predicates and
their complement clauses (2.3.5), relative clauses (2.3.6), and appositive
clauses (2.3.7). The chapter ends with examples of coordination in 2.3.8.","[90, 91]"
"12.1.1.2 Same-subject clauses in which the subject pronoun is suppressed
        Examples (5) and (6) above are the only tokens of same-subject
éukanu clauses that have subject pronouns. In both cases, the main clause
subjects have little or no control over what they undergo in the adverbial
clause event. In same-subject clauses where the main clause subject does have
total control, the adverbial clause does not have a subject pronoun. It may,
however, still index the plurality of the subject with the prefix iy-, or it may
index the indefiniteness of the subject with the prefix am-, where applicable.
Several illustrations of this pattern are given in (7) below. This excerpt is from
a text about magically powerful talismans. It tells about all the things one can
do and be when one wears a particular kind of talisman around the neck. The
excerpt has examples of same-subject and different-subject Gukanu clauses.",[285]

In these cases, the head NP has no resumptive reference in its relative clause.
An illustration of this pattern is seen in (329). The head NP is
hi=s-iy-i8-2iSnahiS-?2 'their customs'. Its corresponding NPrel is an
oblique in the relative clause hi=s-iy-leken 'that they live by'. There is
a third person subject pronoun in this relative clause, ie. s-iy-,            but that

the generalization that the early Spanish were superstitious. In either case, the                                           442
conditional clauses develop the discourse by introducing particular cases of a

"2.3.4.1 Fronting
       As we saw in 2.3.1, neutral or basic clauses in Barbareho Chumash are
verb initial. Occasionally, however, one finds in the corpus that NPs are
fronted before the verb within the clause. When fronting occurs, there is no
special ""focus"" or other kind of particle that separates the fronted NP from the
rest of the clause. Also, in Harrington’s transcriptions, no comma or other
kind of punctuation was ever found to separate the fronted NP from the rest
of the clause. Presumably, then, the fronted NP falls under a single intonation
contour with the rest of the clause. Finally, in all cases of fronting in
Barbareho, the fronted NP is an oblique. No cases of fronted core-arguments
have been found. Below are several examples of fronting.(275)     2i-ti    siytSiyik      sKili2axwil              ilé2,

2.3.4.2  Left-dislocation
        Barbareno Chumash has two different kinds of constructions in which
an NP is left-dislocated. In both cases, the NP is not part of the clause that
follows it. In the first construction, the particle/proclitic 2i=, which in
Chumashan linguistics is traditionally referred to as a topic marker, intervenes
between the left-dislocated NP and the following clause. The clause that
follows 2i= may make either implicit or explicit reference to the left-
dislocated NP. The left-dislocated NP the gatherer of the datura plant in (279)
below is co-referential with the third person subject pronoun, s-, on the verb
?i=s-us2elus 's/he digs it (a hole)'. Referents of left-dislocated NPs that
precede the topicalizer ?i= remain the topic for a portion of text, however
long or short that portion may be.","[104, 105]"

2.3.6Relative clause constructions
      Relative clauses are syntactically-dependent clauses that modify a head
noun (head NP). In the sentence they finally caught the man who robbed the
bank, the head NP is the man and the relative clause is whe robbed the bank.
This relative clause is postnominal; it follows its head NP the man. The
relativizer is who; it links the relative clause to its head NP. The head NP has
the grammatical role of object in its main clause: it is the object of the verb
'caught'. The NPrel, or relative-clause co-referent of the head NP, has the
grammatical role of subject: it is the subject of the verb 'robbed'.
         Relative clauses in Barbareho Chumash have the following features.
First, all relative clauses are postnominal. Second, they are linked to the head
noun via the dependent proclitic hi=. Exceptions are rare. Third, all of the
grammatical role positions available in Barbareho can be relativized. Thus
subjects, objects, and obliques--including possessors--can be relativized. Finally,
the grammar of relativization is sensitive to the distinction between core
argument NPrels and oblique NPrels. With rare exception, core-argument
NPrels, i.e. subjects and objects, always occur in nominalized relative clauses.
Only about 60% of the relative clauses with oblique NPrels, however, are
nominalized..
       Below are two sets of near-minimal] pairs that show some differences
between a basic clause and a relative clause construction in Barbareho
Chumash. In (320)b the relative clause is a Subject-relative, because the NPrel
of the head NP ‘ash tree' has the grammatical role of subject in the relative
clause 'that stood near the door of his house '. The third person pronoun s-
is not retained   in the relative clause. As we     saw    in 2.3.3.1,   however,   in
Barbareho Chumash it is normal for nominalized clauses, including relative
clauses, not to retain the third person subject pronoun.(320)

          near the door of his house>. 59.0496  In (321)b, the relative clause is an Object-relative, because the relative clause
  co-referent of 'rocks' has the grammatical role of object in the relative clause
   ‘that they can throw at one another'. Note that the third person plural object
  -wun is not suffixed to the relative clause verb in (321)b, but neither is it
  suffixed to the main clause verb in (321) a. More study needs to be done on
  where, when and why the plural object suffix -wun appears. This suffix most

         Like the relative clause in (321), the relative clause in (322) is an
Object-relative. Structurally they are very different, however. Example (322)
illustrates the only relative-clause token in the analyzed corpus that has a
relativizer in the form of ka=. Like the contrastive focus marker and stative
proclitic of the same form, the relativizer ka= is a reflex of the proto-
Chumash demonstrative *ka. The relative clause construction has a similar
form to the cleft construction illustrated earlier in (284), with the important
exception that the relative clause is not nominalized.","[115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"

12.1.3 Subject marking in discontinuous Gukanu clauses
        Though it rarely happens, sometimes another adverbial clause will
intervene between the Gukanu conjunction and the rest of the Gukanu
clause. The result is a discontinuous Gukanu clause. In these cases, the verb
of the Gukanu-clause proper will have a subject pronoun, even if the main
clause subject has full control over the Gukanu clause subject. The Gukanu
clause in these cases still has the future tense prefix sa?-, just as it would
without the other intervening adverbial clause. One can get a better
understanding of how this occurs with the following minimal pair of adverbial
clause constructions. The two members of this contrasting pair come from
different narratives about the particular kind of wooden bowl called a stuk.
The example in (13), reintroduced as (15) below, shows an uninterrupted,
continuous Gukanu clause. This Gukanu clause serves as the main clause to
the wa 'when' adverbial clause that follows it in line c. The uninterrupted

       they had the big locks and keys.’One cannot literally lock a door by simply saying ""I am going to use a key"".
Thus the initial purpose clause in line b. above does not express a literal
purpose. Rather, it functions as a link between the implicit expectation set up
in line a. and the propositions expressed in lines c. and d. In line a., we learn
that the Barbareho people used words borrowed from Spanish when talking
about locks, keys, and any activity associated with locks and keys. The
propositions in lines c. and d. give the solution, in the form of an example of
how the Barbareno people actually used Spanish when talking about locking
up. (The word yawe 'key' in line d. is a borrowing from Spanish.) As
Thompson notes, non-literal purpose clauses in English are never found in
postposed position. The same is true for Barbareno Chumash. The reason
again is that the non-literal purpose clause is functioning as a link between
implicit expectations or needs set up in the preceding discourse and the
 ‘solution that follows. Purpose clauses in final position do not perform this
role.
        Initial purpose clauses that help establish a chain of sequential events
always have a global, discourse-organizing role. Not all initial purpose clauses
have this function, however. One function not noted in Thompson’s study, but
one which is relevant to Barbareno, is that an initial purpose clause may name
an option that contrasts with another option given in the preceding context.
Such contrasts can be local. The initial purpose clause in that case may have
a scope of only one main clause. For example, the initial purpose clause in
(9), line d., has a much more local than global role within the discourse, and                                            411

the ranch' that serves as an option to the goal 'to go to Mass"" given in the
preceding clause. Naming options is a function that has been noted for initial
conditional clauses (e.g. Ford and Thompson 1986), but not for initial purpose
clauses. Both the purpose clause and its main clause of line d. have structural
properties that reinforce the contrast between the two options. First, in line                                           412
 d., the purpose clause has the conjunction 2ikPy 'but', a conjunction that
marks the proposition that follows it as contrastive. Second, there is a contrast
in the kind of purposive clauses used: the purpose clause in line d. is preposed
 and has the adverbial conjunction na; the purpose clause immediately above
it in line c. is a postposed, conjunctionless purpose clause. Both of these name
 alternative goals. The final purpose clause in line c. names the goal 'to go to
Mass', the initial purpose clause in line d. names the goal 'to cart off grass
from the ranch '. Finally, the main clauses in lines c. and e. illustrate two kinds
of pragmatically-marked clause structures in Barbareno, both of which
highlight or put into focus the NP that immediately precedes the main clause
verb. The main clause in line c. puts into focus the NP 'carretas' (seen in line
b.), the main clause in line e. puts into focus the NP 'sledge'. These
structural properties underscore the rather local, contrastive/option-naming
function of the initial na purpose clause in line d.
         The example in (9) notwithstanding, the data on initial purpose clauses
in Barbareho support the findings in Thompson in 1985 for English. First, they
tend to have a large scope. The initial purpose clause in (1), for example, has
a scope of over 10 clauses, not counting the tangential asides in lines d. and
h. As was done in Thompson’s 1985 study, those clauses that serve as part of
the solution or procedure were counted as being within the scope of the initial
purpose clause. In Thompson’s study, the average scope of an initial purpose
clause was 3.18 (1985:76); for Barbareno Chumash the average is 6.38 clauses.
As we will see in 20.2, however, final purpose clauses rarely have a scope
beyond the immediately preceding clause. The large scope that most initial
purpose clauses in Barbareno have reinforces Thompson’s assertion that initial
purpose clauses serve as marked themes (following Fries 1983), directing the
reader’s attention in a specific but subtle way (1985:61,67). In Barbareho, the
fact that most initial purpose clauses are thematic or topic-like is underscored
by the fact that all such clauses are followed by the topic marker 2i= (in the
immediately following main clause), as Table 49 on the following page shows.","[432, 433, 434, 435]"

"1.5 Theoretical orientation
         This dissertation is based on a functionally-oriented approach to
linguistics. A functionally-oriented approach seeks to understand language in
all of its cognitive, communicative, socio-cultural and diachronic aspects. It is
the complex way in which these aspects of language interact that accounts for
the patterns observed in human languages, both individually and on a cross-
linguistic basis. The complex interaction of these aspects of language is best
seen in the ways language is actually used. Hence, when linguists who follow
this approach seek to describe and explain why certain forms or structures
pattern as they do in a given language, they want to work with as much
context of the language as possible. They seek to have a database that is built
upon connected discourse rather than only single forms and structures elicited
out of context, the latter being the standard for some schools of linguistics.
Thus if the language under investigation has a community of speakers, a
functionally-oriented linguist will seek to record as many genres of naturally
occurring discourse as possible, including conversation and the telling of
stories. Such recordings are audiotaped and/or videotaped, and are
subsequently transcribed in a systematic way (e.g. Du Bois et al. 1993). From
such data, both qualitative analyses (e.g. Chafe 1980) and quantitative analyses                                        5
(e.g. Givén 1983, Du Bois 1987, Fox and Thompson 1990 and Ford 1993
among many others) are possible.
        One broad area of functional approaches to linguistics that is used in
this dissertation is the theory of INFORMATION FLOW (Chafe       1976, 1987,   1992,
 1994). According to this theory, the changing cognitive state of information in
the minds of the speaker and hearer motivate particular linguistic forms and
structures. For example, newly mentioned referents are commonly coded as
full NPs, because in this form the hearer is able to identify who the speaker
is talking about. Subsequent mentions of the same referent usually take
pronominal form, e.g. English 'he', 'she', 'it'. These forms of the referent
reflect its Given cognitive status. This theory is particularly helpful in part four
of this dissertation as we examine the relationship between mentions of
referents and clausal ordering in adverbial clause constructions.
        The theory of information flow is connected to some extent to the
principle of least effort in the production and processing of language (Zipf
1935). This principle, along with the functionally-oriented notion of iconic and
economic motivation in language (Haiman 1983) will be shown to be relevant
in understanding the various patterns one finds with initial and final adverbial
clauses in Barbareno discourse, in parts three and four of the dissertation.","[27, 28]"

        Crosslinguistically, we find that preposed and postposed adverbial
clauses may differ in morphosyntactic structure (Givén 1990). The differences
always point to the general tendency for postposed clauses, more so than
preposed clauses, to have a tighter semantic bond with their main clauses. For
the Barbareno Chumash language, differences in morphosyntactic patterning
are best examined in terms of two categories of adverbial clause types: (i)
those clause types that have both preposed and postposed tokens; and, (ii)
those clause types that have only postposed tokens, or an overwhelming
tendency toward postposed tokens. For the relevant clause types in group (ii),
the relationship between morphosyntactic patterning and bondedness with the
main clause was dealt with in part II of the dissertation. A brief recapitulation
of the findings will be given in 18.1. The clause types in group (i) will be the
focus of 18.2. A summary follows in 18.318.1 Clause types that are mostly postposed
         In some of the clause types that are postposed there was a reduction
in pronominal subject marking. For the Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clause
type in chapter 12 and the one purposive ehu 'in order to' clause token in
chapter 15, the loss or retention of the subject pronoun was motivated by the
semantics of agency and control. The greater the control on the part of the
main clause subject (which was always an agent), the greater chance there was
that the adverbial clause would not have a subject pronoun. We saw that the
adverbial clause subject pronoun was retained, however, when the main clause
subject did not have full control over the situation coded by the adverbial
clause. The loss of subject marking in the adverbial clause could happen
whether the adverbial clause and main clause had same subjects or different
subjects. In other clause types that tend to be postposed, especially the kayké
""because ' reason clauses and the kaheé ' like, as if' manner clauses, we saw
that reduction in pronominal subject marking was found mainly in same-
subject adverbial clauses. This pattern reflects the fact that final, same-subject
adverbial clauses tend to have a tighter semantic bond with their main clauses
than postposed, different-subject adverbial clauses.","[386, 387]"

       Table 43 shows that, for all but one clause type (fnehu 'because, since,
from'), the majority of initial clauses are followed by some sort of punctuation
that, presumably, indicates separation from the main clause. For six out of the
nine clause tynes that have initial tokens, 75% or more of the initial tokens
are followed by a comma. In the two cases in which the adverbial clause is
punctuated with a colon, the adverbial clause is immediately followed by
quoted speech. Both of these tokens are na ‘iffwhen' clauses that occur in
the same narrative. In both cases a line of quoted speech intervenes between
the adverbial clauses (line b. and f.) and their main clauses (line d. and h.).","[397, 398, 399]"

       The punctuation in reason clauses, both in Barbareho        and English,
contrasts significantly with the adverbial clauses that code other semantic
relations. For example, in Barbarenho, whereas 57% of the final reason clauses
 are preceded by punctuation, such is the case for only 25% of the final
temporal clauses, One reason for this distributional bias is that final temporal
clauses have a more local semantic function, one whose purpose is to
complete the meaning of the preceding main clause, or otherwise provide
temporal or situational grounding, rather than have a more global, discourse-
organizational role. On the other hand, as has been noted previously, final
reason clauses may have a more global scope. They are much more likely to
reflect that larger scope by having a prosodic/punctuation boundary. Ford
(1992 and 1993) gives another reason for the tendency to find pauses before
causal/reason clauses. These clauses tend to be less planned than (final)
temporal clauses, and hence are not tied as smoothly to the preceding,
associated material as are final temporal clauses (1993:92,93). This, too, is
mirrored in Barbareho by the fact that 30% (15 out of 50 tokens) of the
reason clauses are syntactically discontinuous--a situation in which a NP
constituent or even another clause intervenes between the reason clause
conjunction and the rest of the reason clause. However, only one of the
conditional clauses was found to be discontinuous, and none of the temporal
and neutral clauses were found to be discontinuous.
        The Barbareno Chumash data also affirm Ford’s (1992) finding that
temporal clauses have a greater degree of bondedness with the modified
material than conditional clauses. This pattern holds in Barbarenho for both
initial and final tokens of these two semantic relations. Looking at initial
clauses in Table 47, we see that 68% of the conditional clauses are set off
from the modified material by punctuation, compared to 51% of the temporal
clauses. Looking at final clauses in Table 48, we see that 42% of the
conditional clauses are separated by punctuation, compared to 25% of the
temporal clauses. What is particularly striking is that the difference in the
percentage is exactly 17%, for the initial clauses as well as for the final
clauses. When these findings are taken together with the fact that a greater
percentage (57%) of final reason clauses are separated by punctuation than
either final temporal clauses or final conditional clauses, the Barbareno
Chumash data further substantiate Ford’s (1992) claim that there are cognitive
and communicative reasons for the differences in the degree to which
temporal, conditional, and reason clauses are bound to their associated
material:
                                      392
        'It may be that temporal qualification is more essential
       to the meaning of an assertion both in terms of how it is
       organized cognitively and in how it is presented to a
       listener/reader. To understand and communicate information
       about an event or state, we seem to treat its temporal grounding
       as more crucial than its conditional or causal circumstances.
       This then may be mapped directly onto the system of signaling
       connection, be it punctuation or intonation."" (1992:14)         In Barbareho Chumash as in other languages, final purpose clauses are
much more likely than initial purpose clauses to lack a punctuation boundary
with the main clause: 59% of the final purpose clauses lack a punctuation
boundary, compared with 37% of the initial purpose clauses. Since there are
so few initial purpose clause tokens, the difference is not statistically
significant. However, the difference in punctuation could have some relation
to the fact that final purpose clauses have a more localized scope than initial
purpose clauses (Thompson 1985). Issues concerning the relationship among
semantics, position and discourse function of purpose clauses are further
explored in part IV.
       In sum, Harrington’s use of punctuation reveals patterns that reflect
prosodic and punctuation boundaries found in adverbial clause constructions
in other languages. Harrington’s use of punctuation marks is consistent enough
to conclude that these reflect prosodic boundaries in Mary Yee’s speech.","[413, 414, 415]"

However, given the more nominal marking on the verb with the dependent
clitic hi= and the distal deictic clitic ho?=, this siy- is probably the third
person plural possessive prefix commonly found on nouns and nominal
themes, rather than the third person plural subject siy- that is prefixed to
verbal themes.
        Two of the final 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause tokens do not have
subject marking because the adverbial clause subject is third person singular,
and the verb has the stative prefix 2al-. As noted previously, the third person
subject pronoun is never found prefixed to that stative morpheme. The first
example of this, for a postposed 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause, was seen
in (5) with the verb 2al-wulaéu 'STV-be.drunk'. In the postposed
?akimpi clause in (10) there is no third person subject pronoun s— on the
verb 2aleken 'to be alive' in line e. This verb is a lexicalization of the
stative prefix 2al- and the verb leken                'to stay; be seated; live'. The main
clause itself (second part of line d.) happens to be a nominalized clause, thus
it does not have subject marking either.","[168, 169]"

        Other initial neutral clauses are found in very brief textlets. In these
cases, the position of the neutral clause has more to do with the demands of
referent tracking than with anything else. In all cases the neutral clause
introduces a referent, a core argument, that is coded with a full NP. This
referent is subsequently the subject or object argument in the clauses that
follow. For example, in the textlet in (20), the neutral clause in line b.
introduces the subject NP 'the swordfish', which is also the subject of the
main clause in line c.","[556, 557]"
"       Exploring options and alternatives is the most common function that
Barbareno Chumash conditional clauses were found to have in my corpus:
Out of the 76 preposed tokens, 31 (41%) have this role. Example (3) presents
an entire text about the kinds of animals one could have for a spirit helper or
talisman, referred to as 2atiSwin in the Barbareno Chumash language. The
structure of this narrative is centered around the choices of animals that one
could have for an 2atiSwin. The preferred choice (Prairie Falcon) is coded
by a superlative clause in line b. Four alternatives are then offered in lines d.
(Snake), g. (Skunk), k. (Rabbit) and n. (Bear). Each alternative is coded by
ana ‘if’ conditional clause. These conditionals have an unusual predicate
nominal form, of which more will be said later.",[447]

the adverbial clause conjunction itself introduced a lengthy or discontinuous
unit. The preceding main clause would be punctuated even if it was short,
consisting of a verb only. Presumably in these instances the information
conveyed by the adverbial clause and its adjoined material would be
prosodically separated from the preceding main clause or modified material
(e.g. as noted in Ford 1993 and Hengeveld 1998 for reason clauses). An

       <he says blessings in the church.>        None of the 13 adverbial clause types showed a significant correlation
between punctuation and same/different subjecthood, for either initial or final
position. For Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clauses in particular, no
significant   correlation   was    found   between     punctuation      and _ the
presence/absence of a subject pronoun in the adverbial clause. My initial
hypothesis had been that punctuation patterns would reflect the stronger
semantic bonds that come with identical reference or with total control of the
main clause subject (in the case of Gukanu purpose clauses). This did not
turn out to be the case.
        Tables 47 and 48 show the distribution of punctuation in initial and
final clauses by semantic relation. The patterns in the data reflect the findings
in Ford 1992, 1993, Givén 1990, Ramsey 1987, Chafe 1984 and Quirk et al.
1985 in several respects. First, echoing what we saw in Tables 43 and 46, final
clauses (62%) are more likely than initial clauses (42%) to have no                                             388
punctuation intervening between the adverbial clause and main clause. Put in
another way, preposed clauses (58%) are more likely than postposed clauses
(38%) to be separated from the main clause by punctuation. If Harrington’s
punctuation is a general reflection of prosodic boundaries as he heard them
in Yee’s speech, then the Barbareho Chumash data confirm Chafe 1984, in
which it was found that intonationally-bound adverbial clauses tend to be
postposed, and preposed adverbial clauses are more likely to be intonationally
separated from the main clause. However, the Barbareho data do not mirror
his finding that intonationally-bound adverbial clauses are less common than
free adverbial clauses (Chafe 1984, for English adverbial clauses). As was
shown in Table 42, these two groups are roughly half and half in the
Barbareho Chumash data: 51% are bound (i.e. not separated from their
modified material by punctuation), and 49% are free, with punctuation
intervening between the adverbial clause and its modified material.","[409, 410, 411]"

With so few tokens involving the indefinite third person, it is not clear why the
indefinite pronoun s-am- appears in the éu clause in (14) but not in the éu
clause in (13).
        The other three exceptional tokens show an absence of the third
singular pronoun s- on the Gu clause verb. These tokens are seen below in
(15) through (17). In each case, the main clause subject has more control over
the situation than the adverbial clause subject. However, as will become clear,
the issue of control is not what motivates the absence of person marking on
the Gu clause verb. An explanation of why the person affix is missing will be
given following the presentation of examples (15) through (17).
        In (15) line b., the main clause subject is a shaman who took steps to
rid a house of a ghost. The ghost is the adverbial clause subject in line c.",[271]

        My general characterization of a prototypical adverbial clause is as
follows. First, an adverbial clause exists in a hypotactically dependent
relationship with one or more clauses. A HyPOTACTIC CLAUSE is one that is
dependent on a main clause but which is not embedded in the main clause.
As noted in Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, hypotactic dependence is an
important feature that distinguishes adverbial clauses from other kinds of
subordinate clauses, such as object- or subject complements and restrictive
relative clauses, which are embedded in their main clause. Thus a complement
clause is either a subject or object argument of a main clause verb, but an
adverbial clause is never an argument. A restrictive relative clause is a
constituent that makes up part of a larger noun phrase, but an adverbial
clause never serves as a constituent of a noun phrase.
        Second, unlike other kinds of hypotactically dependent clauses, such as
non-restrictive relative clauses and clauses of reported speech (the latter is not
to be confused with clauses of quoted speech), an adverbial clause can
normally appear before or after the main clause without a change in meaning.
Finally, as traditionally defined for two-clause constructions, an adverbial
clause is one that modifies another clause or sentence. As seen in the
literature review section, however, sentential modification does not begin to
 describe the kinds of functions an adverbial clause may have.
         A PREPOSED or initial adverbial clause is one that occurs before its main
 clause. A postroseEp or final adverbial clause is one that follows its main clause.
         Following now are general definitions and characterizations I use for
 the traditional terms that denote the semantic relation between an adverbial
 clause and its main clause. These definitions and characterizations are
 extrapolated from discussions in Thompson and Longacre 1985, Matthiessen
 and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990 and Ford 1993. A Tempora_ relation is one
 in which the event named by the main clause is anchored to the time of the
 event named by the adverbial clause. In a conpiTIonaL relation, the adverbial
 clause provides the condition(s) under which the event named by the main
 clause holds. Sometimes the semantic relation is conflated with respect to
 conditionality and time. I refer to such relations and the adverbial clauses that
 code them as NEUTRAL. In a concsssive relation, the adverbial clause expresses
 a situation that, from the narrator’s or protagonist’s point of view, would
‘under normal circumstances detract from or mitigate the situation expressed
 in the main clause. Or, as Thompson and Longacre (1985:198) state, it ""makes
 a concession against which the proposition in the main clause is contrasted.""
 In a purpose relation, the adverbial clause provides a purpose for which the
 event in the main clause is undertaken. Importantly however, as noted in                                         12
Thompson and Longacre 1985:185, the situation expressed in the adverbial
clause must be unrealized at the time of the event expressed in the main
clause. This restriction is a crucial difference between purpose and REASON
relations. In the latter, the situation in the adverbial clause is the reason for
the situation that obtains in the main clause, and it may already be realized
by the time the situation expressed by the main clause has occurred. Finally,
in a MANNER relation, the adverbial clause specifies the manner in which the
action or event of the main clause occurs.
        The foregoing are non-language-specific definitions for the semantic
categories of adverbial clauses analyzed in this dissertation. In section 1.9.2 I
discuss the methodology I use to determine which Barbareho adverbial clauses
have which of the semantic relations discussed above.","[33, 34, 35]"
"12.1.4 Exceptional cases
        There are a few baffling Gukanu clause tokens that do not fit any of
the patterns discussed above with regard to subject marking. These tokens are
especially troubling because it appears that Harrington changed his
transcription. He seems to have inserted a subject pronoun into the verb in
question, a pronoun that should not be there given the patterns of control and
                                               275
