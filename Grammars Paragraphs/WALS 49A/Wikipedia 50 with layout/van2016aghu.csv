      Dixon stresses that case may be expressed in different ways: either as affixes (ideally
and typically called case inflection, or as clitics (ideally called case clitics, typically called
case or apposition), or — as is the case in Aghu — as grammatical words, in which case
they are ideally called case words, and typically called adpositions. This book uses the
term postpositional case marker, to express both its realization as a grammatical word that
directly follows the NP and to express its function as a case marker.

te ‘NOM’                  Nominative case marker, used to mark a subject
ke(mu) ‘ACC’              Accusative case marker, used to mark a patient, recipient,
                          target, location or (certain) temporal expressions
ni ‘DAT’                  Dative case marker, used e.g. to mark a beneficiary, a
                          purpose, an addressee (but see below), or a non-patient-like
                          complement of certain verbs
fini / namu ‘INSTR’       Instrumental case marker, used to mark an instrument or
                          source material. Also used in certain temporal expressions
kumu ‘COM’                Comitative case marker
Before coming to a one by one discussion, it is helpful to first give some
general properties of the postpositional case markers listed above, to
delineate them from members of other word classes. The defining
properties of the markers above are the following:
       -   They appear in final position of the phrase.
       -   They mark the syntactic or semantic relation between the noun
           phrase and the verbal predicate.
       -   Their use is generally optional, at least in certain contexts.179178
      In his discussion of “schakelelementen” Drabbe also mentions maga, used only in
combination with to ‘opening’ (Drabbe 1957:43a). To maga, then, is translated by Drabbe
as ‘in the opening’ or ‘at the door’. This maga is probably better analyzed as spatial noun
(3.5.2), rather than as a postpositional case marker.
179
      Here we are limited because of a lack of data, and suffer especially from the lack of
data obtained from independent fieldwork. One of the most straightforward ways to find
out whether a morpheme is optional, is to present an informant with both options, and ask
for the acceptability and meaning of both cases. Given that we lack this type of data, we
may conclude that the use of a morpheme is optional only in those cases where Drabbe´s
corpus happens to provide contrasting examples. And even then we do not know whether
there might be a subtle meaning difference going along with the use or non-use of the
morpheme in question.
242                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
The case markers te and ke were dealt with in 3.1.7, where it was shown
that they answer all three criteria mentioned here: they are used
postnominally, they mark the (semantic or) syntactic relation between the
predicate and the noun, and their use is optional. We now turn to a
discussion of the other postpositional case markers.","[258, 259, 260]"

Drabbe s terminology
The list below is meant as a help for those who want to use Drabbe’s
original publication. While the relation between Drabbe’s terminology and
the one used in this publication can often be found through the use of a
dictionary, in certain cases the relation is less straightforward. It is these
cases that have been mentioned in the list below.","[844, 845, 846, 847, 848, 849, 850, 851, 852, 853, 854, 855, 856, 857, 858, 859]"
"
When used as arguments in verbal clauses, the interrogative pronouns
behave the same as nouns. They optionally combine with the nominative or
accusative cases markers te NOM or ke ACC, as can be seen in (264) and
(265)a-c below. Note that, parallel to what we saw for full NP’s in 3.1.7, te
is used to mark either an intransitive subject (as in (264)) or a transitive
subject (as in (265)a and b), while ke is used to mark an object. As is clear
from (265)a-c, the function of the case marker is to disambiguate between
different syntactic roles. The fact, however, that it is also possible to use a
case marker in (264) — where the syntactic role of meoxo is not ambiguous
— shows that it must also have a pragmatic function.154(264)       meoxo    (te)       da-xe
            who      (NOM)      come-N1.RLS[SG]

(265)a      meoxo     ü-ge
            who       stab-N1.RLS[SG]
            ‘Who has stabbed (someone)?’ / ‘Whom has he stabbed?’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)
b          meoxo     te      ü-ge

           ‘Who has stabbed (someone)?’ / ‘* Whom has he stabbed?’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)
154
      Cf. the discussion of te in 3.1.7, especially example (222).
200                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesc         meoxo     ke      ü-ge

          ‘*Who has stabbed someone?’ / Whom has he stabbed)?’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)
As can be seen in (266)a - c below, in nominal predicates, interrogative
pronouns obligatorily combine with te or ke. In this respect, they differ
from nouns, where the use of te or ke is optional. The difference between
the use of te and ke is not clear, but their function is clearly not to
differentiate between different syntactic roles. It is more likely that their use
has to do with the type of focus, but we have insufficient data to say
anything more about the respective roles of ke and te with any certainty.155(266)a     *meoxo     de
           who        COP
           * ‘who is it’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)

           who       FOC       COP
           ‘who is it’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)
155
      Interrogative pronouns are focused in the sense that they represent the ‘component of
(...) the proposition whereby the assertion [WvdH: in this case expressed by the question
word] differs from the presupposition [WvdH: the fact that there is someone]’ (cf.
Lambrecht 1994:213). This may explain the use of ke. Whereas te is not a focus marker, it
is not incompatible with focus, and it is not unthinkable that te would represent a different
tye of focus than ke, like presentational or thetic focus, with the focus on the predicate as a
whole. With the little data that we have, however, we can only speculate about this
difference.

Drabbe also gives a number of examples where the interrogative pronoun
meoxo is used to refer to the possessor in a possessive construction. First
consider (267) and (268), where the latter gives two possible answers to the
former.(267)       gu          meoxo        n-axu           de156
            2SG         who          LNK-human       COP
            ‘what clan do you belong to or where are you from?’
            (lit. ‘whose person are you?’; Drabbe 1957:27a)
(268)      Eba                     n-axu         de /        Xoxonasàfo        n-axu       de
           name.of.river           LNK-human     COP         Xoxonasàfo        LNK-human   COP
           ‘I am from the area of the Eba-river’ /
            ‘I am someone from the Xoxonasàfo clan (Drabbe 1957:27a)
Two other question-answer pairs are the following:(269)       gu     meoxo      xu       de /      gu          meoxo       siü     de
            2SG    who        man      COP       2SG         who         woman   COP
            ‘whose man are you?’ / ‘whose woman are you?’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)
(270)      Mā     xu          de      / Magubo       siü           de
           Ma     man         COP     Magubo         woman         COP
           ‘I am a man from the Mã clan’
            / ‘I am a woman from (the place) Magubo’(Drabbe 1957:27a)
Examples (271) through (273) form two final examples of interrogatives
referring to possessors. Note that (273) is an example of a possessive
construction embedded in another expression.","[217, 218, 219]"
"
In verbal clauses, pronouns and noun phrases can be followed by one of the
case markers te or ke (or kèmu / kumu, see 3.6.2 below). Te ‘NOM’ is
optionally used to mark a subject, while ke ‘ACC’ may be used to mark the
object. In this book I will use the term object for those constituents that can
be marked with ke and which bear the semantic role of patient, beneficiary
or target. In addition, ke may be used to mark a location or a temporal
expression, although we hardly have any examples of the latter use. 135
Although te and ke belong to the class of postpositional case markers that
will be discussed in 3.6, the fact that they mark the central syntactic
functions of subject and object justifies an additional discussion here. Te
and ke may be seen as having a disambiguating function, as they can easily
be left out when the context makes clear what is intended. Compare the
following examples, where the interpretation of (221a) is dependent on the
context and allows for different readings out of context, but ( b) and ( c )135
      In fact, the only example is the expression womiŋ ge / gèmu ‘in the night’ provided by
Drabbe in his discussion on kèmu, kumu and ke (Drabbe 1957:42a). Cf. 3.6.2 below.
176                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
allow for one reading only, with n-amse as a subject or an (indirect) object,
respectively.(221a)   na        n-amse               ed-oxe-nã
         1SG.POS   LNK-child            give-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘my children gave it / they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
( b)     na        n-amse          t=       ed-oxe-nã
         1SG.POS   LNK-child       NOM      give-N1.RLS-N1PL

         1SG.POS   LNK-child       ACC      give-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
While in transitive sentences like ( b) the use of te may be seen as
disambiguating, this cannot explain the use of te in intransitive sentences, as
in (222) below.(222)    na        n-amse          te       da-xe-nã
         1SG.POS   LNK-child       NOM      come-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘my children have come’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
Most probably, the case marker ke is historically related to the
homophonous marker ke that is used to mark focused subjects and
complements in nominal clauses, cf. section 4.4.

3.2 Pronouns3.2.1 Independent pronouns and emphatic pronouns:
      form
Drabbe 1957: section 11-12, p. 6a-7aThe forms of the free pronouns are as follows. Their function will be
discussed in detail below, but it is relevant to note here that the use of efe
and joxo is restricted to humans and animals, except when the former is
used as possessive pronoun in the construction described in 3.1.2.","[193, 194, 195]"
"3.7 Non-adjectival nominal markers3.7.1 The marker ta
Drabbe 1957: section 103o, p. 43aDrabbe refers to ta as a postposition, which is the term that he also uses for
what this book describes as postpositional case markers (see 3.6 above).
Although it is true that the marker is always used postnominally, its
function is different from that of the postpositional case markers described
above. While case markers mark the semantic or syntactic role of an
argument or adjunct with regard to the predicate, the marker ta has a
pragmatic function. It seems to mark the shift to or reactivation of the other
topic out of two entities (where the entity can also be a group), and can best
be rendered in English by the expression ‘in turn’. In addition to a sentence
from the text corpus (see (401) below), Drabbe gives the following two
examples:(399)    nu          mumu         kiomogo     wa       ki-ke                  na    n-axu

        ‘I got an eye infection first, and then my relatives got it in turn’ (Drabbe
        1957:43a)

          ‘I will eat from the bananas in turn too’ (Drabbe 1957:43a)
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                          253
In the text corpus, the marker has a very limited distribution, and is attested
almost exclusively185 in the following context:
[Efe                (n)      […]NP ]POSSESSIVE CONSTRUCTION      eke               ta

possessor                    possessed
In all cases the marker ta directly follows the emphatic 3SG pronoun eke
(once efe ke), and Drabbe writes explicitly that ta cannot follow the
possessive phrase directly.186 Note that also in (399) and (400) above we
find ta preceded by a pronoun plus ke. The sequence eke ta, in turn, follows
a possessive expression (again, this is also what we find in (399) and
(400)), in which the possessor corresponds to one out of two narrative
topics, and the possessor corresponds to the other one. In all contexts, the
two topics are relatives in a dyadic relation. The use of eke ta was
discussed extensively in 3.2.3.2, so that we can limit ourselves here to
giving some additional examples.","[270, 271]"

The story for all pronouns except 3SG, as presented by Drabbe, is rather
straightforward. Like nouns, discussed in 3.1.7, in verbal subject position
they may be accompanied by an optional nominative marker te, while as a
direct or indirect object they may combine with an accusative marker ke. In
nonverbal clauses, discussed in 4.2.1 and 4.4, they may combine with the
nominative case marker te or with the focus marker ke. As stated above,
182                             PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
however, Drabbe’s claims about free personal pronouns in other than 3rd
person can hardly be checked, due to lack of data. We now turn to the use
and distribution of the 3SG pronouns efe and eke, which deserve a more
elaborate discussion.
3.2.3.2 3rd person pronouns efe and eke
Drabbe 1957: section 12, p. 6b-7aThis section take the use of 3rd person pronouns as attested in the text
corpus as a starting point, and then returns to what Drabbe writes about
them. Although I will not go deeply into the definition of focus, I believe
that the overview of contexts in which eke and efe are used justifies my
analysis of eke as a contracted form of efe plus ke and as a focused form of
efe.","[199, 200]"

In the construction shown here, main stress is on the noun corresponding to
the possessed. We will first confine ourselves to cases where the NP
consists of a noun only. Cases where NP1 and NP2 are more complex will
be illustrated further below, when we come to the discussion of nested
possessive constructions.
which can be considered as a special type of exocentric compounds — for Yonggom
Wambon, Mandobo and Kombai. In the Aghu data available to us, no coordinate
compounds were attested.
112
      In certain cases, however, nominal compounds have been written without a hyphen (or
blank space) separating the parts. In those cases it has always been made clear, either in
the glossing or in additional explanation, that the word is a compound. An example is
mubigi [mu.bigi] ‘keel’ in 4.58, where the running text has mubigi, the first line of the
gloss has mu.bigi, the second line has ‘keel, and where a note is added that the word is
considered by Drabbe as a compound.

The quote above summarizes the main point: clauses headed by less
inflected verbs depend for their interpretation on the next fully inflected
verb to their right, but are at the same time not a constituent of the clause
containing the fully inflected verb. Following Foley (2010), these clauses
are probably better characterized as coordinate rather than subordinate.223223
      It is not so easy to prove, however, that the dependent clauses in Aghu are coordinate
rather than subordinate. According to Foley (2010), subordinate clauses are always
constituents of the main clause: either as a core argument, in which case they are
complement clauses; or as oblique arguments, in which case they are adverbial subordinate
clauses, or as modifier of a nominal constituent, in which case they are relative clauses.
One could state, therefore, that subordinate clauses, are ‘nominalized’, or — generally —
formally marked as noun phrases.
While in certain other Awyu-Dumut languages dependent clauses can be contrasted with
subordinate structures in which the clause is nominalized (cf. Wester 2014: 158 f.; de Vries
2005:372-377), this is not the case in Aghu; it is impossible to use language-internal
criteria to contrast the dependent clauses under discussion here with subordinate clauses.
Still, it makes more sense to consider them coordinate rather than subordinate. The main
reasons for this are the following: (1) There is simply no evidence that the clauses are
embedded in the following clause with fully inflected verb, and there is no evidence that
the clauses are nominalized (unless we follow Drabbe’s analysis of ke, see below); (2)
Drabbe never translates the dependent clauses in Aghu as complement clauses or relative
clauses, which — as stated by Foley 2010:32 — are typical functions of subordinate
clauses in Papuan languages. Although it is true that translations can never be taken as
evidence for the existence or non-existence of a certain grammatical construction, I
nevertheless believe that the total lack of relative and complement clauses in the Dutch
translation is telling; (3) although Drabbe refers to the nonfinite forms as deelwoorden

5.4 Aghu and switch referenceAs stated in the previous section, switch reference systems typically appear
in clause-chaining languages. As argued in de Vries (2010), who modifies a
theory set out in in Haiman and Munro (1983), clause chaining structures
are the result of coordination reduction in thematic continuity conditions,
where the basic principle is that those operators that are consistent over the
clauses are marked only on the verb of the final clause. De Vries shows
how, for Dumut languages, reduction took place in a diachronic process, in
cases where the operators of tense, mood and subject of a series of clauses
were continuous. In this process, verbs in SS conditions were the first to be
reduced and to become part of a chaining structure. Present Dumut
languages show the traces of this diachronic process: All Dumut languages
have dedicated nonfinite SS forms, which lack a specification for tense,
mood and person, while only some have dedicated DS forms. These DS
forms have grown from the non-reduced forms when used as non-final verb
in a series of clauses; as the use of reduced forms was restricted to SS
conditions, the non-reduced forms came to be associated with DS conditions.
In Dumut languages, then, we find (apart from the tensed forms which
(‘participles’), he places the words in apostrophes to show that they are different from
participles. The difference may very well be that participles are embedded while nonfinites
are not; (4) There are very clear cases where nonfinite clauses present foreground
information, e.g. in the durative constructions discussed in Durative aspect expressed by
constructions with posture verbs and at the end of 5.4.1.1. This is very unusual for
subordinate structures (cf. Dooley 2010). With regard to the first point, it should be noted
that the connective =k that is optionally used after nonfinites is considered by Drabbe the
same as the oblique marker ke used after nouns. Although it cannot be excluded that there
is a diachronic connection between the two particles, I believe that the two particles
synchronically have very different functions. The use of =k after nonfinite verbs cannot
be used, therefore, as an argument that the nonfinite clause would have been nominalized,
and that it would, therefore, be in a subordinate relation to the final clause.

largely function at discourse level, as in Aghu) reduced SS forms, and less
reduced semifinite verbs functioning in DS conditions.224
Coming back to Aghu, we find a somewhat paradoxical situation. On the
one hand, we find switch reference expressed in a way that is very much in
line with the patterns described above. We find a very frequent use of
reduced nonfinite forms in SS conditions, described in 5.4.1.1, while the less
reduced semifinite forms are used predominantly in DS conditions, as
described in 5.4.1.2. This system is very similar to the situation in South
Wambon, which de Vries characterizes as representing the first stage of a
development towards dedicated switch reference systems (de Vries
2010:345). On the other hand, switch reference can also be expressed by
the addition of suffixes to the less-reduced semifinite forms, a system that is
described in 5.4.2. Although this system is discussed by Drabbe rather
extensively, the text corpus contains very few examples of the use of the
respective affixes. The affixes express both switch reference and
sequentiality. The system is very different from the system discussed above,
because neither the SS nor the DS forms are reduced forms. On the contrary,
switch reference forms are more complex than ‘normal’ verbs, as they
result from the addition of suffixes.","[330, 331, 332]"
"As was stated in 3.1.7 and 3.6, there are good reasons to analyze te and ke
as case markers. Here I will defend this analysis, but show that they also
have a pragmatic function, which I tentatively describe as ‘focused’. I will
also explain why I analyze ke in certain contexts as a focus marker rather
than a case marker.
expected to take place. The use of ka or axajo puts in question whether the event has taken
place, is taking place or will take place. One might say that the use of de implies a high
degree of authority from the side of the speaker for the truth of the proposition, while polar
questions hand the authority for the truth of the proposition over to the addressee. Cf.
Timberlake (2007: 315f.).
215
      This is the only case where I have analyzed eke as an accusative; in all other cases it
has been analyzed as a 3SG pronoun plus focus, and glossed as 3SG.FOC; cf. 3.2.3.1.
300                             PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structureThe most convincing arguments in favor of ke and te as case markers are
the following. First, Drabbe gives some contrastive examples in which the
markers serve to disambiguate between the syntactic roles of subject and
object. A very convincing example, which was given in 3.1.5 and is
repeated here, is the following:(523)a   na         n-amse        t=       ed-oxe-nã
         1SG.POS    LNK-child     NOM      give-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘my children gave it’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)

         1SG.POS   LNK-child      ACC     give-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
Second, the case markers are in complementary distribution with other case
markers, discussed in 3.6.","[317, 318]"

           ‘She goes up and gives her younger sister some (of the) sago grubs, and they roast
           them and they eat.’ (1.054)
Drabbe writes that the normal order in clauses is subject, object, verb.
Expressions of time usually come in first position, while expressions of
place follow the subject. If we have two non-subject arguments, their
mutual order is free. According to Drabbe, the NP directly preceding the
verb receives more emphasis. Thus, in (450) below, it is emphasized that it
is ‘to my wife’ that the taro are given, more than what is given. Following
traditional terminology, Drabbe describes the recipient as the indirect object
and the gift as the direct object. We will follow Drabbe at this point.198198
      It should be noted that the terms subject, direct object and indirect object are generally
taken as indications of grammatical roles, which intermediate between semantic roles (like
Agent, Recipient) and pragmatic roles (like topic, focus, pragmatic pivot; cf. Andrews
2007). One should, therefore, have formal grammatical criteria to distinguish between
grammatical roles like direct object and indirect object, and not semantic criteria like
‘referring to a recipient’ versus ‘referring to the undergoer’. We have insufficient data,

In addition to order, the syntactic function of noun phrases (including
pronouns) may be indicated by case markers: the nominative marker te or
the accusative marker ke; That they should be analyzed as case markers is
further explained in 4.4. These markers are optional, and do not need to be
used when the function of the NP is clear from the context. Their precise
pragmatic function remains unclear. It is important to note, however, that
the use of te seems to be restricted to humans and larger animals: this is
stated explicitly by Drabbe for its use in non-verbal clauses, but might be
true for its use in verbal clauses too.199
however, to find these grammatical criteria. Moreover, many of these criteria, like
coreference relations in clause linking, can only be found out in fieldwork experiments, by
asking informants for grammaticality judgments etc. As this is not possible, it seems most
practical to follow Drabbe’s terminology, and use a loose semantic criterion to distinguish
between the two roles.
199
      Because Drabbe does not state this for verbal clauses, however, this is not more than an
assumption. The text corpus contains only two examples of nominative te (2.074 and
7.065), which happen to be cases of reference to humans.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure                                            277
A very good illustration of the optionality of case marking, taken from the
text corpus, is given in (452) below. In the first clause we find two overt
NP’s, neither of them marked for syntactic function (although eke ta has
exclusively been attested in subject position, cf. 3.2.3); apparently, their
function is clear from the context. In clause 2, we find only one overt NP,
in object function, not overtly marked as oblique. In clause 3 we again find
two overt NP’s, an indirect object: efe joxo ‘his brother’ and a direct object:
afitamã xabai ‘half a head’. In clause 4, finally, the non-subject role of efe
joxo is marked by the oblique marker ke, for unclear pragmatic reasons.","[293, 294, 295]"
"
In Aghu, there is a split in behavior between singular and 1PL experiencer-
arguments on the one hand, and N1 plural arguments on the other hand.
When the relevant argument belongs to the first category, the language uses
an ‘experiential construction’, which reflects the semantic nature of the
experiencer as being more closely associated with objects than with
subjects. The verb has (impersonal) 3SG inflection, while the argument is
optionally marked as accusative, by the use of the postpositional case
marker ke ‘ACC’. This is illustrated in (455) below. When the argument is
N1 plural, however, it behaves as a normal subject in a normal verbal
clause: the subject is optionally marked as nominative by the use of te,
while verbal inflection is N1PL, showing agreement with the subject. This is
illustrated in (456).",[298]
"
As stated above, nouns and noun phrases are generally not specified for
number. In line with Jakobson’s wording we may say that Aghu speakers
do not have to specify nouns and noun phrases for number. In these cases,
it is the linguistic or extralinguistic context which guides the interpretation.
Thus, in (190) and (191) it is knowledge of the world (that is: the
extralinguistic context) which makes that reference is made to a single
river, and to multiple fish traps.

In other contexts, it is not so much the extralinguistic but (also) the
linguistic context that guides the interpretation. In 3.1.5.2 below, we will
first consider cases where Noun Phrases are used as a subject, while 3.1.5.3
deals with cases where they have a different function in the clause. Before
we proceed on this, however, we first present a category of nouns with
dedicated plural forms.","[178, 179]"

Papuan languages to have personal or possessive pronouns that are tightly interwoven with
kinship terms was already noted by Drabbe (1950:101), and gives an anthropological
explanation: “in Awyu-Dumut languages, kinship terms express a dyadic relationship.
They do not refer to one person, as such, but to the relationship in which that person stands
to the speaker or another person (Stasch 2009:72). Awyu-Dumut kinship terms are not
inherently possessed, but it is rare for a kinship term to occur without the ‘possessor’ of
that particular kin being named” (Wester 2014: 56-57).
120
      From Drabbe’s description it is not clear whether contracted forms exist for all kinship
nouns, or only for a subset.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                               159
Examples of this dyadic construction are given in (186) through (188)
below:(186)       efe       n-eto             efe         n-amoko

            ‘younger and elder brother’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 3.001)
It is important to note that the dyadic construction can be used for dyadic
relations only, not for reference to pairs in a non-dyadic relation. In that
respect, it can be contrasted to the use of ko, as in (189) below, where the
phrase can refer either to a married couple (dyadic) or to a non-married
‘man and woman’:(189)       ãŋ           go        ku
            woman        and       man

Drabbe 1957: section 9, p. 5a-b; section 14, p. 7b-8aThe famous linguistic scholar Roman Jakobson once stated that ‘languages
differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may
convey’ (Jakobson 1959). Every linguistic system, in other words, has
grammaticalized other aspects of reality, and every linguistic system should,
therefore, be described in its own terms. In this section, I would like to
160                        PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
make clear that Aghu differs with respect to a language like English in what
it must say about number. This is also true for definiteness, which will be
the topic of 3.1.6 below. speakers of English must specify each Noun
Phrase for number and definiteness: Noun Phrases are either singular or
plural, and either definite or indefinite. This is not true for speakers of
Aghu. Noun Phrases are generally not specified for number, and there is no
requirement in Aghu grammar to specify Noun Phrases for definiteness. In
the words of Drabbe:“axu k’etede [human ACC see-1.RLS[SG] may mean: ‘I saw the man, a man, the men,
men.””121
Thus, while Aghu differs from English in what it must convey, speakers of
Aghu may choose to specify nouns for the categories expressed by number
and definiteness: they may choose to express whether a Noun Phrase refers
to single or multiple entities, and may choose to specify whether Noun
Phrases refer to entities known to the addressee or not. In the remainder of
this section we will consider number, while we will have a look at the
category of definiteness in section 3.1.6 below.","[176, 177, 178]"
"
Nevertheless, the case markers are somewhat atypical. First, they are
optional, so that the following sentence, minimally differing from (523)a
and b, is also grammatical.  c      na        n-amse               ed-oxe-nã
         1SG.POS   LNK-child            give-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘my children gave it / they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
Their optional nature raises the question about the precise motivation for
their use. One might hypothesize that they are used only when an NP’s
function is not clear from the context. This cannot explain, however, why it
is also possible to use these markers in case the verb has only one
argument, whose role can only be that of a subject, as in the following
example:
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure                                           301(524)      na         n-amse          te       da-xe-nã
           1SG.POS    LNK-child       NOM      come-N1.RLS-N1PL
           ‘my children have come’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
This example shows that the use of te cannot fully be explained from its
function as disambiguator between the syntactic roles of subject and object;
it must also have a pragmatic function. As our data are too limited — we
especially lack minimally contrastive examples and descriptions of their
meaning differences — we have to remain ignorant about the nature of this
pragmatic function. In verbal clauses, therefore, we analyze te and ke as
case markers, the use of which is also guided by pragmatic factors that
remain to be investigated.216
In nonverbal clauses, the use of te and ke again is optional, except in
clauses with meoxo ‘who’ as a subject, where it is obligatory.217 As was
shown in 4.2, both te and ke may be used either in subject position or as
marker of the copula complement. Te is consistently analyzed as a
nominative marker. Ke, however, is analyzed as a a focus marker. This
shown in the following table:Table 54: Analysis of ke and te in nonverbal clauses

Considering ke in subject position, my main argument to analyze it as a
focus marker is of a negative nature, in that it is hard to think of ke as an
accusative marker:
216
      An interesting example of the use of ke is found in 3.024, which was cited in 4.1 above,
example (452).","[318, 319]"

           ‘that one over there is my father’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)
Turning to the use of ke with a complement, its analysis as a focus marker
again makes more sense than the analysis as a case marker. This is mainly
because in non-verbal clauses we cannot find a grammatical opposition
between the use of ke and the use of te as we found in verbal clauses.
Examples of the use of ke marking a complement are found in (464)-(467)
above, the last of which has been copied here as (526).218(526)      Wi       ke         de

           ‘it’s a pig’ (Drabbe 1957:8b)
The analysis of ke as a focus marker is supported by other contexts where
ke is best analyzed as such. We also find ke in the subject position of
verbal clauses, always in combination with a free pronoun, and often
followed by ta. This was discussed extensively in Chapter 3; the use of eke,
a cliticized form efe ‘3SG’ plus ke ‘FOC’, was discussed in 3.2.3.2, while the
use of ke ‘FOC’ in combination with other pronouns came along in the

      Dixon (2010b:159 f.) refers to copula as copula verbs and to the predicate as the copula
complement. He writes that cross-linguistically copula complements are often not case-
marked at all. He also points out, however, that we find other possibilities, like some
Eastern European languages where copula complements can be marked either with
nominative, or with oblique case, dependent on the nature of the relation: permanent or
temporary (ibid: 170). From a functional point of view, it is not so surprising that a copula
complement can be marked either way: it has the same referent as the subject-topic, but
generally refers to an object that is affected, which is typical for objects. In Aghu we find
all three possibilities: no marking, marking with a a nominative marker te (which usually
marks subjects), and marking with a focus marker ke, possibly historically related to an
accusative marker ke (which usually marks objects).

presented in Chapter 3 as (233) and (400), respectively, illustrate this use.","[319, 320, 321]"
"4.2 Nonverbal clauses and clauses formed with
    ki(k) become
Drabbe 1957: sections 15-17, p. 8-9Just as in verbal clauses, the predicate in nonverbal clauses is always
clause-final. The general clause structure could be described as subject
followed by predicate, where the subject is not necessarily overt, and — if
overt — consists of a noun phrase or a free pronoun. Predicates consist of a
noun phrase, adjectival phrase or numeral phrase, followed by a copula de
or oxo, the latter of which is used only in the formation of adjectival and
numeral predicates. Subjects are optionally cliticized either with a focus
marker ke or a nominative marker te, with the latter marker being restricted
to humans and larger animals. In nominal predicates formed with de, the
predicator noun can be marked by the case markers te ‘NOM’ or by the
focus marker ke ‘FOC’, with the same restriction that te is restricted to
larger animals and humans (see 4.4 for the analysis of ke as a focus marker
in this context). The rest of this section will consider the different types of
predicates one by one. Before we continue, however, it should be noted that
the nonverbal clauses under discussion here may only have a past or a
present interpretation. For reference to future one has to use a clause
formed with a semifinite or finite irrealis form of ki(k) ‘become’, discussed
in 4.2.6, or to use a copulative posture verb, as discussed in 2.8.2.",[301]
"
An overview of spatial nouns is given below. The translations here have
been chosen to make clear that we have to do with nouns, not with adverbs
or adpositions.womu ‘space inside’, used e.g. for inside of a house
fü ‘space below’, used e.g. for place below a house, a mat etc.
gesi ‘space close by’
mo ‘backside’, e.g. back of a person, underside of a dish
betaxa ‘space outside’
mübã ‘back (of a person)’, ‘bottom’
sama ‘front’, e.g. front of a person, upper part of dish
todo ‘space upside’
musuto ‘space on top’
baga ‘ridge’ ‘space alongside’, e.g. idi / widi/ büsiü baga: ‘along the road /
river / house’
236                             PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesThat these words are nouns is clear from their distribution. Consider the
following three examples:(362)      kesaxe     gesi          ige
           tree       space.close   lie-N1.RLS[SG]
           ‘it is (lying) close to the tree’ (Drabbe 1957:41b)
(363)      kesaxe     gesi          kèmu~kem=(/kumu)172         ige
           tree       space.close   ACC                          lie-N1.RLS[SG]
           ‘it is (lying) close to the tree’ (Drabbe 1957:41b)
Taking into consideration that kèmu is a postpositional case marker (see
3.1.7 and 3.6.2), and thus follows a noun phrase, we must analyze kesaxe
gesi as a noun phrase. This means that gesi cannot be a postposition or
postpositional case marker. An analysis as adverb is very unlikely too, as
gesi does not modify the verb, but the tree: reference is made to a space
close to the tree, rather than to one lying close by. I follow Drabbe,
therefore, in analyzing gesi — and the other morphemes listed above — as
nouns, which form a possessive construction with the preceding noun. This
means that the sentences would translate literally as ‘it is lying in the tree’s
closeness’. That the morphemes are not postpositions is confirmed by the
fact that they can also be used independently, as in (364) below.(364)      gesi          i-ge
           space.close   lie-N1.RLS[SG]
           ‘it is lying close’173,174 (Drabbe 1957:41b)
172
      For the use of kumu see 3.6.2.
173
      It must be admitted that here the semantic argument that was used above as evidence
that gesi is not an adverb at first sight does not seem to hold. Here reference is made to a
lying close, which could possibly be taken as being a modification of the verb. I believe,
however, that an analysis of gesi as a noun is still to be preferred. First and most
importantly, gesi is used in a position in which one can also use nouns. If we consider gesi
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                        237Below we find another series of illustrations of the use of spatial nouns,
which have all been taken from the text corpus. Again, while some of these
seem to be developing into adverbs, or seem to be used adverbially, they
are generally used in positions where one also finds other nouns. In (365),
we find mo as indicating the location of the predicate baxe ‘he sits’:(365)     Efe     sẽ           mo          baxe,
          efe     sẽ           mo          ba-xe
          3SG     husband      backside    sit-N1.RLS[SG]
          efe     nagã         mügünük                  baxe.
          efe     n-agã        mügü-nü=k                ba-xe
          3SG     LNK-wife     be.in.front-SS=CON       sit-N1.RLS[SG]
          ‘The husband sits in the back, the wife sits in the front.’ (4.69)
In the example below, womu ‘inside’ is used in a possessive construction
with axafĩ ‘women’s house’, referring to the house’s inside. Since the
grammatical role of object, in our definition, includes the semantic role of
as a noun also here, we have a more economic analysis than if we consider it an adverb, as
this would lead to an extra set of adverbs. Second, one could think of gesi etc. as
expressing a place close to another point in space, rather than as a modification of the
predicate. In cases like (362) and (363), the point in space is provided by the noun. In a
case like (364), it is provided by the deictic center, which defines as the perspective from
where the narrative is described, cf. 3.2.4.
174
      Even stronger evidence in favor of their analysis as nouns would be provided by
examples where the forms are used as subject (as in English ‘the inside was clean’), or in
other positions where they could not in any way be analyzed as adverbs, e.g. in a role of
patient or instrument, (e.g. ‘I saw the backside’). Unfortunately, no such examples are
provided by Drabbe. Also missing are examples where we find independent forms
followed by nominative te or accusative ke.

predicate dadek ekenã ‘they stand listening’.176(367)     Dadek               betaxa        dadek             ekenã.

Finally consider the following cases of spatial nouns used in combination
with the verb mi ‘come down’. Example (368) forms the continuation of
(366) above. It is part of a passage where a boy shoots a person, cuts off his
head, and flies back with the head to the ridge of the women’s house. From
there he casts the head into the house, (366), and — seen from within the
house — comes down behind this stone, or ‘at the back of this stone’.","[253, 254, 255, 256]"

Figure 19: parts of the Aghu-English wordlist
As can be seen in the figure above, references to the text corpus, sections in
this publication or sections in Drabbe are printed in the position following
the English translation (e.g. 1.135 etc. at a(x)). Numbers in non-bold font
refer to sections in the text corpus or in the grammatical introduction,
dependent on the structure of the code. References to the English-Aghu
wordlist, on the other hand, are given in bold font. The absence of numbers
in non-bold font means that the morpheme in question was attested in the
wordlist only. This is the case, for example, for adena above, which only
has a reference to the wordlist, in bold font: 029. Likewise, absence of a
introduction uses small caps to grammatical functions, the wordlist and texts use ‘normal’
capitals.

reference to the wordlist means that the item was not attested in this list,
but only in one or more of the other sources. See, for example, abi or
abibiamV. Coming back to the references in non-bold, the following
method was followed. If an item was attested in the text corpus, I have
always added at least one reference to a place of occurence. In addition, I
have added references to sections in Drabbe or in this publication, only in
those cases where the form was not attested in the text corpus, or in cases
where these extra references were considered useful for the reader.","[406, 407]"
"189
      In fact, I get the strong impression that in most of the cases attested in the text corpus,
the function of the ‘quantifier’ is not to quantify or modify the noun. It seems rather the
case that the first noun presents the sentire set, after which the quantifier specifies a subset.
Thus, in many cases the rendering of the logical structure of the expression should be
something like ‘some of N’ or ‘all of N’, rather than ‘some N’ or ‘all N’.

Aghu has no word for ‘few’ that can be combined with count nouns.
Instead, one uses negated forms of words denoting ‘many’. In combination
with mass nouns, however, one may use patoxo. The word means ‘small’ in
combination with count nouns, and is used in combination with mass nouns
in order to denote a small quantity.","[278, 279]"
"
Coming to the distribution of verbal nouns, their distribution comes close to
that of nouns:
           a. they can be argument (subject or object) of a predicate;
           b. they can be predicated over by means of the predicator de;
           c. they can be marked for (dative) case;
           d. they can take the position of the possessed noun in a
                 possessive construction; vowel initial verbs in this position
                 combine with the possessive linker n-
They differ from nouns, however, in that they can also be predicated over
by oxo, a predicator that is otherwise never used for nouns, but only for the
predication of adjectives and numerals (cf. section 4.2.2 and 4.2.3). The
remainder of this section will first discuss and illustrate the different
distributional properties of verbal nouns mentioned above, and then give
some additional contexts in which they are used. We will begin, therefore,
with contexts in which the verbal nouns clearly take a position usually
reserved for nouns.

Drabbe 1957: section 31, 32, p. 15aAn example where the verbal noun functions as argument of a predicate is
the following. Note that this example not only illustrates point (a) above,
but also point (d): the verbal noun is used as part of a possessive
construction and takes the possessive linker n-.(21)    ga           n-oŋgã            jafi            oxo

        ‘your carved work is beautiful’ (Drabbe 1957:15a)
While in (21) the verbal noun takes subject position, Drabbe also gives
examples where the verbal noun is used as a complement (for the use of
ki(k) as a copula instead of oxo, which is a common alternation, cf. section
4.2.6). Two of those examples are given in (22) and (23).(22)   efe          te      büsiü     asin             oman       oxo

the noun idi as object.(24)    (...) idi        omaŋ        gike.

Drabbe also gives examples, however, of verbal nouns predicated over by
means of oxo. This is a property of verbal nouns in which they differ from
other nouns, which can only be predicated over by de (cf. section 4.2.1).
The example below illustrates predication with oxo:(26)   ga         n-ongan              oxo

vowel-initial words confirms that we have a possessive construction (cf.

"
In (250) below, the demonstrative pronoun takes the position of the
possessor, which is an illustration of number 4 in the list above. The use of
the possessive linker shows that we have to do here with a possessive
construction (cf. 3.1.2).(250)      xo-to              n-axu              fe    dateke   küŋ-ge

Drabbe writes that in cases where the demonstrative is used independently,
it often functions as a personal pronoun. He gives three examples with the
demonstrative xo, which are all instances of number 3 in the list above.
Note that the demonstratives are translated here as personal pronouns.(251)       xo          te      o-xe

146
      Drabbe gives a somewhat different example: xo k=üfü-oxe that ACC=hit-N1.RLS[SG]
and mistakenly translates this as ‘I have hit him’, instead of ‘he has hit him’.

A final example is the following, where we do not find a spatial noun.
While the object of tĩ usually refers to an entire animal that is (deadly)

wounded (cf. 1.158, 1.211, 1.217 etc.), here it is only one body part that is

In the text corpus, kumu ‘ACC’ is attested only three times, in 3.184, 6.078
and 8.008. While the second is analogous to (396) above (describing the
shooting of an arm), in the other two cases kumu can be said to modify a
spatial noun. One of these cases is presented here:(397)       Emu       to             kumu        pemoxo

need to be marked by ke, ni or fini, usually in their cliticized form. From
Drabbe’s description it is not clear whether there’s a meaning difference
between the three:(398)   nu         k=/n=/fin=                 i-oxe

Although ni usually may combine either with efe or with eke, in this
construction only eke is acceptable.","[268, 269, 270]"
"
To conclude, it should be noted that the word order as described by Drabbe
is not without exception. The text corpus does contain a number of
examples where the object precedes the subject. One of these cases is
presented below. Although the number of examples is too small to draw
any rigid conclusions on factors influencing word order, it is not unlikely
that in a case like (453) the initial position of the indirect object has to do
with its topicality. The sentence is about the two boys who have received
food (from a parrot), even though the two are not framed here as a subject
(which is the grammatical role that usually coincides with the pragmatic
role of topic (cf. footnote 202)).",[296]
"
    (1) The narrator usually chooses a perspective that does not coincide
         with the position of one of the participants. Even in case one of the
         participants is in the house, still the DC often is at the bottom of the
         tree house, e.g. in 3.008, where one of the two boys is waiting inside
         the house, while the other goes up (not: ‘comes up’).
    (2) In certain exceptional cases, the DC coincides with the DC of one of
         the participants. This is the case, for example, in 1.031, where we
         have a very brief interruption of the main DC. Here we see the
356                PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations
      description of a mouse coming into the house where the main
      participants are located.
  (3) The description of movement is generally not dependent on the
      place from where the story is told, although it is possible to take this
      as a DC, as is the case in the final section of the narrative discussed
      above.
  (4) An investigation of the shifts of DC over a story might very well
      offer a fruitful insight into the way in which Aghu narratives are
      structured. At least in the narratives presented here, the story line is
      structured around repetitive movements from and to a rather limited
      number of DC’s. It would be interesting to investigate to what
      extent this narrative technique is comparable to techniques found in
      other languages. More insight in the spread of this kind of technique
      would be a good starting point for its explanation. The more local
      the pattern, the more likely it is indicative of contact. The more
      universal, the more it asks for a universally valid explanation (e.g. in
      terms of mnemonic techniques).

3.1.3 Possessive constructions with nisi
Drabbe 1957: section 16, p. 9a; section 23, p. 11aDrabbe describes the meaning of nisi as ‘owner’. In its semantic structure, a
construction with nisi is similar to a compound of type 1 in that the
modifying part precedes the head. It is different from this type of
compounds, however, in that the modifier can also be an entire clause.
While an example like (177) below shows that the modifier may be a noun,
in most of the examples provided by Drabbe and in all the examples
attested in the text corpus, the modifier is a clause.(177)       büsiü     nisi         bo-de116
            house     owner        sit-1.RLS[SG]
            ‘I am the owner of the house’ (Drabbe 1957:11b)
In case nisi is preceded directly by a verb, it causes word stress to shift
from the ultimate to the penultimate syllable of the word, see e.g. sìke in
(179) below. Example (178) represents a case where the position of the
possessed is filled by a nonverbal clause. In all other examples that follow,
the position is filled by verbal clauses.",[172]
"
162
      The hypothesis that we have to do with grammaticalized forms which are no longer in a
productive relation to the shorter form is reinforced by the fact that the longer forms are no
longer fully predictable from the shorter forms, e.g. botu corresponds to boteaxa not
*botuaxa, and bodü corresponds to bodixa not *bodüaxa. We find the same axV and oxo in
the question words meoxo ‘who’ and makeaxe ‘what’, discussed in 3.2.5.1.

1. Drabbe makes a distinction between adverbs that modify adjectives and adverbs that
modify verbs. That certain adverbs may also serve to modify an other adverb, a clause /
sentence or another noun, has been added by Wilco van den Heuvel, on the basis of the
data attested in the corpus. The adverbs da, tafeaxa and xati are not mentioned by Drabbe
in his discussion of adverbs. 2. Drabbe is not consistent in rendering stress for this word,
which may indicate that it alternates. In this book, the form is consistently rendered as
isiomu, except when citing examples provided by Drabbe. 3. Xati seems to indicate the
repetition of an earlier event. It is also used in cases where the same event is performed on
a different object, e.g. in 2.094, where first some moldered wood is brought up, and now
(again / also) a stick. In such cases, we would use 'also' in English, instead of 'again'. This
might be seen as an indication that xati (in these cases) modifies the verb (only the
bringing up is modified), and not the entire clause (which includes the object).

3.4.1 Modifiers of adjectives
Drabbe 1957: section 75, p. 30a-bAs intensifiers of adjectives we find xajã ‘really’, püsiü ‘very’ or püsiüaxa
‘very’ and isiomu ‘very/all’, all of which Drabbe proposes to gloss as
‘very’. In all the examples provided by Drabbe, the adjectives are used
predicatively. Xajã ‘very’ and püsiü ‘very’ are also attested as adjectives:
xajã ‘real’ and püsiü ‘big’. Isiomu is placed before the adjective that it
modifies, while the other forms follow the adjective. As can be seen in
(307), the pre-adjectival and post-adjectival adverbs can also be combined.(306)       jafi            xajã /           jafi           püsiü /        isiom=       jafi
            beautiful       very             beautiful      very           very / all   beautiful
            ‘very beautiful’ (Drabbe 1957:30a)
(307)       Eŋge                    isiom’          jafi           püsiü   oxo.
            ẽ-ge                    isiom=          jafi           püsiü   oxo

            ‘She eats and it is very good.’ (6.225)
Isiom= has a wider distribution than the other intensifiers, and can also be
used to modify a verb (or another adverb).163 In order to catch all these
adverbial uses, I have chosen to consistently gloss it as ‘very/all’.(308)       isiòmu        da-xe-nã
            very/all      come-N1.RLS-N1PL
            ‘they all came’ (Drabbe 1957:29b)
(309)      nu        isiom=          üfü-oxe
           1SG       very/all        hit-N1.RLS[SG]
           ‘he hit me very hard’ (Drabbe 1957:30a)163
      Drabbe writes that isiomu can also be used in combination with adverbs, but does not
give an example.
214                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes(310)   isiom=      tadixa      ke        de
        very/all    big         FOC       COP
        ‘it is very big’ (Drabbe 1957:29b)
(311)   isiom=       kisièmu    küŋ-ge
        very/all     real        die-N1.RLS[SG]
        ‘he really really died’ (Drabbe 1957:30a)
One could also argue that in cases like (308) isiomu is not so much
modifying the verb, but rather the covert subject of the verb. This could be
taken as an argument to analyze the forms in cases like these as indefinite
numerals (modifying the covert subject) rather than as adverbs. In this
context it is relevant to compare (308) above to (312) below. In both cases,
the gloss is a literal translation of the gloss given by Drabbe, where the
gloss in (312) shows that Drabbe sees the form as an indefinite numeral.
This is in line with Drabbe’s earlier section on numerals, where he
describes isiomu as an indefinite numeral, used — like other numerals — in
postnominal position. Although Drabbe may very well be right, I believe
that — given the analogy to (308) — it is still possible to analyze isiomu as
an adverb. This is expressed by the second gloss.(312)    axu       isiom=       da-xe-nã
         human     very/all     come-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘all people came’ (Drabbe 1957:29b) / ‘the people all came’ (my alternative
         interpretation)
We find something of the same ambiguity between an analysis as an adverb
or as indefinite numeral in the two following examples, which are part of
one and the same narrative. As Drabbe does not give a sentence-by
sentence translation in his textual corpus, the translations are more guided
by my own interpretation than in (308) and (312) above. The sentences are
part of a passage where a younger brother is located in a house. His older
brother comes flying to this house, and bumps into it when trying to get in.

In (313) it is worded how, because of this, his head gets crushed entirely.
Here, the position of isiom= does not allow for an analysis as an indefinite
numeral, as it is not in a postnominal position.","[229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"

generally linked asyndetically. This means that the use of conjunctions to
connect clauses is rare. Whether this is also true for noun phrases is hard to
say, as the text corpus does not contain examples of conjoined noun
phrases, neither asyndetically, nor syndetically. In Drabbe’s description,
however, we find a presentation of both NP conjoining and clause
conjoining conjunctions. These are presented in 3.8.1 and 3.8.2,
respectively.","[272, 273]"

If we exclude the use of efe in possessive constructions, we are left with
only four attestations of efe in the entire corpus. In only one case, the
pronoun efe is followed by te, which is the nominative marker that is also
optionally used after other pronouns or nouns in subject position (see
above). The sentence is part of narrative 2; father and mother have just put
their penis gourd and their skirt in a water quiver. They tell the children to
watch these objects; if they start to perish, then they know that Apupüsimo
has killed them:(230)       Boasĩ,                  Apupüsimo     efe     te       nügu      xomüge.

            ‘(If) they wear down, then (you know that) Apupüsimo he has killed us.’ (2.074)
The sentence above is the only example in the entire corpus where we find
efe combined with te. In all other cases, three in total, we find efe preceded
by a NP and followed by ke ta FOC IN.TURN. The context of use of efe ke ta
is identical to that of the far more frequent eke ta, which will be discussed
below.140
Turning to the use of eke, its distribution as attested in the text corpus can
be summarized as follows:
140
      We will come back to the use of NP efe ke ta in note 141 below.
184                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
    (1) It is attested in subject function only, despite of the fact that Drabbe
         describes eke as a 3SG “oblique” form (which roughly corresponds
         to what I call an accusative marker; see Drabbe’s note to 6.155).
      (2) In 20 out of a total of 24 attestations, eke is preceded by a subject
         NP (once consisting of a free pronoun only) and followed by ta
         ‘IN.TURN’.
      (3) In the other 3 cases, eke is neither preceded by a subject NP nor
         followed by ta
We will first consider those cases where eke is combined with a subject NP
and ta. The contexts where this construction is used can be clearly defined.
The construction is attested in three different texts, all of which narrate
about persons in a dyadic relationship: a younger and an elder brother in
texts 3 and 6, and a younger and an elder sister in text 1. In all contexts of
use, we first find narrated how one of the two persons participates as
‘subject’ (corresponding to syntactic S or A) in a certain event. Then we
find the sentence where eke ta is used, which always expresses that the
other person of the dyadic relation has, in turn, participated as subject
(again, corresponding to S or A) in a similar event. Consider (231) through
(233) below. In the preceding sentences, it has been narrated how the
younger and the elder brother both leave the house to go hunting and
fishing, respectively. The younger brother shoots a cassowary, and brings it
home. The following sentences narrate how the younger brother comes
first, or ‘participates as subject in the event of coming’ and waits for his
brother. Sentence (233) then tells how the elder brother comes up too, or
‘participates as a subject in a similar event of coming’.","[200, 201, 202]"
"
Conclusively, we can state that efe and eke differ in their distribution. Efe
is used mainly to refer to the possessor in a possessive construction. In
addition, it is attested only four times in subject position: once followed by
the nominative marker te, and three times followed by ke ta FOC IN.TURN, in
which case the expression seems equivalent to eke ta. Eke, on the other
hand, is used in combination with ta IN.TURN in the majority of cases, and
attested in the text corpus exclusively in subject position. Also in cases
without ta we have to do with events where one out of two topical
participants is reintroduced, reactivated, or contrasted with the other one,
which is the reason why I have glossed eke as a focused form of efe.",[207]
"
It is clear that the data is far too scarce to make any reliable claims about
the meaning of the future, or to deviate from Drabbe’s interpretation. I do
believe, however, that future investigation of the future should bear the
following factors in mind:
(1) The use of a ‘future’ suffix -e is not needed for a future interpretation;
the bare semifinite irrealis already implies a future reading
80                                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs(2) It might very well be that suffixation with -e is used to express a certain
degree of certainty or assurance from the part of the speaker, rather than a
future tense. In this respect it is important to note that the ‘future’ suffix -e
follows the person-number markers, unlike the tense affixes -k and -dia,
which precede the suffix. This might be seen as iconically reflecting the
fact that evaluative modal operators operate at a higher level (the level of
the entire proposition) than the more objective operators of tense (which, to
follow Dik’s terminology, operate at the level of the State of Affairs, cf.
Dik 1997: 236-243, 295-296). 62
2.3.3.3 Summary about tense
Summarizing, tense is a very marginal category in Aghu, and the attested
cases of fully finite forms are few. It is clear that tense hardly plays a role
within the narratives available to us. Of the distant past forms the text
corpus contains only a handful of cases, in constructions where the
temporal meaning is bleached. Historical past forms are attested only in the
concluding sections of the narratives, and might possibly be thought of as a
means to place the stories in a mythical past. Future forms, finally, are very
rare too, largely due to the narrative genre with only little direct speech.
More investigation, especially of texts from other genres, would be needed
in order to get a better grasp of the Aghu tense system, and to see whether
its classification as a category of tense does indeed most justice to its
function.","[97, 98]"

Drabbe discusses various ways in which pronouns can be modified, many
of which, however, are not attested in the text corpus.137 What needs to be136
      According to Drabbe, the basic form of the 3SG pronoun is efe, while eke is analyzed as
a contracted form of efe + ke. Wester (2014:71) gives both efe and eke as Aghu 3SG
pronouns, and derives the latter form from pA *eke. She also writes that the form efe (or
ewe in Shiaxa and Yenimu) “could well have originated in an Awyu-Dumut deictic
element ep or e ‘there’.” Irrespective of the question whether these reconstructions are
correct, it is clear that efe and eke synchronically have different functions. More on this
can be found in 3.2.3.2.
137
      Drabbe (1957:7a) mentions the following. (1) ku ‘EMP’ (discussed in the text above) can
be followed by gedeme, which further emphasizes the concept of ‘self’: nu ku gedeme
‘1SG-EMP EMP’. (2) Emphatic pronouns can also be followed by a pronoun of same person
plus namu, which has the same meaning as the construction with gedeme: nu-ku nu-namu
‘1SG-EMP 1SG-EMP’. (3) Instead of emphatic oku following the pronoun, speakers may also
use okagi or okagimu. (4) Drabbe points to the use of emphatic pronouns in certain
nominal clauses: ok’ iman e-ke [3SG.EMP EMP stand-N1.RLS[SG]] or ok’ iman ba-xe [EMP
EMP sit-N1.RLS[SG]] ‘that’s how he is’. In these examples, the posture verbs e ‘stand’ and
178                          PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
mentioned here, however, is the use of the emphatic suffix -ku ‘EMP’, which
may follow the 1SG, 2SG or 3PL pronouns. In 3SG the form oku is used,
which Drabbe tentatively analyzes as a contracted form of efe and ku.138
The forms of 1SG and 2SG plus -ku are also used for reference to plural
speakers and addressees, so that we get the following paradigm:Table 42: Emphatic pronouns
          SG        PL
1         nuku
2         guku
3         oku       joxokuThe emphatic pronouns from Table 42 alternate with oku followed by the
independent pronouns of Table 41. In other words, oku nu ‘EMP 1SG’ has
the same distribution and meaning as nu-ku ‘1SG-EMP’; oku gu ‘EMP 2SG’ is
identical in meaning and distribution to gu-ku ‘2SG-EMP’, and ok’ eke
alternates with oku. The form oku therefore seems to show traces of a
diachronic development from ‘3SG-EMP’ to a grammatical formative
unspecified for person, to be glossed as ‘EMP’.139 In this book, the form is
glossed either as 3SG-EMP or as EMP, dependent on its position.ba ‘sit’ function as a copulas, cf. 2.8.2. (5) In possessive phrases we find nu namu na büsiü
[1SG only 1SG.POS house ] ‘my own house, a house belonging to me only’; eke namu efe
büsiü [3SG.FOC only 3SG house ] ‘his own house’, or oku ga büsiü ke de [EMP 2SG.POS
house FOC COP ] ‘it is your own house’.
138
      I have used the term ‘tentatively’ here to make clear that Drabbe notes the ambiguity
between 3SG reading of oku, and one in which it is used to strengthen other than 3 rd person
pronouns; see the discussion below.
139
      Alternatively, one might hypothesize that * oku is the basic form, which, in a position
after pronouns — which are all vowel-final — developed into a suffix -ku. In third person
singular, the form oku might either be suppletive for the 3SG pronoun + oku, or be the
result of a contraction between *oku and a 3SG proto pronoun (which has now become
lost).

In combination with the word nikiaxamu ‘back’, the emphatic pronoun gets
a reflexive reading, as in the following example:(223)     oku            nikiaxamu   mü ̃           kõ       ku-nu-k      küŋ-ge
          3SG.EMP        back        oblique         neck     put-SS-CON   kill-N1.RLS[SG]
          ‘he put his neck through the rope and killed himself’ (Drabbe 1957:7a)
(224)     nu       ku        nikiaxamu       ügeme-de
          1SG      EMP       back            chop-1.RLS[SG]
          ‘I wounded myself while chopping’ (Drabbe 1957:7a)3.2.2 Possessive pronouns: form
Drabbe 1957: section 13, p. 7a/bThe language has dedicated possessive pronouns for 1SG and 2SG only: na
and ga, respectively. In all other cases, the ‘normal’ independent pronouns
of Table 41 above are used. Possessive constructions formed with pronouns
are parallel in structure to the possessive constructions described in Figure
10 above: possessive pronouns directly precede the nouns they modify. This
is indicated in Figure 14:(possessive) pronoun                     N2

180                      PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
Here too vowel-initial nouns combine with a possessive linker n=.
Interestingly, it is only before these vowel-initial nouns that the possessive
pronouns na and ga alternate with the free pronouns nu and gu.(225a)   na            n-amu                        / (b)    nu          n-amu
         1SG.POS       LNK-meat                              1SG         LNK-meat
         ‘my meat’ (Drabbe 1957:7a)                          ‘my meat’ (Drabbe 1957:7a)
(226a)   ga         n-eto                           / (b)    gu                     n-eto
         2SG.POS    LNK-father                               2SG                    LNK-father
         ‘your father’ (Drabbe 1957:7b)                      ‘your father’ (Drabbe 1957:7b)
With consonant-initial nouns, however, only the possessive pronouns can be
used, so that (227a) is ungrammatical:(227a)   na                      xasi     /   (b)      *nu        xasi
         1SG.POS                 spear                 1SG        spear
         ‘my spear’ (Drabbe 1957:7a)                   ‘my spear’ (concluded from Drabbe
                                                       1957:7a)
Nouns referring to kinship may, in 1SG and 2SG, take possessive prefixes.
These were described in 3.1.4 above.","[195, 196, 197, 198]"
"
204
      In this case Drabbe only gives examples where ke is included. From his description and
from other examples that he gives, however, we may safely conclude that ke can be elided.
205
      In this case Drabbe only gives examples where te is included. From his description and
from other examples that he gives, however, we may safely conclude that te can be elided.

Note that most of the verbs listed above have, in addition to the
experiencer, an additional argument that may seem to function as a subject.
In this respect, it is interesting to compare the following pairs:(457) a   nu     ke         kinoxo       mi-ke
          1SG    ACC        tear         come.down-N1.RLS[SG]
          ‘I got tears in my eyes’ (Drabbe 1957:24a)

          3PL    NOM        tear     come.down-N1.RLS-N1PL
          ‘They go tears in their eyes (Drabbe 1957:24a)
It is very well possible to think of kinoxo in (457) a as the subject. Its status
in the b- example, however, is harder to define. If we consider joxo te as
the subject — which is what I would propose, given its marking as
nominative and the agreement with the verb — what then is the status of
kinoxo? I will leave this question for further research.","[299, 300]"
"
First, the majority of head clauses that pick up the tail clause of the
preceding clause chain or sentence are nonfinite SS forms, chained to the
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations                                        343
following clause.253 Examples are akusunuk in (591), kunuk in (595) and
günd in (596). This pattern is in line with the observation by de Vries that
“the default form of the recapitulated head clause follows from the default
or unmarked form of clause linkage in that language” (de Vries 2005:372;
2006:817). Another technique is to repeat the final verb of the tail literally,
something we see in the case of güŋge in (594). Third, it can be seen that
tail-head linkage is an optional and ‘creative’ process. In (592) we see that
the sequence of sentences that is linked by tail-head linkage is interrupted
by the semifinite verb akusuŋge, a form that was also used as the final verb
of (590). Following this, the verb onok in (593) picks up the tail of (591),
after which we find a further sequence of tail-head linked sentences. Not
illustrated here but attested elsewhere in the text corpus are cases where
also the object noun of a preceding sentence is repeated, or cases where the
last two clauses are repeated. 254 These phenomena show that tail-head
linkage should be seen as a discourse strategy or discourse preference,
rather than as part of sentence grammar (de Vries 2005:364).","[360, 361]"

Drabbe 1957: sections 102-103, p. 41-43In analyzing Aghu postpositions as case markers, this book follows Dixon’s
terminology, who writes that “case systems are used to mark the function
of a core argument (S, A, or O) and /or to mark spatial, temporal, and other
relations on peripheral arguments” (Dixon 2010:224).177 The table below
gives an overview of the postpositional case markers attested in Aghu,
accompanied by a gloss and a brief explanation of their function.","[257, 258]"

3.2.3.3 Recapitulation: pronouns, animacy and possession
Drabbe 1957: section 13, p. 7a-bAs was noted briefly in 3.2.1, the pronouns efe 3SG and joxo 3PL can only
be used as free pronouns when referring to human beings or to animals. As
part of a possessive construction of the form described in 3.1.2, however,
efe can also be used in combination with other nouns. Drabbe gives the
following examples:(240)     kito      efe      womu
          foot      3SG      middle
          ‘the middle toe / thirteen’ (Drabbe 1957: 7b)

          house       3SG          opening

190                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesInstead of efe, one may also use one of the pronouns wofe(ne) or xofe(ne),
which are formed from wo ‘THAT’ and xo ‘DIST’ plus fe, but which I have
glossed simply as 3SG forms. The only example of these forms given by
Drabbe is the following, where we find the vowel e assimilated to the i of
the following noun. Assimilation to a following i is also not uncommon for
efe, as can be seen in example b.(242a)   xofini    fi                   b)   ifi    fi

expressions of space, I will make use of the term deictic center (DC) to
refer to the ‘point in space’ from where a situation is viewed. This section
will first focus on the form of demonstrative pronouns, and then go deeper
into their meaning and distribution.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                               1913.2.4.1 Form
Drabbe 1957: section 61, p. 24a,bAghu has three basic demonstrative pronouns. These can be used both
pronominally and adnominally, which is the reason that I will also refer to
them briefly as ‘demonstratives’. The form nego ‘THIS’ is used for reference
to entities close by, wo ‘THAT’ or wüo ‘THAT’ for entities somewhat further
away, at short distance, and xo ‘DST’ for entities far away. The basic
demonstrative pronoun xo ‘DST’ is also used as basis for complex forms (in
Drabbe’s analysis: compounds), in which the second member indicates a
position relative to the deictic center, like ‘upwards’, ‘downhill’,
‘upstream’. Like the demonstrative pronoun xo ‘DST’ that they are based
on, these complex forms can only be used to refer to entities at a distance
from the deictic center, and not to entities located in the deictic center:“The compounds can, therefore, never mean „this”, but only „that”, e.g. „that one up there, that one
down there, etc.”142
An overview of the complex demonstratives is given in the table below.
Note that the element go, which indicates short distance, is probably related
to nego ‘THIS’.","[207, 208, 209]"
"“There is another desire which, unfortunately, also this time we couldn’t fulfill. One would
want us to provide many and exact phonetic data about the languages whose grammatical
structure we analyze and describe; ideally, one would like to see these data accompanied
by an analysis of the phonological structure. We fully acknowledge this desire as justified,
but are not capable to meet this desire, as we know that we are not competent. Although it
is, in principle, possible to learn what one does not know, given our age and the amount of
work it would take to do such a study, which — if one wants it to lead to the desired
results — would take a lot of time, we think we serve the interests of our mission — our
primary aim — better if we spend the rest of the time that will be given to us in the same
way as before. Although we acknowledge the desire mentioned above as justified, and
although we acknowledge that our work will also in the future, seen from a scientific
perspective, contain a gap, we are nevertheless of the opinion — and we are not alone in
this — that our labour is not without merit for linguistics.”22
    “Aan een andere wens konden we helaas ook ditmaal niet voldoen. Men zou gaarne zien, dat we in
ruime mate exacte fonetische gegevens verstrekten over de talen, waarvan we de grammaticale
grondstructuur ontleden en beschrijven; liefst zou men deze gegevens nog vergezeld zien gaan van
een analyse der fonologische structuur. We erkennen ten volle het rechtmatige van dit verlangen,
maar zijn niet bij machte eraan tegemoet te komen, daar we ons incompetent weten. Weliswaar kan
men leren wat men niet weet, doch gezien enerzijds onze leeftijd en anderzijds de omvang van een
dergelijke studie, die — wil ze tot de gewenste resultaten leiden — geruime tijd in beslag zou nemen,
menen we de belangen van het missiewerk — ons eerste doel — beter te dienen, door de tijd die ons
nog geschonken zal worden, te besteden als voorheen. Het rechtmatige van bovengenoemd verlangen
erkennend, en toegevend, dat ons werk ook in de toekomst, van wetenschappelijk standpunt bekeken,
een lacune zal blijven vertonen, menen we toch — en we staan daarin niet alleen — dat onze arbeid
niet zonder waarde is voor de taalwetenschap.” (Drabbe 1957:iii)
viDrabbe concludes his preface with the following words:“Where our opponent [Prof E.M. Ühlenbeck] rightly signals the lack of exact phonetic
signs as a lacuna in our work — but, in our opinion, values this too highly — his judgment
should be explained not out of prejudice or bias, but out of his great enthusiasm for
structural linguistics. We can fully appreciate this enthusiasm, as we too consider a
structural analysis to be necessary, if one really wants to bring all secrets of a language to
the surface of conscious knowledge. We would therefore be delighted if the work, with
which we only made a beginning, would, in this spirit, be brought to completion by
others.”3
Although this book does not work within the paradigm of structural
linguistics that was current in the Fifties, it shares the same enthusiasm to
bring all secrets of the Aghu language, as hidden in this Spraakkunst, to the
surface. Not only to be seen by those who are competent in Dutch or those
who manage to get hold of a copy, but by all those who, with Drabbe,
would like to know more about this language, because“Each language is a fascinating miracle, and because it is an intense joy to analyze
such a miracle, as one repeatedly does new and unexpected discoveries.” 4
3
    Waar onze opponent het ontbreken van exacte fonetische gegevens terecht signaleert als een lacune
in ons werk, doch naar onze mening dit al te zwaar laat wegen, moet zijn oordeel verklaard worden
niet uit vooringenomenheid of partijdigheid, maar uit zijn grote enthousiasme voor de structurele
taalwetenschap, een enthousiasme, dat we ten volle kunnen waarderen, omdat ook wij een structurele
analyse als noodzakelijk beschouwen, wil men uiteindelijk erin slagen alle geheimen van een taal aan
de oppervlakte der bewuste kennis te brengen. Het zou ons dan ook ten zeerste verheugen, wanneer
anderen de arbeid, waarmede wij slechts een aanvang maakten, in deze geest zouden kunnen
voltooien” (Drabbe 1957:iv).
4
    “…[omdat] iedere taal een boeiend wonder is, en het een intens genoegen is zo een wonder te
ontleden, doordat men telkens nieuwe en onverwachte ontdekkingen doet” (Drabbe 1965: 27).

This book and Drabbe s Spraakkunst
The present book can be seen as an adaptation of Drabbe’s 1957
Spraakkunst van het Aghu-dialect van de Awju-taal. It is intended to make
the entire text collection, all lexical material, and the grammatical analysis
of Drabbe (1957) available to a wider public, including those who are not
competent in Dutch. Although the present book is entirely based on Drabbe
(1957), and generally follows his grammatical analysis rather closely, at
points I have added some of my own insights, or tried to make a connection
with relevant developments in linguistic theory that have taken place since
the Fifties (e.g. a growing understanding of clause chaining and switch
reference).","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"
De Vries et al. also argue for a genealogical link between Korowai (van
Enk and de Vries 1993) and the Awyu-Dumut language group, as part of a
Greater Awyu-family. Generally the Awyu-Dumut family (or Greater
Awyu) is considered to be part of the Trans New Guinea family, primarily
on the basis of its pronouns and some basic vocabulary (see e.g. Voorhoeve
2005, Ross 2005 followed by Pawley 2005:94). Hypotheses about any
intermediate levels of classification (e.g. with the Ok languages, cf.
Voorhoeve 2005 and van den Heuvel and Fedden 2014) remain highly
speculative, or await further investigation.

3.1.5.5 Associative pluralNouns referring to larger animals and human beings are often followed by a
3rd person free pronoun, which indicates not only the number of the noun
phrase, but, according to Drabbe, also implies definiteness, to which we
will come back below. He gives the following examples:(212)      xobasĩ         joxo          te               da-xe-nã
           men            3PL           NOM              come-N1.RLS-N1PL
           ‘the men have come’ (Drabbe 1957:5b)
(213)      kuso-kama                         joxo   si
           marsupial-kind.of.animal          3PL    above
           oŋgowim-oxe-nã
           jump.from.brach.to.branch-N1.RLS-N1PL
           ‘the cuscus animals jumped from branch to branch’ (Drabbe 1957:5b)
In addition to the single example of joxo modifying a non-subject NP,
given in note 123 above, and in addition to the cases where it is used as
part of a possessive construction (see 3.1.2 above), the text corpus contains
ten examples of joxo modifying or following a subject NP.127 In some of
these cases, the NP plus pronoun refer to ‘a person and others associated
with this person’, so that we have to do with an ‘associative plural’:
127
      These are 1.092, 1.137, 1.183, 1.271, 2.162, 6.055, 7.003, 8.014, 8.020, 8.022.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                        171(214)        axu      jobu           nisi       joxo    xoxenã.
             axu      jobu           nisi       joxo    xo-xe-nã

             ‘(...) the man with the poke and his helpers go out’ (8.014)
The text corpus also contains an example of an associative plural where the
subject is not followed by joxo:(215)      Atumio        büsiü       baxenã.
           Atumio        büsiü       ba-xe-nã
           Atumio        house       sit-N1.RLS-N1PL
           ‘Atumio and his clan mates live in a settlement.’ (5.02)3.1.5.6 Verbs implying plurality of subject or object
Plurality can also be implied by the verb, in the sense that iterative verbs
(see 2.4.1) often imply a plural object. Examples given by Drabbe are wi
saxa [shoot.IT pig] ‘shoot pigs’ and büsiü sigumùdu [house build.IT] ‘build
houses’, which refer to repetitive shooting and building, respectively, and
therefore (in most contexts) imply plural objects. In at least two cases we
have a suppletive iterative verb implying a plural subject: kü ̃ is the neutral
word for ‘die’, which may have a singular or a plural subject (e.g. 1.300
and 2.149, respectively), while suppletive iterative xani ‘die.IT’ implies a
plural subject (e.g. 2.105). Analogously, we find kunum’ i(g) ‘sleep’ with
either singular or plural subject, and kunũ xanda(x) ‘sleep.IT’ implying a
plural subject.128
128
      The form is attested in 2.2, where Drabbe adds that it combines with a plural subject,
and in sentence 5.28 of the tekst corpus.
172                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
3.1.6 Definiteness
Drabbe 1957: section 62, p. 24b; section 9, p. 5a-bAs stated in the introductory part of 3.1.5, Aghu NP’s do not need to be
specified for definiteness. However, Drabbe mentions two formatives that
imply a definite reading. First, when dealing with demonstrative
pronouns,129 he writes that the demonstrative pronoun xo ‘DST’.“often has no other function than that of a definite article, e.g. amoko xo da-xe [boy DST
come-N1.RLS[SG]]‘the boy has come’, and is also used as such with proper names, e.g.
Pemagha gho bagidi dafine P will come tomorrow.” 130
In the text corpus, demonstrative xo is attested once in text 1, repeatedly in
text 2, and repeatedly in text 6; in all cases the demonstrative is indeed
glossed by Drabbe as a definite article. In my opinion, Drabbe’s discussion
of the demonstrative and the examples attested in the texts — which will be
shown below — may indeed be taken as an indication that the
demonstrative xo is developing into a definiteness marker, a development
which is cross-linguistically very common (cf. Diesel 1999:128). 131 The
example from text 1 is given here as (216).","[188, 189, 190]"
"
Even though I have found a number of criteria to distinguish compounds
and possessive constructions, in transposing Drabbe’s text edition it has not
154                             PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
always been possible to decide whether a (group of) word(s) should be
considered a compound (written with a hyphen separating the word parts)
or a possessive construction (written with blank spaces between the words).
In certain cases, therefore, the decision between the two analyses has been
rather intuitive or even arbitrary. Given the limited amount of data and the
impossibility to check data with speakers of the language, this limitation is
unavoidable.","[171, 172]"
"
1.2.2 Syllable structure
Aghu syllable structure could possibly be rendered as in the following
figure:
24
     Drabbe gives quite a few instances of /jV/ and /wV/-initial words, but only the following
/iV/ and /üa/-initial words: io, ‘stone’, üaboxofi ‘lay down’. In these few instances, we can
contrast /j/ vs. /i/ and /u/ vs. /w/ in analogous environments: io ‘stone’ vs. jõ ‘copulate’ and
üaboxofi ‘lay down’ vs. wa ‘bad’.
25
     I have analyzed long vowels as VV. It is also possible, however, to analyze them as V. It
falls outside the scope of this book to go deeper into this question.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 1: Phonology                                   21
                    not in word-final position
(C)V(C[+nasal])
Figure 5: Aghu syllable structure
It should be noted that this syllable structure follows the assumption that
the vowel sequences given above are not part of the same syllable, but that
the second vowel of each sequence forms a syllable on its own (possibly
followed by a nasal consonant). Another option would be to consider the
vowel sequences described above as (possibly) part of one and the same
syllable, and to analyze them as sequences of two vowels. In that case,
Aghu syllable structure would have to be presented as follows:                               not in word-final position
(C)V(V)(C[+nasal])
Figure 6: alternative Aghu syllable structure1.2.3 Lexical stress
Lexical stress is on the last syllable of the word. Drabbe speaks of a “weak
accent.” Following Drabbe, I have not indicated stress in case it is
regular, and use an accent grave to indicate stress in irregular cases, as
in toxopòmu ‘some’. Scattered over the book, Drabbe gives several
examples of stress shift to the prefinal syllable caused by “a strong
connection between a word and another element.” A case in question is
the sequence sì-ke nisi [build-N1.RLS[SG]] ‘the one who builds’, where
stress has shifted from the suffix -ke to the stem (cf. Drabbe 1957:11).
22                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 1: Phonology
Another example is formed by the question particles ka and (a)xajo
discussed in 2.7.","[38, 39, 40]"

       human feet” (lit. they will put their feet down and it will lie), and starts
       searching.’(2.160)
Drabbe remarks that here the future is used in a way in which the future
can also be used in Dutch: ‘er zullen wel voetsporen zijn’, or, in English
‘there will probably be footprints’. The future, used as part of a quote, thus
expresses a degree of certainty from the part of the speaker (enough to
make him search for the track), and forms an affirmation from the part of
the speaker (in this case to himself) that a certain situation will probably be
the case.",[97]

to move to the penultimate syllable, and makes certain verb forms end in o
or u rather than e: for 1SG semifinite realis, -do or -du may be used instead
of -de, while the N1SG semifinite realis suffix -oxe alternates with oxo- (cf.
2.3.1.1). Another peculiarity is that the other N1SG semifinite forms are
followed by n, the function of which is unclear. 251 In this study n is
presented as part of the suffix, so that the n-final and vowel-final suffixes
are presented as allomorphs. Examples can be seen in (581) (baxen), (585)
(edoxòn) and (586) (küŋ-gen) below.","[357, 358]"

Drabbe 1957: section 15, p. 8Numeral clauses are formed fully analogous to adjectival clauses, with
either oxo or de as a copula. Here too, in case the copula is de, the
predicative numeral can be marked for focus (by ke) or for nominative case
(by te), the latter only in case the subject is a larger animal or human. Thus,
in (481) the predicate can only be marked for focus, while in
also the nominative marker te can be used, in case reference is made to
humans or larger animals.(481)   kesaxe     okuoman      (ge / *te)       de

      nonexistence
Drabbe 1957: section 16, p. 8-9Nonverbal clauses are negated by the use of clause final de xo ‘NEG COP’,
as in (483) and (484) below.(483)   nu        de        xo
        1SG       NEG       COP

        ‘it is not my father’ (Drabbe 1957:9a)
Note that the negative particle de is homophonous with the copula de
discussed above; as set out in 3.6, both have developed from an emphatic
marker *de. Adjectival clauses are negated in the same way as nominal
clauses; an example is given in (485). Drabbe does not discuss the negation
of numeral clauses.(485)   na        n-api             koan        de         xo

        ‘my mother is not strong’ (Drabbe 1957:9a)
Non-existence or a non-being present in a certain location is expressed by
fede xo. Consider (486) and (487) below, the former of which forms a
minimal pair with (483).

The younger of the two brothers is a (pig) hunter, the elder is a fisher.
The noun nisi causes stress shift from the final syllable of the
preceding word to the penultimate syllable, cf. 1.2.3. For the use of
nisi see section 3.1.3.
In the noun phrases efe küda and efe joxo the pronoun efe functions as a
possessive pronoun. The consistent use of possessive pronouns has not
been rendered in the English translation, which often has a definite
article. For the strong tendency of kinship terms to co-occur with
possessive or personal pronouns see 3.1.3.
The listing of the main participants at the very beginning of a narrative
seems a common narrative technique, and is applied in all of the texts
except 8a, 8b, and 9.

      One of the tests to check whether his indeed is an object would be to check whether it

      This is one of the few cases where I cannot come up with an analogous example where
the position of the morpheme is taken by a noun. This might be taken as an argument that
betaxa is developing or has developed into an adverb.

         ‘The person comes down from the back.’ (1.145)
Another example of the use of mike is the following. The context is similar
to that in (366) above, the difference being that now the event is described
from an inside perspective, using büsiü womu as a target of mi ‘come
down’ (so that the person is perceived of as coming down into the house’)
rather than as target of ogü ‘go into’ (where we have a deictic center
outside the house).","[256, 257]"

      In addition to the forms exemplified in Table 48, Drabbe also gives a series of verbs
consisting of the stems in the fourth column plus fi ‘put’, e.g. amdafi(ox), translated by
Drabbe as ‘lead towards’. These verbs are not attested in the text corpus, however, nor
does Drabbe provide examples of their use.
232                   PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesMoso(k) (~musu(k)) etc. ‘come up’ is, as counterpart of osu, used for
coming (up) into a house, probably also when the house is not a tree house
(Drabbe is not so clear at this point). Unlike osu(k), it is also used for the
movement (in this case: a movement of coming) out of a house. This must
be a case of what I will loosely call ‘analogous extension’: because stem_II
and the imperative of mo(k) ‘go in / out’ are homophonous with those of
moso ‘come up’, language users have extended the meaning of moso to
include also the meaning of mo(k). For upward movements not too far
away one uses manomoso(k) or manumusu(k), in which we can recognize
the morphemes ma ‘come’, the form moso (~musu) discussed above, and an
element nV, which apparently expresses that the movement is from close
by. The element nV is attested also in the verbs manimi(k) and manimie,
and possibly also in nego ‘THIS’.","[249, 250]"

      This argument holds as long as it is clear which NP is the subject. In the case of
multiple candidates for subjecthood, number might, in principle, be used to make clear
which of the NP’s agrees with the verb and therefore is the subject.
