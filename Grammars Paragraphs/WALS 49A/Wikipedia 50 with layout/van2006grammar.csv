A grammar of Yurakaré
  The noun phrase normally consists of a noun and optionally has modifying
elements as well (possessors, adjectives, numerals, quantifiers and articles).
Numerals, quantifiers and articles precede the noun; adjectives, as exemplified in
example (4) below, and possessors can be on either side of the head noun.
Modifiers can furthermore be extracted from the noun phrase:(2)   bëmë          wojto‐ø       ti‐tëbë
      much/many     pour.out‐3 1SG‐blood
      ‘Much of my blood is pouring out.’ [AA‐9MA‐6]Possession is marked on the head by means of a cross‐referencing personal prefix,
as can be observed in example (2) above. The noun marked for possession is
usually preceded (but it may also be followed) by the possessor noun phrase:(3)   shunñe a‐pojore
      man      3SG.P‐canoe
      ‘the man’s canoe’Number and case relations are marked by means of postpositional enclitics, which
attach to the rightmost element of the noun phrase. The postpositions marking
case relations mark the more peripheral relations: comitative, instrument, location,
direction and ablative. There is also a postpositional enclitic marking an emphatic
subject. All of this is exemplified in (4). Here it can also be observed that the clitic
status of the plural marker is somewhat doubtful, as it can appear optionally and
in addition to marking the final element, on non‐final elements as well.(4)   a   yee=ja             awissmë‐ø   shunñe  ewete(=w)     matat‐ima=w=la
          woman=EMPH         club‐3      man     broom(=PL)    big‐COL=PL=INS
      b   yee=ja             awissmë‐ø   shunñe  matat‐ima(=w) ewete=w=la
                                                 big‐COL(=PL) broom=PL=INS
          ‘The woman clubs the man with a big broom.’ (GB‐1MI‐99)Yurakaré is an accusative language, with some ergative characteristics, restricted
to a very small number of verbs. Subjects are suffixed to the verb, objects are
prefixed. Yurakaré predicate roots are either intransitive or transitive. These basic
valencies can be extended to maximally three head‐marked arguments with the
help of an elaborated system of five different applicatives (comitative, co‐
operative, objective, indirect object and affected object). Examples of such verb
roots with extended valency are the following:
                                           10
Introduction

          ‘Give them to me!’
      b   ti‐ma‐la‐che‐m
          1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐2SG.S
          ‘You ate them from me.’The entities referred to by the cross‐reference affixes in (5) may additionally be
expressed by overt noun phrases, but this is not required. The utterances in (5) are
perfectly grammatical sentences. Yurakaré, in other words, is a pro‐drop
language.
  Many temporal, modal and aspectual distinctions are marked by means of
suffixes, which come right after valency changing morphology (the middle voice
marker and causative, which are suffixed), but before the person markers. This
taken together with the object cross‐referencing prefixes and applicative markers
discussed above complete the template of the Yurakaré verb:(6)   object cross ref. ‐ applicatives ‐ root ‐ valency ‐ TMA ‐ subject cross ref.","[24, 25, 26]"
"
3.1 Introducing Yurakaré morphology
From the perspective of morphological typology, Yurakaré can be characterized as
an agglutinating language. In the ideal case of an agglutinating language “a word
may consist of more than one morpheme, but the boundaries between morphemes
in the word are always clear‐cut” (Comrie 1989a:43). This characterization fits
Yurakaré morphology to a high degree. There is some fusion, however, especially
within the system of participant reference on the verb. Here the categories of
person and number are fused, and sometimes also semantic function (e.g. in the
cross‐referencing system, cf. section 5.1). On the whole, however, Yurakaré
morphology provides us with a fairly straightforward picture of an agglutinating
language.
  On another dimension, isolating versus polysynthetic, Yurakaré can be placed
more towards the polysynthetic end, as was suggested already by the morpheme
per word ratio. I take polysynthetic to mean the possibility “to combine a large
number of morphemes, be they lexical or grammatical, into a single word,
corresponding to a sentence of English” (Comrie 1989a:45). Yurakaré, with its
elaborate person reference system and applicatives (cf. sections 5.1 and 5.2) fits
this description. To give an example, consider the following:(1)   a    ti‐ma‐y‐mala‐ma
           1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG
           ‘Go and get them for me!’ [AA‐15MA‐9]
      b    ti‐ma‐la‐che‐ø
           1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐3
           ‘He ate them from me (e.g. from my plate).’ [MV‐14MA‐26]
1I have not counted zero morphemes and I have counted bound roots + required
derivational morphemes as one. I did count enclitics. The total number of words was 6,976,
the total number of morphemes 14,289.",[62]
"
3.2.2 Suffixing, prefixing, and infixing
As mentioned, Yurakaré has both prefixes and suffixes. The categories associated
with prefixes and suffixes are roughly as follows:                         Table 12 ‐ categories of prefixes and objects
                    prefixes                       suffixes
                    object cross‐reference         subject cross‐reference
                    object‐oriented valency        subject‐oriented valency
                    aspect                         tense, mood, aspect
                    derivation                     derivation
The order of bound morphemes is fixed in Yurakaré, corresponding to their scope,
as well as to the distinction between derivation and inflection. By derivational
morphemes I mean morphemes that “form new words either by changing the
meaning of the base to which they are attached (…) or by changing the word‐class
that a base belongs to” (Katamba 1993:47). “Inflectional morphemes are only able
to modify the form of a word so that it can fit in a particular syntactic slot”
(Katamba 1993:51).
  In the following examples, we can see that inflection is generally found more
towards the edge of a word, while derivation is closer to the root. Consider first:                                                  51
A grammar of Yurakaré
(14) a    ana‐kka‐ø=ti       ka‐l‐i‐sibë‐ø
          DEM‐MEA‐3=DS       3SG‐AFO‐VBL‐house‐3
          ‘When he was this big, she made him a house.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)
      b   tütü‐mashi‐ø=w=ya
          sit‐LD‐3=PL=NVR
          ‘They stayed a little.’ (AR‐8MI‐60)In (14)a, there are several derivational affixes. On the demonstrative pronoun ana,
there is a derivational element deriving a measure ‘this size’. This derivation also
changes the word class, turning it into an adjectival element, used as a predicate
here. The derivational element is followed by a zero morpheme. I will argue for
the existence of this zero morpheme in section 3.2.5 below. In the same section, I
will discuss enclitics, of which =ti is an example. The second (main) predicate in
(14)a has its cross‐referencing object morpheme ka‐ leftmost, more towards the
verb root, we find the derivational elements l‐ (shortened form of la‐) ‘affected
object’‐applicative and i‐ ‘verbalizer’. The prefix la‐ (or l‐ before a vowel) is an
applicative prefix which increases the valence of a verb, which, in this case, has the
role of beneficiary. The prefix i‐ is a category‐changing prefix, deriving verbs from
nouns. In (14)b, the verb root is followed by a derivational element ‐mashi, which
indicates that the event is carried out to a limited degree (a little), followed by the
subject marker ‐ø and the plural morpheme =w.
  As far as tense, mood and aspect are concerned, the order seems to follow the
relevance principle (Bybee 1985), which says that an affix is placed closer to the
root the more relevant it is to the meaning of the root from a cognitive point of
view.
  The only tense marker ‐shta ‘future tense’ is found before the subject markers, as
is event‐related modality and aspect 5. Modality and aspect that is more
propositional related (epistemic) or related to expressive and interactional motives
of the speaker are external to the person markers (cf. sections 7.1 and 7.2)
  Infixing is a marginal process in Yurakaré. A first possible example of this is a
variant of the imperative singular (cf. section 6.3.5) marker <‐n‐> (with allomorph
[m]) with verbs that start with the vowel /i/. Examples of infixing of this type often
involve roots that seem to be complex in one way or another; hence we may not be
dealing with infixing after all:
5The only prefixed aspectual markers a‐ ‘incompletive and i‐ ‘verbal plural’ either replace
object prefixes (in the case of incompletive a‐) or they merge with the object markers (in the
case of verbal plural i‐).","[66, 67]"

                  low       Q                 aSyllable structure is (C)V(C), with a number of restrictions on which consonants
can be in the coda (cf. section 2.3.1). Morphophonological processes include
lenition (restricted to /k/), assimilation (mostly of consonants), elision (mostly
vowels), and gemination (both vowels and consonants). Stress assignment is more
complex. Yurakaré feet are iambic, counted from left to right; primary stress is
assigned to the rightmost dominant node and the final syllable is extrametrical.
However, there are affixes that bear their own prosodic information. Some affixes
attract (secondary or primary) stress, while yet others avoid being stressed. I call
the former stress‐attracting and the latter stress‐avoiding morphemes. Apart from
these two types of affixes, there are also prosodically neutral affixes and
diacritically marked roots.
  Morphologically, Yurakaré can be characterized as an agglutinating language on
the scale of fusion, and fairly polysynthetic on the synthesis index.(1)   ti‐ma‐y‐mala‐m=chi             ku‐ta‐ø=ya
      1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG=IGN 3SG.CO‐say‐3=NVR
      ‘Go and get them for me, she said to him.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)Verbs are usually morphologically complex, without much fusion. This can be
observed in example (1), where three participants are marked on the verb (ti‐ for
first person singular, ma‐ for third person plural object, and ‐m for second person
singular subject, as well as an applicative marker y‐ specifying the role of the third
person plural object (purposive). The ignorative marker is cliticized onto the verb.
The fact that this utterance in itself is a grammatically correct and complete
sentence illustrates the polysynthetic character of the morphology. There is no
incorporation of lexical items, however. Morpheme boundaries are generally
easily separable in Yurakaré and there is often a one‐form‐one‐meaning
correspondence. There is some fusion, however. As can be seen in example (1),
there is fusion of the categories person and number in cross‐referencing affixes,
and sometimes there is also fusion of grammatical relation markers with person
and number, as is the case with ku‐ in kutaya. In the case of the imperative there is
fusion of ‘imperative’ and number.
  Yurakaré distinguishes seven wordclasses: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs,
ideophones, interjections and clitics. The last three may possibly be subsumed
under the higher‐level category of particles.","[23, 24]"
"
4.3 Postpositional clitics
The marking of grammatical relations in Yurakaré is a mixed system of head (cf.
sections 5.1 and 5.2) and dependent marking. Less central participants are usually
dependent marked by means of postpositional clitics. Yurakaré has the following
postpositional markers:(41) =tina   comitative
     =la     instrument
     =y      locative
     =chi    direction
     =jsha   ablativeI consider these markers to be postpositions rather than case markers for two reasons.
First, Payne (1997:100) describes case markers and adpositions as two extremes of a
continuum ranging from marking central participants (case) to marking more
peripheral participants (adpositions):                                             106
The noun phrase
          Case marking is the morphosyntactic categorization of noun phrases
          that is imposed by the structure within which the noun phrase
          occurs. Adpositions are free of such configurational constraints.","[121, 122]"
"
1.4 Outline of the work and conventions
The present work is organized as follows. In chapter 2 I will give a description of
the phonological system; an introduction to Yurakaré morphology will be given in
chapter 3. Chapter 1 discusses the noun phrase (the noun and its modifiers), while
chapter 5 deals with person marking, voice and valency. The verb phrase (the
verb, adverbs and verbal particles) is the topic of chapter 6, and in chapter 1 I will
outline the verbal and clausal enclitics that function on the propositional level. In
chapter 8, finally, I will discuss both simple and complex clauses.
  The following chapters will contain many examples, which have references to
sources in the following way:(9)   tütü‐ø=ya       shinama ati        aysa
      sit;be‐3=NVR    before      DEM    Aysa
      ‘There was this Aysa once.’ (AY‐2NC‐6)
                                           18
Introduction
The reference to the source of this sentence is between parentheses. The first item
refers to the consultant, indicated with his initials, the number of the second item
refers to the number I gave to the particular minidisk; the letters refer to the place
where the sentence was recorded (in this case Nueva Canaan); the last item refers
to the track on the minidisk. Within this system of reference I also indicate
whether the data were taken from spontaneous speech (narrative or dialogue) or
whether they were obtained through elicitation. In the former case, the reference
will be between (round brackets) as in (9); in the latter case, the reference will be
between [square brackets]. Unfortunately, I have not been able to record every
elicitation session. Elicited examples that have been written down but not
recorded will be indicated as follows, with the name of the consultant followed by
‘PC’ for personal comment:(10) patta     yupa‐ø       juan    a‐tewi
     thorn     go.in.SG‐3   Juan 3SG.P‐foot:LOC
     ‘The thorn went into Juan’s foot.’ [FR‐PC]Furthermore I sometimes make use of data mentioned especially in Day (1980).
Unfortunately, this manuscript is unpaged, but it is divided into 40 chapters.
When referring to examples from the work of Day (1980) I will refer to the chapter
numbers in the following manner:(11) anu‐ta             dula‐shti
     like.that‐MID do;make‐FUT:1SG.S
     ‘Shall I do it like that?’ [DAY‐1980‐14]The number ‘14’ here refers to chapter 14 of Day (1980). Since Day (1980) does not
use glosses, these are mine in all examples that I cite from this work.
  As far as the glossing labels are concerned, a list of abbreviations can be found
on page viii at the beginning of the grammar. I furthermore distinguish
typographically between affixing, cliticization and reduplication. In this I follow
the Leipzig Glossing Rules. Affixes are indicated with a single dash (‐), clitics are
marked by the equality sign (=), reduplication, finally, is marked by a tilde (~).
Finally, I make a difference between portmanteau morphemes and morphemes
that are normally separate but that have fused phonologically. In the former case
the two meaning elements are separated by a single dot; in the latter case they are
separated by a colon:(12) bëjti
     see:1SG.S
     ‘I see it.’
                                            19
A grammar of Yurakaré
The underlying form is bëjta‐y, with a distinguishable suffix indicating first person
singular subject. The fact that this suffix has fused with the root is indicated by a
colon. The suffix ‐y itself refers both to first person and to the fact that it is the
subject of the sentence. These two meanings are separated by a single dot.","[33, 34, 35]"

                                             72
Morphology
semantic head of the noun phrase. This can be described as follows: “the head of a
noun phrase is the one word within the phrase that refers to the same entity the
whole phrase refers to” (Payne 1997:33). So in an example such as (69), we might
say that shunñe ‘man’ is the semantic head, and matata ‘big’ refers to a property of
the man.(69) matata shunñe
     big        man
     ‘a/the big man’It can be said that the NP as a whole refers to a man, not to a big. In constructions
such as the following, however, it seems that typical noun candidates are in fact
not the semantic head:(70) a   chajmu shunñe
         dog       man
         ‘male dog’ [MV‐32MA‐9]
     b   dyolojoto shunñe
         amardillo man
         ‘armadillo‐man’ 12 (AY‐2NC‐2)These are not morphological compounds, since each word carries its own primary
stress. Nevertheless, constructions such as the ones in (70) are rather marginal. In
the prototypical situation it is a property word that is in the modifying role.
  The noun is not obligatory in the noun phrase, even though it is present in the
vast majority of cases. If the head noun is missing, we are dealing with elliptic
constructions in which it is clear from the context which object is referred to.(71) a   maj~matata       ti‐jusu‐ø
         INTS~big         1SG‐want‐3
         ‘I want a really big one [i.e. field].’ (AR‐8MI‐41)
     b   sëjsëshi‐nñu tütü‐ø          ajani
         green‐DIM        sit‐3       below:LOC
         ‘The little green one [i.e. plate] is below.’ (FL‐14MA‐2)In (71)a, the reference is to a field, which has been the topic of conversation for the
last couple of utterances 13. The same can be said for (71)b, where the topic of
12 This might also refer to a male armadillo, but this particular example from a narrative
refers to a male person, who has shared characteristics with an armadillo.
13 The word maj~matata cannot be interpreted as a predicative complement of the verb ti‐jusu, (‘I want it to be big’), since then it would have to be marked with the intentional
marker ‐ni and the subordinate marker =ti (cf. section 8.2.4)
                                              73
A grammar of Yurakaré
conversation has been plates. It is only in these circumstances, i.e. when the
referent is known from the context that we can have an adjective by itself in
argument position.
  Other criteria to establish the head of the NP are not really useful for Yurakaré.
There is no clear agreement within the NP, while grammatical relations, number
and articles cliticize to the NP as a whole rather than to one of the words in it.
  Functionally, some nouns can be used as adjectives, as is shown in example (70)
above. Other such nouns are pëpë (grandfather/old), tejte (grandmother/old) and
yee (woman). Nouns can also function as predicates, without any overt marking to
signal the change of category. I will come back to this when discussing verbs in
section 3.3.3 below.
  Morphologically, nouns can be set apart on the basis that they are the only word
class that takes possessive marking in the form of personal prefixes, cf. (72)a or
predicative possession, by means of the prefix i‐, cf. (72)b:(72) a   ti‐sibë
         1SG‐house
         ‘my house’
     b   atta=jsha     i‐tanti‐ø
         other=ABL     VBL‐eye;face‐3
         ‘He had his face on the other side.’ (OR‐19MA‐20)However, some animals, i.e. pets cannot be possessed, they need a lexical
classifier:(73) a   *ti‐talipa
     b   ti‐tiba    talipa
         1SG‐pet chicken
         ‘my chicken’Property words cannot take possessive prefixes:(74) a *ti‐matata   ‘my big one’
     b *i‐matata    ‘He has a big one.’ (JMB‐PC)Action words normally cannot take possessive prefixes either, except for some
verbs. When they are marked with the possessive prefixes, these words refer to
the result of an action and are nominal:
                                           74
Morphology
(75) a   ti‐dula
         1SG‐do;make
         ‘my product’
     b   ti‐nënë
         1SG‐cook
         ‘my cooking’
     c   ti‐sawata
         1SG‐work
         ‘my work.’In conclusion, even though there is some spill‐over and the criteria have
exceptions, nouns can be characterized by the fact that they are the semantic head
of an NP, control the number behavior of the NP, and that they are by and large
the only word class that takes possessive morphology. Nouns, and
subclassifications of nouns will be discussed in more detail in section 4.4.","[87, 88, 89, 90]"

        ‘That is our language.’ (OR‐20MA‐5)Adjectives can either precede or follow the head noun. There seems to be no semantic
distinction connected to the different orders. The normal case, however, is that
adjectives are used as predicates, a point also observed by Day (1980). It is often hard
to decide whether a semantically modifying element is used as a predicate or a
dependent adjective, since there is partial overlap in morphology (cf. section 3.3).
Nevertheless, examples like (4) show that within the NP, there are two possible
positions for the adjective.(4)     shuyulë     yee=w  ~           yee   shuyulë=w
        beautiful woman=PL
        ‘beautiful women’Plurality is generally marked once for every NP. The number clitic appears on the final
element of the NP. The fact that the adjective and the noun ‘share’ a number marker (a
phrasal enclitic) suggests that they are within one and the same NP. Nevertheless, the
number enclitic is not exemplary for a phrasal enclitic, since it is often expressed on the
noun as well as the adjective, especially with the order NA. I will come back to this
point below (4.2).
  Another set of enclitics are the postpositions marking the relationship of the NP to its
head. These postpositions follow the position of the plural enclitic. There is only one
slot for postpositions; there are no instances of a combination of two or more
postpositions on one NP. An example of such a postposition is the comitative marker is
given in (5):(5)     … a‐bonto=w=tina
           3SG.P‐son=PL=COM
        ‘…with his sons’ (AR‐8MI‐64)As far as relation‐marking strategies are concerned, dependent‐marking strategies
compete with head‐marking strategies where the relationship between the verb and its
dependent NPs is encoded on the verb. This has to do with topicality and animacy.
Animate topical participants are more likely cross referenced on the verb, e.g. by
means of applicative constructions, non‐topical, inanimate participants are more likely
to be marked by means of a postposition (cf. Van Gijn 2005) 2. Postpositions will be
discussed in 4.3; head marking of grammatical relations will be the topic of sections 5.1
and 5.22
    Some relations, such as subject and direct object, are always marked on the verb.","[106, 107]"

adverb from an adjective or noun, and ba‐che is a verb that means ‘to send’. This verb
has a non‐causative counterpart ba‐ta ‘to go’, with the middle marker ‐tA.i‐ ‘verbalizer’Since nouns and adjectives can occur in predicative position (cf. section 3.3.3), there is
not much need for verbalizing morphology. There is one verbalizing prefix, however: i‐

ultimately be the possession of the maker, in (108)d the subject gets water that will be
in his possession. The example in (108)e, finally, can be rephrased as ‘he has language,
he has the word’.‐jta ‘smell’The suffix ‐jta on a noun means that it smells like what is expressed in the noun:(109) a   dyarru‐jta‐m
          chicha‐SML‐2SG.S
          ‘You smell of chicha!’[FL‐PC]

          ‘It smells nice.’ (AR‐8MI‐23)‐shku(ta) ‘comparative adverb’The suffix ‐shku on a noun, often followed by the middle marker ‐tA, derives an adverb
from a noun, and can be translated as ‘like X’:(110) a   i‐wishwi‐ø ushta       na         ishete layshu‐shku‐ta
          VBL‐tail‐3   before    DEM       agouti squirrel‐ADV.CMP‐MID

adjectives to form manner adverbs; ‐ku is harder to interpret, but it may be that it is the                                              127
A grammar of Yurakaré
ku‐ which denotes cooperative object third person (cf. section 5.2.2). The verb ta ‘say’,
which is probably the source for the middle marker ‐tA, takes the cooperative object
applicative form to mark addressees.
   First and second person pronouns can take the adverbializer ‐shku as well as ‐sh, but
if they do, they take an intervening morpheme ‐wa:(111) a   tuwa‐wa‐shku‐ta             tuwa       ta‐buybu=la   ma‐n‐dyërërë‐jti

          2SG.PRN‐WA‐ADV‐VBL:1SG.S 1SG.PRN
          ‘I am like you.’ [MH‐7MA‐7]4.4.4 Subclassification
Apart from the subclassification of nouns proper on the basis of number and collective
marking (cf. section 4.2), the class of nouns can be further subdivided into a number of
subclasses. First, we can distinguish pronouns. There are three types of pronouns:
demonstrative, personal and the question word ama.","[140, 141, 142, 143]"
"Personal pronounsThere are four personal pronouns in Yurakaré:(112) sëë    I
      mëë    you (sg)
      tuwa   we
      paa    you (pl)There is no inclusive/exclusive distinction for first person plural. Third person
pronouns are indicated by demonstrative pronouns, which will be discussed later in
this section. Personal pronouns are distinguished from other nouns firstly on the basis
of plural marking. They are the only nominal forms that have suppletive plural forms.
Second, as mentioned in 4.4.4, personal pronouns behave differently when the
adverbializer ‐shku is added, cf. example (111). Furthermore, they are restricted with
respect to derivational morphology. The only derivational affixes that I have found on
personal pronouns are limitative ‐jti and adverbializer ‐shku(ta). Personal pronouns
cannot be possessed either. Yurakaré is a pro‐drop language, so personal pronouns can
be left out. This will be discussed in section 8.1.",[143]
"The markers in (41) mark non‐central (non‐obligatory) participants; therefore they are
on the adpositional side of Payne’s continuum. Second, there is another way to make
the distinction between case markers and adpositional markers: “Adpositions can be
considered analytic case markers as opposed to synthetic case markers like the suffixes
of Turkish or Latin” (Blake 2001:9). The adpositions in Yurakaré are phrasal enclitics,
attaching to the rightmost element of the noun phrase (cf. section 3.2.5), therefore they
are analytic markers rather than synthetic:(42) a    inele     elle=y
          inside    earth=LOC
          ‘inside the ground’
      b   elle inele=y4.3.1 =tina comitative
The central relation =tina encodes is the comitative, having the same role in the
predication as a core participant (subject or direct object). The comitative participant is
less topical than the core participant.(43) na    yolojoto   shunñe a‐ye=tina             li‐tütü‐ø      a‐sibë=y
     DEM armadillo man         3SG.P‐sister=COM DEL‐sit;be‐3 3SG.P‐house=LOC
     ‘That armadillo‐man was in his house with his sister.’ (AY‐2NC‐3)The roles of the core participant and the comitative object do not have to be exactly
parallel:(44) yupa‐ø‐ya        a‐mumuy        a‐ballata=tina
     go.in.SG‐3=NVR 3SG.P‐all        3SG.P‐seed=COM
     ‘He went in with all of his seeds.’ (AR‐3NC‐1)In the above example both the subject and the comitative object go in, but the subject
actively, and the comitative object passively.
  The interpretation of =tina can also be slightly reciprocal:(45) lëtta më‐jti=ja              achu‐ta        dula‐shta‐m           mi‐ye=tina
     one 2SG.PRN‐LIM=EMPH like.that‐MID do;make‐FUT‐2SG.S 2SG‐sister=COM
     ‘Only you will do like that (i.e. making babies together), with your sister.’(AY‐2NC‐6)
                                            107
A grammar of Yurakaré
Sometimes ‘comitative’ is translated into something like ‘concerning’ (46) or a shared
location:(46) a     achu‐ta          dula‐tijti           shinama pa=tina
           like.that‐MID do;make‐HAB:1PL.S before          2PL.PRN=COM
           ‘That is what we used to do with you, and other kinds of people.’ (AR‐8MI‐87)
       b   l‐achu‐ta          ma‐n‐tütü‐ø=w      yarru=tina chajti=ya       ma‐ba=w
           REF‐like.that‐MID 3PL‐IO‐sit;be‐3=PL chicha=COM always=NVR 3PL‐husband=PL
           ‘Like that, they always awaited their husbands with chicha.’ (AR‐8MI‐90)In the above examples, the comitative object is not involved in the participant marking
on the verb. This is not always the case:(47) li‐ma‐tütü‐ø=w=ya          a‐ye=tina           inele       a‐sibë=y
     DEL‐3PL‐sit;be‐3=PL=NVR    3SG.P‐sister=COM inside         3SG.P‐house=LOC
     ‘They were inside the house together, with his sister.’ (AY‐2NC‐3)The story from which this utterance was taken deals with two persons: a brother and a
sister. The plural subject marker refers to both the brother and the sister, but the sister
is additionally marked with the comitative marker. This is a construction that is often
heard, also in local Spanish, as in e.g. vamos conmigo ‘let’s go with me’ (meaning let’s go
you and I).
4.3.2 =la instrument
The postposition =la has a range of functions; the three most common are reason, path
and instrument. I will gloss the suffix with INS for instrument, since this seems to be the
basic notion from which the other uses are derived:Reason

           ‘They say he went upstream on the Sécure River.’ (AR‐8MI‐57)
                                             108
The noun phrase
Instrument

     hit‐HAB‐3=PL=NVR      DEM     3SG.P‐head ax=INS
     ‘They hit his head with an ax.’ (AY‐3NC‐7)Notionally, the core function of the marker can be argued to be ‘instrument’ regarding
instrument as something that you can use to get from situation (or location) A to B. In
(48), bombo ‘smoke’ is the metaphorical instrument that causes a change of state of the
ancestors: from living to dead. A path is an instrument that connects two places. There
are some other constructions where =la occurs:(51) mu‐ta‐jti‐ø‐w‐ya            tuwa        ta‐buybu=la
     3PL.CO‐say‐HAB‐3=PL=NVR     1PL.PRN     1PL‐language=INS

     3PL‐husband=PL      3PL‐AFO‐invite‐HAB‐3=PL=NVR      3PL‐chicha=INS
     ‘They invited their husbands to chicha.’ (AR‐8MI‐90)The use in the examples (51) and (52) is related to the ‘instrument’ function: the
language is used as an instrument to intermediate between two people; the inviting is
done with the help of chicha.
  The examples in (53) are related to the ‘reason’ function of =la. Water and food, or
rather the lack of them, are the reasons for the starving and the almost dying of the
subjects.(53) a   imi‐ø=ya        latiji           samma=la

         ‘She was starving with thirst, craving for water.’ (AY‐2NC‐10)

         ‘They almost died of hunger.’ (FA‐6MA‐7)The path function, finally, also has some extensions:(54) a   ashaa=y       li‐ma‐ssë‐ø=w        lëshie shunñe=w      kummë=la
         above=LOC DEL‐3PL‐stand‐3=PL two          man=PL        tree=INS

A grammar of Yurakaré
These are instances of what Talmy (2000:99‐175) calls fictive motion. I will come back to
this phenomenon when discussing local cases below.
  Another use of =la as a marker of ‘theme’ is not straightforwardly linked to either
instrument, reason or path:(55) ishete    ka‐n‐dyuju‐ø      a‐tata‐shama=w=la
     agouti    3SG‐IO‐inform‐3   3SG:P‐father‐PST=PL=INS
     ‘Then the agouti informed him about his parents.’ (AR‐8MA‐52)4.3.3 Local postpositions
There are three local postpositions in Yurakaré, apart from the path function of =la. 17
The postposition =y marks the stative location of an object or person:(56) a   basu tütü‐ø       mesa=y

Class I clitics can be found in the domains of pronouns, conjunctions and adverbs.
Examples are the reduced forms of the demonstratives ana, ati and naa: an, a(t),
and na, respectively:(48) a   an=ta‐buy          tiri ta‐ma‐n‐dula‐ø=ti
         DEM=1PL‐chief      Tiri 1PL‐3PL‐IO‐make‐3=DS
         ‘This chief of ours, Tiri, he made them for us.’ (OR‐20MA‐3)
     b   a‐ewe‐ma              të‐ta‐ø        a=shunñe      a‐sib=chi
         INC‐sweep‐IMP.SG 1SG.CO‐say‐3        DEM=man       3SG.P‐house=DIR
         ‘“Sweep his house”’, the man said to me.’ [MH‐24MA‐4]
     c   dürrüm mala‐ø na=pillë‐të
         IDEO      go.SG‐3 DEM=mouth‐MID
         ‘“Bang”, the door went.’ (OR‐20MA‐1)We find the reduced forms of the demonstratives attached to other hosts as well:(49) a   na=tuwa‐wa‐shku‐ta                tuwa         ta‐buybu=la
         DEM=1PL.PRN‐WA‐ADV.CMP‐MID 1PL.PRN 1PL‐language=INS
         ma‐n‐dyërërë‐jti=ya
         3PL‐IO‐converse‐HAB=NVR
         ‘They were like us, they spoke in our language.’ (AR‐8MI‐88)
     b   na=ujwa‐ø=ya          na=buyta       itta      mappë‐n‐tanti
         DEM=look.at‐3=NVR DEM=chief          thing big‐EXC‐eye;face
         He was looking, this chief bigface.’ (OR‐19MA‐29)
     c   nish    mu‐chiya‐ø=w=ya=na              latiji          a‐tomte=w
         NEG     3PL.CO‐light.up‐3=PL=DEM        subsequently 3SG.P‐arrow=PL
         ‘His arrow did not catch fire, subsequently.’ (AY‐2NC‐5)In these examples the clitic na is not used adjectivally, but rather independently,
except for the second occurrence of na in (49)b. In (49)b and c the corresponding
noun phrase follows later, in (49)a, there is no corresponding noun phrase. Note
too, that the clitic form of the demonstrative cannot be marked for plural, as can
be observed in (49)a and c. Furthermore, in (49)c, the clitic seems to attach to the
preceding word instead of the following word. In this specific example, na is
followed by a small pause. These facts make it hard to classify these clitics as
proclitics or enclitics. The clitics an and a(t) are more restricted. They usually only
                                             64
Morphology
appear in adjectival position, and do not alternate with free forms in other
positions.
  Another group of reduced, unstressed clitics are reduced forms of the adverb
latijsha ‘then, after that, when’, which functions as a connector. The forms are lash
and la.(50) a   la=bobo‐ø=w=ja         ka‐deche‐che‐ø=w        kummë
         SEQ=hit;kill‐3=PL=SS   3SG‐meet;find‐CAU‐3=PL  tree
         ‘When they had killed him, they mounted wood.’ (OR‐20MA‐9)
     b   lash=li‐ujwa‐ni‐ø=w
         SEQ=DEL‐look.at‐INTL‐3=PL
         ‘Then they went looking.’ (FA‐6MA‐7)These proclitics do not interfere with the word‐stress of their host either. They are
themselves unstressed. They seem to be restricted to clause initial position, but the
full form latijsha (which is sometimes also reduced to lashsha, a reduced form that
still carries stress) also mainly occurs in clause‐initial position.
  Some other adverbs also have reduced forms, such as achu ‘like that’ (ash) and
anu ‘like this’ (an), ushta ‘before’ (ush). Examples of ash= are given in (51):(51) a   ash=ta‐ø=ya            latiji (…)
         like.that=say‐3=NVR    subsequently
         ‘Then he spoke as follows.’
     b   ash=mu‐ta‐ø=ya                  noe (…)
         like.that=3PL.CO‐say‐3=NVR      Noah
         ‘Noah said the following to them.’Finally, the personal pronouns sëë (1sg) and mëë (2sg) have the reduced forms së
and më, respectively.(52) a   achu         ka‐n‐dula‐y              ushta=së
         like.that    3SG‐IO‐do;make‐1SG.S before=1SG.PRN
         ‘I made it for him like that before.’ (DV‐14MA‐2)
     b   tuwi‐ø       së=ti‐bonto
         die.SG‐3     1SG.PRN=1SG‐son
         ‘My son died.’ (OR‐20MA‐5)
     c   la=ama‐shku            danda‐m=më
         SEQ=WH‐ADV.CMP         go.up‐2SG.S=2SG.PRN
         ‘“How did you get up?”’ (OR‐19MA‐9)
     d   më=mala‐m=ti               chili‐ta‐shta‐ø      an    mi‐tewi      mi‐marka
         2SG.PRN=go.SG‐2SG.S=DS clean‐MID‐FUT‐3          DEM 2SG‐foot:LOC   2SG‐mark
         ‘If you go, the mark on your foot will go off.’ (OR‐19MA‐31)
                                           65
A grammar of Yurakaré
As can be seen in the examples, it does not matter whether these reduced
pronouns precede ((52)b and d) or follow ((52)a and c) the predicate or noun they
are cross‐referenced with.
  In the examples of the remainder of the grammar, I will not indicate the
proclitics discussed in examples (48)‐(52) by means of the symbol ‘=’. I will in fact
not distinguish these enclitics from separate words in their representation, since
they do not seem to constitute one word with their host as much as the other
clitics do, as we will see. First, they do not form a phonological word with their
host as far as prosody is concerned; second, they seem to be more free positionally
than class II and class III clitics. Class I enclitics differ furthermore from class II
and III clitics in Yurakaré in that whereas the former generally have unreduced
and independent counterparts, the latter two do not.
  Before discussing class II clitics, I will first discuss class III clitics. Class III clitics
can be termed phrasal enclitics because they attach to a phrase‐final element. In
the nominal domain, the plural marker and the postpositional markers are
examples of phrasal enclitics:(53) a    matata ti‐pojore=w          vs.   ti‐pojore      matata=w
          big      1SG‐canoe=PL             1SG‐canoe      big=PL
          ‘my big canoes’                   ‘my big canoes’
      b   inele      elle=y           vs.   elle     inele=y
          inside     earth=LOC              earth inside=LOC
          ‘in the ground’                   ‘in the ground’The order of adjectives and nouns can be reversed, as can be seen in (53).
Nevertheless, the plural marker in (53)a as well as the postposition in (53)b remain
where they are: they attach to the rightmost element of the NP. Other nominal
enclitics are =chi ‘directional’, =jsha ‘ablative’, =la ‘instrumental’, =tina ‘comitative’
and =ja ‘subject emphasis marker’. I will discuss all of these in sections 4.2 and 4.3
below.
  NPs can be discontinuous in Yurakaré (cf. section 4.1). The head of the NP in
these circumstances is postverbal, while its modifier is in preverbal, focus position.
In these cases, the postpositions are still attached to the (rightmost) head noun,
while the preposed modifier does not have any postpositional marking:(54) a    danda‐shti        kummë matata=la
          go.up‐FUT.1SG.S tree        big=INS
          ‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]
      b   matata danda‐shti             kummë=la
          big       go.up‐FUT.1SG.S     tree=INS
          ‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]
                                              66
Morphology
Plural markers behave a little differently. When a plural NP is discontinuous,
usually both the modifier and the head noun are marked for plural:(55) lëshie=w ma‐bëjti         shunñe=w
     two=PL 3PL‐see:1SG.S man=PL
     ‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]Plural markers are generally found more often on both the head noun and the
modifier, even if the NP is not discontinuous, and especially with the order noun‐
adjective. Postpositional enclitics are never found on both elements.
  There are also a few clausal clitics that mostly attach to the clause‐final element.
These are modal and aspectual particles. Examples are =la ‘validational’, =bë
‘momentaneous’, =se ‘repetition (among other meanings)’ and =bëla (continuative).
They normally attach to the rightmost element of the clause, and are associated
semantically with the propositional level (cf. chapter 1):(56) a   yokkoshe      tiya‐m       mem=la
         true          eat‐2SG.S mother=VAL
         ‘You really did eat it, mother.’ (AR‐8MI‐25)
     b   li‐ma‐n‐tomochi‐n‐tu             petche=w=bë
         DEL‐3PL‐IO‐poison‐INTL‐1PL.S fish=PL=MOM
         ‘Let’s go poison some fish.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)
     c   ëshë awëwë‐ø laij ana=se
         why cry‐3            too DEM=SE
         ‘Why was this one crying as well then?’ (FL‐14MA‐1)
     d   nij     bëjta‐ø=w=ya       na      pi=w=bëla
         NEG     see‐3=PL=NVR       DEM     brother=PL=CNT
         ‘His brothers still had not seen him yet.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)In (56)a the enclitic =la is attached to the noun denoting the addressee, in (56)b =bë
is attached to the object of the verb, and in (56)c, the enclitic =se attaches to the
subject. The enclitic =bëla in (56)d, finally, is attached to the subject. These enclitics
can also attach to other parts of speech:(57) a   tiya‐y=la
         eat‐1SG.S=VAL
         ‘I did eat it!’ (AR‐8MI‐25)
     b   la     malawismë‐ø=ti       itele‐ø=w=ya      yosse=bë
         SEQ 3PL‐AFO‐hit‐3=DS        let.go‐3=PL=NVR again=MOM
         ‘When she hit them, they let her go again for a while.’ (FA‐6MA‐5)
     c   ati pëpësu ma‐mala‐jti‐ø=se
         DEM Pëpësu 3PL‐go.SG‐HAB‐3=SE
         ‘This Pëpësu used to take them with him.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)
                                           67
A grammar of Yurakaré
In (57)a, =la attaches to a predicate, as does =se in (57)c. In (57)b, =bë attaches to an
adverb. In other words: these syntactic enclitics can attach to different hosts when
they are the last element of the clause. Occasionally, an element that pertains to
the clause comes after the clausal enclitic:(58) a     mala‐ø=la       noe     li‐ja‐nama‐ø=t=chi
           go.SG‐3=VAL     Noah DEL‐3SG‐dry‐3=DS=DIR
           ‘Noe went to where it was dry.’ (OR‐20MA‐2)
     b     kani      sewe‐ø=ya=bë         tiri
           not.yet born‐3=NVR=MOM Tiri
           ‘Tiri had not been born yet.’ (AR‐8MI‐9)In (58)a and b, the enclitics =la and =bë are followed by the subject‐NP of the clause
they belong to. This is especially clear with the enclitic =bëla ‘continuative’ in the
following example:(59) nij   bëjta‐ø=w=ya na      pi=w=bëla         samu          na   ma‐mme‐shama
     NEG see‐3=PL=NVR DEM brother=PL=CNT jaguar:PL DEM 3PL‐mother‐PST
     che‐jbëshë=w
     eat‐entity=PL
     ‘The brothers had not seen him yet, the ones that ate his late mother.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)  A special group of syntactic clausal enclitics are two types of clitics that change
according to the gender of the speaker: =ri/=ra for men and =yu/=ye for women:(60) a     lat   mapakka‐ø ati‐kka‐jtë‐ø           latiji=la=yu
           SEQ big‐3            DEM‐MEA‐SPC‐3      subsequently=VAL=EXPR.F
           ‘Then he was big. He must have been about that size. (FA‐6MA‐6)
     b     shülül‐ta‐ø     a‐dojo=ye
           tickly‐MID‐3    3SG.P‐body=NB.F
           ‘Her body is tickly.’ (DV‐14MA‐1)
     c     am=chi mala‐jtë          latiji=ri
           WH=DIR go.SG‐SPC‐3 subsequently=EXPR.M
           ‘Where did he go to?’(AR‐8MI‐59)
     d     media     ora‐nñu      kusu‐ø=naja    pëpë=ra
           half      hour‐DIM want‐3=DSC         grandfather=NB.M
           ‘Half an hour, the old one wanted.’ (FL‐14MA‐1)As mentioned above, clitics cannot be morphologically followed by affixes. They
can, however, be followed by a lexical element in a compound. In (61), the stem
mujumuju carries the locative postposition =y, which in turn is followed by the
compounded noun bëshë ‘thing, entity’.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"

The noun phrase
Demonstrative pronounsYurakaré has three basic demonstrative pronouns. They take normal plural marking
and postpositional marking.(113) ana    ‘this’
      ati    ‘that’ (neutral)
      naa    ‘that’ (distal)Speakers are very liberal in their use of these three demonstratives. The proximate ana
is generally used for referring to objects near the speaker, but its use may extend to
entities further away, especially when the speaker points or gives some other gestural
cue. Naa is used for reference to entities further away, especially when they are out of
sight. Ati can be used for objects at different distances, especially objects that are closer
to the hearer. In practice, however, the three demonstratives can often be used in
roughly the same situation 26.
  Like the personal pronouns, there are some features that distinguish demonstrative
pronouns from other nominal forms. They cannot be possessed, nor can they take the
verbalizer i‐. The most productive affixes on nominally used demonstrative pronouns
are limitative ‐jti and measural ‐kka.
  The demonstrative pronouns ana and ati can be prefixed by l‐, which confines the
interpretation of the pronoun to the immediately preceding (anaphorical) or following
(cataphorical) sentence topic or proposition in the discourse, excluding other, more
distant referents:(114) a     l‐ati      ka‐n‐dula‐ø=ti (…)
            REF‐DEM    3SG‐IO‐do;make‐3=DS
            ‘when she had made him that (=arrows, preceding topic)’ (AR‐8MI‐27)
     b      l‐ati      bëjta‐ø=w=ja (…)
            REF‐DEM    see‐3=PL=SS
            ‘when they saw that (Tiri shooting birds)’ (AR‐8MI‐32)An example of the cataphorical use of l‐ is given below:(115) l‐ati=w     ma‐pu‐ø=ja           ma‐ma‐n‐chiwa‐ø=ya too=w
      REF‐DEM=PL 3PL‐take.PL‐3=PL      3PL‐3PL‐IO‐try‐3=NVR bone=PL
      ‘When he had taken themi, he tried the bonesi.’ (AR‐8MI‐36)
26This liberal use of the demonstratives in spatial deixis may be due to the fact that there are
more factors determining which demonstrative is used, e.g. (non‐)accessibility to the hearer,
previously introduced participants; functions which play a clear role in discourse functions of
the demonstratives. Further research is needed to establish this with any certainty.","[143, 144]"

4.4.1 Possession
Attributive possession is marked on nouns only. It involves a relation between two
nouns. A person prefix is added to the head noun; the dependent noun is not marked.
The possessive prefixes constitute a paradigm which shows some formal similarities                                          115
A grammar of Yurakaré
with the free pronouns as well as the object markers. There is no straightforward
synchronic derivational relationship, however:                 Table 26 ‐ Possessive markers, free pronouns and object markers

                 mi‐            mëë                   mi‐             2sg

                 ma‐            (l)atiw, anaw, naaw   ma‐             3pl
The sound /t/ in the first person possessive marker can be explained by the fact that the
free pronoun sëë is pronounced [tsQQ], with a slight [t] in the onset. The third person
singular and the plural are not transparently related. As for the prefix a‐ for third
person singular possessive, we can say that the vowel /a/ is present throughout the
demonstrative paradigm, and may have a deictic meaning. The prefix ma‐ may be
related to the word mumuy or mumay, which means ‘all’. The possession paradigm is
also identical to the object paradigm formally, the third person singular being the
exception.
  The possessive prefix is obligatory 18, there are one or two instances where the
possessor prefix is absent, but these can be considered exceptions. The possessor is
often lexically expressed, but this is not obligatory. When expressed, the possessor can
occur either before or after the head noun; the order possessor‐possessed is most often
encountered, however:(76) a      shunñe a‐sibë
            man      3SG.P‐house
            ‘the man’s house’
        b   tuwa     ta‐pojore

            ‘our deceased ancestor’s pots’   (AR‐8MI‐16)Example (76)c also shows the recursive possibilities of possession marking, where a
possessed noun (tappëshamaw ‘our grandfathers’) can in turn be a possessor (of
maoshewow ‘their pots’). Possessed nouns can be modified by e.g. adjectives and
numerals:18   With the exception of compounded possessive relations.","[130, 131]"

The noun phrase
class II, like yarru ‘maize beer’ and shuppëw ‘urine’. Looking at the body parts, the list
includes concepts that prototypically come in pairs, like meyye ‘ears’, dyukku ‘buttocks’
(and also e.g. tanti ‘eyes’ and tululu ‘lips’). There are also concepts in this class that are
prototypically singular, like, perente ‘forehead’, unti ‘nose’, ërumë ‘tongue’. However, a
noun like, pullë ‘testicle’ is a ‘normal’ count noun, which can be marked for plural.
Utensils are found in both the inherently plural class and the count noun class as well.
There are many crops in the count noun class, most of them larger crops than the ones
in the class of inherently singular nouns 13, but a noun like arush ‘rice’ can be
pluralized. 14 In short: meaning does not fully allow us to predict class membership.
This is ultimately a lexically determined matter; there seems to be a partially covert
system of number marking.
  Within the semantic categories of Table 22, class IV nouns are mainly found in the
group of utensils (all inherently singular utensils are class IV) and in bounded mass.
Especially this latter observation might give us more insight into the nature of
collectivity in Yurakaré:(34) a   shudyul‐ima kudawa
         beautiful‐COL lake
         ‘a beautiful lake’ [FL‐1MA‐4]
     b   matat‐ima       adyuma
         big‐COL         river
         ‘a big river’ [HC‐4MA‐3]The word samma ‘water’ can be used as a mass noun or as a count noun; in the latter
case modifiers are generally marked for collectivity:(35) matat‐ima      samma
     big‐COL        water
     ‘a big lake/river’ [FA‐5MA‐1]The suffix ‐ima apparently does not only denote that the quality or quantity expressed
by the modifier applies to a plurality as a whole, but it also means that this plurality is
bounded. This double function can be explained with the following overview from
Jackendoff (1991), taken from Corbett (2000:80):
13 The size of crops may have something to do with the mass‐count distinction (cf. Corbett

                  ‐bounded, +internal structure     aggregates
The addition of ‐ima to a modifier of a normal plural noun (aggregates in Table 23)
forces the interpretation that we are dealing with a bounded plurality:(36) [‐bounded,+internal structure]           [+bounded,+internal structure]If we look at substances, the addition of ‐ima forces the interpretation ‘a bounded body
of mass’:(37) [‐bounded,‐internal structure]               [+bounded,‐internal structure]It is not clear whether class IV nouns denoting artefacts can be integrated into this
analysis. A list of some of the inherently singular nouns that take collective markers on
their modifiers is given in Table 24:     Table 24 ‐ Non‐substance inherently singular nouns that trigger collective marking

          werta               basket
The items in the left column of Table 24 are artifacts, items that might be considered to
consist of smaller parts or bounded mass. For instance a comb (as well as a basket) was
made out of lianas tied together (cf. Nordenskiöld 2003b:58), knives are bounded
bodies of iron, etc. However, this explanation is rather speculative and has a danger of
being circular. Therefore this hypothesis should ideally be tested with psycholinguistic
experiments. This falls outside the scope of this grammar.
  There are contexts in which normal count nouns do not receive the plural marker in
contexts where they are plural, nor do they trigger plural agreement on the verb:
                                           104
The noun phrase
(38) too‐jti      ka 15‐ssë‐ø=ti  pu‐ø=ja        decheche‐ø=ya
     bone‐LIM 3SG‐be‐3=DS         take.PL‐3=SS   meet;find.CAU‐3=NVR
     ‘It was full of bones, which she picked up and collected.’ (FA‐6MA‐5)In the example the speaker is talking about a plurality of bones, a fact that is stressed
by the presence of the plural stem puu ‘take’ (cf. section 6.2.2). The form too ‘bone’ is a
class I noun that can be marked for plural, but here it does not take the marker =w, nor
does it trigger plural verbal agreement. This is due to recategorization of the noun too.
It is represented as a mass of bones. Speakers translate this into Spanish with había puro
hueso ‘(lit.) there was pure bone’, meaning ‘there was bone all over the place’, much in
the same way it is possible to say ‘There was dog all over the road’ in English (cf.
Corbett 2000:81).
  I have also found one instance of the reverse, where a class III noun is marked for
plural:(39) pela‐jti‐ø=w       ñowwo lëshpëni=bë
     peel‐HAB‐3=PL      manioc first=MOM
     ‘First they peel the yucca for a while.’      ñowwo pela=ya        li‐ma‐tta‐ø=w        ayma=y
      manioc peel=NVR      DEL‐3PL‐put‐3=PL     fire=LOC
      ‘When the yucca is peeled, they put them in the fire.’      latijsha ati kula‐ø=w=ti       ma‐müta‐jti‐ø=w
      then     DEM boil‐3=PL=DS      3PL‐take.out‐HAB‐3=PL
      ‘Then, when they boil, they take them out.’ (FL‐1MA‐14)In the beginning of this text explaining how to make chicha (a drink made of – in this
case – manioc), the manioc is singular in the first sentence (ñowwo is a class III noun),
but in the second sentence, in between the verbs pelaya (singular agreement) and
limattaw (plural agreement) there is a switch from singular to plural where ñowwo
triggers plural verb agreement. In the last sentence the demonstrative pronoun ati has
no plural marking, but triggers plural marking on the verb.
  It might be that somewhere in the process of making chicha something happens,
which makes the substance plural (e.g. the addition of water). This might be connected
to the fact that ‘problematic’ class II nouns dyarru ‘chicha’ and shuppëw ‘urine’ have
undergone processes (fermentation and digestion, respectively) 16. And it might also be
connected to the fact that artefacts (most of which are in class II and IV, being15 The prefix ka‐ marks a special state‐construction here. This construction will be discussed in
section (5.1) below.
16 I am grateful to Vincent Hirtzel for pointing out this fact to me.","[118, 119, 120]"

A grammar of Yurakaré
The entities referred to by the cross‐reference affixes in (1) may additionally be
expressed by overt noun phrases, but this is not required. The utterances in (1) are
perfectly grammatical sentences. Polysynthesis in the strong sense (termed
incorporating in Comrie 1989a) does not apply to Yurakaré. The language does
not allow noun incorporation into a verb, and nominal compounding, although it
occurs (cf. section 3.2.4), is not a very frequent process.
  Another way to characterize the morphology of a language is head‐marking
versus dependent‐marking, proposed as a typological parameter by Nichols
(1986). Yurakaré has characteristics of both types, although the language is
basically head marking. Possessive relations are head marked, cf. example (2), as
are core grammatical relations subject and direct object, and applied objects, cf.
example (3):(2)   a   sëë        ti‐sibë
          1SG.PRN    1SG‐house
          ‘my house’
      b   shunñe a‐bashti
          man      3SG.P‐wife
          ‘the man’s wife.’(3)   a   ma‐bëjta-y       lëshie shunñe=w
          3PL‐see‐1SG.S two       man=PL
          ‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]
      b   ti‐ma‐n‐kaya‐ma           yarru 2
          1SG‐3PL‐IO‐give‐IMP.SG chicha
          ‘Give me chicha.’ [FP‐13MA‐13]Other, more peripheral semantic roles are encoded by enclitics that mark the
dependent noun phrase:(4)   a   yupa‐ø=ya        a‐mumuy         a‐ballata=tina
          enter.SG‐3=NVR 3SG.P‐all         3SG.P‐seed=COM
          ‘He went in with all his seeds.’ (AR‐3NC‐1)
      b   ta‐buybu=la           awëwë‐ø tejte‐shama
          1PL‐language=INS      cry‐3        grandmother‐PST
          ‘The old woman was crying in our language.’ (OR‐20MA‐10)Whether arguments are head or dependent marked furthermore has to do with
topicality. The more topical a referent, the more likely it is head marked (cf. Van
Gijn 2005).","[62, 63]"
"5.1 Person marking, valency and transitivity
Dixon & Aikhenvald (2000:3) make a distinction between valency and transitivity:
“There are two main transitivity types ‐ intransitive (with core argument S) and
intransitive (with A and O) ‐ and plain and extended subtypes of each (depending on
whether or not E [extension to core ‐ RvG] is also in the core”. Schematically, this can
be represented as follows:(a) intransitive                       S
(b) extended intransitive              S              E
(c) transitive                     A         O
(d) extended transitive            A         O        EValency, in this view, relates to the number of core arguments, i.e. one in (a), two in (b),
two in (c) and three in (d). I will follow Dixon & Aikhenvald in making the distinction
between valency and transitivity, since it is a useful one for describing the Yurakaré
system.
  In Yurakaré, the distinction between valency and transitivity is directly reflected in
the formal behavior of the verb. Subjects and direct objects are obligatorily cross‐
referenced on the verb; intransitive verbs do not have object markers, whereas
transitive verbs do. Any extension of transitivity is formally marked, e.g. by means of
applicative or causative markers, even if the extended argument belongs to the
semantic argument structure of a verb.
  As mentioned, the two basic arguments, subject and direct object are both cross‐
referenced on the verb, subjects are cross‐referenced by suffixes, objects by prefixes.
The paradigms look as follows:

There is no distinction between first person plural inclusive and exclusive, nor is there
a gender distinction 1. As for the two zero elements in the paradigm, I do not consider
the zero element in the object paradigm to be actually present; it is simply a gap in the
paradigm triggering a default interpretation of third person singular, the typical
interpretation for a zero element cross‐linguistically (Siewierska 2004: 24). The zero
element in the third person singular and plural subject is a different matter. The
nominal plural marker is =w (cf. section 4.2). I assume that this plural enclitic needs a
nominal element to have scope over. Viewing the subject paradigm as such
furthermore has the advantage that it shows that the bound subject affixes follow the
same pattern as the free pronouns:                  Table 31 ‐ Comparison of free pronouns and subject markers
                                 free pronouns         bound subject markers
                          1sg    sëë                   ‐y
                          2sg    mëë                   ‐m
                          3sg    l‐ati                 ‐ø
                          1pl    tuwa                  ‐tu
                          2pl    paa                   ‐p
                          3pl    l‐ati=w               ‐ø=w
Judging from the forms of some of the markers in comparison to the free pronouns
(e.g. mëë vs. ‐m, tuwa vs. ‐tu, paa vs. ‐p) the subject paradigm and the free pronouns are
related. The free pronoun paradigm, which consists of four personal pronouns – for
third person reference demonstrative pronouns are used – shows suppletive forms for
singular and plural first and second person pronouns, whereas the demonstratives
referring to third persons are marked for plural in a regular way, by means of the
enclitic =w. This same distinction between first and second persons on the one hand
and third on the other is observed in the subject marking paradigm.","[158, 159]"

1.    IntroductionThe Yurakaré Indians form a small indigenous group that lives in the foothill area
of central Bolivia. Their language, Yurakaré, is one of the many languages in an
area that is a complicated puzzle of seemingly unrelated languages. The objective
of this book is to give a grammatical description of the Yurakaré language.
  The study of South‐American languages has seen a big increase in research
efforts at the beginning of the millenium. Looking at the situation in the Yurakaré
area alone, a number of complete grammars have appeared in the years preceding
the appearance of this grammar: Latundê/Lakondê (Telles 2002), Moré (Angenot
2002), Sabanê (Antunes 2004), Kanoê (Bacelar 2004), Kwaza (Van der Voort 2004),
Cavineña (Guillaume 2004), Mosetén (Sakel 2004) and Yuki (Villafañe 2004). Apart
from these a number of grammatical descriptions are in preparation: Sararé
(Borella in prep.), Araona (Emkow in prep.), Movima (Haude in prep.), Baure
(Danielsen in prep.), Itonama (Crevels in prep.), Arikapu (Van der Voort in prep.),
Leko (Van de Kerke in prep.), Maropa (Guillaume in prep.), and Uru (Hanss in
prep.). Finally, two important language surveys of major areas in South America
have appeared: Dixon & Aikhenvald (1999) on Amazonian languages, and
Adelaar with Muysken (2004) on Andean languages.
  It is in this growing tradition of study of the languages of South America that
this grammar appears. It is the ideal situation in the sense that it can maximally
profit from and contribute to the growing body of material.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

A grammar of Yurakaré
the role of applied objects differ across extended intransitives and extended
transitives.
  With regard to the position of overtly expressed direct objects (preverbal or
postverbal), not much can be said. In transitive verbs the odds are roughly even.
In ditransitive verbs there seems to be a slight preference for the preverbal
position, but the number of occurences is too small to draw any reliable
conclusions. There does seem to be a slight preference for postverbal position for
the applied objects, although, again, the number of instances of ditransitive verbs
is too low to draw firm conclusions.
  In most instances (82%), only one or none of the three arguments is overtly
expressed. This can be seen as another instantiation of what Du Bois (2003:68) calls
the One Lexical Argument Constraint:(18) Avoid more than one lexical core argumentThe idea behind this constraint is that, even if verbs provide in their argument
structure more than one core argument position, only one of them will be used to
introduce a lexical noun phrase. The others are mainly used for referents that have
already been mentioned in the discourse. These latter argument positions are
more often expressed either by pronouns or by zero forms. As with two‐place
verbs, in three‐place verbs, the position of the direct object is the preferred
position to introduce new referents. This apparently is a pervasive pattern in
discourse throughout the languages of the world.","[292, 293]"

4.1 Introduction
In this section I will make some general remarks on the structure and composition of
the NP in Yurakaré, with special reference to the order of words within the NP.
The template of the Noun Phrase in Yurakaré is as follows 1:                QN
(1)   [DEM              A   POSS    N   (POSS)     A ] =PL=POSTP     (REL CLAUSE)
                NUM
Noun phrases are headed by a noun, the element that determines the syntactic function
of the whole phrase (cf. Payne 1997:31). Nouns can be modified by adjectives,
quantifiers, numerals, possessor phrases or adjectivally used demonstratives.
Demonstratives, quantifiers and numerals always precede the noun they modify. All
three can be used independently as well, forming an elliptic NP of their own. Numerals
and quantifiers are mutually exclusive in one and the same NP for semantic reasons.
Demonstratives and quantifiers do co‐occur:(2)   ati      lëtta yee
      DEM      one   woman
      ‘this one woman’ (AR‐8MI‐3)Possessors are cross‐referenced on the possessed noun. Since they are cross‐referenced,
the overt expression of the possessor NP is not obligatory. When expressed, possessors
in the vast majority of cases precede the possessed noun. It is not prohibited however,
for the possessor to follow the possessed noun:1I am leaving relative clauses out of the discussion in this chapter; they will be treated below in
section 8.2.",[106]

4.4.2 Non‐category‐changing derivation
‐nñu ‘diminutive’The suffix ‐nñu is used to express small size or refinement. It is a cross‐categorical
suffix found on nouns, verbs and adjectives. On nouns it usually only indicates small
size (86), on proper names it can also mean affection (87).(86) a     ëshshë‐nñu ka‐tütü‐ø          matata ëshshë a‐dojo=y

4.4 Nouns
Nouns are the heads of noun phrases. In most cases they are the rightmost element of
the NP (disregarding the phrasal clitics discussed in 4.2 and 4.3), but some elements
may appear to the right of the noun within an NP, notably adjectives and relative
clauses. The morphological template of nouns in Yurakaré is as in (75):(75)   posssession      -   nominal root -   other derivation       verbalizationI will discuss possession (4.4.1), non‐category‐changing derivation (4.4.2) and category‐
changing derivation (4.4.3), and finally I will make a subclassification of nouns (4.4.4).",[130]

3.3 Parts of speech
As is shown in Anward et al. (1997), languages can differ from each other in
several respects when it comes to the inventory of their lexical categories. They
can differ in what kind of categories they identify; the distinction between verbs
and nouns seems to be universal (Schachter 1985:6‐7), though even that is
questioned (cf. Hengeveld 1992:67 for Tuscarora). Adjectives, (manner) adverbs
and smaller parts of speech are not universal at all. Languages can also differ in
terms of the criteria that can be used to distinguish their lexical categories. The
general approach in any language to distinguish lexical categories is that “the
primary, definitional properties of parts of speech are semantic or pragmatic,
rather than form related; (…) semantic or pragmatic features are part‐of‐speech
defining only if there is at least one formal characteristic that correlates with
them” (Anward et al. 1997:172). Formal characteristics can be found on the
syntactic, morphological or phonological level 11. Languages differ as to which of
these formal characteristics correlates with the semantic‐pragmatic features.
  These differences, together with the fact that the boundaries between the
different parts of speech are sometimes rather fuzzy (cf. Payne 1997:32), make it a
difficult task to identify the parts of speech of a language. Therefore the
distinctions I have chosen to make, although based on notional, syntactic,
morphological, and sometimes even phonological criteria, do not reflect rigid
classes with clear‐cut boundaries, but rather they reflect tendencies associated
with certain lexical classes.
  When these precautions are taken into consideration, we might say that
Yurakaré distinguishes seven lexical classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
ideophones, interjections and clitic particles. I will discuss each of the parts of
speech in turn, stating their (prototypical) notional, syntactic and morphological
characteristics as well as subclassifications. I will start with nouns (3.3.1), followed
by adjectives (3.3.2), verbs (3.3.3), adverbs (3.3.4), ideophones (3.3.5), interjections
(3.3.6), and finally clitic particles (3.3.7).","[86, 87]"

In section 4.2 above, I have characterized class I nouns as the default type: nouns that
have a marked opposition singular versus plural; class II nouns are inherently plural
and inherently collective; class III nouns are inherently singular; class IV nouns, finally,
are inherently singular and inherently collective.
  As can be observed in Table 32, the marker ka‐ as an indicator of third person
singular direct objects only occurs with class III nouns in some cases and with class IV
nouns in all cases. In constructions such as in (3), ka‐ is used as a cross‐reference marker
for all third persons singular, no matter what nominal class. In Table 33, an overview is
given of the paradigms of the direct object and the comitative object with regard to
class I nouns:               Table 33 ‐ Comparing inherently transitive with extended transitive

A second difference between transitive roots and extended intransitives of the type
exemplified in (3)b and c, is related to verbal number (cf. section 6.2.2). A handful of
verbs in Yurakaré vary in their form according to the number of participants taking
part in the event. This system of participant‐based verbal number is organized
according to an ergative pattern: intransitive verbs change form according to the
number of the S argument, transitive verbs change according to the number of the O
argument, a pattern universally attested in languages that have such a system of
participant based verbal number (cf. Corbett 2000: 253):(4)   a    mala‐y                        b   bali‐ø=w

                                              146
Verbal agreement, voice & valency
  The verb roots mala (for singular) and bali (for plural) change according to the
number of the subject participant, cf. (4)a and b; chitta and kokko 2 in (4)c and d, change
according to the number of the direct object participant. With an extended intransitive
like ka‐mala‐ø, the number of object participants has no consequences for the form of
the verb: it still changes according to the number of the subject participant. In other
words: the ergative pattern of verbal plural marking is sensitive only to the transitivity
value of the root.(5)   a   ma‐mala‐ø
          3PL‐go.SG‐3SG
          ‘He takes them with him.’
      b   ka‐bali‐ø=w
          3SG‐go.SG‐3=PL
          ‘They take it with them.’In these two respects (i.e. consistant overt marking of third person singular direct
object and no influence on participant based verbal number) the comitative object
construction patterns with other, more clearly marked applicative constructions.
  There is another construction worth mentioning in the context of the discussion on
transitivity and valency in Yurakaré:(6)   a   latijsha    ka‐posojto‐ø=ya        a‐tulujta
          then        3SG‐explode‐3=NVR 3SG.P‐brain

          1SG‐necklace=PL       3PL‐fall.SG‐3=PL
          ‘My necklace fell.’ [FP‐13MA‐13]In these constructions, the verb is still semantically intransitive, but formally, two
participants are marked: the zero element for subject and ka‐ for object in (6)a 3, and the
third person plural prefix ma‐ for object and the markers ‐ø and =w together for third
person plural subject. Tulujta ‘brain’ is a class III noun, tenchew ‘necklace’ a class II
noun. It seems that the verbs in (6) agree twice with the S‐participant. There is some
evidence, however, that the object agreement only refers to the number of the
participants, and not to the person:
2 The form jokko is a surface variant of kokko: /k/ changes into [h], spelled j after a vowel, cf.
section 2.3.2.
3 The form marked with ka‐ is not found with class I nouns.","[160, 161, 162]"

clear whether the different uses of =se are all connected. I could be that (45), where
=se means ‘again’ and (46), where =se is used in comparisons do not contain the
same morpheme as in (47)‐(60), where =se mainly adds emotional value.
Furthermore, it is not clear how to account for the range of inferences in (47)‐(60).
7.2.5 =bë: momentaneous/attention particle
The meaning of the enclitic =bë is hard to pinpoint. It seems to have two different
meanings, and is often used in conversation in various circumstances.
  In many circumstances, the particle means ‘for a while’, like in (61)a and b,
indicating that the event will take up only a short while. In this sense it is an
aspectual marker. However, in example (61)c, this interpretation is harder to                                             254
Propositional markers
maintain. It rather seems to mean something like getting attention, somewhat like
English ‘hey!’. In this sense it is a particle that functions on the speech‐act level as
an address particle.(61) a    ushpë‐shti          enrike=bë

jussives and exhortatives. The momentaneous interpretation is possible in (62)c,
but not in (62)a and b, where the attention drawing function seems to be more in
place.
  The enclitic =be is also often found on questions:(63) a    tëp     yaju‐p=bë
          what talk‐2PL.S=MOM
          ‘What are you talking about?’ (FA‐6MA‐8)

                                            255
A grammar of Yurakaré
It is not entirely clear in these sentences what =bë adds to the meaning of the
sentence. Only in (63)a the speaker directly addresses someone, (63)b and c the
question is rather rhetorical, which does not match with the use of an addressing
particle, nor does there seem to be a straightforward momentaneous
interpretation.
  Finally, the enclitic particle is also found on declaratives:(64) a   lat ma‐la‐wismë‐ø=ti               itele‐ø=w=ya      yosse=bë
         then 3PL‐AFO‐hit.with.st‐3=DS let.go‐3=PL=NVR        again=MOM

         ‘Tiri had not yet been born at that moment.’ (AR‐8MI‐9)

         arrive.SG‐3=SS     hit;kill‐3=NVR     3SG.P‐wife=MOM
         ‘When he arrived, he gave his wife a beating.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)The interpretation that can be given here is ‘at that specific moment’. This is
especially clear in example (64)b, where the speaker realizes that he has made a
mistake in talking about Tiri at that specific moment in the story, because he had
not been born yet. In (64)a and c, reference is made to a specific, relatively short
period in time where background clauses mark the circumstances associated with
that period of time. In (64)a, during the period that the subject of the background
clause was hitting them, they let the object go; in (64)c, the moment of arriving
coincides with the slapping.
  Summarizing, =bë is used to indicate specific points in time, which go with
specific circumstances, or it indicates that the speaker demands attention from the
addressee. Possibly, these two uses are connected in the sense that =bë tells us that
the speaker regards what he says to be relevant for the moment of utterance, but
not in general. However, whether and, if so, how these two uses are related
remains unclear; a definite answer to this question can only be given after
substantial further research.
  What can be said, however, is that the form =bë can be found in other words of
the language, like bëbë ‘search’ and bëjta ‘see’, as well as the special attention
demonstrative pronouns bëti and bëna, often used as a sort of presentative (cf.
section 4.4.4). These correlate mainly with the ‘attention’ meaning of bë.
7.2.6 =bëla: continuative
The enclitics =bëla and =naja are phasal enclitic particles. Phasal particles express
‘that a state does or does not continue, or that is has or has not come into
existence’ (Van der Auwera 1998:24). The enclitic =bëla indicates that a certain state                                          256
Propositional markers
of affairs continues to be true or, when attached to a negative clause, that an
expected event still has not been realized. In the first case it can often be translated
with English ‘still’, in the latter case with ‘not yet’. The form =bëla is probably
related to =bë.(65) a    ta‐la‐banna‐ø=bëla ta‐pü

enclitic, which indicates that the general situation does not change, and the old
one is still valid. In (65)a the situation was and still is that the road has to be built.
It is not finished yet. In (65)b, the speaker is talking about Noah’s journey in his
ark. There is a moment of hope that the water is subsiding, but in the end they
have to continue their journey by boat. In (65)c and d, the negation of the clause
changes the interpretation of =bëla from ‘still’ to ‘not yet’, or ‘still not’. In (65)c,
Noah’s parrot says to him that he can still see no trees coming out of the water,
indicating that the water has subsided. In (65)d the topical participant of the story,
Tiri, has been hidden to escape from the view of his dangerous step‐brothers. At
this point in the story his brothers have not discovered him yet, but they will
shortly.
  As can be seen in the examples, =bëla does not always attach to the clause final
element. It is rather free in its placement.
7.2.7 =naja: discontinuative
The enclitic =naja, like =bëla is a phasal particle. However, whereas =bëla indicates
that a certain situation is continuing, =naja indicates that a new situation has
arisen, ending the previous state of affairs. It can often be translated with English
‘already’.","[268, 269, 270, 271, 272]"

A grammar of Yurakaré
tibanti means ‘two times my hands’ (the suffix ‐juta is still used to form numeral
adverbs from cardinal numerals) and sata in lassie sata means ‘to be finished or
terminated’. Ca‐sata for 100 means ‘to be finished with it’; the ‐ve suffix is the same as
the collective plural marker ‐ybe discussed below.
  The counting in the more recent data from Day (1991) is done in a somewhat
different way: not by leaving out fingers, but by adding fingers, where apparently one
of the fingers (possibly the thumb or the little finger) does not count, so lëtta tësë (one is
standing) for seven, actually means that two are standing, plus the other hand, and so
on for 8 and 9. Tibantija chetindojo cannot be interpreted otherwise than ‘five times my
hand’.
  Numerals can undergo several morphological operations. The most common is the
addition of the suffix combination ‐ju‐ta ‘frequency’ and ‘middle voice’:(139) a   lëshie‐ju‐ta
          two‐FRQ‐MID
          ‘twice’
     b    siete‐ti‐ju‐ta
          seven‐QN‐FRQ‐MID
          ‘seven times’This use of the numerals can be made personal (data from Day 1980‐28):(140) a   ti‐n‐lëttu‐ju
          1SG‐IO‐one‐FRQ
          ‘once for me’
     b    ti‐n‐nishi‐ju
          1SG‐IO‐two‐FRQ
          ‘twice for me’
     c    ti‐n‐niwi‐ju
          1SG‐IO‐three‐FRQ
          ‘three times for me’
     d    ti‐n‐napshu‐ju
          1SG‐IO‐four‐FRQ
          ‘four times for me’In a phrase:(141) ta‐n‐lëttu‐ju    bali‐tu    uwal‐chi

      ‘We went once to Cochabamba.’ (DAY1980‐28)My scarce data on this subject are a little different from Day’s examples:

(142) a   ti‐n‐lëshie=w=ju
          1SG‐IO‐two=PL=FRQ
          ‘I do it twice.’[MH‐25MA‐9]
      b   ti‐n‐lëpshu‐j‐ta
          1SG‐IO‐four:PL‐FRQ‐MID
          ‘I do it four times.’ [MH‐25MA‐9]In (142), the numerals are made plural, and occur with the element /l/. Example (142)b,
moreover, contains both the indirect object prefix and the middle marker. The
translation is ‘to do something X times’.
  Numerals can also be prefixed with the passive comitative applicative. In this way
adverbs of time are formed (data from Day 1980‐28):(143) ti‐lëtta    ‘one day for me/it takes me one day’
      ka‐shie     ‘two days for me/it takes me two days’Many of these features seem to have been lost, at least in the areas that I have worked
in, since the consultants I worked with do not accept the forms in (140)‐(143).
Interestingly, in constructions like the ones in (140) and (143), numerals 2‐4 lose their
initial l‐. It is therefore very probably that this l‐ used to be a prefix, possibly related to
delimitative li‐. 31
  The marker ‐(j)cha on numerals and quantifiers indicates that the number refers to the
complete collection:(144) a   lëshie‐p=cha       pa‐dayu=ya                 pa‐bati

          3PL‐all‐TOT        alive:3PL 3SG.P‐son.in.law=PL
          ‘All of his sons‐in‐law were alive.’ (OR‐19MA‐30)The question word tëtëThe question word tëtë ‘what, which’ is adjectival in nature. It is usually found
compounded with the form ‐pshë, which is short for bëshëë. The noun bëshëë can be used
independently, in which case it most often means ‘clothes’, ‘animals’, ‘stuff’. Bëshëë
compounded with other words means ‘the one who (is) X’:
 It is also possible that the same element is present in lëmmuy ‘only, just; in vain’. The second
31part is probably the same as mumuy/mumay ‘all’.","[154, 155, 156]"

A grammar of Yurakaré
circumstances with forms and constructions whose basic reference is to motion. We can
term this constructional fictive motion.”
  There are more instances of fictive motion in Yurakaré: the ablative marker can mark
a stative location, and even the goal of a movement in some instances:(62) a   lëtta shunñe li‐tütü‐ø          ayma a‐pasha=jsha
         one man          DEL‐sit;be‐3 fire      3SG.P‐bank=ABL

     c   ti‐la‐dyalala‐ø    ti‐tanti=jsha
         1SG‐AFO‐spit‐3 1SG‐eye=ABL
         ‘He spat into my eye.’ [FP‐15MA‐3]If an entity is on the outside of some bounded location, it can be marked by the ablative
marker. So in (62)a, the entity Juan is on the outside of the location fire, and in (62)b, on
the outside of the back of the head, referred to by the demonstrative ana. Example (62)c
has a predicate with inherent direction (yupa, ‘to enter’), so the complement may be
marked as a stative location. Since we are dealing with a figure (mosquito) which is on
the outside of the location (eye), the complement can be marked by the ablative marker
=jsha, even if it marks the goal of a movement.
  Another extension of the locational markers =y and =jsha is that they can be used to
derive temporal adverbs:(63) a   ati‐kka=y
         DEM‐MEA=LOC
         ‘in, during that time’
     b   numa=jsha
         night=ABL
         ‘tomorrow’
     c   l‐ati=jsha
         REF‐DEM=ABL
         ‘then, after that’The first example literally means ‘in the size of that’, but can be interpreted as a
temporal adverb, meaning ‘in that stretch of time’. Numajsha ‘tomorrow’ literally
means ‘from the night’, interpreted as ‘after the night’. Latijsha, finally, is a frequently
used discourse‐structuring adverb. The prefix l‐, together with the demonstrative ati,
refers to a previously mentioned event; the ablative marker indicates that the event that
follows occurs subsequently.
  The ablative marker =jsha is also used to mark the standard in comparative clauses:
                                           112

     ‘I am taller than you.’[MH‐7MA‐7]Finally, the ablative marker is used in the following construction (data from Day 1980‐
28):(65) lëshie=w=jsha
     two=PL=ABL
     ‘one of the two’ [DAY‐1980‐28]As already transpired in some of the above examples, location can be made more
specific by the use of a limited set of relator nouns:(66) noun          meaning        locational meaning
     dojjo         ‘body’         ‘on top of’

          ‘in the inside of the house’4.3.4 The enclitic =ja
The enclitic =ja is in complementary distribution with the adpositions mentioned
above. It is found almost exclusively on subjects, but it does not mark a grammatical
relation. Firstly because, if it did mark subject, one would expect the marker to be
obligatory, and it is not. Second, it is possible to mark non‐subjects with this marker,
though it is extremely rare:(69) na       ma‐wësh‐shunñe‐jti=ja            ka‐chamashi‐ø=w

     ‘As for their father‐in‐law, they controlled him.’ (OR‐19MA‐3)In almost all cases it is found on grammatical subjects. According to Day (1980), it
serves as a disambiguating subject marker: “[it] marks the subject and must be used
when there might be the slightest ambiguity” (Day 1980‐5). Though this may certainly
be one of its functions, it also appears in sentences where there is no ambiguity at all:(70) Juan=ja        li‐tütü‐ø      sibbë    inel=chi
     Juan=EMPH DEL‐sit;be‐3 house           inside=DIR
     ‘John is inside his house.’ [FR‐1TA‐4]There is no possible interpretation that the house is inside Juan. It can also appear in
sentences where the marking on the verb in itself is disambiguating enough:(71) lëtta yee=ja         ti‐n‐wita‐ø
     one woman=EMPH       1SG‐IO‐arrive.SG‐3
     ‘A woman came to me.’ (AR‐8MA‐24)In sentences without any complement it can also appear, even when there is no one to
confuse the subject with:(72) së=ja            ulë‐y
     1SG.PRN=EMPH guayabochi.tree‐1SG.S
     ‘I was the guayabochi tree.’(AR‐8MA‐7)
                                            114
The noun phrase
And it is also used in the following way:(73) mi‐meme=ja
     2SG‐mother=EMPH
     ‘And your mother? (where is she?)’Its main function is to mark emphatic topics. This is its function in the examples (70)‐
(73). For instance, the context of the myth from which example (72) is taken is that a
man changed from a guayabochi tree into a man, because a woman always scratched
that tree. He appears before the woman and says that he was the one that was the
guayabochi tree (he and no other), which could be translated into English with a cleft
construction: “it was I who was the guayabochi tree”. In (69), where a non‐subject is
marked with =ja there is a switch of topic. In the preceding context the subjects of the
sentence first punished their father‐in‐law for something he did to them, and then they
punish their spouses, then the utterance in (69) follows. Finally, sudden appearances of
participants in a story are often marked with =ja (from the same story):(74) latijsha maj~matata     wowore=ja       tütü‐ø=ya        püü=y
     then     INTS~big       snake=EMPH sit;be‐3=NVR road=LOC
     ‘Then (suddenly) there was a big snake on the road.’ (AR‐8MA‐77)In conclusion we can say that =ja is a marker of emphatic topic and not of subject.","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130]"

root, cf. the examples in (84)a, or a metaphorical extension of the nominal root cf. (84)b
(cf. also section 4.4.2):

marker. A cigarette case is not really a house, but from the perspective of the cigarettes

can be said to be a house 18. The same holds, mutatis mutandis, for example (86)b:(86) a    bishmi‐ta      a‐sibë‐të

          ‘womb (the house of her child)’  With some nouns, the middle marker can have the effect of deriving nouns of the
type former‐X:(87) a    ti‐sibë      ‘my house’           ti‐sibë‐të    ‘my former house’
     b    ti‐jukkulë   ‘my field’           ti‐jukkulë‐të ‘my former field’

18 Note that sibë‐të can either mean ex‐house or a metaphorical extension of the concept ‘house’.
In this case only the latter interpretation is exemplified.
19 I have no explanation for the deviant form of the root here (ñabaw instead of ñaba) or in theprevious example (bashta instead of bashti).","[187, 188, 189, 190]"

The noun phrase
 Proper adjectives (attributively used adjectives) hardly receive any morphological
marking. The collective and distributive markers mentioned above are found on
adjectives (but also on quantifying modifiers). Apart from these markers, adjectives can
be marked by the diminutive ‐nñu (partially discussed in section 4.4.2 above), the
amplifier ‐lë (partially discussed in 4.4.3 above) and the intensifier prefix (also found on
verbs), which is a partial reduplication followed by the sound /j/.‐nñu: diminutive, affectionThe suffix ‐nñu is, next to nouns (cf. 4.4.2) also found on some adjectives (and verbs, cf.
6.4.1). To stress the small size of something, the adjective ñuñuju(‐lë) can be marked
with the diminutive marker. Other adjectives, such as shudyulë ‘beautiful’ can also take
the diminutive marker:(127) a   ñuñujulë‐nñu‐ø ta‐ëtëjñu
          small‐DIM‐3          1PL‐son
          ‘Our son is very small’ [FL‐2MA‐16]
      b   todito anu           shuyulë‐nñu‐ø (…) a‐alparatu‐nñu
          all    like.this     beautiful‐DIM‐3        3SG‐adornment‐DIM:PL
          ‘All its little adornments were beautiful.’ (OR‐20MA‐9)The diminutive marker ‐nñu can also mean endearment; the speaker is moved by what
is happening:(128) shuyu‐nñu‐sh         a‐pumi‐ø
      beautiful‐DIM‐ADV INC‐blow‐3
      ‘He is whistling beautifully.’ (AY‐3NC‐32)‐lë amplificationThe suffix ‐lë on an adjective amplifies its meaning:(129) a   ana‐ja‐lë

      b   latijsha idojo‐lë         mashi‐ø

A grammar of Yurakaré
In (129)a, the marker ‐lë is found on a derived pronominal measure adjective. This
combination is somewhat lexicalized, since it always means ‘very small’, in spite of the
fact that ana‐kka 27 is neutral with regard to big or small. In (129)b, the verb/adverb idojo,
which in this context is a grammaticalized marker of augmentation, is marked with ‐lë
to amplify its meaning. In (129)c, finally, ‐lë is used in a comparative construction. It is
not obligatory here, so it is not a case of comparative marking; it simply amplifies the
meaning of pëpë ‘old’. The fact that this is a comparative is marked by the ablative
postposition =jsha.
  The amplification marker is also found on (pro)nouns and verbs:(130) eskwela l‐ana‐lë=y             dula‐shti           ti‐sibë
      school    REF‐DEM‐AMP=LOC      do;make‐FUT:1SG.S 1SG‐house
      ‘I am going to build my house near the school.’ [MH‐24MA‐6]In (130), the pronoun ana carries the marker ‐lë as well as the referential prefix l‐. This
combination of morphemes is lexicalized and means ‘close by’.intensifier reduplicative prefixThe meaning of a verb or adjective can be stressed or intensified by partially
reduplicating the stem, followed by ‐j‐:(131) a      maj~matata
             INTS~big
             ‘really big’

             ‘He walked really far.’adverbializer ‐shAn adjective can be made into an adverb by means of the suffix ‐sh:(132) nish        sëmë~sëmë‐sh      winani‐tijti
         NEG      bald~bald‐ADV     walk‐HAB.1PL.S

2.4.7 Discourse‐based stress
Stress can be used for pragmatic purposes. This is especially important for deictic
words. I have found differences such as the following:(75) unmarked        ~ marked         gloss
     latíjsha        ~ látijsha       ‘after that’
     achúta          ~ áchu(ta)       ‘in that way’
     anúta           ~ ánu(ta)        ‘in this way’
     achàmatíjsha    ~ àchamátijsha   ‘in spite of that’These stress differences are caused by pragmatic highlighting, just as in English
you can say: ‘after THAT’ and ‘AFter that’.
  Stress as a pragmatic device is not grammaticalized, i.e. obligatory, but it may
very well be that the heavy prefix‐rule (cf .2.4.2) was originally a pragmatically
driven stress rule
  Sentence intonation can also marginally influence stress‐placement. Medial
clauses form an intonational phrase, and they are characterized by a higher pitch
at the penultimate syllable, which is maintained at the final syllable. Higher pitch
often coincides with stress in Yurakaré. This can override all other prosodic
constraints:

pattern would be lë$jëlë@shtati. This is overruled by intonational pitch and stress,
which can cause stress to fall on the penultimate syllable of the intonation phrase.
In the case of ottoja, the first syllable is heavy and so we would expect the stress
pattern to be óttoja. But, again, this is overruled by intonational stress.
  In some cases, intonational stress can fall on the last syllable of the intonation
phrase.(77) [yutíche    li‐jà‐n‐tütü‐ø=tí]IP     bobó‐ø=w=ya

3.        MorphologyYurakaré is a polysynthetic and agglutinating language (cf. section 1.2.3 above).
This means that morphology is one of the most important means for coding
meaning in Yurakaré. Yurakaré words are usually morphologically complex. A
quick count 1 of four narratives showed an average of 2.05 morphemes per word.
 In this chapter I will discuss the general principles of Yurakaré morphology. I
will start by giving a short sketch of Yurakaré morphology (3.1), followed by an
overview of the morphological units and processes (3.2) and a discussion of the
parts of speech in Yurakaré (3.3).","[60, 61, 62]"

very frequent construction as a relativizing strategy, there is another, more widely
used strategy to form subject relative clauses by means of a compound of the verb
with the noun bëshë ‘ thing, entity’, cf. section 8.2.6 below.
8.2.4 ti‐marked clauses
Clauses marked with the enclitic =ti are characterized grammatically as follows:    (i)     one or more of the predicates are marked with the enclitic =ti;
    (ii)    The =ti‐marked predicate as well as the main verb are marked for
            person;
    (iii)   The ti‐predicate has no limitations on its TMA possibilities, nor is it
            dependent on the main predicate for its TMA organization;
    (iv)    There is
            a. either no coreferentiality between the subjects of the ti‐clause and
               the main clause;
            b. or the ti‐clause has a case marker on it, in which case there may be
               subject‐coreferentiality.","[324, 325]"

Verbal agreement, voice & valency
  The beneficiary reading of the direct object can be observed in the following
instances:(23) a    ti‐n‐dula‐ø        ti‐sibë
          1SG‐IO‐do;make‐3 1SG‐house
          ‘He made me my house.’ [RF‐16MA‐12]
      b   ti‐n‐ewe‐ø      ti‐sibë=y

          1SG‐IO‐wash‐3   1SG‐entity 6
          ‘She washed my clothes for me.’ [FL‐10MA‐2]Verbs denoting states, processes or achievements also often carry this applicative. The
indirect object denotes the person that benefits from the state of affairs that has arisen:(24) a    ti‐n‐duta‐ø      ayma
          1SG‐IO‐burn‐3 fire
          ‘The fire is burning (after I prepared it).’ [AA‐17MA‐2]
      b   ti‐n‐kula‐ø      ti‐chata
          1SG‐IO‐boil‐3 1SG‐food
          ‘My meal is boiling.’ [FP‐16MA‐15]
      c   ti‐n‐sa‐ø=naja         ti‐sawata
          1SG‐IO‐finish‐3=DSC 1SG‐work
          ‘My work is done.’ [VP‐22MA‐8]
      d   nij      ti‐n‐suwita‐ø          ti‐ballata
          NEG      1SG‐IO‐come.up‐3       1SG‐plant.seed
          ‘My plants are not coming up.’ [FL‐10MA‐2]In all of the examples in (24) the indirect object profits somehow from the coming
about of a state. This benefit often has to do with the fact that the indirect object is the
possessor of one of the core participants, a construction known as external possession.
Core instances of external possession are described as “constructions in which a
semantic possessor‐possessum relation is expressed by coding the possessor as a core
grammatical relation of the verb and in a constituent separate from that which contains
the possessum” (Payne & Barshi 1999:3). Note that we are not dealing with possessor
raising here, since the possessor may still be marked on the noun, as is the case in
(24)b‐d.
  The indirect object can sometimes also mark a detrimentally affected dative of
interest:
6Bëshëë (which loses its final vowel when prefixed with a singular possessive prefix) has a
rather vague meaning, but it is often interpreted as ‘clothing’, sometimes ‘game’ for hunting.","[169, 170]"

the Macro‐Quechuan network, including inter alia nearby languages such as
Quechua, Itonama, Mosetén, and Cayuvava. Greenberg (1960, 1987) and Key
(1979) classify Yurakaré as an equatorial language, in the Andean‐Equatorial
stock, along with, among others, Cayuvava, Arawak, and Tupi languages. Suárez
(1974) links Yurakaré to Mosetén (something which had been suggested by
Metraux in a personal comment to Mason 1950:275) and Chon languages, as well
as to Pano‐Tacanan in a stock he calls Macro‐Pano‐Tacanan.
  All authors that have considered Yurakaré in their classification base their
proposals on La Cueva (1893), which is a rich source, but not rich enough to justify
these classifications (cf. Suárez 1974:137‐138). Secondly, the correspondences they
find are not overwhelming, as confirmed by Campbell (1997:192) and Adelaar
with Muysken (2004:27‐29). Using a word list with 133 items, Greenberg (1987)
only finds 22 correlates for Yurakaré, some of which are rather far off from their
cognate examples both formally and notionally. The highest number of lexical
correlations that Suárez (1974) finds for Yurakaré is with Tacana (14 out of 100 ‐ cf.
Suárez 1974:138). He also finds some systematic correspondences in the
pronominal system, some grammatical categories and phonology, but these are
sometimes due to errors in La Cueva’s grammar (e.g. causative ma‐, focus marker ‐
ya, negator chama).
  In the light of these controversies, it is best to regard Yurakaré as an unclassified
language, for which convincing evidence has not (yet) been found to classify it
with (an)other language(s) in a larger group. Hopefully this grammar will
contribute to shed some more light on this issue.","[22, 23]"

3.3.3 Verbs
Verbs are prototypically actions: agentive actions involving concrete participants,
having a relatively short duration, and spatially more diffuse than nouns (Givón
2001‐I:52).
  The typical function of a verb is the predicative function (Croft 2003:184‐185,
Schachter 1985:9). This is not a distinguishing feature of verbs in Yurakaré,
however. Nouns and adjectives can also function as (stative) predicates without
any overt formal marking that indicates a change in lexical category.(86) a   së=ja              ulë‐y
         1SG.PRN=EMPH guayabochi.tree‐1SG.S
         ‘I was that, I was the guayabochi tree.’ (AR‐8MI‐7)
     b   Arsenio=ja         poropesor‐shta‐ø=la
         Arsenio=EMPH teacher‐FUT‐3=VAL
         Arsenio will be a teacher.’ [AT‐3MI‐121]Example (86)a is taken from a mythological text in which a Guayabochi tree
changes into a person. Now this person is telling a woman that he was the
Guayabochi tree. The subject sëja is marked with the emphasis marker =ja, which
appears almost exclusively on subjects. Furthermore, the predicate ulëy takes the
subject cross‐reference marker ‐y for first person singular. The word that functions
as a predicate has the notional characteristics of a noun, referring to a concrete,
                                            79
A grammar of Yurakaré
even specific item. In (86)b the predicate nominal is marked for future tense, a
category normally associated with verbs.
  Some predicate nominals can even take applicative prefixes. In the following
examples the affected object applicative (cf. 5.2.4) triggers the interpretation of
detachment in (87)a; in (87)b, the attachment‐reading is caused by the indirect
object applicative (cf. 5.2.3):(87) a   më=ja              ka‐la‐uli‐m               pa=ja             ka‐la‐uli‐p
         2SG.PRN=EMPH 3SG‐AFO‐penis‐2SG.S             2PL.PRN=EMPH 3SG‐AFO‐penis‐2PL.S
         ‘You (sg) cut off his penis; you (pl) cut off his penis.’(OR‐19MA‐2)
     b   li‐ma‐n‐shansha‐shta‐ø        latiji
         DEL‐3PL‐IO‐tooth‐FUT‐3        subsequently
         ‘He provided them with teeth.’ (AR‐8MI‐35)In (87)a, the predicate function is performed by a noun, which also refers to a
concrete and specific object. Like in (86)a, this predicate takes subject cross‐
reference marking (for second person singular and plural) and the overtly
expressed subject argument is marked with the emphasis marker =ja. However, in
(87)a we can also see that the object word can take valency increasing morphology
(the prefix la‐ for affected object ‐ cf. section 5.2.4) and consequently an object
complement, referring to the person who got his penis cut off. In (87)b, the
predicate nominal, not specific this time, takes another kind of applicative and is
modified by an adverb. Furthermore it takes the future tense marker ‐shta.
  Adjectives can be used as predicates as easily as object‐words (nouns):(88) a   maj~matata‐ø=ya latiji               a‐jukkulë
         INTS~big‐3=NVR      subsequently 3SG.P‐field
         ‘His field was then really big.’ (AR‐8MI‐42)
     b   yita‐p=naja
         good‐2PL.S=DSC
         ‘You are alright now.’ (AR‐8MI‐37)
     c   tëtë‐pshë=ja (…)      mij~mi‐n‐shuyulë‐jti‐ø        meme
         what‐entity=EMPH      INTS~2SG‐IO‐beautiful‐HAB‐3   mother
         ‘What do you find really beautiful, mother?’ (AR‐8MI‐50)In (88)a the property word functions as a predicate (cf. the non‐veridical enclitic
=ya, which only attaches to predicates. In (88)b, the property word yita takes the
subject marker ‐p for second person plural, and in (88)c, shuyulë takes the
applicative marker n‐ as well as the habitual marker ‐jti.
  Verbs, in short, cannot be distinguished from adjectives and nouns on the basis
of their function as predicates. However, verbs cannot be arguments of predicates
without any overt marking. They can be arguments of verbs either when they

           ‘I finished harvesting rice (my harvesting rice is finished for me)’ [MH‐24MA‐4]There is no clear answer to the question whether the ti‐marked clause indicates a
‘when’‐clause rather than a real argument, i.e.: ‘When I had harvested my rice I
was finished.’ However, ti‐marked clauses can take postpositions, which are
normally associated with noun phrases:(90) mashi‐ø=ti=jsha       ajuyja‐shta‐tu
     rain‐3=DS=ABL         fish‐FUT‐1PL.S
     ‘Even if it rains we’ll go fishing.’ [MV‐24MA‐22]There are also constructions such as the following:(91) nij  poyde winani‐tu     puwa‐tu=ja
     NEG can      walk‐1PL.S drunk‐1PL.S=SS
     ‘We could not walk when we were drunk.’ [FA‐28MA‐1]The sequence poyde winanitu seems to be a case where a verb (winanitu), without
any further measures being taken is used as an argument of the verb (Hengeveld’s
1992 criterion). However, on closer scrutiny, there seem to be measures that have
been taken after all. The matrix verb poyde does not carry any subject marking, and
is conjoined to the adjacent VP. In fact, as I will be discussing in chapter 8.2.1, this
is one way of marking subordination. The matrix verb can also be fully inflected,
but then the complement verb has to be marked by means of the enclitic =ti.(92) nij     poydi=la           ma‐alkansa=ni=ti
     NEG     can:1SG.S=VAL      3PL‐reach‐INTL:1SG.S=DS
     ‘I couldnʹt reach them.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)Action‐words can modify a noun only if they are marked as a relative clause by
means of the different subject marker =ti, the same subject marker =ja, or by means
of a compound with bëshë (reduced to pshë) ‘entity’. In (93)c we again see that
nouns can be in adjectival function as long as their meaning allows for it:

3.3.4 Adverbs
There is a rather small class of adverbial elements. Adverbs differ from nouns,
verbs and adjectives in that they cannot take any inflection. They usually have a
more limited distribution as well
  In Table 16, some examples are given of inherent adverbs in Yurakaré. Although
these are now fixed expressions, one can still see that at least some of these
adverbs were once composed of smaller units. Some of them have a relation with
the demonstrative pronouns ati, bëti or ana: time adverbs shinama, latiji, atijshija
and possibly tishilë, aspect adverbs chajti, achaya and lacha. The intensity adverb
mapakka is analyzable as mappë‐kka ‘big‐MEA’, ñuñuju or ñunku is related to the
adjectival stem ñuñujulë ‘small’, and binta also occurs as a verb meaning ‘be
strong’ or ‘hurt’. Furthermore, many time adverbs, as well as manner adverbs ëshë
and yokkoshe have an element /S/ or /Si/ in them. There is an affix ‐sh(i) in Yurakaré,
cf. sections 3.3.2, 4.4.3 and 6.4.3, which is used to form adverbs. This morpheme
may have played a role in the formation of some of these adverbs. Nevertheless,
even though many of these adverbs may once have been derived from non‐
adverbs, synchronically there is a class of adverbs which can no longer be
analyzed any further.",[97]

          ‘in the time of their harvest’ [DAY‐1980‐35]4.4.3 Category‐changing derivation
There are three category‐changing derivational suffixes that can be found on nouns: an
adjectivizer ‐kka, a verbalizer i‐ and an adverbializer ‐shku(ta).‐kka: ‘measure’The suffix ‐kka is added mostly to demonstrative pronouns to indicate that the size of
something is comparable to a size indicated (mostly by holding the hand on a certain
height).(98) ana‐kka‐ø
     DEM‐MEA‐3
     ‘He is this big.’ (indicating height with hand)The suffix ‐kka changes the nominal element into an adjectival one; consequently it can
receive the collective marker ‐ima or the distributive marker ‐uma:(99) a‐werta        ana‐kk‐ima
     3SG.P‐basket   DEM‐MEA‐COL
     ‘His basket was about this big.’ (AY‐3NC‐7)It is also found on proper names (100), as well as on the question word ama (101):(100) ti‐tëë                karina‐kka     ati
      1SG‐niece;nephew      Karina‐MEA     DEM
      ‘She was the size of Karina.’ (BT‐27MA‐10)(101) aj~ama‐kka        mi‐jusu‐ø     ta‐jukkulë    mi‐n‐dula‐ni=ti
      INTS~which‐MEA    2SG‐want‐3 1PL‐field        2SG‐IO‐do;make‐INTL:1SG.S=DS
      ‘What size would you like me to make our field?’ (AR‐8MI‐41)The suffix ‐kka in the sense of size is often found in combination with the amplification
marker ‐lë. When this suffix is attached, the marker ‐kka loses its gemination and is
                                            124
The noun phrase
rendered ‐ja after a vowel (because of the lenition of [k], see section 2.3.2 above). The
interpretation of this combination is small size:(102) kumë‐nñu ana‐ja‐lë               ajtilya‐nñu       ti‐ja‐mal‐cha‐m
      tree‐DIM     DEM‐MEA‐AMP         splinter‐DIM      1SG‐3SG‐go.SG‐JUS‐2SG.S
      ‘Bring me a small tree, only this size, a splinter!’ (OR‐20MA‐2)Even though the marker seems to attach mostly to nominal elements, it can also appear
on the verb abibë ‘to be enough’:(103) abibë‐kka‐ø‐naja          ta‐jukkulë
      be.enough‐MEA‐3‐DSC       1PL‐field
      ‘Our field is big enough now.’ (AR‐8MI‐42)As mentioned in section 4.3 above, in combination with the locative marker =y and the
ablative marker =jsha, this suffix can also indicate a certain stretch of time:(104) a   nentaya    ati‐kka=y          ka‐toro‐ø      ati
          maybe      DEM‐MEA=LOC        3SG‐end‐3      DEM
          ‘Maybe he died in that time.’ (AR‐8MI‐88)
      b   latijsha dula‐ø         ati‐kka=jsha       kokko       mala‐cha‐m
          then     do;make‐3 DEM‐MEA=ABL             throw.PL go.SG‐JUS‐2SG.S
          ‘Then he made [salt], and after that time (she said): “Leave me some.”’
                                                                             (AR‐8MI‐82)In this sense of time reference, the suffix ‐kka seems less rigid as to the word class of the
root it attaches to. This is probably for semantic reasons: to indicate the size of
something presupposes a root that has some size, while in the temporal sense, it only
presupposes a state or event that is (or can be) durative, even though some speakers
have difficulties interpreting the following words 25:
25These examples are taken from a traditional song, which not many people know anymore.
Consultants said that the language of traditional songs is somewhat different from everyday
speech. Possibly, the examples in (105) are not very good representatives of what is and what is
not possible in the language.","[138, 139, 140]"

6.3 Mood & modality
As with aspect, many modality distinctions are encoded by means of propositional
enclitics, which will be the topic of the next chapter. Here we are concerned with event
modality, which is “concerned with the speaker’s attitude towards a potential future
event” (Palmer 2001:8).
6.3.1 intentional ‐ni
The marker ‐ni indicates an action or state that has not (yet) taken place, which
nevertheless is in many cases an expected or even purposive reality. It has the
following functions:(39) a    wish
          anu‐ta           i‐jamio‐ni              laij=yu
          like.this‐MID    VBL‐car‐INTL:1SG.S      too=EXPR.F
          ‘I wish I would have a car like this too.’[RF‐26MA‐7]
     b    exhortative
          dula‐n‐tu                ta‐pojore
          do;make‐INTL‐1PL.S       1PL‐canoe
          ‘Let’s make our boat.’      (OR‐20MA‐1)
      c   comissive
          at=chi       mala‐ni              ta ‐ø=ya
          DEM=DIR      go.SG‐INTL:1SG.S     say‐3=NVR
          ‘“I am going there now”, he said to him.’ (AR‐8MI‐58)
      d   presupposition
          tëtë‐pshë      ka‐tütü‐ni                të‐ta‐jti‐p=chi
          what‐entity 3SG‐sit;be‐INTL:1SG.S 1SG.CO‐say‐HAB‐2PL.S=IGN
          ‘What are you saying that I should have?’ (AR‐8MI‐23)
                                          196
The verb phrase
      e     complement of a number of matrix verbs
            ti‐jusu‐ø       mi‐n‐dyuju‐ni=ti …
            1SG‐want‐3 2SG‐IO‐tell‐INTL=DS
            ‘I want to tell you…’ (AR‐8MI‐82)In all of these examples the function of ‐ni is slightly different, but they all have in
common that they encode a non‐factual event. In (39)a, ‐ni indicates that we are dealing
with a wish; in (39)b, the /i/ is dropped before the first person plural marker,
exhortative action is marked. In (39)c ‐ni has a similar meaning as in b, but the meaning
can also be purely aspectual, not much different from the near completive marker ‐nishi
discussed in section 6.2:(40) li‐ti‐ja‐n‐tta‐ma          lumulu aye‐ni
     DEL‐1SG‐3SG‐IO‐put‐IMP.SG  warm      vomit‐INTL:1SG.S
     ‘Put on some warm water for me, I am about to vomit.’ (OR‐19MA‐30)In (39)d, ‐ni marks a presupposed, but not actualized situation. It can often be
translated with the English adverb ‘supposedly’. In (39)e, finally, ‐ni is found as a sort
of subjunctive marker. It is found in complements of verbs of desire, lack, fear etc, that
subcategorize for events that have not taken place yet. For more on this see sections
8.2.1, 8.2.4, and 8.2.7.
  Even though ‐ni cannot always be translated as intentional action, I gloss it this way.
Firstly because the intentional reading (commissive and exhortative) is the most
frequently encountered function of ‐ni, but also because other uses of ‐ni can often be
analyzed in this way. For instance some of the occurences where ‐ni marks a
complement:(41) nij       poydi=la         ma‐alkansa‐ni=ti
      NEG      can:1SG.S=VAL    3PL‐reach‐INTL=DS
      ‘I could not, when I intended to reach them.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)Furthermore, the ‘wish’‐reading is only possible in combination with the expressive
marker =yu (women) or =ri (for men).
  When ‐ni is combined with a non‐first person, the interpretation is often that the
event is to take place at another location than the current position of the subject
(translocative):

            ‘Go and look!’ (FA‐6MA‐7)

            ‘Go to the jungle and find some [food] there.’ (AR‐8MI‐65)The marker ‐ni on nouns indicates that the entity is foreseen to come into existence:(44) a      mala‐ø=ja     ëwwë‐ø=ya elle           a‐sibë‐ni
            go.SG‐3=SS    dig‐3=NVR ground 3SG.P‐house‐INTL

            ‘I am going to go and look for our pets‐to‐be.’ (AR‐8MI‐51)In both examples of (44) there is talk of a future entity, an entity that does not exists as
such yet. In (44)b, the animals that the agent is going to search for already exist, but not
in the function of his pets.
  In (44)b there is also a double intentional marker. If the marker ‐ni is followed by
another TMA suffix (including a second ‐ni), its meaning is again translocative:
4   The locative interpretation might also be due to the delimiter prefix li‐, cf. section 6.4.2.","[211, 212, 213]"

which the speaker mixes up the main characters of the story and then finds out
about her mistake. She then continues to set things straight by explicitly stating
the roles that the main characters have. The subjects of (22)d‐f are pre‐verbal and
in contrastive focus.
  In general, then, we can say that VS is the pragmatically more neutral order;
preposing a subject gives some kind of emphasis to it. The fact that the pre‐verbal
position is pragmatically marked is corroborated by the fact that question words
are always sentence‐initial, regardless of their semantic or syntactic role (more
discussion on questions in the next section):(23) a       të‐pshë         li‐tütü‐ø     na     ashaa=chi              (subject)

             ‘Who are you washing for?’ [VL‐24MA‐13]  As far as the position of objects is concerned, no clear preference for pre‐ or
postverbal position can be given in terms of frequency. Preverbal and postverbal
objects (O as well as E) occur in about equal proportions.
  Typological research in the past decades has revealed some rather strong
correlations between sentence word order and the order of words in other
constructions. In Table 50 I give Greenberg’s (1963) list, taken from Payne

Table 50 shows that Yurakaré has a slight tendency to correlate with the O‐V type.
Nevertheless, these correlations are not very convincing and can never be
evidence in themselves for a basic order.
  Generally, preverbal objects are pragmatically marked as well:(24) a      bëshë yurujare‐tu         bëshë     a‐mumuy bëshë         kamba‐tu         ma‐mmuy

            ‘All of that our chief Tiri transformed before.’ (both: OR‐19MA‐20)In (24), the narrator is telling about the mythological ancestor of the Yurakaré, Tiri,
who used his magic to transform into jungle animals all kinds of objects and
creatures that he encountered during his wandering, so that the Yurakaré would
have meat. In the second line, the object ati amumuy is preposed, because it is a
marked topic, with a deictic function, referring back to the topic of the previous
sentence.
  In the following fragment, the object is emphasized (stressed) and fronted in the
final sentence of the example:

      ‘Let’s make her chuchio, ehh jisopo and burn it first.’ (FL&DV‐14MA‐1)Generally, it seems that marked objects are found in initial position. Postverbal
objects can also refer to new and unpredictable information, but objects with extra
emphasis (focus), whether direct or applied, are found in preverbal position. The
fact that applied objects have a slight preference for being postverbal can be
explained by the fact that they are usually very topical (cf. Van Gijn 2005).
  The emphatic function of the preverbal position can also be seen in examples
such as the following, where the object NP is discontinuous (cf. section 4.1), the
modifier being in preverbal position, while the head noun is in postverbal
position:(26) lëshie=w ma‐bëjta‐y       shunñe=w
     two=PL      3PL‐see‐1SG.S man=PL
     ‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]This construction gives emphasis to the quantifier, while the head noun is
presented as a specification, or afterthought, possibly but not necessarily after a
pause. The quantifier is also stressed.
 Not very often both object and subject are overtly expressed. In the instances
where this was the case, I have encountered four word orders in texts:

be connected to the tendency in the Yurakaré main clause for the verb to be
preceded by only one constituent. In analyzing the first 85 clauses of a text, I have
encountered only three instances where the verb was not in second or first place in
the clause. All kinds of constituents can precede the verb. In (27)a two ideophonic
particles precede the verb; in (27)b and c, two elements precede the verb. Consider

           ‘They were standing there red (ripe).’ (AY‐3NC‐7)In almost all of the sentences that I examined in two texts, the verb was in either
initial or second position, preceded by all kinds of elements. In some instances, the
verb is in third place. This is also the case in the examples in (27)b and c. In these
circumstances, the first element is always a kind of setting marker, like latijsha
‘then’ pënchi ‘later’ ati ‘there’. These are elements that have a scope which is on the
level of the proposition. Subordinated clauses are also often in this position, often,
like setting words (adverbial elements setting the stage for a main event), marked
by an intonation break:(29) ati   shuju‐ø=ja an=chi woroj~wo‐ø=ya            latiji         ana a‐jorejto=chi

The clause
If these subordinated sentences are not at the beginning of a proposition, they are
at the very end:(30) kwarenta dia kwarenta noche mashi‐ø=ja tom               wita‐ø     ashaa=chi

     ‘After raining 40 days and 40 nights, the water level had reached the sky when it
     took Noah’s boat’ (OR‐20MA‐1)Subordinated clauses marked by the enclitics =ja (cf. 8.2.3) and =ti (8.2.4) have a
different internal word‐order, generally. Overtly expressed arguments mostly
precede the predicate in these types of clauses:(31) na     ishete buybu ka‐n‐dyuju‐ø=ti lash         achama      lëtta    dia nish

      wita‐ø=ya
      arrive.SG‐3=NVR
      ‘When the agouti told him the news, he did not come home for a day.’ (AR‐8MI‐49)Nevertheless, sometimes elements that belong to the subordinated clause can
appear to the right of the subordinating enclitic =ja (or =ti):(32) ku‐benemne‐ø              latiji          na   ta‐ppë           tiri bëjta‐ø=ja

     na      ishete     tejte
     DEM     agouti grandmother
     ‘Then Tiri felt sorry for the old agouti when he saw her.’ (AR‐8MI‐47)Leaving aside subordinated clauses, the data suggest that Yurakaré main clause
structure is V‐initial, with two positions before the verb, one position for setting
words, followed by an emphasis position, then followed by the verb. If we look at
how the elements after the verb are ordered, there is not a clear pattern, but
generally the most topical, known information is found rightmost. Adverbs and
adjuncts can intervene; adverbs related to the event are generally adjacent to the
verb, either to the left or to the right (cf. section 6.5.9 above). The following is a
continuous text fragment from the beginning of a text:

         ‘He carried with him a very small basket, this Pëpësu.’ (AY‐3NC‐6)Clause (33)a of the fragment is an existential‐presentative construction. The
subject, as expected, is in postverbal position. The adverb shinama generally
appears right after the verb. In (33)b the main new information in the form of an
adjunct is postverbal. The same adjunct in (33)c is the final element and old
information. The new information is the combination pëpëshamaw lacha, which
comes before the old information. In (33)d, the subordinate clause is preposed,
followed by a setting‐word latijsha and a preverbal subject with an extra emphasis
marker =ja introduces a new topic. In (33)e, finally, the emphasized element
anajalima is taken out of the object NP and positioned in the preverbal position.
The new object awerta comes right after the predicate, while the old information na
pëpësu is the final element. The template of the main clause, then, roughly looks as
in (34). Note that these are not absolute positions, but rather tendencies in the
clause.(34) (setting), emphasis, VP (pred. + adverbs), new information, topic, afterthought8.1.7 Negative and interrogative clauses
Negative clauses are marked by the negative adverb nish, with phonetic variant nij
(to negate a predicate or VP) or by the form nij‐ta (NEG‐MID; existential negation).
Nish/nij normally immediately precedes the predicate it negates:10Aysa and Pëpësu are two characters that are closely connected in this story in which they
work together. The reason the narrator started the story with Aysa is probably because I
asked him to tell the story of Aysa.","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301]"

The prefix l‐ also occurs with ana and the locative marker =y to form the deictic lani
‘right here’, which is usually more restricted than ani ‘here’:(116) a   l‐ani            mu‐tütü‐n‐tu

The form anama means ‘be/do like this’ and the form anu(ta) means ‘like this’; likewise,
achama means ‘be/do like that’, achu(ta) means ‘like that’. Although there are some
formal idiosyncrasies (e.g. ti of ati changing into cha in achama, and the u in both anu(ta)
and achu(ta)), the basic forms and there derivations still seem quite clearly related,
especially since the derived forms can also be prefixed with l‐ and bë‐.
  Demonstratives can be marked with local postpositions =y ‘locative’, =chi ‘direction’,
=jsha ‘ablative’, and =la ‘path/instrument’. Some of these combinations seem to be
lexicalized:

naa seems to retain its purely deictic function, but ati has a discourse deictic function,
referring to preceding or following discourse stretches or participants, as can be seen in
(114) and (115) above. The pronoun ana can have several functions within a narrative:(119) a   latijsha ma‐dula‐jti‐ø=w         ana     isopo                       (recognitional)

          ‘What thing killed these birds for you?’ (FA‐6MA‐7)In (119)a, isopo is mentioned for the first time. This may be an instance of recognitional
use (cf. Himmelmann 1996:230‐239, Diessel 1999:105‐109), where the speaker activates
specific shared knowledge. An important characteristic of recognitionally used
demonstratives is that they can identify not previously introduced participants. The
speaker here apparently assumes that the hearer knows what isopo is. Ana can also be
used to mark topical discourse referents in some circumstances. In (119)b, tappëshamaw
has been the topic of the previous discourse, here it is used anaphorically. The
difference with discourse‐deictic ati is not entirely clear; it seems that ana is often used
when making a general concluding remark about some participant. In (119)c, finally,
ana simply has its spatial deictic use, referring to an element in the deictic space of the
situation within the narrative.","[144, 145, 146]"

8.1.5 Ditransitive verbs
Ditransitive verbs are of two types: extended transitives (17)a, and doubly
extended intransitives, (17)b:
                                         276

             1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG=IGN      3SG.CO‐say‐3=NVR
             ‘“Go and get them for me!”, she said to him.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)In (17)a, the verb che ‘eat’ has a basic valence of two (i.e. a subject and a direct
object, and to this is added a third, applied argument, an affected object (cf. section
5.2.4). In (17)b, the verb mala ‘go’, is a one‐place verb. In (17)b, there is also an
indirect object and a purposive object (cf. section 5.2.5), extending the valency to
three.
  Ditransitives do not occur frequently in texts. They constitute only about 4.2% of
all predicates. Almost all instances I encountered in the texts were combinations of
a direct object with an applied object (89%). The subjects of these verbs are overtly
expressed in 82.3% of all cases. This is roughly equivalent with subjects of
transitive and extended intransitive verbs. In Table 45 above I collapsed the group
of applied objects and direct objects. If we look at their behavior separately in
ditransitives, we get the following picture:          Table 48 - Direct objects (O) and applied objects (E) in ditransitive verbs
                     %OV %VO %Vo %EV %VE %Ve

are comparable to O‐drop in transitive predicates and E ‐drop in extended
intransitive predicates:     Table 49 - Comparing direct object and applied object across multivalent verbs

for ditransitives). The same holds for the dropping of applied objects: 82.7% in the
case of extended intransitives, 89.1% in the case of ditransitives. It seems that the
role of direct objects does not differ in ditransitive and transitive verbs, nor does
7To be able to compare like with like, I have disregarded instances of doubly extended
intransitives, i.e. a one place predicate with two applied objects. In practice this appeared
to be only a small number; by far most instances were combinations of a direct object and
an indirect object.","[291, 292]"

where a sound‐symbolic representation of the action is imaginable, like assa‐ta
‘grindstone’ (‘“assa” it says’), ñuñu‐ta ‘nipple’ (‘“ñuñu”, it says’ while being sucked). It
might be that the middle marker has spread through the language in this fashion.
Further research is needed before we can say anything definite about it, however.
  The metaphorical extension‐reading is less clearly related to the ideophone
construction or any of the semantic fields associated with the middle. Possibly these
instances derive from another function of the verb ta:(90) i‐wishwi ushta       na     ishete      layshu‐shku‐ta
     VBL‐tail‐3 before    DEM agouti         squirrel‐ADV.CMP‐MID
     ‘The agouti used to have a tail, like a squirrel.’ (AR‐8MI‐44)In (90)a, the noun layshu ‘squirrel’ carries the suffix combination ‐shku‐ta. In this
grammaticalized suffix, three components can be recognized. There is an
adverbializing suffix ‐sh, used to derive manner adverbs from adjectives, then there is
the combination ku‐ta, also found with the meaning ‘say to him’, where ku‐ is the third
person singular cooperative object, and ta is the verb ‘to say’. If this is indeed the
diachronic source for the suffix combination ‐shku‐ta, the suffix boundaries are
reanalyzed: the marker ‐ta can be left out, but ‐shku seems to be an indivisible whole
that can be used to derive adverbs from nouns (and verbs). Semantically, the relation
with ta is not so clear: ‐shku‐ta says ‘it behaves/looks like an X, but it is not’.
Nevertheless, the semantic relation with the metaphorical extension use is imaginable.
  Furthermore, there is evidence that some of the metaphorical extension uses might
derive from the middle use after all:(91) a    bana‐ta     ‘stretch oneself’   bana~ba     ‘stretch something’
     b    sama‐ta     ‘splash oneself’    sama‐che    ‘splash someone’The form bana‐ta, as we have seen in (87) above also means ‘twig’, banna means ‘arm’,
sama‐ta means ‘juice of a fruit’, samma means ‘water’. It might be that these
metaphorically extended nouns are actually descriptions of behavioral or physical
characteristics of the entities involved.
  In conclusion: how exactly the metaphorical extension is linked to the middle marker
is unclear. I have made some suggestions, but further research is needed.
  A final remark to be made about the middle marker ‐tA is that roots marked with this
marker are completely flexible as to the word class they fall into: they can be used as
nouns, (92)a, predicates, (92)b, adjectives, (92)c, or adverbs, (92)d:

predicate, evidenced by the fact that it carries the non‐veridical marker, which only
attaches to predicates. In (92)c, tüm‐ta functions as an adjective, since it is marked for
collective, which is restricted to adjectives. In (92)d, finally, bachaj‐ta functions as a
manner adverb, modifying its head kambushuti.","[191, 192, 193]"
"
8.1.3 Transitive verbs
As far as subjects of the transitive verb (A) are concerned, we see that they are left
unexpressed much more often than intransitive subjects (S), cf. 8.1.1 above. The
fact that overtly expressed noun phrases appear more freely in intransitive subject
or direct object roles (O) than in transitive subject role is a universal tendency,
which “is evidenced widely in the spontaneous discourse of virtually all
languages investigated to date” (Du Bois 2003:48). This phenomenon has to do
with the fact that new information is typically expressed in either intransitive
subject or transitive object role, positions more salient than the transitive subject
position.
  As far as the position of overtly expressed subjects is concerned, there is a slight
tendency for A to favor the postverbal position. Nevertheless, this preference is
much weaker than in intransitive verbs, where 85.3% of all overtly expressed S‐
arguments is realized in post‐verbal position, whereas only 55.8% of all overt A‐
arguments of inherently transitive verbs is expressed post‐verbally. This
difference can possibly be attributed to the emphatic function of the preverbal
position, as will be discussed in section 8.1.6.
  The percentage of direct objects left unexpressed (58.4%) is comparable to the
percentage of non‐expressed S‐arguments (62.5%) in intransitives. This fact seems
to support the claim that, as far as information‐structure goes, the S‐position and
the O‐position have similar functions: they are equally equipped for introducing
new linguistic material.
  The position of overt O’s is rather unpredictable, in the sense that there does not
seem to be a clear preference for either preverbal or postverbal O’s. I will discuss
this matter in section 8.1.6.",[290]

not have a controlling agent. Moreover, the event of seeing can be, and often is
punctual. It is not absolutely clear why (14)b should be ungrammatical, but it might
have to do with a natural endpoint for the verb danda ‘to go up’, which is moslty used
for describing someone climbing a tree, where the top is the natural endpoint.
Nevertheless, a situation like the one in (14)b is perfectly imaginable, and it is not
entirely clear why this should be ungrammatical.
  The following causatives can be marked for cooperative object:(15) a   ku‐bache‐ø
         3SG.CO‐leave.CAU‐3
         ‘He sent him as well, made him go with another.’ [DV‐12MA‐25]
     b   ku‐wiliche‐ø
         3SG.CO‐return.CAU‐3
         ‘He sends him back with him.’ [FP‐14MA‐20]The difference between (14) and the examples in (15) is that in the latter examples, the
underlying predicate of effect has a controlling agent, and is a more prototypical
example of an activity.
  Another case – like the causative examples – where the coordination concerns the
direct object rather than the subject is the following:(16) ku‐bëjta‐y
     3SG.CO‐see‐1SG.S
     ‘I see him with what he has.’ [DV‐12MA‐25]The example in (16) is of a unique type. It represents an exception to the tendency
stated above that verbs should be prototypical activities. Notionally, the cooperative
object is rather deviant as well, it does not conform to the prototype interpretation of
cooperative object.
  Spanish verbs that have been adapted to the system of Yurakaré can sometimes also
get the cooperative object application:(17) a   të‐lee‐m
         1SG.CO‐read‐2SG
         ‘You help me read, you are co‐reading.’ [MH‐13MA‐2]
     b   ku‐yuda‐shta‐ø
         3SG.CO‐help‐FUT‐3
         ‘He will help him.’ (OR‐20MA‐1)There are some verbs where the roles of the subject and the cooperative object are not
the same, or even alike:

          3SG.CO‐ask‐HAB‐3=PL=NVR
          ‘They used to ask him.’ (AR‐8MI‐77)
     c    të‐dyojlo‐m
          1SG.CO‐scold‐2SG.S
          ‘You are angry with me.’Even though the participants do not have the same role, they do have a complementary
role, and one can say that the event expressed by the predicate is a joint effort in a way
of the subject and the cooperative object. The verb ta with the cooperative object
prefixes can be contrasted with the same verb without these prefixes:(19) arey   arey    ululche=w ti‐tiya‐ø=w=la         ta‐ø=ya     na     ta‐ppë       tiri
     ayay ayay bee=PL            1SG‐eat‐3=PL=VAL say‐3=NVR DEM 1PL‐grandfather Tiri
     ‘“Ayay! Ayay! The bees are eating me!”, our grandfather Tiri said.’ (AR‐8MI‐52)In (19), the speaker does not share his information with anyone, it is an expressive
statement. As soon as the speaker is speaking with someone, the cooperative object
prefixes appear. In that sense we are dealing with a joint effort. The same can be said
for ite ‘ask’. However, as we will see in section (5.2.3), addressees are generally
encoded as indirect objects in Yurakaré. The predicate dyojlo is much harder to analyze
in this way. I have no clear explanation for this at this point.
  In conclusion, even though the term ‘cooperative object’ does not fit neatly to all
instances, I still consider it to be the core notion of which the other uses are somehow
derived. It may be that further research will lead to a higher level of abstraction that
will better fit all uses.","[166, 167, 168]"

2.4.2 Stress‐attracting prefixes
A number of prefixes or clusters of prefixes in Yurakaré sometimes attract stress,
even if this goes counter foot structure discussed in 2.4.1. Consider the following
examples:(52) a    ti‐síbë         ‘my house’
          mi‐síbë         ‘your (sg) house’
          a‐síbë          ‘his/her house’
      b   tá‐sibë         ‘our house’
          pá‐sibë         ‘your (pl) house’
          má‐sibë         ‘their house’In the examples of (52)a, stress placement is as one would expect: an iambic foot
structure, built from the left and the main stress on the rightmost (in this case:
only) dominant foot node. In the b‐examples, however, there is a deviant stress
12Final syllables can be stressed for discourse related reasons, cf. section 2.4.7, and in
ideophones, cf. section 6.6.2.",[53]

4.5.1 Qualifying adjectives
Qualifying adjectives can occur in attributive position, but are mostly used as
predicates, relatively loose from the noun they modify. Adjectives are found in
minimally the following semantic domains (cf. Dixon’s 1977 seven universal
categories):               Table 29 ‐ The seven universal adjective categories in Yurakaré
                    semantic field        examples
                    dimension             matata ‘big’, ñuñujulë ‘small’
                    physical property     sëpisë ‘hard’, tarattara ‘dirty’
                    color                 sëjsëshi ‘blue’, tëbëttëbë ‘red’
                    human propensity      meyeye ‘naughty’, ayra ‘lazy’
                    age                   oshpe ‘young, new’, pëpë ‘old’
                    value                 ënnëtë ‘bad’ shudyulë ‘beautiful’
                    speed                 adyajta ‘fast’, kamishë ‘slow’
The category of qualifying adjectives is not very well defined in Yurakaré. Probably a
separate category, or the expansion of this category, was a relatively recent innovation
in the language, possibly under the influence of Spanish. An argument for this is that
many adjectives are, or seem to be, derived. This has been discussed in section 3.2.3
above.",[149]

4.     The Noun PhraseNominal morphology and syntax can be best understood by studying the Noun Phrase
(NP) as a whole. Some morphological categories concern the entire NP rather than just
one of its parts, and other operations (e.g. modifier floating) can only be understood
with reference to the NP as a whole. I will first give a general overview of the NP in
Yurakaré (4.1), then continue to describe the number enclitic =w (4.2) and
postpositional clitics (4.3). In 4.4 I will discuss the head of the NP, the noun; in 4.5 I will
discuss adjectives, including quantifiers, numerals and adjectivally used
demonstratives.","[104, 105, 106]"

Morphology
3.2.4 Compounding
Morphological compounding mainly occurs in the nominal domain in Yurakaré.
Nominal compounding follows essentially the same rules as affixation in terms of
prosody (cf. section 2.4). There are endocentric and exocentric compounds.
Examples of the former type are the following:(34) a   waja‐pëlë
         cow‐skin
         ‘cowhide’
     b   talipa‐newe
         chicken‐excrement
         ‘chicken‐dirt’The head noun in these compounds is always to the right. Stress follows the
normal prosodic rules. In (34)a, the stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable,
since that is the rightmost dominant node. In (34)b, the stress also falls on the
antepenultimate syllable, since the initial syllable of talipa is strong (in isolation it
carries primary stress: tálipa), and feet are counted from there onwards. Sometimes
vowels of the head noun are elided, just as can happen with ordinary suffixes:(35) tanti‐plë          (tanti+pëlë ‘eye+skin’)
     eye‐skin/mouth
     ‘eyelid’Endocentric noun‐noun compounds without any possessive relation between
them are rather marginal, and these are always person descriptions:(36) a   sewe‐bonto
         child‐son
         ‘young man’
     b   sewe‐shoja
         child‐daughter
         ‘young woman’
     c   wësh‐shunye
         in.law‐man
         ‘father‐in‐law’
     d   wësh‐shendye
         in.law‐young.woman
         ‘mother‐in‐law’Exocentric compounds are more complex both morphologically and semantically.
They are contractions of syntactic phrases and have unpredictable meanings:

A grammar of Yurakaré
(37) a   pata‐n‐sibë
         thorn‐EXC‐house
         ‘thorn‐houser’ (birds that make their nests out of thorns)
     b   tëbë‐n‐este
         blood‐EXC‐drink(N)
         ‘blood‐drinker’ (referring to blood‐drinking bats)Animals are often described in this way. The meaning of such a compound refers
to a characteristic of some entity. The connection marker ‐n‐ comes from the
proclitic article an (cf. sections 3.2.5 and 3.3.1), a short form of the demonstrative
pronoun ana ‘this’.(38) a   patta an    sibbë
         thorn DEM house
         ‘The house is thorny.’
     b   tëbbë an    este
         blood DEM drink
         ‘The drink is blood.’This structure is still reflected in the prosodic structure:(39) a   pàtansíbë
     b   të́bënésteAccording to normal prosodic rules (iambic feet from left to right and avoidance
of stressing the final syllable), primary stress would fall on the penultimate
syllable and there would be no secondary stress. Still, these compounds can no
longer be regarded as a syntactic phrase, since there is only one primary stress,
and also because the gemination of the nouns is lost.
  Semantically, these exocentric compounds refer to some object or concept (right‐
hand member), over which something is predicated (the predicate is the left‐hand
member). This object or concept is connected in some unspecified way to the
entity the compound as a whole refers to. Something is predicated over this noun.
  Compounds in which the verb is the right‐hand member are restricted to some
lexicalizations, all involving the verb ta ‘say’:(40) a   puchik mala‐ø manka
         splash go‐3        mango
         ‘“Splash”, the mango went.’ [MH‐33MA‐7]
     b   puchijta‐ø    manka (puchik + ta)
         ‘The mango is/got squashed.’ [MH‐33MA‐7]
                                            60
Morphology
In Yurakaré there are many ideophones such as puchik, which are often sound‐
symbolic expressions of an event. These ideophones can be combined with a verb.
This can in principle be any verb, but the verbs ta ‘say’ and mala/bali go.sg/pl
function as semantically empty verbs. The verb ta can be compounded with the
ideophone to form a middle event. The fact that we are dealing with a compound
in (40)b is evidenced by the fact that the plosive /k/ lenites to /h/, spelled j. The
compounded ta is grammaticalized, and can best be interpreted as a middle
marker (cf. section 5.3.1).","[73, 74, 75, 76]"
