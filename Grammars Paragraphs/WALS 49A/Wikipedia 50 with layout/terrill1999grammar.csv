"This is exactly the direction of split noted by Silverstein (1976) (see also Dixon (1994:
84)), who suggests that if there is a split in a marking system based on the nature of
different types of NPs, 1st and 2nd person pronouns are more likely to be marked by a
nominative/accusative system than 3rd person pronouns, which in turn are more likely
to be marked by an ergative/absolutive system. SilversteinÕs (and DixonÕs) discussion is
actually about case-marking systems, but presumably the same principles hold for
pronominal prefixing systems.",[412]
"There are no third person pronouns in Lavukaleve, although foia and oia are possible
candidates. Himmelmann (1996: 211-215) provides a methodology for distinguishing
third person pronouns from demonstratives, but even he admits that it is difficult to
apply, and certainly my data does not contain such examples as would be necessary for
a rigorous distinction to be made. Foia and oia are considered demonstrative pronouns
here rather than personal pronouns largely because they are marked for degrees of
distance (even though only marginally in the case of oia). The grammatical category of
distance is more usually associated with demonstratives than with personal pronouns.",[204]
"S UBJECTSIn almost every area of Lavukaleve, A and S pattern the same way in morphological
terms, and O patterns differently. Thus, on the basis of certain morphological tests, a
grammatical relation of Subject can be set up. None of Lavukaleve syntax is based on
constructions which require a pivot. Conjoined clauses of the sort Ôthe man hit the
woman and ran awayÕ (to use a time-honoured example) are expressed by clauses joined
in either subordinate-dependent or coordinate-dependent structures; in either case,
arguments tend not to be shared at the morpho-syntactic level, or at least, to not be
necessarily shared. That is, one could say Ôhim hitting the woman, the man went awayÕ;
Ôhim hitting the woman, she went awayÕ; Ôhim coming, he hit the womanÕ; Ôhim
coming, the woman hit himÕ and so on. In all cases, arguments are expressed by
pronominal affixes, except where this is precluded by combinatorial restrictions on
affixes. However, throughout most of its morphology, Lavukaleve is a
nominative/accusative language. The only area of exception is in adverbial subordinate
clauses, which show a split-ergative pattern, in which 1st and 2nd person subjects
follow a nominative/accusative marking system and 3rd person subjects follow an
ergative/absolutive marking system: see Section 16.1.",[234]
"Nouns are divided into three genders. This is a feature common in languages of the East
Papuan Phylum, and rare in Oceanic languages. Gender in Lavukaleve is marked in
agreement forms on all noun modifiers, and on verbs through participant marking
prefixes and suffixes. Gender distinctions are maintained in singular and dual forms
throughout all areas of the language, but are collapsed in the plural. Nouns are overtly
marked for number, and the methods of marking number are highly complex and
irregular. There are up to 80 different ways of creating dual and plural forms of nouns.
Plural formation depends largely on phonological and semantic criteria, and also bears
some relationship to gender. Dual formation operates on different principles, largely
depending on the phonological shape of the singular noun. There is case marking for
three spatial/relational cases, but these have a low functional load. Possession is marked
by a prefix on the possessed noun. Types of possession are undifferentiated, as in most
Papuan languages, as opposed to Oceanic languages, in which possession is frequently a
very complex area. In Oceanic languages, possessive affixes are frequently the same as
object affixes; in Lavukaleve, all but one are identical to subject affixes. Like in most
Papuan languages, but unlike in Oceanic languages, all modifiers follow their head
noun.",[38]
"In English, sentence focus is marked formally by a prosodic accent on the subject NP.
This marking type, they say, comes about through paradigmatic opposition to predicate
focus marking in English, in which the prosodic accent is on the object: Òthe position of
the accent on the subject noun in the [sentence focus] construction is the result purely of a
formal requirement: the need to indicate a paradigmatic contrastÓ (p. 195). They present a
typology of formal marking of sentence focus, as opposed to predicate focus: sentence
focus marking in a given language may involve prosodic inversion, that is, giving the
sentence focus subject the prosodic accent usually associated with an object (or predicate);
changes to linear order; making the subject a single constituent within the predicate
(syntactic inversion); making the subject a non-topic; giving it non-nominative case
marking; or giving the verb impersonal agreement. Lavukaleve does not fit with any of
these formal marking strategies, but even though the material it uses to mark sentence
focus versus predicate focus is not covered in Lambrecht and PolinskyÕs typology, the
system it uses to mark the opposition between sentence focus and predicate focus is
exactly parallel to those used in many other languages.",[308]
"
HOMONYMSHomonyms provide evidence that while phonological criteria are important, they are not
the only means by which the dual or plural form of a noun is determined. In some cases,
two homonyms have the same dual and/or plural form; in other cases, they are different.",[143]
"Schachter (1973) suggests that there is a semantic link between focus constructions and
relative clauses, involving foregrounding:
       ...just as the focus construction reflects the assignment of special communicative
       prominence to one part of an underlying sentence, so, I would suggest, does the relative
       construction. In the case of the focus construction, greater prominence is assigned to
       that part of the underlying sentence which is identified as relatively new information in
       the resultant construction, i.e. the focused constituent. In the case of the relative
       construction, greater prominence is assigned to that part of the underlying sentence
       which determines the function of the resultant construction, i.e. the head noun. While
       the basis for the foregrounding is quite different in the two cases, the foregrounding
       itself Ð the divisions of a sentence into a more prominent part and a less prominent part
       Ð is essentially the same. (Schachter 1973: 44)This approach shows a possible functional account of the use of the Agreement Suffix
in both relative clauses and focus constructions in Lavukaleve. There is also a common
functional link between relative clauses and adjectives in that both relative clauses and
adjectives function to modify nouns (Schachter also makes this link overt (1973: 42-
43)).",[271]

                            2 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYWords can be defined on phonological grounds. One can pause between, but not within,
a word; this is AndersonÕs (1985: 151) idea of Òpotential pause locationsÓ. On another
level, words have psychological reality; speakers can pronounce them in isolation and
talk about them. Units smaller than a word, however, cannot be easily pronounced or
talked about in isolation. Grammatical words are made up of stems plus, in some cases,
affixes. Phonological words are in almost all cases coextensive with grammatical
words; there are is only one case in which a phonological word is different from a
grammatical word. This is verb compounds. In verb compounds (see Section 14.2) one
grammatical word is made up of two phonological words, each with its own stress. In
all other cases, phonological words are the same as grammatical words.","[64, 65]"

18.2 REFERENCE TRACKINGThere is an array of morphological material available for marking referents in a discourse:
overt NPs can be used, and there are various types of verbal participant-marking affixes
depending on the predicate type. There is also the gender system, by means of which
participants can be differentiated by agreement on verbs and nominal modifiers. Also
important are the demonstrative pronouns, one of which is used to refer to activated
referents, and the other to refer to semi-activated referents, that is, referents which have
been mentioned before but are not the last referent to have been mentioned. In addition,
the focus marking system as a method of making reference to a participant, and at the
same time marking its role in the information structure of the sentence, is pervasive.
These phenomena have all been described at length in previous chapters. The purpose of
this section is to show how the interaction of all this linguistic material operates in texts to
refer to and, if necessary, disambiguate participants. It also aims to show that, even
though this material does exist and can be used for this purpose, very often
disambiguation of participants is not a priority, and in fact, in many cases, identity of
participants is understood through extra-linguistic rather than linguistic means.","[456, 457]"
"Lavukaleve has no case marking for core argument roles, but its pronominal verb
prefixes are marked for grammatical relations. Compare the following:5)     Ali         na         okiu.
       ali         na         o-      kiu
       man(m)      sgmArt     3sgS-   die
       The man died.",[234]
"All nouns have an inherent gender, but this gender is in most cases not marked overtly
on nouns (although see Section 5.6 on the relationship between gender and plural
formation of nouns). All modifiers in an NP, except for possessors (and a few other
minor lexically-determined exceptions), agree in gender with the head noun. That is,
gender is marked on adjectives, demonstratives, and the definite article. In addition,
most clausal elements which cross-reference to a nominal argument are also marked for
the gender of their nominal argument. So object prefixes, the Agreement Suffix, and the
focus markers are also marked for the gender of the noun to which they refer. Thus
gender is a pervasive feature of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax.",[147]
"
2.10 ALTERNATIVE REALISATIONSThere are some examples of alternative pronunciations of certain words. These
alternative realisations all involve interchange between different phonemes of the
language. That is, the alternations neutralise the distinction between otherwise
independent phonemes. However, being lexically constrained, and also being optional,
it is never the case that ambiguity arises through the neutralisation of these phonemes in
the words in which it occurs. In each case, I have written the words in question with
their most common pronunciation. The words are:/d/~ /r/    ria            ['dia] ~ ['ria]                   Ôwhere to?Õ
            roi            ['doi] ~ ['roi]                   Ôwhere?Õ
            raine          ['daine] ~ ['raine]               ÔtomorrowÕNote that the /d/ ~ /r/ alternation only occurs in the words initial position. The word
raine also occurs in the word iruraine ÔdailyÕ. In this case the pronunciation can only
be:            iruraine       ['iru'raine]                      ÔdailyÕ
/b/ ~ /v/   beko           ['beko] ~ [ºeko]                  ÔstoneÕ
            vuli           ['buli] ~ ['ºuli]                 ÔbehindÕ/n/ ~ /l/   mulukuita       ['munu'kuita] ~ ['mulu'kuita]    ÔmosquitoÕ
            halangas       ['hana'÷as] ~ ['hala'÷as]         ÔcoralÕThese alternations are all a generationally-based phenomenon. Younger people, in their
twenties or younger, tend to pronounce /d/, /b/ and /n/ in certain words where older
people consistently pronounce /r/, /v/ and /l/ respectively. This is not a universal
generational sound change, but rather is lexically constrained.",[64]

use the following terminology to refer to different types of nouns or parts of nouns. I
will say that every noun is a lexical root. This lexical root may have one or two stems:
the citation stem, and the locative stem. The lexical root is in almost all instances
formally identical to the citation stem (see Section 5.6 for an instance of where this is
not the case).",[116]

RO ÔONEÕThere is an indefinite adjective ro ÔoneÕ. It also has a special use, not as a modifier but

"There is a third major problem, related to the same issue of the morphological material
available to mark arguments. Although one could think of the verbal and Habitual
Auxiliary prefixes as arguments (in that they mark person, gender, number and
grammatical function), and possibly one could think of the Present Tense suffixes
(which mark Present Tense, and number of the subject) and Imperative suffixes (which
mark one of two types of Imperative mood, and number of the subject) in the same way,
it is much harder to think of members of the Agreement Suffix paradigm as arguments.
The Agreement Suffix forms only mark gender and number, and make no reference to
other important categories of referents, such as person or grammatical function. The
case for the core argument status of the Agreement Suffix would be very hard to
sustain.",[240]
"
8.5.1 THE DISTANCE PARAMETERAs with the demonstrative pronoun foia, there are four distinctions made in the hoia
forms; three degrees of distance, and a further distinction in the distal term between
specified and unspecified location. In Lavukaleve, as is the case in many other
languages, the distance parameter in these deictics is also used anaphorically in texts, to
distinguish between referents closer and further away in terms of the apparent viewpoint
of the speaker in the story. Only the proximal ho ÔthisÕ and medial hoia ÔthatÕ can be
used for referring to established referents in a discourse; that is, tracking and
recognitional uses.",[191]
"Stress shift rules such as those described above can be utilised; if it is possible to put the

"Further, the use of the Agreement Suffix on relative clauses and adjectives can be
related to its use on stative/resultative predicates. This relationship does not lie in the
concept of foregrounding; in fact Hopper and Thompson (1980, especially p. 285) show
that stative clauses tend to be backgrounded, not foregrounded. Rather, the relationship
lies more in the functional and in some cases formal overlap between adjectives and

"Firstly, dependent structures in Papuan languages are typically used to carry the event line
of the narrative forward. Anything which carries the event line forward is new,
newsworthy, rather than presupposed information. This is the case, for example, in
examples (59) and (60).",[296]
"Like many Papuan languages, one of the methods Lavukaleve uses to combine
predicates is clause chaining. There are three verbal suffixes used in clause chains,
which indicate the temporal relationship of the chained clause to the following clause.
However, unusually for a language which has clause chaining, there is no switch-
reference marking, and indeed there are no restrictions on argument sharing between
chained clauses. Subordination is also a very frequent method of clause combining, and
there are a few different semantic types of subordinate clauses. While in almost all areas
of its morpho-syntax Lavukaleve is a nominative/accusative language, adverbial
subordinate clauses involve a split-ergative marking system in which first and second
person subjects follow a nominative/accusative participant marking system whereas
third person subjects follow an ergative/absolutive marking system. Relative clauses are
internally-headed; their heads are syntactically part of the relative clause, not the main
clause.",[39]
"The semantics of LavukaleveÕs system of participant marking of intransitive predicates
are similar to the semantics of active/agentive participant marking systems described by
Mithun (1991). In Guaran’, Lakhota, Central Pomo, Caddo and Mohawk the subjects of
intransitive verbs are marked either in the same way as transitive subjects or in the same

as an active/agentive alignment system. However even though semantically the use of
the prefix versus the Agreement Suffix in LavukaleveÕs independent non-focus
intransitive predicates is similar to the active/agentive participant marking systems
described by Mithun, formally the system in Lavukaleve is not an alignment system; it
is not the case that there are two kinds of intransitive subjects, one marked like objects,
one marked like transitive subjects, as in MithunÕs languages. Rather, there are two
participant marking systems available: one uses the same system as used by transitive
verbs; one uses the system used in focus marking, in marking the heads of relative
clauses, and in marking adjectives to agree with their head nouns. The choice between
the systems in intransitive predicates is based on a semantic distinction between
stative/resultative and active clauses.","[270, 271]"
"There are three genders in Lavukaleve: masculine, feminine and neuter, named for the
fact that in the masculine class belong (among other things) most nouns referring to
male people, in the feminine class belong (among other things) all nouns referring to
female people, and in the neuter class belong very few nouns referring to humans.
Nouns have a fixed gender, which controls agreement with its modifiers, and
throughout the clause. Note that there are a few nouns which are always plural. Because
plural nouns do not have gender, this means that, strictly speaking, there are some nouns
which do not have inherent gender. Such nouns are considered a special case of
common nouns; the phenomenon is more to do with morphological exigencies of
Lavukaleve than with the syntactic distribution of such words. The principles associated
with gender assignment are discussed in Chapter 6.",[69]

markers, postpositions, conjunctions, the Habitual Auxiliary, locationals, demonstrative

languages. It is marked for gender and number, and is the final member of a noun
phrase. Many of the Oceanic languages of the Solomon Islands have definite articles,
but they precede, rather than follow, their noun.","[37, 38]"
"The Presentative suffix -ri derives a presentative form of a deictic, something like the
French voilˆ. Presentatives also occur in languages closer to the Solomons, for example
in Maybrat, a West Papuan Phylum language (Dol 1998). Presentatives are described by
Anderson and Keenan as demonstratives Òwhich are used to indicate an itemÕs location
or to signal its appearance in (or relative to) the observational field of the Sp[eaker]Ó                                                     188

what is here described as a presentative demonstrative:
        A Sentential Demonstrative ... is a demonstrative that can stand alone as a sentence,
        having what can be called a Presentative function. These are sentences whose meanings
        are something like ÔBehold!Õ or maybe ÔLook at this!Õ. Latin ecce, French voilˆ, Serbo-
        Croatian evo, are examples of Sentential Demonstratives. Often a noun or pronoun
        indicating the object being presented occurs in construction with a Sentential
        Demonstrative, as in French Le voilˆ, Serbo-Croatian Evo ga, both meaning ÔHere he
        isÕ. (1982: 47)This is the most common pragmatic function of LavukaleveÕs Presentative suffix 4.
There are a couple of other related functions associated with this suffix. If a deictic is
used on its own as a single-word utterance, as, for instance, the answer to a question
where? or how?, it must appear with the Presentative suffix. For example, in showing
someone how to do something, an action will be accompanied by the single-word
utterance:87)     Akari!
        aka    -ri
        then5  -PSNV

"
4.1 THE STRUCTURE OF NPSAn NP consists of a head, and, if this is a noun, it may be followed by optional
modifiers including adjectives. The Specifier adjective mea and the adjective ro ÔoneÕ
follow other adjectives and the final slot of the NP is filled, optionally, by the definite
article or a demonstrative modifier. If the head is a demonstrative or personal pronoun,
the only modification it can have is a demonstrative modifier. This word order is
obligatory. The only modifiers which can precede a nominal head are possessors, but
these occur in their own NP preceding the NP of the head noun.",[95]

CHAPTER THREE
Word classesWord classes are recognised on the grounds of morphological possibilities and syntactic
distribution, combined with, in some cases, semantics. There are two large open word
classes in Lavukaleve: nouns and verbs. There are also a large number of medium-sized
to small closed classes. This chapter contains a justification of the classification of these
word classes. More details on each of them are found elsewhere in the thesis. However
some of the smaller classes which are not discussed elsewhere in the thesis are
described more fully in this chapter. Thus there is a description of the counting system,
and of some of the more commonly occurring particles.","[66, 67]"
"If a speaker does not know the gender of a referent, they can either avoid agreement, or,
they can use question words like man ÔwhatÕ; ami ÔwhoÕ and elahave Ôhow muchÕ, in
which case gender is syntactically assigned, because these question words are masculine
nouns. Thus:19)     Man           hin?
        man           hin
        what(m)       3sgnEFOC

"
8.4.3 A GRAMMATICALISED USE OF FOIGABy far the most common foia demonstrative pronoun form, simply in terms of
frequency in texts, is the singular neuter form foiga. In the majority of cases, the
antecedent of foiga is not an entity but an entire proposition. This use of foiga often
occurs between two clauses to link the clauses in a temporal sequence (something like
English ÔthenÕ, Ôafter thatÕ, or, more colloquially, ÔokayÕ); this is a discourse deixis
function. In this function it is not an argument of a predicate, but rather an adjunct.
Some examples of this use of foiga:14)    Mavai                         foiga      oinala                    foa     fufumal.

THE PRESENTATIVE SUFFIX WITH HOKA /HOIKA/HEAKA ÔHERE /THERE/THERE FARÕThe meaning of -ri with hoka/hoika/heaka is very difficult to discern. In many cases,
-ri forms seem to mean very much the same as non-ri forms.",[218]
"
3.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNSThere are first and second person pronouns in Lavukaleve, but no third person pronoun.
The functional domain of third person pronouns is filled by demonstrative pronouns
instead. Argumentation for this division of the deictic paradigms is presented in full in
Chapter 8, where also the paradigm of 1st and 2nd person pronouns is given.
Defining features of personal pronouns are:·   they mark person and number of the referent, and inclusion/exclusion of the
    addressee (only in 1st person non-singular forms)
·   they function as nominal heads
·   they cannot be modified by adjectives, though they can be modified by the
    demonstrative modifier
·   they take the Group suffixes -ha/-saIt is perhaps worth noting here that there are no indefinite pronouns in Lavukaleve.
Concepts like someone/anyone are expressed using the noun ali ÔmanÕ; no-one is
expressed by the NP malav rovo-ru Ôpeople one.pl-NEG (no people)Õ or ali roa-ru
Ôman one.sgm-NEG (no man)Õ. Concepts like something/anything are expressed by the
noun mina ÔthingÕ; nothing by mina ro-ru Ôthing one.sgf-NEG (not a thing)Õ. Man
ÔwhatÕ, ami ÔwhoÕ, and elahave Ôhow muchÕ, all masculine nouns, can also mean
ÔwhateverÕ, ÔwhoeverÕ and Ôhowever muchÕ respectively. Plural noun elav Ôhow manyÕ
can also mean Ôhowever manyÕ. Roi~doi ÔwhichÕ can also mean ÔwhicheverÕ. Concepts
like somewhere/anywhere/nowhere, somehow/anyhow and so on are expressed as Ôin a
placeÕ, Ôin no placeÕ, Ôin a wayÕ and so on in Lavukaleve. There are no special
expressions for these concepts.",[81]

THE HYBRID NOUN RUIMA ÔOLD MANÕCorbett (1991: 183 ff.) defines hybrid nouns as those nouns which Òneither simply take
the agreement of one consistent agreement pattern nor belong to two or more gendersÓ.
There is one word in Lavukaleve like this: ruima Ôold manÕ. All nouns referring to
human males are masculine in gender, except for ruima. This word always takes a
feminine, not masculine, definite article:6)     ruima         la               * ruima na
       ruima         la                 ruima na

                                       6 - GENDER AND AGREEMENTBut it takes either masculine or feminine agreement in other word classes. Typically it
takes masculine pronouns and demonstratives, and feminine adjectives and verbal
agreement:7)     ""Vasiam                          oina                   ruima      la?""

Often, though, speakers hesitate over which agreement pattern to use, and frequently
use a combination of both, or use one gender for agreement, then repeat themselves
using the other gender. In the following example, note the changes in gender agreement
between intonation units (slashes represent pauses on level pitch):10)    aka    roa     /    ruima ro              feo        / olang                 fi      Tagoila.

the feminine gender, even though it denotes a human male referent. Ruima is the only
word in Lavukaleve which behaves in this anomalous way with respect to its agreement
properties. Interestingly, the other human noun which could potentially have anomalous
agreement patterns is tu'tul ÔbabyÕ, which is neuter. However I have never observed
any anomalous agreement patterns associated with this word; it invariably takes neuter
agreement. Normally if speakers are discussing a particular baby they will refer to it
with a gendered noun, e.g. vo'vou ÔboyÕ or vo'vo ÔgirlÕ, instead of using tu'tul. Tu'tul

"The suffix -a, although it has different uses on transitive versus intransitive verbs, seems
to have a common functional core. On transitive verbs its function is to reduce the
syntactic transitivity of the verb on which it appears. Its function with intransitive verbs,
at least in its iterative use, is to reduce the semantic transitivity of the verb, in Hopper and
ThompsonÕs (1980) terms. In its intensifying use however this seems not to be the case.",[357]

"The referent which the deictic form agrees with may be the noun associated with the
deictic (if there is one), but it is by no means the case that it must be. It may be the
subject, object, complement or oblique argument of a nearby clause. It may be the topic
of the discourse, or the topic of a local piece of the discourse. There are absolutely no
syntactic constraints on what the predicate suffix may agree with. The only constraint is
the common sense one that the referent must be able to be retrieved by the hearer. Most
frequently the Predicative suffix will agree with the head noun of the deictic.",[226]

issues. This section attempts to make some generalisations about dual and plural

be analysed as rule-governed and the extent to which they must be seen as
unpredictable. This is particularly the case with respect to the phenomenon of the
masculine singular and feminine singular suffixes, which has been mentioned above,
but which needs further discussion. Also of particular interest are how borrowed words
behave under dual and plural formations; the phenomenon of multiple dual/plural
formation strategies for the same noun; homonyms; and the question of nouns which are
always plural, and have no singular or dual forms.","[139, 140]"

CHAPTER FIVE
Noun formation
Verbal inflectional processes in Lavukaleve are remarkably regular; all verb stems are
completely regular, and apart from a couple of straightforward morphophonemic rules,
there is only one form for each verbal affix. Nouns and noun inflections are, conversely,
very irregular. In many cases there are slightly different noun stems depending on
which suffix or prefix is to be added, and these are unpredictable by rule. In addition,
for some categories, the form of the suffix taken by a particular noun cannot be
predicted.","[114, 115]"

singular verb agreement:11)    Ngai      feil              roge         ale              fi.

possessed heads with a possessor noun referring to the super-ordinate category to which
the group noun belongs. In the following example, feil, the group noun, is expressed as
the possessed head of the NP, with mitakeu ÔdogÕ the possessor, referring to the
superordinate category. Note there is a number agreement clash in this example: the
speaker used a singular noun mitakeu and a plural possessive prefix ma-, to refer to the
same entity. It is not clear if this is a mistake or not. More examples would elucidate
this point:12)    Ngai     mitakeu        mafeil                      roge       ale                fi.

linguistic change in progress.","[78, 79]"
"Secondly, with respect to the loss of -a on feminine nouns, and -m on masculine nouns,
it is not the case that this always happens before dual or plural suffixation. Firstly, it is
not just feminine nouns which lose a final /a/ before a number suffix; in fact, neuter
nouns can too. For example the plural form of mola ÔcanoeÕ (n) is molev. Similarly the
plural of kera ÔpaddleÕ (n) is kerev. Secondly, not all m-final masculine nouns lose this
/m/ before a plural suffix: tamtam ÔreefÕ (m), tamtamaul (pl); ko'rom Ôblack                                               114

                                        16 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSESsubordinate parameter. However it is more difficult to tell if Lavukaleve follows the
kinds of typological generalisations made by Dixon or not. He points out that in
languages with a split based on main vs. subordinate clauses, which one is more likely
to be marked with a nominative/accusative system and which with an
ergative/absolutive system depends on the type of subordinate clause involved, and he
does not discuss the semantic types which LavukaleveÕs adverbial subordinate clauses
express. However one possibly relevant parallel is Tsimshian, which has a
nominative/accusative system for main clauses and an ergative/absolutive system for
subordinate clauses including examples like ÒÔHis mother was glad when she saw himÕÓ
(Dixon 1994: 103). The direction of this split is the same as in Lavukaleve.","[412, 413]"
"
THE MASCULINE AND FEMININE SINGULAR SUFFIXESOne issue which arises from the preceding data is that of singular marking. It is possible
to analyse the final /a/ in some feminine nouns, and the final /m/ in some masculine
nouns, as gendered singular markers: /a/ for feminine singular and /m/ for masculine
singular. This analysis has neat correlations with other gender/number agreement
marking in Lavukaleve. That is, -a is the feminine singular Agreement Suffix used in
verbs and adjectives; and -m is the corresponding masculine singular form. Also, this
analysis accounts for the loss of /a/ before some dual and plural suffixes (e.g. ruia Ôold
womanÕ (f) ruivil Ôold women (pl)Õ), and similarly the loss of /m/ before some dual and
plural suffixes (e.g. sulum ÔchiefÕ (m), suluverav Ôchiefs (pl)Õ. It certainly seems that it
is an accurate historical analysis. However, it is not the case that all final -m segments
occur on masculine singular nouns, or all final -a segments occur on masculine singular
nouns. Thus the analysis only has limited application. The reasons are as follows.",[140]
"The head, like any noun argument in Lavukaleve, does not have to be overt. It is always
retrievable, and in any case it is cross-referenced on the relative predicate and the
definite article, and often also on the main predicate. The following example shows a
relative clause without an overt head:52)    Aka kini       tataveuarea                       la         oesiale,
       aka kini       tataveua    -re        -a         la         o-       e- sia-le

present, is presumably mina ÔthingÕ, which is feminine, and thus controls the feminine
agreement.",[425]
"The third person/fourth person (or proximate/obviate) pronoun distinction in
Algonquian languages is also in a similar discourse area as oia, but with important
differences. In Blackfoot, for instance, if there are two or more animate nouns in the
same sentence, one must be cross-referenced as proximate (major third person), one as
obviate (minor third person) (Frantz 1991: 11-12). The speaker can choose which is
which, based on which is preferred as the more prominent participant in the discourse.
LavukaleveÕs oia pronoun differs from this kind of system, not only in that it is not as
grammaticalised, but also in that sentence boundaries are not relevant for oia. In
addition, as I understand it, 3rd/4th person assignment is fixed throughout a section of
discourse; the speaker chooses which referent is to be which and they remain that way.
Oia, however, is often used for alternately referring to different entities. Lastly, oia can
be used, even when no other competing participant has been mentioned, to mean
something like Ôthat one from before (who you might have forgotten about)Õ. This is
quite different from the fourth person function in Algonquian languages.",[201]
"
6.2 AGREEMENTGender is expressed in Lavukaleve primarily through agreement, not through the form
of the noun itself, despite the importance of phonological form of the noun for gender
assignment. Almost all nominal modifiers agree with their head nouns; that is, the
definite article, adjectives, demonstrative modifiers and the focus markers. Also
demonstrative pronouns show gender agreement. Further, some elements agree with
                                                    130

which cross-reference subjects) show gender agreement, as does the verbal Agreement
Suffix. Actually, all these elements show not just gender but also number agreement.
For most forms, gender and number are expressed together in portmanteau morphemes.

sentence:5)     airaol      le'laol        ruiaol          feol      leiaol.

       ...two old women live there.                                                co 033Throughout the language, however, all gender distinctions are shown only in the
singular and dual numbers; plural forms never express gender. This is true not just of
morphological affixes and grammatical words, but also of many lexical items (e.g.
vo'vou Ôboy childÕ, vo'voul Ôtwo boysÕ; vo'vo Ôgirl childÕ, vo'vol Ôtwo girls; tulav
Ôchildren (either/both sexes)Õ). That is, there is a syncretism of the three genders in the
plural number. This collapse of gender distinctions in the plural number is the kind of
syncretism which Corbett (1991: 190 ff.) calls convergence, and is a relatively common
phenomenon in the languages of the world. The only thing perhaps slightly less
common is the fact that gender distinctions are maintained throughout the dual number,
and converge only in the plural.","[156, 157]"
"Throughout this thesis, four-line example sentences are used. The first line consists of
surface forms; the second line consists of underlying forms; the third line is a                                             39

second lines are identical, but it is useful to have the two separate lines precisely for
those circumstances in which identical-vowel sequences are reduced; and for the few
other morphophonemic processes in the language. At the end of the fourth, free
translation line, comes an abbreviated symbol showing where the fragment comes from.
Appendix 2 contains the list of abbreviations with full details on the source of the data,
showing whether the material was elicited or came from spontaneous texts, and if the
latter, showing the name of the text and the name and village of the speaker.","[65, 66]"
"Note that it is perhaps possible to analyse these structures as independent clauses, with
the definite article functioning not as a definite article but rather as a kind of resumptive
determiner; thus, example (51) could be paraphrased as Ôthe man ate my fish: him, I
sawÕ. However there are a few arguments against this analysis. Firstly, resumptive
pronouns do occur in Lavukaleve, but they are demonstrative pronouns from the foia
paradigm (see Section 8.4). This is only a minor problem. Secondly, and more
importantly, it is never possible to put a definite article anywhere after the head noun,
apart from directly after the relative verb, which is at the end of the NP under the
analysis presented here. It is certainly not possible to add another definite article after
the head noun, for example (again using 51):55)   *Ali    na     ngafo'sal        aum             na     alem           fin.
       ali    na     nga-      fo'sal a-     u   -m   na     a-    le -m    fin
       man(m) sgmArt 1sgPOSS- fish(m) 3sgmO- eat -sgm sgmArt 1sgS- see -sgm 3sgmFOCThis suggests that the definite article is indeed functioning in its normal definite article
function, rather than as a resumptive determiner. This in turn suggests that the analysis
here, that these structures are indeed relative clauses, is correct.",[427]

                                  13 - WORD-LEVEL DERIVATIONThis Nominaliser suffix -io in almost all cases attaches to stems ending in -i. The general
morpho-phonemic rule of vowel cluster simplification when identical vowels come
together at morpheme boundaries (see Section 2.9.3) comes into play in these cases.
However words such as houio < hou ÔwaitÕ and luguio < lugu ÔthinkÕ show that the
form of the suffix is actually -io, not -o.","[348, 349]"

11.2.2 SYNTACTIC STATUSThe focus markers occur following and in construction with predicates plus their objects,
sentences, and non-predicating constituents. In the first example below, a focus marker is
in construction with the second NP of a non-verbal clause, in the second with a temporal
adjunct, in the third with a non-main verb (in this case a coordinate-dependent verb in a
clause chain) and in the fourth with an intransitive predicate. Throughout this chapter the
focussed constituents are italicised in the Lavukaleve; and in the English translation the
focussed element is in bold; the rest of this chapter justifies the claims implicit in this.",[275]
