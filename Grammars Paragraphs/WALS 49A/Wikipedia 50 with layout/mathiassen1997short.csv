"       From a diachronic perspective, both the noun (or the pronoun) and the gerund
(which represents a petrified participle form) will have been in the dative case. Such a
construction, labeled “the absolute dative” or “double dative” construction, is found also
in Lithuanian and has a parallel in Slavic. In other Indo European languages cases other
than the dative may be used to form gerundival clauses functionally equivalent to sub-

nitive and in Sanskrit the (double) locative.","[147, 148]"
"       4. Dative + ir/bija/bus etc. as Equivalents to have-
       Constructions in English
       In opposition to have-languages, such as English, German, the
Nordic languages and Romance, Latvian (like Russian, Balto-Finnic
languages and many others) is a be-language, e.g. man ir (bija, bus, ir
bijis, bija bijis, bus bijis) velosipéds / have (had, shall have, have
had, had had, will have had) a bicycle (lit. for me is/was etc. bicycle).
The grammatical subject, which understandably must be in the form of
the nominative, is velosipéds. See also under the nominative case on p.
181 below.    The corresponding question would be kas man          ir/bija
(etc.)? what do/did I have (etc.)?
       The negated counterpart to the sentence just quoted is man nav
(nebija, nebus, nav bijis, nebija bijis, nebus bijis) velosipéda / don’t
have (didn’t have, shall not have, have not had, had not had, shall not
have had) with a logical subject (= velosipéda) in the genitive case, cf.
p. 17I1f.
       Here one may also mention the verb of belonging piederét which
is construed in a similar way, e.g. man pieder velosipéds/ have a
bicycle (lit. to me belongs bicycle), again with velosipéds in the func-
tion of a grammatical subject, whence the nominative is required. When
‘belong to’ has the meaning of “belonging to a category / class’ and not
‘as property’, the prepositional construction piederét pie must be used,
e.g. lauva pieder pie zvériem the lion belongs to the wild animals, cf.

A Short Grammar of Lithuanian (Slavica 1996).
       The present volume has been written primarily for students of
Latvian as a foreign language at university level, but it can also be used
by others. It fulfills (and goes slightly beyond) the grammar require-
ments for the BA-degree in the UK and the USA, or the Foundation le-
vel (a one-year unit of study following an introductory course) in
Scandinavia. It can also be used for foreign students studying Latvian in
Latvia. Thus, the grammar presented here includes the fundamentals of
phonology, morphology (with some short passages on word formation),
and syntax in Latvian. Syntax is concentrated in the last chapters of the
book,   i. e. 8-10   (Case),   12 (The   Sentence),   13 (Agreement)   and   14
(Word Order). The syntax of adjectives, numerals and participles has, for
practical reasons, for practical reasons has been incorporated and dealt
with in the corresponding chapters: 3, 4 and 5.
       This book is primarily a synchronic, prescriptive (normative), not
a descriptive grammar. Notes on certain diachronic items as well as sup-
plementary information are given in small type.
      Where appropriate, short Latvian-English,         Latvian-Scandinavian
comparisons and similar remarks are provided.
       The examples used to illustrate grammatical rules have been taken
mainly from dictionaries and newspapers, or have been made up by the
author and checked with informants.
       Stress and intonation are given only for single words, not for sen-
tences or word groups.
       To facilitate lucidity and readability, the book is supplied with a
relatively comprehensive table of contents at the beginning of the vo-
lume, as well as an index at the end, where a list of reference literature is
also given. There should be no need for a table of abbreviations and
symbols used, since they are either explained in the text or are likely to
be immediately understandable. Thus, for example, C stands for ‘con-
sonant’, V for ‘vowel’ and R for ‘resonant’. For designating length in
phonetic transcription, two points after the vowel/consonant are used and
for semi-length one point (somewhat raised above the line).
       This grammar has been used in manuscript form by my students of
Latvian at the University of Oslo. I am grateful to them for their positive
18criticism. I am equally indebted to Janis Stalbergs for having read the
manuscript critically and for his corrections as well as good suggestions.
Thanks also to Carolina D. Ramos for having checked my English care-
fully, to Knut Skrindo for technical assistance as well as to The Nor-
wegian Academy of Sciences and Letters for its support and to Slavica
Publishers for printing the manuscript.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
"      4. Special Cases of Agreement in Case       Here mention should be made of combinations of common noun +
proper name where the latter appears in quotation marks as, for example,
in book titles etc. In such cases the proper name will remain undeclined
independent of the case of the common noun, e.g. romana “Kars un
miers” in the novel “War and Peace” . However, if the common noun is
deleted, the title must be declined (provided that it is declinable): “Kara
un miera” in “War and Peace”.
      With     titles of professions   + personal   names, however,   the title
and the proper name harmonize with respect to case, e.g. attiekties uz
profesori Rudziti to apply to Professor Rudzite, cf. also p. 168 and
202.
220                              AGREEMENT      Constructions with k a ‘as’ and similar
      The item appearing after ka as may be regarded as an apposition
in a broader sense. The corresponding items on either side of ka must
appear in the same case. When the apposition refers to the grammatical
subject   (which,   by definition, is in the nominative    case), the second
member may be characterized as a kind of subject predicative, e.g.:
      vins éd ka vilks he eats as (like) a wolf, suns kauc ka vilks the
dog is howling like a wolf.
       With transitive verbs, the direct object is in the accusative, as is its
reference, which may be labeled object predicative (or so-called double
 accusative): vinS raksturoja to (accusative object) ka skandalu (object
predicative) he characterized it as a scandal.
        Note: contrast the following two examples: es vinu pazistu ka
draugu : es vinu pazistu ka draugs, both meaning / know him as a
friend. The former utterance expresses that he is a friend (of somebody,
also of me), whereas in the latter, draugs refers to the subject, i. e. es,
buidams vina draugs, [...] /, being a friend of his [...].
       The same-case-on-either-side of ka principle also holds true for
intransitive verbs, e.g. vinS balstijas uz generativas gramatikas
(genitive) ka labas teorijas (genitive) he based himself upon genera-
tive grammar as a good theory. Exceptions to the rule are found in in-
stances such as tadas pilsétas ka Riga, Vilna un Tallina in such cities
as Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn. Neither in Latvian nor English is it natural
to say *tadas pilsétas ka Riga, Vilna un Tallina *in such cities as in
Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn. Observe also the following example: nekad
neatradisi tadu meiteni ka Sarma          (i. e. [...] ka ir Sarma) you    will
never find such a girl as Sarma (is).
       Finally, a reference should be made to pp. 60, 130, 137 and 146
for the dative of the predicative adjective or participle (when it is co-
referential with a logical (either overtly expressed or implicit) subject in
the dative case).

                                                           (Vardu seciba)
      Introductory Remarks
      The introduction of a bipartite communicative analysis of the utte-
rance, in theme   (i. e. given or known information) and rheme     (= new
information), by Czech linguists (Mathesius, and further elaborated by
Dane§ and others) signified no less than a revolution with respect to our
knowledge about the mechanisms and principles that govern word order.
        In prosodically neutral declarative sentences, the position of the
theme is initial, while the rheme occupies sentence final position. The
theme-rheme segmentation seems to be important in all languages, but is
of special importance in a non-article language like Latvian. In Germanic
and Romance languages the articles are of great help in identifying the
theme and the rheme, since the former usually adopts a definite form in
opposition to the latter, which normally shows either indefinite or zero
article, cf. the following example from English: — Yesterday I met an
old man (theme). The man/he (theme) was sitting outside a little, red
house (theme). The house/it (theme) had small windows (rheme). The
notions theme and rheme make sense only within a context which is
built up by theme-rheme chains as illustrated in the above example.
       A context must necessarily start at some point, whence the intro-
ductory part will usually be context non-dependent and consequently
themeless. For examples, see p. 223.
       Languages without a case system, such as English and the Nordic
languages, do not offer the same possibilities for variations in word order
as do case languages. In the former type of languages word order has a
grammatical function. Thus, in sentences containing the three constitu-
ents subject (S), verb (V) and object (O), the subject must occupy the
initial position in caseless languages whereas this is not obligatory in a
language like Latvian where the subject can be distinguished from the
object through the case ending, whereby their place in the sentence is not
so vital. Thus, in Latvian it is possible to say Péteris sita Povilu (SVO)
222                                  WORD ORDERor Povilu    sita Péteris (OVS).       The    former sentence      is translated     into
English as Peter hit Paul while for the second we have to choose a
passive      construction     Paul    was    hit by   Peter   to   satisfy   both     the
grammatical need for reserving the initial position for the subject and the
communicative need of preserving the theme-rheme structure of the
Latvian sentence. From the two sentence variants in Latvian it can be
concluded 1) that they are not identical from a communicative point of
view     since their theme-rheme       structures     are different and 2) that an
active OVS sentence in Latvian often corresponds to a passive
construction in English (see also section on voice, p. 140 ff.).
       Generally, it should be emphasized that the variations in word or-
der are fewer in non-fictional prose than in fiction and above all in col-
loquial speech (as well as in poetry). The presentation below is more or
less restricted to the sphere of non-fictional prose. Further, our descrip-
tion concentrates on simple sentences (p. 203) since very little has been
done     in the   field   of word    order   in compound       sentences     (p.    208),
especially large text units. A further complication is that there are few
works on word order in Latvian (Ceplite and Ceplitis 1991 contains a
short section devoted to this subject as does Rtke-Dravina 1977).
       Finally, one must distinguish between changeable and non-chang-
eable word order. The latter category includes the structurally determi-
ned obligatory sentence initial position of the interrogative particle vai
(vai Jus esat Kalnina kungs? are you Mr. Kalnins?), as well as the
position of the negation immediately before the word which is negated:
for example, vinS neraksta he doesn’t write : vinS raksta ne tikai
stastus, bet ari dzeju he writes not only short stories, but also poetry.
Moreover, among constructions with unchangeable word order could
probably be included a good number with a dative in the function of a
logical subject (debitive constructions with synonyms and others, see p.
130 f.
       It should be observed that changeable word order is not synony-
mous with free word order. Even though word order in Latvian is
changeable to a considerable degree, it is not free in the sense that varia-
tion in word order is of no importance. This is because a change in word
order will normally imply another communicative structure and thus al-
ter the content of the utterance. A change in word order can also alter the
style.
      The disposition below will be proceed according to the following
scheme:
      I The position of the members of the sentence
      II The position of the members of the noun phrase
                                   WORD ORDER                                    223        I] THE POSITION            OF THE MEMBERS                    OF THE
        SENTENCE        The analysis will start with sentences containing the sentence
members subject (S) and verb (V) only. From such structures we will |
proceed to extended structures (p. 199) including an object (QO), 1. e.
SVO-, OVS-structures etc. and also the somewhat looser structures with
adverbials (SVAdv/AdvVS etc.).","[216, 217, 218, 219, 220]"
"        3. Case
        (Locijums)
        Traditionally, grammars of Latvian have worked with a system of
 seven cases: the nominative, the genitive, the dative, the instrumental, the
 accusative, the locative and the vocative.
        However, the status of the alleged instrumental (which is identical
 in form with the accusative in the singular, the dative in the plural) in
 modern Latvian can be questioned, since it occurs only with the
 preposition ar with. As will be seen in the chapter on prepositions, all
 prepositions in Latvian take the dative case in the plural. Thus, it seems
 legitimate to assert that in modern Latvian there is no instrumental, and
 that the preposition ar governs the accusative (as does, for example, par
 about). However, departing from distributional criteria, it is problematic
 to claim that a given preposition governs one case (variably the
 accusative, genitive or dative) in the singular and another (invariably the
 dative) in the plural. A solution to the dilemma would be to assume two
 systems; i. e. one involving an accusative, genitive)» etc. for non-
 prepositional use, and another for prepositional use involving an accusa-
 tive2, genitive2 etc., but this conclusion would pose an obstacle to
 making simple generalizations. In this grammar we will agree with Fen-
 nell (1975, pp. 41-48 ), Létzsch (1978, pp. 667-671) and others, who
 have denied the existence of a separate instrumental case in Latvian,
 whence we arrive at a system consisting of six cases. For certain ad-
 verbialized residual traces of the Indo-European instrumental, see chapter
_ 8: Case.
         Of the remaining dependent (oblique) cases, it should be noted that
 the Latvian locative never occurs after a preposition. This is due to the
42                                      THE NOUNfact that from a diachronic point of view, the locative in Latvian seems
to originate in the old Indo-European locative, with superposition of an
imbedded postpositional element with subsequent rearrangements. The
vocative is, in virtue of its function as a case of address, somewhat apart,
since (unlike the rest) it is not incorporated in the syntax of a sentence.","[38, 39]"
"       F. The Polite Form of the 2nd P. Pl. Pronoun
       Further, the polite form of the personal pronoun Jus you requires
singular agreement with adjectives and participles when one person is
referred to; a finite form of the verb, however, must be in the plural: Vai
Jiis esat (pl.) vesels/vesela / noguris/nogurusi? are you healthy / tired?
                                  AGREEMENT                               219      G. The interrogative Pronoun        Kas
      The pronoun      kas? who?       is used with singular agreement, irre-
spective of the number of persons or objects referred to: Kas ir atnacis —
Janis un Péteris, vai tikai Janis? who has come — John and Peter or
just (only) John? (It should further be noted that in the Standard langu-
age kas shows only masculine agreement, not feminine.)       H. Group Subjects
       Finally, mention should be made of group subjects with quantifiers
in the role of grammatical head, accompanied by a noun or pronoun in
the genitive plural: jau ir atnacis daudz Jauzu lit. much people has -
already   arrived.   In such cases — according to the norm       ~ agreement      =
should be used.","[215, 216]"
"       Two Objects
       As in the case of adverbial modifiers, there may be more than one
 object in the sentence. A frequent case is that with an indirect (dative)
                                                                              ener,                               WORD   ORDER                            225object denoting a person + a direct accusative object referring to a thing,
e.g. meitene deva zénam gramatu the girl gave the boy a book. A
neutral reading of this sentence with no particular emphasis on any sen-
tence member implies that the dative object is thematic, the accusative
object rhematic. This SVOjndOdir order will probably be the commonest
(and consequently “neutral’”’) word order pattern for sentences containing
both a dative and an accusative object. If the order of the dative and the
accusative object is reversed, the latter will take over the thematic role
whereas the former will turn into a rhematic object: meitene deva
gramatu zénam the girl gave the book to a/the boy. In both cases the
objects both occur in postverbal position.
       In the case of pronominalization the pronoun (be it the indirect or
direct object) will usually precede the noun object, e.g. meitene deva
vinam gramatu (or, may be, even more commonly: meitene vinam
deva gramatu), meitene deva to zénam the girl gave it, i. e. the apple,
to a (the) boy.
        If both the indirect and the direct object are pronominalized, the
normal word order will be preverbal position for both, with the indirect
object preceding the direct one: meitene vinam vinu deva the girl gave
it to him. Pronominalization of this kind naturally signalizes thematiza-
tion. If the situation is clear, one of the pronominal objects can be dele-
ted, e.g. meitene izpéma gramatu no somas un vinam deva the girl
took a book out of the bag and gave (it) to him.","[221, 222]"
"        2. The Long (Definite) Form       The following guidelines should be given:
       The long form of the adjective can be used only in the function of
the attribute and the apposition, not in that of the predicative (except for
the superlative, cf. p. 60 above).
       Basically its function is thematic, i. e. it designates something
which    is known     from   the situation or context       (“given   information’):
Maza meitene raudaja the little girl was crying (note the definite ar-
ticle in English; in German, Dutch and the Nordic languages there is an
additional    lead in the form of the adjective das kleine Mddchen, het
kleine meisje, den lille piken (Norwegian)).
        In addition a set of formalized rules can be given. Thus, the use of
the long (definite) form is obligatory:
        1. after demonstrative pronouns: Sis jaunais direktors this young
director,
62                            THE ADJECTIVE                     a      2. after possessive pronouns and possessors in the genitive case:
mana/vinu/téva jauna automasina my/their/father’s new car;
      3 a) after the pronoun viss: visi jaunie pilsoni all new citizens;
      3 b) after abi/abas: abas mazas masas both the little sisters;
      4. with proper   nouns: Péeteris   Lielais Peter the Great, maza
Marta little Martha; Méina jira the Black Sea.
       5. in address (vocative function): MiJie draugi dear friends.
Observe that in the singular the nominative form of the adjective is used
if the noun is also in the nominative case (e.g. mila mamina dear
mother); if the noun has a special vocative form, the adjective can either
have the form of the nominative or the accusative, i. e. miJ4 mamin or
milo mamin; milais tétin or milo tétin dear father).
      6. in the expression vien- no [...] one of: viens    no   ievérojam-
akajiem (comparative/superlative) latvieSu rakstniekiem ir Karlis
Skalbe Karlis Skalbe is one of the greatest Latvian writers.
      7. for the purpose of substantivization (see also below): kurl-
mémais deaf-and-dumb, Balto armija The White Army (lit. “the army
of the white’).
       8. in so-called generic use: melna birza the black market, baltais
lacis white/polar bear, Sarkanais krusts The Red Cross.
       Note: Deviations from these rules can be found in fiction. In
addition, it should be stated that the norm was less stable in older
writings.
       Observe finally that some few adjectives (e.g. galvenais chief,
main; pédejais last) are always long.","[58, 59]"
"      THE NOMINATIVE
      The nominative case has four main functions in Latvian:
       1) as grammatical subject in two part sentences (see p. 205)
which can be in the active or passive voice (p. 135 ff.), e.g. bérns zimé
(suni) the child is drawing (a dog) and maja tiek celta the house is
buing built. Observe also the type man ir velosipéds (p. 178).
      2) as the only principal member (galvenais loceklis) in so-called
nominative one part sentences (p. 207), e.g. vakars (it is) evening, and
      3) as part of the nominal predicate (p. 198), i. e. in the form of a
nominal word class (i. e. a noun, adjective or pronoun) after a
copulative verb (i. e. verbs with the meaning of be in a non-existential
sense and become, cf. also p. 198), e.g. vins (ir) bérns he is a child,
vins (ir) jauns he is young. Note the use of the nominative, not the
genitive case in the corresponding negative statement vinS nav
(copulative verb) bérns/jauns he is not a child/ young in opposition to,
for example, te nav bérnu there are no children here with an automatic
genitive after the existential verb nav.
       Observe also formula saukt ko kas: vinu sauc Janis his name is
Janis (lit. ‘they call him John’) as well as the construction klit par (+
the accusative) to become in the sense of German werden zu: kJut par
arstu to become a physician.
       In connection with 3) one may also mention the nominative after
ka as in constructions of the type vina ir zinama ka Joti interesanta
dzejniece she is known as a very interesting poet.
       4) as object in debitive constructions (cf. p. 130), e.g. man
jaraksta véstule / have to write a letter. If the debitive predicate con-
sists of a phasal auxiliary plus an infinitive, either the nominative or the
case required by the infinitive can be used: man jasak rakstit véstule
(nom.)/véstuli (acc.) J must begin writing the letter. The nominative
object is avoided with pronouns of the Ist and 2nd person: man tevi (not
*tu) jaredz J have to see you (but: man vins jaredz/ have to see
182                                CASEhim). Observe that the logical subject of the debitive construction is al-
ways in the dative case (cf. p. 130).
      5) A last, but marginal function of the nominative is encountered       —
in certain appositions (see p. 219), e.g. romana    “Mérnieku     laiki” in
the novel “The Times of the Landsurveyors” .","[178, 179]"
"       The Romance languages and (most of) the Slavic also have a passive morpho-
logy of the same type as English.
       The morphological make-up of the German and the Nordic Passive has analy
been dealt with on p. 136.             +     . .
                                          SOY
       Motivations for choosing Passive Constructions.
       General Considerations
       Generally speaking, there are two important motivations for choo-
sing a passive construction over an active:             Bote        1, Passive constructions have a different functional sentence per-
spective (FSP) than the corresponding active, called “theme-rheme”
structure,
       2. Passive constructions admit deletion (omission) of the agent       1. Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP)
       The following two sentences have differing functional sentence
perspectives:        (1) The workmen are building a house
        (2) The house is being built by workmen        In (i) ‘the workmen’ belongs to the theme (i. e. is part of the gi-
ven information) whereas ‘a house’ is rhematic (i. e. brings new infor-
mation). In (2) the situation is the reverse: ‘the house’ is thematic,
‘workmen’ rhematic.
      In context-bound, non-emphatic sentences, the theme appears at
the beginning of the utterance, the rheme at the end. This theme-be-
fore-rheme order should be considered as a general rule. Furthermore, in
140                          THE VERB:   VOICEarticle languages (English, Nordic, Romance) a thematic noun will ap-
pear with a definite article whereas a rhematic noun is usually accom-
panied by an indefinite article. In non-article languages (such as
Latvian), the criterion for recognition of the theme is in fact its initial
position; see p. 221. The same is observed in English with proper names,
cf. Peter (thematic) beat Paul      (thematic)   vs. Paul   (thematic)   was
beaten by Peter (rhematic).","[136, 137]"
"
       B. Extended Sentences       a) Adverbial Extensions
       Adverbial modifiers can simply be placed before the V in VS type
sentences: istaba iegaja meitene into the room a girl entered; uz sienas
karajas glezna on the wall a painting is hanging. These AdvVS structu-
res with thematic adverbial + rhematic subject are in contrast to SVAdv-
constructions with thematic subject + rhematic adverbial: meitene iegaja
istaba the girl entered the room, glezna karajas uz sienas the painting
is hanging on the wall.
       The structure AdvSV      is also encountered, e.g. svétdienas avizes
 neiznaca on Sundays newspapers were not published.        b) Object Extensions
        One Object
        Such sentences have to some extent already been commented upon,
 in the examples quoted above, namely SVO (Péteris sita Povilu) vs.
 OVS (Povilu sita Péteris), under introductory remarks (p. 221 f.). For
 that illustration a transitive verb (sist) was chosen. The definition of
 transitivity in caseless languages, however, differs from that which is
 valid for case languages. In the former group, a verb can be defined as
 transitive without any constraint as to the nature of the object by which it
 is accompanied,     whereas   in the latter (as a rule), only   verbs   which
 govern the accusative (without involvement of prepositions) can be
 transitive, i. e. can be “transformed” from active to passive or vice versa.
 Thus, a sentence like the boy was helped should be rendered in Latvian
 by zénam palidzéja and not *zéns tika palidzéts since the verb
 palidzét to help requires the dative case and is consequently intransitive.
        The unmarked (or neutral) word order of Latvian is probably
 SVO. This order is obligatory in cases where the object cannot formally
 be distinguished from the subject, e.g.: mates mil meitas mothers love
 daughters.",[221]
"        The construction is parallel to the one indicated in the word-for-word translation
into English. In Old Latvian, the participle was declinable and occurred in the accusative
case in the construction in question, since syntactically it occupied the function of an ap-
position (cf. p. 202) which was in agreement with the object (Almu in the above exam-
ple). The construction corresponds to the so-called “accusativus cum infinitivo”-con-
struction in Latin, German, Nordic and certain other languages: audivi eum venire, Ich
hérte ihn kommen, Norwegian jeg hgrte ham komme, expressed in English by J heard
him coming.",[147]
"         The Object
         (Papildinatajs)      Like the subject, the object is usually expressed through one of the
nominal word classes, noun or pronoun, but — unlike the subject — it
must be in a dependent, i. e. non-nominative case (except for the nomi-
native    object   in debitive constructions,   see p.   130   above).   Like   the
subject, the object can also be in the form of an infinitive. Examples:
Aina lasa gramatu Aina is reading a book; Aina to lasa Aina is
reading it (i. e. the book); bérns iemacas lasit the child is learning to
read.
         A distinction is made between the direct object in the accusative
case after transitive verbs and the indirect with intransitive verbs, i. e.
verbs requiring dependent cases other than the accusative. Example of an
indirect object: palidzét mammai to help (the) mother.
       The question as to whether the genitive of negation or the partitive
genilive in connection with transitive verbs should be labeled a direct or
indirect object seems to be a kind of grammatical grey zone. For exam-
ples, see chapter 8 on case.
       Depending on the case, one can speak of accusative, genitive, da-
tive and locative objects, e.g. lasit gramatu to read a book; kaunéties
déla to be ashamed of the son; palidzét matei to help the mother;
piedalities sacikstés to participate in the competetion.
200                                THE SENTENCE        An object (in the accusative, genitive or dative) expressed through
a prepositional    phrase    is called a prepositional        object.   An   example
illustrating a prepositional object: Si gramata pieder pie autora
labakajiem darbiem this book belongs to the best works of the auth-
or.
       Finally, it should be emphasized that some predicates can or must
be combined with more than one object, whereby a frequent combination
is that of an indirect (dative) object denoting a person and a direct
(accusative) object for the thing: VinS nopirka vinai dargu gredzenu
he bought her an expensive ring.
       The type of subordination with objects is government.","[196, 197]"
"      Syntax and Semantics
      From a semantic point of view adverbs can be divided into:
      © of manner (atri fast, patikami pleasantly),
        of place (e. g. te here, kur where),
      ¢ of time (vienmér always, ieprieks before),
      e of cause and purpose (tade} therefore).
      e interrogative (cik? how much/many?, kur? where?, kad?
      when?)
      e indefinite (kaut kad sometime, kaut kur somewhere)
      e negative (nekad never, nekur nowhere)       Syntactically, adverbs can serve as modifiers of a verb (iet atri
walk fast), another adverb (/iet/ Joti atri walk very fast) or an adjective
(loti garSigas pusdienas a very tasty dinner).
       Illustrations of the use of the comparative and the superlative:
Petéris skrien atri, Ojars atrak, bet Janis visatrak Peter runs fast,
Ojars faster, but John fastest (of all).
        The formal appearance of an adverb also has the the i-form in ad-
jectival function, found in cases like: man bija auksti / fe/t (lit. was)
cold : man bija aukstak / felt colder, cf. p. 179 and 208.
        While the adverb in the positive can be strengthened by Joti very,
in the comparative daudz much must be used. Compare: Joti labi very
well : daudz labak much better. More bookish synonyms for daudz be-
fore a comparative are krietni and ievérojami, both of which may be
translated into English by considerably.
        The Latvian equivalent of English “than” in comparisons is in
most cases neka (ka after a negated verb), e.g. Janis skrien atrak neka
Pétéris John runs faster than Peter, Janis neskrien atrak ka Pétéris
John does not run faster than Peter.
        The syntax of indefinite and negative adverbs is parallel to that
described under indefinite and negative pronouns, see p. 70 ff. Observe
constructions of the type man nay kur iet / have nowhere to go vs. es
nekur neeju / don’t go anywhere, I go nowhere.
|   164                             THE ADVERB           The Negation
            The Latvian negation is ne which in most cases is written together         —
    with the word which is negated, most frequently a verb, e.g. vinS
    neruna latviski he doesn’t speak Latvian. The negated counterpart of
    ir is, are is nav, cf. Latvija nav lauvu (for the genitive, see p. 171f.) in
    Latvia there are no (are not any) lions (positive statement: Afrika       ir
    lauvas in Africa there are lions), vina nav studente she is not a stu-             —
    dent (positive statement: vina ir studente she is a student). Note the         —
    mandatory nominative studente, since nav in this example has the func-
    tion of a copulative verb and not that of an existential one as in Latvija             —
    nav lauvu where a genitive construction is required because of the exis-
    tential verb nav.
           Beside verbs the negation can also accompany other parts of spe-
    ech, e.g. adjectives (negudrs unwise, silly), participles (nepazistams
    unknown, negaidits unexpected) and adverbs (nelabi not well, bad(ly)).                 —
           The negational element ne- is further encountered with negative
    pronouns (p. 72) and adverbs (see above), e.g. neviens nobody, nekas
    nothing, nekur nowhere. In this case it has to be repeated by another ne-
    before a verb, so-called double negation, e.g. neviens no jums nezina
    none of you knows.
           English neither nor is rendered in Latvian by ne ne or nedz nedz.

        Introduction
        A chapter on case should include both prepositional and non-pre-
positional use. However, certain considerations — both practical and theo-
retical — have led the author to treat prepositional functions in a separate
chapter under the heading “Prepositions”.
       The syntactic functions of the oblique cases in Latvian, i. e. all ca-
ses except the nominative and the vocative, can be of three kinds:        1} adnominal (= govermed by a nominal word class, i. e. a noun,
        an adjective, a pronoun or a numeral),
        2) adverbal (= governed by a verb),
        3) adverbial (= with the same function as an adverb)          We consider this disposition a practical and adequate one despite the fact that 3)
 is not parallel with 1} and 2), since adverbial does not mean governed by an adverb, but
functioning as an adverb. An alternative and in a way more consistent solution would
have been to work with the notions ‘government’ (Latv. parvaldijums, see p. 200) and
 ‘juxtaposition’ (or ‘adjunction’, Latv. piek/avums, cf. p. 200), but in that case we would
 have had to put under the government heading that which is dealt with both under 1)
and (the bulk of) 2) above, which in our view would have meant a less transparent and
 practical disposition. Furthermore, the notion of primykanie (“juxtaposition”) — well
 known in Russian and Latvian (and other East European) grammatical traditions, but
 less in the West — would be unfamiliar to many readers.
          A second altemative, namely to follow a scheme object vs, adverbial relations
 would not have paid due attention to point 1).","[160, 161, 162]"
"
      Asyndetism
      Asyndetism (for definition, see p. 208) can have the functions of
both coordination and subordination. Which of these two main functions
is present in each concrete case, becomes evident through the context.
Thus, a sentence like dod man to smirdoSo abolu — es vinu apédisu
can be interpreted either as give that stinking apple to me, and I will eat
it or if you give [...], I [...].
                                                               Chapter 13                                                      AGREEMENT
                                                                     (Saskanojums)
       Agreement is one of the three ways of expressing subordination in
Latvian (cf. p. 200) and can be defined as a morphological repetition
(through desinences) of one and the same grammatical category within
certain syntactic relations.
       Relevant grammatical categories are: 1. gender, 2. number, 3.
person and 4. case, and the relevant syntactic relations are:
       A. that between attribute and governing word, cf., for example,
jauna maja : jaunas majas : jaunu maju a new house : of a new
house : of new houses where the attributive adjective agrees in gender,
number and case with the head noun,
       B. that between the subject and predicate, e.g. maja ir jauna :
majas ir jaunas the house is new : the houses are new (agreement in
gender, number (and case) between the subject and the nominal part of
the nominal predicate), and
       C. that between the antecedent and the anaphoric pronoun
(including the relative) as, for instance, in: kada parka sédéja virietis.
Ar vinu runaja sieviete there was a man sitting in a park. A woman
was speaking with him; [...] virietis, ar ko runaja sieviete [...]              a man
with whom a woman was speaking.
       For convenience, relation A. is generally referred to as attributive
agreement and B. as predicate agreement. Relation C. will only be mar-
ginally commented upon.","[211, 212]"
"
       Case Government
       The genitive, accusative and marginally the dative can be governed
by prepositions in Latvian, whereas the locative — and, of course, the
nominative and the vocative — cannot. Genetically speaking, the locative
has an “imbedded” postposition. As mentioned (p. 41 above) we do not
see the necessity of working with an instrumental case in Latvian because
of the merger of this case with the accusative in the singular, the dative
in the plural.
       Only two prepositions govern more than one case, namely pa
(accusative and dative) and uz (accusative and genitive). When governed
by the accusative, pa has the following meanings: along, on; through;
during/in; by; with the dative it has a “distributive” meaning, cf. below.
                                 PREPOSITIONS                            185The preposition uz takes the accusative in the sense of to. When combi-
ned with the genitive it corresponds to English on (and rarely in).
      One     preposition   (lidz until) governs the dative case. /t should,
however, be emphasized that all semi-prepositions/adverbs (cf. above)
also require the dative case. Notice also that accusative- and genitive-
governing prepositions in certain idiomatic expressions combine with the
dative when followed by the demonstrative pronoun tas: bez tam besi-
des; pie tam moreover (but bez ta without that, pie tam at (near)
that). Observe also the conjunction péc tam kad after (when).
       Eight prepositions govern the accusative case. They will be menti-
oned in alphabetical order and should be learned by heart by the student:
ap around, ar with, caur through, gar along, par about (concerning),
par across, pret against, towards and starp between, among.
       All remaining prepositions govern the genitive which consequently
is the case most frequently encountered after prepositions in Latvian. The
two postpositions dé] and labad (together with laika) also require the
genitive case (adnominal genitive, cf. p. 166 ff.), since they originally
represent petrified noun forms. The genitive governing prepositions are
the following (in alphabetical order):
       aiz behind; across; after; because of (for), Aarpus outside, bez
without; except (but), dé) because of; for (the sake of); kop§ since,
labad for the sake of, no from; out of, otrpus on the other side, péc
after; for, pie at; with; to, pirms before; ago, prieks before, virs over;
above, zem under; beneath.
       Finally, under this point a peculiarity of Latvian (which has also
attracted the interest of linguists in general) and an extremely important
feature in the grammar of Latvian prepositions should be noticed: in the
plural all Latvian prepositions govern the dative — irrespective of the
case (or cases) they require in the singular, e.g. pa ielu (acc.sg.) along
the street: pa ielam (dat.pl.) along the streets, bez drauga (gen.sg.)
without     a friend: bez    draugiem    (dat.pl.) without friends. The two
postpositions, dé] and labad, however, retain their genitive government
also in the plural, e.g. gruitibu dé] due to difficulties, bernu labad to
the benefit of the children.
       Note: all prepositional adverbs (cf. p. 183) govern the dative case
in both numbers.","[181, 182]"
"       A. The governing Word is a Noun
       In this case the genitive is in pre-position. The following functio-
nal types should be distinguished:        a) The Possessive Genitive        The meanings of this genitive are those of possession and belong-
ing:
        masas   gramata sister's book, koka     zari the branches of the
tree.
        It is worth noting that where an adjective would appear in langua-
ges like Slavic, Germanic and Romance, Latvian will often use a noun in
the genitive case, e.g. latvieSu valoda the Latvian language (lit. ‘the
language of the Latvians’).        b) The Subjective and c) the Objective Genitive      The governing words are here exclusively verbal nouns.
      Examples of the subjective genitive:
      skolnieka atbilde the pu-pil’s answer, armijas aplenkums the
siege of the army, Kolumba atklajums Columbus’ discovery, cf. the
corresponding verb phrases skolnieks atbild the pupil answers, armija
aplenc the army is besieging and Kolumbs atklaja Columbus disco-
                                           CASE                                        167vered with skolnieks and Kolumbs in the function of subjects. As is
seen from the ilustrations, the subjective genitive is found with verbal
nouns derived both from intransitive and transitive verbs,
      An example of the objective genitive is Amerikas atklaSana the
discovery of America, cf. atklat Ameriku to discover America with
Amerika      as object. Observe       that only verbal nouns which correspond
with transitive (i. e. non-prepositional accusative governing) verbs can
be construed with the objective genitive. Other examples: bérnu aud-
zinaSana upbringing of children (: audzinat        bérnus), armijas
aplenkSana the siege of the army, i.e. the army is besieged (: armija
ir aplenkta).
      The subjective and objective genitive can be combined in Latvian,
although many Latvians will find such constructions rather clumsy, cf.
for example Kolumba Amerikas atklaSana Columbus’ discovery of
America / the discovery of America by Columbus.","[163, 164]"

       Latvian and Lithuanian (along with the extinct Old Prussian) to the
Baltic language group which constitutes a branch of its own of the Indo-
European (IE) family of languages. To IE also belong the Slavic langua-
ges — among them Russian, Byelorussian and Polish — as well as the
Germanic languages, whose main members are English, German, Dutch
and the Nordic languages. Thus, there is a remote link between English
and Latvian. Within the Indo-European framework the Baltic languages
are more closely related to the Slavic branch than to any other IE ling-
uistic subdivision. The alleged similarities between Baltic and Slavic
should, however, not be exaggerated. At any rate, there is obviously no
mutual understanding between — let us say — a Russian and a Latvian
when they speak their mother tongues, whereas a Russian and a Pole will
(to a certain extent) be able to communicate.
       During the Middle Ages, history, culture and religion separated
Latvia from Lithuania because the latter entered the Polish sphere of in-
fluence, while the former experienced an impact above all from German
language language and culture. Thus, the Teutonic and other orders in-
vaded the territory corresponding to present-day Latvia and later on
Germans (consisting of gentry, tradesmen and clergy) settled there. In
terms of language, Latvian was also influenced by the now almost extinct
Livonian, which along with Estonian, Finnish and some minor languages
(Karelian, Vepsian,   Votic) constitutes the Balto-Finnic branch of the
Finno-Ugric language family.
      In the vocabulary of Latvian several layers can be distinguished.
First, there is a basic IE vocabulary — for instance, the word for ‘heart’,
sirds, which has cognates in other IE languages. The same is true for the
words for ‘mother’, ‘sun’, ‘moon’, ‘day’ etc: mate, saule, méness, di-
ena. Then, there is the Balto-Slavic stratum, containing words known
exclusively within these two groups of IE; for instance, Latvian galva,
Lithuanian galva, Russian golova, Polish gtowa, meaning ‘head’ in all of
thelanguages quoted. Another example is the word for ‘hand, arm’:
Latvian roka, Lithuanian ranka, Russian ruka and Polish reka (all from
20                            INTRODUCTIONearlier *ranka). A third layer may be discerned of words limited to the
group of Baltic languages alone, e. g. Latvian kaja and Lithuanian koja,
both meaning    ‘foot, leg’. If we continue   with the body, the word   for
‘hair’ may serve as an example of where the Baltic languages are split
from another: the Latvians say mati, the Lithuanians plaukai. This
scheme of several layers should not be oversimplified and regarded as an
automatic indicator in terms of chronology, but should be looked upon as
a purely guiding and schematic principle. Finally, both Latvian and its
sister language, Lithuanian, have through the centuries adopted a great
number of borrowings and international words from different sources
and languages, most frequently from or through (Old and Modern)
Russian (e. g. gramata book, dzinsi jeans) and (Low) German (e. g.
brokastis breakfast, slims ill, un and), but a Finno-Ugric (Livonian)
impact (e. g. maja house, the interrogative particle vai) is also strongly
felt. Today the impact of English on the vocabulary is (of course)
considerable.
       Latvian is spoken by roughly 1.5 million people in Latvia proper
which means about 55% of the population (the bulk of the remaining in-
habitants are Russian speaking). In addition, there are approximately two
hundred thousand ethnic Latvians living abroad — above all in Germany,
Great Britain and Sweden and overseas in America and Australia.
       The Latvian language map can be split into a number of subdia-
lects. The main division, however, is that between High Latvian (or
Latgalian, in the east where we find such cities as Daugavpils and
Rézekne), and Low Latvian. Low Latvian is divided between the Central
dialect (encompassing such centers as Riga and Jelgava) and the so-called
Tamian dialect (found on both sides of the outer parts of the Riga Bay,
as well as the area around the city of Ventspils). Although the standar-
dization process took a relatively long time, the Modern Standard langu-
age came into use during the second half of the 19th century, on the basis
of the Central dialect (Latv. vidus dialekts). Several factors favored this
dialect to become the foundation of the Standard language; i. e., presence
of important economic, commercial and cultural centers within the re-
gion where this dialect is spoken, as well as a lesser degree of influence
from neighbouring foreign languages (Slavic and Finno-Ugric) than in
High Latvian and the Tamian dialects.
      The use of the Latvian language was hampered by German supre-
macy over the centuries. In this century, its use was limited during the
Soviet regime (1945-1991), but today it has regained the dominant role
it had achieved during the first period of independence (1920-1940). A
manifestation of this is the Latvian Language Law of 1989 (with
subsequent Amendments), according to which Latvian is given the status
of the official State Language of Latvia.

       to the era of the Reformation; i. e., the sixteenth century (to be exact, the
       years of 1585, with the Catholic Cateciiiem, and 1586, with the Lutheran
       Catechism).

       features.

         I Consonants       There are 26 consonant phonemes in Standard Latvian. As can be
seen in the table below, the binary unvoiced : voiced opposition constitu-
tes 9 pairs (i. e. /p/ vs. /b/, /t/ vs. /d/ etc.). Another, less comprehensive
opposition is that between non-palatalized : palatalized which encom-
passes 4 pairs, e. g. /t/ vs. /t/, /n/ vs. /n/.               labial          dental         alveolar        palatal         velar

          Note: The above table takes into consideration only the so-called upper articula-
tor (i. e. the upper lips, the upper teeth and the palate), neglecting the Jower. However,
in the comments on the pronounciation of the different consonants which follow the
lower articulator is also referred to where appropriate, especially the tongue and its dif-
ferent zones, i. e. the apex (adj. apical) ‘tip of the tongue’, the corona (adj. coronal)
‘tongue blade’ and the dorsum (adj. dorsal) ‘back of the tongue’.
        It should also be emphasized that the table is based on phonemic principles and
further that palatalization is looked upon as an additional articulation which allows us to
place palatalized phonemes in the same zones (dentals etc.) as their unpalatalized coun-
terparts. It is vital to say this in order to prevent students from making false conclusions
regarding the pronunciation of Latvian consonants. For guidelines on pronunciation the
next paragraph should be consulted.
                                 PHONOLOGY                                  23        Phonetic Realization
        Comments on pronunciation of the separate sounds will be limited
to those which may cause the greatest difficulties to the student. In addi-
tion certain allophones will be commented upon.
        First of all it should be stated that the Latvian unvoiced plosives p,
t, k are unaspirated.
      [n] has an allophone [n] which is encountered before [k] and [g],
e. g. [banka] (written banka, cf. below) ‘bank’, [bungas] (written
bungas) ‘drum’.
       [t] and [d] (which are encountered mainly in borrowings) differ in
their pronunciation from [t] and [d] in that they are palatalized, which
means that they are pronounced with the (middle part of the) tongue rai-
sed in the direction of the zone of the hard palate, i. e. to the jli-posi-
tion. The [j] and the consonant in question are pronounced simultane-
ously in such a way that the [j] is “absorbed” in the process and therefore
not heard. Two more sounds, i.e. [n] and [1] are palatatalized.
       Palatalization is regarded as an additional articulation superimpo-
sed on the corresponding non-palatalized consonant, which is regarded as
basic and the point of departure for the palatalized variant, for example,
[n] vs. [n]. [j] is unique in that it is not palatalized, but an original pala-
tal.
       [v] is regarded as a fricative, not an approximant, in Latvian. It
differs from [f] only with respect to the feature [+ voiced].
       [z] is the voiced counterpart of [s] and is pronounced like the
English -s- in please whereas the [3] is similar to the sound heard in vi-
sion or to the j in French jour. Of the affricates, [fS] is pronounced like
ts in hats, [dz] like dz in buds, [ff] like ch in church and [&] like g(e)
in the English pronounciation of George.
       The sound [x] is pronounced approximately like the ach-Laut of
German. It has a soft (i. e. palatalized) variant [xj] which may still be
heard before or after front vowels, e. g. [texjnika] and [arxjeoloks], in
emigré milieus, but not usually in Latvia proper.
       [r] has an apico-dental (or apico-alveolar) articulation which is
pronounced with 2-3 vibrations. It used to have a palatalized counterpart
[r] which, however, is not spoken any more in the Standard language and
has practically no support in the dialects.
       Latvian [1] is difficult to pronounce correctly. It is an apico-alveo-
lar and is realized as such also in the position before front vowels, e.g. in
liels big. To a student familiar with Russian it may remind of the hard (i.
e, non-palatalized) Russian /, but upon closer examination it is clearly
distinct from it. The student should practice the Latvian / carefully in
language laboratory exercises. As is seen in the above table, [I] has a pa-
latalized counterpart which is close to the Russian palatalized [l].
24                                           PHONOLOGY
      Orthographic Representation
      Except for the following deviations the consonants of Latvian are
represented in the orthography in the same way as illustrated in the pho-
nemic chart above:
          The affricates /fs/, /dz/, /€J/ and /d3/ are written c, dz, ¢ and dz re-
spectively.
       The fricative /x/ is expressed through h. Until the orthographic re-
form of 1957 the digraph ch was also used (it is still partly preserved in
emigré press). Discussions on the orthographic representation(s) of [x]
are frequently observed. Many Latvians react against such notations as,
for example, Bahs against the earlier, traditional Bachs for the name of
the famous composer.
                The sounds [t] and [d] are written k and g respectively. To
some readers our phonetic classification of them on a par with the dentals
t and d (cf. the above table) may seem somewhat odd and radical.
Nevertheless, this conception is in conformity with the phonetic reality
behind them. One may in this connection remind about the Latvian way
of treating the Gorbachovian word glasnost’ which the Latvians wrote
glasnosk. Examples of g are kugis ship and génijs genius.
       Until 1946 (and still in parts of the emigré press) one could find
the grapheme rf to denote a palatal r. Thus, one would, for example,
write kara — and not as now — kara in the genitive sg. of the word for
 ‘war’ kar§. A trace of the former palatalization in this word form is the
nominative marker -5, and not -s as, for example, in gars, gen. gara
spirit.","[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]"
"       Relative Function
      The relative pronoun agrees with its correlate in gender and num-
ber, whereas case is determined by its function (subject, object etc.) in
the subordinate clause, e. g. te ir gramata (fem. sg. nom.), kuru/ko
(fem. sg. acc. = object) tu man devi here is the book (which) you gave
me. Unlike in English (and some other languages, among them the
Nordic languages), the relative pronoun can never be omitted in Latvian.
       The genitive of kas is used only after prepositions, e. g. to
cilvéku, pie ka més bijam vakar, sauc Valdmanis the person with
whom we were yesterday, is called Valdmanis.
       In the non-prepositional function of whose? the genitive of kur§ is
used, i. e. kura for the masc. sg., kuras for the f. sg. and kuru for the
plural (both genders): te ir puika, kura tévs [...] here is the boy whose
father [...], te ir meitene, kuras tévs [...] here is the girl whose father
[...J, te ir bérni, kuru tévs [...] here are the children whose father [...].
       Irrespective of the fact that kas is formally singular, it can be used
with reference to nouns in plural form as well, e. g.
       studenti, kas (or kuri) piedalijas ekskursija [...] the students              —
who participated in the excursion [...]
       Kas can be regarded as the main (and unmarked) relative pronoun.          —
It should be replaced by kurS/kura only when the gender and number
reference will be unclear.",[67]
"       2. Partitive       a) A partitive function is encountered after some otherwise transi-
tive verbs (i. e. verbs requiring a direct object in the accusative case),
such as (no)pirkt in (no)pirkt piena/puku buy (some) milk/flowers.
       The genitive is here contrasted with the accusative, cf. (no)pirkt
pienu/pukes buy (all) the milk/the flowers. Other examples: ést siera
eat cheese, gribéties auglu want fruit.
       Thus, an important opposition is apparent between the genitive —
expressing a part (hence the notion partitive) of the object encompassed
by the verbal action, and the accusative — implying command of the
whole object. However, in contemporary Latvian it seems possible also
to use the accusative instead of the genitive without any real difference in
meaning: ést sieru, gribéties auglus.
       The genitive:accusative case opposition often corresponds to the
indefinite :definite opposition in languages which have developed a sys-
tem of articles, such as English, German and the Nordic languages.",[169]
"      Constructions without an Agent
      As mentioned above, agentless passive sentences in English can
be translated by formally passive constructions in Latvian. Thus, the
sentence ‘he is bullied every day’ corresponds to Latvian vins tiek ap-
celts katru dienu (where the participle agrees in gender, number and
case [ nominative] with the subject vins). However, it is also possible to
use a formally active one-part sentence (cf. p. 205 ff.) with the structure
OV: vinu apce] katru dienu with a formally active OV-structure. Both
solutions have the patient (vins/vinu) in the thematic initial position.",[138]
"
       4. The Debitive       A. Formation
       The debitive is a specific formation of Latvian alonc. It is formed
with the help of the proclitic particle ja- (of obscure origin) + the 3rd p.
of the present tense indicative, e.g. jaruna ( < runat to speak) / jasak
(< sakt to begin).
       An exception is the verb but, where the debitive is formed on the
basis of the infinitive: jabit.
      The debitive distinguishes all six tenses of the indicative, cf. the
following paradigm:
130                              THF VERB:     MOON       simple present: — (ir) jaruna
       simple past:      bija jaruna
       simple future:    bus jaruna
       present perfect:  ir bijis jaruna
       past perfect:         bija bijis jaruna
       future perfect:       bus bijis jaruna       The debitive has two sub-moods, namely those of the subjunctive
and the relative mood, cf.
       the subjunctive in:
       man bitu (pres.) / biitu bijis (past) jaruna
       I should have / have had to speak
and the relative mood in:
       man esot (pres,) / bisot (pret.) jaruna
       ! (am said) to have to be saying       The status of the debitive as a marked mood could be questioned on the follo-
wing grounds: first, it has as many tenses as the indicative, whereas a marked mood is
characterized through a poorer inventory of tenses (for example, the imperative with
only one tense, or the subjunctive with two); second, it distinguishes sub-moods which
again could be taken as an argument against its status as a marked mood or a mood at
all.
       B. Syntax
       The (logical) subject of the debitive is in the dative case, e.g.
       Man (ir) jaruna / must/have to speak.
       Note also that in sentences with an adjective in the function of a
predicative, the adjective must be in agreement with the dative subject
and therefore appear in the dative case, ¢.g.
       Studentiem jabut uzmanigiem
       The students have to be attentive
       Moreover, the object of a transitive verb appears in the nomin-
ative, and not the accusative case, e.g.
       man jalasa avize! have to read the newspaper       Note: The accusative should, however,            be used in two contexts,
namely after a transitive infinitive or if the object is a pronoun of the Ist
or 2nd person, cf.
      Man jasak fasit avizil have to begin to read the newspaper
      Ojaram bis mus jaapmekle Ojars will have to look for us       Observe that when the dative subject is deleted, a general meaning
(English “one”. German/Nordic “man”, French “on’”) is obtained:
       Kad ddens smelas muté, jamacas peldét (Latvian proverb)
                                 THE VERB:     MOOD                                 131        When   the water is streaming into the mouth, one has to learn to
swim,        C. Alternative Constructions
        The debitive meaning can also be rendered in other ways, namely
by:
        a) the impersonal verb (cf. p. 206) vajadzet (pres. vajag, pret. va-
jadzéja), c.g. vinam vajag stradat he must work, $0 uzdevumu                     vajag
padarit this task has to be done (observe the accusative $0 uzdevumu
due to its object function dependent on (vajag) padarit — in contrast to
the example quoted under c) where Sis uzdevums is in the position of a
grammatical subject and therefore appears in the nominative case),
      b) the impersonal verb nakties (pres. nakas, pret. nacas): mums
nakas aizbraukt we have to leave (go),
      c) the passive m-participle: Sis uzdevums ir padarams this task
has to be done.
      Whereas the debitive construction implies objective necessity, the
vajadzét-construction designates obligation or moral necessity (English
shall/should), Classical contrastive illustrations are jums jadzer téja you
have to drink tea (because there is no coffee) and jums vajag dzert
téju you have to (= should) drink tea (because it is healthy/good for
you). The nakties-construction as a rule expresses inevitability (like the
impersonal verb prichodit’sya in Russian).","[126, 127, 128]"
"
      C. The Agentive
      This function may be said to be on the borderline between the ad-
nominal, the adverbal and adverbial functions. For matters of conveni-
ence we have placed it here after the adjective, since it is conditioned by
a participle, which syntactically has much in common with the adjective,
cf. p. 156.
                                    CASE                                169       The agentive (or agent) which is the performer of the action in
formally passive constructions, is expressed in Latvian by the genitive:
direktora parakstita véstule a / the letter written by the director (ein
/der vom Direktor geschriebene Brief). Observe that the agentive is
limited almost exclusively to noun phrases of the above type. It is very
rarely encountered in sentences, since formal passives with an explicit
agent are as a rule avoided in Latvian, cf. section on voice, p. 140. Note
also the obligatory word order (1. agent, 2. attributive participle, 3. head
noun) in the noun phrase just quoted, in contrast with parakstita direk-
tora véstule, which would mean “a/the written letter belonging to the
director” (with direktora in the function of a possessive genitive, cf. p.
 166 above and chapter 14 on word order, p. 227 below).","[165, 166]"
"
      The Equivalents of English Passives in Latvian
       Constructions with an Agent
       The previously mentioned active sentence the workmen are buil-
ding a house (with the word order subject-verb-object, or SVO) could be
translated into Lithuanian by an equally active SVO construction:
Darbinieki cel mdaju.
       The passive SVO-sentence ‘the house is being built by workmen’
should be expected to be rendered by the passive SVO construction
*maja tiek celta darbinieku / darbinieku celta. However, formally
passive sentences with an explicitly expressed agent are extremely
rare in Latvian, and should be avoided. A formally active sentence with
the word order object-verb-subject (OVS) is used instead: maju ce]
darbinieki (an exception to this rule is noun phrases, cf. pp. 169 and
227. The sentence maju ce] darbinieki has the same theme-rheme
structure as the English passive sentence ‘the house is being built by
workmen’. The same holds true for Pavilu sita Péteris in relation to
Paul was beaten by Peter.
      OVS-structures are far more common in case languages than in ca-
seless ones, since in the former sentence members in initial position are
                               THE VERB: VOICE                                 14]identified as cither object or subject by virtue of their grammatical form,
while in the latter where the initial position is earmarked for the function
of the subject, both in active and passive sentences.","[137, 138]"
"       B. Syntax
       Declinable    cardinal      numbers   (with   the   exception   of simts,
tukstotis, miljons) have adjectival syntax, i. e. they agree in gender,
number and case with an accompanying quantified noun: man ir divi
 lati / divas gramatas / have two lats / two books, es iedevu divus latus
/ divas gramatas savam draugam / gave two lats / two books to my
friend, vins ir atbraucis uz Rigu ar diviem latiem / divam gramatam
 he has come to Riga with two lats / two books.
       Indeclinable cardinal numbers         as well as simts, tikstotis,   and
miljons have substantival syntax, i. e. they behave like nouns by requi-
ring the genitive (plural) of the accompanying noun, e. g. (man ir)
desmit/vienpadsmit/divdesmit/simts/tikstotis/miljons latu/gramatu
(1 have) ten/eleven/twenty/hundred/thousand/one million lats/books
                                  NUMERALS                                   Tt(like celasoma latu/gramatu a suitcase of lats/books, cf. the partitive
adnominal genitive, p. 169 below).
       The claim that indeclinable numerals require a following genitive
needs an important modification since
      1) this rule is restricted to cases where the numeral — or to be more
precise, the numeral + noun group — occupies a nominative or accusative
position, i. e. as subject or object to a transitive verb (i. e. an accusative-
governing verb) or in the function of an adverbial of time; in other obli-
que cases the following noun must be in the genitive, dative or locative,
depending on the syntactic environment;
      2) in nominative (and partly accusative) position the noun can also
be in the nominative (or accusative with accusative representation).","[73, 74]"
"       Verbal One-Part Sentences      Verbal one-part sentences can be defined as one-part sentences
with a verbal principal member (for the term, see p. 198). This member
is usually in the 3rd person.
       1) The simplest structure is represented by sentences consisting of
the principal member only. Here belongs a group of verbs incapable of
taking an object, for instance, the “meteorological” aust become light/
dawn, tumst become       dark, lit rain, smidzinat drizzle, snigt snow, zi-
benot flash (of lightning), salt freeze.
       Examples: tumsa it was becoming dark, salst it is freezing, sniga
it was snowing. With some of the verbs a tautological noun in the nomi-
native case may be added, thus changing the structure into a personal
(automatically two-part) sentence: list or list lietus it is raining (lit. ‘the
rain is raining’).
        After phasal auxiliaries the above verbs will be in the form of an
infinitive, e.g. beidza lit it stopped raining. The combination saka lit
can be referred to as a compound verbal principal member (p. 198).
        In this place mention should also be made of the Latvian equiva-
lents of the man-sentences of German and the Nordic languages: raksta
one writes/is writing (man schreibt), meklé one searches/is searching
(man sucht), runa / teic / saka (ka ...) one says/it is said (that ...), man
sagt, (dass ...) etc. Such sentences are one-part, but personal. Also here
the infinitive must be used after phasal auxiliaries, e.g. saka rakstit one
began writing (man fing an zu schreiben).
       2) Adverbial   extensions (on extension, see p. 199) are possible,
e.g. Vakar visu dienu nepartraukti lija yesterday it was raining
uninterruptedly all day long; par to rakstija avizés one writes about
that in the papers / it is being written about that in the newspapers.
The adverbials used here are optional, in the sense that they are not
required by the valence of the verb.
       3) One part-sentences with a verbal principal member can have an
obligatory object in the accusative, genitive or dative.
       A. An accusative object is found in cases like kugi Sipo the ship
is rocking (lit. ‘it is rocking the ship’).
       B. The genitive object is typical of negative existential construc-
tions: nav sniega there is no snow. Grammatically sniega has to be
classified as an object, even though from a logical point of view it can be
conceived as a subject. Here belong also constructions with trikt be
                                THE SENTENCE                                     207lacking, e.g. trukst sniega sow iv lacking (and, of course, netrukt not
be lacking: sniega netrukst).
      C. The function of a grammatical object, but logical subject is also
observed in the dative in sentences of the type vinai veicas (infintive
veikties) she is lucky.
      Here on may also mention debitive constructions: man jastrada /
have to work, cf. p. 129 ff.","[203, 204]"
"        5. The Anaphoric Pronoun of the 3rd Person
       This pronoun is identical in form and inflection with the
demonstrative pronoun tas/ta in section 4 and corresponds to English
“it” (sg.), “they” (pl.). In grammars of Latvian this function is usually
not found under a separate heading. The anaphoric pronoun refers to and
agrees in gender and number with a noun (common noun or proper
name) mentioned in the preceding sentence:
       Riga ir Latvijas galvaspilséta. Taja ir apméram viens miljons —
       iedzivotaju
        Riga is the capital of Latvia. It has (lit. in it (there) is/are) about
one million inhabitants.
      Govs ir labs dzivnieks. Ta mums dod pienu
      The cow is a good animal. It gives us milk.
      As illustrated by the two examples just quoted, the tas/ta prono n
in anaphoric function is used with reference to non-persons (things and
animals). If a person is referred to, the personal pronoun (vins/vina) it
usually applied, e. g.                                                            :
        Pagalma spéléjas daZi bérni. Vini bija latviesi
                                 THE PRONOUN                                69        In the yard there were some children playing. They were
        Latvians.
        The tas/ta anaphoric pronoun can also refer to animate beings, but
 primarily in an introductory function:
        Istaba ienaca meitene. Ta bija Jana masa
        A girl entered the room. It was John’s sister.
        If vina is used instead of ta in the last sentence quoted, the
 translation would be as follows: She was John’s sister. As is seen from
 this example the personal pronoun (vina) also has an anaphoric function.","[65, 66]"
"      Il THE POSITION OF THE MEMBERS                           OF THE
      NOUN PHRASE
      A noun phrase can be defined as a word group (vdrdkopa) con-
sisting of a combination of two or more words of a nominal class, consti-
tuting a semantic unit. One word (a noun) in the group occupies the role
of grammatical head, under which the other constituent/s is/are subordi-
nated (through agreement, government or juxtaposition, see pp. 200 and
215).",[223]
"      THE VOCATIVE
      The vocative is the case of address.
      For examples, see chapter on adjective (p. 62), where information
about the form of both an attributive adjective and the noun is given.
                                                         Chapter 9                                           PREPOSITIONS
                                                                (Prievards)
      This is a natural continuation of the immediately preceding chapter
on Case, which we found convenient to reserve almost exclusively for
non-prepositional use, even though a full description of case should
include prepositions as well. The purpose of this chapter on prepositions
is to give a brief survey of the prepositions most commonly encountered
in modern Standard Latvian and information on the case(s) required after
them, their meanings presented in simple, illustrative examples. A less
practically oriented grammar should in addition have paid attention to a
number of theoretical, semantic and grammatical aspects concerning pre-
positions and case grammar.","[179, 180]"
"      We will proceed below according to the scheme 1 - 3 and describe
the functions of the cases in the following order: the genitive, the accu-
sative, the dative and the locative. The description will also include a
small typed note on the instrumental, for the status of which, see p. 41.
Finally, the functions of the two non-oblique cases, the nominative and
the vocative, will be dealt with.
166                                  CASE
        THE GENITIVE
       This is a widely used case in Latvian, which is encountered both
with and without prepositions (for prepositional use, see chapter 9:
“Prepositions“).
       The genitive has adnominal and adverbal functions, while the ad-
verbial seems to be absent.
       Under both the adnominal and adverbal types a partitive and non-
partitive function should be distinguished. The partitive genitive expres-
ses a part of a certain quantity, as for example in tasite téjas a cup of
tea (adnominal type) and ést s€nu to eat mushrooms (adverbal type).","[162, 163]"
"
       3. Tone
         Tone in Latvian consists of different intonational patterns realized in long sylla-
bles (i. e. long vowels, diphthongs and semi-diphtongs, cf. above).
         Depending on the dialect three different tones or intonations are discernable, na-
mely the even tone (stiepta intondacija), written in linguistic texts with the symbol ~ , the
falling tone (kritosa intondcija), written as ~, and the broken tone (lauztd intondcija),
written as ~.
        The even and the falling tones do not need much comment: in the former case
the vowel/diphthong is pronounced on a level tone throughout, in the latter, the tone
starts more intensely and falls off towards the end. The broken tone is segmented into
two parts in a way which reminds one of a weakened Danish stgd (glottal catch). In
most areas in Latvia, however, only two intonational patterns are contrasted. Thus, in
some parts of the country the falling and even intonations have fused while, in others
the falling and the broken have done so. The latter pattern is the one found (among other
places) in Riga, where an even and a falling intonation are distinguished.
        In Contemporary Standard Latvian there are only very few minimal pairs with
oppositions consisting in tone alone. For example: zale [’za:le] grass vs. zale [‘za:le]
hall; \oks [luoks] garlic vs. logs [lu6éks] window vs. loks [lioks] bow.
        Tone may be said to be of much lesser importance than stress and quantity and
can be more or less ignored by the student — the more so because of the variations in the
system(s) mentioned above.
Chapter 2THE NOUN
(Lietvards)
        Grammatical Categories
      The grammatical categories of the Latvian noun are the same as
those of the other nominal parts of speech (adjective, pronoun, numeral),
namely gender, number and case. Some general remarks should be made
about these categories:        1. Gender
        (Dzimte)
     There are only two genders, masculine and feminine, in Latvian.
The masculine is the unmarked member of this binary opposition which
is seen (among other things) in the fact that it is the masculine and-not
the feminine which has replaced the lost neuter in examples like ir skai-
drs, ka it is clear that and others. To a certain extent, adverb        forms
ending in -i can be said to fill the gap after the loss of the neuter, in such
constructions as vinai ir auksti she feels (lit. is) cold, vs. the unmarked
masculine adjective form in Sodien ir auksts today it is cold, cf. p. 207.
      Nouns are said to have an inherent gender, expressed through
agreement with modifiers (i. e. adjectives, participles, certain pronouns
and numerals).
       The rules for determination of gender in Latvian are simple, since
there is a very high degree of harmony between form and gender. Thus,
nouns ending in -s/-§, -is or -us (reflecting declensions 1-3, regarding
which    see below)   are masculine,   whereas   the remainder,    i. e. those
ending in -a, -e or -s (i. e. declensions 4-6) are feminine. Exceptions are
those very few nouns ending in -a which refer to male persons, where the
gender is determined by the biological gender (sex), e.g. puika boy.
Further, a few nouns ending in -a and -e can be of so-called common
gender (Latvian kopdzimte), which means that they are of masculine
gender if a male is referred to and feminine if a female is referred to,
e.g. nejéga idiot, bende (usually masc.) hangman, First names and
family names also comply with this rule.
                                  THE NOUN                                41       Finally, it should be added that masculine nouns ending in -s/-§
which denote occupations are regularly opposed to feminine nouns en-
ding in -e (-a after -j), e.g. direktors director : direktore woman di-
rector, skolotajs teacher : skolotaja woman teacher. When sex is un-
marked as, for example, in miisu fabrika tagad jauns direktors at our
factory there is now a new director (our factory now has a new di-
 rector) — the masculine form is used.
        Observe finally oppositions such as Kalnins Mr. K. : Kalnina
 Mrs./Miss K., Lacis Mr. L. : Mrs./Miss L. in Latvian surnames.","[36, 37, 38]"
"        For the use of the possessive pronoun, cf. also Nordic din idiot ‘you fool’ which
may represent a genitive form of the personal pronoun reinterpreted as a possessive. If
this interpretation is correct, we would in a historical perspective be dealing with a geni-
tivus definitivus, cf. p. 167f. Could the Latvian construction with an unambiguous
possessive pronoun be explained through Swedish intermediary? Besides this
construction,   Latvian   also has at its disposal   an alternative construction    with    the
personal pronoun which is known from a number of European languages: tu muJki.",[172]
"       2. The governing Word is an Adjective
       The adjective lidzigs alike, similar is construed with the dative,
e.g. vins ir lidzigs tévam he is like his father, Sis trijstiris ir lidzigs
otram trijstirim this triangle is similar to another/the other triangle.
Another dative governing adjective is derigs useful, e.g. gramatika ir
                                   CASE                                   177deriga studentiem grammar is useful to the students. In this case, the
use of the dative is easy to grasp, in opposition to lidzigs. Adjectives
with the meaning of similarity are, however, often construed with the
dative case in Indo-European languages: for example, German gleich
(mir), Lithuanian    lygus kam   ‘alike sby/sth.’,   Russian   ravno   (Cemu)
‘(a)like (sth.)’.
       Note that the adjectives vienlidzigs equal and proporcionals pro-
portional are not construed with the dative case, but with the preposition
ar (+ the accusative).
      For the dative with numerous adjective-like predicatives, see p.
179 below.","[173, 174]"
"      Formal Passives with Intransitive Verbs
      In a caseless language like English, passive participles are formed
from transitive verbs, i. e. verbs with an object. In case languages the
formation of passive participles is as a rule equally limited to transitive
verbs, but the definition of transitivity is different, since here transitive
verbs are understood to be verbs with an object in the accusative case. A
peculiarity of Latvian, however, is that formally “passive” constructions
are also possible with intransitive verbs.
       Thus, “passive” constructions of this type are frequently encounte-
red in Latvian. They must be in the form of a one-part impersonal sen-
tence (cf. p. 206) with the participle in the (unmarked) masculine
(singular) form (see p. 40). A much quoted example in grammars of
Latvian is diezgan jau ir staigats lit. it has been walked quite a lot al-
ready. A parallel example would be visu nakti bija dejots, lit. it was
danced all night long. Note the correspondence with English construc-
tions with a formal (semantically empty subject) it.
      These were examples of intransitive (or intransitively used) verbs.
A verb such as threaten is transitive in English. Its Latvian correspon-
dence draudét is intransitive, since it requires a dative, not accusative,
object. To translate a sentence like he was threatened into Latvian, one
would prefer to say vinam draudéja, i. e. use a formally               active

      REFLEXIVE AND NON-REFLEXIVE VERBS
      (Atgriezeniskie und tieSie darbibas vardi)       In this section the functions and meanings of the reflexive verbs in
contrast with non-reflexive verbs will be described. For the formal
expression of reflexives and non-reflexives, see pp. 85-114 above.","[139, 140]"
"       Non-Participle Attributes
       Examples: jauna maja (a) new house (agreement), téva maja fa-
ther’s house (government). These are simple word groups in opposition
to complex: jauna téva maja father’s new house.
       A typical example of “juxtaposition” (p. 200) could be the
combination of a verb and an adverb (e. g. iet atri to walk fast), but
verbal word groups of this kind have practically already been dealt with
under I above.
       The neutral position of attributes, both congruent (expressed by
adjectives, adjectival pronouns and numerals) and non-congruent
(expressed by nouns and certain pronouns), is before the governing noun,
i.e. jauna maja (maja jauna would be understood as the house is
new), téva maja (but: vina jauna maja his new house), alus pudele a
new house, father’ house, a beer bottle. Exceptions to this rule are
rare, but can be found in poetry (e. g. no malaja smaga from the heavy
               eeeeemenmene                 —

BelSevica)).
      Note the opposition between piecas stundas / desmit kilometru
five hours / ten kilometers and stundas piecas / kilometru desmit
some/around five hours | some/around ten kilometers. The order noun
+ numeral (inversion) implies approximate number.
       With the adnominal partitive genitive postposition is the normal
(and mandatory) order: pudele alus a bottle of beer.
       Further, the congruent attributive is normally placed before the
non-congruent, i. e. jauna téva maja father’s new house, rather than
*téva jauna maja.
       In sequences of the type all these my beautiful flowers the order
of words is determinative pronoun + demonstrative + possessive + adjec-
tive: visas Sitas manas skaistas pukes.
       Observe finally the order of words in “genitive strings”, e.g.

Department of English language of (at) the Faculty of Philology of

languages etc., in Latvian the broadest concept occupies the leftmost
position, the narrowest the rightmost.","[223, 224]"

      3. Prepositions designating the Instrument
      There is one preposition in this function, namely:
      ar (+ accusative): rakstit ar zimuli write with a pencil, braukt
ar vilcienu go by train
       This function corresponds to the non-prepositional instrumental
case in Slavic case languages (and Lithuanian).",[186]
"
           2. Possessive Pronouns       A. Non-Reflexives
       The pronouns of this class might also be labeled personal, along
with the preceding ones. It has, however, become customary to group
them under a separate heading as possessive pronouns, according to their
specialized function. The group encompasses mans/-na my/mine, tavs/-
va your(s), savs/-va one’s own (declined as short form adjectives, cf. p.
57-58) and vina his, vinas her(s), musu our(s), jisu your(s), and vinu
their(s), which are all undeclined regardless of the gender, number and
case of the word to which they refer.
       The latter five are merely the genitive case of the corresponding
personal pronouns (see point 1 above). The others (mans, tavs, savs) are
declined like the short form of the adjective (type masc. labs, fem.
laba).
           Examples using possessive pronouns:
           mans/misu bralis; mani/misu brali; mana/miisu masa; manas
/miisu masas / mana/misu gramata; manas/misu gramatas my / our
brother / brothers / sister / sisters | book / books; par tavam grama-
tam about your books; Si gramata ir jisu this book is yours, seit ir
vinas bralis here is her brother.
                                  THE PRONOUN                                      67       B. Reflexives
       The reflexive possessive refers to the subject of the sentence re-
gardless of the person and number expressed by the subject, i. e. es
panému savu gramatu, tu panémi savu gramatu, vins/vina panéma
savu gramatu,      més   panémam       savas gramatas, jus panémat             savas
gramatas,    vini/vinas panéma         savas gramatas / took my book, you
took your book, he took his book, she took her book, we took our bo-
oks, you took your books, they took their books.
       The sav-form, like its non-possessive counterpart - sevis, sevi etc.
(p. 66), can never be part of the subject syntagm. Thus, a sentence such
as *sava gramata ir te is impossible. Only when the meaning is that of
one’s own, is sav-s/-a encountered in the function of a subject, e. g. ka-
tram ir sava gramata each one has his/her/their own book.","[63, 64]"
"
        Difficulties in distinguishing Objects from Adverbials
        It is often difficult to distinguish between an object and an adverbial. In the case
of prepositional phrases it is crucial whether there is only one possible and obligatory
preposition required by the verb or whether more (non-verb) determined prepositions
can be applied. The former situation is an indication of an object: piederét pie grupas
belong to a group, the latter of an adverbial, e.g. braukt no Rigas go from Riga,
braukt uz Rigu go to Riga.
        A practical test often used is that adverbials answer questions with an adverb, in        i!q
contrast to the object, which is determined by a question with a pronoun. Thus, in the
sentence laukos vipa man katru dienu atnes no darza abolu in the countryside she
brings me an apple from the garden every day the dependent members man and abolu
answer the pronominal questions kam? for whom? and ko? what? whereas katru
dienu and taukos answer questions with the adverbs kad? / cik biezi? when? / how
often? and kur? where? respectively. For determining the character of no darza,
however, both the question with an adverb (no kurienes? from where?) and that with a
pronoun (no ka? from what?) seems possible. The conclusion is that the test is not
applicable in every case. This means that additional criteria must be used. By comparing
no darza in the above sentence with, for cxample, no darza in muiZa sastav no darza
un lielas majas the estate consists of a garden and a big house one feels the much
closer connection with the verb in the latter case which allows us to speak of a
prepositional object as opposed to an adverbial in the former, i. e. in [...] atnes no
darza abolu).                      oo.",[198]
"        I Adverbal Accusative        Latvian verbs can govern different oblique cases, the genitive, the
accusative,   the dative and the locative. The     absolute majority    of the
174                                   CASEverbs, however, require the accusative (as a direct object) and are called
transitive, e.g. lasit vestuli to read a     letter, uzbuvét   maju to build a—
house.
       A basic feature of verbs with the accusative is that they can be
transferred from active to passive forms, cf. lasit véstuli / uzbuvét
maju to read a letter / to build a house : lasama véstule / uzbuvéta
maja, cf. p. 157.
       A special type of accusative object, so-called “inner object” is en-
countered in cases like domat domu lit. to think a thought, dziedat
dziesmu fo sing a song, dejot deju to dance a dance.
       In opposition to the Slavic languages, where reflexive verbs are
more or less incapable of governing the accusative case, this restriction is
not observed to the same extent in Baltic, where an accusative object can
also be governed by a reflexive verb: for example, nopirkties jaunu
velosipédu to buy a new bicycle, macities matematiku to learn
(study) mathematics, izgaidities vilcienu to wait for the train, at-
ceréties pasaku fo recall a fairy-tale. The meaning of the reflexive is
here “in one’s own interest” (cf. p. 143 under reflexive and non-reflexive
verbs).
       Since the number of verbs governing other cases than the accusa-
tive is rather limited, it is customary to to present lists of verbs gover-
ning the other oblique cases, not the accusative, because such a list would
be very long and therefore impossible in a grammar. It belongs naturally
in the dictionary.
          Also more than one object may occur. Thus, the combination da-
tive + accusative is frequent (see also under the dative case p. 177), with
the indirect object (denoting a person) in the dative, and the direct
(denoting a thing) in the accusative, e.g. dot/sutit kadam (dative) ko
(accusative) to give/send sby sth.
       Finally, the accusative in the function of an object predicative in
cases like the following should be mentioned:
       més vinu pazistam ka labu arsti we know her as a good physi-
cian.","[170, 171]"
"       1. Prepositions of Place
       A distinction can be drawn between directional and non-directio-
nal (locational) prepositions. Here, however, it should be borne in mind
that one preposition, e.g. uz, can have both functions (provided that one
is willing to accept that it is one preposition and not two homonyms).
Further, a preposition like virs above, over can refer to position, but
also movement above (over) a place. A similar duality is also seen with
other prepositions, for example, in starp between which can express
location, but also passage    between   two   objects.   In addition we   are
faced with the fact that in Latvian, unlike Lithuanian, Slavic, German
and many other case languages movement into is expressed not by a
preposition + the accusative, but usually with the locative, which in
Slavic (and its substitute, the dative, in German) is reserved for location
in, not movement into.",[183]
"        Reduplication
        Latvian adjectives can be strengthened by reduplication, cf., for
example, gargars very long (gargara pasaka a very long fairy-tale),
zilzils very blue, dzildziJ§ very deep.
                                                            Chapter 4                                                THE PRONOUN
                                                             (Vietniekvards)
       The pronoun is a heterogeneous word class. The following
description will be based on more or less traditional classificatory crite-
ria.
       Many pronouns are characterized by a special pronominal inflec-
tion, whereas others follow the pattern of adjectives.
       In terms of syntax a distinction is often made between adjectival
and non-adjectival (substantival) pronouns. Whereas the former are sub-
ordinated to a head noun in gender, number and case (attributive func-
tion), the latter can be used “independently” like a noun. Certain pro-
nouns can be used in both the adjectival and substantival function.","[61, 62]"
"        There are two kinds of agreement: formal (or grammatical), and logical
(semantic). The explanation above relates only to the former type. To cover logical
agreement, the definition should be modified as follows: systematic covariation between
a formal or semantic property of one element and a formal property of another. An
example of logical agreement would be: jau ir atnakuSi liels daudzums gaju putnu a
large number of birds of passage have already arrived, whereas formal agreement
would be jau ir atnacis liels daudzums gaju putnu a /arge number of birds of pas-
sage has arrived with the participle atnacis in agreement with (liels) daudzums in
gender, number and case (nominative). The English translation illustrates logical vs.
216                                  AGREEMENTformal agreement with respect to number. From a normative point of view, the use of
formal agreement seems to be preferable for the case in question, as far as Latvian is
concerned,       Agreement can be regarded from two different angles:
       I that of the grammatical categories (i. e. 1-4)
       II that of the syntactic relations (i. e. A-C).
       The exposition below will follow I. It should also be pointed out
that emphasis will be put on special cases which may cause trouble for
the student, rather than uncomplicated ones like those alraedy quoted in
the above illustrations.","[212, 213]"
"        Furthermore, in Latvian tradition dubultloceklis (lit. “double member”) and ie-
robezajs (lit. “limitator”) are encountered. The former refers to the subject or the object
and at the same time to the predicate, and may be regarded as a special kind of attribute
(“predicative attribute”), whereas the latter is functionally close to the object or the ad-
verbial and can be attributed to one of them.
                              THE SENTENCE                             197      The Principal Members      The Subject
      (PriekSmets)       Here we have in mind the grammatical subject, which is most fre-
quently expressed by a noun or a pronoun in the nominative case. It can
also be expressed by a nominal form of the verb, i. e. the infinitive. For
examples, see under predicate below. In one-part sentences (for defini-
tion, see next chapter / section) there is no grammatical subject.","[193, 194]"
"         SYNTAX             OF THE ADJECTIVES         1. The Short (Indefinite) Form
         As already mentioned, the Latvian adjective has the following
three functions: (1) attributive, (2) appositive, and (3) predicative. This —
holds true for all degrees of comparison, i. e. the positive, the compara-
tive, and the superlative.
       Example of predicative function: istaba ir maza the room is
small.
       Note the use of the dative case in predicative function in general
statements and when the logical subject is in the dative: nav ir viegli but
mazam          (masc.)/mazai      (fem.) it is not easy (for anyone) to be small,
Janim nav viegli but mazam it is not easy for John to be small, levai
nav viegli but mazai it is not easy for Eve to be small.
      In functions (1) and (2) the short (indefinite) form is used in the
environments where the long (definite) form (see p. 61 f.) is not used.
Thus, the short form is encountered in the rhematic function (p. 221), i.
e. it designates something which is new or unknown in the situation or
context        (“new      information”):    maza         meitene a   little girl (note the
indefinite article in English).
         In function 3) the short form is used, e.g. meitene                  ir maza the
girl is small.",[57]
"         Examples:
      upe [‘up:e] river, kakis [‘katjis] cat, klusa [‘klus:a] (fem. sg.
nom. of kluss) silent; quiet, kluéa [‘klutf:a] (gen. sg. of klucis) block.
       Note: consonant length is in this case not reflected in the ortho-
graphy in contrast to:
       b) words like balle ball, feast, dilemma dilemma where one long
consonant is pronounced, i. e. [l:] and [m:] respectively. Such gemina-
tion in orthography is not characteristic of Latvian, but is found in a—
number of borrowings (such as those just mentioned). In autochthonic
(indigenuous) words they are encountered only very rarely (e. g. mellene
[‘mel:ene] blueberry),
      c) two consonants in word final position are pronounced as one
semi-long consonant. This pertains also to cases where two consonants in
this environment become identical as the result of an assimilation (p. 26):
ass (masc. sg. nom.) sharp, balss (masc. sg. nom.) voice, pareizs
[‘pareis-] correct, mezs [meJ-] forest.
       d) a long (or semi-long) consonant is also pronounced where there
is a prefix ending in the same consonant as the initial consonant of the
word root, for example attistiba [‘at:i:sti:ba] development, parraidit
[‘pa:r:aidi:t] broadcast. The same holds true for instances like atdot
[‘ad:uot] return, give back. Observe further compounds of the type pus-
sala [‘pus:ala] peninsula, lappuse [‘lap:use] page.
        In all other instances short consonants are spoken. It should be
emphasized that quantity relations may differ from those found in most
of the modern Germanic languages (English, German, Dutch, the Nordic
languages), since Latvian can have short consonants between short
                                      PHONOLOGY                                           39vowels, as for example           in labi [‘labi] well, maza           [‘maza]    (fem.    sg.
nom.) small.","[35, 36]"
"        The same kind of assimilation is known in English. In Nordic languages the
same phenomenon is observed in the case of nk. For ng it should be added that in many
cases [n] is spoken alone, without the subsequent [g], in Nordic.",[24]
"        3. Non-Prefixal Compositions
        Only a few examples need be given:
ziemassvétki          (noun    in the genitive       case   in the    first component)
Christmas, lieldienas (adjective without connecting or stem vowel in the
first component) Easter, pirmdiena (ordinal number without connecting
56                             THE NOUNor stem vowel in the first component) Monday, édamistaba (participle
without connecting or stem vowel in the first component) dining room,
stavlampa (verb stem in the first component) floor lamp.
      In translating, for example, bookshop into Latvian, one may be in
doubt as to whether a suffixal formation gramatnica, the compound          ~
gramatveikals (without connecting vowel) or a two word genitive
combination gramatu veikals would be preferable. The latter strategy is
very frequent in Latvian, cf. priezu mezZs pine forest, sudraba karote
silver spoon, kafijas tasite coffee cup, while German and the Nordic       —
languages make much wider use of compounds (Tannenwald, furuskog          —
etc.)                                                      /

                                                             (IpaSibas vards)
        General Characteristics
        The Latvian adjective appears in two variants: the short (or inde-
finite) and the long (or definite) respectively.
        Both forms are declined in gender, number and case. In addition,
many adjectives (i. e. the qualitative ones) are inflected according to de-
grees of comparison, whereby the comparative and the superlative are
distinguished from the positive.
        Two genders are distinguished: masculine and feminine.
        In the field of syntax the Latvian adjective distinguishes between
three functions:
        1. attributive,
      2. appositive, and
       3. predicative.
       In functions 1) and 2) there is agreement (see chapter 13) between
the noun and the adjective in gender, number and case whereas in 3)
there is agreement with the subject with respect to gender and number
(chapter 13). For the special case of the predicate adjective in debitive
constructions, again chapter 13 should be consulted.","[52, 53, 54]"
"        According to V. Rike-Dravina (1977,    121) the word order VS is more frequ-
ently used in recent years. She quotes the example iet stradnieks un doma: [...] there
goes a worker and thinks: [...]. Itis not clear to me whether this tendency — if Rike-
Dravina's observation is correct — is due to influence from Russian or not.
 224                             WORD   ORDER       In sentences after direct speech, both the SV and VS are found in
 more or less free variation: - Né, - atbildéja zéns_/ - Né, - zéns atbilde-
“ja “No”, the boy answered. If in such cases the subject is expressed by
 a pronoun, the order SV seems to be preferred: - Né, - vinS atbildéja
  “No“, he answered.","[220, 221]"
"       Declensional Types
       The Latvian noun is usually grouped into 6 declensional classes,
three masculine (1-3) and three feminine (4-6).
       Thus, the Latvian noun inflection constitutes a symmetrical gen-
der- determined system. The endings are vocalic in the nominative plural
of the masculine declensions, consonantal in those of the feminine. In the
nominative singular, the situation is almost the reverse, with consonantal
endings in declensions 1-3, vocalic in 4 and 5.
       In addition, the following generalizations should be mentioned:
       All six declensions have the ending -u in the genitive plural. The
dative(-instrumental) plural ends in V(owel) + m, the accusative and the
locative plural in short V + s and long V + s, respectively. The vocative
plural is always identical with the nominative plural.
       Furthermore, in declensions 1-3 the plural case endings are the
same. Declensions 4-6 have a different set of essentially identical plural
endings; only the vocalic constituent varies.
       Consonant alternations (according to the principles set forthon p.
24-25) are encountered in declensions 2, 5 and 6.",[39]
"       B. Syntax
       Ordinal numbers have adjectival syntax, i. e. they agree with the
 head noun in gender, number and case, e. g.       vina jau desmitaja klasé she is already in the tenth form         Years and dates are expressed by ordinal numbers.
         To answer the question when? the locative case is used for the
 year: vins ir dzimis tikstoS devinsimt devindesmit sestaja gada he is
 born in the year 1996.
         The Jocative is also used for answering the when-question for da-
 tes, e. g. Vins atbrauca piecpadsmitaja augusta he arrived on August       In the case of a month-year      combination with a when-question,
  the date appears in the locative case whereas the year has the form of
  a preposited adnominal genitive (cf. p. 158 below): vins ir dzimis
  tikstos devinsimt devindesmit sesta gada piecpadsmitaja augusta he
“is born on August 15, 1996.
         For translating a sentence like ‘today is August 15, 1996’ the no-
 minative, not the locative, of the date expression must be used (because
 syntactically it occupies the function of a grammatical subject): Sodien ir
 tuikstoS devinsimt devindesmit sesta gada piecpadsmitais augusts.
       In written exposition numerals are, of course, usually encountered
 instead of written-out number words.",[76]
