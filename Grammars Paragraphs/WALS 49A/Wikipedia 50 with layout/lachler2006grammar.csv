Besides its use as an interrogative and an indefinite nominal, dzii is also frequently used toadd a degree of uncertainty to astatement. In such cases, dzii may translate as ‘perhaps, if                                                      80

"If we look closely at the verbs in (14), we'll see that in all three cases it is   John's role that isbeing marked in the PRMP prefix.

Based on these data, we can develop a hypothesis about the relationship between a noun'sactivation status (CITE) and morphosyntactic status. When a noun is mentioned for the firsttime, it will tend to occur in pre-verbal position, signalling its maximally unactivated status;this is the case in examples (13) and (14). A noun which has been mentioned recently in thediscourse, and therefore is somewhat activated, will tend to occur in a post-verbal position,as in examples (15), (17), (18) and (20).       Finally,   a noun which has been mentioned veryrecently and/or often in the discourse, and therefore is highly activated, will not bementioned at all, and its role in the sentence will be left up to the interpretation of the                                                309

"2.2.2,.2.3. A Revised AccountThe basic crux of the problem with voiceless vowels in Laguna is that they are, by and large,quite predictable in their distribution.

"It is for this reason that Laguna cannot be analyzed as having a fourth person or an obviative,as Miller and Valiquette have done. In true obviative systems, such as those in Algonquianlanguages, the distinction between the third and fourth person is maintained across both(di)transitive and intransitive clauses, which is not the case in Laguna.   Since the distinctionapplies only in transitive and ditransitive clauses, it is not robust enough to be a function asa full-fledged reference-tracking system. Instead, it is simply a topic-tracking device whichworks across chains of closely tied transitive clauses.",[176]
"                                               237
While Miller and Valiquette analyze these forms as still being auxiliary verbs, I choose totreat these simply as suffixes for the following reasons:1. They do not have the canonical -VCV(CV)- shape of the verb stem/theme found withother (prefixing) verbs. In many cases, the verb theme appears to be simply -a- -- that is,just a stem vowel, and no more stem after it.","[251, 252]"
"These two rules of vowel devoicing and obstruent aspiration, applied in that order, accountfor the large majority of fully voiceless syllables in Laguna.      For example:(39a)    s'aapakéawany'i                     ‘my axe’(39b)    kidrayape                           ‘you (pl) ate’(39c)    dyaamihanutsida                     ‘Tam Eagle clan’(39d)    dziwaéhimatyishe                    ‘those who believe, the believers’(39e)    dzitmishchitsita                    ‘he/she is fainting’However, there are a number of problematic cases which do not seem to fit this generalpattern. I discuss each of these below.",[48]
"Note that neither Miller nor Valiquette included the Slot 2 Number prefixes in the verbtheme.   For Miller, at least, all number marking is inflectional, and as such is outside thetheme. Valiquette is less commital on the topic, but still in the end excludes number fromthe theme, except in cases of themes which are suppletive for number.",[203]

"2.2.2.2.2.3 Lexical Exceptions
Beyond these two cases discussed above, both of which could arguably be handled in oneway or another by appealing to the morphological status of the words involved, there arequite a few other words where the devoicing and aspiration rules simply fail to apply, for noclear reason.   For example:(45a)      srbiga              (not: *srbika)                ‘woodpecker’(45b) édze                     (not: *étse                   ‘and’

Whereverpossible in this dissertation, I have used examples drawn straight from Boas's corpus toillustrate a point. These examples have been rechecked with current speakers as to theirmeanings, though not all of them were fully retranscribed, so there may be someremaining transcriptional errors carried over from the original texts. In other cases, Ihave used data from my own field sessions, or, where needed, forms from Valiquetteand/or Miller's work.",[24]

Quantifiers can also stand alone in the sentence, without any noun to modify. In these cases,the quantifiers themselves act a type of quantificational pronoun, e.g.       sai/saiyu                          ‘all of them’       hats'u                             ‘some of them’       n'auya                             ‘many of them’Another possible analysis is that they act of modifiers of the pronominal arguments markedon the verb.

6.1.3 Other Uses of Quantifiers
Some quantifiers have other uses beyond those described above. Some can occur as degreeadverbs, describing the extent to which an action was carried out.

[Boas 10.051]Hats'u can be used as a question word, meaning ‘How many?’                  or ‘How much?’(8)     Sh'ee        ee-dyaadziya                dzigana,            “Hats'udzaapaP""       then        thus they said IND       _— again                they PL are how many DIR       Then they spoke again, ""How many are there?"" [Boas 16.0221}6.2 Numbers
Numbers are an interesting class of words in Laguna.                Like quantifiers, they can be used
                                                   126
either as modifiers or as nominals.","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141]"
"An exception to this pattern is found, however, in the case of reduplication.   Compare thefollowing forms:(42a)     ésuse                           ‘I sneezed (once)’(42b)      ésu'ésuse                      ‘T sneezed alot’(42c)     ésu'ésusidye                    ‘we sneezed’In these cases, note that the second syllable /su/ is fully devoiced to /su/, even when thenext syllable has a -'- in the onset.   To accommodate these data, it would appear that wewould need to order the rule of reduplication after the rules of vowel devoicing and
                                              35
consonant aspiration.    Although not impossible, this is particularly odd since devoicingotherwise seems to be a very low-level, phonetic, post-lexical sort of rule, whereasmorphologically-significant reduplication would typically be thought of as occurring muchearlier in the derivational process.","[49, 50]"
"9.3.1 Simple Transitive Themes
Simple transitive themes have the following properties:       * They haveno Voice prefix or Benefactive suffix. Their singular forms have no number       prefix, either, so in that case the stem and the theme are identical.",[207]

"In all four of these cases, the Direct mood is used because the speaker needs the listener toaccept the assertion that the information in the dependent clause is true, before they caninterpret the rest of the sentence. For instance, in (4), the listener needs to accept that it was,in fact, raining, before they can accept that the raining stopped.

While the simple copula is most often found with nouns, it can also be used with adjectives,as in (5).

Within a noun phrase, the adjective can come either before or after the noun. In either case,the simple copula will cliticize onto the final element in the phrase, pace Valiquette(1990:96) who claims that the copula will always cliticize to the noun and not the modifier.","[255, 256, 257]"
This phenomenon may be what is behind the following quote from Miller (1965:12):   Acomais alenis language. This feature is characteristic in the speech of Acomas whether   speaking Acoma or English. The principal objection to my pronunciation of Acoma was   that I spoke with too much force.,[31]

       3. Another complication, which the table does not show, is the relationship between the       third person prefixes from Sets A and B. Note that both of these prefixes can be used       with transitive (or ditransitive) verbs, and that the resulting translation is the same in       both cases.

The only Natural nouns which felicitously occur possessed in Laguna are those which referto domesticated animals, such as kawaayu                    ""horse"" or dyiya   “dog”.     In this case,possession is expressed indirectly by means of an appositional construction involving thenominalized verb stem -adyaashe ""someone's pet"" along with the name of the animal thatis being possessed. So, for example, to say “his horse"" -- or, more acturately ""his pet horse”-- one says:(15) kawaayu             = ik'adyaashe       kawaayu__—ik-adyaa-she       horse                   3/3:DIR-have.as.pet-NMNLZ           ‘his (pet) horse’     lit. “horse, the one he has as a pet""In the example above, the Natural noun occurs first, and then the possessed form of the nounfor “pet"".      While this is a common order, the reverse order also occurs.            Two examples,drawn from the same story just a few lines apart, and referring to the same animal, are shownin (16).",[76]

The Set A prefixes seem to basically be subject prefixes, even in the case of       Impersonal verbs which have no subject either syntactically or semantically. Yet, with       transitive and ditransitive verbs they also seem to code for a third person argument,       either object or recipient.",[163]

Often the predicate in such a question is just a noun or pronoun, either singular or plural,with no verb.",[111]
"7.2.3 Valiquette on LagunaValiquette (1990), working with data from Laguna, provides a third different analysis of thissystem.   For him, the prefixes that occur on the intransitive verbs are the same as those thatoccur on transitive verbs, without exception. In fact, under his analysis, those prefixes arenot even polysemous.     Thus, the si- prefix on siukacha J saw him/her/it’ marks a firstperson subject and a third person object (or, using his terms, a first person argument 1, anda third person argument 2), while the si- prefix on siudraach'a ‘J fell off’, also marks afirst person subject and a third person object. The only difference between the two is thatin the latter case the object argument is a dummy.",[167]
"Firstly, length distinctions are lost.   All vowels before a syllable-final /‘/ are short, or adiphthong. Note that this is not the case with vowels occurring before a /'/ which is in theonset of the following syllable; in this environment, length distinctions are maintained, andboth long and short vowels are found.",[62]
"He takes the same approach with Set B intransitives such as -uhima ‘believe’, except thatin this case, with a form such as srguhima        ‘ believe’, the prefix codes a dummy third                                              153
person subject (argument 1) and a (real) first person object (argument 2). He carries this lineof argumentation to its logical conclusion by analyzing impersonal verbs such as kacha ‘itis raining’ as having both a dummy third person subject and a dummy third person object.","[167, 168]"
"In (5), we see singular, dual and plural examples of the Reflexive verb theme -aukacha-‘see self”.(5a)       s'-a-ukacha                        ‘Tsaw myself’           1ACT:DIR-RFLX-see

Another common reflexive prefix is -uu-, as shown in (6).             Note how in this case thereflexive prefix completely replaces the stem vowel.(6a)       s'-ibuutsa                         ‘I frightened him’           1ACT:DIR-frighten.sb(6b)       s-uu-buutsa                        ‘I frightened myself”           1ACT:DIR-RFLX-frighten.sbNote also how in both (5) and (6), the allomorph of the PRMP prefix changes between theSimple Transitive theme and its corresponding Reflexive theme.","[210, 211]"

Beyond this, the main challenge lay with Boas's transcription. Although he was able torecord a huge amount of text during his fairly short visit to the region, he did not spendenough time with the language to grasp the full inventory of contrastive sounds.       Forinstance, Boas failed to distinguish between the alveopalatal fricative /sh/ and theretroflex fricative /sr/, writing them both as <c>, and he also failed to recognize theglottalized series of nasals and glides. More importantly, however, Boas failed to notemany of the voiceless vowels found so commonly in Laguna words.          In some cases hewrote them with a superscript vowel; other times he simply noted aspiration on thepreceding consonant; while other times he made no record of them at all. Vowel lengthand tone were also problematic areas.",[23]
"Word order within the phrase and phrase order within the sentence are quite free inLaguna.     Adjectives, demonstratives, quantifiers and relative clauses can all occur eitherbefore or after their head noun.   Adverbs tend to occur before the verb, but subjects andobjects can appear either before or after the verb, with newer information occurring pre-verbally and older information occurring post-verbally.",[26]
"A similar analysis holds for the following example:(10)   Sh'ee       duwa_       ch'upe_     kinaatyi        ee     meruuni...       then        this        eat itIMP   com             and    melon

Chapter 6Quantifiers and Numbers
6.1 Quantifiers
Quantifiers are a group of words which refer to quantities or amounts.         Some commonquantifiers include:        sai, saiyu              ‘all’        n'auya                  ‘many, a lot’        hats'u                  ‘some’        k'uimi                  ‘a little’While this is primarily a semantic grouping, distributional evidence shows that all quantifierscan be used either as modifiers or as pronouns.","[133, 134]"

[Boas 13.041-042]If the main verb of the sentence is transitive and hauwi is acting as the subject with anotherthird person human as the direct object, the verb will typically carry the appropriate form ofthe third person patient pronominal prefix, since in this case the direct object will usually bemore topical than the unknown and unspecified subject (see Chapter 7).","[114, 115]"
"The prefix carries information from four different grammatical categories: person, role,mood and polarity. As such, we have chosen the acronym PRMP prefix. Here in chapter7 we will focus on describing and understanding the categories of person and role, savingmood and polarity for chapter 8.",[154]
"Laguna is a polysynthetic, split-intransitive tonal language, with discourse-drivenconstituent order. It is typologically interesting in several ways, including the presenceof a series of phonemic voiceless vowels, the grammaticization of mood as an obligatoryinflectional category for verbs, and the use of an obviation-like system for tracking anddisambiguating reference in transitive clauses.
This dissertation, based on fieldwork with fluent speakers as well as a very large corpusof texts collected by Franz Boas in the 1920's, provides a basic description of the majorphonological, morphological and syntactic patterns in the language.

"The stem vowel is frequently fused with, or wholly replaced by, a Number prefix occurringin Slot 2 or a Voice prefix occurring in Slot 3. The other optional component of the verbtheme is the Benefactive suffix, which occurs in Slot 6.

The most fluent speakers -- those who are fluent both in conversational styles of thelanguage as well as its ceremonial use -- most likely number in the low hundreds, and arefor the most part in their seventies or older. Very few middle-aged or younger residentsof the Pueblo have conversational ability in the language. It is still possible to hearLaguna being spoken conversationally within the community, and in some households(without children) it is still the dominant daily language. And in ceremonial contexts,Laguna is still the preferred language. However, on any given day, nearly all thespeakers of the language will speak more English than Laguna.
As such, Laguna Keres can be classified as an endangered language. Without a newgeneration of speakers, the language will likely no longer be spoken in another 30 years.","[15, 16]"
"7.2.4 Summary of Previous AnalysesDavis, Miller and Valiquette take three contrasting positions with regard to the overlapbetween the intransitive and transitive sets of pronominal prefixes. For Davis, the two setsare similar, but distinct, due to differences in their allomorphic behavior.    For Miller, theprefixes sets are apparently the same, but several of the prefixes are polysemous.
